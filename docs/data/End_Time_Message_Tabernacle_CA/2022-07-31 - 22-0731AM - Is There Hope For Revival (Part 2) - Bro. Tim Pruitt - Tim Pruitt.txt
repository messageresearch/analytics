quartet here this morning we're asked to sing so just ask him to come up and we'll just do that right now maybe we just come on up and we'll get ready here to sing that as well thank you [Music] who can be against us i've seen some valleys walk through some darkness waded through rivers of greece and the enemy told me that i was forsaken no one was fighting for me but i didn't make it this far on my own though often my strength was all gone the hands of a savior keep holding me up his promise of help is my song if god is for me who can stand against me [Music] if it's just me and jesus i can't be defeated when my god is with me i've got the victory every time [Music] he may be calling for you to follow to places you think you can't go and people will tell you that you'll never make it you can't win this fight all along if it's a choice to trust or to that just remember what he always does yet he'll never fail me and never will the battle [Music] is for me who can stand against me no weapon shall prosper for when god's on my side if it's just me and jesus i can't be defeated but my god is with me i've got the victory every time oh if god [Music] against me no heaven shall prosper when god's on my side if it's just me and jesus i can't be defeated my god is with me i've got the victory every time when my god is with me i've got the victory every time [Music] amen victory is in him hallelujah we're going to change the order of the service here this morning we'll ask our brothers to come why don't we stand not sure which way to go here fast or slow but i think we're going to go fast amen we're uh we're always facing battles it's a song that we've sang many times but you know what if you're a climber and god gives you the strength you can climb because there's mountains that will have to climb and it takes some stamina to go downward too if it's a steep valley well he'll take can give you strength to go down too but he's always there whether it's valleys or mountains or whatever it is but i thank god that we have someone beside us every day well we're always facing bad and it's hard to keep the base cause satan never lets him in his fight for when he plays but i'll have the lord to guide every step along the way so when satan comes against me you can't always hear me say well that's no hill four o'clock that's no battle for a child of god [Music] [Music] well every time i try to do a little something for my lord satan tries to block my [Music] he'll hear me [Music] satan's already been defeated and the victory's [Music] [Music] one more time that's no battle for a child of god satan's already been defeated and the victory [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh now satan get behind cause i clay [Music] the victory hallelujah hey man amen lord i love you o

cleanse you from every sin and to know the blood is the holy spirit when it's been applied to our hearts we are so thankful for that today amen god bless you don't want you to be alarmed because brother ron didn't come out with us and brother timothy they were delayed just for a moment but they'll be making their entrance here in just a little bit so you cannot worry about that we can get into the word of god he had a good night last night he's a warrior and he's recovered well and we'll be speaking tonight so no need for alarm amen it's um it's just um we're just so thankful for what god has done for our brother ron and my the powerful message we heard last night and the grace of god it just gives us gives us all uh a boost and encouragement and um we are so blessed by brother ron his ministry the lord is certainly using him in ways that would have never been done if just a miracle had taken place and and uh he hadn't had to go through this but to see him persevere under trial amen has been an inspiration to us all and i know many of you have drawn strength from that as i have and we have been so blessed to see the lord just bring him through one thing after another and god just coming on the scene you know i i remember what was a dozen years ago when i visit him in the hospital and um he had he had been in a very severe burn and they were not expecting him to live and and uh i walked into the hospital room and i felt like i had all the prayers of all the believers from everywhere around the world i i if i i said if i ever felt like a high priest then i felt it then you know where you you come in with the incense of all the other prayers and offering before god and we laid hands upon him and prayed with him there and i i told him i whispered in his ear and i said i have not come to to to anoint you for death i have come to anoint you for life and then we saw the holy spirit move and and and as i prayed i just said lord let me let me before i leave here because he had taken a turn for the worse even after that and the doctors had given up on him said he would die and and was about to harvest his organs you've heard the story and and uh i prayed there with my wife there at a crack of barrel as i went to see him i said lord i've got to leave today but don't let me leave without seeing my friend raised up from there and doing well and and we saw that victory as we before we left we saw him up talking and speaking and amen on his way to recovery and god's still god amen [Music] amen he's god on the mountain he's god in the valley he's god in our great troubles god is still god and he'll be god for you amen this morning so let's just talk to him right now as we just bow before the throne of grace and maybe as we would approach the father maybe you'd want to lift a hand to him and say lord don't pass me by you just minister to me in some way i need you father pass me not o gentle savior you're my humble cry [Music] while another you are calling let me reach out and get ahold of your garment today let my faith touch you lord you can even pull from the minister my faith can't even pull him to say things he didn't even have in his notes or he didn't think of and stop just by my pew and minister to me he knows my name he knows my situation he's a deserter of every thought intent of the heart lord jesus today i want to raise my hands to both of them i just need you i can't find the way without you i must have your leadership and guidance and i stand here lord in a very very tremendous place this morning to address this portion of your bride your people it's an awesome responsibility somewhat a terrible responsibility but lord you've ordained us and called us in this hour in this time and you're able to direct the word to the target exactly what is needed and there are many that have raised a hand towards you they didn't raise it toward me they know i can't help them i'm just a human like them immortal and i need you as much as they do but lord i pray today that as they lifted a hand towards you you being the intercessor our approach to spirit god is through the man christ jesus and we're so thankful you came and tasted humanity and experienced what we experienced so that we would have a high priest that we could go to who could be touched by the feelings of our infirmities who would know what it meant to be a man and suffer as men do and i pray lord that today you'll just respond to their need as i just take each one of them spiritually by the hand now they lifted the hand towards you and said lord i need you and i take them by the hand and before the throne right now and and i say jesus you see what your enemy the devil has done to your children your bride your spouse lord we know god as a man something would rise up in us if somebody was doing that to our wife we know something's got to move in your heart when you look on your people as we quote the prophet of god when satan takes after one of god's little ones he's got jesus christ on his hands lord today we're like esther we're like esther coming before the throne and we're saying this wicked haman this wicked one you see what he's been doing to your children you see what he's threatening to do move on our behalf move on to our behalf hang him on that same that same noose with that same noose that he had designed to destroy us destroy him i pray in the name of jesus that you'll intercede on the behalf of your people because you ever live to make intercession on behalf of our confession and we confess lord it's all paid for [Music] our debt is clean and we are clean before you so we can come boldly before your throne we can ask help in the time of need now as we look to the word lord [Music] as i said they're just thoughts lord i did my best to try to find a level of communication with you to find direction for these meetings but now lord i just pray that you'll step into me now oh god as i yield myself and surrender that you step into me as a man and you'll minister to your people thank you father thank you for this church this assembly thank you lord for his ministry and the ministry team here may they continue on as a lighthouse oh god for the end time message in this last day until you take us home and the lights go out in the last age now bless in the name of jesus the word that we are about to receive nourish it to our spiritual body in jesus name amen amen god bless you turn with me to matthew chapter 8 and verse 23 and i just want to say it's a joy to be together with you and have this privilege of serving the lord together thank you brother ed for all your kind hospitality and this wonderful invitation to be here and thank you to all the ministers that have come and and and uh supported the meeting it wouldn't be what it is without you and all the different folks from different places and the hometown here in edmonton we appreciate each one of you and i want to just say thank you amen for your kind attention and your love to us and you you know i i'd love to be able to shake hands with every one of you spend a few moments with you i i we don't mean to be isolationists but i hope you understand if we slip in and out brother brother ron has been instructed not to be exposed to too many people and things like that so we try to protect him as well amen but um you know sometimes we can't do enough and uh so we look to the lord of course amen matthew chapter 8 verse 23 and when he was entered into his ship his disciples followed with him or followed him and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea and so much the ship was covered with waters but he was asleep and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying lord save us we perish and he said unto them why are you fearful and oh ye of little faith and then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm but the men marveled saying what manner of man is this that even the winds and the waves obey him and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gurgaoseans there he met him to possessed with the devil coming out of the tombs exceeding fears so that no man might pass by that way then if you'll turn with me to matthew chapter 14 just a couple more chapters over verse 22 and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship to go before him unto the other side and while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went into them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway jesus spake unto them be of good cheer it is i be not afraid and peter answered him and said lord if thou if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when peter was a come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and began to sink and he cried saying lord save me and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore deadest thou doubt and when they were coming to the ship the wind ceased and then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of a truth thou art the son of god amen may god bless you as you can have your seats today i want to speak again on is there hope of revival and brother branham of course you know proclaimed the end of the azusa street and the divine healing revival and in fact i was there as a young boy when he stood in like tabernacle and and preached on the invisible union of the bride of christ and there he directed his sermon to the church the body of christ and many of them um i watched to get up and exit the building and then they actually had some meetings there with the ministry and um they were not going to let brother branham finish the meetings and they missed him at the motel and would come back a little bit uh and let him let him come and speak the next service and it was more on faith and and the healing side and they decided to let him continue the meetings but they had a little talk with him about the old times and guess you're so busy with your message you don't have time for things like the lamb and the dove and brother branham would preach that great memorial sermon on the wings of a snow white dove i remember those that meeting i was i was just a 11 year old boy i'd ask for a suit that year for my birthday and a bible with my name on it because i was getting ready to preach already and you know i did start full-time ministry at 15 and i'd look and there was windows like this except they were a little higher and someone junior jackson or someone had a dream of angels coming down through that windows and and the meetings and brother branham told about the that and i sat there listening to brother branham and watching for those angels and um you know it it those things move my childish heart and um be quite honest with you when he broke out into that last verse said i've written a verse to that and though i've suffered in many way and i cried for healing both night and day but faith wasn't forgotten by the father above he sent down a sign on the wings of a dove and you know for me that just kind of topped it all off i said wow you know he can has these visions and discerns of hearts and turns his back to the congregation and calls them out and does uh you know there's been miracles and signs and wonders and he even writes songs so you see it was just a really a wow moment for me but those things impact your life forever and but he stood there in like tabernacle and and and he spoke he said um i direct my sermon to the church the body of christ that we're trying to lead to deeper thoughts and higher objectives believing that they come to the lord is at hand and we believe that much more is 20 years closer than it was the first time i come to shreveport and of course that would have been 1946 at the beginning of the of the revival and and shortly after the angel the lord came to him that he would visit shreveport and he said so much has happened since that time now we're looking forward for the coming of the lord in our generation i'm not looking for revival in our generation i'm looking for the coming of the lord in our generation so he was not looking for another worldwide revival or another repeat of azusa or he wasn't looking for another uh divine healing movement where that there would be thousands go out then inspired by him and and uh another billy graham rise on the scene and thousands follow him with and and pattern after his ministry and others copy after brother branham and he was not looking for that he was expecting the coming of the lord and i believe that we are in the coming of the lord amen i believe that the word came to a prophet that was the coming of the lord to the a prophet not a physical coming but the word coming and i believe that that same word had to become flesh in a people that they after they ate the book they could prophesy again so i believe the lord has come and that he is his now has appeared among us in bright form and it's the same god he just changed in his mask all the time now so as we're looking at this this morning but we we're we want to speak on the subject of revival and brother branham would tell them in albuquerque in 63 right after the seals he said now you hear me then if you believe me to be a messenger sent from christ to you you believe me if if not if you're not in the kingdom of god you better press right quick it will not get better it will grow worse all the time just mark that down remember and see whether it's right or wrong you you you see if it's going to be right or wrong it's it's not going to get better it's going to get worse it's going to get harder all the time the revival is gone you're only gleaning in the field she is over and now you say i disagree with that fine it's okay if you do that's all right but that's my conviction and that's my hearing from heaven i believe the laodicean age is the pentecostal age where she comes to that place of lukewarm and god spews her from his mouth and there's where she's come right now the pentecostal movement has come to that place lukewarm not red-hot not ice cold you are not cold and you're you're not cold and formal neither are you hot you're in the spewing stage and you're going and and now of course we can all say yeah that's right i mean that's all true about the denominational system but sadly message churches are not immune to this people can get so hard and and not tender and sensitive to the spirit of god and they're lukewarm about it and brother branham even spoke of this in his own church but just before he parted in in july of 65 he said i told my wife to brother woods when i got here and some friends i met i've had about five years of hardly know what to do see the revival itself among the churches has died everyone knows that you feel it in this tabernacle so it wasn't something that was just affecting the denomination it's affecting the whole world and in every aspect he said you feel it everywhere there's a thump a dead feeling there just something isn't right it's because the revival enthusiasm has gone away from the people going to the churches you see them sitting there and the pastor is stumbling around for a message or something another and first thing you know he's turned it off to some kind of party they're going to have or something it seems to be a dead trump everywhere so you know again because of this many times the ministry as he said stumbling around for a message you know because of the lack of this of of the spirit men actually have turned to psychology to put band-aids on sin problems amen i mean we we've actually went through a whole cycle and it's still happening in many places where psychology is what is being offered and and extolled and and said that was necessary and books on dr dobson or these other christian psychologists they call them you know they are passed around because we got trouble in our churches we got problems here in the family and we got to figure a way ways to fix the problem well i'll tell you a good dose of the baptism of the holy ghost we'll fix about 99 of your marriage problems it'll fix your teenage rebellion it'll it'll fix the sin problem everywhere just get a good dose of the holy ghost but you see he said the church spirit sits spiritually dead gone the hour is past them they're in a slump hardly know what to do one running this way and one running that way and and here every promise that god made in the bible every one of them is laying there just as good as they ever was it's the hour he said what makes a church like this we're in the age of laodicea when she has to come this way but praise god i read in the in that same chapter there about the lukewarm spirit and it says to him that overcomes well he couldn't say to him that overcometh unless there's somebody going to overcome [Applause] amen now so again god likes to show his power he likes to do that it pleases him to show his omnipotence to let his subjects know who he is amen and what does that do it it prepares their hearts it makes them ready it makes them brace up and take a new hold and he said to people who don't believe in divine healing and performing in miracles i wonder i know wonder our churches are dying no wonder they're withered up to bloodless cults and it's sad today you know many that are calling herself or i have identified to them as a as a message of people they're they're just nothing more than a cult if you don't belong to them you can't fellowship you can't enter you can't there's all kinds of awful things that are happening in the midst and i mean marriages and divorces and remarriages and and fixed marriages and every kind of problem that you can you can imagine and many times you know the message is no longer being even preached but you see god is a great phenomenal he's a creator he and he is jehovah he's the great reality he's a great substance of everything that was made on the earth everything was made by him he'll display his power by the sun rising every morning by sending forth his reign and by setting his rainbows in the sky and he comes down to his subjects and he heals our sickness saves us from our sins god likes to display the phenomenal and speaking of the other church early church brother branham said notice if it's a church that when they obeyed what god said originally and it is the word of god look at the miracles and the signs and so forth they had and they and you don't have them at all today it's an evidence that god is not with you and and so signs will follow them that believe amen because he said that they will be casting out devils they will believe in healing they will be speaking with new tongues they will believe all the supernatural works of god the resurrected jesus working among them amen to try to take that away you will be cursed amen and what the you know and so brother brandon said that's just the way it is you try to add to it you try to take from it you'll be cursed try to take that out of the church you're a cursed people amen he said was the pentecostal church and noisy church back in the beginning when the holy ghost first fell the virgin mary like she was drunk staggering under the power of god and all of them like that and people said they're full of new wine that's the way the church was ordained that's the way every church is ordained every time god has a church he'll have that kind of church you know it even got taught among us you know actually it actually got taught among us said oh we get the holy ghost like mary did you know um you know when mary when mary got it she got it without sensation and and and she conceived there and it was of the holy ghost that was not when she got the holy ghost that's when she got pregnant [Applause] when she got the holy ghost she was in the upper room she staggered like a drunk woman she spoke in other tongues like the rest of them amen and brother adam said if you don't get the holy ghost like mary did he said you're not going to enter in he said if god wouldn't let her into heaven without that kind of pentecostal experience he's not going to let you into heaven [Applause] so that's a lie that's not how we receive the holy ghost not not even a teaching of the message that was a teaching of a backslidden preacher now you see in the second hand ruby said they say divine healing can't work the days of miracles has passed he says if the days and miracles has passed the days of god is past the church that don't believe in the supernatural will finally die and god will leave that church so again we we ask is there possibility is there any possibility that there could be somebody on fire for god in this last day is there a possibility that someone would be hot i'm not worried about the coldness my goodness the whole world is is either lukewarm or cold but is there going to be somebody hot is there going to be somebody fervent is there somebody going to be full of the power of god is there hope for revival that's my question today [Music] brother branham said it seems like a drying out of the churches and i hardly can find a church anywhere that's alive with the word and with the spirit of god and great things taking place like it was not long ago god of this evil age listen to this this is august just before he leaves us he says now she's she has caused the whole world except the scientific leadership of the educational program that satan has given to her under the name of a church the leadership of an educational scientific program i'm preaching to you the god of this world when she has eve had the very feeling of god's word in her hand she could have taken god's word but what should she do to that instead of carrying for the baptism of the holy ghost let science prove to her that the holy ghost was only for the disciples and instead of keeping divine healing going when she ought to be now raising the dead and doing great miracles she has let satan under his leadership of religious man take the word of god and try to say it was for another age now you see that's the condition and that's what brother branham said instead of keeping it going you see we were never to let the holy spirit die out in our church and the phenomenon to quit amen there ought to be a holy power surrounding the church that makes demons flee where sin is uncomfortable in our midst where is called out and exposed it can't be hidden anymore and there's an anonymized sapphire but brother adam said instead of that we become a laughingstock he said what is it mechanics instead of dynamics i'm quoting him he said then they have the nerve to say wonder what happened the god of the bible where is that god he said well you choked him out by your creeds creates this doctrinal statement so you know i believe that's what creed means i believe this is what we believe and and so creeds in one sense created the creeds are wrong we all have creeds no creed but christ no book but the bible so you see christ should be our creed what we believe amen but he said you try to place him back in history and this is happened we sometimes point way back what god used to do how he worked and threw a prophet and how he vindicated the message and said we we don't need vindication anymore well the new testament church needed vindication these signs have followed them that believe and the lord went with them working signs and wonders among them and this was the proof that the lord was with them silver and gold have thy none they knew they had been with jesus you see they had vindication well the message don't need vindication no but you as a believer needs vindication god has vindicated and proved the message but you see he must show himself alive with us over and over and over again well i don't need a miracle i do well i'll tell you we we don't need healing we we we got doctors no we need divine healing amen now he's still god the god of history but he's waiting for somebody to call him up out of history god remains the same he's forever god and so he says and when we begin to find out miracles isn't taking place no more like they were the sick go home sick it isn't because of god it's because of the lack of revival among the people there's no revival they just sit and listen and go home and say well i guess that was pretty good and see there's not that zeal there's not that something in the people that should be there now brother branham often talked about two classes of people he said if i could just get these two together and he said one is fundamental you know and he said the other of course he said where the pentecostal in other words he said if i could just get them together he said in my travel once a fundamental they know by the mechanics positionally they know by the mechanics they are to be sons and daughters of god you know i spoke to a man that was so mechanically sure of his salvation as a baptist man he sat there with me and was talking to me about a situation that he was contemplating and he said now i'm not here to talk about my salvation i am saved i know i'm going to heaven i know without a doubt i'm going to be there i'm secure you know i've accepted jesus as my savior and i know beyond a shadow doubt i'll be in that rapture as he sucked his cigarette lit another one off of that one and sucked another and then he was contemplating marrying for the third time and then he then he had just been arrested for drunk driving just two weeks before and spent a few nights in jail but he was so sure he had the mechanics so down of the positioning i'm a son of god but he had no dynamics he had no life to go with it amen and he said that the next i financed the pentecostals day they were the baptism of the holy spirit not many times this baptism was just was rarely on the soul just from the flesh of screaming and shouting and worked up emotion now we know that everywhere jesus is there's noise but there can be noise and jesus ain't nowhere [Music] so it ain't just noise that we're trying to get revival isn't just noise i want to get some thoughts to you we get noise confused with the anointing noise ain't the anointing and brother brandon said i've seen a lot of noise and not enough faith to cure a toothache you you know you've got to come solemnly to the father you know with with with assurance you know who you are but he said i've seen people shout and praise the lord not enough faith to heal a toothache and actually actually we've had a fraction of the message that have trained their their congregation to give a response of running down to the platform standing there shouting and screaming to the preaching noise that has been sometimes confused even for the evidence of the holy ghost you know and much of it is no different from the priest of baal who elijah mocked as they tried to scream down the power of their god but you see the evidence of the token is not noise it is a surrendered life to god so he said brother the whole old floor was dancing the spirit and he said not enough faith to heal the truth you call that power that's not power that's blessings and there's a lot of difference between blessings and power amen god baits his blessings on the righteous and the unrighteous amen but he said we need to get back to the truth but i'm just going to say on the other hand just theology don't work either come on just drop theology don't do it either we've seen people so pumped with theology they ain't enough faith to heal a toothache [Applause] paul saw it coming he wander he warned about a subtle priesthood that would come and take over with false doctrines and he knew they would implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part of the holy spirit ministry and he said and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there's not too much freedom in the laity and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it this is a far cry from paul who said when all came together all had the leading of the spirit and all participated in spiritual worship so we have we have two groups of fundamentals oh my word word word and and then the pentecostals spirit spirit spirit and of course you know there has to be a third one more group that has it all together [Applause] brother branham long to see it if i could just get these two together that's what his message was to produce fundamentals they know positioning where they're at but they don't have any faith pentecostals got a lot of faith and don't know who they are he says like one having money in the bank the other and don't know how to write a check and the other knows how to write a check but he has no money in the bank if we could get them together amen i believe god's going to have it together he said his bride would be without spot or wrinkle amen and he said to pentecost if they could take that stream and know how to direct it fundamentally in the word the big regime of god would start moving on and he said that's where satan's got in to make it all mechanics and no dynamics or all dynamics and no mechanics we've got to put it together we've got to have the power of the holy spirit but we've got to come back with the word to feed this machine we can't feed it on creed it won't burn it it chokes up the flues it will not burn it it was made for the word of god man shall not live by bread alone but by every word not as part of it so brother branham accessed the condition of the day and he spoke of it like two cars one mechanically fine and that it had all the looks and the shine you know it had all of the beautiful plush seats and doe skin and and diamond studded steering wheel and polished hubs and and he says what good does it do he called it give it a simonized job you know that's a polishing job and he said what good does it do to polish it all up it don't run and that's what happens a lot of times is our religious ways have just become polished up but it don't run as i said yesterday it won't run down to divine healing it won't run to the power of god it won't drive down to miracles it won't it won't drive down to holy lives it sits right there and it won't go anywhere it looks like a church but it isn't with the power of god in it now and he said that he said until the church becomes both dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of god that moved him to do the same things he did if he did on 16 cylinders so will the bride for he said in john 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also i'll give him a charge of my dynamics in his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it and i'll raise him up again in the last day that's the easter message the dynamics and the mechanics together the mechanics without dynamics no good and neither is dynamics without the mechanics he said you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny this word it won't do any good you're just cranking around on the on the pistons you know god got the you got to have the spark there to fire you got the spark there to fire but no gasoline to fire it by it'll only work when it comes together amen one will sit still he said and the other will go up i don't know about you but i don't want to be left here sitting still i want to go up i want to be a part of that rapture the car that the brother branham left running it'll drive to the rapture [Applause] but it'll only work if the two come together amen and of course he says it won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics come and when the dynamics come that fire that's made to connect with that octane in the gasoline when that explodes it causes a combustion [Applause] hallelujah i want to say there's power in the word there's power in the message it's full of not just 98 of octane it's full of the power of god hallelujah there's liftoff power in it there's rapture and faith in it are you with me it all leaves right there in the word but it takes the holy spirit dynamics to make that word live so there are two drops of brother bradham in her will back and forth there again at the end of his ministry he would preach a lot on you know about waking up samson we spoke about that yesterday and there are to now our day before now but they're they're true thoughts that brother branham enter whoa back and forth and one thought was contained in the testimony on the sea go awake jesus and the others dealt with where the disciples um were in in that he dealt with the disciples had jesus in the boat jesus was asleep in their boat and they were testifying of all the great things that god had done and the other one be not afraid he was telling us there's some that has actually went without jesus so you wind up with two fractions one has jesus but he's asleep the other has went off without him they started the journey and didn't take jesus with them and so now they get along life's journey and what happened they get in the storms because you're going to get in the storms whether jesus with you or not you're going to have storms in your life are you with me now so their true thoughts go await jesus and be not afraid and they revealed two conditions of the end-time people a person or a church who has jesus in their boat but just needs to arouse him niece arousing the only thing that will arouse him is your faith amen or a person or church who has gone off without jesus and he's the very thing they need but they're afraid of it so some have him but he needs to be awakened and some don't don't have him at all and they're afraid of it you see they're afraid to speak with tongues believers shouldn't be afraid of that in my name they'll cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues is that right then they're afraid of the anointing because it might be an anointed one says end time well you better be well i don't want to be on the one of them anointed once at the end time you better be the anointing was never sent for the terror the rain did not come for the weeds the rain came from the for the wheat [Applause] it just happened to fall on the just and the unjust it wasn't sent for them it was sent for you we the bride must be the anointed one of the day in fact that's why the mighty angel came that was not a physical return of christ that was an anointing coming down and that anointing would open the seals it would reveal the mysteries and once you ate it oh hallelujah it would cause something to burst on the inside of you until you also gave witness hallelujah hallelujah so you better be the anointed ones at the end time amen it's that anointing that rain that is sent to mature the wheat to make them rejoice brother branham preached another sermon just before he left and it was called ashamed of him and he warned us about being ashamed of christ because there's a whole age that is rejecting him and he said when it comes to accepting the fatherhood of the word of god christ no they're embarrassed they don't want to say yes i have spoke with tongues yes i had seen visions yes i believe in divine healing yes i praise the lord [Applause] amen you know you know some get embarrassed because brother ron said i saw a vision only brother branham could do that you're god's in the past come on joel 2 said in the last day i'll pour out my spirit on sons and daughters old men will dream dreams and young men will see visions and i'll pour it up on handmaids and daughters upon all flesh and if you see them out there doing it what are the bread of christ if they can rejoice over their anointing what about us who's anointed with the mighty angel [Applause] and ashamed of him he said but let me say this a man who has once come in contact with god which is the word and the word has been plain and manifested to him there's no shameness about that you are not embarrassed it doesn't embarrass me to say i believe every word of god it doesn't embarrass me when the lord says to do anything you go and say and do it it don't embarrass me to say i've been filled with the holy ghost it don't embarrass me to say i've spoke with other tongues it doesn't embarrass me to say that our lord showed me vision it don't embarrass me to say he's the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] now the disciples they got out on this ship and jesus went to sleep the divine healing revival had just kind of went over they'd had great revivals and miracles and you know those testimonies in india those testimonies of blind men in africa or the blind man in mexico the dead baby that came to life or the little crippled upper character you know that was there with with a chain around his neck and seemed straightened up and bones cracking becoming a wrecked man and healed amen great revivals they had seen marvelous things when they got out there on the sea and they got out there kind of resting relaxing and in their relaxing time jesus went to sleep and they were resting between revivals brother them why are you preaching this because the resting between revivals cannot go on forever it's time we start stressing the dynamics and that's why i am announcing the rest between revivals is over [Music] amen the pride is starting to realize they are the revival we've had a good time of coasting along and going over the mysteries and talking about the seals and and looking at all the mechanics and tinkering with this and t and some of tinker waited till they wanted to run no more they pulled out the plugs and set them at a different gap and made two lords out of them and and it just sputters and won't go and it won't get out of the driveway and sometimes well we'll just wait for brother branham to come back when he comes back he'll fix it it's going to be too late when brother branham comes back you're going to have to have the dynamics to be changed come on you're going to have to have the holy ghost moving in your life or you're going to miss it so the rest between revivals is over we've had 60 years of that [Applause] it's going home time it's rapture time we've started out on a journey with a great divine healing revival that crescendoed and think about it he kept crescendoing and crescendoing and it reached an apex until you know the revelations of god went from just discerning the thoughts and intense heart to revealing the word are you with me amen that same god that could go back 40 years in a person's life could go back and show you where in the mind of god before the foundation of the world is that right i mean this was more important that word where your problem began it could go back to genesis and see the fall this was more important than finding out 40 years ago you were scared by a dog this is where the church got off and sin entered in right back out here in genesis in the beginning and thrilled that beast all the way to the end to where the devil has been totally exposed [Applause] the man of sin has been exposed the mystery of iniquity that worked back in paul's day now we see it clearly now amen it crescendoed into the book being opened by the lamb and the seals being opened to where we are standing here today in the in the very coming of the lord that seventh seal being opened that had broken the silence what god held secret to other ages has now been made known is not silenced anymore it's been revealed you are privy to things that other agents didn't get to know if satan would have got a hold of it that there would be seven ages and seven messengers in 2000 years he'd have done great damage with that so god hid all of that until the last day [Applause] you see we've been on a journey and it's kind of like this you know uh we we've been on a journey and you got to know where you're at and god wanted you to know where you're at [Applause] he wanted you to know you're the last stage there's not another age coming this is the last message and if you miss it you're going to miss it don't miss this junction [Applause] amen so you know it's kind of like one day i went on a journey i had a friend a brother in the church you know he was from florida and made many trips down there his dad passed away and they wanted me to do the memorial service so i got in my car and i took him with me and his sister and and down to florida we go before i leave on the journey i just happen to remember i forgot my map i said and that was days you know no gps in and so i forgot my map and so i said wait wait wait wait i said i can't go nowhere till i get my map and and he said to me ah you don't need that old map he said i know the way like the back of my hand i have been to florida so many times i can tell you exactly every time i said you know how to get to florida i don't know how to get to florida you don't need a map but i need a map buddy so i went back in and i got my map and i looked and i charted out my journey okay you make this turn this turn this turn and and i kind of got it down in my mind and we could refer to my map anytime i needed to and we start along the journey and about two in the morning it's about 16 hour drive there and about two in the morning i got real tired and i said hey would you drive for an hour uh and he said yeah he said i'll let you rest for an hour he said i'd be glad to i said okay i'm gonna go to sleep now there's a turn down here you want to watch listen you can go to sleep i've been this way many many times so i go to sleep and i'm sleeping maybe 30 40 minutes and all of a sudden i feel the vehicle come to stop and i raise up and i look around and he's i said where are we he said i don't know the road just disappeared i said roads just can't disappear i said where are we at he said i don't know look on that map and tell us where we're at i said math don't work that way i can't look at this map and tell you where we're at i said but since you got us lost you see that store right there walk in there and ask this question where am i and if you can tell me where we are i can look on this map and get us back on the right road to florida you're getting adrift that's what god did in this day we had a road map but we didn't know where we were and so god sent a seer a prophet that opened the map and said right here's where you're at you're in the last age during the last days little children it's rapture time hallelujah now we can use the road map to go all the way you know why because that seer marked it out clearly the path all the way to the don't get off the path stay with the message so you know we have spent 50 60 years since we have discovered where we're at in time that we as a church have journeyed now we can look back on the map say we started back here on the day of pentecost and we come down through here ephesus and smyrna and i that that sign post was that signpost right there that was uh paul and and here here it was and we can trace it right on down through seven ages and we have now come to the last one now as we're sailing along in the boat and you know resting between revivals you don't get a little relaxing time and we're not only testifying about what god did but then we start talking about the doctrines of jesus and somehow we begin to hear things in views that are expressed in the boat uh that pentecost is not our goal is not our destination it's not where we're supposed to be that you know that somehow another you know before jesus went to sleep in our boat he taught the and all believers used to believe that malachi 4 was to turn our hearts back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers but now many are not sure that they're even to be like the original church well i wanted to say god had a church like he wanted and now he wants a church like he started [Applause] but somehow the thought is we're to end up somewhere different than what was poured out at pentecost and winds that begin to howl and the devil gets into those winds and you know there's no such thing as miracles you know just quieting down your testimony boys you know women don't you say amen no more i mean you know come on yeah there's nothing to be excited about this is a boat trip god don't do miracles anymore but even the devil that gets in the storm knows assuredly that the original church at pentecost with the power of god mark 16 in action is the true church that jesus claims is his own and all else is false it has to be he said christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts [Applause] amen so you know we're not just returning to the book of acts we are continuing where they failed we have went back there and we're going to finish the race [Applause] now the seven ages were represented by seven lamps the holy fire from the altar being passed from lamb to lamp is a type of the holy spirit in the seven church ages that original outpouring of the holy of the holy ghost at pentecost which came direct from jesus on the mercy seat is enduring is endowing his church um through this all seven ages showing he's the same yesterday today and forever so what happened god lit the first one the light from there lights the next the light from there lights the next all the way down to the end showing jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever but somehow we've been told now there we got something different than they what they had in acts 2. indeed many have us it's true it don't match the original outpouring at all and whatever this snake oil is that they're trying to burn the fire god won't stay lit on it you see what the church was at pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern but somehow we're winding up with something different we don't want to be those acts 2 38 screaming blabbering shouting amen who have the second adam's way of acting we don't want children like that so then where the church becomes like those women screaming down there about roe versus wade we want to kill those because we don't want that kind of noise in our church so we'll abort those noisy kids but we don't have time for that in our society church after all is our body it's our church well your womb must have been for the holy spirit to bear forth his life in case women have forgotten that's what a womb is for that's what marriage is all about to reproduce that life again and why does god want a womb in this last day he wants to reproduce his life he wants to put his spirit into a body and he wants that seed of his own seed he don't want any of every top dick and harry out here he wants it out of his own life [Applause] but we're told to expect different results and if and if the original root at pentecost was an orange tree how come we got bitter lemons as fruit it isn't long that in this boat you know these oars these precious truths that we were to push the boat along with and wound up as weapons against one another you don't think that's end time prophecy part the end time prophecy is they waited on the master's return they began to beat one another that's part of the coming that's part of what will happen in the end time amen and so you know instead of using it there to further the gospel we'll use it to beat one another with am i but i wouldn't say scripture doesn't fight scripture and quotes don't fight quotes amen and if we're going to say well the word has been restored well then take all of it every bit of it amen i want every bit of it if there's tongues in it i want it if there's healing in it i want it if there's shouting in it i want it amen if there's a christian stable life in it i want it whatever it has i want it [Applause] so the true church will always try to be like the original of pentecost the true church today will try to approximate the early first one the messengers through the churches having the same spirit of god in them will try to approximate the apostle paul they won't be exactly like him but the true messengers will be the ones that come closest to paul who was free of all men sold out to god gave forth the word of god only manifested the holy ghost in power not none else would do you gotta work from the original as the light begins life the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of her founders at pentecost and her messengers will follow the apostle paul the first messenger to the first stage is that simple and that wonderful but in case you noticed around it's getting dark out here on this boat you know the skies are friendly waves are coming up trouble's on every hand wars and political strife the climate isn't real good for us on this journey amen i mean there's every kind of things that that where where the left has their agenda and we're going to have our liberal world order what sure they're going to say crown satan we're we're we are in a transition where there's a bride ascending and satan being cast out and one day he'll be full king of the earth but thank god we won't be here but right now we're already feeling the winds of persecution we're feeling the winds the winds and the storms of judgment we're feeling the heat of the tribulation already pre-tribulation plagues are coming up on the earth [Applause] you can't even send your kids to school without them coming out contaminated two-fold more child of hell when they come out than what they were when they went in it's a troubled world that we're in [Applause] and satan's got an agenda now john you know before all this tempus got up real big you know he began maybe it started with him a testimony brother brandon said his heart wasn't so scarred with so much theology and he must have said think of it right in this ship this one that's identified by jehovah's word to be jehovah's servant and whom he is pleased is right here in the ship with us you know you get your heart all scarred with theology preacher friend of mine just wrote me this morning i just listened to brother donnie preaching scarred human beings it's uh it's a sermon that's just this has just been so profound but let me tell you a lot of people are scarred with theology they've been scarred by preachers they've been scarred by doctrines they've been scarred by attitudes of church members they've been scarred you know by theology you know well we got the thunders right we we are the seals i mean we're the opening of the word we and they don't live but they're open in the word we're we is coming we're the epiphany we are the perusia and well you know it's it doesn't say and after a while you get so out of focus there ain't even one lord in focus anymore there's two laying in your ship how'd there get to be two jehovah's and two jesuses and two lords and amen but your heart but but when your heart isn't scarred so scarred instead of thinking oh i'm so glad of this certain theology man i'm in the bride and man us click our four no more when your heart isn't really scarred you're just thankful for his life and power within you [Music] because not to know his theology is life not to know even the bible is like but to know him as life to know him as your savior the one who's filled you with his holy spirit you were there when it happened and nobody can take that away from you you see that's what smith wigglesworth said years ago he said he that hath an experience is not merely it is not at the mercies of those who merely have an argument and i tell you if you don't get the holy ghost somebody will out argue you somewhere and talk you out of the message and discredit the messenger and it's done that to many but if you got an anchor [Applause] if you got an experience you may not be able to explain every bit of that and i understand all of that and how come that how come that jesus called that woman a dog and how come that he he did this and ate with sinners and how come he was how why did he do that you may not be able to understand but you know this i met him and he changed my life [Applause] [Music] some people say leave the message brother tim leave the message leave the message i said well give me something better show me something better if i'm going to leave this i wouldn't leave it for something unless it's better you know what you got look at your kids look at the drinking habits coming back the smoking the doping the anti-god look what it's doing to your family look how it's taking away holiness and look how the fornication and adultery is coming look at your lives [Applause] hey man like brother brother ron told one that left his church said you know take a picture now what you are because down here it's going to be a different picture [Applause] and them same ones you know that left for something better now tattoos on their fingers on their hands what are they tattooing well done so because i have to tattoo it here because i'll never hear it there but you know god called ministers ought not be so stuffed with theology don't look to psychology on how to fix problems preach the holy ghost in power that affects every marriage problem that affects your home life that affects your children a good old-fashioned prayer meeting amen we'll fix the argument in your home hey man it'll soften down the woman and make her subject to her husband it'll better leadership in the man and make him a godly leader are you with me i remember psychology will never do that it'll put a band-aid on your problem but it won't fix the problem because it's sin nature that's got to be dealt with brother branham said preachers ought not be so stiff with theology but have visited the land of where we're going bringing back evidence of divine love and the power of jesus christ to make known to their congregation there's a land beyond the river hallelujah but you know they felt pretty secure and you can feel very secure knowing jesus is in your boat that you know whatever we're doing is we're driving along life's ways going down the highways jesus lays in the ship you know he's in our little boat is which we're so assailing life's solemn maine and just think of it it's comforting to know he said i'll never leave you or forsake you amen it's comforting to know that we're sealed to the day of redemption not just to the next revival we're sealed even when there isn't revival even when we don't feel joy even when the meeting's over with and we've gone home and back to the regular routine we know he's with us but you see when trouble set in they forgot all about it you know but yet he was still as great as he ever was he was the one who created the sea he was the one who created the wind he created the world he was able to park the red sea goodness what could he do with water amen he could heal the leper give sight to the blind he was great as he was anytime he's still just as great he's still just as great as what he was in the divine healing movement he's still just as great as he was in the prophet come on church amen and but you know as i said you as you're going along the winds begin to blow and trouble comes in you know then we find little fusses come up in the church you know churches have been split over having a sidewalk built to the bathroom or the well y'all call it here washroom we wash clothes in a washroom [Applause] but anyway you know and churches split over that had church split over the most frivolous things most silliest things especially you get in the building project or our expansion and watch the arguments fly and then the next thing you know hey you know i mean nothing's going right you know that'll destroy the church so well our pastor pray for him have an all-night revival meeting call on god he can change the situation he'll either move in him or move him out amen oh if we can just catch the vision god hasn't left us amen he's the great the great almighty jehovah the holy ghost in spirit form is in you amen jesus said that day you will know that i am in the father the father in me and i and you that all that god was he poured into jesus and all that jesus was he pours into the church he divided himself on the day of pentecost the pillar of fire came down amen and busted itself up and this kind of glory put in different ones tongues of fire seen on each one of them the holy spirit god identified himself as human beings do you believe that each one of you with the holy ghost has a portion of deity within you amen and that person is omnipotent there's no big heavy spots in god and little weak spots in god the very little smallest touch of god is omnipotent there's omnipotent power laying within your life and in this church but some just need to wake jesus he's there but you just let him go to sleep in your life and others don't have jesus to wake up some individuals some people some churches have went off without him [Music] and there's two kinds some have him he went sleep and some have him or don't have him they went on the journey can you imagine going on a journey without jesus you know and and so they don't have jesus to wake up but i just want to say to you you were you without jesus this morning and churches without jesus and even preachers without jesus i just want to say this that even in that troublesome times those without jesus was not all lost [Applause] jesus suddenly appeared on those troubled waters [Applause] and he invited peter and them to walk on those troubled waters [Applause] hallelujah can you imagine that people even that went off without jesus he comes because he ain't gonna lose one of his he's been watching you all alone amen he's been seeing you from the distance and he knows you're about to capsize he knows you're about to go down but here he comes walking on your troubled waters i can speak in tongues right now hallelujah he comes walking on your troubled waters [Applause] just take a step toward him come on peter amen lord if it's you bid me come that's what he's doing come on come on i'll make you walk on that i'll make you walk over that vaping i'll make you walk over that cigarette i'll make you walk over those drugs i'll make you walk on top of that porn i'll make you walk over that habit cut on somebody i'll make you i'll be and you'll be able to put your fat down on any promise and the devil will be under your feet and you'll walk on stormy waters [Applause] god invites you to experience the miraculous [Applause] even those that went without him he's inviting you to experience some miraculous you can walk on your waters [Applause] there's a devil in that sea yeah there is but you can walk on him [Music] if he's not under your feet like brother timothy said he's out of his place [Applause] he invites you to experience miraculous so what i might stumble what peter did he made a few steps there and then he got troubled by all the waters oh no you know i i i heard him say bid come and now what am i going to do my girlfriend will leave me my my my this will happen and how am i going to handle this situation and oh my goodness these waves are tile taller than these i'll surely drown out here uh you know and the moment you do you'll start seeking the moment you begin to look at your circumstances some of you have been invited to walk over your sickness and then you'll see those circumstances and say i can't do this but jesus said come and he never asked you to come unless he gives you the ability come on church peter didn't have the ability to walk on the water jesus gave him that ability you can't overcome that sickness you can't overcome that sin but jesus will give you the ability to overcome that sin i'm preaching to somebody [Applause] hallelujah oh but oh brother tim i i'll tell you that happened yesterday and i'm already sinking we'll quit your eyes off of that and look on jesus again and say lord help me i perish and guess what peter wasn't a man who just walked on the water once he walked on the water twice come on somebody he walked on the water twice listen my god's a god of second chances third chances four chances fifth chances six chances seven chances he'll never give up he will not be defeated and if you walk the water once you can walk on water twice but whatever you do just keep walking until you get jesus in your boat [Applause] you don't have to drown out there you don't have to wallow himself pity you don't have to say this is dirty you know you don't have to go into suicide you can invite jesus in your boat walk on your water toward him till you and him gets in the boat together and you know what happens then the storm pharmacies [Applause] jesus will lift you up and make you to walk on water again and come to your ship and then you'll have jesus in your boat and with jesus in your boat you can crest any storm you can go through any troubled water you can go through any problem in life it will save you when you're dying it will heal you it will deliver you it'll do everything when jesus is in your boat hallelujah [Applause] there there was their boat on the other hand was about to sink and somebody finally remembered that the one they'd been ignoring too busy with theology too busy with churchianity too very busy just going through the motion of things too busy with life and the one they had been ignoring was asleep and somebody said we better wake jesus up these waves we ain't gonna make it if jesus don't come to wake in our lives we're never gonna make it we've got to get to the other side amen so it dawned on somebody you know that the one who had been resting between the revivals the one that left go to sleep because emphasis was put on other things oh they were still talking about jesus they were still discussing the quotes they were even slapping one another with oars and say you big dummy you know i've got more revelation than you and you know i was the first to meet jesus and i was the first to recognize him and i'm number one preacher in the message all that may be okay until storm comes [Applause] but when the storm comes you're going to need jesus [Music] all of a sudden two lords ain't so important i better know the lord all of a sudden an emotionless religion kind of gets emotional [Applause] i need jesus when you begin to realize your need that he's got to be brought back to forefront that he's got to be number one in your life that he can't just be resting between revival and we're fussing and stewing and worried and tore up and doubting while the creator is laying in our boat listen the very god let it dawn on us today that lay you know that this dawning just come that the very god that separated you from your mother that gave you the holy ghost that he's just as much god right now [Applause] in your storm you say brother tim i'm so disappointed how life is turned out i'm disappointed with with people i'm disappointed with churches you get so disappointed you don't even come to church no more amen you're so disappointed you won't even do what the bible says no more you don't assemble yourself with other believers well ain't nobody believes like i do you don't throw yours away they're too broke up and beat up whittle down till it won't push the boat toward the promise well i'll tell you what i got enough of god in me i don't need wins tonight i got enough holy ghost i'll tell you i got enough of him i i don't need a refilling these preachers preaching about a wreath and i don't need it i am self-secured i tell you i got him many years ago when i got him i'll tell you what my experience it helps me and i'm i'm here to this day and you know i don't need nothing laodicea god i don't need you no more but when the storm gets up and it's not going to get any better it's fixing to get worse you think you've seen the wave of sin it ain't nothing yet but it began to dawn them you know that and brother branham said maybe and he he had come to the end of the divine healing movement and listen to his words maybe between the revivals now and we are looking for another stir where there's got to be have something happen that will gather the church together amen you know this revival it will crescendo in the dead in christ rising and us being changed to meet the lord in the air now now look we've got to get there [Applause] we've got to get to the other side there's things that's got to happen you see on the other side there was a legions there was legions waiting for deliverance and and you see the legion that had been he was so overtaken by by sin and chains and they you know all kinds of things that he was among the tombs are you with me and they're legionary he he he was among the tombs dead things and jesus went to deliver a man who was among the tombs because one moment just in one moment when he was there at his worst just for a brief second he came to himself enough to whisper a prayer god help me and it just so happened that the god he was praying to was across the sea way over there out of what they thought was hearing but you see god's never out of hearing he hears even allegiance prayer that little whisper from the worst center saying god help me [Applause] maybe it was just whispered that morning in the tomb and jesus left the other meetings why he had come all the way from heaven come on somebody he had not just left the meeting he had come all the way from heaven to find legion hallelujah thank you jesus thank you jesus he'll come all the way from glory this morning he'll orchestrate one meeting he'll then still have the entire meeting for what legion for one person from one sinner [Applause] he's a god who cares [Applause] he cares for you he cares about your sickness he was wounded for your transgressions he was bruised because of your iniquity the weapons you should have taken he took them for you and by those stripes you are delivered delivered thank you on the other side on the other side of this storm on the other side of this awakening on this other side of awakening jesus there was there was those who were going to be touched but jesus had to be awakened in the boat before they could be delivered they were on the way to deliverance of men who had been among the tombs broken men shattered helpless lives oh my what do i hear around the message i hear sounds of children of little kids with autism laying there afflicted for years and years little more than mindless vegetables and exhausted parents i hear of husbands that are drunks smothered over memories of a horrible childhood where he watched murders happen or awful things happen to him i hear of children suffering with demonic oppression with intense sadness until they wish to die i hear of mothers crying for their children that were raised in the message but now they're bound with alcohol and drugs in unimaginable sense no wonder can they be it's awful for you to build hope for them no there is hope so there is no hope i'm not trying to give anybody hope i'm preaching faith i am preaching faith because the legion the bound the affliction the blind the death the dumb the cancer stricken the sick are waiting for us to realize that jesus is in our ship [Applause] [Music] don't you know brother tim there's no hope for them yeah i know they're hopeless mentally you know medical science can do nothing for them drug rehab cannot help them a.a can't help them amen cancer treatments can't help them can't cure the problem but oh god loved us so much he brought us out of sin amen what's the matter us why would we be spineless enough that we can't believe that he would deliver us from our afflictions we got to change our thinking we got to realize that jesus is in our ship that same one that healed the sick and open the eyes of the blind that same one that restored our hearing to the death that healed cancer that same god that got a hold of women that came to brother branson's meetings that were hopeless alcoholics prostitutes and god changed them into witnesses for the kingdom of god [Applause] [Music] hallelujah that same god is still god [Applause] i know he's still god i've seen what he does i've seen him open the eyes of the blind amen i've seen cripples walk [Applause] eight years ago when my wife had her first brain bleed she was laying there in the bed after that she couldn't see the peripheral vision was gone she had limited eyesight she's laying there wondering about her future she's wondering how it was going to be not to be able to see and not be able to drive it was in a horrible condition that's okay it's raining outside gonna be raining in here before it's over let it rain let it rain [Music] [Applause] [Music] let me just tell you my wife laying there in that condition we had an 18 month old child in the home at that time michael and bethany my daughter and son-in-law were living with us little drew had been born and he was unable to walk or crawl couldn't he pull up at 18 months old he could we could put him in his little hands there and he just taught her couldn't take a step doctors said he had an underdeveloped hip he was talking about operations earlier before that at our family camp bethany had come to the prayer line leaving her baby there in the in a room with a baby monitor to listen out for it and came through the prayer line brother ron stopped her and said where's your baby i said i just saw him in a vision walking he brought him had prayer for him nothing happened right then now that was about a year old and now it was now it was um later in the year he's 18 months old he still don't crawl can't pull up barely sits alone weak in his body unable to crawl or stand alone bethany comes in that morning and she sets little drew at the end of her mother's bed and her mother had been sitting there kind of in despair feeling sorry for herself and then she began to remember but i got jesus in this ship [Applause] [Music] and she began to think with him and his ship all things are possible and i don't have to fear about the future i know god's a healer and she just lifted her hand to begin to praise him and she did her sight came back and the holy spirit moved over that bed to that baby sitting in the middle of the floor and he jumped up by himself out of the middle of the floor and ran all over our house you know why because she realized we got jesus in that ship and with jesus in our ship he'll cure cancer he'll heal diseases amen he'll take care of your problem he's there for you and your family he's there for your children he's there for your grandchildren he's there for your wife he's there for you young people he's there for you old people god has never forgotten you [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah what am i trying to do get your mind back on what we got amen you say well brother tim you're just trying to give somebody hope well abraham against hope he believed in hope and when hope was against him and there was no longer any reason to hope for all hope was gone he believed anyway so even if i'm trying to get you to hope i'm certainly trying to get you to believe in hope believe in that hope now but it's not going to do any good until you start believing it come on amen so therefore i'm trying to stir up the gift of god that's in your life amen but remember we're between revivals that's what we've been but we're right here on the edge where there's an awakening going on somebody's awakening jesus i'm trying to stir up the gift in your life this morning amen and brother branham said in the message token i'm looking for a time of break forth of the spirit of god in these last days that we're now living in for another surge of the holy spirit into the church for a rapture and faith just before it comes and everything is sitting straight in order for that and i believe we're at the time that the word should have preeminence amen hallelujah he said the church is ready she's sealed in ready to come there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab that church and take her into the skies exactly because see the church the word the bride and christ the ministry is in his bride which is body the supernatural spiritual body of his on the earth right now hallelujah his last sermon he left these words in the message communion you know the hour will soon arise when right among us the holy spirit will speak out like it did in anonymized sapphire remember that hour is arriving now you just remember that that god is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now amen another shaken brother branham talked about it another shaken what is it we've got to shake jesus within us bring him to the front theology ain't going to help you you tried the oars the rigging the sails have been all broke apart all your arguments on on message theology breaks all apart and storms amen we need jesus hallelujah brother branham said there's still room even for more at the table he said god's going to send another shaking across the country because there's somebody still out there it might be your child it might be your grandchild it might be your husband your wife but there's a seed out there somewhere probably tim you've been preaching to come to the lord for years yeah there's been many laid right in front of here that i pray that the lord came for but he's still coming he'll come for you he might come for you today you don't know when he's coming amen in the signs of a believing church there will be miracles signs of a believing church there will be healing there will be a genuine atmosphere of the holy ghost oh we don't love the atmosphere the holy ghost brother damn we want something that will mature as well guess what matures you if the holy ghost don't do it i don't want that maturity [Music] [Applause] there will be gifts of the spirit in that church there will be genuine christians living and overcoming life in that church [Applause] [Music] hallelujah oh my now you know again there's so many things that we could go to we've been waiting for the coming of the lord we've been resting between revivals we can oh i remember we had this meeting that baby there you remember remember brother brad i'm talking about that baby been laying there for two days and the holy spirit raised it up again and this person came blind twisted lame afflicted i love it friends when i've seen brother ron and i stood together in meetings there in germany and they're in that meeting there as the word went forth even without hands laid on a woman come in there holding in her hands two hearing aids and said i don't need these anymore i didn't even realize what happened to me but last night i was healed in the service and i didn't catch it until when i took my hearing aids out and was in the shower and i could hear it running i could hear children outside playing i've been healed [Music] hallelujah that's what happens when jesus comes away in the congregation but brother branham said you know he isn't actually asleep because our god neither slumbers or sleep he said he's just been laying there waiting for you to come to realize your need of him amen hallelujah amen he's there he's ready to any time the moment that you start believing to heal you from your wounded broken spirit to save you by his grace somebody help me preach amen he's right there amen he's been blessing us all the time he's been listening to our testimonies yeah he even heard us when we was arguing and fussing and fighting and breaking horns over each one's head he was there all the time maybe sometimes he was grieved but he was there but he's just waiting on you this morning to say jesus the storm's too big the trouble's too great come jesus come jesus i need revival i need revival there's legions that needs deliverance they're sick that needs to be healed that's the blind eyes that needs to come open there's a death that needs to be healed he'll i need a change call him on the scene this morning amen there is hope for revival oh i went off without him there

you might be pentecostal been they've been so long since something happened in this oh they might think we're fanatics don't be afraid of him he's the one that'll make you walk on your waters hallelujah amen we need a tongue talking acts 2 38 experience we need a revival in our hearts we need to renew another holy ghost from the old to the young i don't care how long you've been in the message you need it wake that jesus in your life and if he's not there call for him and say lord help me to welcome my waters have me lord i perish once you stand to your feet right now amen you know what you need to do you know what you need to do you know you know whether he's in your boat or not amen you know you know if he's just been allowed to go to sleep and he's just been dormant there you

renewed faith a renewed love a renewed commitment unrenewed experience i want jesus i want jesus oh don't pass me by play that possibly not old gentle savior don't pass me by amen can you be the blind bartimaeus this morning said jesus [Music] amen maybe he's asleep in your book could you say jesus i want you alive and real i want to see you the same yesterday today i want to feel that quickening power again until the first love comes back until joy unspeakable and full of glory comes down into my life [Music] i want to wake you jesus let my faith reach out and wake you this morning [Music]

altar and want to try to get right and get the holy ghost and finally one day he said to me he said brother tim he said you know why i can't get the holy ghost i said what he says because i love my cigarettes and that's why i can't get him [Music] i said yeah oh it makes me feel so good after a meal i said and it's killing you it's destroying your lungs it's hurting your body it'll bring you cancer and you love that that is sworn to destroy your life more than jesus but that wasn't the end of the story he got to where he hated cigarettes and he wanted jesus amen amen he got the point that
