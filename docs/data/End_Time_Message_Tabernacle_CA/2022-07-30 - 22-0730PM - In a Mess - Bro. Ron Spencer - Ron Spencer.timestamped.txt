[1:16:32] [Music]
[1:16:34] i think we're having church
[1:16:38] what a great day it's been already
[1:16:41] this morning we had a breakfast with the
[1:16:42] ministers
[1:16:44] we had our brother paul dierksen speak
[1:16:46] to us
[1:16:47] i i believe it was just a wonderful time
[1:16:50] and sometimes we measure great men by
[1:16:54] great gifts and the things they are
[1:16:56] brother branham would give us
[1:16:58] the indication he says not the 200 pound
[1:17:00] man if it was that brother paul you and
[1:17:03] i would have been there in that category
[1:17:04] a long time ago
[1:17:06] but it's it's bigger than that he'd say
[1:17:08] it's the one who's got the baggy knees
[1:17:10] it's the one who can humble himself
[1:17:14] and he says you know show me a man that
[1:17:16] can humble himself that's conquered his
[1:17:18] spirit
[1:17:20] and our brother paul just spoke to us in
[1:17:22] a very humbling level
[1:17:24] about the god that's with us
[1:17:26] and our part to let him do his part and
[1:17:31] we appreciate that brother paul we thank
[1:17:33] you and god bless you
[1:17:35] for what you ministered to us this
[1:17:37] morning
[1:17:38] this afternoon we had a
[1:17:40] equally
[1:17:41] powerful meeting
[1:17:43] brother timothy pruitt ministered
[1:17:45] and i don't know if you had a chance to
[1:17:47] listen but i i was in my office i was
[1:17:49] streaming and i was shouting and i was
[1:17:51] jumping up and down and i was screaming
[1:17:54] and crying and and like i said it was
[1:17:56] good it was it was it was beyond what
[1:17:58] words can say
[1:18:00] and we thank god for the gift that was
[1:18:02] in our brother timothy
[1:18:05] and i told the brothers i said well
[1:18:06] that's one that's two
[1:18:09] but god does things in threes
[1:18:24] tonight we have a brother with us
[1:18:26] you may not know him
[1:18:30] um
[1:18:31] you may not have heard of him but i want
[1:18:33] to just say
[1:18:35] hell has heard of him
[1:18:37] hallelujah and i say heaven speaks to
[1:18:40] him
[1:18:42] and earth
[1:18:44] is bearing witness that the god of
[1:18:46] heaven
[1:18:47] lives in brother ron spencer
[1:18:50] and it's a miracle
[1:18:53] and as much as the devil has tried
[1:18:56] god
[1:18:58] has sought
[1:18:59] that this will be a testimony and a
[1:19:01] strength to the bride of christ
[1:19:04] i believe brother ron's here
[1:19:06] by the will of god
[1:19:08] and we want to just make room and allow
[1:19:10] them
[1:19:11] and uh
[1:19:12] i i was just saying the word is becoming
[1:19:15] flesh
[1:19:17] and i would say
[1:19:18] god has moved in these meetings
[1:19:21] it's our move
[1:19:23] this is the day this is the hour
[1:19:26] and and
[1:19:27] it all it takes is one little move on
[1:19:29] your part lord i'm sorry

[1:19:36] meeting

[1:20:26] savior leading

[1:20:34] understand
[1:20:38] and for the cause of christ i have spent
[1:20:42] my days believing
[1:20:46] that what he'd have me be
[1:20:49] is who i am
[1:20:54] and as i've come to see
[1:20:56] the weaker side of me

[1:28:46] we're not just preaching it's coming
[1:28:48] it's already here and so we are enjoying
[1:28:51] it and
[1:28:52] we're we're seeing his great works and
[1:28:54] so we think we thank the lord for that
[1:28:57] and so
[1:28:58] in the great
[1:28:59] it has transformed our children
[1:29:02] and i heard when i heard brother tim as
[1:29:04] he spoke you know you can't hand it down
[1:29:07] from generation to generation my son
[1:29:09] andrew had spoke here
[1:29:11] he received it on a street corner with
[1:29:13] brother tom ray
[1:29:15] and just in an instant he was changed
[1:29:17] brother matthew that is speaking at home
[1:29:20] right now
[1:29:21] at brother tim's meeting at the
[1:29:23] louisiana camp
[1:29:25] he just broke out and spoke in tongues
[1:29:27] all night long and
[1:29:29] and god just did a work for him and my
[1:29:32] my baby girl that's the way that she
[1:29:34] received it and so you may not receive
[1:29:37] it that way
[1:29:38] but it sure is good to feel a god that's
[1:29:41] real close to you and
[1:29:43] amen and i i so i so love you for those
[1:29:47] that don't know brother tim and i
[1:29:49] go a long way back
[1:29:51] longer than we even realized
[1:29:54] and he sent me a picture the other day
[1:29:56] and he was sitting on the jeffersonville
[1:30:00] branham tabernacle pulpit at 18 years
[1:30:03] old
[1:30:04] and so i found out it was 1972.
[1:30:08] brother minnow i was sitting in the
[1:30:10] baptistry behind him as a 12 year old
[1:30:13] boy because there wasn't room in the
[1:30:15] building so we was that close
[1:30:19] god had a plan brother tim
[1:30:22] amen and so
[1:30:23] we've loved this message all of our
[1:30:25] lives and we give ourselves to it and
[1:30:28] and it's just great amen
[1:30:30] maybe you have a need today
[1:30:33] and you could like to say
[1:30:36] as i heard the other night
[1:30:38] as bartimaeus passed by
[1:30:41] thou son of david
[1:30:42] have mercy on me
[1:30:48] because more than a man is in this
[1:30:50] building
[1:30:51] [Music]
[1:30:53] we're already aware that he's here
[1:30:56] he's the voice behind the song he's the
[1:30:58] voice behind the speaker
[1:31:01] [Music]
[1:31:03] he's whirling in the building even now
[1:31:07] now let's talk to him
[1:31:10] heavenly father
[1:31:11] [Music]
[1:31:13] there's just none like you
[1:31:19] one word from you would change our life
[1:31:23] maybe it's one sentence in an entire
[1:31:26] sermon
[1:31:26] [Music]
[1:31:28] that would turn our lives entirely
[1:31:29] around
[1:31:32] and a multitude of gathering like that
[1:31:34] is here
[1:31:36] what an incredible audience
[1:31:38] but no doubt the unseen audience is much
[1:31:41] larger than
[1:31:42] this lord you see where we're at
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:31:48] now father
[1:31:51] you're not too busy to come
[1:31:55] to where we're at now
[1:31:58] i found you a god that's faithful
[1:32:02] i found you a god that's real
[1:32:05] you're more than a quote
[1:32:07] you're more than just a scripture
[1:32:10] you're a god that can make yourself
[1:32:11] alive
[1:32:12] [Music]
[1:32:15] lord no doubt there's incredible
[1:32:17] powerful men that's
[1:32:19] standing in this pulpit that carry your
[1:32:21] gospel
[1:32:22] [Music]
[1:32:24] from outpost into many different regions
[1:32:27] i pray that
[1:32:29] that god that you would renew them
[1:32:31] [Music]
[1:32:33] recharge them like never before father
[1:32:37] in this incredible age that we're living
[1:32:39] in you called us
[1:32:41] not to just to survive but you called us
[1:32:43] to overcome
[1:32:46] now lord jesus i ask you that we can
[1:32:48] draw strength from you
[1:32:50] help us dear god today
[1:32:53] i have incredible needs as i stand
[1:32:55] behind this pulpit
[1:32:58] lord i ask you that you would come
[1:33:01] i call to you
[1:33:03] i don't call to an idol i call to a
[1:33:05] living god
[1:33:07] and you're a god that hears and answers
[1:33:09] prayer
[1:33:11] we at times get impatient
[1:33:14] but you're always on time
[1:33:17] and we take you at your word
[1:33:21] oh god now
[1:33:23] we surrender ourself both as speaker and
[1:33:26] as here
[1:33:27] lord come to our pew
[1:33:29] come to where we're sitting
[1:33:31] lord minister to our hearts now
[1:33:34] in the name of jesus christ we pray
[1:33:37] amen
[1:33:39] amen and amen and amen
[1:33:41] amen god bless you if you will turn with
[1:33:44] me in your scriptures today
[1:33:52] in second corinthians chapter 4 and
[1:33:54] verse 7.
[1:34:00] here just a short time ago i was
[1:34:02] awakened in in the night
[1:34:05] and i heard a voice calling
[1:34:08] and so from that that visitation i want
[1:34:11] to speak to you tonight
[1:34:14] i heard the voice say
[1:34:16] in a mess
[1:34:19] in a mess
[1:34:22] in a mess
[1:34:28] second corinthians chapter 4 and verse
[1:34:31] 7.
[1:34:32] but we have this treasure in earth and
[1:34:35] vessels
[1:34:36] that the excellency
[1:34:39] of the power may be of god
[1:34:42] and not of us
[1:34:43] that's an incredible scripture
[1:34:46] we are troubled on every side
[1:34:50] yet not distressed
[1:34:53] we are perplexed but not in despair
[1:34:57] we are persecuted but not forsaken
[1:35:00] cast down but not destroyed
[1:35:03] always bearing about in the body the
[1:35:06] dying of the lord jesus that the life
[1:35:09] also of jesus might be made manifest in
[1:35:12] in our body for we which are alive
[1:35:16] are always delivered unto death for
[1:35:18] jesus sake for the life also of jesus
[1:35:22] might be made manifest in our mortal
[1:35:25] flesh
[1:35:27] so then death worketh in us but life in
[1:35:30] you we have in the same spirit of faith
[1:35:33] according as it is written i believed
[1:35:36] and therefore have i spoken
[1:35:40] we also believe and therefore speak
[1:35:44] knowing that he which raised up the lord
[1:35:46] jesus shall raise us
[1:35:48] also by jesus and shall present us with
[1:35:52] you
[1:35:53] for all things are for your sakes
[1:35:57] that the abundant grace might through
[1:36:00] the transgiving the thanksgiving of many
[1:36:03] rebound to the glory of god
[1:36:06] for which cause we faint not but though
[1:36:10] our outward man perish yet the inward
[1:36:13] man is renewed day by day
[1:36:19] for our
[1:36:21] light affliction
[1:36:25] what incredible words no matter how
[1:36:27] difficult we have it
[1:36:30] for our light affliction which is but
[1:36:33] for a moment
[1:36:35] worketh for us a far more exceedingly
[1:36:38] eternal weight of glory
[1:36:40] while we look not at the things which
[1:36:42] are seen but at the things which are not
[1:36:45] seen
[1:36:46] for the things which are seen are
[1:36:48] temporal but the things which are not
[1:36:50] seen
[1:36:51] are eternal
[1:36:54] amen
[1:36:55] amen you may be seated
[1:37:06] sometime back i had a vision
[1:37:09] it was a vision it was probably maybe
[1:37:11] two years ago brother tim could probably
[1:37:14] refresh me of that
[1:37:15] i had a vision of brother tim and myself
[1:37:18] we were working in a
[1:37:20] in the evening time it was just getting
[1:37:23] to the point to where it was
[1:37:25] we could see images of
[1:37:27] of people but we
[1:37:30] we
[1:37:31] we knew that darkness were comings
[1:37:34] and we were working before a great gate
[1:37:37] and we were doing everything that we
[1:37:39] could to usher souls in through this
[1:37:42] great light to where there was a the
[1:37:44] most beautiful light that i'd ever saw
[1:37:48] light and that light was beaming out of
[1:37:51] those gates and it's
[1:37:53] it was just like a a beam of light
[1:37:56] to kind of give you an idea of what that
[1:37:58] beam would be like if you could
[1:38:00] see brother tim's windows on his church
[1:38:03] that was kind of how it was and
[1:38:06] and
[1:38:07] i was telling brother tim the vision one
[1:38:09] day and and he said kind of like that
[1:38:13] and there there was
[1:38:15] there was that
[1:38:16] that evening light light shining forth
[1:38:19] like beams of light
[1:38:22] we were working desperately
[1:38:25] to get those last souls in
[1:38:28] now just because i would call brother
[1:38:30] tim's name
[1:38:31] all of us as ministers that's what we're
[1:38:33] doing
[1:38:36] when this meeting began to be set up and
[1:38:40] and i'll just be honest with you there
[1:38:42] were a lot of days that i never thought
[1:38:44] i would be standing here
[1:38:46] even after being asked by brother harold
[1:38:48] and brother ed to come
[1:38:50] there was a lot of days that even my
[1:38:52] family said no way you can go
[1:38:57] there's good days and there's a lot of
[1:38:58] difficult days
[1:39:00] when i begin to
[1:39:02] see that the happenings of the the pope
[1:39:05] being in the same
[1:39:10] city and here we are the evening lights
[1:39:16] and i begin to see how god was dealing
[1:39:19] for this meeting
[1:39:21] all the hounds of hell
[1:39:25] couldn't have kept me from coming to
[1:39:26] this meeting
[1:39:28] because i knew this was a place
[1:39:31] where god's going to have a conference
[1:39:32] with his children
[1:39:38] i want to share with you a prayer
[1:39:41] before we get started
[1:39:44] he said now i'm going to pray for you
[1:39:46] the bible said the prayer of faith
[1:39:49] shall save the sick and god shall raise
[1:39:51] them up
[1:39:52] and if i have found grace in the blessed
[1:39:55] god may this be the night
[1:39:57] that they'll never forget
[1:40:01] could this be a night that we'll never
[1:40:03] forget
[1:40:06] may the holy spirit come into every
[1:40:08] heart
[1:40:09] just now and just move off out of all
[1:40:12] everything
[1:40:13] all the sickness from their body
[1:40:17] notice how it stands in authority
[1:40:20] i now challenge the devil to a debate
[1:40:24] satan you're aware that you are whipped
[1:40:28] you have no legal rights
[1:40:31] jesus christ my lord stripped you of
[1:40:34] every authority that you had
[1:40:37] when he died at calvary to take away sin
[1:40:40] and sickness and you're nothing but a
[1:40:42] bluff
[1:40:45] and we're calling your bluff
[1:40:47] you know that when the lord came to the
[1:40:50] tree and he cursed that tree the next
[1:40:52] day it withered and our lord said to his
[1:40:55] disciples have faith in god for if you
[1:40:58] shall say you shall say to this mountain
[1:41:01] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[1:41:04] but believe that you will have what is
[1:41:06] said it's coming to pass you can have
[1:41:09] what you have said
[1:41:12] satan you know the scripture on that and
[1:41:15] i have just taught this people that
[1:41:18] god is in them
[1:41:23] god is in them
[1:41:25] i want to say it again god is in them
[1:41:29] [Applause]
[1:41:33] and if god is in them
[1:41:36] they speak to that disease and say be
[1:41:38] away from me
[1:41:41] and don't doubt in their heart
[1:41:43] right then that disease has to move for
[1:41:47] christ said so for it's not them that
[1:41:50] speaks it's the father that dwells in
[1:41:52] them
[1:41:54] that's speaking they're in need so come
[1:41:57] out of them in the name of jesus christ
[1:42:00] i say it's god's servant by this message
[1:42:03] of the angel who anointed and has proved
[1:42:06] to the people that jesus is here and the
[1:42:09] message is right so come out of them in
[1:42:12] the name of jesus christ i adore you by
[1:42:15] the living the the every
[1:42:18] to leave every sick person and to get
[1:42:21] out of outer darkness in the name of the
[1:42:24] lord jesus christ
[1:42:29] and you that are message believers all
[1:42:32] of these years you know that god
[1:42:34] vindicated right behind that and a wind
[1:42:38] blew through that building
[1:42:46] as i stand here today
[1:42:50] and realize that
[1:42:52] every 24 hours is important
[1:42:55] today i i sat with
[1:42:58] at the table
[1:42:59] brother paul was speaking and we had
[1:43:01] breakfast
[1:43:03] it was arranged for us to set in certain
[1:43:05] spots
[1:43:07] i sat with sister connie
[1:43:10] who was my queen
[1:43:12] sister leanne
[1:43:15] sister shelley
[1:43:18] warrior
[1:43:20] i sat with some of the queens of heaven
[1:43:23] also sister mary
[1:43:26] and brother jake sat there
[1:43:31] and i thought about how god arranges
[1:43:33] everything
[1:43:35] the last time that one of the last times
[1:43:38] i was here in the final service we sang
[1:43:40] on the wings of a snow white dove
[1:43:43] and i witnessed the the dove of the holy
[1:43:46] spirit fly through this building
[1:43:50] and that and that that day brother ken
[1:43:52] would get a touch
[1:43:54] get a reprieve
[1:43:56] and go to meet the lord in just about a
[1:43:58] month or six weeks eight weeks something
[1:43:59] like that
[1:44:01] as we sit there and we begin to talk
[1:44:04] this is a very temporal land
[1:44:08] we have come to this spot maybe maybe
[1:44:11] maybe you don't understand but
[1:44:14] we have come to a spot in our lives that
[1:44:17] that every day that we live is a miracle
[1:44:22] i would like to say this to you i'd like
[1:44:24] to thank you for every prayer that
[1:44:27] you've prayed you've called
[1:44:29] you've called my name and
[1:44:31] prayed with us
[1:44:33] i'd like to thank you for that every
[1:44:35] card that you have written to me
[1:44:37] for those that don't know
[1:44:39] i am battling
[1:44:41] stage four cancer
[1:44:43] with multiple tumors in my brain
[1:44:45] my lungs is full of cancer and
[1:44:48] in some of my lymph nodes it's affected
[1:44:51] a couple of different organs and killed
[1:44:53] my pancreas and also my adrenaline
[1:44:56] glands
[1:44:57] i take chemo twice a day
[1:44:59] and about
[1:45:01] about 20 different supportive drugs that
[1:45:03] goes with all of that
[1:45:05] but let me just say this to you
[1:45:07] they said i would live for about four
[1:45:10] months
[1:45:13] but i read another report
[1:45:28] may as i just take some opening thoughts
[1:45:30] and i hope this is okay i i asked
[1:45:32] brother ed if it would be all right
[1:45:34] i stand here
[1:45:36] and i declare to you the infallible word
[1:45:39] of god
[1:45:40] while yet satan has decided that he
[1:45:43] would bombard my body with cancer but he
[1:45:47] couldn't do that
[1:45:50] he could have never touched my body
[1:45:52] except for he got permission from my god
[1:45:57] and before he touched my body god gave
[1:45:59] him permission because god had
[1:46:02] confidence
[1:46:05] in the seed that he placed on the inside
[1:46:08] of us
[1:46:09] so no matter the battle that you're
[1:46:11] going through
[1:46:12] god has got confidence in you
[1:46:14] [Applause]
[1:46:22] and to be honest with you every one of
[1:46:24] us are under a death sentence
[1:46:28] if the rapture don't come every one of
[1:46:30] us are under death sentence
[1:46:33] but god is
[1:46:35] is faithful to us
[1:46:39] brother tim nunwell are they just saying
[1:46:41] for us
[1:46:43] he's been a ghost writer for me
[1:46:46] and he just in the right moments he will
[1:46:48] he will write me things and i want to
[1:46:50] share a couple things with you today
[1:46:53] before i go into my text i hope that's
[1:46:55] okay
[1:46:59] on the roughest days
[1:47:02] the lowest hours of despair
[1:47:06] even in those times
[1:47:09] we're still chosen
[1:47:13] blessed
[1:47:15] favored
[1:47:16] forgiven
[1:47:19] loved
[1:47:20] let of god
[1:47:22] victorious
[1:47:24] inherit all of heaven's glory
[1:47:28] privilege to walk with our our own
[1:47:31] creator
[1:47:32] we're married to the queen the king of
[1:47:34] heaven
[1:47:36] and he calls us the beloved
[1:47:40] we're strong in faith
[1:47:42] we're armed to fight devils
[1:47:45] we're entrusted with god's word
[1:47:47] the most powerful weapon protected by
[1:47:50] the arm of the almighty he has placed us
[1:47:53] hedge about around us we have an
[1:47:56] assurance that each time that we call he
[1:47:59] hears
[1:48:04] the answers
[1:48:08] and the answers for our good yes
[1:48:15] in a mess
[1:48:18] don't be surprised when
[1:48:20] you find yourself in a battle for your
[1:48:22] life
[1:48:25] not just for your natural life
[1:48:30] for your spiritual life
[1:48:34] we're at the end of satan's war against
[1:48:37] the bride of jesus christ
[1:48:39] because even he senses we're getting
[1:48:41] ready to leave
[1:48:44] and he's turned loose every force
[1:48:46] against us
[1:48:47] because he don't have long could this be
[1:48:50] the last meeting could these be the last
[1:48:52] services that's what he has to deal with
[1:48:56] [Applause]
[1:49:07] as ministers you think you've come
[1:49:09] through the message and know all the
[1:49:11] doctrine let me just say he's calmed he
[1:49:13] was there when it was preached
[1:49:16] it was there when it was put on paper
[1:49:18] and put on tape and put put in computer
[1:49:21] he's been studying this message a long
[1:49:23] time to try to defeat you
[1:49:26] but because you're elected and have the
[1:49:29] seed of god on the inside of you that
[1:49:32] god zones himself lives then on the
[1:49:35] inside of you you take that same
[1:49:37] anointed word and defeat the kingdom of
[1:49:40] hell
[1:49:43] [Applause]
[1:49:48] don't be surprised when the battle comes
[1:49:50] your way
[1:49:54] you don't choose your battles
[1:49:58] none of us choose our battles
[1:50:01] on december the 22nd
[1:50:04] of 2020
[1:50:06] 19.
[1:50:08] i heard the voice of god speak
[1:50:12] and maybe you say well brother on men
[1:50:13] don't hear that no more that only went
[1:50:15] to a prophet well you you're obviously
[1:50:17] not
[1:50:18] been in none of these services
[1:50:22] and god spoke to me said
[1:50:25] if you trust me i'll use you like never
[1:50:27] before
[1:50:31] let me just say i stood in a lot of
[1:50:34] a lot of pulpits and preached and and a
[1:50:36] lot of incredible meetings and taking
[1:50:39] place
[1:50:40] i've seen cancers come off i've seen the
[1:50:43] eyes open i i've seen ears come i've
[1:50:46] seen limbs grow
[1:50:48] i've seen dead babies that were getting
[1:50:50] ready to be delivered in a few days
[1:50:53] those babies be born well alive
[1:50:56] we've seen wounds become fertile
[1:51:01] we've seen the dead raised
[1:51:04] we've taken a hold of crippled bay legs
[1:51:07] of of children and and literally watched
[1:51:10] them run across the buildings
[1:51:14] we we've seen men walk all the way from
[1:51:17] the back of the building with braces on
[1:51:19] their legs and and crutches and and all
[1:51:23] around walking and as the word was going
[1:51:26] forth getting toward the front of the
[1:51:28] building throwing down their canes and
[1:51:30] taking off their crutches and dancing
[1:51:33] all over the building
[1:51:37] so maybe we were expecting maybe even a
[1:51:40] higher realm of that
[1:51:42] not knowing that god was going to allow
[1:51:45] us to go into a battle to encourage you
[1:51:52] that no matter what you face in life
[1:51:55] god will be with you
[1:51:57] [Applause]
[1:52:02] got some signals that things were
[1:52:04] beginning to happen
[1:52:06] brother tim brought us rocks from where
[1:52:09] david picked up stones
[1:52:11] in that valley
[1:52:13] brother kelly brought us a coin that
[1:52:16] commemorated normandy
[1:52:18] that said except
[1:52:20] nothing but full victory
[1:52:26] a brother walked in my back
[1:52:29] my back office door
[1:52:32] he had wanted to buy me a real
[1:52:33] high-priced
[1:52:34] rifle
[1:52:36] and i told him i had i i really i really
[1:52:38] didn't want him to do that
[1:52:40] i didn't want him to spend that kind of
[1:52:42] a money he said i just want to do it for
[1:52:45] you
[1:52:47] and he he went to prayer
[1:52:50] and in prayer the lord spoke to him and
[1:52:52] said he needs a sling
[1:52:58] and he walked into my office the very
[1:53:00] night that we were
[1:53:02] getting ready to tell the audience that
[1:53:04] we had cancer and they were we were
[1:53:06] ready to enter into the battle of cancer
[1:53:09] and he all walked in and handed me a
[1:53:11] sling to go with those rocks
[1:53:14] god was going telling me
[1:53:17] [Applause]
[1:53:19] i got your battle
[1:53:22] [Applause]
[1:53:32] time becomes
[1:53:33] so incredible precious
[1:53:37] let me just say this to you at this
[1:53:38] point
[1:53:39] you may be so busy in life that you're
[1:53:42] not taking time for your family
[1:53:45] but let me just say that's one of those
[1:53:47] precious things that there is
[1:53:51] your amen should have been a whole lot
[1:53:52] better than that
[1:53:56] family time
[1:53:58] is so awesome
[1:54:01] last monday as they were putting me to
[1:54:03] sleep for an operation
[1:54:06] last monday
[1:54:08] they were putting me to sleep for an
[1:54:10] operation
[1:54:12] they had been in the in the room with me
[1:54:13] for about an hour and
[1:54:16] doing all the interview and everything
[1:54:17] that they were going to do
[1:54:20] and they were the lady that was going to
[1:54:21] put me to sleep she was such a nice lady
[1:54:24] and
[1:54:25] and she took me through
[1:54:27] through all the facility there wanting
[1:54:29] me to meet everybody and she said you're
[1:54:32] a celebrity here in our hospital and so
[1:54:35] and so she was taking me through and i
[1:54:37] got to meet people and
[1:54:39] and when they took me into the operating
[1:54:41] room to roll over my side and they put
[1:54:43] the apparatus in my mouth and over my
[1:54:46] head and began to tie me down she said
[1:54:48] now i want you to think on what makes
[1:54:50] you so happy
[1:54:52] she said what what makes you so happy
[1:54:54] and i said spending time with my family
[1:54:59] that's what heaven's gonna be like
[1:55:02] [Applause]
[1:55:09] amen
[1:55:18] i didn't go to sleep as they were giving
[1:55:19] me the medicine she said ron it's okay
[1:55:21] to relax just relax now and breathe real
[1:55:24] deep
[1:55:26] and she told the other girl she said i
[1:55:28] think i've lost my touch
[1:55:31] well in a minute she proved she had to
[1:55:33] touch
[1:55:38] my queen sits here 39 years we just had
[1:55:41] an anniversary
[1:55:45] she's been so incredible faithful
[1:55:51] incredible faithful to be with us
[1:55:57] we've been in so many doctor's
[1:55:59] appointments about every week we're
[1:56:01] we're in one or two
[1:56:03] doctor's appointments and we've been
[1:56:05] given an incredible team
[1:56:11] most of them are
[1:56:12] catholic but almost every one of them
[1:56:15] say
[1:56:17] your god
[1:56:23] and they
[1:56:26] they told me the other day said we've
[1:56:28] had hundreds pass while you've been here
[1:56:33] but you look like a picture of health
[1:56:37] that's our god
[1:56:48] let me just say this to you as i would
[1:56:50] whisper to devil the devil's ear
[1:56:53] he could have he would have killed us
[1:56:56] if he could have
[1:57:01] [Applause]
[1:57:04] the pain that we suffer it's not
[1:57:06] permanent
[1:57:11] for you may be the darkness that is
[1:57:13] around you
[1:57:15] and you may think there's no way out of
[1:57:17] it
[1:57:18] let me just say
[1:57:20] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:57:22] lights
[1:57:24] [Applause]
[1:57:24] [Music]
[1:57:28] now as i begin to work my way
[1:57:31] i want you to understand that no matter
[1:57:33] how difficult your situation is god's
[1:57:36] greater
[1:57:37] [Applause]
[1:57:42] no matter how many times he knocks the
[1:57:44] devil knocks you down
[1:57:46] get out
[1:57:47] [Applause]
[1:57:51] get up
[1:57:53] you have heard me preach positive for
[1:57:56] for now decades
[1:57:58] but no matter how difficult the morning
[1:58:02] no matter how many times we up chuck
[1:58:04] we just keep getting up
[1:58:06] [Applause]
[1:58:12] i want to quote brother ken
[1:58:17] he quoted it from muhammad ali
[1:58:22] he said muhammad ali was in a fight and
[1:58:24] it seemed like he was going to lose
[1:58:27] and he was up against the ropes
[1:58:29] and he said muhammad ali got his his
[1:58:32] opponent right up into his ear and he
[1:58:34] whispered in his ear and said is that
[1:58:36] all you got
[1:58:39] come on
[1:58:52] brother ron but i've never heard a
[1:58:53] preacher open a service like this in a
[1:58:55] camp meeting you've never heard a
[1:58:57] preacher stand where i'm standing
[1:59:00] so it gives me license to tell you in
[1:59:03] the midst of a battle
[1:59:05] you've got a right
[1:59:09] you've got a response to speak right
[1:59:11] back to the enemy
[1:59:14] no matter how difficult that it is
[1:59:16] you got a right to speak back to him
[1:59:20] [Applause]
[1:59:22] sister melody our trials may be deep and
[1:59:25] dark but god's greater than our trials
[1:59:34] i'd like to say to to the enemy
[1:59:37] i'd like to warn him
[1:59:39] he thinks he gave me a death sentence
[1:59:42] but he's really got one
[1:59:44] [Applause]
[1:59:54] my journey like yours
[1:59:57] has a lot of difficulties in it
[2:00:00] we have to battle
[2:00:02] there's no days off
[2:00:04] but i want to say this to you
[2:00:07] your battle may be difficult but don't
[2:00:09] you never give up
[2:00:15] young people don't you never give up
[2:00:18] moms and dad don't you never give up
[2:00:24] brother ron but that's a simple
[2:00:25] statement is it
[2:00:29] brother branham felt like giving up
[2:00:32] other great prophets felt like giving up
[2:00:35] so you're going to be tempted to give up
[2:00:41] you're going to be tempted to quit going
[2:00:43] to church but there's something on the
[2:00:45] inside of you keeps telling you keep
[2:00:47] going
[2:00:48] keep going keep going
[2:00:51] [Applause]
[2:00:57] your trial don't own you
[2:01:04] your trial don't own you
[2:01:08] you may be in a horrible mess
[2:01:11] today and don't see your way out
[2:01:13] and it looks so dark
[2:01:16] just follow the glimmer of light it'll
[2:01:18] lead you to the day
[2:01:25] many of our wars are extremely private
[2:01:37] mind the incredible
[2:01:39] surgeries
[2:01:41] brain surgeries
[2:01:47] shots
[2:01:49] we take about eight shots a day
[2:01:52] the invasive test
[2:01:54] because they've got to see if it's
[2:01:56] growing if it's moving
[2:02:00] they constantly repeat brother branham's
[2:02:02] words satan runs
[2:02:05] it hides
[2:02:07] it lives on living cells
[2:02:09] it don't have a life of its own but it's
[2:02:11] a death cell
[2:02:12] so it's trying to suck the life out of
[2:02:14] you
[2:02:16] they quote our prophet over and over
[2:02:18] again i wonder where they got that from
[2:02:24] seizures
[2:02:33] brother ron why are you telling us that
[2:02:37] i i want to just tell you this
[2:02:39] goliath will always remind you how big
[2:02:41] he is
[2:02:46] goliath will always tell you
[2:02:49] how big he is
[2:02:52] but there's a rock
[2:02:54] that you picked up
[2:02:56] [Applause]
[2:02:58] that will fly with
[2:03:00] supersonic speed
[2:03:03] that's what brother branham said it'll
[2:03:04] fly with supersonic speed that will go
[2:03:08] through any
[2:03:14] but you've just got to have the faith to
[2:03:16] sling the rock
[2:03:17] [Applause]
[2:03:27] i'm afraid people take for granted
[2:03:31] that these are the ways that things is
[2:03:33] always going to be
[2:03:36] maybe we could think of left behind
[2:03:40] i don't want to be left behind
[2:03:43] i don't want my children to be left
[2:03:44] behind
[2:03:47] i don't ever want to take a service like
[2:03:49] this for granted
[2:03:50] [Music]
[2:03:53] sometimes we have a lack of appreciation
[2:03:55] of the value
[2:03:56] not knowing the cost of what it takes
[2:04:02] to get a man to a spot
[2:04:05] a profit to a spot
[2:04:07] to where he can stand there with the
[2:04:09] authority of the word of god
[2:04:12] and speak the seals
[2:04:17] and speak in chronological order the
[2:04:19] mind of god
[2:04:23] and then standing on this on the wings
[2:04:25] of a snow white dove
[2:04:27] though all of the criticism the light of
[2:04:30] the nonsense
[2:04:31] through the backdrop
[2:04:33] of a lot of things happening in the
[2:04:35] world
[2:04:40] the message got through
[2:04:44] a lot of people wants the message or
[2:04:47] they want the life
[2:04:48] but they don't want to pay the price
[2:04:55] people refuse to commit
[2:04:57] is this okay
[2:05:01] they refuse to commit
[2:05:03] because it's going to take some cost
[2:05:06] it's going to take some flesh and skin
[2:05:08] it's going to take your life
[2:05:17] i want to say this to you quit is not in
[2:05:21] my vocabulary
[2:05:29] i have been asked over and over again by
[2:05:31] some of the greatest doctors
[2:05:34] are you ready to quit
[2:05:35] are you ready to give up
[2:05:38] give up
[2:05:42] are you being serious
[2:05:45] we're just getting started
[2:05:58] when i hear the doctors tell me that
[2:06:00] every day is a miracle i'm glad i can
[2:06:03] enjoy every day
[2:06:07] brother tim i i haven't found you yet
[2:06:09] i've looked
[2:06:11] he sent me this
[2:06:14] he said we shall fight on the beaches
[2:06:17] we shall fight on the landing grounds
[2:06:20] we shall fight in the fields and in the
[2:06:22] streets
[2:06:23] we shall fight in the hills
[2:06:25] we shall never surrender
[2:06:27] [Applause]
[2:06:34] hallelujah
[2:06:37] may i say this in this meeting
[2:06:39] though it looks like we're in a mess
[2:06:42] we'll never surrender
[2:06:49] we will fight for our families
[2:06:51] we will fight for our children
[2:06:54] we'll fight for our healing we'll fight
[2:06:56] for our deliverance
[2:06:58] we will fight for joy
[2:07:00] we will fight for peace we will fight
[2:07:02] for the holy ghost
[2:07:04] we will fight until our bodies are
[2:07:06] changed
[2:07:17] we will fight till we're sitting at the
[2:07:20] marriage supper of the lamb
[2:07:34] in the darkest of your days
[2:07:38] god's working
[2:07:42] when you don't see god working
[2:07:45] he's working
[2:07:46] [Applause]
[2:07:48] when it looks like you're losing
[2:07:51] he's working
[2:07:52] [Applause]
[2:07:55] he's not the kind of businessman that
[2:07:57] gets in the middle of a project and says
[2:07:59] i quit
[2:08:02] he has provided the way
[2:08:05] [Applause]
[2:08:07] he has all it takes to get us through
[2:08:09] [Applause]
[2:08:17] heard last night revival killers
[2:08:22] i'd like to speak to
[2:08:24] to some personal things
[2:08:28] personal things will distract you
[2:08:33] personal friends
[2:08:35] who are miserable
[2:08:38] want you to be miserable
[2:08:44] because they're a mess
[2:08:48] hurt people
[2:08:49] that no doubt
[2:08:51] didn't want to be hurt
[2:08:53] will later hurt other people
[2:08:59] generally they don't hurt people that
[2:09:01] they don't know they hurt people that's
[2:09:03] closest to them i'm preaching to you now
[2:09:13] the spirit of hate
[2:09:14] is the very opposite of love
[2:09:18] you may think i'm way off or trying to
[2:09:20] give you some psychology but i'm
[2:09:21] actually talking to you right out of
[2:09:24] where brother branham talks about the
[2:09:26] magnet
[2:09:30] hate is the very opposite of love
[2:09:35] you know it takes a lot of energy to
[2:09:36] hate
[2:09:42] it takes an absolute lot of energy to
[2:09:43] hate
[2:09:45] and satan has spent all of his energy
[2:09:47] against you
[2:09:49] because he hates what you're doing
[2:09:55] jesus had his critics
[2:09:57] you're going to have yours
[2:10:02] if you don't know this maybe you're
[2:10:03] young enough you don't know this but
[2:10:05] critics are driven to tear you apart
[2:10:10] satan anoints people
[2:10:12] pastors all over the building you
[2:10:14] understand what i'm saying right now
[2:10:16] satan anoints these people with a spirit
[2:10:20] and they
[2:10:21] the life of power and death is in a
[2:10:23] tongue
[2:10:24] and so they will use that tongue of
[2:10:26] negativity
[2:10:28] to try to put you in a mess
[2:10:32] our response is to stay focused and
[2:10:34] overcome
[2:10:38] brother ray we are on a mission
[2:10:43] we're sealed with the holy ghost
[2:10:46] satan might be able to touch your flesh
[2:10:48] and he might be able to touch your
[2:10:49] spirit
[2:10:50] but he can't get to that gene seed on
[2:10:52] the inside of you
[2:10:55] [Music]
[2:10:56] and if you can just stay in the word of
[2:10:58] god the whole the whole armor of god
[2:11:01] that has been given to you it is the
[2:11:03] spoken word and if you can quote it
[2:11:06] across your lips whether you're feeling
[2:11:08] it or whether you're not feeling it
[2:11:11] [Applause]
[2:11:11] [Music]
[2:11:16] so many people are against emotion
[2:11:21] but i don't know about you
[2:11:23] i like emotion
[2:11:24] [Applause]
[2:11:27] i don't think you have to have a motion
[2:11:29] to get the new birth but i'll tell you
[2:11:30] what the new birth will cause you
[2:11:34] to be emotional
[2:11:35] [Applause]
[2:11:36] the new birth is a mess
[2:11:41] we heard it last night i'll get to it in
[2:11:43] just a couple of moments
[2:11:45] brother branham was an emotional man
[2:11:48] he was running around a tree
[2:11:52] he was going across the pulpit over and
[2:11:54] over with his jacket over top of his
[2:11:56] head
[2:11:57] he found himself sitting on the pulpit
[2:12:00] going up and down the aisle
[2:12:04] pulling his pants legs up
[2:12:12] he was running in and out of buildings
[2:12:13] even while he preached you may not hear
[2:12:15] that but he did those things
[2:12:17] but but let me just say this you he was
[2:12:19] an emotional prophet
[2:12:24] now for
[2:12:25] you young guys
[2:12:27] you may not understand it but you will
[2:12:29] want to marry an emotional woman
[2:12:37] you don't want to marry a mannequin
[2:12:42] she may smile at you all the time
[2:12:46] but she won't cook she won't clean
[2:12:50] and i'm not even going no further
[2:12:53] [Applause]
[2:12:56] so many people want church like that
[2:13:05] and that's why churches have become a
[2:13:07] mess
[2:13:08] they've become an intellectual ted talk
[2:13:13] because preachers that don't have the
[2:13:14] holy ghost can't
[2:13:17] [Applause]
[2:13:18] ice machines produce ice cubes
[2:13:23] and a preacher that's got the holy ghost
[2:13:25] and fire in his life he's got passion
[2:13:28] and he's driven
[2:13:32] and he can see that the world's in a
[2:13:34] mess
[2:13:35] and we don't have a lot of more services
[2:13:37] to go to and we've got to give every bit
[2:13:40] of our energies that we can give
[2:13:46] and if the song leader challenges to get
[2:13:48] with me get with him
[2:13:51] [Applause]
[2:13:53] well i was born non-emotional well just
[2:13:55] get the new birth it'll take care of
[2:13:57] that for you
[2:14:00] [Applause]
[2:14:06] we heard last night easy believism
[2:14:09] easy
[2:14:10] believism
[2:14:12] you know i i was raised in the message
[2:14:16] under a pastor
[2:14:17] heard the tapes
[2:14:19] every day
[2:14:21] every day
[2:14:23] we we knew the message backwards and
[2:14:25] forwards
[2:14:27] church age book was read written
[2:14:30] we were commanded as children to cut our
[2:14:32] teeth on the church age book but later
[2:14:34] here brother tim was much like that
[2:14:40] i want to say this to you that didn't
[2:14:41] give me a new birth
[2:14:43] that put me in the right atmosphere
[2:14:46] but i needed to meet the author
[2:14:51] [Applause]
[2:14:53] [Music]
[2:14:56] are you with me now i needed to meet the
[2:14:57] author of the book
[2:15:00] there's a lot of people that can can
[2:15:02] tell you about the stars in heaven and
[2:15:05] and the astronauts and and all those
[2:15:07] different kind of things but they're
[2:15:08] scared of heights
[2:15:13] tell you about the deep oceans and going
[2:15:16] down to the bottom of the valleys and
[2:15:18] the oceans and how deep they are maybe
[2:15:20] even tell you where the titanic is at
[2:15:26] i was standing i was standing in a hotel
[2:15:28] today and i was standing beside of a
[2:15:31] rock fireplace
[2:15:33] sister connie went to the washroom i was
[2:15:35] waiting on brother timothy to bring the
[2:15:37] car around and a man came in he had his
[2:15:40] work clothes on and
[2:15:42] another man was with him and
[2:15:44] and he said
[2:15:45] i can't remember the guy's name but he
[2:15:46] called me jack something
[2:15:48] he
[2:15:49] jack
[2:15:51] jack delgado
[2:15:52] i had no idea who jack delgado was
[2:15:56] he said jack delgado
[2:16:01] he said i've i've waited my life to meet
[2:16:03] you
[2:16:04] i'm a huge fan of yours
[2:16:09] and he and he ran over and he grabbed my
[2:16:11] hand and shook my hand i was just
[2:16:13] standing kind of startled and
[2:16:15] and he was shaking my hand and
[2:16:18] and i
[2:16:19] and i was standing there and he said
[2:16:22] take a picture
[2:16:30] somewhere now there's going to be
[2:16:31] somebody bright enough to say you didn't
[2:16:34] meet jack dalgado
[2:16:44] now here's why i use that there's a lot
[2:16:46] of people that said in church
[2:16:48] they didn't meet jesus
[2:16:50] [Applause]
[2:16:54] they met the personality of a man and it
[2:16:57] produces masses
[2:17:03] it produces lives of carnal nature
[2:17:05] fusses in the church
[2:17:07] splits all over the place
[2:17:10] children that become rotten eggs
[2:17:13] [Applause]
[2:17:16] well brother on we're just going to walk
[2:17:18] away you may survive but your children's
[2:17:20] not going to survive
[2:17:23] brother branham said he said
[2:17:25] if you can look tonight if you could
[2:17:27] just make a choice tonight
[2:17:29] five years from now where will we be
[2:17:34] be a real christian
[2:17:39] or we could be in the bar room in hell
[2:17:41] five years from now
[2:17:43] you'll be amazed making the wrong
[2:17:45] choices how quick sin will take you down
[2:17:51] leaving the message is like falling off
[2:17:53] of a cliff
[2:17:55] because sin and all the atmosphere of
[2:17:58] sin and all the sodom conditions that
[2:18:00] are all around us
[2:18:03] you never thought you'd have all of
[2:18:04] those piercings you never thought you'd
[2:18:06] have all those tattoos you never thought
[2:18:08] that you'd be an alcoholic you never
[2:18:11] thought that you'd be a homosexual
[2:18:13] you never thought you'd be divorced and
[2:18:15] married to another woman you never
[2:18:18] thought that the enemy that was at war
[2:18:20] with you would destroy you
[2:18:26] but your excuse was i didn't like the
[2:18:28] preacher i didn't like the message i
[2:18:30] didn't like what the word said you
[2:18:32] refused headship
[2:18:34] [Music]
[2:18:41] and it produced a mess
[2:18:55] sometimes we get frustrated
[2:18:58] we get exhausted
[2:19:00] we're going to underweight too much
[2:19:02] pressure
[2:19:04] if we're not careful we'll have a lack
[2:19:06] of commitment
[2:19:08] most talented people
[2:19:10] are lazy
[2:19:17] because they can make their way through
[2:19:19] it
[2:19:23] but the person that's willing to put
[2:19:25] their whole life on the line
[2:19:29] that will take responsibility and
[2:19:31] realize this is my 24 hours this is my
[2:19:34] service
[2:19:35] [Music]
[2:19:35] [Applause]
[2:19:40] this is my revival
[2:19:42] we can't go backwards we can only go
[2:19:44] forward
[2:19:46] [Applause]
[2:19:48] we sat on we sat on the platform in 72
[2:19:50] and in the baptistry in 72 we can't go
[2:19:53] back there
[2:19:56] our grandmothers
[2:19:58] grandmothers and our families danced in
[2:20:01] the spirit it was real
[2:20:03] bullets shot in and shot on their
[2:20:06] dresses
[2:20:07] let me just say it was real
[2:20:12] and the bullets fell down off of their
[2:20:14] dresses
[2:20:18] brother branham talks about that
[2:20:21] i want a real revival in this day
[2:20:27] brother branham was even challenged
[2:20:29] brother minnow
[2:20:31] he was even challenged by satan himself
[2:20:35] and the enemy told him
[2:20:37] god don't love you
[2:20:41] i want to just ask this audience
[2:20:44] how many of you have had that same enemy
[2:20:48] tell you that same thing
[2:20:53] and then when we're asked this
[2:20:55] brother branham said just when i was
[2:20:57] getting ready to give up
[2:21:01] [Applause]
[2:21:02] now i want to talk to you strong ones
[2:21:04] just now you're not the one holding on
[2:21:07] [Applause]
[2:21:11] don't roll your shoulders back and think
[2:21:12] you're holding on
[2:21:15] as a matter of fact there's a hedge of
[2:21:16] protection around you to watch over your
[2:21:18] life
[2:21:19] and thank god for the devils that we
[2:21:21] never see or we never get have to fight
[2:21:24] god fights our battles
[2:21:41] the enemy tells us nobody cares for you
[2:21:46] when the opposite is the truth
[2:21:51] brother ron i have felt like at times
[2:21:53] given up well let me just let me just
[2:21:55] share something with you
[2:21:58] every overcomer
[2:22:00] has felt the urge to give up
[2:22:05] every
[2:22:06] prophet has felt the urge to give up
[2:22:10] and god made his prophets write it down
[2:22:15] he wanted him to write it down to let
[2:22:18] us know is believe us
[2:22:20] it's not you overcoming it's him
[2:22:23] overcoming
[2:22:30] jesus even prayed
[2:22:32] father if it would be possible let this
[2:22:35] cut pass from me
[2:22:38] brother branham felt like giving up
[2:22:41] presidents feel like giving up
[2:22:44] kings fill up given up
[2:22:49] every person that's ever did anything
[2:22:51] worth doing has felt like giving up
[2:22:55] i want to read to you my favorite
[2:22:56] scripture behold i have created the
[2:22:59] smith that bloweth the coals in the fire
[2:23:02] that bringeth forth an instrument for
[2:23:03] the work
[2:23:05] i have created the waster to destroy
[2:23:08] no weapon that is formed against thee
[2:23:12] shall prosper
[2:23:14] and every tongue that shall rise against
[2:23:16] thee in the judgment thou shalt condemn
[2:23:20] [Applause]
[2:23:21] so the trial that you're going through
[2:23:24] you are now a witness against the devil
[2:23:36] sister leanne you were incredible
[2:23:38] caregiver
[2:23:39] sister shelley you're an incredible
[2:23:41] caregiver
[2:23:42] to mighty men of
[2:23:44] god you're going to be a witness one of
[2:23:47] these days
[2:23:49] that was the tormentor
[2:23:51] and based on that god ascend those
[2:23:54] demons in the outer darkness
[2:23:57] [Applause]
[2:24:07] brother ron i i just don't understand
[2:24:10] i just don't understand
[2:24:15] why me
[2:24:21] why me
[2:24:23] i don't know how long i've been i didn't
[2:24:25] set my clock
[2:24:34] i find your clocks don't work here
[2:24:39] they're two hours behind
[2:24:45] but sister connie will remind me if i go
[2:24:47] too long it went too long
[2:24:51] these seats are hard
[2:24:58] i know what you're talking about you
[2:24:59] know what i'm saying right now
[2:25:02] don't be angels we in church here
[2:25:11] i want to talk to you about a man that
[2:25:12] finds himself in a mess
[2:25:16] brother tim has been doing a
[2:25:18] series if you haven't heard it go listen
[2:25:20] to it
[2:25:22] you got a pastor don't don't do it on
[2:25:23] sunday morning go listen to it
[2:25:27] it's talking about all shady our
[2:25:29] strength
[2:25:32] can we work out a proceeds offering or
[2:25:34] something like that i
[2:25:39] he's been talking about how god is a
[2:25:41] strength
[2:25:46] god comes and he calls him and he calls
[2:25:48] him by his name
[2:25:51] he takes him on a journey
[2:25:54] kind of like the one you're on
[2:25:56] kind of like the one i'm on
[2:25:58] and he begins to take him on a journey
[2:26:00] and he didn't know where he was going
[2:26:02] kind of like the one you're on
[2:26:04] and kind of like the one i'm on are you
[2:26:06] getting the gist
[2:26:09] we don't know where this journey ends
[2:26:10] but
[2:26:12] if he's leading we can't lose
[2:26:15] [Applause]
[2:26:18] and so as
[2:26:20] as abraham is taking his journey he
[2:26:22] begins to
[2:26:23] witness of what god is doing
[2:26:26] god told me that
[2:26:27] he's my shield and he's my buckler
[2:26:32] he has personally told me sarah
[2:26:35] that he's
[2:26:36] got a covenant between me and him
[2:26:41] and he's telling me things and
[2:26:43] sarah
[2:26:45] now i'm just going quickly now
[2:26:47] sarah
[2:26:48] he changed my name
[2:26:51] and in changing my name
[2:26:53] he put his own breath
[2:26:56] so every time my name is called the
[2:26:59] breath of god
[2:27:01] is praised and worshipped
[2:27:08] and we find out even now that every time
[2:27:10] the scripture said let everything that
[2:27:12] hath breath
[2:27:13] praise you the lord
[2:27:16] so literally every time you breathe
[2:27:19] across your lips and your nose you're
[2:27:23] actually worshiping god
[2:27:29] [Applause]
[2:27:33] so why not praise the lord
[2:27:35] [Applause]
[2:27:48] abraham is
[2:27:50] living just outside there's a split that
[2:27:52] comes in the church
[2:27:56] split comes in the church personalities
[2:27:59] happen
[2:28:02] abraham has brought along people that he
[2:28:03] thought were believers and he found out
[2:28:06] later they really wasn't believers so it
[2:28:08] costs a split in the church and
[2:28:11] and he goes and he cast
[2:28:13] like casts his lots toward
[2:28:15] all of the possibilities of sodom
[2:28:19] and as he goes towards sodom he don't
[2:28:22] never realize he's going to become the
[2:28:23] mayor
[2:28:27] and they don't realize how sinful the
[2:28:29] place is going to be
[2:28:31] and jesus would bring it up
[2:28:34] that this age is going to be like that
[2:28:36] age
[2:28:40] and so we realize there's a lot of
[2:28:41] parallels that are happening here
[2:28:44] this world is a mess
[2:28:50] and god has spoken through
[2:28:52] through
[2:28:53] he has spoken
[2:28:55] through the pillar of fire
[2:28:57] he has came down and walked through the
[2:29:00] sacrifices
[2:29:02] he's he spoke lip to ear to abraham and
[2:29:06] he's making his journey
[2:29:09] and he's telling him
[2:29:11] because because god has a plan
[2:29:15] and i want you to always remember at the
[2:29:17] end of the day
[2:29:19] god has a plan
[2:29:25] you were pre-planned
[2:29:28] you was not an accident as you heard
[2:29:30] today
[2:29:31] you were pre-planned you were born on a
[2:29:33] certain day you were born with certain
[2:29:35] hair color you were born brother max
[2:29:38] short
[2:29:40] but always remember dynamite comes in
[2:29:43] short packages
[2:29:55] and abraham is on his journey
[2:30:00] a fight comes
[2:30:02] the brethren come lot
[2:30:05] makes a decision
[2:30:07] to go god tells him pick which way you
[2:30:10] want to go
[2:30:12] listen there will be a lot of people
[2:30:13] walk away from you let them go
[2:30:18] let them go bad influences have only
[2:30:20] dragged you down
[2:30:23] there's certain friends there's going to
[2:30:24] be a lot of things you've got to walk
[2:30:26] away from
[2:30:32] so
[2:30:33] and so lot makes his journey
[2:30:37] now notice when there comes a separation
[2:30:40] of the two seeds
[2:30:43] now there's a greater fellowship
[2:30:50] now there's a greater fellowship
[2:30:53] now it's more than a pillar of fire
[2:30:57] now it's more than a voice
[2:31:00] now it's a man
[2:31:06] and that man
[2:31:09] now is there to confirm
[2:31:12] what he has been talking to abraham
[2:31:14] about
[2:31:18] you know sometimes
[2:31:20] let's just be honest with you there's
[2:31:21] sometimes we just don't get it
[2:31:26] we set for decades in a pew
[2:31:29] saint pew and we just don't get it and
[2:31:32] all of a sudden this a preacher out of
[2:31:35] nowhere says something
[2:31:39] [Applause]
[2:31:44] and he literally just ignites it
[2:31:50] amen
[2:31:52] we had an older brother that was in our
[2:31:53] church
[2:31:55] he ran the beach at normandy
[2:31:59] and he said people were dying all around
[2:32:01] me
[2:32:02] and he said when i ran off the boat he
[2:32:04] said i ran into bloody water people was
[2:32:07] dying
[2:32:08] and he said i was just determined keep
[2:32:10] running
[2:32:11] and he kept running he said i'll
[2:32:13] probably die in this water and he said i
[2:32:15] made it to the sand
[2:32:17] and he said i got to the sand the whole
[2:32:19] beach was full of bodies
[2:32:21] and he said all i knew was keep running
[2:32:24] and he said
[2:32:26] he said i got to the wall
[2:32:28] and i was standing there with my machine
[2:32:30] gun in my in my hands and he said how
[2:32:33] did i get here
[2:32:37] 50 years later he's sitting
[2:32:40] in a message church and i'm preaching to
[2:32:42] him
[2:32:45] god watched over your
[2:32:47] [Applause]
[2:32:50] seat he watched over your seat at war he
[2:32:54] watched over you when you were an alien
[2:32:56] from god he watched over you when you
[2:32:59] were making choices that were horrendous
[2:33:02] choices
[2:33:03] god watched over you
[2:33:07] our god don't give up
[2:33:09] [Applause]
[2:33:24] abraham has told sarah
[2:33:27] now we could say for decades
[2:33:29] that
[2:33:30] she's going to have a child
[2:33:38] but she didn't get it
[2:33:41] because all she saw was her flesh
[2:33:45] her inability
[2:33:48] i can't produce the rapture
[2:33:54] i can't produce the resurrection
[2:33:57] i can't produce the promised one
[2:34:01] but one day there was a man walked into
[2:34:03] the church meeting
[2:34:10] and
[2:34:11] they were having communion
[2:34:14] [Music]
[2:34:22] no doubt abraham entertained a lot of
[2:34:24] guests
[2:34:25] but this was greater than just a gas
[2:34:32] i don't know where you noticed it
[2:34:33] there's an atmosphere here now that
[2:34:37] the guest is in the room
[2:34:40] [Music]
[2:34:47] and he's sitting there and he's talking
[2:34:48] to abraham
[2:34:50] who already believes
[2:34:56] now he got to get his bride
[2:35:01] and it's been a tough day
[2:35:04] she's all in a fussy quarly
[2:35:07] stewie
[2:35:09] she's seen a caravan go down to mrs
[2:35:11] lott's house and they get all the good
[2:35:13] stuff and they're out there in that hot
[2:35:15] desert louisiana
[2:35:20] and
[2:35:21] they're in a hot desert
[2:35:27] she's just complaining
[2:35:29] but abraham keeps herself in the
[2:35:31] atmosphere
[2:35:34] kind of like parents keeping their self
[2:35:36] in the atmosphere
[2:35:38] their children's on the way
[2:35:41] the prodigal's on the way
[2:35:50] [Applause]
[2:35:54] and abraham
[2:35:56] is sitting there
[2:35:58] and he knows who he is
[2:36:02] they've had fellowship for quite a while
[2:36:07] now
[2:36:08] he's going to do something
[2:36:10] that he's going to use
[2:36:13] at the end time
[2:36:18] that our prophet would say and go right
[2:36:20] back to that point
[2:36:24] more than discernment
[2:36:28] morty than telepathy
[2:36:31] but an all-knowing god knows where his
[2:36:34] seed is at
[2:36:35] [Applause]
[2:36:37] [Music]
[2:36:39] turn his back over and over again
[2:36:42] to the audiences and tell them exactly
[2:36:45] there's never been a televangelist
[2:36:47] anywhere in the world
[2:36:50] come anywhere near close
[2:36:56] some of you couldn't tell
[2:36:58] 22 distinct things about yourself and
[2:37:01] that profit
[2:37:03] with that messiah sign stand there
[2:37:06] tell you who you are
[2:37:09] you knew that
[2:37:11] tell you what your address you knew that
[2:37:14] tell you your condition you knew that
[2:37:17] then take you back 40 years things that
[2:37:20] you couldn't remember
[2:37:22] [Applause]
[2:37:24] tell you where that disease came from
[2:37:27] doctors have been trying to find it for
[2:37:29] decades and a profit in a few moments
[2:37:43] what do you don't realize that god did
[2:37:45] that same thing in this meeting
[2:37:49] he started on thursday night
[2:37:52] and then last night and today and he's
[2:37:55] doing it tonight
[2:37:58] we're not going to have another prophet
[2:38:00] rise on the scene but it's the mighty
[2:38:02] angel that's among us
[2:38:05] because you're important enough to come
[2:38:08] to where you're at
[2:38:11] he knows what a mess that you're in
[2:38:15] and he's the fixture of your mass
[2:38:22] [Applause]
[2:38:32] and he asked he asked her
[2:38:35] like i'm asking you now
[2:38:38] like i'm asking myself
[2:38:40] is there anything too hard
[2:38:50] is there anything too hard
[2:38:53] for the lord
[2:39:01] there's some things that i'm amazed just
[2:39:03] now
[2:39:07] since that happened
[2:39:09] until our day
[2:39:12] there wasn't a preacher
[2:39:15] there wasn't a theologian
[2:39:19] minor or major prophet
[2:39:23] but only under the seals
[2:39:25] picked up
[2:39:27] that these two old people
[2:39:30] got a body change
[2:39:32] [Music]
[2:39:33] [Applause]
[2:39:46] because you're people of the open book
[2:39:49] [Applause]
[2:39:49] [Music]
[2:39:51] and so the promise that was for them
[2:39:54] is for you
[2:39:56] [Applause]
[2:40:01] now
[2:40:03] i want to take you on just a little
[2:40:04] journey and i won't be long now
[2:40:08] but brother branham describes that
[2:40:11] abraham
[2:40:14] got out of his place
[2:40:18] and he backslid
[2:40:21] after all of these
[2:40:24] processes of god taking him through it
[2:40:27] god had a plan
[2:40:32] he had a plan
[2:40:34] and so
[2:40:36] and so there comes a famine
[2:40:38] and we all want the easy way
[2:40:43] and so they begin to move
[2:40:47] somewhere between the visitation of
[2:40:49] melchizedek
[2:40:51] we're not going to try to
[2:40:53] be some kind of brain here and figure
[2:40:54] out exactly what day it happened but
[2:40:56] somewhere between
[2:40:59] melchizedek's visit
[2:41:01] and his promise
[2:41:03] [Applause]
[2:41:06] and them getting to a place called greer
[2:41:12] can you imagine
[2:41:13] being the neighbor
[2:41:18] [Music]
[2:41:21] be in the next 10 over
[2:41:25] and they have been given testimony maybe
[2:41:28] you know like we do we want to give
[2:41:29] testimony of what god's doing and they
[2:41:31] became a testimony
[2:41:33] god's been with us all this time and
[2:41:35] he's promised us we're going to have a
[2:41:37] baby and they maybe have watched them
[2:41:40] set up the kin
[2:41:41] have the fire have the supper have all
[2:41:44] of those things and an old man goes in
[2:41:47] with this with his back over
[2:41:52] an old lady kind of scoots along
[2:41:57] and she makes her way into tent
[2:42:01] [Music]
[2:42:04] and the next morning
[2:42:11] [Applause]
[2:42:17] they walk out
[2:42:21] yeah baby
[2:42:28] the message was real
[2:42:30] [Applause]
[2:42:34] i'm one of them i'm one of them
[2:42:37] i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them
[2:42:40] [Music]
[2:42:40] [Applause]
[2:42:41] and you start seeing loved ones walk
[2:42:43] down your your
[2:42:45] your walkway
[2:42:47] knock on your door let them in
[2:42:49] [Music]
[2:42:50] [Applause]
[2:42:54] the mass you lived in yesterday is not
[2:42:58] that mess today
[2:43:00] [Applause]
[2:43:03] the backache
[2:43:04] the headaches
[2:43:07] well help me preach you know where i'm
[2:43:09] at
[2:43:10] once we get a certain age we don't talk
[2:43:12] about politics no more we talk about the
[2:43:14] medicine we take
[2:43:20] but there comes a time
[2:43:23] where that mass is over with
[2:43:38] now i want to just capture every one of
[2:43:40] you now
[2:43:41] if i can
[2:43:45] they're on a journey
[2:43:46] all this is happening
[2:43:48] god's watching this
[2:43:51] because he's got a plan
[2:43:57] because he needs a prophet at the end
[2:43:59] time
[2:44:00] to be able to look into the scriptures
[2:44:05] of things that he has hid
[2:44:07] and let that prophet's eyes fall on a
[2:44:10] certain scripture
[2:44:17] it was more than just the just shall
[2:44:18] live by faith
[2:44:27] and a king
[2:44:28] that was a righteous man
[2:44:31] an extremely large kingdom
[2:44:35] is looking for a wife
[2:44:37] and of all the kingdom
[2:44:41] of all the kingdom
[2:44:44] he comes out and he sees
[2:44:47] abraham and sarah
[2:44:57] abraham tells because of his backslidden
[2:45:00] lying nature now
[2:45:02] he tells his wife his half-sister
[2:45:06] tell the man that
[2:45:08] you're my sister
[2:45:11] listen your choices will now spiral
[2:45:15] it won't be much longer your choices
[2:45:18] will spiral now
[2:45:22] it will go way out of your control
[2:45:25] because brother branham said that king
[2:45:28] said i'll take her from my wife
[2:45:33] now here's what the prophet said you can
[2:45:35] read it for yourself said the king
[2:45:37] brought her in
[2:45:39] he painted her up he put all kind of a
[2:45:42] jewelry on her
[2:45:46] that's what the world will do for you
[2:45:53] because now she's in the different hands
[2:45:58] [Applause]
[2:45:59] and the king declares tomorrow
[2:46:02] think of the timeline tomorrow i'll
[2:46:04] marry her
[2:46:06] [Music]
[2:46:08] i want you to think you can have all
[2:46:09] your quotes you want now but now abraham
[2:46:14] has walked with god all of this length
[2:46:16] of time
[2:46:19] god's changed his name
[2:46:21] he's given him everything he's told him
[2:46:23] to look at the stars he's told him to
[2:46:25] look at the sand so shall thy seed be
[2:46:28] but because of bad choices
[2:46:37] i personally don't believe abraham went
[2:46:39] to bed
[2:46:43] i don't believe he went to bed
[2:46:53] can you imagine the thought
[2:46:56] of i made choices and let god down
[2:47:03] i more than know that i'm on target
[2:47:06] there's people that are sitting here
[2:47:07] that are living in a mess
[2:47:12] you need a revival in your life
[2:47:18] i may never get to preach to you again
[2:47:22] but i want to preach to you now
[2:47:24] [Music]
[2:47:31] you've got off target
[2:47:32] you've lost your focus
[2:47:35] you're laying in the darkness
[2:47:40] another king has got your wife
[2:47:44] the wife of promise
[2:47:46] the wife that has been turned young
[2:47:48] again
[2:47:50] the wife that is now so beautiful to a
[2:47:52] king has rejected all the women in his
[2:47:55] land and now picked your wife
[2:47:59] [Applause]
[2:48:00] [Music]
[2:48:05] i'll make an incredible statement here
[2:48:07] you've come to a spot there's nothing
[2:48:10] you
[2:48:12] can do about it
[2:48:22] do you think he prayed
[2:48:31] you hear brother random talk about that
[2:48:32] vision
[2:48:34] of the bride coming and he saw all those
[2:48:37] wicked looking women
[2:48:39] is this what it's produced
[2:48:44] imagine how disappointed he felt that
[2:48:46] moment but god had a plan
[2:48:50] [Music]
[2:48:54] young people maybe you've made some
[2:48:56] choices
[2:48:58] you heard last night maybe tonight is
[2:49:00] your first service
[2:49:03] sometimes we want to avoid the new birth
[2:49:07] we don't want to die out to our nature
[2:49:10] we want to go to church but we want our
[2:49:12] friends
[2:49:14] we want our drinking buddies we want our
[2:49:16] associates we want our friends we want
[2:49:18] our whatever on facebook
[2:49:22] we want all of those things attached we
[2:49:24] really don't want to give our whole life
[2:49:31] as much as me and these ministers here
[2:49:33] would love to be able to give it to you
[2:49:36] brother branham couldn't give it to his
[2:49:37] own children
[2:49:40] he couldn't give it to his own children
[2:49:43] why as a matter of fact he couldn't give
[2:49:44] it to his own self
[2:49:50] every one of us needed to be born again
[2:49:54] [Applause]
[2:49:56] whether it's a pink hospital bed or a
[2:49:59] hot pin
[2:50:00] it's a mess
[2:50:09] and i'm not talking about making a few
[2:50:11] vowels
[2:50:12] saying i'm going to come to church
[2:50:17] i'm talking about a real dying out
[2:50:21] i'm sorry to hear that so many pulpits
[2:50:23] are wanting to go away from a real holy
[2:50:26] ghost birth
[2:50:29] [Music]
[2:50:30] but listen there's one feeling but
[2:50:32] there's many refillings
[2:50:34] [Applause]
[2:50:35] [Music]
[2:50:36] i'm afraid we've lost the art of prayer
[2:50:41] where that we break through
[2:50:44] and i'm talking about even us gray heads
[2:50:47] we still need to break through
[2:50:50] [Music]
[2:50:54] brother on we watch your services and
[2:50:56] you guys are way too emotional
[2:51:02] just get what we got
[2:51:05] [Applause]
[2:51:23] i'm afraid
[2:51:24] as we heard brother timothy today say
[2:51:27] we take on a learned behavior
[2:51:32] and a learned behavior will only take
[2:51:33] you so far
[2:51:35] [Music]
[2:51:36] i'm sorry i went too long
[2:51:38] but let me just say this you the enemy
[2:51:40] that you drove out comes back
[2:51:44] the enemy that you asked to leave all of
[2:51:46] a sudden comes back
[2:51:48] and the spider web gets bigger and
[2:51:50] bigger
[2:51:51] until you're entangled in a trap
[2:51:54] let me just say this to you your enemy
[2:51:56] wants to set a trap for you
[2:52:02] especially if he thinks you
[2:52:05] could have the potential
[2:52:15] of being a devil destroyer
[2:52:20] [Applause]
[2:52:22] so he will take the weakness of your
[2:52:24] father your grandfather your
[2:52:25] great-grandfather and they have had the
[2:52:27] new birth and maybe before you ever were
[2:52:29] born but satan remembers their struggles
[2:52:32] and so he reaches back and he goes back
[2:52:35] into that old nature and begins to pull
[2:52:38] what made them fall what made them
[2:52:39] strain what made them go through things
[2:52:41] and all of a sudden it begins to come
[2:52:43] forward and now it's coming in your life
[2:52:45] and a spirit begins to move
[2:52:49] and you find yourself with the wrong
[2:52:50] kind of friends you find yourself
[2:52:57] you find yourself in habits
[2:53:02] you looked at the wrong side
[2:53:04] now you're with the prostitute
[2:53:07] [Music]
[2:53:10] now your marriage is broke up
[2:53:12] you're in a mess
[2:53:14] [Music]
[2:53:18] and too many people sit in messes
[2:53:21] even around our churches
[2:53:24] [Music]
[2:53:34] we're just hoping some
[2:53:36] preacher
[2:53:37] will concoct something in the lab
[2:53:45] to give us enough grace to stay in
[2:53:47] church
[2:53:50] because of the mess
[2:53:52] listen if this ain't for you send it to
[2:53:54] somebody that it's for
[2:54:02] wayne lawson was we were standing
[2:54:05] at a
[2:54:07] we were standing at a uh
[2:54:12] national park
[2:54:14] we're standing on a bridge
[2:54:20] and we're standing there as there's a
[2:54:22] a wildlife agent standing there
[2:54:26] he said brother ron he said right there
[2:54:27] is where a puts his foot every
[2:54:30] every time right there see in that sand
[2:54:32] he said no there ain't no spots around
[2:54:34] that it's where he puts his foot
[2:54:37] and he will do that for years he'll put
[2:54:39] his foot right there
[2:54:41] he said now if you want to catch him let
[2:54:43] me know he's your buddy
[2:54:45] he said if you want to catch him
[2:54:47] he said you'll find a place where that
[2:54:49] that animal puts his foot
[2:54:51] every time
[2:54:54] he said that's the way the devil will do
[2:54:56] for you
[2:54:58] he'll watch you for decades
[2:55:03] and he'll watch where you put your foot
[2:55:07] and maybe you like samson will get by
[2:55:09] for a long time but after a while you're
[2:55:12] working at a meal
[2:55:15] and there's people spitting on you and
[2:55:17] making fun of you
[2:55:23] but he just kept pushing
[2:55:27] it was all out of abraham's hands
[2:55:31] it was completely out of his hands
[2:55:34] but god had a plan
[2:55:39] you see
[2:55:41] christ was going to come through the
[2:55:44] lineage
[2:55:45] of sarah
[2:55:50] and he was not going to let the king
[2:55:53] of this world
[2:55:55] mess it up
[2:55:57] [Applause]
[2:55:58] no matter how powerful he was
[2:56:03] and he knew abraham couldn't fix it on
[2:56:06] his own
[2:56:07] so he came himself
[2:56:10] [Applause]
[2:56:17] that's what he's done in this service
[2:56:19] he's came himself
[2:56:22] he's been working on this meeting for
[2:56:24] months because he knows what you're in
[2:56:27] and he's wanting to tell you i've come
[2:56:29] to deliver you
[2:56:30] [Applause]
[2:56:35] i've taken your case
[2:56:38] i am the judge and the jury i am your
[2:56:41] attorney i've got it all in my hands
[2:56:47] when everybody else gave up on you
[2:56:50] i got you
[2:56:52] [Applause]
[2:56:58] [Music]
[2:57:06] the woman that you're going to marry
[2:57:10] is a prophet's wife
[2:57:16] the man that's
[2:57:18] that was with her that's her husband
[2:57:25] and hamilton no doubt said he lied
[2:57:30] if you take her to be your wife
[2:57:35] i'm going to destroy your entire kingdom
[2:57:37] i'm going to shut up the wombs of every
[2:57:39] woman in this complete country
[2:57:43] i'm going to destroy you

[2:58:01] restore the man his wife and get him to
[2:58:05] pray for you
[2:58:07] [Applause]
[2:58:10] think about the grace of god
[2:58:13] god overlooked
[2:58:15] [Applause]
[2:58:19] he overlooked him getting out of his way
[2:58:21] he looked overlooked and coming to grier
[2:58:30] and god said i'm going to take this
[2:58:32] and i'm going to hide this
[2:58:36] i'm going to hide abraham's mistake
[2:58:40] i'm going to hide it
[2:58:42] that's what he does with your mistakes
[2:58:45] [Applause]
[2:58:47] he puts it where the devil can't get to
[2:58:49] it no more i'm gonna put it in my blood
[2:58:53] and there's not a devil in hell can find
[2:58:55] it
[2:58:57] i can't even find it for myself
[2:59:01] [Applause]
[2:59:11] when he was talking about restore the
[2:59:12] man his wife he was talking about this
[2:59:15] is my bride

[2:59:19] and satan you can't have her
[2:59:22] you can't have her you've done
[2:59:25] everything you can to destroy her and to
[2:59:27] pull her in but i got a title deed to
[2:59:30] her

[2:59:35] life

[2:59:40] [Applause]
[2:59:42] [Music]
[2:59:53] when the judgment hammer was ready to
[2:59:55] fall on you
