[34:48] God bless you all how many is happy to
[34:49] be here another year for a youth service
[34:51] for special meetings this has been a
[34:53] special part of the year every year I
[34:56] feel like in the special meetings that
[34:57] would come this little song is come on
[34:59] my heart that I I just I don't even know
[35:01] it very well so if I mess it up forgive
[35:03] me but
[35:05] it struck me last night in the service
[35:07] as well as the brother was preaching
[35:08] that I don't know if I have a full
[35:10] revelation of something that we
[35:13] recognize that we are forgiven of our
[35:14] sins I can look at my own life and see
[35:16] my past and it's almost like I recognize
[35:19] God forgive my sins but do I truly
[35:21] recognize that he forgot them that it's
[35:24] actually it's not that he just looks at
[35:26] and says I know and I forgive you but
[35:27] it's actually gone
[35:29] I don't think I even fully catch a
[35:31] picture of that it's my past is actually
[35:34] gone
[35:35] but may we catch more of a picture
[35:38] it happened so long ago
[35:42] and I cried out for Mercy back then
[35:47] I bet the blood of Jesus
[35:50] begged him to forgive my sin but I still
[35:56] can't forget it
[35:58] it just won't go away
[36:02] so I wept again Lord wash my sin but
[36:06] this is all he said
[36:13] what's in
[36:16] [Music]
[36:17] what's in that's as far away as the East
[36:22] is from the West
[36:28] oh what's in
[36:31] [Music]
[36:32] what's in it was gone
[36:36] the very minute you can fast
[36:43] buried in the
[36:45] sea of forgetfulness
[36:50] [Music]
[36:54] yeah
[36:56] the heaviest thing you'll carry is a
[37:00] lord of guilt and shame
[37:04] you were never meant to Bear them so let
[37:08] them go in Jesus name our God is slow to
[37:13] anger
[37:15] quick to forgive our sins
[37:18] to put it under the blood and don't
[37:23] bring them up again and you'll hear him
[37:26] saying

[51:31] nobody can take your place
[51:33] amen you're here this is your moment
[51:36] this is your time not just this service
[51:38] but this season this age this era amen
[51:41] with this word uh you're indispensable
[51:44] to God Amen and as we Minister uh this
[51:48] afternoon I hope that that will become
[51:50] something a little more clearer to you
[51:52] by the help of the Lord let's turn to
[51:54] First Corinthians the 12th chapter
[51:56] and verse 18.
[52:06] amen and this is a little bit of part
[52:09] two
[52:09] uh to to Thursday
[52:12] evening and um
[52:16] I'd like to title it God's economy
[52:19] God's economy maybe a phrase that you've
[52:21] heard before
[52:23] but whether you know it or not you're a
[52:25] part
[52:26] of God's economy
[52:29] First Corinthians chapter 12 will start
[52:30] at verse 18.
[52:37] the Bible says but now have God set the
[52:39] members every one of them in the body as
[52:42] it hath pleased him
[52:44] and if they were all one member then
[52:47] where were the body in other words if we
[52:48] were all an eye if we were all if we
[52:51] were all a hand if we were all afoot it
[52:52] wouldn't be much of a body would it
[52:54] amen if the whole body was an eye where
[52:56] were the hearing and if the whole we're
[52:58] hearing where were the smelling but now
[53:00] hath God set the members every one of
[53:02] them in the body as it hath pleased who
[53:05] him
[53:07] and if they were all one member where
[53:09] were the body but now are they many
[53:11] members
[53:12] but one body
[53:14] and the eye cannot say unto the hand I
[53:16] have no need of thee nor again the head
[53:18] to the feet I have no need of you nay
[53:20] much more those members of the body
[53:22] which seem to be more feeble
[53:24] are necessary
[53:27] and those members of the body which we
[53:28] think to be less honorable upon these we
[53:30] bestow more abundant honor and our
[53:33] uncomely parts have more abundant
[53:34] comeliness
[53:35] for our company parts have no need but
[53:37] God hath tempered the body together
[53:39] having given more abundant honor to that
[53:42] parchment which lacked that there should
[53:45] be no Schism in the body but that the
[53:46] members should have the same care
[53:49] one for another amen what a beautiful
[53:51] what a beautiful type there could we
[53:53] also take Ephesians chapter 3 before we
[53:55] pray and have you seated
[53:57] and here's where I'm going to take my
[53:58] text
[54:00] Ephesians 3 verses 8 and 9.
[54:03] I'll try not to keep you long today I
[54:06] try to preach the message of the hour
[54:08] not the message of the hour and a half
[54:10] or you know so we want to respect your
[54:14] time and and make make sure we have
[54:16] plenty energy for the service this
[54:17] evening but how many want to take
[54:19] advantage of this time
[54:21] amen this is the one service this
[54:23] weekend that's specifically for you as
[54:25] young people let's take advantage of it
[54:28] Ephesians chapter 3 verses 8 and 9 he
[54:30] says unto me who am less than the least
[54:33] of All Saints is this Grace given that I
[54:36] should preach among the Gentiles The
[54:38] unsearchable Riches of Christ
[54:41] and to make all men see what is the
[54:43] Fellowship of the mystery which from the
[54:45] beginning of the world hath been hidden
[54:48] God who created All Things by Christ by
[54:51] Jesus Christ we were preaching Thursday
[54:52] on this mystery this mystery God having
[54:56] these secret attributes in his thoughts
[54:58] before the foundation of the world and
[54:59] you were one of those thoughts but now
[55:01] we're having Fellowship Paul says with
[55:04] the mystery and that Fellowship uh it is
[55:07] sometimes translated as economy
[55:10] and because it's an interchange it's an
[55:12] interaction it's a group thing
[55:14] amen and so that's where we get this
[55:17] phrase God's economy that we've heard
[55:18] before it comes from this scripture amen
[55:21] can we have a word of Prayer
[55:23] and let me just ask you if you'd just be
[55:25] uh willing
[55:28] to make known if you have a very I mean
[55:31] specific this afternoon something
[55:34] specific in your heart something a real
[55:37] a need
[55:38] amen an exact and a specific need
[55:40] something that uh something you're
[55:42] looking for to gain out of this service
[55:44] would you raise it to him as we pray
[55:46] amen be intent be and be specific
[55:49] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[55:51] the Revelation that we have in this day
[55:53] of this mystery Lord and just to realize
[55:55] that we all have a part in this thing
[55:58] Lord there's no big eyes and little use
[56:00] Lord in the kingdom of God but we are
[56:02] all a part of your economy Lord and
[56:04] these young people that are gathered
[56:05] before me Lord many of them because of
[56:08] the complexes of Youth Lord because of
[56:10] the things that the our society is
[56:12] projected onto them Lord and the
[56:14] environment that they're raised up in
[56:15] Lord and the persecution of the church
[56:17] Lord all these different factors Lord
[56:19] there are many people like young people
[56:21] Lord that are gathered here to this
[56:23] afternoon and Lord that do not recognize
[56:26] how valuable they are to you Lord and
[56:28] when I look at these young people Lord
[56:30] my heart just swells because they mean
[56:32] so much to me Lord and in my eyes they
[56:35] have such value in my eyes they have
[56:36] such potential Lord but Lord that that
[56:39] couldn't touch Lord what they are to you
[56:41] father when you look at them you see
[56:44] your children Lord you don't just see a
[56:45] young man you don't just see a young
[56:47] woman you don't see somebody lesser or
[56:49] inferior Lord but you see somebody that
[56:51] you predestinated in yourself before the
[56:53] foundation of the world and you Rose
[56:54] them up Lord for a very special purpose
[56:57] in this day and Lord as we would just
[56:59] labor to preach your word father I'm
[57:01] just trusting in your anointing Lord you
[57:04] would help Lord and may we all get out
[57:06] of the way father so you could say
[57:07] exactly what you want to say to these
[57:09] young people and Lord may it be edifying
[57:11] I pray and may we have your leadership
[57:13] Lord may you just move in a special way
[57:15] amongst us Lord you would change lives
[57:18] change attitudes Lord and change the
[57:20] narrative Lord in each heart I pray in
[57:23] the name of Jesus Christ we just
[57:25] dedicate ourselves to you amen God bless
[57:28] you as you're seated today
[57:29] amen preaching about the Fellowship of
[57:32] the mystery the economy of the mystery
[57:35] and you know if you miss Thursday and
[57:37] that's all right if you if you if you
[57:39] don't have the recap here but uh but we
[57:41] were preaching a little bit about how
[57:43] brother Brown taught on God and morphe
[57:45] which means god expressing himself
[57:48] through a form like a mask and and this
[57:51] is how God works as he is down Through
[57:53] the Ages he God never changes he the way
[57:56] that he thinks and the you know his his
[57:58] heart his his thoughts they never change
[58:00] but yet he changes his mask from time to
[58:03] time and season and to season so that he
[58:06] can reveal more about himself because he
[58:08] desires that God actually wants that God
[58:11] wants to reveal himself amen not just to
[58:13] churches and peoples and Nations those
[58:15] times have come and they've gone but
[58:17] today brother Bram said the message is
[58:19] to an individual and so so so you know
[58:22] if you couldn't uh if you weren't there
[58:25] Thursday or or maybe you can't wrap your
[58:27] mind around it but the core of the
[58:28] message that that I just want to set
[58:30] here as the foundation is that God
[58:32] desires a personal fellowship with you
[58:35] God desires to reveal himself not just
[58:38] to your pastor not just to your parents
[58:40] not just to your fellow church members
[58:41] or your church as a body but God desires
[58:44] young people in this day in this year in
[58:47] this time amen that he can reveal
[58:49] himself to personally amen and then by
[58:52] that Revelation they could know who he
[58:54] is and he could come a little lower than
[58:56] he was yesterday to step into the life
[58:59] of a young man or step into the life of
[59:01] a young woman and make you his mask for
[59:03] this day amen so he can reveal something
[59:06] about the mystery within himself amen of
[59:08] which you are apart you are a part of
[59:10] the mystery of God brother Brown said
[59:13] before the foundation of the world he
[59:14] thought about you and if he thought
[59:15] about you then amen then he thought
[59:18] about you always for eternity because
[59:19] God is eternal and his thoughts are
[59:22] Eternal and so if you have a part in him
[59:24] amen you're never in danger of losing it
[59:27] amen nobody will ever pluck you out of
[59:29] his hand because as you belong to him
[59:31] amen you are important you you have a
[59:34] value to him and so and so we have a
[59:36] fellowship with this mystery this
[59:38] mystery that I'm talking about is the
[59:39] mystery of God but it's being revealed
[59:42] amen it was revealed in Jesus Christ but
[59:44] it's also revealed in your personal
[59:46] individual life amen and so you as a
[59:49] mask for this word you're giving life to
[59:52] the mysterious purpose that he had in
[59:55] his mind before the foundation of the
[59:57] world you say me brother Nathan you are
[59:59] giving life to the mystery to the
[1:00:01] purpose to what he had in his heart
[1:00:03] before the foundation of the world you
[1:00:05] have to do with it you're a part of it
[1:00:06] you're a part of God's economy and that
[1:00:08] makes you as an individual now as a
[1:00:11] church you're very important to us
[1:00:12] because of the ministry of brother Ed
[1:00:14] and and the precious families that are
[1:00:16] here and the legacy of brother Harold
[1:00:18] you're important to us as a church back
[1:00:20] there in Ohio but that's not what I'm
[1:00:22] talking about I'm talking about you as
[1:00:24] an individual amen whatever church that
[1:00:26] you belong to wherever you've come from
[1:00:28] whatever family you were raised up in
[1:00:30] you are very special you are very
[1:00:33] important because this mystery is an
[1:00:36] economy amen and you you know what an
[1:00:39] economy is we live in an economy it's a
[1:00:41] it's part of human nature to have you
[1:00:43] know economy where there's trade and
[1:00:45] there's interaction and you know you
[1:00:47] don't just live in your house and and
[1:00:48] eat everything that grows up in your
[1:00:50] backyard and you know you know you
[1:00:52] didn't you didn't build your own car out
[1:00:53] of the iron that was in your soil
[1:00:55] there's got to be an economy right amen
[1:00:57] somebody's got to provide the iron
[1:00:59] somebody's got to provide the food and
[1:01:00] somebody's got to provide the services
[1:01:02] somebody's got to provide the work and
[1:01:04] the labor everybody's got to provide
[1:01:06] amen and the only way you could survive
[1:01:08] you can't even live in this world
[1:01:10] without taking part in the economy right
[1:01:14] amen so what I want to what I want to
[1:01:16] preach you in God's economy is is to
[1:01:18] make you think about it this way
[1:01:19] participation is not an option
[1:01:23] it is not an option you don't get to sit
[1:01:25] in your hands amen and just just be a
[1:01:28] consumer amen and just have everything
[1:01:30] come to you amen the world that we live
[1:01:32] in in the naturally speaking it's an
[1:01:34] economy you have to participate amen but
[1:01:37] in God's economy it's the same brother
[1:01:39] sister spiritually speaking you don't
[1:01:41] get to just come to this message and
[1:01:43] just be a church member and just warm up
[1:01:45] you and just just sit there and and
[1:01:47] consume and take everything in but God
[1:01:49] has called you even as a young person
[1:01:51] even in this season of your life amen
[1:01:54] God has raised you up to take part in
[1:01:56] the economy of the revelation of the
[1:01:59] mystery of God
[1:02:01] amen you're very very important the
[1:02:03] thing doesn't run without you Hallelujah
[1:02:06] participation is not an option
[1:02:09] amen you got to realize who you are
[1:02:11] brother Branham said you you somebody
[1:02:13] say me somebody say I
[1:02:16] I was a son or daughter of God before
[1:02:18] there even was a moon stars or a
[1:02:22] molecule you believe that about yourself
[1:02:24] that's what a prophet said you were Sons
[1:02:27] and Daughters of God for you are only
[1:02:29] the physical manifestation of the
[1:02:32] attributes that were in God at the
[1:02:34] beginning
[1:02:35] amen for there's only one form of
[1:02:37] eternal life and he said that was you
[1:02:39] before amen I love that word before
[1:02:42] because you know we go through things as
[1:02:44] young people and we get into
[1:02:45] circumstances of our life and you know
[1:02:46] we get to we have a certain spiritual
[1:02:48] temperature and we've got struggles
[1:02:49] we've got problems and and it's hard to
[1:02:51] get our minds out of the moment but
[1:02:53] brother Bram said don't look at the
[1:02:54] moment but think about before amen
[1:02:56] because before you ever made a mistake
[1:02:58] before you ever fail in a snare before
[1:03:01] you ever ran into trouble you are a son
[1:03:03] you are a daughter of God you're older
[1:03:06] than the molecules of this Earth amen
[1:03:08] you came out of his mind you're The
[1:03:10] Offspring of Jehovah you're the birthing
[1:03:12] of his loins amen you young person you
[1:03:16] young man you young woman
[1:03:18] are a son or daughter of God an eternal
[1:03:20] seed your eternal life you were in in
[1:03:23] the image of God you were made and you
[1:03:25] were manifested you were manifested you
[1:03:28] were manifested for the glory and The
[1:03:31] Fellowship Of God Amen
[1:03:34] and therefore as sure as your Gene had
[1:03:36] to be in your father before your natural
[1:03:38] birth your spiritual Gene had to be in
[1:03:40] God because you are an expression of the
[1:03:43] attributes of his thoughts before the
[1:03:45] foundation of the world brother bran
[1:03:46] says right he says no way around it
[1:03:51] come on young people there's no way
[1:03:53] around this thing amen you might spend
[1:03:56] like I did you might spend about 20
[1:03:57] years being raised up in a message
[1:03:59] Church you might have come out of a
[1:04:00] message family maybe your grandpa's a
[1:04:02] pastor maybe your daddy's a deacon your
[1:04:05] mom's a Church musician and you got you
[1:04:07] got that kind of a yeah of a pedigree
[1:04:09] amen but that doesn't do you any good in
[1:04:11] God's economy amen because there hasn't
[1:04:13] come a day there's no way around it
[1:04:15] there's no substitute for it you got to
[1:04:18] come to a personal experience a personal
[1:04:20] revelation of Jesus Christ not to your
[1:04:23] church not to your family to you as an
[1:04:25] individual amen you got to know where
[1:04:28] you stand with God you got to know that
[1:04:30] you were in his mind before the
[1:04:31] foundation of the world God wants to
[1:04:33] reveal that to you amen if that's
[1:04:35] something you desire it's not withheld
[1:04:37] from you it's what God is trying to get
[1:04:39] across to young people in this day
[1:04:41] amen God doesn't have any grandchildren
[1:04:43] he's looking for a young man or a young
[1:04:45] woman to rise up and say I'll be a part
[1:04:47] of God's economy I'll be part of the
[1:04:49] fellowship of this mystery there's no
[1:04:52] way around it friends if you were in the
[1:04:53] mind of God you have to be a part of the
[1:04:55] unveiling you got to be a part of the
[1:04:57] word for this day you've got to be part
[1:04:58] of this Revelation you've got to be part
[1:05:00] of this
[1:05:01] you have to be because see the seventh
[1:05:04] angel message reveals the whole mystery
[1:05:08] the whole mystery when we talk about the
[1:05:10] the whole mystery of God being revealed
[1:05:12] we're not just talking about the Seven
[1:05:13] Seals and the church ages and the third
[1:05:15] poll amen and water baptism and the
[1:05:17] revelation of the godhead and all those
[1:05:19] things I'm talking about individuals
[1:05:21] amen it's got to be revealed friends and
[1:05:24] that's exactly where we're living as
[1:05:26] we're preaching on Thursday it's the big
[1:05:27] reveal amen this great drama has come to
[1:05:30] a crescendo it's come to the very climax
[1:05:32] of this story and God has taken his mask
[1:05:35] off amen and showed hey this is not just
[1:05:37] a church this is not just a
[1:05:39] denominational system this is not just a
[1:05:41] social Gathering amen this is Christ
[1:05:44] revealing himself Amen in a many-member
[1:05:46] bride and that means that means older
[1:05:49] ones that means mothers and fathers and
[1:05:51] ministers and pastors but that means
[1:05:53] young men and young women with lives
[1:05:56] that are burning with this message
[1:05:57] burning with the Zeal of this word
[1:05:59] saying nobody can take my part amen
[1:06:02] don't let anybody despise my youth I'm
[1:06:05] part of this mystery I'm part of this
[1:06:07] message
[1:06:09] nobody can take your place friends amen
[1:06:12] that's what I that's all I'm trying to
[1:06:13] tell you this afternoon amen every
[1:06:15] single attribute under this message
[1:06:17] under this seventh angel sounding every
[1:06:19] attribute has to be revealed everything
[1:06:21] has to be expressed this is Harvest Time
[1:06:23] manifesting time everything has to put
[1:06:26] forth fruit and prove what it is one way
[1:06:28] or the other friends there's no way
[1:06:30] around it you you it's going to be
[1:06:32] revealed out of your life what seed is
[1:06:34] in you
[1:06:35] 've got a part in this thing
[1:06:37] Hallelujah brother Bram said the lamb he
[1:06:40] talks about the lamb and the time of
[1:06:41] intercession amen the lamb how Jesus
[1:06:43] died you ever wonder why well Jesus died
[1:06:45] and he paid for all of our sins so what
[1:06:47] are we doing here
[1:06:48] 2000 years later
[1:06:50] what's the whole thing about why are we
[1:06:52] here he paid he came and he paid for our
[1:06:54] sins
[1:06:55] you know and he paid the price of
[1:06:57] Redemption how come we didn't all just
[1:06:58] go to heaven then
[1:06:59] because there was more mystery
[1:07:01] there was more attributes there were
[1:07:03] more things in his heart that had to be
[1:07:05] revealed and so he's laying there in a
[1:07:07] part of an intercessor he's on that
[1:07:09] Mercy Seat pleading out amen and he says
[1:07:11] as long he said the reason why is that
[1:07:14] he knew that there were names in there
[1:07:16] that were put there before the
[1:07:18] foundation of the world now you got to
[1:07:20] put your name here brother sister he
[1:07:22] said and as long as those names have
[1:07:24] never been manifested on Earth as yet he
[1:07:27] had to stay there as an intercessor a
[1:07:29] glory to God friends amen he couldn't we
[1:07:32] he couldn't take everybody to Heaven two
[1:07:34] thousand years ago the Rapture couldn't
[1:07:36] come in 1977 why because there was
[1:07:38] another name on the book
[1:07:41] amen and the blood of Jesus Christ is in
[1:07:43] effect generation after generation it's
[1:07:46] never too late as long as there's a name
[1:07:48] on his book amen he won't lose a one of
[1:07:51] them
[1:07:52] he won't lose you he'll find you he'll
[1:07:54] Quicken you he'll bring you into the
[1:07:56] fold
[1:07:57] Hallelujah he won't fail to do it
[1:07:59] brother Graham said as long as there was
[1:08:01] one name
[1:08:03] for the sake of one name amen that had
[1:08:06] never been declared in the earth Christ
[1:08:08] had to stay as an intercessor to take

[1:08:38] watch over his that name he'll watch
[1:08:40] over your name why because it's his name
[1:08:43] it's his reputation
[1:08:45] amen what kind of a Good Shepherd would
[1:08:47] he be if he could lose one of his Sheep
[1:08:48] amen the problem we have as young people
[1:08:50] we have far too much fear about where we
[1:08:52] stand with God and what I'm trying to
[1:08:54] preach to you amen is that God didn't
[1:08:56] choose you on the basis of what a good
[1:08:59] Christian life that you live amen how
[1:09:02] good a boy or how good a girl that
[1:09:03] you've been amen is not what earned you
[1:09:05] into his presence amen you didn't work
[1:09:07] your way into this thing you weren't
[1:09:09] taught into this thing amen you didn't
[1:09:11] study your way into this thing amen but
[1:09:13] it was the grace of God
[1:09:15] that elected you amen he looked at you
[1:09:18] amen and he chose you amen he chose
[1:09:21] other people but he chose you on that
[1:09:23] same level
[1:09:25] he said this one amen this name
[1:09:28] is going on my book
[1:09:30] and nobody will ever take it off
[1:09:33] Hallelujah he's taking care of your name
[1:09:35] this is not this message is not just

[1:09:47] you got good family you got good
[1:09:48] Ministry you got you got good leadership
[1:09:50] amen but that but it's more than that
[1:09:53] friends it's not about having your name
[1:09:54] on the book amen but it's by knowing by
[1:09:56] a personal revelation that your name's
[1:09:59] on his book
[1:10:00] Hallelujah that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:10:02] has sent amen it's a token unto you amen
[1:10:05] that's why you got to be born again you
[1:10:06] got to have the Holy Ghost on the inside
[1:10:08] where his Spirit Bears witness with your
[1:10:10] spirit that says I'm a Son of God I'm a
[1:10:13] daughter of God my name is on his book
[1:10:16] if that's not a reality to you it can be
[1:10:20] it can be you don't have to leave this
[1:10:22] meeting this afternoon amen without a
[1:10:25] solid sure personal revelation that you
[1:10:28] are a son or a daughter of God with
[1:10:32] eternal security
[1:10:33] Hallelujah you got to have a revelation
[1:10:36] that your name's on his book hey man
[1:10:38] because if your name's on the book of of
[1:10:40] end time message Tabernacle that only
[1:10:41] goes so far amen and it ain't far enough
[1:10:44] it's not enough for me to know that I
[1:10:46] belong to true or Tabernacle and you
[1:10:48] know and and and I've sat under the
[1:10:50] ministry of Ray Erickson and Dwayne
[1:10:51] Lawson and I thank God for those things
[1:10:53] and God works through those things but
[1:10:55] my security amen my identity is not on
[1:10:59] the name of my church amen who are being
[1:11:01] associated with the name of William
[1:11:02] Branham you realize there's only one
[1:11:04] name given under Heaven whereby men may
[1:11:07] be saved amen and that's the name that
[1:11:09] he's watching over that's the name whose
[1:11:11] reputation he will defend amen is fear
[1:11:13] one of his if you're in Jesus Christ
[1:11:15] then you're called by his name amen
[1:11:18] you're identified with his attributes if
[1:11:20] he's righteous you're righteous if he's
[1:11:22] holy you're holy if he's good you're
[1:11:25] good if he's got power you've got power
[1:11:27] if he's an overcomer you're an overcomer
[1:11:31] not because of who you are or who you
[1:11:33] belong to but because you're part of him
[1:11:37] Hallelujah you're in God's economy
[1:11:41] amen a word what is a word it's a
[1:11:44] thought that has become expressed amen
[1:11:46] and we talk a lot you you've heard good
[1:11:48] teaching you've heard good Ministry and
[1:11:50] we talk a lot around this message about
[1:11:52] the word and the word the word we've got
[1:11:54] the word we believe the word amen God
[1:11:56] restored the word amen but what is the
[1:11:58] word friends amen it's got to be a
[1:12:00] little deeper than that you've got to
[1:12:01] realize you are the word
[1:12:04] amen because you were the thought of God
[1:12:06] that now has been expressed making you
[1:12:09] the spoken word of God Amen God didn't
[1:12:11] send a messenger to raise up a bunch of
[1:12:13] churches and build a new denomination
[1:12:15] but he sent a be sent an eagle screaming
[1:12:18] over a chicken yard amen so that
[1:12:20] somebody amen of a royal seed of a royal
[1:12:24] lineage somebody that belonged to him in
[1:12:26] the beginning would hear that prophet's
[1:12:28] voice and say that's my father's voice
[1:12:32] that's not just a words of a man
[1:12:34] amen
[1:12:36] Hallelujah
[1:12:38] I don't know what you think this message
[1:12:39] is young people maybe it's the lifestyle
[1:12:41] that you were raised under amen it's the
[1:12:43] tradition of your home it's the church
[1:12:45] that you belong to it's more than that
[1:12:48] it's a whole lot more than that there's
[1:12:50] deeper things in here for you than that
[1:12:52] amen that won't keep you that won't hold
[1:12:54] you that won't even give you peace it
[1:12:56] won't even give you Joy all you'll find
[1:12:58] in that level of thinking is a bunch of
[1:13:00] miserable religion amen but if you could
[1:13:03] ever hear this Eagle scream amen if you
[1:13:05] could ever hear your theophany speak to
[1:13:07] you out of this message amen it'll rock
[1:13:10] your world Amen it'll be a deep call
[1:13:13] that'll answer the deepest desire of
[1:13:14] your heart and will identify you say
[1:13:17] you're my child you came from me
[1:13:20] you matter
[1:13:22] you're important you're special you have
[1:13:26] value
[1:13:27] because you're part of my mystery and I
[1:13:30] have thought of you but now I have
[1:13:32] spoken to you and I have expressed into
[1:13:34] this age a group of young people amen
[1:13:37] that are called to overcome laodicea
[1:13:39] amen and take the very changing of the
[1:13:41] body
[1:13:43] notice brother bran said the word had to
[1:13:45] be manifested
[1:13:46] if you're if you were a thought you've
[1:13:48] got to become word you've got to become
[1:13:50] manifested Who You Are
[1:13:51] and when the word had to be manifested
[1:13:53] of a promise he said God always sends a
[1:13:56] prophet to manifest that promise because
[1:13:59] the word of the Lord comes to him right
[1:14:00] the word of the Lord comes to a prophet
[1:14:02] Moses was foreign for the purpose he was
[1:14:04] called to the job and no one else could
[1:14:06] do it
[1:14:08] no one else could do it and when God has
[1:14:10] called a person for a job to do there's
[1:14:13] no one that can take his or her place
[1:14:17] there is no one when God has called
[1:14:19] somebody there is nobody
[1:14:21] that can take their place
[1:14:23] now you're going to have to we hear
[1:14:25] these things a lot as young people but
[1:14:26] you got to really just let it settle in
[1:14:28] for a moment that there's nobody who can
[1:14:31] take my place God called me amen and I'm
[1:14:35] not interchangeable I am not dispensable
[1:14:38] I am not replaceable I am part of his
[1:14:42] purpose
[1:14:43] I am part of him Amen brother Brown said
[1:14:46] there is no one that can take your place
[1:14:50] amen there's no one that can take your
[1:14:52] place I like how he said it with your
[1:14:54] peculiarity
[1:14:57] now we're all peculiar people
[1:14:59] some of us more than others
[1:15:03] amen but see God God made you the way
[1:15:06] that you are in a peculiar way in a
[1:15:08] unique way on purpose
[1:15:11] it was on purpose oh my amen let's just
[1:15:14] read on he said there's no one could
[1:15:16] take your place with your peculiarity
[1:15:17] now brother man just begins to share
[1:15:20] personally from his own heart he says
[1:15:21] there's how often I've wondered he said
[1:15:23] I would have liked to take Oral Roberts
[1:15:25] place
[1:15:26] amen I would have liked to take Billy
[1:15:28] Graham's place or be somebody like that
[1:15:29] but he said I can't be Billy Graham
[1:15:32] but neither can Billy Graham be me I
[1:15:35] can't be Oral Roberts but Oral Roberts
[1:15:37] can't be me amen amen are you getting
[1:15:39] any young people he said you are each
[1:15:41] one set in God's economy just for its
[1:15:45] place one fast all the time and communes
[1:15:48] with God and another one casts out
[1:15:50] Devils amen because this one is fasting
[1:15:52] remember somebody came to brother
[1:15:53] Branham and they said brother Branham
[1:15:55] I've been fasting and I've been praying
[1:15:56] and I've been I've been putting in a lot
[1:15:58] of work I've been really making a lot of
[1:16:00] sacrifice and I still never cast out a
[1:16:02] devil you know so what's wrong with me
[1:16:04] because because what's happening in my
[1:16:05] life is not what's happening in your
[1:16:07] life brother Brandon brother Branham
[1:16:08] said you got it all wrong he said you're
[1:16:10] supposed to fast and pray so I can cast
[1:16:12] out the devils hey man so see see in
[1:16:15] God's economy you can't measure Yourself
[1:16:17] by somebody else
[1:16:18] amen you can't expect God to reveal
[1:16:21] something in your life that he's just
[1:16:23] just because it's being revealed in
[1:16:24] somebody else that's not why he raised
[1:16:26] you up amen if God needed another Nathan
[1:16:28] Erickson he already raised up on Nathan
[1:16:30] Erickson he already raised up an Andrew
[1:16:32] Dodd he already raised these ones up
[1:16:34] amen he doesn't need another Nathan he
[1:16:36] doesn't need another Andrew but he needs
[1:16:38] you
[1:16:39] he needs you amen because your
[1:16:41] peculiarity fits the very need that he
[1:16:43] had in his mind before the foundation of
[1:16:45] the world
[1:16:46] amen it's the whole body of Christ
[1:16:48] working together the unity the unity
[1:16:52] brother sister you are an authentic you
[1:16:55] are a one of a kind work a creation of
[1:16:59] God's expression you think you think
[1:17:00] well Nathan I'm not really anything
[1:17:02] special oh yes you are amen because the
[1:17:05] great artist of creation the one who
[1:17:07] painted every rainbow the one who
[1:17:08] painted the sunset amen the one who
[1:17:10] dotted the Stars up in the heavens amen
[1:17:13] as brother Ron preached he watched over
[1:17:15] your grandfather and your grandmother
[1:17:17] and every ancestor that you had and
[1:17:19] everything that ever happened in your
[1:17:21] life and everything that you've been
[1:17:22] through was God with the paintbrush of
[1:17:24] the artist amen painting you amen
[1:17:28] expressing you building you into what he
[1:17:31] wanted for his purpose for his glory for
[1:17:34] his for the need that he wanted to meet
[1:17:36] through your life
[1:17:38] through your life
[1:17:40] amen you got to accept that for yourself
[1:17:43] amen he does and here's the beautiful
[1:17:45] thing about God God doesn't do anything
[1:17:47] halfway
[1:17:48] brother bam said God doesn't make
[1:17:50] halfway Christians he doesn't make
[1:17:52] halfway preachers sometimes a preacher's
[1:17:54] halfway but God doesn't make halfway
[1:17:56] preachers halfway Christians halfway
[1:17:58] young people he doesn't do anything
[1:17:59] haphazard he makes all things beautiful
[1:18:01] in his time
[1:18:03] amen so you got to believe that about
[1:18:05] yourself amen that don't sell yourself
[1:18:07] short amen don't let the devil amen
[1:18:09] assign his value to you amen trust God's
[1:18:12] evaluation of you amen he said you're
[1:18:15] precious you're accepted in the Beloved
[1:18:18] you're a part of me you are my creation
[1:18:21] you are my word I thought about you I
[1:18:24] meditated over you I spoke you I
[1:18:27] expressed you I painted you I sculpted
[1:18:30] you I formed you
[1:18:32] to reveal my mystery to make you part of
[1:18:35] my great drama
[1:18:37] I gave you purpose I gave you life I
[1:18:40] gave you breath
[1:18:43] Hallelujah brother Graham said it he
[1:18:47] said your name was put on the Lamb's
[1:18:49] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:18:50] the world and think of this now he said
[1:18:53] the color hair that you have
[1:18:55] it comes down pretty real right the
[1:18:58] color hair you have
[1:18:59] some of you would change your hair color
[1:19:01] if you could
[1:19:02] some of you would change the color of
[1:19:04] your eyes but brother bran said the
[1:19:05] color of eyes that you have
[1:19:07] amen the stature that you're in some of
[1:19:09] you would add an inch some of you would
[1:19:10] give one up amen but the stature that
[1:19:13] you're in God's seen you before the
[1:19:15] foundation of the world
[1:19:17] and now you know it was so wonderful
[1:19:19] hearing brother Ron preached last night
[1:19:20] because I grew up I've heard over
[1:19:22] Decades of my life amen I've heard
[1:19:24] brother Ron preach that the God chose
[1:19:26] the color of your hair God chose I've
[1:19:28] heard him preach that quote so many
[1:19:29] times as a young person but you know
[1:19:30] what it took me a little while to
[1:19:32] believe it amen but what I want to tell
[1:19:34] you young people is that you got a right
[1:19:36] to lay hold of that in the face of every
[1:19:38] complex that you have everything you
[1:19:40] would change about yourself all that
[1:19:42] insecurity all those thoughts of
[1:19:43] insufficiency friends you are allowed to
[1:19:46] lay that aside and take hold of God's
[1:19:48] predestination and say I oh friends you
[1:19:51] realize that a Christian doesn't a
[1:19:53] Christian doesn't love himself love
[1:19:55] herself it's not Christian to love
[1:19:57] yourself but let me tell you something
[1:19:59] to encourage you amen as a Christian
[1:20:01] when you get a revelation of your
[1:20:03] predestination you can love being
[1:20:06] yourself
[1:20:08] you can love being who God made you to
[1:20:10] be friends amen amen I admire I admire
[1:20:14] brother Ron I admire Brother Ray those
[1:20:16] are my heroes amen but you know what I
[1:20:19] like being Nathan Erickson and I like
[1:20:21] doing what I was called to do and I like
[1:20:23] being me I didn't used to think that way
[1:20:26] as a young person but God gave me a
[1:20:27] revelation
[1:20:28] that I've got a part in God's economy
[1:20:31] and nobody 's can feel it
[1:20:34] [Applause]
[1:20:36] else can do what I'm called to do nobody
[1:20:38] can do what you're called to do
[1:20:41] God never thought he never thought up a
[1:20:43] backup plan for you he didn't have a few
[1:20:46] different concepts that he could run
[1:20:48] with if you didn't work out you are a
[1:20:50] perfect
[1:20:51] for ordained creation of God
[1:20:55] you are predestinated unto adoption you
[1:20:59] are possessed what is adoption it's a
[1:21:00] positional placing
[1:21:02] you're predestined to fill a spot in
[1:21:06] this Tabernacle in this Temple of
[1:21:07] restored worship you're one of those
[1:21:09] stones in that wall
[1:21:11] and you might wish you were shaped a
[1:21:12] little different
[1:21:14] you might wish you looked a little
[1:21:15] different you were painted a different
[1:21:16] color but friends if you're in this
[1:21:19] Temple amen then you are housing the
[1:21:23] glory of God
[1:21:25] amen you become the vessel you become
[1:21:27] the container of God's holy presence and
[1:21:31] anybody in this world who wants to get
[1:21:33] to God has got to come through you
[1:21:35] because you are his house you are a
[1:21:38] stone a Lively Stone that has been built
[1:21:40] up and you've been placed and you've
[1:21:42] been shaped in a way that you are shaped
[1:21:44] and nobody's shaped quite like you
[1:21:47] nobody can fill your place friends
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:21:59] and listen to this and he saw you a
[1:22:02] human being
[1:22:03] just like you are
[1:22:06] he saw you a human being like you are
[1:22:08] you mean brother Nathan that God didn't
[1:22:10] just you know pull out the phone book
[1:22:12] and just pick off a list of names at
[1:22:14] random and this one of them just kind of
[1:22:16] happened to look like me and be like me
[1:22:18] God saw you you as a human being you as
[1:22:22] a young man you as a young woman he saw
[1:22:25] you like you are and he said I choose
[1:22:28] that one put that name on my book
[1:22:32] that's the one I want
[1:22:34] you didn't win God's election by some
[1:22:36] Lottery of chance he didn't just spin
[1:22:38] the wheel and you got lucky God chose
[1:22:40] you he foreknew you he saw you he saw
[1:22:43] what you would look like he saw what you
[1:22:45] would be he saw what you would go
[1:22:47] through
[1:22:50] me
[1:22:51] you
[1:22:53] you not anybody else in this room that
[1:22:56] I'm preaching to you but you amen
[1:23:00] uh put that name on my book like we
[1:23:03] preached on Thursday Christ the Holy
[1:23:04] Spirit he wants to come into you with
[1:23:06] your temperament
[1:23:08] amen you know it's it's kind of easy to
[1:23:10] see that God would want to come and take
[1:23:11] over a person and like brother Bram said
[1:23:13] you know you know he wants to think the
[1:23:15] thoughts he would think through that
[1:23:16] person he wants to speak the kind of
[1:23:18] words he would speak to that person he
[1:23:19] wants to do the kind of things he would
[1:23:21] do through that person that's that's you
[1:23:23] know I mean that's that's that's amazing
[1:23:25] but that's a little bit easier to wrap
[1:23:26] our head around amen Until you realize
[1:23:28] what brother Brown's describing is God
[1:23:30] wants to do it through your temperaments
[1:23:33] you say oh brother Nathan of course God
[1:23:34] can come down on Sunday morning and just
[1:23:37] take hold of my pastor and anoint his
[1:23:39] tongue and make him speak the words of
[1:23:41] life to me amen as the very Oracle of
[1:23:44] God but I'm telling you brother sister
[1:23:45] Amen to God with your personality with
[1:23:48] your preferences with your attitude with
[1:23:51] your with with he made you the way that
[1:23:53] you are amen because he wants to express
[1:23:55] himself through that
[1:23:58] Hallelujah brother Samuel Browning
[1:24:00] preach a youth banquet for us one time
[1:24:01] he said something I wish somebody would
[1:24:03] have told me this when I was a young
[1:24:05] person he said listen God wants to give

[1:25:11] higher there's a higher a walk for me
[1:25:13] there's a there's a higher realm amen
[1:25:16] I've come from somewhere I've fallen
[1:25:17] from some Glory
[1:25:18] amen listen to that voice that's God
[1:25:22] calling you and saying hey amen I I've
[1:25:24] got this one I've got that one they're
[1:25:26] in their position they're doing what I
[1:25:28] called them to do but I've got more
[1:25:29] mystery I've got more expression to do
[1:25:32] and I want you to do it
[1:25:34] I want you to be my instrument I want
[1:25:37] you to be my paintbrush I want you to be

[1:25:49] Hallelujah
[1:25:51] he's in you with your temperament and he
[1:25:54] begins to talk about in the unveiling of
[1:25:55] God he talks about you know somebody who
[1:25:57] like a bell maker you know he takes he
[1:25:59] takes he takes the minerals of the earth
[1:26:01] he takes some brass he takes some iron
[1:26:02] he takes some copper and things like
[1:26:03] that and he makes a bell amen but you
[1:26:06] know not every Bell gets the same
[1:26:07] ingredients or rather it's the same
[1:26:09] ingredients but it's a different blend
[1:26:11] it's a different mixture he puts a
[1:26:12] little more iron in this one and he puts
[1:26:14] a little more copper in that one amen
[1:26:16] why because he wants to make it a
[1:26:18] different sound amen because the great
[1:26:20] composer knows how to make beautiful
[1:26:21] music amen so he calls you and he forms
[1:26:24] you and he doesn't make you the same as
[1:26:27] everybody else why because you've got a
[1:26:29] part in this song you got a pardon the
[1:26:31] art you got a part in this expression
[1:26:34] now you might be the lead violin
[1:26:37] amen or or you might be the guy who sits
[1:26:40] there for two hours and right at the end
[1:26:42] of the symphony he pulls out the
[1:26:43] triangle
[1:26:44] yeah
[1:26:46] but brother sister if that's who you are
[1:26:48] you're the only one that can play that
[1:26:50] thing you're the only one who can make
[1:26:52] that sound and it wouldn't be a
[1:26:53] beautiful Symphony without you
[1:26:56] amen so you got to think a little
[1:26:57] different you got to think a little bit
[1:26:59] different than we do with our natural
[1:27:00] Minds is this okay are you enjoying this
[1:27:03] amen he said that's the way God did he
[1:27:06] bred this one to that one and this one
[1:27:07] and that one amen until he got exactly
[1:27:11] what he wanted
[1:27:12] exactly what he wanted now you and me we
[1:27:16] get up in the morning and look in the
[1:27:18] mirror and we don't see what we want
[1:27:20] but I want you to know that God looks
[1:27:22] through the filter of this word he looks
[1:27:24] through the blood of Jesus Christ and he
[1:27:25] sees exactly what he wanted
[1:27:29] he sees exactly what we wanted God will
[1:27:31] get what he wants amen I can see God you
[1:27:34] know before the foundation of the world
[1:27:35] he says Hey Gabriel come over here come

[1:28:24] press himself into being taking somebody
[1:28:26] else's position he's going to be who I
[1:28:28] called him to be so he's going to be the
[1:28:31] all Gabriel he's going to be amazing

[1:30:08] spoken word of God you're seeing things
[1:30:11] that God thought about before there was
[1:30:13] a moon before there were stars in the
[1:30:16] sky amen and God hung every Star in a
[1:30:21] certain Galaxy to tell your story
[1:30:24] amen the first Bible he wrote In The
[1:30:26] Stars the second Bible he wrote with ink
[1:30:29] and Pen but the third Bible the final
[1:30:31] voice the final age the final people
[1:30:34] will be a living breathing epistle
[1:30:38] written and read of all men and they
[1:30:41] think you think you think oh you think
[1:30:43] uh you think that because I'm a preacher
[1:30:45] maybe I should have the attitude like

[1:30:48] hear me today and have the honor of
[1:30:50] hearing my sermon friends amen not under
[1:30:52] the revelation of this message when I

[1:31:03] Amen and the Very thoughts of God spoken
[1:31:06] and expressed in this age Amen to have
[1:31:08] even a glimpse in my heart of what God
[1:31:10] thinks about you is worth everything to
[1:31:13] me it is my honor to stand here and talk
[1:31:15] to you and look at you and see what God
[1:31:19] has wrought what God has created what
[1:31:21] God has spoken into this world
[1:31:23] friends here is thought
[1:31:25] you are Eternal you are special
[1:31:28] you are powerful say oh brother Nathan I
[1:31:31] you know uh uh Power you know that's
[1:31:33] there's preachers and they lay hands on
[1:31:35] the sick and they do Miracles and
[1:31:36] exploits and brother Brown did a lot of
[1:31:38] Supernatural things but I'm I'm just me
[1:31:40] I I don't have power
[1:31:42] brother Brown said that the least little
[1:31:45] touch of God he said God doesn't have
[1:31:47] big heavy spots that's powerful and and
[1:31:49] little weaker spots that are less amen
[1:31:52] he said the least touch the least touch
[1:31:54] you say brother Nathan I got a lot less
[1:31:56] of the of Christ in me than than this
[1:31:59] one or that one or the one that I'm
[1:32:01] looking to or the one that preaches to
[1:32:02] me and I got I'm the least one brother
[1:32:05] Nathan I'm the least one I'm if I'm part
[1:32:07] of this body I'm the skin on the bottom
[1:32:09] of the little toe
[1:32:11] amen then if you are amen then you're
[1:32:14] right down there where the action is
[1:32:15] because you're the closest one to the
[1:32:17] neck of the enemy and all of hell is
[1:32:19] under your feet even if you're the least
[1:32:20] one in his kingdom God Amen the least
[1:32:23] touch of God brother Bram said is
[1:32:25] omnipotent
[1:32:27] not half powerful not sometimes powerful
[1:32:30] oh powerful
[1:32:33] omnipotence lays in you deity lays in
[1:32:36] you
[1:32:37] amen the reason you don't see it is
[1:32:40] because you you haven't learned to think
[1:32:42] in terms of God's economy he said the
[1:32:44] power you got in you now could make a
[1:32:46] new world
[1:32:48] amen and you say oh brother Nathan then
[1:32:50] how can I how come I can't do it how
[1:32:51] come because you don't need a new world
[1:32:53] to live on you're called to overcome
[1:32:54] this one
[1:32:56] you're called to put this world under
[1:32:57] your feet
[1:32:58] amen we got to get moving he said he's
[1:33:01] seen something in me
[1:33:03] and he's seen something in you amen amen
[1:33:06] he had a reason to save you he said look
[1:33:08] at the people that are unsafe today
[1:33:12] look at the millions he could have took
[1:33:14] besides you
[1:33:16] but he took you
[1:33:19] no one can take your place
[1:33:23] amen you're in God's economy
[1:33:26] no one can do it he said that's his love
[1:33:29] for you
[1:33:31] for you
[1:33:33] so what you got to do young people and
[1:33:34] I'd love for you to agree to do this
[1:33:36] from this time forward is you got to
[1:33:38] retrain the mind that you were born with
[1:33:40] to not think in terms of human economy
[1:33:42] but start to think in terms of God's
[1:33:44] economy could we take a few moments and
[1:33:46] deal with that amen you know that we
[1:33:48] live in a society that is obsessed with
[1:33:52] value obsessed with value this
[1:33:54] capitalistic world that we live in amen
[1:33:56] capitalism is not just you know it's not
[1:33:58] just something uh like some system that
[1:34:00] we sort of impose on our on our Humanity
[1:34:02] it's built into who we are that's why it
[1:34:04] works well for fallen human beings amen
[1:34:06] because it it it it exposes our greed it
[1:34:09] exposes our want our lusts and and our
[1:34:11] jealousies and all of those things that
[1:34:13] are in us as human beings and those
[1:34:15] things are in us because we're built
[1:34:17] we're falling amen we're in our first
[1:34:19] birth we are obsessed with value
[1:34:23] we think in terms of value and a certain
[1:34:25] kind of value relative value
[1:34:28] and you know that young people you know
[1:34:30] that everything every time that you
[1:34:31] think about your self-worth every time
[1:34:33] that you measure yourself you're doing
[1:34:34] it against somebody else
[1:34:36] amen if I was as pretty as she is if I
[1:34:38] could sing like he can if I could if I
[1:34:41] was as handsome as that one if I was as
[1:34:42] popular as that one amen and and and and
[1:34:45] you know as young okay you know the
[1:34:47] oppression you know the the the the the
[1:34:49] just the heavy weight amen of having
[1:34:52] that relative value forced down on you
[1:34:55] and know that you no matter what you do
[1:34:57] no matter what you achieve no matter how
[1:34:59] hard you try you'll never measure up
[1:35:03] the devil will never let you do it this
[1:35:05] flesh this mind this human Spirit it it
[1:35:08] doesn't allow us to ever be content it
[1:35:12] doesn't allow us to ever feel worthy it
[1:35:15] doesn't allow us to ever feel like we're
[1:35:16] good enough because of relative value
[1:35:18] because you're looking at me and saying
[1:35:20] well maybe well I don't know maybe I'm
[1:35:22] worth something but I'm not as worth as
[1:35:24] much as him and I'm not worth as much as
[1:35:26] her
[1:35:27] relative value
[1:35:29] hey man it's actually baked into our
[1:35:31] human nature you know if you go to
[1:35:33] school and you take an economics course
[1:35:34] economics 101 you know they begin to
[1:35:36] teach you about a barter economy anybody
[1:35:38] familiar with that you know because and
[1:35:40] they'll explain it like this they'll say
[1:35:41] well now we have money and we have value
[1:35:43] you know we got Canadian dollars in US
[1:35:45] dollars and they have a certain value
[1:35:47] amen but they said way back in the day
[1:35:49] way back sometime somewhere you know
[1:35:51] they didn't have money yet they hadn't
[1:35:53] invented it and so so they would barter
[1:35:55] you know somebody well I got a cow but I
[1:35:57] need three chickens so I'll trade my cow
[1:35:59] for your chickens and that's a barter
[1:36:00] economy you know and we'll just kind of
[1:36:02] agree on what's equal in value and and
[1:36:04] that's how it'll work and then
[1:36:05] eventually they invented money because
[1:36:06] that made it easier did you know that
[1:36:09] this is just for whatever it's worth for
[1:36:11] your interest do you know that in all
[1:36:13] anthropology and all of history and all
[1:36:15] that everything that we know from study
[1:36:17] in humanity nobody could point to a
[1:36:19] society that ever existed without money
[1:36:24] nobody knows that it ever this barter
[1:36:26] economy that's how they teach it but
[1:36:27] nobody knows of any time it ever
[1:36:28] happened
[1:36:29] you know what that tells to me that
[1:36:31] tells me value is not something we
[1:36:33] invented
[1:36:34] it's not just something we came up with
[1:36:36] one day and it goes way back with the
[1:36:38] human race it goes all the way back to
[1:36:41] Eden amen when Adam had something
[1:36:44] valuable very very valuable
[1:36:47] eternally valuable but it was lost and
[1:36:50] deep down on the inside of every human
[1:36:51] being whether they realize it or not
[1:36:52] they know that they're Fallen we know
[1:36:55] that we're unworthy we know we need
[1:36:57] redeems somebody's got to buy us back
[1:36:59] because we're not enough
[1:37:01] we're not worthy we never will be
[1:37:03] because we lack value amen amen you need
[1:37:08] Redemption you know that you're lacking
[1:37:10] value you know that you're never enough
[1:37:12] you'll never feel like you're enough
[1:37:14] you'll never feel worthy you'll never
[1:37:16] feel loved you'll never really be able
[1:37:18] to just let go and be comfortable in
[1:37:20] your own skin why because of this value
[1:37:23] that's imposed on you by your first
[1:37:26] birth
[1:37:27] in the economy of this world you will
[1:37:29] always be compared
[1:37:31] you will be always come be compared in
[1:37:33] human eyes you can't escape it you will
[1:37:35] be compared you will come up lacking
[1:37:38] but in God's economy and God's economy
[1:37:42] God does not look at relative value
[1:37:46] God looks at Eternal value
[1:37:50] and something is only valuable to God if
[1:37:53] it was in his mind at the beginning if
[1:37:54] it's part of his eternal life then it
[1:37:56] has value and it doesn't have high value
[1:37:59] or low value or medium value it is value
[1:38:02] amen because it's Eternal and you are
[1:38:05] the Eternal seed of God and I don't care
[1:38:08] how much the devil wants to compare you
[1:38:10] to somebody else I don't care how much
[1:38:12] your peers will compare you or how much
[1:38:14] you'll be asked to measure up to
[1:38:15] somebody else God doesn't measure You by
[1:38:18] anybody else he only measures you by the
[1:38:20] blood of his own son
[1:38:22] and that's your value
[1:38:25] Amen in this economy that we have we
[1:38:27] have things like inflation you know
[1:38:29] where you got to go down to the
[1:38:30] supermarket you got to pay twelve
[1:38:31] dollars for a for for a dozen eggs eggs
[1:38:33] aren't worth ten dollars it's just
[1:38:35] something that happened in the economy
[1:38:37] it was a fluke it was it was some some
[1:38:39] flawed mechanic something got messed up
[1:38:41] somewhere and now you got to pay a price
[1:38:43] for those eggs and the and the eggs
[1:38:45] aren't worth that but you have to pay
[1:38:46] the price but in God's that value Amen
[1:38:49] in God's economy there's no inflation
[1:38:52] there's no Market manipulation he
[1:38:55] doesn't mess with the interest rates in
[1:38:57] God's economy the price is the value
[1:39:01] I said the price is a value and if God
[1:39:04] would pay the blood of his only son if
[1:39:07] God would shed his life then your value
[1:39:10] is the value of the blood you're the
[1:39:13] value of his own life
[1:39:15] that's your value
[1:39:17] is the price that he was willing to pay
[1:39:19] God didn't get a poor bargain amen God
[1:39:22] God didn't get to you know God didn't
[1:39:24] get ripped off God knew what he was
[1:39:27] paying and he was willing to pay it
[1:39:30] for you
[1:39:32] and the beautiful thing about it is if
[1:39:33] you were the only one that was ever
[1:39:35] saved if you were the only one that was
[1:39:36] ever redeemed if God never redeemed
[1:39:38] William Branham and and Martin Luther
[1:39:40] and John Wesley and Nathan Erickson and
[1:39:43] Andrew Dodd if God if God hadn't
[1:39:44] redeemed the rest of them and it was
[1:39:46] just you if it was just you he would
[1:39:48] have sent his son he would have shed his
[1:39:51] blood and he would have paid the price
[1:39:52] just for you because that's how God's
[1:39:55] economy Works amen because Eternal is
[1:39:58] infinite it can't be measured it can't
[1:40:00] be compared
[1:40:02] it can't be it can't be it can't be
[1:40:05] comprehended
[1:40:07] that's how much you mean to God
[1:40:10] that's how much you mean to God but your
[1:40:12] mind won't let you think that so you
[1:40:13] need the mind of Christ to realize it's
[1:40:16] not robbery to think that way you're
[1:40:18] allowed to trespass there you're allowed
[1:40:21] to dare to believe that God loves you
[1:40:24] and he values you and he chose you and
[1:40:27] he wanted you amen you're allowed to
[1:40:29] believe that God wants you to have the
[1:40:32] Holy Ghost you're allowed to believe
[1:40:33] that God wants to cover your sins he he
[1:40:36] wants to deliver you from what you're
[1:40:37] going through he wants to heal your body
[1:40:39] he wants to do it
[1:40:42] because of this eternal value that's in
[1:40:44] you you see friends I I just hope you
[1:40:47] can hear the Cry of my heart and my
[1:40:49] passion as a as a as a as a youth
[1:40:51] Minister as somebody who loves the young
[1:40:53] people amen I I love you you are
[1:40:55] valuable to me you are important to me
[1:40:57] amen but you you're but but but what I
[1:41:00] am preaching to you is not some kind of
[1:41:02] a watered down wishy-washy VeggieTales
[1:41:04] religion about how you're very special
[1:41:07] and God loves you very much and it's
[1:41:09] because why because it's not that I
[1:41:12] assign you value it's not that I care
[1:41:15] about you and and I love you in my human
[1:41:17] love and so I treat you as if you have
[1:41:19] value
[1:41:20] you are value
[1:41:23] you're part of these Eternal mystery you
[1:41:27] are value
[1:41:29] and if I stopped loving you and your
[1:41:31] parents stopped loving you and your
[1:41:33] pastor stopped loving you and the world
[1:41:35] rejects you God loves you
[1:41:39] and you're as valuable you're his butt
[1:41:41] red ruby you are his bride you're the
[1:41:44] pure virtuous sinless spotless Bride of
[1:41:47] the son of God
[1:41:50] you're him
[1:41:52] you're called by his name you'll sit in
[1:41:55] a throne with him you'll judge over
[1:41:56] Angels you'll judge over multitudes in
[1:41:58] the valley of decision that's who you
[1:42:00] are
[1:42:01] whether you know it or not whether
[1:42:03] you're ready to accept it or not but the
[1:42:05] sooner you accept it the sooner you'll
[1:42:07] lay down all your false humility and all
[1:42:09] of that human Pride that wants to argue
[1:42:11] with God about how we're not good enough
[1:42:13] and how someday we'll someday we'll
[1:42:15] measure up someday we'll achieve value
[1:42:17] someday we'll be worthy of being
[1:42:19] compared amen friends amen that's a
[1:42:22] that's a that's a that's a game amen
[1:42:24] that's a that's a path that leads to
[1:42:26] destruction amen but the way to get onto
[1:42:28] God's narrow way the way to get on the
[1:42:31] highway to Holiness amen the path that
[1:42:33] leads you to a Rapture the path that
[1:42:35] leads you to heaven amen is when you
[1:42:37] make up your mind and say God I don't
[1:42:39] understand it I'm barely willing to
[1:42:41] accept it I can't wrap my mind around it
[1:42:43] but I accept your grace I accept your
[1:42:46] pardon I accept your evaluation I will
[1:42:49] believe you Lord I am value
[1:42:52] I am important
[1:42:54] maybe not to another human being in this
[1:42:56] world but Lord I'm important to you
[1:42:59] I'm part of your mystery I'm part of
[1:43:01] your economy
[1:43:03] did you think God shed his blood for you
[1:43:05] because of obligation
[1:43:08] God shed his blood for you because of
[1:43:10] Desire
[1:43:12] because he desired you
[1:43:15] thought you were Worthy
[1:43:17] he thought you were acceptable he
[1:43:19] thought you were redeemable
[1:43:21] Hallelujah
[1:43:23] Hallelujah you got to think in terms of
[1:43:25] God's economy you're not you the world
[1:43:27] that we live in is not geared to produce
[1:43:29] that kind of thinking you're
[1:43:31] biologically not per not you're not
[1:43:33] you're not built to produce that kind of
[1:43:35] thinking the only way to be able to
[1:43:36] think that way is begin to feed on the
[1:43:38] word of God and hear what he thinks
[1:43:40] about you let him reveal it to you let
[1:43:42] him come down into your bedroom or into
[1:43:44] your car into your closet or or or or or
[1:43:46] or or wherever he finds you in that
[1:43:48] quiet moment and let him be he comes he
[1:43:50] comes he he passes by everybody on your
[1:43:52] street amen he passed by a lot of
[1:43:54] churches this afternoon to come and
[1:43:56] fellowship with us if you feel his
[1:43:58] presence today he came to you amen amen
[1:44:01] and and he wanted to and so he begins to
[1:44:05] whisper his love secrets to you he
[1:44:07] begins to just tell you hey you realize
[1:44:09] I love you
[1:44:11] you realize I'm important you realize
[1:44:12] when I said there would be an invincible
[1:44:14] Army you realize when I said there be a
[1:44:16] selected bride that you're that
[1:44:18] you're that and you're saying oh Lord no
[1:44:20] way no way no way kind of rude don't you
[1:44:24] think
[1:44:25] laughs
[1:44:27] when God's pouring out his heart to you
[1:44:29] and making himself vulnerable humbling
[1:44:31] himself to reach this out to you
[1:44:34] and we because of our ideas of value
[1:44:36] because of our concepts of relativity
[1:44:40] because of the way because we always
[1:44:41] want to compare ourselves because we
[1:44:43] give our complexes the preeminence
[1:44:45] we want to say no God choose somebody
[1:44:47] else
[1:44:49] you got you already got great people you
[1:44:50] got great leaders you got great men
[1:44:53] you don't need me
[1:44:55] brother Branham said sometimes great
[1:44:57] guys get together and you hear them say
[1:44:59] oh great so-and-so and great so and so
[1:45:02] our great brother our great leader he
[1:45:04] said don't ever do that he said there
[1:45:06] are no great ones Among Us there's only
[1:45:08] one great one and that's God Amen he
[1:45:11] said and you are we are brothers we are
[1:45:13] sisters he said I don't care if you're
[1:45:15] pastoring a church it's got five people
[1:45:17] in it amen that doesn't make you little
[1:45:19] that makes you a brother
[1:45:22] you might be the only young person in
[1:45:24] your youth group that don't make you
[1:45:25] little it makes you a brother it makes
[1:45:26] you a sister it makes you part of this
[1:45:28] thing and in fact you're overcoming
[1:45:30] things you're overcoming in Realms of
[1:45:32] loneliness amen that the ones with the
[1:45:34] big church they don't understand they
[1:45:36] can't even wrap their minds around it
[1:45:37] but you know what you're living you're
[1:45:39] striving you're surviving amen why
[1:45:41] because you're part of this thing and
[1:45:43] nobody could take you out of it
[1:45:45] glory to God you're a brother you are a
[1:45:48] sister he said he said God doesn't have
[1:45:50] little children and big children he just
[1:45:52] has children he said they're all the
[1:45:55] same
[1:45:56] he said go notice God himself came down
[1:46:00] from the ivory palaces of Glory to
[1:46:02] become one of us now who's the big one
[1:46:04] he didn't come down here to take the
[1:46:06] form of a priest but a servant he didn't
[1:46:09] come and Lord over us he pitched his
[1:46:11] tent with us he stood at the grave of
[1:46:12] Lazarus and cried hot tears just to know
[1:46:14] what you're going through
[1:46:16] the sympathizing Jesus
[1:46:18] and what did he do as a servant he
[1:46:20] washed the very clay that he created
[1:46:23] he washed the feet of his Apostles and
[1:46:25] others now who's great you know we think
[1:46:28] in our terms of value we see big ones in
[1:46:30] the kingdom of God we see little ones we
[1:46:33] see those through our human
[1:46:33] understanding but you've got to realize
[1:46:35] there's only one rank in the kingdom of
[1:46:37] God that's foot wash funky
[1:46:41] if Jesus Christ would leave the Splendor
[1:46:43] of Heaven and the king of all glory the
[1:46:44] creator of the universe would would
[1:46:45] kneel down on the floor and wash the
[1:46:48] dirty feet of some some foul-mouthed
[1:46:50] fisherman
[1:46:51] amen then what then how are you and I
[1:46:54] going to think anything of ourselves
[1:46:55] friends amen but praise be to God it was
[1:46:57] God that thought something of us amen it
[1:47:00] was his choosing the thought we were
[1:47:01] valuable it's not who we are it's not
[1:47:03] big ones and little ones and and and
[1:47:05] it's not measuring ourselves against
[1:47:07] people that we think are greater than us
[1:47:09] it's just to realize I'm part of this
[1:47:11] I'm a brother I am a sister I'm in this
[1:47:14] family I'm in this bloodline I'm in this
[1:47:17] lineage
[1:47:18] what a glorious thing amen now you know
[1:47:21] you know of course brother Branham you
[1:47:23] know because many people would preach
[1:47:24] what I'm preaching you right now but it
[1:47:25] comes from a place of jealousy amen it
[1:47:28] comes from a place of trying to tear
[1:47:29] down somebody that God's lifted up a
[1:47:31] Ministry that God has raised up Amen
[1:47:33] brother Brandon would use he would talk
[1:47:34] about you know fellow fellow Pentecostal
[1:47:36] leaders and things and he would say this
[1:47:38] one you know one of the great ones Among
[1:47:39] Us or our great brother so and so and he
[1:47:41] would use terminology like this amen
[1:47:43] because that's how the body of Christ
[1:47:45] works you're going to have men that are
[1:47:47] going to shake the world and you know
[1:47:48] and preach big conventions and and
[1:47:50] they're going to be you know and they're
[1:47:52] going to be in the spotlight maybe more
[1:47:54] than another one and you're going to
[1:47:55] have that amen because ye we're not
[1:47:57] supposed to all be the same we're all
[1:47:59] different
[1:48:00] but we're valued the same and God
[1:48:03] doesn't look at the big name preacher
[1:48:05] amen and think any more highly of that
[1:48:07] human flesh than he does of you
[1:48:11] amen the only way you could possibly
[1:48:13] believe that is to let go of your ideas
[1:48:15] of value
[1:48:16] amen and believe in God's economy
[1:48:19] hallelujah amen as I've preached before
[1:48:23] you know we might look at a man like
[1:48:24] brother Ron Spencer that's traveled the
[1:48:26] world and he has a Ministry that we all
[1:48:28] love and and he's dear to us he's
[1:48:30] important to us and you know many people
[1:48:32] look and they look through eyes of
[1:48:34] jealousy at that but you know what you
[1:48:36] know what it tells me you know as a
[1:48:38] young Minister you know uh the just the
[1:48:40] cry my heart think you know what it just
[1:48:42] hit me one day God loved me so much
[1:48:46] amen if if you took away my Ministry if
[1:48:48] I never preached another meaning amen if
[1:48:50] I had no position in the church if I was
[1:48:52] nothing in this body not if I couldn't
[1:48:54] hold the door for somebody if I couldn't
[1:48:56] even sweep the floor yet God thought so
[1:48:59] much of me he would raise up Ron Spencer
[1:49:01] he raised up Ray Erickson he raised up
[1:49:03] Ed hammermeister amen he raised up your
[1:49:05] church he raised up my church why
[1:49:07] because he valued me amen because I was
[1:49:09] part of his eternity and he had to use
[1:49:11] those instruments he had to use what we
[1:49:13] think are great gifts he had to use what
[1:49:15] we think are small gifts and they all
[1:49:17] had to work together Amen to bring me
[1:49:19] into the unity of the faith why because
[1:49:22] this thing isn't complete without me and
[1:49:24] it's not complete without you you have
[1:49:28] value
[1:49:30] hallelujah
[1:49:32] hallelujah brother oh my see in God's
[1:49:35] economy we're all completely different
[1:49:37] we'll all have different lives different
[1:49:38] experiences different Ministries but
[1:49:40] we're all valued the same
[1:49:43] and there's not another message on the
[1:49:45] face of the Earth that can reveal that
[1:49:46] to you like this one
[1:49:49] brother bran preached adoption anybody
[1:49:51] ever listened to the adoption series
[1:49:53] study that remember he said it was a
[1:49:55] positional placing and so you are called
[1:49:58] You're predestinated to an adoption
[1:49:59] which means you've got a position in
[1:50:01] this thing you've got a place that's
[1:50:03] reserved for you and nobody else can
[1:50:05] fill it and only a prophet could preach
[1:50:07] it now God could have come to a lot down
[1:50:09] to a lot of men in the in the in the 50s
[1:50:11] and 60s big charismatic leaders and
[1:50:13] Pentecostal you know revivalists and and
[1:50:16] overseers and Bishops and there was a
[1:50:18] lot of men that God could have come down
[1:50:19] to and said hey I pick you you're gonna
[1:50:22] you're gonna you're gonna preach you're
[1:50:24] gonna preach this people into an
[1:50:26] adoption age you're going to Usher forth
[1:50:28] the adoption you're going to bring it to
[1:50:30] the church you're going to teach it
[1:50:31] you're going to break it down and you
[1:50:32] know what it would have been
[1:50:34] it would have been some guy on TV in the
[1:50:37] biggest city in the world with a million
[1:50:39] people around him on the center stage
[1:50:41] he'd be emptying out hospitals he'd be
[1:50:44] walking on water he'd be doing the
[1:50:45] Supernatural and look at the adoption
[1:50:47] has come to the church look how powerful
[1:50:49] I am look how big my Ministry is look at
[1:50:51] my worldwide Outreach there would have
[1:50:53] been no room for you there would have
[1:50:55] been no room for me
[1:50:57] but brother random comes and he preaches
[1:50:59] adoption he said if God's called you to
[1:51:01] be a farmer you'll be the best farmer
[1:51:04] there ever was if God called you to be a
[1:51:06] mechanic if God called you to be a
[1:51:07] factory worker if God called you to be a
[1:51:09] housewife or anything that the world
[1:51:11] might not value amen but if God calls
[1:51:14] you to it then it's of Eternal value
[1:51:18] we don't all have to be prophets we
[1:51:20] don't have to all be five-fold Ministry
[1:51:21] amen but we got a part in the body
[1:51:24] and the Bible said the ones that we
[1:51:27] think are less honorable on those are
[1:51:29] bestowed more abundant on her and the
[1:51:31] ones that you think you can do without
[1:51:32] you can't
[1:51:34] you can't you can't have a church
[1:51:36] without young people you can't have a
[1:51:39] successful meeting without a without a
[1:51:40] youth group on fire for the Lord you are
[1:51:43] the thermometer of the church the best
[1:51:45] meetings we've ever had in our home
[1:51:46] church are always right or always the
[1:51:49] first one after a youth camp a youth
[1:51:50] meeting or something like that amen I
[1:51:52] was I was explaining this to our young
[1:51:54] people you realize why that is you did
[1:51:56] that
[1:51:57] that amen because you got you got to a
[1:52:00] meeting amen where you were valued amen
[1:52:03] where somebody had a burden for the
[1:52:04] Youth so they didn't have just a whole
[1:52:05] weekend of meetings and leave you out
[1:52:07] they set a place amen where you could be
[1:52:09] valued and you could be ministered too
[1:52:11] and so what did it do it gave you a seat
[1:52:13] at the table and you began to
[1:52:14] participate amen you get on fire for God
[1:52:17] then when you show up to church we
[1:52:18] really have church because you affect
[1:52:20] the service more than you think you do
[1:52:22] if you come tonight amen to this prayer
[1:52:24] line service and you come with an
[1:52:26] expectation in your heart you come just
[1:52:28] burning with faith and you come saying
[1:52:30] Lord I'm going to participate in this
[1:52:32] thing it might be the greatest meeting
[1:52:34] you've ever been in
[1:52:37] because you matter
[1:52:39] because you're essential
[1:52:41] to the kingdom of God hallelujah we
[1:52:43] gotta we got to wrap our minds around
[1:52:45] that Amen brother Ben talk about little
[1:52:47] David there was nothing about him he was
[1:52:48] a little Stripling boy you wouldn't have
[1:52:50] picked him I wouldn't have picked him
[1:52:51] but God chose him
[1:52:53] amen so it's not what we look at and
[1:52:55] brother Brahm said well you say well
[1:52:57] brother Branham I wasn't called to be a
[1:52:59] preacher he said you might be called to
[1:53:01] be a housewife but you got your position
[1:53:04] in Christ Jesus by the Holy Ghost you're
[1:53:06] just as much David as the rest of them
[1:53:09] young lady amen how many times have you
[1:53:12] been made to feel like you're of less
[1:53:14] value like you're an afterthought like
[1:53:17] you're a second class person just
[1:53:18] because you're a woman amen but in God's
[1:53:21] economy amen you are his elected
[1:53:24] anointed you are called to be that
[1:53:26] housewife you are called to be that
[1:53:27] mother and you are dripping with the oil
[1:53:30] of anointing you are you are an
[1:53:32] essential part of the economy of God and
[1:53:34] God raised you up in this day and he
[1:53:37] didn't he didn't ask anybody else to
[1:53:38] fill your place he knew you were the one
[1:53:41] that could do it and he didn't make you
[1:53:44] a halfway housewife he didn't make you a
[1:53:46] halfway mother he didn't make you a
[1:53:47] halfway young lady a halfway singer a
[1:53:49] halfway worshiper a halfway puller no he
[1:53:52] went all the way with you he went all
[1:53:54] the way to Calvary to produce you God
[1:53:57] values you amen I know that people don't
[1:53:59] treat you right I know that there are
[1:54:01] complexes that come amen with being a
[1:54:03] Holiness sister and being under the the
[1:54:05] derision of this world and people making
[1:54:07] fun and persecuting you amen but if just
[1:54:11] for a moment amen you could just enter
[1:54:13] in and have the confidence to rest your
[1:54:16] soul on how much God thinks of you to
[1:54:19] make you the banner of this message Amen
[1:54:21] to to fly you in the face of this world
[1:54:24] and say this is my bride
[1:54:27] this is my beauty of Holiness this is my
[1:54:31] fifth gospel this is my living word
[1:54:34] you see in the body of Christ every
[1:54:37] joint supplies
[1:54:39] remember participation is not an option
[1:54:42] you cannot be in the body of Christ and
[1:54:45] just be a consumer you can't just sit
[1:54:47] there service after service and cross

[1:55:30] to be or what my role is or what anybody
[1:55:33] thinks about me but let me be a part of
[1:55:35] this eternal story
[1:55:37] let me be part of this
[1:55:39] nobody in the bodies without purpose
[1:55:41] what is the mystery behind the message
[1:55:43] Christ in you
[1:55:46] Christ in you so the mystery is what's
[1:55:49] being revealed
[1:55:51] not to you
[1:55:53] but through you
[1:55:54] what is being revealed through you
[1:55:56] that's a question to ask yourself
[1:55:58] what does God want to reveal through me
[1:56:02] amen not to your life but through your
[1:56:05] life Jesus preached about the the 11th
[1:56:07] Hour workers and there was a group of
[1:56:09] people that came right at the end you
[1:56:11] know and and they came and there were
[1:56:13] people been working all day in the field
[1:56:15] and then at the 11th Hour some workers
[1:56:17] came and they just they just had a short
[1:56:19] quick work uh and they put their labor
[1:56:22] in and then the master the of the
[1:56:24] Harvest comes and he hands out all
[1:56:26] everybody's wages and he paid the ones
[1:56:28] at the 11th Hour the same that he paid
[1:56:30] the first ones
[1:56:32] and they began to look at that and they
[1:56:34] say that's not fair
[1:56:36] that's not just
[1:56:38] you just got here
[1:56:41] and now you think that you you you
[1:56:43] deserve the same reward that it that
[1:56:46] that the ones that the ones that came
[1:56:48] before you the ones that were here in
[1:56:49] the first place
[1:56:51] you think you deserve what Peter had
[1:56:55] you're a young person in 2023 the Lord
[1:56:57] might come tomorrow
[1:56:58] and you think you get to have what Paul
[1:57:00] had and Peter had
[1:57:04] you think you got a right to what
[1:57:06] brother Branham had
[1:57:08] when you're a teenager
[1:57:10] and the last little sliver of light
[1:57:13] doesn't sound fair does it
[1:57:15] amen and so so people got upset about it
[1:57:18] but you know what the master said he
[1:57:19] said I've got a right to call who I want
[1:57:21] to call
[1:57:23] and I got a right to pay them what I
[1:57:25] think they're worth
[1:57:27] amen he said and there's many that are
[1:57:29] called there's a lot of people called
[1:57:30] but there's very few that are chosen and
[1:57:33] so if you're chosen then you deserve the
[1:57:35] wage
[1:57:36] you deserve the value because I called
[1:57:39] you and you answered and I chose you
[1:57:42] amen and I want to tell you young people
[1:57:44] everybody that God called everybody that
[1:57:47] God chose there's a wage that's due to
[1:57:50] them amen there is a wage you say well I
[1:57:53] don't deserve it brother Nathan I just
[1:57:54] got here I'm just a young person amen
[1:57:56] that's all beside the point you don't
[1:57:59] deserve it but it's your do and you've
[1:58:02] got it coming it's promised to you
[1:58:05] say brother Nathan there's not enough
[1:58:07] time to make a difference the Lord's
[1:58:09] coming tomorrow brother Brown said if
[1:58:10] the Lord is coming tomorrow but my roof
[1:58:12] needed fixing I would get up on that
[1:58:14] roof with a hammer and when the Lord
[1:58:15] came I'd be up there fixing that roof I
[1:58:18] say God give us a generation of young
[1:58:20] people
[1:58:21] with a cry in their heart say Lord the
[1:58:24] time is short there's not much
[1:58:25] opportunity but I will use the
[1:58:27] opportunity that I have to work for you
[1:58:31] but well I don't have a Ministry brother
[1:58:33] Nathan I don't have a special talent
[1:58:34] maybe all you have is a hammer maybe all
[1:58:36] you have is a broom maybe all you have
[1:58:39] is a kind word but I'll tell you what we
[1:58:41] need it
[1:58:42] we need some young people to care about
[1:58:44] the work
[1:58:45] amen Moses just had a stick Moses knew
[1:58:49] he couldn't do it Moses knew he couldn't
[1:58:50] be who he was called to be but the Lord
[1:58:52] said what's that in your hand Moses he
[1:58:54] said this this whole thing this is just
[1:58:56] an old dry stick God said good enough
[1:58:59] Sanson just had a Jawbone shamgar just

[1:59:14] there's so much work to do
[1:59:17] there's Generations that came before us
[1:59:18] that split churches and hurt feelings
[1:59:20] and preached false Doctrine there's a
[1:59:23] whole lot of work to do there's work for

[1:59:51] Harvest is great but the workers are few
[1:59:54] oh
[1:59:55] one time I read something it stuck with
[1:59:58] me all these years it was one of those
[2:00:00] times a little different from now but it
[2:00:01] was one of those times in the economy
[2:00:03] where where there the unemployment rates
[2:00:06] were really high you know the struggle
[2:00:08] of young people of looking for good work
[2:00:09] and things and it was one of those times
[2:00:11] when there was just nothing to be found
[2:00:12] and everybody was saying there's no work
[2:00:15] there's no work
[2:00:18] and I read something somebody said you
[2:00:19] know they say there's no work
[2:00:21] but there's bridges falling apart
[2:00:24] there's young people going hungry
[2:00:26] there's people that are homeless

[2:00:30] disease there's war
[2:00:32] there's lots of work
[2:00:34] there's just no jobs
[2:00:38] and never confuse work for a job young
[2:00:41] people never think that just because
[2:00:43] you're not a deacon and just because
[2:00:44] you're not a preacher and just because
[2:00:46] you're not a pastor and just because you
[2:00:48] don't have a position in your church and
[2:00:49] just because nobody sees what you're
[2:00:51] doing

[2:00:57] about the work God let me work let me

[2:02:44] day don't ever let anybody take that
[2:02:46] away from you brother Brown said
[2:02:48] actually that the seventh Angels message
[2:02:50] opened the mystery of the seals and when
[2:02:52] it did it called the 11th Hour Gentile
[2:02:55] workers and it called them to receive
[2:02:57] the same pay that the first hour workers
[2:03:01] got amen you say you're it you mean that
[2:03:04] that I amen am do amen what Peter had
[2:03:07] that I could have what Paul had that I
[2:03:11] could have those Pentecostal blessings
[2:03:12] that I could have that Apostolic power
[2:03:14] that I could be as important to the
[2:03:17] economy of God as every Messenger as
[2:03:20] every Prophet as every as every Pastor
[2:03:22] as every priest
[2:03:25] absolutely that's what the seventh
[2:03:28] Angel's message came to tell you that
[2:03:30] it's not too late but the time is now to
[2:03:33] receive a bride wage
[2:03:36] amen you're not supposed to be an
[2:03:38] entry-level Christian a young person is
[2:03:41] not supposed to be a part-time believer
[2:03:43] and you just got in on the ground floor
[2:03:45] no you're an equal part amen of the
[2:03:49] economy of God Amen you are you are the
[2:03:52] expression of his purpose
[2:03:54] you are as essential as I am essential
[2:03:57] as any man or woman of God is essential
[2:04:01] do you believe that hey man you are
[2:04:03] essential and there is a wage that is
[2:04:05] coming to you there's a lot of people
[2:04:07] that appreciate young people and the
[2:04:09] first thing they want to tell you is
[2:04:10] that the baptism of the Holy Ghost was
[2:04:12] just for the Pentecostals and the only
[2:04:14] way and and that experience of God Amen
[2:04:16] where the fire of God would fall from
[2:04:17] Heaven and fill a life well that was for
[2:04:19] some you know well we had that when I
[2:04:21] was a young person but now we've got the
[2:04:22] word and now young people don't get born
[2:04:24] again lives don't get changed anymore
[2:04:26] amen demons don't get cast out anymore
[2:04:29] that was all now we've just got the word
[2:04:31] and we're a mature church that's not
[2:04:33] mature that's old and dried up and weak
[2:04:37] but thank God for a generation of young
[2:04:39] people amen who recognize amen that if
[2:04:42] he did it for my father if he did it for
[2:04:45] my grandfather amen then the same wage
[2:04:47] that same Pentecostal blessing I've got
[2:04:50] a right to partake of the baptism of the
[2:04:53] Holy Ghost I've got a right to know
[2:04:55] Jesus Christ personally I've got a right
[2:04:57] to have the fire of Heaven amen fall
[2:04:59] from the sky and fill every fiber of my
[2:05:02] being and baptize me into the work of
[2:05:06] God
[2:05:07] said in 1965 after the seals in case you
[2:05:12] care about that he said I believe that
[2:05:14] Pentecost began without an ending it is
[2:05:17] to Every Creature it is to all times it
[2:05:21] is to all places
[2:05:22] Pentecost should always remain and the
[2:05:26] Pentecostal blessings
[2:05:28] should be upon the people and what is
[2:05:30] the Pentecostal blessing it's the
[2:05:32] confirmation of the Resurrection now if
[2:05:35] we're going to sit around and belong to
[2:05:36] a church and talk about how Jesus has
[2:05:38] risen from the dead you've got to write
[2:05:40] for something a little deeper than that
[2:05:42] amen because he didn't just call you out
[2:05:44] so you could talk about how he was risen
[2:05:46] from the dead but the Resurrection Life
[2:05:48] the quickening power the Holy Ghost is
[2:05:52] promised to you by a Pentecostal
[2:05:54] blessing that Christ himself can fill
[2:05:57] your life and make you the evidence of
[2:05:59] the Resurrection
[2:06:01] to all times it's all places it never
[2:06:04] stopped it's still going
[2:06:07] don't have the baptism the Holy Ghost
[2:06:09] it's here right now
[2:06:12] it's his desire to give it to you
[2:06:17] if Jesus is risen there should be a
[2:06:19] confirmation in me I want my value I
[2:06:23] want my purpose
[2:06:24] I want my wage brother man said are we
[2:06:27] really getting the people to Christ are
[2:06:28] we just getting them to church and what
[2:06:30] are you young people where have we got
[2:06:32] you with all of our teaching with all of
[2:06:34] our preaching with all of our church
[2:06:35] attendance amen have we got you to
[2:06:38] Christ or you just belong to a message
[2:06:42] but if you want to know Christ amen then
[2:06:45] there's a wage that is promised to you
[2:06:48] you are valuable enough that God wants
[2:06:51] you to have it
[2:06:53] he wants to empty out the heavens amen
[2:06:55] and pour His glory down into this church
[2:06:58] in this city to these young people and
[2:07:01] fill every heart
[2:07:02] with the fire of God Amen to give you
[2:07:05] the power that Peter had that Paul had
[2:07:08] that James and John had those sons of
[2:07:10] thunder that rock the world with the
[2:07:12] message of their day amen God called you
[2:07:14] to be the final voice to this final age
[2:07:17] to fill you with his holy spirit
[2:07:20] and use you Amen to light Revival fires
[2:07:24] on every Hilltop that will receive it
[2:07:27] that's another Post in 63 quote amen God
[2:07:31] didn't ask you to join the Revival he
[2:07:34] called you to be the Revival
[2:07:37] and he promised it would be here he
[2:07:39] promised you would have it he promised
[2:07:41] it to all times in all seasons amen I
[2:07:45] grew up in a message Church
[2:07:47] I was a message brat amen I I had the
[2:07:52] pedigree I have always all of my life I
[2:07:54] have been associated with the message
[2:07:56] I'm a third generation message believer
[2:07:59] but God doesn't have any grandchildren
[2:08:02] God doesn't have any grandchildren and
[2:08:05] all of that never paid off
[2:08:07] I never reefed a wage amen by grandpa
[2:08:10] being a pastor I never reaped a wage
[2:08:12] just by dad being a deacon I never
[2:08:14] reaped a wage by being raised right and
[2:08:16] talking right and dressing right and
[2:08:18] hanging out with the right people and
[2:08:19] belonging to the right church I never
[2:08:21] read the wage amen but one day in a
[2:08:24] house Amen in the state of Michigan
[2:08:26] there was a group of young people
[2:08:28] gathered together it wasn't Church it
[2:08:30] wasn't a youth meeting it wasn't a
[2:08:32] special service it was just a youth
[2:08:34] Gathering amen but at that youth
[2:08:36] Gathering amen we got in one mind and
[2:08:39] one Accord and the power of God came
[2:08:41] from the heavens amen like a heavyweight
[2:08:44] and a baptized a house full of young
[2:08:46] people
[2:08:47] amen not in 1963 not in
[2:08:51] 1977 but in 2011 2012 God sent a Revival
[2:08:56] he said every generation has to receive
[2:08:59] its own Revival your grandfathers and
[2:09:01] grandmothers had their Revival your
[2:09:04] father and your mother had their Revival
[2:09:06] but don't you realize his 11th Hour
[2:09:08] workers that you've got a right Amen to
[2:09:11] the wages of Life Today amen you won't
[2:09:14] reap the wages of sin you're not called
[2:09:16] to death you're called the life in the
[2:09:18] Holy Ghost life in Jesus Christ
[2:09:22] I was there amen when the power filled
[2:09:25] that building just like it was in the
[2:09:26] upper room it was exactly the same as it
[2:09:29] was on the day of Pentecost amen and
[2:09:31] I've gone around and testified about
[2:09:32] that amen I've been criticized for it
[2:09:35] I've been called Pentecostal I've been
[2:09:37] called I've been you know I've been
[2:09:39] called uh uh behind I I've been called a
[2:09:42] fanatic I've been called all those
[2:09:44] things but it's too late for that
[2:09:45] because I've already earned the wage I
[2:09:48] didn't earn it I reaped it amen I was
[2:09:50] granted this wage you can't tell me God
[2:09:52] doesn't feel young people with the Holy
[2:09:54] Ghost I'm just like Mary they could make
[2:09:56] fun of her amen but brother man said she
[2:09:58] knew whose child that was
[2:10:00] she was there when it happened
[2:10:02] she was the one that had happened too
[2:10:04] and you can have that same experience
[2:10:07] today

[2:10:27] time it was chronic it was incurable
[2:10:28] amen and when that Holy Ghost fell in
[2:10:30] that place we didn't have any pastors or
[2:10:32] deacons or Elders of the church to lay
[2:10:34] hands on him but a group of young people
[2:10:36] laid hands Amen on a young boy named
[2:10:38] Christopher amen I asked him years later

[2:14:04] the Revival didn't end in our parents
[2:14:06] generation
[2:14:07] our grandparents generation brother
[2:14:09] branham's generation
[2:14:11] he said that our generation every
[2:14:13] generation has to receive their own
[2:14:16] Revival
[2:14:17] and when he spoke of a bride's Revival
[2:14:19] when he spoke of an invincible Army when
[2:14:21] he spoke of Supernatural when he spoke
[2:14:22] of overcoming power he wasn't just
[2:14:25] speaking of the ones that we look up to
[2:14:27] it wasn't just speaking of Our Heroes of
[2:14:29] the faith our elders our preachers our
[2:14:32] ministers
[2:14:33] you were in that mystery
[2:14:35] [Music]
[2:14:37] do you believe that tonight
[2:14:40] then if you're part of that eternal life
[2:14:42] then you're just as essential you're
[2:14:45] just as valuable
[2:14:46] you've got just as much a right
[2:14:50] as any of the rest
[2:14:52] [Music]
[2:14:55] so I'm going to open up the altar today
[2:14:57] it's not an altar that could save you
[2:14:58] but it's your faith at the altar
[2:15:02] I'd like to just invite you
[2:15:04] [Music]
[2:15:05] and you could tell by the way that I'm
[2:15:07] approaching this I'm not trying to
[2:15:09] manufacture a response
[2:15:10] I don't want I don't want just a
[2:15:13] dry-eyed obedience just to get a group
[2:15:15] of young people at an altar
[2:15:18] but I have invested my energy into this
[2:15:20] service because I believe that there's a
[2:15:23] value
[2:15:24] laying in you as a group of young people
[2:15:27] I believe that there's a great potential
[2:15:30] in each and every one of your lives I
[2:15:32] believe that you matter
[2:15:34] but even if I didn't it wouldn't change
[2:15:36] the fact that you matter
[2:15:38] so I want to invite you if you've never
[2:15:40] had the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:15:42] why not receive it today
[2:15:45] you say well brother Nathan I
[2:15:50] all these thoughts of worth all these
[2:15:52] thoughts of Merit all these thoughts of
[2:15:54] earning it and
[2:15:56] and and
[2:15:57] comparing oh but uh but but I'm not
[2:16:00] jumping like he was when he got it I'm
[2:16:02] not shouting like he was when he got it
[2:16:05] [Music]
[2:16:07] but that's not that's that relative
[2:16:09] value
[2:16:11] but just to know that it's promised to
[2:16:13] you
[2:16:15] promise to you say brother Nathan I want
[2:16:18] the Holy Ghost so bad
[2:16:20] but I just can't get over that
[2:16:23] I can't get over that that that that
[2:16:26] just that lack of self-worth that
[2:16:29] complex that that fear that holds me
[2:16:30] back I just can't break through that to
[2:16:32] just believe that it's for me
[2:16:35] but doesn't it help you to really to
[2:16:37] know that brother Braham said God wants
[2:16:39] to give you the Holy Ghost more than you
[2:16:42] could desire it
[2:16:43] so if there's something burning in your
[2:16:45] heart saying brother Nathan I want to be
[2:16:47] part of this work I want the I want to
[2:16:48] be part I want meaning I want purpose I
[2:16:50] want reality I don't want to be a fence
[2:16:52] writer I don't want to just Philip you I
[2:16:54] want to be part of this message I want
[2:16:57] to be born into this Kingdom
[2:16:59] amen then it's only evidence that God
[2:17:02] wants it
[2:17:03] he wants it so bad he's wanted it for
[2:17:06] since before the foundation of the earth
[2:17:08] I would invite you to come as we sing
[2:17:10] tonight and receive it maybe you've got
[2:17:13] the Holy Ghost but you have been living
[2:17:14] so far below your privileges and you've
[2:17:17] had that false humility you've had that
[2:17:18] Pride that won't let you it just won't
[2:17:21] let you believe it won't let you accept
[2:17:22] what God thinks about you you'd rather
[2:17:24] stay with your complexes
[2:17:26] you'd rather stay with your lack of
[2:17:28] self-worth you'd rather stay with your
[2:17:30] fear
[2:17:31] than enter into his presence and let him
[2:17:33] lavish his love on you amen then why not
[2:17:35] lay it down today
