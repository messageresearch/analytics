said oh it's just another cycle I want to just say the minute that comes dismiss it just drop it because that's his tactic and I say healing has come healing is here and it's a settled it's a finished work so I just want to say stand your ground this is not like any other time this was God meeting us and I say there was too much invested for us to go back we're not going back so I wanted to say God

the other churches that have come those from Saskatchewan from British Columbia those that have come from the USA especially want to thank brother Jerry for the Jerry and I work together we're separate churches but we work together in the ministry and you ought to be thankful for that because [Applause] be glad brother Jerry and I work together in the ministry could you imagine if we worked together in song I mean anyway it's a blessing to be here I I think we have witnessed the life of the message the life of the message in a young man brother Nathan if you haven't had opportunity to listen to any of his Services they are archived I think you will be immensely blessed and if if the thermometer of the message is in the Youth of the message I will just say this message is in good hands so I thank you brother Nathan God bless you I want to thank the Lord for brother on and sister Connie Spencer who have given their lives for this message I thank the Lord for the gift he's bestowed on our brother Ron not just the gift but the heart the Zeal the passion the love the example that we can all identify with and I want to just say I do not take this lightly this is not just a regular thing while brother Ron's going to come and no this this was the Lord Jesus extending himself through this couple to us and brother thank you foreign [Applause] and to show the life of the message we're going to hear from a brother that is a general is I think of of somebody who can address us from a perspective very few can and I will say we if The Minister's meeting was an indication we were we were in another place yesterday and I don't say that to put pressure on you brother Ray you just be yourself and I say I love you with all my heart and I thank you for coming and and we want to remember Brother Ray he has also come at sacrifices wife sister Ruth is at home she's not in good health and he's come here and I want us if you can remember Sister Ruth in prayer he's also got other needs in his family he's got a daughter I just say when you're in prayer sometime maybe not today but in the days to come just whisper their names and the Lord will hear that can we do that I'm not going to keep you any longer let's just sing Wonderful Merciful Savior I think he's been wonderful to us we're going to invite brother Ray to come this morning [Music] who thought that the lamb good rescue the soul of mine [Music] foreign [Music] embrace our hearts always [Music] Faithfully loving [Music] hearing are we [Music] before [Music] oh we're falling before your throne you are the one you are the one that we pray you are the one we adore you give [Applause] [Music] him number for [Music] God bless you folks this morning it's wonderful to be in his presence and I think I thank God for the opportunity to be here you may be seated for a moment please I'd like to make a few comments before I minister I want to thank brother Ed this morning for the invitation to be here it's very humbling to me and when he called and said that he asked about if I'd be willing to come he said I'd like to have your grandson and brother Ron and when he said that it just did something to me and I I said wow I got to pray about this I just felt to come as a great honor be with brother Ron my friend my brother and Nathan my grandson I believe Nathan has a real future ahead of him I I just thank God for the call of God's life and all the Sons and Daughters of God I was hearing something came to me in the uh Motel this morning I shared with the brothers in the office but in these meetings I was thinking if brother Brown could come back and see what took place here in these meetings and the quality and the love I mean I've experienced such love here Divine love more than feel your love Divine love the prophet of God you remember how disappointed he got and standing in the gap he said nobody's receiving my message but I'm looking at a group of people this morning I'm looking up the whole host of people that are and I I want to speak on it this morning a bit but a whole host of people that believe this message and not only Sadie believe it but they live it so I thank God for that this morning yes I'm very sorry that my wife cannot come she'd love to be here you know we've been here several times and uh this says this this a congregation in the ministry here have a special place in my heart I thank God I also am happy to have Brian Lucille with me this morning on this trip if there ever were two Christians they're really Christians and uh and Brian he works he I think he worked 39 years so far in the United Airlines so the other night when we missed our flight and and Denver and we had to take a motel so I just went to bed he did the work so it looked like we had to go to Phoenix and then from Phoenix to Calgary not even make it in here and then uh three o'clock in the morning he knocks on my door and he said Brother Ray I mean dad go back to sleep that flight isn't going to work but by his grace we made it by his grace we made it if you don't mind standing this morning and uh go to the scripture Luke 21 I'd like to I think they might have well they haven't got it so far but I've been ministering probably for the last uh three four five months on the subject and I might do a little bit uh maybe a teaching type maybe this morning a little bit and I've been on a subject called The Secret of his coming and uh I just want to go to the scripture and see here beginning with verse 25 Luke chapter 21. and there shall be signs in the Sun and then the moon and in the Stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts fallen in failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great Glory how many believe we had a cloud and we didn't see his feet we saw his head [Music] so his headship is here [Music] but amen it had to be more than the headship he had to have a body oh yeah I'm going to raise your hands on the body we might as well have church you know I am got the energy to puritulate these fellas and you know but you have to you know if you amen once with them you amen twice for me and when these things begin to come to pass then look up lift up your heads for your Redemption draw nigh how many is thank God for Redemption but how many things God for your full adoption when we get our change [Applause] Hallelujah and he speak with him in the parable behold the Fig Tree and all the trees fig tree is Israel all the trees brother Benham says was a World Council of churches and United Nations and when they shall shoot forth see no of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand so likewise when you see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is an eye at hand that's not speaking about the kingdom of God within you that's talking about the kingdom set on Earth and merely I send you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away one more scripture please Matthew 24 verse 1. this is where I'm drawing my subject this morning foreign verse 1 please and Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for show him the building of the Temple and Jesus said unto them see not all these things verily I sent to you there shall not be one stone upon another that shall be thrown down and as he said upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying just to look at it he's coming privately sounds like the seventh seal saying tell us When shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world I want to dwell on those two things the sign of thy coming and the end of the world sign I want to put it as the end of the world sign God bless you as you may be seated I probably do I trust it's okay but I'll probably be reading quite a few quotes we'll just see as the Lord leads but I want to start out with this one from crisis to mystery he said no God had a purpose in the hidden Mystery and that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how it's unfolded itself right down to the present hour that we're living then you will understand clearly listen to this now then you will understand clearly I believe what is being done God's great mystery it's a secret it's kept he kept it a secret nobody knowed about it even the angels didn't understand it think about it even the angels didn't understand it it's a secret my are you a blessed people I'm telling you we're blessed people because not even the angels know what was coming forth but you're sitting here this morning because of restored word and you are catching a secret that was in the back part of God's mind [Applause] brother if you could please keep the monetary up just a little bit more not not a lot but just a little please amen so I I want to uh say something this morning that uh Paul when he was speaking in the Corinthian Church in the first chapter of Corinthians if you have a Scofield bible and uh and Schofield of course we don't take all of his footnotes but I thought this really compared with the with the message that uh and and it speaks about uh there's three Greek words that pertain to his coming and the first one and I know it's a little scary now because what happened in the message but it's actually a parasia which is his personal presence very simple his personal presence amen and then the second one is apocalypse which we are very familiar with Beyond failing unveiling of the word or revelation then the third word is epiphania no I'm not a Greek scholar so amen which represents the manifestation of that revelation can a hearing amen so we see this morning that amen their takes a great Revelation to understand who you are and his personal presence is more than just a feeling let me share with the prophet of God said he sent my Ministry my Ministry is a different Ministry from a pastor or a teacher he said my Ministry is to declare that he is here [Applause] Hallelujah he is here [Applause] he's not just coming he's here [Music] and the ministry proved it by more than just saying he's here [Applause] it's the same with brother wrong Ministry the other night I felt the presence standing right here [Applause] and you saw what happened it was his personal presence brother I'm still laboring a little bit please if you can give me a little more sorry about that so we uh I want to so I'd rather read quotes I mean we're message Believers right I'm not an evangelist uh you know and I just have to be what I am as a you know oh incidentally I forgot to to greet you from our true word Tabernacle and our our pastor brother Wayne Lawson I I'm I'm the senior now whoa I'm that senior pastor I guess when you're 84 you can be this is one quote this is absolutely astounding to me it comes from I believe from the seed of discrepancy the word becoming alive in our own flesh that shows the presence of God so uh we are sitting in the presence of God because his presence his Revelation his calling his seed his germ is in you and I [Applause] is that okay amen that's not false Doctrine that's real that he's alive in this bride today it's changed from the prophet to the prophecy and we are living out the prophecy of the Bride of Jesus Christ we're not living out Luther's day Wesley's day Pentecost we absolutely living out the coming of the Lord [Applause] we have to recognize this morning there's a bride coming and the son of man has been waved over the church again in the full maturity of the word in its full of power [Applause] he believed that so we must come in order to be in the rapture we must come to a mature bride we are not Pentecostal babies [Applause] amen we must come to the revelation absolutely that we are the representation of Jesus Christ on Earth [Applause] don't ever forget Who You Are you're more than son or a daughter of an Earthly parent but you got a Heavenly parents Hallelujah so there's another quote the presence of God unrecognized he said we could only realize that is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose that's to release our desires that we have in him to us but we got to recognize his presence and now how do you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifested you look at Psalms chapter 1 verse I believe it's seven it's his fruit in his season it's his fruit in his season so we are at the season of the change of our bodies [Music] I want to notify you you got the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] the Rapture is already in you Hallelujah if you oh Glory if you got the Holy Ghost the Rapture the rapture healing the difference the joy the peace [Applause] hallelujah it's already in you [Applause] it's not going to come his hands arrived whoa [Applause] I got I got a scripture for that in case you say well back it up and about I can it's Romans 8. verse 30. [Applause] when you're predestinated if you're predestinated in whom is predestinated they are called [Applause] and when you're called you are Justified and when you adjust the whole glory and when you're Justified you are already gone as high let's get my praise offering come on let's get my face off come on let's give them a place come on let's give him a praise offered hallelujah hallelujah [Music] Blessed Be His holy name [Applause] I want to share something with you because the revelation of the revelation of the or I mean the Rapture I'm sorry is a revelation [Applause] the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you so if he could give you a revelation of the new birth personally can he not also give you the revelation of the rapture [Applause] that kind of got fresh [Applause] absolutely if we can rest in it [Applause] if we can rest in it now brother bam says it's going to take more faith in this age than there's ever been but because he's going to take more faith how does faith come by hearing so don't worry the little flock he gave us more word he gave us the Original Seed and when you give this The Original Seed he'll give us original faith [Applause] so brother random said don't worry it'll be there [Applause] Hallelujah so when we see now folks how close we're Nearing our Exodus remember the first Exodus was going from a natural land to another natural land second Exodus going from a spiritual condition to the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Third Exodus is going from the baptism of the Holy Ghost taking us into the Millennium and the great hereafter [Applause] so did he not perform the first one and the second one and the one that descended for us will do the third one [Applause] we're just talking in the back room you know that brother Ron brought up about you know uh you know we're not Canadians we're not Americans some are loud some are soft but you're fun to preach for and I can tell you where none of those were a kingdom of God Hallelujah and I tell you what brother Madam said there's a one place you go to heaven you'll be shouting and praising the Lord you go to hell you'll be gnashing your teeth it's the quietest place you'll ever be so wherever Jesus is this noise [Applause] I know some of you might get nervous of that but now I wanted to slow up a little bit here I got a lot on my mind but uh we only got much so much time but you know when you look at it in order for us to have a millennium there has to be a cleansing of this Earth Brother Band talks in the future home about the Redemption plan for a human and the Redemption plan for an earth so when I remember I'm speaking about the signs of his coming in the sign of the end our sign is not what's all going on out here but it's a part of the modern events made clear by prophecy you following me our sign was a resurrection sign absolutely he showed himself through a little Kentuckian in order to have the coming of the lord we had to have a Ministry that would be like that Ministry but brother Benham said he had more success he had lost success in my Ministry than he even had in his you got quiet on him that's a quote he's not saying I did it is saying he it's not rather Ron Spencer that does these things it's he [Applause] it's not brother Ed that does these things it's he it's not me it's not you it's he [Applause] let me read here from the so when we see here from the seventh seal brother Ben was talking about the coming of the Lord and I'll just add do some paraphrase in here but you'll see here that he's looking at this this secret coming and he said one thing about it Satan does not understand this he said he can be mimic verse Paul second Paul but the third poll [Applause] the third poll is a secret that the devil will never get it [Applause] and then he said in Christ there's a mystery page 58. he said this hidden Mystery the seven seal this coming of the Lord is in the heart it's in the heart of the believer [Applause] someone that's in the heart of the believer it's slowly changing us [Applause] from Glory to glory to glory to glory [Applause] until we're in glory [Applause] oh yeah I say Glory [Applause] if I can quote here from the seventh seal he said but remember in that part I'm going to a different part of the seven seal but in that part he's saying now the signs will also show it the signs will also short in paragraph 231 of the seventh seal now remember this seven seal is the end of time it's the end of all things the things written in the sentence seal books seal up of the Plan of Redemption from before the foundation of the world it every bit ends It's The End of struggling world [Music] it's the end of struggling nature it's the end of everything [Applause] it's even the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials you know I want to just show you there in the vials revelation 16. you say brother Mann never got a chance to preach on it no I know he wanted to preach on it but if you study the scriptures and you study the message you see he did preach on it because if you read all of those vials listen if there's a church age there has to be a vial there has to be a judgment right so if you read that scripture I believe if I'm writing in Revelation 16 of the last verse that's taken them because of those vials is taken into the Armageddon are you following me so amen there is there is two cleansings there has to be a cleansing for the millennium [Applause] and there has to be after Satan is loosed for a season there's another cleansing I believe and I could be wrong but I don't believe so the first cleansing will be atomic fire [Music] [Applause] that cleanses sir the other one will be Heavenly Fire so listen if you want a millennium to Reign him you got to realize God has got to purify this Earth and brother Brandon was seen here even it's the end of the vials and it's even the ushering in of the millennium is that true now if you go to Revelation chapter seven please if you have your Bibles or if you don't just um I'm sure they'll have it on the screen foreign and after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the Earth yet the wind should not blow on the earth no on the sea nor on any tree who's in control Russia thinks they're in control America thinks you're in control God's in control and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea remember now those winds are war or strife saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees that we have seal the Servants of God in their foreheads that's not Gentiles that's Jews so you realize amen it's not that we're we're worried about the Earth blowing up or burning up the bride has an exodus the bride does not have to go through judgment or tribulation he's already been judged [Applause] in fact her judge is also the jury and the jury and the judge worked together and declared this bride is not guilty [Applause] Hallelujah you had your Jubilee you're not a slave anymore [Applause] [Music] you can have listen you can walk without condemnation because you are in Christ [Applause] [Music] said all right if I do a little bit of our reading I've got some things I just on the heart amen I just got something in my heart amen in Christ there's a mystery of God revealed he said then we can see that the marriage suffers at hand [Applause] not if I never see you again remember the marriage suppers at hand and then the kingdom according to the promise is ready to be issued in God I got a little bit ahead of myself there but in Christ there's a mystery there's a three-fold manner of his coming the first was in Christ the second I'd like to read it because it it I can't remember the words in Christ the second one is the preeminence in The Bride of Jesus Christ in other words he's looking not only for those that are learners but the manifestation [Music] the epiphania not just the revelation [Applause] and the third one is the kingdom to be set up here on Earth whoa you know what don't worry what place you got he's got one for you you will not miss this flight hallelujah look at each other and say I will not miss this flight [Applause] your favorite your favorite Airlines better be United right Brian they don't hold a candle to this or Delta he said now then the kingdom according to the promise already be issued in the great millennium taken up of the church and the destroying of the wicked the world under the Sixth Seal remember that's the Judgment seal to be purified by volcanic take all the corruption the sin of the world and to mold her out again and bring forth a new millennium for the age that is to come and when we see all these three full revelation God in Christ Christ in the church the kingdom coming Adam and Eve redeemed back to the Garden of Eden in the representation of Christ and the bride then the kingdom is going to be restored again to his promise you remember in Revelations there's three wolves first of all was the first World War I'm trying to show you something that this Earth is going to be the way it is until he calls for it as long as he's got seed here as long as she's got Sons and Daughters to come yet every one of his seeds must be on display [Music] he's incomplete that sounds crazy but he's incomplete without everyone of his attributes and you never have to worry about somebody taking your place [Applause] brother minnow and even at our age we got it made if we go before or come after we'll be there don't tell us that we're 80s inside is an 18 year old brother men will give me a hit thumbs up president was talking about this first World War holding back the Four Winds it ended on the 11th month lemon tea 11th Hour something supernaturally took place that war was from 1914 to 1918. second world war second war the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 416 800 soldiers died 1906 to 1909 was Azusa Street Revival brother Branham was born April 6 1909 that's correct isn't it I believe yes it's just been one thing there's wars and rumors of wars you remember in Matthew 24 all seven seals are listed in there foreign all seven seals are listed in Matthew 24. amen so the the Clock Was ticking what was it brother Benham said I forget was it 12 minutes before midnight something like that I just heard about two or three four months back somebody said it's nine seconds before midnight nine seconds think about this in the 60s I didn't get the the year right I think it's 1962. the Cuban crisis the missile crisis took place 35-day standoff Mr Kennedy was the president of the United States nuclear missile sites were built in Cuba by the Soviet Union it was that close even as a young boy it's a young man I didn't realize how close it was to the missiles being sent on towards North America but the Four Winds the angel is still here the bride is still here you don't realize how important you are to the kingdom [Applause] you don't realize how important you are even to the unbeliever because it gives them a little more time to repent [Applause] praise the Lord [Applause] I read well it'll only take 30 minutes for a Miss of the fly between Russia and the United States from a submarine 10 to 15 minutes to Launch and be at his destination I want to show you something not that you don't know it but this Earth is in birth pains it's no time to play Church it's no time to get your lines Tangled time to say God if there's anything wrong with me [Applause] take it out reveal it to me remember this Rapture is not taking the world we can't be half believer and half unbeliever remember the seven Visions I'm not going to go all through them but the sixth one just imagine how that was made manifest where a vice president was brought into the vote and became vice president a woman a woman with brother Ben and Saul I don't want to go I don't have time to go through all of them one of them says watch Russia watch Russia keep an eye on the North you realize when brother bam said to Russia going down for the oil you know they're in oil country right now they even have oil but they're in oil country right now do you realize in Syria we have Russia America and are telling how many other Nations so we see here that everything and he said the last in seven Vision I heard the most terrible explosion as I turned a look I saw nothing but degree in craters and smoke all over the place speaking about vials speaking about ungodly things brother men said in leadership he said oh God let me go don't don't let me go don't don't leave me behind Jesus let me go with you father I don't want to stay here on this Earth to watch all these tribulations come on I don't want to stay here for this insanity right right you mean he was calling that Insanity then what have we got now when you call good bad and bad good don't even know what gender I don't want to get into all these things but I tell you we are seen Insanity like we've never seen it but you know what that means we're not going down folks we're ready to go up [Applause] he said it they'll go so insane until locusts raise up like women to the hunt to women that's Revelations also mental condition of people will be completely gone we see it making it right now right now in 1962 brother Benham was relating to something in the spoken word is the Original Seed and he said there was three seeds planted you remember that three seeds planted he said there was a denominational seed by Billy Graham and then there was a Pentecostal seed planted by Oral Roberts but then there was a word seed that had been planted a word said now if you understand he said folks and say there's no more or less God tells me I want you to get this good and clear three seeds has been planted he talks about a Mariah rain teaching rain he talks about a harvest rain he said Billy Graham has struck the world Pentecostals have struck the world and the word has struck the world right so he said now then the kind of seed you plant it in your field will be the kind of crop you will reap so it's important as we as ministers plant the right seed [Applause] is that true now brother man was saying it's dying down it's dying down 1962. it's dying down already the seed has been planted but wait a while hang on a minute he said in the message in 1962 in the present stage of our man Ministry you know he quoted out of second Timothy chapter four as Paul was speaking demons hath forsaken me [Applause] and it looked like Paul had lost his power when he give away his cloak and they're trying to run them out of town are you all with me I know you're maybe a little tired but may you get the quickening power so brother abandonment saying they're saying that I'm washed up but he wasn't washed up he was far from being washed up there was time oh Lord it was time now he's going to be stepping into his new ministry and in order to have a matured seed they're after him step into the third pole [Applause] and that third poll was the opening of the workers [Music] and even though he had a Moses Ministry and he Delights the ministry he needed a Joshua Ministry [Applause] is that right whole glory to God [Applause] eat from his listen Timothy you time now second Timothy chapter four it says do the work of an evangelist it didn't mean that Paul was an evangelist didn't mean brother Ben was the Evangelist do the work of evangelists [Applause] so what was it doing it was pulling the seed but it wasn't maturing the seed it was fully deceived but it wasn't mature in the seed [Music] say praise the Lord so there had to be that brother Branham or remember what he said there he said I trust the Lord will help me take this word and clothe the bride [Applause] take this word and clothe the bride I thought he already had the word B did have but there had to be a opening [Music] you know why you see his coming it's right in the message the rising of its son of son I can't read all these quotes they're so beautiful that's why I like to just lay it out the way he tells it amen man I'm going to tell you what he said the quickening power let you see his coming [Applause] is that right do you see us coming and you got the quickening power and he can Cricket every promise [Applause] listen people don't get a denominational understanding of the coming [Applause] there's no mystery to that where they're going to be flying out of airplanes and jumping out of cars it's a secret now brother Ray oh two rays on the scene Brother Ray you tell your wife things you never told somebody else yeah brother brother Ron you tell sister Connie you'd never tell somebody else that's the same with our Christ [Applause] I tell you what [Applause] he took his love secrets that he had before the foundation of the world and even this morning he's whispering even this morning he's whispering his love secrets come away my love come away my love come away my fear Fair one and because you're his wife he'll never keep one Revelation from you [Applause] brother random said he didn't whisper to the flirters [Applause] he whispered to his sons and daughters [Applause] I tell you what if you're down in your spirit this morning may God lift you up [Applause] [Music] I tell you what we've had a refreshing in the present this weekend don't let it slit from you [Applause] glory to God don't you love him this morning the word that's been planted is the word of promised don't ever let it drop from you I'm just pausing for a moment here I'm trying to see what to do but anyway let me see if I can find the scripture I was looking for something but if I can just find it quickly here let's turn to Joshua Joshua the first chapter Joshua the first chapter just a couple verses there say Amen when you're there now after the death of Moses the sermon of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spoke unto Joshua the son of none Moses ministers saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people onto the land which I do give them even to the children of Israel Grace had taken over the law is dead Grace listen legalism I'll never bring you there Grace will take you in so Moses I'm going to read verse 2 again Moses my sermon is dead but his message still lived [Applause] [Music] his message didn't go down Moses my servant brother Branham my prophet has gone on but his message is not dead [Applause] in fact it's more alive today than when the Moses or Elijah was here yes sir amen it's more alive today because he's got a many-membered body not just one man [Music] keep your eyes on that verse two for a moment Moses my sermon isn't here now therefore arise go over Jordan if you look it up the word Jordan in the Hebrew it means descending and we had first Thessalonians chapter four the Lord himself descended with a shout so the word Crossing into Jordan means Crossing into revelation [Applause] and at that appearing the seven angel had to be on earth at the same time right so when he tore off that seal glory to God he had to have somebody to send it down to [Applause] him and he called a man with him random born to a Kentucky hillbilly a bootlegger dad [Applause] that's why I thank God he could oh my God I could have a chance to be called [Music] listen you people if you can keep your testimony you young people keep your testimony don't come back with a testimony I got off drugs and I got off alcohol I got off smoking keep yourself here [Applause] but I wasn't able to I smoked I cursed I hope they don't stumble somebody me preaching but God rich in Mercy [Applause] call me and I answered [Applause] [Music] I know what it means to be redeemed [Applause] to remember Redemption is in two parts coming out and going in and we had to have a Joshua Ministry to go in let me read a quote please God called man am I still open my own time he said God is calling men and women today if I asked him that 20 minutes Lee hopefully you'll stay the same God has calling men and women today to the battlefield he's not calling them to a gilgall neither is he calling them to a Jericho or a Bethel but he's calling them the Cross Jordan so he can get you out into a school of his own power and make you enmold you look what he's doing right here now sending down the spirit of his son he is performing signs and wonders and miracles which the world hasn't seen the last 2000 years scientific world has caught the picture of it the pillar of fire the angel of the Lord hangs in Washington D.C tonight of the Hall of religious art the only supernatural being was ever scientifically proven to be photographed he puts forth his same signs and wonders what is it it's Crossing Jordan [Applause] is Crossing Jordan one Revelation at a time when the Revelation at the time are you following me remember there's two signs for sure that the Rapture is getting closer and brother Ben said oh if the church only knew its position if the church only knew its position the Rapture would grow the Rapture would go another one he is saying when you see the headship of the body becoming one in the fullness of the measure of his manifestation that's the epiphania manifestation shows that the body is about ready to be received to the headship and then he goes on to the next paragraph talking about Israel nations are breaking Israel's Awakening so you see people even Israel today it's not necessarily a sign to us but it's a sign of the time they are surrounded by enemies and the nation of Iran is declaring openly we want to destroy that Nation I got news for them [Applause] [Music] they haven't read the book that I read [Applause] and it's the same with you when the oh when the Devil comes to you and say you ain't going to make it you tell that devil you ain't written my book [Applause] why don't we get my praise offering again [Applause] Glory because listen all that's in the book is him and you can't destroy him [Applause] My Flesh I will see God [Applause] Hallelujah you know some days when you wake up you might not feel like you're in a victory at all they got news for you you are his victory so when the Gloom and the depression try to come upon you and anxiety you just put something on your refrigerator you put that cord on the refrigerator I am God's victory [Applause] and tell the devil like Brethren Ron tells boo brother Ben said in the mirror to divorce and I'm not ministering my marriage and divorces don't get shook and so is it with the church well he's talking about I'm sorry you're going to back up a little he's actually talking about Esther now the queen had refused the king and God chose Esther and so is it with the church that refuses to become impregnated in the age that we now live in to bring forth children of this age now listen I've been a farmer in my young days you take a wheat field we never grew as much wheat in Minnesota we did first couple years I farmed I did but it seemed like it didn't Thrive there and when it comes Harvest Time close to harvest you look over the field but you got to do more than just look over the field you got to go in the field and you'll never Harvest that wheat until it's all golden grain and that's why brother mom said we gotta lay in the presence of the Sun that's not the s-u-n-s-o-n until all the greenness all our traditions even in the message we got Traditions sometimes that don't belong in the message it never was in the message is that right I'm going to tell you all the greekness has got to go on out of us but we saw a matured seed in a man called William Branham we saw and adopted son of God and he's in the field [Music] so in order to listen if he's in the well of course I appreciate what is a year ago two years ago Nathan I don't know I preached in the Homeland it wasn't just about Israel but the man said our homeland is the message come on if you're wondering away and trying to figure this out come back to home [Applause] how do you like that I forgot my thought you guys been listening come home yeah come home I know the pope is not supposed to be joking but I've done it for years so you see here he said oh yes I know where I'm at now here we see I'm a church Son of God so in that field there's got to be more it has nothing to do with your Earthly age [Applause] it has to do what you're placing [Music] come on people that's to do with your placing you know you got to be more than just one again you got to be pleased so brother Benham was saying first wave sheave [Applause] that came to maternity in this church right now brother cherry and this is something right now there's adopted people [Applause] in this assembly it's all of the field but don't worry there's not going to be a harvest until we all come to maturity [Applause] I had a neighbor one time I used to be a farmer and he had a farmer Namer and he worked he was a worker and when fall season he put he dumped all this wet corn in the bin they're supposed to be drying whatever ended up he must have not watched the whole been spoiled the bride is not going to go that way there's going to be enough preaching by the five-fold ministry they're going to take this word and they're going to preach it unadulterated [Applause] and they're going to preach the Original Seed and they're going to pray they're going to preach more than just brother Ben I'm a prophet they're going to tell you who you are [Applause] they're gonna tell you your name is written look [Applause] you'll never mature you'll never mature sitting under a ministry that's not willing to bring you all the word [Applause] remember whichever way the tree falls leans rather that's how it falls I want to go on with this quote he said we got to be children of this age to the pregnancy of the word of God you bring forth a child of this age and he's seeing a seed child not the stock not the tassel not the shock remember that was a good shock but I'll tell you what you know when the green dries is when the shuck pulls away now we're not here to call anybody shuck God will take care of that [Applause] but inside of there is the real train [Applause] Hallelujah I'm looking I'm looking at real golden grain word [Applause] [Music] it's time to mature get over the pity things it's just carnal do it what is Right according to the word [Applause] if you give me about 10 minutes can you do that please 10 minutes and we'll close but you see here brother Benjamin said unveiling of God the same Pillar of Fire they come upon those men that wrote the Bible it's the same Pillar of Fire here today interpreting the Bible [Applause] you know God is his own interpreter we don't have to make it come to pass we can't do it anyway he'll bring it to pass in his right time he said how we thank him what a comfort what an identification I'm so glad to be identified in that I don't know what to do I'd rather be identified than that than all the Baptist and methodists and Presbyterians and lutherans all the rest of them identified in that word where that's Shekinah Glory and Revelation Lays the pillar of fire is appearing visibly Among Us he still is identifying that the message is right [Music] what more do we need for identification I mean I mean even up there in Sabina Canyon Tucson he wrote the letter ego in the rock [Music] is Eagle age come on now he even let that all happen to the erosion and such on Sunset Mountain that's actually the display of brother Branham have you seen it you're real quiet on me I don't know if you saw it or not it's absolutely see brother Brown's profile no I'm not a fanatic but I'm telling you what we don't need any more signs to show us that this is the truth right now you are the greatest sign overlooked foreign you are the greatest sign overlooked right now [Applause] we were the nobodies in this world but we were the somebody's to him and he likes to take people and mold them well I don't know if you get up in the morning say hallelujah I want molding I say you need prayer because it comes anyway and I haven't always liked it and choosing of the right brother Adam said that molding will come by the the word of this age but you know it comes more than just hearing the word that mosia it's experience [Applause] invisible union soon closing foreign ERS won't make it I'm doubtful the god to be a thankful I'm thankful to God to be living in this time of the closing scenes of world's history I know if I would have had to see so before the foundation of the world if God would have laid out the whole program to me and said to me I want you to preach and now what age do you desire to go to Earth to preach I would have chose this age for I think this is the Golden Age [Applause] I certainly would have loved to been here than to turn the time of his visit to the Earth but still I think this right now is a greater time because it's a time that he's coming to take the people that is redeemed nearing the resurrection when all the redeem will come forth what a glorious opportunity we have to speak to a dying people [Applause] and we know that history is closing out in world's history will soon be over then we're going to step into a new day the great millennium let's bow our heads you've been such a kind audience I love you with all my heart you know Saints I've experienced they're just so much encouragement while being here not just hearing the word but some of you coming up to me and talking to me encouraging words to me that's what we felt here the love of God and the unity of the people that is a fulfillment of the message you know it doesn't make any difference what anybody has done it doesn't make any difference what somebody said I'll just give you a little instance I just recently heard brother Perry Green's testimony up at brother biscos many years ago and I want to be careful I do I say it right but brother green was riding with brother Benham brother random was telling about some things that had happened in a certain group of people and whether random was just laying it out for about two hours but they came to a place to stop for breakfast and he was talking about these brothers and so on what was wrong they were going to stop for breakfast and they ate breakfast and brother Branham turned to brother green and said what time is it brother Perry he told him the time he said well we're close enough now we can go and see those Brothers and brother green turned to him and said brother Brandon I don't understand you mean you've been telling me about what's all wrong there and you're going to go and see me and brother Benham turned to brother green and said I thought brother green you'd understand so no matter what has gone wrong where you've had difficulties with Ministries or people Never Lose Your Love Never Lose Your Love because that's what will make the difference I didn't bring the quote I read it at home but brother Benham was talking he said even if a brother is unscriptural I can't remember the words for words even on scriptural but love will override everything I don't know maybe I'm going this way for a reason [Music] so love of God is powerful [Music] forgiveness is powerful [Applause] you hear Brother Ray you're spoiling the servant no I'm not I believe the Lord is talking don't lift nothing listen people don't get on the internet and see what's all wrong what you think is wrong with the message garbage but you know what happened to me the other day and I didn't have a long discussion with him but this brother called me out of the blue I haven't heard from here for years and told me how he loved me and I know that I've heard I didn't want to get in the discussion with him I had heard he had left the word and he's a minister I never even brought it up because he said you know military I pray for you all the time I say God give me that Divine love give us that Divine love that will overcome all things can you say Amen are you with me Divine love is great [Music] Hallelujah let's pray together once again once again once again raise your hands if you have a need just graze your hands and every need don't you believe he's present here brother Brown said on this side now I'm not talking about the Millennium on this side don't look for the nail scarred hand person or the one that can bring blood he said now he's enthroned in his people that's good will you believe then when you got your hand raised Lord Jesus how we love you this morning how we love you with all our hearts and we love one another oh God [Music] one of these mornings one of these days you'll be the last sweep [Music] and just like we felt a sweep in these meetings there'll be a final sweep and every modical monocle Adam fiber will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye [Music] we listen oh God just just listen oh God we're listening to you we're listening to you just whisper just whisper some more secrets [Music] there are a few more to us to change us take us in your hands take us in your loving care just take us Lord and just hug us into your bosom Lord we're all yours we surrender our whole being to you Lord I'm an old man Lord I know the prophet said at 50 he was an old man but I'm really an old man I don't know I thank you for the health you've given me but I don't know if I'm even Way Beyond The Promise others in this congregation are Beyond The Promise but Lord [Music] you'll not take of one of us until we've served your purpose Lord would you bless these people would you bless the ministry here would you bless their wives would you bless the office of this church there's such lovely men [Music] God forgive us where we fall in short cleanse us of all unrighteousness [Music] Lord I'm so thankful you spoke for me not that I had to preach but you spoke for me to come and hearing brother Nathan and brother Ron [Music] it just blessed my soul [Music] touch the needs of those that Rose they raised their hand oh God touch their lives to God foreign take away all the disappointments [Music] pick away the heartache Lord May the healing balm of Gideon touch every need we love you we praise you Lord if I say anything on this forgive me Lord I wouldn't mean to do that God there's there's such a presence of you here [Music] I know brother Branham talked about two different presents one is when we shout we dance we run the aisles and other times he said it's just so so awesome that you don't say a word [Music] Lord I've had moments like that and I've had moments of shouting they're both wonderful take care of people here as we love you in Jesus name amen I I don't really have a song but if you got a song can you sing that one again
