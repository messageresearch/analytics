[27:34] brother Paul would you come and open in
[27:36] a word of prayer brother Paul Dirksen I
[27:38] don't have any written needs tonight but
[27:41] I believe we're serving a God that all
[27:44] things are possible
[27:46] in this presence it's charged I don't
[27:48] know what it feels like out there it's
[27:49] charged up here
[27:51] God is here let's reach out and claim
[27:54] every promise that we have take him at
[27:56] his word
[27:57] let's worship him tonight
[28:04] what an honor and a privilege to gather
[28:06] in his presence
[28:08] each one of us having brought our
[28:10] portion
[28:11] brother random says each one bringing
[28:12] that lick of fire he says then amongst
[28:14] us we have the pillar of Fire
[28:16] and that's what it's all about let's
[28:18] just welcome the Lord again tonight
[28:21] Heavenly Father we truly want to be here
[28:25] and abide in your presence as that song
[28:27] that we just sang would Express
[28:29] Lord there's nothing that this world has
[28:32] to offer that even can compare with what
[28:35] we have in you Lord
[28:37] it's such a blessing and an honor to to
[28:39] feel your presence and then to to know
[28:41] that you're working in our hearts
[28:43] changing us molding us into what you
[28:45] would have us to be
[28:47] Lord even as we heard last night
[28:50] father how that we need to recognize Who
[28:53] We Are
[28:55] and father I just was struck how that
[28:58] the reason that we don't know that Lord
[29:00] it is he says it's just because of fear
[29:03] and how that the church needs more of
[29:05] that love that there'd be no place for
[29:06] that fear so Lord that's my request
[29:09] tonight Lord that you would just pour
[29:11] out your love Upon Us Lord we'd have a
[29:13] greater love for you for your word for
[29:15] one another and Lord that you would have
[29:18] the freedom then to move in our midst
[29:19] and accomplish what you have purposed
[29:21] tonight Lord be with our worship may you
[29:24] be honored and glorified and we pray for
[29:26] the speaker tonight Lord that you would
[29:28] use him may we do our part father to
[29:30] pull from you what we have need of we
[29:33] committed all to you we give you the

[49:48] praise the Lord I was
[49:51] you know when we think about that I was

[49:54] the church age book he said never has
[49:56] there been a people
[49:58] who has been so beaten down so scored so
[50:02] I'm paraphrasing now but so rejected so

[50:49] pressure
[50:50] now seems so
[50:54] much greater
[50:57] I wonder
[50:59] Lord how came I stand
[51:05] and down
[51:08] on my knees at the foot of

[54:24] Hallelujah
[54:31] Hallelujah
[54:33] Hallelujah
[54:35] I will invite the brothers to come
[54:40] sing that song when believing isn't easy
[54:44] tonight last night we heard from a Young
[54:46] Man on Fire for God and what a
[54:48] masterpiece what a masterpiece deity
[54:51] isn't in heaven but deity is in you
[54:53] it isn't I believe tonight we're gonna
[54:55] we're gonna hear from the Lord through a
[54:58] walking miracle
[54:59] and I believe that you could look at
[55:02] this song and he could say of anyone
[55:03] when believing isn't easy to keep
[55:05] pressing forward to keep going forward
[55:08] let's all stand it's not hard to believe
[55:10] when you're standing on the mountain top
[55:13] it's not hard to believe
[55:17] standing on the mountain tops in glory
[55:27] when you can hear these songs of angels
[55:32] and the breeze from Heaven sends your
[55:36] spirit sorry
[55:37] [Applause]
[55:40] [Music]
[55:41] oh but in the valley once more
[55:47] will Jesus still be long that's the
[55:51] question
[55:55] because believe me
[55:58] cause believing when believing isn't
[56:03] easy there's a test that is the testing
[56:08] also we need faith
[56:10] [Music]
[56:14] faith for the time when the sun does not
[56:19] shine and the Mountaintop is just a
[56:24] memory
[56:25] [Music]
[56:27] there's no sign to be seen and I don't
[56:32] feel a thing or to the word of God Alone
[56:41] and I need strength for the day when
[56:47] troubles come my way and I just don't
[56:51] understand
[56:53] what it means
[56:57] that's when nothing else will do but
[57:00] faith faith alone will see me through
[57:04] and believing
[57:06] becomes my victory
[57:11] it's not hard to believe
[57:15] when things are going well and skies are
[57:20] sunny
[57:22] [Music]
[57:26] when you feel you're making progress
[57:31] [Music]
[57:45] or would you still keep the faith that's
[57:49] the question
[57:52] that's the question because
[57:58] [Music]
[58:04] testing I need strength I need faith I
[58:11] need faith for the time when the sun
[58:16] does not shine at the Mountaintop is
[58:21] just a memory
[58:24] when there's no sight to be seen and I
[58:30] don't feel a thing but to the word God
[58:35] Alone
[58:36] [Music]
[58:43] and when troubles come my way
[58:47] and I just don't understand what it
[58:51] means
[58:54] that's when nothing else
[59:02] and believing because my victory
[59:09] amen let's give the Lord a hand clap
[59:11] [Applause]
[59:25] Elijah was told
[59:28] arise and eat
[59:30] for the Journey's too great for you
[59:33] if we don't have him we're never going
[59:35] to make it
[59:37] if we don't feed if we don't water our
[59:39] faith
[59:40] that's what we're here to do this
[59:41] weekend
[59:43] you that are
[59:44] here and you've been
[59:46] in this pre-service and the singing
[59:49] you will know that in this room right
[59:51] now is not just the person sitting
[59:53] beside you
[59:54] but there are angels there's the
[59:56] presence of God
[59:58] and I just encourage you stay in this
[1:00:00] atmosphere through this service

[1:00:07] we we greet you we thank you for coming

[1:00:11] and God bless you
[1:00:14] listen why don't you have your seats for
[1:00:16] a moment I'm going to get nervous if I
[1:00:18] keep talking while you're standing
[1:00:19] so I'll probably keep be nervous while
[1:00:23] you're sitting too
[1:00:25] but that's okay
[1:00:27] so we've had some visitors come in I
[1:00:29] believe we've had some come in from
[1:00:31] Calgary brother Berry good to see you
[1:00:33] brother Toby I enjoyed that special and
[1:00:36] your brother like
[1:00:37] you do my your brother's mind coming on
[1:00:39] a preaching tour with me you can be my
[1:00:41] opening act and I'll I'll be okay people
[1:00:44] might not remember the preaching but
[1:00:45] they'll remember the singing
[1:00:47] and the sacks I love the sacks I'm kind
[1:00:49] of partial to the horn section myself
[1:00:51] but that's an inside joke for our
[1:00:53] congregation here so
[1:00:55] anyway we welcome you those from Calgary
[1:00:57] we've mentioned some from from
[1:01:00] Saskatchewan there's a whole bunch here
[1:01:02] from Grand Prairie we welcome all those
[1:01:05] from Grand Prairie brother Darren
[1:01:06] brother Stephen your families God bless
[1:01:09] you thank you for coming for
[1:01:11] participating I see many others and as I
[1:01:14] said yesterday if I don't mention you in
[1:01:16] this service don't worry I got two more
[1:01:18] to go I don't know what I'm going to do
[1:01:19] when I get to the last service because
[1:01:21] by then I'll miss somebody but God bless
[1:01:23] you brother weeb God bless you good to
[1:01:25] see everybody that's here we also have
[1:01:28] some Believers here from New York
[1:01:30] we have a couple sisters that came God
[1:01:32] bless you we thank you for coming to our
[1:01:35] meetings and to our little part of the
[1:01:36] world and we have some here also saw I
[1:01:39] think I saw brother Solomon I guess he
[1:01:42] hails from Washington State now but he
[1:01:44] used to be from Edmonton so I'll still
[1:01:46] welcome you as an edmontonian today but
[1:01:48] that's okay so God bless you
[1:01:51] hey man I want to just give you a brief
[1:01:53] announce a few brief announcements about
[1:01:55] the services we started last night and
[1:01:59] for those that you aren't here I don't
[1:02:01] want to just make you feel bad or
[1:02:02] anything but I'll say it's worthwhile to
[1:02:04] go back and listen to that it's not
[1:02:07] robbery
[1:02:08] if I could characterize it this way
[1:02:10] today we had a little gathering over at
[1:02:12] brother Jake and sister Mary's brother
[1:02:14] Ron used to be a stranger but he's at
[1:02:17] home in that house now
[1:02:18] and brother Ron can go in that house and
[1:02:21] he can open the fridge door and he can
[1:02:23] take something out and he can say and
[1:02:26] sit down and do it and I'll tell you
[1:02:27] what it's not robbery
[1:02:29] now somebody else from Russia from from
[1:02:31] Virginia could do that and it would be
[1:02:33] robbery so that's that's just a little
[1:02:36] pre you know they have those little
[1:02:38] Clips before the main thing well that's
[1:02:40] what the service was all about and it
[1:02:42] was a blessing we had brother Nathan
[1:02:44] preach for us and that was not just
[1:02:47] plowing that was more than plowing and
[1:02:50] we we enjoyed that immensely amen
[1:03:00] tonight we're going to have brother Ron
[1:03:02] Spencer speaking for us and he'll be
[1:03:05] coming up and you'll be happy to know
[1:03:07] his luggage arrived
[1:03:09] and uh
[1:03:11] [Applause]
[1:03:15] I don't know if that's good or bad
[1:03:16] because after he had to come up here in
[1:03:19] his jeans tonight I was looking forward
[1:03:21] to wearing jeans and making him feel at
[1:03:23] home but I had to Alas go back to my
[1:03:26] regular attire
[1:03:28] so he'll be speaking tonight he'll be
[1:03:29] also speaking tomorrow night and I'll
[1:03:32] just deal with that shortly but tomorrow
[1:03:34] we've got a full day at 9 30 we've got a
[1:03:37] Minister's meeting and that's for
[1:03:39] ministers and their wife to come and if

[1:04:01] 30 tomorrow afternoon we've got a youth
[1:04:03] meeting here brother Nathan will be
[1:04:05] speaking and I we've always had good
[1:04:09] youth meetings I believe we're going to
[1:04:10] have a wonderful service
[1:04:12] and you know the meetings are good
[1:04:15] when people ask you what's the age limit
[1:04:18] for the youth meeting
[1:04:19] and uh you know it used to be limited to
[1:04:21] single people up to 30 well after much
[1:04:24] discussion we've opened it up to anybody
[1:04:26] that's married in 85. so uh no we're not
[1:04:30] we're not going to do it but the service
[1:04:32] can be streamed so but we'll keep it for
[1:04:35] the Youth but you know they're good
[1:04:36] meetings you know even even the
[1:04:38] ministers meeting there was a brother
[1:04:40] that was asking me says uh can I be
[1:04:42] ordained and attend the meeting and I
[1:04:45] said well I don't know about that

[1:06:25] a few words there as well so if if you

[1:06:30] that was here could come at the time

[1:06:34] going to open that up and we want to
[1:06:36] just honor that and remember that as
[1:06:38] well so
[1:06:40] that that's kind of the events we've got
[1:06:42] some maps at the back I mentioned
[1:06:44] yesterday regarding the parking there's
[1:06:46] parking attendance that will direct you
[1:06:48] on that
[1:06:50] um
[1:06:51] tonight brother Ron is going to minister
[1:06:52] and tomorrow night and
[1:06:55] I just want to say this about brother
[1:06:58] Ron he's he has been here for many years
[1:07:02] and we appreciate you know in God's
[1:07:05] economy God has had there are stars and
[1:07:10] and I don't mean like stars that way but
[1:07:12] in in the in the solar system some shine
[1:07:16] brighter some lesser but they're all
[1:07:19] stars they're all reflecting the light
[1:07:22] of God and God places certain stars at
[1:07:25] certain place the North Star different
[1:07:27] ones brother on has been a blessing to
[1:07:30] many people around the world and his
[1:07:33] gift is not just that of a pastor but
[1:07:36] it's a greater gift there's a gift of
[1:07:38] faith Associated there's a gift of
[1:07:40] healing and so I I want you to recognize
[1:07:45] that it's God in that vessel and in that
[1:07:47] gift
[1:07:48] so he'll speak tonight but then on
[1:07:51] Saturday night we want to make room
[1:07:54] and and we've we've talked on that but
[1:07:57] we want to make room that if you will
[1:07:59] need prayer that we can have a time to
[1:08:01] have prayer
[1:08:02] you know in the in in The Book of Mark
[1:08:06] and let me just take a moment or two to
[1:08:08] say this
[1:08:09] but the commission the Great Commission
[1:08:12] was that these signs would follow them
[1:08:15] that believe
[1:08:16] we would we would go into the gospel
[1:08:18] preach the world those that would
[1:08:20] believe would be and be baptized to be
[1:08:22] saved
[1:08:23] but it would say also in my name they
[1:08:26] shall cast out devils
[1:08:28] and I want to say I believe that Devils
[1:08:30] will be cast out
[1:08:32] tonight tomorrow I believe that the
[1:08:35] kingdom of Satan is going to suffer a
[1:08:37] blow because the Believers are here and
[1:08:40] the angels of God are here
[1:08:42] it says they will also speak with new
[1:08:44] tongues they will take up serpents if
[1:08:47] they drink any deadly thing will not
[1:08:48] hurt them and they will lay hands on the
[1:08:51] sick
[1:08:52] and the sick will recover
[1:08:55] so I believe we need to leave room for
[1:08:57] that we were in a little bit of a Pew
[1:09:00] project we had an extra Pew but we took
[1:09:01] that out
[1:09:03] I felt we needed to have more room at
[1:09:04] the front not just for prayer but for
[1:09:07] people to come to lay their burdens down
[1:09:10] so tomorrow night we're going to just
[1:09:13] leave space for that and if I can just
[1:09:16] give you this short Little Instruction
[1:09:20] I want if you need prayer I want you to
[1:09:22] do as the prophet would say in perfect
[1:09:24] faith
[1:09:25] don't come up unless you have faith for
[1:09:28] that
[1:09:29] don't don't just come up well that's
[1:09:31] brother Ron and whatever will happen no
[1:09:33] why don't you set yourself today
[1:09:35] tomorrow and if you have a need allow
[1:09:39] that need to come into the presence of
[1:09:41] God before you ever come into the prayer
[1:09:44] line
[1:09:45] and then we do that also as you come up
[1:09:49] be recognizing that we're all working
[1:09:51] together this is not brother Ron this is
[1:09:54] God in the body God working through a
[1:09:57] gift and you need to respect that
[1:10:00] there's there's limitations to that gift
[1:10:02] so when you come up you might just
[1:10:04] mention a need don't tell your life
[1:10:06] story
[1:10:07] just say the need let let God come on
[1:10:11] the scene is this all right
[1:10:14] okay I don't want to change the
[1:10:15] atmosphere too much I'm not going to say
[1:10:16] much more but I believe we we need to
[1:10:19] become more mature and say yeah we're
[1:10:21] going to do everything Mark 16 said but
[1:10:24] we're going to do it in a way oh God is
[1:10:26] a mature body with faith in what God
[1:10:29] will do
[1:10:30] let's just stand together
[1:10:33] so we're going to settle our Spirits a
[1:10:35] little bit but let's just sing a song
[1:10:36] Maybe Just let's sing How Great Is Our
[1:10:39] God how
[1:10:42] um the one I wanted sing with me hungry

[1:14:52] up
[1:14:56] I want us just to all sacrifice our
[1:14:58] thoughts
[1:15:00] our beings
[1:15:02] to one cause in this service
[1:15:05] we're out against one enemy
[1:15:09] and we've got a brother here who's given

[1:19:17] has so been saturated by the presence of
[1:19:19] the Lord

[1:24:13] was thinking of this meeting
[1:24:17] and it was a burden like I had a weight

[1:24:23] sister Connie took me to Cracker Barrel
[1:24:26] it's American institution you ought to

[1:26:10] and strength
[1:26:12] a very present help and trouble
[1:26:16] therefore will not we fear though the
[1:26:19] Earth be removed and though the
[1:26:21] mountains be carried into the midst of
[1:26:22] the sea
[1:26:23] though the waters thereof Roar and the
[1:26:26] be troubled though the mountains shake
[1:26:29] with the swelling thereofs Allah
[1:26:31] there is a river in the streams whereof

[1:27:34] amen you can be seated
[1:27:40] Jeremiah
[1:27:41] chapter 17 and verse 14.
[1:27:44] Heal Me O Lord and I shall be healed
[1:27:47] save me and I shall be saved
[1:27:50] for thou art my praise
[1:27:53] Psalm 6 and verse 2 have mercy upon Me O
[1:27:57] Lord for I am weak O Lord Heal me for my
[1:28:01] bones are vexed
[1:28:03] Psalms 12 and verse 4 who have said with
[1:28:07] our tongue
[1:28:09] will we Prevail our lips are our own who
[1:28:14] is Lord over
[1:28:17] Isaiah 54 and verse 17 no weapon
[1:28:22] [Applause]
[1:28:26] Hallelujah no weapon that is formed
[1:28:30] against thee
[1:28:32] shall prosper
[1:28:34] and every tongue that shall rise against
[1:28:37] thee
[1:28:39] in judgment Thou shalt condemn
[1:28:45] this is not only a prophetic and promise
[1:28:48] of the scripture
[1:28:50] for the most powerful people on the
[1:28:52] Earth but this is also an action
[1:28:55] scripture
[1:28:56] so I would like for Satan to listen
[1:29:02] he's here
[1:29:05] he's here you'll have to cast him out
[1:29:08] no weapon
[1:29:12] that is formed against thee shall
[1:29:14] prosper
[1:29:16] and every tongue that shall rise against
[1:29:19] them the Judgment Thou shalt condemn
[1:29:24] this is the heritage of the Servants of
[1:29:26] the Lord and their righteousness of me
[1:29:30] notice these next words saith the Lord
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:35] we know God is a God that's never lied
[1:29:39] he's a God that's never failed
[1:29:43] we could pray a prayer like this
[1:29:46] Lord Jesus you are the name above every
[1:29:49] name
[1:29:52] your name is like a fortified Tower in
[1:29:54] which I can find Safety and Security
[1:29:58] when I'm troubled I can find peace in
[1:30:01] your name
[1:30:01] when I am weak when I feel weak I can
[1:30:05] found strength in your name
[1:30:07] when I'm overwhelmed I can find rest in
[1:30:10] your name
[1:30:11] when I feel surrounded by the pressures
[1:30:13] on every side I can find stability in
[1:30:17] your name
[1:30:18] you're never present help in the time of
[1:30:20] troubles
[1:30:22] when it seemed like the world is
[1:30:24] crumbling around me I am thrown
[1:30:27] around by the storms of my life take
[1:30:31] away my fear when I am weak
[1:30:34] You Are My Strength when I am vulnerable
[1:30:36] you are my refuge when I cry for help
[1:30:40] you will answer me
[1:30:42] you are the Prince of Peace
[1:30:46] you are the Lord of lords
[1:30:49] you are the king of kings
[1:30:55] I want you to remind mind you today that
[1:30:57] this is a Jesus meeting
[1:31:02] this is a Jesus meeting
[1:31:06] now in a Jesus meeting maybe you've come
[1:31:08] and
[1:31:10] and you know maybe there's someone
[1:31:12] that's a sinner or someone that's got a
[1:31:14] lot of difficulties in their life and
[1:31:17] maybe the law of the scripture says that
[1:31:19] they shouldn't be among the sir
[1:31:22] maybe this one's done that to hurt you
[1:31:25] or this one's had this little
[1:31:27] acts against one another and you know
[1:31:29] and a lot of times Satan gets in the
[1:31:32] details of a lot of things and
[1:31:34] he'll begin to work because he knows he
[1:31:36] can't defeat the word
[1:31:39] as a matter of fact he can't even get to
[1:31:41] your soul but he afflicts your flesh and
[1:31:44] he afflicts your spirit and you can get
[1:31:46] in a spirit to where that it can take
[1:31:49] you in a lot of different directions and
[1:31:51] it'll cause you to be critical with one
[1:31:53] another it'll cause you to be sharp with
[1:31:55] one another brother Ed hadn't told me
[1:31:57] anything so I I just feel free
[1:32:00] I'm a pastor too
[1:32:02] and so it'll cost us Humanity
[1:32:06] it'll cause our Humanity to look across
[1:32:09] the Pew and maybe have a dart
[1:32:11] but in Jesus's meetings you find a place
[1:32:14] to where you can drop your rocks
[1:32:22] see sometimes we come to church
[1:32:25] even in a convention and we're looking
[1:32:27] over here and we're looking over here
[1:32:29] and we're looking over there and we're
[1:32:30] looking over there and and if we're not
[1:32:32] careful we'll get in an accusing or a
[1:32:35] atmosphere of who's here and who's not
[1:32:38] here and
[1:32:40] we have a whole pocket full of rocks
[1:32:44] but but when they brought a woman before
[1:32:48] Jesus to accuse her
[1:32:51] and and they had a right and the law
[1:32:53] said that they could
[1:32:55] and there was a lot of things that that
[1:32:58] was at trial here today
[1:33:00] what would Jesus do with his own word
[1:33:04] and Jesus knew their atmosphere
[1:33:08] he knew the real reason behind the
[1:33:10] reason
[1:33:12] now he wasn't going to change his word
[1:33:15] so he just simply stooped down and
[1:33:17] preached
[1:33:20] [Applause]
[1:33:22] you know in some of these most powerful
[1:33:25] moments he was quiet
[1:33:30] he was quiet before Pilate
[1:33:34] with a screaming mob his silence was
[1:33:37] deafening
[1:33:39] and Jesus asked these men that are
[1:33:42] accusing this woman and they have they
[1:33:45] have stones to do the job and Jesus says
[1:33:50] he that is without sin
[1:33:53] amen
[1:33:56] now he is without sin
[1:33:59] cast the first stone
[1:34:03] I think that's one thing that brother
[1:34:05] Branham was so successful at coming from
[1:34:08] a family of bootleggers
[1:34:11] he always remembered it he was the most
[1:34:15] important one in the room
[1:34:21] we can remember where we came from
[1:34:28] and Satan tried to destroy us in our
[1:34:31] potential form
[1:34:33] he would have did everything against us
[1:34:36] then to try to destroy us because he
[1:34:38] could see a light following you
[1:34:40] even while you were a sinner
[1:34:45] he could look in that realm and see that
[1:34:48] light that was following you that angel
[1:34:51] that was protecting you
[1:34:54] when you was unworthy when you were an
[1:34:57] alien from the kingdom of God when you
[1:34:59] was a nobody
[1:35:01] not a church wanted you but Jesus had a
[1:35:05] plan in your life
[1:35:07] [Applause]
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:10] and no doubt Your Vessel was being used
[1:35:12] to do a lot of things but one day God
[1:35:15] would empty that vessel and fill it with
[1:35:18] the spirit of God and then shake the
[1:35:21] kingdom of hell with that
[1:35:25] now I want to ask you a woman
[1:35:27] where is thy accuser
[1:35:32] Give the Lord a good hand
[1:35:42] he is the name above every name
[1:35:47] he is far above every principality and
[1:35:50] Power
[1:35:51] his Dominion
[1:35:53] not only is in this world but in the
[1:35:56] world to come
[1:35:58] there has never been one greater than
[1:36:01] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:36:03] it is the highest of all names
[1:36:08] God has gathered you to represent him on
[1:36:12] the Earth
[1:36:14] of all the people down through the ages
[1:36:17] of time he has saved you to this day
[1:36:21] knowing that this would be Satan's Eden
[1:36:24] where every demon of hell would be
[1:36:26] loosed against you
[1:36:29] hear the words Invincible Army super
[1:36:32] race super Church Barnaby's bone life of
[1:36:35] his life those were not casual words
[1:36:39] [Applause]
[1:36:41] but that was not just the words of our
[1:36:44] Prophet but that was the words of God
[1:36:47] about you
[1:36:48] [Applause]
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:36:52] [Applause]
[1:36:54] now if you can believe it
[1:36:57] you heard it last night
[1:37:00] but it's now more than just believing it
[1:37:02] but now it's got to take action
[1:37:04] [Applause]
[1:37:07] now remember
[1:37:09] Brandon said now God just doesn't make a
[1:37:12] tree
[1:37:13] just to see if he can do it
[1:37:18] he just doesn't make this to see if he
[1:37:20] can do it he just doesn't do that to see
[1:37:23] if he can do it he just didn't watch
[1:37:26] over you since the days of Adam
[1:37:32] this one Mary and that one and this one
[1:37:34] Mary and that one and this one Mary and
[1:37:36] that one all the way down even when
[1:37:38] Jesus was here you're you're your seed
[1:37:41] was on the Earth
[1:37:43] and God watched over your seed in that
[1:37:45] natural form
[1:37:49] Wars and pestilence and and moving from
[1:37:52] country to Country and watching over you
[1:37:55] God was watching over your seat
[1:37:58] now you may be the only one in that
[1:38:01] natural lineage that ever has become a
[1:38:03] Christian
[1:38:05] [Applause]
[1:38:08] you may have had a lot of
[1:38:11] history of evil in your family
[1:38:15] but God rich in Mercy
[1:38:17] [Applause]
[1:38:19] God rich and mercy watched over you
[1:38:24] because before the foundational world
[1:38:27] before there was ever a molecule of this
[1:38:31] Earth displayed he saw you
[1:38:38] he knew Adam would fall
[1:38:41] and because you were in the book
[1:38:44] and because he had created his own enemy
[1:38:49] he knew that we would have forces
[1:38:52] against us so he came himself
[1:38:55] [Applause]
[1:38:57] he just didn't send an angel he came
[1:39:00] himself
[1:39:03] [Applause]
[1:39:04] to provide everything that you would
[1:39:06] have made of to overcome in this day
[1:39:11] [Applause]
[1:39:16] now he did that more than just to see if
[1:39:18] he could do it
[1:39:20] he's not playing a game here of Chess
[1:39:22] checkers
[1:39:25] hockey
[1:39:27] trying to find you
[1:39:30] he does just he's not just not Gathering
[1:39:33] a church
[1:39:35] he's not Gathering a click
[1:39:38] it's not Gathering families
[1:39:41] he's Gathering a wife
[1:39:43] [Applause]
[1:39:46] [Music]
[1:39:47] a wife that he can place his seed in
[1:39:50] [Applause]
[1:39:52] and he's going to give you a word so
[1:39:54] powerful in this day
[1:39:56] it'll not be the mind of a man
[1:39:59] it'll not denominate
[1:40:01] it will not deteriorate
[1:40:04] [Applause]
[1:40:05] and everything Satan will do to try to
[1:40:08] destroy the message will only elevate it
[1:40:10] to show us that it's a masterpiece
[1:40:15] and the people that will eat the book
[1:40:17] and realize that the book is open to
[1:40:19] them and they realize that they're the
[1:40:22] Ruth of this day
[1:40:24] [Applause]
[1:40:27] I love that
[1:40:29] [Applause]
[1:40:31] if I I can't add anything to that
[1:40:34] but let me just say this you
[1:40:36] look at your past
[1:40:41] so I want to destroy that work right now
[1:40:44] God doesn't look at your past
[1:40:47] like you look at your past
[1:40:52] if you're if you're in the Rahab lineage
[1:40:57] when Rahab Mary salmon
[1:41:01] and him being a great a great warrior
[1:41:05] and a great captain
[1:41:07] I will guarantee you one thing for sure
[1:41:10] he never reminded her of where she came
[1:41:13] from
[1:41:14] [Applause]
[1:41:16] once she became his wife
[1:41:19] he never called her a harlot
[1:41:22] [Applause]
[1:41:29] Boaz never reminded Ruth
[1:41:32] [Applause]
[1:41:34] of her start passed and the things that
[1:41:38] she had been under and the oppression I
[1:41:40] will guarantee you everybody that worked
[1:41:42] around Boaz
[1:41:45] dare not say anything about her
[1:41:48] because she was his wife
[1:41:50] [Applause]
[1:41:54] can I take it to a higher level the
[1:41:57] enemy that is in trouble
[1:41:59] [Applause]
[1:42:01] when he torments you and afflicts you
[1:42:04] and it condemns you and he is our
[1:42:08] husband
[1:42:09] [Applause]
[1:42:12] that enemy will be judged for the things
[1:42:16] that he has said about you
[1:42:20] because God don't look at you that way
[1:42:23] anymore
[1:42:25] [Applause]
[1:42:40] Psalms 22.
[1:42:44] Jesus was in the Tomb
[1:42:47] he was conquering death hell in the
[1:42:49] grave
[1:42:52] to the visible light you couldn't see
[1:42:54] what was going on but in another realm
[1:42:56] he was conquering hell
[1:42:58] [Applause]
[1:43:00] he was conquering death
[1:43:03] so you and I wouldn't have to go there
[1:43:06] God sent him to hell
[1:43:09] so you and I would not have to go
[1:43:14] but Psalms 22 said I will not suffer my
[1:43:17] Holy One to seek corruption
[1:43:20] [Applause]
[1:43:23] so in that body
[1:43:26] corruption could not set into it
[1:43:30] and you're the reason
[1:43:33] [Music]
[1:43:34] you're the reason you were in him
[1:43:37] [Applause]
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:41] now if I can just say this bully if he
[1:43:43] couldn't corrupt you 2 000 years ago
[1:43:47] he can't corrupt you now
[1:43:55] Hallelujah
[1:43:56] [Music]
[1:43:58] thank you
[1:43:59] man
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:04] can I say this to you oh what a blood
[1:44:10] oh what a blood
[1:44:20] well that's a good starting point in
[1:44:21] there
[1:44:23] it feels like it's 10 000 volts of
[1:44:25] electricity up here
[1:44:30] now Christ was man
[1:44:33] of devil and brother Branham says you
[1:44:35] believe that
[1:44:37] now I can't explain all of this I I'm
[1:44:40] just going to go through and just
[1:44:42] quickly now hit the high place
[1:44:44] sir you won't have to stay too long
[1:44:47] Christ was manifested to destroy the
[1:44:50] works of the devil ask them is that
[1:44:52] right
[1:44:53] you believe that that's why he was what
[1:44:57] he was God's word which destroys the
[1:45:01] works of the hybrid the devil is that
[1:45:05] right
[1:45:07] he was done to do that
[1:45:09] he was born to be that
[1:45:12] to destroy
[1:45:16] The Works of the devil
[1:45:19] now his body is to do the same thing
[1:45:25] [Applause]
[1:45:28] now his body is to do the same thing
[1:45:33] because the body is the head and the
[1:45:36] body is together that's right and if
[1:45:38] Christ is the head what's the word his
[1:45:41] body has to be the same thing as the
[1:45:44] head was
[1:45:46] that's right a church of the word
[1:45:49] born of the word virgin born from the
[1:45:53] word not denomination
[1:45:56] now virgin born from the word the way
[1:46:01] the body operates is by the heck
[1:46:05] [Applause]
[1:46:10] who is that brother Ron look around
[1:46:17] Satan could not take them
[1:46:20] he could not drown Noah in the flood
[1:46:23] until the purpose of God had been
[1:46:25] finished
[1:46:26] he could not burn up Hebrew children
[1:46:30] until the purpose of God has been
[1:46:32] finished
[1:46:33] he could not kill job with balls and
[1:46:36] troubles until the purpose of God has
[1:46:38] been finished
[1:46:39] neither could the lions eat Daniel and
[1:46:42] to the purpose of God has been finished
[1:46:44] neither could death an old age take
[1:46:47] Abraham until the purpose of God has
[1:46:49] been finished and neither can it take
[1:46:52] you
[1:46:56] or take me
[1:46:57] until the purpose of God of our life is
[1:47:01] finished
[1:47:02] [Applause]
[1:47:07] Hallelujah
[1:47:09] I stand here with zero fear
[1:47:13] zero fear of where I'm standing in life
[1:47:18] answer could have took my life it would
[1:47:20] have taken my life
[1:47:21] [Applause]
[1:47:23] but it's going to take a stronger when
[1:47:25] than this
[1:47:32] why does God let troubles come God
[1:47:35] harnesses troubles and put its in the
[1:47:37] mouth and makes it obey him
[1:47:40] those troubles
[1:47:42] bring us closer to Fellowship
[1:47:46] with God
[1:47:49] well brother Ron I just feel like I've
[1:47:51] been a war in my life in the last few
[1:47:52] weeks it just feels like all Satan's
[1:47:54] against me well I've got some scripture
[1:47:57] for you in Revelations chapter 12 and
[1:48:00] verse 7 and there was war in heaven
[1:48:05] and Michael and his angels fought
[1:48:06] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[1:48:08] in his angels
[1:48:10] and Prevail not I love that Prevail not
[1:48:14] neither was any place found any more in
[1:48:16] heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out
[1:48:19] now do you remember that Satan
[1:48:22] if you're still here do you remember
[1:48:24] that
[1:48:28] that old serpent
[1:48:31] called the devil and Satan which
[1:48:33] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[1:48:35] out into the Earth and his angels were
[1:48:37] cast out with him and I heard a loud
[1:48:39] voice saying in heaven now has come
[1:48:42] salvation and strength in the Kingdom of
[1:48:44] our God and the and the power of His
[1:48:46] Christ for the accuser I Brethren is
[1:48:50] cast down
[1:48:52] which accused them before our God day
[1:48:55] and night notice now what we're going to
[1:48:57] do and they overcame him
[1:48:59] [Applause]
[1:49:03] by the blood of the Lamb
[1:49:05] and the word of their testimony
[1:49:08] [Applause]
[1:49:12] I want to read that again and they
[1:49:14] overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
[1:49:18] let's just say it together and they
[1:49:20] overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
[1:49:23] and by the word of their testimony
[1:49:37] brother on but that was written two
[1:49:39] thousand years ago yep and it's
[1:49:41] applicable for you today
[1:49:42] [Applause]
[1:49:46] now we're going to change this just a
[1:49:47] moment and they overcame him by the
[1:49:49] blood of the Lamb
[1:49:51] say it with me and they overcame it by
[1:49:54] the blood of the Lamb
[1:49:56] and the word
[1:49:58] of my testimony
[1:50:07] every one of you are different
[1:50:14] this isn't a cookie cutter message
[1:50:18] everybody want me like you or not nor
[1:50:21] wants to be like you
[1:50:28] [Laughter]
[1:50:31] Hallelujah
[1:50:34] brother Lonnie Jenkins said I always do
[1:50:36] heart surgery
[1:50:38] he said brother Ron does heart surgery
[1:50:41] and smiles while he's cutting your heart
[1:50:43] out
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:50:48] but every one of you has a book
[1:50:52] and it's got a lot of chapters in it
[1:50:56] and there's places where there's blank
[1:50:58] pages
[1:51:00] and I have a lot of words in it
[1:51:03] but the blood took care of that
[1:51:07] and now the accuser can't find it even
[1:51:09] to bring it up to God
[1:51:14] [Applause]
[1:51:19] Satan hasn't got any legal rights at all
[1:51:22] over a Christian
[1:51:26] every time a man gets saved God just
[1:51:30] writes a whole big bunch of checks like
[1:51:32] that
[1:51:33] and puts his name at the bottom and said
[1:51:35] here they are fill them out
[1:51:38] are you scared of it fill it out
[1:51:41] whatever things that you desire When you
[1:51:44] pray
[1:51:44] [Applause]
[1:51:46] a lot of unanswered prayers is unprayed
[1:51:50] prayers
[1:51:51] [Applause]
[1:51:55] and if Satan can get you too busy to
[1:51:58] pray
[1:52:00] he knows he can't defeat you with the
[1:52:02] word but just get you busy
[1:52:05] just get you pointing at one another
[1:52:08] but if you remember what you've been
[1:52:10] called for
[1:52:11] [Applause]
[1:52:13] now now let me just say this you he
[1:52:15] knows that you as a Believer has every
[1:52:19] legal right
[1:52:22] to cast him out
[1:52:30] but I'm a woman yep
[1:52:32] you guys preached greater sermons a lot
[1:52:34] of times than men do
[1:52:37] oh don't get quiet on me now it's not a
[1:52:39] good time
[1:52:41] we are all commissioned to cast out
[1:52:43] Satan
[1:52:44] [Applause]
[1:52:48] Jesus knew the prayer power of Prayer
[1:52:52] he knew with this connection with God
[1:52:54] and the angels would would stand at his
[1:52:56] command
[1:52:58] let me just say this to you you are
[1:53:00] fortified greater
[1:53:04] than the president of the United States
[1:53:06] of America or your primary
[1:53:11] and listen Our God's not a politician
[1:53:15] I'm ever amazed that people will gather
[1:53:17] 80 000 people to gather to hear a bunch
[1:53:19] of Lies
[1:53:22] and they don't want to go to church to
[1:53:24] hear a preacher tell exactly what the
[1:53:26] truth is
[1:53:29] but our job is to destroy the works of
[1:53:33] the devil
[1:53:35] and we have the authority like brother
[1:53:37] Branham said that little police officer
[1:53:39] said he doesn't have the power to stop a
[1:53:42] bicycle but he walks out there and puts
[1:53:45] his hand up in that badge on his chest
[1:53:47] and blows his whistle he said break
[1:53:50] start screeching
[1:53:52] let me remind you are you an ambassador
[1:53:55] of God
[1:53:56] [Applause]
[1:54:00] Hallelujah you're an ambassador of God
[1:54:03] oh my brother Ron if those Saints of the
[1:54:05] ages would come back in this day but God
[1:54:08] selected you
[1:54:09] [Applause]
[1:54:13] he selected Jew to live in this day
[1:54:17] and he does not have expectations of you
[1:54:20] failing
[1:54:21] [Applause]
[1:54:30] so you're here for a purpose
[1:54:34] you're here to destroy the works of the
[1:54:37] devil
[1:54:39] and you have a
[1:54:41] Jesus came to destroy the works of the
[1:54:44] devil
[1:54:45] then you're his offsprings and you'll
[1:54:47] destroy the works of the devil
[1:54:49] sons and daughters have the same
[1:54:51] ambition of our father
[1:54:55] so my declaration to you let's start
[1:54:59] destroying
[1:55:00] [Applause]
[1:55:07] Psalms chapter 91 and verse 1 for those
[1:55:10] that have known me for a long time know
[1:55:11] that this is my favorite scriptures he
[1:55:14] that dwelleth in the secret place of the
[1:55:16] most high shall abide Under The Shadow
[1:55:19] of the Almighty
[1:55:21] and I will say of the Lord he is my
[1:55:23] refuge and my Fortress my God in him
[1:55:25] will I trust
[1:55:27] surely he shall deliver thee From The
[1:55:29] Snare of the Fowler and from the noise
[1:55:30] on pestilence
[1:55:32] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[1:55:34] and under his wings Thou shalt trust his
[1:55:37] truth shall be thy shield and buckler
[1:55:39] Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[1:55:42] thy night nor the arrow that flies by
[1:55:43] day nor the pestilence that walketh in
[1:55:46] darkness nor the destruction that
[1:55:48] wasteth at noon day A thousand shall
[1:55:51] fall at thy sight and ten thousand at
[1:55:53] thy right hand but it shall not come
[1:55:55] nigh thee Only With Thine Eyes shall
[1:55:57] thou behold and see the reward of the
[1:55:59] wicked because thou Hast made the Lord
[1:56:02] which is my refuge even the most high
[1:56:05] thy habitation
[1:56:08] there shall no evil befall thee neither
[1:56:11] shall any plague come Thy Thy dwelling
[1:56:13] for he shall give his angels charge over
[1:56:16] thee
[1:56:22] [Music]
[1:56:23] to keep thee
[1:56:26] in all the ways
[1:56:30] [Applause]
[1:56:36] now demons know that you have the
[1:56:39] authority
[1:56:40] [Music]
[1:56:42] they know that you have the authority
[1:56:45] they just hope you don't know
[1:56:47] [Music]
[1:56:48] [Applause]
[1:56:50] demons know that you have the authority
[1:56:53] they hope you don't know
[1:57:03] Angelo Dundee probably
[1:57:06] was the greatest Corner man for any
[1:57:08] boxer
[1:57:11] one of the most famous boxers that ever
[1:57:13] lived in the Earth
[1:57:16] and I'll share a story with you after I
[1:57:17] tell you this
[1:57:19] was Muhammad Ali
[1:57:22] you made a great statement one time he
[1:57:24] said I didn't have to tell Muhammad Ali
[1:57:28] how to fight
[1:57:30] I just had to remind him of who he was
[1:57:40] [Music]
[1:57:42] Ron but that's a boxing story well let
[1:57:44] me just give you a little brief history
[1:57:46] here that probably a lot of you don't
[1:57:48] know
[1:57:49] I walked out of my hotel room as a young
[1:57:51] preacher
[1:57:53] and it was a man standing and he had his
[1:57:55] foot on the rail Second Story and had
[1:57:58] his foot on the rail and he was standing
[1:58:00] there and he was the preacher of the
[1:58:02] evening services at this large camp
[1:58:04] meeting
[1:58:06] I recognized who he was and I just began
[1:58:09] to talk to him and he turned around to
[1:58:11] me and he said do you like boxing
[1:58:16] His Name Was Harold Hildebrand
[1:58:20] he said I like boxing
[1:58:23] he said I really like he said I really
[1:58:25] like the fight

[1:58:33] cause I lack a good fight
[1:58:37] now don't you go get holier than thou
[1:58:45] cause we're in a real fight
[1:58:49] when these eyelids open up in the
[1:58:51] morning
[1:58:52] and they said I should have died three
[1:58:54] years ago
[1:58:57] and I realized I haven't fulfilled God's
[1:59:00] purpose yet
[1:59:03] I'm not promised tomorrow so let me just
[1:59:05] say this you hell
[1:59:08] is in trouble
[1:59:11] as long as I got breath in my lungs I'm
[1:59:14] gonna praise the Lord
[1:59:23] and I'm not going to stand in front of a
[1:59:25] people that's a bride of Jesus Christ
[1:59:27] that is the most powerful people that
[1:59:29] there is on the Earth
[1:59:31] and give them some little poetry just to
[1:59:33] kind of get them to the next service I
[1:59:36] want to remind you

[2:00:11] he increases their strength
[2:00:14] even to you shall feign and be wearing
[2:00:16] the young men shall utterly fall fall
[2:00:19] but they that wait upon the Lord
[2:00:23] shall renew their strength
[2:00:26] they shall Mount up with wings as an
[2:00:28] eagle they shall run and not be weary
[2:00:31] they shall walk in nothing
[2:00:34] [Applause]
[2:00:38] First Corinthians chapter 15 and verse
[2:00:40] 58 therefore my beloved brethren

[2:04:42] forgot who you're fooling with

[2:04:52] enemy

[2:04:56] incredible boasts
[2:04:58] and God will send him a boy
[2:05:03] [Applause]
[2:05:10] create a chamber where it gets so hot
[2:05:12] and tell even the men that will throw in
[2:05:14] three Hebrew children
[2:05:17] they will be consumed by the fire
[2:05:21] but God has provided a conference
[2:05:26] and our Prophet would go and look in
[2:05:28] that Dimension and say wormwood would go
[2:05:31] before God and said let me go down there
[2:05:33] and change it I flooded the world
[2:05:36] I can put the fire out
[2:05:39] others will come and say let me go down

[2:07:10] [Applause]
[2:07:12] they're very temporary
[2:07:14] brother Ron but you just don't know what
[2:07:16] the doctors told me I got a good idea

[2:07:24] but before my storm

[2:07:32] weeks before the storm would start
[2:07:35] if you'll trust me
[2:07:37] I'll use you late never before
[2:07:47] and people from around the world

[2:07:56] maybe we're no other preacher has ever
[2:07:58] stood
[2:08:00] lung cancer brain cancer chemo every day
[2:08:04] no hope by the doctors
[2:08:06] even told the other day that I'm on a
[2:08:09] terminal that you know it you know
[2:08:11] they'll only go so far but I got another
[2:08:13] doctor
[2:08:19] I got another doctor I have another
[2:08:22] report
[2:08:24] I choose to report readable reports
[2:08:28] that says I'm Healed
[2:08:35] so young people when you're going
[2:08:36] through a trial you may never remember
[2:08:39] my name but you can remember my story

[2:08:45] are you with me the same God is your god
[2:08:49] my God your God he's no respecter of
[2:08:52] persons
[2:08:55] you may feel like an orphan child you
[2:08:57] may feel so alone you can't stand
[2:08:59] yourself seems like you're the only one
[2:09:01] in the world and the devil is Whispering
[2:09:04] everything you can in your ear Every
[2:09:06] dart of hell is against you but let me
[2:09:09] just say the god that's with you is
[2:09:12] greater than ever God
[2:09:16] every devil that fights a good shoe
[2:09:20] [Applause]
[2:09:29] none of us have ever had a day like job
[2:09:31] had
[2:09:34] none of us
[2:09:38] The Book of Job is an Incredible Book
[2:09:42] it shows us what Humanity can go through
[2:09:48] but a prophet
[2:09:50] would take us even before job
[2:09:54] and
[2:09:57] they begin to explain that
[2:10:01] that the enemy
[2:10:03] came before God and God asked him said
[2:10:06] where you been
[2:10:09] where you been
[2:10:11] well I've been searching to and fro
[2:10:14] in the earth seeking whom I may devour
[2:10:17] Satan has an ambition
[2:10:19] to destroy you
[2:10:23] he would destroy you with a lot of
[2:10:25] different things and he offers you guys
[2:10:26] a whole lot of different things he'll
[2:10:28] offer your jobs he'll offer your
[2:10:29] relationships you'll offer you a lot of
[2:10:31] prosperity
[2:10:34] but it's only temporary
[2:10:37] I've been going to and fro in the earth
[2:10:39] seeking whom I may devour and God speaks
[2:10:42] up and said have you considered my
[2:10:44] servant job
[2:10:46] now brother Branham said the reason he
[2:10:48] would say that's because he'd been
[2:10:49] fellowshipping with him
[2:10:52] he fellowship with Abraham and he's
[2:10:54] fellowship with you
[2:10:56] and you've had some trials I've had some
[2:10:58] trials
[2:11:00] now we don't have trust in your flesh
[2:11:03] but he has trust in that seed
[2:11:05] [Applause]
[2:11:08] your flesh will get the urge to quit
[2:11:12] your flesh will say I've had enough
[2:11:15] your flesh will begin to talk the
[2:11:17] devil's language your flesh will take on
[2:11:20] spirits
[2:11:24] but God had confidence in the sea
[2:11:34] and trial after trial after trial that
[2:11:36] none of us has said trials like him
[2:11:49] children
[2:11:50] wealth animals
[2:11:55] gone
[2:11:58] horrific stories
[2:12:02] in a short manner of time he did not get
[2:12:04] a letter from heaven saying you're about
[2:12:06] to go through this
[2:12:13] he didn't know when God would show up
[2:12:16] it just kept going
[2:12:20] but the only thing he knew to trust was
[2:12:22] God
[2:12:27] a lot of things even an Unwritten in the
[2:12:29] Book of Job that you've heard
[2:12:31] in your ears
[2:12:36] but when God comes to visit him
[2:12:41] when it comes down to visit him God
[2:12:43] doesn't talk about any of his trials
[2:12:52] he doesn't talk about any of his trials
[2:12:55] he doesn't talk about how bad is God and
[2:12:58] how much loss he's had
[2:13:01] he doesn't talk about how defeated he
[2:13:03] feels
[2:13:05] he begins to talk about the Eternal
[2:13:07] Realm
[2:13:08] [Applause]
[2:13:15] he begins to remind him job where was
[2:13:18] you
[2:13:22] can I call your name right here where
[2:13:24] was you
[2:13:25] when I laid the foundations of the Earth
[2:13:28] when I put the Zodiac the first Bible
[2:13:30] into place you represent one of them
[2:13:33] Stars
[2:13:34] [Applause]
[2:13:38] Abraham can you count the Sun to the Sea
[2:13:42] no you can't count them that's your
[2:13:44] natural seed can you count the stars of
[2:13:46] the heaven
[2:13:47] no way well that's why spiritual seed
[2:13:52] and Abraham was standing there trial us
[2:13:55] God's not looking at your circumstances
[2:13:58] now
[2:14:00] or help me preach
[2:14:02] he's not looking at how you feel he's
[2:14:06] not looking at your critical spirit he's
[2:14:08] not looking at all the things that
[2:14:10] you're fighting in your life
[2:14:13] where was you
[2:14:18] when I pre-planned you where was you
[2:14:20] when I built you when I was you when I
[2:14:23] put my attributes inside of you
[2:14:29] where was she when I laid your put your
[2:14:32] name in the book
[2:14:34] I'll not lose a one
[2:14:41] I'll not lose someone
[2:14:46] foreign
[2:14:50] but I don't know how much longer I'm
[2:14:52] holding I can hold on you're not the one
[2:14:55] holding on
[2:15:01] go ahead Shout
[2:15:03] I thank God I'm not the one holding on
[2:15:06] I'd have quit a long time ago I didn't
[2:15:09] give up a long time ago I was
[2:15:11] discouraged a long time ago
[2:15:14] [Music]
[2:15:16] [Applause]
[2:15:19] I'm not holding on please
[2:15:23] holding on to me
[2:15:25] [Applause]
[2:15:26] [Music]
[2:15:27] [Applause]
[2:15:45] look past your backslidden condition
[2:15:48] look past your place to where you feel
[2:15:51] so depressed you can't go on look past
[2:15:54] that circumstances that are around you
[2:15:56] look past your troubles
[2:15:59] look past the things that you can't see
[2:16:02] through tomorrow
[2:16:02] [Applause]
[2:16:09] [Music]
[2:16:14] I called you
[2:16:16] I Justified you
[2:16:18] [Applause]
[2:16:21] I have glorified you
[2:16:31] no wonder our Prophet could stand here
[2:16:33] and preach to people that didn't believe
[2:16:35] it
[2:16:36] because he'd seen an eternal Realm
[2:16:38] [Applause]
[2:16:38] [Music]
[2:16:40] [Applause]
[2:16:43] because a lot of preachers would turn
[2:16:45] against him
[2:16:46] and he knew
[2:16:48] in his own flesh he said
[2:16:50] I haven't done anything for God
[2:16:53] his hands behind his head
[2:16:57] an enemy was talking
[2:17:00] would you like to look beyond the
[2:17:02] curtain of time
[2:17:03] [Applause]
[2:17:04] [Music]
[2:17:07] he needed to see more than rejection of
[2:17:09] humanity
[2:17:10] [Applause]
[2:17:13] he needed to see more than a
[2:17:15] Bootlegger's son
[2:17:16] [Applause]
[2:17:17] he needed to see more than a lost wife
[2:17:21] and a lost daughter
[2:17:23] he needed to see more than just a little
[2:17:25] bitty Church
[2:17:27] he needed to see more than coming to
[2:17:29] Saskatoon in Edmonton and church is
[2:17:32] turning against him
[2:17:34] he needed to see into another Realm
[2:17:37] [Music]
[2:17:38] he needed to handle them
[2:17:43] [Music]
[2:17:45] Not Just an Illusion
[2:17:48] but he needed to handle them
[2:17:52] amen
[2:17:54] that regardless of tax cases
[2:17:58] people worshiping him as God
[2:18:01] his human frailties
[2:18:04] pulling off his shirt and Mowing and
[2:18:06] people coming by and feeling condemned
[2:18:09] God needed to show him an eternal Realm
[2:18:14] what are these Services about
[2:18:17] we're not going to be here much longer
[2:18:21] there's another Realm
[2:18:24] [Applause]
[2:18:25] yes God has plans
[2:18:29] [Music]
[2:18:29] [Applause]
[2:18:31] now you remember when
[2:18:34] I won't be much longer now
[2:18:37] you remember when God was coming
[2:18:40] and blew himself a body
[2:18:43] picked up some elements of the Earth and
[2:18:46] and then he stepped in
[2:18:49] because Abraham was now approaching the
[2:18:54] impossible age
[2:18:55] [Music]
[2:18:57] let me let me just talk to you about it
[2:18:59] God will allow things in your life to
[2:19:02] let you know that you can't do it on
[2:19:05] your own
[2:19:06] [Applause]
[2:19:16] now he knew
[2:19:18] Abraham's going to have a son through
[2:19:19] Sarah
[2:19:22] but I need to wait to where it's a total
[2:19:25] impossibility
[2:19:27] for him to be able to say that I did it
[2:19:34] [Applause]
[2:19:36] [Music]
[2:19:36] [Applause]
[2:19:39] and he had to wait till Sarah became a
[2:19:41] cranky
[2:19:46] or woman
[2:19:52] that was tired of hearing the story
[2:19:57] so he knew I got to go have a
[2:20:00] conversation with her
[2:20:09] now that morning
[2:20:12] that morning Sarah was in the tent
[2:20:17] and she was fussing
[2:20:23] you said brother Ron you're out on a
[2:20:24] limb no I'm I'm in the message
[2:20:26] [Applause]
[2:20:28] and it said she was fussing about you
[2:20:31] know those Caravans
[2:20:33] they don't come by here they go down to
[2:20:36] where lot's wife's at
[2:20:37] she gets the nicest clothes and she gets
[2:20:40] the nicest hats and she gets all the
[2:20:43] nicest things and she was just in a
[2:20:45] fussy Stewie
[2:20:52] kind of happens at church sometimes
[2:20:57] and Jesus is on his way
[2:21:00] you know a good sign of a meetings when
[2:21:02] people get fussy and Stewie
[2:21:10] ah you don't have to hide now
[2:21:15] I know I'm so On Target it's
[2:21:16] unbelievable
[2:21:19] there's pastors all across this building
[2:21:22] you know what I'm talking about
[2:21:26] some of your most faithful right-hand
[2:21:28] people take a knife put it up under your
[2:21:30] chest and wiggle it around and you've
[2:21:33] just walked out of the pulpit
[2:21:36] you know what I'm talking about
[2:21:40] the devil uses your best friend
[2:21:44] and so Abraham he believed the promise
[2:21:49] and so he kept himself in an atmosphere
[2:21:52] to Abraham he didn't care if he was 200
[2:21:55] years old
[2:21:57] and he was 300 years old
[2:22:00] I can't figure out how old I'm gonna
[2:22:02] have to be to get there but I'm going to
[2:22:05] have a son because God said it
[2:22:07] [Applause]
[2:22:09] [Music]
[2:22:11] that's right
[2:22:14] and God came
[2:22:18] you know Abraham wasn't a trinitarian
[2:22:21] so he he called him Lord
[2:22:26] [Music]
[2:22:29] and since the Lord came to the house he
[2:22:31] wanted to entertain him and he's on a
[2:22:33] purpose now how he knew was by his voice
[2:22:38] he couldn't recognize him by his
[2:22:39] physical being because he had met him as
[2:22:41] a pillar of fire and
[2:22:43] walked through the Beast and you heard
[2:22:44] his voice so many times that now that
[2:22:47] voice is speaking out of that body
[2:22:49] he can't explain it all but that's him
[2:22:54] [Applause]
[2:22:56] last night he spoke to you through guys
[2:22:59] almost seven foot tall
[2:23:02] and you know you you might have felt
[2:23:04] awkward with the way that he operated
[2:23:06] for a little while but after a while if
[2:23:07] you listen long enough you heard you
[2:23:09] heard him
[2:23:11] you heard the voice behind The Voice
[2:23:14] and what he was doing was reminding you
[2:23:16] who you are
[2:23:18] and that's what Melchizedek was going to
[2:23:20] do with Sarah he's going to remind her
[2:23:23] of who she was because she had forgot
[2:23:25] who she was
[2:23:26] [Applause]
[2:23:28] she's a part of the promise
[2:23:33] and he asked her a question that I'm
[2:23:35] going to ask you
[2:23:36] is anything
[2:23:39] impossible with God
[2:23:47] can we fast forward just a little bit
[2:23:50] Abraham and Sarah
[2:23:52] it seems that they're going to get out
[2:23:54] of the will of God
[2:23:56] it seems
[2:23:59] and in their trouble
[2:24:02] they have to lie
[2:24:05] because when God does a work
[2:24:08] he does it so well
[2:24:11] it's just phenomenal
[2:24:13] he takes an old cranky woman don't get
[2:24:16] mad
[2:24:17] he takes an old cranky Church
[2:24:20] he takes an old cranky people
[2:24:24] and he makes them so beautiful
[2:24:27] [Applause]
[2:24:33] to one of the
[2:24:34] the greatest kings in the whole world
[2:24:37] over one of the most powerful Kingdoms
[2:24:41] in the whole world that can have anybody
[2:24:43] that he wants and when he sees her
[2:24:47] [Applause]
[2:24:49] he's just gotta have her
[2:24:57] I want you to think
[2:24:59] now Sarah has a revelation
[2:25:02] of what God's going to do through her
[2:25:04] womb
[2:25:10] she has a revelation now that my womb is
[2:25:13] going to produce Isaac
[2:25:15] I'm going to carry Isaac
[2:25:17] but the devil's always in the details
[2:25:21] now God allows the devil to be like a
[2:25:24] tool
[2:25:25] [Music]
[2:25:28] okay if I need a wrench I go get a
[2:25:32] wrench
[2:25:33] if I need a hammer I go get a hammer
[2:25:36] if I need a screwdriver I get a
[2:25:38] screwdriver and the devil is dumb
[2:25:43] so God's looking at laodicea and there's
[2:25:46] Abraham and Sarah now turn young again
[2:25:48] but I got a proof I got to prove I've
[2:25:51] got to write the book to where that
[2:25:53] there's going to be a people on the
[2:25:54] Earth around the world
[2:25:56] can believe I can turn them back young
[2:25:58] again because Sarah is the type
[2:26:04] [Applause]
[2:26:08] I gotta have a people I'm going to send
[2:26:10] them a message it's going to be more
[2:26:11] than Gathering a church and more than
[2:26:13] seals and more than Thunders and more
[2:26:15] than but I'm going to take their bodies
[2:26:18] and it seems like totally impossible but
[2:26:21] they should be under expectation of a
[2:26:23] body change
[2:26:25] mortal is going to become immortal and
[2:26:28] I'm going to Rapture around the entire
[2:26:30] world
[2:26:34] and on Rapture mourning no matter how
[2:26:37] difficult and how many things that
[2:26:40] Satan's thrown against him they're going
[2:26:41] to believe my word so much
[2:26:44] [Applause]
[2:26:46] [Music]
[2:26:51] now you know I just have to admit to you
[2:26:53] like you're sitting here tonight
[2:26:56] can I can I just go out on a limb here
[2:26:58] just for a minute
[2:27:07] in other kingdoms
[2:27:10] Castle
[2:27:14] knowing that in the morning
[2:27:19] in the morning this king is going to
[2:27:22] marry me
[2:27:27] how did I get here
[2:27:32] how did I come through these situations
[2:27:34] of life
[2:27:36] here I can't sleep
[2:27:39] tomorrow morning
[2:27:42] I'm going to be another man's wife
[2:27:46] and it's going to be impossible
[2:27:52] to perform what the message says
[2:27:59] now let's go to attempt
[2:28:03] there's a man with no doubt a fire
[2:28:06] outside of his tent
[2:28:08] and he's crying before God God
[2:28:12] I've messed up
[2:28:15] I'm down here out of your will it seems
[2:28:18] not knowing that God wrote the book
[2:28:21] [Music]
[2:28:23] he's just being a part of it
[2:28:27] I'm a I lied I lied yesterday
[2:28:31] to save my own skin I lied
[2:28:34] he'd have killed me for her
[2:28:37] but I lied
[2:28:40] God you came you told me for 25 years I
[2:28:43] was going to have a son with her
[2:28:45] you came and met me about a year ago
[2:28:49] I never dreamed I'd have my hair colored
[2:28:52] back I never dreamed my shoulders would
[2:28:53] be strong again but here I am in my
[2:28:56] natural Shred
[2:29:02] God not only met him
[2:29:05] back up on a hill
[2:29:07] but now
[2:29:09] because he needed a people in laodicea
[2:29:11] to catch the message
[2:29:17] [Applause]
[2:29:20] to know that it's not going to be you
[2:29:23] that gets you there
[2:29:26] that's right there's things going to be
[2:29:28] out of your control a lot of times
[2:29:32] but he's got you in the palm of his
[2:29:34] hands
[2:29:37] and let me just say this to you if I can
[2:29:39] in your most difficult moments you don't
[2:29:43] realize
[2:29:45] you're destroying the works of the devil
[2:29:50] [Applause]
[2:30:05] we invited brother Kelly Hildebran and
[2:30:07] sister Myra to come in speak for us
[2:30:11] three and a half maybe close to four
[2:30:14] years ago
[2:30:19] we had difficulty flying the other day
[2:30:23] three flights became five flights
[2:30:26] lost luggage
[2:30:28] I said in blue jeans last night
[2:30:30] you won't believe from where all the
[2:30:32] world was watching last night and I was
[2:30:34] sitting in blue jeans
[2:30:37] you might have been critical because a
[2:30:39] lot of people said I look good
[2:30:42] [Applause]
[2:30:47] as long as Connie says I look good it
[2:30:49] don't matter what anybody else is
[2:30:56] I needed you to relax so I could get you
[2:30:58] there
[2:31:00] Brother Kelly's brother flew a different
[2:31:02] Airline
[2:31:07] is he here
[2:31:09] okay your other brother's here I see him
[2:31:12] over here
[2:31:13] he's been smiling at me he must like me
[2:31:15] okay
[2:31:18] and so
[2:31:20] you know
[2:31:22] Kent is that right Kent
[2:31:25] Kent made it right on time he wasn't
[2:31:26] even a minute late he was almost early
[2:31:30] he made it absolutely wrong and you know
[2:31:32] you were supposed to be there
[2:31:34] you're supposed to be there
[2:31:36] you know and so we're getting close to
[2:31:38] services and
[2:31:41] earlier in the week
[2:31:44] the Lord spoke to me and he says now
[2:31:48] you're going to preach a sermon on don't
[2:31:49] worry
[2:31:52] don't worry
[2:31:53] well you know we're getting close and
[2:31:56] brother Kelly he's now one day
[2:31:59] he's now two days
[2:32:01] he's now three days
[2:32:03] and you know what he's still coming
[2:32:06] isn't that crazy
[2:32:09] yeah isn't that crazy
[2:32:10] you know more natural human beings just
[2:32:14] go hey I've had enough I'm going home
[2:32:21] Kent told me said you know I'll preach
[2:32:23] for you
[2:32:26] I never heard him preach
[2:32:30] we had visitors there
[2:32:32] I said well the lord gave me a sermon
[2:32:36] to preach and I'll just take that don't
[2:32:39] worry
[2:32:40] I didn't know in a couple of months what
[2:32:43] was going to be told to me
[2:32:47] and brother Kelly comes and we pick him
[2:32:49] up not in the local airport but we pick
[2:32:52] him up in Washington
[2:32:53] at a complete different airport than any
[2:32:55] of us would use
[2:32:57] and I told the audience the night before
[2:32:59] I said now you know if you'll remember
[2:33:03] you know Sarah was all fussy Stewie all
[2:33:06] kind of circumstances is going on and it
[2:33:09] was Satan trying to block the visitation
[2:33:13] so now brother Kelly doesn't realize
[2:33:16] what he's going through
[2:33:20] but it's Satan trying to block the
[2:33:22] visitation
[2:33:26] and he's got a message
[2:33:28] that's going to be real for us
[2:33:33] and so you know what brother Kelly comes
[2:33:35] and you know we were supposed to have a
[2:33:37] Sunday morning service he wasn't going
[2:33:39] to get there in time and so you know
[2:33:41] we're in the South we just changed it
[2:33:45] if you don't work to eat in the morning
[2:33:46] you eat an evening so
[2:33:49] we're getting a ride a lot of times and
[2:33:51] so
[2:33:52] you know brother Kelly we pick him up
[2:33:54] and he looks wore out as the guy right
[2:33:56] back here and
[2:33:57] and you know he's he's a lot older than
[2:34:00] that guy and
[2:34:02] not quite 40 years but he's a little bit
[2:34:04] older than that yeah
[2:34:06] Maybe 30.
[2:34:08] you know I take him to my house and he
[2:34:10] lays down about a half an hour and he
[2:34:11] insists tomorrow lay down and
[2:34:14] we get up and we go to church and
[2:34:18] you know he starts he comes to the
[2:34:20] pulpit and he starts and he's
[2:34:22] he said I got a coin I want to give
[2:34:24] present to brother Ron
[2:34:36] I'd saw the coin before on his desk
[2:34:40] thank you
[2:34:41] and I thought so much of it because
[2:34:42] there was a man it was a Normandy coin
[2:34:45] it's a commemorative coin maybe you have
[2:34:48] some of them but it's got a grain of
[2:34:50] sand on it
[2:34:53] just one grain of sand on this coin
[2:34:57] and it's in a little little nice case
[2:35:04] and you know I had a man in my church
[2:35:06] that fought at Normandy
[2:35:12] and he didn't become a Christian tilling
[2:35:14] his late 70s
[2:35:16] near 80.
[2:35:18] his name was Max
[2:35:21] was losing his mind
[2:35:23] he thought he'd been a drunk all of his
[2:35:26] life
[2:35:27] he came to church because of a funeral
[2:35:29] he liked it he liked me I don't know why
[2:35:33] I bet he liked me
[2:35:36] and Max had run the shore of Normandy
[2:35:39] and he when he left the ship the water
[2:35:41] was already bloody
[2:35:44] men was running with him and he watched
[2:35:46] them fall and he said
[2:35:48] Iran all I knew to do was run
[2:35:52] and he said I made the sand
[2:35:55] I was alive
[2:35:57] and he said I kept running through the
[2:35:59] sand
[2:36:01] and I got to the wall and he said I made
[2:36:03] the wall
[2:36:05] and he said I stood there beside of the
[2:36:07] wall and he said
[2:36:09] why did I make it
[2:36:15] he said that thought went through my
[2:36:17] life
[2:36:19] all those lives probably four decades
[2:36:21] Plus
[2:36:23] I don't want to tell you why you made it
[2:36:28] I want to tell you why you've made it
[2:36:31] [Music]
[2:36:32] [Applause]
[2:36:33] and I was preaching one night
[2:36:36] and I began to talk to him about a grain
[2:36:39] of sand
[2:36:42] you were maybe one of those grains of
[2:36:45] sand that God told Abraham about
[2:36:49] and you've been through some Wars and
[2:36:51] you've been through some turmoil
[2:36:53] and you didn't think you'd make it
[2:36:57] and it was up to you you'd have quit and
[2:36:59] you'd give up
[2:37:00] but you just kept running
[2:37:02] yeah
[2:37:04] you just kept running
[2:37:07] yeah and when you got to the wall you
[2:37:09] turned around and you was believing the
[2:37:11] message with all your heart and you said
[2:37:13] how did I
[2:37:15] of all those millions of people how did
[2:37:18] I see the message
[2:37:29] Max in the next service
[2:37:32] he generally said about the fourth row
[2:37:34] back
[2:37:36] he was old
[2:37:38] he didn't have any friends in the world
[2:37:40] he came to church
[2:37:43] loved God
[2:37:46] he went to the restroom in the middle of
[2:37:47] the service and
[2:37:50] it was getting now toward the end
[2:37:53] and I was finishing preaching and I was
[2:37:55] tired and weary
[2:37:57] and I walked back and sat down on the on
[2:37:59] a seat like this
[2:38:01] and Max walked up and put his hand
[2:38:04] on my knee
[2:38:06] and he said last night
[2:38:09] you answered the question
[2:38:12] of why I made it to the wall
[2:38:16] foreign
[2:38:27] that was Max's last service
[2:38:32] and he went home to be with the Lord
[2:38:39] when brother Kelly announced his text
[2:38:44] we will accept nothing
[2:38:48] but total victory
[2:38:59] I want to say this to you
[2:39:01] let it be ringing in your ears
[2:39:04] I was sitting there not knowing what was
[2:39:07] getting ready to happen
[2:39:11] I went to the doctor can I have just a
[2:39:14] few more minutes
[2:39:15] I went to the doctor I thought I had a
[2:39:18] prostate infection
[2:39:21] a Mennonite doctor
[2:39:23] examined spent some time with me
[2:39:26] and he said Ron I'm getting ready to
[2:39:28] send you down a dark Road
[2:39:30] and he sent me for scans
[2:39:34] well before we would get the results of
[2:39:36] the scans I had to be at brother biscoll
[2:39:38] so I was just going to fly by myself
[2:39:40] because the tickets was too high
[2:39:42] and so it was just going to be a few
[2:39:44] days tripping I was going to go
[2:39:47] and we got a call from Sister Connie's

[2:40:05] not but she called one of those agents
[2:40:08] at United
[2:40:10] and they did The Impossible thing they
[2:40:13] put me on every flight and put me beside

[2:41:20] that man setting back there

[2:41:31] from getting to the church

[2:42:10] them

[2:42:19] sand
[2:42:20] [Applause]

[2:42:37] Satan knew what you was going to tell
[2:42:39] them they were going to believe
[2:42:42] they've been going through a whole lot
[2:42:44] of things in their life
[2:42:46] God knew what they'd been going through
[2:42:48] months and weeks and situations and
[2:42:50] troubles but they're the Queen of Heaven
[2:42:54] [Applause]

[3:12:53] at the beginning of this service
[3:12:56] [Music]
[3:12:57] we said that there's more
[3:13:00] than what we see with our natural eyes
[3:13:03] in this room
[3:13:07] and there's another one that's been in
[3:13:09] this room
[3:13:11] and that's the enemy that has thrown
[3:13:13] everything at you
[3:13:16] and he's been watching this service
[3:13:19] he's been watching our reaction
[3:13:22] [Music]
[3:13:26] brother Darren Boyer we were
[3:13:29] in Kelowna a couple of years ago
[3:13:33] and you were speaking that morning
[3:13:35] and you took the Book of Job
[3:13:39] and it so spoke to me
[3:13:43] how God would tell job about Leviathan
[3:13:49] and he says who can do this but
[3:13:51] the story was not about
[3:13:54] what job was going through that's what
[3:13:56] job saw
[3:13:58] but he was trying to tell him watch what
[3:14:00] I'm going to do to the devil
[3:14:02] through this trial and you will be the
[3:14:06] Victor over it
[3:14:10] brother Kelly
[3:14:12] we spoke just a little over a few weeks
[3:14:14] ago
[3:14:15] and we shared this quote and it was
[3:14:18] precious
[3:14:20] brother Ron
[3:14:22] touched on the story of
[3:14:25] the Hebrew children that were going into
[3:14:27] the fire
[3:14:28] [Music]
[3:14:32] and brother Branham would say this he
[3:14:34] would say
[3:14:37] Daniel was the one that was there in
[3:14:39] that day
[3:14:40] he was the leader
[3:14:42] as Christ being the leader of the church
[3:14:48] but there was Shadrach Meshach and
[3:14:51] Abednego
[3:14:52] they were the church
[3:14:54] and they had to Bow before the image
[3:14:57] and worship the image but notice
[3:15:01] Daniel was silent
[3:15:04] you may have been waiting for God to
[3:15:06] take away the trial
[3:15:08] you may have been waiting for God to
[3:15:10] remove this burden
[3:15:13] but God has just allowed
[3:15:15] him to be quiet
[3:15:18] and the quote goes on to say
[3:15:20] in those times Daniel was silent
[3:15:24] oh I hope you get this he says
[3:15:27] Daniel was silent
[3:15:30] they had to make their own choice
[3:15:34] and those Hebrew children
[3:15:36] their testimony before they went in the
[3:15:39] fire even if God doesn't Deliver Us
[3:15:44] we will not bow down we will not serve
[3:15:48] this enemy I will still praise him I
[3:15:52] will still give him glory
[3:15:54] and the devil is watching and I just
[3:15:57] choose today like brother Ron did when
[3:15:59] he was sick going to church I'm going to
[3:16:02] thank the Lord because he's going to
[3:16:04] make a way through and the devil will be
[3:16:07] subject to my testimony he will be set
[3:16:10] to my reaction in this service
[3:16:15] oh my goodness and while that was going
[3:16:18] on down there the Angels were starting
[3:16:20] to rise up look look
[3:16:24] in Christ that I know
[3:16:26] God said I know
[3:16:28] this is not for you I'm gonna come down
[3:16:32] he's watching
[3:16:34] the devil's watching
[3:16:36] but I'm making my choice tonight
[3:16:38] what choice are you gonna make
[3:16:42] brother John I don't know if you
[3:16:43] remember the song I'm not going to let
[3:16:45] you go
[3:16:46] do you know that can you do that

[3:16:53] but God nobody put in you

[3:24:20] I was reading
[3:24:23] and in the age of cancer culture they're
[3:24:25] taking certain songs that are deemed to
[3:24:28] be offensive
[3:24:29] one of them was a Christian song
[3:24:32] but I pledge allegiance
[3:24:34] I want to sing this to the devil tonight
[3:24:36] because we have a champion who's given
[3:24:39] us courage and I'm going to stand behind
[3:24:42] him
[3:24:43] how many are going to stand with him
[3:24:46] now you know your trial you know what
[3:24:48] the devil's been speaking
[3:24:51] but I'm coming out
[3:24:52] and not stronger than when I went in I'm
[3:24:55] going to face the trial in a greater way
[3:24:57] than I did before
[3:25:00] I pledge allegiance to the lamb
[3:25:03] and I have heard how
[3:25:07] Christians before
[3:25:11] [Music]
[3:25:17] a time
[3:25:21] they were told
[3:25:25] [Music]
[3:25:34] the name of Christ
[3:25:38] oh but one by one
[3:25:42] they chose to Die
[3:25:46] the Son of God they would not be now I
[3:25:55] could pray
[3:25:58] [Music]
[3:25:59] [Applause]

[3:26:56] but the cause of
[3:26:59] Jesus
[3:27:01] still goes on now our time has come
[3:27:08] to count the cost
[3:27:12] or to reject all this world to embrace
[3:27:19] [Music]
[3:27:48] [Applause]
[3:27:49] [Music]
[3:27:56] allegiance to
[3:27:59] the Lamb with all my strength with all I
[3:28:08] am I will seek to wander
[3:28:14] his
[3:28:15] command
[3:28:17] I pledge
[3:28:20] allegiance too
