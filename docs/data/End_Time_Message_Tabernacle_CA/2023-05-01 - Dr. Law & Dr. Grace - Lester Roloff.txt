[Music] foreign [Music] foreign welcome everybody to the end time message Tabernacle tonight you're here for the production of Dr law and Dr Grace we're excited that our young people have put this together for you and I hope you enjoy it I just have a couple things to lay out just before we get started I'd like to keep in mind that this is still a church not a theater so please let's keep our talking our no food or drink in this sanctuary if you need to eat or drink something please just exit out through the doors you came in at and the and then also no talking during the play if you can keep your cell phones turned off if you have a cell phone with you so that way it doesn't interrupt the production as well that would be greatly appreciated washrooms if you need to use the bathroom if you head out through these main doors here follow the arrows down down the stairs there's lots of washrooms at the bottom of the stairs there and then if you if you need the handicap bathroom it's just straight down the hallway on the right hand side there's a handicap washroom there um I will say also in case of an emergency please take note of the nearest exit nearest to you there's one there there's one straight through that curtain down there back out the way you came in and uh the muster point for this church is on the north side of the building so go that way that's North and we'll make sure you head out in that direction but I believe we won't have any cases of emergency like that I will tell you that the approximately the run time is about two hours long without intermission so sit back relax and enjoy it are we ready all right thank you so much with that let's start the play and so we were talking about how the Old Testament is a type of the law and in the law we were shown how that were Sinners and that were needed Salvation And how that our lives are not perfect no matter how we live them how we try to do what's right we try to do the best we can with what we know how that there's still a law that we've got to measure up to and with the law that means that there's a penalty otherwise the law has no value and to this law the penalty of this law is death and if you don't measure up with this law you're going to die and this death is the death of hell and when you and the only way for this death to be paid is for someone to come and take your place and in Romans chapter 7 Paul would say I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me and so this law just keeps overshadowing us that everywhere we go everything we would try to do it's always there to point us and say you need something more there's something greater there's something that's got to change and therefore to accept this salvation that you need so that you don't have to go into this death you need a heart change you need a heart that can be willing to accept what God has for you Ezekiel would just say I need a new heart will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and I will cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and you shall do them with this new heart there Comes This Promise of eternal life if you accept that Christ came on a cross and he died for your sins he died so that you didn't have to pay the penalty of death yourself so that you your life that you're living That Couldn't line up with the law now can but it's not because of you but it's because someone came and took your place and many will try to say that oh you just have to do good you just have to do this if you just do some of this you just do some of that if you just be a good person if you just believe if you just do all these different things you'll make it but Paul would say it's not of Works lest any man should boast if it's something I can do then I don't need a savior something I can do then I don't need a Healer if there's something I can do then I don't need someone to come and set my life free because I can do it of myself and at that point there's no purpose of God there's no purpose of having any sort of a Creator out there but because I can't do it on my own because I need something to come and change my life that's why I need a savior and maybe there's something in your heart tonight and there's a hole you're finding there's something wrong with your heart you start realizing my heart doesn't line up with this law there's something in my heart that isn't right I got this issue I got that issue I try to measure up to the law and I can't because there's I don't have the nature change that I need to be able to measure up to this lie don't have this gift that God promised us he promised us the gift of the Holy Ghost and I need this gift because there's something in me that won't let me live this life anymore and if you have that desire tonight that you want to meet Christ and let him come and change your heart this altar is open it's free it's a free gift all you have to do is just surrender there's nothing more to it you just gotta accept that he came on the cross and that he died for your sin and that he's there to take your place that you don't have to die pretty sure I I don't know what to do with myself anymore I there's this something that just keeps coming to me night after night something deep down in my heart I can't get away from it I try to drain it out with with the things the world personal amusements and and try to find satisfaction in all the different things with no satisfaction comes I go to work I go to school I do the same thing every day and there's just no peace there's no rest in my life and I come now to this Altar and something just compelled me to come now I I don't know where to go next come let's talk to the savior Heavenly Father we come before you this evening father we bring another soul to you desires [Music] the

think too hard about it yeah just get out there hope for the best have some fun and just you'll be great really well I I I I I think that's that's good advice I I hope hope it uh but maybe maybe could you give me a second opinion a second are you kidding me you know what most people think that if they just are think they're good and that's all they need they're so happy with that advice what makes you so special we are trained professional doctors like why are you questioning us we have tons of experience we are some of the most educated people on the planet like what in the world would you want a second opinion for well I I don't know I are you just thinking and hoping your doctors I mean it says it in your name where are your phds your your education they're right behind us I hope I think and if you so desire a second opinion that is your right but you know what that is your problem and honestly people I don't know what making it so hard but why people keep making it so difficult that's beyond me you know what if you think you're good you're good end of story yeah if you don't appreciate us go see doctor be good doctor do good but you're wasting your time really yeah and you know what if you think that you know better than us you'd better also hope you can leave she said leave okay well I I well I I don't want to just think and and hope I'm right I I need to know I need to be sure in my heart that that I I know I'm right I I can't just just cover this up fill this void in my heart something it's got to be something more than this I need to see a good doctor someone who who knows what they're talking about who who's been good who's who's given to people to help people I'm going to see these doctors foreign just taking a look at your notes Here what are you in here for well uh I'm I'm having trouble with my heart uh it's something deep down inside that I just can't put a finger on it it's trouble with the cares of this life but is there anything you guys can do to help me certainly that's what we're here for you know the problem is um people these days are all the more their morals are just they're gone there's no morals people just won't be nice these days if people were nice that's what we need and uh you know everyone's all roiled up about politics and economics and inflation deflation you know affiliation Association initiation constipation be good we've got a patient what I was trying to say is no one's good these days and people just need to be nice to each other and um that's the ticket you know if you were if you were nice you know and good if you're a good person which I know you can be all your worries will take care of themselves I'm sure not not so Hasty here um there's something to be said for being kind to your neighbor uh but it doesn't stop there okay uh there's like many many people that are poor the less fortunate on the streets all they have is the clothes on their back that's right think of those um think of the one how you could just help them a little bit better but you gotta shoot for those ones and you can't just be a talker be gonna be a walker you can't be a walker but you gotta be a talker you gotta talk to talk and walk the walk you gotta be a doer that's good I do try to do I I don't know when was the last time you passed by like uh one of those homeless fellows did you treat him like a human being did you give him a nod it's all about your attitude if you can do that I'm sure you'll make it I well I I do yeah it's that sort of thing right there like think about Charities hey um how much do you make in a year well uh thirty thousand yeah um so three thousand dollars goes to groceries twenty seven thousand goes to charity and that's it bare minimum 95 bare minimum and uh the Golden Rule give on to others that's all you need to know the rest doesn't matter um you've just got to be a good person and everything will take care of itself and I'm sure you I'm sure it will all right facts right there you know the other day I volunteered at the local uh I was about a week ago I volunteered at the local animal shelter and uh just looking after all those poor animals you know I just I knew I was making a difference they made a difference on me you know probably noticed my little limp there I almost got my toe bitten off but uh I'm not gonna even gonna say well I was being good though I was being good yeah but um it's the little things that count you know my heart just felt yes my heart my heart yes your heart exactly exactly your heart practice good works it'll make your heart feel better like you know what it's not it's not a bad thing to be goody two shoes it could be even goody three shoes seven goody seven shoes yeah yeah and that's okay people make fun of you being goody seven shoes goody eight she's good she's getting 10 shoes and uh they're gonna make fun of you and that's just perfect because you deserve better than them anyway those that are making fun of you they probably don't give 27 000 to charity they probably see and at that um you just gonna do good and actually I gotta go I do have to volunteer at a chair uh at a bingo night family bingo tonight it's been really good it's I give me your hat I pray that you I pray that you find exactly what you're looking for but at that I'm out of here well he's out yeah but I'm here to leave too but be good take care you heard the doctor get out there be good and if you need a list of uh need a Good Charity to look for online you can look at my website at drbood all the time.com but and it's really good and um you're looking to be good right there's all sorts of good things on there you want to be good it's good check it out have a good one bye bye what they're saying is all true but there's got to be more to that there's got to be more than just hoping and thinking I'm right and doing it and being good I gotta know and take a seat I'll be with you in a moment well then how can I help you well miss I've I've seen the doctors you referred to me I've seen doctor think so and hope so I I've seen the doctors they referred to me Dr do good and Dr be good but they're just hoping and thinking they're right they're they're doing good and it's good things but it just doesn't go deep enough for me it there's still something nagging it they're good thoughts they're they're kind they're helpful but it just it's something still aching in my heart something's still empty oh you seem to be a bit more of a complex case uh uh well if they didn't satisfy you then maybe you'd like Dr knowledge I can check if you like sure yeah it starts with the k there was a cancellation actually so I can squeeze you in today um um but his treatments they they do take a little bit more time and effort I'll see whoever you tell me see I I want to fill this void in my heart I I I'm not your average client well here's your referral and just down the hall again well thank you um Dr knowledge oh hey young man how are you doing please please take a seat take a seat relax sit down tell me why did you come into my office oh well where do I begin doctor I I have an empty feeling and in my heart trouble with the cares of this life seen many other doctors but none of them seem to have the answer is there anything you can do to help me hmm ah I see I see right right very very fascinating very fascinating you're a very fascinating case seems to me that you seem to be suffering from some sort of degree of mental disorder yes or deep emotional distress have you considered a self-improvement program Tommy Robinson has the top program in the country yes that's the ticket it most definitely will help you well I I guess I could deserve a pamphlet or something you can give me on it right here young man well I I guess I've heard of it but I I doctor I I don't think I think this will still go go deeper than this I no doubt it would help me it would it would it would do good things just maybe touch the surface but I'm just not sure if this is the answer it it's a good program but I just don't think it'll go deep enough to to make a difference that would count to satisfy the longing in my heart hmm well if that's not good enough for you perhaps we should set you up with a therapist I do indeed think that you need help yes a therapist can sit down with you yes and discuss all your troubles in life he will get that head on straight and iron out all those hard tough feelings bothering you doctor I I'm sorry I I'm not I'm having a hard time understanding how how sitting down and talking with someone would make a difference said I I don't think that would be the best answer right you know no doubt it would help some people and it does help people it would make me feel good for sure but I just don't think we'll get to the root of the problem I I don't think this is something a therapist will help me with huh huh I see I see hmm this seems to be a very more serious case than I thought oh my oh my I have to make a very strong recommendation and I believe that you you need a psychiatrist yes a psychiatrist now I can assure you that with proper therapy and uh a follow-up that when our top team of professionals that we can get that get you settled and fix where you stand yes I hundred percent guarantee that will fix you a psychiatrist doctor we just talked about a therapist and I don't this isn't a mental health issue doctor I it's something with my heart it's deep down in my heart and I need something else other than a psychiatrist it's just it's not going to work is there anything else that you can do for me um look all right Captain good faith let you leave without giving you my top recommendation yes yes why don't we consider a trial of antidepressants yes that'll work or some anxiety medication yes that will work we can start the medication well now just a small dose you know take things slow easy and having regular follow-up yes and then we can dial you in yes and we will think about putting you on maybe a bigger dose over time yes we'll do that until those little feelings that are bothering you are just go numb and everything will be all right yes you'll finally be able to live your life day to day without feeling any anxiety yes or at least keep it manageable we'll have we can work at how taking this care of starting well tomorrow actually trust me I have a strong background in this I know obviously what I'm talking about and you're not my first patient nor will you be the last medication is always the answer doctor I I'm sorry I I just don't think this is for me I thanks I I'm sure I I'm sure this is the right hand I no doubt I mean this would help some people you know it does good it it helps people but this is something deeper than just anxiety or conscience or or taking taking this pill it's not going to change who I am who I've seen who I am as a person that my nature it's not going to change it there's there's a nature to to lie to lust to to do the things I know aren't right you know I well I've heard it said that if you love the world or the things of the world then the love of God isn't even in you well my boy I can't jump medicine down your throat unfortunately I if I could I would yes as I feel very strong about it as a doctor and your doctor I can only just recommend as I highly do here take this medical pamphlet pick this one too there you go yes read over it study it and think about it if you have any questions or concerns or you're more than welcome to talk to me one thing I will say though it sounds to me like you're getting a little religious yeah nothing wrong with that I just don't feel that uh religion is the answer right I mean this is a serious medical issue like you're the psychic with the psychiatric trouble you're having in any case I mean if you do feel religion is the answer I can assure you I know the top Minds in the field that a studied religion extensively doctors that understand well the Greek the Aramaic the Hebrew yes they know the scriptures inside and out and backwards for sure they have the answer to answer all your questions I just know that you know if you feel it necessary they may send you back to me here I've made you a referral for Dr religion yes okay Dr religion and their team have been looking after the needs of patients for thousands of years yes and they are experts at coming up with Solutions and Lifestyles that are you know tailor-made just for you and they'll find some uh flavor religion that will just suit your needs and and you know get your head on straight and you know take it all together doing good being good and uh take your meds of course don't forget your medication yes and with their regime I can assure you it'll clear up your conscience and give you a solid rest at night well or a modest fee of cars you know hey buddy young man okay just go down the hill here and good luck my boy okay see you later well I mean that's all right but I just don't think that's that's enough it hasn't gone deep enough yet I still need need more more help well I'll go see the doctor as a religion that doctor knowledge referred me to look I have a vacation coming up on my new luxury Villa this weekend I need my new private jet ready by Monday like yes I don't want to use one of my three other smaller ones yes no no no no no no no stop I don't want to hear it God revealed to me I need this bigger plane there's too many demons in the regular planes goodbye oh father welcome father hello doctors of religion I I was referred to you by Dr knowledge is there anything you guys can do for me or yeah we looked over your chart and uh we uh you know we we had to look over it tell us more tell us more um well doctors I I believe it's a problem with my heart you know I'm having trouble with the cares of this life I'm trying to get my heart right I I've seen the other doctors but they just haven't been able to give me an answer you know looking at from your medical abstract that we just looked at we know exactly what's wrong with you really yeah my friend my friend yes you have a hole deep inside your heart and we have the answer to fill that hole you know you don't have any Fellowship card with us typical denomination today and your that hole in your heart will be filled like and the best part is it's free yeah you know after signing up all you got to do is show it simple simple equation there and uh keep regular attendance you know if you start missing a service or two you might get that certain look and they might start worrying about you a little bit you know your condition might be backsliding we don't need that also don't forget to pay your clinical ties and offering that's admissions that's vital for the clinic co-work and for you don't forget that and uh our documents say if you bless the clinic the windows of heaven will pour a blessing ten times back upon you you know consider it an investment in yourself you need to give we can tell you're not giving enough you need to give and give and give of yourself till it hurts because that hurt will feel the hurt it will fill that hurt that's in your soul right now and you'll be a new man you know and also some other secondary things would be like memorizing the medical vials and like medical texts the godhead Therapies yeah you gotta also say thanks now for before you go to bed and before you know everybody else mom's not there to hold your hand and to to do that for you you're you got to take on the responsibility that you're in you know that's probably the main cause of the hole in your heart I think so you need to give more thanks like just just pour out the thanks but you know also you need some good social fun like you can't be all holy holy holy you know you need to go out there have some good clean fun like we offer clinical potlucks choir practices hey speaking of choir practices this guy looks like a good singer I mean you look like the guy that we'd be looking for for a cover for our soprano we've been praying yeah we're praying a long time right now that's it right there that's it right there oh listen we have the answer we are members of the medical establishment of ordained Bishops you just come and if you just do what we have told you your heart will be so full it'll just be like bubbling over don't listen to anyone else this is your answer oh boy oh yes sir wow thank you for your help but I I just feel it's not enough I everyone's giving me the answer it seems like they're giving me the same answers and I leave with the original problem regardless of what they tell me I don't I have this hole in it in my heart and I don't want to cover it up fill it or bundle it up it's my life I and if it is my heart I can't risk I can't risk my my life I have one life and it I would die if I lost my heart I can't risk it I you all seem to be saying the same thing is there not just another doctor you can refer me to what another doctor you're joking right no I did you not see the priest raise his hands nod his head well yeah I I did but if you want to accept our ancient Creeds then you're lost you're hopeless there's nothing we can do for you like it's that plane if you want to accept it there's nothing we can do for you like I'm sorry and as for other doctors there's the old-fashioned doctor Inspirations I shouldn't have said his name Dr love you know he said the same things from the since the beginning of time he hasn't kept up with our modern medicine like his practices you wouldn't even want to go near them like and like he wanted to bulldoze our beautiful Mega clinics people gave of themselves in order to receive a blessing he wants to bulldoze people's blessings hey you want to go to him he even called the thieves and hypocrites he has no place in this organization if you want to go to him then I'm sorry you won't take our expert advice you're lost what am I going to do is Dr live and still around I haven't seen him since we kicked him out of our denomination years ago I just saw him the other day he said something about Jezebel's painted face [Applause] Excuse Me Miss I you know I've I've been to see these other doctors I still don't have an answer to this problem I've been searching for there has to be more I need help The more I've I've looked the worse it's gotten I'm very sorry to hear that you seem to be having no luck with any of our doctors which is very unusual most people are quite happy with the common answers is there anyone else I can see that the doctors of religion they they mention another doctor his name was Dr law doctor law that's been a very long time since I heard that name Dr Lop um I don't know if it's on my book let me let me take a look um I'll take a look hey how are you doing I'm good it's good to see you I I don't know I am I haven't been able to find any help yet none of the doctors have had the answer I I'm looking for right the secretary is trying to get me appointment with Dr law yeah we all have to measure up with the law at some point everybody has a meeting with him just have to accept it um you already have an appointment with Dr law for this day and this hour before the foundation of the world actually well I I'm stunned I but I'm glad you're here for such a time as this I'm here to be with you and help you pray Dr law is the best at what he does there is no trouble he can't diagnose there's no question he doesn't have the answer for but his sayings are hard and few can bear to hear them I guess I'll go see him where is he thank you foreign [Music] conquer this storm in my mind don't let me cross on over over God's mercy in life [Music] Lord I'm living and I'm walking [Applause] I've tried to repent but I can't see the angel Satan is used [Music] [Applause] [Music] Lord I know that there's a day [Music] [Applause] [Music] but if I could just breathe the shackles [Music] I promise to never say turn again don't let me grow over [Music] over God's mercy on don't let yours speak the last time I prayed and you've gone the storm is in my mind don't let me cross over over God's mercy alive [Music] don't let me cross over over God's mercy line [Music] Excuse me yes Dr law yes come on in so nice to see you I'm suspecting you're just going over you you folded there and who's this young man this Minister nice to meet you minister yeah so we've been expecting you we don't really have many people come to see me but I'm sure glad to see it what's bothering you no doctor I know my life isn't right it's been hitting me up inside of all right I've been to see other medical doctors at this clinic and none of them have the answer that I'm looking for there's still something negging at me in my heart my Minister has told me that everyone has an appointment with Dr law at some point well I'm glad that could be under these circumstances instead of when everything's going wrong is there anything you can do to help me certainly certainly we can take a look we folder and uh see what a record says why don't you take a seat [Music] I'll be praying for you for you Dr London Maurice let's go over your folder here and so tell me how has your hearing been well I I guess I I could say that I I do think it's been all right I hmm I do it enjoy listening to some some good clean wholesome Christian music you know clean lyrics I hope that that's that's what that's what I even listening to yeah hmm okay sure let's take a look [Music] see loads of Filth in here really low to filter in here my goodness see Dolores can be clean and as good as you want them to be but the question is what is the spirit and the attitude behind what you listen see we're living on age where [Music] you need discernment and all right from wrong now I don't know about I feel like you're suffering from a very severe case of each and years yes each and years I'm afraid that you have you have damage years I'm freely you've done so but anyways how has your vision been wow I guess I better tell the truth try not to watch bad things but you know you struggle with some shows television shows some movies worries you know you can be watching something good but the next thing you know something pops up and you're you're watching something that isn't edifying it doesn't help you you know it and there's dark moments when when you're ensnared with lustful images with things that you know shouldn't be looking at Grace you know what I I say how can you overcome how can you get away from these things if it's right at your fingertips all the time that's a good question that's a very good question anyways let's take a look [Music] he always discard [Music] badly scared hmm seemed to be softened from very bad case of the Lost of the oil it's very interesting tell me how many are people that come to see me well not many people as we said few come to see me but it's very interesting hey you know almost the ones that come have the very same issue the lust of the oil you know the scriptures don't say that the oil is to get to your soul you know what the things that you've been watching has been affecting your soul even though it does look like it's not really affecting your soul But as time goes on eventually start to realize that yes something has happened and I'm not the same the scripture does also said that if you look at the woman to load stuff to her you have committed adultery in your heart no doubt you've done that based on that well surely you're perishing you're on your way to death of course the scripture does say that thou shall not commit adultery and the adulterers will not enter into the kingdom of heaven I'm very afraid that the times you've looked that have caused you to to destroy your heart and have a darkness and blackness in there as a matter of fact I think you're only aware to that unfortunately but anyways let me carry on here tell me how has your tongue been yeah you know [Music] well it's easy to just say a little white lie you know you're sitting quietly yeah a little bit of a half truth okay you know you're you're sitting with friends you're cutting up you're laughing and the next thing you know you've tore that someone's character down by saying something rude saying cussing swearing at them hmm you know I believe in times even in traffic where you cut someone off and they cut you off well you call that man a fool fool probably worse worse really you keep speed limits we're all doctor you're the law so you you must know I don't hmm I guess obviously well I know less let's take a look at your tongue pull a date here um see I'm afraid that you on Bridal tongue has poisoned you completely and you end this as I told you that but anyway so I want to take a look at your reflex here just put your feet just kind of you know rectangle there for me well thank you very much I got nice pants here nice well this might be a little person okay all right how dare you do that to me you shouldn't do that to me how do I give you some of that back no come there come on WOW you've had a very bad case of temper Don't You Know The Temper breathes loads of sicknesses and diseases you know it's easy to last say to people very easy you know someone step on your toe go back tell them all you have to tell them that's all you may say well that's right that's that's the way it approaches but we live in an age that's an age of broadly kindness there's an age where I was supposed to love one another supposed to be kind to one another not to have temper and the last shade for every issue one try to get back to someone or try to make things equal and do all that that's not what we've been called to do but for sure I can notice that you quite a case your temper is very bad [Music] well up until now we haven't seen anything positive son all I can see is your mistakes and your faults by the way what do you do during the weekends oh doctor first I'm sorry I I didn't mean to lash out to you oh it's okay it's okay everyone who comes here does it it's all right I'm used to what do you do the weekend well on the weekend day probably go places I shouldn't go hmm take this a walk Where Angels Fear to walk hmm you know go places where no man made in the likeness of God should go now I go to movie theaters clubs to bars concerts hmm right so what do you do last Friday well probably went out and got a little bit under the influence tell me what influence probably got a little drunk and drunk woke up didn't know where I was crooked part syndrome crooked passenger half see we live in the world you can go wherever you want to go itself is not really sin for you to go where you want to go but actually where you go is reflection of what is on the inside of you [Music] and as I said your heart has got troubles and darkness in there and obviously that's why you've been you've been led to these kind of places all I can see is just that that anyways let me perform my law my last test here before you before we move on to draw a conclusion I'm gonna check and hear your heartbeat okay [Music] breathe in okay well that clearly confirms are everything that's what you've said um see all your symptoms are pointing to one root cause [Music] doctor you have a broken heart doctor said there is a peace missing in your heart see this wrong is a long Ronin bloodline defect the goal is all the way down to the first man and the first woman and this of course your hearts to be wounded what do I what do I do I you know some people can do something about it but not everyone can [Music] Dr I I don't know what you mean by bloodline defect you're telling me there's a missing piece in my heart yes um see I'm sorry boss it doesn't matter how good you are it doesn't matter whether your big man your small mind it doesn't matter you're rich you're poor I I do I try to do good things I that is not the issue see everyone is born with this problem in the heart everyone is Born This Way as we told you it goes all the way back then to your ancient ancestors see because of the failure rights at the beginning you are a condemned Ma in other words you sit on that right name you are a past house of corruption all the symptoms as you could see from your reaction does clearly tell that the only aware to die okay but doctor I I can't accept I can't accept that I I'm good for nothing here's your trifold your medical abstract take a look at it see right in there it's written average and you did wrong since you're throwing or your age of accountability everything you did wrong all the lies you told all the times that you look to the woman in the wrong way all the time is told everything you did wrong well there are some gotens in there too for sure but you see the good times do not change the fact that you have a piece missing in your heart doctor I you're telling me there's no hope or Escape that there's nothing I can do to get rid of this I've tried everything there's no hope I know you've tried everything as a matter of fact you know the the people that have been you know conducting studies for thousands of years is almost more than two thousand years now the David conducting stories trying to find a solution a solution to to fill this void in the heart of man some try to use Medical ways some try to tell you just be good some try to tell you you know if you think you're good you know some say religion is the answer and they've got some points in there but you see the problem here is that all the stories they've conducted they've all come to an end doctor there's nothing else see the only way the only way the only way that you are going to be able to save your heart from the moment of your birth was for you to follow every letter in this book without making even one mistake literally every letter not one mistake but you see right when you wake up when you're bad from bed in the morning you've already broken about 10 of them so what there's not much there's nothing else but a death sentence is is there not no one else nothing see in my job as I told you very few people come here and I was surprised to see you but see in my career all I have done is to just issue death sentences and um I'm sorry but I think to that you just received your death sentence well I'm sorry there's no one else you know of nothing else you can experienced her let me tell you a story there's a colleague of mine we went to school together [Music] you know we used to call him the man that can turn on the light it's very fascinating told me when we went to school [Music] we'll have an assignment and we'll spend hours sometimes to spend days and days trying to solve a problem I will sit there we'll try everything we can and we just can't seem to solve it but then he'll just walk in and when he walks in and in a question of moments seconds he just finds the solution and solves the problem [Music] we all graduated from the Old Testament School of Law but after graduation he he decided to further his education so he made his way to calvary's mainton Academy [Music] and there he obtained a degree a degree for every hard case you know cases that come to me thus you know I draw a conclusion and say it is impossible he says it is possible cases that come to me that have absolutely no hope like your case he says there is hope and there's freedom cases that come to me that literally their cases of debt you need to go to the graveyard and be buried right away but he says there is life [Music] he's a very special man doctorate who is this man [Music] I'll never forget his name Dr Grace can you tell me where to find Grace [Music] see you don't need to find Grace Grace has been searching for you [Music] Grace on yep see I want to know you know is that I was called to to point to the way and Grace takes off from where I live [Music] see as we told you you don't need to find them but if you look for Grace will find you [Music] come on up here come on with me [Music] all you have to do is just just Reach Out Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he passes boy Grace will find you trust me grass will find you [Music] Dr Gray doctor Dr law didn't even tell me where to find Dr Grace [Music] I don't even know where to find them laughs he said he would lead me but he leads me to Grace but I just don't know it it's a hard thing to understand [Music] maybe the secretary will know minister right where's the secretary I [Music] Dr law told me that he would lead me to Dr Grace but he but he only gave me shadows and hints it's good you're looking for Grace but the thing is Grace has been searching for you and he will pick up where Dr law left off he stands in the same place Grace has prepared for you before the beginning of time tell me do you know Grace I sure do he's the reason I'm living he's the reason I'm here today he's the reason I'm standing he had the answer for my life when all my heart was broken and battered and torn he came and made me whole again he's the one that can do it he can make the difference if he did it for me he can do it for you his remedy always stays the same he's the same yesterday today and forever perfect in all his ways if you go back to the office of Dr law there you will find Dr Grace well thank you [Music] everything has come to this moment I had an appointment with Dr law before the foundation of the world and now I'm here to to see Dr Grace has been looking for me this whole time [Music] and now the time has come to meet Dr Grace I hope he's been expecting me foreign I've been waiting for you so long come on have a seat Dr Gray site let us reason together I say rest you said you've been waiting for me you know me I know law was but you said you knew me friend before you ever came to this Clinic before you ever came looking I've been watching and following your case rest you and you already know what the law is showing what the record has shown to even say take a look take a look doctor I [Music] I just seen this with Dr Light [Music] where where are all these problems I don't understand how it where are they when I look at that chart I see only one problem your broken heart everything else it's just a symptom of it carried on down through the blood corrupted that's why you need a new life a new nature a new heart you must be born again [Music] doctorate what about these other problems I know that those other things that are bothering you they seem like great mountains challenges in your way but don't worry we look after your heart all those other things we'll take care of them as we need to well doctor what must I do [Music] like I said before you need a new heart you're going to need an operation I know you've been to see all those other doctors looking for an answer [Music] good things to say but when it comes to this operation there's some work that we got to do to get you ready well what what does this work what what are you gonna do what I have here for you is the prescription the answers that you're going to need the God's bills you need to take them every day and you'll find that it's going to start to make change in your life in the morning in the evening when you have a moment [Music] study take them a little bit at a time simple truths but be careful if you go too long without taking them you're going to find that your heart might start to harden up you'll get a little bit less sensitive to the things that matter [Music] what's in them I I just take a look and read through that medical literature you're going to need to study it meditate it'll teach you how to walk upright how to look after that new heart once you get it we don't want to give someone a heart who's going to treat it irresponsibly but I don't want you to worry if you find that you're struggling you're welcome to call on me at any time I'll always answer now I might make you work for it can't just give you everything without making sure that you are ready for it but I promise you Ethan if you seek you will find Doctor this this looks complicated it there's verses that they just seem to don't make sense [Music] if you find you lack wisdom again just ask I'll never upgrade you for searching out the things of Truth and life and if you ask I will give you assistance liberally well I I guess I can do that again now study alone is not going to be enough you're going to need to exercise those things that you've learned to practice what you preach you're going to have to have faith that the treatment is going to work and you're going to have to trust in me [Music] that the prescription is going to bring you what you need it's going to get hard once you start taking those God's pills and things start to change I know it's going to get hard so you'll be there for me to help me and I will I appreciate that there's some warnings that I have to give well it can be very serious warnings what are These Warnings that the god spills have some very strong drug drug interactions now you've been to see all those other doctors out there they have good things to say many people come to them with needs and they have answers some of them are very good answers but they don't tend to mix very well with the old-fashioned God spills one of the things that you'll find is if you try to mix the things of the world with the things that are in this book it's going to cause conflict you won't find answers you only find more questions picture log in the middle of the desert don't ask me how I got there without Old Log is it sits there dry arid Wasteland [Music] that log could sit for hundreds thousands of years and it'll still be a log but now you take that same log and you drop it into a nice flowing river brimming with life flowing eternally and what are you going to find the log doesn't drink that water it doesn't have life of its own that law will start to rotten and crumble twice as fast as if it had just laying on the forest floor [Music] well these God's pills are there any side effects to them there are many side effects to the god spills some of them can be quite strong [Music] your interests are going to change you think about some of those things that you once used to do things that you used to enjoy not all of it's bad but even then the things that once took Center Stage the things that once meant the most to you it might start to change to shift your priorities will change along with that can sometimes be a very heavy price [Music] you have friends family relationships you hung out together you did the same things you enjoyed the same things and if you start to change how can two walk together lest they agree now this is a work that is in you the change is taking place in you your heart's going to grow more sensitive [Music] and you watch others doing things that you once did sometimes it'll grieve you you hear them say things do things that you know aren't right but I don't want you to try to fix them that's not your job it's not your place you leave that to me but remember they don't understand they haven't walked the road that you've walked they're not taking the same God's bills that you are they might be content with some of those symptom blockers that are out there you're going to find that there's things in life things that you used to consider very important your job your education even your own family sometimes but this is going to take first place that life as it's living out through you there's going to be something inside of you that makes you want to protect that [Music] those other things they're still important they're good they're necessary you need them for this life and they have their place but that's the backdrop to what really matters oh Grace I this sounds like a very hard narrow road to travel [Music] but I I do believe I'll make it through it I know you will that's why you're here I have to ask though what what is this operation going to entail ah it's a good question first we're gonna have to get you ready [Music] you might think that's complicated but it's not you take the God's bills every day as I said study meditate prepare and you'll find that little by little as you prosper along the way you've made yourself ready the book even says so when it comes to the operation itself we're going to wash you clean you up the antiseptic of the word trust me when I say nothing unclean makes it through that water you're going to need a blood transfusion to change out the old life for the new after all we wouldn't want a rejection of that new heart once we go in we'll do some cutting have to go through and take out some of that worldly excess things that so easily beset you [Music] but I want you to know that I know exactly how much you can take and I won't go any further than you can bear we're going to remove the old heart and we're going to give you a new one [Music] heart from a living donor one that willingly gave his own life to save yours doctor what is this going to cost me same as it cost me it's going to cost you everything thank you everything that you thought was important when you're laying in bed at night those old dreams those desires that you had they can be for good things nothing wrong with having Ambitions in this life we want good things for you to have a good life but there might be something down inside where your own conscience is going to drive you that those dreams those ambitions might have to be turned aside changed you're going to watch as others build kingdoms and gather riches [Music] but perhaps for you you might have to endure hardship pain suffering if that's the measure that it takes is to keep your heart humble remember those others they went and they seen other Physicians they found an answer that satisfies them [Music] and when they look at you they're not going to understand that you went and took the surgical approach they might mock you and the same with those other doctors [Music] they're going to come and they're going to find out if you actually have what you say you have if you've actually been cured they're going to want to run tests those medical trials gotta love them everyone's got them but you have to remember that before they ever get to you they had to walk straight into my office they had to stand in front of my face and they had to get permission from me before they could ever come in front of you doctor your permission so are you the head surgeon the head physician I know of no other doctor like me I care greatly about every one of my cases of all those that are assigned to my caseload I won't lose one not a one doesn't matter what it takes they're going to walk right through that door the same way that you did oh and I'm waiting for that last one even if it's on their hands and knees they will come I'm jealous over every one of my cases with a great jealousy you can look in your chart the very hairs on your head they are numbered you're not going to lose one of them huh wow tell me how that's possible hmm do you understand everything I've told you so far wow this is a very hard saying what you're telling me how can anyone make it through if this cost is so great I don't want you to worry I don't want you to worry every one of my patients everyone who's on my caseload are covered by one of the best companies out there Blessed Assurance Unlimited absolutely fantastic nothing but good things to say well I I've never heard of them but do they offer graveyard plot Insurance oh that's some of the best some of the best you're promised you're covered by their policy if you have to leave this world that way one of these days you're going to walk right back out wow how do you know they can back that up I had to prove it had to show that the policy held that the prescription works so I took a little trip went and visited the graveyard myself spent about three days or so there met up in old acquaintance of mine he and I don't get along so much these days he had some keys I took him back from him he wasn't too keen on that okay but the prescription held the policy withstood the test and it will for you too I would like to hear more about that search the literature I gave you there they would testify of me well it tests five of you they you helped write these hmm I am the author and the finisher the first and the last if you don't see me in every chapter and in Reverse every line go back and read it again you probably missed something and throughout the ages I had trusted men and colleagues write down what it is that I told them to say well I'll have to watch for that when I'm reading this [Music] I want to encourage you Ethan [Music] when you lay down those dreams you'll have peace when the money Runs Out you're not sure where to go I'm not sure what to do remember that Blessed Assurance supplies your needs when those other doctors come to test you remember that I am your medical advocate and I will speak for you there have been others who have gone before you they've had that same surgery themselves that same change of heart and as that heart beats inside of them they're going to want to do everything that they can to help you the next person that comes their way they'll do everything that they can that's their nature and I want you to remember that you will have direct access 24 7 to the surgeon who invented perfected designed and mandated this procedure Dr this must not just be some average surgeon hmm who will it be me my grace is sufficient for thee have faith even entrust that the procedure will work I go to prepare a place for you [Music] and when your surgical slot is ready I'll call for you to come up higher oh everyone that thirsteth Come Ye to the waters he that has no money Come Ye by and eat yea come by wine and milk without money and without price wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me an ee that which is good let your soul Delight itself in fatness incline your ear unto me and come unto me here and your soul shall live and I'll make an Everlasting Covenant with you even the sure mercies of David Isaiah 55 verse 1 to 3. [Music] well I've I've done all that I can do told Dr Grace that I would follow through I've followed every word I'm just waiting for Grace's call you know it's interesting how some people they they seem to get called right away they go up and they ask and they're treated right there but some others they they have to work it out over time with fear and trembling sometimes it seems like we have to wrestle all night to get the heart changed yeah don't exactly know why that is there's no easy answer to it but it's something to do with the preparation for a heart that can take time all must be made perfect everything must be in order because Grace cannot fail he knows his patience he has a tailor-made surgery just for them he knows exactly what they need did you do as he asked I have I'm just waiting for the call [Music] [Music] thank you I must be him hello [Music] Dr Grace yes I'm ready that was Dr Grace he told me it's time you know he said he's more eager than me [Music] that's wonderful I can go with you and help you just one thing that's important is that final decision is you and Dr Grace alone no one can stand in that place with you you gotta stand there alone no father mother pastor friend no one can stand [Music] it's just between you and Grace but I'll be there to keep an atmosphere while the operation happens wow thank you for being here you've been more than a friend to me I'm here because you create that atmosphere just remember when it comes that time it's you and him [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] jerk the pews and all the decorations too until the congregations few then have Revival tell your friends that this is where the party ends until you're broken for your sins you can't be social then seek the Lord and wait for what he has in store and know that great is your reward so just be faithful cause you can sing all you want to yes you can sing all you want to sing all you want to and still get it wrong worship is more than a song thank you [Music] and take a break from all the plans that you have made and sit at home alone and wait for God to whisper and beg him please to open up his mouth and speak and pray for real upon your knees until they blister Shine the Light on every corner of your life until the pride and lust and lines are in the open [Music] cause you foreign [Music] must not worship something that's not even worth it so Clear the Stage makes space for the one who deserves it [Music] anything I put before my God is an idol anything I want with all my heart is an idol foreign [Music] [Music] or sing all we want to yes we can sing all we want to do all we want to and still get it wrong worship is more than a song please Clear the Stage and set the sound and light sublims if that's the measure you must take to crush the idol [Music] wait wait wait wait wait just about just a bit yeah oh here they come oh yeah come in come in welcome Ethan you're right on time hello Ethan Pastor perazak wonderful to see you again it's been a little bit of preparation time but finally here how are you feeling good yeah excellent excellent Dr law and I we've been getting things ready and there's a little bit more work left to do but oh yeah it's all good yeah this is a holy place it's a sacred place you must be dressed in clean robes to stand here so we'll have to go and get you dressed now these angels are watching over you to keep you I've given them charge over you do as they tell you all will be well pastor parazon you've been here many times before you remember that little room I will meet you in there I have a road prepared for you you'll be helping us to keep an atmosphere be nice to have you all right we'll see you soon you lead the way God prophesied through the prophet and he said I'll write my heart my laws in their hearts where I put them in the tables of their hearts showing that there would be one day the dwelling place of God in the human heart not in the human head but in the human heart and he said I'll write them in their heart and and they'll keep my statutes and so forth saith the Lord God said at another place in Ezekiel he said I will in that day take out your old fleshly Stony heart and I'll give you a new spirit and a new and then I'll give you my spirit two steps two parts a lot of people even good Christian people a lot of people get mistaken in that they get a new spirit it's not it's not God's spirit yet it's the new spirit that they get to that they can get used to get along with themself and get along with their brothers and sisters but it's not yet God's spirit it isn't God they might get a little happy they might get a new spirit and jump up and down and run over the floor shout a little bit maybe they would speak in a new tongue they would run a little bit and think they've got the Holy Ghost but it's not it yet it's just that new spirit after he gave you your spirit then he said I'll put my spirit in you after that that's what's the matter with many a Christian today many people will call themselves a Christian and do those things that they ought not to do still it's the person we're after tonight you get a change of heart you get a change of diet that's right that's good you don't want the things of the world no more certainly not but when you come into the glory of God when you come into that place like Aaron the prophet entered into the holiest of holies and slipped into behind that inner Veil and and Aaron walked in there and that Veil dropped in behind him the world know nothing about it anymore he was shut off from the world and a man that ever fully surrenders his heart and life man woman boy or girl who dares to take God at his word and say God sanely sincerely I come to you with all my heart give me that new birth in My Heart Lord and stand there under the bloody cross and believe it with all your heart something then will come to you brother something then will come to you sister God will shut away all the world and all the things of the world and it will become dead and all the things that pertain to the world will be dead you'll love you'll be hidden away there's a great artist I can't think of his name now but he painted the famous picture of Jesus knocking at the door I think he was a Greek man and when he came he he spent years of painting and and there was every famous picture as a note every famous picture will have to go through every piece of art will have to go through a hall of critics before it will go through and be landed in the Hall of Fame but the critics came as they always do and and one of the critics said I came to the painter and said there's just one thing that you lack in your picture and and the painters the painter said oh well what is that and he said well you have a door but it has no latch on the outside and the painter said oh but I painted it that way that's the way it is you have the latch on the inside and Christ is on the outside knocking Christ cannot open your heart you have to Christ is the one he can neither go into the closet that you've got yourself shut up in there you've got the latch in your own power but it's his goodness to stand there and knock some time ago down in the South there was a story of an old Minister that he was a wonderful old brother and he had a a man that was with them or in and around the church but he wouldn't come to church they couldn't convince him the church his name was Gabriel and they called him old Gabe and they would say well why don't Gabe why don't you come to church and he said oh I will someday and one day he and the minister went hunting and now old Gabe was a was a very poor shot he couldn't hit nothing but they went hunting that day and they hunted all day long and they came in the evening and they were so loaded until they could neither hardly wait they had rabbits and Duck and birds all over them until they couldn't hardly walk and old Gabe was so loaded and he was back behind the pastor and he could hardly pack his gun and while they made their way down an old familiar pathway old Gabe walked up and tapped that Pastor on the shoulder and he had tears in his eyes and the Pastor said what's what's the matter Gabe and he said Parson Sunday morning that's tomorrow Sunday morning you're going to find me at the mourner's bench and I intend to take my place in the church until death sets me free and the Pastor said I'm so glad to hear that but I have a question for you why the sudden change was it a sermon I preached to you or was it something I said or something I did or something that a friend did he says oh no it wasn't that Parson you know I'm a poor shot and we just went hunting I can't hit nothing but just look at all the game I have he was so laid him down he could hardly pack his gun with all the Ducks and rabbits and all the things that they had gotten I was just thinking of walking along after such a successful day hunting with all the things that we got I can hardly walk he must love me there must be something that this great God you keep talking about he must love me if he would care enough to give me that if we would only come to a place that the Holy Ghost would open our eyes to God's goodness to us it would bring repentance if we could only get our eyes open but it's become a common thing now remember that you don't see God but God seeks you and if you're here tonight God seeks you not the other way around if you've set out on a journey trying to find God it's because God's pricked your heart and he's pulling you in little by little sometimes it takes a while remember crucifixion was a slow death it took a lot of time to come around to a place of death one final story there was a story of a man looking for a new farm he was a farmer he was looking for a farm and he saw a land go up for sale a hundred acres of Farmland the best deal you've ever seen 100 acres of farmland and that farmer went out and he went to the second farmer and he looked to see what this land was about it was a hundred acres of beautiful farmland and he came up to the second Farmer and the farmer says I'll make you a deal sir I have these hundred acres of land but what I want to do is I want to sell you the 99 Acres that all 99 of them I just want to keep the one in the middle it has a special family significance to me my grandfather owned it my father owned it I want I own it now and I just want I'll sell you everything but there's just this one little piece in the middle I want to keep that I just want to keep that it just means something to me but I'll give you a deal you can't refuse I'll give you a price you can't turn down and the man the man said well he asked what the price was he told him the price and his eyes bugged down he said well I can't I have to take it and he took it and he began to farm those 99 Acres minus one and they began to farm it but there was an instant problem because every week that farmer that old farmer went to visit that one acre right in the middle of his land and he had to drive his tractor down the middle of the road and tear down all these 99 Acres as he drove across that plot of land tearing up in mud and dirt and everything to get to that little piece that that other man wouldn't fully buy out and I wonder sometimes if we don't leave a final acre of our heart undone and we say oh it was my grandfather and my father and something this and it just means something and and the devil we allow the devil to have one little piece of one little piece of something and we won't fully sell out and the devil's able to drive over our life because there's that one piece that he still owns but there's a time to sell out the final acre every part of our hearts brother
