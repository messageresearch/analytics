[1:14:16] is in the Youth of the message I will
[1:14:19] just say this message is in good hands

[1:14:47] the gift he's bestowed on our brother
[1:14:49] Ron
[1:14:50] not just the gift but the heart the Zeal
[1:14:54] the passion the love the example that we
[1:14:59] can all identify with
[1:15:01] and I want to just say I do not take
[1:15:04] this lightly
[1:15:06] this is not just a regular thing while
[1:15:08] brother Ron's going to come and no this
[1:15:11] this was
[1:15:12] the Lord Jesus extending himself through
[1:15:16] this couple to us and brother thank you

[1:15:34] we're going to hear
[1:15:36] from a brother that is a general is
[1:15:41] I think of
[1:15:43] of
[1:15:44] somebody who can address us
[1:15:47] from a perspective very few can
[1:15:50] and I will say
[1:15:53] we if The Minister's meeting was an
[1:15:56] indication

[1:26:20] we get our change
[1:26:21] [Applause]
[1:26:23] Hallelujah and he speak with him in the
[1:26:26] parable behold the Fig Tree and all the
[1:26:31] trees fig tree is Israel all the trees
[1:26:35] brother Benham says was a World Council
[1:26:37] of churches and United Nations
[1:26:41] and when they shall shoot forth
[1:26:44] see no of your own selves that summer
[1:26:48] is now nigh at hand
[1:26:51] so likewise
[1:26:53] when you see these things come to pass
[1:26:55] know ye that the kingdom of God is an
[1:27:00] eye at hand that's not speaking about
[1:27:02] the kingdom of God within you that's
[1:27:04] talking about the kingdom set on Earth
[1:27:08] and merely I send you this generation
[1:27:12] shall not pass away
[1:27:14] till all be fulfilled
[1:27:16] Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my
[1:27:19] words shall not pass away
[1:27:22] one more scripture please Matthew 24
[1:27:27] verse 1.
[1:27:30] this is where I'm drawing my subject
[1:27:32] this morning
[1:27:36] foreign
[1:27:46] verse 1 please
[1:27:48] and Jesus went out
[1:27:50] and departed from the temple
[1:27:54] and his disciples came to him for show
[1:27:56] him the building of the Temple
[1:28:00] and Jesus said unto them see not all
[1:28:03] these things
[1:28:05] verily I sent to you there shall not be
[1:28:08] one stone upon another
[1:28:11] that shall be thrown down
[1:28:14] and as he said upon the Mount of Olives
[1:28:17] the disciples came unto him privately
[1:28:20] saying
[1:28:22] just to look at it he's coming privately
[1:28:26] sounds like the seventh seal
[1:28:32] saying tell us
[1:28:34] When shall these things be
[1:28:37] and what shall be the sign of thy coming
[1:28:42] and of the end of the world
[1:28:46] I want to dwell on those two things
[1:28:48] the sign of thy coming
[1:28:51] and the end of the world sign I want to
[1:28:54] put it as the end of the world sign
[1:28:57] God bless you as you may be seated
[1:29:08] I probably do I trust it's okay
[1:29:14] but I'll probably be reading quite a few
[1:29:16] quotes we'll just see as the Lord leads
[1:29:18] but I want to start out with this one
[1:29:20] from crisis to mystery
[1:29:23] he said no God had a purpose
[1:29:27] in the hidden Mystery
[1:29:29] and that's what I want to speak on to
[1:29:31] the church this morning
[1:29:34] the hidden Mystery of God that he had in
[1:29:37] his mind before the world ever began
[1:29:42] and how it's unfolded itself right down
[1:29:44] to the present hour that we're living
[1:29:49] then you will understand clearly listen
[1:29:51] to this now then you will understand
[1:29:54] clearly I believe what is being done
[1:30:00] God's great mystery
[1:30:03] it's a secret
[1:30:06] it's kept he kept it a secret
[1:30:10] nobody knowed about it
[1:30:13] even the angels didn't understand it
[1:30:17] think about it even the angels
[1:30:20] didn't understand it
[1:30:23] it's a secret
[1:30:25] my are you a blessed people
[1:30:30] I'm telling you we're blessed people
[1:30:32] because not even the angels know
[1:30:36] what was coming forth
[1:30:39] but you're sitting here this morning
[1:30:41] because of restored word
[1:30:46] and you are catching a secret
[1:30:50] that was in the back part of God's mind
[1:30:53] [Applause]
[1:30:56] brother if you could please keep the
[1:30:57] monetary up just a little bit more not
[1:30:59] not a lot but just a little please amen
[1:31:02] so I I want to uh
[1:31:06] say something this morning that
[1:31:10] uh
[1:31:13] Paul when he was speaking in the
[1:31:15] Corinthian Church
[1:31:17] in the first chapter of Corinthians if
[1:31:21] you have a Scofield bible
[1:31:23] and uh
[1:31:25] and Schofield of course we don't take
[1:31:27] all of his footnotes but I thought this
[1:31:30] really compared with the with the
[1:31:32] message that uh and and it speaks about
[1:31:37] uh there's three Greek words
[1:31:40] that pertain to his coming
[1:31:42] and the first one and I know it's a
[1:31:45] little scary now because what happened
[1:31:47] in the message but it's actually a
[1:31:49] parasia
[1:31:50] which is his personal presence
[1:31:54] very simple
[1:31:56] his personal presence
[1:32:00] amen and then the second one is
[1:32:04] apocalypse which we are very familiar
[1:32:07] with Beyond failing unveiling of the
[1:32:11] word or revelation
[1:32:14] then the third word is epiphania no I'm
[1:32:18] not a Greek scholar so amen which
[1:32:22] represents the manifestation of that
[1:32:26] revelation
[1:32:29] can a hearing amen
[1:32:32] so we see this morning that amen their
[1:32:35] takes
[1:32:36] a great Revelation to understand who you
[1:32:40] are
[1:32:42] and his personal presence is more than
[1:32:45] just a feeling
[1:32:50] let me share with the prophet of God
[1:32:52] said
[1:32:53] he sent my Ministry
[1:32:56] my Ministry is a different Ministry from
[1:33:00] a pastor or a teacher
[1:33:04] he said my Ministry is to declare that
[1:33:09] he is here
[1:33:10] [Applause]
[1:33:15] Hallelujah
[1:33:17] he is here
[1:33:19] [Applause]
[1:33:20] he's not just coming he's here
[1:33:25] [Music]
[1:33:28] and the ministry proved it by more than
[1:33:31] just saying he's here
[1:33:33] [Applause]
[1:33:35] it's the same with brother wrong
[1:33:37] Ministry the other night I felt the
[1:33:40] presence
[1:33:42] standing right here
[1:33:44] [Applause]
[1:33:46] and you saw what happened
[1:33:49] it was his personal presence brother I'm
[1:33:53] still laboring a little bit please if
[1:33:54] you can give me a little more sorry
[1:33:56] about that
[1:33:58] so we uh I want to so I'd rather read
[1:34:01] quotes
[1:34:03] I mean we're message Believers right
[1:34:07] I'm not an evangelist uh you know and I
[1:34:09] just have to be what I am as a you know
[1:34:12] oh incidentally I forgot to to greet you
[1:34:16] from our true word Tabernacle and our
[1:34:20] our pastor brother Wayne Lawson I I'm
[1:34:23] I'm the senior now
[1:34:28] whoa I'm that senior pastor I guess when
[1:34:31] you're 84 you can be
[1:34:35] this is one quote this is absolutely
[1:34:38] astounding to me
[1:34:40] it comes from I believe from the seed of
[1:34:42] discrepancy
[1:34:44] the word
[1:34:46] becoming alive in our own flesh
[1:34:50] that shows the presence of God
[1:34:56] so uh we are sitting in the presence of
[1:35:01] God because his presence his Revelation
[1:35:04] his calling his seed his germ is in you
[1:35:09] and I
[1:35:10] [Applause]
[1:35:14] is that okay
[1:35:16] amen that's not false Doctrine that's
[1:35:18] real
[1:35:20] that he's alive in this bride today
[1:35:27] it's changed
[1:35:30] from the prophet
[1:35:32] to the prophecy
[1:35:35] and we are living out the prophecy
[1:35:39] of the Bride of Jesus Christ we're not
[1:35:42] living out Luther's day Wesley's day
[1:35:45] Pentecost we absolutely
[1:35:48] living out the coming of the Lord
[1:35:52] [Applause]
[1:36:01] we have to recognize this morning
[1:36:05] there's a bride coming
[1:36:08] and the son of man has been waved over
[1:36:12] the church again
[1:36:15] in the full maturity of the word in its
[1:36:19] full of power
[1:36:20] [Applause]
[1:36:22] he believed that
[1:36:24] so we must come in order to be in the
[1:36:27] rapture we must come to a mature bride
[1:36:32] we are not Pentecostal babies
[1:36:34] [Applause]
[1:36:36] amen we must come to the revelation
[1:36:39] absolutely that we are the
[1:36:42] representation
[1:36:44] of Jesus Christ on Earth
[1:36:46] [Applause]
[1:36:52] don't ever forget
[1:36:55] Who You Are
[1:36:58] you're more than son or a daughter of an
[1:37:01] Earthly parent
[1:37:03] but you got a Heavenly parents
[1:37:10] Hallelujah
[1:37:13] so there's another quote
[1:37:17] the presence of God unrecognized
[1:37:20] he said we could only realize
[1:37:24] that is appearing to us in these
[1:37:27] meetings
[1:37:28] for one purpose
[1:37:31] that's to release our desires that we
[1:37:35] have in him to us
[1:37:38] but we got to recognize his presence
[1:37:43] and now how do you recognize his
[1:37:46] presence is when the promised word for
[1:37:50] this age is made manifested
[1:37:58] you look at Psalms chapter 1 verse I
[1:38:01] believe it's seven
[1:38:04] it's his fruit
[1:38:06] in his season
[1:38:09] it's his fruit in his season
[1:38:13] so we are at the season of the change of
[1:38:18] our bodies
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:23] I want to notify you
[1:38:25] you got the Holy Ghost
[1:38:28] [Applause]
[1:38:28] [Music]
[1:38:31] the Rapture is already in you
[1:38:38] Hallelujah
[1:38:40] if you oh Glory
[1:38:43] if you got the Holy Ghost the Rapture
[1:38:47] the rapture
[1:38:49] healing the difference the joy the peace
[1:38:54] [Applause]
[1:38:58] hallelujah
[1:39:00] it's already in you
[1:39:02] [Applause]
[1:39:04] it's not going to come his hands arrived
[1:39:08] whoa
[1:39:16] [Applause]
[1:39:19] I got I got a scripture for that
[1:39:23] in case you say well back it up and
[1:39:25] about I can
[1:39:27] it's Romans 8.
[1:39:29] verse 30.
[1:39:31] [Applause]
[1:39:32] when you're predestinated if you're
[1:39:34] predestinated
[1:39:36] in whom is predestinated
[1:39:39] they are called
[1:39:41] [Applause]
[1:39:45] and when you're called
[1:39:47] you are Justified
[1:39:51] and when you adjust the whole glory and
[1:39:54] when you're Justified you are already
[1:39:56] gone as high
[1:40:00] let's get my praise offering
[1:40:03] come on let's get my face off
[1:40:07] come on let's give them a place
[1:40:09] come on let's give him a praise offered
[1:40:17] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:40:29] Blessed Be His holy name
[1:40:31] [Applause]
[1:40:34] I want to share something with you
[1:40:39] because
[1:40:41] the revelation of the revelation of the
[1:40:44] or I mean the Rapture I'm sorry is a
[1:40:48] revelation
[1:40:49] [Applause]
[1:40:52] the new birth is a revelation of Jesus
[1:40:57] Christ personally to you
[1:41:00] so if he could give you a revelation of
[1:41:04] the new birth personally
[1:41:06] can he not also give you the revelation
[1:41:08] of the rapture
[1:41:10] [Applause]
[1:41:13] that kind of got fresh
[1:41:15] [Applause]
[1:41:19] absolutely if we can rest in it
[1:41:22] [Applause]
[1:41:25] if we can rest in it
[1:41:27] now brother bam says it's going to take
[1:41:29] more faith
[1:41:31] in this age
[1:41:32] than there's ever been
[1:41:35] but because he's going to take more
[1:41:37] faith how does faith come by hearing
[1:41:43] so don't worry the little flock
[1:41:47] he gave us more word
[1:41:50] he gave us the Original Seed
[1:41:54] and when you give this The Original Seed
[1:41:57] he'll give us original faith
[1:41:59] [Applause]
[1:42:03] so brother random said don't worry it'll
[1:42:06] be there
[1:42:10] [Applause]
[1:42:13] Hallelujah
[1:42:15] so when we see now folks
[1:42:19] how close we're Nearing
[1:42:22] our Exodus
[1:42:26] remember the first Exodus
[1:42:29] was going from a natural land
[1:42:31] to another natural land
[1:42:35] second Exodus
[1:42:37] going from a spiritual condition
[1:42:40] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:44] the Third Exodus is going from the
[1:42:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost taking us into
[1:42:50] the Millennium and the great hereafter
[1:42:53] [Applause]
[1:42:56] so did he not perform the first one
[1:43:00] and the second one
[1:43:02] and the one that descended for us will
[1:43:05] do the third one
[1:43:06] [Applause]
[1:43:15] we're just talking in the back room you
[1:43:17] know that brother Ron brought up about
[1:43:19] you know uh you know we're not Canadians
[1:43:23] we're not Americans
[1:43:26] some are loud some are soft
[1:43:29] but you're fun to preach for
[1:43:41] and I can tell you where none of those
[1:43:44] were a kingdom of God
[1:43:49] Hallelujah and I tell you what brother
[1:43:51] Madam said there's a one place you go to
[1:43:54] heaven you'll be shouting and praising
[1:43:56] the Lord you go to hell you'll be
[1:43:57] gnashing your teeth it's the quietest
[1:44:00] place you'll ever be
[1:44:04] so wherever Jesus is this noise
[1:44:06] [Applause]
[1:44:11] I know some of you might get nervous of
[1:44:13] that but
[1:44:18] now I wanted to slow up a little bit
[1:44:20] here
[1:44:21] I got a lot on my mind but uh we only
[1:44:25] got much so much time
[1:44:26] but you know when you look at it
[1:44:31] in order for us to have a millennium
[1:44:35] there has to be a cleansing of this
[1:44:37] Earth
[1:44:41] Brother Band talks in the future home
[1:44:42] about the Redemption plan for a human
[1:44:45] and the Redemption plan for an earth
[1:44:51] so when I
[1:44:53] remember I'm speaking about the signs of
[1:44:56] his coming
[1:44:58] in the sign of the end
[1:45:02] our sign is not what's all going on out
[1:45:06] here
[1:45:07] but it's a part of the modern events
[1:45:10] made clear by prophecy
[1:45:13] you following me
[1:45:16] our sign was a resurrection sign
[1:45:24] absolutely he showed himself
[1:45:28] through a little Kentuckian
[1:45:32] in order to have the coming of the lord
[1:45:34] we had to have a Ministry
[1:45:37] that would be like that Ministry
[1:45:41] but brother Benham said he had more
[1:45:43] success
[1:45:45] he had lost success in my Ministry than
[1:45:49] he even had in his
[1:45:54] you got quiet on him that's a quote
[1:45:57] he's not saying I did it is saying he
[1:46:03] it's not rather Ron Spencer that does
[1:46:07] these things it's he
[1:46:09] [Applause]
[1:46:12] it's not brother Ed that does these
[1:46:15] things it's he
[1:46:18] it's not me it's not you it's he
[1:46:21] [Applause]
[1:46:28] let me read here from the so when we see
[1:46:31] here from the seventh seal
[1:46:34] brother Ben was talking about the coming
[1:46:36] of the Lord
[1:46:38] and I'll just add do some paraphrase in
[1:46:41] here but you'll see here that he's
[1:46:43] looking at this
[1:46:45] this secret coming
[1:46:47] and he said one thing about it Satan
[1:46:50] does not understand this
[1:46:55] he said he can be mimic
[1:46:58] verse Paul
[1:46:59] second Paul
[1:47:01] but the third poll
[1:47:03] [Applause]
[1:47:05] the third poll is a secret
[1:47:09] that the devil
[1:47:11] will never get it
[1:47:12] [Applause]
[1:47:16] and then he said in Christ there's a
[1:47:18] mystery page 58.
[1:47:21] he said this hidden Mystery
[1:47:24] the seven seal this coming of the Lord
[1:47:28] is in the heart
[1:47:31] it's in the heart of the believer
[1:47:35] [Applause]
[1:47:41] someone that's in the heart of the
[1:47:43] believer
[1:47:44] it's slowly changing us
[1:47:47] [Applause]
[1:47:49] from Glory
[1:47:50] to glory to glory to glory
[1:47:56] [Applause]
[1:47:57] until we're in glory
[1:48:00] [Applause]
[1:48:08] oh yeah
[1:48:11] I say Glory
[1:48:13] [Applause]
[1:48:18] if I can quote here from the seventh
[1:48:20] seal
[1:48:20] he said but remember in that part I'm
[1:48:23] going to a different part of the seven
[1:48:24] seal but in that part
[1:48:27] he's saying now
[1:48:29] the signs will also show it
[1:48:33] the signs will also short
[1:48:36] in paragraph 231 of the seventh seal now
[1:48:39] remember
[1:48:40] this seven seal is the end of time
[1:48:44] it's the end of all things
[1:48:47] the things written in the sentence seal
[1:48:49] books seal up of the Plan of Redemption
[1:48:52] from before the foundation of the world
[1:48:54] it every bit ends
[1:48:58] It's The End
[1:49:00] of struggling world
[1:49:02] [Music]
[1:49:04] it's the end of struggling nature
[1:49:09] it's the end of everything
[1:49:11] [Applause]
[1:49:12] it's even the end of the trumpets
[1:49:15] it's the end of the vials
[1:49:18] you know I want to just
[1:49:20] show you there
[1:49:23] in the vials
[1:49:25] revelation 16.
[1:49:27] you say brother Mann never got a chance
[1:49:29] to preach on it no I know he wanted to
[1:49:31] preach on it
[1:49:32] but if you study the scriptures and you
[1:49:35] study the message you see he did preach
[1:49:38] on it
[1:49:43] because if you read all of those vials
[1:49:45] listen if there's a church age there has
[1:49:47] to be a vial
[1:49:49] there has to be a judgment
[1:49:52] right so if you read that scripture I
[1:49:56] believe if I'm writing in Revelation 16
[1:49:58] of the last verse that's taken them
[1:50:00] because of those vials is taken into the
[1:50:04] Armageddon
[1:50:06] are you following me
[1:50:09] so amen there is there is two cleansings
[1:50:14] there has to be a cleansing for the
[1:50:16] millennium
[1:50:17] [Applause]
[1:50:19] and there has to be after Satan is
[1:50:21] loosed for a season
[1:50:24] there's another cleansing
[1:50:26] I believe and I could be wrong but I
[1:50:29] don't believe so the first cleansing
[1:50:30] will be atomic fire
[1:50:33] [Music]
[1:50:34] [Applause]
[1:50:35] that cleanses sir the other one will be
[1:50:37] Heavenly Fire
[1:50:43] so listen if you want a millennium to
[1:50:46] Reign him
[1:50:48] you got to realize God has got to purify
[1:50:51] this Earth
[1:50:56] and brother Brandon was seen here even
[1:50:58] it's the end of the vials and it's even
[1:51:01] the ushering in of the millennium
[1:51:05] is that true
[1:51:07] now if you go
[1:51:09] to Revelation chapter seven please if
[1:51:11] you have your Bibles or if you don't
[1:51:14] just
[1:51:16] um I'm sure they'll have it on the
[1:51:17] screen
[1:51:20] foreign
[1:51:29] and after these things
[1:51:32] I saw four Angels standing
[1:51:36] on the four corners of the Earth
[1:51:39] holding the Four Winds of the Earth
[1:51:43] yet the wind should not blow on the
[1:51:45] earth no on the sea nor on any tree
[1:51:48] who's in control
[1:51:54] Russia thinks they're in control America
[1:51:56] thinks you're in control God's in
[1:51:58] control
[1:52:04] and I saw another Angel ascending from
[1:52:06] the East
[1:52:07] having the Seal of the Living God
[1:52:10] and he cried with a loud voice to the
[1:52:12] four angels to whom it was given to hurt
[1:52:15] the earth and the sea
[1:52:20] remember now
[1:52:22] those winds are war or strife
[1:52:28] saying hurt not the Earth
[1:52:30] neither the sea nor the trees that we
[1:52:35] have seal the Servants of God in their
[1:52:38] foreheads
[1:52:40] that's not Gentiles that's Jews
[1:52:45] so you realize amen it's not that we're
[1:52:49] we're worried about the Earth blowing up
[1:52:52] or burning up
[1:52:54] the bride has an exodus
[1:53:00] the bride does not have to go through
[1:53:03] judgment
[1:53:04] or tribulation
[1:53:06] he's already been judged
[1:53:07] [Applause]
[1:53:11] in fact
[1:53:13] her judge is also the jury
[1:53:19] and the jury and the judge worked
[1:53:21] together
[1:53:24] and declared this bride is not guilty
[1:53:29] [Applause]
[1:53:32] Hallelujah
[1:53:34] you had your Jubilee
[1:53:37] you're not a slave anymore
[1:53:39] [Applause]
[1:53:40] [Music]
[1:53:44] you can have listen you can walk without
[1:53:46] condemnation
[1:53:49] because you are in Christ
[1:53:55] [Applause]
[1:53:59] [Music]
[1:54:01] said all right if I do a little bit of
[1:54:03] our reading I've got some things I just
[1:54:05] on the heart
[1:54:07] amen I just got something in my heart
[1:54:10] amen
[1:54:11] in Christ there's a mystery of God
[1:54:12] revealed
[1:54:15] he said then we can see
[1:54:18] that the marriage suffers at hand
[1:54:20] [Applause]
[1:54:22] not if I never see you again remember
[1:54:25] the marriage suppers at hand
[1:54:29] and then the kingdom
[1:54:31] according to the promise is ready to be
[1:54:35] issued in
[1:54:37] God I got a little bit ahead of myself
[1:54:39] there but in Christ there's a mystery
[1:54:41] there's a three-fold
[1:54:43] manner of his coming
[1:54:45] the first was in Christ
[1:54:48] the second
[1:54:50] I'd like to read it because it it I
[1:54:52] can't remember the words in Christ the
[1:54:54] second one is the preeminence in The
[1:54:57] Bride of Jesus Christ in other words
[1:55:00] he's looking not only for those that are
[1:55:03] learners
[1:55:06] but the manifestation
[1:55:09] [Music]
[1:55:10] the epiphania
[1:55:13] not just the revelation
[1:55:17] [Applause]
[1:55:18] and the third one is the kingdom to be
[1:55:22] set up here on Earth
[1:55:24] whoa
[1:55:27] you know what
[1:55:29] don't worry what place you got he's got
[1:55:32] one for you

[1:55:59] your favorite Airlines
[1:56:01] better be United right Brian
[1:56:05] they don't hold a candle to this
[1:56:08] or Delta
[1:56:16] he said now then the kingdom according
[1:56:18] to the promise already be issued in the
[1:56:21] great millennium
[1:56:23] taken up of the church
[1:56:25] and the destroying of the wicked
[1:56:28] the world under the Sixth Seal remember
[1:56:30] that's the Judgment seal to be purified
[1:56:33] by volcanic take all the corruption the
[1:56:37] sin of the world
[1:56:38] and to mold her out again and bring
[1:56:41] forth a new millennium for the age that
[1:56:43] is to come
[1:56:45] and when we see all these three full
[1:56:48] revelation God in Christ Christ in the
[1:56:52] church
[1:56:53] the kingdom coming Adam and Eve redeemed
[1:56:57] back to the Garden of Eden in the
[1:56:59] representation of Christ and the bride
[1:57:01] then the kingdom is going to be restored
[1:57:04] again to his promise
[1:57:13] you remember in Revelations there's
[1:57:15] three wolves
[1:57:18] first of all
[1:57:20] was the first World War
[1:57:23] I'm trying to show you something
[1:57:25] that this Earth is going to be the way
[1:57:27] it is until he calls for it
[1:57:32] as long as he's got seed here
[1:57:37] as long as she's got Sons and Daughters
[1:57:39] to come yet
[1:57:42] every one of his seeds must be on
[1:57:45] display
[1:57:48] [Music]
[1:57:49] he's incomplete
[1:57:52] that sounds crazy but he's incomplete
[1:57:55] without everyone of his attributes
[1:58:05] and you never have to worry about
[1:58:07] somebody taking your place
[1:58:10] [Applause]
[1:58:14] brother minnow and even at our age we
[1:58:18] got it made
[1:58:21] if we go before or come after
[1:58:24] we'll be there
[1:58:29] don't tell us that we're 80s
[1:58:33] inside is an 18 year old
[1:58:44] brother men will give me a hit thumbs up
[1:58:51] president was talking about this first
[1:58:52] World War
[1:58:54] holding back the Four Winds
[1:58:59] it ended on the 11th month
[1:59:02] lemon tea
[1:59:04] 11th Hour something supernaturally
[1:59:08] took place
[1:59:13] that war was from
[1:59:15] 1914 to 1918.
[1:59:20] second world war second war
[1:59:24] the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and
[1:59:27] Nagasaki
[1:59:29] 416
[1:59:31] 800 soldiers
[1:59:33] died
[1:59:36] 1906 to 1909 was Azusa Street Revival
[1:59:41] brother Branham was born April 6 1909
[1:59:45] that's correct isn't it I believe yes
[1:59:50] it's just been one thing there's wars
[1:59:53] and rumors of wars
[1:59:56] you remember in Matthew 24 all seven
[1:59:59] seals are listed in there
[2:00:03] foreign
[2:00:04] all seven seals are listed in Matthew
[2:00:06] 24.
[2:00:09] amen so the the Clock Was ticking
[2:00:13] what was it brother Benham said I forget
[2:00:15] was it 12 minutes before midnight
[2:00:17] something like that I just heard about
[2:00:19] two or three four months back somebody
[2:00:21] said it's nine seconds
[2:00:25] before midnight
[2:00:27] nine seconds
[2:00:31] think about this
[2:00:33] in the 60s I didn't get the the year
[2:00:36] right I think it's 1962.
[2:00:39] the Cuban crisis the missile crisis
[2:00:43] took place
[2:00:44] 35-day standoff
[2:00:48] Mr Kennedy was the president of the
[2:00:51] United States
[2:00:52] nuclear missile sites were built in Cuba
[2:00:56] by the Soviet Union
[2:00:59] it was that close even as a young boy
[2:01:02] it's a young man I didn't realize how
[2:01:05] close it was
[2:01:08] to the missiles
[2:01:11] being sent on towards North America
[2:01:15] but the Four Winds
[2:01:18] the angel is still here
[2:01:22] the bride is still here
[2:01:27] you don't realize how important you are
[2:01:30] to the kingdom
[2:01:32] [Applause]
[2:01:34] you don't realize how important you are
[2:01:37] even to the unbeliever
[2:01:41] because it gives them a little more time
[2:01:46] to repent
[2:01:48] [Applause]
[2:01:50] praise the Lord
[2:01:52] [Applause]
[2:01:57] I read well it'll only take 30 minutes
[2:02:00] for a Miss of the fly between Russia and
[2:02:04] the United States
[2:02:07] from a submarine
[2:02:09] 10 to 15 minutes
[2:02:12] to Launch
[2:02:14] and be at his destination
[2:02:17] I want to show you something
[2:02:19] not that you don't know it
[2:02:22] but this Earth is in birth pains
[2:02:27] it's no time to play Church
[2:02:30] it's no time to get your lines Tangled
[2:02:34] time to say God if there's anything
[2:02:37] wrong with me
[2:02:38] [Applause]
[2:02:40] take it out reveal it to me
[2:02:45] remember this Rapture is not taking the
[2:02:47] world
[2:02:49] we can't be half believer and half
[2:02:52] unbeliever
[2:03:01] remember the seven Visions I'm not going
[2:03:03] to go all through them
[2:03:06] but the sixth one
[2:03:10] just imagine how that was made manifest
[2:03:15] where
[2:03:17] a vice president
[2:03:20] was brought into the vote
[2:03:23] and became vice president
[2:03:26] a woman
[2:03:28] a woman
[2:03:30] with brother Ben and Saul
[2:03:32] I don't want to go I don't have time to
[2:03:34] go through all of them one of them says
[2:03:36] watch Russia watch Russia keep an eye on
[2:03:40] the North you realize when brother bam
[2:03:42] said to Russia going down for the oil
[2:03:44] you know they're in oil country right
[2:03:46] now they even have oil but they're in
[2:03:48] oil country right now
[2:03:50] do you realize in Syria
[2:03:53] we have Russia
[2:03:55] America
[2:03:57] and are telling how many other
[2:03:59] Nations
[2:04:03] so we see here that everything and he
[2:04:06] said the last in seven Vision I heard
[2:04:09] the most terrible explosion as I turned
[2:04:12] a look I saw nothing but degree in
[2:04:16] craters and smoke
[2:04:18] all over the place
[2:04:23] speaking about vials
[2:04:25] speaking about ungodly things
[2:04:29] brother men said in leadership
[2:04:31] he said oh God
[2:04:34] let me go don't don't let me go don't
[2:04:37] don't leave me behind Jesus
[2:04:41] let me go with you father
[2:04:45] I don't want to stay here on this Earth
[2:04:47] to watch all these tribulations come on
[2:04:49] I don't want to stay here for this
[2:04:51] insanity
[2:04:54] right right you mean he was calling that
[2:04:57] Insanity then what have we got now
[2:05:01] when you call good bad and bad good
[2:05:06] don't even know what gender
[2:05:10] I don't want to get into all these
[2:05:12] things but I tell you we are seen
[2:05:14] Insanity like we've never seen it
[2:05:21] but you know what that means
[2:05:23] we're not going down folks
[2:05:26] we're ready to go up
[2:05:27] [Applause]
[2:05:36] he said it
[2:05:38] they'll go so insane until locusts raise
[2:05:42] up like women to the hunt to women
[2:05:44] that's Revelations also mental condition
[2:05:47] of people will be completely gone
[2:05:51] we see it making it right now
[2:05:55] right now
[2:06:04] in 1962 brother Benham was relating to
[2:06:07] something
[2:06:09] in the spoken word is the Original Seed
[2:06:14] and he said there was three seeds
[2:06:17] planted you remember that
[2:06:19] three seeds planted
[2:06:24] he said there was a denominational seed
[2:06:26] by Billy Graham
[2:06:29] and then there was a Pentecostal seed
[2:06:31] planted by Oral Roberts
[2:06:35] but then there was a word seed
[2:06:40] that had been planted
[2:06:43] a word said
[2:06:46] now if you understand he said folks
[2:06:49] and say there's no more or less God
[2:06:51] tells me I want you to get this good and
[2:06:53] clear three seeds has been planted
[2:07:00] he talks about a Mariah rain teaching
[2:07:03] rain he talks about a harvest rain
[2:07:08] he said Billy Graham has struck the
[2:07:10] world
[2:07:11] Pentecostals have struck the world and
[2:07:14] the word has struck the world
[2:07:21] right
[2:07:22] so he said now
[2:07:27] then the kind of seed
[2:07:29] you plant it in your field will be the
[2:07:33] kind of crop you will reap
[2:07:41] so it's important as we as ministers
[2:07:45] plant the right seed
[2:07:47] [Applause]
[2:07:52] is that true
[2:07:55] now brother man was saying it's dying
[2:07:57] down it's dying down 1962.
[2:08:01] it's dying down already the seed has
[2:08:04] been planted but wait a while hang on a
[2:08:05] minute
[2:08:08] he said in the message in 1962 in the
[2:08:11] present stage of our man Ministry
[2:08:15] you know he quoted out of second Timothy
[2:08:18] chapter four
[2:08:20] as Paul was speaking demons hath
[2:08:22] forsaken me
[2:08:25] [Applause]
[2:08:26] and it looked like Paul had lost his
[2:08:29] power
[2:08:31] when he give away his cloak
[2:08:33] and they're trying to run them out of
[2:08:35] town
[2:08:36] are you all with me
[2:08:38] I know you're maybe a little tired but
[2:08:40] may you get the quickening power
[2:08:45] so brother abandonment saying
[2:08:49] they're saying that I'm washed up
[2:08:54] but he wasn't washed up
[2:08:57] he was far from being washed up
[2:09:00] there was time oh Lord it was time now
[2:09:04] he's going to be stepping into his new
[2:09:07] ministry
[2:09:13] and in order to have a matured seed
[2:09:19] they're after him step into the third
[2:09:21] pole
[2:09:22] [Applause]
[2:09:25] and that third poll was the opening of
[2:09:28] the workers
[2:09:30] [Music]
[2:09:33] and even though he had a Moses Ministry
[2:09:36] and he Delights the ministry he needed a
[2:09:39] Joshua Ministry
[2:09:40] [Applause]
[2:09:43] is that right
[2:09:45] whole glory to God
[2:09:47] [Applause]
[2:09:48] eat from his listen
[2:09:50] Timothy you time now second Timothy
[2:09:53] chapter four it says do the work of an
[2:09:55] evangelist
[2:09:58] it didn't mean that Paul was an
[2:09:59] evangelist didn't mean brother Ben was
[2:10:01] the Evangelist do the work of
[2:10:03] evangelists
[2:10:04] [Applause]
[2:10:06] so what was it doing it was pulling the
[2:10:09] seed
[2:10:11] but it wasn't maturing the seed
[2:10:15] it was fully deceived but it wasn't
[2:10:18] mature in the seed
[2:10:20] [Music]
[2:10:21] say praise the Lord
[2:10:24] so there had to be that brother Branham
[2:10:27] or remember what he said there
[2:10:29] he said I trust the Lord will help me
[2:10:32] take this word
[2:10:34] and clothe the bride
[2:10:38] [Applause]
[2:10:42] take this word
[2:10:44] and clothe the bride
[2:10:47] I thought he already had the word
[2:10:52] B did have
[2:10:54] but there had to be
[2:10:56] a opening
[2:10:59] [Music]
[2:11:02] you know why you see his coming
[2:11:05] it's right in the message the rising of
[2:11:07] its son of son I can't read all these
[2:11:09] quotes they're so beautiful that's why I
[2:11:11] like to just lay it out the way he tells
[2:11:13] it amen man I'm going to tell you what
[2:11:14] he said the quickening power let you see
[2:11:17] his coming
[2:11:18] [Applause]
[2:11:23] is that right
[2:11:25] do you see us coming
[2:11:27] and you got the quickening power
[2:11:31] and he can Cricket every promise
[2:11:35] [Applause]
[2:11:39] listen people don't get a denominational
[2:11:42] understanding of the coming
[2:11:44] [Applause]
[2:11:45] there's no mystery to that
[2:11:49] where they're going to be flying out of
[2:11:50] airplanes and jumping out of cars
[2:11:53] it's a secret
[2:12:01] now brother Ray
[2:12:04] oh two rays on the scene
[2:12:08] Brother Ray you tell your wife things
[2:12:10] you never told somebody else
[2:12:13] yeah
[2:12:15] brother brother Ron you tell sister
[2:12:18] Connie you'd never tell somebody else
[2:12:22] that's the same with our Christ
[2:12:28] [Applause]
[2:12:32] I tell you what
[2:12:33] [Applause]
[2:12:35] he took his love secrets
[2:12:38] that he had before the foundation of the
[2:12:41] world
[2:12:42] and even this morning he's whispering
[2:12:46] even this morning he's whispering
[2:12:50] his love secrets

[2:13:14] and because you're his wife
[2:13:17] he'll never keep one Revelation from you
[2:13:22] [Applause]
[2:13:25] brother random said he didn't whisper to
[2:13:27] the flirters
[2:13:28] [Applause]
[2:13:30] he whispered to his sons and daughters
[2:13:33] [Applause]
[2:13:37] I tell you what if you're down in your
[2:13:39] spirit this morning may God lift you up

[2:14:26] don't ever let it drop from you
[2:14:30] I'm just pausing for a moment here I'm
[2:14:31] trying to see what to do
[2:14:35] but anyway
[2:14:45] let me see if I can find the scripture I
[2:14:47] was looking for something but
[2:14:50] if I can just find it quickly here
[2:14:57] let's turn to Joshua
[2:15:00] Joshua the first chapter
[2:15:11] Joshua the first chapter
[2:15:17] just a couple verses there
[2:15:23] say Amen when you're there
[2:15:26] now after
[2:15:28] the death of Moses
[2:15:31] the sermon of the Lord it came to pass
[2:15:36] that the Lord spoke unto Joshua
[2:15:39] the son of none
[2:15:41] Moses ministers saying

[2:16:29] Moses my sermon is dead but his message
[2:16:32] still lived
[2:16:33] [Applause]
[2:16:36] [Music]
[2:16:38] his message didn't go down Moses my
[2:16:41] servant brother Branham my prophet
[2:16:46] has gone on but his message is not dead
[2:16:49] [Applause]
[2:16:52] in fact
[2:16:55] it's more alive today
[2:16:59] than when the Moses or Elijah was here
[2:17:05] yes sir
[2:17:08] amen it's more alive today
[2:17:12] because he's got a many-membered body
[2:17:16] not just one man
[2:17:21] [Music]
[2:17:30] keep your eyes on that verse two for a
[2:17:32] moment
[2:17:34] Moses my sermon isn't here now therefore
[2:17:36] arise go over Jordan if you look it up
[2:17:39] the word Jordan in the Hebrew it means
[2:17:42] descending
[2:17:46] and
[2:17:48] we had first Thessalonians chapter four
[2:17:51] the Lord himself
[2:17:55] descended with a shout
[2:18:00] so the word Crossing into Jordan means
[2:18:03] Crossing into revelation
[2:18:05] [Applause]
[2:18:08] and at that appearing
[2:18:13] the seven angel had to be on earth at
[2:18:15] the same time right
[2:18:18] so when he tore off that seal
[2:18:22] glory to God he had to have somebody to
[2:18:25] send it down to
[2:18:26] [Applause]
[2:18:28] him and he called a man with him random
[2:18:33] born to a Kentucky hillbilly
[2:18:36] a bootlegger dad
[2:18:40] [Applause]
[2:18:43] that's why I thank God he could
[2:18:46] oh my
[2:18:47] God I could have a chance to be called
[2:18:52] [Music]
[2:18:54] listen you people
[2:18:56] if you can keep your testimony you young
[2:18:58] people keep your testimony
[2:19:02] don't come back with a testimony I got
[2:19:04] off drugs and I got off alcohol I got
[2:19:06] off smoking keep yourself here
[2:19:08] [Applause]
[2:19:11] but I wasn't able to
[2:19:13] I smoked
[2:19:15] I cursed
[2:19:18] I hope they don't stumble somebody me
[2:19:20] preaching
[2:19:21] but God rich in Mercy
[2:19:25] [Applause]
[2:19:27] call me
[2:19:29] and I answered
[2:19:31] [Applause]
[2:19:33] [Music]
[2:19:35] I know what it means to be redeemed
[2:19:38] [Applause]
[2:19:42] to remember Redemption is in two parts
[2:19:46] coming out
[2:19:47] and going in
[2:19:50] and we had to have a Joshua Ministry
[2:19:53] to go in
[2:19:57] let me read a quote please God called
[2:19:59] man am I still open my own time
[2:20:03] he said God is calling men and women
[2:20:05] today
[2:20:06] if I asked him that 20 minutes Lee
[2:20:08] hopefully you'll stay the same
[2:20:12] God has calling men and women today to
[2:20:14] the battlefield
[2:20:16] he's not calling them to a gilgall
[2:20:19] neither is he calling them to a Jericho
[2:20:21] or a Bethel
[2:20:23] but he's calling them the Cross Jordan
[2:20:27] so he can get you out into a school of
[2:20:29] his own power and make you enmold you
[2:20:33] look what he's doing right here now
[2:20:35] sending down the spirit of his son
[2:20:38] he is performing signs and wonders and
[2:20:40] miracles
[2:20:42] which the world hasn't seen the last
[2:20:44] 2000 years
[2:20:46] scientific world has caught the picture
[2:20:48] of it the pillar of fire the angel of
[2:20:50] the Lord
[2:20:51] hangs in Washington D.C tonight
[2:20:54] of the Hall of religious art
[2:20:56] the only supernatural being was ever
[2:20:58] scientifically proven to be photographed
[2:21:00] he puts forth his same signs and wonders
[2:21:04] what is it it's Crossing Jordan
[2:21:08] [Applause]
[2:21:11] is Crossing Jordan
[2:21:15] one Revelation at a time
[2:21:19] when the Revelation at the time
[2:21:22] are you following me
[2:21:25] remember there's two signs for sure
[2:21:29] that the Rapture is getting closer
[2:21:32] and brother Ben said oh if the church
[2:21:35] only knew its position
[2:21:38] if the church only knew its position
[2:21:43] the Rapture would grow
[2:21:47] the Rapture would go another one he is
[2:21:52] saying when you see the headship
[2:21:54] of the body becoming one in the fullness
[2:21:59] of the measure of his manifestation
[2:22:02] that's the epiphania
[2:22:05] manifestation shows that the body is
[2:22:08] about ready to be received to the
[2:22:11] headship
[2:22:15] and then he goes on to the next
[2:22:16] paragraph talking about Israel nations
[2:22:19] are breaking Israel's Awakening
[2:22:26] so you see people
[2:22:29] even Israel today
[2:22:32] it's not necessarily a sign to us
[2:22:35] but it's a sign of the time
[2:22:39] they are surrounded
[2:22:41] by enemies
[2:22:43] and the nation of Iran
[2:22:46] is declaring openly
[2:22:49] we want to destroy that Nation
[2:22:55] I got news for them
[2:22:57] [Applause]
[2:22:57] [Music]
[2:22:59] they haven't read the book that I read
[2:23:03] [Applause]
[2:23:07] and it's the same with you when the oh
[2:23:09] when the Devil comes to you and say you
[2:23:11] ain't going to make it
[2:23:13] you tell that devil you ain't written my
[2:23:16] book
[2:23:16] [Applause]
[2:23:24] why don't we get my praise offering
[2:23:25] again
[2:23:26] [Applause]
[2:23:32] Glory
[2:23:39] because listen all that's in the book is
[2:23:44] him
[2:23:47] and you can't destroy him
[2:23:50] [Applause]
[2:23:57] My Flesh
[2:23:59] I will see God
[2:24:01] [Applause]
[2:24:09] Hallelujah
[2:24:14] you know some days when you wake up
[2:24:17] you might not feel like you're in a
[2:24:19] victory at all
[2:24:21] they got news for you
[2:24:23] you are his victory
[2:24:29] so when the Gloom and the depression try
[2:24:31] to come upon you
[2:24:33] and anxiety
[2:24:36] you just put something on your
[2:24:38] refrigerator you put that cord on the
[2:24:40] refrigerator I am God's victory
[2:24:44] [Applause]
[2:24:48] and tell the devil like Brethren Ron
[2:24:50] tells boo
[2:25:04] brother Ben said in the mirror to
[2:25:06] divorce and I'm not ministering my
[2:25:07] marriage and divorces don't get shook
[2:25:11] and so is it with the church
[2:25:14] well he's talking about I'm sorry you're
[2:25:15] going to back up a little he's actually
[2:25:17] talking about Esther
[2:25:20] now the queen had refused
[2:25:23] the king
[2:25:24] and God chose Esther
[2:25:27] and so is it with the church
[2:25:31] that refuses to become impregnated
[2:25:34] in the age that we now live in
[2:25:37] to bring forth children of this age
[2:25:43] now listen I've been a farmer
[2:25:46] in my young days
[2:25:49] you take
[2:25:51] a wheat field
[2:25:53] we never grew as much wheat in Minnesota
[2:25:55] we did first couple years I farmed I did
[2:25:58] but it seemed like it didn't Thrive
[2:26:00] there
[2:26:01] and when it comes Harvest Time close to
[2:26:03] harvest
[2:26:07] you look over the field
[2:26:12] but you got to do more than just look
[2:26:13] over the field you got to go in the
[2:26:14] field
[2:26:19] and you'll never Harvest that wheat
[2:26:21] until it's all golden grain
[2:26:27] and that's why brother mom said we gotta
[2:26:29] lay in the presence of the Sun
[2:26:33] that's not the s-u-n-s-o-n
[2:26:37] until all the greenness
[2:26:40] all our traditions
[2:26:43] even in the message we got Traditions
[2:26:45] sometimes
[2:26:48] that don't belong in the message it
[2:26:50] never was in the message
[2:26:56] is that right I'm going to tell you all
[2:26:59] the greekness has got to go on out of us
[2:27:05] but we saw
[2:27:07] a matured seed
[2:27:10] in a man called William Branham
[2:27:15] we saw and adopted son of God
[2:27:20] and he's in the field
[2:27:23] [Music]
[2:27:26] so in order to listen if he's in the
[2:27:29] well of course I appreciate what is a
[2:27:32] year ago two years ago Nathan I don't
[2:27:34] know I preached in the Homeland
[2:27:37] it wasn't just about Israel but the man
[2:27:39] said our homeland is the message
[2:27:43] come on if you're wondering away and
[2:27:45] trying to figure this out come back to
[2:27:47] home
[2:27:48] [Applause]
[2:27:53] how do you like that I forgot my thought
[2:27:56] you guys been listening come home yeah
[2:28:00] come home
[2:28:04] I know the pope is not supposed to be
[2:28:06] joking but I've done it for years
[2:28:13] so you see here he said oh yes I know
[2:28:16] where I'm at now here we see I'm a
[2:28:18] church Son of God
[2:28:21] so in that field there's got to be more
[2:28:31] it has nothing to do with your Earthly
[2:28:33] age
[2:28:34] [Applause]
[2:28:36] it has to do what you're placing
[2:28:41] [Music]
[2:28:42] come on people
[2:28:44] that's to do with your placing you know
[2:28:46] you got to be more than just one again
[2:28:48] you got to be pleased
[2:28:53] so brother Benham was saying first wave
[2:28:56] sheave
[2:28:56] [Applause]
[2:28:58] that came to maternity
[2:29:02] in this church right now brother cherry
[2:29:04] and this is something right now there's
[2:29:07] adopted people
[2:29:09] [Applause]
[2:29:17] in this assembly it's all of the field
[2:29:21] but don't worry there's not going to be
[2:29:24] a harvest
[2:29:25] until we all come to maturity
[2:29:27] [Applause]
[2:29:34] I had a neighbor one time I used to be a
[2:29:36] farmer and he had a farmer Namer and he
[2:29:38] worked he was a worker and when fall
[2:29:42] season he put he dumped all this wet
[2:29:44] corn in the bin they're supposed to be
[2:29:45] drying whatever ended up he must have
[2:29:47] not watched the whole been spoiled
[2:29:52] the bride is not going to go that way
[2:29:56] there's going to be enough preaching by
[2:29:58] the five-fold ministry
[2:30:03] they're going to take this word
[2:30:05] and they're going to preach it
[2:30:07] unadulterated
[2:30:08] [Applause]
[2:30:10] and they're going to preach the Original
[2:30:11] Seed
[2:30:13] and they're going to pray they're going
[2:30:15] to preach more than just brother Ben I'm
[2:30:16] a prophet they're going to tell you who
[2:30:19] you are
[2:30:19] [Applause]
[2:30:25] they're gonna tell you your name is
[2:30:28] written
[2:30:29] look
[2:30:30] [Applause]
[2:30:39] you'll never mature
[2:30:42] you'll never mature
[2:30:44] sitting under a ministry that's not
[2:30:47] willing to bring you all the word
[2:30:50] [Applause]
[2:30:58] remember whichever way the tree falls
[2:31:01] leans rather that's how it falls
[2:31:07] I want to go on with this quote
[2:31:10] he said we got to be children of this
[2:31:12] age
[2:31:14] to the pregnancy
[2:31:16] of the word of God
[2:31:18] you bring forth a child of this age
[2:31:27] and he's seeing a seed child
[2:31:34] not the stock
[2:31:36] not the tassel
[2:31:38] not the shock
[2:31:41] remember that was a good shock
[2:31:45] but I'll tell you what you know when the
[2:31:46] green dries is when the shuck
[2:31:50] pulls away
[2:31:52] now we're not here to call anybody shuck
[2:31:57] God will take care of that
[2:31:59] [Applause]
[2:32:02] but inside of there is the real train
[2:32:05] [Applause]
[2:32:09] Hallelujah
[2:32:14] I'm looking I'm looking at real golden
[2:32:18] grain word
[2:32:20] [Applause]
[2:32:25] [Music]
[2:32:26] it's time to mature
[2:32:29] get over the pity things
[2:32:32] it's just carnal
[2:32:35] do it what is Right according to the
[2:32:38] word
[2:32:39] [Applause]
[2:32:45] if you give me about 10 minutes can you
[2:32:47] do that please
[2:32:48] 10 minutes and we'll close
[2:32:51] but you see here
[2:32:53] brother Benjamin said unveiling of God
[2:32:57] the same Pillar of Fire
[2:33:00] they come upon those men that wrote the
[2:33:02] Bible
[2:33:04] it's the same Pillar of Fire here today
[2:33:07] interpreting the Bible
[2:33:09] [Applause]
[2:33:12] you know God is his own interpreter
[2:33:17] we don't have to make it come to pass we
[2:33:20] can't do it anyway
[2:33:23] he'll bring it to pass in his right time
[2:33:30] he said
[2:33:31] how we thank him what a comfort what an
[2:33:34] identification
[2:33:36] I'm so glad to be identified in that I
[2:33:38] don't know what to do I'd rather be
[2:33:40] identified than that than all the
[2:33:42] Baptist and methodists and Presbyterians
[2:33:44] and lutherans all the rest of them
[2:33:45] identified in that word where that's
[2:33:48] Shekinah Glory and Revelation Lays
[2:33:54] the pillar of fire is appearing visibly
[2:33:57] Among Us
[2:34:00] he still is
[2:34:03] identifying that the message is right
[2:34:08] [Music]
[2:34:11] what more do we need for identification
[2:34:16] I mean I mean even
[2:34:19] up there in Sabina Canyon Tucson he
[2:34:21] wrote the letter ego
[2:34:24] in the rock
[2:34:28] [Music]
[2:34:29] is Eagle age
[2:34:33] come on now
[2:34:35] he even let that all happen to the
[2:34:38] erosion and such on Sunset Mountain
[2:34:39] that's actually the display of brother
[2:34:41] Branham have you seen it
[2:34:45] you're real quiet on me I don't know if
[2:34:47] you saw it or not
[2:34:48] it's absolutely see brother Brown's
[2:34:51] profile
[2:34:54] no I'm not a fanatic
[2:34:57] but I'm telling you what
[2:35:00] we don't need any more signs
[2:35:04] to show us that this is the truth
[2:35:08] right now you are the greatest sign
[2:35:12] overlooked
[2:35:16] foreign
[2:35:18] you are the greatest sign overlooked
[2:35:21] right now
[2:35:21] [Applause]
[2:35:26] we were the nobodies
[2:35:29] in this world
[2:35:31] but we were the somebody's to him
[2:35:36] and he likes to take people and mold
[2:35:39] them
[2:35:42] well I don't know if you get up in the
[2:35:44] morning say hallelujah I want molding
[2:35:47] I say you need prayer
[2:35:51] because it comes anyway
[2:35:55] and I haven't always liked it
[2:36:02] and choosing of the right brother Adam
[2:36:04] said that molding will come by the the
[2:36:06] word of this age but you know it comes
[2:36:08] more than just hearing the word that
[2:36:09] mosia it's experience
[2:36:11] [Applause]
[2:36:21] invisible union soon closing
[2:36:24] foreign
[2:36:28] ERS won't make it
[2:36:35] I'm doubtful
[2:36:36] the god to be a thankful
[2:36:40] I'm thankful to God to be living in this
[2:36:43] time of the closing scenes of world's
[2:36:47] history
[2:36:50] I know if I would have had to see so
[2:36:53] before the foundation of the world if
[2:36:56] God would have laid out the whole
[2:36:57] program to me and said to me I want you
[2:37:01] to preach
[2:37:03] and now what age do you desire to go to
[2:37:06] Earth to preach I would have chose this
[2:37:10] age for I think this is the Golden Age
[2:37:14] [Applause]
[2:37:19] I certainly would have loved to been
[2:37:22] here than to turn the time of his visit
[2:37:25] to the Earth but still I think this
[2:37:27] right now is a greater time
[2:37:30] because it's a time that he's coming to
[2:37:33] take the people that is redeemed nearing
[2:37:37] the resurrection when all the redeem
[2:37:40] will come forth
[2:37:45] what a glorious
[2:37:47] opportunity
[2:37:49] we have to speak to a dying people
[2:37:54] [Applause]
[2:37:55] and we know that history is closing out
[2:38:00] in world's history will soon be over
[2:38:05] then we're going to step into a new day
[2:38:08] the great millennium
[2:38:15] let's bow our heads
[2:38:22] you've been such a kind audience
[2:38:26] I love you with all my heart
[2:38:30] you know Saints
[2:38:35] I've experienced
[2:38:38] they're just so much encouragement while
[2:38:40] being here
[2:38:41] not just hearing the word
[2:38:44] but some of you coming up to me and
[2:38:46] talking to me
[2:38:51] encouraging words
[2:38:58] to me that's
[2:39:01] what we felt here the love of God and
[2:39:03] the unity of the people
[2:39:06] that is a fulfillment
[2:39:09] of the message
[2:39:15] you know it doesn't make any difference
[2:39:18] what anybody has done
[2:39:21] it doesn't make any difference
[2:39:23] what somebody said
[2:39:28] I'll just give you a little instance
[2:39:31] I just recently heard brother Perry
[2:39:33] Green's testimony up at brother biscos
[2:39:35] many years ago
[2:39:38] and I want to be careful I do I say it
[2:39:40] right
[2:39:42] but brother green was riding with
[2:39:44] brother Benham
[2:39:46] brother random was telling about some
[2:39:48] things that had happened in a certain
[2:39:51] group of people
[2:39:53] and whether random was just laying it
[2:39:55] out for about two hours
[2:39:58] but they came to
[2:40:00] a place to stop for breakfast
[2:40:03] and he was talking about these brothers
[2:40:04] and so on
[2:40:06] what was wrong
[2:40:10] they were going to stop for breakfast
[2:40:11] and they ate breakfast and brother
[2:40:13] Branham turned to brother green
[2:40:16] and said what time is it brother Perry
[2:40:22] he told him the time
[2:40:24] he said well we're close enough now we
[2:40:28] can go and see those Brothers
[2:40:32] and brother green turned to him and said
[2:40:34] brother Brandon I don't understand
[2:40:40] you mean you've been telling me about
[2:40:41] what's all wrong there and you're going
[2:40:42] to go and see me and brother Benham
[2:40:44] turned to brother green and said I
[2:40:46] thought brother green you'd understand
[2:40:52] so no matter what has gone wrong
[2:40:55] where you've had difficulties with
[2:40:57] Ministries or people
[2:41:01] Never Lose Your Love
[2:41:05] Never Lose Your Love
[2:41:08] because that's what will make the
[2:41:11] difference
[2:41:13] I didn't bring the quote I read it at
[2:41:15] home
[2:41:16] but brother Benham was talking
[2:41:19] he said even if a brother is
[2:41:21] unscriptural
[2:41:24] I can't remember the words for words
[2:41:27] even on scriptural
[2:41:29] but love
[2:41:32] will override everything
[2:41:36] I don't know maybe I'm going this way
[2:41:38] for a reason
[2:41:40] [Music]
[2:41:41] so love of God is powerful
[2:41:45] [Music]
[2:41:48] forgiveness is powerful
[2:41:50] [Applause]

[2:42:09] and see what's all wrong what you think
[2:42:10] is wrong with the message
[2:42:12] garbage
[2:42:15] but you know what happened to me the
[2:42:17] other day and I didn't have a long
[2:42:18] discussion with him but this brother
[2:42:20] called me
[2:42:21] out of the blue I haven't heard from
[2:42:23] here for years
[2:42:27] and told me how he loved me and I know
[2:42:29] that I've heard I didn't want to get in
[2:42:31] the discussion with him I had heard he
[2:42:33] had left the word
[2:42:35] and he's a minister
[2:42:37] I never even brought it up
[2:42:40] because he said you know military I pray
[2:42:43] for you all the time
[2:42:48] I say God
[2:42:50] give me that Divine love
[2:42:55] give us that Divine love
[2:42:59] that will overcome all things

[2:43:40] side don't look for the nail scarred
[2:43:42] hand person
[2:43:43] or the one that can bring blood he said
