[38:50] amen amen i'm sure i'm happy to have one
[38:52] and
[38:53] i got to thinking about it yesterday i
[38:55] thought why do we do
[38:56] youth services
[38:58] why do we take an extra service and just
[39:00] do that
[39:01] because the devil is fighting you extra
[39:03] hard
[39:04] because he knows if he can get the
[39:06] hearts of the young people
[39:07] he can get the next generation and
[39:10] eventually it'll die
[39:12] but there god's program will not be
[39:14] stopped
[39:15] god's promise cannot be put down it
[39:17] could not be put out it must go on amen
[39:20] he has a seed and i believe that's you
[39:23] you got to put your own name there and
[39:25] say yeah brother andrew i believe that's
[39:26] me i'm here because god wants me to be
[39:29] here regardless of who else is here
[39:31] brother timothy's here because god wants
[39:33] brother timothy to be here to speak to
[39:36] us this afternoon and we're so looking
[39:38] forward to it amen
[39:41] the devil knows if you get a taste of
[39:43] victory
[39:45] it's game over for him
[39:48] you say well i still got all these other
[39:49] problems he knows if you just get a
[39:51] taste
[39:53] it's over the rest of those problems
[39:54] will begin to work themselves out
[39:57] because you've got a hold of god
[39:59] let go and let god get a hold of you
[40:02] this afternoon
[40:03] amen i just want to read one quote
[40:05] before i turn it over to brother timothy
[40:07] it says this in the
[40:08] in the message it wasn't so from the
[40:10] beginning brother bannon says if god
[40:12] poured out the holy ghost on the people
[40:14] at pentecost and that was his decision
[40:17] that how that the church must operate
[40:20] under the power of the holy spirit he
[40:22] cannot change that
[40:25] amen he's not going to change it today
[40:27] he says he cannot turn it over and say
[40:29] well i'll give you a bishop or i'll give
[40:30] you this or i'll give you that he's
[40:32] still got to remain with that same
[40:34] decision
[40:35] amen he's not changing it in this
[40:37] generation
[40:38] he's the same god
[40:40] and he says if the church on the day of
[40:42] pentecost received the baptism of the
[40:44] holy ghost and the reaction that came
[40:47] from that baptism of the holy ghost will
[40:49] be the same reaction on every person
[40:53] that ever receives the baptism of the
[40:56] holy ghost
[40:58] amen that's what we're looking for this
[40:59] afternoon
[41:01] i'm not asking for small things
[41:04] we don't want to put god down here and
[41:06] say well i'll just come and ask for a

[46:32] you're facing a lot of things that a lot
[46:34] of us

[46:43] people in this generation that are
[46:45] overcoming and
[46:46] and god is raising up amen souls to the
[46:49] kingdom of god and and gifts of god and
[46:53] right right in the middle of the darkest

[47:19] get comfortable here i
[47:21] brother joel forney i don't know how

[47:24] preach or fight in a coat
[47:26] and uh i agree with that
[47:29] amen
[47:31] john chapter 2 and verse 13
[47:34] the jews passover was at hand
[47:36] and jesus went up to jerusalem and found
[47:39] in the temple those that sold oxen and
[47:41] sheep
[47:42] and doves and changer of money sitting
[47:46] and when he had made a scourge of small
[47:48] courts
[47:49] he drove them all
[47:51] out of the temple
[47:53] the sheep the oxen and poured out the
[47:55] changers money and overthrew the tables
[47:58] and he said unto them that sold doves
[48:01] take these things hence
[48:03] make my make not my father's house a
[48:06] house of merchandise
[48:08] and his disciples remembered that it was
[48:11] written
[48:12] the zeal of thine house
[48:14] has eaten me up
[48:16] amen let's turn to revelations chapter
[48:18] three
[48:19] i'd like to speak to you today on the
[48:21] zeal of my father's house
[48:24] the zeal of my father's house
[48:26] and unto the angel of the church of the
[48:28] laodicean's right these things saith the
[48:31] amen
[48:32] the faithful and true witness
[48:35] the beginning of the creation of god i
[48:37] know thy works that thou art neither
[48:39] cold nor hot i would that thou work cold
[48:43] or hot so then because thou art lukewarm
[48:46] and neither cold nor hot i will spew
[48:48] thee out of my mouth because thou sayest
[48:51] i am rich and increase with goods and
[48:54] have need of nothing
[48:55] know us not that thou art wretched
[48:57] miserable poor blind and naked i counsel
[49:01] thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[49:04] that thou mayest be rich and white
[49:06] raiment that thou mayest be clothed and
[49:09] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[49:12] appear
[49:13] and anoint thine eyes with i salve
[49:17] that they thou may see
[49:19] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[49:23] be zealous therefore and repent
[49:26] behold i stand at the door and knock if
[49:29] any man hear my voice
[49:31] and open the door i will come unto him
[49:33] and will sup with him and he with me to
[49:36] him that overcometh will i grant to sit
[49:40] with me in my throne
[49:42] even as i also
[49:44] have overcome and have sat down with my
[49:46] father in his throne
[49:48] he that hath an ear
[49:50] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[49:53] the churches
[49:54] amen god bless you you can be seated
[49:56] today
[49:59] i'd like to speak to you as i said on
[50:00] the zeal
[50:02] of my father's house
[50:05] just looking at this word zeal
[50:07] is a great energy
[50:10] or enthusiasm
[50:12] in pursuit of a certain cause or an
[50:15] objective
[50:16] zeal is all out it's committed
[50:20] it's convicted it's drastic
[50:23] it's extreme it's intense it's
[50:26] passionate it's radical it's severe
[50:30] zeal opposes average
[50:32] comfortable
[50:34] cautious
[50:35] indifferent lethargic moderate normal or
[50:39] usual
[50:40] amen so i believe that uh god is looking
[50:44] for someone who has some real zeal about
[50:47] the things of god
[50:49] as he would have zeal about his father's
[50:51] house as he would see
[50:53] he would come you know he would wanted
[50:55] he wanted someone that would love him
[50:58] he didn't want to give a bunch of rules
[50:59] and regulations and laws and you do this
[51:02] or you don't do that he wanted a people
[51:05] that would love him and you know he
[51:07] didn't want to have to give them you do
[51:09] this on certain days don't do this on
[51:11] certain days uh you know and all the
[51:13] laws and all the regulations and things
[51:15] that he had placed there that was not
[51:17] his desire his desire was somebody that
[51:20] would serve him because they loved him
[51:23] and out of their love they would be
[51:25] committed they would be convicted they
[51:27] didn't have to have a rule or a
[51:28] regulation they didn't do it because it
[51:30] was a rule of regulation they would do
[51:32] it because they loved him and you know i
[51:35] look at at the time in your youth and i
[51:37] i remember you know when i was a young
[51:40] person the energy that i would at once
[51:42] have and and and the zeal for things and
[51:45] all of that and a lot of times you go
[51:47] all in on things you know everything
[51:49] that you do you want to be all out you
[51:51] want to be committed you know you want
[51:52] to you know if you're going to be a
[51:54] snowboarder you want to be all in that
[51:56] you get every all the gear and you get
[51:58] everything that you got to have got to
[52:00] have the best you know you got to do
[52:01] because there's some path there's a
[52:03] passion in there amen for that or if
[52:06] it's a hockey or or football or
[52:08] basketball whatever it is hunting amen
[52:10] there's something there that you want to
[52:12] try to put your passions and your goals
[52:14] and and what you're trying to do now i i
[52:16] i believe that if somebody's a real true
[52:19] hunter and their trophy hunter they're
[52:21] not satisfied with just killing a little
[52:23] spike deer or or a little doe or
[52:26] something they're looking for a real
[52:27] trophy and they'll they'll do whatever
[52:29] it takes to gain that because there's a
[52:31] zeal or a passion there
[52:33] and you know when i and your youth you
[52:35] have a you have the ability or the
[52:37] energy amen to put that kind of passion
[52:40] into things and now me now at 45 one day
[52:43] i used to run down the court and play
[52:45] basketball and i i don't find it that
[52:47] easy to do that anymore
[52:49] i find it that it hurts i find that i
[52:51] just don't have the same zeal for that
[52:53] anymore i i don't really care to do that
[52:56] anymore you know things have changed i'm
[52:58] coming up towards maybe being a grandpa
[53:00] and things in my life things are moving
[53:02] in a different direction but there was
[53:04] one time that i couldn't wait for some
[53:05] guys to call me and say hey let's go
[53:07] play a pickup basketball game let's go
[53:10] play this let's go do that because there
[53:11] was a zeal there was a passion there was
[53:13] something in my heart for those kind of
[53:16] things and you know and i and i'm
[53:17] looking at this as the way you're you're
[53:20] right at the prime of your life to to
[53:22] give everything you have to god amen you
[53:25] don't you don't have to wait till you're
[53:27] 20 or to your 30 or to your 40 to
[53:30] surrender everything and that well then
[53:32] but then you won't have the energy that
[53:34] you have now and god is looking for
[53:36] someone who will be convicted uh
[53:38] committed convicted will be extreme amen
[53:42] you know the world is becoming extreme
[53:44] how come we can't become extreme about
[53:46] the things of god amen they're becoming
[53:48] extreme about their ideas and what
[53:50] they're doing and how they're doing
[53:52] things and they become so extreme and so
[53:54] passionate about their rights and and
[53:57] all that they got you know they'll go
[53:58] out and they'll paint their hair purple
[54:00] they'll tattoo their bodies they'll
[54:01] they'll pierce their bodies they'll do
[54:03] why because they have a passion towards
[54:05] that and i have to think that on the
[54:08] other side there's a people with a
[54:09] passion there's young people with a
[54:11] passion towards the things of god amen
[54:14] that is not just a bunch of rules or
[54:16] regulations or ideas of men you don't
[54:19] look at it that way but you do it
[54:20] because you love god you do it not
[54:23] because your pastor said it or your
[54:24] daddy said it amen but you do what you
[54:27] do because you love god amen that's
[54:30] where it has to be you know i i don't
[54:32] look at this message as a bunch of rules
[54:34] and regulations and things i look at it
[54:36] as a love of god that has been poured
[54:38] into this generation a love for me that
[54:41] he would find me in my sin and he'd find
[54:44] me in my doubt my unbelief and he'd find
[54:46] me you say well brother timothy he was
[54:48] born in a christian family you was born
[54:50] in a preacher's home you're a pk you
[54:52] know you got it all you was you yeah i
[54:55] had more pressure than most people had
[54:57] amen but yet i was one of the biggest
[54:59] hypocrites anybody had ever been because
[55:01] i could act the part i could look the
[55:03] part i could i could do it all but
[55:05] inside of me i didn't have the love for
[55:08] but one day god came on the scene for me
[55:11] and it began to show me that it wasn't
[55:13] just for my father it wasn't just for my
[55:15] mother it wasn't just for somebody else
[55:18] it was for me and i want you to
[55:21] understand god is trying to show you
[55:23] this morning or this afternoon that amen
[55:25] it ain't just for your daddy it ain't
[55:27] just for your mama daddy may be
[55:29] passionate about the word of god mama
[55:31] maybe but god wants to place that same
[55:34] passion on the inside of you amen i love
[55:37] that it can be a love affair between you
[55:39] and god
[55:41] you know but i i know one of the hardest
[55:43] things for young people to accept is
[55:45] love
[55:47] real care you know nobody cares nobody
[55:50] understands nobody knows what i'm going
[55:52] through nobody nobody knows the
[55:54] situation that i'm facing nobody would
[55:56] understand if i tried to sit down in a
[55:58] two and three hour conver conversation
[56:00] because i you know i'm on my own that's
[56:02] just what the devil is wanting you to
[56:04] think he's trying to pull you away now
[56:06] hasn't he devised such a plan in the
[56:09] last few years as he's pulled people
[56:11] away and we've had the social distance
[56:13] we've had a
[56:15] quarantine we had to pull ourselves back
[56:17] and we've been in fellowship and he's
[56:19] trying to get people alone so they'll
[56:21] think that nobody loves them nobody
[56:23] cares nobody understands but let me tell
[56:26] you something your mama your daddy loves
[56:28] you
[56:31] amen they love you with their hearts
[56:33] they love you amen and even if
[56:36] correction sometimes seems hard and it
[56:38] seems like why you don't know why
[56:40] they're doing it because they love you
[56:43] amen this is where god would say amen i
[56:45] i have to bring this correction but i'm
[56:48] doing it because i love you
[56:51] amen see amen see so if god is looking
[56:54] for you to be as i
[56:55] have zealousness or or zeal about you he
[56:58] would not pl i want you to do that
[57:00] without him being that himself so we've
[57:02] just read the scripture as he would do
[57:04] what he'd done the disciples will
[57:07] remember amen what the prophet had spoke
[57:09] about the zeal of my house
[57:12] amen so i want to look at a few things
[57:14] on zeal
[57:15] because god is not lazy concerning his
[57:18] word god is going to bring to pass his
[57:20] word he's going to perform what he said
[57:22] he would do therefore he has a passion
[57:24] to watch over and to bring it to pass we
[57:27] can read in isaiah 9 and verse 6 says
[57:29] for unto us a child is born unto us a
[57:32] son is given the government shall be
[57:34] upon his shoulder and the name shall be
[57:36] called wonderful counselor the mighty
[57:39] god the everlasting father the prince of
[57:41] peace of the increase of his government
[57:43] peace there shall be no end upon the
[57:45] throne of david and upon his kingdom to
[57:47] order it to establish it with judgment
[57:50] with justice from henceforth even
[57:52] forever the zeal of the lord of hosts
[57:55] will perform this
[57:56] amen i'm going to watch over this and
[57:58] i'm going to make sure it's going to
[58:00] happen and he was watching over a little
[58:02] teenage girl and watching over her womb
[58:05] and watching over her purity and
[58:07] watching over her to make sure she was
[58:09] there at the moment amen to meet the
[58:11] angel of god that god could come and
[58:13] bring her a special visitation and what
[58:16] was born in her was not born a man but
[58:18] born of the holy ghost
[58:21] and he was zealous and he watched over
[58:23] and he made sure it would come to pass
[58:26] we look in isaiah 59 and verse 16 he
[58:29] said he saw that there was no man and
[58:31] wondered that there was no intercessor
[58:33] therefore his arm brought him salvation
[58:35] unto him and his righteousness it
[58:37] sustained him for he put on
[58:39] righteousness as a breastplate and a
[58:42] helmet of salvation upon his head and he
[58:44] put on the garments of vengeance for
[58:46] clothes and would clad with a zeal a
[58:48] zeal as a cloak amen he put it on as
[58:51] close he put it he surrounded himself in
[58:54] zeal according to their deeds according
[58:57] he will repay fury to his adversaries
[59:00] recompense to his enemies to the islands
[59:02] he will pay recompense so shall they
[59:05] fear the name of the lord from the west
[59:07] from the glory and his glory from the
[59:09] rising of the sun when the enemy shall
[59:12] come in like a flood the spirit of the
[59:14] lord shall raise up a standard against
[59:16] him the redeemer shall come to zion and
[59:19] unto them that turn from
[59:21] transgression in jacob saith the lord as
[59:23] for me this is my covenant with them
[59:26] saith the lord my spirit is upon thee
[59:28] and my words which i put in my mouth
[59:30] shall not depart out of the mouth nor
[59:32] out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of
[59:34] the mouth of thy seed seed saith the
[59:36] lord from henceforth and forevermore he
[59:39] said i'm going to clothe myself with
[59:41] zeal as a cloak and i'm going to bring
[59:44] this to pass amen i want you to
[59:46] understand your enemy is not going to
[59:48] get away with what he's done to you
[59:51] but god is going to pay repay him recon
[59:53] recompense to what he has done to you
[59:56] amen he's not going to get away with
[59:58] nothing the devil is not going to get
[1:00:00] away with tormenting you and spirits
[1:00:02] that's coming against your mind he's not
[1:00:05] going to get away with it
[1:00:07] but god is going to bring judgment upon
[1:00:10] him
[1:00:10] [Music]
[1:00:12] ezekiel 5 and verse 11 says wherefore as
[1:00:15] i live saith the lord god surely because
[1:00:18] thou has defiled my sanctuary with all
[1:00:21] thy detestable things and with all thy
[1:00:23] abominations therefore will i also
[1:00:25] diminish thee neither shall my eyes
[1:00:27] spare neither will i a pity a third part
[1:00:30] of thee shall die with pestilence and
[1:00:32] with famine shalt thou be consumed in
[1:00:34] the midst of thee the third part shall
[1:00:36] fall by the sword round about thee and
[1:00:37] i'll scatter the third part with all the
[1:00:40] winds and i'll draw so out of sword
[1:00:42] after them thus shall my anger be
[1:00:44] accomplished and i will cause my fury to
[1:00:46] rest upon them and i will have comfort
[1:00:49] and they shall know that i the lord have
[1:00:52] spoken it in my zeal
[1:00:54] amen when i have accomplished my fury
[1:00:57] upon me and we also find that not only
[1:00:59] does he have a great zeal towards your
[1:01:01] enemy or to somebody that
[1:01:03] willfully disobeys him but he also has a
[1:01:06] great zeal for you
[1:01:10] zechariah 1 16 says therefore thus saith
[1:01:13] the lord i am returned to jerusalem with
[1:01:16] mercies my house shall be built upon it
[1:01:18] saith the lord of hosts and a lion shall
[1:01:20] be stretched forth upon jerusalem thus
[1:01:22] saith the lord of hosts i was zealous
[1:01:25] for zion with a great jealousy i was
[1:01:28] jealous it's the same word i was jealous
[1:01:30] was for zion with a great jealousy i was
[1:01:32] jealous for her with great fury so god
[1:01:36] has a zeal for you he has a passion for
[1:01:39] you
[1:01:40] [Applause]
[1:01:41] god loves you
[1:01:45] even when you think yourself to be
[1:01:47] unlovable or anybody else don't love you
[1:01:50] or anybody else don't care god loves you
[1:01:55] god cares about you god knows what
[1:01:58] you're going through he knows the mind
[1:02:00] battles he knows the spirits of
[1:02:02] oppression he knows the things that are
[1:02:04] coming against you time after time after
[1:02:06] time and the doctors want to say well
[1:02:08] you got this problem and you got that
[1:02:10] problem no it's a devil that's coming
[1:02:12] against you
[1:02:13] but god is going to bring recompense
[1:02:15] upon your enemy and bring him down for
[1:02:18] destruction
[1:02:19] [Applause]
[1:02:22] the devil will not win
[1:02:26] now that ought to make us rejoice right
[1:02:28] now because some of you the devil's been
[1:02:30] tormenting you and he's been telling you
[1:02:32] you ain't gonna make it he's been
[1:02:34] telling you your daddy might have been
[1:02:35] okay but you're not okay he's been
[1:02:37] telling you you're going to hell he's
[1:02:39] been telling you you're losing he's not
[1:02:41] been telling you you're going to lose
[1:02:42] everything he's been telling you all
[1:02:44] kinds of things you know what he's doing
[1:02:46] he's telling you his own thoughts
[1:02:49] [Applause]
[1:02:51] because that is what the word has said
[1:02:53] about him he's going to lose everything
[1:02:55] he's no he's not eternal he's going to
[1:02:58] hell
[1:03:00] hallelujah if he told you you're going
[1:03:02] to hell that's only because he has seen
[1:03:04] it in the word for himself he knows what
[1:03:07] his end's going to be
[1:03:09] and he's only trying to give you his
[1:03:11] thoughts
[1:03:12] [Applause]
[1:03:14] he has such a passion for his word he
[1:03:17] has such a passion for his people he has
[1:03:19] such a passion for his house
[1:03:23] and i ain't just talking about this
[1:03:24] wooden structure here i'm talking about
[1:03:26] these these buildings of clay sitting
[1:03:29] right here in front of me he has such a
[1:03:31] passion for what goes on on the inside
[1:03:33] of there
[1:03:36] he has such a passion
[1:03:38] jesus found they had turned sacrifices
[1:03:41] into
[1:03:42] traditions and this is where we got to
[1:03:44] be very careful that we don't turn this
[1:03:47] message into nothing but a tradition
[1:03:49] a learned behavior
[1:03:52] we're not interested in a learned
[1:03:54] behavior we're interested in the life of
[1:03:56] the message
[1:03:58] there is a life amen to where it becomes
[1:04:01] such a just a form of worship to where
[1:04:03] they made it into a money-making deal
[1:04:05] and that's all they had thought about
[1:04:06] was you know to be and they made it easy
[1:04:08] for everybody you know you just come up
[1:04:11] here and instead of raising the lamb
[1:04:13] instead of it becoming part of you and
[1:04:15] part of your your your
[1:04:17] of what you've done and you've put put
[1:04:18] your time and effort into it and you now
[1:04:20] you just come here and you pay a few
[1:04:22] pennies and or pence and you get you a
[1:04:24] dove or you get your lamb it's already
[1:04:26] provided for you listen we want more
[1:04:28] than that
[1:04:29] we want something that's real
[1:04:32] and i mean you can this this what this
[1:04:35] life cannot be handed down listen as
[1:04:37] much as i would love to i would love to
[1:04:39] just hand it to my son or hand it to my
[1:04:41] daughter it can't be handed by me it
[1:04:44] only can come from god himself but god
[1:04:46] has such a passion amen for his word and
[1:04:49] for his people that he'll provide a
[1:04:51] place to where they can come in the
[1:04:53] right atmosphere and god can draw them
[1:04:56] close to him and have fellowship with
[1:04:58] him and love affair began
[1:05:01] god is passionate for you
[1:05:08] john chapter 2 and verse 17. i'll read
[1:05:10] it again
[1:05:11] in another translation and this is where
[1:05:13] i heard this
[1:05:15] many years ago and preached from this
[1:05:18] his disciples remembered that the
[1:05:20] scripture said
[1:05:22] my devotion to your house o god
[1:05:26] burns in me like a fire
[1:05:32] like a fire
[1:05:34] something like jeremiah would say it's
[1:05:35] like fire shut up in my bones
[1:05:38] amen there's something that's going on
[1:05:40] the inside of me that i can't contain it
[1:05:43] no more i want everyone else to know hey
[1:05:46] man you listen we want a revival you
[1:05:47] know where the revival starts with
[1:05:51] amen it starts with me
[1:05:54] it starts with you it starts
[1:05:55] individually amen you know the brother
[1:05:57] brandon said if we can get one or two
[1:05:59] people on fire for god it'll do more for
[1:06:02] a church than 40 revivals
[1:06:05] amen what can this church these young
[1:06:07] people do to this church if you get one
[1:06:09] or two of them on fire and it begins to
[1:06:11] spread it begins to move and it begins
[1:06:13] to go over here and then all of a sudden
[1:06:15] there's a passion for the things of god
[1:06:19] oh you got a passion for hockey and you
[1:06:21] got a passion for this why don't you
[1:06:22] turn your attention towards something
[1:06:24] that's eternal
[1:06:27] i mean i think about it you know we just
[1:06:28] had i just read the day that finally
[1:06:30] somebody won wanted but they had such a
[1:06:32] passion for this lottery that was going
[1:06:34] on you know it's building up and
[1:06:35] building up and it's getting up to one
[1:06:37] point something billion dollars and
[1:06:38] people were like well what could i do if
[1:06:40] i got that and what could i do if i
[1:06:42] could buy this and i could do that i
[1:06:43] could pay off debt and i could buy three
[1:06:45] homes that i could buy 10 cars and i can
[1:06:47] buy it i can buy and i can buy they had
[1:06:49] a passion and they would do whatever
[1:06:51] they could to go buy them a ticket
[1:06:53] and they would get lines or whatever it
[1:06:55] takes i got to have one of them and i
[1:06:57] got to have just a chance of winning
[1:06:59] just a chance listen i want you to
[1:07:01] understand you're here by more than just
[1:07:04] a chance
[1:07:05] you're here by the predestinated will of
[1:07:07] almighty god and we're not here to win
[1:07:10] something that's just a temporary moment
[1:07:12] and a temporary pleasure and 1.3 billion
[1:07:15] dollars can burn in an instant and be
[1:07:17] all gone and worthless but i'm here to
[1:07:19] tell you there's something that you can
[1:07:21] be passionate about that's not going to
[1:07:23] go down it's not going to wear out it's
[1:07:25] not going to be a gone and one day one
[1:07:27] here the next and day the next day it's
[1:07:29] cold no this word is eternal
[1:07:33] oil and there's a young people that say
[1:07:35] i have a passion for the things of god
[1:07:40] the seal of my father's house is heating
[1:07:43] me up
[1:07:44] [Applause]
[1:07:46] some of us can tell about
[1:07:48] i i i'll be honest with you i couldn't i
[1:07:50] can't hardly name
[1:07:51] even a couple hockey teams
[1:07:53] but i guarantee you that someone here
[1:07:55] can name not only every hockey team they
[1:07:56] can name every person on the hockey team
[1:07:59] how many
[1:07:59] [Laughter]
[1:08:02] how many goals and how many of this and
[1:08:04] how many of that and how many penalties
[1:08:07] and he spent this many minutes in the
[1:08:08] penalty box and why you had a passion
[1:08:11] for it
[1:08:12] but if you turn that passion
[1:08:15] toward the things of god
[1:08:18] then you would know what the preacher is
[1:08:19] talking about when he said brother
[1:08:20] branham said and
[1:08:24] oh you know what i just read that
[1:08:27] i just heard that on the table that that
[1:08:29] does something for me amen let's turn to
[1:08:31] such and say i just read that this
[1:08:33] morning
[1:08:34] and so why because there's something on
[1:08:36] the inside of you that is wanting more
[1:08:39] of god

[1:09:24] going down towards that fire amen god

[1:15:16] and i became a young person just like
[1:15:18] you are
[1:15:20] so i would know what it was like to deal
[1:15:23] with young people's thoughts
[1:15:25] i would know what it's like to have to
[1:15:26] deal with a suicide demon that would
[1:15:28] come against me and say hey just throw
[1:15:30] off throw yourself off of this building
[1:15:32] and we'll know your god
[1:15:36] what was going on glory jesus was having
[1:15:38] a mind battle
[1:15:40] the devil was working on him trying to
[1:15:43] take his very life
[1:15:46] in a perverted way
[1:15:48] he was going to give us life but the
[1:15:50] devil was trying to take his life
[1:15:53] this is what god wants you to do he
[1:15:56] don't want to take your life he wants
[1:15:57] you to give your life give your life to
[1:16:00] him and let him do something for you
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:07] he's a god of zeal
[1:16:11] he's not indifferent concerning you
[1:16:14] he knows what you're going through
[1:16:18] the zeal the lord will the host lord of
[1:16:21] hosts will perform what he said he would
[1:16:22] do
[1:16:25] you know brother brown was set like this
[1:16:26] with spiritual adoption he said how i
[1:16:28] want him to say
[1:16:30] well done
[1:16:31] amen
[1:16:33] not by the skin of my teeth
[1:16:35] but it was well done my good and
[1:16:37] faithful servant enter into the joys of
[1:16:40] the lord for you did well with what you
[1:16:42] had to do with
[1:16:45] you say well brother timothy i'm not as
[1:16:47] gifted as some of these well i ain't
[1:16:48] either
[1:16:50] amen i
[1:16:51] don't want to pick on our young brother
[1:16:52] right there the redheaded fellow
[1:16:55] but when god poured out the gifts he
[1:16:57] poured a bucket on top of him
[1:17:00] and i get jealous
[1:17:02] i want to play the piano i want to play
[1:17:04] the guitar i want to play the bass i
[1:17:06] want to do that
[1:17:07] but that wasn't what god gave me
[1:17:11] but no matter how you how insignificant
[1:17:14] you feel today and you feel like i can't
[1:17:16] do anything
[1:17:17] you're still important to god
[1:17:22] [Laughter]
[1:17:23] you say well i just feel like nothing
[1:17:25] well let me tell you if you feel like
[1:17:27] you're the skin
[1:17:29] on the bottom of his feet
[1:17:31] try walking without skin on the bottom
[1:17:33] of your feet
[1:17:36] it's not possible it hurts get a little
[1:17:38] cut down there and see how hard it is to
[1:17:40] walk and that skin becomes very
[1:17:42] important
[1:17:44] amen but i can read over in revelations
[1:17:46] 10 when that angel put his foot down
[1:17:48] upon the land upon the sea
[1:17:50] amen he's putting it over the amen over
[1:17:52] the demon powers in the land and in the
[1:17:54] sea
[1:17:56] and when you might be the skin on the
[1:17:58] bottom of his feet but guess what that
[1:18:00] still means every devil's under you
[1:18:04] so you're very important to the economy
[1:18:06] of god you're very important to this
[1:18:08] church or whatever church you go to even
[1:18:10] though you may not feel like it well i'm
[1:18:12] not a soul leader i'm not this i'm not
[1:18:14] that but be the best a manner you can be
[1:18:18] be the best christian you can be show
[1:18:20] the love of god greater amen do whatever
[1:18:23] you can for the kingdom of god
[1:18:26] amen you may not be but somebody in the
[1:18:28] little orchestra that just does a little
[1:18:30] tinkle tinkle sound but when you get
[1:18:32] your time play it with all your hearts
[1:18:35] give everything you got to this gospel
[1:18:41] never forget
[1:18:42] my uncle that lives beside me had a
[1:18:44] grand has a grandson and he got into
[1:18:46] video games and he became very good at
[1:18:48] video games
[1:18:50] and it took up all of his time and his
[1:18:52] efforts and he became very zealous about
[1:18:54] this game and that game and he can tell
[1:18:55] you all about it
[1:18:56] you know we had a guy show up at youth
[1:18:57] camp
[1:18:58] somebody had brought him one of he was a
[1:19:00] friend of one of the kids that was
[1:19:01] supposed to be a message kid anyway
[1:19:03] they'd gotten a video game world and
[1:19:05] this boy showed up you know what his
[1:19:06] claim to flame fame was he was number
[1:19:08] three in the world
[1:19:10] whoa
[1:19:12] at a video game
[1:19:16] and when he dies that's all he's got
[1:19:19] number three in the world number three
[1:19:22] in the world
[1:19:24] number three in the world
[1:19:26] and all the time and the wasted effort
[1:19:28] he gave and he was so zealous and he was
[1:19:31] so into and so passionate about to where
[1:19:33] he became number three in the world
[1:19:36] and that's his claim to fame
[1:19:40] and my uncle would tell this grandson he
[1:19:42] said son you know if you'd put as much
[1:19:44] energy in that video game you'd put it
[1:19:46] in he bought it and bought him a nice
[1:19:47] guitar and he brought it to him he said
[1:19:49] i want i i want you to take this guitar
[1:19:51] and i want you to put as much energy and
[1:19:53] passion in this guitar as you have those
[1:19:56] video games and let's see what god will
[1:19:58] do with it before long that bad boy
[1:20:00] became he's actually really a
[1:20:02] world-class guitarist because it became
[1:20:04] his passion it became everything that he
[1:20:07] thought about and direct i mean you'd
[1:20:08] see him at a you'd see you'd see him at
[1:20:10] a youth event he'd have his guitar you'd
[1:20:12] see him after church he'd go out and sit
[1:20:14] on a on the on the tailgate pull it down
[1:20:16] on his truck and they're out there
[1:20:17] playing on his guitar it became his
[1:20:19] drive and his passion amen
[1:20:22] and i tell you
[1:20:24] young people if you would have that and
[1:20:25] you would turn that energy you got
[1:20:27] towards the things of god
[1:20:31] toward the things of god and the tapes
[1:20:34] and reading your bible and praying amen
[1:20:36] you would be a lot further down the road
[1:20:39] amen the bible says seek ye first the
[1:20:41] kingdom of god our passion becomes this
[1:20:44] boy or this girl or this what am i going
[1:20:46] to do for a living what am i going where
[1:20:48] am i going to go to school and that
[1:20:49] becomes our thoughts and our drives amen
[1:20:51] your first thought and your first
[1:20:53] passion should be the word of god
[1:20:56] because he said seek first the kingdom
[1:20:58] of god and all these things will be
[1:21:00] added to you
[1:21:06] i want him to say well done

[1:21:33] hands because i know i'll never hear it
[1:21:42] that hits pretty deep
[1:21:45] i want to hear it
[1:21:47] i want to hear him say
[1:21:49] you've done well
[1:21:50] he says maybe you're a housewife if you
[1:21:52] are god made you a teacher of your
[1:21:54] children do a good job of it but
[1:21:56] regardless of what you do
[1:21:59] do it well
[1:22:02] notice he said if the children did prove
[1:22:04] to be real worthy of things the father
[1:22:06] had in his kingdom it's in spiritual
[1:22:08] adoption he said he'd been faithful
[1:22:10] child the tutor brought the message oh
[1:22:12] your son he said that's what the message
[1:22:14] i wanted to bring for you and i
[1:22:16] your son his whole thoughts are upon you
[1:22:21] all he's trying to do is please you he's
[1:22:24] so interested in your affair until it's
[1:22:27] hard to hold him down he said i would
[1:22:29] rather be a little overzealous about the
[1:22:31] father's kingdom than to have no ze zeal
[1:22:34] for it at all
[1:22:37] he said the church the christ preacher
[1:22:38] told me some time ago brother branham i
[1:22:40] would rather wear out than rust out he
[1:22:43] said that's a lot of truth i would
[1:22:44] rather wear out than and die in the
[1:22:46] harness than to refuse to have the
[1:22:49] harness on
[1:22:51] you can't do nothing any worse than
[1:22:53] neglect to try let us do all we can with
[1:22:57] what we have to do with
[1:23:02] hallelujah
[1:23:04] but the question is why
[1:23:06] when god makes a provision or makes a
[1:23:09] way of escape for people and they refuse
[1:23:12] it
[1:23:13] then god asks the question why
[1:23:17] this is jeremiah 8 and verse 22 he says
[1:23:20] is there no bomb in gilead
[1:23:23] is there no physician there
[1:23:25] why then is not the health of the
[1:23:28] daughter of my people recovered
[1:23:32] this is a question that jeremiah under
[1:23:34] inspiration of god asked as he brought
[1:23:36] this message many years ago to the
[1:23:38] temple the city and the people had all
[1:23:40] together gone away from god and god told
[1:23:42] jeremiah to told jeremiah the prophet to
[1:23:44] go stand the gate and say these words is
[1:23:47] there no bomb in gilead is there no
[1:23:50] physician there and if there is why is
[1:23:53] the health of my daughter my people
[1:23:55] which is the church not recovered the
[1:23:58] question is why when god makes the
[1:24:00] provision
[1:24:02] why would we not take it
[1:24:05] when god provides the ability to live an
[1:24:08] overcoming life why would we not accept
[1:24:11] it
[1:24:13] when god gives the ability amen to live
[1:24:16] above sin and live above pornography and
[1:24:19] live above things of this life why would
[1:24:21] we not accept it
[1:24:25] he said i wonder he said when this
[1:24:27] united states of america which is my
[1:24:29] home sweet home when god's great book is
[1:24:32] opened at the day of judgment and this
[1:24:34] nation is brought under judgment when he
[1:24:36] points his finger to the ministries that
[1:24:38] have crossed four back and forth to this
[1:24:40] nation preaching the gospel showing
[1:24:42] great signs and wonders of his coming
[1:24:44] and the angels of god who accompany the
[1:24:46] ministry standing there to witness when
[1:24:48] america has asked why did you not repent
[1:24:51] he said i wonder what answer they'll
[1:24:52] have but when they continually give it
[1:24:55] listen this give in to the devices of
[1:24:58] the devil
[1:25:00] as the gospel moves they become more
[1:25:02] radical in their sin every year
[1:25:07] then well
[1:25:08] let me see what year this one this was
[1:25:10] 1959 imagine what he would say today
[1:25:15] they become more radical in their
[1:25:17] thinking and more radical in their ways
[1:25:19] and more radical to where we are now not
[1:25:22] considered normal we're far from normal
[1:25:25] the world is what they consider normal
[1:25:27] what's normal now is to have amen same
[1:25:30] sex marriages and all these that's
[1:25:32] what's normal now
[1:25:35] it's almost more normal amen to have a
[1:25:37] purple hairdo than have a black hair red
[1:25:40] hair or any kind of other
[1:25:41] it's everything else has become more
[1:25:43] normal
[1:25:48] sin has become greater
[1:25:50] so we're living in that great day when
[1:25:51] great signs of the lord are appearing
[1:25:54] ministers anointed with the spirit of
[1:25:55] god are preaching their hearts out and
[1:25:57] people are still ignoring it he said i
[1:26:00] wonder what kind of answer is going to
[1:26:01] be given at the judgment why did you not
[1:26:04] accept it
[1:26:07] why
[1:26:10] well i wanna i i just gotta know it's
[1:26:12] god
[1:26:14] well you know there was a man one time

[1:27:40] given into the devices of the devil
[1:27:43] first second corinthians 2 and verse 11
[1:27:45] said lest satan should get an advantage
[1:27:47] over us for we are not ignorant of his
[1:27:50] devices
[1:27:53] and boy doesn't he have some devices
[1:27:54] today

[1:28:10] i had to go look i'm just going to say
[1:28:12] it out open i know some parents get
[1:28:14] offended by it but they need to open
[1:28:17] their eyes and see what the devil's
[1:28:18] doing
[1:28:19] i had to go look for pornography
[1:28:22] now you don't have to look for it
[1:28:24] it's right in your
[1:28:26] that's pocket that's the truth
[1:28:30] it's there calling at you that siren
[1:28:33] song know what i'm talking about those
[1:28:35] sailors would go by and there would be
[1:28:37] those beautiful women singing over there
[1:28:39] and they knew if they would give into it
[1:28:41] they was going to die
[1:28:43] that's exactly what is happening amen in
[1:28:45] our phones and things and i you know i'm
[1:28:47] guilty as anybody spending too much time
[1:28:50] but we need to be really careful
[1:28:52] the time we give those things
[1:28:57] well it was for business is for this or
[1:28:59] that and some of those things are
[1:29:00] needful and we live in the age that
[1:29:02] those things are and but you got to be
[1:29:05] careful with them
[1:29:07] because they're
[1:29:08] devices they're ways that satan can
[1:29:11] enter into your mind and and i can't
[1:29:13] tell you how many young people we've
[1:29:15] prayed for that had visible
[1:29:17] manifestations of demons and you'd get
[1:29:19] and those demons would leave and as we
[1:29:21] heard last night it wasn't just one
[1:29:23] there's been many and you talk to them
[1:29:25] later it's like where did you pick this
[1:29:27] up where did this come from and almost
[1:29:29] every one of them would say from
[1:29:31] pornography boy or girl
[1:29:35] it's a rampant problem
[1:29:38] it's running rampant in our our young
[1:29:40] people and not just our young people
[1:29:42] it's running rampant in our churches and
[1:29:44] the older ones and everybody else why
[1:29:46] because it's so accessible
[1:29:49] the devil has made sin so accessible
[1:29:53] you don't have to go look for it you
[1:29:54] don't have to go down the street and buy
[1:29:56] a magazine no more you don't have to go
[1:29:58] it is there right before you
[1:30:00] [Applause]

[1:30:27] when you're getting those prayer lines
[1:30:28] and places and you see those
[1:30:29] manifestations of the devil my young son
[1:30:32] andrew amen he said he said one thing it
[1:30:34] done for me he said i saw that and them
[1:30:36] demons come out and i saw those faces
[1:30:38] changed i saw i heard him speak i saw
[1:30:41] that the devil was real
[1:30:43] he said but not only did i see that the
[1:30:45] devil was real i saw god was real
[1:30:48] hallelujah amen i believe the devil
[1:30:51] tries to set traps and he tries to do
[1:30:53] things and it always backfires on him i
[1:30:55] hope this morning you can find out one
[1:30:57] thing god is real
[1:31:02] a real god with a real message with a
[1:31:04] real purpose and he has a purpose for
[1:31:06] your life you're not here by
[1:31:10] [Applause]
[1:31:14] accident well you don't know brother
[1:31:17] timothy my family didn't even plan my
[1:31:18] coming there
[1:31:20] it just happened god planned it
[1:31:23] [Applause]
[1:31:24] they may not have planned it but god
[1:31:26] planned it
[1:31:28] god put it there
[1:31:31] god placed it there
[1:31:33] god placed you here listen do you know
[1:31:35] how many i i can't even count the odds
[1:31:41] of being born in a home that believes a
[1:31:43] message
[1:31:44] could have been born in a million
[1:31:46] billion different homes
[1:31:48] at a million billion different times
[1:31:51] but god chose to put you here
[1:31:54] amen
[1:31:56] and not only did he choose to put you
[1:31:58] here he would watch over your
[1:32:01] fathers and grandfathers great
[1:32:02] grandfathers all he would watch over
[1:32:04] them through wars and watch over them
[1:32:06] through wrecks and watch over because
[1:32:08] there was a seed that had to come
[1:32:09] through
[1:32:11] he was zealous over you he was watching
[1:32:13] over you he was preparing for you he
[1:32:16] wanted you
[1:32:18] oh hallelujah if you can get that
[1:32:20] revelation god wants me
[1:32:23] he desires me he wants me he wants my
[1:32:26] fellowship he wants my love he wants my
[1:32:29] abilities he wants everything i have
[1:32:32] [Applause]
[1:32:38] there's so many devices
[1:32:41] satan's devices
[1:32:42] as i said it gets you by yourself and
[1:32:44] makes you think nobody else cares about
[1:32:46] you
[1:32:47] nobody understands and nobody's worried
[1:32:49] about your situation everybody's
[1:32:51] laughing everybody's making fun and
[1:32:53] meanwhile everybody's praying for you
[1:32:57] but that's not what the devil wants you
[1:32:58] to know
[1:33:00] he wants you to make you think when
[1:33:01] somebody looks at you and turns away he
[1:33:04] wants to make you think at that moment
[1:33:05] oh i knew they had a problem with me
[1:33:08] no they just all of a sudden thought of
[1:33:10] something else and needed to go take
[1:33:11] care of something had nothing to do with
[1:33:13] you
[1:33:15] that's the devil's device
[1:33:18] and i know with young people we want to
[1:33:19] be accepted
[1:33:22] come on now be honest
[1:33:25] we want to be accepted
[1:33:27] we want to want to be loved and cared
[1:33:30] for and
[1:33:31] thought of and
[1:33:32] we desire that
[1:33:36] won't we want approval
[1:33:39] and sometimes parents don't give it
[1:33:42] they don't ever give that because
[1:33:44] somehow some reason there's a problem
[1:33:45] there and they can't show the real love
[1:33:46] they ought to show as a father and
[1:33:48] mother or whatever grandmothers whatever
[1:33:51] they can't they can't show that
[1:33:52] sometimes and it causes a problem on the
[1:33:55] inside of that child because they never
[1:33:56] heard i love you they never heard amen a
[1:33:59] real had to hug or had a moment where
[1:34:01] they never had those moments and it
[1:34:03] causes a thirst and a hunger and the
[1:34:05] first thing you know the devil enters in
[1:34:07] and he starts turning that towards the
[1:34:08] wrong things
[1:34:09] [Applause]
[1:34:11] and they're chasing after this approval
[1:34:12] and that approval and they get it and
[1:34:14] they got to go to somewhere else to get
[1:34:15] another approved one they get it they
[1:34:16] got to go somewhere else they're never
[1:34:18] satisfied because there is a longing
[1:34:20] there but if they could ever take a
[1:34:22] third or take a drink amen from the well
[1:34:25] of god
[1:34:26] that thirst has been on the inside of
[1:34:28] you you thought you was thirsty for
[1:34:30] drugs you thought you was thirsty amen
[1:34:32] for a woman you thought you was thirsty
[1:34:34] for this that and the other no what you
[1:34:35] really been thirsty for is a drink from
[1:34:38] the eternal well of almighty god if you
[1:34:40] could ever get a drink amen oh taste and
[1:34:43] see that the lord is good and his mercy
[1:34:46] endureth forever he wants to fulfill
[1:34:48] every desire of your heart
[1:34:52] [Applause]
[1:34:54] amen
[1:34:55] one time in the scripture after the
[1:34:56] death of ahab one of israel's most
[1:34:58] wicked kings his son hezekiah followed
[1:35:02] him on the throne he have one of the
[1:35:03] most wicked but his son has hezekiah one
[1:35:06] day he was walking in his upper porch
[1:35:07] and he fell through lattice and he hurt
[1:35:09] himself and he took some sort of disease
[1:35:12] and then he called two of his men and
[1:35:13] sent them over to ekron to the god of
[1:35:16] bells above to consult his prophets
[1:35:19] was he going to recover or not
[1:35:22] and elijah the tishbite being a true
[1:35:24] prophet of god the holy spirit came to
[1:35:26] envision said go stand in the way he
[1:35:29] said see god will block your way
[1:35:32] now listen to statement it's not easy to
[1:35:35] go to hell
[1:35:37] it's hard to go to hell
[1:35:41] oh man well i thought straight i thought
[1:35:44] wide was the way
[1:35:46] prophet god said it's not easy he said
[1:35:48] god will try to block you every part
[1:35:52] he'll try to stop you he'll try to turn
[1:35:54] you he'll try to be there he'll send a
[1:35:57] preacher your way he'll send this one
[1:35:58] that one he'll do whatever it takes
[1:36:01] amen god sends his messengers he sends
[1:36:04] prophets he sent his gospel he makes his
[1:36:06] church a flaming fire and men constantly
[1:36:08] fight right over he sends it out on the
[1:36:10] waves or the radio or television he
[1:36:12] sends the published word he sends it
[1:36:14] from lip to ear and men are constantly
[1:36:17] walked right over it he said but god
[1:36:19] sends it anyhow why would you go to
[1:36:21] echoing the bells above when because
[1:36:23] there's no prophet in israel is there no
[1:36:24] god there that's the reason people today
[1:36:27] go deliberately to drunken parties and
[1:36:30] dances at night gamble cheat try to make
[1:36:32] a lot of money is it because is it
[1:36:34] because there's no pleasure in god
[1:36:38] wow
[1:36:40] is it because there's no no pleasure in
[1:36:42] god and the very reason that you thirst
[1:36:45] for that is because you are rejecting
[1:36:47] god
[1:36:50] god made a man to thirst but to thirst
[1:36:53] after him
[1:36:55] but after you turn that down the devil
[1:36:57] tries to satisfy that thirst with
[1:36:59] drinking or smoking or gambling or
[1:37:01] things on your phone it's because we
[1:37:03] haven't got a holy spirit is it because
[1:37:05] we ain't got a holy spirit that brings
[1:37:07] joy it's is it because that there's no
[1:37:10] satisfaction it's christ is it in christ
[1:37:14] that you seek those things is that why
[1:37:16] you're going after it but i'm telling
[1:37:17] you there is satisfaction in christ
[1:37:20] there is joy unspeakable and full of
[1:37:23] glory
[1:37:24] hallelujah this joy can be given to you
[1:37:27] i've got a joy that the world didn't
[1:37:29] give and the wall can't take away
[1:37:33] hallelujah i got a word that the world
[1:37:36] didn't give and the world can't take
[1:37:38] away
[1:37:39] [Applause]
[1:37:41] hallelujah i wonder how many young
[1:37:43] people will say i got something that the
[1:37:45] devil didn't give and for the devil
[1:37:47] can't take it away
[1:37:49] [Applause]
[1:37:50] hallelujah
[1:37:54] is it because
[1:37:56] that there's not something there is
[1:37:57] there no pleasure
[1:37:58] in serving christ
[1:38:01] is that the reason men do what they do
[1:38:04] he said why they would continually drink
[1:38:06] and then go to church for recovering
[1:38:12] have you never tasted the lord yet
[1:38:14] you've never known how good he is
[1:38:16] if a man ever come to the fountain
[1:38:18] filled with blood
[1:38:20] drawn from emmanuel's veins
[1:38:22] plunged beneath that swirl plunged
[1:38:25] beneath that the sins of the world and
[1:38:26] all the devil could offer
[1:38:29] would be as dead as midnight
[1:38:32] it's because they refuse to do it is
[1:38:34] because they refuse to receive the holy
[1:38:37] spirit god's bomb it reminds me of a man
[1:38:40] dying on the doctor's doorsteps a man
[1:38:43] die
[1:38:44] because he refused to take the remedy
[1:38:46] for his disease if the doctor's got a
[1:38:48] remedy for your disease and you say i
[1:38:50] won't take it you could sit on his
[1:38:51] doorstep close to it and you'd still die
[1:38:54] because you refused to remedy don't then
[1:38:56] don't lay it on the doctor he's got the
[1:38:59] remedy you need to lay it on your
[1:39:01] stubbornness not to receive it
[1:39:04] it wasn't because there wasn't no god in
[1:39:06] israel it wasn't because there wasn't no
[1:39:08] prophet there it was because the king
[1:39:10] was too stubborn he hated the prophet he
[1:39:12] said that's what's the matter with today
[1:39:14] there's no there's satisfaction there's
[1:39:16] healing for soul body and christ but the
[1:39:19] people are too stubborn
[1:39:22] that's right
[1:39:24] amen well brother timothy i wanted to
[1:39:26] shout in service well we're getting
[1:39:28] there
[1:39:30] that's the reason they die in their sins
[1:39:33] on the church steps
[1:39:36] sitting right on church pews it wasn't
[1:39:38] because there wasn't a remedy it was
[1:39:41] given every service
[1:39:43] come yet to the lord come and seek him
[1:39:45] come and find him and it was pleading
[1:39:48] and pleading and pleading
[1:39:50] you know
[1:39:51] we like i said we had goats goat we get
[1:39:54] sick
[1:39:56] my dad was almost as he was really the
[1:39:58] vet would have to call him sometimes to
[1:40:00] see what to do for a goat he was pretty
[1:40:02] well
[1:40:03] well versed in taking care of goats
[1:40:07] and uh some some of the preachers
[1:40:08] started giving him a hard time about
[1:40:09] that said well i said preachers have
[1:40:11] goats and he said i figure every
[1:40:12] preacher has pastored a few goats
[1:40:16] but you know you'd see a goat sick
[1:40:18] and you would so would kind of kind of
[1:40:20] look at it and say well
[1:40:22] his ears are dropped drooping down it's
[1:40:25] kind of hunched over is he's got
[1:40:28] he needs a needs a dose of this or that
[1:40:30] and you go draw it up in the medicine
[1:40:31] and pull it up in a syringe or he's
[1:40:33] going to give it a shot or sometimes you
[1:40:34] put it down their throat and you know
[1:40:36] what that goat didn't have a choice
[1:40:39] he'd go out there and he'd say hey son i
[1:40:41] need you to give that one a shot it's
[1:40:42] got this and i need you to do this i'd
[1:40:44] walk over there and i'd grab that goat
[1:40:46] and i'd either put his head between my
[1:40:47] leg whatever i had to do
[1:40:49] give it to them open their mouth pull it
[1:40:50] up and give it down their throat that
[1:40:52] goat didn't have a choice that's the
[1:40:54] difference between you and a goat the
[1:40:56] pastor can see that you're sick
[1:40:59] they can see when things ain't going
[1:41:01] good you say well i'm okay well you're
[1:41:02] not you might hide it as me and might
[1:41:04] hide it from your mom and daddy but
[1:41:05] you're not ever hiding it from the
[1:41:06] spirit of almighty god
[1:41:08] god will anoint a man and he'll show him
[1:41:10] things and he'll show that there's
[1:41:12] sicknesses inside of you and he'll begin
[1:41:14] to study on something and begin to
[1:41:15] preach and it will play it all out there
[1:41:17] but the choice is he can't come over
[1:41:20] there and grab you around the throat and
[1:41:21] say take it
[1:41:24] no you have to take it for yourself you
[1:41:26] have to say god that is me i see myself
[1:41:29] there and i'm going to accept that
[1:41:31] remedy so i don't have to die of this
[1:41:33] disease
[1:41:35] amen there is a disease that's going out
[1:41:37] through the land and it's worse than
[1:41:39] kobe had ever thought about being it's a
[1:41:41] layover seeing flu and it's killing
[1:41:44] people by the thousands
[1:41:47] why not because there wasn't no remedy
[1:41:49] there is a holy ghost that'll put it up
[1:41:51] put them above laodicea and above the
[1:41:53] things of the world and above all the
[1:41:55] things are going on but they refuse it
[1:42:03] pleasures of sin are for a season
[1:42:08] it's only for a moment
[1:42:10] wow if i could just marry that girl
[1:42:12] it's only for a moment
[1:42:15] or if i could just get that job
[1:42:18] it's only for a moment
[1:42:20] oh if i could just do that
[1:42:23] it's only for a moment
[1:42:29] you may live in the best house
[1:42:32] you might

[1:42:40] you might be the most popular you might
[1:42:42] be the king of the party the life and
[1:42:45] the fun of your group but you'll never
[1:42:48] be satisfied

[1:42:53] the holy spirit
[1:42:55] that's god's toxin
[1:42:59] that's the only thing that'll work
[1:43:01] that's the only one thing see he said
[1:43:03] the number one killer in the land is not
[1:43:05] heart disease
[1:43:06] as we're told the number one killer is
[1:43:08] sin disease
[1:43:10] the disease of sin is killing the world
[1:43:13] he said i often made this statement it
[1:43:14] isn't the robin that pecks the apple
[1:43:16] that kills the apple it's the worm in
[1:43:18] the core that kills the apple it isn't
[1:43:21] communism that's killing america it
[1:43:22] isn't other nations that's polluting
[1:43:24] this nation it's the sin in the nation
[1:43:26] that's polluting itself it's the
[1:43:28] immorals of the people and
[1:43:31] thousands those are called christian
[1:43:32] binary and the world sees them no
[1:43:34] different in them than any other person
[1:43:36] therefore christianity
[1:43:38] has become so weak

[1:43:45] what do you mean i'm a christian
[1:43:47] talk to a man you know smoking a
[1:43:49] cigarette and you ask them don't you

[1:43:58] just any day i'm gonna go he said when
[1:44:01] that rapture comes

[1:44:03] i'm gonna go in the rapture
[1:44:06] everybody's a christian
[1:44:09] because christianity has become so weak
[1:44:18] people have begun to real not even
[1:44:19] realize anymore as the boy we read in
[1:44:21] the bible they're naked and they don't
[1:44:23] even know it
[1:44:26] their minds have become so overcome by
[1:44:28] spirits
[1:44:29] they can walk out before you naked
[1:44:31] brother brahma said it's going to get so
[1:44:32] bad
[1:44:35] and it's becoming more and more
[1:44:37] prevalent
[1:44:38] and it's becoming more and more
[1:44:39] prevalent in our churches and and
[1:44:41] and things and dresses and not listen it
[1:44:44] ain't just girls it's boys too
[1:44:48] listen it ain't just girls that needs to
[1:44:50] hold a standard it's boys too
[1:44:53] but now we got it where it's cool for a
[1:44:55] boy to go get a perm and get curly hair
[1:44:57] what that that's becoming a
[1:45:00] that's not cool that's becoming styles
[1:45:03] of the world
[1:45:05] where'd you pick it up at you know i had
[1:45:07] a boy one time that was asking me about
[1:45:09] wearing shorts i had a wrong wear shorts
[1:45:11] i can go through all the quotes i can do
[1:45:12] this and i can do that ain't wrong
[1:45:14] wearing shorts he said what do you think
[1:45:16] about it i said well why are you asking
[1:45:18] me you already got your mind made up
[1:45:21] that's what my thoughts were
[1:45:23] but i thought you know i'll i'll pray
[1:45:25] about it and i'll come talk to you
[1:45:27] so i went in prayer about it and i was
[1:45:29] like you know he gave me all of his the
[1:45:30] whole list of quotes he had found and he
[1:45:32] had his all of his reasonings of how it
[1:45:34] used to be shorts were up here and now
[1:45:36] they're down here and all this kind of
[1:45:37] stuff and and i i just went and started
[1:45:40] praying about it and he had made this
[1:45:42] statement he said i just think you
[1:45:43] wouldn't maybe think that this was just
[1:45:44] brother branham's opinion
[1:45:46] i was like man i get i get you get on
[1:45:48] some very treacherous grounds when you
[1:45:49] go down that ray road
[1:45:51] so i'm praying about it and i ask god
[1:45:53] what kind of answer can i give this boy
[1:45:55] lord what can i or this young man what
[1:45:57] can i do what where what where can i
[1:45:59] what what can i say i i don't even know
[1:46:01] and all of a sudden it's dropped in my
[1:46:03] heart said if it's just his opinion ask
[1:46:06] him what influenced that opinion
[1:46:12] i got to thinking about it could it be
[1:46:14] that what influenced if you want to just
[1:46:16] call the things these kind of things are
[1:46:18] the message just brother branham's
[1:46:19] opinion could it be amen that it was the
[1:46:22] angel of god that visited him night
[1:46:24] after night that might have had an
[1:46:26] influence on what just his opinion
[1:46:30] therefore if that's so what and you have
[1:46:32] a different opinion let me ask you the
[1:46:34] question what's influence in your
[1:46:36] opinion
[1:46:37] [Applause]
[1:46:39] is it hollywood is it things you're
[1:46:40] looking at is it pads and fashions of
[1:46:42] the world what is influencing what you
[1:46:45] do
[1:46:46] [Applause]
[1:46:50] the zeal of my father's house
[1:46:52] he wants a clean vessel he wants clean

[1:47:10] sit on the front pew right there and i
[1:47:12] would raise my hand but just as sinful
[1:47:14] as i could be but one day god came on
[1:47:16] the scene for me and i met him
