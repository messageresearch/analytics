[34:35] in the testimony I heard for sister

[34:39] fantastic and I just heard brother
[34:40] bandam say that you know people say that
[34:43] all things are possible with God and he
[34:44] says no all things are possible with you
[34:47] you know that's the truth right it's all
[34:48] things are possible to us we just have
[34:50] to have that Revelation you know that
[34:52] it's it's with us and I was thinking of
[34:54] her testimony and praying for herself
[34:57] and and and so forth and I remembered a
[34:59] story I'd heard years ago about AA Allen
[35:01] that somebody had asked him to go visit
[35:04] uh uh a woman's sister that had I guess
[35:07] she was demon possessed for a better
[35:09] lack of term there you know today we put
[35:11] all kinds of different terminologies on
[35:12] it but she was deemly possessed and so
[35:15] he arranged a time to come to her house
[35:17] and he went to her house and she was
[35:19] waiting on him a car pulled up and said
[35:21] outstep a Allen he's all white dressed
[35:24] in a white suit white shoes everything
[35:27] White come walking up the door and she
[35:29] opened up the door brother Allan so good
[35:31] to see you he said where is she you know
[35:33] no greetings nothing and her sister was
[35:36] sitting at the dining room table there
[35:40] just out of her mind didn't know where
[35:42] she was at a and walked over and bent
[35:44] over and whispered something in her ear
[35:45] and she snapped herself just like that
[35:47] and turned around walked out well the
[35:50] woman wanted to know what did you
[35:52] say some of you may have heard this
[35:54] story said devil this is AA Allen
[35:59] and sometimes we got to realize who we
[36:02] are and the authority that God has
[36:04] invested in us right amen amen I think
[36:08] sometimes we're a little bit timid on
[36:09] approaching the things but I appreciate
[36:11] sister T's testimony or brought that
[36:13] back to to my memory but God Is A Healer
[36:16] the same yesterday today and forever and
[36:18] nothing is too hard for him and like I
[36:19] said it's certainly good to be back here

[40:30] uh asked me do you have any plan to
[40:33] travel brother
[40:35] Mario and I said I don't have any plan
[40:38] because I've been in the Philippines for
[40:41] 15 months right so I need to stay here a
[40:44] little bit
[40:45] longer but I don't put a period in it
[40:49] because when I said as I'm getting older
[40:52] I don't know how to plan anymore I just
[40:55] leave it to the Lord and whever he leads
[40:58] me then I would just follow so I've been
[41:02] traveling last month and also this
[41:05] month with been in Hawaii with my uh
[41:10] mother-in-law uh she's a t
[41:13] magara and she has uh 16
[41:17] kids so I think if I'm not mistaken
[41:20] sister josephin is number six in the 16
[41:24] is that is that right so she is now 86
[41:29] years old and she's a great testimony of
[41:33] the faith of God in his life
[41:36] faithfulness just uh uh an
[41:41] inspiration to each and every one of us
[41:44] amen at 86 he still
[41:48] longing
[41:50] uh just this day uh we told her you can
[41:54] just stay home and just listen because
[41:56] if you can and that you know if you
[41:58] don't feel good no I'm going to church I
[42:01] am going to work so praise the Lord so
[42:03] it's an encouragement and it's good to
[42:06] to be with her amen so praise the Lord
[42:11] tonight and may the Lord uh bless us as
[42:14] we turn our Bible in the Book of John
[42:28] chapter 16 we'll uh begin in verse
[42:32] 12 and
[42:37] 13 it's good to be in the house of the
[42:39] Lord tonight amen it's really
[42:42] different uh when you are in a a live
[42:45] service together with the Saints amen
[42:48] you just can feel the the the presence
[42:51] the leak of fire that each ones brings
[42:53] amen so we are expecting that the holy
[42:57] spirit will come and just anoint the
[42:59] word and just stimulate our heart in the
[43:04] word John chapter 16 verse 20 uh verse
[43:08] 12-13 it says I have yet many things to
[43:12] say unto you but you cannot bear them
[43:16] now because God know the season of your
[43:19] life to reveal his truth to you amen so
[43:22] in verse 13 how be it when he the spirit
[43:26] of Truth truth is
[43:28] come he will guide you into all truth
[43:32] yes for he shall not speak of himself
[43:35] but whatsoever he shall hear that he
[43:38] shall speak and he will show you things
[43:40] to come amen so showing things to come
[43:43] is a prophetic Ministry and we know that
[43:46] we are living in that age right now so
[43:49] turn with me in the Book of Revelation
[43:51] chapter
[43:55] 4 verse one
[44:01] and after this I look so after this it
[44:06] means after the seven Church ages has
[44:08] run out because in Revelation chapter 3
[44:11] the door was
[44:12] closed so in chapter 4 There Was An Open
[44:15] Door and behold the door was
[44:18] opened not on Earth but in heaven and
[44:22] the first voice which I heard was as it
[44:25] were a trumpet talking with me which
[44:28] said come up here and I'll shoot the
[44:32] things which must be Hereafter so this
[44:36] open door was opening of the word that
[44:39] came by the voice of the seventh angel
[44:41] and this door was a door that stood
[44:43] between the Lan and the bright age
[44:49] dispensation so it an Open Door it give
[44:51] us an entrance from Lan Church age into
[44:54] a bride age dispensation amen so an Open
[44:59] Door will give us will bring us
[45:01] somewhere sir because it's an Open
[45:04] Door praise be God so Revelation chap 10
[45:08] verse 7 a very common
[45:13] scripture but in the days of the voice
[45:15] of the sevenant Angel when he shall
[45:18] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[45:20] be finished as he had declared to his
[45:23] servant the prophet and may the Lord had
[45:26] the bless upon the reading of his word
[45:29] so I will uh title this sermon you may
[45:31] be now see title the sermon when the
[45:35] spirit of Truth is
[45:37] come so before we go to the subject
[45:41] tonight I will just like to read the
[45:43] message is this the sign of the
[45:47] end so it is a question but we know that
[45:50] the answer is in the context of the
[45:54] question now listen close the seventh
[45:56] angel of Revelation 10:7 is the seven
[45:59] Church a
[46:02] messenger so he quote that in the days
[46:04] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[46:06] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[46:08] God should be finished now the sounding
[46:12] forth this message the seventh angel
[46:14] here is sending forth his message to the
[46:17] loudan age notice his type of message
[46:21] now it wasn't to the first Angel second
[46:24] third fourth fifth six but it is in the
[46:27] seventh
[46:29] angel that had this type of message and
[46:32] what type of message was seventh
[46:35] angel his type of message is finishing
[46:38] all the mysteries of God that was
[46:42] written in the
[46:43] book the seventh angel is winding up all
[46:47] the Mysteries that's lay loose ended all
[46:51] out through this organization and
[46:53] denomination the seventh angel gathers
[46:56] them up
[46:57] and finishes the entire mystery and
[47:00] that's what the Bible said finishes The
[47:02] Mystery of the written
[47:04] book so this seventh angel the type of
[47:08] message is winding up all the loose
[47:11] end so there are a lot of mysteries
[47:14] around the seventh angel but this
[47:15] ministry of the seventh angel is to
[47:17] gather those lose
[47:19] ended and reveal the
[47:22] mystery now let's note a few of these
[47:26] Mysteries
[47:28] and if you want to write it down first
[47:29] I'll take what scopel say here in
[47:31] Matthew Chapter 13 so he's using the
[47:35] scopel uh Bible with the references
[47:38] under Matthew Chapter 13 who
[47:42] knows Matthew Chapter
[47:45] 13 I know you know it but when randomly
[47:49] questioned your mind is still
[47:53] progressing what what what is that but
[47:55] we know that Matthew you know it and
[47:58] it's the parable of the sore of the seed
[48:00] amen
[48:04] so all the people gathered together and
[48:07] he told them things in Parables yes
[48:11] parable of the S of the seed he spoke to
[48:13] them many parables and some seed fall to
[48:16] the roadside and the birds so it so we
[48:19] know each and every one of that but it's
[48:21] good to be
[48:23] reminded ad fell on the rocky ground
[48:25] other Fells upon the thorn horns and
[48:27] other fell on good ground and yield
[48:30] fruit and he ended up with he that had
[48:33] an ear let him hear
[48:37] amen so before he quot verse 11 in verse
[48:42] then all the disciple cames to him and
[48:46] asked him why speakest thou in
[48:50] Parables so if we don't know anything
[48:53] about the word we need to come to Jesus
[48:55] Christ and ask
[48:59] if you cannot understand the word you
[49:01] need to ask it will not come to you if
[49:04] you don't ask because you need to seek
[49:07] Him amen first the kingdom of God seek
[49:09] him and you shall find him if you cannot
[49:13] understand the message of the hour I
[49:14] encourage you to read the Bible read the
[49:16] spoken word and when the preacher stand
[49:18] and preach you know exactly where he's
[49:20] going but if you don't read the
[49:23] scripture you don't listen to the
[49:24] message of the hour there's always a
[49:27] question mark in your
[49:32] faces but if you read and hear the
[49:34] message every time a preacher stand here
[49:37] you are in great
[49:39] anticipation knowing that God will
[49:41] always speak to his people amen so they
[49:44] are asking why do you speak in Parables
[49:48] so Jesus Christ answered he answered and
[49:50] said unto him
[49:52] because it is given
[49:57] to
[50:01] you his disciples to
[50:04] you because it is given to you to know
[50:08] the mystery of the kingdom of
[50:10] God but to them it is not
[50:14] given so there are two kinds of people
[50:17] to you the mystery is given to
[50:21] you so given means
[50:24] granted you don't work your
[50:27] way to receive this
[50:30] Revelation it was given it was granted
[50:33] it was bestowed and it is the gift of
[50:36] God knowing alone who you are Hallelujah
[50:40] it give you con confidence it give you
[50:44] strength and you will know no matter
[50:46] what happened in this life do too many
[50:48] tries and testing you know exactly where
[50:50] are you going because he said I am the
[50:54] beginning and I am the ending he knows
[50:56] what you're beginning and he knows what
[50:57] your ending to you it is given to know
[51:01] but to them it was not given amen so
[51:05] what is the difference between you I we
[51:08] and
[51:11] them when it comes to the Physical
[51:15] Realm we are all the
[51:20] same we are born in sin come to the word
[51:23] speaking lies nothing good about us
[51:26] amen yes we have a judgment that the
[51:30] wages of sin is
[51:32] death but by his for knowledge he has an
[51:35] elected people a chosen people it's not
[51:38] by our works it's not by our ability
[51:40] it's not our status in life but by his
[51:43] election he has chosen you Hallelujah
[51:46] before the foundation of the word and he
[51:48] is obligated to reveal the secret
[51:51] mystery that was hidden before the
[51:54] foundation of the world to you it is
[51:56] even to know and you need praise God to
[52:00] claim that you is you tonight why are
[52:02] you in the church tonight because God is
[52:04] going to reveal to you his
[52:08] will because knowing who you
[52:12] are as brother Ron preached last Sunday
[52:15] knowing who you
[52:18] are even when he preached the Myster of
[52:20] Christ revealed when someday when you
[52:22] know who you are then the Rapture will
[52:24] go it's not by by our ability but our
[52:28] struggle by how much we achieve or know
[52:31] our memorize the
[52:33] scripture but it was by revealing by
[52:36] knowing who you
[52:37] [Applause]
[52:42] are knowing alone who you are will give
[52:46] you
[52:49] confidence so it's not looking at the
[52:51] flesh because if we are looking at the
[52:54] flesh no one can be saved
[52:58] amen but God is not looking at the flesh
[53:01] he's looking at his
[53:04] election those who elected before the
[53:06] foundation of the word many are called
[53:09] but few are chosen and you are the
[53:12] Chosen Few to receive the message of the
[53:14] hour many are rejecting the message of
[53:16] the hour and along the way they at first
[53:18] they receive the message of the hour but
[53:20] along the way they're ready hello
[53:22] forsaking the message of the hour but
[53:25] not you
[53:27] you are still here in the midst of your
[53:29] struggle in the midst of your trial in
[53:31] the midst of so much Hallelujah
[53:33] confusion around the message of the hour
[53:35] you are still staying and looking for
[53:38] the re for the revelations of the word
[53:40] of God there is still life bubbling in
[53:42] your heart looking for more of a
[53:45] revelation of the word of God because
[53:47] God is obligated to reveal to
[53:50] you but to them
[53:52] Hallelujah it was hidden because they
[53:56] have ear to hear but they could not hear
[53:59] but they can eye to so this is what
[54:01] brother Ron is praying before we come
[54:03] out of this because before we come out
[54:06] of the pulpit we pray there and he pray
[54:09] that he mention something like that the
[54:11] par speaking Parables and the Mystery
[54:14] was hidden to them but for the bride it
[54:17] is being revealed Hallelujah and we know
[54:21] that he continue here's the mystery a
[54:24] mystery IAH there's a lot of mystery in
[54:26] this world that we can never know and
[54:29] sometimes it blows our mind that mystery
[54:32] that no one can explain about it just
[54:35] like a simple mystery why a cow face
[54:37] North and South while eating
[54:42] grass even science are baffled by
[54:47] that some of the scientist just notice
[54:50] in the Google Earth while they Google it
[54:52] they come up with a cow are facing north
[54:54] or south while eating grass and they
[54:56] cannot explain
[55:01] it and somehow white flowers are growing
[55:08] everywhere and animals some animals can
[55:11] live without
[55:13] oxygen that's that's just a
[55:18] mystery and the other one is how the
[55:21] Argentine ants sustain a colony across
[55:24] three continent
[55:26] the Argentine a the red
[55:30] Aunt they can be found in Europe South
[55:33] America and
[55:35] Asia how did they come to that we don't
[55:39] know and even the prophet said that even
[55:42] the sexual reproduction is more
[55:45] mysterious than the Virgin
[55:49] birth but we are not concerned about
[55:51] this mystery of the word but we want to
[55:54] know is the mystery which is hidden in
[55:57] the word of
[55:59] God he said the mystery is a scripture
[56:02] previously hidden
[56:04] truth now divinely revealed but which is
[56:09] a supernatural element still remain
[56:12] despite the Revelation and the greater
[56:14] mystery and the great mystery are so he
[56:17] summarized all this mystery that is
[56:19] being gathered in the last
[56:23] days so is this the time is is the sign
[56:26] of the answer so in paragraph
[56:30] 31 he enumerated all the mystery but I
[56:35] don't need to read it to you tonight for
[56:38] the sake of time but I encourage you to
[56:40] read
[56:41] it and make it
[56:43] your devotion by reading those mystery
[56:46] that he
[56:48] mentioned in the scripture but I want to
[56:51] jump on paragraph
[56:54] 31:2 for our subject so enumerated it
[56:59] and in paragraph 31:2 that some of the
[57:03] Mysteries that this Angel is supposed to
[57:05] wind up all the mysteries of God and I
[57:08] may say this with
[57:09] reverence and not refering myself but
[57:12] referring to the angel of God the
[57:15] serpent SE that's been hidden Mystery
[57:17] all through the years the grace
[57:19] strengthen out not this Grace but real
[57:21] true Grace and brother Steven preaches
[57:23] beautifully during that time amen no
[57:26] such thing as Eternal burning hell to
[57:29] all these Mysteries praise God you'll
[57:31] burn for million of years but anything
[57:33] that was eternal had never beginning or
[57:36] end and hell was created for all these
[57:39] Mysteries so my subject tonight is this
[57:41] one the mystery of the baptism of the
[57:44] Holy Ghost without
[57:46] sensation but the person of Christ
[57:50] performing in you the same works that he
[57:53] did so this will be my subject to
[57:56] tonight
[57:57] and this is one of the Mysteries that we
[58:01] are told we would be known to the end
[58:04] time by the seventh angel but yet it's
[58:07] very misunderstood
[58:09] subject so may God help us to see it
[58:11] clearly as taught by the seventh Angels
[58:14] message and Sometimes When We Touch
[58:17] about certain
[58:18] subject sometimes we are become nervous
[58:22] as if it's so it's so we are walking in
[58:25] a danger Dangerous
[58:28] Ground but we know a message believ the
[58:30] prophet tell us that all the mystery
[58:32] when God reveal it he always reveal it
[58:35] in
[58:36] simplicity so let us calm down and
[58:41] relax we are in a good you are in a good
[58:45] hand not in the hand of brother Mario
[58:48] but in the hand of God tonight so in
[58:51] Revelation 4:1 it speak this door that
[58:54] was open in heaven took place at the
[58:56] junction of time between the Pentecostal
[58:59] age and the bride age and the bright a
[59:02] dispensation of the time that we as
[59:05] believer are living in right now so
[59:07] since the opening of The Seven Seals in
[59:09] 1963 it is important that we recognize
[59:12] the junction of the message of when
[59:15] doctrinal changes took place from
[59:18] Pentecostal Lan Church a teaching to a
[59:21] bride age teaching although brother
[59:24] brother Ron already the
[59:26] uh teach about this
[59:28] subject but it's good to
[59:31] be
[59:33] reminded because a lot of people as as
[59:36] they go on the message of the hour they
[59:39] are uh little by little are going away
[59:42] from the real truth of the message of
[59:44] the hour but it is good to be
[59:47] reminded the direction of the message
[59:50] believer are
[59:51] going in different
[59:54] direction even in the the Old Testament
[59:56] when the messenger was out of the
[59:59] picture the people began to worship
[1:00:02] different kinds of
[1:00:05] gods then God sent another Messenger to
[1:00:08] correct them and go back to the world
[1:00:10] again then after 40 years when The
[1:00:12] Messengers pass away then they go back
[1:00:16] another to a denominational belief then
[1:00:18] God send another Messenger to return
[1:00:20] them back that that is how God is so
[1:00:24] gracious to each and every one of us we
[1:00:27] fail but he never failed Hallelujah we
[1:00:30] can run away from the presence of God
[1:00:32] but he will keep on moving and direct us
[1:00:35] because when the Holy Spirit come upon
[1:00:37] us he will guide us he will direct us he
[1:00:40] will lead us into all
[1:00:43] truth that's why it's good to be
[1:00:45] reminded of the word of God and so this
[1:00:48] is very important for us to understand
[1:00:50] that when brother bham stated or started
[1:00:53] as a young Minister he didn't know
[1:00:54] everything from the begin
[1:00:58] meaning so when we mentioned about
[1:01:01] brother bham didn't know anything or
[1:01:04] didn't know everything a lot of eyebrow
[1:01:08] are going
[1:01:10] up what a prophet didn't know
[1:01:13] anything he was a prophet we know that a
[1:01:16] prophet was born a prophet but a
[1:01:18] prophet was
[1:01:21] born our gifts and callings are without
[1:01:24] repentance he was born to to be a
[1:01:26] prophet but the Revelation is a
[1:01:29] progressive
[1:01:31] revelation just like when we are born we
[1:01:34] are born a baby we become an infant we
[1:01:36] become a child become a teenager
[1:01:38] adolescent is so Progressive even in the
[1:01:41] Book of Genesis when God created the
[1:01:43] Heaven and Earth and there was Darkness
[1:01:45] God said let there be light let there be
[1:01:48] let there be let there be let there be
[1:01:50] so it's a progression of the revelation
[1:01:52] of Jesus Christ
[1:01:57] he began his ministry with many things
[1:02:00] in his own understanding because we know
[1:02:03] that he started as a Baptist
[1:02:06] Minister as he always had a testimony
[1:02:08] that I got my
[1:02:10] teaching as much I I
[1:02:15] could
[1:02:19] scripturally that needed to strengthen
[1:02:21] out by the real truth of the word and so
[1:02:23] there was a junction along the way in
[1:02:24] his ministry when the real true light of
[1:02:26] the revelation of these hour was
[1:02:28] revealed and became clear to him and
[1:02:31] that is also our
[1:02:33] experience as we walk with the Lord in
[1:02:35] the light of the message of the hour we
[1:02:38] didn't know everything when we receive
[1:02:40] the message of the hour but along the
[1:02:42] way God is trying to reveal little by
[1:02:45] little progressively little by
[1:02:48] little because the message is
[1:02:51] Progressive amen there are so many
[1:02:53] issues many issues that we struggle with
[1:02:57] when we first come to the message of the
[1:02:59] hour but by God's grace when the Holy
[1:03:02] Spirit Come he reveals little by little
[1:03:05] progressively until we come into the
[1:03:08] maturity of the word of God there is no
[1:03:15] shortcut we cannot say oh I am old in
[1:03:18] the message I've been in the
[1:03:21] message not that's not a qualification
[1:03:26] the qualification is how much you humble
[1:03:29] yourself in the presence of God the more
[1:03:32] you humble yourself the more God reveal
[1:03:34] himself to you it's not by how long
[1:03:37] you've been in the message how many
[1:03:39] messages you you
[1:03:42] read even if you receive the message of
[1:03:44] the hour and receive Christ and you
[1:03:45] humble yourselves and ask God to reveal
[1:03:48] he will reveal it to you and S the
[1:03:52] revelation of those who just start are
[1:03:54] better than those who
[1:03:57] are been in the message for so long
[1:04:01] sometime they've been in the message for
[1:04:02] so long but the end of the day they
[1:04:04] reject the message of the hour so it's
[1:04:07] not a guarantee how long you are in the
[1:04:09] message it's all by the grace of God he
[1:04:12] will reveal to whom he wants to reveal
[1:04:15] it and so because of this when people
[1:04:18] come into the message from Pentecostal
[1:04:19] background they will naturally bring
[1:04:23] their Pentecostal understanding over
[1:04:25] with them
[1:04:26] so we have the saying that they came out
[1:04:28] from
[1:04:29] denomination but their denomination
[1:04:32] didn't come out from
[1:04:33] them especially in the Philippines when
[1:04:36] there was a mystery Expo and and maybe
[1:04:39] 30 or 40
[1:04:42] denominational preachers are attending
[1:04:45] the message and when the message was
[1:04:47] expounded they were so excited that what
[1:04:51] they hear they didn't hear it in their
[1:04:53] denominational School and they readily
[1:04:56] accept the message of the hour and they
[1:04:59] began to preach along the
[1:05:02] way they see thousands maybe hundred of
[1:05:05] coats that support their Pentecostal
[1:05:13] view so any kind of Doctrine you can get
[1:05:15] quotes from Brother
[1:05:17] Braham and it creates sometimes
[1:05:22] confusion among the church because the
[1:05:25] direction that they are going into is
[1:05:28] still in their denominational
[1:05:30] understanding of the message of the
[1:05:35] hour so a lot of that is happening maybe
[1:05:38] not only in the Philippines May some
[1:05:40] other countries those who receive the
[1:05:41] Pentecostal message and they receive the
[1:05:43] message and they preach the
[1:05:47] message in the long run they don't know
[1:05:51] what direction they are going into amen
[1:05:54] and they encourage
[1:05:57] people to have this sensation and
[1:06:00] feelings the first and second pull of
[1:06:03] the ministry of brother B to attract the
[1:06:06] attention of so many
[1:06:07] people but that is not the message of
[1:06:10] the
[1:06:13] hour so but when they start out in the
[1:06:17] message they are looking at the message
[1:06:20] mostly through their eye of
[1:06:21] denominational or Pentecostal background
[1:06:24] religious bre
[1:06:26] so that's why they can preach the
[1:06:28] message and quote the message th to
[1:06:31] support their
[1:06:36] views that is why they are able to find
[1:06:39] maybe thousands of quotes in the message
[1:06:42] that will seemingly allow them to preach
[1:06:44] a Pentecostal teaching of the Holy
[1:06:48] Spirit of byan lisian
[1:06:51] age within this new land of the message
[1:06:54] of the hour
[1:06:56] but they are still
[1:06:57] using and quoting the prophet's
[1:07:02] message yet the prophet tell us in many
[1:07:04] places in the message that we have to
[1:07:06] die out to that understanding in order
[1:07:09] to come into the bright
[1:07:12] age the message the anointed one at the
[1:07:14] end
[1:07:17] time in paragraph 158 he said the life
[1:07:20] keeps advancing on but remember it's in
[1:07:23] another stage it can't in that stage we
[1:07:27] can't eat the Carion of other
[1:07:33] ages we can't eat Pentecostal
[1:07:37] Carion Methodist or Baptist it's become
[1:07:40] a Carion we have press food the word of
[1:07:43] this hour and Carion means decaying
[1:07:46] flesh of dead animals and also known as
[1:07:50] carcass
[1:07:52] we we have a fresh
[1:07:56] food in this hour so the real fact is
[1:08:00] that in the message of the hour you can
[1:08:01] find quotes to support almost kind of
[1:08:04] false teaching that you could
[1:08:07] imagine just like what has been done
[1:08:09] with the Bible over the period of
[1:08:12] time and we have seen a lot of
[1:08:14] throughout the years but the true bride
[1:08:15] will be not be
[1:08:18] deceived because she will be guided by
[1:08:20] the Holy Spirit of the inner teacher
[1:08:23] that is leading her through that mind
[1:08:25] field of this false
[1:08:27] teaching that's why the bride cannot be
[1:08:31] deceived impossible but that is very
[1:08:35] impossible because the bride is part of
[1:08:38] the groom and we have the Holy Spirit
[1:08:41] that will lead us and guide us and
[1:08:43] direct us into all truth
[1:08:45] amen so we have to come to realize that
[1:08:48] breham been start out knowing it all at
[1:08:51] the
[1:08:52] beginning you can stumble all you can
[1:08:55] but we believe that he didn't know
[1:08:58] everything at the beginning of his
[1:09:00] ministry it was just by the grace of God
[1:09:03] he need to
[1:09:05] experience the scripture that he's
[1:09:08] reading in his life just like us we need
[1:09:11] to experience every word of
[1:09:17] God and the lack of this understanding
[1:09:19] is what caused many to become confused
[1:09:21] over the years with certain teaching of
[1:09:23] the message because when we read the
[1:09:25] message it is important for us to
[1:09:27] understand that the revelation of this
[1:09:29] hours was first a journey of progressive
[1:09:33] revelation it is a journey to the
[1:09:35] prophet himself as the Lord will reveal
[1:09:37] certain truth to him along through the
[1:09:40] season and experience of his
[1:09:43] life that's why he can preach boldly
[1:09:47] because he know all the scripture he
[1:09:50] experiened through his
[1:09:52] life we all know that he was born a
[1:09:54] prophet
[1:09:56] as I say that gifts and callings are
[1:09:58] without repentance but the revelation of
[1:10:01] the word of this hour had to be revealed
[1:10:03] to him progressively by
[1:10:07] God and so as the word came to him then
[1:10:10] it corrected many errors of doctrine
[1:10:13] that he may have had because of his own
[1:10:15] human
[1:10:17] understanding and this is God's pattern
[1:10:19] for us also in our experience of Life as
[1:10:22] we walk with the truth of this hour the
[1:10:24] same experience with our
[1:10:30] Prophet as we go along with the
[1:10:33] Scripture it became pler and clearer and
[1:10:38] clearer amen so there were certain
[1:10:40] Pentecostal doctrine that were corrected
[1:10:43] as the message Advance by the opening of
[1:10:46] the mystery being revealed in our day
[1:10:49] yes but when a person would come out of
[1:10:51] Pentecost Church background into the
[1:10:53] message then they would still be able to
[1:10:55] find hundred of goates of the message
[1:10:57] that would allow them to preach
[1:10:58] Pentecostal Doctrine concept of baptism
[1:11:01] with the Holy Ghost as a message
[1:11:02] Doctrine yet the prophet clearly tell us
[1:11:04] that we are not to bring the doctrine of
[1:11:06] the Pentecostal age over into the new
[1:11:10] land of the bright age yes we have
[1:11:13] something
[1:11:14] different and we need to recognize that
[1:11:16] in the message the invisible Union of
[1:11:19] the bride of Christ the word that fell
[1:11:22] on the day of Pentecost will not work
[1:11:24] this days
[1:11:25] yes no sir that was for the Pentecost
[1:11:28] and this is for the bride going home of
[1:11:31] the Bride we got something different the
[1:11:34] Pentecostal represent that again so he's
[1:11:37] referring to the asusa Street Experience
[1:11:40] praise God of the Pentecostal age again
[1:11:44] we are in the bright age so we are in
[1:11:46] the age we are in the different age no
[1:11:49] more than the word of Noah would work in
[1:11:51] the days of Moses no more than Moses law
[1:11:53] would work in the time of Paul he tried
[1:11:56] to tell them you are dead to that and
[1:11:58] you cannot have that so brother Bram is
[1:12:01] tell us that this mystery of baptism
[1:12:03] with the Holy Ghost without sensation
[1:12:05] would be one of mysteries that he would
[1:12:07] be revealed in this last
[1:12:11] age because in the message is this the
[1:12:14] end of time sir he said the mystery of
[1:12:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:12:18] sensation but the person of Christ
[1:12:21] performing in you the same work that he
[1:12:23] diden amen so what is the work of Christ
[1:12:29] yes so the work of Christ was he
[1:12:31] fulfilled scripture that were written of
[1:12:34] him for that hour and that was the work
[1:12:36] that he
[1:12:37] accomplished remember that there are 47
[1:12:40] major prophecy fulfilled in the life
[1:12:45] of our Lord Jesus
[1:12:47] Christ that's why when he walk in the in
[1:12:50] Luke chap 24:25 after his resurrection
[1:12:54] he meet with the disciples
[1:12:56] then he said unto them oh fools and slow
[1:12:58] of heart to believe all the prophets
[1:13:00] have
[1:13:02] spoken oh not Christ to have suffer
[1:13:04] these things and enter into
[1:13:06] glory and beginning at Moses and all the
[1:13:10] prophets he expounded unto them in all
[1:13:12] the scripture the things concerning
[1:13:14] himself amen beginning at Moses and
[1:13:18] Moses wrote five of the books Genesis
[1:13:20] Exodus theoy Leviticus praise God and
[1:13:23] some beginning at Moses in the Book of
[1:13:26] Genesis then all the prophets from
[1:13:29] Isaiah Samuel Daniel Zechariah Malachi
[1:13:32] and Son all those prophecies fulfilled
[1:13:35] in his life am so is the work that he is
[1:13:39] doing not only the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:41] Ghost without sensation but the person
[1:13:43] of Christ and what is the person of
[1:13:46] Christ the revealed
[1:13:47] word in the day that we are living in he
[1:13:51] is performing the revealed word praise
[1:13:54] God in he said that that was the work
[1:13:57] that he
[1:13:58] accomplished amen amen the word being
[1:14:02] made manifest and so at the end time the
[1:14:04] Bride of this hour this is what also
[1:14:06] called to
[1:14:08] accomplish as he accomplish the
[1:14:10] scripture prophecy pertaining to himself
[1:14:12] then as a bride of Jesus Christ we have
[1:14:14] scripture and works to do and that is to
[1:14:17] accomplish the the prophecy that pertain
[1:14:19] to
[1:14:21] us there are so many scripture that
[1:14:23] pertains to the Bride of Jesus CH and
[1:14:25] one example can be seen in Genesis
[1:14:27] chapter 24 Rebecca is the typ of the
[1:14:30] bride and IL there is a type of brother
[1:14:33] Braham that it introduces to the Unseen
[1:14:37] groom Isaac which is a type of
[1:14:41] Christ Hallelujah there must be a
[1:14:43] Rebecca if there is a Rebecca there must
[1:14:45] be an elisher that will introduce her to
[1:14:48] the Unseen brid Grom reaches the Lord
[1:14:50] Jesus Christ part
[1:14:55] we are to buit Genesis Chapter
[1:14:58] 18 Hallelujah and God appeared unto them
[1:15:01] and discern the heart of Sarah and
[1:15:03] Abraham and that scripture fulfilling
[1:15:05] our day amen the word of God made flesh
[1:15:08] and discern our spirit in these last
[1:15:11] days hallelujah and we also to fulfill
[1:15:13] the time of Easter coming into the
[1:15:16] marriage Union after B they rejected the
[1:15:19] King which is titled Pentecostal they
[1:15:22] rejected the invitations of the king yes
[1:15:26] Hallelujah and was put away by refusing
[1:15:28] to come into the Pres of being SE
[1:15:30] refused to be his word b they loud as
[1:15:33] here they close the door and God is
[1:15:36] knocking
[1:15:37] them so we are to also to fulfill the
[1:15:40] type of Bruth at the Harvest Time who
[1:15:43] came into Union with Bo as the L of
[1:15:45] harvest and also Rahab at the time of
[1:15:49] judgment with the token
[1:15:51] display who married salmon at the end
[1:15:53] time all this problem y they are the
[1:15:56] supernatural element yes although there
[1:15:59] a Mysteries being revealed this is the
[1:16:01] supernatural stories element in the
[1:16:04] scripture Hallelujah that we can see
[1:16:07] ourselves in the scripture
[1:16:10] amen and all the scripture must be La
[1:16:13] out in this hour by by an elected end
[1:16:15] time
[1:16:17] people this is a prophecy there must be
[1:16:20] a people to leave it out who are those
[1:16:23] people you are those people
[1:16:25] amen amen and so this the work that
[1:16:28] Christ is performing in the lives of the
[1:16:31] elected bride of Jesus Christ these are
[1:16:33] the supernatural element prophecy
[1:16:36] stories for this day that Christ was
[1:16:39] being writing in the story of your life
[1:16:44] amen Rebecca meting elizer the prophet
[1:16:48] and introducing us to ISA which is
[1:16:50] Christ in this life
[1:16:55] and so this is the third pool Ministry
[1:16:57] of this hour which is the word of this
[1:17:00] day being interpreted in human flesh
[1:17:03] again this is not the first pool the
[1:17:05] second pool by by Emotion by attracting
[1:17:09] uh the public this is the third pool
[1:17:12] which is revealing directly in private
[1:17:16] through the Bride of Jesus
[1:17:18] Christ and this is a greater than what
[1:17:21] the Pentecostal loud this year produced
[1:17:25] this isn't just baptism of the anointing
[1:17:28] of the Holy Ghost falling on people but
[1:17:30] this is the person of Christ fulfilling
[1:17:33] end time scripture through an elected
[1:17:37] people and so this is where the real
[1:17:39] Supernatural work of God has been taking
[1:17:42] place among the people of God Amen this
[1:17:46] is not just about
[1:17:47] anointing but this revealing of the
[1:17:50] person of Christ to every
[1:17:53] believer but if you only have a
[1:17:55] Pentecostal denominational
[1:17:57] interpretation of what it is to do the
[1:17:58] words of Jesus by trying to copy some
[1:18:01] historical event and you try to bring
[1:18:04] that idea from the loudan side of the
[1:18:07] door and over into this bright side of
[1:18:09] the door then you try to mix that old
[1:18:11] Mana o byan age in the truth of the
[1:18:14] message of the hour then it won't long
[1:18:19] before you will encouraging the people
[1:18:22] to look back to the the first and second
[1:18:25] full experience of a platform
[1:18:28] performance of an outward Supernatural
[1:18:32] attraction
[1:18:34] am so we need more
[1:18:38] Revelation and then all you do is bring
[1:18:40] confusion into the message and we see a
[1:18:42] lot of them
[1:18:46] today the direction of the message of
[1:18:48] the hour is going back into the first
[1:18:51] and second pool
[1:18:56] that's why when the spirit of Truth is
[1:18:58] come he will guide us into all
[1:19:04] truth and brother bham Ministry but we
[1:19:07] know that the first and second Ministry
[1:19:09] of stages performances and big crowd has
[1:19:12] now passed that's right we are beyond
[1:19:16] the first and second pool yes of
[1:19:19] attracting thousands of
[1:19:21] people we believe in healings and
[1:19:23] Ministries all that Revival in the in
[1:19:26] the spirit we believe that but as the
[1:19:29] Bride of Jesus Christ we are
[1:19:31] beyond the feeling of Sensations to the
[1:19:34] word that is being revealed in our day
[1:19:37] we need to have a clear understanding of
[1:19:40] the hour and the day that we are living
[1:19:42] in and recognize who we are because to
[1:19:46] you it is given to know the mystery of
[1:19:49] God God is obligated to reveal to you
[1:19:53] his hidden Mystery
[1:19:56] he was not trying to bring you to a
[1:19:59] sensation by feelings or emotion or
[1:20:01] sensation is trying to bring you to the
[1:20:04] word of the hour and that word will
[1:20:07] manifest again in the
[1:20:10] flesh we know that the first second full
[1:20:13] ministry of stage performance and big
[1:20:15] has now passed because we are now living
[1:20:17] in the bright age of the third po of the
[1:20:19] prophet's Ministry of where the spirit
[1:20:21] of Christ is now dealing
[1:20:25] privately with his bride under a
[1:20:28] supernatural
[1:20:31] administration of revealing of himself
[1:20:34] by the opening of the word and of which
[1:20:37] there is no public show
[1:20:45] involved amen that's why we can oh we
[1:20:47] are not Vindicated because we cannot see
[1:20:49] speaking Tong we cannot see healings we
[1:20:51] cannot see Miracles that is not the
[1:20:54] basis
[1:20:57] the basis is you have a clear
[1:20:59] understanding of the word of the
[1:21:01] hour
[1:21:03] Allelujah amen all this mystery the M
[1:21:06] mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:08] without sensation but the person amen of
[1:21:12] Christ performing in you the same works
[1:21:15] that he
[1:21:17] did the word that was being made
[1:21:19] manifest in Jesus Christ once again will
[1:21:22] manifest to his bride he will perform it
[1:21:25] once again in our
[1:21:27] lives that's why my brother and sister
[1:21:30] this is a personal
[1:21:32] revelation if we look at our physical
[1:21:35] flesh no one can be saved am because all
[1:21:39] of us are we we all have
[1:21:42] shortcomings that's why the message
[1:21:43] should be our is being
[1:21:47] revealed because the revelation of the
[1:21:50] world will create rupturing
[1:21:53] Faith that's right
[1:21:55] amen we can only be ruptured by the
[1:21:58] revelation of the word of God not by our
[1:22:01] works in the flesh because if we look at
[1:22:04] the flesh no one will be in the
[1:22:06] rupture there why the prophet said the
[1:22:09] revelation of knowing who you are then
[1:22:11] the Rapture will go knowing who you are
[1:22:14] because flesh and blood cannot inherit
[1:22:16] the kingdom of God even though how much
[1:22:18] we clean it we take about every day but
[1:22:22] the next day we take about again
[1:22:24] because there's this dirty flesh you
[1:22:27] canot clean how much you toothbrush how
[1:22:29] much you clean it but the next day you
[1:22:30] clean it
[1:22:32] again even though how much you struggle
[1:22:35] to be to be to be good to be clean to no
[1:22:38] no no no no just believe the word that's
[1:22:42] the only thing that he wants you to do
[1:22:43] believe the word because we cannot do
[1:22:46] anything within our lives praise God the
[1:22:48] thing that he has done it is done it is
[1:22:51] finished I paid it Allen
[1:22:54] I only required you to believe the word
[1:22:58] now to struggle to be perfect because
[1:23:00] Perfection is in the revealed word of
[1:23:02] the hour if you believe the revealed
[1:23:04] word is perfect then you are perfect as
[1:23:11] well so the mystery of the baptism of
[1:23:14] the Holy Ghost without sensation but the
[1:23:15] person of Christ performing in you the
[1:23:18] same work that he did so we want to look
[1:23:20] a little bit deeper into the mystery as
[1:23:24] thought by the message of the hour and
[1:23:25] she proven it by the word as the Bible
[1:23:28] truth Amen in Matthew 5:45 I don't know
[1:23:32] if I can finish this but I I I try to
[1:23:35] that ye may be children of your father
[1:23:37] which is in
[1:23:39] heaven for he maketh his son to rise on
[1:23:43] the evil and on the good and sendeth
[1:23:45] rain on the just and the
[1:23:49] unjust so in the message the anointed
[1:23:52] one at the end time when he preached in
[1:23:54] 19 65 brother bam tell us that this
[1:23:57] Reign represent the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:59] Ghost yes a genuine baptism of the Holy
[1:24:03] Ghost
[1:24:06] yes that fell on both the just and the
[1:24:09] unjust and so this was a teaching that
[1:24:12] was a great Shack to the Pentecostal
[1:24:16] word of which the Propet mostly is
[1:24:20] preaching
[1:24:20] to that's right because it seems so
[1:24:23] contrary to what the Pentecostal church
[1:24:26] had always thought and
[1:24:29] believed they made such a major point on
[1:24:32] this baptism of the Holy Spirit and now
[1:24:35] they are being told that it will fall on
[1:24:37] the both sinner yeah and the
[1:24:41] saint right it is a great
[1:24:44] check genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:48] can fall to the Sinner and to the Saint
[1:24:50] at the same time
[1:24:52] yes and so this was such a great
[1:24:55] contrast to their Pentecostal
[1:24:57] understanding of being the third work of
[1:25:00] Grace So in
[1:25:03] 1965 there was this Junction of
[1:25:07] truth that was being sent by God to
[1:25:09] correct the Pentecostal error of
[1:25:14] understanding God is revealing
[1:25:16] progressively to the
[1:25:19] prophet so we need to have this
[1:25:22] understanding or else we can just
[1:25:24] compare quotes by quotes fighting quotes
[1:25:27] by quotes that's right but the prophet
[1:25:29] said even though how much
[1:25:32] quot we use when we preach the absolute
[1:25:35] is still the word of
[1:25:40] God as the prophet said my absolute is
[1:25:44] the word of
[1:25:46] God before we are born before Jesus
[1:25:49] Christ was born before brother Braham
[1:25:51] was born the scripture was already done
[1:25:55] but there is certain time in this age
[1:25:59] that we need to realize something is
[1:26:01] happening in our age so in 1965 there
[1:26:05] was a junction of Truth was being sent
[1:26:08] by God to correct the Pentecostal error
[1:26:10] of understanding and so all of a sudden
[1:26:12] brother abam seems to change the concept
[1:26:15] of what we always thought was The
[1:26:17] Ultimate
[1:26:19] Security of when a person received the
[1:26:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:24] anointing that sealed them into the day
[1:26:26] of redemption yes but then from July 196
[1:26:30] my brother bham begin to make statement
[1:26:34] about the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:26:36] seems almost completely
[1:26:39] opposite to what he had taught at the
[1:26:42] time yes modern events made clear by
[1:26:47] prophecy notice we find today that
[1:26:50] people there's many people just can't
[1:26:53] believe it
[1:26:56] so in this upper paragraph is he talking
[1:26:59] about the the the the
[1:27:02] healing and he said and know we find
[1:27:04] that people there is many people just
[1:27:05] can't believe it's even spirit filled
[1:27:10] people even spirit filled
[1:27:14] people many people just can't believe it
[1:27:17] even spirit filled people you can be
[1:27:20] Spirit-filled
[1:27:22] but if you don't have have the
[1:27:25] truth you are on the other side yes if
[1:27:28] you have the truth and you don't have
[1:27:30] the spirit you are on the other side
[1:27:33] that's why we are always in the middle
[1:27:36] of the road he said we it is now time
[1:27:39] for us to worship Him in spirit and in
[1:27:42] truth because they my word they are
[1:27:44] spirit and they are
[1:27:48] life notice that he is saying that even
[1:27:51] spirit filled people can believe the
[1:27:53] true word this
[1:27:55] hour I'm going to give you one that'll
[1:27:58] choke
[1:28:00] you the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't
[1:28:03] mean you're going
[1:28:06] in not at
[1:28:08] all this will choke the Pentecostal
[1:28:11] group of
[1:28:12] people
[1:28:14] amen this is a hard
[1:28:17] saying why suddenly he changed he didn't
[1:28:20] change it by his own but it was the Holy
[1:28:23] Spirit corrected him
[1:28:27] not all that don't have anything to do
[1:28:29] with your soul that's the
[1:28:31] baptism notice this Junction of
[1:28:34] truth of the word here of how that
[1:28:36] brother bam own understanding had began
[1:28:38] to see with a clearer Crystal
[1:28:41] understanding that there was difference
[1:28:43] between the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:45] on the spirit of a person and the person
[1:28:48] of the Holy Ghost of the revelation of
[1:28:51] the word for their day in a person's
[1:28:53] soul amen so there's a difference the
[1:28:56] anointing in the spirit of a man and the
[1:28:59] revealing of the person of Christ to the
[1:29:01] soul of men so the person of the Holy
[1:29:04] Ghost is the revelation of the word for
[1:29:06] your day which come by the spirit of God
[1:29:09] leading you progressively into the full
[1:29:12] word of your hour amen and this is in
[1:29:16] contrast to the Pentecost and
[1:29:18] understanding of the anointing of the
[1:29:19] Holy Ghost Reign that comes by and is
[1:29:22] recognized by the Association with
[1:29:24] feeling feeling
[1:29:27] and
[1:29:29] sensation so there is a
[1:29:31] contrast what is the baptism of the
[1:29:34] anointing of the Holy Ghost that anoints
[1:29:35] your whole human
[1:29:37] spirit that anointing is not fake anoint
[1:29:40] the genuine anointing of the Holy
[1:29:44] Ghost and brother bam bring scripture to
[1:29:48] back it up yes because the rain falls to
[1:29:51] the just and the
[1:29:53] unjust and the others the baptism of the
[1:29:56] person of the word what is the person of
[1:29:59] the word it was
[1:30:01] Christ by the Revelation in your soul so
[1:30:04] do you see the difference others the
[1:30:06] word of the person of the Holy Spirit
[1:30:09] himself revealing to you the truth of
[1:30:11] this hour to your soul by Leading you
[1:30:13] into truth of your day
[1:30:15] without
[1:30:17] sensation of the
[1:30:20] anointing maybe you're are sitting there
[1:30:22] where the preaching is preaching
[1:30:24] it just quicken in your soul and you
[1:30:27] recognize it was God himself speaking to
[1:30:29] your heart without any sensation or
[1:30:32] emotion that you feel it just the word
[1:30:34] that was spoken and Quicken into your
[1:30:36] heart and you can say Amen to the word
[1:30:39] of
[1:30:42] God the preacher is not trying to
[1:30:44] encourage you to feel something and be
[1:30:48] no no we just speak the
[1:30:51] word and if it's the word of this day it
[1:30:53] will will kick into your heart if you
[1:30:55] are part of this word you will say Amen
[1:30:57] to the word because you are responding
[1:31:00] to your
[1:31:02] [Applause]
[1:31:05] theop and so the language Changs of the
[1:31:07] concept from a Pentecostal age thinking
[1:31:10] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to a
[1:31:13] bright age thinking of the word being
[1:31:14] revealed by the spirit of God
[1:31:19] yes so let
[1:31:21] us make this this clear
[1:31:25] you can be
[1:31:27] silenced and listen
[1:31:29] carefully you do not need the baptis of
[1:31:32] the Holy Ghost to be saved and go to
[1:31:36] [Music]
[1:31:38] heaven because we know that the foolish
[1:31:41] virgins never receed the Holy Ghost
[1:31:43] baptism of the oil in their lamb and yet
[1:31:47] they are saved and can have eternal
[1:31:51] life yes
[1:31:55] they asking for o give us more oil we
[1:31:58] have enough they don't have enough oil
[1:32:00] in their
[1:32:01] day they have oil but enough in their
[1:32:05] age they have don't have any oil to go
[1:32:09] through but for the Bride of Jesus
[1:32:11] Christ we are
[1:32:13] equipped and there are souls under the
[1:32:16] altar of the Jew in the fifth seal in
[1:32:18] Revelation 6 that are saved and they
[1:32:20] never receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:22] Ghost
[1:32:26] and one in Matthew chapter 25 who are
[1:32:28] good to the bride and they can have
[1:32:30] eternal life and never have the baptism
[1:32:32] of the Holy Ghost yet they have eternal
[1:32:36] life so the message of the
[1:32:39] hour is so
[1:32:41] clear amen it is not a cult that we can
[1:32:45] say oh we are the only we are the only
[1:32:47] Bri no no no there are a lot of
[1:32:50] scripture
[1:32:51] pertains right but there are scripture
[1:32:53] for the
[1:32:55] bride there's scripture for everybody
[1:32:57] because God so loved the world that he
[1:33:01] gave his only begotten son that
[1:33:04] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:33:06] perish but come into eternal life God is
[1:33:09] so gracious that he is not willing that
[1:33:12] anyone should perish but come into
[1:33:15] repentance but for the bride we are
[1:33:17] special class of
[1:33:20] people we are not become boastful of it
[1:33:23] but it's by God's grace and we are bold
[1:33:26] enough to claim I am an elected of God
[1:33:30] because my life
[1:33:36] changed and then on top of this
[1:33:39] understanding the prophet of this
[1:33:40] generation teaches that you can actually
[1:33:43] receive the genuine baptism of the
[1:33:45] anointing of the Holy Ghost and go on to
[1:33:48] be lost yes
[1:33:53] a lot of
[1:33:55] question but thank God we have a prophet
[1:33:58] in these last days that the ministry is
[1:34:01] to wind up all those
[1:34:02] loen gather together all those loen that
[1:34:06] create confusion and division Among Us
[1:34:09] and reveal the truth that's why when the
[1:34:11] Holy Spirit truth is come he will guide
[1:34:14] you into all
[1:34:15] truth in the message leadership the
[1:34:18] outward expression show exactly what on
[1:34:20] the inside the kak many of you think I
[1:34:22] got the baptism of the the Holy Ghost
[1:34:24] I'm going to heaven and many are
[1:34:26] claiming that I got the baptism of the
[1:34:28] Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven I spoke
[1:34:30] with tongue I have sensation I see a
[1:34:32] vision I
[1:34:36] saw that don't mean one thing that
[1:34:39] you're going to heaven yes that's hard
[1:34:43] say wow no sir you can have the baptism
[1:34:47] of the Holy Ghost every hour in your
[1:34:50] life yes and still be lost and go to
[1:34:53] hell
[1:34:54] yes the Bible said
[1:34:58] so so he is now beginning to make
[1:35:00] statement like this because he is seeing
[1:35:03] with this with greater Clarity than he
[1:35:06] had ever seen it before yes that the
[1:35:09] genuine Holy Spirit reain falling on
[1:35:13] someone is just that it's just an
[1:35:16] anointing that can fell on person human
[1:35:21] Spirit but this does not change the seed
[1:35:24] of what the person is inside their
[1:35:28] soul Hallelujah so PR is making it clear
[1:35:33] and so that is why you could have the
[1:35:35] true baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[1:35:37] hour in your life and you can still be
[1:35:40] lost but when the same Holy Spirit
[1:35:43] revealed the word for your day to you
[1:35:46] then that word is the person himself
[1:35:49] coming into you the very person of the
[1:35:52] word of eternal life
[1:35:56] himself he is never doing away with the
[1:35:59] anointing of the Holy Ghost but he is
[1:36:01] trying to show that if that is all you
[1:36:05] haveen just the anointing on your spirit
[1:36:08] realm then that is insufficient in this
[1:36:12] bright
[1:36:14] age because if you have the wrong
[1:36:16] teaching of the word in your
[1:36:20] heart then you will eventually become a
[1:36:24] false anointed
[1:36:26] one anointed by the spirit of
[1:36:31] God but if the word is not yet
[1:36:34] revealed you can be anointed one false
[1:36:37] anointed one at the end
[1:36:39] time we all believe in the power of God
[1:36:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost on wi no
[1:36:44] one is ever doing away with
[1:36:48] it but we are not to make the anointing
[1:36:51] of the spirit our soul object and focus
[1:36:55] because that was the old Pentecostal
[1:36:57] lisian age teaching but we are to make
[1:37:01] the revelation of the word of this hour
[1:37:04] our object yes of focus yes amen the
[1:37:10] empasis in this hour has moved from the
[1:37:14] rain to the seed amen that's why in the
[1:37:18] message the the seven Church ages when
[1:37:21] brother Braham
[1:37:25] inspired by the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:37:26] Ghost speak unto him take up your pen
[1:37:29] and write
[1:37:31] amen and send it to the church the same
[1:37:35] holy ghost that tell John the Beloved in
[1:37:40] the Book of Revelation amen when the
[1:37:42] seven Thunder out their voices and when
[1:37:45] he was about to write the same holy
[1:37:47] ghost that tell brother take the pen and
[1:37:49] write the same holy ghost that tell John
[1:37:51] do not write this John
[1:37:55] right because it was prepared for the
[1:37:57] seven Church ages messenger so when the
[1:38:00] seven Church ages messenger take thy pen
[1:38:02] and write and send it to the church and
[1:38:05] the brother quoted Revelation 11 let
[1:38:08] every seed bring forth of its SK the
[1:38:12] empasis is not the rain but the emphasis
[1:38:14] on the word the seed you need to
[1:38:17] recognize that if you are the sin of God
[1:38:20] it is written it is spoken so shall it
[1:38:23] be done
[1:38:24] no one can take away the Revelation that
[1:38:26] was already spoken whether you like it
[1:38:29] or not the time and season of your life
[1:38:31] will recognize your day and it message
[1:38:34] you cannot run away from it because the
[1:38:37] Holy Spirit take your pen and right and
[1:38:39] send it to the church we have the
[1:38:42] message of the
[1:38:43] hour Hallelujah the identification is
[1:38:47] not on the anointing but on the
[1:38:49] revealing of the word that you are the
[1:38:51] seed of God in this last day whether you
[1:38:54] like it or not the anointing was already
[1:38:56] spoken and it will Quicken the seed if
[1:38:59] you're are the seed of God it will bring
[1:39:03] forth the manifestation of whatever seed
[1:39:06] you are in you are the seed of God Amen
[1:39:11] then expect to be Quicken one of these
[1:39:13] days you may struggle you may run away
[1:39:15] from this word but it was already spoken
[1:39:18] and it shall be done whether you like it
[1:39:19] or not the time and season in your life
[1:39:22] will come that you will recognize and
[1:39:25] return to the word of God because it was
[1:39:27] already
[1:39:28] [Applause]
[1:39:30] spoken let every seed bring forth to be
[1:39:34] kind
[1:39:37] Hallelujah so I would like to read it he
[1:39:41] say here's what I'm trying to say the
[1:39:42] law of reproduction is that each species
[1:39:45] bring forth of its own kind even
[1:39:46] according to Genesis
[1:39:48] 1:1 and God said let the Earth bring
[1:39:51] forth grass and herbul in seed and the
[1:39:53] fruit yielding fruit after his kind
[1:39:55] whose seed is in itself upon the Earth
[1:39:58] and it was
[1:39:59] so whatever life was in the seed came
[1:40:02] forth into a plant and Dan into a fruit
[1:40:05] we can see the progression of the seed
[1:40:08] from seed to plant to fruit yes
[1:40:11] sir the very same law applies to the
[1:40:14] church today whatever seed started the
[1:40:18] church will come forth like the Original
[1:40:20] Seed because it is the same seed
[1:40:23] in the last day the true church Christ
[1:40:26] sin that is your identification whatever
[1:40:30] seed was planted in the day of Pentecost
[1:40:33] will be the same seed that will be in
[1:40:35] theia because he said I am the alpha I
[1:40:38] the Omega what he started he will finish
[1:40:42] it it is not by your doing but it twice
[1:40:45] doing it for his chch I am the alpha
[1:40:49] what I have
[1:40:50] begin I will finish it at the end
[1:40:54] it is
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:40:57] done yes sir in this last day the true
[1:41:00] church Christ
[1:41:02] SE will come to The Headstone and she
[1:41:05] will be a super Church super raise as he
[1:41:07] nears him
[1:41:11] yes am
[1:41:15] don't underestimate
[1:41:18] yourself I cannot make it so it's not
[1:41:20] for you to make it right he has already
[1:41:23] done
[1:41:24] it you have nothing to do but believe
[1:41:27] what he has done in your life he knows
[1:41:29] the end from the beginning whatever
[1:41:31] things that comes our way it works out
[1:41:33] for our good to them who love
[1:41:36] him you are a super race it is a
[1:41:40] declaration don't belittle yourself
[1:41:42] don't look at your shortcoming because
[1:41:44] shortcomings will always be here but the
[1:41:48] message of the hour you are a super race
[1:41:50] and you need to stand and claim it I am
[1:41:53] the the super
[1:41:55] race not because you are good in the
[1:41:57] flesh because you struggled because you
[1:41:59] have a status in this life no because
[1:42:02] you believe the
[1:42:03] word and that is our standard the word
[1:42:06] of God word because he is the one who's
[1:42:10] doing it
[1:42:12] all we are the seed planted before the
[1:42:14] foundation of the world and she will be
[1:42:17] the Super chair super r that she near
[1:42:19] him they in the bride will be so much
[1:42:22] like him yes amen wo they will even be
[1:42:25] in his very
[1:42:30] image so don't look at your shortcomings
[1:42:33] today I cannot make it no listen to what
[1:42:36] he
[1:42:37] said not to what you feel right not the
[1:42:41] way you judge yourself right but judge
[1:42:44] yourself in your heart how much you
[1:42:47] embrace the word of
[1:42:49] godallah that is the main purpose in
[1:42:51] this life not our status in life not our
[1:42:54] because when we go over there we cannot
[1:42:57] bring anything from this word whatever
[1:42:59] character we have right
[1:43:02] now when this body change will still the
[1:43:05] same character if you are a doubter of
[1:43:07] his word you will be a doubter there if
[1:43:09] you are believer this word you will be a
[1:43:10] believer and as a Believer you have no
[1:43:14] option no maybe it's what if no maybe no
[1:43:18] if you are a Believer you believe

[1:48:49] he comes out with statements like that
[1:48:52] and he says it watch you you can have
[1:48:56] the spirit on your spirit prophesy
[1:49:00] activate the gifts of the Spirit and he
[1:49:03] said but it's not in the
[1:49:05] soul once you are baptized by the holy
[1:49:09] ghost in the holy of
[1:49:12] holies and the word sits upon the throne
