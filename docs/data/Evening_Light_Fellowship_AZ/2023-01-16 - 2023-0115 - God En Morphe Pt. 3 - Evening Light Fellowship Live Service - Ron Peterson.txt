morning certainly enjoyed the song specials God bless them let's just remain standing all of you have been greeted let me just go directly into the service but each and every one but I saw Vicki Buckingham God bless her she snuck in here amen this uh scripture there in Deuteronomy is is quite astounding Deuteronomy 10 verse 17. for the Lord your God is God of Gods okay your God somebody say my God [Applause] you see you got to make it personal my God is the god of God there are many gods and there are many lords but my God is the god of Gods for the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords a great God a mighty and a terrible which regardeth not persons nor taketh reward turn with me to First Corinthians now First Corinthians chapter 8. verses 5 through 6. for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or or in earth as there be God's many and Lord's many but to us there is but one God amen hallelujah I get excited when I read stuff like that because the Bible says yeah look there's many gods and if you've traveled around the world you've been to places like India Africa or whatever you will see there are multitudes of Gods but there is a God of Gods ah but they're but to us there is but one God the father of whom are all things and we in him and our Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things and we by him can you say Amen to that yes turn back with me Romans chapter 8. Romans 8 verses 14 through 19. for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children than heirs Heirs of God and join ears with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed where is it going to be revealed in US the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature wadeth for the manifestation of the sons of God can you hear it they're saying come on come on amen if you're listening the spirit of God is wooing each one every son and daughter of God to get into their position may God add the blessing the reading of his word you can be seated this morning in God's presence brother Brennan took that one scripture there of talking about the creation growneth and waited for the manifestation of the sons of God he said he preached a whole sermon on it called birth pains and he said what it is all that you're seeing in the world today and all that is happening from earthquakes to blackouts to tsunamis to all of those things he said what it is is the Earth is tremoring she's convulsing she's ready to bring forth a whole another world that's why this kingdom is fracturing it's all falling apart it's got to praise God be we have a kingdom that cannot be shook Jesus said clearly my Kingdom's not of this world Hallelujah I'm glad I'm a citizen of another kingdom brother Bram said that's why here you don't have it so easy you got to be tested and tried amen every son and daughter of God is going to be tested and tried to see really what is your Revelation made of amen I'm going to continue on I'm going to try to finish this uh thought uh that God has been dealing with me on but then I'm going to launch out actually you know on brother Paul Halen God bless you it's good to have you here but every Minister knows your sermon never really finishes because what what God does is he keeps unfolding and you go from one Revelation to another Revelation to another revelation and so uh even as God is unfolding to you and even as the word unfolds to the minister what happens uh I mean I could probably title this this is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever part 3625 uh because what it is it's a never-ending story Hallelujah in fact I tell you how Eternal it is brother Brenham said God is so great that it will take an eternity for God to reveal himself and so what you are catching is just the tip of the iceberg we can't fathom how great he is but he's almighty God and he is great for sure okay we're titling this God in Martha part three God in Martha part three and I'll take the subject this morning of Christ in you becomes a manifested son or daughter so we're talking about manifested Sons we're talking about that God has sent a message here in this day that's going to help you come to the stature of a perfect man that stature is Christ amen so we realize then if I could use these word what God is doing he's cloning himself he's actually taking this this Fallen people and restoring them and redeeming them back to what they were before now if you were never before you will never be after let that sink in because brother Branham said if you are a son of God if you ever have been or ever will be it's because you were in the mind of God in the beginning and he says and so you really have no choice now yes you choose but let me say this you think that you were seeking God is seeking you God came down looking after you God came to you you didn't come to him amen so I want to continue this thought of God in morpha and how that God changes his masks down through all the ages now sometimes we have a hard time understanding how God changes his mass and how he does it but brother Branham says that God is the great author of life he's the author of this book and he wrote a part to play for everyone from Adam to the last sea and so now he has orchestrated this since the foundation of the world he knew who would and who would not because he's author can clay say unto the Potter why have you made me thus because the Potter has power over the clay to make some vessels of honor and some vessels of Dishonor but each one of you let me say this this great drama of God's word this is a play if you please Genesis 1 is chapter one of the play stage one enter Adam you see what I'm saying Along Comes Eve each one of them are playing a part of a great story and this story is about how somebody fell and how they will be redeemed and how they will be restored and how that they are going to come back to a position that God has given them before the foundation of the world brother Branham comes along and gives us words and terminology called the see Gene of God and then we can break it down and talk about the DNA of God in fact Stephen love all bought me a book here years ago and you see the scientists are breaking into the great Laboratory and the booklet he gave me is called the god Gene and it's amazing how close they come to it now brother Branham says that they are breaking down into the laboratory they're looking through science through medicine microscopically now I want you to understand it doesn't matter if you look into the great Beyond in outer space or you come down from the finite to the infinite and you begin to to look even as those great minds in our day said everywhere we look whether it is the outer reaches of space or we come and we look and we go down down down down we still see everywhere the fingerprint of God Hallelujah because he's the creator of all things the prophet of God said I went to find God I didn't know him I I wasn't raised in a in a Christian home I didn't go to church he said but they began as a young boy something inside of him a deep calling to the deep and there was a deep out there to respond and he said yes I wanted to know that God I saw him in nature he says so I wrote him a letter and I put it on a tree I believe God came down and read his letter God knows the very thoughts and intents of your heart and so this story if you please of God in Martha God changes his masks he says now a lot of times we can see what God has done years ago we can see God in others but we fail to seek God in us and he says we can look back and we can see how that the spirit of Christ watch this because Christ is the anointing he said watch the spirit of Christ in David playing out his part he said watch the spirit of Christ in Boaz playing his part watch the part of Christ and he goes to all of the different figures that he desires to and he says what was it he says it was the almighty author orchestrating their life and they didn't know it because the steps of the righteous are what they're ordered of the Lord you didn't know it but God knew what you would be like he knew your nature he knew everything about you and guess what he knew your faults and failures and he loved you in spite of yourself that ought to make all of you happy because it wasn't by your works it was by his election now we go back and we see in the sermon the breach brother Brenham he picks this up let me show you quickly speaking of Adam and when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in life because he had completely Supreme control of the earth he was God of the Earth and the God and gods the god of the universe everywhere but his son had his Earth under his own control can we also think about this Earth thy will be done in this earth as it is in heaven he could speak he could name he could say he could stop nature he didn't do anything he wanted to see when he did that he lost his inheritance now Adam could say let this mountain here be moved over there and it would and it would do it Adam could say let this tree be plicked up and planted over here it would do it see for he had complete Supreme control as a minor God under God our Father because he was the son of God are you catching the pattern now when Adam fell in the garden he had lost his eternal life he lost his dominion over the animals he lost his position in place that God had put him in and he lost his right to the Tree of Life and see by the Bible says that by the Disobedience of one all became sinners and by The Obedience of one we all became redeemed back to God so the central theme all throughout the Bible is God's Plan of Redemption and restoration and what Adam and Eve did not finish in the beginning someone will let's get excited about it Oh Happy Day Hallelujah the Bible says in First John 3 verses 1 and 2 behold the manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is Hallelujah listen let's not try to speculate how it's going to be what it's going to be like and I I really I don't care to encumber my mind with those things uh theological discussions sometimes it's okay but you'll get into a an argument with a man where he's coming on a white claw cloud and another says he's coming on a a White Horse He said hey quit disagreeing about whether it's a cloud or a horse just agree he's coming Hallelujah don't let your mind get all encumbered with different things how is it going to be let me tell you and I'm gonna I'm gonna say something now that I don't want to stumble you but he says the the Rapture of the church is already taking place it's not a certain event you know a lot of times they'll say well it's just the catching away you've already been caught up you were already cut away Hallelujah when this message came it grabbed you by force it shook you like a bulldog with a rag thank you Lord they turn you around it took your world upside down Hallelujah why God's going to bring you to where he wants you to be blessed be the name of the Lord I don't know how it'll be I know this I'll be like him and I'll know him as he is known it is the love of God that has placed upon those who are called the sons of God and I like to always look and remind you that wherever you see him appear she appears it's all down through the scripture now Romans 8 verses 14 and 19. for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption now I know I'm reading this again but this for a purpose the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirits that we are the children of God and if children than heirs Heirs of God join heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to become thank you compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US she is his glory for we know that the woman is the glory of her man he is not perfect without her she compliments him she fulfills him she is the reason for his being Hallelujah he wanted to have a family he wanted to be God why would you not be the most important thing of the whole scripture because without you he would not be but because he was therefore I am no whoa my God my God how that I love you whoa crazy for the earnest expectation the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God manifestation apocalypsis it means an appearing or a coming a manifestation to be revealed a revelation that comes to manifestation Revelation in your life is not to lie dormant it is to manifest it is to bring forth it is to energize into to Quicken you amen because we see that you are right now being transformed and the power of that transformation is faith never forget that that by faith are you being changed from one glory to another Hallelujah it's already started the Rapture has already begun shout's already gone past we're already caught up I say this if you're not caught up now I doubt you'll be caught up later when you hear his voice by way of Revelation it transforms you from sinner to Saint transforms you from Earthly to heavenly from terrestrial to celestial and the scripture says because if we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly Hallelujah thank God in the sermon adoption just go along with me if you would here for a moment 1960 . now I've often said when you read or listen to The Prophet's sermons the sermons are declarations so when he's talking about adoption he's actually taking something out of the scriptures bringing it down and saying here we are in a time of adoption follow along we are living in the last days the top of the pyramid the cross fishes of the cancer age and the Zodiac and the time and the coming of Leo the Lion and the capping Stone in the days of the manifestations of the sons of God in the Bible see where we're at we're right at the end time and the prophet of God said the end time message meets the end time conditions let me tell you there's no devil can stop you there is nothing that is going to keep you short of you becoming what you need to become Hallelujah now we are living below our privileges because we have a doubt in our mind of really who we are and the prophet of God said when the true bride begins to catch a true revelation of who she is wake up mama listen you got to realize that's me and when she begins to catch this revelation and by God's spirit with discern and withstand the two Spirits working within the framework of the church now I'm not talking about out there so much I'm talking about something that will deceive the very elect if it were possible but you cannot deceive the elect you know why because they are ordained to catch it listen you don't have to be a member of this church or any other Church you just need to be in Christ Hallelujah he's orchestrating this thing it ain't some local preacher it ain't some local church it ain't somebody that's got it all unique he's got it and when you're in him you got it Hallelujah I feel like preaching adoption chapter four God since the beginning of the world predestinated us through the adoption of sons now the whole creation groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God oh I'd imagine Paul had a wonderful time I like to have been there with him wouldn't you Hallelujah adoption uh the next paragraph now go right back to Genesis to the original what is it the world of nature is groaning crying everything moving what for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak and their word is backed I believe we're on the border of it right now in fact brother Branham says you all know what I've been waiting on he said it's that third pull he says I've told you about it my for many years now in fact he preaches about it his first sermon what is a vision he said no watch that third pull he talks about fishing and all of those things listen saints of God that vision understand this was a vision of his own Ministry of the things he would go through and it was a vision about who he's trying to catch not some little fish but he said I'm looking for those rainbow trout he says now he says the reason I got all these carnal impersonators why I tried to teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things Hallelujah let's quit trying to educate and get people revelated get people into the rebel oh my goodness you can't teach them into it Hallelujah amen manifestation true Sons born son's filled we're on the border of it right now amen oh waiting groaning all nature waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God God ordained it at the beginning he gave man to Dominion the domain now I before I go any further I feel led to bring an admonishment or how do I want to say it a warning and because if you're not careful the devil will take what God is doing and he says watch he says he will either try to get you to go this way or go that way he said either make you formal and Powerless ritualistic huh just starchy church goers or you will become so fanatical huh so spiritual you're of no earthly value you don't have to pray to get out of bed you don't have to ask God whether or not you should get in your car and go to church god listen there are things you have to do anyway let's just go on so let me give you this admonishment let me show you a couple quotes and we'll go from there God's provided way of approach to Fellowship see man was actually made to be a god did you know that Jesus said if they called them who the word of God came to which was the prophets if they were Gods how can you condemn me when I say I am the son of God the prophets were considered gods man was made a Lesser God and given a domain on the earth I want you to understand this man was meant to be a god but not take God's place you're a Lesser God that's the reason the world today is groaning waiting for the full manifestations of the sons of God and there's great deep blessed teaching in that that someday man will come back into his right place and his domain will be the Earth and he will speak to the tree or to the mountain or anything and it'll just go in place just like it was intended to be we are Fallen creatures show us the father and it will suffice us man was made to be a god his domain is the Earth the whole Earth's waiting now for the manifestation of the sons of God notice brother Branham always he always conjoins these two that man was made to be a God that's what his purpose was on her and he says then that the whole creation there was his domain is crying out and groaning hurry up Mother Nature needs to slap a few of you because you you're slow and they're waiting everything this whole Mother Earth is being ravaged and all of her fossil fuels and everything and all of her gems and mirror minerals in the air and the pollutants and everything is so polluted she's gagging and if you think the mountains are pretty now if you think the rivers are beautiful now wait till she's cleansed she's groaning waiting I want you to understand that some of the very ones that caught the prophet coming into a manifestation were the animals a little possum we'd come up there and lay on his doorstep for days and he missed it he says well there she is I see it looks like she's dying he says well I think you know what I'll do he's a hunter well I'll just put her out of her misery and he says some spoke said why don't you pray for her that's why she came that's why she came yeah pray for and so he went back there back there to pray for that little possum what told that possum where'd it go what told Aunt Jemima to stand out there on that street corner I is you shooting my woman where it's your Elijah Hallelujah that little possum Sid I have need of someone and the spirit of God let that little possum to lay there on his doorstep little possum little creature of God now in the name of Jesus Christ I pray for you and he says that she up and stood up her little her little baby's on her back she turned around to look as if to say thank you kind sir and went off those deer when the prophet of God is hunting and usually deer whenever there's a hunting season on and they hear shots and and and there's hunters in the woods it's hard to find them because the deer are wary of shots and uh somebody's going to shoot them and and so after the first couple shots opening morning it's hard to find them here he is God is rifle and he's hunting for him and they walk right out of the woods he said don't you know I could shoot you right now she kept coming closer that third pull was in him the third poll is a revealing of the word the third full be real sincere this is not a public show she saw a manifestation of a son of man do you understand he can't help it it's sovereignly coming he said every time the manifestation of that third pole came it was sovereignly given let me tell you my brother my sister quit trying to manufacture some you just wait and go out sovereignly there'll become a time in your life whatever the issue is maybe that issue is what makes him God because you got no issues you've got no reason to call on him you can become lackadaisical you become just religious and you thank God but when you have a need you call God on the scene the prophet of God said I'm sorry but most of the time it takes you getting in desperation to call God on the scene Hallelujah if you call them Gods who the word of God came to what was a prophet a Divine interpreter of the word and had the Divine interpretation the signs of him foretelling for knowing and that was a Vindicated to the people that he was a prophet and this sermon the Messiah Isaiah 9 6. we just won't read it but he was the Everlasting father the Mighty God when God made man in Genesis 1 and 26 it shows if you're putting the scripture down genes 1 26 it shows that God made man to be a God to begin with man was made to be a god a Lesser God he was made in the image and likeness of God he had hands like God he had feet like God Eyes Ears intelligence like God his whole fiber because he was a Son of God and Jesus referred to him as God Jesus said how can you condemn me saying I the son of God isn't it written in your law that you are gods and if they call those Gods who the word of God came to how can you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God he was referring to the prophets the anointed ones lesser anointed Jesus was so anointed that he was more than a prophet Jesus was so anointed till he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was God the prophets had the same kind of anointing only in a lesser condition in Genesis 1 26 when God made man he made him a god because he gave him a dominion and he had rulership he had power over the birds of the air the cattle over the winds the waves and the fishes of the sea everything he had dominion over everything he was a ruler anointed a ruler because he was in the likeness in the image of God with an Earthly domain that's why the Bible says the Earth is groaning crying waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God the world is waiting for the man to come back into his right estate the world is waiting on man to come back to his rightful position true man was made to be a god see the spirit of God inside of you will never let you here's what I'm coming to the spirit of God inside of you will never let you try to think that you are greater than God it's true you are like him you are born of his bone and flesh of his flesh you have the seat Gene of God inside of you but you will never be God himself why because he's the god of Gods well I don't want to take anything away from what you are but let us not take anything away from him who is he alone is the god of Gods he is the almighty God that mind it was in Christ has got to be in US and when that mind comes into US guess what we're about our father's business the son can do nothing except the father for showing Philippians 2 verses 5 through 8 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God the Philippians were catching this that Paul said hey this mind that was in Jesus Christ let it be in you also you see if we're not careful we become unbalanced by an over emphasizing of something instead of staying right in the middle of the road see we're not if we're not careful what happens there's an anointing that will get on people and say don't you want to be like God remember he had that sermon also don't you want to be like God don't you want to know good and evil remember now they knew no evil until after they listened to him if you want to be great in the kingdom of God Jesus said learn to be the servant of All the Way Up Is Down in fact the closer you get to God the more humble you will be the more christ-like that you are the less arrogant you will be the more that you have God in you the less Pride you will have in yourself amen God help us then to never get lifted up within ourselves or forever to let us think that we are equal with God I am what I am because he is what he is I am what I am because God is my father I recognize by Revelation because he gave it to me do you see I'm a Lesser God because I'm getting something from my father blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah Flesh and Blood didn't give us to you but your father which is in heaven Upon This Rock I'll build my church God's life dwells within me that makes me God in Martha but that doesn't make me God it makes me a god what power and authority I have God gave it to me whatever victories I have it's because he is my victory whenever Throne I will sit upon is because he shared his throne with me whatever domain I rule over is because he gave it to me to have dominion over it you will never be God himself but you will be his son manifested in this world you will be a Lesser God ye are gods that's what the Bible says you are Gods but he is the god of Gods and just as I had to play a little bit of the opposite of that this past week and I tell you about the gods of this world the gods of sports the gods of moons movies the gods of rock and roll the gods of this world we can see them what is God if you define God what is God defined as an object of worship are you following that so it goes to show you there are two Revelations happening right now it is two kingdoms in conflict there are some that are catching a direct Revelation a channel if you please coming from heaven God is interpenetrating down into this dimension and you're beginning to catch where you come from but there's also another dimension the prophet of God said hell has had his lid ripped off it and demons and inspirations and all of this and the prophet of God said even these movies that are coming out he says Where do they get it from another dimension used to be years ago when I was a little boy the werewolf wow that scared everybody the guy turned his face get real hairy and the guy turns into a werewolf and starts howling you let a nine-year-old kid watch that today and he'd laugh at it you watch Frankenstein kids that laugh at it but now they're in you know zombies and and stuffing people and the Dead Walking all of that and uh it's unreal what they're feeding their minds upon because it's an inspiration so what they're doing they're getting inspired from Hell itself brother Brenham even calls television television huh he said because what the vision they had down there is inspiring the people's minds and they're mega dosing on it if he thought I love Susie or Lucy was bad oh that was just a hair brained crazy woman what would he think of the nonsense that's on there today now let me say this the Bible says ye are Gods to whom the word of the Lord came to you did not go looking for God God came looking for you you didn't look for this message this message came looking for you you weren't praying for God to send a messenger you were out there uh seeking where is Malachi for where is this angel of Revelation 10 no let me tell you that messenger came looking for you that messenger was ordained to go as Eliza was to go and find a bride for Isaac and every time he preached he's trying to find a bride and yet while he speaks his vision here is Rebecca coming into the scene I want you to understand every time Hallelujah this Prophet preaches a sermon she's appearing she's there she's Baptist she's Lutheran she's Pentecostal Hallelujah but she's seed by election and all he does is say just enough she says my God no man speak like that man you didn't look for this message message come looking for you remember the story of the the slave back in the south he had been captured back in the land of Africa put on a slave ship brought over here and was out in the fields working and another slave owner came and he wanted to see if he could buy some slaves and he took notice of a certain black slave that was out there working he worked harder he said I want to buy that one the boss said oh he ain't for sale oh no I I there's something about him man I need to get that guy because there's something about him see people should notice when you get hired there's something different about you because let me tell you how you work for your natural Master is how you work for your heavenly master not just with the lip service I want that one no he's not for sale well Mel what makes him different do you feed him different nah he gets the same stuff the other guy what about where he sleeps now he sleeps out in a pen with the rest of them whoa what is it that makes him different he says I was told that his father was a king in another land and he never forgot who his father was and so he conducted himself as a son of a king God help us it was a revelation of who he was and where he came from that kept him in Revelation of who you are it's the power that keeps you amen faith is God's word faith in God's word is the power to transform your life once you know who your father is once you know where you come from Once you know where you're going it will cause you to walk differently talk differently and act differently in fact this Revelation came to brother Branham 1965 there in Tucson he preaches a sermon called communion watch what he says what was it he said there was another William Branham see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things see it was working then look up to the trees I think Leaf I've seen you fall off last year why are you back there again where'd you come from what brought you here see it was that eternal life working in the body now that one day as I was walking that voice talking don't never smoke drink or so forth and the young fellows and all got in order all God order excuse me sometimes what happens I get teared up and the young fellows and all got older see there was something moving yet all at once I looked up I said not the Sun of Charles and Ella Branham there's something calling I want each one of you to put yourself in an exact same position you are not the son of your mother and father you are the sea Gene of God himself and there's something inside of you calling you Hallelujah can you all see him under that you have more witness through your whole life you've been that odd duckling you've been that Oddball you've been the eagle in the barnyard you wondered why you didn't like the the chicken manure why you didn't say oh I'm having a great time he thought is this really life cluck cluck cluck until one day Hallelujah he began to see a reflection Hallelujah because when he went around the Barnyard and the old rooster got up there oh he looked down and he he went he did he said that image is different from that guy's image I am weird why do I not fit in yeah and so he couldn't deny the shadow are you listening to me the shadow was telling him who he is and listen you as the light came close to you there was a shadow Hallelujah you are being overshadowed by a spirit of God and what is he doing he's showing you you're not like that you're like this and when he saw his own image and then one day he hears him yes here's something cry he said I recognize that there's something calling to me and he says he searched all over the barnyard I looked here and there he said and I heard it again and he said this time I didn't look down I looked up Hallelujah quit looking down here for where you come from quit looking down here for your identity your identity is not on Earth it's in heaven you came from God you're going back to God what is it I see my I see my own image that's where I belong all right yes sir Hallelujah something keeps calling me every day I see he's a reality oh God my prayer is for everyone here including myself let this become a greater and greater reality of knowing Who We Are the devil always tries to hinder what God is doing is that right when God makes a move Satan makes a counter move when the enemy comes in a like a flood God raises up a standard against it now remember now if the devil can't get you one way it'll push you off in another way remember you are gods to whom the word of the Lord comes to so now we have in the book of Acts chapter 14. you have Paul and Barnabas and they're preaching there's a man on a pallet and Paul perceives this man as faith he tells him rise up he jumps up he gets and he begins to praise God and everything and what does man do Acts chapter 14 they said this is Jupiter this is Saturn these men are are the gods come come down in the likeness of men you see how you can take it too far and what did they do the Bible says they rent their clothes and they did everything they could to try to convince them because the Bible says they wanted to make sacrifice Doom and they said Paul he must be Jupiter because he's the spokesman do you see how quickly because man was made to be God so people are going oh wow he must be your God how quickly do people make others gods just because they can shoot a basketball they can sing a song they can play an instrument they can do something and so people want to make them Gods because that is the purpose but we have two kinds of Gods follow along now here brother Branham said now and stand still see the salvation of the Lord now in the face of this great shaking hour that when the devil if he can't keep you from seeing the truth he will push you overboard with it the church is shook again in a sermon on certain sound Charles Fuller how many ever heard that old-fashioned Revival hour great man he said not long ago he said we have the speaking and tongues and interpretations right here right there in Long Beach and that's true I preached right there with him many times so they have the interpretation and May and make everybody sit quiet think of it is we don't reverence those gifts sometimes if a gift gets out of our listener here's a prophet if a gift gets out of order you have to call it down well ain't nobody like to be called down remember that sister he said he said quiet he said kind of reverently first sit down he kept going started speaking in tongue sit down sit down finally everybody shut up and she shut up she gonna meet him right after service gonna tell you guess what huh ah she had a real word of the Lord you he said no no he's spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophet you see how people have not been taught correctly even with the gifts in the church the prophet of God said okay Brandon Tabernacle I've let you play with these gifts all these years now it's time to put it in order hold the people accountable tongues and interpretation brother Brown said tongues and interpretation is prophecy he said now it's not reiterating scripture and I read it quote even late last night brother Brown said oh I've heard them speak in tongues for five minutes and then give a four sentence interpretation he said why watch he said if one has a certain inflection of voice and they speak so many times he said so does the interpretation huh and he said interpretation is not well wishing it's not reiteration of scriptures it's not those kind of things because Pentecost was full of that oh oh God is saying to you if you will humble yourself and pray will you not hear from God oh if you will just uh you know get away from your Idols of this world oh if you will just do this I will pour out my spirit upon you you will have blessings that you cannot contain everybody oh brother Graham said that's his well wishing he said that's repeating scripture because I can show you the scripture said if you seek God God will seek after you if huh if you make a move for God God Will Make a Move for you is his arm too sure come on now they're not just some hypothetical thing he said prophecy it'll foretell a future event don't go home by way of I-17 because there's going to be an accident and he said then let he said let the one who spoke in tongues and the one who interpreted it and then three judges three is a witness that right he said we got a room in the back he said we'll get him in the back room and then they can they can use their gift all they want they can prophesy and here it is write it down and he said if it don't come to pass he said you've got lion Spirit among you and he says and the one who spoke in tongues the one who translated and the three Witnesses stepped down wow where do you see that in our message churches why did Junior Jackson and Dawn rutle leave brother branham's Church they were sister churches because when he put the church in order they said brother Brown you know what he's Church ordered himself right out of the Holy Ghost and brother Ram said now you just leave Junior Jackson them alone if Junior Jackson here's a quote wants to have tongues and interpretation in his church he said that's his problem I like that that's his problem you see when people are held accountable you see in the Old Testament if a prophet got up and he prophesied hear o Israel thus and thus and thus and it didn't come to pass what did they do huh there'd be anyway you know what I was gonna say now so if you're not careful if he keeps you can't keep you from seeing the truth he'll push you overboard with okay watch Charles Fuller okay and sometimes the gift gets out of order see Satan trying to push them overboard if he can't keep a truth from you he'll take that same truth push you overboard with us he he'll make a fanaticism out of it God help us to have right in the middle of the road now listen saints of God I'm not afraid to take and look at the prophet's Ministry itself of spirits that we're trying to actually take this message and made it fanatical he says for you to call me Jesus Christ makes me Antichrist and yet we know that the word of the Lord comes to the prophets and the prophets are gods do you see yes amen but to take it too far now watch what brother Ram said a lot easier in church age I want to make one more comparison between the loudest and prophet the messenger and John and the prophet messenger who preached Jesus's first coming the people in John's day mistook him for the Messiah he quotes John 1 19-20 now this last day Prophet Messenger will have such power before the Lord that there will be those who must stick him mistake him for the Lord Jesus there will be a spirit now I I didn't put this in parentheses I underline this there will be a spirit in the world at the end time that will seduce some and make them believe this wow he's talking about seducing spirits brother Branham calls him he said what's a seducing Spirit seducing clergy spirit let me tell you most of the time you'll never get false doctrines from the word of God nor from the message of the hour you only get these things because they are man carried they are the STDs of the message do you know how you get AIDS not by somebody talking to you because you have personal contact with them how do you get these fanatical Spirits or other spirits to preach another Jesus to do all of these things that the Apostle Paul talks about preach another gospel he said where'd you get it you it's spiritually transmitted diseases mere Association here's another quote with kind-hearted people can send you to hell yeah but they're good people mayor Association he said now he quotes now Matthew 24. let's go to the bottom of this quote but don't you believe it he is not Jesus Christ he is not the Son of God he is one of the Brethren a prophet a messenger a servant of God he's he needs no greater honor bestowed upon him than that which John received when he was The Voice that cried I am not he but he's coming after me now let me take and do a little pit stop here for just a minute and ask you do you know any Ministries within the message that have gone so far as to that Minister has become a god minister that they worship Him they baptized in his name some of the largest churches and I'm not going to name names but it don't take long and you can search around some of the largest churches in this message those churches baptize and their pastor's name and they sing songs and they worship their Pastor as he is a God do you see if he can't get you one way he'll get you another now listen saints of God we don't want to sit there and say oh no this doesn't happen in a message or nothing no stop it wake up you're not little kids toss them out by any Winds of Doctrine hey you young people if you haven't seen this if you ain't been around it what would you do if you came up what would you do if you went into the presence of some man who's got a gift of discernment and you ain't never seen it before he stands up and he says I was over let me just give you a personal testimony okay I was over there in Europe and one of the brothers called me up and he says hey I have found a man who is a prophet and I want you to meet him and he said uh so we went and I met them and we were in Exeter England at a brother's house I don't need to say the names but uh I thought so a guy a little short guy kind of heavy said stocky guy like me only shorter anyway uh we sat down and so the next thing you know he goes to Discerning we're just sitting down having some food oh sister I see you I I see your I see you're sick I see oh you've got cancer oh the doctor yes yes [Music] and I see oh you know what thus saith the Lord don't you believe this doctor you're healed in the name of Jesus Christ how do you think she acted right there at that table whoa whoa praise God hallelujah okay now nothing wrong Saints listen let me tell you you ever been around somebody that's got a gifted discernment you ever had somebody discern you so I went ahead and I had to go use the bathroom and in the in there I just said a quick prayer and I said father when I get back let him discern me I come back here he says oh I see you I see you're called of God I see you're a young man your name is Ron I found a prophet Hallelujah man I tell you what no you know what I did I said yeah yeah you're right you're right you're right so what you see if you haven't been around somebody who's got a gift you'll be immediately be influenced you young people have you ever been around tongues and interpretation in tongues you ever been around when people are slain in the spirit have you ever seen people what is called a Pentecostal blessing with people shaking violently and lose control listen one thing that I see that I love about this message was when I came to it it was so real and so genuine there wasn't none of this phony stuff of all of this stuff and uncontrollable shaking and people falling down and all of this kind of stuff it was real it was genuine [Music] huh and yet today people allow anointings anointings is it the Holy Spirit yes it is and his Reign falls upon what the just and the unjust the of bird the same as the wheat so you don't judge it by the anointing it's a real Holy Ghost anointing even on wrong seed let me ask you a question if the Holy Spirit fell on one of you sisters and you fell on the floor would it make you act Unholy the Holy Ghost does not act Unholy I'm asking you you judge by the word and the word itself I had a brother one time tell me that I blasphemed the Holy Ghost I said I can't blaspheme the Holy Ghost I said because I get the Holy Ghost inside of me I said now I'm disagreeing with your opinion but I said you can't tell me a blasphemy the Holy Ghost I told him this is what happened I told him I said the only thing that fell on the DIA Pentecost was the Holy Spirit does it say The Believers all fail said they began to speak in tongues okay in fact it's amazing brother Paul loveball sent me a quote here this morning or yesterday he said I am so sick and tired of hearing nothing but Acts 2 4 Acts 2 4 Acts 2 4. speaking in tongues as the spirit gave him utterance he said why don't we go beyond huh I got a pair of shoes and then tongues came with it seeds of God tongues is the least of the gifts is that right he said you stay under the presence of God long enough you will speak in tongues praise God Paul said I I speak in tongues more than you all but I would rather speak five words in a language you know because it edifies your soul than ten thousand words and an unknown tongue in fact brother Reno look it up look it up he says so this glossary right now of speaking in tongues and the outpouring of the spirit it appears to be that long-awaited restoration he says the sign of tongues now coming on is a sign type it in impending disaster hmm come on now we're not little babies we are full-grown adults now we've come through all of that stuff the prophet of God said let's put it in order let's do these things and he says now let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of good works the laying on of hands Healing The Sick all of that right he said let us go on somebody say let's go yeah amen somebody say sic'em yeah I don't know I'm gonna grab all that thing my little dog she she's not real big but you know uh she's a miniature Schnauzer and and they're they're ratters they're rodent dogs they they bred him to go down into into little holes and to get a a rat or something down in the hole well the other day just two days ago I was up in my home in Prescott and I opened up I had a little uh mechanical shop outside where I got my all my tools and opened up the rolling doors screwed a mouse with the dog she's gone like this I'm gone get out he looked at me she don't know what to get but she's smelling like get him get him her little tail went to a hang on like this she comes over and she started looking up there's three shelves and there's a top shelf and she's gone I go what what what I've never seen her act like this what are you doing what's the matter with you I dropped you as a puppy I know yeah so you know what I did I took a couple of the things off of the top shelf I picked her up and she's going I set her on the Shelf the shelf's about that wide six feet long and it dug she jumped on top of a black plastic bag she she goes like this she stops her head inside this black plastic bag [Music] like this and I'm going get her get him get him get him I don't even know what she's trying to get get them I can hear something scurrying around so what I did I pulled a bag I'm afraid of the bag too I don't want whatever is it getting on me I'm going whoa I drop it on the floor get it get it she sticks her head in there so I come over to help her and I rip it open there goes one Mouse get it get it get it she's looking over here she don't follow it and here's one scurrying around it goes out of the bag goes up the the block wall the cement block wall hey them mice go right up a block wall goes right up to this block wall and I go ah and I hit it and she saw me hit that Mouse and that Mouse hit the ground and she was on it I got me a hunting dog let me tell you this dog got a hold of that little mouse I said get him get him yeah her price just went yeah spirits all right yeah amen don't get me too excited you don't want to see me get excited amen now watch let me set the the record straight this morning it's not the ministry of some man that is perfecting the bride it is not a Ministry of some church nor is it the ministry of the pastor now let me say to you it is the Holy Spirit let me give you a quote brother Branham says in the sermon Investments now I'm going to read the highlighted portions because to save time look the word of the Lord comes through the prophet John was the prophet of the hour he was standing in the water declaring that the Messiah was already among them somewhere he would know it by a sign and when the Messiah being the word he came into the water to the prophet the word coming to the prophet so now we think you are God's why because to whom the word of the Lord comes to are you putting two and two together here all right and Jesus said in these days he which is a personal pronoun he the Holy Ghost when he has come upon you come to you he will show you these things I've taught you and show you things to come remember excuse me Remains the same thing the Holy Spirit is the prophet among us today the Holy Spirit is the prophet can you say Amen to that no I'm not taking anything away from Brother Branham he was the vessel but the voice the spirit of God coming to him watch this anointed one's the end time the Bible said in the mouth that two or three Witnesses Larry word be established I spoke of Balaam and of Moses I spoke of Micaiah and zedekiah now I'm going to give you one more which there's hundreds of them but one more to make them three Witnesses I got a whole string of wrote down here but to preserve time and he talks about Jeremiah but now every Prophet true Prophet that ever raised in the world cursed those denomination organizations of the church how could it change by the unchanging God the holy spirit is the prophet of this hour no I thought William Branham was understand he's the vessel God used that's why some will say well we need to put the prophet back in the pulpit saying to God he never left he changed his mouth God in Martha but the reason that we fail to catch god brother Ram said it's the veil it's because of our human Veil we we fail to catch what God is doing amen the holy spirit's the prophet of this hour he's vindicating his word proving and the Holy Spirit was the prophet of Moses hour well I thought Moses was a prophet no the holy spirit in Moses the Holy Spirit was the prophet in micaiah's hour the Holy Spirit which wrote the word comes and confirms the word just as it was the Holy Spirit anointing men throughout the Bible and it became the word of God what was it God in Martha was it not the Holy Spirit and the Prophet this hour doing the same thing is it so hard for us to discern it brother random are you the son of man he said have I been with you so long that you don't get it right I'm a son of man revealing to you the son of man don't look at me he said I'm just the voice remember the sermon the voice of the sign he said don't look at the sign look at the voice behind this eye amen watch this now the uncertain sound trying to bring this to a close the Gentile nation was issued in with King Nebuchadnezzar with unknown tongues and interpretation and goes out the same way as it was so shall it be amen now he's he's showing you a pattern follow the pattern issued in by worship of the image of a man a holy man Daniel which was built to shazar the image of Daniel to make everybody worship that image of a holy man and go out the same way brother Brown said look as the Gentile Kingdom came in this way tongues interpretation image of a holy man and worship that image the three Hebrew children what image did they feel two bow down to which sent him to the fiery furnace was Daniel oh God still got a few Hebrew children around fact seven thousand that have not bowed their need of Baal amen you can explain it to people and show it to people and they don't know which way to go Daniel refused to bow down to his own image no true Messenger of God will ever allow you to worship them I tell you what the day some of you start baptizing in my name huh I'm going to retire I'm gonna quit I'm gonna say what's wrong with you huh yeah now my neighbor said this this is very interesting and I I don't mean to Rabbit Trail on this but it's very important my neighbor came to me yesterday I haven't seen him in several months at my cabin next his cabin up there and in Prescott he came to me I said Hey Barry how you doing yeah I'll get this now how's your health yeah yeah he said my wife you know her her father where it says her mother is so bad in Alzheimer's and she doesn't know anybody and she you know we want to put her in the hospice but she won't do it and everybody's against her and all that you know all of this stuff and he said so I realized that um when you get to the place that the person you're trying to talk to is not cognizant or understands what they're going through he said I decided to write all of my children a letter this is what he told me he says so I wrote myself a letter and gave it to all three of my children he said the letter is actually to myself and if I realize you're reading that letter I have come to the place that I need to go into hospice he says I wrote the letter to myself I think saints of God now I'll be honest with you if I ever get to the place where I am just repeating and repeating stories and my Ministry Becomes of none effect and you know what I may do I may write myself a letter I'll give it to my board and I'll give it to my family and if you ever have to show me Hey Ron you wrote this letter in 2022 you're at that place that helped push my wheelchair over no Saints have gone what I'm seeing God help us each one of us now I started to tell you that no messenger no servant of God will ever allow you to worship them how about do you remember in the Book of Revelation chapter 22 verses 8 through 9. tonight John saw these things and heard them and I heard and seen and I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things this is an angel man he showed me things and saw I fell down at his feet and see thou do it not for am I of thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God Hallelujah there's a true servant of God and brother Brennan would never allow us to take our eyes off of Jesus Christ and when he starts when you started looking at him he said I got nothing to do with it amen musicians go ahead and come they can still come I'm just not quitting now brother Branham anointed ones at the end time watch this you might have thought today I was trying to say that about myself being that I was packing this message I have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice my voice against my own better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father that I declare to do and determined to do I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one who performs these sayings and foretells these things happens as perfect as they are I'm only one near when he doesn't I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's just what I surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no he was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery of God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the Son of Man the son of man is Christ and he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail you're feeding on the unfaily body word of the son of man keep your eyes focused on Christ when you make the prophet God himself you make him Antichrist and yet God was in him finally quote there possessing the Gate of the enemy 1964. skip just a little bit here because I want to get to just something directly ahead give me another five ten minutes possessing the Gated enemy let's check some of them now Abraham's seed let's take the Hebrew children because they stood true and wouldn't tolerate that image worship they refused to bow down to an image that the kingdom of the nation had made it was a made effort a holy man to the image of Daniel showed that the Gentile race is under the false side of worshiping an image of a holy man it goes out the same way when people will be forced to worship images of people it came in by revelation of Daniel being able to interpret the word and was wrote in the handwriting on the wall that's the way it come in that's the way it goes out same way image of the Gentile they refuse to do it and what they do they were Abraham's seeds standing true to the word and they possessed the Gate of the enemy of Fire the bride is now beginning to discern the Antichrist Spirit not only in the world but also in the message now let me show you something else too because we're coming into a manifestation of the sons of God is that right but now there's two manifestations sons of God Sons of the devil serpent seat and God seed so let me show you it happened in job State Job chapter 1 verses 6 and 7. and there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them sons of God began to manifest present themselves and guess what Satan was right there remember the parable of the sower of Sydney and he said and God so see it in his field and while men slip he said the enemy came in and sowed his tears and a little bit later when the seeds sprung up sin came up the tears and the wheat and the angel said shall we go tear up the tears shall we go no he said leave them go until the end time who sowed it he said an enemy has done this here we are right in the Fulfillment of the sowing of tears and wheat same field same time same coming to manifestation okay the two vines coming together it happens again in job two verses 1 and 2. and again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord so we have two manifestations sons of God and Sons of the serpent they're manifesting themselves and let me tell you they're playing their part real well they're getting so far out they don't know their identity huh you talk about a Sodom spirit Sodom and Gomorrah has infiltrated the people of the world until they have lost their minds the Bible says there to present themselves it has two applications one is to present yourself is to give an account as to Obedience of the word number two is to receive further instruction and insight for the future not only obedience but for future things amen the Bible says in second Corinthians 4 3 3 and 4 if our gospel be hit to them that are lost in whom the God of this world we're talking about gods ye are Gods they're hearing the same thing huh basketball players football players musicians rock and roll players movie stars you're gods and people will walk around with their image on them with their name on their back they go to the games and what do you think they do when they get under that anointing they're worshiping the god What About Us it seems to God you should never be embarrassed to go ahead once in a while get a little loud and amen and huh yeah and don't do it because somebody else is doing it listen I will do the same thing whether I'm sitting up here and hearing another preacher preach amen amen once in a while yes sir um yes sir there'll be times when you know what and I like some of you that you ain't afraid to stand up I don't care if nobody else is standing huh because if you feel like standing you stand up amen somebody around you might get a little anointed too like a colored lady and deep call it the Deep whoo God bless you Colored Lady thank you he goes on to preach a little bit more the camera how many of you seen the film she's standing up God bless you Colored Lady he said that Pillar of Fire is just above you right now I wonder how many times that God comes through this congregation and he hovers over one of you and you feel his presence and it becomes so so real that what you do you just there's something inside of you that's just you can't hardly contain it I'm saying why don't you break the sound barrier once in a while I don't want us to become so Church ordered that you're afraid of a real move of God huh we don't need these instruments here to get you guys all worked up I will show you that 99 of the time whenever you have a move in a church or something like that it's not because the preacher because you know what while he's preaching he's conditioning the people I'll tell you what Hallelujah when the holy spirit moves I ain't ashamed of it glory to God hallelujah and the next thing you know and people yeah let's get up here somebody get a song come on and you know if the spirit of the Lord moves in my heart I will dance like David dance the next thing you know everybody the next thing you know you got everybody now they're getting into the spirit watch it they're getting one another spirit Saints have gone I remember now Sandy I just had Andreas ring and call me just before service in my office his father died a couple weeks ago and I didn't know it remember I tell you about that youth group over in Germany and how the greatest outpouring of the Holy Spirit I'd ever seen in my own personal life Amos you were there I had a vision that morning [Music] I usually don't tell a lot of this stuff I had a vision I I saw in this vision I saw myself preaching now it's in a farmhouse The Farmhouse has got so many kids that the the kids are as close to me as what you guys are right here foreign I've got my translator right here the presence of God is moving and all of a sudden everything that I saw in my vision I step into it you know what the three or four girls that were sitting right here I saw them in the vision I said I said Lord I'm in the vision I'm in the vision and in the vision I told a man I pointed him out I said young man stand up and say you love the Lord these three girls turned around Jonathan to see who I'm pointing to guess what he's the worst kid in the group he is the worst sinner among all of them and these girls guess what they did they turned around to look to see who I said stand up and say you love the Lord ever miss it preacher you say you got a gifted discernment this man raised his hand he said you know yesterday when brother Ron was preaching he said I want something real I don't want something I don't want just an emotion I need to know it's real he said this was his father's place his father just died a few weeks ago I didn't know it he said I stayed in the hay loft above where you throw the hay down to the cows and everything this is a farmhouse he said I stayed up in the Loft and I cried out to God all night oh God oh God if you're real if you are truly real I need a sign I need you to do something Lord I Need to Know he said you have brother Ron call me out have him call me out and stand up and say I love the Lord how do you think he felt when I said young man stand up and say you love the Lord he began to talk about how that God and the next thing you know saying to God you know what and I said don't nobody move the organ and the piano God don't need your help if he's here I said just worship Him you don't have to work it up and one by one they all began to get into the Spirit of worship and next thing you know I saw a move of God it wasn't something I orchestrated come on yeah when we all get to heaven what it was a song besides your help on the day of Pentecost they were sitting just like you're doing they were sitting and they all got into one mind and one Accord and if you all will start to get into one mind in one Accord and you will begin to have faith rise up in there guess what and oh there could be a sound like a rushing Mighty Wind he didn't tell him what to expect he didn't tell him what would happen he just said stay there until you were a dude with power from on high amen laughs Lucifer who is the God of this world is bringing his gods to fruition that's who you go to school with you go to bank you go to the supermarket and everywhere you go you're surrounded by gods [Music] and they don't look they don't mind letting you know who they worship when they are in their car they turn up the volume huh have you had any of them pass you lately ah I'll never forget the time I I got a CJ5 Jeep took the top off and I had just bought a nice stereo so I could hear the prophet and hear the tape of the Prophet while I'm driving the jeep 50 miles an hour down the road because the wind so I could turn it up man it's a good stereo speaker system so I'd turn it up and I'm driving down the road no doors no top all this noise well I was just coming from church and I'm driving through town and I'm going stoplight after stoplight and so I kind of turn it down a little bit and you can still hear it anybody driving next to you they hear it well I remember four girls in a car come next to me and they were in a convertible and they got their music like this and everything and the music was louder than the voice of the Prophet so I turned up the volume of the prophet Brethren said you painted face Jezebel he said something like that with all four of their heads just snap back around I said yeah he's talking to you all saints of God I'm not ashamed of this gospel I love it there isn't hardly a day that goes by this is not lighting a candle this is not being religious saints of God this is hearing his voice because there is one ordained of God to turn your hearts back in this age listen if there's any message I propagate it's a message of Malachi 4. it's not me it's not I I'm just a letter carrier you can't get mad at me that's why why do you think I put the quotes up up here because I just don't want you to see that this is something I want you to see it and then what's even better I tell you you go home and listen to the whole tape amen all right go to the quote on the first seal I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna close with this quote first seal Jeffersonville as soon as you guys pull it up here we'll go ahead Brethren yeah there it is first seal that white horse rider has been in the land all the time he will change from Antichrist he does that and becomes a to a false prophet he started an antichrist his Spirit then he becomes a false prophet then later the devil is cast out he's incarnate then with the devil we're talking about God in Martha we're talking about Satan who is a God in Martha okay first stage the devil to begin with Spirit of the devil then he becomes a false prophet teacher false doctor next thing he comes as the very Devil Himself incarnate same time that this devil falls out of heaven and becomes incarnate in a man the Holy Spirit goes up and comes down incarnate man you like you two events happening same time what is it God in Martha a god of the world in morpha in the world and the god of gods in morphe in his people amen second seal Judas Iscariot Christ was the Incarnate God you had the Incarnate in flesh Emmanuel and Judas was the son of perdition as Jesus was the son of God incarnate God incarnate devil I trust that what you've done you've listened to me I've kind of jumped around here and there but I hope you get the idea and the understanding God in Martha what is it it's Christ in you this is the mystery that's been hit down Through the Ages what is it it's Christ in you and that's why when you heard the message and the Word was preached to you and it was revealed to you on how to live how to dress how to go to church how to make a sacrifice you manifested the Revelation and then God said that's righteousness amen don't love him I thank God no man taught me this I was taught by my Father which is in heaven Upon This Rock I'll build my church Hallelujah we may not be the jump in the shouting us that's okay that's okay because the time will come when it's real and when it's genuine let me tell you I'm going to have a jubilee right along with all of you and I'm going to have more fun just watching some of you that have never ever let go yeah maybe some of you will have to wait until we get over there and the rewards are given and crowns are given and everything and finally you let go and all of us will be watching going on I knew it I knew it it was in them the whole time but they just had to wait until they got over there I'm not gonna let no Rock take my place because if I don't huh what'll happen some rock says I'll cry out yeah hey Rock hold your voice why this is my day this is my time amen God and morpha don't become powerless religious having a form of godliness see the devil oh just just yeah don't be fanatical yet and then if he can't get you that way then he said oh hey that next thing you know get some fanaticism out here no right in the middle of the road hey man brother Brown says look at the ministers that have hit the ditch look at the scrap hits of piles and ministers that didn't go into it
