[30:09] get ready to sing.
[30:31] Thank you.
[31:01] [Music]
[31:04] Thank you.
[31:10] I haven't sang in a while, so
[31:15] feels good.
[31:17] [Music]
[31:20] I was poor,
[31:22] so poor
[31:24] as a beggar,
[31:28] unwanted
[31:31] and surely
[31:33] unclean.
[31:37] despised
[31:39] by the folks who lived around me,
[31:45] who would cringe at the sound of my
[31:50] name.
[31:53] Then one day I met a man called Jesus
[32:01] and he offered my soul
[32:06] everything
[32:09] and he welcomed
[32:12] me in. and he bought all my sin. And now
[32:18] I live in the house of the king.
[32:24] I
[32:26] don't dwell in a shack near life's
[32:30] ghetto.
[32:32] [Music]
[32:33] I don't cater
[32:36] to what sin may bring.
[32:41] But instead,
[32:43] I'm surrounded
[32:46] by angels
[32:50] and I live in the house of the king.
[32:58] Now sin takes its pride and its
[33:02] pleasure,
[33:05] but not one thing did it have for me.
[33:13] My days were all spent feeling sorry
[33:21] and my nights filled with the misery.
[33:29] But one day I was clothed in his glory
[33:37] just like tree budding leaves in the
[33:41] spring.
[33:45] Now my days are all blessed and my
[33:49] nights filled with rest because I live
[33:54] in the house of the king.
[33:59] I don't dwell in the shack near life's
[34:05] ghetto.
[34:07] [Music]
[34:08] I don't cater
[34:11] to what sin may bring.
[34:16] But instead,
[34:18] I'm surrounded
[34:20] by angels
[34:24] and I live in the house of the king.
[34:31] [Music]
[34:36] Amen. Thank you for our song specials
[34:38] today. Amen. Let's stand this morning.
[34:41] The house of a king.
[34:44] Amen.
[34:44] Hallelujah.
[34:46] What promises we have when we are in the
[34:48] house of the king. There's a fountain
[34:50] open in the house of David this morning.
[34:53] Hallelujah. This morning, Lord, let that
[34:56] fountain open today. And let it flow
[35:00] richly to our souls today, Lord. Amen.
[35:03] Would you like another drink from the
[35:05] fountain of living water? Let's sing
[35:07] this as brother Ron comes this morning.
[35:11] And there's a fountain
[35:15] open in the house
[35:18] of day
[35:21] to you
[35:23] would be we
[35:28] and there are streams of grace that's
[35:32] flowing down
[35:35] from C.
[35:37] Come
[35:39] now and
[35:41] receive. Let's lift our hands and sing
[35:43] it again. There's a B
[35:47] open in the house
[35:53] to you
[35:55] who would
[35:57] believe. We believe today Lord
[36:02] of grace that's falling down
[36:07] from
[36:11] now.
[36:17] Let's just bow our heads together.
[36:20] Heavenly Father, Lord, we come before
[36:24] you this morning. We honor your
[36:26] resurrection. And we thank you that
[36:28] there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem.
[36:30] Yes, Lord.
[36:31] That you live and reign forever on high.
[36:35] Father, I pray that as we enter into
[36:38] this portion of the service, you will
[36:40] receive all honor and glory. Lord, open
[36:43] every eye, Father, to more promises in
[36:46] your word that we might claim it as an
[36:49] inheritance, Father, for we know that
[36:51] your seed shall possess the gate of
[36:54] every enemy.
[36:55] Amen. remember those in need this
[36:57] morning. Those physical, spiritual,
[37:00] whatever the need be. Father, we place
[37:03] them before you knowing that you're a
[37:05] God that provides all our needs.
[37:08] We thank you. We praise you. We ask
[37:10] these things for your glory in Jesus
[37:12] Christ's name. Amen.
[37:15] Amen. Turn around, shake somebody's
[37:16] hand, and you can be seated this

[43:37] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[43:41] I have a baby dedication
[43:44] this morning.
[43:46] So, if brother Steven and sister Emily
[43:50] will bring their little one.
[43:55] Yes. Bring them in.
[43:59] Bring them in.
[44:02] Bring them in from the field of sin.
[44:09] Bring them in.
[44:13] Bring them in.

[44:24] Brother Andy and Sister Becky, would you
[44:26] please come up here also, please?
[44:35] Yeah. You guys come on up here a little
[44:38] bit closer.
[44:40] Yeah.
[44:42] What a lovely little family, huh?
[44:47] Brother Stephen, God bless you richly.
[44:51] It was just a few years ago I had you in
[44:54] my arms.
[44:58] 32.
[45:04] But now and then Emily, you guys come
[45:07] down here and transplanted was here.
[45:10] Next thing you know,
[45:14] and uh God gave you a little family.
[45:18] Amen.
[45:18] Amen.
[45:19] We're proud of the two of you
[45:21] and he's blessed you now with another
[45:24] son.
[45:26] Amen. To keep Wyatt company,
[45:31] keep him happy
[45:34] and uh everything. Let me read here from
[45:37] the scriptures.
[45:43] Matthew 19.
[45:45] Then were there brought unto him little
[45:46] children, that he should put his hands
[45:49] on them, and pray, and the disciples
[45:52] rebuked them. But Jesus said, "Suffer
[45:54] little children," and forbid them not,
[45:58] but to come unto me, for of such is the
[46:01] kingdom of heaven. And he laid his hands
[46:03] on them, and departed then.
[46:11] Now we have here this morning
[46:15] Lewis Tate Manard. Lewis
[46:18] actually means renowned
[46:21] or famous in battle, a famous warrior.
[46:24] Amen. That's going to go with my sermon
[46:25] this morning. We're talking about
[46:28] spiritual warfare.
[46:32] And Steven wrote down Psalms 144:1
[46:36] reads, "Blessed be the be the Lord, my
[46:39] strength, which teacheth my hands to war
[46:43] and my fingers to fight." Tate actually
[46:47] means cheerful.
[46:48] And then they quote in Proverbs 15:13,
[46:54] "A merry heart maketh a cheerful
[46:56] countenance,"
[46:58] but by sorrow of the heart, the spirit
[47:00] is broken. And this was his prayer that
[47:03] he actually put in here. May our son be
[47:07] mighty in battle through his heavenly
[47:09] father's strength.
[47:11] I think every father would like to say
[47:13] that about their son. May they have the
[47:16] strength of the Lord when they go into
[47:18] battle. May he be a cheerful warrior
[47:20] carrying a strong uplifted countenance
[47:23] into the battles of this end time. Amen.
[47:27] So I want to take this little one now.
[47:33] Kids are such fun, aren't they? Huh?
[47:42] The Bible says, "And he took the little
[47:44] ones in his arms and he blessed them."
[47:46] I would like you to bow your heads with
[47:49] me
[47:51] as we pray over this little son.
[47:56] Heavenly Father,
[47:58] I lay my hands upon Lewis Tate Manard.
[48:03] Father Lewis means renowned, a famous
[48:09] warrior. Father, I pray, oh God, that if
[48:12] you should tar your coming, may he be
[48:15] like those mighty gentile warriors of
[48:18] old, how they fought battles for you and
[48:21] won great many victories. I pray,
[48:24] Father, may the sword of your word be
[48:28] his strength and his defense. I pray
[48:31] over him, Father, that he'll be a
[48:33] cheerful one who has a joyful
[48:36] countenance. Father, he'll be a joy to
[48:38] his family and to his brother. I pray,
[48:41] oh God, that you will watch over him,
[48:44] Father, all the days of his life. And
[48:47] now, Father, we bring him back to you
[48:49] from whence he come. And I lay my hands
[48:52] upon him and I bless him that you might
[48:55] use him, Father, at some time in the
[48:58] future for your glory. We thank you. We
[49:00] praise you. We ask it in Jesus Christ's
[49:03] name.
[49:05] Amen.
[49:06] Amen.
[49:06] Amen. Well, he's he's sleeping. He's
[49:09] just he's just real happy here.
[49:14] Grab him there. Yeah. Okay.
[49:18] Oh, he woke up now. See?
[49:21] God bless you, Steve. God bless you.
[49:25] Yeah. Okay.
[49:27] I don't think Yeah, he's a little shy.
[49:30] God bless you.
[49:33] God bless you.
[49:37] Hallelujah.
[49:44] Praise the Lord.
[49:47] I greet all of you that have come from
[49:50] your long vacations
[49:53] and are back in the church now. And for
[49:56] you that are about to leave, we send you
[49:59] with our blessings, asking you to travel
[50:02] safe and have a nice time with your
[50:05] family. And God bless you as you all
[50:07] travel. Would you just stand with me?
[50:23] Heavenly Father,
[50:26] we have come here this morning
[50:29] that we might learn of you.
[50:33] You said, "Take your yoke upon you,
[50:37] for your yoke is easy and your burden is
[50:40] light." If there is anyone here this
[50:43] morning that is burdened, that has
[50:45] things upon their heart, oh God, that
[50:48] they just seem to be a little
[50:49] overwhelming to them, I pray you, the
[50:53] God who is mighty in battle. Would you
[50:56] come and drive away the enemy and go
[50:59] before us as you did the children of
[51:01] Israel, make a way, Father, for you're a
[51:04] way maker.
[51:05] I thank you and I praise you. We commit
[51:08] this service into thy hands. I pray that
[51:11] your leadership of the Holy Spirit would
[51:13] be our portion. I yield myself to you,
[51:16] Father, as I've just been waiting on you
[51:19] and thinking about you, waking early in
[51:21] the morning and meditating even before I
[51:24] got out of bed, Father, upon thy word.
[51:29] We pray now, Father, you will bless the
[51:31] word. And I pray that each one will
[51:34] receive something from God, knowing that
[51:37] you are a faithful God. and that you
[51:40] hear our prayers.
[51:41] We commit it to you in Jesus Christ's
[51:44] name.
[51:45] Amen.
[51:45] Amen.
[51:46] Amen. Just remain standing. Turn with me
[51:48] in your Bibles to the Old Testament, the
[51:51] book of Joel, chapter 3. The book of
[51:54] Joel, chapter 3. Somebody say, "Praise
[51:56] God."
[51:57] Praise God.
[51:58] Amen. God is worthy to be praised.
[52:01] Yes, he is.
[52:11] Joel 3:es 9-14.
[52:17] Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles.
[52:24] Prepare war.
[52:26] Wake up the mighty men. Let all the men
[52:29] of war draw near.
[52:32] Let them come up.
[52:35] Beat your plowshares into swords
[52:39] and your pruning hooks into spears.
[52:44] Let the weak say, I am strong.
[52:47] Amen.
[52:48] Amen.
[52:49] Assemble yourselves and come all ye
[52:52] heathen and gather yourselves together
[52:54] round about. Thither cause the mighty
[52:58] ones come down, O Lord.
[53:02] Let the heathen be awakened and come up
[53:05] to the valley of Jehoshaphat,
[53:07] for there will I sit to judge all the
[53:09] heathen roundabout.
[53:11] Put ye in the sickle,
[53:14] for the harvest is ripe.
[53:17] Come, get you down, for the press is
[53:19] full, and the fats overflow,
[53:22] for their wickedness is great. Notice
[53:24] there's two things coming to harvest.
[53:27] Things of the world and the things of
[53:29] God. Amen.
[53:33] Multitudes, multitudes
[53:36] in the valley of decision, for the day
[53:38] of the Lord is near in the valley of
[53:42] decision.
[53:43] Amen.
[53:43] Amen.
[53:45] When it says prepare war, it is a Hebrew
[53:49] word kadash.
[53:52] It actually actually means to
[53:54] consecrate, to sanctify,
[53:57] to be dedicated, to be hallowed, to be
[53:59] holy, to be sanctified, and to be
[54:01] separate.
[54:02] Amen.
[54:03] Amen.
[54:04] God has called you to be holy.
[54:08] Sanctified and separate.
[54:11] Just as the Muslims
[54:14] call upon their believers to have holy
[54:16] jihad.
[54:21] And the Hebrews were called to Kadosh.
[54:27] It was a time of war.
[54:28] Amen.
[54:32] And we realize there are two ways before
[54:34] us right now.
[54:36] The ways of God
[54:38] and the ways of the world.
[54:40] Amen.
[54:46] And we know that whenever God makes a
[54:48] move, Satan makes a move also. Amen.
[54:51] That's right.
[54:53] So, we need to know which move we're
[54:55] going into.
[54:57] Because you're going to be influenced by
[54:59] one or the other.
[55:02] May you be under the correct influence.
[55:04] Amen.
[55:04] Amen.
[55:06] May you be influenced of the Holy
[55:08] Spirit.
[55:12] Amen. Turn with me if you would to
[55:13] Matthew chapter 10.
[55:23] Matthew chap 10 verse 34.
[55:32] Think not that I am come to send peace
[55:34] on earth.
[55:39] I came not
[55:41] to send peace
[55:44] but a sword.
[55:45] Amen.
[55:47] For I am come to set a man at variance
[55:50] against his father,
[55:54] and the daughter against her mother, and
[55:56] the daughter-in-law against her
[55:58] mother-in-law.
[56:01] And a man's foes
[56:04] shall be they of his own household.
[56:08] He that loveth father or mother more
[56:10] than me is not worthy of me.
[56:14] And he that loveth son or daughter more
[56:16] than me is not worthy of me.
[56:20] And he that taketh not his cross
[56:24] and followth after me is not worthy of
[56:27] me.
[56:29] And he that findeth his life
[56:33] shall lose it.
[56:37] And he that loses his life for my sake
[56:40] shall find it.
[56:41] Amen.
[56:42] Amen.
[56:43] He that receiveth you receiveth me,
[56:47] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[56:49] that sent me.
[56:52] He that receiveth a prophet in the name
[56:54] of a prophet shall receive a prophet's
[56:56] reward.
[56:57] Amen.
[57:00] And he that receiveth a righteous man in
[57:03] the name of a righteous man shall
[57:06] receive a righteous man's reward.
[57:09] And whosoever shall give to drink unto
[57:13] one of these little ones a cup of cold
[57:15] water, only in the name of a disciple,
[57:19] verily I say unto you, he shall in no
[57:23] wise
[57:24] lose his reward.
[57:26] Amen.
[57:27] Father, I thank you for your word. I ask
[57:29] your blessing upon it now. Speak to
[57:31] every heart. We ask it for your glory in
[57:34] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[57:36] Amen.
[57:37] God bless you. be seated this morning in
[57:39] the presence of the Lord.
[57:44] All right. This is
[57:47] uh
[57:49] part three of the revealing of the o
[57:52] open book is a declaration of war.
[57:56] I'm taking a different viewpoint
[57:59] about the open book because we rejoice
[58:02] about this open book and take it and eat
[58:04] it and we assimilate it and everything.
[58:06] But there's a reason why
[58:09] that the seals were opened
[58:12] and the mysteries revealed. It's to let
[58:14] you know there's a war on and you need
[58:18] to know how to fight a good fight.
[58:20] Amen.
[58:21] That you might war a good warfare
[58:24] because we've fight not against flesh
[58:26] and blood but against principalities and
[58:29] powers.
[58:30] That's right. I want you to understand
[58:32] that we are in a battle this morning. It
[58:36] is not a picnic.
[58:37] Amen.
[58:38] When you have entered into Canaan land,
[58:40] we realize that Canaan is not a type of
[58:42] heaven because in Canaan they wound up
[58:46] having to possess the land and they
[58:48] fought and there was many battles and
[58:51] there were giants there. You would think
[58:53] that God, who is an all merciful God and
[58:56] an allloving God, would give you a land
[58:59] that's not inhabited by anybody. You
[59:02] just go in and take whatever
[59:04] part of the land you want. This is mine
[59:06] and you didn't have to fight for it.
[59:10] But that's not what God did. His ways
[59:12] are above our ways and his thoughts are
[59:14] above our thoughts.
[59:15] Amen.
[59:16] So
[59:18] I want to take
[59:20] this morning a subject of the call to
[59:23] arms is sounded in prepare for war.
[59:32] For the opening of the seven seals
[59:35] is not just the mysteries being
[59:38] revealed.
[59:40] It is not just about a white horse
[59:42] rider, a red horse rider. We're finding
[59:44] out that those are powers.
[59:46] That's right.
[59:47] And they are antichrist.
[59:50] And they are coming against the church.
[59:52] But every time that there is a power
[59:54] coming against the church, God rises up
[59:57] a standard.
[59:58] Amen.
[59:58] Hallelujah.
[1:00:00] So the white horse rider has now one to
[1:00:04] rise up, which is the lion.
[1:00:08] So the four horse riders, you have the
[1:00:10] lion, the ox, the man, the eagle,
[1:00:13] and they are the combative forces that
[1:00:15] are coming against that which is riding
[1:00:19] down through the ages.
[1:00:22] Now we all know that the prophet of God
[1:00:24] said before I had the revealing of the
[1:00:29] first seal, he says, you all know I
[1:00:32] preached the seals before. took about 20
[1:00:35] minutes
[1:00:37] and I thought that the white horse
[1:00:39] writer. He had gotten it confused and he
[1:00:43] had read what different ones had said
[1:00:46] about it and he said, "Why? That's
[1:00:48] Christ writing down through the ages."
[1:00:51] In fact, brother Brennan preaches a
[1:00:53] sermon, the mighty conqueror. And every
[1:00:55] one of those, he takes that as his text
[1:00:59] and he's talking about that this is
[1:01:01] Christ on a white horse. He has a bow
[1:01:03] and no arrows. so on and so forth. But
[1:01:06] with the opening of the first seal, he
[1:01:08] realizes, oh my, I was a 100 miles from
[1:01:12] the truth.
[1:01:13] And then he realize it's the antichrist.
[1:01:16] Amen.
[1:01:17] So now there's an antichrist. It starts
[1:01:19] out as a spirit and goes into a saying
[1:01:22] and an anointing becomes creeds and
[1:01:24] dogmas and an unbending way. And the
[1:01:27] very thing that God was trying to get
[1:01:29] the people founded on, the enemy is
[1:01:32] doing everything that he can to take
[1:01:34] away the revealed word of that
[1:01:38] Ephesian church age.
[1:01:40] So even before the Ephesian church age
[1:01:43] had come to an end, realize they'd
[1:01:46] already lost their first love. Isn't it
[1:01:48] amazing how the enemy can come in and
[1:01:51] attack the church, even those who were
[1:01:53] there that heard Jesus
[1:01:56] or heard the disciples
[1:01:58] and had walked with him,
[1:02:01] how quickly
[1:02:03] things can change
[1:02:05] and how that the enemy wants to come in
[1:02:07] and and just make a religion and he
[1:02:10] wants to take away the true word and put
[1:02:14] another hybrid word in its place. Amen.
[1:02:16] And when you hybrid the word, it loses
[1:02:19] its power.
[1:02:20] God, help us to stay with that
[1:02:23] unadulterated word. The word of God is
[1:02:25] our absolute. That is plum line.
[1:02:28] Man shall not live by bread alone, but
[1:02:30] by every word.
[1:02:32] Hallelujah. So the word of God is our
[1:02:34] absolute. Somebody asked me the other
[1:02:36] day, "Brother Ron, is brother Brennham
[1:02:38] our absolute?" I said, "No, sir."
[1:02:41] I said because
[1:02:43] brother Brennham said our absolute is
[1:02:46] the word of God.
[1:02:47] He said if I or an angel quoting Paul he
[1:02:51] says come down and preach to you another
[1:02:53] gospel that has not already been
[1:02:56] preached let him be cursed.
[1:02:58] So we see it's a spiritual warfare. I
[1:03:02] want all of you to understand that you
[1:03:03] were born into a conflict.
[1:03:06] Amen.
[1:03:06] You're part of it.
[1:03:09] And so depending on whose side you're on
[1:03:13] will be dependent upon what kind of
[1:03:16] manifestation you have in your life
[1:03:19] because you will do the works of your
[1:03:22] father.
[1:03:23] Amen.
[1:03:23] That's right.
[1:03:29] You see, the opening of the seven seals
[1:03:31] was to reveal to the elect bride
[1:03:36] the type of warfare that we are to fight
[1:03:38] in this end time.
[1:03:40] Amen.
[1:03:42] And if you don't know what kind of fight
[1:03:45] to fight, you may become the first
[1:03:47] casualty.
[1:03:48] Amen. Because if you don't take it
[1:03:50] serious, when you go to boot camp and
[1:03:53] they teach you the art of war,
[1:03:56] why do you have an army that doesn't
[1:03:58] know how to fight?
[1:04:02] What good would that be? What good would
[1:04:04] it have to have cannons and guns and and
[1:04:08] swords and all the weapons of warfare if
[1:04:11] you're not trained in it?
[1:04:13] Amen.
[1:04:15] So it is with with the Christian.
[1:04:18] And we're going to find out, saints of
[1:04:20] God, that every one of you are called to
[1:04:23] be a soldier in this army.
[1:04:26] Amen.
[1:04:28] Now, the army has all kinds of duties in
[1:04:30] it. And there are some that are going to
[1:04:33] be combatant and there are going to be
[1:04:36] some that are 1A.
[1:04:39] 1A is fit for combatant duty. 1A is
[1:04:44] combatant
[1:04:45] is a non-combatant duty and is a
[1:04:48] conscientious objector that says, "I'll
[1:04:52] cook, but I won't pick up a rifle."
[1:04:55] So, let me tell you, some of you will
[1:04:57] never be on the front line as far as
[1:05:01] picking up rifles and charging the
[1:05:03] enemy, but you'll be cooking, feeding
[1:05:05] those that are doing it.
[1:05:07] So, you've all got a job. Don't sit
[1:05:09] there and act like, "Well, I ain't got
[1:05:10] nothing to do and I ain't very
[1:05:12] important." You're all very important
[1:05:13] because if the men don't have something,
[1:05:15] what do you think David was doing when
[1:05:17] he came to his brothers who were in
[1:05:18] battle?
[1:05:20] His father said, "Take him something to
[1:05:22] eat."
[1:05:24] Little did David know that the very
[1:05:26] things that he had gone through
[1:05:29] prepared him to meet Goliath.
[1:05:33] The lion and the bear. Let me say this
[1:05:35] to every one of you. Your life, your
[1:05:38] trials, your tribulations, your things,
[1:05:41] your lions, your bears, the situations
[1:05:44] you've had in your life is preparatory
[1:05:47] for you for battles down
[1:05:50] in the future. Yes, sir.
[1:05:52] Because the same God that delivered me
[1:05:55] from the bear is the same God that will
[1:05:58] deliver me from the lion, which is the
[1:06:00] same God which will deliver me from the
[1:06:03] forces of Ladya, which will make me an
[1:06:06] overcomer because
[1:06:09] I can do all things.
[1:06:12] Somebody say, "All things."
[1:06:13] All things
[1:06:14] through Christ who strengthens me.
[1:06:17] Thank you, sir.
[1:06:18] You've been made
[1:06:20] more than a conqueror.
[1:06:24] Yes, sir.
[1:06:24] Amen.
[1:06:27] There is a spiritual conflict taking
[1:06:29] place.
[1:06:31] It started in heaven, was cast down to
[1:06:33] earth.
[1:06:35] So, we realize there are right now two
[1:06:38] kingdoms in conflict.
[1:06:39] Amen.
[1:06:45] It is the kingdom of heaven
[1:06:49] with life,
[1:06:51] freedom,
[1:06:53] and the things of God. And there is the
[1:06:56] kingdom of hell, which is death and
[1:07:00] darkness,
[1:07:01] and the things that belong to hell.
[1:07:04] Amen.
[1:07:05] Now I want you to understand that
[1:07:07] depending upon the seed that you have
[1:07:10] within you
[1:07:12] will show to you that you must be about
[1:07:15] your father's business.
[1:07:19] So depending on who your father is
[1:07:23] depends on how you'll manifest.
[1:07:26] You understand that? Amen.
[1:07:30] So God help us then that we might be
[1:07:33] about's
[1:07:35] business
[1:07:37] because there should be a spirit inside
[1:07:40] crying out abba father.
[1:07:41] Amen.
[1:07:42] That our spirit is bearing witness with
[1:07:45] his spirit that we are now the sons of
[1:07:48] god.
[1:07:48] Hallelujah.
[1:07:49] Not that we will be. We are now. And let
[1:07:51] me say this that
[1:07:53] if you are now you always were.
[1:07:57] Amen.
[1:08:02] It wasn't because of your works.
[1:08:05] It wasn't because well, when I come to
[1:08:07] the message, then God received me. Then
[1:08:09] God did. No, let me tell you. For by
[1:08:11] grace. Somebody say grace.
[1:08:14] Are you saved through faith? Somebody
[1:08:16] say faith. So the faith which is not of
[1:08:20] you. It's a gift.
[1:08:22] Thank you, Lord.
[1:08:23] God gave it to you.
[1:08:24] Hallelujah. It wasn't you. It wasn't you
[1:08:27] praying for it. It wasn't something that
[1:08:29] you said, "Oh, God, give me faith. Give
[1:08:31] me the
[1:08:33] You know what God did before the
[1:08:35] foundation of the world? He placed on
[1:08:37] your finger unmarited favor."
[1:08:40] And he said, "Because you are seen, I
[1:08:43] will give you faith because faith is the
[1:08:46] victory."
[1:08:47] [Applause]
[1:08:49] Revelation is the victory that overcomes
[1:08:52] the world.
[1:08:54] Yes sir.
[1:08:56] Thank you Lord.
[1:08:58] Now
[1:09:00] we are rapidly approaching the battle of
[1:09:03] Armageddon.
[1:09:05] Now
[1:09:08] in Revelation 16
[1:09:10] the Bible says verses 12- 16. And the
[1:09:15] sixth angel poured out his vial upon the
[1:09:18] great river Euphrates, and the water
[1:09:20] thereof was dried up, that the way of
[1:09:23] the kings of east might be prepared. And
[1:09:25] I saw three unclean spirits
[1:09:28] like frogs come out of the mouth of the
[1:09:30] dragon, out of the mouth of the beast,
[1:09:33] and out of the mouth of the false
[1:09:35] prophet. Here's the trinity of the
[1:09:37] enemy.
[1:09:38] Amen.
[1:09:39] Dragon, beast, false prophet. For they
[1:09:43] are spirits of devils. Somebody say
[1:09:45] spirits.
[1:09:46] Spirits.
[1:09:47] We fight not against flesh and blood,
[1:09:49] but against principalities, against
[1:09:52] power spirits.
[1:09:53] That's right.
[1:09:56] Every one of you
[1:09:58] are going to at some time have the enemy
[1:10:02] work on you by an evil spirit.
[1:10:08] And you're going to have to know how to
[1:10:11] combat against it.
[1:10:13] Some of you say, "Oh, brother Ron, I've
[1:10:15] got such terrible thoughts and this and
[1:10:17] that." And brother Bram said, "Well, the
[1:10:18] greatest battle ever fought is where?
[1:10:21] The mind." That's why Paul said, "Take
[1:10:24] captive every thought and make it
[1:10:26] subject to the mind of Christ."
[1:10:30] Well, if I was really a son of God, I
[1:10:33] wouldn't think those thoughts. Brother
[1:10:35] Ram said, he said, "Now watch the the
[1:10:39] devil will send you thoughts.
[1:10:42] Do you know that you are to take the
[1:10:44] shield of faith
[1:10:46] whereby you may quench the fiery darts?"
[1:10:48] You know what fiery darts are?
[1:10:50] Evil thoughts.
[1:10:55] Brother Roy Borders, Brother Brennham's
[1:10:57] manager. I took him hunting. We were up
[1:10:59] in Colorado
[1:11:01] and I I I took him hunting for two or
[1:11:04] three days. He had a a late stage of
[1:11:07] cancer
[1:11:09] and the rest of the brothers were there.
[1:11:10] But my pastor told me, "Brother Ron, you
[1:11:13] you know horses. He can't walk down to
[1:11:16] the blind where he's going to sit to try
[1:11:18] to get an elk." He said, "So, I want you
[1:11:21] to take him by horseback down there and
[1:11:24] everything." And so I took him uh you
[1:11:26] know, we would go together and ride down
[1:11:28] there together. And I had a wonderful
[1:11:31] time with brother Roy. But one morning
[1:11:33] he he woke up and he said, "Brother Ron,
[1:11:36] I don't feel well enough to get on the
[1:11:39] horse and go down there. Can we just sit
[1:11:42] in the cabin?" I said, "That'd be fine."
[1:11:45] So we sat and we fellowshipped and he
[1:11:47] began to share with me different things
[1:11:50] and testimonies of what it was like
[1:11:52] being with brother Brennham. He said, 'I
[1:11:55] will tell you of a my own testimony. He
[1:11:58] said, "Brother Ron, when brother
[1:12:00] Brennham would have the prayer line of
[1:12:02] people that are very sick and
[1:12:04] everything," and he says they would come
[1:12:05] up from the right and he said, "Why did
[1:12:08] they always come to the right?" Because
[1:12:09] the angel of the Lord stood to brother
[1:12:12] Brandham's right.
[1:12:13] Amen. So they would first come into the
[1:12:16] presence of the angel and you can see
[1:12:19] this in the movies where they come and
[1:12:21] they get a little shocked and he said oh
[1:12:23] no that's just his presence
[1:12:26] and brother Roy says I was usually the
[1:12:29] closest one to bring them to the prophet
[1:12:34] and he says as they're coming and I
[1:12:36] would say okay come now and they would
[1:12:38] come into brother he says brother Ron I
[1:12:40] would think horrible ungodly thoughts
[1:12:44] and he says, "Oh my, there must be
[1:12:46] something wrong with me." He said, "I'm
[1:12:50] going to I'm just going to have to ask
[1:12:52] Brother Brandham about it. He's going to
[1:12:54] have to pray for me because I have all
[1:12:56] these thoughts."
[1:12:58] And so after the service was over on one
[1:13:01] of the services,
[1:13:03] he asked Brother Brennham, he said, "Can
[1:13:05] I meet with you tomorrow morning?" "Yes,
[1:13:08] Brother Roy. That's fine."
[1:13:10] And when they got together, he said,
[1:13:12] "Brother Roy, I know why you're here."
[1:13:17] You see, he'd already discerned it.
[1:13:19] He says, "You're you're wondering why
[1:13:23] you have these thoughts, ungodly
[1:13:25] thoughts,
[1:13:27] while you're closest to me in the prayer
[1:13:30] line, and how could you have the Holy
[1:13:32] Ghost and have these thoughts?" He said,
[1:13:35] "Brother Roy, let me tell you, they're
[1:13:37] not your thoughts. Quit owning them.
[1:13:40] The enemy is trying to bombard your
[1:13:42] mind. Quit. I'm going to tell all of
[1:13:44] you, quit owning those thoughts.
[1:13:47] Bring it captive. You're subject to the
[1:13:50] mind of Christ.
[1:13:52] It's not your thoughts.
[1:13:54] And he said, brother Roy, he says, you
[1:13:56] know what he says? Those thoughts come
[1:13:58] to me first.
[1:14:01] And because I take the shield of faith
[1:14:05] and he says what it does, it ricochets
[1:14:07] off of my shield and hits the one
[1:14:10] closest to me and you just happen to be
[1:14:13] closest to me.
[1:14:15] So no matter how close you are to a man
[1:14:18] of God, to a prophet of God,
[1:14:22] or somebody that is close to God,
[1:14:25] that doesn't keep you from your
[1:14:27] spiritual warfare. In fact,
[1:14:31] just go with a minister on a missionary
[1:14:34] trip and then come back and you know
[1:14:37] what? Your work is falling apart.
[1:14:40] There's all kinds of stuff. Oh my,
[1:14:42] you're getting bombarded. I tell people
[1:14:44] if you go with me on a missionary trip,
[1:14:46] be ready to have a battle when you get
[1:14:48] home.
[1:14:50] In fact, I've learned even with a cell
[1:14:52] phone, I usually don't stay in contact
[1:14:54] with Sandy while I'm off in uh there
[1:14:58] because you know what? Oh, honey, how
[1:15:00] you doing? Oh, hey, something happened.
[1:15:03] You know, this this and
[1:15:06] it just tears me up, right? So, I I say,
[1:15:10] "Tell me when I get home. I'll deal with
[1:15:13] it when I get home."
[1:15:16] And and so we find out we're in a very s
[1:15:19] tough spiritual battle. So Roy said, Roy
[1:15:23] said, "Brother Ron, once he told me the
[1:15:26] key
[1:15:28] that it's not my thoughts,
[1:15:31] and he says he battled the very same
[1:15:34] thing."
[1:15:35] Okay.
[1:15:37] He said once I realized that, it never
[1:15:40] bothered me again.
[1:15:42] Hallelujah. May that be a key factor for
[1:15:46] many of you that are sitting here
[1:15:48] wondering, "If I was truly a son of God,
[1:15:51] if I truly had the Holy Ghost, how could
[1:15:54] I think these thoughts?" They're not
[1:15:55] your thoughts. It's the devil.
[1:15:58] Rebuke him.
[1:16:01] Yes, sir.
[1:16:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:02] I had one brother come to me one time,
[1:16:04] Brother Ron, I don't know, sometimes I I
[1:16:06] just say, "The Lord rebuke you." I just
[1:16:08] get all and I yell at him. He said, "But
[1:16:11] it doesn't seem to help." I said, "You
[1:16:13] don't have to yell at him. You don't
[1:16:15] have to scream at him."
[1:16:18] I said, "You know what? If you want to
[1:16:19] confuse him, just start praising the
[1:16:21] Lord."
[1:16:22] He goes, "What?" I said, "Yeah, next
[1:16:25] time you have a bad thought, say,
[1:16:26] "Praise God. I'll tell you what." God
[1:16:29] has said you I And the devil's going,
[1:16:31] "Wait a second. Wait a second. Hey, hey,
[1:16:33] hey. Didn't you little demons tell me
[1:16:36] that his frequency was so and so?"
[1:16:39] Yeah. Yeah, he did. and and all these
[1:16:41] years he's been receiving the same
[1:16:43] frequency. It's still the same. But why
[1:16:45] is why is he rejoicing?
[1:16:48] He's not receiving it.
[1:16:50] I want you to understand when you don't
[1:16:53] receive it, you block him.
[1:16:56] Like you do somebody on your phone. Hey,
[1:16:58] block that guy.
[1:17:00] I don't want to hear from him.
[1:17:03] Hallelujah.
[1:17:04] We need to block the enemy. We need to
[1:17:06] take those thoughts and make them
[1:17:08] subject to the very mind of Christ.
[1:17:12] It's not you.
[1:17:20] Revelation 16. I told you we are rapidly
[1:17:23] coming
[1:17:26] um to the battle of Armageddon.
[1:17:32] In verse 14 as we continue reading
[1:17:34] Revelations
[1:17:36] 16,
[1:17:38] for they are spirits of the devil
[1:17:41] working miracles. Can devils work
[1:17:44] miracles?
[1:17:46] Sure.
[1:17:48] So it's not by the anointing do we judge
[1:17:51] it. It's not by the miracles
[1:17:54] because we know that even the false
[1:17:56] prophet and the antichrist will call
[1:17:59] fire from heaven, do all kinds of signs
[1:18:01] and wonders and by those will deceive
[1:18:04] many.
[1:18:05] Amen.
[1:18:06] So we don't follow the signs.
[1:18:10] Signs
[1:18:12] follow the believer.
[1:18:15] Amen.
[1:18:19] which go forth unto the kings of the
[1:18:21] earth and of the whole world to gather
[1:18:24] them to the battle of that great day of
[1:18:27] God Almighty. So what are they gathering
[1:18:30] for? A great battle.
[1:18:32] It's coming, saints.
[1:18:33] Amen.
[1:18:34] Behold, I come as a thief. Who comes as
[1:18:36] a thief?
[1:18:37] God does.
[1:18:39] He's going to take away his bride
[1:18:42] as a thief in the night. It's a secret
[1:18:45] sudden catching away of the bride.
[1:18:48] Amen.
[1:18:50] Blessed is he that watchth and keepeth
[1:18:53] his garments, lest he walk naked and see
[1:18:56] and they see his shame. And he gathered
[1:18:59] them together into a place called in the
[1:19:02] Hebrew tongue
[1:19:04] Armageddon.
[1:19:06] Now, Brother Brandham picks this up
[1:19:09] in the first seal.
[1:19:11] Now, watch this. He says, "Now notice
[1:19:14] nicatia." How many know that nicotin
[1:19:17] spirit is to divide and conquer?
[1:19:20] Anything that comes among the bride and
[1:19:23] divides us instead of unites us is a
[1:19:26] wrong spirit.
[1:19:27] That's right.
[1:19:28] We're to be separated from unbelief, not
[1:19:30] from one another.
[1:19:33] Even if we disagree with one another,
[1:19:36] because it's just your viewpoint usually
[1:19:40] what we disagree on.
[1:19:42] He's coming on a white horse. No, he's
[1:19:45] coming on a white cloud. Brother Ram
[1:19:47] said, "Really doesn't matter
[1:19:48] as long as we agree he's coming."
[1:19:53] Amen.
[1:19:54] So much of the time we're trying to
[1:19:55] prove our point
[1:19:56] with somebody else.
[1:19:59] And you know what? They're not listening
[1:20:00] for you to finish and prove your point.
[1:20:02] And then they go, "Oh, okay. Thank you.
[1:20:04] I'm I stand correct." And most of the
[1:20:06] time they just want to argue and debate.
[1:20:08] Amen.
[1:20:10] How do you How many of you know that
[1:20:12] Satan is the world's greatest sophist?
[1:20:15] You know what sophist means?
[1:20:17] Debater.
[1:20:19] He wants to debate you.
[1:20:22] And it doesn't matter what viewpoint you
[1:20:23] take, he's going to take the opposite.
[1:20:25] Any of you ever have debate class in in
[1:20:27] high school? And they gave you the
[1:20:30] opposite of what you believed.
[1:20:33] And I said, "Okay, now I want you to
[1:20:34] debate it and try to give a logical,
[1:20:37] reasonable debate. Don't just get up
[1:20:39] there." Well, I just think that's wrong.
[1:20:42] No pro. Why is it wrong?
[1:20:46] But I think some of you had debate class
[1:20:49] in school and you learned it quite well
[1:20:52] and so you
[1:20:55] you like to debate. Now, the Bible says,
[1:20:58] "Come, let us reason together." didn't
[1:21:00] say debate together.
[1:21:02] Come now, let us reason together. And if
[1:21:05] you have the right attitude and the
[1:21:06] right spirit, you're teachable.
[1:21:11] You're teachable. You're not sitting
[1:21:13] there waiting for him. Are you done? Are
[1:21:15] you done? Now, I'm going to prove my
[1:21:17] point.
[1:21:18] I'm to the place anymore. In fact, I was
[1:21:20] just with some of the brothers up there
[1:21:21] in South Carolina, and we were just
[1:21:23] talking. We sitting and I I said,
[1:21:25] "Brethren, my days of debating are over.
[1:21:29] Amen.
[1:21:29] I said, "Even if we see it differently."
[1:21:32] I said, "I want to major on what we
[1:21:34] agree on, not what we disagree on."
[1:21:36] Amen.
[1:21:37] Yes, sir.
[1:21:38] Because every church is sovereign in
[1:21:40] itself
[1:21:41] in the way they worship, in the way that
[1:21:43] they do their sound and their music and
[1:21:45] whatever.
[1:21:47] Well, that ain't the way we do it.
[1:21:51] Well,
[1:21:53] so what?
[1:21:56] I I I I went to I was down in Spain and
[1:22:00] there was a gypsy church.
[1:22:03] Gypsy church. And these gypsies, you
[1:22:06] know, they come they come out of the
[1:22:08] world. They're rough. They're gypsies,
[1:22:10] man. Hey. Anyway, I was there and they
[1:22:14] had they had big old amplifier. They
[1:22:17] didn't have these little tiny amplifiers
[1:22:19] and stuff. No, they had big old Fender
[1:22:23] amplifiers. And the two guys that played
[1:22:26] the guitar, I think it was a battle of
[1:22:28] the bands,
[1:22:31] they had it cranked up and
[1:22:37] dancing around everything. I'm think my
[1:22:39] it was so loud that I had to walk out of
[1:22:43] the service and I said, "Just tell me
[1:22:45] when when you're ready for me to come
[1:22:48] preach the word
[1:22:50] because it really was so loud." Well,
[1:22:53] they thought it was great.
[1:22:55] They just
[1:22:58] Well, I'm not there to try to correct
[1:23:00] them on the way that they play their
[1:23:03] music. First off, they won't receive
[1:23:05] correction from me unless they love me.
[1:23:08] Amen.
[1:23:11] I think one of the most sweetest, loving
[1:23:13] quotes from the prophet of God himself
[1:23:16] as he said these words
[1:23:19] and when you hear him say it,
[1:23:22] it captivates your heart because it's
[1:23:25] the way he says it.
[1:23:28] Father God,
[1:23:30] let the people love me
[1:23:34] that I can bring them to you.
[1:23:38] So
[1:23:41] too much of the time we dwell upon we
[1:23:44] want people to like us and love us and
[1:23:46] everything and you want to have so many
[1:23:48] likes on your Instagram and this and
[1:23:50] that and Facebook and YouTube and likes
[1:23:54] and everybody wants to be liked. Of
[1:23:55] course we all want to be I want to be
[1:23:57] liked.
[1:23:59] We all want to be liked.
[1:24:02] But I would rather be liked by him.
[1:24:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:24:07] I would rather have a friend in Jesus
[1:24:10] than all the friends in the world.
[1:24:15] God help us
[1:24:17] to have the right choice
[1:24:19] of who we call friends.
[1:24:21] Amen.
[1:24:22] Now,
[1:24:25] all right. First seal. Notice Niclatia.
[1:24:28] The antichrist teaching started in the
[1:24:30] days of Paul against God's word. So, it
[1:24:33] started in the first church age.
[1:24:34] Antichrist. Then he's called the false
[1:24:37] prophet
[1:24:39] which when the teaching become a man he
[1:24:43] was a prophet to the teaching of the
[1:24:45] hierarchy or the hierarchy of the
[1:24:47] Catholic church. The pope was the
[1:24:50] prophet to the false word
[1:24:52] and that made him a false prophet.
[1:24:56] The third stage is a beast.
[1:25:00] a man that's crowned in the last days
[1:25:03] and every power that pagan Rome ever had
[1:25:06] become the sevenheaded beast or dragon
[1:25:10] that was cast out of heaven and come
[1:25:13] incarnate
[1:25:16] in the false prophet.
[1:25:18] Here it is. He had seven crowns
[1:25:22] and he was cast out and thrown into the
[1:25:25] earth and the sea. All right. What are
[1:25:28] we saying? Who is this rider?
[1:25:31] This horse rider? You know what it is?
[1:25:35] It's Satan's Superman.
[1:25:38] Any of you ever remember Superman?
[1:25:41] Faster than a speeding bullet. Able to
[1:25:44] leap tall buildings with a single bound.
[1:25:47] You know, hey, I remember as a kid, you
[1:25:49] know, you believe everything you see on
[1:25:51] television. That guy, he had a cape. So,
[1:25:53] my mother made me a cape on. I told you.
[1:25:56] I went around. And I was running around
[1:25:58] the yard and watching the cape fly
[1:25:59] behind me and finally I said, "I'm going
[1:26:01] to fly."
[1:26:03] So I got up and we had a station wagon
[1:26:07] and I got on top of the station wagon. I
[1:26:09] told everybody, "Move back." I had all
[1:26:10] the kids from the neighborhood lined up.
[1:26:12] I said, "Now look, I've never flown
[1:26:14] before, so I don't know how fast and how
[1:26:16] far."
[1:26:19] This is the truth, man. cuz I Hey, I I
[1:26:22] really I was quite excited and I'm okay,
[1:26:25] you know. And so I jumped off and I put
[1:26:28] my arms like that and I did a belly flop
[1:26:30] on the ground. Knocked all the air out
[1:26:32] of me and I remember going but in my
[1:26:36] mind I'm going why didn't I fly?
[1:26:41] Now I want you to understand Satan's
[1:26:43] Superman.
[1:26:46] This is going to be a guy
[1:26:49] that is going to have all the answers.
[1:26:52] He's going to bring the world and the
[1:26:54] Bible says and watch him in this end
[1:26:57] time because the antichrist is going to
[1:27:00] deceive all those whose names are not
[1:27:03] written in the lamb's book of life. So
[1:27:06] the only people who will not be
[1:27:08] deceived,
[1:27:11] the deception
[1:27:13] is going to be so powerful
[1:27:18] that they will believe a lie and be
[1:27:21] damned
[1:27:23] because it's a spirit,
[1:27:24] right?
[1:27:26] And the spirit wants to incarnate.
[1:27:29] In other words, it wants to come into.
[1:27:31] Do you realize it's just a false
[1:27:35] impersonation of what God's doing?
[1:27:38] God wants to become incarnate.
[1:27:41] In fact, he's going to be
[1:27:43] he's going to incarnate himself because
[1:27:46] he started
[1:27:49] at Pentecost.
[1:27:51] Acts chapter 2.
[1:27:53] Exactly.
[1:27:54] And he says, "In not many days hence
[1:27:58] I will come to you.
[1:28:00] I'll be with you. I'll be even in you.
[1:28:04] They didn't know how's it going to be.
[1:28:07] Is it going to be a feeling?
[1:28:08] Is it I felt it.
[1:28:12] I get shivers.
[1:28:14] Hey, people get all kinds of sensations
[1:28:18] through all kinds of different things.
[1:28:21] You know, some people like artwork. Oo,
[1:28:24] isn't it beautiful? They hear a song.
[1:28:27] Oo.
[1:28:32] I never did like a girl when she take
[1:28:34] them out on a date and the radio's going
[1:28:36] and they Oh, they hear a song. Oh,
[1:28:39] Johnny.
[1:28:42] Johnny, you're with Ronnie. Honey,
[1:28:48] get out of the car. You like Johnny, go
[1:28:50] with him.
[1:28:53] Anyway,
[1:28:57] all right.
[1:28:59] Satan, Superman. This is the trinity.
[1:29:02] Listen to me. It's the trinity of Satan,
[1:29:05] right?
[1:29:07] They are spiritual powers now fighting
[1:29:09] against the seed of God. The conflict
[1:29:12] started in heaven was cast down to
[1:29:14] earth.
[1:29:16] And the first conflict we see is between
[1:29:19] two
[1:29:19] seeds.
[1:29:22] Cain and Abel.
[1:29:24] And it was because of the way they
[1:29:25] worshiped.
[1:29:27] And it was because one was received and
[1:29:29] the other was rejected. And because one
[1:29:31] was rejected, his countenance fell. And
[1:29:34] he argued with God
[1:29:36] because God said, "Why is thy
[1:29:38] countenance fallen? Why are you upset?
[1:29:40] Will I not receive you if you give the
[1:29:44] right sacrifice?
[1:29:48] You see, understand Cain's seed doesn't
[1:29:52] care about
[1:29:56] what kind of sacrifice they just want to
[1:29:59] give.
[1:30:01] Doesn't matter.
[1:30:03] That's why the people with voodoo and
[1:30:04] witch doctors and different things, they
[1:30:06] bring alcohol,
[1:30:08] cigars,
[1:30:11] cigarettes,
[1:30:13] they make a little altar and they pour
[1:30:15] out whiskey,
[1:30:18] right? They give some kind of sacrifice
[1:30:21] thinking, "Hey, that's what God wants."
[1:30:24] Do you think God receives every kind of
[1:30:27] worship?
[1:30:28] Because Jesus said, "They that worship
[1:30:31] me must worship me in spirit and in
[1:30:34] truth."
[1:30:35] Because you can worship in spirit and
[1:30:37] not have truth. And you can be all
[1:30:39] spiritual and ex and and worshiping God.
[1:30:43] And he says, "In vain do they worship
[1:30:45] me, teaching for doctrine commandments
[1:30:48] of men."
[1:30:49] Amen. Amen.
[1:30:51] So Cain rose up and his anger and the
[1:30:57] fruits of his father came forth from him
[1:31:00] because he's a liar and a murderer and
[1:31:03] he was so in the beginning. So what does
[1:31:05] he do? He rises up in a jealousy and he
[1:31:08] slays his brother Abel. Did you know the
[1:31:12] prophet of God said that Abel was killed
[1:31:15] on the very same altar that he made his
[1:31:18] sacrifice?
[1:31:20] That's interesting.
[1:31:23] So he
[1:31:25] Cain got so upset.
[1:31:27] That's why
[1:31:29] religious people get upset
[1:31:33] when you tell them
[1:31:35] about that God doesn't receive every
[1:31:37] kind of worship.
[1:31:40] But now true seed, you can't offend them
[1:31:43] with that.
[1:31:44] Amen.
[1:31:44] Because they go, "Really?"
[1:31:46] Wow.
[1:31:48] Do you see? Because I want to know, tell
[1:31:51] me what kind of sacrifice I should give.
[1:31:55] That's why this message,
[1:31:58] saints of God, it tells us what to do,
[1:32:02] how to prepare, how to give a sacrifice,
[1:32:05] how to approach God. Because if you
[1:32:07] don't know how to approach God, then you
[1:32:09] just think, well, God accepts anything
[1:32:11] and he doesn't.
[1:32:17] So all of us were born into this
[1:32:20] conflict. We came into the world.
[1:32:23] We bypassed our theophony. Came down
[1:32:26] here into the world speaking lies. You
[1:32:29] don't have to teach babies how to lie.
[1:32:31] You don't have to teach them how to
[1:32:33] boogie. You take a baby and put them in
[1:32:35] front of a speaker and put on uh worldly
[1:32:38] music and
[1:32:41] and a little baby never heard it before
[1:32:42] and all of a sudden they boogie.
[1:32:46] Why? It's their nature.
[1:32:50] Brother Brennham said, "You take rock
[1:32:52] and roll music and let it be played and
[1:32:56] anoint those children before they get
[1:32:58] the Holy Ghost. It'll it'll anoint them.
[1:33:03] It'll bring them into it.
[1:33:05] They'll start getting into the spirit.
[1:33:08] And I remember um I I tell you now, I've
[1:33:12] had the Holy Ghost
[1:33:15] since I was a young man. Came into this
[1:33:17] message, got the Holy Ghost, got rid of
[1:33:20] rock and roll music, got away from it.
[1:33:22] But uh a brother took me to a
[1:33:24] professional basketball game, the
[1:33:26] Phoenix Suns. Never I haven't been to a
[1:33:29] professional basketball game since.
[1:33:32] Well, he took me. Hey, man. We had nice
[1:33:34] seats. We were just a few rows up and
[1:33:36] and and everything. And in the coliseum
[1:33:38] over here and and they did the they dim
[1:33:40] the lights and they got these these
[1:33:42] stars.
[1:33:44] Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:33:48] your Phoenix sons
[1:33:52] like this. These guys passing the ball
[1:33:53] around, dunking it, slam dunk like this,
[1:33:56] shooting and everything. Everybody
[1:33:58] clapping. Yeah, that's that's our team
[1:34:00] defeating Sardons.
[1:34:03] Yeah. And then they start we will we we
[1:34:06] will rock you, man. I'll tell you the
[1:34:09] whole stadium, everybody, grandma and
[1:34:11] grandpa right next to me. We we we rock
[1:34:15] you. So I stood up. We No, I didn't. I
[1:34:19] didn't.
[1:34:21] But I felt like it. It was drawing me.
[1:34:24] And I said, I've got the Holy Ghost. And
[1:34:27] I said, "Thank God that I have a
[1:34:29] buffer."
[1:34:31] Otherwise, it pulls me into it.
[1:34:35] You see, the music that you had in your
[1:34:39] generation is a music that will affect
[1:34:42] you, not the preceding music.
[1:34:45] Huh?
[1:34:46] No, it's your music.
[1:34:48] I listen to the nonsense today with all
[1:34:51] of the and I I think, how can they
[1:34:54] listen to that stuff?
[1:34:57] But I can be I can be somewhere and
[1:35:01] you're you and and and they got the
[1:35:03] oldies of the late 60s and 70s which was
[1:35:07] my generation when I was a teenager
[1:35:10] and all of a sudden a song will come on
[1:35:12] right. Get your motor running head out
[1:35:16] on the I start playing the invisible
[1:35:18] guitar
[1:35:20] and my wife goes what are you doing? Oh,
[1:35:23] excuse me.
[1:35:26] It's because it had an effect.
[1:35:28] Amen.
[1:35:29] God, thank you that you have given me
[1:35:32] the buffer of the Holy Ghost that though
[1:35:34] these anointings will come around,
[1:35:36] though that these things
[1:35:39] that once had an effect that once I
[1:35:42] loved, I now hate,
[1:35:44] but I've got to be aware of it.
[1:35:47] It's there.
[1:35:48] Tries to anoint you, tries to pull you
[1:35:50] back.
[1:35:52] Amen.
[1:35:55] Okay. Now, now let's follow this. Now,
[1:35:57] we're going to go to the second seal.
[1:36:00] Brother Rem said, "But in the age after
[1:36:02] the church goes home," now he's talking
[1:36:04] about bride going home.
[1:36:07] "But in the age after the church goes
[1:36:09] home, he becomes a beast
[1:36:12] and he becomes a devil incarnate,
[1:36:16] the red dragon himself." Oh my. Can't
[1:36:19] you see what I mean? Now, we just read
[1:36:21] from from the first seal about his
[1:36:24] trinity. He's a beast. He's a dragon.
[1:36:27] He's a false prophet. So, here it is. He
[1:36:30] said the devil incarnate, the red dragon
[1:36:32] himself. Oh my. Can't you see it? He's
[1:36:34] incarnate in people. Then he's got the
[1:36:37] people bound by his power.
[1:36:41] The false prophet has prophesied them
[1:36:43] into it.
[1:36:45] The false prophet has prophesied
[1:36:49] them into it. Give them over to strong
[1:36:53] delusions to believe a lie and be damned
[1:36:56] by it.
[1:36:58] Denying the word with a form of
[1:37:01] godliness.
[1:37:02] Religion is only a covering. It's a form
[1:37:07] of godliness,
[1:37:08] but denies the power thereof. from such
[1:37:13] go to their church.
[1:37:18] It says turn away
[1:37:22] because there is a way that a man
[1:37:25] thinks but the end thereof is death.
[1:37:28] That's right.
[1:37:30] So now strong delusion given to people.
[1:37:32] So they'll believe a lie and be damned.
[1:37:36] So they have a form they have a
[1:37:38] religion.
[1:37:41] God works his place in a trinity.
[1:37:43] Justification, sanctific sanctification,
[1:37:47] and incarnate himself in his people with
[1:37:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You see
[1:37:52] the incarnation.
[1:37:54] The devil brings a spirit. The people
[1:37:57] get into it. He prophesies them his
[1:38:00] word. They believe it. They get under
[1:38:02] the influence of it and they incarnate.
[1:38:05] That's why. Have you seen how some of
[1:38:07] these people,
[1:38:09] I tell you, they want to look like
[1:38:11] Satan?
[1:38:13] Amen.
[1:38:15] I I I Where did this inspiration come
[1:38:18] from?
[1:38:20] They paint their skin a different color.
[1:38:23] Their eyes, their tongue, they split it.
[1:38:26] One guy cut his ears off. He cut his
[1:38:28] nose off. Cut his lips off.
[1:38:32] and they they look like a freak, an
[1:38:35] alien. Well, I want you to understand
[1:38:39] Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this
[1:38:42] world."
[1:38:44] He says, "But you are of your father,
[1:38:48] the devil,
[1:38:50] and his works you'll do." Look at that.
[1:38:54] He was a beast in the beginning. He'll
[1:38:57] be a beast at the end. And that's why
[1:38:59] these people are are are being possessed
[1:39:03] of spirits. They they think they're a
[1:39:07] cat or a dog.
[1:39:10] Send your kids to school to modern
[1:39:13] public school now and let me tell you,
[1:39:16] it's a shocker.
[1:39:19] And schools of higher education are even
[1:39:21] worse.
[1:39:23] I'm going to say this to all of our
[1:39:25] college kids.
[1:39:28] You better have the Holy Ghost
[1:39:32] because you rub shoulders with those
[1:39:37] from the schools of education and
[1:39:40] learning
[1:39:44] from the tree of knowledge.
[1:39:47] Do you realize that Satan is the tree of
[1:39:51] knowledge? And what channel does he use
[1:39:53] most of the time to get to the people
[1:39:56] and their minds? He uses exactly the
[1:40:00] same channel that he used on Eve. And he
[1:40:03] got her to reason long enough. And Satan
[1:40:06] will use your channel of reasoning.
[1:40:11] Remember the five channels to the
[1:40:14] outward man. See, taste, smell, feel,
[1:40:16] hear, and touch.
[1:40:18] There's five channels to your spirit.
[1:40:21] memory, imagination, conscience,
[1:40:23] affection, and reason. So, he's going to
[1:40:26] anoint
[1:40:28] Satan would love to anoint your any one
[1:40:32] of the Hey, just imagine
[1:40:35] and he just then anoints your
[1:40:37] imagination,
[1:40:38] right?
[1:40:41] He wants to anoint your reasoning,
[1:40:44] okay? And the next thing you know, you
[1:40:47] you reason this
[1:40:50] and you get anointed with unbelief and
[1:40:53] then you wonder why you're having a hard
[1:40:56] time believing this message,
[1:41:02] saints of God. And
[1:41:04] I'm going to tell you that this message
[1:41:08] is a declaration of war.
[1:41:10] Amen.
[1:41:10] Amen.
[1:41:19] And you've got to understand
[1:41:22] and you catch a true revelation of why
[1:41:24] God sent a prophet.
[1:41:27] Then you tear down your thinking man's
[1:41:30] filter and you take God's filter from
[1:41:33] the word of God
[1:41:35] and then you see through the eyes of a
[1:41:37] prophet because a prophet is a seer.
[1:41:39] Amen.
[1:41:40] He sees things in its embryionic form
[1:41:45] before it's even recognized.
[1:41:47] Why? He says, "What's wrong with
[1:41:49] Tennessee Ernie
[1:41:52] and Elvis Presley
[1:41:54] and Pat Boon?"
[1:41:58] He said they were religious.
[1:42:00] Huh? He says Elvis was raised up in a
[1:42:04] Pentecostal church. That's where he
[1:42:06] started to sing.
[1:42:11] So understand all this. So brother
[1:42:13] Brennham is seeing something. Then
[1:42:14] brother Brennham sees the Beatles come
[1:42:16] along.
[1:42:17] Okay. I remember the first time on the
[1:42:21] Ed Sullivan show and it was past our
[1:42:24] bedtime, but my mother woke us up and
[1:42:26] said, "Ronald and Donald, that's my
[1:42:30] brother and I. Ronald and Donald, come
[1:42:33] in here and watch because the Beatles
[1:42:36] are on Ed Sullivan. My sister, she's six
[1:42:39] years older and she so she was able to
[1:42:42] stay up later. So we got up out of bed.
[1:42:44] We come in there in our pajamas and and
[1:42:47] here's Ed Sullivan. You know, ladies and
[1:42:50] gentlemen,
[1:42:52] I want to to present you out of
[1:42:54] Liverpool, England. The Beatles.
[1:42:57] She loves you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and
[1:43:00] everything. And it took America by storm
[1:43:04] overnight.
[1:43:07] the this little rock band
[1:43:11] that all of a sudden and so now the
[1:43:14] movement under music,
[1:43:18] it absolutely revolutionized.
[1:43:22] And then as they got more into their
[1:43:24] music and they got weird and they they
[1:43:27] did all kinds of things
[1:43:30] and then you have the Rolling Stones
[1:43:32] come on and then you have all of these
[1:43:34] big groups and everything's coming on
[1:43:37] and America is taken by storm through
[1:43:41] rock and roll.
[1:43:45] Let me tell you, there's an anointing
[1:43:48] with rock music.
[1:43:52] And that's why brother Bram said, "Be
[1:43:55] careful what you listen to."
[1:43:57] Because the wrong kind of music
[1:44:01] brings an anointing with it.
[1:44:04] Wrong kind of music
[1:44:06] brings the wrong kind of anointing.
[1:44:08] That's why even within the church, God
[1:44:11] help us to not infiltrate
[1:44:14] by bringing the wrong kind of music
[1:44:18] and just put words about Jesus in it and
[1:44:21] we think it's okay.
[1:44:26] Just think about that. Amen.
[1:44:28] Because you know the reason the people
[1:44:30] are getting the moving, the reason that
[1:44:31] they're dancing. Huh?
[1:44:34] Is not because uh it's a Holy Ghost
[1:44:37] song.
[1:44:38] It's a song that's got a beat. Now, I'm
[1:44:41] not wrong. I I'm not against something
[1:44:43] with a beat. I like something with a
[1:44:44] beat.
[1:44:46] I do. Well, I got to prove I'm one in a
[1:44:51] million and I've got to show
[1:44:55] the power of the blood. It's got a
[1:44:58] little bit of a bee, a little
[1:44:59] Trinidadian. Yeah, I I I don't mind
[1:45:02] that. But the next thing you know, you
[1:45:04] watch if everybody's clapping and
[1:45:06] everybody's moving. Okay. Just because
[1:45:08] of the beat,
[1:45:10] be careful.
[1:45:12] Amen. That's right. Amen.
[1:45:14] That's all.
[1:45:16] Brother Rev said, "You parents
[1:45:19] watch what your kids listen to."
[1:45:23] Well, if they close their door, their
[1:45:24] room is private, and I honor their
[1:45:27] privacy.
[1:45:29] You do? Well, I thought you're head of
[1:45:31] the house.
[1:45:33] I thought that what goes on in your
[1:45:34] house, you're responsible for. So young
[1:45:37] people understand mom and dad are
[1:45:40] looking after your soul
[1:45:43] and are trying to
[1:45:47] make sure that you're not getting
[1:45:48] influenced in the wrong direction. And
[1:45:50] I'll tell you one of and I'm getting
[1:45:53] ahead of myself, but I'm going to say
[1:45:54] this anyway.
[1:45:57] One of the ways to realize that you're
[1:45:59] dealing with the influence of a seducing
[1:46:01] spirits is wrong attitude.
[1:46:03] Amen.
[1:46:06] You can't tell me what to do.
[1:46:09] What makes you think you're right?
[1:46:11] Prove it to me.
[1:46:13] And the next thing you know, when your
[1:46:15] little sweet baby that you've raised up
[1:46:17] and they sang the songs, Jesus loves me,
[1:46:21] this I know, and they they quote John
[1:46:24] 3:16 and they've been good and
[1:46:26] everything. And all of a sudden they
[1:46:27] start getting to the age 12 years of age
[1:46:30] accountability and pretty soon and
[1:46:32] they're at school and they've got
[1:46:34] friends and this and that and then
[1:46:36] they're listening to some of their
[1:46:38] friends and they're having friends up.
[1:46:40] Be careful where you let your children
[1:46:43] spend the night.
[1:46:45] That's true.
[1:46:46] Amen. Amen.
[1:46:50] I remember Billy Paul telling me that uh
[1:46:54] because we were just asking brother
[1:46:56] Joseph and brother Billy when we
[1:46:57] traveled together. I said, "Was there
[1:46:59] times that brother Brennham let you guys
[1:47:02] uh go and spend a night?" Yeah. Yeah. He
[1:47:05] said, "In fact, Joe went and uh he was
[1:47:07] spending the night down the street from
[1:47:09] where brother Ren lived, just a few
[1:47:11] doors down, and he's staying there with
[1:47:13] some friends, and they got to telling
[1:47:15] spooky stories
[1:47:17] about devils and spooks and everything."
[1:47:20] And Joseph said, "Uh, yeah. Yeah." He
[1:47:22] said, "Man, a friend of mine was telling
[1:47:24] a story
[1:47:27] just, you know, because what you talk
[1:47:28] about,
[1:47:31] it comes around." That's
[1:47:32] right. And he says, "All of a sudden, a
[1:47:34] knock came on the door."
[1:47:37] "Oh, yes. Uh huh. Yes, Mr. Brandom."
[1:47:41] "Yeah, the kids are here." "Yeah, tell
[1:47:43] tell Joe I need to see him."
[1:47:46] And Joe comes and he said, "Joe, I think
[1:47:47] you need to come home."
[1:47:49] Why, Daddy? Because the stories you're
[1:47:50] telling are bringing around wrong
[1:47:53] spirits, and I don't want that around
[1:47:54] you.
[1:47:56] So, understand that what may seem
[1:47:58] innocent,
[1:48:01] okay? innocent talking about things
[1:48:05] influential in the world, okay, can have
[1:48:10] an influence upon you and it'll
[1:48:12] influence your children, influence your
[1:48:15] mind, and the next thing you know,
[1:48:17] you're questioning everything what you
[1:48:19] once believed.
[1:48:22] Then you're going to challenge your mom
[1:48:24] and dad.
[1:48:25] Well, that's what you believe. That
[1:48:27] ain't what I believe. So then they turn
[1:48:30] 18, they got a car, they drive, they go
[1:48:32] where they want.
[1:48:34] Now you got a problem.
[1:48:37] I pray that what you do is you get
[1:48:39] enough influence on them and train them
[1:48:42] up when they're yet
[1:48:45] so that when they get older and if they
[1:48:48] should have a problem and depart from
[1:48:50] the way, God will show them the way
[1:48:54] back. Amen.
[1:48:56] Train up a child in the way it should
[1:48:58] go.
[1:49:00] A lot of times, listen, some of your
[1:49:01] kids are going to act just like you did.
[1:49:05] Hard-headed, rebellious. What were you
[1:49:08] like before you got converted?
[1:49:10] Yeah.
[1:49:10] Huh?
[1:49:11] Yep. That's a true.
[1:49:15] And so, next thing you know, you know
[1:49:17] your kid, well, look, I ain't done
[1:49:19] nothing wrong.
[1:49:22] You have drugged me to church. You have
[1:49:24] drugged me here and there and so I
[1:49:26] really don't got nothing to get saved
[1:49:28] from. Let me tell you, you know what?
[1:49:29] You need to get saved from yourself.
[1:49:34] Amen.
[1:49:36] God forbid any of you young people have
[1:49:38] to go and do things wrong to feel
[1:49:43] that you have to have something to
[1:49:44] repent of. No. Repent of the very fact
[1:49:47] that you came into this world with a
[1:49:49] wrong spirit. You got the wrong nature.
[1:49:51] God, help me to overcome and have the
[1:49:55] spirit of God inside of me.
[1:49:57] Because the goodness of God leads you to
[1:50:00] repentance.
[1:50:01] Amen.
[1:50:02] Very good.
[1:50:05] Satan has so refined his drugs, his
[1:50:09] music, and his influence that let me
[1:50:11] tell you, just
[1:50:15] one hit.
[1:50:17] Huh? Just do one line.
[1:50:21] He's got you.
[1:50:24] My brother, my twin brother.
[1:50:29] It's his testimony.
[1:50:33] He said one line of cocaine. He said
[1:50:36] cocaine was my drug of choice.
[1:50:40] He says one line of cocaine
[1:50:43] was too much and a thousand was not
[1:50:46] enough.
[1:50:53] It is so powerful
[1:50:57] that all he wants you to do is to open a
[1:51:00] door.
[1:51:02] He just wants you just hey just try it.
[1:51:08] Don't you realize that the enemy is
[1:51:10] doing all that he can nowadays
[1:51:14] to destroy you?
[1:51:16] Amen.
[1:51:17] He won't smoke a cigarette, but you'll
[1:51:19] vape.
[1:51:22] Come on, brother. Preach it.
[1:51:35] I'm fighting.
[1:51:39] I'm trying to keep spirits away.
[1:51:41] Amen.
[1:51:43] And I need you parents
[1:51:46] to back me up.
[1:51:50] Because you know what?
[1:51:52] I'm trying to save your kids.
[1:51:55] I don't want to be a mean old ugly old
[1:51:58] man that's just, you know, no grace, no
[1:52:01] nothing. No. Let me tell you, if I could
[1:52:03] keep you from having to go into sin,
[1:52:06] I'll do anything I can.
[1:52:09] And sometimes when I see kids
[1:52:11] struggling, having a hard time, and they
[1:52:13] go off, I take it personally. You know
[1:52:16] why? I didn't preach it. I didn't preach
[1:52:18] it good enough.
[1:52:21] I should have dug around the tree more.
[1:52:26] Then I feel like a failure.
[1:52:30] Do you understand? I fight my battles,
[1:52:32] too.
[1:52:33] Okay? Because when somebody just goes
[1:52:36] away, it affects me.
[1:52:40] I don't want them to go.
[1:52:42] Amen.
[1:52:42] You understand? I'm talking about going
[1:52:43] to the world. I'm not talking about if
[1:52:45] you go to another church, God bless you.
[1:52:47] Go
[1:52:48] that.
[1:52:49] I'm not talking about that. But I'm
[1:52:52] talking about when kids walk away.
[1:52:54] When parents walk away,
[1:52:56] that's why it just starts so innocent.
[1:53:00] It starts so innocent.
[1:53:07] the final climactic battle because the
[1:53:10] next big battle that's coming. Now, I
[1:53:12] want you to stop here just a second.
[1:53:14] Think about
[1:53:15] that. This prophet that he was born, he
[1:53:18] was born in what year? 1909.
[1:53:22] What year did the first world war start?
[1:53:25] 1914. When did it end? 1918.
[1:53:29] So the prophet was born prior to the
[1:53:32] first world war.
[1:53:34] God starts dealing with him in 1933.
[1:53:39] When did the second world war start?
[1:53:42] Okay. So when we start looking, this
[1:53:44] prophet is given words. He's he's
[1:53:48] birthed before world wars. He's brought
[1:53:51] into commission between world wars. And
[1:53:55] now he's given a revelation before
[1:53:58] Armageddon.
[1:54:00] It's all about wars.
[1:54:02] Amen.
[1:54:04] You understand this? So when you see
[1:54:07] that God sends this prophet and he shows
[1:54:10] you
[1:54:12] that you've got to know how to fight to
[1:54:14] good fight that you might war a good
[1:54:17] warfare.
[1:54:22] So I want to show you some things from
[1:54:25] the scriptures here
[1:54:28] my
[1:54:30] God always calls Israel
[1:54:36] to arms by the sound of a trumpet.
[1:54:40] Let me show you in scripture. God rose
[1:54:42] up a man by the name of I don't know how
[1:54:45] you say his name. E H U D. Ehud. I don't
[1:54:49] know how you say it. Ehood,
[1:54:51] who killed King Eglon, the king of Moab.
[1:54:56] You remember how he killed him? Took a
[1:54:59] knife, went into his chamber. This guy
[1:55:02] was so fat
[1:55:05] that his hand got stuck,
[1:55:08] couldn't bring. Yeah, it sounds gross,
[1:55:10] but that's what happened.
[1:55:12] Okay, then he takes off. Okay, we're
[1:55:14] gonna That's That's in Judges 3 if you
[1:55:16] want to read it.
[1:55:19] So I want to show you here Judges 3 27.
[1:55:23] So now Ehud comes. He's just killed
[1:55:27] Eglon the king of Moab who is an enemy
[1:55:30] to Israel. Watch this. And it came to
[1:55:32] pass when he was come that he blew a
[1:55:35] trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim. And
[1:55:37] the children of Israel went down with
[1:55:39] him from the mount and he before them.
[1:55:42] And he said unto them, "Follow after me,
[1:55:44] for the Lord hath delivered your
[1:55:46] enemies, the Moabites, into your hand."
[1:55:49] In other words, listen, here is a guy
[1:55:51] that's saying, "Hey, we're going to
[1:55:52] battle, saints." He blows the trumpet.
[1:55:56] He gathers these people together. Verse
[1:55:58] 31. And after him came a man by the name
[1:56:02] of Shamgar,
[1:56:04] who was the son of Anchath, which slew
[1:56:06] of the Philistines, 600 men with an ox
[1:56:09] goat,
[1:56:10] and he also delivered Israel. Also
[1:56:13] remember in Judges chapter 6, three
[1:56:15] chapters later, there's a man by the
[1:56:17] name of Gideon.
[1:56:20] And he's hiding
[1:56:23] away from the enemy
[1:56:25] behind what was it? A threshing machine
[1:56:27] or something. He's the wine press or
[1:56:29] whatever. And he's hiding.
[1:56:32] Gideon,
[1:56:33] the almighty man of valor.
[1:56:38] Who you talking to?
[1:56:40] God was calling him
[1:56:44] and calling him what he was before he
[1:56:47] knew what he was.
[1:56:58] 634 But the spirit of the Lord came upon
[1:57:01] Gideon and he blew a trumpet.
[1:57:05] In fact, Gideon got all of the guys that
[1:57:07] follow him, "Hey, bring you a lantern
[1:57:09] and each of you a trumpet." You
[1:57:12] remember?
[1:57:12] Amen.
[1:57:16] Now, they always blew a trumpet at the
[1:57:20] gathering of Israel.
[1:57:24] And they always blew because in the
[1:57:26] Bible, in the Old Testament, they had
[1:57:29] two silver trumpets. And they blew one
[1:57:32] trumpet at the gathering of the camp.
[1:57:35] And he blew another trump at the moving
[1:57:37] of the camp.
[1:57:40] Okay? But God uses trumpets. He didn't
[1:57:43] use cell phones. They weren't invented
[1:57:44] in that day.
[1:57:46] Okay? He didn't send everybody a text
[1:57:48] message. He didn't send them an email.
[1:57:52] He didn't use a pager.
[1:57:55] He blew a trumpet.
[1:57:57] And so God used trumpets. I want to ask
[1:58:00] you, if God did that back then, if I,
[1:58:03] the Lord God, changed not, would he blow
[1:58:05] a trumpet in this day?
[1:58:06] Amen.
[1:58:08] Okay? Just going to show you, it's no
[1:58:11] different today. Mighty men of valor are
[1:58:13] gathered at the sound of a trumpet.
[1:58:16] His message declares that a battle is
[1:58:19] about to begin. and his message actually
[1:58:22] becomes a declaration of war. That's why
[1:58:25] my brother, my sister, they all loved
[1:58:28] brother Brennham until the opening of
[1:58:30] the seals.
[1:58:33] When the third pool came into its
[1:58:35] fullness,
[1:58:38] why in that little room? Why there?
[1:58:40] Because I'm going to meet you in there.
[1:58:43] This is not for Pentecostal babies.
[1:58:46] Don't try to tell him this.
[1:58:49] Okay.
[1:58:50] Why that tent? Why those things? There's
[1:58:55] It's a vision.
[1:58:57] He's coming into his ministry to realize
[1:59:01] that something's going to happen. This
[1:59:03] is the third pull. I'll meet you in
[1:59:06] there.
[1:59:09] Understand the third pull now is a
[1:59:12] separating pull.
[1:59:13] Amen. It's an offensive pull. No one was
[1:59:17] ever offended by the signs and wonders.
[1:59:21] There was nobody that when somebody was
[1:59:23] raised from the dead, other than the
[1:59:25] fact that they didn't believe it, but
[1:59:27] you know what? Nobody was offended.
[1:59:30] Nobody was offended. Turn water to wine.
[1:59:34] Nobody was offended by fishes and
[1:59:37] loaves.
[1:59:40] But when he changes his ministry
[1:59:43] and he says now except you eat of my
[1:59:46] flesh and drink of my blood you have no
[1:59:48] part with me. Now they said this a hard
[1:59:51] saying who can hear it. The Bible says
[1:59:53] and many of his disciples walked no more
[1:59:55] with him.
[1:59:57] So the third pull is a separating pull.
[1:59:59] That's why this ministry that's coming.
[2:00:01] Now watch this. He said, "Watch that
[2:00:03] third pole when it's used in the
[2:00:05] fullness of its power. And the last ones
[2:00:08] that are going to be preached to
[2:00:12] are the eternally lost,
[2:00:17] souls in prison.
[2:00:19] Go listen to it." He says, "Could it
[2:00:22] be?" It looks like it is so right now.
[2:00:25] Oh my god. I hope not because he said,
[2:00:28] "I I still got children out there.
[2:00:32] Go listen to it.
[2:00:33] He said the last thing of the third
[2:00:36] pull, it's to the church, for the bride,
[2:00:40] and to the eternally lost.
[2:00:42] You're not going to save the eternally
[2:00:44] lost. But you're going to preach to
[2:00:47] them. You're going to live a life that
[2:00:49] listen, do you think the life you live,
[2:00:52] they're going to rejoice over
[2:00:55] you and the way you live? Do you know
[2:00:58] that you are actually a threat to them?
[2:01:02] Do you know you bring condemnation?
[2:01:07] So they don't like being around you. Oh,
[2:01:12] you think you're better than me?
[2:01:14] Just cuz you go to church cuz you wear a
[2:01:16] dress.
[2:01:18] Oh, so you you you think you're better
[2:01:22] now. God help us to not look down at
[2:01:24] anybody.
[2:01:26] Don't you dare look down your nose at
[2:01:28] anybody. And we get somebody to come
[2:01:30] here.
[2:01:32] My son invited I'm going to just share
[2:01:34] with this because I bear the shame of
[2:01:37] what some of you did.
[2:01:40] My son invited one of his friends who
[2:01:43] just got out of prison.
[2:01:46] His family is not believers. He's not a
[2:01:48] believer, but he invited him to our
[2:01:50] little family night that we had during
[2:01:53] the time what what do Halloween. We
[2:01:56] don't let our kids trick or treat. So,
[2:01:57] we have a So, the family came and guess
[2:02:01] what? They had stopped somewhere and the
[2:02:02] kids had their faces painted and the
[2:02:05] wife came and she wasn't dressed very
[2:02:07] nice and looked very worldly.
[2:02:12] And some of you said some very harsh
[2:02:14] remarks to them personally.
[2:02:21] This man spoke to my son Amos the other
[2:02:24] day and he said, "Uh, my I'll never get
[2:02:27] my family to come back to your church
[2:02:28] again."
[2:02:30] He said, "Because we were not welcomed.
[2:02:33] We were looked down upon."
[2:02:36] I want to ask you, where were you before
[2:02:38] you knew truth?
[2:02:40] Amen.
[2:02:42] Preach, brother.
[2:02:43] Right.
[2:02:44] Preach it. You longhaired
[2:02:48] dope smoking hippie.
[2:02:51] I'm talking to myself.
[2:02:53] Don't you judge a book by its cover.
[2:02:55] Amen.
[2:02:57] You should welcome them because
[2:03:00] but they're for the grace of God.
[2:03:04] [Music]
[2:03:05] You'd have been all tattooed up. You'd
[2:03:07] have had earrings. You'd have colored
[2:03:09] your hair. You'd have
[2:03:10] Huh? How dare we look it down on
[2:03:13] somebody because they got green hair.
[2:03:16] You know what? It just shows you need to
[2:03:18] pray for them.
[2:03:20] They're just showing you where they're
[2:03:21] at.
[2:03:22] Cuz where would you have been? You'd
[2:03:23] have been a radical.
[2:03:25] Yeah. You would have you'd have painted
[2:03:28] you'd have Hey, you know what? It was
[2:03:30] just a shock. Let's just shock somebody.
[2:03:36] God help us that we don't ever look
[2:03:38] down. And if somebody ever comes to one
[2:03:40] of our functions and they don't they're
[2:03:42] not dressed right,
[2:03:45] welcome them.
[2:03:48] And they shall know that you are my
[2:03:50] disciples
[2:03:53] because you all look alike
[2:03:59] because you have love one for another.
[2:04:02] Now you can love the sinner and hate the
[2:04:04] sin.
[2:04:05] Do you understand? There's a difference.
[2:04:07] Yeah,
[2:04:08] God help us.
[2:04:10] We don't ever look down. This is and I
[2:04:12] bear the shame because I thought some
[2:04:16] some of my kids didn't know any better
[2:04:19] and said some hurtful things to them.
[2:04:22] And chances are we'll never get them
[2:04:24] back to church.
[2:04:26] So let our lives be lived
[2:04:30] with
[2:04:33] a good spirit,
[2:04:36] not a condemning spirit. Although I will
[2:04:38] say that listen, the mere fact of you
[2:04:41] living the life of c of Christ and
[2:04:44] having his anointing upon you is going
[2:04:47] to make some people condemned.
[2:04:49] Amen.
[2:04:50] They're going to be convicted. They
[2:04:52] don't want to be around you.
[2:04:58] Blowing a trumpet always causes the
[2:05:01] people to gather together.
[2:05:05] Now, a trumpet sounds and it gets the
[2:05:07] people's attention.
[2:05:11] The mighty men of valor are gathered by
[2:05:13] the sound of a trumpet.
[2:05:15] And they are gathered prepare war.
[2:05:18] There's a call to arms.
[2:05:22] Battle stations. battle stations. This
[2:05:25] is not a drill.
[2:05:29] I hope that we are awake, not asleep.
[2:05:35] I read a book called At Dawn We Slept,
[2:05:38] the untold story of Pearl Harbor. How
[2:05:40] did it happen?
[2:05:45] How did how did they come and catch
[2:05:49] one of the mightiest powers
[2:05:52] and mightiest war machines asleep?
[2:05:58] How did these planes come in? How did
[2:06:01] they aform their attack?
[2:06:05] That it's one of the few books I read is
[2:06:07] a huge book and it's called the untold
[2:06:09] story of Pearl Harbor. At Dawn We Slept.
[2:06:13] and how that they came in and all of
[2:06:16] these planes, they came off of the
[2:06:18] aircraft carrier and they were under
[2:06:20] radio silence and they said, "Don't say
[2:06:23] anything. Don't radio to one another. We
[2:06:26] have a code word that when you have
[2:06:29] successfully bombed Pearl Harbor, I want
[2:06:32] you to say these words." What was it?
[2:06:36] Torah.
[2:06:38] Torah. Torah.
[2:06:43] At dawn we slept. Most of the guys they
[2:06:46] saw the the planes coming over and they
[2:06:48] said, "Ah." Ah, wow. Until they got down
[2:06:52] so low, they all of a sudden they see
[2:06:53] the
[2:06:55] the flag or the rising sun on the and
[2:06:58] they said they look and could see the
[2:07:00] smile on the enemy seeing as they flew
[2:07:02] over. They were so low
[2:07:05] and all of a sudden they're just bombing
[2:07:07] everything. And that's how we entered
[2:07:11] into the Second World War
[2:07:14] because at dawn we slept. Saints of God,
[2:07:17] may none of us
[2:07:19] be sleeping
[2:07:21] because we're under a spiritual attack.
[2:07:24] And I want all of you to understand that
[2:07:26] this spiritual attack in some way, in
[2:07:28] some form, is gonna is going to come
[2:07:30] after you, gonna come after your kids.
[2:07:33] And and which way is it gonna come? It
[2:07:35] may come through music. It may come
[2:07:37] through fashion. It may come through
[2:07:39] movies. It may But everything, all of
[2:07:41] this media
[2:07:43] is bombarding
[2:07:45] the minds.
[2:07:46] Amen.
[2:07:47] Of the people.
[2:07:49] Amen.
[2:07:51] Now,
[2:07:53] in 1962, Brother Bram said, "Sir, is
[2:07:56] this a sign of the end?" Watch this.
[2:07:58] John Wesley raised up in the days of the
[2:08:00] Anglican church when they said there's
[2:08:02] no more reason to have a revival. It
[2:08:05] went to seed. But John Wesley stood up
[2:08:08] with a message on the second work of
[2:08:11] great sanctification and he blessed that
[2:08:13] Anglican church with the gospel trumpet
[2:08:16] prepared for war.
[2:08:20] What was John Wesley doing?
[2:08:22] Calling to war.
[2:08:25] And the just
[2:08:27] shall live by faith. That was
[2:08:32] Martin Luther
[2:08:34] Wesley come along and you'll live a
[2:08:36] sanctified life.
[2:08:40] And they called it Methodist. You'll
[2:08:42] have a method.
[2:08:44] But what was he doing? What was his
[2:08:45] message doing? It's preparing them to go
[2:08:47] to war. It was a call to war. It was a
[2:08:49] declaration. So, brother Ram, paragraph
[2:08:53] 32, the sounding of the trumpet means a
[2:08:55] gospel trumpet.
[2:08:58] And the sounding of a trumpet in the
[2:08:59] Bible means get ready for scriptural
[2:09:02] war.
[2:09:04] 1 Corinthians 14:8
[2:09:07] Paul said, "If the trumpet gives an
[2:09:09] uncertain sound, how will a man know
[2:09:11] what to prepare for? And if it doesn't
[2:09:14] have a scriptural sound, a vindicated a
[2:09:17] vindication of the word made manifest,
[2:09:19] how we will know what how will we know
[2:09:24] we're at the end time?
[2:09:28] Do you know why all of you are here? And
[2:09:30] I trust that all of you have this
[2:09:32] revelation. You are here because you
[2:09:34] have heard the sounding of the seventh
[2:09:37] angels gospel trumpet.
[2:09:42] Amen. Amen.
[2:09:43] He's called you personally.
[2:09:45] That's right.
[2:09:50] It's gathering the mighty men of valor
[2:09:52] for this day.
[2:09:55] Was not calling foolish virgin though
[2:09:58] they woke up
[2:10:00] by the shout at the midnight hour.
[2:10:03] Even foolish virgin woke up.
[2:10:07] So go and listen to the sermons where
[2:10:09] brother Rem said the five wise, five
[2:10:13] foolish
[2:10:17] and you begin to understand. Now you
[2:10:19] cannot make somebody that's foolish wise
[2:10:24] though they be taught with the same
[2:10:25] thing that somebody who is wise because
[2:10:28] a wise man is likened unto he who
[2:10:30] heareth the word and straightway does
[2:10:32] it.
[2:10:34] That's what a wise man, a foolish man
[2:10:36] hears the same gospel and he goes
[2:10:40] straight away and guess what? He doesn't
[2:10:42] do it.
[2:10:44] So there are foolish virgin within this
[2:10:47] message that are going to suffer for
[2:10:49] their foolishness.
[2:10:52] It's going to happen during the time of
[2:10:54] the tribulation. Bride's going to go up.
[2:10:57] The two witnesses come down. Three and a
[2:10:59] half years of tribulation
[2:11:01] and that foolish virgin is going to be
[2:11:04] martyed.
[2:11:07] Wouldn't you rather give your life now?
[2:11:11] Lord, judge me now. Because you know
[2:11:13] what? This judgment that you go through
[2:11:15] right now is self judgment.
[2:11:17] So let a man judge himself,
[2:11:21] right? Let him eat of that cup and drink
[2:11:23] of that bread.
[2:11:25] Because when you judge yourself, you'll
[2:11:27] not be judged with the world.
[2:11:32] Amen. So now watch this here. Why I'm
[2:11:35] against organized religion? Do you know
[2:11:37] what the name of the sermon was
[2:11:40] up until Joseph Brandham took over and
[2:11:44] changed from Fred Sothman who had the
[2:11:47] tapes
[2:11:50] and took spoken word and incorporated
[2:11:54] the tapes and the books together and
[2:11:56] changed it to voice of God. So the
[2:11:59] sermon that you used to order from Fred
[2:12:02] Sauman was called the great harlot.
[2:12:06] I've got one of those original tapes.
[2:12:09] The original name is why
[2:12:13] I'm against organized religion. Wow.
[2:12:16] Amazing. Organized religion. Why am I
[2:12:20] against it? Listen to what he said.
[2:12:23] Jesus never said, "I commission you to
[2:12:25] go into all the world and make an
[2:12:26] organization." No, sir. No such a thing.
[2:12:28] To do this to is to reject
[2:12:32] uh the sacred scriptures. When this was
[2:12:35] done, it was changed from church by
[2:12:37] birth to a church by creed and dogma.
[2:12:41] Just what it's what they believe, not
[2:12:44] church, let me apologize, a lodge.
[2:12:46] You're born into the church, but you
[2:12:49] join a lodge. Then he talks about
[2:12:51] Methodist uh lodge and Baptist lodge and
[2:12:54] go on. You can't join church. There's no
[2:12:57] such a thing. You're born into it.
[2:12:58] Nicodemus
[2:13:00] was told that. That's why I'm against
[2:13:02] it. not against the people in it,
[2:13:07] but the system.
[2:13:09] Now, if you're not careful, you
[2:13:11] misunderstand even
[2:13:14] my preaching as a minister thinking that
[2:13:17] I'm against the people in the system.
[2:13:20] No. No, I'm not. It's the system of
[2:13:25] deception.
[2:13:26] Amen.
[2:13:29] They will believe a lie and be damned.
[2:13:33] That God will just receive any kind of
[2:13:36] sacrifice. That's why they don't preach
[2:13:38] against sin.
[2:13:42] You don't hear them preaching against
[2:13:43] sin.
[2:13:45] We're all going to heaven. It's a it it
[2:13:48] it's you know and if they do they don't
[2:13:52] mention the things that this prophet
[2:13:54] mentioned
[2:13:55] because this prophet brings us back.
[2:13:58] Now let me just give you an example in
[2:14:00] this musicians if you come I'm going to
[2:14:02] close here. I'm on page six and again I
[2:14:06] came to keep not finishing the sermons
[2:14:09] that I I type and I but that's okay.
[2:14:16] Nearly every sermon that Brother Brennan
[2:14:18] preaches,
[2:14:20] he hits on a woman cutting her hair.
[2:14:28] Huh? How many tape believers,
[2:14:30] tape listeners do we have out there?
[2:14:33] You ever heard him say it?
[2:14:35] He hits it in almost every sermon.
[2:14:38] He said, "What would cause a woman to
[2:14:40] cut her hair?"
[2:14:43] He said, "It's an ungodly
[2:14:46] sinful,
[2:14:48] seducing spirit
[2:14:51] causing her to dishonor her head, which
[2:14:53] is Christ.
[2:14:54] Amen.
[2:14:56] And he said, "A woman that cuts her
[2:14:58] hair, even trims it, is it okay to just
[2:15:01] trim the the split ends, the dead ends?
[2:15:04] I want my hair healthy. I'm just He
[2:15:07] said, "No, because if you cut it, you
[2:15:10] might as well shave it all off."
[2:15:16] So now he's showing brother for the Rem
[2:15:17] said now a woman that cuts her hair
[2:15:20] dishonors her head and her head which is
[2:15:21] Christ and he says that man has a right
[2:15:24] to put her away.
[2:15:26] Now, the Bible does not say that that is
[2:15:30] the reason why you can put her away, but
[2:15:33] he says it's a spirit because she'll
[2:15:36] dishonor her head, which is the word,
[2:15:40] and now she just takes any kind of
[2:15:41] headship, and she doesn't follow God's
[2:15:45] way.
[2:15:47] And so now she becomes a dishonorable
[2:15:49] woman. Now, I didn't say she he could go
[2:15:52] and marry another.
[2:15:54] said, "No, you just have a right to put
[2:15:56] her away."
[2:15:58] Now, Brother Brennham says, "I don't
[2:16:00] believe in divorce."
[2:16:05] Amen.
[2:16:06] In fact, I want to drill it into all of
[2:16:09] the minds of these young people.
[2:16:13] You know what? You're getting to the age
[2:16:14] where you're getting old enough now and
[2:16:16] you girls are looking at the boys and
[2:16:18] your boys are looking at the girls and
[2:16:20] you're thinking about ah maybe hey maybe
[2:16:22] when I get older I'll get married and
[2:16:24] this and that and there's nothing wrong
[2:16:26] with that. That's all of you are going
[2:16:27] to go through that.
[2:16:30] But when you choose,
[2:16:33] you better choose character over beauty.
[2:16:45] Yes.
[2:16:46] God hates divorce.
[2:16:50] In fact, brother Bram said, even as
[2:16:52] Moses said, because of the hardness of
[2:16:54] your heart,
[2:16:57] God help us. So, I want to tell our
[2:17:00] kids, don't you don't you even think
[2:17:03] about it.
[2:17:05] Huh? Don't you even get close to it.
[2:17:09] You wait. You pray. You seek God. Huh?
[2:17:13] Some some of you are so anxious to get
[2:17:15] married. If you're not careful, you'll
[2:17:16] get out here and you'll find a guy and
[2:17:18] he's nicel looking and next thing you
[2:17:20] know, hey, I remember
[2:17:24] my daughter one time come to me.
[2:17:28] She says, "Daddy, what about brother so
[2:17:31] and so in the church?" I said, "Don't
[2:17:32] think about it."
[2:17:35] And yet he was going to church. I said,
[2:17:36] "Don't you even think about it. I'll run
[2:17:39] him off.
[2:17:43] And then later you see what happens in
[2:17:45] lives and everything. And listen, God
[2:17:49] help us. Don't you want parents? Don't
[2:17:53] you want the right thing for your kids?
[2:17:56] Huh?
[2:17:59] You know what happens to the children of
[2:18:00] a divorce?
[2:18:05] They become innocent victims.
[2:18:11] I hate it.
[2:18:16] It's affected
[2:18:18] me. It's affected my family.
[2:18:25] I say, "Oh God,
[2:18:29] help me to preach the truth to my
[2:18:31] people.
[2:18:33] Let me preach to my family." Even
[2:18:36] saints, will you give me enough grace
[2:18:38] that I can say even for my own family?
[2:18:42] I don't cover it up. God doesn't cover
[2:18:44] up when his family did wrong also.
[2:18:47] And yet I love them.
[2:18:50] I love my family.
[2:18:52] I love my kids.
[2:18:54] I want them there.
[2:18:56] I'm doing everything that I
[2:18:58] possibly can.
[2:19:00] Keep them close, Lord.
[2:19:03] Let me not have a condemning heart.
[2:19:06] Let me have a loving heart.
[2:19:08] Let me love my grandchildren, my
[2:19:10] children, whatever, even when they go
[2:19:11] through hard times.
[2:19:14] Amen.
[2:19:19] Where will they come?
[2:19:23] Where will they come? Who will they come
[2:19:25] to seek help from?
[2:19:28] That's right.
[2:19:28] I hope they come to mom and dad.
[2:19:31] Amen. Because the people that you got,
[2:19:33] your friends, your buddies, your pals,
[2:19:35] Yeah. they're only fair weather friends.
[2:19:39] They're only there because of what you
[2:19:41] got or what you'll give.
[2:19:44] Yeah. What you'll give.
[2:19:48] And then when you ain't got drugs and
[2:19:50] you ain't got this and that and you've
[2:19:51] given yourself,
[2:19:55] you girls, listen to me. When you give
[2:19:58] of yourself to some guy, he'll drop you
[2:20:01] like a bad habit. You think he's wanting
[2:20:03] to marry you? Nah,
[2:20:06] he's using you.
[2:20:07] Amen.
[2:20:09] He's using you.
[2:20:14] God,
[2:20:16] help these parents in this church.
[2:20:19] Watch over your children.
[2:20:22] Amen.
[2:20:23] Amen.
[2:20:24] Preach to them. Yes.
[2:20:26] Tell him the truth. Back up your pastor.
[2:20:31] Amen.
[2:20:31] When he
[2:20:33] when he preaches correction,
[2:20:36] because as many as I love,
[2:20:40] I rebuke and I chasen. Be zealous,
[2:20:43] therefore, and repent.
[2:20:45] But I try to chasen with nail scarred
[2:20:47] hands.
[2:20:48] Amen.
[2:20:49] Not not through anger.
[2:20:53] Saints of God, this
[2:20:55] that I'm talking about. We rejoice over
[2:20:58] the open book. Take the book and eat it.
[2:21:02] Right? And when the true church gets a
[2:21:04] true revelation, hallelujah, she'll be
[2:21:06] an invincible army. Understand this army
[2:21:08] is going to war.
[2:21:10] Amen.
[2:21:12] It is spiritual warfare. Brother
[2:21:15] Brennham said, "Watch when this seventh
[2:21:18] angel when he begins to sound and he
[2:21:20] blasts forth his gospel trumpet." You
[2:21:23] know what? When you hear those tapes,
[2:21:25] you're hearing this prophet blow a
[2:21:27] gospel trumpet and it's calling the
[2:21:29] mighty men of valor. Come prepare war.
[2:21:33] It's a call to arms.
[2:21:35] [Music]
[2:21:36] And I'm going to show you. I I had it in
[2:21:38] my notes here that in the Old Testament
[2:21:42] when it says and you unchath the sword,
[2:21:46] it's a declaration of war.
[2:21:48] What happened on Sabino Canyon?
[2:21:55] He's up there praying. What? What? What
[2:21:57] does all this mean? Am I dying? Am I
[2:21:59] going off the scene? That's okay, God.
[2:22:01] He said, "A sword touched my hand." He
[2:22:03] said, "I thought they knight a man with
[2:22:06] a king's sword." He said, "This is not a
[2:22:08] king's sword. It's
[2:22:10] the king's sword." He said, "This is the
[2:22:15] third pull."
[2:22:19] The third pull.
[2:22:21] It's close quarters.
[2:22:24] This is not missiles, bazookas, rifles.
[2:22:30] It's close quarters.
[2:22:31] Amen.
[2:22:33] And you better know how to use the
[2:22:34] sword. We're talking the word of God.
[2:22:37] He said, "Because this sword that was
[2:22:39] placed in my hand, you all know what it
[2:22:41] is. It's the word of God."
[2:22:44] Amen.
[2:22:45] And when brother Brandham opened those
[2:22:47] seven seals,
[2:22:49] denominations totally rejected him. When
[2:22:52] he talks about angels, when he talks
[2:22:54] about the word being revealed and
[2:22:56] everything, and now doors are closing
[2:22:58] everywhere,
[2:22:59] and the only ones that were left open
[2:23:02] was just a few people here and there.
[2:23:07] Amen.
[2:23:08] Because you know what? The elect heard
[2:23:10] him gladly.
[2:23:12] Amen. God bless you all this morning.
[2:23:13] Listen,
[2:23:15] I want to take you into this that this
[2:23:17] sword that the was given to the prophet.
[2:23:21] He said, "That's why I'm against
[2:23:22] organized religion." He says, "You think
[2:23:25] it's okay to be baptized in father, son,
[2:23:27] holy ghost?"
[2:23:29] He said, "The devil travels in the name
[2:23:31] father, son, holy ghost.
[2:23:34] It's a lie."
[2:23:37] And he begins to now tell you spiritual
[2:23:40] truths. And for the first time, Satan is
[2:23:43] getting exposed.
[2:23:46] It's Babylonian.
[2:23:48] It's mystery Babylon.
[2:23:51] The mother having birthing
[2:23:55] harlots.
[2:23:56] And what part of that system? He said,
[2:23:59] is not the people.
[2:24:02] It's the system.
[2:24:04] Amen.
[2:24:04] It's a spirit.
[2:24:08] Amen.
[2:24:10] Okay.
[2:24:11] It's a spirit. It's why we're all
[2:24:12] fighting spirits. That's
[2:24:14] right.
[2:24:15] Did you know brother Bram said churches
[2:24:17] have spirits?
[2:24:19] I want this church to have the right
[2:24:21] kind of spirit.
[2:24:24] Amen. The spirit of Christ.
[2:24:27] Amen. That we know the truth and we know
[2:24:31] how to go to battle because you know
[2:24:32] what? Hey, listen. Every one of you,
[2:24:34] every one of you are going to have a
[2:24:36] battle. Every one of you are going to
[2:24:38] have to learn to fight.
[2:24:41] Yeah. Because you're called to war.
[2:24:43] This ain't no picnic.
[2:24:45] This is end time.
[2:24:47] This is ghoul line defense.
[2:24:53] Yeah.
[2:24:56] This is it. You ain't got no second
[2:24:58] chance.
[2:25:00] This is not playing monopoly.
[2:25:03] This is it. You better learn and you
[2:25:05] better learn well.
[2:25:06] Amen.
[2:25:09] Rise up among the Gentiles and declare
[2:25:11] unto them, prepare war.
[2:25:12] Amen.
[2:25:16] This whole message
[2:25:18] is preparing you to know how to fight a
[2:25:21] good fight.
[2:25:23] Amen.
[2:25:25] Are you saying, "Lord, teach me.
[2:25:29] Teach me war."
[2:25:33] Hallelujah. teach my hands for war.
[2:25:38] Let me fight and let me fight a good
[2:25:41] fight.
[2:25:41] Amen.
[2:25:43] Amen. Amen.
[2:25:51] Oh Lord,
[2:25:55] [Music]
[2:26:03] the battle rages.
[2:26:07] [Music]
[2:26:10] Prepare war.
[2:26:13] Get ready.
[2:26:16] Get ready because we're coming right now
[2:26:20] to the time of Armageddon.
[2:26:23] Bride's not going to see Armageddon.
[2:26:24] You're not going to fight Armageddon.
[2:26:26] No, no, no, no, no. You're called up.
[2:26:29] But the battle of Armageddon,
[2:26:32] okay, Brother Ram says, and I got the
[2:26:35] quotes on it. He says, now watch
[2:26:37] Armageddon. He says at the end of the
[2:26:39] tribulation
[2:26:42] three and a half years and then there's
[2:26:43] Armageddon.
[2:26:45] He said the bride is up in glory.
[2:26:49] Then there is a a but it doesn't destroy
[2:26:52] everything. It's a partial cleansing
[2:26:56] because there is a final and climactic
[2:27:00] battle which ends all things. The mother
[2:27:02] of all battles
[2:27:05] and that is the battle of Gog and Magog.
[2:27:07] Amen.
[2:27:08] The brother Bram said watch the one
[2:27:10] battle is before Armageddon.
[2:27:13] Okay. Or be excuse me I said before
[2:27:18] millennium
[2:27:20] and one is after the millennium
[2:27:22] because the devil is bound for thousand
[2:27:25] years by chain of circumstance but then
[2:27:28] he's loose for a period of time. How
[2:27:30] many knows that?
[2:27:34] So we're going to look at this. We're
[2:27:35] going to look at these things so that
[2:27:37] you'll understand that we are called to
[2:27:40] war.
[2:27:41] [Music]
[2:27:44] And you you've got to learn to fight.
[2:27:50] Amen. God bless you. Let's stand
[2:27:52] together.
[2:27:56] Brother Robert, go ahead and lead us.
[2:27:58] Even so, even so, let's sing this before
[2:28:00] we dismiss.
