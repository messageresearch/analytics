[44:24] [Music]
[44:26] there
[44:29] [Music]
[44:31] so appreciate you coming
[44:36] by Opening Our
[44:40] Eyes giving us
[44:44] courage covering us with your
[44:50] blood and then taking and placing us in
[44:54] a
[44:55] position where we can can have the same
[44:58] Authority that you
[45:01] had when Adam lost the book he lost
[45:04] three things your Prophet told us he
[45:07] lost the right
[45:08] relationship eternal life and dominion
[45:11] over the
[45:13] Earth and now when the book was back in
[45:15] our hands we found out we're back in the
[45:17] right
[45:18] relationship prise the Lord and not only
[45:21] [Music]
[45:22] that we're eating from the Tree of Life
[45:25] am and not only that
[45:27] now the bride is the final
[45:30] voice so here we
[45:32] are asking for favor again that you'll
[45:35] take your word like you did last night
[45:38] polish those stones so we can see our
[45:41] reflection yes and say that's
[45:44] me in your name we ask these things amen
[45:48] amen amen God bless you this morning God
[45:50] richly bless you Revelations chapter
[45:53] 8 this morning God bless you want to say
[45:56] hi to so many friends my goodness all
[45:58] the way from Quebec down to Phoenix and
[46:02] everywhere else I just feel like coming
[46:04] home to family over here so good to be
[46:07] here again and uh I sure appreciate uh
[46:11] the polishing of the stones last night
[46:13] and I could see my reflection in it and
[46:16] I thought Lord what are you doing after
[46:18] actually halfway when he's through his
[46:19] service I said boy the Lord I Hope You
[46:21] derail that boy pretty soon here now cuz
[46:24] he's reading in my territory right about
[46:26] now
[46:28] so God heard my prayer and derailed him
[46:32] so I want to say it's always a blessing
[46:35] for me to come to be here with brother
[46:37] Ron you know brother Ron sister Sandy
[46:40] you know they're a special spot in my
[46:41] heart and they've been a beacon of
[46:43] stability all my life you
[46:45] know and I really like it when brother
[46:47] Ron and sister Sandy come pick us up
[46:49] from the hotel and we come to separate
[46:52] vehicles and Ron comes with the truck
[46:54] and she comes with a car and then she
[46:57] says Ron did you clean your
[46:59] truck and I'm thinking boy I like that
[47:03] that sounds like home to
[47:05] me and she's making sure his truck is
[47:08] clean and then we get in the truck she
[47:09] said not
[47:14] bad I'll tell you what it's just good to
[47:16] have her feet on the ground amen I'll
[47:19] tell you something else about your
[47:20] pastor why I really respect
[47:23] him and that is because years ago he was
[47:27] in a situation in a church in
[47:28] Saskatchewan where God had led him for a
[47:31] while and remember there's no mistakes
[47:32] in God they feel like mistakes right but
[47:35] at the end of the day you got to either
[47:36] believe the footsteps of the Lord are
[47:38] ordered or they're not that's right I
[47:40] mean your bad steps were ordered just
[47:42] like your good steps who ordered but you
[47:43] don't want to believe that but God
[47:45] ordered your bad steps what look like
[47:46] bad steps
[47:48] also so brother Ron he was a pastoring
[47:51] in in scat one there and then the spirit
[47:53] of the Lord started working and bringing
[47:55] the people to a higher level and the
[47:57] reason I really respect brother Ron and
[47:59] his Integrity is that brother Ron knew
[48:02] that if he'd stay there too long that
[48:04] the church would
[48:06] split and he has Integrity he knows what
[48:09] type it would put him
[48:11] in before the foundations of the world
[48:14] to have that kind of a track record
[48:16] behind them so instead of hurting the
[48:19] church brotherr on
[48:21] left I'll tell you something that's why
[48:24] David went to the Wilderness yeah
[48:27] because if he'd have stayed under that
[48:28] bad pastor's Church he'd split that
[48:31] church also but David knew what type he
[48:33] would fulfill and David said I'm not
[48:36] fulfilling that type I'm leaving then
[48:39] David headed off to the
[48:44] Wilderness does that make sense to
[48:47] you you know that's what absum couldn't
[48:49] do absum right in his ambition didn't
[48:54] realize the type he was fulfilling yeah
[48:56] and he was under a good pastor
[49:01] amen so the seventh seal is more than
[49:04] just ink on paper amen it's encrypted
[49:09] communication if you understand that let
[49:13] me say
[49:14] this if you're depending on quotes to
[49:17] get you to heaven then Peter would have
[49:19] baptized
[49:21] wrong true yeah yeah that's right come
[49:25] on that's right amen Jesus said be
[49:27] baptized in the name of Father Son and
[49:28] Holy Ghost that was a
[49:33] quote but he had the revelation of that
[49:36] courot hallelujah hallelujah GL he had
[49:41] the unspoken
[49:43] part of that
[49:45] quote yes amen so you
[49:49] know I think we're in a tremendous spot
[49:52] amen that's why brother Bram said in the
[49:54] seven seal paragraph 300 oh stop right
[50:00] here don't go any further that's right
[50:03] so that's right I have a lot of respect
[50:06] for brother Ron because it's not just
[50:08] about a man behind a Pulpit yeah
[50:11] speaking words that's not it's the
[50:12] mystery in his
[50:16] life brother Brandon says that it's not
[50:19] what you do on Earth it's the type that
[50:21] you'll
[50:24] fulfill your type will condemn you not
[50:28] what you
[50:29] do so every action on Earth has a
[50:32] fulfillment of a type already
[50:34] pre-written in the in the heavens does
[50:36] that make all make sense you understand
[50:39] see that's why sometimes when God
[50:41] expects you to do something in the flesh
[50:42] you don't have the
[50:44] strength but when you see your type in
[50:46] the scriptures that gives you strength
[50:49] to do what your flesh can't do right cuz
[50:52] your type will carry you through when
[50:54] your flesh won't does that make
[50:59] sallah so I appreciate the specials
[51:01] today very very very much such wonderful
[51:06] people you're so precious you're so
[51:09] yesterday I was talking to some people
[51:10] and I saw those beautiful little girls
[51:12] and I thought man how precious in God's
[51:15] sight is to have those children in that
[51:18] age of
[51:19] innocence and to keep them innocent all
[51:22] the way till the meet of Christ let's
[51:24] borrow let's let's read our Bibles
[51:26] Revelations chapter 8 when he had opened
[51:29] the seventh seal there was silence in
[51:31] heaven about the space of a half
[51:36] hour and he saw the seven angels which
[51:39] stood before God and to them was given
[51:40] seven
[51:41] trumpets and a I love the scriptures and
[51:44] another angel came which makes it the
[51:46] eighth Angel amen you were those Jewish
[51:50] boys were circumcised on the eighth day
[51:53] that's right amen Christ Rose in the
[51:56] moral after the Sabbath on the eth day
[51:59] turn with me to Hebrews if you would
[52:01] chapter
[52:05] 2
[52:07] um I think that's where I'm
[52:16] at but we see Jesus chapter 2:9 but we
[52:20] see Jesus who is made a little lower
[52:22] than the
[52:23] angels for the suffering of death
[52:27] crowned with Glory and Honor that he by
[52:31] the grace of God should taste death for
[52:34] every man and here's really where I want
[52:35] to get to for it became him for whom are
[52:41] all things amen by whom are
[52:47] all
[52:48] things to bring many sons to
[52:52] glory to make the captain
[52:57] of
[52:59] their boy can preach now huh to make the
[53:05] captain of
[53:07] their salvation perfect through
[53:12] suffering okay let me just back up a
[53:14] little
[53:16] bit to bring many sons to glory to make
[53:19] the captain of their salvation you're
[53:23] being perfected as you redeem your
[53:25] children
[53:31] amen you are being perfected as you pay
[53:35] the price of redemption for your
[53:44] children verse 11 for both he that
[53:48] sanctifieth and they that are Sanctified
[53:51] are all of One amen for both he that
[53:56] that
[53:57] sanctifieth and they that are Sanctified
[54:00] are all one for which cause he is not
[54:05] ashamed to call you
[54:08] brother
[54:10] Hallelujah Heavenly
[54:12] Father such an amazing atmosphere we
[54:15] thank you for your grace in your name we
[54:17] ask amen God bless you this morning God
[54:21] richly richly bless you this
[54:25] morning
[54:28] I'd like to take a thought oh you know
[54:30] my clicker back
[54:32] there that clicker that they gave me
[54:34] there is back there I've been on a
[54:37] thought this the last while that I can't
[54:39] seem to get away from I thought I'd
[54:41] preach a couple of services and and now
[54:43] it's been two months later or something
[54:45] like
[54:46] that and the thought the the uh click
[54:51] click and the thought that I can't get
[54:54] away from is the way of a true pastor
[54:58] amen and
[55:01] um brother Brandon preached a message
[55:03] called the way of a true
[55:07] prophet and I thought to myself okay I
[55:10] get
[55:11] it there's another message that needs to
[55:13] be preached that's called the way of a
[55:16] true Pastor because I believe this is
[55:20] Brother Eugene Brown speaking now just
[55:22] and if I say some things from my heart
[55:24] that are off balance just forgive me
[55:26] but I believe most people this day n to
[55:29] don't recognize a pastor if they saw
[55:33] one we've been so sensitized to a
[55:37] prophetic
[55:39] message that we've missed that not we
[55:43] have not all of us but that it's easy to
[55:45] miss a pastoral message because we've
[55:50] been so well profit trained true does
[55:54] that make sense to you
[55:57] and what happens is
[56:01] that because of that we miss a whole
[56:06] portion now boy I don't
[56:10] know there's parents they're trying to
[56:13] be prophets to their children but they
[56:15] won't be pastors to their
[56:18] children
[56:24] amen because we've been so
[56:27] Pulpit taught on the prophetic that the
[56:31] parents can't get down and P their own
[56:40] children and
[56:43] preachers are not pastoring there's lots
[56:46] of preachers that are not pastoring all
[56:48] they're doing is preaching sermons
[56:50] that's right that's
[56:52] right and in this day and ages
[56:59] the idolatry isn't necessarily in the
[57:01] Pulpit the idolatry is in the people
[57:03] that they don't discern the spirit of
[57:05] The Man Behind the pulpit amen that's
[57:07] right because
[57:10] idolatry in its purest form is spiritual
[57:13] laziness to discern
[57:19] Spirits brother Ron's right I'm not like
[57:22] brother Brian I've just got a single
[57:25] shot
[57:33] brother Brian he
[57:46] comes but we're
[57:49] idolatry the essence of idolatry is the
[57:53] heart to discern Spirits is such heart
[57:56] work most people don't go to the pain of
[57:59] discerning Spirits they take the easy
[58:02] Road just to believe something somebody
[58:06] says and not discern the spirit
[58:09] behind what somebody
[58:16] says
[58:18] Eve was confronted to do not with what
[58:22] the serpent
[58:25] said but
[58:27] with the spirit
[58:30] behind why the serpent said what he said
[58:34] yeah idolatry at the height of idolatry
[58:41] is the spiritual laziness to discern
[58:44] Spirits
[58:47] yeah so when boy Han like getting very
[58:52] far so
[58:54] when by the time Eve Bo you know it's so
[58:58] frustrating to
[59:02] me we
[59:04] so some people are so bent on making
[59:08] sure you say exactly everything the way
[59:10] the prophet said it that the minute you
[59:13] say something to pull up a laptop and
[59:15] run a quote to see if you missed an i or
[59:17] them or not or something or other you
[59:20] know what I'm trying to
[59:23] say but by the time the ser got Eve
[59:27] there where she wouldn't catch what was
[59:29] added she was already
[59:32] deceived
[59:37] true does that make
[59:39] sense because she was deceived she never
[59:42] caught the
[59:45] knot because what happened was the
[59:47] serpent changed her relationship
[59:51] first and once the relationship was
[59:54] changed she couldn't catch the kn
[1:00:00] not because what happened was to the
[1:00:06] serpent if you I don't well I didn't
[1:00:08] want it this is not my topic at all but
[1:00:11] to the
[1:00:12] serpent the serpent had a god
[1:00:16] relationship just like you can make your
[1:00:18] car your God or your church your God or
[1:00:21] this building your God or brother God or
[1:00:23] whatever the serpent only has a God
[1:00:26] relationship an object of worship
[1:00:28] relationship but he doesn't have an
[1:00:30] Elohim relationship he cannot have an
[1:00:33] Elohim relationship because in the eloh
[1:00:36] you have to be part of the family and he
[1:00:38] never will be part of the
[1:00:40] family does this make sense to you you
[1:00:42] can make this church your God and Miss
[1:00:45] Christ 1,000 miles and you can make your
[1:00:48] car your God miss a th000 miles but the
[1:00:50] point I'm making is that the serpent
[1:00:52] only had a god relationship as an object
[1:00:55] of worship
[1:00:56] but but when he reveals himself watch
[1:00:59] chapter 2 the Lord God said and the Lord
[1:01:01] God said and then when the serpent came
[1:01:03] to Eve said hath not God said and she
[1:01:05] missed it then she believed not that's
[1:01:10] right because idolatry at the highest
[1:01:14] level
[1:01:16] is spiritual laziness to discern the
[1:01:20] spirit behind what's
[1:01:23] being presented
[1:01:27] do you know you can tell the truth and
[1:01:28] not be
[1:01:35] honest you can tell the truth and not be
[1:01:40] honest you can tell the truth and
[1:01:42] mislead people with the truth but you
[1:01:44] can't be honest in telling the truth and
[1:01:46] mislead people that you can't
[1:01:50] do we're coming to an age
[1:01:54] where let let's say I'm a good
[1:01:57] orator let's say I'm a good
[1:02:00] lecturer let's say I'm a good debator
[1:02:02] let's say I'm the kind of guy that can
[1:02:04] prove my point all right that's my gift
[1:02:07] I can prove my point
[1:02:09] right I can now with the
[1:02:12] message you can be a paste and cut cut
[1:02:16] and paste preacher line it up prove your
[1:02:19] point and a lot of people will not
[1:02:22] recognize the difference between that
[1:02:24] man and a pastor true right
[1:02:29] you know I was in South Africa a while
[1:02:31] ago and the guys are telling me about
[1:02:32] this chat gbt is did I say that right
[1:02:35] you guys is that right chat gbt is that
[1:02:38] what it is you can take a thought throw
[1:02:41] in a computer program and tell the
[1:02:43] thought exactly how tell the computer
[1:02:45] how to present the thing piit you at a
[1:02:47] spit you at a three-page essay and
[1:02:50] presented in complete professionalism
[1:02:52] and it's AI
[1:02:54] generated true do you know what I mean
[1:02:57] but but if that's the natural we've got
[1:03:00] preachers doing that in the spiritual as
[1:03:02] well computer generated
[1:03:05] thoughts but they themselves are not
[1:03:24] called
[1:03:28] but you know you say that's bad no
[1:03:30] that's
[1:03:32] [Music]
[1:03:34] good what do you mean that's
[1:03:37] good because the Bible says in God's
[1:03:40] host are vessels of honor and dishonor
[1:03:43] that's right and God doesn't take away
[1:03:45] the vessels of Dishonor to make it
[1:03:47] easier for you does he now I need a big
[1:03:51] amen he needs you to have the ability to
[1:03:55] discern God's house in the honor and the
[1:04:00] dishonor cuz in God's house there
[1:04:03] vessels of honor and dishonor now listen
[1:04:05] let me just say this this is not about
[1:04:07] people going to hell because they do
[1:04:08] stuff wrong all I'm saying is that David
[1:04:11] needed a
[1:04:15] Saul Saul did David
[1:04:19] good cuz Saul taught David things about
[1:04:22] himself that God needed Saul to teach
[1:04:25] David Avid about himself and without
[1:04:28] taking Saul out David wouldn't be near
[1:04:31] the character he was today so what I'm
[1:04:33] saying is in God's house are vessels of
[1:04:35] honor and dishonor and you need the
[1:04:39] vessels of Dishonor for your discernment
[1:04:52] Perfection the way of a true pastor
[1:05:01] let me just
[1:05:08] recap we've been so profit
[1:05:12] trained that sometimes if a minister
[1:05:15] comes behind this
[1:05:16] pulpit and if he starts really pastoring
[1:05:20] you guys think he lost his anointing
[1:05:23] true because we've been so p ized or so
[1:05:36] prophetie lived
[1:05:39] out on this
[1:05:43] Earth Ephesians
[1:05:46] 4 God has given you pastors
[1:05:51] teachers prophets Apostles so you can
[1:05:54] take your
[1:05:56] faith and get it to look right on the
[1:05:59] ground until we all come in the unity of
[1:06:02] Faith does that make
[1:06:04] sense now you dare do without a fivefold
[1:06:08] Ministry because the fivefold ministry
[1:06:10] is there to help you get your faith
[1:06:13] reflected in your
[1:06:17] Works am I making
[1:06:24] sense so
[1:06:30] so I find this topic fascinating
[1:06:36] because we're actually all Shepherds
[1:06:40] true the chief Shepherd is Jesus Christ
[1:06:43] I don't want to go through a lot of
[1:06:44] scriptures because I'm I've got a single
[1:06:46] shot right so I don't have all the time
[1:06:47] to to go Blaze through this stuff
[1:06:50] right the chief Shepherd is Jesus Christ
[1:06:54] so if you want to know if you're lining
[1:06:55] up to be a pastor your Chief Pastor is
[1:06:58] Jesus Christ your second Pastor is the
[1:07:01] pastor to the age as the seventh Church
[1:07:04] age messenger your next Pastor is
[1:07:06] brother Ron and myself to the church
[1:07:08] your next Pastor the father to the
[1:07:10] family and your next Pastor the mother
[1:07:12] to the children and all of us have to
[1:07:15] line up under that one straight rule
[1:07:18] your example is not me or brother Ron
[1:07:20] it's your Chief Pastor is your example
[1:07:25] okay does does that make sense so the
[1:07:27] point I'm making is that that all of us
[1:07:31] are the basic word for Shepherds and
[1:07:35] parenting actually in the Hebrew is
[1:07:36] actually a feeder somebody that teaches
[1:07:39] that's your first priori is to feed and
[1:07:42] to teach amen and you find out that the
[1:07:46] Lord is my
[1:07:49] shepherd and so the grass is not greener
[1:07:51] on the other side that's right right if
[1:07:55] you've ever been under the chief
[1:07:59] Shepherd you're at rest you're not a
[1:08:01] fence jumper cuz I shall not want listen
[1:08:06] there's more of this word available for
[1:08:08] you than you can
[1:08:14] swallow way
[1:08:19] more brother Brian yesterday when he was
[1:08:22] preaching I thought man some I wanted to
[1:08:26] preach a message on the seven Thunder
[1:08:28] voices between the feet and the
[1:08:30] side then when he went into interval I
[1:08:32] thought shut
[1:08:46] up
[1:08:48] because there's an opportunity that has
[1:08:51] to be recognized
[1:08:54] sir you know you know what I mean
[1:08:56] l cuz that season is going to close
[1:08:59] there's a certain season that opens and
[1:09:02] that season is going to close and in
[1:09:04] that season you better recognize what
[1:09:06] the requirement is in that
[1:09:09] season because the door is going to
[1:09:11] close one
[1:09:12] day cuz it's open in that
[1:09:18] season and so the spiritual health of
[1:09:21] the children our reflection of the
[1:09:23] shepherding and that goes all the way
[1:09:25] down
[1:09:25] because we're actually a a nurturer of
[1:09:28] the rotation of fresh grass let me tell
[1:09:30] you a little bit about Psalms 23 in
[1:09:33] Psalms 23 there's four levels of grass
[1:09:35] Still Waters Green Pastures table lands
[1:09:38] in the presence of your enemy The
[1:09:40] Shepherd takes his sheep through all he
[1:09:43] keeps his sheep on the move through four
[1:09:45] levels of grass glass grass lion ox man
[1:09:50] eagle and the shepherd's job is to keep
[1:09:52] you moving through the revelation of the
[1:09:55] word
[1:09:56] because in every Pastor is different
[1:09:58] nutrition that you need to keep you
[1:10:02] moving and you take a sheep if you leave
[1:10:04] a sheep by himself and don't move a
[1:10:08] sheep he'll graze that grass and regra
[1:10:11] that grass and he'll dung his own grass
[1:10:14] and he'll kill his own Roots he'll
[1:10:16] literally kill his own grass cuz Sheep
[1:10:18] by nature don't want to move so the
[1:10:21] shepherd pushes you from Revelation to
[1:10:24] revelation to the seals to the breach to
[1:10:28] the interval to the Millennium to
[1:10:30] Revelations 19 go back to Genesis 3 go
[1:10:33] up to the point is there's nutrition at
[1:10:36] every level of grass because it's the
[1:10:38] she the Sheep's worst enemies to leave
[1:10:41] him
[1:10:44] alone
[1:10:48] right but you'll find out that God
[1:10:51] actually loves your children more than
[1:10:52] the
[1:10:54] parents
[1:10:57] and you'll find out that God also loves
[1:10:59] the church more than the
[1:11:03] pastor and you'll find out that God
[1:11:05] loves this bride age more than brother
[1:11:11] brandom turn with
[1:11:13] me oh yeah just let's go uh Ezekiel 34
[1:11:18] should
[1:11:24] be
[1:11:33] the word of the Lord came to be saying
[1:11:35] son of man prophesy against the
[1:11:36] Shepherds of Israel prophesy and say
[1:11:38] unto them thus sayi the Lord God unto
[1:11:40] the
[1:11:41] Shepherds woe to the Shepherds of Israel
[1:11:45] that do feed
[1:11:47] themselves should not the Shepherds feed
[1:11:51] the
[1:11:54] flock it's
[1:12:01] true you eat the
[1:12:03] fat you clothe you with the wool from
[1:12:06] the sheep that is you kill them that are
[1:12:09] fed you feed not the flock the disease
[1:12:12] you have not
[1:12:15] strengthened neither have you healed
[1:12:17] that to a sick neither have you bound up
[1:12:19] that which was broken neither have you
[1:12:21] brought again that was driven away
[1:12:23] neither have you thought that was lost
[1:12:25] but with force and with Pulpit
[1:12:31] cruelty you reigned
[1:12:38] [Music]
[1:12:41] them you
[1:12:45] know if I'm a pastor right I'm a father
[1:12:48] Pastor grandfather and a horse
[1:12:54] trainer one time I was in a show
[1:12:58] ring and the horse that this girl had in
[1:13:01] the ring you know they were having a
[1:13:04] internal argument and the horse just
[1:13:06] royally blew up right in the sh ring
[1:13:08] right she came out of the
[1:13:11] ring and it was so good she came in the
[1:13:14] ring storming mad and she said this
[1:13:17] stupid
[1:13:18] horse and an old trainer just walked by
[1:13:21] and he said horse reflects the
[1:13:24] trainer
[1:13:32] do you know that the authority figure is
[1:13:34] responsible for the relationship to the
[1:13:36] subjective figure did you know
[1:13:40] that do you know that the minute a
[1:13:44] husband throws his wife under the bus
[1:13:45] he's lost his
[1:13:47] position cuz he's her Redeemer
[1:13:52] yes the minute brother Ron blames this
[1:13:55] church for his hardships he's lost his
[1:14:07] position do you know the you say yeah
[1:14:11] but my wife did this or my husband or my
[1:14:13] church or
[1:14:14] whatever do you know
[1:14:16] that when you're not getting the results
[1:14:19] that you want you've only got one option
[1:14:21] you know what that is Dad's to the
[1:14:26] family pastors to the church brother
[1:14:29] brandom to the age Jesus Christ to the
[1:14:31] world when you're not getting the
[1:14:33] results that you think you should
[1:14:35] deserve you know if you don't want to
[1:14:37] lose your position you only got one
[1:14:39] option you know what that is make a
[1:14:41] greater
[1:14:49] sacrifice you know before the Old
[1:14:51] Testament God would say Moses I'm so
[1:14:55] sick and tired of them hard stiff necked
[1:14:58] people step aside Moses I'm going to
[1:15:00] kill every one of
[1:15:01] them that was before Calvary do you know
[1:15:05] after Calvary you'll never ever find
[1:15:07] Christ again blame the church because
[1:15:10] Christ himself if the church isn't
[1:15:13] responding the way that the church
[1:15:16] should respond he sends him another
[1:15:18] church Aid messenger with more word
[1:15:20] another church Aid messenger more word
[1:15:22] another church a messenger more word
[1:15:24] after Calvary Dad if you're not getting
[1:15:26] the results you want from your wife or
[1:15:28] your kids you got one option you got to
[1:15:31] get yourself dedicated to the Lord
[1:15:35] first cuz the minute the authority
[1:15:37] figure blames the subjective figure
[1:15:40] you've lost your respect in your
[1:15:41] position as a
[1:15:44] leader when I see stuff in my church I
[1:15:47] don't like I'm looking in the
[1:15:53] mirror d Russian da but if my church
[1:15:58] does good and I'm proud of them I'm
[1:15:59] looking through a window and give them
[1:16:02] credit but if I'm not getting the
[1:16:04] results I want what's it did the horse
[1:16:07] is only as good as the
[1:16:18] trainer God loves your children more
[1:16:20] than
[1:16:23] you those children became
[1:16:26] innocent they came loving Mom and Dad no
[1:16:30] matter how bad mom and dad
[1:16:33] are they came with unlimited
[1:16:36] forgiveness the kids got a 10 m the mom
[1:16:38] and dad got a 10 mile Head Start in the
[1:16:48] relationship you know God loves you more
[1:16:50] than brother
[1:16:53] Ron you know God loves the bride more
[1:16:56] than brother brandham that's why he held
[1:16:58] them on such a tight
[1:17:00] leash do you know what a a a chain shank
[1:17:04] is on a horse he
[1:17:09] does what's supposed to happen is
[1:17:13] this you're my
[1:17:17] horse this is what's supposed to happen
[1:17:20] okay if if this is my
[1:17:23] horse and if he's got the seven
[1:17:27] seal relationship to me he just wants to
[1:17:31] know one thing what do I
[1:17:34] want that's it I don't need a lead shank
[1:17:39] between me
[1:17:41] to you stupid
[1:17:48] horse but if he's got my mind if I move
[1:17:52] what does he
[1:17:53] do
[1:18:06] he's getting
[1:18:19] yet that's the seventh
[1:18:23] seal but you know if the horse isn't
[1:18:26] responding and is one of those horses
[1:18:28] that can't get the attention what you do
[1:18:31] and if he's not listening cuz that horse
[1:18:33] is useless if he's not thinking about me
[1:18:35] I don't care if a a if a rabbit runs
[1:18:37] across the road or if a cow's over there
[1:18:39] if there's a tornado there if his mind
[1:18:42] if I'm going like this and his mind is
[1:18:43] over there boy and if I can't catch his
[1:18:46] attention to where he's thinking about
[1:18:47] me first I got to do something because
[1:18:50] we're headed for a Rapture and you
[1:18:52] better be in tune with your Jesus Christ
[1:18:54] cuz when he I'm going with him what I'm
[1:18:56] trying to say is I'm not waiting for him
[1:18:58] to come I'm waiting for him to leave and
[1:19:00] when he leaves I want to know he's
[1:19:03] leaving cuz he's
[1:19:06] [Applause]
[1:19:11] here but if he's not listening then you
[1:19:13] can take a a chain shank with in instead
[1:19:16] of the Lee shank on his halter there's a
[1:19:18] chain portion of the leite shank you put
[1:19:20] it under his chin and hook it on this
[1:19:22] side and then if I pull and he's not
[1:19:24] yanking I'll yank yank that thing and
[1:19:25] boy he'll back up and there'll be some
[1:19:27] blood and there'll be some hurt and
[1:19:28] he'll do like this but guess what we got
[1:19:30] his
[1:19:37] attention but what's supposed to be the
[1:19:39] end result of the chain shank when I
[1:19:42] move
[1:19:44] move you know what I mean like the
[1:19:47] attention is not for pain the attention
[1:19:49] is to teach us
[1:19:52] something come on very good
[1:19:58] and
[1:20:01] so the minute a trainer blames the horse
[1:20:04] the trainer's just exposed himself the
[1:20:06] minute a dad blames the wife he's just
[1:20:08] exposed himself the minute the the
[1:20:10] parents blame the children they've just
[1:20:12] exposed them themselves the minute the
[1:20:14] pastor blames the church he just exposed
[1:20:19] himself because these are laws of
[1:20:21] redemption yeah yeah
[1:20:25] a prophet has a prophetic
[1:20:29] view remember Paul was a prophet but
[1:20:32] James was a
[1:20:34] pastor right James is the first
[1:20:37] Pastor you know that's what Paul
[1:20:40] saw but what James saws your Works
[1:20:43] proves your faith Paul said your faith
[1:20:46] proves your Works James says your Works
[1:20:48] proves your faith looking at the same
[1:20:50] thing from Pastor angle and from
[1:20:52] prophetic
[1:20:53] angle
[1:20:57] because what you believe should end up
[1:20:59] feet on the
[1:21:03] ground and the pastor is concerned that
[1:21:06] what looks like feet on the ground
[1:21:08] matches what you
[1:21:09] believe amen if that makes sense the way
[1:21:13] of a true
[1:21:16] Pastor a prophetic view is the world
[1:21:19] view the big View and I thank God for
[1:21:21] that that's not that is wrong but the
[1:21:23] other side of pastor's view is teaching
[1:21:25] those principles so that it looks like
[1:21:27] it on the ground that's the pastor side
[1:21:30] of the
[1:21:31] Prophet you know somebody told me the
[1:21:34] story I thought was tremendous he said
[1:21:36] they asked brother brandom about
[1:21:38] preachers and all kinds of preachers and
[1:21:40] stuff and brother BR says hold up your
[1:21:44] hand and he says look at this he
[1:21:48] says
[1:21:52] take this is your pastor he's the Lord
[1:21:54] on the totem
[1:21:56] pole see
[1:21:57] that he's the ox the most
[1:22:01] unnoticed then you have Apostle
[1:22:05] evangelist Prophet apost uh teacher and
[1:22:09] the rest of
[1:22:10] it but he told him you know what you
[1:22:12] want to know what the purpose of a
[1:22:14] pastor is he said try to pick up
[1:22:16] something with the Evangelist and the
[1:22:23] apostle come on then he said try to pick
[1:22:28] up something with the Evangelist and the
[1:22:41] teacher he said every evangelist needs a
[1:22:46] pastor every Apostle needs a home
[1:22:49] church every preacher Apostle needs a
[1:22:53] pastor take care of his family
[1:22:55] every man that thinks he's a prophet
[1:22:57] needs a pastor cuz with the pastor you
[1:22:59] can pick up
[1:23:03] anything and
[1:23:06] yet we've got computer generated
[1:23:14] preachers it's good for a while but no
[1:23:18] grip and I'm just saying that I don't I
[1:23:21] I got no Personal Agenda but what I'm
[1:23:24] saying is we've got such AI technology
[1:23:26] that I wonder if the people would ever
[1:23:28] discern a real
[1:23:30] Pastor is what I'm
[1:23:33] saying or is it a la a good
[1:23:39] lecturer does that make sense to you now
[1:23:42] see CU I know the natural typees the
[1:23:45] spiritual now apparently you can go to
[1:23:48] uh some kind of an app and tell that app
[1:23:51] Listen draw me a picture of brother
[1:23:53] Brandon standing side ice Dwight
[1:23:55] Eisenhower you know under a tree
[1:23:58] discussing the Seven Seals and that
[1:23:59] Apple draw a picture and you would be
[1:24:01] hard find if that wasn't
[1:24:06] real I say what separates these things
[1:24:09] I'll tell you what it is it's the
[1:24:10] seventh seal yeah amen it's what's not
[1:24:15] spoken amen somebody told me the other
[1:24:17] day he said don't you Jean don't you
[1:24:19] just love what's spoken I said yeah but
[1:24:21] I've been listening to what's not
[1:24:23] spoken
[1:24:27] because you
[1:24:29] see when the angel came to
[1:24:33] eler elzer is looking for a wife and the
[1:24:36] angel came to elzer and then the angel
[1:24:39] made elizer promise to listen the woman
[1:24:40] that takes and gives me water and the
[1:24:43] camels water that's the
[1:24:50] girl when eleazer meets Rebecca
[1:24:55] elaser says by the way would you give me
[1:24:59] some water and she says sure I'll not
[1:25:03] only give you water but I'll also give
[1:25:05] the camels water it wasn't
[1:25:09] spoken she caught the
[1:25:12] mind of the angel that had visited in
[1:25:16] the unspoken
[1:25:19] promise and there was no quote for
[1:25:22] that that's right
[1:25:35] so I like this now my subject this
[1:25:39] morning I trust God this is uh the
[1:25:41] unveiling of Christ the second paragraph
[1:25:44] after he read the scriptures he says I
[1:25:47] trust that God will reveal
[1:25:53] this each time if you take the tapes and
[1:25:56] listen and I hope and trusting that that
[1:25:59] you have had a spiritual understanding
[1:26:01] of what God has been trying to get over
[1:26:03] to the church without saying it
[1:26:06] outright can you
[1:26:08] imagine here's the
[1:26:11] prophet he has now
[1:26:15] taken and placed himself at a
[1:26:20] spot where he has to get something over
[1:26:23] to you that he's not allowed to
[1:26:29] say can you imagine that means
[1:26:33] somewhere there's a secret communication
[1:26:37] that's beyond reading ink on
[1:26:40] paper yes sir brother B says when I
[1:26:42] write my wife a letter you know the
[1:26:44] story got it you know the
[1:26:47] story and brother says he said you know
[1:26:49] he says this
[1:26:51] Bible is full of secret
[1:26:54] communication
[1:26:57] yeah and you know you didn't have to
[1:27:00] tell
[1:27:01] David look at the seven seal so so
[1:27:08] Saul cuz he's not got what it takes to
[1:27:11] overcome Goliath and David says this
[1:27:14] isn't about killing Goliath this is the
[1:27:16] war of the Gods
[1:27:18] man he just insulted my
[1:27:21] God this is not about what's H this is
[1:27:24] an insult to my God that's what this
[1:27:28] is and David
[1:27:31] recognized spiritual food and due season
[1:27:34] recognized this day the scripture
[1:27:36] fulfilled David knew the all of Israel
[1:27:39] was under an
[1:27:41] indictment if there wasn't a mercy Angel
[1:27:44] come and take on
[1:27:46] Goliath so David he you didn't have to
[1:27:50] tell David what to
[1:27:52] do does this make sense David you didn't
[1:27:55] have to tell David David knows that's
[1:27:57] his Target that he knows but now he's
[1:28:00] relying on what's not spoken to do
[1:28:04] what's right he heads off to a brook and
[1:28:07] he gets five Stones smooth Stones you
[1:28:11] can only have smooth stones in Living
[1:28:14] Waters amen you don't produce smooth
[1:28:17] stones in a swamp you need rivers of
[1:28:22] Living Water pass those stones to smooth
[1:28:26] them up by the way and he goes and gets
[1:28:30] five smooth stones from Living Waters
[1:28:35] and then he takes those smooth stones
[1:28:37] and he puts it in a
[1:28:39] script he doesn't put it in his pouch no
[1:28:42] sir why doesn't he put it in the pouch
[1:28:46] cuz he's revealing a
[1:28:48] mystery because the script is a secret
[1:28:51] little pocket that only the owner has
[1:28:53] access to that seven seal is where the
[1:28:57] five-fold ministry needs to
[1:28:59] be he takes those secret those stones
[1:29:03] puts them in the secret script puts it
[1:29:06] and closes the pouch out why he's
[1:29:08] showing you something about
[1:29:10] yourself when you're going to hit your
[1:29:13] Goliath cuz you're going to need a
[1:29:16] living water fivefold ministry under the
[1:29:19] anointing of that seven seal for your
[1:29:22] Target to hit the Bulls
[1:29:25] amen but you didn't have to tell David
[1:29:28] that he was living at a mystery that he
[1:29:30] himself had no ink on paper
[1:29:33] [Applause]
[1:29:41] for
[1:29:45] why because he that
[1:29:48] sanctifies and he that is
[1:29:52] Sanctified are both on the equal terms
[1:29:55] call themselves Brethren
[1:30:00] yes brother brandom
[1:30:03] said you know this message is amazing to
[1:30:09] me it's flat out amazing to me because
[1:30:15] what it does it doesn't just give you
[1:30:17] it's not ink on this this message is not
[1:30:21] ink on
[1:30:22] paper this message is secret
[1:30:25] communication looking for a wife cuz you
[1:30:28] could read the ink on paper and never
[1:30:30] produce a
[1:30:31] wife that's right because a wife is
[1:30:34] equal to the husband because he that
[1:30:37] sanctifieth and he that is Sanctified is
[1:30:40] equal and he can call them Brethren on
[1:30:42] the same plane which means that he that
[1:30:44] is Sanctified has the mind of the
[1:30:48] sanctifier that's why brother B says let
[1:30:51] me show you in the back part of your
[1:30:52] husband's mind let me show you what the
[1:30:54] three-fold purpose is number one that
[1:30:57] he's going to take excuse me and number
[1:31:00] one he's got a three-fold purpose in the
[1:31:01] back part of his mind you understand
[1:31:04] what's he doing revealing himself what's
[1:31:06] the next thing he has a preeminence
[1:31:08] what's the purpose restore the kingdom
[1:31:10] but only the bride knows that what's in
[1:31:13] the husband's mind what's he doing you
[1:31:16] putting you in the position as
[1:31:22] wife
[1:31:29] why
[1:31:31] so what's been happening to me in the
[1:31:33] last couple of 10 years I don't know
[1:31:36] this book is a brand new book man
[1:31:40] yes I don't know what happened to
[1:31:44] me I don't know what happened to me but
[1:31:46] I know when it happened to me I used to
[1:31:49] read the message at this
[1:31:52] level
[1:31:55] and now I'm reading the same message yes
[1:31:59] but I'm seeing something totally
[1:32:00] different
[1:32:01] more the message hasn't changed I've
[1:32:05] changed I've been moved from there to
[1:32:07] there come up a little higher let me
[1:32:09] show you
[1:32:11] something you've been
[1:32:13] invited Elijah was invited into the
[1:32:16] Chariot John was invited to come up a
[1:32:19] little higher and you know what es Ruth
[1:32:22] ended up at his feet but she had to be
[1:32:23] invited to a side you can't barge your
[1:32:26] way into heaven you need an
[1:32:29] [Applause]
[1:32:30] invitation thank
[1:32:38] you let me go a little bit further I'm
[1:32:40] not getting very far what time is it
[1:32:42] take your time brother no man we got
[1:32:52] dinner yes amen see it's the thing
[1:32:57] sometimes we have to say things in such
[1:32:59] a way that it might thin down it might
[1:33:01] bring some to go out some to leave some
[1:33:05] to ponder over it's done that way
[1:33:07] purposely it must be done that way cuz
[1:33:11] not everybody's going to be listening to
[1:33:13] for what's not
[1:33:22] spoken
[1:33:29] I like this am Psalm
[1:33:33] says he made known his
[1:33:36] ways to
[1:33:38] Moses his AXS unto the children of
[1:33:41] Israel you mean to tell me that you
[1:33:43] could be enjoying the acts of Moses and
[1:33:46] don't know the ways of
[1:33:52] Moses you you mean to tell me that you
[1:33:55] could walk through the
[1:33:57] river and not have any of your shoes
[1:34:00] wear out and have benefit of the Mana
[1:34:03] have benefit of the quail and still not
[1:34:05] know the ways of the Prophet you mean to
[1:34:08] tell me that you could be in the first
[1:34:09] in second pull and know the benefits of
[1:34:11] the Prophet but not know the ways of the
[1:34:19] Prophet could it be that the acts of the
[1:34:22] Prophet are there to sear the conscience
[1:34:24] so you can find the
[1:34:26] ways of the Prophet if you don't
[1:34:29] understand what God's doing
[1:34:36] right Hebrews 3:10 says whereof I was
[1:34:39] grieved with that generation said they
[1:34:41] do always he in their heart they have
[1:34:44] not known my ways but they saw the
[1:34:49] axe they saw the
[1:34:52] acts but they didn't know the ways they
[1:34:55] didn't know the principles God operated
[1:34:57] by they didn't catch the mystery they
[1:34:59] didn't catch what was going on they saw
[1:35:02] the Miracles and they saw the stage show
[1:35:03] and they saw the you know all kinds of
[1:35:06] stuff and they saw you maybe I can say
[1:35:08] it like this they saw a prophet and they
[1:35:10] saw people come up on the stage and they
[1:35:13] saw people get what they asked for but
[1:35:15] that doesn't say they caught the ways of
[1:35:18] God just cuz they got
[1:35:20] healed does that make sense and the same
[1:35:23] thing has happened in church you could
[1:35:24] come to church and hear my voice but
[1:35:26] still not connect with the pattern of
[1:35:28] God in your own personal
[1:35:30] life
[1:35:37] amen
[1:35:41] H and this whole mystery like brother
[1:35:44] Brian said yesterday is actually a
[1:35:45] mystery of redemption that's right
[1:35:48] marriage boy here we go into the ways
[1:35:50] and the acts
[1:35:52] okay what is a
[1:35:54] marriage a marriage is not a man and
[1:35:57] woman living in a house no a marriage is
[1:36:01] not necessarily man and woman living in
[1:36:04] a house going to church paying ties
[1:36:06] paying off for mortgage and and uh and
[1:36:09] raising kids that doesn't say you're
[1:36:11] married
[1:36:15] did that's the
[1:36:18] acts got
[1:36:21] it but marriage is a mystery between
[1:36:25] Christ and the bride in other words you
[1:36:27] could have all of that and there's no
[1:36:29] mystery being revealed right now the
[1:36:33] acts are all
[1:36:35] there but still miss the ways of what
[1:36:39] actually a marriage
[1:36:43] is what's a marriage Ephesians 5 a
[1:36:48] mystery between Christ and the chur
[1:36:53] right
[1:36:56] so the church the
[1:37:00] female is dependent on the
[1:37:04] male for Redemption because Redemption
[1:37:07] always goes male to
[1:37:13] female so there's acts and then there's
[1:37:18] ways the axe if you're listening with
[1:37:22] the right ear will show the
[1:37:25] ways and the point I'm making is a
[1:37:27] marriage is a
[1:37:30] mystery between Christ and the church or
[1:37:33] the bride and he's the one that can hold
[1:37:37] her
[1:37:38] blameless amen catch me now okay let me
[1:37:42] make it real plain honestly
[1:37:45] plain in the right act of
[1:37:48] redemption when that boy comes up here
[1:37:51] with that girl comes up here
[1:37:54] if that girl has been one has had 100%
[1:38:00] disclosure got it do we have to come to
[1:38:04] Christ with 100%
[1:38:06] disclosure do we do we need Christ to
[1:38:10] redeem us can we pick ourselves up by
[1:38:13] our
[1:38:14] bootstraps can we redeem ourselves let
[1:38:17] me ask a question every one of you came
[1:38:20] condemned the minute you were born
[1:38:22] you're going to hell
[1:38:24] why because you came by sex birth the
[1:38:26] fact that you came by sex birth
[1:38:28] guarantees you're going to hell and the
[1:38:30] point of it is you came wrong my
[1:38:32] question to you is a man cannot lift
[1:38:35] another man to a higher level it takes
[1:38:39] somebody that's not born by sex to pull
[1:38:42] a sex man up to his
[1:38:44] level because every one of us came wrong
[1:38:47] in the first place and coming to church
[1:38:50] won't fix that Redemption comes from
[1:38:53] male to female and this church my church
[1:38:56] cannot produce one single son and
[1:39:00] daughter of God because it takes the
[1:39:02] male Jesus Christ to come in his word to
[1:39:06] redeem you in this church if Christ
[1:39:08] doesn't come you're going to
[1:39:10] hell because this church can't save
[1:39:15] you that's the truth
[1:39:18] true and when that boy and girl come
[1:39:22] there the it's an act of redemption it's
[1:39:25] not just signing a paper and having a
[1:39:28] preacher pronounce and then going off
[1:39:31] that's not what it is that boy and girl
[1:39:34] are coming to here and there's a man of
[1:39:36] God with a spoken word oh Lord help me
[1:39:39] now man I have wondered this Lord you
[1:39:43] know so often brother I feel I I don't
[1:39:45] feel you know the other day or it's the
[1:39:48] other day I'm over 50 so it's the other
[1:39:50] day right I'm preaching at brother Ron
[1:39:54] at brother Chad's and I feel completely
[1:39:56] lost I'm under condemnation I don't feel
[1:40:00] good about myself and I'm struggling
[1:40:02] with my own self and then he asked me to
[1:40:04] preach well much to my surprise I preach
[1:40:07] anyway and it doesn't matter how I feel
[1:40:08] God still comes and I'm wondering where
[1:40:11] does that come
[1:40:15] from listen your salvation is not
[1:40:18] dependent on how you
[1:40:22] feel
[1:40:24] that's it when that boy and girl come up
[1:40:27] over here this is an act of redemption
[1:40:29] if that girl has been 100% honest and
[1:40:31] open and if he takes her on that basis
[1:40:35] he cleans her up 100% she has no
[1:40:40] condemnation and dare he ever remind her
[1:40:43] of what she did wrong cuz then he breaks
[1:40:45] his own vow when he does that dare that
[1:40:49] husband shame the wife after he takes
[1:40:51] her in full confession because the
[1:40:54] husband redeems that wife and it doesn't
[1:40:56] matter what condition she's in if he is
[1:40:58] a Son of God he can clean her up redeem
[1:41:02] her and set her free by that marriage
[1:41:06] vow brother Brandon says I'm not waiting
[1:41:09] for the wedding I'm waiting for the
[1:41:11] reception we are married right
[1:41:14] now Hall we're not celebrating under the
[1:41:18] Feast of atonement we're celebrating
[1:41:20] under the Feast of of Tabernacles we
[1:41:22] have been through the marriage we're
[1:41:25] rejoicing going on to the wedding
[1:41:28] supper thank you
[1:41:30] Lord You
[1:41:36] Lord see now I'm pulling up my machine
[1:41:44] gun let me get back to my single
[1:41:52] shot
[1:41:59] you could be in this
[1:42:01] message and not
[1:42:04] realize who is
[1:42:06] here for what
[1:42:09] purpose to take away your
[1:42:11] condemnation and if you've been 100%
[1:42:14] honest with your husband he can redeem
[1:42:16] you back to Virgin status one more time
[1:42:19] because Redemption goes from male to
[1:42:22] female
[1:42:25] you could memorize this message and be a
[1:42:27] lousy wife to
[1:42:32] Christ am I making
[1:42:35] sense you could be a preacher behind the
[1:42:37] pulpit preaching this message and owe
[1:42:39] people money back there that you don't
[1:42:41] want to shake their hands cuz you fill
[1:42:42] some money off of them and you're not
[1:42:44] mad enough to go make that right but
[1:42:46] you're behind this Pulpit
[1:42:52] preaching
[1:42:53] you shouldn't be behind the pulpit you
[1:42:56] should go make that right first pay that
[1:42:57] guy
[1:42:58] back so you can shake his hand and pray
[1:43:01] for
[1:43:16] him they saw the
[1:43:18] acts they didn't recognize the
[1:43:22] ways
[1:43:24] marriage goes from male to
[1:43:27] female this church can't produce one
[1:43:31] single son and daughter of God not
[1:43:35] one not
[1:43:36] one this church is
[1:43:39] female a woman can't bring a boy to
[1:43:41] manhood
[1:43:43] yeah a woman cannot even bring a girl to
[1:43:46] Womanhood yeah it takes a man a father
[1:43:51] to bring a boy to manhood it takes a
[1:43:53] father to bring a girl to
[1:43:56] Womanhood these are the ways of
[1:44:05] God and Adam had to meet four
[1:44:07] requirements for Redemption the first
[1:44:10] Adam he was a spoken seed word of God
[1:44:13] and he was given a bride to reproduce
[1:44:15] himself and that's why the bride was
[1:44:17] given to him to reproduce himself to
[1:44:19] produce another Son of God because why
[1:44:22] at the end of the today you can't be a
[1:44:25] better parent than you are a
[1:44:36] spouse you can't be a better parent than
[1:44:38] you are a
[1:44:42] spouse these are the ways of
[1:44:46] God you know in the Garden of Eden you
[1:44:49] have an Adam and an eve their marriage
[1:44:51] was already perfect and God said said it
[1:44:53] is good there's no
[1:44:56] children
[1:44:59] yeah you think you're a good
[1:45:03] parent check the way your marriage is
[1:45:05] and check your spouse if you're a good
[1:45:07] spouse
[1:45:12] true I think I'm a good
[1:45:15] pastor I better check to see if I'm
[1:45:17] still wife to Jesus Christ
[1:45:20] first does that make sense to you
[1:45:25] yes I'm no better Pastor than I am
[1:45:36] wife until
[1:45:39] you until you're a good wife to Christ
[1:45:42] you can't even love your children
[1:45:45] correctly
[1:45:48] true these are the ways of
[1:45:51] God
[1:45:53] can you imagine a father or a father
[1:45:55] doesn't take foot washing communion
[1:45:57] pretending he loves his
[1:45:59] children what a
[1:46:02] liar get right with Christ
[1:46:09] first can you Mt her father he he steals
[1:46:12] God's tie cuz God pays everybody 10% too
[1:46:15] much right can you imagine him being a
[1:46:17] thief stealing God's ties and then
[1:46:19] pretending he loves his
[1:46:21] wife come on tell you what Dad you get
[1:46:24] right with Christ first
[1:46:28] amen does that make sense can you
[1:46:31] imagine me thinking I'm a good pastor
[1:46:33] and I've got condemnation between me and
[1:46:40] Christ do you know why God was so hard
[1:46:42] on brother
[1:46:45] Brandon cuz he loved you true and you
[1:46:50] and you and you
[1:46:53] and when brother brandom got his mind on
[1:46:55] his mother-in-law and was debating that
[1:46:57] battle what did God do he jerked his
[1:47:00] lead sank he did you got no right to
[1:47:03] take your eyes off of me cuz I've got
[1:47:05] you and you and you and you to be
[1:47:09] saved thank you
[1:47:11] Lord that's true
[1:47:14] brother I don't know what time what time
[1:47:16] is it
[1:47:19] R quarter to
[1:47:21] 12
[1:47:23] only a father can bring a boy to
[1:47:27] manhood that's why Jesus when he was 12
[1:47:30] years
[1:47:32] old remember his mom as a 12-year-old
[1:47:36] boy the woman's always hanging on to the
[1:47:37] boy right and that's good but the boy
[1:47:41] had to undergo the experience of
[1:47:43] breaking away from a female so he could
[1:47:45] be adopted by his
[1:47:49] dad and a man that if the I told my
[1:47:52] church this a while
[1:47:54] ago if I'm here creating a dependency on
[1:47:58] you and you depend on me and I depend on
[1:48:01] you you can't do me no
[1:48:03] good if you can't leave my church for
[1:48:05] the word's sake you can't help
[1:48:07] us you better get Christ first and then
[1:48:11] find out what church you're going to
[1:48:13] that's right because a man that can't
[1:48:16] walk away from a woman can't redeem
[1:48:19] her a church is a woman yeah
[1:48:25] Peter James and John they were in the
[1:48:26] Mount of
[1:48:27] transfiguration and here they saw the
[1:48:29] father adopt the son what's the first
[1:48:32] thing they did they wanted to run to the
[1:48:33] woman for a completion let's build three
[1:48:37] churches what do you do and you saw the
[1:48:40] father adopt the son and you're running
[1:48:42] to a woman for
[1:48:45] completion the denominations came to
[1:48:48] brother Brandon the woman and said
[1:48:49] listen buddy you want to just lay off a
[1:48:51] little bit on this preaching will'll buy
[1:48:53] you a jet we'll give you a home how much
[1:48:56] salary do you want you know what that
[1:48:58] was the woman after the
[1:49:01] prophet do you know why Joseph could
[1:49:04] break away from pifer's wife cuz he
[1:49:06] valued his relationship with the seven
[1:49:08] colored Rob that his father gave him his
[1:49:11] father's relationship in the seven color
[1:49:13] Covenant was more important than that
[1:49:15] woman chasing him and he could run away
[1:49:18] from that woman only because he was
[1:49:20] attached to his father and and a man
[1:49:23] that won't redeem a son will get caught
[1:49:25] by a woman and the woman is selling a
[1:49:28] mystery you come to me I'll Make a Man
[1:49:31] Out of You that's the
[1:49:35] lie that's the
[1:49:38] LIE cuz a woman can't take a boy to
[1:49:41] manhood only a father can take a boy to
[1:49:47] manhood the ways of
[1:49:51] God
[1:50:07] his machine guns down there I'll just
[1:50:09] pick up my single
[1:50:16] shot it's qu to 12 huh Mark
[1:50:21] 16
[1:50:27] 14 oh boy
[1:50:33] Lord only a father can bring a boy to
[1:50:37] manhood a mother cannot do
[1:50:39] that only a father can bring a girl to
[1:50:42] Womanhood a mother cannot do that you
[1:50:45] notice the woman that was caught in
[1:50:47] adultery
[1:50:48] and she was the church was the one
[1:50:51] trying to condemn her
[1:50:53] but she had to go to the mail to be
[1:50:58] freed you know the woman that came into
[1:51:00] Matthew 26 with the alabaster
[1:51:03] box huh you're going to see it right
[1:51:06] away here's the priest the church
[1:51:09] condemning that woman right because of
[1:51:12] what she had done but notice she knew
[1:51:14] where to go for
[1:51:18] adoption Oh Lordy help me now
[1:51:21] Brian
[1:51:26] Mark 14
[1:51:28] remember he that sanctify
[1:51:31] us and he that
[1:51:35] Sanctified are equal he can call them
[1:51:38] Brethren
[1:51:39] yeah oh this is going to be my last
[1:51:42] point and I promise not to pull up my
[1:51:43] machine
[1:51:46] gun
[1:51:47] when David appeared on the scene
[1:51:50] remember the number eight is always
[1:51:52] always mixed up with seven true
[1:51:56] okay so in one Bible part of the Bible
[1:51:59] David they said David is the Seventh Son
[1:52:02] another part of the Bible David says
[1:52:03] that he's the eighth son actually
[1:52:05] there's a mystery there because seven
[1:52:07] the number eight comes out of the number
[1:52:09] seven in eternity because we're in the
[1:52:11] seventh Church age but okay maybe you're
[1:52:14] in the
[1:52:15] seventh lady oia is the seventh Church
[1:52:18] age but I'm living in the eighth round
[1:52:21] maybe I can say it that way okay got it
[1:52:24] all right that's
[1:52:26] good when David
[1:52:29] appears there's a mystery in him there's
[1:52:31] a king in him but he doesn't know
[1:52:35] it right the prophet
[1:52:38] comes and he takes the
[1:52:41] oil and he pours it in a
[1:52:44] horn and he takes the oil and pours it
[1:52:47] over David's head and the oil connects
[1:52:50] the head to the body
[1:52:54] but it starts from the head goes all the
[1:52:57] way to the body right
[1:53:01] right in this generation the head came
[1:53:04] in' 63 yeah but we needed a prophet to
[1:53:08] anoint that had to show us what was
[1:53:10] happening and he took the anointing from
[1:53:13] the head and poured the same
[1:53:15] sing on the bride the church with his
[1:53:19] oil understand yeah all right the the
[1:53:22] prophet connected the
[1:53:24] body and the head yeah because there was
[1:53:28] a king inside of
[1:53:30] David oh now I don't want to do that
[1:53:32] either there was a king inside of David
[1:53:36] but the prophet had to come and anoint
[1:53:38] him with a horn of
[1:53:39] oil notice the prophet anoints David
[1:53:45] with a horn of oil but Saul with a horn
[1:53:47] with a
[1:53:48] vial true the same Prophet yeah now now
[1:53:52] you've got vessels of
[1:53:56] honor and vessels of
[1:53:58] Dishonor anointed by the same
[1:54:02] [Applause]
[1:54:06] Prophet brother Brandon goes to
[1:54:08] Revelations
[1:54:10] 219 and tells you it's the vile angel
[1:54:13] that says let me show you the wife yeah
[1:54:16] then he goes to Genesis 24 with
[1:54:19] elaser and he connects the elzer
[1:54:21] ministry with the vile
[1:54:23] Angel why cuz the same Prophet that made
[1:54:26] opening for you brings the tribulation
[1:54:29] to the rest of the
[1:54:32] world he anoints one with a vial and one
[1:54:35] with a
[1:54:38] horn that's why the Bible says and the
[1:54:40] angel with the seven V said let me show
[1:54:42] you this woman
[1:54:45] right so the point I'm making all I want
[1:54:48] to get back to him getting carried away
[1:54:49] here now this this machine gun's coming
[1:54:51] out all the time
[1:54:53] is that the
[1:54:54] prophet anoints the head and runs it all
[1:54:59] the way down to connect the head and the
[1:55:01] body CU he knows his ministry and the
[1:55:05] effect of what it will leave in the
[1:55:07] bride right but there's a prophecy in
[1:55:10] scripture where there's another woman
[1:55:12] that thinks it not robbery to be equal
[1:55:15] yeah oh
[1:55:18] Lordy Mark 14 and this is my last place
[1:55:22] I'm going to cut everything off Mark
[1:55:25] 14:3 and being in Bethany in the house
[1:55:28] of Simon the leper as he sat at meat
[1:55:30] there came a woman with an alabaster box
[1:55:33] of ointment of nard very precious
[1:55:37] and she broke the box and poured it upon
[1:55:40] his what is she oh what is she doing
[1:55:46] pouring it on his head that's a
[1:55:48] prophet's
[1:55:51] position
[1:55:53] but she's read indictment she knows her
[1:55:56] time in the season she knows this is the
[1:55:58] day the scriptures fulfilled she's
[1:56:01] recognizing her day and her hour she
[1:56:03] knows Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:56:05] and she's not ashamed to be called equal
[1:56:08] with her husband
[1:56:09] Hallelujah glory god
[1:56:13] Glory Hallelujah
[1:56:18] Hallelujah what do you think you're
[1:56:20] doing woman
[1:56:22] you're supposed to be like ask Ruth and
[1:56:24] get to the feet
[1:56:27] yeah but she has got a mystery written
[1:56:31] in her life for you for you for you to
[1:56:35] think yourself not robbery to be equal
[1:56:38] with what God has given you look what
[1:56:40] God has invested in
[1:56:43] you in the
[1:56:46] scriptures but
[1:56:48] notice she had to take that wax
[1:56:55] the ointment they had in those days
[1:56:57] there was a clay jar then they took wax
[1:57:00] and heated it until it was liquid and
[1:57:02] then they sealed the lid with the liquid
[1:57:07] Vox
[1:57:10] notice the seal that seven seal had to
[1:57:14] be broke first before the revelation of
[1:57:17] the first six seals were released that's
[1:57:19] true
[1:57:20] amen and she she got the alabaster box
[1:57:24] she knew how precious the ointment
[1:57:28] was but she knew that she's the one that
[1:57:31] had to come and break that seal off of
[1:57:34] the top to release the Revelation to the
[1:57:37] bride and here she's got that box and
[1:57:40] she's
[1:57:41] nervous cuz Simon the lepers just
[1:57:44] looking for an Avenue to condemn her and
[1:57:47] she's under the condemnation of the
[1:57:49] church but she's not going to church for
[1:57:51] Relief cuz that's female she's going to
[1:57:55] Christ for Relief the
[1:57:58] male cuz only a male a
[1:58:03] father can take a girl and bring her
[1:58:06] into Womanhood God bless you I'm
[1:58:12] [Applause]
[1:58:16] [Music]
[1:58:20] done mus if you want to
[1:58:24] come you know I'd like to teach you a
[1:58:26] little song If you want to stand and
[1:58:27] change your position a little
[1:58:30] bit last night I rejoiced like crazy to
[1:58:34] see when brother Brian polished that
[1:58:36] stone and there was The Taking of the
[1:58:38] book One More Time right
[1:58:40] yeah do you
[1:58:42] know I'm thankful that he came and took
[1:58:46] the book with my name in okay that's
[1:58:49] number one but number two it shouldn't
[1:58:51] stay there yeah because the parents
[1:58:54] should become a lamb also a slaying lamb
[1:58:58] also to take the book with their
[1:59:01] children's name in
[1:59:03] it cuz all that God was he poured into
[1:59:07] and all that Christ he poured
[1:59:09] into so what Christ did for us we've got
[1:59:13] the ability and the position to do for
[1:59:15] our
[1:59:17] family because the book holds our family
[1:59:20] names so I'm happy that Christ came and
[1:59:24] redeemed me now that's true but the
[1:59:28] story doesn't end there because remember
[1:59:31] John eats the book but now we as
[1:59:34] ministers and as family and as
[1:59:37] dads if we'll get off of our high
[1:59:42] horse and become a slain
[1:59:46] lamb and become the
[1:59:49] sacrifice the way that that lamb was for
[1:59:51] me we can come in the volume of the book
[1:59:54] in the way
[1:59:56] remember they saw the acts but they
[1:59:59] didn't know the ways well I'm telling
[2:00:00] you the ways all that God was is in you
[2:00:03] now and if God came and took the book
[2:00:06] for you you can take the book for
[2:00:07] somebody
[2:00:09] [Music]
[2:00:12] else but you know what it does
[2:00:15] though it takes somebody
