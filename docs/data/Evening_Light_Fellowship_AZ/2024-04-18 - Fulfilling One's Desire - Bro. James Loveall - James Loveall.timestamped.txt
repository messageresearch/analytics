[31:35] you you know I came into a a shop this
[31:40] week and a man sat at his desk and I can
[31:44] see it written all over his face he had
[31:46] just read a
[31:50] text and he was troubled and I said
[31:53] everything all right he says I don't
[31:56] know yet but he kind of brushed it off
[31:59] and we talked a little bit and I
[32:03] Left Something Something Told me go back
[32:06] and pray for that
[32:08] man I went back in there and I began to
[32:10] talk to him and I said sir I'm I'm a
[32:13] Christian and I I want to pray with you
[32:15] would you mind if I pray with
[32:18] you and he kind of stood up and he threw
[32:21] his shoulders back and he says I'm all
[32:23] right I don't need
[32:25] that he says and I also have you to know

[33:02] he's so real that you can call him onto

[35:07] tonight and uh I certainly want to make
[35:09] him welcome and he's been a mentor and
[35:13] somebody that I have a lot of respect
[35:15] for you know those teachers that inspire
[35:18] you and yes they instill things in you
[35:20] in the high school years of your life
[35:22] and he was my high school basketball
[35:24] coach and uh you know we may have but it
[35:28] heads a little
[35:29] bit but it's a respect that I have for
[35:33] him and an appreciation for him and you
[35:36] know even something that is instilled in
[35:38] me is he he would tell me or he' tell
[35:41] the team whenever we were
[35:43] practicing he would say give me 100%
[35:47] plus
[35:48] 10% yep he says but only you know if
[35:51] you're given that extra
[35:53] 10% a lot of people know when you're
[35:55] given 100% you can see it and you're
[35:57] straining but you know deep down if you
[35:59] got a little bit more to
[36:02] give and that now it just doesn't apply
[36:05] but I still apply it today listen I give
[36:08] 110% amen and we should do the very same
[36:11] thing as Christians and message
[36:13] Believers and serving God living for God
[36:15] we should give
[36:16] 110% every day of Our Lives yes amen yes
[36:21] sir so we make you welcome Mr
[36:25] deal James 2
[36:29] in verse
[36:32] 14 it says what doth it profit my
[36:34] brethren though a man say he hath faith
[36:37] and have not works can Faith save him
[36:40] and if a brother or sister be naked and
[36:42] destitute of daily food and one of you
[36:45] say unto them depart in peace be warmed
[36:48] and filled notwithstanding ye give them
[36:51] not not those things which are needful
[36:54] to the body what doth it profit
[36:58] even so faith if it hath not works is
[37:01] dead being alone right yeah a man may
[37:05] say thou H has faith and I have Works
[37:08] show me thy faith without thy works and
[37:10] I will show you thee my faith by my
[37:15] Works thou believest that there is one
[37:18] God thou doest well thou believest that
[37:23] there was a prophet sent for this day
[37:25] thou doest well thou believest and
[37:28] knowest that thou Hast to come to church
[37:30] that doest well but guess what the devil
[37:33] believes the same
[37:36] thing he knows the same
[37:40] thing but wilt thou know oh vain man
[37:44] that faith without works is dead let's
[37:47] skip down to 26 for as the body without
[37:49] the spirit is dead so faith without
[37:52] works is dead also so we understand here
[37:56] that you can't have one without the
[37:59] other that they go hand in hand and you
[38:01] as a Christian they must go hand in hand
[38:05] it shows the very desires the very the
[38:08] conduct of a Christian is expressed here
[38:12] that your faith is expressed by your
[38:14] works or your Works expressed by your
[38:16] faith
[38:18] there and let's go to John
[38:22] 6 St John 6:38
[38:31] and I was listening today and the
[38:33] prophet said you know faith is what
[38:35] godone sees but works is what your
[38:37] neighbor
[38:39] sees it's pretty simple
[38:43] yeah St John 6 38 verse 40 or 38 to 40
[38:49] for I came from Heaven not to do my own
[38:53] will but the will of him that sent me
[38:58] we see will here is an
[38:59] expression expressing a desire or
[39:02] consent or a willingness so Jesus is
[39:04] saying I have not come down to chase
[39:07] after or to go after my own desires and
[39:10] my own will but I've come down to
[39:12] fulfill those of who has sent
[39:17] me and this is the Father's will which
[39:21] he hath sent me that of all which he
[39:24] hath given me I should lose nothing yes
[39:27] but should raise it up in the last days
[39:29] and this is the will of him that sent me
[39:31] that everyone that seeth the son and
[39:33] believeth on him may he may have
[39:37] everlasting life and I will raise him up
[39:39] in the last days what a promise that is
[39:42] amen what a promise that
[39:45] is and even in verse 38 for I have come
[39:47] down from heaven not to fulfill my own
[39:50] will right you know you and I are
[39:53] fulfilling that same scripture yes right
[39:56] yes that we have come down from heaven
[39:58] we have come from God and we're going
[40:00] back to God but are you fulfilling the
[40:03] desires of your father you can be seated
[40:06] this
[40:07] evening and so we want to look and kind
[40:10] of launch off of a a similar uh lines of
[40:14] the the expression from the heart as we
[40:16] spoke last
[40:17] time and as a man thinketh in his heart
[40:20] now we know that many s uh you know the
[40:23] science has tried to
[40:24] disprove science has tried to disprove
[40:29] thank
[40:33] you science has tried to disprove this
[40:37] of a man thinking in the heart and as we
[40:39] looked at it the last time that a man
[40:42] you know a science would say that a man
[40:43] thinks with his his mind and how can a
[40:46] man think with his heart but Jesus said
[40:48] in the word that as a man is he thinketh
[40:50] in his heart so is he and we looked at
[40:54] this and we understand as we spoke last
[40:57] time that God placed down in the heart
[40:59] of every man a soul a little portion
[41:03] that he placed there to give a man a
[41:05] soul and that's what makes Humanity so
[41:08] different than all the rest of his uh
[41:10] creation whether it be animal life or uh
[41:13] uh plant life and everything else and
[41:15] all the orbits that he created he
[41:18] created a human and he put a
[41:21] soul that they could have their own
[41:23] desires yes they can have their own
[41:26] choices yes
[41:28] make decisions of their own right and
[41:31] whatever a man the very heartbeat of a
[41:33] human lays within that
[41:36] Soul whatever he thinketh in his heart
[41:38] he
[41:39] becomes and whatever those thoughts are
[41:43] they lay dormant there and they are
[41:47] unexpressed but once you begin
[41:50] to speak those
[41:53] thoughts when those things be be you put
[41:56] them to a word
[41:57] they are now becoming expressed the very
[41:59] desires the very heartbeats of that
[42:02] heart of that human
[42:04] being and in that
[42:07] soul of the human race it don't matter
[42:09] the color the where we come from every
[42:13] one of us has that part of us in that in
[42:16] our hearts right and God operates
[42:19] there because he gives us certain
[42:22] desires certain
[42:25] wants and so tonight
[42:28] if I can talk on fulfilling one's
[42:31] desire and for a subject would be I will
[42:34] show thee my faith by my
[42:37] works now Jesus said if you if you don't
[42:41] believe me believe the works that I do
[42:43] amen for my Works testify of who I am
[42:47] yes amen listen many people might not
[42:50] understand the message they might not
[42:52] have a an understanding of what is
[42:55] happening in the prophet that was sent
[42:56] for this day and all these different
[42:58] things but yet you see that if they
[43:01] don't believe that believe the works
[43:02] that follow it yes
[43:04] amen
[43:08] sure Ephesians 2 and verse 1 and you
[43:13] have he quickened who were dead in
[43:14] trespasses and sin wherein times past
[43:17] you walked according of the course of
[43:19] this world according to the prince of
[43:21] the power of the air the spirit that now
[43:24] worketh in the children of disobedience
[43:28] among whom also we had our conversations
[43:32] in times past in the lust of our flesh
[43:35] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[43:37] of the mind and were by Nature the
[43:39] children of Wrath even as
[43:42] others fulfilling our desires fulfilling
[43:45] our wants our desires of the mind and of
[43:48] the flesh but God who is rich in mercy
[43:51] God who is rich in Mercy for his great
[43:54] love wherewith he loved us you Lord even
[43:58] when we were dead in sins hath quickened
[44:01] us together with Christ by Grace by
[44:05] grace are you
[44:06] saved amen I'm so thankful for the grace
[44:10] and the mercy of almighty
[44:13] God
[44:19] Wonder now remember that you're in a
[44:21] battle and you're constantly going
[44:24] through this Warfare
[44:29] and if we're not
[44:31] careful you got
[44:38] me always H there it
[44:41] is always happens to
[44:47] me but if we're not careful Mark 4 19
[44:50] says and the cares of this world and the
[44:52] deceitfulness of riches and the lust of
[44:55] the other things entering in choke out
[44:57] the word and it becometh
[45:01] unfruitful and so you see the cares of
[45:03] this world and this deceitfulness of
[45:06] riches and the lust of other things
[45:08] entering in and I love how he leaves it
[45:10] open-ended that the lust of other
[45:14] things the lust of other
[45:17] things why because we're all different
[45:19] we're all made up a different we all
[45:21] have different desires and lust of this
[45:23] and lust of that maybe lust of sports or
[45:26] the desire of sports or the desires of
[45:28] wanting do this or careers or whatever
[45:31] it may be the lust of other
[45:34] things he leaves it
[45:37] open-ended so us as humans we can't put
[45:41] say you know many times that's what we
[45:42] try to do is we try to push the
[45:46] boundaries we try to push the boundaries
[45:48] as if we put something on it then you
[45:51] can say well he didn't mention that or
[45:53] he didn't say
[45:55] this but the lust of other things
[45:57] includes us all and I say Lord help us
[46:00] don't let those other things encumber us
[46:04] because we want to be fruitful
[46:05] Christians we want to produce fruit some
[46:07] 30-fold some 60-fold some 100-fold but
[46:11] as long as you're producing fruit is
[46:12] what
[46:13] matters that's right because you see the
[46:16] cares of this life it says it doesn't
[46:18] choke it and kill it so the tree is
[46:20] still alive but it takes away the fruit
[46:23] but let me ask you what good is a fruit
[46:26] tree to a farm armor if it doesn't
[46:27] produce any fruit think about it yeah
[46:31] amen what good is
[46:33] it what good are you as a Christian if
[46:36] you're not willing to produce fruit for
[46:40] Christ right help us to be Christians
[46:44] that always bear fruit that people can
[46:46] come and glean on I don't want to be a
[46:48] Christian that is going overcoming and
[46:50] then undergoing and overcoming and
[46:53] undergoing and as the Bible says that
[46:55] the the husband men would have to come
[46:57] and dung around the tree one more time
[46:59] and then he goes through a cycle in life
[47:01] and then he comes through something else
[47:03] and then you got to dig around it again
[47:04] and then you got to dig it around it
[47:06] again let us be fruitful
[47:09] Christians yes our works testify of our
[47:13] desires I want to take the contrast or
[47:16] let's say the negative side of you know
[47:18] some of our desires as humans or as
[47:23] Humanity because the Bible says the
[47:25] cares of this world is we've read the
[47:27] worldly desires choke out the word which
[47:30] is most important in our
[47:33] lives it's fulfilling our own
[47:36] desires fulfilling our own
[47:40] wants and there was one in the very
[47:42] beginning that began to express his very
[47:45] own desires and his own wants yeah in
[47:47] Isaiah 14 and 12 he says how Thou Art
[47:51] fallen from
[47:52] Heaven listen how Thou Art fallen from
[47:55] Heaven there's a difference between
[47:57] coming from heaven and falling from
[47:58] Heaven
[48:00] yeah did you catch it there's a
[48:02] difference from falling and coming from
[48:04] Heaven Jesus said I have come from
[48:06] Heaven to fulfill my father's will and
[48:09] that's exactly what we have come this
[48:11] evening to do is to fulfill our father's
[48:16] will that's good
[48:18] brother how th are fallen from
[48:22] Heaven one is being sent to fulfill and
[48:26] one is coming down because of loss of
[48:28] position yes loss of power yes sure oh
[48:33] Lucifer son of the morning how art there
[48:35] cut down from to the ground which thou
[48:38] weaken the Nations for thou has said in
[48:41] thine heart I will Ascend into the
[48:43] heavens I will exalt my throne above the
[48:45] stars of God I will I will sit also upon
[48:50] the Mount of the congregation in the
[48:52] sides of the north and I will Ascend
[48:54] above the highest of the clouds I will
[48:56] be like the most
[49:02] high you see where his desires
[49:06] laid it's an i i i i mentality in a me
[49:12] me me
[49:14] mentality if you look at society
[49:17] today it's all about themselves people
[49:21] make everything about
[49:23] themselves it's a selfish desire
[49:27] I will do this and I will put my career
[49:30] above my family and I I will put my this
[49:33] over that and you put preeminence over
[49:36] the things of the world and things that
[49:37] don't matter so much but you see why
[49:40] when things Begin to Fall Apart families
[49:43] begin a man that works too hard and he
[49:45] spends all his hours in the office and
[49:47] I'm going to do this for myself and I'm
[49:49] going to I want to move up the corporate
[49:50] chain and I want to do this and let he
[49:53] leaves his family
[49:55] behind he leaves his kids he neglects
[49:59] his kids then we wonder what happens
[50:01] what is happening to this
[50:05] generation marriage has become so
[50:09] selfish right that give me my own
[50:11] desires that's what it's
[50:13] for and we're not there to fulfill the
[50:16] desires of our spouse to give them what
[50:18] they have need
[50:23] of and something came anybody know what
[50:27] a prenup
[50:29] is blows my
[50:32] mind why get married in the first
[50:40] place right it's like why and now people
[50:43] don't even take that step to get married
[50:45] why because then we got to go through
[50:47] the process of divorce why is divorce so
[50:49] rampant amongst our society there's no
[50:53] commitment there's no
[50:54] nothing true and they want to sign a
[50:57] prenup just so they don't have to then
[51:00] we let's just just in case it don't work
[51:03] out the sad part is is sometimes
[51:05] Christians want to do the same
[51:08] thing just in case it don't work
[51:14] out I say Lord help check our motives
[51:17] check our
[51:19] desires because you see the neglection
[51:22] toward kids and people want to blame the
[51:23] kids but the parents are the ones that
[51:25] are working too much and leaving them
[51:28] behind sending them to
[51:31] daycare having somebody else raise
[51:34] them and you say well brother James I
[51:37] don't send my kids to daycare I send
[51:39] them to daycare
[51:42] grandparents it's a good
[51:46] substitute it's a good substitute but
[51:48] that's not the home is supposed to be
[51:50] right because if the mom wants to work
[51:51] too much and wants to be in the career
[51:53] and I understand we got to do what we
[51:55] have to and we're living in a society
[51:58] where we make decisions and we make
[52:00] choices and I understand times get hard
[52:03] and sometimes they say well you have to
[52:04] have dual income and you got to do
[52:07] this but yet check your motives and your
[52:11] desires check the reasons behind it
[52:15] because if you're not fulfilling your
[52:16] desires as a mom being the Fifth Gospel
[52:19] to the kids something's
[52:21] wrong though the grandparents is good
[52:25] though it might be somebody in the
[52:33] church you see from a very young
[52:37] age you don't have to teach a kid to be
[52:41] selfish it's my
[52:44] toy this is
[52:46] mine you got to teach them to
[52:49] share when they get a younger sibling
[52:52] then they want more attention
[52:56] right but you see the desires of a
[52:59] kid you know we just went on this short
[53:02] little camping
[53:03] trip and we took a group photo and noan
[53:06] wants to see himself in the
[53:08] photo I see me I see me so you got to
[53:12] zoom
[53:14] in you think it's funny but you guys do
[53:17] the same
[53:18] thing every photo you guys take in a
[53:21] group setting who's the first person you
[53:22] zoom in on
[53:27] make sure you look good your hair's done
[53:29] right oh we got to retake it my eyes are
[53:32] closed you only care about yourself in
[53:34] the
[53:37] photo we're just being truthful it's
[53:39] just our flesh it's the desires of this
[53:41] flesh it's
[53:43] Humanity that's
[53:45] true you know from the youngest to the
[53:47] oldest we all have different desires you
[53:50] can ask the young kids what do you want
[53:51] to do what do you want to be oh what do
[53:54] you what do you want to do today if you
[53:55] ask no only wants to play ball every day
[53:57] after
[53:58] work if you ask somebody else it might
[54:00] be something else and there's nothing
[54:02] wrong with those desires it just depends
[54:03] on the stage of life that we're
[54:06] in in the variety of groups of the group
[54:09] that we have here they can differ from
[54:11] east to west
[54:20] Amen brother brandham says in a thinking
[54:22] man's filter he says when you come into
[54:24] this world you were born in sin
[54:27] you didn't even come with a Fighting
[54:30] Chance you were born in sin shaped in
[54:33] iniquity come into the world speaking
[54:34] lives within your own Spirit the desires
[54:37] of sin and the love of sin because you
[54:40] were born in sin you didn't have a
[54:42] chance that's
[54:44] right but down inside you somewhere here
[54:47] you come and there was something in
[54:49] there that began to draw and you know it
[54:53] was something that told you there was a
[54:54] god somewhere and you read him in his
[54:57] word but when you use God's
[55:01] filter when you use God's filter which
[55:04] is a thinking man's filter because all
[55:07] other filters will pass away but mine
[55:09] shall
[55:10] not and when you take God's filter and
[55:13] draw your life your desires if you draw
[55:15] your desires through God's filter a
[55:17] thinking man's filter there is nothing
[55:20] left but the Holy Ghost amen now if you
[55:23] want the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[55:25] there it is when that soul of yours will
[55:27] line up to with the word of God in every
[55:31] respect it shows you've drawn your life
[55:34] through the thinking man's filter God's
[55:37] filter what is the filter it's the word
[55:40] of
[55:42] God it's the word of God and if you take
[55:44] your desires through the word of God
[55:47] listen as we sung the song God is
[55:49] unchangeable Unstoppable but his word
[55:52] doesn't change he don't compromise for
[55:55] nobody amen
[55:57] true true
[55:59] brother that's
[56:01] [Music]
[56:02] right his filter never
[56:05] changes his word never
[56:09] changes no matter where we're at if
[56:12] we're a son or a daughter of God we
[56:13] might go through hard times even Jesus
[56:16] in the garden he came to a spot that he
[56:19] desired something else he came to a
[56:22] place that he said if it let this cup
[56:24] pass from me but if it be your will see
[56:28] he was bringing his life back into the
[56:30] filter of almighty God he was thinking
[56:33] bringing that filter back in
[56:36] line you see the prophet of this day he
[56:39] did the same exact thing he came to a
[56:41] place that he was fed up with the people
[56:43] yeah he was fed up he was tired he said
[56:47] I would go up into I wish to go up into
[56:49] the mountain I desired to go up into the
[56:51] mountain to be a hunter and be a Trapper
[56:53] and when the word of the Lord came unto
[56:55] me maybe I'll tell take that word and
[56:56] I'll go and speak unto the people and
[56:58] then I'll go
[56:59] back right but what happened yeah he had
[57:03] to bring his life back in line with that
[57:05] filter back in line with the word of
[57:09] God and God told him you lose your
[57:11] family over it your wife will leave you
[57:14] your kids they won't have nothing to do
[57:15] with
[57:16] you why because it doesn't line up with
[57:19] God's filter
[57:24] absolutely now I want to
[57:26] read this story here if we can turn to
[57:28] acts
[57:32] 8 because this is a man that had a
[57:36] desire and God knows exactly where
[57:38] you're at and what you're going
[57:43] through acts 8:26 and the angel of the
[57:46] Lord spake unto philli saying arise and
[57:48] go toward the south in the Scofield
[57:51] bible says toward the South means at
[57:53] noon time and unto the way that thou
[57:56] goest down from Jerusalem un
[57:59] Gaza which is Desert now I love that the
[58:03] Bible says here that he lets it lets us
[58:06] know that it's a desert
[58:08] place because God works in desert places
[58:11] yes he works in areas that we don't
[58:14] think is possible he he works in a place
[58:17] that who wants to go out into the middle
[58:20] of the desert at noon
[58:22] time and God will meet them there I'm
[58:26] going to send my servant there a least
[58:29] unexpected
[58:34] place because a desert represents a
[58:38] place where things aren't going
[58:40] right maybe you're dried up on
[58:47] God a place where you might have a
[58:49] question a
[58:52] desire in verse 27 and he arose and went
[58:55] and behold a man of Ethiopia unic of
[58:57] great Authority Under Candace Queen of
[59:00] the Ethiopians who had charge over all
[59:03] her treasures and had come to Jerusalem
[59:05] for to
[59:06] worship and was res returning and
[59:09] sitting in his Chariot reading isaas the
[59:13] prophet so as we look into this story we
[59:15] see that he was coming from Jerusalem he
[59:17] had already worshiped brother the
[59:19] brandom would say that he was hanging
[59:21] around the llds and the DDS and all the
[59:23] denominations of the world and he went
[59:25] into to to to study and to worship and
[59:28] do his rituals of the
[59:31] day and he would go into the city but
[59:33] then he was coming back and he was
[59:36] reading a message book for his day yeah
[59:39] he was reading a message book for his
[59:41] day and he began to read the prophet
[59:44] yeah that's good amen yes sir you know
[59:48] if we bring it down to our day
[59:50] yeah it would be you driving down 101 in
[59:54] your Frontier
[59:58] driving our car you know I think we get
[1:00:01] distracted too many
[1:00:04] times you ever have an alone time with
[1:00:06] God in a car oh yeah where he comes down
[1:00:09] and he meets you I had some special
[1:00:12] times why because you're I'm always
[1:00:13] driving but yet we get caught up and you
[1:00:16] know and they're they're not necessarily
[1:00:17] even bad things but you can get so
[1:00:19] easily
[1:00:20] distracted by listening to the radio and
[1:00:23] listening to this music or listening to
[1:00:25] a podcast everybody wants to share their
[1:00:27] opinion right so you listen to a podcast
[1:00:31] and you can listen to Dave Ramsey and
[1:00:32] listen to everybody else's
[1:00:35] problems but what good does it
[1:00:38] profit honestly what good does it
[1:00:42] profit when it's just as easy to put on
[1:00:44] the profit of the day amen and maybe you
[1:00:47] never know God may send somebody your
[1:00:51] way they begin to show you things and
[1:00:54] reveal things to you
[1:00:57] then the spirit saith unto Phillip go
[1:01:00] near and join thyself to his
[1:01:03] Chariot and Phil Philip ran thither to
[1:01:06] him and heard him read the prophet
[1:01:08] Isaiah and said understand thou what
[1:01:11] thou readest and he said how can I
[1:01:13] accept a man guide me that's it and he
[1:01:19] desired and
[1:01:22] Phillip and he desired Phillip that he
[1:01:24] would come up and sit with
[1:01:27] him now God gave
[1:01:30] me when I came across this story it
[1:01:33] might seem so
[1:01:35] small but let me tell you something your
[1:01:38] desire is what God gives God an
[1:01:41] opportunity to come on the
[1:01:43] scene right
[1:01:46] yes your desire gives God an opportunity
[1:01:49] to come down and meet you where you're
[1:01:52] at yes sir if you have a desire for more
[1:01:55] of him there's more of him to have
[1:01:58] that's
[1:01:59] right that's good a simple desire gives
[1:02:04] God an opportunity to operate and to
[1:02:06] come on the
[1:02:07] scene because we see here that the place
[1:02:10] of the scripture which he read he was
[1:02:12] led as a sheep to the slaughter like a
[1:02:15] lamb dumb before his Shear so opened not
[1:02:17] his mouth in his
[1:02:20] humiliation his judgment was taken away
[1:02:23] who shall declare his generation for his
[1:02:26] life is taken from the earth and the
[1:02:28] unic answered Phillip and said I pray
[1:02:31] thee of whom speaketh the Prophet this
[1:02:33] himself or some other man and Philip
[1:02:36] opened his mouth and began with that
[1:02:39] same scripture and preached unto him
[1:02:42] Jesus
[1:02:44] Hallelujah
[1:02:46] Jesus he didn't preach the Creeds he
[1:02:48] didn't show them all the seals he didn't
[1:02:50] break open everything he preached unto
[1:02:52] him
[1:02:54] Jesus yes
[1:02:57] all you have to do is share what Jesus
[1:03:00] has done for you share what God's done
[1:03:03] for you in your life yes that's what
[1:03:06] will make a
[1:03:08] difference sure does many times we
[1:03:10] stumble too many because we got try to
[1:03:12] get them to a certain point we try to
[1:03:15] tell them everything we know and your
[1:03:16] name's written in the book and this book
[1:03:18] and that book and they're like what book
[1:03:20] am I
[1:03:23] in right because we see it but it takes
[1:03:26] Revelation and understanding to catch
[1:03:29] those things but just preach unto him
[1:03:31] Jesus
[1:03:36] amen and as they went there where they
[1:03:38] came a certain
[1:03:41] water and the unic said see here is
[1:03:45] water what doth hinder for me to be
[1:03:47] baptized you see as he began to expound
[1:03:48] unto him and he began to preach unto him
[1:03:51] Jesus he said there is a certain
[1:03:54] water now water in the
[1:03:58] desert makes you wonder if it was just a
[1:04:01] btle or what kind of water was it cuz
[1:04:04] there was just no name in the middle of
[1:04:05] a desert God provided for this unic
[1:04:07] exactly what he had need of and let me
[1:04:10] tell you in your desert Place God can
[1:04:12] provide the very thing that you have
[1:04:14] need
[1:04:16] of yes sir amen it can be an impossible
[1:04:22] situation but yet God could provide the
[1:04:24] very desires of your
[1:04:30] heart you see God provided the very
[1:04:33] thing that this man
[1:04:36] desired and God had an appointment with
[1:04:38] this
[1:04:39] man God had an appointment amen he said
[1:04:43] I'm going to send my servant Phillip to
[1:04:45] meet thee at this time and let me say
[1:04:48] something God always meets and makes his
[1:04:50] appointments yes amen no matter where
[1:04:53] you're at in life and how busy life is
[1:04:55] let me tell you something if you have an
[1:04:57] appointment with God God will meet you
[1:05:02] there that's right
[1:05:10] am you know I begin to think that
[1:05:14] God in his infancy he began to have
[1:05:17] these desires that he wanted to
[1:05:20] fulfill and God is so great that he
[1:05:22] began to come down and he you can never
[1:05:25] never put God into a box you can't put
[1:05:28] God into one object you can't say this
[1:05:31] is what God is because God is so great
[1:05:33] that whenever he came down and he
[1:05:35] created the heavens and the
[1:05:36] Earth so you see him in the heavens and
[1:05:39] you see him on Earth and you see him
[1:05:41] amongst the
[1:05:42] people there's no one attribute that
[1:05:45] defines who God is right there's not one
[1:05:48] attribute that you can say that's what
[1:05:50] God is because God is so different
[1:05:56] and yet God comes down and he might be
[1:06:00] watering the rock to some he might be
[1:06:04] Mana from Heaven to another he might
[1:06:06] walk on water to show the Miracles he
[1:06:09] might speak to the storm and the storm
[1:06:11] obeys him right but yet you see how God
[1:06:14] he's his desire is to express himself in
[1:06:17] so many different
[1:06:24] ways and he's here to fulfill the very
[1:06:27] desires of our
[1:06:30] hearts and if your desire is to have
[1:06:32] more of God there's more of God for you
[1:06:34] to receive for the Bible says with all
[1:06:37] thy getting get understanding get
[1:06:40] Revelation and there was a desire I came
[1:06:43] across this story of Elisha we all know
[1:06:45] it in 2 Kings 2 Elijah and Elisha and
[1:06:49] Elijah told Elisha to T here and they
[1:06:51] came to Bethel and he said I want you
[1:06:53] just to T here I'm going to go further
[1:06:56] right and he came to a place and he said
[1:06:58] no I want you to T here I'm going to go
[1:07:00] on but Elisha said I must go with
[1:07:03] you I must go on with you and they came
[1:07:07] to the place of Jericho and he said I
[1:07:09] want you to stay here I must go on but
[1:07:12] he says no I'm going to go with you why
[1:07:14] because there was the desire of Elisha
[1:07:16] there was something in Elisha that
[1:07:18] desired to have a double portion of what
[1:07:21] Elijah had yes sir amen that's right
[1:07:30] yep and as I begin to look into this
[1:07:32] story if Elisha would have listened to
[1:07:34] his prophet and carried and stopped when
[1:07:38] he told him he would have missed the
[1:07:40] double portion for
[1:07:42] him he would have missed the very the
[1:07:46] the portion that God had for him that
[1:07:48] double portion that he was going to pour
[1:07:50] out his spirit and give him a double
[1:07:52] portion he would have missed it if he
[1:07:54] would have listened to the prophet in
[1:07:56] stad
[1:07:58] amen and sometimes in our lives we must
[1:08:01] go on we must press on sometimes we
[1:08:04] don't understand why do I desire to do
[1:08:06] this or why do I hunger to do this or
[1:08:08] some you know ones have a burden to go
[1:08:10] onto the mission field or something in
[1:08:12] there is a
[1:08:14] burning but yet you must heed to that
[1:08:18] desire you must heed to that very
[1:08:21] warning that God has given
[1:08:23] you heed to that desire
[1:08:30] amen so we see that there was
[1:08:34] more that Elisha had to receive but he
[1:08:38] would have missed it if he didn't stay
[1:08:40] with the
[1:08:41] prophet God's provided place of worship
[1:08:44] he says we find that his successor was
[1:08:47] Elisha which is a type there of Christ
[1:08:51] in the church Elisha Elijah had done
[1:08:53] four Miracles and Elisha had done eight
[1:08:55] he had a double portion like was poured
[1:08:58] down upon the
[1:08:59] church so do you see the pattern yes
[1:09:03] that everything that God was he poured
[1:09:04] down into Christ and everything Christ
[1:09:07] was he poured down into the church
[1:09:09] amen amen prise the Lord and we know
[1:09:13] that this elishah anointing would H
[1:09:15] Elijah anointing would happen five times
[1:09:18] yes we know this Elijah Elisha John the
[1:09:22] Baptist then the prophet to the Gentiles
[1:09:25] than the Jews so we know that we've had
[1:09:28] an Elijah anointing in this hour amen
[1:09:31] we've had an
[1:09:32] anointing but yet there's also an Elisha
[1:09:35] anointing of a double portion being
[1:09:37] poured out because everything that God
[1:09:39] was he poured himself in
[1:09:46] yes let's read in Second
[1:09:51] Kings 2 Kings 2:8 and he says and Elijah
[1:09:54] took his man
[1:09:55] and wrapped it together and smoked the
[1:09:58] waters and they were divided thither
[1:10:01] hither and thither and so that they went
[1:10:04] to they went over on dry ground and it
[1:10:07] came to pass when they had gone over
[1:10:09] that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I
[1:10:12] shall do for thee before I am taken from
[1:10:15] thee and Elisha said I pray thee let
[1:10:18] Ador a portion of thy Spirit be upon me
[1:10:22] yeah that's it and he said thou H has
[1:10:24] asked a hard
[1:10:27] thing that ass a hard
[1:10:30] thing you know it's okay for you to ask
[1:10:33] hard
[1:10:36] things because we have a God that a
[1:10:39] answers hard questions amen had answers
[1:10:43] for all these desires that we have that
[1:10:46] we have but he says you have asked a
[1:10:49] hard
[1:10:52] thing but nevertheless
[1:10:55] nevertheless if thou see me when I am
[1:10:57] taken from thee it shall be unto thee
[1:11:01] but if not it shall not be so and we
[1:11:05] know the story that it goes on that a
[1:11:07] chariot would come
[1:11:09] down in a
[1:11:13] whirlwind and Elisha I'm sure he
[1:11:16] struggled that in this Whirlwind his
[1:11:18] wind is being blown around he's trying
[1:11:19] to watch because he knows that his
[1:11:21] double portion lays within watching
[1:11:23] Elisha Ascend into heaven
[1:11:26] and so I'm sure as he struggled and he
[1:11:28] he was blocking the dust and he's trying
[1:11:30] to make sure that he catches
[1:11:33] it and Elijah goes up and his mantle
[1:11:37] comes down and it falls upon the
[1:11:41] Earth and Elisha goes and he Rin His
[1:11:44] Garment what was he doing he was taking
[1:11:47] off the old
[1:11:49] garment and he was taking on a robe the
[1:11:53] prophet of God said he would begin he he
[1:11:55] would go over to the mantle and he would
[1:11:57] pick up his mantle and he'd pick it up
[1:11:59] and he put it on and he said it fit just
[1:12:03] right 42
[1:12:05] short and it fit just right what was he
[1:12:08] doing he was putting on the Garment he
[1:12:10] was putting on the double portion that
[1:12:12] was given unto
[1:12:14] him it was a sign unto him because he
[1:12:17] said if I Ascend you will see a you'll
[1:12:19] have a double portion yeah
[1:12:23] right but now
[1:12:27] we see that as that was taken on and he
[1:12:29] put on that garment what was it now he
[1:12:31] came to the River Jordan and as people
[1:12:33] looked across the river Jordan they
[1:12:36] would see this man and I'm sure it was
[1:12:38] far enough that they couldn't tell is
[1:12:39] that Elisha is that Elijah why is there
[1:12:42] only one of them right yeah but they're
[1:12:44] dressed like
[1:12:46] Elijah he's dressed he's got the robe of
[1:12:49] Elijah it must be
[1:12:53] Elijah but then whenever he smoked that
[1:12:55] he bound it up he bound up the mantle
[1:12:58] and he smoked the the River Jordan and
[1:13:00] it parted and he came through and the
[1:13:03] sons of the Prophet said does not the
[1:13:06] spirit of Elijah lay upon Elisha right
[1:13:10] right that same spirit that laid upon
[1:13:14] Elijah is now upon
[1:13:16] Elisha and it's no different today are
[1:13:19] you catching it it's no different today
[1:13:21] the same spirit that was Upon Our
[1:13:23] Prophet is now within the the Bride of
[1:13:25] her
[1:13:27] himself yes everything that God was he's
[1:13:30] pouring himself
[1:13:31] [Applause]
[1:13:34] down that's good there's no need to see
[1:13:37] what the prophet did what he did was
[1:13:39] great and it's wonderful and we can look
[1:13:41] and that's proof and that's works of
[1:13:42] what he's
[1:13:44] done yet how much more and how much
[1:13:47] greater are we Desiring more of God Are
[1:13:49] we hungering more of God do we want a
[1:13:52] double portion for our day
[1:13:56] amen
[1:14:02] Amen brother brandham says in the rising
[1:14:05] of the sun he says now then that fellow
[1:14:07] picked up that robe a type of the church
[1:14:10] again see he picked up that robe now he
[1:14:13] had done it twice the Miracles which is
[1:14:15] a type of Christ in the church Elijah
[1:14:17] had done four and he done eight see he
[1:14:21] was the he had he was double the power
[1:14:24] cuz he had ask for it sometimes all you
[1:14:27] got to do is ask Church all you got to
[1:14:30] do is ask amen why don't we have the
[1:14:32] things the very desires of our hearts
[1:14:34] cuz we're not asking we're too afraid
[1:14:36] Satan comes by and says well he can't do
[1:14:38] that or he can't fulfill that or your
[1:14:40] situation is too far gone let me tell
[1:14:42] you nothing is impossible for
[1:14:46] God no matter the
[1:14:49] situation no matter where we're at
[1:14:52] nothing is impossible for God
[1:15:00] and we understand that it's not some
[1:15:02] man's anointing that we're Desiring
[1:15:05] after it's not about a man right it's
[1:15:09] not to be like a man but it's the spirit
[1:15:13] of the man the god that dwells within
[1:15:15] that
[1:15:17] man the spirit be upon you I ask for a
[1:15:21] double portion
[1:15:23] of that the bride is dressing herself in
[1:15:26] the word and receiving the power making
[1:15:29] herself ready amen making herself ready
[1:15:32] what is it God just like in Luke 17:30
[1:15:35] what is it God revealing himself to his
[1:15:38] people God coming down making himself
[1:15:42] known the bride is dressing herself
[1:15:44] putting on the robe the
[1:15:47] Garment the Elijah of today is not is
[1:15:51] Jesus Christ himself
[1:15:56] sure it's God's Great desire to make
[1:15:59] himself
[1:16:06] known and if you keep reading in this
[1:16:11] chapter that Elijah had such an
[1:16:13] anointing and such a quickening
[1:16:16] power in his
[1:16:18] life that he would live to be 80 90
[1:16:21] years old or whatever it may be and he
[1:16:23] died
[1:16:25] and they put him into a tomb yeah the
[1:16:28] Bible says that there was some and there
[1:16:30] was thieves coming and so they threw a
[1:16:32] dead man's body in there to hide him and
[1:16:34] the man resurrected
[1:16:38] yep there was still such an anointing
[1:16:41] even when he was dead and gone that his
[1:16:43] bones carried a power that could Raise A
[1:16:46] Man from the
[1:16:48] dead what a power what anointing
[1:16:51] am that is that's Amen to bring a man
[1:16:56] back to life and that same quickening
[1:16:58] power is still alive today amen amen
[1:17:02] Ephesians 2 and one and you hath he
[1:17:04] Quicken who were dead in sin yes
[1:17:07] amen but God who is rich in Mercy for
[1:17:10] his great love wherewith he loved us
[1:17:12] even when we were dead in sin hath
[1:17:14] quickened us together with Christ and
[1:17:17] hath raised us up together and made us
[1:17:19] to sit in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:17:22] Jesus amen that is in the ages to come
[1:17:25] that he might show the exceeding Riches
[1:17:27] of his grace and his kindness toward us
[1:17:30] through Christ Jesus for by grace are
[1:17:34] you saved through
[1:17:38] faith and that not of yourselves but it
[1:17:41] is a gift of
[1:17:43] God not of
[1:17:45] Works lest a man should boast that's
[1:17:49] right not of works not of things that
[1:17:52] you could do you can't earn your way
[1:17:54] into into the kingdom of God
[1:17:58] am you
[1:18:01] can't you can't believe and be so
[1:18:03] self-righteous and come to church well I
[1:18:05] come to church and I serve God and I
[1:18:07] live this way and I do my due diligence
[1:18:09] and I and and I have a Bible study every
[1:18:12] morning and I and I do all these things
[1:18:15] th do as
[1:18:18] well but yet your Works identify the
[1:18:22] very faith that you have amen
[1:18:28] for we are his workmanship created in
[1:18:31] Christ Jesus unto good works yes which
[1:18:34] God hath before ordained that we should
[1:18:36] walk in
[1:18:39] them it's not of works alone lest any
[1:18:42] man should boast it's nothing within
[1:18:44] ourselves but it's only by the grace of
[1:18:46] almighty God
[1:18:48] Amen Saints it's only by the grace of
[1:18:52] God where go I
[1:18:56] even as the unic asked Philip how would
[1:18:58] I know unless the man show me right and
[1:19:01] expound and reveal unto me these things
[1:19:04] listen we're a privileged
[1:19:06] people we're a privileged people to know
[1:19:09] what you know to serve a God that you do
[1:19:11] to have a relationship with him am yes
[1:19:14] sir yes
[1:19:16] sir what a privileged people we are am
[1:19:19] we can never
[1:19:21] exhaust God's goodness toward us
[1:19:25] we can never exhaust or ask him too
[1:19:28] much and I think many times we live
[1:19:31] beneath our privileges amen because
[1:19:34] we're not asking enough we're not
[1:19:36] Desiring enough we're not hungering
[1:19:37] enough our Prophet said if the prophet
[1:19:39] of this day had to say he he had to be
[1:19:41] more sincere how much more should we be
[1:19:44] more sincere in our daily Walk With
[1:19:46] Jesus
[1:19:47] Christ that's true brother
[1:19:52] absolutely you see because sometimes our
[1:19:54] makeup
[1:19:56] whatever we're raised up in that's what
[1:19:57] we desire
[1:19:59] for we desire those things if you're
[1:20:02] constantly let me say this not all you
[1:20:05] know I grew up playing
[1:20:09] sports and it was something we were
[1:20:11] around and something we enjoyed and we
[1:20:12] just always did
[1:20:14] it but see that might not be a desire
[1:20:16] for some other kid that's unathletic and
[1:20:18] all these things
[1:20:20] right but yet it was something that we
[1:20:22] enjoyed and we had fun doing
[1:20:25] and it was a a desire that we had but
[1:20:28] yet it wasn't something that defined who
[1:20:30] we were
[1:20:32] right you understand the balance because
[1:20:36] if we take the preeminence away from
[1:20:38] those things or from church and in our
[1:20:41] Christian walk and
[1:20:43] things we got to be careful as parents
[1:20:46] that we don't instill a love for
[1:20:48] something that it goes way over way over
[1:20:51] and then there becomes an imbalance
[1:20:53] because once it gets out of balance
[1:20:54] bance to Bring It Back in Balance is a
[1:20:56] hard
[1:20:57] thing if I tried to take a bat away from
[1:21:00] my son right now it'd be a hard
[1:21:03] thing so that's the way we discipline
[1:21:05] him because he's hard-headed like me and
[1:21:08] he could take a spanking so we take away
[1:21:10] his Bat and he don't like
[1:21:12] that he learns real
[1:21:16] fast but you see we can never exhaust
[1:21:19] the blessings toward us or the the
[1:21:22] goodness of God toward us
[1:21:25] brother Brandon would use an example
[1:21:26] that he would say you know it would be
[1:21:29] un how did he put it something to do
[1:21:32] with a little fishing that if the fish
[1:21:34] said I better not drink too much and
[1:21:35] he's swimming in the ocean it don't even
[1:21:38] make
[1:21:39] sense you see sometimes in our mind we
[1:21:41] get so caught up and if this little fish
[1:21:43] said oh I I better not drink I better
[1:21:45] not eat too much but yet he lives in the
[1:21:47] ocean how vast and how great that ocean
[1:21:50] is it's no different for you and I
[1:22:01] in closing who desires are we fulfilling
[1:22:05] tonight have we been so caught up in the
[1:22:07] desires of the
[1:22:09] world so caught up with the cares of
[1:22:13] life that our spiritual life begins to
[1:22:16] sink down a little
[1:22:20] bit you know in studying this God just
[1:22:23] was dealing with me you know sermon like
[1:22:25] this it just puts us back in focus it
[1:22:28] puts us in remembrance of those things
[1:22:30] to make sure listen you know we can hear
[1:22:32] the services and and we've heard them
[1:22:35] over our special meetings and your name
[1:22:37] is written in the book and and I believe
[1:22:39] that and I love that and there's
[1:22:40] something to it and it does something
[1:22:42] for me but what these services do is it
[1:22:45] checks to make sure that that my life is
[1:22:47] lining up with that name that's
[1:22:51] written to making sure that we're on
[1:22:53] track
[1:22:55] [Music]
[1:22:57] amen because many of us and I don't want
[1:23:00] to say us in general but I'm just saying
[1:23:02] as a whole what can happen
[1:23:05] is is we get so worked up in our faith
[1:23:07] and our if you believe faith and I
[1:23:09] believe God and predestination and
[1:23:11] Hallelujah which is all
[1:23:13] true but you better show me your Works
[1:23:16] your life better line up with the word
[1:23:18] amen your life better go through the
[1:23:20] filter of the
[1:23:22] word amen
[1:23:25] that's
[1:23:26] good I will show thee my faith by my
[1:23:29] Works musicians
[1:23:33] come you know and I'll never
[1:23:36] forget as good as services and special
[1:23:39] meetings there was something that
[1:23:40] brother Eugene said he says if you
[1:23:44] want if you want a a different result
[1:23:47] make a greater sacrifice
[1:23:51] yeah make a greater
[1:23:55] sacrifice sacrifices are
[1:23:57] hard that means you have to give up
[1:23:59] something amen you have to put time into
[1:24:02] something yes amen because it would be
[1:24:05] too easy
[1:24:07] sometimes I was talking with brother
[1:24:09] Matt and he said you know I wanted to
[1:24:11] read my Bible every day and I read it
[1:24:13] and it didn't fulfill
[1:24:16] anything like your life didn't
[1:24:20] change like it didn't do anything it
[1:24:22] didn't fulfill that desire I thought I
[1:24:23] would become Invincible I thought it
[1:24:25] might change doing something but it
[1:24:28] didn't do anything but yet it's a
[1:24:30] priority it's something we must do
[1:24:39] yeah if we want a different result make
[1:24:42] a greater
[1:24:43] [Music]
[1:24:46] sacrifice that puts the ball in our
[1:24:49] [Music]
[1:24:51] court it puts the ball in our court
[1:24:57] because many times we try to work our
[1:24:59] way into heaven we try to do this or
[1:25:01] that or maybe if you show up to church
[1:25:03] on this time and you do all these
[1:25:04] different things and show up to every
[1:25:05] youth meeting and be at church every
[1:25:08] service which is all
[1:25:11] good but it's works that we're
[1:25:13] Desiring works that we can put something
[1:25:17] to but a greater sacrifice is what we
[1:25:23] need let's stand to our
[1:25:30] [Music]
[1:25:34] feet let's just bow our
[1:25:42] heads Lord we want to say we love you
[1:25:45] yes

[1:26:34] gotten a little
[1:26:36] dry I don't
[1:26:40] [Music]
[1:26:43] know but father you spoke to me and you
[1:26:45] said a desire gives me an opportunity to
[1:26:48] move in their life

[1:27:02] at and father
[1:27:10] I Lord sometimes I don't
[1:27:14] understand the things you put on our
[1:27:16] heart but God I I pray that it would
[1:27:18] fall into good
[1:27:20] ground that they would take it and apply
[1:27:23] it in our lives

[1:27:27] even tonight Lord let our desires look
[1:27:30] upon you let our
[1:27:32] desires father we understand that we
[1:27:34] must fulfill certain things in
[1:27:37] life and cares of life but Lord may we
[1:27:41] take them always through our desires
