[12:26] Lord knows what that need is if you have
[12:27] a need this morning if you just want to
[12:28] lift that before the Lord let's sing the
[12:30] chorus one more time as brother Steven
[12:31] McNeely would come take us to the Lord
[12:34] in prayer there's a
[12:37] found open in the House of

[12:59] C
[13:01] come now and
[13:08] reive let's just bow our heads Heavenly
[13:12] Father Lord what an honor and a
[13:15] privilege it is to be in your house and
[13:18] Lord where you are there is
[13:22] Liberty there is Lord Freedom there is
[13:25] healing there is virtues there is life
[13:28] Lord and so we're asking this morning
[13:32] for Life father and for that life
[13:35] abundantly like your word says we heard
[13:38] the testimony this morning here of the
[13:41] healing of cancer Lord your Prophet said
[13:44] that if the people would believe that
[13:46] not even cancer would stand in their
[13:49] ways and so we're asking Lord May our
[13:52] faith arise may you help us Lord in our
[13:55] unbelief that we might believe that all
[13:57] things are possible for they are to
[13:59] those who would believe we pray for the
[14:01] needs that's within our body Lord many
[14:04] are sickly many are at home not feeling
[14:06] good Lord and father God you know each
[14:09] and every one we're asking now that you
[14:11] would meet it according to your word
[14:13] Lord father we have joined ourselves
[14:16] together and come here Lord that we
[14:17] might hear of you and so we're asking
[14:20] that your word would come forth and that
[14:22] it would uh fulfill its intent and
[14:25] purpose in our lives Lord may you bring
[14:27] us up a little high higher father than
[14:30] what we were when we came bless your
[14:32] people we pray be with our pastor Lord

[14:37] mind father may your angels Lord

[14:44] you Lord just send the the angel with
[14:47] the softest hands Lord may you rub his
[14:51] brow Lord may you comfort him father and
[14:54] father raise him up and restore onto his
[14:57] health we're ask asking these things for
[14:59] thy Kingdom's Glory now in the name of
[15:02] Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you
[15:05] you may be seated this
[15:10] morning certainly glad to be
[15:12] home and um I was just thinking on my
[15:15] way to church there this morning it's
[15:17] been since the middle of November I
[15:19] guess since the last time I was in
[15:22] church I almost feel like a backslider
[15:24] here at home and uh just to give a
[15:27] little update on our our trip we're
[15:30] we're all almost home uh brother Amos is
[15:33] in LAX right now he went to uh New
[15:37] Zealand to visit brother Chris mther and
[15:39] Cher there for a little bit and so he's
[15:42] on his way home he's had a couple of
[15:43] delayed flights and um the brother Gabe
[15:47] Harris he was in um Australia visiting
[15:52] his sister and stuff but his grandma
[15:55] passed away and so he had to cut his
[15:57] trip short
[15:59] and he flew to Texas for his grandma's
[16:02] funeral and stuff there so just keep
[16:04] them in your prayers um the rest of us
[16:07] were all home but as you can tell uh
[16:11] we're a little under the weather and so
[16:14] I guess it's just all part of it isn't
[16:16] it and um we had a really good Services
[16:20] over there in
[16:21] vatu uh we had nine Services total I
[16:25] believe it was and uh the Lord just did
[16:28] Mighty things and um Saturday morning
[16:32] brother James preached and brother Ron
[16:35] told him cast The Net James cast The Net
[16:38] so we cast the net and all of a sudden
[16:41] one person came forward and you can tell
[16:43] this gentleman was uh extremely broken
[16:47] in his Spirit just before the Lord and
[16:50] another one came forward and another one
[16:53] came forward and brother Ron made a a
[16:56] little bit more of a call from behind
[16:57] the pulpit and next thing we know we're
[17:00] having a prayer line and man every
[17:03] single man woman boy and girl whoever
[17:07] could walk was going through that prayer
[17:09] line and uh I think we prayed for over
[17:12] 400 people on Friday morning on uh yeah
[17:17] I think it was Friday Saturday morning
[17:18] there and the Lord just moved in a very
[17:21] special way and um out of the people
[17:24] that came forward there was 12 that gave
[17:27] their lives to Jesus Christ
[17:29] got baptized and uh and that's what it's
[17:32] all about yeah give the Lord a hand clap
[17:34] of
[17:40] Praise yeah so brother James he got to
[17:43] do his first baptisms and stuff there on
[17:46] the ocean it was just so it was just
[17:48] beautiful a very beautiful scene and um
[17:51] and so as you all know uh brother Ron
[17:54] got sick over there and um you know he
[17:58] said as they were coming through the
[17:59] prayer lines little kids you put your
[18:01] hand up their heads and they're just
[18:04] burning up with fever just burning up
[18:07] and um pretty much right after the
[18:10] service he lost his voice and so he was
[18:13] only able to preach one service over
[18:15] there really and um and so as the days
[18:19] went on you know his condition got a
[18:21] little bit worse and a little bit worse
[18:23] as it does and and brother Jerry you
[18:26] know is brother Jerry here this morning
[18:28] I don't think he is is he he shouldn't
[18:30] be
[18:32] anyways probably the second day we were
[18:35] there brother Jerry got sick and and um
[18:38] he did everything he could just to make
[18:40] it home and and so we're trusting for
[18:43] the Lord to really touch brother Jerry
[18:45] this morning also um but brother Ron
[18:48] came home uh real deep chesty cough and
[18:53] um you know he suffered it for two days
[18:55] you know how brother Ron is he's he he's
[18:57] a bu old dog he'll suffer through these
[18:59] things but early Friday morning sister
[19:02] Sandy took him into the hospital and um
[19:05] sure enough you know he he had pneumonia
[19:08] influenza uh dehydrated you know all of
[19:12] the above and so they're keeping them in
[19:14] there three or 4 days to get them
[19:17] rehydrated and get the pneumonia taken
[19:20] care of and different things he wanted
[19:22] to preach this
[19:24] morning we were on our way home I was
[19:27] flying with brother J and brother Ron I
[19:29] said brother Jerry brother Ron I'm
[19:31] already scheduled for Wednesday night
[19:33] just trade me Services I'll take Sunday
[19:36] you take Wednesday and he said ah we'll
[19:41] see and it's because of his love for the
[19:45] Sheep but our love for brother Ron is
[19:48] brother Ron get
[19:49] healthy it's okay so brother Ron we know
[19:52] you're watching please get healthy amen
[19:56] and so he's in the right right place
[19:58] right now he's getting hydrated he's
[20:01] getting the care that he needs and the
[20:02] Lord willing here within the next one or
[20:05] two days he'll be out of the hospital
[20:07] and uh back on his feet again so we just
[20:10] want to and I just want to say um you
[20:13] know let's try not to bombard brother
[20:15] Ron with text messages and asking him
[20:18] questions and stuff let's just give him
[20:20] this time to relax give him this time to
[20:23] recover and not have to worry about
[20:26] answering questions and things if if you

[20:46] okay praise the Lord so we have brother
[20:49] Paul halet here this morning he's going
[20:51] to preach with us and I was just so so
[20:53] thankful uh that he is in town because

[39:27] over and over and over again but the
[39:30] other day other evening we were visiting

[39:58] Mary's mama I thought what did Brother
[40:00] brandham say about Mary's mama and I
[40:02] could only find one place where brother
[40:04] brandom talked about her and maybe
[40:05] there's other places that he did but I I
[40:07] found one place and he called her
[40:10] Anna and it was in a message called
[40:12] Mary's belief preached right here in
[40:13] Phoenix in
[40:15] 1960 and the little portion of that
[40:18] drama that he is telling he says and
[40:21] Anna he talks about Joseph how perfect
[40:24] Joseph was in his thinking and his way
[40:26] doing thing he said he said Joseph and
[40:28] Mary were his spouse and they were
[40:29] sitting on the porch of Anna's home and
[40:32] they were looking across the street
[40:33] where Joseph was building a house for
[40:34] him and Mary to dwell and and the
[40:36] carpenter shop in the back and he said
[40:38] how everything was perfect in Joseph's
[40:40] mind he wanted everything to be just
[40:41] right he said a little heart carved in
[40:44] the gate he said just to represent the
[40:46] love that he had for Mary and and he
[40:48] goes on he said but then he said as
[40:51] Joseph and Mary were fellowshipping
[40:52] there on the porch he said Anna come out
[40:54] the door and handed Joseph the the book
[40:56] of
[40:57] Isaiah brother brandom says and he said
[41:00] Joseph unrolls the scroll and he begin
[41:02] to
[41:03] read where a virgin shall
[41:07] [Music]
[41:12] conceive Anna did you
[41:16] know I just haven't been able to get
[41:18] away from that I'm like you know there
[41:19] was no angel no Gabriel come to
[41:23] her but yet she believed God word and

[48:33] heart I almost feel this morning that
[48:36] other when we know that our purpose to
[48:38] be here is for the preaching of the word
[48:40] but I almost feel like the atmosphere
[48:43] that's here the songs that have been
[48:44] sung we could almost just say amen and
[48:48] go home amen I was thinking as our
[48:51] sisters were
[48:52] singing you know the beauty of how it
[48:56] comes down in the word of God Satan
[48:59] sewing his seeds of doubt and fear and
[49:01] anxieties do I have the Holy Ghost am I
[49:05] saved this that and the other that he
[49:07] throws and I love
[49:09] how God uses a prophet's voice to settle
[49:12] or calb the water of our life and he
[49:16] says you know you can't be deceived
[49:19] that's right because you are the
[49:24] word aren't you thankful God would come
[49:27] and let his word be born in the manger
[49:30] of our hearts amen that it would come so
[49:34] strongly and anchor Us in this day amen
[49:38] we could look back I remember a brother
[49:40] one time telling me Oh he I would just
[49:43] have loved I would have loved to lived
[49:45] and he named an age in the church ages
[49:47] he said I would have loved to have lived
[49:49] in that
[49:51] age and then he
[49:53] paused and he said well well not as much
[49:56] as I love to live in this
[49:58] age we live in Leo
[50:00] deia the devil he Sly isn't
[50:04] he but we've already won the victory

[50:33] very feel a privileged to be here this
[50:35] morning but I'll be honest with you I I
[50:37] was in great anticipation of hearing
[50:39] brother Ron share about the trip to Batu
[50:43] and all that God would do there you know
[50:45] if you've followed that through the
[50:46] years and you have you're you're the
[50:49] church here God always does something
[50:51] Supernatural when brother Ron goes to
[50:53] vanatu there's always something in
[50:55] incredible that happens and and I'm here
[50:57] by forfeit brother Ron can't preach this
[51:00] morning brother Steven's not feeling
[51:01] well so I am your
[51:04] substitute and you know how substitute
[51:06] teachers are you tolerate them but you
[51:08] never fully embrace them but this
[51:11] morning I I just trust that you won't
[51:13] listen to brother Paul you'll just
[51:14] listen to the word of God and I trust
[51:17] it's been my heart I've prayed over this
[51:19] and I don't know why I feel nervous this
[51:21] morning sister Jerry's always saying
[51:24] well I know when you're nervous and I'm
[51:26] like how do you know and your voice
[51:28] squeaks and um so I hope you don't hear
[51:31] Too Much squeaking this morning amen
[51:33] let's turn in our Bibles this morning
[51:36] Amen to First Corinthians I want to
[51:39] speak to
[51:40] you on God's power to perfect amen and
[51:46] we look at this and realize if we don't
[51:49] have a security we don't have peace then
[51:52] as we'll read through the word of God
[51:54] we'll find ourselves at odds we'll say
[51:57] well I I I don't feel like I reached
[52:00] this or I've attained to this place but
[52:03] yet we'll come to another passage of
[52:05] scripture we'll come to another time
[52:07] that the prophet speaks and we have with
[52:10] an absolute certainty in our hearts we
[52:12] are Sons and Daughters of God filled
[52:14] with the Holy Ghost amen with the power
[52:17] to overcome this world now it all comes
[52:19] down to what voice you listen to the one
[52:21] that's inside this skull here or the
[52:24] word of God Amen and we listen to oursel
[52:27] my brother and sister and it never
[52:29] causes it always causes you to to have a
[52:32] problem I'm just going to throw my
[52:34] little niece Beth Beth under the bus you
[52:36] know she had just been down to Idaho to
[52:39] visit us and they had quite a bit of
[52:40] snow fall in Alaska and the snow falling
[52:43] off the roof and she I guess it's a
[52:45] family tradition and and you can judge
[52:47] whether that's a good tradition or not
[52:49] but she climbed up on the front porch
[52:51] rail which is quite high and leaped off
[52:54] into the snow I've done this since I was
[52:56] a little kid only this time it breaks
[52:58] her
[53:01] back sometimes that voice in your head
[53:03] shouldn't be listened
[53:05] to you shouldn't get up there and say
[53:08] you know I've always done
[53:12] this it'll work out just
[53:15] fine the Lord
[53:17] knows listen to the word not the voice
[53:21] in your head
[53:23] amen hallelujah let's just turn to 1
[53:26] Corinthians the 2 chapter verses 1-6 but
[53:30] we'll read down a bit here and um uh
[53:35] verse 6 and let you be seated this
[53:37] morning amen God's power to
[53:41] perfect and I Brethren when I come to
[53:43] you come not with Excellency of speech
[53:47] or of wisdom declaring unto you the
[53:50] testimony of God for I determine not to
[53:52] know anything among you save Jesus
[53:55] Christ can we say Amen to that amen
[53:57] that's what we want amen and him
[54:00] crucified and I was with you in weakness
[54:02] and in fear and in much trembling and my
[54:06] speech and my preaching was not with
[54:09] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[54:11] demonstration of the spirit and of power
[54:14] amen that your faith should not stand in
[54:17] the wisdom of man but in the power of
[54:20] God how be it we speak wisdom among them
[54:24] that are
[54:28] perfect you realize if we don't
[54:32] recognize our correct
[54:37] position you are
[54:39] perfect otherwise there's no wisdom in
[54:42] us at
[54:44] all we cannot manufacture
[54:49] wisdom but God says I'm going to
[54:54] speak H wisdom among them that are
[54:58] perfect Saints there's wisdom in the
[55:00] house
[55:01] today amen can we acknowledge that let's
[55:05] let's lift our voices real loud thank
[55:07] you Lord You Lord there's wisdom in the
[55:09] house
[55:10] today amen yet not the wisdom of this
[55:14] world nor of the princes of this world
[55:16] that come to not but we speak the wisdom
[55:19] of God in a mystery yeah even the hidden
[55:24] wisdom which God ordained before the
[55:26] world and to our Glory Heavenly Father
[55:29] we thank you today just ask for your
[55:31] guiding hand Lord speak the word father
[55:35] Lord that it would be of benefit Lord a
[55:38] blessing to your people I pray in the
[55:40] name of Jesus Christ amen am you may be
[55:45] seated goes on to say in verse
[55:48] 7 but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[55:51] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[55:54] ordained before the world and to our
[55:55] Glory so this is declaring this mystery
[55:59] is going to be revealed in our day amen
[56:03] isn't this wonderful we're no longer
[56:05] going to just look out there and see a
[56:07] mystery you'll see my brother and sister
[56:09] many ministers around the world in
[56:11] denomination Etc preaching of the
[56:13] Mysteries and and it draws us we receive
[56:16] a postcard once a year of a local church
[56:19] that has a mystery seminar and and
[56:22] they're there and and uh they're they're
[56:24] telling you that they are going to
[56:26] unfold the Mysteries well my brother and
[56:29] sister they're still speaking the same
[56:32] thing they started 10 years ago when
[56:34] they were going to reveal the mystery so
[56:37] either they already had the revelation
[56:39] of the mystery or they're still
[56:41] searching for it amen so as you look
[56:44] here now he says now none of the princes
[56:46] of this world knew for had they known it
[56:49] they would not have crucified the Lord
[56:51] Of Glory but as it is written I hath not
[56:54] Seen Nor Ear heard neither had enter
[56:57] into the heart of man the things which
[57:00] God hath prepared for them that love him
[57:03] there's a lot of preparation been put
[57:05] into you Saints amen God has done a lot
[57:09] of preparation to reveal these things to
[57:13] you amen so it's there we look and see
[57:17] that it it's a what man would even know
[57:21] he has the spirit of man right which is
[57:23] in him even so the things of God knoweth
[57:25] no man but the spirit of God for now we
[57:28] have received not the spirit of the
[57:29] world but the spirit which is of God Can
[57:31] someone say Amen that we might know the
[57:35] things that are freely given to us of
[57:37] God so we have a gift that has been
[57:39] given which things also we speak not in
[57:42] The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but
[57:44] which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing
[57:47] spiritual things with spiritual but the
[57:51] natural man receiveth not the things of
[57:53] the spirit of God for they are
[57:55] foolishness unto him and I'm going to
[57:58] just say something that might come
[57:59] across a little
[58:01] harsh and we'll tie together a little
[58:04] farther in the service my brother and
[58:05] sister when the word's revealed and you
[58:07] know this is a revealed word and you
[58:09] don't value it enough to act upon
[58:12] it on huh the word says that's
[58:17] iniquity now Les we get too concerned
[58:19] here today that iniquity this horrible
[58:22] thing Lord I'm falling apart I want to
[58:24] just throw this out so you'll be
[58:26] prepared for later my brother and sister
[58:28] every one of us this morning sitting in
[58:31] this building has a degree of iniquity
[58:34] in our life can someone agree with me
[58:37] there's many things we know to do that
[58:41] we do not
[58:45] do it's almost painful when you think
[58:48] about that Lord I I'm standing here
[58:50] speaking to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[58:52] with iniquity in my life yeah
[58:57] ouch you know that's what you say when
[58:59] it's painful not all the rest of those
[59:01] words
[59:02] ouch but you see God by his grace my
[59:05] brother and sister is working on our
[59:10] iniquity amen we're not leaving it to
[59:13] tend to itself but we have submitted it
[59:16] committed it to God and he is moving on
[59:20] our behalf but you got to remember we're
[59:23] not looking for man's Perfection we're
[59:25] looking for God's Perfection amen so you
[59:29] must do all things by the spirit because
[59:33] if you don't and look at the carnal man
[59:36] the carnal man will walk out of these
[59:38] doors today and never come back because
[59:41] you would say I don't measure up and I
[59:45] can't but if you look at the Spirit then
[59:48] it's not you that was drawn back to the
[59:51] house of God it was God drawing you
[59:55] amen we're here this morning because God
[59:57] loves you so much to draw you back to
[1:00:02] himself
[1:00:06] Amen Let me just jump to verse
[1:00:09] 16 for Heath known the mind but who
[1:00:12] known the mind of God that he may
[1:00:15] instruct him but we have the mind of
[1:00:17] Christ amen I would just encourage you
[1:00:19] right now just in your heart to say amen
[1:00:22] I have the mind of Christ amen if we
[1:00:25] have any other mind my brother and
[1:00:26] sister we're we're going to get confused
[1:00:29] amen I hope y'all don't mind I was
[1:00:30] raised on the farm my dad knew that boys
[1:00:33] that were too warm in the winter were
[1:00:34] lazy boys and my dad used to make us
[1:00:37] take our cat off cuz he says you can't
[1:00:40] work with a code on so I've carried that
[1:00:42] all through my life so I know that some
[1:00:44] of the brothers here can preach a whole
[1:00:46] inspired anointed Service never unbutton
[1:00:48] their jacket I don't know how they do it
[1:00:51] so if yall don't mind I'll just take my
[1:00:53] coat off so I can get down and work amen
[1:00:56] thank you brother Mark Hallelujah now
[1:00:59] I'm always amazed my brother and sister
[1:01:01] we have all kinds of critics in the
[1:01:03] world today and they're out here voicing
[1:01:05] their ideas of the message and their
[1:01:07] ideas of God but I always find it very
[1:01:09] interesting that people who can't even
[1:01:11] explain themselves are explaining God
[1:01:14] Amen well God surely meant this and God
[1:01:16] surely meant that well go ahead and tell
[1:01:18] me what is it that you are and where are
[1:01:20] you're standing and why you are where
[1:01:22] you are because after all you are the
[1:01:24] king of your
[1:01:26] domain and if you really have such a
[1:01:28] grasp of who you are then maybe you can
[1:01:31] move towards even trying to explain God
[1:01:33] but my brother and sister it's not our
[1:01:35] calling to explain God it's our calling
[1:01:38] to listen to the word of God and act on
[1:01:40] the word of God and then put the word of
[1:01:42] God on display amen many times people
[1:01:45] say well brother Paul I I need how can I
[1:01:48] defend the message I I have a coworker I
[1:01:50] have a friend I have this my brother and
[1:01:52] sister the prophet of God didn't say
[1:01:54] you're not not here to defend this
[1:01:55] message you're here to live it amen and
[1:01:58] your life will defend the message amen I
[1:02:02] say and this is something I've held for
[1:02:04] for many many years my brother and
[1:02:06] sister when brother Brandon was there
[1:02:08] Discerning hearts in the prayer lines
[1:02:11] and praying for people and people being
[1:02:13] healed and all of that and we'll look at
[1:02:15] that and we say there's a Vindication of
[1:02:17] this ministry prophecy being fulfilled
[1:02:20] and I don't want to be an anti but my
[1:02:21] brother and sister like I said I'm just
[1:02:23] a tad bit War
[1:02:24] but I look at this and I look at that
[1:02:26] and say you know what there are men in
[1:02:28] those days right we all know the story
[1:02:31] of how brother brandham brought that out
[1:02:32] in the public brother the God didn't
[1:02:34] want him to but brother brandom you know
[1:02:36] having compassion for the people and he
[1:02:39] lays that out and they are there but I'm
[1:02:41] telling you there's men who prayed for
[1:02:42] the sick and they were healed there were
[1:02:44] men who discerned hearts and that was
[1:02:47] correct there was Men Who prophesied and
[1:02:49] it came to pass but I tell you I believe
[1:02:52] all that don't misunderstand me I
[1:02:53] believe that but I tell you what I
[1:02:55] personally believe is the greater
[1:02:57] Vindication of the prophet's message is
[1:03:00] that he spoke of a people who would have
[1:03:02] been restored back to the word of people
[1:03:05] who had come and had received the
[1:03:07] father's message and they had received
[1:03:09] the Holy goals and they are sitting here
[1:03:12] this morning here is the Vindication
[1:03:16] that matters in leoda it's not what
[1:03:18] happened in
[1:03:19] 1955 1960
[1:03:22] 1965 but what's happening in 2023 and we
[1:03:26] are coming even to the end of this this
[1:03:28] year here's a
[1:03:31] Vindication now I know the devil never
[1:03:33] bothers
[1:03:35] you he never torments you he never
[1:03:38] throws Temptation or trials in your
[1:03:42] way that's right brother every single
[1:03:51] day why are you here yeah come
[1:03:55] on something keeps holding
[1:03:59] me every day you
[1:04:03] see
[1:04:05] Hallelujah my brother and sister you
[1:04:08] see God's got a power one thing I can
[1:04:12] say about hope y'all don't mind they
[1:04:13] take a drink I never do it the pulpit
[1:04:15] but you guys are dry down
[1:04:18] here I'm not talking about you
[1:04:20] spiritually
[1:04:22] church I'm talking about your your your
[1:04:24] Atmos no not even your
[1:04:26] atmosphere amen excuse
[1:04:37] me now we look here the Apostle Paul
[1:04:41] laying a very solid foundation for us
[1:04:43] can we say thank you Lord for the
[1:04:44] Apostle Paul amen that Foundation was so
[1:04:48] solid that even the prophet went back to
[1:04:50] that foundation and built as it were
[1:04:53] upon that brought Revelation to us now
[1:04:55] in the sermon the message Perfection
[1:04:58] 1957 brother brandham then speaks he
[1:05:01] says now God in the beginning required
[1:05:06] Perfection Jesus when he come up to
[1:05:09] Earth he said be perfect like God in
[1:05:11] heaven is perfect and the law having a
[1:05:14] shadow of things to come could never
[1:05:16] make the worshipper perfect you get the
[1:05:18] picture now let's go it again so you'll
[1:05:21] be sure not to miss it amen so that
[1:05:24] means somebody was probably going to
[1:05:26] miss it if the prophet didn't clarify
[1:05:27] that God requires perfect Holiness no
[1:05:31] one can stand in His image with one
[1:05:34] little speck of sin my brother and
[1:05:36] sister if you don't have a deeper
[1:05:38] Revelation then we should just get up
[1:05:39] and leave right cuz didn't we just
[1:05:42] pretty much all of us acknowledge we
[1:05:43] have some iniquity in our life and
[1:05:45] iniquity is sin now iniquity doesn't
[1:05:48] mean that it's something wicked or evil
[1:05:50] or something to be despised or uh looked
[1:05:52] down upon it can be be as simple I like
[1:05:54] to use this analogy CU it doesn't
[1:05:56] doesn't hurt anybody's feelings it could
[1:05:59] be just that we know we should take the
[1:06:00] trash out and we refuse to do
[1:06:03] it oh I was talking in your own
[1:06:10] life
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:14] out come on Saints
[1:06:16] [Applause]
[1:06:18] out instead we could have some
[1:06:21] self-imposed law sisters come I've got a
[1:06:23] tape measure here in my pocket we're
[1:06:26] going to ma your shoes
[1:06:27] today that's nonsense isn't it we should
[1:06:31] be Beyond such things right we should be
[1:06:34] becoming mature into a perfect image of
[1:06:37] a bride of Christ not going back into
[1:06:40] legalistic or not being messaged
[1:06:42] churches that are now almost turning to
[1:06:45] the symbolism of Judaism to to maintain
[1:06:48] or present something I'm not against
[1:06:50] those things went to Israel this last
[1:06:52] year had a wonderful time but my brother
[1:06:54] and sister you see we're not called to
[1:06:56] go back we're called to go forward Amen
[1:07:00] to come into this Perfection of Jesus
[1:07:02] Christ by the preaching of the word amen
[1:07:07] so this perfecting amen God required
[1:07:09] Perfection and so if he requires perfect
[1:07:12] Holiness no one can stand in His image
[1:07:15] with one little speck of sin Jesus
[1:07:18] witnessed the same and said be perfect
[1:07:20] just like God in heaven is perfect and
[1:07:22] the Bible said that the law could never
[1:07:26] Oh you mean if we apply
[1:07:28] law
[1:07:30] Saints this is
[1:07:32] why those of you that know me well know
[1:07:34] my
[1:07:35] testimony go back a lot of
[1:07:39] years about 19 years old my first maybe
[1:07:44] 18 years old my first interactions with
[1:07:45] brother
[1:07:48] Ron there'd be some here brother Mike
[1:07:52] would be well beyond those years 40 some
[1:07:57] years ago but not boasting but I would
[1:08:00] say there's many of you wouldn't have
[1:08:02] known brother Ron 40 some years
[1:08:05] ago brother Ron's the same man today as
[1:08:07] he was then and he was the same man then
[1:08:09] as he is now a man who has striven his
[1:08:12] whole life to be balanced that's in
[1:08:15] character in
[1:08:16] nature oh I just CAU A vibe from the
[1:08:18] congregation yes he makes
[1:08:21] mistakes it's not making the mistake
[1:08:24] it's what you do once you have made the
[1:08:29] mistake run from God or run to him
[1:08:32] there's our choice I can stand here and
[1:08:34] feel fully qualified to those of you
[1:08:36] might be offended if I say about running
[1:08:38] from God CU at 15 I
[1:08:42] ran I become a
[1:08:45] runner but by God's grace and amazing we
[1:08:49] run big circles that's right cuz if
[1:08:51] you're the bride of Christ you can't get
[1:08:53] away
[1:08:54] you'll run run run run run run run run
[1:08:57] run and yes it even fits that song run
[1:09:00] with the message of Malachi 4 it never
[1:09:03] left me and I ran and I ran and I ran
[1:09:06] until I was too tired to run any further
[1:09:08] and finally I had to say Lord forgive me
[1:09:10] but you see a balanced
[1:09:12] message is an absolute prerequisite for
[1:09:16] rapturing
[1:09:17] faith we lean too far to the left lean
[1:09:20] too far to the right amen we'll be
[1:09:22] trusting in things or trusting in
[1:09:26] nothing so we have to have a balanced
[1:09:28] message and this balanced message will
[1:09:30] bring us to a place that the word of God
[1:09:32] then makes very clear sense to
[1:09:36] us it no longer be so and so said it
[1:09:40] will be God said you love your pastor
[1:09:43] but you see God in your pastor and it's
[1:09:46] God that we follow right amen so we look
[1:09:51] at this that the law could never with it
[1:09:53] sacrifice es make the com perfect then
[1:09:55] the law could not perfect anything it
[1:10:00] was only a
[1:10:02] pointer these sacrifices made every year
[1:10:05] could never make the worshipper perfect
[1:10:07] so therefore no one under the law or
[1:10:09] keeping of laws or under the shadows
[1:10:13] could be
[1:10:16] perfect pretty cut and dried isn't it
[1:10:20] pretty
[1:10:21] straightforward I think today we could
[1:10:24] lift a hand and say thank you Lord for
[1:10:27] there go I but the grace of
[1:10:33] God true now do you guys believe in
[1:10:37] homework my dear little sister you go to
[1:10:40] public school or home school or are you
[1:10:42] older than you
[1:10:45] look you see homework is just a part of
[1:10:50] life as kids we're like they gave us
[1:10:53] homework again again they don't like us
[1:10:55] my parents made me do the homework no
[1:10:56] one loves
[1:10:58] me but do you realize God requires
[1:11:00] homework yeah it's not what we do at
[1:11:03] church that matters my brother and
[1:11:04] sister it's what we do at home there's
[1:11:07] our homework and we have been given
[1:11:09] homework every single day so I'm just
[1:11:12] going to be totally presumptuous today
[1:11:13] if you don't mind cuz I will whether you
[1:11:15] mind or not but anyway I would encourage
[1:11:18] each one of you to go home and read 2
[1:11:20] Corinthians 13 amen you know in this
[1:11:24] we'll look at this very strong words I
[1:11:26] think it's verse five or six very strong
[1:11:28] words know
[1:11:30] yourself don't sit here just I go to
[1:11:33] church I believe the message I was
[1:11:35] raised in the message so was I didn't do
[1:11:37] me a bit of good until I was in my
[1:11:40] 30s but you see we need to do our
[1:11:43] homework and we need to know ourself
[1:11:47] very good and if you find iniquity now
[1:11:50] my sermon is not about iniquity but if
[1:11:52] you find iniquity in there don't bury it
[1:11:55] expose it bring it to the surface and
[1:11:58] say Lord I need this out of my life amen
[1:12:02] you know I I used to as a young man have
[1:12:04] a very extensive collection of of VHS uh
[1:12:08] not VHS I mean um eight track um
[1:12:12] yes
[1:12:15] anyway I'm getting old sister Jerry
[1:12:18] brought up a word that should never be
[1:12:20] brought up in the presence of her
[1:12:21] husband and she said something about
[1:12:27] scile but you see if you don't know
[1:12:31] yourself then what is this word going to
[1:12:34] do for you you have to stop even as we
[1:12:37] take communion the scripture in
[1:12:39] Corinthians says examine yourself oh
[1:12:42] Lord let me be honest enough with myself
[1:12:45] today to look at my own life and say
[1:12:48] Lord I have shortcoming I have weakness
[1:12:50] here but here I believe with all of my
[1:12:52] heart and and oh Lord here I feel like
[1:12:55] I'm on on kind of equal footing on good
[1:12:58] footing but over here Lord I have I have
[1:13:00] a trouble with this am all right now I
[1:13:04] hate to even bring these things up but I
[1:13:05] want to drive the point home my brother
[1:13:07] and sister there'll be even many a young
[1:13:08] person or maybe old person in the
[1:13:11] assembly today there's a problem with
[1:13:15] music when I was a kid I had extensive
[1:13:18] collection of that I had a a a Pioneer
[1:13:21] High power the modern day Bo boom
[1:13:26] bo and I I hid it under the seat cushion
[1:13:29] I'm not giving you ideas I'll pray if it
[1:13:31] is in your mind and you do do that that
[1:13:33] God just exposes
[1:13:35] it but I hid it under the seat and the
[1:13:38] springs in my pickup and I went to
[1:13:41] church just like many of you do and you
[1:13:44] know why they invented all that hair gel
[1:13:47] is so backslid message kids can conb
[1:13:49] that long hair back over their head and
[1:13:52] it will stay there for a whole
[1:13:59] service and you walk
[1:14:01] out and you go down the road in The Same
[1:14:06] Spirit yes I think I spoke this at the
[1:14:08] church but it's been a little while
[1:14:10] since I've been here so I'll throw it
[1:14:11] out to you again you know brother Brown
[1:14:13] really didn't speak about rock and
[1:14:16] roll oh I imagine there might be young
[1:14:18] people
[1:14:21] heyen but you see Ro R would have been
[1:14:24] nothing if there hadn't been a spirit
[1:14:26] behind it this Bow Wow music that
[1:14:30] they've got now you say why do you call
[1:14:32] it bowwow because my brother in spirit
[1:14:34] it's a nothing but a bunch of hungry
[1:14:37] wolves that are bringing that music out
[1:14:40] hungering for the souls of
[1:14:43] people right you see it's a spirit
[1:14:45] behind it so when I say he didn't preach
[1:14:47] against rock and roll I want you to
[1:14:49] understand that you don't need to
[1:14:50] identify the actual individual thing
[1:14:52] that is the Affliction to our flesh that
[1:14:55] is the Affliction to our hearts and our
[1:14:56] minds and our souls because you just
[1:14:58] need to recognize the spirit that is
[1:15:00] there and you recognize the spirit Lord
[1:15:03] examine me am examine me Lord that every
[1:15:06] spirit that would be upon me whether it
[1:15:08] be a spirit of lust or Pride or or or
[1:15:12] whatever it is bitterness or whatever it
[1:15:14] might be Lord expose every Spirit come
[1:15:17] we say Amen Saints expose it Lord I want
[1:15:20] it out of my life I don't want to Harbor
[1:15:25] no safe place for the
[1:15:29] devil so you look at these things my
[1:15:31] brother and sister and we recognize what
[1:15:33] God is doing he's actually bringing us
[1:15:37] to know who we are can somebody tell you
[1:15:40] tell me who we
[1:15:44] are be
[1:15:48] bold we are the not a
[1:15:54] the Bride of Jesus
[1:15:58] Christ ultimately what we are sitting
[1:16:01] here today is for that Revelation to be
[1:16:03] anchored so deeply within our souls that
[1:16:06] Satan cannot dislodge it with any one of
[1:16:10] his
[1:16:11] tricks
[1:16:14] amen Revelations 19 one of my favorite
[1:16:18] chapters let's go to Luke 17 somebody
[1:16:21] out here please pray that brother Paul
[1:16:22] don't go on and on and on
[1:16:24] today and I don't say this for your sake
[1:16:27] I say it also for my sake amen Luke
[1:16:32] 17 would would would Saints would you
[1:16:35] just give me some just kind of be nice
[1:16:37] to me and lift a hand and say I'll do my
[1:16:40] homework amen I'll read that and I'll
[1:16:43] read it with an open heart and let the
[1:16:46] Lord speak to me amen it's a tremendous
[1:16:52] chapter
[1:16:54] Luke 17 I'm going to preach a story to
[1:16:56] you this morning if I can would that be
[1:16:58] all right no deep Mysteries this morning
[1:17:01] no deep things no tying this from the
[1:17:03] Old Testament all the way to here and
[1:17:05] this is here and this part this time no
[1:17:07] no just a simple story I want to preach
[1:17:09] to you and it came to pass as he went to
[1:17:12] Jerusalem that he passed through the
[1:17:13] midst of Samaria and Galilee and as he
[1:17:16] entered into a certain Village there met
[1:17:19] him 10 men that were lepers with stood
[1:17:23] AAR off now we know a leopard is one
[1:17:25] that's unclean he's Outcast he's
[1:17:30] separated and they lifted up their
[1:17:32] voices and said
[1:17:33] Jesus Master have mercy on
[1:17:37] us and when he saw them he said unto
[1:17:40] them go show yourselves unto the priests
[1:17:42] and it came to pass that as they went
[1:17:44] they were
[1:17:46] cleansed I think that's
[1:17:49] incredible didn't lay hands on
[1:17:52] them
[1:17:53] come on
[1:17:55] Amen now let's not come to the point
[1:17:58] that we think that there's no purpose
[1:17:59] for laying hands on there
[1:18:01] is but we're talking about in this
[1:18:03] circumstance they're unclean they're a
[1:18:05] far off Jesus does not break the
[1:18:10] custom
[1:18:13] right you'll never find him breaking the
[1:18:18] custom everything he says even from
[1:18:21] chasing them out of the
[1:18:24] temple was rooted in the
[1:18:31] word and so let me back up go show
[1:18:34] yourselves unto the priest so here here
[1:18:36] is a command that he gives to them and
[1:18:39] it came to pass that as they went they
[1:18:41] were cleansed and one of them when he
[1:18:44] saw that he was healed turned back and
[1:18:47] with a loud voice glorified God and fell
[1:18:50] down on his face at his feet giving
[1:18:52] giving him thanks and he was a
[1:18:55] Samaritan not an overly spiritualized
[1:18:58] man right you realize that's the
[1:19:00] Samaritans they were not overly
[1:19:01] spiritualized
[1:19:03] people now I'd embarrass somebody this
[1:19:06] morning if I said now how many of you
[1:19:07] think you're real
[1:19:08] spiritual right nothing wrong with that
[1:19:12] if you lifted a hand but I'll just be
[1:19:14] honest with you this
[1:19:16] morning I'm just a
[1:19:20] man sometimes I have to read the same
[1:19:23] verse in the Bible again and again and
[1:19:27] again and the whole time I'm reading it
[1:19:29] I'm saying Lord there's something here
[1:19:31] and I don't see it reveal this to me I
[1:19:34] need to I read a certain chapter we
[1:19:37] won't go into that but I read a certain
[1:19:39] chapter in the Bible for about 18 days
[1:19:42] straight my brother and sister I knew
[1:19:43] there was something there I couldn't
[1:19:45] find I'm not against those who read the
[1:19:48] Bible in a year that's good but I tell
[1:19:50] you if you're just thumbing through the
[1:19:51] verses and the page to get done in 365
[1:19:55] days I think you're going to miss a lot
[1:19:57] amen I think if you're willing to stop
[1:19:59] and say all of the word is relevant to
[1:20:01] my life Lord reveal every drop of it but
[1:20:04] I don't understand this verse and Lord
[1:20:05] I'm going to keep coming back with a
[1:20:07] prayer a request a desire for this word
[1:20:11] to speak to me amen and when it speaks
[1:20:15] to you well it unlocks a lot of other
[1:20:18] scripture for you but my brother and
[1:20:21] sister anybody can speed read a book now
[1:20:23] those of you went to college you know I
[1:20:25] didn't go to college I we sister Jerry
[1:20:27] and I took some classes but you know um
[1:20:31] you you can read through a lot of those
[1:20:33] things if you understand the the context
[1:20:35] of what you're reading you can read it
[1:20:36] very quickly I used to take a novel and
[1:20:40] just in in a few hours read the whole
[1:20:42] novel but if somebody come back and says
[1:20:44] what did Bob do at this time Bob's not
[1:20:48] important I don't care what Bob did but
[1:20:51] the word's not that way
[1:20:53] right every portion of word is relevant
[1:20:57] to the believer so don't speed read your
[1:21:01] Bible read it with integrity and intent
[1:21:05] and absorb it amen
[1:21:13] amen and so he comes and he gives praise
[1:21:17] and Jesus says now here in verse 16 he
[1:21:20] fell down on his face and give thanks
[1:21:22] and he was a Samaritan Jesus answered
[1:21:24] and said were there not 10 cleansed
[1:21:27] where are the nine and they're not found
[1:21:30] that return to give glory to God save
[1:21:34] this
[1:21:34] stranger and he said unto him arise go
[1:21:37] thy way thy
[1:21:41] faith right has healed you that's right
[1:21:45] is that what it
[1:21:47] says it's a little bit tricky there
[1:21:51] because it does say it healed
[1:21:54] him but he had another I I'm not I'm not
[1:21:59] preaching at you Saints I'm preaching to
[1:22:00] people like
[1:22:02] you he had other complexes that were
[1:22:05] hiding in there he had other things in
[1:22:08] his life that were out of line out of
[1:22:12] balance come on and Jesus says you've
[1:22:15] been made whole amen that's right not
[1:22:20] just leprosy taking from him but things
[1:22:23] deep down in the conscious state that
[1:22:25] would have tormented had bothered had
[1:22:28] troubled had hindered had done all of
[1:22:30] these things and every drop of that was
[1:22:33] taken from him I'm telling you when God
[1:22:35] says you're whole my brother and sister
[1:22:37] you don't walk out with a complex you
[1:22:39] don't walk out with a ISM and a sism and
[1:22:42] a and a fear and a doubt and an anxiety
[1:22:45] if you're whole you're whole it says
[1:22:47] complete amen whole is complete and who
[1:22:51] are we we sing that song Oh I sing so
[1:22:55] many songs in the tractor
[1:22:57] so
[1:23:01] modified amen and I get in public and I
[1:23:04] embarrassed myself but there's a song
[1:23:06] I'll put it that way that says complete
[1:23:09] complete complete in
[1:23:12] Jesus or at least that's the way I
[1:23:14] remember
[1:23:15] it now my brother and sister when Jesus
[1:23:18] said you're made whole right
[1:23:21] amen
[1:23:23] who wants to be whole this
[1:23:25] morning who wants to have that
[1:23:29] complete and it comes down you see the
[1:23:32] prophet of God talking about having the
[1:23:34] Holy Ghost in our
[1:23:36] day six different ways he mentions this
[1:23:40] but one I like to hold on to he says
[1:23:42] that you have received the word for your
[1:23:47] day and acted on
[1:23:51] it yes it's quite a bit of difference
[1:23:54] between just receiving it a lot of
[1:23:56] people say God sent a prophet but my
[1:23:58] brother and sister they don't listen to
[1:24:00] The Prophet they don't care what the
[1:24:01] prophet said in fact they do many things
[1:24:03] contrary to what the prophet said amen
[1:24:06] so there it is you cannot say that you
[1:24:08] have got a fullness a completeness and
[1:24:11] whole if you refuse to act on the word
[1:24:14] of God so this man under the message of
[1:24:18] his hour went away from there with a
[1:24:21] revelation
[1:24:22] of who he was and what he was supposed
[1:24:25] to do and how he was supposed to live
[1:24:27] the
[1:24:30] gospel are you with
[1:24:35] me 10
[1:24:37] healed one comes
[1:24:43] back they're healed in body nine healed
[1:24:46] in body yeah one I'm going to make it
[1:24:49] simple today healed in his soul
[1:24:55] which one would we
[1:24:58] choose Lord make me completely whole
[1:25:00] Hallelujah I stand before this crowd of
[1:25:03] witnesses Lord make me completely whole
[1:25:06] I don't want just healing my body and I
[1:25:07] have some afflictions in my flesh that I
[1:25:09] would love to be healed from but I want
[1:25:12] to be completely whole and if I had to
[1:25:15] choose between being completely whole
[1:25:17] spiritually and completely whole
[1:25:19] physically I will choose completely
[1:25:21] whole spiritually
[1:25:22] any day amen over that amen hallelujah
[1:25:26] sister Rebecca we prayed a lot of
[1:25:28] prayers for you amen I tell you they
[1:25:30] have strung through the years I don't
[1:25:32] mean to embarrass anyone but they've
[1:25:33] strung through the years and we see God
[1:25:36] come on the scene because my brother and
[1:25:38] sister we're living in the day of being
[1:25:41] completely whole God doesn't want a
[1:25:44] partially healed bride he don't want to
[1:25:46] partially serve me bride he wants a
[1:25:48] bride that's soul out amen that she's
[1:25:51] willing oh I tell you what happens my
[1:25:54] brother and sister let me just put it
[1:25:56] this way they're there all of them
[1:25:58] together praise God brother look the
[1:26:00] leprosy is falling off of me yes oh
[1:26:03] praise
[1:26:05] God hey what are you
[1:26:09] doing
[1:26:10] uh honestly I don't know what I'm
[1:26:14] doing I just feel like I I need to turn
[1:26:17] around yeah and go say thank you
[1:26:23] I don't understand what's happening in
[1:26:25] me I don't know but I got to go back and
[1:26:29] tell him thank you and he turns around
[1:26:32] and he goes back and it is that
[1:26:35] Revelation comes with footsteps we can't
[1:26:39] sit on our hands and say God's going to
[1:26:41] give me Revelation God's going to give
[1:26:43] me Revelation God wants you to March he
[1:26:46] wants you to walk he wants you to move
[1:26:49] he wants you to act on the word of God
[1:26:51] and as he's walking back to Jesus I
[1:26:54] believe this with all of my heart he
[1:26:55] started realizing wait he wasn't talking
[1:26:59] about the priest in the temple he was
[1:27:01] talking about my priest and my priest is
[1:27:04] right here and I'm going to go back and
[1:27:06] I'm going to give praise to
[1:27:08] him prise the Lord amen am I getting too
[1:27:12] carried
[1:27:13] away amen but the Revelation that turned
[1:27:17] him around oh aren't you glad God turned
[1:27:19] you
[1:27:20] around oh I live my heart to God every
[1:27:23] single day good days and bad days thank
[1:27:25] you Lord for turning me
[1:27:27] around amen amen
[1:27:30] hallelujah you know that's what
[1:27:32] repentance
[1:27:34] is going One Direction being completely
[1:27:36] turned around going back the other
[1:27:38] direction
[1:27:39] amen Lord forgive me but you can't
[1:27:42] continue on the same footsteps and say
[1:27:44] well the Lord forgave me now I can go do
[1:27:46] it
[1:27:47] again so one's made whole now Romans 12
[1:27:54] 1 through3 said I beseech ye therefore
[1:27:56] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[1:27:59] present your bodies a Living
[1:28:03] Sacrifice now no natural we're not of
[1:28:07] the spirit of mullik
[1:28:09] right we're not going to throw our
[1:28:12] children or whatever but I Tell You
[1:28:14] Through the Ages I've seen many a family
[1:28:16] sacrific their
[1:28:19] children they start by the parent
[1:28:24] God help you parents want you to know I
[1:28:26] love
[1:28:27] you but if you are not standing firm on
[1:28:30] the life this gospel because of
[1:28:33] something in your own
[1:28:34] life that's you know I can't tell my
[1:28:38] children not to listen to this if I'm
[1:28:42] listening to this see how the devil's so
[1:28:45] clever so clever binds the parent so
[1:28:49] that that Spirit can be passed to
[1:28:50] another generation
[1:28:54] and each generation says well I did it I
[1:28:56] can't really speak out against it
[1:28:58] there's a cleansing blood my brother and
[1:29:00] sister there's a fountain open in the
[1:29:03] House of David when you've been washed
[1:29:05] from that you can stand to your children
[1:29:08] and say don't go out here with this
[1:29:10] Behavior don't listen to this don't do
[1:29:13] that the kids might say Mom and Dad you
[1:29:16] did it no I did not and they're going to
[1:29:19] be what no I'm a new creature that's the
[1:29:22] old man that looked like your
[1:29:25] [Applause]
[1:29:26] daddy oh I'm telling you I've been there
[1:29:29] Saints I've looked my own children in
[1:29:32] the face and them raising an eyebrow you
[1:29:34] know how kids can do that like oh really
[1:29:38] dad and I used to come to a halt on that
[1:29:40] like
[1:29:41] oh how can I talk about
[1:29:44] that well I'll tell you how I finally
[1:29:47] got what was that guy in in mythology or
[1:29:51] whatever ever that you know didn't get
[1:29:55] his heel in the
[1:29:57] water and of all the
[1:29:59] places that
[1:30:03] Achilles of all the places that the
[1:30:05] arrow of the enemy would
[1:30:09] attack the arrows struck him right there
[1:30:12] in the
[1:30:13] heel come on
[1:30:15] parents grandparents brothers sisters
[1:30:19] preachers get it under the blood
[1:30:22] that's right and when it's under the
[1:30:23] blood you can tell your children don't
[1:30:25] you go parking don't you go petting
[1:30:28] don't you do this don't you do that they
[1:30:30] know good and well you did it but you as
[1:30:33] a new creature in Christ Jesus dipped in
[1:30:35] the blood of Jesus Christ can stand and
[1:30:37] say kids unless you want a negative
[1:30:39] thing to come in your life don't do
[1:30:43] it that's right amen I don't know why I
[1:30:46] threw that one in praise the
[1:30:50] Lord present your bodies a Living
[1:30:53] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[1:30:56] is your reasonable service and be not
[1:30:59] conformed to this world but be ye
[1:31:01] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:31:04] that ye may prove what is that good and
[1:31:08] acceptable and perfect will of God for I
[1:31:11] say through the grace given unto me to
[1:31:14] every man that is among you not to think
[1:31:16] of himself more highly than he ought to
[1:31:19] think but to think soberly according as
[1:31:22] God hath dealt to every man a Measure of
[1:31:33] Faith I don't have as big a measure as
[1:31:36] other brothers pastors
[1:31:38] ministers
[1:31:42] Saints but coupling that together with
[1:31:44] my grace is
[1:31:47] sufficient I have the measure of faith I
[1:31:51] need
[1:31:52] paraphrasing it the prophet of God said
[1:31:55] everything you need to make the Rapture
[1:31:58] is all ready in
[1:32:02] you amen do we have any rapturing faith
[1:32:05] this morning amen it's in US Saints
[1:32:08] don't be searching around growling in
[1:32:10] the dirt somewhere running to and fro
[1:32:12] trying to find it it's already in you
[1:32:14] the key is take the key which is the
[1:32:17] word of God and unlock it and when it's
[1:32:21] unlocked
[1:32:25] available now what's the measure of
[1:32:28] Faith now what I'm fixing to go into I I
[1:32:31] kind of awkwardly shared this with the
[1:32:34] brothers made it sound like I was going
[1:32:35] to have something outside the message I
[1:32:37] don't
[1:32:39] know brother I don't know how I managed
[1:32:42] to bungle that so bad you know but here
[1:32:45] we go this is just an example okay I I
[1:32:48] don't take this as some fixed thing from
[1:32:50] the message are you okay if I share this
[1:32:52] are you guys Discerning enough to take
[1:32:54] you know my fumbles and throw them
[1:32:57] out I'll tell you what I'm going to take
[1:33:00] a word of God from the prophet he said
[1:33:02] you go to that church and if there's
[1:33:04] only one
[1:33:05] thing so if you only walk out of here
[1:33:07] with one thing today I I was
[1:33:09] successful amen now look at this I
[1:33:13] should have had the brothers graph this
[1:33:14] on the screen for you but the measure of
[1:33:16] faith my brother and sister we have a a
[1:33:19] lot of spiritual types and I'm I'm going
[1:33:21] to I'm going to just give you some
[1:33:23] measures here real quick first
[1:33:28] measure I believe in God I believe there
[1:33:30] is a God now you realize there's a lot
[1:33:33] of humanity doesn't believe that
[1:33:35] anymore they're coming down to where
[1:33:37] their their view is this can't be of God
[1:33:40] God's a supernatural holy God and this
[1:33:42] is what it is I I just can't believe in
[1:33:45] that so the first measure first little
[1:33:47] scoop is is they start to believe in
[1:33:50] God and you'll find a true
[1:33:55] atheist he don't have any
[1:33:58] understanding to him there can not be a
[1:34:03] God and I don't mean to be too humorous
[1:34:06] and and take away from the word of God
[1:34:07] today but my brother and sister there
[1:34:10] might possibly be some people on the
[1:34:13] Earth that some static electricity lit
[1:34:16] some moss on
[1:34:18] fire and now they exist right
[1:34:24] yes
[1:34:27] impossible otherwise it would be
[1:34:29] happening again and again and
[1:34:34] again so there's no measure there
[1:34:37] nothing's been poured in some of these
[1:34:39] are highly intelligent people now in
[1:34:42] case you guys wonder when I say highly
[1:34:43] intelligent I'm talking about most of
[1:34:45] you amen I understand
[1:34:49] dirt amen
[1:34:52] and I do believe I understand the bride
[1:34:54] of
[1:34:55] Christ but not much else not much
[1:35:00] else second measure would be someone
[1:35:03] having it poured into him saying oh God
[1:35:05] cares for me do you remember that time
[1:35:08] of your life when that second measure
[1:35:11] poured in God cares for me I mean
[1:35:14] something to him and then it comes a
[1:35:16] third measure would be that you would be
[1:35:19] able to say he's my savior
[1:35:22] so you see he's pouring more into us
[1:35:24] bringing us from nothing starting to
[1:35:27] bring us into a real position something
[1:35:29] of substance and he comes along and my
[1:35:32] brother and sister you can recognize
[1:35:34] he's your savior amen but you need this
[1:35:37] fourth measure that brings you to the
[1:35:41] place I trust
[1:35:44] him you can declare him your
[1:35:47] savior and not trust him that's true
[1:35:53] I've done marriage counseling on couples
[1:35:55] that were like well this is my husband
[1:35:57] this is my wife that's wonderful you've
[1:35:59] been brought together in matrimony but I
[1:36:02] don't trust him in fact brother Paul I
[1:36:05] don't even think I like
[1:36:07] him okay so we have a ways to
[1:36:13] go but my brother and sister look at
[1:36:15] this we come to this place I don't know
[1:36:19] about you okay we all come from
[1:36:20] different directions
[1:36:22] I come from a kid that was raised in a
[1:36:23] message church and chose to walk
[1:36:25] away let me give you a little analogy
[1:36:28] here I am 15 years
[1:36:31] old a real relationship with Jesus
[1:36:34] Christ is right there and I'm not going
[1:36:36] to do it physically but I went over here
[1:36:40] and I went up there and I went out that
[1:36:41] door I come back in that door I went up
[1:36:43] there I went over there I went there I
[1:36:44] went there I started to comeing back
[1:36:45] down here I went back up I went over
[1:36:47] there I went out that door I went over
[1:36:48] here I went to the four year I went out
[1:36:49] in the kitchen I went and I find finally
[1:36:51] made it back down and got here one day
[1:36:53] and
[1:36:55] realized this is who I
[1:36:59] am and I had to do all that to learn to
[1:37:01] trust
[1:37:03] him when if I had just surrendered and
[1:37:06] said Lord I know you're my savior and if
[1:37:10] you're my savior I can trust you I don't
[1:37:13] know if any of you ever had that
[1:37:14] experience amen I tell you what's sad is
[1:37:17] see I didn't do all of that
[1:37:19] alone sister Jerry married me and God
[1:37:22] just knew as much as sister Jerry being
[1:37:25] a Godly girl got saved and never wavered
[1:37:27] once in her life there must have been
[1:37:29] some character he must have wanted to
[1:37:30] mold in her there had to be something he
[1:37:33] wanted to mold in
[1:37:35] her or he molded it in her enough that
[1:37:39] she could actually speak it to me am
[1:37:41] Paul I don't care what you do I am going
[1:37:44] to serve God Amen hard words even as I
[1:37:48] say them right now emotion comes up
[1:37:50] within me
[1:37:52] I brought my own wife to a position she
[1:37:55] had to be that
[1:37:57] bold but it took all of that for me to
[1:37:59] trust
[1:38:01] him and I finally come to the place I
[1:38:05] Trust You Lord amen in the morning in
[1:38:07] the noon in the night and especially in
[1:38:10] the night I Trust You
[1:38:15] Lord prise God the fifth measure would
[1:38:20] be faith for healing
[1:38:23] God pours in enough
[1:38:24] Faith see you can't really pray for
[1:38:28] healing without having
[1:38:33] trust I'm talking to message Believers
[1:38:35] you realize God does hold you to a
[1:38:37] slightly different standard than
[1:38:39] denomination denomination blindly
[1:38:42] staggers into things and God honors
[1:38:44] it but God doesn't want iniquity in us
[1:38:48] that's right if we know he wants want us
[1:38:52] to
[1:38:54] do and he gives us faith for healing
[1:38:56] anyone been healed can we just give
[1:38:59] praise to the Lord lift your hands up
[1:39:00] high Saints amen let's give praise to
[1:39:03] the
[1:39:09] Lord hallelujah he pours in that measure
[1:39:12] of faith that in my little example that
[1:39:15] fifth Measure of Faith for healing and
[1:39:17] you're healed and that sixth measure he
[1:39:20] comes is when he pours in faith to
[1:39:22] believe every
[1:39:24] [Music]
[1:39:26] word every
[1:39:32] word you wonder why I threw the word
[1:39:35] iniquity out to you early so I just want
[1:39:38] to loosen you up to the simple fact that
[1:39:42] when we finally reach the level of every
[1:39:50] word
[1:39:52] two cups Saints you can follow it
[1:39:54] through the scriptures expressed in many
[1:39:55] ways two cups the cup of
[1:39:58] iniquity and the cup of righteousness
[1:40:01] right do you know we all possess those
[1:40:03] two
[1:40:04] cups and do you realize my brother and
[1:40:06] sister the essence is that it's really
[1:40:09] just one cup we're not walking around
[1:40:11] with two cups we have one cup and if we
[1:40:15] take this cup and we pour iniquity in
[1:40:18] the cup right cuz he says that when his
[1:40:20] Wrath would come when the cup of
[1:40:22] iniquity
[1:40:23] runthe so you pour iniquity into that
[1:40:26] cup you fill the cup everything about
[1:40:28] our life is going to be
[1:40:30] iniquity amen come on that's right look
[1:40:33] I want to make a point maybe to these
[1:40:35] young people might might I don't know
[1:40:36] why make a fool out of myself but that's
[1:40:38] all right I don't I hope none of you
[1:40:41] would say I recognize that brother Paul
[1:40:43] but you see a grew up on a farm school
[1:40:46] bus would come my mama would see me out
[1:40:49] the door and it was there my mama
[1:40:53] shirt's going to be buttoned up shirts
[1:40:55] going to be tucked in
[1:40:57] ETC by the time I got to my seat on the
[1:41:00] school bus my pants were pulled down
[1:41:02] that's nothing new you know
[1:41:03] that nothing new Under the Sun pants
[1:41:07] pulled down shirt untuck cuffs undone
[1:41:09] shirt buttoned halfway
[1:41:14] down went to school walked around the
[1:41:16] hallways of the
[1:41:18] school we were bad man
[1:41:21] yeah got off the school bus in front of
[1:41:23] my house looked like I just come from
[1:41:25] choir
[1:41:28] practice it ain't no way to live Saints
[1:41:31] young people it's no way to live that's
[1:41:33] right be who God calls you to be he
[1:41:36] didn't call you to be one of these
[1:41:38] little thugs on the street he called you
[1:41:39] to be a son or daughter of God pour the
[1:41:42] cup of iniquity out and fill it up with
[1:41:45] righteousness but brother Paul I'm
[1:41:46] trying I'm trying keep trying cuz you
[1:41:48] see it doesn't work like we think oh
[1:41:50] we're we're going to just empty the cup
[1:41:51] and fill it back up no what happens we
[1:41:53] have our cup of iniquity and God starts
[1:41:55] pouring righteousness into the iniquity
[1:41:58] and it causes great conflict within us
[1:42:00] we we struggle we agonize we labor we
[1:42:03] question am I really a Christian I don't
[1:42:05] think I'm a I don't know I'm a Christian
[1:42:07] God deals with I know I'm a Christian
[1:42:09] you get back out in school or wherever I
[1:42:11] don't know if I am and God still
[1:42:13] continuing to pour righteousness into
[1:42:15] that cup and there comes a day my
[1:42:17] brother and sister because oil and water
[1:42:19] do not mix amen righteousness and
[1:42:22] iniquity do not make and God keeps
[1:42:24] pouring into the cup until one day we
[1:42:27] can be my cop run is over oh he's filled
[1:42:32] me so full there's no room in my life
[1:42:35] for
[1:42:37] iniquity but Satan will search for the
[1:42:40] residue and this is a point I want to
[1:42:42] make about iniquity this morning Satan
[1:42:45] will search for the residue of iniquity
[1:42:49] in our lives and emphasize it blow it up
[1:42:53] make it look greater than it really
[1:42:56] is but God's over here pouring
[1:42:59] righteousness Hallelujah into the cup
[1:43:03] and sooner than
[1:43:06] later the righteousness
[1:43:09] washes every drop of iniquity amen prise
[1:43:14] from our cup the
[1:43:18] Lord but my flesh isn't perfect
[1:43:22] I could have brought you a quote this
[1:43:23] morning where brother bam said you are
[1:43:24] going to fight your flesh right to the
[1:43:27] coming of the
[1:43:28] Lord my goodness why don't you just
[1:43:30] acknowledge it not give into it and say
[1:43:32] okay I can just be friends with my
[1:43:34] flesh recognize your flesh is not your
[1:43:39] friend but God's pouring righteousness
[1:43:41] into us can someone lift their hand and
[1:43:44] say thank you Lord keep pouring Lord I'm
[1:43:48] here to receive it I want my up to run
[1:43:52] over oh
[1:43:59] Hallelujah
[1:44:02] see moving on the
[1:44:05] story sorry I feel a little disjointed
[1:44:08] here because I got about 300 other
[1:44:10] things I want to add on the tale of that
[1:44:12] and at home I I we have one service and
[1:44:15] usually I preach kind of on the long
[1:44:17] side and you know people some times are
[1:44:21] a little bit you know like couldn't you
[1:44:24] you know have just cut it off right here
[1:44:27] let the word flow all the rest of that
[1:44:29] was
[1:44:31] fluff well I've noticed that some of you
[1:44:33] when you're a coffee shop you go in
[1:44:34] there and they whipped cream a
[1:44:41] lot then you sat there and liit the
[1:44:43] whipped cream I thought it was meant to
[1:44:45] be mixed in but some of you sat
[1:44:49] there
[1:44:53] sometimes I get too much whipped
[1:44:56] cream but Saints I want you to see this
[1:45:00] I want this just to be a story something
[1:45:01] you take home amen amen amen I mean if
[1:45:05] you feel like we need an altar call at
[1:45:06] the end of a service it's not even
[1:45:08] oriented to that we can make the altar
[1:45:09] call if you want to come but sometimes I
[1:45:11] think the Saints just need to be
[1:45:13] reminded just need to be fed amen we're
[1:45:15] not feeding you lollipops we're feeding
[1:45:17] you the
[1:45:18] word amen so look at this analogy these
[1:45:21] 10 men all obeyed the
[1:45:24] word sister in our church said brother
[1:45:27] Paul I I work with this man and uh when
[1:45:29] I talk about these things he's there me
[1:45:33] too well God's doing me too God's moving
[1:45:38] me too God's healing me
[1:45:40] too she said brother Paul how do I
[1:45:44] answer well I'll tell you how you answer
[1:45:46] my brother and sister right here is your
[1:45:48] answer maybe not word for word
[1:45:51] all obeyed the
[1:45:53] word hallelujah I have a very large
[1:45:56] cross-section of friends everything
[1:45:58] Roman Catholics methodists Nazarene
[1:46:00] Baptist
[1:46:03] Mormon all kinds I got a Mormon Bishop
[1:46:07] calls me up real regular I love talking
[1:46:09] to you I'm ignoring my wife in the car
[1:46:12] as we travel on vacation Paul but I just
[1:46:14] wanted to talk to you cuz you just have
[1:46:17] such a unique
[1:46:19] perspective yes a word
[1:46:24] perspective all obeyed the
[1:46:27] word and all were able to say we did
[1:46:30] what we were told are you following me
[1:46:33] in the story every one of them he says
[1:46:36] Go and show yourself to the priest
[1:46:40] that's right all 10 can say we were
[1:46:43] going showing oursel to the
[1:46:49] priest
[1:46:51] able to say we did what Jesus said what
[1:46:54] we were told right from the red letter
[1:46:57] of the Bible we're doing what he told us
[1:47:00] to do right now no one please leave
[1:47:03] today thinking I'm speaking down on
[1:47:05] these people like I told you they're my
[1:47:06] friends these are men I rub shoulders
[1:47:09] with I interact when I hear that their
[1:47:11] baby is sick or granddaughter is sick I
[1:47:12] call them up and tell them I'm praying
[1:47:14] for
[1:47:16] you and when times are tough for us they
[1:47:19] call me up and say I'm praying for you
[1:47:21] amen I don't throw that out as something
[1:47:25] of no
[1:47:27] value I receive that and I tell them
[1:47:29] thank you and I tell them God bless
[1:47:32] you and it's amazing you'd think a
[1:47:34] Baptist would be all over God bless you
[1:47:37] but you tell them God bless you and
[1:47:39] they're
[1:47:44] like you're not
[1:47:48] Baptist I don't know if God can bless
[1:47:51] you you're not LDS I don't know if God
[1:47:54] can bless you well I don't care I think
[1:47:57] you're a fine man God bless
[1:48:01] you see they can say look we we took
[1:48:04] Jesus words right from the red letter of
[1:48:07] our
[1:48:11] Bible they were
[1:48:13] obedient and they were
[1:48:17] healed but they were not drawn
[1:48:21] into the
[1:48:23] mystery are you with me I don't mean to
[1:48:26] get
[1:48:27] wo don't you like that when preachers
[1:48:29] preach the
[1:48:31] mystery and we're all like I don't know
[1:48:34] what you're talking
[1:48:37] about come on you see they were all
[1:48:40] healed but not drawn into the mystery I
[1:48:41] don't mean to make light Saints I'm
[1:48:43] sorry I just when Paul feels good Paul
[1:48:46] it's funny or at least he thinks he's
[1:48:49] funny
[1:48:51] but they weren't drawn into the
[1:48:53] mystery you see when he said go show
[1:48:55] yourself to the priest those nine said
[1:48:58] I'm doing what I was told right come on
[1:49:01] they went right down showed their
[1:49:02] themselves at the priest there and and
[1:49:05] said look
[1:49:06] priest I met Jesus you are on probation
[1:49:10] from the church for 90 days for even
[1:49:12] mentioning that name inside our
[1:49:15] building no they didn't care Jesus told
[1:49:18] me go show myself to the priest amen
[1:49:21] they're already healed right now they're
[1:49:23] just being obedient right but one as I
[1:49:27] did sorry I hope I'm not distracting you
[1:49:29] but one God out there ways
[1:49:33] something something just started pulling
[1:49:37] him back and Revelation come and he says
[1:49:40] that's my
[1:49:41] priest I got to be you see you say
[1:49:44] brother Paul that's not really in the
[1:49:45] message but I believe I have Foundation
[1:49:47] because you see my brother and sister
[1:49:48] Jesus told them to show yourself to the
[1:49:51] priest he couldn't circumvent that
[1:49:54] command and it be the Fulfillment of the
[1:49:57] word so if he just went back to Jesus
[1:49:59] but that was not Revelation to him then
[1:50:01] he didn't fulfill the words of Jesus but
[1:50:04] he did fulfill the words of Jesus and he
[1:50:06] turned right back and he went and said
[1:50:08] this is my priest here and Jesus says
[1:50:11] Hey where's the rest of them my brother
[1:50:13] sister do you see where I'm going you
[1:50:15] see this that God had now in the mystery
[1:50:18] what is the mystery we'll get to it in a
[1:50:20] minute but you know it amen now in the
[1:50:22] mystery my brother and sister they went
[1:50:25] on doing exactly and they went and they
[1:50:28] showed themselves to the priest and
[1:50:29] because leper is also associated with
[1:50:32] separation they were now reunited re
[1:50:35] reestablished they can now be part of
[1:50:38] the church they can go back to their
[1:50:39] family they can go in fellowship and all
[1:50:42] of this and they're everywhere they went
[1:50:44] brother they're there and look at this
[1:50:46] amen I met Jesus on the outside of the
[1:50:47] city and and he told me go show myself
[1:50:50] to the priest praise God we have such a
[1:50:51] good priest and now I'm
[1:50:55] Healed they had a
[1:50:59] testimony one come
[1:51:01] back to the priest our high priest amen
[1:51:05] amen amen and Jesus then speaks these
[1:51:08] words that strike my heart so
[1:51:11] deep now you're completely
[1:51:15] whole from head to
[1:51:18] toe everything my brother and sister in
[1:51:22] the flesh I say thank you amen as I
[1:51:24] brought up earlier I don't mean to
[1:51:26] embarrass you sister Rebecca but God
[1:51:28] moves in mysterious ways and he's a
[1:51:29] powerful God and nothing's going to
[1:51:31] stand in his way amen cancer the prophet
[1:51:34] said will not stand in your way am mean
[1:51:39] God speaking to the prophet and the
[1:51:40] prophet amen poured all he had into the
[1:51:44] church and the church can stand on that
[1:51:48] promise amen amen and these men every
[1:51:52] day nine through the
[1:51:55] city yes I've been
[1:51:58] healed I've been
[1:52:02] healed right
[1:52:03] back to their old
[1:52:12] worship you ever wonder why brother
[1:52:15] brandom could have such phenomenal
[1:52:17] results in those meetings conversions
[1:52:21] deliverances
[1:52:24] discernments I've heard it
[1:52:27] explained well brother brandham sent
[1:52:29] them back to their church because there
[1:52:30] were no message
[1:52:32] churches to send them
[1:52:35] to I have a slightly different
[1:52:40] opinion they
[1:52:43] did what the word told them to
[1:52:46] do they went
[1:52:48] back and they stayed
[1:52:51] there but there was some I know them
[1:52:54] personally that went back and then sat
[1:52:58] in church and
[1:52:59] listened and we'll tell you our pastor
[1:53:02] was a fine godly
[1:53:05] man but what he preached would not
[1:53:08] Satisfy My
[1:53:14] Soul and they could tell you I did
[1:53:16] exactly what the prophet told me to do
[1:53:21] that's right but some went and
[1:53:24] set and said this is not good enough
[1:53:28] I've now tasted of the goodness of Jesus
[1:53:31] Christ and they got up I think brother
[1:53:35] Mike so P he'd have a testimony that
[1:53:37] might relate to that got up out of that
[1:53:41] and said I cannot sit here and starve to
[1:53:43] death I have to go find the word I've
[1:53:48] got to go find the revealed word amen
[1:53:52] and so here they are now all coming back
[1:53:55] together Jesus has went on he's went off
[1:53:57] to other cities other places and they're
[1:54:00] all back in their same
[1:54:02] community and they meet on the street
[1:54:05] imagine brother Ezra they all meet
[1:54:07] together I don't want to make you look
[1:54:09] negative but I can't tell the story and
[1:54:11] me be negative can I
[1:54:15] right hey brother Ezra how you doing
[1:54:19] fine you know I can tell it from the
[1:54:21] other side there's nine of us over here
[1:54:23] you just don't see us brother Ezra how
[1:54:26] you doing oh doing good we know we
[1:54:30] always wondered what happened to you
[1:54:31] that day I don't know if you just didn't
[1:54:33] have enough faith brother Ezra to
[1:54:35] believe him to go down and show yourself
[1:54:36] to the priest uh you know next thing we
[1:54:39] know you're not walking with us you're
[1:54:40] not in fellowship with us
[1:54:42] anymore and we went back and showed
[1:54:44] oursel to the priests and and it's so
[1:54:46] wonderful because now you know that this
[1:54:49] this leprosy this separation has gone
[1:54:51] from me I've been invited back into the
[1:54:53] church they showed me where my name has
[1:54:55] been reinstated on the
[1:54:57] book and you know I used to used to
[1:55:01] speak the young adults class and and
[1:55:03] they never did find a good teacher and
[1:55:05] so now that I'm clean again they just
[1:55:07] they let me take my position but what
[1:55:10] happened to you brother
[1:55:15] Ezra I did what he
[1:55:18] said what do you mean I went back to
[1:55:22] Jesus no no no no you don't understand
[1:55:25] he told us to go to to the priest I did
[1:55:29] yeah
[1:55:31] amen I don't want to drag this out and
[1:55:33] be labor it but I believe you follow me
[1:55:35] every little aspect well we're now part
[1:55:38] of the Rotary Club where Ezra you never
[1:55:41] came back we're now part of this deal
[1:55:44] over here and we we're on the baseball
[1:55:46] team and we're on the church this and
[1:55:48] we're on the church church that Ezra you
[1:55:50] never came
[1:55:53] back and what it can come down to my
[1:55:56] brother and sister is you'll sit there
[1:55:59] and you'll try to witness to people and
[1:56:02] they will tell you me
[1:56:04] too me too me too me
[1:56:10] too this is going to come out a little
[1:56:12] blunter than I meant it to
[1:56:17] be they have an
[1:56:20] experience but they were not
[1:56:23] drawn into the
[1:56:27] mystery they can testify everything
[1:56:31] saints that you can
[1:56:34] testify but they're not in the
[1:56:39] mystery are we good okay let me hurry up
[1:56:43] and finish somebody just pray brother
[1:56:44] Paul
[1:56:45] finishes
[1:56:48] amen you see
[1:56:50] see 1 Corinthians 2:7 from our original
[1:56:54] scripture but we speak the wisdom of God
[1:56:56] in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[1:57:00] which God ordained before the world
[1:57:03] unto
[1:57:04] unto
[1:57:07] unto our
[1:57:09] glory amen this mystery hope hope yall
[1:57:12] don't mind I don't want to sound selfish
[1:57:14] but this mystery is for
[1:57:17] me all that was done all down through
[1:57:19] this mystery was for me can somebody say
[1:57:23] me
[1:57:23] [Laughter]
[1:57:27] too all of this was for me we're not
[1:57:30] being selfish we're we're not you know I
[1:57:33] I I got some other words but they're too
[1:57:35] harsh uh no no this is for us my brother
[1:57:39] and sister now don't you always love it
[1:57:42] any of you old enough to listen to Paul
[1:57:46] Harvey do any of you even know who Paul
[1:57:48] Harvey is
[1:57:51] okay I know we're not supposed to lift
[1:57:53] our hands and say Amen on things like
[1:57:55] Paul
[1:57:56] Harvey but Paul Harvey always had the
[1:57:59] rest of the story right and we never
[1:58:01] want to stop until the story stops we
[1:58:04] got to keep going so the rest of the
[1:58:06] story my brother and sister I I I
[1:58:08] already shared part of that but you see
[1:58:11] they come into this and there's this
[1:58:12] point yeah we listened to Jesus we did
[1:58:15] exactly what it said I got a red letter
[1:58:17] bible just like you did we believe every
[1:58:19] part of the red letter and all of this
[1:58:21] is but there's something different right
[1:58:23] something something that's just not the
[1:58:25] same I want to just ask you a simple
[1:58:28] question you remember when God called
[1:58:29] you
[1:58:31] out it wasn't the same
[1:58:34] anymore you picked your Bible up and you
[1:58:38] were like I always thought this was such
[1:58:42] a
[1:58:44] mystery but now the mystery is being
[1:58:48] opened yes
[1:58:52] amen now I know because you're well
[1:58:57] taught some of these crazy people in the
[1:59:00] message can believe they can read
[1:59:02] between the
[1:59:05] lines would you agree with me they must
[1:59:08] be just out of their
[1:59:12] mind that might be a little tricky
[1:59:15] amen they're out of their
[1:59:18] minds because they now have the mind of
[1:59:22] Christ they're no longer in their mind
[1:59:26] they have moved lest I sound mysterious
[1:59:30] they've moved into the
[1:59:31] mystery they're taking steps into the
[1:59:34] mystery and the Mystery is starting to
[1:59:37] unfold now my brother and sister you
[1:59:38] can't have the mystery unfold unless
[1:59:41] you're a part of the
[1:59:44] mystery you have to be a part amen for
[1:59:49] it to be real to
[1:59:52] you brother Ron hasn't sent the deacons
[1:59:54] yet so I think we're
[1:59:57] okay what is it but hidden deep in the
[2:00:01] heart of that Samaritan Saints was a
[2:00:04] knowledge of the mystery he didn't even
[2:00:05] know he was part of a mystery he didn't
[2:00:06] know nothing about nothing he didn't
[2:00:08] have any comprehension but here he is
[2:00:11] something pulling the third poll don't
[2:00:14] you just love the third pole I love the
[2:00:17] third poll amen how the prophet brings
[2:00:19] that out gives us very clear vision and
[2:00:21] the third bll being kind of tied I I say
[2:00:24] kind of I just don't want to emphasize
[2:00:26] that being tied my brother and sister
[2:00:28] between reading the lines if you are not
[2:00:31] part of the third pole you can't look at
[2:00:34] the word and read between the lines
[2:00:36] that's right and some people like well I
[2:00:38] don't know about that reading between
[2:00:39] the lines well if you're a holy ghost
[2:00:40] filled believer you've been reading
[2:00:42] between the lines and maybe never even
[2:00:43] knew it amen amen but we have a
[2:00:46] misconception of what reading between
[2:00:48] the lines is we think we have got a
[2:00:50] holds of our Bible our message book and
[2:00:52] we have pride the word open and we're
[2:00:55] looking in over here at the mystery no
[2:00:58] wonder the unbeliever thinks you're all
[2:01:01] crazy because they missed the fact it
[2:01:03] was just the opposite God opened the
[2:01:06] word I don't know if I could do this
[2:01:08] correct God opened the word
[2:01:12] reached and pulled
[2:01:15] you it's not you opening the word and
[2:01:20] looking in it was God opened the word
[2:01:24] and got a hold to you and pulled you
[2:01:27] into the word but the carnal mind says
[2:01:31] oh what do you mean that you can open
[2:01:32] the word and look beyond that nonsense
[2:01:35] well they're not in the mystery they're
[2:01:38] not part of this revelation of the
[2:01:39] mystery but when God comes and opens his
[2:01:43] word and reaches out and grabs you and
[2:01:45] pulls you into the word you can't help
[2:01:49] yourself I see it I see it what do you
[2:01:52] see Christ it's not denomination pulling
[2:01:57] you it's not message pulling you it's
[2:01:59] not a pastor pulling you it's God Amen
[2:02:03] our Lord Jesus Christ himself opened the
[2:02:06] word reached out got to Hal to you and
[2:02:09] pulls you into his
[2:02:11] presence and the word takes on a whole
[2:02:13] new
[2:02:15] life and someone says explain that to me
[2:02:20] uh well one day I was reading my Bible
[2:02:23] right I read my Bible me
[2:02:27] too I don't see what you're talking
[2:02:29] about right well I I was reading in my
[2:02:32] seals book I read my seals
[2:02:38] book God spoke to me God speaks to me
[2:02:42] too but what they're missing is the
[2:02:46] mystery of God opening his
[2:02:49] word and reaching out getting a hold of
[2:02:52] you and pulling you into the
[2:02:57] mystery the carnal mind turns that
[2:03:00] around and thinks we must do something
[2:03:03] I'll tell you I've done nothing that's
[2:03:06] right I've been given a good gift of the
[2:03:08] Gospel of Jesus Christ I've been given
[2:03:11] the good gift of the love of Jesus
[2:03:13] Christ I've been given the good gift of
[2:03:15] his holy spirit nothing I ever could
[2:03:19] have attained to am amen but he said
[2:03:23] come see it from my point of
[2:03:26] view here it is you know there's a lot
[2:03:29] of etiquette I think it's funny you look
[2:03:30] on the internet and they'll tell you now
[2:03:32] if you're crossing a Rancher or Farmer's
[2:03:34] land and you come to a fence this is how
[2:03:35] you cross the fence well let me tell you
[2:03:37] how Farmers cross the fence we either
[2:03:41] take a stick and push the top wire or so
[2:03:43] low we crawl over or we put a foot on
[2:03:45] the third wire and pry it up till we can
[2:03:47] duck and go through it I like all of
[2:03:49] their etiquette that they have but if
[2:03:51] you're talking about a real farmer amen
[2:03:54] cuz I'll you know if if I tweak the
[2:03:56] fence I'll fix
[2:04:00] it I don't know if that was real to a
[2:04:02] lot of you people in the city
[2:04:04] here I don't know why I even said that
[2:04:06] cuz some of you just look at me blankly
[2:04:08] like Crossing
[2:04:11] fences uh our fences are all this tall
[2:04:13] and
[2:04:17] vinyl but let me tell you my brother and
[2:04:20] sister God would walk up to the fence of
[2:04:22] the word right Beyond the
[2:04:24] Veil he's not going to just say squeeze
[2:04:27] your way
[2:04:29] through
[2:04:33] no come on come over and see it from my
[2:04:37] point of view quit looking at it as a
[2:04:41] educated
[2:04:42] Christian and start looking at it as a
[2:04:45] holy ghost filed
[2:04:46] Christian and your view is going to be
[2:04:49] so different good in fact you're going
[2:04:52] to love the view so much you can't go
[2:04:56] back huh
[2:04:58] hallelujah amen is my craziness making
[2:05:00] any
[2:05:01] sense
[2:05:03] hallelujah amen
[2:05:07] what what's the mystery somebody know
[2:05:09] what the mystery
[2:05:12] is Christ in you
[2:05:17] am
[2:05:19] God Vindicated his message that don't
[2:05:21] mean it's in
[2:05:22] US you can listen to a tape and read a
[2:05:24] book every single day of your life
[2:05:26] doesn't mean this word is in you you can
[2:05:29] read the Bible I I met a man was telling
[2:05:32] me praise God how many times you read
[2:05:33] the Bible I said well I believe I read
[2:05:35] all of the Bible but I I read a little
[2:05:37] in Genesis and then I went to Revelation
[2:05:38] I come back to Leviticus and then I
[2:05:40] jumped over to
[2:05:41] acts that's no way to read the Bible
[2:05:44] I've read the Bible seven times cover to
[2:05:47] cover and if you
[2:05:53] ever okay I'll stick with my
[2:05:58] method CU my method which I believe was
[2:06:01] God's method not Paul to claim it God's
[2:06:03] method yes come over here and look at it
[2:06:07] from my point of
[2:06:11] view Beyond the
[2:06:13] Veil hallelujah amen once it was death
[2:06:17] to go now it's death not to
[2:06:21] Hallelujah I say it's time to step into
[2:06:24] the
[2:06:24] mystery amen my brother and sister I I
[2:06:27] really believe it amen I'll read the
[2:06:29] scripture we've already covered it
[2:06:30] Colossians 1:25 through 27 where I'm
[2:06:33] I've made a minister according to the
[2:06:34] dispensation of God which is given to me
[2:06:37] for you to fulfill the word of God even
[2:06:40] the mystery which hath been hid from
[2:06:43] ages and from generation but is now now
[2:06:49] now means next week
[2:06:53] right now M
[2:06:56] 1965 come on Saints God's talking
[2:06:59] personal to us this morning somebody
[2:07:02] needs to reach up and take a hold of
[2:07:04] this mystery that has now been made
[2:07:08] manifest to his Saints Lord here's my
[2:07:12] hands Lord fill them Here's My Heart
[2:07:15] Lord fill it here's my mind Lord fill it
[2:07:18] and amen if there's iniquity in my cup
[2:07:20] pour more righteousness in my cup let it
[2:07:23] overflow Lord let it Wash Me by the
[2:07:26] water of the word until I am a vessel of
[2:07:30] righteousness hallelujah praise the Lord
[2:07:33] hallelujah to whom God would make known
[2:07:36] what is the riches of the glory of this
[2:07:38] mystery among the
[2:07:41] Gentiles there's a mystery here
[2:07:44] Saints I know it's understated we're the
[2:07:47] bride of Christ and I don't want to be
[2:07:49] rude brother Steven was just sharing a
[2:07:51] little testimony with him in the back
[2:07:52] and sometimes you feel like your
[2:07:54] preaching can be a little sharp or a
[2:07:56] little
[2:07:57] pointed but remember we brought out a
[2:08:00] little
[2:08:02] bit we need to look at
[2:08:06] ourself we need to look at ourselves
[2:08:08] circumspectly we need
[2:08:10] to look with strong Vision
[2:08:15] yes is this mystery really revealed to
[2:08:17] me
[2:08:21] or do I just believe the
[2:08:27] message Brothers turn the heat up we
[2:08:30] dumped a little too much cold water on
[2:08:31] the
[2:08:33] church come on Saints I think as a
[2:08:35] minister it's a fair question do we just
[2:08:38] believe the
[2:08:40] message or do we see
[2:08:42] ourself in the mystery
[2:08:47] amen
[2:08:49] from 15 to my early
[2:08:54] 30s I've been called on this before and
[2:08:56] people say it can't be so but I do
[2:08:58] believe it can be so from 15 to my M
[2:09:02] early
[2:09:03] mid-30s I was a
[2:09:05] backsliding message
[2:09:10] hippie some of you'd be saying no sorry
[2:09:13] buddy you can't but no no if you would
[2:09:15] ask
[2:09:17] me about the time in my testimony the
[2:09:19] brother Ron got a hold to me one day
[2:09:21] outside of church and said you need to
[2:09:23] quit fooling around and get serious
[2:09:24] about serving
[2:09:26] God I had hair that if it hadn't been
[2:09:28] stuck down with that whatever
[2:09:31] gel would have easily rubbed my collars
[2:09:33] and hung down to my
[2:09:36] nose yeah and if you'd have cornered me
[2:09:39] on the on the job I was living in
[2:09:42] Colorado hanging drywall and somebody
[2:09:44] had say something about God and I'd tell
[2:09:46] them buddy you got it wrong that's
[2:09:48] pretty hypocritical right when you don't
[2:09:50] live it but you got an
[2:09:53] opinion this is what God
[2:09:55] said
[2:09:58] wow and for a moment let me get my hair
[2:10:01] out of my
[2:10:02] eyes so I could show you right here in
[2:10:05] my Bible that I have in my work bag my
[2:10:08] tool
[2:10:09] bag I think you can be a
[2:10:13] backslid message

[2:10:25] me no all I need is a
[2:10:28] haircut and I'm

[2:10:39] yeah come on come on let's get in the
[2:10:40] mystery brother and sister let's step

[2:10:46] see who we really are amen man allow him
[2:10:49] to draw you in and see it from his
[2:10:51] perspective was that too strong okay I I

[2:10:57] rude but we do have to make a
[2:10:59] point you see my brother and sister we
