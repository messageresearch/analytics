[56:01] different countries Canada Poland from
[56:04] the
[56:05] African here we are in the United States
[56:08] but Lord this is a message that has gone

[57:21] for the season from Bethlehem that would
[57:24] satisfy every single heart from the
[57:27] youngest to the oldest Lord don't let us

[1:00:47] in uh Thunderbird hospital we were able
[1:00:50] to go back to where my daughter was born
[1:00:53] in 199 98 so actually it's been a little
[1:00:56] longer I don't know if it's old age on
[1:00:57] all of us but it was 97 to 2000 when we
[1:01:02] lived here don't try to think about that
[1:01:05] amen that was another generation ago so
[1:01:09] I just wanted to let you know the the
[1:01:11] family as well and by the grace of God
[1:01:15] and um also since we've ministered for
[1:01:17] you just over uh two years ago the Lord
[1:01:21] uh laid it on our hearts to open a
[1:01:23] little church there in our area and we
[1:01:26] started in a community center uh this is
[1:01:29] the community center that we were for 20
[1:01:31] months and then we move the lord gave us
[1:01:33] another church building in Bellingham
[1:01:35] Washington end time message
[1:01:37] Tabernacle that uh we're just renting
[1:01:40] right now and we're just so thankful to
[1:01:41] the Lord isn't his L the Lord good to
[1:01:45] just meet the Cry of every area every
[1:01:48] place that would be brother brandham
[1:01:50] wished there was uh churches on every
[1:01:52] corner and I just pray that that we
[1:01:54] would have the spirit sometimes as our
[1:01:56] Prophet you know to uh be able to have
[1:01:59] that kind of attitude and wherever
[1:02:01] you're live or locally that God would
[1:02:03] give you a blessing well there's a lot
[1:02:05] we of things we could say or preach on
[1:02:07] we just have one service but the Lord
[1:02:09] laid something on our hearts today to
[1:02:11] speak and I'd like to speak on
[1:02:14] Lord restore the freshness
[1:02:17] amen and it's not a it's not a
[1:02:20] demand of
[1:02:23] God lord
[1:02:25] restore it's not us demanding God it is
[1:02:28] it's expressing a desire of the heart
[1:02:31] it's a prayer so forgive me but I'm
[1:02:34] actually our title is a prayer Lord
[1:02:38] restore the
[1:02:39] freshness it's a thirsty cry for more of
[1:02:42] him amen so I I believe the brothers put
[1:02:45] up the scriptures so but we're going to
[1:02:47] be reading in 2 Samuel 23 and then also
[1:02:51] 1 chonicles 11 so to two places in the
[1:02:55] Bible maybe we could stand go ahead
[1:02:57] Brothers if you'd like to turn to that 2
[1:03:00] Samuel chapter
[1:03:03] 23 and um you've helped me feel at home
[1:03:06] so I can feel relaxed
[1:03:09] today
[1:03:11] amen some of these thoughts that we're
[1:03:14] going to be taking are out of uh at
[1:03:16] least five messages of brother brandham
[1:03:18] you'll remember why little
[1:03:21] Bethlehem and then he spoke it again he
[1:03:23] spoke it in 19 1958 then 1963 why little
[1:03:26] Bethlehem then God's gifts always find
[1:03:28] their places there is a man here that
[1:03:31] can turn on the light we have seen his
[1:03:33] star and have come to worship him we
[1:03:35] want to take our
[1:03:36] inspiration from the prophet and then go
[1:03:39] right into this morning we're going to
[1:03:40] jump right into it after the scripture
[1:03:42] she'll be ready for that in 2 Samuel
[1:03:46] chapter
[1:03:47] 23 you can see in verse one these are
[1:03:49] some of the last words of David he is
[1:03:52] remembering these times in verse 8 it
[1:03:55] speaks about the mighty men that David
[1:03:59] had but we're going to slip down to
[1:04:01] verse 13 and three of the 30 Chief went
[1:04:05] down and came to David in the Harvest
[1:04:07] Time unto the cave of aelm and the troop
[1:04:11] of the Philistines pitched in the valley
[1:04:13] of refraim and David was then in an hold
[1:04:16] and the Garrison of the Philistines was
[1:04:19] then in Bethlehem can we all say
[1:04:22] Bethlehem Bethlehem and David longed
[1:04:26] this this verse is on the screen David
[1:04:30] longed and said oh in my Bible there's
[1:04:34] an exclamation mark what about your
[1:04:36] Bible David longed and said oh that one
[1:04:39] would give me drink of the water of The
[1:04:41] Well of Bethlehem which is by the gate
[1:04:44] and the three Mighty Men break through
[1:04:46] the host of the Philistines and Drew
[1:04:49] water out of the well of Bethlehem that
[1:04:51] was by the gate and took it and brought
[1:04:53] it to David
[1:04:54] nevertheless he would not drink thereof
[1:04:57] but poured it out unto the Lord unto the
[1:05:01] Lord amen and he said be it far from me
[1:05:04] oh Lord that I should do this is not
[1:05:06] this the blood of the men that went in
[1:05:09] Jeopardy of their lives it wasn't
[1:05:11] natural blood David was looking beyond
[1:05:14] the Flesh of the people around him he
[1:05:17] was looking that how they are responding
[1:05:19] to the word was their Revelation it was
[1:05:23] their blood it was their life and we are
[1:05:26] pouring out our life every day is US
[1:05:29] expressing what we think of him amen but
[1:05:32] when David expressed this he saw that
[1:05:35] these men have been in Jeopardy of their
[1:05:37] lives therefore he would not drink
[1:05:40] it these things did these three Mighty
[1:05:45] Men let's go to the next scripture if we
[1:05:49] can in 1
[1:05:51] chonicles
[1:05:52] 11 out of out of the mouth of two or
[1:05:55] three
[1:05:57] Witnesses let these things be
[1:06:01] established Lord restore the
[1:06:05] freshness verse 1 chonicles
[1:06:12] 11 verse 16 you can see in verse 10 down
[1:06:17] to 17 as these Mighty Men some of their
[1:06:21] names are
[1:06:23] mentioned
[1:06:26] look at verse 15 now three of the 30
[1:06:29] captains went down to the Rock to David
[1:06:32] so there were three of these men that
[1:06:34] were around David in the in the cave
[1:06:36] there and ageline and the Philistines
[1:06:38] were around verse 16 and David was then
[1:06:41] in the
[1:06:42] hold and the Philistines Garrison was
[1:06:45] then at
[1:06:49] Bethlehem and David
[1:06:52] longed with strong
[1:06:55] desire and said oh that one would give
[1:06:58] me drink of the water of The Well of
[1:07:02] Bethlehem that is at the
[1:07:04] gate and the three break through the
[1:07:08] host of the Philistines and Drew water
[1:07:10] out of the well of
[1:07:12] Bethlehem that was by the gate and took
[1:07:15] it and brought it to David did David
[1:07:17] take the water and drink it and just
[1:07:20] satisfy himself no did he satisfy y his
[1:07:24] desires his natural
[1:07:26] desires no he looked beyond the water
[1:07:30] natural he said these brothers have a
[1:07:33] revelation and he poured it out on the
[1:07:38] ground sometimes you feel like your life
[1:07:41] is just being poured out on the
[1:07:44] ground the sands of time is swallowing
[1:07:47] up your life your energy your money your
[1:07:49] family what is
[1:07:52] happening David poured it out on the
[1:07:55] ground verse 19 is our last verse and he
[1:07:57] said my God forbid it me that I should
[1:08:00] do this thing shall I drink the blood of
[1:08:02] these men that have put their lives in
[1:08:04] Jeopardy for with the Jeopardy or the
[1:08:07] hazard of their lives they brought it
[1:08:10] therefore he would not drink it these
[1:08:13] things did these three mightiest God
[1:08:16] bless you you can have your
[1:08:22] seats
[1:08:29] David was
[1:08:33] frustrated that's what brother brandham
[1:08:35] said David and all his
[1:08:37] frustration he was walking back and
[1:08:41] forth it was a hot
[1:08:45] day why is it so hot he wasn't on the
[1:08:49] throne he wasn't in an air conditioned
[1:08:51] place he was out running for his life
[1:08:55] life the people in the message had uh
[1:08:58] misunderstood him he was the anointed
[1:09:01] king amen and what was going through his
[1:09:04] mind is after all of
[1:09:07] this and he was
[1:09:10] frustrated it was
[1:09:12] hot Saul was after him there were armies
[1:09:15] everywhere and he's sitting in the mouth
[1:09:18] of a
[1:09:20] cave the anointing oil was on him
[1:09:25] and he was thinking how could it be God
[1:09:28] how can all of this be in my
[1:09:33] life he said oh I wish I could have a
[1:09:37] drink have you ever been
[1:09:41] thirsty have you ever been
[1:09:44] hungry have you ever had something
[1:09:46] inside of you that was looking beyond
[1:09:48] the now and looking Beyond around you no
[1:09:51] matter how good you have but you just
[1:09:53] wanted something that was
[1:09:55] [Applause]
[1:09:56] fresh David was like that I wish I had a
[1:10:00] drink and his mind begin to go back to
[1:10:03] the gates of
[1:10:04] Bethlehem where there was a well
[1:10:08] right there was just nothing like that
[1:10:11] water that was in Bethlehem remember
[1:10:14] Bethlehem was the house of God's
[1:10:17] bread Christ is Bethlehem brother
[1:10:21] brandham said bethl bethl House of God's
[1:10:25] bread and we see the bread of life came
[1:10:28] out of Bethlehem it was the house of
[1:10:30] God's bread but Bethlehem was also the
[1:10:32] water seat of that whole province in
[1:10:34] that area there's no water like
[1:10:37] Bethlehem had and David used to take his
[1:10:41] Sheep by that well so he knew the waters
[1:10:44] were sweet good and I pray God today God
[1:10:49] restore some sweetness back into our
[1:10:51] lives Lord restore the
[1:10:55] freshness D David like any real
[1:10:58] leader is around sheep and they have a
[1:11:01] burden for the Sheep they've got to be
[1:11:03] fed good they've got to have good water
[1:11:06] not getting in a rut and just getting
[1:11:09] into a place of a form that didn't
[1:11:11] satisfy David David had
[1:11:15] water but there was no water like the
[1:11:17] Waters of
[1:11:19] Bethlehem
[1:11:20] remember it was his soul that was crying
[1:11:24] for a drink of that water he wanted
[1:11:27] something specific and he started to
[1:11:30] remember the days when he could drink of
[1:11:33] these Waters and and you know as we
[1:11:35] bring it up till today let's just bring
[1:11:37] it right up till today Jesus Christ is
[1:11:40] not satisfied with the denominational
[1:11:43] stagnated Waters of Leo DEA a lot of
[1:11:47] churches in Phoenix today that have
[1:11:49] their music have their services have
[1:11:51] their programs and I'll just be honest
[1:11:54] with you God is sick of it it stuffs him
[1:11:58] up it's it's just stagnated
[1:12:01] Waters but I wonder if sometimes even
[1:12:03] within the message we've allowed the
[1:12:06] freshness to seep
[1:12:08] out we've allowed our hearts to get
[1:12:10] caught up in a lot of other things and
[1:12:13] the sweetness leaves and we get in a dry
[1:12:16] place and we start to remember the times
[1:12:19] when that love and God's presence was
[1:12:22] near
[1:12:24] amen and I say God bring back that new
[1:12:27] again to all of us I'm speaking to the
[1:12:29] young and I'm speaking to the old Lord
[1:12:32] restore the
[1:12:33] freshness restore means to bring it back
[1:12:36] it it infers that you had something
[1:12:39] before but some of it has seeped out
[1:12:42] maybe it's gone somewhere but you as a
[1:12:45] Believer are just like David I'm longing
[1:12:48] I'm
[1:12:50] thirsty to see Jesus back again
[1:12:54] amen amen a real worship something that
[1:12:59] is from the genuine heart where God can
[1:13:02] pour himself in where the word can live
[1:13:05] in our
[1:13:07] day I'm going to just have our liberties
[1:13:10] today I I believe brother Ron give that
[1:13:12] to us today I want to focus on two
[1:13:15] specific areas number one it's God's
[1:13:18] desire for a fresh drink just forget
[1:13:22] about yourself just you know we can
[1:13:23] become selfish that's right we come into
[1:13:26] church we go to a meeting we around
[1:13:28] people we get so selfish let's focus on
[1:13:31] the main thing God deserves a fresh
[1:13:35] drink
[1:13:36] today I think I got about half of you
[1:13:39] with me today God deserves a fresh
[1:13:44] drink he deserves to have people that
[1:13:48] are connected to him that are engaged to
[1:13:50] him that are looking to him today
[1:13:54] but number two is we're Believers you
[1:13:57] and I have a desire for a fresh
[1:14:00] drink something cool something that is
[1:14:03] good and refreshing some Waters that are
[1:14:06] clear that meets The
[1:14:09] Thirst not stagnated not corrupted
[1:14:13] something clean something
[1:14:15] refreshing something that will renew the
[1:14:18] heart of God and flow back to us and
[1:14:21] we'll satisfy I just want to say the
[1:14:23] last time I saw you was last year in
[1:14:27] 2023 and you finished strong and you're
[1:14:30] here today this is 20 24 already one
[1:14:33] month's already gone
[1:14:35] by I want to say this is the year right
[1:14:38] now to grab a hold of this we don't have
[1:14:41] 2023
[1:14:43] anymore there is no other year before us
[1:14:46] in the past that we can just all be
[1:14:49] clawing back for memories that will
[1:14:51] satisfy us this is a new year and in the
[1:14:55] the future is unknown we're not even
[1:14:57] promised another breath or another
[1:14:59] baptism this afternoon we have
[1:15:02] today how many want to give him a fresh
[1:15:05] drink today amen remember these three
[1:15:08] men were around David they weren't far
[1:15:12] away they they weren't like some distant
[1:15:15] place they were around and I want to be
[1:15:17] around where the word is I I want to
[1:15:19] hear that still Small Voice Lord please
[1:15:22] position my life where I can hear your
[1:15:25] will and your
[1:15:26] desires and David did not turn and
[1:15:29] command these men and say I want you I
[1:15:32] he did not speak like that he was
[1:15:34] expressing his desire he was just
[1:15:37] speaking from his heart but these three
[1:15:39] men were Mighty Men and they were
[1:15:42] Gentiles but they saw him on his way to
[1:15:45] the throne he wasn't on the throne it
[1:15:49] wasn't beautiful it wasn't nice it
[1:15:51] wasn't always good times
[1:15:54] but they saw it was Christ in
[1:15:57] David how many know that it was David
[1:16:00] was a fugitive from his own
[1:16:03] people Christ was a fugitive from his
[1:16:06] own people Amen in our day Revelations 3
[1:16:11] in the church age that we're living in
[1:16:13] he was on the outside he was a fugitive
[1:16:16] from his own people I believe all of you
[1:16:19] believe that but let's come right into
[1:16:21] the message today right where we're
[1:16:24] living there's Warriors
[1:16:26] today where Jesus desires a he's still a
[1:16:30] fugitive even amongst his own people
[1:16:33] often times he can be so far
[1:16:37] away and I say God bring those Desires
[1:16:40] close again bring your presence down
[1:16:42] real again Lord and we're talking also
[1:16:45] about our new generation that there
[1:16:47] deserves a chance at the word and they
[1:16:50] deserve to have the Holy Spirit in our
[1:16:52] meetings and in in our families in our
[1:16:54] relationships please give them a chance
[1:16:58] an opportunity to receive the
[1:17:00] [Applause]
[1:17:04] Lord Lord restore the
[1:17:09] freshness Lord bring it back again Lord
[1:17:12] I'm speaking earnestly but sincerely
[1:17:15] that God give that to every single one
[1:17:17] of you today maybe somebody that's
[1:17:21] streaming whether locally
[1:17:23] or wherever they're at the Lord can just
[1:17:25] come right where they're at and restore
[1:17:28] it right there where they're at God's a
[1:17:30] god of Miracles he can change a nature
[1:17:33] he can change a heart friends don't put
[1:17:35] anyone out too far they might be the
[1:17:37] last one you might be the last one that
[1:17:40] needs to come to
[1:17:42] Perfection take the word of God today
[1:17:45] there is a faith for this generation
[1:17:48] that's been anointed by a prophet has
[1:17:50] anointed this this generation the Lord
[1:17:53] Lord Jesus has anointed this
[1:18:00] generation I want to take you back even
[1:18:02] individuals today in your memory and in
[1:18:04] your past I see a lot of Elders and
[1:18:07] older ones
[1:18:09] here I heard brother Ron last Sunday
[1:18:12] mentioned his testimony sister sy's
[1:18:15] testimony and where they came
[1:18:18] from my wife sister Sharon is here and
[1:18:21] she was raised in Australia her father
[1:18:23] is a pastor of the
[1:18:26] message raised in the message from a
[1:18:28] little
[1:18:30] girl but it wasn't until a teenager when
[1:18:34] there was some meetings and the
[1:18:36] freshness of the message came by her way
[1:18:38] and she gave her heart to Christ and she
[1:18:41] God filled her with the Holy Spirit we
[1:18:44] believe in that today don't we it can
[1:18:46] happen right here today someone the Holy
[1:18:48] Spirit just falls on them could be in
[1:18:50] the nursery right now come
[1:18:55] on I want to go back with you just for a
[1:18:57] few moments in our own lives where we
[1:19:00] were raised born and raised in the Bram
[1:19:02] Tabernacle I'm speaking today about Lord
[1:19:05] restore the
[1:19:07] freshness we were raised with people
[1:19:10] that would stand for
[1:19:13] hours in
[1:19:16] lines as it was in brother bram's day
[1:19:19] but it wasn't when brother John was
[1:19:20] being raised up and they'd have special
[1:19:22] meeting there was two doors in in the in
[1:19:25] the back one in the front one on each
[1:19:28] side and there would be lines for hours
[1:19:30] long lines and when they open the doors
[1:19:33] within 60
[1:19:35] seconds that whole building was packed
[1:19:38] and they waited and they
[1:19:40] waited and they waited to hear maybe a
[1:19:43] tape maybe a
[1:19:45] message I remember the park V Junia High
[1:19:49] School where they'd have special
[1:19:51] meetings and thousands of message
[1:19:54] Believers that love the message they
[1:19:56] would brother bradam spoke their
[1:19:58] marriage and divorce and he spoke
[1:20:00] looking at a curtain and on this side
[1:20:02] was an auditorium that was just packed
[1:20:05] full of people and on this side there
[1:20:06] was a whole gymnasium with bleachers and
[1:20:09] chairs and they would just pack out that
[1:20:13] building when brother John was raised up
[1:20:14] at Easter meetings they would rent the
[1:20:17] same place and they would just pack out
[1:20:19] this for a whole weekend and hear
[1:20:21] messages remember those
[1:20:25] days I remember youth camps as a young
[1:20:28] boy I was just sharing with a couple of
[1:20:30] the brothers locally on Friday night how
[1:20:33] we were raised were young men and young
[1:20:35] ladies that are now leaders in the
[1:20:38] message that they were on the they were
[1:20:41] receiving the Holy Spirit and God was
[1:20:42] being poured out on their lives genuine
[1:20:45] Holy Ghost camp meetings not just a lot
[1:20:48] of running and screaming for the moment
[1:20:50] but like it was an experience that kep
[1:20:52] married them Monday Tuesday it was like
[1:20:55] the message was being poured out and
[1:20:57] what we saw not not just on the day of
[1:20:59] Pentecost but through brother bram's
[1:21:01] Ministry that could bring you from a new
[1:21:03] birth all the way through to adoption
[1:21:06] and maturity it was
[1:21:08] happening
[1:21:11] Hallelujah I remember days when fathers
[1:21:15] and mothers and families they were
[1:21:17] burdened for the
[1:21:19] word I remember the days when young men
[1:21:22] and young women would move across the
[1:21:24] oceans move across the the states or
[1:21:28] provinces or countries but they move for
[1:21:31] the word of God it wasn't for a job or
[1:21:34] because of family or finances it was for
[1:21:37] the word I remember when families were
[1:21:40] moved by the
[1:21:42] word yes sir I remember years ago when
[1:21:48] desires for people is this okay today
[1:21:51] speaking about Lord restore the
[1:21:53] freshness yes I remember people would
[1:21:56] linger for hours in the presence of the
[1:21:58] Lord longing they were loving they were
[1:22:01] craving they just wanted
[1:22:05] God I remember the days when people love
[1:22:09] the
[1:22:11] message they love the
[1:22:15] ministry they love
[1:22:18] church they love the house of God it
[1:22:22] wasn't cuz it was convenient but they
[1:22:24] loved it I remember when they loved to
[1:22:27] sing
[1:22:31] songs I remember they love Fellowship
[1:22:34] you couldn't hardly break them up from
[1:22:36] one another hardly they had brotherly
[1:22:38] kindness they long to get together I
[1:22:40] remember when the presence of God being
[1:22:42] so strong and so powerful in meetings
[1:22:45] when it was just a heartache they just
[1:22:47] wanted to see more of God I've got to
[1:22:49] have God I've got to get to Jesus they
[1:22:53] would run they would stand up and run in
[1:22:55] a
[1:22:56] service I remember preaching in New
[1:22:58] Zealand one time and and it was in a
[1:23:01] place a sheep farm and it it was 100% of
[1:23:04] the people in that building we we ended
[1:23:06] up at the altar I remember that brother
[1:23:08] Ron it was a place where God was just
[1:23:10] moving God's spirit was moving
[1:23:16] sovereignly people had a strong will to
[1:23:18] serve Christ that Holiness was the
[1:23:21] standard Jesus Christ was the
[1:23:25] head as I begin to just sit and Ponder
[1:23:29] as maybe Mary pondered and meditated
[1:23:31] about these things and think I begin to
[1:23:33] ask the question will we ever see those
[1:23:35] days
[1:23:37] again or will it just grow continually
[1:23:40] worse will lukewarmness continue to grip
[1:23:44] the throats of even Believers and caner
[1:23:47] their lives their breath becomes stale
[1:23:49] their hunger becomes the cry for the
[1:23:51] spirit is just hardly uh you know very
[1:23:54] anymore it's like a lot of other things
[1:23:56] have taken
[1:23:57] over are people thirsty for the
[1:24:00] Supernatural and I say God today restore
[1:24:04] our first fresh desires
[1:24:08] again Bring Back Your word your breath
[1:24:12] of your word so that it'll satisfy this
[1:24:15] new generation that will bring them to a
[1:24:18] full birth that will bring our families
[1:24:21] back to that place again restore unto us
[1:24:25] all the years come on friends we get in
[1:24:28] a rut we get into a place where the
[1:24:30] message doesn't stir our hearts
[1:24:32] anymore where meetings just become so
[1:24:34] staged and so expected and this and that
[1:24:38] God Shake our worlds a little bit don't
[1:24:41] ever let us get so old and stagnated and
[1:24:44] in a form that it's got to be our way or
[1:24:47] the highway friends we got to get on
[1:24:49] God's
[1:24:51] way amen sir restore unto us if we've
[1:24:56] lost something in the battle please

[1:25:30] lot of things going it was a youth
[1:25:32] meeting where young people and a young
[1:25:35] lady stood up and said Lord Jesus I love
[1:25:37] you with all of my heart and a Welsh
[1:25:39] Revival started and a 100,000 Souls were
[1:25:43] won and I say God help us today with
[1:25:46] this glorious message amen
[1:25:50] hallelujah amen
[1:25:53] I hope this is
[1:25:54] okay give us gentle weeping again will
[1:25:59] people just seek
[1:26:02] him give us Ardent Faith
[1:26:06] Warriors that are resolved to follow and
[1:26:09] with a firm
[1:26:12] commitment cuz I I just speak a word of
[1:26:14] encouragement the more you feed from the
[1:26:17] world the more it dulls your spiritual
[1:26:20] being the more you neglect that
[1:26:23] spiritual hunger and the Pains of the
[1:26:25] word and satisfy those Godly thirsts
[1:26:28] with water with
[1:26:32] carnality you will more spiritually
[1:26:34] Decline and get worse and worse and I
[1:26:37] say God help us
[1:26:39] today give me a new
[1:26:41] [Applause]
[1:26:44] desire you can even create a new
[1:26:51] heart and give it back
[1:26:54] again a clean heart a right Spirit renew
[1:26:59] a right Spirit within
[1:27:01] me or are we just going to be satisfied
[1:27:05] with more
[1:27:06] ungodliness the more evil it just seems
[1:27:09] like people good people can get
[1:27:13] swallowed up and loosen standards just
[1:27:16] becomes positive where dullness is
[1:27:19] acceptable I'm looking at my notes my
[1:27:21] wife tells me not to but that's what the
[1:27:23] Lord laid on my heart so I'm trying to
[1:27:24] be very
[1:27:26] focused where people can condone
[1:27:30] sin because it's in our family or it's
[1:27:33] our
[1:27:35] church or it's my friend if it was
[1:27:38] another church my you'd be so quick if
[1:27:40] if it was another family you'd be so
[1:27:43] quick but because it's my friend my are
[1:27:46] you just kind of have another attitude
[1:27:49] people get cold and indifferent we get
[1:27:52] it's
[1:27:54] stale the danger is where that's becomes
[1:27:57] accept
[1:27:59] acceptable
[1:28:01] right and people actually begin to agree
[1:28:04] with
[1:28:05] backsliding There's No Cry for godliness
[1:28:08] no passion for him and David was seeing
[1:28:10] all of this and something be to cry out
[1:28:13] within him from his heart oh for some
[1:28:16] fresh waters again
[1:28:19] amen let's go back please to second
[1:28:22] Samuel if you have your Bibles and can
[1:28:24] turn back there again
[1:28:28] today M it's been a long time since
[1:28:31] we've been back and seen a lot of you we
[1:28:33] raised our children in the church for
[1:28:35] three wonderful years I don't regret it

[1:28:42] your heart to us we knelt down today my
[1:28:44] wife and I in prayer and I I was
[1:28:46] thanking the Lord for this church it's
[1:28:48] only because of you is why I'm standing
[1:28:50] here right now it's because of the love
[1:28:53] of the Lord Jesus you've opened up your
[1:28:55] heart I'm not taking advantage of of
[1:28:59] your invitation to say something
[1:29:01] inappropriate I'm taking the opportunity
[1:29:04] to encourage you God may we all walk out
[1:29:07] of here today with a a real fresh drink
[1:29:09] of God Upon Our Lives but may we also
[1:29:12] have something stirred within us to give
[1:29:14] you a fresh
[1:29:16] [Applause]
[1:29:17] drink can you say amen I mean what if
[1:29:20] somebody near you just God dealt with
[1:29:22] them today what if God stirred a family
[1:29:24] or stirred a heart a child a young
[1:29:26] person I remember growing up in the
[1:29:28] message for years it was like there was
[1:29:31] a lot of um mechanic swed into our lives
[1:29:35] but one day the dynamic
[1:29:37] struck and all those years it was like
[1:29:39] lighting
[1:29:41] fire and and it was just like something
[1:29:44] it just took all of those
[1:29:46] years don't be discouraged and weary
[1:29:49] with your life and I want to close with
[1:29:51] that today when when it seems like God
[1:29:53] is just pouring out your life and it's
[1:29:56] just going down into the sands of time
[1:29:58] and you feel is my life a waste come on
[1:30:01] now is being a Christian and all of your
[1:30:04] strength and now look at what's
[1:30:05] happening is it just a waste it's like
[1:30:11] seriously
[1:30:15] David let's look at it here remind you
[1:30:18] in 2 Samuel
[1:30:20] 23 I I'll REM remind you of verse 39
[1:30:23] remember Uriah the hittite was one of
[1:30:26] the these 30 remember Uriah was the
[1:30:29] husband of
[1:30:33] BBA right remember that remember it had
[1:30:39] to be baseba that brought forth the
[1:30:41] child
[1:30:44] Solomon it's not condoning what happened
[1:30:46] to get there or how it was but God's
[1:30:49] word is going to happen regardless and
[1:30:52] all the negatives that's happened in
[1:30:53] your life and in the message and around
[1:30:56] the world
[1:30:57] globally God's word will not return unto
[1:31:00] him void but it is accomplishing right
[1:31:03] here at the end time 2024 by restoring
[1:31:06] that freshness back
[1:31:08] [Applause]
[1:31:12] again he's still the mighty angel that
[1:31:16] can stand in any situation and he just
[1:31:18] takes control over every matter he knows
[1:31:22] the secrets of the
[1:31:23] heart still the same Lord Jesus that can
[1:31:26] say I forgive you I heal you thank you
[1:31:29] Lord I'm going to take all your sorrow
[1:31:31] and all your hurt I'm going to make you
[1:31:32] whole we're going to start on a journey
[1:31:34] we're going to get up on a road to
[1:31:36] recovery do you want to go there well
[1:31:38] Lord I don't I'm get up get up on the
[1:31:39] road to
[1:31:41] recovery let's go let's take a step
[1:31:43] let's move out
[1:31:46] there and David you can see him in 2
[1:31:50] Samuel 23
[1:31:52] uh uh verse 13 again as he was in this
[1:31:56] place David was in the hold and verse 14
[1:31:59] in verse 15 David longed and said oh
[1:32:02] that one would give me drink of the
[1:32:04] water of The Well of Bethlehem which is
[1:32:06] oh I just want to have something real
[1:32:08] and fresh and these three Mighty Men
[1:32:12] they heard
[1:32:14] that and they broke through all the
[1:32:19] unbelief that that was it a weekend
[1:32:22] Serv I don't know was it Friday to
[1:32:25] Monday and here it's Monday night and
[1:32:26] they're bringing it back 15
[1:32:29] miles just look it up it's it's seven 7
[1:32:32] and a half miles one way from adelon the
[1:32:35] cave to Bethlehem and then back again
[1:32:38] that's exactly what a prophet
[1:32:40] said wow it wasn't just a little five
[1:32:43] minute prayer and a little bit they they
[1:32:45] were anointed to go after this water and
[1:32:47] they di down into the well M was
[1:32:50] precious water we're taking this back to
[1:32:52] our
[1:32:54] King and somebody else said he's just a
[1:32:57] fugitive he's just frustrated he's just
[1:33:00] a frustrated person right now but these
[1:33:03] men were looking beyond all of that it
[1:33:05] was Christ in David they I'll give my
[1:33:08] life for
[1:33:11] Christ sir and you look down in these
[1:33:13] next verses they brought it back to
[1:33:15] David in verse 16 what did David
[1:33:19] do he poured it out on the ground
[1:33:24] forgive me for repeating but David
[1:33:26] didn't say that take that glass of water
[1:33:28] and say God bless you brothers and go
[1:33:30] back to your families and then go back
[1:33:33] there wow just what I wanted take that
[1:33:38] water and drink my I remember the days
[1:33:40] and now satisfy my natural thirst David
[1:33:43] didn't do that no real leader is out for
[1:33:46] just their carnal natural thirst David
[1:33:49] was looking beyond that and said my
[1:33:52] these men have caught the
[1:33:53] Revelation they've jeopardized their
[1:33:55] lives it's their blood of the I can't
[1:33:58] drink
[1:33:59] this
[1:34:01] right
[1:34:03] amen God help us not to be
[1:34:07] selfish I'll I'll say right here God
[1:34:09] help me not to be selfish it was Christ
[1:34:12] in David that said I'm going to pour
[1:34:13] this out on the
[1:34:15] ground SEC 1 chonicles 11 I know you've
[1:34:19] been there already but it's just good
[1:34:23] 1 chonicles 11 to see this out of the
[1:34:26] mouth of two or three Witnesses here it
[1:34:28] is almost repeated again in verse 17 and
[1:34:34] David
[1:34:39] longed I wonder where that as where
[1:34:43] that's at
[1:34:45] anymore people want
[1:34:47] money they want a house they got to have
[1:34:50] a certain this drink or this certain and
[1:34:53] they just long after something and if
[1:34:55] they don't get
[1:34:58] it and if they don't get it it's
[1:35:01] something driving them a
[1:35:04] thirst but David was longing he just
[1:35:10] longing said oh that one would give me
[1:35:12] drink of the water of The Well of
[1:35:14] Bethlehem that is at the gate and the
[1:35:17] three broke through the host of the
[1:35:18] Philistines and Drew water out of the
[1:35:20] well of bethle
[1:35:21] that was by the gate and took it and
[1:35:23] brought it to David but David would not
[1:35:25] drink it but poured it out to the Lord
[1:35:27] and said my God forbid it me that I
[1:35:30] should do this
[1:35:32] thing shall I drink the blood of these
[1:35:35] men that have put their lives in I'm
[1:35:36] laboring on this
[1:35:39] point it's the same Spirit of Christ
[1:35:41] that looks down this
[1:35:45] morning the almost this
[1:35:48] afternoon he said I wonder if there's
[1:35:51] someone someone in Phoenix that will
[1:35:53] give me a real fresh drink of water
[1:35:54] today I I wonder if there's any
[1:35:56] believers in Phoenix in the midst of all
[1:35:59] this Darkness I wonder if there's any
[1:36:01] light
[1:36:03] here that would even hear the voice of
[1:36:05] God that would even know the mind of the
[1:36:08] spirit on come on or are we already
[1:36:11] eating our dinner and drinking our you
[1:36:13] know drink our favorite drive-thru is
[1:36:15] already you can already sense that
[1:36:17] coming oh you just got to have that or
[1:36:19] fellowship or a love friend or this and
[1:36:20] that
[1:36:22] right people become
[1:36:25] miserable they become a c
[1:36:28] indifferent then it becomes an attitude
[1:36:31] in the family then it becomes an
[1:36:33] attitude in the church then we just
[1:36:35] become comfortable and it just hardly it
[1:36:38] just doesn't nothing moves me anymore
[1:36:40] brother John I just brother John I love
[1:36:43] the Lord but something's
[1:36:45] happened on the Lord has heard your
[1:36:50] cry and he's giving you a fresh drink
[1:36:53] today he he's he's swooping away all
[1:36:56] those those memories and the feelings
[1:36:58] and the things that actually
[1:37:00] happened and he's saying I'm here to
[1:37:02] give you something fresh and new oh
[1:37:05] saying new it's new doctor new this no
[1:37:07] people even in the message they want to
[1:37:08] run they want to shout they want to do
[1:37:10] this they want to do
[1:37:12] that even ministers they they want to
[1:37:15] get the the church all jumping and
[1:37:17] yelling and screaming and yet Monday and
[1:37:20] Tuesday God forgive me but that's not
[1:37:22] what's happening in their private prayer
[1:37:24] closets that's
[1:37:26] right why would we try to lead our young
[1:37:29] people to that kind of experience every
[1:37:31] service every Camp every meeting every's
[1:37:33] got to be this got to be this way and
[1:37:34] that way when Monday and Tuesday you're
[1:37:36] not like
[1:37:40] that why would we do that friends that's
[1:37:45] right God help us to find our
[1:37:49] place and to have the Holy Spirit bring
[1:37:52] a a balance to our lives amen bring back
[1:37:56] that freshness
[1:38:01] Lord let me just ask a personal question
[1:38:04] is it fine for our young people just to
[1:38:07] have an experience just like the Rich
[1:38:10] Young Ruler that they're really good and
[1:38:12] have all the the actions and the they
[1:38:14] can do this and be so good get all the
[1:38:16] stickers handle themselves so well and
[1:38:19] yet the end result was the young man
[1:38:21] crying out in
[1:38:25] hell I have no doubt about it that that
[1:38:27] Minister that took his service in the
[1:38:30] scripture brother brandham tied the Rich
[1:38:32] Young Ruler into that man that came to
[1:38:34] Jesus that had the attitude his business
[1:38:37] was growing he was building bigger Barns
[1:38:39] and all kinds of attitudes he had money
[1:38:41] he was doing good Commandments and Jesus
[1:38:43] loved
[1:38:47] him he loved
[1:38:50] him amen I just want to say something
[1:38:52] for about 90 seconds that might help an
[1:38:55] older person you know Jesus loved this
[1:38:57] person and yet that kind of love did not
[1:39:00] win that man's
[1:39:02] heart and sometimes
[1:39:05] we we can why isn't that person coming
[1:39:08] what my family this person in the church
[1:39:09] this coworker if we're not careful we
[1:39:12] we'll lapse into a place of condemning
[1:39:14] ourselves and walking with guilt I'm
[1:39:16] talking to older ones we look into the
[1:39:19] scripture like how Jesus handled the
[1:39:21] Rich Young Ruler is my 90 seconds about
[1:39:23] up and we got to realize that even the
[1:39:26] perfect love of Jesus could not win that
[1:39:29] man's heart you've got to commit that to
[1:39:32] God under the power of the token and say
[1:39:35] Lord I give that to
[1:39:37] [Applause]
[1:39:37] [Music]
[1:39:41] you I wonder sometimes if our pulpits
[1:39:44] have lost the vision and they've lost
[1:39:46] the way sometimes parents lose their
[1:39:49] Zeal sometimes even Grand parents lose
[1:39:51] their influence on their grandchildren
[1:39:54] and I wonder in the message not I'm not
[1:39:56] talking just locally here but
[1:39:58] globally what is our Revelation really
[1:40:03] produced that some of our young people
[1:40:05] could raise up so good so wonderful and
[1:40:08] like the Rich Young Ruler if they died
[1:40:11] we'd put them into heaven we'd put them
[1:40:12] into heaven I'm sure that priest did
[1:40:15] that day he he brought him into the
[1:40:17] Heavenly Gates he's given so much money
[1:40:19] he's been so good and brother Bram said
[1:40:21] that rich young ruler was down in
[1:40:24] Hell Jesus gave us that example he's
[1:40:27] down in
[1:40:32] hell you know brother bram's own family
[1:40:35] and children which I knew well brother
[1:40:37] Ron knew very well personally I did too
[1:40:40] we got to remember that our prophet's
[1:40:42] son he smoked he gambled he
[1:40:45] rebelled he even got engaged and went
[1:40:48] through a married situation which
[1:40:49] brother brandham did not support his own
[1:40:51] daughter was involved in rock and roll
[1:40:53] when she was a teenager after all these
[1:40:55] meetings brother brandham our Prophet
[1:40:58] tried to commit suicide not just once
[1:41:01] but
[1:41:02] twice what about our
[1:41:04] families and when the message was just
[1:41:07] coming out it was like oh when we all
[1:41:08] get to heaven that's a wave in the 70s
[1:41:11] and in the 80s now I'm bringing you
[1:41:12] through all of this in your mind through
[1:41:15] the 70s ' 80s '90s up in to it just
[1:41:18] seemed oh we're all going to serve God
[1:41:20] we're going and now you can see in
[1:41:22] families and in lives a family of five
[1:41:24] there might be three serving the
[1:41:27] lord there might be two serving the lord
[1:41:31] maybe and you I know of even pastors
[1:41:34] that have five children and all of them
[1:41:36] went to the world and you begin to think
[1:41:38] not in the message we would never talk
[1:41:40] about divorce or separation we would
[1:41:43] never talk about drugs or issues and but
[1:41:45] now as we've gone
[1:41:47] on don't get quiet on me friends I'm
[1:41:50] just saying what some of you maybe all
[1:41:51] of you thought at some point it's like
[1:41:54] [Music]
[1:41:58] really and if we're not careful we'll
[1:42:00] see all the drama in the message and all
[1:42:02] the drama in your personal life and then
[1:42:05] you'll drag that into your family and
[1:42:07] once you bust out of your room and get
[1:42:09] off your
[1:42:11] device and then you'll bring that drama
[1:42:14] to church and you want to drag your
[1:42:15] drama and your culture into church God
[1:42:18] forgive us Lord this is the House of
[1:42:22] God this is a place where we ought to
[1:42:25] come and let off the
[1:42:27] pressure this ought to be a safe
[1:42:31] place this ought to be a place where
[1:42:33] mental friends there's never like ever
[1:42:35] and brother John travels around the
[1:42:37] world there's more mental uh uh uh
[1:42:39] sickness and issues in the message than
[1:42:44] ever if we're not careful from the
[1:42:46] pulpit to the back we'll actually
[1:42:48] accentuate that and make it even worse
[1:42:52] and you have people that come to our
[1:42:53] meetings that just want a fresh drink of
[1:42:55] water I mean where are the days when the
[1:42:58] spirit just wash through the
[1:43:00] congregation and the peace of God just
[1:43:02] cover me
[1:43:05] Lord we're people that are broken and
[1:43:08] crushed and and just torn apart they can
[1:43:10] be
[1:43:11] healed where are those days
[1:43:15] again amen there ought to be a cry in
[1:43:17] all of our hearts bring those days back
[1:43:19] again Lord Lord Jesus I've got a
[1:43:22] teenager I've got a grandson now or a
[1:43:24] granddaughter there's people you can see
[1:43:27] there they need the Lord in their they
[1:43:29] need more than
[1:43:30] Church come on Friends our own Prophet
[1:43:33] had that question are we getting them to
[1:43:36] Christ don't be offended when the
[1:43:39] ministry starts coming down home to you
[1:43:42] and you start asking well where's he
[1:43:43] coming from where's he G stepping on my
[1:43:45] toes well friends we need more of that
[1:43:47] in our lives Church ought to be a
[1:43:49] hospital place

[1:43:53] the secret
[1:43:54] places we're not running and hiding but
[1:43:57] I can run in there I want to run into
[1:44:00] his presence and be
[1:44:02] saved Deliver Me From
[1:44:05] [Applause]

[1:44:14] over the place come on friends we need
[1:44:16] men and women that have God that can

[1:44:44] he was thinking on these things it must
[1:44:46] have been a hot day he got thirsty hot
[1:44:48] and sweating could have looked way down
[1:44:49] in the valley from the top of the
[1:44:51] mountains on the east side of the West
[1:44:53] side and talking about this city look
[1:44:55] down and seeing where the Philistines
[1:44:56] all down there thousands of them
[1:44:58] garrisoned around he seen that old well

[1:45:02] brother John went back I was just
[1:45:05] triggering I remember I remember I
[1:45:09] remember I
[1:45:10] remember he begin to think of a morning
[1:45:13] when he take his sheep and go out to
[1:45:14] feed him he would pass by this old well
[1:45:16] because it was a great place of
[1:45:19] water then he'd go there and he would
[1:45:21] drink water and drink and let his sheep
[1:45:23] drink and there at Bethlehem where he
[1:45:25] watered his
[1:45:29] sheep

[1:45:48] we're already trying to work through all
[1:45:49] of this what happen happen in our

[1:47:07] pastor my grandpa and Grandma's there
[1:47:09] and my friends here and friends we need
[1:47:11] more than that we need the house of God
[1:47:13] to be a place that God can do surgeries

[1:47:29] brandham say for a cool fresh water lord
[1:47:34] bring it back to us this
[1:47:37] year I begin to get concerned when I was
[1:47:40] thinking about this and
[1:47:43] burdened I think Real Men of God think
[1:47:45] about these
[1:47:47] things begin to think about our father
[1:47:50] fathers and our mothers can I go a
[1:47:51] little further I'm speaking about
[1:47:54] restoring the freshness where even our
[1:47:56] mothers have we become more
[1:48:00] spiritual over the years since the
[1:48:03] popularity of and advancement of of
[1:48:06] electronic devices has that that tree of
[1:48:09] knowledge now that it's got closer but
[1:48:12] is the Tree of Life still blooming in
[1:48:14] our garden in our lives is the word
[1:48:17] still the main thing amen do I have a
[1:48:20] right to ask that question what about
[1:48:23] our elders are we are they more filled
[1:48:26] with the love of
[1:48:29] God than
[1:48:32] politics news articles
[1:48:35] yes financial affairs can can fill up a
[1:48:40] young man's heart they get married and
[1:48:42] have children and more and then
[1:48:43] financial affairs our family issues
[1:48:47] clouding are are somehow got in between
[1:48:50] between our health concerns now that
[1:48:52] we've got older our fellowship used to
[1:48:54] be so Ardent about the Lord and what the
[1:48:56] Lord's doing and brother yes what about

[1:49:01] older it's our health
[1:49:08] concerns they Cloud our minds business

[1:54:36] then that these Warriors grabbed them
[1:54:37] swords and David cried out for a fresh
[1:54:40] drink of water and they cut their way
[1:54:42] through 15 miles of men to get him a
[1:54:45] drink of water and David poured it out
[1:54:47] upon the ground as a
[1:54:48] sacrifice

[1:55:53] stand by this complex I'm going to stand
[1:55:55] by this that happened in the church I'm
[1:55:56] going to stand by this issue shame on
[1:56:00] you above all of that you've been
[1:56:02] commissioned yes sir commissioned by the
[1:56:05] word to bring Jesus a fresh
[1:56:08] drink I would encourage you to Wade

[1:56:49] need need you I need
[1:56:56] you so now I I really got to have
[1:57:00] everyone's attention to catch this when
[1:57:03] these brothers came back to
[1:57:11] David I'm just going to ask you for a
[1:57:13] moment about their
[1:57:15] attitude
[1:57:18] because
[1:57:20] when David poured this water out on the
[1:57:26] ground I wonder what their posture
[1:57:30] was are you
[1:57:36] serious do you think it was like
[1:57:42] this do you think it was like
[1:57:45] that what do you think their attitude
[1:57:48] was when David took it's our Blood Sweat
[1:57:50] and Tears it's our
[1:57:56] finances why did David pour it out on
[1:57:59] the
[1:58:02] ground if some of you could see this
[1:58:04] today it would help you this
[1:58:06] afternoon David actually poured out that
[1:58:09] water on the ground because he had a
[1:58:11] revelation that what these men were
[1:58:14] doing was something greater than just
[1:58:16] water I don't need this water David
[1:58:18] wanted that water but when he saw the
[1:58:22] character I said
[1:58:24] [Applause]
[1:58:29] character I can't drink this water these
[1:58:32] men have jeopardized their families
[1:58:33] they've their wives and
[1:58:36] children let let me ask you again in
[1:58:39] another way how do you think they gave
[1:58:42] this water to David do you just think
[1:58:43] they came in there and kind of threw it
[1:58:45] at them and say I got to go to my family
[1:58:47] man bless God I gave my family here here
[1:58:53] David do you think they were just kind
[1:58:55] of hasty like that and and and just
[1:58:57] rushed in and made it real
[1:59:00] quick when David poured it out on the
[1:59:02] ground did they just stand there in
[1:59:05] shock did they huff and puff like a lot
[1:59:08] of people do today and get
[1:59:11] disgusted I've give three years of my
[1:59:14] I've gave you this and that did you do
[1:59:17] it as unto the Lord
[1:59:21] [Applause]
[1:59:28] let me ask you this did they feel like
[1:59:31] David disrespected
[1:59:33] them David I gave up all of my time I
[1:59:36] could have been
[1:59:38] killed you're not even thinking about my
[1:59:41] wife my teenagers my little children
[1:59:44] you're poured it out on the
[1:59:47] ground he didn't acknowledge their
[1:59:50] sacrifice you're saying David you don't
[1:59:51] even my
[1:59:54] labors were they unhappy did they put on
[1:59:57] a nice face VOR David see and then walk
[1:59:59] out and say are you serious I'm leaving
[2:00:02] him you see what he
[2:00:04] did after all that we
[2:00:08] did what a
[2:00:14] waste the Lord laid this on my heart
[2:00:16] today to say bring back the freshness
[2:00:19] Lord amen I'm talking about our thoughts
[2:00:23] and our attitude how we're living as
[2:00:26] Believers how our service to the Lord
[2:00:28] that the Lord restore the
[2:00:33] freshness because our attitude I have it
[2:00:36] right in front of me and and why it had
[2:00:37] to be Shepherds brother you wonder what
[2:00:39] what you would have done back then or
[2:00:40] Noah's day brother brandham said you
[2:00:42] want to know what you would have done
[2:00:44] then look at your present State now and
[2:00:46] you can see what you would have done
[2:00:48] then cuz it certainly is
[2:00:50] revealing it is revealing what people do
[2:00:56] yes God raised up a generation where it
[2:01:00] really doesn't matter what goes on down
[2:01:02] here I'm going to serve the Lord as for
[2:01:05] me in my house don't make that a verse
[2:01:06] in the Bible make that a real Revelation
[2:01:09] it's like honey let we don't understand
[2:01:11] all things I can't put it all the blocks
[2:01:14] together but often times we need the
[2:01:16] Lord to disf fragment our minds our puny
[2:01:19] little Minds we get it all worked out
[2:01:21] and something's done different we get
[2:01:23] all huffy huffy and
[2:01:27] puppy and that's not fresh that's not
[2:01:31] sweet then we wonder why the blessing of
[2:01:33] God and we wonder why his spirit is
[2:01:35] grieved it's very simple friends we need
[2:01:38] a fresh
[2:01:39] [Applause]
[2:01:41] drink we just need to look at it all
[2:01:44] over again from another
[2:01:46] perspective someone to come in from the
[2:01:48] out outside
[2:01:50] maybe am I just need to hear it from
[2:01:52] another
[2:01:53] vessel another gift say the same thing
[2:01:57] say well bless God I don't receive
[2:01:59] nothing but my p i don't receive nothing
[2:02:01] but this certain evangelist we've had
[2:02:02] too much of that in the message and
[2:02:05] we've made them stars and heroes and as
[2:02:06] they've got older or passed away or
[2:02:08] maybe some fell
[2:02:10] away people went to the world well I'm
[2:02:13] leaving the mess I'm Le no no no you're
[2:02:15] leaving Christ and none of those people
[2:02:18] ever go on further with the Lord they
[2:02:20] they go down down their attitude their
[2:02:22] Spirit their family they get
[2:02:25] choked and I say God give me a fresh
[2:02:27] drink of my life I refuse to be a
[2:02:31] statistic for the
[2:02:32] devil I refuse to be a trophy on the
[2:02:36] devil's mental
[2:02:38] peace Hallelujah I refuse to be
[2:02:42] sour some of you that lean toward
[2:02:44] melancholiness and depression and
[2:02:46] darkness you need to rise up today and
[2:02:49] say I'm going to give Jesus a fresh
[2:02:51] drink of my
[2:02:53] life say I don't have a song in the
[2:02:56] night I'm in the night well the Lord can
[2:02:57] give you a
[2:02:58] song God can restore back to you all the
[2:03:01] years I'm speaking the word today to you
[2:03:04] God's given you a fresh
[2:03:07] [Applause]
[2:03:08] drink it's not more programs it's more
[2:03:11] of Jesus it's not more flesh and we
[2:03:14] don't need another rising star in the
[2:03:16] message we need Jesus to rise
[2:03:21] [Music]

[2:06:01] fresh water had been manifested in these
[2:06:04] brothers not the water it was their
[2:06:07] character and when he saw my I finally
[2:06:10] see the kind of character in my day I
[2:06:14] can pour out this water I don't need
[2:06:16] this water amen I'm he brushed off his
[2:06:20] brow and he said Thank You Lord I
[2:06:23] thought I needed a water from Bethlehem

[2:06:30] you throughout this service but God is
[2:06:31] looking at some of you today and you're
[2:06:34] looking at your life being poured out
[2:06:36] and your

[2:06:41] waste but David saw his
[2:06:44] desire and it stopped him from
[2:06:46] satisfying his own desire his f Focus
[2:06:49] shifted these men produced his desire
[2:06:52] not selfish not me focused cuz it was

[2:23:58] longing because he'd been there
[2:24:01] before to a
