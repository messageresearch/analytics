[32:25] and4 trust you're happy to be a
[32:27] Christian am happy to be in the house of
[32:30] the Lord
[32:35] amen Genesis 1 And1 it
[32:38] says in the beginning God created the
[32:40] Heaven and the
[32:42] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[32:45] void and darkness was upon the face of
[32:48] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[32:51] upon the face of the
[32:53] waters and God said let there be light
[32:57] and there was light
[32:59] and God saw the light that it was good
[33:03] and God divided the light from the
[33:08] darkness God saw the light that it was
[33:11] good and he divided the light from the
[33:14] darkness so what does that make
[33:19] darkness and God called the day the
[33:22] light day and the Darkness he called
[33:24] night and the evening and the morning
[33:26] were the first day
[33:28] now let's skip down to verse 14 and we
[33:31] know here in the second day he created
[33:33] the firmaments and and the third day he
[33:36] would separate the waters from dry land
[33:39] and Waters and he would create her herb
[33:44] yielding seeds and we see in chapter
[33:47] four
[33:48] here and God said let the lights in the
[33:52] firmament of the Heavens to divide the
[33:55] day from the night and let them be for
[33:59] signs for seasons and for days and years
[34:04] and something spoke to me and said what
[34:06] are those signs
[34:07] for there's not even a people yet upon
[34:10] the
[34:10] Earth but yet he said let these
[34:13] firmament be created for
[34:16] signs for seasons for years and for
[34:20] days and let them be for lights in the
[34:23] firmaments of the heaven to give light
[34:25] upon the Earth and it was so and God
[34:28] made two great
[34:30] lights the greater light to Rule the Day
[34:33] and the Lesser night to rule the
[34:35] night he made the Stars also so here he
[34:39] names the stars but as I begin to think
[34:42] to myself why didn't he say he created
[34:45] two lights the greater one he created
[34:47] the sun to Rule the Day and the moon to
[34:51] rule the
[34:52] night because in we would know in a
[34:55] symbolic form that God is talking about
[34:58] something
[34:59] greater there's something hidden
[35:04] there and God set them in the firmaments
[35:07] of the Heavens to give light upon the
[35:09] Earth and to rule over the day and over
[35:12] the night and to divide the light from
[35:15] darkness and God saw that it was good so
[35:19] God divided here completely the first
[35:21] time he divided light from
[35:24] Darkness completely but then Darkness
[35:28] he adds another form of light and
[35:31] separates it
[35:34] again so no matter what time day or
[35:38] night there's still light
[35:41] shining you can be seated tonight we're
[35:44] going to turn over to Isaiah 42 and
[35:47] verse
[35:49] 1 Isaiah 42 and verse
[35:55] one take this thank you
[36:01] behold my Ser servant whom I uphold mine
[36:04] elect and whom my soul delighteth I have
[36:07] put my spirit upon him and he shall
[36:09] bring forth judgment to the Gentiles he
[36:11] shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his
[36:14] voice to be heard in the streets a
[36:17] bruised Reed shall he not break and a
[36:19] smoked Flack shall he not quench he
[36:22] shall bring forth judgment unto truth
[36:25] and I begin to look at what is a bruised
[36:27] read and as you would know what a bruise
[36:28] is a brood is is an inward
[36:31] thing it's a bruised re an inward pain
[36:35] that is that it would be and a and he
[36:38] says here that it would be
[36:40] a a smoke flax as it was in back then in
[36:45] the oil
[36:46] lamps he wouldn't quench the fire from
[36:49] that wax as a as a fire would be B
[36:52] burning from a
[36:54] lamp and he says he shall not fail nor
[36:57] be discouraged till he set judgment in
[37:00] the earth and the owls shall wait for
[37:02] his
[37:03] laws thus saith God the Lord he that
[37:07] created the heavens and stretched them
[37:09] out and he that spread the forth the
[37:11] Earth and that which cometh out of it he
[37:15] giveth breath unto the people upon it
[37:17] and the spirit to them that walk therein
[37:22] so you see that the same God that
[37:23] created the heavens and the Earth the
[37:25] same God that said let there be light
[37:27] amen is the same God that gives not only
[37:31] the breath of life but he gives his
[37:34] Spirit into those that will that will
[37:37] walk
[37:38] therein and I the Lord have called thee
[37:41] in
[37:42] righteousness and will hold thy hand and
[37:44] will keep thee and give thee for a
[37:47] covenant of the people for a light of
[37:51] the Gentiles what was it for to open the
[37:55] blinded eyes to bring out to the prisons
[37:58] from those the prisoners from those in
[38:01] prison and them that sit in darkness out
[38:04] of the prison
[38:08] house as you see
[38:10] here them that sit in darkness outside
[38:13] of the prison house what is it people
[38:16] that sit in bondage you don't have to
[38:19] sit in some prison somewhere and be in
[38:22] bondage but many people come to church
[38:24] or they live their lives in in bondage
[38:27] Bound by something Bound by
[38:29] Darkness maybe Bound by a pain Bound by
[38:32] anxiety Bound by fear Bound by
[38:36] worry and yet they are
[38:42] bound brother Brandon would say that he
[38:45] he he would say that he's a
[38:47] typologist and he would begin to type
[38:50] things because there's patterns and
[38:52] there's seasons and God does things as
[38:55] types and shadows right the Bible says
[38:59] that there's nothing new Under the
[39:01] Sun you can't learn you know brother
[39:04] Brandon would begin to talk about
[39:06] Theology and learning it from schools
[39:08] and everything you know message
[39:10] preachers we're not going to learn it
[39:11] from those type of things but you know
[39:13] if we're not careful you know you begin
[39:15] to get on Google and you your Revelation
[39:17] becomes not only just preachers but
[39:19] message Believers of Googling this and
[39:22] Googling that and what is what does AI
[39:24] say about
[39:25] that I have a question let me type it in
[39:29] I have a question let me type it in to
[39:31] to Ai and try to get an
[39:35] answer what is it many times we fail to
[39:38] get on our knees and get a revelation
[39:40] from God something to minister to the
[39:44] people something to seek the mind of God
[39:48] for but it's so easy to get on and you
[39:51] can type in something into a into let's
[39:54] say even to the message what is the
[39:57] prophet say about
[39:59] this and you know what we try to do is
[40:02] we try and we get a thought from God and
[40:04] we study it out in his word because
[40:06] everything has to go back to his word
[40:08] and it has to line up to that Bible and
[40:11] we take it and we read it and we try to
[40:13] find this story aligns with that story
[40:15] and maybe God begins to unfold something
[40:17] in our own thinking and we begin to
[40:19] write it down and after it's put
[40:22] together what I do is I try to take it
[40:23] back to the message of the hour and find
[40:26] where does the Prophet say about it and
[40:28] the beautiful thing about it is if if
[40:30] it's a God and God is speaking and God
[40:34] wants to say something His prophets
[40:36] already said
[40:37] it there's nothing new there's no new
[40:41] revelation His prophets already brought
[40:43] it the light for this day has already
[40:46] been
[40:47] spoken why because it's the word for
[40:49] this
[40:51] hour so if we could take a thought this
[40:54] evening moved upon in an unexpected
[40:59] way moved upon in an unexpected way in a
[41:03] subject of separating light from
[41:06] Darkness brother brandham says in
[41:08] questions and answers 54 he says all
[41:10] things of types and shadows when God
[41:13] made the heavens and the Earth he made
[41:14] the moon to shine in the absence of the
[41:17] sun to give light while the sun was gone
[41:20] see a beautiful type of Christ in the
[41:23] church the church is the Moon to give
[41:26] light to the world while the the sun is
[41:28] gone see what I mean a lesser light amen
[41:31] he says then otherwise the moon and the
[41:33] sun is husband and wife and Christ in
[41:36] the church is husband and wife the wife
[41:39] being a weaker vessel only gives a
[41:41] smaller light in the absence of the
[41:44] husband being the weaker vessel is
[41:48] giving a a lesser light than that of the
[41:51] husband so why is is Satan so after this
[41:55] world and this generation a of equal
[42:01] rights females to have equal rights and
[42:04] equal power and all this why because
[42:07] they want their own power can you
[42:08] imagine if the Sun and the Moon begin to
[42:10] battle it out and the the moon said I I
[42:13] don't want to shine at night I want my
[42:15] time to be during the
[42:17] day what would happen to the
[42:22] orbit what would happen to Creation what
[42:25] would happen to the growth of your
[42:30] family the Moon being the weaker
[42:34] vessel and be in the Lesser light but
[42:37] yet she's still a reflection of her
[42:43] husband and the church can only make
[42:45] manifestations of the Holy Spirit and
[42:47] remember the moon cannot give any light
[42:50] of her
[42:51] own and when you see the Moonlight it
[42:53] cannot it's not the Moonlight it's it's
[42:56] the reflection of the sunlight and
[42:59] Christ ascended up is that right he says
[43:02] the Sun and shines his light on the
[43:05] church to reflect his light and power to
[43:08] the world in his absence so anything
[43:10] that we can do down here on Earth it has
[43:13] nothing to do with ourselves we have
[43:15] nothing to do with it all we are here is
[43:17] to reflect the Sun not the sunlight but
[43:20] the S so in the Son of God for our day
[43:25] and our hour
[43:27] yes just as a day of natural light we
[43:30] know the progression of light and the
[43:32] progression of light as it begins to
[43:34] start and it rises in the East and it
[43:36] begins to rise up it is not the Dead
[43:39] Heat of the
[43:40] day but as the sun begins to Peak up in
[43:43] the East and it begins to rise it is the
[43:46] warmth of the sunlight and Dew begins to
[43:50] Rise Up from the earth it is warming
[43:52] everything up to a certain
[43:55] temperature and as the day goes on it
[43:58] gets warmer and
[44:01] warmer what is happening it's the
[44:03] progression of the
[44:06] sunlight it is not hot from the very
[44:09] beginning it it Peaks its head
[44:11] over and as it begins to set it begins
[44:14] to cool
[44:16] off what is God showing us just as he
[44:20] created the heavens and the Earth and he
[44:22] began to create light from Darkness but
[44:25] in the beginning he just didn't
[44:27] Express and create light and everything
[44:29] that was light came to an existence but
[44:33] he shows us a
[44:34] pattern that it develops in cycles and
[44:38] in
[44:42] Seasons because if the plant life and
[44:46] things that relied upon the
[44:48] sunlight if it was an intense heat if it
[44:51] was the dead of Summer Phoenix 110 all
[44:54] day long from the day it Rose to the
[44:56] time it set nothing could have
[44:59] life it would be hot you ever planted
[45:02] something in the wrong season you ever
[45:04] tried to plant something in
[45:06] summer what happens it dries up and
[45:09] kills it why because it didn't get have
[45:12] time to put Roots
[45:14] down or if it was in the dead of winter
[45:16] somewhere and there was snow the sun
[45:19] still
[45:20] shines but yet it's not in in an
[45:23] atmosphere that a seed could grow under
[45:25] that sunlight but there is a time coming
[45:28] that in the winter it's going to turn
[45:30] over and that light and that seed that
[45:32] lays within the Earth is going to be
[45:34] able to bring forth of its own
[45:38] kind it's a
[45:42] progression so a progression of light a
[45:45] progression of life is dependent upon
[45:48] the progression of
[45:51] light a progression of life is dependent
[45:54] upon the progression of life just like
[45:57] your Christian
[45:58] walk you and I don't come to to Earth
[46:01] and you know these young boys they don't
[46:03] have all the revelations and know it all
[46:06] and if we were to have them come up and
[46:08] try to preach us a
[46:10] sermon they probably couldn't do it why
[46:12] because the Revelation isn't unfolding
[46:14] unto them I don't know it
[46:17] all but yet what it is is we're growing
[46:20] daily and we're maturing every single
[46:23] day and it's a
[46:25] process of sitting under the
[46:28] sunlight under the light of
[46:34] God and to re to re reject this
[46:39] sunlight to reject this
[46:42] sunlight would be
[46:44] death both naturally and
[46:47] spiritually brother Brandon would share
[46:49] a story about a man and he would say if
[46:51] there the Sun was shining outside and a
[46:54] man ran into a basement and he rejected
[46:56] the light said that there's no light
[46:58] there's no life out there the the
[47:00] sunlight isn't real he said you would
[47:02] consider him a crazy man and yet we s in
[47:05] a generation where the the the light of
[47:07] God has been shown and people have
[47:09] rejected the word of God they rejected
[47:12] the light for this
[47:14] hour it's the same thing but in a
[47:17] different
[47:23] form to reject the natural light is to
[47:27] reject death or to accept
[47:30] death you see his God sent his
[47:34] light His True Light to every
[47:37] age and over time as it moved
[47:41] down it began to get brighter and
[47:44] brighter and more Revelation and more
[47:47] Revelation as we see in the church
[47:49] ages God sent a light to every age and
[47:53] he would begin to unfold himself in a
[47:55] form and that was Truth for their
[47:58] day and you see that let's start at
[48:01] Luther and You Begin the Reformation of
[48:06] Luther and you would see that he would
[48:08] Minister a word and it would be a light
[48:10] for his
[48:11] day and it would begin to light up that
[48:15] age and it was truth but what happened
[48:20] they begin to
[48:21] denominate they begin to walk away they
[48:23] begin to walk away from this word of God
[48:27] they begin to get their own ideas and
[48:29] add to
[48:33] it truth for their hour it was it
[48:35] started out as the real
[48:40] light even through the Dark Ages and
[48:42] even the times of the you know the
[48:44] Christians being
[48:46] martyred and even when we went a few
[48:49] month or so ago whenever it was and they
[48:53] be you begin to walk the Coliseum and
[48:55] you can see where all the Christ
[48:56] Christians would have been
[48:59] martyred all the ones that gave their
[49:02] lives for the truth of their day and yet
[49:06] what would give them something to begin
[49:08] the more they killed the more would
[49:10] begin to come forward and give their
[49:12] lives what wasn't it wasn't themselves
[49:15] but it was their light they were
[49:16] catching the light for their day and
[49:18] they wanted that truth and they were
[49:20] coming
[49:22] forth but as the age goes on
[49:27] Darkness would
[49:29] happen and in each
[49:32] age God would raise up a man for that
[49:35] age they would have a truth until they
[49:40] denominated and you know the thing about
[49:42] artificial light
[49:43] here it's dependent upon a power
[49:48] source it's dependent upon a power
[49:52] source you can feel the anxiety the
[49:55] worry the fear is this supposed to
[49:56] happen but it's dependent upon the power
[49:59] source and as long as the power switches
[50:02] on we have light and there's no
[50:11] darkness and as long
[50:14] as that power source is turned on we
[50:19] have
[50:20] life and what would happen to every age
[50:23] as I said Luther would come and they be
[50:26] be he would begin to
[50:28] preach and share the light for that day
[50:31] and people would begin to catch it and
[50:33] light would come on and then they would
[50:36] denominate and God would pull himself
[50:38] from
[50:39] that and move away and darkness would
[50:41] happen upon the the
[50:44] Earth but what
[50:47] happened God raised up another
[50:50] man a light for that day he would begin
[50:53] to minister the word of God now I want
[50:56] want you to pretend that this is
[51:00] lamp and as a man would walk the Bible
[51:03] says the word is a lamp into our feet
[51:05] and a light into our path you understand
[51:08] that as you begin to walk the the light
[51:10] follows it begins to follow if I go over
[51:13] here or if I go over here see you guys
[51:15] can identify where the light is because
[51:17] this is the only light in the
[51:19] room and as I begin to walk listen it's
[51:22] my footsteps are in front of me and I
[51:24] can see where I'm going I can see that
[51:26] there's a step
[51:30] here but what happens is it's coming to
[51:34] me many people have a flashlight
[51:37] religion
[51:38] too they have it has a power source and
[51:41] if you turn off the power you're back in
[51:44] darkness so you come to church and you
[51:47] walk around and it's a lamp unto our
[51:48] feet and you can walk like this but then
[51:51] whenever you go out in the world and you
[51:53] go to school and you go to work and
[51:55] things begin to get dark AR around you
[51:57] and you want to fit in and you want to
[51:59] dress like the world and you want to
[52:00] wear a little makeup and you want to do
[52:02] a few things what do you do you turn off
[52:04] and you can fit in and you don't see
[52:08] it nothing's wrong but yet darkness is
[52:12] creeping into the home little things
[52:14] coming into our
[52:16] lives and yet God would raise up a
[52:20] man in that age and he would come with
[52:22] the
[52:23] word you see why why is it a lamp unto
[52:27] our feet because if we had a flashlight
[52:31] and we begin to shine out here we don't
[52:33] see what's in front of us we can't
[52:36] identify what's in front of us and when
[52:38] you can't identify what's in front of
[52:40] you that's when you begin to trip up
[52:41] that's when you begin to fall that's
[52:43] when you begin to make
[52:45] mistakes and you fall
[52:48] short and the and with the flashlight
[52:50] you begin to look around what is
[52:51] everybody else doing over there what is
[52:53] that church doing what is this doing
[52:57] all
[52:59] right oh we have it right here this is
[53:02] as far as we need it when you have a
[53:04] lamp the word of God to light your
[53:07] path and he sends the word and it lights
[53:10] up the the age once again go ahead
[53:15] Brothers he begins to light up the
[53:18] age you see the prophet of God said
[53:20] whenever you walk away from the true
[53:23] word of God for that day that's when the
[53:25] Holy Ghost that's when the Holy Spirit
[53:27] pulls himself from
[53:31] it artificial
[53:33] light dependent upon a power source
[53:36] dependent upon a sensation dependent
[53:38] upon a feeling when you become dependent
[53:41] upon something else maybe you're
[53:43] dependent upon a preacher some kind of
[53:45] preacher a song leader well they didn't
[53:46] sing me happy and you're dependent upon
[53:49] that to get worked up into an atmosphere
[53:52] listen when you have the word of God and
[53:54] it's the light for the day and you begin
[53:57] to walk in that light you're not
[53:59] dependent upon anything else you're not
[54:01] dependent upon a light source you're not
[54:03] dependent on is my is my person sitting
[54:06] next to me are they into church or you
[54:08] know do I got to come to church on a
[54:10] Wednesday Sing me happy and I don't feel
[54:13] like praising it don't matter if you
[54:15] don't feel like it that's the time to
[54:17] praise the Lord that's the time to say I
[54:21] believe in the word of
[54:24] God I believe this message of the
[54:27] hour it was sent for our
[54:32] day brother brandom says from that time
[54:35] on in 62 he says I've always said about
[54:38] organizations now we I know he's
[54:40] speaking in in a audience of of
[54:45] denominations listen to what he says he
[54:47] says I've always said about
[54:48] organizations I believe in them and I
[54:51] believe that they are fine they serve a
[54:53] purpose but you see when we make an
[54:56] organization 90% of us when we make and
[54:59] put down this is what I believe
[55:03] period this is what I believe period if
[55:06] you say this is what I believe comma and
[55:08] put as much as God is willing to add to
[55:11] us that's right that's all right then
[55:15] listen there's good people in
[55:16] denomination and I'm not going to take
[55:18] them out of Heaven because they don't
[55:20] believe what we believe yeah they might
[55:22] not be bride but we can't take them out
[55:24] of Heaven there's going to be good
[55:25] people up there there and Heaven is big
[55:28] enough for them
[55:34] too but this is what I believe period we
[55:37] got to be careful that we don't get that
[55:39] attitude in the message well this church
[55:41] says this and that church says this
[55:43] period this is what I
[55:45] believe no we're dependent upon the holy
[55:48] spirit that I say every time that I come
[55:50] to the house of God that you would
[55:52] Minister to my life that if Lord if I'm
[55:54] sitting here and maybe I'm cold and I'm
[55:56] starchy or maybe I haven't said amen in
[55:59] a while that you would move amongst us
[56:01] that you would speak to my heart and I
[56:03] could respond to that
[56:10] word you see when the pillar of fire
[56:12] moved Israel moved with it and in the
[56:15] New Testament when it began to move just
[56:17] exactly like it did in the Old Testament
[56:20] mve the same way Israel had to follow
[56:23] that Pillar of Fire and set the tent up
[56:26] under it and when it began to move in
[56:28] the last listen at the Reformation of
[56:30] Martin Luther saw it and then as soon as
[56:33] Luther was over they built an
[56:35] organization around Luther's work God
[56:37] moved right out from under it Wesley saw
[56:40] it and away he went and after Wesley
[56:42] Asbury and many others when after their
[56:45] time then that what happened they built
[56:48] an organization under it and God moved
[56:50] right out from under
[56:52] it and went right
[56:55] on you you see they tried to create a
[56:57] false
[56:58] light they tried to create a a false
[57:01] light brother Brandon would call it a
[57:02] painted fireplace you can't get warm
[57:05] from a painted fireplace listen if
[57:06] you're cold listen and it's dark a
[57:10] painted fireplace ain't going to do you
[57:11] no
[57:13] good ain't going to do you go
[57:19] good and brother Brandon begins to say
[57:22] and there's a man here that can turn on
[57:24] the light he says the greatest robber he
[57:26] begins to talk about the greatest
[57:27] robbery that ever took place was over in
[57:30] England it was like $7 million what was
[57:33] it because of a false light because of a
[57:36] false light what was it that train was
[57:37] headed down they set out some false
[57:39] light they stopped the train and they
[57:41] robbed them blind one of the greatest
[57:44] robberies brother brandom says and the
[57:47] greatest robbery the Church of God has
[57:49] ever had is a false light a glare their
[57:52] denomination he says it's robbed them
[57:54] from the power of the Holy Ghost
[57:56] it's took from the church the very
[57:59] Lifeline it's robbed them of the word of
[58:01] God when they've accepted a Creed
[58:03] instead of the word it's robbed them and
[58:06] they claim they have the word the word
[58:08] lives itself out of the of that for the
[58:12] age he says it makes itself known they
[58:14] claim they have the word too back there
[58:17] in the days of Jesus they said they saw
[58:19] a great light and they rejected it they
[58:21] saw it and they rejected
[58:24] it I say Lord let that not be us this
[58:27] tonight that we're not going to reject
[58:29] we're not going to turn around we're not
[58:30] going to pull away from this message
[58:33] there's many falling away and rejecting
[58:35] it falling faults with this and failures
[58:37] with this person but that if your
[58:40] Revelation isn't based upon that you
[58:42] won't fall if it's not based upon a man
[58:44] you won't
[58:45] fall that's why your Revelation has to
[58:47] be your own personal Walk With Jesus
[58:50] Christ
[58:56] and no matter how many false lights
[58:58] there is there is always a True Light to
[59:02] follow and that is the word of God the
[59:04] real genuine Holy Ghost as I said it's
[59:08] not dependent upon a camp meeting or or
[59:11] going to Camp or or some kind of
[59:14] anniversary meetings or some Gathering
[59:16] or a certain
[59:17] group no no no the Lord has placed you
[59:20] here in Phoenix Arizona to be a light in
[59:23] the city of
[59:24] Phoenix they you come every Wednesday
[59:27] and every Sunday and you you you fill up
[59:29] your lamps you know what happens too
[59:31] many times we go through out there in
[59:33] darkness and you know what happens when
[59:35] you're constantly using your lamps I
[59:38] only remember I'm old enough to remember
[59:39] the Coleman
[59:40] lamps but before the oil
[59:43] lamps what happens when you're
[59:45] constantly using the
[59:48] lamps you're burning oil like
[59:52] crazy you're burning it because you're
[59:55] always burning burning
[59:56] it what do you do on a Wednesday night
[59:59] you're coming and you're saying Lord
[1:00:01] fill me up Lord fill me up I got to make
[1:00:04] it to Sunday and I got to keep going I
[1:00:06] got to keep striving I got to keep
[1:00:08] living what is it that's what coming to
[1:00:11] church it'll charge you up it'll fill
[1:00:13] your tank
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:22] up the man who who was credited with
[1:00:26] creating the artificial light we would
[1:00:28] know him as Thomas Edison he created you
[1:00:31] know there was many that had to you know
[1:00:32] a lot to do with it and putting it
[1:00:34] together but he was the one that created
[1:00:36] you know uh he was one that created the
[1:00:39] one that it lasted like 1,200 hours or
[1:00:41] something like that so he was credited
[1:00:44] with the light
[1:00:45] bulb creating the light
[1:00:47] bulb and you know the thing about it is
[1:00:50] this man he would say he' fail I failed
[1:00:52] 10,000 times he said I didn't fail
[1:00:55] 10,000 times it just to it was there it
[1:00:58] was 10,000 times or ways that the light
[1:01:01] bulb didn't
[1:01:02] work he says I never failed and I think
[1:01:05] the beautiful thing about it is is God
[1:01:07] in one day came down to earth and said
[1:01:09] let there be light and it was light no
[1:01:12] failures no
[1:01:14] Faults he just spoke
[1:01:16] it that's a God I can depend upon but
[1:01:19] what happens is US humans we try to
[1:01:22] invent something we try to come up with
[1:01:23] something and we have faults and we have
[1:01:24] failures but you you know what as long
[1:01:26] as you if you keep falling and you keep
[1:01:28] failing that's okay get back up again
[1:01:31] keep
[1:01:34] going because if you're not failing
[1:01:37] you're not
[1:01:40] falling you're not doing
[1:01:42] anything you're not brother Brandon
[1:01:45] would tell a story about a a Salesman
[1:01:49] the car salesman and that boy would come
[1:01:50] in for a job I believe it was and he
[1:01:52] would
[1:01:53] come as a Salesman and and he would come
[1:01:56] to get a job and the boy didn't have a
[1:01:58] pencil on his or eraser on his
[1:02:01] pencil and the man said where's your
[1:02:03] eraser at says I don't need one I don't
[1:02:05] make
[1:02:07] mistakes I don't make mistakes you ever
[1:02:10] heard those type of Christians I don't
[1:02:12] make
[1:02:15] mistakes guess what he said I can't use
[1:02:18] you I can't use you why because you're
[1:02:21] not afraid to fail you're not afraid to
[1:02:23] step out listen when the spirit of God
[1:02:25] sometimes moves upon you and he might
[1:02:27] have you to sing a song special and you
[1:02:29] never sung before you might give a
[1:02:31] testimony you might do something for
[1:02:32] somebody what is God he wants you to
[1:02:34] step out of your boat get out of your
[1:02:36] comfort zone don't be afraid to
[1:02:39] fail do something for
[1:02:42] God be a
[1:02:48] light you know when you begin to fail
[1:02:50] when you begin to do something for God
[1:02:52] you know what happens you begin to have
[1:02:55] critics
[1:02:58] critics you know that you begin to have
[1:03:02] critics well that brother man man he
[1:03:04] could preach this but yeah I wish he
[1:03:06] could preach like this or he needs to
[1:03:08] preach like that and I didn't ask you I
[1:03:10] didn't want this
[1:03:12] anyway well do it yourself you know what
[1:03:16] happens a lot of people want DIY do it
[1:03:21] yourself that's what we try to do with
[1:03:23] our Christian walk I'm going to DIY this
[1:03:26] I'm going to get through my own trial
[1:03:27] I'm going to do it myself I don't need
[1:03:32] nobody listen don't be afraid to
[1:03:36] fail but when you fail and you're on
[1:03:39] your knees get back up keep pressing
[1:03:44] on let's hit them
[1:03:48] critics because it's ones that bring
[1:03:51] discouragement when you try to do
[1:03:53] something for God what happens you begin
[1:03:55] to hear voices and people talk and oh
[1:03:58] why why is he up there and why this and
[1:04:00] why that and all the you know what then
[1:04:02] what happens you become discouraged you
[1:04:04] become
[1:04:06] distraught but yet brother Brandon would
[1:04:08] talk about every picture that went
[1:04:10] through the Hall of Fame had to go
[1:04:11] through the Hall of
[1:04:14] critics had to go through a hall of
[1:04:20] critics and you know the critics most of
[1:04:22] the time the ones that are
[1:04:24] criticizing are not even doing
[1:04:27] anything but
[1:04:32] criticizing that's right brother Ron
[1:04:34] said armchair quarterback oh if I was in
[1:04:37] the game this is how I would do it oh he
[1:04:39] missed the pass over here oh he did this
[1:04:41] why didn't he do that oh he should have
[1:04:43] you know called an audible he should
[1:04:45] have done this what is it armchair
[1:04:47] quarterback then he get in the game and
[1:04:49] then he fumbles the ball
[1:04:57] it's
[1:04:58] life CR criticism is going to
[1:05:03] come but that's okay you know when
[1:05:06] criticism happens brother brandom says
[1:05:09] you know what that is when little things
[1:05:11] come up and and maybe you know people
[1:05:13] are saying this or that or a little bit
[1:05:15] of criticism you know what that is
[1:05:17] Growing Pains of God's
[1:05:19] [Music]
[1:05:21] grace Growing Pains of God's grace
[1:05:28] brother brandham says in Shalom what is
[1:05:31] light the Vindicated word spoken word of
[1:05:35] God outside of that there is no light
[1:05:38] see you can't lighten the Earth with
[1:05:41] flashlights it takes God's
[1:05:45] word that's made manifest the
[1:05:50] Sun not the Su in but the s o in the Son
[1:05:53] of God for your day and in your
[1:05:56] hour you see when
[1:05:59] it's a real Holy
[1:06:03] Ghost when your foundation is upon the
[1:06:05] word of
[1:06:07] God no matter what comes you can always
[1:06:11] go back to this no matter the darkness
[1:06:14] outside no matter how cold no matter the
[1:06:17] way you feel it's not based upon your
[1:06:21] feelings but when you have the Holy
[1:06:23] Ghost and it's burning inside of you
[1:06:25] there's no way to put it out it goes
[1:06:27] with you when you go when you go to the
[1:06:29] store and when you go on vacation and
[1:06:31] when you go anywhere what is it it's the
[1:06:34] same light it's the Holy Ghost you can't
[1:06:36] put it out you can't turn it off it's
[1:06:39] the very life of the
[1:06:43] believer and the darker the darkness the
[1:06:46] greater the
[1:06:49] light the darker the darkness the
[1:06:52] greater the light will burn
[1:06:56] you see and many times God will move in
[1:06:58] a certain way an unexpected
[1:07:02] way let's take Paul and
[1:07:05] Silas let's take Paul and Silas brother
[1:07:08] and in the Bible it says and I have it
[1:07:11] here that acts whenever they begin to
[1:07:14] and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed
[1:07:16] and sang songs unto God because of the
[1:07:19] condition that we're in listen they were
[1:07:21] in a prison cell and they were down in
[1:07:23] darkness and they were covered and they
[1:07:25] were in bondage and I'm sure rats and
[1:07:27] and crumbs were laying around them but
[1:07:29] whenever you're all completely engulfed
[1:07:31] in darkness what else is there to do
[1:07:35] what else can you do let's bring it to
[1:07:38] today in your condition maybe you're all
[1:07:40] wrapped up in darkness and you have this
[1:07:43] problem and that problem and you don't
[1:07:44] know what tomorrow holds but let me say
[1:07:46] this I Know Who Holds Tomorrow and that
[1:07:49] Darkness can be pushed out from the
[1:07:53] light but they sat in dark Darkness they
[1:07:56] didn't sit there and have a pity party
[1:07:58] they didn't sit there and question God
[1:08:00] and
[1:08:01] why and the Bible says at midnight why
[1:08:05] midnight it's more than a
[1:08:08] Time listen when M why midnight because
[1:08:12] it's the darkest of all
[1:08:16] hours it's trying to tell you something
[1:08:18] when it's the darkest of your hour and
[1:08:20] you don't know what tomorrow and you
[1:08:21] can't see too far what do you do
[1:08:29] let me say
[1:08:31] this yeah reading your Bible is good and
[1:08:35] you should do it but you can't do that
[1:08:37] in
[1:08:40] darkness yeah you can listen to a
[1:08:42] message tape but if you're sitting in
[1:08:44] their Darkness there's no access to
[1:08:48] that but what can you do you can begin
[1:08:51] to get on your
[1:08:53] knees and you can begin to pray on to
[1:08:55] God and say God I don't know what
[1:08:58] tomorrow holds I don't know the future
[1:09:00] but I trust you and I know that my my
[1:09:03] life is in your hands and you begin to
[1:09:05] worship and you begin to say praise God
[1:09:08] and in those prison chains listen they
[1:09:10] begin to worship and they begin to
[1:09:12] praise and what happened the doors begin
[1:09:15] to open not only did it set them free
[1:09:18] but it set those around them free and
[1:09:21] that's what happens when you come to
[1:09:22] church whenever you raise your hands and
[1:09:24] praise God and you've been praying in
[1:09:26] your prayer closet and you've been
[1:09:28] worshiping God what is he doing he's
[1:09:31] bringing a liberty he's bringing a
[1:09:35] freedom and you're going to set those
[1:09:37] around you
[1:09:40] free What Makes You
[1:09:43] Different I'm able to set that neighbor
[1:09:46] maybe you come to church maybe it's been
[1:09:49] a while since you've knelt down on your
[1:09:51] knees and talked to God hey I understand
[1:09:54] we're all humans we get busy with life
[1:09:57] life
[1:09:59] happens and if you don't dedicate time
[1:10:02] to
[1:10:03] God to pray and read time will pass you
[1:10:07] by but maybe it's been a while since
[1:10:10] you've knelt down and prayed and gave a
[1:10:12] little worship to God God inhabits the
[1:10:15] Praises of his
[1:10:17] people but yet you come to church and
[1:10:20] you sit next to somebody that has been
[1:10:22] they might set you free
[1:10:26] the effect that you might have on
[1:10:28] somebody else's life they don't even
[1:10:31] know
[1:10:33] it the darkest of all
[1:10:38] hours brother brandham says in we have
[1:10:41] seen the star and have come to worship
[1:10:43] him he says I think that light shines
[1:10:47] the best in
[1:10:48] darkness darker it is the better the
[1:10:51] light
[1:10:51] shines sometimes just a small little
[1:10:54] light where there's much light it's not
[1:10:57] noticed but the darker it
[1:11:00] gets that that small light will shine
[1:11:03] that much stronger and remember that
[1:11:07] there's no Darkness can exist in the
[1:11:09] presence of the light the light is so
[1:11:12] much more powerful than Darkness until
[1:11:14] it can't stand in the presence listen no
[1:11:18] matter how great your light is you might
[1:11:20] think that you have a
[1:11:22] little a little lighter
[1:11:25] and you might come to church and there
[1:11:27] might be some that you look up to and
[1:11:30] you see Grandpa he's over here and he
[1:11:32] has a bomb fire going and you have this
[1:11:35] brother over here and he's been basking
[1:11:36] in the word and they have a big old fire
[1:11:38] and you feel ashamed with your little
[1:11:42] light but yet a little light is better
[1:11:45] than no
[1:11:46] light and let me tell you something that
[1:11:49] little light whenever you go out into
[1:11:51] the world and you begin to get around
[1:11:52] your co-workers and you begin to go to
[1:11:54] school and you begin to walk around you
[1:11:56] don't even have to go to a certain place
[1:11:58] but people identify walking through an
[1:12:00] airport whatever may be amen they can
[1:12:03] identify that there's light and that
[1:12:06] light brings
[1:12:10] life and it presses out the
[1:12:14] darkness it pushes
[1:12:17] back the
[1:12:19] darkness now I want to take it
[1:12:21] back as we opened with Genesis
[1:12:26] and in Genesis 1 because we are Earth
[1:12:28] and
[1:12:30] vessels and we see that in the beginning
[1:12:33] that God
[1:12:34] created and it was without form and it
[1:12:37] was without void what is without form
[1:12:40] and I looked up form and it's a it's the
[1:12:42] visible shape or configuration of
[1:12:45] something it's a particular way in which
[1:12:47] a thing exists appears it's a
[1:12:49] manifestation but if it sits in
[1:12:52] darkness how do you know what it's
[1:12:54] supposed to manifest
[1:12:56] how do you know what it's supposed to be
[1:12:59] how do you know what the potential is
[1:13:01] supposed to
[1:13:04] be and void it contains nothing empty
[1:13:09] vacant not not occupied not filled it is
[1:13:13] just out
[1:13:14] there and so here you were this type of
[1:13:18] world that was going through life
[1:13:20] without form without purpose without
[1:13:22] reason you were all voided up there was
[1:13:25] nothing there you were vacant you were
[1:13:27] not filled with
[1:13:30] anything but then one
[1:13:34] day you know I was when I was listening
[1:13:37] to the tape brother Brandon began to
[1:13:40] talk about the Earth and before it
[1:13:44] began how long did it sit in
[1:13:47] vacancy how long did it sit there
[1:13:50] without form and
[1:13:52] darkness it could have been billions
[1:13:54] tril Millions how many years was it that
[1:13:58] it sat there without nothing on it
[1:14:02] nothing
[1:14:04] happening but yet it was kind of for a
[1:14:08] purpose because how long was it before
[1:14:11] you and the spirit of God began to blow
[1:14:14] across the Waters of your life maybe you
[1:14:18] were 12 years old may you were raised in
[1:14:20] this message but maybe you've gone 4050
[1:14:23] I don't know how many years without the
[1:14:25] spirit of God and then one day the
[1:14:27] spirit of God begin to blow upon the
[1:14:30] waters he began to move and when God
[1:14:33] begins to move he brings life into it he
[1:14:36] brings life into that
[1:14:40] atmosphere and God began to move upon
[1:14:42] the waters what does Waters
[1:14:45] represent
[1:14:46] people so you're telling me the same
[1:14:49] thing that God did then and moving
[1:14:51] across the waters he's doing again
[1:14:53] tonight that he begins his holy spirit
[1:14:56] is going and it's blowing across the
[1:14:58] people and it's bringing it to
[1:15:01] light and it's bringing life to
[1:15:05] it as I said there's no way to know the
[1:15:09] potential until it is brought into the
[1:15:12] light because when Jesus said let there
[1:15:15] be light and there was
[1:15:17] light what is it it's a great revealing
[1:15:20] if you want to reveal something you
[1:15:22] bring it to the light
[1:15:25] if you want to reveal something you
[1:15:26] bring it into the
[1:15:30] light there's a lot of things done in
[1:15:33] darkness the world lives in darkness
[1:15:37] naturally the life of the world starts
[1:15:40] whenever it gets
[1:15:41] dark that's why to the believer there's
[1:15:43] nothing out there during the night
[1:15:46] time it's just death
[1:15:57] and
[1:15:57] the and the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:16:00] face of the
[1:16:04] waters moved upon in an unexpected
[1:16:08] way you see when the spirit of God
[1:16:11] begins to move upon your
[1:16:13] life that water had never felt the
[1:16:17] charge of the spirit of God it never
[1:16:20] felt the Embrace of God when he said let
[1:16:24] there be light it had never
[1:16:27] received just as we would see the sun
[1:16:30] rise it never felt the warmth of the ray
[1:16:33] of
[1:16:35] sunshine but yet when God begin to speak
[1:16:39] and he begin to say let there be
[1:16:43] light and he divided the light from the
[1:16:51] darkness and God saw that the light was
[1:16:53] good and God
[1:16:55] divided the light from Darkness you see
[1:16:58] God didn't take away the
[1:17:01] darkness God didn't take away the
[1:17:05] darkness but he left it there for a
[1:17:10] purpose he left it there for a
[1:17:12] purpose but he divided the light from
[1:17:15] the
[1:17:16] darkness and in
[1:17:19] darkness then he would place the Bible
[1:17:23] says he has two lights one great to rule
[1:17:25] the day and the other one to rule the
[1:17:29] night and in that night so now that he
[1:17:31] divided the
[1:17:33] darkness we see that in darkness there
[1:17:36] is still light to rule over that
[1:17:39] Darkness what is the purpose of the
[1:17:42] Moon to give light until the sun
[1:17:52] returns you see tonight he's still
[1:17:55] separating the light from Darkness from
[1:17:57] our
[1:17:58] lives he's still moving Upon Our Earth
[1:18:01] and
[1:18:02] vessels he's taking away things that
[1:18:04] aren't Christlike things in our lives
[1:18:07] that try to creep in and the Bible says
[1:18:09] gross Darkness would come upon the
[1:18:11] people and it would begin to creep in it
[1:18:14] might become in as little secret things
[1:18:16] we'll
[1:18:18] read maybe we watch maybe we see maybe
[1:18:22] we allow our kids to do dark dark nness
[1:18:25] creeping
[1:18:28] in maybe creeping into our
[1:18:31] homes to the kids
[1:18:35] rooms we don't even realize it and you
[1:18:39] say well I got my life yeah but the
[1:18:41] darkness is
[1:18:45] overcoming the Bible says Jesus told
[1:18:48] Peter the devil would sift you as we
[1:18:51] he's after you like a roaring lion
[1:18:54] seeking whom he may
[1:19:01] devour darkness of complexes or
[1:19:04] sickness darkness of sin what is sin
[1:19:07] it's unbelief unbelief in his word
[1:19:11] because when you walk away from the
[1:19:13] light of
[1:19:15] God you're walking into
[1:19:20] darkness but you see whenever you have
[1:19:23] that Holy Ghost it pushes PES back the
[1:19:26] darkness it pushes back it becomes a
[1:19:29] barrier and as Darkness tries to come in
[1:19:32] it tries to come after your kids or it
[1:19:34] tries to take this and cause arguments
[1:19:37] between you and your wife or or or or
[1:19:39] disagreements or whatever it may
[1:19:42] be what is it it is a light that holds
[1:19:46] us it is an
[1:19:49] anchor it is our TI
[1:19:52] poost Ephesians 5 and8
[1:19:56] says for we for ye were in some Darkness
[1:19:59] sometime
[1:20:00] Darkness but now ye are in Light walk as
[1:20:04] children in the light for the fruit of
[1:20:06] the spirit is in all goodness and
[1:20:09] righteousness and Truth proving what is
[1:20:12] acceptable acceptable unto the Lord and
[1:20:14] have no fellowship with unfruitful works
[1:20:17] of darkness but rather reprove them for
[1:20:20] it is a shame to even speak of those
[1:20:23] things
[1:20:25] which are
[1:20:26] done of them in
[1:20:29] secret that's a powerful
[1:20:32] scripture those things done in
[1:20:36] secret I say Lord help
[1:20:40] us to bring things into
[1:20:43] light and not allow these things to
[1:20:45] creep into our
[1:20:48] homes secret sins let me tell you
[1:20:52] something secret sins will become
[1:20:53] manifest if you are a son or a daughter
[1:20:55] of God secret sins will be manifest to
[1:21:00] light and you don't want God to do
[1:21:04] that you want to come and bring those
[1:21:06] things into manifestation and say God I
[1:21:09] have failed I have fallen down Lord I'm
[1:21:11] sorry I've made a mistake I'm going to
[1:21:13] do better Lord put these into the sea of
[1:21:16] your forgetfulness Lord help me to do
[1:21:19] better help me to keep these things in
[1:21:22] light because if God does it and he
[1:21:25] brings it to
[1:21:32] manifestation but all things that are
[1:21:34] reproved are made manifest by light for
[1:21:38] whatsoever doeth make manifest his light
[1:21:42] and wherefore he saith awake thou
[1:21:45] sleepest and arise from the dead and
[1:21:46] Christ shall give thee light I say it's
[1:21:50] time to wake
[1:21:52] up naturally and spiritually yes
[1:21:57] sir it's time to wake up and to identify
[1:22:00] and to recognize the light of your day
[1:22:02] the word for this hour to walk in the
[1:22:05] light as he is in the light and as the
[1:22:07] light keeps moving on as we keep
[1:22:09] progressing and moving forward we have
[1:22:11] an end
[1:22:13] goal we must move as the holy spirit
[1:22:15] moves and he guides
[1:22:21] us I'm going to close
[1:22:27] 1 John 1 and5 he says this then is the
[1:22:30] message that we have heard of him and
[1:22:32] declared unto you that God is light and
[1:22:35] in him is no Darkness at all if we say
[1:22:38] that we have fellowship with him and
[1:22:40] walk in darkness we lie and do not the
[1:22:43] truth but if we walk in the light as he
[1:22:46] is in the light we have Fellowship one
[1:22:48] with another you want to have fellowship
[1:22:50] with God Walk In The Light amen if you
[1:22:54] want to have fellowship with him if
[1:22:56] you're wondering why things are going
[1:22:58] wrong or why there's just a disconnect
[1:23:01] listen if you stop talking to your
[1:23:04] wife and you just stop talking and stop
[1:23:07] having Fellowship you're going to have
[1:23:09] problems you're going to have
[1:23:11] problems because they want to express
[1:23:15] themselves to you they want to talk to
[1:23:16] you they want Fellowship there's a
[1:23:19] reason you married her is to have
[1:23:21] Fellowship to live this life together to
[1:23:23] enjoy
[1:23:26] life but if you cut that
[1:23:28] off what good is
[1:23:31] it so if you want fellowship with God
[1:23:33] talk to
[1:23:34] him talk to him walk with him and when
[1:23:39] you begin to walk with him and talk with
[1:23:40] him let me tell you he's going to walk
[1:23:42] and talk with you back you will have
[1:23:45] fellowship with
[1:23:51] him but if you walk in the light as he
[1:23:53] is in the light we have Fellowship one
[1:23:55] with another and the blood of Jesus
[1:23:57] Christ his son cleanses us from all
[1:24:01] sin musicians come another scripture
[1:24:05] John 3 And1 19 and as I read
[1:24:09] this because many people read John 3:16
[1:24:12] for God so love the world that he gave
[1:24:14] his only begotten son we know
[1:24:19] that but yet
[1:24:22] in in John 3
[1:24:25] 19 and even between John 3:16 and 19 he
[1:24:29] says that my son was not to sent to
[1:24:33] condemn the world but through him might
[1:24:35] be
[1:24:35] saved but now listen to verse 19 but
[1:24:39] this is the condemnation that light is
[1:24:41] come into the world and Men love
[1:24:43] Darkness rather than light because their
[1:24:46] deeds were evil for everyone that doeth
[1:24:49] evil hateth light neither cometh to the
[1:24:51] light lest his deeds should be reproved
[1:24:54] mov D and he that doeth truth cometh to
[1:24:58] the
[1:24:59] light and that his deeds may be made
[1:25:01] manifest that they are rotten
[1:25:08] gone many people stop at John
[1:25:12] 3:16 that I believe that God
[1:25:15] sent this one down and he died for my
[1:25:18] sins and I can live as I want to but you
[1:25:21] got to keep going
[1:25:22] on this is the condemnation that they
[1:25:25] Lov Darkness more than
[1:25:28] light they rejected the light for their
[1:25:32] [Music]
[1:25:39] day then Jesus spake unto them saying I
[1:25:43] am the light of the
[1:25:44] world he that followeth me shall not
[1:25:48] walk in
[1:25:49] darkness but shall
[1:25:52] have the light of
[1:25:56] life I'm so thankful that we had a
[1:25:58] messenger sent to this
[1:26:00] day that would begin to walk us through
[1:26:03] the scriptures and he would begin to
[1:26:05] unfold the very word that was sent for
[1:26:08] our day and for our
[1:26:10] hour and if you want a sermon to go
[1:26:12] listen
[1:26:13] to go listen to
[1:26:16] Shalom go listen to Shalom good morning
[1:26:20] peace be unto you why to the bride it's
[1:26:23] a new day it's a new light it's the
[1:26:26] revealing of the word you don't have to
[1:26:29] walk in
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:33] darkness
[1:26:36] Shalom peace
[1:26:39] bride listen this isn't our end
[1:26:45] [Music]
[1:26:47] goal he says the hour is upon us
[1:26:50] Darkness grows Darkness Darkness upon
[1:26:53] the people now
[1:26:54] that's what it is what does it all mean
[1:26:57] where are we standing what hour are we
[1:26:59] in how close are we to the
[1:27:01] coming 1964 he's saying
[1:27:05] this how close are we
[1:27:08] Church what doesn't mean God has begin
[1:27:11] to separate the light from Darkness see
[1:27:14] pressing
[1:27:15] it behind like he did in the beginning
[1:27:18] to show the dawn of a new day the church
[1:27:22] ages are fading out the church ages are
[1:27:24] fading out he says God is pressing the
[1:27:27] darkness into a place it has to do it to
[1:27:30] fade out the church organizations to
[1:27:33] fade out the world the world is covering
[1:27:35] the thing over worldly ISM has took the
[1:27:39] whole
[1:27:40] thing that isn't God right by worldly
[1:27:44] things and worldly dress and worldly
[1:27:46] acting and worldly living it's the
[1:27:50] world ye are not of the world Little
[1:27:53] Children You are of of Heaven this is
[1:27:56] not your
[1:27:58] [Music]
[1:28:00] home he says gross Darkness listen if
[1:28:03] you want to identify where we are this
[1:28:06] is it he says gross Darkness the
[1:28:08] blinding of Israel was the lightning for
[1:28:11] the Gentiles now the blinding of the
[1:28:13] Gentiles is lightning of the Israel it's
[1:28:17] just like the day and night one side has
[1:28:19] got darkness and the other has got light
[1:28:23] and then the light over over come comes
[1:28:25] over on the other side so the moon
[1:28:27] passing the way it did and the
[1:28:28] reflection of Darkness of the world
[1:28:31] blinding out it's light it's a
[1:28:34] reflection to us that the Gentile age is
[1:28:37] just
[1:28:39] finished the church is making herself
[1:28:41] ready been making herself ready for a
[1:28:43] long time it's time for
[1:28:46] Rapture for darkness is fading upon the
[1:28:50] Gentiles and the dawn will soon break
[1:28:53] upon the Jews
[1:28:55] the sun has traveled from the East to
[1:28:57] the west and we're on the west coast he
[1:29:01] says the light can only do one thing go
[1:29:03] back east on the other side you
[1:29:06] understand you know the light can only
[1:29:08] go back East again to where to where it
[1:29:10] began at Israel God blinding them for a
[1:29:14] while but the darkness now is pressing
[1:29:17] upon the Gentile world that's covered
[1:29:19] the whole thing the Gentiles will trod
[1:29:22] down Jerusalem until the Gentile
[1:29:24] dispensation will be
[1:29:26] finished Jesus said so and now it's the
[1:29:29] finishing gross Darkness upon the people
[1:29:32] God reflecting it in the
[1:29:35] skies as he has shown it on the earth
[1:29:37] before it it happen we're in
[1:29:40] it we're here it's happening what is
[1:29:44] happening in Israel right now Wars free
[1:29:47] Palestine they don't even know
[1:29:49] why but there's a purpose it's got to
[1:29:52] come to manifestation
[1:29:54] what is it that part of the scripture
[1:29:57] that part of Prophecy what is it it's
[1:29:59] coming to
[1:30:00] light it's coming into Revelation is
[1:30:03] being made known before us don't miss it
[1:30:09] Bri the closing of the Gentile days is
[1:30:12] almost
[1:30:14] [Music]
[1:30:18] over it's almost time to go home
[1:30:22] [Music]
[1:30:30] you know as I begin to think
[1:30:33] about just even this quote
[1:30:36] [Music]
[1:30:38] here what was it this year we seen the
[1:30:43] eclipse the eclipse happening what was
[1:30:47] it the sun shining in the day and the
[1:30:51] moon covering it over
[1:30:55] let me ask you what happened to the
[1:30:58] Earth
[1:31:01] Darkness but on the other side it was
[1:31:06] [Music]
[1:31:11] light uniting time is
[1:31:14] happening the flashing red lights of the
[1:31:17] end time are
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:22] here oh read these and be done
[1:31:27] because we got so much more to live
[1:31:30] for in Revelations 21 it says and the
[1:31:33] city had no need of the sun neither of
[1:31:36] the moon to shine in it for the glory of
[1:31:40] God did lighten it and the lamb is the
[1:31:43] light
[1:31:45] thereof Revelations 22 and there shall
[1:31:48] be no night
[1:31:51] there and they need no candle
[1:31:54] no light from the sun for the Lord
[1:31:58] God giveth them light and they shall
[1:32:04] reign they shall reain
[1:32:07] forever and
[1:32:12] ever you're going to rain ah this
[1:32:15] temporary Darkness though it
[1:32:17] presses though it tries to engulf us try
[1:32:20] though it tries to come in and
[1:32:22] pressurize
[1:32:24] listen there's a light that shines
[1:32:28] greater let us
[1:32:34] stand he says we have seen the star he
[1:32:37] says in this dark world someday is going
[1:32:40] to turn
[1:32:41] all light when Jesus Christ the son of
[1:32:45] righteousness shall come again then we
[1:32:48] shall have no more Darkness until that
[1:32:51] time just as we look out
[1:32:54] at night time and see the moon and he
[1:32:57] begins to talk about correlating that
[1:33:00] the Moon is just a reflection of the
[1:33:03] sunlight you are here to reflect
[1:33:06] him it's no light of your own no glory
[1:33:09] within
[1:33:11] ourselves but you are here to reflect
[1:33:16] him let's bow our heads
[1:33:26] father we humble ourselves in your
[1:33:29] presence Lord we're so thankful for the
[1:33:32] light we're so thankful for this light
[1:33:34] of the hour we're so thankful for the
[1:33:36] message of this hour we're so thankful
[1:33:38] that you sent our Prophet who didn't
[1:33:40] deviate and and tried to compromise with
[1:33:43] this message but he stayed with the
[1:33:46] light of the word of God and many would
[1:33:49] fall to the left and some would fall to
[1:33:51] the right and they would try to make it
[1:33:53] denom ation and we even see it happening
[1:33:56] within the message of you know press
[1:33:57] play and the different things that are
[1:33:59] that are going on we're not worried
[1:34:02] about those things we're staying focused
[1:34:04] on the very true light that you've given
[1:34:06] for this
