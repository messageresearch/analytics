[Music] worship name amen give him praise this [Music] evening amen amen God bless you all this evening amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord we're having uh communion and foot washing tonight you know prophet of God said that Jesus left us three ordinances not three suggestions three ordinances you do this until I come is that right amen so it's extremely important this isn't something that we just well let's just throw it in there and and everything say no we we do it and I've always said that even on communion and foot washing it's always uh good to uh see as many as you can out to the house of God because it's a checks and balances it's a service where you have some retrospect you look at your own lives and and everything and uh so that's what we're doing this evening now uh wanted to make an announcement Wednesday um the 15th of this month Wednesday evening Andrew Glover will be here brother Andrew Glover uh we're having a tape service Sunday evening Sunday evening on um November 19th that's uh for those that want to make it I believe that uh it's very important that we get together we listen to it t because I'm convinced you're not listening enough amen amen I only heard this one or two David say Amen again amen amen somebody else say amen that's right that's right because there is one voice ordained of God in this day to turn your hearts back and Faith cometh by hearing hearing hearing the word word of God Amen you want more faith increase your hearing that's right amen all right so um now some are asking is this going to be the third Sunday of every month if we can schedule it yes if not we'll we'll announce it we may have to play with that uh you know depending on some of uh our trips and things I've been staying quite a bit home uh as you know and but here in November we're going to start doing some missionary work taking about uh five or six brothers with us to the country country of vatu and going to be there and having some uh Jubilee meetings with them and then we will be going January 2nd over to South Africa and be having a couple Services over there and brother dibl uh is getting married so we're going over there and we'll perform help uh perform the wedding over there in South Africa and uh just Rejoice with them uh so we'll look forward to that and uh I am not going to keep you too long tonight uh because it is communion and foot washing but uh I was prepared uh I had Plan B just in case his plane was a little bit late you know I'm always nervous and uh so uh I was so pleased how many of you really enjoyed the service this morning amen amen thank you Lord Brother Paul that was mature and wise that was good for every church and every Minister I think ministers should down and should sit down and listen to that because some of the worst examples of even brotherly kindness are the ministry because if you don't agree with him yeah out of here you know and and you know Hey listen we should have the closer that we get to God the less arrogant spirit amen the less selfish Spirit the less prideful you know the thing that impressed everybody about brother brandham was his humility right huh God help us to be humble and not proud and arrogant and stuffed shirts or anything like that but God just give us a greater portion of the Holy Ghost and that will cause us devour our heads in humility amen amen um I certainly appreciate even how you approached it started with uh a little bit of your background and your personal testimony showing you can be raised in the message you can have the head knowledge of it you can even agree that it's the word of God but until you catch your own personal revelation what it is is you're just kind of swept right along now that's okay heading on is okay but it'll only take you so far amen see that's why you need the new birth that's why the mystery of even what he was saying you see before they could fulfill the Commandment to go and multiply they fell so they were cast out of even Eden so they had to go forth and multiply in a uh Fallen state so Jesus then coming okay the great Boaz the great kinsman redeemer he comes and what he does what was his first doctrine that he taught you must be born again okay so then the new birth so he says so look it's not your natural birth okay he said it's to be born again that's why he told Nicodemus uh you know listen Nicodemus don't Marvel at this that a man must be born again but except a man be born again of the spirit he'll not see the kingdom of God he'll not understand his mind is carnal amen amen so um praise the Lord so I just certainly enjoyed that and if we have Unity of the spirit first and what Spirit not our spirit not a church Spirit not a pastor's Spirit not one another Spirit but his Spirit when we have Unity of that Spirit it will eventually eventually come to the unity of the faith and I I tell you I I don't think I've ever heard that quote where brother abam said Hey listen when we get over there and we see him face to a face then you and I will see I die amen hallelujah hey that's that's profound that's right so one says he's coming on a white horse and others coming on a white cloud and they disagree and have issues and separate brother BR says what does it matter as long as we agree he's coming amen amen amen so God give us the right kind of Spirit a spirit that's teachable amen because brother Bram said I'd rather have the right Spirit and the wrong Doctrine than I would to have the right Doctrine wrong Spirit God help us St John chapter 1 St John chapter 1 don't mean to keep you all standing too long thank you musicians God bless you guys certainly appreciate them appreciate the song special of the mon Menards and the family the children amen it's a family affair amen amen Amen brother Brown said that you're part of the family of God he took your picture before the foundation of the world he put it in his photo album Glory Hallelujah it's a family affair why he's your father St John chapter 1: 45 through 51 St John 1 verse 45 and Philip findeth Nathaniel saith unto him we have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did right Jesus of Nazareth son of Joseph Nathaniel said unto him can there any good thing come out of Nazareth and Philip argued with him bent his arm no you know look be salty he said hey he said unto him come and see amen this is what we think it is you come and make up your mind and Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and saith of him behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no G I want to ask you which pull is that second pull discernment so now see he's he's already in the discernment phase of his ministry behold the Israelite in fact if you just go up a few verses before he he's talking to Peter Thou Art sephus okay and so you you begin to see the ministry of Christ and it gives us a pattern brother Bram said every great ministry within the word has three PS he said Moses had three PS Elijah had three PS okay and so this ministry in the end time typing that of Christ and of the prophets is going to have three plls also so he's in a second pull Nathaniel said unto him whence knowest thou me Jesus answered and said unto him before that Philip called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I thought saw thee that's amazing he's seeing him under a fig tree I wonder what he was doing I'm sure that God was even aware of his thoughts amen and Nathaniel answered and said un him Rabbi Thou Art the Son of God Thou Art the king of Israel and Jesus entered and said unto him because I said unto thee I saw thee under the Fig Tree believest thou wow you you mean to tell me wow you're calling me the king of uh Israel You're a rabbi all of this wow you only saw the second pull because I told you this watch Thou shalt see greater things than these amen he's speaking of greater things and he saith unto him verily verily I say unto you Hereafter you shall see the heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon on the son of man may God add the blessing to the word you can all be seated this evening in the presence of God somebody say amen amen glory turn with me if you would to St John 16 read two more scriptures here before we go on so we'll go to St John chapter 16 St John 16 verse 12- 16 now I want you to notice the words of Christ and and let's take notice of it I like to dissect things therefore hey I'm going to use that from now on because that was so good huh Warren did you like that yeah therefore yeah Hallelujah John 16 verse2 I have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now somebody say now now time is coming but you can't get it now how be it when he now notice he's going to he's going to let them know how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and you shall see me because I go to the father amen I want you to take notice of verse 12 I have yet many things wow I want to share unto you the whole counsil of God but you can't understand it now why because there are degrees of our maturity and of our understanding the Apostle Paul said when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child huh I acted like a child but when I became a man so there came a time of M of spiritual maturity when I became a man I put away childish things if you take things away from immature Christians they'll resent you for it but you let them grow and mature huh you don't have to to uh you know have them all tow the line right now tell them the truth I'll never forget the the brother up in in Canada that was there uh and you know he was a semi-pro softball player and uh Russell he's part of your family well anyway David and uh wow this guy was good some of you guys are good but this guy was good well any anyway he gets converted hey he I think he saw a spoken word book on your table got interested in it huh how many of you keep spoken word books around your house how many of you read them don't just have them on the Shelf but read them he he got well what is this he starts reading now elect seed election election has something that has an ability inside whether before you knew it or not there was something inside of there that was to receive and he begins to read there's something about that that quickens his attention wow where did you get this and stuff so Russell made contact with me he said well he he lives up there in Prince Albert not far from you uh why don't you invite him to church we did long story short he gets converted but brother Ron sorry you know sometimes just can't make it because I got to play ball yeah yeah got to play ball man you know that's serious stuff you know when you're in it and that's what you're doing to you that's real important huh so I didn't sit there and say well I'll tell you what son and just go into it and read him the right act no I knew and he said brother Ron I'm out there one one day when I should have been in church and I'm out there in the outfield hey better better hey hey swing all what am I doing out here this is stupid Lord see he he came to it himself so you know what I didn't take it away from him what he did he gave it to God God don't take most of the issues you have away from you you give it to him it's a sacrifice when Jesus Christ bid you to come he bids you to come and die it is a self sacrifice you give it to God Amen too many people said well God I've got this problem and I have this issue and God you take it away from me no you give it to God amen amen amen otherwise it be too easy right oh yeah God I I I have this problem and I have this addiction I have this that I can't give up and everything like that God take it away from me okay spoiled rotten brat that's all you'd be so then God Waits until you get so sick and tired of that thing that is vexing you that you get in desperation when godone guess what then God delivers you brother Bram said isn't it a pity that a lot of times it takes us to get into desperation to call God on the scene amen another uh portion of scripture Hebrews 6 veres 1-3 now I want you to all understand that Paul is trying to get the church and remember Paul comes along a little bit later after there's already been these Apostles and disciples and everything like this and he has a a a Damascus experience and he goes and gets alone with God for three years and when he comes out he finds out that he's preaching the and having the same understanding as the disciples and so Paul being the first church age messenger okay he was the one that God is going to reveal some things and even the disciples said Paul preaches things that's hard to be understood I was caught up into the heavens and whether in the body out of the body I don't know and on and on I mean Paul had so much Revelation that God allowed him to have a thorn in the flesh huh he asked God God take this Thorn and my flesh away he said no my grace is sufficient I want all of you to understand God don't take every Thorn you got away no some of it is there huh to Humble you how many of you just start thinking you're doing so good and you're so great and you your walk is so good and God owes you the kingdom of heaven and you deserve to go into Rapture and all of a sudden you fall flat on your face and go God God give me Grace huh amen Hebrews 6 verse1 amen imagine him teaching this therefore leaving the principle of the doctrine of Christ what leaving the doctrine of Christ are you kidding me therefore leaving did did you guys read that say it therefore therefore Paul I ain't never going to forget that [Music] therefore thanes when you begin to see the word of God and it unfolds it's a continual unfolding brother Ram says the reason we have so many divisions and so many things among us is because of the lack of this understanding that God God's word continually unfolds if we'll put a Comm instead of a period we might even get along with one another by well you don't see it like me well that's okay I'll pray until you do see it like me no stop it you might be ahead of me you might need to be praying for me listen my brother and sister the Bible says when they are comparing themselves among themselves they're not wise so let us get a little bit of wisdom let's not be like my son Matthew when we came home in Germany that time and he was like the second or third from the bottom of the class and his words was hey mom guess what there were two other boys under me I beat two of the kids out of 30 like we're supposed to Rejoice on that but that's kind of how we do don't we look at one another I'm I'm not like him I at least come to church on Sunday morning yeah I know Wednesday night yeah yeah do you see what I'm saying we're measuring ourselves by ourselves measure ourselves to the word of God Amen so he's saying therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on onto perfection now that word Perfection and that that's kind of a a word that is Mystical uh among many message Believers because we tend to think that we're going to be actually perfect and walk around and nothing bother us you're in a bubble you're a Nirvana nothing bothers me love love love just everything No Nonsense that's not the Perfection he's talking about maturity yes look let's let's go beyond these things so we can come to the maturity that we can understand the things that God wants us to understand not laying again watch this not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith towards god wow these are major subjects that a lot of times are preached on over and over in the church but we're never say hey let's go beyond this now we how many of you understand repentance towards God Amen I got it how many of you Faith Amen to I got it but let's go on Amen and of the doctrine of baptisms not baptism baptisms now we know that there is a water baptism and a spirit baptism we know the Bible says and many of them in the Old Testament were baptized un Moses Moses baptized no one amen right it says baptized un Moses Under the Red Sea and everything no they came under his anointing his baptism of his anointing they were under but with many of them God was not well pleased seeing that what they heard they did not mix it with faith and many of them fell in the wild I wonder how many that are hearing this message of the hour and not mixing it with faith but you're getting understanding you're getting knowledge the Bible says there'll be some that forever will learn but never coming to the knowledge of Truth the doctrine of baptisms baptism of water and a baptism of fire John said I indeed baptize you unto water unto repentance but the one coming after me his baptism is far greater so he's putting an emphasis on the one coming after me I just preach to you the kingdom of God and tell you to repent but there's one coming after me whose baptism is far greater because he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire so the doctrine of baptisms and of the laying on of hands isn't it amazing how a lot of times people people will divide over little issues do we lay hands on people or do we not would yes of course but let's go beyond see he's trying to get them to a higher understanding amen and I'm going to show you some quotes later I'm not going to do it tonight but brother Brenham says Hey for every one person that comes to the platform in a prayer line he said there's 50 out there that get to healed that's right he said it's a 50 to1 ratio that's amazing you don't need a prayer card you don't need to come up here you don't need us to lay hands on you you just have to have faith so he says so God gives him the gift of of healing and discernment to get the people's attention I don't know you sir I don't know where you're from come here that's okay that that you're just feeling at Presence come here all of a sudden he drops into this realm and he begins to discern are those things true yes yes wait just a second I see you and you're this and that are those things true now I don't even remember what I said he said I'd have to go back and listen to the tape now what he's doing here's a prophet I want you to understand he can go back into time or forward into time because his gift allows him to enter into that Eternal realm so now he's using this gift and the people that are sitting out there that maybe are in question themselves and and brother Brandon will say and he's the same yesterday today and forever are those things true sir why how many of you believe how many of you yes sir why you out there in the blue shirt yes God is just touch you you out here and you and next thing you know what they were doing they saw the The Works of God they were moved in their faith they came into the realm and all of a sudden man people are getting healed everywhere he sent his word and it healed the people I will get into that later and explain that just a little bit further so the doctrine of baptism laying on of hands and of the Resurrection then and of Eternal judgment this we will do if God permits well God help and permit us to go beyond certain doctrinal things that we tend to want to fight over you know God help us have a right attitude amen have a teachable spirit one thing I can't stand it's a know it all yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well what about the yeah yeah yeah yeah well what about this over yeah yeah yeah yeah we hired a guy at ralson panus said he he put on his resume he's got like five years on a forklift five years hey once you've driven one forklift they're all pretty much the same up down sideways lift all that right so this guy comes I say okay we'll go out there and move some pallets gets on this thing like this hey he didn't have the slightest idea I said okay come over here let me let me show you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I know I know okay I watch him he can't get it I said hey come here let me just give you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I know so after about the third or fourth time I said yeah yeah yeah yeah you're going to get fired if you keep telling me you know it all amen I said you're a liar you ain't got a half hour on a forklift now if you want to keep your job you want to be taught yeah yeah yeah yeah proof was in he didn't know how to drive one he just I needed the job I said okay you can you know if you will learn God help us to quit being no it alls within the message and to learn amen right attitude all right I want to title this the revelation of the son of man part three and I don't know how many parts I'm going to have maybe till the Rapture because this the the revealing of the son of man is of the utmost importance to each one of us amen it's not learning this message it's not uh learning Church order it's not those things they're important knowing how to dress and pay your ties and all of those things those things are important yes they're a part of the message but let's go on unto Perfection and we will do that the Lord willing if he permits now sometimes I'm a little factious no I'm not going to stay on a certain subject forever because I tend to think that we get into a rut but the revelation of the son of man may I tell each one of you that it was not until I had a Damascus experience with God yes the Lord had had had dealt with me I come into the message got baptized I got the Holy Ghost and everything but we got into a rut of just going to church and it wasn't until I got sent over to Europe and I was put alone in an office and I had for the first time in my life chronologically all the tapes from 47 to 65 I never had that before back then um there was some you could order some tapes and get them in the little packets like five sermons at a time soon as you paid for that you got your next one any of you remember any of you old enough to remember that yeah it was it was nice and and so that's how we did because we couldn't afford listen most of the time we were just paycheck to paycheck so we couldn't afford to to get a complete set of tapes so now for the first time iow where do I start I started megga doing Here's the the real truth of the matter while I'm pack packaging books and I am sending packages of tapes and books around the world I'm listening to tapes my I tell you wow I'm having such a epiphanies from God I stopped oh wow praise God I mean sometimes it gets so outstanding that that I'm sorry it's the old lingo it's mindblowing I just go wow and then I realize that the more I know and the more God gives me Revelation the less Revelation I have cuz you know what God's too vast that's right how can I attain it that's why job said oh that I might get all the learning that I come to Perfection no it's not it no God is so great he's so vast but the patterns and the examples throughout the Bible are all there now I'm talking on the revealing of the son of man and I want to go into this subject just for a little while tonight of we're seeing the greater things we're seeing the greater because Jesus said oh because I I told you behold an Israel Israelite and whom there is no gu does that make you a message believer well I want to ask you where are all the people under the first and second pull because that was an attracting pull third pull is not third pull is offensive does this offend you yeah I tell you what tell me to eat your flesh and drink your blood you got to be a cannibal and the Bible says and many of his disciples walked no more with him they said this is a hard saying so remember now that the third pole the revealing of the word is separating just like Paul said this morning when you see God revealed this that then he separates and it comes up here this that God reveals in the days of Luther comes God reveals everything they organize God separates we see that all down through the scripture so God could not bless Abraham until he separated from lot sometimes it's going to take you to separate from some of those that are holding you back amen if you're going to get better at tennis play somebody that's better than you that's right huh if you want to be a better singer or a better piano player find somebody that knows more than chopsticks find somebody that challenges you amen amen that's why my brother my sister we come to church to BR to be brought into remembrance but also to cause you to come up higher every teacher that I ever had in school that was a good teacher and that I enjoyed was thought-provoking was one that actually made you want to learn that instill I do not like a teacher okay open the the uh textbook let's go to page 35 and it's just as dry as anything and who you couldn't wait to get out of the class but those that were teachers that inspired listen everybody liked the teacher that inspired and you know what you had to you had to really press it to try to get in that class class oh I had a few teachers that let me tell you were outstanding rest of them I I don't even know remember what grade I'll be lucky to know was it a male or female but I've had some that were outstanding so it is even in the message there will be different ones that you will go and you will hear and there will be abundance of words and they'll use quotes and they'll think that the reading of the quote and the louder the voice and here's what he said is anointing now brother Paul loveall he found a quote the other day talk about that Supreme anointing I've shared this quote with you but he said really the Supreme anointing he says you would think it would be all kinds of emotion and screaming and hollering he said no he said when God comes down he said Jesus Took the scroll read where it was at here he was under Supreme anointing close the book and sat down wow he says it's Supreme anointing under control he said you know some people like to toot the whistle but he says he said a real train puts the steam to the track not yeah H predestiny yeah elected and you ain't going nowhere he is tooting your horn brother Ram said even the other example you know we talk about well it's noise and I Let's Make A Noise unto the Lord and really there was all kinds of noise and stuff yes I understand that but brother brandham said now you watch he said when that wagon comes down the street and it's empty and it goes over that cobblestone he said making all kinds of noise he said but put a big old load of hay on it or some wood he said comes down the same street so a lot of times all of this stuff listen I do like to get excited I like that little bit of noise I don't want people to be dead I don't want you to just sit there huh but I want you to interact I want you to say Amen break the sound barrier once in a while you'll help the minister you'll pull the sermon out of me so Paul's trying to get them get this understanding Paul's trying to get them to come to a higher level of understanding let's go beyond these things wow so God reveals himself in Tim relased Revelation I preached that years ago not only here at at my own church but the time I was up there in Idaho brother Paul you remember that bunch of the we up there I think Ted Pedley asked me to take a some meetings in Idaho and he said brother Ron I got little up there and will you have come up and go to the meeting well brother Ted is not real good at responding to emails and different things and finally about a month before I said Ted you haven't told me anything about it now either you get back to me or forget it I'm not going so immed like that so anyway I went up there and I preached time relased Revelation and you know how I got it I went I I started to get a cold and when I and when I go to the pharmacy I don't look for weak I look for super duty heavy strength knock it out of the park baby type stuff am right yeah so I went there and I got this super duper Time released man pills you take a you take this pill and you know what it works three hours and 4 hours and 12 hours later it's still pumping and yeah man that's what I need I need some time release stuff so I take this back and man I'm popping this thing and you talking through my nose and you can't really speak and I said man I need something anyway what happened I I the Holy Spirit I'm praying I'm seeking the Lord what do I uh Time released Time released Time released yeah I have yet many things to say unto you but seeing you cannot bear them now so as you get older and as the Holy Spirit comes to you I will release unto you a revelation and you'll come come to a mature thinking you'll come to a mature understanding and it'll manifest in your life amen hallelujah thank you Lord time release Revelation destroy this temple in three days he didn't explain it in fact it wasn't until after the resurrection oh oh it wasn't that Temple was the Temple of his body Eat My Flesh and drink my blood oh it wasn't until later wow but you know what a lot of the people got offended and they walked no more with him third pole is offensive third pole doesn't explain it third pole causes you to get into it and say Lord I don't understand what he just said but I believe it huh there are things that are going to be preached to you that you won't catch it at that time but you know what it's put on your hard drive it's in your memory and the Holy Spirit at some time will bring to your remance oh yeah I remember what he preached and sermons that you don't remember had no effect sermons that you don't remember the title who preached it when but sermons that had an effect on you that caused you to to get right with God or something like that you remember who preached it whether it was Sunday morning Sunday evening you remember the scripture it's amazing I can go back to Europe and I can go to somewhere that I haven't preached in 15 years and there's four or five people that say wow brother Ron we haven't seen you in 15 years I remember when you preached here the threshing floor did I preach on the thring floor yeah you did man it was so good and David danced before the ark but when they came to the threshing floor of ornan and The Oxen stumbled and and usua grabbed the ark and the anger of God slow and David quit Dancing see it looked like everything was in order but it was on the wrong oxcart amen it was on an oxcart and not over the hearts of the Levites brother Bram What's the title of the sermon trying to do God a service see a lot of times saints of God it's not the emotional thing but it's the word of God revealed to you and I love it when sermons when ministers preach a sermon now brother Paul you were you were Dynamic this morning in a sense you didn't have to raise your voice you didn't have to be demonstrative you didn't have to beat on his you didn't have to no just teach because it was coming out and you know what if you throw it near me I'm going to catch it huh if you're a good ball player hey man just hit it out in left field I got it man am like so it's not necessarily how loud there's nothing wrong with being loud there are ministers that can't preach without being loud that's okay that's that's them I'm not I'm not going to slide them I told one brother I would not like to be in your church because every time you got to be loud and you got to this and you got to sweat I I I said if I had to go and hit a home Runner Grand Slam every time I come to the pulpit because there are times when it's going to be more perspiration than inspiration huh come on you know what we're talking about you your own lives huh you come to church sometime you've been in a battle guess what song leader gets up there let's all stand well how many of you uh are happy to be in the house of the Lord it's a good thing we can't read your thoughts you really want to know the truth sometimes I catch it and you know what I want to I want to say this to all of you as a pastor I'd love to see all of you enter in sure I do quite honestly I love to see all of you enter in and when we have a song service I I want to say this to those of you who do enter in I love it I love it I love to see somebody enjoy what they're singing and even if you're going through a hard time to praise God anyway it's not because you're having a good time and you got money in the bank and your wife loves you and your kid loves you and your dog loves you and everything is going good no there are times when you're going to be in stocks and bonds you got you you you're in a trouble things are going upside down why don't you just curse God and die there are times when you just don't you come to church and guess what you've been beat up you've been threshed and you you ain't all that happy you're just there because you know you should be there but at some time yeah at some time because I believe that God works in mysterious ways how many of you know that more demons are cast out by the ministering of the word than by laying on of hands so we could have somebody up here come up here and God miraculously delivered them but guess guess what 50 to one there'll be more people out there oh praise God I got it there are times when God gives you a revelation and and here's a mysterious thing when the woman who had an issue of blood and she had gone to many Physicians and he spent all of her money trying to get well and she had heard about Jesus and there wasn't a prayer line there wasn't anything it was just a throng of people wanting to see Jesus and they were all pressing in on him and all of a sudden Jesus said who touched my clothing who touched me now I want you to understand this because we don't play this side of the record all of the Holy Ghost fi disciples missed the move of God Amen true sometimes we can be so busy with church and with singing with things going on that there can be a service going right there and somebody reaches out and touches him during the word being preached and hallelujah hallelujah and they get delivered and nobody knew it and here she had a issue of blood she touched the Hem of His Garment and Jesus stopped and he said who touched me and Peter that spokesman puts his foot in his mouth more than what do you mean who touched you can't you see everybody's touching you he said but virtue he said ver he said somebody touch me different so sometimes they can be in a service that's going on and Jesus is there he's walking among you but it depends on how you touch him and there can be just it seemed like a not a great move of God and there's there's just things happening and and all of a sudden somebody while the preacher was preaching Somebody Touched Me Hallelujah you understand now Jesus said who which one of you which one of you touch me because you touch me different he said virtue one of the seven virtuous Redemptive names of god Jehovah JRA Jehovah RFA Jehovah Shalom Jehovah Nissi whatever virtue you needed all of a sudden you stopped virtue left my body I know somebody touched me and she knowing that she could no longer hide herself she comes she admits it was me he says according to your faith that's right who touched me according to your faith that's what I'll share with you here in the next couple Services we'll see how them but who touched me it's according to you your faith it's not that you need somebody you know there there are times I'm not against that laying on of hands Paul wasn't against laying on of hands and of Faith towards God and of baptisms you he he you think he's doing away with it no he's taking you to a higher understanding that you'll see greater things that's what Peter was telling the disciples there hey just cuz I told you your name where you're from Wow greater things shall you see you're going to see the son of man you're going to see a revealing of angels ascending and descending do you realize we are living in the day of Revelations 10 1-7 the mighty Angel descending Revelations 107 being ascending up into do you see us Angels ascending and descending what was it the revelation of the son of man was not William Brown he says I'm just the vessel I just happen to yield myself the revealing of the son of he said but you know some of them they made him the son of man he said no no no no are you the son of man he said no I'm a son of man I'm one whom the word of the Lord comes to I'm a son of man revealing to you the son of man that though he speaks the revelation of God as it's given to him except we be moved on by faith we sit there and we try to understand it we log it into our hard drive and you know what that's okay you come to church you're not going to understand it I I it's like in a classroom in every classroom and every teacher can bear you witness of that you have some students that are accelerated huh they read faster they do their math faster and there are some that are slow so you the teacher those are accelerated students teacher said okay you go read this this they got it okay and the others okay come here see dick Run Spot runs after the ball yeah yeah yeah good good good keep reading yeah and they need help nothing wrong with that that the teacher goes well you dumb stupid kid what's wrong with you you can't even read why that teacher is never going to help that student said no no no that was good that's good you can do better come on come on sound it out sound it out I like all of you to understand that God sometimes lets you come into situations where you have not exhausted your resources first in other words have you prayed over it have you sought God have you really meditated and asked God to give you an answer are you just one of these well hurried up God give it to me because you know what I don't want I don't want to wait spoiled rotten braten we're in a we're in a time where everything's fast food fast this fast this hurry up people they'll shoot you at McDonald's man at the drive-thru that because you got cold fries how would you like to you know what how would you like to work at McDonald's uh can I help you sir my fries are cold got to be kidding me how much do they make an hour you got to be kidding lay your life on the line for fries I'm not trying to be funny happening every day amen somebody they don't like it they didn't get it fast enough get it hot enough I didn't get enough McNuggets sorry anyway I don't mean to get off on that stuff but it's the truth that's right God an oak tree does not grow overnight you know what grows overnight mushrooms you can go like this fungi that's all they are they're a little germ and fungi and they grew up overnight and everything look at me I'm doing great where' they go they came to church two or three times in a row where are they now brother Samuel we need to have root within us we need sermons like what brother Paul was talking about this morning hey let me tell you that was good for every one of us sit there look at ourselves and when we admit and we point the finger back at ourselves and say I was wrong it takes a big man to admit you were wrong I'm just glad I've never been wrong yet I have to keep you laughing once in a while just you know you you guys know that I I don't really mean that do you know you would not have fellowship with yourself 15 years ago that's right cuz you just didn't have it you weren't catching it you were still on the sincere milk of the word and you weren't catching the deeper things and somebody else wants to fellowship with you and you're still on Gaga stuff you're on baby padum no no that's why the Apostle Paul says hey look sincere he says that fresh meat belongs to those who are of full age huh got got some chers here that's why God gave them to you that's why babies are not born with teeth most of them I know there are a few kids that have had a tooth or two but it would be awfully uncomfortable on Mama okay so but there Comes A Time comes a time when teeth start coming and they get a little agitated you got to put stuff on their gums and and everything children everything because you know what everything is SE taste smell feel so they see their feet for the first time their hands everything is TA everything and taste is one of those areas that they put everything in their mouth they find something on the floor no no they go out on the lawn they see something they can see a snail okay you know what I'm talking about he says strong meat belongs to those who are of of full age this is where I believe that saints of God we've got to have the spiritual maturity Jesus said I have so many things I want to teach you seeing you cannot bear them now I'm glad that he just didn't stop there and said you sorry outfit you guys that don't get nothing you're so such slow Learners no no he says look but the time will come now let me give you a quote here musicians if you come because I'm going to go we're going to go in I I never I'm just on page two I got 10 or so that's okay we'll continue sermon never quits we just continue huh brother Paul ain't that the truth we yeah it's a NeverEnding sermon guess what it's going to never end when we get over there God's going to continually unfold oh thank you Lord my that's the truth brother Brenham questions answers 9 and 57 now someday I'm going to leave here I'm wondering what will be my end is it over is it just about I'm 48 years old 48 48 I ask a a brother out there after the baptismal I was talking to him I said hey are you 60 yet 60 do I look sick he was so offended I said don't don't take offense to it cuz he's asking me about my my uh surgery on the eyes I said do you know what floaters are I said most of the people 60 years of age and older are going to experience floaters little things in your eyes it starts with a little flash all of a sudden there' be a Flash and it looks like somebody's trying to pass you at night you go oh what what was that or is that lightning I I remember seeing these flashes well that signs that there's things going on in the retina of your eye so I told the man I said you know hey are you 60 I was just making a point I said anybody 60 and older now brother Brenham thought that 50 years of age if you don't believe me go type in I'm getting to be an old man 50 years of age 50 now he says 48 he says what would be my end I'm 48 wow now when you're 1848 that guy is Ancient of Days yeah you young boys Marcus I'm an old man going to be 71 [Music] man I used to think hey the prophet how old was he when he passed away come on 56 56 years old when I was 18 56 seemed like he had his day he was there now I'm going to be 71 next month I'll be 71 now I think 48 I wish I was back to 48 I'd be out there running those bases with those boys playing baseball yeah I tell you what yeah come on man I remember the last time that I went to play ball with the with the church yeah Paul you'd have love this I got up there cuz I used to play ball man yeah he come on man watch me I'm going to smack this thing watch it I hit a grounder went to the short stop and I started running to first base I started leaning forward and I do a Superman slide halfway and I pile up I was never so embarrassed I told John dubsky who Tri me I said run my body said no when I was a child I spake as a child so the revealing of the son of man is a process you don't get it overnight you don't pass go and collect $200 this is Monopoly no no no this you are going to go and you're going to go from stages of a little bitty babe in Christ you're going to grow you're going to fall you're going to make mistakes you're going to go from grade one to grade two to grade three you're going to go through those things and yes you're going to mature hopefully CU there are [Music] some that never did mature they just grew bigger and didn't mature and that's sad when you see that God help us to have the maturity in Christ and the revealing of the son of man it continues it goes on it does not stop it continues it keeps going God bless you all uh brother Mark I'm going to have you to sing a song here I'm going to get ready here uh I didn't even think I would

made mistakes yeah we all have we're not doing practice sin no but what we're doing we're kept confessing our faults to God coming here and so let a man eat of that bread and drink of that cup because he that eateth and drinketh unworthily that's why what we do tonight you take a moment you say oh Father maybe I haven't been living just the way I should maybe I've done some things that I'm not really proud of maybe the flesh has gotten in the way but father I want you to cleanse me put it under the blood right now father and we confess all of our faults and we say oh God come and cleanse us and then you have a right to come and take of that bread and drink of that cup 1 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus in the same night in which he was betrayed took bread they call this the last supper it's the last time he's going to have us he said this is the last time I'll not eat and drink again until we come to the wedding supper here he is the same night which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doe in remembrance of me he's breaking the word because he is the bread which came down from heaven after the same manner he also he took the cup and when he had slept saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come excuse me wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthy shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep what cause not Discerning Lord's body for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world where my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come all right you said I I have some gloves here [Music] okay [Music] [Music] is these the bread go ahead take the lid off this if you Brethren will hold that let us all bow our heads heavenly father I hold in my hands this

won't use the LEL mik St John chapter 13 verses 1-1 17 excuse me now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world under the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end that's one of my most favorite scriptures amen he loved them unto the end and supper being ended and the devil having now put into the heart of judas's scariot Simon's son to betray him it went from his head to his heart and now he betrays him you understand that now the devil having put into the heart he thought about it but now it puts it into his heart to betray the Lord Jesus no knowing Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he porth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord does thou wash my feet and Jesus answered and said to him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Time released Revelation you don't know it now later you'll Peter you'll catch it one day Peter saith in him Thou shalt shall never wash my feet and Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou has no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only also my hands and my head and Jesus say to him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean ever with and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had given his taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet is this a commandment of God this is not a suggestion that's why everybody should be here everybody that claims this to be their Church unless they got for some reason they have to to work or whatever you ought to wash one another's feet I've done this I've given you example do it for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done unto you verily verily I say you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that sent him greater than he that sent him than he that has sent greater than he that has sent him if you know these things happy are you if you know them what was it Steve if you what if you do them it's not saying it it's not acknowledging it it's doing it amen let us do what he said do I speak not of you all I know whom I have chosen that the scripture may be fulfilled and he that eateth with me hath lifted up his heel against me now I tell you before it come that when it come to pass you may believe that I am he verily verily as send you he he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me so tonight we're partaking of foot washing for those of you you who have not here been here with us again follow our Deacon sisters you
