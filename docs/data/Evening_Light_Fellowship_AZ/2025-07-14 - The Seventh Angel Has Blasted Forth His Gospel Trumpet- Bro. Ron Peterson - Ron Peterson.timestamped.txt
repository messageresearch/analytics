[8:43] [Music]
[8:48] Amen. And our request this morning, we
[8:51] have several needs today that we would
[8:53] like to present to you. But Psalms 118
[8:58] says, "It is better to trust in the Lord
[9:01] &gt;&gt; than to put your confidence in man."
[9:04] &gt;&gt; It is better to trust in the Lord to put
[9:06] confidence in princes.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; Do you trust in the Lord today?
[9:10] &gt;&gt; That is one thing you can trust in is
[9:12] the Lord Jesus Christ. Cuz he gave his
[9:15] life for you and I today. We trust in
[9:17] him and for all things this morning. May
[9:20] that be an encouragement to you. Trust
[9:22] him. Whatever you're going through, just
[9:24] trust him.
[9:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's a he's a rock. He's a shity.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; He's our everything today.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to remember the needs this
[9:34] morning. Please pray for traveling
[9:36] mercies for brother Billy Silva and his
[9:38] family. We remember them. We have a lot
[9:40] of people that are traveling. Uh Sister
[9:42] Monica says this morning, "Please pray
[9:45] for s sister Mary. She's in been in the
[9:48] hospital at Thunderbird. Uh she'd be
[9:50] there. She will be there peace
[9:52] prayerfully
[9:54] for a couple of days. Uh visitors make
[9:57] her very happy. Uh she had a little
[9:59] complications
[10:00] with some pneumonia, I believe, and
[10:03] she's doing much better and we thank the
[10:04] Lord for that." So remember to pray for
[10:06] sister Maryanne. I guess the Lord will
[10:08] touch her. Uh we want to brother James
[10:10] says please pray for my little
[10:12] sister. Her name is Alex uh Puit. Alex
[10:16] had her baby six weeks early and she is
[10:18] struggling to gain some weight and she
[10:20] needs a feeding tube. We're believing
[10:22] for complete healing. So let's remember
[10:24] the Torren's brother James's little
[10:27] sister. We want to remember brother
[10:28] Steven McNeely. He's up in Edmonton and
[10:31] brother Eugene Bronze preaching this
[10:32] morning. remember him and as he flies
[10:34] home uh later today or tomorrow want to
[10:37] remember all the other saints that are
[10:39] traveling.
[10:40] Brother Ron would like us to remember
[10:41] his brother Don. Don has been sick with
[10:44] diarrhea for over a week and he is very
[10:46] weak and he's unstable as he walks. So
[10:48] let's remember Don Peterson. The Lord
[10:50] would touch him and give him a healing
[10:52] touch. Brother Mario and Sister
[10:54] Josephine would like us to remember
[10:55] Bethl today. She's at home not feeling
[10:57] well. Let's remember her. Sister Terresa
[11:00] Bonard says, "I would appreciate the
[11:01] church body to pray for me for a serious
[11:04] unspoken request. May the Lord just give
[11:06] her guidance with that situation."
[11:09] Sister Suzanne
[11:11] Peterson says, "My mom met with her
[11:14] surgeon a little while back and his
[11:17] words were, you are healed and we are so
[11:20] thankful for the prayers of the saints."
[11:22] So we thank the Lord for that this
[11:23] morning. What a testimony. We had prayer
[11:26] for sister Martin and the Lord came her
[11:29] by her way. Do you have a need today?
[11:33] [Music]
[11:35] &gt;&gt; We're a needy needy people, but he's a
[11:37] God that can touch every need at the
[11:39] same time. Hold your need up. I'm

[11:43] Brother Warren, will you come take these
[11:45] needs to the Lord? Amen. Let's hold our
[11:48] needs up. I'm already healed.
[11:52] Hallelu.

[12:01] the Lord.
[12:03] The battle is over.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; Victory is one.
[12:10] It's already done.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; How many of you are weak and weary
[12:20] today?
[12:21] God can see your uplifting hands.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; May we cannot
[12:31] write our needs today, but he knows our
[12:34] needs. He knows our hearts.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; Father, there's so many requests,
[12:42] so many names.
[12:45] But Lord, you said you know our names
[12:47] before the foundation of the world.

[12:54] own good Lord for your own praise
[12:57] father. So that we can lift up our hands
[13:00] and say truly God healed me.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; Truly God I wrote the request and God
[13:07] answered my prayer.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; Lord we cannot trust man. Curse is the
[13:12] man that trusted in man, but blessed is
[13:15] the man that trusteth in God.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, that's you're the only one that we

[17:10] my feet on higher ground.
[17:14] I want to scare
[17:16] the sky
[17:19] and catch a
[17:22] glory.
[17:24] But still I'll pray
[17:27] till heaven I come.
[17:30] Lord lead me on to high. That's our
[17:33] request today. Lord, lift me up
[17:37] and let me stand
[17:40] my faithful
[17:43] land
[17:48] that I have found
[17:52] on higher ground.
[17:58] Amen. There's a song I'd like to sing
[18:00] now. We haven't sing it for several
[18:02] years, but there's a purpose behind this
[18:04] song because there's promises. I am
[18:06] determined to hold out to the end.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; Are you determined to hold out to the
[18:11] end this morning? Because in the end, we
[18:14] have blessings untold. Amen. You that
[18:17] know this song very well, sing loud.
[18:19] Amen. Let's let's sing this song as we
[18:21] worship the Lord. Amen. We'll start with
[18:24] the chorus.
[18:27] I am determined to hold out till the
[18:30] end. And Jesus is with me on him. I
[18:35] can't. And I know I have salvation. For
[18:39] I feel it in my soul that I am
[18:43] determined.
[18:45] First verse, first verse. And when I
[18:48] first found Jesus, oh something
[18:52] like lightning, it went through me and
[18:55] glory filled my soul. Salvation made me
[18:59] happy and took my fears away. And when I
[19:04] meet old Satan to him, I always say I am
[19:09] determined to hold out to the end. And
[19:13] Jesus is with me on my hand. And I know
[19:19] I have salvation for I feel it in my
[19:22] soul.
[19:26] So hold on to the end. And Satan was so
[19:30] angry and said he'd send me back. Just
[19:34] let the path go narrow and he will lose
[19:37] the track. And I'm so full of glory. My
[19:42] Lord, I always find and I just say to
[19:45] Satan, old man can me because I am
[19:50] determined
[19:52] to the end. Oh Jesus,
[19:57] I can't
[20:00] know I have salvation for I feel it in
[20:03] my soul.
[20:07] So pulled out to the air and this old
[20:10] time religion makes me sometimes shout.
[20:15] I don't have time to gossip or any kind
[20:18] of power. They say that I'm too noisy.
[20:22] But when these blessings go, I shout,
[20:25] "Oh, hallelujah.
[20:27] I want the world to know. I am
[20:31] determined
[20:33] down to the end. Oh Jesus is with me. On
[20:38] him I can care. I know I have salvation.
[20:43] Feel it in my soul. I am determined.
[20:49] Last earth. And when I hear the trumpet
[20:53] oh sounding in the sky and see mountain
[20:57] trembling to heaven I will fly. For
[21:01] Jesus will be calling. There'll be no
[21:04] time to fear. With joy I'll go up
[21:07] singing. I held out. Amen. I am
[21:12] determined
[21:14] about the end. Jesus is with me. On him
[21:19] I can't. And I know I
[21:23] know I feel it in my soul. I am
[21:27] determined to hold out to the end.
[21:31] [Applause]
[21:33] When pains of death is on my soul, I do
[21:39] love the Lord. I cry
[21:42] until Jesus came and he made me. I would
[21:48] not would not be
[21:51] I would not I would not be enough.
[21:58] Oh, I could not be
[22:03] till Jesus came anymore.
[22:08] I would not be
[22:12] and as
[22:15] in
[22:18] I
[22:22] [Music]
[22:24] stand with a cur
[22:29] upon you. Amen.
[22:33] I would not be
[22:38] would not be enough.
[22:42] [Music]
[22:48] I would not be
[22:51] as thirst and old Satan said my Lord
[22:57] and would not hear my pray
[23:02] but praise the Lord the word is not in
[23:08] Christ the Lord is amen
[23:13] could not be enough
[23:17] for I would not be
[23:21] [Music]

[29:08] But in his image I was made before the
[29:12] foundations were laid.
[29:15] Oh,
[29:17] and I'm of a super race who beheld our
[29:21] father's face.
[29:24] Oh, I'm not of this world.
[29:29] I was expressed into time. I came from
[29:33] the Lord. I came from another world. to
[29:38] be an end time.
[29:41] I'm only here for a little while to
[29:45] prove and manifest his life from another
[29:49] world.
[29:53] I'm going back to that eternal world.
[30:00] Oh, I came from another world unseen to
[30:04] human eyes.
[30:07] I'm from another world. A parallel you
[30:12] never.
[30:13] [Music]
[30:15] And right now I'm standing here. But if
[30:18] you dance about your eyes,
[30:22] oh, I might just disappear in the
[30:26] twinkling of an eye.
[30:29] Oh, to that other world,
[30:34] that eternal world,
[30:38] so I'm not of this world.
[30:42] I was expressed into time. I came from
[30:46] another world
[30:48] [Music]
[30:50] sent to be an end time.
[30:54] I'm only here for a little while to
[30:58] prove and manifest his life from another
[31:02] world.
[31:05] I'm going back to that eternal world.
[31:12] I came from another world where I'm
[31:16] influenced to praise
[31:20] by my theophony
[31:22] that is singing to me.
[31:27] And there's a quickening power that is
[31:31] rapturing me
[31:35] to a heavenly place in a supernatural
[31:39] atmosphere.
[31:41] Oh,
[31:43] in that other world,
[31:46] that eternal world.
[31:49] Oh, I'm not of this world.
[31:54] I was expressing two times. I came from
[31:59] another
[32:02] sent to be an
[32:06] I'm only here for a little while to
[32:10] prove the manifest
[32:12] light from another world.
[32:17] I'm going back to that eternal world
[32:22] of this world.
[32:26] I was expressed into time. I came from
[32:30] another world
[32:32] [Applause]
[32:34] said to be an anti.
[32:38] I'm only here for a little while to
[32:42] prove and manifest the light from
[32:45] another world.
[32:49] I'm going back to that eternal world.
[32:54] I'm only here for a little while to
[32:58] prove and manifest the life from another
[33:03] world.
[33:06] I'm going back to that eternal world.

[35:29] Like the sound of many
[35:32] waters,
[35:35] it's the sound of worship
[35:38] coming from
[35:41] the throne.
[35:46] And there are cries of adoration
[35:50] [Music]
[35:52] as men from
[35:56] nation. What do they do? They lift their
[36:00] voice

[38:00] from this world.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; But we're going only through here on a
[38:04] journey.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is a time of testing and
[38:07] approving of which seed we belong to
[38:11] &gt;&gt; and of which land that we're going to. I
[38:14] Father, I thank you and I praise you and
[38:16] I love you this morning.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; I pray that you will anoint your speaker
[38:21] and the hearers and may the Holy Spirit
[38:24] have preeminence in this service. We ask
[38:27] it in Jesus Christ's name.

[38:41] church business to take care of this
[38:43] morning and we have a family that's
[38:45] going to be moving and they I want to
[38:48] pray over that family. It's brother uh
[38:51] Matt and Sister Jackie Fielding. They're
[38:53] going to be uh moving to Ohio. And so
[38:57] would you guys uh come forward? I was
[39:00] going to sing bring them in, bring them
[39:01] in, but
[39:03] that's for a different
[39:06] different blessing.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Certainly enjoyed that song special this
[39:18] morning.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Wow. That that's some revelation behind
[39:21] that song.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just uh in this world
[39:25] temporarily.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:28] Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this
[39:30] world."
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Hey, buddy. Yeah. Yeah.
[39:38] Yeah. You know, I think everybody wants
[39:40] to be able to see you guys. We're going
[39:42] to have you just line up right here.
[39:44] Right here. Yeah. Yeah. We'll get the
[39:46] cameras on you guys.
[39:49] Yeah. Look at Hey, look at them smiling
[39:52] real big and everything, huh?
[39:54] Well,
[39:57] brother Matt and and sister Jackie have
[40:00] been praying about some things. And let
[40:02] me see here. Let's get a microphone
[40:04] here. And let's go ahead and we'll let
[40:07] uh brother Matthew, go ahead and tell us
[40:10] a little bit about what has uh brought
[40:12] about this decision and what you're
[40:15] going to do. And and uh we love you
[40:17] guys. You have been such a special
[40:19] family to us.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Lowmaintenance sheep.
[40:24] Amen.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah, every pastor loves low maintenance
[40:27] and everything, but we know that you've
[40:29] suffered through some things and endured
[40:33] and everything, and we know that the
[40:35] will of God will never take you where
[40:37] the grace of God can keep you. Tell us a
[40:40] little bit about your decision, please.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; So, uh, well, Jackie's had some health
[40:44] issues for a while and, uh, doesn't like
[40:46] living in the city, and that's never
[40:48] been a secret for any of us. You know,
[40:50] she was grew up in the country in
[40:51] Montana.
[40:52] um just poured her heart out to me for
[40:54] the last couple years about wanting to
[40:55] move. And um I was like, "No, we have
[40:58] church, we have work, we have a good
[41:00] interest rate on the house." Like, we
[41:01] weren't going anywhere, right? And so,
[41:04] uh uh she finally just went to the Lord
[41:06] and prayed and said, "Lord, you have to
[41:07] speak to him." And uh
[41:11] or to me, to both of us. And uh
[41:15] yeah, she he could have said no. So, uh,
[41:19] not without going too long, but, um, uh,
[41:22] we we got that leaning. We we got a word
[41:24] from him and, uh, so we just kind of
[41:27] leaned that way and knocked on a door
[41:29] and and the first door was our business
[41:31] to go and so we put that up for sale
[41:34] thinking I was thinking months. This
[41:36] thing ain't going to sell. Two weeks to
[41:38] the day it sold. And so that I I became
[41:41] unemployed at that point. And so, uh, it
[41:44] was really a confirmation of God wanting
[41:46] to do this. in and why Ohio. It's a
[41:49] different bit of a climate. We know uh
[41:50] Brother Chad's church out there. Brother
[41:52] Ron has good things to say about him.
[41:54] And so we're really moving for um for
[41:58] the word really is what it is. And it
[42:01] wasn't because there's anything wrong
[42:02] here. It's just because there there was
[42:05] this desire on her heart to move. And so
[42:07] if we're going to move, we've got to go
[42:08] to church somewhere. And where do we go?
[42:10] And so that that was the biggest thing
[42:12] in in in our decision process. So here
[42:14] we are. Um, we've got they've got one
[42:17] more Sunday here and then uh they'll be
[42:20] flying out and my oldest son Gideon and
[42:22] I will be mid August before we leave.
[42:24] So, um, that's kind of
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Give him a hand.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Well, you have been a very, very special
[42:40] family, a special blessing to us and
[42:45] Don't,
[42:50] &gt;&gt; but you go with our blessings.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a little bittersweet
[42:56] &gt;&gt; how that we love you.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you too.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; But uh I've ever had
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And uh but uh we know that that
[43:11] life has different chapters and
[43:14] everything and you are certainly now in
[43:17] a new chapter of your life and we're
[43:19] going to be asking God's riches
[43:21] blessings to be with you and we want you
[43:24] to know that you're more than welcome to
[43:26] come back uh at any time because this
[43:29] will always be home.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; So we're just loaning you for however
[43:34] long that you're going to be there. We
[43:36] love you guys. You've been very, very
[43:38] special to us.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; And so, you go with our blessings. And I
[43:42] think that any pastor when he loses or
[43:46] loans the sheep out to another shepherd.
[43:51] Um there's always a something that goes
[43:55] with his heart with them. And so we want
[43:58] to pray over you and we want all of you
[44:00] to to How many of you have been blessed
[44:03] by brother Matthew and Sister Jackie?
[44:06] Huh? Yeah. Such a lovely family. All
[44:10] right, kiddos. Come gather together.

[44:15] going to pray over you now. Heavenly
[44:18] Father, as I bring uh Brother Matthew
[44:21] and Sister Jackie Fielding, their little
[44:23] family. Father, what a wonderful time we
[44:26] have had together. Sojouring here down
[44:30] here on this earth, but we know, Father,
[44:32] that you um you have plans in lives and
[44:37] uh things change and uh we go other
[44:41] places, Father, but we know that the
[44:43] will of God will never take us where the
[44:46] grace of God will not keep us.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray that a great blessing
[44:50] upon their family. Watch over them. Keep
[44:53] them, Father, in the center of thy
[44:55] perfect will. I pray, oh God, that they
[44:58] will uh find joy, peace, ha, happiness,
[45:02] health, all the things that they're
[45:04] desiring. Father, we just place them
[45:07] into thy hands. And as Abraham sojourned
[45:10] and he looked for a city whose builder
[45:13] and maker is God. Father I pray let them
[45:16] sojourn father temporarily in this world
[45:20] Lord because they're seeking a whole
[45:22] another city that is from heaven. Father
[45:25] I bless them now and I send them with
[45:27] our blessings in the name of Jesus
[45:30] Christ.

[46:15] that do whether it's our deacons,
[46:17] trustees, whether it's the sound men,
[46:20] whether it's the musicians or anything.
[46:22] I am extremely blessed
[46:26] &gt;&gt; to have all of you to be here with us.

[47:00] you back. Brother Johnny and Sister
[47:02] Linda, it's good to have you back. And

[47:24] gone just a week. going to take some uh
[47:27] meetings up there with brother Abel
[47:29] Musango in Portland, Oregon. Um up there
[47:33] it's his anniversary. He's pastor of the
[47:35] church up there and uh so uh Kate Rose,
[47:40] our granddaughter is going to go with
[47:42] us. So we're looking forward to that and
[47:44] everything. God bless you all this
[47:46] morning. Let's stand together.
[47:53] I'd like you to turn with me in your
[47:55] Bibles if you would please
[47:58] to the book of Joel,
[48:01] chapter 2. We'll go to Joel 2. Then
[48:04] we'll go to Joel 3.
[48:06] And then we'll go to numbers.
[48:20] Joel chapter 2
[48:24] vers 15- 16.
[48:29] Blow the trumpet in Zion.
[48:32] Sanctify a fast
[48:35] and call a solemn assembly.
[48:39] Gather the people, sanctify the
[48:42] congregation.
[48:44] Assemble the elders and gather the
[48:46] children and those that suck the
[48:49] breasts. Let the bridegroom go forth of
[48:52] his chamber
[48:54] and the bride out of her closet. Notice
[48:59] that this trumpet is signifying.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; It's fast. It's calling an assembly.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand that this
[49:10] calling of the assembly is extremely
[49:14] unique because now we see the that the
[49:17] bridegroom is coming forth
[49:21] &gt;&gt; and that the bride is coming out of her
[49:24] closet.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; It's an awakening time.
[49:28] It's a positioning time.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me. Joel 3
[49:36] verses 9-14.
[49:42] Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles.
[49:46] Prepare war.
[49:48] Wake up the mighty men. Let all the men
[49:50] of war draw near. Let them come up.
[49:53] Beat your plowshares into swords.
[49:57] and your pruning hooks into spears.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Let the weak say, I am strong.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Assemble yourselves and come, all ye
[50:06] heathen, and gather yourselves together
[50:09] round about. Thither cause thy mighty
[50:12] ones to come down, O Lord.
[50:17] Amen. Put in the sickle, for the harvest
[50:20] is ripe.
[50:22] Come, get you down, for the press is
[50:24] full, and the fats overflow, for their
[50:27] wickedness is great.
[50:30] Multitudes, multitudes in the valleys of
[50:33] decision.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; For the day of the Lord is near in the
[50:36] valley of decision.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; The sun and the moon shall be dark and
[50:40] the stars shall withdraw their shining.
[50:43] The Lord also shall roar out of Zion,
[50:48] and utter his voice from Jerusalem, and
[50:52] the heavens and the earth shall shake,
[50:55] and the Lord will be the hope of his
[50:58] people, and the strength of the children
[51:01] of Israel.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to notice there in verse
[51:05] 9, proclaim ye this among the Gentiles.
[51:09] Prepare war, and wake up the mighty men.
[51:13] Turn with me to the book of Numbers.
[51:14] Let's go back in your Old Testament
[51:18] here. The book of Numbers,
[51:24] chapter 10.
[51:28] Numbers chapter 10.
[51:31] I first want you to notice, I did not
[51:33] give it to the brethren, but you have
[51:35] your Bibles open. If you notice uh verse
[51:38] two,
[51:40] make the two trumpets of silver of whole
[51:43] peace thou shalt make them thou shalt
[51:46] that thou mayest use them for the
[51:49] calling of the assembly
[51:51] and for the journeying of the camps.
[51:54] Two trumpets
[51:57] made the same way. One is for the
[51:59] calling of the assembly and the other is
[52:02] the journeying of the camps.
[52:06] So we believe that we have heard a
[52:08] trumpet in this hour
[52:11] &gt;&gt; and it's gathered us together for a
[52:14] solemn assembly
[52:16] &gt;&gt; and we're waiting now for the final
[52:18] truck
[52:20] &gt;&gt; which will be the journey
[52:22] &gt;&gt; of the camp.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together now?
[52:25] &gt;&gt; So we see it in scripture. Turn with me.
[52:27] Here it is in verse n. And if you go to
[52:30] war in your land against the enemy that
[52:34] oppresseth you, then you shall blow an
[52:37] alarm with the trumpets, and you shall
[52:40] be remembered before the Lord your God,
[52:43] and you shall be saved from your
[52:46] enemies.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless the reading of his
[52:50] word. You may be seated this morning in
[52:52] the presence of the Lord.
[52:57] Now
[52:59] I would like to take a title this
[53:02] morning
[53:03] that the seventh angel has blasted forth
[53:06] his gospel trumpet.
[53:09] I want all of you to be acutely aware
[53:12] that it is that trumpet that you have
[53:15] heard. This message that you are
[53:19] completely aware of has affected you.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Absolutely.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; That's why we have been called out of
[53:31] denomination.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; And into the glorious light that God has
[53:38] sent in this hour.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; And I would like to take a subject this
[53:44] morning. The shout has gathered the
[53:46] mighty men to prepare war.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as I've been studying and
[53:51] seeking the mind of the Lord on this,
[53:54] uh, I've been looking through the
[53:56] scriptures all the way from Genesis to
[53:59] Revelation. And we see that there's all
[54:02] kinds of wars.
[54:04] We see Israel was troubled with wars
[54:10] not only within Israel itself within
[54:13] their own camp but we certainly see the
[54:17] enemies round about them.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; We see that when they went into the
[54:21] promised land
[54:24] that they had to fight for the land.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; It was a battle. Brother Bram said
[54:30] you're going to have to fight
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. for the land that you possess.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; You are not called to a picnic. You are
[54:39] called to a battle.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Now, as I begin to go through this and I
[54:46] I gave Thank you, brother Robert.
[54:49] As I gave some of uh these scriptures
[54:53] and I I told the brothers I would refer
[54:55] to this in the book of Revelation.
[55:00] If you all want to just make a note of
[55:02] this or turn back real quickly in your
[55:05] Bibles to the book of Revelation, we're
[55:07] going to find out that there is
[55:10] continual verbiage of war.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; I want you to see this in Revelations 11
[55:19] and 7. The Bible says, "And when they
[55:21] shall have finished their testimony, the
[55:24] beast that ascendeth out of the
[55:26] bottomless pit shall make war against
[55:29] them."
[55:30] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand there is war
[55:32] happening around us and we must be aware
[55:35] of spiritual warfare.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelations 12 and 17. And the
[55:42] dragon was wroth with the woman and went
[55:45] to make war with the remnant of her seed
[55:49] which keep the commandments of God and
[55:51] have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
[55:53] Again we see make war.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Revelations 13 and verse 4. And they
[55:59] worshiped the dragon which gave power
[56:02] unto the beast.
[56:04] And they worshiped the beast, saying,
[56:06] "Who is like unto the beast? And who is
[56:09] able to make war with him?" Revelations
[56:14] 13 and 7. And it was given unto him to
[56:16] make war with the saints,
[56:19] and to overcome them, and power was
[56:21] given him over all kindreds and tongues
[56:25] and nations.
[56:27] Revelation 17 and 14.
[56:30] These shall make war with the lamb.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; We're talking about warfare.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; And these shall make war with the lamb,
[56:40] and the lamb shall overcome them, for he
[56:43] is lord of lords and king of kings,
[56:46] &gt;&gt; and they that are with him are called
[56:47] the chosen and faithful.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Revelations 19 and 11. And it says, "And
[56:54] I saw heaven open, and behold a white
[56:56] horse, and he that sat upon him was
[56:59] called faithful and true."
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; And in righteousness, he doth judge and
[57:06] make war.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Revelations 19 and 19.
[57:12] And I saw the beasts and the kings of
[57:14] the earth and their armies gathered
[57:16] together to make war against him that
[57:19] sat on the horse and against his army.
[57:23] So I want you to see that even the book
[57:27] of Revelation, we know that the Bible
[57:31] speaks of wars and of rumors of wars. We
[57:33] see that we're in the time right now
[57:35] where Matthew 24 is being filled around
[57:38] us. We see all kinds of wars and
[57:41] distress among nations. We even see a
[57:45] civil war happening right here in the
[57:47] United States.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; True.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Our country is fracturing.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; It is falling apart.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; And a
[58:00] a company that is not together if it's
[58:04] divided will sure surely fall. Sir,
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "There's coming a
[58:10] time judgment's going to strike
[58:11] America."
[58:13] &gt;&gt; I believe that the reason we have not
[58:15] seen the judgment strike America like it
[58:19] will is because the bride is still here.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; And he said she is represented by a thin
[58:26] film of of blood that covers the earth.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; And it says, "And so the judgments of
[58:33] God cannot penetrate through that."
[58:36] Okay? Because there is representation of
[58:39] blood. But once that blood is taken,
[58:42] &gt;&gt; then let me tell you, death and hell
[58:45] will come upon the earth, there will be
[58:47] tribulation as never seen upon the
[58:50] earth.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, if there's ever a time that we need
[58:54] to be serious with God, let us be
[58:56] serious with God now.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm going to take a
[59:01] different approach to the u this
[59:07] uh
[59:10] speaking about war and about the opening
[59:12] of the seven seals.
[59:15] I want you. So when I take this
[59:18] viewpoint,
[59:21] I want you to actually understand that
[59:24] every time a seal was broken,
[59:27] there was an exposing of Satan and his
[59:30] plan.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; So may I say this so that you will
[59:37] understand the opening of the seals is
[59:40] actually the complete exposure.
[59:44] Hallelujah.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Of Satan, his plans.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; What he started from the beginning until
[59:50] his very end. There's two books in the
[59:52] Bible Satan hates the most.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; He hates Genesis because it shows where
[59:57] he came from. It shows where he started.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; And he hates Revelation because it shows
[1:00:04] where he's going.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; I tell you, if the devil ever tells you
[1:00:10] and and and condemns you of your past,
[1:00:13] remind him of his future.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:21] So
[1:00:23] right now around the world
[1:00:26] there are many message believers
[1:00:30] that are talking about the open book the
[1:00:33] opening of the seals
[1:00:36] talking about Revelations 10 1-7
[1:00:40] then going into Revelations 10:8 where
[1:00:43] John was commanded John being a type of
[1:00:46] the bride
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; to take the book and to eat did.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; And so we find out that this opening of
[1:00:54] the seven seals is a complete exposure.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Of Satan and his master plan.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; He wants to ascend himself above the
[1:01:07] throne of God.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; He wants to be called the most high.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; And he's doing everything he can to
[1:01:15] deceive the people on the earth. And the
[1:01:18] brother Brennham said, "The reason the
[1:01:20] bride cannot be deceived is because the
[1:01:24] bride's absolute is the scripture."
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Now, some have told me, brother Ron, our
[1:01:30] message is the absolute.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Well, let me tell you, the Bible is
[1:01:36] God's thumbum.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; But the reason that we put such emphasis
[1:01:40] on on this end time message was because
[1:01:44] his absolute. Right?
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; His absolute was the word of God.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Because a prophet can never add to, take
[1:01:54] away.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; But he will reveal those things, the
[1:01:58] mystery truths
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; that God has hid down through the ages.
[1:02:03] But now is being revealed.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; And what what excites all of us now
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; is we're a part of that mystery. Amen.
[1:02:11] Thank you.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Each one of you
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; have been affected.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; If you haven't been as yet, you should
[1:02:20] be
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; to understand that this message
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; and the supernatural things, angels,
[1:02:30] visions, prophecies
[1:02:33] are all coming to pass right now before
[1:02:36] our wondering eyes.
[1:02:39] My, what an hour to be living in.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; This is the crescendo.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; This is the climax.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; And yes, I very much rejoice about the
[1:02:56] opening of the book, the mysteries being
[1:02:59] revealed. And we can see that a lot of
[1:03:02] times people want to jump and shout and
[1:03:06] dance about because of what has
[1:03:09] happened. But I want to play another
[1:03:12] portion of this and make you acutely
[1:03:15] aware.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; We're in a battle.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; And the reason that each seal was
[1:03:23] opened,
[1:03:25] it declared a war.
[1:03:28] So understand that
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; that this is spiritual war
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; and all of you have got to be prepared
[1:03:38] for it.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Even Joshua was told by the Lord teach
[1:03:44] your children war.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; He says for those that came out of Egypt
[1:03:50] knew what it was like to have had wars
[1:03:53] and had task masters. But those that
[1:03:57] were raised
[1:03:58] in the message on the journey
[1:04:02] did not know why.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; In fact, many of them had not even been
[1:04:07] circumcised.
[1:04:09] And Joshua was told by God, "Go and take
[1:04:13] Israel and circumcise them again." And
[1:04:17] he says, "How can I do it? If they've
[1:04:19] been circumcised, how can you do it
[1:04:21] again?" He said, "The children of the
[1:04:23] wilderness." Now listen to this.
[1:04:26] The children of the wilderness are a
[1:04:29] type of those that have been raised in
[1:04:31] this message,
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; not knowing the fightings and disputings
[1:04:37] that we had with denominations
[1:04:39] which were spirits.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Are you aware? Spirits.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; That's why this voice in this age said,
[1:04:47] "Come out of her, my people.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Be ye separate, saith God.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Lest you be partakers of her place."
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:56] Yeah.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; So this prophet's ministry became so
[1:05:01] supernatural
[1:05:03] that it caused quite a stir among
[1:05:07] denominations and they all invited him.
[1:05:10] They tried to figure him out. Are you
[1:05:12] oneist? Are you trinitarian? Are you
[1:05:14] Baptist, Pentecostal? He said, "Well,
[1:05:16] I'm Baptist as long as you stay with the
[1:05:18] word. I'm Pentecostal." He goes on and
[1:05:20] on. Well, I'm actually Baptist,
[1:05:21] Pentecostal, Lutheran, Methodist.
[1:05:24] See, because what he was doing is
[1:05:26] saying, "Hey, look, don't put me into a
[1:05:29] certain
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; way."
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Because everybody tries to, you know,
[1:05:36] figure something out. And what are you?
[1:05:39] Where did you come from? Where did you
[1:05:41] get this message? Let me explain to you
[1:05:44] that this message was not William
[1:05:46] Brennham.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "Against my own better
[1:05:50] judgment, I wanted to go and be a
[1:05:52] trapper.
[1:05:54] But God kept him. Wouldn't even allow
[1:05:56] him to commit suicide when he was so
[1:05:58] distraught
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; at the death of his wife and his baby.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; He went through but he could not do it.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:06:11] God was keeping him. Why? He wasn't done
[1:06:14] with his ministry.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Why? Because of you and I.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; God so loved you. wouldn't allow him to
[1:06:22] do what he wanted to do. He says, "Hope,
[1:06:26] I'm gonna see you in just a moment."
[1:06:28] Took his glove off. You all know wanted
[1:06:30] to grab that highline.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; I'll see you in just a moment. His heart
[1:06:34] is breaking.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Sharon Rose,
[1:06:40] daddy's going to see you in just a
[1:06:41] moment. He looked down and he saw an
[1:06:43] imagery of him on the power pole, his
[1:06:47] arms stretched out, and he said,
[1:06:48] "There's Christ."
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Oh, God, forgive me. I
[1:06:52] can't take it anymore."
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Took his glove off and he found himself
[1:07:00] at the foot of the pole.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; I want you to know that God
[1:07:05] supernaturally
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; wouldn't let him
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; do that because of you.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Because you had not been called out yet.
[1:07:14] He had not opened the seals. He had not
[1:07:17] finished his ministry. There was no
[1:07:19] vindication of his ministry as yet. The
[1:07:21] third pole had to come.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; The vision must be fulfilled. And we're
[1:07:26] a part of that vision, are we not?
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Behold, I sent unto you, Elijah.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; How many of you take that personal? He
[1:07:36] sent it to me.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; You see, they began to tell the prophet,
[1:07:44] just come to the meeting, work your
[1:07:45] gift, but don't preach because Yeah,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; you're you're ignorant and unlearned.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; My
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; they didn't want him to preach. See,
[1:07:57] they No one was offended. I want all of
[1:07:59] you to understand, no one was ever
[1:08:01] offended by the miracles, by the signs
[1:08:05] and wonders. No one was offended by
[1:08:08] healing except for the Sadducees,
[1:08:10] healing on a Sabbath day or something
[1:08:13] like that. They always wanted to find
[1:08:15] fault with Jesus. Amen.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; But they were these signs and wonders,
[1:08:23] whether it's water to wine,
[1:08:26] whether it's fishes and loaves,
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; it was an attraction, was it not?
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; No man can do these things except that
[1:08:33] God be with him.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; And so we see
[1:08:37] that he's changing his ministry. And
[1:08:41] when he changes his ministry, it becomes
[1:08:44] offensive.
[1:08:46] And now the multitudes had followed him.
[1:08:48] It says that many said, "This is a hard
[1:08:52] saying. Who can hear it?"
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; And they walked no more with him.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; St. John 666.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; And so we see that when Christ changed
[1:09:04] his ministry
[1:09:07] that it was an offense.
[1:09:10] And I want you to understand that the
[1:09:13] prophet of God when he changes his
[1:09:15] ministry,
[1:09:17] it became an offense to denominational
[1:09:21] spirits and they closing the doors
[1:09:24] everywhere.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; 1956, brother Brennham has
[1:09:31] God give him a vision and tells him
[1:09:33] about first, second, and third pole.
[1:09:35] Talks him to him about a tent. talks to
[1:09:38] him about fishing, talks to him about a
[1:09:40] little room. I'll meet you in there. And
[1:09:43] so, Brother Brandham, remember now,
[1:09:45] brother Brennham is given all kinds of
[1:09:47] symbols. That's why people look for a
[1:09:50] physical
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; happening. They look for a physical.
[1:09:54] Well, listen. If the vision itself is
[1:09:57] physical, all of it will be physical.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? I want to ask you,
[1:10:03] when did brother Brennham try to lace
[1:10:05] that baby shoe with a rope?
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Never happened. What was it? A symbol.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; What about that little room?
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenam said, "Well, I'll meet
[1:10:16] you in there."
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; And then Brother Brandham asked the
[1:10:19] angel, "What do you mean that little
[1:10:21] room? Why in there? Why there?" He said,
[1:10:24] "Because is it not written in the
[1:10:26] scripture?" See, going back to
[1:10:28] scripture,
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; to enter into thy closet. I want to ask
[1:10:32] you, where was Elijah's prayer closet,
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; wilderness,
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; a cave, a mountaintop?
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; He's getting away from people
[1:10:41] influences.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Huh? I tell you, if you ever want to get
[1:10:45] a hold of God, get away from people. Get
[1:10:48] alone. Get somewhere where you can fast
[1:10:51] and pray and seek the mind of God and be
[1:10:55] away from all kinds of influences.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; So we see
[1:11:04] there and let me just bring this to you
[1:11:06] as a warning that when the opening of
[1:11:10] the seals happened,
[1:11:13] it was an exposure that Satan hated.
[1:11:17] Amen.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; And so it declared a war,
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; And so now, Brother Brennan was saying,
[1:11:27] and I I I want to lead into this,
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to show you in the
[1:11:34] scriptures, but I have a hard time
[1:11:36] because there's so much that I want to
[1:11:37] say. All right.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; When a sword is drawn from its sheath in
[1:11:46] scripture,
[1:11:48] it is a declaration of war.
[1:11:51] Ezekiel 21:es
[1:11:54] 1-5.
[1:11:56] Here we go. And the word of the Lord
[1:11:58] came unto me, saying,
[1:12:00] Son of man, set thy face toward
[1:12:02] Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the
[1:12:06] holy places, and prophesy against the
[1:12:08] land of Israel, and say unto the land of
[1:12:12] Israel, thus saith the Lord, behold, I
[1:12:15] am against thee, and I will draw forth
[1:12:17] my sword out of the sheath. Notice this.
[1:12:20] What's he doing? Declaring war. Whenever
[1:12:23] a sword appears
[1:12:25] and it's drawn,
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; I will cut off from thee the
[1:12:33] righteousness and the wicked, seeing
[1:12:35] then that I will cut them off
[1:12:38] off from thee the righteous and the
[1:12:40] wicked. Therefore shall my sword go
[1:12:42] forth out of the sheath against all
[1:12:44] flesh from the south and to the north
[1:12:47] that all flesh may know that I am the
[1:12:49] Lord have drawn forth my sword out of
[1:12:54] his sheath.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; It shall not return anymore. What God is
[1:12:59] doing in this age, what do you think the
[1:13:01] prophet is doing in Sabino Canyon?
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; He's up there. What happens? A sword is
[1:13:07] unchath.
[1:13:10] It strikes his hand.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "I thought it's a sword." He
[1:13:14] said, "It's not a sword.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; It's the king's sword." He said, "This
[1:13:19] is that third pull."
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; This is what you've been praying about.
[1:13:24] I'm showing you. This will be the
[1:13:26] vindication of your ministry. What God's
[1:13:29] doing.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. Put your spiritual thinking cap
[1:13:32] on. He's unchath the sword. He's
[1:13:35] declared war. Yes sir.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; I trust you see it friends.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; What is the attraction on the mountain
[1:13:48] 65? I went up in the canyon, climbed
[1:13:51] plum up where the eagles was flying
[1:13:53] around. I was watching some deer
[1:13:55] standing there. I knelt down to pray,
[1:13:57] raised up my hands, and a sword struck
[1:14:00] my hand. I looked around. I thought,
[1:14:02] "What's that? I'm not beside myself.
[1:14:06] Here's that sword in my hand, bright,
[1:14:08] shiny, glistening in the sun. I said,
[1:14:12] 'Now, there's not people in miles of me
[1:14:15] way up here in the canyon. Where could
[1:14:17] that come from? I heard a voice said,
[1:14:20] "That's the king's sword."
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; I said, "A king knights a man with a
[1:14:26] sword." Now, watch his thought.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; I want you to know he's actually kned.
[1:14:33] Yeah,
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; this sword. God is knighting
[1:14:38] this messenger with a word. I dub thee.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10 and seven.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; I dub thee a messenger. You are to take
[1:14:51] the king's message to the people.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] And the voice came back,
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; not a king's sword,
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; the king's sword.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; said, "Fear not. It's only the third
[1:15:11] pull. It's the vindication of your
[1:15:14] ministry."
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you all of you to understand
[1:15:19] that prophets are given visions
[1:15:23] and visions are symbols. The book of
[1:15:25] Revelation is a book of symbols.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; It's white horse rider and a black horse
[1:15:32] rider and so on and so forth and and
[1:15:34] trumpets and seven golden candlesticks
[1:15:38] and on and on. Those are all symbols
[1:15:41] that represent something. Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; So, I don't want you to get your mind uh
[1:15:47] let's say your hard drive locked up on
[1:15:51] thinking
[1:15:53] about something physical.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; I want you because God is his own
[1:15:58] interpreter.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; God can interpret his word or the vision
[1:16:04] that he gives
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; himself
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; by bringing it to pass
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; and it may be totally different than
[1:16:11] what you thought.
[1:16:12] Amen.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; So, a lot of times what we do is we get
[1:16:15] preconceived ideas because somebody's
[1:16:17] taught you, well, he's got to do this
[1:16:19] and therefore this means that and over
[1:16:22] here and therefore we got to go and we
[1:16:24] got to look for a physical tent.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Well, why don't you take the overall
[1:16:31] picture and see that he's talking about
[1:16:34] a change in ministry.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Not about a physical 10. It's about a
[1:16:39] change in ministry. I'll meet you in
[1:16:42] there. You're good at this and that. No,
[1:16:44] don't you know little fish and bigger
[1:16:47] fish and you all know the visions,
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; So
[1:16:53] only the sword of the spirit
[1:16:56] can divide between the soul and the
[1:17:00] spirit.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Theology can't do it.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Seminary education cannot do it. and
[1:17:08] religious teaching cannot do it.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; It will take someone who has
[1:17:14] supernatural ability
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; able to receive supernatural
[1:17:19] instruction.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; In fact, brother Brennham said, "These
[1:17:23] people, I will call them the initiated."
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; They're brought into something. Why?
[1:17:32] Why did that song that you sing up here,
[1:17:35] let it be on be more than just a song.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not of this world.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; I came from another kingdom.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going back to that kingdom.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; I'm on a journey right now. I haven't
[1:17:50] completed my journey. Hallelujah.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; But I'm going home.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Why? Because my father is drawing me.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; I cannot be stopped. Why? It's his
[1:18:02] doing.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; It's his watching over his own promise.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; He's watching over his seed.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; God's always watched over his seat.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 33:es 1-7.
[1:18:23] Again, the word of the Lord came unto
[1:18:25] me, saying, Son of man, speak to the
[1:18:26] children of thy people, and say unto
[1:18:29] them, when I bring the sword upon the
[1:18:32] land,
[1:18:33] if the people of the land take a man of
[1:18:36] their coast, and set him for their
[1:18:38] watchmen, how many of you have heard the
[1:18:40] sermon, watchmen, what of the night?
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; He said, what is it God ordained men
[1:18:45] that he's placed on the wall?
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Watchmen,
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; what of the night? Yes. Amen.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; And if he seeth the sword come upon the
[1:18:57] land, he blows the trumpet and warns the
[1:19:01] people. Notice the watchman catches
[1:19:03] something.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Then whosoever heareth the sound of the
[1:19:10] trumpet and taketh not warning, if the
[1:19:12] sword come and take him away, his blood
[1:19:15] shall be upon his own head.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; He heard the sound of the trumpet and
[1:19:20] took not warning.
[1:19:22] That's right.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; His blood shall be upon him, but he that
[1:19:26] taketh warning shall deliver his soul.
[1:19:29] Are you listening?
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; This message is a warning.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the message of the
[1:19:38] hour.
[1:19:40] If the watchman see the sword come and
[1:19:43] blow not the trumpet and the people be
[1:19:46] not warned. If the sword come and take
[1:19:48] away any person from among them he has
[1:19:51] taken away in his iniquity his blood
[1:19:54] will I require it the watchman's hand.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; So thou son of man I have set thee a
[1:20:01] watchman unto the house of Israel.
[1:20:04] Therefore, thou shalt hear the word at
[1:20:06] thy mouth and warn them from me. I want
[1:20:11] all of you, oh house of Israel,
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; spiritual seed of Abraham.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; I want you to know that there's been a
[1:20:20] watchman that has been sent in this
[1:20:22] hour.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; And he's preaching a message. He's
[1:20:26] blowing forth a gospel trumpet.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; It is a warning. It's urgent.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:33] It's declaring something's happening.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; This message, may I say it, is God
[1:20:44] blowing a gospel trumpet
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; in this hour.
[1:20:49] this messenger when he begins to declare
[1:20:51] his me not when he starts
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; but when he begins to enter into his
[1:20:56] ministry
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; he said I've mixed this if world
[1:21:00] evangelism and
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; prophetic gift said what good has it
[1:21:05] done
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; yeah come on
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; he says now I I want to go into the
[1:21:11] center of God's perfect will
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; you you realize that prophets when they
[1:21:17] enter into the perfect will of God
[1:21:21] that there is an urgency.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; About their message. Now they come out
[1:21:28] and they have thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; It's no more speculation. Well, I think
[1:21:33] it means this.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; It could mean that. No, they come out.
[1:21:36] It's thus saith the Lord.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:43] This message was circumcised
[1:21:47] with the opening of the seven seals.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; It was a sign given.
[1:21:53] It cut away Clarence Larkin.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; His love's two Babylons.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; The pre- niasian fathers.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; It cut away all of the knowledge of man.
[1:22:06] Because brother Bram said, "You all know
[1:22:07] I preached the seals before."
[1:22:10] He said I was a 100 miles from the
[1:22:12] truth.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; But now God, every time an angel came,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; each one when the first angel came, he
[1:22:20] came and broke to him the opening of
[1:22:22] that first seal. And what did he do? He
[1:22:25] said, "Oh my, it's not Christ. It's the
[1:22:29] Antichrist.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; It's an exposing of Satan.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Trying to come into the church, trying
[1:22:36] to conquer. Why? He's nickelan and he
[1:22:40] wants to divide and conquer. Let me say
[1:22:43] this. We are not divided. We have been
[1:22:47] united together with Christ and his
[1:22:49] word.
[1:22:51] [Applause]
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Why? It's a uniting time
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; and seed sign.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding? This message is
[1:23:00] not rules.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; It is not dressing.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; It is not church order. It's Christ.
[1:23:07] He is those seals.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Good preaching, brother. Amen.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; You go to answer and back like that, let
[1:23:21] me tell you, you'll get me to preaching.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on, brother. Preaching.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; This message I want you to understand is
[1:23:32] God blowing his gospel trumpet.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham, even on one tape he
[1:23:40] said, "This is no longer the voice
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; of William Brandham. It's a voice of
[1:23:44] almighty God."
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; he was just an instrument.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Romans 13:4.
[1:23:59] He is a minister of God to thee for
[1:24:02] good.
[1:24:04] But if thou do not which, excuse me, but
[1:24:07] if thou do that which is evil, be
[1:24:10] afraid, sir.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; For he beareth not the sword in vain,
[1:24:15] for he is the minister of God,
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; a revenger to execute wrath
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; upon them that doeth evil.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:26] Brother Brennham, now I want you to
[1:24:27] understand that the word of God is a
[1:24:29] sharp two-edged sword dividing.
[1:24:34] There's there's nothing
[1:24:36] that between the spirit and
[1:24:48] delicately
[1:24:50] took the word of the Lord said you could
[1:24:52] be anointed with the
[1:24:56] on your spirit be the Holy Spirit your
[1:25:01] spirit
[1:25:02] and he said in your soul.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Watch the level of anointing.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; He said in your soul on its way to hell.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; So he began to divide us. Oh, you spoke
[1:25:15] in tongues. You dance in the spirit. You
[1:25:18] prophesied.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean you got the Holy
[1:25:21] Ghost,
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; not on the soul. You got it on your
[1:25:24] spirit
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; because it is the activating the gifts
[1:25:28] of the spirit. Got nothing to do with
[1:25:30] the soul. But he says to show you when
[1:25:32] you've got it on the inside in the soul
[1:25:35] room, the control room.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Your control room is controlled by
[1:25:42] Christ the word himself.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; It's no longer
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; creeds and dogmas.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; He's in control.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:59] You can pray for the sick, cast out
[1:26:01] devils. You can do all those things.
[1:26:08] I want to ask you, the disciples were
[1:26:12] with Christ for three, three and a half
[1:26:14] years, been picked up, fishermen on the
[1:26:16] come follow me.
[1:26:18] He told them, I don't want you to
[1:26:19] rejoice that
[1:26:22] demons are cast out and you have control
[1:26:24] over them.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Rejoice that your names
[1:26:28] are written in this book of life."
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; There's the difference. Amen.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; So, here they were preaching,
[1:26:37] praying for the sick, signs and wonders
[1:26:40] following. And he said, "Peter, when you
[1:26:42] get converted,
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; so all of those things, okay,
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; had nothing to do with their soul being
[1:26:54] baptized."
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; So now I'm I'm I'm I'm going to take my
[1:26:59] time this morning by God's grace.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews 4:12, the Bible says, "For
[1:27:04] the word of God is quick,
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; and it's powerful and sharper than any
[1:27:10] two-edged sword."
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Piercing even to the dividing of sunder
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; of the soul and the spirit. Watch. Watch
[1:27:19] that word from that prophet.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; You could have it on your spirit.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; And you're It never touched your soul.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Because I can tell by the
[1:27:30] fruits. Amen.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; I can look at what you're feeding upon
[1:27:35] and I can see that your souls never had
[1:27:37] the control room
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; taken over by the master.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Of the joints and the marrow. So now
[1:27:48] it's the flesh and blood
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; between the joints and the marrow. You
[1:27:53] can have the anointing on the outer
[1:27:56] court.
[1:27:59] Y
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; you can have it on the inner court.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; You can speak in tongues.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; You can prophesy.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; You can do all kinds of things because
[1:28:13] the spirit activating you.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; But there's only one thing that'll
[1:28:18] change you.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not anoint you, not conform
[1:28:23] you, transform you.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Eight.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; A transformation, a metamorphosis.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; From earthly to heavenly.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Be not conformed, but be transformed.
[1:28:40] Metamorpho
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; to be changed. Hallelujah. All of you. I
[1:28:45] want you to understand you that have had
[1:28:48] the word of God that's come to you.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; It's changed you,
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; but it hasn't climaxed yet. Come on.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; It will shortly
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; moment
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; because in a moment, in the twinkling of
[1:29:06] an eye, we shall all be
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; changed.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; This mortal
[1:29:13] will put on immortality.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; The only part of you
[1:29:18] that has already put on immortality is
[1:29:21] the soul.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; The control tower.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; So now understand
[1:29:37] that it took the word of God to come and
[1:29:41] it's a discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:29:44] intents of the heart.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; That's why ministry of the word is a
[1:29:52] live ministry.
[1:29:55] I want you to understand when why do you
[1:29:57] come to church? Why do you gather
[1:29:59] together?
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Because if you will be under the right
[1:30:03] anointing,
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; if you'll be praying, if you'll be doing
[1:30:06] things, then God
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; can anoint the minister to say something
[1:30:11] and he doesn't even know why he said it,
[1:30:13] but it was God answering your prayer
[1:30:16] because you were pulling something down
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; from heaven and God was answering your
[1:30:21] prayer. Yes, sir. And you ought to say,
[1:30:23] "Thank you, God. You did it for me. I
[1:30:26] know why you said it. I know why you did
[1:30:29] it. That was for me, and I take it. It
[1:30:31] was mine. It was you given me my
[1:30:34] inheritance."
[1:30:36] [Applause]
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; That's why no minister takes any glory
[1:30:44] unto himself.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; If you have ever been helped, if you've
[1:30:49] ever been given a word, it wasn't
[1:30:51] because of me. It was because of him.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; It was because of your promise
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; that God gave you. He said, "I'll be
[1:30:58] with you
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; even in you till the end of the world."
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; That's why this prophet
[1:31:11] could discern.
[1:31:13] He says, "And people say I'm I'm against
[1:31:16] women.
[1:31:19] They call me a woman hater
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; because I tell them immoral clothes is
[1:31:25] wrong.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; I tell them cutting your hair, it's
[1:31:30] wrong.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Takes them back to the word.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; He says if you had the Holy Ghost,
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; he said it has to reverberate back.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; It has to resonate back. Amen.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:46] Because the Holy Ghost which rode the
[1:31:48] word
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; must say amen to it.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; That's why he says they call I don't
[1:32:00] hate women. He says I hate the wrong
[1:32:03] kind
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; of woman. He says they say I'm against
[1:32:08] people. I'm not against people. He says
[1:32:12] I love people. I'm against the system.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Well, but I go to church.
[1:32:21] My pastor told me and I'm up there and I
[1:32:23] sing in the choir
[1:32:26] and I have gifts operating and I do this
[1:32:30] and I do that. And he says, "No doubt."
[1:32:37] But it was this message
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; that began to divide in Joe.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; That man that came now please understand
[1:32:45] this saints. That man, a minister, a
[1:32:48] prominent minister brought his wife to
[1:32:51] meet the prophet.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "She's a saint." He said, "Oh
[1:32:58] my, I had such an expectation."
[1:33:01] He says, "And when she came before me
[1:33:04] with her dress and her fingernails and
[1:33:07] so on, I'm not going to go into it." And
[1:33:10] he says, "Oh my,
[1:33:12] it looks more like a hint."
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Than a saint,
[1:33:17] do you think that he's just being
[1:33:19] critical?
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; What it is is he's showing No, no, no.
[1:33:24] Cuz now this man being denomination, his
[1:33:28] wife is reflecting
[1:33:31] Mystery Babylon.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Mystery Babylon. So this man can
[1:33:38] vocalize. Oh, my wife is a saint. I look
[1:33:41] at her, it's contrary to the word. Can't
[1:33:43] be.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; It cannot be. Now we are fighting now.
[1:33:48] And I want all of you to understand that
[1:33:50] we are in the midst of spiritual
[1:33:52] warfare. And you need to know about
[1:33:55] spiritual warfare less you become the
[1:33:58] casualty in Laiusa.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; The government has turned against God.
[1:34:06] In fact, brother Bram said all
[1:34:08] governments of the world. Don't just
[1:34:09] think America.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; All governments of the world are
[1:34:13] controlled by the devil.
[1:34:15] And he said,
[1:34:18] he said, "If the devil can't get you and
[1:34:21] destroy your family, he'll use the
[1:34:24] government against you."
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Let me show you
[1:34:29] the hardest trial that prophet of God
[1:34:32] went until the pressure was put on him
[1:34:34] so great, he lied. Told his wife to lie,
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; tell him I'm not in."
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Stepped outside.
[1:34:43] What was the pressure from?
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; IRS.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; IRS.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, the government will
[1:34:48] come after you.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Because when Daniel,
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Daniel, when they said, "Well, there's a
[1:34:59] decree. The king has made a decree."
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Do you think that stopped Daniel?
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Open the windows
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; three times a day. He wasn't ashamed.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Huh? Let me tell you, my brother, my
[1:35:14] sister,
[1:35:18] they asked that that war admiral one day
[1:35:23] in a ship battle.
[1:35:25] They said, "Have you
[1:35:28] do you want to call a truce? Do you want
[1:35:29] to give up?" He said, "John Paul Jones,
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; we've just begun to fight."
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; A sword is for close quarters.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; This is not guns and rockets
[1:35:53] and atomic bombs.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; This is the sword that means it's close
[1:35:58] quarters.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Could come from your family.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I didn't come to bring
[1:36:04] peace."
[1:36:06] but a
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; if you love your father, mother, sister,
[1:36:11] brother more than me, you're not worthy
[1:36:12] of the kingdom.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you have to cut something
[1:36:16] loose.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; If your hand offends you,
[1:36:25] cut it off. If your eye offends you,
[1:36:27] pluck it out.
[1:36:30] Spiritual amputation. There are times,
[1:36:33] this is the word of God.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. There are times within your own
[1:36:37] family
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; that if your kids are not going to go,
[1:36:41] I'm sorry.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go on whether you like it
[1:36:48] or not. I'm going to go and serve God. I
[1:36:51] believe you'll change, but I'm not here
[1:36:53] to
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; p
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; pet and pamper you.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to give you some false
[1:37:01] hope.
[1:37:03] Well, I'm applying the token over you.
[1:37:06] Yeah. Well, unless you get under the
[1:37:07] token, you're not under it.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; That's the truth, brother.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; The two messengers
[1:37:20] that Rahab hid in her house, they said,
[1:37:22] "Okay." Because she said, "Give me a
[1:37:23] token.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; I'll give you a scarlet thread."
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And said, "But you know what? Unless
[1:37:30] your kids are under that same token or
[1:37:33] your family,
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; we're not responsible for what happens
[1:37:36] outside.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Understand that you young people don't
[1:37:40] don't sit there and let you have some
[1:37:43] devil tells you. Well, mom and dad have
[1:37:47] said they applied the token. Even though
[1:37:49] I live contrary to the word, even though
[1:37:51] I don't do, even though now, hey, let me
[1:37:53] tell you, you ain't going.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; You got to come yourself. It ain't
[1:37:58] because of your daddy. It ain't because
[1:38:00] you're a mama. It ain't because of the
[1:38:01] prophet. It's because you got a
[1:38:04] relationship born again. You've been
[1:38:07] filled with the Holy Ghost. You've been
[1:38:08] sealed.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:11] [Music]
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Government come against you.
[1:38:22] Church has rejected and put Christ out.
[1:38:26] Brother Renham said, "Behold, he stands
[1:38:28] at the door and knocks."
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "This is the first stage." He
[1:38:32] said, "Where Christ himself is not
[1:38:34] welcome in his own church."
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Put outside.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; He said the family unit has been broken
[1:38:44] up.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; He says family's become dysfunctional.
[1:38:49] Daddy's not taking his position, so
[1:38:51] mama's not taking hers.
[1:38:55] And the heart of the family is the
[1:38:57] husband and wife.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; I want you all of you to understand. So
[1:39:03] you guys got got married. Thank you.
[1:39:05] Praise God. You got the ring put on your
[1:39:08] finger. Go live happily ever after. No
[1:39:13] quarrels, no arguments, no fights, no
[1:39:16] nothing. You're going to live in Nirvana
[1:39:18] the rest of your life. Are you kidding
[1:39:20] me? That's a fairy tale.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:27] You know that to be the truth.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Just ask your parents.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Listen to their
[1:39:34] disputations.
[1:39:37] Brother Brim said, "Wouldn't you have
[1:39:38] liked to been a little fly on the wall
[1:39:39] of the tent in Abraham
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; and Sarah
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; or Moses
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; and Zapora?
[1:39:56] I thank God for a wife.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; I do. She's my helpmate.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; She is my help me.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; But
[1:40:08] nobody can press my button like she can
[1:40:10] either.
[1:40:16] Don't come against me. I'm the head of
[1:40:18] this house.
[1:40:20] Yeah. You know what she does? Oh, come
[1:40:22] here. Let me feed you.
[1:40:26] Don't touch me.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; No, I tell you. Hey, listen. We all have
[1:40:32] our issues.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Greg Alfred one time he told me he's
[1:40:35] from New Zealand. He said, "I and my
[1:40:37] wife have never had an argument."
[1:40:42] Oh, we've had some
[1:40:45] times of disputation and intense
[1:40:48] fellowship.
[1:40:52] That's why listen you you young people
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; realize that when marriage it's a
[1:41:01] combining of two natures
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; and and it's different.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; You think different.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; You act different. And if if you come
[1:41:14] from different cultures,
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; that's even worse.
[1:41:18] Okay.
[1:41:20] And so you try now you put the ring on
[1:41:23] the finger and live happily ever after.
[1:41:26] It don't happen. The reality is they say
[1:41:29] actually the honeymoon is over in about
[1:41:32] 3 years
[1:41:34] and then the reality of life sets in
[1:41:42] and it happens.
[1:41:44] I want you to understand that the devil
[1:41:47] tried to get to the first couple.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; He's going to try to do the same thing.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; He started with Adam and Eve.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; He ends with the second Adam.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; And the second Eve,
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; but he can't get between the two of them
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; because they're one.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They've been united together
[1:42:15] again. And he's her protector.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Why? She's laid herself like Ruth at the
[1:42:22] feet of Boaz.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Cover me.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Cover me when I am lonely.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Cover me when I'm not strong.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:44] cover me.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:42:52] in the sermon the junction of time. Now
[1:42:54] brother Brenham listen to sermon titles
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; because there it's a declaration
[1:42:59] junction of time. So now he says and
[1:43:02] Jesus Christ when he was here on earth
[1:43:05] says as it was in the days of Noah so
[1:43:08] will it be in the coming of the son of
[1:43:09] man. Right?
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; We have the highest
[1:43:14] rate of divorce
[1:43:16] than the whole than the whole world put
[1:43:19] together. We have more divorces. And may
[1:43:21] I say this? Do you know divorces are
[1:43:23] becoming even acceptable now among the
[1:43:27] message?
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; God is not for
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; divorce.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; But it happens.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:41] Why? We just come down here and
[1:43:44] we're human.
[1:43:46] We're people. We make people mistakes
[1:43:49] and we do things wrong. One thing I love
[1:43:51] about about Brother Brenam, now I'm
[1:43:54] going to say this. He says, "If you got
[1:43:57] the wrong one here,
[1:44:00] you'll get the right one over there."
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; He'll make all wrongs right.
[1:44:07] Do
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; you understand that?
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:10] So for every Adam
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; there is an equal Eve
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; she will be born of his bone
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; and flesh of his flesh
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; okay it will not be mixed
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; she will look like him
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; excuse me now he says we have the
[1:44:36] highest rate of divorce men the Bible
[1:44:38] Ible said would be marrying and giving
[1:44:41] in marriage,
[1:44:44] eating, drinking, the morals and so
[1:44:46] forth that they have. How that they
[1:44:48] marrying and giving in marriage in Reno,
[1:44:51] Nevada is men go out and live with her,
[1:44:54] marry a girl, take her for a wife, live
[1:44:56] with her for a few days. You don't like
[1:44:59] her, kick her out.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Is that what you want to teach your
[1:45:05] kids?
[1:45:08] kick her off without the courts. Ungodly
[1:45:11] people, give them a divorce and a
[1:45:13] license to marrying another. God says
[1:45:15] that's wrong. That's right.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Our civilization is crumbling.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; We see that it's a sign, a post that
[1:45:24] we're at the end time.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Bren is saying, "Now, watch
[1:45:27] this. All of this,
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; the marrying and giving a marriage and
[1:45:31] the divorce and living together, it's a
[1:45:33] sign. It's a junction
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; in time.
[1:45:37] And he says, "We've come to that
[1:45:38] junction. I'm here declaring to you it's
[1:45:41] a sign we're here."
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Watch." He says, "God does
[1:45:46] supernatural things at junctions."
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; This is the age of people's rights. Why?
[1:45:53] It's loud.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; My body, my right.
[1:45:58] I can do what I want.
[1:46:02] From abortionists to pornographers,
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; from homosexuals to drug users and
[1:46:08] pedophiles,
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; they all say, "I have the right to do
[1:46:13] what I want."
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Because this is the age of people's
[1:46:18] rights.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; The church is only as strong as the home
[1:46:22] unit.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; The chain is only as strong as its
[1:46:27] weakest link.
[1:46:31] That's why God give us strong families,
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; husbands in your position, wives in your
[1:46:39] position. Because when the husband's in
[1:46:41] position, the wife's in position,
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; the children will be in position,
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; and God's pleased,
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; does that mean you're with without
[1:46:50] trouble?
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Hey, wake up, man.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; You're in warfare.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:57] You can do all of the above things that
[1:47:00] are right and correct
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; and still have all kinds of hell
[1:47:04] breaking loose all around you.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; It's a battle.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; It is.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; And if you're not in a battle right now,
[1:47:13] you're coming out of one.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; But guess what? There's another one
[1:47:18] around the corner.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; So, we need to be spiritually aware. So,
[1:47:23] with the opening of the seals and praise
[1:47:24] God with with all of this and we take
[1:47:27] the book and we eat it and hallelujah
[1:47:30] and praise God and we're the final
[1:47:32] voice.
[1:47:33] Yes. Hallelujah. Praise God. I agree.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; But you better prepare for war.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the devil hates this me.
[1:47:43] That's why
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; he hates this message. Denominations
[1:47:49] hate the revealing of the word.
[1:47:52] Why? It exposes.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; It exposes.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Look at this in the book of Joshua
[1:48:04] chapter 7. Joshua 7:es 10-15. The Lord
[1:48:08] said unto Joshua, get thee up. Wherefore
[1:48:10] liest thou upon thy face?
[1:48:14] Israel hath sinned,
[1:48:16] and they have also transgressed my
[1:48:18] covenant, which I commanded them. In
[1:48:20] other words, I give them rules and
[1:48:22] things that they should go by, but
[1:48:23] they've transgressed. For they have even
[1:48:26] taken of the oursed thing
[1:48:30] and have also stolen
[1:48:34] and disassembled also, and they have put
[1:48:37] it even among their own stuff. What I do
[1:48:40] in my home is my business.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Who am I? my brother's keeper.
[1:48:52] What I do in my home, it's my business.
[1:48:57] I one time went to a deacon
[1:49:04] and I went to him because you know what?
[1:49:06] His kids weren't doing right.
[1:49:09] You know what he told me? It's none of
[1:49:11] your business.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. None none of your business.
[1:49:18] you stay away from my kids.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Oh, God,
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; how can a man be a deacon?"
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Do you know he's supposed to rule his
[1:49:32] house? Well,
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; because if he doesn't know how to rule
[1:49:37] his house, well,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; how can he rule the house of God?
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; This is the word.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; So, I thought, "Oh, oh my." Here's a
[1:49:48] deacon in a position that's so supposed
[1:49:50] to help watch over the church of God.
[1:49:53] And he does it in his own family. He
[1:49:55] says, "It's my uh uh what I do with my
[1:49:58] family, what my kids do, it's none of
[1:50:00] your business."
[1:50:06] He was in this church.
[1:50:08] He was in one of my deacons.
[1:50:11] And I thought, "Oh my,
[1:50:14] I'm going to have to take him down.
[1:50:17] Then he told me I'm moving.
[1:50:20] I thought save me the trouble.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Don't think it don't happen among all
[1:50:30] churches.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Every church, huh? Unless you're
[1:50:35] denominational and then you just make
[1:50:36] everybody feel good. We're all going
[1:50:38] when we all get to heaven.
[1:50:42] What a day of rejoicing that will be.
[1:50:46] [Music]
[1:50:49] It doesn't matter the way I live.
[1:50:54] It doesn't matter
[1:50:56] what I do.
[1:51:00] Keep your mouth off me and my family.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, excuse me.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; It's not Hey, saints of God,
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; pray for your pastor.
[1:51:15] Yes,
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; pray for any man of God. You know why,
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; sir?
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; he's got to tell you truth,
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; I've got to apply the word with my own
[1:51:28] family.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Even when it hurts.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham did it with Billy Paul.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; You know why Brother Brennham kicked
[1:51:42] Billy Paul out of the house?
[1:51:45] You know, Billy didn't know that his
[1:51:47] daddy was home. The car was gone or it
[1:51:49] was parked out back or something. So
[1:51:52] anyway, Ma told him, "Billy, you got to
[1:51:54] go in there. You got to do this. You
[1:51:55] ain't my mama.
[1:51:57] You can't tell me what to do."
[1:52:02] Brother Bram, come out of the back room.
[1:52:03] Hey, hey, hey, Billy. Come here.
[1:52:06] Come here, Billy. That's my wife. Any
[1:52:10] man that doesn't stand for his wife
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; when the kids back talk her,
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; you know what you're doing?
[1:52:19] You're teaching your children
[1:52:21] disobedience.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "Billy, you'll not talk to my
[1:52:26] wife that way.
[1:52:29] Kicked him out of the house."
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:37] kicked him out of the house. They went
[1:52:38] and lived with Brother Bran's brother
[1:52:40] and his family. And that was a rough
[1:52:42] family,
[1:52:45] drink, smoke, cussing. The Brandham
[1:52:47] family was not brother Brand said, "Hey,
[1:52:49] all of my family, they they're rough.
[1:52:52] They they were bad people." You remember
[1:52:55] the time that Rebecca and George went
[1:52:57] back to Jeffersonville because we're
[1:52:59] going to find in our ancestral heritage
[1:53:02] somebody in the back ancestral heritage
[1:53:05] somewhere. We're going to take the line.
[1:53:07] And my great great uncle, my great
[1:53:08] greatgrandfather, somebody going to be
[1:53:11] good somewhere. Said the more we dug the
[1:53:13] wor.
[1:53:18] Thank God that God doesn't call us by
[1:53:21] physical lineage.
[1:53:25] Amen.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; An illegitimate child shall not enter
[1:53:28] the congregation
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; 10 generations
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; for 10 generations. Brother Bren said
[1:53:32] over 400 years. I want to ask every one
[1:53:35] of you that have a halo on and you say,
[1:53:38] "Well, there's nothing in my life." Can
[1:53:40] you trace your family lineage back 10
[1:53:43] generations
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; that your great great great great great
[1:53:47] father he put away his wife without the
[1:53:50] proper cause, married another woman, had
[1:53:52] children by him and like this and here
[1:53:54] come you in the 21st century.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:02] Let me tell we're all
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; You guys remember brother Ed Dalton?
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; His wife, Sister Bessie, was
[1:54:12] illegitimate.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, it plagued her.
[1:54:21] She wrote Brother Renham a letter. I've
[1:54:23] got a copy of the letter. Brother Ed,
[1:54:25] let me photograph the original letter.
[1:54:30] He said, she said, "Brother Brennham,
[1:54:34] I'm an illegitimate child. I've read in
[1:54:36] the scriptures. I'm paraphrasing right
[1:54:39] now." I kept it on the back bulletin
[1:54:41] board for years so you all could read it
[1:54:45] and said, "I I just need to know because
[1:54:49] you remember in questions and answers,
[1:54:50] Brother Brennan, will an illegitimate
[1:54:52] child go in the rapture?"
[1:54:57] He said, "Well, I cannot believe that an
[1:55:01] illegitimate child
[1:55:04] would be in the perfect will of God and
[1:55:06] that it would go in the rapture." How
[1:55:08] many knows he says this in conduct order
[1:55:10] and doctrine
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; questions and answers.
[1:55:14] So now if you take the legalistic side
[1:55:16] about it
[1:55:19] up to 10 generations,
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; 400 plus years.
[1:55:24] Brother Brennham, I'm illegitimate.
[1:55:28] I want to know, is there any hope?
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Dear Sister Bessie, I'm sitting here in
[1:55:34] the room with brother Leo Mercer and
[1:55:38] he's writing this down. And he said
[1:55:39] actually all of us are illegitimate born
[1:55:43] under our our prostitute parent
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Eve.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; And he said the new birth corrects it
[1:55:52] all.
[1:55:55] [Applause]
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Here was the law. Here was grace coming
[1:56:03] right back together. Otherwise all of us
[1:56:06] would say there's no hope.
[1:56:10] But I am here to tell you because of the
[1:56:13] blood,
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; because of God's covenant,
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter all of your doubts and
[1:56:20] fears and failures and complexes and
[1:56:23] this and that
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; and this broken and that broken and this
[1:56:27] divorce and all of that. Amen.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Because of grace,
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; I ain't putting anybody in out.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; We can take it and try to make it all
[1:56:41] black and white. Let me tell you,
[1:56:43] nothing is black and white.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; No sin be forgiven you,
[1:56:52] especially blasphemy.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; That's the only one not forgiven. Paul
[1:56:57] said, "I'm a blasphemer." Was
[1:57:01] he forgiven?
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; It ain't about the person.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; And it ain't about their works.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; It's about the promise.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; God watching over his seed.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; It's all him. It's not you. It ain't how
[1:57:24] good you've done. It ain't all the
[1:57:26] things that you've done right. Nor is it
[1:57:29] all the things you did wrong that's
[1:57:30] going to condemn you. For by grace are
[1:57:33] you saved through faith.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; And that is not a work of man. It is by
[1:57:39] a gift of God, lest any man boast.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; I just showed you in Joshua 7, go to
[1:57:55] verse 13. up. Sanctify the people and
[1:57:58] say, "Sanctify yourselves against
[1:58:00] tomorrow.
[1:58:01] For thus say the Lord God of Israel,
[1:58:04] there's an thing in the midst of thee,
[1:58:06] oh Israel, thou cannot stand before
[1:58:08] thine enemies until you take away the
[1:58:11] thing from among you."
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; How many you of you remember that Joshua
[1:58:18] said, "Okay." Because the angel said,
[1:58:20] "Get up your face. Why are you crying?
[1:58:21] Why cry? Speak. Sin." Right?
[1:58:25] So they go along. What was the name of
[1:58:27] the man who came before Joshua?
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Help me out.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Achen.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Achen.
[1:58:37] How many achens do we have within the
[1:58:39] message? Well, what I do in my tent,
[1:58:43] I can take up the thing. I'll take
[1:58:45] Babylonian garments from mystery
[1:58:48] Babylon. I'll let my daughters dress
[1:58:49] like harlots.
[1:58:54] I will eat things sacrificed on the
[1:58:56] idols. I will hide the Babylonian
[1:58:59] wedges of silver and gold in my tent.
[1:59:01] And it it doesn't matter because it's my
[1:59:04] tent. It's my business.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that little little levan
[1:59:10] leavenvens the whole lump?
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Israel suffered because of disobedience.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; That's the truth,
[1:59:21] Lord.
[1:59:22] Can you imagine that when he came before
[1:59:25] and Joshua said, "Why have you done
[1:59:28] this?"
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Why have you troubled Israel? I
[1:59:34] didn't think it was that big a thing. He
[1:59:37] said, "We're losing men." God said, "You
[1:59:39] you'll win every battle." And now great
[1:59:42] men, mighty men of valor are being
[1:59:46] killed.
[1:59:48] And God said, "They're sinning again."
[1:59:50] Achen, why have you done that?
[1:59:53] So he showed him. He ex He said, "Well,
[1:59:56] yeah, yeah. I went ahead. I brought back
[1:59:58] the television. I brought back all of
[2:00:00] the things the things I was supposed to
[2:00:02] kick out. I brought back all of this
[2:00:04] stuff,
[2:00:06] but it's in my tent.
[2:00:08] It's okay. I'm not
[2:00:11] I wasn't trying to get everybody over to
[2:00:13] my tent, but what we did in my family."
[2:00:16] So Achen affected his family. So they
[2:00:19] said, "Achen, bring your wife.
[2:00:22] Bring your children."
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine?
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; So here comes Achin with his wife and
[2:00:29] the kids hand in hand walking up there.
[2:00:33] Um,
[2:00:36] why are we here before everybody?
[2:00:39] Daddy.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Daddy.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; I thought you said it was okay.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Daddy. Why didn't you tell us,
[2:00:51] Daddy? Why is everybody so mad?
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Daddy, they're picking up rocks.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; What are they going to do, Daddy?
[2:01:01] Pretty somber.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; You.
[2:01:07] Daddy,
[2:01:10] why didn't you tell me? Daddies, I'm
[2:01:13] gonna here's a solemn warning to every
[2:01:15] one of you daddies.
[2:01:17] Because you let down the standard in
[2:01:19] your home, it will affect your wife and
[2:01:22] your children and they may miss it all
[2:01:24] because of you letting down the
[2:01:26] standard.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. God, help us.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't ever let some kind of thing
[2:01:35] come in here to defile us. He said,
[2:01:37] "You've taken of the oursed thing."
[2:01:44] Second Corinthians 10:es 3-5.
[2:01:48] Though we walk in the flesh, we do not
[2:01:50] war after the flesh.
[2:01:54] For the weapons of our warfare
[2:01:57] are not carnal,
[2:02:00] but mighty
[2:02:02] through God to the pulling down of
[2:02:04] strongholds.
[2:02:06] What are strongholds? When you have
[2:02:08] opened a door to a spirit and you
[2:02:12] thought it was okay,
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; whether it's rock music, whether it's
[2:02:17] the wrong kind of movies, whether it is
[2:02:20] laying down or uh
[2:02:24] lowering the standard of any part of
[2:02:27] God's word,
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; you have compromised.
[2:02:33] And when you have compromised
[2:02:35] and you've allowed that to come in
[2:02:38] and it starts a stronghold.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Now what happens when you get a
[2:02:44] stronghold?
[2:02:46] Listen to me saints.
[2:02:48] You open a doorway that God told you to
[2:02:51] keep shut and a spirit. Brother Brim
[2:02:54] said as an example, you go and play with
[2:02:55] a Ouija board.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; You guys know what a Ouija board is?
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; It's okay. Come on. I've heard of kids
[2:03:04] within the message playing with Ouija
[2:03:05] boards.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; It's witchcraft.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Take a spirit.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; He said you listen to the wrong kind of
[2:03:13] music, you take a spirit. You put on the
[2:03:16] wrong kind of clothes, you take a
[2:03:17] spirit.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; You might have a long dress, but it's a
[2:03:22] skin down wiener. You took a spirit.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:03:32] Because if we lower the standard, guess
[2:03:34] what? Everybody below that standard now
[2:03:37] gets compromised.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; We are either influenced from above or
[2:03:47] from below.
[2:03:50] Watch this. 1954, Brother Brennan
[2:03:52] preaches the most interesting sermon
[2:03:54] called the invasion of the USA.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I was born in the USA.
[2:04:02] I was born in the USA.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right on, brother.
[2:04:11] You got your rights, don't you?
[2:04:15] Was born in the USA.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Watch the invasion of the USA.
[2:04:22] Hallelujah. I say that because I feel
[2:04:24] the Holy Spirit is here.
[2:04:26] The invasion is on.
[2:04:29] Just sweeping from house to house,
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; from place to place, from church to
[2:04:35] church,
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; and from man to man.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the devil.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; The invasion's on.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; I ain't saying nothing about this
[2:04:46] individual or that individual. See, I'm
[2:04:48] saying it's unclean spirits that are
[2:04:51] possessing the people.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:55] Do you see? He can tell by what they're
[2:04:58] manifesting. It's a spirit.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Okay. Dividing between spirit and soul.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; The invasion of the United States to
[2:05:15] overthrow the church. The church is
[2:05:18] overthrowed
[2:05:19] by the devil.
[2:05:23] You see, whichever you yield your spirit
[2:05:27] to, you become the servant thereof.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just yielding myself a little
[2:05:34] bit to this and a little bit of the
[2:05:36] world and a little bit of this and that.
[2:05:37] Next thing you know, don't you realize,
[2:05:39] be not deceived.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; God is not mocked.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; For whatsoever you sow,
[2:05:48] that shall you reap. If you sow to the
[2:05:52] flesh, you shall of the re the flesh
[2:05:54] what?
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Reap corruption.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Well, how'd this happen? I don't
[2:05:59] understand, brother. Wh Why is my family
[2:06:02] Why Why is this happening?
[2:06:05] You let down the bars.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Why cry?
[2:06:11] You know what you're doing?
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Because you either sow to righteousness
[2:06:16] or you sow to unrighteousness.
[2:06:23] What's happening right now among the
[2:06:25] message
[2:06:27] is there is a purging from unbelief
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; because the wheat
[2:06:33] is going to be separated from the shuck
[2:06:35] because the shuck is not heir
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; with the wheat.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that this is a judgment?
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; The house of God is a house of judgment.
[2:06:48] And if the righteous scarcely be saved,
[2:06:50] what about the sinner and the ungodly?
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; If the token is not applied to our lives
[2:06:59] and to our homes,
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; we're deceiving ourselves.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; What does it mean to apply the token?
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Do we just confess it while we've got
[2:07:08] the token and then we let every all of
[2:07:10] the world come in and our kids can do
[2:07:12] anything in their room? And as long as
[2:07:13] they close the door and what they do in
[2:07:15] their room, it's Oh, hey, what? Wait a
[2:07:17] second, Joshua. I thought about me and
[2:07:19] my
[2:07:41] and if you disagree with it and you get
[2:07:43] old enough,
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; huh? Right?
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; There's so many of you young kids. Oh, I
[2:07:51] can't wait till I grow up. Can't wait to
[2:07:53] get out of the house. I don't have to go
[2:07:55] to school. I can get a car. I can go to
[2:07:57] work and I can do my own thing. Uh-huh.
[2:08:02] Then you come courting some young girl
[2:08:04] in the church.
[2:08:08] They come to me, "Brother Ron, what do
[2:08:10] you think?" Ain't no way. Don't even
[2:08:12] consider that guy.
[2:08:15] I showed you that clip years ago and I
[2:08:17] don't mean to make a make a a a joke.
[2:08:19] The young man came to his pastor. He
[2:08:21] said, "Pastor," he said, 'You know, he
[2:08:23] said, 'Really, I I want you to pray for
[2:08:24] me. I want to I I want to get married. I
[2:08:27] want to have a family. I want to have
[2:08:29] kids. And so the pastor said, "Oh, you
[2:08:30] do? I do. Do you have a job?" "No, no.
[2:08:32] Well, you know, I the the boss, he and I
[2:08:35] didn't get along." And you know, we So,
[2:08:37] I quit and this and that. And he said,
[2:08:38] "Well, do you have a place to take her?"
[2:08:40] "Well, no. you know, I'm still at home
[2:08:42] and uh you know, on and on. And he asked
[2:08:45] a few more questions. He said, "But will
[2:08:47] you pray for me?" He said, "Yeah, yeah."
[2:08:49] He says, "Heavenly Father, pray that you
[2:08:53] keep this man as far away from our
[2:08:56] girls."
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Come on, fathers.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; I'll pray for you. All right.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Y
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Watch this
[2:09:12] in the sermon that brother Rem preaches
[2:09:14] out.
[2:09:18] But this is good.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Because you know what? This is where we
[2:09:22] live.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; This is where we live.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says in the sermon, the
[2:09:30] token, believe what? Believe the Lord
[2:09:32] Jesus Christ for your house. Apply the
[2:09:34] token to your house. Then what do you do
[2:09:36] when you apply it to your house? Move
[2:09:40] all the trash out.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; Get all the short skirts,
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[2:09:54] Brother Brandon,
[2:09:56] young girls, mothers,
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; mama, if you're wearing a a skirt that
[2:10:02] is right at knee length and you play
[2:10:06] tugof-war when you sit down,
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; what's your daughter going to be like?
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; You got it.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; The short skirts
[2:10:19] I would like to see. You know, I'm I'm
[2:10:21] not a legalist, but I'd love to see the
[2:10:24] dresses among our sisters
[2:10:28] getting longer, not shorter.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Now, the dress don't make you holy,
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; but the Holy Ghost inside of you will
[2:10:37] tell you that's too short.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; How tight is too tight? How short is too
[2:10:46] short?
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Do you see? Huh? Is it okay if the dress
[2:10:54] is right at the knee?
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Is it okay? Then when I sit down,
[2:11:04] doesn't that make you uncomfortable?
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; What if it's too tight? And they walk
[2:11:10] like this
[2:11:12] and then they come to stairs.
[2:11:18] God forbid there be a fire.
[2:11:22] I'm not trying to be a
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you another question.
[2:11:33] If your dress is too short and you wear
[2:11:35] leggings, is that permissible?
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:11:43] leggings are really becoming very
[2:11:44] popular
[2:11:46] because if your girls are going to play
[2:11:48] sports, well then ah I can't run in a
[2:11:51] long skirt, so I got I'll put a shorter
[2:11:53] skirt on and I'll put leggings on.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Hey, it's getting real silent in here.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:06] You ever seen what holiness women did
[2:12:09] years ago when they went snowk skiing?
[2:12:11] Do you know that they even climbed
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; mountain peaks and everything and they
[2:12:16] wore long dresses?
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; They skied in long dresses. In fact,
[2:12:21] there was one time
[2:12:24] that my daughter and a bunch of the
[2:12:26] sisters went skiing. I believe it was up
[2:12:29] in in Canada with some of the Canadian
[2:12:32] sisters up there and they had their long
[2:12:34] dresses and they were they were skiing
[2:12:37] and hey, nothing wrong with skiing. And
[2:12:41] guess what? Some guys skied up to him
[2:12:43] and said, "That is so cool.
[2:12:48] I love it."
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, don't be ashamed of
[2:12:54] what you believe.
[2:12:56] Don't be don't dare to let me say dare
[2:12:59] to be different.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; Don't see how close to the edge you can
[2:13:06] come.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Any of you see people that they they
[2:13:10] come up to a cliff and
[2:13:13] [Music]
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Huh? I I I don't even like to see kids
[2:13:19] up getting close to the edge. You know,
[2:13:21] I'm one of these guys. As I get on my
[2:13:23] belly,
[2:13:24] I call up.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, how close to the edge
[2:13:32] do you want to get?
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Do you want to be a borderline believer?
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; All the way.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going all the way.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; All the way.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; I'm going all the way.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going all the way with my Lord.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; How many of you say, "I'm going all the
[2:14:00] way."
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not attacking people.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not going after people.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; It's spirits.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Because once we let down the bars,
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; how did the camel get in the tent? One
[2:14:18] foot at a time.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; Huh? Oh, please, mister. Please. Oh,
[2:14:23] just let me get my head inside the tent.
[2:14:25] It's a It's a sandstorm outside. Oh,
[2:14:28] please just say head in. And it's okay
[2:14:30] if just one leg. And then and then
[2:14:32] pretty soon, yeah, the the second leg
[2:14:34] and everything. And guess what?
[2:14:37] Now all of a sudden, he's in the tent.
[2:14:38] How do you get in?
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; One little piece at a time.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:48] We're talking about spiritual warfare.
[2:14:50] We're talking about the opening of the
[2:14:52] seals
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; was an exposing of Satan coming into the
[2:14:56] church trying to make it lukewarm,
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; formal, and powerless.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; Sister Vicki, God bless you. It's good
[2:15:07] to see you.
[2:15:12] Come
[2:15:17] on.
[2:15:22] I've been believing this message
[2:15:25] since I was 18.
[2:15:28] I've been a fanatic for it. Have I made
[2:15:31] my mistakes? Yes, absolutely.
[2:15:35] But I want to go all the way.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; I have determined in my heart
[2:15:42] If none don't go,
[2:15:45] it won't hinder me.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; If none don't go,
[2:15:52] it won't hinder me.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; If none don't go,
[2:15:58] it won't hinder me. Why? I'm going all
[2:16:00] the way.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; I have purposed in my heart.
[2:16:06] I would rather quit and step down from
[2:16:09] the ministry than to compromise with
[2:16:12] what I believe.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; I really would.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; And if you want somebody that
[2:16:21] is a socializer,
[2:16:23] a compromiser or something,
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; it ain't me. That's right.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brennham said, he says, "And
[2:16:32] now watch,
[2:16:34] he says, depending on what kind what
[2:16:37] kind of filter you have,
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; you'll find a church that will satisfy
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; that worldly man's taste.
[2:16:48] But if you have a Holy Ghost filter,
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; the last quote, musicians, if you've
[2:16:58] come, God bless you. I love you guys.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; I do. Love's corrective. Is it right,
[2:17:06] brother D?
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; David, you know what I love about you?
[2:17:20] You don't quit.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; You don't quit.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; Have you fallen?
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; We've had our talks.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; But you keep coming.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; You keep sitting on the front row.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Why don't you sit on the back row?
[2:17:41] You're so tall anyway people can't see
[2:17:43] around you.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; David, I love you.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; For the fact that you keep coming
[2:17:51] because I've not been easy on you and
[2:17:52] you know that
[2:17:55] some of the rest of you, you know that.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Had to come to you. Had to come to you
[2:18:00] about your kids.
[2:18:04] [Music]
[2:18:08] You got to be tough to keep coming when
[2:18:12] you get scolded and you have a little
[2:18:13] bit of corrective, right?
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; I just trust that I I didn't do it in a
[2:18:21] wrong spirit.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:18:25] I trust that my spirit is Christlike.
[2:18:29] Sandy and I were listening to the tape
[2:18:31] last night. Do you remember the name of
[2:18:32] the tape of Sandy?
[2:18:34] God of this evil age. And my brother
[2:18:40] Brennan preached so hard. I thought, "Oh
[2:18:44] my, the God of this evil age."
[2:18:49] Well, there's only one thing that
[2:18:50] exposes the God of this evil age, and
[2:18:53] that's the word of God for this hour.
[2:18:58] [Music]
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; I trust more and more of you get into
[2:19:02] it. Find out what he said
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; because the sword when it's unshathed
[2:19:08] when Sabino Canyon happened, guess what?
[2:19:11] It declared war.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; And that's why the doors were closing
[2:19:15] everywhere. Denominations closed the
[2:19:17] door. No longer. I sit in down in
[2:19:20] Tucson. No one even invites me.
[2:19:24] [Music]
[2:19:26] No wonder he he was
[2:19:30] [Music]
[2:19:31] dejected.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; What good is it done? All of this.
[2:19:39] Then God said, "You want to see beyond
[2:19:40] the curtain of time?
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; You want to see?" Yeah, I would. I I
[2:19:46] wonder how many are going to be there
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; because I saw so very few actually
[2:19:51] receiving the word for this hour. I saw
[2:19:53] very few. There weren't no evening light
[2:19:55] tabernacles and and end time gospel
[2:19:58] evangelism and all the there no none.
[2:20:01] There was a a little bit here and a
[2:20:03] little bit in a little group. Maybe a
[2:20:05] couple people listening to tapes here
[2:20:06] and there.
[2:20:09] So they said, "You want to see?" Yeah,
[2:20:11] I'd like to.
[2:20:13] Out of body experience goes beyond the
[2:20:16] curtain of time.
[2:20:20] He looks and he sees thousands and
[2:20:22] thousands.
[2:20:25] He said, "Are these all brandoms?"
[2:20:30] He said, "No, no, these are your
[2:20:33] converts."
[2:20:36] Listen, Malachi 4 had already gone off
[2:20:40] the scene. Revelations 10:7 had already
[2:20:44] died
[2:20:46] and was buried.
[2:20:49] I didn't come into the message till
[2:20:51] 1971.
[2:20:55] [Music]
[2:21:03] But God, it it says in the days of the
[2:21:07] voice, somebody say voice.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; Voice.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; The days of the voice, not of his life.
[2:21:12] He said even after I'm gone, you watch
[2:21:14] these tapes will go on being played.
[2:21:17] Amen.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Thank God that we got these tapes. Thank
[2:21:20] God.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; Huh? God, what a mess we would be in if
[2:21:23] we didn't have the tapes to go back and
[2:21:25] listen to.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; There'd be so much confusion. This man
[2:21:29] this and that and over here and what do
[2:21:30] you believe and thank God for the tapes.
[2:21:33] That's why I encourage every one of you.
[2:21:35] You listen to them tapes.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; You go home, you listen to them with
[2:21:40] your children. You give them seals books
[2:21:42] and church age books and let them read
[2:21:44] for themselves. get into it.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; You apply the token.
[2:21:53] You teach them war.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; You teach them.
[2:21:58] [Music]
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; He says because you know what they're
[2:22:03] fight.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; He says in the sermon, the contest,
[2:22:07] he said every one of you going to fight
[2:22:09] him. Every one of you. The contest is
[2:22:11] on. Depends on how you learn to fight.
[2:22:15] Any of you
[2:22:18] seen somebody who don't know how to
[2:22:19] fight?
[2:22:26] Stop it.
[2:22:29] You want somebody know how to fight. All
[2:22:31] of a sudden, you come up and they're
[2:22:32] they're challenge you. Hey. Hey.
[2:22:36] You feeling froggy?
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; And then you watch the stance.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:22:44] cuz they're preparing.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:22:51] You may think you're big bad. Brother
[2:22:54] Brennham went in and
[2:22:57] he want I want to be big bad Bill. I
[2:23:00] want to be a a boxer and his trainer.
[2:23:04] Huh? What was the name of his trainer?
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Six.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; Six seconds. because he knows most of
[2:23:10] the time if he ever got to boxing you
[2:23:12] around, you lasted about six seconds and
[2:23:14] you was knocked out.
[2:23:17] He says, "Why in the world when I get in
[2:23:20] the ring with you try to knock my head
[2:23:23] off?"
[2:23:25] He said, "Cuz Bill, when you get in that
[2:23:27] ring,"
[2:23:29] he said, "That's what they're gonna do
[2:23:30] to you."
[2:23:32] They asked Mike Tyson, "Well, you have a
[2:23:34] plan about how you're gonna fight that
[2:23:36] guy." He said, "Yeah, the plan goes out
[2:23:38] the window the moment the first time
[2:23:40] your bell gets rung.
[2:23:42] Then it's against the ropes and it's
[2:23:44] okay." Huh?
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; I want to teach you guys war.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; I do. I want to take our young girls or
[2:23:59] our young men, our young couples.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; I want to teach you war because you know
[2:24:05] what? You're going to face the enemy.
[2:24:08] You're going to see the enemy and you're
[2:24:10] going to be in the contest.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; I don't want any of you failures. I
[2:24:17] don't want to lose any of you.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; I want to take as many as you.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Of you I can take with me.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; Some of you going to scream and holler
[2:24:27] and fight and that's okay.
[2:24:30] I'm going to do everything I can.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:34] try to take you with me.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; Keep me true,
[2:24:46] Lord
[2:24:47] Jesus.
[2:24:49] Keep me true.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; Keep me true,
[2:24:58] Lord
[2:25:00] Jesus.
[2:25:02] keep me to truth.
[2:25:08] There's a race that I must run.
[2:25:15] There are victories
[2:25:18] to be
[2:25:21] gi.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Once again,
