come and minister to their hearts we commit our time into your hands we love you and we thank you be with us I pray in Jesus name amen amen and amen if you have your Bibles turn to Psalms 145 Psalms 14 5 and it says I will exalt thee my god oh King I Will Bless thy name Forever and Ever every day will I bless thee and I will praise thy name forever and ever great is the Lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable yes sir one generation shall praise thy Works to another and shall declare thy Mighty acts I will speak of the Glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous Works yes Amen in verse 8 the Lord is gracious and full of compassion can you say amen amen slow to anger and of a great Mercy the Lord is good to all and his Tender Mercies Are Over All all his works all thy Works shall praise thee Oh Lord and thy Saints shall bless thee th shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the Glorious Majesty of his kingdom thy kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and thy Dominion endureth throughout all generations if you can turn to Daniel 4 Daniel 4 and if my voice it sounds a little funny they're trying to tweak the the microphon so they're going to try to get that worked out Daniel 4:3 and it says how great is are his signs and how Mighty are his wonders his kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and his Dominion is from generation to generation and one more verse in Deuteronomy 7 Deuteronomy 7 and verse 6 and he's talking to the children of Israel here and he says for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God and the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people for ye were fewer of all people but because the Lord loved you because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers and ha the Lord brought you out of this Mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of the bondman and from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt know the there the that the Lord thy God he is God God the faithful God which keepeth the Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations you see why are you a special people it's not because you know there's other churches that gather on a Wednesday night there's other people that Gather in a building but why are you a special people unto him because he chose you it's has nothing to do with your choosing you didn't choose him but God chose you right and he's keeping an oath that he has with your father you can be seated this evening he is a faithful God and one that keeps his Covenant and his Mercy forever and tonight if we can take a title of God in his Generations God in his generations and I I don't want to talk about the the generations or the age the age as a whole but I want to go down the the way of we know that we are the final generation we are the final voice Amen to this age but God deals with Generations within a generation amen so you have many generations that have come down through time but as we sit here this evening there's many generations amongst us that I can say as I we sit here that I you know my grandfather is here and then you have my dad and myself and my son so you have four generations within a generation and God deals with all those Generations yes sir and I was reading in the church age and I was just kind of going through and it says in the the the thyrian church age I might go to a handheld I might go to a handheld good I'm going to go with white oh my it's kind kind of bothering me so if that's all right test all right can you hear me all right yeah that feedback was kind of bothering me so all right praise the Lord amen so as I begin to to to just read in the in the in the church ages and I begin to go through and and in in the uh thyrian Church age well it's Revelations 2:9 it says I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last shall be the last to be more than the first and I begin to think that this might be true to every single age that as we go on and time goes on that the last is going to be more and it's going to be greater than the first that thy service and thy love and everything that theyy do thy faith and thy patience will be more than what it started out as why is that because as the word continues as the word goes on it's going to become greater and it's going to become become more clearer to the bride right and so we see that you will have greater love and greater service and greater Faith because the bigger the problem the bigger the problem listen God is going to match that problem the bigger the trial the bigger the blessing the bigger the faith you need the bigger the sickness the greater the sickness the greater that healing is going to be and we understand the age that we're living in and why in this last age the last will be greater why as we get closer to the coming of Lord why will it be greater because it's a restoration age it's a restoring back age it's bringing everything back to the original right for we know that that's why Malachi 4 was sent was to restore the faith would restore us back that restore the fathers to the sons and the sons to the Fathers as we read in Psalms 4 that one generation shall praise thy Works to another and shall deare thy Mighty acts and we read here in the generation the word generation means the succession or series of persons from the same stock a series of persons from the the same stock now if we look at this we know that naturally in our in our human uh makeup we are not made up of the same stock we come from different cultures different backgrounds different ethnicities all these different things and most of us we would never have anything in common most of us wouldn't even Gather in the same place because we wouldn't have that much in common but there's one thing that we have in common is that we have the same same heavenly father that we have the same father that had made us and he has that bloodline that runs within us amen and so if we look naturally we have nothing in common but spiritually we are made up from the same stock we come from the same bloodline and it's a it's a something that people now are looking into their ancestors they're so interested on where they came from you can go and get an ancestor test you can take a DNA test and you can find out different things about your makeup y why is it people want to find out where they come from it's human nature amen you want to know where you came from you want to know what the makeup is why what makes me the way I am why am why am I the way I am right because when you begin to look back you can begin to see see things in the past things in your your relatives sometimes you know you might be like your granddad or your uncle or you might look like your uncle or you might look like your aunt or you might look like this person why because it's back in the ancestors you begin to look farther back because people want to know where they came from because it's the same thing spiritually when you know where you came from you know where you're going you can identify a problem if there is a problem right you see we I begin to as I was just going through the church ages and I begin to think that many times that we are living on blessings and Promises of past Generations living on blessings and Promises of past Generations I'm not talking about Generations we can read in the Bible and you can go through the history of the Bible and you can see from generation to generation you can see that transition but I'm talking within your own family that you're living on a blessing because your granddad belied this message and he took God at his word he began to believe it and serve God and make commitments and do things for God and you're living on that blessing yeah you see men within this building you can look at Elders brother Bobby my granddad for the men of different ones men's of history that have walked in this message for many years and yet they're still waving the banner of Jesus Christ High abut that they're still carrying this message that they're still yeah they may think that they're in retirement and that they they don't have a posted the duty and all these things but yet they're great in the economy of God true that many of them sit there and study in the message and in the message all day long why because they have the time to do it amen maybe we're reaping the benefits of them studying and being constantly in the word true how blessed we should be as a body when we see that yes yeah and how that we can be recipients of those blessings and how important it is for each generation to continue to pass on that inspiration on let us read in Matthew 1 and one I want to read the book of the generations of Jesus Christ and I begin to see something here in Matthew 1:1 the book of the generations of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham and Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac begat Jacob and Jacob begat Judas and his Brethren and Judas begat farz and uh Zara of Tamar and z uh farz begat esam and esam begat arum and solom begat Boaz of Ray Racha or Rahab and Boaz begat OED of Ruth and OED begat Jesse and Jesse begat David and the king and David the king begat Solomon of er that had been the wife of uas a't that something that whenever you read that you see a people one that God would come down through and David here that King David would take one and he begat Solomon through another woman that was the wife of uas people of mistakes people of failure of imperfect people and yet he's doing the same thing today you look at your lineage and where you come from of imperfect people but yet God is bringing through an imperfect people to a perfect promise because as we continue to read here because uh and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who was called Christ so all the generations from Abraham to David are 14 generations and from David unto the carrying away into Babylon our 14 generations and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ Our 14 Generations now the birth of Jesus Christ was on the wise when as his mother Mary was espouse to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privy but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him saying Joseph thou son of David thou son of David and I read did we not just read that Jacob Jacob begat Joseph but yet you see when God makes a calling he's not calling based upon who your father is amen but he's calling upon the Royal lineage do you understand that God is calling him thou son of David it's a Royal bloodline that he's calling him from fear not to take Mary unto thee thy wife for that which is conceived of her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou sh shall call his name Jesus and he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done what was done down through lineage God watched over this seed God watched over a one down through a lineage and he came to a spot to where a man and a woman had to take him at his word that it wasn't birth upon an act it wasn't birthed upon an act let me ask you brother Nick if Bethany came to you you guys are engaged and she and she came to you and she said I am a child of the Holy Ghost that's a tough ask that's a tough ask and us as a congregation how would we take that oh yeah right that's hard to believe listen they're not some great men with some understanding and all they're more moral people just like you and I but yet they had to take God at his word so God did all of this he brought it down to a to to two people that would take him at his word that the woman would say be it unto me according to your word and the man would take that honor knowing that it wasn't his child but would bring Mary into his wife to be his wife now he did all that that it might fulfill that which is spoken by the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emanuel being interpreted god with us so down through time imperfect people to a man and a woman that had to take God at his word yes because God is going to bring his word to pass right listen Joseph had to believe it so much that God called him to be the husband of Mary but he never called him to be the father of Jo uh of Jesus right you understand because he couldn't be his father because he already had a father he was conceived of the Holy Ghost so he called was called to be a father or called to be a husband right but not to be that father listen because brother brandham says that he the Bible had to correct itself in Luke let's read it Luke 2 and 41 now his parents went into Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover and when he was 12 years old they went up into Jerusalem after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days they returned and the Child Jesus jesus carried behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew not of it but they supposedly to have been in the company when a Day's Journey and when they sought him among their kin folk and acquaintances listen you're not going to find him there you're not going to find him amongst that those kin folk or amongst those K those acquaintances why because those aren't his kin folk right those aren't his people right those aren't his people those aren't his kin folk it's just like you and I why do you go to Family reunions and you don't fit in and people don't understand you your co-workers your acquaintances they don't understand why you go to church two days a week they don't understand why you don't cuss they don't understand all these different things why you put an emphasis on church more than things of the world true amen they don't understand it why why don't they understand it listen you they won't find you in those places because that ain't your kin folk you're of a Heavenly Kingdom you're of a Heavenly people Amen in verse 45 and when they found him not they turned back again into Jerusalem in verse 48 to save time and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto to him son why hast thou thus dealt with us and behold thy father and I have sought thee in Sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that the ye has sought me wi ye not that I must be about my father's business and it says and they understood him not the not the sayings that he spake unto them why didn't he understand them why didn't they understand his father was a carpenter he should have been out doing carpenter work and hanging out and being with the kin folk but yet he said I'm not I'm about my father's business I'm about my father's business what are you doing this evening coming to church yes what are you doing on and the world doesn't understand right but you're about your father's business that's why I say I come into the house of God and I say God I want you to teach me your ways teach me your statutes yes Lead Me Oh God in thy ways yes amen show me your path put me into your perfect will because if we're not in his perfect will we're in the permissive will I want to be about my father's business yes listen I understand that we must go about our daily lives and we must provide for our families and you know it's not not just about naturally our family going about our daily lives listen that's your business but there's a time to be about God's business very good right it's okay sometimes that you got to go to work and you got to go to school that's your business that's things that we must take care of in our flesh but then there's a time and a place that you must be about your father's business because there's coming a time and the hour is late that if you don't redeem the time amen if you don't redeem the time that you're in amen you won't know what to do when the father comes you won't know what to do when the father when God ask you have you been about my business what is that I don't know on I've been playing around when I was a child I spake as a child and I did childish things but whenever I became a man I put away those things yeah why because you became about your father's business very good amen MH amen there's a difference between your business and the father's business yeah yes in the Easter seal he says how can I deny the mother that gave birth to me how can I deny the father that is his own blood is in me how can I deny Charles brandham from being my father I could not do it I'm willing to stand his reproach or anything because I am his son yeah isn't that something and we know who his father is he was a junker he was a bootlegger and he said I'm willing to take his reproach why because you can't deny who your father is that's right you only have one mother one father you can't deny who that who birthed you who raised you you can't deny that very father or mother amen because you can't choose who your parents are you can't choose who your family is right you don't get a choice in the age that you grew up in you don't have a choice in that you don't have a choice whether you were raised in in a in a family of three or a family of eight you don't have a choice that's right you don't have a choice whether you were rich or poor right you don't have a choice as a kid amen listen I was blessed as a kid to have good parents good father good mother amen grew up in a small town amen and yet we grew up in a 1500 foot house seven of us five kids five kids shared one bathroom oh my some of you are too spoiled five of us shared one bathroom 15 or 1700 square ft it's tight yeah listen I never had my own bedroom till I was a senior in high school I always shared with my older brother until he moved out and then I got my own room but you see I was blessed because I had a father and a mother and as long as the family was there listen I didn't think any diff anything different that was just the way of life so we don't have a choice in the matters right right we don't have a choice in our natural father amen but let me say this it's what you do with that choosing that God places you in very good it's what you do with that choosing when God places you in a spot in a family in a church it's your choice and what you do with that yeah very good on we look at the the prophet's example he says you know that he was willing to take the reproach of his parents because you cannot deny your father or your mother but then he began to as you go through his ministry and you you see that he caught a revelation because he said these are my parents I cannot deny them but then he also said that I'm not the son of Ella and Charles brandham why because when you catch a revelation yeah in the power to transform he says now there are many things in talking about my natural birth there are many things in my natural birth that I cannot brag on I'll tell you I ain't got nothing to brag on my mother was a sinner to begin with my father was a sinner and they come out of a bunch of Cutthroats and gunfighters and most of them died with their boots on drunks and bootleggers and everything else out of Kentucky my mother a half Indian and I've got nothing to brag on I can't brag on my family tree you know many of us could say the same he says but glory to God there's one thing I can brag on now it's my second birth which comes from Jesus Christ I can brag on that parent that we have yes sir for he is my father he is my savior he is my redeemer I can brag on everything that he's done he has done for me because now I become his son I am no more a son of Charles brand am I a son of Jesus Christ that's right I can brag on my birth now I can't brag on my first birth there's nothing I'm ashamed of that I'm not ashamed of my second birth no no I'm not ashamed of that second birth how did he do it by the washing of the water of the word truly predestinated believer stay with the word they won't pervert it it can't be perverted each one of us can say the same that we might not be able to brag on our natural birth our natural ual father hey every father even me being a young father you make plenty of mistakes and I'm sure I will make more of mistakes and many times the devil wants to beat dads down because you know what you didn't do it good enough your sons begin to struggle and they begin to have a hard time and you should have done this and you should have done that but yet we see here what birth are you looking at what birth are you looking at as I said naturally we come from different raisings different backgrounds and the raising of your father will do two of one thing or one of two things maybe three if he's a good dad it'll inspire you to be the half the man he was and if he's a bad one and he's not the greatest example you will do everything to not be like him amen if your dad never gave you anything he never he he never told you he loved you and all these different things you will tell your kid I love you all the time you'll give them everything but you must be careful you must be careful because if your dad didn't show you that love and then you give your kid everything and you're giving them and giving them and giving them you're going to make him a spoiled brat true yes and so we see that the raising of our fathers then con condition us or make us who we are and the third thing was that if you're not careful you'll become him if it's someone that's having a hard time or he's not the greatest examples you'll use an excuse to become the very man he is y y you'll use them as an excuse amen you might say that my great great grandfather or my grandfather or my father was this way and it's a trait that's been passed down from generation to generation within our family but I say that it's time to break that cycle it's time to break that chain that you're so easily saying that you know what it was my dad or this Dad or my grandfather or this trait hey it's time to get rid of that true amen yes amen your dad might have a tendency of whatever it may be of selfworth or not fitting in or you know a commitment to church whatever it may be but don't let that excuse be your excuse amen yes sir every generation if I could say it this way and you understand that a generation starts with you amen there is Generations before you but then there's also Generations after you exactly that's good brother Brandon would tell a story if I can remember it correctly that he there was a man and he was going it was during the winter time and there was snow on the ground and it was during the holiday season and him and holiday drinks he began to walk down the road and as he was going I believe it was they crossed the park or something like that and his son he noticed he looked back and his son was going back and forth he said Son why you why you going back and forth like that he said Daddy I'm just going in your footsteps Daddy I'm just walking in your footsteps let me ask you what kind of footsteps you leaving behind what kind of footsteps are you leaving behind yes it's a tough question it's a good question to Pricks our hearts huh because we all have a choice Amen to be an example and I know I'm talking to the fathers but it goes for every single one of us tonight whether we be a father a mother a Christian a young person yes sir whatever it may [Music] be listen brother brandham says he says you are today what you are you are today what you are because several years ago you chose what you are now and what you choose now will determine what you will be in 5 years from today 5 years from today you may be a missionary or uh 5 years from today you may be a renowned Christian or 5 years from today you may be in hell because you chose or you made the wrong decision and he uses two examples of being a prostitute but I want to bring it closer to home because sometimes 5 years from today you may be fighting for your kids because you didn't think Wednesday nights were that important important on you may be fighting for your kids because you didn't think youth group was important right you may be having a hard time your family might be falling apart because there was not a priority set on Church yes on listen we all have a choice yeah that's all I'm getting at is that we have a choice from today yeah the history is the history but the future is what you make of it you can't change the past but you can change the future based on the decisions that you make from today he says or you may be a man or a woman that's a credit to any society because you chose your choice for Christ 5 years from today he may be in glory gone in the Rapture because you made the choice today but you got to choose and don't look at what you see choose what you see by faith that's the only thing that will count is what you choose by faith choose by faith sir don't go by feeling don't go by emotion don't go because if you go off of the feeling of it and not by faith most of us we won't feel like going to church on a Wednesday night that's right it true listen I feel it too sometimes work is long days are long the kids are sick some sometimes things just aren't going right but that's the time to get to church that's the time to put the faith into action that I don't feel like going but my faith is telling me because if you allow your intellectual if you allow your intellect and your feelings and everything to control you it'll fool you but that's why he's telling you go off of Faith because it's the faith in you that's calling you you know what I need to go I need to be there I need to take a step of Faith because when you you take a step of Faith that's when God takes a step toward you amen amen not based on feeling or intellect but the choices you make today yes are the results of Tomorrow y you see you are either influencing or being influenced by those around you and I'm not talking about just the young people we can so easily put this about the the crowd of your young people and say that which is very true that who you hang around that's who you become true but let me take it from the youngest to the oldest it's true take it from the youngest to the oldest who are you influencing and how are you influencing what influence do you have on your children what influences are we putting on the Next Generation because I believe sometimes we we get in a place and I've seen it that you you know you've been in the message for so long it could be 25 years plus whatever it is and you begin to serve God and you begin to serve God and you begin to sit back and say you know what I'm just going to let that generation handle it I put in my time be careful be careful don't relax too much we're still in a battle we're still in a fight because there's younger Generations looking up at you that are in your 40s and 50s and seeing what are you doing with this message right is that fire still burning as bright and in more then now as it was then because I love to see it I love to ask questions from Elders I love to see it amen I love to ask him questions because there's a lot of miles under that road there's a lot of history there's a lot of trials that we might not have to go through if you ask him a question very good and you might say well I'm a young couple and I don't have kids and I'm just a young person yet our Bible gives us an example of choices made by our parents and it's reflected into the Next Generation and I was reading it to save time and it's in Hebrews 7 go back and read it Hebrews 7 and I I found this little quote that brother brand says cuz he summarizes it and he talks about it's a great event that was taking place with Abraham that he had paid tithes to MDC and when he when he was returning from the slaughter of the Kings and now he said that Levi was in his loins of Abraham when he met MDC coming from the slaughter of the Kings and he reckoned that Levi paying tithes also when he was in those loins his great great grandfather you can't tell me what you do today is important for future Generations exactly that while he was in the loins that Abraham was paying ties to mzc and while Levi was in the loins of Abraham Generations within Abraham he was paying ties to him go read it in Hebrews 7 and he goes on in this quote and he says and he visits the sins of the people upon their children from generation to generation that won't keep his word that won't keep his word yeah you want to know why you might have troubles or struggles you see ones that fall away from this message is cu they walked away from the word they walked away from the truth am and the sins are now upon their children I begin to think we all know what generational wealth is and I'm not talking financially I'm not talking financially though you know one might build an Enterprise and be able ble to build it up and sell it and he might be able to give generational wealth to his children and then his children and the children after that it's a continual thing but yet what are we doing tonight we're giving Our Generations after us generational wealth spiritually and we know that brother brandham says that salvation isn't just p through by natural birth we know that and that God has no grandchildren God has no grandchildren so we must all be tried and tested and proven as children Sons and Daughters of God and we understand that you can't make your kids seed or give them a revelation we know this that we all must come the same way that every one of us must be chased it must be tried and when these kids become of age and we begin to see them struggle or have a hard time brother brandom says it's not passed down through natural birth but let me ask you which one of you want to throw your kids out there the first the first time they start struggling or having a hard time or they start getting into things that they shouldn't how many want to throw in their towels on their kids because there's prom is in God's word that he says if you train up a child in the in the way of the Lord that's he will not depart from it whenever he is old amen he also says that the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are AAR off even as many as our Lord Our God shall call amen so we have promises within his word that if we raise up a child in the way should go they won't depart from it it's not saying they won't have a hard time that's right listen I'm so thankful that whenever I was having a hard time I had a Godly mother and a Godly father that was at home praying for me amen you know I believe that there's a fine balance sometimes a kid's got to find himself sometimes we can coop up our kids in in a way that they're not allowed to go here and allowed to do this and you can't do this well eventually when they get their freedom they're going to go do it they're going to go do it MH and yet my parents on the football team I'd say Mom I'm going out and hanging out with the boys I'll be back I'm going to go to the gym 8:00 at night I thought it was an excuse good excuse then now I hear kids using it I'm like yeah right liar I've been there I know that excuse and a lot of times as kids you think that it's a good excuse like they'll never know yeah right yeah right but you see that there was a little bit of Grace there and my mom would tell me I'd say all right Mom I'm going out 8:00 I'm going to the gym okay I'm praying for you why you praying for me I'm going to the gym but yet it's something it's a great responsibility that we that we ra raise our kids up and that I'm going to believe the promises that God has said in his word for our kids brother brandham says in things that are to be he says you were all pre-planned by God nothing happens by chance with God he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight did you know that that kind of blows my finite mind sure right that Generations ago God planned it for us to be here tonight he would know that you would choose to serve God he would know the very thoughts that you were thinking he would know everything about you that you would make a commitment to come to church because he placed something inside of you he says now the only way that you can be a son a daughter of God is because you have to be and have that eternal life there's there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life only one form of eternal life and that was God there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the father and before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as the Son of God you are nothing but a manifestation of him tonight that's right living out in this day you are now you are an expression you are expressed after his word has come into you to light up this age you are expressing God's life in you because you are a son and daughter of God therefore you get what I mean you are in you are in you are made you're setting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you're Associated amen isn't that something that your duty is to express God your duty is to express God to this nation and to those around you to everyone that you associate with yes everybody should know that you were a Christian everybody should know that if they had a need that they can call on you yeah I've had several within the last couple of weeks some of my customers I do business with I'm not even really close with but they know that I'm a Christian and they'll call you up and say James I'm having a mental breakdown my business is struggling I'm having a hard time I need you to pray with me I pray with him right over the phone praise God why because they should know that I'm a Christian and that there's a source that they can come to that there's something in my life that they're Desiring even a man down in Tucson and he's an older gentleman been in a denominational Christian if you want to call it but yet he called me the other day he said James you got to say a prayer things are happening I need help why because they know that hey I ain't ashamed of what I believe this is our duty is to express and to be the living Christ of this day your very being should be to live out Christ's life to to everyone around you am you were pre pre-planned by God from Generations back yes sir and yet that second birth is what gives us access to these traits y right forget the natural forget your first birth it's the second birth is what gives you access he says in the resurrection of Lazarus he says look deity I am a part of Charles Brandon because I was born of Charles brandham my Daddy I'm a part of him I've got a forehead like him my hair is like him I'm a small man like him I'm in the nature like him because he's my daddy you see whenever you come from a father you begin to resemble everything that he is people can identify you by your father you ever been walking down a place and somebody says hey are you Michael's boy yeah you look just like him why because you look like him and he says the same thing he says and if you were and if we become in spirit son sons of God deity dwells in the man Hallelujah then you talk about blinded eyes being open they said nothing is impossible to God God said nothing is impossible with you if you'll believe not with God but with you deity and a man the the very God that stood back on there on the mythical platforms of Eternity and roll back rolled the worlds off his hands and created these things to give you the privilege Hallelujah gave you the privilege to be the sons of God listen isn't just a right it's not something that's owed to you you didn't earn it it's nothing we did to earn this amen but it's a privilege to be a Son of God it's a privilege and an honor that you must take with a great responsibility what a privilege we have what a blessed people we are Amen to be sons of God and he says and you are a part of him and God dwells in mankind and man himself in deity Hallelujah there you are he says it might choke you it might choke you but study over that a little while you might be choking a little bit but just keep chewing he says he he is God dwells in man and man becomes a Son of God not in him not himself not him in himself but the Holy Spirit that's in him in God the Creator lives in the creation oh my how I like that then stands with the unwavering faith and ask what you will it'll be done there it is listen the Creator lives in the creation I thought that was so powerful we're not talking about a creation out there though he cre created the worlds though he created everything he created the moon he created the Stars he created the trees to worship Him He created all these things that they might glorify him but yet he lives in the very creation of you he lives in the creation of mankind and yet that's what he expects from you is worship he expects praise he expects those things because it is a privilege to serve God it's Christ in you not after the first birth but the second amen you see and as we look at the generations of Jesus Christ all this was done through Pro that prophecy might be fulfilled that prophecy might be fulfilled and yet God is doing the same thing today he brought it down to a generation or Generations that at the final generation it would be a bride it would be an elect lady that would take him at his word that would say be it unto me according to Thy word not knowing what everything would happen after that but yet you say be it unto me according to your word and you become the Fulfillment of Prophecy for your day listen they were the prophecy in fulfillment for their day that a that a that a virgin would conceive that she would there would be an Immaculate Conception that was prophecy fulfillment for their age but you and I there's another prophecy being fulfilled there's manifestations there's things coming to pass there's a restoration of the word coming into fulfillment what is it it's you you the bride taking this word and saying be it unto me amen it's the impregnating of the word in this day not just conceiving seed you can receive seed through all these Generations but it's going to take a generation like you to say God be it unto me I reaccept AC that and you conceive that seed amen the final generation we should be an inspired generation amen we should be an inspired generation yes sir amen listen as we read the last will be more than the first we're not looking into the glare of another age we can't look back of where we come from from do you understand the glare of another age brother Brandon would explain it is out here in the desert you go out in the desert and you see a mirage way off you see water way out there and it looks real it looks like water off in the distance but when you get there there's nothing there right and as long as you keep looking at the glare of another age you will keep looking and receiving nothing because you're looking get something that isn't there it's not real amen it looks real but it's not real right but yet God has given us a word in this age he's given us a word in this age yes sir it's fresh Mana for our hour amen Revelation is becoming more clearer yes prophecies are coming to pass things that the prophets spoke of in the Bible things that our prophets spoke of things that are to be yeah right this day is this scripture fulfilled yes prophecies coming into manifestation right before our eyes yes it is and if we're not careful we'll miss it we'll begin to let up we begin to think that hey days are God's coming we know he's coming but when is he coming right there's ones traveling on this journey that have been a lot longer than I have but yet they're still faithful they're still believing because listen just as his blood won't lose his power his prophecies they will still come to pass amen no matter how long we go how many ages we keep going no matter how many generations keep coming under us that prophecy will come to fulfillment musicians come you are the generation of God coming into fulfillment for this hour everything God was he poured into Christ the man he was the fullness made flesh in that day everything God was he had the he poured everything into himself into Christ but yet he was still tempted he was still tried yeah he was still proven why because he wanted to come down as a man and feel the very things that you go through he wanted to know the pains that you would go through he wanted to feel those things and he learned obedience by what the things he suffered by the things he suffered but yet it still was the fullness for that day and yet prophecy he was the Fulfillment of Prophecy and everything Christ was he poured into the church yes into the [Music] bride he poured himself out into you and I it's not of our first birth but it is of our second birth listen you can only blame your first birth for so long true yeah but if you say if you mean what you say and you say that I'm a son and daughter of God listen that's no more of an excuse that's no more of an excuse you can't use that no more because now it is your heavenly father that's right and you begin to take on the the traits of that heavenly father and everything Christ was he poured into you and I what is it deity in a man and he gave you and I the privilege amen he gave you and I the privilege to be Sons and Daughters of God Amen thank you Lord you know we went on that trip to Von watatu and we had a layover in Fiji and I didn't know that Fiji was an infu Indian infused Island so the they like Indian Polynesian people and they believe in Buddha and all that stuff and so we begin to tour and we told our taxi driver just take us with the brothers we begin to go and they took us to this Buddhist temple and we begin to walk around and we had to take our shoes off and you begin to walk around and you begin to see all these Idols all these Gods yeah and there was a god of wealth and of God of health and a God of this and a god of that and whatever you needed a God for it was there and you had to offer a sacrifice you had to offer a sacrifice to these idols and as we were there you seen young families come you seen ones that would come and they would begin to offer a sacrifice and it was fruit and it was milk and if you want this kind of blessing you got to offer this or you got to do all these different things and we are sitting there watching them yet as I begin to watch him I begin to think God don't ever let us become a place because you can tell that they're just doing it out of tradition that they're doing it just out of a ritual and it just becomes routine and every morning they get up and they go and they offer incense and they begin to do these different things and you see a man leading his family to offer these sacrifices unto all these different gods and I said God don't ever let us become to where we look like that to where we come to the house of God and it's not out of the love of God and there's no joy in our hearts and all these different things you see God yes amen he wants you to do it out of a loving heart he wants you to serve him with with your whole heart yes raise up a child in the way he shall go teach him how to pray teach him how to love God listen it's not just in our spiritual walk can we be an example to those after us but it's in our daily lives in the way we go to work and how we go to school how we conduct business listen that we have to be an example in every aspect of Our Lives because there's ones that are watching us there's ones even in the world you watch yeah I have customers that I go to and they know I'm a Christian and they'll you know they might say a cuss word or they might cuss a couple of times and they'll say it right away hey I'm sorry I didn't mean to that's respect I give him that but yet you watch you say you're a Christian and you go to these different things and you handle a situation incorrectly watch them drop them I thought you were a Christian I thought you believ this I thought you did this and you look at me like that you said this about this person they're watching right they're watching right ones within our assembly young men they're watching the olders yeah because you know what's worse you know what's the biggest stumbling BL a hypocritical Christian that's right a hypocritical Christian yeah true ah there's some that come to church I don't know why I'm going go ahead you come to church and you can see it on the outside and you serve God and you love God and from the surface man I couldn't tell anything different and you go out into the natural side man it's like two different people ah we all make mistakes I understand we all have faults I I know that but I say God help us because we are inspiring Generations you see it's God within every generation from every generation he keeps going amen and yet it's our job it's our privilege to serve God Amen yes not out of obligation even though he said it's out of Duty that we serve him out of Duty that we're a blessing to those around us yeah let us stand to our [Music] feet let's just say a prayer Heavenly Father Lord Lord how blessed we are Lord to know what we know and to serve a God that we do that we don't have to go to uh Gods of idols and we don't have to go through these traditions and if we want to serve this God or we need a prayer for this or we need a healing or we need direction we got to go to different gods but we have one living and one true God who's the same yesterday
