[45:35] released me uh the other day the
[45:38] pulmonologist from uh the hospital and
[45:42] he talked to me went over all of the
[45:43] different things said you don't need
[45:45] oxygen anymore you're doing good two
[45:47] months from now we'll do another CAT
[45:49] scan we'll look and we'll see and
[45:51] everything but you know look saints of
[45:53] God let's face it you get sick you have
[45:56] to go to the doctor you go to the
[45:57] hospital doctor's doctor that's what
[46:01] they do huh a lot of times they don't
[46:03] have any idea so they they probe around
[46:06] and they try this and that and you
[46:07] become a human guinea pig and if this
[46:09] don't work and if it didn't kill you
[46:11] then we'll try to we'll switch the
[46:13] medicine and and everything cuz they
[46:15] bury their
[46:19] mistakes I'm not trying to be a comedian
[46:22] but really saints of God really you can
[46:24] sit there in the hospital
[46:26] they can give you the antibiotics and
[46:28] everything like that but God is the one
[46:30] that is the Healer I can remember in the
[46:33] hospital I just got so inspired they had
[46:36] some kind of a Contraption it went over
[46:38] my head and it looked like an oxygen
[46:41] mask that the World War I Pilots would
[46:44] wear and stuff like this and this thing
[46:47] it it felt like a regulator from a SCUBA
[46:50] tank that when you took
[46:51] air man it was just forcing this stuff
[46:55] uh and and and my lungs were filling up
[46:57] and everything and and actually was
[46:59] quite comfortable I slept with it all
[47:01] night I yeah it was good so anyway long
[47:04] story short I reached up I just felt an
[47:07] inspiration I put my hand on that I have
[47:09] put my hand on the air hose I said in
[47:12] Jesus
[47:13] name I reached over to the ivy that I
[47:16] got antibiotics all this kind of stuff
[47:18] got needles sticking in me everywhere
[47:21] and I just grabbed him and I said in
[47:22] Jesus name amen May every drip bring
[47:27] healing huh come on brother Brenham said
[47:31] God uses doctors God uses medicine if he
[47:35] doesn't he says then you have to make it
[47:37] of the
[47:39] devil right but really the last court of
[47:43] appeal they can give you everything and
[47:45] you can be looks like you're doing well
[47:47] and you're uh you know you're coming out
[47:50] of it and all of a sudden he takes your
[47:53] number but your number cannot be
[47:56] call unless God allows it he said your
[47:59] days here on Earth no matter how huh so
[48:02] I thank God and I thank God for my
[48:04] health I think hey do not take your
[48:06] health for granted okay and uh so I
[48:10] thank God the Bible says that he that
[48:12] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[48:15] is saying to the church so we thank God
[48:18] I believe that what God is doing right
[48:19] now this bride is
[48:22] maturing she is not a Young Bride
[48:24] anymore she is matured she is taking the
[48:28] message and hearing the voice behind the
[48:33] veil somebody say
[48:36] amen amen that's what's happening the
[48:39] quickening power of Revelation is
[48:41] striking the bride the Bible says in the
[48:45] book of Hebrews
[48:47] 11 and Mary by faith right receive seed
[48:52] to
[48:53] conceive the conception now is taking
[48:55] taking place right now many have heard
[48:58] the
[48:59] message but the wise hear something
[49:02] different remember you have the 10 wise
[49:06] five wise five foolish 10
[49:09] virgins yes so just because you came out
[49:14] and you recognize that God sent a
[49:16] prophet that's good that's wonderful
[49:18] praise God that's a beginning yeah what
[49:21] are you doing with this message amen
[49:23] good question that's it is it
[49:24] manifesting in your life is it changing
[49:27] you because if there is no manifestation
[49:30] if there is no change in the physical
[49:33] you're just
[49:35] listening but when you
[49:37] hear my all of a sudden light strikes
[49:41] that seed praise God and it manifests in
[49:45] your
[49:46] life manifestation is what it's all
[49:49] about and Enoch one day he was not
[49:53] because God took him Amen brother Bram
[49:56] said there he was just
[49:59] walking wasn't doing any
[50:02] Miracles he wasn't in some Big Revival
[50:05] waiting for somebody to get him all
[50:06] pumped up he just had a daily
[50:10] walk and that's what I encourage every
[50:12] one of you that that
[50:14] 2024 let it be a daily walk with God
[50:18] Amen don't you love him this morning and
[50:21] let his Revelation come to you strike
[50:23] your soul amen cause you to be changed
[50:27] amen because if he's not changing
[50:30] you you change the way you're listening
[50:33] Hall
[50:34] amen for Faith cometh by hearing hearing
[50:40] the word of God Amen I'm excited amen I
[50:45] am I've had so many little sermon titles

[53:11] so to let you know I I'm just going to
[53:14] say this that the very first doctor the
[53:18] heart
[53:19] surgeon that when I walked into the
[53:22] room you know and and I asked ask him I
[53:25] said because he had aortic dissection
[53:29] which is one of the
[53:30] worst situations that actually was right
[53:33] there and it started to Slough off and
[53:35] the aorta began to just and they call it
[53:38] if you want to look up this is not a
[53:40] medical
[53:41] terminology but it is also recognized
[53:44] trash
[53:45] foot trash foot look it up what it does
[53:49] is all of this stuff that sloughs off
[53:52] from the inside of the aorta goes
[53:54] through the and it goes to all of the
[53:56] capillaries the smallest tiny little
[53:59] blood carrying things that when you
[54:01] prick your finger and it bleeds here and
[54:04] it goes to the nose it goes to the
[54:06] fingers it goes to the toes and we
[54:09] noticed it Brian and Sarah we s notice
[54:11] the foot started turning a little bit
[54:13] purple his nose look like uh uh it
[54:16] started turning bright red and different
[54:19] things and um the doctor
[54:23] said this man
[54:26] is a
[54:27] miracle and said every
[54:30] day for him is another miracle and I
[54:34] want because he is he's basically
[54:38] defying
[54:41] medical whatever you call it technology
[54:43] whatever because they don't know so I
[54:46] want to
[54:48] give the glory to God that we have a man
[54:52] that is defying making a mystery of of
[54:56] the medical world and everything and the
[54:58] Lord willing I will be taking him at
[55:01] some time with me to go and give
[55:04] testimonies and I think Across America
[55:06] here brother Neil there'll be different
[55:08] ones that's going to invite you to come
[55:10] and say give us your testimony of what
[55:12] you went through what it was like
[55:14] because if you've ever been in a dark
[55:16] spot he went through a very very dark
[55:22] time and some of us go through some time
[55:25] very dark times but guess what he said

[59:37] welcome to the house of the Lord we
[59:39] greet you in the name of Jesus Christ
[59:41] and it's always a privilege to be here
[59:44] and to hear God's word if you have your
[59:47] Bible turn with me to the Book of
[59:50] John and chapter 1 and uh we certainly
[59:54] appreciate appreciate the opportunity
[59:56] that our pastor gives us to minister the
[1:00:05] word John chap 1 and verses
[1:00:08] 1
[1:00:10] through3 in the beginning was the word
[1:00:12] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:00:14] was God the same was in the beginning
[1:00:18] with God and all things were made by him
[1:00:21] and without him was not anything made
[1:00:24] that was made in him was life and the
[1:00:28] life was the light of men and verse
[1:00:31] 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:00:34] among us and we beheld his glory the
[1:00:37] glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:00:40] father full of grace and truth amen you
[1:00:43] may be seated this
[1:00:48] morning I would like to title my sermon
[1:00:51] continuing on with this thought of the
[1:00:53] word and this is part
[1:00:56] three when we think of the word of God
[1:01:00] there's many things that we could say to
[1:01:02] describe the word we realize that the
[1:01:05] word of God is our
[1:01:07] absolute it is the guide of Our Lives it
[1:01:11] is our comforter it's our high tower it
[1:01:15] is the answers to all the questions in
[1:01:18] life cu the Bible says that he has given
[1:01:21] onto us uh all things that pertain to
[1:01:25] godliness and the things of this life
[1:01:28] the word is life to the
[1:01:31] believer without the word we have no
[1:01:34] life and so to us as Believers guess
[1:01:38] what this word of God is life and
[1:01:41] without it we don't have anything
[1:01:43] without the word of God guess what we
[1:01:45] don't know who we are we have no
[1:01:47] identity we have no inheritance we have
[1:01:49] no promises we have
[1:01:52] nothing but in the word we have all all
[1:01:58] things the word of God brings peace in
[1:02:00] the midst of our storms it brings light
[1:02:04] in times of
[1:02:06] Darkness the word of God is truth what
[1:02:10] is truth this is
[1:02:15] truth it provides light therefore it
[1:02:19] gives life the word is our blueprint for
[1:02:23] our life in which we are to uh uh live
[1:02:26] our lives before the people amen
[1:02:29] hallelujah and as Believers we should
[1:02:32] want to govern Our Lives after the word
[1:02:34] of God the word of God is water in a
[1:02:39] thirsty land in other words the word of
[1:02:42] God it satisfies the
[1:02:45] believer whenever the believer is in a
[1:02:48] desert Place guess what the word of God
[1:02:50] does it brings water it brings nutrients
[1:02:53] it brings brings life it brings it it
[1:02:56] quenches Hallelujah the very thirst that
[1:02:59] we
[1:03:02] have amongst many other things we could
[1:03:05] call this word of God but the word of
[1:03:08] God in our Bibles is God
[1:03:11] himself and so we realize that in our
[1:03:14] opening scripture that said that all
[1:03:16] things were made by him somebody say him
[1:03:21] and they were made for him
[1:03:24] so in other words we could say that God
[1:03:28] is a
[1:03:29] man God has the attributes of a man
[1:03:33] within
[1:03:34] himself there's many people today that
[1:03:38] excuse
[1:03:39] me there's many people
[1:03:42] today I don't know if you've seen any of
[1:03:45] the videos or not and they get up and
[1:03:48] they stand before the people and they're
[1:03:52] worshiping God and they and they speak
[1:03:54] to God this great eternal spirit and
[1:03:57] they say and they end it and and and
[1:04:00] they don't want to say him they don't
[1:04:01] want to say in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:04:04] but they say in the name of
[1:04:07] it the great eternal spirit understand
[1:04:12] when you take the name away you take the
[1:04:15] power away because people today are so
[1:04:19] into pronouns and and this and that and
[1:04:22] you don't want to offend anybody but I
[1:04:24] want to say this that God is a
[1:04:29] man and so when God made Adam and Adam
[1:04:32] in the beginning and he said go forth
[1:04:35] and and multiply the Earth we realize
[1:04:37] that he was a spirit man but within that
[1:04:41] Spirit man was also a feminist spirit
[1:04:45] and so when God was speaking to the man
[1:04:47] he was speaking both to the masculine
[1:04:50] and to the feminist and we realize that
[1:04:53] there was a time when the the feminist
[1:04:55] was taken out of the man and now she was
[1:04:58] made manifested before Adam it's the
[1:05:01] exact same thing with God he was trying
[1:05:04] to show us something that within him
[1:05:06] there was a feminist Spirit there was a
[1:05:10] a an attribute that laid within God that
[1:05:13] would be manifested one day that he
[1:05:16] would say that is my bride that is bone
[1:05:19] of my bone and that is Flesh of My Flesh
[1:05:22] and I believe that we as the of Jesus
[1:05:24] Christ are fulfilling the very
[1:05:26] attributes and thoughts of God in this
[1:05:30] [Applause]
[1:05:33] day
[1:05:35] Hallelujah we see that within Christ
[1:05:39] Christianity Today that that they change
[1:05:43] God in order to uh in order to uh
[1:05:48] suffice their thoughts and and and their
[1:05:50] feelings of what they are in that
[1:05:53] certain day
[1:05:54] right if you want God to be this well
[1:05:57] guess what that's what God is to you and
[1:05:59] if you feel that God is that well that's
[1:06:02] what God is to you but they're
[1:06:05] worshiping Satan and they don't even
[1:06:07] realize it they're worshiping God all
[1:06:09] right but they're not worshiping the God
[1:06:12] of this Bible they're not worshiping the
[1:06:14] God of all creation because he never
[1:06:18] changes because he is the same yesterday
[1:06:21] today and forever so therefore we we
[1:06:24] think my I don't want God to change to
[1:06:27] my thoughts or my feelings but I want to
[1:06:30] change to how God wants me to
[1:06:33] be I believe that that's the desire of
[1:06:36] every
[1:06:37] believer we find out that in the be uh
[1:06:40] the N see a council
[1:06:43] there what did they do they they all got
[1:06:46] together and they came together and they
[1:06:48] come up with this Doctrine and they came
[1:06:50] up with that Doctrine and all of a
[1:06:52] sudden we have the doctrine of the
[1:06:55] Trinity what what were they doing they
[1:06:57] were making God according to what they
[1:07:01] thought he was but the scripture says
[1:07:04] here o Israel the Lord thy God is one
[1:07:07] Lord he's not three separate
[1:07:11] persons but he's one God what did they
[1:07:14] do whenever they split God up into three
[1:07:17] people they took away the
[1:07:20] power any wonder that people would say
[1:07:23] well go God isn't alive today because
[1:07:26] there's no Miracles there's no signs
[1:07:28] there's there's nothing being done if
[1:07:30] and if I could think of one of the
[1:07:32] things that brother brandham did in his
[1:07:35] ministry he brought the god of History
[1:07:37] into our present time why because he
[1:07:40] brought us back into the revelation of
[1:07:43] the Lord Jesus Christ he brought us back
[1:07:46] into the name because there's life
[1:07:49] behind the
[1:07:51] name yes sir anything that you say or do
[1:07:54] do it all in what the name of Jesus
[1:07:57] Christ whether in word whether In Deed
[1:08:00] whether you're at work whether you're at
[1:08:02] school whether you're at home with your
[1:08:04] family do all
[1:08:07] things and if you can't do it in the
[1:08:09] name of Jesus Christ don't do
[1:08:11] it if you can't go there in the name of
[1:08:14] Jesus Christ don't go
[1:08:17] there amen
[1:08:20] amen
[1:08:22] amen 196 65 who is this
[1:08:25] MDC brother brandham says paragraph 55
[1:08:29] notice now his
[1:08:32] attribute then the attribute was first
[1:08:34] God the thought the attribute itself all
[1:08:38] in one without being
[1:08:42] expressed then when he expressed
[1:08:44] secondarily he became the word and the
[1:08:47] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:08:49] St John the first chapter and the first
[1:08:51] verse in the beginning but before for
[1:08:54] the Eternal notice in the beginning was
[1:08:56] the word when the time began it was word
[1:08:59] but before it was word it was attribute
[1:09:02] a thought so we realized that God dwelt
[1:09:05] Alone with his thoughts and everything
[1:09:07] that we see is an expression of the
[1:09:09] thoughts of almighty God can you say
[1:09:12] amen
[1:09:13] amen he says and then the word became
[1:09:16] flesh and dwelt Among Us he said hold
[1:09:20] that there now notice his first being
[1:09:22] was Spirit God Supernatural all right
[1:09:25] the great Eternal second he begin to
[1:09:27] form himself towards flesh in a
[1:09:30] theophany it's called the word a body so
[1:09:35] now what is a
[1:09:49] theophonic he was in the form of theop
[1:09:54] now we'll get into that and prove it in
[1:09:56] a few minutes the Lord willing he was
[1:09:59] the word now God begins to condescend
[1:10:04] and I know I I I probably sound like a
[1:10:06] little bit of a a broken record but
[1:10:09] that's okay uh you can just bear with me
[1:10:12] all right but God be to condescend and
[1:10:16] the reason that he was coming down to
[1:10:19] earth is because he wanted to fulfill
[1:10:22] the plan that he had in his mind since
[1:10:24] the foundations of the world and so we
[1:10:27] realize that God begin to condescend
[1:10:31] that he might meet us that we might
[1:10:33] Ascend to where he is and so the word of
[1:10:37] God became flesh that the flesh you and
[1:10:41] I might become the word cuz we're going
[1:10:45] to see that we bypassed our word
[1:10:48] theophany body that we might come here
[1:10:51] to Earth to be tempted by sin and so
[1:10:55] what's God's desire his desire is that
[1:10:58] we stay not in this body of Flesh that
[1:11:01] is corruptible and it was made by sin
[1:11:04] but his desire is that we would go back
[1:11:07] to that word
[1:11:09] body that's when you know all things
[1:11:14] Hallelujah excuse me praise the Lord and
[1:11:18] that body that body is all
[1:11:22] knowing and in that body there's no sin
[1:11:26] that's why we have to be changed because
[1:11:29] we were born in sin shaped in anity come
[1:11:32] to the world speaking lies why because
[1:11:35] of the conception and in how we were
[1:11:38] birthed so therefore not only do we have
[1:11:40] to be born again but this vile body that
[1:11:44] we dwell in it must be changed because
[1:11:47] no sin can come into the presence of
[1:11:52] God so we realize that when he met with
[1:11:56] Abraham he was in his theophany body
[1:12:00] when he when he passed by Moses Moses
[1:12:04] saw the hindered parts of God he saw the
[1:12:07] the back of God and what did it look
[1:12:09] like it looked like the image of a
[1:12:13] man we realize that when he was uh uh
[1:12:17] with the Hebrew children there in the
[1:12:19] fiery furnace there was an image of a
[1:12:22] man that looked like like the son of man
[1:12:25] what were these things it was the
[1:12:27] theophany of God
[1:12:31] himself when Jesus died and he was
[1:12:33] buried in the Tomb and he went to hell
[1:12:36] and he preached to them uh those Sinners
[1:12:39] down there in hell guess what body he
[1:12:41] was in a theophany
[1:12:46] body it is the same God that is moving
[1:12:49] down through time but he's just changing
[1:12:53] his m askk as he goes
[1:12:56] along now brother brandom ties this
[1:12:59] scripture this uh this together with the
[1:13:01] scripture of 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 1
[1:13:05] and it says for we know that if our
[1:13:07] Earthly House of this Tabernacle we're
[1:13:09] dissolved we have a building of God not
[1:13:13] made with hands Eternal in the heavens
[1:13:17] this is our theophany body this is the
[1:13:21] body that we have whenever if if we were
[1:13:24] to pass on and we were to go beyond the
[1:13:27] curtain of time this is the body that we
[1:13:29] go to hallelujah we're not just some
[1:13:33] little cloud or some little imagination
[1:13:36] or something remember brother Bram he
[1:13:38] gives the story he says my I thought I
[1:13:40] always was scared of death because I
[1:13:43] always thought would I know brother
[1:13:45] Neville and would I know this brother
[1:13:47] and and we' just be like this little
[1:13:49] Cloud just floating about in eternity he
[1:13:52] said no when I passed the curtain of
[1:13:54] time he said I didn't fear death no more
[1:13:57] because it's real they're real people
[1:14:00] they're people that can see people that
[1:14:02] can touch people that can hug people
[1:14:05] that can feel they're real people what
[1:14:08] is it it's a different body but the same
[1:14:12] person so now we come to find out that
[1:14:15] death does not change our Dwelling Place
[1:14:19] our death does not change us excuse me
[1:14:22] but it just Chang changes our Dwelling
[1:14:26] Place God is so good to
[1:14:29] us that though this body
[1:14:33] deteriorates and though this body decays
[1:14:36] and though you might lose a couple of
[1:14:38] legs brother Neil on the other side of
[1:14:42] that we have a perfect body a body that
[1:14:46] is not made by hands but a body that is
[1:14:49] made by the word of God Amen now watch
[1:14:52] what he does to the
[1:14:54] Sinners there's a question and it says
[1:14:57] what body uh do those who have never
[1:14:59] accepted Christ what body do they
[1:15:02] resurrect in he said the same body that
[1:15:05] they went down in they don't get no new
[1:15:08] body whatever however they died and
[1:15:12] however their body looked at that time
[1:15:14] that's how they're going to look oh my
[1:15:18] what a God that we
[1:15:22] serve full of grace full of Mercy Full
[1:15:27] Of Love full of
[1:15:32] compassion 1960 H uh having con
[1:15:37] conferences and here come in he's
[1:15:40] talking about when he passed the curtain
[1:15:41] of time looked like they were had kind
[1:15:44] of shaggy hair on their shoulder and
[1:15:48] they were the nicest looking people I
[1:15:50] ever seen eyes is staring
[1:15:53] pearly white teeth they were throwing
[1:15:56] their arms around me and saying oh our
[1:15:58] precious brother and one of them
[1:16:00] hollered at the other one and said think
[1:16:03] he's arrived he's arrived at last and
[1:16:08] when I read this portion of this of this
[1:16:11] sermon here I realized that they noticed
[1:16:16] who he
[1:16:17] was they knew exactly who he was though
[1:16:21] he was a a young man with curly black
[1:16:24] hair and though he was in the uh the he
[1:16:27] looked like he was in the Youth of life
[1:16:29] again he didn't look like how he was
[1:16:31] when he was preaching but they knew
[1:16:33] exactly who brother brandham was and
[1:16:35] there was another lady and she and uh
[1:16:38] remember the lady and the and the angel
[1:16:40] told him and said you you recognize
[1:16:43] her on the one that you've been admiring
[1:16:47] the one that you've been looking at he
[1:16:48] said no I don't you led her to God when
[1:16:52] she was 9 0 plus years old and now she
[1:16:56] begins to witness to brother brandom and
[1:17:00] she begins to tell them of the things
[1:17:02] that's going to happen uh if if I can
[1:17:04] remember how it goes that um that uh she
[1:17:09] told him no we have to stay here a while
[1:17:11] and then you're going to take us over
[1:17:13] here and meet Jesus and all these
[1:17:15] different things she knew exactly who he
[1:17:21] was understand
[1:17:23] whenever we cross over the other side
[1:17:26] you're going to know exactly who those
[1:17:28] people are and you're going to recognize
[1:17:31] one another and you're going to say my
[1:17:34] precious brother my precious sister
[1:17:37] you're here finally you're here you've
[1:17:41] made it there will be a remembrance of
[1:17:44] the good
[1:17:46] things there be no remembrance of the of
[1:17:50] the things that you suffered and the sin
[1:17:52] that you struck struggled with in this
[1:17:54] life no no because you're in a new body
[1:17:57] you're in a perfect body you have a
[1:17:59] perfect mind that is not surrounded by
[1:18:02] complexes of life but it'll be perfect
[1:18:06] and you'll love one another in
[1:18:09] perfectness because it'll be perfect
[1:18:13] love you won't remember how somebody did
[1:18:16] a brother deal on you yep brother deals
[1:18:20] will be washed from your remembrance
[1:18:22] amen all you remember is I know that
[1:18:25] face and God bless you what do we ought
[1:18:28] to do right now as we're here a yeah he
[1:18:31] gave me a brother deal it didn't work
[1:18:33] out God bless you you are my brother I
[1:18:38] forgive
[1:18:39] you
[1:18:44] amen and who is this MDC n uh paragraph
[1:18:50] 68 he says now the difference between
[1:18:52] him and you as a son see he was at the
[1:18:56] beginning the word now he's going to
[1:18:59] make a distinction between us as sons
[1:19:02] and daughters and as Jesus as a son he
[1:19:06] said he was the word and in morab body
[1:19:09] he came and lived in that in the person
[1:19:11] of MDC then later we never heard no more
[1:19:15] of MDC because he became Jesus Christ
[1:19:18] MDC was the priest but he became Jesus
[1:19:22] Christ now watch this he says now you
[1:19:25] bypassed that so now he's talking to you
[1:19:28] and I what did we bypass we bypassed
[1:19:32] that word
[1:19:34] body because in that form he knowed all
[1:19:38] things and you never been able to know
[1:19:41] that yet you come like Adam like me you
[1:19:44] became from the attribute to the
[1:19:48] flesh to be
[1:19:51] tempted I want want to ask you which one
[1:19:54] of us are exempt from
[1:19:56] Temptations which one of us are exempt
[1:19:59] from trials and tribulations none of us
[1:20:02] why because it was all in the plan of
[1:20:05] God Almighty that we would bypass that
[1:20:08] word body and come down in the flesh
[1:20:10] that we might be tempted so if you're
[1:20:14] tempted if you're tempted you are
[1:20:17] blessed
[1:20:20] amen that's a tough one to swallow isn't
[1:20:22] it yeah all of you are saying uh-uh I
[1:20:25] don't feel no blessing when I'm tempted
[1:20:28] yeah you're
[1:20:30] blessed he said but when this life is
[1:20:33] finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:20:35] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:20:37] that's where we go that is the word then
[1:20:41] we can look back and see what we done
[1:20:43] now we don't understand it we have never
[1:20:45] become the word what's he talking about
[1:20:48] he's talking about the word and its
[1:20:51] fullness amen let me say this though we
[1:20:55] are
[1:20:56] becoming the word we have not become the
[1:21:00] word but we are becoming the word until
[1:21:04] there will come a time where we will
[1:21:06] become the
[1:21:13] word we got something to look forward to
[1:21:16] we got something to be happy about why
[1:21:18] because this isn't our last dwelling
[1:21:20] place we got something to reach joice
[1:21:23] why because I'm going somewhere I'm I'm
[1:21:25] I'm on a journey I'm going to a a final
[1:21:28] destination where I'm going to become
[1:21:30] what I've always desired to
[1:21:32] be Hallelujah you won't have to have to
[1:21:35] make it up you won't have to try or push
[1:21:38] or prog no you'll be the word in its
[1:21:43] fullness that's why we get so
[1:21:45] discouraged sometimes in ourselves it's
[1:21:47] because we have this something within us
[1:21:50] that's crying out that I want to be
[1:21:52] perfect
[1:21:53] I I I I I want to be the word in its
[1:21:55] fullness and you get so discouraged in
[1:21:58] yourself but understand there's a place
[1:22:00] that we're going to there's a destiny
[1:22:04] that every believer has a destination
[1:22:07] that we will become the word
[1:22:10] [Applause]
[1:22:12] itself you say brother how is that
[1:22:15] possible because you were in the word in
[1:22:18] the
[1:22:20] beginning Oh Glory
[1:22:27] he
[1:22:28] says Ah but and look clearly makes it
[1:22:31] clear you will never be the word unless
[1:22:34] you was a thought at the
[1:22:36] beginning that proves a predestination
[1:22:38] of God see you can't be the word unless
[1:22:42] you were a
[1:22:43] thought Hallelujah you had to be in the
[1:22:47] thinking
[1:22:49] first
[1:22:51] it amen but you see in order to stand
[1:22:57] Temptation you had to bypass the the
[1:23:00] offy you had to come down here in
[1:23:04] flesh to be tempted by sin and then if
[1:23:09] you stand all the father has given me
[1:23:10] will come onto me and I'll raise him up
[1:23:12] in the last days see you had to be
[1:23:18] first I got to
[1:23:20] thinking why would God
[1:23:23] let us bypass our
[1:23:25] theophany why would God let us come to a
[1:23:29] place where we would be in this flesh
[1:23:33] and that he had a thought in his mind
[1:23:36] that you and I would be tempted of sin
[1:23:40] that you and I would be tempted by
[1:23:41] trials in our lives and by Temptations
[1:23:44] in our lives and by all these different
[1:23:46] things that seem to go wrong in our
[1:23:48] lives why would God do that to us if we
[1:23:51] were sons and daughters
[1:23:54] why would he do it if he loved
[1:23:56] us if God was this big Fountain of Love
[1:23:59] why would he bring me here as one of his
[1:24:02] kin folk why would he bring me here as
[1:24:05] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone
[1:24:07] to be tempted of
[1:24:11] sin and so I asked myself that question
[1:24:16] why would God have us bypass our
[1:24:18] theophany and as I begin to think of
[1:24:21] this I I thought of Temptation and I
[1:24:24] thought of Temptation by sin and there's
[1:24:27] one of two things that happen whenever
[1:24:29] we are tempted of sin whenever we're
[1:24:33] tempted by unbelief in our
[1:24:35] lives one thing that H that could happen
[1:24:38] is you
[1:24:41] overcome you overcome the trial you
[1:24:43] overcome the thought you overcome it and
[1:24:46] and and you overcome this and you
[1:24:48] overcome that and my goodness you feel
[1:24:49] real
[1:24:51] good but the other thing that happens is
[1:24:54] that we
[1:24:56] fall we have a Temptation we have this
[1:24:59] thought we have this reaction to an
[1:25:02] action in our lives and it causes us to
[1:25:06] fall in sin one of two things that
[1:25:09] happens right understand that God uses
[1:25:13] both the
[1:25:14] overcoming and the falling in our flesh
[1:25:18] for his own benefit and for our own good
[1:25:21] amen amen when we overcome anything my
[1:25:24] it it makes us feel that God is really
[1:25:27] with us doesn't it it makes us feel good
[1:25:30] it it gives us uh a strengthen our faith
[1:25:33] and we think my goodness I could run
[1:25:35] through a troop and I could leap over a
[1:25:38] wall and I could do all these different
[1:25:40] things and I feel like I could just cut
[1:25:42] any devil's head off and and and my
[1:25:45] goodness my I got big Burly Faith
[1:25:47] muscles and it feels so good you feel
[1:25:50] that God is with you
[1:25:52] and God is with you and God is letting
[1:25:55] us go through those experience for us to
[1:25:58] realize that number one he is with us
[1:26:02] and number two that he is mighty in
[1:26:05] [Applause]
[1:26:08] battle but when the fall
[1:26:11] comes and perhaps I'm not the only one
[1:26:14] here this morning I feel like I fall
[1:26:17] more than what I overcome amen I feel
[1:26:21] like I mess up more than more than what
[1:26:24] I do
[1:26:25] right it doesn't matter the desire
[1:26:28] that's in my heart sometimes I it just
[1:26:32] seems that I the I undergo amen I react
[1:26:37] the wrong way I say the wrong thing I do
[1:26:42] the wrong thing I and it just I I
[1:26:45] sometimes I feel like the Apostle Paul
[1:26:47] and I say oh the vile rested miserable
[1:26:52] guy that you
[1:26:53] are you need a good
[1:26:59] slapping you know sometimes I wish that
[1:27:01] God would whip me real
[1:27:03] hard I deserve
[1:27:06] it
[1:27:07] sure I deserve a hard whipping Papa God
[1:27:12] and he comes over and he corrects you
[1:27:14] out of love
[1:27:17] am what is God showing to us in that
[1:27:20] time that those you deserved judgment
[1:27:24] but though you deserved a good old
[1:27:27] weaping from Papa God yet he corrects Us
[1:27:30] in love and we think my the mercy and
[1:27:33] grace of God in my life I didn't deserve
[1:27:37] this kind of Correction but he's given
[1:27:39] it to me anyways Hallelujah what's God
[1:27:42] doing he's revealing his grace to you
[1:27:45] he's revealing his Mercy to
[1:27:51] you
[1:27:55] we find out when we
[1:27:57] fall he picks us back up amen when we're
[1:28:01] discouraged in our mind and in our flesh
[1:28:05] he gives us
[1:28:06] encouragement when we're sick under I'm
[1:28:09] talking about trials and
[1:28:11] temptations tribulations in our flesh
[1:28:14] when we're sick what does he do he heals
[1:28:17] our bodies whenever we have a need in
[1:28:20] our lives he's Jehovah jar he meets that
[1:28:23] need that's within our
[1:28:25] lives when we deserve punishment he
[1:28:28] gives us Grace when we deserve judgment
[1:28:31] guess what the mercy of God it overflows
[1:28:35] whatever uh whatever bad thing that
[1:28:38] you've done in your
[1:28:40] life so we when we begin to see these
[1:28:44] things I realize that God reveals
[1:28:48] himself more in our downfalls right than
[1:28:52] he does when we
[1:28:54] overcome God reveals himself more in our
[1:28:58] downfalls in our mistakes and failures
[1:29:02] than he does when we
[1:29:05] overcome thank you Lord CU a lot of
[1:29:07] times when we
[1:29:09] overcome we
[1:29:11] think look what I
[1:29:14] did I overcame that I did this and so
[1:29:18] much of the time we get so prideful
[1:29:20] whenever it's God
[1:29:22] that's doing the overcoming in our
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:26] lives so what is God doing now through
[1:29:30] the things that we suffer in this life
[1:29:33] he is revealing to us his great
[1:29:37] attributes that's
[1:29:39] right James 1: 2 and 4 my brethren count
[1:29:44] it all joy when you fall into diverse
[1:29:48] Temptations knowing this that the trying
[1:29:50] of your faith work is patience
[1:29:52] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:29:55] that ye may be perfect and entire
[1:29:58] wanting nothing now we realize that the
[1:30:01] scripture says this that all things work
[1:30:05] together for the
[1:30:07] good finish the quote finish the
[1:30:10] scripture to those who love God
[1:30:13] Amen and are called according to his
[1:30:17] purpose so we realize that this
[1:30:20] scripture is only for the bride it is
[1:30:24] only for us who are called according to
[1:30:27] his purpose because he has a purpose in
[1:30:30] his calling in which he has called us in
[1:30:32] this life that's right but all things
[1:30:35] don't work together for the good to
[1:30:37] those who are not
[1:30:39] called for those who are not called
[1:30:41] according to his purpose to those who do
[1:30:44] not love God Amen all things do not work
[1:30:48] together for the good of those people
[1:30:52] that's why you could have the same
[1:30:54] situation as somebody else as an
[1:30:57] unbeliever and they could take their
[1:30:59] lives and you can have a peace of God
[1:31:02] within your heart why because it's
[1:31:04] working together for the
[1:31:10] good so now we we see this that it says
[1:31:15] counted all joy when you enter into
[1:31:18] diverse
[1:31:20] Temptations how many view are so joyful
[1:31:22] this morning of the trials and
[1:31:25] tribulations and temptations of L aa oh
[1:31:29] well praise God hallelujah I am so
[1:31:31] joyful and I feel so good and and and
[1:31:34] and this is just wonderful I've had the
[1:31:36] worst day of my
[1:31:38] life this is excellent I love it so much
[1:31:44] Lord there ain't one of us thinks like
[1:31:47] that give me your medication if you do
[1:31:53] I would like some of it happy pills
[1:31:59] huh the gosp pill is only the only thing
[1:32:02] that give you happiness amen yes but
[1:32:05] what is it it's when you have the
[1:32:07] revelation
[1:32:09] of I know this is happening in my life I
[1:32:13] know I've had a refere I know and I know
[1:32:15] and I know but I'm understanding that
[1:32:19] the scripture says because we always
[1:32:22] want to bring it back to what the
[1:32:23] scripture says because the scriptures
[1:32:25] are absolute we can't bring it back to
[1:32:28] some psychology of man well yeah and try
[1:32:32] to work it out and and and watch these
[1:32:34] different videos online no take it all
[1:32:36] back to the
[1:32:38] word and so I can take it back to the
[1:32:40] word and say I understand that this
[1:32:43] might not be joyful at the time I
[1:32:46] understand that I might not be joyous
[1:32:49] and happy at this time but I know that
[1:32:52] God is doing something in my life and I
[1:32:54] know that it is working together for the
[1:32:57] good
[1:32:58] amen amen and so that's where we can
[1:33:02] have the joy of our
[1:33:04] Salvation right amen amen not that you
[1:33:08] feel good going through stuff right but
[1:33:11] that you have a joy in knowing that I've
[1:33:14] been called and I love God according to
[1:33:17] his purpose I know this is working
[1:33:19] together for my good it may not be nice
[1:33:22] I may not be happy but I understand that
[1:33:26] God is working in my
[1:33:29] life it's good for us to remind
[1:33:31] ourselves of these things always bring
[1:33:34] it back to the
[1:33:36] scriptures
[1:33:38] amen because the scripture has the
[1:33:40] answer right the scripture has the
[1:33:44] antidote
[1:33:46] Hallelujah I find myself praying in
[1:33:50] times of
[1:33:53] distress and Times
[1:33:56] of how would I put
[1:33:58] it
[1:33:59] uh uh I don't really get anxiety but
[1:34:04] perhaps I do and I don't realize it CU
[1:34:06] I'm just mad sometimes huh times of this
[1:34:10] and Times of that I I realize I don't
[1:34:13] pray for God to take it
[1:34:17] away I don't ask God why it's not my
[1:34:20] business to know why
[1:34:22] I don't care according to the flesh man
[1:34:26] but I know why according to the
[1:34:28] spiritual man it cuz I know what God is
[1:34:31] doing I know he's molding my character I
[1:34:34] know he's doing something in my life CU
[1:34:36] he has a desire to bring me into the
[1:34:39] image of the word because I am not the
[1:34:42] word in its fullness now but I am
[1:34:44] becoming the word sermon by sermon
[1:34:47] message by message scripture by
[1:34:49] scripture day by day guess what's
[1:34:52] happening I am becoming the word because
[1:34:55] I'm being Washed by the
[1:34:58] word and so I I I I tend not to have a
[1:35:02] pity party but I say father give me the
[1:35:06] strength to overcome this thing that I'm
[1:35:09] going through in my life and you'll see
[1:35:12] that God will give you the strength to
[1:35:19] overcoming Hallelujah
[1:35:22] the angels in
[1:35:24] heaven the ones that worship before
[1:35:27] God the ones that are before his very
[1:35:30] Presence at all times will never know
[1:35:34] God like you will know Papa
[1:35:38] God there's not one angel in heaven that
[1:35:41] can sing the song of Amazing Grace How
[1:35:44] Sweet the Sound with the revelation of
[1:35:47] somebody that has found Grace in God the
[1:35:50] angels and in heaven can never talk
[1:35:53] about God's mercy in their lives when
[1:35:56] they deserve judgment because they never
[1:35:58] went through that stage they were
[1:36:01] perfect they're without sin they're
[1:36:03] before his presence at all times but
[1:36:06] when we come Hallelujah when we come
[1:36:09] before God understand the angels will
[1:36:12] have to stay silent why because they
[1:36:15] can't
[1:36:17] worship how a blood bought sinner in
[1:36:21] this Earth can worship God why because
[1:36:24] we realize where we came from and to
[1:36:27] where we are in his presence and we say
[1:36:30] father I'm so undeserving but I worship
[1:36:32] you Lord thank you
[1:36:35] God hallelujah so let me ask you whose
[1:36:39] worship is
[1:36:41] greater the angels in heaven are your
[1:36:45] worship here on
[1:36:46] Earth oh my God your worship and your
[1:36:52] praise and your adoration goes Before
[1:36:55] the Throne of
[1:36:58] God and he loves to hear that more than
[1:37:02] the worship of all these
[1:37:06] angels cuz they were made to worship
[1:37:09] that's right they're told to worship
[1:37:12] that's their job is to worship but you
[1:37:14] and I are on free moral
[1:37:18] agency we're not told to do anything
[1:37:22] but we do it out of
[1:37:25] love we do it because we want to we
[1:37:28] worship God because it's a desire that's
[1:37:31] in our hearts not because somebody told
[1:37:34] us to do it you're at church today not
[1:37:37] because somebody told you to come but
[1:37:39] because you have a desire of God that he
[1:37:42] has placed in your heart to worship
[1:37:44] [Applause]
[1:37:49] him now we really realize that the word
[1:37:53] was made flesh and that and the word is
[1:37:56] still
[1:37:57] flesh and it's made manifest amongst us
[1:38:00] it's the great mystery of God is now
[1:38:03] being fulfilled before our very eyes
[1:38:06] that is Christ in you the hope of
[1:38:09] glory and we say it a lot and we preach
[1:38:13] it a lot but yet it's the truth because
[1:38:17] it's where we're at in the timeline of
[1:38:19] God now
[1:38:22] sometimes to us it's a
[1:38:25] mystery sometimes when Satan looks at us
[1:38:29] he says oh yeah that's definitely a son
[1:38:30] or a daughter of God that's him he's a
[1:38:34] son I seen how that went and then
[1:38:37] there's other times he looks at us and
[1:38:38] he goes that ain't no son or daughter of
[1:38:41] God it's a
[1:38:43] mystery that's a
[1:38:45] mystery but I want to bring this to a
[1:38:48] place
[1:38:49] of we speak about it and we preach about
[1:38:52] it a lot and we realize that it's the
[1:38:55] truth but what does it really mean for
[1:38:59] the word to be made flesh in this
[1:39:02] hour not only what does it mean but what
[1:39:05] does it look like right how does the
[1:39:07] word act how does the word behave itself
[1:39:11] how does the word look when it's being
[1:39:13] manifested amongst the
[1:39:16] people Colossians 1:26 and 27 even the
[1:39:20] mystery which has been hid from ages and
[1:39:22] from Generations but now it's being made
[1:39:25] manifest to his Saints to whom God would
[1:39:28] be known what is the riches of the glory
[1:39:30] of his mystery among the Gentiles which
[1:39:33] is Christ in you the hope of glory in
[1:39:36] the sermon marage and divorce paragraph
[1:39:38] 258 brother brandham says and so is it
[1:39:41] with the church that refuses to become
[1:39:44] pregnated in the age that we now live in
[1:39:47] to bring forth children of this age so
[1:39:50] there's a purpose there's a desire that
[1:39:53] God has and that's to bring forth
[1:39:55] children of this age we are not
[1:39:57] lutherans we're not Wesley neither are
[1:40:00] we Pentecostals we've got to be the
[1:40:02] children of this age through the
[1:40:06] pregnancy of the word of God to bring
[1:40:09] forth a child of this age he says it's
[1:40:13] the seed child amen I hope you
[1:40:17] understand couldn't be pregnated no so
[1:40:19] what did he do put her away in forcement
[1:40:21] that's right but she dares put him away
[1:40:24] put her away he put her away he went
[1:40:26] right on revealing his word to the body
[1:40:29] and vindicating him Same by himself his
[1:40:32] children begin to kind of look more like
[1:40:35] him because it's fully maturing or they
[1:40:39] become children of the word not children
[1:40:43] of the
[1:40:44] church so whenever we preach from the
[1:40:47] word it's going to bring forth a word
[1:40:50] birth birth and when a word birth
[1:40:53] happens it brings forth a word child or
[1:40:56] a seed child of this age not just
[1:41:00] stopping at
[1:41:01] justification justification is okay but
[1:41:04] that was in Luther's day not just
[1:41:07] stopping at a cleaned up life not just
[1:41:09] stopping at the restoration of the gifts
[1:41:12] not just stopping at cuz the three
[1:41:15] combined they bring the new
[1:41:18] birth but he said going on
[1:41:22] not
[1:41:23] stopping going past these things into
[1:41:28] this age that we are now living in what
[1:41:30] is this age it is age of adoption it is
[1:41:35] age of full Authority and power it is
[1:41:39] the age of knowing our position in
[1:41:42] Christ knowing when to speak to speak
[1:41:45] when he tells us to speak and knowing to
[1:41:48] say stay silent when he tells us to be
[1:41:51] silent that's the work of the Bride in
[1:41:54] this day the work of the Bride is not to
[1:41:57] try to manufacture something up of
[1:42:00] another age but when he tells us to be
[1:42:03] quiet we stay still why because his wife
[1:42:07] is an obedient wife she is an obedient
[1:42:10] woman and she wants to please her
[1:42:16] husband so he doesn't speak she doesn't
[1:42:19] speak very good but when he tells her to
[1:42:22] speak she speaks and not only does she
[1:42:25] speak but she speaks with
[1:42:29] authority how can she speak with
[1:42:32] authority because she has the backing of
[1:42:35] her
[1:42:36] husband because when she is speaking she
[1:42:40] is saying the same thing that he is
[1:42:42] saying the spirit and the bride say come
[1:42:46] you remember when the the brother Brown
[1:42:48] talks about the Capstone what is it that
[1:42:50] it's Grace it's
[1:42:53] [Applause]
[1:42:55] Grace did you know that we're living
[1:42:57] right
[1:42:59] now in the Capstone ministry right yes
[1:43:04] sir many of you you all you all know the
[1:43:07] pyramid and brother brandham talks about
[1:43:09] the pyramids in Egypt and he types these
[1:43:12] pyramids out and he says each
[1:43:16] slab of rock lays upon each slab of rock
[1:43:20] just perect L and it's so well
[1:43:23] manufactured and built that you can't
[1:43:26] put a razor blade between each one right
[1:43:30] and so now through Luther and Wesley and
[1:43:33] Pentecost now brother brandom comes
[1:43:35] along and he comes along with a message
[1:43:39] that is making a way for the Capstone
[1:43:43] itself when penic cost had its Doctrine
[1:43:47] and it its principles that it followed
[1:43:49] that uh that that that speaking in
[1:43:52] tongues is the evidence of the Holy
[1:43:53] Ghost and and Sensations and all these
[1:43:56] different things that was that was going
[1:43:58] wild and Loosely amongst the Pentecostal
[1:44:01] people brother brandom had to come along
[1:44:04] and correct it so they were building on
[1:44:07] top of Wesley but they were not building
[1:44:11] correctly because the rocks that were
[1:44:13] they were putting on top of Wesley there
[1:44:16] was one up here and one down here and
[1:44:18] one up here and one down here and one
[1:44:20] was trinitarian and one was Oneness and
[1:44:22] one was this and one was that and there
[1:44:24] was absolutely no way that the Capstone
[1:44:26] could come down and sit perfectly upon
[1:44:30] Pentecost so now we have Elijah the
[1:44:33] prophet just as he was uh back on Mount
[1:44:37] Carmel and he took those stones the of
[1:44:41] the altar that was dismantled he didn't
[1:44:43] take no new Stones he didn't take no new
[1:44:46] rocks but he took the same ones the same
[1:44:49] revelation the same scriptures and now
[1:44:52] he begins to set them in order and he
[1:44:55] says this doesn't belong over here and
[1:44:58] this doesn't belong over here but I'm
[1:45:00] going to switch them because they belong
[1:45:02] in the plan of
[1:45:04] God and he put them in its rightful
[1:45:08] position
[1:45:11] amen why was he doing that because the
[1:45:15] Capstone was coming the Capstone was
[1:45:18] luring and there had to be a Ministry
[1:45:21] that it would flatten out the rest and
[1:45:23] say now it's ready now it's ready the
[1:45:26] ground has been prepared the altar has
[1:45:29] been made we're ready for this Capstone
[1:45:31] Ministry what is the cloud all about
[1:45:34] it's a
[1:45:36] Capstone yes sir the very Mind Of God
[1:45:40] coming down to his people why did it
[1:45:44] come down because the first part of his
[1:45:46] ministry was done it was no longer a
[1:45:49] public show before the people
[1:45:52] people but here he come condescending
[1:45:56] condescending why because the time was
[1:46:00] [Applause]
[1:46:01] right amen what is this great mysterious
[1:46:05] Cloud yeah sir is it just a a picture in
[1:46:09] Life
[1:46:11] Magazine is it just something that
[1:46:13] people saw in Tucson and these different
[1:46:16] places what is the attraction at sunset
[1:46:21] Mountain at the time of
[1:46:23] sunset the sun setting and the the sands
[1:46:26] of time disappearing what is this
[1:46:29] attraction it is God fulfilling his word
[1:46:34] it is god making his word manifested it
[1:46:38] is God coming as a judge
[1:46:41] now brother
[1:46:43] brandom what was he doing in the early
[1:46:45] parts of his ministry is making the
[1:46:47] circle bigger oh praise the Lord You're
[1:46:50] all my brethren but after the opening of
[1:46:52] the seals things changed in his ministry
[1:46:56] there was no longer a public Ministry
[1:46:59] but he would you understand that a lot
[1:47:01] of brother brandham
[1:47:03] sermons doctrinal teachings where did he
[1:47:06] preach him he preach him in
[1:47:08] Tucson did he preach him in
[1:47:11] Phoenix Jeffersonville amen he said if I
[1:47:15] got a new sermon or a new thought I'll
[1:47:17] preach it here first at the church at
[1:47:20] the brandham
[1:47:23] Tabernacle no longer a public
[1:47:27] show he's not preaching Doctrine out
[1:47:29] over here in worldwide evangelism but
[1:47:32] now he really starts to preach Doctrine
[1:47:34] right serpent seed you think brother
[1:47:38] brandham could have preached uh where I
[1:47:40] think uh Pentecost failed had a
[1:47:44] Pentecostal
[1:47:46] Church yeah don't come
[1:47:49] back
[1:47:51] but he had a place what was it the
[1:47:54] doctrinal teachings of his ministry was
[1:47:56] not for the
[1:47:57] public so now
[1:48:00] Jesus Takes the people and he speaks in
[1:48:05] Parables and so now the disciples come
[1:48:08] to a point and say Lord can can you can
[1:48:10] you teach us you see you got to ask
[1:48:13] God if you don't ask God God ain't going
[1:48:16] to help if you don't ask God God's not
[1:48:19] going to reveal anything to you if you
[1:48:21] never ask for help in your life you will
[1:48:24] never receive
[1:48:26] help amen amen and so now he takes him
[1:48:30] to the side he says unto you it is given
[1:48:32] but unto them it's not given to know the
[1:48:35] mysteries of
[1:48:37] God I thought about
[1:48:40] this why wouldn't he just choose the 12
[1:48:45] disciples and why wouldn't he just take
[1:48:47] them to a side and teach them old things
[1:48:48] and forget everybody else
[1:48:52] why would he let the multitudes follow
[1:48:54] them and then why would he let the
[1:48:56] multitudes Fall
[1:48:57] Away Jesus's mission on Earth was that
[1:49:01] the scriptures might be fulfilled right
[1:49:04] yeah that having ears to hear they would
[1:49:07] hear not and having eyes to see they
[1:49:10] would understand not what would they not
[1:49:13] hear or understand they wouldn't
[1:49:15] understand the day of the message in
[1:49:17] which they were living in right and so
[1:49:20] God has done the same thing in this day
[1:49:24] this message has attracted many people
[1:49:27] it has attracted many people from many
[1:49:29] parts of the world for many reasons but
[1:49:32] God now is very slowly he has been for
[1:49:36] years this one that doesn't belong and
[1:49:39] this one that is following for for
[1:49:41] reasons that they shouldn't be guess
[1:49:43] what they're starting to fall away why
[1:49:45] is it happening having ears to
[1:49:48] hear what the spirit say says but they
[1:49:51] they can't understand it having eyes to
[1:49:54] see but they they don't understand the
[1:49:57] scripture being fulfilled in our very
[1:50:00] day
[1:50:02] amen praise the
[1:50:07] Lord where am I
[1:50:10] here continuing on with that quote uh
[1:50:13] brother Brenham says and the bride will
[1:50:16] be a lovely little lady of the the
[1:50:22] word
[1:50:24] unadulterated not touched by any man's
[1:50:28] organization any man-made Theory she'll
[1:50:31] be purely unadulterated amen Bride of
[1:50:35] the word amen and amen I hope you get
[1:50:37] that out in the air she will be the
[1:50:40] pregnated daughter of
[1:50:44] God hallelujah we are to receive the
[1:50:47] seed of God in order to be be pregnated
[1:50:51] by the word because we realize that the
[1:50:53] word of God is a seed and that seed will
[1:50:57] always bring forth of its kind and so if
[1:51:00] we are being pregnated of the word we
[1:51:03] are supposed to bring forth the word in
[1:51:06] our
[1:51:08] lives a lovely little lady unadulterated
[1:51:13] untouched
[1:51:15] right perfect not touched by man-made
[1:51:19] creeds
[1:51:20] not touched by theology or theories or
[1:51:24] any of these other things that circle
[1:51:26] around you know so much of the time we
[1:51:29] we we we try to get our answers from
[1:51:31] Google and we try to Google something
[1:51:33] because Google always has the answer and
[1:51:35] Siri always has the answer we need to
[1:51:37] get back to the
[1:51:39] word and instead of looking out here for
[1:51:42] the answer of things look to the word
[1:51:45] because the word is what has our answer
[1:51:48] now so we we understand that when a
[1:51:50] woman becomes pregnant she has received
[1:51:53] seed and she has been pregnated and and
[1:51:56] and and and she begins to show forth
[1:51:59] that she's pregnant right man all of a
[1:52:02] sudden gets a little tiny baby
[1:52:04] bump I show you my baby bump and take a
[1:52:07] picture I always tuck it in right here
[1:52:10] he can't even
[1:52:11] tell but they're so
[1:52:13] excited they're so excited and as the
[1:52:16] belly gets bigger guess what my they
[1:52:20] start to pet that
[1:52:21] thing and rub it and talk to it my sweet
[1:52:26] little child it's in here how I love you
[1:52:30] now to The
[1:52:31] Outsider we think that they're admiring
[1:52:34] their
[1:52:36] belly but they're not admiring their
[1:52:39] belly they're admiring what's growing
[1:52:41] within their
[1:52:42] belly they're admiring the thought of a
[1:52:46] seed a son a daughter that's going to be
[1:52:49] born of them that's that's good that's
[1:52:51] going to be part of their family and
[1:52:53] they wonder who's he going to look like
[1:52:55] who's she going to look like who
[1:52:57] mannerisms are they going to be L and
[1:52:59] there's all these thoughts and and all
[1:53:01] these things that race through our minds
[1:53:04] but the desire of a pregnant person is
[1:53:07] not for them to stay pregnant
[1:53:10] forever just ask a woman that 9 months
[1:53:13] and 10 days
[1:53:13] [Applause]
[1:53:15] pregnant get this baby out
[1:53:21] I'm 10 days over I've waited nine months
[1:53:23] for
[1:53:25] this yeah let them go one day over
[1:53:28] they'll be trying everything get my feet
[1:53:31] rubbed EPs and salts whatever it may be
[1:53:34] everything that Google tells you to
[1:53:38] do my wife would always tell me a good
[1:53:40] back
[1:53:41] rub yeah she did she knew rightly that
[1:53:44] that wouldn't make the baby come
[1:53:47] but
[1:53:48] wisdom my wife has wisdom lots of
[1:53:54] it her desire isn't to stay
[1:53:57] pregnant but her desire is to bring
[1:54:00] forth the Manchild that's right so it is
[1:54:04] with every son or daughter of God our
[1:54:06] desire is not to just be pregnated of
[1:54:08] the word right but it's to give birth
[1:54:11] now to the word of God we realize that
[1:54:14] within us there may not be a baby or
[1:54:17] whatever but a natural type is spiritual
[1:54:20] but within us lays the very Life of
[1:54:23] Christ
[1:54:24] himself and so for order for that life
[1:54:28] to give birth it must manifest itself
[1:54:32] through us who are pregnated by
[1:54:36] it it's not just supposed to stay within
[1:54:40] here but it's supposed to work from the
[1:54:43] inside
[1:54:46] out a Christ child amen
[1:54:51] and that's what brother brandham is
[1:54:52] saying to us as children of the word of
[1:54:54] this age is that we are to bring forth
[1:54:59] not to just let it stay dormant but we
[1:55:02] are to bring forth the Manchild we are
[1:55:05] to bring forth the seed word child and
[1:55:09] that we're not just to let it stay there
[1:55:11] but we are to let it manifest itself
[1:55:13] through
[1:55:16] us the word must be manifested Ed can
[1:55:20] you say amen
[1:55:22] amen the unveiling of
[1:55:24] God Bram says your written Epistles read
[1:55:27] of all
[1:55:28] man I I translate that turn around this
[1:55:31] way see I want you all to turn to each
[1:55:34] other just turn it around you are
[1:55:37] Epistles that has been written go ahead
[1:55:39] and tell your neighbor go
[1:55:41] ahead yeah don't be shy you are an
[1:55:45] epistle that has been written that is
[1:55:48] going to be read of all men cuz you
[1:55:51] can't do nothing to it that's read of
[1:55:54] all men manifested word of God in other
[1:55:59] words so what are we supposed to be the
[1:56:04] manifestation of God himself am not for
[1:56:08] Wesley's age amen not for Luther's age
[1:56:12] right not for the Pentecostal age I tell
[1:56:15] you what to do put them all
[1:56:17] together cuz they're all part of the
[1:56:19] Capstone they're all part of the pyramid
[1:56:22] so when we put them all together at at
[1:56:24] the finishing of time guess what we've
[1:56:26] got we've got a completed full word
[1:56:31] because this seventh Church Angel uh
[1:56:33] Church age messenger he came to complete
[1:56:36] all things amen that's why he wasn't a
[1:56:40] six days messenger cuz that's the number
[1:56:42] of man but seven is the number of
[1:56:46] completion seven Church ages seven seals
[1:56:50] seven thiss seventh messenger what is he
[1:56:53] doing he has completed the work to the
[1:56:58] Gentile dispensation and the only thing
[1:57:01] that's left is the coming of the Lord
[1:57:06] himself it's completed so don't push it
[1:57:10] out but bring it
[1:57:12] in but when you bring it in put it in
[1:57:15] its rightful
[1:57:18] position amen don't get all caught up
[1:57:22] with putting stones and rocks in places
[1:57:24] where they don't belong right but when
[1:57:27] we put them where they
[1:57:29] belong when they put them in its correct
[1:57:33] order within the body and within our
[1:57:36] lives understand it's a complete circle
[1:57:39] it's a completed
[1:57:40] pyramid
[1:57:43] Hallelujah so now God's plan has always
[1:57:46] been that the word would manifest itself
[1:57:50] and that the word now would manifest
[1:57:52] itself through his bride for she is the
[1:57:55] only one who was capable of receiving
[1:57:58] the word in its fullness to bring it
[1:58:01] into full
[1:58:03] manifestation that's the bride she is
[1:58:06] the only one that's capable to receive
[1:58:10] the fullness of the word that she might
[1:58:13] produce the fullness of the word in her
[1:58:17] life as the musician come we'll bring
[1:58:21] this to a
[1:58:23] close like I've been
[1:58:25] saying we can preach about the word
[1:58:28] being made
[1:58:29] flesh and guess what we can all get
[1:58:32] excited right it's something worth
[1:58:35] getting excited over and we can say I
[1:58:39] believe that with all my heart and and
[1:58:41] the word being made manifest and the
[1:58:43] bride in this last day and hurrah hurrah
[1:58:46] harah and we can have ourselves a a big
[1:58:49] old Harrah time a big old a big old time
[1:58:53] at church where we all feel real good
[1:58:55] and we're saying yes I believe that's me
[1:58:57] I'm a complete manifestation of the
[1:59:01] word but what does the word look like
[1:59:05] when it's being
[1:59:07] manifested this is something that I
[1:59:09] would like to get into in future
[1:59:14] Services what does it look like when the
[1:59:16] word is being made
[1:59:17] flesh and dwelling amongst
[1:59:21] us because there's no doubt in our all
[1:59:24] of our
[1:59:25] Lives we want to be more like
[1:59:28] God and we want to be used of God if I
[1:59:32] were to say let me see a raise of hands
[1:59:35] of those of you that would love to be
[1:59:37] used of God more this week I'm sure both
[1:59:41] hands would be lifted and you would say
[1:59:43] father let me be used of you this
[1:59:47] week amen but but a lot of times being
[1:59:51] used of God doesn't go to what our
[1:59:54] perception of being used of God
[1:59:57] is come on so much of the time we think
[2:00:00] of being used of God
[2:00:02] is going and preaching the
[2:00:05] gospel and a lot of people giving their
[2:00:08] hearts to God and and there's a great
[2:00:10] time and a great time of repentance and
[2:00:12] I want to say that that's part of it
[2:00:15] when we think of being used of God we
[2:00:17] think of laying hands upon the a second
[2:00:20] and seeing that person recover or seeing
[2:00:22] that person have a miracle in our lives
[2:00:25] I want to say that that's part of it a
[2:00:27] lot of us think that it's speaking the
[2:00:29] word of God speak onto this mountain be
[2:00:33] thou removed from my life and it's
[2:00:36] removed that's part of
[2:00:38] it but I wonder is there other ways that
[2:00:41] God tries to use us in our
[2:00:43] lives that perhaps we see it as a
[2:00:48] trial perhaps we see it as a tribulation
[2:00:51] brother Mario went to the Philippines
[2:00:53] used of God mightily within the services
[2:00:57] but yet he tells us he had Financial
[2:01:00] [Music]
[2:01:02] issues he had this issue over here he
[2:01:04] went over there because there was
[2:01:06] something wrong with your
[2:01:09] property how was this being used of
[2:01:11] God I thought being used of God just
[2:01:14] produces
[2:01:16] blessings I thought being used of God
[2:01:19] just means that we're walking on cloud n
[2:01:21] all the time and when God speaks to us
[2:01:23] and tells us to do something we do it
[2:01:25] and and it's a great Hallelujah time and
[2:01:28] we're all excited
[2:01:31] and I wonder if God would cause
[2:01:35] your aortic thing there to
[2:01:40] split get trash foot cut your legs off
[2:01:45] fingers wonder if that's being used of
[2:01:48] God
[2:01:50] [Music]
[2:01:51] come on what a
[2:01:54] testimony the greatest trial of this
[2:01:56] man's life is going to turn into the
[2:01:59] greatest blessing for you and I when we
[2:02:01] hear of his
[2:02:04] testimony because we realize that what
[2:02:06] God has brought somebody else through he
[2:02:09] will also bring us through things
[2:02:12] amen I wonder if being used of
[2:02:15] God would cause us to I don't know be
[2:02:21] used of
[2:02:25] people that God would cause us but to
[2:02:28] pray for our very
[2:02:30] enemies the very people that are coming
[2:02:33] against you maybe family members
[2:02:35] children whatever it may be and you see
[2:02:38] it as a trial in your
[2:02:40] life but yet you're being used of
[2:02:44] God and when you're being used of God
[2:02:47] what's happening the word is being made
[2:02:50] [Music]
[2:02:53] flesh I wonder if being used of God
[2:02:55] means that you give grace and mercy
[2:02:58] words not
[2:03:00] deserved I wonder if being used of God
[2:03:02] means having patience for your brother
[2:03:05] whenever your patience is running out
[2:03:07] for
[2:03:08] him what is it it's the word being made
[2:03:16] flesh I wonder how many times in our
[2:03:18] lives
[2:03:20] lives that we have seen a trial and a
[2:03:24] tribulation and we've been
[2:03:26] tempted because we we bypassed or
[2:03:29] theophany and we've come to this flesh
[2:03:31] man to be tempted and we've been tempted
[2:03:33] by
[2:03:34] things where it be Financial family
[2:03:38] whatever the issues may
[2:03:40] be at some point we're all going to go
[2:03:42] through the same
[2:03:44] issues just some might be more severe
[2:03:46] than others but I wonder in that time of
[2:03:50] diversity in our
[2:03:52] lives is that really God speaking to us
[2:03:56] and saying now is your time to be the
[2:04:00] word made
[2:04:02] flesh this is your time for the seed
[2:04:05] word that I pregnated you with to make
[2:04:08] itself manifested amongst the people and
[2:04:11] Lou youa amongst the people in your
[2:04:14] family amongst the people at your work
[2:04:17] amongst the people at school where ever
[2:04:19] it may be this is your
[2:04:22] time but how's your
[2:04:25] reaction to what's happening in your
[2:04:29] life I want us to be very
[2:04:32] [Applause]
[2:04:35] aware that don't get being used of God
[2:04:38] put in a
[2:04:41] box
[2:04:42] where it just happens at church it just
[2:04:46] happens at the youth meeting it just
[2:04:48] happens the when you serve people no
[2:04:52] sometimes being used of God and the word
[2:04:55] becoming flesh is the time of the
[2:04:58] greatest turmoil in your life beautiful
[2:05:03] why because people are
[2:05:05] watching and they're watching our
[2:05:07] attitudes and they're watching how we
[2:05:09] deal with it and when they see how we've
[2:05:12] came through it though it may not have
[2:05:14] been
[2:05:16] nice though it may not have been joyful
[2:05:19] at the time but when we come out the
[2:05:21] other side we realize that God now was
[2:05:25] working this all together for his good
[2:05:29] according to the thoughts that he had
[2:05:32] within his
[2:05:33] mind
[2:05:36] hallelujah it's something to think
[2:05:39] about so this week as we go through the
[2:05:43] week be aware of what's happening in
[2:05:45] your life
[2:05:47] right be be aware of the
[2:05:49] circumstances be aware of the people
[2:05:52] that God places in your
[2:05:55] path be acutely aware of who God brings
[2:06:00] by your
[2:06:01] feet because perhaps God is going to use
[2:06:05] you no matter how they act or speak to
[2:06:08] you or no matter what the circumstance
[2:06:10] may be perhaps God is using that
[2:06:14] time to make himself manifested yeah
[2:06:18] that he still has Sons and Daughters
[2:06:21] upon this Earth who will stand by the
[2:06:24] word who have been born of the word who
[2:06:27] have been pregnated by the word and who
[2:06:30] are bringing the word to pass in their
[2:06:32] lives God bless you let's Stand
[2:06:35] [Music]
[2:06:36] Together amen let's all pray father Lord
[2:06:41] I Thank you for this very simple thought
[2:06:44] and Lord it no doubt is things that we
[2:06:47] have all heard before Lord and that we
[2:06:51] all know but Apostle pet Peter said that
[2:06:55] if you want to be a faithful Minister if
[2:06:58] you want to be a good Minister put them
[2:07:01] in remembrance of these things and so
[2:07:04] that's what we've done this morning Lord
[2:07:06] and I pray that you would let our
[2:07:09] Spirits be sensitized father to the
[2:07:12] moving of your spirit in our lives Lord
[2:07:15] that we might
[2:07:17] recognize our time to be the word made
[2:07:22] flesh father God I just love you with
[2:07:26] all of my heart and and these people
[2:07:29] that are before you father God they are
[2:07:32] your children and I pray that you will
[2:07:35] deal with each and everyone according uh
[2:07:40] Lord to to how they need to be treated
[2:07:43] Lord you know what they
