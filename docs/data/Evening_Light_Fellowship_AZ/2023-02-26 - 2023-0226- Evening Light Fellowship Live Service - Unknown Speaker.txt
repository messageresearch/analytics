and amen God's a way maker amen amen I just kind of been on my heart since I come back after my accident they're going home on a Monday morning a week or so ago and uh some people are asking you know and I just wanna say that the more I thought about it I knew it was a that the Lord held his hand upon me I mean I wasn't even supposed to take that little truck but I was doing a a favor I didn't I didn't want somebody else to have to drive another car that they're not used to on 93 so I told Israel I'll just take it you know we're selling it I mean so the most the biggest thing that after I got through with it is that the seat belt never worked when I went to take off in the morning there at the house and where's Israel has it been like that or what I mean I don't ever remember it not working I mean and I was jerking on that thing and it just held and held and held and I'm all right so then I get in go take off down the road I thought maybe I stopped and opened the door and it'll and it didn't it's still as hell but you know okay let's be honest how many were turned around and went and parked it and said well you know I'll get it fixed and then I'll go no you know and I'm not saying that's not wasn't the right thing to do but you know what God knows all things and uh so right there it was after I thought about that and when I hit that hit that bull party doing about I just passed the car perfect spot that's where we do it right there in the Bridle Creek boom boom I was almost off the end of the cutoff and uh come up over the other side about halfway down that it just it was there black bull black pavement overcast sky I didn't have time to hit my brakes hit it probably 60 65. and that the more I thought about even later you know I really didn't even feel the impact of the bag or whatever I mean I didn't have no bruising I've seen people after that them bags explode so there was no seat belt you know I was speeding yeah and uh but I don't you know I don't know what it means all I know is that you know what I I was there I'm able to talk about it you know I told I told Monica and you know she's like yeah we only had liabilities did you ever seen sixty five hundred dollars fly away you know she's telling her boss and I'm thinking you know you could you could have been planning a funeral and I even told that to the insurance agent you know because I only had liability this and I said yeah but you know what I could tell my wife they could be planning a funeral for me you know and all I know just God stayed his hand upon me I come out with a little knuckle buster right here on the hand I think my hands flew up hit the windshield and it was bleeding a little bit and that was it was stiff you know when I talked it and I'll finish with this I talked to a cousin back in Arkansas because we just got back and she was telling me when she was a kid one of her cousins was up in Texas I think it was on a country road went through a swinging gate and they weren't even going that fast they hit a cow and it killed her cousin I mean you know we just don't know and so I just wanted to give that test more that you know what God still stays his hand you know Israel says text me later he's like still trying to figure out that's just bizarre how this ice is I'm gonna cut my losses I says because I don't want to go back and try to do that in the Audi you know something that big party wouldn't and I would have had Monica with me on that side so all I know is he's here [Music] let's pray father we we humbly tumbly for you Lord Lord you know all

testimony in fact I've told you for many years now that we saw a great moving of the holy spirit in Germany God gave me a vision one day and I stepped into that Vision I had told Sandy about it and it was at a youth meeting in Northern Germany and there was a young man there I didn't know the wise in where for us and who's what and and they were it was our some of our first youth meetings in Germany but God had told me and showed me in a vision that I I was to point to this one man that was in the congregation and tell him to stand up and say that he loves the Lord now this was a young Rebel Rouser he was a young boy of the local Elder who invited us to the meetings been to church raised in the message raised around it but he didn't know if it was for him and he says God I need a sign I may believe God can give you a sign he said father I need you to give me a sign otherwise I'm done never go to church again I'm done I I need you to give me a sign and that sign is going to be that brother Ron calls me out and tells me to stand up and according to the vision that's exactly what I did I didn't know him I I said young man stand up I said stand up and say you love the Lord and these four girls that were sitting on the front row they turned around to see who it is and when they saw it they thought oh did this pastor ever blow it he's the worst one in the sanctuary but God knows what he's doing he asked God he prayed all night I need a sign have him to call me out and guess what we called him out and he started giving his testimony there in German and when he did the Holy Spirit just broke boom and he is a fine young man grown up to be a fine young man a pastor in Northern Germany I look forward to him coming and and being here with us you all will enjoy his

Sandy I just need to relax I I got to lay down and I did and just all of the emotions and coming home and etc etc and I got up I woke up this morning 2 A.M the Lord put this on my heart so uh it's fresh come right out of the oven how many of you are ready say I'm ready all right Matthew chapter 25 verses 1 through 13. Matthew chapter 25. verses 1 through 13. then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took no took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lambs while the bridegroom tiri they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry mate behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him and all the virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut and afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us and he answered and said verily verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for you know not for you know neither the day nor the hour were in the son of man cometh turn with me one more scripture book of Acts chapter 2. Acts chapter 2 verses 12 through 21. and they were all amazed and were endowed saying one to another would meaneth this others mocking said these men are of are full of new wine but Peter's standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice instead of them you men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Jewel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall seek visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my hand maidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in Heaven above and the signs in the earth beneath them blood and Fire and Vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the Lord and it shall come to pass and whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved thus God's word is read and we ask a blessing upon it may God bless the reading of his word now to all of your hearts you may be seated now in the presence of God I would like to title my sermon this morning The Awakening of the wise and the foolish virgins I don't want to take a subject this morning of give us of your oil no you remember how I preached my last sermon on the wave Sheaf waved over elaudiusia and we know that Peter became the spokesperson of that day being filled with the Holy Ghost he stood up and began to tell these men because they said men and Brethren what must we do to be saved and Peter became the spokesperson on that day and he identified what God was doing in their midst and he took a modern-day event and applied it to scripture and he said this is that that was spoken this is the manifestation of what the prophet Joel said would come to pass Pentecost came after the wave sheep have been cut down and the wave sheep was the first one that came to maturity he was waived over the congregation seven times to show the rest of the field what they shall become now we all know that according to the gospel of brother Branham he said America rejected the gospel in 1956. he said she came up to a time he called it kadish barnia here the prophet was ready he had a word he was there he even was preaching in Azusa Street where in 1906 the Revival began in this last end time of the last Church age and he preaches his sermon return in Jubilee and he was giving them an admonishment let's go on let's take the land it's a good land flowing with milk and honey let us take the promises of God and go forward and they refused to cross over and he said America as a nation rejected the gospel 1956 he said Ichabod is written on the wall and he said judgment is going to strike America now we see America falling apart we see it it just coming apart at the seams we wonder and even as I spoke with the Brethren from overseas they said it is it is hard to imagine the change that is happening in America today how the people's minds how the government how the how everything seems to just be falling apart and we know that our prophet he preached the sermon the world falling apart and really when he spoke it Watch God's word when he speaks it it begins to come to pass he started all this he said the world is falling apart no the leadership of the word had been rejected and yes seven years after the revealing of the son of man comes to pass you have the opening of The Seven Seals brother Brown says in it is the rising of the sun remember there's only one sermon brother Brennan speaks eight times about the wave Sheaf and that is in the rising of the Sun he is the one that opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was opened what is the opening of them seals then revealing Christ and very seven angels which represented the seven Church ages all completed and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us and there he is standing there Supreme judge showing that he is half an Omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power did that to us quickening power lets us see his coming quickening power snatches from Death To Life quickening power gives discernment to know what's wrong with you and what to do what you have done and what you ought to not have done and what you should have done and what you will be quickening power all these things you cannot crucify Christ again unless he is here in some form in order to be crucified two thousand years ago the Jewish people and the the laity of that day crucified Christ that happened at the beginning of the Gentile dispensation and now it's happened again at the end of the Gentile dispensation brother Brenham said in the sermon the indictment as Peter said your denominational fathers Peter indicted you by the said which of your fathers hasn't done this Stephen done the same thing with Wicked hands you've crucified the Prince of Life Jesus didn't say himself which one of your fathers didn't put the prophets in the tombs and you garnish them afterwards so it has been the righteous man down Through the Ages and so I indict this High polished church-going bunch of Christ rejecting people of this day you with your forms of godliness Crucify My crisis second time by telling the people these words are for some other day it isn't for this day I indict you you're guilty of the same crime that they was on the day of the crucifixion repent and turn to God or perish now just lately I want to bring some Modern events that is happening here in America today to your attention have any of you heard of a Revival that's happening on Asbury College campus the prophet talks about Asbury 53 times did you know that Ormond Neville went to the college there he was a Methodist that got converted and got the Holy Ghost now let me just show you because I want to tie in what's going on right now and the world is looking at it wondering wow what is happening show you a few quotes I will restore in 1953 in Owensboro Kentucky and that fire was he had for a while through the Dark Ages but the first one that saw the pillar of fire was Martin Luther he sounded the Trump and come out of the Catholic church and the first saying you know it caused a great Universal Revival all right then the next one you know Martin Luther got to organize and he organized down so tight until the pillar of fire moved again but Luther couldn't go because he was organized and full of bunch of Doctrine but the pillar of fire moved just the same John Wesley saw it in England and away he went justification the Luther preached by faith and the first thing you know Wesley saw sanctification through the blood and away he went believing it and the first thing you know a great Revival saved England and America when him and Asbury and all of them come here to America great Revival swept the land the pillar of fire moved that's where you get the name of the college was this brother Asbury it is founded because of the Revival it had taken place there when he and John Wesley came over and preached to that group of people 1954 brother brennaman picking up again you methodists used to have Divine Healing power of God shouting well right here when Asbury and them come to America I'm speaking to some of you students you hear it Asbury here this morning see what I'm speaking of when Asbury your founder first come here and some of you dignified people to these methodists and Baptist Churches so forth when they first got uh come here the Methodist was called holy ruler Holy Rollers that's where you got your background so let me just tell you a little bit more about what's happening in Asbury College now I haven't been around Kentucky much uh but I was there with Charlie Cox and I looked on Google and I said how far is it away from Jeffersonville to Asbury College it says it's 81 miles from Jeffersonville it's about an hour and 25 minute drive brother Branham actually says I'll probably send both of my daughters to Asbury College I would like to go them go there he said it was quite a reputable college at that time in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever in Campbellsville Kentucky 1955 he says brother Neville and after all some of you people here brother Neville happens to be a Methodist preacher out of I believe from Asbury wasn't that right brother from Asbury College how many ever heard Asbury College oh my that's a wonderful place it's right across out of my backyard see it's a marvelous place which I live close enough to send my children there to grow up broken cisterns I'm doing this for purpose just bear with me for a moment broken cisterns 1965. then God raised up John Wesley with sanctification the message the message of the second work of Grace and it was a wonderful thing but after Wesley and Asbury they organized it died then then come up the Pentecostals with the restoration the gifts they were doing fine what happened organized it and it died just exactly now in the midst of all of this God is still calling out a Remnant out of every one of those Generations remnant he's calling out a Remnant and may I say this I'm believing right now that what this move that is happening right now is calling remnant not bride remnant he certainly is and it's our time of coming out of gathering together and that's what I think the Full Gospel businessman has played a great part in breaking down these walls and saying there is no difference in us let us come together and worship God under one principle not under an organization if it was an organization I'd get off this platform right now as I have nothing to do with it brother Branham said I love the people in the denominations it's the system I'm against the Asbury College right now is experiencing a Revival that started on their Chapel campus I wonder what it this is all about why they're crying out for a Revival and a baptism of the Holy Ghost understand this that when the foolish virgin realize that they need oil that's the very hour the bridegroom comes mark of the beast 1961. and remember the very time that the sleeping virgin went to buy oil that's when the bridegroom came Glory don't you see it if the Presbyterians and the episcopalians and these others are coming seeking for the Holy Ghost you better get your lamp trimmed trimmed yes it needs trimming Pentecost better be trimming some lamps hallelujah amen get a lot of the world cut away from you you done got corroded over the Wicks gotta got in bad shape you know that Wick is a great thing I used to watch where the real Wick of God is a Believer is a wick look he's got fire on one end and uh the other ants dipped into oil drawing oil making fire what a church what a power what a place to be Hallelujah shining that same Gospel Light that shines in the East is shining in the West it shall be light in the evening time rise trim your lamp Pentecost trim off the world trim off the fashion of the world trim off the things of the world get ready the hour is at hand how many of you believe that now he said this in 1961. I say how much closer are we now I can say that to a bunch of message Believers today it's lamp trimming time it's time to be ready I believe that God is doing a move among his bride around the world this is not orchestration of man it is an orchestration of the Holy Spirit men are getting into the word of God and seeing things they have never seen before Jesus said the time will come when I wanted to tell you of these things but seeing you could not bear them now how be it after I'm gone you're going to begin to catch these things you'll begin to understand these Parables and things my brother my sister this is the day for us to understand this message and The Parables and the mysteries of God it is it belongs to us it is our inheritance how much longer do we have I believe right now we are very quickly closing the Gentile dispensation it's a time now that the youth they call this this is what they are calling it the Woodstock of the new generation young people that are sick and tired of religion of lighting candles and saying prayers and just being religious they want something real and I can say to each and every one of you God is real and don't you dare make him some form of creed and dogma and of a religious way huh we need God to come on the scene what he's real I know he's real having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof the Bible says from such turn away God give us something real and the sermon only believe watch brother Branham go after this 1961. I'm going to say it because it's on tape our brother can hear it if he wants to get this tape Kernan concerning Brother David duplicy my precious brother and friend I got a letter of criticism from him and I didn't want to read it secretary got it and I didn't want to read it because it I withheld saying his name on a tape but this is taped the tapes are going here's exactly what I said I was preaching on the Nearing of the coming of Christ and Brother David is dealing with the presbyterian's Methodist Baptists and those great men that is his ministry to them God has sent him with a Ministry David is a smart Theologian scholar and wonderful man of God he's been with me in the meetings he stood by my side I love him as an only brother could love another and that is true and I said about David and the church will bear me witness I said it seems like Brother David as spiritual as he is would wake up to the fact to know he's dealing with sleeping virgin and the Pentecostal people are so glad to see the Presbyterians writing in a little declaration we got to go back and watch this we got to go back to Divine Healers we got to go back to speaking in tongues you read the piece where they put out we got to go back and have healing Services Billy Graham talking got to go back to Pentecost do you realize brother that the very hour that they went to wake the sleeping virgin up when she come to buy oil that's when Jesus came oh God help us to recognize the lateness of this hour the prophet of God was making his church in the message Believers to actually you be aware of what was happening even among denomination taking modern events looking at the news reading the paper then he preached the anointed ones at the end time in 1962 he preaches unbelief does not hinder God when you see the methodists and the Baptists and Presbyterians and so forth seeking after the Holy Ghost be careful that's the hour when the sleeping virgin began to come and they said give us of your oil now you got to get it the same way where we got it and when they went after it it was the very hour the bridegroom came and the bride was taken in and they were left out and there was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth I wonder if my Pentecostal people have their eyes open to such as that to realize right at the verge of his appearing just at any time nothing else left I have a couple short little videos I normally don't do this but I I decided to go ahead and take from the news that is happening now to let you hear what they say firsthand witness of it now they are quoting habakkuk as the Old Testament habakkuk chapter 1 verse 5. behold ye among the Heathen and regard and wonder marvelously for I will work a work in your days which he will not believe though it be told you this is the central theme that God is doing a work among them February 8th is when this revival began to start if you remember February 8th here at this church we played the tape the debate on tongues Wednesday let me share with you just a few comments before you I show you some videos says the Revival I'm quoting them directly from a witness that was there it began at a chapel service on February 8th Zach mere cribs the assistant soccer coach who is also the leader leadership development coordinator for the missions organization envision he preached about becoming love in action his text was Romans chapter 12. as he started mere Krebs told the students you were required to attend three chapels per week that he wasn't aiming to entertain them and he didn't want them to focus on him I hope you guys forget me but anything but the Holy Spirit and God's word would be fertile ground in your hearts and produce fruit Romans 12 the only star is him God's word in Jesus and the Holy Spirit moving in our midst that's what we're hoping for mere Krebs also talked to them about the experience of God's love in contrast to radically poor love that narcissistic and abusive manipulative and selfish some of you guys have experienced that loving Church he said and maybe it's not violent maybe it's not male molestation it's not taken advantage of but it feels like someone has pulled a fast one on you no one came forward at the end of the service a mirror crab was convinced he totally whiffed it he texted his wife latest stinker I'll be home soon then a black gospel Trio sang a final song in the Chapel ended in about 18 or 20 students 19 students stayed they sat in clusters a few in our seats a few on the floor in the aisle a few in the front of the stage they kept praying and Zeke atha a Junior told the documentarian a few days later that he was one of the ones who remained in the chapel he left after an hour to go to a class but then when he got out he heard singing I said okay that's weird I went back up and it was surreal the piece that was in the room was unexplainable he and a few friends immediately left sprinting across campus bursting in the classroom and announcing the Revival is happening my goodness the Wesleyan movement school has a tradition of revivals and a theology that teaches people to wait and watch for divined wind to blow the university is named for Francis Asbury the early American Methodist Bishop who encouraged and celebrated revivals from Maine to Georgia and Maryland to Tennessee there are also people in Kentucky community who have long prayed for fresh Revival at the school including a Malaysian Theologian teacher who sometimes walked up and down the streets with a cardboard sign and said holy spirit you are welcome here administrators however did not immediately assume a Revival was starting even as young men ran around campus shouting it was only a spontaneous prayer service stretched into the afternoon and then evening did eat did official school officials realize they might have a decision to make and how to respond let me tell you when God moves he don't need your help on the day of Pentecost the Bible says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come and they all became in one mind in one Accord and it says and the pillar of fire came down and tongues of fire set upon each one of them what were they doing City God don't need your help if he's God amen he don't need the organ and a piano we don't need to work it up by emotion you know what God is God now if the Brethren are ready with the cup okay they're ready turn the volume up here I don't know if it shows the little video clip at the beginning here is Tucker Carlson foreign turn it up reports that people are flying in from Singapore New Zealand to join whatever this is and so we thought it'd be worth finding out what is it Allison for fader is the student body president as per University and she joins us and Allison you're so nice to come on thank you what it what is this do you think right what is this that's what I mean that's the question right and um a theme or a Bible verse that we've all been sharing with each other I said Back At One and the Lord says look at the Nations and watch for I'm doing something in your day that you wouldn't believe if you were told and it's happening and we can hardly believe it well it seems remarkable I mean so many stories you see them and you think that's very different I'm not quite sure what it means but it's worth learning more so my understanding is this began in a completely conventional service and a boy got up and started talking about his own flaws and then it just something changed in the atmosphere and it never ended is that fair that's completely what happened um so here at Asbury University three mornings a week we have Chapel at 10 A.M sharp the whole student body gets together and we we sing praise to the Lord and we hear a message from a speaker and for seemingly no reason at first on on Wednesday February 8th it didn't end and that's that's kind of the logistical side of what's been going on and then you know on the on the deeper side of things what's been happening here since Wednesday is there's a there's a young Army of believers who are rising to claim Christianity the faith as their own as a Young Generation and as a free generation and that's why people can't get enough it's amazing so you felt like something like this was going to happen because everything finds equilibrium I think who are the people who are coming where are they coming from um we don't know most of them um we've obviously been getting calls hundreds of calls to the university switchboard number but we have friends here from Brazil from Indonesia um almost every state um and and they just keep coming and and it's no wonder you know and it's like you said I mean especially in the midst of tragedies like what we've seen in Michigan State University and and even farther back to 2020 especially Our Generation was impacted so much and so you have to wonder you know what's going to break and in this case the holy the Holy Spirit has interceded for us here at Asbury and and Across the Nation I assume you don't know how long this will continue I could not tell you and I wouldn't wouldn't want to guess Allison thank you great to see you appreciate it thank you really thank you I appreciate you having me on she made the comment there is a young Army of young people rising up taking God at his word let's listen to the next one [Music] Church attendance in general has gone down particularly amongst the millennial generation I think many Millennials are leaving the church because they don't feel like the church is relevant or meets their felt needs the percent of Americans who identify with any religion has been on the decline for decades the biggest generational drop-off is with millennials well maybe that's the case for organized religion but maybe the conclusion is a little simplistic because we're seeing something interesting happening on college campuses across the country it started on February 8th at Asbury University in Kentucky Chapel Services started that morning and then they didn't end for 13 days 50 000 people flocked to the small town to experience the Asbury Revival and that ended up spawning Marathon worship Services all over including at Cedarville University in Ohio where my next guest played piano for six hours straight joining me now is lalitha Gaddy she's a student at Cedarville University lalitha um this started at your school about a week ago and it's still happening I mean this is wild what what's going on here explain it to our audience yeah thank you so much for having me on the show Laura um God is definitely at work at Cedarville and it's been absolutely amazing to see because we see students worshiping we see students praying we see students praying through scripture specifically we see students repenting of their sins and turning to Christ then So Beautiful to see now Oliver is there a sense that the world itself when we see it in many ways coming apart at the seams the attack on on traditional families the gender bending the culture you know a lot of people think is pretty depraved um and in is it drugs and all everything I think for young people today there's so much pressure on young people in social media do people are now people seeking a you know refuge in in in scripture in a consistency in the Almighty I think I think that hope can only be found in Christ and that's what we're seeing here at Cedarville because like um a lot of times people turn to all those things that you mentioned as a way to escape their reality but I think hope can only be found in the work of Christ on the cross and that's what we're seeing here we see people putting their faith in Christ and turning away from their sins and it has been absolutely wonderful to see now are people coming to the Revival who maybe were skeptical doubters not weren't sure they believed and have you seen personal transformation along the way yeah I think even in my own life it has made me a lot more cognizant of the fact that eternity matters and that we are living for something that's so much more than just the here and now and every single one of our decisions impacts that and it has just made me want to live a life that is more worthy because the Bible tells us that it talks about returning to our first love and I think that's what we're seeing I'm not sure if I would call it a Revival yet but I think we'll know based on the fruits because it's not going to stop here this is something that we need to see in neighborhoods all across America it's not confined to Cedarville in any way or Asbury or anywhere else the same Holy Spirit that's here is at work this is awesome it's so great to get away from politics into something that really really matters thank you for joining us tonight [Applause] you can take God off of the money you can take God out of our courtrooms you can forbid prayer in our classrooms and on our campuses but guess what he's got it all in control and when they think they've got him out guess what he comes in and right among the college students in the places of higher education in the tree of knowledge in the midst of Satan's Eden guess what God is doing saying return back to your first love in Matthew 5 verses 43 4 through 48 and ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good with sendeth Reign on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye AST do not the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect I have learned something just recently to love with a Godly love to not judge anyone to have a love that would forgive amen brother random said if you want to make Heaven your home you must have perfect love oh we work on the Creeds and the dogmas and this and that and so much of the time we miss the very thing that's most important hereby know that you shall be my disciples that you have love one for another we have to have everybody agree with us or we don't love them we exclude them shame on us I don't care if you see it the way I see it that's okay I still gonna love you um I remember David Wilkerson when he went to the streets where the gangs were at and God had sent him and there you remember the the book The Crossing the switchblade he had a gang member and he came up there and said David Wilkerson you have the audacity to come down here and try to preach us to gang members and thieves and robbers and everything and I'm going to cut you up into every little tiny piece that I can possibly do and David Wilkerson said these words he said and when you do every piece will Echo back I love you God help me to love love with a a godlier when the prophet went to Green's Mill and he was asking God about what about this anointing that seems to be falling here and there and how is it that this anointing is falling on all of the churches and people and God I don't understand it and remember and I'm going to give you the quote then I'll go to the scripture but in the seed of discrepancy preached here in Phoenix he said I had God in the dusty cave in one afternoon I walked out laid my Bible on a log and it bloated open to Hebrews the sixth chapter which said in the last days how it be if we fell away from the truth and renewed ourselves again under repentance there was no more sacrifice for sin and that thorns and thistles which was nigh under rejection whose end is to be burned but the rain cometh upon the Earth often to water and to dress it but the thorns and thistles would be rejected but the wheat would be gathered and I thought well it's just the wind happened to blow that open well I just laid the Bible down again I thought well now I'll just and here comes the wind bloated open it happened three times then I raised up and I thought Lord why would you open that Bible for me to read that and when I get down to that thorns and thistles which is nine to rejection is in to be burned I thought why would you open that to me there he reads on now these real Visions come without pulling it into any gear that's just God see and I looked and I seen an earth it was turning out in front of me and I've seen it all disked there was a man dressed in white went around sowing wheat and after he went around the scripture or the Earth around come a man looked horrible and he was dressed in black and he was throwing weed seeds all over it they both came up together and when they did they both were thirsty because the rain was needed and each one looked like it was prey a little head bent over lord Send the Rain send the rain and the great clouds come up the rain fell upon both of them when it did the little wheat jumped up began to say praise the Lord praise the Lord and the little weed jumped up right on the same sign said praise the Lord praise the Lord the vision was interpreted the rain falls on the just and the unjust The Same Spirit can fall in a meeting and everybody rejoicing it Hypocrites Christians and all together exactly right but what is it by their fruits you shall know them I think we live in a timely age when these things should be preached and talked about I do believe that this move is a genuine move of the Holy Ghost anointing because they're seeking more of God and whenever people go to seeking more of God there is more of God to be found because these young people have heard so much and seen so much and experienced so much that they doubt is God real so God is once again reaching out by his holy presence making himself known see they want a genuine move of God in their midst they've tried Church religion they've tried Christianity with no power you see I believe now as I say this in closing that the Terrors are being bound first that's what the Bible said and the Seal of Christ 1955 musicians if you come I got just a couple quotes here God is our Eternal judge whether you have the Holy Spirit or not no one can judge you God Alone but we have a sign that says by their fruits you shall know them not by their Church affiliation but by their fruits you shall know them nowhere in the Bible does it say that affiliation with church is a sign no we're in the Bible does it say shouting is a sign nowhere in the Bible does it say speaking in tongues is a sign nowhere in the Bible does it say Healing The Sick is a sign the sign of the Believers the fruits of the spirit and the fruits of the spirit is not seeing visions not Healing The Sick not speaking with tongues not shouting the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience amen that's the Seal of God that may sound a little flat-footed but we're going on down the Old Testament in a few minutes bring it out in the new and find out it isn't just right that's the true brother if you get back on the right foot and get started God will shake this nation with a Revival [Music] but you got to get back to God lay aside every weight of the sin that does so easily beset you and run with patience the race leadership 65. he put a over seed in a wheat seed in the same bed and pour water down upon them and anoint them they'll both rejoice they'll both grow by it same water The Sun Shines on the just and the unjust the rain falls in the just and the unjust but by their fruits you shall know them how can you keep from lining up with the word amen see what I mean the water falls on the just and the injust ice anointed I'm not just wanting an anointing or some feel good experience because the anointing of the holy spirit is to come and to Quicken that seed inside of you and reveal the word to you that you would live a life that is pleasing to him what we're seeing right now it it amazes me my grandsons listen to what's happening on these college campuses they're saying hey we we don't want just some religion we don't want Church entity we don't want this we don't want lighten candles and saying prayers I want to know is he real and if you will ask God show thyself I need to know you he will but he don't clown and he don't for nobody if you really mean it he will show himself to you because he's God one last quote here brother Brahm said in recognizing your day in its message everywhere now there's no Revival everybody's complaining ministers crying I've read one of the outstanding papers that comes here to the church a very fine paper I know the editor I know the people and they're godly people very fine brother and sister more The Herald of his coming one of the finest papers on the field Harold love is coming they hardly will print anything unless it's about fast pray fast pray sound a trumpet how many reads it you know you see it all the time fast pray fast pray it's all you hear fast prayer is going to have a great breaking of the day there's a great thing going to happen all of you pray pray pray we're not too late yet why do they do that why do they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing there will be a great there will be Awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they've not recognized The Awakening of the Bride talk about a woke generation the only ones who are woke enough to see the falseness of the woke generation is the bride amen by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you amen here we are in the midst of the end of the Gentile dispensation the End of the lotusian Age and something is happening among denomination and uh among liberals and kids with long hair colored earies tattoos all of the confusion that is correct that has absolutely gathered around them they are victims of the social media and have all of this liberalism and all they want is life and the only life is Christ can you say Amen to that people are looking to drugs movies sex all kinds of things when really he says come unto me ye all ye that are weary and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you for my yoke is easy and my burden is light I'm so glad that I know him sometimes when I become so burdened and I feel like I'm being crushed and there's a heavy weight upon me I say father help me you said you'd be with me and he comes and you know according to that poem he said in that hard time he said I seen the footprints of you and Christ walking together but when we came to the real hard times there's only one set of footprints did you leave me then was I walking through the valley of the shadow of death and you left me is that what you did why only one set of footprints he said my son those are not yours they're mine that's when I carried you that's what he's doing with me right now he's carrying me I've tried to be a good father I failed I've tried to be a good pastor I failed I've tried to do so many things and I I admit to all of you if there's anything I've ever done that was good it was because of him because I myself am a failure I need him more than I've ever needed him and if God would just bear me up right now I'd like to play sister Jill that song he's got it all in control maybe you feel burdened this morning and you're like me saying man sometimes I can't seem to catch my breath I don't seem to find that place where I can get away oh David said if I had the wings of a dove I'd fly away and be at rest how many of you have ever felt like oh God Let Me Fly Away how many of you have ever said maybe in the privacy of your own prayer closet it's okay God take me home if I don't wake up in the morning that's okay how many of you believe that he can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity would you envision him right now with this arms outstretched saying come unto me I'll give you rest if you need rest this morning why don't you do that right now why don't you respond [Music] I can't handle it I'm being crushed Claudia see you the spirit of this age and denomination and all of this and oh come

you my faults my failures [Music] you know what's an amazing thing is God commendeth his love towards us that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us it's not because of how good you are how good you keep the Commandments because Jesus said he that's guilty of one part is guilty of all which one of us have are not totally guilty then I want to say just like that one woe is me I am a man of unclean left side dwell among unclean people [Music] I am not resting upon my own righteousness I'm resting upon the righteousness of God that he gave to me and I accept it by faith in Jesus Christ and he is my Lord and Savior therefore I can say he's got it all in control amen if you're burdened right now let it go [Music] let go and let God [Music] you will never know if you can walk on water

life in his hands every road I walk down I put my life in his hand heavenly father I thank you Lord that we have such a confidence in you that when our world seems to be falling apart and things seem to want to crush us on all sides but father You Can Be Touched by the feeling of our infirmity therefore father even before I cry out you know even before I make it known you know but it takes my saying Lord with the confession of my own lips though God slay me yet will I trust him though Things Fall Apart around me I will trust him I have confidence in God not in myself not in this world not in this this system that we live down here but I trust in the system that is to come father soon and very soon you're coming we can see this thing that's happening out right now at Asbury and people

their lives would change I pray o God of those that are among them move in their midst of God let the women see what they've done wrong the young men let them repent I pray o God each and every one of God they feel your presence but we don't want to feel your presence we want to live a life that is pleasing to you and to please you without faith the Bible says it's impossible to please you therefore father I pray move upon them by faith let them rise up o God we know the hours late and the last one this is not a time to play this is not a time to get out from behind the word it is a
