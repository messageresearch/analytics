to Exodus Exodus 14 we're going to go to 1 Timothy 6 and we'll come back to this so keep your Bibles marked in Exodus 14 and we'll read uh verse 13 and Moses said unto the people FY not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show unto you today for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today ye shall not see them again no more forever am the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace now let's go over to 1 Timothy 6 and12 and it says fight the good fight of Faith as brother menow was singing set your wings on the Winds of Faith that's right lay hold on eternal life where unto th are also called and H has professed a good Prof confession before many witnesses you can have your seats this evening in the presence of the Lord and for a a title this evening I would like to take the title of the Lord shall fight for you the Lord shall fight for you and for a a subject here of staying in the fight staying in the fight you see we're called to a battle and we can many times as we get into this Warfare that we're fighting it's not against Earthly and but it's a Heavenly and it's a spiritual warfare that we're in battle with and there no as as we go in this journey we can be weary in well-doing we can be weary in battle you can be battle weary things can get hard and tough but let me encourage you this evening to stay in the fight from the youngest to the oldest no matter how old you are stay in the [Applause] fight sir this battle that we're called to it's worth fighting for that's right the things that you're fighting for is worth fighting for amen and as we have started this new year and we're already a weekend and time is just going to keep going by and you know as I begin to look and you know even for myself I I I set some personal goals and you know brother Brandon would talk about resolutions and stuff and but you know personal goals are good for you am amen because personal goals and goals for you and goals for your family and what God's going to do in your life and your spiritual walk it keeps you on track and you know you see and I begin to look up the statistics of of New Year's resolutions let's call it our goals and within the F within the first week within this first week of of January 23% have already quit their goals they're already done so that leaves only 77% and then you get by the end of January 30 days into the month SE 60 to 95% of people are already going to quit goals that they set it only takes 30 days for men and women and and Humanity just to quit you know what it's too hard things arise in their lives you say well what are you getting at that doesn't sound very spiritual is it how is it going to help me let me tell you it's going to let me show you in your human ability in your human desires and things when things get tough and life gets hard and and and struggles come up what happens we have a tendency to quit we have a tendency to lay down when the battle gets hard what happens we begin to let down right now as Believers we believe that now is the time to fight that's right now is the time to GD up our loins to get ready for the fight to to get the armor that God has given us because the enemy is going to come in like a flood things aren't going to get easier Saints though it's the Turning of a a a calendar year and you know Trump is coming in and the election and people think that's going that's not going what's going to happen it's going to get harder let's go back to if The Exodus 14 and as we pick it up here that Moses is called the people out or God's called the people out under Moses and they're getting into the the Wilderness here and let's look at verse three for Pharaoh will say unto the children of Israel they are entangled in the land and the Wilderness hath shut them in in verse four I will harden Pharaoh's heart look what the Lord's going to do I will harden Pharaoh's heart that he shall follow after them and I will be honored upon pharaoh and upon his host that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord you see God does things he hardens people's hearts why not this wasn't just for the Israelites even though they were pushed out and it would caus them to move but what was God doing he was hardening Pharaoh's heart for that the Egyptians would know that he is God praise God in verse 10 and when Pharaoh Drew nigh listen to the the condition that the the Israelites got in that whenever they were delivered they were happy they were out in the wilderness they were out of slavery but listen in verse 10 and when Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their voices or lifted up their eyes and behold and the Egyptians marched after them and they were so afraid and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord and they said unto Moses because they were no graves in Egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt with us to carry us forth out of Egypt is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt listen saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it has been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we might die in the wilderness isn't that something that he here they were in bondage they were under slavery and yet they say in here it was better for us to live back there back in bondage and if we aren't careful what's happening in L DEA you get comfortable with leoa where we're at and I would rather live under the condition and be cool and and relaxed in my Leo Dean life I would rather live in bondage than move with the spirit of God in verse 13 and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord you see when fear arises upon you when worry Rises upon you when they it feels like the enemy is coming in close upon you what is God telling them stand still that's right stand still too many we times we get busy in the hustle and bustle of life we need to stand still that's right amen amen for the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace in verse 15 he says and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they may go forward let me tell you this evening it's time to go forward it's time to move forward can you receive that this evening it's time to move forward it's time to leave the past behind us absolutely it's time to leave our mistakes and our worries and our fears and everything that held us down in 2024 is the changing of a year let us move forward in God praise the Lord I'm going to get a drink that one was opened unless they open them all and so we see here that we are called under another Exodus and leaving the past behind us when God you know when God calls us he's going to he's going to sustain us he's going to take care of us when God calls us to a battle thank you when God calls us to a battle and God said I'm going to fight for you let me tell you he means what he says and says what he means amen he's going to fight our battles and so we see as they begin to move on and God said I will fight for you hold your peace you're not going to have to lift a hand you're not going to have to lift any any sword to fight this enemy that's coming upon you and so we pick it up in verse 19 and the angel of the Lord went before the camp of Israel and removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud that went before their face stood behind them and it came between them and the Egyptians you see when God he's he has us on this Earthly Exodus and as we're walking many times he's providing a way before us he's going before us and he's opening doors maybe it's a job maybe it's an opportunity maybe it's things in our lives and we see God opening doors in our lives and it's God before us but then he removes himself and then we begin to walk and we stop and we say God where are you but yet he's just changed and he's come behind us because he sees when an enemy is coming in like a flood what is he going to do he's going to raise up a standard so when he's seeing the enemy coming behind him what was happening he moved from before him to behind him what is it God before us God behind us God above us listen God has us surrounded hallelujah amen thank you the rest of that scripture says but it gave light by night to these so that one came not near to the other and it was a cloud of Darkness so on one side listen the Holy Spirit the pillar that was moving it brought Darkness to one it brought judgment to one but what was it doing it was bringing light and Liberty to another praise the Lord and so we see that we can't get complacent we can't get lazy with the cares of life we got to keep moving forward in Deuteronomy 20 and verse one as we see that he he was preparing Israel again for battle and I love this story and even as you begin to read through the Old Testament you see that God he would begin to Israel is a is a typ host you can see it all down through scripture and how it types and as he walks Israel down he would deliver Israel here and they would walk a while and then they would have to fight another battle and God would deliver them and then they would have to fight another battle and so we see here in Deuteronomy 20 and verse one when thou goest out to the battle against thy enemies and seest horses and chariots and the people more than thou be not afraid of them for the Lord thy God is with thee which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and it shall be when ye have come nigh unto the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people and say unto them here oh Israel ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies enemies let not your hearts faint fear not do not tremble neither be ye terrified because of them for the Lord your God is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies Amen to save you what is God doing you see he would bring a peace before the people a priest before the people and he would say prepare for battle what was he doing he was encouraging him he was getting him ready for battle he was making the speech and even as we see natural generals within we can look down through history Great Men of God you can see Great Men of God are natural men you can see Hitler and M musolini and they were pre-tribulation spirits and they could Inspire men with words to do things that's right yeah they did Inspire men with words to do things yeah good and bad we see men that would come and they would give speeches and and you can take George Washington I can only imagine what it would be like when he was at Valley Forge and he had to encourage the men and the men AR wearing shoes and they're half dressed and he had to prepare them for battle what was it like all these Great Men you can take great leaders like George Washington Grant and Lee and Eisen power listen to what Churchill said he says we shall go to the ends we shall fight we shall fight over the seas and over the oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our Island whatever the cost may be we're going to fight on the beaches we're going to fight on the grounds we're going to fight in the fields and we're going to fight in the streets we're going to fight in the hills We Will Never Surrender and even if which I Do Not For a Moment believe this island or a large part of it would become under subjection or starving there's an Empire Beyond the Sea armed and guarded who will carry on the struggle until in God's good time the new world with all the power and might steps forth to rescue and bring a Liberation to the old you see this man he can get so inspired to encourage other men and say we're going to fight we're going to fight on land and we're going to fight in the sea we're going to fight and do whatever we can we're not going to surrender we're not going to give in and we see that he says we're going to fight until when until God let me tell you Mr Churchill God is going to bring a new order he's going to bring a new world and it's going to bring this world into subjection it's going to bring this new world or this old world into a Liberation praise the Lord and so we see that if men could be so inspired to inspire other men to encourage them and to use words that would Inspire them in such a way to go to battle and like I said with Hitler and you can go and see the concentration camps and I've seen them two years ago and you watch walk through those camps and you see how could men treat men like this how can another man treat another man this way and you see and you go through the gas Chambers and you see where they were burning them and you see pictures of bodies piled up and at the time that we were walking through those chambers it was the time that the lead or the the the pollen would begin to blow and there was white fuzz blowing everywhere and they would and there was a person there and they would say that's what it was like when they were burning them and the Ashes coming down so you can just imagine that a man could Inspire another man in such a way and if a man can Inspire another man how much more can the word of God Inspire us who are seeds and Sons and Daughters of God that it's just not a book on paper it's not just words that we're reading it's not just a just a book what is it it's God's eternal promise amen hallelujah that it should be able to inspire Us in such a way that when the Lord says I will fight your battles he's going to fight our battles when he says greater is he that is in you it's greater than he that is in you right it's here to encourage and to uplift and as we see here and I I was just reading in the in the Book of Joshua and brother Russell kind of mentioned it in his prayer that as we see in the book of Josh or in judges sorry in judges and when you begin to rej judges you you see that as they begin to soour through many men God would rise up and they would do the things of the Lord and then they would fall and they would do evil in the sight of God and then another man would be inspired and he would rise up and then they would do evil in the sight of God and so we see in Josh here here in judges 2 and 6 and he says and when Joshua had let the people go the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land and the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua who had seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel and Joshua the son of none and the servant of the Lord died being being 110 years old and they buried him in the borders of his in inheritance in Timothy timoth heras in the Mount of Ephraim on the north side of the hill of gash and also all the generations were gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet The Works which he had done for Israel why there was a generation that Rose after him there was a generation of that walked with Joshua and they seen the the the walls come down and and as Joshua spoke as for me and my house we're going to serve the Lord and I can see that he would Inspire those men that were around him he would encourage those men and what did he do Joshua he brought those men up to that standard yes but yet there was a generation after them that knew not the Lord or the works of the Lord and as I began and even brother Russell he be he said it there in his prayer of there's generation that's going on and we have brother Mino and different Elders within the church first Generations that have walked with the prophet they've seen the Miracles they've seen the signs they they walk through the prayer lines they've seen all these wonders done by the prophet and they can tell the stories of what it was like to be in the days of the Prophet right and then as a generation goes on and now on four generations my grandfather was in the meetings and so you see a fourth generation with my son there's four generations separating amen that's right and it continues onise God but let it not be so of any generation that is amongst us that we don't know the works of almighty god of what God did even within the days of our prophet and as I sat down with you know uh Brothers my age and we have young families and we begin to discuss what is it going to be like if the Lord terries and our kids grow up and their kids and now now you have this generation that it's you know I can go and sit down with my grandfather who Pro you know walked through the prayer lines and they can tell you firsthand there's nothing like firsthand experience there's nothing like it that if somebody says that I've been there I've seen it and they tell a story well now we're going to get five year five gener ations down the road what a great responsibility it is for us to continue the fight because what happened in the days of Joshua there had to be a generation that begin to let down the bar they begin to walk away they begin to say you know what this fight isn't worth it the stories of the Prophet they're old it's done in past those are days gone past but let me tell you there's still power in those stories and as I begin to pray and you know there's things that come to you as far as you know you you get a minister and you might tell a testimony and you can say well I've heard that before or this testimony how does that tell you let me tell you our Prophet told testimonies and I begin to listen to those testimonies more sincere why because he's telling them for a purpose he's trying to bring the people's Faith up for a purpose so we see the judges they would serve God and then they would raise up but then there would be a man like shamgar there in judges that would rise up that would say that the Philistines kept coming after him and every year he would plant his seeds and he would PL his plant his crops and he would have a young family and he brother brandham dramatizes this and he would say his family you know they're just they ragged they don't have too much to eat maybe the kids and his wife they don't have too much but he said he would put the you know the Harvest into the barn and he would store it up and he would think well maybe I can go buy my wife a nice little dress and I can do this and maybe buy the little kitty something and he says and every year the Philistines would come and they would begin to come and they would begin to take away everything that was rightfully shamgar everything that he worked for everything that he slaved for everything that he saved up he was saving it up for a reason why it was to preserve him preserve his family but what happened the Philistines would come until one day let me tell you one day you get fed up you get sick and tired of being sick and tired you get fed up of all this you know Satan coming in and trying to take away all these things from you he get sick and tired and fed up and one of these times you're going to have to stand up and fight your ground us Lord shamard had enough of it and brother Brandon would call the indignation of his faith would rise up and he went out and he slew 600 Philistines now how does a man with an ox goat Slay Slay 600 Philistines you see shamard began to realize who he was he began to realize who he was he was a circumcised Israelite he was a Seed of Abraham he was air to the promise that the promises that God made was still a covenant with him he began to realize those things that were spoken of of Israel in the Seed of Abraham they were still good for his day it wasn't just of the past generation it wasn't just of the past people that were called out no it's of a current gener generation it's of a current people the Covenant stands true and brother brandom would tell us that if if shamgar be in the seed Jee be in the Seed of Abraham how much more is it for the faith Seed of Abraham Hallelujah to claim your promises to claim what is rightfully yours preparation his righteous indignation Rose he grabbed that Ox goat and jumped through the window and challenged 600 Philistines and stood there and beat their heads in why not a warrior not at all but he was an Israelite he was circumcised he realized who he was and if tonight you're circumcised with the Holy Ghost you don't have to wait until you're a trained Warrior let me tell you you don't have to wait till you know your scripture in and out you don't have to be able to quote all these quotes you don't have to do all these things no no no no if you're trained listen you don't have to wait to be trained just realize who you are Lord open our Father God bless your heart he said claim your god-given PR Privileges and beat their heads and amen that's right get out of the way Satan kick him out of the way I'm the guy that's taken over now I come in jesus' name watch him scatter brother when you use that faith on him he will back up sometimes you got to realize the faith that's in you listen it's not your dad's Faith or your parents' Faith or your pastor's Faith No it's the faith that God has given youall something's got to rise up within you each one of us has a choice which way will you choose for the men singing it we each have a choice you have to make the decision yourself it's easy whenever the kids are young you tell them brother Paul get in the car time to go to church time to do this let's have it's easy but when they come to the age of accountability that's why we got to instill in our young ones now we got to instill more we got to instill stories and things that the prophet did and what the Bible tells us yes sir why because listen that's going to be something that they can use later down the road raise up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he won't depart we all have to come the same way and I spoke on this a little bit on watch night there on free moral agency brother M mentions this 51 times you know it's good go and look through that free moral agency because you see that's the devil's bagging ground that's right you're going to find out that God uses one thing or that he allowed man to use or Satan to use one thing and he uses this free moral agency and you know I begin to look into it because I was talking with a denominational man and he began to just your conversation begins to go and then he begins to ask me do you believe in predestination yeah I do and do you believe in this yeah and then he begin to talk about you know when you begin to talk about the Bible with somebody and they're trying to testify to you I love it because they think you don't know but you do and you're just going along with it and you know I don't try in that situation to try to overtake the the conversation you know sometimes we can take that away from people somebody's trying to testify to us and tell us what God did for them and then we well let me tell you brother no let them tell you what God did for them be in ear listen to him so he began to tell me about you know his brother and he began to help his brother and he was an Army veteran and you know he began to help his brother and he began to witness to me because he was telling talking about his brother and his brother you know he had a hard life and he wasn't there cuz he was in the military and so his brother lives back east and so with his business he moved him out here and he's like I was able to you know help him out I was able to give him a place to stay and you know I was able to give him a car and I was able to provide a job and I was able to do all these things for him but yet give it a couple of months and he left and he's like and he was talking and he's trying to witness to his brother and he was like I believe in predestination and I believe that our footsteps are ordered and he kept going on about his brother but then he told he's like there's a self-choice is what he called it there's a self choice that we all have and he began to talk to me about this and I I begin to ask myself well what's different between us and denomination what's different between us and all these you know Pentecost and all these different denominations out there amen because whenever you begin to see these people are saying the same thing but there comes a point there comes a point listen that the prophet takes us so much farther we have a prophet in this day who begin to come and reveal himself in such a way he begin to show us no this is free moral agency and I can take you all the way back to Genesis back when Adam and Eve began and I can take you from there and I can take you to right now to anci individual you're based on free moral agency and the prophet of God in our Day begin to show us types and shadows he began to show us things and as I was even talking to him he began to talk about you know he he told me the Old Testament is just stories of the past it's a history book and he says you know where we begin is in in in the in the New Testament because that's where Jesus died on the cross and he rose again for our sins and that's he's like so that's what but yet we had a prophet in our day that begin to come and he begin to show us Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new what happened then is what going to happen at the end do you understand that it's God showing us and I thank God he sent us a prophet to open our eyes of understanding thank you Jesus and he showed us from Genesis to Revelations and let's read here does God change his mind he says now to be a savior there had to be something lost and God cannot purposely lose anything and then redeem it it could wouldn't be becoming to his Holiness and his great judgment but he put a man on free IM moral agency knowing that man would fall and in that then he became man himself in order to redeem back man that fell that's the reason Jesus became was Emanuel God With Us he says if God sent another person besides himself then that wouldn't be just God had to come himself and take it place and God could not come down in the spirit to take place he had to be made flesh and In the Flesh of his own creative son what was God doing his son had to come down he had to walk and he wanted to feel what it was like to be tempted to be tried he wanted to know what the pains you feel and the what you're going through when you say your heart is hurting and the different burdens that you would bear he wanted to feel the pain of those and yet his son came down and what was he put on from moral agency why because in the Garden of Eden when he came down and he he had to make a choice and he said father if it be your will let this cup pass from me listen it wasn't his will because as a man it feels that you can feel that pain you can feel that hurt but he said not my will thine be done he made a choice that affected us all he made a choice he was thinking of you and I he knew that you would be tested on freeer agency but because he overcome you can overcome also perseverance he says we have a body and our being is like a seed and he goes through the outers like a shell and then you have the pulp and inside the pulp's a germ he said that's the way the Body Soul and Spirit and we know the five senses and this five Avenues to the soul and he says inside is one what Avenue and that Avenue is the same place that God said every man from Adam and Eve self-will he says you will to live and you will to die either you want one it's your it's your basis on free moral agency and whatever a spirit that you let dominate you will bring forth the fruits your life will be dominated from the inside amen listen to that your life will be dominated by the inside it's not these outside things that are happening it's not outside things that you're allowing into your life you can say all movies you know all these you know the websites and whatever can bother you and this temptation and that Temptation no no no those are just the attributes of what's on the inside reflecting that if you're more attracted to Earthly things and worldly things it's just a reflection on what's going on on the inside you're dominated by what's on the inside it's just being made manifest very good so many people rely upon these five senses on the outside they're fine nothing against them if they agree with that six sense amen he says this Soul this Spirit only can be of two kinds one of them is the spirit of God and the other spirit is of the devil you can't serve two masters at the same same time you're either wholly given to one or wholly given to the other and if you've got the spirit of God you've got faith and you'll believe every word of God that God wrote amen amen that's right you'll believe every word that God wrote that's how you'll know what's dominating on the inside if you're attracted to the things of God if you want to be in the house of God if you want to do the things of God that's what's dominating on the inside he says you can't help being what you are even if you're a sinner you're not responsible for being a sinner you're responsible for remaining a sinner ain't that something powerful you're only responsible for remaining a sinner there's a pro there's a way provided for you but to be a sinner you was born that way God doesn't send you to hell for being a sinner God sends you to hell because you won't repent and take Christ as your savior listen to those words God isn't condemning you because you're in a state of of being a sinner no it's your choice it's your choice to remain a sinner we are all born in sin shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lies that's right that's why each one of us has to come one in the same through the basis of free moral agency true you refuse to take the right Road you send yourself to torment you send your soul to into to its Eternal destination upon free moral agency of your own convictions amen it's your own convictions let me stop there something your own convictions many times within the message we have you get people that oh this is my conviction and this my conviction be careful make sure it's based upon the word of God take it back to the word of God and if it don't line up if it don't line up with the prophet taught us listen get away with that own conviction amen because if you base things upon your own conviction and your own convictions wrong where is that going to take you God doesn't send anyone to hell he never did never will man sends themselves to hell because they refuse to accept the pride and way of Salvation he's longsuffering he doesn't want any man to perish he never wanted it he never wanted it man sends themselves to hell he has a provided way this evening if you're a sinner if your lives aren't lined up in this late hour that we are living listen time is rapidly going you don't have much time that's right you don't don't have much time amen yeah and as great and as big as God is you would think within we understand through a prophet he would do it in a certain way but thinking naturally as big and it as as God is you would think that he would create such a way that he could come and condense in down that he wouldn't allow man to fall he would have made a provided way without having men to Fall Away but yet he wanted to express his attributes he wanted to express being a savior being a Healer being a deliverer so he had to send man that way through free moral agency and this last one here and he had his heart before the foundation God had in his heart before the foundation of the world a son because he is a father but it was still in the genes of his word I think that's so powerful be it was in the genes of his word and he created a man and he put him on free moral agency but that man fell but the great sculptor God who made man from the dust of the earth he didn't settle for that he didn't settle for that he started making man again I'm so thankful tonight that he didn't settle for that he didn't settle because one man made a mistake he didn't settle because e Adam and Eve fell no no no he made it he made man in his own image but then they fell and he began right back over again thank you Lord and he made Noah and he died a drunk and he made Moses that failed to keep his word he made prophets that ran in the time of trouble and he kept building and molding until after he wanted the Masterpiece to reflect him his nature that was in his heart what a son should be you see he kept molding and he kept making and he began as I can imagine you know I don't know if you've ever been on on a wheel on a Potter's will and you begin to work with it and I did it with my wife Allison it's stressful way more stressful it's supposed to be a ni relaxing bonding time but let me tell tell you if you ever go and do it let me tell you you'll realize what happens to the clay whenever you're not under the Master's Hand because the biggest thing when you begin to mold something from the very start what do you do you plop it down right in the middle of the wheel yeah and you begin to add moisture and you begin to add moisture and you begin to make it and mold it right in the center of the wheel because if you're not in the center of the will let me tell you you as time goes on you're going to get wobbly as time goes on your Clay is going to start wobbling like this and what you do is you get in the center of the wheel and you begin to work it up and you begin to work it up and as it goes then you turn that wheel to full speed turn it to full speed because if it can't stand the test at full speed it won't stand the test at allj so you turn it to full speed and you begin to crank that thing and as long as the clay stays Center in that will you can begin to mold it you begin to mold it into whatever you want it to be but if it's not Center and if it's not in that center it's going to get wobbly like this and that's what happens and we don't want to get down in our Christian Life and we think that we're in the center of his will and we get out of position and maybe we don't have enough moisture and what happens as time goes on you begin to get wobbly and you begin to get wobbly and what what happens the Potter has to smatch it down start over yeah and that's not a fun place to be but he's going to do it he will do it he'll get you to where you need to be and I'm so thankful that it's not something let me tell you when I was molding and I kept trying and I kept trying you know what I kept doing oh Lord forgive me I'm throwing this clay away because you know what I couldn't get it but then you know the the master she came with her touch and she said listen this is what you got to do and she begin to work me and she begin to show show me exactly how it's supposed to be molded and when you get get it into the center let me tell you you can make whatever you want God and you think that as God he began to mold this masterpiece Amen on God's Great will you know what he began to do he begin to mold one character he begin to add some attributes maybe some characteristics maybe maybe he's a little strong-headed maybe he's a little this maybe he's a little that maybe he would mold this person this way and we begin to get molded and God instead of throwing the Clay Away what did he do he you know what he you take the wire and you cut it off the wheel and you set it aside you know what he was doing he says I'm going to make Noah and I'm going to mold him or he's like I'm going to make a man and I think this might be the son I might be this might be the characteristics and then he said you know what I'm just going to cut him off and I'm going to set him aside and I'm going to name him MOA Noah then he would begin to mold another characteristic and he would add things to him and add this to him and Leadership and all these things he's going to have to leave the people out of Israel and I'm going to add these things into him maybe this will be my son this is what he'll be like he said you know what that's not it that doesn't look right let me set him over here I'm going to name him Moses and he began to do that through the Bible until he came can you imagine we know the story of Michelangelo that the sculptor as he would be begin and he had that image in his mind he would begin to mold him in such a way and to save time we know that he would get to the end of his the this image he would get to the end of the image and it was in the Perfection that he had imagined in his mind it wasn't there was nothing that he had to add to or take away there was no characteristics it was just the way the Son of God was supposed to be what did he do smoted it it was such in the image that he had imagined it was so real in his mind that he wanted it to speak and he says here right in the next quote he right in the next line he says one day down on the Jordan after that Masterpiece had been molded and made here he come descending down on the wings of a dove and said that's him this is him he was so enthused with this masterpiece until he struck him on Calvary that he had to die for the rest of us that's imperfect that through the shedding of blood he might bring a many Masterpiece being a bride to his son Masterpiece scarred because of the enthusiasm of God to see such a masterpiece he struck him for all of us there he died to perfect we who are imperfect the Masterpiece hallelujah what a beautiful thing it's only by the blood that the shedding of the blood that we are able to approach the throne of God it's only by the blood that we are made whole it's only by the blood by his mercy and his grace when God said he would fight our battles am it wasn't with sword and spear amen the great General didn't he didn't come down and said oh he could have brought the whole host of the of Heaven to come down and fight for us that's right what did he do he took his only begotten son he said this is how I'm going to fight I'm not going to fight with sword and shield I'm not going to fight the way that men carnally fight I'm going to fight with Grace I'm going to fight with Mercy I'm going to fight with love I say Lord help us Lord help us listen stop fighting stop fighting amongst us stop fighting all this listen we're we're called to this battle but we fight differently you go the weapons of our our Warfare are not carnal when one offends you what do you do turn the cheek it's hard to do I say Lord help us he says I will fight for you I've already paid the price of redemption he didn't base it upon man because as we see we can look at different characters one that came to mind was Samson because Samson was raised and he have a covenant with God and we know in Samson's life he had this Covenant and he always fell back to that Covenant he always fell back to it when he would get in trouble what would he do he'd just pull out and start fighting yeah he would get caught between an army and what would he do BR get the Jawbone of an that be to fight and he began to play with his Covenant one too many times he began to play with that Covenant because God is with you let me tell you he will fight your battles he will go before you and he will protect you and when he's got a covenant with you let me tell you God always keeps his Covenant that's right and he keeps that Covenant but yet man can abuse his Covenant because he knows he began to flirt with the world he began to talk with this girl and when God came or Satan came in what did he do he fought off the the the devil there and another thing rose up and an army came against him and what did he do he would fight against it but as we watch Samson's life and we see that as Samson progressed he would begin to fight and he would be begin to fight physically But as God be would begin to Humble him and he gave up that Covenant and he would fall into slavery into bondage and he would fall into such a place that his eyes were plucked out and he became a laughing stalk and he would walk around as a mule or as an ox he came to such a place and it was one of being in a free moral agent Samson would choose to go that route Samson made choices in his life that would put him in that predicament and so we see that Samson he would fight with his physical hands but there came a place in Samson's life that he fought differently he fought differently when he would begin to feel the locks of his hair and he would reach up and he would begin to feel that strength and that Covenant come back listen he didn't have to go and beat down beat down the enemy and fight what did he say he was led by a boy to the to the to the pillars there and God used him to slay more in his death than he did his whole life many times we try to fight our battles physically many times we're trying to fight and possess in such a way but yet th this Warfare let me tell you is a is a faith warfare that's why the Bible said and we read it in the beginning fight the good fight of Faith because it is a fight of faith God is going to use your weapon of faith God is going to use the faith that you have inside of you when Giants and stuff come in your life and sicknesses listen this isn't we we're talking about shamard and he beat the devil's head and brother brandom saying beat that devil beat that deil well where's the devil and many times it's not a physical Warfare but what is it doing you're beating them with your faith that you got that you say I'm already healed by his stripes I'm Healed he's already made the Redemption he's already paid the price that's right it's not you fighting it's your faith through him and in him is what's going to beat your enemy that's right that's what's going to beat the devil it's not based upon our own ability you know uh Elementary saying is sticks and stones break my bones but words will never hurt me that is so false that is so untrue because I guarantee you you've been hurt by more by words you've been hurt more by words than somebody ever hitting you with a sticker stone or fighting you physically because our words carry power if men as I said Can Inspire other men to do such things yeah how much more does our words carry a carry a power or carry an anointing let us be careful with our words you see that's if we say words are just words then what did God used to create in the beginning if we are little gods and we say that God in the beginning created he didn't have nothing to work with but his words and when he began to speak things began to happen amen when he began to Speak Life came to pass when he began to speak things would go into orbit when he began to speak things come into order so let me say that God whenever a vessel or when a minister or a song leader or a song let me tell you words carry meanings they carry purpose they carry a power behind them 1 Timothy 6 fight the good fight of Faith it's a good fight of faith you know and as I begin to look that fighting to live is fighting to die fighting to live is fighting to die you say what do you mean by that because when you're fighting to live you're fighting to die against your own self ambition your own self- desires your own self- wants the things of this world when you become one willing to give your life for the cause of Christ that is when God can use you amen you see the greatest warriors or the greatest Fighters you can look back and men that would earn the Purple Heart or they would earn some rewards for going above and beyond why because they didn't have a fear they knew what they were fighting for they knew their purpose that was to fight was to win the to win the battle they weren't worried about dying because they knew where they were going they knew that this is my purpose on Earth is to fight this fight but yet what happened happens if you're not fully committed if you're not if you're not die hard if you're not all in let me tell you it's going to be hard brother Brandon would say in this story that was I I believe it's the power of God or I can't remember in 55 but he was telling this story of a woman I want you to understand where our faith has to lie if it's a good it's a good fight of Faith this woman was at the a hotel there if I can remember right she was staying in the same Hotel of brother brandom and he as he tells it she he's walking in he hears a woman crying down in the corner and he says ma'am is everything all right can I help you and she would you know looked up and said oh brother brandom and then he's like I knew he says brother brandom I didn't get a prayer card I didn't get a prayer card and I didn't have an opportunity to come through the prayer line but I knew that if I could if we found the hotel that you were staying in and as you walked by and your Shadow would would craw come across me I knew I would be healed hallu what faith what faith and let me tell you that something so familiar because there's a woman in the Bible that knew that if she could get to Jesus if she could get to a man that that had that such power and it was God what faith did she have have and she would go on and tell them about she would go on and tell him about this you know they would they were calling him a witch and they were calling him a sorcerer they're at the meetings and brother brandom says I'm going to go to battle he says cuz the Lord fights for me amen she says brother brandom you're really going to do that you're going to call it out you're going to go after these guys and so he shows up to the meeting and as he walks in he say a I believe it was a black cod or a black something black and it was over here and it went across an audience of four or 5,000 people and he says it hovered over two men he says he thought it was the because they were telling him it was the FBI they're going to come after you they're going to shut your down they're going to shut down these meetings and he says he thought it was the FBI but this this black cloud went across the audience and it landed on two men he says they were backsliding preachers they were backsliding preachers calling all this out and trying to shut it down and cause an uproar and when he got to the pulpit yes let me tell you when God stands behind you yes sir you don't have to worry that's right when God stands behind you he's going to back his servant and he called him out and he says if I'm a sorcerer and he was going to have a showdown right there on that platform he says if I'm a sorcerer you come down and stand on the platform for and if I'm not God's servant he'll smite me dead but he says if I am his servant he's going to Smite you dead and he says we'll wait we'll wait for you to come down and he says we sang A Hymn and we allowed it and we allowed 30 minutes to pass by he says them two men got up they walked over and they walked out he says they never came why because the devil don't like a showdown the devil's a bluff let me tell you when he tries to say you're not called and you're not saved and you're not healed and you can let me let me tell you something we got evidence tonight that God is the same yesterday today and forever when they came with Joshua and Joshua became and they went over and him and Caleb said we're not able to possess the land it didn't matter what they said why because they brought evidence back they brought evidence back showing this is the proof that that that land is everything that that's our inheritance praise the Lord let me tell you within this message we got ones sister s that's been healed by cancer different ones that God's done things for you you are evidence of everything that God has promised when he says I will fight your battles he's going to back you every time musicians come he says the power of God he said sure I said come and see the Lord in battle I love this I had to add this in at the end he says come and see the Lord in batt battle you know he's wonderful in healing see him in battle one time see what go how great God is there I said oh how marvelous he is in battle I said I've never seen him come to a battle in yet in what he come out packing the victory Hallelujah Lord even when when they put him in the put him in hell he put his head oh on the feet of the neck of the devil and took the keys of death away from him arose on the third day even in death he come out and trumpet said Satan you ain't got nothing on him Hallelujah let me tell you if he's great in healing and he's great in Miracles and he's done things in your life let let us say thank you God for doing those things thank you Jesus but he's so great in battle he Hallelujah he's so great in battle he's never lost to one he's never lost a [Music] one second Timothy 4 and7 I trust we could all say this when we come to to the end of our road that I have fought the good fight I have finished the race and I have kept the [Music] faith let me tell you Saints stay in the battle stay in the fight amen just as the Philistines would come after shamgar every year let me tell you we turn the page of a calendar and Satan's going to come he's going to come he's going to try to take what is rightly belong full to us but you're going to have to you're going to have to stand your ground amen you're going to have to fight the good fight of Faith that's right true a you might say well I I don't have much in my hand I know I've told the story of Arnold van Winkler it didn't matter where at that time there was a bunch of farmers it was a bunch of ranchers or whatever they were and when God moved upon him and he became so inspired what did he say men today I give my life for my country he says take whatever you've got whatever is in your hand I don't care if it's a pitchfork a shovel young men I don't care if you know the scripture too well and you can quote all these quotes let me tell you take what God has given you and keep praying and keep seeking the mind of God because he says all these things I'll add unto you when you put God first and Arnold oh he gave his life for his [Music] country and I trust that we stay in the fight and we realize it's just not stories it's not just scripture that we read of God in saying I will be with thee and I will will go before thee and I will fight for you oh their promises [Music] Saints let's stand to our feet you love them tonight let's just bow our heads in our [Music] hearts father we love you tonight Lord you're so good to us
