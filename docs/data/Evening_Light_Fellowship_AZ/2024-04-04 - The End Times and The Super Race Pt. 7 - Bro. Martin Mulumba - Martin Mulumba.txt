bless you tonight bless you brother uh let's uh take our bibl in the Book of Luke chapter 6 get you off your feet very quickly verse one and it came to pass on the second Sabbath after the first that he went through the corn of fields and his disciples plucked the ears of corn and did itat rubbing them in their hands may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated uh once again I greet you all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ uh thanking our precious Pastor for the opportunity uh for letting us back again here as uh the Lord uh I was uh telling him one time we were standing out there that the Lord has uh LED things in uh such a Simplicity that uh as uh uh professionally what I do had to this period of time is a a little bit of h a little bit of hard time to be focused on two things as to try to multitask is not always a good thing to do and uh I sat one day and uh was talking to the Lord not necessarily praying but I was just sitting and working and say Lord with all this I don't want to just walk up here just for uh knowledge and and show and stuff and I just stopped there and uh the next day brother Ron was in my text like hey I'm wanting you to do this I said well he knows uh how to lead things amen uh by his grace and uhu and during all this period I believe I was in Mexico um in January right after that that's where the busy season started and the Lord just gave me all the time for work and just as soon as uh finished uh with the busy season here I am on the pulpit and uh the next three weeks I'm out again so pray for me uh as the Lord uh is leading all these things in uh such a Simplicity that uh he shows that it's not knowledge it's not the desire to be standing and preaching and and being on the field but by his grace is uh making the work uh go smoothly and so that we not stressed and stuff uh by God's grace I'll try to finish up with what we had started uh it is a little bit long but I'll just just try to squeeze things because as time goes living time in between it becomes a little bit too watered so you'll bear with my language tonight if it's a little too compressed by God's grace you take the time to uh research those things because you know we've been uh looking into Luke 20 uh2 but tonight I'm uh shifting quickly into Luke 6 um to try to uh just uh um close things up a little bit but God's grace we'll uh be speaking on the super race so we started with uh the end times and the super race but uh this will be part seven and we'll just try to do uh this tonight the super race and to try to close it up as uh we just read here in the book uh Luke 6 verse1 uh Luke has been a very very interesting a very big blessing for me for um maybe six seven years now that it keeps coming up we started uh it looked three and now look six and Luke 22 when all we are acquainted with Luke 177 uh but uh there's more as uh you go deep into it because himself in Luke 1 he says uh dear beloved uh Theophilus uh have taken the time to search these things from the very beginning so that we know with certainty we have uh uh the the understanding the perfect understanding this these things that are commonly believed among us but um we don't read the Bible like the rest of uh the people out there because we are a privileged people um as uh the Lord has given us the eyes to see the things that were hidden from all these times here uh we see that in Luke 6 verse1 and it came to pass on the second Sabbath after the first we can quickly see two sabbaths uh the first Sabbath a Sabbath is uh seven days um seven days and B Bram will get to it it shows us a little bit more how to look at the Sabbath and how to understand this that was the first Sabbath and on the second Sabbath certain event took place because on the first Sabbath also events uh took place so when we read about the Sabbath we don't read it historically we don't read it as uh uh just any scholar that goes and reads about the Sabbath but it says it came to pass on the second Sabbath after the first that certain things event took place that he went through the corn of field and his disciples plucked the ears of corn and he did itat rubbing them with their hands we see that the same Jesus uh that was on the first Sabbath came into the second Sabbath and on the second Sabbath he had his disciples and the disciples that we saw in uh Luke 22 that were s and whining about like who should be the greatest who should be counted the greatest he started dealing with them on a different level he took them from the justification level now bringing them into sanctification but then the sanctification level he was dealing with the disciples the rest of the Pharisees verse two and certain of the S Pharisees said unto them why do do ye that which is not lawful to do on the on the Sabbath days because they were not acquainted with that level of the ministry they started saying well we as the Methodist we do this here when we have to eat the corn we have to wash our hands and all these ways of looking at things but Jesus was moving the ministry a little higher so he can enable the disciples into a whole another dimension that's where now the super race idea comes into view but then in verse 6 and it came to pass also another uh on another Sabbath now this is now the third Sabbath there was the justification level there was the sanctification level but then on the on the uh on on the third Sabbath at the end there he says and the scribes uh verse 7 and the scribes and Pharisees watched him whether he would heal on the Sabbath day they were saying the days of Miracle has passed because they couldn't see God's program as he was coming to pass because they were blinded but Jesus had certain disciples that he was bringing along with because the same Jesus we see in the midst of the seven Church ages is the same one walking along and has is bringing the church along those sabbaths people but then the Pharisees they were caught in the denominational Rivers they couldn't see the moving of the eer of God's program and they were standing there they said well the there of miracle has pass you can't be healing in these days anymore but then Jesus looked at him at them and says well is it good for us to do good in the Sabbath or to do evil because people were coming to the meetings they were seeing the son of man at the end of the third Sabbath which is the pente the Pentecostal Feast feast and they were standing they say well what are you going to do about all these people who have needs yeah they couldn't help because it was not given unto them because all the devil can throw all kind of disease upon God's children but he can't take it away but then God now who is rich in Mercy has to come down himself in order to provide thy healing because I am the Lord that Health thee of all thy diseases so then this Lord now was coming now he says but verse 8 but he knew the thoughts we see the first pool there of healing and the second pool of discernment coming into this place Jesus standing there among them at the end of the third Sabbath and Jesus as he was dealing with them he said but he knew the thoughts but then they couldn't understand what kind of Ministry they were dealing with they couldn't see that God was made flesh in De day they couldn't see that the promise of Isaiah was coming to be fulfilled and as now they were sitting and they were looking but they were bound because in the uh book of kings and Chronicles when they were taken out into Babylon they came back into they went into three waves and came back with three waves and they didn't know again all what God has promised for the time people were dealing with all kind of things but then the same Jesus now comes back now is showing the people that at the end of that Sabbath this what I'm going to do and he's performing it that Emmanuel was among them and as Emmanuel was made flesh among them to them he was the next fellow daugh son he was just the next fellow daughter he was just like you know somebody that we know in the church but they didn't see God and morre being made manifest among them because the promise was not given to them but the promise was given to the air sons of Abraham because the seed shall continue on because the devil tried to destroy the seed along the church edges through the Dark Ages but then again under another Sabbath Martin Luther started the journey then Wesley started the journey but then now at the end now of the Pentecostal Feast now there comes now the first frood fruit that has to be waved upon the people but then now this is where now Jesus is showing them that hey look at all this year especially in the message that we have seen this ministry come along and has the ministry come along verse 12 now he says and it came to pass in those days meaning in the days of the third Sabbath it says that in those days it that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God because Jesus had dealt with the denominations and showed them the signs that they supposed to receive because they they asked him like you know give us a sign he said in adulterous their generation nothing will be given to them that a sign the the of of Jonas and also in this day we must also receive a sign and the sign that is promised now to the Believers it was a God to be Med flesh fulfilling exactly as it was done in Genesis 19 and has now the word is coming to pass but then the Lord doesn't just go to them as we have seen them in the previous messages that Jesus was came down all uh Elohim came down to make to investigate what was taking place in the land because we have seen Babylon how it came about how Nimrod came into the land how Nimrod had divided the people divided the language uh put all kind of ranks among the people and things but then in this time now Jesus says he went into Prayer by going into prayer it was not a matter of Jesus coming and selecting people by his own desire because the son doeth nothing except he has sin done by the father and also in these last days we have seen also that one had to go into prayer telling his wife that I am tired of seeing all these Visions I am tired of seeing all this year they're calling this that that I'm having bad suppers and I'm I'm having a a weir Spirit upon me let me go and pray if I don't come back after a certain number of days replace somebody after me amen and when he went there then we can see that Jesus by going into prayer all night he must have received a visitation by receiving that visitation that we see that Jesus comes down that when it was day he called unto him his disciples because he was popular in those days he was called unto his disciples and and of them he chose 12 of whom he named Apostles many people were gathered after the three sabbaths has completed the first pool had come and and come and been manifested the second one has come and manifest but then on this level of the ministry now it's no more a public event it's not more given to everybody but now the son of man goes now to call by name certain people and these certain people now is the super race we see it as brother Bram lays it out that these people that he's calling is after God's Vision because Jesus just did the preacher just didn't come and chose like you know Sister sit there brother sit there and all these things here no but then the Lord had to make them available for them to be present at that meeting that Jesus was called to call them by [Music] name and it says a Simon he called whom he also named Peter and and Andrew his brother James and John philli and B Matthew and Thomas uh James the the son of alus and and Simon called called zelotes and Judah the brother of J of James and Judah is scariot which also was the traitor all these names but also in among them also one was a traitor according to God's Vision yes sir Jesus God himself gives the vision to call people by name to give them the position to give them the part of this ministry to be partaker to eat the Mana because from the very beginning all the disciples were able to fit in with a justification brother Jesus loves you everybody amen sister put on a long dress on the second saath amen they even come to the ministry remember brother Bram said that the devil can bring somebody among you give him a position all this is it God's Vision yes sir but then remember now the Lord is looking for a super race and the super race all of us have come through the same Journey as we saw that hey the uh the seed of nimrod they all look just like us but they have a powerful thought in mind when Judah was coming into the temple chosen by God was coming with a powerful thought in mind because the same agenda that Nim had from the very beginning by destroying all the seeds of God along the journey all the prophets he was also going to do it with Jesus right but then all of this is Al part of God's Vision that's why we are always delivered unto death you go the criticize you they don't look at you as important and all this year you look what did I do to them it's part of God's Vision that's right why me why they don't give me this opportunity why should I fight for this and this or that and when you understand God's program quickly now you start seeing it is important for Judah to be right there and it's to Judah that they have given all the money of the world Amen because all these things are given to us for our examples so we know that the situation the condition that the Lord put God put Jesus in the world is also going to apply to all of us why am I picking up all these uh three sabbaths like that Feast of the trumpets uh brother sorry you can uh probably pull up the table to bring this up I didn't send it to you um uh Feast of the trumpet paragraph 228 and and seven Sabbath is the seven Church ages Church ages get it see see now the Jew had been blinded waiting all this time while Pentecostal Pentecostal first fruit had been poured out upon the church historically you can uh follow along so it makes more sense so I don't have to go into too many details and when we uh and and we've come down through the mar age and down through reformers age and now in the calling out three sections Same Spirit like Father Son and Holy Ghost same one see but seven Church ages being seven sabbaths right exactly seven sabbaths from the Pentecostal Jubilee a a Pentecostal Jubilee Feast the waving of the shiv and then the Pentecostal Jubilee and then from the Jubilee to the atonement is seven Sabbath 50 days and at the end of the 50 days the atonement is made you you get it now and this has been a type that the church when he was revealed himself as Son of God has been revealing to the church in the baptism of the Holy Ghost down through the ages in the Pentecostal age just keep getting more and more justification under Luther sanctification under Wesley baptism of the Holy Ghost then we come on now this great being that we've been talking about that he wants to do a certain work in the same message paragraph 99 and the angel or the man why did Sarah say that in her heart yeah at the end of the Pentecostal age after the first fruit has been poured out now we see that the angel he says and the angel oh the men amen the man said to Sarah amen the man was asking why isn't the church believing yeah the church has seen the three sabbaths have seen the justification sanctification and the out pouring of the first fruit but now the angel is standing there looking at the church giving them the sign that they were supposed to receive but the church is there doubting because they are not expecting the angel in their form because we saw it last last service that we spoke about the condescending of the Lord the Lord coming down into Babylon because we saw that coming down is not a movement of up and down but is the god changing forms now the issue now with eror is the fact that he wants to see the angel in the form that he wants to see [Applause] her but God who is rich in Mercy who is a sovereign he said no I want you to know me by my word that's right I want you to know me by my word because if you can't tell no understand who I am the day that I will change the form and you miss me then quickly you fall under the umbrella of nimrod because nimr when he came he divided the people but then now when he comes he say no no no I'll take whatever form I need but I need you to recognize who I am because under that Ministry the revelation of the son of man I'll take whatever shape and form that I need in the form of that light in the form of the angel in the form of the prophet in the form of the brother in the form of the sister but it is still the same God made flesh and as now is being made flesh and being manifested now he said well I need you to be able to understand my program because if you understand my program and the way I behave just like in the book of uh of songs he says like you know my beloved is like unto a unto like a young a heart he's keeping on the mountains today you see him in one form tomorrow is in another form and as he coming down the mountains you see that the word is being revealed as I am growing in the word and as the word is being revealed unto us the closer we are looking more now more clearly because the perfect one has come because after the second Sabbath and and the third Sabbath in those days is the day that he's coming to look for the bride praise the Lord and this bride now must understand how he belovs her beloved her beloved Works how he walks how he talks how he behaves how he changes form and what and when he changes the form what type of work is he going to do in that [Applause] form because William Bram we have seen him along the journey when you you look through the message you see him he says well all the time that that angel has come I've never worshiped him right right he knew the difference but the very minute that angel was on the pulpit without being seen he said I'm waiting for him to take place amen he knows that when the angel appears in a human form he knows that this is not the form to worship and that's the problem now also with those who worship the prophet right yes you have seen great things yes you have seen the discernment but that form is not to be worshiped amen and the angel oh the man why did s say that in her heart in the tent behind him why did did he say did she did she say these things cannot be see a man in human flesh like a prophet and yet it was Elohim Discerning the thought that was in the in Sarah heart amen like a prophet amen yet it is Elohim but then all the Angels even in the Book of Revelation it says John do not worship me I know you have seen great things I know in Revelation one it says I Jesus have sent my angel right to teach these things to the churches but then at the end of all this great revelation of the Mysteries that you John do not worship me do not worship your wife do not worship your pastor yes she is obedient yes while the rest of the world the woman have become old that they have become and now that you have found Grace that God has given you that wife but she's not to be worship yes it is the Lord in human flesh but not to be worshiped because the age we are living in the woman now is now you have to worship me now for you to to marry me go on your knees no amen because when William Bram went to uh went to uh to Rome he wanted to meet the pope I'll give you all the titles you want I'll call you all that you want but to kneel for you no yes you have done great wonders you have built the big churches and the Great Schools and you've helped the world and all this but nevertheless we will not worship you worship is only reserved to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and now this Jesus that we have seen along the church edges is the one doing all this wonderful work it's not the man that's right the shape the forms that he taking should not be a stumbling block to us because we know to whom God is very jealous he can share his worship with anybody else when you start taking the worship that belongs to God and you give to the pastor to the minister to your race and to your country to all these things here then the Lord said well I'm going on to destroy it I'm going to destroy it the greatest nation of the world that everybody looks after but then at the end the Lord said like well King of the North come and take this thing out of my my sight that's true Nebuchadnezzar thought he was so he said oh look at the nation that I've built to look at me and all these things it say because you have lifted your heart because you think that you are the most beautiful one because you think you are the strongest one I'm going out to to bring you down right and I oh well all these things are taking place now it comes to the bride to teach them the word to bring the church to its original position and by coming back to that original position the church doesn't just sit there like that no the church is called onto a work because it is a super race and this super race is not called by aen denomination and men's doing and men's knowledge but it is called by God himself under his own program that's why Christ in the true church is the continuation of book of Acts books of Works things that we must do and this super race is called to do those works and as you finding your partner into your ministry now the Lord now is able to use you even more but then I warning don't be lifted up be humble brother say God is looking for a church aen a people that despite the blessing that is going to bless them but they will remain humble and humility is a very difficult thing to find in this last days because they've given you so many rights it is my right to do this it is my right to go to to school it is my right to do this year but that still small voice comes that's not your place this is your place and it is a big debate what should be a man's position how should a man treat his wife according to the right of the woman we are the feminist it is your right yes the disciple also wondered about the same things who should be accounted the greatest among us because the more right we have the more Liberty the stronger we are but in this last days God is now looking for a people under God's Vision Hallelujah because he prayed all night because William Brenham couldn't do it by himself he went to prayer and while he was praying then the angel came down even Jesus there in the garden of Geth and it couldn't help anymore he went into prayer then the angel come for us also in our turn to fulfill our ministry it's not just us going I'm going to do this I'm going to do that I can do this I can do that no right the same angel that we have seen on the first Sabbath the second Sabbath at the end of the third Sabbath and in those days in those days while he has left all the denomination Nations out right now he also wants to deal with those people right paragraph 2 210 uh a paradox paragraph 210 I said certainly Abraham said it it was it was one uh he he was the one talked to him he ought to know he said he was Elohim see he he come down to make an investigation listen to this has he's now in the investigation judgment we saw it last time see who is Believers the same Angel he wants to see who is Believers we come to church long dress that's good second Sabbath we believe we receive a message yes that's the first Sabbath but now he is come down now at the end of the third Sabbath now to see who is Believers and has is coming down he's not coming down just by his own ability to come down no he came to William Bram he said I came down from the presence of almighty God because this according to Hebrew true uh two this ministering Spirit sent from the presence of God to the Airs of Salvation as you are ministering it's according you have to have come from the presence of God and if you have not been from the presence of God how are you going to do it that's where the place of Judah comes into play you are in the message you know the message you have the knowledge you do it according to your understanding but you didn't come from the presence of God yes and because you didn't come from the presence of God quickly there you are now under Nimrod condition then you start finding out oh I like that brother better I like that sister better I really don't like to take pay uh be with that one because that's what Judas did why you why you wasting all this money on Jesus this money we should have used it for the poor but the poor is you have with you all the time that's what Nimrod Minds is to go to conquer and to take all the resources by flattering that's what Nimrod is doing along the along the way a brother that loves money more than the word of God a sister that is not submissive to the word of God and but being submissive to the boss at work it is the same thing see who is Believers we've been hollering so much about it just investigate see who really is Believers see he and he made himself manifest he sent the little weat type down in there lus 23 like in modern message we hear in Babylon but watch what he done it didn't done there to that church El he gave it a chance to yes he gives also the church a chance you did Lord You've dealt with the with uh with with the Pharisees you dealt with them you showed them all these things here but now what about us but also as he came down he investigated that's that was uh mainly last service that we saw but he also gives us a chance see what I mean well my God what did he do you know we made out of 16 different elements of the earth potassium petroleum and Cosmic light and what more he just reached over and got a handful of atoms and Cosmic light and petroleum said few step into Gabriel and made one step into it himself that's our God hallelujah while the world is looking for it somewhere out there but in Simplicity it takes a father here it takes a mother there puts them together and few there comes the body after a number of days the voice comes down do not defile yourself right do not drink because when you shall grow I shall have a work to do with you m Mama I'm hearing a voice are you just being delusional no I saw the bridge falling down yeah yeah amen I saw the bridge falling down am it didn't require to go to church for him to receive the vision because his first Vision that he has seen he was 18 months old because the very first voice that you heard you were a little baby you didn't know why you you said you had seen that dream that you had seen years ago you didn't know why you were always different from the rest of the crowd amen you didn't know why you were always attracted to certain things because that same Angel of the Lord is the one that has been following you on your first Sabbath on your second third and all the way to the end the Lord coming down to do what to deal with a super race and that super race has to understand that to and when he give his message to Abraham he vanish and turn right back to God again all the atoms and things just broke up like a fire breaks up the acid and and chemicals and uh in the wood and cold or whatever you burning turn back to the Unseen I'm so glad my father is like that amen because when you see these things give to you you know I came from eternity and I'm going back to eternity again this body of Flesh that I am carrying it's veiling the pill of fire and this pill of fire one of these days according to the promise I'm just going to live it out and then disappear and when that is given to us brother and the Bible says uh uh Revelation 5:6 and I beheld in low in the midst of the throne and of the phobes and in the midst of the helders stood the lamb as it was been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirit of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book for the four beasts and the um the four and 20 Elders fell down fell down before the lamb having every one of them Hops and golden veils of ERS which are the prey of the Saints and the Believers and de bride and you and me we sng a new song because he has we have seen him along our church ages we have seen him along our Sabbath and now as it comes to the end now of the journey what does he do it takes the seals of our lives and open it unto us yes what have you been what have you been all these years what where have I taken you heart of because out of the edges comes the seals because under the seals is the foreshadow of the things that has taken place and how it's going to happen that's right and once the Brilliance of the revelation of the CH seven Church ages is given like a Roman Candle you see the PDN you see the projection you see the issue you know what is going to happen amen the lack of humility will now tell you how what you have to work on right Lord I need thy humility because if I'm not humble this is how I'm going to end up because the program is given unto me because everything is revealed and as it is revealed now the bride now has to take now the word and be able to work within it and they sang a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book and to open the sales thereof right nobody I went to to to the psychologist and to the psychics and everybody the doctors and and nobody was able to explain it to me because even Dr Davis who said that you know you had a a bad supper somebody else said like you know oh John by writing the book of uh Revelation he he didn't know what he was talking about how can somebody write things like this how could you be like that like the rest of the people because the book of Our Lives was sealed yes because nobody nobody was found worthy to even look at you nobody cares about me because you were a seal book but then in Revelation 5 when we see him like John taking our lives start understanding our Strange and misunderstood life then now we standing now revealed now we start singing a new song and the new song is not an idea of a man like our country our culture my ideas your ideas what do you think no sir but it is the same Angel taking now this super race because the supernatural God is coming into natural bodies to make them Supernatural and as is bringing now this super natural God is coming down in the form of a human flesh and it begins it with the wave sheave one first that comes to maturity among us correct look what he has become look at his life Journey look at his life story and you two are coming also this way he has also shown you how Nimrod has come about how he came into the land he said like you know show you first in M of Jesus but he wasn't as close as we would like it to be because he was born without sin but he required also one Among Us born in sin Shepherd iniquity coming into this world speaking lies and bring him also to that maturity and everything that we have seen being done with him we also have the promise because when the slaves were there the bondage one now had to go up the mountain and as he went up the mountain then when he start seeing the rising of the sun then the rest of them know it is our Liberty now it is now our Shalom and as we sing Our Shalom now we know we are no more Bound by the denominational River we know that our way out now amen and when he went out he didn't just say go back and sit back home no because when you receive that Ministry when you receive that manifestation you can hide it because you don't like to candle and you hide it under the bed but it has to be put on the mountain and you are the Mountain of God the great Jerusalem the great Zion that has to shine forth the lights all over the place each one of us in our Ministries at home at school at work in our diverse places says this great mystery angel of God made manifest in you and while is being made manifest for you to sit down no so the old mindset of nimr is something of the past because when Jesus was lifted up he lifted up so high that he had to look the uh the skies down so also you also when you are lifted up out of all the cultural things and all these things now we are them as filthy because what did Paul say he said like you know now I look at all this account them as done all that we thought that we were all that we thought that we could have been be I am this I am that you look at that has done because that was the scheme of nimrod to try to show you that you are something different that's what he went to tell Eve that you will become God while he was already God that's right that's why the angel of the Lord comes down to explain to us our Strange and misunderstood life in this mystery Babylon that we are living in and they s a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book and to open the C thereof thou was slain and has redeemed us to God the relationship between God and man by that blood out of Kindred that Nimrod has set up us as and tongues which n did and people which n did and Nations as n did yes because Nimrod came and said you are Americans you are Mexicans you are congales you are Africans and you are and all these things that we have seen sure but now when the book is open when it is really open not just preaching it like oh we are we are we are no when you are truly open the book is truly open now you said Lord you have redeemed us you have redeemed us I used to look at myself with complex I look look at to look at myself as something big and all these things here the the Prophet come say he said that body of yours it's just few cents that body of yours that you try like you know to expose with short skirts and trying to seduce men and try all these things here said like it's few cents and the day they lay down there in the coffin nobody all the all the all the requests that you were getting you not getting them anymore all these things that we see in the world in Africa in in Asia anti-Semitism and colors and all this at the end of The Journey brother bam says the time that death is about at your door all that will become D to you he said that he will knock that out of your mind but but but you see you see those who are called to be under God's Vision like Judas that Jesus called by name but the Love of Money the love of power the desire for being something better something great he still held onto it like like like Cain God tells him do like your brother look at that brother over there look at that sister over there God gives you examples we are are surrounded by a cloud of witnesses people who fight this battle day and night he gives you people around you but you're still there like you know just we understand we understand but then what does he do you have redeemed us and verse 10 and he has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth the thing that the disciples were looking for come on who should be accounted for greatest who should Reign who should re he said I am showing you a better way I am showing you want to rain this is the way to follow you need to be a king you need to be a priest this is the halfway I jesus must dwell in you that's the importance of receiving the Holy Ghost not just to preach it not just to say that I belong to a certain church but to really be inside of that church to be born into that word yes sir and to be born into that word is God in human flesh because he has seen it you have seen it done with the prophet you have seen it done with Daddy you have seen it done with Mommy and he also wants to do it with you right God wants to do that and he is knocking at the door because at the end of the third Sabbath he was set outside of the church he said behold I knock behold I knock and while is knocking you may have already probably oh brother I've received the prophet it's been the message it's been 50 years yes but brother Bram also preaches the message doors in door right he wants to get in there too I know really this year nobody knows but I need to get in there yeah it's not a public show nobody wants to know that nobody will come to know that not even the preacher will know but him in you he knows that you have a door that you have to open and when he reveals it unto you that's where now your true nature will come forth that's right oh I've received the uh a new spirit you know I get along now with everybody but that's not the point I will give you a new spirit and I'll give you my spirit because in the heart there's no mental faculty for you to think with but as a man thinketh in his heart so is he and that thinking is not you thinking but it is him thinking in you and that's what he wants to do and by by him coming into you now he makes you now Kings and Priests because he said behold I am among you I am serving you you call me master you call called me King but now I want to get into you and as I'm getting into you since I am the king of kings I will be a king in you then you also become the king you want to become a priest then receive Jesus Christ in your heart let him get into every single portion of your life let him transform all your being let him be The Cloud of Glory not in the picture but in the heart let it be God made flesh again today let it be the one that we are Desiring to see once again in this last day let it be the one that the world nature is looking to see the manifestation what is manifestation God in you the hope of glory we are looking for a glory this is the glory of God we are looking for the Temple of Solomon this is the Temple of Solomon we are looking for what God is doing in this last day this is what God is doing in this last day God made flesh in human flesh in human heart you might be the one the craziest one we know but when God comes in he tames all your hunger he tames all your ideas he quitness all the things because when he woke up in the boat he said see be still even if your life is all rugged all that you can think of but then when he comes in amen everything is at peace that's why when he comes down today he says Shalom am he say shalom to the church Shalom to your bride because you have received it and as you are receiving it it's not a slogan he wants you to be out there amen I don't think I'll be to finish the message but I think we'll be probably close here God himself he's looking to come and let bring him in in our lives so that as this is working you can look and say that it is not I that liveth but it is Christ in me every single day amen may God bless you amen can you say Amen to that yes sir I start getting excited when you begin to see the word as it was made manifest comes clear to you and it makes you humble doesn't make you stuffed shed and proud and arrogant no show me humility let's Stand Together God bless you all this evening I've got to run I've got brother Brian Naidu is showing up
