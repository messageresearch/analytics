service in you in your hands of Father tonight may you come and speak through me and hear through my brothers and sisters may your garden cleanse us and through the preaching of the word of Jesus tonight we have many needs in the land of God and even though a brother had prayed for them oh God and we still have to pray again oh God we need to bring these needs in your presence for you to minister to those needs of Father you do know what each and every one of them are going through Jesus even this night oh God we remember our pastor as he will be ministering to the service of Father funeral service for our brother guinean retief that has gone on beyond the curtain of time of Father we want you to put the words of encouragement and the words of consolation in his mouth and for him

those prayers of Father we can't wait to see him here in the church to be dedicated or father be with us tonight as we go through the scriptures bless us oh God and take full charge in full control of the service this is in Jesus name we pray amen thank you musicians you know I kind of questioning myself are you thinking the musicians each and every single time you go to the pulpit sometimes you forget and it's not good they're doing a wonderful job you know they need to be uh yeah to thank them and recognize what they are doing shall we read some scriptures in Psalms chapter 34 Verse seven the angel of the Lord encompassed around about them that fear Him and delivereth them shall we read Psalm 91 it's a lengthy reading but uh preferred to start with verse 9. Psalm 91 verse 9 to verse 12. because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation they shall know evil before thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou Dash thy food against the stone we have more to read but for now you can have your seat as God is blessing in the reading of his word I kind of fell to go in the same direction I've been going talking about angels in the ministry of angels because we still have some other things to talk about seems like the nail was not seems to we need to cinch it and make it uh hold tight the uh someone tonight so uh the summons uh title tonight is uh Angelic realm and the ministry of angels part two and for the subject I take can you hear your theophany calling you pray for me and you pull is on and be administering the message that we have received you and I is All About Angels from there constellation of the stars in the sky three of them lining up to the birth of the messenger of this hour William Branham is All About Angels those three stars that lined up in constellation in a constellation it seems like I was Jesus being born again but this is the ministry of Jesus Christ that was about to take place on the Earth because remember the Capstone to cap off the pyramid is Jesus Christ himself because if you see this Cloud that has come in 1963 it's seven angels that have formed the pyramid itself so that Capstone head to feet it has to have a part that will fit exactly so that's the ministry of Jesus Christ that's supposed to be there to feed the Capstone that's why the minutes of Jesus of William Branham has to be exactly the ministry of Jesus Christ no wonder people consider him as Jesus himself some of them are worshiping him as a god so that the uh the light on the crib of the newborn was the same light that led the children of Israel from Egypt unto the Palestine 1916. when he was seven years old parking the water from the the well on his way going back home he heard a voice he saw Whirlwind around the tree a voice came out came out of the Whirlwind and talking to him do not defy your body do not smoke or drink because I have a job to do with you when you get older 1933 while baptizing the 17th person in the Ohio River a light came up again in the sky The Voice came out of that light and telling him as the John the Baptist foreign the first coming of Jesus Christ you have a Ministry that will run the second coming of Jesus Christ 1946 we can talk even about 1950 in Texas Houston while he was preaching they took a picture of that pillow fire that was hanging above him brothers and sisters we are serving a living God it's not in historical God but he's a living God we are in the Bible here in in a new testament our fathers when they were in the upper room after they prayed the same purify came down and subdivised it hangover each and every one of them exactly like William Branham the fire was on All Above him and God even allowed the picture to be taken because he knew the age we are living in this is a scientific age this is the age of imagination he knew people would be looking they'll be able to look and see the symbol of fire that's the form that God took when he started to create Heaven and the Earth 1946 while he was praying for his ministry in the cave because he had a burden about his ministry this life this light in his life this Angel following him all along his life when he was telling people about their lives and visions and things religious people they start talking about it in a bad way they said this is of the devil he was hesitant he didn't know what to do but he did the right thing to go talk to the Creator in heaven himself amen he went to the cave and started talking to God as he was praying he said the light came in the room and then here I want to say something because 1946 that's the same year where Israel was rushed into his homeland there's something to talk about here and the brother bottom says the same meal the same month in June the angel of the Lord came to him in the cave why because we are in the Book of Ruth where Naomi was going back to her Homeland her two daughters have lost their their husbands which were her sons and hell she lost her her husband too and More in moabite so as she was going back she told her daughters-in-law I don't have any sons I don't have sons I don't have any husband you need to stay to your Homeland she kind of backslided and she stayed but Ruth decided to go with Naomi she said I'll go for you your God will be my God your land will be my land so what does that mean it means that at the same time Israel which is the type of Naomi going back to the Homeland this is this is Ruth which we are Gentile we're going back Naomi to be Redeemed by the kingsman Redeemer and asked to be married to the same boss which is our Lord Jesus Christ in 1963 finally the cloud was formed as those seven angels formed the cloud the pyramid to bring Jesus Christ down here on the Earth this is to cap off the pyramid this is the Capstone to cap off the pyramid because in the east in Egypt Enoch's pyramid was not capped off he said the reason why they didn't cap off the uh the pyramid because the Capstone was rejected right Jesus was rejected in the east so as you see what about I'm kind of explained it when he took a a US dollar bill when he flipped over the US dollar bill he showed there was a pyramid there with the Capstone on the top he said these things have uh spiritual application to it because this is West Coast in the east coast in in in the East they didn't cap off the the Capstone the uh the pyramid but in the west coast here in America the pyramid had a cup Stone which means in the East when God came down for the first time in um in uh in in Israel in the time of Moses he came down to talk to the people where they asked Moses could we talk to that God and God asked Moses to prepare the people and to come to the mountain the mountain was the Mount Sinai which means the mountain of the Sun rising and then here we are in the west coast in America in Arizona to the sunset Mountain this is where the Capstone has to come to cap off that pyramid and this is the time we are living in so all along his life brother Branham veiled this big beings which is God himself in his life God allowed even the uh mediums to see that light and she talked about it she told William Branham about that light but religious people they took it as of the devil that's why he went to pray and God showed him I know many of us have uh heard him talking about this light when he was giving his testimony he said this is the same pillow fight that laid the children visa for me jumped onto the Palestine and when when the angel came to him in the cave he started quoting the Bible to give him confidence and then when he started complaining about his uh education he said I won't be able to attract people I'm not educated the angel said I will be with you tonight this is again the Angelic Ministry the very Ministry of William Branham is to turn us back to the Faith of Our Fathers what was the Faith of Our Fathers they had the new birth which means the revelation of Jesus Christ the new birth is when you have the revelation of who is Jesus Christ I want to talk a little bit here about the connection of the revelation of Jesus Christ and the new birth in Genesis 1 verse 26 God says let us create a man like unto us like in our image it seems like God is talking to someone else because he said let us make a man but he was not talking to somebody else was talking to himself as a he has a many attributes was talking to his attributes because he has to be a father a son a savior he was talking to his attributes God is Spirit the Bible says and those that worship him that must worship Him in truth and in spirit let us make Command in our likeness in our image who is God Spirit word and flesh demand that God has to create uh has to create it has to be follow the same pathway spirit soul I'm Spirit word and flesh but in the message of who is this Melchizedek says we skipped the theophany the body word God has put us in these bodies to to be tempted because in this form of the word we would know everything if we had come through following the normal pathway would have got into this theophany in the body world we have known everything and therefore would have hindered some God's program to be performed that's why God put us directly into this bodies to be tempted and what I'm says one time means it's in the Bible Moses wanted to see him I want to see the form I want to see you and God hid Moses into the Rock as he was passing by Moses said I saw it was like a back of a human being and what about them says he was coming down gradually he came into a flesh of a human being before even he came into the body of Jesus Christ remember of that Melchizedek who didn't have any father any mother beginning of the days or end of the days he was coming down gradually until one day he was born we need to remember that life comes here on the earth three ways Adam came here on the earth a full man God formed him and put the soul in him and he was born in the Kingdom Jesus Christ came here on the Earth he was birthed by a woman but an angel came and spoke the word and the spirit of God came to vivified or to leave to give life to the uh words and Jesus was born Jesus Christ Adam didn't have to be born again because they were born in the Kingdom but the rest of us after the scene after the fall we are born outside of the Kingdom that's why we need to be born again because Jesus Christ said unless the man is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God to be born of water no Spirit that's how Jesus was born water talks about the word and the spirit of God himself that's when Nicodemus came to ask and how can a man that is born already a big and grown-up man and go back to the womb of his mother and be born again he didn't understand that concept and Jesus Christ said that which born of the spirit is a spirit and that which born which is born of flesh's Flesh born again man it's like a wind that is blowing you don't know which way it's coming and you don't even know which way it's going it's exactly like Jesus Christ when he died and he rose again when those two disciples were talking about him going to the to immense he joined them the way he came in they didn't see him when he talked to them in the house after he broke the braid when they recognized him he disappeared the way he went they didn't know let's read the prophet here in uh in the message of Hebrews chapter 4 1957. he say this as we had it the other night God in the beginning was spirit and then from God went out the logos or the theophany which was a form of a man called the son of God he came in the earth in a body of Flesh even before he came in Jesus Christ now swallow that once brother I will prove it to you when Moses saw him he said let me see your form Lord and God hid him in the rock and when he passed by he said it was the back part of a man that was the theophany it's exactly then that theophany had to be made flesh not another person but the same person had to come to become flesh to take this thing out of the death like a bee when it stings it leaves a stinger and he never left that he could put a sting in a human flesh because it's sin but brother when his tongue the immanuel's flesh he lost the Stinger yes sir he can pause but he ain't got no Stinger no more so I need you to give you to give me your undivided attention because I'm trying to go somewhere here this theophany that we skipped that's where we have to go back to that's the reason why we come to church that's the reason why we read the word because the new birth is with water and spirit when we talk about the water it's the word we're talking about the spirit that's the holy spirit that the spirit of God and that's your theophany and what about them says sometimes you feel like full of joy what is that because you are bumping into your theophany guess what family your birth until your death or the Rapture if we have to leave this world by those two means you be protected because God gave charge to the angels to protect you the Bible says in all your ways no wonder we heard here about the brothers that were in a car accident thank God that nothing happened to them guess what Angels were given charge to watch over them now this minister of William Branham as I said is to bring us back to the Faith of Our Fathers our fathers had the revelation of who Jesus was because one day he questioned them who do you say that I am May the son of man they start talking about other people they say you are Jeremiah you are not no no not about them you what do you say about me and Peter had that Revelation he said you are the son of living God Jesus Christ knew that it has to be with the Revelation directly coming from above right because what John what Peter said was something that could only revealed to a human being by God himself because here out of God out of the Spirit came out the logos nobody knew these things nobody has seen these things until that day when God revealed it to Peter and that's the foundation even of the church and that's the new birth why the new birth because we have to be God became us and we have to become him Spirit theophany body words and in the flesh we came from Spirit in this body but we have to catch up go back into our theophany be birthed in the Kingdom because we're birthed outside of the Kingdom our fathers knew who they were does the identification not only who God is Not only who Jesus was but who they are themselves the question John the Baptist who do you say you are because the Pharisees and services has sent us to ask you of who you are tell us he didn't say um the son of Elizabeth in Zechariah no I'm The Voice in the wilderness but as I the same question might be questioned to you tonight who are you even though you know your parents but as a Believer You Should Know Who You Are William Branham when he came here on the earth he knew his ministry he knew where he comes from in the Bible Malachi 4. that's the Faith of Our Fathers they knew who they were they knew who God was they had the awareness of Angels or Angelic Realm when Peter was in the prison because Herod was killing their disciples it was killing one after another Peter was arrested and put in jail the time was getting nigh for him to be killed but the Faith of Our Fathers they had a dedicated life they had a life of consecration that's why they were gathering somewhere praying for Peter and as they were praying God dispatched an angel in the prison the angel came to free Peter and when Peter got out of the prison as barabaram says hit here let's read in uh Hebrews chapter 3 1957. let's just read uh highlighted portion to save the time so they opened the door she said it's Peter they said oh oh my he's dead that's his angel standing there see done God in his glorified body you know that theophany remember how we took it the big diamond and how it reflected the light how it went back through there this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting and they thought Peter then died and this old body had dropped and they'd buried it in a few days and he had entered into his angel or his glorified not glorified body but in his theophany the body that's already prepared he had had a knowledge of theophany that's why the Bible says in uh Matthew chapter 18. verse 10 I believe the Bible says this Matthew 18 chapter 18 verse 10 take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for I say unto you that in heaven their Angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven that's our ethiophen is they thought Peter was dead and his Angel which is his theophany was at the door but what you forgot to what you didn't know was if he was in his body in his theophany he could not knock it at all he would have just walked through they recognize the voice like the prophet of God recognized the voice of the angel regardless of the form that angel was taking but still William Branham was aware of that voice because when he spoke to him in the cave he said I knew it was the same voice that spoke to me all along you might be old in this body might be weak but the voice still the same we can recognize by The Voice remember my own mom when she died she was in her 70s when I was talking to her I heard the voice that I was here but when I put the picture to the voice was totally different but the lady said that was Rhoda she said that's Peter and he was knocking no that's his angel that his theophany no that's him and when he came in Peter related I told him what had happened to him in the prison he said I was freed and I knew because he didn't understand how he got out of prison when when God does something for you it's always Supernatural we cannot understand that right away it takes a time for you to realize what happened to me was a hand of God because our fathers they had the the the faith of our heart or our fathers they had the awareness of angels because Peter said now I know that the Lord has sent his Angel to free me from the prison because in in the Psalm 34 the Bible says the angel of God Encompass all around us and he delivers those that fear Him that's why Jesus Christ left the glory like Abraham left one side of the land to the other side of the land to free lot his nephew Jesus Christ left to Glory came down here on the earth and even way down in hell to free those that feared him in those days when they were alive they died in faith and he came down from Glory came down here on the earth went down in hell he freed them because they feared him says he didn't say everybody come out of the Tomb when he came to bring Lazarus to life he said Lazarus that's why the constellation of seven angels he has come down to free us and to get us out of the allowed this year out of the darkness of this end time out of sins no wonder people they don't argue about the rest of the uh the the seals it's only the seventh seal that's the devil because he doesn't want us to recognize the Creator angel that has come down in this end time to free us to give us freedom our fathers behave the consecrated life as I said when Peter was in the prison and came together God bless you brother Robert he had a revelation first of if I bring this prayer requests to the church to the congregation to be prayed for it and I believe God will do a miracle and you've read in the Bible the Bible says a constant prayers were offered for Peter was not one time prayer was constantly amen amen we should not stop praying for Josiah we keep praying until we see him here being dedicated not even there we still have to pray for him all along his life not only him all the children all the brothers and sisters we should have this because this is what the message of William Branham has done to bring us back to that faith where they had a dedicated life they had to pray for one another the prayers were had were heard by God in in heaven and an angel was sent into the prison same thing we can still pray for our brother in Mexico in prison we can pray for any brother for any sister that sickness has put in the prison of sickness we can pray and God will send his Angel to free him for her from the sickness from whatever Condition You Are and with our fathers the angels knew them well even the addresses wherever they were living because Cornelius a man that feared God he was a man of prayers and one day when he was praying the angel came to him told him to send a man to go to Joppa the angel even gave him Precision of where the house where to find Peter was go by the seaside isn't that strange to see that the same angel in this end time when William Branham was praying for the sick have you heard him in the Deep College to the Deep he said you know what I'm waiting for I'm waiting for the angel and when that angel showed up he started talking to the sister he said I don't know you you don't know me but he knows you and he knows me like in the in the New Testament that angel knew who Peter was and he knew who Cornelius was and this the angel in the time of our fathers could direct the man sent by Cornelius to Peter could direct them to the very place where Peter was and the angels in this end time was talking to the woman giving even her address your name is Eva we're not serving a dead God we are in the Bible here says in the blind bath females 1956 is such a blessing here I was coming watch few hairs I had left on my head she said to me she said Billy she said you are getting bolted head honey and I said I know sweetheart but I haven't lost one of them she said what I said I haven't lost one she said where are they at and I said I tell you something sweetheart you might not know but if you tell me where they were or there was as he said before I got them I'll tell you where they are waiting for me to come to them they were somewhere is that right whatever they was they are waiting for me and I knew a new body is waiting there someday not only for me but all that love he's appearing I believe you are waiting for he's appearing that's right someday the old model will take away and Immortal will take its place the sorrows and the sickness and headache at heartache will fade away to a new body held forever and in the presence of God wouldn't that be wonderful then we we all have a big happy birthday won't we we just had one on Sunday well sister Solange biaya God bless your sweet heart we're going to have very soon a big birthday because we'll be birthed into the kingdom it's going to be a big birthday for everybody celebrate it forever until that time may God smile his riches blessings upon you upon all my beloved friends upon my critics upon all may God richest blessings rests on you so few years after this I know if I have to read this because it's a long reading again it looked like just a statement he made he was talking with his wife but little did we know it was a reality after some some years the man of God was laying down in his bed in his room and he started questioning himself William Branham now you are in your 50s seems like we haven't done much for the for the Lord we need to do something and The Voice start talking to him that's the same voice would you like to see beyond the curtain of time he say yeah I would like to to say such a thing let's read him here we're going to comment that later on but that morning when I felt something come over me and I thought usually like a vision comes and I looked I looked and I thought my what is this and I looked at Greek Green Hill a great Green Hills and young woman just coming from everywhere by the tens of thousands and thousands of thousands and they were all coming long hair hanging down they back white the long hair hanging down their back white robes on barefooted screaming hollering our brother I thought now this is strange and I turned back around and I looked and there I laid right there and there was my wife laying there on the bed and I said now you know what I died I say that's what happened I've died and I said I might have had heart attack or something I've died there lays my body so I want to say something here this is two bodies this is these are two men the one in the bed was a main bone of a woman the one here in the glory of was a man born of a spirit and what about them says in the man I'm going ahead of myself he said the body the flesh is the Veil is preventing us to see beyond the curtain of time the flesh is the Veil this side is the main bone of a woman with short of Life full of misery agitated all the time he he had fear of knife even knives because he said I'm glad I wasn't living in the days where they used to use the sword and he was afraid to die because Barbara says I was afraid to die because I didn't know where I was going to be am I going to be a spirit I thought when we die I'm going to be a spirit and another brother will pass by and I will pass by in two spirits I might drop something here again you know when angels in heaven when they lost those that have been deceived by Lucifer when they lost the Angelic bodies they became spirit lying Spirit remember of that lying Spirit when God was having a a a meeting was looking the ways to cause the the words of the Prophet to be fulfilled he could not send an angel there because those angels with him they can only say the truth they could not say a lie that's why he was looking for what should I do and the spirit Came From Hell that used to be an angel with a body now doesn't have a body is a spirit a lying spirit what are you gonna do I'm gonna dwell in the prophet and the cause the king to believe the lie that's what about him says your pastor behind the secret desk is an angel of God all the pastors and ministers behind the sacred desk that can only tell the truth because they are angels of the Lord because those angels could not say the true the LIE and then God is the god of Holy Spirit he can use the devil as a whip to correct us and what about him says I was afraid to die because I was going to become a spirit but little did he know because he said I was afraid of this because he saw the reality he said is this a vision try to bite his fingers real a man born of a man in a man born of a woman laying down there because when we go beyond the king of time we are we are outside of this Veil and we can see like our brothers and sisters are beyond the those that have gone on they can see us but we cannot see them because we're still in this Veil because William Branham could see that body that body was just still laying down there didn't know nothing he looked at the body still laying there he looked at all the claws and everything was there he could see that but that body could not see him the veil of the flesh that's why we need to we don't have to give it the means for it to give to fight us because the very enemy of William Branham is William Branham himself we're going back to Earth and he said this and there I was looking I thought there was there was my wife there's everything there's my shirt hanging there on that bed post and I thought here I am I looked around I looked around again and these women were all coming and they were I looked coming this way and they come my brothers all genuine all of them looked to be to be young man so people that are talking about the dressing special sisters the dressing so you have the answer here when he went to in heaven he gave the description of how the sisters dressed long hair robe right and then he gave the description of hell makeup when they passed by him the there was just they just make up and dressing or immoral way you know now you have two pictures you know you can make a decision of which one you want to do to build a reflection of of Heaven or Hell you have two pictures here they screaming our precious brother why I didn't know what to think I thought this is strange I looked back I wasn't old man I was young now that man laying down there has a bolded hair head and this one here was young full of hair because he told honey I haven't lost one of my hair wherever they were before I got them they are there waiting for me few years after that he got them he seems to be funny but this is the reality I thought this is strange thing I thought is this vision I bite my finger and I thought no the kind of vision I've had and then there is something begin to talk to me up here and said you have entered in with your people that's the same voice that talk to him all along the the uh all these brenhams he said they are your converts to Christ are you the convert to Christ for and these women I know have always been considered kind of they call me a woman header so well I'm not because I believe see I don't like you moral indecent I like real genuine Sisters in Christ amen which you are our father they had the knowledge of the theophany like I said to as I'm going to the end of the service here in this end time we are called to a new consecration and to a deep dedication and we have to be one without theophany and to live eternally in our glorified body to get to that point because the Faith of Our Fathers are described here how they used to live whether it was a prayer life was the love among them was the awareness of the supernatural the awareness of God himself we need to come up higher in the realm of angels with great expectation this is for this Supernatural to take place and this is the time for these realities see angels all our life long will have angels one time Philip I mean the eunuch Ethiopians were he was reading searching the scriptures he wanted to know what was Isaiah talking about was here about himself about somebody else the Bible said bless those that are Hunger of the truth right and the angel looked and he saw Philip that's why we are called the mystical body of Jesus Christ the body when your toe has a problem your finger your hand will go down try to help your eyes will look way to go to the hospital so that's this is the body so God knows which part of the body to call and send to solve the problem Philip come up here go down there go close to the chariot and he found that unique Ethiopian struggling with the scriptures did you understand what you're reading about I don't know nobody so he had a deep hunger of the reality God send us the angel you yourself you might be an angel of God to go give warnings to people give you know blessings to people that's why we need to be aware of the supernatural of the spiritual realm and be in prayer for more because we don't know what time and what day the Lord will need you when men sinned in in Genesis the Bible say they put the the angel with the Flaming sword tried to prevent Adam and Eve to go touch the tree of life because God didn't want them to live eternally in sin and then now this in the now here after the coming of the Lord now these ministers behind the secret desk they are the angel of God with the two-edged sword the word of God pushing you to enter into and to have the uh the Tree of Life those one prevented the men to go touch the tree of life because in that condition they could not touch the Tree of Life to Live eternally insane but these angels here with the two aged sword they are pushing you to have the Tree of Life that's the ministry of angels we need to be aware of the Angels deep dedication that's why I call it a new consecration because they were in consecration back then for many years people didn't have such a consecration until this end time where this message has been sent to us to send us back to that Faith where we have to have the same Consecration and dedication as they used to have this is my prayer tonight as we stand to our feet musician why don't you make a way this is my prayer for this year to be dedicated to the Lord to consecrate ourselves to the Lord to be aware of angels because they are charged to keep us they are charged to give warning to us because remember when Joseph in his heart he was planning to get rid of Mary the angel saw that during the night time the angel came and told him don't do such a thing the angel of the Lord will be sent to you when you are about to make a mistake because the major eyes after they got lost the law striking the stars the star that was was leading them disappeared they ended up being in a wrong place the angel came telling them don't go back the same way an angel of God was saying to give a warning to Joseph when Mary was pregnant with the Lord go into Egypt because the governor politics they want to kill the child [Music] The Book of Job says God talks in many ways sometimes in Visions when we are laying down we are sleeping give warnings to us send you an angel and he knows how to talk to us sometimes he comes during the night time where we are sleeping sometimes literally he'll send somebody a brother a sister regardless of the form he will take but you need to be aware say like Peter I know the Lord has sent his angel to deliver me because the Bible says the angel of the Lord Encompass all around those that fear him and he'll deliver them they are being given charge to watch over you as I said from your birth until you're living of this Earth either by Rapture or by Death nobody knows when nobody knows when you're going to die nobody knows when you're going to be in ruptured it depends on the Lord but until then we need to be aware of angels we need to come up higher in the realm of Revelation and vision we don't have to keep it as a routine come to church go home come to church go home no this message has come to bring us up higher [Music] because we need to catch up remember without theophany the theophone is influencing you come up higher go to church read pray because that's the body word remember we're birthed outside of the Kingdom we need to be birthed into the kingdom to understand it that's the new birth [Music] and for that to happen we need to know who Jesus is because when we know who he is then we'll become like him who is he he's the word because he was spirit he condensed himself into the body world and then in this form you'll know everything remember Daniel says in the end time the knowledge will be increasing [Music] that knowledge is the knowledge of the word of God when you read the message you will know a lot of things this is a word we need to go back to catch up without theophany is pulling us we don't have to be afraid no more when we die we have a body waiting for us William Brown was afraid but after he crossed the curtain of time when he went beyond the curtain of time when he crossed the divided line he realized I was afraid for no reason [Music] deep consecration [Music] new Consecration and dedication it's not the message to keep us here on the Earth is the message to take us home do you know William Branham is our alienser [Music] there's something here that I'm about to say but it's going to be helpful it's not some you know some Doctrine but it's something that might be helpful to you he helped me before you go read even tonight or some other time when you have the time in the Book of Genesis 24 [Music] from verse 62 that's when Isaac left his home was coming in the field at the same time a laser with Rebecca they were coming [Music] in verse 63 Isaac was in the field and when you are in the field is just the head [Music] and Rebecca questioned Elisa who's that man that coming across our pathway she didn't know Isaac Elias is the one that knows Isaac our elieza of this end time William Branham he knows but that's why he told us this picture of Offman looks like the Jesus that I always see in the vision he's the one that saw him 63 64 65 that's verse I'm talking about the chapter 24. chapter 65 done Eliezer decreased Isaac increased and he took Rebecca into the tent of his mother the tent where [Music] Sarah was changed see God is in the numbers 1963 that's how our Isaac came in the sky what is that clouds we told William Branham turned the picture to the right side and he said that's your Isaac [Music] 1965 our Eleazar disappeared on this from the scene foreign and now we are walking in the sight of our Isaac we cannot be lost because we saw our Isaac has come all of this it takes deep consecration dedication we have all we need for our preparation because the bride prepares she's preparing herself we have whatever it takes he behooves us to have good courage to have the time to as Ruth to glean in the field of our boss shove our heads father God so thankful Our Father for your presence sometimes my thing will bring [Music] the service in our way the way we prepared it when you are the almighty God and who knows the needs of your people and who knows how to direct us and what to say and what not to say
