[23:04] because I learn more about
[23:07] him and to know him is to love him amen
[23:13] um this coming Sunday I'll be preaching
[23:15] for about 30 minutes or so about a space
[23:21] of a half
[23:22] hour but uh what we're going to do is uh
[23:26] this is going to be the time of brother
[23:29] Neil moer to give his his testimony of
[23:32] what God has done in his life and we
[23:34] have videos we have slides and it's
[23:37] going to be the first time that we have
[23:39] done this presentation and so I want all
[23:42] of you to come here uh I'm sure you're
[23:45] going to be blessed by it and you many
[23:47] of you probably have no idea what he's
[23:50] gone
[23:52] through probably no idea um we are going
[23:55] to take the vote on our deacons and and
[23:58] trustees that have been in position now
[24:00] for uh a year and a half or so so we
[24:03] will be uh taking a vote on this Sunday
[24:07] also the technicians here my sound
[24:10] technicians brother Ruben and his team
[24:13] um and brother Ethan they have told me
[24:15] that um every time we have translations
[24:19] we're going to we have the possibility
[24:21] now to record it and then to put it on
[24:24] the archives so that you could listen to
[24:27] French or Burundi Spanish whatever
[24:29] because if we have it translated even if
[24:32] it's only for one or two here there are
[24:35] others I'm sure that perhaps at home
[24:38] that would love to hear it in French or
[24:40] in Spanish so praise the Lord I saw last
[24:42] Sunday when I went by do you know these
[24:44] are the three translation booths right
[24:47] here if you if you don't know and they
[24:49] can look through the window and look at
[24:50] me or they have a monitor in front of
[24:52] them headphone with a microphone and
[24:55] they can look out and see me or watch it
[24:57] on the um
[24:58] on the screen but I've also uh told my
[25:03] translators that you need to be as
[25:05] anointed as the speaker and you must be
[25:08] consecrated before God so that when you
[25:11] come and you know you come before
[25:14] service prayed up and have the notes if
[25:17] the minister has got uh the scriptures
[25:20] you want to be able to have the
[25:21] scriptures so you if you're translating
[25:25] you just don't you want to be prepared
[25:27] in other words it's there before you
[25:28] we're going to go to 1 Corinthians 5
[25:31] chapter uh you know and what verses and
[25:34] then if there's quotes of the Prophet
[25:36] you want to be able to read those Len
[25:39] I'm just saying this out loud so that
[25:41] you understand anyone who does the
[25:43] translation because uh if there's a
[25:46] quote of the Prophet you want to be able
[25:48] to as the minister is speaking it you
[25:51] want to be able to uh to say it also to
[25:54] translate it and as you all know that
[25:57] there are in uh in every language there
[25:59] are certain words that perhaps uh might
[26:03] be hard to translate and so the
[26:05] translator would look at that and then
[26:07] he could go ahead and maybe uh in his
[26:10] word dictionary or on some kind of an
[26:12] app hey what does this word mean uh in
[26:16] French or in Burundi or in Spanish or
[26:19] whatever and uh uh so that would be good
[26:22] so I'm looking forward to that I think
[26:25] that uh all of this uh effort that we
[26:28] have been doing for
[26:30] years um we've just done it and when
[26:34] they're finished we didn't have any
[26:35] archive recording we're going to be
[26:38] doing that in fact tonight James love
[26:40] all as far as I know they told me
[26:42] tonight is our
[26:44] inauguration of doing it uh French and
[26:48] doing a live
[26:50] translation uh and uh everything and so
[26:53] uh during the service they're going to
[26:55] come tap me on the shoulder and I'm
[26:58] going to go back and listen also to hear
[27:01] because I'm
[27:02] interested um I want that if we're going
[27:05] to do an effort let's do it whatever you
[27:08] do do ask unto the Lord and do it with
[27:10] your whole heart amen uh and uh there's
[27:13] nothing worse than having a monotone
[27:18] translator the the the minister mind
[27:21] praise God God is a good god uh PR God
[27:26] God is a good god
[27:28] and and hey flat no no no n hey um I
[27:33] think one of the best translators I ever
[27:36] had was brother Gordon tutani from uh
[27:39] Zimbabwe in shaa and let me tell you if
[27:43] I emphasized a certain word he did if I
[27:45] raise my hand he did he was just uh and
[27:50] um there are certain words that if you
[27:52] don't know it's good to to know them and
[27:54] I
[27:56] even this is me when I go overseas is I
[28:00] give my
[28:01] translator my scriptures and I said have
[28:05] it marked in your Bible you guys see
[28:06] these yellow markers here I said you
[28:09] have it marked in your Bible so if you
[28:11] say go to uh Ephesians 4 uh your
[28:14] translator going hold on here a second I
[28:17] know it's in here uh what was that uh
[28:20] what what what the chapter no no
[28:23] no go let's go let's do it and do it
[28:27] with our our whole heart and so anyway
[28:30] giv a little pep talk to all our
[28:32] translators and uh so tonight I believe
[28:35] brother James we're going to be doing
[28:37] that I think I think if everything is
[28:40] going well uh we'll do it so I said
[28:43] James you you are uh the first one that
[28:46] we're going to be doing and then we will
[28:48] archive this and put it uh there so
[28:51] others around the world can listen and
[28:55] if they don't speak English they can get
[28:57] it in a
[28:58] um uh in their language whatever
[29:01] language that we have translated well
[29:03] aren't you excited about that I am I
[29:05] think that hey I think that's wonderful
[29:07] I I see praise the Lord everything that
[29:09] we can
[29:10] do to make it easier and better for the
[29:15] people here at our church that's what we
[29:17] want to do amen and you all know that
[29:20] that when the reason that I archive and
[29:23] we live stream our services is for you
[29:27] in case you can't make it I'm not
[29:29] interested in trying to be a world
[29:32] Pastor uh and all of that and trying to
[29:35] see how many people in countries and
[29:38] different ones that would follow our
[29:39] ministry no it's for you it's for us and
[29:43] sometimes I say things very privately
[29:46] it's to our group brother Brenham would
[29:47] do that with Brenham Tabernacle now he
[29:50] says now you all know I'm speaking to my
[29:52] home church now he said I have to do a
[29:54] little uh maybe five-fold Ministry and
[29:57] uh work work him over a little bit and
[29:59] you know he said as an example he said
[30:01] well the last few weeks I've been going
[30:03] from house to house having to talk to
[30:06] the people because a little gossip a
[30:08] little something was going through the
[30:09] church and different things and so uh no
[30:12] matter what a a Vindicated Ministry of
[30:16] God that you would follow there are
[30:18] always little glitches and little things
[30:21] and um you know so it comes up in every
[30:24] Ministry and so I'm excited to be in
[30:27] church amen and I think on Wednesday
[30:29] nights if we're not careful what happens
[30:31] is we can drag a little bit and it's
[30:34] just church it's formal and yeah we're
[30:36] here and I'm I'm glad that you know and
[30:39] and hey but listen you realize and I
[30:42] told the brethren in the back room I
[30:43] said you
[30:45] realize that I said the Bible says where

[36:52] precious name amen and amen you love
[36:57] them this evening amen he's a good God
[37:01] if you have your
[37:02] Bibles let's turn to first Thessalonians
[37:05] 5 and
[37:08] 1 and Ephesians
[37:21] 6 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse one it
[37:26] says but of the time times and Seasons
[37:28] Brethren ye
[37:30] need ye have no need that I write unto
[37:33] you for yourselves know perfectly that
[37:36] the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief
[37:40] in the night what is Paul telling them
[37:42] here that I I don't need to tell you you
[37:45] already know you've already been
[37:52] taught for when they shall say peace and
[37:55] safety then sudden destruction cometh
[37:57] upon them as a travail of of a woman
[38:01] with child for they shall
[38:03] not
[38:06] escape and as you think of the travail
[38:09] of a woman there's no escaping that
[38:12] moment when it's upon you it's upon
[38:15] you and I can say that because you know
[38:19] even as we had our first child you begin
[38:21] to prepare very early and you're in this
[38:24] expectation you're in this excitement to
[38:27] have your first child in month in a
[38:29] month in advance you have the bags
[38:30] packed and you got that hospital bag and
[38:32] you're ready but then the second one
[38:35] came and he came early and we weren't
[38:40] ready and there's a different approach
[38:43] to it there's a different attitude
[38:45] that's true but yet let us not get slack
[38:48] am let us not get
[38:50] lazy for when the time comes it will be
[38:54] here there's no escaping it yes very
[38:57] good
[38:58] right but ye Brethren are not in
[39:03] darkness that that day should overtake
[39:05] you as a thief ye are children of the
[39:08] light and the children of the day we are
[39:11] not of the night nor of Darkness
[39:13] therefore let us not sleep as do others
[39:16] but let us watch and be sober for they
[39:18] that sleep sleep in the night and they
[39:20] that be drunken are drunken in the night
[39:23] but let us who are of the day be sober
[39:26] putting on the bread breastplate of
[39:28] faith and of love and for a helmet the
[39:31] hope of
[39:32] salvation for God hath not appointed us
[39:35] unto wrath God has not appointed us unto
[39:39] wrath we have a p purpose we have an
[39:43] appointment with him but he hasn't
[39:45] appointed us to wrath we are children of
[39:48] the light and because we are children of
[39:50] the light but that doesn't mean that we
[39:52] won't go through Dark
[39:55] Places that doesn't mean that we won't
[39:57] go through dark trials true but we are
[40:00] children of the light and for God hath
[40:03] not appointed us unto wrath but obtain
[40:06] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ let's
[40:10] go over to Ephesians
[40:12] 6 and verse
[40:15] 10 very familiar scripture
[40:22] here Ephesians 6 and10 says finally my
[40:25] brethren be strong in the Lord
[40:28] and in the power of his mind put on the
[40:31] whole armor of God that you may be able
[40:33] to stand against the Ws of the devil the
[40:37] Ws the tricks the deceptions of the
[40:40] devil for we wrestle not against flesh
[40:42] and blood but against principalities and
[40:45] Powers against rule the rulers of the
[40:48] darkness of this world against spiritual
[40:51] wickedness in high places you can have
[40:54] your seats this evening now we want to
[40:57] continue on in the same direction and
[41:00] the Lord kind of dealt with us in a
[41:02] different way but it's going to be the
[41:06] same thought but we just changed our
[41:07] title here but we know that God dubsta
[41:10] tells his word that everything we can
[41:13] continue a thought and it can go on and
[41:15] on and on and as brother Mario
[41:17] ministered and brother Ron ministered
[41:19] and you can see a thought in the channel
[41:21] that God would
[41:22] use and we know that as a minister would
[41:26] preach in sermons would go forth that
[41:29] you must identify and you must discern
[41:31] in which that what that minister is
[41:33] speaking to because he will minister to
[41:37] you but then he's also in a way he's
[41:39] speaking either to your to to your flesh
[41:42] man or he's speaking to your your spirit
[41:45] and then you'll have sermons that he
[41:46] comes and he and he preaches pre
[41:48] predestination and an election and
[41:51] choosing and all these and you begin to
[41:53] see that he's ministering unto the soul
[41:56] into your soul so you have have to
[41:58] discern the direction in which he's
[42:00] taken
[42:02] you so this evening for a
[42:06] title I'm going to take the hindrance
[42:08] the hindrances of your
[42:11] identity good and a subject of mending
[42:14] Broken
[42:15] Spirits amen mending Broken Spirits so
[42:18] we see that we have hindrances all
[42:21] around us anything can be a hindrance
[42:23] for us and they might vary from person
[42:26] to person person right something that
[42:30] might bother me might not bother you
[42:32] something that I struggle with you might
[42:34] not struggle with something that hinders
[42:36] me might not hinder
[42:38] you and by definition hindrance is the
[42:41] state of being interfered with held back
[42:44] slow down the state of being
[42:48] hindered a person or a thing that
[42:50] interferes with or slows down the
[42:52] progress of someone or something
[42:58] hindrances can be physical it can be
[43:00] mental they can come spiritually and as
[43:03] we read that we wrestle not against
[43:05] flesh and blood but against
[43:07] principalities and Powers rulers of the
[43:13] darkness we know that the prophet would
[43:16] teach us that there would be
[43:18] Dimensions we're living in the realm of
[43:20] many dimensions and in the countdown he
[43:23] would say he says
[43:25] now he says we know that there are
[43:28] there's another dimension which is the
[43:29] fourth dimension because science has
[43:32] probed into it and found it and it is
[43:35] the radio there's no senses of our body
[43:38] that can detect radio or Television over
[43:41] that ether wave yet right through us now
[43:44] is coming people's voices right through
[43:47] here is coming television pictures but
[43:50] we have nothing in us no way at all to
[43:53] contact that in ourselves it takes a
[43:56] crystal or some sort
[43:57] a magnet to contact
[44:00] that but it speaks that there's another
[44:02] D Dimension now that's the fourth
[44:06] dimension and we know that even within
[44:08] this room there's waves going radios
[44:11] picture shows and movies and all the
[44:14] these different channels the other day
[44:16] in our house we were we were eating
[44:18] dinner there in the in in the kitchen
[44:20] and and Nolan had a a toy radio in the
[44:23] front
[44:24] room and it's just a toy little toy
[44:27] radio all of a sudden we hear it going
[44:29] off yeah Roger that go ahead we're like
[44:31] what is
[44:32] that little did we know that it was
[44:34] picking up signal of somebody
[44:36] working in that area a little toy radio
[44:40] why because it's a receiver to something
[44:42] that's there we have all these things
[44:45] that are going through this room right
[44:47] now picture shows and movies and ball
[44:50] games and everything but yet we can't
[44:52] fill it with these senses
[44:57] but we have to have a
[44:59] device to tap into that realm we have
[45:02] some have to have a receiver in order to
[45:06] connect with that if we took a cell
[45:09] phone we all have a cell
[45:11] phone but if we took a cell phone this
[45:13] is a way that I can contact those the
[45:16] the YouTubes and the internets and
[45:17] everything that is going on within that
[45:19] realm we can't see it with our physical
[45:22] eyes right we don't know what's going on
[45:24] but it takes a receiver it takes a
[45:26] device to contact that
[45:28] realm yes come on it's no different than
[45:32] there's a a soundboard back
[45:36] there and it's per it's sending out a
[45:39] signal it's sending out a
[45:41] channel it's sending something out but
[45:44] there has to be a receiver on the other
[45:47] end in order to contact it in order to
[45:49] make have a purpose and those soundmen
[45:52] they find a channel that that doesn't
[45:54] have a bunch of voices it doesn't have a
[45:56] bunch of interference in it yeah in
[45:59] order for this microphone to
[46:03] work so I have the receiver on my end
[46:06] and it's traveling back to that
[46:07] soundboard which allows you to hear my
[46:10] voice right what happens if I mute my
[46:20] receiver
[46:23] now's there's interfer
[46:27] there's something interfering it there's
[46:28] something that's come between the
[46:30] connection
[46:32] right so in order for that channel to be
[46:36] open in the microphone for you to hear
[46:38] my voice there must be a channel yes sir
[46:41] there must be a a signal that you're
[46:45] receiving and each one of us has to
[46:48] become a receiver the holy spirit is no
[46:50] different the holy spirit is no
[46:53] different he's looking for somebody to
[46:54] be a receiver this evening not just just
[46:57] to sit on a church pew not just to come
[46:59] and show your attendance and say well I
[47:02] was in church and and I sat there and I
[47:04] raised my hands that's not what it's
[47:06] about but it's coming and being a
[47:08] receiver of what is going forth but you
[47:11] can't let a hindrance you can't let
[47:13] something in your life you can't let
[47:15] something come up because we're going to
[47:17] go through it we have hindrances within
[47:20] our lives within our
[47:23] minds hindrances within the spirit yeah
[47:27] of
[47:28] man that mess up the
[47:30] connection between you and
[47:34] God we're all a work in progress and no
[47:36] matter how long you go in this journey
[47:38] no matter how long you've been working
[47:41] walking this journey whether you're you
[47:43] know you just came into the world or
[47:45] you've been in this message all your
[47:47] life Satan's going to have hindrances
[47:50] that he's going to throw at you he's
[47:52] kind of going to try to deflect your
[47:54] identity and who you are
[47:59] and as I begin to think and study
[48:04] and there was something that came to
[48:06] me and it was have you hit your full
[48:10] potential ask him have you hit your full
[48:15] potential Wow have you hit that full
[48:18] potential you say well what are you
[48:19] talking about are you talking my
[48:21] personal
[48:22] walk being a husband being a wife being
[48:25] a son of God
[48:28] being a minister song leader whatever it
[48:31] is have you hit your full potential I'm
[48:33] talking about it all because it all
[48:36] intertwines one with the
[48:39] other and if you haven't hit your full
[48:42] potential why haven't you right what is
[48:45] hindering
[48:46] you what is holding you
[48:50] back are you too busy at work are you
[48:53] too busy in school are you too busy
[48:56] about the things of the world that you
[48:57] begin to become hindered to that channel
[49:00] that God is trying to speak to you very
[49:03] good and you're a receiver but yet
[49:06] there's an hindrance yes
[49:13] sir 1 John 1 and 5 says this is the
[49:17] message which we have heard of him and
[49:19] declare unto you that God is light and
[49:21] in him is no Darkness if we say that we
[49:24] have fellowship with him and walk in
[49:25] darkness we lie and do not the
[49:28] truth but if we walk in the light as he
[49:30] is in the light we have Fellowship one
[49:32] with the other and the blood of Jesus
[49:35] Christ how many's thankful for the blood
[49:38] there's still Power in the
[49:41] Blood and the blood of Jesus Christ his
[49:44] son cleanses us from all sin amen and if
[49:47] we say that we have no sin we deceive
[49:51] ourselves if you think that you're
[49:53] perfect and you're coming to church and
[49:55] you're faithful and you're doing the
[49:57] things and you you're just going through
[49:59] life and you have no sin because all
[50:02] have fallen short all have sinned and
[50:05] come short of the glory of
[50:07] God but yet each one of us have to Die
[50:11] daily yes sir we fall daily we have to
[50:14] Die
[50:18] daily we deceive ourselves and the truth
[50:20] is not in US you see remember the
[50:23] scripture we read of the Ws of the devil
[50:25] what is it to
[50:27] deception I remember a
[50:31] brother he had told me he said James
[50:34] I've gotten to a place in my Christian
[50:36] walk that I whenever I pray I I don't
[50:39] even need to pray for myself no more I
[50:42] just pray for everybody else I don't
[50:44] need no more pray you know I'm I'm
[50:46] focused on praying for everybody else
[50:48] and I said God you know within my heart
[50:51] I said don't ever let me get to that
[50:52] place because I want your help every
[50:55] single day amen I need to pray for
[50:57] myself daily I need God I need to
[51:00] surrender myself to you I need to walk
[51:02] with you I need your help I don't know
[51:04] what tomorrow holds but I Know Who Holds
[51:06] it and if we can surrender ourselves
[51:09] don't ever get to a place where you're
[51:12] you're
[51:13] comfortable because if you're
[51:15] comfortable you're stagnant you're
[51:18] staying
[51:21] still now notice brother
[51:25] brandom I begin to in study and I begin
[51:27] to look into the titles that brother
[51:30] Brandon would use of identification or
[51:32] or Christ identified through all the
[51:34] ages and he would preach 11 sermons on
[51:37] identification or God identified by all
[51:40] his
[51:41] characteristics identified Christ of all
[51:43] the ages I identified with
[51:47] Christ and he would preach us multiple
[51:50] times but what is he telling us in these
[51:52] sermons that he's the same yesterday
[51:54] today and forever as he began in the
[51:57] beginning and he began to condence in
[51:59] down and he began to transform and he
[52:01] began to show himself what is it it's
[52:03] the same Christ and you begin to look at
[52:07] you know the manifestations and as he
[52:09] would walk became man
[52:12] Jesus he says if you've seen me you've
[52:15] seen the
[52:16] father right the works that I do you say
[52:19] you do also that's you identifying
[52:22] yourself with
[52:24] him how important it is for for us as an
[52:28] individual to identify ourselves with
[52:30] this message amen amen you see because
[52:33] identification doesn't come from from a
[52:36] man it doesn't come from just a prophet
[52:38] it doesn't come from being a part of a
[52:40] local church or a pastor your
[52:42] identification doesn't come from your
[52:44] parents or or the person sitting next to
[52:46] you or a friend or a group that's not
[52:48] your
[52:50] identification your identification is
[52:52] personal
[52:54] amen yes
[52:57] yeah it's not based upon knowledge how
[53:01] much you know how much you can quote the
[53:03] quotes how much you can memorize the
[53:06] scriptures cuz the Lord knows I I would
[53:09] fail at
[53:10] that my memory is
[53:13] terrible and that's why we're so
[53:15] dependent upon
[53:18] him is because if it was by the
[53:21] knowledge that we had I would fail
[53:29] as I said your ident identity can only
[53:31] come from a personal Walk With Jesus
[53:33] Christ and what he reveals to
[53:38] you can we pull up the common signs of
[53:40] an identity crisis I begin to look and
[53:44] this is Brother Google
[53:46] there that I just pulled it up so I'm
[53:49] not trying to preach some theology or
[53:51] some you know science or whatever but I
[53:54] took these
[53:55] points from what the world says from a
[53:57] doctor's standpoint of view that if you
[54:00] went through a therapist this is what
[54:01] they're going to tell you they're going
[54:03] to ask you these
[54:05] questions some common signs of identity
[54:09] crisis questioning your
[54:11] character questioning traits that
[54:13] influence your
[54:17] self-perception questioning your purpose
[54:19] or position in
[54:22] life experiencing anxiety and unrest
[54:26] there's a couple more altering your
[54:29] values and inclinations frequently to
[54:32] match the environment or relationship
[54:36] that you're
[54:38] in look at that altering your
[54:42] values yeah if you don't know who you
[54:45] are if you don't know your
[54:47] identification what you're going to do
[54:48] you're going to begin to change your
[54:50] values you begin to get around work
[54:52] friends or school friends and you're
[54:54] going to want to fit in with them good
[54:57] you're going to want to fit in because
[54:58] you know what it's it's awkward to be
[55:00] the the odd men out yeah and you begin
[55:03] to change your
[55:05] values listen back people don't
[55:07] backslide
[55:09] overnight they don't backslide overnight
[55:12] that's right why is it that values begin
[55:14] to
[55:15] slack they begin to lower oh it's not
[55:18] not that big of a
[55:25] deal you have difficulty answering
[55:27] questions about
[55:29] yourself how can you answer about
[55:31] yourself if you don't know who you are
[55:35] right difficulty trusting your ability
[55:39] to make
[55:40] decisions listen it's not Upon Our Own
[55:43] ability no it's not on our own ability
[55:46] when you find the mind of Christ when
[55:47] you find your identification in the word
[55:50] he'll take care of that
[55:56] I begin to look at different Avenues of
[55:58] identity we live in a world that
[56:00] everything is goes off your
[56:02] identification you need ID to get into
[56:05] access to here and there and you need to
[56:07] when you're traveling or now you need it
[56:09] for when you go to
[56:11] Costco why because people are stealing
[56:14] other people's identity they're using
[56:16] other people's
[56:22] identity we're living in that world
[56:25] where you have to have an
[56:29] ID and now we're past the ancient age of
[56:33] just having a a swipe a swipe
[56:37] password or a number password I'm
[56:40] exaggerating a little bit but now we're
[56:41] on to what face
[56:44] identification face
[56:46] identification I don't even need to type
[56:48] in a password to the cell phone no more
[56:51] if it recognizes who I am it opens it it
[56:54] unlocks what belongs to
[56:57] me if it recognizes who I am it I have
[57:01] access to my bank account I have access
[57:03] to everything I have need of right here
[57:06] right come on but if I give it to
[57:07] brother
[57:08] Mark he has no access to what belongs to
[57:11] me on are you understanding it are you
[57:14] tracking there's another identification
[57:17] listen it's a face identification that
[57:20] you must spend time in the word of God
[57:22] and begin to realize this unlocks
[57:24] everything that you have need of and if
[57:26] you don't spend time how many times do
[57:28] you unlock that thing right many of us
[57:31] would be ashamed to say how many times
[57:33] we unlock that phone with face
[57:35] identification but yet we have no face
[57:38] oh it's unrecognized oh it's been a
[57:43] week you can't unlock what belongs to
[57:45] you if you never put in the
[57:52] time face identification
[57:57] we know that we can be influenced into
[58:00] an identity that brother Brandon would
[58:02] take this and that's where I got
[58:03] influenced by because brother Brandon
[58:05] would talk about ones in his
[58:09] day and he would begin to use movie
[58:11] stars and and different things of you
[58:14] know you can influence your kids in a
[58:16] way by allowing the things that they
[58:18] feed
[58:19] on that it might be so innocent but the
[58:22] things that they're feeding on they're
[58:23] getting identity from it and they begin
[58:26] to act like where did you learn to say
[58:28] that where did you get that
[58:30] from and then all of a sudden you're
[58:32] you're in the other room and then you
[58:33] hear it on something that they were
[58:36] watching where are they getting their
[58:39] identity the prophet of God would teach
[58:41] us be very
[58:42] careful be very
[58:49] careful us as parents we have the
[58:51] greatest
[58:53] impact on what your the identity and
[58:56] even the direction in which your kids go
[58:59] yes you begin to to set the very
[59:02] Foundation of who they are why because
[59:05] you're the greatest example of a
[59:06] Christian to them
[59:08] amen you're the greatest
[59:11] example if you show up to church and
[59:13] you're faithful and you put a priority
[59:15] on those the things of God you're
[59:18] putting an emphasis on it and it's
[59:19] showing your kids what you value more
[59:22] yeah
[59:24] true but whenever we begin to put our
[59:26] identity on something else oh son it's
[59:29] okay just do this or just go there what
[59:31] are we doing we have the greatest impact
[59:34] to influence our
[59:37] kids you know that you're your kid's
[59:39] first
[59:41] hero you're your kid's first hero until
[59:44] you give them a reason not to
[59:49] be that's
[59:52] right they're watching every move they
[59:54] want to be just like you
[59:57] how do you know that because I'm going
[59:58] through it right now with
[1:00:00] Nolan he wants to help in
[1:00:03] everything you know the other day we we
[1:00:06] I was out in the garage and he came out
[1:00:08] there and he began to you know I'm
[1:00:09] putting together this garage door
[1:00:12] machine thing
[1:00:13] and have it all set up nicely you know
[1:00:16] how you do it and the kids are inside
[1:00:17] and you separate all the bolts and you
[1:00:19] you got it all organize that's how I do
[1:00:20] it separate all
[1:00:22] sizes yeah Dad I want to help I want to
[1:00:25] help I want to help and you can see the
[1:00:27] excitement in his eyes he just wants to
[1:00:30] be with you he just wants to help
[1:00:34] you and then if you're not careful
[1:00:36] you'll quench that because you know what
[1:00:38] he's over here and he's messing with it
[1:00:39] and noan
[1:00:41] stop you messed up my pile don't do this
[1:00:43] don't do that get over here do this then
[1:00:47] he's just standing there like
[1:00:49] what and then he takes one of the bolts
[1:00:51] and I set it all up and he sits a bolt
[1:00:53] right down the center of the machine
[1:00:56] take off the end redo
[1:01:00] it and I'll say that's where I
[1:01:04] failed because I
[1:01:15] snapped you ever snap at
[1:01:18] somebody and you could see it in their
[1:01:24] face and you're taking away this drive
[1:01:27] that this kid has to want to be like you
[1:01:30] to help
[1:01:37] you and yet he doesn't even know
[1:01:40] right and I snap and I yell at him and
[1:01:45] then I realized what I was
[1:01:48] doing because we have a way to influence
[1:01:52] this we have a way to control that
[1:01:56] because he just wants to
[1:01:58] help and when you recognize when you
[1:02:00] fail as a
[1:02:02] parent and I pulled him over I said
[1:02:04] buddy thank you so much for helping
[1:02:06] me thank you for working with me and he
[1:02:09] was like Yeah Dad that was so
[1:02:12] fun but yet many times we fail as
[1:02:18] parents my wife showed me a thing the
[1:02:20] other day she just said a friendly
[1:02:23] reminder and it's a good for all us I
[1:02:26] wish I would have shown it it showed a
[1:02:28] parent on one side on their cell phone
[1:02:30] and a parent on the other and a kid with
[1:02:31] two toys in the middle of them because
[1:02:34] we're failing our
[1:02:36] children because many times we get too
[1:02:39] busy with life and cares of life and and
[1:02:41] these hindrances within our lives listen
[1:02:44] friends it's not just about just your
[1:02:46] Christian walk but it's being a good
[1:02:48] father and a good mother and a good son
[1:02:50] and a good teenager
[1:02:53] right true
[1:02:57] we have to be
[1:03:00] careful careful how we inter influence
[1:03:03] our kids by the things they watch and
[1:03:05] the things they
[1:03:06] do you know even with Nolan now he's
[1:03:08] he's walking around and he wants to be
[1:03:11] David and Goliath we show him this
[1:03:13] little show and he he wants to be David
[1:03:14] and Goliath and so him and I play David
[1:03:16] and Goliath all the time you got to die
[1:03:17] and get back up okay now you're David
[1:03:19] okay now I'm David now you're
[1:03:23] David but yet it's a cute little story
[1:03:26] now but let me tell you if I can steal
[1:03:29] in him some identity that David had back
[1:03:33] then if I can instill in him something
[1:03:36] if he can have the faith of David so now
[1:03:39] he goes to I want to be brave like David
[1:03:41] yeah you are son you're going to be
[1:03:42] brave like David why because I know one
[1:03:44] day he's going to face a Goliath one day
[1:03:47] he's going to face a bear
[1:03:53] right one day he's going to have Giants
[1:03:57] in his life and he's going to need to
[1:03:58] know how to fight
[1:04:01] them
[1:04:05] true you see within uh
[1:04:11] identity we shouldn't even have to bring
[1:04:13] it up but you you have fake
[1:04:17] IDs fake IDs that people
[1:04:20] use fake IDs are only give you access to
[1:04:23] places you shouldn't be that's right
[1:04:28] they give you access to places that you
[1:04:30] shouldn't even be but yet as I was
[1:04:33] praying before I came to church he says
[1:04:36] what about the fake IDs in the message
[1:04:38] that walk around and they show and they
[1:04:40] show that they're I'm a Son of God look
[1:04:41] at I have access to this I want to be
[1:04:43] like this I want to do this yet they're
[1:04:46] showing it because they have no real
[1:04:47] identification of who God is in their
[1:04:50] life and they're trying to gain access
[1:04:52] to a to Avenues in their lives maybe
[1:04:54] they're trying to seek for the Holy
[1:04:57] Ghost and they come up and they go back
[1:04:58] and they come up and they go back they
[1:05:00] come up for healing and they go back and
[1:05:02] they wonder why what's going
[1:05:05] on why isn't I why isn't God answering
[1:05:08] my prayer well how are you living from
[1:05:10] Monday to Saturday right exactly are you
[1:05:13] doing the things you you you should be
[1:05:15] doing are you living a consecrated life
[1:05:18] yeah are you serving God like you should
[1:05:20] be
[1:05:26] because the battle is Raging even when
[1:05:28] you know who you are even when you have
[1:05:31] an identification of who you are and
[1:05:33] what God's called you to and the
[1:05:35] position you have and the in the placing
[1:05:37] that you have and you know what you are
[1:05:40] as you're a male or a female as simple
[1:05:42] as that
[1:05:44] is but yet you know who you
[1:05:47] are you know that God sent a message a
[1:05:50] messenger to you for this
[1:05:53] day but yet still people are battling
[1:05:57] battling with identification
[1:06:02] yeah let's look in our Bibles judges 16
[1:06:05] of a man who lost and you know I'll just
[1:06:08] share the story well let's turn to
[1:06:09] judges
[1:06:10] 16 we know the
[1:06:13] story of
[1:06:15] Samson and it came to pass afterwards
[1:06:18] that he had loved a a woman in the
[1:06:20] valley of soric whose name was Delilah
[1:06:22] now I looked up her name even it came to
[1:06:24] me and her her very name means delicate
[1:06:28] or she who
[1:06:31] weakened and the Lords of the
[1:06:33] Philistines came up unto her and said
[1:06:37] unto her entice him and see wherein he
[1:06:40] his great strength lies and by the means
[1:06:43] we may prevail against him that we may
[1:06:45] bind him to afflict him and we will give
[1:06:49] the every one of us 1100 pieces of
[1:06:52] silver and Delilah said unto Samson tell
[1:06:56] me I pray thee wherein thy great
[1:06:58] strength lies wherein thou mayest be
[1:07:00] bound to afflict thee and we know the
[1:07:03] story that she would go through and she
[1:07:05] would he would tell her if you bind me
[1:07:06] with seven cords of green cords that
[1:07:10] that will hold me and then she woke him
[1:07:12] and said Samson they're upon you and he
[1:07:14] said well if you bind me with uh seven
[1:07:16] new ropes that that that'll really hold
[1:07:19] me then he said if you weave my the
[1:07:22] locks of my hair look how closer how
[1:07:25] much closer he's
[1:07:27] getting pretty soon the Satan's slowly
[1:07:30] creeping in first it's bind me just bind
[1:07:33] me with seven cords now seven new ropes
[1:07:36] now he goes right to the locks of the
[1:07:39] head he's playing with that
[1:07:41] Covenant and you play with the Covenant
[1:07:43] one too many times sir come on you play
[1:07:47] with a covenant one too many times
[1:07:50] listen I I I believe and like as I was
[1:07:53] saying you can have services that preach
[1:07:55] on
[1:07:56] predestination and for new and you know
[1:07:59] and they're all good for us right and I
[1:08:01] believe them but yet that doesn't mean
[1:08:03] that you can live any kind of life that
[1:08:06] you can live any kind of way and when
[1:08:07] you begin to mess with the Covenant that
[1:08:09] God has with you you're in
[1:08:12] danger
[1:08:14] come you're in danger yes why because
[1:08:18] that's a very sacred Covenant that God
[1:08:20] has with
[1:08:22] you God don't change for nobody amen
[1:08:26] will you be able to go through grace and
[1:08:29] mercy yeah possibly and I believe in
[1:08:33] that but yet many of us are bound by
[1:08:38] things of self-
[1:08:40] choices decisions we made as kids or in
[1:08:43] high school maybe back in our
[1:08:51] lives he began to play with it and I'm
[1:08:53] just going to skip to the quote that
[1:08:54] brother brand says once more he says now
[1:08:57] Samson gave God his strength to
[1:09:01] use but he didn't give God his heart he
[1:09:04] gave his heart to Delilah and gave his
[1:09:07] strength to
[1:09:09] God how many times within the church you
[1:09:11] begin to give God your ability and you
[1:09:14] say God I'm serving you God God I sing
[1:09:16] and and I do things for the church and I
[1:09:19] and I go to church and and I serve you
[1:09:22] and I've given you my
[1:09:24] abilities but your heart is still out
[1:09:31] there God don't care about your
[1:09:33] abilities
[1:09:35] amen God don't care about your abilities
[1:09:37] he cares about your heart because
[1:09:39] whenever he get you your heart he got
[1:09:41] your
[1:09:44] abilities but you've got to surrender
[1:09:47] soul body Spirit strength in everything
[1:09:50] you are to the will of God become a
[1:09:52] prisoner to him you're going to be a
[1:09:55] prisoner somebody's prisoner you don't
[1:09:58] belong to
[1:09:59] yourself you are somebody's prisoner
[1:10:01] you're either a prisoner of the devil
[1:10:03] knowing this truth and won't surrender
[1:10:05] to it or a prisoner to the world and
[1:10:08] surrender to God one or the other you're
[1:10:10] either the devil's prisoner to sin or
[1:10:12] you're the prison you're God's prisoner
[1:10:14] to righteousness yeah you're one or the
[1:10:20] other I begin to think as I was going
[1:10:22] through the story of
[1:10:24] Samson I wonder what God now play along
[1:10:27] with me I wonder what God could have
[1:10:29] done with Samson if he would have stayed
[1:10:31] in the perfect will of God
[1:10:34] yeah I wonder what God could have really
[1:10:36] done with that Covenant or do we look at
[1:10:39] it as a Bible story that that that's the
[1:10:42] purpose that Samson that's the why the
[1:10:44] story is there so we can relate and type
[1:10:46] you understand where I'm going yeah but
[1:10:49] what could have God really done with
[1:10:51] Samson with that Nazarite vow if he
[1:10:54] would have kept
[1:10:56] and he wouldn't have gone and married a
[1:10:58] girl that he wasn't supposed to and then
[1:10:59] he's you find him sleeping with harlots
[1:11:01] and then now he's sleeping here with the
[1:11:03] lla and he falls in love with a worldly
[1:11:09] girl yet he's still a
[1:11:12] son yet still God loved
[1:11:14] him yet in the end he still killed more
[1:11:18] more soldiers than he did in all his
[1:11:20] battles and God still used him after all
[1:11:23] those mistakes after all those
[1:11:26] failures so you may feel that you know
[1:11:29] you made a bunch of mistakes and you
[1:11:31] fell down well if you fell down get back
[1:11:33] up because there's more war to fight
[1:11:36] there's more battles to
[1:11:39] win
[1:11:40] amen you still got to keep
[1:11:49] fighting in Acts 22 another story that
[1:11:52] came to me and it came to pass that I as
[1:11:55] I journeyed and was come nigh unto
[1:11:58] Damascus about noon suddenly there
[1:12:02] was there Shone from Heaven a great
[1:12:04] light round about me and I fell into the
[1:12:06] ground and heard a voice saying Saul
[1:12:08] Saul why P persecutest thou me now
[1:12:12] listen he sees the light it's all around
[1:12:15] him he hears a
[1:12:19] voice and he said and he answered who
[1:12:22] art thou Lord and he said unto me I am
[1:12:24] Jesus of now Nazareth whom thou
[1:12:27] persecuted and they that were with me
[1:12:30] saw indeed the light and were
[1:12:33] afraid but they never heard the
[1:12:36] voice they seen the
[1:12:39] light they seen the light and were
[1:12:41] afraid let me tell you people that see
[1:12:44] this message and they come and they see
[1:12:46] the light it's one thing to see the
[1:12:48] light it's one thing to be afraid of the
[1:12:51] light but you must hear the voice that
[1:12:53] is coming behind that light
[1:12:56] you can believe in the in the prophet
[1:12:59] and he you know the pillar of fire is
[1:13:00] over his head and you can believe in
[1:13:02] that come on but yet you must catch the
[1:13:05] voice behind that
[1:13:08] amen yes because if you don't catch the
[1:13:11] voice what good does it what good does
[1:13:13] it do
[1:13:15] you they heard the V or they seen the
[1:13:18] light and were afraid but they didn't
[1:13:20] catch the voice they didn't hear the
[1:13:22] voice of him that spoke unto him
[1:13:32] and so we see that
[1:13:34] Saul we know the life that Saul lived he
[1:13:36] would
[1:13:38] persecute he would persecute the
[1:13:40] Christians he would hold the coat that
[1:13:43] ston stepen and he would come to a place
[1:13:45] in his life that God you're really
[1:13:48] choosing
[1:13:50] me why
[1:13:52] me why are you choosing me
[1:13:56] after all that he done they're not even
[1:13:58] going to accept me into the cities that
[1:14:00] I go but yet when you meet him when you
[1:14:03] come in contact with that light when you
[1:14:05] come in contact with that voice listen
[1:14:08] it's going to change your whole
[1:14:10] identity it's going to change your name
[1:14:12] it's going to change the way you walk
[1:14:14] it's going to change the way that people
[1:14:16] perceive you
[1:14:26] and now we're getting here to this
[1:14:30] point that as I was studying it kind of
[1:14:32] went into a
[1:14:33] different
[1:14:36] direction
[1:14:38] identity identify the hindrances within
[1:14:40] your
[1:14:43] spirit because we know that in a person
[1:14:46] you have Body Spirit
[1:14:48] Soul you're a
[1:14:50] Trum you have your five senses that
[1:14:54] contact the
[1:14:55] flesh but it is your spirit when things
[1:14:59] go wrong and things happen it is your
[1:15:01] spirit that is what gets wounded yeah it
[1:15:05] is your spirit that gets
[1:15:07] hurt let's read here and knoweth it not
[1:15:10] he says now this is the outside man is
[1:15:12] the flesh that's what we look at what we
[1:15:15] see and it has all five inlets to the
[1:15:18] body any grammar school child as myself
[1:15:21] would know there's five senses that
[1:15:23] control the body c t feel smell and hear
[1:15:26] and without that you can't touch the
[1:15:29] body that's the only way you have the
[1:15:31] body is these five senses skipping down
[1:15:34] he says now inside of that Spirit which
[1:15:37] you become when you're born into the
[1:15:40] Earth the Breath of Life is breathed
[1:15:41] into him that spirit is of a worldly
[1:15:44] nature because it was not given from God
[1:15:48] but it was given or permitted by
[1:15:51] God it was permitted by God why because
[1:15:54] we all come through through the sex act
[1:15:56] we know that wasn't God's provided way
[1:15:58] so we all come into the world shaped in
[1:16:01] a sin or shaped in iniquity born in sin
[1:16:04] shaped in iniquity come into the world
[1:16:06] speaking lies let's get down to the
[1:16:09] underline he says there is five inlets
[1:16:11] to the
[1:16:13] spirit you can't think with your body
[1:16:15] you think with your
[1:16:16] spirit you can't think with your
[1:16:18] conscience in your body it has no mental
[1:16:22] faculty at all your body doesn't so so
[1:16:25] you have to think with your spirit you
[1:16:26] have to reason you have to reason you
[1:16:29] can't reason with your physical being
[1:16:31] because reason doesn't see taste feel
[1:16:33] smell or
[1:16:34] hear reason is what you can make in your
[1:16:38] mind if you're asleep and you're out
[1:16:40] your body is laying there
[1:16:42] dead just like some tonight dead
[1:16:50] asleep but yet your spirit is still here
[1:16:54] your spirit is still
[1:16:56] reasoning There is five senses that
[1:16:59] controls that inside man that and the
[1:17:02] last man which is the soul there's only
[1:17:03] one sense that controls that he says
[1:17:06] it's free moral
[1:17:08] agency which you choose or
[1:17:11] reject he says and now the reason today
[1:17:15] he says don't forget this
[1:17:17] now he says what is the initial evidence
[1:17:20] of the Holy Ghost he says now people can
[1:17:22] live in this Spirit they can dance in
[1:17:25] the spirit they can shout in the spirit
[1:17:26] they can go to church in the spirit they
[1:17:28] can absolutely have the real Capital
[1:17:31] spirit of God anointed on that Spirit
[1:17:35] but still be lost in just as devil
[1:17:37] possessed as they can be with that
[1:17:41] Spirit how important is it yeah to
[1:17:45] identify within the
[1:17:48] spirit wounded within your
[1:17:53] spirit this thought came and just
[1:17:56] because we're Christians doesn't mean
[1:17:57] that we're we aren't exempt from wounds
[1:18:00] right that we're exempt from heartache
[1:18:02] that we exempt from complexes that we're
[1:18:05] exempt from persecutions or or things
[1:18:08] that would come from the outside maybe
[1:18:09] even within our own homes yeah we're not
[1:18:12] exempt from it trials that make us hard
[1:18:16] that make us callous you see the past
[1:18:19] can can can hinder your spirit if you're
[1:18:21] not dealing with it correctly true
[1:18:24] because they are lay there dormant what
[1:18:27] happens to a wound that is not taken
[1:18:29] care of
[1:18:31] correctly becomes a
[1:18:36] scar self-inflicted
[1:18:39] wounds brother brandham says all right
[1:18:41] the shepherd can't afford to lose one
[1:18:43] sheep that's the reason you backslide
[1:18:46] her tonight he's honking haunting
[1:18:48] hanging around your heart trying to draw
[1:18:50] you back to the fold because he once
[1:18:53] kissed you and you kissed him and told
[1:18:55] him that you loved him and raised your
[1:18:57] hands and praised him and you backslid
[1:18:59] and went out there and got all butchered
[1:19:01] up and
[1:19:02] wounded where not in your flesh not in
[1:19:06] your
[1:19:07] soul but in your
[1:19:10] spirit but he still holds holds around
[1:19:13] you all the time come back wandering
[1:19:15] sheep I just can't afford to let you go
[1:19:18] maybe the little sheep that he had to go
[1:19:21] away out on the mountain to find all
[1:19:23] through the place maybe you're that
[1:19:25] sheep tonight laying out there wounded
[1:19:29] somewhere let me say it doesn't even
[1:19:31] have to go for the
[1:19:33] backslider maybe you're sitting here and
[1:19:35] you've been
[1:19:38] faithful and you can't seem to get past
[1:19:41] something in your life you don't know
[1:19:42] what it is but there's a wound in your
[1:19:45] spirit there's something deep down that
[1:19:48] it might be hindering you or and it's
[1:19:50] holding you back and you don't
[1:19:52] understand where did this come from why
[1:19:54] am am I the way I am I don't understand
[1:19:58] it
[1:20:02] right and we could take wounds that go
[1:20:05] back brother brandom would teach us in
[1:20:08] in throughout his ministry people would
[1:20:10] come through the prayer
[1:20:12] lines and he would begin to discern and
[1:20:15] he would go into that fourth dimension
[1:20:17] and he would begin to see different
[1:20:19] things of of this person's life
[1:20:22] yeah and he would say you were child I
[1:20:25] see it now you were a child you were
[1:20:29] chased by a dog
[1:20:31] yeah that's where this came
[1:20:34] from that's where this th this sickness
[1:20:37] came from that's where this fear came
[1:20:39] from and yet they're an older woman or
[1:20:41] an older man let's read an example here
[1:20:45] it says good evening lady a timid Spirit
[1:20:49] that's the kind usually that's the kind
[1:20:51] of a little timid time don't have too
[1:20:53] much to say deep thinker always planning
[1:20:56] things ahead usually never happens that
[1:20:59] way
[1:21:00] though isn't that the way it always is
[1:21:03] you get all worked up for nothing you
[1:21:06] keep worrying and worrying how's this
[1:21:07] going to work out and how am I going to
[1:21:09] do this and how am I going to go there
[1:21:10] and you get all sick up in your stomach
[1:21:12] and you might go through it might be
[1:21:14] just a job interview or it might be how
[1:21:16] am I going to talk to this brother you
[1:21:17] ever wanted to approach your brother or
[1:21:19] go to
[1:21:20] somebody and you go sit down with them
[1:21:22] and you had this it all worked out in
[1:21:24] your head this this is what I'm going to
[1:21:25] say and this is how I'm going to say it
[1:21:26] and you sit down it goes completely
[1:21:29] opposite and you're like why did I spend
[1:21:31] all that time worrying about what I
[1:21:33] should have said and could have said
[1:21:36] whenever it just comes out
[1:21:41] naturally you had a great scare once in
[1:21:43] your life too something seemed like it
[1:21:46] was when you were a school girl I
[1:21:48] believe it was a dog or something
[1:21:51] along I see something bark and go and
[1:21:53] jump and scream
[1:21:56] he was just a little child and down
[1:21:58] comes
[1:21:59] Life coming down recently you've been
[1:22:02] real nervous oh yes here's something
[1:22:04] moving sister I'm sorry yes I believe
[1:22:06] it's
[1:22:08] cancer so you see this cancer he be he
[1:22:11] would begin to discern her heart and
[1:22:12] begin to talk with her and he begin to
[1:22:14] show her the sign in the hand and do
[1:22:17] that the life of the cancer is living
[1:22:18] off her life but yet this cancer was
[1:22:21] built up from a nervousness because of
[1:22:24] when she was a
[1:22:26] child right each one of us if I mention
[1:22:29] this there's things in our childhood
[1:22:32] that we've been through that were that
[1:22:34] they were wounds then and now there's
[1:22:35] scars in our
[1:22:37] minds things that happened to us as a
[1:22:40] child and you wonder why why do I act
[1:22:42] the way I act why do I do those things
[1:22:45] because it was a wound back then I'm
[1:22:48] going to be open and
[1:22:51] transparent when I was a child living in
[1:22:54] Baghdad my parents would have to go to
[1:22:56] to preset to get groceries or whatever
[1:22:58] it would be during the day Mom would
[1:23:01] drop me off at school and say okay I'll
[1:23:03] be back at the end of the day and I
[1:23:04] always had this fear that she would
[1:23:07] crash she wouldn't come
[1:23:09] home and it was a fear that I would get
[1:23:12] so worked up and you could even ask her
[1:23:14] that I would go and sit in the
[1:23:15] principal's office this is in first
[1:23:17] second grade whatever it
[1:23:19] was and I would have this fear and I
[1:23:21] would get so sick within my body that
[1:23:24] I'd have to go and sit in the
[1:23:25] principal's office because I had this
[1:23:28] fear in my mind what if she doesn't come
[1:23:30] home what if she crashes and you have
[1:23:31] all these scenarios that play in your
[1:23:33] mind I can see them right
[1:23:37] now and it was a fear that would build
[1:23:39] up and it would make me
[1:23:42] sick and I didn't know what it was till
[1:23:45] years
[1:23:47] later God began to deal with
[1:23:50] me and he began to show me
[1:23:55] and one time he told
[1:23:56] me he says this is where it came from
[1:23:59] I've never talked to my mom about it
[1:24:01] still to this day never brought it
[1:24:04] up but it was a fear that I had
[1:24:08] something in my mind what is this coming
[1:24:10] from when my mom was 18 her mom crashed
[1:24:13] and died just outside the
[1:24:17] Baghdad lord said that's where it's
[1:24:21] from I said that that it doesn't even
[1:24:24] have anything to do with
[1:24:26] me but it was this
[1:24:30] fear and the spirit
[1:24:34] said she lived that
[1:24:37] fear because it came
[1:24:40] out and I didn't even realize that it
[1:24:42] was something that bothered me all my
[1:24:44] life or it would go on for years and I
[1:24:46] would always work myself
[1:24:48] up yet it takes us back to that moment
[1:24:53] each one of us have scar the memories
[1:24:55] wounds within our minds whether we be a
[1:24:57] child maybe we weren't maybe we had a
[1:24:59] father who wasn't really a good father
[1:25:01] and he didn't re raise us right or maybe
[1:25:04] it was an abusive relationship or you
[1:25:07] just didn't have that relationship and
[1:25:09] so you're always longing for a
[1:25:11] relationship with somebody you're
[1:25:13] looking for a father figure somebody to
[1:25:16] lead you to show you the
[1:25:22] way and these scores or these memories
[1:25:25] and wounds within our Spirits can be
[1:25:28] within us if we don't fix them yeah they
[1:25:31] can lay dormant there for
[1:25:34] years and it's time out and time again
[1:25:37] that I would begin to look into this and
[1:25:39] the prophet would find another uh
[1:25:41] brother here and he says that all this
[1:25:43] worry and Gloom and feeling the crazy
[1:25:46] feeling like you're losing your mind and
[1:25:50] things like that and he says now I tell
[1:25:52] you where it started on the pro he says
[1:25:55] but what really is doing it's a demon
[1:25:57] It's haunting you is that right he says
[1:26:00] you have no peace at all day or night
[1:26:04] it's after you seems like you just get
[1:26:06] gloomy feelings in there is that right
[1:26:08] he says yes sir he says worry don't
[1:26:11] sleep nervous gets up at night is that
[1:26:15] right he says when you was a child a
[1:26:19] little boy with knee pants
[1:26:22] on you got problem comes and with
[1:26:25] something run he says I believe it's a
[1:26:27] dog that chased you or something is that
[1:26:29] right a big dog and you ran to the porch
[1:26:32] says that's right I see it as a little
[1:26:34] boy it's the
[1:26:35] truth he says who would know that but
[1:26:37] only God but he says that's where it
[1:26:40] started takes him all the way back to
[1:26:42] his childhood all the way back to a
[1:26:46] place even some of these wounds within
[1:26:49] us we don't even realize that they're
[1:26:51] there right amen
[1:26:57] they could be wounds that you were
[1:27:00] raised in maybe a religious
[1:27:02] home can I say this there's a difference
[1:27:05] between religious
[1:27:07] home a religious home in a Christian
[1:27:12] Home a religious
[1:27:14] home because if you're so religious and
[1:27:16] you crank down on your kids and you
[1:27:18] can't do this and what does your t-shirt
[1:27:20] mean and and where did that come from
[1:27:22] and what is the definition of this and
[1:27:23] how do you get this and you can take all
[1:27:26] the the the life out of the kid brother
[1:27:30] Brandon would take talk about the horse
[1:27:31] and you can train a horse you take a
[1:27:33] wild horse but you can beat the spirit
[1:27:35] out of that horse you don't take the
[1:27:38] spirit out of it you just give it in a
[1:27:40] direction to
[1:27:41] go sir right but yet we can crank this
[1:27:45] message so tight you can't even live but
[1:27:48] what good does that
[1:27:50] do because then you can live in a home
[1:27:52] that I'm going to shelter my kids I'm
[1:27:54] going to homeschool and I'm not going to
[1:27:55] do this and they're going to be so
[1:27:57] protected what happens when they turn 18
[1:28:00] right and they have a choice to go
[1:28:09] yeah maybe you were a parent and you
[1:28:11] were raised in a certain way maybe you
[1:28:13] grew up with uh the less fortunate maybe
[1:28:16] the Lord started blessing you and you
[1:28:18] said you know what I'm never going to
[1:28:19] let my kids live that way I'm going to
[1:28:21] give them everything they want I'm going
[1:28:23] to show him everything I'm going to take
[1:28:25] him everywhere what happens you begin to
[1:28:27] spoil them if you don't do it the right
[1:28:30] way you begin to spoil them you make
[1:28:32] them spoil
[1:28:36] brats but yet it was because something
[1:28:39] that this man he might have grown up in
[1:28:42] maybe a father that he grew up in all
[1:28:44] his life but then he didn't want his
[1:28:46] kids to be that
[1:28:50] way raised in a troubled home
[1:28:56] raised in a troubled home where maybe
[1:28:59] the the father doesn't show the love to
[1:29:01] a mother like he should or to the kids
[1:29:04] maybe he was raised in a broken
[1:29:10] home and you don't even know what
[1:29:13] a a real family looks
[1:29:17] like and its wounds within your
[1:29:21] spirit something that's hindering you
[1:29:24] yeah because you know what's going to
[1:29:25] happen if you don't handle
[1:29:27] situations you don't happen you don't
[1:29:30] handle these things that come to your
[1:29:31] memory listen I don't have to discern
[1:29:33] your hearts you're Discerning right now
[1:29:36] that's
[1:29:37] right I can sense the spirit of he's
[1:29:40] taking you back to this memory and that
[1:29:42] memory showing you where this or that or
[1:29:45] why I thought
[1:29:46] this it's true somebody in your
[1:29:51] home that's what he's doing right now
[1:29:55] but if you don't handle if you don't
[1:29:57] take the ointment of the Holy Spirit and
[1:29:59] put it over that scar if you don't do
[1:30:01] that wound right now it's going to turn
[1:30:04] into a scar in your later
[1:30:06] years then you're going to have your own
[1:30:08] family or you're you're going to be a
[1:30:10] grandfather or down down the road
[1:30:12] somewhere and you're going to be like
[1:30:13] how did I get here why do I respond this
[1:30:16] way and it was an untreated wound yeah
[1:30:19] very good
[1:30:21] yes choices you make
[1:30:32] you know
[1:30:35] choices of the direction of your
[1:30:38] identity each one of us have choices
[1:30:41] yeah some of these choices are
[1:30:43] self-inflicted as I said yeah these
[1:30:46] wounds are self-inflicted why because
[1:30:49] you want to fit in or you want to try it
[1:30:51] or you want to have a testimony listen
[1:30:53] you don't have to go out there to have a
[1:30:55] testimony because you know what they
[1:30:57] that's going out there and trying that
[1:30:58] you want to go smoke you want to go
[1:31:00] drink you want to sleep around with
[1:31:02] girls you want to do those worldly
[1:31:03] things you know what's going to cause
[1:31:07] wounds
[1:31:09] scars things that are going to be
[1:31:11] brought up in your memory and you're
[1:31:12] like where did that come from it's true
[1:31:17] yeah things that you'll have to deal
[1:31:19] with for the rest of your life because
[1:31:21] of a choice that you made when you were
[1:31:23] a teenager
[1:31:30] true and the
[1:31:33] access is something hinders you to get
[1:31:36] something there's other other
[1:31:39] avenues in order to tap into that realm
[1:31:42] that you
[1:31:44] Desiring if you're trying to have access
[1:31:46] to certain thing and something hinders
[1:31:49] you and you can't get there what do you
[1:31:51] do you can get on the web and you can
[1:31:52] search and you can look up different
[1:31:54] things you can go places that you
[1:31:57] shouldn't be
[1:31:58] why because you're searching for
[1:32:01] something you're searching for an
[1:32:03] identity but you can't find your
[1:32:05] identity out
[1:32:13] there you see when things happen in our
[1:32:15] lives they they are wounds and if
[1:32:17] they're not treated correctly they
[1:32:18] become scars and as time goes on these
[1:32:21] scars become callous and hard
[1:32:29] and these don't happen within the as we
[1:32:32] we talked about it doesn't happen within
[1:32:34] the flesh man it doesn't happen within
[1:32:37] our natural bodies because what happens
[1:32:40] in our five senses as time goes on you
[1:32:43] don't feel the pain no more you're not
[1:32:45] wounded in your flesh at the moment if
[1:32:48] you get a scar if you get a cut and it's
[1:32:50] deep you feel the pain you feel it there
[1:32:53] but at as time goes on you don't feel it
[1:32:55] no more there but there's a scar and
[1:32:58] where are you wounded in your mind
[1:33:00] because you can remember that scar it's
[1:33:02] true you can remember you can pull up
[1:33:04] the pain that it w was the experience
[1:33:07] the memory
[1:33:16] yeah Isaiah 53 and
[1:33:20] 5 musicians come
[1:33:24] but he was wounded for our transgression
[1:33:26] and he was bruised for our iniquity the
[1:33:28] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:33:30] and with his
[1:33:32] stripes we are healed amen amen we need
[1:33:36] the ointment of the Holy Spirit to come
[1:33:38] and to wash us and to cleanse us and to
[1:33:40] show us those scars to show us those
[1:33:43] wounds within our spirit amen to menend
[1:33:46] the
[1:33:47] Brokenhearted to menend those things
[1:33:49] that are so deep down in our
[1:33:52] lives that we don't real realize they
[1:33:54] have an impact on our lives but they
[1:33:56] do if they're not handled
[1:33:59] correctly why does the Bible say in
[1:34:02] Ezekiel 36 a new heart also will I give
[1:34:05] you and a new spirit will I put in you
[1:34:08] and I will take away the Stony heart out
[1:34:11] of your flesh and I will give you a
[1:34:13] heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit
[1:34:16] in
[1:34:17] you yes and cause you to walk in my
[1:34:20] statutes that you may keep my judgments
[1:34:24] and do them that's the identity I want
[1:34:26] to identify with that's the spirit I
[1:34:28] want to
[1:34:30] have one that he can
[1:34:33] come he's a good father he's a good
[1:34:38] God I know it's a Wednesday
[1:34:42] night but I know that there's things
[1:34:44] within our lives that if we're not
[1:34:46] careful we just push it aside and don't
[1:34:48] think much of it
[1:34:57] identity is an important
[1:34:59] [Music]
[1:35:01] thing convinced and concerned he says a
[1:35:04] man has got to be convinced first and
[1:35:08] the only convincing thing is that the
[1:35:10] only convincing thing is the
[1:35:12] manifestation or the identity of the
[1:35:15] Gospel being
[1:35:16] identified in
[1:35:18] you he says when you see that you have
[1:35:21] come passed from Death unto life and
[1:35:23] become a new cre creature in Christ
[1:35:25] Jesus that's the
[1:35:27] identity of the Holy
[1:35:30] Spirit that's the identity of the holy
[1:35:35] spirit says there's a genuine Holy Ghost
[1:35:38] there's a genuine holy spirit Spirit of
[1:35:41] God there is a genuine power of God
[1:35:44] there is a Son of God that's reflecting
[1:35:46] himself tonight is the spirit of God to
[1:35:49] show forth his life he's standing here
[1:35:52] tonight in the midst of you in the form
[1:35:53] of the Holy Spirit to pound out all the
[1:35:55] dross out of you the doubt and reflect
[1:35:58] to you his resurrection that he's not
[1:36:01] dead that he is here to show you that
[1:36:04] he's living the same yesterday today and
[1:36:07] forever he is here to identify himself
[1:36:10] with us should we not then identify
[1:36:13] ourselves with him to believe his word
[1:36:16] and to take it let's stand
[1:36:20] tonight you see identification is a
[1:36:22] powerful thing
[1:36:25] Satan's going to put hindrances within
[1:36:27] your life he's going to put things
[1:36:29] within your spirit things that are going
[1:36:31] to come against you to hinder from you
[1:36:33] from coming to the full identity of who
[1:36:36] you
[1:36:38] are identification is
[1:36:42] personal it's a powerful thing because
[1:36:45] when you know who you are you know your
[1:36:47] placing
[1:36:57] let's just bow our
[1:37:03] heads our gracious Heavenly
[1:37:10] Father Lord we humble ourselves in your
[1:37:15] [Music]
[1:37:18] presence Lord as your Prophet would
[1:37:20] identify down through his ministry
[1:37:23] he would take ones that would come up
[1:37:25] for prayer and he would
[1:37:27] say let's take it back to your childhood
[1:37:31] let's take it back to your teenage years
[1:37:34] maybe you've seen something you
[1:37:35] shouldn't have maybe you did something
[1:37:37] you shouldn't have and now it's caused
[1:37:39] his sickness it's caused this fear over
[1:37:40] your life it's caused you to do things
[1:37:43] that you you didn't think you would do
[1:37:46] if you ask
[1:37:47] the if you ask the bum on the side of
[1:37:50] the road if you ask the prostitute on
[1:37:52] the street and you said where would you
[1:37:54] be in 20 years they never thought that
[1:37:56] they would be
[1:37:58] there how did they get there they lost
