we we know ourselves we know our Humanity we know Lord that our sins are as filthy rags but because of your grace Lord we stand and father We Stand upon thy Grace and upon thy grace alone bless your people this morning Lord May our hearts be open to receive whatever it is you have for us to receive we love you Lord we thank you we ask your blessings now upon the remainder of the service in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen God bless you this morning it's good to be gathered in the house of the Lord and uh like to say to all the fathers Happy Father's Day and I was I was thinking about Father's Day and I I thought you know it is not a burden to be a father it's not a burden to be a father but it's it's a blessing to be a father and it is an honor to be a father and so may we just uh it's easy to say that when everything's going okay isn't it but it's still a blessing and it's still an honor and I honor you all of our faithful Godly fathers who have raised children who have raised families who are in the process of raising children and raising families in the admonition of God I honor you this morning and above all we honor our father our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen if you have your Bible's turn with me to the book of Philippians chapter 2 thank you musicians so much and we'll read verses 5 through 8. it's always an honor to stand before you and we certainly thank further Ron for the opportunity to to minister this thought that God has placed on our hearts Philippians chapter 2 we'll read verses 5 through 8. it says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God notice what he did though but made himself of no reputation though he was equal with God though he was he found it not robbery to be equal with God yet what did he do he found himself and took upon him and made himself of no reputation instead of going the highway instead of being proud and boastful guess what he did he took the low way and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross I've been pondering upon this this thought this scripture in verse ate there and though he being found in the fashion as a man he yet he he humbled himself I won't preach on it this morning but the Lord willing I will preach on it in the future turn with me to the Book of Proverbs chapter 22. and we'll read verse 4. Proverbs chapter 22. and verse 4 it says by humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated this morning I would like to take for a thought this morning God's School of humility and I would like to take for a subject of Nebuchadnezzar's dream and so my original thought that I wanted to preach on was upon humility and if the Lord will it is something that I would like to preach on and more in depth in the next few services that I take but the more that I was putting my sermon together and putting my notes together and Gathering my thoughts uh I realized that the Lord was taking me in a direction to perhaps lay a foundation of uh my future services and so I would like to look at Nebuchadnezzar's dream and we realize that we are living in the days where the Bible said that the people would call evil good and they would call good evil it is the days of gross Darkness being Darkness being upon the Earth and gross darkness is upon the people I could say that there's never been a time like this time that we are now living in where there is such a perversion and darkness not only upon the world but upon the people upon Humanity that is dwelling within this world we realize that brother Branham said there was never as dark a time as the day that we are living in right now and what is it that is making it such a dark place it's it's it's it's it's the filth it's the perversion it's the sin it's the calling the good evil and the evil good it's a complete turnaround uh from from the very principles of the Bible that we follow and because we've left God out of our out of our schools because we've left God out of our homes because we have taken God uh out of the government and all these different things when you take light away there's nothing but Darkness but the Bible also says that in the evening time there shall be light and so we're thankful that though we are living in the darkest hour that this Earth has ever seen and though there's gross Darkness upon the people and though there's evil all around us we realize that we are also living in the day of the greatest light that has ever shone we are living in a time where this word that has been sealed up and it has been closed for centuries has now been opened and revealed unto us the Bride of Jesus Christ that's why there's light that's why there's light in Goshen this morning why because the word has been revealed and it has been opened unto us brother Branham would often sing that song it shall be light about the evening time the path to Glory ye shall surely find through the water away it is the light today buried in the precious name of Jesus what is it that shining before us it's the very word of God so it's very easy for us as Believers to we have two options we can either look at the darkness we can either look at the sin and the perversion that's around us or we can look at the light of God we have a choice this morning we can look at those things that pull us down as Believers we can look at those things which which gives us a depression Upon Our Lives or we can look at the promises of God or we can look at the light and walk in the light as he is in the light what are you choosing this morning it all depends on what dog we're feeding doesn't it Hallelujah praise the Lord the little kids last week they sang This Little Light of Mine I'm gonna let it shine you know it's easy to shine your light when there's Darkness all around you don't gotta preach somebody a sermon you don't gotta know all the The Depths and the ins and outs and the ups and downs and and and and the great Mysteries of the word just live a life and you living a life that is different from everybody else is letting your light shine so let your light shine don't let it just be for a song for the little kids but let it be for the middle age the elders and all of us put together let our lights shine before this world so we find out that it's this day that we're living in is the Fulfillment of second Timothy chapter three one through five turn with me if you will second Timothy chapter 3 verses one through five and it says this no also that in the last days perilous times shall come so when perilous times comes in our lives guess what it shouldn't be this great uh uh what's the word surprise ah I'm surprised shocker perilous times are amongst us yeah because the Bible says so now notice the characteristics of this for man shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful and Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent fears despisers of those that are good they'll be traitors they'll be heading high-minded lover of Pleasures more than loving of God having a form of godliness notice they have a form of godliness but they deny the power thereof from such turn away mankind has become so proud mankind has become so arrogant they've become so boastful in themselves for who they are and what they believe in of course we know what month it is and it's it's pride month and you know a day isn't good enough no more it went from a day to a week now it goes from a week to a month and and it's a time where everybody that that once hid in a closet that people that once had a little bit of uh uh moral decency about them to say this this this life that I'm living I I ought to be hiding it I shouldn't be proud of it because I know it's wrong I know it's not natural uh uh and it used to be that they would be in the closet because so to speak why was that because they had enough common decency to know that it's not right but now we're living in a day where times are very rapidly changing amongst us where people are not only coming out of the closet but they're encouraged to come out of the closet they're encouraged to be proud they're encouraged to be boastful they're in they're encouraged to rub it in your face of what they believe in I wonder what would happen if we as Believers as Christians had a day of pride for who we are and what we believe in and all these different things my goodness and there be riots all over the place we it would there would be they would uh label us as hate crime and hate this and all that just because we're believers it's getting to a point where a Believer doesn't have a a leg to stand on but it's okay because perilous times guess what they're going to come that's right what are they proud of is the question they're proud of how they're living they're proud of the thoughts and the desires in their heart really when we boil it down to one thing they're proud of sin what is it it's not just well this person wants to live this kind of life and do this over here yeah they're not just proud of that they're proud of sin they're not proud of of living a righteous life they're not proud of of living a life of decency but they're proud of sin and their life and they want everybody else to know about it isn't that how Satan is oh my when proud was found in his heart that's why they're all proud because they're all like their father God help us you're trying to say brother Stephen that everybody that lives in unclean life like this can't be safe definitely not but it'll take the grace of almighty God just like it did you and I they like to say that I am who I am and this is how God made me to be well they're correct in a certain way but they're just talking about the wrong God they're not talking about the creator of heavens and earth but they're talking about the God of this evil age Satan's eat in 1965 brother Branham said now he by this fall it has took over and possessed the Garden of Eden himself he's talking about Satan he took it over and now he has had six thousand years of deceitful rule deceiving the people God's children as he did then because they were based on free moral agency to act any way they wish to and believing that they would act right or trusting they would act right then they've come with the wrong act and sold their birth rights as Esau did for the world and Satan won it and he took it over and he said six thousand years to build up his Eden as God had six thousand years to bring his Eden to a close and by deceit deceit of the word or the people now established his own Eden in this earth in sin so he took the word but he used the word and he preached it in deceit and by preaching the word and deceit it brought forth sin and the lives of God's children see how important it is for the ministry to hold a standard how important it is for the ministry to preach the word without fear or favor you see how easy it is to get off and deceit to get off the wrong track to get off the path of the written word I pray that my Ministry is a Ministry that doesn't sugar sugarcoat anything I don't want to be a sugar coder but I want to be a minister of the word because at the end of the day it brings forth fruit you sugarcoat the word you're going to bring you're going to bring forth a sugar-coated Christian brother Branham would say a hybrid Christian somebody who has to be babied somebody who has to be uh petted along the ways and brother Brennan said that's not a real true Christian a true Christian has a backbone a true Christian will stand upon the principles of the word a true Christian will stand upon their convictions no matter what the world says just because the government is trying to push things and say that things are okay and that things are right it doesn't mean that they are okay and that they are right because really they have their own agenda and their their agenda is not preaching the word but their agenda is anti-word and deceit which is going to lead to sin so what's up to us now as Believers not to get on Instagram and get on Facebook and put our quotes on there and absolutely tear everybody apart and comment on different things no our uh it's up to us to raise our friends and our children and our families and those around us to raise us together to raise one another in the admonition of God to help one another and to speak truth one to another you've got to get out here and blast everybody but within the house of God but within the family of God we need to remind ourselves of Truth because guess what they're going to keep trying to pressure it they're going to keep trying to push it they're going to keep pushing their agendas on our families they're going to keep pushing their agendas on our children on our loved ones and they're going to make it hard to live if you don't go along with their agendas is not a time to be high now is not a time for a sugar-coated sermon now is not a time for us as Believers to live a sugar-coated life and to sympathize with sin but now is the time for us to stand Upon Our Own two feet and to stand Upon Our convictions Hallelujah say brother Stephen I am I am doing that well God bless you continue to do so but what happens is too much of the time we begin to sympathize well that's just how God made them and you know your children will come home and next thing you want to you want to sugarcoat and say well that's okay no it's not okay that's not truth they don't like truth when you tell the truth it comes forth as hatred when you tell the truth to somebody and say no according to God's word that is not true you'll be known as as someone that hates another person for how they feel that they are no I'm just telling truth what is truth Jesus stood before Pilate well what is truth I am the truth the way and the life and what is he he is the revealed word for the hour in which we're living in it's not just a man of History who died upon a cross for our sins but he's a Living Word and when you take that Living Word and you eat that Living Word you become the Living Word that's what he is in this hour he is not dead but he is alive it is not a dead letter but it is a letter that is alive and inspired you say I wonder what God thinks of all these things that's going on amongst us we'll just read the words you'll find out because he doesn't change his mind he doesn't change his ways as he saw something and and it was inspired and pinned down by by by prophets of God guess what what they wrote is still good enough for this day in this hour foreign now Satan established his own Eden and uh his own Eden in this earth in sin paragraph 61. God's Eden was established in righteousness Satan's Eden is established in sin because Satan is sin how simple is that God is righteousness and God's kingdom was established in righteousness and peace and life and Satan's establishment is in sin and religious sin religious what is a religious sin it has taken the word and preaching it in deceit trying to tickle the ears of the people trying to tell the people what they think they want to hear well it's okay for you to go on through this it's all right God knows your heart yeah you do those things your heart is full of sin God keep our hearts pure Lord that we can apply the word to our hearts because out of the heart that's where the life flows God help us not to get religious amen so we find out that Satan is the ruler of the kingdoms of this Earth he proved it once when he took Jesus up to a high mountain and a pit up there and he looked at all the kingdoms it was and all the kingdoms that would ever be and he said if you'll just Bow Down and Worship me all these kingdoms I'll give them to you how could he give something to Jesus that was not his so from the Garden of Eden When sin was introduced and he began to preach his Gospel of sin by deceit of the word we realize now that he took over the kingdoms of this Earth laughs so we find out that these the kingdoms of this Earth when we read about the dream of Nebuchadnezzar we see that this dream is a foreshadow of the kingdoms that was to come upon this Earth Daniel chapter 2 verses 31 through 45. thou O King sawest and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image's head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass and so we can take the word now and each of these medals is a a symbol of something it is a meaning of something thou saw us till us uh his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay thou saw us till a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to Pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broke into pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole Earth this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king thou O King are the King of Kings for the god of Heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and Glory and where wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath given into thine hand and hath made the ruler over them all thou art this head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee in another third Kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth and the fourth Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breakth and pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breaketh all these shall it break in pieces and bruise and whereas thou saws defeat and Toes part of Potter's clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou saws they are and mixed with Maori clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with Clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever and everybody said amen for as much as thou saw us that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay silver and gold the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof is sure the King was asking a very hard and difficult thing at this time when you read the story we find that he had this dream and um and he wanted his his musicians and magicians and all the different wise men of that day to to not only tell the king what the dream was but also to give the interpretation thereof and it got to a point where everybody thought my goodness this is an impossible feat for man to do and that was true but it what is impossible for man is possible for God and so the king here at this time he was going to put all the wise men to death because they were unable to tell him of his dream because no doubt he knew if they can tell me what the dream is the interpretation of the dream will also be correct and so Daniel came up and not only did he mention what tell the king exactly what the dream was but he was able to give the interpretation of the dream and so brother Branham he would take this and he would say uh a man that is able to interpret dreams and visions and what they mean he should be able to tell the person what the dream was that they dreamed before they gave the the interpretation otherwise you get people out here and they're just saying well this is a symbol and your dream means this and this uh this is a sword and it's a two-aged sword and that means the word and on and on and on and it's just a bunch of uh uh carnality it's just a bunch of people that are that are going before men and saying well well if interpret me this dream interpret to me this dream they can just make up something and what happens is that people have so much confidence in the man that they'll believe anything that he says but brother Brown on me he put that to rest people would come before him and he would say this is the dream that you had and therefore this is the interpretation thereof therefore the interpretation is not of man but it's of God so we understand that this Vision that Nebuchadnezzar had it makes up a picture of a man and this picture is symbolic of the times of the Gentiles everybody knows that right and so do we have that picture uh there it is and so here we have this this statue this of this dream that Nebuchadnezzar had and and it was the head of gold and we see the arms and the chest of silver we see that there was there was the the the belly and the thighs were of bronze and the thighs and the legs and the feet were of clay and so we understand too the Bible said that the feet was a mixture of clay and of iron so all of these things for us as Believers we can read it and we can look at the pictures and we can say my well what a fantastic dream that is I wonder what it means I wonder about these kingdoms of when they were and what happened and I and and and I wonder what exactly this stands for understand there's always a a spiritual aspect to symbols and pictures within the scripture and so we can actually take this scripture we can take this picture and we can actually break it apart and we can apply it to our lives in this day in which we are living because what good is it to to preach a sermon that's full of symbols what good is it to preach a sermon that is full of inspiration are not full full of information and full of symbols and full of these things and it does absolutely nothing to us in our daily walks at that point it's just information at that point it's just nice words at that point it is just history but if we can take it from history if we can take the symbols and we can break it apart and apply it to our lives it'll help us in our daily walks God help us this morning and you can just leave that picture up that's fine um so we find that the first kingdom is the Babylonian Kingdom and if you want a lot of quotes and stuff for this you can go and and brother Branham says a lot of things about the head of gold and just type in head of gold you'll get 40 or 50 quotes that brings this all up of the teachings of what brother Branham said this was we find out that this head of gold was the Babylonian Kingdom and brother Branham said that this Kingdom first began by Kush who was the son of ham does everybody remember who the son of ham was ham was the son of Noah so Noah had three sons ham sham and japheth that survived the great flood that God caused upon to come upon the Earth and he had three sons and one of these sons was called ham I'm making it very simple so that everybody can understand because some of you guys yeah guess what you don't read your Bibles ham I never heard of ham well if I say Noah he'll go I know Noah I learned that in Sunday school it's not good enough to just learn things in Sunday school but you gotta read your Bible yourself so that when the minister says something you go oh I remember ham you know how ham was the bad one ham is a pig and pigs for the Jews is bad right they weren't allowed to eat pork weren't allowed to eat ham so ham was the bad one or could I say he was up the seat of the serpent so now here was ham who was the son of Noah who had a son who was called Kush and he began to make this Babylonian uh City and his son was called nimrod Brother Martin is going to be so happy with me this morning so Nimrod the Bible says was a great warrior a great hunter Genesis 10 verses 8 through 9 and Kush begat Nimrod and he began to be a mighty one in the earth he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord wherefore it is said even as Nimrod the mighty Hunter before the Lord now we realize that brother Branham said that through Nimrod as the beginning of all idolatry as the beginning of all paganism as the beginning of all the worship of the son and of the stars and the moons and all these different things that's why brother Branham said that all of their denominational ideas and everything that we see upon the Earth right now it All Began in Genesis it all began with Nimrod because Nimrod he had a purpose within his heart and within his life why why would he bring in idolatry why would he bring in a paganism why would he bring in a worship of something uh that was different than what they knew was true because Satan is always taking the word that is true and he is beguiling the people to believe a Lie by the truth so he'll take a little bit of Truth and he allowed one word to it and he'll take away one word from here and by doing so by doing so he's taken the people off the right track but why did he do it why is he purposing in his heart to do this because he's of the wrong seat because the seed of God will always stay with the word so when did this this paganism and the worship of of of of of animals and stars and all the different things that that people worship from that time since the fall of God and Eden until now it all started with the head of gold Babylon through nimrod we find that it begins with the head and it goes right down through the body to the feet understand it's the same spirit it's the same devil it's the same deceitfulness that started in Genesis that ends in Revelation the Beast and the beginning is the same beast that's in the end he changes not he just changes his mask he he he changes the word that he brings once in a while but it's the same devil and notice he starts from the head to the feet where does the church begin it begins at the bottom it begins with humility but yet this these kingdoms it begins and it starts with the head so we find that it starts in the head and it goes to the feet now what is so interesting about the fetus brother Branham said that footsteps are possession and we understand that this iron and is is absolutely the Roman Catholic Church it was it was papal Rome that failed there was Pagan Rome that fell and it was given life back into papal room and why was it until the end time why was why was it not that clay mixed in with the hands and all these different things because it was mixed into the feet because there's Doctrine this paganism has walked throughout every country upon planet Earth possessing footsteps possessing by lies possessing by deceit possessing by fear possessing with a rod of iron Allelujah it's the same spirit the same Antichrist spirit that began to ride as a white horse rider is the same one when he begins to ride in his black horse or Pale Horse whatever it wanted is it's the same devil it's the same Spirit of antichrist he's just changing his horse he says changing his mask every time it's the same one we're telling the same story only through a different symbol it begins with the head of gold that ends in the feet now I'm giving the information I'm giving the symbols but at the end we'll bring it down to our lives otherwise it's just nice I was informative how was the sermon informative it was nice I learned about the history of the church fantastic how's that going to help you I don't know but it was nice and it was good God help us to take the information and that we can give the Revelation towards applicable to us from the youngest to the oldest now so it starts with the head and next it goes to the silver of the arms and of the chest area and we brother Branham said that that kingdom was the medo-persian Empire of the breast and arms of silver now remember that the Babylonians were the ones that first destroyed the temple in Jerusalem that's why Daniel was in Babylon because Nebuchadnezzar had come the and and the Babylonians they had taken the Jews they had destroyed the first temple they had taken captive all the the goodly young man and the wise man and now they were using them for their own pleasure and so now here was Daniel as a Jew in Babylon interpreting this dream from Nebuchadnezzar that's why he was there he was a captive now at that time God raised up this uh this middle uh Persian Empire for one purpose and that was to destroy Babylon and God would use King Cyrus to cause the Jews to return to Jerusalem for the rebuilding of the Temple so we find out that God is the one that raised up this next Empire but though God is the one that raised it up to bring to pass his word yet Satan uses that same thing now and he perverts it because that's what Satan does he is a perverter of the things that God is doing notice this Ezra chapter 1 verses 1 through 4. now in the first year of Cyrus King of Persia that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King of Persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying thus saith Cyrus King of Persia the Lord God Of Heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has charged me to build him and house at Jerusalem which is in Judah who is there among you of all his people his God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and build the house of the Lord God of Israel he is the god which is in Jerusalem and whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth let the man of of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods and with beasts beside the Free Will offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem so we find out from at that point now what what was God doing God was taking away this Babylonian Empire now God had raised up this Babylonian Empire because the Jews man there are hard-hearted people aren't they they're stiff-necked people it didn't matter how many times that God would deliver them they would always go right back into sin again they always had whenever the man of God whenever that judge would raise up they would follow him and they would be they would be good and they would be faithful but when he would that judge would pass away what would happen to Israel they would go right back into their idolatry again they would go right back into living in their sin again and I think us as Gentiles sometimes were very much like Jewish people we got a hard heart we got a stiff neck every time that God delivers us from something guess what we're doing going right back into it again not too much longer later God help us you say well if the pastor was just there or if the minister was just there and hey what are you doing by yourself you need to learn how to overcome Satan by yourself in your own territory because there will be times when there's no one else around to help you you got to learn to stand alone on the Promises of God and learn to overcome the thoughts of Satan that he puts in your mind so it was pretty interesting that God had raised up Babylon for this purpose but when his purpose was fulfilled now he's raising up somebody else now he's raising up another Empire now he's raising up another kingdom to do away with this Kingdom because this Kingdom fulfilled his purpose because it was time for the Jews to go back in their Homeland and so not only did he raise up this Empire and not only did he raise up this King but he also said hey I'm going to send you money I'm going to give you gold I'm going to give you silver and beasts and whatever it is that you need I'm gonna help you along the way to build this Temple God has given us everything that we need for the journey it's all written within the word thank you Lord so the next Empire was the Grecian Empire and that's the belly and thighs of brass we move on from there we go down to the Roman Empire of the legs and feet of iron and clay so we realize that God has done something which is very special and and he would raise up kingdoms and cause kingdoms to fall and he would raise up an Empire and when that Empire fulfilled its purpose guess what he would cause that Empire to fall and so we see that no matter what goes on around us it's all in the will and plan of God almighty what we have to do as Believers is just put Trust in God that he knows what he's doing God knows exactly what he is doing his timing is perfect and his will is perfect which is his word so don't worry everything's gonna be all right everything's gonna be all right why is everything going to be all right because God is in control so we realize that if we keep the word as symbols it'll never help us but if we can take it and if we can break it down for the day in which we are living we realize that God's word is a help unto us now this statue it is a it resembles our Humanity it is a statue of a man and I believe that if we can take the statue and if we can take these these precious metals that has been used as symbols it'll really help us to understand ourselves and our Humanity because that's exactly what this is it is a statue of the humanity and the characteristics of man understand Satan has had six thousand years to perfect this statue so I want you to notice that the head of golden as I begin to think of this head of gold and what it means to us as Believers we realize that out of all these Metals this head of gold that gold is the most precious out of all the metals it is the metal that is worth the most amount of money it is the metal that is most valuable it is the metal that that everybody Longs after is gold everybody's not longing after iron and clay and and Brass no it's gold there was a reason why there was a gold rush because everybody wanted gold because gold was valuable now a characteristic about gold is gold is out of all these Metals gold is the most malleable of these metals that we're looking at what that means is it is the it is the softest out of all the metals it can be moldable it can be malleable it can be beaten down it can be stretched it can be twisted because it is a very soft metal and I got to thinking and I thought well why is it of the mind and of and of the head because it goes to show us where Satan's uh the most valuable places that he wants to attack us as humanity and that's within our minds it's the most important spot for Satan brother Branham said that uh the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind of humanity the greatest battle ever fought is not with your spouse it's not with your husband it's not with your teenage children and it's not with the dog at home though sometimes it feels like it but the greatest battle ever fought is within our minds against the the darts that the enemy likes to throw at us and our and our mind being so malleable if I could type it as gold that some people when you don't understand the battle we can be torn in so many different ways if it can be beaten and it can be stressed and you think well this person told me this over here and this person told me this over here and and this person over here and and I just don't know what is truth and I don't know what the Bible says and I just don't know and I don't know and they don't understand the battle God's word says this but yet my mind says this what is happening is this gold is being beaten it's being Twisted it's being formed it's being stretched have you ever been there or you felt like your mind has just been so stretched so stretched with stress so stressed with the importance of your job so stretched with your kids and family and all these different things that you just don't know which way to turn that your mind is just so bombarded and you don't know how to get rid of it brother Branham says you've got to let off the pressure you've got to find the pressure valve somewhere and press that thing and let the air out well how do I know which thoughts are mine and which thoughts are Satan how do I know when God speaks to me how do I know brother Brenham said it is so simple if your thoughts are good it's from God but if they're bad guess what it's Satan's planting those thoughts in your mind so simple so if I can take that simple quote and I can say if I have a thought in my mind against a certain situation against a certain brother or a certain sister within the church and it's not a nice goodly God provoking thought it's so now what do we do with these thoughts that these complexes that come into our minds we put up the shield of faith and we quench them so Brothers David you mean to tell me that even if somebody does something wrong in me in my life and I have an ill thought towards them yeah it's from Satan because the word of God says this forgive that you might be forgiven so now if there is something that's within your mind not your heart notice the difference I could say I could almost guarantee if I was to ask all of you guys put up your hand those of you that hate one person within the assembly hate from your heart you hate them hate them I despise them my heart yeah hate that person not one of you would raise your hand but if you was to say how many of you could raise your hand and say within your mind there's someone that really gets on your nerves my wife isn't here so she can't nudge me so that's good and you've had a nil thought towards somebody else within the assembly all of us would raise our hands why because we are humans but now the danger is this if you don't take care of that thought by the word of God and forgive that person when that thought goes from the mind to the heart sin is conceived now let's take the scripture for it there's Judas Iscariot it was in his mind all the time that at how we might uh uh you know uh give the Lord up for ransom it was in his mind he was thinking about it a lot even when he was approached about it it was still in his mind no doubt he was torn wetter to do it or not but the Bible says when Satan entered into the heart of Judas Iscariot that's when he went and betrayed the Lord and so the sin when it reaches to the heart of the person that's when it conceives sin and When sin is conceived it brings forth death so God help us the importance of protecting our minds the importance of thinking good things about one another the importance of thinking upon those things which are pure those things which are holy those things which are of a good report those things which make you feel good in the word Lord help us to think upon these things because when we think upon these things and it goes down into our heart it'll bring forth life it'll bring forth righteousness it'll bring forth forgiveness so when we forgive one another from our hearts and not just our minds what happens the Bible says that when you forgive that God will heal our diseases too much of the time if we have something in our heart no matter what it may be if we don't forgive for that situation God cannot heal our diseases you see the importance so now we take a very simple thought a very simple quotation of thinking on good things and a very simple quotation on if it's bad it's from Satan but we can take it now and we can break that thing down and realize hey this is actually important for my well-being it's important for my well-being and my mental health as a person but not only as a person but as a believer in God applying the word to my situation Hallelujah but the longer that we Fester on things and the longer we think upon things in our minds the greater it becomes the greater the complex becomes and it turns from a complex and a hatred now how do we get this out of our heart it'll take something very special from God to do it but you need and I need to do my due diligence and realize on a daily basis that my thoughts are speaking louder than heaven then my words are here upon Earth there's some people who are just very naturally gifted at forgiving others there is I could name I could name a handful right now and I won't do it because I won't embarrass anybody but there's some hey guess what we just hold grudges Amos said yeah right so everybody's thinking the old grudges he's actually one That Forgives it's true this guy that he somebody says sorry he's over it and I'm thinking to myself how is that possible it's a Godly attribute further on is the same way remember it's just so people from Ireland they really need that I'm thinking how does he do it it's not possible some of us are Grudge holders and God really had to work on me to stop holding grudges that you gotta learn to let go of the thing because as long as you're holding a grudge it keeps you in prison and captive and so I had to learn by holding grudges and how it made me feel that I had to let go of it you don't understand Brothers thinking sure I do all of us understand because we all deal with it so it's important for us there's gold there's this this this mind that we have is so important for us to protect it and to be careful what we LED because the mind is the womb to the God help us okay let's move on secondly is the breast and arms of silver to me when I think about it I think of money and I think of wealth and I think of bright and shiny things back then they used silver for money he's got two arms how many of us welcome money with two arms I love it so much that I want two arms and I'm gonna hold it real tight to my chest silver the Love of Money the love of money is the what it is the root of all evil why is it the root cause of all evil just ask our president and his son they'll tell you because they'll do evil things for the love nobody ties their hand behind their back when someone offers them money put whatever you can in my pocket no give it to me I want as much of this that I can hold why because it's precious to me notice it wasn't only the arms but it was the chest area too many Believers are holding money so close to their chest that is the most important thing to them in their lives now there's some of you that have the character enough to to take care of that thing and I said God bless you not talking about everybody I'm just talking about those who have hundred dollar character you give them an arm full of money guess what happens they blow it all their character really shows through shiny things what's shiny materialistic I just won I just want the bigger house if I can make this amount of money I'd be happy you get to that point you're not happy if I could just have a bigger car if I could just have this if I could just have that oh I'd be so happy and you realize when you get there you're not happy everybody remember amnam's friend when I preached on it when I am them got what he wanted his hatred for his sister was greater than the love that he had for her he wanted it he wanted it so bad and when he got the shiny materialistic things he realized and he said oh I hate it I don't want this this is not what I wanted but they think that they want more if I could just get more I'd be happy if I could just have something shinier I'd be happy if I could just have something greater and something better and I'll work for it I'll be so happy but when you get there you realize this is not making me happy there's one thing in a believer's life that'll make you happy and satisfied and that's a closer walk with God and that's more Revelation with God though that is the thing that we should be chasing after that is the thing that we should be spending our time after as a closer walk with God where'd it go it's gone you know God can do with you what he did to these Empires Take It All Away he'll take you through the school of humility [Laughter] oh it's not a good it's not a good school to go through but let me tell you every son and daughter of God has to go through it do you know why because we're made in the image of this guy proud arrogant full of gold and precious metals God will take you through a school you know wipe your feet from below you take all this stuff away and that'll humble you he won't humiliate you God's business and his school is not a school of humiliation Satan wants to humiliate you before everybody but God wants to Humble you through humility through his school of Trials and testings amen so thirdly we find uh you know the more I read this the more I realize this I do believe that this statue that Nebuchadnezzar was Irish huh maybe these are the things I deal with I don't know this is a good one thirdly is the belly of brass the King was Alexander the Great who was a great man of military might Alexander the Great was a great conqueror he was a great military man who took over the kingdom of Greece from his father Philip when he was 20 years old and he went on a rampage going through the Empire of Persia defeating Army after Army after Army for 12 years he fought and he battled throughout the Empire of Persia and he took it over so what is this brass resemble for us in this day brass you can think of brass I think of bullets I think of War I think of fighting I think of bickering I think of a person that's full of brass that they do nothing they just want to fight all the time they just want to bicker with their loved ones they're not happy unless there's some kind of argument going on in the house they're not happy unless they're at fisty cuffs with somebody they're not happy unless they're at odds with somebody else in the church what's wrong with this picture they got too much brass in their lives you know it's a prideful thing to always want to be right you really that's what arguments are all about it's two people arguing because one thinks they're right and the other one thinks they're right and no none of them will back down oh make me less of a man if I back down I'm a fighter let me tell you something I'm from Ireland do you know my family history a bunch of carnality that's why we got a bunch of carnality amongst our families is because not one either one will humble themselves and say what'd you say what I said I'm sorry I was wrong the issue is pride so what God has to do with us and our families is that God has to take us through the school of humility and he has to let you be wrong for you to realize that you were wrong so that you would come back and say I'm sorry because the Bible says let not the sun go down on your wrath in other words make it right make it right before you go to bed make it right before you go to sleep when you wake up in the morning everything should be okay might take a couple of days for some of you the issue is brass in your life some of us need to get rid of the brass in our lives we're going to find out that this whole statue we read it earlier this whole statue gets smoked by something remember the statute resembles your carnal man but there's something that comes along and Strikes this guy Hallelujah fourthly is the legs and feet of iron with also the feet of clay this is the Roman Empire the worst and harshest of all these kingdoms now when I think of iron I immediately think of the sentence ruling with the rod of iron I think of rulership I think of dictatorship I think of somebody that's pretty forceful I think of somebody that says it's it's my way or it's the highway I think of a minister who beats the people I think of a minister who says if you leave my church it's over for you you're gone you get out of you get out of my church uh you're out of the will of God let me tell you that's wrong you ever see that video of that preacher and and he's he's just calling people out all over the place and he goes up to this guy he says you yeah you you stand up stand up yeah you you shouldn't have married her and your life is a wrecking and all that he's saying this before all the people and this is a big guy he goes and this this past he's like yeah give me a hug you know I love you love is corrective but only when it's brought with the right intent and motive a man who is ruling either in his household or amongst the church where the rod of iron has the wrong motive and the wrong intent for the people because he doesn't want what's best for them you'll do what I say whether you like it or not you better get away from a preacher like that you better get away from a pastor like that let me tell you if me or brother Ron ever get like that he better make like a tree and leave that be in your best interests why because that's what the Catholic Church did the Catholic Church they ruled with the rod of iron they put fear in the people to make the people come into line through fear I thought love and fear couldn't exist at the same time because where love is it casts out what all fear not just fear all fear so what they did was they brought the people through fear and trembling and you better do what you're told are else I don't believe that that's a way that we should raise our family because if you raise a family through fear that's how they look to God and they think well God is like that and every single mistake that I make oh I'm going to be ruled with the rod of iron our heavenly father isn't like that our heavenly father is a corrective father but as a correct through love it is a correctiveness through the love of God help us to love one another through good motives good intentions through love and corrective not with a rod of iron an exposition of the seven Church ages brother Branham said this Roman Empire of iron iron signifying power and great destructive force against opposition nothing stood in their way was to be made of two main divisions and it certainly was for the Empire literally split into two east and west both were very powerful crushing all before them but as the glory and power of all Empires fall so this Empire began to fall also thus Rome fell Pagan Imperial Rome was no longer iron she crumbled she was wounded to death Rome could not now rule it was all over so thought the world but how wrong the world was for that head Rome though wounded was not wounded unto death Revelations 13 13 says and one of the heads of his heads appeared to have been mortally wounded the throat haven't been slashed and his Deathstroke was healed and the people uh where am I here and the people of the whole earth I totally just got lost and the whole earth followed after the wild beast in amazement wow talk about humility I guess I needed to be humbled here for a second is it time for church where are we at people look at Rome they look at the Nash the nation of Italy and as they look they do not realize that wrong with their strict confines where the pope has an actual area as his domain is literally a nation within a nation and she has ambassadors and receives ambassadors papal false Christian Rome she is even called The Eternal City how Blasphemous Now controls by religion even more ably than when Pagan Imperial Rome controlled by the pure iron of force Rome took on a new lease of life when Constantine joined church and state and backed the Union by force the spirit that motivated Pagan Rome is the Same Spirit that now motivates false Christian Rome you can see that is so because you now know that the fourth Empire never went out of existence it just changed in its outer texture so we find out that Pagan Rome she fell like all the other nations and Empires that went before her but she wasn't done yet because through Constantine now marrying church and state together it brought a union and through this union now it revived the life that was within this Roman Empire and so brother Brown and we know that through the Dark Ages there was 68 million Martyrs that were killed notice why they were killed in the name of religion unless you bow down look at the rod of iron now unless you bow down unless you uh worship how we worship unless you recant and you say that the pope is the Vicar of Christ and all these different things you will be put to death you'll do as you're told whether you like it or not and what happened now is she's been ruling the world since this Roman Empire began at the time of Jesus because remember Jerusalem and the Jews they were always looking for the Messiah to come and to rescue them from the Romans but that one fell but now that same spirit is still ruling the people until the second coming of Christ ruling with fear we don't serve God because of fear we should never preach a fearful message because that's not what brother Branham preached we preach love because when you fall in love with Christ guess what everything else just Falls in line so now we realize that Satan has had six thousand years to perfect this image that we've been looking at this morning and one thing that he has perfected very well is within our humanity is our human abilities each of you have a human ability that you were born with something that you're very natural at something that you are very good at now what happens is we begin to depend too much Upon Our human abilities rather than the word of God and so that's what Satan has done through six thousand years now which started in the head is ends up in the feet he has started this perfecting this image of a carnal man a carnal man that'll survive anything that's thrown at him I can survive anything you throw anything at me all over come and I'll get on with it I don't need nothing I don't need nobody's help yeah that's the thought of Satan because within ourselves our ability is zero when it comes to the eyes of God people have said that Christians are weak people and it's true I humble myself this morning and I say I'm so weak that I can't even walk a single step that I need him to carry me on the footsteps of time so we find now that Satan has had this uh six thousand years to perfect this carnal man he has us relying on our finances he has us relying Upon Our abilities as a as a human being he has us relying on all of our natural elements with that this uh human man can can bring forth I guess would be a good way to put on it but yet in the eyes of God that doesn't mean nothing God doesn't want your abilities but God wants your heart we are now back to the time of Babel and of nimrod where the very desires of their hearts they were able to accomplish whatever they wanted to build they were able to build it whatever they wanted to do they were able to do they were all of one language and they were all of One Accord and there was nothing that they were not able to do or conquer that's where we are today in laodiacia look at the science look at the wonderful things that science is able to do and some of these things will praise the Lord I tell you what I'm thankful for the things that we can do in science because some of our kids would not be alive if it wasn't for scientific research and what they can do but now if we're depending upon the science and effort depending upon the abilities of humanity it takes our dependence off of God and that's what Satan as the musicians come this morning we'll bring this to a close we realize that that's not the end of this statue it's not the end of the dream but there was a stone the Bible said that this Stone was tuned out of a mountain not by hands it was the stone that the builders rejected that has now become the Chief Cornerstone Jesus Christ and so we find that when we read about this stone that it dashed this image into pieces that the pieces of this image went throughout all the Earth there was no Landing spots for it it was like the dust on a thrashing floor what is this showing to us that this rock this revelation of Jesus Christ of who he is in this day it needs to come into our lives and it needs to absolutely smash the image of our carnal man Satan has had six thousand years to perfect this guy six thousand years perfecting his human abilities six thousand years showing him what he needs to do and rely upon and so on and so forth but when it comes to God our natural abilities as a man counts as absolutely nothing it counts as so much that he strikes the image and that image is no more seen but there's an image now that erects it turns from a stone into a big old mountain what is that mountain that New Jerusalem the city of God what is God wanting to do with us he's wanting to crush us through the school of humility he's wanting to crush us of our carnal man he's wanting to crush us of the things that we rely on in order for Christ now that rock that Revelation to make itself manifested into a mountain that the old Earth can look to and see but it only comes through a school we often say I want to be like Jesus oh to be like Jesus all I want to be is just like him Jesus though he was found in the fashion of a man going back to my original scripture [Music] yet he humbled himself you want to be like Jesus you gotta humble yourself [Music] you want to be like Jesus you need to humble yourself of the brass in your life you gotta humble yourself of always wanting to be right in every situation you want to be like Jesus you got to go through the school of humility because Jesus learned obedience through what the things that he suffered he learned obedience to the word by going through this school of humility [Music] you want to say School of Hard Knocks people take Hard Knocks but yet they're never humble after it we man brother Michael were fellowshipping in the back office and we're talking about these things I said did you read my notes of what I'm wanting to get into he said no but he's in the channel [Music] this is different than the School of Hard Knocks because people that go through a School of Hard Knocks they become hard their heart is not tender their spirit is not soft in Ireland we say that person had a hard paper around when they were younger why because they've been through the School of Hard Knocks and through the knocks of life and through the knocks of school of this school guess what happens it's written all over them God's School of humility this is what I want to get into it is not to humiliate you it is not to make you hard in spirit or heart but as to make you humble because brother Branham said that God dwells in humility you say well brother Stephen I don't want to go through that school I don't think I need to get rid of some of that Pride [Music] what are the people going to think in church when they see me going through this school lay down your pride who cares what other people think when God is doing a work in your life it doesn't matter what anybody else says so this school that every born-again believer must go through why must I go through it because my carnal man has been perfected over 6 000 years and God doesn't want me to be a carnal man anymore but he wants to crush the image so that the image of Christ might be made known to everyone around us God bless you this morning I appreciate your patience we went a little slow and that's okay [Music] I failed to go slow this morning so much of the time we can get caught up with preaching and you got to preach it and you got to preach it well when you preach it those who perhaps are younger ones or those that are new amongst us they're not quite catching what is being said but when you slow down a little bit and you explain yourself a little bit better I feel it's easier to catch and if I'm being quite honest it's because of my own inabilities to teach slower the better going to church saints of God is not a race like the hair and the Tortoise it's not a race it doesn't matter who finished his first it doesn't matter that's what the hair thought it doesn't matter if you catch things a little slowly it doesn't matter if we're not jumping and hooting and hollering it's okay listen to the word that's being preached because it's the word that has an effect in our lives not the emotion so now I want you all to go home this evening today I want you to read Daniel chapter 2. and I want you to remind yourself of these different symbols of what we talked about this morning perhaps when you read it you'll see something a little different of what gold means you'll see something a little different of what silver means you'll see something a little different and let the Holy Spirit now deal with your heart and say this is the silver the brass the clay this is the iron that's in my life that I need to take care of this is what I need to take care of in my life and watch the Holy Spirit now take care of that thing that's powerheads Heavenly Father we certainly thank you Lord for this opportunity to be in your house and your word Lord is a a lamp unto our feet and I thank you that father your
