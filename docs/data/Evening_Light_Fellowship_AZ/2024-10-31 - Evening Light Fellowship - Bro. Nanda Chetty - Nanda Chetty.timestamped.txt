[47:54] be seated you'll have to bear with me I
[47:58] Don't Preach in English at my place I
[48:01] preach in French before I'm like trying
[48:04] in my mind to translate the words from
[48:06] French to English and then but I believe
[48:10] that my accent is good enough for you to
[48:13] understand what I'm saying amen before I
[48:16] begin with the word I don't want to be
[48:18] long I know I know it's a Wednesday
[48:20] service and since I've got one service
[48:23] with you I would like just to share a
[48:26] few thoughts that might be a blessing to
[48:28] you that's how we want at the end of the
[48:29] day to be a blessing to
[48:31] you and uh I would sing a song that I
[48:35] think I sang that song the last time to
[48:39] express my testimony how I was healed of
[48:42] asthma I was dying with asthma at the
[48:45] age of 16 and God healed me for the
[48:48] first time I went to a Christian meeting
[48:50] I never knew the Bible I've never read
[48:51] that book before I was a Tamil a Hindu
[48:54] by religion I was worshiping
[48:57] gods and I came across the Bible at the
[48:59] age of 16 and God healed me from asthma
[49:03] chronic asthma condition and that's
[49:06] where that song was a blessing to me I I
[49:11] teach you a it's only little verse but
[49:13] it's going to be
[49:17] good I believe that God will help us
[49:19] tonight for I seeing that song said the
[49:21] words are very simple he is an answering
[49:24] God when I prayed in Jesus name and said
[49:28] then by faith the answer came if I can
[49:31] yeah if I can get the guitar fine
[49:35] just yeah I sing I'm sure you are ready
[49:40] for the
[49:41] word and I'm very happy you know
[49:44] what I'm not saying it because he's in
[49:47] front of me uh he has been a mentor to
[49:51] me over the years I'm telling you
[49:52] honestly when I came to the message I
[49:54] was very confused
[49:57] I was under the leadership of a man you
[49:59] know leadership of men brings
[50:01] fear and I I had a very I wanted to
[50:05] commit
[50:06] suicide I had
[50:09] schizophrenia I went to my psychiatrist
[50:11] I told him I'm going to kill myself it
[50:13] was I was taking anti-depressant tablets
[50:17] I was having strange feelings and like
[50:20] electric nerves going through my body I
[50:22] would rush to the toilet I would
[50:25] scream oh open the door of my car and
[50:28] throw myself on the road wanted to kill
[50:31] myself because I was fighting this
[50:33] message for I'm telling that to those
[50:35] who are new who never knew me I fought
[50:37] the message of the hour for 9 years very
[50:39] harsh I pulled people out of the message
[50:43] because the message was a threat to me I
[50:46] thought it was of the devil I even
[50:48] translated a missionary from America
[50:51] from Baytown Texas he was my missionary
[50:55] I was a UPC ordained minister those days
[50:59] and he would be saying brother Bram is a
[51:02] devil and I would translate in French
[51:05] what he saying and my church will be
[51:08] very happy they will all run around was
[51:10] crying hollering brother Bram is a devil
[51:13] brother Bram is a false prophet because
[51:15] I couldn't I couldn't figure out
[51:18] how the supper had an affair with Eve
[51:22] the serpent seed was something very
[51:24] difficult for me to to swallow can you
[51:27] understand what I'm
[51:28] saying I fought the message for 9 years
[51:31] and then God had a way to teach me thank
[51:34] you Lord I felt sick very bad I couldn't
[51:37] I couldn't even look at my wife hear my
[51:40] wife speak to me I couldn't hear my
[51:42] children scream around playing around I
[51:44] would take pillows and try to put around
[51:47] my ears and that's how bad it
[51:50] was then I came from a long trip a
[51:54] Non-Stop trip from home Hong Kong it was
[51:58] the 2nd March of 1993 was the Tuesday
[52:01] after 10 hours nonstop I reach home very
[52:05] early in the morning and uh I began to
[52:08] give gifts to my wife my children at
[52:10] night at 10:30 I remember I was
[52:13] crying I was under that attack again
[52:16] depressive you know then I said to my
[52:18] wife I'm going back to church she told
[52:21] me church after 5 years you have been
[52:24] backsliding you didn't know where you
[52:26] going going that night which church are

[52:31] amen and on the 7th March it was a
[52:34] Sunday I found myself in a message
[52:37] church thank you Lord till today amen
[52:40] thank you Jesus I I never had any regret
[52:42] of me being in the in the message
[52:44] church and uh and then uh what happened
[52:49] maybe a couple of years I was under a
[52:52] Ministry I wanted who he was I was
[52:55] really burdened I I went to church and I
[52:58] was shocked by the way the pastor was
[53:02] expressing himself the way he was
[53:04] teaching the people he believed at one
[53:07] time he he was the prophet in the
[53:08] Rapture would be taking place here right
[53:10] in this building you know and then all
[53:12] and I was really really shocked and I

[1:00:14] I I I like where I go for the first time
[1:00:17] I like to introduce something to you
[1:00:20] very quick that would be like you know
[1:00:22] when when those football players they
[1:00:24] get on the ground they had a war ing up
[1:00:26] first you know we have to warm ourselves
[1:00:28] before there's a scripture that we as
[1:00:31] Pentecostal we I I we we used to like
[1:00:34] when I was there in 2 Timothy chapter 1
[1:00:39] verse 7 it would say this for God has
[1:00:43] not given us the spirit of
[1:00:45] fear but of power the moment we heard
[1:00:48] power we all shout as Pentecostal you
[1:00:51] know but I want you to read the verse
[1:00:54] carefully he said
[1:00:56] but of power and of love and of a sound
[1:01:01] mind then verse eight he said be not
[1:01:04] thou
[1:01:06] therefore I was taught by my missionary
[1:01:10] a long time ago he said when you see
[1:01:12] that word therefore you should stop and
[1:01:15] see why is therefore
[1:01:18] amen that's right that word therefore is
[1:01:23] is linked with what he said before
[1:01:27] we have received a spirit of power of
[1:01:30] love and of a sound mind therefore
[1:01:33] because we have received that therefore
[1:01:37] be not
[1:01:39] ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord but
[1:01:43] there's a
[1:01:44] comma where there's a comma the the the
[1:01:47] the sentence continues amen know of me
[1:01:51] yeah therefore we should not be ashamed
[1:01:54] to give testimony of of the Lord amen
[1:01:57] because people would say you just talk
[1:01:59] about brother Bram every time amen every
[1:02:02] time you talk you say brother Bram said
[1:02:04] this brother Brown said it is that this
[1:02:06] Christ has been put aside but Paul said
[1:02:08] he's saying here amen you've received
[1:02:10] the spirit of power of a sound mind of
[1:02:12] Love Therefore yes be not ashamed to
[1:02:16] talk about the about about the Lord yes
[1:02:20] come neither of me right not that Paul
[1:02:24] is trying to align me himself with Jesus

[1:10:51] hypocrite that's all religion is just a
[1:10:54] bunch of faith
[1:10:56] fanaticism and so M said
[1:11:00] look I'm dying maybe she was sleeping
[1:11:04] like that in this in this in a position

[1:18:48] okay let
[1:18:48] [Music]
[1:18:50] me read those
[1:18:53] scripture it was I know I now that I'm
[1:18:56] preaching I know I won't I won't end the
[1:19:00] message your pastor told me to come
[1:19:02] again we see we'll try
[1:19:05] something he told me when I come you
[1:19:07] must preach Friday Saturday and Sunday
[1:19:13] yes that's it was the the story the
[1:19:17] thing that helped me a lot along my way
[1:19:19] in the message of the hour because I was
[1:19:23] criticizing the prophet the message
[1:19:26] saying all kinds of bad
[1:19:28] things the Lord opened my eyes and let
[1:19:30] me saw even brother Bram in the
[1:19:33] scripture I don't have time this time
[1:19:36] but I saw the prophet's life in many
[1:19:39] scriptures many stories in the Bible
[1:19:43] That's why that expression which I like
[1:19:46] to preach all over where I go he said
[1:19:48] when those angels paragraph 43 the Feast
[1:19:51] of the trumpets preach 9th of July 64
[1:19:55] 19th July 64 he said when those angels
[1:19:58] met me and opened those Seven Seas the
[1:20:02] Bible has become a new
[1:20:05] Bible the problems today is that we are
[1:20:07] going we are still reading the Bible
[1:20:10] with the eyes of the theologians with
[1:20:13] the eyes of the teaching that we had
[1:20:15] before even in Pentecost we have to just
[1:20:18] let go of everything of the now we are
[1:20:22] reading from a new Bible we want to read
[1:20:25] from the new Bible the Bible had become
[1:20:27] become a new
[1:20:28] Bible therefore that that story
[1:20:32] here it was uh the
[1:20:39] unic he always stressed on Phillip I was
[1:20:42] asking myself why brother bam would take
[1:20:45] Phillip when he talks about Phillip was
[1:20:47] having a great Revival there in
[1:20:50] Samaria therefore he was having a great
[1:20:52] Revival there was the lame was walking
[1:20:54] the demons who were been cast out he a
[1:20:58] big healing comping he said God will
[1:21:00] remove him from there from that Big
[1:21:04] Revival to bring him to a one one man to
[1:21:07] men one single soul and an angel will be
[1:21:13] taking him away it was the the angel the
[1:21:18] and his commission unto me an angel was
[1:21:21] sent to Commission philli he will take
[1:21:25] him away from a Big Revival of numbers
[1:21:29] healing Revival and everything to bring
[1:21:32] him to his soul to
[1:21:34] one that's the message of the hour no
[1:21:38] more the first and second P like the 10
[1:21:41] vision is a onetoone affair God is
[1:21:44] dealing with one to
[1:21:46] one therefore when I was looking at that
[1:21:48] I was seeing even the the prophet that's
[1:21:50] why he was always talking about that man
[1:21:53] because it was his ministry
[1:21:55] yeah he said that in the body at that
[1:21:58] moment I'm talking about among the mixed
[1:22:00] C in the body at that moment there was
[1:22:03] only one man who had seed it was Philip
[1:22:07] because he had seed he could go and put
[1:22:10] seed in the unic that's right because
[1:22:12] the unic had no seed of himself God now
[1:22:17] changed his ministry from a big campaign
[1:22:21] Revival sending him in the third po to
[1:22:24] an individual Affair amen amen he sent
[1:22:27] it to one man and he was having a great
[1:22:29] Revival at such a point that there was a
[1:22:33] man he was a sorcerer Simon yeah when he
[1:22:38] saw the gift of speaking tongue the
[1:22:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost he wanted that
[1:22:42] gift he wanted to pay because he was
[1:22:44] rich he was rich that was L this year
[1:22:48] right going after the
[1:22:50] gifts looking for the gift and he had
[1:22:53] money to pay for that yeah but he was a
[1:22:56] sorcery in the vision of the Bride
[1:22:58] brother said now that I noticed there
[1:23:02] were naked that is Le DEA right said
[1:23:05] have you noticed that church was guided
[1:23:08] was led by was a
[1:23:12] witch that was
[1:23:14] Leia with Simon the Sorcerer Pentecostal
[1:23:18] AG I'm
[1:23:20] sorry I'm being BL to you
[1:23:25] Pentecostalism has even begin to sleep
[1:23:28] in the message of
[1:23:29] the I've been there for a long time I
[1:23:33] know that movement yes it's so close
[1:23:37] that he can deceive the very
[1:23:40] El therefore therefore God now took that
[1:23:45] the angel took philli brought him down
[1:23:47] to the unit said he he he was coming
[1:23:50] from a from the from Pentecost he was
[1:23:54] coming from from a bunch of doctors but
[1:23:57] there then but then even he came from
[1:23:59] them a bunch of doctors in the world he
[1:24:03] was
[1:24:04] confused because when he was reading the
[1:24:06] Bible the Bible was still the old Bible
[1:24:09] he came from the School of Theology he
[1:24:12] couldn't understand what he was reading
[1:24:14] that's why God now displaced himself
[1:24:18] from the great Revival because the
[1:24:19] ministry is changing for for Phillip
[1:24:22] it's no more the crowd God is sending
[1:24:25] him for the commissioning of an Angel to
[1:24:28] one to one to Open the Eyes of the man
[1:24:32] could understand the scripture now he's
[1:24:34] reading from a new
[1:24:36] book lord he takes the book while he's
[1:24:39] reading Philip now the French word is
[1:24:42] nice sorry
[1:24:44] brother the French word is very said
[1:24:48] apost come near The Chariot the word por
[1:24:54] it in French is like
[1:24:56] Kinsman God had to send us a
[1:25:00] Kinsman at the end time somebody that
[1:25:03] would come near to us to be able to
[1:25:06] redeem us the Redemption comes through a
[1:25:08] kinsman's
[1:25:10] redem God has to send that man who was
[1:25:12] far away in big campaigns he brought him
[1:25:16] near to The Chariot said come near there
[1:25:20] right then he asked them man do you
[1:25:22] understand what you're reading say how
[1:25:23] can I
[1:25:24] unless a
[1:25:26] guide he was confessing now that he
[1:25:29] needs a guide and God sent us a guide in
[1:25:32] this generation that's why they they
[1:25:34] title a guide because we could never
[1:25:37] understand scriptures unless God sent
[1:25:40] that guy brother Bram I'm saying it
[1:25:42] right brother Bram was a guy that God
[1:25:45] sent to us for us to understand the
[1:25:47] scripture prise the Lord now we are
[1:25:49] reading from a new book new
[1:25:52] interpretation of the Bible you know got
[1:25:54] many kind of translations of the Bible
[1:25:56] you I don't know uh new internal version
[1:25:59] King James version It's called
[1:26:04] version but the best translation is the
[1:26:07] new
[1:26:08] Bible from the message of the
[1:26:11] [Applause]
[1:26:13] hour the voice said can you and that's
[1:26:16] somebody now what you was reading he was
[1:26:19] reading Isaiah
[1:26:22] 53 which is the I'm sorry my watch is
[1:26:24] very funny he saying you're falling or
[1:26:27] you having a heart attack
[1:26:30] I I have to
[1:26:38] remove the devil can talk for your for
[1:26:41] your
[1:26:42] wife have some negative thoughts you
[1:26:45] what
[1:26:47] I she was reading not understanding the
[1:26:50] scripture that was our problem we was
[1:26:52] reading confused with all kinds of
[1:26:55] translation with all kinds of
[1:26:57] interpretation God has to set us a guide
[1:26:59] in this
[1:27:01] generation in the person of brother
[1:27:03] William Bram and then he said no that he
[1:27:06] was reading what he was reading the
[1:27:08] first part of redemption which was the
[1:27:11] crucifixion you know John was in with
[1:27:14] Mary in front of the Cross he saw the
[1:27:16] blood dripping up from the cross he saw
[1:27:19] the blood coming from the from the from
[1:27:21] the head of Jesus Christ when when they
[1:27:23] put the th and and and the side he was
[1:27:26] be he saw the blood as Pentecost I
[1:27:29] remember very well we disclaim the blood
[1:27:31] everywhere we go we go when we reach
[1:27:33] home we put our hands on the door the
[1:27:35] blood of Jesus Christ the blood the
[1:27:36] blood the blood the blood we just repeat
[1:27:39] the blood if time that's not the blood
[1:27:43] what happened he was reading the first
[1:27:45] part of redemption and John saw but yet
[1:27:48] when he came when he
[1:27:51] went uh after the cing of time past time
[1:27:55] he was he was
[1:27:57] weeping because because the book was
[1:27:59] still closed he knew even if the blood
[1:28:03] was was was was poured out there that
[1:28:05] was the first part of redemption yes
[1:28:08] that was the paying of the price but the
[1:28:10] claiming B was to come
[1:28:13] after why he was he was
[1:28:17] weeping so that's what if Philip was
[1:28:20] being used for the past first part of
[1:28:22] redemption God said un the guide in this
[1:28:24] end time Amen to open our eyes
[1:28:27] concerning the second part which is the
[1:28:29] claiming part God has come to claim us
[1:28:32] back he said we were sealed in that book
[1:28:37] paragra I think 75 the breach we were
[1:28:40] seal in there but when the book was open
[1:28:43] then we came out we were lose from
[1:28:45] hallelujah amen the what hinder
[1:28:50] you when the Philip should have
[1:28:53] introduced to him the Plan of Salvation
[1:28:57] because then why would he say well there
[1:28:59] is
[1:29:00] water he knew Philip T him that also to
[1:29:03] be saved like like Peter told there
[1:29:05] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:29:08] the Lord Jesus Christ and you see the
[1:29:09] gift of the Holy Ghost therefore he knew
[1:29:11] that the plan Philip was expressing was
[1:29:14] expounding on everything every detail
[1:29:17] about the Plan of Salvation and then
[1:29:19] maybe in his heart now he was saying oh
[1:29:22] my if only I could get a to place where
[1:29:24] there is water but he was in a desert
[1:29:27] the most improbable place to have water
[1:29:31] right but look when there's a desire in
[1:29:33] your heart a deep desire in your heart
[1:29:36] and a true desire blessed desire God
[1:29:39] Will Make A Way even if the situation is
[1:29:42] not there God Will Make A Way in the
[1:29:44] desert where there is no water because
[1:29:46] the Deep was calling to the Deep there
[1:29:48] was a deep to respond to the deep that
[1:29:53] was because the desire was there to be
[1:29:55] baptized God in that desert created a
[1:29:58] pool of water deep enough for him to be
[1:30:01] baptized and God can do the same thing
[1:30:04] for you it's only for you to express the
[1:30:06] desire from the bottom of your heart
[1:30:08] Lord I want this which is something
[1:30:10] scriptural which is something according
[1:30:12] to his will when you express the desire
[1:30:14] of God will make a way where there is no
[1:30:21] way and the other one is Galatians when
[1:30:23] Paul would be saying to them you were
[1:30:25] running well what happened you what did
[1:30:29] who did hinder you now I I need to get
[1:30:31] to my
[1:30:35] text that's why I tell you we would
[1:30:39] never have seen what he T by brother
[1:30:44] sister that's right you were our
[1:30:47] eyes in the message that's why I'm going
[1:30:50] to close after 1 hour
[1:30:57] the message persever when I was reading
[1:30:59] that that's why you never read the
[1:31:01] message like a newspaper don't do that
[1:31:04] never that's right read it
[1:31:07] carefully because it's our manner it's
[1:31:10] our Heavenly
[1:31:11] manner he said in the message
[1:31:14] perseverant fish Mark
[1:31:17] 64 paragraph 7 you said I'm sorry I had
[1:31:20] to drink some water because I'm dry in
[1:31:22] the desert here I feel like my my my
[1:31:25] tongue is
[1:31:29] dry you know why I asked you that
[1:31:31] because I I was shocked when I saw
[1:31:33] brother BR in one of the
[1:31:35] courts he was like that he was
[1:31:39] thirsty I was I wept when I ran there
[1:31:42] when I listened to the he was thirsty
[1:31:44] but he was he couldn't take the water he
[1:31:47] was like hesitating then he said he said
[1:31:49] I'm sorry I see all of you fing your
[1:31:52] heart and me drinking water in front of
[1:31:55] you might really hurt you but please let
[1:31:58] me take a sip of

[1:32:07] water this Greek parag this Greek had
[1:32:12] heard these words that is the cenan
[1:32:14] woman look at the eyes of a prophet now
[1:32:18] she believed it she had many hindrances
[1:32:23] but her faith didn't have
[1:32:27] any faith knows no hindrance am her
[1:32:32] faith had no hindrance she had but her
[1:32:37] faith didn't have you may have
[1:32:40] hindrances but if you got faith it knows
[1:32:44] no defeat it's positive yeah let's look
[1:32:48] at some of her
[1:32:51] hindrances just for a moment that's what
[1:32:54] I like this Prophet I've been reading
[1:32:56] the Bible so many years I've been
[1:32:58] teaching from the Bible I could never
[1:33:01] show those things we need the eye of a
[1:33:04] prophet that's why the Bible has become
[1:33:07] a new book he said some of
[1:33:09] them I want you to follow me now might
[1:33:12] have said look at the first hindrance
[1:33:16] she was leaving a a pagan country tired
[1:33:21] inide she was crossing over over into
[1:33:25] into the the land of the Jews the Jewish
[1:33:28] land
[1:33:30] now she was going now for the healing of
[1:33:33] her daughter Cru the fact cruy tormented
[1:33:37] by a devil because she was healing she
[1:33:40] was going forth for a need I want you to
[1:33:42] listen now I don't think I've come here
[1:33:44] for for nothing there should be
[1:33:46] something if I can only reach one person
[1:33:49] tonight I I'd be very happy she was
[1:33:52] coming for a need
[1:33:54] and the devil knows about that she will
[1:33:56] try to throw any kind of hindrance he he
[1:34:00] he would just to stop
[1:34:02] you went into the thought went into the
[1:34:06] the Bible don't describe anything of
[1:34:08] that yes but the Bible has become a new
[1:34:11] book right he said that some of them
[1:34:15] might have said
[1:34:16] remember you are of A different race
[1:34:19] amen cuz she was a Greek you are a Greek
[1:34:24] by Nation but he's a Jew in other words
[1:34:28] today you would say your denominations
[1:34:31] not having this revival it makes no
[1:34:34] difference your denomination whether it
[1:34:36] is or not that woman didn't care whose
[1:34:39] denomination it was she was a human
[1:34:43] being are we human beings yeah she was a
[1:34:47] human being amen had been created by God
[1:34:50] and she had a need do you have a need
[1:34:52] tonight amen she had a need and she had
[1:34:56] faith and she was going to get it
[1:35:00] whether her denomination was cooperating
[1:35:02] or not made her no difference she start
[1:35:06] it off see one of one of the main
[1:35:08] problem Len because I've been faced with
[1:35:10] it that's why I'm telling you tonight
[1:35:13] without I'm not I'm not trying to talk
[1:35:15] to about anybody when I just came the
[1:35:18] message about 3 months after I met with
[1:35:21] someone who was in charge of a
[1:35:24] of a great thing in the message of the
[1:35:27] hour I won tell you you you try to to to
[1:35:30] guess who he is I was young 3 months in
[1:35:33] the message or four months I remember he
[1:35:35] came to
[1:35:36] morish and the way he acted before me
[1:35:39] because he was of under the race I was
[1:35:42] shocked I see I was treated like a
[1:35:47] slave brother I cried I said I just came
[1:35:52] a message that was for me the right
[1:35:54] thing to do but that man so many years
[1:35:58] in the message of the hour and
[1:36:00] representing such a such an office in
[1:36:03] the message of the hour and the way he
[1:36:05] talked to me and he treated me that then
[1:36:08] I've learned something from Brother
[1:36:10] Becket kill them by
[1:36:14] love kill them by Love Therefore I went
[1:36:18] to a shop I bought an expensive souvenir
[1:36:22] very expensive
[1:36:24] yes I gave it to him as a gift amen that
[1:36:27] man crumble to the ground yes he asked
[1:36:31] forgiveness and he became one of my best
[1:36:35] friends praise the Lord amen look
[1:36:39] racism in the message
[1:36:41] Circle you are a cenan he's a Jew he's
[1:36:46] of a higher
[1:36:47] class he said in the the greatest b
[1:36:51] battle ever fought paragraph he said and
[1:36:54] I'm sure that sister Bell loved our Lord
[1:36:58] she was a good woman now she's one of us
[1:37:01] in here we don't have any lines of color
[1:37:05] Yes the family of God doesn't draw lines
[1:37:08] of color whether we are red brown black
[1:37:12] or yellow doesn't matter why whatever it
[1:37:14] is we are brothers and sisters
[1:37:18] in and we love her and we'll miss her
[1:37:22] the Tabernacle how will I miss sister
[1:37:24] Bell them great big Co amens back there
[1:37:28] in the corner and taking her up home she
[1:37:32] would talk about the Lord
[1:37:34] Jesus
[1:37:35] racism that's one of the
[1:37:38] obstacle that prevented that woman from
[1:37:40] going to meet Jesus
[1:37:42] Christ the second said I want you to
[1:37:45] listen to the words carefully she might
[1:37:47] have had another critic the second ones
[1:37:51] that might have met her down the line
[1:37:52] and said why the days of Miracles is
[1:37:56] passed we don't have Miracles no more
[1:37:59] don't don't let the devil tell you that
[1:38:01] at
[1:38:02] any God is still on the scene God is
[1:38:05] still he God still does
[1:38:08] Miracles why the days of Miracles is p
[1:38:10] we don't have Miracles no more that
[1:38:11] could have been a Jew after she got in
[1:38:15] her over this country where Jesus was
[1:38:18] across into Galilee there's a miracle SP
[1:38:21] there's no such a thing still she was
[1:38:24] persistent she was
[1:38:26] persevering the denational barrier
[1:38:29] didn't stop her neither did anything
[1:38:33] sorry
[1:38:35] anything any of them who believe the
[1:38:37] days of Miracles was passed she knew
[1:38:40] different we should know
[1:38:42] different first thing I want you to to
[1:38:46] grasp those the words first thing she
[1:38:50] had something inside of her right
[1:38:54] we we're going to see those words coming
[1:38:56] again therefore what
[1:38:58] was propelling her she had something in
[1:39:02] the eyes of her inside of the criticism
[1:39:06] whatever she was whatever obstacle
[1:39:08] whatever hindrances were put in front of
[1:39:10] her that something was inside of her am
[1:39:14] today I can say if I come to that
[1:39:16] message whe whe what I did
[1:39:19] before I know I'm sad I regret but I
[1:39:22] know that
[1:39:23] there was something inside of us God has
[1:39:27] put a seed there before the foundation
[1:39:30] of the world there would be nothing to
[1:39:33] hinder a True Believer predestinated for
[1:39:36] this hour nothing can hinder Hallelujah
[1:39:40] listen there was something inside of her
[1:39:43] that told her that she would get what
[1:39:46] she asked for Hallelujah whether there
[1:39:49] was those people causing hindrances but
[1:39:52] some was inside of her listen I like
[1:39:59] that she had something I'm telling you
[1:40:02] we had a god of the present day amen do
[1:40:06] you believe
[1:40:08] that don't you worry about what people
[1:40:10] are saying this and that in the Queen of
[1:40:16] Sheba preach 10 J 6 now the little lady
[1:40:21] had some hindrances which is Queen of
[1:40:23] shba
[1:40:23] and every person that tries to come to
[1:40:26] Christ will find
[1:40:28] hindrances let me say it again and every
[1:40:31] person that comes to Christ will find
[1:40:34] hindrances it's everywhere you just
[1:40:37] start it one time and find out start a
[1:40:41] closer walk with God find out what will
[1:40:44] happen just try it the devil is at the
[1:40:47] door to stop you every day but yet I'm
[1:40:50] going to go because my soul seres
[1:40:53] for the Living
[1:40:55] God now that's that was the
[1:40:59] second obstacle I'm sorry I made a move
[1:41:03] that changeed some of my text here let
[1:41:06] me put it back again then he said oh
[1:41:10] people tonight if you can only hold that
[1:41:14] in your heart that God is here to give
[1:41:17] you the desire of your heart amen if you
[1:41:19] will meet his conditions nothing can
[1:41:21] stand amen he said now the Third
[1:41:23] paragraph 76 there might have been a
[1:41:26] bunch of women come to her said look
[1:41:30] sister Leia brother even give her a name
[1:41:35] sister Leia and orever whatever a name
[1:41:39] might have been do you understand that
[1:41:41] your husband will leave you if you do
[1:41:44] this no doubt but what she loved her
[1:41:47] husband but she she couldn't curse or
[1:41:49] bless that what which was in her yes
[1:41:53] there was something inside of her
[1:41:56] something was telling her daughter was
[1:41:59] dying with epilepsy and she had to get
[1:42:02] to Jesus and when she got there
[1:42:05] something was going to take place
[1:42:07] husband or no
[1:42:09] husband God want us to be positive like
[1:42:12] that don't have a negative thought about
[1:42:15] things in the message law preach 15th
[1:42:18] January 55 he said now it's a strange
[1:42:21] thing that this is so much thought of
[1:42:24] people and they say well I'm weak my
[1:42:27] faith is not very much I'm not a very
[1:42:30] good Christian that's just what the
[1:42:33] devil wants you to say you are just
[1:42:36] talking his language right then see you
[1:42:40] must never say that don't never let your
[1:42:44] testimony be negative let it be positive
[1:42:48] all the time you say I am saved I have
[1:42:52] God in my heart I believe him with all
[1:42:55] my heart you believe in Divine Healing
[1:42:58] with all my heart you confess that
[1:43:01] Hallelujah let your testimony always and
[1:43:04] your thoughts everything never permit a
[1:43:07] negative thought to comeing in your mind
[1:43:10] if you can help it when it starts that
[1:43:13] don't entertain it when you say I can't
[1:43:16] help the thought from coming well that's
[1:43:19] that would be like the fer that said he
[1:43:20] couldn't stop the birds from flying over
[1:43:23] his PR but he could choose chop them
[1:43:25] from
[1:43:26] roosting so that's a good thing you see
[1:43:28] you can't help your the thoughts when
[1:43:30] they come but don't entertain them just
[1:43:33] pass it on no sir Jesus Christ is my
[1:43:37] savior All Things Are Mine by God I'm
[1:43:42] going to keep them I'm going to testify
[1:43:44] of them look at David look at at Moses
[1:43:49] before the Egyptians were killed he
[1:43:51] would tell them those Egyptians that you
[1:43:55] see now you will see them no more it was
[1:43:58] having a positive confession David will
[1:44:01] tell Goliath I'm going to slay you I'm
[1:44:03] going to kill you because I a
[1:44:05] circumcised you you cannot treat me like
[1:44:08] that he was confessing something
[1:44:11] positive he knew that God will back up
[1:44:13] his word I don't know about the name of
[1:44:16] that man maybe G he told God if you give
[1:44:19] me the victory over my the battle I'm
[1:44:22] going to fight I'm going to give you the
[1:44:24] first thing that comes out of my house

[1:44:30] only daughter came out running the and

[1:44:40] that comes out of my of my house I'm
[1:44:42] going to sacrifice it for you oh no and
[1:44:45] the daughter could have told the father
[1:44:48] you know it's you who made the vow I'm
[1:44:51] still a virgin I've got me to marry
[1:44:54] maybe later now you want to sacrifice me
[1:44:56] because you made the vow you're the one
[1:44:58] to be to be blamed they she could have
[1:45:01] she could have asked her father let me
[1:45:02] go for three months you know cry over my
[1:45:05] vcy and then she could have gone but
[1:45:08] even the daughter valued a vow she has
[1:45:13] been taught the right thing she valued
[1:45:16] The Vow and that man sacrific his
[1:45:19] daughter because of the vow if a man can

[1:51:07] she had been undergoing all this trouble
[1:51:10] yes she come in front of him then
[1:51:12] finally she arrived where he was I'm
[1:51:15] going to to read a quote don't strumble
[1:51:18] over that quote because I'm going to
[1:51:20] link that quote with that last
[1:51:23] obstacle in a message for me brother

[1:51:30] 5355 is the message of the

[1:51:50] to make our quotation and now I've
[1:51:53] written out on the envelope here that I
[1:51:55] carried the seven compound names of
[1:51:58] Jehovah in other words it was what
[1:52:03] Jehovah is is made up in these seven
[1:52:07] Redemptive names of his yes now look at
[1:52:10] those word now his attitudes toward the
[1:52:14] people from

[1:52:20] Eden that was the story of read
[1:52:23] Redemption because we are out we have we
[1:52:26] have been out of
[1:52:27] Eden that's
[1:52:29] what the the three four four one of the
[1:52:33] three four purpose of God to bring us
[1:52:36] back to
[1:52:38] Eden from

[1:53:05] that trip that that that trip now from
[1:53:10] Eden Back to Eden yes is contained in
[1:53:14] those names yes then he would say the
[1:53:16] first one being Jehovah Gyra right there

[1:53:23] to Ibraham the the the the the ram yes
[1:53:28] the second is Jehovah Rafa he said the
[1:53:32] one the Lord the Healer then he would
[1:53:34] said those two are connected together
[1:53:37] yes because you know why that's why when
[1:53:39] Abraham was asking God you telling me
[1:53:41] I'm going to have a hair to my to to my
[1:53:44] possessions I don't understand how

[1:54:09] get out of the tent get out of these
[1:54:11] five senses then you will see the the
[1:54:14] things of God you will see the promises
[1:54:16] of God get out from under your T when he
[1:54:19] came out then he saw then God show him
[1:54:21] that great you know Vision about the the
[1:54:25] turtle does and whatever the the the the
[1:54:29] the birds do not separate them which is
[1:54:32] the the healing will be in the Old
[1:54:33] Testament and the New Testament and then
[1:54:35] the three
[1:54:37] animals it was the Plan of
[1:54:40] Redemption he said Jehovah Gyra Jehovah
[1:54:44] Rafa then manasa man our Banner Shalom
[1:54:48] our peace Ro Shepherd and then Sid K
[1:54:52] right says and Sh yes the Lord is there
[1:54:55] was the seventh one the last one that is
[1:55:00] all those steps to bring us back to to
[1:55:03] the Garden the last one is Jehovah
[1:55:07] Jehovah
[1:55:08] sh the Lord
[1:55:11] present God will be here in the
[1:55:16] flesh I think you're getting what what
[1:55:18] I'm getting getting to that's why when
[1:55:21] she she the that lady she did those
[1:55:24] seven steps yes and finally she comes
[1:55:28] into God in
[1:55:30] flesh and that was the main hindrance
[1:55:34] yes she said that I've gone through all
[1:55:37] these now I came before The Very one for
[1:55:41] whom I've been suffering all the shame
[1:55:44] I've been suffering now I come in God in
[1:55:47] flesh he's ping me out praise the Lord
[1:55:53] and that's today our problems in the of
[1:55:56] we don't we couldn't understand that
[1:55:59] sorry I'm not I don't believe in the
[1:56:01] dity of brother brother but I do believe
[1:56:05] that God chose a vessel yes an earth
[1:56:09] vessel in these days amen God wanted to
[1:56:12] manifest himself plainly to the people
[1:56:15] as why why would you why would he do
[1:56:17] those demonstration about turning his
[1:56:19] back who is this man right was trying to
[1:56:22] show that the same God that appeared to
[1:56:25] appeared to Abraham there by the T he
[1:56:28] was the same God heating with us fishing
[1:56:31] with people the same go in the flesh but
[1:56:34] people were afraid of the very thing
[1:56:37] that God sent us to save us from this
[1:56:40] Darkness where we were amen when Christ
[1:56:44] left the mountain when he told the
[1:56:46] disciples go I'm going to pray on the
[1:56:49] mountain those scriptures became alive
[1:56:52] and I'm telling you because the Bible
[1:56:53] became a new book when Christ went in
[1:56:55] the mountain by the he went to the r
[1:56:57] birs of Glory he was praying for the
[1:57:00] church during the seven Church ages the
[1:57:02] vot was a church that 10,000 Devils
[1:57:06] swore to drown those people their saes
[1:57:09] were torn up the the the the the the OES
[1:57:14] the OES were broken there was no hope
[1:57:16] for life it's no this here hell the he
[1:57:20] the lead the cover of hell has been Lo
[1:57:23] hell is loose on the earth 10,000 devils
[1:57:27] in those dark times L dark there and
[1:57:30] Christ was in the mountain there 2,000
[1:57:34] years doing intercession for the for the
[1:57:37] for the church yes when he saw that they
[1:57:40] are Bing there will be no hope for them
[1:57:42] he came underwater the fourth night the
[1:57:46] fourth uh watch of the night yes fourth
[1:57:50] is the number of Deliverance yes right
[1:57:53] he was coming for deliverance do you
[1:57:55] believe that that's what he preached and
[1:57:58] then Jesus came and he called he said
[1:58:00] four is the number of Deliverance Israel
[1:58:03] was in Egypt for 400 years then they
[1:58:06] were delivered the three Hebrew children
[1:58:09] the fourth one came yes when Ezekiel
[1:58:14] measured the water for the Revival there
[1:58:16] the vision of the Revival he measured
[1:58:19] the water up to the ankle level and to
[1:58:21] the knee level to the waste level and
[1:58:23] the fourth one was too much water they
[1:58:26] had they they had to to to to
[1:58:28] swim we we've had you know in the
[1:58:32] countdown we've
[1:58:34] had
[1:58:37] what oh my Luther Wesley Pentecost but
[1:58:43] we are above Pentecost we have the word
[1:58:45] of the hour we've had the the the uh the
[1:58:50] the St the
[1:58:52] then the tussle whatever the the husk
[1:58:56] then then the seed again which is the
[1:58:59] fourth change do you believe that we had
[1:59:01] the curtain the the bamboo curtain which
[1:59:05] is the Chinese then the Iron Curtain
[1:59:08] Russia then the purple curtain the
[1:59:11] Catholic church romanism we got a four
[1:59:14] curtain amen beyond the credit over time
[1:59:17] that's where that's where lies our
[1:59:19] deliverance
[1:59:22] number four it has always been like that
[1:59:25] if you read the message the restitution
[1:59:27] of the of the of the Bride tree but the
[1:59:30] Bible said that the first day when when
[1:59:33] Christ was resurrected the first day the
[1:59:35] second day he was dead he was still dead
[1:59:37] Friday he was still dead but the third
[1:59:40] day there was a rumor that he was that
[1:59:43] he was
[1:59:44] alive it's Pentecost a rumor with
[1:59:47] speaking in tongues with noise there was
[1:59:50] noise around you look I'm scared where
[1:59:52] you look at me like that it's in the
[1:59:54] message of Y amen it's in theage of Y
[1:59:59] but the fourth what he appeared unto
[2:00:02] them amen in the room with me don't be
[2:00:05] afraid it was a personal presence of
[2:00:08] Christ at the four and that's what
[2:00:11] happened in this generation yes and that
[2:00:14] lady was coming through all those stages
[2:00:17] of obstacle to finally come in his
[2:00:20] present that's why he said now Christ
[2:00:22] when he was on the mountain he came
[2:00:26] down and that message has been preached
[2:00:28] 12 times look on
[2:00:31] your table 12 times it is I be not
[2:00:37] afraid he's trying to express to them

[2:00:44] it's not a ghost it's me yes but and mo
[2:00:49] amen I'm under the form I've taken on
[2:00:52] the form but it's still me amen I'm

[2:01:33] wrong you have come to church you see
[2:01:36] that is blasting my mind because I like
[2:01:39] to read that that the promise in the
[2:01:41] scripture where two or three are
[2:01:43] gathered in my name and they in the
[2:01:46] midst of you I've come based on that
[2:01:49] scripture is here but look what is

[2:02:20] human being yeah they could realize that

[2:02:34] did I tell you he couldn't even know
[2:02:36] what he tell the lady in front of him
[2:02:38] because you know what it wasn't him it
[2:02:40] was God using a human body am and people
[2:02:44] were afraid of God's Praises among them
[2:02:48] amen can I take one more minute
[2:02:52] said I won't read I won't look he said
[2:02:56] that the P I've got the quote now here
[2:02:59] in one of the early messages faith in
[2:03:02] the sub said the Pentecostal they have
[2:03:05] been looking for a gift of healing for
[2:03:07] many years they have been praying for
[2:03:10] God to send a gift I'm telling you that
[2:03:13] to show you that that we've had God in
[2:03:17] flesh again yes and if you ask me where
[2:03:20] is he today he's you and me amen the
[2:03:24] bride is God in flesh again and people
[2:03:27] don't realize let me show you you are
[2:03:30] the one who be able to give eternal life
[2:03:32] to to one person and get another one
[2:03:35] good Hallelujah that's the power you you
[2:03:38] have in you right now do you believe
[2:03:40] that because you are representing Christ
[2:03:43] on Earth amen you are Christ you are
[2:03:45] Messi yet do you believe that amen
[2:03:48] that's why you must use that power today
[2:03:50] speak things into
[2:03:52] existence and God knows whom to use he
[2:03:56] used brother he used a woman in the
[2:04:00] first instance sister hat right because
[2:04:02] he knew God knew that she would say the
[2:04:05] right thing that's right oh my he said
[2:04:09] that the Pentecostal have been looking
[2:04:12] for a gift of healing we think that the
[2:04:15] gift is a gift like the Pentecostal
[2:04:17] thing a gift is a person yes they have
[2:04:20] been praying for a gift of healing for
[2:04:23] for 40 years he said that God moved the
[2:04:27] orbits I've got the quote I won't read
[2:04:29] it maybe a 76 5th in the said but God
[2:04:33] moved the orits yes 37 years ago and
[2:04:37] gave it to you what was it the birth of
[2:04:40] William brother
[2:04:43] amen count the days it was the birth of
[2:04:47] brother Bram was the gift that God sent
[2:04:50] to the world of the gift is not what we
[2:04:55] thought was a gift it was a person
[2:04:57] that's what Christ would say to the one
[2:04:59] at the well if you know the gift of God
[2:05:03] and who is the one who is asking for
[2:05:05] water you would have asked yourself the
[2:05:09] gift of God God so loved the world that
[2:05:12] he gave amen his only begot son a gift
[2:05:16] is a person amen do you believe that
[2:05:19] amen when the little Dam from the time
[2:05:22] of n she told the the the mistress if my

[2:05:42] master knows there's a prophet there's a
[2:05:45] prophet because a prophet is a gift of
[2:05:47] healing amen there's a prophet there she
[2:05:51] had the exact address the name and she
[2:05:55] he had to go through all the protocol
[2:05:57] you know he had to go his King get a
[2:05:59] letter for from his King to show to the
[2:06:02] king of Israel when the king of Israel
[2:06:04] got the letter he say oh am I he tore
[2:06:07] away his clothing because he went to the
[2:06:10] wrong address the little damel gave the
[2:06:14] right address you know what I when I

[2:06:53] morius I was tired to answer all those
[2:06:57] questions where is morius where is I
[2:07:00] could explain then I I got inspired I
[2:07:03] came the ppit I preach the unknowns of
[2:07:06] the
[2:07:07] Bible and said who knew the man who gave
[2:07:10] his his
[2:07:12] cult to Jesus Christ from him to

[2:08:17] gazi he was the one who took the words
[2:08:20] of the Prophet The Go tell him to deep
[2:08:22] seven times in Jordan therefore the
[2:08:24] healing of
[2:08:26] name was totally
[2:08:29] dependent on the faithfulness of the
[2:08:33] servant who would say what the tape
[2:08:37] say he had to say exactly what the T
