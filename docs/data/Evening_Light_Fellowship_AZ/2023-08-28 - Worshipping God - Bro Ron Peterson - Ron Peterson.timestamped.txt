[36:12] so
[36:25] amen good morning
[36:28] how many of you want to commit your life
[36:30] to The Potter's hand
[36:32] you know what it's it's funny I I've
[36:34] been wrestling to sing this song because
[36:37] I wrote it it was after brother Steve's
[36:39] sermon on Pride
[36:41] and you know what you realize in your
[36:44] testimony that
[36:45] you build up a vessel in your life
[36:48] and then God comes and he breaks it if
[36:50] it's not like him right and
[36:54] um
[36:54] that is something that I I have really
[36:57] just
[36:57] not understood about my life I built my
[37:00] life up it broke and then constantly
[37:02] God's been rebuilding everything that I
[37:04] want to do God leaves me a different way
[37:07] it leads me a different way until you
[37:08] just throw up your hands at the end of
[37:09] the day and you say God whatever you
[37:11] want to do
[37:12] so I pray that this song speaks to you
[37:15] it's got a question at the end that I
[37:18] want you to pay attention to because
[37:20] it's really this is the most important
[37:23] part of our life can we humble ourselves
[37:25] to be used by God can we humble
[37:27] ourselves when our vessel is broken
[37:29] completely
[37:31] that when he picks up the pieces and he
[37:33] tells you who you are in him
[37:36] that you would understand it and that
[37:39] you would say Lord
[37:40] not your will not my will but yours be
[37:43] done and I just want to sing this song
[37:45] this morning it just really blesses you
[37:54] [Music]

[47:36] um
[47:37] I have two prayer requests that are very
[47:40] deeply upon my heart right now
[47:42] one is brother Johan
[47:44] he's he's getting ready to cross over
[47:48] and he's on the last stages he is body
[47:51] functions sister Teresa says are
[47:54] shutting down he's no longer eating and
[47:58] and drinking
[48:00] and so we just pray for brother Johan
[48:04] and uh
[48:06] I prayed with sister Teresa over the
[48:09] phone last night and her and I agreed
[48:11] and we released his Spirit to God
[48:15] and said God
[48:18] honor thy servant to God if
[48:22] you would be so kind as to just let him
[48:25] gently pass away
[48:27] amen and go to his reward amen healing
[48:31] death actually brings the greatest
[48:33] healing of our mortal bodies
[48:36] amen and we pass from
[48:39] this mortality to immortality
[48:43] so we pray for them she needs our prayer
[48:46] at this time it's a very sad time and a
[48:50] lonely time if I could say that for
[48:53] sister Teresa so also a little Josiah
[48:57] this little man has just gone through
[49:01] hardship and trial since his birth
[49:05] and uh he's battling right now he's
[49:09] struggling the doctors don't know what
[49:11] it is and they run their tests and they
[49:14] practice medicine as they do we thank
[49:17] God for that but I'm just asking God be
[49:21] merciful to this little baby and may God
[49:25] raise him up show grace and mercy once
[49:29] again and be a an encouragement too
[49:33] to Ben and Megan and stuff because you
[49:38] know they as parents carry a burden
[49:42] um and 24 7.

[49:49] with me right now for a moment as I pray
[49:51] for both of these

[50:00] his Zeal for the word
[50:03] his Joy of serving you and how he
[50:08] enjoyed talking about the message and
[50:10] the things of God
[50:12] and now
[50:14] he's at his life's end of his journey I
[50:19] pray o God that you will comfort him and
[50:21] what you send angels of Mercy to come
[50:24] down be at his bedside
[50:27] to help him as he crosses over father
[50:30] sister Teresa a faithful servant I pray
[50:34] that you will bless her to comfort her
[50:37] heart Lord give her a peace that passes
[50:40] all understanding

[50:48] have been so faithful

[50:52] smile and a joy on their face they have
[50:55] gone through every trial
[50:57] the father eventually one's Spirit gets
[51:02] word down you get discouraged trial
[51:05] after trial but Lord we know that
[51:08] through it all

[52:20] just only here for a day or so wants to
[52:22] go see Sabino Canyon and those things
[52:26] and so we greet him in the name of the
[52:29] Lord
[52:33] so our brother Sam cabango
[52:36] God bless you my brother
[52:38] do view beneath
[52:41] God bless you
[52:46] okay
[52:48] may the Lord bless you richly
[52:54] I didn't hear your feedback you don't
[52:56] want the blessings
[53:00] you don't want the blessings
[53:05] I say may the Lord bless you richly
[53:12] I'm happy to be among you
[53:15] um
[53:21] like the bible say that is good for
[53:24] Braden to dwell together because that's
[53:26] where God sent his Blessing
[53:30] that's a reason that bring me here this
[53:32] morning
[53:38] my name is Sam Adair I'm your brother
[53:45] I'm coming from the Republic of Congo
[53:57] [Music]
[54:02] at the border of Congo and Zambia
[54:10] that way the Lord has given us the
[54:13] burden of a little church with which we
[54:16] save the Lord
[54:25] to visit the U.S particularly easy
[54:29] particularly here
[54:33] because I was in Houston
[54:39] I wanted to see where they took the
[54:41] picture of the Angel of the Lord
[54:44] and I came here or visited
[54:49] and to visit other places and mountains
[54:56] from which Our God God Prophet went and
[55:00] to give us a revelation of the message
[55:02] of the hour
[55:04] I'd say thank you to the Reverend pastor
[55:09] for the work that he is doing over here
[55:14] and also and I thank you
[55:18] for the good purpose
[55:21] and for this morning
[55:25] the only good word I can tell you is
[55:29] that the Lord Jesus blessed you richly
[55:32] [Applause]
[55:41] thank you
[55:49] I told him I said the next time that he
[55:51] comes I take an extra day and preach for
[55:54] us you know I I'd like to meet these men
[55:57] first and greet them and just kind of
[56:00] see their spirit and everything and it's
[56:03] always good to meet the Saints from
[56:04] other countries
[56:06] and all of that and I I've got an awful
[56:10] lot that I feel on my heart this morning
[56:13] and I pray that what God will do
[56:17] is he will unburden me from the things
[56:21] that I see that is going on right now
[56:24] and the Lord help me to be able to
[56:27] transfer this thought because God gives
[56:29] a thought it's usually a simple thought
[56:32] and he just gives it to you and and then
[56:35] the more that you look into it you find
[56:37] out that God is revealed in Simplicity
[56:41] let's stand together let's sing that
[56:45] song only
[56:47] believe
[56:48] brother Brown said that's our theme song
[56:56] [Music]
[57:17] oh
[57:22] [Music]
[57:25] [Applause]
[57:25] [Music]
[57:36] foreign
[57:38] [Music]
[57:43] Lord you have given us your word
[57:47] you've given us the Holy Spirit
[57:50] which will lead and guide us into all
[57:54] truth
[57:55] you've sent to us a message in this end
[57:58] Time Lord
[58:00] that we might know how to worship you
[58:03] in spirit and in truth father God now I
[58:07] pray that you will come and bless your
[58:10] word illuminate it to our understanding
[58:13] father
[58:15] because if you remain an unknown God we
[58:18] will not know how to worship you
[58:22] but if you make yourself known and
[58:24] reveal yourself to us
[58:27] and make your word clear to our
[58:29] understanding father then we shall know
[58:33] even as we are known
[58:36] father I thank you I ask that you come
[58:39] and bless the reading of Thy Word
[58:42] and blessed to the hearts of thy people
[58:44] in Jesus Christ's name
[58:47] [Music]
[58:50] thank you thank you musicians God bless
[58:53] you Justin thank you thank you for that
[58:56] song that was inspired
[59:04] many times God births
[59:07] something out of your trial
[59:11] out of your calamity
[59:13] out of an issue out of something
[59:16] that happens in your life and you wonder
[59:18] why
[59:20] and then God shows you later that there
[59:23] was a purpose behind everything amen
[59:26] yesterday had a small video clip sent to
[59:29] me by
[59:30] brother Brian and Sarah they sent me a
[59:33] little clip of brother Neil
[59:35] he got his legs as prosthetic legs and
[59:38] yesterday
[59:39] he took his first several steps there
[59:42] and uh you know he it was just a few
[59:46] steps at first and he just kind of
[59:48] mechanically going there and he got
[59:50] there and and everything he said that
[59:53] was good
[59:55] amen God bless you our brother Neil may
[59:58] the Lord richly bless you as our
[1:00:02] one step at a time brother
[1:00:05] amen Matthew chapter 15.
[1:00:09] then we'll go to mark 7.
[1:00:13] then we'll go to the Book of Revelation
[1:00:15] Matthew chapter 15 verses 7 through 9.
[1:00:27] Matthew 15 verse 7. are you there
[1:00:30] amen ye Hypocrites well did isaiahs the
[1:00:34] prophesy of you saying
[1:00:37] this people draweth nigh unto me with
[1:00:40] their mouth
[1:00:42] and honoreth me with their lips
[1:00:45] but their heart is far from me
[1:00:49] but in vain do they worship me teaching
[1:00:53] for Doctrine
[1:00:55] the Commandments of men
[1:00:59] turn with me to Mark chapter 7.
[1:01:03] Mark chapter 7 verses 6 through 9.
[1:01:12] you know they
[1:01:14] Tom and we're testing Jesus because they
[1:01:18] saw his disciples came to eat and they
[1:01:19] didn't wash their hands for the Heat and
[1:01:21] they oh they were offended
[1:01:24] because they had been had all these
[1:01:27] rituals of Washings and different things
[1:01:30] that they were to do and here now the
[1:01:32] disciples come and with unwashed hands
[1:01:34] they go ahead and eat they bless the
[1:01:36] food and eat it
[1:01:38] and so we come into this portion of
[1:01:41] scripture Mark 7 verse 6.
[1:01:45] and he answered and said unto them well
[1:01:48] hath Isaiah's prophesied of you
[1:01:51] hypocrites
[1:01:52] as it is written
[1:01:54] this people honoreth me with their lips
[1:01:58] but their heart
[1:01:59] is far from me
[1:02:02] I'll be in vain they do they worship me
[1:02:05] teaching for doctrines
[1:02:08] the Commandments of men
[1:02:10] for laying aside the Commandment of God
[1:02:13] you hold the tradition of men
[1:02:15] as the washing of pots and of Cups and
[1:02:19] of many others such like things do ye
[1:02:23] or ye do
[1:02:25] and he said unto them
[1:02:28] full well you reject the Commandment of
[1:02:31] God
[1:02:32] that you may keep your own tradition
[1:02:36] wow
[1:02:39] he said they honoreth me their mouth
[1:02:42] their lips but their heart is far from
[1:02:46] me
[1:02:47] and he says in vain
[1:02:50] do they worship
[1:02:52] turn with me the Book of Revelation
[1:02:53] we'll go to Revelations 19 then we'll go
[1:02:56] to revelation 22.
[1:02:59] Book of Revelation chapter 19.
[1:03:06] verses 9 through 10.
[1:03:11] and he saith unto me right blessed are
[1:03:14] they which are called unto the married
[1:03:16] supper of the Lamb
[1:03:18] and he saith unto me these are the true
[1:03:21] sayings of God
[1:03:22] and I felt that his feet to worship Him
[1:03:26] and he said unto me see thou do it not I
[1:03:29] am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:03:32] Brethren that have the testimony of
[1:03:35] Jesus
[1:03:37] worship God
[1:03:39] for the testimony of Jesus Christ is the
[1:03:44] spirit of Prophecy
[1:03:46] notice he said don't worship me
[1:03:49] I'm just a man don't worship Angels you
[1:03:52] worship God Amen
[1:03:56] amen revelation 22
[1:04:00] verses 7 through 10.
[1:04:05] behold I come quickly blessed is he that
[1:04:07] keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of
[1:04:10] this book
[1:04:12] and I saw and I John saw these sayings
[1:04:15] and heard them
[1:04:17] and when I had heard and seen I fell
[1:04:19] down to worship before the feet of the
[1:04:21] Angel which showed me these things
[1:04:25] and he seeth unto me see thou do it not
[1:04:27] for I am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:04:30] Brethren the prophets
[1:04:32] of them which keep the sayings of this
[1:04:35] book
[1:04:37] notice again
[1:04:39] worship God
[1:04:44] and he seeth unto me seal not the
[1:04:47] sayings of the prophecy of this book
[1:04:49] for the time is at hand may God bless
[1:04:52] the reading of his word you may be
[1:04:54] seated
[1:04:56] amen we see other times when seal up
[1:04:59] John those things which you have heard
[1:05:02] we see others forbidden to write but
[1:05:04] here at the end of the book guess what
[1:05:06] God is doing
[1:05:08] he says seal not those things
[1:05:11] so we see there's an unsealing
[1:05:14] of the word of God there's an opening of
[1:05:17] the word of God that was not given in
[1:05:20] other ages but is given now in this age
[1:05:23] so we thank God for what he has done in
[1:05:26] this hour
[1:05:27] by sending a prophet Messenger to come
[1:05:30] and to share with us those Mysteries
[1:05:35] because
[1:05:36] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:05:40] without the revealing of Christ you
[1:05:43] don't understand the Bible
[1:05:45] you don't understand whether he's one
[1:05:48] God three Gods whether you baptize
[1:05:50] father son holy ghost or Lord Jesus
[1:05:52] Christ
[1:05:53] now I've been pondering over this
[1:05:56] thought for some weeks now
[1:05:59] and I wish to title my sermon this
[1:06:01] morning worshiping God
[1:06:06] because every one of us are interested
[1:06:08] in this
[1:06:10] every one of us are told by the
[1:06:12] scriptures to worship God to praise His
[1:06:15] holy name
[1:06:17] to exalt the god of heaven and all so
[1:06:21] each one of us
[1:06:24] are to be included not excluded but to
[1:06:27] be included in Holy Ghost worship
[1:06:31] amen so what is Holy Ghost worship how
[1:06:35] do we actually worship God and I wish to
[1:06:39] look at this in all angles
[1:06:42] so that we might have a greater
[1:06:44] understanding because I believe that you
[1:06:47] can worship God and it be vain worship
[1:06:51] you can light candles you can say
[1:06:53] prayers you can be ever so sincere and
[1:06:56] wouldn't it be horrible after you've
[1:06:58] done all those things you've been a good
[1:07:01] church member you you've done for years
[1:07:03] and years and years and you were so
[1:07:06] sincere and at the end God said it was
[1:07:08] in vain
[1:07:10] Compass Florida
[1:07:12] so I want to talk about worshiping God
[1:07:15] and I want to take true worship versus
[1:07:18] vain worship
[1:07:21] so Worship in Hebrew and in fact the the
[1:07:24] word worship is all through the Old and
[1:07:28] New Testament
[1:07:30] we are told
[1:07:32] by the prophets of old hell that we must
[1:07:35] worship God
[1:07:36] there are so many scriptures and I just
[1:07:39] became uh elated I I became joyful
[1:07:43] looking at all of the scriptures
[1:07:45] containing to how we must worship God
[1:07:50] and there's one thing that I do love to
[1:07:53] do and that is to worship Him
[1:07:56] but what kind of worship does God accept
[1:07:59] because there's all kinds of worship
[1:08:03] and we want to know the right kind that
[1:08:05] we might be accepted of God
[1:08:08] amen Worship in Hebrews
[1:08:12] Shaka
[1:08:14] it means to bow down to fall down
[1:08:17] to humbly beseech God in obeisance
[1:08:21] to do reverence
[1:08:23] and to worship it means to come before
[1:08:26] God with reverence and godly respect
[1:08:32] it's not just coming and before God's
[1:08:37] Great Majesty because he is God he's
[1:08:40] King
[1:08:41] and when you approach a king
[1:08:43] you've got to do it in a reverent manner
[1:08:47] over in Great Britain
[1:08:51] um
[1:08:52] if people are going to approach
[1:08:56] the king of England
[1:08:59] they have to do it correctly
[1:09:02] they have to come you just don't walk in
[1:09:05] and and do your thing I was told when
[1:09:08] Babe Ruth went to visit
[1:09:11] um the king of England
[1:09:14] that he went over there and he had been
[1:09:17] taught all little protocol this is what
[1:09:19] you do
[1:09:20] but him being who he was in an American
[1:09:24] who's going to do his thing
[1:09:28] before he could get introduced to the
[1:09:32] king he just walked into the room
[1:09:34] nonchalantly raises in hiking
[1:09:38] no reverence no protocol
[1:09:42] can you just imagine that's what
[1:09:45] Americans do we just don't really have
[1:09:48] the respect you know
[1:09:50] and the reverence and I wonder if it
[1:09:52] doesn't cross over into our servitude
[1:09:54] towards God Amen hi God
[1:09:58] hey buddy old pal
[1:10:00] when I I want you to under understand
[1:10:04] that the reverence and respect to God
[1:10:08] when I began to look up the glory of God
[1:10:11] and how we come into His presence
[1:10:14] it it comes from the Hebrew word
[1:10:17] gravitas
[1:10:18] which means heavy
[1:10:23] now brother Brahm said God doesn't count
[1:10:25] his men
[1:10:27] he weighs them
[1:10:28] now we're not talking about physical
[1:10:30] weight
[1:10:32] okay
[1:10:35] um so neither when we look at God and we
[1:10:39] talk about his glory
[1:10:41] and it says that he's
[1:10:44] he has a weightiness about him
[1:10:49] gravitas
[1:10:51] it's something that if I could say this
[1:10:54] and I for the lack of a better term so
[1:10:58] that you might understand when we came
[1:11:00] to this message
[1:11:02] we would hear
[1:11:04] sermon after sermon and each time wow
[1:11:07] something new
[1:11:09] would come up you know what we would say
[1:11:11] wow
[1:11:13] wow that's heavy
[1:11:16] you understand wow
[1:11:18] and the more that I know of God
[1:11:22] the more
[1:11:24] he becomes heavy
[1:11:27] it is not just with nonchalance and well
[1:11:30] God had just come in and uh you know you
[1:11:33] just accept anything in any old form of
[1:11:36] worship and not just do what I want to
[1:11:38] do
[1:11:41] will God help us
[1:11:43] to give him the reverence
[1:11:47] and the fear and respect the Bible says
[1:11:50] to fear God with a Godly reverence and
[1:11:53] fear for our God is a consuming fire
[1:11:56] amen
[1:12:01] the Greek word worship
[1:12:05] prosconio
[1:12:06] it means to bow in reverence
[1:12:09] to do homage to have reverence and to
[1:12:12] adore
[1:12:14] and so all through the scripture this
[1:12:18] you know Word Worship is used it's found
[1:12:22] in almost every chapter
[1:12:24] every book The Word Worship
[1:12:30] now
[1:12:32] let me just fill in with a little bit
[1:12:34] brother Branham said that Lucifer was
[1:12:37] God's right hand man
[1:12:39] he was there in the beginning
[1:12:44] he was one of the ones right there did
[1:12:46] you know that he was the leader of
[1:12:49] worship in heaven
[1:12:52] he was also
[1:12:55] instrumental through his lineage you
[1:12:58] follow it Nimrod musical instruments
[1:13:02] so he knew how to worship
[1:13:06] but all of that was okay until iniquity
[1:13:10] was found in him
[1:13:14] he used to lead the Angelic choirs
[1:13:18] so he knows how to worship God
[1:13:23] and did you know that the first battle
[1:13:25] that started in heaven was over the
[1:13:28] subject of worship
[1:13:30] amen
[1:13:33] you remember in Isaiah 14 it says how
[1:13:37] Thou Art fallen from Heaven o Lucifer
[1:13:40] son of the morning how Thou Art cut down
[1:13:42] to the ground and thou didst weaken the
[1:13:45] Nations
[1:13:46] Thor thou is said in thy heart now watch
[1:13:49] Pride
[1:13:51] I will Ascend into heaven
[1:13:54] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:13:57] of God I will sit also upon the Mount of
[1:14:00] the congregation in the sides and I will
[1:14:03] Ascend above the heights of the clouds
[1:14:06] I will be like the most high
[1:14:10] do you understand that was his desire he
[1:14:14] wanted to be worshiped
[1:14:16] so here at the very beginning what
[1:14:18] started the whole battle in heaven
[1:14:22] was about worship
[1:14:25] who do you worship and how do you
[1:14:28] worship
[1:14:33] Satan was cast down to the Earth
[1:14:36] and his influence is found in worldly
[1:14:40] affairs
[1:14:44] his titles reflect from the scripture
[1:14:47] and calls him the ruler of this world
[1:14:51] the God of this age
[1:14:54] and the prince and power of the air
[1:14:57] the Bible declares that the whole world
[1:15:00] lies under the sway of the wicked one
[1:15:05] now our Prophet clearly told us many
[1:15:08] times
[1:15:09] he said that every nation every
[1:15:13] government in the world is controlled by
[1:15:17] Satan
[1:15:18] are we aware of that
[1:15:21] so we're not looking to anything here in
[1:15:24] America America started out remember
[1:15:27] she's found in the Book of Revelation
[1:15:30] chapter 13 she starts as a lamb
[1:15:36] but says that time will come when she
[1:15:38] will speak like a dragon
[1:15:42] understand America is falling at a very
[1:15:46] rapid rate
[1:15:49] it is setting up the precedent
[1:15:52] for the Dragon
[1:15:54] to make war
[1:15:57] it's a spiritual warfare it's going on
[1:16:00] so now he wants to have the people of
[1:16:04] the world
[1:16:05] to worship Him
[1:16:12] so the whole world system
[1:16:15] the prophet told us is Satan's Eden
[1:16:19] he's created a system for this world
[1:16:22] for the people to become deceived and to
[1:16:24] worship
[1:16:26] the creation and not the Creator
[1:16:30] he's always
[1:16:32] desired to take away the true worship of
[1:16:34] God and have the people to worship Him
[1:16:38] the Bible says that Satan is a mighty
[1:16:40] power
[1:16:43] but God Is An Almighty power
[1:16:48] you and I when we depend upon our own
[1:16:50] strength and our own
[1:16:52] uh abilities are no match for Satan
[1:16:57] the fact that Jesus said Satan
[1:17:01] he was speaking to Peter Satan's desire
[1:17:04] to sift you like he would wheat
[1:17:07] how many of you have ever felt the
[1:17:10] sifting of Satan in your life taking
[1:17:13] this and that and and and things and
[1:17:16] problems and uh uh all of these uh
[1:17:20] things in our lives complexes
[1:17:24] and had it not been for God praying for
[1:17:27] us guess what we would have been sifted
[1:17:29] but because God is watching over that he
[1:17:33] lets seed in you Satan is a gene enemy
[1:17:37] he can only go so far
[1:17:41] you're no match for the devil outside of
[1:17:44] Christ
[1:17:45] but in Christ I can do all things
[1:17:49] Satan is to be under my foot
[1:17:52] amen he has no control over me he can he
[1:17:57] can torment me
[1:17:59] he can give me trials but I will
[1:18:02] overcome every one of them because I've
[1:18:05] been made more than a conqueror through
[1:18:08] Christ
[1:18:10] amen I can do all things through Christ
[1:18:13] which strengthens me
[1:18:16] amen
[1:18:18] I want to see what the prophet said
[1:18:20] about worshiping God
[1:18:22] in the Ephesian Church age and this was
[1:18:25] an astounding quote when I read it it
[1:18:28] just seemed to open in many directions
[1:18:32] Ephesians Church age
[1:18:34] page 69 paragraph two
[1:18:37] now let us be very careful
[1:18:40] that we are not confused at this point
[1:18:44] thus we will seek the word to validate
[1:18:46] this claim let us go back to the book of
[1:18:50] the beginning Genesis
[1:18:52] in the Garden of Eden there were two
[1:18:55] trees
[1:18:56] one was good one was evil
[1:18:59] one was a produced life the other
[1:19:02] produced death
[1:19:04] there were two children who originally
[1:19:06] offered sacrifices to God
[1:19:10] let me repeat that that both
[1:19:14] offered sacrifices to God
[1:19:17] and then he quotes Genesis 4 verses 3
[1:19:21] for 5.
[1:19:24] it says in the process of time it came
[1:19:26] to pass that Cain brought of the fruit
[1:19:28] of the ground and offering unto the Lord
[1:19:31] now I want you to understand God had
[1:19:34] already cursed the ground
[1:19:37] Adam because thou has done this God
[1:19:39] didn't curse out of me curse the ground
[1:19:43] amen okay
[1:19:44] so the ground has been cursed so now
[1:19:46] Cain is taking up something cursed
[1:19:53] and Abe also brought of the first things
[1:19:55] of his flock oh he's a shepherd
[1:19:58] and of the father of the Lord had
[1:20:00] respect unto Abel and his offering but
[1:20:04] unto Cain and his offering he had no
[1:20:06] respect
[1:20:09] but one cane was evil being the father
[1:20:12] being of his father that Wicked one
[1:20:15] while Abel was righteous before the Lord
[1:20:19] again there were two children from the
[1:20:21] Flesh of the same parents
[1:20:24] they were the twins
[1:20:26] of Isaac and Rebecca
[1:20:29] one was the elect of God and the other
[1:20:31] was a reprobate
[1:20:33] both worshiped God
[1:20:35] in every single case
[1:20:38] there was worship of God involved
[1:20:41] I want you to see in every case
[1:20:45] there was worship of God involved are we
[1:20:48] together on that
[1:20:50] this is where it just opened up
[1:20:53] both
[1:20:54] in every case the evil hated the
[1:20:57] righteous and persecuted the righteous
[1:21:00] in some cases the evil destroyed the
[1:21:03] righteous but notice they were planting
[1:21:06] together they lived together they both
[1:21:08] made claims upon God and worshiped God
[1:21:14] brother Brenham
[1:21:16] says in every case
[1:21:19] it involves worship
[1:21:22] wow
[1:21:23] so mystery Babylon now is being exposed
[1:21:27] by the
[1:21:29] Spirit of this hour the spirit of Christ
[1:21:32] revealing his word and we understand
[1:21:35] about mystery Babylon the great the
[1:21:37] mother of harlots
[1:21:39] where does denominations Spirit of
[1:21:42] organized religion where does it come
[1:21:44] from
[1:21:45] he said mystery Babylon the Great
[1:21:49] Jezebel religion
[1:21:51] always centers around listen satanic
[1:21:56] worship
[1:21:58] let me show you what brother Branham
[1:21:59] said
[1:22:00] pergamian Church age pergamus was not
[1:22:03] originally the place where Satan as
[1:22:06] concerning human affairs dwelt
[1:22:08] Babylon has always been literally in
[1:22:12] figuratively his headquarters
[1:22:15] it was in the city of Babylon the
[1:22:18] satanic worship
[1:22:20] had its origin
[1:22:21] whoa
[1:22:25] satanic worship
[1:22:27] you see everything that started in
[1:22:30] heaven has come down and was cast down
[1:22:32] to a human battle it's all about worship
[1:22:40] do you know the Bible says
[1:22:43] that the Antichrist system
[1:22:46] will finally head itself up into the
[1:22:48] image of the Beast how many of you know
[1:22:50] that
[1:22:52] his final stage will cause him to be
[1:22:55] worshiped by all those whose names were
[1:22:58] not written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:23:00] Revelation 13 verses 6 through 9 and he
[1:23:03] opened his mouth and blasphemy against
[1:23:06] God
[1:23:08] to blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle
[1:23:11] and them that dwell in heaven
[1:23:14] and it was given unto him to make war
[1:23:16] with the Saints and to overcome them and
[1:23:19] power was given over all kindred's
[1:23:22] tongues and Nations
[1:23:24] and all that dwell on the Earth shall
[1:23:27] worship Him notice it's all about
[1:23:30] worship
[1:23:33] amen and who is it that these all are
[1:23:36] going to worship Him
[1:23:38] whose names are not written in the Book
[1:23:41] of Life of the lamb slain from the
[1:23:44] foundation of the world if any man have
[1:23:48] an ear let him hear
[1:23:50] amen America Revelation 13 what was it
[1:23:55] started as a lamb she's going to speak
[1:23:57] as a dragon
[1:23:59] and you see the laws coming on that are
[1:24:02] enacted now by the left wing out of
[1:24:05] their mind people
[1:24:08] that have gone totally insane
[1:24:11] that let me tell you they're doing
[1:24:13] everything they can
[1:24:15] to take away anything about the true
[1:24:18] worship of God why they're taking away
[1:24:21] your laws your rights
[1:24:25] you can't have a gas stove imagine
[1:24:29] you can't drive a gas car you can't have
[1:24:32] a ceiling fan
[1:24:33] they're they're wanting to control
[1:24:35] everything about you well let me tell
[1:24:38] you that reminds me of the story of the
[1:24:40] little Eagle in the nest
[1:24:43] all of the little fluffy things are
[1:24:45] being taken out all your little comfort
[1:24:47] of ladies see you and I trusted in
[1:24:50] riches in my house and my car God's
[1:24:52] taken this out that out that uh
[1:24:55] it's getting awfully uncomfortable out
[1:24:58] here why because the nest is fixing to
[1:25:01] get emptied
[1:25:02] somebody say Amen I'm about ready to get
[1:25:05] out of here I find no more comfort in
[1:25:08] this world
[1:25:11] Hallelujah
[1:25:13] so
[1:25:16] Fellowship by Redemption brother Branham
[1:25:19] says and today we still use it
[1:25:22] self-sufficiency
[1:25:25] we use all the different ideas and vain
[1:25:28] philosophies of men it's absolutely of
[1:25:30] not
[1:25:31] Jesus said men worship me teaching for
[1:25:34] Doctrine the traditions of men
[1:25:37] Worship in vain you could Worship the
[1:25:40] Lord and still not worship in the right
[1:25:43] way
[1:25:45] it would not be reckoned to you for
[1:25:48] reconciliation
[1:25:49] now let me tell you brother Branham
[1:25:51] begins to preach this in denominational
[1:25:54] thinking people who put all of their
[1:25:58] their their
[1:25:59] understanding about God and worshiping
[1:26:03] God under a denominational viewpoint
[1:26:07] and he comes along and he says you know
[1:26:10] what you could Worship the Lord and it's
[1:26:12] still not be received by God
[1:26:16] now Tabernacle I want you to think on
[1:26:18] this so he's now speaking to his church
[1:26:21] let not it pass by and say brother Bill
[1:26:24] come in and said so and so
[1:26:27] take it in your heart
[1:26:29] ponder over and why do we have our ups
[1:26:32] and downs
[1:26:33] why does things go the way they're going
[1:26:36] is because first we got to get back to
[1:26:40] the foundation
[1:26:42] Hallelujah he makes the word of God as
[1:26:45] our absolute he said that is the rock of
[1:26:48] Revelation the church is founded upon
[1:26:52] not upon ideas not upon opinions
[1:26:55] but upon the saith the Lord
[1:27:00] so the prophet is having issues rise
[1:27:03] even within his own church
[1:27:06] many of them had come out from quote
[1:27:09] Pentecost or denomination Baptist
[1:27:11] Methodist Presbyterian
[1:27:14] all of the different ones
[1:27:16] so he's got to correct them
[1:27:19] so that he can keep them in balance
[1:27:23] now in spiritual adoption let me show
[1:27:26] you what he says
[1:27:28] and it's possible get it now listen
[1:27:32] you can worship through knowledge
[1:27:35] you can go to church by knowledge that
[1:27:38] you should do it
[1:27:40] but going to church that way is
[1:27:42] worshiping
[1:27:44] in vain
[1:27:48] well I went to church for so many years
[1:27:50] I knew you should go to church
[1:27:55] vain no star
[1:27:59] but when there's nothing happens down in
[1:28:02] your heart that makes you love God in
[1:28:04] such a way you can't stay away from the
[1:28:07] church that's the revelation God
[1:28:09] revealing
[1:28:11] that's the reason and you can't wait to
[1:28:13] come to church
[1:28:15] not to see one another
[1:28:17] not to hear some eloquent speaker
[1:28:20] but for you for God to share with you
[1:28:24] spiritual thinking
[1:28:27] for him to share with you his mind
[1:28:31] to give you revelation
[1:28:36] continuing on
[1:28:39] he says in the Hebrews series 57
[1:28:43] we should not Worship the Lord just
[1:28:45] after we get through preaching the word
[1:28:47] as we usually do
[1:28:49] just worship Him
[1:28:51] that's wonderful
[1:28:54] but we should worship him every hour of
[1:28:57] our life
[1:28:59] now here's something that's going to
[1:29:00] Astound you
[1:29:02] when we're at work we should worship Him
[1:29:09] every time the opportunity presents
[1:29:11] itself Worship the Lord by testifying of
[1:29:16] him
[1:29:18] you want to worship God testify
[1:29:22] tell them how your candle got lit if you
[1:29:24] see some of you ladies
[1:29:27] you see a woman in the wrong Worship the
[1:29:29] Lord by taking her and saying sister
[1:29:32] there's a better life than this
[1:29:36] let me just say this I had a a brother
[1:29:39] over in Switzerland
[1:29:42] who
[1:29:43] there was a couple people they started a
[1:29:46] company kind of like an insurance
[1:29:48] company or something
[1:29:51] and
[1:29:53] um so he got hired
[1:29:55] and he got called into the boss's office
[1:29:58] it was a woman
[1:30:00] and he was just kind of telling her some
[1:30:03] things and whatever in his as he left
[1:30:06] the room he said I just wanted to tell
[1:30:08] you God bless you
[1:30:12] he walks out of the room she says hey
[1:30:13] come back here
[1:30:16] what did you mean God bless you I just I
[1:30:19] meant God bless you
[1:30:22] that opened the door now watch this it's
[1:30:24] amazing
[1:30:25] that opened the door for him to testify
[1:30:28] to her
[1:30:30] she comes to Christ receives the message
[1:30:33] her husband
[1:30:35] and guess what everyone in the company
[1:30:40] everyone in the company was this all of
[1:30:42] them got converted and came into the
[1:30:44] message
[1:30:45] then the company fell apart
[1:30:50] there was only one reason it was started
[1:30:53] because a brother testified and said God
[1:30:57] bless you and I will tell you God will
[1:30:59] give you opportunity after opportunity
[1:31:02] if you will open your mouth and say hey
[1:31:04] God bless you may you have a wonderful
[1:31:07] blessed day today you will just blow
[1:31:10] somebody's mind and they'll say there's
[1:31:12] something different about you
[1:31:15] then you have an open door to testify
[1:31:18] watch this when we seize one someone's
[1:31:22] sick
[1:31:25] he says
[1:31:27] and the doctor says there's no more can
[1:31:29] be done we ought to Worship the Lord by
[1:31:31] telling them
[1:31:33] there's a God in heaven that answers
[1:31:35] prayer
[1:31:38] [Music]
[1:31:39] and worship God by testifying
[1:31:44] it's not up to you to heal people it's
[1:31:46] not up to you to change people it's up
[1:31:48] to you to worship God and let them know
[1:31:52] whether they accept him or not guess if
[1:31:55] I and tell them there is a God in heaven
[1:31:59] people will argue about what you believe
[1:32:02] or how you dress or the way that you go
[1:32:04] to church but there's one thing that
[1:32:07] they cannot argue about and that is your
[1:32:09] testimony testify
[1:32:13] that was once lost now I'm saved I once
[1:32:16] was blind now I see glory to God
[1:32:21] that's how I worship God you know what
[1:32:24] makes me different because I know how to
[1:32:26] worship
[1:32:27] [Applause]
[1:32:28] I know where he brought me
[1:32:30] I know where he come from
[1:32:33] Hallelujah
[1:32:37] it's not to be just worshiping God after
[1:32:39] the ministering of the word
[1:32:42] no testify of God wherever you go work
[1:32:46] in the hospital in the grocery store at
[1:32:49] the gas station at school
[1:32:52] amen Harvest Time brother Branham says
[1:32:56] in vainer they worship me
[1:32:59] they actually worship God Cain actually
[1:33:02] worshiped God in the beginning
[1:33:04] but in vain do they worship me what's
[1:33:07] vain it don't do no good they might say
[1:33:11] well I do this I dance in the spirit
[1:33:13] I speak in tongues I prophesy I preach
[1:33:16] the gospel
[1:33:18] but failed to let your hair grow out
[1:33:21] fail on one thing see what happens
[1:33:25] the spirit will leave you right there
[1:33:29] that's what's happened to our churches
[1:33:31] failed
[1:33:34] do you see if we fail to be obedient
[1:33:38] in one commandment we're guilty of all
[1:33:43] brother Brown said it for a woman to
[1:33:45] trim her hair
[1:33:46] he says God doesn't even hear her
[1:33:49] prayers
[1:33:55] in vain worship me oh it's a beautiful
[1:33:58] worship but in vain do they worship me
[1:34:00] teaching for Doctrine the Commandments
[1:34:02] of man
[1:34:03] Prophet noticed what was happening in
[1:34:06] meetings
[1:34:07] so let's see what he said about it
[1:34:09] because remember he was ordained a
[1:34:11] missionary baptist Baptists are kind of
[1:34:14] straight on the word they're kind of
[1:34:16] legal and and and and no emotion
[1:34:21] so brother Branham in the sermon trying
[1:34:23] to do God a service 1965
[1:34:28] he says now look today at the big
[1:34:30] Crusades we've had across the land
[1:34:34] it's proven
[1:34:37] it's been in vain
[1:34:39] whoa
[1:34:42] whoa here's a profit
[1:34:45] these revivals across the land it's been
[1:34:48] in vain
[1:34:50] and Jesus didn't Jesus say here now Luke
[1:34:53] 7 7 in vain do they worship me in vain
[1:34:56] like David bringing the ark up
[1:35:01] how many of you know in second Samuel 6
[1:35:03] it talks about David danced
[1:35:06] why was he dancing
[1:35:08] bringing the ark
[1:35:11] but his dancing stopped when uza got
[1:35:13] killed
[1:35:15] then he was afraid
[1:35:18] take and put in odometer
[1:35:21] right
[1:35:26] in vain did Ahab train them prophets
[1:35:29] invaded Balaam take that money teaching
[1:35:31] for Doctrine the Commandments of man
[1:35:33] it's the Commandment of God that counts
[1:35:36] no matter
[1:35:37] how sin
[1:35:39] then people are really sincere
[1:35:43] you hear that so much they are so
[1:35:45] sincere that don't mean nothing
[1:35:50] Jehovah's Witness
[1:35:52] Seven Day Adventists and all those Cults
[1:35:54] got out here on the street and do things
[1:35:57] that wanna you wouldn't do it one of us
[1:35:59] wouldn't do
[1:36:00] I got Jehovah's Witness that near my
[1:36:03] house they get up at six o'clock in the
[1:36:05] morning
[1:36:06] and at my Park they sit out there and
[1:36:08] put a sign and get all these books and
[1:36:10] they sit there and all dressed up even
[1:36:12] in the Heats of the summer I I go I go
[1:36:15] buy these guys good morning how you
[1:36:17] doing
[1:36:19] when we went to on vacation
[1:36:22] in Turks and Caicos right outside of our
[1:36:25] condo across the street I walk by to go
[1:36:28] to Starbucks six o'clock in the morning
[1:36:31] and in 85 degree morning Heat
[1:36:36] and 90 humidity I'm sweating going 100
[1:36:40] yards and these guys are they're in
[1:36:43] their suits and ties
[1:36:45] because they're sincere
[1:36:49] let me see you do that
[1:36:52] get up and go put a sign put some spoken
[1:36:54] word books out there and then testify to
[1:36:56] god of what God's done in this
[1:36:58] you see I'm saying these people are
[1:37:00] sincere and I think they're a whole lot
[1:37:01] more sincere than we are
[1:37:06] he says Catholic stand on the corner and
[1:37:08] beg and so forth
[1:37:11] like that work billions times billions
[1:37:14] times billions is dollars still beg for
[1:37:16] it
[1:37:17] sincere No Doubt
[1:37:19] churches go and preach and so forth
[1:37:21] ministers stand in the pool but do
[1:37:22] everything they can to get new members
[1:37:24] into the church but it's a new ark
[1:37:27] there's only one Ark to follow that's
[1:37:29] the word of God
[1:37:31] and then contrary to that Ark stay away
[1:37:33] from it it's a new card
[1:37:35] not on the shoulders of God's rights
[1:37:38] stay away from the thing don't have
[1:37:39] nothing to do with it
[1:37:41] you can ever be so sincere and be
[1:37:44] sincerely wrong
[1:37:48] now
[1:37:49] the first time that this Missionary
[1:37:51] Baptist met Pentecostal people
[1:37:55] never been around them before you'll
[1:37:58] remember he went by and he saw and he
[1:38:00] went there and and uh
[1:38:03] I'm not going to go into the story
[1:38:04] because you all know it
[1:38:06] but in the seat of discrepancy watch
[1:38:08] brother Brennan we're going to pick it
[1:38:10] up
[1:38:12] now remember he hears tongues and
[1:38:15] interpretations and oh my and see these
[1:38:18] people jumping and shouting
[1:38:20] and all this he said oh my I'm among
[1:38:23] angels
[1:38:24] he says after that well I thought if I
[1:38:28] could only get where these two main men
[1:38:30] that spoke in tongues and interpreted
[1:38:33] that was burning me up in my heart I
[1:38:36] wanted it so bad
[1:38:38] then he goes on talks about the gift in
[1:38:40] his life I go down to the next
[1:38:42] highlighted if I could ever talk to them
[1:38:45] well in the spirit that was in the
[1:38:48] building felt like it it's really the
[1:38:50] spirit of God so now the spirit that's
[1:38:53] in the building he feels like it's the
[1:38:55] spirit of God
[1:38:56] he says so I got to talk to one of them
[1:39:00] ask him a few questions he was a real
[1:39:02] genuine Christian
[1:39:04] there's no doubt about that that man was
[1:39:06] a real believer the next man when I
[1:39:08] talked to him if I ever met a hypocrite
[1:39:10] that was one of them
[1:39:12] now here's a gift in his hand remember
[1:39:14] now this is second pull
[1:39:18] for actually first pull sign in hand
[1:39:22] second pulled the sermon is Spirit
[1:39:25] now watch
[1:39:28] one's a real believer the other
[1:39:30] hypocrite
[1:39:31] and here's that Spirit one rang out
[1:39:34] according to all I know genuine the
[1:39:37] other one was no good at all and the
[1:39:39] spirit fallen on both of them
[1:39:41] now how can that be
[1:39:45] I did it had me puzzled
[1:39:48] now he he's going away I thought I was
[1:39:51] among Angels now I might be among devils
[1:39:56] okay this is his experience
[1:39:59] so now the next paragraph brother
[1:40:01] Branham said
[1:40:04] two years later
[1:40:06] so now it's two years this has been
[1:40:08] pondering he'd been to this meeting
[1:40:10] all of this excitement and some man two
[1:40:13] years later
[1:40:14] I've been praying in a cave
[1:40:16] where I go to pray how many know that
[1:40:18] Elijah's prayer closets the wilderness
[1:40:24] so he says I'm laying I'm there putting
[1:40:28] my Bible on a on a log
[1:40:30] and he says and and the wind blows it up
[1:40:33] to
[1:40:33] Hebrews 6.
[1:40:36] he reads
[1:40:38] he says but the rain cometh upon the
[1:40:40] Earth often to water it to dress it but
[1:40:42] the thorns and thistles would be
[1:40:44] rejected but the wheat would be gathered
[1:40:46] I thought well just the wind happened to
[1:40:48] blow that open
[1:40:50] I laid the Bible down again and guess
[1:40:52] what here come the wind bloated open
[1:40:55] that happened three times
[1:40:58] I thought well no that's strange
[1:41:03] Hallelujah
[1:41:05] how many of you believe that God does
[1:41:07] strange things
[1:41:09] said Lord why would you open that Bible
[1:41:12] for me to read that when I get down to
[1:41:15] that where thorns and thistles which is
[1:41:17] nine to rejection whose end is to be
[1:41:19] born I thought my why would you open
[1:41:23] that to me there
[1:41:26] next paragraph these real Visions come
[1:41:29] without pulling into any gear that's
[1:41:32] just God so now he's had this vision
[1:41:36] and now there's going to be an
[1:41:38] interpretation so now watch this there
[1:41:41] was a man dressed in white went around
[1:41:42] sowing wheat after he went around the
[1:41:45] curvature of the Earth around come a man
[1:41:47] looked horrible he's dressed in black he
[1:41:50] was throwing weed seeds all over it they
[1:41:54] both come up together
[1:41:57] and when they did they both was thirsty
[1:42:00] because the rain was needed and each one
[1:42:02] looked like was praying with his little
[1:42:04] head bent over lord Send the Rain Send
[1:42:06] the Rain the great clouds come up and
[1:42:09] the rain fell upon the Earth both of
[1:42:11] them
[1:42:12] when it did the little weed jumped up
[1:42:14] began to say praise the Lord praise the
[1:42:16] Lord little wheat jumped up right at the
[1:42:19] same side and said praise the Lord
[1:42:22] praise the Lord
[1:42:23] the vision was interpreted
[1:42:26] rain falls on the just anyone just
[1:42:30] Same Spirit can fall in a meeting and
[1:42:32] everybody rejoicing in Hypocrites and
[1:42:34] Christians and all together
[1:42:39] exactly right
[1:42:41] but what is it by their fruits they are
[1:42:44] known
[1:42:45] that's the only way it can ever be known
[1:42:49] by the fruits
[1:42:51] then you say
[1:42:52] that now since Wild Oats or wild wheat
[1:42:55] and Grains sometimes impersonate a
[1:42:58] genuine domestic grain so close it would
[1:43:02] deceive the very elected I think we're
[1:43:04] living in a timely age
[1:43:06] when these things should be preached on
[1:43:08] and talked about
[1:43:10] how many of you believe that
[1:43:12] amen
[1:43:14] so now
[1:43:17] you know I love to worship God
[1:43:19] I think that when we sing songs and we
[1:43:23] begin to Worship You Feel The anointing
[1:43:25] of God how wonderful it is
[1:43:27] and I remember
[1:43:30] that somebody shared a song that we we
[1:43:33] sang hear it
[1:43:36] our church
[1:43:37] and so I looked up who it was that
[1:43:40] was the author
[1:43:42] and I watched them sing it
[1:43:45] and boy did it give me a shock
[1:43:48] because I see short-haired women with
[1:43:53] all kinds of makeup and earrings
[1:43:56] and yet
[1:43:59] singing a very inspirational song
[1:44:04] okay
[1:44:08] that song I got a fire shut up in my
[1:44:10] bones
[1:44:12] and it's becoming quite popular among
[1:44:15] messaged churches I got a fire shut up
[1:44:19] in my bones I got a fire
[1:44:22] shut up in my bowling goes on and on and
[1:44:24] the people pretty soon everybody just
[1:44:26] jumping and got a fire and if this is
[1:44:28] fire was in you you know and all of this
[1:44:30] stuff and people and man I began to see
[1:44:32] and you know what the people in that
[1:44:35] denomination
[1:44:37] who are not living according to God's
[1:44:39] word are all their worshiping God and do
[1:44:43] not tell me they're not worshiping they
[1:44:46] are
[1:44:47] they got their hands up and they're
[1:44:49] crying and they're kneeling down
[1:44:51] and they're doing all of this kind of
[1:44:53] stuff and it's worship
[1:44:57] I wonder if it's accepted
[1:45:02] do you understand amen
[1:45:05] amen and I I want to see
[1:45:08] a few things here
[1:45:10] let me see here I didn't want to skip
[1:45:11] this
[1:45:20] they're singing with feeling and
[1:45:22] enthusiasm
[1:45:24] huh wow
[1:45:26] well you can find it all over the
[1:45:28] internet
[1:45:30] of the way they're acting
[1:45:32] um
[1:45:33] the what they're preaching
[1:45:35] and what they're doing
[1:45:36] and you can just begin to see and watch
[1:45:40] the way they act
[1:45:42] okay it's not because of the word
[1:45:45] it's because at the end of the service
[1:45:49] what they do is use the channel of music
[1:45:51] to get the people all inspired
[1:45:55] now listen God doesn't need
[1:45:58] the piano or the organ those are
[1:46:00] instruments to help us worship that's
[1:46:03] true David played a harp
[1:46:07] evil spirits left
[1:46:11] and you see the the worship that is
[1:46:14] going on even among denomination
[1:46:17] look at what they're doing
[1:46:22] now if we're not careful
[1:46:24] what we'll do is we'll mimic what
[1:46:27] they're doing because
[1:46:30] they call it worship now saints of God
[1:46:33] sometimes I think we got it
[1:46:36] preconceived in our our minds
[1:46:39] that worship is getting out of control
[1:46:44] is getting in the spirit
[1:46:47] and you lose control of yourself your
[1:46:50] tongue your body
[1:46:52] and you shake and you jump or you do
[1:46:54] things
[1:46:56] and say wow that church was so in the
[1:47:00] spirit
[1:47:02] why
[1:47:04] because they ran they jumped they got
[1:47:06] excited
[1:47:09] and there are people that are leaving
[1:47:12] solid-based word churches
[1:47:15] because they want to go and feel an
[1:47:20] anointing and be able to go ahead and
[1:47:23] because you know what it makes them feel
[1:47:26] good they're not preaching against sin
[1:47:29] they're just saying bless God I tell you
[1:47:32] what if the Holy Spirit was here I'll
[1:47:34] tell you what if nobody else dances I'll
[1:47:37] dance if nobody else will shout I'll
[1:47:39] shout if they'll nobody else yambaja
[1:47:42] and pretty soon you have the
[1:47:46] misconstrued idea that that's what the
[1:47:49] holy ghosts would do on you
[1:47:54] when the spirit of the Lord moves on my
[1:47:58] heart I will dance
[1:48:00] like David dance
[1:48:03] you see what I'm saying
[1:48:06] no let the Spirit come upon you first
[1:48:14] God's
[1:48:16] Spirit coming on you and you dance me
[1:48:18] for him
[1:48:19] it's not a show
[1:48:22] it's holy
[1:48:25] it is
[1:48:27] it's not here because of the music
[1:48:34] nonsense brother brem said you want to
[1:48:36] see if it's a real Revival unplug the
[1:48:38] organ
[1:48:40] foreign
[1:48:50] I'm just saying what he said
[1:48:53] okay
[1:48:54] I want to worship God
[1:48:58] but real worship of God comes from the
[1:49:01] heart
[1:49:02] not with just the mouth not with just
[1:49:05] the lips oh God I worship you I worship
[1:49:09] you oh God and God says in vain you
[1:49:12] worship me why I told you not to cut
[1:49:15] your hair I told you not to wear men's
[1:49:17] clothes I told you and on and on and he
[1:49:20] says you watch when you do that
[1:49:23] not even there
[1:49:27] in there my
[1:49:34] rain is falling on the just and the
[1:49:36] unjust
[1:49:37] is that true yeah the same Holy Ghost
[1:49:40] that's falling on the just is falling on
[1:49:42] the unjust the same rain that falls on
[1:49:45] the bride falls on the foolish virgin
[1:49:48] the same rain that falls on the true
[1:49:51] seed falls on the false sea
[1:49:54] somebody say same rain
[1:49:57] same rain
[1:49:58] same sunshine
[1:50:02] Acts 2 verse 17 and 18.
[1:50:06] and they shall come to pass in the last
[1:50:08] days
[1:50:10] see if God I will pour out my spirit
[1:50:12] upon
[1:50:14] just bright
[1:50:16] just message believers
[1:50:20] all
[1:50:22] flesh
[1:50:25] sign hey yes that is heavy
[1:50:28] I will pour out of my spirit upon All
[1:50:30] Flesh
[1:50:32] sons and daughters with dream dreams and
[1:50:34] prophesy there'll be all kinds of
[1:50:36] movement of God
[1:50:43] now
[1:50:45] a sermon that brother Branham really
[1:50:47] goes into the depth of how to worship
[1:50:50] God
[1:50:51] he preaches the sermon God's only
[1:50:54] provided place of
[1:50:56] worship
[1:50:59] he said there's one place
[1:51:02] there's only one place of worship
[1:51:05] and he says everything outside of that
[1:51:08] is vain worship
[1:51:12] wow it's amazing
[1:51:15] so brother Ren said God's provided place
[1:51:18] of worship
[1:51:20] now remember he hasn't provided place
[1:51:23] one place alone where he will meet the
[1:51:25] believing children
[1:51:27] anywhere else won't work
[1:51:32] remember Jesus said when he was on Earth
[1:51:34] talking to a bunch of people who were
[1:51:36] very religious very fine very cultured
[1:51:39] a very zealous people of God but Jesus
[1:51:42] said to them in vain do you worship me
[1:51:45] teaching for Doctrine the traditions of
[1:51:47] man remember how Pious those people was
[1:51:49] and how zealous of God I believe if we
[1:51:52] were counting the people who were more
[1:51:55] zealous of today or that day they would
[1:51:58] be more zealous than we are
[1:52:01] wow far more
[1:52:03] but Jesus God made flesh Among Us said
[1:52:08] in vain do they worship me now he didn't
[1:52:10] say they didn't worship Him
[1:52:13] he said they were worshiping him in vain
[1:52:16] amen
[1:52:20] so anything in vain as of no avail don't
[1:52:23] do no good
[1:52:24] you should never do it because you're
[1:52:27] just wasting your time
[1:52:28] you're wasting your breath you're
[1:52:30] wasting your efforts
[1:52:32] until we come to know
[1:52:34] what we're doing
[1:52:36] how do you know what you're doing
[1:52:38] revelation
[1:52:39] faith is what made
[1:52:42] the offering of the first worship
[1:52:45] between two people on earth
[1:52:47] Cain and Abel the first two that ever
[1:52:51] worshiped
[1:52:53] let me say this it was started in heaven
[1:52:56] worship
[1:52:57] send down to earth and the first two
[1:52:59] guess what
[1:53:01] Cain hated Abel because of how he
[1:53:08] my hatred
[1:53:10] the first homicide let me say this the
[1:53:14] first fratric side killed his brother
[1:53:18] why
[1:53:20] because he hated that his worship was
[1:53:24] not received
[1:53:27] um
[1:53:34] outside of Holy Ghost revelation
[1:53:37] of spirit and its truth it is vain
[1:53:41] worship
[1:53:43] they only provided place of worship is
[1:53:45] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:53:48] given to you by the Holy Spirit faith is
[1:53:51] revelation
[1:53:53] it's a gift of God
[1:53:55] it's not of Works lest any of you boast
[1:54:01] God's provided a place of worship 65.
[1:54:04] I'll choose the place where the people
[1:54:06] will worship me no other place will I
[1:54:09] meet them
[1:54:10] now it's got to be that place and we
[1:54:12] ought to seek it out find out where it's
[1:54:14] at then go there
[1:54:17] and think we should turn there quickly
[1:54:20] where we find the place living other
[1:54:22] things leaving other things alone
[1:54:26] man's tradition then is in vain
[1:54:29] we should never fool with it
[1:54:31] there needs being somewhere someplace
[1:54:35] that has he has provided a place for us
[1:54:38] that we could come and worship and would
[1:54:40] be received now remember outside of that
[1:54:42] chosen place no matter how sincere you
[1:54:45] are how fundamental you are you still
[1:54:47] are worshiping in vain
[1:54:52] I think I looked up Cain worshiped
[1:54:55] there's like 135 quotes on Cain worship
[1:54:58] God
[1:55:01] don't tell me he didn't worship
[1:55:03] we're talking about worshiping God
[1:55:08] now turn with me if you would to one
[1:55:10] portion of scripture let me try to bring
[1:55:12] this to a
[1:55:13] a close here if I could
[1:55:16] turn with me to Saint John chapter 4.
[1:55:25] verses 13 through 26.
[1:55:28] very familiar portion of scripture
[1:55:31] with Jesus speaking to the woman at the
[1:55:34] well
[1:55:37] Saint John 4 verse 13.
[1:55:40] Jesus
[1:55:42] answered and said unto her whosoever
[1:55:44] drinketh of this water shall thirst
[1:55:47] again
[1:55:49] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[1:55:52] I shall give him shall never thirst but
[1:55:54] the water that I shall give him shall be
[1:55:56] in him a well of water springing up into
[1:56:00] everlasting life
[1:56:02] the woman said unto her him
[1:56:04] sir give me this water
[1:56:06] do you know she couldn't get it until
[1:56:09] she asked
[1:56:14] sir
[1:56:16] give me this water
[1:56:19] brother Branham said she got so much
[1:56:21] water
[1:56:22] she left her water pot
[1:56:24] and ran into the city
[1:56:28] because the real vessel that got filled
[1:56:40] all right
[1:56:42] the woman said sir give me this water
[1:56:44] that I thirst not neither come hither to
[1:56:46] draw Jesus saith unto her go call thy
[1:56:50] husband and come hither
[1:56:52] Roman Anson said I have no husband
[1:56:56] Jesus said unto her
[1:56:58] thou Hast well said I have no husband
[1:57:01] what pool is that
[1:57:03] second point discern the heart
[1:57:07] right second pull amen
[1:57:10] amen so he discerns her heart
[1:57:15] for you've had five husbands
[1:57:18] and the one whom thou has now
[1:57:23] is not thy husband
[1:57:25] in thou saidest thou truly
[1:57:28] so she's had five and the one she's
[1:57:31] living with now is not her husband
[1:57:35] do you have Revelation who the true
[1:57:37] husband was
[1:57:39] number seven
[1:57:41] the one who stood before
[1:57:48] the woman saith in unto him sir
[1:57:53] I perceive thou art a prophet
[1:57:57] yeah that is
[1:58:00] that's exactly it
[1:58:02] I perceive thou art a prophet
[1:58:05] brother Branson who told you
[1:58:07] that I'm a prophet
[1:58:10] he says I don't claim to be no prophet
[1:58:13] he says you say I'm a pro I don't call
[1:58:16] myself a prophet
[1:58:19] amen I don't take that honor to myself
[1:58:22] but when I hear him speak you know what
[1:58:24] I say thou art I promise
[1:58:27] can you say Amen to that
[1:58:33] now what she gets brother REM said she
[1:58:36] gets religious our fathers
[1:58:38] worshiped watch we're talking about
[1:58:40] worshiping God
[1:58:42] our fathers worshiped in this mountain
[1:58:45] and you say that and ye say that in
[1:58:49] Jerusalem is a place where men ought to
[1:58:51] worship it's all about
[1:58:54] worshiping God
[1:58:57] Jesus saith unto her woman believe me
[1:59:01] the hour cometh
[1:59:03] when ye shall neither in this mountain
[1:59:07] nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father
[1:59:11] wow he's changing
[1:59:14] if you'll be spiritual now and watch
[1:59:16] this he's changing the place of worship
[1:59:21] Moses was told he met a burning bush on
[1:59:23] Mount Sinai
[1:59:25] go get the people deliver them and bring
[1:59:28] them back to Mount Sinai at this
[1:59:30] mountain they shall worship God
[1:59:38] then Jerusalem
[1:59:40] Solomon goes and builds a temple on
[1:59:43] Mount Moriah
[1:59:45] and it was there you had to go to
[1:59:47] Jerusalem
[1:59:49] to worship God are we together
[1:59:52] so now it's been traditions of man
[1:59:54] they've gone to these places mountains
[1:59:57] and different things
[1:59:58] because they've heard of what God has
[2:00:00] done
[2:00:02] but he says not at this mountain nor at
[2:00:05] Jerusalem worship you you worship what
[2:00:08] you know not
[2:00:11] we know what we worship
[2:00:14] for salvation is of the Jews
[2:00:17] but the hour cometh and now is I love
[2:00:21] this when the true worshipers
[2:00:24] shall worship the father in spirit and
[2:00:28] in truth for the father seeketh such to
[2:00:30] worship him God is a spirit
[2:00:34] and they that worship Him
[2:00:38] must Worship in spirit and Truth
[2:00:46] I know the Messiah when he comes he's
[2:00:48] gonna he's gonna say these things
[2:00:51] now he's going to blow her mind
[2:00:54] excuse the expression
[2:00:56] I I that speak unto thee
[2:01:00] and he
[2:01:10] God likes to reveal himself
[2:01:14] then he pulls back into that invisible
[2:01:16] Realm
[2:01:18] two on the road to Emmaus
[2:01:21] it doesn't matter he he many times now
[2:01:23] watch this God will do this in your life
[2:01:26] throughout multitudes of times he will
[2:01:28] come to you you're praying about a
[2:01:30] certain thing and he comes in here I am
[2:01:32] oh God
[2:01:35] and all of a sudden he pulls back
[2:01:39] see you remember when I preached on the
[2:01:41] right hand of God
[2:01:43] you remember there are
[2:01:44] I think seven times more scriptures
[2:01:47] about God's right hand
[2:01:50] so if you're a left-handed person you
[2:01:52] feel left out
[2:01:54] because God's right-handed
[2:01:56] well no I'll tell you God is
[2:01:58] ambidextrous
[2:02:00] but the Bible says on his left hand
[2:02:02] where he does work right hand blessings
[2:02:05] everybody loves right and blessing oh my
[2:02:08] everybody when they get it right hand
[2:02:09] blessing in the right hand of Fellowship
[2:02:11] it's an anointing it's power Hallelujah
[2:02:14] but left hand blessing is where he moves
[2:02:16] back into that invisible Realm
[2:02:22] even when I can't see him
[2:02:25] he's working even when I can't feel him
[2:02:27] he's working what a left hand
[2:02:30] let me tell you most of the times in
[2:02:33] your life
[2:02:34] when God is dealing with you it's in an
[2:02:37] unseen realm it's in that invisible
[2:02:41] Union hallelujah it's not these
[2:02:43] right-hand blessings dancing on the
[2:02:46] Mountaintop
[2:02:47] it's in the valley of depression
[2:02:54] wow
[2:03:01] Mount Sinai where Moses met the burning
[2:03:04] bush
[2:03:07] we'll go there let thus save the Lord
[2:03:10] Pharaoh let my people go
[2:03:12] we're only going to go three days
[2:03:14] journey so that we might go worship God
[2:03:20] then they go to Jerusalem
[2:03:22] I've made a place the holy of holies
[2:03:26] not Mariah
[2:03:31] the Holy Temple Solomon bill
[2:03:34] wow
[2:03:36] God's chosen place of worship
[2:03:40] but Watch What Happens
[2:03:43] when anything that God does for you and
[2:03:47] tells you you should do it if you lose
[2:03:50] Godly reverence and respect it just
[2:03:53] becomes vain worship
[2:03:59] huh without the sincerity coming at you
[2:04:02] I just come yeah it's another Sunday
[2:04:05] Little Star I've been there yeah went
[2:04:07] and did I sang a few songs went and it's
[2:04:10] not changing your life
[2:04:13] huh it's vain worship
[2:04:21] how many of you know you can have all
[2:04:23] Spirit no truth
[2:04:26] or you can have all truth and no spirit
[2:04:28] brother Ram said we need a balance
[2:04:31] and I think we hear it evening Light
[2:04:33] Fellowship we need to make sure we stay
[2:04:36] a balance
[2:04:37] amen it's not just all a word
[2:04:41] and it's just not all spirit
[2:04:44] because if we are going to worship God
[2:04:46] true worshipers the father seeks those
[2:04:50] who will worship Him in spirit and in
[2:04:53] truth
[2:04:54] there's a balance
[2:04:57] God's provided we have approach to
[2:05:00] Fellowship 1960. many people have
[2:05:04] spirit with no truth others have truth
[2:05:07] and no spirit it's like the man that's
[2:05:09] got money in the bank but don't know how
[2:05:11] to write a check
[2:05:13] the other one knows how to write a check
[2:05:15] got no money
[2:05:17] which one are you
[2:05:20] if we could just get those two together
[2:05:24] but Israel
[2:05:26] let the worship of God become rituals
[2:05:29] and offerings
[2:05:32] they didn't do it with reverence and
[2:05:35] sincerity and Isaiah picks it up I just
[2:05:38] want to show you this
[2:05:40] Isaiah picks it up in chapter 1 verses
[2:05:42] 11 through 14.
[2:05:44] to what purpose is the multitude of your
[2:05:46] sacrifices unto me saith the Lord
[2:05:50] I am
[2:05:51] full of burnt offerings of rams
[2:05:55] fatten the beat end of the FED beast and
[2:05:58] I Delight not in the blood of bullocks
[2:06:01] or of lambs or if he go wait a second
[2:06:04] God you told us to make the sacrifice
[2:06:07] I'm sick of it
[2:06:10] when you come to appear before me who
[2:06:13] hath required this in your hand to tread
[2:06:16] my courts
[2:06:17] bring no more vain oblations
[2:06:20] incense is an Abomination unto me the
[2:06:24] new moons and sabbaths the callings of
[2:06:26] assemblies I cannot away with it
[2:06:31] it is Iniquity even the solemn meetings
[2:06:34] your new moons and your appointed feasts
[2:06:37] my soul heateth
[2:06:40] they are a troubling to me I am weary to
[2:06:42] Bear them in one place he said they are
[2:06:44] a stench in my nostril
[2:06:47] wow
[2:06:53] oh God
[2:06:56] let us look at our worship
[2:07:01] may be well balanced between spirit and
[2:07:03] Truth
[2:07:08] let me ask that Paramount question again
[2:07:12] does God accept
[2:07:14] all worship
[2:07:19] where do we worship
[2:07:22] and how
[2:07:24] do we worship
[2:07:27] the first time in the Bible the word
[2:07:29] worship is used
[2:07:31] Book of Genesis
[2:07:35] remember in Genesis 22 Abraham is told
[2:07:39] to go sacrifice his son Isaac do you
[2:07:41] know he has waited 25 years for the
[2:07:43] promise to come to pass and now here he
[2:07:45] has his son and God is asking
[2:07:49] Abraham to sacrifice his son
[2:07:53] wow
[2:07:55] let me ask you take the Old Testament
[2:07:57] laws in Deuteronomy Leviticus
[2:08:00] numbers
[2:08:02] Thou shalt not suffer thy Sons and
[2:08:05] Daughters to pass through the fire
[2:08:08] you shall not have them as an offering
[2:08:11] it looks unto Abraham as though God is
[2:08:16] asking him to give human sacrifice of
[2:08:20] his own son it's only a it's only a
[2:08:23] pre-figure
[2:08:27] because God did not allow him
[2:08:32] why be because there was already a lamp
[2:08:38] it was already while he was walking up
[2:08:41] the Bible says that he walked three days
[2:08:44] journey and God showed him where it was
[2:08:47] ended when he got to the place
[2:08:49] he knew I must go and I in the lad will
[2:08:53] come back to you but we've got to go and
[2:08:56] to worship
[2:09:02] oh God
[2:09:04] the first time
[2:09:06] it's Abraham is first thing it's used in
[2:09:10] Scripture
[2:09:12] I and my son have got to go and worship
[2:09:16] wow his heart's being tore out of him
[2:09:19] he's asking me
[2:09:21] I imagine for three days
[2:09:24] oh is that the place is that the place
[2:09:26] oh
[2:09:28] Isaac's walking along with his dad
[2:09:31] how am I
[2:09:33] he knows Abraham knows
[2:09:37] the cost oh
[2:09:39] oh and I get to the spot oh my his heart
[2:09:42] boom boom boom boom boom it's here it's
[2:09:45] here
[2:09:47] oh God I don't understand I don't know
[2:09:49] why
[2:09:51] but I love you
[2:09:53] now here's something very very
[2:09:55] interesting
[2:09:56] God did not stop him
[2:09:59] when he tied him up and placed him on
[2:10:01] the altar
[2:10:05] God did not stop him when he took the
[2:10:07] knife in his hand
[2:10:12] God stopped him
[2:10:14] when he put power to the night
[2:10:18] stay thy hand Abraham
[2:10:24] for now I know you love me
[2:10:28] wait a second wait a second
[2:10:30] God is omniscient
[2:10:33] he knew
[2:10:35] what Abraham would do he knew the hearts
[2:10:38] of Abraham
[2:10:40] Abraham didn't know he would go through
[2:10:43] with it
[2:10:46] Abraham proved to God I love you
[2:10:52] it was then
[2:10:54] God he says you're long your name is no
[2:10:57] longer Abram
[2:10:59] your name is Abraham
[2:11:02] why you're like me
[2:11:04] I'm sharing a part of Elohim
[2:11:07] I'm sharing a part of my name I'm
[2:11:09] sharing a part of my attribute you're
[2:11:12] like me Abraham
[2:11:15] Hallelujah true worship
[2:11:23] to worship just doesn't come in each
[2:11:25] generation
[2:11:27] becomes generation after generation
[2:11:29] songs of worship have been written in
[2:11:32] every age
[2:11:36] why because birth out of the message of
[2:11:40] that hour come the songs of that age
[2:11:45] Justin just saying one of them birthed
[2:11:48] in laodicea
[2:11:55] wow isn't that amazing
[2:11:57] huh
[2:11:59] well I gotta proved I'm one in a million
[2:12:04] I've got a show
[2:12:07] power of the blood
[2:12:10] and I gotta prove I'm not like those
[2:12:13] from Satan's Eden I've got to show that
[2:12:17] I'm a person
[2:12:19] that this world isn't worthy of
[2:12:22] ah
[2:12:25] wow
[2:12:27] songs I love to hear these songs birthed
[2:12:31] from this message
[2:12:33] they mean more to me the others are
[2:12:36] trans
[2:12:38] they cross transgeneration
[2:12:42] songs that were written in the second or
[2:12:44] third Church age
[2:12:46] are the songs by Luther and Wesley
[2:12:49] they're beautiful songs
[2:12:52] do you understand that
[2:12:54] because they were done under worship
[2:12:58] they were given under inspiration
[2:13:02] that song
[2:13:05] Amazing Grace
[2:13:09] wow
[2:13:13] they could sing it in every generation
[2:13:16] Amazing Grace how sweet to sound the
[2:13:19] saved a wretched like me
[2:13:21] okay
[2:13:22] and so these songs of worship
[2:13:28] I want to ask you a question
[2:13:31] what caused Paul to be brought before
[2:13:33] magistrates in his day
[2:13:37] what caused Paul
[2:13:39] to come before
[2:13:41] magistrates and why was he brought
[2:13:44] before councils
[2:13:50] because of the way he worshiped
[2:13:53] Acts chapter 18 says then the Lord spoke
[2:13:57] to Paul in a night by a vision
[2:14:01] be not afraid but speak and hold not thy
[2:14:03] peace
[2:14:05] for I am with thee and no man shall set
[2:14:07] thee to hurt thee for I have much people
[2:14:10] in this city
[2:14:12] and he continued there a year and six
[2:14:14] months teaching the word of God among
[2:14:16] them
[2:14:17] then galio
[2:14:20] was a deputy of Acacia
[2:14:23] and Jews made an Insurrection with one
[2:14:26] Accord against Paul and brought him to
[2:14:28] the Judgment seat took him to court
[2:14:32] saying this fellow persuaded men
[2:14:39] to worship God
[2:14:41] contrary to the law
[2:14:46] Paul
[2:14:48] you hear a tick
[2:14:51] we're bringing you to court why because
[2:14:54] of the way you worship
[2:14:57] it was a problem in the beginning it was
[2:15:00] a problem in Genesis it was a problem in
[2:15:04] Acts it's a problem today
[2:15:10] God don't ever let us divide ourselves
[2:15:13] because we worship different than
[2:15:16] someone else
[2:15:20] we're one
[2:15:23] we not may not be the shoutness or jump
[2:15:26] in us but we still worship God
[2:15:35] amen
[2:15:37] I believe we're all
[2:15:40] experience exactly the same thing again
[2:15:42] today
[2:15:44] that's because of worship
[2:15:46] it's not doctrinal issues right now
[2:15:50] ministers are not fighting about well
[2:15:52] he's preaching false Doctrine no it's
[2:15:54] about well they don't worship like we do
[2:16:01] who cares
[2:16:04] listen I know that sometimes culturally
[2:16:08] you worship different in different
[2:16:11] places
[2:16:12] in different ways
[2:16:15] okay
[2:16:17] hey let me tell you in the Congo in
[2:16:20] their song service they get excited
[2:16:23] they do
[2:16:25] man when they talking about we are
[2:16:27] Marching over to Jerusalem we are and
[2:16:32] the sisters have put their purse on
[2:16:33] their hand we are Marching over down the
[2:16:37] Valley of the and man everybody's
[2:16:40] excited
[2:16:41] we sing in we're it's hard enough to get
[2:16:43] us to clap
[2:16:45] white men Don't Clap against
[2:16:49] or jump they can't even jump very high
[2:16:54] but
[2:16:55] we're all different
[2:16:58] and I don't want to americanize my
[2:17:01] Congolese
[2:17:05] you worship God
[2:17:08] and you hey if you wanna
[2:17:10] you go ahead
[2:17:15] yeah we all worship God differently
[2:17:19] so who's right
[2:17:21] what culture is right
[2:17:23] well I'll tell you what in our weddings
[2:17:25] here in America
[2:17:27] we don't do what you do over there
[2:17:30] well does that mean our culture is right
[2:17:32] and yours is wrong are you kidding me
[2:17:35] it's the culture here in America that at
[2:17:38] a wedding you drink booze you listen to
[2:17:41] rock music you you dance and all of that
[2:17:44] because that's the culture
[2:17:46] of a modern day
[2:17:48] wedding in America
[2:17:54] I remember
[2:17:56] my twin brother's wedding
[2:17:59] they had a band rock and roll band
[2:18:02] he said I dedicate this song to my wife

[2:18:53] 24 let me close let me close I'm not
[2:18:56] closing yet but I'm closing
[2:19:00] acts 24 verses 5 through 14. watch this
[2:19:03] we have found this man a pestilent
[2:19:06] fellow
[2:19:08] a mover of sedition among all the Jews
[2:19:12] throughout the world and a ring leader
[2:19:15] now the sick of the nazarenes
[2:19:18] who also have gone about to profane the
[2:19:22] temple
[2:19:23] oh my
[2:19:25] he's brought into
[2:19:27] the court because
[2:19:30] of worship
[2:19:33] and so these I'm not going to read all
[2:19:36] the scripture go to verse 11.
[2:19:38] because they'll make us understand now
[2:19:40] Paul's speaking for himself
[2:19:42] that there are yet but 12 days since I
[2:19:44] went up to Jerusalem for to worship why
[2:19:47] do you go to Jerusalem I'm going to go
[2:19:49] to worship
[2:19:51] they neither found me in the temple
[2:19:53] disputing with any man
[2:19:55] neither raising up the people neither in
[2:19:59] the synagogues or in the city
[2:20:01] neither can they prove the things
[2:20:03] whereof they now accuse me
[2:20:06] you bunch of liars
[2:20:09] but this I confess unto thee
[2:20:13] that after the way which they call
[2:20:16] heresy
[2:20:18] so worship I
[2:20:24] so worshiped by the god of my fathers
[2:20:27] believing all things which are written
[2:20:30] in the law and in the prophets
[2:20:32] couldn't we see the same thing
[2:20:36] they look at you you're weird you're
[2:20:38] strange you're odd balls
[2:20:41] your Heretics
[2:20:43] you believe some kind of deal a prophet
[2:20:46] Angels God speaking thus saith the Lord
[2:20:49] what the spirit is saying to the church
[2:20:53] I believe all
[2:20:55] the law and the prophets
[2:20:57] why because he said if you'll just get
[2:21:00] the people to believe
[2:21:02] because he said if you're not
[2:21:04] elect seed you can't believe
[2:21:08] but if you are
[2:21:11] he said you can't help but believe me
[2:21:14] you got no choice
[2:21:23] he said
[2:21:24] they call it heresy
[2:21:27] so worship I the god of my fathers you
[2:21:30] see what it was about
[2:21:32] it was Worship in heaven Satan cast down
[2:21:36] to earth
[2:21:37] it's still about worship it became
[2:21:39] worship between Cain and Abel
[2:21:42] and I'm saying to this to the message
[2:21:44] believing Believers around the world
[2:21:47] whether you go to my church or not
[2:21:49] do not let the devil try to divide us
[2:21:53] because we see worship differently
[2:21:56] We Are One
[2:22:03] because a nickel AIDS in spirit is to
[2:22:06] divide and
[2:22:07] conquer
[2:22:09] get you all divided
[2:22:11] well it's got to be this way and it's
[2:22:14] over what worship
[2:22:22] first homicide ever recorded and the
[2:22:25] Bible was over worship
[2:22:30] true worship contains a balance of
[2:22:33] mixture of spirit and Truth
[2:22:36] musicians go ahead and come
[2:22:39] true worship centers around the
[2:22:40] believer's heart
[2:22:42] and their obedience to the word
[2:22:46] not with just the mouth
[2:22:49] not with just the lips
[2:22:52] but with the heart
[2:22:54] because if your heart is far from God
[2:22:58] your worship is vain
[2:23:02] it's not accepted
[2:23:08] you see I want you to understand that
[2:23:10] trying
[2:23:12] to do something to get God's attention
[2:23:15] to appease him for him to see you
[2:23:19] is a heathen characteristic
[2:23:24] that's not how loud you scream
[2:23:28] it's not how high you jump
[2:23:31] or how much you run around how many
[2:23:33] times you speak in tongues
[2:23:35] or prophesy
[2:23:37] you don't have to appease God
[2:23:41] by doing something to get his attention
[2:23:45] First Kings chapter 18 perfect example
[2:23:48] Elijah
[2:23:53] and they took the Bullock which was
[2:23:55] given them and they dressed it
[2:23:57] called on the name of Baal from morning
[2:24:00] even till noon saying oh Bale hear us
[2:24:04] there was no voice nor any that answered
[2:24:07] and they leapt upon the altar which was
[2:24:09] made a little bit of zeal well God ain't
[2:24:12] here in his soul and it came to pass and
[2:24:15] Elijah mocked him
[2:24:17] cry aloud in other words hey me hey
[2:24:21] watch this for he is a God
[2:24:23] either he's talking
[2:24:25] or he's pursuing or he's on a journey
[2:24:29] or per adventuring sleepeth
[2:24:31] must be awakened so cry loud he don't
[2:24:35] hear you
[2:24:38] and they cried aloud
[2:24:40] and they cut themselves you talk about
[2:24:42] sincere after the manner with knives and
[2:24:45] lenses till the blood gushed out upon
[2:24:48] him
[2:24:52] John dobsky you've been over there in
[2:24:53] the Philippines
[2:24:55] you've seen those guys take those razor
[2:24:57] blades and whip their backs until their
[2:25:00] backs are bloodied
[2:25:03] sincere you've seen it John
[2:25:10] what they were doing is trying to get
[2:25:13] God's attention
[2:25:14] [Music]
[2:25:16] when it came to pass when midday was
[2:25:18] passed and they prophesied
[2:25:21] okay look at this
[2:25:25] until the time of the offering of the
[2:25:27] evening sacrifice
[2:25:28] that there was neither voiced
[2:25:31] nor any to answer
[2:25:33] or any that regard it
[2:25:37] like I told you there's over 125 quotes
[2:25:40] of Cain worshiped God
[2:25:44] let me show you just a couple just so we
[2:25:47] kind of
[2:25:49] show you what brother Brown said
[2:25:52] show us the father its suffices of
[2:25:54] Cleveland Ohio
[2:25:57] 1950 look Cain and Abel both of them
[2:25:59] wanted to worship God and Cain he built
[2:26:01] her an altar to God
[2:26:04] now if an altar is all that God requires
[2:26:06] Cain was justified
[2:26:09] Cain made a sacrifice upon the altar is
[2:26:11] that right
[2:26:12] well if a sacrifice and an altar is all
[2:26:15] God wants Cain was justified
[2:26:19] then Cain also built an altar and he
[2:26:23] worse he put a sacrifice on it and knelt
[2:26:25] down and worship God but God was
[2:26:27] displeased
[2:26:30] because he didn't come the right way
[2:26:34] the faith that was once delivered to the
[2:26:37] Saints 1953
[2:26:40] Cain was just as sincere
[2:26:44] I believe as evil was
[2:26:47] he was just as much a Believer as Abel
[2:26:49] was
[2:26:50] fundamentally in worshiping he was just
[2:26:53] as fundamental as Abel was
[2:26:56] both of them both boys realized they
[2:26:58] were lost both boys wanted to find favor
[2:27:01] with God both boys brought a sacrifice
[2:27:03] both boys worshiped
[2:27:06] both boys belonged to church
[2:27:09] if a church sacrifice and worship is all
[2:27:12] that God requires
[2:27:14] and God condemned Cain he is unjust in
[2:27:17] doing so
[2:27:19] correct he'd be unjust
[2:27:21] for if we worship all God requires if
[2:27:24] worship is all that God requires Cain
[2:27:27] worship just the same as Abel did and
[2:27:29] perhaps a more beautiful worship
[2:27:32] than that
[2:27:33] of Abel
[2:27:39] faith is what makes a difference in our
[2:27:42] worship to the Lord
[2:27:44] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[2:27:48] excellent sacrifice
[2:27:50] it's not us trying to
[2:27:54] do something to appease God so he'll
[2:27:56] look at us
[2:27:58] no If His Eye Is on the Sparrow
[2:28:02] I know he watches over me
[2:28:04] I don't have to try to get his attention
[2:28:07] hey God hey God look at me hey
[2:28:13] be still
[2:28:16] no I'm God
[2:28:19] reverence holy respectful
[2:28:27] we are programmed in Our Minds when the
[2:28:29] sermon is over that's when we worship
[2:28:31] God
[2:28:32] brother Branham said no just testify
[2:28:35] that's how you really worship
[2:28:38] I want all of you to start testifying
[2:28:40] more tell somebody thank God praise God
[2:28:45] this is somebody the waitress today
[2:28:47] after she brings your food
[2:28:49] just say hey God bless you may have a
[2:28:52] blessed day today
[2:28:53] oh wow
[2:28:56] you might spark somebody's interest
[2:29:00] like that brother did over there in
[2:29:01] Switzerland just God Bless you that's
[2:29:03] all he said
[2:29:04] it costs about eight or ten people all
[2:29:06] to come into the message guess what then
[2:29:08] the whole
[2:29:10] company fell apart
[2:29:16] just say God bless you impresses
[2:29:24] many Believers because they've been
[2:29:26] programmed with mental manipulation
[2:29:30] understand this preconceived idea well
[2:29:34] if God was here I'll tell you
[2:29:39] thank you
[2:29:41] it's
[2:29:43] mental manipulation
[2:29:48] I'll shout if I have to
[2:29:50] I'll dance if I have to I'll tell you
[2:29:53] what I'm not ashamed well I'm not
[2:29:54] ashamed also
[2:29:56] but it is not my dancing and shouting
[2:30:00] that gets attention with God what is it
[2:30:03] is when my faith reaches up
[2:30:08] all right
[2:30:17] brother
[2:30:19] brother Gene who married

[2:36:02] the road when it's unloaded
[2:36:06] he said but put it under a heavy load
[2:36:10] just creaks and groans
[2:36:13] I'm not worried about
[2:36:16] I love to get excited but I've always
[2:36:21] said say something
[2:36:23] that gets me excited about
[2:36:26] amen
[2:36:34] the last example that I'll give you
[2:36:39] is found in Exodus 32 and Moses goes 40
[2:36:43] days onto the mountain
[2:36:46] he gets the decalogue
[2:36:48] comes 0 and 10 Commandments
[2:36:51] Joshua waited there on the mountain and
[2:36:54] guess what you know what Joshua said oh
[2:36:56] it's the sound of war in the camp is
[2:36:59] that what your Bible says oh it's War
[2:37:01] you know what Moses it's not war
[2:37:05] no I hear singing
[2:37:09] I hear singing
[2:37:12] this is not the voice of them crying
[2:37:15] because they're being overcome but the
[2:37:17] noise of them that sing do I hear
[2:37:21] it came to pass as soon as he came night
[2:37:23] of the camp when he saw the calf and the
[2:37:25] dancing
[2:37:27] do you know this is the first time that
[2:37:29] a mega church Israel is dancing around
[2:37:32] something they believe
[2:37:38] who can get all excited and you can sing
[2:37:40] and you can dance and it might be a
[2:37:42] golden cat
[2:37:43] and God said
[2:37:46] you know he does he takes
[2:37:48] he takes those
