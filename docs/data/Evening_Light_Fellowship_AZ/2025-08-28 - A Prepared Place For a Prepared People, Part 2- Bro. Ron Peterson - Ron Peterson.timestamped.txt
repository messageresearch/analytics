[9:59] Father, as we pray as a congregation,
[10:01] Lord, and bring those needs before you,
[10:03] Father. We just ask for the ministering
[10:05] of the word, Lord, this evening. The

[10:11] changed, Father, to be walking a little
[10:14] bit closer, Lord, with you a little bit
[10:15] higher up the ladder when we leave here
[10:17] this evening. Father, we just pray that
[10:19] you come and speak to our hearts. We
[10:21] pray you anoint the musicians, Lord.

[20:00] [Music]
[20:10] My way was filled with danger.
[20:15] I felt alone.
[20:20] The enmy
[20:23] had singled me
[20:26] out to do me wrong.
[20:30] And when he drew near, my heart filled
[20:34] with fear.
[20:36] I heard someone dear calling me to his
[20:42] side.
[20:43] And I ran
[20:47] under his wings.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; And there
[20:54] he covered me.
[20:56] And now I can see.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; The enemy
[21:04] still looks for me. But what they cannot
[21:08] see is I'm under my Lord's wings.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; I'm under
[21:17] his wings.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; Thunder rolled, dark clouds hung low. I
[21:28] was out in a storm.
[21:32] I was shivering
[21:35] in the coldness there. No safe retreat
[21:40] from home.
[21:42] Then there blew strong winds. Would this
[21:45] be my end? Then I heard my friend. He
[21:50] was calling me to his side.
[21:55] And then I ran
[21:58] under his wings.
[22:02] Oh, and there
[22:05] he covered me
[22:08] &gt;&gt; and I can see
[22:12] for the enemy
[22:15] &gt;&gt; still looks for me.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; But what he cannot see is that I'm under
[22:22] my Lord's wings.
[22:25] Oh, I'm under
[22:28] his wings.
[22:30] [Music]
[22:33] &gt;&gt; Nighttime came, the shadows fell. I
[22:38] could not find my way.
[22:42] Oh, the tears of night took hold
[22:47] and I yearned for break of day. And then
[22:53] he saw my plight. And in the night he
[22:58] shined his light and called me to his
[23:03] side.
[23:05] And I ran
[23:08] under his wings.
[23:12] And there
[23:15] he covered me.
[23:17] And now I can't sing.
[23:22] Oh, the storm still rages. When the rock
[23:26] of ages, I'm resting.
[23:30] Oh, under my Lord's wings.
[23:34] Oh yes, I'm under
[23:37] his wings.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; You see the storm still rages, but I'm
[23:45] in the rock of ages. I'm resting.
[23:50] Go under my Lord wings.

[30:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hey, listen. Little
[30:29] &gt;&gt; by little.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Everything in the right direction. He
[30:32] said, "Well, it's been three or three
[30:34] plus months or so of unable to even
[30:38] swallow."
[30:40] So what we take for granted others now
[30:42] doctor's doctor
[30:45] &gt;&gt; they do their thing they cut they sew
[30:47] they splice they put things back
[30:48] together but God's the healer right
[30:51] &gt;&gt; so I'm asking God and you all just
[30:53] remember brother Kelly McMillan in your
[30:56] prayers and say God be merciful to him
[30:59] allow the the muscles and everything to
[31:02] come back and to you know the everything
[31:05] that it'll work and function right and
[31:07] and may the Lord bless him and he be
[31:10] completely come back to a place of
[31:13] restoration. Amen.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; So, praise the Lord. Amen. Let's just
[31:17] remain standing in Malachi chapter 3 and
[31:21] verse one. Malachi 3. Then we're going
[31:23] to go to Isaiah 40. Then we'll go to
[31:27] John 14. But what I'll do is I'll have
[31:29] you to just stand
[31:32] uh for this first reading and then we'll
[31:36] have you to sit down after that after we
[31:40] pray.
[31:43] Malachi chapter 3 and verse one. Behold,
[31:49] I will send my messenger,
[31:52] and he shall prepare the way before me,
[31:56] and the Lord whom you seek shall
[31:58] suddenly come to his temple, even the
[32:01] messenger of the covenant, whom he hath
[32:04] whom ye delight in. Behold, he shall
[32:07] come, saith the Lord of hosts. Amen.
[32:10] Heavenly Father, we have read your word.
[32:12] We ask for a blessing upon it. Open our
[32:14] eyes of understanding. Father, give us
[32:17] that spiritual illumination that only
[32:19] comes from you, Father. And we are
[32:22] totally dependent upon you. We are not
[32:24] looking to uh carnal interpretations,
[32:27] man's understanding, though that be
[32:29] good. We can study scripture. We can
[32:32] study the meaning of words. We can uh
[32:35] recite the Bible by memory. But unless
[32:37] you make it real to us by way of
[32:41] revelation, it only becomes knowledge.
[32:45] But father, you said that that knowledge
[32:47] would be okay. But there had to come a
[32:49] time when the knowledge there had to be
[32:52] an illumination strike it to make it
[32:55] real and alive. May each one here
[32:58] tonight, Father, be a part of that
[33:00] living word manifesting the life of
[33:04] Christ in this hour. We thank you. We
[33:06] praise you. We ask it in Jesus Christ's
[33:08] name.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. All right, you can be
[33:11] seated. But let's go to another portion
[33:14] of scripture. Isaiah 40.
[33:17] Amen. I've got these these half glasses.
[33:21] Half glasses. If somebody calls me Chuck
[33:23] Schumer, I'm going to throw these things
[33:25] away. I will hit them with a hammer. So,
[33:28] nobody say that.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[33:34] David. I knew you'd probably say
[33:36] something like that. The guy on the
[33:38] front row, the largest guy in the
[33:40] tallest guy anyway.
[33:42] But God bless you. Now, I won't hit it
[33:45] with a hammer, but you know.
[33:48] All right. Isaiah chapter 40 verses 3-5.
[33:53] Now the voice of him that crith in the
[33:56] wilderness.
[33:59] Prepare ye the way of the Lord make
[34:01] straight in the desert a highway for our
[34:06] God. Amen.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Every valley shall be exalted, every
[34:11] mountain and hill shall be made low,
[34:15] and the crooked shall be made straight,
[34:18] and the rough places plain,
[34:24] and the glory of the Lord shall be
[34:26] revealed,
[34:28] and all the flesh shall see it together,
[34:32] for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken
[34:34] it. Amen. Notice he's one who is crying
[34:39] in the wilderness. Now, the Bible says
[34:42] that he's going to he's going to fill up
[34:44] valleys. He's going to make mountains
[34:46] low. He's going to prepare a way, a
[34:48] highway. I want to ask you, when did you
[34:51] see that done in the ministry of John?
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Sometimes what these are is they are
[34:56] symbols of something that God is doing.
[35:01] He's not making crooked paths straight.
[35:03] We don't know of anywhere. He's not a
[35:05] highway uh construction man. He's going
[35:08] out here and he's making highways. We
[35:10] don't see them doing that. And yet God
[35:13] fulfills his word by bringing it to pass
[35:16] because God is his own interpreter.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; So one thing that we don't want to do is
[35:22] we want to say, well, uh I don't think
[35:24] John fulfilled that because nowhere in
[35:27] history do we see of one road that he
[35:29] made, one valley filled up, and one
[35:31] mountain made low. And yet God fulfilled
[35:34] it in the ministry of John.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. So it's in simple form. All right.
[35:38] John chapter 14 if you would. One more
[35:41] scripture. John chapter 14
[35:45] verses 1-4.
[35:49] Let not your heart be troubled. You
[35:52] believe in God. Believe also in me.
[35:56] In my father's house are many mansions.
[36:00] If it were not so, I would have told
[36:02] you. I go to prepare a place for you.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Wow, what comforting words.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[36:13] I will come again and receive you unto
[36:15] myself, that where I am,
[36:19] there ye may be also.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; I say yay and amen and amen and so be
[36:26] it, Lord. And come quickly. Yes, sir.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; And whether I go, you know, in the way
[36:33] you know. God, bless your word. Tonight,
[36:36] we're going to continue on with this
[36:38] thought. I didn't get to finish it
[36:40] actually this past Sunday. And so, I
[36:43] thought, well, hey, you know what I'll
[36:44] do is I'll take I got some good quotes.
[36:46] I got some really nice things. When you
[36:49] begin to look at this message and you
[36:52] don't look at it from the standpoint of
[36:55] carnal understanding, but you look at it
[36:57] through spiritual revelation and realize
[36:59] that all of you are associated with a
[37:03] messenger in this hour.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; And when you understand because angels
[37:07] are messengers,
[37:10] &gt;&gt; messengers are angels. The you have
[37:12] heavenly angels, you have earthly
[37:14] angels. I'm an angel right now behind
[37:17] the pulpit. I'm in a messenger. I'm
[37:18] bringing you.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Bringing you a message. And sometimes
[37:23] God will answer your prayer, give you
[37:25] what you have need of because you
[37:28] prayed, sent the prayer up to heaven.
[37:31] There was a connection made. God sent a
[37:34] word down even while the minister is
[37:36] ministering and you got your answer. And
[37:39] yet
[37:40] &gt;&gt; the minister himself may be oblivious to
[37:44] how it works.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; That's right. And yet God ministers
[37:49] to all no matter the age.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Aren't you Aren't you glad
[37:56] &gt;&gt; that this isn't uh you know the uh where
[37:59] you're divided up into uh advanced
[38:02] learning and the mediocre and the slow
[38:05] people over here. Uh you guys, you know,
[38:07] why don't you hang out in the forier
[38:09] because you're not getting it.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? Thank God
[38:12] that he puts us all together. But he
[38:15] does expect you to do your homework.
[38:17] Now,
[38:17] &gt;&gt; I've been known throughout the world
[38:19] that that I tell everybody, you do your
[38:21] homework.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Don't you leave it up to the minister to
[38:26] just sit here and study the message or
[38:28] the Bible for you.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; It is up to you to look into it.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; It's up to you to get into it. It's up
[38:35] to you to to look at it so that when the
[38:39] minister is ministering
[38:42] and you've heard the prophet say it.
[38:44] You've seen the Bible say it, you'll
[38:46] say, "Amen."
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Why? I know that to be true because let
[38:50] every man's word be a lie, but mine be
[38:52] the truth.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, I'm titling it again, a
[38:57] prepared place for a prepared people.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is part two. And again the
[39:04] subject is the bride has made or is
[39:06] making herself ready.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Now if you fail this test,
[39:14] you cannot blame it on anyone but
[39:17] yourself.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; If you miss it,
[39:20] &gt;&gt; you blew it.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; You were foolish.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to put all of you into
[39:26] bride material.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; I can't make you bride.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. But what I do remember now
[39:33] there are five wise and five foolish and
[39:36] all of them made bride material.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together on that?
[39:44] &gt;&gt; So we don't want to glory the fact that
[39:46] hey we heard the shout we heard a
[39:48] message we've received the messenger.
[39:51] Praise God we're in the message. I want
[39:53] to know is the message in you? Yes.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Has this messenger had an effect on you
[39:59] that your life has changed? If your life
[40:02] is not changing, there's something
[40:04] wrong.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Because he's changing you from the glory
[40:09] of this terrestrial to the glory of
[40:12] something celestial.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are we are gaining
[40:19] understanding
[40:22] as we serve the Lord in this last hour.
[40:25] Now um I would like to say that this
[40:30] prepared place
[40:32] now understand that for both the bride
[40:36] or let's put all bride material there is
[40:39] a place even foolish virgin have a place
[40:45] &gt;&gt; are they lost
[40:47] &gt;&gt; do they not have eternal life
[40:50] &gt;&gt; no they have eternal life
[40:51] &gt;&gt; amen
[40:52] &gt;&gt; okay but if they are foolish
[40:56] and they miss the rapture because that's
[40:58] God's final purging.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; You talk about God's final separation.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Two in a bed, one taken, two in a field,
[41:08] one taken.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Okay, that's God doing it. God's doing
[41:12] the separation. So, the bride receives
[41:14] her judgment. Now, she hears the word.
[41:17] She brings it to herself. It's
[41:19] self-evaluation.
[41:20] You see it, you hear it, you say, "I
[41:23] need to do better." and you make things
[41:24] right.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Foolish virgin, my Lord de delays his
[41:28] coming. I dillydally. I put uh not so
[41:31] much emphasis on the word and what we
[41:34] need to do and therefore my career and
[41:36] church is not so important and I don't
[41:38] really read my Bible like I should and
[41:41] everything, but I love God and and you
[41:43] know, so I'm in the message. I want to
[41:46] make sure I I I want to provoke all of
[41:49] you
[41:51] &gt;&gt; unto good works. Amen.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; I do. I want to provoke you. And that
[41:55] means poking you once in a while, making
[41:57] you a little uncomfortable,
[41:59] &gt;&gt; okay? That you know, listen, we're not
[42:01] all going.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; There is a rapture that's coming and
[42:05] it's coming soon.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; He sends a messenger before
[42:11] he comes to prepare the way.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; That's what this message is all about.
[42:16] It's not about long skirts. It's not
[42:18] about long hair and no makeup and and
[42:21] and boys don't swim with the girls. You
[42:24] don't kiss before marriage and on and
[42:26] on. We've made it rules and regulations,
[42:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Because that's carnal without
[42:32] understanding.
[42:34] And if I could get you to that place
[42:38] where you have a personal relationship
[42:41] with Jesus Christ.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. that you wake up in the morning
[42:46] and
[42:48] what's on your mind are things of the
[42:50] Lord. Now listen, let's let's face it.
[42:52] We all have carnal things that we've got
[42:55] to do. You've got to go to work. You've
[42:57] got to,
[42:59] you know, drive your car. You got to
[43:03] face family. You got to
[43:06] pay the bills.
[43:08] All of those things. But Jesus said that
[43:12] we've got to place our priorities on
[43:14] something that's even higher.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of
[43:19] God." And all these things.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Well, all these things are not to have
[43:25] that priority over even going to church.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:32] So, understand
[43:35] that there is a prepared place.
[43:38] It's not just a location.
[43:42] It's not just a location, but a
[43:44] condition.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; I've prepared a place
[43:48] that you can get to the place. Have you
[43:50] ever uh been fed up? You've ever had
[43:54] somebody press your button and hey, you
[43:56] put me in this place. It's you. Well,
[44:00] hey, what it is, you're just telling
[44:02] everybody, well, hey, you know, I'm not
[44:04] there. I'm not ready for it.
[44:07] I'm not in that place.
[44:09] Well, pray, read your Bible, sensitize
[44:13] yourself to the things of God.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Because if you are desensitized to the
[44:18] things of God, there can be all kinds of
[44:21] supernatural things happening around
[44:23] you. You could be riding a mule and a
[44:25] mule try to talk to you and you'll talk
[44:27] back to the mule.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; You'll miss it.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. The meal will tell you,
[44:33] "Ha, haven't I been your faithful mule?
[44:36] Haven't I been the car to take you to
[44:38] work all the time and everything and
[44:39] you're
[44:43] &gt;&gt; You see, saints of God, we can
[44:45] desensitize ourselves to the
[44:47] supernatural. God may send a messenger.
[44:49] God may send somebody your way. God may
[44:52] have a sermon preached just for you, and
[44:55] you're so carnal, you miss it.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; You sit there with your folded arms. You
[44:59] sit there uh uh desensitized
[45:03] to the things of God because you know
[45:05] what? You weren't praying and reaping.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Be not deceived. God is not mocked.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Because whatsoever you sow
[45:14] to, you're going to reap from. That's
[45:16] why you cannot pray enough and read your
[45:20] Bible enough and get alone with God. Now
[45:24] remember one of the secrets of the third
[45:26] pole is I'll meet you in there.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Well, where is there?
[45:32] &gt;&gt; The prophet asked the angel, why there?
[45:35] Why that little room? Is it not written
[45:37] in the scripture that if you will seek
[45:40] him in private, he'll
[45:42] &gt;&gt; he'll bless you openly?
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Get in your prayer closet. the last
[45:48] couple days, you know, uh listen, I've
[45:50] had a hard time sleeping and yes, you
[45:52] know, back problems and different
[45:54] things, but I've sat up. I got up and I
[45:57] sat and I didn't I didn't get on my cell
[46:00] phone. I didn't get on an iPad. I didn't
[46:02] do anything. I just sat there in the
[46:05] dark meditating and praying to God.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what a blessing it is
[46:12] to just think on him.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, a prepared place, not just a
[46:19] location, because now a prepared place
[46:22] for a prepared people. If you're
[46:25] prepared, where is that place that we're
[46:27] going to? We're going to the new
[46:30] Jerusalem.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; And that's for bride only. It's going to
[46:33] be a sign right over the door, bride
[46:35] only.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Foolish virgin will not have their home
[46:42] in the new Jerusalem. They'll be saved,
[46:45] but they'll be outside the city.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; So, it's only for the Holy Ghost fil
[46:53] those that got oil. Okay. So, it's also
[46:57] about a relationship
[46:59] because the relationship is changed
[47:02] from servants unto friends.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; From woman unto wife, from church unto
[47:10] bride. Amen.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; And a place means a position.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; So once you find your position and you
[47:20] have authority, guess what? Your name is
[47:24] as good on the check as his.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; In fact, you're sitting on the same
[47:28] throne.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; You're co-equal
[47:33] with him. And I know that's that that's
[47:36] a little bit odd. And sometimes I think,
[47:38] you know, whoa, I got to be careful with
[47:40] that because I don't want to try to take
[47:42] his place and push him off the throne.
[47:44] No,
[47:45] &gt;&gt; we are subject to him in all things.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; All right.
[47:50] So, adoption
[47:52] is positioning and pleasing.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Now, understand, there are many that are
[47:57] going to be saved, but few sealed.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; You understand the difference?
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Salvation is of the Lord. Then if you
[48:05] give your heart to Jesus Christ and
[48:07] you've been baptized and everything,
[48:09] guess what? If you believe unto him,
[48:11] receive his words, you have eternal
[48:12] life, shall not come into condemnation,
[48:15] right? And so we understand that they'll
[48:18] they're going to be saved. They praise
[48:20] the Lord. Salvation. Hallelujah. Thank
[48:22] you, Lord. I receive the blood. That
[48:24] doesn't mean you're sealed.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Because have you received the Holy Ghost
[48:30] &gt;&gt; since you believe?
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Well, I didn't know there was a Holy
[48:33] Ghost. Well, I'm telling you, without
[48:35] the oil, you're not going in rapture.
[48:37] Without the oil, you'll not be in the
[48:39] new Jerusalem.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; So, how important is it?
[48:44] &gt;&gt; It is of extreme importance.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Now, teaching is good. Teaching is real
[48:50] good. You can have teachers come in and
[48:52] oo you and awe you with graphs and and
[48:56] quotes and different things and oh, I
[48:58] never saw it that way. But I'll tell you
[49:00] what we need. We need preaching with the
[49:03] inspiration to get you, let's say,
[49:06] provoked into doing better than what you
[49:09] did today.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Somebody say amen to that.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Here, I don't want to be that preacher
[49:16] that says, "Can you say amen?" Yeah, I
[49:18] can, but
[49:21] I get caught in my own. All right. Now
[49:26] uh in Malachi 4 which we all claim to be
[49:30] a part of of this prophetic word in this
[49:32] end time. Behold I will send you Elijah
[49:36] the prophet before the coming of the
[49:39] great and dreadful day of the Lord. What
[49:41] will be great and what will be dreadful?
[49:43] To miss it is dreadful
[49:46] &gt;&gt; because to miss the great day of the
[49:48] Lord means you're going to have a
[49:50] dreadful day. You're going to miss it.
[49:52] You're going into tribulation, weeping
[49:55] and wailing and nashing of teeth, right?
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Okay. So,
[50:01] and he shall turn the heart of the
[50:04] fathers to the children, comma,
[50:10] &gt;&gt; very important. And the heart of the
[50:12] children to the fathers. There's two
[50:13] parts of the prophecy,
[50:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Heart of the fathers to the children and
[50:18] the children to the fathers. So there's
[50:21] two parts of this. And John fulfilled
[50:24] the first part of the prophecy
[50:27] that says the heart of the fathers to
[50:29] the children. It's identified in
[50:31] scripture. I'm going to show you. You
[50:33] all are message believers. You're all
[50:35] Bible believers. And we have to go back
[50:37] to the Bible to substantiate these
[50:41] teachings because a prophet, a real
[50:44] prophet of God, doesn't come and add to
[50:46] the word.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; He reveals what's already there.
[50:50] Wow.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; He he tells you because he'll say,
[50:55] "Well, the Bible says in Matthew 28:19
[50:58] to go into all the world and preach the
[51:00] gospel and them that believe, let him be
[51:02] baptized in the name of Father, Son, and
[51:04] Holy Ghost." And yet, no one in the
[51:06] Bible was ever baptized, Father, Son,
[51:08] and Holy Ghost. That's right.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; So, either the disciples missed exactly
[51:13] what Jesus told him to do. Or there's a
[51:15] revelation behind what is the name of
[51:18] the father,
[51:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:20] &gt;&gt; The son and holy ghost. Because Jesus
[51:22] said, "I came in my father's name. You
[51:24] didn't receive me."
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; On the day of Pentecost, Acts chapter 2,
[51:29] when Peter was standing there as a great
[51:31] spokesman, men and brethren, what do we
[51:33] do to be saved?
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Repent and be baptized in the name of
[51:38] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; He says, "Because this Jesus whom you
[51:42] have crucified, God has made him both
[51:45] Lord and Christ."
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; What is the name of the father? Lord,
[51:50] what is the son? Jesus, Christ, holy
[51:52] ghost. What is the name of the father,
[51:54] son, holy ghost? It's a mystery.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[52:00] &gt;&gt; It took a prophet to come out. And
[52:02] people say, "Well, it really doesn't
[52:04] matter." It does matter
[52:05] &gt;&gt; because in the scripture, how were you
[52:06] baptized? Amen.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; And he caught and he told them to get
[52:10] rebaptized. That's why if you say,
[52:12] "Well, I got baptized way back when I
[52:15] was a a kid and I really didn't know and
[52:17] I was a Baptist. I was this or that and
[52:20] I really uh I think it was father, son,
[52:22] holy ghost. You should get rebaptized."
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Okay, that we'll just go on. Now, watch
[52:28] what brother Brennham says. So, I want
[52:30] to substantiate some things here
[52:33] in the message questions and answers
[52:35] 1964.
[52:38] In Malachi 4, this Elijah is to take the
[52:41] hearts of the fathers to the children
[52:44] and then the hearts of the children to
[52:46] the fathers. Is this the same person?
[52:50] Yes, the same person. All right. Well,
[52:53] wait a minute. No, pardon me. I'm sorry.
[52:57] See the Holy Spirit, catch that for me
[52:59] then?
[53:00] &gt;&gt; No, it's not the same person.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:05] I I I love how brother Brennham is so
[53:07] honest.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; He'll immediately say, "Oh, no. Hey, I'm
[53:10] sorry. Hey, thank God for the Holy
[53:12] Spirit that can quicken us. There's been
[53:15] multitudes of times the prophet said
[53:18] he's answering a question and he answers
[53:20] it wrong."
[53:22] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, he feels grieved.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Oh man, is something wrong? Is there
[53:27] somebody sick? Did Did I say something?
[53:30] Um uh read that question again.
[53:34] Amen.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; And oh really oh lookucky there. He said
[53:38] I kind of felt like taking candy from a
[53:40] baby or something. I just it wasn't
[53:42] right.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; And so I want you to understand the
[53:46] sensitivity of the Holy Spirit is
[53:49] absolutely imperative because there are
[53:51] times when you may be thinking what you
[53:54] are saying is correct and Holy Spirit
[53:56] quicken you
[53:58] &gt;&gt; and God humble all of us. Okay? That we
[54:02] would have that that meek nature to say,
[54:05] "No, I said that wrong. I'm sorry."
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Now, I tell you what, um, we as
[54:11] ministers stand up here all the time and
[54:14] we're saying things and sometimes you'll
[54:16] say, "Moses built an ark and and uh, you
[54:19] know, he went through the flood and you
[54:21] all know, yeah." And you're going, "That
[54:23] guy's adding to the word, you know, or
[54:26] whatever. He's got no, it's just a slip
[54:28] of the tongue
[54:29] &gt;&gt; and we all do that." Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; You've done it with your families.
[54:33] You've done it with your wife. You've
[54:34] done it with your kids. I just said I
[54:36] told you. And everybody around the table
[54:38] said, "No, Dad. You didn't say it that
[54:40] way."
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, I did. No, you And so you got three
[54:44] or four against one. And then you
[54:47] finally say, "Okay, well, you know what
[54:49] I meant."
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; We all want grace for ourselves, but
[54:55] others, you know, we would want to pin
[54:57] them to it.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, brother Brennham, what was in
[55:02] Malachi 3? Sir, I send my messenger
[55:05] before my face, which was Elijah in
[55:08] Malachi 4 turns back around and says,
[55:10] "Behold, I send you Elijah." Malachi 3,
[55:13] he was to take a messenger sent before
[55:16] the face of the Lord Jesus, which was
[55:18] John. How many understands that? Malachi
[55:21] 4 when this Elijah comes immediately
[55:24] after that his message and things and
[55:26] after is the coming of the Lord and the
[55:29] renewing of the earth. Wow. Praise the
[55:31] Lord. So this messenger that we have in
[55:34] this time in Malachi 4 in turning the
[55:37] hearts of the father or the children to
[55:40] back to the Pentecostal fathers.
[55:42] Understand God's got to return us back
[55:46] to the pure word.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not man's interpretations, not
[55:50] denominational ideas. God circumcised
[55:53] this message
[55:55] &gt;&gt; by giving angels messengers
[55:59] to send to brother Brennham. And he
[56:01] said, "There I I I I'm alone. I I I went
[56:04] and studied back. You all know I
[56:05] preached the seals before and I was aund
[56:08] miles from the church." Right.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Each seal came and brought
[56:14] and broke to me the seal as example, the
[56:17] first seal, the white horse rider."
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now you all know I've
[56:22] taught that down through." And if you go
[56:24] back and listen to the sermons, the
[56:25] mighty conqueror prior to the opening of
[56:28] the seals in each one, he says that
[56:31] white horse rider, who is it? It's Jesus
[56:33] Christ riding down through the ages.
[56:36] And then when the opening of the first
[56:37] seal comes, oh my, I was I was so wrong.
[56:41] It's not Jesus Christ. It's the
[56:42] Antichrist.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Now understand, God's spirit corrects
[56:47] prophets when they make errors.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; That doesn't offend you, does it?
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Well, oh, God forbid, Brother Ron, that
[56:56] you would ever say a prophet made an
[56:58] error because they always have thus
[57:00] sayith the Lord. And everything they say
[57:02] is thus sayith the Lord. And and how can
[57:04] you say that? Well, I'll tell you
[57:07] because if the prophet is corrected by
[57:09] the spirit of God, then we say yay and
[57:12] amen and we receive the correction as he
[57:14] received correction.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Because if you teach your children,
[57:19] well, they're both correct. They're both
[57:21] right.
[57:23] Then you'll your kids will have such a a
[57:25] spirit of confusion and say, "Uh, I
[57:29] guess there ain't much to this message
[57:31] because uh how can it be the antichrist
[57:34] and Christ himself?" You see what I'm
[57:36] saying? It doesn't compute.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; So when the spirit of God comes and
[57:42] corrects the prophet, I thank God
[57:45] &gt;&gt; that we follow along with the unfolding
[57:48] of the word
[57:50] &gt;&gt; as it unfolds to the prophet. and then
[57:53] he admits, "Wow, I taught this wrong
[57:55] before."
[57:57] &gt;&gt; But when God in season corrects him and
[57:59] he corrects it, we receive it.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; That's why I will say that it's very
[58:04] important that if you listen to the
[58:07] tapes in chronological order and you
[58:10] went from 47 to 65, you would very
[58:13] clearly see that.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you go from 65 to 57 over
[58:18] here to 61 and then over to 64 and
[58:22] everything and and and oh man, you will
[58:25] get quotes that will look as though
[58:27] they're contradictory
[58:29] &gt;&gt; and they will be
[58:31] &gt;&gt; because he taught it differently,
[58:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Prior to the opening of the seals, try
[58:36] man is a triune being
[58:39] body, soul, spirit.
[58:43] But with the opening of the No, no, no,
[58:45] no, no.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Body, spirit, soul, soul is the inside.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? And so when Okay, I'm
[58:54] just doing a little bit of teaching
[58:55] there so that all of you when the
[58:58] prophet of God receives correction from
[59:01] the Holy Spirit, we don't it it doesn't
[59:03] stumble us.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Well, I thought every word is dust. No,
[59:08] no, it's not. Even the apostle Paul
[59:11] said, "These things I say unto you, not
[59:14] as from the Lord, just me telling you."
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham tells us those things
[59:19] too. So anyway,
[59:22] let's go to Luke chapter 1. I want to
[59:24] show you from the scriptures. Luke 1
[59:28] 11-1 17. And there appeared unto him an
[59:31] angel of the Lord. And we're talking
[59:33] about Zachcharias. And Zachcharias,
[59:35] remember, there's been an angel
[59:37] messenger come to Elizabeth. you're
[59:38] going to have a child and comes to him
[59:41] and appears to him and remember now he
[59:43] becomes dumb the angel because he
[59:45] doesn't really believe what's going to
[59:47] happen and so now God takes his speech
[59:50] from him and so now we come into this
[59:52] portion of scripture
[59:55] uh and there appeared unto him an angel
[59:58] of the Lord standing on the right side
[1:00:00] of the altar of incense and when
[1:00:02] Zachariah saw him he was troubled and
[1:00:05] fear fell upon him and the angel said to
[1:00:08] him. Fear not, Zacharias, for thy prayer
[1:00:10] is heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall
[1:00:12] bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his
[1:00:14] name John,
[1:00:18] and thou shalt have joy and gladness,
[1:00:21] and many shall rejoice at his birth, for
[1:00:24] he shall be great in the sight of the
[1:00:26] Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor
[1:00:29] strong drink, and he shall be filled
[1:00:31] with the Holy Ghost, even from his
[1:00:33] mother's womb, before the Holy Spirit
[1:00:36] even fell on the day of Pentecost, John
[1:00:39] came forth out of his mother's womb with
[1:00:41] the Holy Spirit.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Don't put God in a box.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. And many of the children of Israel
[1:00:53] shall he turn to the Lord their God, and
[1:00:56] he shall go before him, who? The Lord.
[1:01:00] He shall go before him in the spirit and
[1:01:02] power of Elias
[1:01:06] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:01:08] children.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; He stops right there.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Doesn't say the other part and the
[1:01:16] children to the fathers.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; The scripture is exact.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; And the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[1:01:24] just and to make a people prepared for
[1:01:28] the Lord. Praise God. That's why why God
[1:01:31] sends messengers. That's why
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; that's why we are so different than
[1:01:35] denomination.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; They have the same Bible
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; and no messenger.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; To prepare them because you know what?
[1:01:44] They don't know the kind of life to that
[1:01:47] lives that's pleasing to God.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. So they can live any kind
[1:01:52] of life.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; And there's no correction.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Because as many as I love, I rebuke and
[1:02:00] chasen.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; If you are without correction, you are a
[1:02:03] bastard child. That's the scripture.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; So don't ever look at others and say,
[1:02:08] "Well, they do that and God is still
[1:02:10] blessing them." Well, listen. Um God
[1:02:13] only corrects his.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So, if you've ever had
[1:02:18] the corrective hand of God on your life,
[1:02:21] that's a very good sign you're his.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Now, if you're doing things and you are
[1:02:27] like the blackbird or the buzzard who
[1:02:30] goes out and eats uh dead carrying and
[1:02:32] then comes to church and eats the the
[1:02:35] pure word and he says, "And you can go
[1:02:37] out here and live in the things of the
[1:02:39] world and then come into the word." And
[1:02:41] he says, "And you can eat from both." He
[1:02:43] said, "Uh, you're a hypocrite. You you
[1:02:46] what? You're you're a crow sticking in
[1:02:48] dub feathers. Look at me. I'm a message
[1:02:50] believer. You don't believe it? Here's
[1:02:52] my quotes.
[1:02:53] Look at me. Because they got their
[1:02:56] quotes.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; All right. Now watch
[1:03:06] verse 77. to give knowledge of salvation
[1:03:09] unto his people by the remission of
[1:03:11] their sins. Through the tender mercy of
[1:03:13] our God, whereby the dayspring from our
[1:03:17] high hath visited us, to give light to
[1:03:20] them that sit in darkness,
[1:03:22] and in the shadow of death, to guide our
[1:03:25] feet into the way of peace. And the
[1:03:28] child grew and waxed strong in the
[1:03:31] spirit, and was in the desert deserts
[1:03:34] till the day of his showing unto Israel.
[1:03:37] I think brother Bram said he went in
[1:03:40] even as a young man, nine years of age,
[1:03:42] left his family, went out and he had a a
[1:03:45] diet of locust and honey. I've often
[1:03:49] wondered
[1:03:50] if I went and visited him
[1:03:53] and said, "What's for dinner?" Locust
[1:03:56] and honey.
[1:03:58] I wonder, "Were they still alive? Did
[1:04:00] they cook them? Did they flash fry
[1:04:03] them?" I don't know. I've I've been to
[1:04:06] Hey, I I've been to places in Zimbabwe.
[1:04:09] I've been places in Congo and they eat
[1:04:12] them a pony worm.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they eat ants. I've sprinkled them
[1:04:18] on my food. Little crackly things, you
[1:04:21] know, snap, crackle, pop, put them on
[1:04:22] your food. They were cooked ants. I
[1:04:26] didn't know what they were, but didn't
[1:04:27] taste bad. After I knew what they were,
[1:04:33] I I got my wife.
[1:04:35] I took a mop up honey worm and I bit it
[1:04:37] and I just swallowed it. Just no
[1:04:39] chewing, just
[1:04:43] good. So she took it and she chewed it.
[1:04:46] Oh man. Oshy gushy
[1:04:49] thing. So
[1:04:53] uh locust and wild honey.
[1:04:57] It was a different type of diet. I'm
[1:05:00] sure all of you would probably lose
[1:05:01] weight.
[1:05:06] So God uses the spirit of Elijah five
[1:05:09] times.
[1:05:11] God said he loved that spirit of Elijah
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; because he was a one-man army.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; When there needed to be a man to come in
[1:05:21] and correct, I don't care if it's 450
[1:05:24] false prophets. He come in there, man.
[1:05:25] It's Mark Mount Carmel. I and I alone.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Okay. And he he he tells them, "Hey,
[1:05:33] maybe you're God. Go ahead and jump up
[1:05:34] and down. Get all exciting. Cut
[1:05:36] yourself. Maybe your God's on vacation.
[1:05:38] Maybe he need maybe he's uh needs
[1:05:41] hearing aids and you need to cry louder.
[1:05:43] And they made so much until the altar of
[1:05:46] God was broken down and everything." He
[1:05:48] mocked him
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; until there there was no answer.
[1:05:55] And he said, "Now go ahead and and and
[1:05:58] baptize the altar. I want you to, you
[1:06:01] know," and he and he says, "And let the
[1:06:03] God who answers by fire, let him be
[1:06:05] God."
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; And they all said, "Yay and amen, and we
[1:06:09] will serve that kind of God." And all of
[1:06:10] a suen,
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; even the rocks were disintegrated.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Okay, that listen, even when God does
[1:06:18] the supernatural, people they back up on
[1:06:21] it say, "Well, it could have been an
[1:06:23] illusion. And I think maybe it was a
[1:06:24] mirage.
[1:06:26] You know, God does things supernatural
[1:06:28] and a lot of times people want to
[1:06:29] explain it away. Oh, it was some kind of
[1:06:31] missile.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; It was some kind of figment of their
[1:06:34] imagination. Actually, brother Brenham
[1:06:37] said that God can judge this generation
[1:06:40] from the picture
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; with the pillar of fire. It said the
[1:06:44] picture is greater proof than you seeing
[1:06:47] it yourself. Amen.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Because if you've ever seen something
[1:06:51] odd, unusual, I saw a light. Oh my.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Well, did I really see it?
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Was it a light? Was it a refraction? Did
[1:07:00] somebody have a laser beam and trying
[1:07:02] to, you know, see what I'm saying?
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; And he said that that woman that looked
[1:07:08] at that picture and she smirked, she
[1:07:11] blasphemed the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:07:17] God uses the spirit of Elijah five
[1:07:20] times. Elijah, Elisha got a double
[1:07:23] portion. Do you know the bride's
[1:07:25] supposed to get a double portion?
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; I just bring this to your me. Then John
[1:07:32] the Baptist.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; And then the Elijah spirit sent in this
[1:07:37] day who we call the prophet of the hour
[1:07:42] which was brother Brandham. But the real
[1:07:43] prophet of the hour and understand this
[1:07:46] quote. Brother Brim said, "The real
[1:07:47] prophet of this hour is the Holy
[1:07:50] Spirit."
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; He said he's the real prophet of every
[1:07:54] hour.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Okay. And then the last and final coming
[1:08:02] will be Elijah, one of the two witnesses
[1:08:04] to come back to the Jews. And if you
[1:08:07] miss the fourth coming of Elijah, which
[1:08:10] is in this hour,
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; you will see the next one.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. It'll be on CNN. It'll
[1:08:17] be on Fox News. It'll be on your iPad.
[1:08:19] And all of you will see Moses and Elijah
[1:08:22] calling plagues and doing all these
[1:08:24] things. And if you see that,
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; you know right well, right then, you
[1:08:28] done missed it.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; God help us
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; to understand this forthcoming of
[1:08:36] Elijah. That's why. Listen. You want to
[1:08:38] know how Elijah preached? Put on a tape.
[1:08:45] We were listening to a tape the other
[1:08:46] night. Um, spoken word is the original
[1:08:49] seed. And boy, you talk about rough
[1:08:54] rough.
[1:08:55] He is he is going after that
[1:08:57] denominational spirit, the spirit of uh
[1:08:59] Jezebel, mystery Babylon, and he's
[1:09:02] hitting that thing so hard. Um, I tell
[1:09:04] you what, most of you would probably get
[1:09:07] really offended at me if I spoke like
[1:09:09] that, like he did on Spoken Words, the
[1:09:12] original seat. But he was a one-man
[1:09:14] army.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen, sir.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Without fear or favor. He wasn't trying
[1:09:19] to make friends.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; He was here to prepare.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Listen. Listen. I'm going to say like
[1:09:25] the woman said, no man speak like him.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:29] You take Oral Roberts,
[1:09:32] you take Jimmy Swagger,
[1:09:35] you take all of these different great
[1:09:38] men of God in this hour. Billy Graham,
[1:09:42] great men
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; with great ministries.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; But no one spake like this one.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I can say
[1:09:54] yay and amen to that. Yes.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; And that was life-changing to me.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; That's what caused me to come out from
[1:10:02] among them
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; and be ye separate
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; because God is a separator. He's not a
[1:10:08] mixer.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Man likes mixers. God likes separators.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[1:10:17] so let me ask you a question right now.
[1:10:19] And boy, I I'm going to have to hurry
[1:10:21] here. If you are looking for a prophecy
[1:10:24] to be fulfilled
[1:10:26] in this hour and you miss it, why would
[1:10:29] you miss it?
[1:10:35] If God fulfills and he's the interpreter
[1:10:37] of his own word and you miss the
[1:10:41] prophecy being fulfilled, here's how it
[1:10:43] can happen. because you listen to some
[1:10:46] man's interpretation,
[1:10:48] his opinion, and he told you, "Well, uh,
[1:10:52] I'll tell you, he didn't really mean
[1:10:54] that. He means this."
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; And because you listen to someone else,
[1:11:00] you'll say, "Well, listen. When the
[1:11:03] Messiah comes, okay,
[1:11:08] he's going to do this. In fact, the
[1:11:10] king, he's coming as king. And when he
[1:11:13] comes out of heaven, why all of the why
[1:11:17] Caiaphas and all of the high priests and
[1:11:19] all of the people and the religious
[1:11:21] people will recognize and there'll be a
[1:11:24] rampart come out of heaven and all the
[1:11:26] eyes of the world will see and King
[1:11:29] Theophony will come down and they'll all
[1:11:32] worship him and God baby.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Why it had to be shepherds? Y
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; everybody else missed it
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; except for blind Anna and Simeon.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; And Simeon was told by the Holy Spirit.
[1:11:51] I think I got the scriptures here. But
[1:11:53] he says Simeon was told by the Holy
[1:11:55] Spirit that his eyes before he dies
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; shall see the coming of God's Messiah.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Right? So here he is in the temple
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; and and and Mary is bringing baby Jesus
[1:12:06] in to become circumcised
[1:12:09] and did and and and and Simeon. Wow.
[1:12:13] He's led of the spirit.
[1:12:17] May I may I see that that baby?
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Mine eyes
[1:12:26] have seen the prophecy.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:30] what he had seen in the spirit, now he
[1:12:32] sees in a physical manifestation.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; And as he's worshiping,
[1:12:38] here comes blind Anna.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Being led of the spirit and she comes
[1:12:44] over.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, sometimes blind people
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; can see far better than people who have
[1:12:51] eyesight.
[1:12:53] You just have to be led of the Holy
[1:12:55] Spirit because the sight you have from
[1:12:58] God by manifestation of revelation is
[1:13:01] far greater
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; than your physical sight because we walk
[1:13:05] by faith and not by sight.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; So if you miss it,
[1:13:16] it's probably because you listen to
[1:13:18] somebody else's interpretation. That's
[1:13:20] why let them Hey, God fulfills his word
[1:13:24] the way he wants to.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; And if you're not careful because
[1:13:28] somebody taught you differently, you
[1:13:30] say, "Nope, nope. Can't. Nope. Nope.
[1:13:31] Sorry. Nope. It won't be that way." Just
[1:13:35] just say, "Hey, God, if you're going to
[1:13:38] fulfill your word, uh I don't care how
[1:13:42] you do it.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Let me see it when it's done."
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:13:49] So loud you see in church age. Now watch
[1:13:52] what kind of nature will Elijah have. So
[1:13:55] now he's going to explain what kind of
[1:13:57] this Elijah that's coming in this day.
[1:13:59] What kind of nature is he going to have?
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; First he'll be a mighty prophet true to
[1:14:05] the word of God.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; For Elijah was true and John was true.
[1:14:09] That's right. Doing signs and wonders
[1:14:12] will turn the hearts of the children
[1:14:13] back to the faith of the Pentecostal
[1:14:16] fathers. And he will hate denominations
[1:14:18] like Elijah did.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; What kind of nature will he have? I hate
[1:14:22] that denomination. Not the people.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; The system.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; The system,
[1:14:30] not the people.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:34] He will. I think we just got the thing
[1:14:37] started from for him now. About time he
[1:14:41] gets to come. And he's he's saying it.
[1:14:45] It's about time for that Elijah to show
[1:14:47] up on the scene. And here's his nature
[1:14:49] and what he's going to do. He's going to
[1:14:50] hate denomination. And all of us are
[1:14:52] doing the check marks. Uh hate
[1:14:54] denomination.
[1:14:56] Um
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; and yet you could be carnally and say,
[1:15:01] "Oh, he said we're waiting for him to
[1:15:03] come."
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; And we're sitting there. There he is.
[1:15:07] That's him. Okay.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; You Pharisees said, "You bunch of viper
[1:15:13] snakes in the grass." He's preaching
[1:15:14] serpenty.
[1:15:17] Other words, for I tell you, God is able
[1:15:19] of these stones to raise children to
[1:15:21] Abraham. Elijah said, "They're all gone
[1:15:23] astray. Every one of them. Nobody left
[1:15:24] but me alone. Oh my.
[1:15:27] He will hate fancy women."
[1:15:30] Elijah did. Jezebel. Is that right?
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; John did. Herodiius. Both them prophets.
[1:15:36] The spirit, the same spirit. They hated
[1:15:38] denominational world
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; and the church world. Wait a second.
[1:15:43] What is it?
[1:15:45] I thought we're supposed to love
[1:15:47] everybody.
[1:15:50] I I I thought God is love and they're
[1:15:54] going to hate denomination and hate the
[1:15:56] church world.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Now understand, it's the spirit
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; of the system because this system is
[1:16:03] bringing
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said Satan's Eden. He
[1:16:07] says, "Watch this." End time comes in
[1:16:10] with a religious spirit bringing
[1:16:13] everyone to worship together
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; and receive a sign and the mark of the
[1:16:18] beast.
[1:16:20] We are one in the spirit. We are one in
[1:16:25] the Lord. Doesn't matter what kind of
[1:16:28] way we serve God. Doesn't matter. They
[1:16:30] can do it with their short cropped hair,
[1:16:34] their immoral clothes. Amen.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; The rain, the same rain
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; that falls on the just falls on the
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; unjust.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Now, if it was me, I wouldn't fall on
[1:16:51] the unjust.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; I would make everybody see that only the
[1:16:56] just are blessed. But that's not God.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; So, the anointings, we're not just
[1:17:03] saying, "Well, I'm going to judge by the
[1:17:04] anointing." Because you know what? You
[1:17:06] can take some of these people
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; and let me tell you, they're truly
[1:17:10] worshshiping and sometimes I think they
[1:17:13] put us to shame because you know what
[1:17:14] they do? They really they open
[1:17:16] themselves. But the thing is they don't
[1:17:19] realize a deceptive religious spirit has
[1:17:24] told them they're okay and so they can
[1:17:26] worship God
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; and they're there and and you know what
[1:17:30] and I'm not at all making fun of that.
[1:17:35] No sir, I would not do that.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; The deceptive
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; is they will believe a lie
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; and be damned.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; There is a way that seemth right unto a
[1:17:51] man, but the end thereof is
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; death. Now watch this. He will hate
[1:17:56] fancy women. Elijah did. Jezebel. They
[1:18:00] hated the denomination world, the church
[1:18:02] world. They hated also fancy and no good
[1:18:05] women. They something in their spirit
[1:18:08] cried out against the thing. Jezebel was
[1:18:10] after Elijah's head and was going to cut
[1:18:13] it off. And she also had John's head cut
[1:18:15] off. Herodiius did both of them.
[1:18:21] So that's why denomination
[1:18:25] wants to destroy the ministry of William
[1:18:28] Brandham.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; It's false prophet.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Sure. You will find if you go type in
[1:18:33] William Brandham end time message or
[1:18:35] whatever, you're going to come up with
[1:18:37] more websites of everything that was
[1:18:39] wrong and he said this and on and on and
[1:18:41] he's my could be family, could be people
[1:18:44] from the Brandom Tabernacle, could all
[1:18:47] of that and and they've got their thing.
[1:18:48] Well, he was wrong. And you people that
[1:18:50] follow this quote message of the hour,
[1:18:52] you're all deceived.
[1:18:57] And if you can let them persuade you,
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; you will be persuaded.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; But upon this rock, I will build my
[1:19:07] church and the gates of hell will not
[1:19:10] prevail against it. But you know what?
[1:19:11] There'll be times when you're going to
[1:19:13] be tested and people are going to, you
[1:19:15] know, one brother called me up, "Brother
[1:19:16] Ron, will you give me just a few
[1:19:18] minutes? Just a few minutes. I want to
[1:19:20] show you all the places brother Brennan
[1:19:22] was wrong. And if you'll just give me
[1:19:25] and I said, "Brother, if you want to go
[1:19:26] to lunch, I'll go to lunch with you. If
[1:19:27] you want to go have dinner, I'll buy you
[1:19:29] dinner."
[1:19:31] I said, "But if you have come to try to
[1:19:33] prove to me that he was wrong in all the
[1:19:35] places he was wrong, you're too late."
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Too late.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; I've crossed the line.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; The point of no return. You cannot
[1:19:47] separate the message from me. Why?
[1:19:49] Because I've become one with it.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; So when you say he's wrong, you're
[1:19:54] saying I'm wrong.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; And I'm never wrong.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[1:20:07] I'm not always right, but I'm never
[1:20:09] wrong.
[1:20:11] No, I want to make you smile and laugh
[1:20:14] at times because otherwise I could screw
[1:20:17] this thing down and make it so tight
[1:20:20] that you know, hey,
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; We could make it to where nobody's going
[1:20:24] to make it.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came the first time, they
[1:20:34] missed his coming.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. the religious they were
[1:20:38] looking for a king and God sent him a
[1:20:40] baby right
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; sers we would see Jesus in 1957 look at
[1:20:45] Simeon in the temple that morning when
[1:20:47] he was promised by the Holy Spirit that
[1:20:49] he would not see death till he had seen
[1:20:51] the Lord's Christ
[1:20:54] came right out in the temple led by the
[1:20:57] Holy Spirit right straight to that
[1:20:59] little virgin standing there with a baby
[1:21:01] in her arms wrapped in swaddling cloth
[1:21:04] and picked that little baby up in his
[1:21:06] arms and said, "Lord, let thy servant
[1:21:08] depart in peace according to thy word,
[1:21:11] for mine eyes have seen thy salvation."
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Look at old blind Anne, Anna in the
[1:21:19] temple, a prophetus, waited for the
[1:21:22] consolation of Israel, and she served
[1:21:23] the Lord day and night in the temple by
[1:21:26] fasting and praying. and she and and
[1:21:29] being spirit led, she comes by the Holy
[1:21:32] Spirit, blind, right, straight and
[1:21:34] picked up that baby and prophesied over
[1:21:36] him and for those who waited for the
[1:21:39] consolation of Israel.
[1:21:41] So now God can fulfill his word and some
[1:21:44] see it and others miss it.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; So I want to I want you to see how that
[1:21:50] the disciples,
[1:21:52] somebody say disciples,
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; they missed the coming of John.
[1:21:58] They're following Jesus.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. Turn with me if you would into
[1:22:02] Matthew 17 verses 10 through13. And his
[1:22:06] disciples asked him, saying, "Why then
[1:22:10] say the scribes that Elias must first
[1:22:13] come?" Now notice how Jesus answers
[1:22:16] their question. I thought Elias
[1:22:20] is going to come first. I thought there
[1:22:21] was going to be a messenger. Is there
[1:22:23] going to be a forerunner?
[1:22:26] And Jesus answered and said unto them,
[1:22:28] Elias truly shall first come. That
[1:22:31] sounds future tense.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Elias shall f surely first come. Sounds
[1:22:37] future. And restore all things. Yes.
[1:22:41] See, I tell you, it's still future.
[1:22:43] Well, keep reading.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; And I say unto you that Elias has come
[1:22:48] already.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; What? I imagine their jaws went.
[1:22:54] He did
[1:22:57] like our little grandson Liam. He he
[1:23:00] asked
[1:23:01] his grandma one day, "Grandma, are you
[1:23:03] ever going to get married?"
[1:23:07] She said, "What, Liam? I'm already
[1:23:10] married." And he in his little little
[1:23:13] mind, he said to her, "You are."
[1:23:17] And he, "Yeah, well, who did you marry?"
[1:23:20] Oah. Oah. I thought he was your father
[1:23:25] because she calls me dad.
[1:23:31] You see sometimes when you're a child
[1:23:33] you think as a child but is you know he
[1:23:36] had this real quizzical look. You are
[1:23:41] to who?
[1:23:43] that old man you call dad
[1:23:47] that Elias has come already and they
[1:23:51] knew him not
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; and have done unto him whatsoever they
[1:23:56] listed. When you research that out they
[1:23:59] say all manner of evil against him and
[1:24:02] they did what they wanted to do with his
[1:24:05] ministry.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Likewise shall also the son of man
[1:24:10] suffer of them.
[1:24:12] Then the disciples understood. Then
[1:24:16] praise God. Woo!
[1:24:19] Flash
[1:24:21] beeping.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Revelation.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[1:24:30] Then they understood. He spake of John
[1:24:34] the Baptist.
[1:24:37] Listen carefully. Now, I'm trying to
[1:24:39] bring this to a close and I'm not even
[1:24:42] I'm I'm going to hurry hurry. I may I
[1:24:44] may pass up some stuff. Although both
[1:24:46] will f
[1:24:48] false and true virgin and I call the
[1:24:51] false virgin. She's true virgin. She is
[1:24:54] a virgin material, but let's call wise
[1:24:57] and foolish. That's better wording
[1:24:58] because that's scriptural wording.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; So, both wise and foolish are wakened by
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; the shout. at the midnight hour.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; And both foolish and wise awakened. The
[1:25:15] the voice said, "Uh, go ye out to meet
[1:25:19] him. Trim your lamps." And it was at
[1:25:22] that time that the foolish realized they
[1:25:27] don't have oil.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:25:31] I pray there not be one in this church.
[1:25:34] Amen.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; That everyone will be ready and their
[1:25:38] lamps filled with oil.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Because at that time,
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; and the scripture says, "And those that
[1:25:45] had oil went in
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; and the others were cast out where
[1:25:49] there's weeping and wailing and nashing
[1:25:50] of teeth.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; If I would have only
[1:25:54] if I'd have been a little more serious
[1:25:56] about it."
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; This is a very serious thing.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:26:06] It'll only be the Holy Ghost filled that
[1:26:09] go in the rapture.
[1:26:12] Those that have the token.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; How dare you cheapen the token by saying
[1:26:23] something like, "Well,
[1:26:26] whoever loved him and whoever
[1:26:29] he loved is going to be there, and you
[1:26:31] don't live the word." That's nonsense.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Because love
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; is going Jesus said if you love me,
[1:26:43] you keep my commandments.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Don't say you love him and then live any
[1:26:47] kind of life you want to.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. And so it'll only be the Holy
[1:26:55] Ghost filled bride members that will go
[1:26:57] in the rapture. Only the Holy Ghost fil
[1:27:00] bride will be in the new Jerusalem.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; What about Hatty Wright's kids?
[1:27:11] Are they bride?
[1:27:15] I'm I I want to provoke you. I wanted to
[1:27:17] get you to thinking, wait a sec,
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Hattie. Hatty, right? Yeah. Yeah. Hadty,
[1:27:22] right? What do you want? I want the
[1:27:24] salvation
[1:27:26] of my two boys. Straight way they come
[1:27:28] through the door crying, got down,
[1:27:30] cried, gave their heart to the Lord.
[1:27:32] Where are they today?
[1:27:34] Are they going into church? Did they say
[1:27:36] they believe this message?
[1:27:40] Come on, man. Do your homework.
[1:27:45] Find out. You You Well, no. In fact,
[1:27:48] there's all kinds of different things
[1:27:50] like that. Now, does that stumble me?
[1:27:52] But but no. Hey, you know what? The
[1:27:54] prophet said they're going to be saved
[1:27:56] and gave them to Hattie. Right. She as a
[1:27:58] mother claimed the promise that they're
[1:28:00] going to be saved, but that doesn't make
[1:28:01] them bride.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Because if they're bride,
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; they'll follow the word. Why? They got
[1:28:08] the oil.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; They got the Isaf. They got the
[1:28:12] understanding.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; So, there's a vast difference between
[1:28:17] being saved and sealed. Amen.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Not just born again,
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; but adopted.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Many are called,
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; but few are chosen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Make your calling and your election.
[1:28:34] Sure.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; It's not well, I'm called. Praise the
[1:28:38] Lord. In the message, got a message,
[1:28:41] family. My pastor believes a message. He
[1:28:43] preached about it. We're all going.
[1:28:45] That's it. I'm part of it. You're just
[1:28:47] caught up in the vortex.
[1:28:50] You're kind of swept up along with the
[1:28:52] movement. I want to ask, is the message
[1:28:54] in you?
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Full obedience
[1:29:00] to the word of God entitles you to the
[1:29:02] token.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Now, take the next couple verses or
[1:29:07] sentences. And disobedience
[1:29:10] to any of that nullifies the whole
[1:29:13] promise.
[1:29:16] Full obedience entitles you to the
[1:29:20] token. Disobedience of any of it
[1:29:24] nullifies the whole thing.
[1:29:32] Okay.
[1:29:34] Now,
[1:29:36] Malachi 4 says,
[1:29:40] Malachi 3 said, "My messenger shall
[1:29:42] prepare the way." The way when you look
[1:29:45] it up, it means a course of life, a mode
[1:29:48] of action or a manner of life.
[1:29:51] This
[1:29:54] my messenger is going to prepare the
[1:29:56] way.
[1:29:58] Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth,
[1:30:01] and the life. No man comes to the father
[1:30:05] but by me. There is only one way."
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this messenger came to prepare
[1:30:12] that way.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Why? Not like denominations said. Well,
[1:30:17] he, you know, it really doesn't matter.
[1:30:19] And God is the center of the spoke wheel
[1:30:22] and all the spokes. It doesn't matter
[1:30:24] what religion, Baptist, uh, Methodists,
[1:30:27] Presbyterian, Buddha, Confucious, it
[1:30:30] doesn't matter. And in the center, the
[1:30:32] hub is God. And we all get there. And
[1:30:34] then, no, Jesus said, "I am the way.
[1:30:37] Right?
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; I am the manner of life.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; There is no life outside of Jesus Christ
[1:30:46] because he that hath the son
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; hath life and he that hath not the son
[1:30:52] hath not life. No man comes to the
[1:30:54] father but by me.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; So the revelation of Jesus Christ is
[1:31:00] what God is making himself known from
[1:31:03] Genesis to Revelation.
[1:31:06] The whole Bible is God making himself
[1:31:09] known
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; because Christ, that anointing is the
[1:31:14] mystery of God
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; revealed.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Okay, this is good. You guys are
[1:31:23] listening. You don't have to be shouting
[1:31:24] and jumping and I want you to listen.
[1:31:26] It's good.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. And sometimes as I preach, I I let
[1:31:32] you kind of finish the sentence before I
[1:31:34] do because I want to see, are you
[1:31:36] reading your Bible? Are you sitting
[1:31:38] there looking at me like a a cow at a
[1:31:41] new gate?
[1:31:46] Got no idea what he talking about.
[1:31:51] Well, you ain't reading.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; You don't know the open book.
[1:31:57] I need you listen those that have known
[1:32:01] my ministry since I started ministrying
[1:32:04] many years ago. I have always said this.
[1:32:07] Do your homework.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; I want all of you do your homework. That
[1:32:14] means pray, read, listen to these tapes.
[1:32:17] Don't let me be the the high priest and
[1:32:21] the one who tells you and you listen to
[1:32:23] the way that I tell you because you know
[1:32:26] I I'm the one and I'm God's ordained.
[1:32:28] Hey, you know what? I might be a false
[1:32:30] prophet.
[1:32:32] I don't believe I am.
[1:32:35] But you know what? There's a lot of out
[1:32:37] there claiming
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; that they're the right. And by the word,
[1:32:43] you give them the word test,
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:46] If you don't know the word, how do you
[1:32:48] test them?
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; By the signs and wonders? No. Wrong
[1:32:52] answer.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Failed.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; By the anointing, wrong. They're both
[1:32:58] anointed.
[1:33:00] Then how do you tell the the right from
[1:33:02] the wrong? Take it back to the word.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Because the word of God, listen to this.
[1:33:08] The word of God is our thumb.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; It is our absolute. Because if this
[1:33:13] prophet came and started preaching
[1:33:15] something that wasn't in the word,
[1:33:17] brother Brennham said, "You can call me
[1:33:19] a false prophet."
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Why, brother Brennham, what you're
[1:33:23] preaching, I think, is the 22nd book of
[1:33:26] whatever I think Revelations or Acts or
[1:33:28] whatever it was. And he says, "Well,
[1:33:30] brother, as good as that sounds, we
[1:33:33] realize we're a continuation of the Holy
[1:33:35] Spirit." But he said, "If I were to add
[1:33:38] more to the word, I would be a false
[1:33:40] prophet."
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. The apostle Paul said, "Let every
[1:33:43] man take heed how he builds on this
[1:33:46] foundation.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; I and I alone am the wise master
[1:33:49] builder. Let everyone admit
[1:33:53] because if they don't, let him be a
[1:33:55] nanma marinatha. Let him be accursed at
[1:33:59] his coming." Why? Because I'm laying a
[1:34:01] foundation.
[1:34:04] And if I came and though an angel came
[1:34:07] down from heaven or I came and tried to
[1:34:09] change what I've already said is thus
[1:34:11] sayeth the Lord,
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; he said false prophet.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; We were listening to tape the other day.
[1:34:23] This is this just came to my mind. And
[1:34:26] brother Brennan, there was a a doctor
[1:34:31] who said, "This man, he's got a very bad
[1:34:34] disease and he'll be dead within two or
[1:34:36] three days." Brother Bram said, "No,
[1:34:39] I've seen a vision and he's going to
[1:34:41] he's God's going to raise him up." He
[1:34:43] said, "No, all of our medical science
[1:34:47] said, hey, I'm sorry, guy. You and your
[1:34:50] little spiritual revelation, this guy's
[1:34:54] dying." Okay. And according to his
[1:34:58] scientific knowledge and medical
[1:35:00] understanding, he is dying.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; But now the prophets got a word of the
[1:35:05] Lord and said, "No, God's going to raise
[1:35:07] him up."
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; And brother Brennan made a a statement.
[1:35:10] He said, "I'll tell you what, let's do
[1:35:12] this. If in three days this man is not
[1:35:15] raised up and back in natural health, I
[1:35:18] will put a sign on my back. I'm a false
[1:35:21] prophet and you can run me down the city
[1:35:23] and honk your horn and put a sign I'm a
[1:35:26] false prophet and said, "Now, if in
[1:35:29] three days
[1:35:31] he is raised up, can I put a sign on
[1:35:34] your back that you're a a quack doctor?"
[1:35:40] Hey, I don't want no part of this deal.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Hey, you talk about the spirit of
[1:35:45] Elijah.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; You bunch of false hypocrite.
[1:35:51] You want to say, you know, well then you
[1:35:53] you can if God don't raise him up in
[1:35:56] three days, I'm a false prophet. And
[1:35:59] said, but if he does raise him up,
[1:36:01] you're a quack doctor.
[1:36:04] I love it.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:36:16] The ark was God's provided place. Noah
[1:36:18] was God's provided preacher.
[1:36:21] His message became God's provided way.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Can we agree on that? Noah's family were
[1:36:27] the provided people because he could
[1:36:30] only
[1:36:31] he could only persuade his own family.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; 120 years of preaching and he was a good
[1:36:38] preacher.
[1:36:39] He could Hey, let me tell you. It's a
[1:36:41] family affair. Shh, don't tell me it's
[1:36:44] rigged.
[1:36:47] Only family is going to believe it
[1:36:48] because if they're not part of the
[1:36:50] family of God, guess what? Right over
[1:36:52] their head.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Okay? They're gonna miss it. But if they
[1:36:55] are part of the family, listen, you
[1:36:57] might run from this and you might not
[1:36:59] see it clearly and you might have a
[1:37:01] little hard time uh understanding it.
[1:37:04] But just hang on.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, this thing's going to
[1:37:08] slap you upside one day. The light's
[1:37:10] going to turn on and you're going to go,
[1:37:12] "Oh,
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; bing. light turns on.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm going to use Matthew 24 very
[1:37:24] quickly in the scripture. Matthew
[1:37:26] 24:37-4.
[1:37:29] But as in the days of Noah, so shall
[1:37:31] also the coming of the son of man be. So
[1:37:34] as it was in the days of Noah, so shall
[1:37:36] here's the type
[1:37:38] days in the before the flood, they were
[1:37:40] eating and drinking, marrying, giving
[1:37:42] and marriage until the day that Noah
[1:37:44] entered into the ark. sold. Nothing
[1:37:46] wrong with marrying, giving in marriage,
[1:37:48] eating, drinking. Nothing wrong with
[1:37:50] that. We've all done it. People are
[1:37:53] getting married in marriage. But now
[1:37:56] watch this. And they knew not verse 39
[1:37:59] until the flood came and took them all
[1:38:00] away. So
[1:38:03] it wasn't until judgment struck them and
[1:38:08] they were taken away realized, man,
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; he was right.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:16] Now watch. Then two shall be in the
[1:38:19] field. The one shall be taken, the other
[1:38:21] left. Two women shall be grinding at the
[1:38:23] mill. One shall be taken and the other
[1:38:25] left. Watch therefore, for you know not
[1:38:27] what hour your Lord doth come. So if
[1:38:30] because the good men of the house, if he
[1:38:32] would have known, he would have been
[1:38:33] ready and wouldn't let it be broke up.
[1:38:35] Verse uh 44. Therefore be ye also ready.
[1:38:42] Hey saints, be ready.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; For in such an hour as you think not,
[1:38:48] the son of man cometh. Who then is a
[1:38:51] faithful and wise servant,
[1:38:53] whom his lord hath made ruler over his
[1:38:56] household to give them meat in due
[1:38:59] season. Now you know the direction I'm
[1:39:01] going to go Sunday morning.
[1:39:04] Spiritual food in due season.
[1:39:06] Who is a wise and faithful pastor,
[1:39:09] preacher, evangelist, teacher, five-fold
[1:39:12] ministry who is giving the people and
[1:39:15] provoking them to get into spiritual
[1:39:18] food in due season.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, no, just believe me. I'm the
[1:39:24] one God sent. You just come here, pay me
[1:39:26] your tithes, and you know, we come and
[1:39:29] uh you know, I'll I'll I'll do it for
[1:39:31] you. I'll do your reading and I'll do
[1:39:32] your praying. No, I am not your kind old
[1:39:34] priest. Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Do your homework.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay.
[1:39:43] Now,
[1:39:45] uh Okay, I've got to pass up some of
[1:39:47] this here.
[1:39:49] So,
[1:39:52] I'm going to close here and say this.
[1:39:54] The messenger came to prepare the way.
[1:39:56] Prepared your thinking. He prayed
[1:39:58] prepared your manner of life. And if he
[1:40:01] did not adjust your manner of life,
[1:40:03] there's something wrong.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; let's just be honest with one another.
[1:40:08] If your life is not being changed and
[1:40:10] affected by the ministry of Malachi 4,
[1:40:15] then you're just sucked along with some
[1:40:18] kind of movement
[1:40:20] and it's not revealed to you. Now, uh,
[1:40:24] brother Bram says, "Present stage of my
[1:40:26] ministry.
[1:40:27] letter comes uh all the time. One come
[1:40:31] the other day said, "Brother Brennan, I
[1:40:33] had the greatest of confidence in you,
[1:40:35] but I heard you say a certain
[1:40:36] denomination which I belong to was
[1:40:38] backsliding."
[1:40:41] Said, "I have no more confidence in you
[1:40:43] at all." Now, from now on, said there's
[1:40:46] about 25 of the brethren of my
[1:40:48] denomination sitting in one of your
[1:40:51] meetings and said, "Well, we just got
[1:40:52] right up and went off when you said
[1:40:54] that."
[1:40:57] They did it to him. They'll do it to us.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to make everybody Hey,
[1:41:03] uh, we're all going. No,
[1:41:07] do your homework. Find out. I want you
[1:41:10] to you to answer your own questions.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, all men hath forsaken me.
[1:41:17] But there's one thing. He stood by me.
[1:41:20] One thing. I wasn't disobedient to the
[1:41:22] heavenly vision. What happened down
[1:41:23] there on the river? I've stayed true to
[1:41:25] it. He's been true to me. I'm trusting
[1:41:28] in him someday. I don't know when, for a
[1:41:31] crowning of my ministry. What do you
[1:41:33] mean crowning of your ministry?
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; When he's ready. I am. Now, look here. I
[1:41:38] hope he'll crown my ministry with this
[1:41:42] of letting me take the clothes of the
[1:41:44] word
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; and dress his bride in the clothes of
[1:41:48] the word and for his righteousness.
[1:41:57] Dress me, Lord.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Take the word of God
[1:42:05] and cover me.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:12] In God keeps his word 1957.
[1:42:17] Now, if you'll notice, he said, "As it
[1:42:18] was in the days of Noah, the days of
[1:42:21] Noah before the flood, how it would be,
[1:42:23] and God was not willing that any should
[1:42:25] perish, but all might come to
[1:42:27] repentance." Then he suffered long. The
[1:42:30] flood stage was way past due down in
[1:42:33] Egypt. It was way past due. Did you get
[1:42:36] it? In the end of the destruction now,
[1:42:39] way past due, the destruction and
[1:42:41] judgment and coming out of Egypt was
[1:42:44] passed due. 40 years over time. And God
[1:42:47] was determined,
[1:42:49] determined that his word would not
[1:42:51] return to him. He was going to keep his
[1:42:53] word. He's going to keep his word. He
[1:42:55] must do it in order to be God. If he has
[1:42:58] to make a change of everything and by
[1:43:00] grace he will do it, that's the reason I
[1:43:02] say if the church does not get herself
[1:43:05] ready, that's your duty to get ready.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; The bride has made herself ready.
[1:43:13] The garments is paid for.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; They are ready. But yet, you must be
[1:43:19] ready to wear those garments.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; The church has made herself ready.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, are you taking this
[1:43:26] message and say, "Dress me, Lord."
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Is your dress conducive
[1:43:32] to the Holy Spirit showing you modesty
[1:43:36] in modest apparel? Not just a dress, a
[1:43:39] modest dress.
[1:43:44] You understand?
[1:43:53] Let me say this. As the Holy Spirit
[1:43:58] begins to quicken this bride
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; to this message, which is the word
[1:44:04] revealed in its season,
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; will she get more holy?
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:11] Will you be able to see in her walk and
[1:44:14] her manner of speech and the way she
[1:44:16] dresses
[1:44:18] that she's putting away the fashions of
[1:44:20] mystery Babylon,
[1:44:22] Babylonian garments, and you might have
[1:44:25] a long dress on, but what if it's got a
[1:44:27] slit that comes way up to your thigh?
[1:44:32] What if you trim your hair just a little
[1:44:34] bit? Because if a woman trims her hair,
[1:44:37] let her be short.
[1:44:46] And he says, "And when a woman cuts her
[1:44:48] hair, it's a seducing spirit. It's an
[1:44:52] enticing spirit." And he says, "And you
[1:44:55] dishonor your head because it was given
[1:44:58] to you for power because of the angels."
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Sisters,
[1:45:04] protect what you got.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; God's given it to you as a covering.
[1:45:09] My wife one time just after she come
[1:45:11] into the message and she doesn't like me
[1:45:13] to use her as an example but maybe I
[1:45:16] should use your wife as an example
[1:45:19] but she went she went to oh to we it was
[1:45:22] way back when you had to light the stove
[1:45:23] you remember you turn on the gas you
[1:45:26] light the match you reach in and you
[1:45:28] turn it on well she turns the gas on the
[1:45:31] stove puts it down lights a match and it
[1:45:34] goes out she lights another match it
[1:45:36] goes out finally lights f now It's been
[1:45:38] on for five, 10 seconds, right? So now
[1:45:40] you put in
[1:45:43] flash.
[1:45:45] You know what she said? My glory.
[1:45:49] My glory.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; She wipes her eyebrow. It's gone.
[1:45:55] Her hair just all singed. You know what?
[1:45:58] She was worried about my glory.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't uh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[1:46:03] oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[1:46:03] oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[1:46:03] oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I'm going to be
[1:46:04] disfigured or anything like this and oh
[1:46:08] oh if if we had
[1:46:11] this kind of sensitivity to our sisters
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says I want you to look
[1:46:17] nice but not too nice. Don't take your
[1:46:19] beauty out of Hollywood because the
[1:46:22] Bible says beauty is deceptive.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; He said take your beauty out of the
[1:46:28] word.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. of a quiet and gentle spirit.
[1:46:34] My Okay.
[1:46:40] Sudden secret catching away.
[1:46:45] Oh, wait. No, no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This
[1:46:47] is it. 1958, paragraph 28. Some people
[1:46:51] say, "Well, I go to church on Sunday
[1:46:53] morning." That's good. I listen to our
[1:46:56] pastor. That's good. Which is a fine
[1:46:58] preacher. I hope so. That's good. I
[1:47:01] appreciate that in you or America, the
[1:47:03] world, whoever it is. But it takes more
[1:47:06] than a good message from the pulpit.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; It takes your life.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; It takes you to get ready.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:47:15] In Revelations the 19th chapter, the 7th
[1:47:18] verse, the Bible said that speaking of
[1:47:21] the bride of Christ, she has made
[1:47:23] herself ready. She made herself ready.
[1:47:26] And you as a member of this bride,
[1:47:28] you've got to make yourself ready.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Musicians, come. I'm on overtime right
[1:47:34] now.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet said, "There was a
[1:47:41] time when we used to tell you you had to
[1:47:43] be prayed up every month."
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then the time come, you had to
[1:47:48] be prayed up every week."
[1:47:52] And he said then the time come you need
[1:47:54] to be prayed up every hour.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; He said actually every day then every
[1:48:00] hour
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; because even the Apostle Paul says I
[1:48:04] pray without ceasing.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; I don't know about any of you but
[1:48:10] many times I'm praying throughout the
[1:48:11] day and I'm just asking God for help.
[1:48:15] Amen.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Situation dries up and you know I don't
[1:48:20] stop. Oh my heavenly father, the God in
[1:48:23] heaven whom I love. No, I I just am Lord
[1:48:26] I I need your help. Lord
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; I'm having an issue here and I don't
[1:48:32] really realize but my subconscious
[1:48:36] is praying without ceasing. I don't even
[1:48:38] have to say amen.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Why? because I continue throughout the
[1:48:45] day relationship.
[1:48:50] Paragraph 33, same sermon, sudden secret
[1:48:52] going away of the church.
[1:48:55] Some time ago, a story just before
[1:48:57] closing that struck me as I heard it
[1:49:01] many, many years ago. That secret coming
[1:49:04] of the Lord, sudden secret going of the
[1:49:06] church. Wait, it'll be two in a field.
[1:49:10] I'll take one and leave one. There'll be
[1:49:12] two in the bed. I'll take one and leave
[1:49:14] one. Showing that the coming of the Lord
[1:49:17] will not be just any certain corner, but
[1:49:20] it'll be universal.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; One will be in the field working
[1:49:25] daytime, the other in the bed sleeping
[1:49:28] on the other side of the world.
[1:49:31] It'll be a universal rapture.
[1:49:35] Listen, nobody has exclusive right to
[1:49:38] say you got to follow this guy, this
[1:49:42] church, or you're not going to be in it.
[1:49:47] Do we know anybody within the message
[1:49:50] that claims if you don't follow them,
[1:49:52] you're not going to make it? Listen,
[1:49:54] that's already earmarked their false
[1:49:56] prophet.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Mark it down,
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; okay? Because it's going to be
[1:50:02] universal.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's not going to be a certain
[1:50:04] preacher. It's not going to be a certain
[1:50:06] church location. It's going to be people
[1:50:09] that are following the Holy Spirit in
[1:50:12] this day.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; It'll be a universal rapture. It'll come
[1:50:16] with a shout, with the voice of the
[1:50:17] archangel, and the trump of God shall
[1:50:19] sound, and the dead in Christ shall
[1:50:21] rise, and she will be caught away
[1:50:23] secret. Oh, I love that. the bridegroom
[1:50:25] coming. And the bride got herself ready,
[1:50:28] waiting for that secret moment that she
[1:50:31] doesn't even know herself, but she's
[1:50:33] ready and dressed and waiting for it.
[1:50:37] For the lamb's wife
[1:50:43] has made herself ready.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:48] I'm asking you,
[1:50:50] do you judge yourself or are you judging
[1:50:53] others? Or do you judge your servitude
[1:50:56] towards God by looking at others who are
[1:50:59] less than you? I'm glad I'm not as this
[1:51:03] guy. He don't even come to church on
[1:51:06] Wednesday. He don't come to church on,
[1:51:09] you know, we see him once every two or
[1:51:11] three months.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm not like that guy.
[1:51:16] Well, remember as you meet others, it's
[1:51:19] going to be meant to you.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Let's judge yourselves.
[1:51:24] [Music]
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; You point your hand out there with a
[1:51:27] finger at somebody, you got three
[1:51:28] pointing back at you.
[1:51:31] Let me not be a phariseical
[1:51:35] believer in this end time.
[1:51:38] Let me not be an actor of this message.
[1:51:42] [Music]
[1:51:44] Let me be a true believer.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Let me love God with all my heart.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just know what's right
[1:51:52] to do and then I don't do it.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Because what good is it to see yourself
[1:51:57] in the mirror of the word and
[1:52:00] straightway you go and forget what
[1:52:02] manner of man you are.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us. Huh?
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; That's why saints of God, this is a
[1:52:09] Wednesday night. Thank God for Wednesday
[1:52:11] nights. And I thank God for every one of
[1:52:13] you. Yes, I would love to have the
[1:52:15] church as full on Wednesday night as it
[1:52:18] is on Sunday morning, but that's just
[1:52:21] not going to happen. Many are working.
[1:52:23] Many it's so far for them to travel and
[1:52:27] everything. I understand it. So, I will
[1:52:30] say to you that are here tonight,
[1:52:35] I honor you that you are here.
[1:52:40] We're not going to put down the others
[1:52:41] that are not here because it may be a
[1:52:44] legitimate excuse.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; But I honor you because here on a
[1:52:49] Wednesday night, you might have had a
[1:52:51] rough day. You might have been busy. You
[1:52:55] might have had all hell break loose in
[1:52:58] your day. And you just h I got home and
[1:53:02] my job and the people and the traffic
[1:53:06] and my kids and my wife and my dog and
[1:53:10] my bank account and
[1:53:14] you ever had one of them days everything
[1:53:16] just falls apart.
[1:53:18] Well,
[1:53:20] it's okay. It's good for you. Life is
[1:53:23] not a bed of roses.
[1:53:27] Life is trials,
[1:53:30] tribulations,
[1:53:32] testings.
[1:53:34] Brother Brim said, "There will not be a
[1:53:36] son or daughter of God that makes it to
[1:53:39] heaven except that they went through the
[1:53:42] trials and the testings." And sometimes
[1:53:45] God is going to test you by looking like
[1:53:48] he forgot you. He didn't answer your
[1:53:51] prayer because he wants to see your
[1:53:54] reaction to his action.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Well, if that's the way
[1:54:00] he's going to be,
[1:54:04] I prayed last night
[1:54:07] and I didn't get the job offer today.
[1:54:13] If that's the way God is because he told
[1:54:16] me, if you say anything in my name, I'll
[1:54:18] give it to you. I did. I said it in your
[1:54:20] name, Lord. I said it.
[1:54:24] How many people are that way with God?
[1:54:27] Sometimes he holds it back.
[1:54:32] He wants to see what kind of reaction
[1:54:33] you're going to get.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Well, if that's the way he is,
[1:54:40] God don't owe any of us an answer on
[1:54:42] anything.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham got mad at God one
[1:54:47] time. He said, "God, you owe me an
[1:54:49] answer."
[1:54:51] He says for about six months he said I
[1:54:55] didn't feel his presence.
[1:54:57] He didn't come by.
[1:54:59] And finally he he recognized that he had
[1:55:03] said something that wasn't pleasing to
[1:55:05] God. He said, "God, I'm sorry. You don't
[1:55:07] owe me nothing."
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; He says, "Then
[1:55:12] when his attitude got right and all of a
[1:55:14] sudden he said, then Holy Spirit said,
[1:55:16] "You remember that girl you prayed for?"
[1:55:18] and on and on told him.
[1:55:23] [Music]
[1:55:32] It was a tiny simple stable
[1:55:38] allbe
[1:55:42] [Music]
[1:55:48] for a king to be born.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Little bit faster now. Choose some place
[1:55:56] special
[1:55:58] to reveal his majesty.
[1:56:03] So I know if I give him control that
[1:56:08] he'll be born in me.
[1:56:13] Let your word
[1:56:17] be born
[1:56:19] in the manger of my heart.
[1:56:25] Let it live with me.
[1:56:29] There is God
[1:56:30] [Music]
[1:56:33] living inside this house of
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; and mold it every day.
[1:56:44] Let your word be born
[1:56:48] in the manger
[1:56:51] of my heart.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Outwardly I'm nothing.
[1:56:57] [Music]
[1:56:58] Outwardly
[1:57:00] nothing,
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; not much to behold,
[1:57:07] unlikely
[1:57:09] a place
[1:57:11] for his worth.
[1:57:16] But if I just my vessel
[1:57:21] and let him have his way
[1:57:26] [Music]
[1:57:30] to change me
[1:57:32] [Music]
[1:57:38] [Music]
[1:57:41] in the manger of my
[1:57:47] Let it live in me.
[1:57:50] Let it
[1:57:55] live inside this house and clay
[1:58:00] and mold it every day.
[1:58:05] Let your word be born
[1:58:09] in the manger
[1:58:12] of my heart.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[1:58:18] thank you.
[1:58:20] Thank you for your Holy Spirit.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the correction of the
[1:58:26] word.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father, that you told us that
[1:58:32] the bride would make herself ready.
[1:58:34] Therefore, Father, it's not upon the
[1:58:37] preacher.
[1:58:38] It's not upon the prophet or the church.
[1:58:42] It depends on us.
[1:58:45] Each one personal. I put it back on
[1:58:47] everyone who is here tonight. Whether it
[1:58:50] be the seen audience or the unseen, it's
[1:58:53] up to you.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you're not doing like you
[1:58:57] should do,
[1:59:00] would you humble yourself and say,
[1:59:02] "Father,
[1:59:04] help me to be better.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Help me to be obedient.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; I've been a little slack. I've been a
[1:59:12] Yeah, I haven't done what I should do.
[1:59:16] Therefore, Father,
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; I pray,
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; be patient with me, Lord,
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; because I'm human and humans, we make
[1:59:26] mistakes. And
[1:59:29] oh, Lord, I can't wait for the day when
[1:59:31] I'm totally changed.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And until that day, Father,
[1:59:35] we're going to have
[1:59:37] we're going to have ups and downs and
[1:59:39] trials and testings.
[1:59:42] But Father, in the end,
[1:59:45] if our spirit is right and our heart is
[1:59:48] right
[1:59:49] and we're prepared at your coming.
[1:59:53] Because if we're not prepared,
[1:59:56] comes a disaster. If a nation is not
[1:59:58] prepared for war,
[2:00:01] then shall come sudden destruction.
[2:00:05] If the people are not prepared for your
[2:00:08] coming, they're going to miss it.
[2:00:12] Therefore, Father, I pray each one may
[2:00:15] say within their heart right now,
[2:00:18] judging themsel, help me to prepare
[2:00:22] myself. Let me take the responsibility
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; on the way I live and the things that I
[2:00:29] do.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; I pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:38] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank you for
[2:00:41] coming to the house of the Lord tonight
[2:00:43] to be here. It's 9:29. It's almost 9:30.
[2:00:47] And I realize on Wednesday nights, uh, I
[2:00:51] know many of you drive long ways, okay?
[2:00:55] Sister Lynn Merchant, she comes all the
[2:00:57] way from Maricopa,
[2:00:59] hour and 45 minutes, and she drives
[2:01:01] alone.
[2:01:03] [Music]
[2:01:04] There are people, you know, and then
[2:01:06] there are some people that listen, if we
[2:01:09] go into overtime, ah, I got to go to
[2:01:12] work. Who doesn't?
[2:01:14] Who's not too busy?
[2:01:18] We're all busy. You've all got jobs. You
[2:01:21] all got things to do. You've all got f
[2:01:24] Now, you're not all married and
[2:01:26] everything, but those of you that do,
[2:01:27] you got a wife and family and kids and a
[2:01:30] mortgage and a house payment and a car
[2:01:32] payment. I got to pay gas.
[2:01:36] Yeah, I realize all those things. But
[2:01:38] sometimes we go into overtime.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; It's good for you. Sometimes you
[2:01:42] sometimes your boss will make you stay
[2:01:45] and you have to work overtime. Are you
[2:01:47] going to get in his face and say, "I'll
[2:01:49] tell you what, you got no right to hire
[2:01:51] me overtime. I won't go home." Well,
[2:01:53] I'll tell you what, you'll probably get
[2:01:54] a paycheck the next week and say,
[2:01:56] "Adios, amigo."
[2:01:59] Okay?
[2:02:00] Because there are some times that you
[2:02:02] you got to work overtime.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; And there are some times when the
[2:02:05] preacher goes into overtime.
[2:02:09] Do you think if he holds you a little
[2:02:11] bit and I'm not going to hold you any
[2:02:12] longer
[2:02:15] and you said, "Lord,
[2:02:18] I'm so tired. I'd like to go home, but
[2:02:21] out of respect to you and your word, I'm
[2:02:25] going to stay here and I'm going to wait
[2:02:28] and I'm going to take a moment.
[2:02:30] I'm not going to be so worried about my
[2:02:32] job and whether I get the sleep or
[2:02:34] something because most of the time
[2:02:36] you're not sleeping when you should
[2:02:38] sleep because you'll go home, you'll get
[2:02:39] on your iPad, you'll this and that,
[2:02:41] you'll Facebook, you'll get Instagram
[2:02:44] and and you'll spend all that time when
[2:02:46] you could have given God
[2:02:49] not so quick to
[2:02:52] Okay, I love you guys.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Love you, brother.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you truth.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, God bless you. Wednesday
[2:03:01] night, I'm going to dismiss you. We're
[2:03:03] not going to sing any more songs. We've
[2:03:04] sung enough. You've heard the word. How
[2:03:06] many say amen to that?
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Shake one another's
[2:03:10] hand and say, "God bless you. I'll see
[2:03:12] you Sunday."
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; You are dismissed in the name of the
[2:03:15] Lord.
[2:03:17] Drive careful.
[2:03:21] [Music]
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:28] [Music]
[2:04:14] Oh,
[2:04:17] you
