Let's stand this morning. Pastor be speaking for us today. You that have been traveling, we welcome you back. Hopefully, you had a great time. And it's good to see so many visitors out to the house of the Lord today. I'm casting all my cares on you because he cares for you and I this morning. casting all my cares on him this morning. So I'm casting all my cares [music] on [singing] you. I know you love [music and singing] me. Redemption in my blood. Oh, that's [music and singing] the greatest story and restoration for redemption.

I believe that. [applause] I believe that with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. Thank you musicians. God bless you. Certainly is a grand privilege to be in the house of the Lord once again. &gt;&gt; Amen. To share with you the word of God and to just enjoy God's presence together. This is the first Sunday of the new year. And I think that's a good way to start the year, not only on our watch night service. In fact, uh those of you that missed our watch night service, we had a really tremendous time. Um, and uh, certainly always appreciate when you feel the presence of God, when he comes by in such a special way. He doesn't have to, &gt;&gt; but he did, &gt;&gt; and we're always thankful. Amen. Um, enjoyed the song specials this morning. He certainly is the not only the God on the mountain, but he's the God in the valley. And that song becomes a reality when you've gone through some valleys &gt;&gt; and you go through something and you don't feel his presence and he feels distant and you feel isolated but he says I will be with you &gt;&gt; even in you until the end of the world. And so uh we just take uh victory in that. You can be seated for just a moment. For just a moment, brother Mario, I would like you to come up here. My brother, he is going to be taking a missionary trip here. I believe on the 7th. And I'd like our minister brethren, brother Freddy, uh brother Steven, the different ones that are here uh at this church. and we're going to pray over him because he's going to be going uh on a missions trip. And I want you to just say where you're going, what you're going to be doing, and uh so that we can remember to pray for you because you're being sent out. And what a blessing because wherever you go, we go with you because our our blessings go with you. Brother Mario, God bless you. would you please tell us uh a little bit about what you're going to be doing on a missionary trip and when you're going and when you're coming back? &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. So, greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [clears throat] As I turn 67 last December 28th, uh God put it in my heart that uh if I spend the remaining years of my life serving the Lord maybe in the mission field. So, and we know it's not our desire to go by ourselves. We just need to be in the spirit of the Lord. So, it's my burden to go uh in the Philippines this coming year. So, I'll be going uh different places uh and uh the second week of uh January will be in Japan for their anniversary meeting maybe 5 days. and then going back to the Philippines. Then I'll be traveling to the southern part of uh the Philippines which is uh mostly on the Muslim side of uh the country. So I don't know how many days but as the Lord leads. So this is the first time I'd be visiting there cuz uh when I and brother Ron were in the Philippines uh there's a lot of uh ministers uh went there and attended the meetings and they are inviting brother Ron uh to come back and minister. So brother Ron always tell just tell brother Mario I will say [laughter] so so I have no choice but but as the Lord leads so we're happy to serve the Lord and maybe help elevate the faith of some of the brothers there in the Philippines. Thank you very much for all your prayers and thank you very much. &gt;&gt; Well, you just stay right here, brethren. Come. Let's lay our hands on him. We know that it's never easy as you go. We're not [clears throat] going just to put another stamp in the passport. You're not going somewhere just to eat their food or to experience another country, but you're actually go ye into all the world and preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; And that's a desire upon every heart. And God then starts dealing with your heart &gt;&gt; in a certain direction and you're already feeling that. &gt;&gt; And then as the invitations come in, then what we want to do is be faithful to stand behind you, help support you and and go. And so you give our love and greetings to all of those uh where you go and preach hell hot and heaven cool. &gt;&gt; Bring them into the presence of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let them know that they are chosen of God, but they must make their calling and election sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're going to lay our hands and you guys just pray with us. Heavenly Father, as we lay our hands upon our brother, even as they in the Old Testament when one was departing from their midst to go into a mission field, we know, Father, it's never easy to go because uh traveling is hard. uh sleeping in other places in other beds outside of our own comfort zone is never easy. But I pray father let &gt;&gt; the gift that you have placed within his life be used for the glory of your kingdom furthering father this gospel of the end time wherever he goes. We ask that you will bless his ministry. Bless those that hear it father. May he take them into a higher dimension, Father, which is only by faith of the Holy Spirit. So, Father, we lay our hands on him. We send him forth and ask that you will watch over him, Sister Josephine, and wherever they go. Keep them, Father, in the center of thy will. And keep them safe, I pray in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you, brother. Amen. Amen. Thank you, brother. Thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. All right, then let's get right into the service. Um, let's all stand together and let's turn. I'm going to continue on with this thought because even if those of you who were with us on watch night, I I just read our scriptures basically and just kind of got into it and all of a sudden the the Holy Spirit just comes down, takes you in a certain direction and and uh we thank God for that. But uh we're uh just going to have a a personal time with our church this morning and speak to you as a pastor. I've had some questions that have come up been asked to me and they were asked to me several weeks ago. And I said, "Well, I don't have time to maybe get into those, but I said you pray about it." And uh I I felt uh because it will help us launch off into our next service. Um so the Lord willing because I've been really very much um delving into the understanding of what is our placing as a bride in this hour. I want to know what is our responsibilities, what is our duties because we cannot activate promises of another age and claim it to be ours. But we must claim the promises that are made for the bride for this hour. That is our inheritance. And once you know your position, God then gives you power and authority. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's our desire. So, um, may the Lord bless you as we kind of take a little bit, answer some questions, and again, be patient with me this morning so that understanding that we may be laying a little bit of a foundation for [snorts] the next service or two. So, God bless you uh, all this morning as we read in the book of Ephesians, chapter 4, Ephesians 4, verses 1-6. And I am thankful for lost and found because these were lost and I found them 10 years ago. They've been on my desk in the back room and now I use them. Uh now I need them and so I use them. So whoever lost them, you can't claim them now. They're mine. So I don't know about that toothbrush yet there. Somebody I do not claim somebody else's toothbrush. I'm sorry. But anyway, I I brother Robert really a toothbrush. Anyway, the Lord bless you. [snorts] Ephesians 4:es 1-6. [snorts] I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called, and with all loneliness and meekness, and with long suffering, forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one spirit. Even as you are called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, &gt;&gt; one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in you all. &gt;&gt; Amen. But unto every one of us is given a given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men. Now that he ascended, what is it? But that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth. And he that descended is the same also that ascended far above all heavens that he might fill all things. And he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, and for the edifying of the body of Christ. till we all come in the unity of the faith. So all of this that God is purposing and putting into the church has an end result. This is where God wants to lead you &gt;&gt; until we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, &gt;&gt; unto the measure, the stature of the fullness of Christ, &gt;&gt; that you hence swore be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the slight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in weight to deceive, but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body fitly joined together, compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. Please note verse three. Once again, Ephesians 4:3, endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. May God bless the reading of his word. You all may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord. And I would like you to now just turn with me to the book of Revelation, chapter 2. Revel, excuse me, Revelation 22. Revelations 22. And let us look of a prophetic word of what God is doing in this hour. I'm interested not only for what God has done historically. Yes, it's good to look back into the Old Testament to into the New Testament to see the things that God did because if you look and you see the things that God did and how he did them, you'll begin to see a pattern. And brother Brennham says, I begin to see that pattern develop all the way from Genesis to Revelation. And he said if you understand that formula or the pattern he says then you'll know that God is the same yesterday, today and forever. He changes not. &gt;&gt; The only thing he changes is his mask. &gt;&gt; You know some say well put the prophet of God back in the pulpit. May I tell you the prophet has never lo left the pulpit. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Understand? Because the the brother Brennham said really the prophet of every hour is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that it's not a single man? It's not a single ministry, but it is now gone from a oneman ministry through prophetic uh oversight as an angel messenger to this age. Now, there's where brother says God through that one voice is ordained to take you back to the faith of your Pentecostal fathers. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now that messenger, that is his purpose to to transition you &gt;&gt; to take you from here to another place." What I said the other day and I I very much meant it is that we are changing dimensions. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that we are already in the process that transformation is taking place &gt;&gt; and one day it will transform us into another dimension. But right now little by little &gt;&gt; we're being transformed. We're being lifted up. &gt;&gt; We're being given revelation. And that revelation is what is transforming you. &gt;&gt; Because the prophet of God said, "Faith is the the power of transformation." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, understand that. But I I want to um and I I don't want to get ahead of myself for perhaps the next Sunday or or so, but I want you to get out of your onedimensional thinking. &gt;&gt; And I want you to realize that God is multi-dimensional. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the same yesterday. That's one dimension. &gt;&gt; The same today, another dimension, and in the future. all different dimensions. And yet he's God. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't dwell just in time because he's a he's a God of eternity. &gt;&gt; Time means nothing to God. &gt;&gt; And and so uh I I want to if I could say quicken your mortal minds out of carnal &gt;&gt; and educational thinking. Amen. &gt;&gt; And start thinking on spiritual levels. &gt;&gt; The only way that you can get into spiritual things is to seek him. &gt;&gt; If you don't seek him if you don't ask, &gt;&gt; you won't get. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said, "You must ask him &gt;&gt; with your own mouth." Even on those on the road to Emmas, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. They compelled him, "Stay here with us." &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, if there's ever a time when the church must say, "Stay here with us. &gt;&gt; I'M ASKING YOU. I'M COMPELLING YOU. I'M NOT GOING TO let you go. THE DAY IS FAR SPENT." HOW MANY OF YOU REALIZE, &gt;&gt; HUH? By spiritual revelation, this day is far spent. &gt;&gt; I FEEL WE'RE OVERDUE. We're we're in the days of the longsuffering &gt;&gt; of God. And I say, "Come quickly, Lord Jesus." This uniting that is taking place is uh been quickened to me here uh just recently to a another level &gt;&gt; and I feel very much compelled to share that with you. And so I I I pray that you will pray for your pastor Okay? That God will take us and use us. He said, "You pastors, get into this word. Begin to eat it yourself. I must be a partaker myself. &gt;&gt; I must get into it myself first because how can I lead you into shady green pastures unless I know where I'm going?" &gt;&gt; Okay? to bring to you spiritual food in due season. &gt;&gt; And uh so in Revelation chapter 22 here um and I I let you be seated, but we're standing in our spirit because uh we're honoring God when we read his word in Revelation 22:17-21. And the spirit, notice that is capital S. That means God's spirit, not human spirit, but God's spirit. The spirit and the bride say come. &gt;&gt; So whatever the spirit is actually quickening, the bride is saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; Come and let him that heareth. So the spirit is speaking through the bride and to him that heareth because now both are saying the same thing. Come. &gt;&gt; Now that is not a suggestion. &gt;&gt; THAT IS A COMMANDMENT. COME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN you ask your children, IF YOUR CHILD WAS OUT HERE playing on the street and cars were going by and you saw that they were in danger, there would be there would be something in your voice from your mothers or your fathers &gt;&gt; that should quicken to THAT SON WHO'S OUT there not realizing he's in danger. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU WOULD SAY, "COME, COME NOW. &gt;&gt; THERE WOULD BE AN URGENCY. &gt;&gt; There would be it would be a command &gt;&gt; that must be obeyed. &gt;&gt; Are are we together? &gt;&gt; SO THIS EMPHATIC COME IS NOT JUST a suggestion &gt;&gt; but it's a compelling &gt;&gt; a command. &gt;&gt; Come &gt;&gt; and let him that is a thirst. So he that hearth and he that's thirsty let him come and whosoever will let him take of water of life freely. Now just for a moment because brother Brandham was walking with brother Floyd Patterson one time hunting in Colorado. This is personal testimony. And he says, of course, walking with the prophet of God, he said, uh, you know, uh, you listen very carefully because a prophet is always expounding on the word, okay? Whether he's hunting or whatever. Now, just letting you know that when they went hunting, all of the brethren that were invited to go with brother Brennham were were instructed very carefully, "Brother Brennham is out here, just rest and relax, have a good time." And he said, "He always drops into spiritual channels, but we don't want you to ask him questions." He said, "Is that clear to every one of those invited?" Because they said, "Let him because they said that he would sit around the the fireplace." And one time he stood up. There was brother Roy Borders and brother Floyd and a couple two or three other men. This wasn't a large group. And said the prophet of God began to just kind of say a little bit about his life and about the angel of the Lord. And all of a sudden, he stands up. All it is is there's a a campfire. And around this campfire, the prophet of God said, "He's here now." And he starts walking. He said, "Brother Floyd described, he said he started walking as a drunk man." He said, "His eyes rolled back." He said, "He's here." And when he did, there was such a presence of God and and and they're watching him intently because they know that when he said he's here and whenever he comes, something very special &gt;&gt; happens. That means even in church, &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. in your prayer class, &gt;&gt; in a song special, in a dream. &gt;&gt; When he comes, there's something special. &gt;&gt; He said, "He's here now." And they're intently listening. &gt;&gt; And they said that he stood, his eyes roll back, and he turns to them quickly, "Ask what you will." And he, brother Floyd said, brother Ron, the the presence of God was so strong. He said, "What do I ask? I could have asked anything." He said, "I now this is what brother Floyd told me personally. He said, if I had another day to relive a moment in my life, &gt;&gt; he said, I would love to go back to that day because I would ask because you have to ask it shall be given. &gt;&gt; And so they they told the the brethren when you go hunting there just don't ask questions. Let him &gt;&gt; said because he'll drop into a channel. So, Brother Floyd is is going he and brother Brandham are leaving the camp site that morning to go out and go hunting. He said uh he said, "Brother Floyd, I know you have an awful lot on your heart." He actually gave Brother Floyd a nickname. He called him Brother Pat. Brother Random loved to get nicknames. So, he said, "Brother Pat," he said, "I know there's a lot on your heart." He said, "I want you I want you to go up this direction." He said, "I'm See that?" He said, "See that large tree up there on the hill? It'll take us about 45 minutes to hike to get up there." He said, "I'll meet you at that tree and by the time I reach it, I'll have a word for you." Imagine that. My goodness. So they go up there and they get there and to the best of my recollection of this being told they're walking and he says, "Brother Floyd, Brother Pat," he says, "the Bible says, "Let whosoever will." But it's not. &gt;&gt; Imagine that. The The Bible says, we just read it. Let whosoever will, he said, but it's not. He says, because no man can come &gt;&gt; except the father draws him first. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; So here it would look like he he he's actually contradicting the Bible. He's not. &gt;&gt; He's intensifying it. &gt;&gt; He's bringing it to a greater understanding. LET WHOSOEVER WILL COME So this is is an invite for whosoever will that has an ear that's thirsting &gt;&gt; AS THE SPIRIT IS speaking &gt;&gt; let them come. &gt;&gt; Okay. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So then verse 18. For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book. If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book. This is a warning. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book, &gt;&gt; which he he which testifith, saith the these things, surely I come quickly, even Amen. Even so, come Lord Jesus. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. Now, I would like to title my sermon this morning, and I don't know how far I will get, but I wish to just um expound on a few things, but not to belabor them. So uh again I bear uh your patience, your understanding for my having to go into this because as a pastor you must address certain issues. Pastoring a church in the 21st century is one of the hardest things that one can do. It's not just preaching. That's the easiest part of pastoring. Okay. I remember John Dubsky and different ones that have worked very closely with me for years and sat into the times of counsel. He said, "Brother Ron, you couldn't make me want to be a pastor with all the money in the world." He said, you know, and different ones. And you have to understand it. It it takes a man called of God. Otherwise, you'll be you'll be crushed under the pressure. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because there's pressures that come because you've got to you've got to correct. You've got to say things. You've got to Brother Brennham said, "Every every good cowboy." Now, I was raised around horses and different things. And he said, "Every good cowboy makes sure what his horse is eating from." He said he doesn't let his or horse eat loco weed because if he eats loco weed you won't be able to ride him. &gt;&gt; 21st century parable. &gt;&gt; Some of you may be chewing on some loco weed that you haven't. So, I I need to say, "Hey, hey, hey." And and you know, &gt;&gt; it's hard to get something that that horse has been chewing on. Hey, spit that out. It's not like a dog, hey, let go. Drop that ball. A horse, he looks at you and keeps chewing. So, you [snorts] just don't reach up in a horse's mouth and grab it out and everything because he just keeps chewing. So, anyway, I am entitling my sermon the uniting time and But now as a pastor, I'm taking this subject and this will lead off into something here for the near future. Endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit. I'm endeavoring to do that &gt;&gt; because in this day and hour there are so many spirits and there are so many voices in the land. Brother Brennham said many times what it'll do it will come and try to bring division among us. The apostle Paul says, "Mark them which cause division you'll bring to you uh endless genealogies and questions that gender strife." Theological questions that really, you know, uh did Adam have a navl? &gt;&gt; Who cares? I You know, to me, he's the first one. He didn't come through the womb. So, did he have a navl? Well, it really bears no significance to any of us. It's interesting. I might say, "Well, probably not." But, uh, I don't know. He might have came from the very womb of God and therefore because he was birthed in. Do you see what I'm saying? I I DON'T KNOW. It doesn't really matter. that has no bearance on you as a Christian doctrally of where you're going and what you believe. Who cares? &gt;&gt; So, there are some theological questions that can't be answered that really all they do is gender strife. &gt;&gt; And I think sometimes different ones love to get off into these areas and and stuff. And if brother Brennham, let me just clarify this that if brother Brennham doesn't say it, We don't have to go out here and try to experiment and try to clarify something. If he didn't do it, stay on solid ground. &gt;&gt; Is the earth flat or round? Some have said, "Well, this flat because the Bible says four corners." Ah, and on and on and on. Nonsense. Stop it. Christopher Columbus was told that he's going to come the world. He's going to sail and he's going to drop right off. And he says, "Well, I've seen in my telescope." Now, watch the simplicity. &gt;&gt; He said, "I've watched a ship as it sails to sea and it goes out and I watch and the big high mass and the big billowing sails as it goes off into the horizon." And he said it totally sinks down and down and I realize it's going over something and it disappearing. Is it falling off the edge of the world or is it showing simplicity that the earth is round? When you fly up into space and turn around and take a picture of the earth, is it flat? Ah, you see. Anyway, I I don't know why I'm getting off onto that. I'm just saying those things gender strife. It doesn't really matter. You can't preach it for doctrine. Now, if you want to with your church, go ahead, brother. Yeah, you can tell them it's flat all you want and everything like that. But to me, I say no. I, you know, I'm going to stay with what the prophet of God said. Now, um, we know that there are seasons. Now follow along with me right now in your spiritual mind that there are times and seasons for everything under heaven. &gt;&gt; A time to be born, a time to die, a time to sew, and a time to reap. Do you understand? So there's a time for everything. So there's times and seasons that we have seen from Genesis chapter 1 all the way through to the end of the book of Revelation. We know that there are times and seasons. Now, brother Brennham says in every time God will give that time a sign. &gt;&gt; He never leaves an age or a time. But what he gives a voice or a sign to that age. &gt;&gt; Now, not everyone will accept the sign. They may see it. They may even read it or hear it, but they won't understand it. &gt;&gt; What good is to see a sign and might say Phoenix 20 miles. If you don't know how to read, it's just a sign. &gt;&gt; But a sign is a declaration. &gt;&gt; So, we have seen the sign of a of a prophetic ministry. &gt;&gt; And you've all been privy to this. This has not been done in a corner. &gt;&gt; This is something that uh has taken place and all of us are able to look into it. Now whether or not you can look beyond the sign is up to whether or not you're elected to go beyond. &gt;&gt; You've got to be predestinated. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we know that there are times and seasons in God's word that it must become manifest. That's what is bearing upon my heart. I want to know what is my season. Where are we at chronologically? What are the promises that we can claim as the bride of this hour for our inheritance? Brother Bram said, "You can claim the promises. Uh, we're going to build an ark and we're going to float through the tribulation." He said, "You can you can try to bring those promises to pass." But he said, "God, that was not your season. &gt;&gt; That was Noah's season." &gt;&gt; Do you understand? So, we have to come into the understanding of the time and the season we're in. Now, brother Brennham said there are five musts. &gt;&gt; Five musts that every must fit that criteria. So, let's look at this for a moment. It must be according to God's time. &gt;&gt; You understand? It must be according to God's season. So, let me give you an example of that. We know we're in Laiusa. That is a time. That is an age. But there is a season within that time. &gt;&gt; We not only need to know the time, but the season &gt;&gt; is it planting time or is it harvest time? &gt;&gt; The season changes within the time. So it must be according to God's word because the prophet preaches a sermon called the absolute &gt;&gt; and he says the word of God is our thumbum &gt;&gt; and he says that is our measuring post and he said though an angel or another messenger come down and preach to you another gospel let him be accursed. Okay. So, it must be according to the word of God. That is a major. We don't uh we don't take that very lightly. Number four, there must be uh it must be the person whom God chose. &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of times we see within the scriptures that man chooses one but God chose another. We see uh in the days of Samuel, God had sent Samuel as a prophet to lead the people. But they wanted a king. &gt;&gt; So the people chose a king, but God chose Samuel. &gt;&gt; Now Samuel took it personally, didn't he? Well, they've rejected me. And God says, "Wake up, Samuel. They didn't reject you. They rejected me &gt;&gt; because I'm the one who sent you. So they're not rejecting you. They're rejecting me. &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; And all of that will tie into maybe the question that I'll be answering even the this morning. So again, put on your spiritual thinking caps. Number five, it must be uh a true inspired revelation and vindicated of God by its manifesting itself in fruits. Now, how do you know what kind of a tree it is until you see the fruit? &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but there's all kinds of citrus trees. &gt;&gt; There's lemon trees, there's orange trees, there's all kinds of citrus, grapefruit. I don't know. Well, I'm not that good to be able to look and see, well, that's a grapefruit until I see grape fruit on the tree. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Or an orange. How do you know it's an orange? &gt;&gt; Got it's gotten Yeah. &gt;&gt; If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, quacks like a duck, &gt;&gt; there's a good chance it's a duck. &gt;&gt; SO, YOU UNDERSTAND? YEAH, &gt;&gt; you all all are known by the fruits on your tree. &gt;&gt; Are you a believer? Let me see. Believing fruit. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SAY YOU are a orange tree. Brother Brennham said, here's a quote. He says, you can vehemently say you're an orange tree. He says, but until you bear orange fruit, he says, then I doubt your testimony. He says, "I'm not judging you. I'm just a fruit inspector." &gt;&gt; That's all we're doing. We're just inspecting your fruit. &gt;&gt; Now, [clears throat] we know that the world is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. You cannot come into that position until you know the inspired inspiration or the revelation to be manifested for your hour &gt;&gt; until it's brought to your attention &gt;&gt; and then you claim it. &gt;&gt; First you see it, YOU SAY, "OH, WOW. HERE'S A promise for the bride. Here's a promise for the elect seed in this end time. Here's the end time seed sign. Here's the uniting time and sign here. And so, Brother Brennan, when he gives these sermon titles, they're declarations. &gt;&gt; They're not just uh uh something that he brought. Well, I'll just talk about the invisible union of the bride. And then he never does talk about it. I know there are ministers that love to give some kind of flowery, mysterious sermon and when you get done and they there was nothing that matched the sermon title uh with the their sermon they're preaching. &gt;&gt; Well, [clears throat] I just think that the prophet of God was so simple. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that what he would do is he'll give a declaration &gt;&gt; and then he expounds on it. If he's going to talk about filters, okay, where did he get the sermon about filters? Cigarette pack. Where in the world would you get a sermon from a cigarette pack? In fact, he's out walking along and the spirit of the Lord quickens to him and said, "Pick up that cigarette pack." Ain't going to pick up cigarette pack that was thrown off to the side. You know, probably smoked all of them and they threw them off to the side. Ain't no way. No, go back and pick it up. So he picks it up and he, you know, thinking man's filter. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham talks in that sermon about filters, natural and spiritual. &gt;&gt; Now understand, he said, according to your taste, if you got a worldly man's taste, you will choose a church that will supply a worldly man's taste. it will satisfy. &gt;&gt; He said it won't. You won't find a pastor that's preaching against the things of the world. Why? Because that's not your filter. &gt;&gt; So, brother Brennham talks about natural filters, spiritual filters. And he says, "And the greatest filter that we can have today is the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, understand this. Now let me just go into a natural so that you understand this direction. We talk about times and seasons. You know that winter is coming because you see the effects of its coming. You see the change in the weather. You see the change in the color of the trees. What does that indicate to you? Oh, we're entering into the fall of the year. where it is winter. It's coming now. Hey, I'll tell you what. Even this morning, you can you you know, compared to yesterday's morning, this morning's a LITTLE BIT NIPPY. WE REALLY DON'T have a winter here in Arizona. It gets cold a few times, but you know, different ones that come down from up north or they're from the way up there and everything come they come down and they'll spend January or so uh here and they'll take a walk in the desert and and maybe they'll go early morning or they'll go out and go camping in our desert thinking it don't get cold in Arizona and all of a sudden they're going man it's cold because you don't expect it to be cold &gt;&gt; if you're up north where it's 20 below, you're going to dress accordingly and you kind of expect it down here. You a man, it's 70°. Take off your coat. You need a sleeping bag. I'll probably just dislay you. See what I'm saying? So, you notice the change in the temperature because winter is breathing down your neck. You You can tell you can feel its effects. Even here in Arizona, not as much as you would in perhaps Canada or up in the frozen north, but we feel it nevertheless. Here recently, we just went through Christmas and New Year. How did you know Christmas was coming? Because every time I went to the mall, guess what? Jingle bells, jingle bells, you better be naughty or nice cuz Santa's coming to town. You know, all this stuff. it. What? What was it? All of everything was letting go. The season, it's declaring, "Hey, December, Christmas, and everybody starts thinking about getting gifts." And I don't know about you, but I hate to go to the mall during November, December. It's just a mad rush. People spending money that they don't have debt. And they said the average American income family will go into debt for a period of nine months for what they spend to give their kids on Christmas. They'll go into debt. They won't be able to pay it off. So, man, they throw out the credit card there and and they spend money that they don't have. Listen, if if you're one of those that has a credit card and you don't think about it and you run that thing up, you're not a good steward, a good ambassador. I had a brother just recently, just two days ago. He said, "Uh, brother Ron, you know, my dearly beloved brother in Christ, I, you know, and big spiritual letter and everything like this." And, you know, I met you and over in Indonesia and we were at the ministers meeting and here's the photo of you and I together and on and and by the way, I uh I got myself into a terrible debt. Now, I need to pay the debt. I need you to give me the money that I can pay my debt. [clears throat] And uh so he he did the snapshot of his credit card and and and then he did the the you know the exchange of what it was in their money over to us and you know here it is right at $4,000. So my brother beloved brother in Christ please I compel you. Are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; Huh? I don't even listen. I don't do that with my kids. You if you spent the money, hey, if you're foolish enough to spend the money and you don't have it, then it's a good thing for you to work hard. &gt;&gt; Dig yourself out of the hole. And I guarantee you, IF YOU SUFFER ENOUGH, you won't do it again. &gt;&gt; But if you don't suffer from it, if somebody bails you out, guess what? next week. Yeah. Throw that old card out there, man. Huh? &gt;&gt; All right. So, the signs for going from natural now to spiritual. Matthew 24 talks about the signs of the end time. Matthew 24 talks about a time of war and a time of earthquakes and the seas w the the roaring waves of the sea tsunamis on and on. Can we see those signs? It seems like every day another earthquake uh another tsunami another this different things happening. Brother Brennham said those things are given to you as signs. And brother Brennham says the earth is HAVING BIRTH PAINANS. HE actually preaches a whole sermon. He said if you'll notice those things in the natural, they're typing something in the spiritual. &gt;&gt; And he says THIS KINGDOM IS TRYING IS HAVING a a nervous breakdown. Mother Earth is is trembling. She's being RAPED AND PILLAGED OF ALL OF HER NATURAL SOURCES. ALL of her her lakes and rivers and air, everything is polluted. THE FORESTS are cut down. The mineral sources are just DEPLETED TO VAST DEGREES. We've made our our our air to where it's breathable. Let me tell you, if you think this place is nice now, wait till it's renovated, &gt;&gt; huh? &gt;&gt; Boy, you talk about a remodel. &gt;&gt; If you if you think the mountains are green right now and the rivers are blue and the just wait till we get over there. &gt;&gt; You're going to go, "Oh, [laughter] this is amazing." So I'm saying that the signs that we see now let me just bring to you a sign before I launch off into into a question in questions and answers in Hebrews chapter 2 in 1957. Brother Brennham, I'm bringing this to your attention [snorts] now. When the end time comes, and we're getting down to the end, if I see it right, the gospel is there's supposed to be a great revival taking place. So, he's saying, I if I see it right, we're coming to the end and there's got to be a great revival. Now, did you know that the Jewish flag is the oldest flag in the world? Been uh laying dormant for 2,000 years, more than yay, about 2500 years. The Jewish flag, the sixpoint start of David, never flowed for 2500 years since the carrying away of Babylon. And now because of Roman Empire took them over and the Messiah come and they rejected it, they were scattered to the four winds of the earth. Now hold on to that for just a second. Don't don't keep reading. Follow me. He says, "Now they're scattered. The dispersa, they were scattered all over the world." Now Jews whenever they go into another country because they're businessminded. Hey, listen. You want to go into a country and find who's got a thriving business, find a Jew. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They prosper. &gt;&gt; Okay? And they don't intermar. They just they stay among themselves. And so when they go into uh an area, they they start companies, they start thriving, and they start doing well. Well, once once they're there and they're located and they've they've made their business there, they stay there. So, what's going to move them from there to get them back to their homeland? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini, pre-tribulation spirits. &gt;&gt; He said, "We're driving elect." &gt;&gt; And he said, "That was the tender, merciful hand of Jehovah." &gt;&gt; Now, to you and I, it don't look like that. Right. &gt;&gt; Hey, taking the the Jews and killing them, making them wear a a yellow star and and taking them out of their homes and and crystal knocked and over there in Germany. And you you all know the story. And yet, brother Brennham said God had to do it to drive them back into their homeland because a Jew as Abraham out of his homeland is not an inheritor of the promises. And we as believers &gt;&gt; are not inheriting of the promises UNTIL YOU'RE IN YOUR RIGHTFUL POSITION of the word of the hour FOR THIS DAY. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE OUT HERE DOING things that you shouldn't and you're living in areas that you shouldn't AND YOU'RE ON THE wrong land, &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A PROMISED LAND WE CALL THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. IT'S OURS. IT'S TIME TO GO POSSESS IT. &gt;&gt; Off your mountain, round and round. How many YEARS UNTIL YOU GET OFF YOUR MOUNTAIN? &gt;&gt; Go possess the land. &gt;&gt; Okay, now watch. Let's go back to this quote. [snorts] Did you know on May the 6th, 1946, the flag that came back over Jerusalem again? Did you know on May the 7th, 1946, the angel of the Lord appeared to me the next day up here and sent me into the world to bring forth a revival. The very next morning when that flag raised in Jerusalem as the going down of the sun of that afternoon, the angel Lord appeared here in the United States. at the same time. &gt;&gt; When you see the fig tree and the rest of the trees putting forth. &gt;&gt; So now we see that in 1946 a fig tree is putting forth its buds. If you're spiritual, you'll see that when you see the fig tree Israel &gt;&gt; coming back, he said you know that summer is nigh. &gt;&gt; Okay. So the very same hour, the very same day that he said God is dealing with Israel, HE SAYS GOD SENDS the angel to me with this message because you can't have the Jews come to their position until the Gentiles take theirs. &gt;&gt; Because we have to finish what is called the Gentile dispensation. We're just a little grafted in &gt;&gt; branch &gt;&gt; at this time and until the days of the Gentiles be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; So we're in the times of the Gentiles. God blinded the Jews. &gt;&gt; And he did it purposely. &gt;&gt; Why? He had to do that. So true Jews will never see the light of this message &gt;&gt; because they're blinded to it. Because the only ones that are going to open their eyes, there's two witnesses according to the book of Revelation. Who are they? Moses and Elijah. They are the two witnesses. Now understand, okay, I'll I'll say this by Revelation. If you see on CNN or Fox News &gt;&gt; two witnesses start calling signs down from heaven and doing all of this stuff. You done missed your day &gt;&gt; and you're headed for tribulation. And you that never got the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; okay, and never took your position, &gt;&gt; you're going to be it'll it'll be a t. He told Billy Paul, he said, "Brother Billy, whatever you do, don't you miss it. &gt;&gt; You think you think you got pressure on you now? &gt;&gt; You just wait." He said, "What's holding the judgment from the earth right now?" He said, "There's a thin red line." &gt;&gt; He said, "That represents the blood. Take off of the bride. Off of the earth, the blood is removed. &gt;&gt; And now, guess what? Judgment. &gt;&gt; Now, the bride, the only judgment she sees is here. It's right now. It's going on right now. That's why you're here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not here to see how good you are. You're to see where you fall short. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. God, show me. If there's an area, hey, THAT'S WHAT WE DO. GOD, SHOW ME. I DON'T I DON'T WANT TO COME HERE looking down. I'M I'M GLAD I'M NOT LIKE HIM. I I don't want to have some Pharisee religion. Well, I tell you what, I'm better than him. I at least I'm here once in a while. Uh he don't come every six weeks. &gt;&gt; Well, that's comparing ourselves among ourselves and we become foolish. &gt;&gt; Don't choose, if you're going to really choose somebody, CHOOSE SOMEBODY THAT'S THERE ALL THE TIME. CHOOSE SOMEBODY THAT'S THAT'S BETTER THAN YOU. &gt;&gt; We have a tendency. Huh? Well, just like if you're going to learn a sport, I don't care if it's pickle ball or basketball or football, if you're going to get better, choose somebody that's much better than you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz they will inspire you. &gt;&gt; You pick a guy. Hey, do you know how to play pickle ball? No, I've never played it. Good. Come here. I'm going to beat you every See, get out of the kitchen. What do you mean the kitchen? I'm not in the kitchen. Just volley that thing. &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? You're going to you're going to choose somebody that's better than you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because you want to get closer to God. Choose friends &gt;&gt; that you know their life &gt;&gt; is close to God. &gt;&gt; Don't choose somebody that the guy's struggling and having a hard time and I just can't and always and you know, oh hey, you know this and that and I don't think this and over here and all these questions and stuff. You're you're never going to grow. Get somebody that that that hey, how you doing today, man? Praise God. Yeah. Amen. I'm overcoming. I'm doing good. and and you know they're going through a trial. &gt;&gt; You're never gonna be without trials in this life. &gt;&gt; You're either going into a trial or coming out of one. &gt;&gt; Okay? But trials are here &gt;&gt; and they're going to get tougher. &gt;&gt; But that's okay. God's grace is get greater. &gt;&gt; Okay? Now, so I saying all that. So [clears throat] bear with me for just a few moments. And I want to give a disclosure before I get into this uh this question that this is to my church and my church only. If you guys are visitors, God bless you. Just sit and listen or you know go get a drink or something while I answer these things. Uh because it's not to you. This is this is to my church. Even brother Brandham said, "Now those that are listening in the tape, these are my people that God's Do you understand?" So this disclosure, I'm saying, "Hey, I'm not trying to be the internet pastor and everybody follow me and every I'm going to see how Hey, if you like my YouTube, go ahead and subscribe. Hit right there. Give me the deal because if you support and I want to hear the bell ring and every time every Sunday you'll get the next sermon. Oh, nonsense. That is not my desire. I'm going to get into something some things here in a moment. So just bear with me. So giving a disclosure if you are from another church and listening to this service whether you are here physically or you are archiving or you are streaming [snorts] uh just let me speak to my my people here. Now first question the brother brought it up to me. He said, "Brother Robert, your song leader, mentioned over the pulpit to pray for a sister who is a faithful streamer to our assembly but does not attend our church in person." So he says, he says, "Brother Ron, he brother Robert says, "Oh, let's pray for sister who is a faithful streamer. She sends her tithes and everything." Well, they catch that. So here here was the question. What is the difference between staying home and streaming a service? Just the same as there are many message believers who are staying at home and pressing play. Legitimate question. Okay. So what is the difference? Okay. Okay. Now, first off, I want to say the reason we have streaming now, brother Stafford Massie asked me years ago. He said, "Brother Ron, do you want to be the first pastor that's on the internet with streaming?" I said, "What's that?" Oh, well, hey man, that's the latest thing. You're there's going to be all kinds of stuff and you can be the first one. I said, "I'm not interested." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Anyway, so the reason that we stream our services is for the convenience of those who can't make it to service for whatever reason. They were sick, they're on vacation, etc., etc. We do have some that have medical reasons why they can't be in service and maybe they haven't been here in a year or two &gt;&gt; and yet they faithfully stream the service because they consider this their home church. They pay their tithes and yet &gt;&gt; that's true. &gt;&gt; Is that true, brother Robert? &gt;&gt; And then there are some, brother Robert, that send their tithing in. And you all know, listen to me now that I do not propagate my ministry and say, "Hey, all of you out there, uh, well, you that uh, listen to this, send me your tithes and this." No, I am not an internet preacher. I've got one I'm a husband of one wife. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennan, I'm going to give you the quote. Some of you, what are you talking about? Brother Brennham says, "The pastor, spiritually speaking, is the husband to the church." So, I'm not interested in having other wives in other countries and other places and them all supporting me. And I did have an elder within the message. I'm just sharing with you some of my experiences. He said, 'Why, brother Ron, you were over in Europe and you know so many churches and and and so many people over there and all these people and some of them you have birthed into Christ. You should start a little group in Germany over here, one in France and one in Belgium and one in Holland and and and ordained a minister there and put him as pastor and then have them all send you their tithing and then you can come back once every three, four months. Oh, God bless you. collect the ties and give them a little flowery sermon and and and go on. And then he said, "Brother Ron," he said, "then you can sit back in your old age and everybody just keeps sending you money. I'm the husband of one wife." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am not. Now watch the internet has developed things called internet ministries. And some of them don't even have a home church. Some of them just do it by a podcast. Some of it do it and you know what they do? Hey, if you like, subscribe. Send us your like this. Okay. And so anyway, I'm just saying the times have changed here in the day and the hour in which we live. In in in fact, I told you this before, Brother Austin Johnson, you were with me the last time you and I got together and you said, "Brother Ron, I want to show you something." Uh, and you there with your cell phone, your cell phone didn't even have your computer. Okay. AI. I don't know who he spoke to, if it was Siri or somebody, but he spoke to his phone and he says, "I want you to design a sermon about God's love and I want you to use scriptures." Within seconds, bang, they come up here. Brother Ron, look at that. Oh, man. All these scriptures. Oh, wow. This is amazing. This is amazing. And he says, "Okay, now uh AI, I want you to take all of the quotes from the message of the hour of William Brham, and I want you to incorporate that into that sermon." Seconds later, he said, "Look at this, brother. Is this true?" &gt;&gt; I'm going, "Austin, that's great. You need to you need to give me this hat, man. [laughter] My days of laboring over sermons What does the ABC mean? &gt;&gt; Always. It doesn't mean Appleuilt computer. &gt;&gt; You see, you do not. Brother Brennham says God doesn't use mechanical devices. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, we're going to go into something here and I want you to understand. We're just laying a little bit of a foundation. But it's amazing how that ministries even today are using artificial intelligence which comes from the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; Now the other day because I went to uh [snorts] I went to Home Depot because I was looking for a little thing that goes to the end of the faucet and to a garden hose hooks up to it. It's called a uh valve pressure release thing. Okay. I I didn't know what it was and what its name was. The only thing is this one didn't work on my home. I took it off with a pair of pliers, took it to Home Depot, and the guy says, "Well, I really don't know. Hang on here just a second." He took his phone, took a picture. What is this? All of a sudden, AI found it. Oh, that is called a pressure relief valve. And that could be found in and here you can find one at Ace Hardware. You can go here to Lowe's and Don and such and such plumbing department has it and everything. Wow. I did it. I went ahead because the other So I went to uh Ace Hardware because it said they have them. So, I went in there and I said, uh, I says, "I want a water pressure relief valve that goes there. Then you hook your spot up, excuse to this faucet and your hose up to it." And the guy says, "Well, here, uh, let's go over here." And he shows me and he says, "And this was the wrong size." I said, "No, no, it's got to be not from 3/4 to 3/4. This has got to be from a 1 and16th to 3/4 reduction. Ah, no. I don't think I said hang on here just a second. [laughter] Here it is. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I have one. Aisle 20, top shelf. He went over there, picked it up. I said, "Thank you." Wonderful. I I we're we're in an age now where hey um here years ago, this is 10 or 12 years ago when brother Aaron McGary was here. Now he's so sharp on a computer. We were at Home Depot getting some parts and we happened to pick up a part that doesn't have a price on it. Have you ever done that? &gt;&gt; No. out of the whole bin out of 30 pieces. I picked one that doesn't have the the price or the code. So the guy says, "Uh, okay, hang on just a second. Um, we need a price check on aisle three over here bring like this." And so this guy's coming and Aaron says, "Hang on. Here it is. 13 cents." I said, "How did you do that?" He said, "It's simple." Well, listen, you can't teach an old dog new tricks, you know. I Hey, I am just I have just barely mastered cut and paste. Anything beyond that, my phone or my computer does something and it goes into cyberspace or it does something. When I get upgrades, it's the most frustrating thing in the world because I'm used to doing it a certain way. Now they get the upgrade and it moves the query box from the top to the bottom. Where where is this thing? Oh, it's down here. I'm just a creature of habit. So, I'm seeing all of this. Okay, now just bear with me. I told you. Okay. The reason that we stream and archive our services is for the convenience of our church and our church only. Now, there are some churches that require a password. If you want to get on there and find out what that pastor is preaching, you need to write in and if they give you an authority approval, they'll give you a password and then you can find out. Well, I'm not there almost, but I'm not there at that. Listen, [clears throat] if someone who streams our services are listening to an archive sermon and they like it, fine. That's wonderful. And many people say, "Brother Ron, oh, I enjoyed that service. That's great." And uh or if they don't like it, then uh hey, you know, you're off your rocker. You're this and that. And and listen, I get those all the time. Well, listen, I'm not your pastor. criticize someone else. I'm here for this group. Now, if it's my group, you send it to me. Okay, then we'll address it. So, um anyway, some critics take my services and even have taken what we've said and cut and splice it and put it onto their website and saying, "Brother Ron, did you notice, Brother Ron? Oh, where's the picture of the pillar of fire? Oh, where's the picture of Brother Brennham? I've never had him up, but they said I did. And I said, 'Well, they took him down. Oh, such nonsense. They use AI. Do you know how how AI can take a picture of you &gt;&gt; and make you say something you didn't? Or uh you know, next thing you know, hey, I was never with brother Brandham, but I can take a picture of myself. And I say, now put me next to brother Brandham and I'll send you a Christmas card with me and Brother Brandham. I don't know how to do it, but it's being done. In fact, h did any of you guys get Christmas cards or quotes from brother Brandham about New Year's or about Christmas and it gives you this and got a flowery all this kind of stuff and it's a picture and it's been forwarded a 100,000 times and they send it to you. Do you take is that really a nice note from somebody when they forwarded just oh happy new year and merry Christmas? No, I would rather have a sentence from you. Hey, brother Ron, thinking of you. Have a happy new year, Brother John. Hey, good. Otherwise, delete. Gone. &gt;&gt; Nothing personal. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, so although they did the cutting and splicing with Brother Bram's sermons, even right here in Arizona, Brother Bram answers this on on uh on a tape. He says, "Why in Arizona, there's somebody there that's taking my messages and cutting them up and splicing them, making it say something I didn't say." And so even now within the message, different ones, whoever they are, they're they are the modern-day shimeies who are just trying to find criticism with God's anointed &gt;&gt; and all they want to do is just create trouble and they're whatever. And I say, "Hey, you know what? God reward them for the chaos that they you understand that word reward." So anyway, God reward them for the chaos that they are bringing because now listen, I'm endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit. &gt;&gt; I cannot keep the unity of the spirit unless I have the spirit. &gt;&gt; So I must work on the Holy Spirit to keep me humble, &gt;&gt; not arrogant, not proud. One person asked the other day, and I'm getting ahead of myself, but that's okay. Okay. As they said, well, you know what's wrong with you pastors? You guys are not doing what Brother Renham said? You're proud. You're dictators. Once you get voted in, you why I tell you, then you just you're so proud and arrogant. You take all the tithing to yourself and this and that and you stand there and and everything. You're supposed to be voted in every year. Where do you get that? Show me the quote. [snorts] I want to ask you at Brandham Tabernacle, did they vote on Brother Brenham every year? No, they didn't. When did they start voting every year for a pastor at Brandham Tabernacle? Do you know? Well, most people don't. So don't sit there and assume something until you know. &gt;&gt; So brother Brennham's teaching is that once a pastor has voted in, and I'm going to show you some quotes because he talks about all this voting in and voting out. He said that don't mean nothing. He said Elijah was Jezebel's pastor whether she voted for him or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Capiche? You understand that? So, this voting in and voting out. Okay, again, I'm getting ahead of myself here. Um, well, I being that I'm into this, I might as well just go ahead and do it. So, I'm kind of leaving my notes and everything. But did you know that brother Brennham said all this voting in and voting out? He said in the scriptures, he said the first time spiritfilled men took a vote in the New Testament. Any of you, you read the book of Acts? &gt;&gt; Oh, and Judas hung himself. And so now we need another to take his place. &gt;&gt; The first time spiritfilled men took a vote, they voted in the wrong guy. &gt;&gt; How many of you know that? Mias, he never did anything. &gt;&gt; GOD CHOSE [screaming] PAUL. &gt;&gt; If they would have waited, &gt;&gt; they would have seen. &gt;&gt; Are you okay? Are are you understanding this is scripture? &gt;&gt; So anyway, um so let's go into this. Um so sometimes questions come up because certain ones that you associate with will will create questions for you. That's okay. Happens with families and especially happening now among the message and that is you will rub shoulders with some people that do not go to church. They don't believe in going to church. They don't No, brother Brennham is their pastor. They just stay home and press play. I want to I just want to appeal to your understanding. Is this brother Brennham's doctrinal teaching? &gt;&gt; Then why are people fooled by it today? &gt;&gt; Well, there's several reasons. Number one, I don't want to be accountable &gt;&gt; because going to church, you're accountable, &gt;&gt; right? Hey, where were you last Sunday? Well, you know, we went to the ball game. I'm just hypotheticals. So, if you went to a ball game last Sunday, uh I'm not on your case. Nobody told me. But but but uh but understand we're living in an age of virtual reality &gt;&gt; of you don't even have to go to work anymore. What do they call it? You you &gt;&gt; you remote. Yo. Yeah. You don't even have to go to work anymore. You don't even have to dress up, put a tie on, go into a deal, punch a clock, you just go, "Hey, I'm working from home." And some men have I I've seen it. It's so cute where these guys they put on a shirt and perhaps a a a tie and their their coat, but they're still in their underwear or pajamas. They're sitting in front of their their camera. Hey, God bless you. Board meeting. It's so good to just be able to like that. And then their kids come in the back uh door and then you see him or the guy has to get up and go get something and he forgets and then everybody has a big chuckle because he's not even dressed for it. I I this brother that was asking me this question. It's kind of cute. And he said, "You know, Brother Ron," he says, "So what's the difference of staying home and streaming and uh those that just press play at home?" He says, 'Well, let me just tell you what I did with my with my my own family. I said, 'Well, please. So, he says, 'Well, Brother Ron, the first couple times we couldn't make it. We streamed your services. Guess what? We got all the kids up and out of bed. We got them dressed. We got dressed and we sat in the living room. And when you guys sang, we sang. When you stood up, we stood up. When you read your Bible, we read our Bible. He said that lasted a time or two. Then pretty soon, we're in bed in our pajamas. Don't even have to get the kids up and we stream. &gt;&gt; See how easy it is? &gt;&gt; So, hey, there's a lot of times I I would like to just stream. Why fight the traffic? I'm tired. I've got all these excuses. Huh? &gt;&gt; Do you understand? So those that stream, it's a convenience for you and and I do that. I I want you to use it when you can't be here. But nothing replaces being here &gt;&gt; because when you're here, you're under a live ministry. The Bible says to obey those who have the rule over you. You ain't you ain't going to rule over me. You see what I'm saying? Whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation for Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Brother Brandham's teaching, go to church on Sunday. Honor the resurrection. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "GO TO CHURCH. Choose somewhere." &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; But go to church. Have a pastor. Have a place that you pay your tithe. &gt;&gt; It's called your post of duty. &gt;&gt; Now, any of you, anybody in here was ever in the military? Raise your hand. Military. Raymond. Who else? Okay. Brother Don Saunders. Well, after you joined the military and you decided after two weeks of boot camp, you decided you wanted to go to Bahamas uh to just get away because boot camp was a little too hard. Uh were you free to leave? Uh if you left, what would happen? Would they send somebody after you? Or if they don't know where you're at and you got caught, you went awall. Do you know what awall stands for? Absent without leave. Well, you're supposed to be I don't want to Fort Benning, Georgia. Nah, I want to be over in in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Man, that's that's that place I want to be cuz on the weekends, guess what? I want to go to the Sun and Sand. Do you see what I'm saying? All of you have a post of duty. You realize it. Post of duty. Now, that post of duty you've got to take extremely serious because God's got each one of you. Now, it may not be here. It may be somewhere else because guess what? I'm not the only pebble on the beach. I'm not the only pastor. Hey, there are other churches here in Arizona. There's other churches around. Find one that you feel is God ordained to take your and to watch over you. &gt;&gt; Okay? To watch over you because God's going to make me responsible for what I tell you. You will not be responsible for me, but I will be responsible for you. And so there's been so many times that I know that I need to deal with something and I think, "Oh, Lord, I want to do that. I Oh, I'd rather go to the dentist. I [laughter] I don't want to have to say this." Okay? Now, understand this because I I may say some things in the future that's going to cause some people to be a little bit upset with me. Now, understand that the larger our church grows, many of you are what we call transplants. You weren't raised up under our ministry. I didn't birth you in Christ. I haven't always been your pastor. You've been transplanted for somewhere else. &gt;&gt; Great. Praise the Lord. Welcome. Welcome. We're we're glad that you're here. But understand what I have taught to my people. Well, I now need to retach again because I got a lot of people that don't know. So then I go back over some of the ABCs. Right. &gt;&gt; I had a brother, a good friend of mine the other day. He I just happened to stream his service just, you know, it was an archive service and on there and and he was upset with his church and he said, "I tell you what, you guys are so bad and I I'm changing the name of my church to High Heel Tabernacle." I called him the other day and says, "Hey, man." Yeah. Did you hear that, brother? I'm so vexed. You know, I says, "Amen. I've been there. I know." I says, "What it is?" A lot of times they don't know. They don't know. Now, even if you do know, Brother Brennan had to repeatedly tell his own family. Now, if any of you have been here with me long enough, Brother Billy Paul gave me this testimony and he says, "Daddy called me one morning and said, "Billy, get the girls together. I've got thus sayaith the Lord for him. Wow. Get the girls together. Lois, Mida, Rebecca. Okay. Get all of the girls together because I've got thus sayith the Lord. And and Rebecca Smith, she says, "Brother Ron, when uh Bill called us and said, "Daddy's having a meeting just with family and get the girls together." We sat down there and oh man he said she said we were so and he says how many times has your daddy told you take off those high heel shoes and what you do you get a under a little conviction then you take and you get rid of them but a few months later he said you you go and buy another pair. He said, "Now I'm going to tell you for the last time. &gt;&gt; Take off those high heeled shoes or the judgments of God be upon you. I've told you for the last time and I'm not going to tell you again." &gt;&gt; Now Rebecca all of a sudden realized, "Wow, daddy is giving the ultimatum to me. It's up to you." Now, I realize that we've got a lot of different ones. You come from maybe where you come from, it's okay. Your skin down wiener skirts are allowed and and your cleavage is way down to here and you and your customs are that you do all kinds of different things and maybe your pastor allows it. Well, I'm a different kind of sort of guy. And I would rather retire than I would to compromise. &gt;&gt; I would. Now, here was the the the question. What about voting? Why don't you vote your pastor in every year? Show me where Brother Rem said it. Show me where he did it. &gt;&gt; It's not there. The only time they did it was after brother Brandham had stepped down and they got others up there because they wanted to make sure that it because brother Brandon was still the overseer until he died. Okay? And was a brother that got out of the way. In fact, I'll I'll tell you brother Brandham said your pastor is voted in even board members until what is until? until either they step down, resign, or they have an accusation against them and you vote them out. Did you know you can vote me out anytime? All it takes majority vote of the people. &gt;&gt; If something came up now, first off, it's got to be by the mouth of two or more witnesses, &gt;&gt; right? And it's got to been put in writing. &gt;&gt; Well, I saw Brother Ron drinking beer at a bar the other night. Well, for how did you know? Was you there? up. Yeah. With stammering lips. So, what I'm saying is it can't be just by one. No, brother so and so saw it and brother so and you put it in writing and then it's given to the board and the board takes it. Okay. And they then they because the Bible says the Bible says here's your absolute receive not an accusation against an elder except it be by what? &gt;&gt; Two or three witnesses because you just can't do that. So now if you got the two or three witnesses now we got an issue we got to deal with it. Okay. So you can vote the pastor out at any time. Majority vote you can get rid of him. So you don't need to to say, "Well, you arrogant, proud pastors, you've got so much pride. You just once you're in, you are always in and nobody can." &gt;&gt; Wait a second. &gt;&gt; Say what Brother Brennham said. Do what he did and quit throwing your quotes that you have got no foundation for. &gt;&gt; Okay, I hope that settles that one. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Let me show you brother Rem's teaching expectancy 1953. Brother Bodsworth, good evening friends. It's indeed a privilege to be back here tonight to minister to this audience. Tonight is a Sunday night when all the churches are having services of their own. It's Sunday night churches services of their own. We've asked all the people to have their own churches open to stay for their churches tonight. Stay for their churches rather than coming to the camp meeting so they can attend their own church. Here's his teaching. That's our business is to try to keep the people in their churches. And those who do not go to church, we're trying to get them to go to church. very grateful. We trust that you'll all affiliate somewhere with some good church of your choice and we'll make that your church home and remain a Christian as long as you live. 1964 questions answers. Brother Brenham, should we go to other churches even when they disagree with you? Sure. Yep. Jesus did when they disagreed with him. Go ahead and notice here. Should we go to another church that disagrees with you? Sure. I'm not the only pebble on the beach. You know, there's just other godly men everywhere. I hope I'm one of them. Now, do you see do you see Brother Bram's approach? &gt;&gt; I am the only one. I am the Elijah. I am the Malachi 4. And I tell you what, if you go to any other church and you go anywhere else, spiritual adultery and all excommunicate. Look at his teachings. Most of all, look at his character. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I was called in on something like this the other day. So now somebody's got a question. They called him in on it. Hey, we want to ask you. Okay. [snorts] A group in Arizona, Arizona's got all these problems. Called my attention to that. A ministerial group said the only thing we have against you, brother Brandham is one of the things the people said comes out here with you. You can't get them to go to church anywhere. This is 1964. We can't get them to go to church anywhere and they follow you. You can't get them to go to church. Well, he told them that they was welcome to come to our church. Now, I know they put pressure on you and they want you to join, but you don't have to join and you go to church. Don't set at home, go fishing and hunting and things like that on Sunday. We said, "Well, I'm not a legalist." Well, you better be in that manner for a while dishonoring the resurrection. You go to church somewhere. [snorts] &gt;&gt; If I if I went to a certain church that I know, there's only one thing them people ever said that I believe. They said that they believe Jesus was the son of God. They said it. I doubt it, but I'd go to hear them say that. &gt;&gt; That's this church. Maybe the next church would be something like the Baptist. Yeah, I believe you have to have an experience going on. Brother Brandham, um, continuing on uh again, questions answers. Paragraph 213. this minister out there, this fellow down there that wanted to discuss it, that poor brother, he's in such a delusion. [snorts] He said, "Well, brother Brennham," he said, "he's against you Assemblies of God. And if an assembly of minister happens to pick up this tape, I want to tell them uh when was I ever against the Assembly of God men or any other men?" Why is that? when headquarters when your own headquarters admit, "I've sent over three quarters of a million of my children that I've begotten to Christ. Whoa. How I'm against the assemblies of God? Why am I against the oneness? I'm not against no oneness assembly, church of God, or no man. I'm against every system that separates man. &gt;&gt; What's a nickeladian spirit? &gt;&gt; What's it do? What are the fruits of a nickelian spirit? It divides and &gt;&gt; destroys unity. &gt;&gt; Because somebody doesn't see it exactly. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. I'm so far past all of these arguings and disagreements and &gt;&gt; white cloud or white horse. Let's just agree he's coming. &gt;&gt; I'm endeavoring to keep &gt;&gt; the bond of peace by the spirit capital S. &gt;&gt; God get let me have the right spirit. Don't let me be some arrogant proud &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Somebody told somebody here in my church the other day, Brother Ron's a very proud pastor. Well, I'm proud of you guys. I am guilty of that. But about myself. Are you kidding? I don't even think I'm really gifted. I don't think I have I'm not the brightest on the billboard. I'm not an eloquent speaker. I'm just I never asked God to make me a pastor. I do not think above myself, above measure. I pray that I do not give to you the illusion that I'm the only one that I'm the only pastor here in Phoenix. And you know, brother Ram said, I'm the pastor whether it's 1,200 mile radius and all. Oh, stop your quotes. Listen, there's churches within miles of us. Praise God. God, bring more churches that believe this message &gt;&gt; cuz when they do, we're getting out of here. &gt;&gt; That's all I say. God bless every other message minister with your blessings, Lord. But most of all, let us as the ministry give an example that you will follow instead of us getting so arrogant saying we're the only ones and it's us four and no more and we become beaver preachers. &gt;&gt; It's just us. It's our little group. Next thing you know, you can't have anybody who disagrees with you or sees it differently. Now, I'm going to I'm going to say this so that you'll understand. This year, I'm going to bring other ministers that you've never heard preach behind this pulpit. There are no names. They might only have 30 people in their church, but some of them are powerful. And you may say, "Well, Brother Ron, I ain't never heard of them." Well, that's good. Because sometimes God uses a no name, &gt;&gt; huh? Yeah. Amen. Anyway, paragraph 214. Look, I've sent to the assemblies by their own count threequarters of a million of my own children. If they're so bad, why' I do that? Why I think it's the best there is in the land to send them to? Either the one some of the Pentecostal belief because they believe in divine healing. They believe in the supernatural. They believe in the baptism of Holy Ghost. I can't bring them all right here. They're all over the world. I got friends all over the world, children. I've begotten to Christ. And I get them up there and I get them saved. And I said, "Now you GO TO SOME GOOD FULL GOSPEL church and get you a a church home." How many ever heard me say that? Sure. Sure. Why would I send them there then? be a hypocrite to send my own children to death. Far be it from me. If you can't come here to the tabernacle, get to some church somewhere, go to it. [snorts] Trying to do God a service 1965. If I don't believe in going to church, why do I have churches? &gt;&gt; Why did he have Brandom Tabernacle? Why did he tell people to come to church? if he didn't believe in going to churches. Now listen, my own personal testimony was when we came into the message, there were no we didn't come through a message minister, okay? We we just somebody found some tapes and you know the the story and we started listening to tapes and we didn't even know Brother Brenham's name. We thought his name was Jeff from Indiana because on the the cartridge on the side of the tape said Jeff Indiana, short for Jeffersonville. But what we heard on those tapes told us to come out from among them. Be separate, saith God, and touch not every unclean thing. My no man speak like this man. So all of a sudden, hey, bunch of surfers and and druggies and hippies and everything. We We didn't know what to do, where to go. So we start listening to tapes. &gt;&gt; Every time we hear a tape, why you long-haired Ricky? Why you perverted men that got long hair? Why? You're wearing the women's clothes and the women's wearing the men's clothes. Whoa. I'm sitting there in a pair of shorts. He says, "Okay, you might as well call that guy wearing a pair of shorts in the big society." You see what I'm saying? And you longhaired? [snorts] What do you mean? For the first time, I hated getting a haircut my whole life. My dad, a redneck cowboy, you long-haired pervert hippie. So, my dad get haircuts. Oh, I hated it. I hated getting haircut. I love it. Now I fall asleep. They have to They have to wake me up. I wish I had a whole head of hair that it took them 45 minutes to do my hair BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR. I PAY THE SAME price as Robert McGary. It should at least be half price. I only got half a head. See, I ain't trying to be funny. It's just it's rude. So when we heard these tapes of brother Brennham nobody was telling us all of a sudden the conviction come on man. Ah for the first time in my life I can I'm out from my dad's headship and I can grow my hair long. And I told my father I'm going to grow my hair so long I'll walk on it before I cut it. And I meant it. I was rebellious. And then along comes this message. And the next thing you know, I I hear this these long hair and long hair on a man. It's a shame to him. Well, I guess I'm ashamed. Okay. I'm ashamed. Still keep here long, but I'm ashamed. One day, it's just a few weeks after I'd gotten converted and I walked by the mirror, I had long hair, had it to my shoulders, and I had beads around my neck. And I looked into the mirror and I got convicted. Nobody told me. We didn't have a minister. We didn't have, "Hey, I tell you what, long hair, you boys, I'll tell you what. You need to go cut your hair. I'm not here to throw these standards out there. Let the Holy Spirit come. He'll tell you what is long, what is short, what to do. GET THE HOLY GHOST. LET GOD BE YOUR LEADER. I JUST PUT YOU BACK IN REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT HE SAID. &gt;&gt; And I looked in the mirror and I said, "Whoa." And I'll show you a picture maybe someday. I got a picture of Sandy and I I drove all the way to Arizona to come see my girlfriend. Just brought her to the message. Here I am. My hair is still pretty long. Longer than the Beatles when they had their first Yeah. Any of you seen the some of the pictures of the Beatles when they first started out? Just over the years, man. That was long hair. Well, my hair after I cut it was, you know, and I thought I'd really done God a service. Ah, man. God, I have given you my hair. Well, I go to the first meeting after I cut my hair. We're listening to a tape. I got there late like some people do. I got there late. I come in and we're listening to the tape and I went by and I shook everybody's hand and I'm shaking her hand. Nobody said nothing. Nobody shook my hand. Well, God bless you. I went over there and you know what I did? I I went and turned off the tape. Hey, isn't anybody going to congratulate me for cutting my hair? They all looked at me. No, we expected that. Now shut up and sit down and put on the put the tape back on. I thought, "Wow." See, a lot of times you want somebody's recognition for what you've done. You see my long skirt. I expect it. Nobody said, "Hey, praise God. You quit wearing that skin down wiener looking thing and you got a long skirt." Listen, I'm going to ask you, sisters, sisters, I'm appealing to your common sense. The closer you get to God, &gt;&gt; the greater your holiness. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; The greater your holiness will be to God. &gt;&gt; Because you know what? Without holiness, no man shall see God. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not that we sit here and we talk to you young boys and we tell you you long hair. No. Let me tell you, if there's any of you that I feel has long hair, I'll be the first one to say I'm not going to tell you to cut it. I want him to do &gt;&gt; because if I force you, you'll resent me. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, cut my hair. you do will never come back to your church again. All you want is some kind of a standard. See what I'm saying? Rebellion is as the sin of &gt;&gt; witchcraft. So I'm not here. You know what? I have a heart for those that are struggling. &gt;&gt; I do. I have a heart for him. I say God, somebody says, "Brother Ron, somebody came and they this and that and everything." I said, "Let's ask, let's pray that God convict them &gt;&gt; because if we make them our disciples, guess what? Somebody else will come right along and if they've got a more powerful ministry, they will make them their disciples and they'll change their opinion." &gt;&gt; The Okay, boy. I am off of my subject here and it is 12. Brother Ron. [snorts] So what are the several main differences between streaming a service and pressing play? Is there a difference? Vast &gt;&gt; difference. I'll explain a little bit of this right now. They do not believe in five-fold ministry. They believe Brother Brandham is the final voice. And he is the only voice that you hear. And if you press play, that is the token. So in other words, if you stay home and you just press play, that's the evidence you have the token and you're deceived. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because it's not by pressing a button. In fact, God does not ordain mechanical devices. Have you heard that quote? &gt;&gt; You won't hear them say that. God never ordained mechanical devices to preach the gospel. He called, God called, God ordained, God equipped men to take this message. And there's a difference between those that stay home and stream the service because they have a home church, they have a pastor, they couldn't make it versus those who don't want to have a home church, that don't want to have a pastor, don't want to have an accountability, they don't want anybody to rule over them. They can stay home and they can do what they want. And if they want to listen to part of the service, fine. And if they want to go to sleep, they can go to sleep during the service and wake up and say, "I got it." Such deception of the ant. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to try to make everybody see it exactly like me, but we're having spirits. Spirits write on words. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Okay. Yeah. My last quote. Musicians, have you come? I'm getting hungry. [snorts] Not really. I just said that. I shouldn't lie from the pulpit here. Brother Ron, don't do that. Christ the mystery of God revealed. Now you got tapes on that. You got tapes on what we believe. You got tapes on discipline in the church. How we behave ourselves in the church of God. How we got to come here together to sit together in heavenly places. Don't stay home. If God's in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in there to fellowship with your brothers. If you don't feel that way, then I tell you, it's time you got to praying. Cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exalted or exhorted us to much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves togetherelves together in heavenly places in [music] Christ Jesus. Love one another. This will all men know you are my disciples when you have one love one for another. That's right. Stay right together. Brother Ram said, "Don't be clanish. I spoke to brother Joseph Brandham about this directly one on one. He came through town with the uh Voice of God tour years ago. Brother Joseph Dalton and Jim Dalton asked me if I would go to the meeting with them. So, they rented a a building downtown here in Phoenix. So, I went [snorts] and Joseph had just put out a booklet called Here I [music] Stand. Any of you remember Here I Stand? You remember him standing there with his Bible? Here I stand. It became the most divisive division causing element within the message at that very moment because now it was tapes only and five-fold ministry. So which is it? I want to ask you. I want to ask you, my church, do I believe in listening to tapes? &gt;&gt; Do I try to propagate this ministry of the prophet rather than my own? &gt;&gt; Why do I put quotes up here? Why do I show you? Because I'm just not paraphrasing. I want you to see what he said. I believe in listening to tapes. I listen to tapes. I try to every day and and when I hear it, I I'm thrilled. It's it's like hearing the tape for the first time. See, there there's a doctrine permeating right among our own church. That's the reason that these questions arise. And so, I need to address them. Because the only time we can get a bunch of message believers together is for a funeral or a wedding. Not for a gospel meeting. Oh, hey Bob. Haven't seen you. It's 10 [music] 10 years ago. Yeah. We used to go to church together. Yeah. Well, Uncle so and so died and we're here and Yeah, man. Hey, you doing okay? Yeah, we're all right. But you ain't had fellowship. Why? Because now you think differently. You believe a little bit differently until there's no fellowship. And the devil loves that you don't have fellowship with anyone else outside of your little group. And you might [music] be missing one of the greatest blessings that because you're so you're you're you got these blinders on. It's us and we're the only one. We're the elect and stay here and I'm your pastor and you can't go somewhere else. Listen, everybody in my church is happy. They're either happy to come or they're happy to go. I do not hold you. &gt;&gt; That's right. Here's a let me make something else clear to you. We have visitors. Brother Robert, I want you to greet visitors. They're here from here and there. And I I've told Amos and Brother Pierre and you brethren, you deacons that stand at the door. If we've got visitors and we haven't seen them, their name, where are they from? Oh, you're from Canada. You're this, that, you're uh so and so. And then you greet them and and stuff because I don't have time to be up here. Oh, brother so and so. Oh, oh, yeah, you go. Oh, you're up here and God bless you. We'd sure love to have you at our church. We're so glad you're you're here. I'm not a procellator. And I don't sit here and welcome everybody into such a a a degree because you know what? They might just be visiting. Well, I'm not trying to pull them into our church. Do you understand that? I'm not. But I do think that we ought to be a very welcoming [music] church. &gt;&gt; It would be horrible for new visitors to come and visit with us and none of you shake their hand and make them feel welcome. &gt;&gt; Terrible. [music] Why? If brother Robert doesn't tell you to stand up and turn around, shake one another's hand, some of you are you're resurrected when we say you are dismissed and you run to your car and get in your car and you're gone and you don't shake anybody's hand and God bless you. How are you? Have love one for another. How are you doing? There's some of you that I don't get to see because I go out of the church on this side. I think I'm going to start parking over here cuz there's half of those people. [laughter] We We get set in our ways, don't we? Some of you Congalles believers, I don't know your first and last name. And you've been coming here for years. I am Sorry, I want to know you. Some of you, you you you don't speak much English. Jean Pierre, he's come here to the Baya family. You know how proud I am of the Bay family. And hey, it's getting bigger. More more people. I don't have an opportunity to share with brother Jean Pierre because I don't speak French. Every time we visit, he speaks a little bit of English, I know a little bit of French. And so beyond just a few words, it stops. So unless I can speak to him through a translator, our fellowship can only go so far. But I appreciate it that when he comes, he comes here and he has to sit with a and I don't know who it is that's translating back there right now. Might be Emanuel or somebody. But &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; um many of you I don't know you on a firstname basis. And for that I'm sorry. I want to be a good pastor. I want to get to know you. I'd love to have everybody come over to my house but I can't do that. I try to have groups at a time rather than just one or two. I do the wife, bless her heart, I'll we get 20 25 people to come to our house, you know, and it's not so easy as it is just one or two couples. I've had Sam and Tiffany come in [music] town for months. I never get to take him to lunch. I'm sorry. I I'd love to say, "Hey, let's just go. I've got others from Canada. Samuel, you and Marina, [music] I don't get to visit with you guys very often. You think I take it lightly that you [music] come? Hey, Tim Robel, you think I take it lightly when I see you sitting on the back row over there? You think that I don't notice that you're there? You and Gabby and your kids. I'd love to take you all to lunch. I can't do it. So, Johnny Green will do it for me. [laughter] I see pictures. He's got a selfie and there's 20 or 30 people. They send it to me. I said, "God bless you, brother Johnny. That guy's good [music] stuff." Anyway, all of you I told Joel Franklin the other day, "Hey, brother Joel, you know what I'd like to do? I'd like to take some of these young men." I said, "Let's go to a ball game." And I said, "You and Amos just kind of figure out a time." I said, "Now, I'm not going to take all of the every one of you young guy because a lot of you guys, you know, you could care less go. You just would like to have a free meal and some something to do." Did I tell you that, Brother Joe? I said, because you know what? Let's sit down and talk about something you're interested in. Maybe you know the names of the all of the good baseball players and you know the name of the team and and this guy's batting average and his statistics and all of that stuff. I I don't know it, but you know what? I'll go there and I'll sit with you and you know what? I I watch a game even when I go to the when the brothers play and John Dubsky and I and different ones sit behind the plate and everything. I'm watching the game. All right. Come on, ISRAEL. KNOCK THAT THE YEAH, BUDDY. COME ON, JAMES. Knock it out of the park. [screaming] Yeah. Because whatsoever you do, do it with your whole heart. Do it with a passion. One thing about it, whatever you do in life, if you'll do it with a passion, you'll succeed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, take a few of these guys, go with them, sit down, talk to them, visit with them. I used to be our youth leader for years and I knew every one of my young people. I knew their names. I I don't know all their names now. We got I'm just sharing you my heart this morning. Okay. This is as anointed as what I was on watch night. It's just a different anointing. Okay. I love you people and I'm I love you with a godly jealousy and I want to watch over you [music] and I want to protect you as best that I can and therefore when different ones ask these questions. Well, what about what's wrong? What's the difference between streaming and and and [music] those that uh stay home and press play? There's a vast difference. And I don't need to show you and tell you everything that's wrong about it. You need to get on your face before God and ask God to show you and then you find a church that you should be going into because the devil will divide you and conquer you and to just show you that those who only press play, invite them to come to church with you one time. See if they'll come in. Ain't no way. Ain't that we don't believe in that? You don't believe in what? Brother Bram said, "Will the would the bride of Christ have a ministry before the coming of the Lord?" &gt;&gt; Oh, no, no, no, no. It's just Brother Brennham. Just Brother Brennham. He's the only voice. He's the last voice. He's the final. Wait just a second. Have you did Did you keep reading? Did you keep listening? Or did you stop right there? I just say keep on. That's why I put you back in remembrance of what he said. Okay. Is this okay? I I I've held you. It's almost [music] uh 12:45. Wow. &gt;&gt; And thank you. [music] Thank you, Brian. Thank you for being here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's okay. I've got 11 pages of notes right here. I never even touched. It's actually 12 pages, but the several pages that I had, I wanted to go over and kind of go over it slowly and visit with you. Is this okay? &gt;&gt; I I trust it is. And I I pray that I have the right attitude. I'm not going after anybody. I'm not I'm not I'm not God knows my heart. But there are spirits in this end time that are trying to deceive the people. Brother Brandham said, "I've got people I've got 15 or 20 people sitting right here in my church right now that believe I'm Jesus Christ." How many of them heard him say that? And he says, "How could they do that?" He says, "Why?" He said, "Of all the things that's ever come up in my own ministry," he said, "I'm I'm leaving the ministry." He said, "It's Antichrist spirit." And he said, "If this would have been my enemy, I would have laughed." But he said, "Some of these are my best friends, and they're sitting right there looking at him." And I'll tell you what, in a church of about 150 people and you got 15 or [music] 20 people sitting right there, don't you think those people knew who the he was talking about? Yeah, absolutely, brother. Yeah, because he tells me Brother Bram's God. We baptized in Brother Bram's name. He's the new name of God. William Brandham on and on all these doctrines and different things. And brother Bram said, "I'd rather face God as a quitter than as an antichrist." He said, "All these years of ministry down the devil's [snorts] gutterpipe." He said, "It's an antichrist spirit. Don't you give heed to it. Don't you listen to it. You You go to church. You can't wait for those doors." Is this what he said? These are his doctrinal teachings. He said, "If I didn't believe in going to church, why would I have one?" Come on. That's common sense. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. God bless you. Let's stand together this morning. And why don't you just before we leave, I'm not going to wait for Robert to do it. I'm going to tell you, turn around and shake somebody's hand. And if you don't know them, say, "We are so glad you came to church today and God bless you. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. You guys are even smiling. Wow. That's it. Smile. Be friendly. Show yourselves friendly. Invite somebody to to to lunch today.
