[37:52] to be able to be in this battle with
[37:54] each and every one of you and good to
[37:56] see you fight in the right Ty it's good
[37:58] to see you my
[38:00] friend amen so just before I sing this
[38:04] song this morning it was just thinking
[38:06] of a few thoughts came along with it and
[38:09] it so easy for us it's a Temptation that
[38:12] we have that
[38:13] are walking in the light of our day to
[38:16] to have the attitude that
[38:19] we're better than others we're the
[38:21] called out of the called out of the
[38:23] called out and but we've seen our name
[38:25] in the book we know who we are but you
[38:27] know John saw his name in the book and
[38:29] he came back after being the AIS of and
[38:32] he said let us love one
[38:34] another Paul taught us that love was
[38:39] didn't VA itself it was not puffed
[38:42] up and just along those lines a couple
[38:46] of examples I just wanted to to share I
[38:48] remember brother brandom talking about
[38:50] you know if you you get to heaven before
[38:52] I do he says one morning you wake up and
[38:55] say you may hear somebody down a little
[38:56] cabin
[38:58] on the back porch just singing Amazing
[39:00] Grace they say well brother Brandon made
[39:03] it and just that humility that he had
[39:05] not you know I'm going to have a big
[39:07] mansion myself but even with that you
[39:10] know you come down and see me I'll just
[39:12] be happy I made it amen and I think
[39:15] that's each of our thoughts this morning
[39:17] and then also just thinking of that
[39:20] example that our Prophet shared with us
[39:23] of the the man who owned the ranch in
[39:27] col
[39:28] and his son came out there looking for a
[39:31] a wife and he saw the one that didn't
[39:35] have the character that her cousins had
[39:38] in a good way she
[39:40] didn't but when her attitude wasn't you
[39:44] know look at me I'm the one that was
[39:46] chosen it was like I'm I'm not
[39:49] worthy and I just I so appreciate that
[39:52] and so this song that want to sing for
[39:55] you this
[39:56] morning
[40:00] [Music]
[40:03] just another thought that goes along
[40:05] with
[40:08] that and Jesus himself
[40:11] was a t having any conversation with his
[40:15] disciples Bram said one cold rainy night
[40:17] they said to him Master we'll go home
[40:19] with you he said the foxes have holes
[40:21] the birds have nests but I don't even
[40:24] have a place to lay my
[40:26] head say said god Jehovah humbled
[40:29] himself and became a man represented in
[40:32] sinful flesh to redeem you and me who
[40:36] are we
[40:37] then he was our
[40:40] example who am I nothing yes and so I
[40:46] just wanted to share that before we sang
[40:50] this song for you this
[40:55] morning well when I think
[40:58] think of how he
[41:01] came so far from
[41:08] Glory he came to
[41:10] dwell among the
[41:14] lon such as
[41:19] I to suffer
[41:23] shame and such
[41:26] disgrace
[41:28] on Mount
[41:30] calary take my
[41:34] place then I ask
[41:38] myself this
[41:41] question who am
[41:46] I oh who am
[41:50] I
[41:51] that
[41:54] king would bleed and die for
[42:01] who am I that he would
[42:06] say not my will thine
[42:11] for oh the answer
[42:16] I may never
[42:20] know why he
[42:22] ever loved me
[42:26] so
[42:27] and to an Old Rugged Cross he'd
[42:33] go for who am
[42:37] [Music]
[42:40] I and then I'm
[42:44] reminded of his
[42:47] words I'll leave you
[42:53] never so just be true
[42:58] I'll give to
[43:00] you life
[43:04] forever and
[43:07] forever I wonder
[43:10] what I could have
[43:13] done to
[43:17] deserve God's only
[43:20] son he'll fight my
[43:23] battles until they're one
[43:28] for who am
[43:30] I would you sing it with me this morning
[43:33] oh who am
[43:37] I that a king would bleed and die
[43:46] for oh who am
[43:50] I that he would
[43:54] sing not my will thine
[44:00] for the answer
[44:04] I may never
[44:07] know just why he
[44:10] ever Lov me
[44:14] so that to an Old Rugged Cross he'd
[44:21] gone yes to an Old Rugged Cross he'd go
[44:27] oh wo to an Old Rugged Cross he'
[44:34] go for who am

[58:12] that has touched every one of your

[58:20] pray that at some time you will meet
[58:23] him and you will wrestle with him even
[58:26] as Jacob did and that's when his life
[58:30] was changed not by hearing the
[58:33] stories wonderful sit on the lap of his
[58:36] grandfather Abraham and his father Isaac
[58:40] and go ahead and hear all the stories
[58:42] and what it was like to be in the great
[58:43] meetings and to see God and mzc and on
[58:46] and on and on but it never changed Jacob
[58:52] right but there come a time yes on
[58:57] remember God keeps all his
[58:59] appointments there came a time when he
[59:02] was left alone you know saints of God
[59:04] there uh there are times in your life
[59:07] when God wants you alone yes that's true
[59:11] you can be in a whole crowd of people
[59:14] and be
[59:16] alone and when God gets you alone and it
[59:19] was there that when he was alone and he
[59:22] laid down didn't even really recognize
[59:24] that God was there and put his head up
[59:27] upon a stone as a pillow and God began
[59:30] to deal with
[59:32] him he woke up he said oh what a awesome
[59:36] place this is this is none other than
[59:39] the house of God and I pray that even as
[59:43] Jacob said this is the house of God and
[59:45] he recognized that something
[59:47] Supernatural was happening yeah sir I

[1:00:43] answer in your own life I thank God that

[1:01:32] then we'll go to Genesis
[1:01:34] 3 and I want to see because we've been
[1:01:36] talking about
[1:01:38] the ministry of the son of
[1:01:41] man and I want to because it's all
[1:01:45] wrapped around something that's called
[1:01:48] The Book of
[1:01:51] redemption what is this
[1:01:54] book who holds it what's in
[1:02:00] it Genesis 2:
[1:02:08] 7-9 and in Genesis chapter 2 I want you
[1:02:12] to
[1:02:13] notice those of you that are Bible
[1:02:18] students that from Genesis one up until
[1:02:21] two everything that God did he created
[1:02:23] and God said and God did and God said
[1:02:26] and God said but brother Brenham said he
[1:02:29] changed his
[1:02:32] name from God said to the Lord
[1:02:36] God he was wanting to show his Plan of
[1:02:39] Redemption with man his Affinity with
[1:02:42] man so from then on it's no more and God
[1:02:45] said and God said you'll find out every
[1:02:48] verse now and the Lord God and the Lord
[1:02:50] God isn't that
[1:02:52] wonderful how much he loves us and the
[1:02:56] Lord God formed a man of the Dust of the
[1:02:58] ground and breathed into his nostrils a
[1:03:01] breath of life and Man became a living
[1:03:06] Soul the Lord God planted a garden
[1:03:09] Eastward in
[1:03:10] Eden and there he put the man whom he
[1:03:14] had formed amen and out of the ground
[1:03:17] made the Lord God to grow every tree
[1:03:20] that is Pleasant to the sight and good
[1:03:22] for
[1:03:24] food the tree of life also in the midst
[1:03:28] of the
[1:03:29] garden and the tree of
[1:03:31] knowledge of Good and
[1:03:33] Evil verse
[1:03:36] 15 and the Lord God took the man and put
[1:03:39] him into the Garden of Eden to dress it
[1:03:42] and to keep
[1:03:44] it notice he had a job before he had a
[1:03:53] wife the Lord God commanded the man
[1:03:57] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[1:03:59] must mayest freely eat but of the
[1:04:04] tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:04:07] Thou shalt not eat of
[1:04:09] it for in the day that thou eatest
[1:04:12] thereof Thou shalt surely die what a
[1:04:19] warning he said look everything here
[1:04:22] every
[1:04:23] tree and brother Bram said watch those
[1:04:25] two trees in the garden the tree of life
[1:04:29] and the tree of
[1:04:30] knowledge and he said cuz that tree and
[1:04:34] those two seeds are going to intertwine
[1:04:36] they're going to go all the way from
[1:04:38] Genesis to
[1:04:40] Revelation Genesis 3: 22- 24 and the
[1:04:46] Lord God said behold the man is as one
[1:04:48] of
[1:04:49] us to know good and
[1:04:53] evil and now lest he put forth for his
[1:04:56] hand and take also of the tree of life
[1:04:58] and eat and live
[1:04:59] [Applause]
[1:05:00] forever therefore the L the Lord God
[1:05:03] sent him forth from the Garden of
[1:05:07] Eden and to till the ground from whence
[1:05:09] he was
[1:05:11] taken and so he drove out the man
[1:05:14] brother brandham said one of
[1:05:18] the heartbreaking portions of
[1:05:22] scripture that God is driving his own
[1:05:24] son out of
[1:05:26] Eden
[1:05:31] on and he placed at the east of the
[1:05:34] Garden of Eden
[1:05:37] cherums and a flaming sword which turned
[1:05:40] every way to keep the way of the tree of
[1:05:44] life it was there they were supposed to
[1:05:48] eat of
[1:05:50] it and now it's guarded
[1:05:54] yep L they eat of the Tree of Life in a
[1:05:57] fallen
[1:05:59] State and forever would be in that
[1:06:03] position yet God knew what to do yes he
[1:06:06] did Heavenly Father Lord as we have read
[1:06:08] your word this
[1:06:10] morning and Lord there was so much that
[1:06:13] uh you were just showing me yesterday
[1:06:15] and I got into a a place where father I
[1:06:19] didn't know in which direction to
[1:06:22] go and therefore I humbled myself before
[1:06:25] you and I said oh Father thou has given
[1:06:28] me the thought but accept that you take
[1:06:30] it now and add to it
[1:06:34] Lord I'm in a confused State and
[1:06:38] confusions of the devil so therefore
[1:06:41] father as thy son I ask show me thy way
[1:06:45] oh God and what you would have me to say
[1:06:48] to thy people that your people would be
[1:06:52] blessed and I thank you Lord that you
[1:06:55] came came by and you came and you spoke
[1:06:58] to my heart and I pray now father let
[1:07:01] that which has been put into my heart be
[1:07:04] placed upon theirs yes Lord we ask it
[1:07:08] For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name
[1:07:11] amen God bless you you may be seated
[1:07:13] this morning in the presence of the
[1:07:16] Lord hallelujah
[1:07:20] hallelujah so the tree of life was
[1:07:23] protected away from God's
[1:07:28] children lest they eat of that tree and
[1:07:31] live forever in a fallen
[1:07:33] State now this morning I want to title
[1:07:37] my
[1:07:38] sermon the seven sealed book of
[1:07:44] redemption and I want to take a subject
[1:07:46] this morning as the abstract the
[1:07:49] abstract title
[1:07:51] deed the second part to Redemption am
[1:07:59] amen and I'd like to go into a little
[1:08:02] bit greater detail what does it mean to
[1:08:04] have an abstract tile
[1:08:07] deed I lived in flagdale for about 13
[1:08:12] years all three of our children were
[1:08:14] born there
[1:08:15] and we worked there and
[1:08:18] I got my real estate license there and
[1:08:21] sold real estate for 3 years with
[1:08:25] brother
[1:08:27] Robson and um I learned some things in
[1:08:31] getting my real estate license that
[1:08:33] every time a piece of property is sold
[1:08:36] you have to buy Title Insurance any of
[1:08:39] you bought a home piece of property you
[1:08:41] have Title Insurance well what's Title
[1:08:44] Insurance why do I need
[1:08:46] it well you want to make sure that
[1:08:49] there's no leans or an encumbrance or
[1:08:53] somebody that lays claim oh no I own
[1:08:55] that property hey that guy sold it to me
[1:08:58] whatever so you pay for somebody to
[1:09:01] legally to go search the title to find
[1:09:04] out does anybody say that they've got
[1:09:07] legal right or an incumbrance on that
[1:09:13] property and every piece of property has
[1:09:17] what they call a legal
[1:09:19] description because you have to have a
[1:09:21] point of
[1:09:22] beginning right and you know that God
[1:09:25] does that within his
[1:09:28] word he tells you he told the children
[1:09:31] of
[1:09:32] Israel from the River Jordan over to
[1:09:36] Mount Si over to this and he goes and
[1:09:40] that is what is called uh a meets and
[1:09:44] Bounds description from this big rock
[1:09:47] over to that big tree so many meters
[1:09:50] this and that because they didn't you
[1:09:52] know back then uh they didn't have the
[1:09:55] longitude and latitude that we have
[1:09:58] today but if any of you buy a piece of
[1:10:01] property it'll say and this is the point
[1:10:03] of
[1:10:05] beginning and so from this point of
[1:10:07] beginning it'll tell you northward
[1:10:10] Southward whatever you go so many meters
[1:10:13] stop that is a point of
[1:10:15] reference that is what when you all have
[1:10:18] a property surveyed the surveyor will
[1:10:22] set your boundary
[1:10:23] Corners everybody want wants to know
[1:10:26] what's mine I don't want my neighbor
[1:10:27] encroaching on my property if I'm going
[1:10:29] to build a wall I want to build it right
[1:10:31] where I should I want to know my how
[1:10:34] many of you are interested in your
[1:10:36] property boundaries because what's yours
[1:10:40] you
[1:10:41] want
[1:10:46] amen so it has a point of a beginning
[1:10:48] and then it must come back to that point
[1:10:50] of beginning Alpha must come back to
[1:10:53] Omega amen
[1:10:59] so you have this title
[1:11:03] insurance somebody in the title company
[1:11:05] now researches is
[1:11:08] out and looks if there is a cloud on the
[1:11:12] title that means there's an encumbrance
[1:11:15] there's an issue there's an abnormality
[1:11:17] ho hold it you can't buy this property
[1:11:21] till we clean up the
[1:11:24] title and an abstract title is a written
[1:11:28] record this I got right off of uh the
[1:11:33] dictionary that details a property's
[1:11:36] complete legal
[1:11:38] history from its first
[1:11:41] recording of
[1:11:43] ownership to present day I thought
[1:11:47] that's pretty
[1:11:48] good an abstract title details every
[1:11:52] title transfer and previous owner as
[1:11:55] well as any leans or other legal actions
[1:11:58] against the
[1:12:01] property now brother
[1:12:03] Brenham describes this so much of the
[1:12:06] time and he tells us that we've got to
[1:12:11] go back to the abstract title deed and
[1:12:13] he said what Adam lost in the beginning
[1:12:15] has got to be
[1:12:20] returned and it
[1:12:22] all is tied together
[1:12:26] with an abstract title
[1:12:29] beat the blood of the Lamb that was shed
[1:12:32] at Calvary paid the price for every lean
[1:12:35] that was on the
[1:12:36] property every
[1:12:39] sin everything that you ever did he paid
[1:12:42] the price somebody say Amen that ought
[1:12:45] to make you
[1:12:47] happy honestly it ought to make every
[1:12:50] one of you in your heart say thank
[1:12:53] God and I have an advocate before the
[1:12:57] father who therefore can lay any
[1:13:00] charge to God's
[1:13:03] elect prise the Lord so this book of
[1:13:07] redemption is called the legal history
[1:13:11] going all the way back to the original
[1:13:17] owner
[1:13:18] now Jesus came to seek and to save that
[1:13:22] which was lost amen
[1:13:27] you understand that now you can't claim
[1:13:31] something that was yours unless you
[1:13:33] owned it before you lost
[1:13:37] it that's
[1:13:40] right so he's not saving those that are
[1:13:42] not
[1:13:44] his I come to seek and to save my
[1:13:49] sheep those who have lost their position
[1:13:53] those who have lost their inheritance I
[1:13:55] came to seek and to save and return them
[1:13:59] back and I'm going to be your kinsman
[1:14:01] redeemer and I'm going to lay my life
[1:14:03] down I'm going to pay the price and the
[1:14:06] case is
[1:14:08] dismissed amen but there's two parts to
[1:14:11] Redemption
[1:14:13] right Calvary paid the
[1:14:16] price but what happened to the
[1:14:21] book Adam lost
[1:14:24] it listen to his
[1:14:29] wife brother Brenan picks this up in the
[1:14:32] sermon the breach between the seven
[1:14:34] Church ages and the Seven Seals so now
[1:14:37] he's he's coming into this gap
[1:14:41] between what is happening between the
[1:14:43] seven Church ages and the opening of the
[1:14:47] seals now the forfeited title deed is
[1:14:51] now in the hands of the original owner
[1:14:55] almighty
[1:14:56] God the title deed to the Earth and to
[1:15:00] eternal life when Adam forfeited it then
[1:15:04] Satan dirty's hands could not take it so
[1:15:08] it went back to its original owner God
[1:15:12] himself we're going to find that out in
[1:15:14] a
[1:15:15] minute there he sits on the throne with
[1:15:18] it in his hand is this bringing anything
[1:15:21] up to your mind right now of him who sat
[1:15:24] on the throne and he had a a book
[1:15:27] sealed it was in his hand I want you to
[1:15:31] understand if we don't have the seven
[1:15:34] sealed book of redemption the second
[1:15:37] part to Redemption there's two parts to
[1:15:39] Redemption coming out and going
[1:15:42] into you will find out how absolutely
[1:15:46] important it is there would be no
[1:15:49] Redemption without the opening of those
[1:15:52] seals why because he is the
[1:15:55] [Applause]
[1:15:58] Hallelujah except that he died and the
[1:16:02] corner wheat except it be be planted and
[1:16:06] died it abideth
[1:16:08] alone oh if Satan would have only known
[1:16:11] what he uh had planned that corn of
[1:16:16] wheat had to Die the vessel had to be
[1:16:18] broken open brother Brenham said there
[1:16:21] was that seed hanging and he says and
[1:16:25] what they did water blood spirit
[1:16:28] constitutes a birth and there it
[1:16:31] was out of his side went water and blood
[1:16:35] and he cried and his Spirit left
[1:16:38] him water blood spirit shows a birth you
[1:16:43] know what God was doing spilling his
[1:16:45] seed the Bible says that his seed was in
[1:16:49] his soul and he poured out his soul unto
[1:16:52] death and there the whole new testament
[1:16:56] church every one the elect seed were
[1:17:00] spilled out upon the Earth God thought
[1:17:03] he he he had solved the problem excuse
[1:17:07] me Satan thought he had got him I've got
[1:17:09] him as long as I can keep him three
[1:17:12] days that's all I got to do it's over
[1:17:15] it's finished no more Messiah no one
[1:17:18] because no one's worthy to take the
[1:17:22] book Thank You Lord
[1:17:28] on and there he sits on the throne with
[1:17:31] it in his hand and when Adam forfeited
[1:17:34] it for wisdom instead of
[1:17:37] faith it went back to the hands of the
[1:17:40] original owner almighty God what a great
[1:17:43] thing what's it doing in the hands of
[1:17:45] God waiting for Redemption
[1:17:49] claims what is that book in his hand
[1:17:52] it's a seven sealed book of
[1:17:56] redemption he made a way of redemption
[1:17:59] he made a way back and someday the
[1:18:02] Redeemer is to take it
[1:18:05] back I don't want to get ahead of myself
[1:18:07] but what does brother Bram say is
[1:18:09] written in the book he said the names of
[1:18:13] the elect those
[1:18:16] redeemed he said and when he comes he
[1:18:19] comes to take the
[1:18:21] names Hallelujah do you understand what
[1:18:24] he's
[1:18:26] all of those whose names are written in
[1:18:29] the Lamb's Book of Life and that book of
[1:18:32] redemption he's coming to claim which is
[1:18:38] his oh what a happening what an
[1:18:44] event no wonder brother Brenham had to
[1:18:47] wait and get
[1:18:49] alone he had to cut himself off from all
[1:18:54] of people and distractions and get alone
[1:18:58] and pray oh I don't know what these
[1:19:00] seals hold I went back and looked at my
[1:19:03] notes and how I preached the first
[1:19:06] several seals in about 20 minutes and oh
[1:19:10] he he looked at Clarence lar and he
[1:19:12] looked at hislop's Two Babylons he
[1:19:15] looked at all of these
[1:19:17] writings and now he's getting
[1:19:20] Alone come on he is now getting alone
[1:19:24] with God
[1:19:25] oh God I'm depending on you for that
[1:19:29] first seal amen hallelujah do you
[1:19:36] understand my brother my sister God
[1:19:38] shows it in the heavens before it
[1:19:41] happens on Earth amen amen he is to meet
[1:19:45] with seven Mighty Angels he's caught up
[1:19:48] into a constellation what is God doing
[1:19:52] he's absolutely taking his
[1:19:55] Prophet yeah and programming him to be
[1:20:00] prepared to meet but now he's caught up
[1:20:03] supernaturally do you understand those
[1:20:07] of you that recently went to Sunset
[1:20:11] Mountain it's a location there's nothing
[1:20:14] special about the location other than
[1:20:17] the fact that God had his Prophet there
[1:20:20] for a
[1:20:23] reason on there he says a clap came down
[1:20:26] from
[1:20:28] heaven he says run
[1:20:32] hide quick get under
[1:20:35] cover there blast came down picked him
[1:20:39] up do you realize he took off his
[1:20:43] hat and he said there he was caught up
[1:20:45] into a constellation of seven angels
[1:20:49] Wings swept back Mighty Angels coming
[1:20:52] from
[1:20:53] eternity
[1:20:57] he said I look to those
[1:20:59] angels He said but the seventh
[1:21:04] [Music]
[1:21:07] one saints of God this message is more
[1:21:13] than Church
[1:21:16] ORD it is God fulfilling scripture Amen
[1:21:20] Let me just go
[1:21:23] on
[1:21:25] in the breach again paragraph
[1:21:27] 118 what is this book of
[1:21:30] redemption this title deed Abstract
[1:21:33] title deed you say
[1:21:36] abstract what does an abstract mean
[1:21:38] means it searched all the way back to
[1:21:41] its
[1:21:42] beginning don't you like
[1:21:44] that listen this Prophet did not go to
[1:21:48] Genesis one in the
[1:21:51] beginning he went
[1:21:53] beyond he said I'm going to go beyond
[1:21:56] the beginning I'm going to go back to
[1:21:58] where this whole thing began to evolve
[1:22:02] and where was it
[1:22:04] evolving
[1:22:06] remember that you have a mind and the
[1:22:10] mind is called the
[1:22:13] womb to the
[1:22:15] soul and here God in his great mind he
[1:22:19] was an eternal being he was a
[1:22:23] spirit there was no
[1:22:26] Angels there was nothing to worship him
[1:22:29] and he began to
[1:22:31] think and his thoughts because he's
[1:22:34] Eternal his thoughts are
[1:22:36] Eternal and there he began to develop in
[1:22:39] his
[1:22:40] mind it was the developing place let me
[1:22:43] tell you what God was doing am he was
[1:22:46] developing
[1:22:48] you for a time and a season he knew he
[1:22:52] took from your great grandfather father
[1:22:54] and your grandfather and your father and
[1:22:56] he took this and this and this and
[1:22:58] everything and you are not a mistake you
[1:23:01] came down here and God designed you
[1:23:03] exactly as you
[1:23:06] are with every problem with every
[1:23:09] complex and yet God still loves
[1:23:12] you somebody ought to say
[1:23:15] hallelujah he
[1:23:17] knew me and my challenges he knew my
[1:23:20] complexes he knew my failures he knew my
[1:23:23] faults and while I was yet a
[1:23:26] sinner Christ died for me Hallelujah it
[1:23:30] wasn't my works it wasn't my the things
[1:23:33] that I'm going to do right or wrong that
[1:23:36] had nothing to do with it he said by
[1:23:38] election I've called you there in back
[1:23:42] of my mind I'm going to go beyond
[1:23:44] Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created
[1:23:47] I'm going to go beyond Genesis one I'm
[1:23:50] going to go when he wasn't even God come
[1:23:54] on and there he began to think these
[1:23:59] thoughts a
[1:24:02] thought unless it's spoken is never
[1:24:06] manifested but when a thought is
[1:24:10] spoken on the lips of
[1:24:13] deity it
[1:24:15] becomes a manifestation and God thoughts
[1:24:19] about
[1:24:22] light and he says there in his mind the
[1:24:25] prophet said oh he was thinking the
[1:24:28] properties of light and what it'll do
[1:24:30] and it'll be a separation from
[1:24:33] Darkness but said there it just stayed
[1:24:36] as a thought until he said let there be
[1:24:40] light Thank you
[1:24:45] lord and there was light
[1:24:51] yes the power of the SP spoken
[1:24:55] word somebody say
[1:24:59] amen and When sin has been
[1:25:03] confessed and fallen into the blood of
[1:25:05] Jesus Christ oh my it gives an
[1:25:09] abstract right straight back to the
[1:25:12] Creator
[1:25:13] again and you become a Son of God
[1:25:16] Abstract title deed is held in the hand
[1:25:18] of the almighty oh
[1:25:21] my thank you Lord now we all know that
[1:25:24] the prophet of God taught many times
[1:25:27] that Redemption has two
[1:25:30] parts there is a coming out and a going
[1:25:34] into the laws of redemption are not
[1:25:37] complete unless you have both amen you
[1:25:41] can come out and not go in too
[1:25:46] right it's not just coming out of
[1:25:48] denomination but it's going into the
[1:25:51] Promised word of the
[1:25:52] hour how many believers do you know that
[1:25:55] are just satisfied oh praise God I come
[1:25:58] out of that old Harlot system but have
[1:26:01] you gone into the message of the hour I
[1:26:05] don't want to just talk about it I want
[1:26:08] to experience it I want the message in
[1:26:12] me because the message is
[1:26:15] [Applause]
[1:26:23] Christ
[1:26:27] I want to show you because we know types
[1:26:29] and shadows through scripture First
[1:26:31] Corinthians 10 veres
[1:26:35] 1-2 moreover Brethren I wouldn't that
[1:26:38] you should not be ignorant how that all
[1:26:41] our
[1:26:42] fathers were under the cloud and all
[1:26:44] passed through the
[1:26:46] sea all baptized unto Moses in the cloud
[1:26:50] and the
[1:26:51] Sea now we know Moses never baptized
[1:26:55] ized but there's an
[1:26:59] anointing John said I baptize you surely
[1:27:02] with water but there's one coming after
[1:27:05] me whose baptism is far
[1:27:07] greater so and did eat all and all did
[1:27:12] eat of the same spiritual
[1:27:16] meat did drink the same spiritual drink
[1:27:20] for they drank of that spiritual rock
[1:27:23] that followed them and that rock was
[1:27:27] Christ
[1:27:28] Christ that
[1:27:32] anointing but many of them God was not
[1:27:35] well pleased for they were overthrown in
[1:27:38] the wilderness now these things were our
[1:27:42] examples to the intent that we should
[1:27:44] not lust after evil things as they also
[1:27:47] lusted neither be
[1:27:50] idolators as were some of them as it is
[1:27:53] written the people sat down to eat drink
[1:27:55] and Rose up to
[1:27:58] play neither let us commit
[1:28:01] fornication as some of them committed
[1:28:04] and fell in one day 3 and 20,000 people
[1:28:08] one
[1:28:10] day brother R says how does a church or
[1:28:14] a people commit
[1:28:17] adultery on Christ the word he said when
[1:28:20] you knowing better by the Intercourse of
[1:28:22] the mind yeah
[1:28:25] add to take away from the word of God
[1:28:28] you're absolutely committing spiritual
[1:28:30] adultery on Christ the
[1:28:32] word and you think that God's going to
[1:28:35] allow neither fornicators nor adulterers
[1:28:38] nor a feminine those that love a lie are
[1:28:42] not going to make Heaven their home
[1:28:43] don't think you can play around with
[1:28:45] this message don't you add to it don't
[1:28:47] you take away from it I'm not interested
[1:28:50] in your opinion I want to know God's
[1:28:52] opinion and God's Prophet gave us God's
[1:28:57] opinion
[1:28:59] amen
[1:29:02] hallelujah neither let us tempt Christ
[1:29:06] of some of them tempted were destroyed
[1:29:08] of serpents neither murmur ye as some of
[1:29:12] them also murmured when destroyed to the
[1:29:15] Destroyer now all these things happened
[1:29:17] unto them for in
[1:29:20] samples as they as they are written for
[1:29:23] our
[1:29:24] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[1:29:27] world are
[1:29:30] come whom the ends of the world we're
[1:29:33] we're there are we not this is it this
[1:29:36] is lot you seea there's not going to be
[1:29:37] another church age he said don't worry
[1:29:41] about historians having to write down
[1:29:43] what's going on now he said there'll not
[1:29:44] be another group to read
[1:29:49] it
[1:29:53] amen written for our admonition upon the
[1:29:56] whom the ends of the world are come
[1:29:58] wherefore let him that thinketh he
[1:30:01] standeth take heed lest he
[1:30:04] fall many of them came out of
[1:30:07] Egypt but Egypt did not come out of
[1:30:11] them they get out there and just go
[1:30:13] through a couple trials next thing you
[1:30:15] know they're crying take us back to the
[1:30:18] leaks and garlics they forgot the whip
[1:30:21] of the
[1:30:22] Taskmaster in amazing God delivers
[1:30:26] you and sets you free from something and
[1:30:28] the next thing you know you start going
[1:30:30] through a trial and you start looking
[1:30:31] back at Egypt like man I didn't have
[1:30:33] such trouble that's what I'm having now
[1:30:36] brother Bram said you have entered a
[1:30:39] Warfare he said it's not a picnic that's
[1:30:42] right Jesus even warned you he said Hey
[1:30:44] listen they hated me they're going to
[1:30:45] hate you yeah well I don't I want

[1:31:17] Canaan so there's a coming out and a
[1:31:19] going into many died in the wilderness
[1:31:22] Journey some were bitten by serpents and
[1:31:26] died some rebelled in the wilderness
[1:31:29] tried to overthrow the leadership of
[1:31:31] Moses Dayan and korus said you take up
[1:31:34] too much Authority for yourself and
[1:31:36] guess what the Earth God finally told
[1:31:39] Moses separate yourself Moses first
[1:31:42] stood in the Gap because he played the
[1:31:43] part of Christ take me first God said
[1:31:47] hey you know it's nice but step aside
[1:31:49] Moses I'm going
[1:31:51] to huh and the Bible says and any of
[1:31:55] those that even
[1:31:57] appertained had anything to do listen to
[1:32:01] their tapes supported their
[1:32:04] Ministry of dethan and Kora he said the
[1:32:12] Earth what happened to all these
[1:32:14] Believers that start saying oh well you
[1:32:16] know what brother brand a prophet at
[1:32:18] this hour you know I made mistakes and
[1:32:21] the dates and all this kind of stuff and
[1:32:23] so why
[1:32:24] like this yeah daan Kora go ahead cuz
[1:32:27] everything that appertaineth to you you
[1:32:29] watch those who leave this message what
[1:32:31] does the world do swallows them
[1:32:34] up do you see any of their lives
[1:32:37] becoming better Christians than what we
[1:32:39] know in the
[1:32:40] message show me one just a matter of
[1:32:44] time and they go right back to that same
[1:32:47] Harlot system some of them have left
[1:32:49] this message and they've gone back to
[1:32:51] the Harlot system and even been read
[1:32:54] baptized now in the name of father son
[1:32:56] Holy Ghost like a hog to its wall and a
[1:32:59] dog to its
[1:33:02] vomit
[1:33:04] M so we understand that these things
[1:33:07] were given to us for our example history
[1:33:10] is repeating itself even
[1:33:12] today we're in another Exodus Journey
[1:33:16] are we
[1:33:17] not listen the people thought they were
[1:33:20] following Moses but Moses was following
[1:33:22] the pillar of Fire right you're not
[1:33:25] following William
[1:33:27] brandom you're following the pillar of
[1:33:30] [Applause]
[1:33:32] fire Hebrews 4: 1 and 2 let us therefore
[1:33:37] fear right A Promise being left us of
[1:33:41] entering into his rest any of you should
[1:33:45] seem to come short of it for unto us was
[1:33:49] the Gospel preached as well as unto
[1:33:52] them but the word preach did not profit
[1:33:56] them not being mixed with faith in them
[1:33:59] that heard
[1:34:01] it
[1:34:02] Faith you see without faith it's
[1:34:05] impossible to please God therefore
[1:34:08] you've got to have Revelation you got to
[1:34:10] have a a working no wonder God had to
[1:34:12] send a messenger to bring us back in
[1:34:15] this day to give us a a a message that
[1:34:19] will return our hearts back to the faith
[1:34:23] right of our fathers you understand that
[1:34:26] thank God Amen
[1:34:31] Hallelujah we can see by what happened
[1:34:34] in the garden and what happened to Eden
[1:34:36] to Adam Adam never lost his
[1:34:43] sunship he just lost his
[1:34:46] inheritance and that was given him
[1:34:49] before the
[1:34:52] fall if you're a true son or daughter of
[1:34:56] God you never lost your sunship you just
[1:35:00] lost your
[1:35:02] inheritance that depends upon each one
[1:35:04] of you to claim your inheritance that
[1:35:06] belongs to
[1:35:07] you because understand though something
[1:35:10] bewilder you do you
[1:35:12] realize that even if you have a living
[1:35:15] trust you have somebody who
[1:35:19] uh who is it that the ex what do you
[1:35:23] call them executor executor of the will
[1:35:26] trustee a trustee of the will so then
[1:35:29] you get the family because you know what
[1:35:31] hey Mom and Dad might have left us
[1:35:32] something I get a bicycle skateboard or
[1:35:36] something you're hoping for more than
[1:35:39] that some of you ain't worth a
[1:35:47] skateboard
[1:35:49] anyway depends on how obedient you are
[1:35:54] so the executive of the will he reads
[1:35:56] the will but guess what you got to be
[1:35:58] there you got to be present and they say
[1:36:00] uh okay are you are you one of these
[1:36:04] that's named on this this

[1:36:41] joking to you wake up wake up it's time
[1:36:45] for your sleeping
[1:36:47] pill okay
[1:36:49] listen here's a synopsis of what Adam
[1:36:53] and Eve lost cuz we're talking about
[1:36:55] brother Brenham said that title deed was
[1:36:58] forfeited he said they lost the right to
[1:37:01] eternal life because the day you eat
[1:37:04] thereof is the day you you're going to
[1:37:08] die you're cut off no more eternal
[1:37:14] life they lost their position in the
[1:37:17] garden and they were cast out and guess
[1:37:20] what he didn't have to work in the
[1:37:22] garden right everything was there oh he
[1:37:25] tilled the ground and everything but
[1:37:26] that was
[1:37:28] it now by the sweat of your
[1:37:33] brow I remember brother Mitch Buckingham
[1:37:37] we were just young kids in the message a
[1:37:40] short time he said praise
[1:37:43] God he says I know why I don't like to
[1:37:46] go to work he said it's not God's
[1:37:49] original
[1:37:52] will
[1:37:54] imagine now they're cast
[1:37:57] out they lost their power over
[1:38:01] nature and all the
[1:38:06] animals before then if there was a
[1:38:09] grizzly bear or if there was something
[1:38:12] there they didn't have to run from it it
[1:38:14] didn't run from the hey come here man
[1:38:15] you want you want to wrestle come
[1:38:18] on
[1:38:21] right they lost lost their Affinity with
[1:38:25] nature and they lost their power of the
[1:38:27] spoken word to say whatever and tree be
[1:38:30] plucked up and go over here right so
[1:38:32] they lost the power of the spoken word
[1:38:34] because Adam was a minor
[1:38:39] God he lost the
[1:38:42] right to the tree of
[1:38:44] life and now the Tree of Life they can't
[1:38:48] eat of it and it's guarded it's it's got
[1:38:51] Angels guarding it with a
[1:38:54] sword so now if God had Angels guarding
[1:38:59] it with a sword in order to return back
[1:39:03] he's got to have another angel with a
[1:39:08] sword bringing us
[1:39:11] back and this time not guarding it
[1:39:14] saying come on back to the word it's the
[1:39:16] word of God the word of God is our
[1:39:19] absolute that is God's Plum line that is
[1:39:22] what you need man should not live by
[1:39:24] bread alone but by every word in this
[1:39:26] Prophet every sermon it's back to the
[1:39:29] word it's back to what God said this is
[1:39:32] God's blueprint somebody say
[1:39:34] [Applause]
[1:39:37] amen he said never back to a church
[1:39:39] never back to a Creed never back to a
[1:39:41] Dogma never back to Seminary school he

[1:39:47] [Applause]
[1:39:50] Lord prise God thank you Lord that's
[1:39:53] true Tree of Life taken from them they
[1:39:56] could not eat of
[1:39:58] it but God rich in Mercy has got a plan
[1:40:01] to bring it back Hallelujah are you

[1:40:19] because if you I don't
[1:40:22] care huh you ain't getting
[1:40:25] it legally you ain't getting it you have
[1:40:28] to want it so it is also with your

[1:41:05] amen
[1:41:07] so if we see in Genesis 3 it was guarded
[1:41:12] there has to be somewhere in the Bible
[1:41:15] where he brings it back so Revelations 2
[1:41:17] and7 he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:41:21] what the spirit saith un the churches to
[1:41:23] him that

[1:42:06] tree of life and may enter in through
[1:42:09] the gates into the city now let's look
[1:42:12] what the prophet of God said about this
[1:42:14] earnestly contending for the face
[1:42:17] 1953 God put a cherubim angel with a
[1:42:20] flaming sword around the tree to protect
[1:42:23] that tree of life that's right God used
[1:42:26] a cherubim with a flaming
[1:42:29] sword guarded it see it was an angel
[1:42:31] with a sword that guarded the Tree of
[1:42:34] Life man lost his right to the Tree of
[1:42:36] Life in Genesis
[1:42:38] 3 so it's got to be an
[1:42:42] angel to open the way back amen but he
[1:42:46] takes an I want to ask
[1:42:48] you which is greater an angel in the
[1:42:51] Pulpit or an angel in

[1:46:27] only revealed to the
[1:46:31] elect
[1:46:33] amen driving hurting them back to the
[1:46:36] tree of life amen let's look at what the
[1:46:40] prophet of God said about Adam losing
[1:46:42] the title
[1:46:44] deed 1961 Revelation 5 he just controls
[1:46:50] the
[1:46:50] world he said they were his is and he's
[1:46:53] the god of the
[1:46:54] world Jesus said he was and he is he's
[1:46:58] the God of this Earth how many know he
[1:47:01] was kicked out of heaven and this became
[1:47:03] his
[1:47:04] domain that's why when he said why if
[1:47:07] you'll sit down and worship me I'll give
[1:47:10] you the kingdoms of this
[1:47:13] world Jesus said my
[1:47:16] kingdoms not of this world why I'm going
[1:47:18] to change
[1:47:21] it has blinded the eyes of the
[1:47:25] people the God of this Earth he's he's
[1:47:29] the god of heaven and now he rightly
[1:47:32] don't own this he doesn't own it talking
[1:47:35] about the earth now remember the title
[1:47:37] deed of redemption and the title deed to
[1:47:40] the Earth and eternal
[1:47:42] life and add Adam forfeited the title
[1:47:45] deed to it to this and all this stuff
[1:47:48] that we own eternal life and the
[1:47:50] inheriting of the earth Jesus said in
[1:47:52] Matthew Matthew 5 blessed are the meek
[1:47:55] for they shall inherit the
[1:47:56] earth now we don't have it
[1:48:00] now and it wasn't to Adam or any of his
[1:48:04] seeds Adam's seed absolutely lost
[1:48:07] everything it's not the seed of Adam no
[1:48:10] matter how much we try to beautify this
[1:48:12] world how much we try to make big fine
[1:48:14] homes and things it still doesn't belong
[1:48:17] to Adam's seed no sir it's not to go to
[1:48:22] Adam's seed no sir because Satan took it
[1:48:24] locked stuck and Barrel right for Adam
[1:48:27] forfeited
[1:48:29] it now now if we stopped right there we
[1:48:33] would be pretty sad-faced
[1:48:36] people huh we would oh man there who's
[1:48:40] worthy to take the book who's
[1:48:43] worthy Revelation chapter 5 paragraph
[1:48:47] 161 now our kinsman redeemer has handed
[1:48:50] the seven sealed book of redemption

[1:49:25] Redemption is
[1:49:27] gone man is forever
[1:49:31] doomed and John began to walk away
[1:49:34] weeping with his head

[1:58:21] enters his Ministry now he's been on
[1:58:23] Earth for a half hour of Silence 30
[1:58:27] years you
[1:58:29] understand 30 years of Silence don't you
[1:58:33] know that I must be about my father's
[1:58:36] business but a priest in the Old
[1:58:38] Testament could not become a levitical
[1:58:41] priest until he's 30 years of age he now
[1:58:44] comes to the
[1:58:46] temple Luke 4:1 17- 21 follow along with
[1:58:50] me and there was delivered unto him the
[1:58:53] book of the prophet
[1:58:55] isaas and when he had opened the
[1:58:59] book he found the place where it was
[1:59:03] written the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:59:06] me because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:59:09] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:59:11] heal the brokenhearted to preach the
[1:59:13] Deliverance of the cap to the captives
[1:59:15] recovering of sight to the Blind and
[1:59:18] set at Liberty them that are bruised to
[1:59:21] preach the acceptable year of the
[1:59:24] Lord and he closed the
[1:59:30] book he said there would be 2,000 years
[1:59:35] separating from the acceptable year to
[1:59:38] the day of Vengeance right
[1:59:41] yes so he knew right where I'm going to

[1:59:50] Ministry yes amen and he closed the book
[1:59:53] and gave it again to the minister and
[1:59:54] sat down and the eyes of all of them
[1:59:57] that were in the synagogue were fastened
[1:59:59] on him and he began to say to them this
[2:00:02] day is this scripture fulfilled in your
[2:00:07] ears that was the chapter or the volume
[2:00:10] of the book that spoke of his
[2:00:12] ministry he found the scripture

[2:00:42] that Christ later says

[2:00:48] anointing was causing him yes to play

[2:03:34] feet Heaven and Earth have pass away but
[2:03:37] my word will never pass
[2:03:39] away amen so let me just say a few
[2:03:43] things
[2:03:45] here our Bible is not only a book of
[2:03:49] history of what has happened but it's a
[2:03:51] book foretelling future
[2:03:55] events and the reason we're hearing all
[2:03:58] of these things that are happening and
[2:03:59] all this news that's going on is because
[2:04:03] scripture must be
[2:04:05] fulfilled when you hear of wars and
[2:04:08] rumors of
[2:04:09] wars because the scripture must be
[2:04:14] fulfilled Nations shall rise against
[2:04:16] Nation the scripture must be fulfilled
[2:04:20] false prophets false teachers Rising
[2:04:23] seducers waxing worse and worse the
[2:04:26] scripture must be
[2:04:29] fulfilled gender identity is such a
[2:04:31] problem today yeah are you kidding
[2:04:35] me you see when Eve came to Adam he said
[2:04:39] you're
[2:04:40] woman right right your identity comes
[2:04:43] from the one who you come
[2:04:47] from you're a woman you're a man you're
[2:04:50] a woman you're a man
[2:04:52] if you want to know what gender you are
[2:04:54] ask
[2:04:57] him
[2:04:58] otherwise oh let me see I remember I I I
[2:05:03] told you I was flying through Australia
[2:05:05] here a couple years ago and you know you
[2:05:08] you have to change Terminals and you go
[2:05:10] through uh extra security and you get
[2:05:12] over here and there's two lines and
[2:05:14] they're checking bags again before you
[2:05:16] even get into the seating area all I
[2:05:18] want to do is go sit down I've got my
[2:05:19] boarding pass I'm ready to go and they
[2:05:22] and I come up here and uh you know
[2:05:26] there's two lines so I quickly am
[2:05:27] reading I look up which line is shorter
[2:05:30] I'll get in the shorter line oh somebody
[2:05:33] Taps me on the
[2:05:34] shoulder uh excuse me you're in the
[2:05:36] wrong
[2:05:39] line and it's all
[2:05:42] women I felt so
[2:05:45] silly but then I thought Bing well you
[2:05:49] know today I want to be a woman
[2:05:53] you know what they
[2:05:55] did I said no I'm just joking I went
[2:05:57] over there
[2:06:00] every just try to move me out of this L
[2:06:03] today I identify just for a few moments
[2:06:06] until I sit down I'm a
[2:06:11] woman people are
[2:06:14] crazy you get your
[2:06:16] identity from who you were made
[2:06:20] from that's why the only ones brother
[2:06:23] renom said as a he says I like a man to
[2:06:26] be a man I like a woman to be a woman he
[2:06:29] says why today there's so much
[2:06:31] perversion and stuff he said I was on a
[2:06:34] bus I think it was and he said I had
[2:06:36] this one sitting next to me welding
[2:06:38] goggles on and dirty overalls and
[2:06:41] different things like that and brother R
[2:06:43] said I told a
[2:06:44] joke and he slapped the leg or the knee
[2:06:48] of the person next to him and he said
[2:06:49] the discernment in his hand
[2:06:53] woman you ever you ever seen some of
[2:06:56] them you can't
[2:06:58] tell he couldn't tell is that
[2:07:07] joke now now listen we we can really
[2:07:12] think it's a joke can't we about gender
[2:07:16] identity but they're trying to tell our
[2:07:18] young
[2:07:19] children such perverted
[2:07:24] lies okay but watch this okay God is
[2:07:29] sending you a message that has for you
[2:07:33] even your gender
[2:07:35] identity a man be a man a woman be a
[2:07:39] woman amen all right all
[2:07:45] right
[2:07:47] now why is all this
[2:07:50] happening the Bible says 2 Thessalonians
[2:07:53] 2 11 and 12 and for this cause God shall
[2:07:56] send them strong
[2:07:59] delusion that they should believe a
[2:08:05] lie wow I think they all work
[2:08:09] for
[2:08:13] MSN that they all might be damned who
[2:08:15] believe not the truth but had pleasure
[2:08:18] in
[2:08:20] unrighteousness now I want to ask you
[2:08:22] who gave them strong
[2:08:25] delusion God
[2:08:28] did God is allowing these people to have
[2:08:32] reprobate Minds strong delusion so that
[2:08:35] they'll be leave Al lie and
[2:08:39] be damned I'm
[2:08:42] sorry what the Bible says in other
[2:08:45] words God who is the author wrote the
[2:08:49] script and he said that the scripture
[2:08:52] might be
[2:08:55] fulfilled now let me show you another
[2:08:58] portion of scripture Romans 1:
[2:09:03] 21-32 because that when they knew God
[2:09:07] they glorified him not as God neither
[2:09:10] were thankful but became vain in their
[2:09:13] imaginations their foolish heart was
[2:09:15] dark and professing themselves to be
[2:09:17] wise they became
[2:09:20] fools educated
[2:09:24] idiots so wise with
[2:09:28] knowledge they become fools
[2:09:31] right and changed the glory of the
[2:09:34] uncorruptible god into an image made
[2:09:36] like a corruptible man Birds four-footed
[2:09:38] beasts and creeping
[2:09:40] things wherefore God also gave them up
[2:09:43] to what God did watch what God does
[2:09:47] because these guys they get so far out
[2:09:50] I'm going to turn over to an uncleanness
[2:09:53] through the lust of their own desire
[2:09:55] their own Hearts to dishonor their own
[2:09:58] bodies between themselves watch he said
[2:10:00] I'm going to I'm going to turn them over
[2:10:03] who changed the truth of God to a
[2:10:06] lie and worshiped and serve the creature
[2:10:09] more than the Creator who is blessed
[2:10:11] forever amen for this
[2:10:14] cause God gave them up to vile
[2:10:17] affections even their women did change
[2:10:20] the natural use into that which is
[2:10:22] against
[2:10:27] nature and likewise also the
[2:10:30] men well he covers all the bases women
[2:10:35] you're going to start liking one another
[2:10:38] men leaving the natural use of the woman
[2:10:41] what happened in the days of
[2:10:43] Sodom you remember lot says hey you can
[2:10:46] have take my two daughters there's
[2:10:47] virgins do with them what you want you
[2:10:49] can have them how would you like your
[2:10:51] daddy to give you away like
[2:10:53] that and you know what they said we
[2:10:55] don't want the
[2:10:57] women give us the
[2:11:00] men such a Sodom perversion so watch
[2:11:04] this leaving the natural use of the
[2:11:07] woman burned their lust one towards
[2:11:10] another men with men working which that
[2:11:13] which is
[2:11:16] unseemly and receiving in themselves
[2:11:18] that recompense of their ER which was me
[2:11:22] and even as they did not like to retain
[2:11:24] God in their knowledge God gave them
[2:11:26] over to a reprobate
[2:11:28] mind to do those things which are not
[2:11:32] convenient you you want to see the vast
[2:11:35] majority of people out here that's
[2:11:36] ruling our country and the politics and
[2:11:39] and everything Hey
[2:11:40] listen this election ain't going to turn
[2:11:42] America
[2:11:45] around don't put your
[2:11:47] trust in any of this world politics
[2:11:51] America's going down it's thus sayith
[2:11:54] the Lord she's over it's history I'm
[2:11:57] sorry young people I'd love to see
[2:11:59] America come back and be what it was it
[2:12:01] ain't no
[2:12:03] way ain't going to
[2:12:09] happen brother Brenham said go go back
[2:12:11] and look in the early 60s he said
[2:12:14] they've got these voting machines that
[2:12:15] are corrupted they said you vote for one
[2:12:17] and it changes the vote to another
[2:12:22] he said they're going to do it yeah so I
[2:12:24] don't put no trust in any any kind of
[2:12:27] voting and all of the kind I took one
[2:12:29] vote that's the only one that really
[2:12:31] counts how many of you say I took a vote
[2:12:33] for Jesus Christ amen that's the one
[2:12:36] that I that I I I'm not neither Democrat
[2:12:40] nor
[2:12:40] Republican hey because they're both
[2:12:42] corrupt amen now you have to guess
[2:12:45] between the lesser of two
[2:12:49] evils who you vote for I I already voted
[2:12:53] amen amen now watch this now watch that
[2:12:56] the scripture must be fulfilled Jesus
[2:12:59] identifies this in St John 19 three
[2:13:02] different times in one
[2:13:05] chapter and they said therefore among
[2:13:07] themselves let us not Rend it but cast
[2:13:10] lots for it whose it shall be now those
[2:13:13] are the Roman soldiers who are taking
[2:13:16] the Garment of
[2:13:17] Jesus that the scripture might be
[2:13:20] fulfilled
[2:13:21] they don't know their fulfilling
[2:13:23] scripture neither do these
[2:13:26] reprobates they don't know but the
[2:13:29] scripture must be
[2:13:31] fulfilled which saith they parted my
[2:13:34] reignment among them and for my vesture
[2:13:37] they did cast lots these things
[2:13:38] therefore the soldiers
[2:13:40] did these things therefore why cuz it
[2:13:44] was written in the word okay that the
[2:13:47] scripture be fulfilled John 19: 28
[2:13:51] after this Jesus knowing that all things
[2:13:53] were now accomplished that the scripture
[2:13:56] might be fulfilled saith I thirst he's
[2:13:59] on the
[2:14:00] cross he does that because he knows the
[2:14:03] scripture must be
[2:14:05] fulfilled 19:36 and these things were
[2:14:08] done that the scripture should be
[2:14:10] fulfilled a bone of him shall not be
[2:14:13] broken see all of this must be fulfilled
[2:14:18] the scripture must be fulfilled listen
[2:14:20] if the furnace of laiaa is seven times
[2:14:24] hotter
[2:14:26] right liken onto the time of the three
[2:14:30] Hebrew children then there must be a
[2:14:34] people like Shadrach meach and abendigo
[2:14:37] that will not
[2:14:40] bow we saw them what about us if there's
[2:14:44] a people that will take the mark of the
[2:14:46] beast then there must be a people who
[2:14:49] will take this seal of
[2:14:55] [Applause]
[2:14:57] God one takes a mark of the beast the
[2:14:59] other takes the Seal of God the vice
[2:15:03] versa if the kingdoms of this
[2:15:06] world are all falling apart there must
[2:15:09] be a kingdom that is coming that shall
[2:15:12] not fall apart whose kingdom cannot be
[2:15:16] shook amen thank God I'm not going to
[2:15:20] inherit this world that's right he's
[2:15:23] going to burn it over renovate it as
[2:15:26] much as how beautiful this Earth is now
[2:15:30] go up into the mountains you look in the
[2:15:32] Majestic forest and the blue skies and
[2:15:35] you get out there and really and the
[2:15:38] oceans and there is beauty that our eyes
[2:15:41] behold here but if you think it's pretty
[2:15:44] now what will it be like when he
[2:15:48] renovates
[2:15:49] it
[2:15:51] all I know is I want to be
[2:16:00] there there are those who were turned
[2:16:03] over to their own fleshly
[2:16:05] desires then there must be a people whom
[2:16:09] God has turned over to the very mind of
[2:16:13] Christ that they might fulfill his
[2:16:17] desires are you following
[2:16:19] me that the scripture might be
[2:16:24] fulfilled if there is a natural monetary
[2:16:27] system that is
[2:16:30] failing and the whole thing is falling
[2:16:32] apart and it's based on a gold standard

[2:37:00] day this was a serious man in my
[2:37:04] church got a nice little family wife
[2:37:07] with a couple
[2:37:08] kids man so he tells me he's a prophet
[2:37:12] okay so I'm watching him okay well then
[2:37:17] I have another guy that he talks to this
[2:37:20] first prophet and he and he says well
[2:37:23] what why you growing a beer well I'm a
[2:37:24] prophet now because you know I'm going
[2:37:25] to have to come he said you ain't the
[2:37:27] prophet I'm the
[2:37:30] prophet now this first prophet I'm going
[2:37:32] to tell you how far he went the Bible
[2:37:35] says Thy word is a lamp under my feet
[2:37:38] this guy was a genius on how he could
[2:37:40] invent things you know Aaron's Rod he
[2:37:43] made Aaron's Rod he made it so many
[2:37:46] cubits he put seven colors of the
[2:37:48] rainbow on it he put a pyramid with gold
[2:37:52] leaf at the top he had LED lights around
[2:37:55] it he hooked it up do you remember the
[2:37:58] Walkman you remember the first Walkman
[2:38:00] you could a little cassette player he
[2:38:03] hooked it there and so and he made he he
[2:38:06] had a robe his wife made him a robe and
[2:38:09] so after work he'd put his robe on put
[2:38:11] his hood on and he'd walk at night with
[2:38:16] eron's Rod with a pyramid at the top and
[2:38:19] brother bram's voice when he says good
[2:38:21] evening friends the lights would light
[2:38:23] up on the LED and he could walk good
[2:38:26] evening friends I greet you the word is
[2:38:30] a lamp under my feet do you see what I'm
[2:38:33] saying and he would do this and he'
[2:38:34] listen to all the tapes of brother
[2:38:36] brandham oh wow I'm the prophet I'm I'm
[2:38:39] probably
[2:38:40] Moses I'm going to be the one to go to
[2:38:42] Israel now these guys are sincere man
[2:38:45] you don't you don't joke with them
[2:38:46] they're sincere one guy said you can't
[2:38:48] be Moses I'm Moses he said I'll tell you
[2:38:51] another thing he says you know what you
[2:38:54] can't be that
[2:38:55] Prophet um because I'm that Prophet so
[2:38:58] now the second prophet convinces the
[2:39:01] first one no you ain't that Prophet I'm
[2:39:03] the prophet so he said take Aaron's Rod
[2:39:06] take the cloak take the pyramid take all
[2:39:09] this stuff and make a bonfire and put
[2:39:11] all this stuff in the
[2:39:13] fire so they do they they go and make a
[2:39:17] bonfire do you know what happens to a
[2:39:19] batter when you put it in a
[2:39:23] fire now you can think this is funny you
[2:39:26] guys know what a a pocket New Testament
[2:39:28] is the little tiny small Bible just
[2:39:31] Matthew through Revelation so the second
[2:39:35] prophet has got a New Testament Bible in
[2:39:38] his pocket they're sitting around the
[2:39:40] the fire watching all of this Burn Right
[2:39:43] all of a
[2:39:45] sudden man Sparks go all over and a big
[2:39:48] old amember comes out hits this brother
[2:39:50] right here on the pocket and the thing
[2:39:54] that saved him was the pocket Bible see
[2:39:57] brother the devil come right out of the
[2:39:59] fire but the word stop I mean listen it
[2:40:02] just got so far out so what happened to
[2:40:05] the first
[2:40:06] prophet he said you know what I think

[2:40:11] poet so he
[2:40:14] started
[2:40:16] writing uh Shakespearean Pro Pros any of
[2:40:20] you take a English Shakespearean
[2:40:25] pros
[2:40:29] and where do they wind up
