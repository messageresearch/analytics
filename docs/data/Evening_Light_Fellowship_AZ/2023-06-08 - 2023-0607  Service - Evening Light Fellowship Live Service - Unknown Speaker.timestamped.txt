[29:55] it is a privilege once again to be in
[29:59] the house of the Lord
[30:01] with all the federal delay we're going
[30:04] to take the Bible
[30:07] be able to read the word we're still
[30:11] going to read from where we read the
[30:13] last time in the book of
[30:17] Luke I believe
[30:25] foreign
[30:41] Luke chapter 22 verse 24 to 30.
[30:54] and there was also a Strife among them
[30:57] which of them should be accounted uh the
[31:02] greatest and he said unto them the kings
[31:04] of the Gentiles exercised lordship over
[31:06] them and this and they that exercise
[31:09] Authority upon them are called
[31:11] benefactors but ye shall not be so but
[31:15] he that is greatest among you let him be
[31:18] as the younger and he that is Chief as
[31:22] he that Dove serve for weather is
[31:26] greater he that seedeth admit or he that
[31:29] a service is not he does it have admit
[31:33] but I am among you as he that serveth ye
[31:38] I tell you which have continued with me
[31:41] in my in my Temptation and I'll appoint
[31:45] you
[31:45] a point unto you a kingdom as my father
[31:49] have appointed unto me that ye may eat
[31:53] and drink at my table in my kingdom and
[31:57] sit on Thrones judging the 12 tribes of
[32:00] Israel amen may God bless you you may be
[32:03] seated uh once again I would like to
[32:06] thank the pastor who is not around or
[32:10] for the
[32:11] trust years are loaded unto me given me
[32:14] to be able to
[32:16] share the word tonight as uh we'll be
[32:19] continuing on the subject I started
[32:23] last time they thought the pouring of
[32:25] the Gentile nations in the end times I
[32:28] Believe by God's grace so it's uh it has
[32:31] a lot of more stuff going with it but I
[32:34] will just take my time as uh time goes
[32:37] by and as I we have recordings and
[32:41] taking notes and stuff to be able to
[32:43] review them time to time as the Lord
[32:46] leads you to uh because uh we'll get to
[32:50] some times that are very where I'm
[32:53] really headed to by God's grace but it
[32:55] is important for us to lay down uh all
[32:58] the aspect that will when everything
[33:01] will bridge in the near future but God's
[33:05] Grace will be able to see the point why
[33:08] the pattern of the Gentiles in the end
[33:11] times uh we saw last time uh we went to
[33:15] into Genesis 11 uh where we saw Nimrod
[33:20] um starting out uh his mind he had three
[33:24] things that he was uh following in his
[33:26] mind that he wanted to build a strong
[33:29] nation which he did he wanted to
[33:31] propagate his own religion which he did
[33:34] which will shall go a little bit deeper
[33:36] into night and he wanted to make a name
[33:39] for himself for which he also did I
[33:42] touched a little bit on that on the
[33:44] conclusion last time but but God's grace
[33:46] uh it's I think it's very important to
[33:49] go a little bit take
[33:52] spread it in a little bit in so that we
[33:55] can be able to grasp it so that it
[33:58] doesn't sound as a harsh sermon but
[34:00] instead the God is uh following a
[34:04] purpose here
[34:05] uh we see that by God's grace uh uh the
[34:10] word has it comes forth Gods as a
[34:12] program uh with God's program it doesn't
[34:15] change regardless of where any Minister
[34:18] can take it at the end of the day uh we
[34:21] have received a profit and this Prophet
[34:23] has brought us a message bringing out
[34:25] what got ahead in the back part of his
[34:28] mind and what got in the back part of
[34:30] his mind is given to diminish the
[34:32] prophet and the prophet hands it to the
[34:35] minister the minister to the people so
[34:37] the pattern Remains the Same so there's
[34:39] no two three four messages if uh it have
[34:42] happens that it come across as like you
[34:44] know it doesn't is not as clear you just
[34:47] take the pattern as the program says
[34:49] shows it unto us in the seven Church
[34:51] ages it says that you know out of the
[34:53] ages comes the sales out of the sales
[34:55] the trumpets or the trumpets the veils
[34:58] until all the Revelation is open before
[35:01] our wandering eyes and we are edified to
[35:04] say four years ago glorious appearing so
[35:07] when you see the entire thing and it's
[35:09] hit where it goes into the edges it says
[35:11] I want you to remember these things that
[35:14] we want to see the two spirits in the
[35:17] framework of the church so then you can
[35:19] see like you know though it gives us the
[35:21] whole program of God God wanted to
[35:24] restore even you wanted to have a
[35:26] preeminence upon his people and wanted
[35:28] to restore the men to the position that
[35:31] he had but then over time we see that
[35:33] you know this is a space of almost two
[35:36] thousand two thousand years along these
[35:39] two thousand years time goes by event
[35:41] takes place but then the purpose of a
[35:43] prophet is now to take all those events
[35:45] and give you a perspective because the
[35:49] world has perspective of what it is that
[35:51] people can call themselves Democrat and
[35:54] some will call themselves uh Republican
[35:57] conservatives and all these things with
[35:59] basically what they're doing they're
[36:00] taking the very same information that we
[36:02] have at our at our hand and they give it
[36:05] a perception they said they'll tell you
[36:07] that no we have to look at it this way
[36:09] then you have the denomination so they
[36:11] also take the same information they take
[36:13] the same Bible and they look at it
[36:15] through a certain perspective but then
[36:18] we believe by faith you know there's no
[36:21] uh factual intellectual fact whereby we
[36:24] can stand and say like you know the
[36:25] prophet is the prophet of of Malacca
[36:28] fall but by faith and by Revelation
[36:31] because understand like you know it can
[36:33] be a hard statement but we know that
[36:36] anybody who has knowledge can take the
[36:38] book and can say like you know oh
[36:39] William pranam is not a guy you know
[36:41] here Malachi 4 we see uh one part here
[36:44] but then when it comes he divides
[36:46] Malachi 4 into two parts it tells you
[36:48] like you know Malachi 3 has fulfilled
[36:51] the first part then you you know it just
[36:53] comes open to whom it is given but then
[36:57] so the rest of them is like no that's
[36:59] not true you cannot divide a word like
[37:01] that but it's only given to a certain
[37:04] people that's why I like Hero by God's
[37:06] grace those elements are now given to us
[37:09] to be able to access the word so now
[37:12] when the word is given to us is not to
[37:14] be given in in a historical point where
[37:17] we stand and we look at the word and we
[37:19] say like you know oh this has already
[37:21] passed that you know in the time of uh
[37:22] and by Revelation and then we're able to
[37:25] understand ourselves because William
[37:27] Branham growing up as a Young Man
[37:29] couldn't understand his own life he
[37:31] wanted to uh be a ranger out they wanted
[37:35] to do what he thought he would just the
[37:37] same as all of us wanted to be whatever
[37:40] we wanted to be but then since the Lord
[37:43] has has a hold Upon Our Lives then it
[37:47] leads us in a certain manner for us to
[37:49] come to this perfect realization so we
[37:52] understand like in um the the framework
[37:55] of the church we have two spirits and
[37:57] these two Spirits have their own
[37:59] objectives and now at times now for
[38:03] those two those two spirit to be able to
[38:06] get to where they want to get they
[38:08] didn't have to you they have to have
[38:10] vessels those vessels are you and I in a
[38:13] way or another born from north south
[38:15] east and west the devil is interested in
[38:18] you and God is also interested in you
[38:20] and the same way in the same manner the
[38:23] Lord now comes to us to give us the
[38:25] information to understand the benefit of
[38:28] why should you be embracing this program
[38:31] because also as we saw that you know
[38:33] Nimrod has three purpose in what he's
[38:36] doing he wants to have a people that he
[38:40] wants to uh to rule upon and it goes
[38:43] about by Conquering the land he goes and
[38:45] he divides the people up depending on
[38:48] either the white black and yellow mixed
[38:52] and whatever you want to call it because
[38:54] once upon a time people of the earth
[38:57] lived under Jehovah God not uh you know
[39:01] some Mary and some Pope and some
[39:04] president and out there but they lived
[39:07] under his leadership when they lived
[39:09] under his leadership they didn't know
[39:11] that you know this only the only thing
[39:13] they knew that this is my brother this
[39:15] is my sister but then when Nimrod came
[39:18] then we came to realize that you know we
[39:20] have our left hand we have our right
[39:21] hand what is that education it brought
[39:24] education about to start now dividing
[39:27] people to stand like you know hey you
[39:29] people deserve this and they don't
[39:31] deserve that and you people shouldn't
[39:33] mix with this and you know people this
[39:35] are not smart and these are way smarter
[39:38] you belong for this and all that so
[39:41] that's how nimrode sought to up
[39:44] fulfilled that great vision of his or
[39:47] that he had nevertheless
[39:49] the Lord comes and start providing these
[39:52] informations and when Nimrod came about
[39:55] and started dividing the land and then
[39:58] introduced culture as we saw last time
[40:01] when he introduced introduced culture
[40:03] then people were separated into tribes
[40:07] into country into uh continents and into
[40:11] you know all these things that we want
[40:13] but then it didn't stop there because he
[40:16] also wanted to bring the people to
[40:19] worship Him and in order to be worshiped
[40:21] he had to do if to do it he had to know
[40:25] exactly how to proceed and he started by
[40:28] taking the people away one step at a
[40:31] time away from the worship of God so
[40:34] then it transformed and is going to use
[40:37] all kind of means possible in order for
[40:40] him to bring the people to worship Him
[40:42] and we see that uh
[40:45] when the people were worshiping the
[40:47] Jehovah God they couldn't see him they
[40:50] didn't see him because remember this is
[40:52] after the fall that you know the they
[40:54] didn't know uh they were cast out from
[40:57] the presence of God and the Lord said
[41:00] okay this is it you've sinned you didn't
[41:03] listen to what I told you now you're
[41:05] going to be that
[41:06] comes a time where people had to receive
[41:09] now another form of worship and by
[41:12] receiving that form of worship the
[41:15] thought that it looked so nice and it
[41:18] looks so natural and they started
[41:20] following what the devil was giving them
[41:22] one step at a time just like a brother
[41:25] who bats Elijah sister he doesn't box
[41:28] the light like you know on the click
[41:30] overnight no you know it takes stages
[41:32] you know today he was sitting on the
[41:35] first few then tomorrow is in the middle
[41:37] and then he's on the back and then it
[41:39] doesn't come to church anymore you know
[41:41] so it's all those stages that Nimrod
[41:45] does also to bring uh his religion about
[41:48] because when you don't you lose interest
[41:51] in the word of God it means like the The
[41:54] Emptiness has to be filled with
[41:56] something else so therefore the uh
[41:59] Nimrod knew that okay God we don't see
[42:03] him
[42:04] because if we have to deal with anybody
[42:06] we have to see him I have to see my
[42:08] brother like you know brother we're
[42:10] going to meet I know that when I go I
[42:12] have to see somebody but then if the sun
[42:14] comes I don't know I'm looking for your
[42:16] father not you because there's direct
[42:19] distinct there but then
[42:21] nimrody knew that and said well
[42:24] it doesn't exist
[42:26] we don't see him
[42:28] do you talk to him
[42:30] there were no relationship
[42:32] they were just they didn't have any
[42:34] knowledge but then with education the
[42:37] devil now Nimrod came about and started
[42:39] giving people information he started
[42:42] with the religion on the first stage he
[42:45] said he replaced uh the head of an old
[42:49] medicine symbolizing God the father he
[42:52] said well if you say like there's a God
[42:54] that means like you know he's got the
[42:57] father you don't see him he's a spirit
[42:59] we agree upon that everybody will say
[43:02] yeah you don't see God nobody can sin
[43:04] God there are scriptures about it and
[43:07] then uh at a certain point he started it
[43:10] kept them it took them a little bit
[43:12] further and said okay instead of having
[43:15] just God the Father let's put him uh in
[43:18] a circle in which the mystery signify
[43:21] the seed which turned to be the sun okay
[43:24] the father you don't see the father
[43:26] let us deal with the Sun
[43:29] how do we represent the sun we put him
[43:32] just as a circle with a little symbol
[43:35] there
[43:35] it didn't seem very offensive at the
[43:38] beginning but then he was driving them
[43:41] first away until then he'll be able to
[43:45] be worshiped then afterward it took them
[43:48] a little bit further and then
[43:49] represented that since you don't see the
[43:52] father he's a spirit
[43:55] now we have a son which is a seed let us
[43:59] give you something that is more
[44:03] or something that you can see or
[44:05] something that you can touch then you
[44:07] represented it with the wings and tell
[44:09] of a dove you go in all the churches
[44:12] that's what it is represented as when
[44:15] you look at everywhere we know like you
[44:16] know the Catholic church and all the
[44:18] denominations when we want to speak
[44:20] about purity and all these things
[44:22] straight we go to the dove why because
[44:25] the Nimrod Saturday is somewhere because
[44:27] many times we do all kinds of things in
[44:30] our lives we might not understand
[44:31] exactly why do we why we do what we do
[44:34] but it was necessary for you for him to
[44:38] uh for him to do that in order to to
[44:41] bring the things about
[44:43] then Burnham says in the program in
[44:45] church ages he said here was the
[44:47] doctrine of the Father Son and Holy
[44:49] Ghost three persons in the godhead a
[44:52] veritable a veritable Trinity you can
[44:55] see the same thing in Rome now let me
[44:58] ask
[44:59] um once again it is not strange that the
[45:02] devil and his worshipers actually had
[45:05] more truth revealed than the father of
[45:08] Faith Abraham and his and his descendant
[45:10] it is not strange that the worshipers
[45:12] have Satan knew more about God than the
[45:15] children of God of of God what is it
[45:18] doing is bringing the people the
[45:19] information he's telling them like you
[45:21] know hey whatever you know
[45:24] you can show me there's a God out there
[45:27] but then let me take you a little bit
[45:29] further let me explain it to you because
[45:31] uh in the history it was called the
[45:34] Nimrod was called the the revealer of
[45:37] the word
[45:38] he took himself like you know that uh
[45:41] that title they say like you know I'm
[45:43] going to reveal to you what you do not
[45:45] know it is the same pattern as it was in
[45:48] the Garden of Eden it came to Eve and
[45:51] telling her I will teach you what you
[45:53] don't know because you have to become
[45:56] God
[45:57] as it is today like you know they can
[45:59] tell a man a grown man went to school
[46:01] and with all his knowledge you can be a
[46:03] dog you can be a woman when you're a man
[46:05] you can be a man when you're a woman so
[46:08] the very same teaching that he started
[46:10] it never changes way he's only changing
[46:12] his forms he's only changing his uh his
[46:15] uh appearance but he is still using the
[46:18] very same techniques because he wants to
[46:21] be worshiped and what does he say he
[46:24] says he sees like well since God the
[46:27] father that you worship so much
[46:29] doesn't talk to you we don't have a
[46:32] proof of it what do we do then it's
[46:35] better for we to look at him as ease
[46:39] because any son who talks to his father
[46:41] and the father doesn't answer back
[46:44] eventually is going to start ignoring
[46:47] the father he's going to find where the
[46:49] solution is probably his friends if he
[46:52] can take all the necessary advice from
[46:55] the father is going to deal with the
[46:57] friends or deal with uh
[46:59] the the figure with a very honorable man
[47:03] out there some books at the library to
[47:06] take all the necessary knowledge for him
[47:08] to be able to face what uh tomorrow
[47:11] holds for him
[47:12] then after him doing that
[47:15] it changes that it says well
[47:18] you have a seed
[47:20] you have a Dolph
[47:22] but that's not enough
[47:24] let me bring it down
[47:27] and in order for us to receive anything
[47:30] physical what do we do
[47:33] for any human beings born on Earth
[47:35] natural sense will tell you we need to
[47:37] have a wife in order for us to have a
[47:40] child
[47:41] so what does he do he brings out a woman
[47:44] he brings out nimrodha Nimrod wife and
[47:48] says well this is the mother
[47:51] who shall bear the seed
[47:55] so now since the mother will be bearing
[47:57] the seed
[47:58] what do we see now we see now we only
[48:01] you can only expect that the seed will
[48:04] come through the woman
[48:06] and he will also take the scripture and
[48:09] tell you like you know hey the promise
[48:11] is given
[48:12] that a the woman the seed of the woman
[48:16] shall come forth but now as I Am The
[48:20] Interpreter of the scripture the
[48:22] revealer of the word for you and here it
[48:24] is now that I'm showing you that it is
[48:26] going to be because remember his purpose
[48:30] is to bring the people to ignore God
[48:33] totally to destroy the relationship
[48:36] between God and man and then bring that
[48:39] attention to him because he's physical
[48:42] with them because when the job or your
[48:45] work becomes a very physical and very
[48:49] attractive to you then you start
[48:51] ignoring everything else that will give
[48:53] you life is a very uh natural or very
[48:57] sensible thing to understand so now what
[49:00] is it doing it's bringing the people now
[49:02] slowly but surely without the people
[49:04] realizing that hey you get so busy into
[49:08] doing what you do that what is supposed
[49:11] to give you life you start ignoring it
[49:13] one stage at the time
[49:15] the woman now comes about the women
[49:18] start ruling that's why we see the types
[49:20] of Jezebel we see of mystery Babylon and
[49:23] all these things throughout the Bible
[49:24] because at the very same practice he
[49:27] keeps doing it because even the United
[49:29] States as the prophet shows us that you
[49:32] know the church the the people came from
[49:35] a different land in order to worship God
[49:37] freely but then very soon and then they
[49:40] took the woman they put there and and
[49:42] they put Jezebel behind and to to try to
[49:45] lead the things about you see but then
[49:48] Nimrod it says though his mystery is uh
[49:52] though his Mysteries he reveals to the
[49:55] people that sins the great invisible
[49:57] father God does not concern himself in
[50:00] the Affairs of man because people could
[50:03] fall sick
[50:05] people could go into all kind of
[50:07] troubles but they didn't have any
[50:08] solutions
[50:09] then he says but then remain silenced
[50:12] relative to them then it follows that he
[50:16] may well be worshiped in silence
[50:20] is bringing the people now to understand
[50:22] like since God that you worship so much
[50:26] doesn't talk to you worship Him in
[50:29] silence when you go to church you don't
[50:32] need to Rejoice just say that just be
[50:34] quiet just be just be formal you know
[50:38] don't don't don't don't don't express
[50:39] yourself too much because there's no
[50:41] relationship between you and the one
[50:43] that you're worshiping
[50:45] it's a natural uh continuity of fact
[50:47] then he says
[50:49] actually it means to ignore him as much
[50:53] as possible if not all together
[50:58] so he the Creator that was to that
[51:02] created the human beings to worship him
[51:04] now the devil now or Nimrod has come
[51:07] about and started drawing the people
[51:10] away and say like you know just ignore
[51:12] him all together because it doesn't it
[51:15] doesn't give you food but your job does
[51:17] it's a it's a it's a it's a natural
[51:19] thing then but I'm saying I'm still in
[51:23] the programming Church ages it says
[51:25] since it was not necessary to worship
[51:29] God the Creator father it was only
[51:33] natural that that worship sung to the
[51:38] mother and child as the object of
[51:41] adoration in Egypt there was the same
[51:44] combination of mother and son called
[51:47] Isis and Oris or or series
[51:50] everywhere you go in the world
[51:53] either you be from Africa you'll be from
[51:56] Europe or Asia or America
[51:59] everywhere you go you find the same
[52:02] things
[52:03] the relationship between mother and son
[52:06] my mother said my mother said my mother
[52:09] said that Spirit didn't start here but
[52:13] then it started way back there
[52:15] where you see a man cannot emancipate
[52:18] himself but then he's still bound under
[52:21] the shackle of the church
[52:23] The Simpsons The Same Spirit because he
[52:27] understood how can you drive the people
[52:29] away because then we see now that if
[52:32] throughout the land this worship when
[52:35] you go for instance in Africa you'll
[52:37] find that people have all kind of
[52:39] Customs you'll find that you know they
[52:41] have a material called Customs where the
[52:45] children belong to the mother
[52:48] when you go to America you find the same
[52:51] when you go to Asia you find the same
[52:53] and then when the same Nimrod started
[52:56] now evolving it started understanding
[52:59] that well how can I get every every
[53:02] single person under this anointing
[53:04] without them realizing that I am the one
[53:07] because the very next stage after the
[53:10] murder to give birth he has to give
[53:12] birth what to the son
[53:15] because now as the sun is getting ready
[53:17] to come now there must be a way now how
[53:21] to fade the church the woman of out of
[53:24] the scene
[53:25] so now what does it do it comes about he
[53:28] understands it it puts now first
[53:31] Traditions into the people
[53:34] from one part of the world to another
[53:36] when you look in Rome you find that when
[53:39] Christianity came to them what did they
[53:42] do
[53:43] teaches us that in the church church
[53:45] ages he said he lays down
[53:49] uh uh the system I breeded or he put
[53:54] together the
[53:57] Roman Pagan worship
[53:59] with Christianity
[54:01] by blending that together what seemed to
[54:05] be the truth
[54:07] with now the statute and with all the
[54:10] Traditions it Blended together so now
[54:13] the people now everything they can
[54:16] remember is that the worship now swung
[54:20] now to the ancestors
[54:23] so this is where you see from anywhere
[54:26] else everywhere you go in the in the
[54:28] world you find that especially
[54:32] Africa India and and everywhere you can
[54:35] go you'll find that you know they have
[54:37] all kinds of statues
[54:39] you go I believe in the Philippines and
[54:41] in all these countries of Asia you even
[54:44] find that at times they will bury people
[54:47] but then time to time they go and
[54:49] unearth them
[54:51] to try to watch them and said hey these
[54:54] are our ancestors we have to take care
[54:56] of them
[54:57] look at where we started
[55:00] we started with God the Father brought
[55:03] them away showed them like you know just
[55:05] a load of and now is bringing them on
[55:08] this side
[55:09] to save us time then we see now that
[55:13] since now he brought the people under
[55:15] this combination of religion and
[55:18] ancestry worship now it becomes so
[55:21] confusing
[55:22] amen among you can die but we hear life
[55:25] we don't call them sins my brother is
[55:27] not descend but once he dies he becomes
[55:30] a sense
[55:32] it becomes a sense then Brothers says in
[55:35] the message
[55:40] going to uh get it for us here
[55:44] in the message Christianity versus
[55:47] idolatry paragraph 83
[55:50] now when Christianity came to Rome in
[55:54] the very city of Rome had 400 Pagan's
[55:57] temples inside the seven Mill walls
[56:01] 400 Pagan temples and there were the
[56:04] gods and the goddesses God gods and
[56:08] goddesses women and men
[56:14] Gods 400 different ones of them
[56:17] think of it 400 now that's what found
[56:22] when that's what Paul
[56:25] founded in Rome when it came to Rome
[56:28] that's what Akila and Priscilla had when
[56:31] the the they were sent away from from
[56:35] Pentecost and established a church in
[56:37] Rome that's what they came into Pagan
[56:41] Worship in Pagan worship of Idols there
[56:44] was there was around 2 million people in
[56:47] Rome in Metropolitan Rome that's it the
[56:50] slaves and the outside Suburbans and so
[56:53] forth and around to be to 2 million
[56:56] people but the walls around Rome was
[56:58] seven seven miles and and inside of them
[57:02] seven miles right at the foot of uh of
[57:05] the of the mountain was around 400
[57:08] pagans temples to the to uh to to pagan
[57:12] gods and goddesses I'd like to speak
[57:15] here just a moment it on something that
[57:18] I've taken from histories I've got one
[57:21] right here with me the way they entered
[57:25] into worship how did they come to
[57:27] worship how did they how did a pagan
[57:31] come to worship the first thing he did
[57:34] was to was was go to the temple and find
[57:38] the priest
[57:39] the Pagan priest then he would give him
[57:43] a offering of of much money and then a
[57:46] sacrifice an animal to appears the the
[57:49] god that that he was going to speak to
[57:52] and in sometimes
[57:54] in one Temple there'd be more one of a
[57:57] different kind a different kind of God
[58:00] you look an entire world you go to India
[58:03] you have the same thing
[58:05] in one in one country you have the god
[58:08] of nature the god of rain the god of
[58:11] fertility the God of this the god of
[58:13] that you go to to Europe as he said it
[58:17] here you go for a different different
[58:18] places though it's not really as
[58:21] prevalent today but you have to you
[58:23] still have those museums where they show
[58:25] you like you know since there's a sense
[58:27] that sense this sense that
[58:29] and you come to Africa to this day you
[58:32] still have people who who say like you
[58:34] know according to our traditions
[58:38] why because the only thing they can
[58:41] remember for all these times that they
[58:44] were not in touch with the Living God
[58:46] was that they presented to them god and
[58:49] goddesses
[58:51] and the prophet is showing to us now
[58:53] that the people how did they come to
[58:55] worship they will go to a priest because
[58:59] they took the very same pattern where uh
[59:03] are killing Priscilla went to Rome and
[59:04] preached the word and they replaced it
[59:07] with their own uh or their own things
[59:10] and when they brought those things
[59:12] before the people the people said what
[59:14] understand and know like you know this
[59:17] was uh uh uh Beethoven and this was uh
[59:22] such a people and this was such a people
[59:24] I think like if I receive the spirit of
[59:27] Beethoven I can do some of the greater
[59:29] the great music like he did
[59:32] he said that many times when we receive
[59:36] a spirit when we receive that Spirit we
[59:40] will do exactly what that person did
[59:43] previously
[59:44] that's why even when we did just the
[59:47] same way as we don't name uh our
[59:49] children Jezebel not because the name
[59:52] Jezebel is wrong but the life that Jesus
[59:56] believed
[59:57] that brings an anointing that influences
[1:00:00] people that's why program also shows us
[1:00:02] he says
[1:00:04] watch the names that you give to your
[1:00:06] children
[1:00:08] but then today what do we name our
[1:00:10] children after the greatest basketball
[1:00:12] player the greatest man out there the
[1:00:15] greatest you know very influential man I
[1:00:17] want my son to be like such because he's
[1:00:20] he's done a wonderful work and things
[1:00:22] even when we've seen the cars
[1:00:24] manufacturing industry you see that you
[1:00:26] know we can take a name of a great sign
[1:00:29] a scientific and intellectual person out
[1:00:32] there name of a Tesla because they get
[1:00:36] inspired by the life the person lived
[1:00:39] and but then behind it but I'm saying
[1:00:42] said watch out
[1:00:43] that when you are doing that you also
[1:00:47] are receiving a spirit
[1:00:49] but then now that Spirit now will lead
[1:00:52] you into a direction without you even
[1:00:54] realizing where are you headed to
[1:00:57] so now that Spirit as it's leading you
[1:01:00] throughout life you'll think like you
[1:01:02] know oh I've made the greatest
[1:01:03] inventions I've built the greatest
[1:01:05] company and all these things but then at
[1:01:08] the end of the day it doesn't show you
[1:01:11] where your end will be with that kind of
[1:01:14] spirit amen
[1:01:16] amen so now the Lord now wants to
[1:01:18] restore the relationship that's what
[1:01:20] William Burnham says that you know the
[1:01:22] only reason why I'm still worth doing
[1:01:24] this work is not to bring people to
[1:01:27] follow me
[1:01:29] it's not people to follow my to receive
[1:01:31] my spirit
[1:01:32] it's not for people to receive a church
[1:01:34] Spirit but instead to re-establish a
[1:01:39] true relationship between God and Men
[1:01:43] the very something that God destroyed
[1:01:46] for many years the Lord now has to bring
[1:01:49] it to pass to bring it back again but
[1:01:52] then yet at the same time the Lord says
[1:01:54] but then before mid to re-establish that
[1:01:57] relationship clearly people have to know
[1:02:01] people have to know what has happened
[1:02:03] because as when we come to God we cannot
[1:02:06] just show up to God and say like you
[1:02:07] know Lord I'll come back no that's why
[1:02:09] we come with repentance repentance is
[1:02:12] the fact of saying exactly what happened
[1:02:15] without trying to play words like a
[1:02:18] lawyer no according to this you know
[1:02:21] what I didn't really mean no because the
[1:02:24] person himself have to understand that
[1:02:27] I've been separated the relationship has
[1:02:30] been broken because the vow between you
[1:02:33] and your wife for you and your husband
[1:02:35] has been broken because of the event
[1:02:37] that had taken place since that event
[1:02:40] has taken place for you now to
[1:02:43] re-establish now that relationship again
[1:02:46] it's for you to repent by repenting is
[1:02:50] exactly telling exactly what happened
[1:02:52] just as brother Branham uh said that
[1:02:55] dealt with uh a Sunday school teacher
[1:02:58] she had a spirit upon her she didn't
[1:03:00] know what what was going on they prayed
[1:03:03] for her once or twice they didn't work
[1:03:04] then she comes on the the prayer line
[1:03:07] Burnham prays it doesn't work then she
[1:03:10] meets on the road then it doesn't still
[1:03:13] nothing is still happening then she goes
[1:03:16] to to his house they say like well she
[1:03:19] said he says to his wife you say well
[1:03:20] give me a time with her then when he
[1:03:23] goes uh it the vision comes and say oh I
[1:03:26] see
[1:03:27] I see you in such a day you had this
[1:03:29] this and this and that okay this is what
[1:03:32] had happened don't tell that to nobody
[1:03:35] but that's your life
[1:03:38] don't be ashamed of it it has happened
[1:03:42] the relationship has been broken
[1:03:44] the devil has found his way into your
[1:03:46] life
[1:03:47] now the only way for you to come back is
[1:03:50] through repentance
[1:03:52] because the propitiation is already
[1:03:54] presented the blood is already there but
[1:03:59] then the blood is only waiting for your
[1:04:02] repentance first when you come under
[1:04:05] with repentance under the blood then the
[1:04:08] devil has no right to still remain there
[1:04:12] amen because that with that that
[1:04:15] understanding what do we do I'm going to
[1:04:17] force my agenda on the pastor I'm going
[1:04:20] to force my agenda on people I'm going
[1:04:22] to convince my brother or my sister you
[1:04:24] know if people really know this and my
[1:04:27] my reputation you know no
[1:04:30] that devil is is legally bound to stay
[1:04:34] there
[1:04:36] so therefore now what does it go what is
[1:04:38] what is God doing is now showing the
[1:04:41] people what has happened that the the
[1:04:44] reason why you behave the way you behave
[1:04:46] it's because of your culture your
[1:04:50] Traditions your religion has molded you
[1:04:53] into what you are and since now you've
[1:04:56] been molded into what you are then now
[1:04:59] you have to have the understanding on
[1:05:01] your way back
[1:05:03] because whenever preaches the message
[1:05:05] the way back he shows how a young man
[1:05:08] went to war he had a mental issues and
[1:05:12] all kinds of things then to find his way
[1:05:15] back he has to look at the uh at the way
[1:05:18] on the ground it is the same way with us
[1:05:20] today that the word given to us is given
[1:05:24] to us for restoration
[1:05:27] it's not given to us for condemning it's
[1:05:30] not given to us for just destroying but
[1:05:34] the word in whatever form or Shepherd
[1:05:36] comes is for restoration
[1:05:39] because that's why many times when
[1:05:41] people listen to the words like ah the
[1:05:43] preacher was too hard no the purpose
[1:05:46] that at times it has to hurt it's
[1:05:49] because that part has to be kicked on a
[1:05:52] little bit harder because sometimes your
[1:05:54] stubborn Spirit doesn't just accept any
[1:05:57] kind of some form of massage but it
[1:06:01] requires a good punch
[1:06:02] because when Jesus himself went to into
[1:06:05] into hell he didn't go there and said
[1:06:07] the devil like you know uh Mr devil you
[1:06:10] know I paid the price no
[1:06:12] you're self also when you re when you
[1:06:15] understand that you come to the
[1:06:16] realization that hey this is my given
[1:06:19] right this is my privilege I cannot stay
[1:06:23] shackle under this without me realizing
[1:06:26] what had happened Lord this has happened
[1:06:29] husband this is has happened father this
[1:06:32] has happened pray for me until then that
[1:06:37] devil will still be bound there
[1:06:39] Let It Be culture
[1:06:41] Let It Be Your Society let it be
[1:06:44] anything that you're holding yourself
[1:06:46] onto will hold your shackle because in
[1:06:50] our cultures at times wherever we have a
[1:06:53] complex complexes of inferiority of
[1:06:56] superiority you think like you know
[1:06:58] you're better than this and you you're
[1:07:00] not better you you just like you know
[1:07:02] useless person and all that until you
[1:07:04] understand who you are as a Son of God
[1:07:07] the daughter of God then that demon will
[1:07:11] still hold you bound
[1:07:13] because your confession that's what
[1:07:16] brings God now to come to do the work
[1:07:19] because he is the high priest of what of
[1:07:23] our confession
[1:07:24] without your confession you will not be
[1:07:27] able to do anything
[1:07:29] then your confessional makes you
[1:07:31] understand that I have to get into the
[1:07:33] world understand what God has given us
[1:07:36] today and how am I going to get back to
[1:07:40] my original position because we are
[1:07:42] called then we are what anointed then we
[1:07:46] are what place
[1:07:47] without these three stages then there's
[1:07:50] no way for you to be able to get
[1:07:52] anywhere then for you it's just I cannot
[1:07:54] demand live they live the good life you
[1:07:56] had the money he had to build all kinds
[1:07:59] of things but then the next stage after
[1:08:01] your death you just don't know what's
[1:08:02] what's gonna happen
[1:08:04] so now and then sometimes a different
[1:08:06] kind of gods well paragraph 87 so that
[1:08:10] uh so the Pagan priest he would go to
[1:08:13] him and give him some some money and the
[1:08:16] Pagan priests that would would give him
[1:08:18] give him back a candle and a regulator
[1:08:22] Tallow candle and and the worshiper
[1:08:25] taking this candle after he had paid the
[1:08:28] priest taking this candle and goes all
[1:08:30] it goes over to the certain altar of
[1:08:34] this God
[1:08:35] remember he has all kind of gods he
[1:08:39] comes to a priest the priest gives him a
[1:08:41] candle the pastor tells him all kinds of
[1:08:43] stupidity now it takes that now to his
[1:08:46] heart and say like you know the Pastor
[1:08:48] said you know I don't need to tell that
[1:08:50] to my husband because if my if I tell
[1:08:53] her to my husband my divorce is going to
[1:08:54] he's going to be split well after you do
[1:08:57] that we see that brother I'm sure that
[1:08:59] you know that woman in that condition
[1:09:02] that didn't resolve her issue she didn't
[1:09:05] know what was happening with her she
[1:09:07] said I'm a Sunday school teacher but it
[1:09:10] doesn't matter
[1:09:12] your title doesn't matter in this case
[1:09:15] you know all that you are he doesn't
[1:09:17] that's why at times like you know you
[1:09:19] see people years after years in the
[1:09:20] church but they're still spinning around
[1:09:23] they're still spinning around go go back
[1:09:25] to the world you don't go back go get
[1:09:28] into you receive the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:09:30] Ghost you can receive the Holy Ghost why
[1:09:32] because you are stuck inside a certain
[1:09:34] position
[1:09:35] because since that event is place in
[1:09:38] your life now you find yourself like you
[1:09:40] know I can move forward
[1:09:41] forward I can't believe I can't go back
[1:09:43] either
[1:09:44] but then now confession that's what will
[1:09:46] do the trick
[1:09:49] and on this Alto was fire here where the
[1:09:53] where the sacrifice would be burned at
[1:09:55] the foot of the statute and all these
[1:09:57] candidates were up in progress 88 I
[1:09:59] guess
[1:10:00] it's so the certain God amongst all the
[1:10:03] other gods would know just which one of
[1:10:07] the statute it was he was supposed to
[1:10:09] get into you know just as today we have
[1:10:12] people who go you say well I'm going to
[1:10:14] uh uh how do how do we call them uh
[1:10:19] psychiatrists I believe people that you
[1:10:22] go you talk to when you have issues and
[1:10:25] all kind of things you
[1:10:26] what's that aside therapist why yeah
[1:10:30] there you go therapist you see people go
[1:10:32] to the therapist now they say like well
[1:10:34] you know the word of God has no effect
[1:10:36] exactly this is very same pattern to
[1:10:39] this day it still applies because like
[1:10:41] you know one will say like well I don't
[1:10:43] go see I don't I'm not at the altar out
[1:10:45] there looking at at a statute and all
[1:10:47] kinds of things but you go to the
[1:10:49] therapist
[1:10:50] yet you have the word of God with you
[1:10:53] you go you watch the movies well I just
[1:10:55] want to relax a little bit let me have a
[1:10:58] little bit of Netflix
[1:10:59] just as we were sharing with one of the
[1:11:01] fathers the other day and I said like
[1:11:03] you know yeah with the young people now
[1:11:04] today like you know it's all about
[1:11:06] Netflix and chill and things he said
[1:11:08] like you know I don't know what Netflix
[1:11:09] is I say yeah of course you have to
[1:11:11] catch up you have to know what's going
[1:11:13] on with your children
[1:11:15] now they have a different altar before
[1:11:18] them
[1:11:19] because but with them there they had uh
[1:11:22] the altar of uh of TV with everybody but
[1:11:25] now the child doesn't go out anymore why
[1:11:28] doesn't it go out because he has an
[1:11:30] altar right there in the home
[1:11:32] and nobody knows about it the father
[1:11:34] wants to come to the room it's my
[1:11:37] privacy
[1:11:38] but then behind those those closed door
[1:11:41] a whole service of worship is taking
[1:11:43] place that's what the prophet is showing
[1:11:46] us here that's why the word is not
[1:11:48] historical the word is a is a it's it's
[1:11:51] pragmatic it's something that you see
[1:11:53] it's something that you touch you can
[1:11:55] see how somebody growing in the word how
[1:11:58] they're being shaped and how they become
[1:12:00] nicer to everybody how they open how
[1:12:03] they the simple the how they they have a
[1:12:06] welcoming Spirit as we see it with
[1:12:08] brother brother I mean the uh in the
[1:12:10] prayer line they say like you know oh
[1:12:12] sister I see you have a wonderful
[1:12:15] atmosphere around you are you a
[1:12:17] Christian oh brother it is the same Oh
[1:12:20] Sister you're not from this church but
[1:12:22] you're from a very wonderful teacher
[1:12:24] you've been taught the word correctly
[1:12:26] why the very same Spirit of the Living
[1:12:30] God in that church in that home in that
[1:12:33] brother in that sister will reproduce
[1:12:36] the very same thing either you be from
[1:12:39] Africa either you'll be from Europe
[1:12:41] either America wherever you come from
[1:12:44] that Spirit upon you we all going to
[1:12:47] behave the same way but anything else
[1:12:50] outside of that we can only give us the
[1:12:53] understanding not to judge you but to
[1:12:56] make you understand what can the spirit
[1:12:58] is upon you and how to get out of it get
[1:13:02] exposure to the world let be washed by
[1:13:05] the word be transformed by the word in
[1:13:08] order to be ruptured one of these days
[1:13:10] or for us who are alive and remain
[1:13:14] amen
[1:13:16] I believe I'm not running out of time
[1:13:17] amen
[1:13:19] and he would go back there out on the
[1:13:22] floor of the Tabernacle and there he
[1:13:24] would prostrate himself on the on the
[1:13:26] floor and there he would put all kind of
[1:13:28] uh you'll put out he'll put all of his
[1:13:32] souls and his strength into his prayer
[1:13:34] and pray to this great God of some
[1:13:37] Soldier a make-believer a mythical god
[1:13:40] pray to this God to come down in His
[1:13:44] image and talk to him
[1:13:47] the devil
[1:13:49] he said well
[1:13:51] now I've taken you from God the Father
[1:13:56] they said the Dove and the seed now you
[1:14:00] have the statute of Mary
[1:14:02] now let me diversify it a little bit
[1:14:07] since some of you call yourself Buddhist
[1:14:10] okay here's the statue of Buddha
[1:14:13] since uh you are called uh
[1:14:16] probably only the the the Congolese
[1:14:19] Brothers will understand this
[1:14:21] um the god of munama the God of War
[1:14:25] they worship water
[1:14:26] because they see they have a lot of
[1:14:28] water
[1:14:30] and to them is a great mystery what's in
[1:14:33] the water
[1:14:34] when they see the girls are floating out
[1:14:36] of the water they say that's our God is
[1:14:39] rising up to talk to us
[1:14:42] if you get closer to the water you're
[1:14:44] going to die the very same element
[1:14:48] when you brother I'm saying you come
[1:14:50] here in America with the Indians and
[1:14:53] with every and every everybody else even
[1:14:55] when you go to everything else so that
[1:14:57] we call a conspiracy theory today where
[1:15:01] they take the children and they go they
[1:15:03] sacrifice them
[1:15:04] all kind of stories behind what is that
[1:15:07] the very same spirit because even those
[1:15:11] who are kidnapping the children why are
[1:15:13] they doing that to sacrifice that to the
[1:15:15] idols in order for them to remain young
[1:15:18] longer
[1:15:20] and they think that eternal life is a
[1:15:23] matter of sacrifice of a human blood
[1:15:27] no it requires God's blood for you to
[1:15:30] live eternally
[1:15:31] so then the devil now I'm painting the
[1:15:35] picture of it the entire world
[1:15:37] regardless of where you're from what
[1:15:40] you're holding on to what you think that
[1:15:42] your culture your language your all
[1:15:45] these things was only a way for Nimrod
[1:15:49] to destroy and to separate people and in
[1:15:53] order for him to receive all that Glory
[1:15:55] because he was jealous because he saw
[1:15:58] that as something that that hey God is
[1:16:02] creating this I'm his right hand man I'm
[1:16:05] going to inherit all this but then he
[1:16:07] says that all that didn't he didn't
[1:16:08] receive it then all of a sudden say well
[1:16:11] I need to have my plan now but he
[1:16:14] thought but he didn't think himself that
[1:16:16] he was a creation from the Creator
[1:16:19] that the creator also had his own
[1:16:21] thinking and also had his own program
[1:16:24] amen and as and it said that one of the
[1:16:27] Emperors uh I'm going to jump here
[1:16:31] look as Grace
[1:16:34] laughs
[1:16:36] paragraph 1 178 and I've been uh I've
[1:16:40] been to some of the sense of Patrick's
[1:16:43] churches in uh in Northern Ireland yes
[1:16:45] sir I had the privilege of saying that
[1:16:48] it was just a big old Hall they didn't
[1:16:53] have them Idols sticking up and pouring
[1:16:55] out stuff on their feet and paying for
[1:16:57] the people to come in there to come back
[1:17:00] and get in the idol Mary hell Mary Berry
[1:17:04] Hail Mary and Mother of God the same
[1:17:07] thing as deed to astate be bewitching
[1:17:12] the spirit of Mary the very same thing
[1:17:15] everywhere you go in the world you find
[1:17:17] that it is a very same Spirit now the
[1:17:19] Lord now
[1:17:21] he's saying that all these things are
[1:17:24] taking place but he says that well
[1:17:27] God has to come down
[1:17:29] because that's the very that's the very
[1:17:32] element before we get where God comes
[1:17:35] down and what is he going to do and all
[1:17:36] these things we're going to see uh some
[1:17:39] wonderful things probably yeah in in
[1:17:42] another part I don't want to get into
[1:17:44] everything mix up everything otherwise
[1:17:47] it'll be a little bit harder to uh to
[1:17:49] understand the things
[1:17:51] so
[1:17:53] the devil now had to present to the
[1:17:56] people a certain element
[1:17:58] what people have to know
[1:18:00] how are they going to stand how are they
[1:18:02] going to receive how are they going to
[1:18:04] worship they worship through all these
[1:18:06] kind of cultures but then as I stated
[1:18:08] that now we see now that you know in
[1:18:10] many especially in uh what we call the
[1:18:14] Western uh civilization you don't see uh
[1:18:17] all kind of uh you know statutes and
[1:18:20] things anymore but then the devil also
[1:18:23] knew that that was going to happen
[1:18:25] he had to fade away from the people so
[1:18:29] because people had knowledge especially
[1:18:31] in the uh in the Reformation age people
[1:18:34] had access to the books and people had
[1:18:36] access to knowledge and all these things
[1:18:38] but the devil was smart he knew that
[1:18:41] since Martin was was coming with uh with
[1:18:44] the Reformation I still need my people
[1:18:46] with me
[1:18:47] then he introduced
[1:18:50] teaching
[1:18:51] education
[1:18:53] through now education we have a
[1:18:57] colonization and all these things I'm
[1:19:00] not saying it in uh in a historical
[1:19:03] point where you know Africans and all
[1:19:06] these things and all that that's a whole
[1:19:08] nother aspect of the world but
[1:19:11] he wanted to have that
[1:19:14] in order to indoctrinate the people
[1:19:18] to change the way people were thinking
[1:19:22] even unconsciously
[1:19:26] because that's the greatest deceiving
[1:19:28] point you can ever find yourself in when
[1:19:32] you are tricked to do something without
[1:19:35] you even realizing that that's what
[1:19:37] you're supposed to do
[1:19:39] because when Evo found herself in that
[1:19:41] condition
[1:19:42] she looked herself and she said this is
[1:19:45] God
[1:19:46] let me go now and do what to Adam
[1:19:49] teach him
[1:19:51] what it was because the woman the church
[1:19:54] receive a certain teaching receive the
[1:19:57] certain mindset receive the certain
[1:20:00] anointing now she takes that teaching
[1:20:03] now to come and now invade the entire
[1:20:05] Garden of Eden
[1:20:08] you understand the pattern because
[1:20:10] without understanding this button
[1:20:12] quickly that we find ourselves into all
[1:20:14] kind of interpretation like you know oh
[1:20:16] yeah you know really it's not really we
[1:20:19] we don't we don't worship any kind of
[1:20:22] things today yeah we still are
[1:20:25] we still are to this day
[1:20:27] people are still under that such
[1:20:30] anointing then what does the devil do
[1:20:32] just as the neighbor did in the in those
[1:20:34] times it took his face and put it upon
[1:20:38] her Upon Our plate of a plate of money I
[1:20:41] don't know if the brothers have that
[1:20:43] picture of nimrode uh so we can say it
[1:20:46] that Nimrod wanted to propagate his
[1:20:49] teaching all over the world
[1:20:51] when he came about he understood that
[1:20:55] what am I going to do he took the
[1:20:57] teaching and started teaching along the
[1:21:00] reformers
[1:21:02] some of the best teachers
[1:21:04] he said it's a it's a dream that period
[1:21:07] of time
[1:21:08] that we ever know will ever even will
[1:21:11] ever ever uh will never have after
[1:21:14] because he knew that let me get to this
[1:21:17] point he was saying that the time was
[1:21:19] coming to an end
[1:21:21] he was saying that the time was closed
[1:21:24] he had access to the books
[1:21:26] let me have some of the best teachers
[1:21:29] the church the greatest Church who has
[1:21:31] the best schools in the in the land what
[1:21:33] is it the Catholic Church
[1:21:37] some of the best educated people the Jew
[1:21:40] side I believe that it's called
[1:21:42] the best teachers in the world when
[1:21:45] they're teaching you without you even
[1:21:47] realizing you transformed
[1:21:50] you become very smart
[1:21:53] you can do some of the great
[1:21:54] constructions you can do so you can be
[1:21:58] very eloquent
[1:22:00] you wouldn't be like uh Peter you
[1:22:02] wouldn't be like uh uh John and the rest
[1:22:06] of them who couldn't Express themselves
[1:22:08] or write their own names because the
[1:22:11] teaching or education came about
[1:22:14] transforming people about
[1:22:17] people now started becoming like you
[1:22:19] know he's very calm not from the Holy
[1:22:21] Ghost but teaching told them about like
[1:22:24] you know body language it knows how to
[1:22:26] behave he knows how not like you know to
[1:22:29] get himself out of control you know just
[1:22:31] like the Greek would say like you know
[1:22:33] you need to practice self-control you
[1:22:36] know that self-control now shapes the
[1:22:38] person over the years
[1:22:40] somebody who who was a disorderly would
[1:22:44] couldn't just contain himself and all of
[1:22:46] a sudden because of teaching he started
[1:22:49] now becoming calm he said when you come
[1:22:52] before the people this is how you make
[1:22:54] your introduction you know you don't
[1:22:55] repeat yourself as much because people
[1:22:58] wouldn't understand it you know when you
[1:23:00] when you're teaching you have to place a
[1:23:03] board and you make it very pictures to
[1:23:06] them so they can understand and you
[1:23:08] repeat it again at the end now people
[1:23:10] now are absorbed
[1:23:13] into that kind of teaching
[1:23:15] that's why we go to school
[1:23:17] when we go to school whether in what
[1:23:20] position we find ourselves you have the
[1:23:22] men here and you have a bunch of
[1:23:24] students talking in that same way
[1:23:27] because I'll prove it to you even in the
[1:23:29] Bible before going into
[1:23:32] before going into uh into the Excel of
[1:23:36] Babylon
[1:23:37] when they were gathering they were just
[1:23:38] people sitting around about but then
[1:23:41] after they return that's where all this
[1:23:43] came from
[1:23:47] you understand the devil he knew that
[1:23:51] what we have we call as Pulpit it didn't
[1:23:54] exist
[1:23:57] in the Old Testament before departure
[1:23:59] into Babylon but then after the return
[1:24:02] and then they had also a puppet why
[1:24:04] where did they learn it from Babylon
[1:24:08] and when they receive it from Babylon
[1:24:10] now it's now a spread across the world
[1:24:16] because of when God was coming into the
[1:24:19] Garden of Eden he didn't have a Pulpit
[1:24:23] when the Lord speaks to you in your room
[1:24:25] he doesn't need a Pulpit
[1:24:29] whether was God seeking to do either
[1:24:31] trying to give us as much information as
[1:24:33] possible for you to understand it's not
[1:24:37] just the fact of you coming into a
[1:24:39] building called Church
[1:24:41] for you to be in a relationship with God
[1:24:44] because the Holy Spirit met a Philip
[1:24:48] along the way
[1:24:49] because the Holy Spirit met the disciple
[1:24:52] along the road of Emmaus
[1:24:54] but then you have now Christians who
[1:24:57] have been in the realm of the church
[1:24:59] the only time they get in touch they
[1:25:02] feel the atmosphere of God in these four
[1:25:04] buildings
[1:25:05] though the building of course is uh
[1:25:08] given for the purpose of worshiping God
[1:25:11] and adoring him but the relationship
[1:25:14] between God and the people is not bound
[1:25:18] in these four walls
[1:25:21] the devil he knew that when we go to
[1:25:24] school for all you look all the setup
[1:25:26] when you go to work you can have this
[1:25:29] one is sitting at his desk that one is
[1:25:31] sitting at his desk and this one is
[1:25:33] sitting here and you can have a
[1:25:35] conference call all of you are talking
[1:25:37] and all that you don't have to see each
[1:25:38] other but then when you go to school you
[1:25:41] still have the same setup to this day
[1:25:44] because the Devil Knows Why
[1:25:46] that by giving them the teaching in that
[1:25:49] way
[1:25:50] all of them they are attracted to what
[1:25:53] is given to them because we are
[1:25:55] transformed into what we are beholding
[1:26:00] when you sit in front of a movie you're
[1:26:02] watching a movie you are being
[1:26:04] transformed uh slowly but surely into
[1:26:08] that image
[1:26:10] don't know when the tomorrow you know
[1:26:12] just a little bit of this just a little
[1:26:15] bit of that you feel ashamed of being a
[1:26:18] natural woman a natural brother you feel
[1:26:21] ashamed of just having your wife and you
[1:26:23] think that you should have a one two
[1:26:25] three girlfriends out there because
[1:26:28] that started with a teaching some way
[1:26:32] teaching was received either on
[1:26:34] television in the magazines in whatever
[1:26:37] form that is suitable for you
[1:26:40] in the form of music you put it on
[1:26:42] nobody will know who who who who Who's
[1:26:45] the wrong me or I'll pump the music but
[1:26:47] that the demons the spirits behind those
[1:26:50] music will only be transforming you
[1:26:53] slowly but surely
[1:26:56] and uh as no Nimrod was doing that all
[1:27:00] these are strategies is doing is using
[1:27:02] through the media and there was a clip I
[1:27:05] believe online
[1:27:06] where they were showing several Medias
[1:27:09] all of them they were saying the same
[1:27:10] things but they are not from the same
[1:27:12] company they say like you know how's
[1:27:14] this possible oh this is how to control
[1:27:16] the people
[1:27:19] this is how they control the people if
[1:27:21] you open ABC Fox News CNN all of them
[1:27:24] are still taking you to the same console
[1:27:26] culture that's taking you to the same
[1:27:28] this discussion taking you none of them
[1:27:31] is turning you toward God none
[1:27:34] let it be a journal that you will read
[1:27:37] in the morning like you know oh watch
[1:27:38] your routine every morning when I wake
[1:27:40] up I take my book my journal I'm
[1:27:42] subscribed to New York Times Let It Be
[1:27:45] oh I don't really like New York Times
[1:27:47] because they are bought by this or
[1:27:49] regardless of where you're getting that
[1:27:52] information from understand that there's
[1:27:55] only two spirits and one of that spirit
[1:27:58] will take you into a direction where
[1:28:03] very slowly you find yourself like you
[1:28:05] know no this is the way how to behave
[1:28:07] this is the way how to look at Society
[1:28:13] the Lord is taking me differently than
[1:28:15] what I have here but God's grace
[1:28:21] we're going to try to hit a few points
[1:28:24] here before we be able to close
[1:28:28] ancestry worship
[1:28:30] because in this instance you worship who
[1:28:32] has a
[1:28:34] a poll
[1:28:37] came to the city
[1:28:40] oh he found himself he's preaching to
[1:28:43] the people
[1:28:43] and when he's preaching to the people he
[1:28:47] the people look at people in that
[1:28:49] condition looked at Paul they started
[1:28:52] looking at him through the education
[1:28:55] they had received all over the years
[1:28:58] right
[1:29:01] for instance
[1:29:03] if I say brother Mary
[1:29:07] grammatically
[1:29:08] it's wrong right
[1:29:11] anybody that has been to school brother
[1:29:13] Mary if you don't say brother Mary you
[1:29:15] say what Sister Mary right
[1:29:18] because that's what we learn in school
[1:29:21] but then the word comes and say Mary is
[1:29:24] the type of the church in the church we
[1:29:27] have men and women
[1:29:30] education
[1:29:32] and Revelation two different things
[1:29:36] but then depending on what your
[1:29:38] background is
[1:29:40] gives you a perception of the situation
[1:29:43] it's like a reaction to an action
[1:29:46] now
[1:29:47] Paul are coming into the city
[1:29:49] inspiration to the people
[1:29:51] look at Paul they said oh the Gods
[1:29:56] of coming Among Us which gods the ones
[1:30:00] that Nimrod have placed among them so
[1:30:04] they can start looking at this that
[1:30:06] situation as that because the
[1:30:08] relationship between a garden man was
[1:30:10] cut off
[1:30:11] it is the same way today we look at
[1:30:14] brother Branham and some of us turn
[1:30:17] around they say like you know oh it is
[1:30:20] God
[1:30:23] The Same Spirit
[1:30:25] the same way that Nimrod understood that
[1:30:29] hey this how am I going to get these
[1:30:31] people let me remove that slowly but
[1:30:34] surely
[1:30:35] and bring it now to the position when
[1:30:38] now we are even ashamed to have brother
[1:30:41] brought him pictures with us
[1:30:44] why because the education we have
[1:30:47] received that if we have we showing
[1:30:50] brother Branham
[1:30:52] then it's going to be a subject of an
[1:30:56] idol worshiper
[1:30:59] but the nails
[1:31:01] to the Muslim we are other worshiper of
[1:31:04] who of Jesus
[1:31:06] because to them Jesus
[1:31:08] is worthy just a perfect
[1:31:13] do you do we understand that because
[1:31:15] that's what the devil is doing either
[1:31:17] you'll be Muslim Buddha message believer
[1:31:21] Christian whatever you want to be the
[1:31:24] devil is going to try to get to use in
[1:31:26] some form of shape
[1:31:29] it takes the people I I spoke one time
[1:31:32] with uh with with a Muslim
[1:31:34] they say like you know oh you know uh
[1:31:37] people of this uh of uh of of of this
[1:31:40] belief among the Muslim they are not the
[1:31:42] right one because we are the one who
[1:31:44] have received what the prophet Muhammad
[1:31:47] has told us and all these things then I
[1:31:49] sat there in wondering and say that's
[1:31:52] the very same thing we have in the
[1:31:53] message
[1:31:56] it's the very something we have in the
[1:31:58] message
[1:31:58] I say look out the devil despite of your
[1:32:02] religion he wants that attention
[1:32:06] he wants to be worshiping that manner
[1:32:09] we come in the message we start looking
[1:32:12] at brother Branham I was like you know
[1:32:14] no don't talk about brother pranam you
[1:32:16] know
[1:32:17] but Paul tells them he said no
[1:32:20] don't do that
[1:32:22] I am your brother
[1:32:24] I am you and your fellow servant
[1:32:27] and when we get to that understanding
[1:32:29] then we start seeing the separation
[1:32:32] we keep a brother brought them as the
[1:32:34] prophet of the age we love him as he is
[1:32:38] but he is our Prophet but we worship God
[1:32:44] without that understanding
[1:32:46] we are just partaking to the idol
[1:32:50] worshiper either by worshiping brother
[1:32:53] Branham oh we are turning around by
[1:32:57] having by being ashamed of the message
[1:33:00] brought by Brother Branham
[1:33:02] because once you start being ashamed of
[1:33:05] Moses
[1:33:06] then what happens next balam will come
[1:33:09] about
[1:33:10] will come about to say well why would
[1:33:13] you be dressing the way you're dressing
[1:33:16] come to the feast about Pio another God
[1:33:20] their ways treats you better but then
[1:33:23] God knows that if it takes you there
[1:33:26] it's going to destroy you there because
[1:33:28] God has a program remember from the
[1:33:30] beginning that it takes you from one
[1:33:33] position brings you into another
[1:33:35] position but now in between now whatever
[1:33:38] happens
[1:33:40] whatever happens that you have to be
[1:33:42] aware of whatever spirit that you still
[1:33:45] holding on to let it be your cultural
[1:33:48] Spirit Let It Be Your Traditions you'll
[1:33:51] let it be your education all these are
[1:33:53] only forms that the devil Nimrod is
[1:33:56] bringing his worship unto himself
[1:34:02] amen those vehicles that he is using is
[1:34:06] only driving you slowly but surely to
[1:34:09] that worship
[1:34:10] and now to each one of us like you are a
[1:34:13] young man at your level 15 years old 16
[1:34:16] years old your body starts changing you
[1:34:19] start having all kind of also pressure
[1:34:22] upon you that's also another vehicle
[1:34:25] now you have the word of God that tells
[1:34:27] you this is how you ought to be this is
[1:34:29] how you need to dress this is how I need
[1:34:31] you need to present yourself the choice
[1:34:33] again is ours so what kind of choice we
[1:34:36] do are we going to love to look at the
[1:34:39] message and say like well oh brother I'm
[1:34:41] also we I have I see in this picture but
[1:34:43] I'm head this kind of this kind of thing
[1:34:46] that can also do that well remember
[1:34:49] the People based on education look at
[1:34:53] the situation and they wanted to worship
[1:34:56] tall as one of the Gods
[1:35:00] the same way you can be looking at
[1:35:02] Branham and you start looking at him as
[1:35:05] one of the Gods that since he did that I
[1:35:08] can also do it today but then without
[1:35:11] Revelation you wouldn't know why that
[1:35:14] element is there for that reason
[1:35:18] only the revelation will explain it a
[1:35:20] little bit better for you
[1:35:22] because without Revelation what do we do
[1:35:25] we embracing Church
[1:35:28] we're receiving country spirit
[1:35:31] because you go to Africa people are very
[1:35:33] energetic
[1:35:35] you go to the lens where it's very cold
[1:35:38] the people are a little bit quieter a
[1:35:39] little bit calm
[1:35:41] then when you find yourself among that
[1:35:43] type of people you may find yourself
[1:35:46] receiving back on the spirit
[1:35:49] but that doesn't necessarily mean that
[1:35:51] you are converted but you are only drawn
[1:35:54] by education to become that
[1:35:58] education will only teach you how to
[1:36:01] become how to start doing uh
[1:36:04] controlling your emotions and all these
[1:36:06] things but that's not the case but what
[1:36:09] we are talking about here is the Lord
[1:36:11] driving and showing all this element
[1:36:13] because based upon this to close now
[1:36:17] based upon these elements what is it
[1:36:19] what is the devil doing is preparing a
[1:36:22] land
[1:36:23] in order for him to establish his
[1:36:26] kingdom
[1:36:28] and when you start when he's going to
[1:36:31] we'll see that probably next time that
[1:36:33] when he's going out to establish the
[1:36:35] kingdom and we'll see how the a the
[1:36:37] kingdom is being established today
[1:36:40] and what are the things are happening
[1:36:42] today
[1:36:45] because this is this information is good
[1:36:47] yeah yeah I'm getting it yeah don't
[1:36:48] worship
[1:36:50] but there's a reason why all this
[1:36:53] information has to be laid down first
[1:36:55] because now when they establishing the
[1:36:58] kingdom then God has to come down just
[1:37:00] as we read uh in Genesis uh
[1:37:03] Genesis 11 let's read it to the so we
[1:37:06] can be able to close
[1:37:09] amen I believe uh the word
[1:37:13] was a clear enough for everybody
[1:37:17] Genesis 11 verse 3
[1:37:20] and they say one to another
[1:37:22] go to let us you know the reason why
[1:37:26] they're able to
[1:37:27] establish to say to one another
[1:37:31] it's education
[1:37:33] because
[1:37:34] the architect can tell the contractor
[1:37:37] what to do and what to build
[1:37:40] right and if all they have the old
[1:37:44] grammatical structure they can speak one
[1:37:47] language then they nothing can stop them
[1:37:51] and he says here verse 3 and they say to
[1:37:53] one to another Guru let us make brick
[1:37:57] project management you know mineral
[1:38:00] resources
[1:38:01] excavation construction and all these
[1:38:04] things is tied up in that one sentence
[1:38:06] let us make brick right so that's when
[1:38:09] you see all the school system is built
[1:38:11] around let us make brick to do what
[1:38:15] let us make break and burn them thirdly
[1:38:18] and they had break for stone and slime
[1:38:21] her day of tomorrow and they say go to
[1:38:25] let us build build us a city and a tower
[1:38:30] bring everybody together
[1:38:32] have Google translate bridge the gap
[1:38:35] between one country to another you don't

[1:38:44] your Google Google stuff on with you and
[1:38:46] have all kind of uh just what was
[1:38:49] released a few days back Apple Pro
[1:38:51] Vision Pro then you can explore all
[1:38:55] kinds of things
[1:38:56] you understand that and all these tools
[1:39:00] now are being set in place
[1:39:02] to do what to build a city and a tower
[1:39:07] right that will see the next time God
[1:39:09] willing
[1:39:11] and burn them through me and they had
[1:39:14] break for stone and and Slimer they had
[1:39:17] for more and they say go to let us make
[1:39:19] brick and let us build us a city and a
[1:39:23] tower whose top May Rich hunt to Heaven
[1:39:26] just as we see today we want to be
[1:39:29] multi-planetary species
[1:39:31] it's still the same thing to reach other
[1:39:34] planets it's basically the same
[1:39:36] structure here
[1:39:38] oh it seems like not everybody knows
[1:39:40] what being multi-planetary species is
[1:39:42] okay we'll get to that
[1:39:47] um
[1:39:48] I love the word eh
[1:39:50] and they say go to let us build a city
[1:39:52] and who's taught me reach home to heaven
[1:39:54] let us make us a name
[1:39:57] remember three things
[1:39:59] what was that
[1:40:01] the first
[1:40:03] nobody can tell
[1:40:05] what was the first purpose of nimord
[1:40:12] worship second
[1:40:16] religion third
[1:40:18] a name
[1:40:20] okay
[1:40:22] he says like let us make us a name
[1:40:24] unless we discarded abroad upon the
[1:40:27] first of the Earth the whole Earth
[1:40:29] verse 5 I'm going to close with this and
[1:40:33] the Lord came down to see the city
[1:40:38] and we have to see how the Lord is
[1:40:40] coming down
[1:40:41] and it's coming down in a beautiful way
[1:40:45] because we read it like you know yeah
[1:40:47] the the Lord has appeared the picture
[1:40:50] yeah it's wonderful but we want to see
[1:40:52] how the Lord is coming down
[1:40:56] because as the Lord comes down it does
[1:40:59] wonderful things
[1:41:01] it's not just a a mystery anymore
[1:41:04] it's when you see that you say Lord
[1:41:07] I want to be part of this
[1:41:10] Lord transforming into this
[1:41:13] because if we just push you into the
[1:41:15] Lord transforming you it's it's going to
[1:41:18] be like ah going to church like to sit
[1:41:21] there for hours and long sermons and but
[1:41:24] then when you see what the Lord is doing
[1:41:26] how is he preparing it then your heart
[1:41:29] gets excited
[1:41:31] then your heart wants is longing for
[1:41:34] more
[1:41:35] just like our sisters when when they
[1:41:38] know that you know to in few weeks or in
[1:41:40] few months I'll be going to my home and
[1:41:43] you start looking you know if Mama tells
[1:41:46] you something you just like oh Lord what
[1:41:49] day is it again in five days okay okay
[1:41:52] I'll just bear with you one minute by
[1:41:55] the time she just get that exit door
[1:41:56] that's it
[1:41:58] amen
[1:42:00] and the Lord came down to see the city
[1:42:03] and the tower which the children of men
[1:42:07] build it and the Lord say behold the
[1:42:11] people is one
[1:42:12] and they have all one language and this
[1:42:16] they begin to do this they begin to this
[1:42:19] they begin to do
[1:42:21] and now have and now nothing will be
[1:42:25] restrained from them which they have
[1:42:28] imagined to do
[1:42:30] amen but then the picture the entire
[1:42:33] picture that I'm painting to see that
[1:42:36] those three stages
[1:42:37] what Nimrod wanted to do he wanted to
[1:42:40] receive worship he wanted to build a
[1:42:43] strong Nation he wanted to have a good
[1:42:46] religion and we saw tonight how this
[1:42:49] religion is going to it has been spread
[1:42:52] across the world through uh tribes and
[1:42:56] cultures and all these things and all
[1:42:58] these tribes now he has to fade it now
[1:43:01] into education from this education now
[1:43:04] it brings the people now into a common
[1:43:07] ground
[1:43:10] the god
[1:43:12] who had created men after his own image
[1:43:16] and likeness to worship Him
[1:43:20] but the devil has turned the people away
[1:43:24] I Believe by God's grace that as you
[1:43:25] take it you'll be able to see that each
[1:43:28] person each person in his own life Lord
[1:43:30] where is it show it to me
[1:43:33] by revelation
[1:43:35] where did I leave you
[1:43:37] where did I embrace this other program
[1:43:40] because otherwise it's just like you
[1:43:42] know let's join Church let's come back
[1:43:43] and let's go have a service let's have
[1:43:45] worship let's have all kind of knowledge
[1:43:47] but then the Lord now is coming down
[1:43:51] as he comes down he wants to do certain
[1:43:53] things what is he going to do how is he
[1:43:56] doing it what is it why is it what are
[1:43:59] the things that will get into probably
[1:44:01] the news and see how the prophet has
[1:44:04] shown these things in a wonderful manner
[1:44:06] the stage of everything the ministry
[1:44:09] that now the bride has to do and all
[1:44:12] these things but God's grace amen shall
[1:44:15] we pray
[1:44:16] Heavenly Father
[1:44:18] once again thank you Lord for your grace
[1:44:21] and your mercy your kindness
[1:44:24] it's always a pain before coming to the
[1:44:28] pulpit knowing on what direction to take
[1:44:30] but Lord as you have led we know that
[1:44:34] it's not necessarily based upon the note
[1:44:36] because you said take no thought on what
[1:44:40] you shall say at that time it shall be
[1:44:42] given to you
[1:44:43] father as your children have heard from
