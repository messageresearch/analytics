Jesus Christ we pray amen and the church said amen amen amen God bless you this morning it's good to be in the house of the Lord thank you musicians I'm getting a lot of feedback up here praise the Lord I'm sure you can hear that too huh if you have your Bibles with you turn with me to the book of Acts chapter 7 17 and we'll read verse 31 and after that we'll go to John 5 praise the lord we just uh greet you all this morning and uh it's certainly I don't know I don't know how how people do it without the Lord is it any Wonder people are going insane because they have no tie poost they have no anchor they have nothing that holds them in a time of trouble but us as Believers guess what we we got something when we can't hold ourselves when we when we let go of his hand guess what there's still something that holds us and anchors us I'm so glad for that this morning God bless you acts 17:31 and it says uh because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given Assurance unto all men and that he has raised him from the dead and we know that man who he is talking about is none other than Jesus Christ amen The Book of John chapter 5 verses 19- 23 Hallelujah yes amen then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise for the Father loveth the Son and showeth him all things that himself doeth and he will show him Greater Works than these that ye May Marvel for as the father raise raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will amen I'm glad I'm part of Those whom he will this morning for the father judgeth no man but hath committeth all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father he that honth not the son son honth not the Father which hath sent him praise the Lord I want you to uh pay attention there it said that the father judges no man but he gives all judgment onto the son amen you may be seated this morning I would like to title my sermon this morning the Supreme judg amen now when God placed Adam and Eve in in the Garden of Eden there as we know very well the scripture and the stories everything was perfect and and everything ran in harmony all one with another and and God had given them something to stand behind God had given them something to protect them and it wasn't anything to do with themselves it wasn't uh an animal or a lion or a bear or something like that but God gave them his word to stand behind and his word would be their protection and as long as they stood behind the protection of the word they would be fine as long as they stood behind the protection of the word uh they would not fall into sin they would not fall into temptation they would not fall into the traps of Satan but as soon as they would get out from behind the this protection that God had given them we find out that everything fell apart and as they were in the Garden of Eden we see that they were uh naked and they knew it not and we understand that God had veiled their eyes and because they knew not that they were naked and brother brandham said this he said that they were veiled with a holy Veil it was a holy sight it was a holy life because it was a a holy God that they were in the presence of and brother brandham said that that today we are living in an age where it is no longer that people are no longer veiled with a holy Veil but their eyes are veiled with an Unholy Veil and so we see there that concerning this age that the people are lukewarm that people are naked blind and miserable but yet being in that condition that they're in the Bible says that they knoweth it not what a horrible condition it would be to be to be miserable and think you're happy to be naked and think you're closed to be rich but yet you're poor to have everything that you think you need but yet you have nothing because outside of Christ we don't have anything and so the spirit of the age now is an Unholy spirit and we can see it upon the people we can see it upon the people's lives that they're driven by evil they're driven by unholiness they are driven by the things that that Satan is is is bombarding them with why because they are veiled with an Unholy Veil there's no Holiness in them we don't have to look very far till we see the evilness that's within the world today it all starts at the top it all starts with the leaders of the country it all it trickles down from the leaders of the country to the to the to the leaders of the job sites to the business owners it trickles down then to the to the mayor of the city it trickles on down until it comes down to the heads of our very own homes we can see that the the standard begins here and if the people at the top have a low standard everybody below them is going to live a lower standard I say father no matter what the government says no matter what legislations they try to pass let us have the word of God be our standard within our homes and within our lives because the day is evil Hallelujah am so we see they're blind they're miserable and poor they don't even know it it is a spiritual condition and it is also a natural condition that they are in is it any wonder they dress and they act the way that they do is it any wonder that people can get out here and think they can shoot up a school and and take someone else's life and and have and think they have no repercussions of it is it any wonder that somebody can go out here and try to president Trump's life because they're veiled right with an Unholy Veil they're veiled and their minds are so consumed to where they think evil is good good and good is evil they are motivated and anointed and driven by unclean spirits and if we're not careful we get we get so LAX aisy in our own life we get so LAX aisy as Christians to where we become comfortable and we get used to the spirits that are driving this world today God wants us to call good good and evil evil God wants us not to be uh uh uh out here and and and sympathizing with the world he doesn't want us to get out here and say well if so and so says it's okay well I guess that's okay he wants men and women of character he wants men and women of conviction that are going to stand in their convictions in this evil day so we see that the people today are they're motivated by something they are driven by something they are anointed by something and that's the spirit of the devil here we are and Satan's eeden but we're not driven by those things we are not anointed by those things those things do not motivate us in our Christian lives but we are motivated and we are driven and we are persuaded by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit now will motivate us to live a clean life it will motivate us to live a Pure Life it'll motivate us to live a good life a Godly life and try to motivate those and influence those around us to live the same kind of life that's why we are different than them because we are motivated by a different Spirit am we are driven by a different spirit and therefore it makes us act accordingly to the spirit that's within us that's what we're seeing right now we see people out there we see people within Christendom we see people within the message and all of us are driven and motivated by a spirit I say father let me lay down the things of the world let me lay down these unclean seducing spirits and let me be motivated consume me Lord with the fire of your spirit because the holy spirit will burn out all that other stuff in our lives so what are we motivated by we're motivated by the Holy Spirit which brings Holiness and modesty and honesty into our lives did you know that living an honest life is just as important as living a pure life living an honest life is just as important as being modest in how we present ourselves true because little do we know people are watching they're watching us in our lives they're watching us in our business they're watching us in our families they're watching you guys at school they're watching you at work you clock out 10 minutes early or 10 minutes after people are watching honesty I think we're losing honesty amongst us that's right because it's so easy to be dishonest and get away with it true it's so easy to be dishonest when no one else is watching when no one else is looking when no one else sees the brother deal that we're doing well if nobody knows I guess it's okay if I don't get caught I guess it's not illegal nonsense God wants us to be honest in our everyday life whether it be with our family at church in her business whatever it may be true what are we doing in this day we're manifesting in the spirit that's driving us within us I want you to notice now that when God put Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden he didn't put them in this beautiful garden and and and and and put a a a force field around them cuz remember Satan was already cast out of Heaven down to the Earth that's right and so now Satan the Bible says that he walks to and fro throughout the Earth seeking whom he may devour devour as a roaring lion but yet God places Adam and and he makes a byproduct he takes Eve from his rib and he and he makes her because guess what Adam was lonely he wanted a helpmate he he saw all the animals that there were in pairs and and this one was in pair and he saw himself and he said I'm all by myself what is it it's an attribute of God it's not good for a man to be by himself did you know that a man needs a companion a man needs a helpmate someone to help him along the along the road I don't care how Burly he thinks he is how tough he thinks he is if he's going to be a bachelor to the Rapture that's a good way to get married guys start saying I'm going to be a bachelor to the Rapture and you'll chances are you'll get married very quickly typically that's how it happens but we see that God pleas them upon Earth in the garden and he made it so beautiful and and everything was perfect but yet he never built a fence around them to protect them he never put a force field around them to say well Satan you can only come so far you can go this far but you can't touch them because they are my children and Adam was made in my very image and here I have I made a a helpmate for him and and I don't want them to fall and so everything's just going to be perfect and I'm I'm going to cuddle them up and put in bubble wrap and they're never going to go through any Temptation they're never going to have any issues they're never going to have any trials any Temptations no because they're my children it's not what God did that's right but God placed them there and he gave them a word amen and when he gave them a word that word was their protection that word was their force force Shields that word was their Shield that word was their high tower that word was all they needed to stay out of temptation as long as they would stay in the word as long as we'd stay in the word this morning as long as we get behind the protection of the word this morning everything will be okay but we realize when we get out from the protection of the word bad things begin to happen and so now here was Eve man she she already had all the knowledge amen she already knew enough she didn't need to know anymore and so she begins to have a a a a a discussion with this serpent brother brandham says he wasn't a snake with no hips but he could walk and he could talk and he could reason he could talk the same language as what Eve could talk and now they have this discussion one with another and she begins to reason within her mind yeah yeah surely God is a good God and he would never have made me and and and and Adam and placed us here he wouldn't kill us and and and surely surely yeah surely you're right and she begin to reason with Satan over the word of God when we begin to reason the word of God we get out of our position in Christ Jesus because the Bible says without faith it is impossible to please God so whenever we be begin to reason and we begin to try to connect all these dots together by ourselves we are walking in the Devil's Playground a lot of times what I find what I do if I don't understand something I put it on the back burner and I forget about it and a year or two down the line guess what I open my bible or there's a sermon preached and I think wow I remember I had that question I remember I didn't understand that but you see the revelation of God unfolds to us just like brother Mario has been preaching just like he did with brother brandham he does it with you and I so we see a lot of times that as Believers we wish ourselves that you know if I could just go to the woods go up to the mountains get up by myself I'll build a cabin some of your cabins would be better than other people cabins I'll build a cabin I'll get I'll I'll I'll pick a spot beside the water and and and and so on and so forth and and this will just be awesome because it'll just be me and my family and it'll be no one else and we can grow our food and and there'll be there'll be no technology there there'll be no social media there there'll be no internet there there'll be no there'll be no women walking around half naked there there there'll be there'll be nothing there that'll really catch my attention that to take my attention off God there'll be no Temptations oh if I could only do that life would be good but I want you to notice that God has placed you in Satan's Eden for a purpose God did not place you in the mountains God did not place you to be by yourself with your family but God placed you in a city full of Filth a City full of sin a City that's full of evil spirits why would God do such a thing yes very good because he knows that he wants you to be here because he wants you to overcome Satan's Eden the first Eve fail in God's Eden but this eve shall overcome and Satan's Eden am as long as we stay behind the protection of God's word so now God gave Satan the ability and the opportunity to tempt Eve and Adam yeah and he done it and as we are here in Satan's Eden guess what God does the exact same thing he gives him the ability he gives him uh a reason to tempt us with whatever it is that you're tempted with but God has confidence that though they're tempted though they may fall I know they'll get back up again praise God so God G Satan the opportunity to tempt you yeah God is giving you and I this morning in 2024 and Surprise Arizona an opportunity in Satan's Eden yes to tell Satan no thank you Lord no I'm not smoking that cigarette no I'm not drinking that alcohol no I'm not going to smoke the weed that everybody else is smoking no I'm not going to watch that thing on the internet no I'm not going to spend all my time on social media no too much of the time we give in and we say yes and we say yes and we say yes but God is giving you the opportunity to say no to Satan he's giving you the opportunity to say no to Satan's lies he's given you the opportunity to say no to the temptation ations that arise in our lives right here in Satan's Eden thank you Lord but first you got to resist the devil yeah what does it mean to resist something you ever had somebody come and they keep asking you for something you resist them you know how you resist them no no right I'm resisting you no I'm not doing it and O spells no forget it some of you can't say no and that's your problem come on some of you are so far stretched that something else comes up where you should say no you say yes and it gets you in trouble have any of you uh ever of you any of you ever been at work and you're already stretched you already got a full schedule yeah huh you already got a lot going on you already got a lot of jobs going on you got you already got a lot of POS for your boss that you're doing and they say can you do this also the problem is it's going to be after hours oh I did promise my kid that I would take him to the ball game it's at 6:30 I could be done by 6 20 and I can be home nonsense some of you need to say no you know there's some clients that you got you need to tell them no they're the one that you need to resist because they're going to be your biggest trouble right it's true and we get in trouble and entering into uh areas that we're not familiar with oh you're a painter surely you could do this too well yeah I guess I could but I shouldn't but I will and you eat your shorts lesson learned stay with what you know amen stay in the straight and narrow way stay in the word of God and keep your focus why because you need to say no that's [Music] right now is your opportunity to say no I'm not going I'm not doing it I'm not going down that road no well I won't be your friend anymore I don't care amen Big Cheese Sherlock I don't care well I'm not going to hang out with you anymore I won't invite you over to my house anymore I don't care I'm saying no yes the best time to say no to Satan is when you're by yourself that's right because the character of a man is made in his closet that's right the character of a man is made when he's by himself that's right the character of a man is made in his prayer closet you show me a man with little character I'll show you a man with little prayer life and it's when a man is by himself that's when he makes the decisions in his life that's going to mold his character into what he's going to be or what he is amen hallelujah amen we need to say this morning as for me in my house I'm going to serve the Lord I don't care what anybody else does I don't care what happens but as for me in this house and my family in my house I'm going to serve the Lord but too much of the time as the scripture says we are as a dog as the dog that returns to his vomit so a fool repeats his Foley you ever seen a dog throw up and it looks at it and it looks at you then it looks at it and it walks away and then it goes back back to it you let that dog eat that vomit that's the most disgusting thing to turn around from the thing that made you sick right the thing that made you sick to your stomach and you absolutely throw it up and it makes you vomit but yet it looks so tasty now think how God feels come on I'm not trying to be funny think how God feels when finally you get rid of that stuff in your life that doesn't belong there as a Christian you finally throw it up and you vomit it up and God's like praise the lord it's gone but yet a few weeks or a few months later we're returning to the very thing that made us sick and we're licking it and we're eating it up again it's a Grace in the eyes of God it makes them sick put yourself in God that's how he sees us when we return to the things that we once put away a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways God help us to let it to get away from it to let our owners clean it up if it's if it's over by our pen let's not go back near our pen again let's let our owner let's let God the Holy Spirit take take a take a little wipey a detox wipey a Clorox wipe the word and clean it all up and do away with it and throw it in the trash for that's where it belongs don't be a fool don't return to your Folly but turn away from it if you want to be a fool this morning be a fool for Christ so God spoke his word to Adam and Eve and that word was once a protection for them but when they fell from Grace when they fell from the word now the word changeed from protection to judgment he said in that day that you eat that day you shall surely die it was the protection at one point in their lives but when they got away from the word the word turns to judgment yes brother brandham said this in Redemption by judgment 1950 4 now God when he when he loved Adam and Eve so much that he had to First shed blood before he before he could the Judgment was death and something had to die in their stead and then they could stand in his presence now in there was judgment Eve first listened to Satan and he whitewashed the word over and they disbelieved the word and the word then became God's J judgment the word was their protector but when they got out from the protection of the word the word then turned into judgment now we understand that a h h h God had taken a life of an an innocent animal and we see that that that that animal the wrongs of the person was placed upon that animal it was the Guiltless was taking the place for the guilty the grace of God what was it doing something that they did not deserve they they didn't they deserve judgment but yet God's grace now provided a way for them to stand in the presence of God a Guiltless one took the place for the guilty we find in the Bible that there's five types of offerings or sacrifices that Israel brought to the Lord there was the burnt offering the grain offering the peace offering the sin offering and the trespass CL offering now brother brandom told us he said that the number five is the number of Grace and that by these offerings and sacrifices that by the grace of God that it would make a way for his people to get back into his presence but we understand that all of these different sacrifices and offerings they were just a a a a type or a shadow of Jesus Christ himself who would come and give his life at Calvary and bringing us back into the very presence of God Almighty without having the spirit of Christ in our hearts there is no way to come back into the very presence of God but I'm so thankful this morning because God did not leave us there God did not leave Adam and Eve there without making a preparation to come back into his presence but he prepared a away he's prepared a way for us this morning to be in the presence of God by the grace of God by the cross of Calvary I don't think there should ever be a sermon preached that doesn't mention the cross of Calvary the finished work of Jesus Christ of the pain and the suffering and the anguish and the and the torment that he went through for you and I the Guiltless taking the guilt of the guilty upon himself and we can say with the HW writer he became me so that I might become him by his grace in that same sermon Redemption by judgment brother brandham goes on and he says now this word the word of God will judge every person this word is being preached here this morning it's it's being preached down here down there at Wall Street preached over there at a Christian Church down at the Presbyterian Church wherever the word is being preached it becomes the Judgment amen men are judged by the word of God and here's one good thing to know we either we we either our judgment goes before us or it will follow after us so what's he trying to say he's trying to say either we take our judgment now or our judgment is going to follow us at that day of the white Throne judgment either way we're going to be judged I say father let me take my judgment right now I don't want to be standing there upon my own merits but I want to be judged according to Thy word not not upon a man's confession not upon a man's interpretation but upon the word of God you this morning in the congregation you have the opportunity to judge yourselves by the word of God that's being preached amen not just a tradition of coming to church right not just uh well this is what me and my family do we come to church we pay our ties we we we we live as good as we can no we come to church for a purpose to judge ourselves according to the word that's being preached because if we don't judge ourselves according to the word we will be judged by the word paragraph 42 now every man here today doesn't have to be judged at the end he can be judged this morning if he wants to be judged I think that's very powerful because now he places this judgment in our courts amen he places it in our laps if you want to be judged you can be judged if you want to be judged but so much of the time we is we get so carnal within ourselves that guess what we just want to come we want to hear a flower we sermon uh we want to be sang happy we want to be preached happy but we never want sin touched in our lives just leave that alone leave my personal life out of this and what I want to do in my bedroom what I want to do when I'm by myself what I want to do whenever there's no other church people around I can do what I want to do just don't hit that you're judging yourself father I say to take the judgment and to judge ourselves accordingly and to be honest with ourselves because honesty is a part of Christianity and so if we're Christians and we're honest with ourselves they said lord judge me this morning according to Thy word and if there's something in my life that I need to give up father help me don't take it from me but help me Amen to give it to you yes sir for I know if I give it to you and I give it as a you know what it is when you give something to God it's a free will offering sir it's my free will Lord I know it's wrong I know I'm doing that right I give it to you freely you'll not deal with it anymore why because out of the abundance of your heart you've given it to God but if someone tells you to give it sh tell me what to do I ain't doing it here take it I'll just work and buy something else it's amazing how we have that attitude isn't it that's the attitude we have with God let me share this with you guys you know the attitude that you have with mom and dad when they try to help you with situations in your life is actually your attitude that you're having with God sure if they're trying to tell you hey don't go there no more don't do it stop knock it off it's not good for you a Christian ought to be doing that the attitude that you have with Mom and Dad when they're trying to teach you from the scriptures the attitude you're having towards God Amen I guess we could say it's the same with the elders huh let's speak to the elders for a second yeah you got stuff you need to give up and you know it whenever the preacher preaches or wherever your wife or husband says something to you the attitude that you have towards the preacher your husband or your wife is the attitude that you have towards God because it is God using the vessel to speak to the sin that's in our lives right Hallelujah I receive that Lord brother brandham says now of God in order to bring carry and on with that same quote if God in order to bring Adam and Eve into his presence he had to make a preparation now what did that he says if you don't believe in grace Grace provided a preparation I know there's some of you that don't like to read past 1963 but I think this is very powerful 1954 he says Grace provided a preparation oh how happy I am for that Grace provided a preparation Grace is God grace is love God so loved his Fallen creatures that he provided a preparation to stand them in his presence before judgment so before the judgments of God could come to pass pass in their life God already prepared a way for them to come back into his presence again God went and killed sheep and animals put skins on them to cover them up and blood was first made before the judgment and this is powerful the Judgment was through the blood of course and then he shed the blood of the innocent to cover up the guilt of the guilty he said the he said the Jud judgement was through the blood go and listen to the whole sermon I listen to it throughout the week it's it's a it's powerful what does he mean by judgment through the blood he means that Jesus Christ that our judgment our guilt our shame our trespasses our faults and our failures everything that we could name is all under the blood so the blood are Jesus Christ became our judgment and so the Judgment Hallelujah was made through the blood it was the grace of God that made a way for Adam and Eve to stand in the presence of God before judgment kicked in it was the grace of God that prepared a way for Noah and his family before God struck the Earth with the Judgment of water God will always give a warning before he sends judgment because he is a just [Music] God he gave a warning to lot and his family of the impending judgment that was coming to Sodom by the two angels you know where Sodom where lot got mixed up in Sodom the Bible says that that he sat at the Gate of Sodom and in other words lot got caught up with the political issues of Sodom he was a gate he was a judge at the gate he got caught up with L AIA he got caught up with things that he shouldn't have been getting caught up with as a Believer and because of this his heart turned hard and when the angel of God the two angels came to uh uh to get him and his family out there he was hesitant you got to be kidding me here you have two angels God is preparing a way for you God is showing grace to you you've made all these wrong decisions but God is is still a graceful God and and he's trying to prepare a way for you to get you out of here but yet you're you're questioning but yet you're holding back saints of God we ought to stop holding back we ought to we ought to get start getting a little bit more uncomfortable here in louia cuz I feel like we're too comfortable we're we're getting a little bit too lukewarm for our own good hop out of the nest yourself before God has to make it uncomfortable for you to hop out Hallelujah so it was the grace of God he he he made a way for a lot he gave warnings through His prophets to the children of Israel and he would tell them if you don't repent if you don't get right if you if you don't take down the go the Graven altars and this and that and the other uh there's a judgment coming your way you're you're going to be taken into captivity you're going to go into Babylon you're this that and God sent Prophet after Prophet after Prophet but yet because of the hardness of their hearts they would not listen it's not just a story it's not just an example but we can put our place our names Our lives our family within that scripture and say father how many times have you warned me how many times have you told me not to do that or go here or whatever it might be but yet I've done it but our hearts gets hardened instead of us softening our hearts and coming to our God and saying father forgive me yes in that same sermon brother Bram says this he says that the best way to stop the judgments of God is a quick repentance just like Hezekiah here is Hezekiah he's on his deathbed God sends uh Isaiah to him and says you're going to die and he turns his his face to the wall and he cries out to God and he goes oh Father uh I I I need 15 more years I need 15 years I'm to get my house in order to get my family's life in line and God give him 15 more years because his motive was this it's going to take me that long to get my family in line can you imagine he was a king so I'm sure he had many kids but it was going to take him 15 years the Judgment was already cast upon him he was going to die but God saw the motive in his heart that father is going to take me this long and that's why God told Isaiah go right back in there and tell him you got 15 more years did God change his mind about him dying did God change his mind about the Judgment that was coming on his life no but because his motive was right in his heart God heard his prayer that's a good example for you and I we think about things and we and we pray about things and we have questions about things but what is our motive behind what we're doing in sing what is our motive behind what we're praying to God and asking him about because if our motive is not correctly God will not answer that prayer but if we have the right motive and we have the right objective and we have the right approach to God and we have the right approach to one another guess what God will hear our prayers and our fellow servants in the body will listen to what we have to say but if our approach is wrong if our motives are wrong the outcome is going to be wrong we have to be so careful saints of God let me speak from my heart now we have to be so careful to keep respect for one another true you know I'll share this brother Elias we was up hunting the other week up in Flagstaff and and it was nice it was more of like a I took my family camping and then took them hunting with me and and uh it was fun got the kids in the car and and and we were you know Road hunting 101 man man it's it's uh it's the best and um and especially when you're not too worried about getting something you don't really care it's for the kids right so the boys man they let this little bonfire and let this little fire and I thought wow that's pretty good and it got so big so all of a sudden I was like well I better go sit beside the fire because it's getting kind of big and out of control here so I sat down and brother elas was there and they came over and sat next to me and and we were just talking one with another and he asked me a question he said uh brother Steven when is it okay to call you brother Steven and when is it okay to call you Steve I said that's a fantastic question because it's a question that we all wonder my name is Stephen everybody here calls me Steve and and and and that's my name so I don't get offended when people call me by my name and I'm sure you're all the same way my answer to brother Elias was this I said whenever we're in a church setting and we're at church or we're around church folk or whatever call me brother Stephen because it's a respect thing sure and it lets everybody else see that you respect the office within the assembly and I was like you don't want visards visitors to be around and and you go hey hey Steve hey let me show you the deer that I shot you know brother Elias can't wait to tell me that you guys don't understand that joke I can't wait to see say that either Elias and everybody else is watching and they're like wow this guy has absolutely no respect for him isn't he his brother but when we're at a family get together and we're camping and it's lowkey hey Steve is good right but I was happy and I was pleased by him asking the question because he knew he said you know what uh we were out here and I said Steve in front of everybody and I got a little convicted so then I said brother Steve and it just didn't feel right where we were at so which one is right well they're both right in different instances very good and so it's so easy for us as Believers to lose respect one for another true we get so familiar with each other Rocko used to tell me all the time familiarity breeds content a we get so familiar one with another it's just like family we get so close and used to each other and and and all of a sudden it breeds content in our lives between us if you lose a respect for your wife and you lose talking to her respectfully it's going to breed content if you lose respect for your husband go figure it's going to breed content in your marriage young people if you lose respect for one another and your parents is going to breed what contempt if you lose respect for the deacons trustees soundmen musicians song leaders preachers and Pastor if we lose the respect one for another it breeds content in our lives let me admonish you this morning my brother and my sister don't lose respect one for another true the Bible says for to treat the Elder women as mothers that's respectful yes that's right to treat the younger as sisters and brothers and to give those the Bishops who have ruled over us double honor yes wow yes put myself in there preacher give me one and a half even when I don't deserve it as a person respect the office that's true because in respecting the office you're respecting God that's very Hallelujah somebody give the Lord a hand clap of [Applause] Praise so we see here that that God sends a warning before he sends judgment and we've already talked about lot and we we can go down through the scriptures of the different uh uh uh uh prophets and apostles and so on and so forth and we realize that God has sent us a message in this day and it it is a message of warning it was a message of warning of come out of her my people and be not partakers of her of her sins and of her trespasses he he told us who the this mother Harlot was he told us who this the the who her daughters are he told us the system that's behind it he told us and he warned us of the spirit behind organized religion he didn't just tell us this for no reason he was warning us because those systems are coming into judgment and so he's saying come out of her my people be not partakers of her judgment because I'm going to set you aside because my bride cannot be judged so it's a warning it's a declaration what is he doing he's warning us to come out of sin to come out of loud here to come out of Church organization and to come into the word because the word is where our safety is we've been warned to apply the token to our homes we've been warned that the coming of the Lord is drawing nigh to get ready and to trim our lights and so we are so far down the road now that we are without excuse let me join my voice with the all other voices that have went on of the warnings that we have before us God is not going to let you get by with sin in your life without bringing you to judgment in some kind of way in this life if you're a son or a daughter of God God ain't going to let you get away with it he ain't just going to sit by and and and say it's okay and tap you on the back and say uh well I I'll have Grace on you it's all right no no no no no no the grace of God provided a way back into the presence of God that's true straight line Grace and I'm so thankful for it this morning because he paved a way for my life he paved a way for your life when you were lost in sin and on Highway to Hell gu what God did he provided a sacrifice for you the Guiltless for the guilty the sinless for The Sinner and he provided a way back into his very presence in this end time through the message of the hour by sending a Vindicated Prophet to do what to prepare you Hallelujah for his soon coming oh you talk about Grace amen but he's not just going to stand by and let you do and get away with anything that you want to do why because he's a just God and when we get out from behind the protection of the word there's nothing left but judgment for us judge yourselves this morning in the sermon the voice of the sign uh 1964 notice sign what does the sign do the sign is to attract the attention and get the elected ready amen hallelujah I want to slow down in this because you just read it and you lose it what's it to do is to attract the attention and what get the elected ready what's it doing it's grace of God providing away for his soon coming he says uh to get the elected radi and out of the way before judgment strikes that's what Noah did got the elected lady the red to them what does it do the sign and the voice of the sign condemns the unbeliever and gets him ready for judgment it gets the elected ready for the Escape that's what sign is that's what signs are given for for the coming judgment to the elected they see it like the little woman listen to this the little woman with a pure heart and a defiled body and the Pharisee with a pure body and a a defiled heart which one are you this morning I know this I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell among people with unclean lips but my [Applause] heart it's all about your heart the very judgments that saved Moses condemned the world his preaching it gets the elected ready what is the elected ready for when they see a godsend sign they look back in the scripture and see if that's supposed to be there yeah here it is what is it pending judgment then the elected listens to the voice what is different about us and Joseph Smith and the Mormons they believe God sent the prophet they believe in God they believe in the word that the prophet sent so what makes our Prophet different than their Prophet I'll tell you what makes them different our Prophet points us back to the word he tells you the signs of the times he has a sign that attracts our attention and he says go back and check it with the word of God cuz the word is our absolute go back and check it with the word and if it's in the word it's true amen amen what did Joseph Smith do wrote a new book he wrote a new Bible he wrote a new book of living He yeah he saw angels and stuff too whatever but that book did not bring us back to the scriptures anything that takes us away from the word let me say this is Antichrist it is not spirit-led man of God because Spirit men spirit-led man of God man sent from God will always take us back to the word so what has the grace of God done for us it has prepared a way for escape uh escaping the judgments of God that's going to strike this Earth and because we've been forewarned it makes the judgments of God just because God will not bring a person to judgment without forewarning him works his faith expressed paragraph 252 brother bradam he says it was revealed to me I was going to Arizona and there I'd meet seven angels and we know that before brother Brandon went out there there was uh six people that had uh that that had dreams six is the number of men but the seventh one was a vision from God to brother bradam himself of this blast that would took place so here we have God is completed in seven and he's got the six dreams now the seventh that is completed it's time for him to go out to Arizona because he has this vision of this of this Mighty blast that's going to take place and he doesn't understand it he says I was going to Arizona and there I'd meet seven angels and they would tell me oh a a message that I was to preach and that was the Seven Seals he says it happened how many remembers me saying that the tapes and things recorded it and it happened magazines everything else took the picture of it that light there in the air they can't even understand it yet there it was I remember brother Jack and uh calling brother Jack and asking him about that Christ being standing there and brother Jack said that's in his glorified State we know that he's talking about Revelation chapter one where brother Brandon where the Bible says that there he stood uh with white hair as wool and so he's asking this brother and he said hey what do you think this means and and and he begins to give his own understanding and brother Jack says that's in his glorified state seat I love brother Jack he's one of the best theologians I know of but I just couldn't hit it just right I was standing there I said Lord how is this young man here I said with hair like wool and he said he is wigged watching the book before it ever happened I I said that and that day when that happened it went up and then you turn the picture sideways if you got luk magazine Our Life Magazine turned sideways there he is just perfectly Hoffman's head of Christ looking right down where I was standing there it is in the magazine how many how many's ever seen it sure of course you've all seen it looking back proved exactly the Revelation was correct why wig why the old English judges the Jewish judges they would wear a wig they do yet in England that's supreme authority he wears a wig and that showed him standing there wigged by Angels Wings he is the Alpha and the Omega he is the Supreme judge none other but him he is to look upon as Alpha and Omega there he was a young man no or more 30 years old wearing a white wearing a wig of white showing that he was Supreme God the father has committed all judgment onto the hands of the son Hallelujah the Revelation is never wrong speak it anyhow no matter what it sounds like goes right with the word so now it's it's it's it's changing brother brandom is pulling this this our opening scripture in with in with this cloud and he's saying that that now this the the Judgment the father is not going to judge anybody but the judgment is giving given onto the son and so now he sees him as Hoffman's head of Christ in this pillar of cloud with this white wig on and now brother brandham is tying this together and he's saying here's the Fulfillment of the scripture here's the Fulfillment of John chapter 5 whatever verse it was here is the Fulfillment of Revelation chap 1 there he stands as a judge with this white wig on the white is a representation of righteousness it is a representation of supreme Authority because he is now the Supreme judge God does nothing on Earth until he declares it first in the heavens so now he sees this cloud and he receives this revelation of these Seven Seals how can J how can God judge somebody from a closed book open the book and tell me what I'm being judged for I can't do it because it's sealed with Seven Seals it's a it's a closed book but now the dispensation is beginning to change and God declared it first in the heavens now that he's I'll say this that Mercy is still on the throne because when the last Son of God takes their position within the body then the Rapture goes because he steps off of The Mercy Seat there's no more blood there's no more mercy and he comes forth as a judge declaring it in the heavens first of a changing of dispensation what is beginning to happen times are beginning to change he is now beginning to make his move from lamb to lion from Mercy to judge but I want to say this morning that there is still hope am there is still mercy upon the mercy seat for you and I and I am thankful for that but it lets us realize exactly where are we at my brother my sister where are we at in the time piece of God the dispensation is beginning to change the Gentiles dispensation is about over God is going to move to the Jews we see Israel at War we see uh Russia we see Russia starting to send fighter jets over uh over uh Alaska and our Administration was scrambling to get fighter jets up there we see that the US is and the West is now uh NATO are now allowing uh long range missiles in Ukraine to reach into Russia what is happening before our very wondering eyes I thought it was I I I watched a little video on Putin the other day and uh you know I'll I'll give President Putin this he's a man with a backbone he won't cave I kind of like that and and and he got some attributes about him that's pretty good comparing to some other countries you ever see that uh you ever see that that picture and and and Putin has his shirt off and he's got his army camps on and stuff and I don't know if it's photoshopped but he's ripped he's got a sixpack and everything and and Obama had a little [Laughter] kitten I don't know if it's photosho but I thought it was pretty good but we look and we see the signs of the times and the wars and the rumors of wars and Putin President Putin said this he said uh he said you know these NATO guys or these Ukrainian guys don't even know how to use these these missile launchers because it's all by satellite and I begin to wonder and brother brandham said the judgments of God is hanging in the skies atomic bombs he says that are directed by satellites where are we at we're at the end time so we see then now that God has provided a way for us to come back into his presence before the judgments of God are passed in our lives he who was judged he who was judged as the guilty though he was Guiltless he who was judged as a sinner though he was sinless the he who was judged with the weight of the sins of the world on his shoulders has now become or is going to become let me say that the Supreme judge with supreme authority John chapter 5:22 it says for the father judges no man but hath committed all judgment onto the son as the musicians come I'll read this quote and I'll close the PMA Vision brother brandham says Nathaniel said onto him whence knowest thou me and Jesus answered and said unto him before that Philip called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw thee there it is when he comes that word will come against all nations and all men and none will be able to stand against it it will reveal what was in every heart as he did with Nathaniel the word of God will show who did the will of God and who didn't it will make known the secret works of every man and why he did them it will divide aunder that is what it says in Romans 2 and3 and thinkest thou this oh man that judges them which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the Judgment of God then it goes on to say how God is going to judge men here it is in verses 5-1 17 the hard and penitent heart will be judged The Works will be judged the motives will be judged this is in every person there won't be any respect before God but all will be judged by that word no one escaping it those listen to this those who heard and wouldn't listen will be judged by what they heard those that rested in it saying they believed it but didn't live it wow will be judged every secret will come out in the open and be shouted from the housetops oh we will really understand history then there won't be a mystery left from all the ages I want to ask you this morning where does judgment begin begins at the house of God Amen I want to say that this building is a house of God it is a place where we come and it's a place where we worship it's a place where the word Goes Forth and it judges the people but the ultimate House of God God where the judgment begins is right here don't you know that you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost don't you know that you are a a a a a dwelling place for God that this natural man that I am it contains the very Zoey life of God himself and so the Judgment of God begins right here in the heart of every believer in the heart of every non-believer and in the heart of every makeb believer so the word has gone forth this morning and some of you might say well brother Steven I thought the bride doesn't go through judgment that's at the white Throne that's not now now we want to receive our judgment and now we want to judge ourselves according to the very principles of God's word and the message of the hour so what are your judgments this morning upon yourself not upon what somebody else says about you not upon what the minister says or anybody else thinks but what are your judgments upon yourself what are you going to do with this Jesus called Christ what are you going to do with the word that is being preached here today how are you going to judge yourself it's all bow our heads this morning the Judgment doesn't belong to your fellow neighbor but your judgment belongs to yourself in your house of God perhaps there's somebody here this morning and you would like to raise your hand not to me but to God God bless you young man God bless you look at that hands everywhere God bless you and you would like to say father I judge myself according to your word and I see Lord where I've been falling short I see father where I've been losing my focus to the things of louia and everything that's going on but Lord this morning I want to dedicate my life back to thee for a life of service and say father forgive me of the things that I've done I'm starting over again God sees those hands this morning God richly bless you let's pray together father Lord you see the hands and more importantly you see the motive and the Heart behind the hand that was raised father God I pray that every sincere heart that has defied gravity here this morning and are judging themselves according to your word Lord would leave this place like we heard our pastor say this morning not as a forgetful hearer but father we would take these things and write them upon the tables of our hearts Lord that we would remember the work that you've done here Lord and how you've convicted Our Lives father and Lord I even raise my own hands Lord because your word is a two-edged sword it's just as good for me as it is for the people in the congregation and I judge myself father according to Thy word and thy precepts and I pray Lord Jesus Lord that you give me strength and that you would help me Lord to fight the good fight of faith and father to lay aside these these sins and these things that so easily beset us and that we would run this race Lord this last little piece of this race the finish line is before us Lord help us to run Lord with with an authority father with the word of God hidden within our hearts I commit these people and myself to you Lord do with us as you seem fit we thank you for your word in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen create in me clean let's all stand together

brother Mario Wednesday night good preaching we've been hearing some very good preaching amen this message brother Brenham said is becoming clearer amen and clearer amen he said the bride the only judgment that she will see is now and it is a self-judgment she hears the word judges herself comes gets convicted said Lord forgive me comes under the blood and she is cleansed by his blood as though she never did it foolish virgin here's the same word doesn't come under the Judgment doesn't come doesn't live it and therefore is going to be left and she will go through judgment when will that be tribulation three and 1/2 years she'll be judged when the Rapture goes blood is off of the earth there's no more Mercy you've passed from mer Mercy to judgment I would say that each one of us here would say oh oh God let me not be judged in Tribulation let me be judged now at your house here by [Music] myself I didn't come here to see how good I am I came here to see where I lack you say well I've got problems I've got issues Jesus said I did not come to those who do not need a physician [Music] it's time of judgment now yes the word Supreme judge he said they took the picture we didn't take it he said there I wasn't looking at it right he said Elias turn the picture he said there he is oh my god there he is supreme judge the white hair of his wig the angels made the white hair of his wig do you see it there in the midst of a consolation of seven angels amen is Christ the word return back to the church that's our judgment that's why when we heard those say our lives we say oh God oh God I bring myself under that judgment amen and Lord forgive me for my unbelief forgive me of my complexes forgive me of my mortality forgive me of my [Music] Humanity the Bible says if we confess our faults that's right he is faithful and just to forgive us amen I think everyone here could raise her hand and so said Lord I confess my faults this morning and I say I I i i i judge myself right here and I'm saying oh God let there be Mercy not judgment so therefore father I come under that because of conviction in My Heart Lord let me not be foolish this morning let me not be foolish let me not be found among the foolish but among the wise that hear the word and they go and do it isn't that your prayer let's bow our heads father God I thank you for this word yes I thank you Father that you sent a word and it heals the people but that word revealed in its season also brings the Judgment oh God how close are we we see hell has enlarged itself Spirits coming 200,000,000 demons released out into this world yes and they in the world are doing The Works of their father he was a murderer a liar a deceiver in the beginning his people will do the same but father there is a voice in this last day a voice of a seventh angel who said come out from among them and be ye separate Lord God wants you separate he don't want you to look like them to act like like them to talk like them or to be like them in any way for if you love the world and the things of the world the love of God is not even in you father I thank you for your word I thank you for the Holy Spirit which brings conviction I thank you Father for the convicting power of the Holy Spirit among each one of us Lord that's still Small Voice that's encouraging us causing us to come up higher and yet father how many times have we crouched that little voice have we uh in some way as your Prophet said there are so many voices in this end time I doubt there'll be very few that will hear the true voice of God but we have confidence in this that and he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the church I have confidence Lord that every elect seed here everyone predestinated to hear to be quickened by this voice in the end time and when they're quickened the administration is changing from one voice to a voice of many Waters yes Lord and they under the administration and the anointing of the end time voice they add their voices together and they under that Prophet become the final voice to the final age this is the final chapter he said there'll be no historians need to write the history because there'll be no one here to read it father we know you're closing the chapters of humanity and everything that you're Bible said would come to pass has either come to pass or is in the process of coming to pass father I thank you and I love you and I thank you for or conviction that comes upon each heart where we see our faults our failures let us then be quick to say I'm wrong that's why King David was a man after your own heart not because he was without sin not because he didn't commit murder adultery and all of those things that's not like you God that's man but when he was corrected by a prophet and told him said David you're that man David became under Judgment of his own words that man is worthy of death and yet he turned around and he cried oh God have mercy father that's what we do that's what we've done this morning we saw I'm that man I'm the one I'm why you went to Calvary I'm why you sent a prophet I'm why you did all these things and I judge myself father let us not judge others lest we be judged but let us judge ourselves righteously father I thank you and I love you I thank you that we have an advocate before the father that when we do things wrong then we are convicted in our heart we say father forgive me put it in the sea of its forgetfulness never to be brought up again Lord oh Father I thank you and I thank you for sermons like this
