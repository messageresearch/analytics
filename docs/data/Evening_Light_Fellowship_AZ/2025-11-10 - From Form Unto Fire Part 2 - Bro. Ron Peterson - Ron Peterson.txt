So I remember Sister Victory says she has flu-l like symptoms. Please keep her in prayer this morning. Ron gave me a request here for brother Eric Andress. He's having knee and hip pain. He can hardly walk. So let's remember the Eric in prayer as well. We have a unspoken prayer request for Sister Becky Page. Lord knows what that need is. Do you have a need this morning? Just want to lift it before the Lord with Randy if you would count. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Let's all bow our heads. Gracious Lord, we first give you thanks that you made a way that we could be here today, Lord. And we're standing on that rock of a revelation, a seed you put in our heart, Lord, that &gt;&gt; there's a promise at the end of this. &gt;&gt; Lord, we don't know what lies before today and the end of all this, &gt;&gt; but our faith is going to see us through. Lord, &gt;&gt; to the world, it might not look like much. Why do you believe that? Why do you do that? Why do you stand? Why do you women dress that way? Why do you Lord, you chose us. &gt;&gt; That's enough for my faith. &gt;&gt; It was your choosing, &gt;&gt; Lord. I want to believe today [music] you chose today, Lord, to strengthen us, to draw us closer. Lord, turn these prayer requests into praise reports. We thank you for all you're doing, what you've done. Lord, I pray that you'd somehow just lift us up a little higher, Lord. It's not by strength, not by might, but let your sweet spirit, Lord. Lord, sometimes we want you to change our situations, but Lord, change us. We look to you today. Ask you'd bless the preaching of the word that every heart could receive. May we walk out the doors different today. We ask for your glory, Lord, not for anything else, for your glory in Jesus mighty name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Andy. You may be seated this morning. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. Welcome each one, those of you streaming the service this morning. Welcome our visitors.

I'll praise him anyway. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have to wait on the Lord and trust in him. &gt;&gt; It's in those times of testings that &gt;&gt; we find victory through our praise. Let's all stand and been thinking of this song. Gratitude. So much to be thankful for. Words fall short. All I have is a simple hallelujah. But Justin, if [music] you'd help sing the verses this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh my [singing] words. [music] &gt;&gt; I've done [singing] nothing new. How could I express all my gratitude? [music] Oh, I could sing these [music and singing] songs, &gt;&gt; as I [singing] of [music] every song must stand. Lord, [music and singing] you never knew. Oh, [music] so I'll go [singing] my hands and praise [music] you again and again. [singing] Cuz all that I have is [music] a hallelujah. [music] [singing] And I [music and singing] know it's not much, but I have nothing else for a king [music] except for a horse singing hallelujah. [music] Hallelu. [singing and music] [music] I got one response. &gt;&gt; I've got [music] just one good with my arms stretched wide. I will worship you. So I throw up [singing and music] my hands and praise you again and again. [music and singing] Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. [singing] [music] And I know it's not much. I'm nothing else fit for a king except for a heart singing hallelujah. [music] Hallelu. [music] [singing] Oh, [music and singing] so come on my soul. Don't you get shy on me. Lift up your song cuz you got [singing] a life [music] inside of those lungs. Get up and praise the [music] Lord. [singing] [music] So come [singing] on my soul. Don't you get shy on me. Lift up your [music] song cuz you've got [singing] a lion inside of those buns. Get up and [music] praise the Lord. [singing] I [music] said, "Come on, my soul.

So I'll put my hands and praise you [music and singing] again and again. Cuz all that [music and singing] I have is a hallelujah. [music and singing] And [music] love is not much. But I have nothing else for a king [music] except for a heart singing [singing] hallelujah. [music] Hallelujah. [music] Pour your spirit [music and singing] out on me. All just like the rain. [singing] [music] Saturate my thirsty soul. [music and singing] Come and fall aresh on me. fill my [music] cup again. Fill my [music and singing] heart and make me whole. [music] I [singing] need you now. Pour your spirit. &gt;&gt; Lift your hands to him as we sing it again. [music and singing] Pour your spirit out on me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; his life on rain.

[music and singing] I need you now for your spirit. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Bow our heads together this morning. If you have an unspoken request and you didn't get a chance to write it down, remember he is a God &gt;&gt; that can even hear the thoughts and intents of your heart. &gt;&gt; He knows what you're going through. So if you have a need and you'd like God to meet that need, would you just raise your hand right now? Say, "Lord, remember me as I Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, you see those hands and you know that every hand is a representation of a need. And Father, we bring our needs, our petitions before you and we have confidence in you, Father, that you know what we have need of even before we ask. But father, it is upon our hearts to ask because if we don't ask, it can't can't be given. Therefore, Father, let us activate the promises. Let us activate those things that we have need of by speaking to the storm, speaking to the issue. Father, I pray that you will bless each and everyone. Bless the ministering of your word this morning, Lord. as we just wait upon you and ask you to be with us. &gt;&gt; We ask it for your glory in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Turn around, shake somebody's hand, say, "God bless you." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You can be seated in the presence of the Lord for just a a moment. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was glad when they said unto me, "Let us go to the house of the Lord." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. No place I'd rather be &gt;&gt; than right here with God's people &gt;&gt; hearing God's word. Amen. We greet you all this morning in the lovely name of Jesus Christ. Amen. We have here with us a missionary whom some of you may not know, but it's Brother Null Johnson. And and Brother Null is actually the first brother. He and his wife, Sister Shirley, was the first ones we met when we came from up in Oregon and was headed to Tucson Tabernacle for the first time to meet believers outside of our little group. and brother null. Uh you and your wife took uh my twin brother and I and Mitch Buckingham and I believe Tom Weathers came down uh at that time and you let us sleep outside of your trailer there and uh took care of us. So he was the first one that we had met and so we go back a long ways. Brother Null, I would like you to come up here please and say a few words. He is a missionary that when you talk about a a real missionary, he goes out and um he goes to places like India &gt;&gt; and he goes there for weeks at a time and his schedule is so full that he'll he'll preach 15 times and 10 days or something like that and have train rides and and cars and this and that and uh but a real missionary and some uh time when we get over there into heaven they'll There'll be different ones that'll say, uh, Lord, when did I do this for you? When did, uh, and whatsoever you've done to the least of mine, you've done unto me. I believe that Brother Null is one of those unsung heroes that you may not hear about, but he goes out and wins souls for the glory of God. Brother Null, would you come and greet the saints here this morning? And we greet you and we love you, brother. &gt;&gt; Bless you. &gt;&gt; I want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And it's been my privilege where God allowed me to go to India. Um when after I got there a few times I realized I really don't want to be here. But when I look back over time and I begin to realize it's not about me, it's about him. &gt;&gt; He is the one that has allowed me to go. &gt;&gt; We have been going there this coming January. It'll be 20 years. And I began to look at that and I figured this is this is something and and I asked the Lord I asked the Lord would you allow me one more time just to go back &gt;&gt; to see what he has allowed me to be a part of. &gt;&gt; So we're going to have a short trip. It only be six weeks and uh the biggest thing is just just the air transportation. Sitting in a tin can at 40,000 ft with 400 other people is just not my idea of fun. But yeah, &gt;&gt; anyway, but but but here again, I I I learned a long time ago, it's not about me. &gt;&gt; It's about me listening to him &gt;&gt; and allowing him to direct my life. We now have 340 messages in the Telugu language. I have God has allowed me to help supply them the means whereby they can go and do the I don't speak Telugu. Um I I tried learning it once and I gave up it. It's the most complicated language in the in the ind in India in anyway but like I say we now have 380 messages which have been translated into the Telugu language. They're all available to everybody in the world on the hub from Cloverdale. But like I say it when I look back I realized it has been an honor &gt;&gt; for him to allow me to go and to be a part of something greater than myself. I learned a long time ago, it's not about me, it's all about him. &gt;&gt; And but I had to learn how to allow him to direct me. &gt;&gt; And uh like I say, we've had we've had different experiences. I could, you know, I I could anyway, no sense going into details, but like I say, it's just been an honor for me to go and I will look forward to make this one last trip. And somebody else has already supplied the means and everything like that. I'm I'm not asking for anything, but like I say, I just To me, it's a memorial 20 years. And I figured, God, you've been gracious. You've kept me alive. You've allowed me to minister your word to these people. And Lord, I just want one more time. I want to go back and I want to see what you have allowed me to be a part of. &gt;&gt; And God is honoring that. God bless you. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I asked brother null I said how old are you? He says 81. Now if you know anything about missionary work and if you know anything about India, India is not a place that you will go for vacation &gt;&gt; and different things and it's rough and he and sister Shirley get on uh those airplanes long distance and if any of you have got his email where he sends you a little brief uh report of where he's at and what he's doing and I you know I flew over and we got into Madros and we did this and and etc etc and you find out all the hardships six weeks six weeks 81 years of age and he said just let me go one more time I it reminds me of that sermon brother Brennham says just once more Lord &gt;&gt; Amen and just go to go do something for the kingdom of God he's not going there for vacation it's rough in fact when you get home that's when you need some rest and recuperation. [laughter] That's true. Amen. And um I want to say thank you to all of you for cards, letters, and your minister appreciation day. God bless you richly. I uh don't feel I deserve that, but God bless you for your efforts. Let's stand together. Let's sing. Let's sing the brother Brandham called it our theme song. And he said, "I've sang that song around the world. Only believe." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thousands of times, the prophet would come out to this song. a vindicated messenger &gt;&gt; with a message upon his heart. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said the angel told him, he said, "As Moses was given two signs, you're going to be given two signs. And if you'll get the people to believe, &gt;&gt; there's something in the heart of every elect seed that has the ability &gt;&gt; to hear what that messenger is saying. &gt;&gt; You are actually a recipient. &gt;&gt; You are able to hear &gt;&gt; what others cannot. They have ears to hear, but they hear not. They have eyes to see, &gt;&gt; but they see not. But blessed are your ears, and blessed are your eyes. &gt;&gt; And as we sing this song, let's just take a moment and thank God for what he's done &gt;&gt; in this our generation. And most of all, not only for what he's done, but what he's doing. &gt;&gt; And that we're a part of it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Holy [singing] be, &gt;&gt; only be all [singing] things are possible. &gt;&gt; Only [chant] believe. Only [singing] believe. &gt;&gt; Only believe. [singing] All things are [singing] possible. &gt;&gt; Only believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's just remain standing. Thank you, musicians. Amen. Let's turn in your Bibles please to Matthew 12 28- 29. Then we'll [snorts] go to Revelation 2. Now I want to say this as we begin the service. There are times in which you as a minister are deeply moved upon, profoundly moved. And I want to say this is one of the times. Uh this may be a pastoral declaration, a personal declaration of what I have become a witness to see and to hear within this message. And uh so I I would like all of your undivided attention this morning to listen and listen carefully. I want to measure every word. I want God to speak to every heart. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to just be a spectator. &gt;&gt; I want you to get in the game. &gt;&gt; If I use that terminology, I don't want you to just sit here and watch. &gt;&gt; I want you to get into it. &gt;&gt; This message is not for you to just repeat like a parrot. &gt;&gt; Amen. and say it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But to actually let the message come into your being &gt;&gt; because the message, brother Brennham said, is Christ. &gt;&gt; And when Christ comes in &gt;&gt; when he comes in, [snorts] &gt;&gt; he does something for you. &gt;&gt; And he begins to reveal himself. Brother Brennham said, "One of the three-fold purpose of God is that he might reveal himself to his people." &gt;&gt; Hebrews 12 verses 28 and 29. [snorts] Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace by we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire. &gt;&gt; For our God is a consuming fire. Turn with me to the book of Revelation, chapter 2, verses 1-7. Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus, write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks. I know thy works and thy labor, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear with them which are evil. Thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars, and hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast labored, and hast not fainted. Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember, therefore, from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. But this thou hast, which thou hatest the deeds of the nicicoatans, which I also hate. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. And [snorts] to him that overcomemeth while I grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God. Amen. May God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated this morning in [snorts] the presence of the Lord. I would like to continue on with my thought this morning of from form unto fire. This is part two. I will have another part of this that I probably will preach on this coming Sunday. Now, I was supposed to leave on Thursday to go to uh to go to Florida to preach for brother Keith Brown. And due to all the complications with the government shutdown and planes cancelling and all of this stuff, it's becomes, you know, so uh hectic that I just called brother Brown this morning and I told him I said, "Brother Brown, I if you don't mind, I don't feel that it's conducive to try to travel this weekend. Even if we got there, we may not get home. I mean, everything's shutting down. &gt;&gt; Oh, you know, it's actually Brother Bram's fault. I blame him because he said the whole world's falling apart. And when a prophet speaks something, it just comes to pass. It's all falling apart. America is coming uh uh, you know, it's coming apart at the seams. And just about the time you think that the left has gotten so far left, they can't get any more left, then there's a another left movement that gets even worse. And you see what's happening with New York City and you uh different things. Well, hey, don't don't Hey, listen. Uh I'm glad that God's got everything under control. &gt;&gt; These things have got to come to pass. So, we're not worried about it. We're not going to uh fuss over it. We're not preaching politics because we're not politicians. We're Christians. &gt;&gt; We love God with all our heart. Amen. So, I would like to take the subject this morning of refueling the fire. &gt;&gt; And I'll continue on with this thought. Now, in order to give you a little bit of a background of how the Lord has been dealing with me even in the last couple weeks, um the wife and I and having our morning devotions, um and we're reading, we were reading uh from our Bibles first and then go to the seven church age book and we read, she reads a paragraph, I read a paragraph and so on. And in reading um in the Ephesian church age, I was overcome. I I I I came to actually became so distraught of seeing what was happening to the Ephesian church age &gt;&gt; that I I I began to weep. Brother Bram said, "Watch." He says here in the very Ephesian church age, the church, the first church age, the one that saw Pentecost, &gt;&gt; the one that had the disciples preaching, the one that had the great move of God and within uh a span of about 50 years already, wolves in sheep's clothing, false prophets, false teachers, Himenias and Phileitas have come in and said the resurrection's already passed and all kinds and made shipwreck of of different believers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then as we begin to go through this and and brother Brennham says that God had a complaint there with Ephesus because thou was left your first love. Imagine &gt;&gt; the very first church age that saw all of this, the great supernatural. &gt;&gt; Yes. And yet Ephesus means relaxed. They just began to get a little relaxed. &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, my brother, my sister, and we get a little relaxed in the comforts of Laia and the pressures and this and that and your job and your family and this and that. And what it does, it has an effect upon you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you're not careful, you've got to refuel the fire because a fire consumes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it'll go out if you don't refuel it. &gt;&gt; So it's not just one baptism of the Holy Ghost. Brother Bram said, baptism after baptism, &gt;&gt; but line upon line, precept upon precept. &gt;&gt; God dealing with you. He started the work in you and he will finish that work in you. &gt;&gt; Now to just give you and I'm going to read this quote over again and then I'm going to read from the seven church age book uh for just a moment if you all don't mind to give you a little bit of a background of what I began to see within the church age book. Brother Brenham said uh in the Ephesian church age that cycle of revival and death has never failed. &gt;&gt; So now brother Brenham said I'm a typologist. I look and I see what happened. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; As it was &gt;&gt; shall it. &gt;&gt; So shall it be. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; If you want to know what will be look what has been. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So he says the cycle of revival and death has never failed. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is recall this move of God in the spirit when men and women dressed like Christians, went to church, prayed all night, took to the street corners, and weren't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit. They left their old dead churches and worshiped in homes and old store buildings. and they had reality. But it wasn't too long a time until they began to get enough money to build find new churches. &gt;&gt; They put in a a choir instead of singing unto God for themselves. &gt;&gt; And may I say this as a pastor, I don't want all of you to watch the song leader lead songs. And I don't want you to sit there and not get involved. Come on. &gt;&gt; Now, if you want to see whether or not you're involved, go look at our archive and see if you're sitting or clapping or even opening your mouth. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Take that as a rebuke if you wish. But I I want all of you I don't want uh just you sitting there like this and you're observing. I want you to get into it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's good, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to get into it. I want you, IF YOU'RE SINGING ABOUT GOD, I WANT YOU TO SING. I WANT YOU TO GET YOUR VOICE BEHIND IT. &gt;&gt; I want you to get involved. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not doing this for man. You're doing it FOR GOD. AND IF ANY OF YOU, &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. SOMEBODY SAY, "AMEN." THAT'S TRUE. YOU'RE NOT DOING IT for man. I'm doing it for him. &gt;&gt; IF I'M GOING TO BE A FOOL, LET ME BE A FOOL FOR CHRIST. &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. They got gowns on the choir and they organized a movement and ran it by man. [snorts] They soon began to read books that weren't fit to read. They went down to the bars and goats, excuse me, they let down the bars and goats came in and took over. The cry of joy was gone. &gt;&gt; The freedom of the spirit was gone. &gt;&gt; Oh, they kept on with the form. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So now they they kept on with a form and I started with from fire to form. &gt;&gt; Now I don't want to leave you on a negative. &gt;&gt; But I want to go from form unto fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. They kept on with a form, but the fire had died down and the blackness of ashes is about all that is left. &gt;&gt; Now, I must admit that this issue of the cycle of revival and death has never failed is an issue that is of grave concern for me, not only as a pastor, but as an elder within the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; It only takes a simple glance as a minister to visit churches and you begin to see formalism. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You begin to see uh religious ways. &gt;&gt; You begin to see that that we if we're not too careful, we become regimented. &gt;&gt; We sing so many song specials and and this and that. We change the order of the service and people are not pulling. They're they're not seeking God. Oh, my brother, my sister, there's nothing &gt;&gt; as a minister that I enjoy better &gt;&gt; that I desire more. And that is when you're praying at home &gt;&gt; and when you're seeking God in your prayer closet and there in my home, God begins to just take my mind &gt;&gt; and permeate IT FULL OF YOUR REQUESTS of your needs and the things that are on your heart AND GOD BEGINS TO ACTIVATE THAT GIFT. BECAUSE BROTHER RAM SAID, "NO MATTER HOW MUCH I HAVE THE ANOINTING AND HAVE A WORD ON my heart, IF YOU'RE NOT PULLING," HE SAID, "THE words fall in front of the pulpit." &gt;&gt; I SAY, "MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, I NEED YOUR HELP. &gt;&gt; I CANNOT DO it alone. Hey, &gt;&gt; this effect of revival and death &gt;&gt; is not only happening locally &gt;&gt; but globally. &gt;&gt; It has become viral. And I wish to empty my heart this morning as a pastor &gt;&gt; and as a minister of this gospel that concerns me. &gt;&gt; And I want you to bear with me this morning if you would please. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this issue is something that has not just started in the last couple weeks. In fact, it was just after I had come into the message and I'd only been in it a few months and I already saw within the little group that I came into the message with how the divisions and interpretations. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and opinions &gt;&gt; uh came in and how the different ones wanted to rise up and and control the group or or to say which way we were going to go and that sort of thing. And we were just listening to tapes. We didn't have a minister. We were just listening to tapes. And listening to tapes is wonderful. Praise God for that. But there must be a five-fold ministry that says to get into this. &gt;&gt; God has ordained them to go into this message &gt;&gt; and then feed it to your people. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says, and I just reiterate to you, all of those who go out do not uh have the revelation or the understanding to say only what that prophet messenger has said. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he said they begin to add their interpretation, their opinion, their own ideas uh to the message and it longer is pure and it becomes hybrid. And when you hybrid something, it cannot reproduce itself to the original. That's why I say stay with that original. &gt;&gt; SAY WHAT THAT PROPHET SAID. STAY WITH THE BIBLE. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. that is our absolute. &gt;&gt; But when the ministry becomes uh compromising and relaxed and no longer preaches against sin, &gt;&gt; it has a trickle down effect &gt;&gt; to the congregation &gt;&gt; because if the ministry compromises the congregation will also. Amen. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; now I told the brethren that I'm going to read from the seven church age book. I gave them they went ahead and took a photo copy of it. I said I didn't cut and paste and send it to them. So I don't know if they can follow me. Uh that's fine if they don't. Now this happens to be the seven church age book that George Smith had uh printed and its pages and paragraphing is different than the seven church age book from uh voice of God and he did that purposely so he could print it and they could not stop him because they said we have a copyright on that. So he changed the format. So but the wording is the same. So, I told the brethren, if you don't mind, and I'll just use some of these reading glasses here to be able to read it properly and not guess at the wording. Okay, brother Brennham says here, to understand this, you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original saints of Ephesus alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do do we have it up here? Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. So, just follow along with me. And if I make an error, just you pray for me because I'm over 70 and sometimes it just doesn't. This message is to the entire age which lasted about 120 years. Its message re uh its message then is to all the generations in that span. Now history keeps repeating itself. &gt;&gt; In the generations of Israel, we see revival in one generation only to the sea the fires fading in the next. In the third generation, embers may be glowing slightly, but in the fourth there may be no vestage whatsoever of that original flame. Oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I began to read this and I said, and even as my wife and I were reading this, I said, "Oh God, I said, "Look at this." He's showing history repeating itself. &gt;&gt; Now, please again, bear with me as as I as I tell you what concerns me. &gt;&gt; Then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated. It is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Salvation is not passed on by natural birth. &gt;&gt; No, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Any more than there's any truth to apostolic succession. It isn't in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Understand that you may be born to born again Christian family members. Your mom and dad may have salvation. And because you were born in that family does not mean you got salvation. YOU MUST COME THE SAME way they came. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He that hath THE SON HATH LIFE. HE THAT HATH NOT THE SON HATH NOT LIFE. &gt;&gt; EVERY MAN MUST BE BORN AGAIN. THEY MUST WORK OUT YOUR OWN SALVATION WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING. IT DOESN'T COME TO YOU JUST BECAUSE YOUR parents are believers. YOU, I ASK YOU, DO YOU BELIEVE? &gt;&gt; Good question. &gt;&gt; You start out with truly born again believers and when the next generation comes along, they no longer just plain Christians, but they have taken a denominational name and are now Baptists and Methodists, etc. That's exactly what they are, too. They are not Christians. You have to be born of the will of God, not the will of man to be saved. But these folks are all coming together now by the will of man. I don't say that some of them aren't right with God. Not for a minute do I say that. But the original fire has died down. They are not the same anymore. The fervent desire to please God, the passion to know his word for the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God, it has cooled off and it become a bit formal. And I began to as we were reading this, I began to feel it. &gt;&gt; I'm not just reading this, but it's having an effect. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Cooling off and becoming a bit formal. That is what's happening back there in the Ephesians. They were getting a bit formal. The abandonment to God was dying out. And the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they began to to be careful about what the world thought of them. &gt;&gt; Who cares what the world thinks? &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PLEASE THE WORLD, YOU CANNOT PLEASE GOD. TO BE CARNALLY MINDED IS ENMITY WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; To follow CHRIST IS TO DIE to self. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, people will hate you &gt;&gt; for being a Christian. &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid of taking sides with Jesus. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I don't care. You know, you see all of the headlines of these movie stars and actors and rock and roll people and they say, "Well, about this and about that." Who cares? &gt;&gt; They're nothing but a bunch of actors. &gt;&gt; They're a bunch of heathens, a bunch of Jezebels. &gt;&gt; That's plain. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If if you're going to hear about the age, listen to what THE PROPHET OF GOD had to say. Because the spirit WAS USING HIM. HE WAS THE MESSENGER &gt;&gt; THAT GOD WAS USING TO TELL THIS THIS GENERATION, &gt;&gt; GET RIGHT WITH GOD. GET BACK TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That second generation coming on was just like Israel. They demanded a king to be like the other nations. &gt;&gt; When when they did that, THEY REJECTED GOD. BUT THEY did it anyway. &gt;&gt; That is history of the church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God, it isn't long until you see them stop doing things they used to do, start doing things they wouldn't do initially. They change their manner of dress. Watch the three examples. They change their manner of dress, their attitude, and their behavior. &gt;&gt; They get laxed. That is what Ephesus means. relaxed, drifting, &gt;&gt; they change their manner of dress, &gt;&gt; their attitude and their behavior. &gt;&gt; I, as a pastor, see it. &gt;&gt; I see the dress when it begins to no longer have a way of holiness about it. But you see the the ways of the world and worldly dress. And brother Brennham says, "Watch the women because they're an indication of the church." &gt;&gt; Not that you're attacking the women. Sisters, understand this, &gt;&gt; but he says, "When I look at the woman, I'm looking at the man whom she reflects. And when I see formalism and I see more uh care about women wanting to be more fashionable and high heel shoes and and uh low neck uh dresses and slinky uh wiener SKIN DOWN TYPE DRESS. I DON'T CARE if it's long. &gt;&gt; IF YOU WERE POURED INTO IT, SOMETHING'S WRONG. &gt;&gt; THERE SHOULD be a holiness. &gt;&gt; Preach, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; That cycle of revival and death has never failed. I'm going to bypass that and go to paragraph 91. A few moments ago, I mentioned that John understood what it was to love God. That great apostle of love would certainly see it when the church began to lose that first love of God. He quotes then from 1 John 5:3. For this is the love of God that we keep his commandments, his word. &gt;&gt; One little deviation from that word has to step away from Christ. &gt;&gt; People say they love God. They go to church. They even shout and rejoice and sing and have a great emotional time. &gt;&gt; But when it's all over, watch and see if they are in that word, &gt;&gt; walking in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Living in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. If they go through all the other and don't walk in that word, they can say they love God, but their lives &gt;&gt; tell another story. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, what does your life tell me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good question. &gt;&gt; What does your life tell me? &gt;&gt; What is your Facebook, your Instagram? &gt;&gt; Who do you befriend? You got more friends of the world than you do within the church. I say something's wrong &gt;&gt; again. I told you it's going to be a pastoral message. &gt;&gt; I wonder if John didn't see of that before he died. People saying they love God but not obeying his word. Oh, Ephesian church, something is happening to you. Someone's trying to either add to that word or take away from it, but they're doing it so subtly they can't see it. They haven't made a move so big you can see it there in the open. It's undercover and they are bringing it in a way of reason and human understanding and we'll take over unless you refuse it. go back to pick Pentecost before it's too late. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now, let me reiterate again that this is not something that just all of a sudden I got this epiphany a week or two ago. I became aware of this when I was 18 years old, just months within the message. And when I began to see men adding to and taking away from the message, I was zealous for it then, and I'm zealous for it now. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I began to see the side effects &gt;&gt; in German. &gt;&gt; When you take a prescription, it has side effects. &gt;&gt; What's amazing is you need XYZ to take care of your arthritis. But if you have heart problems, if you have diarrhea, if you have this and that, if you have low blood sugar and do not take it &gt;&gt; because the effects of it may be worse than what you're trying, &gt;&gt; okay, help me. Help me, Lord. &gt;&gt; So this awareness of the effects of lowering standards and compromising on the word of God is consuming me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it overwhelms me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think I'm done. I quit. It's not that I have left the love of God or &gt;&gt; I want to go into the world. No, I would say, okay, hey, I believe this message and I got no problem with it. It's I got problems with you guys. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; And I I'm going to share something very deeply with you. When I see these effects, I see it not only within the local church, but within our own personal lives. I want to I want to reach to where you're living. I want to come to your address. &gt;&gt; This letter has got your name on it. &gt;&gt; Part of the curse of Ladya is easy living. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have need of nothing. &gt;&gt; It's too easy to become lax, slackful, no longer fervent for something. And actually, brother null, you're 81 years of age. Why haven't you slowed down? And instead of six weeks in India, why don't you make it six days? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Go ahead. Because hey, I'll tell you what, follow his schedule and see what he preaches. &gt;&gt; My goodness. What I'm saying is a lot of times I as a minister, I say, Lord, even how hard I preach and how much I try to make the people understand. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; I see people getting laxed. I see I see the ways of the world coming in &gt;&gt; and honestly I take it personal &gt;&gt; when I begin to see the church become cold and formal and not pulling. I take it personal. &gt;&gt; HOW ELSE can I take it? Come on. &gt;&gt; But in my consecration, in my prayer closet before God, God came and gave me some soloulless to my heart and said, "You cannot make the foolish wise." &gt;&gt; Don't take it personal. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Did not SAMUEL SAY, "THEY'VE REJECTED ME." And God had to come telling me, &gt;&gt; Samuel, it's not you they rejected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's me they rejected. &gt;&gt; Give them a king. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; And especially as I get older, I become a little bit battleweary. &gt;&gt; Why fight, &gt;&gt; man? Let's go on R&R. &gt;&gt; You understand? Amen. &gt;&gt; But the flashing red lights of the warnings that I saw years ago has now become blaring sirens of warning like a tsunami that's coming and and there's a tsunami warning and it gets louder and it's continuous. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are any of you aware of all of the flashing red lights and the signs of warning? &gt;&gt; OH, I PRAY THAT THE FERANCY THAT YOU HAVE FOR GOD IS NOT BECOMING LAX, &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE REFUELING THE FIREMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T ALLOW YOURSELF TO BECOME COMPLACENT. &gt;&gt; GET IN THE GAME. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS YOUR MESSAGE. THIS MESSAGE WAS ORDAINED TO BRING YOU BACK TO WHERE YOU BEGAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE &gt;&gt; IS YOUR DESTINY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Thank you, Lord. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord. as a military general trains his troops to go to war. And he he's got to put them through the time of going through boot camp and training and rough and crawl on the ground and live ammunition. HE'S GOT TO TRY TO simulate war &gt;&gt; because he tells them war is hell. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Some of you ain't coming back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when he leads his men into battle, they have casualties. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And every general when he sees the casualties of the men whom he's led, who he he knew who were comrade in arms. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he see him carried out on a stretcher. HOW CAN HE NOT FEEL INVOLVED? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; I SAW A DOCUMENTARY the other day. Excuse me. To just make a little detour a moment [snorts] &gt;&gt; because we see the anti-semitism coming up now in this age against the Jews &gt;&gt; and against Christians. What's happening in Nigeria, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; and the different countries around the world are only little warnings. &gt;&gt; Warnings. How did the Holocaust happen? How did 6 million Jews I've been in &gt;&gt; Ashvitz? &gt;&gt; The name of the city in Polish is &gt;&gt; Oensham, but the but the Germans changed it to Ashvitz. &gt;&gt; I've been there. I've seen the crematoriums. &gt;&gt; I've been there. HOW COULD THIS HOLOCAUST TAKE PLACE JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE JEWS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE THEY DID SOMETHING WRONG. NOT BECAUSE THEY were murderers and liars, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They were Jews. &gt;&gt; That spirit's rising up again. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It is. And I happened to see a a small clip of of Liam Niss was in a movie called Schindler's List and they were asking the man who was the producer and excuse me I don't remember their names [snorts] but they said that the just the remaking of it to make it similar &gt;&gt; to what they went through the people that were doing the filming, the actors and everything began to have nervous breakdowns, &gt;&gt; began to have mental problems because COULD THIS REALLY HAPPENED? &gt;&gt; COME ON. YEAH. &gt;&gt; ALL THEY WERE DOING IS REENACTING, &gt;&gt; MAKING IT look like what really happened. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And there was one part of the documentary that was amazing because and this was not scripted. This was off script. Liam Nissan, who was Schindler, who was trying to save as many Jews as he could and the children, and he his wealth he he poured into all kinds of schemes and things to be able to to get them and PROTECT THEM AND SAVE as many as he could. And when he kind of come to the end of his money and the end of his ability, Liam Niss had a breakdown on the set off script and he became Schindler in spirit and he said, "Oh, if I WOULD HAVE SOLD SOLD MY CAR. IF I WOULD HAVE SOLD A FEW MORE THINGS, I WOULD HAVE GOT ONE MORE. &gt;&gt; I WOULD HAVE SAVED just one more. &gt;&gt; And did they cut it out of the film? No. They said that's what made the film. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OFF SCRIPT, HE JUST BEGAN to say, "IF I COULD HAVE DONE [screaming] SOMETHING &gt;&gt; TO SAVE ONE MORE, My &gt;&gt; you see when you begin to lose good men and you [snorts] see the casualties happening within the church when families leave the message. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; As a minister I carry woundings. &gt;&gt; I take it personal. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I didn't preach hard enough. I didn't preach good enough. I didn't preach it simple enough. Why did they leave? &gt;&gt; It's my fault. &gt;&gt; Oh, if I could have done better. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If I'd have been a better pastor if we'd had more services. &gt;&gt; Maybe we ought to go to three services on Sunday instead of just one. &gt;&gt; Do you Do you see what I'm saying? There's things that I I take it I take it personally because the loss of every man or woman or child or family that a pastor loses, you take it personal. How could a general not take it? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; These were good men. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think of Moses in the first Exodus. No matter how vindicated he was of God, he had Dayan and Cora rise up against him. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; And he WENT BEFORE GOD. WHY HAVE YOU SENT ME? &gt;&gt; Take my life. Don't bring them to judgment. He stood in the gap. Was he not feeling &gt;&gt; for the people? And then he took it personal &gt;&gt; just as Joshua when they started losing battles, he took it PERSONAL AND HE FELL ON HIS FACE BEFORE GOD. He wept over the loss of men. The Apostle Paul did the same thing. He began to say, "All men have forsaken me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm not shun to declare unto them the whole council of God. &gt;&gt; But doors are closing to me just as the prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; One time he lost the feeling for the people. What What good is it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All the sermons I've preached. Everything I've said, all of the sleepless nights, all of the flying in an aluminum tube at 40,000 ft. Huh? &gt;&gt; It's not vacation. [snorts] &gt;&gt; The very ones that sponsored and supported him and his early ministry now denied him, &gt;&gt; rejected him, &gt;&gt; took their support away, and they closed every door. And there was just a handful of believers around the world that recognized there was something special about his ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Went from hundreds of thousands down to just handfuls. &gt;&gt; No wonder Brother Brennham had to be transported beyond the curtain of time. &gt;&gt; What what what good is my ministry? all of this and all the preaching and all of the prayer lines and all of the things that I've done. &gt;&gt; Oh my, where are they? &gt;&gt; God said, "Hey, Elijah, can I take you beyond the curtain of time for a moment?" &gt;&gt; He said, "I want to show you. You want to see the effects of your ministry?" Yes. &gt;&gt; He He said, "These are all yours." He said, "Are they Branoms?" He said, "No, &gt;&gt; no, they're not Branoms." &gt;&gt; He said, "Those are your converts." &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you, how many of you say, "I'm a convert of Malachi 4." &gt;&gt; Then who did he see? &gt;&gt; Come on, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; HE SAW YOU BEFORE YOU WERE BORN. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAW YOU BEFORE YOU CAME INTO THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; He saw you WHEN YOU WERE STILL A RE RICKY OR A &gt;&gt; REQUETTA. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHY GOD HAD TO HAVE THE PROPHET to quit saying Ricky and Retta AND GET SO WHY? BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THEM. &gt;&gt; ME TOO, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU EVER GET SO SELF-RIGHTEOUS THAT YOU LOOK DOWN YOUR NOSE AT SOMEONE ELSE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Look at that. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm not like that. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU'D BE WORSE THAN THAT &gt;&gt; IF GOD WOULD HAVE LET YOU KEEP GOING. BUT GOD, WHO IS RICH IN MERCY, GOT A HOLD OF YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. THANK GOD HE GOT A HOLD OF YOU. THANK GOD YOU HEARD THAT VOICE. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, let me share something with you that I began to see a comparison in this age [snorts] because every true God-given leadership stands in the gap for the people. Yes, &gt;&gt; that's why I covet your prayers. &gt;&gt; God, give us more Aaron and hers that lift up the hands of Moses. &gt;&gt; You understand the biblical principle. I preached a sermon years ago, hands up, hands on, and hands under. Every one of you have got a ministry. MAYBE YOUR MINISTRY IS ONLY TO PRAY FOR YOUR PASTOR. PRAY FOR THE MINISTRY. GOD, RAISE HIM UP. DON'T LET HIM BECAUSE HE'S THE OX OF THE TEAM. BUT IF THE OX of the team IS SO OVERBURDENED, &gt;&gt; IF A NATURAL OX &gt;&gt; PUT IN THE YOKE &gt;&gt; AND HE PULLS AND HE STRAINS, &gt;&gt; until he until he falls under the weight, &gt;&gt; he'll never pull the same again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It happened to Elijah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brother Bram said he had a nervous breakdown. Elijah, &gt;&gt; God's one man Rambo. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had a nervous breakdown. &gt;&gt; You know what God said? There's only a couple things that God had Elijah do. I I want you to go pray for a little couple over here because you know what he did? He went off into the desert and said, "Oh, God would take my life, what good has it done, oh God." And I love one of the most amazing quotes that Brother Rem said here. Elijah, he's having a nervous breakdown. He doesn't want to preach no more. He doesn't want to go nowhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said that God searched through all of heaven &gt;&gt; and found the angel that had the softest palm. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he had him brush the brow &gt;&gt; of Elijah. &gt;&gt; All he did was feed him &gt;&gt; and give him orn for a few times. &gt;&gt; After that, you go look at his ministry. He only does a couple more things. &gt;&gt; Great ministries overburdened. &gt;&gt; Have breakdowns. &gt;&gt; I don't want to have a breakdown. I want to have a breakthrough. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I I I began to see that remember the first time that Joshua taking the children of Israel across Jordan, the first battle they have is the battle of Jericho. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And there was Rahab. She receives the two messengers. And I'm not going to go into Rahab. That's a whole another sermon. But after Jericho, there is another battle that they think, "Oh, we don't need to send so many men." So in Joshua 7, I want you to follow along. They gave this to the brethren. So we'll read this in Joshua 7. This is right after Jericho. But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the thing. For Achen the son of Cari, the son of Zebdi, the son of Zarah, of the tribe of Judah, took up the thing, and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai. &gt;&gt; You want to know the problem we got today? &gt;&gt; Ai, follow along. [laughter] uh which is beside Beth even on the east side of Betham, spake to them, saying, "Go up and view the country." And the men went up and viewed Ai. They took a look at it. Not so bad. They returned to Joshua and said, "Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai, and make not all the people to labor thither, for they are but a few." what may look like a few, what may look like something's innocent, &gt;&gt; right? Come on, &gt;&gt; watch the effects. So there went up about thither of the people about 3,000 men, and they fled before the men of Ai. &gt;&gt; And the men of Ai smoked them about 30 and six men. For they chased them from before the gate, even unto she baron, and smote them in the going down. Therefore the hearts of the people melted and became as water. And Joshua rented Did Did he take it personal? &gt;&gt; He took it so personal he rent his clothes &gt;&gt; and fell on the earth upon his face before the ark of the Lord until even time. And the elders of Israel put dust on their heads. And Joshua said, "Alas, oh Lord God, there wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us? Would to God we had been content and dwelt ON THE OTHER SIDE OF JORDAN." &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, WHAT SHALL I SAY WHEN ISRAEL TURNETH their backs before their enemies? HE TOOK IT PERSONAL. &gt;&gt; I take it personal. Oh God, WHAT DO I SAY? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHEN PEOPLE WITHIN THE MESSAGE TURN THEIR BACKS ON GOD AND FACE THEIR ENEMY AND HAVE UNION WITH THEM. &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; For the Canaanites and the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall envir us around, and cut off our name our name from the earth, and what will thou do unto thy great name? And the Lord said unto Joshua, "Get thee up. Wherefore liest thou upon thy face. Quit crying, Josh. &gt;&gt; Israel has sinned." &gt;&gt; And they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. For they have even taken of the oursed thing and have also stolen and disassembled also. And they have put it even among their own stuff. &gt;&gt; Look at that. Come on. &gt;&gt; My home is my castle. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I want you to I want you to know that what you preach in church, I don't have to do it at home. &gt;&gt; Cuz what I do is my problem. &gt;&gt; It's me personally. I don't have to adhere to the laws you're saying. You tell me to do this with my kids and this and that. I I don't need to do it. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; We're in a time of another battle of AI right now. &gt;&gt; We are fighting the battle of artificial intelligence. &gt;&gt; AI is not godly intelligence. &gt;&gt; It's not divine intelligence. &gt;&gt; It's not having the mind of Christ. It comes from the tree of knowledge. And I'm going to tell you that AI is infiltrating itself in EVERY FACET OF OUR SOCIETY. EVERYTHING around you from your home TO YOUR SCHOOL TO YOUR GOVERNMENT TO YOUR CHURCHES to the ministry. &gt;&gt; Everything is affected by AI. &gt;&gt; What is it from? Tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Call it Siri. Call it Google. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Did you know that they're they're telling you your phone is listening to you? &gt;&gt; Your iPad? &gt;&gt; Your watch? &gt;&gt; I got a smartwatch. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I do. When it's wet, I know it's raining. Oh, you know, I don't mean to make a a joke out of this. Everything in this society, Brother Bram said, has come from the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And when the tree of knowledge, every bite that is taken away from taken off of the tree of knowledge brings forth death and destruction. You think it's just okay to let your children play with AI and to have their iPads and their cell phones. I bear you witness now. We see it in the world, but I see it coming into the church. &gt;&gt; And I see you allowing your children, your little ones, to have a cell phone and sit there like this. And their eyes are going to be real bad because you know what? They're they're this how far they look. Then you wonder why you're going to have problems with your kids. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If China is passing a law that no one under 18 can have a cell phone, &gt;&gt; China Yeah, I'm just letting this sink in. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that that old man, that pastor, he &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I think you just done cross the line. &gt;&gt; You're a little too critical. &gt;&gt; Why don't you back up, buddy? Why don't you Why don't you just ease off a little bit? I can't. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not a quitter. &gt;&gt; I never have been. &gt;&gt; And when the going gets tough, &gt;&gt; that's when the tough get going. &gt;&gt; Huh? Let me tell you, this is goal line defense. &gt;&gt; This is it. The game's gone into overtime. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They asked some of those guys in the Super Bowl. They said, "What is the most glorious time of the Super Bowl? Is it when you come through the the door into the stadium, the crowd's yelling and they're blowing their horns and everything?" He said, "What is the most glorious time for you in with your team?" He said, "It's when we're in the huddle and the game's gone into overtime." And he says, "My men, come back to the huddle. [panting] They're breathing hard. They've got color on their helmets. Their clothes is dirtied. Their knuckles are bloodied." And the captain of the team says, "Okay, guys, here's the play. I want every man to do your job." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Tackles and guards and ends and running backs and all of you do YOUR JOB. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE SAY ONTO HEIGHT, HE SAID WHEN WE SNAP THE BALL, I WANT YOU TO GET INTO YOUR POSITION AND DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. HE SAID THAT RUNNING BACK CANNOT RUN UNLESS YOU MAKE THE HOLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. The byproduct of AI is death and destruction because they're eating from the tree of knowledge. Side effects are all around us in every facet OF OUR SOCIETY. DON'T YOU KNOW THAT A LITTLE levan leavenvens the whole lump? &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Amen. Poison been added to the pot. Side effects or death and destruction. When Elisha discovered somebody had put some wild gourds and wild vines into the message. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; THEY STARTED GETTING SICK. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; They started HAVING EFFECTS. THERE'S DEATH IN THE POT. &gt;&gt; YEAH. Elisha knew there was only one remedy. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. The meal offering. 2 Kings 4:38 41. Elisha came unto Gilgal and there was dirt in the land which means a drought. The sons of the prophets were sitting before him. Sons of the prophets were started by the sons of Samuel. &gt;&gt; Right? Go read your Bible history. &gt;&gt; Most of the time, the sons of the prophets never followed the ways of their father. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Were sitting before him. And he said unto his servant, "Set on the great pot and seed pottage for the sons of the prophets." And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered therefore wild gourds, his lap full, and came shred them into the pot of the message, for they knew them not. They poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass as they were eating of the pottage that they cried out and said, "Oh, thou man of God, there is death in the pot." And they could not eat thereof. And he said, "Bring meal." And cast it into the pot and said, "Pour out for the people that they may eat." And there was no harm in the pot. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, preachers have gone out and gotten wild vines, &gt;&gt; wild gourds, &gt;&gt; wild ideas, strange fire. &gt;&gt; Huh? They haven't stayed with the original recipe. &gt;&gt; Add a little bit of a wild vine of Peruia. &gt;&gt; Add a little bit of two souls doctrine. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; Throw in a pinch of wild seven thunders. &gt;&gt; Mix in some deed doctrine and THOROUGHLY MIX IT. THROW IN ALL KINDS OF isms &gt;&gt; and the MESSAGE NO LONGER IS PURE AND REVIVAL DIES DOWN &gt;&gt; AND YOU'LL NOT BRING FORTH AN original seed. &gt;&gt; I'm [snorts] shaking right now. &gt;&gt; I'm shaking. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because I take this personally. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. No wonder there's a need now among message conventions to have prayer lines &gt;&gt; because the message has been added TO SO MUCH BY ALL THESE WILD vines and wild gourds that the people are sick. &gt;&gt; THEY GOT ALL KINDS OF COMPLEXES AND AND SPIRITS and oh I NEED TO BE FREE AND EVERYTHING. BUT YOU DON'T HEAR THE PREACHER SAYING REPENT. GET BACK TO GOD. [screaming] YOU'VE BEEN OUT HERE PLAYING IN THE WORLD. YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE MOVIES. YOU'VE BEEN MEGA DOSING ON THE WRONG THING. GET BACK TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No more. No longer repent. &gt;&gt; It's accepted. And oh, I tell you, I'll show you. I'm I'm a preacher. I tell you what, I got deliverance ministry. I'm like the seven sons ofKeva &gt;&gt; out here. I tell you, I'll lay hands on you. Brother Bram said, "Be careful who you lay your hands on." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Some sicknesses God allowed." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "You go to casting that spirit off him." Huh? Jesus told him, he said, "Go and sin no more." &gt;&gt; Lest the what? &gt;&gt; Worse thing. &gt;&gt; That's what's happening. &gt;&gt; Cast the spirit off. Oh yes, I'm free. I'm free. Two weeks later, they're worse than they were before. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they go right back. &gt;&gt; I told you I'm in a pastoral preacher. Now, Brother Brennham uses the terminology. He uses it nine times from 40, excuse me, from 1954 to 1964. He said, "The sickest body that I know of is the body of Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna give you a quote, but he says it nine times. Go back and read your message. He said, "The sickest body." So, I'm going to give you one of the quotes, one of nine. Sir, we would see Jesus in Saskatoon. Any of you ever been to Saskatoon? He says, "Now, we'll try to let you out as early as possible. Pray for the sick and ask the sinners to accept Christ." That's the object of being here. &gt;&gt; We do not represent any certain church or any certain denomination. We're just your brethren. We work for all the churches of the living God. And I believe that there is a need of healing tonight more than physical healing. &gt;&gt; I believe it's a spiritual healing. For the sickest body I know of, the body of Jesus Christ is the sickest body I know of. That's a big statement. &gt;&gt; Watch. He shows you the symptoms. &gt;&gt; It's so broke up. So many different denominations and factions. &gt;&gt; And so we're trying to do our best by the gospel to heal that broken body that all the people might come together with one great unity. I don't mean you have to leave your church or uh or make a one organization. Stay in your organizations. That doesn't hurt anything. But be brothers while you're in your organization. I was a Baptist as you know of and I'm still a Baptist. I'm a Pentecostal Baptist now since I received the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenam said, "I'm a Baptist as long as you stay with the word. I'm a Pentecostal as long He says I'm a bent Pentecostal Baptist Lutheran Methodist." You ever seen him? &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; YouTube is full of all kinds of preachers adding their own wild ideas to the message. And when you click on one, you'll get another. And you click on that one, you'll get another. In fact, it's never ending. &gt;&gt; And they're all trying to procelite you. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, a minister that procelites from other pastors &gt;&gt; is a dying preacher. &gt;&gt; Huh? When a minister puts down other ministers &gt;&gt; to lift his own ministry up is a dying or a drowning preacher. &gt;&gt; Right? You ever tried to help somebody when they're drowning? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I have. &gt;&gt; I've had the opportunity. I've saved seven people from drowning in my lifetime. &gt;&gt; And when you see a panicked person and they're drowning, &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; and their eyes are wild. If they get a hold of you, &gt;&gt; Amen. If you take water safety instruction and you learn how to save somebody, but I'll tell you what, I'm not going to make myself look like a hero, like I went out there and I swam up there to him and I went underneath him, caught him from behind and I took him and No, no. You know what I did? I had a surfboard paddle out there with my surfboard and I pushed the surfboard to him. I didn't get near him. Put the surfboard. &gt;&gt; Brother Jim, I let them climb up on top of the surfboard. [laughter] You okay? Yeah. You okay? I'm going to take you in. I paddled them in. You know what's the amazing thing? Out of all the people that I've ever saved from drowning, not one said thank you. &gt;&gt; Wow. [laughter] The family come over to They had their beach towels and they gathered everything [laughter] and they walked off crying. Yeah, it's okay. &gt;&gt; You're welcome. &gt;&gt; They were [snorts] in such shock. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said in harvest time, he says like the wild gourds, death in the pottage from the school of their theologians, they don't want Jesus the bread of life. They don't want him. They put him out of their church. They've got to do it. I don't care what they do. You say, "You think you're going to change it, Brother Brennan?" No, sir. &gt;&gt; But I'm speaking to the elected. &gt;&gt; I can't change them, but I'm going to talk to the elect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I SAY JUST ENOUGH OUT THERE IN DENOMINATION." HE SAYS, "I CAN'T EVEN use the WORD PREDESTINATION." RIGHT? &gt;&gt; I HAVE TO USE FORNOWLEDGE. &gt;&gt; That's right. He said, "BUT I SAY JUST ENOUGH OF THE WORD THAT IF THEY'RE ELECTED, THEY CATCH IT." &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "JUST ENOUGH." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT HOW MANY TAPES YOU HEAR. IT'S WHAT YOU HEAR FROM THE TAPE YOU DID. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RAM SAID, "LITTLE OLD WASHER WOMAN WITH ONE TAPE &gt;&gt; CAN MAKE IT." WHY? CUZ SHE SAYS AMEN TO WHAT SHE HEARD. IT'S NOT HOW MANY TAPES. It's not having a library. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; It's taking that tape. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And eating. &gt;&gt; Take this word. &gt;&gt; Eat it. &gt;&gt; What good is all of these books if you don't read them? &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; my young people. I'm going to make a challenge to all of you, to my young people. If you don't have a seven seals book and a seven church age book, which are two foundational books, &gt;&gt; yes, sir, &gt;&gt; I will get them for you and I will gift them to you. And I want you to put your name in it, but I don't want you to put it on the shelf &gt;&gt; to just say, "I got a seven churches book. &gt;&gt; I got the seven seals." &gt;&gt; I don't want you to do like a lot of people who around the world, they get these books and they stand there and &gt;&gt; I'm happy. I got a book. I got a Bible. I got, you know, whatever. And it's But &gt;&gt; do you read it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Better for you to have one book and read it. than it is to have a whole a whole library. But I'll say this to all of you. If you don't have it, you let me know. Brother Ron, I need a seven church age book and a seven seals. And I'll I'll go go so far as to say this. If you don't have a Bible, I'll buy you one. I won't get you some cheap little uh uh Bible you get over here at Kmart. I'll get you one that's got a leather binding to it. &gt;&gt; I'll get you a quality Bible. So that's a challenge to all of you guys, &gt;&gt; even to our littleer ones. &gt;&gt; That's your sword. &gt;&gt; It is your sword. &gt;&gt; And every sword, Brother Steve, needs a sheath. &gt;&gt; You see, you see this sword you got? &gt;&gt; Stand up. Turn around and show everybody your sheath. Amen. Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because you don't want to take your Bible. Go ahead and sit down &gt;&gt; and just throw it on the dashboard of your car in the heat of this Arizona sun. Shrivel up the pages. &gt;&gt; Leave it out IN THE RAIN. THROW IT IN THE BACK OF YOUR CAR WITH ALL OF YOUR JUNK. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; With your pickle ball racket &gt;&gt; and your golf clubs. Somebody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the pages get all wrinkled and shriveled up. &gt;&gt; Keep it in shape. &gt;&gt; The way you treat your Bible &gt;&gt; is the way you treat God. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Reverence it. &gt;&gt; Get a cover for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't just leave it anywhere. Just don't throw it off to the side. Never take it. Throw it across the room. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; You reference it. &gt;&gt; You pray over it before you read it. [sighs] &gt;&gt; I told you it's a pastoral. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; Brother Random, you think you're going to change it? Let's go back to this quote. No, sir. But I'm speaking to the elected. &gt;&gt; Watch this. They put him out. They took their pottage, mixed it with the world, some theories of something and mixed it together and made it a theological seminary pottage. And they refused the prophet Elijah's meal to cure it. Did they do it again that in that day? Elijah had some meal. That meal was Christ. the meal offering all ground the same. Every burr had to be the same to grind it and throw it back in there and cured the sickness, their death in the pot. But today they got death in the pot and they don't want Elijah's meal, &gt;&gt; Christ, the bread, the word. No sir, it's heresy. &gt;&gt; DID NOT PAUL SAID, "I SERVE GOD IN THE WAY THAT MEN TODAY CALL HERESY." &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. They won't have it. Go ahead and eat it and you'll die sure as the world. &gt;&gt; There's poison in the pot. They won't accept this meal. No sir. In their theological pots, they just won't do it. Now, they put you out of it. They don't want nothing to do with it. That's a whole sermon within itself. I've often wanted to preach the theological pots within the message. AI has affected our homes, our ministries, our churches, our schools, our government, and our nation. Great and powerful nations. Great and powerful nations. Any of you that know your history, great empires, China, Egypt, Greece, Rome, and now the United States. Great powerful nations. &gt;&gt; Now watch this. Let me Let me take a few more minutes &gt;&gt; because I take this message &gt;&gt; so personal. &gt;&gt; I think some of you haven't really looked at it the way it should be looked at. You can't see the forest for the trees. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In June of 2020, I preached a sermon called morphing of America. Changing from lamb to dragon. &gt;&gt; You remember that? &gt;&gt; The morphing of America. And I use the terminology the turning point of America is going back to the mother church just into a form of godliness but denying the power there thereof. And then I preached the next week that the end time prophecies are matching the end time message. This has so deeply affected me. I don't want my sermons to just be flowery and nice and we're all going to heaven and aren't you glad you're part of this elect and no. I want I want you to know we're in battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; and sometimes I get a little weary &gt;&gt; sometimes when a fighter is in there and he gets hit. Who was it? Mike Tyson said, "Oh yeah, I have a game plan for every fight until I get my bell rung." &gt;&gt; And then he said, "Then it becomes instinct. I back up onto the ropes. Back up. Cover up. Cover up. Get my [sighs and panting] get my stamina back." And then all of a sudden &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; The word fire appears in the Bible over 549 times. And there is no other symbol or natural effect nor type within the Bible that types God more than fire. &gt;&gt; Fire. God likens his spirit baptism to a baptism of fire. The most clean cleansing agent I can think of is fire. &gt;&gt; John said, "I baptize you unto repentance." That's good. Just water. But there's one coming after me &gt;&gt; whose baptism is far greater. For he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire. &gt;&gt; God give us ministries who are flames of fire. I don't want our young ministries here that these younger ministries that just preach nice little sermons, you know, and and flowery and everything like that. And you go into your AI computer and you go there and you search through the message some sermon topic and you take the topic, you find what brother Ram said. I give just give you an example, the love of God. And maybe you type in you put the the the you know the little whatever quotation marks around it. So type in love of God and oh guess what there's 560 quotes on the love of God. So I'll take this one and this one and this one. Cut and paste. And in order to really have an emphasis OF THE QUOTE I'LL READ THE QUOTE. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID HALLELUJAH. DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT HE SAID? HERE'S WHAT HE SAID. HALLELUJAH. AND THINKING THAT VOLUME IS ANOINTING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; If you want to get somebody's attention here, &gt;&gt; you ever been in a crowd of people and you say, "Hey, hey, I I got something to tell you." Everybody, hey, hey, keep talking. Ain't none of your business. God likens his spirit baptism to that of fire. And I told you that wherever you find the pillar of fire, you'll find God's voice. You brethren in the back there that are on the computer, I want you to find a picture of Brother Brendan with the pillar of fire above his head, I want you to just use AI right now. And I want to see a picture that was taken of the pillar of fire because wherever you find the pillar of fire, look for his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good &gt;&gt; because over 33 times in your Bible, whenever you see the pillar of fire, it's associated with God's voice. When you're ready, let me know. Fire represents his voice. God speaks from the midst of fire. I read that to you from Deuteronomy. How? Oh, there it is. Brother Brennham said that picture alone will condemn the world. He said, "Even that woman that looked at it one time and she snickered, &gt;&gt; she blasphemed God." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "For you to have that picture taken and for you TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT WITH YOUR PHYSICAL EYE is actually more evidence than if you saw it &gt;&gt; physically." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; So all of you get ready. He allowed you to see this picture &gt;&gt; because you know what God is doing. And listen to me. Listen to me carefully. This was for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God was vindicating. &gt;&gt; This is my messenger. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. Because out of the midst of fire, wherever you find the pillar of fire, you'll find God's voice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When Moses saw that pillar of fire and he stopped and he it was an attraction on the mountain &gt;&gt; and he CAME INTO THE PRESENCE OF FIRE. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? IT CHANGED HIM. &gt;&gt; May I say this to all of you? HOW CAN YOU COME INTO THE PRESENCE OF THIS PILLAR OF FIRE AND THIS VINDICATED MESSAGE AND IT NOT change you? &gt;&gt; Because if it doesn't, you're not seed. &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you straight out. &gt;&gt; Because if it's BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, WATCH. HE said when the elected come under that anointing, it'll quicken them. BUT HE SAID NONSEED. &gt;&gt; Got to look at [laughter] Ain't nothing to it. &gt;&gt; Remember May the 7th, 1946 that an angel appears and said, "Now's the time." And Israel became a nation. And here, Matthew 24, behold, when you see the fig tree put forth her buds, &gt;&gt; the time is nigh. Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; So here the very same time, very same hour, Israel became a nation is when this prophet is commissioned &gt;&gt; to go out. Then January the 24th, 1950, they took that picture. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; 1950. He's preaching a convention in Houston, Texas. [clears throat] And the man that was hired was a professional photographer. And he's he was hired by critics &gt;&gt; to try to disprove brother Ram. And so now this professional photographer professional taking all. And guess what? Of all the pictures he took, there was only one that was developed. So they took that and they sent it away to the curator of facts &gt;&gt; want to know. They came back and certified. &gt;&gt; He said the light struck the lens. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a figment. &gt;&gt; It wasn't added. It wasn't where you can photoshop something. This was not photoshopped. &gt;&gt; And you take it lightly &gt;&gt; about this message. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; And you play around with it. You maybe you don't take it serious enough. I'm as serious about this message as I am a heart attack. &gt;&gt; I love it. &gt;&gt; Because when I came into this understanding of the message, I was caught on fire. &gt;&gt; Spontaneous. 18year-old kid &gt;&gt; not knowing nothing. &gt;&gt; It caught fire. &gt;&gt; I've tried to lay down and roll and put it out and I can't. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, it's consuming. &gt;&gt; And I love it more today. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Than I did when I came in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not looking to get out of the message. &gt;&gt; I'm looking to get more into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the message is Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then January 1961, pillar of fire draws on the wall of the tabernacle. The people saw it. &gt;&gt; Through the seven church ages. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother Rem talks about a throne of mercy and judgment. Cons confirming the seven church ages are the seven lamps burning with fire. &gt;&gt; In December of 1962, he's got a vision of seven mighty angels. &gt;&gt; He says they came from eternity. &gt;&gt; Wings swept back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Mighty powerful angels. He says they came in in a moment like the twinkling of an eye. He says there I was in the presence and I WAS CAUGHT UP. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; INTO THE MIDST OF SEVEN MIGHTY ANGELS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LATER HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT EACH ONE OF THOSE ANGELS HAD A SEAL. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND THE FIRST ANGEL CAME TO HIM WITH THE OPENING OF THE FIRST SEAL AND SHOWED HIM THAT IT'S NOT CHRIST RIDING DOWN THROUGH THE AGES. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE ANTICHRIST. THE WHITE horse rider is the antichrist. &gt;&gt; In January 1963, he's up in Sabino Canyon as he's praying about this vision because there's a there's a loud noise. &gt;&gt; He says, "Is it mean my death?" Probably nobody can live through something such a blast. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you Listen, &gt;&gt; I don't want you just These are things that I want to rehearse in your I want to put you back into your memory &gt;&gt; though you already know these things. He's in 1963 up in Sabino Canyon. What does this vision mean? And there a sword appears into his hand. And I'm referred to Isaiah 66 15 and 16. Behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots a whirlwind to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. And for by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh. &gt;&gt; By fire and by sword. on February of 1963 in Sunset Mountain. It shall be light about the evening time. The path to glory you shall surely find. He's up there pillar of fire. He says it comes down. He says, "My I begin to tell the brethren, NO, RUN, HIDE, GET UNDER SOMETHING, for judgment's ready to strike." He said, "The mountains shook, the branches were cut off the trees, and he said, rocks were blasted into little three cornered pieces." He he said, "There I stood." And they watched Brother Brandham as he stood there and took his hat off. &gt;&gt; Do you realize he was transported up &gt;&gt; into another sphere? &gt;&gt; He was now being transported. This was not alien abduction. &gt;&gt; This was divine. AND &gt;&gt; HE'S CAUGHT up into the midst of seven mighty angels. &gt;&gt; He said there, I looked down, I could see the whole area of Sunset Mountain. &gt;&gt; He said, "Go back to Jeffersonville, for thus saith the Lord." &gt;&gt; He said, "You'll be given the revelation of the six seals." &gt;&gt; Did I say that wrong? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Why is it then that some people can tell you there's only six revealed in seven? That's why we need a return ministry. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; You got some kind of wild gourd you're throwing into the pot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anyway, &gt;&gt; so March 17th through the 24th, 1963, he starts opening the seven seals. The revival fire has now been lit. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The dross of the former teaching of this message now taken away. All of Clarence Larkin's dispensational truths and all of the pre- niasian fathers and all of the theological teaching and now burnt out of the mind of that prophet until he had nothing but the mind of Christ. Now, let me bring this to a close with just telling you about another baptism of fire. Just as the natural man has got to go through water, blood, spirit, fire, water, blood, fire, right? Are we together on that? &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "So does the earth." &gt;&gt; He said, "It's got to receive its baptism of fire." &gt;&gt; And he said, "The next plan for the earth is a battle called the battle of Armageddon." &gt;&gt; Revelations 17 verse 12-1 17. And the 10 horns with thou saws are 10 kings which have received no kingdom as yet, but receive power as kings one hour with the beasts. And these having one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast, and these shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is the Lord of lords and King of kings. And they that are with him are called the chosen and faithful. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he saith unto me, the waters which thou sawest, where the siteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues, and the tens horns which thou saw upon the beast. These shall hate the &gt;&gt; and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his will and to agree and give their kingdom under the beast until the words of God shall be fulfilled. Russia is now being raised up to destroy Romanism and the Vatican. Sure. &gt;&gt; In second Peter 3:es 9-12, the Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness, &gt;&gt; but is long-suffering to usward, and not willing that any should perish, but all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and with the elements that shall melt with fervent heat. The earth also, and the works therein there shall be burned up, seeing then all these things shall be dissolved. What manner of person ought we to be, and all holy conversation and godliness, &gt;&gt; looking for and hastening under the coming of the day of God. wherein the heavens being on fire which shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with a fervent heat. Brother Bram said before one bomb drops here in America. He said the bride will be in glory. &gt;&gt; Now I'm closing musicians if you come. I was with brother Joseph Brandham. We were We were in Louisville. We were just driving around and Brother Joseph pulled his car up to a certain intersection. I'm sorry. I don't I didn't memorize. He said, "Brother Ron, do you know anything about this intersection here?" He didn't say 8th and Penn Street. I know that's tabernacle. He said, "You know anything about this intersection?" He said, "No, sir, I don't." He said, "This is where the first bomb that hits America is going to strike right here at this intersection in Louisville, Kentucky." He said, "It's the most evil, corrupt city in America." Go read it. &gt;&gt; It talks about Louisville &gt;&gt; and it's just across the river, just across the bridge. So now, brother Brennham says in the sermon victory day, we've had many great battles, spiritual battles, many great V days that your church has had. I mean, the church, the body of Christ. I'm not talking about the organization system. Now, I'm talking about the body of Christ, the body of believers down through the ages have had many great V-Days. We talk about we have had several wars. The wars and rumors of wars and V days and V days and V days. It'll finally wind up into the great battle of Armageddon. That'll be the last of it. When she comes to the battle of Armageddon, that'll set the whole thing. That'll settle the whole thing. Just before the great millennium, Armageddon is to clean off the earth. She purifies herself with atomic bomb blow atomic blowing and volcanic ash and things sink sinks this soaked blood of men upon the earth and sin and crime. She sinks beneath the earth and a volcanic braze out again and renews and cleanses the earth for the great millennium. He cleanses his church during that time for a people to live here. God is allowing Russia, listen to me. He said, "Watch Russia, king of the north." He said, "Amageddon is a cleansing, but he said there's coming another greater cleansing." &gt;&gt; One is a man cleansing, then there's a cleansing of God. &gt;&gt; There will be a new heaven and a new earth. The new Jerusalem will establish itself upon the earth. Brother Ram said in future home of the heavenly bridegroom, a holy fire from God which cleanses the earth and the heavens around it. Then it's purchased so that the redeemed can live on it live in peace. Notice the baptism of fire is to cleanse it from sin, from sickness, from disease, germs, from sinners, from the death, from the devil, and all of his groups. He is to be cast out into the lake of fire. Holy fire from God comes down from God out of heaven and turn and and burns it up. Notice and make it ready for God to dwell in for God in the new world that is to come is to dwell in the earth. The same plan of redemption to use both the world and the persons that live in it. The last quote there on future home. And when the earth is restored by the same thing, there are no more no more cursing, no more storms, [music] no more winds, no more typhoons. They are reconciled. Man and God has met. The new earth will be put on its Eden beauty again. The new earth will spread forth her after her baptism of fire. Oh, she'll catch a fire and burn up. The elements will burn with fervent heat. All the works in the earth will burn. The water will explode. Did you know in the first time that I read it in the book of Revelation because I'm a surfer. Once a surfer, always a surfer. I just retired from it, but I still think it's the greatest sport. And the Bible says in new heavens and new earth. And there was no more sea. And Ron wept. &gt;&gt; Me too. &gt;&gt; I said, &gt;&gt; "No more sea. What about surfing?" I thought about the perfect wave and how I'm going to get up there and I'm just going to surf and all you guys can go do what you want to do. I'm just going to go surfing and there's no more sea. So the next thing you know, I had a little dream and all of a sudden the clouds started to shape take a shape of a swell and I paddled into it. Ah, it's just a dream. Brother Bram said, "If I could make you understand that the life down here is like a pig." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the best part of this earth &gt;&gt; Yeah. is no more than a &gt;&gt; a vile pig's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Would you want to go back to that?" &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, this message, let's not let the revival fire of this message die. &gt;&gt; As a pastor, I say, "Let's refuel it." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the direction I'm heading for next Sunday &gt;&gt; is how to refuel your fire &gt;&gt; because listen, this little bride is not going to go with just some kind of little &gt;&gt; little fizzle. &gt;&gt; Huh? I've told you before, you ever had firecrackers? You light them and all of a sudden, you know, there there's ones that boom. We as kids, man, we like the louder, the better, the bigger pow M80s, barrel bombs, all of these cherry bombs, everything. We just man get them. She We're blowing everything up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then we had the firecrackers, you know, black cat and all this stuff. And we light it in that little hot [music] gym. It goes, we light it and everybody's standing there waiting for it and then it goes, "What a joke. I don't want no littlemen." &gt;&gt; So, you know what we found you could do now? Oh, I bet. Now, I'm not going to tell you. [laughter] You kids will do it, &gt;&gt; but I don't want you to do it. But this little bride is not going to go out. &gt;&gt; He said, "You watch that third pull then?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "What you've seen temporarily." &gt;&gt; He said, "It'll be manifest in the fullness of its power." You ain't seen nothing yet. Now, it ain't something you got to manufacture. You don't have to say, "Hey, I'll get out here and it's going to be some minister and he's going to have some great revelation and all of you going to have to come to him and you're going to have to get it because if you ain't uh under his ministry, you're not in THE BRIDE." AH, STOP IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; There's one belt messenger given TO THE SAGE WHO is his vindication is to take your heart AND TAKE IT BACK TO THE FAITH OF YOUR FATHERS. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. It's not the ministry of a man. &gt;&gt; It's the ministry of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I do. &gt;&gt; I love him with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like I said, I don't want to break down. I don't want to burn out. I want to break out. &gt;&gt; I want to be consumed. I do. I take it personal. When some of you struggle, you don't come to church. You don't get into it like you should. Come on. &gt;&gt; Some of you it's just become a form. &gt;&gt; Some of you I won't see until the next feast, &gt;&gt; then they show up. &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing? Everybody shows up for a feast and they don't show up for the word. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Brother Ron, we need to build a balcony. We'll start the balcony over here. We'll we'll go over here into this corner and that balcony will wrap around and go over here like that." And I said, "Not until we got as many Wednesday night as what we have Sunday morning." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I ain't going to build no balcony. Half of you will want to go sit up there and sit as far away from me as you can. Anyway, [laughter] I got problem with balcony sitters. &gt;&gt; Front row. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I listen. I'm going to bless all you guys on the front row right now. Bless you. Bless you immensely. Front row sitters. You ain't afraid. You getting close. Be careful because when I get on fire, hey, licks of fire start sparking off of me onto you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, you man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I tell you what, some of you need a little spark. &gt;&gt; Well, some of this when it's the real Holy Ghost, the more you blow on it, &gt;&gt; the greater the fire burns. &gt;&gt; Lord, I've delivered my heart this morning. I want all of you to look around you and see those that you see. See, look at your own life. You don't have to look at others. Look at yourself. &gt;&gt; I see maybe church becoming a ritual, becoming formal. the fire of revival dies down. And brother Bram said, "I'm afraid what this last end time will be is a few anointed preachers." And he said, "And some in the congregation sitting there trying to absorb what they're preaching." Oh, my desire is that each one of you meet the same pillar of fire &gt;&gt; that Paul met on the road to Damascus. &gt;&gt; That you meet the same pillar of fire the prophet of God met. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; The same pillar of fire that I met. Because you know what? My life's &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. my scholarship to San Diego State University for marine biology specializing in the field of underwater archaeology. I only went my first year of college and guess what? I loved it. I wasn't You know what? I couldn't wait to get out of high school because high school is babysitting. Uh we're going to take roll call. Uh Ron, are you here? Say here. Uh, Flo, are you here? Say here. Uh, you know, Johnny, are you here? Here. Yeah. Yeah. Stop it. In college, they said, I don't care if you come to class or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, in fact, the toughest class ever had, the prophet, the the professor, you know what he said? It's open book test. Bring all your notes. Bring your book. And he says, because most of you are going to fail. So he said, [music] "So I'm here. I'm not going to babysit you. I don't care if you even show up for class." And he said, "And so an open book test, how many know that's the hardest &gt;&gt; because you know, oh yeah, I got that in my notes." Oh, yeah. Hang on, hang on. Yeah, I I know. I know. I put it in red somewhere. Yeah. uh you waste all the time because if you don't know the answers, &gt;&gt; you're sitting there researching and finding turn in your ain't even done. Did you know this is an open book test? &gt;&gt; This ain't a time to go and huh it's open book. &gt;&gt; How many of you have gotten into the open book? How many of you have gotten into the revealed word of the hour? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; And pardon me, brother null, to use you as another example, but take an 81y old man. I'm 72. I'll be 73 in December. I'm done with this overseas stuff. It's hard, &gt;&gt; Sister Shirley. Is it tough? Huh? Yeah. It ain't easy. So, which one of you will go for me? Which one of you will carry the lamp &gt;&gt; and the fire of God, not let it go out? Which one of you will be the preacher of tomorrow? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because there I ain't always going to be your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go off the scene one of these days. I don't know when, but I it's just it's inevitable. If the Lord carries, some of us won't be here next week, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's happening. David McGary, they asked him, they called him the elder. And he said, "Don't say elder because that means the next one that's going to go missing." [laughter] So, they called him the youngest elder. I realize it's just a few more days of the sun. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; It's just part of life. &gt;&gt; I've I've poured out my heart to you this morning. &gt;&gt; And I want all of you to realize I can't carry this load myself. It's too rough. it. I become overburdened. It's too heavy. I can't I can't do it. Is there somebody here that says, "Brother Ron, I'll help carry it. I'll help carry the log." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Is there anyone else that'll stand with brother Sean? Say, "I got your back." &gt;&gt; I'll carry the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You young man, just a few days ago, you were born. The first baby born after I became pastor this year. How old are you now? &gt;&gt; 32. &gt;&gt; 32. Look at these guys. Huh? You guys were the young kids when we went out and we went quail hunting. Huh? I had James Laval as my personal bird dog. I'd shoot it. He ran what it want. He'd go and get the bird and come bring it back. Put it in my little pouch. We have grown up together. You realize it, Stephen. Jonathan, we've grown up together. I'm getting to be an old man. Now you guys. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to [singing] live the way he wants me [music] to live. I want to give [singing] until there's just no [singing and music] more to give. I want to love [singing] love till there's just [music] no more. &gt;&gt; I could [music] never [singing] ever love the Lord. [music and singing] Once again, &gt;&gt; I want to live [music] the way.

No one knew [music] how alone I was feeling and the emptiness [music and singing] I tried so hard to hide. &gt;&gt; Oh, I laughed and [music] said my life was fine [singing] without you. I was covering [music and singing] up the s tears I cried. Then one day someone told me of [music and singing] your mercy of the love you showed on a hill called Calvary. [music and singing] There you purchase my redemption. When you [music] broke sin's power, set my spirit praise. [music] Oh, I'm amazed that [music] you love me.
