[14:38] Amen. Our prayer requests this morning.
[14:40] First, a note from Sister Carolyn Hunt.
[14:43] [Music]
[14:44] Thank you to my church family for your
[14:47] prayers during my recent surgery. I
[14:49] appreciate every card, every phone call,
[14:51] and every text message. I'm thankful for
[14:54] all that the Lord has done for me and
[14:56] for his faithfulness, blessings to you
[14:58] all. So, it's good to have her back
[15:00] today. God bless you this morning. Amen.
[15:03] Our needs this morning that we'd like to
[15:05] present to you. Want to remember brother
[15:06] Ron and Sister Sandy as they're in South
[15:09] Carolina. Be coming home tomorrow for
[15:11] traveling mercies for them. Brother
[15:13] Steven McNeely as he travels home from
[15:15] Australia. Ask for traveling mercies. We
[15:17] have a lot of saints that are traveling.
[15:18] Let's remember them. Brother Tom Ya
[15:22] Thomas Yazy would like us to remember
[15:24] their family and friends in the Window
[15:25] Rock St. Michael's area. Uh their entire
[15:28] community has been in evacuated due to
[15:31] the Oakidge fire. It's still burning
[15:34] literally in their backyards. We're
[15:36] asking prayer that the fire gets under
[15:38] control soon. So, let's remember the
[15:40] Yazy family and their friends up there.
[15:43] The Lord would make a way for that fire
[15:45] to be put out. Amen. And our brother
[15:47] Russell Wallace
[15:49] has a need in his life and he sent me a
[15:51] text on Thursday. On Wednesday, Brother
[15:54] Russell had a teleconference call with
[15:56] his doctor to go over the results from
[15:59] his recent biopsy. Brother Russell said
[16:02] it wasn't too encouraging. The results
[16:04] that came back show an aggressive
[16:06] prostate cancer. And he had the doctors
[16:08] put Brother Russell in a high-risisk
[16:10] group. Brother Russell is scheduled to
[16:12] have scans to make sure the cancer
[16:14] hasn't spread. He goes, "I'm trusting
[16:16] and I'm resting completely in the Lord,
[16:19] but I appreciate any and every prayer."
[16:22] So, let's remember our brother Russell.
[16:24] He has a need in his life. He's a
[16:26] servant of God. He's actually at BYC. He
[16:29] and Sister Elizabeth being servants to
[16:31] the youth at that youth camp this week.
[16:33] So, let's remember him. May the healer
[16:35] come by his way. Let's touch our brother
[16:37] Russell. Let's remember him and the Lord
[16:40] would touch him in a mighty way. Do you
[16:41] have a need today? If you do, healing is
[16:43] here.
[16:45] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[16:47] today, and forever. And he's a healer of
[16:49] our hearts, our minds, our soul, and our
[16:52] body. Whatever your need is, put it
[16:53] before him. Let's sing that one more
[16:55] time. Brother James Love, will you come
[16:56] pray for our needs today and open our
[16:58] service in prayer? Healing is here. You
[17:00] got to believe it. You got to receive
[17:02] it. Trust in him this morning. Healing
[17:04] is here. Oh, healing is here.
[17:11] Oh, healing is here.
[17:18] Healing is here
[17:23] and I receive it.
[17:28] Oh, healing is here.
[17:33] We believe, Lord, healing is here. We
[17:38] trust you, Lord. Lord,
[17:41] healing is here
[17:46] and I receive it. You pray with brother
[17:50] James as he leads us in a prayer this
[17:52] morning.
[17:54] Let's bow our heads. Hallelujah. Lord, I
[17:56] thank you for his
[17:59] worship. Jesus is here. Amen.
[18:04] [Music]
[18:06] And when you come by, Lord, that's when
[18:09] things happen. That's when lives are
[18:11] changed and needs are met. Oh, God.
[18:16] And a pardon isn't a pardon unless it's
[18:18] received. And Father, we receive it this
[18:21] morning. We've come with faith
[18:23] believing, oh God, that healing is here,
[18:26] deliverance is here, freedom is here, oh
[18:29] God. Because in your presence is when
[18:32] lives begin to be touched, oh God. And
[18:34] as I hold in my hands these needs that
[18:37] Lord, they were pinned down in faith, oh
[18:39] God, believing that there is a healer,
[18:42] that there is one that is greater than
[18:44] their sickness. There is one that's
[18:46] greater than the need in their life. And
[18:48] Father, as we've gathered,
[18:52] [Music]
[18:54] Lord, I lift up brother Russell and your
[18:57] Lord, a faithful servant. Lord, one that
[19:00] has sacrificed
[19:06] this doctor's report. But Father,
[19:08] there's a greater physician. There's one
[19:10] that can come into the room, oh God. And
[19:13] Lord, your prophet said that not even
[19:16] cancer can stand in our way. And so,
[19:18] Father, we stand on your word and on the
[19:21] basis of your word. And we ask that you
[19:23] would go and you would touch brother
[19:25] Russell that the fear of cancer and
[19:27] everything would be cast out, oh God.
[19:30] [Music]
[19:32] Lord, and as we gathered on this
[19:35] resurrection morning, oh God, we're just
[19:37] asking that you would come by our way,
[19:39] that you would minister to the hearts of
[19:40] your people, that you would speak to
[19:43] lives, that you would change lives. Oh
[19:45] God, come by my way. Oh God, I have a
[19:48] need in my life. And we're just asking
[19:49] that you would minister unto us.
[19:51] Encourage us by your word. For your word
[19:53] says, "Ask and you shall receive. Knock
[19:56] and it shall be open. Seek and you shall
[19:59] find." And so we're asking. We're
[20:01] knocking. We're here believing Lord that
[20:03] you would come by our way. Be in the
[20:06] song service. Lord, come. Let us create
[20:11] an atmosphere that you could come that
[20:13] you would speak words of life. Oh God,
[20:16] be with the rest of the needs. our
[20:18] pastor as he travels and brother Steve
[20:20] as he travels. Lord, we've come with an
[20:23] expectation in our hearts. Would you
[20:25] meet that expectation, oh God, knowing
[20:28] and believing you will in Jesus precious
[20:30] name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you,
[20:34] brother James. You may be seated this
[20:35] morning. Amen. Thankful for his presence
[20:38] here this morning that's in our midst.

[34:03] Yeah. All is vanity.
[34:07] All is negative.
[34:10] Even if you have a PhD,
[34:13] vanity or vanities.
[34:16] [Music]
[34:17] If you are beautiful,
[34:20] that's a shadow.
[34:24] Even if you own words, great treasures
[34:27] still vanity.

[36:21] [Applause]
[36:48] [Music]
[37:12] I saw the Lord
[37:18] seated on his throne,
[37:24] clothed in glory,
[37:30] exalted
[37:32] high
[37:36] and the train of his robe
[37:42] filled the temple
[37:47] and the angels circle
[37:54] around him and cry
[38:01] You are holy,
[38:07] oh so holy.
[38:12] You are holy, Lord of all.
[38:22] Woe is me
[38:27] for I'm unclean.
[38:32] Mine eyes have seen
[38:37] the holy
[38:39] king.
[38:43] He cleans my lips.
[38:49] Mhm.
[38:53] And the pillars
[38:55] shook
[38:58] and the angels
[39:00] cry.
[39:05] You
[39:07] are holy.
[39:11] Holo
[39:13] holy.
[39:16] You are holy Lord of all.
[39:26] You are holy,
[39:32] oh so holy.
[39:37] You are holy, Lord of all.
[39:46] I heard the voice
[39:51] presence of the Lord.
[39:56] Whom shall I send
[40:01] who live for me?
[40:07] Here I am.
[40:11] Won't you send me?
[40:17] Make me holy
[40:22] and I will go.
[40:27] Singing you are holy.
[40:34] Oh so holy.
[40:39] You are holy, Lord of all.
[40:49] You are holy,
[40:54] oh so holy.
[40:59] You are holy, Lord of all.
[41:14] Amen. Thank you, brother Nick,
[41:17] Brother Moses. Thank you for those song
[41:19] specials today. Amen. Let's stand and
[41:21] sing this morning.
[41:28] Okay. Take me into the Holy of Holies.
[41:30] Take me into the Holy of Holies. Amen.
[41:34] He sung He sang the song of Isaiah
[41:36] there.
[41:38] I want to sing that song this morning.
[41:41] Take me into the Holy of Holies. Amen.
[41:44] Isaiah says, "Here am I, Lord. Send me.
[41:47] I'm a man of unclean lips." You and I
[41:49] live in a land of people with unclean
[41:51] limbs, but we want to be holy as he just
[41:54] thought, but there's no holiness in us
[41:56] except the Lord Jesus Christ. Can you
[41:59] say amen this morning?
[42:01] Take me past.
[42:04] Brother Martin, if you'll come out this
[42:06] morning and to the holy place,
[42:12] pass the praise altar.
[42:17] Lord, I want to see your face.
[42:22] Take me past the crowds of people
[42:27] and the priests that sing your praise.
[42:32] Lord, I hunger and I thirst for your
[42:35] righteousness
[42:37] and it's only found in one place.
[42:41] Take me in to the holy
[42:47] of holy.
[42:51] Take me in by the blood
[42:56] of the lamb
[43:01] and take me in to the
[43:06] plea of holies.
[43:11] Take the cold, cleanse my lips here.
[43:18] second verse. Sing it as a prayer to him
[43:20] this morning. In the outer court I'm
[43:25] justified,
[43:27] but in the holy clay he's made clean.
[43:32] But in the holy of holies
[43:37] is the Holy Ghost itself.
[43:42] Mighty presence of Jehovah.
[43:47] and die a prisoner of this is my prayer.
[43:51] Lord help me so you can rise. Send me a
[43:57] capt.
[43:59] Take me in
[44:03] to the God bless you this morning. Holy
[44:08] [Music]
[44:10] take in by
[44:15] of the lamb.
[44:17] [Music]
[44:20] Take me in to the holy
[44:26] of holy.
[44:27] [Music]
[44:30] Take the gold.
[44:35] Here I am. Take the cold, cleanse my
[44:38] lips.
[44:40] Take the cold, cleanse my lips.
[44:46] Here I am.
[44:52] Yes, father.
[44:54] Unworthy we are, Lord, to stand in thy
[44:56] presence.
[44:57] [Music]
[44:59] We are born in sin and shaped in
[45:02] iniquity. come into this world speaking
[45:04] lies.
[45:06] But Lord, it pleased you. Like Isaiah in
[45:08] the temple
[45:10] on that day,
[45:13] a chosen group, you pulled him up into
[45:16] the holy of holies. Father, thank you,
[45:19] Jesus. Whereby he was able to see the
[45:21] throne.
[45:24] And the throne is a reward for this age
[45:26] of Leodysia.
[45:29] Not just to behold it, but Lord, to be
[45:31] partaker of it, Father,
[45:34] whereby Lord we be made clean.
[45:38] Where Lord this tabernacle can rise in
[45:41] us. Not made of men hands, Father, but
[45:46] Lord by the pure word, the blood of the
[45:48] lamb. Yes. That lord father this morning
[45:52] may we look to the unseen father
[45:55] whereby we see the need lord of our
[45:57] precious brother Russell
[46:00] the family Lord with the fire behind the
[46:04] on the background Lord Jesus
[46:07] but Lord you are the one that conquered
[46:09] all sins and all disease and all
[46:12] situations father unto you Lord we
[46:16] coming Lord with boldness oh father god
[46:19] once again believing Lord that all that
[46:22] we have asked for Father we have
[46:25] received it Lord by faith in Jesus name
[46:28] because your prophet says faith is not
[46:32] shall be but is now
[46:37] it's not a hope
[46:39] check was given unto us thank you Lord
[46:42] we feeling Lord our needs and our
[46:44] redemption in the flesh father
[46:47] the down payment made has been made.
[46:51] We're looking onto that day, Lord, that
[46:53] we shall depart from here whereby our
[46:56] home is set and ready to receive us
[47:00] while we are being aligned. Lord, we've
[47:02] heard theophanes on a daily basis,
[47:04] Father. Listening to the voice of God on
[47:07] the tapes.
[47:09] Make us, Lord, closer and closer with
[47:12] you, Father.
[47:14] All we ask your presence, Lord, in Jesus
[47:17] Christ's name.
[47:18] Amen. Amen. May the Lord bless you,
[47:21] saints. Uh without further delay, let's
[47:25] take the book of uh Exodus chapter 40.
[47:31] We read three verses, then we'll go to
[47:33] first Corinthians.
[47:43] Then a cloud covered the tent of the
[47:45] congregation and the glory of the Lord
[47:47] filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not
[47:50] able to enter into the tent of the
[47:52] congregation because the cloud haded
[47:54] abode their own. And the glory of the
[47:57] Lord filled the tabernacle. And when the
[48:00] cloud was taken up from the tabernacle,
[48:02] the children of children of Israel went
[48:04] onward in all their journeys. But in the
[48:09] but if the cloud were not taken up then
[48:12] they journeyed not till the day that it
[48:15] was taken up. Amen. 1 Corinthians uh
[48:19] chapter 2 verse 6 to 11.
[48:24] How bait we speak wisdom among them that
[48:28] are perfect. Yet not the wisdom of this
[48:31] world, nor the princes of this world
[48:33] that come to not, but we speak the
[48:36] wisdom of God in a mystery, even the
[48:40] hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[48:44] the world unto our glory, which none of
[48:48] the princes of this world knew. For had
[48:51] they known it, they would not have
[48:53] crucified the Lord our God. But as it
[48:57] has written, I have not seen, nor heard,
[49:03] neither have entered into the heart of
[49:05] man, the things which God have prepared
[49:09] for them that love him. Amen. But God
[49:13] have revealed them unto us by his
[49:16] spirit. For the Spirit searchth all
[49:20] things, yeah, the deep things of God.
[49:24] For what haveath man knoweth the things
[49:27] of men, save the spirit of man which is
[49:31] in him. Even so the things of God
[49:34] knoweth no man but the spirit of God.
[49:38] Amen. May the Lord bless the reading of
[49:39] his word. You may be seated. Surely
[49:42] father once again we coming before you
[49:44] in humility
[49:46] understanding Lord. It's not by might,
[49:48] nor by power, but Lord, because it is
[49:50] the spirit alone that is able to give
[49:53] unto us, Lord, the deep things of God.
[49:56] You are the one that give us the way.
[49:58] Lord, as we moving through thy word, may
[50:00] you bless, oh, Father, the service this
[50:02] morning. Uh remembering our precious
[50:04] pastor away from uh home and you be with
[50:07] him and all the saints, brother Steven
[50:10] and all the saints that couldn't make it
[50:12] or traveling. Lather be with them. We
[50:15] ask all these things in Jesus Christ's
[50:17] name. Amen. Amen. Uh once again, uh may
[50:20] the Lord bless you all and uh thank you
[50:23] for making it to service to this day. Uh
[50:27] we are continuing with uh I believe this
[50:31] will be part seven of uh
[50:35] what house will thou built me and we'll
[50:38] be taking uh we are into the holy of
[50:41] holies. Now we'll uh be talking about
[50:43] the five requirements to receive the
[50:45] revelation.
[50:47] uh some of the things that uh the
[50:49] prophet and prophet has addressed uh
[50:52] over time and believe it's uh quite uh
[50:55] important for us as believers to be able
[50:58] to address such a things and be able to
[51:02] know how to go about our earthly journey
[51:05] as we're building this uh tabernacled
[51:08] mystical body that we are by God's
[51:10] grace. uh as we just read uh here in the
[51:14] book of Exodus we uh been journeying
[51:18] through this book by God's grace and
[51:21] give the Lord has been so faithful unto
[51:24] us and keep uh giving us more and more
[51:28] uh we'll see how far he wants us to go
[51:31] by God's grace and he's uh making us run
[51:34] on two path at the same time but you
[51:38] know that uh he's always faithful and he
[51:41] knows uh where he wants to get us on to.
[51:45] I believe God's grace, we're looking
[51:48] forward unto him every day. Um the book
[51:53] of Exodus shows us uh that God has
[51:56] brought out Moses
[51:59] commissioned Moses in order for him to
[52:01] be able to go about and uh bring the
[52:04] children of Israel to build them a
[52:06] tabernacle. And as uh they were building
[52:09] the tabernacle, we've seen all the tools
[52:13] that they had along the time and uh it
[52:17] was come to the point where the
[52:20] tabernacle was erected. U everything was
[52:23] in place and it was uh therefore quite
[52:26] important now for the Lord to come down
[52:28] and dedicate the temple. And uh at the
[52:31] time of this dedication, we see that um
[52:35] as we saw on Wednesday that um um the
[52:38] tabernacle is not made out of human
[52:41] understanding, human ideas, but is it is
[52:45] made out of u the Lord uh word and uh
[52:49] this message of the hour. And as we go
[52:51] into the holy of holies, we see that we
[52:54] have the the ark of the covenant.
[52:57] Verbonam showed us that uh the ark of
[52:59] the covenant is the human heart. And
[53:02] this human heart shows that the ark had
[53:06] the tables of um the
[53:10] uh of the commandments, but also he that
[53:13] the ark had u pockets on the sides of it
[53:17] which were filled with the laws of the
[53:19] commandments. And these laws of the
[53:22] commandments we see that uh it is uh the
[53:25] message of the hour because this is
[53:28] whereby the interpretation of the
[53:30] commandment whereby we understand that
[53:33] uh the world has all kinds of
[53:35] interpretations of the Bible in this
[53:38] hour but by God's grace we have received
[53:41] the true interpretation of the of uh the
[53:43] Bible. The Bible become a new book. But
[53:46] then um when the Bible becomes a new
[53:48] book, it's not given unto us just to
[53:52] have have that as a statement. But then
[53:55] it is it puts onto us a journey whereby
[53:58] we started um in the beginning of the
[54:00] year that um the tabernacle had to be
[54:03] built because the Lord does does not
[54:05] dwell in the building made out of man's
[54:08] hand. as uh the temple was erected in
[54:12] the wilderness in the earthly journey.
[54:15] Um the natural, it typifies the
[54:18] spiritual um that um this tabernacle
[54:22] that this being built by uh the
[54:24] Christians that we are um comes to a
[54:27] point in our journey whereby that uh God
[54:31] himself has to come and crown it. We saw
[54:33] that on Wednesday that uh it begins with
[54:36] the baptism of the Holy Spirit. But then
[54:38] when we are baptized with the Holy
[54:40] Spirit, we are baptized. We are born
[54:43] again. We are born as a baby whereby we
[54:46] are growing into that revelation. We saw
[54:48] brother Brham um himself at 22 years
[54:52] old. He received the Holy Ghost and uh
[54:55] quickly 1933 right there. they started
[54:59] uh he was commissioned to start building
[55:01] the tabernacle uh physically and also
[55:04] have the people come around and uh also
[55:07] as early as he was 22 23 24 years old in
[55:11] the first campaign he had about 3,000
[55:13] people come that was brought to the Lord
[55:16] along the journey we see that brother
[55:18] Brhamam was growing himself in the
[55:20] revelation from the time he was 22 23
[55:24] years old all the way until he was uh
[55:26] about 37 years Brother Brham went about
[55:29] and he was preaching in the Bronham
[55:31] tabernacle. We do not have those
[55:33] recordings but we are able to uh
[55:36] reconstruct those timelines based on the
[55:39] facts that he's giving us uh throughout
[55:41] the tapes of the those events and the
[55:43] images that are made available unto us
[55:46] in this day. We see that u in 1946 the
[55:50] angel of the lord came to the prophet
[55:52] has uh he comes to the prophet the
[55:54] prophet gets hold of uh this new stage
[55:58] of his ministry we understand that prior
[56:01] to that he tells us in many tapes that
[56:03] he would take uh several months and
[56:05] several years and he's preaching uh the
[56:08] book of revelation the book of job in
[56:11] the uh to the church and some of the
[56:15] sisters would wonder how long will Will
[56:17] he will he was he ever going to finish
[56:19] that that teaching? So it is also we
[56:22] find oursel that we can see that in the
[56:24] church too when uh uh the the revelation
[56:27] is given unto the minister he can take a
[56:30] subject for as long as he can because
[56:34] the revelation keeps pouring. Then in
[56:36] this new journey uh new stage of the
[56:40] ministry where about he was given the
[56:42] two gift uh that uh two signs that he
[56:46] was to go about the world and uh uh pray
[56:49] for the sick and if he was more sincere
[56:52] he was going to know the very secret of
[56:54] the heart. Then quickly um we see around
[56:58] 1960 uh 525 53 he start getting tired of
[57:03] um praying for the sick and uh uh laying
[57:06] hands and a discernment to say well
[57:09] America has seen it all and I think I
[57:12] have to change my ministry and 53 around
[57:15] 54 uh then he start to try to change the
[57:18] ministry by preaching and going about
[57:21] and there are some more uh beautiful
[57:23] details how the services were done and
[57:27] how the change of uh the the um managers
[57:32] were leaving him and God was
[57:34] orchestrating everything in those
[57:35] manners. But we quickly start to see
[57:38] that brother was truly a good um
[57:43] representation or a good uh example unto
[57:46] us because as we are coming unto the
[57:49] Lord, we receive the Holy Spirit. We and
[57:53] we quickly realize that we are facing
[57:55] the very same pathway that the prophet
[57:58] had faced because this journey it's not
[58:01] merely like oh he's the prophet oh
[58:03] that's his life and I'll just go and
[58:06] live my life however I want no we are
[58:08] building this tabernacle according to a
[58:10] certain pattern and that pattern we
[58:13] understand that in the old testament
[58:16] brother Brham shows us that you know
[58:18] this tabernacle is what we are because
[58:20] we are the very temple of God. And now
[58:23] the only uh living being that the age of
[58:27] Leodysia has been able to see walk upon
[58:31] the surface of the earth. And we can go
[58:34] on the footsteps of the person is
[58:36] brother Brham that was one of the
[58:38] messengers in the right hand of God that
[58:41] was released unto us in this earth that
[58:43] we are able that in the we can see in
[58:46] the book um in the Bible that um as I
[58:49] said on Wednesday that the scribes were
[58:51] uh compiling most of the services that
[58:55] Paul would had into few chapters and
[58:58] things but then in this day we have so
[59:01] all the messages from beginning to the
[59:03] end despite that not all the messages
[59:06] per se but a very good um amount of
[59:09] messages that were recorded of brother
[59:12] Brham services whereby he can give us
[59:15] all these details in order for us to
[59:18] understand what is this journey of the
[59:21] temple that we are building. So we are
[59:23] not just building upon our own ideas. I
[59:26] think I can build the tabernacle in this
[59:29] manner. I think I can walk in this
[59:32] manner. No, no, no, no. But now we have
[59:34] the laws of the commandments in order
[59:38] for us to be able to build it according
[59:40] to perfection. Because if that is not
[59:44] done so uh you hire a contractor say you
[59:47] hire a contractor and you give him the
[59:50] uh the plan you know to build you a
[59:52] house and if you come back home and you
[59:55] don't find it according to the vision
[59:58] that you had in your mind that you will
[1:00:00] just not sign it in. you will not take
[1:00:03] that building because you know how much
[1:00:06] you've suffered. Jesus knows how much he
[1:00:08] has suffered, how he went to the cross
[1:00:10] in order to pay the price so that the
[1:00:13] bride can rise and be brought back to
[1:00:16] its original position. So therefore, God
[1:00:19] had to use one born in sin, shepherd
[1:00:22] iniquity, uh came come came to life, um
[1:00:26] speaking speaking lies like us in order
[1:00:29] for us to truly be acquainted with that
[1:00:33] kind of life. Because we can speak about
[1:00:35] Jesus, yes, Jesus was a man, but he
[1:00:39] didn't come by sin. Jesus by didn't
[1:00:42] bypass his theophony but all of us
[1:00:45] including brother Brandham have bypassed
[1:00:47] our theophony. Brother Brham had to be
[1:00:50] realigned with his theophony because the
[1:00:52] things that he did before his conversion
[1:00:55] till the things that we see after his
[1:00:58] conversion also puts us in the same
[1:01:01] pathway to understand oh I can identify
[1:01:04] with brother Brham when he was sick. the
[1:01:07] type of faith that he had when the
[1:01:09] doctor told him that uh you're going to
[1:01:12] die. I can identify with brother Brham
[1:01:15] when he could see his child u uh walking
[1:01:19] away from the word of the Lord. I can
[1:01:22] identify with brother Brham how he could
[1:01:24] intercede for his wife. I can identify
[1:01:27] we don't have that record for Paul. We
[1:01:29] don't have that record for Jesus. But
[1:01:31] then we know that Jesus paid the price.
[1:01:35] His journey can be unlocked for us.
[1:01:38] That's why that we see that along the
[1:01:41] church ages. Brother Brham says that
[1:01:43] when this word was revealed partially
[1:01:47] that truth was given to the people,
[1:01:50] people of that age were able to identify
[1:01:52] with that messenger and God will sell
[1:01:55] them away. But then in this hour that we
[1:01:58] are living in as the time goes on we see
[1:02:02] that the word comes in its fullness.
[1:02:05] It's not a partial word as we see in the
[1:02:08] time of Martin uh Martin Luther who
[1:02:11] would uh come and preach justification
[1:02:13] and leave all kinds of lives. Right? But
[1:02:17] then in this hour since the fullness of
[1:02:20] the word has come to pass then we can
[1:02:22] see how a man taken from all his
[1:02:26] miseries as he could pray as uh we read
[1:02:29] it on Wednesday he said that Lord you
[1:02:31] know I'm the most evil person on earth
[1:02:34] and I I don't deserve to deserve to
[1:02:36] leave but then the grace of God came and
[1:02:39] took him along the way. So it is also we
[1:02:42] can clearly identify with this journey
[1:02:45] to say like you know hey I have a
[1:02:47] perfect example. Amen.
[1:02:50] Because perfection is not on the basis
[1:02:53] of him that looked at you but perfection
[1:02:56] is from the whom who is perfect coming
[1:03:00] down in imperfect man and makes it
[1:03:03] perfect. Hallelujah. That's why the
[1:03:05] fullness of the word had to come down.
[1:03:07] If the fullness of the word had not come
[1:03:09] down, we would also speak of a partial
[1:03:12] revelation. But then we move from a
[1:03:14] partial realization to a perfect full
[1:03:18] realization. And when the prophet is
[1:03:21] going through that journey, he start
[1:03:23] understanding that we were predestinated
[1:03:26] before the foundation of the world. We
[1:03:28] were called and we are now being
[1:03:30] anointed in order to be placed according
[1:03:34] to our positions. And this great mystery
[1:03:38] being hidden to the princes of the
[1:03:40] world. The princes of the world will go
[1:03:42] about and say, "Oh, we'll do this here.
[1:03:45] We'll we'll do a climate change and
[1:03:47] we'll try to fix things here. You can't
[1:03:50] have a nuclear weapon and you can't have
[1:03:52] this here." Because this great mystery
[1:03:55] is hidden unto them. That's why we just
[1:03:58] read here that it's hidden to the
[1:04:01] princes of the world. But unto us this
[1:04:04] great revelation is given unto us. It
[1:04:07] pleas the father to give us these
[1:04:10] things. It's not that because we are the
[1:04:13] best among them all. Some some of us are
[1:04:16] still struggling with all kind of things
[1:04:18] porn and all these things here. But then
[1:04:21] when God looked at Paul he said like you
[1:04:23] know he is my but chosen vessel. Before
[1:04:27] even Paul knew in what condition he was
[1:04:30] persecuting the church. But God had seen
[1:04:32] in him that there was a seed planted
[1:04:35] before the foundation of the world. It
[1:04:38] is not a man willing to become seed but
[1:04:42] we were already seed in God's mind
[1:04:45] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:04:47] has now that word is coming down onto us
[1:04:50] then we are start being realigned
[1:04:53] partial realization. We're hearing the
[1:04:55] word day after day we are hearing and we
[1:04:58] are receiving. And the closer we are
[1:05:01] getting to the word, the more we start
[1:05:03] realizing
[1:05:05] who am I? I never thought I could be
[1:05:08] this way. I never looked at myself as a
[1:05:10] child of God. All my life I thought
[1:05:12] like, you know, I'm an engineer. I'm a
[1:05:15] I'm a this great architect. I can uh
[1:05:18] live however I want. But then when that
[1:05:21] word is start now coming to the seed
[1:05:24] then you start realizing then now you
[1:05:27] start taking the laws of the commandment
[1:05:30] the message of the hour then you start
[1:05:32] realizing let me get deeper into it.
[1:05:34] Yes. Amen. That's why we have this great
[1:05:38] message from 46 47 all the way to 65 to
[1:05:42] see how a man Amen. Amen. Born in sin,
[1:05:46] shaping iniquity from a family who had a
[1:05:50] ill name in the city
[1:05:52] and be brought to the stage of the world
[1:05:54] that everybody wants to have a time with
[1:05:57] him. That even to this day that his
[1:06:00] legacy because he had uh given his life
[1:06:04] away to Christ that to this day we can
[1:06:07] we are also beneficiaries of that very
[1:06:11] life that he dedicated to the Lord. So
[1:06:13] therefore we understand that what a man
[1:06:16] shall plant does what he shall reap. So
[1:06:19] if now we do as the Lord as the prophet
[1:06:23] did we are bound to receive the same
[1:06:26] result at the prophet did. So therefore
[1:06:29] we can't bypass the prophet the word of
[1:06:32] the prophet and expect to have another
[1:06:34] result. Right. Right.
[1:06:40] The prophet is showing us here in these
[1:06:42] five requirements that uh given unto uh
[1:06:46] the five requirements to receive the
[1:06:48] revelation. We understand that as we are
[1:06:50] coming into the church and we listening
[1:06:53] to the word and we saying amen to the
[1:06:55] word and these are wonderful things. But
[1:06:58] then it is so important to every
[1:07:00] Christian and each one of us to be able
[1:07:03] to get to that level to receive the
[1:07:05] revelation
[1:07:07] because you can brother say you can
[1:07:11] listen to your pastor you can listen to
[1:07:14] uh your research and development and
[1:07:17] everything that you've done and all the
[1:07:19] knowledge that you have received in in
[1:07:22] order to be able to to be out there. But
[1:07:25] then it requires a revelation to a
[1:07:28] certain stage. That's right. You can't
[1:07:30] expect a baby to receive the revelation.
[1:07:33] But then revelation is to given to them
[1:07:35] that are mature, to them that are ready
[1:07:38] to take responsibility
[1:07:40] because you can't explain uh uh a a
[1:07:44] somebody who's walking on the street
[1:07:45] that say, "Well, uh you are driving by.
[1:07:48] Uh I'm giving you this information about
[1:07:51] my company." No, it doesn't work. The
[1:07:54] person has to be first employed in your
[1:07:56] company. Once he's employed in the
[1:07:59] company, he goes through the test, all
[1:08:02] the interviews.
[1:08:03] What do you like about this company?
[1:08:06] What do we like about this message?
[1:08:11] There are all other messages out there.
[1:08:13] All the other churches.
[1:08:15] What Why did you Why did you apply to
[1:08:17] this company?
[1:08:20] Well, I see the sisters who dress well
[1:08:23] and
[1:08:24] you know, they're very natural and the
[1:08:27] sisters around our neighborhood, they're
[1:08:29] very kind. Okay, that's good. That's
[1:08:32] good. But you know that some of them
[1:08:33] also have weaknesses.
[1:08:37] Opra would say, well, if they all make
[1:08:40] mistake, that mistake, you know, they're
[1:08:41] not perfect. I'm going back to where I
[1:08:43] was.
[1:08:46] Somebody else will say, "Well, I'll make
[1:08:47] it. I'll stay a little longer." Well,
[1:08:50] you know, people can grow in things.
[1:08:52] Yes, that's good. Then we start now
[1:08:56] getting into the deeper things of God.
[1:08:59] The word made flesh. What?
[1:09:04] Eat your bread. Eat your flesh and drink
[1:09:06] your blood. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1:09:09] no, no, no. I have to go back to where I
[1:09:11] came from.
[1:09:14] Until uh Peter would say, "Lord, where
[1:09:17] shall we go?" Amen. Amen. It's you who
[1:09:21] have the words of eternal life. Amen.
[1:09:25] He looked at him and say, "Well, Peter,
[1:09:28] that's good, but it's not enough." Amen.
[1:09:32] Peter stayed tugged along for a little
[1:09:35] while. Some of us say, "We believe the
[1:09:38] message. We believe the message. That's
[1:09:40] good.
[1:09:42] Well, there's no other messages out
[1:09:43] there, churches out there that preaches
[1:09:45] the word like the message. That's good.
[1:09:48] But then now after Jesus death and
[1:09:51] resurrection,
[1:09:54] the time was come for them to go into
[1:09:57] the upper room to receive the Holy
[1:09:59] Ghost. After receiving the Holy Ghost,
[1:10:03] now comes now the work we're on to the
[1:10:06] purpose of the very life. Amen. Because
[1:10:11] Jesus sent the disciples and uh give
[1:10:13] them power to go and deliver the sick
[1:10:16] and all these things. All of us will
[1:10:18] desire that that when we come to church,
[1:10:21] they lay hands upon us. Oh, I I really
[1:10:24] believe that that ministry if you go
[1:10:26] under that ministry of you have any
[1:10:28] disease and uh send your your prayer
[1:10:31] request and they'll pray for you. That's
[1:10:33] it.
[1:10:34] It is good. Brother Abraham says here
[1:10:40] you know first point it's going to take
[1:10:42] the operation of uh of the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:46] He says Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:10:48] today and forever.
[1:10:51] He said, "Well, now I believe in praying
[1:10:53] for the sick, but not healing the sick
[1:10:57] and not giving them any virtue to be
[1:11:00] healed or any anything come from you
[1:11:04] that will heal the sick. I believe in
[1:11:07] praying for the sick." Yes, we believe
[1:11:09] in such a things that when we come to
[1:11:11] church, we can have this. But then
[1:11:14] there's a an whole another level because
[1:11:16] brother Brham as I just said went and
[1:11:19] meetings after meetings and thousands of
[1:11:22] people and he spend almost 8 days on the
[1:11:26] platform praying for people. The more he
[1:11:28] prayed for the more were coming.
[1:11:31] There were so many needs in the flesh.
[1:11:34] Then here now comes now the time where
[1:11:37] he said no no no no. I've we've prayed
[1:11:40] for the sick for so long.
[1:11:43] Yeah. We've spoken so much about, you
[1:11:46] know, clothing and uh uh dressing and
[1:11:49] and makeups and all these things here.
[1:11:51] We need to go a little bit further than
[1:11:53] that. Amen.
[1:11:57] Because if we just stay we stay with
[1:11:59] people like you know dress dress dress
[1:12:01] code it's fine but then another time we
[1:12:05] need to take them a little bit farther
[1:12:07] than that. That's right. But then if you
[1:12:10] look at yourself that you didn't pass
[1:12:12] the test of the first teaching,
[1:12:16] it'll be impossible for you to get to
[1:12:18] the other part. That's right. That's
[1:12:20] right. Don't be mocked. Don't be fooled.
[1:12:22] God is not mocked. If you did not pass
[1:12:25] even in school, you can't take uh the
[1:12:28] capstone subject if you didn't take 101.
[1:12:33] It's impossible. You have to pass 101
[1:12:35] first.
[1:12:37] along the journey. That's why we laying
[1:12:39] down the foundation of this tabernacle
[1:12:42] that so it be so clear in people's mind
[1:12:46] that well I need to understand where I'm
[1:12:48] at. Am I at the beginning? Am I in the
[1:12:52] middle? Am I heading into the holy of
[1:12:54] holies?
[1:12:56] And if I'm still in the beginning take
[1:12:58] time in there because as we just saw
[1:13:01] that in time past in the ages past it
[1:13:05] was a partial revelation of the word.
[1:13:08] Amen. When we preach about like you know
[1:13:11] dressing and uh natural hair don't cut
[1:13:14] your it is a partial revelation of the
[1:13:17] word. Right. You have to abide and be
[1:13:21] able the Lord to look at it and give a
[1:13:23] stamp of approval before you go on to
[1:13:26] the other.
[1:13:28] Then it's not to the preacher to come
[1:13:30] and tell you like, you know, why aren't
[1:13:31] you doing it? No, it's your
[1:13:33] responsibility. That's right. Because
[1:13:35] remember, we said that of your own
[1:13:39] choosing, you chose the lamp yourself.
[1:13:43] You chose the message yourself. It's not
[1:13:46] a a a pushing matter like, oh, you need
[1:13:49] to come and if you don't come, I won't
[1:13:51] pay your car. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[1:13:53] no. That's the Catholic spirit. That was
[1:13:57] saying like, you know, we need to take
[1:13:59] heresies out of people and all this bad
[1:14:01] doctrine. That was Paul before his
[1:14:03] conversion. That's right. But in this
[1:14:07] hour that we understand that the full
[1:14:10] revelation of the word has come unto us
[1:14:12] that this revelation brother I'm sure is
[1:14:15] that there are these five requirements
[1:14:17] in order for you to receive that
[1:14:19] revelation. It's not a revelation that
[1:14:22] randomly you come about and say like you
[1:14:24] know I have no no it's not a private
[1:14:27] interpretation.
[1:14:28] It's not a private revelation.
[1:14:31] It is God's revelation in the people.
[1:14:35] Amen. And that revelation can only come
[1:14:38] by the prophet. That's why we using the
[1:14:41] prophet as our example. We using the
[1:14:44] prophet as the perfect example.
[1:14:49] The world can call him all the one that
[1:14:51] call him. But God said in my right hand
[1:14:55] I only have seven of them and in this
[1:14:58] hour it's only William Brham. Amen.
[1:15:02] And all of us when we get someday help
[1:15:05] out there, we going to be under his
[1:15:09] leadership. That's right. All of us from
[1:15:13] brother Ron and all these other churches
[1:15:16] brothers and sisters with they pastored
[1:15:18] but all of us under the anointing of the
[1:15:21] seventh angel messenger. Amen.
[1:15:24] Brother Brham is showing us here we
[1:15:27] seeing uh the revelation of Jesus
[1:15:29] Christ. He said, "You will recall that I
[1:15:31] mentioned that at the beginning of this
[1:15:33] message that this book we are studying
[1:15:36] is the actual revelation of Jesus
[1:15:39] himself in the church and his work in
[1:15:42] the future ages." Remember on Wednesday
[1:15:45] we saw that Barnam shows us that the
[1:15:48] whole entire book of uh of uh the Old
[1:15:51] Testament is only made out of two
[1:15:53] teachings.
[1:15:55] speaking of the coming of the Lord to
[1:15:58] pay for the sacrifice and the anointing
[1:16:01] of the church throughout the earth
[1:16:04] and that simple sen
[1:16:07] that anointing the church speaks of us
[1:16:10] also that's why when we go back in the
[1:16:13] old testament if you don't see your life
[1:16:15] in the old testament read again because
[1:16:19] the entire book speaks of us when I look
[1:16:23] at Ruth I look at I see myself. When I
[1:16:26] look at Esther, I see myself. When I see
[1:16:28] Nemiah, I see myself. When I see Ezra, I
[1:16:32] see myself. Because I understand the
[1:16:35] anointing that the king will come and
[1:16:38] proclaim a degree in order to build
[1:16:40] what? The tabernacle.
[1:16:43] The entire book speak of the bride,
[1:16:47] speaks of the church. And this church is
[1:16:50] not made out of their own ideas. But we
[1:16:53] saw that in previous messages that
[1:16:56] Daniel understood by the books. What
[1:16:59] books? The books of the prophet
[1:17:01] Jeremiah. Why? How do we understand it?
[1:17:04] By the books. The books of who? Of
[1:17:06] William Brham. And it builds this
[1:17:10] tabernacle. And this tabernacle when he
[1:17:13] went across um beyond the curtain of
[1:17:16] time, it say like you know because you
[1:17:18] preach what you preach. Here comes the
[1:17:21] here's the pedestal. Step on it and all
[1:17:25] the saints over there said what we are
[1:17:28] resting on it. Amen. It is not a maybe
[1:17:34] it's not like you know like the Muslim
[1:17:37] Yeah, we will have. No, no, no, no. It
[1:17:41] has to be proven. Yes.
[1:17:44] Because when the young rich ruler died
[1:17:46] and he went over the keton of time also
[1:17:50] he find himself like you know wait I
[1:17:52] need to go back there. No no no no you
[1:17:54] are not one of the seven messenger to go
[1:17:57] beyond the kon of time and come back and
[1:17:59] to tell us what it is on the other side.
[1:18:04] He was trying to take a position that
[1:18:06] was not his.
[1:18:09] God had pro protected it to the
[1:18:11] appointed time because to them it was
[1:18:14] only a partial revelation.
[1:18:17] They say like you know they have
[1:18:19] ministers over there, they have prophets
[1:18:21] over there. Let them believe them. But
[1:18:24] then unto us, God has given us the
[1:18:27] promise and he has fulfilled the promise
[1:18:30] to unlock the mysteries that were hidden
[1:18:33] all these years that a man can go in
[1:18:36] hell and see how hell looks like and
[1:18:39] comes and tells us, "Sisters,
[1:18:42] watch out.
[1:18:44] Brothers,
[1:18:45] watch out because what you are doing,
[1:18:48] some of you it's only a representation
[1:18:51] of hell. But then also he goes on beyond
[1:18:55] the cartoon of time. He comes back down
[1:18:57] and says, "Sister, the angel of the Lord
[1:19:00] was so pleased when you were there at
[1:19:02] school. They wanted you to wear pants.
[1:19:06] You were healed because of that.
[1:19:12] Who is this person?
[1:19:15] Amen. Born in sin, shepherd in iniquity,
[1:19:20] but because of the fulfillment of time,
[1:19:23] now human beings that were once
[1:19:26] alienated from the presence of God are
[1:19:29] able not to go into the holy of holies
[1:19:32] and now bring back what was fallen in
[1:19:35] the Garden of Eden to be made manifest
[1:19:38] in this hour. A man could speak to the
[1:19:41] storm.
[1:19:42] Amen. Today they're speaking about
[1:19:45] climate change and all these things.
[1:19:46] Yeah, it's going to mess up the world.
[1:19:48] But then we have human beings
[1:19:52] that can stand and speak the word.
[1:19:56] Amen.
[1:19:58] Then I mentioned that then I mentioned
[1:20:01] that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[1:20:04] test to give us revelation or we will
[1:20:08] fail to get it. That's right.
[1:20:11] That's right. It requires the Holy
[1:20:14] Spirit. Then when you started born again
[1:20:17] Christian, you are walking this path.
[1:20:20] Without the Holy Spirit, this message at
[1:20:22] some point, if it's just an intellectual
[1:20:25] thing, you're going to give up. As you
[1:20:27] have seen, amen.
[1:20:32] You can come and get a a a job that
[1:20:36] covers all your bills and then you say,
[1:20:39] "Well, I'll just go find a part-time
[1:20:42] job." There's something wrong in your
[1:20:44] head.
[1:20:48] That's right. Because you can't go to
[1:20:51] where the word is p is preaching full
[1:20:54] and then you leave it and you say,
[1:20:56] "Well, I'll just go back to the
[1:20:57] denomination." Brother is wrong.
[1:21:00] Something is wrong somewhere. You can't
[1:21:02] go from partial revelation to full
[1:21:06] revelation and then you say, "No, no,
[1:21:08] no, no, no. Full revelation is too much.
[1:21:10] Let me go back to partial revelation."
[1:21:14] It's impossible to understand.
[1:21:18] That's why say in this day people will
[1:21:21] be neurotics, people go mad, people go
[1:21:24] crazy. Why? because their mind were
[1:21:28] alienated to the program of God. They
[1:21:31] were unable to follow God's pattern from
[1:21:34] the outer court choosing the lamb
[1:21:36] themselves and walking the path all the
[1:21:39] way to the holy of holies.
[1:21:43] It requires otherwise will fail to fail
[1:21:46] to get it. Bringing this to these two
[1:21:49] thoughts together. Baram say you will
[1:21:51] see that it won't take just ordinary
[1:21:55] study
[1:21:56] and thinking to make this book real
[1:22:01] but we just say that you know we have
[1:22:03] the message of the hour the revealed
[1:22:05] word. Yes we indeed.
[1:22:08] God surely knows that you know it's
[1:22:11] accessible to every person out there.
[1:22:14] You have the phone, you download the app
[1:22:16] and you can stream it, listen to it day
[1:22:19] and morning and stuff and still you
[1:22:22] don't get it. That's right.
[1:22:24] True. What is this message? I see
[1:22:27] brotherham say one thing here. Then he
[1:22:28] says another thing here. Oh, so too much
[1:22:30] contradiction in the message. No, you
[1:22:32] just are missing one key point. That's
[1:22:35] right. You've come along so good, but
[1:22:38] you failed to go into the holy of
[1:22:40] holies. Amen. You feel you failed to
[1:22:43] receive the Holy Ghost because if you
[1:22:45] had received the Holy Ghost the one of
[1:22:48] the requirements says that
[1:22:51] you should have the ability to hear from
[1:22:54] God. Amen.
[1:22:57] Because if we unable to hear from God,
[1:22:59] how are we going to make the walk?
[1:23:02] Amen. It will be a battle between the
[1:23:06] church and and you and your husband and
[1:23:10] and all these things here. But all those
[1:23:12] things were already taken care of under
[1:23:14] the new spirit. Not even the Holy Spirit
[1:23:18] under the new spirit.
[1:23:21] So if you are you say that we have
[1:23:24] received the Holy Spirit and we are
[1:23:26] still struggling with our husband,
[1:23:29] something has went wrong in the pro in
[1:23:31] the program.
[1:23:32] go back and receive a new spirit because
[1:23:35] all those things are taken care of under
[1:23:37] there under that partial revelation. And
[1:23:41] when we come into the full revelation,
[1:23:44] we are talking about different things.
[1:23:47] Amen.
[1:23:55] Adoption part four, the mysteries of his
[1:23:58] will. And remember how we how we hang on
[1:24:02] that. How many was in this morning?
[1:24:04] Let's see how we stuck on that. The
[1:24:07] mystery of his will. Now it is not just
[1:24:11] a little thing.
[1:24:13] Then it's a mystery. God's will is a
[1:24:17] mystery
[1:24:19] and each man has to seek out the will of
[1:24:22] God for his or herself. God's mystery.
[1:24:27] Amen.
[1:24:30] We seeing the prophet coming the
[1:24:32] journey.
[1:24:35] He's coming and he's listening to the
[1:24:37] word and he's showing us all this great
[1:24:40] pattern on how to read the Bible and all
[1:24:42] these things. As we read it on
[1:24:44] Wednesday, he says that in
[1:24:47] uh what what is a vision? He said like
[1:24:50] the angel came to me and told me what
[1:24:52] are you trying to do? You're trying to
[1:24:55] explain these things here and stuff. You
[1:24:57] don't even understand it yourself.
[1:25:01] Why was he not understanding it? Because
[1:25:03] it was not time for that.
[1:25:09] That's why all those type of quotations
[1:25:11] will give people all kind of business.
[1:25:14] But if he was a prophet, how how come
[1:25:16] was he not understanding it? No, you
[1:25:18] need first the Holy Spirit in you so he
[1:25:22] can teach you on how to connect all
[1:25:24] those things. Amen. Because despite him
[1:25:28] being the prophet, he has to work
[1:25:31] according to God's timing. That's right.
[1:25:35] We too have to work according to God's
[1:25:37] timing. Don't come on the pulpit of
[1:25:40] mystery. Seven seals. No, no, no, no.
[1:25:42] Walk the walk.
[1:25:45] Make proof of thy ministry, Timothy.
[1:25:50] Take your time. Don't rush.
[1:25:53] Oh, I can preach the mothers. I can do
[1:25:55] this here. No, no, no. Take your time
[1:25:59] because the Lord knows what we have need
[1:26:01] of. Amen. He knows us better than
[1:26:03] ourselves.
[1:26:05] Many times when we walk around and we
[1:26:07] see these warehouses being built from
[1:26:11] the outside, it looks good. But then
[1:26:13] when you go inside, no, no, no. We still
[1:26:15] have to do some wiring. We still have to
[1:26:17] do some lighting. We still have to uh
[1:26:19] put all the computer systems and then
[1:26:21] all these things here for everything to
[1:26:23] work accordingly.
[1:26:26] Some of us on the outer court we look
[1:26:28] good.
[1:26:30] We look good. We come to church hair cut
[1:26:33] and trimmed and everything but inside we
[1:26:36] know Lord you know my heart Lord. Lord
[1:26:40] you know I'm still struggling with this
[1:26:42] Lord. Lord, you know this year, he knows
[1:26:45] that because it is his will to show you
[1:26:49] the kingdom. He wants you to walk the
[1:26:51] walk with him. Amen.
[1:26:55] When Jeremiah said like, you know, I am
[1:26:57] unworthy. I'm unable to do anything. He
[1:26:59] said, "No, no, no, no, no. Wait.
[1:27:02] I have chosen you. I have called you. I
[1:27:07] have established you to be the prophet
[1:27:10] of nations." He couldn't see that in in
[1:27:13] himself. He couldn't tell that what
[1:27:16] potential because these are things that
[1:27:18] did not come onto the heart of men.
[1:27:22] You could you can't imagine
[1:27:25] what God has in store for you. Amen.
[1:27:28] Because it is a sealed mystery. The
[1:27:31] prophet said that you need to seek God's
[1:27:33] will for your life because you are a
[1:27:37] mystery yourself.
[1:27:39] That's why the devil is trying to play
[1:27:41] with it. Oh, maybe I should take him to
[1:27:44] drink. Oh, maybe I should have him have
[1:27:46] a girlfriend. Maybe I should have him do
[1:27:48] this here. He's trying all his best
[1:27:50] because he knows there's a great
[1:27:53] potential in these human beings that he
[1:27:56] is trying to get hold of. But then us
[1:27:58] now we have to understand
[1:28:02] you make the choice in order to have the
[1:28:05] revelation. Amen.
[1:28:08] First point, it is going to take the
[1:28:10] operation of the Holy Ghost. When the
[1:28:12] Holy Ghost comes into the human heart,
[1:28:15] we saw that the Holy Ghost takes over. 1
[1:28:17] Corinthians 2 and um and my speech and
[1:28:21] my preaching was not uh with enticing
[1:28:23] words of men, of men's wisdom, but in
[1:28:27] demonstration of the spirit and power
[1:28:30] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:28:32] wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
[1:28:36] Because this word when the Holy Spirit
[1:28:38] comes into us we see brother Brham that
[1:28:41] he was given two signs it was not on the
[1:28:44] basis of his ability.
[1:28:46] That's why the angel could tell him said
[1:28:48] do you think that you are the one who
[1:28:50] sees the vision?
[1:28:52] It was not him. It was not a man-made
[1:28:55] ability.
[1:28:57] It was nothing to do with his flesh.
[1:29:02] We'll read a quote here. will see a
[1:29:04] dead.
[1:29:05] Oh, we just read it actually. It says
[1:29:08] that now I believe in praying for the
[1:29:10] sick but not healing for the sick,
[1:29:13] healing the sick and not giving them any
[1:29:17] virtue to be healed. When the Holy Ghost
[1:29:21] comes in you, it has nothing to do with
[1:29:23] your ability.
[1:29:27] It is him doing the healing. It is him
[1:29:32] healing this thing. Our job is to lay
[1:29:34] hands to pray for the people and God
[1:29:39] take of the rest. Amen.
[1:29:43] It has nothing to do with us. That's
[1:29:45] right. Oh, this brother has the gift,
[1:29:48] brother. No, no, no, no. It has nothing
[1:29:50] to do with him.
[1:29:53] It is the Holy Ghost in the person.
[1:29:56] And when the Holy Ghost comes, he
[1:29:59] expects us to be to speak like uh John
[1:30:01] the Baptist. I have to decrease so that
[1:30:04] he can increase. And brother Bham say
[1:30:07] God is looking for people unto whom that
[1:30:10] he can bless and yet they can remain
[1:30:13] humble. That's right.
[1:30:16] When we receive a little bit of
[1:30:17] something, then we I have the
[1:30:19] revelation, brother. You don't you don't
[1:30:21] I'm respected in the world, brother.
[1:30:23] quickly you understand that's not
[1:30:26] according to the pattern that's not
[1:30:28] according to the program there's no need
[1:30:31] to f with it but it requires the holy
[1:30:34] spirit to come down he said uh spiritual
[1:30:37] church ages instead of uh straight word
[1:30:40] of god instead of the spiritfilled men
[1:30:44] in the church who were who were led by
[1:30:46] the by by spirit given revelation
[1:30:51] there are now creeds
[1:30:53] and by laws and educated guesses and of
[1:30:57] educ educated men learning has taken
[1:31:00] place of revelation. That's right. Look
[1:31:04] at the church message ages today.
[1:31:07] You have the table. Make some research
[1:31:09] quick. I'm right there.
[1:31:13] I'm ready for a sermon.
[1:31:15] Learning has taken place of revelation.
[1:31:18] Reason has replaced faith. Oh brother,
[1:31:21] you know, you know my condition,
[1:31:23] brother. You know, you know all this
[1:31:25] here. That's why it requires us to seek
[1:31:29] the will of God by revelation.
[1:31:32] Otherwise, we fall quickly into
[1:31:36] our own mind that I think I can do this.
[1:31:38] I think I can do that.
[1:31:41] It wasn't so um programmers replace
[1:31:44] spontaneous praise in the Holy Ghost. It
[1:31:47] wasn't so from the beginning. The whole
[1:31:50] piece has changed. It has become a
[1:31:54] hybrid church. That's right.
[1:31:59] But then that's not what the Lord is
[1:32:00] looking. He said like you know the
[1:32:02] requirement he requires the Holy Spirit
[1:32:05] to work in the people.
[1:32:08] And when these people in Romans 10, he
[1:32:11] says, "How then shall they call on him
[1:32:14] in whom they have not believed?
[1:32:18] And how shall they believe in whom in
[1:32:22] him of whom they have not heard?
[1:32:25] If you can't hear from him, how you
[1:32:28] going to work with him? And how shall
[1:32:31] they hear without a preacher?
[1:32:34] How are we going to hear the voice of
[1:32:36] God without a prophet in the land? And
[1:32:39] how shall they preach except they be
[1:32:42] sent?
[1:32:44] As it is written, how beautiful are the
[1:32:47] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[1:32:50] the peace and bring glad tidings of good
[1:32:53] things, but they have not all obey the
[1:32:58] gospel. Amen.
[1:33:01] People go to church and they listen to
[1:33:03] the word and over and over and over and
[1:33:05] over and they're still stuck in the same
[1:33:08] position. It is impossible for you to
[1:33:10] receive the revelation.
[1:33:13] Just work with God as he lays it down
[1:33:16] and you'll just see that everything will
[1:33:18] work out for you. Amen. Don't expect to
[1:33:21] go to the airport and then uh you don't
[1:33:23] follow the rules of the TSA and you're
[1:33:25] jumping from one lane to another.
[1:33:27] quickly you'll be in custody somewhere.
[1:33:32] You come to church, it's like, "Oh, no.
[1:33:34] This doesn't work. I don't like this in
[1:33:35] church. I don't know. I don't like that
[1:33:37] minister." Quickly, you find your mind
[1:33:40] clogged up somewhere. Before you know
[1:33:42] it, you're in the street.
[1:33:45] Nature tells us about all these things.
[1:33:48] Amen. The word is so perfect in
[1:33:51] simplicity that even when you wherever
[1:33:54] you walk, you start seeing the word
[1:33:56] because the word becomes made flesh
[1:33:59] becomes manifested before you. Amen.
[1:34:07] For Isaiah said the prophet, "Lord, who
[1:34:10] have believed our report?" So then faith
[1:34:13] cometh by hearing and hearing the word
[1:34:17] of God.
[1:34:19] The spirit is coming in not to to to
[1:34:23] entertain you to uh your own desires.
[1:34:27] No, no, no, no. It's according to his
[1:34:29] own will. Amen. He told Moses there as
[1:34:32] we just read it. If the cloud of glory
[1:34:35] moves then they moved.
[1:34:38] If the Holy Spirit say do this here you
[1:34:41] do it.
[1:34:43] It's not a desire of if I feel like it.
[1:34:48] Lord I need to reason with you first
[1:34:50] because the Bible say come and let us
[1:34:53] reason together.
[1:34:56] Brother says a man now wants to teach
[1:34:59] God on how to do That's right. Amen.
[1:35:05] Is this the sum of the answer? 260.
[1:35:08] Brother Burnham says, "The mystery of
[1:35:10] the baptism of the Holy Ghost without
[1:35:13] sensation,
[1:35:15] but the person
[1:35:17] of Christ performing in you the same
[1:35:22] works that he did." That's right. Amen.
[1:35:26] Without any virtues that you feel.
[1:35:30] without you feeling that you know
[1:35:32] something is working.
[1:35:35] No, no, no, no, no. Sensation,
[1:35:39] it comes on the pulpit and he just start
[1:35:42] talking to you in such a simplicity. Oh,
[1:35:46] I was expecting a lot of shouting and
[1:35:48] like no without sensation,
[1:35:51] a great mystery. And when he's
[1:35:54] delivering the word inside, it's like
[1:35:56] you know, yep, that's it. This is where
[1:35:58] I need to work with. Amen. This is where
[1:36:00] I need to work on.
[1:36:02] Because these things are so real. They
[1:36:05] are not things that uh uh because it's
[1:36:08] this brother or that brother. A sister
[1:36:11] came into the prayer line. She was at
[1:36:14] first doubting the minister. I don't
[1:36:16] really think that you know this brother
[1:36:17] can really do anything but I have no
[1:36:20] choice. My child is with uh is uh losing
[1:36:24] blood and let me just go. The brother
[1:36:27] just came. Yeah, pray for for her for
[1:36:30] for the daughter.
[1:36:33] Time has gone. And then she start
[1:36:35] observing.
[1:36:39] Went to the doctor. Everything is fine.
[1:36:42] Is this real? I didn't see any
[1:36:45] sensation. He didn't really do that such
[1:36:48] a big prayer.
[1:36:51] Then the husband went to the minister.
[1:36:54] Are you aware of this? No, I'm not
[1:36:56] aware. Yeah, this is happening when you
[1:36:59] since you pray for. Oh, okay. I didn't
[1:37:01] even know that she was sick for that.
[1:37:05] No sensation.
[1:37:08] Another another pastor saw say like you
[1:37:11] know, oh brother, you know, my child's
[1:37:14] been married for six years, no children.
[1:37:17] Okay, sister, sit down. How are you?
[1:37:19] How's life? And how's everything? The
[1:37:22] brother create the atmosphere. He prays
[1:37:25] for the child. this few months
[1:37:28] they're expecting no sensation
[1:37:34] at times that in other messages you see
[1:37:38] brother Brandham follows up on those
[1:37:41] some type of need in the prayer but in
[1:37:44] this case the brother didn't even follow
[1:37:46] up on it he just went and left
[1:37:50] but because it is not a man doing the
[1:37:54] work that's right God came and gave the
[1:37:57] child.
[1:37:58] God came and delivered the need.
[1:38:03] The Holy Spirit doing this work in us.
[1:38:06] Amen. Thank you, Lord. When you have a
[1:38:09] need, it's all about you hearing the
[1:38:12] word.
[1:38:14] You come with that faith in you. You
[1:38:17] stand there. God is going to honor it.
[1:38:20] Don't expect to any sensation of uh some
[1:38:23] forms I need this year. No, no, no.
[1:38:26] Because what God is doing from this
[1:38:29] first requirement is only building the
[1:38:31] blocks for you to receive the
[1:38:34] revelation.
[1:38:36] Brother Bam says if we don't have faith
[1:38:39] for divine healing, how we going to have
[1:38:42] faith for the rapture? That's right.
[1:38:47] God is very methodic.
[1:38:50] He wants you first to pass the first
[1:38:52] test. You go on to the next one. Don't
[1:38:56] expect always jumping, jumping, jumping.
[1:38:58] Yes, jumping is good. But then he also
[1:39:01] expect you to have a clear understanding
[1:39:04] of what he's doing.
[1:39:10] And this book of revelation or this
[1:39:12] revelation,
[1:39:14] brother Bam says on the second part that
[1:39:16] this this uh that means that this book
[1:39:20] can be revealed to any but a special
[1:39:24] class of people. That's right. Amen.
[1:39:27] That's right. The fact that God gives
[1:39:29] you that journey along the way and
[1:39:32] you've tagged upon Sister Ruth all these
[1:39:36] years that you were coming after Naomi
[1:39:39] and you were there. I'm walking with
[1:39:41] you. I'll be with you. I'll be with you.
[1:39:45] It already a sign that you are a class
[1:39:48] of people that were predestinated onto
[1:39:51] this revelation. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:39:54] But it's not limited onto that stage. He
[1:39:57] goes with you even further deeper
[1:40:04] because when the uh the the the uh the
[1:40:08] the Pharisees and and and the rest of
[1:40:10] them it said he answered and said unto
[1:40:13] them Matthew 16 2 and 3 when it is
[1:40:16] evening you say it will be fair weather
[1:40:19] for the sky is red and in the morning it
[1:40:22] will be full weather um it will be full
[1:40:24] weather today for the sky is red and uh
[1:40:27] and lowering. Oh ye hypocrites, ye can
[1:40:31] discern the first of the sky, but ye
[1:40:34] cannot discern the signs of the time.
[1:40:37] Why? Because it was not given unto them.
[1:40:41] Despite of all the knowledge and all the
[1:40:43] mental conception,
[1:40:45] nothing was able to get them there. In
[1:40:48] Matthew 16 13, the same chapter. And
[1:40:51] when Jesus now comes to the elect
[1:40:54] people, the class of this class of
[1:40:56] people, Jesus came into the course of
[1:40:58] Ceser of Philippi, he asked his his
[1:41:01] disciples saying, "Whom do men say that
[1:41:03] I am the son of man?" And they said,
[1:41:06] "Some thou John the Baptist, some Elias,
[1:41:10] some Jeremiah, and and one of the
[1:41:14] prophet." And and he said unto them,
[1:41:16] "But whom say ye that I am?" Amen. God
[1:41:20] is putting us on the spot. What do you
[1:41:23] say this message is?
[1:41:28] What do you say these messages?
[1:41:31] I believe brother Brandham. No. What do
[1:41:33] you say this is? Amen. I like to go to
[1:41:37] church because they have music. No, no,
[1:41:39] no, no. That's not the question.
[1:41:42] What do you say this message is? This is
[1:41:45] when now revelation kicks into place
[1:41:49] because everybody you've seen people
[1:41:51] come to the message and leave but you've
[1:41:54] stayed along for quite some time. What
[1:41:57] do you say this message is
[1:42:00] now? Peter and he said unto and and
[1:42:03] Simon Peter verse 16. And Simon Peter
[1:42:05] answered and said, "Thou art the Christ,
[1:42:08] the son of the living God." And Jesus
[1:42:11] said, answered and said unto him,
[1:42:13] blessed art thou.
[1:42:16] You are blessed if you have the
[1:42:19] revelation. Amen.
[1:42:21] So it's not it's not a you're not a
[1:42:24] random person. You're not just like the
[1:42:26] rest of the people. You are a blessed
[1:42:29] person to have the revelation of what
[1:42:32] this message is because we just read
[1:42:35] that you had to pray for God to give you
[1:42:38] that revelation.
[1:42:41] If I'm preaching the way I'm preaching,
[1:42:43] I must have the revelation.
[1:42:48] All my life, this is what I've been
[1:42:49] doing. God has given me the privilege in
[1:42:52] his in his house. all the position you
[1:42:55] name it I've done it
[1:42:59] but there were stages of my life as I
[1:43:01] was working
[1:43:03] Sunday school song leader music tech uh
[1:43:09] sound system video you name it I've done
[1:43:13] it
[1:43:14] oh brother you know I serve in the house
[1:43:17] of the Lord that's not it
[1:43:21] you need to go further than that Amen.
[1:43:25] But brother, you know, I'm married to a
[1:43:27] Christian believer. No, that's not it.
[1:43:32] Because everybody gets married out
[1:43:33] there.
[1:43:36] Without a revelation, they get married.
[1:43:38] Amen.
[1:43:41] But you are blessed, Simon Barjonah, for
[1:43:44] flesh and blood have not what? revealed
[1:43:48] it unto thee. But the my father which is
[1:43:52] in heaven
[1:43:54] has revealed it unto you. The revelation
[1:43:58] comes to them that are of a class of
[1:44:01] people. And I say unto thee that thou
[1:44:05] are Peter and upon what? This revelation
[1:44:10] upon this rock I will build my church. I
[1:44:15] will build the tabernacle. What are we
[1:44:18] building? We are building the tabernacle
[1:44:20] of God. What
[1:44:23] house will thou build me?
[1:44:27] According to the mind of uh the
[1:44:29] scientists out there, because the world
[1:44:32] today tells you all kind of things, you
[1:44:35] know, you can be this, you can be that.
[1:44:37] you know, churches uh that the pastors
[1:44:39] and all these things and they've
[1:44:40] deceived us and they've taken uh
[1:44:43] advantage of the people. But what do you
[1:44:45] say this is? Amen.
[1:44:49] Those things has to come so you can we
[1:44:52] can be proved and be tested. Amen. Well,
[1:44:57] the pastor said, you know, I don't like
[1:44:59] these type of people because they are
[1:45:01] less human than us. Then I'm leaving the
[1:45:03] church. Those things had to happen.
[1:45:08] to know exactly what you are. Amen.
[1:45:12] Because those weaknesses, you never knew
[1:45:15] they they were in you
[1:45:17] until that time. Oh, the the sister
[1:45:20] didn't greet me. My wife didn't cook for
[1:45:22] me. You know, I'm going to find another
[1:45:25] wife. It only showing what it was inside
[1:45:29] that you didn't know that you had.
[1:45:31] That's right. Now that the word comes
[1:45:34] and puts you to the test, now you are
[1:45:37] able not to see, oh, look at what I am.
[1:45:41] Because Jesus said, don't let them, oh,
[1:45:44] you know, at the beginning, you know,
[1:45:46] this one I don't really think is a son
[1:45:48] of God. This one I don't really think is
[1:45:50] a daughter of God. Jesus said what? Let
[1:45:52] them grow.
[1:45:54] There will be a time and this is the
[1:45:56] time at the beginning. H everybody.
[1:45:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord.
[1:46:01] The message of the hour
[1:46:04] for here we are the bride. Yeah. Jesus
[1:46:07] knows.
[1:46:11] It requires that time the pressing
[1:46:14] session. And when they put you in that
[1:46:17] pressure that's when now you start
[1:46:20] manifesting what you are. Amen.
[1:46:23] God has put me into positions too.
[1:46:27] I'll stand the you know I interpret too
[1:46:32] the the pastor say
[1:46:36] you know hey as here
[1:46:39] when we have to find a pastor we look at
[1:46:42] brother brother Martin here he's not
[1:46:44] married yet we kick him out and I have
[1:46:47] to interpret it
[1:46:52] God will prove you Amen. Amen. Will be
[1:46:57] tested.
[1:47:00] You understand that it's almost like you
[1:47:03] know your confidence pastor. You know my
[1:47:06] condition.
[1:47:08] You know,
[1:47:10] you know what's going on in my life. Yet
[1:47:12] you come on the pulpit and you you say
[1:47:15] like and I have to interpret it and the
[1:47:18] room knows that and they also they
[1:47:20] expect me to interpret it.
[1:47:24] Then it requires now the revelation
[1:47:27] about what you are doing for God at that
[1:47:30] moment. It has nothing to do with you.
[1:47:33] It's the operation of the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:36] That's right. Because I'm not putting
[1:47:38] myself in the way of the word. That's
[1:47:41] why when I come here, I preach and do
[1:47:43] these things here. I don't know what's
[1:47:45] going on with anybody's life.
[1:47:49] Many times I get that on the mountain. I
[1:47:52] didn't know even myself I was like
[1:47:54] what's going on the brother say what you
[1:47:57] say there it happened two days ago I was
[1:48:00] like oh now I understand why myself I
[1:48:02] was questioning why I went there
[1:48:06] it is the operation of the Holy Ghost
[1:48:09] and when that revelation comes forth if
[1:48:12] in the man himself doesn't understand it
[1:48:16] the prophet we see him say like when he
[1:48:18] went uh when the the second sign started
[1:48:21] he say like you know something unusual
[1:48:23] is happening. I don't know what's going
[1:48:25] on. Why? Because God himself in a
[1:48:28] yielded people he says it in the
[1:48:31] shepherd of the uh shepherd of the
[1:48:33] sheepfold. He said like you know through
[1:48:35] a yielded people he can fulfill his own
[1:48:38] will his own work.
[1:48:42] He's doing the work. It has nothing to
[1:48:44] do. So therefore then when you come to
[1:48:47] these stages you've went through thick
[1:48:50] and thin. Amen. When somebody gets
[1:48:53] offended with your messages, you you
[1:48:55] look at it a second. Yeah, it's okay.
[1:48:57] Yeah, brother Martin preached this year.
[1:48:59] Ah, it wasn't this year. Yeah, I
[1:49:01] understand. I have to carry it, but I
[1:49:04] know it's not me. But if you are also
[1:49:07] sincere, you'll see that it's not
[1:49:09] brother Martin.
[1:49:11] It's not the pastor. Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:14] You won't get offended by that because
[1:49:17] the rest of the disciples, the 70 of
[1:49:19] them, they say when he said that, you
[1:49:21] know, you have to eat my flesh and drink
[1:49:23] my blood. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:49:25] This, this is a whole another thing
[1:49:27] here. He had to press them to a corner.
[1:49:31] He had to prove us because the great
[1:49:35] mysteries that were were going to come,
[1:49:37] it was beyond their understanding.
[1:49:41] Amen. If you can stand the little
[1:49:44] struggle that you facing today,
[1:49:47] the greater things that has to come.
[1:49:49] Amen. If we can stay all night in
[1:49:52] prayer, in supplications
[1:49:55] for few hours,
[1:49:57] you expect now to live in eternity in
[1:50:00] that presence
[1:50:02] because your whole being is attracted to
[1:50:05] something else. You attracted to work.
[1:50:08] you attracted to being at home and doing
[1:50:11] your project and then being in his
[1:50:13] presence.
[1:50:16] And then that's why I said we have to
[1:50:19] pray for that revelation. Amen. It's not
[1:50:22] a revelation that you say like you know
[1:50:24] brother tell me what is your revelation
[1:50:27] God has given no no no no no God will
[1:50:30] come in you as we saw on Wednesday that
[1:50:33] the priest that goes into the holy of
[1:50:36] holies only him knows what that
[1:50:40] revelation is because it is a hidden
[1:50:42] manner it's not a public show at this
[1:50:45] stage. Amen. Oh, look at me on my long
[1:50:48] skirt. Look at me my tie and my shoes
[1:50:50] and you know I come and I pay my ties.
[1:50:52] No, that's not a public show.
[1:50:56] Because when he's dealing with you, you
[1:50:58] are pressed to the point there's no
[1:51:01] brother that can help you. There's no
[1:51:04] preacher that can help you. William
[1:51:06] Brham went through the same process
[1:51:08] himself.
[1:51:10] Baxter left him.
[1:51:14] Many brothers left him.
[1:51:19] the denominations. Then you say like you
[1:51:21] know why am I against the organizations
[1:51:23] when he tried to side with the
[1:51:25] denomination God realign him
[1:51:29] month was sitting there with ammo in his
[1:51:32] in his body. Why? Because God is pushing
[1:51:35] us to that perfect realization. And that
[1:51:39] perfect realization requires that you
[1:51:42] stay one alone with God alone. Amen.
[1:51:46] Thank you Lord. Amen.
[1:51:49] the people who are given uh this
[1:51:52] revelation but uh in Daniel chapter 10
[1:51:55] verse one and in the third year of the
[1:51:58] king Sarah of Persia a a thing was
[1:52:00] revealed unto Daniel whose whom whose
[1:52:03] name was called Belshasar and the thing
[1:52:06] was true the revelation but the time
[1:52:08] appointed was long and he understood the
[1:52:12] thing and he had understanding of the
[1:52:16] vision
[1:52:19] We ought to have the understanding of
[1:52:22] what we are doing. That revelation has
[1:52:25] to be so clear before us that you know
[1:52:29] from the death of Jesus
[1:52:33] to this day what is happening.
[1:52:36] Amen.
[1:52:37] Why am what role am I playing right now
[1:52:40] in 2025?
[1:52:44] Because when you look at the watch,
[1:52:46] every single cog has a position. It's
[1:52:50] playing a position. If you don't have
[1:52:52] the revelation of God for your life, you
[1:52:55] would be unable to play your position in
[1:52:59] this hour.
[1:53:01] Otherwise, you'll be just church
[1:53:02] attendance.
[1:53:04] You'll just be going to work. Well, I
[1:53:06] think I can make my money here.
[1:53:09] But that position but to Daniel a
[1:53:12] special group of people that revelation
[1:53:14] was so clear so perfect and he
[1:53:17] understood the vision. He understood the
[1:53:21] time how much time was remaining unto
[1:53:23] them.
[1:53:27] And uh we go verse seven we jump here
[1:53:30] quickly so that we may not spend too
[1:53:32] much time. And I and I Daniel alone was
[1:53:35] saw the vision.
[1:53:40] I alone saw the vision. For the men that
[1:53:43] were with me saw not the vision, but a
[1:53:47] great quaking fell upon them, so that
[1:53:50] they fled to hide themselves.
[1:53:55] Look at the process of receiving the
[1:53:57] revelation.
[1:53:59] Many will leave the message. We expect
[1:54:02] that to happen. Amen. Because Daniel saw
[1:54:05] the vision. He understood the vision.
[1:54:08] But then to the rest of the people,
[1:54:10] earthquake.
[1:54:12] Well, Russia is coming. Hey, hey, watch
[1:54:15] out. Hey, invest here. Do this here. All
[1:54:18] kind of earthquake moving unsettled
[1:54:20] people to about. But he said, but I
[1:54:23] alone
[1:54:25] saw the vision.
[1:54:29] We are to know if we have the vision.
[1:54:31] Amen.
[1:54:33] We are to work to have that vision.
[1:54:36] Otherwise, we're just struggling. We
[1:54:38] come to church and, you know, I I show
[1:54:41] up when I can, and
[1:54:43] I don't really understand it. Well, I
[1:54:46] you know, and that's the that's the
[1:54:49] beginning of all the issues in the
[1:54:51] church. Amen.
[1:54:54] Because the vision is not clear. We'll
[1:54:57] see what the vision is asam shows us.
[1:55:02] to show a little bit more. When Moses
[1:55:04] was born, he was a proper child. Not
[1:55:07] because he was Moses,
[1:55:09] not because we are what we are. Not
[1:55:11] because uh he Why am I praying for the
[1:55:14] sick? 54.
[1:55:17] When Mo Moses was born, he was a proper
[1:55:20] child. Not because he was Moses, not
[1:55:22] because he had done something, but
[1:55:25] because God chose him before he was
[1:55:28] born. John the Baptist 712 years before
[1:55:32] he was ever ever in his mother's womb,
[1:55:35] Isaiah saw him and said, "He is the
[1:55:37] voice of the one crying in the
[1:55:39] wilderness, prepared a way for the Lord
[1:55:42] to make it straight." God has chosen us
[1:55:44] in the same manner. 49. So it's God's
[1:55:48] sovereign grace that he has uh that uh
[1:55:52] that that he he does things. God has a
[1:55:56] church that's going to appear without
[1:55:59] without spot or wrinkle before him.
[1:56:02] Hallelujah
[1:56:04] is the chosen of God. God himself doing
[1:56:07] his own work from the very beginning the
[1:56:11] operation of the Holy Ghost. Second
[1:56:14] second requirement you have to be part
[1:56:16] of that class of people. Right? It's not
[1:56:20] your willing. God has chosen us. Amen.
[1:56:24] In Luke 2, he says, "Fear not, little
[1:56:26] flock, for it is your father's good
[1:56:29] pleasure to give you the kingdom." And
[1:56:32] in that third requirement, he will take
[1:56:34] one with prophetic insight. This vision
[1:56:38] that we are pursuing, what are we
[1:56:41] pursuing when we come to church? We must
[1:56:44] have that perfect insight before us.
[1:56:47] Brother Brham says in the church ages,
[1:56:49] the revelation of Jesus Christ, the
[1:56:51] importance of the revel of revelation by
[1:56:54] the spirit to a true believer can never
[1:56:58] be overemphasized.
[1:57:03] You hear about revelation
[1:57:06] but we cannot insist enough.
[1:57:10] We cannot call you enough regardless of
[1:57:13] how much time I can spend on the pulpit.
[1:57:16] The need of revelation in our life
[1:57:21] in a true believer you've come along
[1:57:24] this journey it is so important. It goes
[1:57:27] beyond just reading the message. Amen.
[1:57:34] You need revelation brother say more
[1:57:37] than your natural food.
[1:57:40] more than work that you go to. It is so
[1:57:45] important. Revelation means more to you
[1:57:49] than perhaps you realize. Amen.
[1:57:54] It so important to have it
[1:57:58] because by having that revelation then
[1:58:01] you are able to hear from God. Amen.
[1:58:06] Because right now it to some it can be a
[1:58:08] commandment.
[1:58:10] Yeah. But they telling us we need
[1:58:12] revelation. Yeah. They're telling us,
[1:58:13] "Yeah, brother. Yeah, I need to pray for
[1:58:15] revelation." Yeah, that's what they
[1:58:16] preach today. Yeah, we need revelation.
[1:58:19] But it goes beyond that.
[1:58:24] We can preach even ministers on the
[1:58:26] pulpit.
[1:58:29] I recall myself years I was how I I was
[1:58:33] going on a mountain alone
[1:58:36] crying before him Lord I've been in this
[1:58:39] message all my life
[1:58:44] but this revelation
[1:58:47] what is this message about I know the
[1:58:50] denomination are false I know all this
[1:58:53] year brother miss the pro I know I know
[1:58:56] I know I know
[1:58:58] But the revelation, amen, I started
[1:59:01] repenting from the time I knew that I
[1:59:03] was a human being
[1:59:06] all the way to that time. Lord, you know
[1:59:09] I've done this. You know I've done this.
[1:59:12] You know I've done this. I've taken
[1:59:14] series of messages, piled them up,
[1:59:17] reading, praying, reading, praying
[1:59:20] until that day. I'll never forget it.
[1:59:24] Until that day,
[1:59:29] I can stand and talk about this message
[1:59:31] all day long without needing a book.
[1:59:34] Why? Because it came to me. This is it
[1:59:37] here. All these years, but I've been
[1:59:39] reading this year. How come I didn't see
[1:59:41] it? Because revelation means more to you
[1:59:46] than you realize. Amen.
[1:59:51] You can with quotations today hair.
[1:59:55] Yeah. But look at the picture. Brother
[1:59:57] Bernham, you said don't you say brother
[1:59:59] Bernham was wife with with the clothing.
[2:00:02] Yeah. That's only you are comparing
[2:00:04] scripture with scripture
[2:00:07] and we can tell when it's still a
[2:00:09] struggle between Yeah. quotation here.
[2:00:12] Yeah. But but my husband allowed me to
[2:00:14] work. Oh no, my wife but my wife doesn't
[2:00:17] have to work. But in either case,
[2:00:22] it has to be first the revelation. Amen.
[2:00:28] Otherwise, it is just an impersonation.
[2:00:32] We are looking at us. Yeah, I I stay
[2:00:34] home because my husband told me, "Yeah,
[2:00:37] that's impersonation. God doesn't want
[2:00:39] it."
[2:00:42] Well, I can paint my head this way. I
[2:00:44] think like, you know, according to my
[2:00:46] own feelings. No, we saw that it has
[2:00:49] nothing. There's no sensation to it.
[2:00:54] Revelation means more to us
[2:00:58] than we may realize. Amen. And when the
[2:01:01] revelation comes,
[2:01:03] this message is no more just like you
[2:01:06] know preaching brother Brham brother
[2:01:09] but you know something has happened.
[2:01:13] Yes, I did receive the Holy Ghost. Yes,
[2:01:16] the Holy Ghost has been with me all this
[2:01:18] long journey. I'm not playing with
[2:01:21] women. I'm not cheating the word. I'm
[2:01:23] not doing this here. But that's still
[2:01:25] not revelation.
[2:01:28] Amen.
[2:01:31] Revelation.
[2:01:32] Brother Brham himself,
[2:01:35] the angel comes and tells him, I will
[2:01:39] make you now fish of men.
[2:01:42] I'll teach you on how to preach.
[2:01:45] I'll teach you on how to get that bride.
[2:01:49] But he had re he had all the patterns
[2:01:52] and things that all these years.
[2:01:56] All the quotations that I read on
[2:01:58] Wednesday 56 are backward.
[2:02:03] But then when the angel comes and meets
[2:02:05] him, he say, "I told you not to do this.
[2:02:08] I told you not to do this. Now it is
[2:02:10] time now. He said that you know I'm in
[2:02:12] anticipation like a child waiting for
[2:02:15] Christmas because something has is
[2:02:18] coming. Amen. In 62 in the contest he
[2:02:21] say God
[2:02:23] show us Jesus. Let us see Jesus and his
[2:02:26] program
[2:02:29] in 62. You see him there. He said you
[2:02:31] know the mysteries and he names all kind
[2:02:34] of mysteries and all this here until the
[2:02:37] angel came
[2:02:41] until the the word came and said yeah
[2:02:46] now the seals are open
[2:02:50] with the pattern you can still preach
[2:02:52] the word good but you're still going to
[2:02:54] be off
[2:02:58] brother Brandon preach as we all know
[2:03:01] that people run with in the message
[2:03:03] today
[2:03:07] the mighty conqueror
[2:03:09] when you read the first sermon that he
[2:03:11] preached on the right uh the sunrise
[2:03:13] service in 1955
[2:03:15] 56
[2:03:17] you read that sermon you see him he said
[2:03:19] you know now god has a work that he has
[2:03:22] to do that the world knows nothing about
[2:03:25] he comes then he follows that with the
[2:03:27] mighty conqueror he said like you know
[2:03:29] he's going to do this great work and we
[2:03:31] are in under such expectation of that
[2:03:34] work then it stops according to the
[2:03:36] pattern. Yes, it is true
[2:03:39] because after Jesus death and
[2:03:41] resurrection was the church ages
[2:03:45] he was right. But then when he comes and
[2:03:48] preaches the next one, then he find
[2:03:50] himself using the white horse rider as
[2:03:55] the Lord Jesus Christ yet with the
[2:03:58] pattern.
[2:04:02] Revelations
[2:04:03] means more to us than we can realize.
[2:04:07] That's right.
[2:04:09] We can read this message. Yes, brother.
[2:04:11] I know this message. I've read it. Yeah.
[2:04:13] But then let me insist a little bit
[2:04:16] more.
[2:04:19] Pray for that revelation.
[2:04:22] Desire that revelation, my brother.
[2:04:25] Amen. Certain things that I'm saying
[2:04:27] here, I can say it publicly. You have to
[2:04:30] pray for it.
[2:04:33] Yes. Even the prophet when he comes to
[2:04:36] preach the uh uh the seventh seal, he
[2:04:41] comes and tells them like cut this part.
[2:04:43] Don't record it
[2:04:46] because it is so important
[2:04:50] so perfect
[2:04:53] that he only needs a class of people to
[2:04:57] receive it. Amen. And that class of
[2:04:59] people is what we are.
[2:05:03] And because we are that class of people,
[2:05:06] we have to prove that we are that class
[2:05:08] of people. That's right. When we call
[2:05:11] the the preacher calls us, you are the
[2:05:14] bride. Amen. You are the bride. Amen.
[2:05:16] Brother, today the service was Amen.
[2:05:18] Amen. Amen. All around. But then now you
[2:05:22] have to get to work now to prove that
[2:05:24] you are the bride. That's right. To stay
[2:05:26] in that kitchen.
[2:05:28] to search that word. That's why when I
[2:05:31] say like you know ministry of a woman,
[2:05:34] it's not to me that physical place
[2:05:36] called the kitchen. It is a mystery
[2:05:40] and it can only come by revelation.
[2:05:44] Amen. Otherwise you I'll be fighting
[2:05:47] with the sisters here. Hey, brother
[2:05:49] Martin, I can work too. We you know
[2:05:52] brother also said hey you know I can
[2:05:54] help my husband. That's a you comparing
[2:05:57] a scripture with another.
[2:06:02] But then when that revelation come you
[2:06:05] would know like sister me
[2:06:09] Lord I'm looking for this guy I don't
[2:06:11] know I love him and say oh this year
[2:06:13] when revelation comes behold I'll send
[2:06:15] you Elijah the prophet
[2:06:17] then if she finds herself in a pathway
[2:06:21] what am I going to do now? How am I
[2:06:24] going to support his ministry? What is
[2:06:26] that onto me? What is the new stage of
[2:06:28] my ministry?
[2:06:31] I'm a young man.
[2:06:33] Excuse me.
[2:06:36] I'm a young man. I'm I'm growing up and
[2:06:39] I'm doing all these things in life
[2:06:41] without vision,
[2:06:44] without revelation
[2:06:46] because Daniel understood it.
[2:06:49] The rest that we just read it. you the
[2:06:52] rest of people will not see it.
[2:06:56] It's only given to you.
[2:07:00] And when you go into the holy of holies,
[2:07:03] you take the tablets of the law and you
[2:07:05] take the commandments of the law, then
[2:07:08] the cloud of glory has to come down.
[2:07:12] Amen.
[2:07:13] Because even Joshua after the cloud came
[2:07:17] down and Moses was not able to get into
[2:07:20] the into into the holy of holies the
[2:07:23] Bible says but Joshua stayed in there
[2:07:29] each one of us we are required that's
[2:07:33] why we read in uh on Wednesday now we
[2:07:36] have boldness to do what to go into the
[2:07:40] holy of holies
[2:07:44] It's not some random fact that you know,
[2:07:46] oh brother,
[2:07:49] brother Robert, come with me, take me
[2:07:53] all these songs and they're wonderful.
[2:07:57] It is good. But then
[2:08:00] make that experience.
[2:08:03] Get in there.
[2:08:06] You'll see a different being that you
[2:08:08] are. Amen. You'll see a whole new
[2:08:12] message that you never thought of
[2:08:13] before.
[2:08:16] It won't be a subject of debate and you
[2:08:18] know
[2:08:20] you know what do you think of that
[2:08:21] message? I don't really think so.
[2:08:24] No, it goes beyond that. Yes.
[2:08:28] Brother says, "But once the brilliance
[2:08:30] of the introduction of the church age,
[2:08:33] but once the brilliance of the seven
[2:08:34] church ages is given by divine
[2:08:37] revelation, light upon light follows
[2:08:40] until what? The whole of the revelations
[2:08:45] opens wide before our wondering eyes."
[2:08:49] Amen.
[2:08:51] You're sitting there, you're like, "How
[2:08:53] come I never seen this? It happened to
[2:08:55] me.
[2:08:58] If there's a book that I've read in the
[2:09:00] message is the church ages. If there's a
[2:09:03] book that I've dealt with the question
[2:09:05] and answers, the seven seals, I've read
[2:09:08] it over and over and over and over and
[2:09:10] over. But until that revelation came,
[2:09:14] that's right.
[2:09:17] We can compare, search scriptures, and
[2:09:19] debate along the journey we've been.
[2:09:22] That's why I say God has given me that
[2:09:24] grace to show the importance of
[2:09:25] revelation. Amen. I've been with pastors
[2:09:29] all my life. All my life. As best I can
[2:09:32] remember.
[2:09:35] Pastors here. A pastor came to me and
[2:09:38] say he comes and pulls the box of my um
[2:09:41] my books there in my room. He looks at
[2:09:43] it the divine uh the uh deity of Jesus
[2:09:45] Christ. Said you have this this what
[2:09:48] pastors you know I'm giving you my word.
[2:09:51] If I don't bring that back to you, you
[2:09:53] know, consider me a false prophet, a
[2:09:55] false pastor to this day.
[2:09:59] It only shows things by which God will
[2:10:03] take you through. Amen. To see how
[2:10:07] focused you are. God will bring, brother
[2:10:10] Bam say that he will bring even the
[2:10:13] pastor to do some big mistakes
[2:10:17] in order to see what your position will
[2:10:20] Amen.
[2:10:23] The pastor on the pulpit can one day
[2:10:25] stand up and say, "Brothers and sisters,
[2:10:29] all this message that I've preached all
[2:10:31] these years, I don't believe it anymore.
[2:10:34] What will happen to you?"
[2:10:39] That's the importance of revelation.
[2:10:42] Amen. Amen. Amen. Daddy will stay one
[2:10:45] day and say that you know her children
[2:10:47] or mama will say one day you know I've
[2:10:50] read all the messages and I've went and
[2:10:53] back and forth and there's no quotation
[2:10:55] that you will give me and all. Yeah.
[2:10:58] Daddy and mommy comp all these years
[2:11:01] compare scripture with scripture but say
[2:11:04] though it is good but revelation goes
[2:11:07] beyond that. Amen.
[2:11:11] because it it opens wide before you
[2:11:13] wondering. I said, you know, is this
[2:11:15] really at times you'll be asking
[2:11:17] yourself, you sit in the church while
[2:11:19] the word is coming forth, you'll be
[2:11:21] wondering, is everybody hearing the
[2:11:24] thing I'm hearing?
[2:11:26] Because the revelation so real. Amen.
[2:11:29] Daniel saw it. Paul on the way of the
[2:11:34] the the on his way out there he said
[2:11:36] like you know the rest of people didn't
[2:11:38] see it but he alone saw it. Amen. A
[2:11:42] class of people
[2:11:47] a specific class.
[2:11:51] Your brother can be next to you. You
[2:11:53] sleep with him in the same bed and and
[2:11:55] you share all you that you want. But
[2:11:58] then one day you said I don't believe
[2:11:59] this anymore.
[2:12:03] But to you say you are just attracted.
[2:12:05] You don't know. You don't even
[2:12:06] understand why. Because there's a seed
[2:12:09] in you. Amen. But don't just remain and
[2:12:11] say like, you know, I'm predestinated.
[2:12:13] I'm born again. No, no, no, no, no. Go
[2:12:15] on further. Amen. That's right.
[2:12:20] Because remember that some down
[2:12:22] sometimes down the road the devil will
[2:12:24] try to come and destroy you. Amen. And
[2:12:28] you have to build the defense mechanism
[2:12:31] so you can be able to face those times
[2:12:35] because if you remain the baby, you
[2:12:37] remain a baby. Yes, I'm born again. This
[2:12:39] is enough. No, it's not enough. That's
[2:12:41] right. That's right. After receiving the
[2:12:45] the the the
[2:12:47] angel tells him, I'm going to teach you.
[2:12:49] And he receive the revelation. Now we
[2:12:52] say, oh,
[2:12:54] now I can depart in peace.
[2:12:58] I don't know if I'll be able to finish
[2:13:00] everything, but I believe that's what
[2:13:03] God wanted us to to receive until the
[2:13:07] whole revelation opens right before our
[2:13:09] wandering eyes. And we edified and
[2:13:12] purified by his spirit and made ready
[2:13:15] for his glorious appearing, even our
[2:13:18] Lord and Savior, one true God Jesus
[2:13:21] Christ. I pray, listen to brother, I
[2:13:25] pray that the the blessing of God upon
[2:13:28] each reader and may illuminate by the
[2:13:32] spirit of God be each one special
[2:13:38] portion.
[2:13:42] Each one special portion.
[2:13:48] Only I will understand what happened to
[2:13:51] me. I can explain it to you. All this I
[2:13:54] was this way. I before I preached I
[2:13:57] received this uh this experience then
[2:14:00] after that he said this and then when I
[2:14:03] doubted it then it came back to me. I
[2:14:05] can explain it but until
[2:14:10] that's right you go through yourself.
[2:14:13] That's why in the vision people were
[2:14:16] going into the tent.
[2:14:19] What happened in there? No, you have to
[2:14:21] get in yourself. That's right.
[2:14:24] Each one of us, we are called while
[2:14:27] there's still time.
[2:14:30] You may be 60 years old, brother. I came
[2:14:32] to the message. Uh, you know, I wish I
[2:14:35] was like you young people. And no,
[2:14:38] Abraham called him when he was over 65
[2:14:41] years old.
[2:14:44] Yes, God can call you like uh John the
[2:14:47] Baptist when you in your mother's womb.
[2:14:49] Yes, I'm born in the message. That's
[2:14:50] good. But until you John go into the
[2:14:55] wilderness, you deal with that angel
[2:14:57] yourself. He will never make it. Amen.
[2:15:03] Can the musician come please?
[2:15:09] It required the ability to hear from
[2:15:12] God.
[2:15:14] In John 8,
[2:15:17] if God were your father, you would love
[2:15:21] me.
[2:15:22] For I proceeded forth from uh forth and
[2:15:25] God uh and came from God. Neither came I
[2:15:29] of myself, but he sent me. Why do you
[2:15:33] not understand my speech?
[2:15:37] Even because you cannot hear my word,
[2:15:41] ye are your father, the devil, and the
[2:15:44] lust of your father ye will do. He was a
[2:15:48] murderer, and from the beginning, and
[2:15:51] abode not in the truth, because there's
[2:15:55] no truth in him.
[2:15:58] When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of
[2:16:01] his own.
[2:16:03] For he is a liar and a father of it.
[2:16:07] Amen.
[2:16:08] But a special group of people,
[2:16:12] it is a whole different table.
[2:16:15] They don't speak of themselves.
[2:16:18] They only speak thus said the Lord.
[2:16:23] It's not a repetition of brother say
[2:16:25] brother say no no no no no no no you can
[2:16:28] say brother say but you are lying
[2:16:33] you can say that you know I love you
[2:16:34] brother but you are lying
[2:16:37] [Music]
[2:16:39] that's why I say like you know why can't
[2:16:41] you understand my speech
[2:16:44] why can't you hear my word
[2:16:48] because there's no truth in you amen
[2:16:51] Amen. But then once the importance of
[2:16:54] the revelation
[2:16:56] comes into our life,
[2:16:59] you know, you don't want to mix that
[2:17:01] seed with anything unpure. Amen. You
[2:17:04] know the cost of sin and what it cost
[2:17:08] the Lord God
[2:17:10] in order to redeem us from it.
[2:17:14] That's why brother preaches the cruelty
[2:17:17] of sin.
[2:17:21] You know how evil sin is to put us in
[2:17:26] this condition that one person did.
[2:17:30] And we understand the cost that one man
[2:17:33] had to pay in order to bring us back.
[2:17:37] And on this journey back, it's not an
[2:17:40] overnight journey.
[2:17:42] When you're building this tabernacle
[2:17:44] naturally, you know the hours spent and
[2:17:48] the sacrifice and and all these things
[2:17:52] and you see somebody comes and start
[2:17:54] painting doing gravity on the wall. What
[2:17:57] will be your feeling?
[2:18:01] You just clean the house.
[2:18:05] What happens when the child start
[2:18:07] running and with dust in the house? What
[2:18:10] would be your feeling?
[2:18:12] You just purchased a new car and
[2:18:14] somebody comes and rehands you. What
[2:18:17] will be your feeling?
[2:18:19] [Music]
[2:18:21] Because you know the price you pay.
[2:18:23] Amen. You know the hours you spent with
[2:18:26] the message to understand this year and
[2:18:29] a small Delila comes and takes it
[2:18:32] quickly away from you
[2:18:34] the importance
[2:18:36] of revelation
[2:18:39] because you can just like you know hey I
[2:18:41] read the message and you go you play
[2:18:42] with Delila he's stealing away from you
[2:18:46] but then when you have the understanding
[2:18:50] of what that money the times spent into
[2:18:54] investing, into working, into saving,
[2:18:58] you can't just misuse it anyhow.
[2:19:03] When you know the hours that you spend
[2:19:05] on your knees and for your children and
[2:19:07] and you let your children go and run
[2:19:09] with anybody out there, no, you can't do
[2:19:12] that.
[2:19:16] When we know how beautiful the church of
[2:19:19] God is,
[2:19:21] how important each one of us to stay in
[2:19:24] our position given to us by revelation,
[2:19:28] we can fool around.
[2:19:31] We can't come here and then start to
[2:19:33] play hypocrisy and try to show that
[2:19:37] skeleton smile. No, no, no. You want it
[2:19:40] from inside.
[2:19:42] You want when you say God bless you, it
[2:19:45] is truly a revelation of God of what is
[2:19:48] happening with my brother and my sister.
[2:19:51] When all these requests are coming on
[2:19:54] the pulpit,
[2:19:55] sense pray for me. What does it mean?
[2:19:58] They trust you. Amen. They trust us.
[2:20:03] But then if I'm not prayful, I come here
[2:20:06] and I pray for stuff. We understand that
[2:20:10] those demons will come after me, right?
[2:20:14] When you find yourself running around
[2:20:16] and left and right, it's not a random.
[2:20:20] You were in a certain meeting somewhere,
[2:20:23] that demon left somebody and came to you
[2:20:26] because you were not protected,
[2:20:29] because you were not born again, because
[2:20:31] you were not
[2:20:34] vaccinated
[2:20:36] to stand the test of time.
[2:20:39] But the Lord wants time-t tested
[2:20:41] memorials.
[2:20:43] Men who had went through it thick and
[2:20:45] thin that when they stand in front of
[2:20:49] the church, it's not just a sermon.
[2:20:52] Brother say, brother say
[2:20:56] the responsibility will only get greater
[2:20:59] over time.
[2:21:00] You pass one stage, God will give you
[2:21:03] more. Amen.
[2:21:06] I couldn't read it but says the Bible
[2:21:08] says to him that has more give him more
[2:21:13] but if you are one of uh the servants
[2:21:15] who takes his talents and goes and hide
[2:21:18] it under the the bushel it's like you
[2:21:21] know lazy servant give it to me and I go
[2:21:24] and give it to the other person you find
[2:21:27] yourself losing all interest of the
[2:21:29] world but you're trying to fake your
[2:21:31] appearance and with the outer coat Yes,
[2:21:34] the mana will fall in the outer court.
[2:21:36] You'll hear the word just like everybody
[2:21:38] else. But then that mana in the holy of
[2:21:41] holies it's a whole different testam
[2:21:44] says it will have the same test as the
[2:21:46] original mana in Pentecost. In Pentecost
[2:21:50] said when Anas and Sapphira they came
[2:21:53] down there and they were trying about
[2:21:55] lying about those things the word
[2:21:58] revealed it quickly.
[2:22:00] the importance I couldn't get to the
[2:22:03] instructions of the Holy Ghost when he
[2:22:05] comes in brotherham shows quickly to
[2:22:08] finish it say like he say look at all
[2:22:11] these mysteries that come to open
[2:22:14] the mystery that we hidden before the
[2:22:17] foundation of the world he said like you
[2:22:19] know a man like John
[2:22:22] which is the type of the bride he's able
[2:22:24] to stand out there and look at the word
[2:22:27] come open before him and he wanted to
[2:22:29] Right. Why was it forbidden? Because it
[2:22:33] was in the Holy of Holies.
[2:22:36] Though it is open today, but it's still
[2:22:39] hidden in the Holy of Holies.
[2:22:42] We can still hear the message of the
[2:22:45] hour. Brother Brham, Brother Brham, the
[2:22:47] great prophet. Yes. But until we get
[2:22:50] into the Holy of Holies, we'll never get
[2:22:52] it. Amen. Right.
[2:22:55] In all these three stages that I've
[2:22:57] shown, the outer court, the holy place,
[2:23:00] and the holy of holies, a man outside
[2:23:04] will dress like anybody else. A man in
[2:23:08] the middle will speak the of the message
[2:23:10] like anybody else. But we had to insist
[2:23:13] of the need to put aside our reasoning
[2:23:16] and all these things, conscience and
[2:23:17] memories and all this in order now for
[2:23:21] the new spirit to come in to take you
[2:23:24] into the holy of holies. Amen. Because
[2:23:27] with that whole old spirit of the badger
[2:23:31] badger's life, you'll be debating and
[2:23:34] trying to have your own ideas of the
[2:23:36] message.
[2:23:39] Then the new sp spirit when the holy
[2:23:42] spirit comes in you are ready to receive
[2:23:45] something
[2:23:47] timeested memorial
[2:23:50] walk with that message not just
[2:23:53] brotherham brotherham
[2:23:56] we just read it what does it say I pray
[2:24:01] for each one of us special portion
[2:24:06] why is it special.
[2:24:09] It's only yours.
[2:24:12] Why is that shirt special to you? Oh, I
[2:24:16] received that shirt when my dad was
[2:24:18] dying. He left me that shirt. When my m
[2:24:22] grandmother, they've received this ring
[2:24:26] for generations.
[2:24:27] You know the importance of that ring.
[2:24:30] When somebody comes and takes that ring
[2:24:32] away from you, you know,
[2:24:36] you'll put everything into action. Look
[2:24:39] at the world of politics,
[2:24:42] how they fighting to make America great
[2:24:44] again because they know the work that
[2:24:47] the forefathers did.

[2:24:54] this great revelation,
[2:24:56] it comes in, you understand, Lord, I've
[2:25:00] been in church.
[2:25:03] I'm wasting all this time fighting the
[2:25:05] ministers and criticizing them and and
[2:25:08] and my wife and all these things while
[2:25:11] there's better things to come.
[2:25:14] I can stay here.
[2:25:16] [Music]
[2:25:17] If my wife leaves me, that's fine. If my
[2:25:20] husband leaves me, that's fine.
[2:25:23] Why? Because my mind is so focused.
[2:25:26] Amen.
[2:25:28] Look into the Holy of Holies. You see
[2:25:30] that the the ark of the Lord had the
[2:25:33] cherubans looking into it. So focus
[2:25:39] angel with swift wings coming down
[2:25:41] straight focus in the word.
[2:25:45] When the rest of the angels were there
[2:25:47] standing, it said like the angel was
[2:25:49] just looking straight at me.
[2:25:52] He was the one attracting me. Why?
[2:25:54] Because he was the one who had those
[2:25:56] seals. May God bless you.
[2:26:02] Bless you, brother Martin. Amen. Let's
[2:26:04] stand this morning. This is your house.

[2:31:36] close to you. Yes.
[2:31:39] As Ruth said, Lord, I will go.
[2:31:44] Because of her decision, Father,
[2:31:48] because of the revealed word that she
[2:31:51] accepted from Naomi,
[2:31:54] it was a revelation to her, Lord, and it
[2:31:58] broke the whole curse of Moabites
[2:32:01] because of her, Lord Jesus. It's a
[2:32:04] revelation to accept this message.
[2:32:08] Lord, we have doubts. Yes, we have
[2:32:12] troubles. We have trials. Yes. But it
[2:32:15] revealed to us that it's between death
[2:32:18] and life. That this message for me is
[2:32:21] life and I will not go back.
