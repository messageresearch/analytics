Because his will is his word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation 2:es 1-7. I'm happy to be here at the house of the Lord tonight. see each and every one of you. Amen. God bless. Sister Carol and Matthew Benoy, good to have you guys here with us. God bless you. Tina Marie Shephards, good to have you back. Amen. Long time, but it's good to have you back.

Huh? &gt;&gt; No. I want to preach to people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Revelation chapter 2:es 1-7. Let me get my glasses here. And I've got to get a my bunch of books here. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we've been &gt;&gt; How many of you remember when we used to come to the pulpit when you'd have a bunch of books because you didn't have printouts back then? you know, you didn't have all that computer stuff. &gt;&gt; So, we may be here lengthy tonight. So, if so, we'll burn the midnight oil. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Revelation 2:es 1-7. Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus, right? These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks. I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear with them which are evil, and thou hast tried them which say, They are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars, hast borne, and hath patience, and for my name's sake hast labored, and hast not fainted. Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen. Repent and do the first works, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the niclatans, which I also hate. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. And to him that overcomemeth will I grant to will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Reh excuse me. 2 Timothy 3:es 1-1 17. 2 Timothy 3:es 1-17. This know also that in the last days perilous time shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof, from such turn away. For of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lust, ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now as Janice and Jabres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth. Men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. But they shall proceed no further. For their folly shall be made shall be made, excuse me, shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was. Amen. &gt;&gt; But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, persecutions, afflictions which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra. What persecutions I endured, but out of them all the Lord delivered me. &gt;&gt; We can all say amen to that because &gt;&gt; it's happened to us, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. But continue thou in things which thou hast learned, and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them, and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And the church of the living God said, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You all may be seated this evening in the presence of the Lord. Amen. Amen. This side's a little bit full over here. We got a couple pews that are kind of really lightly. I think we're going to have to move everybody from the back forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I praise the Lord for those that are here and those that aren't. We praise the Lord also because all things work together for the good. &gt;&gt; God knows why. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I'd like to uh take a thought that my wife and I have been going through in our morning devotions. We read the Bible together and then after we get done reading the Bible, then we go into the seven church age book. And I want to say that the seven church age book has really really just been such a blessing to us as we read it. We read a couple pages, but as we read, you'll find out that nearly every sentence is powerp packed. &gt;&gt; It's just so full and it's so directed. And yet, uh there are different ones throughout the message that have said uh things against the seven church age book and said that it's not brother Brandham's book because we all know that brother Lee Vale had compiled. Uh if any of you know that the seven church age book, the seven church age book is compiled from the revelation of Jesus Christ series. Here is the seven church ages preached. So what brother Brandham wanted to do was to have this condensed down and put into book form and to so that people can read it and look at the a little bit of the history of it. And so from the revelation of Jesus Christ, it took a I I don't know, I want to say about a year and a half or a couple years uh because uh Brother Brennan preaches this these sermons from December 4th, 1960. He starts uh June the 18th, goes through to June the 18th of 1961. So the seven church age book did not get printed until the late of 1965. And so he preaches this and it takes from a time of 1960 and he preaches this to 61 and then it's got to be compiled, proofread, corrected and everything and then put into a book form and then printed. And so it came out to the public in 1965. I would like to title my sermon tonight from a thought that we got from the seven church age book and I was entitled from fire unto form. And I want you to think about this because you if you allow the revival fire that is within this message to die down, you will become formal. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cold, &gt;&gt; powerless. &gt;&gt; You just have a form of godliness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it'll just be a religion. God help us. I don't want to have just a religion. Religion is a covering. So uh also I thought because it's been such a blessing to Sandy and I that I thought you know what I would like to take two Sundays a month uh of an evening service for those this is uh just for free will those who would like to come and study the seven church age book together and have some Bible study go through the seven church age book and just We probably won't even do it in the sanctuary. I don't know how many unless all of you show up. Then then we'd we'd have to come in here. But um uh we'll probably do it in the senior Sunday school room over here. And we will have a time where we just kind of have a a together time to go through Bible study and to go through the seven church age book and we have questions and answers as we go along. I love to have a running dialogue. I love to have where we sit and we read this and then I ask you a question. Well, why do you think he said that? Have you answer back and we just kind of we have a little roundhouse discussion because so much of the time the ministering of the word is one-sided &gt;&gt; from me to you and there's no uh talking back. Uh I don't want you to talk back but I just you know I'm saying no reciprocation. You see so we we have to make that clear. But anyway, uh so [clears throat] there is if I was to be given a single book that I could take with me to go anywhere in the world and you help start a church and get get people founded in the message, &gt;&gt; it would be the seven church age book. &gt;&gt; Because here within the seven church age book lies every major doctrine that he preaches. everything from the Godhead, water baptism, the history of the church, nickelan spirit, um, uh, mystery Babylon, it just goes on and on. And, uh, so, uh, anyway, it is also a book that is has been attacked, um, quite a bit throughout the the years um, and has become controversial. And I remember now this is the uh this is my personal testimony when I forget what year it was. I do have it documented. I have it on video. Um I videoed all the meetings. It was minister meetings with brother Francois Alipicard in Loausanne Switzerland. So we had ministers from all over Europe. I had brother Perry Green. I invited brother Perry to come. So he told me he was coming. And then Ewel Frank uh from uh there in uh in Germany he came also. So, we had two seasoned elders, icons of the message, and these two brethren showed up, and there was probably 35, 40 ministers throughout Europe. And uh I went ahead and videoed this. And during the course of conversation and uh the time of the meetings, brother Perry Green got up and he said something that caused all the the men to kind of gasp and he said uh well concerning the seven church age book. He said, "Brother Brennham, talk to me about burning it." And everybody went like, "Wow." And there wasn't really a lot of explanation about it and everything. And so when uh the service was done and I had uh picked brother Perry Green up at Zurich, Switzerland and brought him to the meetings and then uh every day going back and forth from the meetings uh I would pick him up from the motel and bring him to the meetings. But when we left that night, I said, "Brother Perry," I said, "You said something and you didn't elaborate on this, and I want you to tell me very, very clearly what it was that you discussed about, Brother Brennan, uh, that to burn the seven church age book." He said, well, he said, "Brother Ron, I was the first one to take up an offering to give to brother Brennham to go ahead and get this book printed and I help organize, etc., etc. And I don't remember all of the details, but he was quite involved with getting this church age book uh printed. And so I said, "Well, please tell me what was it that you talked about why perhaps the book uh should be burned?" And he said, "Uh, well, I asked Brother Brennham, you you've got now your copy of the Seven Church Age book. You've read it." And actually, Brother Brennan preferred that his daughter Rebecca actually read it to him. So he would sit, Rebecca would read it and everything. And u he made a comment to brother Perry. He says, "Well, uh he says, uh, brother Green, uh, when people read the seven church age book, there will be things in there that's a little bit more intellectual than my way of speaking." He uses words in the Seven Church Age book that Brother Brennham never says in any of all of his sermons. And I'm going to give you some examples of that so you would know. Well, brother Perry says, "Oh my, well, if you're not ex if you're not 100% happy with it, we'll burn it." &gt;&gt; Now, that's all that he he he said. And uh, of course, Brother Bram said, "No, no. Uh, you know, I took it before the Lord and after all this time and effort that's been put into it." And he said another thing and and I don't know if any of you have ever noticed this but as you go into the seven church age book and of course you got the opening page there with the title and you've got a picture of brother Brennham. Now, if you turn the page, you have the seven church ages, the seven golden candlesticks, the stars. But if you go back to and turn it back here, you'll see, and you can't write see it really from where you're at, but one of the stars from the the page behind it goes right to the center of brother Bram's forehead. So, there's a star in the center of his forehead. And brother Brandham said, "Did you notice that?" He says, "Well, brother, uh, uh, you know, uh, Brother Brandham, if if you don't like it, we'll just He said, "No, that was for a purpose." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? He said, "No, that was for a purpose." Even God lets all things work together for his good. That's right. And so anyway, um so he says, "No, I have uh even sought the Lord on this and I was told to go ahead, the Lord gave me permission to go ahead and take these books and I think if I'm I may stand corrected, the first 100 copies of the seven church age book, Brother Brenham signed each copy and gave them to ministers at first to go ahead and just give it to them. Then later when they got the the bigger shipments uh they gave them out to all the people. So uh uh I must admit that there are some things and the way they're written in the seven church age book that can cause confusion because of the way that it's formatted or the way that it's compiled. And there are several things within that uh that even as uh brother Mario and I were over there in uh Manila, Philippines, and we were talking concerning the new birth of being born again where you're a new creature in Christ Jesus. You're born a babe in Christ, water, blood, spirit. Okay? And then you grow and come to the time of adoption. Okay? Uh and uh so uh as we were kind of going over those things, one of the brothers there says, "Oh no, the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Spirit are one and the same." Brother Brandham said so. And I said, "Yes, sir. I know that seven church age book." I said, "But you got to keep reading." And it was kind of funny because the theme when we got done with our questions and answers and the time with the ministers, uh they got the idea. I said, "Keep reading." &gt;&gt; Amen. I said that's one thing about this unfolding word. I said if you look at brother Bram's message and you take it in its entirety many times he will say something uh that if it's isolated it may look like something's wrong and there may be a controversy or a contradiction. And remember whenever the Bible or the message looks like it contradicts itself there's one thing that we're lacking and that's revelation. Because Matthew 28:19, baptizing them in the name of father, son, and holy ghost and then Acts 2:38 when it's baptized in the name of Jesus Christ uh looks like it's contradicting. But the only reason that something will look contradictory is because we lack revelation. &gt;&gt; So that's what we need more than anything is revelation. So you keep reading. Now if you understand how many of you know that the unfolding of the revelation of God came to brother Brennham and kept unfolding. &gt;&gt; He said many people put a period with a certain thought or a doctrine and say God and it stops right there. He said don't do that. He said put a comma because God will add to your revelation. &gt;&gt; And so we all know and I I shared this with the the brethren there in the Philippines. I said if you all um go back and listen to the early tapes and brother Brennham in the sermon he preaches this several times called the mighty conqueror and he says we all know who that white horse rider is. It's Christ riding down through the ages. And then with the opening of the first seal he says oh my I was a 100 miles from the truth. I went back into my old notes and was started looking over what different theologians and ones had said. And of course, you all know I preached the seven uh seals in about 20 minutes way back. And he said, "I was far from the truth." And so when uh the revelation comes to him, and I've always told you this, and this is to to my church here, God circumcised this message from understanding carnal knowledge of men and brought to us the clarity of the word of God. And thus saith the Lord, &gt;&gt; he circumcised this message from 63 on with the seals. Not that 47 to 63 is bad. No. No. Because there are certain things that he teaches all the way from 47 through to 65 that is the same. He doesn't change on that. &gt;&gt; And so we thank God for those those older sermons. I love them. I I love to to listen though. And I must admit that a real revelation of this message came to me when I was over in Europe from 84 to 89 and we had started with the spoken word office and then it went to Voice of God recording and I was able to have all of the tapes. I don't know if any of you remember but you used to get some box of tapes where you'd order from Voice of God and when you paid for those they sent you another pack. Do you remember that? Well, hey, you know, working construction and and and everything, we didn't have a whole lot of money extra to be able to spend for a lot of tapes and everything, and I would be envious of of anybody that had such a large supply of tapes. And so anyway, uh we didn't have a whole lot of tapes. So when I got over there in Europe and and we got our first full complete set of tapes, I started listening to this message of the hour chronologically. Go back and let us listen to 47, 48, 49, 50, 51. And you begin to see how God is dealing with the prophet. Brother Brennan was just coming into his own understanding about his own ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is dealing with him, showing him visions and all of this stuff. And and back in uh uh the early 50s when brother Brennan preaches a sermon, I think it's 1956, what is a vision? The first time he he uh is told about there's three pulls, first, second, and third pull. And about fishing in the, you know, the the fish being caught with a little lure and then the baby shoe and all of that. Now, remember, all of those things were symbols. Yeah. And brother Brandham did not understand these things until it began to unfold to him. Okay? So when you understand that this revelation is still unfolding, &gt;&gt; you will have a great understanding yourself because you know what? God is still even though the prophet preached these things and our last tape is 1965, it's still unfolding. Why? It's unfolding in us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're catching things now that we never caught. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just give you a couple examples so that you'll get a uh a greater understanding of what I mean when intellectual wording in the seven church age book. So, in the seven church age book, I I gave some quotes to the brethren here. Um this is in the sourian church age. uh page 1442. Now let me stop and clarify something. The pages and quoting from the seven church age book from the original book doesn't line up with David Momus's because he went ahead and did his own formatting. And the reason he did his own formatting was so that there would be no copyright infringement. So even when he was told to cease and desist in in doing his books and putting them out, although it wasn't his book as he was compiling the sermons together. In fact, uh I'm so thankful that he put them in chronological order. And so if any of you have ever seen brother David Momus's book uh books and how he compiled them together. So people that want to study it, if they study just by his and page and paragraph, others that have it on the original, it doesn't line up. And so then you have to go to the quote. Well, which quote do you go to? So what I do is I study from voice of God recordings uh the table or folio views however way that you but you have it on the computer and you can look at it and even as brother Ruben Tamson had told me here a few months ago he said brother Ron uh you quoted from a sermon that brother Brandman never preached he said I I couldn't find the sermon title I said well listen I said you you have to understand many of the sermon titles that was given in the early books. And I've got some of the original um realtore tapes as an example the great harlot. If any of you have ever heard reference to the sermon called the great harlot. Well, actually that's not what he titled it. He titled it why we are not a denomination. And so uh you know it may look as though it's a little contradictory or something. knows many of the sermons. So when Joseph Brandham took over Voice of God, he corrected everything back to the original titles. He said, Brother Bram said, "Well, I'm preaching on uh tonight uh Revelation chapter 13. I'll be talking about the great harlot and everything, but the title is why I'm against organized religion." And and brother Brandham is actually identifying and I want all of you to understand this. The reason that we know that denomination is wrong is because brother Brennham takes it back to its origin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why we are not a denomination &gt;&gt; and what is wrong with those that are in denomination? Brother Bram said that is a spirit of organization. And he says, "And the devil is coming in there and he has deceived them by changing, adding to, taking away, and deviating from the word." &gt;&gt; And so I want to show you. And then also to even add a little more confusion, brother George Smith went ahead and had had the seven church age book printed again, put it in a leather bound, and then he put it in different paragraphing and paging also. So I started Sandy and I are right now in our morning devotions reading from brother George's seven church age book and Stephen McNeely was asking me brother Ron I'd like to see some of your old books that you've got all marked up and everything and I says well just open it up and you'll see uh in fact this is my original seven church age uh book and I've just got so many notes and different things in it and I wore it out and pages started falling apart that brother Wes Nygard and some brethren uh when we were back on the church in Maryland, they went ahead and said, "Brother Ron, I see your seven church age book is falling apart." And they had it rebound for me and even put my name on it. And so, uh, instead of having to use the one that I had all marked up, I started going through another one of the seven churches book and now I'm marking it all up, right? And uh it's just amazing how much you glean &gt;&gt; from this when you take your time and you look at it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. I tell you what, for brother Brennham having a seventh grade education, the knowledge that he had of the word of God is is astounding. Anyway to show you an example of uh we talk about in intellectual wording that brother Bram said well when people will look at this they will see that you know I I I don't preach like this as an example smrnian church age uh paragraph 144. Yeah there we go. Um now before we leave this subject I want to make myself very clear on what is the ba baptism of the holy ghost is according to the word it is not according to me it's not according to you it's according to thus sayaith the lord or we are falsely led understand that brother said false prophets bring false births &gt;&gt; they birth you to a sensation or to an emotion but not to the word that's That's why brother Bram said, "Look, I'm taking you a a prophet of God always takes you back to the word of God, back to thus sayeth the Lord." Okay, let's read on. To begin with, you'll notice that in my meetings when I have finished preaching an evangelistic service or some teaching message, I cast a netit and invite a response from the people. I ask them to come forward and receive the Holy Spirit. My Pentecostal friends upon hearing me say this believe that I'm on I'm I'm inviting people to come forward to be baptized with the Holy Ghost because they're already born again. So when I invite those who are spirit uh led filled excuse spiritfilled to come and deal with those who have answered the invitation to receive the spirit. These dear ones surge forward and deal with the people in such a manner as to encourage them to yield to God and believe to speak in tongues. Now hang on there a second. Brother Brennham is having to correct the people even within his own congregation. He says why? Because they came out of that denomination but didn't some of them brought their old denominational thinking and understanding with them. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they would say, "Okay, we're you're inviting people to come forward and we're going to pray for them until they speak in tongues." This has caused a great deal of confusion. And I want to tell you exactly what I mean. I mean for the sinner to come forward and to be born again, which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost, which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched. In other words, to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost. It is one and the same. Now, if you stop there, that's confusing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. And this is where the brother in the Philippines, oh, Brother Bram said, "It's one and the same." I said, "Yes, sir, but keep reading." So, let's just keep reading. Now, I realize it's going to be confusing for a moment here as most people know that I was ordained a Baptist preacher and I have steadfastly declared that the Baptists have missed it for saying you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe for that is not so. You receive him since you believe. Acts 19:es 2-6, he said unto them, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe?" And they said unto him, um, we have not so much as heard whether there be any in Holy Ghost. He said unto them, unto what were you baptized? And they said, unto John's baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come here after him, that is on Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. When Paul laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came upon them and they spake with tongues and prophesied. There it is. Paul said, "Have you received since, not when you believe?" There is a great difference there. For it is after we believe that we receive. Ephesians 1:13 is an exact word repeat of what happened at Ephesus according to Acts 19. in whom you also trusted after. Now, Brother Brandon, capitalize that after there, that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also after that you believe, not when you believe, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise. Now, here is my point. Too many of our modernists and even our fundamentalists so-called believe under salvation at a certain specific time in many cases is making a decision and that has been called receiving Christ or being born again. Now again here if you stop at certain quotes you're going to get confused. &gt;&gt; Now to receive Christ is to receive his spirit. To receive his spirit is to be born again. to receive his spirit is to be baptized with the Holy Ghost. Amen. These folks believe. Hey, these folks believe. He's quoting them. Do you understand? It's how you read it, man. Any of you that went to school and you had to go through and look at your studies, you have to know how this man's writing and what he's referring to. Okay, that is wonderful. BUT THEY STOP THERE. YOU RECEIVE the Holy Ghost after you believe. It's always been that way and always will be. The very first word of direction to the people was by Peter at Pentecost. Repent. Be baptized every one of you in the name of Christ. uh uh Jesus Christ. So listen, that is not the prophet's doctrinal teaching. If you were to take those quotes, look, he said it, seven church age book, one and the same, Holy Spirit, new birth, and then he repeats it again just a few verses later. And again, that has caused such confusion because people stop there. And as I told those brethren, keep reading. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That didn't stump me. I was so glad and I thank God. I I believe that we should have the message in our heart, not in our heads. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. That listen, pretty soon, you know, brother Brennham's doctrinal teaching and a certain quote when somebody say says something like that doesn't stump you. I said, "Yes, sir. You're exactly right. Seven church age book." I said, 'If we had the book here right now, I said, 'I'd read it for you. I says, Brother Ram said, that's what these people believe. Here are the modernists and the fundamentals. This is what they believe. Now, let me tell you what I believe. Okay? I said, you just got to keep reading. So you have to understand that some message preachers are trying to prove their personal doctrinal teachings by bringing their former teaching from Pentecost even into this message. &gt;&gt; And so what they do is they start influencing the people of what they believe is the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And now we're trying to bring to the people's understanding some kind of evidence. Now the reason that Pentecost early Pentecost when we talk about uh 1906 Pentecost not Acts 238 but when the Holy Spirit came down Acts uh excuse me of Pentecost 1906 uh it was the Holy Spirit coming down and activating gifts and my it was it was a wild movement that went very very quickly and swept through the people and people were just it was a real revival. And brother Brennham said, "Now listen," he said, "watch, if we if this same thing were to continue on," he said, "50 years, they would be further away from the truth than it it took the Catholic Church 2,000 years." &gt;&gt; And you think, "Well, how can that be?" When you think about Ephesus, when Sandy and I have been reading, and it starts out in the book of Ephesians, what's wrong with the Ephesian church? The Ephesian church had the most people that witnessed either the disciples and them preaching or got to hear and see the ministry of Christ himself. Got to experience the upper room experience. They were moved on by God. And just a few later, few years later, God has to diagnose them and say, "You've left your first love." How could you do it? How could you let these false preachers and different ones come in here and take you all already away from your first love? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My Okay, so let's go. I'm going to go to another one. Page 164. of this original seven church age book. He says, and I didn't give this to the brethren here just because I knew it'd be too much reading. Now, uh remember now John the Baptist was both prophet and messenger of his day. He was filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother's womb. When he was baptizing in Jordan, the word of God Jesus came to him. The word always comes through the spirit filled. That is the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost. Now, this is amazing because brother Brenammy uses the word the evidence of the Holy Ghost about eight or 10 times here in the next two or three pages. You want to know what the evidence of the Holy Ghost is? He tells you, &gt;&gt; "Keep reading." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's say that together. Keep reading. even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive. He says, I want you to note very carefully that Jesus did not say that the evidence being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues or interpreting, prophesying or shouting and dancing. He said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth. You would be in the word for your age. Evidence has to do with receiving the word. &gt;&gt; Evidence has to do with receiving the word. How many of you can say, "I've received it." Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's evidence God's dealing with you. Let's keep reading. &gt;&gt; What came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only? The evidence of a spiritfilled Christian believer is not to produce the truth word, but to receive the word and believe it and obey it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The time of of all of these debating and different things. It's over. &gt;&gt; I I don't want to debate the word. I don't mind sitting down questions and answers. I think, saints of God, what we have come to in this age is the maturity. We're not debating the word anymore. Come, let us reason together. You come with the right attitude because if you're not careful, you've got your idea and his idea and all you're trying to do is prove your point, not listening to his point. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, um, again, here's another example of some intellectualism put into the seven church age book that he uses certain words that he never in 1100 sermons never uses the words. So, they're kind of intellectual words. Here it is. Sardisian church age page 254. If there was a time of denominational zeal, it was at this tragic time. The words of Cornelius describe much of this area. Comminius, I'm sorry, Comminius wrote the one thing needful. He compares the world to a labyrinth. What's a labyrinth, Jonathan? Come on, Google it. &gt;&gt; Hey, Siri, what is the labyrinth? &gt;&gt; Or how do you say it? &gt;&gt; Labyrinth. What's a labyrinth? Google, hey, put it in your index of the messages. He He never uses the word. Never. and 1100 sermons and shows the way out by leaving what is needless and choosing the one thing needful Christ. He goes on and now to the next out of the Bible they they forg their different creeds. These are their fortresses and bull works. Bull works. Brother Brenham in 1100 sermons never uses the name bull works behind which they entrench themselves and resist all attacks. Now just a paragraph below that Satan is the greatest sopist 1100 sermons brother Rem never uses the word sopist. You know what a sophist is? Somebody who loves to debate. Any of you ever have debate in high school where you're on a debate team and they give you a subject and they say, "Okay, you be the you um we're just going to have you go on this side for let's say abortion and you're against abortion. Let's just have a debate on it just off the cuff and you have to debate one another over a certain subject." Well, Satan is the world's greatest sophist. &gt;&gt; He's a big debater. But type that in your message church. You'll he never says it in 1100 sermons. So there's where brother Brennan had told Perry Green. He said, "Brother Perry, some of these words and stuff, they'll see it. It's kind of intellectual." Okay. And so anyway, I just wanted to show you some of those things to kind of give you an example of why Brother Bram said, "Well, when some of the people read that book, they'll see that someone with a seventh grade education doesn't come up." And I've never spoke like those words. Okay, understand that. And I love that. And I love Brother Brandham's uneducated way. &gt;&gt; Amen. as one brother had told me there uh in uh he was a professor of English at ex uh university and he said brother Brennham butchered the king the queen's English. I said yeah he sure did &gt;&gt; go &gt;&gt; he he butchered it. I said but he butchered it so nicely. &gt;&gt; And I said but he didn't speak the queen's English. He spoke the king's English. &gt;&gt; Now you see in Acts 4:13 the Bible says, "And when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men. God does not need your human ability." These were ignorant and unlearned men. Peter could not even write his name. They marveled and took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you there's one thing about brother Brennham in his uneducated way. And he says, you know, I I just felt so bad because here I am with such I have no education. And he felt bad standing around all these men with their DHDs and all of this stuff. And he says, "And I I just say hate and taint and fetch and tote and and everything." And God said, "I'm going to be with you." &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I love the way that Brother Bram preaches. &gt;&gt; I do. I I I love and how he even makes up words. &gt;&gt; You know, many times when he first refers to being born again, he says, "Born." B O R N E D. born again. Huh? He many times he says he he mixes words and he makes up his own words. &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what, I love it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And um so anyway, it wasn't because of intellectual learning. &gt;&gt; What attracted us to to the prophet's message was because he made this Bible become alive. &gt;&gt; He took the mysteries of this and opened it up. everything from something so simple as water baptism. And I remember the first time I heard brother Brandon preach serpent seed. He said it wasn't an apple. He said apples do not produce children. He said why if so we ought to pass it or to that show people are naked we ought to need to pass the apples again. Right? &gt;&gt; And then he says no it was a sex act. And I thought, what? Yeah. Look forth brought forth children. Are you not the fruit of your mother's womb on? And I thought, why didn't I think of that? It was so simple. It's like they just kind of slaps you in the forehead and you thought, why didn't I think of that? Why? Because you're not a messenger. &gt;&gt; No, God sent unto the messenger to the church of Lae the mystery of these things. In fact, brother Brennham had not one particular mystery that he had given him except for the FACT HE TOOK ALL OF THE LOOSE ends that the others went and they probed at. And if you have ever read Clarence Larkin's dispensational truths, there is some fantastic things in there. &gt;&gt; In fact, brother Brandon read it quite thoroughly. um they probed at it. But one thing that the prophet of God did is that he opened us the the seven seals. &gt;&gt; And some have gone so far as to say only six seals because the seventh seal hasn't been revealed. And and now there even is a doctrine going around that there's two sets of seals, one on the inside, one on the backside, and on and so now really what's going on now is there's the revealing of the second set of seals and Hey, listen. Find me a quote where he said there's two sets of seals. No, it's hidden within, written within, and on the backside sealed with seven seals. So, I researched that uh throughout today, and I found out, hey, there is no two sets of seals, one set of seals. Brother Brennan was trying with carnal understanding to to to figure this all out. But when it his eyes were open to it, then the revelation of the seven seals came to him. And the seventh seal, let's make it quite simple. What is it? Seventh seal is Revelations 10:1-7. It's the coming of the Lord. It's the ministry of this end time. &gt;&gt; And now we know what is it? It's his coming. &gt;&gt; It's the coming of the Lord. It's getting ready. It's a shout, a voice, a trumpet. All of this has to do with the coming of the Lord. We know what the seventh seal is. It's his coming. Thank God. And we now we understand what that is. But he said there was two parts that I understood. But that last part was in an unknown tongue. And he says, I believe that will be revealed right at the time. &gt;&gt; So he said, don't try to figure it out. Don't try to spiritualize everything. Let it go. He said in questions and answers between the sixth and seventh seal, he said, now I know you're not catching it. You're not supposed to catch it right now. He said, "But whatever you do," and I think I've shown you in a study series where Brother Bram says three to five times, "Do not interpret this. Just leave it alone. God is his own interpreter." And you don't have to try to figure it all out. You don't have to put it all together. In fact, God is his own interpreter. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me give you one more example of some intellectual teaching from the seven church age book that is definitely you'll not find in brother Brandham's 1100 sermons. This Ephesian church age page 77 the order of temple service is also very revealing. There were first of all priests who were unix there are sterile priesthood pre-aged or preaged I don't even know how to say it the sterility of people who would drift from the word for a people who claim to know God apart from the word are barren of life as a sterile unit. Well, when you when you go to reading this, this is not how brother Brennham spoke the sterility of preceded. Oh, where'd he get this? So, Lee Vale went ahead because he was a doctor of divinity. He, you know, and he always called him Dr. Leeville. I had one brother said, "Yeah, I tell you a witch doctor is what he was." I said, "Oh, man. Come on. Quit. Why? Why do you got to throw uh stones at people, you know? And um brother Brennham loved brother veil. He did. He was thankful that brother Veil went ahead and helped him compile this. That was a great work. Now what can this mean but the day would come when the vested clergy by political maneuvering, state help and substitution of the word and spirit for creeds and dogmas and human leadership would enslave the lady until the late the leaders luxuriated in illgotten wealth and enjoyed their filthy uh pleasures and the poor people who were to be served according to God now became the servants. You see the these are these are how brother Brandham told brother Green this is not the way I connect this that's not my verbiage it's not how I say things brother Brandon was a typologist and so brother Brandon would look back in the Old Testament and see what God did back there and he says I can tell you what's going to happen now because what happened then because he said history keeps repeating itself And so he would call it types and shadows. He says, "As it was in the first Exodus, so shall it happen again." And he said, "With a prophetic leader, and as Janice and Jambre, and as Dayathan and Kora, and as Joshua raised up, and Caleb, and so on and so forth, brother Brennham always looked at the types and shadows." So, [clears throat] uh, I wanted to just share with you some of these things here tonight. And I know this was nothing big and and and great and everything. And quite honestly, last night I I I couldn't I couldn't sleep. I went to bed about 9:30, 10 o'clock, woke up at 1, and I just had I'm having a hard time sleeping right now. So, um, I'm a little bit tired. and tried putting something together tonight and everything. And uh when I shared this with Sandy and I, the thing her and I as we were reading this from the seven church age book and I said, I'm going to preach about from fire to form. If we're not careful and we allow this fire that's burning within us, this revival to burn down to nothing but a couple embers. &gt;&gt; What we will become is form and we will have a form of godliness. &gt;&gt; And I've always said, Lord, don't let me do that. &gt;&gt; Don't don't let me become some kind of lukewarm believer. Let me be on fire for you. Let me love you God with a ferancy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; I appreciate you all so much and thank you for coming tonight. And uh uh I thought showing you some of these things of what brother Rim said in the seven church age book that those quotes on that the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is one and the same. If you keep reading, Brother Bram said, "Now I will tell you what I believe is." He said, "Not what the modernists say, not what they say, not what my Pentecostal friends say." So then, Brother Brennham, the next three to five pages, he explains it, but it was so good. It wasn't not right, Brother Mario, when we had the the ministers meeting and it didn't fluster me, brother. He he really was quite adamant. No, what you're saying that is not what brother I said brother keep reading. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said if we had the seven church age book here I says we just open it up and I show you right there where brother Brennham I said go look up the words modernists and fundamentalists. I said you'll come right up with this quote and I said uh he said that's what they say. But you see, if you read it and you stop there, you can come up with some kind of mysterious doctrine and bring it over from former teaching right on into this this hour that we're in right now. And saints of God, I am a firm believer we do not have to manufacture anything. &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; We don't have to work anything up. We don't have to get sensational. We don't have to get emotional. Uh, brother Brennham many times he uses the word fantastics. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Instead of fanatical. &gt;&gt; He said all of these fantastics that are going on and emotions and sensations. There's an example of he used the wrong word and everything. But if you understand what he was meaning to say, &gt;&gt; fanatical and fantastic. And one of the things that he said about with Luther, he said, you know, Luther contested the Catholic Church and he says the main thing that was most astounding was not that he contested the Catholic Church, but he kept his head above the fanaticism that followed his own ministry. Isn't that amazing? the fanaticism that and he says those that started the Protestant movement to protest the Catholic Church, they started going out and burning churches and killing people. He said this is not where we're to do or to just just say the just shall live by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. So much of the time people want to manufacture something &gt;&gt; and this is not a time where we have to say we need to go back to no Pentecost. Pentecost is an experience &gt;&gt; and you all of you have got to have your own Pentecostal experience. That is a time wherein you have your Pentecost with God, your jubilee, your releasing, God giving you &gt;&gt; his own life. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to manufacture anything. When I look at the life of Abraham, musicians, if you come, I'm closing. When you look at the life of Abraham, you see 25 years before he was given the promise. He's going to have a promise seed. He's gonna have a son. And brother Brennham reenacts it. In fact, I heard it last night as I was listening to a tape. He said, "Sarah, do you feel any different?" "Nope." "Week later." "How about it, Sarah? You feel any different?" "Nope." "How?" He said, "About nine months later, don't you feel anything?" Nope. About 10 years goes by. Nope. 15, 20, 25. Nope. And he says, "And Abraham rejoiced within himself." He says, "Praise God. It's going to be a greater miracle &gt;&gt; now than ever before." Because he was as good as dead and so was his wife. And it wasn't something that he had to work up. In fact, when he listened to his wife through carnal understanding to go into Hagar, it brought forth an Ishmael. If Ishmael was the seed of Abraham, the right seed in the wrong woman church will bring forth an Ishmael every time. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? Amen. &gt;&gt; The right seed &gt;&gt; in the wrong church woman will bring forth an Ishmael. And Ishmael persecuted the elect. &gt;&gt; That's why he says bride will not persecute bride. &gt;&gt; No. Hey, we might disagree. In fact, when we had with the the minister meetings over there, when we had the the banquet, I shared with them the quote where Brother Bram said, "Some say he's coming on a white horse, others say he's coming on a white cloud." He goes, "What difference does it make as long as we agree he's coming?" &gt;&gt; Amen. I said, "Some of us have built our little doctrinal walls because we see it a certain way and somebody else sees it another way. That shouldn't stop our fellowship. In fact, the only way we can have true fellowship one with another is just say what he said. Not interpret what he said. Say what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we have to agree. That's why he said, "Say what I say on those tapes. give back. That's why all of the believers that knew me from way way back there, even those over in Europe, I used to use this terminology all the time. You do your homework. I'd say you get into these messages. You listen to these tapes. each one of you, and I say this to all of my young men, young girls, and everything. If you don't have a seven church age book that is yours, you get one. We'll make sure you get your own seven church age book. Have your own seals. Do any of you know what the COOD book stands for? Cood. What is this? &gt;&gt; Conduct. &gt;&gt; Order and doctrine. &gt;&gt; Order and doctrine. What is the cood books? It's questions and answers all the way through. And there are so many answers to so many questions even that are coming up today and they don't even read. Keep reading. And did you know in your cood book, you can go back there in the back and you want to look at see what brother Brent says about uh foolish virgin or tribulation, you go back and it tells you go back and read the questions and then he gives the answers. &gt;&gt; And so I tell all of you do your homework so that you go and you study these things. Get into it just like your Bible. Don't read it one time and that's it and close it up. This Bible keeps unfolding and every time I read it, I see something new and I say I I say, "Father, about the time I think I really am catching a good grasp and I kind of know something, you open another door, then I realize I don't know nothing." &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't put a period, put a comma and keep reading. Do your homework, saints. Most of all, pray for the pray for the ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. I never take it lightly to get behind this pulpit. I never do. I realize God will hold me responsible. He will not hold you responsible for me, but he'll hold me responsible for you. I've got to tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. God, help us that we hold on to everything that is true &gt;&gt; and say all that he said. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; Keep me true, Lord. Keep me [singing] true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. &gt;&gt; Keep me true, Lord [singing] Jesus. [music] Keep me [singing] true. There's a race [singing] [music] that I must run. &gt;&gt; There are victories to be [singing] won. Give me [music] power, every hour [singing] to be true. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like to ask a question before we close the service. Is there anyone here that would be interested in having a Bible study and going through the seven church age book and do it about two times a month on the Sunday evening? Would you be interested if if I said we'll do it and I make a commitment? Would you come and be here with us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have a time. Hey, listen. I've been rejoicing. And brother Renham says, let me quote you. He says, "You can't understand the opening of the seals until you get the foundation of the seven church ages." And he said, "Like a mighty burst of illumination that comes forth from a Roman candle." He said, "There illumination after illumination is coming [music] forth and there before our wondering eyes." So when we get the foundation of the seven church ages and what he did in the Ephesian church age, he said what he starts in Ephesus, he goes to through to Thitara and keeps going all the way down to Laudia because what God starts, he keeps it going. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we see then we see in every church age what they have to overcome. how the enemy comes in and tries to dissuade them, discourage, get people disappointed and and and go away from the truth. And so we see these patterns and these cycles and how that brother Bram said, "Watch at by the time the fourth generation," he said, "the's just a few embers left of that original flame." Okay? We've got ones like brother Bobby and brother Paul that saw brother Brenham was in meetings heard him perhaps shook his hand that's first generation I'm second generation can I come he's already brother Brandham's already gone passed off the scene so I'm second generation my kids Amos you're third generation Malachi you're fourth What will this message be like if you have kids? You get married and you have kids. Will there be the holding the same standard? What will there be any resemblance of what the original message was like? Will there be any more holiness? What will things be like? How will they preach? What will they do? Oh God, one thing about a fire, all of you have gone camping. All of you love to go camping. You go every time you you can and that's fine. But you have a fire. There's something about a campfire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They sit around the fire and a lot of times you don't have to say much. Everybody just sits and looks at the fire. Wow. Because God is fire. Our God is likened unto a consuming fire. So there's something about fire that's intriguing. &gt;&gt; But if you sit there and you have this nice fire, what happens if you don't keep feeding it? It just dies and goes out. &gt;&gt; What about this fiery experience that you've got with God? If you don't fuel the fire, that's a good sermon. &gt;&gt; If you don't fuel it, it'll go out. If you don't obey it, he said, I'll take that candlestick from you. &gt;&gt; Oh, God, help us &gt;&gt; in this hour. &gt;&gt; To keep this. I say, Lord, here I am in latter stages of my life. Don't let this revival fire die. &gt;&gt; Help me to pass it on to others &gt;&gt; because it only takes a spark to get a fire going. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Thank you for coming [music] tonight. God bless you. So, the Lord willing, I looked at my schedule. November and December is really full. I won't be able to do it, but starting the new year, we will try to do two Sundays a month. and we'll do it every other week. And we'll do it Sunday afternoon, Sunday evening, let's say, and we'll get together and we'll meet over here in the senior Sunday school room. And I will see what the attendance will be like the first time that we have it to see if I have to move it in here because I would rather have it in there because I'm not afraid of a small group. In fact, I kind of like smaller groups because they're a little bit more intimate. You can talk to them a little bit more. get a large group. It's hard to I I like, you know, so but I want to see if you're really interested, if you really want to do it, you want to have Bible study, we we sit down, we go through this and we dissect it &gt;&gt; because why do we believe what we believe? &gt;&gt; It all comes back to this. &gt;&gt; A prophet will never bring you something, but what he brings you right back to this. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why this is our absolute Amen. Thank God for that. Amen. God bless you. We'll sing this song another time. And I I trust that all of you tonight, No, I didn't really preach. I just kind of read some quotes and we we just visited. There are times my voice is a little bit gone right now. I needed to relax a little bit, just talk to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are times, &gt;&gt; brother Mark, when you sit down with your kids, you talk to them, &gt;&gt; huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just have a mom and dad time and sit down and visit with them. Hey kids, how you doing? &gt;&gt; And just visit with them. So, God bless you. Thank you for being here. God bless you each and everyone. I'll not ramble on anymore. God bless you, brother Mark. Go ahead and sing this. I'm going to try to I need one of these young boys. Malachi, come here. Grab these books here for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You be my messenger. You be my forerunner. Come on, Mal. Let's go to my [music] office. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. Keep me true, Lord [music and singing] Jesus. Keep be true. There's a race [music] that I [singing] must run. And there are victories to be won. [singing] Give me power every hour to be. Sing it one more time. Oh, keep me true, [singing] Lord Jesus. [music] Keep me true. Keep me true, Lord Jesus. Keep me true. [music] There's a race that I must run and there are victories to be won. [music and singing] Give me power every hour to be. I'm amazed that you love me. I'm amazed [singing] that you [music] love me. Oh, I'm amazed how you care. Through your preious blood. I [music] found pardon. And all my sins are [singing] washed. They're all washed away. [music] All my sins are washed. Let's sing it again. Oh, I'm amazed that [music] you love me. Oh, I'm amazed how you care. Through your precious blood. I found pardon. And [music and singing] all my sins are washed. They're all [music and singing] washed away. All my sins are washed. [music and singing] Let's sing it one more time. Yes, I'm amazed that you love me. Oh, I'm amazed how you care. Through your preious blood. I found pardon. All my sins are [singing] washed. They're all washed away. All my sins are washed [music] away. [singing] Amen. Brother Ezra, would you come and close our service in a word of prayer? Just a reminder, family night on Friday, 5:30, and then our lunchon on Sunday. If you haven't signed up, please do so. Amen. Brother, let's just pray. Lord Jesus, Father, we're indeed grateful, Lord, to be in your house, Lord, to sit around the fire of the word of God and to remember those things that would have been taught us by a prophet of God, Lord, that was vindicated by our [music] pillar of fire. Lord, we thank you for a pastor that will take time to dissect the word of God so that we can understand it, Father. Lord, you've opened the word to our hearts. Lord, may we receive it into our lives. Lord, that we can live an over andcoming life, Lord, that we're set aside from the world and the things of this life. Oh God, bring us back safely, Lord, in these season of your coming. Father, we ask you'd strengthen our pastor. [music] Strengthen the sick among us. Oh God, we still believe you're a healer. You're the same yesterday, today, and forever. Oh God, bless your people. Strengthen them and protect them in Jesus' name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When you're walking through the valley and there are shadows all [singing] around, do not fear for God will guide you and he will keep [music] you safe and sound. For he has promised to never leave you nor forsake you. And his word is true. God is good all the time. He put a song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time. Through the darkest [music] night, his light will shine. God is good. Oh, God is good. All the time and we were sinners, so unworthy. Yet for us, he [music] chose to die. He filled us with his holy spirit. Now we can stand and testify. [music] That is love is everlasting. And his mercies they will never [singing] end. God is good all the time. He put a song of praise in this [music] heart of mine. Oh, God is good all the time. [music and singing] Through the darkest night, his light will shine. For God is good. Oh, God is good. Sing the chorus again. Oh, God is good all the time. He put a song [music and singing] of praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time. Through the darkest [music] night, his light will shine for God is good. Oh, God is good. Our God is good. Our God is good all the time. God is good all the time. Go in [cheering] Jesus name. You are dismissed. Amen. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Jack. Hey.
