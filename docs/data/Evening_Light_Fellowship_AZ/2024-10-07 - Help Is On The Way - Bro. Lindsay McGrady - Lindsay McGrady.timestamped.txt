[19:14] back working the overhead because me and
[19:17] the Lord had a wrestling match this
[19:19] morning I sent them my notes last night
[19:23] and I know if I did it the Lord was
[19:25] going to probably change it and he did
[19:27] so Brothers just just SC wrap it put it
[19:29] all just all over in File 13 we're going
[19:32] a different direction and listen I know
[19:35] I've learned if you're going to wrestle
[19:37] the Lord he's going to
[19:39] win and it's always for the best right
[19:41] you know I'm like but Lord I I hadn't
[19:43] prepared this I'm not ready with this it
[19:45] don't matter he does the work anyway if
[19:48] I'm trying to do it it'll never get done
[19:50] right it will it'll never happen but he
[19:52] does it praise God so while you're
[19:54] standing just turn with me over to the
[19:55] Book of Daniel the 10th chapter
[19:59] and I count it an honor and a privilege
[20:02] to be here with you this
[20:05] morning with the Believers I love the
[20:08] presence of the Lord every time I walk
[20:10] in here it's just a A Little Piece of
[20:13] Heaven and uh it is it just it's a
[20:17] blessing to me and listen I can sit in
[20:20] the congregation and be just as blessed
[20:22] probably more
[20:24] blessed than than being up here and and
[20:29] uh but you know we we submit to the Lord
[20:31] whatever the Lord
[20:32] desires uh I apologize to those of you

[23:50] of the Lord I I I want to do something
[23:51] brother Ron didn't ask me to do this but
[23:54] I I know as we were at the marriage
[23:56] banquet uh the other night everybody IAL
[23:58] talked to knowing you know that we were
[24:00] from North Carolina the mountains of
[24:01] North Carolina they were asking me about
[24:03] you know the storm and so forth so I say
[24:06] this so that when I walk out of the pull
[24:08] pit and I see you outside I don't have
[24:10] to tell you I don't have to say the same
[24:12] thing you know 20 times again but uh you
[24:16] know the Lord really blessed us yeah we
[24:17] were in the very northwest corner of of
[24:20] North Carolina right where Virginia
[24:22] Tennessee in North Carolina come
[24:23] together up in the mountains and uh you
[24:26] know we we saw the hurricane we we knew
[24:29] that it was coming we had been warned
[24:31] that there was going to be some flash
[24:33] flooding but you know I really didn't
[24:35] understand the word flash flooding I
[24:37] really didn't think about it uh until
[24:40] now and now I have a a little bit of a
[24:43] better understanding of flash flooding
[24:46] and and it started raining I guess
[24:48] approximately
[24:49] Tuesday and it just rained constantly
[24:53] there and the ground it was raining hard
[24:55] but the ground was saturated and we're
[24:57] in the Hills and it's all heels and it
[24:59] runs off and uh I guess it was Thursday
[25:03] night F early Friday morning it really
[25:05] started raining it really hit and
[25:07] started raining really hard and the wind
[25:08] started blowing and and we really got
[25:11] the brunt of the Storm at that point and
[25:14] uh I went down early that morning we
[25:16] lived close to the river we're up on the
[25:18] hill but Liv close to River and I went
[25:19] down to see where's the river at you
[25:21] know is it in the road well I got out it
[25:24] was in the road it was over the bridges
[25:26] I turn around back to the house I listen
[25:27] to radio and they he said 5,000 people
[25:29] are houses without power and and we're a
[25:32] small County I think there's maybe
[25:34] 27,000 people in the entire County that
[25:37] we live in and then the next thing I
[25:39] hear it's 7,000 know it's going up we
[25:41] still had power and I thought well our
[25:43] eldest son he's got a basement it's
[25:45] totally submerged he's got a a sump pump
[25:49] and it's pump out the water as long as
[25:51] he's got electricity but so I told
[25:53] Sharon said I'm going to run over to my
[25:55] mom she's got a dad had a generator
[25:57] hadn't been started probably in 5 years
[25:59] if I can get it started I'll take it to
[26:00] Seth house and so we headed out that way
[26:02] and I took a gallon of gasoline got to
[26:04] Mom's
[26:06] house the little generator started right
[26:08] up loaded it up took it to my son's
[26:10] house about 10 minutes away and I asked
[26:13] him I unloaded it you know I said hey
[26:15] Seth you got any gasoline he said not
[26:18] really I was like okay this thing's not
[26:21] going to last very long in a gallon of
[26:23] gas so I got his gas can and I I I took
[26:26] off down the store there's a little
[26:28] convenience store maybe a mile or so
[26:30] from his house when I got there we just
[26:32] passed it when I got
[26:36] there off and I said oh okay so then I
[26:39] headed more into town all the light we
[26:41] just come through there all the lights
[26:42] are out it's dark so I headed back over
[26:45] toward my mom because there's three gas
[26:46] stations there get over there it's all
[26:49] dark and and I noticed then at the road
[26:52] he goes right out to my mom's house I
[26:53] looked out I turned around and the the
[26:55] creek that comes through it already
[26:57] covered the road and and so forth I was
[26:59] like oh no going to Mom's house I can't
[27:02] get to her house she was safe she wasn't
[27:05] in in any danger whatsoever but U you
[27:09] know I thought wow so I thought
[27:11] everything's closed I so I went back to
[27:12] my house 5 miles away cuz I had a 5
[27:16] gallon can of gas got the gas and uh as
[27:19] I was coming back out I'm not too far
[27:21] from R the river but there's a big
[27:23] stream that runs down and it was just
[27:25] about out in the road and I thought wow
[27:26] we won't be able to get back home so I
[27:28] kept going and the time I started back
[27:30] over to my son's house this is all in 30
[27:33] minutes time period you know there was
[27:36] wash outs in the road there was trees
[27:38] later I was driving around trees all the
[27:40] power is out and that's where I I
[27:42] learned you know just how much the water
[27:45] Rose so fast I said okay now I
[27:47] understand what a flash flood is because
[27:49] in 30 minutes everything everything had
[27:52] changed we were safe we got their
[27:54] basement pumped out and but you know
[27:57] just the devast I'm sure most of you
[27:59] seen it on the Internet it's you know
[28:01] it's it's real uh there may be some fake
[28:04] stuff out there but it's real and and we
[28:07] were fortunate we were blessed I think
[28:09] we were without electricity maybe for
[28:10] four hours but there's still people my
[28:13] in-laws Sharon's Mama dad he's 88 years
[28:16] old her mom's almost 85 they still don't
[28:20] have power they live almost in town so
[28:22] they've been over a week now without
[28:23] power and try to get them to stay with
[28:25] us and he's so obstinate
[28:31] difficult that he he don't want to do
[28:34] that but we finally got him to stay with
[28:36] us and so forth and uh but we took a
[28:38] generator last Monday in a grill up to
[28:41] one of the sisters in church it's very
[28:42] remote and we saw you know there used to
[28:45] be a house there used to be a trailer
[28:47] right there there used to be you know we
[28:49] saw houses were gone or where they used
[28:51] to be and uh roads that were wiped out
[28:55] power lines miles and miles and miles of
[28:59] power lines that were down and just it's
[29:01] incredible you know you just some places
[29:03] half the road was gone and just one lane
[29:05] road and you're driving around it and um
[29:08] it just unimaginable you know just hard
[29:11] to imagine I I'm 60 years old never see
[29:14] anything like it don't ever want to see
[29:16] like it again but um you know it I I
[29:21] guess I was amazed also by the outpour
[29:23] that we've received in the mountains I
[29:26] mean it's just truck after truck after
[29:27] truck TR after truck that's come in
[29:29] water Food Supplies cleaning supplies
[29:34] people volunteered I worked Wednesday at
[29:36] a a station uh where they were bringing
[29:39] in trucks we were offloading trucks
[29:41] sorting the product reboxing it sending
[29:43] it out into the neighborhoods and I was
[29:45] working with a guy that had come up from
[29:47] Raleigh and that's three and a half
[29:48] hours or thereabouts away from where we
[29:50] live and he's just there to volunteer I
[29:52] heard there's a guy over at our local
[29:54] Lowe's store that come from TS Oklahoma
[29:56] was out there fixing hot dogs for people
[29:58] and just you know so the outpouring has
[30:00] just been amazing and and we're thankful
[30:03] for that and a lot of people there that
[30:05] do need it that are trapped their homes
[30:07] but I'll ask you to remember in prayer
[30:09] that's it's great but you know these
[30:12] people as we were driving up we saw oil
[30:14] barrel after oil barrel in the river
[30:16] washed away or washed from homes and so
[30:20] we're getting ready to hit cold weather
[30:22] I know y'all don't have cold weather out
[30:23] here but we're getting ready to have
[30:25] cold weather it's cooling down and so
[30:27] those people don't even have a their
[30:28] heat Supply now so you know that's
[30:30] things that a lot of people hadn't
[30:31] thought about how are they going to get
[30:33] an oil barrel back to their house how
[30:35] they going to get it filled with oil how
[30:36] they going to get their furnace working
[30:38] you know gas tanks things like that
[30:40] nature and then a lot of these people
[30:42] they live in The Valleys they got a
[30:44] little stream they cross to get to their
[30:46] house or they cross the river or
[30:47] whatever and those bridges are gone and
[30:50] those aren't State Bridges those are
[30:51] private Bridges and so there's going to
[30:54] be a lot of work to
[30:56] do uh a lot of heavy lifting yet to do
[31:00] and so again I appreciate all that y'all
[31:02] are doing sending offerings I know
[31:03] brother Donnie's church is doing an
[31:05] amazing job with the Buri of coffee it's
[31:06] different ones and so appreciate that
[31:08] appreciate your prayers and so now I
[31:11] don't have to tell you all the story
[31:12] when we get done okay I hope I covered
[31:15] everything but yes it's it it it's quite
[31:18] amazing but let me go to the scripture
[31:20] this morning again where we started at
[31:22] here from The Book of Daniel the 10th
[31:24] chapter and Daniel being in division I
[31:26] want I want to take a little fault this
[31:28] morning Lord put on my heart on hold
[31:31] on help is on the way amen hold on thank
[31:36] you Lord help is on the way and I got a
[31:39] little bit of a reality of that just in
[31:41] our local County there with this
[31:44] flooding from uh hell and the the
[31:46] hurricane I've seen a video clip of a of
[31:50] a a gentleman that tried you know I
[31:52] can't understand people that Dy to drive
[31:54] through this murky muddy water to get
[31:56] somewhere you know don't do that maybe
[31:58] your life is in danger you do it if it's
[32:00] a life or death situation because it
[32:02] very well could be you're going to die
[32:04] trying to do it and so you just don't do
[32:06] that right but I saw a video clip of
[32:08] this gentleman was trying to drive
[32:10] through water there in our local County
[32:11] and he was actually trying to get the
[32:13] check on his parents um and his truck a
[32:17] little little Ranger truck it flooded
[32:19] out in the middle of the water he gets
[32:21] out and he's on the low side of the
[32:22] pickup and the water is hitting the
[32:23] upper side truck see he's protected I
[32:25] don't know how the little truck was not
[32:26] being moved but the of the water that
[32:28] was H it but his father has a little bit
[32:31] of a construction business and he took a
[32:34] he took a a backo and went out into the
[32:37] water the back ho and trying to get his
[32:39] son with a bucket of the back ho and the
[32:42] water started moving the backo out of
[32:44] the way and aidos keeps rolling and and
[32:47] the son gets into the back with his dad
[32:50] and it's washing down stream someone and
[32:53] it I I I've heard two different reports
[32:55] heard one they got out into a pine tree
[32:57] and and other I heard hey they were
[32:59] still in the cab of this uh this uh back
[33:03] ho but you see the water and you see
[33:05] about that much of the top of that back
[33:07] Co and and one person told me said yeah
[33:10] they were standing up there trying to
[33:11] get air and breathe but they took they
[33:13] got a boat out to rescue them uh and
[33:16] they rescued them and they but they were
[33:17] they were holding they were holding on
[33:20] and you know I can imagine you know if
[33:21] you're in that situation there was
[33:23] people that were in trees that they had
[33:25] to rescue out of trees and some people
[33:27] you know maybe they for hours waiting on
[33:29] someone to come and and to help them
[33:31] someone to come to get to them and and
[33:34] and to rescue them and you know they're
[33:36] holding on but you know you there's a
[33:38] point in time where your strength begins
[33:40] to diminish you begin to wonder my hey
[33:42] how much longer can I hold on and we you
[33:45] know I've heard stories of people that
[33:46] were in a tree maybe for seven hours and
[33:49] then they're gone they're gone they
[33:50] couldn't hold on any longer they and the
[33:52] and the waters swept them away and so
[33:54] forth and you know it's a tragedy I me
[33:57] but you know I I I look at that as a
[33:58] spiritual application also that a lot of
[34:01] you I mean we know the Bible talks about
[34:04] when the enemy comes in like a
[34:06] flood right he comes in like a flood
[34:09] into our lives and he tries to overwhelm
[34:11] us he tries to overflow us he tries to
[34:14] put more upon us than we can stand and
[34:16] we're bombarded and and and and thank
[34:19] God that scripture doesn't end that he
[34:21] comes in like a flood but it says the
[34:23] spirit of the Lord will raise up a
[34:24] standard against him amen aren't you
[34:27] glad there someone amen that whenever
[34:29] you're holding on for dear life that
[34:31] there's someone that is there amen he'll
[34:33] be there for you he's there in time amen
[34:37] you know anybody wants to tell you to
[34:38] give up to quit amen but hold on in this
[34:40] scripture that I read this morning here
[34:43] from Daniel it talks about Daniel and we
[34:45] know that he was in three weeks of
[34:47] prayer that first he had had vision and
[34:49] he was understanding the Captivity of
[34:51] Israel and and how that there was a
[34:54] limited time to that and was coming to
[34:56] an end and he had these vision and he
[34:58] went into mourning and and and fasting
[35:01] and seeking the Lord here the Bible says
[35:03] for three full weeks seeking you know
[35:07] what's going to happen but he says that
[35:09] he was there and we we we know the
[35:12] scriptures we read here that that uh as
[35:14] he had went out from this place that he
[35:16] was out at the Riverbanks and he's
[35:19] looking around and he sees someone and
[35:21] he has a vision here's the Lord Jesus
[35:24] Christ appearing to him amen you know
[35:27] you have to read the parts I didn't read
[35:29] amen and uh uh but he sees that and and
[35:32] and he trembles and he's like he's
[35:33] asleep he's he passes out in fear and
[35:36] the next thing you knows there's a
[35:38] there's a hand that touches him an angel
[35:41] had come to him this wasn't the the same
[35:43] one that he saw that he had a vision of
[35:45] that he was fearful of but this is an
[35:47] angel comes and touches Daniel and tells
[35:50] him rise up he said you know Daniel said
[35:53] said listen from the first day that you
[35:57] that you said your heart Amen to
[35:59] understand and to to chasten yourself to
[36:01] seek the Lord he said thy God thy words
[36:04] were heard amen and I have come because
[36:08] of your
[36:09] words but he goes on to tell him says
[36:11] now but the prince of the kingdom of
[36:15] Persia with stood stood me one in one in
[36:18] 20 days but Lo Michael one of the chief
[36:20] priests came to help me but remained
[36:24] there with the kings of Persia now you
[36:26] know I I don't know how your mind works
[36:27] but a lot of times when I'm reading
[36:29] something like this man I start getting
[36:30] mental pictures I don't know maybe you
[36:33] maybe you don't work that way but you
[36:34] know this it starts playing out in the
[36:37] you know the stage of my mind the things
[36:39] that are going on I'm envisioning it
[36:41] what's happening and so forth and and
[36:44] you know I've always had one way that I
[36:46] solve this but this morning I just want
[36:49] to talk about maybe three
[36:51] scenarios that happened here or could
[36:54] have
[36:55] happened uh in this situation where here
[36:59] is the angel trying to get to Daniel but
[37:03] the Prince of Persia of the kingdom of
[37:05] Persia is resisting him now the first
[37:08] scenario I I I want to go to I first let
[37:11] me scroll back here that very first
[37:15] verse Daniel CH chap first verse says it
[37:18] it tells us the time frame it says in
[37:20] the third year of cus King of Persia so
[37:24] that's Daniel setting the time frame but
[37:27] if we look we know that in
[37:30] Ezra the first
[37:32] chapter and the first verse it tells us
[37:35] now in the first year of Cyrus King of
[37:39] Persia that the word of the Lord came to
[37:42] the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled
[37:44] the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus
[37:46] King of Persia that he made a
[37:48] proclamation throughout all of his
[37:49] kingdom and put it also in the writing
[37:52] saying thus saith Cyrus King of Persia
[37:55] the Lord God Of Heaven have given me
[37:57] all the kingdoms of the earth and he
[37:59] have charged me to build him a house at
[38:02] Jerusalem in Judah amen so here's this
[38:06] this Syrian King if you would I mean now
[38:09] he's got a vision from the Lord to build
[38:12] rebuild the Temple that is in Jerusalem
[38:15] and so he sends a delegation as are
[38:17] different ones to go to Jerusalem to
[38:20] rebuild the Temple and uh we know that
[38:24] the responsibility of restructing the
[38:26] Temple it fell upon the governor of
[38:29] Judah which was zerubabel and upon the
[38:32] high priest which was josua that was the
[38:36] two people that was mainly I guess God
[38:40] had looked to to build this now and so
[38:42] this construction is going on this is
[38:45] two years before Daniel's having this
[38:47] vision and it's going on and we see this
[38:50] and and we we know amen that and I read
[38:54] this little clip it here from Matthew
[38:56] Henry's commentary
[38:58] he said that Cyrus's son chamus Prince
[39:01] of Persia had been very busy harassing
[39:04] the Affairs of the Jews and to do them
[39:08] all the Mischief he could and the angel
[39:10] had been all the time employed to
[39:11] counterwork him so he had been
[39:14] constrained to defer his visit to Daniel
[39:16] till now and so what the theory there is
[39:19] is okay here's in Jerusalem they're
[39:22] trying to rebuild the Temple and now
[39:25] there's this opposition that is going on
[39:28] to the building of the temple and the
[39:31] word here the angel that was going to
[39:33] come to Daniel now is been deployed to
[39:37] to to Jerusalem to fight against the
[39:40] opposition and things that are happening
[39:42] to stop the Temple construction you know
[39:45] I guess I had never really thought too
[39:46] much about that how that you know maybe
[39:49] that was even a possibility or whatever
[39:51] but we we find also there in the book of
[39:54] Ezra when you look at the fourth chapter
[39:59] and the first verse it says now when the
[40:02] adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard
[40:04] that the children of captivity build the
[40:06] temple unto the Lord God of Israel then
[40:10] they came to zerubabel and to the chief
[40:13] of the fathers and said to them let us
[40:16] build with you for ye we for we seek
[40:20] your God as ye do and we do sacrifice
[40:24] unto him and so you know they're looking
[40:28] at hey let us come to but you notice
[40:29] that first verse said the adversaries of
[40:33] Judah and
[40:34] Benjamin and they saw work going on they
[40:37] saw a temple that was being rebuilt and
[40:40] so they come amen it it it reminds me of
[40:43] guess of uh the first sealing the white
[40:45] horse rider how that you know Satan
[40:47] disguising himself and and wanting to
[40:50] come in and and infiltrate in and and
[40:53] become a Believer because he can do
[40:54] damage when he does that right when he
[40:56] becomes in begins with his pretense he
[40:58] can he can can't call T and tell you
[41:00] brother on here's how you ought to run
[41:02] your church here's how what you ought to
[41:03] do and how hey there's people that will
[41:05] come in Satan will send people in under
[41:08] the disguise of being a Believer to tell
[41:10] somebody else hey you know what you
[41:11] don't work you don't need to worship
[41:12] that way you know you don't need to do
[41:14] that you don't need to pray you know
[41:16] that hey and that's what was going on
[41:19] here is these adversaries these
[41:21] Assyrians the the people of the land
[41:23] were coming to zeruel said hey let us
[41:26] build with you because you know we
[41:28] worship all after all we all worship the
[41:30] same
[41:31] God that's you know that that's what uh
[41:34] that's what happening and um it actually
[41:38] tells here that uh that they were of
[41:41] assur which is the
[41:43] Assyrians um the third verse says but B
[41:46] zerubu and jerus or excuse me and Joshua
[41:50] and the rest of the chief fathers of V
[41:52] said unto him ye have nothing to do with
[41:55] us Amen to build the house unto our God
[41:59] but we ourselves together will build
[42:01] unto the Lord God of Israel as king
[42:05] Cyrus the king of the Persians have
[42:07] commanded us the fourth verse see this
[42:11] then the people land weakened the hands
[42:14] of the people of Judah and troubled them
[42:15] in building and hired counselors against
[42:18] them to frustrate their purpose all the
[42:20] days of Cyrus King of Persia even un the
[42:22] reign of darus King of Persia so here it
[42:25] is now oh you so you want to accept and
[42:27] just you know join together with us you
[42:30] know the Pagan Rome coming Pap Rome and
[42:33] so forth let's just blend it all
[42:34] together that's that's what their their
[42:36] intent was and so they said no we're not
[42:39] going to we're not going to accept that
[42:40] So then whenever they couldn't come in
[42:42] and be accepted among them and said hey
[42:44] let's oppose them let's weaken the hands
[42:46] of the people in trying to build a
[42:48] temple of God and trying to construct
[42:50] this Temple and then they hired
[42:52] counselors you know we're we're going to
[42:53] frustrate their work amen we're going to
[42:55] hire counselors we're going to send them
[42:56] under king of uh Osirus here and tell
[43:00] them you know what these people they
[43:01] they're going to reject you as king and
[43:03] and so they were you know this whole
[43:05] thing is working it's the
[43:07] politics hey they had politics going on
[43:10] here and so this is where you see that
[43:14] all of a sudden there was opposition
[43:16] going on to the
[43:17] construction and where this Prince of
[43:21] Persia is coming and opposing the work
[43:26] and the the the powers of God are are
[43:29] turned to try to to resolve that now you
[43:34] know we see a lot of things happening in
[43:36] the natural but unfortunately we don't
[43:39] see what's going on behind the scenes
[43:41] spiritually like we should you know that
[43:44] and Satan wants to he wants us to see
[43:47] everything that everybody else is doing
[43:49] he wants us to see the problems he wants
[43:51] us to take everything at face value and
[43:54] at the natural level but we that we
[43:56] never look beyond that that we never see
[43:59] the spiritual aspect we never see the
[44:01] powers of Darkness that are working
[44:03] behind the scen but the scripture here
[44:05] tells us about the powers of Darkness
[44:08] that are working behind the scenes and
[44:09] that is in Zechariah the thir chapter
[44:12] Zechariah the 3 chapter the first verse
[44:15] and it says and he showed me Joshua the
[44:20] high priest standing before the angel of
[44:23] the Lord and Satan standing his right
[44:26] hand to to resist him so here's Joshua
[44:29] the high priest that is one of those
[44:32] people that has been given the
[44:33] responsibility to rebuild the Temple you
[44:35] building this Temple and it's showing us
[44:37] here in a spiritual realm that Satan is
[44:40] standing there resisting what he's
[44:43] trying to do amen you know here's Joshua
[44:45] and zerubba they look out they see the
[44:48] syrians they see the enemy they see what
[44:50] they're trying to do but yet in the
[44:52] spiritual realm there's a battle going
[44:54] on there's a resistance going on and so
[44:57] this angel that was trying to get to
[44:59] Daniel say you know the Prince of Persia
[45:02] he withstood me aen he got in the way he
[45:04] interfered in my ability to get to you
[45:07] because of all that was going on in
[45:10] Jerusalem and all that the the the
[45:13] rhetoric that was going on with uh uh uh
[45:15] Cyrus the King of Persia now
[45:18] listen if
[45:21] this uh
[45:23] depiction is
[45:25] correct can you imagine the spiritual
[45:28] battles that are happening right now
[45:31] amen right now in Israel whenever here's
[45:35] Iran firing what 181 ballistic missiles
[45:38] or whatever Hypersonic missiles toward
[45:41] Jerusalem toward Tel
[45:43] Aviv there's a battle going on but here
[45:46] you know Lebanon and Hezbollah and the
[45:49] hoies and uh whatever else they're all
[45:51] out there Hamas all trying to come
[45:54] against the people of Israel and you
[45:57] know I can imagine yes you know here we
[45:59] are we got our issues but I can believe
[46:01] that there's forces of God that have
[46:03] been
[46:04] deployed yeah we know that there's
[46:06] American troops there and we've got
[46:08] warships and we've got all these other
[46:10] things and so does Israel and so forth
[46:12] but I want you to know something we see
[46:13] that with a natural eye but in the
[46:15] spiritual realm there are powers amen
[46:18] that are at Battle right now over Israel
[46:21] amen there's powers of Darkness that
[46:23] want to destroy Israel there's powers of
[46:25] the enemy that are are that said we're
[46:27] going to wipe them all out right so we
[46:30] see this amen we know that so can you
[46:32] imagine and and this hey this doesn't
[46:35] even talk about what's going on with
[46:37] Russia and China and you know the Russia
[46:40] trying to you know threaten America and
[46:43] the different things that are going on
[46:44] so you know just imagine the the powers
[46:48] of God that have been
[46:50] employed God is fighting for
[46:54] Israel I don't know how long America
[46:56] will fight for isra
[46:57] but God is fighting for Israel amen God
[47:01] is preserving Israel I guess you've
[47:02] heard it you know the reports brother
[47:04] Ron B even told it but you know what if
[47:06] he did amen how that out of the 181
[47:07] missiles that were fired toward
[47:09] Jerusalem that there was one death and
[47:11] it was a Palestinian
[47:13] Muslim Hallelujah all of their missiles
[47:17] and I don't believe it was just amen
[47:20] United States amen firing interceptors
[47:22] that stopped that I believe it was the
[47:24] powers of God Amen that were amen those
[47:27] missiles it might have been headed right
[47:28] for a populated area it might have been
[47:30] headed for a hospital amen but I believe
[47:33] there was an angel of the Lord amen that
[47:34] guided that missile they were guided
[47:36] missiles they just weren't Guided by the
[47:39] ones they wanted the the way they wanted
[47:40] to be guided but I believe there was
[47:42] guided missiles but the hand of almighty
[47:44] God that took those missiles amen and
[47:46] put them somewhere else amen the ones
[47:49] that weren't intercepted amen so you can
[47:51] see him and there's things that are
[47:52] going on that that that the depiction
[47:55] here of of the interruption of the
[47:57] temple construction and Daniel praying
[47:59] and and so forth how that that is is
[48:02] correct we know Ezra the 9th chapter
[48:04] familiar scripture to us the fourth
[48:06] verse says and the Lord said unto him go
[48:09] through the midst of the city through
[48:11] the midst of Jerusalem set a mark upon
[48:13] the foreheads of the men that sigh and
[48:14] cry for all the Abominations that be
[48:17] done in the midst thereof amen don't you
[48:20] forget about Israel amen you know we get
[48:23] caught up in our own problems but don't
[48:25] you forget about brother B said that was
[48:27] God's time piece over there you want to
[48:29] see what's going on you want know what
[48:31] time it is you watch is or you see is or
[48:33] right so I see that that you know I see
[48:36] that scenario but you know the scenario
[48:39] I guess that I'd always envisioned when
[48:41] I read this about the angel trying to
[48:43] get to Daniel uh I'd always envisioned
[48:46] hey is your name Daniel your name your
[48:50] mom and dad misnamed you didn't they
[48:51] come on you can be Daniel this morning
[48:54] so you know I man come come on Daniel
[48:57] come over here you got a better seat you
[48:58] got the best seat in the house sit down
[49:00] right
[49:00] here so Daniel what is your
[49:04] name Daniel
[49:08] okay listen forgive them for messing up
[49:11] all right my mom called me Lindsay I've
[49:13] had to live with that for 60 years she
[49:15] messed up you can get over it makes you
[49:17] stronger so so here's Daniel and
[49:25] uh here's de
[49:27] he's been seeking the Lord and his his
[49:30] words are heard and the angel is trying
[49:32] to trying to get to trying to get to him
[49:36] and you know I've always envisioned that
[49:37] angel trying to come to uh to get to
[49:40] Daniel and here's the here's the powers
[49:43] of Darkness that are opposing him won't
[49:45] let him get there now I don't know maybe
[49:46] that's not the way you've depicted this
[49:48] in your in your mind this but that's
[49:50] kind of way brother Austin good to see
[49:51] you brother that I've I've depicted this
[49:54] that here the Devil he's there he's over
[49:56] there and this Angel's trying to get to
[49:58] him and the devil's opposing him thank
[50:00] you you didn't know he's an angel y'all
[50:01] he's an angel and so you know trying to
[50:04] get the Daniel to help
[50:06] Daniel you know that that's that's kind
[50:08] of the way that I've seen that you know
[50:10] that here is he's it's way off over here
[50:12] the Angels trying to get there and uh
[50:16] you know I uh you know the story how
[50:18] that brother brandom he had prayed for
[50:20] two neighbor women one of them had
[50:23] stomach issues and could not eat the
[50:26] other one had a big water or growth on
[50:28] her neck and brother B prayed for him in
[50:31] the same meeting and he he says this he
[50:35] says this in the the message healing
[50:37] what is cancer or what cancer is rather
[50:40] he said I told you many times the
[50:42] testimony of the people of how sometimes
[50:44] the angel Lord will pronounce that in in
[50:48] a case I don't know whether I was
[50:49] telling it the other day or not a woman
[50:52] had a stomach Pro trouble another woman
[50:54] with a growth on her neck and the spirit
[50:56] of the Lord told told them that they
[50:57] were healed told her to go home and eat
[51:00] while the woman couldn't eat she had
[51:01] tried 6 weeks nearly and she just made
[51:05] it got so sick and she could she kept
[51:08] trying and said one morning uh while at
[51:11] breakfast the dishes was being washed
[51:14] she felt a cool something sweep over her
[51:16] now he don't tell it in this article but
[51:18] he he says that you know she's getting
[51:20] so hungry and so weak and she said I
[51:23] guess the kid somebody left a piece of
[51:24] toast on a plate and and said she just
[51:27] looked down that piece of toast and she
[51:29] picked up that piece of toast thought
[51:30] maybe I can eat this and so she eat that
[51:33] piece of toast and and and nothing
[51:36] happened it didn't bother and then I
[51:37] think I think he tells there that that
[51:40] maybe she got her a bowl of Oats amen
[51:42] and began to eat the oats and and and it
[51:44] didn't bother her and then she thought
[51:46] my you know I'm going to drink a cup of
[51:48] coffee and she got a cup of coffee and
[51:50] drunk that cup of coffee amen but here
[51:53] he says he says she she found out that
[51:55] she could eat today
[51:57] something cooled swep over and she found
[51:59] out she could eat she ran to her
[52:00] neighbor to tell her about about it and
[52:03] she found her neighbor just screaming
[52:04] and shouting the growth that was on her
[52:07] neck had left what was it the angel of
[52:10] the Lord six weeks later six weeks later
[52:15] passed through that neighborhood
[52:18] confirming the word of God with signs
[52:20] following he has to do it how many knows
[52:23] that Daniel Prayed one time and the
[52:25] angel couldn't even get to him for 21
[52:27] days amen so we see amen that that that
[52:30] yes you know you pray and the if you
[52:32] don't get in the meeting ask you know
[52:33] what the devil wants he wants you to
[52:35] disbelieve the word of God he wants you
[52:36] to believe that it didn't happen he
[52:38] wants you to believe that you're not
[52:39] going to be healed or your prayer is not
[52:41] going to be answered hold on hold on
[52:44] Amen because I tell you help is on the
[52:47] way amen for six weeks she tried these
[52:50] she couldn't amen amen you know what
[52:52] everybody's supp to say I heard you went
[52:54] up to that heiller I heard you had you
[52:56] had whatever and you heard you said just
[52:58] healed amen yes 6 weeks later you know
[53:01] it's just like that John Ryan to come
[53:03] blind John Ryan comeing across a
[53:05] platform Amen brother Ram said you're
[53:07] healed you know and he walks off and
[53:08] he's just it's just as dark as it's ever
[53:10] been Daniel you okay down there you okay
[53:13] all right good hey I got a water here do
[53:16] you need a water you need a water okay I

[53:22] something we might get you bagel and uh
[53:26] you know John Ryden went off there he
[53:27] man I can't see you know I'm just just
[53:29] as dark and blind as I have ever been
[53:31] and so he he's dirty he thought man
[53:33] brother B must have made a mistake so he
[53:35] goes back around gets back in line comes
[53:37] back up again you know brother Brown I
[53:38] think took his hand whatever it was hey
[53:40] he's already healed there's no vibration
[53:41] there's nothing there he's healed you're
[53:43] healed you know you got to go Proclaim
[53:45] that thing you know the story better
[53:46] than I know amen he went off amen and he
[53:49] he got that revelation of healing amen
[53:51] so he goes off and he starts proclaiming
[53:53] uh brother James his his uh healing amen
[53:56] and he's telling everybody handing out
[53:58] newspapers whatever selling newspapers
[54:00] that he's healed he goes down to the
[54:01] barber shop and you know the barber
[54:03] start to make a little bit of fun of we
[54:04] sat down there says I hear you've been
[54:05] down there that healer and and and and
[54:07] you're telling every about you're healed
[54:09] he said that's right said I'm Healed and
[54:11] about that time guess what happen it
[54:13] didn't happen when he walked across that
[54:15] platform am man it didn't happen maybe
[54:17] when he thought it ought to happen but
[54:19] I'm going to tell you something he
[54:20] believed in anyway he believed the word
[54:22] of a prophet and said yeah you are
[54:24] healed amen and guess what as some point
[54:26] in time th healing was manifested and
[54:29] it's what you've got to do it's what
[54:30] we've got to do amen it says I think
[54:32] it's Hebrews the third chapter the first
[54:34] verse that he is the high priest of our
[54:36] profession amen that you make that
[54:38] profession you Proclaim it and he is
[54:40] high priest he begins to operate he
[54:43] begins to work to bring your profession
[54:45] to pass praise the Lord amen you know
[54:49] when Jesus he he he went into the
[54:52] Wilderness and was tempted of the devil
[54:54] the Bible says that he fasted for days
[54:56] and the devil came to him with the three
[54:59] Temptations you know you're hungry here
[55:00] turn these stones to bread you know cast
[55:03] yourself off the temple here worship me
[55:06] here's all the the the kings of the
[55:08] world I'll give them to you and Jesus
[55:11] rebuked the devil it is written we know
[55:13] that amen and that word steal will
[55:17] defeat the Devil any place anytime
[55:19] anywhere right amen and so he he rebuked
[55:23] the devil then after he rebuked the
[55:25] devil the Bible ible says then then the
[55:29] Angels Came and ministered unto him you
[55:33] know when the devil left him behold the
[55:34] Angels Came it's Matthew the 4th chapter
[55:36] 11 verse and minister to him so
[55:38] sometimes you know yeah you go through
[55:39] the
[55:40] battle this because you're in a battle
[55:42] don't mean you're defeated that's right
[55:44] Heen just because you don't feel
[55:46] anything don't mean you're defeated now
[55:48] see that's what Satan wants you to think
[55:49] amen well you prayed nothing happened
[55:52] you know you prayed far nothing happened
[55:54] what that's what the enemy wants to
[55:55] convince you of but you got to hold on
[55:57] Amen there's comes a point in time you
[55:59] got to outweight the
[56:02] devil did you hear me there's a time
[56:06] that you got to outweight the devil amen
[56:09] because now the devil's going to wait
[56:10] he's going to hang by your side but if
[56:12] you just keep holding on sooner or later
[56:14] that Devil's going to be defeated am but
[56:17] you can't give up you got to have some
[56:18] perseverance some persistence as a
[56:21] prophet of God talked about him and you
[56:22] got to outweight that devil you got to
[56:24] hold on Amen cuz soon later he's going
[56:27] to be defeated and you're going to see
[56:29] receive the victory you cannot give up
[56:31] amen don't you give up a so you know
[56:33] that's I see that I've left Daniel up
[56:36] here amen for the purpose because you
[56:38] know that's the way that I envisioned
[56:40] that at off at a distance here's the
[56:42] angel trying to get the Daniel and and
[56:44] the devil the Prince of Persia was
[56:46] trying to oppose
[56:48] him but then the third scenario that the
[56:50] Lord just kind of dealt with my heart on
[56:52] was that that here's the angel come on
[56:55] back up here angel you're work wasn't
[56:56] done you ain't never got here
[56:58] yet and come on up here yes on the
[57:03] platform yeah yeah come on up here Don't
[57:07] Preach here's Daniel seeking here's the
[57:12] angel right here to minister to him but
[57:16] between those is the devil and the
[57:18] devil's standing here saying wait a
[57:19] minute you know what your prayers don't
[57:21] mean anything you you prayed that don't
[57:23] mean anything they didn't hear your
[57:24] prayers you didn't hear
[57:26] you know that scenario is probably the
[57:28] scenario in the ancient Lord right here
[57:31] and yet we're we're we're here like oh
[57:33] Lord we do this and the devil's right
[57:35] there Whispering Your Ears well you're
[57:36] not going to be healed you're not going
[57:37] to be delivered your children will not
[57:38] be saved and and the the L Angel Lord
[57:41] thank you thank you you can be seated
[57:43] you know that and that scenario where
[57:45] the the devil is in our ears so that the
[57:47] angel Lord can't get to us amen because
[57:50] the enemy is telling us all these things
[57:53] that that he wants us to hear he's bomb
[57:56] farting in my mind he's he's battle the
[57:58] greatest battle ever fought was in the
[57:59] mind right and so the enemy trying to
[58:01] feel your mind you know how it is you've
[58:03] heard him mayen whenever you was praying
[58:05] for something a desperate need you
[58:07] didn't feel anything you didn't hear
[58:08] anything you know the pre the the
[58:10] minister the pastor whoever didn't even
[58:12] mention what you've been praying about
[58:14] and and the devil's sitting there
[58:16] whispering in years it's not going to
[58:17] happen it's not going to happen you
[58:19] might as well give up your might as well
[58:20] quit he he's done it for somebody else
[58:22] but he's not going to do it for you that
[58:24] devil in your ear battling your mind so
[58:26] that you cannot receive the word of God
[58:28] you cannot receive the thought from God
[58:31] you cannot receive the visitation from
[58:33] almighty God we got to recognize that
[58:35] that's a power of Darkness amen that is
[58:37] trying to block the the things of God
[58:39] from getting to
[58:42] you that's right listen brother bam s a
[58:46] message of trial he said your
[58:50] healing might
[58:52] be five minutes away
[58:56] way your
[58:58] unbelief will keep it away from as long
[59:01] as you live that's right now think about
[59:03] that here it is amen it's right there
[59:08] but if the devil can get you and
[59:10] convince you of
[59:13] unbelief that he takes it away from you
[59:15] forever I mean how close is it it's
[59:18] right there some of you been holding on
[59:20] to God Amen don't you quit holding on
[59:22] he's right there praise God you've been
[59:25] praying maybe for years amen don't you
[59:27] give up and quit listening to the devil
[59:30] quit letting the devil persuade you that
[59:32] it is not going to happen that it is not
[59:34] good enough that it's it's too far down
[59:36] the road or whatever you've not you know
[59:39] oh well you know youve really not prayed
[59:40] enough you haven't fasted enough you
[59:42] need to give more money if you give more
[59:43] money amen we'll get your we'll get your
[59:45] loved one out of purgatory we're not
[59:48] Catholics come on come on we're not we
[59:51] don't pay the price he paid the price
[59:55] hallelujah thank God I don't have to pay
[59:57] the price he paid it Hallelujah hey you
[1:00:00] know what he did he don't only pay it
[1:00:02] brother Ron but he stood there and he
[1:00:03] said in is finished in other words you
[1:00:06] don't have to add to it and you can't
[1:00:08] take away from it all we got to do is
[1:00:11] believe it amen don't you listen to the
[1:00:13] devil tell you well it ain't going to
[1:00:15] happen listen brother Bram said in that
[1:00:17] greatest battle that ever fought the
[1:00:18] Battle here you know we know in mind he
[1:00:20] said Satan and his demons anoints
[1:00:23] Humanity to disbelieve God's
[1:00:27] word so that's what he's doing you're
[1:00:29] holding on to God you're crying out to
[1:00:31] God God's got an answer for you he's got
[1:00:35] a Deliverance for you he's got a help
[1:00:37] for you and yet the devil's whispered in
[1:00:40] your ear all the things trying to bring
[1:00:42] an anointing on you to disbelieve the
[1:00:45] word of God to disbelieve what God Said
[1:00:48] what God had promised I mean so we see
[1:00:50] amen these scenarios now you know when
[1:00:53] the enemy begins to battle our mind and
[1:00:56] just because I'm taking my coat off
[1:00:57] doesn't mean I'm going to preach that
[1:00:58] much longer I'm almost done but I'm just
[1:01:00] hot okay and I don't never normally
[1:01:02] preach the jacket on
[1:01:04] anyway but uh you know I anyway forget
[1:01:08] it
[1:01:10] so we let's go back here just a little
[1:01:13] bit to the building of the temple can we
[1:01:14] do that just for a
[1:01:18] second you
[1:01:20] remember this opposition there from Ezra
[1:01:22] the 4th
[1:01:24] chapter that comes
[1:01:26] these adversaries that were opposing the
[1:01:28] construction of the temple and they had
[1:01:31] come against zerubabel and they come
[1:01:33] against Joshua the high priest and they
[1:01:36] got so
[1:01:37] discouraged that they stopped the
[1:01:40] work they built they laid the
[1:01:42] foundation but if you read in the
[1:01:44] scripture you'll find out that they they
[1:01:46] stopped they stopped work and it was the
[1:01:48] whole time that King Cyrus was was King
[1:01:52] and and I I I think he was King for
[1:01:54] approximately 40 years there about you
[1:01:56] can go back and look it up amen and for
[1:01:59] that that period of time here they had
[1:02:01] they had stopped the the construction of
[1:02:03] the
[1:02:04] temple they got that discouraged they
[1:02:07] went on with their lives they went on
[1:02:09] building their homes building their
[1:02:11] lives you know and and left the temple
[1:02:14] set there or the foundation of the
[1:02:16] temple set
[1:02:18] there and God got to the point that he
[1:02:22] took a little Prophet by the name of Hai
[1:02:24] and sent down to zerubba
[1:02:27] and said you know what y'all are living
[1:02:28] up here in your ceel
[1:02:30] houses but my house where's my house at
[1:02:33] amen go read there's just two chapters
[1:02:35] go read it amen so you know here God God
[1:02:38] get the point he's fed up with hey you
[1:02:39] know you you've turned your attention
[1:02:41] toward everything everything else you
[1:02:44] know but they were that they were that
[1:02:45] low they got that discouraged because of
[1:02:47] the opposition and that's what Satan
[1:02:49] wants to do right he wants you to get so
[1:02:51] discouraged amen that that you just stop
[1:02:54] the work of God you just stop stop amen
[1:02:56] trying to do something and listen if if
[1:02:59] Satan was was that opposed to the
[1:03:02] building of a natural building for the
[1:03:04] temple of
[1:03:06] God what about the the spiritual Temple
[1:03:10] because that Temple that it finally got
[1:03:12] built right they built that Temple it
[1:03:14] was remodeled by Herod and so forth but
[1:03:16] yet General Titus come along and
[1:03:19] destroyed it but God had already moved
[1:03:21] out of that
[1:03:22] building amen he when he moved out he
[1:03:25] split the temple veil from the top to
[1:03:28] the bottom he moved out amen he moved
[1:03:30] into a different Temple he moved into a
[1:03:33] different dwelling place right he chose
[1:03:35] some other place to dwell know you not
[1:03:38] that you are the temple of God and that
[1:03:41] the the the the spirit of God dwells
[1:03:43] within you right amen so we're that
[1:03:45] Temple so if Satan was opposed to the
[1:03:48] construction of the natural
[1:03:51] Temple what about the the supernatural
[1:03:54] Temple what about the spiritual Temple
[1:03:57] amen he wants to discourage you amen you
[1:03:59] know what you just sit back don't you
[1:04:01] worry amen you you know you can just you
[1:04:04] sit there and and some preacher will
[1:04:05] come along and he'll wave his hanky over
[1:04:07] you and he might spit and slobber over
[1:04:09] you and you got the Holy Ghost and and
[1:04:11] and you're the temple of
[1:04:14] God oh yeah they'll that's what they'll
[1:04:16] do for you right that's what Satan will
[1:04:17] tell you right amen don't you don't you
[1:04:20] try to don't you seek God to become the
[1:04:22] temple of God Amen so Satan is is
[1:04:25] opposed to it and every every group that
[1:04:29] has ever
[1:04:31] Arisen amen that if they started off
[1:04:34] with any kind of indwelling of the
[1:04:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost Satan
[1:04:39] substituted that for something else
[1:04:42] because he's opposed to that he don't
[1:04:43] care how religious you are he don't care
[1:04:45] how many quotes you can quote and how
[1:04:47] much scripture you can quote amen
[1:04:49] because there's only one thing that
[1:04:50] makes that scripture real there's only
[1:04:52] one thing that makes those quotes real
[1:04:54] and that's the spirit of God anointing
[1:04:56] those amen so that makes it real so if
[1:04:59] he can get you a vessel yeah your mind
[1:05:01] may be full of the word your mind may be
[1:05:03] full of the quotes amen but as long as
[1:05:06] there's nothing there to make it real
[1:05:08] amen you're not a challenge to him he's
[1:05:10] not worried about you but all of a
[1:05:12] sudden when the H the power of God comes
[1:05:14] down and it begins to anoint the word
[1:05:16] that is in your heart amen it begins to
[1:05:19] anoint the quotes that are in your heart
[1:05:21] and it begins to make them real amen
[1:05:23] that fears Satan because he knows he has
[1:05:25] no nothing he has nothing Amen to do
[1:05:28] against that has nothing to oppose that
[1:05:32] amen he cannot argue with the Living
[1:05:35] Word remember Jesus those Temptations
[1:05:37] Satan it is written he didn't argue
[1:05:40] that's right he didn't say well let now
[1:05:42] wait a minute I I got a quote over here
[1:05:44] I got another scripture no he didn't
[1:05:45] argue he moved on to the next Temptation
[1:05:48] and that's what it is when you're when
[1:05:50] the word amen by the spirit of God
[1:05:52] begins to live in you amen Satan has no
[1:05:55] argu argument to that that word defeats
[1:05:58] him right and you say well wait a minute
[1:06:00] you I can say the word so could the sons
[1:06:02] of
[1:06:04] ska oh listen you know we adure thee by
[1:06:08] Jesus whom Paul preaches come out oh
[1:06:11] Jesus we know and Paul we know but who
[1:06:13] are you so they tried to quote the word
[1:06:15] right they were quoters there's a lot of
[1:06:18] quoters but we need to be more than
[1:06:20] quarters right we need something that is
[1:06:22] greater than just amen we need a living
[1:06:24] we need the word to come alive in us and
[1:06:27] it only does that but a spirit of God
[1:06:29] because it's all you know hey this is
[1:06:32] not the sword of Lindsay
[1:06:34] McGrady this is not the sword of Ron
[1:06:38] Peterson this is not the sword of
[1:06:40] brother Mario this is the sword of the
[1:06:43] Lord amen amen he it was a king sword
[1:06:46] that's right not a king sword but the
[1:06:49] king sword right amen it was the word of
[1:06:51] God so it's it takes the spirit of God
[1:06:54] in us to op at that word in our lives
[1:06:58] there's a lot of people that try to they
[1:06:59] can't do it I don't know why I'm saying
[1:07:00] these things again this this message
[1:07:02] what even know I wouldn't think thinking
[1:07:03] about this till an hour ago or whatever
[1:07:06] amen so we see that now you so zerubabel
[1:07:09] and and Joshua the God so that
[1:07:11] resistance Satan standing there to
[1:07:13] resist them they got so discouraged they
[1:07:16] quit amen until God send them heya the
[1:07:19] prophet Amen to to rebuke them and then
[1:07:22] they made that commitment we're going to
[1:07:24] build this Temple and they started but
[1:07:26] the word also came to Zechariah the
[1:07:29] prophet the fourth chapter and the sixth
[1:07:31] verse it said did he answer to sping to
[1:07:33] me saying this is the word of the Lord
[1:07:35] unto zerubabel saying not by might nor
[1:07:40] by power but by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:07:45] of hosts amen so we got to realize it
[1:07:47] and by our ability God I can't do this
[1:07:50] on my own I can't do this in my own
[1:07:53] strength oh lord it's not my wisdom a
[1:07:55] lot of people tried to do it in their
[1:07:57] understanding and their wisdom and you
[1:07:59] know what sooner or later they fail but
[1:08:01] I'm going to tell you something there's
[1:08:03] one that will not fail it's not by might
[1:08:06] nor by power but by my spirit sayith the
[1:08:09] Lord of hosts and it's a same today it's
[1:08:13] the same today Hallelujah we still need

[1:08:24] submit yourself therefore to God resist
[1:08:27] the devil amen sister Sandy resist that
[1:08:30] devil Amen in the name of sister Sandy

[1:08:34] the name amen and he will flee from you
[1:08:39] hallelujah amen that Devil's going to
[1:08:41] flee amen but you know what if he
[1:08:43] convict you no you're defeated you flee
[1:08:45] from him that's right but there's a time
[1:08:47] you got to hold on you got to help is
[1:08:50] coming amen hold on Amen 2 Corinthians
[1:08:52] the fourth the 10th chapter the fourth
[1:08:55] verse for the weapons of our Warfare
[1:08:57] they are
[1:08:58] not they're not carnal too often we try
[1:09:02] to approach everything from a carnal
[1:09:04] standpoint we try to work things out
[1:09:07] carnally I understand that you know I
[1:09:10] I'm analytical just by Nature you know I
[1:09:13] try to analyze everything and figure
[1:09:16] everything out from analytical
[1:09:18] standpoint why is this working or
[1:09:19] whatever amen but it it that's that's
[1:09:22] not the weapon that's going to defeat
[1:09:24] Satan amen it's not by might nor by
[1:09:27] power but by my spirit sayith the Lord
[1:09:29] for the weapons of our Warfare they are
[1:09:31] not carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:09:33] pulling down of strongholds oh Satan's
[1:09:37] tried to fortify himself someplace in
[1:09:39] your life every time you start getting
[1:09:42] spiritual every time God you start
[1:09:43] trying to do something for God he goes
[1:09:46] back maybe he goes back to the recesses
[1:09:48] of your memory and he begins to remind
[1:09:50] you of a failure in your past he begins
[1:09:53] to tell you of things that happened and
[1:09:54] were done and guess what now instead of
[1:09:57] you feeling like you can go out and do
[1:09:58] something for God Amen that you can
[1:10:00] accomplish something for him now amen
[1:10:02] all of a sudden you're carrying back in
[1:10:03] the quarter said oh yeah I failed so bad
[1:10:05] it was so bad it was terrible you know I
[1:10:07] I remember
[1:10:09] that that's a stronghold of Satan if
[1:10:12] he's always going to that to subdue
[1:10:15] you it's a stronghold but thank God
[1:10:19] we've got a weapon we got a weapon
[1:10:22] Hallelujah that is capable of pulling
[1:10:25] down every stronghold Hallelujah and he
[1:10:28] goes on there Amen in the fifth verse
[1:10:29] say casting down
[1:10:31] imaginations because that's where Satan
[1:10:34] amen gets into your mind and telling you
[1:10:37] amen of your defeat and of your your
[1:10:40] failures and of all the things that get
[1:10:42] the Bible says cast down it don't you
[1:10:44] entertain it don't you allow Satan to
[1:10:47] control your thoughts amen because if he
[1:10:50] does he's going to control you that's
[1:10:52] right if he can control your thoughts
[1:10:54] he'll control
[1:10:55] you amen so uh you casting down
[1:11:00] imaginations in every High thing that
[1:11:02] exalted s against the knowledge of God
[1:11:04] if it's against the word of God and it's
[1:11:06] trying to uh be contrary to the word of
[1:11:08] God he's trying to tell you things that
[1:11:10] are not correct according to the word
[1:11:12] amen you know what that is something is
[1:11:13] exalting itself above uh above uh the
[1:11:17] knowledge of God Amen and bring into
[1:11:20] captivity every thought into The
[1:11:21] Obedience of Christ help Lord so if
[1:11:24] Satan can get there and win that a mean

[1:13:08] going through and he's trying to get a
[1:13:10] word to you but that devil said well
[1:13:12] it's not for you it's for somebody else

[1:13:15] that need to be done amen see how he
[1:13:18] works amen Hebrews the 10th chapter the
[1:13:21] 35th verse says cast not away therefore

[1:13:25] recompense of reward for ye have need of
[1:13:28] patience that after you have done the

[1:13:45] that's right hold on the word amen I
[1:13:47] believe the answer is on the way amen
[1:13:48] there's a song like that somewhere along
[1:13:50] the answer's on the way amen just
[1:13:52] because the answer doesn't come
[1:13:54] immediately or or quickly as we'd like
[1:13:57] for it doesn't mean that it's not on the
[1:13:58] way that's right don't mean that that
[1:14:01] that things aren't already
[1:14:05] happening how often oh there situations
[1:14:09] I me so you know we going back there to

[1:15:21] times I guess she thinks I don't listen
[1:15:25] but everything she tells
[1:15:27] me she she repeats it three times and I
[1:15:33] want to say the first day you started
[1:15:36] talking I heard you the first time you
[1:15:39] know tell me I this this 45 minute

[1:15:52] for you amen so but he said you know the
[1:15:54] first time when you s when you when you
[1:15:56] put it in your heart when you got it in
[1:15:59] in your
[1:15:59] [Applause]
[1:16:00] heart to to to approach the
[1:16:04] throne that very first day you were hurt
[1:16:09] you get something in your heart amen you
[1:16:11] know a lot of times I think you know we
[1:16:12] we go through the exercise of prayer
[1:16:14] amen and we you know we got all the
[1:16:16] needs and all the situations and all the
[1:16:17] problems and we go through it and so
[1:16:19] forth but sometimes when there's
[1:16:20] something on your heart it's on your
[1:16:23] heart amen you you get on your your
[1:16:25] knees and you begin to cry out to Goden
[1:16:27] the devil starts he starts immediately
[1:16:29] it ain't going to happen it's too big
[1:16:30] you know God this that the other you
[1:16:33] know and and yet we know that on your
[1:16:36] heart said the first time it come on
[1:16:38] your heart Daniel from that very first
[1:16:40] day amen thy words were heard but he
[1:16:45] says he goes on Beyond thy words were
[1:16:48] heard but listen to Jus said and I am
[1:16:52] come for thy words
[1:16:55] I am come your words that you began to
[1:16:59] cry out on that first day it moved God
[1:17:03] and I am come because of your words now
[1:17:07] I'm going to tell you something maybe
[1:17:08] your name ain't
[1:17:10] Daniel maybe there's just a handful of
[1:17:12] Daniels in here and I could have
[1:17:13] probably picked one amen but he just
[1:17:15] looked too cute to leave him sitting
[1:17:16] there and so and and but I'm going to
[1:17:19] tell you something when you begin to
[1:17:21] pray things begin to happen thank you
[1:17:24] Lord God begins to move maybe you don't
[1:17:26] feel
[1:17:27] anything but something begins to happen
[1:17:30] God begins to work on the scene he
[1:17:31] begins to move amen the powers in heaven
[1:17:34] began to move praise God and so I'm
[1:17:36] going to tell you something I can
[1:17:37] believe that all three of these
[1:17:38] scenarios that I put before you are
[1:17:40] actually true and real that yes there
[1:17:43] are things that are happening in the
[1:17:44] natural that the spirit is moving behind
[1:17:47] the scene and there's war going on
[1:17:49] spiritually and and naturally and Israel
[1:17:51] so and the powers of God are are are
[1:17:54] working there I can see that I can
[1:17:56] believe that amen and I can believe also
[1:17:59] that you know the enemy is trying to
[1:18:00] oppose uh uh uh the presence of of that
[1:18:03] angel from getting to you but I can also
[1:18:06] we know for a fact amen that here we are
[1:18:09] crying out to God and the devil is
[1:18:11] battling our mind amen telling us it's
[1:18:13] not going to happen amen so I I see all
[1:18:16] three of these amen but listen amen
[1:18:19] don't give up because it's never too
[1:18:22] late again the devil will tell you it's
[1:18:24] too late
[1:18:25] you know put yourself in the in the in
[1:18:28] the shoes of Mary and
[1:18:31] Martha their brother is sick and he's
[1:18:34] dying and
[1:18:36] so you know they they send a message to
[1:18:40] Jesus we we've seen the supernatural
[1:18:42] power we know that it's real we know
[1:18:44] what he can do and here the one that he
[1:18:45] loves is is is sick unto death and send
[1:18:48] a message to him and the message gets to
[1:18:51] Jesus and and Jesus terries he waits
[1:18:55] and all the time while Jesus waiting

[1:19:03] you heard a messenger you know just keep
[1:19:04] watching just keep watching he's coming
[1:19:06] and here's Lazarus getting weaker and
[1:19:07] weaker and sicker and sicker and sicker
[1:19:10] and and until finally he said what's
[1:19:12] going on and the next thing you know
[1:19:13] there's no pulse there's no breath
[1:19:15] there's nothing and he's
[1:19:18] gone and they like man I thought for
