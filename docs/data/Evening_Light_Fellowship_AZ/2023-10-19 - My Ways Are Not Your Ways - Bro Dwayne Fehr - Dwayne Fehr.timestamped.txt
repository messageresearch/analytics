[25:30] tonight God bless
[25:32] you earlier this week I uh needed to
[25:36] learn a thing or two about love so I
[25:38] listened to When Love Project and
[25:41] brother brandom was talking about how he
[25:43] thought Jesus didn't like him but God
[25:45] loved him and he learned that Jesus was
[25:48] the very heart of God and
[25:51] um I I really enjoyed how you know I
[25:55] pulled the quote here he he just
[25:57] described how John 3:16 when God so
[26:00] loved the world that he gave his only
[26:02] begotten son that whosoever believeth on
[26:05] him would not perish but have
[26:07] everlasting life so he said God's love
[26:09] divine love to Adam's race when he loved
[26:11] it Christ stepped out Sovereign Grace
[26:14] took its
[26:16] place um so I thought I'd sing 10,000
[26:19] angels that Jesus could have called a
[26:22] host of angels to take him down off the
[26:24] cross but he didn't for you and I so I
[26:27] hope it's a blessing to you
[26:29] [Music]
[26:48] today they bound the hands of
[26:53] Jesus in the garden where he prayed
[26:57] [Music]
[27:01] they led him through the
[27:05] streets in
[27:09] [Music]
[27:11] shame they sped upon the
[27:16] Savior so pure and free from
[27:21] sin they said crucify him
[27:26] he
[27:28] to
[27:28] [Music]
[27:32] blame he could have
[27:37] called
[27:39] 10,000
[27:42] angels to destroy the
[27:45] [Music]
[27:47] world and set him
[27:53] free he could have
[27:56] called
[28:00] 10,000
[28:04] angels but he died
[28:06] [Music]
[28:09] alone for you and
[28:16] me upon his precious
[28:21] head they placed a crown of
[28:26] thorns they left and said
[28:32] behold the
[28:37] king they struck him and they cursed
[28:42] him and mocked His holy
[28:47] name all alone he
[28:52] suffered
[28:56] everything he he could have
[29:01] called 10,000
[29:06] Angel to destroy the
[29:09] [Music]
[29:11] world and set him
[29:17] free he could have
[29:22] called 10,000
[29:26] angels
[29:28] but he died
[29:32] alone for you and
[29:35] [Music]
[29:38] me when they nailed him to the
[29:44] Cross his mother stood
[29:49] nearby he said
[29:51] woman
[29:54] Behold thy
[29:56] son
[30:00] he cried High thirst for
[30:04] water but they gave them none to
[30:09] drink the sinful work of
[30:14] man was
[30:18] done he could have
[30:23] called 10,000 Ang
[30:29] to destroy the
[30:33] world and set him
[30:39] free he could have
[30:44] called 10,000
[30:48] angels body died
[30:51] [Music]
[30:53] alone for you and me
[31:01] to the howling mob he
[31:05] yielded he did not for Mercy
[31:10] cry the cross of Shame he
[31:15] took
[31:17] [Music]
[31:20] alone and when he cried he is
[31:25] finished he gave himself to
[31:30] die
[31:32] salvation's wonderous
[31:35] plan was
[31:40] done he could have
[31:45] called 10,000
[31:49] angels to destroy the
[31:54] world and set him
[32:01] free of
[32:05] God 10,000

[48:27] that's closer than that and that's the
[48:31] family of God and I'm so thankful that
[48:33] there's a tie that binds us closer than
[48:35] even blood relations you I'll tell you
[48:38] what you ever realize you ever get to
[48:40] the spot where you got family that's
[48:42] that's Wayward or family that hasn't
[48:43] come in yet your relationship with a
[48:46] Believer is closer than your blood
[48:48] family and there's only one thing that
[48:50] could do that that's the blood of Jesus
[48:51] Christ so I'm thankful that his spirit
[48:54] that there's a love that pass passes all
[48:56] of our understanding and and I trust
[48:58] tonight that some that the Lord will say
[49:00] something to you I you know if you come
[49:02] with an expectation God will grant you
[49:04] your
[49:05] expectation I was uh I was at some
[49:08] meetings down in newfinland one time and
[49:10] had a h you know I was preaching and I
[49:13] got talking about you know expectation
[49:15] how that this little song fill my cup

[49:35] to fill it and well the next day I met
[49:37] her just walking into the into the

[49:52] you I I mean he there ain't no shortage
[49:54] to what our God can do I think we just
[49:57] ought to expect great things all the
[49:58] time that you know that's just the way
[50:00] that's the kind of God we serve and I'm
[50:03] and I'm happy to be in uh in part of his
[50:05] great family anyhow just let me say
[50:08] thank you to uh brother Mark and sister
[50:10] Tina uh you know uh with the exception
[50:13] of your pastor and his wife you know
[50:15] there's a there's a every time you know
[50:18] us Northerners come down we get all this
[50:20] yeah God bless you brother Dwayne one of
[50:21] these days we're going to come up and
[50:22] see you and I I uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
[50:25] uh-huh uh-huh I don't know what's the
[50:27] attraction in the South but I know that
[50:28] there's not a lot of Attraction up
[50:31] north most of them are waiting for a
[50:33] millennial
[50:35] reain but brother Mark bless your heart
[50:38] now we brother Mark and sister Tina came
[50:41] to visit us this year and we were just
[50:42] so happy uh that we could have some
[50:44] fellowship again and and when we came
[50:47] back I don't know what they all paid you
[50:49] all that came on the bike trip the other
[50:51] day but brother Ron I had some of the
[50:53] finest Fellowship while we were biking
[50:55] around the mountains brother Gustaf
[50:56] where are you at sir that was just some
[50:59] of the I tell you what you you can't
[51:02] even do that in a coffee shop that was
[51:04] just some good and God bless you have
[51:06] you got your Bibles tonight I hope so
[51:10] why don't we stand
[51:12] together Luke turn over to Luke chap 11
[51:15] if you would
[51:17] and Luke the 11th
[51:23] chapter when we're done reading this
[51:25] we're going to pray and you pray for me
[51:26] that God would give me just what we have
[51:28] need of tonight and and know when's
[51:30] enough is enough
[51:32] and Luke 11 starting at verse one and it
[51:37] came to pass that as he was praying in a
[51:39] certain place when he ceased one of his
[51:43] disciples said unto him Lord teach us to
[51:46] pray as John also taught his disciples
[51:50] and he said unto them now why don't you
[51:51] know why don't we just say this together
[51:54] and he said unto them them when you pray
[51:58] say Our Father which art in heaven
[52:01] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[52:05] thy will be done as in heaven so in
[52:08] Earth give us our day our daily bread
[52:12] and forgive us our sins for we also
[52:15] forgive everyone that is indebted to us
[52:18] and lead us not into temptation but
[52:21] Deliver Us from Evil and I think the
[52:23] last part of that says for thine is the
[52:25] glory Glory forever and ever amen God
[52:28] bless you Saints you can have your
[52:30] seats I want to take one little portion
[52:33] out of that uh out of that scripture and
[52:36] I would like to pull out that last
[52:37] little portion in verse two it says thy
[52:40] kingdom come thy will be done as in
[52:45] heaven so in Earth and if I was going to
[52:48] put a a title of any kind to my thought
[52:51] tonight uh I wan to I want to title my
[52:54] thought tonight my ways are not your
[52:59] ways and then if I could put a subtitle
[53:01] behind that I'm going to just say this
[53:04] it's not all about
[53:07] you I know that's hard for us to
[53:09] comprehend in lady OA that it's not all
[53:12] about us brother Johnny what happened to
[53:14] you last time I was here you were
[53:15] sitting right up here brother Ron did
[53:17] you scare him off I
[53:20] did it's not all about you brother
[53:23] Johnny is not the way isn't that isn't
[53:25] that hard for us to comprehend in this
[53:27] world though somehow in our little life
[53:30] and all the uh you know the pressures
[53:32] and not just the pressures the spirits
[53:33] that have have taken over lady oia
[53:36] somehow we have come to a conclusion of
[53:39] some kind that life is all about me and
[53:43] everything is seems to have to revolve
[53:45] around me and and if it doesn't revolve
[53:47] around me then something's wrong but but
[53:49] let me just say it this way one more
[53:51] time tonight let this stand as a record
[53:54] that it is not All About
[53:57] You Now let me now let me build on that
[54:00] tonight not that it shouldn't be but let
[54:02] me build on that tonight because God's
[54:03] ways are not our ways his ways are
[54:08] different and when we get to you know
[54:10] brother would say this you know God's
[54:12] like a he's like a great drama
[54:14] producer and you know if we would say it
[54:17] like this you know brother Bram tells us
[54:19] that before there was a world and before
[54:21] there was a moon and a stars and before
[54:23] there was even a universe that we were
[54:26] there then he he he actually asked job
[54:28] job where were you when I laid the
[54:30] foundation of the world and the sons of
[54:32] God shouted for Joy I don't know about
[54:35] you but I was there then I was one of
[54:37] those sons of God that shouted for Joy
[54:39] but can I just brother R can I just use
[54:42] a a h h maybe can I just dramatize just
[54:45] for a moment if I if I could just get
[54:47] started just for a moment you know what
[54:50] what if while we were shouting for Joy
[54:52] listen you never had any idea about your
[54:54] birth you never had any idea that you
[54:56] were going to come down to a place
[54:58] called Earth there wasn't even one made
[55:01] you never had an idea that that you
[55:03] would be found in lady OA you and I were
[55:05] sons of God shouting for joy we were
[55:08] just enjoying the presence of God
[55:10] enjoying the glories of of whatever it
[55:13] was that we've forgotten about now but
[55:15] but listen what if Papa God would have
[55:17] stood up at that time and and he said
[55:20] and he would have said children gather
[55:21] around you know I got something I I want
[55:23] to share with you and I I want to tell
[55:25] you about something I I want to put
[55:28] together a drama and you maybe don't
[55:30] understand what a drama is but but
[55:32] listen I want to give each of you a a
[55:34] part to play and and I want you to play
[55:36] it well and and you know we'd be sitting
[55:39] there as children of God what is your
[55:41] very tonight your very heart if God
[55:44] would come to you and he would speak to
[55:45] your heart you might be in prayer saying
[55:47] Lord Lord I what do I do about this
[55:49] situation or Lord can I go talk to
[55:51] somebody Lord can I can I share can I
[55:54] share the gospel with with somebody and
[55:55] the Holy Spirit comes and talks to you
[55:57] and that day you meet that person you
[55:59] know that's a Divine appointment you
[56:01] know father set that up and you can
[56:04] hardly wait to get out what God's put on
[56:05] your heart all right let's jump back
[56:08] before the world began for a second and
[56:10] here's Papa God and he's got this great
[56:12] drama he's going to that he's going to
[56:14] he's going to begin to play out and he
[56:16] and he and he begins to talk about the
[56:17] different
[56:19] parts and he would say now listen Mark
[56:21] when you get you know I'm going to put
[56:23] you right there's going to be somebody's
[56:25] going to have to play a part right at
[56:27] the very end of this great drama and and
[56:30] I'm looking for somebody to play this
[56:31] part and and you know what you're going
[56:33] to have to it's not going to be an easy
[56:35] part brother Mark it's listen I'm I'm
[56:37] telling you son there's going to be some
[56:38] hard things that you don't understand
[56:41] but are you willing what would be the
[56:43] first thing you would say if if he if he
[56:45] would have put it out if Papa God would
[56:47] have put it out this way and said who's
[56:48] willing which one of us wouldn't have
[56:50] jumped up and said I'll take it I'll
[56:52] take it I'll do it right

[58:04] God's Own Heart a man that could could
[58:06] get into the channel of God and the
[58:07] spirit of the Lord could could flow
[58:09] through him and he begins to speak he
[58:10] says oh Lord thou H has searched me and
[58:13] known me thou knowest my downsitting and
[58:16] my Uprising thou understandest my
[58:19] thought a far off thou compassest my

[58:43] he's he's thrilled with the presence of
[58:45] God listen to the statement he makes
[58:47] such knowledge is too wonderful for me
[58:50] to know that you'll never leave me and
[58:52] you won't forsake me and Lord you've got
[58:54] my best interest at heart listen he says
[58:57] such knowledge is too wonder it's it's
[58:59] high I cannot attain unto it now watch
[59:02] verse seven whe shall I go from thy
[59:05] Spirit here's the question whether shall
[59:07] I go from thy Spirit or whether shall I
[59:10] flee from thy presence if I Ascend into
[59:12] the heavens now catch this tonight
[59:14] church if I Ascend into the heavens Thou
[59:17] Art there and we can all say amen yeah
[59:21] Lord we believe that but now watch the
[59:23] Revelation that David
[59:25] has cuzz the same God that was with him
[59:28] is with you
[59:29] tonight he says but if I make my bed in
[59:33] hell
[59:35] behold Thou Art
[59:38] there what a
[59:40] consolation what a consolation for
[59:42] whatever we're going through tonight
[59:44] whatever we're going through today you
[59:46] know Psalms 13 David would you know
[59:50] we're we're I'm just going to use the
[59:51] flip I'm I'm going to flip back and
[59:53] forth you know here's David rejoicing in
[59:55] the presence of God but not every day is
[59:58] going to be a sunny a bright sunny day
[1:00:00] and the lake is calm and and you know
[1:00:02] the wind is at your back and the fish
[1:00:04] are that's it's not every day can be
[1:00:06] that way God's placed us here with a
[1:00:08] purpose to mold character in our lives
[1:00:11] and there's only a there's certain ways
[1:00:13] that God does this and so now let's jump
[1:00:15] to Psalms 13 for a minute and David is
[1:00:17] in a totally different position in his
[1:00:20] life I don't know how far this goes or
[1:00:22] how you know what time frame this is but
[1:00:25] you and I know by experience that that
[1:00:27] things can change in a moment and if you
[1:00:29] don't if you haven't forgotten just go
[1:00:32] back to 2020 for a moment when
[1:00:34] everybody's lives got turned upside down
[1:00:36] at least over in communist Canada listen
[1:00:39] Psalms chapter 13 here's David when his
[1:00:41] life has changed completely and and
[1:00:43] things have gone wrong and and and he
[1:00:45] begins to he begins to cry out in his
[1:00:47] heart and he says how long will thou
[1:00:49] Forget Me Oh Lord forever the same man
[1:00:53] brother Ron that was just proclaiming
[1:00:56] come on Church how many times you're
[1:00:58] you're rejoicing Sunday morning and and

[1:01:19] finished telling us that that Lord it
[1:01:21] didn't matter if I made my bed in hell
[1:01:23] you're going to be there and now he's
[1:01:25] questioning Lord do you even know who I
[1:01:27] am do you remember me come on this book
[1:01:31] is written for a reason I mean it don't
[1:01:34] just talk about all the glory of every
[1:01:36] man it talks about the downfalls it
[1:01:38] talks about our shortcomings and it's
[1:01:40] there to bring us courage church he says
[1:01:43] how long shall I take how long shall I
[1:01:45] take counsel in my soul having sorrow in
[1:01:48] my heart daily how long shall my enemy
[1:01:50] be exalted over me consider and hear me
[1:01:54] oh Lord my God lighten mine eyes lest I
[1:01:57] sleep the sleep of death lest mine enemy
[1:01:59] say I Prevail against him and those that
[1:02:02] trouble me rejoice when I am
[1:02:05] moved but I've trusted in thy mercy and
[1:02:08] my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation
[1:02:11] I will sing unto the Lord because he has
[1:02:13] dealt bountifully with me what is it
[1:02:17] this is the same man this is the same
[1:02:19] man that that that that just we could
[1:02:22] say in days and moments in in months
[1:02:24] maybe in years whatever but things don't
[1:02:26] always stay the same church things don't
[1:02:29] always stay the same and and I I'm
[1:02:31] saying this to remind you that God's
[1:02:33] ways are not your ways we just we just
[1:02:36] finished praying Lord let thy will be
[1:02:39] done as it is in heaven so on
[1:02:44] Earth well he's got a Heavenly plan he's
[1:02:47] got a Heavenly plan that's got to be
[1:02:49] played out and you and I are part of the
[1:02:51] plan tonight now listen David the same
[1:02:53] man would come to a spot that he would
[1:02:55] become so heavy in his Spirit whatever
[1:02:58] whatever position he was in he become so
[1:03:00] heavy in his spirit and just cuz you're
[1:03:02] down doesn't mean that God's not there
[1:03:05] listen David would begin to in in in in
[1:03:08] in this great groaning in his in in his
[1:03:10] Spirit he'd begin to he'd begin to cry
[1:03:13] out my God my God why H has Thou
[1:03:16] forsaken
[1:03:17] me well you know that wasn't
[1:03:20] David we know that actually that was the
[1:03:23] spirit of God ing through David and then
[1:03:26] the very same Spirit would God himself
[1:03:28] when he was hanging there on the cross
[1:03:30] he would himself cry out God why have
[1:03:32] you forsaken
[1:03:35] me so if that same spirit is living in
[1:03:38] you
[1:03:39] tonight then you shouldn't be all worked
[1:03:41] up you shouldn't you shouldn't be
[1:03:43] distraught when things don't feel good
[1:03:46] because this message never came to
[1:03:48] assure your feelings of your salvation
[1:03:51] this message came to assure you that God
[1:03:53] keeps his word
[1:03:54] and that what he started he's going to
[1:03:56] finish and the work that he begun he
[1:03:59] will finish it Lord I I want to I don't
[1:04:03] want to be found with my lip hanging on
[1:04:04] the ground stumbling over it but I want
[1:04:06] to rejoice in these things Hallelujah
[1:04:09] you know we we can look and I'm Lord
[1:04:12] help me to to to get to where I need to
[1:04:14] go tonight but you know we can look
[1:04:17] God's ways are not our ways and and here
[1:04:20] you know here the very Christ Jesus
[1:04:23] Christ himself that the very God of
[1:04:25] Glory the Bible would say he would come
[1:04:27] to his own now I want us to catch this
[1:04:29] tonight church he would come to his own
[1:04:32] and as he would begin to pour himself
[1:04:34] out remember they were looking for a
[1:04:36] king they were looking for a king they
[1:04:39] were looking for the god of creation to
[1:04:41] come down and the truth of it was when
[1:04:43] Jesus stood there and he began to break
[1:04:45] the bread and he began to uh you know
[1:04:47] change water to wine and the Dead begin
[1:04:49] to be raised and they literally begin to
[1:04:51] call on him as king hosana The King
[1:04:55] hosana The King they were looking for a
[1:04:58] king for a new kingdom to come and they
[1:05:00] thought that he was going to that that
[1:05:02] kingdom was going to officially be there
[1:05:05] then they were excited listen Church
[1:05:08] they were excited finally they were
[1:05:09] going to they're going to rise up above
[1:05:11] their Roman captors and and they were
[1:05:13] going to be the people of God again and
[1:05:15] a and a Godly King was going to lead
[1:05:17] them but Watch What Happens cuz your
[1:05:21] ways are not God's ways and your
[1:05:23] thoughts are not God's thoughts and they
[1:05:26] were under expectation for him to become
[1:05:28] king and the Very King that was coming
[1:05:31] brother would say this God would blind
[1:05:34] their eyes God's own children he would
[1:05:37] oh church I hope you catch this tonight
[1:05:40] he would blind their eyes to do what to
[1:05:43] bring in a gentile bride to bring in
[1:05:46] people like you and I brother on he
[1:05:48] would take in blood God's ways are not
[1:05:51] your ways and his thoughts are not not
[1:05:54] your thoughts there's no way you would
[1:05:56] have done that there's no way I would
[1:05:58] have done that but God Almighty he had a
[1:06:01] purpose and he had a he had a thought in
[1:06:02] his mind and and the vision of God was
[1:06:05] to bring in a gentile bride and that
[1:06:08] would make listen who would do that to
[1:06:10] your own your own children the ones you
[1:06:12] love we wouldn't do that church we
[1:06:15] wouldn't do it in our Humanity but God
[1:06:18] had a greater plan Hallelujah he was
[1:06:22] going to redeem a people from every
[1:06:24] Kindred and every nation and every
[1:06:26] tongue and she was going to love him not
[1:06:29] because she was forced to love him she
[1:06:31] was going to love him because that
[1:06:33] something inside of her and something
[1:06:36] inside of her fell in love with him
[1:06:38] hallelujah praise the
[1:06:40] Lord he literally would have to Blind
[1:06:43] their eyes the same here's his own
[1:06:46] children that would begin to call a call
[1:06:48] on his death begin to call him a be
[1:06:52] begin to you know they they stood there
[1:06:54] and called for his own
[1:07:00] blood let his blood be on
[1:07:03] us be on our
[1:07:06] children it doesn't make sense brother
[1:07:09] Ron it doesn't make
[1:07:12] sense but God's ways are not our
[1:07:18] ways you know we can we we can just jump
[1:07:20] we could just jump some 2,000 years just
[1:07:24] just jump right down here into the into
[1:07:26] the 1900
[1:07:28] century and what they proclaimed with
[1:07:31] their
[1:07:32] voices here's the Jewish people and
[1:07:35] pretty soon the Germans and Italy and
[1:07:38] and you know all these different we got
[1:07:39] Hitler and miscellania we got all of a
[1:07:41] sudden the pressure begins to come on
[1:07:44] what's God
[1:07:45] doing he's running his children home but
[1:07:49] the very same ones that said let his
[1:07:51] blood be on us and our children and our
[1:07:54] children's children brother Ram would
[1:07:56] say and here Here Comes an ikeman and a
[1:07:58] Hitler and 6 million Jews I think they
[1:08:01] slaughtered him like you blood running
[1:08:05] everywhere and then he would say and
[1:08:06] every one of them received a white
[1:08:10] robe God's ways for what brother Mark
[1:08:15] for you because we're here church
[1:08:19] because of a gentile bride he didn't
[1:08:21] have to do that but because he wanted a
[1:08:24] gentile he wanted not just a Jewish
[1:08:26] bride he wanted a gentile
[1:08:28] Bride for 2,000 years now we look around
[1:08:31] us even now here Israel is being
[1:08:34] tormented and
[1:08:35] bombarded you know they still hate the
[1:08:38] world hates Israel why because they're
[1:08:40] God's
[1:08:42] children and yet he loved you he loved
[1:08:46] me you know brother Brandon would say
[1:08:48] this the tender hand yes of Jehovah he
[1:08:54] the tender hand of
[1:08:59] Jehovah if that was the tender hand of
[1:09:03] Jehovah running his children home
[1:09:05] through persecution through hardships
[1:09:07] through through trials that that you and
[1:09:10] I can't even hardly comprehend how much
[1:09:12] more is the tender hand of Jehovah
[1:09:15] leading your life guiding your life and
[1:09:18] when things don't go the way you thought
[1:09:20] remember this is not all about you when
[1:09:23] it don't go the way you thought remember
[1:09:25] that God's ways are not your ways
[1:09:29] hallelujah hallelujah Isaiah 55 would
[1:09:32] say this for my thoughts are not your
[1:09:35] thoughts and neither are your ways my
[1:09:37] ways sayith the Lord for as the heavens
[1:09:39] are higher than the
[1:09:41] earth so are my ways higher than your
[1:09:44] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
[1:09:48] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[1:09:49] from Heaven returneth not thither but
[1:09:52] WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth
[1:09:54] in Bud that it may give seed to the S
[1:09:57] and bread to the eater so shall my word
[1:10:00] be that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[1:10:04] shall not return unto me
[1:10:08] void Hallelujah it shall Brothers I
[1:10:12] don't know about you but my God he can't
[1:10:15] lie my God he can't lie he can't change
[1:10:18] his mind and he can't lie listen it
[1:10:20] shall
[1:10:22] accomplish that which I please now
[1:10:24] listen to this and it shall
[1:10:27] prosper and it shall prosper in the
[1:10:31] thing where where to I sent
[1:10:35] it really in the
[1:10:38] hardships in the struggles in the
[1:10:43] trials in all the hardships that God
[1:10:45] puts us through and still somehow that
[1:10:49] word in you is going to prosper you're
[1:10:52] here here's your pastor speaking to you
[1:10:53] just before I get up here and he said
[1:10:55] listen you were part of that word then
[1:10:59] and now here you are as an attribute a
[1:11:01] manifested Son of God word of God
[1:11:04] attribute of God manifested in the 21st
[1:11:07] century it shall prosper I'm not talking
[1:11:11] about money church I'm talking it's
[1:11:13] going to bring to pass what God has put
[1:11:15] it here for Lord that's what I'm
[1:11:18] interested in the rest God will take
[1:11:21] care of Psalms the Bible says that the
[1:11:23] Lord will not cast off his people
[1:11:25] neither will he forsake his inheritance
[1:11:27] you know listen here's a I'm thinking
[1:11:30] back to Israel again and all these and
[1:11:32] I'm thinking about these six million
[1:11:33] Jews and you find them in Revelations
[1:11:36] chapter 6 what is it white robes given
[1:11:38] to all of them every one of
[1:11:41] them because our ways are not God's ways
[1:11:44] now let me just let me just bring this
[1:11:45] just a little closer to home tonight
[1:11:47] Lord help me not to be too long you know
[1:11:49] we we we we we we we we get in the
[1:11:51] scriptures and we we get to read reading
[1:11:53] and I don't know about you but this is
[1:11:55] our
[1:11:57] Lifeline this is our Lifeline we deem it
[1:12:00] more essential than our daily bread are
[1:12:01] we better anyhow because your daily
[1:12:04] bread it'll run out in about three hours
[1:12:06] but two words out of this will keep you
[1:12:08] running all day that's a reality now
[1:12:12] listen you know we look we look at the
[1:12:14] scriptures and we begin to read about
[1:12:16] Solomon you here we are in a kingdom
[1:12:18] that's falling apart now and and more
[1:12:20] and more we begin talking about brother
[1:12:22] dway it can hardly wait for the body
[1:12:24] change we can we can we're starting to
[1:12:25] groan we're starting to cry we're
[1:12:27] starting to actually Express Lord I want
[1:12:30] out of here not just us old people no no
[1:12:32] young men young women are saying oh I
[1:12:34] can hardly wait is it almost over
[1:12:37] lord we begin to look and and our heart
[1:12:40] our hunger is is the reality that we we
[1:12:43] came from in the beginning was
[1:12:44] Perfection we want to go back to that
[1:12:47] and so when we get in the scriptures we
[1:12:49] begin to we begin to looking at this
[1:12:50] great man Solomon and brother Brown
[1:12:52] would say you know Solomon had a kingdom
[1:12:54] that that that that to this point we we
[1:12:57] realize it was a a shadow of what is to
[1:12:59] come but but there Solomon had a kingdom
[1:13:02] that that there was no Wars and there
[1:13:04] you know everybody was in Harmony and it
[1:13:06] was it was beautiful and and the whole
[1:13:08] the whole Kingdom prospered it was under
[1:13:11] the hand of God and the and the whole
[1:13:13] Kingdom began to prosper now let me just
[1:13:15] let me just give you a little a brief if
[1:13:17] you would Brothers First Kings chapter 4
[1:13:20] I'll just give you a little brief of
[1:13:21] what what Solomon's day life look like
[1:13:25] you know this whole world the whole
[1:13:27] American dream is to have a have a life
[1:13:29] like this a Canadian dream too by the
[1:13:31] way First Kings chapter 4 and Solomon's
[1:13:34] provision for one day listen to this
[1:13:36] Solomon's provision for one day was 30
[1:13:39] measures of fine flour three score
[1:13:41] measures of meal 10 fat oxen 20 oxen out
[1:13:45] of the pastures 100 sheep besides hearts
[1:13:49] and robu and follow deer and fatted fowl
[1:13:52] for he had Dominion over all the region
[1:13:54] on this side of the river of tisva even
[1:13:56] unto aah uh over all the kings on this
[1:14:00] side of the river and he had peace on
[1:14:01] all sides around about him and Judah and
[1:14:05] Israel dwelt safely every man under his
[1:14:08] Vine under his fig tree from Dan even
[1:14:10] unto beers Sheba even all the days of
[1:14:13] Solomon wow can hardly
[1:14:17] wait I don't know what it's like to have
[1:14:19] you know three consecutive good months
[1:14:21] in a row
[1:14:24] just the way life is
[1:14:26] right I mean about the time you get
[1:14:28] comfortable you just expect change
[1:14:31] expect
[1:14:32] change but listen we look at Solomon we
[1:14:35] and we think of the glory that God was
[1:14:37] trying to express in a natural carnal
[1:14:41] man now my question is but how did
[1:14:45] Solomon get
[1:14:46] there this man that is that that would
[1:14:50] type
[1:14:51] Christ the coming Prince the coming king
[1:14:54] of a new kingdom that's that for a
[1:14:56] thousand years there's not going to be
[1:14:58] any death no sorrow perfect peace there
[1:15:01] it's going to
[1:15:03] prosper how did he get here how did
[1:15:06] Solomon show
[1:15:08] up now remember God's ways are not your
[1:15:11] ways how do how did Solomon show up what
[1:15:15] brought Solomon on this Earth I mean God
[1:15:18] predestinated him to be on this
[1:15:21] earth now watch how God brings it to
[1:15:26] pass you see his ways are not your
[1:15:29] ways here's this a great king called
[1:15:32] David a man after God's Own
[1:15:34] Heart a man after God's Own Heart who
[1:15:37] literally loved the Lord he loved the
[1:15:39] presence of God his his whole being was
[1:15:41] set to do the will of
[1:15:43] God here he is a a you know he he
[1:15:46] battled out half his life and now he's
[1:15:49] King and and you know he's got he's only
[1:15:51] got 500 wives brother on 500
[1:15:56] wives and one day he just happens to be
[1:15:59] walking on the
[1:16:02] wall and he begins to look over the wall
[1:16:04] in his kingdom and you know he begins to
[1:16:06] look down come on the Bible says the
[1:16:10] footsteps are the Righteous are ordered
[1:16:12] by God and we don't understand the end
[1:16:16] you only know today I only know today
[1:16:20] and David begins he looks down and
[1:16:22] there's a woman having a shower down
[1:16:24] there and she's dressed probably less
[1:16:26] than most of the women in in America
[1:16:28] right
[1:16:29] now he stops for one
[1:16:34] moment well we already know what his
[1:16:36] problem
[1:16:37] was 500
[1:16:40] Wives come on let's just be
[1:16:45] real okay so that wasn't the that wasn't
[1:16:48] the bad part that he sto well sh hold on
[1:16:50] let me say it right I mean he stopped
[1:16:52] and looked he didn't he wasn't condemned
[1:16:54] for
[1:16:55] that the problem was I I suppose maybe
[1:16:58] he checked his time and the next day he
[1:17:00] made another round found out it was the
[1:17:02] same and and and one thing led to
[1:17:04] another pretty soon we have this man of
[1:17:07] God this
[1:17:09] King and he begins to talk with this
[1:17:11] young lady and he begins to uh something
[1:17:14] in his heart begins to to pit or patter
[1:17:16] in a way it shouldn't listen she's a
[1:17:18] married woman she's off limits she's off
[1:17:21] limits he's a king he can have any
[1:17:23] virgin he wants she is off
[1:17:26] limits we're talking about God's ways
[1:17:28] are not your ways come on Brothers it's
[1:17:31] not I want to say this it's not all
[1:17:32] about you it's not all about you here's
[1:17:36] David God had a plan that no but David
[1:17:39] didn't understand God's plan listen here
[1:17:42] he comes and now all of a sudden he
[1:17:43] starts this relationship you know with
[1:17:45] bash Sheba and here it's his best man
[1:17:48] Uriah one of his one of his great
[1:17:50] Fighters it's his wife
[1:17:53] yeah and David to to to bring more shame
[1:17:57] upon everything here I I mean David
[1:18:00] doesn't just take her H you know as his
[1:18:02] own wife but but he brings Uriah in and
[1:18:04] has him
[1:18:07] killed it it don't make sense God's ways
[1:18:10] are not our ways he's predestinated a
[1:18:13] Solomon to come why wouldn't he just
[1:18:15] bring it you know just righteous and
[1:18:17] godly and and holy and everything would
[1:18:20] just be just right but God gets no Glory
[1:18:23] out of everything just right church God
[1:18:25] gets Glory out of making things just
[1:18:28] right
[1:18:30] hallelujah it's hard it's hard for us to
[1:18:33] understand how anything good could come
[1:18:35] out of this here's David's got a you
[1:18:38] know here David's got another man's wife
[1:18:40] pregnant now he takes the man and gets
[1:18:42] him killed so you know everybody's
[1:18:44] always trying to cover for themselves
[1:18:46] don't you just love that we're shame on
[1:18:48] us but that's the kind of people we are
[1:18:50] man you do something wrong and you'll
[1:18:51] squirm and you'll twist and you'll paint
[1:18:53] a picture to you know to try and make it
[1:18:55] look this way and you'll tell people
[1:18:57] this so it kind of looks this way and
[1:18:59] God's looking down and he sees the
[1:19:01] reality of it and your heart knows the
[1:19:03] reality of it it don't matter what you
[1:19:05] tell people it don't matter what you
[1:19:07] what picture you present God knows and
[1:19:09] you know David knew he was in the wrong
[1:19:12] David knew he had made a mistake David
[1:19:14] knew it should never have happened in
[1:19:16] walks a prophet Nathan begins to tell
[1:19:18] him this story about you know about this
[1:19:20] sheep and the and the rich man and his
[1:19:22] sheep and how he had somebody coming and
[1:19:24] how he took the poor man sheep and David
[1:19:26] gets all self-righteous and says hey
[1:19:28] that man's going to pay for his sin he's
[1:19:30] going to
[1:19:31] die Nathan looks him right in the face
[1:19:33] and says David you're that
[1:19:38] man
[1:19:41] why
[1:19:44] why cuz God's ways are not your
[1:19:48] ways and his thoughts are not your
[1:19:53] thoughts if he's going to bring
[1:19:55] something to pass he's going to bring it
[1:19:56] to pass the way he ordained for it to
[1:19:59] come to pass
[1:20:02] Hallelujah the good part about David is
[1:20:04] when he was when he was confronted with
[1:20:06] him
[1:20:07] immediately he fell on his face and
[1:20:10] repents
[1:20:15] Hallelujah God loves to take things that
[1:20:17] look all wrong and make them
[1:20:20] right make them right
[1:20:24] you know sometimes we come up against
[1:20:25] things in our own lives and things that
[1:20:28] we can't understand we just seem to
[1:20:30] can't wrap our heads around it and we
[1:20:32] ask the question why
[1:20:36] why I just want to read this quote out
[1:20:38] of the message of Shalom brother BR says
[1:20:40] this many times people ask why they ask
[1:20:43] some sometimes they ask me why why must
[1:20:45] these things happen what why why did
[1:20:48] this happen to me or why did I start and
[1:20:50] this happen and I had this trouble here
[1:20:52] and this upset me and I lost this here
[1:20:55] sometimes I've asked why here's brother
[1:20:57] Brown saying sometimes I've asked why
[1:20:59] when I was a young Minister first
[1:21:00] started out did God take my wife right
[1:21:03] out from under me take my baby right out
[1:21:04] from beneath me right beneath my heart
[1:21:07] why why did he do that I didn't know I
[1:21:12] do now I just held my hand in his come
[1:21:17] on church and kept trusting
[1:21:20] him when we can't understand it and our
[1:21:23] question is why just keep your hand in
[1:21:26] his and keep trusting him it'll be it'll
[1:21:30] it'll come out sooner or later
[1:21:33] amen you know I I think sometimes we get
[1:21:35] in situations and and things happen in
[1:21:38] our homes and in our churches and and
[1:21:41] immediately it doesn't matter uh there's
[1:21:43] got to be somebody somewhere that will
[1:21:45] point a finger and try to condemn it you
[1:21:48] know there was lots that could have
[1:21:49] pointed their finger at David we would
[1:21:51] have pointed our finger at David let's
[1:21:53] just be honest we would have pointed our
[1:21:55] finger at David and we probably would
[1:21:56] have condemned
[1:21:58] him but God
[1:22:01] didn't God
[1:22:04] didn't now the Bible says in in St John
[1:22:07] chapter n there was a there was a man
[1:22:09] that was born
[1:22:10] blind there's a man that was born blind
[1:22:13] and and if you keep reading down in the
[1:22:15] scripture you find out that that the
[1:22:17] question was well why is this man
[1:22:21] blind
[1:22:23] why is this I mean let let's just bring
[1:22:25] it home like it would be today you know
[1:22:27] we we don't much preach to the
[1:22:28] Pentecostals and the Baptists we preach
[1:22:30] to message people and and so everything
[1:22:32] that we look at is that something
[1:22:34] happens oh it must be because of that oh
[1:22:36] if that happens well then it must have
[1:22:37] been because of that and we always want
[1:22:38] to make our assumptions and our
[1:22:40] predictions and our you know we're so
[1:22:41] quick right and and so the people would
[1:22:44] say well they would come to him and say
[1:22:45] listen the reason he's
[1:22:47] blind is there there must his mom and
[1:22:50] dad must have done something wrong they
[1:22:52] must have done something wrong Brothers
[1:22:53] can you mute me for one second thank
[1:23:01] you God bless
[1:23:03] you but the scripture says
[1:23:06] this it says that when Jesus was
[1:23:10] asked he said neither has this man
[1:23:13] sinned nor his
[1:23:17] parents but that the works of God should
[1:23:20] be made manifest in
[1:23:24] him sir well he must have sinned and
[1:23:27] that's the reason he's in this position
[1:23:28] he must have you know it's got to be God
[1:23:30] coming down and and and smiting him
[1:23:33] because of something he's done secretly
[1:23:35] no it's not that at all we need to get
[1:23:37] rid of that kind of thinking God has a
[1:23:40] plan for us yes if you've sown you're
[1:23:42] going to reap there's no question about
[1:23:44] but that's not that God's not going to
[1:23:45] condemn you on that listen that
[1:23:48] sometimes things happen good things ha
[1:23:50] bad things happen to good people I just
[1:23:53] say that bad things happen to good
[1:23:54] people and we don't understand we can't
[1:23:57] make it work in our minds but God has a
[1:24:01] plan and if we ever lose sight of the
[1:24:03] fact that God is in control of this
[1:24:06] we've lost everything church then we
[1:24:08] might as well eat drink and be marry and
[1:24:10] tomorrow we die because if what good is
[1:24:12] it going to do us listen God is in
[1:24:15] control of our everyday life if you are
[1:24:18] a new creature in Christ then my
[1:24:20] scripture says that your footsteps are
[1:24:22] ordered by God the very breath you
[1:24:24] breathe is God given to you and he's
[1:24:27] absolutely ordained a path for your life
[1:24:31] Hallelujah all
[1:24:33] right so sometimes bad things happen to
[1:24:36] good people and I want to say it this
[1:24:38] way brother Browner makes a little I'm
[1:24:40] reading a quote here tonight brother
[1:24:42] Browner has a a woman show up in the
[1:24:43] prayer line that's got I think diabetes
[1:24:46] maybe or something let me just look back
[1:24:47] for a second here
[1:24:50] uh yeah she's got she's she had
[1:24:52] something bad on her her ankles and she
[1:24:54] she's been walking with high blood
[1:24:56] pressure and let me just go to this and
[1:24:58] he says he he begins to State he says
[1:25:01] now dear heavenly he goes to pray for
[1:25:02] this woman he says now Brothers have you
[1:25:04] got that can you throw that up he says
[1:25:06] now dear heavenly father our beloved
[1:25:08] sister stands here yet a young woman but
[1:25:13] Satan would give her a stroke if he'd uh
[1:25:17] if he could and he'd lay her up yonder
[1:25:19] on the bed of affliction he'll put her
[1:25:22] out of commission if he can now watch
[1:25:25] what he says for he don't want her
[1:25:29] testimony why did this happen to this
[1:25:31] Christian why we would question or those
[1:25:35] are those who would not understand but
[1:25:37] father we know that it was For Your
[1:25:39] Glory oh I hope we could just catch a
[1:25:42] reality of that tonight whatever
[1:25:44] position you're in it's for his glory
[1:25:46] let's just remember this it's brother
[1:25:48] Dwayne I I I just can't see it it
[1:25:50] doesn't matter what you see tonight it's
[1:25:52] for his glory listen he said he said one
[1:25:56] time uh who sinned this boy or his
[1:25:58] mother and you said neither but that but
[1:25:59] that the works of God might be made
[1:26:01] manifest we believe that for our sister
[1:26:04] this morning we believe that's the
[1:26:06] reason her ankles God in that condition
[1:26:09] we believe that's the reason the high
[1:26:11] blood pressure struck her so that you
[1:26:13] could show her your love and kindness to
[1:26:19] her your ways are not God
[1:26:23] ways his thoughts are higher than my
[1:26:27] thoughts so we
[1:26:29] believe that reason the high blood
[1:26:32] pressure struck her so that you could
[1:26:34] show her your love and kindness to her
[1:26:38] that you could prove to her that you're
[1:26:41] the Jehovah who heals our diseases
[1:26:45] Hallelujah isn't that beautiful what
[1:26:48] kind of testimony ought we to have
[1:26:49] tonight Church you sick tonight you're
[1:26:51] not yeah things are going wrong you know
[1:26:54] uh what kind of testimony ought we to
[1:26:56] have we ought to be able to get up every
[1:26:59] morning put our hands in the air you
[1:27:00] know stand up by our bed and say thank
[1:27:02] you Lord for healing me amen amen here
[1:27:07] we're sitting here tonight I'm going to
[1:27:08] just go on this little thought for a
[1:27:10] little while longer here that God's ways
[1:27:12] are not our ways and and you know it's
[1:27:15] not all about you we're sitting here
[1:27:17] tonight at the end of the ages we're on
[1:27:20] the brink right now if I could I just
[1:27:22] say how I feel I believe that Time and
[1:27:24] Eternity is Blended I already believe
[1:27:26] it's Blended we've already been caught
[1:27:27] into Heavenly places in our spirits and
[1:27:29] our bodies just got to catch up there
[1:27:31] comes a time when everything is done the
[1:27:33] consummation is over we stepped into
[1:27:35] that other dimension and it's finally
[1:27:37] complete but even now even now we're
[1:27:39] sons of God even now we're sons of God
[1:27:42] we're sitting here today and and for
[1:27:44] years now your pastor's been preaching
[1:27:46] from the open book from the open book
[1:27:50] that God would come and that he would
[1:27:52] literally come down and break the seals
[1:27:54] of in the back of the book and begin to
[1:27:56] to pour out his heart and his mind to
[1:27:59] his
[1:28:00] childrenall and we're enjoying
[1:28:02] revelation after revelation after
[1:28:04] Revelation we're walking from Glory unto
[1:28:06] Glory from Glory unto Glory we're
[1:28:08] enjoying it all but Church how did that
[1:28:11] book get here amen how did that book get
[1:28:13] in this
[1:28:15] book let me tell you how it got in this
[1:28:17] book here's a man some 2,000 years ago
[1:28:20] by the name of John who had one time was
[1:28:22] a zealot who who one time was he was so
[1:28:25] on fire for the kingdom of God that that
[1:28:27] when somebody disagreed with him he's
[1:28:29] like should we call fire out of heaven
[1:28:30] and and should we have it consume them
[1:28:33] and the Very God that he was worshiping
[1:28:35] looked him in the face he said you don't
[1:28:36] even know what Spirit you're
[1:28:39] of but now watch after the trials and
[1:28:42] the struggles and the troubles and and
[1:28:44] here the Bible says you know John would
[1:28:47] be he he become a
[1:28:49] pastor and because that he gone through
[1:28:52] so much and he gone through you know had
[1:28:54] so much wisdom let me just refer to you
[1:28:56] brother Ron I'm going to put you as John
[1:28:58] tonight you know been through so much
[1:29:02] and had so much life experience and so
[1:29:04] much struggle and so much trial had he
[1:29:07] had gone through and he actually had an
[1:29:08] understanding and he could literally get
[1:29:10] down to where the people live help them
[1:29:12] through their troubles and you know
[1:29:14] brother Brown would say this John you
[1:29:15] know John the people loved him so much
[1:29:18] that they would come to him over and
[1:29:20] over and if he had a phone it would rang
[1:29:22] constantly he was busy you know as a
[1:29:25] pastor doing a p but
[1:29:28] listen if he would have stayed being a
[1:29:30] pastor and just gone about his daily
[1:29:33] taking care of his sheep This Book of
[1:29:35] Revelations would never have been
[1:29:38] written one day God was like John I need
[1:29:41] your attention and so John in order to
[1:29:44] get your attention I'm going to do
[1:29:46] something that you're not going to
[1:29:47] appreciate you're not going to like I'm
[1:29:49] literally all of a sudden one day
[1:29:50] there's a knock on his door
[1:29:52] door here stand some Roman soldiers this
[1:29:56] humble Meek Pastor the same one that
[1:29:58] would would would call fire out of
[1:30:00] Heaven is now saying Brothers love one
[1:30:02] another fervently love each other Above
[1:30:05] All Things love one
[1:30:07] another most so mellowed out by all of
[1:30:10] the struggles of life and now here he is
[1:30:14] in his old age and now there's a a knock
[1:30:16] on the door and there Roman soldiers
[1:30:18] standing there and they haul him off for
[1:30:21] what what did he do what had he done
[1:30:24] wrong only tried to help God's children
[1:30:28] haul them off to a to an island listen
[1:30:30] Church it wasn't like jail today where
[1:30:33] they give you three Square meals a day
[1:30:35] where somebody like brother John would
[1:30:36] make sure you were fed and you were
[1:30:38] watered and you had a good bed to sleep
[1:30:40] on no no no it was serpents and
[1:30:43] scorpions and rocks and and caves and
[1:30:46] and God's son God's God's child Lord
[1:30:49] what are you doing h I I mean John went
[1:30:53] from his nice cozy bed to a to a rock
[1:30:56] pile and and and and Lord what are you
[1:30:57] doing and I got criminals around that
[1:30:59] want me dead and they're out of their
[1:31:01] minds and Lord what what's going on here
[1:31:04] listen we don't know how long that that
[1:31:06] John had this turmoil and oh no now what
[1:31:09] and and what what what's tomorrow going
[1:31:11] to bring and can I sleep with can I
[1:31:12] actually go to sleep tonight or do I
[1:31:14] have to keep my eyes open and somebody
[1:31:15] going to kill me and listen we don't
[1:31:19] know listen Church John was not on the
[1:31:23] island for John's
[1:31:24] sake John was on the island for your
[1:31:27] sake and for my sake cuz this book never
[1:31:30] got open till this time
[1:31:34] Hallelujah yes sir listen it wasn't all
[1:31:37] about
[1:31:38] John matters of fact none of it was
[1:31:40] about John he might have the devil might
[1:31:42] have come to him and said oh God what
[1:31:44] did I do Lord how did what did I do
[1:31:46] something wrong he might he might have
[1:31:48] checked every facet of his life and went
[1:31:50] back it wasn't about John
[1:31:52] it was about making sure that the word
[1:31:54] of God would be it would be hidden away
[1:31:56] that the revelation of God would be
[1:31:58] given so that a bride in the last day
[1:32:01] could literally have it given to her so
[1:32:04] she could take the same book and eat
[1:32:06] it Hallelujah God's ways are not our
[1:32:11] ways listen Psalms 138 says this the
[1:32:14] Lord will perfect that which concerneth
[1:32:16] me amen the Lord will perfect that which
[1:32:20] concerneth me the Mercy oh Lord endure
[1:32:23] thy mercy endureth forever forsake not
[1:32:25] the work of thine
[1:32:27] hands
[1:32:28] [Music]
[1:32:29] hallelujah it's not all about you John
[1:32:33] would have had the same question Lord
[1:32:34] why
[1:32:36] why but God was working something
[1:32:39] greater out oh don't never lose sight of
[1:32:42] the greater picture of
[1:32:46] God how many were at the beginning of
[1:32:49] the service how many's hands would have
[1:32:50] gone up and said Lord I'll I'll do that
[1:32:52] I I'll volunteer
[1:33:01] Lord you know one day
[1:33:04] Jesus he was out in a
[1:33:07] boat this Runner comes running up to him
[1:33:11] master I have a I have a message for
[1:33:13] you it's from my
[1:33:16] master and he's you know he's he's going
[1:33:18] to have a great feast and he wants you
[1:33:20] to come would you
[1:33:23] come I can see Jesus say tell your
[1:33:25] master I'll be
[1:33:27] there you know the little Runner goes
[1:33:29] running
[1:33:32] back days go by and pretty soon the
[1:33:34] feast day begins to come we know the
[1:33:37] story Jesus shows up at the
[1:33:41] feast walks
[1:33:44] in nobody acknowledges
[1:33:47] him we're talking about a king of glory
[1:33:52] we're talking about my
[1:33:54] king nobody acknowledges
[1:33:57] him nobody gets down take and clean his
[1:34:01] feet nobody gives him the time of
[1:34:04] day but somewhere back up yonder or down
[1:34:07] the street a little ways is a little
[1:34:11] woman listen Jesus didn't come to
[1:34:15] Simon's house it wasn't about Jesus
[1:34:18] coming to Simon's house for Simon's sake
[1:34:22] it wasn't the fact that brother Ron he
[1:34:24] could mix he could rub shoulders with
[1:34:25] some of the finest preachers in the
[1:34:27] world it'd be a good a good ministerial
[1:34:29] convention and we could all be there
[1:34:30] together and you know I could Jesus
[1:34:33] didn't come for
[1:34:35] that he didn't come so that he could you
[1:34:38] know cozy up with Simon and and and
[1:34:41] somehow fit into their great organiz he
[1:34:42] didn't come for
[1:34:45] that he didn't come to have his feet
[1:34:47] Washed by
[1:34:50] them he he didn't come to put on their
[1:34:53] nice
[1:34:55] robe or their nice perfume that they
[1:34:57] should have perfumed with he didn't come
[1:34:59] for that
[1:35:00] sake it wasn't about Simon and it wasn't
[1:35:03] about the rest of the ministry that was
[1:35:05] there it wasn't about the nice house and
[1:35:08] the nice food and and the wine and and
[1:35:10] whatever the conversation might it had
[1:35:12] nothing to do with any of
[1:35:14] that why because God's ways are not your
[1:35:18] ways if Simon only would have recognized
[1:35:21] IED if he only would have recognized how
[1:35:25] put out he was when he saw this little
[1:35:27] woman that had this bad reputation if he
[1:35:30] would only have been willing to
[1:35:31] sacrifice what that little woman
[1:35:33] sacrificed to get in the presence of
[1:35:36] Jesus Christ do you know that that God
[1:35:38] that Jesus literally forfeited all of
[1:35:41] that just for one woman for one woman
[1:35:45] that had no
[1:35:47] reputation for one woman who had spent
[1:35:49] all that she had for one little little
[1:35:51] Alabaster
[1:35:53] Box he gave it all
[1:35:56] up he never came for anybody else other
[1:35:59] than
[1:36:01] her just so that his word could be
[1:36:05] fulfilled listen God's ways are not our
[1:36:09] ways why would he do that I don't get it
[1:36:13] church I don't understand why would this
[1:36:16] God come this very one who could have
[1:36:18] spoke a world into existence while he
[1:36:20] was there the very one who who who who
[1:36:23] raised the dead and gives sight to the
[1:36:24] Blind and knowing that they were calling
[1:36:27] him for to degrade him to make him
[1:36:29] little and why would he do
[1:36:32] it because there was a seed there
[1:36:35] because there was a seed there and he
[1:36:37] lit listen Church we're looking at a man
[1:36:40] that that's rubbing shoulders in the
[1:36:41] world and the dirt of the world's on him
[1:36:43] and his garments are filthy by the world
[1:36:46] stepped out of the portals of Glory to
[1:36:48] to to shed his Robes of glory and put a
[1:36:51] garment like yours and mine to go and
[1:36:54] redeem his
[1:36:57] own oh but we live in lady
[1:37:00] oia you know how we would have done it
[1:37:02] brother Ron we would have ran we would
[1:37:04] have got into town I'm going to run into
[1:37:06] you know Phoenix I'm going to find out
[1:37:08] where the best Motel is I'm going to
[1:37:11] make sure that when I get there that I
[1:37:13] can hand the valet guy my keys he can
[1:37:15] drive my car off make sure that somebody
[1:37:17] notices while I'm getting in and
[1:37:20] out because we think it's all about us
[1:37:24] we think it's all about
[1:37:26] us but Jesus don't work that way Jesus
[1:37:29] don't work that way
[1:37:32] Hallelujah the same God would cross the
[1:37:35] Seas to a man who is literally out of
[1:37:38] his
[1:37:40] mind if he could cross the Seas to reach
[1:37:42] him what about you and I
[1:37:46] tonight you know sometimes things happen
[1:37:49] in
[1:37:50] life and we don't like
[1:37:52] it but how do you
[1:37:55] know except that God has allowed that to
[1:37:59] transpire in your life and now he used
[1:38:02] that to push you out of your little
[1:38:04] comfort zone the place that you have
[1:38:06] loved for so long and been so
[1:38:08] comfortable at and now all of a sudden
[1:38:10] it's gone and Lord now what do I do and
[1:38:12] now I begin to panic and I don't
[1:38:13] understand and he'll use that in your
[1:38:15] life to assure you that I will never
[1:38:19] leave you he'll use that in your life to
[1:38:21] make sure well brother Dwayne you don't
[1:38:24] understand you know I can't even afford
[1:38:26] to pay my next bill but he can listen he
[1:38:29] promised he he'll never leave us and nor
[1:38:30] forsake us he's still the god that knows
[1:38:32] where there's a fish where there's a
[1:38:34] coin in a fish's mouth he knows just how
[1:38:36] to take care of it just trust him just
[1:38:38] trust him
[1:38:41] Hallelujah though I walk through the
[1:38:43] valley of the shadow of death I'll fear
[1:38:45] no evil I'll fear no evil you know we
[1:38:49] look at we look at Great men like like
[1:38:51] Moses I'm going to I'm going to ask the
[1:38:53] musicians come I'm going to try and just
[1:38:54] get closed here we we look at a great
[1:38:57] man like Moses you know predestinated by
[1:39:02] God
[1:39:03] himself to lead a
[1:39:06] people out of is out of
[1:39:11] Egypt you know wouldn't it just made
[1:39:13] more sense just to let him come in as a
[1:39:17] great
[1:39:17] warrior it wouldn't have made more sense
[1:39:20] just to just bring a whole army with him
[1:39:22] and just take out Egypt and what do you
[1:39:25] think would happen then brother Ron you
[1:39:27] know we're so human that as soon as
[1:39:29] something I hope this is all right I
[1:39:31] hope this is all
[1:39:33] right you just let the spirit of the
[1:39:35] Lord move one time somebody comes to get
[1:39:37] prayed for in your
[1:39:38] church and you have the blessing of
[1:39:40] praying for that person watch God
[1:39:42] supernaturally heal him it's pretty hard
[1:39:44] not to think that you had something to
[1:39:46] do with that isn't
[1:39:48] it because we're prone to think it's
[1:39:51] it's about us it's nothing to do with
[1:39:53] you nothing to do with you your hands
[1:39:55] are his hands your feet are his
[1:39:58] feet Hallelujah here's
[1:40:02] Moses now here's this great
[1:40:06] man is that
[1:40:09] strange God would bring a great man like
[1:40:12] Moses he's trained him
[1:40:15] up Mo from a child he understood that he
[1:40:19] was supposed to be a deliverer
[1:40:22] you know what his problem
[1:40:24] was he was
[1:40:27] unregenerated he had a
[1:40:29] temper he had a temper
[1:40:33] brother that temper was bad enough that
[1:40:35] it killed a man one
[1:40:40] day
[1:40:42] God would use a man like
[1:40:46] that a man that would have a temper and
[1:40:49] that would murder somebody go God would
[1:40:50] use somebody like that oh yeah yeah
[1:40:53] because his ways aren't your ways his
[1:40:55] choices aren't your
[1:40:57] choices you would have fixed you would
[1:40:58] have picked somebody
[1:41:00] better but God
[1:41:02] Specializes in things that we think are
[1:41:06] impossible
[1:41:10] Hallelujah you know that now just watch
[1:41:13] watch the
[1:41:16] picture what did that one what did the
[1:41:20] murder of that one man cause in Moses's
[1:41:26] life it caused him to run off into the
[1:41:30] Wilderness and
[1:41:33] there God could begin to deal with
[1:41:36] them oh yeah yeah sometimes God's got to
[1:41:40] get you on the backside of the desert
[1:41:42] somewhere he's got to take you out
[1:41:44] yonder and talk to you like a
[1:41:46] man listen brother Bram says he said he
[1:41:49] knows every Junction he knows know the
[1:41:51] how the Rhythm must be when it must take
[1:41:52] a place he knows what it takes to mold
[1:41:55] you he knows what kind of material he's
[1:41:58] going to use see the backside of the
[1:41:59] desert sometimes where God molds
[1:42:02] righteous men into sages and
[1:42:07] Prophets that's where men are beat
[1:42:11] outed he says men are be outed in the
[1:42:13] word when they get all kind of creed and
[1:42:15] stuff listen we don't need to worry
[1:42:17] about Creed and stuff we need to worry
[1:42:19] about stuff that's called uh uh not
[1:42:22] Creed what is it what's the word I'm
[1:42:25] looking for hey not Creed and Dogma no
[1:42:28] you just run a church long enough and
[1:42:30] you know pretty soon it becomes a
[1:42:31] tradition that's the word I'm looking
[1:42:33] for we don't worry so much about Creed
[1:42:35] and Dogma that's we we deal with that
[1:42:38] too our problem is we get into tradition
[1:42:41] culture message culture message
[1:42:44] traditions instead of a living God
[1:42:47] living in his people hallelujah God will
[1:42:50] take you out on the back side of the
[1:42:52] desert somewhere to get your attention
[1:42:53] yes sir listen he says that's where men
[1:42:55] are beat out men are beat out in the
[1:42:57] word where they get all kind of creed
[1:42:58] and stuff in them let them come to the
[1:43:01] word and God beats it right out of them
[1:43:03] molds them right into this great
[1:43:05] Symphony which of his word see and they
[1:43:07] say the word the word moving on God
[1:43:10] knows when the rhythm of it has got to
[1:43:12] change he knows how the rhythm of it
[1:43:15] goes I don't know how it goes but he
[1:43:18] knows how it
[1:43:19] goes Hallelujah
[1:43:21] many are the afflictions of the
[1:43:22] righteous but God delivers them from
[1:43:25] them all
[1:43:28] hallelujah

[1:47:43] story and we're so thrilled the angel of
[1:47:45] God comes in and and he and he breaks

[2:03:02] sea oh
[2:03:06] God sometimes all of these things that
[2:03:09] come across our path in what we call the
[2:03:13] path of life sometimes we don't
[2:03:16] understand sometimes we wonder and we
[2:03:19] get so self-concerned and why me why me
[2:03:24] on the ash sheep why why my family my
[2:03:27] kids why my camels and you've destroyed
[2:03:31] everything and oh God you call that
[2:03:36] love have you considered my servant
[2:03:43] job why did you throw Joseph in
[2:03:47] prison
[2:03:51] why did you take him away from his
[2:03:54] Brethren from a father that loved
[2:03:58] him why did he
[2:04:02] suffer God it doesn't look like you're
[2:04:05] fulfilling your
[2:04:11] word and yet father every
[2:04:14] step was ordained until one day it
[2:04:19] wasn't

[2:04:50] you Lord you did it for a
[2:04:55] purpose and here I I couldn't see it
[2:05:00] because it didn't look right because
[2:05:03] your
[2:05:04] ways are above my ways your thoughts are
[2:05:09] above my thoughts who would have ever
[2:05:14] thought that you would take the weakest
[2:05:16] of all people in the worst of all
[2:05:21] ages and called them a
[2:05:24] bride
[2:05:26] hallelujah oh
[2:05:28] God
[2:05:31] bless father thank you Jesus we didn't
[2:05:34] call
[2:05:35] ourselves the prophet said if you'd have
[2:05:37] given yourself the choice to choose you
[2:05:41] as a son or daughter you wouldn't have
[2:05:43] done it why because you know
[2:05:45] yourself you know your faults your
[2:05:48] failures
[2:05:50] and yet God his ways are so far above
[2:05:53] your ways his thoughts thank you Jesus
[2:05:57] so why I can Rejoice here stand behind
[2:05:59] this Pulpit it's not because of me it's
[2:06:02] not because of something I've done it's
[2:06:04] not because I kept the word it's because

[2:06:11] promise mountains and
[2:06:14] seas all of these things were for a
[2:06:17] purpose I thank you tonight for this

[2:12:23] rang the bell and we wanted to thank God
[2:12:25] praise the
[2:12:28] Lord and I told her today I said
[2:12:31] sometimes your second chance is so much
[2:12:34] better than your first
[2:12:36] one you know we all need a second chance
[2:12:40] that's what Calvary was for thank you
[2:12:44] Lord let's just bow our heads dear
[2:12:46] heavenly father
[2:12:48] I certainly
[2:12:50] was just reminded once
[2:12:54] again how your ways are so
[2:12:57] much greater than
[2:13:01] ours and how all the
[2:13:04] bad it's actually for the
[2:13:08] good if we could just look past the
[2:13:13] situation and the pain and the suffering
[2:13:15] that comes from with within the the
[2:13:19] trial and you could realize and have
[2:13:21] faith and confidence that on the other
[2:13:23] end of this it's for something it's for
[2:13:27] a purpose it's for a
[2:13:31] person oh
[2:13:35] God I know that my me personally I just
[2:13:38] feel like the closer I get to to you I
[2:13:42] don't worry about things I just have
[2:13:44] confidence Lord knowing that you provide
[2:13:47] all things
[2:13:49] and it's just an it's just a normal
[2:13:52] thing for me to trust in you I just
[2:13:55] can't help it Lord I it's not about me
[2:13:58] it I remember the the very scripture the
[2:14:01] steps of the righteous are word of the
[2:14:03] Lord I when I first came back to you
[2:14:05] Lord you showed me that it wasn't that
[2:14:08] the steps of the righteous were always
[2:14:12] righteous but they were ordered by
[2:14:16] you and we heard about that again
[2:14:19] tonight Lord and I started even thinking
[2:14:22] of Stephen who would want to get
[2:14:25] stoned but the prophet said he didn't
[2:14:27] even feel a
[2:14:29] stone but in his death Lord there was
[2:14:32] someone
[2:14:34] there you could just take about every
[2:14:37] story Lord and realize that there was
[2:14:40] someone
[2:14:41] there that benefited from the
[2:14:44] pain and the suffering Lord help us Lord
[2:14:47] Lord to
[2:14:48] yield and to not live
[2:14:52] selfishly help us to be present Lord to
[2:14:55] be aware of the needs around us Lord to
[2:14:58] not live for ourselves but to live for
[2:15:00] others Lord the disciples asked you one
[2:15:03] day how can we love
[2:15:06] you he says when you love one another
