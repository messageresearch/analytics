everything like that and I took three or four different videos well there was never any singing recorded I went back and looked but there was singing there was singing there was something Supernatural happening Supernatural happening and U you know I was very very sick and uh the nurse he came back in he said do you see people in this room I said there's people all through this room I did I saw them they were there but their faces were obscure to me so I knew that I wasn't crossing over otherwise I'd recognize him oh hey brother so and so brother you know shake their hand everything so but uh he I said there's there's how many know that we are encompassed by such a cloud of witnesses you're not alone hey they're just another dimension and and so it was in that song there and and so when I hear that I my mind goes back to that thank you all for helping out for the memorial service for brother Mike Patterson I would have liked to have been here but uh it just worked out that I I was unable to and so I want to thank all of the staff and the different ones here that work the deacons brother Steven and and everything to orchestrate it and that they didn't have anything uh the Patterson family didn't have to do anything just come and and and have the memorial service and and I want to say how proud I am of all of you for doing that and and helping them out so um sister Sandy and I flew to Houston as you all know we flew to Houston uh we rented a car and uh it started raining in Houston and rained all the way up to bont that's an hour and a half Drive hour and 40 minute drive and we got there and and uh you want to know why they have such green grass and so many trees huh you got to have rain you got to have moisture and so you want to know why everything's so Brown here and why we have cacti instead of trees it's because it doesn't rain that much we're in a different uh ecosystem in the area but praise the Lord anyway uh we spent the night there in Bulma the next morning we drove about 30 minutes north to a little city that we help Pastor a little group of people there in Silsby Texas and uh understand it's been 42 years 42 years since we had done that so we drove around trying to find our old house and what you do when when if you haven't been somewhere in 42 years it changes okay and you go back and wow where where was the old lumber yard cuz we we live next to the lumber yard and and so anyway we finally asked somebody said well now it's over uh it used to be and now it's just kind of a storage area that's it and I said well if if I know where it's at I'll be able to find our house so we found the house that we lived in 42 years ago and our our kids didn't remember but I told them I said that's the the house we lived in that when that cop was chasing me and had his red lights behind me I said we outran him and run into the uh that's how my kids remember oh that house yeah I'm not going to tell you the rest of the story but he never caught me and and I was a bad influence I repented to my kids at that time but it was just a headlight and I knew he was going to try to pull me over for a headlight cuz I had just replace the headlight because back there they got gravel roads with and how many of you have had to replace a broken headlight uh I mean that happens back there on gravel roads out here when was the last time he replaced the headline you don't do it for years you'll you'll buy a new car before you replace it anyway anyway so uh I repented and and my kids they they know better to outrun a police officer um

into our heart Lord encourage us according to your word Lord tonight may just anoint each and every one of us Lord and sanctify one again our mind our heart that you may have preeminence tonight Lord we want to say we thank you we appreciate you Lord we thank you Lord for for the revelation of your word that establishes Lord according to to the Revelation you've given for us Lord God may your name be glorified Lord once again tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen so thank you musician God bless you all so we will go directly to the word of God tonight and I believe believe that this is our purpose is to worship and to magnify the word tonight so I would like you to turn with me in the Book of Job uh two portion of scripture so in the Book of Job and we can see the Book of Job that is uh we can found it before the book of Easter and uh Ezra and Nehemiah and we know that God put this scripture in chronological order amen so isra and nayah which is types of the restoration and the Book of Easter and we can see that after the restoration Easter was being revealed which is our type in this last days so after the revelation of Easter there comes the resurrection then the book of PS which is the new song so the Book of Job so this is not uh we can say Resurrection or Easter messages and we know that the resurrection is everyday Resurrection amen Book of Job chapter 19 verse 25- 27 so it says for I know that my redeemer leaveth amen so it is a positive confession I know I not hoping I am not doubting but I know and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worm destroyed this body yet in my flesh I shall see God Amen whom I shall see for myself personal revelation I don't care what anybody else see amen but it is his personal revelation when I shall see for myself and my eyes Shall Behold and not another though my Reigns be consumed within me so re means Eternal organs remember that how Lazarus body went into Decay prior to Resurrection so job here has received a revelation of that Resurrection notice that he had a Confident come into him in that he knew that he had power within him that would Quicken and raise his body I know my redeemer leaveth so in the Book of Romans chapter 8 uh verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you yeah he that rais up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and may the Lord add a blessing upon the reading of his word and we want to know of a certainty of what the even is that we have the same Spirit dwelling in us that raise up Jesus am because that will also bring us confidence that our mortal bodies will be changed in this hour and put on immortality and the message of the hour made known to us that day amen so we will go back in the Matthew chapter 28 the last chapter of Matthew chapter 28 with the title in your Bible the rest resurrection of Jesus Christ and the event of that day and we know that he is the same yesterday today and forever whatever happened then is still happening now because there is always a pattern so the title is the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the event on that day so we will start in Matthew chap 28: 1-2 in the end of the Sabbath at it began to Don toward the first day of the week I don't know if I already preached this but if I did thank you it's all right the scripture say verily verily I say unto you so my title tonight is the quickening power so we need quickening power tonight amen to keep us on fire I know the cold weather is coming in but we need fire amen we can we need quickening power in the end of the Sabbath as it began to D toward the first de day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the simple C and we know if we can type it today after the Sabbath which is after the seventh day after the seven Church Ages come the first day amen which is the eth day which is the Eternal day amen and the first one that receive or see the resurrection was Mary Magdalene and Mary which women types the church and Christ has his church amen and church mean eclesia the callout one so the first one that recognize the resurrection are the cold out ones so this message the 8 Day message is the message that will return back where we came from amen amen so the message of the hour doesn't put us into another denomination but the message of the hour point back to where we came from just like Jesus Christ I came from God and I'll go back to God this is the message of the hour so why the first one that meet or see the resurrection was the Church of the Living God denomination cannot see it but the bride will see it in the last days amen and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and sat upon him if there is an angel descended during the time and roll back the stone of the tub in order to reveal Christ there is a descending angel in our day that roll back the seal in order to reveal Christ and he is no seal and who is no seal Christ no seal that is being revealed in our day hallelujah what a mighty revelation of this three women Hallelujah so notice the first thing that happened as part of the resurrection of Christ there was women an angel descending amen very good then the second one Jesus Christ himself appear then the third part there was a commission go and tell my disciple it is the same thing happening today the mighty angel came down with the message of the hour then he himself reveal unto his bride then there is a commission take the book and hear it thou must prophesy again our prophesying is a prophetic Ministry amen We Don't Preach about do this and do that do this and do that we preach about who we are because if you don't know who you are you cannot act according but if you know who you are you can act accordingly and the message of the hour reveal to you who you are you are Sons and Daughters of God you need to believe it because we have the message directly addressed to each and every one of us so three things so that is in the way in the early days a message churches receive Revelations of the Resurrection that's why the Revelation is Sovereign sometimes God reveal it and sometimes others later on so that creates a lot of commotion even in the disciples they they don't believe the report of Mary and mag Mary and Magdalene and Mary they don't believe the report in this last day it take the Lord Jesus Christ himself to reveal the word we cannot convince one another that there is a message of the hour but unless God himself reveal it to you you can never understand the message of the hour it is the grace of God in this last days he is going to reveal himself to you look at Thomas he he refused to believe the testimony of the 10 disciples because we have also met an angels in these last days so he is the one that's going to reveal himself so that no one can get Glory out of this message of the hour all glory belongs to God if we preach we are just a messenger nothing else Hallelujah so in the message the Easter seal he said look at the Millions on Earth that didn't receive it when Jesus was here Millions he's speaking about Millions didn't even know that he was here can we say the same today millions of people didn't know the message of the hour the prophet was sent he was gone and no one knows what is happening look at the Millions on Earth that didn't receive it when Jesus was here so remember the the evidence is connected with receiving the word of your day that is what he is talking about about but how thankful that we should be this morning to know that we have the direct evidence and the Bible proof we need to be thankful we have a direct evidence and Bible proof that we are included in that great Resurrection morning coming that great Easter morning he's speaking of the great Easter of the day of the resurrection of the seven Church ages of the sleeping Saints yes this Resurrection this greatness has already begun it started within a people that on the earth now by the revelations of the word of that hour the resurrection started with you and I what is it it is Christ making himself known again to the believer of the ages seeking out his own sheep that will hear his voice he said we have the earnest of it right now in our mortal bodies we have the earnest in our mortal bodies the predestinated ones are the first of course to be quickened when the Holy Spirit comes to claim its own and how does he claim its own by revealing himself personally to his elect in his age Hallelujah this message is directly for each one of us to the predestinated seat can we think of something else but to praise God Amen than Lord if you have something to thankful to be thankful to be grateful it is the message of the hour to let you know who you are even though how poor we are whatever situation we are in letting you know that you are part of him is enough to say Thank You Lord is enough to be grateful sir for out of millions of people we are the chosen one at his resurrection he said that we have the earnest of it right now in our mortal bodies the predestinate one on the first of course you are the first before he reveal himself to others he reveal himself first to his elected and we have the evidence in our molter body when we receive the quickening power we become a new Creator in Christ we are no longer who we are but we become a new Creator in Christ but Satan is always accusing us you are this you are that you are this you are that but he is accusing you of your past he don't recognize your present at the present you are a new Creator in Christ Jesus covered by his blood and whatever accusation he had in you God don't listen to it anymore because God see his blood Co this is what he's doing right now he's claiming You and I by revealing his word to us and the word is a sin so turn it be in the Book of John in the Book of John we can read it he is an eagle and the eagle anointing in the Book of John you cannot read about Parables you cannot read about prophecy but in the Book of John it is always present tense amen he said all things that the father had are mind it was was a direct message no more prophecy no more history no more Parables it was revealed all things that the father had are mind whether you believe it or not but the Bride of Jesus Christ believe it therefore I said I who you going to believe the report it is he himself speaking revealing himself that he shall take of mine I shall show it unto you in other words reveal the secret of the word to you that is what he has done doing a little while and ye shall not see me his physical body you can no longer see his physical body and again a little while and you shall see see me yes because I go to the father a little while you shall not see me you will not see his physical body and again a little while and ye shall see me and this seeing is understanding but now you will understand him by the way he revealed himself according to his word not in the physical body but by the revelation of his word we can see Christ to the word in this last days in John 14 verse 18 He said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you do you believe it so we are not widower we have a husband amen who promise I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yes a little while and the world see me no more but ye see me he's talking about another way of seeing which means understanding because I live you shall live also and at that day ye shall know at that day you shall know you will know and you need to know this is the message of the hour even though you don't like it you will know and you need to know this is the Revelation time he couldn't be in them in the form of Jesus of Nazareth but he could be in them in the form of the revelations of the word which is what he has always from the beginning because in the Book of John he said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh am and dwelt among us he was the word first and a word really is just a thought being expressed and so the thought of God became the word of God and the word of God became fleshed and dwelt Among Us in the form of Jesus of Nazareth but the same Jesus is not in the form of Nazareth today he is in the form of his bride because God was in Christ now it was Christ in many member body Hallelujah and the restoration back to the Garden of Eden restoration back hallelujah amen amen she'll be looking for God here is God sitting because God is a word a thought being expressed Satan will let you doubt it he tried to point you to your physical place how can you be God you commit this you commit that you commit this you commit that but it doesn't take away the realization the reality that you are God's because when the word of God comes to you you are God's because the word of God is being made manifest and we have a portion to fulfill we can create what we can create we can can create an atmosphere Hallelujah if you are sad if you're troubl if you're depressed if you an anxiety you recognize who you are and you can create an atmosphere to come down if you are sick you can create an atmosphere and say hallelujah the Lord God heal all thy diseases because Jehovah Gyra in the Old Testament the the the the seven compound name of Jehovah Jehovah Gyra Jehovah nessi Jehovah Shalom Jehovah Rapa is now made manifest in one person and that is the Lord Jesus Christ if you want healing is in the Lord Jesus Christ if you are deliverer it is in Theus Christ if you have Redemption it is in the person of Jesus Christ the seven compound name is now manifest in the name of Jesus that's why there is power in his name there is healing in his name there is Miracle in his name there is salvation in his name there is no other name given among men which can in which we can be saved in the name of Jesus Christ because the Old Testament that Jehovah of the Old Testament is now Jesus of the new so don't be confused as brother Ron preached we are the final voice to the final AGS God is relying on you and me because we are holding eternal life for others they may not be in the rupor but the way you act the way you deliver the word you can impart it the life to them because if you live the life of Christ they become hunger and thirst in their life to to become you and by doing so they are good to us they can give us water they can help us amen and it will give them eternal life they may not be in the rupture because the Bride is a special class of people but eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish that is the default because God is not willing that anyone should perish but come unto repentance God is so gracious but for the bride we are a special class of people in the Easter seal if we are ordained to be on the ground because we are born and come to the word speaking Lies We are not ordained to be an angel yes if you are ordained to be on the ground like the eagle walking in the chicken nest if you're ordained on that ground the holy spirit is here to find you he is here to find you and when he find you you Rec recognize the call there is the voice of God in the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound yes the mystery of God which you are part of will be revealed in these last days you know the hour you're living you know that these things are supposed to happen yes it's going to happen because now it is a prophecy yes and there must be a people to fulfill prophecy just like when he said Elijah I will send to you Elijah Elijah is a prophecy yes but there is also a people that will fulfill that prophecy the you in that prophecy is you are the people of the prophecy if there is a prophecy there must be a people to fulfill the prophecy and we are the Fulfillment of that prophecy whether you like it or not how come you can go along in the message of the hour we may have suffering we have so many issues in life but whether we like it or not whether we we we try to run away from it we cannot we are anchored we are quickened the quickening power Quicken that seed and whether we like it it will will manifest don't worry about the manifestation it will manifest whether you like it in his time and it season it will manifest

it will Quicken your soul forget everything around you keep on flying yes just keep on flying keep on flying and you will forget the things all around you because you are now sitting in Heavenly places the atmosphere of the presence of God Amen when you are sitting you are resting you are relaxing how can you relax when there are so troubl time well I am sitting in the promis of God and I'm relaxed whatever comes our way may this the economy or whatever comes our way we are now sitting in Heavenly places because we recognize the word of God that was sent in our day what is our purpose in this life because there is only three things that happen in his resurrection day here reveal himself and he had a commission go and tell my disciple that is our commission yes sir not to not to be a big time not to be a millionaire or billionaire our commission is to preach the gospel prophesy the gospel share the gospel even if you cannot preach just give some spoken word whatever you can do for the kingdom of God that is your commission you are not commission to become millionaires you become commission to be good in your career which is all all good but your priority is revealed after his resurrection he sent an Angel reveal his message and he himself reveal unto you then you have a commission Hallelujah and a fellowship with God through reconciliation he said and I said to friends across the world now when you go to when you go to look for me I will be listening to Angelic choir there's great voices the S is different one who will be singing in that time on the other side there will be a lot of singing yes that's why if you don't want to worship you will be disappointed that in that other side there will be a lot of worship a lot of singing That's why from then on you need to be in the spirit of worship because you will be disappointed during the time there will be a lot of voices a lot of singing a lot of worship good if you cannot sing just clap your hand if you can not clap your hand just just enjoy it the presence of the Lord because the presence of the Lord dwells in his people that is worshiping him whatever things you can do just to worship him to let him know that you appreciate what he has done for you he did it not today he did it before the foundation of the word and de one who will be singing in the time on the other side I sure love good singing is the prophet love good singing Do You amen when I was an unbeliever my voice is always Out Of Tune so all my friends they are good in singing guitars and everything but every time they we have a group singing I'm always on the other side because my voice is just like a chicken that is but when I got converted I don't care what my voice are I just want to worship Him Amazing Grace how sweet that sound Hallelujah I'm on the marching in I don't care what they say anymore I just love to worship Him Hallelujah as the prophets I sure love good singing but one of the greatest thing that I ever had enjoyment is meditation in the word of God that is the most important thing to meditate upon the word of God to me there's one thing that's fundamentally and one thing that's sure and one thing that's infallable that's the word of God right to me all Christian them must be based upon that one solid thing yes meditate upon his word the word of God that's the foundation that's what we're here for tonight is to Fellowship around his word and meditate upon God that's where fellowship with God takes place it is in the realm of your thoughts and his thought in Perfect Harmony am just like in the Book of Joshua chap 1:8 this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth and if we can bring it in our day yes this open book shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein at night listen to the tapes read the word of God day and night meditate Amen Let not this law the book of law the open book in our day let us the depart and just be a display and thou mayest observe according to all that is written therein for then thou shallal make thy way prosperous if you want to be prosperous meditate upon the word of God and this Prosperity is not like a financial Pro Prosperity you can say that but this Prosperity is the Revelation your relationship intimacy relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ we can prosper by the revelation of who he is and who we are we can prosper in our Revelation and then Thou shalt have good success we can have success success to overcome this trial success for anxiety success for and depression success for anything because you meditate on the Promises of the word of God and Paul said I can do all things through Christ the revealed word in this hour this is the time that we need to speak the word speak the word hallelujah claim your benefits you are the mouthpiece of God the don't listen to Satan he's just a block the more he say you are this you are that you say I know I do this and do that but I still I am a Son of God you have question with that bring it to him oh he always accuse you this one this one this one oh I know that you think I know that I know all about it but still I am the son of God what can you say about that you need to bring it back to him I am a Son of God how about you you are a son of pric but I am a Son of God hallelujah in the Book of Job he said verse 1 verse 6 now there was a day when the sons of God came to present them themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them he wants to join and the Lord said unto Satan whence comest thou and Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down to it people with no business is going from east to west and south nothing to do do he has nothing to do so he just room around goon here G up to another talk about somebody here talk about somebody there if you notice he's going to and fro without he is doing nothing until God tell him have you considered my my son job so every trial that comes our way it is with a perm Miss with God God know what he's doing and all way to to to build our character is to Tri he allow Satan to do that so in Eden God would come down in the cool of the day and walk with men and have fellowship with men upon the Earth amen he just came down and just fellowship with his sons and daughters that it's a good thing but there was but here we see Satan is among the son so we're trying to walk with them upon the Earth because he wants to be worshiped he wants to insert himself he wants to become somebody he wants to be a good preacher he wants to be a good Deacon he wants to be a good song leader he wants to be somebody in the church he wants to have fellowship with men and Pro object his thought into men and shap man's thinking to become submissive to his will and desire so that he can rule man's heart and control his thought and be the god of men and be worshiped by men is he doing it today unless you are Sons and Daughters of God you will give in to his plan that's why the the the the thought of men are evil continually in this last days that is insanity how can the thought think about evil things continually but here was a man named job that Satan could not walk upon the Earth and fellowship with his man with his thought nor could he project his thought into job to do evil against the Lord and then it is the season that job come to a realization of the quickening power within him Satan took away his family his business and everything even his skin but during that time the quickening power Quicken his I know my redeemer live it Hallelujah God I know my redeemer live it and he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and the thought after my skin W destroy his body yet in my flesh I shall see God whom I shall see for myself and my eyes Shall Behold and not together though my Reigns be consumed within me he has this great testimony Hallelujah am in Revelation chapter 1 verse 17 and 18 which brother Bram uh quote this when he preached the Easter seal Revelation 11:17 and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not I am the first and the last and I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death so a key is the revelation remember that J was asked who Am I who do you say I am and some say you are Jeremiah Jeremiah and it was personally as of Peter who am I to you he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God in in Matthew 11:17 and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon so Revelation is a blessing if you want blessing ask for Revelation because Revelation is more than anything else Simon vuna for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto you but my Father which is in heaven Revelation was given by God it was not even revelation of Peter himself because flesh and blood has not revealed it to you in other words it was not your Revelation Peter but my Father which is Ty of the Holy Spirit it was him who revealed to you for we in the spirit of God shall come he will guide you into alar in Matthew 16:18 and I say unto thee that thou art Peter Upon This Rock upon this Revelation I will build my church and the gates of bell shall not prevails again it and I will give unto thee the key of the Kingdom of Heaven I will give the the key the revelation of the kingdom of heaven and he said and whatsoever thou shal bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever shall lose on Earth will be loose in heaven the key of revelation will bind and will lose people if they reject or accept the message there is binding and there is loosing because Peter was commissioned he he was given the key to the kingdom yes of Christ and the preaching of the open book will bind those who will reject it and will lose those who accepted they will be loose in darkness they will be loose un belief amen so that's why Paul got said in in 18 but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other the gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse there will be a binding If You Preach another gospel If You Preach another Revelation outside of the revealed word of God let him be a curse and Paul repeated it verse n and we said before so I say now again yes if any man preach any other gospel any Revelation any interpretation man-made Doctrine unto you than that ye have received let him be a curse so the key of hell and death is a revelation that will given to a people in the last days because there is a promise that there would be a people on Earth in the last day that would not see them it is a promise Romans 8 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit that we can Quicken make alive it will change this Mortal into immortality yes quickening power is the key that unlock mortality to a people in this age the word Quicken is to cause to live that which was dead or to make alive or to give life OB seed Quicken into life germinating springing up growing so to Quicken the seed is to germatize it to Life by sun and water so they speak of process that take place cuz something to live to be quickened we need to lay in the presence of the son to be matured we cannot be matured in the light of the candle of the seven Church ages we are beyond the candle ages we are beyond the candle light we are now living in the Sun the rising of the Sun the rising of the Su to take away the greenness out of us amen so the spirit that will Quicken your moral body in this hour begins by the process of God shining the light of the word of this hour into the seed of what he plac Within You by predestination so we cannot get away for this predestination your destiny is already being prepared thank the Lord and whether we like it if we are predestinated we will align to the seed that was quickened in this last days in the message Easter seal continuing have I ever told you anything in the name of the Lord but what happened he said yeah I want to tell you about it every time has it been perfectly at the platform every time has it happened just like he said this was th set every time the prophet share uh share his vision it was always being fulfilled he fulfilled every promises he he he speaks about I stood there look over the time I seen tens and thousands of times thousand coming Young And Men Women running throwing their arms around me screaming I look back and see myself laying on the bed oh Lord let me look the past the curtain of time so is's sharing his experience beyond the curtain of time so there was a great Eternal youth meeting no old no Young no babies nothing because when her daughter Sheron was died she was just a little baby but when she saw it beyond the curtain of times she was already a te teenager yes and the old woman that he lead to Christ at the age of 90 when he saw it beyond the curtain of time he was a young people so if somebody tell you that he goes beyond the curtain of time and tell you that he saw an old man he saw a baby he didn't go behind the curtain of time because brother have been so any old men or babies and we know that the prophet is the yard stick of all that experiences no old men no babies only young people because when his daughter died being a baby he saw it as a young girl beautiful girl The Old Woman become a young girl that's why I always tell some of the brothers that the message found me at the age of 27 so I have never experienced what it was to be in the Youth Camp Fellowship but thank God we have a youth meeting Eternal youth meeting one of these days hallelujah so heaven we are going in is an eternal youth meeting the prophet met the Splendor of Youth when he crossed the Cur of time his account is the Y stick against which any claim of people who experience LL should be Jud that is ortic so let's continue on what is it the quickening power that will cat us away that the the great quickening power that's what I'm in Arizona for right now yes there's many people sitting here stood right here at penix and heard me tell you from this platform thus said the Lord and how many remember it now go something is fixing to happen amen I saw seven Angel come didn't Life Magazine pagot as a it floated across here 27 miles high 30 miles across that is not Fred Suman this other gin Norman them sitting back there stood right there when seven angels appeared right there on the hill he shook the hills for miles around like that he saw seventh angel and we know that the seventh angel was the Lord Jesus Christ himself the angel of the Covenant there stood seven angels and throw a sword in your hand and said go home and open the Seven Seals that are given and here they are the true mystery of marriage and divorce and serpent seed and all these things that's been fools about is thus said the Lord what it is the quickening power coming to the church making her ready this hour that we are approaching quickening power am hallelujah amen all these things that happening our generation it is for the purpose to give us the quickening power in is last days hallelujah quickening power coming to church making her ready this hour that we're approaching quick power he said oh God help us to receive it help us to believe it the same tonight help us Lord to believe it I know there are so many destructions when you open the YouTube that will go against the prophet but who are they the angel of the Lord when the prophet was still a little boy he said said don't smoke Don't drink don't nothing because I prepare I prepare something for you but this preacher who was once a drunkard a sinner will go against the prophet how can you go against the prophet when the angel of the Lord prepared his body for this ministry and God fulfilled everything in his ministry she just depend on what attitude you take to it whether it's going to do you any good or not though see you have to believe that you don't believe it it won't do you one bit of good amen hallelujah amen so it's up to you but I believe as a bride of Jesus Christ as the seed of God you will always believe the word if even though if you cannot understand it if you are a seed it will Quicken the quickening power will say Amen to every word of God because you will recognize Who You Are that's true just depend on what attitude you take whether he going to do you good or not though you have to believe that you don't believe it it won't do you one bit of good how Samuel stood there before the people and said have I ever told you anything in the name of the Lord but what happened did I ever beg you for your money to live on no but we want the king anyway that's the way the church is today they want their own ideas they want their own interpretation they want their own their group they want their own understanding they want somebody that will LIF them up higher and follow a man instead of follow the way the the word of the Lord they walk right around well it just go to show the quickening power is not there if you go around and say oh I am this I am that I am this I am that the quickening power is not in there because if the quicking power is that the son can do nothing with it himself but if that queening power is there you recognize like that little Eagle that he mama that's the word that said the Lord that's what God promised that's what was for told and that's exactly what happened we're Beyond any Shadow of Doubt potentially in the resurrection right now the S getting ready to be taken up in the air have you recognized it brother and sisters he said so maybe I'm just asking our musician to come I will just because of the sake of time I will just land was last quote did you in the message the Redeemer did you ever stop to think this morning as far as returning that is becoming invisible he's already here with us now don't look for him in the near future he is here right now how do you know he is here because the word is being preached the word is being revealed he said wherever two or three are Gather in my name I will be in your midst who do you think is preaching to you today the BL may be brother Mario but the word that come out it was God himself trying to Quicken you to his word don't look at the man look at the word the Lord Jesus is saying another word or another dimension right here today in the form of the spirit what a blessed people we are because he fulfilled what he promised I will be with you I will be your confor I will never leave you nor forsake you the Lord Jesus is in another world or another dimension right here today in the form of the spirit his spirit is blending in with our spirit our eyes can see him because they they're physical yet unless there would something happen happened that we could see Vision but he is here just as visible just as real as he was in the day that he spoke to Mary at the grave or he met C ofas on his road to the mayus his presence is here do you believe it amen it can be filled with that felt with that inner church that's on the inside of human body called the New Birth the soul has been magnetized unto him can we say amen hallelujah his spirit is now blending with our spirit that's why we recognize our day and our [Music] message we are now the loud year is now about to close [Music] and when you open the news it's all about why did Trump win in this election why did Trump win this election we know that Trump was elected as the 45th president and today he won as the 47th president in the US Constitution the 22nd amendment you can only run two terms his first term he was the 45th then comes Biden the 46th President we are not looking for a woman to run and waron as a president and many of the message circle is already being disappointed because what they are expecting that a powerful woman will arise but they didn't realize that prophecy was already fulfilled in Joe Biden a Roman Catholic president which is Joe Biden aligned with JF Kennedy with a vice president or maybe a vice president a woman president and during their nug he wore a purple C dress which fulfilled the six prophecy yes maybe a Roman Catholic President or a beautiful cruel woman yes isn't he so cruel yes he legalized abortion yes he legalized that a man can be a woman and a woman can be a man he legalized that a man can join the woman's Sports he confused the mind of the of the student you can choose what you want you want to be a cat you want to be an animal you want to they legalize all that a cruel woman and that fulfill the six Vision yes but now in this last days this election Trump won again the 47th president before Biden he was the 45 45th which is f which is a number of Grace Biden 46 president which is a number of 666 which is Roman Catholicism and this last Trump we have the last Trump the last [Music] term that's why in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 51 behold I show you mystery that we shall not sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trum at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise rais Incorruptible and we shall be changed the quing power is here to prepare us for this corruptable must push on incorruptible incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality we have the last Trump remember that Trump by just a little word that they stand God back it up and he won the election because he stand by the word of God just a little word and God back him up how about you the Bride of Jesus Christ you have the word in this last days if God back up thr to win then how about you the bride which is the word of God in this last day you have the word of God in this last day we don't say that this is the this is our sign but the prophet said in the message countdown whatever the achievement of this word is God is doing the same in his [Music] spiritual when they say peace and prosperity then sudden Destruction come isn't Trump saying we will restore America again again but we need to be careful this must be the last year before the going out we don't wait for that purple to manifest as a president because that is already past tense that is already history and we don't expect something now that Trump is the President we need to be careful maybe this is the time for us to go closer to God to go be here we don't expect that America to prosper again are you expecting prosperity in Trump Administration we are expecting for the body change because the quickening power was already given to us in order for us for this body to change from corruptible into corruptible and that purple was already fulfilled and the prophet said I think it is in the hidden life he said that every prophecy has a dual or a compound meaning we know that purple is a color of royalty Revelation chapter 17 but when I open the message at Thy word the purple also is a color according to the law of adoption is also a purple did you catch it or maybe not I want to repeat it again the purple is a compound meaning and Kamala Harris fulfilled the scripture but for the Bride of Jesus Christ under the adoption message after our children we are Hallelujah we are ready to be adopted because we talk about him we we act like him we talk like him and the father will will will request all bring the robe and that robe is the robe colored purple Rob at TH word maybe and when the boy proved to be right boy the message at Thy word which in our case is the holy spirit that takes word to the father and gives a report of what we do then if we be found faithful for so long like the child was then he was taken out in public square and a purple robe was put on him there was a law of adoption Hallelujah that is the law of adoption that the purple color parallel to adoption the law of adoption we are the adopted Sons and Daughters of God we are predestinated unto adoption that's why we speak like him we act like him we decide I like him and we say thank you Lord let us stand to our feet and may the Lord may the Lord encourage you the quickening power here is to Quicken us to prepare ourself we are not looking praise God for a better economy but we are looking for the changing of our body everything is ready for [Music] and the Victory of Donald Trump is just an indication that our time is too short amen God bless you let us pray for one another and encourage one another our time is too short we need to encourage another the time has come at the twigling of an eye amen those who are dead in shall rise first that we which are alive and remain shall be quickened from corruptible into corruptible the time has come when they see peace and prosperity be careful Hallelujah God bless you and God bless you brother Hallelujah Jesus your name is power Jesus Jesus your name is m Jesus your name will break heav strong Jesus your name one more time Jesus your name is Jesus your name [Music] Jesus your name will break every Jesus your name is amen I believe Brethren sisters that we are in the midst of fulfilling all prophecies coming to pass brother brandham says I see no other prophecy except for the coming of the Lord amen okay all of these things and if we see you know and again he said you know uh about hey is this the last Trump hey it may parallel right there but what we're looking for is the Trump of God not this Trump of man listen as much as you think it's a Salvation for America it's America's done for its history she's is going to go bankrupt therefore we're not putting our trust in and our hope in all of that huh no brother Braham said though the day of America is over so it's a time now there's a kingdom there's another kingdom coming okay and so praise the lord we have a kingdom that cannot be stopped it's coming and the prophet of God has come here and spoke and we have heard it and now all this stuff coming to pass we're not into all that political stuff we just love the word of God it's our absolute huh it's our staying power amen we're going to sing that song it's manifesting time the fruits are on the vine and the lovely one is coming in plain view brother BR said after I'm gone these tapes will get clearer and clearer he's not talking about removing the the back backround noise and the blue noise or whatever you call it no he's talking about you're going to catch these things and wouldn't God would not permit it to be done now but one day after I'm gone we're in that time and our Bible is becoming a new Bible the message is becoming clearer and clearer and what is it doing it's manifesting you say you got Revelation and there's no manifestation you only got knowledge we need to go beyond that and catch the revelation of who who we are amen the voice of myov he quickly come sweeping over the
