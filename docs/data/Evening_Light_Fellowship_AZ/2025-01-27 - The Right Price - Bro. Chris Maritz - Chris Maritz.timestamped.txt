[17:48] same age amen it's going to be a
[17:51] glorious time God bless you I greet you
[17:53] in the lovely name of Jesus Christ I
[17:56] wanted to take a moment and recognize
[17:58] this this is just impromptu and I
[18:00] thought I'd do this because a lot of
[18:02] times the church is not fully aware of
[18:04] who does what in our church and I would
[18:08] like all of our Junior and senior youth
[18:12] leaders their wives and their children
[18:16] if they can all come up here come up
[18:18] front right now James and Stephen and
[18:21] Justin Jenny uh Ethan and Hannah if you
[18:26] guys can all come up if you want to
[18:28] bring all your children
[18:31] and huh they're in Sunday school well go
[18:34] get
[18:43] them now I cannot
[18:45] overemphasize the
[18:50] importance of the youth
[18:53] leaders the time the effort that they
[18:56] put into
[18:58] speaking to our
[19:00] youth to organizing to having things set
[19:04] up to our camps and the time and now you
[19:08] guys your families are you've got some
[19:11] of you have got five children others
[19:13] have got a kid on the way and others you
[19:15] know and God has uh blessed you in many
[19:19] ways but the
[19:22] unselfishness that they have for our
[19:25] youth and the the time and the effort to
[19:29] go in to do it and to work with them uh
[19:32] because that is our
[19:35] Legacy and so I wanted to take a moment
[19:38] we have stepen mcney and Ashlin raise
[19:41] your hands so
[19:43] others they know uh he is uh come here
[19:48] from over there and
[19:50] overseas in uhel
[19:54] Ireland and uh he came over here and was
[19:59] at a couple meetings and youth and
[20:01] different things and next thing you know
[20:03] he comes over here and fell in love with
[20:06] one of our girls and we wouldn't allow
[20:08] him to take her back to Ireland so he
[20:10] had to move
[20:12] here and uh but uh he is also my
[20:17] associate Minister associate pastor here
[20:22] um and we're taking these young men and
[20:24] we're grooming letting them there's
[20:26] nothing any better than have our
[20:30] ministers to have Pulpit time that's the
[20:32] only way that you actually get better
[20:34] and so uh brother James and uh
[20:38] Allison raise your hand yes God bless

[50:54] him this morning amen and uh as we go to
[50:57] the word just now I just invite you to
[50:59] turn in your Bibles to the book of 1
[51:01] Corinthians 6 and
[51:03] 19 and uh we just trust that you'll be
[51:06] encouraged in the word today amen we
[51:08] bring you greetings from our your your
[51:10] extended family in the Pacific North
[51:12] West at Living Word Fellowship there and
[51:14] they said to make sure to extend a warm
[51:17] uh uh greeting to you so we say God
[51:19] bless you amen we're pressing the battle
[51:21] over there on the west coast you're
[51:22] pressing the battle over here amen who
[51:25] knows how many more services we'll have
[51:26] like this and what an honor it is to
[51:28] come together like this in this flesh in
[51:31] this time amen and even in our
[51:33] weaknesses and our our frailties we can
[51:35] come and praise our God we can bring
[51:38] glory to a living God today and uh and
[51:41] we have a reason to do that because we
[51:43] have a testimony we're a witness of the
[51:45] things he has done he is he is the god
[51:47] who when he said he he'll do something
[51:49] he will he does it amen and we're here
[51:52] to testify of that Resurrection we're
[51:54] here to testify of the power of God
[51:55] today so this morning we're going to add
[51:58] just another Stone we're going to add
[52:00] another Revelation I trust it'll be an
[52:02] encouragement to you we're going to
[52:03] speak this morning on this little
[52:05] thought of the right
[52:07] price and uh you know as we even say
[52:10] those words there are many things that
[52:12] come to our mind when we think of the
[52:13] right price you know uh maybe when you
[52:16] go purchase something there's always
[52:17] going to be a price attached to that
[52:19] object and it will be the right price
[52:21] now sometimes we don't like the price
[52:23] you know it's if it's something valuable
[52:25] if it's something that that is is worth
[52:27] something you know it's got some weight
[52:28] to it uh it's going to be expensive and
[52:31] uh we might not like that idea that it's
[52:33] expensive but it's the right price for
[52:36] that object because it has to match the
[52:38] the value the worth of that object so
[52:41] today we want to uh speak on what is
[52:43] this the the right price in 1
[52:46] Corinthians 6:19 it
[52:48] says what know ye not that your body is
[52:51] the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in
[52:53] you which you have of God and you are
[52:56] not your own and look at this next
[52:59] portion here in verse 20 for you are
[53:02] bought with a price amen therefore
[53:05] glorify God in your body and in your
[53:07] spirit which are Gods amen if you have a
[53:11] a need this morning you can let it be
[53:12] known with an uplifted hand we're just
[53:14] going to go to the Lord in prayer just
[53:15] at this
[53:16] time and Lord we just come father as we
[53:20] just feel so uh small in your wonderful
[53:23] presence today how we would just love to
[53:25] just sit here and just continue to
[53:26] Worship You Lord because Lord truly you
[53:29] have given us a song in our hearts thank
[53:31] you Lord you've given us a reason to
[53:33] worship you God because we see the value
[53:36] Lord of your word we see the value of
[53:38] your Holy Spirit we see the value in
[53:40] these things today oh God and we've come
[53:42] to give honor to those things Lord we've
[53:44] come Lord to give you praise Lord May
[53:47] Our Lives Lord be a sweet smelling Savor
[53:49] unto you and Lord I just come Lord in my
[53:52] in my in my Frailty Lord in my vessel
[53:55] today and I give you Lord the gift that
[53:57] you have placed in my life Lord may you
[53:59] use it as an instrument in your hands
[54:01] today as I just want to step aside Lord
[54:03] and you speak to your people father Lord
[54:06] you purchase them with your blood and
[54:08] may you come now and meet the needs of
[54:11] your people if as you saw the uplifted
[54:13] hands the desires that are on the hearts
[54:15] of your people father come and bless us
[54:17] in your presence today may we go from
[54:19] your house today saying Lord was it not
[54:22] good for us to be in the house of the
[54:24] Lord amen Lord we just give you praise
[54:26] now and give you thanks and come and
[54:28] open the word to us may we see things
[54:30] Lord we've never seen before may we draw
[54:33] something from you may we draw strength
[54:35] from you today Lord is our prayer in
[54:37] Jesus Christ's name we we we thank you
[54:40] amen you may have your seats for a
[54:43] moment well praise the Lord amen we can
[54:46] we can just almost close just on the
[54:48] scripture reading today you know as the
[54:50] Lord says that you are bought with a
[54:52] price so there's a price tag attached to
[54:55] you you know if you and maybe looked at
[54:57] the bottom of the sole of your foot
[54:58] there would be a price tag sitting there
[55:01] and there would be a certain value and
[55:02] only the architect the designer the
[55:05] creator of that body would know the
[55:07] exact value of that life of that vessel
[55:11] and so each and every one of you today
[55:12] you know uh God has created us uniquely
[55:15] specifically uh we're not here by
[55:17] accident we're not here by chance but
[55:19] you have a uniqueness to you there's
[55:21] something about you that is that that
[55:23] only you can bring you know there you're
[55:25] a an attribute of God's thoughts of his
[55:28] mind when he thought of the very end of
[55:30] the Gentile dispensation when he thought
[55:32] of the end of time and and here we're
[55:33] sitting here this morning it's not an
[55:35] accident we sit here God knows your name
[55:37] he knows your address he knows exactly
[55:39] who you are and you have a certain value
[55:42] to his kingdom because you only you can
[55:45] bring a certain uh Ting a certain sound
[55:48] that he's looking for at the end time
[55:50] amen so we see even as the darkness
[55:52] would creep in and we see all the things
[55:55] that are happening in the world and the
[55:56] chaos and the and the Darkness and and
[55:58] know the the as the enemy comes in like
[56:00] a flood we see all these things but yet
[56:02] at the same time God has somebody on the
[56:05] scene to meet those conditions amen he
[56:08] has a people that will worship a people
[56:10] that will live a life that is exactly
[56:13] according to what he had in his mind and
[56:16] so there is a price attached to you
[56:17] today there's a value amen and I love
[56:20] how we have a cross hanging here today
[56:22] amen it's just something that'll be
[56:24] coming up later on in the but remember
[56:27] there was a price uh about you am mean
[56:30] there's a value around your life so what
[56:32] is the right price we can talk about
[56:35] prices today but you know we'll haggle
[56:37] and deal and we'll try and get the best
[56:40] price you know we'll try and and to us
[56:41] the best price is the cheapest price you
[56:44] know we got some salespeople around here
[56:45] and and they understand that you know
[56:47] when you're negotiating they'll try and
[56:49] find flaws they'll try and find uh uh
[56:52] mistakes with the with a product or
[56:54] maybe a a little hiccup in the system
[56:56] system or something and and they're
[56:57] doing that to try and bring the price
[56:59] lower amen they they really want the
[57:01] object but but they want to bring the
[57:03] price as low as they can so that they
[57:05] can purchase it and make it their
[57:07] possession but at the end of the day
[57:08] there is truly the right price for an
[57:11] object amen now the price is dictated by
[57:15] the object so you know uh uh the price
[57:18] we place on food is not the the same
[57:20] value or the same price we might place
[57:22] on a house you know the the object
[57:25] dictates the value of that object amen
[57:29] it dictates the the price and the object
[57:31] will set the value thus the price of
[57:34] that object amen so even your life it is
[57:38] dictated a certain value to God the
[57:42] price will set the purchasing power amen
[57:45] so why do we have prices it is so that
[57:48] the consumer can come and he can take
[57:51] possession of an item but he has to come
[57:53] and he has to meet the same value that
[57:55] that object has set you following me so
[57:58] far amen all the sisters are are
[58:00] thinking about shopping and all these
[58:01] things and you know they're thinking of
[58:03] oh I had such a great deal you know but
[58:05] at the end of the day my brother and
[58:06] sister right those objects set the price
[58:09] and the reason why there's a price fixed
[58:11] is so that you can purchase it and not
[58:13] just purchase it and and put it in a
[58:15] shelf somewhere but you can make it
[58:17] yours amen you can you can take
[58:19] possession of it it it becomes in other
[58:21] words it becomes of value to you when
[58:23] you have taken possession of it
[58:26] so there has to be the right price put
[58:29] on things the full price must be paid
[58:33] for you to have full possession of it so
[58:36] the full price needs to be met you know
[58:38] we can have payments on a vehicle but
[58:40] until the vehicle is completely paid off
[58:42] until the full price has been paid until
[58:45] the right price has been met you cannot
[58:48] take possession completely you can
[58:50] pretend it's yours you know but at the
[58:51] end of the day the bank really owns it
[58:55] right who is owning your
[58:58] life you know if you think about that so
[59:01] the whole price has to be met for the
[59:04] object to be whole and complete the
[59:07] whole price has to be met and the price
[59:10] will reflect the object what is required
[59:14] is not more or less it is the right
[59:18] price the transaction will be complete
[59:21] and for it to be complete it needs to be
[59:23] exactly equal to the value of the object
[59:27] amen so a price gives a opportunity for
[59:32] someone to engage in a
[59:35] transaction now there's got to be a way
[59:37] to measure it for us to know the price
[59:39] of something we have to have a reference
[59:41] point there has to be a way that we can
[59:43] measure it there has to be a unit of
[59:45] measure either in weight or in quality
[59:48] uh or in number quantity there has to be
[59:51] a way that we can measure the object to
[59:54] understand its full value or it full
[59:56] potential or to understand the price of
[59:59] it we have to have measuring uh units
[1:00:02] units of measure you need to be able to
[1:00:03] measure it out as we uh have here and
[1:00:06] and the brothers thank you for helping
[1:00:07] me with the slides today you know what
[1:00:09] is the right price for a 3B bag of these
[1:00:12] oranges you know these oranges they um
[1:00:16] they they are3 lbs in in a bag like that
[1:00:19] and so there's a unit of measure and
[1:00:22] what is the right price for the weight
[1:00:23] of those oranges you know according to
[1:00:26] this website it's
[1:00:27] $4.98 that's on a special by the way now
[1:00:30] I'm not here to advertise so I'm not
[1:00:32] going to tell you which store this is in
[1:00:33] we might have some people leaving right
[1:00:35] away but this is the the right price for
[1:00:39] the weight of those oranges now those
[1:00:42] oranges were not always that weight
[1:00:44] right they they had to mature they were
[1:00:46] in seed form first but at the end of the
[1:00:49] day they they mature to this place where
[1:00:51] they come to the full weight or the full
[1:00:53] value of what they're intended for what
[1:00:56] their purpose is and at the right time
[1:00:58] in the right season the right place the
[1:01:00] pl the price will be right and then you
[1:01:03] can purchase that and it can be of use
[1:01:05] to you
[1:01:07] amen now everybody's thinking about
[1:01:10] lunch now brother Bram tells the story
[1:01:12] of of the the loaf of bread you know and
[1:01:16] he said how that you can have 25 cents
[1:01:18] in your pocket and he says that is as
[1:01:21] good as is if you have the loaf of bread
[1:01:24] that's like our faith so so the price
[1:01:26] the right price for that loaf of bread
[1:01:29] is05 cents now if you have the 25 cents
[1:01:32] you have the purchasing power for that
[1:01:34] loaf of bread in other words it's equal
[1:01:36] unto the possession of that bread amen
[1:01:39] 25 cents though it may look different
[1:01:42] it'll it'll it'll act differently it'll
[1:01:44] have different sounds if you drop it you
[1:01:46] know it'll have different weight but if
[1:01:48] you compare it to the loaf of bread the
[1:01:50] loaf of bread looks different from the
[1:01:52] outside amen but yet there's an equal
[1:01:56] point there they are valued the same
[1:02:00] right The Price is
[1:02:03] Right now let's look at the creation
[1:02:05] because remember everything is
[1:02:07] measurable everything has a weight
[1:02:10] everything has a design for a purpose
[1:02:13] for a reason so when God created the
[1:02:15] heavens and the Earth it was so that we
[1:02:17] can have units of measure it is so that
[1:02:19] we can understand a living God in
[1:02:22] Genesis 1:14 it says God said let there
[1:02:25] be lights in the firment of the heaven
[1:02:27] to divide the day from the night and let
[1:02:29] them be for signs and for seasons and
[1:02:33] for days and for years so so God you
[1:02:36] know he he's he's there and and he's in
[1:02:39] eternity and with all his thoughts and
[1:02:41] everything but there was no way to
[1:02:43] worship God Amen there was no way to
[1:02:46] know God until that invisible becomes
[1:02:49] visible and so he starts to create and
[1:02:52] and by the spoken word he starts to lay
[1:02:54] things out now remember he's not just
[1:02:56] halfhazard you know saying this should
[1:02:58] be green and and this over here should
[1:03:00] be like a tree and you know just you
[1:03:02] know halfhazard Le no there's a whole
[1:03:04] ecosystem out there everything is
[1:03:06] weighed out just right everything you
[1:03:08] know if you think of the the placing of
[1:03:10] the Moon and the Sun and the magnetic
[1:03:12] fields and everything has got to be
[1:03:14] exactly right exactly weighted and and
[1:03:17] measured out just to the te you know
[1:03:20] that the as he says he'll he's put
[1:03:22] lights in the firmament for what reason
[1:03:24] so we can measure a day
[1:03:27] isn't that amazing God creating lights
[1:03:29] in the heavens so that we as as mere
[1:03:32] mortals here on this Earth we can
[1:03:34] understand and we can start to see that
[1:03:36] there's time and there's something in
[1:03:38] motion there's a purpose to this earth
[1:03:41] amen why because there's a price there's
[1:03:43] a value on this Earth so God starts to
[1:03:46] set units of measure so that we can
[1:03:49] quantify the creation of God we can
[1:03:52] start to understand this this God and
[1:03:54] whom we have to do with
[1:03:56] right amen so for signs for seasons and
[1:03:59] and you can imagine as as the first you
[1:04:02] know second would tick away and then the
[1:04:05] next Second and then before you know it
[1:04:06] was 60 seconds and and now we have a
[1:04:08] minute you know all these new names and
[1:04:11] and New Revelations of of Time start to
[1:04:14] manifest itself and and then before you
[1:04:16] know it a day passes and and and you
[1:04:19] know what if you if you pay attention
[1:04:21] out there you'll notice the sun you know
[1:04:23] nobody nobody uh was worried about the
[1:04:25] Sun Rising today it's fixed there by the
[1:04:28] laws of God so that we can measure the
[1:04:30] time of day you know we know what time
[1:04:32] it is now we know at 10:00 we're going
[1:04:34] to start church today and we know all
[1:04:36] these things why because God has created
[1:04:38] units of measure so we can value these
[1:04:41] things amen so God has a purpose when he
[1:04:45] creates something time was set into
[1:04:47] motion God creating time to measure time
[1:04:50] and all these things so that we can
[1:04:52] value a day Genesis 1:16 goes on and
[1:04:56] says and God made two great lights now
[1:04:58] he's becoming more specific the greater
[1:05:00] light to Rule the Day and the Lesser
[1:05:02] light to rule the night he made the
[1:05:03] Stars also and God set them in the
[1:05:06] firmament of the heaven to give light
[1:05:08] upon the Earth there's the the very
[1:05:10] purpose of that light is to give light
[1:05:12] amen so God doesn't like I said he
[1:05:14] doesn't just uh you know it's not just
[1:05:16] for decoration he's got a plan he's got
[1:05:18] a purpose and as he has a plan and
[1:05:21] purpose he's the Creator those lights by
[1:05:23] the way do exactly what they're called
[1:05:25] to do right you know they don't you know
[1:05:27] decide well I'm tired of being a star
[1:05:30] I'm just going to go be the moon right
[1:05:32] we don't see chaos like that out there
[1:05:33] in God's creation no everything is
[1:05:36] weighted and it's for a purpose for a
[1:05:38] specific reason so it gives light in in
[1:05:41] upon the Earth and in verse 18 and to
[1:05:43] rule over the day and over the night and
[1:05:46] to divide the light from the darkness
[1:05:48] and God saw that it was good he's
[1:05:50] pleased with his Creation The Price is
[1:05:53] Right the value is being set
[1:05:57] it's being fixed in the evening and the
[1:06:00] morning were the fourth day we start
[1:06:02] measuring days how many days if you
[1:06:04] think about it have we come along and
[1:06:07] see the seen the creation of God fixed
[1:06:10] and and uh and and moving along by the
[1:06:13] law by the very nature of of God Amen so
[1:06:17] God set the the laws in motion setting
[1:06:19] the measurements in place in order that
[1:06:22] we may know and understand an eternal
[1:06:24] God how will we understand who he is
[1:06:28] unless he gives us something to measure
[1:06:30] it by now we notice quickly that
[1:06:32] everything is created with a specific
[1:06:34] function now think of your own life amen
[1:06:37] you were created you have a Creator amen
[1:06:40] we did not put ourselves here that
[1:06:42] somebody created us amen we we were we
[1:06:45] have a Divine architect behind our lives
[1:06:48] the the footsteps of the or of the
[1:06:50] righteous order of the Lord amen so we
[1:06:52] each have a a function just like the sun
[1:06:55] has a function the moon has a function
[1:06:57] everything has a a specific purpose in
[1:06:59] the great scheme the great plan of God
[1:07:02] and will have a specific value your life
[1:07:04] has a value on it now the moon and the
[1:07:06] sun were placed in a specific places up
[1:07:09] there in the heavens each object having
[1:07:11] a specific purpose each one playing
[1:07:13] their part amen what about your part
[1:07:16] this morning amen now Colossians 1:16
[1:07:18] says for by him were all things created
[1:07:21] that are in heaven amen that's
[1:07:23] everything right and are in Earth notice
[1:07:27] this here visible and invisible amen now
[1:07:31] you can trust that the things that you
[1:07:32] see in the visible you know if he is so
[1:07:35] detailed and he's so careful about the
[1:07:37] things in the in the visible realm how
[1:07:39] much more can we trust him for the
[1:07:40] things in the invisible realm now
[1:07:43] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[1:07:45] principalities or Powers all things
[1:07:47] somebody say all things all things all
[1:07:50] things amen we're created by Him now
[1:07:54] that's easy you know by him we can we
[1:07:56] can see that part but notice the next
[1:07:58] part here there's two parts here right
[1:08:00] by him and for him so let's just let's
[1:08:04] just cover this right now amen
[1:08:06] everything that he has created
[1:08:08] everything that he has created is for
[1:08:10] his purpose that's right so he set the
[1:08:14] value on everything he placed it he has
[1:08:18] a purpose he has a calling he has a
[1:08:20] design for
[1:08:23] everything praise the Lord and he is
[1:08:26] above all things and by him all things
[1:08:30] consist praise the Lord that should just
[1:08:33] bring a peace to our lives amen it
[1:08:36] should relax us thank you Lord You Are
[1:08:39] My Creator you have fixed everything my
[1:08:41] even my days are numbered the very hairs
[1:08:44] of my head are numbered praise the Lord
[1:08:46] amen so everything is measured
[1:08:48] everything has a season a Time amen now
[1:08:51] let's move forward a little bit
[1:08:52] everything is created by Him and for him
[1:08:55] him for his purpose everything yes even
[1:08:58] evil was made for him and I know this is
[1:09:01] where people get a little hiccup you
[1:09:02] know like really but God created
[1:09:05] everything I'd rather that evil be in
[1:09:07] his hands that it be in somebody else's
[1:09:08] hands amen because then it's measured
[1:09:11] and it has a value to it and it can only
[1:09:13] last so long and he has measured that
[1:09:16] out amen and that means that it will
[1:09:18] have a season a time and it will end
[1:09:20] amen so God is even in control of those
[1:09:24] things in Isaiah 45 just to be very
[1:09:26] clear about this in verse 5 he says I am
[1:09:28] the lord and there is none else there is
[1:09:31] no God beside me I GED thee though thou
[1:09:35] Hast not known me that thou that they
[1:09:37] may know from the rising of the Sun in
[1:09:40] the in other words when they witness
[1:09:42] these things the the motion of these
[1:09:44] things as the sun rises they will start
[1:09:47] to understand who God is so that they
[1:09:49] may know from the rising of the Sun and
[1:09:52] from the West that there is none beside
[1:09:54] me I I am the lord and there is none
[1:09:57] else amen now watch this next part he
[1:10:00] says I form the light and I create
[1:10:04] Darkness I make peace and create
[1:10:07] evil I the Lord do all these things so
[1:10:12] let's just like I said we want to just
[1:10:14] have a really strong Foundation this
[1:10:15] morning as we go forward into the
[1:10:17] service he has done all these things so
[1:10:21] everything in our lives is is
[1:10:23] orchestrated by God Amen even the
[1:10:25] hardships we go through the the good
[1:10:28] times the bad times God is in in all of
[1:10:30] those things he is behind every move he
[1:10:33] is omnipresent he is all knowing
[1:10:36] god god do not make a mistake in in
[1:10:39] birthing you in the family you were
[1:10:40] birthed in you did not make a mistake in
[1:10:43] in the things that happened in your life
[1:10:45] you might have lost a loved one you
[1:10:47] might have gone through a hard trial or
[1:10:48] or some hard knocks in life but God is
[1:10:51] in control of all those things amen amen
[1:10:55] amen because God is looking for the
[1:10:57] right price out of your life he is
[1:10:59] looking for the right thing the right
[1:11:01] expression to come from your life and he
[1:11:04] knows how to use all these things as
[1:11:06] instruments in his hands to bring you to
[1:11:08] the right place so at the right time
[1:11:11] you're the weight will be the right
[1:11:12] weight and the price will be the right
[1:11:14] price and there will be a Harmony
[1:11:16] between those things praise the
[1:11:19] Lord praise the Lord now all these
[1:11:21] things were created so that we can
[1:11:23] understand or measure the invisible
[1:11:26] things amen it's hard to understand an
[1:11:29] invisible God but you know he created
[1:11:31] all these things that we see around us
[1:11:33] today every everywhere we look the trees
[1:11:35] the the cactus the you know even this in
[1:11:38] this room here the people mothers and
[1:11:40] fathers and and children and and even
[1:11:42] this water sitting here everything is
[1:11:45] speaking is a expression of the
[1:11:47] invisible
[1:11:48] realm amen now like Moses was told to
[1:11:52] build the Tabernacle remember he had to
[1:11:54] go into to Heavenly places he went up on
[1:11:57] the mountain God took him away and he
[1:11:59] showed him the pattern that is in heaven
[1:12:01] and he said go and make this what you
[1:12:03] see here in heaven in other words in
[1:12:06] eternity and it's another dimension
[1:12:08] there's a replica there was a there's a
[1:12:11] an expression in the Unseen amen that
[1:12:15] that God took a prophet up into and he
[1:12:17] brought him up in the presence of the
[1:12:18] Lord and he showed him in the Unseen
[1:12:20] World he showed him the patterns and he
[1:12:22] showed him the measurements of the
[1:12:24] Tabernacle and he says what you see here
[1:12:26] go and build it on the earth so now he's
[1:12:29] There's Something Happening Here God is
[1:12:30] showing that that there's a reflection
[1:12:33] there's a whatever is happening on Earth
[1:12:35] is pointing back to the invisible realm
[1:12:38] and it has to be exactly the same you
[1:12:41] know you look at the details that God uh
[1:12:43] designed that Tabernacle with and the
[1:12:45] kind of skins and the kind of wood and
[1:12:48] the amount of gold that had to be used
[1:12:50] and the colors and the curtain and the
[1:12:52] placing of things why was he specific
[1:12:54] about the things because it has to be
[1:12:57] weighed exactly the same way it's
[1:12:59] weighed out in heaven the measurement
[1:13:01] has to be the same why because it's a
[1:13:04] reflection of the Unseen things and so
[1:13:07] when they see that Tabernacle you know a
[1:13:08] lot of people they would maybe pass by
[1:13:10] that Tabernacle in the wilderness and
[1:13:12] they would say man these Israelites are
[1:13:14] crazy you know look at this Tabernacle
[1:13:16] it's it's what is that all about what's
[1:13:18] the the smoke coming out of the the back
[1:13:20] room there for and what is the the the
[1:13:23] Brazen Altar and what are they doing
[1:13:24] over there but you know the people that
[1:13:26] were in the in the will of God and in
[1:13:28] the plan of God they saw something else
[1:13:31] Moses had Revelation he had
[1:13:33] understanding and and he was playing out
[1:13:35] a a mystery that would happen out in the
[1:13:37] future Church ages amen amen God
[1:13:40] tabernacling himself amongst men and
[1:13:43] here he has a a a a unit of measure he
[1:13:46] has something on the earth testifying of
[1:13:49] what is already taking place in Heavenly
[1:13:53] places there's this interesting
[1:13:56] comparison throughout the scriptures of
[1:13:58] the Unseen things to the seen things now
[1:14:02] just think for a moment here we are and
[1:14:04] we can see with these eyes around this
[1:14:07] room
[1:14:08] right amen we're all on the same Planet
[1:14:11] here anybody that's not like that stand
[1:14:13] up please identify yourself but we are
[1:14:16] we are here we can see and I wonder what
[1:14:19] do we
[1:14:20] see what do we see look around this room
[1:14:23] look at one another what do you see
[1:14:25] because everything in the visible was
[1:14:27] created to show us what is in the
[1:14:32] invisible so we start to see something
[1:14:34] we start to see a
[1:14:36] comparison a measurement between the
[1:14:39] invisible and the visible world what we
[1:14:42] see with our Naked Eyes is an expression
[1:14:46] of what we cannot
[1:14:48] see like God created a set of scales you
[1:14:51] know if you think about it like this God
[1:14:53] creating a set of scales so that we we
[1:14:55] can weigh out the Unseen to the seen we
[1:15:00] can measure out we can weigh out and
[1:15:03] what we see on this side of the scale
[1:15:04] have you ever seen those old scales
[1:15:06] right on this side of the scale you put
[1:15:08] some weights here and then on this side
[1:15:10] of the scale you you put an object and
[1:15:12] you try and balance the scales right you
[1:15:15] want to balance the scales why so that
[1:15:17] it's equal across now in the middle of
[1:15:19] the scale if we can just pretend today
[1:15:21] that that's a curtain of time in the
[1:15:23] middle of the scale we we cannot see
[1:15:25] past that curtain of time but beyond
[1:15:27] that curtain is a mystery and so on this
[1:15:30] side we we cannot see what's on that
[1:15:31] side but on this side we go through
[1:15:33] experiences and things happen and and
[1:15:36] things transpire and we go through these
[1:15:38] amazing incredible an adventure if we
[1:15:41] can say it like that with God and our
[1:15:43] walk with the Lord but at the and all
[1:15:45] this time there's something that is that
[1:15:47] is being weighed out on this side and
[1:15:48] the Lord knows what it needs to be uh
[1:15:51] according to the measurement of this
[1:15:53] side over here now there's a Hiser
[1:15:55] because we cannot see it amen but on
[1:15:58] this side God is refining he is is
[1:16:00] molding he fashioning so that it will be
[1:16:03] exactly equal with what's on the other
[1:16:05] side of the
[1:16:09] scale oh
[1:16:11] my we start to see something here a
[1:16:14] mystery of of how God is is working in
[1:16:17] our lives he's working in everything to
[1:16:19] bring a Harmony bring a balance to the
[1:16:23] scales to bring it to the right
[1:16:28] price we cannot see everything we cannot
[1:16:32] understand everything but we know that
[1:16:33] God is working everything together for
[1:16:36] our good amen everything has a value so
[1:16:39] in Psalms 19:1 it says the heavens
[1:16:41] declare the glory of God and we're going
[1:16:43] to move forward here a little bit the
[1:16:45] heavens declare the G glory of God in
[1:16:47] other words they they testify they are
[1:16:51] shouting from the hilltops if you can
[1:16:52] say it like that they are there are a
[1:16:54] witness of the value of God the glory of
[1:16:58] God now when we use this word Glory
[1:16:59] we're going to look at this a little bit
[1:17:00] today the the word Glory when we think
[1:17:03] of it we think of Pomp and majesty and
[1:17:06] all these things and all those things
[1:17:07] are correct but we're going to go a
[1:17:08] little deeper into this word the glory
[1:17:11] of God because it's not just a
[1:17:12] halfhazard like fireworks going off and
[1:17:15] then it's all over no the glory of God
[1:17:17] is something Eternal amen it is weighed
[1:17:20] out so the heavens declare they are
[1:17:23] fixed and they and they are literally
[1:17:25] telling us who God is they the heavens
[1:17:28] when we look at the sun we look at the
[1:17:29] moon and the stars and the sky they are
[1:17:32] declaring who God is we can measure God
[1:17:35] by the things we see in the heavens and
[1:17:36] that's why the heavens are so vast we
[1:17:39] don't even have the the technology great
[1:17:41] enough to reach the edge of the universe
[1:17:44] we cannot see far enough we we're
[1:17:46] designing Rockets to try and get us to
[1:17:48] the moon and all these things you know
[1:17:50] the the technology that we are trying to
[1:17:52] create on Earth why because we want to
[1:17:54] measure the value the the price tag of
[1:17:57] the heavens but the heavens declare the
[1:17:59] glory of God Amen they declare his value
[1:18:03] so everything is speaking of him and the
[1:18:06] firmament showeth his handywork so the
[1:18:09] heavens Express they are the visible of
[1:18:12] the
[1:18:14] invisible and hanging there by the word
[1:18:17] of God put there placed there by the
[1:18:20] word of God what a statement if you
[1:18:22] think of the heavens declaring the glory
[1:18:24] of God God the heaven showing making
[1:18:27] known explaining or revealing the
[1:18:29] mystery of who God is if you ever have a
[1:18:31] question about the godhead just look up
[1:18:33] in the sky how many suns are
[1:18:36] there how many great lights are there
[1:18:39] about it amen there's no question about
[1:18:41] it God has written his Bible the the the
[1:18:45] the whole expression of the of the
[1:18:46] universe signify who God is the heavens
[1:18:49] tell the story of the Unseen God in
[1:18:51] other words the heavens portray or
[1:18:54] manifest the mystery of God that's why
[1:18:56] the Bible is a reflection of what we see
[1:18:59] in the heavens so the heavens have a
[1:19:02] purpose amen what do we see then in the
[1:19:04] heavens in 1 Corinthians 15 and 40 now
[1:19:07] in the New Testament the the they go
[1:19:10] into greater detail Paul picks these
[1:19:12] things up and he's and he's now going to
[1:19:13] go into greater detail about what do we
[1:19:15] see in the heavens and and there's a
[1:19:18] lengthy scripture here but I'm just
[1:19:19] going to highlight a few scriptures you
[1:19:21] can go read this chapter in your own
[1:19:22] time he says there are also celes Ral
[1:19:25] bodies and bodies terrestrial in other
[1:19:27] words there are objects in the heaven
[1:19:29] and there are objects on Earth there are
[1:19:31] objects that are Earthbound there are
[1:19:32] objects that are heavenbound and then he
[1:19:34] says but the glory of the celestial is
[1:19:37] one here's that word Glory again so he's
[1:19:39] saying that the celestial the heavenly
[1:19:41] bodies or objects have a glory right and
[1:19:46] the glory of the terrestrial is another
[1:19:48] now it's distinctly saying that the the
[1:19:50] glory of the Earthly one is different it
[1:19:53] looks different amen like the trees
[1:19:56] don't look like the stars they look
[1:19:59] different their glory is
[1:20:01] different in verse 41 it says there is
[1:20:04] one glory of the Sun and another glory
[1:20:06] of the Moon amen the Moon is not the
[1:20:09] same even though it gives light it is
[1:20:11] not its own light that it gives like the
[1:20:13] sun the sun gives its own light it's the
[1:20:16] source of light amen it's the bringer of
[1:20:19] life it's the what warms the Earth amen
[1:20:22] like the presence of God warms this room
[1:20:23] here amen it's it's the that's the
[1:20:26] lifegiver the moon does not have that
[1:20:28] ability has its own function in other
[1:20:31] words it has its own glory and so it
[1:20:33] doesn't do that it reflects the greater
[1:20:36] light and brings light in the evening
[1:20:38] time but all these things are a story of
[1:20:41] what is in the
[1:20:43] invisible specific bodies like the sun
[1:20:46] moon telling us about the the Sun how
[1:20:49] God is is is is the great husband and
[1:20:52] and the and the Moon is the bride and
[1:20:54] you know you know we know all these
[1:20:55] types and shadows but so the point here
[1:20:58] today is that the the the each body has
[1:21:01] a specific Glory each body has a
[1:21:03] specific function in other words it has
[1:21:06] a value and that value is the right
[1:21:09] price for what is in the invisible amen
[1:21:13] they express the glory of God while
[1:21:16] having their own Glory the sun is a type
[1:21:18] of God the bright shining light the Moon
[1:21:20] is a type of the bride of Christ now
[1:21:21] remember as they express the glory of
[1:21:24] God they to have their own
[1:21:26] Glory so there's a glory of God that's
[1:21:29] being expressed which is the mystery
[1:21:31] from The Unseen but at the same time
[1:21:33] they have their own Glory even in this
[1:21:36] temporal world you know your body has a
[1:21:38] has a certain function has a certain
[1:21:40] Glory you know God would never be known
[1:21:42] as a Healer unless he used your body to
[1:21:46] show that he is a Healer so your body
[1:21:48] even in this temporal condition has a
[1:21:51] glory to it the glory of these bodies
[1:21:55] amen you know we're so excited about the
[1:21:56] new bodies coming but don't miss the
[1:21:59] value of what you have right here today
[1:22:01] God using your life using your body to
[1:22:04] do what to signify or Express the Unseen
[1:22:07] God Amen how has God made Mis visible in
[1:22:10] our midst here today he's using your
[1:22:12] body so your body has a glory like the
[1:22:16] Moon it reflects the bright and Shining
[1:22:18] Light am Hallelujah it has a value it
[1:22:22] has a price on it yes amen and only you
[1:22:27] can bring that kind of value can bring
[1:22:29] that Glory declare the glory of
[1:22:32] God so the sun plays its part and comes
[1:22:35] into full
[1:22:36] view amen as as the day progresses the
[1:22:41] seconds tick away all those measurements
[1:22:43] God put in place so that we can
[1:22:46] understand a living God we see a visible
[1:22:49] expression of a living God
[1:22:55] at the very moment where the sun comes
[1:22:57] to its full brightness you know it is
[1:22:59] perfectly equal to the invisible
[1:23:02] God it is like God isn't that amazing
[1:23:07] there's a moment where everything in
[1:23:08] creation comes to its full manifestation
[1:23:12] that's right and it's equal with God
[1:23:14] because it's a full expression there's a
[1:23:16] moment where everything is in Harmony
[1:23:19] and the expression is the invisible God
[1:23:22] being made flesh
[1:23:26] in the message things that are to be
[1:23:27] brother brandham says now they only
[1:23:29] express that there's a greater of the
[1:23:31] same kind all these temporal things
[1:23:33] trees our bodies you know he he talks
[1:23:35] about the trees struggling for life he
[1:23:37] says it only signifies that there's a
[1:23:39] greater one on the other side amen that
[1:23:42] the one that doesn't die amen the tree
[1:23:44] of life and so he says because these are
[1:23:46] the same kind the likeness all these
[1:23:48] things that he did expresses the things
[1:23:51] that are to come Ju Just as the body
[1:23:54] gives you here just as this body he gave
[1:23:56] you to live in only expresses that there
[1:23:59] is one that is greater amen Yet to Come
[1:24:03] praise the Lord for that amen amen so
[1:24:06] these bodies here Express something you
[1:24:08] know the the Bible talks it's such
[1:24:10] beautiful scriptures how he talks about
[1:24:13] this body has has borne the image of the
[1:24:15] Earthly you know this body is literally
[1:24:18] the expression it is the the the the
[1:24:20] manifestation of the Earthly image and
[1:24:23] it expresses what
[1:24:25] right it's showing that there is coming
[1:24:26] another image as we are expressing the
[1:24:29] image of as we are born here on Earth we
[1:24:32] express the Earthly image we will also
[1:24:34] Express the Heavenly image amen thank
[1:24:37] you
[1:24:38] Lord 1 Corinthians 1549 says and we have
[1:24:42] come to we have borne the image of the
[1:24:44] Earthly we shall also bear the image of
[1:24:47] the Heavenly there's a here's this once
[1:24:49] again on on both sides of the scale we
[1:24:51] have this invisible uh uh expression
[1:24:54] image amen now it's it's something
[1:24:56] that's already there I've gone to
[1:24:58] prepare a place for youen if this
[1:25:00] Earthly T Tabernacle be dissolved I have
[1:25:03] one already amen it's there it's it's
[1:25:06] waiting so we have this comparison so on
[1:25:08] this side while we go through our
[1:25:10] experiences and everything everything is
[1:25:12] pointing to this heavenly one here is
[1:25:15] that amazing you know we don't just walk
[1:25:18] around this world halfhazard everything
[1:25:20] is expressing the Unseen realm you're an
[1:25:23] ambassador for the kingdom of
[1:25:26] [Music]
[1:25:27] heaven so let's take a quick look at
[1:25:29] this word Glory Isaiah 40 and3
[1:25:32] says the voice of him that crith in the
[1:25:35] wilderness we love these scriptures amen
[1:25:37] God is is preparing the way for for him
[1:25:39] to come on the scene he's going to have
[1:25:41] a prophet again on the scene to do what
[1:25:43] to point to him right where the
[1:25:45] expression is going to be amen cuz why
[1:25:48] there has been a price there's been a
[1:25:50] measurement there's been a value that
[1:25:52] has been established before the found
[1:25:54] found of the world the lamb was slain
[1:25:56] before the foundation of the world so
[1:25:58] it's already been measured out and now
[1:26:01] Through the Ages and Through Time what
[1:26:03] happens prophets come on the scene and
[1:26:05] they start to prophesy of one who is
[1:26:07] coming amen what are they doing they're
[1:26:09] pointing to the weight of measurement
[1:26:11] that is on the in the Unseen realm but
[1:26:14] there has to be the other side of the
[1:26:16] scale there has to be in the in the
[1:26:18] living side in the in the side where
[1:26:20] time is ticking away there has to be a
[1:26:22] fulfillment of those things to meet or
[1:26:24] to come into harmony with what was in
[1:26:26] the mind of God so he has a Prophet come
[1:26:29] on the scene to do what to point out the
[1:26:31] measurement to point out where he is
[1:26:33] where that expression is taking place
[1:26:36] amen so that we can recognize Heaven and
[1:26:38] Earth is is here there's a Harmony the
[1:26:40] right price is about to be paid and
[1:26:42] there will be a Harmony there will be a
[1:26:44] possession amen there will be a like an
[1:26:46] inheritance that God brings to the
[1:26:49] earth a fulfillment of his promise he
[1:26:52] says go prepare ye the way way of the
[1:26:54] Lord Mak straight in the desert a
[1:26:56] highway for our God every Valley shall
[1:26:58] be exalted and every mountain and Hill
[1:27:01] shall be made low and the and the
[1:27:03] Crooked shall be made straight and the
[1:27:05] rough places plain and I love the
[1:27:09] scripture and the glory of the Lord
[1:27:12] shall be
[1:27:14] revealed the glory here's that word
[1:27:16] Glory again the glory of the Lord shall
[1:27:19] be
[1:27:20] revealed Amen in The Invisible we've got
[1:27:22] it on the scales there right now
[1:27:25] remember time is in the middle so we
[1:27:26] can't see past the curtain of time but
[1:27:28] on on the other side in the Unseen
[1:27:30] there's this prophecy about a lamb right
[1:27:33] amen there's the lamb that had been
[1:27:35] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:27:37] we already know you know in the Unseen
[1:27:39] God already knows who that's going to be
[1:27:42] he has a name amen and he has a certain
[1:27:44] time that he's going to come you know
[1:27:46] that is the God has created that land
[1:27:48] for a
[1:27:49] purpose that's right a virgin birth all
[1:27:54] these things you know even in Genesis
[1:27:56] there's a prophecy of the crushing the
[1:27:58] the the Serpent's head right but in this
[1:28:02] side remember now we've got glory on
[1:28:03] this side because it's saying that the
[1:28:06] glory of the Lord shall be revealed so
[1:28:09] in other words the value of God the
[1:28:12] expression the fullness of his value the
[1:28:15] fullness of his measurement will come
[1:28:18] right and you will see it and you will
[1:28:20] know him because he'll be measurable
[1:28:24] amen oh you think of God stepping down
[1:28:28] and cond descending down to earth and
[1:28:32] and making himself known and fitting
[1:28:33] into every scripture fitting into every
[1:28:36] measurement and every T is crossed and
[1:28:39] ey is dotted and you think of how God Is
[1:28:42] So in control to bring all those
[1:28:45] scriptures you know 300 plus scriptures
[1:28:47] I think it's even 600 scriptures that
[1:28:49] came to manifestation came to full
[1:28:51] measurement came to its fullness in the
[1:28:53] time of Jesus Christ amen him coming
[1:28:56] down and taking up all those things to
[1:28:58] do what to to balance the
[1:29:03] scales so there's a glory in the Unseen
[1:29:06] remember it has its own look even though
[1:29:08] we cannot see it amen it has a glory it
[1:29:11] has a function it has a value and
[1:29:13] expression but on this side there's a
[1:29:15] glory in the visible realm and the glory
[1:29:19] of this realm the glory of that realm
[1:29:21] have to match has to be the right exact
[1:29:25] right price amen praise the Lord so the
[1:29:30] glory of the Lord shall be revealed and
[1:29:32] All Flesh shall see it together for the
[1:29:34] mouth of the Lord has spoken it in John
[1:29:37] 1:14 now we're going to jump forward
[1:29:38] where this is manifested amen we we know
[1:29:41] John 1:1 really well but I want to skip
[1:29:43] forward to John 114 it says and the Word
[1:29:46] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[1:29:50] beheld in other words now this is the
[1:29:52] Fulfillment of that we beheld we see we
[1:29:55] can quantify we can we can see the value
[1:29:59] amen we can see the glory or the full
[1:30:01] weight of that
[1:30:03] prophecy now when they looked you know
[1:30:05] maybe they were surprised I thought he
[1:30:08] was going to come you know in the clouds
[1:30:09] and and bring a whole Legion of angels
[1:30:11] with him and he was going to defeat the
[1:30:13] Romans and and free us from our bondage
[1:30:15] and oppression and all these things but
[1:30:18] remember he comes in the exact value
[1:30:21] that is in the Unseen amen he cannot
[1:30:24] deviate from that he does nothing unless
[1:30:26] the father shows him first in other
[1:30:28] words what's playing out in the Unseen
[1:30:30] the vision of the word that is playing
[1:30:32] out the the the characters the drama the
[1:30:35] script that is playing out in the Unseen
[1:30:37] it has to come into harmony with with
[1:30:39] the flesh realm with this seen realm and
[1:30:42] here he is and God showing has power
[1:30:44] over all these things that here's a Son
[1:30:46] of God that can walk in harmony with the
[1:30:49] mind of
[1:30:50] Christ the firstborn of many Brethren a
[1:30:53] new race that is in harmony that can
[1:30:56] that can come and and and signify the
[1:30:58] very glory of God those things that are
[1:31:01] Mysteries those things that are unseen
[1:31:03] they can pick those things up and they
[1:31:05] can literally let it be expressed
[1:31:07] through their
[1:31:08] flesh the mystery of God in
[1:31:12] flesh so what did this Glory look like
[1:31:15] it was Jesus
[1:31:17] Christ you know they criticized him they
[1:31:20] mocked him they made fun of him they
[1:31:23] they you know they pushed pushed them
[1:31:24] aside it doesn't
[1:31:26] matter he had to come
[1:31:29] exactly exactly according to the word he
[1:31:32] had to it's amazing how God can hone all
[1:31:35] those things in and he walks exactly in
[1:31:38] the vision that is in the Unseen
[1:31:43] amen and thus we beheld his glory you
[1:31:47] start to see what this word Glory means
[1:31:49] we beheld his value we see the
[1:31:52] expression what was in the Mind Of God
[1:31:54] what was in the Unseen now we can see it
[1:31:57] we beheld the glory that's right Glory
[1:32:00] as of the only begotten of the father
[1:32:02] full of grace and truth we actually see
[1:32:06] him now it doesn't matter that everybody
[1:32:09] understands it does not matter that
[1:32:10] everybody accept the way God does things
[1:32:12] but God is held by those rules amen that
[1:32:15] he whatever he expresses in the visible
[1:32:18] is to show what is in the invisible
[1:32:21] realm that's how God works that's his PR
[1:32:24] Exodus 19:10 says and it came to pass
[1:32:26] and Aaron spake unto the whole
[1:32:28] Congregation of the children of Israel
[1:32:30] that they looked toward the Wilderness
[1:32:32] and behold the glory of the Lord
[1:32:34] appeared in the cloud we can spend a lot
[1:32:36] of time just just on this one subject
[1:32:39] here because remember the cloud is also
[1:32:41] a form amen it is a what is a cloud it's
[1:32:44] the veil of Heaven that's what the
[1:32:46] clouds do I know you guys don't get a
[1:32:48] lot of clouds here so let me explain in
[1:32:50] in British
[1:32:52] Columbia brother Jim not amused Amen in
[1:32:55] British
[1:32:56] Columbia we get these clouds and you
[1:32:59] literally cannot see the sun you cannot
[1:33:01] see the heavens why it's a veil for
[1:33:04] heaven right right so it has a glory it
[1:33:07] has a it has a value it expresses
[1:33:10] something that is in the invisible right
[1:33:12] but when you see it we know that those
[1:33:14] things have come in harmony the
[1:33:16] invisible has has married has merged
[1:33:20] with the
[1:33:21] visible oh my
[1:33:24] we'll leave that for another day the
[1:33:26] glory of the cloud what a sermon behold
[1:33:29] the glory of the cloud the of the Lord
[1:33:31] appeared in the cloud amen a cloud
[1:33:35] expressing the glory or the weight or
[1:33:37] the expression of God now this word
[1:33:40] Glory when we look it up in the in the
[1:33:42] Strong's Dictionary the word Glory here
[1:33:45] it is it is properly as they say
[1:33:47] properly in English it is to mean wait
[1:33:51] we i g HT wait
[1:33:54] something that is made heavy so the word
[1:33:58] Glory when we think of the glory of the
[1:34:00] Lord we think of of the glory that we
[1:34:02] beheld of him and and all these things
[1:34:04] and and the glory of the celestial the
[1:34:06] glory of the terrestrial and the glory
[1:34:08] of these bodies we think of a weight
[1:34:12] that is on a
[1:34:14] scale
[1:34:16] balanced and weighed out in another
[1:34:19] place in the strong it says it is to be
[1:34:22] heavy to make
[1:34:24] weighty you know you can have a weight
[1:34:26] on this side of the scale but if you
[1:34:28] want it to be balanced on this side you
[1:34:30] got to make it the right weight to be
[1:34:32] made
[1:34:33] weighty you know the scripture comes to
[1:34:36] my mind that we are we are changed from
[1:34:39] Glory unto Glory you see it's not just
[1:34:43] like a pump and a big demonstrations and
[1:34:46] it's not just that amen we praise God
[1:34:48] for the the demonstrations of God and
[1:34:50] the signs that follow them that believe
[1:34:52] and I'm not against those things amen we
[1:34:54] praise God for those things but remember
[1:34:57] that the being changed from Glory unto
[1:34:59] glory is is the weight you know that we
[1:35:01] have in our lives the the value that we
[1:35:03] have in our life God is constantly
[1:35:05] fashioning that weight and adding one
[1:35:08] brick to another line upon line precept
[1:35:10] upon precept and we're being fashioned
[1:35:13] by the Divine architect why do we go
[1:35:15] through those fiery furnaces and the
[1:35:17] trials of Our Lives why my brothers and
[1:35:19] sisters to make that weight measure come
[1:35:21] into harmony come into balance with
[1:35:23] what's in the Unseen because there's an
[1:35:26] image of you on the in the Unseen your
[1:35:28] name is written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:35:30] Life there's the real you on the inside
[1:35:33] and God is fashioning that God is
[1:35:35] working it out amen and and and making
[1:35:37] it so that it weighs what is in his
[1:35:41] book balancing the
[1:35:43] scales the right price praise the
[1:35:48] Lord Revelations 21:24 says and the
[1:35:51] nation of them which are saved shall
[1:35:53] walk in the light light of it and the
[1:35:54] kings of the earth do bring their Glory
[1:35:57] and Honor into it they bring their
[1:35:59] tribute or they bring their measured
[1:36:02] wealth
[1:36:04] amen 2 Corinthians 4:17 says for our
[1:36:07] light Affliction which is but for a
[1:36:09] moment worketh for us a far more
[1:36:12] exceeding and eternal weight of
[1:36:17] Glory you start to see this picture
[1:36:20] now like on balances amen when weighing
[1:36:23] it out and the temporary things that we
[1:36:26] Face here cannot even be put on the
[1:36:28] scale it cannot even be compared to what
[1:36:31] God is working in your life because
[1:36:33] there's another scale God is fashioning
[1:36:36] you he making you amen thank you Lord
[1:36:39] praise the Lord everything remember evil
[1:36:42] and good using it to Fashion you and
[1:36:45] make you way just
[1:36:48] right Exodus 28:2 says and thou shalt
[1:36:51] make holy garments for Aon and thy
[1:36:53] brethren for Glory and for beauty so
[1:36:57] even in the garments of Aaron they were
[1:36:59] made for what for Glory now if you look
[1:37:02] at his garments you know maybe we we
[1:37:03] would say Well they're not really flashy
[1:37:05] or anything like that so that word Glory
[1:37:07] again it does not necessarily mean that
[1:37:09] what it means is it is weighted exactly
[1:37:13] to how we have a Heavenly priest amen so
[1:37:16] the the garments of Aaron as the high
[1:37:18] priest over the temple and those things
[1:37:19] and His function as a priest he was an
[1:37:22] example on Earth of what was happening
[1:37:24] in the heavenlies that we have a high
[1:37:26] priest of our confession that the our
[1:37:28] names are written on his in his heart
[1:37:31] right here where the the the breastplate
[1:37:32] is of that the urum Thum and all those
[1:37:35] things the supernatural light that high
[1:37:37] priest signified the weight that is in
[1:37:39] the Unseen
[1:37:43] realm balancing out the Unseen and the
[1:37:47] seen Jesus Christ then came to pay the
[1:37:50] price of redemption remember it had to
[1:37:52] be the right price and brother brandham
[1:37:55] spends a lot of time talking about the
[1:37:57] kinsman redeemer and and how he has to
[1:37:59] be in the right position to be able to
[1:38:01] pay the right price for Redemption he
[1:38:03] had to be in the right position amen he
[1:38:05] had to be a Kinsman right he had to be
[1:38:07] made flesh dwell Among Us amen for the
[1:38:10] right price to be paid he had to be
[1:38:13] willing amen amen he had to be willing
[1:38:15] in other words nobody else could do this
[1:38:18] but him there's no man found in heaven
[1:38:20] or earth that could do this amen he was
[1:38:23] the only one the right price required
[1:38:25] that one person at the right time in the
[1:38:27] right season would meet the requirement
[1:38:30] of God Amen and it and it literally says
[1:38:33] that he drank the full
[1:38:35] wrath the full wrath and he said on the
[1:38:37] cross it is finished you know it's
[1:38:39] amazing that cross even looks like
[1:38:41] scales balancing Out Heaven and Earth to
[1:38:44] bridge a gap for us amen so we can come
[1:38:46] in harmony with God where we're not
[1:38:48] enemies with God anymore but we can be
[1:38:50] called his
[1:38:51] friend prise amen but look at how he he
[1:38:55] came to Earth and he had to go through
[1:38:56] sufferings and trials he had to be
[1:38:58] rejected he had to go through all those
[1:39:00] things why because the right price had
[1:39:03] to be met couldn't be just whatever
[1:39:05] price you know God could have brought an
[1:39:07] army down he could have wiped off all
[1:39:09] these things he could have just you know
[1:39:11] set us free he could have done whatever
[1:39:12] he wanted to but the right price had to
[1:39:15] be
[1:39:18] paid the full price had to be met
[1:39:23] and so the process begins it required
[1:39:26] the blood of a spotless lamb he had to
[1:39:29] be Kinsman he had to be born of a virgin
[1:39:32] each and every penny if we could say it
[1:39:34] like that being added to that scale
[1:39:37] because it's weighing out against the
[1:39:39] Unseen the very mystery that's in God's
[1:39:42] mind the plan of God his grace his love
[1:39:45] his Redemption Story the whole thing
[1:39:47] that's in his mind he is letting it play
[1:39:50] out on this side adding precept upon
[1:39:52] precept Penny upon Penny wait upon wait
[1:39:55] until finally Jesus Christ comes into
[1:39:58] the fullness of what he was called to
[1:40:01] be so that he could be the right price
[1:40:04] he could pay the right price for our
[1:40:06] Redemption
[1:40:08] amen each and every penny had to be met
[1:40:11] even though he had great signs and
[1:40:13] wonders you know if you think of this
[1:40:14] Jesus Christ in his ministry he had
[1:40:16] Great Signs there was many wonders in
[1:40:18] his ministry and great things that
[1:40:20] happened people were healed delivered uh
[1:40:22] even raised from the dead dead amen but
[1:40:24] even at that even through all that we
[1:40:26] could say well that's amazing praise God
[1:40:28] for his presence we see the glory of God
[1:40:30] that was not the full glory of God do
[1:40:34] you see what I'm saying the full value
[1:40:36] of him was not just in the signs and in
[1:40:39] the Wonders and the healings and the
[1:40:41] demonstrations it was not just in those
[1:40:43] things that's part of it but he has to
[1:40:45] meet the full measurement he has to come
[1:40:48] to the full glory and God uses things in
[1:40:52] in his environment in his in his
[1:40:54] proximity to bring him to that full
[1:40:56] value now we love the signs I mean we
[1:40:59] those things are easy we love worshiping
[1:41:02] we love the good things of God the
[1:41:03] blessings of God but my brother and
[1:41:05] sister it does not bring us to the full
[1:41:07] Glory of our life we need everything he
[1:41:10] created everything for this purpose amen
[1:41:13] the good and bad in our lives to bring
[1:41:16] us to the full measurement the full
[1:41:19] expression there came a time when Jesus
[1:41:22] Christ had to be betrayed
[1:41:24] and it's amazing that when he was
[1:41:25] betrayed we see these words in John
[1:41:27] 13-31 he says therefore when he was gone
[1:41:30] speaking of Judas Jesus said now is the
[1:41:33] son of man
[1:41:34] glorified and God is glorified in him in
[1:41:37] other words you know the healings were
[1:41:39] amazing all these things were great but
[1:41:41] now when when he comes to the very
[1:41:43] purpose of his calling the very purpose
[1:41:46] of his expression the very purpose of
[1:41:48] why he came to the earth now he's coming
[1:41:50] to the fullness of it and it doesn't
[1:41:51] matter my brother and sister all these
[1:41:53] things you know the seasons change times
[1:41:55] change all these things change why
[1:41:57] because it has to come to its full
[1:41:59] measurement God had to go to a
[1:42:03] cross and to do that he had to have
[1:42:06] someone betray him amen he had to have
[1:42:09] the Roman government there to bring
[1:42:10] oppression bring people in from around
[1:42:12] the world and and and and so that Mary
[1:42:15] would come to to the right place at the
[1:42:17] right time everything had to be
[1:42:18] orchestrated for uh by God for him amen
[1:42:23] why because the price had to be met the
[1:42:25] balances would have to the scales would
[1:42:27] have to be balanced and so we find God
[1:42:29] coming on the scene he he has the Romans
[1:42:31] there he has everything playing out
[1:42:33] exactly to his plan there are tools and
[1:42:35] instruments in his hand to do what to
[1:42:37] bring the right weight of Glory from his
[1:42:40] life and yes it was hard it was not easy
[1:42:43] how he was rejected he was falsely
[1:42:45] accused he was brought through the Hall
[1:42:46] of critics he had to go through all
[1:42:48] those things why my brother and sisters
[1:42:50] because that would be the full measure
[1:42:51] of his glory that even in the hard times
[1:42:54] there was a strength there was a power
[1:42:56] that that would bring about the purpose
[1:42:59] of God in his life if we can say it like
[1:43:01] that nothing could defeat the purpose of
[1:43:03] God I mean it' be easy to have a to have
[1:43:06] a victory it would be easy to have glory
[1:43:09] and all these things in the good times
[1:43:10] but my brother and sister it's not the
[1:43:12] full picture amen he is showing to us
[1:43:16] that even in the dark times even in the
[1:43:18] hardships in those things he brings
[1:43:20] glory to himself nothing can defeat the
[1:43:23] purpose of God and there we find him
[1:43:25] being betrayed amen people that were in
[1:43:27] his midst people that were around him
[1:43:29] betraying him and what does he do he has
[1:43:31] to go to the Cross yeah why because the
[1:43:34] scales have to balance amen that's what
[1:43:38] he was created
[1:43:39] for in the very Mind Of God he was the
[1:43:42] slain lamb before the foundation of the
[1:43:44] world he had to come to this full
[1:43:46] picture oh if he you know he knew what
[1:43:49] he was there for my brother and sister
[1:43:51] and and if you think of him coming to
[1:43:53] The Garden of Gethsemane even you think
[1:43:55] of the character of Christ there in the
[1:43:57] garden even there he he knows this is
[1:43:59] the requirement he knows what's laying
[1:44:01] ahead and even in that body in that
[1:44:03] frail human body like we have here today
[1:44:06] he recognizes this is a hard thing and
[1:44:10] the blood separates from from his sweat
[1:44:13] like this and and you know it it goes
[1:44:15] into a a a state of of of pain and hurt
[1:44:18] and anguish but he had to go through
[1:44:20] those motions why because there was an
[1:44:23] image in The Invisible realm that that
[1:44:26] only he could play out nobody else could
[1:44:28] do what he did nobody else could could
[1:44:30] pay the price for our Redemption he is
[1:44:33] the only one that could meet the right
[1:44:35] price to meet the requirement of God to
[1:44:38] come to the fullness of the glory of God
[1:44:40] in his
[1:44:42] life praise the Lord oh Don't Fear The
[1:44:44] hardships Don't Fear the hard times God
[1:44:47] is using it as a tool as a fashion tool
[1:44:50] to to bring you to the full Glory that
[1:44:52] he has written of you you and nobody
[1:44:54] else can write that can play out that
[1:44:56] part nobody else can be that character
[1:44:58] in the
[1:45:00] story thank you Lord now can the son of
[1:45:03] man be
[1:45:05] glorified now can the full weight be
[1:45:08] measured
[1:45:09] Quantified and when he hung on that
[1:45:11] cross he said it's
[1:45:13] finished scales went click yeah and the
[1:45:17] onlooker said the requirements been
[1:45:20] met amen Jesus Christ said I come in the
[1:45:23] fullness in the volume of the book that
[1:45:25] is written of me he was walking in the
[1:45:27] vision of the prophecies he was walking
[1:45:30] in the vision the words of the prophets
[1:45:32] he was walking in the volume of the book
[1:45:34] that was written of him he he knew what
[1:45:36] the Unseen World had a picture of him
[1:45:39] of and he could walk in that Vision you
[1:45:42] know God has let us look beyond the
[1:45:43] curtain of time he let us look at the
[1:45:46] other side of the scales and he see and
[1:45:47] we see ourselves walking in the vision
[1:45:50] of the word going into a Rapture that's
[1:45:52] already been written it's already been
[1:45:54] played out so we come the same way we
[1:45:56] say we come in the volume of the vision
[1:45:59] amen we come in the volume of the book
[1:46:01] why because on that side of the scale
[1:46:03] it's been weighed out in this life no
[1:46:05] matter what I have to go through no
[1:46:07] matter the hardships no matter the
[1:46:08] mountaintops The Valleys no matter the
[1:46:11] things that come by my way God is more
[1:46:13] than able to make me weigh the right
[1:46:15] kind of value so that I can be in
[1:46:17] harmony with the vision
[1:46:23] amen oh it's exciting almost huh because
[1:46:26] I want to hear those scales
[1:46:28] click huh and at that moment when they
[1:46:31] clicked what happened my brother and
[1:46:32] sister the veil was rent into two and
[1:46:34] the temple and the Earth shook amen the
[1:46:37] whole place is going through a
[1:46:38] convulsion amen why because something
[1:46:41] was happening Heaven and Earth was was
[1:46:43] coming together the the the weights have
[1:46:47] been met the the the requirement had
[1:46:49] been met the price have been paid the
[1:46:50] right price amen and everything was in
[1:46:53] harmony with the will of
[1:46:55] God oh you think he can stop the plan of
[1:46:58] God in your life you think he can stop
[1:47:00] the purpose of God playing out in your
[1:47:02] life you know the devil tried it with
[1:47:03] Daniel he tried it with the Hebrew
[1:47:05] children he did all those things that he
[1:47:06] could do to them we look at all the
[1:47:08] martys throughout the ages my brother
[1:47:09] and sister nothing can stop the purpose
[1:47:12] of God from being weighed out in your
[1:47:15] life and it will meet every little ounce
[1:47:18] and you might say why do I go through
[1:47:19] this financial trouble why do I have
[1:47:21] this trouble in my family God is
[1:47:23] weighing out the ounces you know we're
[1:47:25] at we're at a time where he's just you
[1:47:27] know sanding a little bit here and he
[1:47:29] puts it on the scale and he says oh it's
[1:47:31] so beautiful so close just going to
[1:47:33] scuff a little bit here and just a
[1:47:34] little bit of sanding here we're going
[1:47:36] to get into the finer sandpapers now why
[1:47:38] because we're getting to those very last
[1:47:40] few
[1:47:41] Strokes one of these days the scales
[1:47:43] will balance and we'll take another step
[1:47:46] and we will not belong here anymore
[1:47:49] because we'll be one the bridge would
[1:47:51] have been Gap the Gap would have been
[1:47:52] bridged amen praise the
[1:47:55] Lord Brother Braham says when he seen
[1:47:57] that creation had fallen in the message
[1:48:00] identification I'm not sure if I have
[1:48:01] that on the slides sorry brother now his
[1:48:04] own loving character molded himself into
[1:48:07] that very person of Christ he says God's
[1:48:09] own character of Love projected himself
[1:48:12] in the man Christ as Paul speaking here
[1:48:15] thinking of not robbery making himself
[1:48:17] equal to God making himself equal he
[1:48:21] fashioned himself he he he he walked in
[1:48:24] the way that would make him equal with
[1:48:26] God you know Enoch walked that way he
[1:48:29] walked with God and was
[1:48:33] not see his own character molded that
[1:48:35] kind of a person
[1:48:39] character
[1:48:41] character the character of
[1:48:43] Christ amen there was a value on this
[1:48:47] side of the scale and it was called the
[1:48:50] character of God the character of Christ
[1:48:53] and then in this character if we had to
[1:48:54] examine his character we would find a
[1:48:57] loving God a god of Grace a god of Mercy
[1:49:00] the Lamb of God a merciful god this is
[1:49:03] the character of God one who was able to
[1:49:06] meet the requirement of the Judgment of
[1:49:09] God Amen this is the character now on
[1:49:12] this side what is what does the bible
[1:49:15] teach us that he learned obedience amen
[1:49:19] amen why because there's a character on
[1:49:21] this side so on this side he he made
[1:49:23] himself he allowed himself to be molded
[1:49:25] into this
[1:49:27] character he was it was the right price
[1:49:30] for this character he had to be molded
[1:49:33] subjected to things Amen to do what to
[1:49:36] learn obedience to in other words to
[1:49:38] come into harmony with the weight of the
[1:49:41] of the
[1:49:43] scale in other words he counted the cost
[1:49:46] he knew what was
[1:49:48] required how is he measured we look at
[1:49:51] at another quote here in the message
[1:49:52] here him he says God's searching for
[1:49:54] real man I don't know how big his
[1:49:57] muscles are men are never judged by his
[1:50:00] muscles men are judged by character amen
[1:50:05] I've seen men that weigh 200 lb and
[1:50:07] solid muscle and don't have an ounce of
[1:50:09] man in
[1:50:11] him but man is measured by character
[1:50:15] there was never a man like Jesus Christ
[1:50:18] and the Bible said there was no Beauty
[1:50:20] we would desire him but a character
[1:50:24] so when we're talking about the glory of
[1:50:26] God we beheld his glory it wasn't that
[1:50:28] he was this amazing you know uh uh uh
[1:50:31] Angelic being and you know all the
[1:50:33] wasn't like that he was a humble human
[1:50:35] being God wrapped in in a veil like that
[1:50:38] Tabernacle in the wilderness wrapped in
[1:50:40] obscurity and and and and veiled from
[1:50:44] from the the wise and and The Prudent
[1:50:46] amen he was there in a mystery form but
[1:50:48] there he was and it was nothing that men
[1:50:50] would desire him he was not beautiful in
[1:50:52] that way way but what was the glory of
[1:50:55] him it was the character of Christ being
[1:50:58] manifested in his life
[1:51:00] amen there had never been a man like
[1:51:02] Jesus Christ the Bible said there's no
[1:51:04] Beauty we should desire him but a
[1:51:06] character like it has never been
[1:51:09] molded that's right hear ye him
[1:51:12] Revelations 3:18 says now as we just
[1:51:15] take another little turn here
[1:51:18] today Revelations
[1:51:20] 3:18 we know the scripture well this is
[1:51:22] our scripture right Angel unto the
[1:51:31] leans what does he say here what does he
[1:51:34] admonish the church that is in the lean
[1:51:38] Church age what does he admonish them to
[1:51:39] do he says I counsel thee to buy of me
[1:51:42] gold tried in the fire here we have this
[1:51:45] weight again a value gold is one of the
[1:51:49] most precious medals we have it is
[1:51:51] something of great value
[1:51:54] that thou mayest be rich now remember
[1:51:56] this this idea of being rich here is not
[1:51:58] rich in wealth in worldly wealth but
[1:52:01] there's there's something we can be
[1:52:03] wealthy
[1:52:04] in amen even right now we can be wealthy
[1:52:08] in this gold amen buy of me gold and if
[1:52:11] you look at the wording here to buy of
[1:52:14] me gold that means that there's a
[1:52:15] transaction taking
[1:52:17] place amen if I'm reading this correctly
[1:52:21] everybody reading the same scripture as
[1:52:22] me
[1:52:23] right to buy which means that there's a
[1:52:25] transaction taking place which means
[1:52:27] that there will be an object there will
[1:52:29] be something to purchase and there will
[1:52:31] be a purchaser or a consumer that will
[1:52:34] have the right uh Goods that will have
[1:52:36] the right um pennies right will have the
[1:52:39] right uh resources to do what to
[1:52:41] purchase what's on that side he'll be
[1:52:44] able to purchase this so this gold that
[1:52:46] he's saying come buy of me gold it's an
[1:52:48] invitation come and buy of me gold
[1:52:51] that's been tried in the fire amen
[1:52:53] that's tried in the fire so what is this
[1:52:55] now this is just briefly here we're not
[1:52:57] going to spend a lot of time on this but
[1:52:58] this goal that he's talking about is the
[1:53:00] character of Christ amen it's character
[1:53:04] it is and that is that is something of
[1:53:06] value it's got a price to it it's got
[1:53:08] the right price to it amen and and now
[1:53:11] if he's saying come buy of me gold that
[1:53:13] means that in his mind in the Unseen
[1:53:16] right in the mystery form he's got
[1:53:18] something on the
[1:53:20] scales this is for each and every one of
[1:53:22] you
[1:53:23] for each and every one of you there's a
[1:53:24] scale sitting in front of you on the
[1:53:25] other side of the scale in the Unseen
[1:53:28] there's a character there's a gold that
[1:53:32] has been weighed out for you for your
[1:53:34] life amen and it's called the character
[1:53:37] the Christlike character and he's saying
[1:53:40] to you today come and buy of me in other
[1:53:42] words you can have a transaction you can
[1:53:44] make a purchase today and purchase you
[1:53:47] can TR have a transaction where you can
[1:53:49] take this for the right price amen for
[1:53:52] the right price you can receive this
[1:53:55] amen and take possession of this and
[1:53:58] make it yours am amen now brother Brown
[1:54:01] says this in the message saman Church
[1:54:05] age is from this um Church age book he
[1:54:07] says James 1 2 to 4 he says my brethren
[1:54:09] count it all joy when ye fall into
[1:54:11] diverse Temptations praise the Lord amen
[1:54:14] everybody's excited about those
[1:54:16] things but remember now we're looking at
[1:54:18] this differently because that's Glory
[1:54:20] that's waiting there for us that's
[1:54:23] weight that's gold nuggets that's you
[1:54:25] know we need to start looking at things
[1:54:27] differently amen there's ounces of gold
[1:54:29] there waiting for you am man if we put
[1:54:30] some ounces of gold out here in the
[1:54:32] front and I said hey this is freely
[1:54:34] available you if you decide that you
[1:54:35] want some of this you can have it
[1:54:37] everybody would just stay in their seats
[1:54:39] right no no way it's free it's it's
[1:54:42] available come and make a transaction
[1:54:45] amen come and and and take a hold of it
[1:54:48] make it yours amen so so look at this
[1:54:50] here he's saying this these temptation
[1:54:52] are those nuggets of gold it's it's the
[1:54:55] it's the it's got value to it knowing
[1:54:57] this that the trying of your faith
[1:54:59] worketh patience but let patience have
[1:55:01] her perfect work that you may be perfect
[1:55:04] and entire wanting nothing in other
[1:55:06] words that you can reach the full weight
[1:55:09] of Glory concerning your
[1:55:12] life the full weight of
[1:55:15] Glory this is the transaction remember
[1:55:18] we can't buy character like we do at the
[1:55:20] grocery store right you tell me if you
[1:55:23] if you see some I would love to to know
[1:55:25] about it amen but you can't you can't
[1:55:27] buy love you can't buy those attributes
[1:55:29] of God at a grocery store so how do we
[1:55:32] purchase these things there's the hint
[1:55:35] there Temptations trials the things that
[1:55:37] try our
[1:55:39] faith is working something to perfect us
[1:55:42] to bring us to the full weight that has
[1:55:44] been measured of
[1:55:47] you
[1:55:48] H Prophet says why does he stand by you
[1:55:52] know through our trials and through the
[1:55:54] sufferings it feels like he's just
[1:55:56] standing off to the side he doesn't hear
[1:55:58] us or doesn't know about it Lord do you
[1:56:00] see what I'm going through why does he
[1:56:03] stand by the reason is in Romans 8:1
[1:56:05] 1718 and if children then heirs Heirs of
[1:56:07] God joint HS with Christ and if so be
[1:56:10] that we suffer with him that we may be
[1:56:13] also
[1:56:14] glorified together for I reckon that the
[1:56:17] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:56:19] worthy to be compared to the glory which
[1:56:21] shall be
[1:56:22] revealed in us so there's a glory
[1:56:26] there's a weight there's a value amen
[1:56:28] like I said there's a price tag on you
[1:56:32] that God knows about he put it there and
[1:56:35] there's a glory there's a weight from
[1:56:37] The Unseen that is going to be made
[1:56:39] visible in your life yes now how do we
[1:56:42] get there how do we get to this point
[1:56:44] where we can come to the place where we
[1:56:46] know God we have a relationship with God
[1:56:48] and we can walk in the fullness of the
[1:56:50] things he's called us to
[1:56:53] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:56:54] reign with him you have to suffer to
[1:56:56] Reign the reason for this is that
[1:56:59] character simply is never made without
[1:57:01] suffering character is a
[1:57:05] victory it's not a gift so God knows
[1:57:09] that we're going to purchase this gold
[1:57:11] that's tried in the fire it's not a gift
[1:57:14] this is something we fight for this is
[1:57:15] something we wrestle it out with like
[1:57:18] Jacob he could never be who he was
[1:57:21] unless he came and and remember remember
[1:57:23] the scripture says that that you cannot
[1:57:25] see the glory of God and live that's
[1:57:27] what the scripture said you cannot see
[1:57:29] him face to face you cannot see him for
[1:57:31] who he is you cannot see the full
[1:57:33] measure of God you cannot stand in his
[1:57:35] reflection and live and so people
[1:57:38] thought that you know if you saw God you
[1:57:40] would die but you know Jacob he could
[1:57:43] never fully come to the full weight of
[1:57:45] Glory of his life unless he came face to
[1:57:48] face with God in other words he cannot
[1:57:50] see God he cannot see the glory of God
[1:57:53] see the manifestation of God and ever
[1:57:56] live the same way again because your
[1:57:58] life is being changed it's being changed
[1:58:01] from one weight to another Jacob as he
[1:58:04] was wrestling it out with the angel amen
[1:58:06] wrestling it out with God a human being
[1:58:08] wrestling it out with a Heavenly
[1:58:10] creature can you imagine what's taking
[1:58:12] place the the scales are are being
[1:58:14] balanced amen wrestling it out with God
[1:58:17] lord what have you called me to Lord I
[1:58:19] need your strength Lord I need to what
[1:58:21] what what is your purpose concerning me
[1:58:23] is wrestling it out with God maybe one
[1:58:26] of you here today want to wrestle it out
[1:58:28] with God lord I want to see the other
[1:58:30] side of the scale what have you called
[1:58:32] me to what's my purpose in this walk I
[1:58:35] feel different I feel funny or maybe
[1:58:37] don't fit in whatever it may be remember
[1:58:39] there's a price upon your life there's a
[1:58:42] value and only you can bring that yes
[1:58:45] very
[1:58:46] good he wrestles it out and what happens
[1:58:49] he his name is changed the Lord touches
[1:58:52] his walk he walks
[1:58:54] differently becomes a prince with
[1:58:59] God he what was happening a transaction
[1:59:02] was taking place you know he was a Shyer
[1:59:05] before he was just a little deceiver
[1:59:07] running away from his problems afraid of
[1:59:10] his brother and all these things and you
[1:59:12] know the the the mess and the chaos of
[1:59:14] his life this was the character of of
[1:59:17] Jacob but it was not what God had
[1:59:19] written about him there was a story
[1:59:21] about about how how Jacob would become
[1:59:24] Israel and how he would walk with God
[1:59:26] like a prince like a ruler with God Amen
[1:59:30] and even though it did not look like
[1:59:31] that at this time in his life he looked
[1:59:33] like a failure looked like a weakness
[1:59:35] God knew exactly how to Fashion that
[1:59:37] gold because he says come and buy of me
[1:59:39] gold in other words come and have a
[1:59:41] transaction come make a purchase and how
[1:59:43] did he make that purchase through a life
[1:59:46] experience through the experiences of
[1:59:49] Jacob's life he was being fashioned he
[1:59:51] was purchased sing unto himself
[1:59:53] Revelation weights of
[1:59:56] gold adding unto his stature in that
[2:00:00] way praise the Lord until the time where
[2:00:02] the the scales would be balanced
[2:00:05] completely you think you think Jacob
[2:00:07] would ever regret going through those
[2:00:09] experiences God called them to no sir
[2:00:13] because the revelation of who he is in
[2:00:16] Christ that he's a part of something
[2:00:19] he's a part of the Eternal plan of God
[2:00:21] he's part of the Redemption plan he's
[2:00:24] part of God am huh you cannot Escape God
[2:00:28] he he he's not going to you know be a a
[2:00:31] half God or a partial God he's going to
[2:00:33] have every weight accounted for every
[2:00:35] joint every member will be
[2:00:43] there character is a victory amen so
[2:00:47] when you go through trials and things
[2:00:49] and you go through mind battles and
[2:00:51] games and things you know the devil
[2:00:53] knows how to play games right that's
[2:00:55] right but the Lord's using him to do
[2:00:57] what he knows the value that's in your
[2:01:00] life might be why am I going through
[2:01:02] this trial again why am I suffering like
[2:01:04] this why because he sees the
[2:01:08] value and you know we should just stand
[2:01:10] back and say Lord this is happening I I
[2:01:13] recognize something's happening here
[2:01:15] something's taking place let me not get
[2:01:17] caught up carnally let me not react
[2:01:20] carnally but Lord let me let me look
[2:01:22] past the curtain of time let me walk
[2:01:25] with you Lord through this Valley let me
[2:01:27] see what it is that's sitting on the
[2:01:29] other side of the
[2:01:30] scale you know you mothers that that
[2:01:33] that maybe have lost the children or
[2:01:35] maybe your children are in the world you
[2:01:36] know the prophet talks about how we go
[2:01:38] into the resurrection and we come and
[2:01:40] sit at that table on Mother's Day He
[2:01:42] says that'll be the greatest Mother's
[2:01:44] Day on that day all the scales will be
[2:01:46] balanced amen and he'll show to you why
[2:01:49] you went through the things you went
[2:01:50] through on this side of the world of
[2:01:52] this side of the of time of the curtain
[2:01:54] of time he says he will put his fingers
[2:01:56] into your mind and and unwrap all those
[2:01:58] knots all those questions you have for
[2:02:00] why this had to happen why this took
[2:02:02] place and why this trial here and he
[2:02:04] will show you the plan of God on that
[2:02:06] day the scales will be balanced on that
[2:02:09] day the full weight of Glory of of your
[2:02:12] life will be shown on that day why and I
[2:02:15] have to go through this why do I have to
[2:02:17] face cancer why do I have to face these
[2:02:19] things in my life because God has a
[2:02:21] weight of
[2:02:22] Glory he sees you on the other side of
[2:02:24] the scale and he says you are more than
[2:02:26] able through through me my grace is
[2:02:28] sufficient for you just keep walking
[2:02:31] keep walking with me can put your hand
[2:02:33] in mine you can trust me cuz I'm working
[2:02:36] I'm fashioning something in your life
[2:02:37] that only you can bring nobody else can
[2:02:40] bring that sound that Ting that I'm
[2:02:42] looking for only you you have a
[2:02:46] price and he knows how to bring the
[2:02:49] value of that
[2:02:50] price in your life life thank you
[2:02:57] Jesus oh there's so many things but let
[2:03:00] me just let me close with the story of
[2:03:01] Jonathan is that all right Jonathan the
[2:03:05] prince what an incredible character you
[2:03:09] know I I think often of of Jonathan you
[2:03:12] know he's not one of the the characters
[2:03:14] that you hear preached about a lot you
[2:03:16] know nobody preaches about Jonathan
[2:03:19] right Saul's son you know he he comes to
[2:03:23] such a interesting end you know it it
[2:03:26] looks so bad it looks so like ah like a
[2:03:31] tragedy you know but to me the the
[2:03:34] character of
[2:03:37] Jonathan it really speaks to me you know
[2:03:40] there is Jonathan he's the next in line
[2:03:43] to be king right let's face the facts
[2:03:46] here he's the next in line to be king he
[2:03:49] he works with his father and his father
[2:03:52] King Saul he goes through his own
[2:03:53] struggles we're not going to talk about
[2:03:55] Saul today right but you know he went
[2:03:57] through his own struggles and yet he
[2:03:58] played out the purpose of God okay but
[2:04:01] look at how God used Saul in in
[2:04:04] Jonathan's life Jonathan you know he had
[2:04:07] to come to the right place at the right
[2:04:09] time for something to be said about his
[2:04:12] life and David you know with the with
[2:04:14] the Eyes Like an Eagle he looks at that
[2:04:16] scene there when they when they died on
[2:04:18] that hill and what does David
[2:04:20] declare right right in the end they were
[2:04:23] not divided there's this it's an
[2:04:25] interesting phrase in the end they were
[2:04:27] not divided they were like eagles like
[2:04:29] Swift Eagles this is the testimony that
[2:04:32] David gives this is when he looks at the
[2:04:34] life when when Jonathan finally comes to
[2:04:37] the fullness of the expression of his
[2:04:40] life oh I hope you hear what I'm saying
[2:04:42] today sir when he stood on that Hill
[2:04:45] next to his father yeah no one else
[2:04:48] could pay the price Jonathan paid amen
[2:04:51] but someone had to meet the requirement
[2:04:54] someone had to stand there in the gap
[2:04:55] for his son MTH he had to stand there as
[2:04:59] a father in his position and even though
[2:05:02] I'm sure people came to him and said
[2:05:04] your father has failed your father has
[2:05:06] done this your father is not walking
[2:05:08] with the Lord he's not doing what he
[2:05:09] should be doing and this battle is going
[2:05:11] against him you should run you should
[2:05:13] leave you should do this you should do
[2:05:15] that that would be carnal but Jonathan
[2:05:17] knew his
[2:05:18] position he knew this is my place it's
[2:05:20] next to my father father right here and
[2:05:22] it doesn't matter what his father was
[2:05:24] doing his life his testimony is not
[2:05:27] dictated to by his father's walk he has
[2:05:31] his own scale to balance he his own
[2:05:34] weight of Glory to bring out and and his
[2:05:37] his responsibility is how he reacts to
[2:05:40] the situation his responsibility is for
[2:05:43] the character of Christ to shine to
[2:05:46] stand next to his father on that hill to
[2:05:48] pay the ultimate price the right price
[2:05:53] amen amen amen what a character am what
[2:05:59] a character on
[2:06:01] display and David stands there who is
[2:06:03] his friend can you imagine Jonathan his
[2:06:06] friend is is going to be king God has
[2:06:09] has told David David you're going to be
[2:06:12] the next king you know I'm moving Sol
[2:06:14] aside and you're going to lead My People
[2:06:16] Like a Shepherd and all these beautiful
[2:06:19] things and then no doubt David and
[2:06:21] Jonathan would talk about these
[2:06:23] things think of the the the Mind battles
[2:06:27] that Jonathan must have gone through the
[2:06:29] next in line to be king that was his
[2:06:32] right that was his inheritance was the
[2:06:34] kingdom he would be the next king he
[2:06:36] would have all these Provisions he would
[2:06:38] have all these things he could look
[2:06:40] after his son but look at how he came
[2:06:42] into harmony with the will of
[2:06:44] God and it was a hard thing to do it was
[2:06:48] not easy he could not defend himself he
[2:06:50] could not make claim for himself he
[2:06:52] could only walk in the path God has
[2:06:54] called him to walk but the key was
[2:06:57] staying honorable maintaining his
[2:06:59] Integrity in his walk with the Lord amen
[2:07:03] amen why because there's a glory on that
[2:07:06] side of the scale there was a there was
[2:07:07] a statement concerning Jonathan that was
[2:07:10] weighed out was measured out in the end
[2:07:13] they were not divided he stood next to
[2:07:16] his father he died with him on that hill
[2:07:19] and in dying on that Hill what did he do
[2:07:22] he purchased a seat for his son at the
[2:07:24] king's
[2:07:26] tableall Hallelujah because his son
[2:07:28] would not be able to walk his son would
[2:07:31] not have the strength the resources he
[2:07:33] would be in the wrong bloodline he would
[2:07:35] be the wrong everything but his the
[2:07:37] price he paid was the right price
[2:07:40] because on the other side of the scale
[2:07:41] there was a seat that had to be paid for
[2:07:44] at the king's table and Jonathan was
[2:07:46] willing he was the only one that could
[2:07:48] do it he was the only one nobody
[2:07:52] daddies I want to encourage you don't
[2:07:54] don't wait for somebody else to do
[2:07:55] what's right for your family only you
[2:07:57] can pay the price only you can do what's
[2:07:59] right amen and don't be afraid of doing
[2:08:02] what is right don't be afraid of
[2:08:05] standing in the Gap and I think of
[2:08:06] Arnold Von vinkle Reed right he stood
[2:08:08] there was it for Finland nobody else
[2:08:11] could do that that was his part because
[2:08:13] on in the Unseen realm there was a
[2:08:15] champion for
[2:08:16] Finland that would give his life the
[2:08:19] right price had to be paid for the
[2:08:20] freedom of Finland amen Jonathan Stan
[2:08:25] there no doubt many questions in his
[2:08:27] mind but he knew one thing Lord this is
[2:08:29] what you've called me to and I'll stand
[2:08:32] here in honor in Integrity I will stand
[2:08:35] here with my father Lord I will pay the
[2:08:38] price you know in this day we live in we
[2:08:41] think of our rights our our freedoms
[2:08:44] we're going to do whatever we want we
[2:08:46] can do go wherever we want we should we
[2:08:49] should really just become quiet before
[2:08:51] God and say Lord all this carnality
[2:08:53] around me all these voices all these
[2:08:55] things going on but Lord what is your
[2:08:57] opinion Lord what is the weight that is
[2:09:00] sitting on the outside scale let me
[2:09:02] glance through the curtain of time oh
[2:09:05] God and let me see the the victory that
[2:09:07] is waiting for me yes oh don't be afraid
[2:09:10] of the of the trial don't be afraid of
[2:09:12] standing on that Hill alone sometimes we
[2:09:15] stand there and we got to we got to face
[2:09:17] things and my brother and sister it's in
[2:09:20] those moments you are per purchasing oh

[2:09:25] fire amen and guess what that's the only
[2:09:28] thing you're taking with
[2:09:29] you so I want to encourage you today as
[2:09:33] we stand
[2:09:35] together I want to encourage
[2:09:38] you don't look at the carnal things amen
[2:09:42] don't look at things
[2:09:45] carnally there's a weight just beyond
[2:09:48] the curtain of time there's a a value
[2:09:51] there there's a glory concerning your
[2:09:53] life amen regarding you each and every

[2:11:16] of us have a story each and every one of
[2:11:18] us have a trial that's catered that is
[2:11:21] designed is fitted just to you and in

[2:11:56] walk through the valleys that can walk
[2:11:58] through the storms and maintain an
[2:12:00] Integrity like
[2:12:02] Jonathan oh what a you know he should be
[2:12:06] heralded as one of the great champions
[2:12:08] of the Bible for a a victory of
[2:12:11] character if there's ever a man in the
[2:12:13] Bible in my humble
[2:12:15] opinion that should get a badge should
[2:12:18] be awarded the the victory of character
[2:12:20] badge it should be
[2:12:22] Jonathan and I'm sure his son when his
[2:12:25] son sits at that table yes
[2:12:28] yes I could not bring myself to this
[2:12:31] table but somebody paid the right price

[2:12:36] that I can sit here
[2:12:38] today oh glory to
[2:12:41] God praise the Lord you know somebody
[2:12:46] else whose name starts with a J paid the
[2:12:49] right price for you also so you could
[2:12:52] sit at his table and even though we are
[2:12:54] weak and maybe we could not bring oursel
[2:12:56] to the table paid the right price thank
[2:12:59] you Lord of redemption to bring you to
[2:13:01] the seat that belongs to

[2:13:13] there is the grace of God bought with a
[2:13:17] price thank you Jesus bought in the shed
[2:13:20] blood of the Lamb
[2:13:22] can you imagine what God thinks of
