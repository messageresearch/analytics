[28:48] our life
[28:50] becomes change because we believe in
[28:53] that which you are
[28:55] we thank you for this opportunity we ask
[28:58] the Lord that you would bless us
[29:00] do things for us here this evening Lord
[29:03] that we would desire it
[29:06] I ask it of you in the name of the Lord
[29:08] Jesus
[29:09] amen and amen amen God bless you you may
[29:13] be seated
[29:16] you want to say once again it's a
[29:18] pleasure to be here with you
[29:21] kind of a
[29:22] full-time preacher
[29:24] but I believe God cares for you and a
[29:28] lot of things I get sensitive on is that
[29:31] I don't know that a lot of things
[29:33] matters to us a whole lot about what
[29:36] does matter
[29:38] but you know there's something to matter
[29:40] in our life I want to see Christ
[29:45] I want to know him in the power of his
[29:47] resurrection
[29:51] I want to heal is sick I want to raise
[29:53] the Dead I want to see God alive in the
[29:57] lives of our people
[29:59] is that true
[30:01] amen and I think that we talk about
[30:04] these things and I believe that's why
[30:07] God set him in our hearts today to
[30:10] believe these things that God careth for
[30:12] us because when you begin to care God
[30:16] begins to care you don't care if things
[30:19] pass up that way but this evening we
[30:23] just ask the Lord to bless the word of
[30:25] God and and the things that are said if
[30:29] you need someone can I ask you a
[30:30] question how many of you have never been
[30:32] baptized anybody in here never been
[30:35] baptized one hand
[30:37] two three four I would suggest you got
[30:42] that taken care of as soon as you can
[30:47] now I'm serious
[30:48] I'm serious
[30:50] if Jesus is coming we best take it
[30:53] advantage and start getting ready amen
[30:57] and how many don't feel well tonight and
[30:59] you need a healing power there's one two
[31:03] well there's a few people like that and
[31:06] I raise my hand among those things also
[31:08] we serve a risen savior we send the
[31:12] world today and the thing of it is we're
[31:14] not here to entertain we're not here to
[31:16] do certain things but we're here to
[31:18] bring about in our life the power of the
[31:21] resurrected Jesus Christ Among Us he
[31:24] lives amen and if you believe it you
[31:27] know it's hard no doubt to get a church
[31:28] to be moved by such things we just sit
[31:32] there but I I want to address these
[31:36] things today because uh he lives
[31:41] I live
[31:42] amen he is my kinsman redeemer
[31:46] amen and that's the things that we want
[31:49] in our our lives and we're looking for a
[31:52] passage of scriptures if the player
[31:55] would play that song Or for our chapter
[31:58] today I'd appreciate it
[32:02] I believe it's in Hebrews if you would
[32:05] please
[32:14] I'm sorry I guess I missed my quota to
[32:17] them to ask them to put that that on he
[32:20] cares for you and what I wanted to play
[32:23] out of that I wanted Hebrews 7 verses 1
[32:27] through 3 for this Melchizedek can you
[32:30] do that for me
[32:38] all right if you have your Bibles in
[32:40] turn with me if you would to Hebrews
[32:42] chapter 7.
[32:51] Hebrews chapter 7 and we would like to
[32:54] begin reading on the uh book that we
[32:58] have for us
[33:00] goodness
[33:06] I think it's the third verse 7-3
[33:10] without father without mother without
[33:12] descent having neither beginning of day
[33:16] or end of life but made like unto the
[33:20] Son of God abideth the priests forever
[33:22] continually
[33:25] as we look at these scriptures you may
[33:27] be seated Master God would bless them
[33:30] sorry we miss the
[33:33] but what touches my heart this morning
[33:35] or this afternoon as we look at the word
[33:37] of God
[33:39] when God has laid out for you or I to
[33:42] accept he cares for you
[33:45] and examples are put up to help us to
[33:48] become considerate of the things that
[33:50] God has done for us
[33:52] we believe it because he declared it and
[33:55] that's exactly what we're talking about
[33:58] and I I think about as the scriptures
[34:00] start and what I'm preaching out is who
[34:04] is this Melchizedek
[34:07] how many of you would like to know him
[34:09] better
[34:10] how many would like to know why his
[34:12] purpose was there
[34:15] and then we have another one is that
[34:18] he's laid out for us to look at also as
[34:21] a seed shall not be Heir with a shook
[34:25] if you're counting on being part of a
[34:27] shuck you might as well get it made up
[34:31] but all for Christ and God before us
[34:34] that it said here the seed shall not be
[34:37] here with the Shook and I say to myself
[34:40] dear God you've got to do something for
[34:43] me to make me just that way because we
[34:47] get to a condition that a lot of things
[34:49] don't mean much to us anymore how many
[34:52] of you want to make the rapture
[34:55] how many of you want to see the grace of
[34:57] God I I do we and it takes that in our
[35:01] life and as we look at the things that
[35:03] God has for us we want to do that and I
[35:07] thought one of the last little sermons I
[35:11] chose and set out to preach upon was the
[35:14] Tolkien
[35:16] that if there ever was a need that was
[35:19] needed in the spiritual life of a
[35:21] Christian
[35:22] they are the token that God has laid
[35:25] forth for our lives
[35:28] and I have to say that when the
[35:30] statement is made about the token I also
[35:34] believe that the air will not be air
[35:37] with the or deceived will not be aired
[35:39] with the shuck I believe that comes
[35:42] under obedience and I believe that God
[35:44] cares for you
[35:46] and as we think on these things and my
[35:50] desire is to make us
[35:53] in my little bit of preaching I do to
[35:56] make you more hungry to see Christ than
[35:58] you've ever saw him before
[36:00] that he will deliver you and do great
[36:03] things for you if you will ask
[36:06] and I think about these men and you say
[36:09] well it's just the token
[36:12] but you see there was a lot of things
[36:14] went into the making of the token
[36:18] and I'd like to talk to a few little
[36:20] things that we have for him as they are
[36:23] for you
[36:24] and it was with uh the word of God and
[36:28] how that Moses
[36:30] tried to lead the works of God and got
[36:33] to where he stuttered got to had a lot
[36:35] of problems in his life and when looking
[36:38] for Christ and found him on a
[36:40] Mountainside and said God I can't go on
[36:43] no more I stutter I stagger I do a lot
[36:47] God said how can you say that I made you
[36:50] and the thing of it is I have an ability
[36:52] to make you different Moses Moses said
[36:55] God I got a problem
[36:57] and God said I got your brother coming
[37:00] and he said from now on he said you will
[37:03] tell your brother those Saints
[37:06] amen the recipient set up
[37:08] over on the Mountainside God talking by
[37:11] a by a liner that was lit up by God
[37:17] how would you like to see that same
[37:19] Lantern lit up in your life
[37:22] you say it's not for me I believe it's
[37:24] all for me
[37:26] and as he stepped there and he talked to
[37:29] God about his difficulties that he had
[37:32] and his brother arrived on it
[37:35] they went on out looking to find a way
[37:37] to get the children of Israel delivered
[37:39] from pharaoh and all of his hosts
[37:43] and uh I began to think that as we look
[37:47] at him and we're looking for God talking
[37:51] to him the decisions that need to be
[37:53] made out of our life
[37:55] how many of you believe that God needs
[37:57] you and has his uses for you
[38:00] amen I believe he does I believe there's
[38:02] a purpose for us I believe we do it for
[38:05] that we preach for it we sing for it we
[38:07] talk for it we live for it and I I
[38:10] believe that that's true you either live
[38:12] or you don't live amen amen and I have
[38:15] to believe we're not Society type people
[38:18] how you like my tie
[38:19] that's not what we're talking about how
[38:21] you like my clothes or whatever it's not
[38:24] that I want just print it say something
[38:26] that will touch people's lives and say
[38:29] as for me he cares for me I care for him
[38:33] amen if he lives I live if he does I do
[38:38] amen and we're getting to a place that
[38:41] it's Rapture time and it's time we began
[38:44] to look at the things of God and as we
[38:47] bring up these issues to you there's
[38:50] reason for him
[38:51] in other words it it uh Moses told that
[38:55] Pharaoh he said we're going to destroy
[38:58] this place and you ought to understand
[39:00] by the signs of all the things that
[39:03] we've done we brought the fleas and the
[39:05] Flies and the bugs and we we just tore
[39:08] up your whole place and uh he said well
[39:11] he said I still can't deliver you and
[39:14] finally The Voice came from God to leave
[39:16] him anyway bring the hosts into and the
[39:20] children of Israel and get ready to
[39:22] leave
[39:23] and as you read those things and you
[39:25] begin to look at the purpose to them
[39:29] I said to myself
[39:32] what is he going to face to where are we
[39:35] going uh how many of you know that we're
[39:38] looking at some deep dark hours for
[39:41] America
[39:43] that's only about 10 handholds
[39:46] Grant we got earthquakes it's going to
[39:48] settle this place down like you can't
[39:50] believe
[39:51] and I I'm not here to scare you
[39:54] come on I'm here to tell you that God
[39:56] has got some gifts and offices that he's
[39:59] going to show
[40:01] and he did this to Moses
[40:03] and the thing of it is that the people
[40:05] never believed it some believed it but
[40:07] the word of God came to within 14 days
[40:10] he's going to shut down that water we're
[40:12] going to shut down that light
[40:14] he's going to kill the lamb
[40:17] kind of a strange thing but he did that
[40:19] just the same the word of God said and
[40:22] when he kills that lamb the lamb will no
[40:25] longer be able to offer
[40:27] like a dog a dog can do anything he
[40:30] wants to do at any time
[40:32] but when that is stripped from him he
[40:35] cannot do that and that's what it did to
[40:37] the lamb the lamb no longer could give
[40:39] no longer could do and it became more a
[40:43] demand that God laid upon their lives
[40:45] like being laid upon us it's not a game
[40:48] we're playing one of these days it's
[40:49] going to come to a greater point that
[40:52] you're going to have to be what it is
[40:54] that you hear these people preaching
[40:56] about and talking about
[40:58] amen Because He Lives we live
[41:01] and the example is laid out before us I
[41:05] believe as we see the word of God and
[41:07] what it did it finally drove Moses to
[41:10] doing what he had to do all those
[41:12] enemies and all those tests against the
[41:15] Pharaoh in his army had to show up and
[41:19] away from town he moved
[41:22] and I think on those changes I look at
[41:25] my life and I begin to to judge it
[41:28] because I'm a human being and uh we've
[41:31] lived off our life a good life can you
[41:33] say Amen to that amen we've had our ways
[41:36] in about everything we've wanted to do
[41:38] and it comes difficult sometimes when
[41:42] it's time to do what God asks you to do
[41:45] to pay the price and serving God is
[41:48] something that requires doing that I
[41:51] thought to see the one I wanted to ask
[41:53] was how many of you need to get baptized
[41:56] some people say well it's not necessary
[41:58] but it is amen there's a lot of things
[42:02] that goes into the lesson and as I was
[42:06] reading this and I want to say that the
[42:10] sermon that we're talking about here is
[42:13] who do you say this melchized it is
[42:18] and the thing of it is all of a sudden
[42:20] he begins to show up in our life
[42:23] who do you think God is
[42:26] what are our responsibilities what do
[42:30] things mean something to us uh and I
[42:34] think of those things and I think about
[42:36] Melchizedek and I think about how did he
[42:40] call the children of Israel together and
[42:42] I thought about Moses and I thought
[42:44] about those things that he did what an
[42:47] hour it is that we live in
[42:50] because they're laid to us who is this
[42:54] Melchizedek
[42:56] there's something that's been put on the
[42:58] screen that has began
[43:00] and continues to go even today can you
[43:03] say Amen to that I may miss up on a few
[43:06] of those words but I believe that's true
[43:09] a certain day come and all of a sudden
[43:12] here comes uh uh the cane walking down
[43:16] the street Abraham and a man walks up to
[43:21] him says how you doing Abraham he said
[43:24] I'm doing good just on the way home from
[43:26] a battle
[43:27] and he said I'm Melchizedek
[43:30] and I can see him as he said you know
[43:32] you may not know who I am but I brought
[43:35] you from the land of all
[43:38] and I brought you down to where your mom
[43:40] and daddies are
[43:42] and for some reason or another you moved
[43:45] over to another land
[43:47] and that's where I know where you're at
[43:49] because I directed you to do that
[43:52] and now I see you well who are you sir
[43:56] he said I am Melchizedek
[44:00] amen a man that never had a mother never
[44:03] had a father never had a sister or a
[44:06] brother nothing less but the almighty
[44:10] God stood before him
[44:13] and what an identification it brought to
[44:17] the man that was there
[44:19] and he said my my mind he turned around
[44:22] and gave him a percent of the battle
[44:25] that he just came through and he said
[44:27] thank you
[44:29] and as we begin to look at his life
[44:32] you know that that life began to do
[44:35] business with him and I began to think
[44:37] about him and I think about his life and
[44:42] you know he went and met that melchized
[44:45] egg and he said sir he said I'm feeling
[44:46] good
[44:48] but he said I got no inheritance I got
[44:51] nothing
[44:53] and all of a sudden he begins to tell
[44:55] that
[44:57] Abraham just exactly who I am what I can
[45:01] do and I'm going to change your life and
[45:04] did he not begin to change his life amen
[45:07] the seed will not be here with the shuck
[45:10] amen there was so long that he had to do
[45:13] what he did but he began to change God
[45:15] began to build that vessel into a vessel
[45:18] of Life how many of you want that in
[45:21] your life you want to live for God you
[45:23] want to do for God not just here to to
[45:27] come to church if we could say that but
[45:30] to be Sons and Daughters of God
[45:33] that's where Abraham was he said sir he
[45:36] said I I just nothing he said I got a
[45:39] couple people that live in my house but
[45:41] nothing
[45:42] he said I'll tell you what you do you
[45:43] take a goat you dig a lamb you take this
[45:48] and you lay it out in front of you and
[45:51] you cut it in two and you take those
[45:53] birds and you let it do what it's doing
[45:55] now listen to this huh and he did all
[45:58] that and I think to myself you know I
[46:01] don't know what he thought while he
[46:03] watched it
[46:04] but he stood there and watched it until
[46:07] it got night time and he continued to
[46:10] drive away the enemy that kept eating on
[46:13] it so that it might come to being but
[46:16] all of a sudden without fail
[46:19] God poured out a blessing upon his life
[46:27] bigger than you can imagine
[46:31] put a seed in him
[46:33] that would believe everything that God
[46:37] had to say
[46:39] and I think sometimes in our life it's
[46:42] very difficult to believe what God says
[46:46] it's like Sarah
[46:47] I'll get a woman and she'll survey you
[46:51] and you can have a baby and what have
[46:53] you but that's not what he said you be
[46:56] the Daddy I'll Be The Watcher and here
[46:59] we are that same life is here today the
[47:03] the promotions and the express that God
[47:06] is showing people are are not expressing
[47:09] it or living it and ought to set you
[47:12] alive with it
[47:14] excuse me for being cruel but it is the
[47:16] truth
[47:19] and so we look at him and I taught all
[47:22] of a sudden something began to happen
[47:25] the life of God began to fill those
[47:27] sacrifices that he had
[47:30] began to tell his changes life he became
[47:33] a seed man he became a man of God he
[47:37] believed it and whatever God was saying
[47:40] to me as I read it and we'll talk about
[47:43] some of it to me all I could see was as
[47:47] the day's turn
[47:48] it changed the man
[47:52] how many of you can experience a fee in
[47:56] your life
[47:57] changes that are going on
[48:00] it's more and money
[48:02] it's more houses and lands
[48:06] amen you said you live for him and your
[48:09] mind ought to talk the original Talk
[48:12] not what man would say but what God
[48:15] would say we ought to believe what God
[48:17] has said and not what man has said and
[48:20] we would come to church we would see
[48:22] more of him than anything else
[48:26] and once again I'm not being critical
[48:28] but I'm telling you when you look at the
[48:31] life that this man began to live
[48:34] and like we say about his wife
[48:37] and Abraham he's he's just standing
[48:40] there one day and all of a sudden he
[48:43] spear walked up three men walked up you
[48:45] remember that
[48:47] and he looked at all three men he looked
[48:49] at him and called him my Lord
[48:51] he recognized out of one of them to be
[48:54] that one that was the countered
[48:57] amen when when lot met him just a little
[49:01] bit later the two of them going down
[49:03] there he called them hit their Lords he
[49:05] didn't even identify who it was
[49:08] friends I would ask you today how many
[49:10] of you know why you're here
[49:13] yes
[49:14] you said we're in the wave at you but
[49:16] what can I do for you
[49:19] we serve a ribs in Christ
[49:22] and that's what we ask we want to live
[49:25] for him
[49:26] amen just like
[49:28] Moses did just like Abraham did and
[49:31] Abraham's looking there and all of a
[49:33] sudden God makes him a promise
[49:36] and he said you're a seed you're a
[49:39] spiritual man
[49:40] come with me
[49:42] walked on in there and began to
[49:45] conversation with him he said I'm going
[49:46] to bless you
[49:48] I'm going to give you that boy and
[49:51] Sarah's going to have him he says that
[49:53] Sarah's so old he said and I'm sold but
[49:56] it doesn't make any difference how many
[49:58] of you think you went beyond
[50:03] friends today all things are possible
[50:07] and the thing of it is is that Abraham
[50:09] listened to what he said to Sarah he
[50:12] said sir we're going to visit you
[50:14] well Sarah said well you know if I'm
[50:16] married this other gal or got her and
[50:19] and what we'll do with her is I'll just
[50:21] give her to Abraham and he can take and
[50:24] get a baby out of her and uh things can
[50:28] change and I wanna I wanna say something
[50:30] how many of you know that baby making
[50:33] like with God will change family babies
[50:40] babies are born and they come anointed
[50:44] by God at Birth is that right
[50:48] that's right they come of God they
[50:50] become what God has put together God has
[50:53] created it God has ordained it and when
[50:55] that baby is born that born that baby
[50:58] has got the life of God in his life
[51:03] and it either goes on to me God goes on
[51:05] to be what God would have it and so I
[51:08] think a lot of times in our life we'll
[51:10] do it just a baby or it's just this but
[51:12] that's not soul I mean they come from
[51:15] God they're put together by God and it's
[51:18] put there by a man
[51:19] man gives a seed to the woman the woman
[51:22] gives the seed and the baby's there but
[51:24] without that there wouldn't be I want to
[51:26] tell you about the father your Lord and
[51:29] Savior Jesus Christ and how he'll change
[51:32] your life
[51:33] huh
[51:35] for today we're living in the who is
[51:38] this Melchizedek where is that
[51:40] manifestation of father son Holy Spirit
[51:44] who is that one that can deliver that to
[51:48] your thinking and change our minds and
[51:50] hearts where we need him
[51:54] and that's exactly what we're looking
[51:56] for
[51:57] and I think of
[51:59] Abraham when he went and had that baby
[52:03] and Sarah she thought it was a good
[52:05] thing but he was just a young man that
[52:08] never did things right he was a mean and
[52:10] contrary
[52:12] and finally he
[52:14] sent him on down the street with his
[52:16] mama you remember that and he said God
[52:19] will bless you God will watch over you
[52:20] but
[52:21] it didn't make it so he had to finally
[52:24] meet up with Hannah
[52:25] or Sarah and we find out that Sarah then
[52:29] had a baby amen from the seed of life
[52:32] from Abraham can you say amen and then
[52:36] out of that man came the evidence that
[52:39] we have that from him came to the
[52:41] Natural man that God filled and made a
[52:43] community made a world
[52:47] and I I believe that through those
[52:49] things that God has done God has made us
[52:52] and I when you when you look at those
[52:56] promises and you look and see what God
[52:58] has done
[53:00] you know I I think of
[53:02] God's going about his business and God
[53:05] said you know what I'd like you to do I
[53:07] want you to take your boy now
[53:09] and I want you to take him up and I want
[53:11] you to
[53:12] offer him up on the mountain
[53:15] and you know he tells his people that
[53:18] worked for him he said a couple of them
[53:20] get ready we're going
[53:22] he went out and took his boy with him
[53:26] huh amen and on a day or two out there
[53:30] all of a sudden he sees a mountain
[53:33] something about that mountain turned on
[53:35] his life
[53:37] he said sir stop it right here I've got
[53:41] to go up that mountain and I will take
[53:43] the boy with me
[53:45] you stay here we'll take up the fire
[53:48] we'll take up the stone we'll take up
[53:50] everything
[53:51] and he goes up there and they look for
[53:53] lamb and don't see a lamb and Abraham
[53:56] begins to put the place together
[53:59] begins to get it all ready and puts his
[54:01] boy up on there and raises that knife to
[54:04] drive that knife into his bosom
[54:06] and an angel of the Lord spoke up don't
[54:09] do that
[54:11] even because he said there is a lamb
[54:14] that is hidden and he I can see him as
[54:17] he looks out there and just in short
[54:19] ways here was a lamb caught in the
[54:21] thicket
[54:22] amen because of the workings of God the
[54:26] the attitude that that man served God to
[54:30] do what God asked him to do and what God
[54:33] did
[54:33] and he said we want and don't want to do
[54:36] like that we're going to do we're going
[54:38] to bring in other people to do these
[54:41] same things so just finish doing what
[54:45] you're doing and Beyond
[54:46] and as I look at that I begin to think
[54:49] and who is this Melchizedek
[54:53] who is he that has manifested himself in
[54:58] the father in the son and God
[55:01] who is he not not one here one there but
[55:05] the same person the same one
[55:08] I would ask you how many of you know him
[55:11] today
[55:12] how many is that experience been made
[55:15] real to your eye
[55:18] and as we look at the words and the
[55:21] evidences here as we look at them it
[55:24] ought to change our life
[55:26] and make our life different I I began to
[55:29] look at it and I said I got to do this
[55:31] and that and then all of a sudden I get
[55:33] in the seed will not become here with
[55:36] the shuck
[55:37] I said Thank You Jesus
[55:40] there's not enough of anything I can do
[55:42] to change him but there is a God that
[55:44] can make things different
[55:45] and that's exactly what he can do to her
[55:48] life he can make us different and make
[55:50] us what God would have us to be
[55:53] and we ought to start looking for that
[55:55] evidence and you say well I serve God
[55:57] then you ought to know who the servant
[55:59] is who your helper is you say well I got
[56:02] to go get him he's not the second person
[56:04] of the godhead or the third person he's
[56:07] at South same God all the way through
[56:09] one God many purposes to fulfill that
[56:14] life for you or I can you say Amen to
[56:16] that amen we live and serve and become
[56:20] to me every time you take a step you're
[56:24] made aware of an ongoing thing that God
[56:27] has for us
[56:28] you're looking at a grave you're looking
[56:30] at a resurrection
[56:33] amen you're promised one of these days
[56:35] if anything happens you'll be found on
[56:37] the other side is that true how many of
[56:40] you are looking forward to that how many
[56:42] of you know that's a promise when
[56:44] everybody looks at you they shake your
[56:46] head like you're a nobody but you are
[56:48] his amen and he spends his time identify
[56:53] himself to his people to the one that is
[56:57] carrying the the the token I want that
[57:01] token in you I want it alive in you I
[57:05] want it talking to you I want to live it
[57:07] in yet it's alive it's it's we got jobs
[57:11] we got a lot of things but your real job
[57:13] is him
[57:15] serving him in the power of his
[57:17] resurrection
[57:19] we come to church sometimes and can't
[57:22] hardly raise them we come to church
[57:25] don't hardly have a thank you Jesus amen
[57:28] that cares in the problems are getting
[57:30] us down is that the way it's going to be
[57:34] amen it ought to be something that we
[57:37] look forward to that hour that lays just
[57:39] ahead and those things that you see made
[57:42] evidence
[57:47] and when you look at those things like
[57:49] we talked about having them children
[57:52] how that the wolf wife don't have much
[57:54] to do with it but she has a water blood
[57:56] and spirit that has things to do with it
[57:58] when the baby becomes alive
[58:00] a lot of things become changed a lot of
[58:03] things ideas become real and we begin to
[58:07] look and to see God like God would have
[58:10] us and that's what I think today the put
[58:13] the purpose in the uh
[58:17] thing that God has a token it takes God
[58:20] to put it in your life how many of you
[58:23] want it working
[58:25] how many of you know that God puts it
[58:28] there to take care when the issue comes
[58:30] up you got the finances to take care of
[58:33] it
[58:34] amen it's like you have to have a token
[58:36] to get on an airplane you present the
[58:39] plane the money and then they give them
[58:41] the token and you get in then when we
[58:44] have that token that token lives in you
[58:47] had token is alive in you amen not here
[58:51] not not but the Sheck but you're you're
[58:53] somebody in Christ
[58:57] yes it ought to change our life
[59:01] and ought to put a hope way down deep in
[59:03] our our life and so as we look at some
[59:06] of these issues I'm reminded constantly
[59:09] about the things that God has done with
[59:12] us to make us what we are you say about
[59:15] the hour that we live in
[59:17] amen he promised that token would be
[59:20] alive
[59:21] when you need pavement you write that
[59:24] token with me there and so to me what it
[59:27] does it begins to tell to me the answer
[59:29] of it who is this Melchizedek
[59:34] who is his father
[59:36] the one that you call Father one you
[59:39] call the son
[59:41] when you call and you fail to recognize
[59:44] that he is
[59:45] that father
[59:47] Son and Holy Ghost in him is that power
[59:52] and that life that we have
[59:55] and I think as we look at this and they
[59:58] begin to consider it
[1:00:02] it changes your life how many of you
[1:00:05] know
[1:00:06] by what you know is where your strength
[1:00:09] is
[1:00:11] when you know he lives then you know you
[1:00:15] have strength
[1:00:17] then you ought to be able not just to
[1:00:20] say it but you ought to know that God
[1:00:24] Lives in You
[1:00:26] whether you're sleeping or walking you
[1:00:29] know that's true
[1:00:31] and I believe that as we look things in
[1:00:34] our life we begin to see we need God in
[1:00:38] our life we need him to move with our
[1:00:39] family we need him to move in our
[1:00:41] businesses we need a lot of things we
[1:00:44] need God alive in our lives
[1:00:47] and I begin to look at these other men
[1:00:49] and their lives such as the seed will
[1:00:54] not be aired with a shuck I begin to
[1:00:57] look at our life how many of you know
[1:00:59] what you learn is what you call I know
[1:01:02] he lives
[1:01:05] do you know he lives
[1:01:08] you say yes I do because
[1:01:11] my life is different than it was
[1:01:14] and my life and my problems are become
[1:01:17] different so you learn two things three
[1:01:20] things for or is he alive in you as he
[1:01:23] is there and so as we begin to study the
[1:01:27] word of God and we begin to look
[1:01:30] I believe it's just like I think about
[1:01:33] uh
[1:01:34] the prophet of our hour and how that he
[1:01:37] met the Lord up in the mountain
[1:01:39] and he said Lord he said I'd like you to
[1:01:41] get those squirrels
[1:01:44] and God said I ain't got no squirrels
[1:01:48] amen he said to him you've got the
[1:01:50] squirrels
[1:01:55] you see and he said you talk a little
[1:01:58] bit more he said if you get those
[1:01:59] squirrels he said I don't know where
[1:02:01] they're at
[1:02:03] he made another statement I never had
[1:02:05] them
[1:02:07] and he was down on the tree before that
[1:02:11] you remember
[1:02:12] and God said what are you doing here he
[1:02:14] said I'm hunting where you hunting he
[1:02:16] said sheep or uh squirrels and he said
[1:02:20] where you want them
[1:02:22] he said I want one on that branch I
[1:02:25] wanted to come down that Mountainside
[1:02:28] yeah right amen and I mean that I tell
[1:02:31] that devil did you get what I got I'm
[1:02:34] telling you get out of my life get out
[1:02:36] of my sight get out of my being
[1:02:39] Because He Lives
[1:02:41] you say y'all lower your voice
[1:02:46] friends when you know who he's there and
[1:02:48] you know what's going it's the voice
[1:02:51] amen anybody that needs to know he lives
[1:02:54] is
[1:02:56] and once you know he lives
[1:02:58] once you know he's there amen you will
[1:03:02] pull back the news and you will say it
[1:03:04] like you mean it with all your heart
[1:03:07] amen it's not we doing it it's him doing
[1:03:10] it it's we needing it
[1:03:14] that's why he said to Abraham how are
[1:03:17] you brother well he said just got back
[1:03:19] from the war how'd you do all we wanted
[1:03:23] well who are you sir he said I'm
[1:03:25] Melchizedek he said you know I brought
[1:03:28] you down in the family and I took you
[1:03:30] over here to this land he said I'm just
[1:03:32] going to do things Mama
[1:03:34] friends what would this church be like
[1:03:37] if we was to hear more of those things
[1:03:39] stressed in our heart and life you are
[1:03:43] his amen you're greater he that lives in
[1:03:46] you than he lives in the world
[1:03:49] so he tells that God he said God yeah I
[1:03:52] want my squirrels
[1:03:55] and the thing of it is is that when you
[1:03:57] begin to read what he's saying the angel
[1:04:00] of the Lord is telling him he said the
[1:04:02] squirrels are yours
[1:04:07] I think of that and I say to myself all
[1:04:10] right
[1:04:11] down to the mountain he goes
[1:04:14] and he said I want those squirrels back
[1:04:18] he said and I want that squirrel to come
[1:04:20] back I want you to come down here and
[1:04:22] then did he follow him he did
[1:04:26] and then the second one in other words
[1:04:28] he called them
[1:04:30] and can I ask you a question
[1:04:32] does not the god that you serve and live
[1:04:35] by do you not talk to him
[1:04:39] do you not call his name and require
[1:04:42] things out of his life
[1:04:45] will you not repeat sometime what you
[1:04:48] heard me say
[1:04:50] that God said that those shiver for
[1:04:52] those squirrels were not his but they
[1:04:55] belong to you I had already gave them to
[1:04:58] you so you can't find them speak the
[1:05:01] word you'll get it
[1:05:04] and all of a sudden we begin to change
[1:05:07] our attitude towards God hallelujah
[1:05:12] Because He Lives
[1:05:16] amen he called that squirrel down that
[1:05:19] squirrel come down and he landed on that
[1:05:21] mountain and he shot him
[1:05:24] and he said to himself then there's
[1:05:26] another one there and he said I want him
[1:05:28] to come down
[1:05:30] for the seed and the shuck ain't gonna
[1:05:32] matter
[1:05:34] God separated them
[1:05:37] and so he stood there and he said I want
[1:05:39] that squirrel to come down there I
[1:05:41] wanted to come out over here want him to
[1:05:43] come down here I want him here and I
[1:05:45] know that they won't get in that poison
[1:05:47] plant like that is but I want that
[1:05:49] squirrel to rise in that pointed uh Bush
[1:05:53] and get out there on that bush and hear
[1:05:55] that squirrel came down
[1:05:58] and all I'm asking you
[1:06:01] brothers and sisters if you know he's a
[1:06:03] liver how about talking to him if you
[1:06:07] know who he is it ought to change our
[1:06:09] heart and life that's what we're talking
[1:06:11] about he never stayed the same he
[1:06:14] identified himself to URI as God
[1:06:17] almighty
[1:06:19] is that right amen and he ought to be so
[1:06:23] real to you or I today
[1:06:25] amen that we claim things for God
[1:06:29] but anyway they come down there and he
[1:06:31] said thank you and he's shouting
[1:06:34] he gathers those two squirrels up
[1:06:37] takes them down to the car and goes out
[1:06:39] and something says to him hey
[1:06:42] what about that third one
[1:06:45] oh he said I forgot it because it was
[1:06:49] done differently
[1:06:51] and I say to you that have lived for him
[1:06:54] hey
[1:06:57] you know him
[1:07:02] and that's what he did he went back the
[1:07:05] next day and he got a hold of that
[1:07:08] other squirrel which was promised
[1:07:11] and you know he goes home and he said
[1:07:13] Brethren I don't know how these things
[1:07:16] come about but he said because of what I
[1:07:20] said those squirrels were there
[1:07:23] and you say to me brother Patterson I
[1:07:26] don't know why it was but all I did was
[1:07:29] ask somebody something
[1:07:30] and I'll tell you something when I got
[1:07:33] home it was so real to me I can't
[1:07:36] believe it
[1:07:37] I sit in the house of God where we're
[1:07:40] sitting here now
[1:07:41] and worried about what's on TV at home
[1:07:44] or you want to hear what God's got
[1:07:47] huh and you say I want to hear what I
[1:07:52] have heard God say friends I've heard a
[1:07:54] lot of precious things from my heavenly
[1:07:58] father
[1:08:00] and he's told me many times that he
[1:08:03] loved me
[1:08:05] and I sang you a song this morning and
[1:08:08] you sang to me he
[1:08:11] cares for you
[1:08:14] sing it with all your heart
[1:08:17] because I got needs
[1:08:20] I got family
[1:08:22] I got things we need you said well
[1:08:25] brother Patterson maybe I need to go
[1:08:27] down and get some money and do it that's
[1:08:29] all up to you but I'm telling you that
[1:08:32] once you learn of him
[1:08:34] you begin to learn of him
[1:08:37] friends if you spoke squirrels into
[1:08:40] existence would you not learn how to
[1:08:44] speak squirrels into existence
[1:08:48] would you not know how to call God on
[1:08:50] the scene
[1:08:52] huh would you not there it's not
[1:08:56] something that you have to work for but
[1:08:58] that's exactly with him
[1:09:01] he takes his deacons and he goes home to
[1:09:04] Hannah
[1:09:06] he was her name she was their little
[1:09:08] woman
[1:09:10] and he's standing there and he's having
[1:09:12] dinner he said I spoke to them squirrels
[1:09:16] and I brought him to where they were and
[1:09:19] I shot him
[1:09:20] but how did I get him there
[1:09:23] how did I get him
[1:09:26] and they could not answer
[1:09:28] because what it is was that they were
[1:09:30] spoken there he was speaking to him they
[1:09:34] were his something was going on
[1:09:37] he realized that because God Lives I
[1:09:40] live because God made a promise it's to
[1:09:44] you as well as it is to me
[1:09:49] maybe screaming too loud
[1:09:52] but he said ladies and men he said tell
[1:09:55] me please
[1:09:57] how did what I say bring those squirrels
[1:10:00] into existence
[1:10:02] and I'll guarantee you what if the word
[1:10:05] of God is true and the the Melchizedek
[1:10:08] and God that's walking around here today
[1:10:10] just like this and you get to talking to
[1:10:14] him he'll Square them shoulders and
[1:10:15] he'll start walking around like he owns
[1:10:17] this place
[1:10:18] and he'll say what's your problem son
[1:10:22] use everybody say that to you I say if
[1:10:25] you have any kind of life at all you've
[1:10:28] met him
[1:10:30] one two ah
[1:10:32] you are a medium
[1:10:34] and he said the same God I met there is
[1:10:37] the same God I meet here
[1:10:40] he's not a new God he's a God that said
[1:10:43] that I'll never leave you I'll never
[1:10:46] forsake you but I'll go with you to the
[1:10:48] very end
[1:10:51] and the thing of it is this little lady
[1:10:53] said I don't know we don't know
[1:10:56] he said well I I just don't know he said
[1:10:58] I just
[1:10:59] and I shot him
[1:11:01] he said what do you think of that sister
[1:11:03] Hattie
[1:11:04] and he said sir
[1:11:06] he said I need my boys saved
[1:11:13] huh
[1:11:17] friends I'll tell you something how many
[1:11:19] of you believe God heard reply
[1:11:23] how many of you believe her boys found
[1:11:26] its place at the meal house
[1:11:28] and met God there that day at that hour
[1:11:33] I want to ask you the same reason
[1:11:36] you say how is that you know there was a
[1:11:39] woman one day she told Jesus he met her
[1:11:42] I won't turn over there and quote it but
[1:11:45] he said something well you know the dogs
[1:11:47] eat the crumbs that fall from the
[1:11:49] master's table
[1:11:51] and the great God huh
[1:11:55] Melchizedek
[1:11:57] he makes a statement I never heard
[1:12:00] nothing like that
[1:12:01] is that what he said
[1:12:03] he said I never heard that and because
[1:12:06] you said it
[1:12:09] your daughters made well
[1:12:11] and I'm going to get on about my job
[1:12:14] only a little bit different because of
[1:12:18] what you said to me
[1:12:19] and I say to you today in making that
[1:12:22] statement it's got to be deeper than
[1:12:25] than what we can imagine
[1:12:28] greater is he that's in you than he
[1:12:30] that's in the world somewhere another
[1:12:31] the reality of it
[1:12:34] ought to come into place and ought to
[1:12:36] change our heart and life
[1:12:38] she made that statement she said my boys
[1:12:41] need to get saved my boys need to get
[1:12:43] saved immediately
[1:12:45] God filled them with the Holy Spirit God
[1:12:48] changed their life
[1:12:50] just like the little woman that made her
[1:12:52] statement and I I begin to
[1:12:55] look at some of those statements
[1:12:58] and the things that God is doing in our
[1:13:01] life
[1:13:03] you know it's
[1:13:05] it's a shame sometimes I just ask you
[1:13:07] how many of you need to be baptized in
[1:13:10] the Lord Jesus Christ not father son
[1:13:12] Holy Ghost
[1:13:14] if you haven't got it right you need to
[1:13:15] get right if there's more that come in
[1:13:17] here in Saturday or Sunday amen needs to
[1:13:20] be asked the same thing how many of you
[1:13:22] need to get saved we're baptized we want
[1:13:24] to get some of those things taken care
[1:13:26] of you might say I don't know what it is
[1:13:29] but I'm talking about we're talking
[1:13:31] about a God that promise said I will not
[1:13:33] allow the seat in the shuck to grow
[1:13:36] together
[1:13:37] amen you don't have to prove a lot of
[1:13:39] trash because he lives so are you get
[1:13:43] happy be what God would make you to be
[1:13:45] and so we look these things in our life
[1:13:48] and who is this Melchizedek he's still
[1:13:51] living
[1:13:53] amen the church comes up and said well
[1:13:55] he's three people and one God
[1:13:58] brother Brown said how can that be
[1:14:00] three persons in one
[1:14:03] he said that's not so it's one person in
[1:14:07] three positions he's the father he's the
[1:14:10] son and he's the Holy Ghost amen when
[1:14:13] you talk to the Lord Jesus Christ you
[1:14:15] ought to know when he was born he wasn't
[1:14:17] born of a man like everybody else was by
[1:14:20] sex he was born by God huh
[1:14:24] without anything there but him
[1:14:27] and here he is today making an Evidence
[1:14:30] to you or I there's a reason that those
[1:14:32] things are put there is so that you and
[1:14:35] I know who it is
[1:14:37] friends if anybody's ahead in this it's
[1:14:40] him
[1:14:41] if anybody knows when he's coming it's
[1:14:43] him
[1:14:44] amen and what we need to know are those
[1:14:47] things but I begin to look at the word
[1:14:51] of God and by some of these things
[1:14:54] and I thought maybe that the Brethren
[1:14:57] had those
[1:14:59] uh scriptures on if but if they don't
[1:15:02] have it we can read them but I wanted to
[1:15:05] read about him and what he said about it
[1:15:07] can we do it
[1:15:09] for this Melchizedek came to Salem
[1:15:16] Priests of the most high God
[1:15:19] who me Abraham returning from the
[1:15:22] slaughter of the Kings and blessed him
[1:15:25] to whom again Abraham gave a tenth part
[1:15:28] of all
[1:15:29] first being the interpreted the king of
[1:15:32] righteousness
[1:15:34] and after that also king of Salem
[1:15:37] which is the king of Peace imagine he's
[1:15:41] looking at this
[1:15:42] how many of you or I realize just who
[1:15:46] alive he is and how might he is
[1:15:51] without father without mother
[1:15:54] without descent neither beginning of day
[1:15:57] nor end of life
[1:16:02] but made like an unto the Son of God
[1:16:05] applied the priests continually
[1:16:09] I think if a guy could read that every
[1:16:11] day no matter what kind of opposition
[1:16:13] you would have it would give you victory
[1:16:16] because he lives and I can see Abraham
[1:16:19] as he turned around and met him I can
[1:16:22] see him as he said I brought you home
[1:16:25] I'm the one who did this and I'm going
[1:16:28] to change your life
[1:16:30] and as we're looking at those today here
[1:16:32] and I think that what a change it ought
[1:16:36] to make in our life
[1:16:39] and as I read I begin to see and to
[1:16:41] think about him so I begin to read a
[1:16:44] little bit more who is Melchizedek
[1:16:48] and who's the things that he met and I'd
[1:16:50] like to ex made mention of those things
[1:16:53] because we're
[1:16:55] wanting a token and we're wanting it
[1:16:58] alive
[1:16:59] we want to live separately from the
[1:17:02] shock we want the seed to be here how
[1:17:07] many of you know that Ishmael I believe
[1:17:10] it was was Abraham's boy
[1:17:13] and he was the one that everybody
[1:17:15] followed but Abraham was like that he
[1:17:18] was the seed man he was the man that
[1:17:21] knew God
[1:17:23] from the beginning to the end
[1:17:25] and those are the things that we're
[1:17:27] talking about here like we talked about
[1:17:29] the squirrels talk about healing what
[1:17:32] brings about healing
[1:17:34] and in the end of this sermon who is
[1:17:37] this Melchizedek how many of you can
[1:17:40] remember what was preached
[1:17:45] he preached I think it was three or four
[1:17:47] sermons their marriage and divorce
[1:17:51] people who troubled with that for many
[1:17:53] years and God spoke to them on marriage
[1:17:57] and divorce he broke the message to it
[1:18:00] made an understanding to them about what
[1:18:03] God thought about you being married to
[1:18:05] another woman that wasn't the one you
[1:18:07] were just married to and his purpose and
[1:18:10] those things put out instead of Dying by
[1:18:13] all the problem why don't you spend some
[1:18:15] time getting things straightened out by
[1:18:18] God
[1:18:19] and I said all right Lord let us do
[1:18:22] things that the way you'd have done
[1:18:25] and so I began to look at this and every
[1:18:27] time I see him I see that word of God
[1:18:30] changed and made more alive today than
[1:18:34] we can ever imagine let me just turn
[1:18:36] over here if I can here
[1:18:39] he said now as we approach the word how
[1:18:42] many of you believe in the word of God
[1:18:46] can I tell you something if you got a
[1:18:48] denominational attitude you don't know
[1:18:50] the word
[1:18:53] you may call it the word but you don't
[1:18:56] know it
[1:18:57] so what you do is you learn who it is
[1:19:01] because God will not deal with you if
[1:19:04] you don't use the word
[1:19:09] huh and I think sometimes we don't use
[1:19:14] the word
[1:19:15] Lord you promised us you said this we do
[1:19:20] this
[1:19:21] and I'm not picking I'm just trying to
[1:19:23] get across the thought to you and to me
[1:19:28] but this is what he said
[1:19:31] he said that approach the written word
[1:19:34] we ask that and you take the written
[1:19:36] word and you make it live to us tonight
[1:19:40] friends I think that's what he did
[1:19:42] that's not my squirrel that's yours
[1:19:45] it's the word of God
[1:19:47] friends you can read this and it goes in
[1:19:50] one ear and out the other
[1:19:52] and then on the other hand you can read
[1:19:54] it to where it changes your life
[1:19:57] amen there's passages here that to
[1:20:00] understand these things like that woman
[1:20:02] that told the Lord something he said
[1:20:06] and all of Israel have never heard that
[1:20:09] voice so go home your daughters heel now
[1:20:12] and so everything is all right I think
[1:20:15] it's the same thing we're hearing today
[1:20:17] as we see these things but listen to
[1:20:19] what he sets it up
[1:20:21] and then while reading the first three
[1:20:23] verses and then he begins to talk about
[1:20:26] he said think of the great person
[1:20:30] I mean think about how great he is
[1:20:32] father
[1:20:34] son Holy Ghost
[1:20:38] you're talking to the father
[1:20:42] worth anything
[1:20:45] talking to the son
[1:20:47] worth anything
[1:20:49] talking to the Holy Spirit
[1:20:52] addressing him in a measure that you
[1:20:55] would have him dressed in
[1:20:58] oh God I personally want to know him
[1:21:01] better
[1:21:02] amen I want to be like I want the token
[1:21:07] I want to live with the power of God
[1:21:10] say well the enemy broke me but I'll
[1:21:12] tell you something that God put the
[1:21:14] payday in the
[1:21:16] till
[1:21:17] and no matter what that enemy does to
[1:21:19] you the token will take care of the
[1:21:22] problem
[1:21:23] but you don't put the token in there he
[1:21:25] cannot solve the problem
[1:21:27] so get it in there make sure God knows
[1:21:31] it's there and we live in that you say
[1:21:34] well I don't want to be like Moses and I
[1:21:36] don't want to be like that but let me
[1:21:38] ask you a question
[1:21:39] amen there was all those men
[1:21:43] they all give up that idea ten men gave
[1:21:46] up that idea two men stayed with that
[1:21:48] token
[1:21:50] and a little old Harlot a harlot
[1:21:54] met him
[1:21:55] sir what are you doing well and he began
[1:21:58] to explain the Tolkien
[1:22:01] and he said you'll put this in your
[1:22:02] windowsill
[1:22:04] do not cross it leave it do not do this
[1:22:08] with it but you hold it where it is
[1:22:11] and it'll stay true
[1:22:13] and when this place comes down ten of
[1:22:15] them didn't believe it
[1:22:17] Joshua and another man did and they
[1:22:21] lived the other ten died
[1:22:23] but did it work or didn't it yes it did
[1:22:28] she may not understood but I'll
[1:22:29] guarantee she held on to that token
[1:22:33] and I'll guarantee you something when
[1:22:34] you realize that token is on you that
[1:22:36] will pay for every bill you got
[1:22:39] it I'd make sure I had him
[1:22:42] and the power of his resurrection let
[1:22:44] the
[1:22:46] anybody let the guy come in to bury you
[1:22:49] but I tell my wife don't look for me
[1:22:52] under grass honey because I ain't going
[1:22:54] to be under grass
[1:22:55] I'm going up
[1:22:57] amen as for me it's crimes you say
[1:22:59] Michael that's just nonsense but you'd
[1:23:02] be surprised how I like that
[1:23:06] because I know he knows me
[1:23:09] you say you're such a wonderful person
[1:23:12] I have to say that's not true
[1:23:15] but I talked to my papa
[1:23:18] and my daddy knows who I am
[1:23:22] en and things begin to make change and
[1:23:25] our life begins to to add to this and as
[1:23:29] we begin to look at our life
[1:23:31] and some of these things I'm trying to
[1:23:33] repeat to you about the person
[1:23:37] and he said in another side that uh he
[1:23:40] was a priesthood and he said that was
[1:23:43] melchizedek's priesthood they called him
[1:23:45] a priesthood because men were joined up
[1:23:47] to it he said he is father son Holy
[1:23:52] Ghost he is the fullness of that
[1:23:54] priesthood no greater than him how many
[1:23:57] of you know him the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:59] born huh
[1:24:01] amen born of God himself that we might
[1:24:05] have him live in our life
[1:24:08] don't know how long we've been talking
[1:24:12] but let me just read a few more things
[1:24:14] here
[1:24:15] he said and the person is eternal if you
[1:24:18] notice he had no father he had no mother
[1:24:22] he has no other things
[1:24:25] and he has no time
[1:24:29] that's even endured
[1:24:31] either who is this that shall live
[1:24:34] tonight because the Bible says here that
[1:24:38] neither father nor mother nor beginning
[1:24:40] of day nor ending of life in other words
[1:24:43] that he's alive
[1:24:46] and let me just say something we're
[1:24:48] going to close this out
[1:24:50] but you know when God said and you hear
[1:24:52] the word and you're a theologian
[1:24:55] can I tell you most theologians do not
[1:24:58] know the word
[1:25:00] they know a Bible
[1:25:03] but they don't know the word
[1:25:06] therefore they don't quote it like it's
[1:25:09] supposed to be
[1:25:11] and I say that to you or I as we look at
[1:25:15] this through the who is this Melchizedek
[1:25:18] he's telling the people now
[1:25:21] at night time God puts uh hanky over
[1:25:25] this will say and he said that a lot of
[1:25:29] times whatever God don't want revealed
[1:25:31] he put the hanky over you don't see it
[1:25:34] but isn't that what they did when when
[1:25:37] uh born can't think of the thought to
[1:25:39] put that one that uh
[1:25:42] worked on that
[1:25:45] body so much
[1:25:47] created him alive created him before God
[1:25:51] but anyway we see that this man here
[1:25:54] doing these same things but God covers
[1:25:56] them you say Well they're covered but
[1:25:58] when God wants to deal with them he
[1:26:00] takes the covering off and he digs and
[1:26:04] works on him and then he covers them
[1:26:07] again
[1:26:08] and so he tells you that a lot of things
[1:26:11] in life he covers up like uh they did
[1:26:15] too was it Moses had recognized that
[1:26:17] great when it got
[1:26:19] and he hit him in the leg because he
[1:26:21] liked him
[1:26:23] who
[1:26:24] Michelangelo
[1:26:27] and the thing of it was is that that
[1:26:29] we're talking about a theologian
[1:26:33] because he covers that gospel
[1:26:35] and what we want is the gospel that
[1:26:39] lives
[1:26:40] and you say well if the Theologian said
[1:26:43] it
[1:26:44] if your denominations say it then you
[1:26:48] got problems
[1:26:49] but we want that we want God because the
[1:26:53] Theologian cannot walk up and take the
[1:26:56] word of God and start using it all he
[1:26:59] can do is he has to stay with the word
[1:27:01] the way he understands it
[1:27:04] but you get somebody alive with the
[1:27:07] power of the Resurrection
[1:27:09] amen that knows that God is alive then
[1:27:12] the thing of it is you begin to tell
[1:27:15] these people what it is this is the
[1:27:17] fullness this is the godhead this is
[1:27:19] God's dealing and think of the life that
[1:27:22] we would have once become acquainted
[1:27:25] with the life of almighty God
[1:27:28] but the Theologian never can change
[1:27:33] you say well I believe that well a year
[1:27:35] from now you'll listen to that
[1:27:37] Theologian and you'll believe him till
[1:27:39] you don't know what to do
[1:27:41] but it never changes it's where
[1:27:44] Melchizedek is where God it's the
[1:27:47] fullness of the godhead is what brings
[1:27:49] it alive
[1:27:50] and the thing of it is is that as we
[1:27:53] look at life and we look at the
[1:27:55] penalties of life in there who is this
[1:27:58] Melchizedek
[1:28:01] it can change those words take that
[1:28:03] covering off that carving
[1:28:06] and show you that have eternal life
[1:28:11] big word
[1:28:15] eternal life
[1:28:17] to me that's a awful big word
[1:28:20] and God knows you as a
[1:28:23] eternal life individual
[1:28:26] and he knows that only word can hear God
[1:28:29] is a prophet
[1:28:32] and he's the one that quotes the word of
[1:28:35] God to URI
[1:28:38] the word of God did you read it you say
[1:28:40] that's nothing but God talking to me
[1:28:44] and he's telling me very important
[1:28:47] issues
[1:28:49] I think sometimes brothers and sisters I
[1:28:53] think we're
[1:28:54] talking about things that
[1:28:59] can I get over just talking about our
[1:29:01] wives
[1:29:03] and she wants to talk about the husband
[1:29:06] but the thing of it is how many of you
[1:29:08] want to walk a little deeper
[1:29:11] how many of you want to see Christ alive
[1:29:14] in their life
[1:29:16] that's what I'm talking about
[1:29:19] and I think if we're not careful we try
[1:29:21] to build certain things
[1:29:24] because you don't know who it is that
[1:29:26] you know
[1:29:28] we're still messing with parts and
[1:29:31] little old things when you're talking to
[1:29:34] an eternal God
[1:29:36] Because He Lives it ought to change our
[1:29:39] lives
[1:29:40] I think it ought to cost something in
[1:29:42] our heart in life I think that when we
[1:29:44] leave out of here I think sometimes
[1:29:46] people don't pray
[1:29:48] how many of you pray when you leave and
[1:29:50] ask God to change your life
[1:29:53] then it's necessary isn't it and you
[1:29:56] expect it but if you go and and you
[1:29:58] don't do that you go out about business
[1:30:00] and nothing is done about it
[1:30:03] and you say Michael you're just being
[1:30:05] cruel I'm not being cruel
[1:30:07] I'm not a man that just
[1:30:12] don't practice the word of God I want
[1:30:14] life
[1:30:16] I want to see the power of God heal the
[1:30:18] sick I want to see him see that God
[1:30:21] Lives tonight that they know themselves
[1:30:24] he lives
[1:30:27] and I'll tell you something else if you
[1:30:29] start out 50 years ago and I have longer
[1:30:32] than that I guess
[1:30:34] I know him better today than I did then
[1:30:39] and you ought to know him better
[1:30:43] and the thing of it is is that then when
[1:30:45] you begin to meet him you just turn
[1:30:47] around and kneel down here one of these
[1:30:49] seats and raise them hands to God
[1:30:52] who are you anyway
[1:30:55] ladies man
[1:31:00] God I need help
[1:31:03] God I am yours you know that you're my
[1:31:06] father
[1:31:08] you're my Holy Spirit
[1:31:11] but the time you go many times and don't
[1:31:14] pay no attention to what God's doing
[1:31:16] you'll walk and forget about the need
[1:31:18] that you have in your body
[1:31:21] and they only want to quotes to it is
[1:31:23] that theophany
[1:31:25] or that church that your people go to
[1:31:27] rather than one that God has imagine
[1:31:31] living at a church today
[1:31:33] that is preaching the Living Word of God
[1:31:39] that you know it is the word of God
[1:31:43] and you know it is the promise of God
[1:31:47] not a system that's holding it having to
[1:31:50] repeat it and I'm telling you because he
[1:31:52] lives I'm telling that's fresh today
[1:31:56] and because he said that that seed will
[1:31:58] be different than the shuck
[1:32:00] you ought to start hollering thank you
[1:32:03] and when you start seeing God rewarding
[1:32:05] your life
[1:32:07] ought to be nothing
[1:32:09] it changes our life
[1:32:11] we ought to go to crying out to God
[1:32:15] how do you stay warm without it
[1:32:17] how do you stay alive with God if God
[1:32:20] don't live in you
[1:32:22] ladies huh
[1:32:25] you're worried about your hubby
[1:32:27] friends you got a bigger problem than
[1:32:28] that one
[1:32:30] man what's your problem
[1:32:32] you got a bigger problem than she is you
[1:32:36] got a bigger problem than the job you
[1:32:38] got a bigger problem anywhere

[1:33:20] said Sarah you have the baby that's
[1:33:23] going to live

[1:33:27] take care of the other woman but I'm
[1:33:29] going to guarantee you we're going to
[1:33:30] have to do something with that maybe
[1:33:35] ah it's not true
[1:33:38] amen I have seen about a hundred years
[1:33:40] old and she has that baby and then
[1:33:43] here's Abraham now he's got a real
[1:33:46] living child the seed now makes the
[1:33:49] boast as for him that lives I know him

[1:34:05] worry about it okay Daddy didn't bother
[1:34:08] him any
[1:34:09] even because he was part of his daddy
[1:34:11] daddy got up there and said son he said
[1:34:14] we got the thing all built got the wood
[1:34:17] all out gonna go out here what you're
[1:34:18] gonna do he said I want you up here
[1:34:20] laying on here
[1:34:22] did he oppose it oh he got up there he
[1:34:25] said there's no lamb here so and God
[1:34:28] raised that knife with it as I said
[1:34:30] where it drove it but
[1:34:32] God showed up
[1:34:34] God said don't do that that's fine
[1:34:36] and I just tell you tonight brothers and
[1:34:39] sisters honestly
[1:34:41] he's coming
[1:34:45] how many of you think you might need to
[1:34:48] know him better
[1:34:49] if he could come
[1:34:52] huh how many of you believe in the
[1:34:56] voice of God are able to create
[1:35:00] a message
[1:35:01] incidentally I read a
[1:35:04] page or two of a book you give me the
[1:35:06] other day brother your wife
[1:35:09] and I said that man saw a pillar of Fire
[1:35:13] and he fell in love with that Pillar of
[1:35:15] Fire
[1:35:17] and I say to you today that God that
[1:35:19] lives brothers and sisters ought to be
[1:35:22] alive and you're in my heart and life
[1:35:24] and I say that if it is may God bless
[1:35:28] you
[1:35:29] amen I just believe that when you run
[1:35:33] into a difficulty who is this
[1:35:35] Melchizedek
[1:35:36] he'll take care of it
[1:35:38] you say brother Mike I don't have nobody
[1:35:40] he'll take care of it
[1:35:42] amen and I think if I was you and you
[1:35:45] were me
[1:35:47] I just turned around I deal myself at
[1:35:49] that place I'd raised my hand say God
[1:35:52] a lot of things don't matter I need them
[1:35:54] to matter
[1:35:55] I need a conversation I need a devotion
[1:35:58] Lord
[1:36:00] I'm more interested in the TV than you
[1:36:06] may God help us
[1:36:08] may God bless this message to you
[1:36:11] because I'm telling you
[1:36:13] you'll hear something but it won't be
[1:36:16] his word
[1:36:18] I said God please don't let me hear
[1:36:20] something like that
[1:36:22] amen because that Theologian will tell
[1:36:25] you just the way God told you earlier
[1:36:28] but God through is that right if you
[1:36:31] want to read it you can read it you know
[1:36:33] what God does to a word like that that's
[1:36:35] laid out
[1:36:37] the Bible says to you or I what he does
[1:36:39] is he says attributes
[1:36:44] he said and then I will send attributes
[1:36:47] to that word
[1:36:49] I said you got to be kidding me
[1:36:53] imagine the word you say there's nothing
[1:36:55] here no hope and all of a sudden God
[1:36:57] comes by with an attribute
[1:37:00] I'll never leave you nor forsake you
[1:37:04] amen you got that squirrel
[1:37:06] you got that answer I'll tell you what
[1:37:09] it is there it is there it is there it
[1:37:10] is that's who we serve
[1:37:12] and if you don't believe that's in there
[1:37:14] about them aptitudes attitudes
[1:37:17] God said these God out there they
[1:37:19] believe certain things but he said I'll
[1:37:21] put New Attitudes in it
[1:37:24] how many of you believe the word of God
[1:37:26] has got New Attitudes in it that when
[1:37:28] you first start reading it
[1:37:31] how many of you believe that he lives
[1:37:33] today more than he ever lived before if
[1:37:35] we could say that
[1:37:37] and what we're talking about is real
[1:37:40] because what he did the unbeliever will
[1:37:43] never believe
[1:37:44] but I'll put something in it that will
[1:37:46] make that word of God become a greater
[1:37:48] presence to you than you've ever read it
[1:37:51] before in your life
[1:37:53] may God bless you would you stand with
[1:37:55] me this morning or today I'm sorry
[1:38:01] our heavenly father as we
[1:38:04] stand in the presence and realize
[1:38:08] the devotion Lord that you showed people
[1:38:12] you took to church put 2 000 people a
[1:38:15] thousand people in each side of this
[1:38:18] I've been there Lord and he stood there
[1:38:20] and he couldn't look to pulp it out and
[1:38:22] see him he put it right towards the wall
[1:38:25] and preached those messages to those
[1:38:28] people that were sitting there
[1:38:31] the message that we repeated tonight
[1:38:33] Lord we're repeating today
[1:38:36] about those
[1:38:37] questions and those answers and I say
[1:38:40] God please don't let me be made with a
[1:38:43] shuck
[1:38:44] let me be different
[1:38:46] please let me understand Lord Who You
[1:38:49] Are Who We Are
[1:38:52] and may it be here in this building Lord
[1:38:54] may we understand what your doing for
[1:38:57] hearts and lives
[1:38:59] bless his father
[1:39:01] we ask it
[1:39:05] whoever they are Lord may you touch
[1:39:07] their heart
[1:39:09] may they not believe a theologian
[1:39:12] nor theophany
[1:39:14] Lord but may they hear their
[1:39:16] ever-present word of God
[1:39:19] and it's life
[1:39:21] we ask it Lord of you in Jesus name amen
[1:39:28] can I tell you something in closing
[1:39:32] brother Bram told those people
[1:39:36] he's facing this
[1:39:39] wall
[1:39:41] he says to a thousand people on his left
[1:39:44] he said I can't see who you are
[1:39:47] he said but if you're sick
[1:39:50] [Music]
[1:39:53] call on God
[1:39:55] you might say what does it make friends
[1:39:58] it's what brings God to appearance
[1:40:03] make a call
[1:40:06] and he said there's a lady there now
[1:40:08] who's got cancer
[1:40:10] I don't know about you
[1:40:13] but he told her
[1:40:16] and God healed him
[1:40:17] [Music]
[1:40:19] and you say well I don't know about that
[1:40:21] well
[1:40:24] there was one there that he told him
[1:40:27] about marriage and divorce and he said I
[1:40:29] told him
[1:40:30] go ahead and live like you're living
[1:40:33] God answered something touched brother
[1:40:36] Branham to tell that man
[1:40:38] some Roy Roberson how many of you heard
[1:40:40] Roy Roberson and what a friend he is of
[1:40:43] brother Branham and he made that
[1:40:45] statement
[1:40:47] he took such a part in that man's cry
[1:40:52] well think about this people here
[1:40:55] thinking out about me
[1:40:57] and are you praying for me to help me is
[1:40:59] going to help me
[1:41:03] and then all of a sudden he changed it
[1:41:07] he said there's another lady laying over
[1:41:09] on the right on that cot
[1:41:13] and said she can't get around she's got
[1:41:15] cancer bad
[1:41:16] [Music]
[1:41:19] imagine that
[1:41:21] he said she's got cancer
[1:41:25] all I can say is he's talking to God
[1:41:30] it's like you
[1:41:31] you telling me that God's not hearing me
[1:41:34] talk
[1:41:37] you hear that you you don't think that
[1:41:39] God pays any attention to what I'm
[1:41:42] saying
[1:41:44] [Music]
[1:41:47] and he said lady
[1:41:50] Jesus Christ makes you well
[1:41:55] she gets up out of that cot
[1:41:58] he couldn't get close to touch her
[1:42:01] but by a thought laid upon his heart he
[1:42:05] spoke it
[1:42:07] then I say to you how many of you
[1:42:09] tonight
[1:42:10] have a request on your heart
[1:42:14] and by the grace of God I will remember
[1:42:18] those questions

[1:43:23] things

[1:43:34] and I believe he knows who's going to be
[1:43:37] there
