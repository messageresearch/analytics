[18:21] They're visiting Brother Warren and his
[18:23] family. We ask him to bless us today.
[18:25] Greet the people and pray over our needs
[18:26] today.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we just Well, I'm I'm a
[18:30] pastor from Florida, like he said, and
[18:32] drove all the way out here. We drove out
[18:34] here, wanted to take a little road trip,
[18:36] give my wife some of her bucket list.
[18:39] And uh and so visiting Brother Warren
[18:42] for his 50th birthday is so valuable to
[18:46] a friend, a colleague in this message to
[18:48] me. And so it's a privilege to be be
[18:51] with you this morning. Uh let's just
[18:53] let's just I want you to remember
[18:55] something. You know, as we as we
[18:57] approached the Lord with our needs, I
[19:00] want you to remember the prophet is the
[19:01] only one that taught us the reason there
[19:03] was a fall was because God wanted to
[19:06] reveal his attributes.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; And so people even bride people become
[19:12] sick so that God can glorify himself.
[19:15] Yeah.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; And so the thing that you go through is
[19:18] not for yourself, it's so that God can
[19:21] be glorified in you.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; And so the prophet said like for
[19:24] healing, if there's if there's not a
[19:26] reason if God doesn't show you why he
[19:29] won't heal you, then we claim it.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; We claim what he's already done. He
[19:34] can't if he was standing here in the
[19:35] flesh right now, he couldn't heal you
[19:37] because he's already done it. And so we
[19:39] just need the faith to grab hold of what
[19:42] he's already done. So let's bow our
[19:44] hearts. Our heavenly father,
[19:46] &gt;&gt; as we have come this morning as as a a
[19:49] portion of your bride, Lord, in this end
[19:51] time, Father, with a a claim on your
[19:54] word like no one like no one in any age
[19:58] before has, Father, as as the stargazers
[20:02] have expanded their understanding of the
[20:05] stars and the universe continues to get
[20:07] bigger, Father, that was your first word
[20:10] and Lord, this word that you have given
[20:12] us is also, Father, as we read it, as we
[20:15] look at it, as we sit under the the the
[20:18] canopy of this message of the hour,
[20:20] Father, these words are becoming more
[20:22] more valuable, more uh more consuming
[20:26] for us. And so, it's it it's it's in the
[20:30] knowledge of this word that we approach
[20:32] you this morning. And we thank you,
[20:33] Father, for what you're doing among us.
[20:36] We thank you that you have brought needs
[20:38] before this bride of Christ because
[20:40] these are needs that can be ministered
[20:42] through the branches of the tree of
[20:44] life. And we claim Lord the healing. We
[20:47] claim the deliverance. We claim the the
[20:50] peace. We claim the the comfort.

[30:51] know that there's people praying for
[30:53] you.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; You know, the text, the meals,
[30:58] &gt;&gt; how could we say thank you?
[31:00] &gt;&gt; So, we just want to sing a song. Maybe
[31:01] it's an encouragement.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[31:16] I'm crazy. We're going out to this
[31:19] battle.
[31:21] They say I'm defenseless against the
[31:23] enemy.
[31:27] This hand me down armor doesn't suit me.
[31:32] I've got the only weapon I need.
[31:37] Cuz a giant here before me doesn't see
[31:40] the God behind me. If he didn't, he'd be
[31:43] on his knees. I come in the name of the
[31:48] one who is gater. Nobody can run his
[31:53] name into the ground. Cuz a rock that I
[31:57] got is a mighty savior.
[32:02] And before I swing that snow le,
[32:07] [Music]
[32:14] [Applause]
[32:15] [Music]
[32:23] but I wasn't giving.
[32:26] The lines were drawn on a hill called
[32:29] Calvary.
[32:31] The heaven sent the rock of ages to
[32:34] fight it over me.
[32:37] And death went down forever in defeat.
[32:41] There's no weapon formed against me.
[32:44] Stronger than the God is with me. The
[32:47] cornerstone is my victory.
[32:50] I call the name of the one who is gater.
[32:55] Nobody can run his name into the ground.
[33:00] Cuz the rock that I got is a mighty
[33:04] savior.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; And before I swing that stone
[33:11] around,
[33:14] oh, I know my coming down.
[33:22] The fear that rocks me is coming down.
[33:27] The down that shakes me is coming down.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; They're coming down. The gates of hell
[33:37] cannot prevail cuz they're coming down.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; They're coming down.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, I come in the name of the one who is
[33:48] gater. Nobody can ride his name into the
[33:52] ground. Cuz the rock that I got is a
[33:56] mighty savior.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; And before I see that moment turn
[34:04] around.
[34:07] Oh kind of light is coming down.
[34:15] Fear that robs me is coming down.
[34:20] The doubt that shakes me is coming down.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Bitterness and envy.
[34:27] They're coming down. The gates of hell
[34:30] cannot prevail cuz they're coming down.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; They're coming down.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Why come in the name of the one who is
[34:40] gater? Nobody can run. His name is in
[34:45] the ground. There's a rock that I've got
[34:49] is a mighty savior.
[34:52] And before I swing last
[34:58] round,
[35:00] oh, I know my lion's coming down.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, he's coming down.
[35:11] He's coming down.
[35:14] [Music]
[35:20] Amen. Amen.

[48:30] &gt;&gt; And I want to thank you for all uh for
[48:33] remembering us in prayer where we in the
[48:36] Philippines
[48:37] and we know that the prayer of the
[48:39] saints as the prophet said are million
[48:42] times stronger than angels. So we were
[48:45] kept by your prayer because when we
[48:47] arrived in the Philippines there was a
[48:49] lot of earthquakes multiple places
[48:53] and we are just kept by the grace of
[48:56] God. Amen.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; So before uh we go to the mission report
[49:01] I would like to read a portion of
[49:04] scripture which can be found in Matthew
[49:07] chapter 24 verse 47 and 48 and 49.
[49:14] and that repentance and remission of
[49:16] sins should be preached in his name
[49:19] among all nations beginning at
[49:21] Jerusalem.
[49:23] And ye are witnesses of these things. We
[49:26] are witnesses.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Not only ministers, but even uh as a
[49:32] member of body of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; And behold, I send the promise of the
[49:37] father upon you, but carry in the city
[49:39] of Jerusalem until you be endued with
[49:42] power from on high. And as the the
[49:45] prophet said, you have no right to
[49:47] preach the gospel unless you meet Jesus
[49:49] Christ personally. So the commission
[49:51] until you are endued with power and I
[49:54] believe we are now endued with power on
[49:56] high. Amen. So we are our life is a
[49:59] testimony and we become the witness that
[50:03] uh our God is a living God. Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; So can we pull out the map of the
[50:09] Philippines brother? The Philippines.
[50:11] Another one.
[50:12] So,
[50:14] so that's uh Philippines is uh located
[50:16] in the south southeast uh Asia
[50:20] and it's composed of 7,67
[50:25] uh 41 islands and almost 2,000 island
[50:30] are inhabited. So it's a big island
[50:34] composed of 116 million people.
[50:38] So it's comprised of three big island.
[50:41] the Luzon which is the northern Visayas
[50:44] in Bindanao. So we were located when we
[50:47] arrived uh we left uh August 8th and
[50:51] arrived in October the 10th at around
[50:55] 12:30 p a.m. So
[50:59] uh we were picked up by brother Danny
[51:01] Dil Mundo and put us in a hotel. So we
[51:04] have a good rest in that Friday. So just
[51:10] to refresh ourselves and relax for
[51:12] ourselves. So brother Ron is so sick at
[51:14] during that time when we travel and he
[51:17] said that if I cannot make it I will
[51:19] send you but in my heart I know that I
[51:22] can go but I am not the right person for
[51:24] that occasion. We always need to know
[51:27] our position. So we've been praying for
[51:29] that and I I can go but I am not the
[51:33] right person to do that occasion because
[51:35] it's a ministerial banquet
[51:38] uh uh meetings. So it's important that
[51:42] an elder from from the message of the
[51:45] hour is uh very important. So we arrived
[51:48] and there was multitude of earthquake in
[51:50] the part of Bisayas. There we can see in
[51:54] the central Bisayas and the northern
[51:56] part of Luzon and the Mindanao area
[51:58] there was multiple earthquakes. One is
[52:01] uh 6.4 the other one is 4.9 the other
[52:05] one is 5.6 and there was always a lot of
[52:08] floods and typhoons but by God's grace
[52:11] as I said it was by the power of your
[52:13] prayer
[52:14] &gt;&gt; that keep us during our stay there. So,
[52:19] so we
[52:21] uh Friday we arrive and Saturday uh
[52:24] brother Danny Deluno pick us up to have
[52:27] a lunch and uh after the lunch we have
[52:30] an casual fellowship with some of the
[52:33] ministers that arrived earlier for the
[52:36] occasion. So we have uh this agenda of
[52:39] question and answers about the message
[52:41] of the hour and uh it was really a
[52:45] blessings. So Sunday morning
[52:49] uh start of the service. So we have
[52:51] services Sunday morning, Sunday evening
[52:55] is a banquet then Monday morning. So
[52:57] when brother Ron stand out he opened
[53:00] with a word that he says I didn't come
[53:03] to bring you revelation or teachings or
[53:05] doctrines but I but uh to put you in
[53:08] remebrance to put you in remembrance of
[53:10] the things that you have already
[53:11] &gt;&gt; amen
[53:12] &gt;&gt; heard so it makes a a calm spirit among
[53:15] the ministers
[53:17] and he opened in the book of Exodus chap
[53:20] 23 verse 20 and he said behold I sent an
[53:25] angel before thee to keep thee in a way
[53:28] and to bring thee into the place which I
[53:30] have prepared.
[53:32] Beware of him and obey his voice,
[53:34] provoke him not, for he will not pardon
[53:36] your progressions, for my name is in
[53:39] him. But if thou shalt indeed obey his
[53:42] voice and do all that I speak, then I
[53:44] will be an enemy unto thine enemies, an
[53:46] adversary unto thine adversary. And he
[53:50] titled the sermon, keep by the power of
[53:52] God unto your destination. So it was a
[53:56] powerful service and everybody enjoy the
[53:59] presence of the Lord and I feel the
[54:02] spirit of God moving and I forgot to
[54:04] take photo of the event. So I we are
[54:09] focusing on the sermon.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; And brother Ron don't need really
[54:13] interpreter because his English is so
[54:15] clear that even the little boy after the
[54:18] service said that that's the kind of
[54:21] preaching that I want. So it was a
[54:24] blessing. things that after the service
[54:26] everybody is still enjoying the the the
[54:29] word that we heard even little boys and
[54:32] they're enjoying it. So after the
[54:34] service we have a lunch again and break
[54:37] time. After that we go to our hotel to
[54:39] have refresh relax and prepare for the
[54:41] banquet that evening. So if you have uh
[54:44] some picture brother that you can
[54:47] uh pull up the ministers
[54:52] I don't know if the I don't uh yeah so
[54:54] that's the only photo I got that's uh
[54:58] almost the ministers that attended the
[55:00] service this morning. So another slide.
[55:05] So brother Ron is preaching. Maybe
[55:07] there's another one.
[55:10] So that's the church of uh brother Danny
[55:13] Del Mundo.
[55:15] So while brother Ron is uh preaching
[55:19] introducing himself
[55:22] uh do you have uh the the video one of
[55:28] our Jesus Christ.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm happy to be here in the
[55:35] Philippines once again
[55:37] &gt;&gt; and to be with you knowing that God that
[55:39] children all over the world,
[55:44] &gt;&gt; different color skin,
[55:47] &gt;&gt; speak a different language,
[55:49] &gt;&gt; but we have the same father.
[55:52] [Music]
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm happy to have my wife and
[55:57] sister Sandy to be here with me.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; I saw a miracle today.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; You had my wife come up and see
[56:10] Next uh video, the miracle that brother
[56:14] Ron says.
[56:19] [Music]
[56:28] [Applause]
[56:30] [Music]
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think that's enough
[56:38] brothers. So that's a real miracle
[56:43] cuz brother that's the first time that
[56:44] happened in his entire ministry. So
[56:48] praise the lord. So this is the fourth
[56:50] time that I am brother Ron traveled to
[56:52] the Philippines and second time for
[56:53] sister Sunday. So it's really a blessing
[56:56] and it's an honor to be with brother Ron
[56:59] in this trip. I really enjoy them. They
[57:02] are so much fun to be with. So
[57:05] I'm see to it that he is uh okay. So we
[57:09] bombarded them with the vitamin C. So
[57:13] they recover easily. So I always stand
[57:16] at his back make sure that he's okay.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So so the next uh after the
[57:24] service that morning so we went to the
[57:27] hotel and relax and refresh ourselves
[57:29] for the banquet. So if you have the
[57:32] uh pictures of the banquet uh vers so
[57:35] that's brother Ron uh the title of uh
[57:41] the theme of the banquet is 20 years and
[57:46] beyond. So 2025 and beyond it gives
[57:50] tributes to the pioneer of the message
[57:52] in that area because the area in where
[57:55] brother Danny lives is formerly a leaper
[57:58] colony and it was dreaded by neighboring
[58:02] towns but there was two brother who was
[58:05] converted to the message of the hour and
[58:07] they were the one who pioneered that
[58:09] area and God's blessed that area right
[58:12] now. So, uh, brother Danny gave tributes
[58:16] to the wives of those two ministers
[58:20] and, uh, it was quite, uh, it was, uh,
[58:25] quite, uh, very successful event because
[58:29] they planned, uh, a year a one almost
[58:32] one year that they planned it. So as
[58:35] brother Branham said that uh it's nice
[58:38] to have a friend and meet new friend but
[58:41] there's nothing like old friends.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; So it was a beauty to behold the unity
[58:46] of the brothers and sisters and it
[58:48] breaks the wall of misunderstanding. It
[58:50] breaks the wall of dysfellowship
[58:53] &gt;&gt; and uh long friends become friends
[58:56] again.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; So usually it's almost the same spirit.
[59:00] So sometimes uh there's a
[59:02] misunderstanding, miscommunications,
[59:05] somebody thinks something like that and
[59:07] it separate the fellowship. But this
[59:10] event is very uh uh memorable one
[59:13] because everybody see each other and
[59:15] they forgot all the differences. They
[59:17] just hug one another
[59:19] &gt;&gt; and uh reminisce the the time that they
[59:22] were uh they they receive and all of
[59:26] that. So it's very memorable that the
[59:28] presence of brother Ron is very special.
[59:31] So he's like a father mentoring to his
[59:34] children especially when he shared about
[59:36] his life testimony meeting with uh Billy
[59:39] Paul and brother
[59:42] uh Joseph because it's really
[59:44] significant because there's always a lot
[59:46] of followers of Joseph. So when brother
[59:48] Ron share about his testimony about
[59:51] Billy Paul and and uh brother Joseph
[59:55] there it seems like there is a man who
[59:57] knows personally brother Joseph but this
[59:59] was not very boastful about himself. Oh
[1:00:02] I know this I know that he's just humble
[1:00:04] person he make it common. So it's just a
[1:00:07] special things for the believers
[1:00:10] in the Philippines. So after the
[1:00:14] after the banquet Sunday evening so the
[1:00:16] following day Monday so if you have uh
[1:00:18] the slide brother for the ministers
[1:00:20] meeting
[1:00:22] so there was uh so some of the ministers
[1:00:26] so the the attendee of the banquetss
[1:00:29] almost 250
[1:00:32] uh ministers and their wives. So the
[1:00:34] next slide uh so by the way it's still
[1:00:38] going. So that's brother Ray Soraniano
[1:00:40] the if you remember brother Aser Gab
[1:00:43] Gabriel that's his pastor in the
[1:00:45] Philippines.
[1:00:47] So if there's other slide so just you
[1:00:49] can go. So this is uh Monday morning uh
[1:00:52] there is a wives minister's meeting. So
[1:00:57] sister stand shar something in there and
[1:01:00] uh we have the also the minister's
[1:01:02] meeting at the church. So, brother Ron
[1:01:05] is uh sharing the gospel and there was
[1:01:08] question and answer and the agenda for
[1:01:11] the question and answer is guess what
[1:01:15] what is the difference between the Holy
[1:01:17] Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost and new
[1:01:19] birth. So before we went to the
[1:01:23] Philippines that the subject that is
[1:01:24] brother Ron is also preaching in our
[1:01:26] church. So God is so on time. Amen.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; So that's the minister that attended
[1:01:32] almost 50 ministers. So it was really a
[1:01:36] blessing that some of their question
[1:01:38] were answered and they requested a copy
[1:01:42] of all uh brother one is uh uh sharing
[1:01:46] to them. So
[1:01:51] after the minister's meeting then uh
[1:01:55] Tuesday
[1:01:56] uh we flew to
[1:01:58] uh Shangmai.
[1:02:00] So so that's the Philippines. Shang uh
[1:02:03] Thailand is west of the Philippines.
[1:02:07] So that's we're in Thailand.
[1:02:10] So we uh there's only one direct flight
[1:02:13] from Manila to Shiang.
[1:02:17] And I told brother Ron if you there's
[1:02:19] only one uh way one flight direct but
[1:02:22] the time is 900 pm and we will arrive at
[1:02:26] 1:00 a.m. So if you want to
[1:02:30] go to Shiang in the early hours we need
[1:02:35] to fly from Manila, Bangkok and
[1:02:39] Thailand. So it's double flight. So he
[1:02:44] said that I don't mind flying 9 and
[1:02:46] arriving at 1:00. So he's okay. So I
[1:02:49] booked the ticket and I called my
[1:02:52] Filipino friend who's now residing in
[1:02:54] Bangkok to prepare a taxi for us when we
[1:02:57] arrive at around 1:00 a.m. So do you
[1:03:00] have a picture, brothers? Uh the taxi
[1:03:03] driver that uh
[1:03:05] pick us up at the airport.
[1:03:09] So
[1:03:11] my friend already arranged for a taxi to
[1:03:13] pick us up. So when we arrive at 1:00
[1:03:16] a.m. we meet that brother or not
[1:03:19] brother. We met the taxi driver and he
[1:03:22] made our day
[1:03:24] because oh that's me. That's that's my
[1:03:26] name. What is your name? Say what? Yes.
[1:03:29] What is your name? My name is what? Yeah
[1:03:32] that's what I'm asking. What is your
[1:03:34] name? What is my name? That's why I'm
[1:03:37] asking you what is your name? My name is
[1:03:40] Mario and what is your name? My name is
[1:03:42] what? Yeah. What is your name?
[1:03:46] In other words, what means temple? Oh, I
[1:03:48] got it. So, he made our day and made us
[1:03:52] a good lap early in the morning. So, we
[1:03:55] went directly to the hotel and have a
[1:03:57] rest.
[1:03:59] And uh since the meeting will be in the
[1:04:02] evening, so we explore the land, spying
[1:04:05] the land. So we're just enjoying the
[1:04:08] tropical fruit, the coconut. And she's
[1:04:11] just standing enjoying the
[1:04:14] second round of coconut juice.
[1:04:18] And so we explored the the area
[1:04:21] and
[1:04:25] uh we meet uh uh brother
[1:04:29] which brother Rondown introduced to
[1:04:32] brother Mark. Uh by the way brother
[1:04:35] Rondon's parent are here sister Judith
[1:04:37] brother Steve God bless you. So
[1:04:45] their son meet uh can uh Thai Taiwan uh
[1:04:50] Thailanders and brother Rondon
[1:04:53] introduced cyan to brother Malcolm. So
[1:04:56] when brother Malcolm knew about our
[1:04:59] travel to Thailand he gave the contact
[1:05:02] number to brother Ron. So when we
[1:05:05] arrive, brother can say meet us and if
[1:05:08] do you have some pictures there brother
[1:05:10] can you just pull it up. So I thought uh
[1:05:14] before we go there I thought that it is
[1:05:17] only a house meeting
[1:05:20] but uh it was really a church that he
[1:05:23] bring us to and I realized that uh
[1:05:27] Thailand is an open country for
[1:05:29] Christian. So actually there are five
[1:05:32] major
[1:05:34] religion in Thailand. Buddhist, Muslim,
[1:05:37] the Hindu, uh the shik and the
[1:05:41] Christian. So I thought that they are
[1:05:43] pure Buddhist. But uh I just know that
[1:05:47] there was a Christian. In fact in Shiang
[1:05:48] Mai there was a huge uh Christian
[1:05:51] school, a Bible school in that area. So
[1:05:54] that is brother Zion. And as we begin to
[1:05:59] have fellowship, I asked about him about
[1:06:01] the books. So we just be very careful
[1:06:05] what we meet. So I asked him about the
[1:06:07] books if you have. So he said we don't
[1:06:10] have books. Have you heard the message
[1:06:12] of Dawa? So he said that he's just
[1:06:15] listening to YouTube about brother Bham
[1:06:18] occasionally.
[1:06:20] So we're concluded that they are just
[1:06:23] new to the message of the hour. They
[1:06:25] don't know anything about really deep
[1:06:28] into the message but he entertain us. He
[1:06:32] prepare a dinner and you know that uh uh
[1:06:35] when I travel
[1:06:38] uh abroad I always brought my wife with
[1:06:40] me because he can easily
[1:06:44] uh join or mix can easily uh
[1:06:50] get in to to some of the sisters there.
[1:06:54] So while we are fellowshipping we know
[1:06:56] that uh brother was always on fire to
[1:07:00] share the gospel in the message. In fact
[1:07:03] uh the one who attended that uh evening
[1:07:06] mostly are new converts to Christianity.
[1:07:10] uh they are from Buddhist and converted
[1:07:13] to Christianity just three months some
[1:07:15] four months and the other one brother
[1:07:18] Pisit he was uh he was on fire to share
[1:07:23] the message or the gospel of Jesus
[1:07:26] Christ to his villages but he has no
[1:07:29] Bible school background so that's why
[1:07:31] but he was always on fire so all of them
[1:07:34] so during the night after the dinner
[1:07:36] they prepared us a dinner uh Thailand uh
[1:07:39] uh delicacies they have crocodile curry.
[1:07:42] So we tried crocodile curry. Sister
[1:07:46] Sandy tried crocodile curry. So brother
[1:07:48] Ron always a chili
[1:07:51] uh one bowl of chili always prepared for
[1:07:54] him. So we enjoyed their hospitality. So
[1:07:58] after after the dinner we have a song uh
[1:08:03] worship. Then after that we have uh
[1:08:06] testimonies. So brother Juan gave the
[1:08:08] testimony and share my testimony. I know
[1:08:10] that when I asked him what is your
[1:08:13] background Christianity? So he said that
[1:08:14] evangelical. So are you are you uh what
[1:08:18] is your organization? Are you
[1:08:20] independent or are there you have a
[1:08:23] mother church? So he said that uh they
[1:08:25] have a mother church but they operate
[1:08:28] independently.
[1:08:30] So I know that the evangelical are
[1:08:33] trinitarian. So I start to gave
[1:08:36] testimonies about my conversion in in
[1:08:40] the message of the hour. So I bring it
[1:08:42] very subtly and about the baptism in the
[1:08:47] name of Jesus Christ. Father, son, holy
[1:08:49] ghost is not a name but that's a title
[1:08:52] of the name. So so after the testimonies
[1:08:56] uh we have a prayer meeting. So brother
[1:09:00] Pit so that's why he asked for prayer.
[1:09:03] He has this uh in his side he is aching
[1:09:06] for some times and we prayed and after
[1:09:09] we prayed I mean the next slide so he's
[1:09:12] moving his uh
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; he feel healings after the after the
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; so he's rejoicing and uh so everybody
[1:09:21] after that go one by one everybody have
[1:09:25] a prayer meeting during time so we have
[1:09:27] we enjoy the fellowship we enjoy the the
[1:09:30] meetings and uh we has uh uh bring the
[1:09:35] message very wisely to them
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; so that they will not be choked.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; So
[1:09:42] after the meeting, so the following
[1:09:44] night they invited us again for dinner
[1:09:47] because they have question about the
[1:09:49] water baptism in Jesus name. So brother
[1:09:51] Ron did the followup of that uh Friday.
[1:09:55] Then uh uh after that uh uh the next
[1:10:01] library. So,
[1:10:05] so that's not the one the the last day
[1:10:08] in Shangmai.
[1:10:11] So, after the meeting, the last day in
[1:10:12] Shangmay. So, we have nothing to do. So,
[1:10:14] we just explore the the area, see the
[1:10:18] So, sometimes we don't really explore
[1:10:20] all the city because if you see a
[1:10:23] temple, it's just all the same because
[1:10:26] in every corner there's temple. Every
[1:10:28] corner there is a temple. So, we just
[1:10:30] explore. We rented a called it they
[1:10:34] called it talk. So we rented it for one
[1:10:37] hour to room around the city see what's
[1:10:39] the city likes. So that's our last day.
[1:10:42] So there's a crocodile barbecue that we
[1:10:44] enjoy
[1:10:46] and
[1:10:48] so we have a nice dinner beside the
[1:10:50] river because since it was our last day.
[1:10:53] So we have a good time. We're enjoying
[1:10:55] our time together there.
[1:10:57] Sandy and brother Ron and since there is
[1:11:01] no direct flight from Shiangme to the US
[1:11:05] so we need to take a flight from
[1:11:07] Shiangme to Bangkok. So we spent two
[1:11:10] days two nights in Bangkok then to the
[1:11:13] Philippines. So the last slide is when
[1:11:15] you see brother Ron and Battle. Uh the
[1:11:18] last slide please. So that's
[1:11:21] so that's uh another slide.
[1:11:28] So in our apartment there's always an
[1:11:31] image there look like Bettle. So every
[1:11:33] morning brother hi betel. Good night
[1:11:35] Betel.
[1:11:37] So when beta pick us up at the airport
[1:11:40] that's the slide of the show.
[1:11:43] So thank you very much. God bless you.
[1:11:53] Let's stand together. I speak the name
[1:11:55] of Jesus. Brother Robert, if you'll
[1:11:59] start us out with that song, please.

[1:12:43] Bring every stronghold
[1:12:46] shine through the shadow.
[1:12:49] [Music]
[1:12:57] Heavenly Father,
[1:13:00] as we come to you
[1:13:03] this morning, we bow ourselves in your
[1:13:06] presence.
[1:13:08] And we would ask heavenly father that
[1:13:10] you would come and grace us now with
[1:13:14] your presence as you walk among us.
[1:13:17] Speak to every heart.
[1:13:19] Open every eye.
[1:13:22] Lord, for we know your Bible is hidden
[1:13:24] from the wise and prudent, but it's
[1:13:27] revealed to babes such as would learn.
[1:13:30] So, Father, we are here this morning to
[1:13:33] sit at your feet
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; and ask you to come
[1:13:38] speak to us.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Let thy word, Father,
[1:13:43] may it become alive to us. May it become
[1:13:46] quickened because the letter kleth, but
[1:13:49] the spirit giveth life. Therefore,
[1:13:52] Father, may the author of that word
[1:13:55] come.
[1:13:57] May the Holy Spirit have preeminence
[1:13:59] this morning.
[1:14:01] Bless each and everyone we ask
[1:14:05] in the name of Jesus Christ and for his
[1:14:07] glory.
[1:14:09] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:12] Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you musicians.
[1:14:14] God bless you. Thank you brother Mario.
[1:14:17] There we went to the Philippines and to
[1:14:19] Thailand and uh it's always a blessing
[1:14:25] to be a witness for Jesus Christ in
[1:14:27] other places. And whenever you have a
[1:14:30] new work,
[1:14:32] you realize just like it is in the book
[1:14:34] of Acts. And many times what it is, God
[1:14:36] gives you an opportunity. You go there
[1:14:38] and then there's needs and you see needs
[1:14:40] among the people. You pray for them and
[1:14:42] God is doing signs and wonders. people
[1:14:45] are getting healed and everything like

[1:14:49] you.

[1:14:53] just see what the Lord would have for us
[1:14:55] in the future uh in going back over
[1:14:58] there. Uh amen. Let's just remain
[1:15:00] standing. Turn with me in your Bibles
[1:15:03] please to Revelation chapter 3. Very
[1:15:06] familiar portion of scripture. to each
[1:15:08] and every one of you this morning, all
[1:15:10] of our visitors and everyone. We greet
[1:15:12] you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:15:16] Amen. Revelation chapter 3
[1:15:20] verses 14-
[1:15:23] 22.
[1:15:26] And unto the angel of the church of the
[1:15:28] loudans,
[1:15:30] write
[1:15:32] these things, saith thee, amen, the
[1:15:34] faithful and true witness, the beginning
[1:15:38] of the creation of God. I know thy
[1:15:41] works, that thou art neither cold nor
[1:15:44] hot, I would thou art cold or hot. So
[1:15:48] then, because thou art lukewarm, and
[1:15:50] neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee
[1:15:54] out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I
[1:15:57] am rich and increased with goods, and
[1:16:00] ha, and have need of nothing, and
[1:16:02] knowest not that thou art wretched, and
[1:16:05] miserable, and poor, and blind, and
[1:16:09] naked. I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[1:16:13] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[1:16:15] rich in white raignment that thou mayest
[1:16:17] be clothed and that the shame of thy
[1:16:20] nakedness do not appear and to anoint
[1:16:22] thine eyes with Isab that thou mayest
[1:16:25] see. As many as I love I rebuke and
[1:16:29] chasen. Be zealous therefore and repent.
[1:16:32] Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[1:16:36] If any man hear my voice and open the
[1:16:38] door, I will come into him and will s
[1:16:42] with him and he with me. And to him that
[1:16:45] overcomemeth
[1:16:46] will I grant to sit with me in my
[1:16:49] throne. Even as I also overcame, and sat
[1:16:54] down with my father in his throne. He
[1:16:58] that hath an ear, let him hear what the
[1:17:01] spirit saith unto the churches. I want
[1:17:05] you to to notice verse 21 because it's
[1:17:08] there that I wish to place my emphasis
[1:17:13] because this this is to a very specific
[1:17:17] group of people.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; It's to those who overcome
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; that makes you an extra special
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; type of person. Hallelujah.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; To him
[1:17:34] that overcomes
[1:17:36] will I grant with me. Will I grant them
[1:17:38] to sit with me
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; talk about throne worthy
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; to he that overcomes.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Turn with me if you would to first John
[1:17:48] chapter 5
[1:17:51] verses 2-5.
[1:17:58] 1 John chapter 5
[1:18:01] verses 2-5.
[1:18:05] By this we know that we love the
[1:18:07] children of God when we love God and
[1:18:09] keep his commandments.
[1:18:12] For this is the love of God that we keep
[1:18:14] his commandments.
[1:18:16] And his commandments are not grievous.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; For whatsoever is born of God
[1:18:21] overcomemeth the world.
[1:18:25] And this is the victory that
[1:18:27] overcomemeth the world,
[1:18:29] even our faith.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Who is he that overcomemeth the world,
[1:18:35] but he that believeth that Jesus is the
[1:18:39] son of God.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word.
[1:18:42] You may be seated this morning in the
[1:18:44] presence of God.
[1:18:47] I want all of you to understand and take
[1:18:50] it very seriously
[1:18:52] that your destiny is to overcome not to
[1:18:55] undergo.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; You are not to be survivors of Laosa
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; but overcomers of it.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; That is your destiny and you must claim
[1:19:04] it and you must believe it.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; So I would like to title my sermon this
[1:19:12] morning he to he that overcomemeth.
[1:19:16] So I'm directing it to a very specific
[1:19:19] group of people
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; to he that overcomemeth and I take a
[1:19:25] subject this morning of overcoming the
[1:19:28] effects of louda
[1:19:30] not just surviving it.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:36] Now, I want to take this a little bit of
[1:19:39] a pastoral message
[1:19:42] because I'm feeling in my spirit
[1:19:45] to teach on this.
[1:19:47] So, it will be a help to all of you.
[1:19:51] I do not need to remind you that we are
[1:19:54] living in the worst of all ages.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; This is end time.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is where hell has
[1:20:04] the lid to hell has been lifted off.
[1:20:07] Demon spirits and all kinds of enticing,
[1:20:10] seducing spirits and deception which
[1:20:13] will deceive the whole world
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; of those whose names are not written in
[1:20:18] the lamb's book of life.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; So there's a great deception. There's a
[1:20:22] darkness over the country and over the
[1:20:25] world in itself. A gross darkness.
[1:20:30] And we know that the enemy is going
[1:20:32] around as a roaring lion seeking whom he
[1:20:34] may devour.
[1:20:36] And you and I have inherited a battle.
[1:20:40] It started in heaven, was cast down to
[1:20:42] earth.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; And brother Brennham said, "And it has
[1:20:45] become a warfare here down here on this
[1:20:50] earth
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; and we inherited it."
[1:20:54] So, but we've got to be aware of the
[1:20:56] what type of battle that we're in
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; because we don't want to be one that
[1:21:01] just beats the air. We want to know
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; what we're up against.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; We want to know the conditions that are
[1:21:09] going to affect us.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Because the God of this wicked world has
[1:21:15] created an Eden in which that he can
[1:21:18] perfect sin.
[1:21:23] We're living in the days when they will
[1:21:25] call evil good and good evil.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; We can see it in the social media around
[1:21:33] us, whether it be in televisions,
[1:21:35] newspapers, radio or whatever. It has
[1:21:38] permeated
[1:21:40] America. That's right.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; That word overcome is only used several
[1:21:49] times within the scriptures with the
[1:21:52] bulk of that usage found in the book of
[1:21:54] Revelation. And we find out that it's
[1:21:56] used among seven church ages.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; To he that overcomemeth will I grant.
[1:22:02] And in each age there is something that
[1:22:05] they must overcome.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; And only those who overcome that in
[1:22:09] their age will be granted the reward
[1:22:13] what he says will happen to them. And we
[1:22:16] just happen to be that seventh age that
[1:22:19] says, "I'll grant to you
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; the right to sit with me
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; on my throne."
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; You talk about a responsibility.
[1:22:28] I realize as a pastor in this age and as
[1:22:33] a minister of the gospel
[1:22:36] that weighs upon me heavily
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; because I realize that God is going to
[1:22:41] hold me responsible to tell you truth. I
[1:22:45] am not here to just preach to you
[1:22:48] something that make everybody feel good.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; I'm here to preach to you truth.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we realize that in every age
[1:23:00] there is a prevailing spirit that
[1:23:02] dominates the agemen.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; And like a shadow that hangs over a
[1:23:06] mountain
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; or like a coastal fog that enshrouds a
[1:23:11] coastline
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; so does this loudian spirit hover over
[1:23:16] everyone that is living in this age.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; We all know that the spirit is speaking
[1:23:23] now to a directed group of people. I
[1:23:27] want you to understand God's word is
[1:23:28] direct.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; It is focused
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; and it will produce what it is going to
[1:23:37] produce.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; It will not return void.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; we all know that the spirit is speaking
[1:23:48] then to every age and gives the details
[1:23:51] of what they are to overcome. And the
[1:23:53] prophet of God said, "It's not so much
[1:23:56] what you overcome, but how you
[1:23:58] overcome."
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; I want all of you to understand this,
[1:24:04] and that is you are meant to overcome
[1:24:06] this age.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to become a victim
[1:24:11] mentality,
[1:24:12] but a victor mentality.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; God has said, "I will empower you.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; I will grant to you the ability."
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. to have a power that
[1:24:24] will transform you
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; into a powerhouse of the living God.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; You're not going to be just little
[1:24:32] weaklings and just barely. I'm just
[1:24:34] hanging on. Let me tell you, my brother,
[1:24:37] my sister, the prophet of God says, "You
[1:24:39] watch what you have seen happen
[1:24:42] temporarily through my ministry." He
[1:24:45] says, "When that squeeze begins to come
[1:24:47] down, he says, you watch then that third
[1:24:49] pull." What is that third pull? the
[1:24:51] revealed word in its season. It isn't
[1:24:54] something that you pray about and say,
[1:24:56] "Oh, I want to speak squirrels." We're
[1:24:58] not talking about squirrels. We're not
[1:25:00] talking about healings. We're talking
[1:25:02] about the word of God when it's
[1:25:04] quickened,
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; when your situation with your family,
[1:25:09] with your need. Because it may not be
[1:25:12] squirrels.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; It may be something else, but every one
[1:25:15] of you have got an opportunity.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:21] and a responsibility.
[1:25:23] [Applause]
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; There is power in the spoken word.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; None of you are going to be exempt from
[1:25:32] it. All of you will face it. All of you
[1:25:36] are going to go through trials and
[1:25:38] testings.
[1:25:40] Just as our father Abraham was tested,
[1:25:43] so will we be tested.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Because we are the sons and daughters of
[1:25:50] Abraham by faith. Brother Brandon picks
[1:25:53] it up in the sermon, the adoption, 1960.
[1:25:56] Now, Canaan does not represent the age
[1:25:58] of the millennium. It represents the age
[1:26:01] of the overcomer, the dispensation of
[1:26:04] overcoming. Because in Canaan, they
[1:26:06] killed and burned and took cities. And
[1:26:08] there'll be no death in the millennium.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Now you all know that we that this
[1:26:15] battle that we fight, we do not fight
[1:26:17] against flesh and blood,
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; but against principalities and powers of
[1:26:22] the darkness.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Back in the days of Jesus,
[1:26:27] parents
[1:26:29] were not trying to be politically
[1:26:30] correct.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; They weren't trying to use words that
[1:26:34] would not offend others.
[1:26:37] Many a time they would come to Jesus and
[1:26:39] they said, "My daughter, my son is
[1:26:42] grievously vexed
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; with the devil."
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; They called it what it is.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand today that
[1:26:51] we must call what it is
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; what it is.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; They are spirits. They are demons. They
[1:26:57] are demonic oppressions.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; But we have a right to cast out devils,
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; to possess the gate of the enemy. It is
[1:27:06] our destiny to become an overcomer, not
[1:27:08] an undergoer.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; I want all of you to quit having pity
[1:27:13] parties. Oh, woe is me. I'm having such
[1:27:16] trials and testing. That's good for you.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Knowing that the trying of your faith is
[1:27:23] more precious to you than gold.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; So get happy about it. Put a smile on
[1:27:29] your face
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; and say that Goliath is coming down.
[1:27:38] Yes. The age of pressure and nervous
[1:27:40] tension.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; But that goes along
[1:27:45] with the age that we're living in.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said we've got to know
[1:27:50] how to let off the pressure. Most of us
[1:27:53] do not know how to let off the pressure.
[1:27:55] We add pressure.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; You don't pray. You don't read. You
[1:27:59] don't seek the mind of God. Yeah.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; And next thing you know, you're you're
[1:28:02] going through trials and issues and
[1:28:04] you're wondering, well, woe is me. Why
[1:28:07] is God allowing me to go through this?
[1:28:10] Many times, the trial you go through is
[1:28:13] self-inflicted.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; So much of the time, our sicknesses in
[1:28:21] our bodies are because we got the wrong
[1:28:23] kind of diet.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; We're not eating right. I mean, come on.
[1:28:28] Use your brain for something to just
[1:28:30] keep more than just keeping your ears
[1:28:33] apart.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; You sit there and eat all that junk
[1:28:39] food,
[1:28:41] everything. It just tears down your
[1:28:43] body.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and ask God to bless
[1:28:46] your Big Mac and give it all the
[1:28:48] nutrients and and everything that you
[1:28:50] need when you know it's junk food and
[1:28:52] it's just going to make you get big and
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Preach it.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Everything around us is affecting us.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that
[1:29:09] televisions, radios,
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; the internet, the cell phone, the
[1:29:14] magazines and the newspapers,
[1:29:17] everything is attacking the minds of the
[1:29:19] people.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:29:23] Never before has there ever been an age
[1:29:25] like this age.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; People's minds are going completely
[1:29:29] insane.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; 1965, brother Brandham says in a sermon,
[1:29:34] God's provided place of worship. Look at
[1:29:37] this teenage insane.
[1:29:39] Why? I told you the other day they was
[1:29:42] taking an analysis there in the schools
[1:29:45] of Arizona. Oh my.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. where I live and 80% of the
[1:29:52] children in school is mentally
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; What will their children be?
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; We can't have another generation. We're
[1:30:01] at the end. Jesus said these things
[1:30:04] would come. Look at all the television
[1:30:06] things getting these fictitious things
[1:30:08] in order. It'll come a time, I predict,
[1:30:10] that people will be completely and
[1:30:12] totally insane. The world will be. The
[1:30:15] Bible speaks of such hideous sites as
[1:30:18] they show in movies today of some
[1:30:20] prehistoric uh creatures egg that's
[1:30:23] lived in the earth for so many thousands
[1:30:25] millions of years hatch and come forth.
[1:30:28] Huh? That's just a minor thing to what's
[1:30:31] going to happen
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; when hell is open. The devil comes out
[1:30:34] with all of its mysterious things. Women
[1:30:37] locust with hair like women teeth like
[1:30:40] lion. Why the world will be completely
[1:30:42] totally insane. It's not but just one
[1:30:45] degree from it. Now,
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; the reason you feel the way you do so
[1:30:51] much of the time is because the cares of
[1:30:53] life
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; didn't say sin. Cares of life choke the
[1:30:57] seed.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; If you're I listen, I'm not talking
[1:31:00] about smoking and drinking and and
[1:31:02] running around. I'm talking about cares
[1:31:05] of life. Loudia that'll make you
[1:31:08] lukewarm.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; God said, "I'd rather you be hot or
[1:31:11] cold." Don't be lukewarm. Come on.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Too much of the time, what man calls
[1:31:15] middle of the road, God calls it
[1:31:17] lukewarm. God wants you to be on fire.
[1:31:20] God wants you to get a hold of him.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; He wants you to be
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're just going through the
[1:31:36] motions.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; There's no real sincerity in it.
[1:31:41] You're not praying. You're not seeking
[1:31:43] God like you should.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; They asked Brother Brennham in 1964,
[1:31:48] "Brother Brennham, what seems to be
[1:31:50] wrong in the day that we're living a
[1:31:52] believer and following the message and
[1:31:54] messenger of today when you cannot seem
[1:31:57] to pray like you would like to?" How
[1:32:00] many of you feel that kind of pressure?
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Why is it that I I'm having a hard time?
[1:32:07] That's a good question. I believe
[1:32:08] brother sister ever who asked it it's a
[1:32:12] co it's because of the conditions of the
[1:32:14] time the revival is over the revival is
[1:32:19] lasted some 15 years never did last over
[1:32:22] that uh about three years I believe it's
[1:32:25] received its last revival I believe
[1:32:28] that's why you can't pray and feel in
[1:32:30] the spirit like you used to is because
[1:32:32] the revival fires has gone out brother
[1:32:36] picks it up again and Abraham's covenant
[1:32:38] concern confirmed. America's revival is
[1:32:41] over. It ended about four years ago.
[1:32:44] It's over. There's no more revival in
[1:32:46] America. We're only gleaning in the
[1:32:48] fields that's already reaped and burnt
[1:32:50] over.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; You pick up a stock once in a while, but
[1:32:53] very few. My brother, my sister, I want
[1:32:55] you to understand as it was in the time
[1:32:57] of Boaz,
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; she found him harvest
[1:33:02] down harvesting the field. And when Boaz
[1:33:06] noticed her, he told those reapers of
[1:33:09] the field, "Leave her blessings.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Leave her handfuls."
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to understand, my
[1:33:16] brother and sister, every one of you, if
[1:33:18] you'll look and you'll seek, there are
[1:33:21] handfuls in your field,
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; and you need to reach out and say, "God,
[1:33:26] fill my apron full. I want to come back
[1:33:29] and prove to my family I've got
[1:33:31] blessings.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Handfuls.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; It's yours if you'll believe it.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; But you're looking for some big revival
[1:33:45] and all this and that. No, it's going on
[1:33:48] in the heart.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not all these people
[1:33:52] coming and big thousands. No, that it's
[1:33:56] not happening anymore.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; The big coliseums are filled with
[1:34:00] thousands of people coming to hear about
[1:34:02] Jesus. It's over.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; They'd rather have some rock concert.
[1:34:08] They'd rather have some big uh musician
[1:34:11] or or some kind of entertainment.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to entertain you. I'm here
[1:34:16] to preach to you the gospel. And I'll
[1:34:18] tell you what, if you need
[1:34:20] entertainment, this ain't the place to
[1:34:21] come.
[1:34:24] Amen.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; The seed is now coming to maturity.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; It's forcing all the greenness
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; out of the plant to go into the seed.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; The word is now becoming ripened within
[1:34:37] you.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; How do you know that the wheat is ready
[1:34:41] for harvest?
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; When it bows its head.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; It doesn't bring an arrogance. Yeah,
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; it doesn't bring a hottie, I know it all
[1:34:52] type spirit.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; In fact, the more I learn and the more
[1:34:56] revelation that God gives me, the more
[1:34:59] it makes me humble and I say, "Father,
[1:35:02] it's not me. It's you. It's not my
[1:35:05] keeping myself. It's you watching over
[1:35:08] your seed." Why? You made a covenant.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; And you said in Genesis 1:1, "Every seed
[1:35:15] will bring forth of its own kind." And
[1:35:18] if God ever had a seed, hallelujah, I
[1:35:21] want you to understand, if God ever had
[1:35:23] a seed and he planted it, and when it
[1:35:26] comes forth, what kind of seed would it
[1:35:28] be? It's going to be God's seed. It's
[1:35:30] going to be godlike. It's going to be
[1:35:33] God attributes.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said, "End time seed
[1:35:43] sign. There's a revival going on." What
[1:35:46] is it? the sewing. You don't hear much
[1:35:48] of Billy Graham no more or about oral.
[1:35:51] What about the rest of them? You know,
[1:35:52] the great revival fire is not burning.
[1:35:55] What is it? It's the end time seed sign.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; The words have has been sown.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; What is it? Denomination will reap
[1:36:05] denomination.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; That makes them confederate themselves
[1:36:09] together.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; But the word of God has been swed also.
[1:36:13] And when the spirit of God begins to
[1:36:15] fall,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; the word of God will live in the people.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; The word of God will live in the people.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; And the false bride that's committed
[1:36:26] adultery out there, brought herself into
[1:36:29] creeds, sold out her birthrights,
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; will reap what? A confederation of
[1:36:35] church. That's to be bound and burned
[1:36:37] like thorns and thistles. But where the
[1:36:40] word of God has been swed into the
[1:36:41] people's hearts, it will reap a bride
[1:36:44] for Christ.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; As certain as I'm standing here, what is
[1:36:48] it? End time signs.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; This evil age of laia that we live in is
[1:36:56] constantly wearing upon each one of us.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; It's all around us. It has an effect. We
[1:37:04] know that your environment has an effect
[1:37:06] upon you. Right.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Your work,
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; your school,
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; the music,
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; you can't hardly go anywhere and there's
[1:37:17] just all kinds of stuff bombarding your
[1:37:20] minds.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Greatest battle ever fought
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; is in your mind,
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; not in your heart. Thy word, oh God,
[1:37:32] have I hid in my heart. Most of you
[1:37:35] realize that your greatest battle is in
[1:37:39] your mind.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; And that's why you've got to take every
[1:37:42] thought,
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; everything that comes to you. Brother
[1:37:45] Brendom, how do I know if it's my
[1:37:47] thought? How do I know if it's me or if
[1:37:49] it's the devil putting He said, "If it's
[1:37:51] bad, if it's evil, if it's corrupt, it's
[1:37:54] the enemy."
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "Why?" The enemy has a right.
[1:37:59] Because you came into this earth hybrid
[1:38:02] born,
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:04] You came into this world through a
[1:38:08] hybrid birth. That's why the very first
[1:38:10] teaching of Jesus Christ. No, you not.
[1:38:13] You must be born again. Because except a
[1:38:15] man be born again, he will not
[1:38:17] understand the things of God.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to be have the new
[1:38:22] birth. And when you get the new birth,
[1:38:24] then all things become new. And
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; And you become a new creature in Christ
[1:38:30] Jesus.
[1:38:32] Yes, sir.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Peter, who do you say that I am?
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; He asked the disciples. Who do they say
[1:38:44] I am?
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Some say Jeremiah,
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel,
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Isaiah, one of the prophets. It might be
[1:38:52] John the Baptist raised up.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Peter was having something inside of
[1:38:59] him.
[1:39:01] that was coming forth. It was bursting
[1:39:04] out of him.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Peter
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; see Jesus could see it. He discerned
[1:39:13] Peter. Peter,
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; who do you say that I am?
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Thou art the Christ,
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; the son of the living God.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah. Flesh
[1:39:26] and blood did not give this to you. You
[1:39:28] didn't get it by a preacher. You didn't
[1:39:30] get it by your parents. You didn't get
[1:39:32] it by education. You didn't get it by
[1:39:35] theology. You got it from God himself
[1:39:38] because your father gives you
[1:39:40] revelation. And when it
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; When revelation strikes that word,
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; it'll quicken it.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; It'll absolutely quicken it until it
[1:39:53] brings forth life. And I'll tell you, if
[1:39:55] you who say that you're a son or
[1:39:58] daughter of God,
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; you can study your Bible, that's good.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; You can learn all these things. That's
[1:40:06] good.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; But when the heavenly father
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; quickens,
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; what you have heard
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; and it goes beyond your human intellect
[1:40:18] and all of a sudden
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; God gives you revelation. What is it?
[1:40:23] God giving you the very mind of himself
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; and then it has the power to transform
[1:40:36] you
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; not just memorizing Bible verses that's
[1:40:43] good
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; but if it doesn't change your life
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; if there is no changing of you
[1:40:52] change your church
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; because there must be something inside
[1:40:58] of you that is getting a transformation.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Those things which I once loved now I
[1:41:05] hate. And those things I once hated now
[1:41:07] I love
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; it ain't giving up something. It's
[1:41:16] getting something.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; It's getting revelation. Yes.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; And that power
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; when it strikes that seed
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; and and and gives to you revelation,
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that is the
[1:41:34] most powerful
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; thing you could ask God for.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Give me
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; revelation.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; I've heard all these things. I've heard
[1:41:44] stories. I read my Bible. I've
[1:41:46] memorized.
[1:41:50] You let a young girl
[1:41:52] hear about holiness dress. It's just
[1:41:56] legalism.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Until
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; it's revealed.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; It's not conforming.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Conform means to mold under pressure,
[1:42:11] but being transformed
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; by the renewing of your mind.
[1:42:16] If you young girls and you don't have a
[1:42:18] revelation of it, I tell you, get alone
[1:42:20] with him
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; and ask him, get on your knees
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; and ask God, God, what about holiness?
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Because if you look like the world and
[1:42:30] you act like the world and you talk like
[1:42:32] the world, the love of God is not even
[1:42:35] in you.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; God has called you to look different,
[1:42:38] act different, talk different.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you are different. You're
[1:42:42] from another kingdom.
[1:42:44] [Applause]
[1:42:45] Yes, sir.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. You're of another seed.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; This is the age where they call evil
[1:42:59] good and good evil.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; You are ought to be thankful that you
[1:43:05] are citizens of another kingdom. Yes.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Kingdom where there is no sin. There is
[1:43:10] no death.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; There is no murder, rape, or taxes.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; A kingdom where there's no sickness and
[1:43:17] suffering from diseases.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; I seek
[1:43:23] a kingdom whose builder
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; and maker is God.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; In every age, you will have the
[1:43:32] overcomers.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:36] There is going to be she may be a
[1:43:39] minority.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; But a minority with God is a majority.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. A minority with
[1:43:51] God is a majority.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Because you've got all heaven
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; behind you.
[1:44:01] We are encompassed
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; by such a cloud of witnesses.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, there is far more in this
[1:44:11] building right now than what we can see.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; There are angels.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; There are theophony beings.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; There are things that are hovering
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; right around. And if we could close our
[1:44:26] eyes and we could say, "God, let me see
[1:44:29] into that eternal realm right now.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Angels are here walking up and down the
[1:44:35] aisles waiting to give you something.
[1:44:37] But you got to ask."
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Ah, quit clowning around. Quit playing
[1:44:43] with God. You want to have something
[1:44:46] with God, get serious and ask him. He's
[1:44:50] God.
[1:44:53] Hallelujah.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; The unveiling of God did not stop with
[1:45:03] Jesus Christ.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Because Christ
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; is the mystery
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; of God.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. Christ
[1:45:16] is the mystery of God revealed. Amen.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Do you know if you went back into your
[1:45:22] Bible and you go to Genesis 1 and it
[1:45:25] says, "In the beginning, God."
[1:45:27] Then it goes in the next few verses and
[1:45:29] God said, "And God said and God said and
[1:45:32] God said and you keep reading down. And
[1:45:34] I've showed you in your Bibles. And then
[1:45:36] you come to the point where after he
[1:45:39] creates man, it never says and God said,
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; it says the Lord God,
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Elohim,
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; God has now given a portion of himself
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; and he's united it with man. So whenever
[1:45:57] he now speaks to man after he created
[1:46:00] him, it's not just God,
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; right? But a God who reveals,
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; a God who speaks,
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; now the Lord God,
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; and the Lord God said, and the Lord God,
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to understand
[1:46:16] that this unveiling of God has
[1:46:19] continued. It started before there was
[1:46:21] stardust.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; It started before there was time.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; And it's started to unfold. came down
[1:46:30] through Jesus Christ
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; who was the beginning of the creation of
[1:46:34] God.
[1:46:35] [Music]
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; He was the firstborn.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Because in him
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; was every elect seed.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? In him,
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Emmanuel, God with us.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:57] But the mystery continues.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; There's yet another mystery that is now
[1:47:03] being unfolded right now.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Because when we see Adam became the
[1:47:10] mystery of God revealed to the earth
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; because God is now revealing to the
[1:47:17] world his son
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Adam. And yet because God dwelt alone
[1:47:26] and he wanted a family,
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; And so Adam when he was here, he dwelt
[1:47:31] alone. Why? He was in the image
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; of God. But he says, "I'm going to put
[1:47:37] you asleep, Adam. And I'm going to take
[1:47:40] a mystery out of you."
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; And he laid Adam to sleep. And he took
[1:47:47] the feminist part because when you God
[1:47:50] God created man, he created him male and
[1:47:53] female. That's right.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; But he took out of him the male. He took
[1:47:59] out of him that female portion and he
[1:48:02] put it into another body.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; And when she came to Adam, she was the
[1:48:09] mystery
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; of Adam revealed.
[1:48:13] That's why she had to come to him to
[1:48:16] know who she is.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, you must come to him to
[1:48:21] know who you are.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; This world is without identification.
[1:48:27] They go to school, they go to education,
[1:48:30] they go to professors, they do all this
[1:48:32] stuff and they don't even know if
[1:48:34] they're male or female.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:42] There's only one way for you to know who
[1:48:44] you are.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; You got to go to him.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Your identity comes to you from your
[1:48:54] father.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Eve was a mystery of Adam revealed,
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; but it continues.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the bride is the mystery of
[1:49:10] Christ revealed.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; You want to know who I am?
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; I'm him revealed.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I show you a mystery. It's
[1:49:27] no longer I that live
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; but Christ
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; that liveth in me. And the life that I
[1:49:32] now live, I live by the faith of the Son
[1:49:34] of God. Hallelujah.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Do you realize
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; who you are?
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Colossians
[1:49:48] 1:es 25- 29.
[1:49:51] Whereof I am made a minister according
[1:49:54] to the dispensation of God which is
[1:49:57] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[1:49:59] of God.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even the mystery which hath been
[1:50:02] hid from the ages and from generations.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; But now.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; But now. Somebody say now.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Say it again. Now.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; My mother when she used to get want to
[1:50:14] get our attention. You boys come. Yes,
[1:50:18] mom. In just a minute. I said now. And
[1:50:21] you knew when she said now that that
[1:50:25] don't mean in 10 minutes. Come on.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; It means get your hide in movement.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; But
[1:50:36] now it's made manifest to his saints.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; It's happening.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; It's happening.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; To whom God would make known what is the
[1:50:47] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; among the Gentiles.
[1:50:56] which is
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; This mystery which has been hid from
[1:51:09] ages.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; But now is made manifest.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you. What does Christ
[1:51:23] mean? Anointed. Amen.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; If that same spirit that raised up
[1:51:30] Christ from the dead
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; be in you,
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; he will quicken
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; these mortal bodies.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Not to make you a church member, not to
[1:51:42] make you a religious person. God don't
[1:51:44] want religion. He wants a relationship.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want a fig leaf covering of
[1:51:50] religion. Hallelujah.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want rules and regulations.
[1:51:54] He wants a relationship. I want to
[1:51:57] reveal myself to you. And if you'll led
[1:51:59] me, this very mind that was in God will
[1:52:02] be in you.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Transferral of thought.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; That's what revelation is.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; God giving you his thoughts.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Good
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; revelation
[1:52:22] is God giving you
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; his thought.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; I cannot overemphasize.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; It'll quicken.
[1:52:38] I remember the first time
[1:52:43] when Revelation struck me and I was
[1:52:45] listening to a tape and I heard that
[1:52:48] prophet's voice.
[1:52:54] There was something that struck me
[1:52:55] inside.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:52:59] long-haired, dope smoking hippie surfer.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; And yet inside
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; like the woman at the well,
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; there was seed.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; When I heard that voice,
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; let me tell you, it was not the voice of
[1:53:16] the prophet.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; I heard a voice.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; I heard my father's voice.
[1:53:30] I heard the voice that spoke my name.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Before there was stardust.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Before the world began, he spake my
[1:53:42] name.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Every one of you have a name, but that
[1:53:48] only identifies you here on this earth.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; But you've got another name. Praise the
[1:53:56] Lord.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Part of the great mystery.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; And he says
[1:54:01] that hidden inside that rock,
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; that rock of revelation, he said he'll
[1:54:06] be given a new name. And brother
[1:54:08] Brennham says it'll perhaps be that name
[1:54:11] that you had
[1:54:14] that doesn't identify this.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; He says you might know this, but he said
[1:54:20] you don't really know me.
[1:54:25] Hallelujah.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Is this okay?
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; I've been thinking and reading about
[1:54:35] this age we're living in and studying.
[1:54:38] And we must be aware of the
[1:54:40] characteristics of this age
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; because it's going to have an effect. It
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; sure is.
[1:54:48] The world right now is getting into a
[1:54:51] survival mode.
[1:54:53] My son Amos sent me here a while back a
[1:54:58] a little video clip of these dooms
[1:55:01] doomsday preppers
[1:55:05] underground bunkers
[1:55:08] taking water putting them in shelters
[1:55:11] and food and stored up stuff because
[1:55:16] something's happening.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Listen, the world knows it. They know
[1:55:21] it. They're scared to death.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Something's fixing to happen.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; This world is falling apart. America is
[1:55:33] coming apart at the seams.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; You can't get the left and the right to
[1:55:37] agree with one another. Our government
[1:55:39] is shutting down.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Everything is shutting down. Our economy
[1:55:43] is shutting down. Everything is is in
[1:55:46] chaos.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's another kingdom.
[1:55:52] It's coming.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; And this one's got to fall apart.
[1:55:56] Another one is coming.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, the king is coming.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; And his kingdom he brings with him.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So let this world fall
[1:56:06] apart. I don't put my trust in money. I
[1:56:09] don't put my trust in Trump. I don't put
[1:56:12] my trust in the government. I don't put
[1:56:14] my trust in anything except for the word
[1:56:17] of God.
[1:56:19] Yes, sir.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth will pass away.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; But my word will never pass away.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; The bride is not preparing to survive
[1:56:30] the tribulation. She's preparing herself
[1:56:33] to go in the rapture.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Enoch prepared
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; to be caught up.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Noah prepared an ark
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; to go through.
[1:56:50] There's something about when you know
[1:56:51] you're going to go on a trip, you got to
[1:56:52] get prepared.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; My wife, I tell you, she starts
[1:56:56] preparing a week or two ahead of time.
[1:56:59] She's just get the get the suitcase out
[1:57:03] this and that and honey, did you get
[1:57:04] this and that and drives me nuts
[1:57:10] because I kind of just throw it in there
[1:57:12] last second. Not not her. She organizes.
[1:57:15] She thinks. So is the bride doing the
[1:57:17] same thing. I'm doing everything I can
[1:57:19] right now to think I'm not trying to
[1:57:21] find out how I can survive laia. I want
[1:57:24] to get out of LA.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not one to just undergo all of these
[1:57:29] situations. I want to overcome. I want
[1:57:31] to overcome the spirit that's in this
[1:57:33] age. I want to overcome all the things
[1:57:36] that are trying to take me down. Why?
[1:57:38] That's my destiny. I claim it. It's
[1:57:41] mine.
[1:57:45] Greater is he that's in you
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Listen, the diagnosis of Laiusa came
[1:57:58] from God himself.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the messenger.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; God himself.
[1:58:10] He says, "Thou sayest,
[1:58:13] you're rich and increase with goods,
[1:58:16] and have need of nothing, but knowest
[1:58:19] not
[1:58:21] that thou are poor,
[1:58:23] miserable, blind, wretched, and naked,
[1:58:27] and you don't even know it."
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; What a horrible condition.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; I took the wife the other day. We were
[1:58:39] shopping.
[1:58:40] She had to go to HomeGoods or somewhere.
[1:58:42] And I said, I I'm going to just sit out
[1:58:45] front. I sat out on the front with my
[1:58:48] little dog on a bench.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; And I just watched the people coming and
[1:58:54] going in and out. I didn't see one woman
[1:58:57] in a dress.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Not one. Except for my wife.
[1:59:08] rest of them,
[1:59:11] whether they were skinny or fat,
[1:59:15] with a nice body or with a
[1:59:20] body.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; I tell you,
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; it was bad.
[1:59:34] I thought, "Oh my goodness,
[1:59:37] if I look like that,
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; I'd hide."
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; But
[1:59:45] I don't try to make a joke out of it.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; What What would make What would make the
[1:59:49] people do this?
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; That's why.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; What would make you sisters dress the
[1:59:58] way you do?
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; A spirit. Amen.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; because without holiness,
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; no man shall see God.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; You sisters, I tell you, let me salute
[2:00:15] you right now
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; because I say, Yeah. Yeah. Come on, give
[2:00:20] them a hand.
[2:00:29] I told my wife, I said, "Sweetheart,
[2:00:31] you're the only woman I saw that wore a
[2:00:34] a dress coming in and out." And she
[2:00:36] said, "I'm I'm just used to it. I don't
[2:00:38] even think about it."
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; And I said, "I am so proud of you."
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; And I may may I take my hat off to you
[2:00:48] sisters?
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Because we we we men, we can kind of fit
[2:00:52] in. You wear,
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; you know, you wear a pair of pants and
[2:00:56] you're not wearing shorts and
[2:00:57] everything. You can kind of fit in. You
[2:00:59] could we don't have to uh you know our
[2:01:02] hair we you know if you were a Jew if
[2:01:05] you were a Jew a boy and you had the the
[2:01:07] ringlets huh
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of you hide the
[2:01:12] ringlets man
[2:01:17] but you sisters you can't hide
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; I I I watch some of you girls you you go
[2:01:24] out here and you play sports
[2:01:28] and you wear dress.
[2:01:32] I thought, "Oh, God,
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; you wear a dress when everybody else is
[2:01:41] wearing their little spandex shorties."
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh, God, bless our girls."
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Our young women.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; I do. I say, "God bless them."
[2:02:00] You sisters,
[2:02:03] the way you dress when you go to when
[2:02:05] you go to out here in your you're
[2:02:08] shopping
[2:02:10] and and you're going anywhere. Do you
[2:02:13] realize, brother Brandham said that that
[2:02:16] one woman, he says there in the midst of
[2:02:19] all these kids and the rebels and all of
[2:02:22] the this and that, he said that one old
[2:02:25] lady that was dressed nice, he says God
[2:02:29] allowed her to bring judgment.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that what you're doing?
[2:02:36] You're showing to those to the world
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; what a woman should look at.
[2:02:42] You should you should be proud
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; you should say I'm doing this for him.
[2:02:48] This is not me
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; and the works that I do. I'm not doing
[2:02:52] it because I want to, you know, no, I'm
[2:02:55] doing it because I love him.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If you love me, you keep my
[2:03:00] commandments."
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Works are a visible manifestation of
[2:03:05] what you believe.
[2:03:08] This is the age wherein Satan has had
[2:03:10] 6,000 years since Adam to perfect sin.
[2:03:15] This is Satan's Eden.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, just look around.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; And if we cannot be differentiated from
[2:03:24] those out there,
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; there is no revelation in your life
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; because your revelation will make a
[2:03:33] manifestation. You show me a person that
[2:03:36] says they have faith and I'll see their
[2:03:38] see their faith by the works.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; You understand it?
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Second Corinthians 4:es 3-6. But if our
[2:03:48] gospel be hid,
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; it's hid to them that are lost.
[2:03:54] and whom the God of this world hath
[2:03:56] blinded the minds of them which believe
[2:04:00] not, lest the light of this glorious
[2:04:03] gospel of Christ, who is the image of
[2:04:05] God should shine unto them. God is
[2:04:08] light.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the light of the
[2:04:11] world."
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; And the light that I give to man
[2:04:19] is the light of life.
[2:04:23] There's something about light that is
[2:04:25] lifegiving.
[2:04:28] Hallelujah.
[2:04:31] God is light.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; And we are children of light.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; I remember the first sermon that I
[2:04:38] preached.
[2:04:41] They asked me to preach in Flex
[2:04:43] Tabernacle years ago. Young boy.
[2:04:47] And I did not remember the name of my
[2:04:50] sermon, but Sister Mary Dalton She said,
[2:04:53] "Brother Ron, I still have the notes of
[2:04:56] your first sermon."
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; She said, "Do you remember what you
[2:04:59] preached?" I said, "No, I don't." She
[2:05:01] said, "The children of light."
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; My
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; children of light. You realize that God
[2:05:11] is light.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; And that they Einstein and all of these
[2:05:16] great scientific minds said, "If we
[2:05:19] could reach to the speed of light,
[2:05:22] time stops.
[2:05:25] If we could go to light speed,
[2:05:28] we could come to a threshold where time
[2:05:30] there is no more time.
[2:05:32] It just enters into an eternal realm.
[2:05:35] And then if I could go faster
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; than the speed of light,
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; I could reverse time.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; I go back to the future.
[2:05:54] Because what we see here now
[2:05:57] is the after effect.
[2:06:00] But if we could enter into light speed,
[2:06:04] I'll take you back
[2:06:07] to where you were.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; The mind of God.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; I'll take you back before there was a
[2:06:14] fall.
[2:06:15] I'll take you back
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; into my very mind where I conceived you.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. I just seem to be a little
[2:06:29] overcome right now.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Says, "The God of this world has blinded
[2:06:38] the minds of them that believe not."
[2:06:42] Why do you believe what you believe?
[2:06:45] Why do you believe this Bible?
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Jim, I don't really know why I
[2:06:55] do. I just do.
[2:06:58] Amen.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Because I believe
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; when I heard it, the first time I ever
[2:07:08] heard about Jesus, I wasn't I wasn't
[2:07:10] raised in church. My parents were not
[2:07:13] religious people.
[2:07:16] Jesus Christ was a cuss word.
[2:07:20] Never never one time did we go to
[2:07:23] church.
[2:07:24] Never did we ever have family devotions.
[2:07:28] Did we ever pray together.
[2:07:31] In fact, when I came to Christ and I
[2:07:35] gave my life to God, my father begged
[2:07:38] me, don't don't serve God. Don't serve
[2:07:42] Jesus. That's for weaklings. That's for
[2:07:45] people who Son, if you're going to make
[2:07:47] something out of yourself, you're going
[2:07:49] to have to make it.
[2:07:51] You yourself. Why though? Look at those
[2:07:53] people. They're weaklings.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; You think I'm a weakling?
[2:08:11] Carry this with you to school.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Carry it to your work.
[2:08:23] Yeah,
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; I had my Bible stolen in high school at
[2:08:33] school at lunchtime. I had it there. I
[2:08:36] had all my notes in it. You know how you
[2:08:38] do? You might write all your notes and
[2:08:40] everything like they stole my Bible. I
[2:08:42] got so upset. I says, "Can you imagine?
[2:08:47] They stole my Bible.
[2:08:51] And I thought, why don't I pray for them
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; that they'll read it.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; I had on the I I had on the front page
[2:09:02] here, read the Bible. It'll scare the
[2:09:06] hell out of you.
[2:09:09] I thought I hope they read it.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:19] I didn't get my Bible back.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; But I asked God, God, whoever took it.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; If they meant it for maliciousness,
[2:09:29] forgive them. But I pray that they read
[2:09:32] it.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; See, the Bible is not for you to sit on
[2:09:36] the coffee table or up on the shelf
[2:09:38] somewhere and to say, "I've got a
[2:09:40] Bible." No. The Bible's to be read.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; The Bible is for you to read. It is a
[2:09:45] compass. It is a light.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; It is a way that'll show you your
[2:09:50] destiny.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Every other book, do you realize that
[2:09:55] this is the bestseller every year?
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; I just love to speak the name
[2:10:07] of Jesus.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; I can't help it.
[2:10:15] I'm sorry. I'm overcome.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; I fell in love with him.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; The first time I heard the story of
[2:10:25] Jesus, I said, "Who am I?" I was told
[2:10:28] the story that he bled and died. He gave
[2:10:30] his life for me.
[2:10:33] I said, "Who am I
[2:10:35] that a king
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; would bleed and die for?
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Who am I?
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; I don't understand this. For God so
[2:10:46] loved the world that he gave his only
[2:10:48] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[2:10:50] him shall not perish but shall have
[2:10:52] everlasting life.
[2:10:56] Who am I?
[2:11:01] It wasn't until
[2:11:03] I came to the revelation in this hour
[2:11:07] I knew my identity.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; I knew where I come from. I knew my
[2:11:13] origin.
[2:11:16] And like on a Coke bottle,
[2:11:19] I got a revelation off a Coke bottle one
[2:11:21] time. No deposit,
[2:11:24] no return.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Unless you have something deposited
[2:11:28] inside of you. Listen, Jesus said, "All
[2:11:31] that the Father hath given me
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; will come."
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You can fight all you want.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; You can resist all you want, but you're
[2:11:43] coming.
[2:11:45] You're coming. Whether you come
[2:11:46] screaming and hollering and dragging
[2:11:49] your heels or something, you're coming.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; And you don't think that, hey, listen,
[2:11:53] God is the greatest fisherman. And once
[2:11:55] he's got you hooked, you're hooked.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You're coming. You
[2:12:00] don't Whoa, man. I'm Yeah, I ain't
[2:12:03] coming. I ain't coming. Yeah, you're
[2:12:05] coming. I don't want to go to church
[2:12:06] three times a week. I don't like Bible
[2:12:08] study.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; I want movies, music.
[2:12:14] You're coming.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Fight all you want.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Fight all you want. A good fisherman. He
[2:12:21] loves a good fight.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; John Dubsky. He said, "Hey, if you
[2:12:25] haven't ever gone fishing with John
[2:12:27] Dubsky, go fishing with him one time."
[2:12:29] This guy gets so excited. He He Hey,
[2:12:31] brother Ron. Brother Ron. Watch this. He
[2:12:34] said, "Right over there."
[2:12:37] Yeah. Come on, baby. Come on. Yeah.
[2:12:39] Okay. Yeah. No. No. Okay. Now I got to
[2:12:42] get out the good stuff, you know. He

[2:12:58] like that. John, he just goes and
[2:12:59] getting so excited. You're coming, man.
[2:13:02] You're coming. Yeah. Oh, Ron, look at
[2:13:04] this. Look at the fight.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:11] when you got hooked.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; You got hooked
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; and you're coming
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; until you know.
[2:13:24] What is it? What is it? What does he do
[2:13:26] when the line keeps going
[2:13:30] just set the set the drag?
[2:13:33] [Music]
[2:13:46] your last little
[2:13:49] until
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; till your eyeballs pop out
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; because God will not lose one of you.
[2:14:06] There's something happening
[2:14:08] in the world today
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; and everybody's realizing they're
[2:14:13] feeling it
[2:14:15] because there's coming a change.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; There's coming a change.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:27] Isaiah chapter 60 verses 1-3. Musicians,
[2:14:32] if you come,
[2:14:34] I never really got into my sermon this
[2:14:36] morning.
[2:14:48] has come
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[2:14:52] thee.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; And behold, the darkness shall cover the
[2:14:56] earth and gross darkness the people. But
[2:14:59] the Lord shall arise upon thee,
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; and his glory
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; shall be seen,
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; upon thee.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; And the Gentiles shall come to the
[2:15:12] light, and kings to the brightness of
[2:15:15] thy rising.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:18] This is the greatest conflict that has
[2:15:20] ever happened. What is it? Light versus
[2:15:23] darkness.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of Satan and the kingdom of
[2:15:28] God
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; are in the greatest conflict right now.
[2:15:31] And you're right in the very midst of
[2:15:33] the heat of the battle.
[2:15:39] But while there was
[2:15:42] in that first Exodus,
[2:15:46] there was darkness and death in Egypt.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Yet there was light in Goan.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; You realize that?
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; There was light in Goan. and what
[2:16:03] separated them and the others that tried
[2:16:06] to get over to them and they couldn't
[2:16:08] because the pillar of fire separated.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; You realize that God is with you.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll be with you even in you
[2:16:17] until the end of the world."
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; We just was over in Thailand.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; These are new Christians. These are
[2:16:30] people just come out of Buddhism.
[2:16:35] They've just heard the name of Jesus
[2:16:37] Christ.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; People
[2:16:45] have gone over there. Brother Ron, your
[2:16:48] son's gone over there and shared with
[2:16:50] these people and told them about an end
[2:16:53] time message.
[2:16:55] They don't understand it all.
[2:16:59] They're just new sincere babes in
[2:17:01] Christ. You don't try to give them a big
[2:17:04] piece of meat right now. Just let them
[2:17:07] just talk about the love of God
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; and what God has done in this age. As it
[2:17:12] was in the days of Noah, so shall it be.
[2:17:15] As it was in the days of Sod, so shall
[2:17:17] it be. And you begin to just talk to
[2:17:19] him. One thing about it, man, though,
[2:17:21] you know, I love to meet new Christians
[2:17:24] that just are excited about talking
[2:17:27] about him.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that's the greatest thing I
[2:17:31] can talk about. I could care less who
[2:17:33] plays the Super Bowl.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; I could care less about all of the
[2:17:36] sports and things. And
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; Give me Jesus.
[2:17:49] Amen.
[2:17:51] But the darker it gets,
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; the greater the light shines.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; You may not think that your light is
[2:18:00] very bright,
[2:18:04] but just let the darkness
[2:18:06] come. Sometime you'll see how great
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; is your light.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I appreciate all of you. Thank you
[2:18:14] for coming. Our visitors and different
[2:18:16] ones. Amos, you got your friend here, a
[2:18:19] buddy came. You You witnessed to him.

[2:18:24] you here today. Want you to come back.
[2:18:26] We're We're different.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; We're unique. The Bible calls you
[2:18:32] peculiar people.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; We're dangerous.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; His lives change.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Worlds get turned upside down.
[2:18:44] Amen.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Arise, shine,
[2:18:52] for the light is
[2:18:59] shine,
[2:19:00] for the light has come
[2:19:05] and the glory of the Lord is risen.
[2:19:09] And the glory of the Lord is come.
[2:19:13] And the glory of the Lord has risen upon
[2:19:18] me.
[2:19:20] I shine.
[2:19:23] Shine
[2:19:25] for the light is
[2:19:31] shine.
[2:19:33] For the high is come
[2:19:37] and the glory of the Lord is risen. And
[2:19:42] the glory of the Lord is come.
[2:19:45] And the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[2:19:50] me.
[2:19:51] [Music]
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:56] What a a blessing it is to be a
[2:19:59] Christian.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; I do not
[2:20:03] I do not feel that being a Christian is
[2:20:06] grievious or burdensome.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come unto me all ye that are
[2:20:12] weary and are heavy laden and I will
[2:20:14] give you rest. Peace I will give you,
[2:20:17] not as the world gives."
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; He says, "Come learn of me, for I am
[2:20:23] meek and lowly."
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; Take my yoke upon you.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; For my yoke is easy.
[2:20:33] and my burden is light. Brother Dave
[2:20:34] Maple, would you come here, my brother?
[2:20:36] Come here. Come on up here.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Would you dismiss us in a word of
[2:20:48] prayer? I'm happy to see you, Brother
[2:20:50] David.
[2:20:51] [Music]
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; It's good to be here.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[2:21:02] I've been seeking the Lord for answers,
[2:21:06] direction in my life
[2:21:09] and you are a blessing to me.
[2:21:12] I come here one time and I said,
[2:21:15] "If God be with us, where are the
[2:21:17] miracles?"
[2:21:19] And you see many people healed
[2:21:24] receiving a blessing from God,
[2:21:28] but that's not the greatest miracle.
[2:21:30] That's good.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; The greatest miracle is sitting beside
[2:21:34] you.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; When God reaches down his hand and
[2:21:39] touches the hearts of your family
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; and your friends and opens up their
[2:21:45] eyes.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; There's the miracles.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; My friends, God
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; has richly,
[2:21:53] richly blessed you. Yes, he has.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; And I want to thank him today.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; And I thank brother Roy for asking me to
[2:22:00] come up here because I've been seeking
[2:22:03] more light from God.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; And today we've heard some wonderful
[2:22:08] things.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; The light has come and has shined upon
[2:22:12] you.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Heavenly Father, what
[2:22:17] a blessing it is for all of us to be
[2:22:19] here
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; to hear your word and to know you are
[2:22:24] our God, our father, and we are your
[2:22:27] children. Lord, we thank you for this
[2:22:30] service. And may your blessing be upon
[2:22:32] each and every individual that's in this
[2:22:35] gathering today. In Jesus Christ's name
[2:22:38] I pray.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother David.
[2:22:45] Amen.
[2:22:47] Listen, we started this this service
[2:22:50] with I speak the name of Jesus and that
[2:22:52] brought us such a presence. Did you feel
[2:22:54] that
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; when we sang it? I'd like to close this
[2:22:57] service with singing it. And I'll tell
[2:22:59] you, let me just give you a clue. Do you
[2:23:02] remember was I was in the hospital. I
[2:23:04] was I had a near-death experience.
[2:23:10] I heard this song
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; being sung outside
[2:23:18] my uh room that I was in in the
[2:23:21] hospital. I heard it. I heard him
[2:23:22] singing. There is power in the name
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; of Jesus.
[2:23:28] And I took my cell phone. I got up. I I
[2:23:30] asked my nurse, "Are they letting people
[2:23:33] sing out in the parking lot?"
[2:23:37] Why? I've never heard such singing. So I
[2:23:41] went to the parking lot. I I or excuse
[2:23:43] me to the window out on the parking lot.
[2:23:45] I looked outside, took my cell phone. I
[2:23:48] could hear it. I could hear it so
[2:23:50] plainly that I turned my cell phone on
[2:23:53] to record
[2:23:56] and I took four different
[2:23:59] movies, whatever you call it, you know,
[2:24:01] when you video.
[2:24:04] I told Sandy, I said, "Sandy,
[2:24:07] I recorded it.
[2:24:10] I heard the voice,
[2:24:12] but it wasn't
[2:24:15] it wasn't with the physical ear."
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:24:22] [Music]
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; And so this song is very, very special
[2:24:27] to me.
