[0:00] You know what? She's not.
[0:03] She's just waiting on us. [snorts]
[0:06] So, let's bow our heads.
[0:10] Father, would we take this opportunity,
[0:12] Lord, that you've given us a space and
[0:15] time, Lord,
[0:17] to honor a a woman, Father, a [snorts]
[0:21] daughter of God.
[0:25] And we want to [snorts] let you know,
[0:28] Lord, we thank you for
[0:31] her crossing our paths, Lord, that she
[0:34] was a blessing to us.
[0:38] That wherever she went, you know, she
[0:39] blessed those around her.
[0:42] Father, we just ask you now, Lord, just
[0:45] [snorts] put your stamp upon this little
[0:47] memorial. Father,
[0:50] we don't mourn, Father, for her death,
[0:52] Lord, but
[0:54] we rejoice, Lord,
[0:57] because if we could trade places, Lord,
[1:01] she wouldn't want to come back
[1:05] and we know that.
[1:07] And there's nothing that we can think or
[1:09] dream up of what it's like.
[1:12] But Father, we're standing here and we
[1:14] ask you, Lord, to come down [snorts]
[1:18] and bless this little memorial. Father,
[1:21] for your glory, Father, was glorified
[1:24] through her life, [snorts]
[1:27] we just commit this time to you, Father,
[1:30] in the precious name of our Lord and
[1:31] Savior Jesus Christ. [snorts]
[1:34] Amen.
[1:36] So, Brother Chris is going to come up
[1:38] and give the eulogy.
[1:52] I bless you.
[1:55] She was special.
[1:58] She was honory, too. Just to say,
[2:03] I'd always go up there and say, "Have
[2:04] you been honory today?" Yeah. [laughter]
[2:08] All right. Sister Anna asked me to read
[2:11] this. Mary survived by her children
[2:14] Rachel, her husband Frank, Ruth, Esther,
[2:17] Robert,
[2:19] her his wife Jodie, Martha,
[2:23] her husband Ruben, Elena, Anna, and
[2:26] John. She had 14 grandchildren.
[2:30] Dedra, Sarah, Sam, Becky, Leah, Jessica,
[2:38] Jamal,
[2:40] Miranda, Mario, Ruben, McKenna, Ian,
[2:44] Jack, and Emma. She had 25 great
[2:47] grandchildren.
[2:49] Andrew, Elijah, Genesis, Armiah, Alex,
[2:54] Jordan, Ma,
[2:57] Damen, Jordan, Brandon,

[3:05] Bobby, Ma, Matthew, Evan, Kai, Ka,
[3:10] Taylor, Sydney, Mlin, Weston, Jasmine,
[3:16] Chloe, and Riley. And she had 10 great
[3:18] great grandchildren. She had quite a
[3:21] legacy.
[3:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Proves she lived a long life.
[3:28] She was Sister Mary. She was she was
[3:32] something. I'm sorry. I you know I known
[3:34] her and brother Rudy I don't know
[3:37] probably 25 years 30 years. I don't know
[3:40] how long. It's been a long time. But
[3:41] they were always faithful, always
[3:44] attended.
[3:45] Uh they were they were a lighthouse to
[3:49] their family,
[3:51] you know, they were always dedicated.
[3:53] They always served the Lord that all the
[3:55] times I knew them and they they were
[3:57] just they were an inspiration.
[3:59] &gt;&gt; Um she's sister Anna's also asked me to
[4:02] do a song. Um usually I do the
[4:05] lighthouse,
[4:07] but I just felt different with sister
[4:09] Mary. Um I'm going do Amazing Grace
[4:13] because it was
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amazing grace.
[4:17] You know, [snorts] when you when you
[4:18] come down to the end of life, end of
[4:21] your road, it's only one thing that
[4:23] matters.
[4:25] When we're young, we strive to get a
[4:27] house, to make money, all this kind of
[4:30] stuff. But when you get older,
[4:34] one thing that matters,
[4:36] have you served the Lord? Have you made
[4:38] that decision in your life to accept
[4:40] Jesus Christ as your savior? She did
[4:42] that many years ago. her and brother
[4:44] Rudy and they lived a life before this
[4:47] church, before us people. They lived a
[4:49] life according to God's word. And I'm
[4:51] thankful for that.
[4:57] I see any of this or
[5:00] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[5:12] amazed
[5:15] grace
[5:17] how sweet
[5:20] the sound
[5:23] that saved
[5:25] all edge
[5:28] like me.
[5:34] I once
[5:36] was lost.
[5:39] Oh, but now
[5:42] I'm found.
[5:44] I was blind,
[5:47] but [singing] now
[5:50] I see.
[5:56] was grace
[5:59] that taught
[6:01] oh my heart
[6:04] to fear
[6:07] and grace
[6:10] my fears [singing]
[6:12] relieved.
[6:18] How precious
[6:21] day
[6:23] that grace
[6:26] appeared
[6:29] the hour.
[6:32] I first
[6:34] believe
[6:40] when we've
[6:43] been there
[6:45] 10,000
[6:49] years
[6:51] bright shining
[6:54] as
[6:56] the son. [singing]
[7:01] Oh, we've known
[7:04] less days
[7:07] to [singing] sing
[7:10] God's praise
[7:13] than when
[7:15] oh we first
[7:18] beun. Sing Amazing Grace with me.
[7:24] Amazing
[7:27] grace,
[7:29] how sweet
[7:32] the sound
[7:35] that saved
[7:38] a wretch
[7:40] like me. [singing]
[7:45] Oh, I [singing] once
[7:48] was lost.
[7:51] Oh, but now
[7:54] I'm found.
[7:56] Oh, I was blind,
[7:59] but now
[8:02] I see.
[8:16] Thanks, brother Chris.
[8:19] Well, this was
[8:21] Brother Rome was just too wore out.
[8:24] [sighs and gasps]
[8:25] So he he excused himself and Sister
[8:29] Hannah went back and he she's totally
[8:34] understanding, you know, poured his
[8:36] heart out this morning. Just wore out.
[8:40] So I kind of sprung it on Brother Steve.
[8:43] He was like, you know, hey, and it was
[8:46] just, you know what? Hey,
[8:48] in season, out of season, God gives his
[8:52] gifts something to say. [snorts]
[8:55] And you know, if you could just say just
[8:58] you said, "Well, I didn't know her."
[9:00] He knew her from the for the foundation
[9:03] of the world.
[9:07] Okay.
[9:20] Praise the Lord.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; My you look at this picture here
[9:25] compared to this picture up here. And uh
[9:28] this is the one I want to look at right
[9:30] here because that's the one I'm going to
[9:32] recognize when we cross over to the
[9:35] other side. But um in the book of Job,
[9:39] the Bible says Job chapter uh 14, it
[9:43] says, "Man that is born of a woman is of
[9:46] few days and full of trouble." We can
[9:49] all say amen to that. He cometh forth
[9:52] like a flower and is cut down. He fleth
[9:54] also as a shadow, and contin
[9:57] thou open thine eyes upon such and one,
[10:00] and bringest me into judgment with thee.
[10:03] Who can bring a clean thing out of an
[10:06] unclean? Not one. Seeing his days are
[10:09] determined, the number of his months are
[10:11] with thee. Thou hast appointed his uh
[10:15] bonds that he cannot pass his bounds.
[10:18] Turn from him that he may rest till he
[10:21] shall accomplish as an hireling his day.
[10:24] For there is hope of a tree, if it be
[10:27] cut down, that it will sprout again, and
[10:30] that the tender branch thereof will not
[10:33] cease. Though the root thereof waxs old
[10:36] in the earth, and the stock thereof die
[10:38] in the ground, yet through the scent of
[10:41] water, it will bud and bring forth bows
[10:43] like a plant. But man dieth, and wasteth
[10:47] away. Yeah, man giveth up the ghost, and
[10:51] where is he? As the waters fail from the
[10:54] sea, and the flood decayth and dryth up,
[10:58] so man lith down and riseth not, till
[11:01] the heavens be no more. They shall not
[11:03] awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.
[11:05] Oh, that thou wouldest hide me in the
[11:07] grave, that thou wouldest keep me
[11:09] secret, until thy wrath be passed, that
[11:12] thou wouldest appoint me a set time and
[11:15] remember me. If a man die, shall he live
[11:18] again? All the days of my appointment
[11:21] time, appointed time will I wait till my
[11:25] change come. So we can see that Job had
[11:30] a question in his mind and and as Job
[11:33] would look at the natural things, he
[11:35] would look at the tree and the flower
[11:37] and and he would see that if a man cut
[11:40] down a tree um and and and burneth it up
[11:45] and take it away, we see that the tree
[11:48] if it's under kind of condition, it's
[11:51] going to bring forth a life again. It's
[11:53] going to bring forth a branch. is going
[11:55] to bring forth a bow. And and he's
[11:57] looking at these natural types and he's
[11:59] and he's questioning within himself and
[12:02] he's saying, "But what happens to a man
[12:05] that when a man dies and he goes into
[12:07] the grave? What happens to him? Where
[12:10] does he go? What what what is the end of
[12:13] of man after the grave?" And it is a
[12:17] question that has been upon all of our
[12:20] hearts and all of our minds at at at at
[12:23] some point in our lives. And it's very
[12:26] interesting when you begin to read
[12:29] through the book of Job of Job's
[12:31] comforters and this one comes and
[12:33] accuses him of this and accuses him of
[12:36] that and and Job is is down through his
[12:39] journey. No doubt this question is still
[12:42] in his mind because we're always
[12:45] wondering what happens to life after we
[12:49] die here. What what is there beyond the
[12:52] grave? Is there anything there? Is it
[12:55] just or is there nothing there? Is it
[12:57] just you're just in a deep sleep and
[12:59] it's nothing? Or or is there a life
[13:01] beyond this life that we're living? And
[13:05] Job comes to a conclusion in his own
[13:08] life and he answers this question by
[13:12] revelation to himself. And as you look
[13:16] at Job's life, you know, God does the
[13:18] same thing for us. A lot of times we
[13:22] have questions in our lives and we
[13:24] wonder about things and we and we ask
[13:26] and we ponder and we think but God
[13:30] brings us to a place in our life where
[13:32] he gives us a revelation of the
[13:35] questions that we once had
[13:38] and he h he answers this question
[13:42] himself
[13:43] in chapter 19 and verse 21 it reads uh
[13:49] I'll just Read this through. Have pity
[13:51] upon me, oh ye, my friends, for the hand
[13:54] of God has touched me. And uh he says,
[13:56] "Why persecute me as God, and are not
[13:59] satisfied with my flesh? Oh, that my
[14:01] words were now written. Oh, that they
[14:04] were printed in a book, that they were
[14:06] graven with an iron pen, and led in the
[14:09] rock forever. For I know that my
[14:12] redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand
[14:15] at the latter day upon the earth. And
[14:18] though after my skin worms destroy this
[14:21] body, yet in my flesh shall I see God,
[14:26] whom I shall see for myself,
[14:30] and mine eyes shall be whole and not
[14:33] another, though my reigns be consumed in
[14:37] me. And so Job has finally come to a
[14:41] place and he says,"I know that my
[14:45] redeemer liveth and I know that after my
[14:49] skin worms eat this flesh that in this
[14:51] flesh I shall see God." And so he had a
[14:56] a a revelation a aha moment. the the
[15:00] light turned on that he realized that
[15:03] this flesh that shall decay someday in
[15:06] the grave. It shall rise again and
[15:09] within this flesh I shall see God. And
[15:13] [snorts] we know that the Bible says
[15:14] that uh in my father's house are many
[15:18] mansions. If it were not so uh I would
[15:22] have told you. He says I go to prepare a
[15:24] place for you that where I am there ye
[15:28] may be also. And now we we live in a
[15:31] time where
[15:33] we we don't have to guess no more
[15:36] &gt;&gt; and we don't have to wander anymore.
[15:39] Brother Brandham said, you know, I I
[15:41] always wondered about what how heaven
[15:44] would be and what it would be like. And
[15:47] I always wondered and I thought, my
[15:49] will, will will brother Neville just be
[15:51] a cloud that passes by and we'll just be
[15:55] a clouds and and we won't have hands to
[15:57] shake each other's hands and but we'll
[16:00] know who each other is. And God lets him
[16:04] pass beyond the curtain of time.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; You know, God didn't only let that
[16:09] happen for brother Brandham, but he let
[16:12] that happen for you and I.
[16:15] So that the question would be answered
[16:18] of what is beyond the grave. We don't
[16:22] have to uh think of or imagine things or
[16:25] or wander and ponder of of perhaps what
[16:29] it'll be like. He gave us a glimpse into
[16:32] the afterlife of how it will be and who
[16:36] will how the people will look when we
[16:38] see them. That's why when I look at this
[16:41] picture, th this picture is is is an old
[16:44] picture of of how we remember Sister
[16:48] Mary. And I had only met Sister Mary uh
[16:51] a few times and when we went to the
[16:53] house and visited and uh you know she
[16:56] always had such a good attitude and uh
[17:00] and you talk about a real fighter, huh?
[17:02] She never wanted to give up. And brother
[17:05] Chris said she's honory. You know, only
[17:08] an honorary person recognizes other
[17:10] honory people.
[17:13] And only honory people can call other
[17:15] people honory.
[17:17] This is a three-way tie here, Brother
[17:19] Chris.
[17:21] [laughter]
[17:24] But this picture that we see here was is
[17:27] a picture of a a let me say it like
[17:29] this, a decaying body and a decaying
[17:33] image. But the image that we see up here
[17:36] is the image that was in the mind of God
[17:39] since before the foundations of the
[17:41] world. And when we cross over, whether
[17:45] it be a translation of our bodies or if
[17:47] God is to take us by the way of the
[17:50] grave, this is the image that we're
[17:52] going to see of Sister Mary. And so she
[17:56] has certainly crossed over to her reward
[18:00] and she has crossed over to her
[18:02] sweetheart. And no doubt they're holding
[18:04] hands and and and who knows what they're
[18:06] talking about. We can use our
[18:08] imagination for that. But I am thankful
[18:11] that that God changes lives and that
[18:16] those lives when they're changed, they
[18:18] are lived before us. And no doubt all of
[18:21] you could come up here and you could
[18:23] give a an example or a story of Sister
[18:26] Mary um of of how she touched or
[18:29] impacted your life either directly or
[18:33] indirectly. We could all do that. And so
[18:36] sister Anna, we we rejoice with you
[18:40] and we cry with you and we are here for
[18:44] you and don't ever forget that. And um
[18:48] God bless you all. We're just I'm I'm
[18:50] honored that I could be a a a part of
[18:53] this here today. And um just may God
[18:57] richly bless you all. Amen.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what it looks like. Thank
[19:10] you, brother Stephen. you know that
[19:13] that's why sometimes you don't you can
[19:15] plan and this and that and this is going
[19:17] to happen and but when you let God deal
[19:20] with it and have it it works out
[19:23] perfect. So I think Sister Becky, she
[19:27] has a song
[19:49] When I come to [singing]
[19:52] the river
[19:55] at the end
[19:58] of day [singing]
[20:00] when the last wind
[20:04] of sorrow
[20:06] blown.
[20:14] waiting
[20:17] to show me the way.
[20:22] I won't have to cross Jordan
[20:28] alone.
[20:32] [music] I won't have to
[20:36] cross Jordan
[20:39] alone
[20:44] because Jesus [music and singing] died
[20:47] all my
[21:00] he'll be [singing] waiting.
[21:03] for me.
[21:06] I won't have to cross
[21:12] alone.
[21:17] Often times I'm forsaken
[21:23] and we
[21:26] sad
[21:28] when it seems [music and singing]
[21:46] [singing] heartless.
[21:49] I won't have to cross [singing] Jordan
[21:55] alone.
[21:59] And though the billows
[22:02] of sorrow
[22:05] and trouble [singing] may sweep,
[22:10] Christ myavior,
[22:13] he cares for his
[22:21] [singing]
[22:24] journeys.
[22:26] Our [singing] souls he will keep and we
[22:31] won't have to cross Jordan
[22:36] alone.
[22:41] I won't have to cross Jordan
[22:46] alone.
[22:51] Jesus died
[22:54] all [singing] my sins to atone.
[23:02] In the darkness
[23:05] I see
[23:08] he is waiting
[23:11] for me.
[23:15] I won't
[23:18] cross Jordan.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[23:36] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[23:39] I could cross over right now.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; It's that real.
[23:47] Sister Anna would like to
[23:50] get up and say a little something
[23:53] to the church and [snorts]
[24:07] God bless you saints and thank you for
[24:09] coming. I really just have a lot of
[24:11] people to thank, but I want to thank God
[24:13] first for making her his daughter
[24:18] because I'm her daughter. [snorts]
[24:30] A little history on mom. She was 12 when
[24:33] the Lord started dealing with her.
[24:36] She was born Catholic into a Catholic
[24:38] family. And at 12, there was no earthly
[24:43] reason for a idol that she was praying
[24:45] to to turn and burn. It just caught
[24:49] fire. And she knew then the Lord was
[24:52] talking to her.
[24:54] And then she came back across into
[24:57] California
[24:59] and she became apostolic. And that was
[25:03] her understanding at the time.
[25:05] And there was a time where she knew
[25:07] because she would had been listening to
[25:10] messages about brother Brandham and she
[25:13] had been to a couple of his meetings and
[25:15] he prayed for her once and she was
[25:17] healed.
[25:19] And
[25:21] then we came to Phoenix for what we
[25:24] thought was the word
[25:26] and um
[25:28] supposedly brother Brandham's message
[25:30] but definitely no Holy Spirit there. Um,
[25:33] and then because of brother Pollock,
[25:36] Brother Dave, he invited us to my
[25:40] parents to brother Ron's church and they
[25:44] made it their home.
[25:46] And she finally made it home. And
[25:48] there's so many of you that she
[25:51] loved so deeply
[25:55] and so profoundly that she would
[25:57] [laughter] tell me, "Ana, we need to
[26:00] pray for these people who when she'd
[26:01] hear their testimonies as a little bit
[26:03] of admonishment, she'd say, listen to
[26:05] this because the Lord can do a work in
[26:07] you just like that or differently, but
[26:10] still do the work in you if you'll allow
[26:13] it."
[26:15] And so from the Catholicism to the
[26:18] apostolic and to
[26:21] her former church each time a higher
[26:24] ground
[26:26] &gt;&gt; and now she's reached her summit and
[26:29] she's home.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. [gasps]
[26:32] &gt;&gt; And praise God for that.
[26:35] And she would get upset if brother one
[26:37] wasn't preaching. But then I'd say,
[26:38] "Hey, it's Brother Steven McNeely." And
[26:40] she Okay. Okay. I'm fine. [laughter]
[26:44] And then you know brothers Chua she
[26:47] loved brother Chua's preaching brother
[26:49] Canana brother love all [snorts]
[26:52] she just loved it and then brother
[26:54] Arazola came on and she's like oh I
[26:56] really like him [laughter]
[26:59] and she just had her way about that but
[27:03] through all of her ups and downs with
[27:05] her health all of your prayers is what
[27:08] got us through and we so thank you for
[27:10] that. We cannot
[27:12] even express to the degree that we are
[27:15] so grateful because it takes all of us.
[27:17] It takes all of you to be the church
[27:21] that you are and to help us through to
[27:24] the other side.
[27:26] And I I I
[27:29] just can't even express
[27:31] the love that I feel for you because
[27:33] through her telling me about your
[27:35] testimonies and telling me who you were
[27:38] and she'd even on when we had to watch
[27:40] my screen, she's like, "Oh, there's
[27:41] there's my brother. There's my sister
[27:43] and oh, you remember her and oh,
[27:45] remember we need to pray for that one."
[27:46] And and so [laughter] she she would just
[27:50] be glad that she could participate that
[27:53] way, but always including me about
[27:55] what needed to be done and said for
[27:58] people. And [snorts] so I just
[28:02] thank you and to brother one who has
[28:05] been so steadfast and diligent in the
[28:07] care and pastoring of her and Sister
[28:10] Sandy by his side ever steadfast too.
[28:15] And when I got baptized I'll never
[28:16] forget this. And Sister Judy Dilling, if
[28:19] you're hearing this and you're watching
[28:20] this, mother used to tell me, "Sister
[28:23] Judy Dilling really knows how to hug
[28:25] people." [laughter]
[28:27] But when I got baptized, Sister Sandy
[28:29] gave me such a big hug. And I said, "Ah,
[28:31] Sister Judy, you're on notice."
[28:32] [laughter]
[28:34] So, I just wanted to thank you all for
[28:36] coming. Thank you all for your prayers,
[28:39] for visiting, for your texts, for your
[28:40] cards and gifts, and just for loving my
[28:43] mama. I miss her, but I know that she's
[28:46] rejoicing right now and she sees us all.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you once again, and God bless you
[28:51] all for being here.
[29:02] Okay. So, at this time too, if anybody
[29:05] [snorts] has any
[29:07] testimony or something, come forward.
[29:21] God bless everybody. [clears throat]
[29:25] Not everybody might know me personally,
[29:28] but I was um [clears throat]
[29:36] she was my aunt Mary.
[29:38] She is my father's oldest sister
[29:44] and I have
[29:47] known her all my life.
[29:50] Um
[29:52] she was a very special to me. She was my
[29:55] favorite aunt.
[29:57] Um,
[29:59] my father was one that didn't really
[30:02] consider, you know, birthdays and, you
[30:05] know, he didn't really, but when my aunt
[30:08] Mary found out it was somebody's
[30:10] birthday, boy, she had to, you know, it
[30:12] didn't matter how big her family was,
[30:14] she always remembered and she made a
[30:16] special uh, day for us. And that's
[30:20] something I do appreciate because I can
[30:21] remember, you know, when you're a child
[30:23] and something happens, you can remember
[30:26] for the rest of your life, you know. Um,
[30:30] and that's something that that I will
[30:31] always
[30:34] carry
[30:35] in my heart.
[30:41] Um my father came to the message came to
[30:45] believe the message
[30:47] through you know like my cousin Anna had
[30:52] mentioned uh
[30:54] she uh she had gone to listen to the
[30:57] message or or you know attend
[31:00] uh brother Brandham's meetings and my
[31:03] father came to
[31:06] uh believe the message at at that time.
[31:10] Uh he kind of like
[31:14] kind of got off the track there for a
[31:16] bit, but
[31:19] uh
[31:21] God is merciful.
[31:23] And uh I uh
[31:27] and the church like she said um when
[31:31] when she just before she came to be part
[31:35] of this congregation uh at the old uh
[31:39] building.
[31:41] Uh
[31:42] she kind they were kind of waiting for
[31:44] me cuz me and my wife got married and
[31:47] they were waiting for that to kind of
[31:51] uh
[31:52] realize itself, you know, happen and
[31:55] then they were going to move on and you
[31:58] know she had been invited to the congre
[32:01] but she and then after that actually a
[32:03] few years later I actually began to
[32:05] attend at the old uh building. Uh so I
[32:10] know some of you do remember me. It's
[32:12] been a while, but um uh I really
[32:16] appreciate
[32:17] uh the care that everybody shared with
[32:20] her
[32:22] and uh it it is very dear to my heart
[32:25] because uh
[32:28] even though I know I know she was my
[32:29] family but now I consider you guys my
[32:32] family. So uh God bless you all.
[32:44] Is anybody feel on their heart to
[32:53] Yeah.
[32:55] Jerry
[33:24] God bless you. God bless you, Sister
[33:27] Hannah. I don't have a lot of big
[33:30] swelling words to say, but I just want
[33:33] to tell you that your mother was a very
[33:35] special person to Sister Gwen and I. She
[33:38] always had that smile that when we shook
[33:41] her hand and I didn't know you guys very
[33:44] well, but I remember your dad and we
[33:48] talked about your father quite often. We
[33:50] talked about him, what a special little
[33:53] man he was. And he just meant meant so
[33:56] much to us and I remember just having
[33:59] personal conversations with him and
[34:02] telling me where he was from and where
[34:04] he grew up and things like that. But
[34:09] I I remember we me and brother Creed
[34:12] came over and painted your house and she
[34:15] cooked us a big old lunch of Mexican
[34:19] food and she just tried to show us how
[34:21] thankful she was
[34:24] and
[34:26] we're going to miss your mother.
[34:29] But when
[34:32] all of us have to go one time or
[34:35] another, but I I keep all these and I
[34:38] put them up in my little office and I'm
[34:40] going to remember this picture because
[34:42] this is the one I'm going to when I see
[34:44] her again. It's what I'm going to
[34:47] recognize her. And we just love you and
[34:50] this we're praying for you. God bless
[34:53] you.
[35:06] Okay. Well,
[35:08] I'll just say a little just a little
[35:10] something else with Sister Mary. You
[35:12] know,
[35:14] she uh you know, after brother the Rudy
[35:17] was gone and then she used to drive
[35:19] herself, come with that little Corolla,
[35:24] pull into the handicap spot, you know,
[35:26] and everything, get out. You just either
[35:29] go help her or then when it's time to
[35:31] leave, you know, here she is trying to
[35:33] back out and we'd be clearing out for
[35:34] her. Come on back. Come on back. Brother
[35:36] John's probably done it a few times for,
[35:39] you know, it's one of those, you know,
[35:42] and then uh then a little bit later, you
[35:45] know, Sister Anna was telling me how
[35:47] they had to take her keys and oh my
[35:51] goodness, you know, [laughter]
[35:54] but you know, Sister Anna started
[35:56] bringing her drop her off and she'd
[35:58] leave. And sister Anna said her mama
[36:01] used to go home and tell her
[36:04] about the people. And
[36:07] Anna, she kept watching. She kept
[36:09] watching.
[36:12] And it was the love of Christ that got
[36:14] your that caught you. [snorts] And next
[36:17] thing you know, Anna comes in.
[36:22] And you know, I I want to give a rose to
[36:24] Anna, what she's done for the last
[36:28] 20 years,
[36:30] whatever it's been
[36:32] to take care of your mama and daddy.
[36:35] [snorts]
[36:36] My goodness. And you know, God don't
[36:39] miss a beat. He knew exactly the right
[36:42] person
[36:43] that could do it.
[36:46] And it was you. a nurse was able to keep
[36:50] her certifications,
[36:52] everything. You can't
[36:55] you can't outplan God.
[36:57] That's a fact. And we know that. And so
[37:01] I honor you, Sister Anna, for your love,
[37:04] sacrifice of love, not for your mama,
[37:08] but for a daughter of God.
[37:12] What a blessing.
[37:14] You think about it, right?
[37:16] My goodness.
[37:19] All heaven's all heaven's for us.
[37:23] Like I always like to say after I heard
[37:25] a minister say, "We're not fighting to
[37:28] victory. We're fighting from victory
[37:31] because that's where we're going."
[37:35] Um, so we got a a little lunchon
[37:38] planned. Hope everybody could stay. If
[37:41] you can't, that's fine.
[37:43] But uh you know, sister Mary, she
[37:46] wouldn't, man, she'd never forgive us if
[37:48] we didn't feed the people.
[37:51] She's one time she she brought tamalies.
[37:54] Now, I don't know if she gave any other
[37:56] deacons, but she gave me some time.
[37:58] [laughter]
[38:00] But, you know, just in her little ways,
[38:02] just But you think back and you're like
[38:07] her heart's desire was to cook a whole
[38:10] meal for everybody.
[38:12] That's just the kind of person she was.
[38:16] And we're going to miss
[38:25] [snorts] Oh, excuse me.
[38:29] The last time I saw her
[38:33] [snorts]
[38:37] at her house here a month or so ago
[38:42] [snorts] and I come in and Anna was
[38:44] there with her and
[38:47] she was at her feet or whatever. She got
[38:49] up and so I could sit in the chair and I
[38:52] went sat down
[38:59] and I said, "Where you?" She goes, "I
[39:01] always just rubbing mama's feet.
[39:06] I don't realize."
[39:08] So I sat there for just a little bit
[39:11] just
[39:13] rubbing her feet for her,
[39:23] you know, and she wasn't really
[39:26] coherent.
[39:28] [snorts]
[39:29] And all of a sudden she
[39:32] [sighs]
[39:33] she looked at me. I said, "Is this
[39:35] Mary?" [laughter]
[39:36] She almost scared me. She looked at me
[39:39] and I was like, "Okay." You know, so I
[39:41] was just talking with her,
[39:45] you know, I was just, "Man, you just
[39:48] don't I'll [snorts] cherish that
[39:54] when I had time to go, you know, I just
[39:57] I said [snorts] gave her a kiss on the
[40:00] forehead, you know, and you're just,
[40:03] man, you don't realize. We were hoping
[40:05] she'd make it to her 95th birthday.
[40:08] That was and you know that was her hop
[40:11] and they had this big you know what
[40:15] she wouldn't change it for the world
[40:16] sister Anna she would she got her
[40:20] present
[40:22] man and we're thankful.
[40:25] Okay let's bow our heads. [snorts]
[40:28] Father, as we
[40:31] pause now, Lord, and close at this time,
[40:33] Lord, we thank you for once [snorts]
[40:35] again, Lord, a life that was lived
[40:37] before us
[40:41] that without a shadow of a doubt,
[40:45] we will see her again.
[40:47] [snorts]
[40:48] Father, I pray you continue to
[40:52] give Anna wisdom, Lord.
[40:55] [snorts] Give her understanding, Lord,
[40:57] and revelation, Father, what to do next
[41:00] and to carry on, Father, realizing,
[41:04] Lord, that
[41:09] we are her family, your chosen people.
[41:13] [snorts]
[41:14] Father, we just ask now, Lord, that you
[41:16] just
[41:18] be with her, Lord, and the family, oh
[41:20] God.
[41:22] Father, we just commit this time into
[41:24] your hands, Lord, and everything that
[41:26] was said and done and sung, Father. We
[41:29] [snorts] ask you to bless the food
[41:31] that's been prepared, Father. The hands
[41:32] that that made it, Father, and we just
[41:36] commit this time into your hands, Lord.
[41:38] We love you in Jesus Christ's name.
[41:42] Amen.
