[18:12] Steven McNeely, will you come pray this
[18:14] morning? Sister
[18:15] Peace, one of our faithful translators
[18:18] here, says this morning, I developed a
[18:20] sensitivity to sound in my left ear
[18:22] whenever I was using the headsets about
[18:24] a year ago. Uh, this would affect me
[18:27] while I was translating or using them in
[18:29] general to the point that I would have
[18:31] to uh turn it on the lowest volume
[18:34] possible to avoid the pain. I was
[18:36] worried about this for the meetings, but
[18:39] I thank God that he hears our very
[18:42] thoughts, too. I had some horrible
[18:45] burning pain Friday at work while using
[18:48] headsets, but to my surprise, I have not
[18:51] felt any pain translating in all of the
[18:54] post meet these meetings. And I find
[18:57] that truly amazing. Amen. We give the
[19:01] Lord praise this morning. He hears and
[19:04] he answers our need. If you got a need
[19:07] this morning, you pray with Brother
[19:09] Steven as he leads us in prayer. If you
[19:10] got a need, lift your need today.
[19:12] Brother Steven will lead us in prayer
[19:13] today. He knows our hearts. The Lord,
[19:15] let's bow our heads together. Heavenly
[19:17] Father, what an honor and a privilege it
[19:18] is that we can be called the sons and
[19:21] daughters of God. That we can gather
[19:23] together, Lord, at a a congregation with
[19:26] with in this size, Lord, bringing our
[19:29] licks of fire together, Lord, Father,
[19:31] for a purpose that we might hear from
[19:34] you, Lord. You can feel the expectation,
[19:37] Father, in the atmosphere. And so, we're
[19:40] expecting, Lord, and for you to come by
[19:42] and to speak to hearts. And I ask,
[19:44] Father, that you would break the bread
[19:46] of life to us. That you would multiply
[19:48] the fish and the loaves, Lord. That you
[19:50] would open the heart, Lord, of our
[19:53] understanding, Father God, that we may
[19:55] not only hear from you, but receive of
[19:57] your word and understand it in our
[19:59] hearts. Father, I ask now a special
[20:02] blessing upon our brother Chad as he
[20:04] would come and lay his gift down at the
[20:06] altar. We ask you would anoint him and
[20:08] inspire him and use the gift mightily,
[20:11] Lord, for thy kingdom's glory and
[20:13] everything else that is said and done,
[20:15] Lord. We ask that it would be done and
[20:18] in uh to honor you and to bring glory to
[20:21] your name. Father, many uh requests upon
[20:24] the hearts of your people perhaps that
[20:26] have not been written down. We ask that
[20:28] you would move because you are the God
[20:31] that hears and answers prayer whether
[20:35] it's spoken, whether it's unspoken,
[20:38] whether it's within the hearts of your
[20:40] people because that's what you do, Lord.
[20:42] Father, we are excited and we are just
[20:45] so uh uh expecting a great moving of
[20:49] your spirit. We love you now and we
[20:50] commit all things into your hands for
[20:52] thy kingdom's glory in Jesus name. Amen.
[20:55] Amen. Why don't you shake your
[20:57] neighbor's hand, someone beside you,
[20:58] behind you, in front of you, and tell
[21:00] them God bless you and want to welcome
[21:02] all our guests and our visitors. Want to
[21:04] welcome our streamers today. Most of
[21:06] all, we welcome the
[21:08] Lord. Oh, I want to see him. Look upon
[21:11] his face. Brother Moses, if you get
[21:12] ready to sing, Moses, if you get ready
[21:14] to sing after we sing this. Oh, I want
[21:16] to see him and look upon his face. As I
[21:19] journey through the land, singing as I
[21:23] go, point angles to
[21:26] Calvary.

[21:50] streets of glory. Let me lift my
[21:54] voice. I'll hold that ever to
[21:59] rejoice when in service for my Lord.
[22:02] Dark may be the night, but I'll cling
[22:06] for close to him. He does give me light.
[22:10] Satan snares me breaks my soul. Turn my
[22:13] thoughts aside. Oh, but my Lord looks
[22:17] ahead and leads what every
[22:19] time. Oh, I want to see him look upon
[22:24] his face there to sing for it of his
[22:28] saving grace and on the streets of
[22:32] glory. Let me lift my voice here on that
[22:38] ever to rejoice. And when it valleys
[22:42] low, I look toward the mountain
[22:45] high. And behold, my savior there he's
[22:48] leading in the mine. And with a tender
[22:52] hand I'll stretch toward the valley low.
[22:55] This is what he's doing. Guiding me. I
[22:57] can see as I onward go.
[23:02] Hallelujah. Him. Look upon his face.

[23:29] does
[23:31] safely. And he leads me gently on

[42:21] fed the word of God and give brother
[42:23] Chad your undivided attention and you'll
[42:26] go home blessed. I truly believe it. I'm
[42:28] not my own. I belong to Jesus as brother
[42:30] Chad comes this morning. I'm not my own.
[42:33] Amen. I am redeemed. Bought with a
[42:36] price. Don't know that one. I am
[42:40] [Music]
[42:42] redeemed with a
[42:46] pride. Oh
[42:48] Jesus, he has changed my whole life.
[42:56] If
[42:57] anybody be as
[43:00] you
[43:02] just
[43:03] I just tell them that
[43:09] I is that your testimony. If it is, lift
[43:12] your hand and
[43:13] [Music]
[43:14] [Applause]
[43:16] sing. God bless you today.
[43:20] [Music]
[43:24] Jesus, he has changed my whole life.
[43:32] [Music]
[43:42] Tell them that I am redeemed.
[43:49] [Music]
[43:50] Amen. Praise God.
[43:53] Oh, it's so good to know that we're
[43:55] redeemed.
[43:57] Praise God. Just want to say we love you
[44:00] all so very much. We've enjoyed
[44:02] ourselves. Uh really enjoyed ourselves.
[44:06] Enjoyed the
[44:07] atmosphere. Appreciate Brother Ron for
[44:10] the invitation. I feel like it's a
[44:12] privilege just to be here this weekend
[44:15] and I uh so enjoy your hospitality and
[44:18] your welcoming spirit and your pull on
[44:19] the word. It's made such a difference
[44:22] for me. It's been quite a blessing. So,
[44:24] I'd like to just start with bowing our
[44:26] heads and thanking the
[44:27] Lord. Dear heavenly father, we thank you
[44:30] so much, Lord, for you've been so good
[44:32] to
[44:33] us. God, every time that we can gather
[44:36] like this, Lord, it's a privilege.
[44:39] May we never take it for granted. May it
[44:41] never become common place to us. But
[44:44] every time you gather your children
[44:46] together, Lord, may it be a special
[44:48] time. And may we come with great
[44:50] expectation, Lord, to hear from you. For
[44:52] you have not gathered us in vain. That
[44:54] you don't just keep traditions, Lord,
[44:56] for tradition's sake. But you've
[44:58] gathered us to speak to us, Lord. And
[45:01] God, we're hungry for more of your word.
[45:03] We're hungry to hear from you. We want,
[45:06] Lord, more. We want all that you have
[45:08] for us. I pray God as we come to you,
[45:11] would you come and feed your sheep,
[45:13] Lord? Would you use this vessel of clay
[45:16] as I surrender myself to you? May you
[45:19] take full control. May you have
[45:20] preeminence and may you take your
[45:22] liberty to speak as you wish to move me
[45:25] any direction you want, Lord. May you
[45:28] come and meet needs and speak your word
[45:30] in a way, Lord, that will open our eyes.
[45:33] May you take the Isav and rub it in our
[45:35] eyes, Lord, that we might see more than
[45:37] we've ever seen before. May recognize
[45:40] our day and its message and our place in
[45:43] this word. And may God, you accomplish
[45:46] what you intended to accomplish today.
[45:48] May it be done. May there be nothing
[45:50] that would hinder you in any way. May we
[45:52] surrender it all to you now. We love you
[45:55] and ask your blessings upon your people.
[45:57] In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[46:01] Amen. Then before we're seated, if we
[46:03] could just take our Bibles and turn to
[46:05] the book of
[46:08] Revelation and turn to Revelation
[46:10] chapter
[46:13] 5. Just want to say how much I enjoyed
[46:15] the service last night and I and I feel
[46:18] like for me the two services that
[46:21] brother Jason had ministered were for me
[46:23] personally and they blessed me in such a
[46:26] great way. some things that I really
[46:27] needed to hear, needed to be reminded
[46:30] of, and encouraged in. And so, I'm going
[46:32] home uh encouraged and blessed. And so,
[46:35] I'm thankful for that. Um, Brother
[46:37] Jason's always been a brother that I
[46:39] admired very much. When I was first in
[46:42] the message, when I first came to the
[46:44] truth, he was a minister that I listened
[46:45] to quite a bit. He was very much tied
[46:48] into our church at that time, helping in
[46:50] the missions work in Russia with brother
[46:51] Lonnie. So, we got quite familiar and
[46:53] quite acquainted with him. and he
[46:55] doesn't remember me then because I just
[46:57] showed up to the church and I didn't but
[46:59] I remember him very vividly and the
[47:02] impact that he had on me and so it's
[47:04] been a pleasure to be here with him in
[47:06] these meetings and so let's just turn
[47:09] our attention now to the word
[47:13] uh Revelation 5 verse
[47:16] one and I saw on the right hand of him
[47:19] that sat on the throne a book written
[47:22] within and on the backside side sealed
[47:25] with seven seals. And I saw a strong
[47:27] angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who
[47:29] is worthy to open the book, and to loose
[47:32] the seals thereof. And no man in heaven,
[47:36] nor in earth, neither under the earth,
[47:38] was able to open the book, neither to
[47:40] look thereon. And I wept much, because
[47:43] no man was found worthy to open and to
[47:45] read the book, neither to look thereon.
[47:48] And one of the elders said unto me,
[47:50] "Weep not, behold, the lion of the tribe
[47:52] of Judah, the root of David, hath
[47:54] prevailed to open the book, and to loose
[47:57] the seven seals thereof." And I beheld,
[48:00] and lo, in the midst of the throne, and
[48:01] of the four beasts, and in the midst of
[48:03] the elders stood a lamb, as it had been
[48:05] slain, having seven horns, and seven
[48:07] eyes, which are the seven spirits of
[48:09] God, sent forth unto all the earth. And
[48:12] he came and took the book out of the
[48:14] right hand of him that sat upon the
[48:16] throne. Amen. Amen. May the Lord add his
[48:19] blessing as we read. May you can have
[48:21] your seats. Amen.
[48:25] Praise the Lord.
[48:28] Amen. I'd like to take for a subject
[48:30] this morning, Lord willing, who is
[48:33] worthy to take the book. And brother M
[48:36] says much about this. And as we just
[48:38] read, God bless you, Sister Diane Dean
[48:40] Hart. It's so good to see you here. So
[48:42] thankful for that praise report. Amen.
[48:46] When we look at these uh uh look at the
[48:49] scripture here, we find that there was a
[48:51] book sealed with seven seals written on
[48:54] the inside and the outside sealed with
[48:55] seven seals. And it was being held by
[48:58] the original owner, the originator of
[49:00] the book. Amen. Which was God himself.
[49:03] And we know how he got the book, why
[49:05] he's holding the book, because Adam lost
[49:07] the book. And he lost the book of
[49:10] redemption. He lost the title deed, the
[49:12] the right to the inheritance of all of
[49:14] creation. and all of the earth, the
[49:16] right to rule and eternal life and all
[49:18] the things that are wrapped up in this.
[49:20] He had lost it and it couldn't go to
[49:22] Satan's dirty hands. So, it went back to
[49:25] the originator. Amen. But really, God
[49:28] did not want to hold this book.
[49:31] God didn't want this book. If God wanted
[49:34] the book, he wouldn't have given it to
[49:35] Adam in the first place. Amen. So, God's
[49:39] not the one who wanted to hold the book.
[49:41] The book wasn't for God. Amen. The book
[49:44] was the inheritance of God. The book was
[49:46] the family of God. The book was the
[49:49] purpose of God. The book was the mind of
[49:51] God. The book was God. It declared that
[49:54] God wanted to be made flesh, tangible,
[49:57] his attributes flesh as a family of God
[49:59] upon the earth in fellowship. And he
[50:01] gave that book to Adam so that Adam
[50:04] could make what was in the book manifest
[50:07] upon the earth. Amen.
[50:09] And before he could come to bring the
[50:11] manifestation of the contents of the
[50:13] book and the manifestation on the earth,
[50:15] he had fallen. And so now he lost the
[50:18] right to that book. And that book had to
[50:20] go back to the originator. And he's
[50:22] holding it. And remember, he gave that
[50:25] book to man.
[50:28] Amen. And so now he's holding the book
[50:31] waiting for another man who can take the
[50:33] book. Hallelujah. Cuz the book is is was
[50:36] given to man and he has to have a man
[50:39] who can take back the book because God
[50:41] doesn't want to hold this book. He wants
[50:43] to give it to man.
[50:47] That's why it says in verse two, "And I
[50:50] saw a strong angel proclaim with a loud
[50:52] voice, who is worthy to open the book
[50:55] and to loose the seals thereof." Now the
[50:57] question is worthiness. Who is worthy?
[50:59] And and brother Bam said there was
[51:01] angels there who had never sinned. There
[51:03] was cherubam and saraphims and there was
[51:05] the whole heavenly host. Amen. But it it
[51:07] wasn't for them. It had to be a man. It
[51:10] had to be a kinsman redeemer. It had to
[51:12] be uh someone who had come in like flesh
[51:15] who was able to take the book and who
[51:16] was worthy. Amen. And so the cry went
[51:19] out for the worthy one.
[51:22] Amen. And it
[51:24] said, "And no man in heaven, nor in
[51:28] earth, neither under the earth was able
[51:32] to open the book, neither to look
[51:35] thereon." And I wept much because no man
[51:39] was found worthy to open and to read the
[51:41] book, neither to look
[51:44] thereon. Amen. So, brother Bam says in
[51:46] the breach he says so it took a human
[51:49] kinsman and he asked for it and he
[51:52] wasn't found nowhere there's nobody no
[51:54] bishop no archbishop no priest no
[51:56] hierarchy no nothing was even that
[51:59] didn't even have the holiness enough to
[52:01] even look at the book
[52:05] my that's pretty strong but that's what
[52:07] the Bible said friend I'm just quoting
[52:09] what John said he said no man was able
[52:13] uh not just to take the book and to
[52:15] loose the seals. But no man was even
[52:17] able to look at the book.
[52:21] Nobody look at the contents because it
[52:23] was sealed up in the mind of God. It was
[52:25] God's original mystery plan. And so no
[52:28] man was worthy. And John wept much. And
[52:30] brother Bam said he wept because he knew
[52:32] that all creation is lost. If there's
[52:34] not a man that can take back the right
[52:36] to rule creation, to be God over the
[52:39] creation, if there's no man that comes
[52:41] forth, all of creation is lost. Amen. So
[52:44] he's crying and weeping. Amen. Cuz
[52:46] because he we we need a redeemer. We
[52:48] have to have a redeemer. There must be a
[52:50] man. There's got to be somebody that can
[52:52] take back what we've lost.
[52:55] And he's weeping. And finally, one of
[52:57] the elders. Amen. And I love what what
[52:59] what uh brother Jason said last night.
[53:02] And he was one of those elders. That's
[53:04] right. One of those 24 elders.
[53:07] Amen. Said, "Come weep not, John,
[53:09] because there is one who has prevailed.
[53:12] There is one who's able to take the book
[53:15] and to loose the seven seals thereof.
[53:18] Amen. And he looked to see a lion
[53:20] because it was called for a lion and he
[53:22] saw a lamb. Amen. So, we're all up to
[53:26] speed.
[53:33] Amen. So then, Brother Bam says, "Then
[53:37] we see rejoicing and pandemonium break
[53:40] out in heaven. Because all of heaven was
[53:43] waiting for this moment too. All of
[53:46] heaven was waiting for the man that can
[53:48] come forward and take back, amen, what
[53:50] was redeemed to claim, Amen. to take the
[53:53] claim of the inheritance that Adam lost.
[53:56] And here comes the man and everybody was
[53:58] rejoicing and all heavens broke out in
[54:01] praise. But then we come down to verse
[54:03] 13. And in verse 13 it says, "And every
[54:06] creature which was in heaven and on
[54:08] earth and under the earth, and as such
[54:10] as are in the sea, and all that are in
[54:12] them heard I saying, blessing and honor,
[54:15] and glory, and power be unto him that
[54:18] siteth upon the throne, and unto the
[54:20] Lamb forever and ever." Amen. Something
[54:23] happened that changed John from weeping
[54:26] to rejoicing. Amen. He was weeping
[54:28] because all is lost. He was weeping
[54:30] because there was nobody found. Amen.
[54:32] Moses wasn't worthy. Amen. David wasn't
[54:35] worthy. There was no man that was
[54:36] worthy. And he was weeping cuz all
[54:38] creation is lost. But now the lamb comes
[54:41] and takes the book to open the seals.
[54:43] And he begins rejoicing and says
[54:46] everybody, all heaven, all earth,
[54:48] everything under the earth heard me
[54:50] shouting praises and glory and worthy is
[54:53] the lamb forever and ever. Amen. And we
[54:56] know brother BM tells us that John is
[54:58] typing the bride. One man in the vision
[55:00] can type the entire church. And he's
[55:02] screaming. That's all of us, friends,
[55:04] because there was a lamb that could take
[55:06] the book.
[55:08] Amen. And this is the age that he took
[55:10] the book. Amen. And this is our
[55:12] rejoicing that redemption claims are
[55:14] met. There's somebody that can take the
[55:16] inheritance. And now he's come forth to
[55:19] make a claim. That's it. That's right.
[55:21] And we're part of that claim. He's
[55:23] claiming us. He's claiming everything
[55:25] that was lost because we were lost. When
[55:28] the book was bound up, we were bound up
[55:30] with the book. But now we've been
[55:31] loosed.
[55:32] [Applause]
[55:35] praise be to God.
[55:39] Oh,
[55:41] here's how Brother Brem says it in the
[55:43] third seal. I think it's marvelous. The
[55:46] the prophetic insight absolutely stuns
[55:48] me sometimes.
[55:50] He says, "John said everybody in heaven,
[55:52] everything beneath the earth, everything
[55:54] heard him praising God about it. John
[55:57] must have found his name on there."
[55:59] Amen. Yes, sir. Hey, listen. This is
[56:03] We're still in chapter 5. We're not in
[56:05] chapter six where the lamb peels back
[56:06] the seal. Something happened to John
[56:09] that he knew his name was part of that
[56:12] book. He knew he was bound up in that
[56:15] sealed book. And when the redeemer came
[56:17] forth to claim the book, he was free. He
[56:21] was claimed. He was restored.
[56:25] And how did he
[56:28] how did he find his name on there?
[56:31] That's it.
[56:33] Come on.
[56:35] Hey, listen. He didn't find it by
[56:36] reading. That's right.
[56:39] That's right. He didn't find it by
[56:41] reading, friends. He found it by
[56:44] revelation. He knew by revelation that
[56:47] he was part of that. And when the lamb
[56:49] was stepped forward and took the book,
[56:51] he was now rejoicing. Amen. Rejoicing.
[56:54] Because he wasn't yet reading. He knew
[56:56] his name was in that book. That's it.
[56:59] Listen, you're not going to discover
[57:00] your name in that book by reading.
[57:02] That's right. It's going to be by
[57:04] revelation.
[57:06] Amen.
[57:08] Amen. And we know now that we we come
[57:11] and we're just skipping so many things,
[57:13] friends, but we're going to go to
[57:14] Revelation
[57:16] 10:7. Revelation 10:7
[57:19] now. And he
[57:22] says in Revelation 10 uh not 7 10:1 and
[57:26] I saw another mighty angel come down
[57:28] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[57:29] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[57:31] was it were the sun and his feet as
[57:34] pillars of fire. Brother Venom said none
[57:36] other than Christ it could be. So this
[57:38] is Jesus Christ returning. Amen. Coming
[57:41] back to claim dominion. Amen. Putting
[57:44] everything under his feet. Everything on
[57:46] earth and everything in the sea is now
[57:48] under his dominion because he's got the
[57:50] book.
[57:52] Amen. The right to rule all of creation.
[57:56] And he comes with an open book in his
[57:58] hand. Brother Brandham said the same
[58:00] book that was closed in Revelation
[58:02] chapter 5 is now open in the hand of the
[58:04] mighty angel which is Christ.
[58:07] So he's bringing the book back to the
[58:10] earth. Amen. Amen.
[58:14] That's right. Oh, I love these things.
[58:17] I love them so much. They're so real in
[58:20] my heart. They mean so much to me that
[58:22] I'm about to burst. And then when I go
[58:24] to say something, there's nothing to
[58:25] say.
[58:27] What words can express what goes on
[58:29] inside? What human language can actually
[58:32] take the feeling that's going on inside
[58:34] of us and be able to explain it. You
[58:37] say, "I'm about to bust." What is it
[58:38] over? What are you about to bust?
[58:40] Because the book's open. Hallelujah.
[58:43] Hallelujah. Yes. It's somebody who
[58:46] hasn't seen their name in the book and
[58:48] doesn't know what redemption is all
[58:49] about. Doesn't know how they were bound
[58:51] up and locked down under those seals.
[58:54] Amen. They don't know what it means that
[58:55] the book is open and the mighty angels
[58:58] descended and he's brought the closed
[59:00] book that was separated from man. He's
[59:02] brought it back to earth as an open book
[59:06] in our day. Amen. And you get you get so
[59:09] overjoyed and you try to describe it.
[59:11] And and this is why brother Brandham
[59:13] said, "I just feel like speaking in
[59:14] tongues. I don't have language enough."
[59:17] That's the truth. Amen. There was times
[59:19] I'm walking in my hotel this morning,
[59:21] pacing the floor, and I'm thinking
[59:23] there's something's welling up, another
[59:25] language in me. I'm about to pop. I
[59:27] don't know what to say. There's nothing
[59:29] I can say to express this.
[59:34] Lord, you just feel like speaking in
[59:35] tongues
[59:37] in a heavenly language.
[59:43] What are you so excited about? The
[59:45] mighty angel descended with an open book
[59:47] in his hand. That's right.
[59:50] That's right. What are you shouting
[59:52] about, John the Lamb took the book?
[59:54] Because I saw my name in that book. How
[59:57] did you see it? What eyes did you use?
[59:59] It wasn't these eyes, friends. There was
[1:00:01] another set of eyes John saw his name on
[1:00:04] that book with.
[1:00:06] [Music]
[1:00:08] And he comes down
[1:00:11] Amen. And we know he he he declares that
[1:00:15] time shall be no more and seven thunders
[1:00:18] utter their voice. John was about to
[1:00:20] ride. He was told not to write it. And
[1:00:22] then we're told in the days uh and the
[1:00:25] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:00:28] begin to sound the mystery of God.
[1:00:29] That's it. That was the mystery that was
[1:00:31] locked in this book. The mystery of God
[1:00:33] should be finished as he had declared to
[1:00:35] his servants to prophets. Amen. Amen. So
[1:00:39] this was just our introduction.
[1:00:43] Now the subject is who is worthy to take
[1:00:45] the book
[1:00:47] because no man in heaven, no man on
[1:00:51] earth, no man under the earth was able
[1:00:54] to take the book to loose the seals or
[1:00:58] even to look at the book.
[1:01:02] Talk about a special book.
[1:01:04] Amen. But now when the mighty angel
[1:01:06] comes and brings the book back to earth,
[1:01:09] we go to verse
[1:01:11] 8. And the voice which I heard from
[1:01:13] heaven spake unto me again and said, "Go
[1:01:15] and take the little book
[1:01:17] which is open in the hand of the angel
[1:01:19] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:01:21] earth."
[1:01:27] What are you talking about?
[1:01:29] Nobody's allowed to touch this book.
[1:01:32] Yeah, nobody's allowed to look at this
[1:01:36] book.
[1:01:37] Nobody's worthy to touch it. Nobody can
[1:01:41] loose the seals of it. Nobody can even
[1:01:44] look at it. And now a voice from heaven
[1:01:48] says, "Go to the mighty angel." That's
[1:01:51] right.
[1:01:55] Amen.
[1:01:57] Go and take the little book which is
[1:02:01] open in the hand of the angel which
[1:02:04] standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:02:07] earth. The angel that has full dominion
[1:02:10] again. Go to that angel and take the
[1:02:13] book.
[1:02:17] Something happened, friends.
[1:02:20] Something's happened between Revelation
[1:02:22] 5 and Revelation chapter 10. Something
[1:02:25] drastic has changed concerning this book
[1:02:28] because nobody could touch it, look at
[1:02:30] it, nobody could look on it, nobody
[1:02:32] could read it, nobody could do any, no
[1:02:34] man could do anything. But now that the
[1:02:36] worthy one has come and taken and loosed
[1:02:38] the seals and brought the open book
[1:02:40] back. Now the command is to go and take
[1:02:43] the book.
[1:02:45] Amen. And he says, "And I went into the
[1:02:48] angel." Brother Ben said, "This is
[1:02:50] Christ."
[1:02:52] And I went into the angel and I said
[1:02:53] unto him, "Give me the little book."
[1:03:00] Amen. Think about it.
[1:03:03] He didn't say, "Please."
[1:03:07] [Music]
[1:03:10] My goodness. Look at the Bible language,
[1:03:12] friends. He didn't gravel. He didn't
[1:03:14] come on his knees, you know. He didn't
[1:03:16] do pentance. He didn't.
[1:03:20] He just did what the voice from heaven
[1:03:22] told him to do. He came to the mighty
[1:03:24] angel said, "Give me the book." There
[1:03:26] there was a cry from a strong angel
[1:03:28] said, "Who's worthy to come and take the
[1:03:30] book?" And John, you know, he's cowering
[1:03:32] down. He's not worthy to take the book.
[1:03:34] He can't do anything with this book. He
[1:03:35] can't look at this book. Amen. And he
[1:03:37] his heart's pounding hoping that
[1:03:38] somebody can come. He's weeping much cuz
[1:03:41] nobody's worthy. And all of a sudden, a
[1:03:42] cry comes out. Hey, don't weep. There's
[1:03:45] one worthy. and his turns to shouting,
[1:03:47] "Praise God, there's a worthy one." Cuz
[1:03:48] he knew he wasn't the worthy one. He
[1:03:50] knew there was nobody else worthy. Amen.
[1:03:52] But now all of a sudden, something has
[1:03:55] changed.
[1:03:56] And the voice says, "Go to the angel
[1:03:59] with the book in his hand and and and
[1:04:00] and take the little book." And he says,
[1:04:03] "Give me the book."
[1:04:08] And I love what the mighty angel says.
[1:04:12] Take
[1:04:13] it. Amen.
[1:04:18] [Applause]
[1:04:20] This book in this age is only for a
[1:04:22] certain category of people. This isn't
[1:04:24] for everybody. This didn't come to
[1:04:26] anybody. This is not Amen. for anybody
[1:04:29] that'll hear this. This was to John. A
[1:04:31] voice from heaven told John, "Go to the
[1:04:34] angel and take the book." And why did he
[1:04:36] have to go to the angel? Why didn't he
[1:04:37] go to the seventh church age messenger
[1:04:39] for the book? Exactly right. Amen.
[1:04:42] Because when brother Brandham got to the
[1:04:44] end of the of the seven seals, he says,
[1:04:47] "Now, now he says, now don't say thank
[1:04:49] you to any man." That's right. That's
[1:04:51] it. Don't say thank you to any man. He
[1:04:54] goes, "Nobody. I didn't have anything to
[1:04:56] do with this." He said, "I just went
[1:04:58] into the room." Amen. And he met me
[1:05:00] there every day. He says, "If he hadn't
[1:05:02] met me there, I would have made a
[1:05:03] horrible mistake today."
[1:05:05] He says, "I was looking through books
[1:05:07] and old notes that I had and other
[1:05:09] things people wrote and I got to where I
[1:05:10] think I had it figured out and all of a
[1:05:12] sudden he came on the scene and totally
[1:05:14] changed everything. And every day an
[1:05:16] angel met him in that room and gave him
[1:05:18] a vision. In the vision, he would just
[1:05:20] go to writing it down. Then he would
[1:05:21] spend the rest of the day running it
[1:05:23] through the scriptures and he would come
[1:05:24] back and bring it to the people. He
[1:05:26] says, "Don't say thank you to any man."
[1:05:29] No man had anything to do with this
[1:05:31] because it was the mighty angel that
[1:05:33] opened the book. Only the lamb can take
[1:05:36] the book and only the lamb can loose the
[1:05:38] seals. The seventh angel couldn't loose
[1:05:40] the seals. The seventh angel couldn't
[1:05:42] reveal the book. He was just given the
[1:05:44] information.
[1:05:48] And then he would come to the pit and
[1:05:49] tell you that's right what he was told.
[1:05:52] That's exactly right. So he said I can't
[1:05:55] take any credit for this.
[1:05:58] So now we we can't go to the seventh
[1:06:01] angel for the open book. We have to go
[1:06:03] to the mighty angel. The one who took
[1:06:06] it, the one who opened it, the one who
[1:06:08] revealed it. Thank you, Lord. Amen. We
[1:06:11] said this is for a certain category of
[1:06:13] people.
[1:06:15] He's sitting there holding an open book
[1:06:18] in his hand and the voice says, "Go take
[1:06:22] the book out of the hand.
[1:06:27] John comes up and says, "Give me the
[1:06:29] book." Amen. Amen. And the angel says,
[1:06:33] "Take it."
[1:06:39] Listen, God is not This is not a passive
[1:06:43] thing, friends. That's right. This is
[1:06:45] not for anybody. This is not just for uh
[1:06:49] lazy Christians, half-hearted people who
[1:06:52] just floating along and part of a group
[1:06:54] and coming along. This is for somebody
[1:06:56] who wants it more than anything. This is
[1:06:58] for somebody who's seen their name in
[1:06:59] the book. This is for somebody who knows
[1:07:01] what redemption's all about and craving
[1:07:03] craving craving the contents of that
[1:07:05] book. And he says, "Go take the book."
[1:07:07] And he says, "Give me the book." And he
[1:07:10] says, "Take it." He doesn't package it
[1:07:12] up and bring it down and hand it to him
[1:07:14] and say, "Point here and point." No. He
[1:07:16] says, "If you want it, come and get it.
[1:07:19] It's open. It's available. But come to
[1:07:21] me and take it out. Show me you're
[1:07:23] hungry. Show me you want it. Persevere.
[1:07:26] P on. Amen. God's not here playing. He
[1:07:29] doesn't play little simple games with
[1:07:31] the people. Hey, if you want it, come
[1:07:32] and get it. God has never had hot bed
[1:07:35] plans. He's never had to baby a sheep.
[1:07:36] He's looking for rugged Christians who
[1:07:38] want redemption, who want the truth, who
[1:07:41] want the word, who are willing to press,
[1:07:43] who will go to the mighty angel and say,
[1:07:45] "Give me the book. I got to have that
[1:07:48] book." And and God doesn't say, "Oh,
[1:07:50] that was so nice that you come to me
[1:07:51] like that. Let me come and
[1:07:56] Take it.
[1:07:59] Take jump higher. How bad do you want?
[1:08:07] This is for a special category of
[1:08:09] people.
[1:08:15] Take the
[1:08:17] book. Hallelujah.
[1:08:21] And he says, "And eat it up."
[1:08:28] What kind of book is this?
[1:08:33] What What kind of book is this that you
[1:08:37] can take and eat?
[1:08:41] Brother Venom shows us like it was in a
[1:08:42] form of a scroll. It was rolled up with
[1:08:45] a seal on it and another roll around it.
[1:08:47] And you peel it back over seven seals.
[1:08:49] Amen. And now there's an open book in
[1:08:51] his hand, an open scroll, however you
[1:08:53] want to picture it. But remember, the
[1:08:55] book of Revelation is a book of symbols.
[1:08:58] So this is a book. Don't go over there
[1:09:00] picture John going up to somebody taking
[1:09:03] paper scrolls out of his hand and
[1:09:05] chewing on paper. Listen, this is not
[1:09:07] what this is. This is the revelation of
[1:09:09] the truth, the mystery of God. And you
[1:09:11] can come and be part of this mystery,
[1:09:13] but you've got to consume it. You got to
[1:09:15] become one with it. You've got to ingest
[1:09:17] it. It's got to come inside of you. This
[1:09:20] isn't something you're going to hold in
[1:09:21] your hand. This isn't something you're
[1:09:22] going to read from. It's not something
[1:09:24] you're going to quote. This is something
[1:09:26] that's going to come inside of you and
[1:09:28] take over your life and change who you
[1:09:31] are. You're going to become what you
[1:09:33] eat.
[1:09:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:42] Now, I want to know what changed. Amen.
[1:09:46] John couldn't touch the thing.
[1:09:49] He couldn't even look upon it. Like
[1:09:55] and now he's eating it.
[1:10:01] Who is worthy to take this book?
[1:10:06] How did
[1:10:07] John become worthy? Yes. Not to take the
[1:10:11] book, not just to read the book, but how
[1:10:14] did he become worthy to eat the book?
[1:10:18] Beautiful.
[1:10:21] There's some good questions.
[1:10:24] And listen, I'll tell you friends, I
[1:10:25] don't know that I have all the answers.
[1:10:27] Well, I'm not I'm not I'm not saying I
[1:10:29] don't know. I know I don't have all the
[1:10:30] answers. That's the easier way to say
[1:10:32] it. There's so many things in this
[1:10:34] revelation that we still don't have a
[1:10:35] good handle on. But I tell you one
[1:10:37] thing, forgetting those things that are
[1:10:38] behind them, pressing forward in this
[1:10:40] revelation of this message. Amen. What
[1:10:43] caused the Ephesian age to fail, they
[1:10:45] stop pressing forth in the spirit and
[1:10:48] they begin to cool off and relax and
[1:10:49] fall back. But praise God, there's a
[1:10:51] whole lot of things I still don't
[1:10:53] understand in the message. But I'm
[1:10:54] pressing forward in the spirit because
[1:10:57] it's been given to us. Amen. To consume
[1:10:59] and to become one with.
[1:11:02] That's right. Amen. That's right.
[1:11:05] Said, "Take it and eat it up, and it
[1:11:08] shall make thy belly bitter, but it
[1:11:11] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey." I
[1:11:13] think that's all of our experience.
[1:11:16] It was the most delicious thing we've
[1:11:17] ever heard in our lives. The mystery of
[1:11:20] God revealed, the great plan that God
[1:11:21] had, the three-fold purpose Christ is
[1:11:23] the mystery of God revealed, all of
[1:11:25] those things.
[1:11:26] But then when you go to live it and
[1:11:28] retell it and share it and rejection and
[1:11:30] persecution and
[1:11:33] becomes bitter as you digest it and it
[1:11:36] becomes one with you. You start to feel
[1:11:38] the bitterness of the life of Christ
[1:11:41] because he was rejected and he was cast
[1:11:43] out and he was pushed aside and he was
[1:11:45] accused of having devils and
[1:11:48] it
[1:11:54] verse 10. And I took the little book out
[1:11:56] of the angel's hand and I ate it up and
[1:11:59] it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And
[1:12:01] as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was
[1:12:03] bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must
[1:12:08] prophesy again." Amen. Before many
[1:12:11] peoples and nations and tongues, and
[1:12:14] kings,
[1:12:17] I looked up this word
[1:12:20] prophesy. Amen. And in the Greek, it has
[1:12:24] the traditional meanings that we would
[1:12:26] understand to speak forth by divine
[1:12:28] inspiration to predict the future, the
[1:12:31] foretelling of future events. But
[1:12:33] there's also a definition in the
[1:12:34] concordance in the Strong's concordance
[1:12:36] and it says to utter forth declare a
[1:12:40] thing which can only be known by divine
[1:12:43] revelation.
[1:12:45] Amen.
[1:12:48] Oh, praise be to God. He says, "Go
[1:12:51] prophesy again." Amen. He's not telling
[1:12:53] the bride. Amen. You've got to go and
[1:12:55] tell future events and you got to
[1:12:57] accurately predict what's going to
[1:12:58] happen in the next chain of events in
[1:13:00] the world. You don't. That's not what
[1:13:02] he's talking about. But he's talking
[1:13:03] about to utter forth to declare a thing
[1:13:06] which can only be known by divine
[1:13:09] revelation. You can only know this by
[1:13:11] eating the book. You can only know this
[1:13:13] by becoming one with the message, by
[1:13:15] receiving it into yourself, by having a
[1:13:17] revelation from God Almighty. Amen. of
[1:13:20] what this message is,
[1:13:23] what this book is. And then he says,
[1:13:26] then he says, "Prophesy again."
[1:13:29] That's my favorite part of this
[1:13:31] scripture.
[1:13:32] Prophesy again. Why does he say prophesy
[1:13:34] again? Listen, there's so many times we
[1:13:37] read things in the Bible and we can get
[1:13:39] the wrong understanding of what it means
[1:13:40] or the application. And we see so many
[1:13:43] mistakes that that now we're trying a as
[1:13:46] a bride of Jesus Christ trying to
[1:13:47] predict things or move into a prophetic
[1:13:49] realm. Amen. And be a prophetic people
[1:13:51] and operate in this realm. Hey, listen.
[1:13:53] He said prophesy again.
[1:13:56] Which means all you're going to do is
[1:13:59] prophesy what's already been prophesied.
[1:14:01] Prophesy again. Remember, this bride
[1:14:04] doesn't have her own message. Amen.
[1:14:06] She's under the messenger for her age.
[1:14:09] She can only say what's been said.
[1:14:13] She can only declare what's been
[1:14:15] revealed. She can only prophesy again.
[1:14:17] She can't prophesy. She can only
[1:14:19] prophesy again.
[1:14:22] Amen. Remember, Brother Brim said Elijah
[1:14:24] and Elisha, our bridegroom and bride,
[1:14:27] husband and wife. And and and in the
[1:14:29] Elijah ministry, when Elijah, Amen, was
[1:14:32] on the earth, amen, he had a mantle
[1:14:34] which was the representation of his
[1:14:36] prophetic office. He was a prophet.
[1:14:38] Right. Amen. Amen. And God came to him
[1:14:40] when he was in the cave hiding out and
[1:14:43] God gave him a commission. And that
[1:14:44] commission had three parts to the
[1:14:45] commission.
[1:14:47] First, go anoint Elisha in thystead.
[1:14:50] Anoint the king over Syria. Anoint the
[1:14:52] king over Israel. So he went forth to do
[1:14:55] that. And he went and he threw that
[1:14:57] mantle over the shoulders of Elisha.
[1:14:59] Remember bridegroom and bride. That's
[1:15:01] it. That's right. So Elisha now has to
[1:15:04] burn everything, destroy his occupation,
[1:15:08] destroy everything, and go and follow go
[1:15:10] amen this prophet. And now Elisha's
[1:15:13] following the prophet
[1:15:17] until the prophet goes off the scene.
[1:15:20] He says, "What is it that I'll give to
[1:15:22] you?" And remember, this prophet is
[1:15:23] always testing Elisha. Yes, sir. That's
[1:15:26] through four stages of testing. He says,
[1:15:28] "You stay here. I'm going forth." He
[1:15:30] says, "I'll not do it. Wherever you go,
[1:15:33] I'll go.
[1:15:35] Hallelujah. Oh, so much like Ruth.
[1:15:37] Wherever you go, I'll go. Where your
[1:15:39] people are, my people. Where you die,
[1:15:40] I'll die. But I will not leave you
[1:15:42] because Naomi represented the old
[1:15:44] church, the old truth, the old way, the
[1:15:46] old word. And I'm not leaving this.
[1:15:50] And now he says this is the second
[1:15:52] stage. You stay here, I'll go down. Not
[1:15:54] having it. No way. Third stage, he
[1:15:57] brings you through justification,
[1:15:59] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:16:00] Ghost. all the way across Jordan. That's
[1:16:03] right. To the token, the Holy Ghost
[1:16:06] himself. And all along the way, he tries
[1:16:08] to get him to stop somewhere. Stop here
[1:16:09] at justification. Stop at
[1:16:11] sanctification. Stop at the baptism of
[1:16:13] Holy Ghost. Stop. He's not I'm not
[1:16:15] stopping. I'm going all the way. All the
[1:16:18] way. Wherever you go, prophet, I'm
[1:16:20] going. Whatever you believe, I believe.
[1:16:22] Whatever you say, I'll say. And when God
[1:16:25] takes that prophet away, he's asked for
[1:16:27] a double portion of what the prophet
[1:16:29] had. He says, "If you see me go," I
[1:16:31] mean, that means Elisha had to recognize
[1:16:34] that Elijah was gone.
[1:16:37] It was so important for him to recognize
[1:16:39] there's been a change. Amen. He had to
[1:16:41] see the change and know the change. When
[1:16:43] he comes back to the school of prophets,
[1:16:45] they missed it all. They saw Elisha come
[1:16:47] down to the Listen, Elisha. Oh,
[1:16:51] you're pulling so hard. You pull me
[1:16:53] plumb past where I'm supposed to be. I
[1:16:56] don't even know what I'm supposed to say
[1:16:58] anymore.
[1:17:03] Just give me a break.
[1:17:08] Hallelujah. When Elijah goes up, he
[1:17:10] sends his mantle down.
[1:17:13] You know what that means?
[1:17:15] Elisha has no prophetic office of his
[1:17:18] own.
[1:17:21] Elisha is operating under Elijah's
[1:17:24] mantle. Elijah's prophetic office. Uh,
[1:17:28] it's a continuation of the Elijah
[1:17:30] ministry. And Elijah, not a new
[1:17:32] prophetic office. It's prophesy again.
[1:17:36] Amen. Not a new commission finishing the
[1:17:38] same commission because Elijah didn't do
[1:17:41] two of the three things. Only anointed
[1:17:44] the bride. Amen. But now Elisha has to
[1:17:47] anoint the new king in Syri. What's he
[1:17:49] doing? He didn't get new prophecy. He
[1:17:51] didn't get new this. He's finishing the
[1:17:53] prophecy that was given to Elijah cuz
[1:17:55] now he's operating under Elijah's
[1:17:58] prophetic
[1:17:59] office, not his own. This bride doesn't
[1:18:02] have her own. She's operating under the
[1:18:04] Elijah mantle.
[1:18:08] That's why we don't come up with new
[1:18:09] doctrines and new things and stuff that
[1:18:12] the prophet didn't teach and outside the
[1:18:13] message. We have no room for any of
[1:18:15] that. Friend, listen, it'll take the
[1:18:18] rest of our lives to figure out what
[1:18:20] that prophet taught. Amen. And we'll
[1:18:22] probably still be discovering it even
[1:18:23] after we're out of here.
[1:18:26] We don't need anything else. We need to
[1:18:28] stay under the prophet messenger. And
[1:18:30] under the prophet messenger, she's the
[1:18:32] final voice to the final age. Which
[1:18:33] means you lose your right to be the
[1:18:35] final voice if you step out from under
[1:18:37] the headship of that prophet.
[1:18:41] You come out from under the headship of
[1:18:42] that mantle.
[1:18:44] You have no authority. You have no
[1:18:46] right.
[1:18:48] You have no voice.
[1:18:52] So he must prophesy again. That's it
[1:18:55] right there. That's good. To
[1:18:59] declare that a thing which can only be
[1:19:02] known by divine revelation. That's
[1:19:04] right. There you are. That's why brother
[1:19:06] Jason thrilled my heart when he said,
[1:19:08] "We're not parrots."
[1:19:11] Amen.
[1:19:12] Listen, we're told to say what the tapes
[1:19:14] say.
[1:19:16] Is that right?
[1:19:18] Do you know brother Brandham told us
[1:19:20] when he was beyond the curtain of time
[1:19:22] in the sixth dimension and he asked they
[1:19:24] told him you'll be judged for what you
[1:19:25] preached and he said well John will Paul
[1:19:27] be judged said yes he says well good I
[1:19:30] preached what Paul preached
[1:19:33] so brother Brandham only preached what
[1:19:34] Paul preached do we all agree
[1:19:37] when did you ever see brother Brandham
[1:19:39] come up to the pull pit and said please
[1:19:40] turn to Romans chapter 1 and he read
[1:19:43] from Romans chapter 1 through Romans
[1:19:45] chapter 2 said all right come back this
[1:19:47] evening evening and we will read Romans
[1:19:49] chapter 3 to chapter 5. Come back on
[1:19:52] Wednesday and we'll read from chapter 5
[1:19:54] to chapter 7. Come back on Sunday and
[1:19:56] we'll read from chapter 7 to chapter 10.
[1:19:59] So what do you mean? He preached only
[1:20:01] what Paul preached. Amen. He preached
[1:20:03] content. He preached subject. He
[1:20:05] preached doctrine of the same that Paul
[1:20:08] preached. But he didn't just come back
[1:20:09] and parrot what Paul said. He took what
[1:20:12] Paul said and ran it through the entire
[1:20:14] scripture.
[1:20:15] [Applause]
[1:20:17] That's right. So to say what the tapes
[1:20:19] say is just like brother Brandon
[1:20:21] preaching what Paul preached.
[1:20:25] Amen. That's right.
[1:20:28] Praise be to God.
[1:20:34] So
[1:20:36] you know what? We're supposed to be a
[1:20:38] lot further along than we are now.
[1:20:41] But praise God. Let God have his way.
[1:20:44] Amen.
[1:20:47] So now something
[1:20:49] happened that gave John the
[1:20:52] ability to take the forbidden
[1:20:56] book that couldn't be looked at or
[1:20:58] touched or opened or read. Now he goes
[1:21:03] to take it
[1:21:05] and to eat it and to become one with the
[1:21:09] book. Amen. And then to prophesy again.
[1:21:12] Amen.
[1:21:15] And the message Christ is the mystery of
[1:21:17] God revealed. He says now you see the
[1:21:20] seals when he was in his mediator work
[1:21:23] back there redeeming. But someday he
[1:21:24] comes forth to get this book that he's
[1:21:26] redeemed and all that's in the book
[1:21:29] would be him. Do you believe that?
[1:21:34] Listen. For that's the believer.
[1:21:38] The word's in the book
[1:21:40] and the word is him.
[1:21:45] Amen. All that would be in the book. You
[1:21:48] know, brother Bram calls this book many
[1:21:50] things. Calls it a book of redemption.
[1:21:53] Amen. It he calls it the uh the book of
[1:21:57] life of the lamb. He calls it a marriage
[1:22:00] certificate.
[1:22:02] Amen. Amen. Amen. And he tells us that
[1:22:06] everything in the book is him. Yes, sir.
[1:22:09] Yes. So that book is a record of Christ.
[1:22:13] Amen. Of Jesus Christ. Amen. His life.
[1:22:17] Exactly right. He says, "So all that's
[1:22:19] in the book is him."
[1:22:23] For that's the believer. Amen. Wait,
[1:22:27] wait a second.
[1:22:29] I'm a believer.
[1:22:31] Are you a believer?
[1:22:34] So all that's in this book is Christ.
[1:22:38] For that's the believer.
[1:22:41] The word's in the book.
[1:22:43] That's it. That's right. The word's in
[1:22:46] the book and the word is him. Amen. So
[1:22:50] you mean John looked and saw his name in
[1:22:53] the book? He had a part in that book cuz
[1:22:55] he was part of the word and he was part
[1:22:57] of Christ and he was always part of that
[1:23:00] word. And when the lamb came and
[1:23:01] overcame and took the book and loosed
[1:23:03] the seals now. Amen. Now he's able to go
[1:23:07] take the book because he's part of the
[1:23:09] book. He He's in the book. He's included
[1:23:12] in this record of Christ. He's one of
[1:23:15] the words in the book. He's one of the
[1:23:17] believers and this is all about Christ.
[1:23:19] But he's part of Christ. But he was
[1:23:21] separated from the book. Amen. That's
[1:23:23] it. That's it right there. He was
[1:23:25] separated from the mind of God. He was
[1:23:27] alienated from this truth. He did come
[1:23:30] through the world in darkness. He didn't
[1:23:31] know who he was, where he came from,
[1:23:32] where he was going, all about it. But
[1:23:34] the re revelation of it was in the book.
[1:23:37] The fact that he was part of Christ.
[1:23:42] Hallelujah. So God had to do something
[1:23:47] so he can give the book back
[1:23:50] to the ones who are in the book.
[1:23:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:01] Amen. Because this book is also an
[1:24:04] inheritance. That's it. A title deed, a
[1:24:07] will, a contract. Amen. It's you. You
[1:24:11] can use so many words to describe it.
[1:24:13] Brother Brandham uses so many words. It
[1:24:14] all means the same thing. It's part of
[1:24:17] our inheritance. The right to rule.
[1:24:23] Brother Bam comes. Now, I'm going to
[1:24:25] talk about worthy to take the book.
[1:24:28] Listen, John knew he wasn't worthy.
[1:24:30] That's right. To take the book. That's
[1:24:32] right. So, I don't think John changed
[1:24:36] his mind about his worthiness from
[1:24:38] chapter 5 to chapter 10.
[1:24:43] Hallelujah. What do you think?
[1:24:46] But there was a voice from heaven that
[1:24:49] told him to go take the book. Amen. So
[1:24:52] that means somebody else changed their
[1:24:55] mind about his worthiness.
[1:25:00] Hallelujah.
[1:25:05] Something happened. There you go,
[1:25:06] brother. That's about as easy as you can
[1:25:09] sum it up. If you try to explain what
[1:25:11] that something is, we'll get off into
[1:25:12] the weeds somewhere. But something
[1:25:14] happened.
[1:25:15] Yes, sir.
[1:25:17] He He I mean, he probably felt the same
[1:25:19] way he did in verse 5, only he's super
[1:25:21] excited now because somebody took the
[1:25:23] book and now he's mesmerized by the
[1:25:25] opening of the seals and the symbols and
[1:25:26] all that. And he heard the seven
[1:25:29] thunders. There you are. Listen,
[1:25:33] they were not a mystery to John. No,
[1:25:35] that's right. Exactly. Because John was
[1:25:37] told to take a pen and write everything
[1:25:40] you hear and everything you see and
[1:25:42] everything that's told to you, write it
[1:25:44] down in a book. So John hears the seven
[1:25:46] thunders utter their voice. And he says,
[1:25:48] "And I was about to write." That means
[1:25:51] John, the type of the bride, heard the
[1:25:53] voice of the seven thunders and it
[1:25:55] uttered something intelligible that
[1:25:58] could be written down. Amen. That's
[1:26:00] right. Exactly.
[1:26:02] So, he got the revelation of the seven
[1:26:05] thunders.
[1:26:07] That's right. Look at the sequence of
[1:26:09] events. The mighty angel and the lamb
[1:26:11] takes the book. He opens the seals. The
[1:26:13] mighty angel comes down. Seven thunders
[1:26:16] utter their voice. And then John's told
[1:26:17] to seal it up. But John has now gone
[1:26:20] through Revelation chapter 5, chapter 6,
[1:26:22] chapter 7, chapter 8. He's come all the
[1:26:25] way to chapter 10. He's heard the seven
[1:26:27] thunders utter their voice and he
[1:26:29] comprehended the voice.
[1:26:32] That's right.
[1:26:35] And that's the time
[1:26:38] after the mystery of God was finished.
[1:26:40] There you are. That now the voice from
[1:26:43] heaven said, "Now, John, you take the
[1:26:46] book."
[1:26:48] Hallelujah. There you are. John was no
[1:26:51] more worthy than he was the moment
[1:26:52] before. Amen. But that voice, Amen.
[1:26:56] deemed him worthy. That's right. That's
[1:27:00] right. Because the worthy one had paid
[1:27:02] the price on his behalf. And now it was
[1:27:05] all meat. And now he was included in
[1:27:07] that. And now he was able to step
[1:27:09] forward and take the book. Amen.
[1:27:14] Amen. Amen. And the invisible union.
[1:27:17] Brother man preaches this right at the
[1:27:18] end of his ministry. This is November
[1:27:20] 25th, 1965.
[1:27:22] This is such an important message
[1:27:24] because he's talking about the invisible
[1:27:25] union of the bride of Christ. And
[1:27:26] there's an union going on a marriage.
[1:27:28] Amen. He uh he tells us this in proving
[1:27:31] his word that the marriage takes place
[1:27:32] now. There's an invisible union taking
[1:27:34] place with Christ and his bride because
[1:27:36] the mighty angel has descended with the
[1:27:38] open book. So this marriage has
[1:27:40] everything to do with this book. Amen.
[1:27:43] Amen.
[1:27:45] Praise God.
[1:27:47] Amen. And so now he's preaching
[1:27:49] invisible union. And when he comes
[1:27:51] invisible union now, he makes some
[1:27:53] statements. He says, "You're standing
[1:27:56] completely." Amen. You never sinned at
[1:27:59] the first place. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:03] Amen.
[1:28:05] Listen, I've done a lot of sinning in my
[1:28:07] life. Got a whole bunch of mistakes.
[1:28:08] Brother Brenham said, "I backslide every
[1:28:10] day." But Brother Brenham is not looking
[1:28:12] at your earthly existence anymore. He's
[1:28:15] going back to the first place. What was
[1:28:17] the first place when you were an
[1:28:18] attribute in the mind of God? Amen. Your
[1:28:21] that seed gene that's inside of you was
[1:28:23] in the mind of God. That's your first
[1:28:25] place. That's your origin. That's where
[1:28:27] you come from before there was any sin
[1:28:30] before there was a fall in the garden.
[1:28:32] Before any of that, that's your first
[1:28:33] place. And that's what this book tells
[1:28:36] you.
[1:28:38] This book tells you that you were there.
[1:28:42] That's right. You never sinned at the
[1:28:45] first place. God don't even know. That's
[1:28:47] right. It's in the sea of forgetfulness.
[1:28:49] You never did it. That's right. Amen.
[1:28:53] You were accused of it by the accuser,
[1:28:55] but really from the beginning, you were
[1:28:58] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[1:29:00] of God. That's it. You're standing there
[1:29:02] washed. And your old book of divorcement
[1:29:05] is put away and it's dead. Absolutely
[1:29:08] out of existence.
[1:29:11] Even in the mind of God. Oh, I wish I
[1:29:13] could get it out of existence in my
[1:29:14] mind. That's one of the challenges we
[1:29:17] fight. That's the battle we fight every
[1:29:19] day is cuz that old book of divorcement
[1:29:21] is still alive in my mind. The old
[1:29:22] hybridization, the old born wrong
[1:29:24] condition, it's still in my mind, but
[1:29:26] it's not in God's mind anymore.
[1:29:30] [Applause]
[1:29:33] Exactly right. Oh, not even in the mind
[1:29:37] of God. Listen what he says. You're the
[1:29:40] virtuous bride of Christ. Washed in the
[1:29:43] blood of Christ. Precious, virtuous,
[1:29:47] sinless son of God, standing with a
[1:29:49] pure, unadulterated bride that he washed
[1:29:53] by the water of his own blood that
[1:29:55] became flesh and manifested that he
[1:29:57] might take you. Amen.
[1:30:00] Listen. Why did he wash you in the blood
[1:30:03] of his own word? Why did he wash you in
[1:30:04] his own blood? Why did he wash the
[1:30:06] bride? And in Ephesians chapter 5, why
[1:30:09] did he wash her with the water of the
[1:30:10] word? So that he could present to
[1:30:12] himself a bride without spot or blemish
[1:30:15] or any such thing. He had to do the work
[1:30:18] of purification. And he had to bring the
[1:30:20] word of purification so that he could
[1:30:23] take his bride cuz he can't take her
[1:30:25] polluted. He could only take her after
[1:30:27] she's been purified.
[1:30:31] So he sent a word that would purify her.
[1:30:35] Absolutely. Amen. Amen. So he's son of
[1:30:38] God standing with a pure unadulterated
[1:30:40] bride word that he washed by the water
[1:30:42] of his own blood that became flesh and
[1:30:43] manifest that he might take you which
[1:30:47] were predestinated in the bosom of the
[1:30:49] father before the beginning the same as
[1:30:52] he was. There you are. That's it.
[1:30:56] That's right. Where did you come from?
[1:30:58] That's it. Because wherever he came from
[1:31:00] is where you're going. That's right.
[1:31:03] Amen. Yes, sir. That's what puts your
[1:31:05] name in the book. That's it.
[1:31:08] That's the truth. Not your conduct, not
[1:31:10] your merit, not your ability, not
[1:31:12] anything. That's what bound the book
[1:31:14] from us. But what put your name in the
[1:31:17] book was his thought of you before the
[1:31:18] foundation of the world. And you, when
[1:31:21] Christ was chosen, when the lamb was
[1:31:23] chosen, you were the chosen the same as
[1:31:24] he was.
[1:31:28] Praise the Lord. Yes, sir. That's right.
[1:31:30] Amen. again in invisible union says your
[1:31:33] first wedding was analled.
[1:31:36] Hallelujah. It was you never done it in
[1:31:39] the first place.
[1:31:42] Amen. That's right.
[1:31:45] Your first wedding to your old nature.
[1:31:47] That's right. That's what he's talking
[1:31:48] about. To the old Adam nature, to the
[1:31:49] fallen nature. That is divorced. That
[1:31:52] wedding's analled. You came wrong. You
[1:31:55] should have came right, but you came
[1:31:56] anyway. But you were born wrong. Now
[1:31:58] that first wedding's analled. You never
[1:32:00] done it in the first place because
[1:32:02] there's only one thing could do it. That
[1:32:03] would be God come down himself and took
[1:32:06] your place in the form of son of God,
[1:32:07] Jesus Christ, and washed you by the
[1:32:09] water. The washing of the water by the
[1:32:11] word. The word, not the denomination.
[1:32:14] The word washed you. Is there any
[1:32:16] question what you're washed by, friends?
[1:32:19] There's no question because he's saying
[1:32:21] not a denomination. So now he's talking
[1:32:23] about teaching and doctrine and
[1:32:25] restoration of truth. What is washing
[1:32:27] you? This message is washing you.
[1:32:30] This restored word, this revealed word
[1:32:33] is washing you. Why? Oh, why does he
[1:32:36] call it bleeding word? Listen. Because
[1:32:38] the word, he said, bled for you. The
[1:32:40] word died for you. It bled for you. What
[1:32:42] word? All the word. Because all the
[1:32:44] word, Amen. was made flesh. Amen. In the
[1:32:48] flesh of Jesus Christ. All the word. All
[1:32:52] the word. Are you part of the word? Yes,
[1:32:54] sir. Yes, sir. Then you were in the
[1:32:56] flesh of Jesus Christ. That's right. You
[1:32:58] were part of the word made flesh. You
[1:33:00] were in him then, brother Benham said.
[1:33:02] And so now all the word is bundled up
[1:33:05] and wrapped up into a manifestation of
[1:33:07] flesh in Jesus Christ. And that word
[1:33:10] bleeds
[1:33:12] physically bleeds. It's nailed to the
[1:33:15] cross, the body, because the word was
[1:33:16] made flesh.
[1:33:18] Amen. And that body bled for you. And
[1:33:21] the blood represents the life. And
[1:33:23] brother Bam tells us that the life,
[1:33:25] Amen, was released to come back upon us,
[1:33:27] brother. The blood is a represent in the
[1:33:29] token. He makes this so simple. He said
[1:33:31] it's not the chemistry that we're after.
[1:33:33] Now, he said, listen what he says that
[1:33:36] went into the Judean soil and turned
[1:33:39] back into the elements of the food and
[1:33:41] things he ate. Now, I can't even believe
[1:33:43] somebody would say that about the blood
[1:33:44] of Jesus Christ. If it wasn't for a
[1:33:46] prophet in this age, I would recoil from
[1:33:48] that statement.
[1:33:50] But he's trying to get us to see
[1:33:51] something, friends. I was not there at
[1:33:53] Calvary. I can't go and dip my finger on
[1:33:55] the blood that's driven that cross and
[1:33:57] apply it to me. So, how do I get a fresh
[1:33:59] application of the blood? I have to come
[1:34:01] to a fresh kill of the word where the
[1:34:04] word is bleeding fresh today.
[1:34:08] Because the word that we believe today
[1:34:11] was the word that was on the cross
[1:34:13] bleeding. And when I believe the word
[1:34:15] today, the word that I believe today
[1:34:18] already bled for me.
[1:34:23] And I'm linked to Calvary by the word.
[1:34:27] Hallelujah.
[1:34:30] I wasn't alive that day. I couldn't
[1:34:32] stand there when he was hanging from the
[1:34:33] cross and say, "That's the son of God.
[1:34:35] He's dying for me. I'm here now. I can't
[1:34:38] go back there." But today, it's the son
[1:34:40] of God. It's the revelation of Jesus
[1:34:43] Christ. And when I get a hold of that,
[1:34:46] [Applause]
[1:34:47] I'm linked right back to Calvary because
[1:34:49] it's the same word that was bleeding, my
[1:34:52] atonement is the same word that's
[1:34:54] atoning for me now.
[1:34:57] It's the bleeding bloody word with the
[1:35:00] life in it. Amen. That's why he calls it
[1:35:03] bleeding word because this word has
[1:35:06] life.
[1:35:09] And it's the life of the word that is
[1:35:12] washing his blood.
[1:35:14] This isn't a sterile word, friends. This
[1:35:17] isn't uh reciting of poetry. This isn't
[1:35:20] reading of a text. This isn't giving
[1:35:22] speeches. This is a living, breathing
[1:35:24] word with life in it.
[1:35:27] Hallelujah.
[1:35:30] That's right. So, he washed you with the
[1:35:32] word, not the denomination. The word
[1:35:33] washed you. But if you won't stand in
[1:35:35] the water of the word, how are you going
[1:35:37] to be washed? You're still as spotted as
[1:35:39] Eve was. That's right. Amen.
[1:35:46] So, that means I have to stay under this
[1:35:48] message.
[1:35:51] If I won't stay under the washing of
[1:35:52] this word, I'll be as spotted as evil.
[1:35:55] Amen. Amen. Again, in the invisible
[1:35:57] union, he says, "What is sin?" Sin is
[1:35:59] unbelief. Unbelief in what? The word.
[1:36:02] Amen. Unbelief in God, which is the
[1:36:04] word. Then he goes on says, "Pure,
[1:36:06] unadulterated." Oh, hallelujah. Leaving
[1:36:09] soon for the skies. Amen. Standing
[1:36:10] ready. Think your garments washed by the
[1:36:13] water of the bleeding word. The word
[1:36:14] became blood. The word bled for you. And
[1:36:16] you were washed in the bleeding word.
[1:36:18] The word bleeding. The life of God in
[1:36:20] the word. and the word was bled for you
[1:36:23] that you might be washed from the filth
[1:36:24] of these prostitutes and be cleansed
[1:36:26] cleaned and sanctified by the washing of
[1:36:29] the water of the word and makes your
[1:36:31] mind and heart stayed on God and on his
[1:36:33] word.
[1:36:35] Further down he says hallelujah. Now
[1:36:37] notice you're not only that but you're
[1:36:39] going to the wedding in the sky and
[1:36:41] you're wearing the wedding band of
[1:36:43] predestination. Unmmerited grace. A
[1:36:46] wedding band of grace unmmerited of your
[1:36:48] own.
[1:36:51] Who is worthy? You're certainly not
[1:36:53] worthy. Amen. This wedding band is not
[1:36:55] by your merit. This wedding band is by
[1:36:57] his grace.
[1:37:02] God did it himself. He knew you before
[1:37:04] the foundation of the world. So, he
[1:37:06] slipped the wedding band on you there.
[1:37:10] Hey, listen. You didn't get this wedding
[1:37:11] band of predestination grace. You didn't
[1:37:14] get it when you came to the altar and
[1:37:16] gave your heart to the Lord and
[1:37:17] surrendered to the man. No, you got it
[1:37:19] before the foundation of the world. He
[1:37:21] slipped that wedding band on you. Then
[1:37:23] you were always going to be his bride.
[1:37:27] That was what was bound up in this book.
[1:37:30] Praise the Lord. Praise be to God. Amen.
[1:37:34] Praise the Lord. He slipped your wedding
[1:37:37] band on you there. Put your name on the
[1:37:39] book. What a thanksgiving. Hallelujah.
[1:37:43] Praise our God. This is brother
[1:37:45] Brandham's thanksgiving message. I say
[1:37:48] thank God.
[1:37:50] Amen.
[1:37:52] Now listen again in invisible union. Now
[1:37:56] your
[1:37:57] name is now in the new book. Amen. Not
[1:38:01] the book of life, but the lamb's book of
[1:38:03] life which the lamb redeemed. Not the
[1:38:05] old book of your natural union, but your
[1:38:07] new bride. Hallelujah. Your new life is
[1:38:10] in the lamb's book of life. your
[1:38:12] marriage certificate. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:38:17] Hallelujah. Where your true eternal germ
[1:38:19] from the beginning takes hold. Now
[1:38:22] you're not only forgiven, but you are
[1:38:25] justified. Brother Bam gives it the
[1:38:28] definition of justified as if you never
[1:38:30] did it the first place. You never did
[1:38:33] it. Why? That eternal germ inside of you
[1:38:35] that's an attribute of God. Never
[1:38:37] sinned, never disbelieved, never
[1:38:39] disbelieved one word. Your mind did.
[1:38:42] Your body acted out unbelief. But that
[1:38:44] germ of God never disbelieved the word
[1:38:46] of God. It was waiting to be watered by
[1:38:49] a certain word, by the water of the
[1:38:50] word. And when that word hit it, it
[1:38:52] sprung to life and believed every word.
[1:38:58] And now he calls this book, Lamb's book
[1:39:01] of life, the marriage certificate.
[1:39:07] So the question is, who is worthy to
[1:39:09] take the book?
[1:39:11] Only the lamb is worthy to take the
[1:39:13] book. Amen. But once the lamb takes the
[1:39:16] book and looses the seals,
[1:39:19] sounds the seven thunders. That's right.
[1:39:21] Finishes the mystery. That's right. Now
[1:39:24] there's a command for John. Type of the
[1:39:27] bride. Now, now, now that's exactly
[1:39:32] right. go to Christ
[1:39:35] and take the book
[1:39:38] because a marriage certificate belongs
[1:39:41] to two people
[1:39:46] [Applause]
[1:39:51] who has more rights of the marriage
[1:39:53] certificate, the husband or the wife?
[1:39:55] That's exactly right. Amen.
[1:39:59] You realize
[1:40:02] marriage justifies the woman. Amen.
[1:40:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:40:10] Amen. That's right.
[1:40:14] I want to ask you another question.
[1:40:19] Did the l Does the lamb have a wife?
[1:40:22] Yes, sir.
[1:40:24] Which is the bride.
[1:40:26] Now, the
[1:40:28] lamb can only marry its own species.
[1:40:33] That's right.
[1:40:36] Amen.
[1:40:41] The word can only be married to the
[1:40:43] word.
[1:40:45] That's right. That's exactly the lamb's
[1:40:48] wife
[1:40:50] would have the identity of her husband.
[1:40:55] In marriage, the woman, no matter what
[1:40:58] her what her identification was before,
[1:41:01] she comes to a marriage ceremony and she
[1:41:03] comes up to a union to a man, she may
[1:41:05] come up a Smith. She may come up a
[1:41:07] Miller. She may come up whatever name
[1:41:08] she is. That's her old identity under
[1:41:11] her first birth. That's it.
[1:41:15] Under natural parents, it might be on
[1:41:17] her birth certificate. That's right. But
[1:41:20] when she comes to be unified with this
[1:41:22] man, Amen. And then the minister turns
[1:41:24] around and says, "I'd like to present to
[1:41:25] you Mr. and Mrs. whatever the man's name
[1:41:30] is."
[1:41:32] Amen. My wife came up a Mckenry.
[1:41:36] We got married. But you know what the
[1:41:38] minister said? I now pronounce you man
[1:41:39] and wife. You may greet your bride. Turn
[1:41:41] and face the audience. I would like to
[1:41:43] present to you Mr. and Mrs. Chad Lamb.
[1:41:46] Her name's not mentioned at all. She
[1:41:49] gets the title Mrs. because her identity
[1:41:51] now is locked up in marriage in my
[1:41:54] identity.
[1:41:58] She is Mrs. Chad Lamb. She has rights to
[1:42:02] my name. She has rights to use my name.
[1:42:04] Hey, listen. After we were married, my
[1:42:06] wife didn't work. Amen. She stayed home
[1:42:08] with the kids and and she went I think
[1:42:10] it was five years she had had no
[1:42:11] employment. No employment. No earned
[1:42:14] income outside the house. She goes to
[1:42:15] Kohl's department store and they said,
[1:42:17] "You can get 20% off if you sign this
[1:42:19] application." She filled out an
[1:42:21] application. She wrote down her name.
[1:42:23] That didn't get her any credit. She
[1:42:24] wrote down my name approved. Amen.
[1:42:28] [Applause]
[1:42:32] I didn't even have to sign the document
[1:42:34] cuz she's my wife. She has rights to use
[1:42:36] my name for credit. She has right to use
[1:42:39] my name for gain. She has right to every
[1:42:41] Hey, listen. When we take the marriage
[1:42:43] vows, I say with all my earthly
[1:42:46] possessions, I thee and endow.
[1:42:49] Amen. Why? Because the scripture says we
[1:42:51] are heirs, joint hes with Christ, equal
[1:42:54] airs with Jesus Christ. He is sharing
[1:42:57] the inheritance with his wife.
[1:43:01] Amen. That's right.
[1:43:03] So marriage justifies the woman. Yes,
[1:43:06] sir. Listen, when that man accepts that
[1:43:10] woman to be his wife, it doesn't matter
[1:43:13] what her past life was. Hallelujah. It
[1:43:15] doesn't matter the rumors you heard. It
[1:43:18] doesn't matter what what what little
[1:43:20] thing was buzzing around or what you saw
[1:43:22] happen or what you thought about her
[1:43:24] testimony before because this man says
[1:43:27] she's worthy. Amen. That's it. I deem
[1:43:30] her worthy to give her my name and my
[1:43:34] identification and become one with her.
[1:43:36] And his choice makes her worthy.
[1:43:40] Amen. Not her conduct, not her past
[1:43:43] life, but his choice makes her worthy.
[1:43:46] And when he throws his umbrella over her
[1:43:48] of his name and his life and takes her,
[1:43:50] he justifies her from her past life. Now
[1:43:53] it doesn't matter to me what happened
[1:43:55] before and where you went, what mistakes
[1:43:57] you made. You are now my bride. You are
[1:44:00] now Mrs. Jesus Christ. You are now mine.
[1:44:03] You have my identity. I share my life
[1:44:05] with you. You will bring forth my seed.
[1:44:07] I He has justified her by marriage.
[1:44:14] Amen. In this age. And brother Mam says,
[1:44:16] "We've come to true justification." Why?
[1:44:19] Because a lamb can only marry a lamb.
[1:44:21] The word can only marry the word. And
[1:44:23] when he chose you, you didn't choose
[1:44:25] him. He chose you. You weren't looking
[1:44:27] for him. He was seeking you out. And
[1:44:29] when he came to you and he told you to
[1:44:31] take the book, he was telling you,
[1:44:33] you're my choice. And by choosing you,
[1:44:36] he has justified you.
[1:44:40] [Applause]
[1:44:43] And
[1:44:44] now you can take the book. That's right.
[1:44:47] That's right. By what? By marriage.
[1:44:51] That's exactly right. By being unified
[1:44:53] with this word when the head connects to
[1:44:55] the body. Amen. by coming into a union
[1:44:58] with Christ. He paid the price. He has
[1:45:01] the credit. He has the standards. He's
[1:45:04] got He meets all the qualifications. I
[1:45:06] meet none. Amen. That's right. Remember
[1:45:09] my wife at Kohl's?
[1:45:11] How much money have you earned the last
[1:45:12] 5 years? None.
[1:45:16] Are you married? Yes. Put your husband's
[1:45:18] name down.
[1:45:20] How much has he earned back then? It
[1:45:21] wasn't a lot more than none,
[1:45:23] but we were first married.
[1:45:30] But she got credit based off my life.
[1:45:35] That's right. My attributes,
[1:45:38] my work, my name. That's right.
[1:45:44] Hallelujah.
[1:45:46] Amen. And the first seal says, "Now
[1:45:48] watch." He said it would be known in the
[1:45:50] last day, but it comes forth in a church
[1:45:52] symbol. Do you understand it, church? It
[1:45:54] comes forth in a symbol of a church that
[1:45:56] they know there's a seal. This is when
[1:45:58] he's talking about white horse rider.
[1:45:59] It's a symbol. So, the church knows
[1:46:00] there's something there, but it's not
[1:46:02] revealed what it means. But just what it
[1:46:04] is yet, they don't know because it's a
[1:46:06] white horse rider. And it only is to be
[1:46:08] revealed at the last day when this
[1:46:11] actual seal is broken. Not in symbol
[1:46:15] form, but in actual revelation, which is
[1:46:17] the seven thunders. Amen. Says broken to
[1:46:20] who? Not to Christ, but to the church.
[1:46:26] He didn't break it for his own
[1:46:27] understanding. He broke it for you.
[1:46:31] Lord, notice now. Oh my. That just makes
[1:46:34] me tremble. I hope the church truly
[1:46:37] understands it. You people, I'm going to
[1:46:40] call you bride that you'll understand
[1:46:43] it.
[1:46:45] In order to understand what's happening,
[1:46:48] you have to go through a change in
[1:46:50] identification. And that change in
[1:46:52] identification is going to require you
[1:46:53] have a different title so that you'll
[1:46:55] catch what brother BM's trying to tell
[1:46:57] you. This is the marriage union. This is
[1:47:00] him claiming what's his. What is his is
[1:47:02] a bride. And now he's entered from his
[1:47:05] redeeming ministry to his claiming
[1:47:06] ministry. He's come to claim his bride.
[1:47:10] So the seal's broken to who? Not to
[1:47:12] Christ.
[1:47:14] to the church. Amen. And so that you'll
[1:47:17] not miss it, I'm going to change your
[1:47:20] name. That's it. Because every time
[1:47:22] there's a dispensational change in the
[1:47:23] Bible with the people of God, he changes
[1:47:25] their name. Amen.
[1:47:28] And he wanted us to go from church to
[1:47:30] bride. So we didn't think like a church
[1:47:32] anymore. Cuz you're not going to get
[1:47:34] this thinking like a church. You're only
[1:47:37] going to understand this transition
[1:47:38] thinking like a wife, like a bride.
[1:47:41] Glory. Glory to God. That's right. Total
[1:47:45] change in mindset.
[1:47:48] Oh, praise God. Amen. I got so many
[1:47:51] things, brothers and sisters, I want to
[1:47:53] share. Lord, help us. Amen. You know,
[1:47:57] that clock just runs crazy.
[1:48:02] I've always prayed that God would do
[1:48:03] something to it during the service and
[1:48:05] just blow it up.
[1:48:10] Amen. I want to go back for just a
[1:48:11] moment and look at the life of Abraham
[1:48:13] and
[1:48:14] Sarah. If you could turn with me to
[1:48:16] Genesis
[1:48:19] 17. You know, there was a promise to
[1:48:24] Abraham that he would bring forth seed.
[1:48:29] And you know, all along God gives
[1:48:31] limited information to Abraham.
[1:48:36] And God comes to Abraham and he'll he'll
[1:48:38] expound on the information in every
[1:48:40] visitation.
[1:48:41] He'll just give a little more detail.
[1:48:44] And we heard brother Jason say that when
[1:48:45] he brought him out to look at the stars
[1:48:47] going back to the original word. It's
[1:48:48] secure. Don't worry. But always he says
[1:48:51] now I'm going to call I'm going to make
[1:48:52] of you a great nation. So he leaves out
[1:48:54] and then he says there's going to come a
[1:48:56] seed forth from you. And then he then he
[1:48:58] starts to he starts to break it down. He
[1:49:00] starts to all time just like the Bible
[1:49:02] is always building this great
[1:49:03] revelation. Amen. Abraham's life is
[1:49:06] building this great secret revelation in
[1:49:08] his
[1:49:09] life. And every visitation brings more
[1:49:12] information and more confirmation and
[1:49:14] more understanding.
[1:49:17] And we know that the promise is to
[1:49:19] Abraham. Right.
[1:49:22] But by default, the promise to Abraham
[1:49:25] is also to Sarah. That's right. That's
[1:49:28] right. That's exactly right. Because
[1:49:31] Sarah is unified in marriage to Abraham.
[1:49:33] That's right. So, what's Abraham is also
[1:49:36] Sarah's. All right. Amen.
[1:49:39] But Sarah is struggling with this
[1:49:42] revelation.
[1:49:43] Amen.
[1:49:45] She She has an internal struggle because
[1:49:47] no doubt she knows that her husband had
[1:49:50] visitations. He had supernatural things
[1:49:52] happen. And there was times that the
[1:49:53] Lord came and he would speak audibly to
[1:49:56] Abraham. He would come to him in a
[1:49:57] vision. He would appear to him as a
[1:49:59] pillar of light. Amen. He would show up
[1:50:01] in flesh. There was many different ways
[1:50:02] that he would come and present himself
[1:50:04] to Abraham and give him more
[1:50:05] information. And if you follow through
[1:50:07] the Bible, I had a man in my church show
[1:50:09] me this one time and it absolutely
[1:50:10] mesmerized me. He says there's seven
[1:50:12] times that God visits Abraham either
[1:50:15] through a voice or a dream or a vision.
[1:50:18] And and the seventh time is the plains
[1:50:20] of memory. Amen. That's right. That's
[1:50:22] exactly right. when he comes in flesh.
[1:50:24] Yes, sir. Just like in the seventh age,
[1:50:26] brother Brennham types that visitation
[1:50:27] to the seventh age when Elohim steps
[1:50:30] into a body of flesh temporarily to
[1:50:32] deliver a message. And that was what God
[1:50:35] was doing through our messenger. That's
[1:50:36] right. In the seventh age, this is the
[1:50:39] seventh visitation. Amen. But until that
[1:50:42] time there's a no doubt Sarah knew no
[1:50:46] doubt Abraham shared with Sarah listen
[1:50:48] the Lord met me last night or I had a
[1:50:50] dream or the voice come to me and she
[1:50:52] was with him from the transfer from they
[1:50:55] moved into the to the to the promised
[1:50:57] land and all the trans she knew why they
[1:50:58] were going she knew why they were moving
[1:51:00] she knew what the prophecy was
[1:51:04] and she didn't disbelieve it because she
[1:51:06] didn't disbelieve the prophecy
[1:51:09] she believed believed that Abraham would
[1:51:12] have seen
[1:51:14] and the evidence of that is when she
[1:51:16] realized that she couldn't do it. That's
[1:51:18] it. She came up with another plan. Take
[1:51:20] Hagar, my maid, because this is
[1:51:22] according to the law. Amen. I can give
[1:51:24] you my handmmaid and you can raise up
[1:51:26] seed unto me from her.
[1:51:30] So, it wasn't that she didn't disbelieve
[1:51:32] the
[1:51:33] promise. She didn't understand her part
[1:51:36] in the promise. That's right.
[1:51:41] She doubt. She didn't doubt Abraham. She
[1:51:43] didn't doubt God. She doubted her.
[1:51:49] That's right.
[1:51:52] She comes up with the scheme with Hagar
[1:51:55] and they bring forth an Ishmael. And
[1:51:57] brother Benham said he was a the
[1:51:58] scripture says he was a wild man.
[1:52:01] That's what happens when we add our own
[1:52:03] ideas to the word, come up with our own
[1:52:06] play ways for it to be made manifest and
[1:52:08] try to get ahead of the program of God.
[1:52:11] The problem has always been getting
[1:52:12] ahead,
[1:52:14] not waiting,
[1:52:16] that's it. And then we come to Genesis
[1:52:18] 17. Let's just look at Genesis 17. We're
[1:52:21] skipping through a lot of things, but
[1:52:22] you know the story well.
[1:52:25] And in Genesis
[1:52:27] 17:15 says, "And God said unto Abraham,
[1:52:30] as for Sarah, thy wife, thou shalt not
[1:52:33] call her Sarai, but Sarah shall be her
[1:52:35] name." That's right. She got a name
[1:52:37] change. "And I will bless her and give
[1:52:39] thee a son also of her."
[1:52:43] This is more information.
[1:52:46] Now, listen, more information doesn't
[1:52:50] change the original truth of the
[1:52:52] prophecy.
[1:52:53] It was in God's mind always to bring
[1:52:56] Isaac through Sarah. He always knew it
[1:52:59] would be Sarah. It was implied when he
[1:53:01] promised it to Abraham. It was implied
[1:53:03] that it was for Sarah also because she
[1:53:05] was one with him. She just didn't
[1:53:07] understand that because it wasn't
[1:53:08] specifically spelled out. That's right.
[1:53:11] So when God comes and reveals more of
[1:53:14] the mystery and more of the prophecy,
[1:53:16] he's not adding to the prophecy. He's
[1:53:19] unveiling more of his mind. Amen.
[1:53:24] And so now he says, "I will bless thee
[1:53:27] and give her a son also of her, and I
[1:53:30] will bless her, and she shall be a
[1:53:31] mother of nations. Kings of people shall
[1:53:33] be of her." Then Abraham fell on his
[1:53:36] face and laughed and said in his heart,
[1:53:37] "Shall a child be born unto him that is
[1:53:39] 100 years old, and shall Sarah, that is
[1:53:42] 90 years old,
[1:53:44] bear?" So I'm not going to go any
[1:53:46] further with that. But now, now the
[1:53:48] prophecy specific. Now you guys were
[1:53:51] questioning how this was going to come.
[1:53:53] You thought maybe it would be by
[1:53:54] adoption through Eleazar. Now you
[1:53:56] thought it would be by the handmade
[1:53:58] Hagar. But now I'm telling you it's
[1:54:00] Sarah. Amen. No doubt about it. No
[1:54:03] question it's Sarah. And then he comes
[1:54:04] on the plains of And he comes on the
[1:54:07] plains of memory. Let's go to 181. And
[1:54:09] the Lord appeared unto him in the plains
[1:54:11] of memory. This is the seventh time the
[1:54:12] Lord comes to Abraham. And the Lord
[1:54:14] appeared unto him in the plains of
[1:54:15] memory and sat in the tent door in the
[1:54:17] heat of the day. And he lifted up his
[1:54:19] eyes and looked and lo, three men stood
[1:54:21] by him. And when he saw them, he ran to
[1:54:23] meet them from the tent door and bowed
[1:54:25] himself toward the ground and said, "My
[1:54:27] Lord." Brother Benham says, "See, this
[1:54:28] is the
[1:54:30] This is what separates him from the lot
[1:54:32] group. He saw three but knew there was
[1:54:34] only one God."
[1:54:36] And this revelation comes into clarity
[1:54:38] in the seventh age. Amen.
[1:54:43] He says now uh
[1:54:48] he bowed himself to the ground said my
[1:54:50] lord if now I have found favor in thy
[1:54:51] sight pass not away pray thee from thy
[1:54:53] servant let let a little water I pray
[1:54:55] you be fetched and wash your feet and
[1:54:57] rest yourselves under the tree and I
[1:54:58] will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort
[1:55:00] your hearts and after that you shall
[1:55:02] pass you pass on for therefore are you
[1:55:05] come to your servant and they said so do
[1:55:07] as thou has said and Abraham Abraham
[1:55:09] hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and
[1:55:12] said, "Make ready quickly the measures
[1:55:13] of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes
[1:55:15] upon the on the hearth." And Abraham ran
[1:55:17] into the herd, and fetched calf, tender,
[1:55:19] and good, and gave it unto the young
[1:55:21] men, and he hasted to dress it. And he
[1:55:23] took butter and milk. And so he does all
[1:55:25] of this work.
[1:55:27] He comes to verse nine. He's busy, amen,
[1:55:30] about all of these things. The Lord has
[1:55:32] come to him again. Now he's come in a
[1:55:34] body of flesh. And now he's working.
[1:55:36] He's fetching. He's asking him to come
[1:55:37] and sit and do all of this. And he never
[1:55:39] asked him, "What are you here for?"
[1:55:42] Amen. Why did you come? He just starts
[1:55:44] serving. Hey, Abraham says a lot. Amen.
[1:55:46] The Lord doesn't say anything. Abraham
[1:55:48] says a whole bunch and gets into action.
[1:55:50] And then finally, when Abraham quiets
[1:55:52] down, he
[1:55:53] says, "Where's Sarah?"
[1:55:58] Yeah.
[1:56:00] All of the sudden, he tipped him off to
[1:56:03] the purpose of his coming in the seventh
[1:56:05] visitation. Amen. There you are. Now,
[1:56:08] this time it's for Sarah. Amen.
[1:56:12] That's exactly right.
[1:56:14] Hallelujah. That's right.
[1:56:18] He says, "And they said unto him, where
[1:56:20] is Sarah thy wife?" And he said,
[1:56:22] "Behold, in the tent," he said, I will
[1:56:24] certainly return unto thee according to
[1:56:26] the time of life, and lo Sarah, thy wife
[1:56:28] shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in
[1:56:30] the tent door which was behind him. Now
[1:56:32] Abraham and Sarah were old and
[1:56:33] wellstricken in age. And it ceased to be
[1:56:35] with Sarah after the manner of women.
[1:56:37] Therefore Sarah laughed within herself,
[1:56:39] saying, After I am waxed old, shall I
[1:56:41] have pleasure with my Lord? And my Lord
[1:56:43] being old also. And the Lord said unto
[1:56:45] Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,
[1:56:47] saying, Shall I have shity bear a child
[1:56:49] which I'm old? Is anything too hard for
[1:56:52] the Lord? At the time appointed, I will
[1:56:54] return unto thee according to the time
[1:56:56] of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
[1:56:59] Then Sarah denied, saying, "I laugh not,
[1:57:01] for she was afraid." And he said, "Nay,
[1:57:03] but thou did laugh." Amen.
[1:57:09] So what is Sarah's struggle? Sarah's not
[1:57:13] struggling to believe the prophecy.
[1:57:15] Sarah's not struggling with Abraham's
[1:57:17] identity. Sarah is struggling with her
[1:57:20] part in the prophecy. That's right.
[1:57:22] That's right. And God came in the
[1:57:24] seventh age to turn his back to her tent
[1:57:26] to discern her thoughts so that he can
[1:57:28] say, "It's me and I'm here to confirm
[1:57:30] the promise."
[1:57:32] And we know that after this, Brother Bam
[1:57:34] tells us, "Amen." They they were
[1:57:35] restored after this visitation. They
[1:57:37] woke up young and and before that, I
[1:57:40] want to read this from marriage and
[1:57:41] divorce. Brother Bam said, "Why didn't
[1:57:42] God kill Sarah?"
[1:57:45] sitting right there denying and lying
[1:57:47] right in the face of God. Sitting there
[1:57:49] as a mortal man eating flesh, eating
[1:57:50] bread, drinking milk. And he said, "Why
[1:57:52] did Sarah laugh back there in the back
[1:57:54] behind him in the tent?" He never seen
[1:57:56] her saying, "How can these things be?"
[1:57:58] She said, "I never said it." God
[1:58:00] told God that he is a liar to his
[1:58:03] face. Did she fail? Yeah. She failed big
[1:58:07] time. Was she worthy of death?
[1:58:11] But he couldn't take her. That's it.
[1:58:13] That's right. Why? Because she's a part
[1:58:16] of Abraham.
[1:58:20] He couldn't hurt her without hurting
[1:58:22] Abraham.
[1:58:24] Listen, have you failed? Have you failed
[1:58:26] big time? Were you worthy of death?
[1:58:32] But we're part of Christ. Amen.
[1:58:36] Amen.
[1:58:40] So, Abra Sarah now she through this
[1:58:44] whole prophecy, she's looking at
[1:58:45] herself. That's it. She's looking at her
[1:58:48] abilities and her condition and she say
[1:58:50] there's no there's no way I can do this.
[1:58:52] There's no way that I'm included in
[1:58:54] this. Look at all my mistakes. Look at
[1:58:56] my failures. Look at my weakness. My
[1:58:58] milk veins are dried up. We've lived
[1:58:59] together so many years. I've never been
[1:59:01] able to conceive. We've never had a
[1:59:03] child. I'm getting older and older and
[1:59:04] now this can't happen. And so she's not
[1:59:07] doubting the word. She's not doub uh she
[1:59:10] is doubting the word, but she's not
[1:59:12] doubting the word. That's right. Amen.
[1:59:15] That's it. She's not doubting that the
[1:59:16] word's true, but she's doubting that she
[1:59:18] can do it. And now it gets to the point
[1:59:19] where Abraham can't do it. And now God
[1:59:21] visits and he says, "Don't worry. I'm
[1:59:23] going to restore. I will restore, sayeth
[1:59:25] the Lord, all the years that the
[1:59:27] cankerworm and the palmer and the
[1:59:28] caterpillar and the locust have eaten. I
[1:59:30] will restore back to the faith of the
[1:59:33] fathers. In the seventh age, there's a
[1:59:34] restoration work bringing back Abraham
[1:59:37] and Sarah to the original condition they
[1:59:40] were at Pentecost where the word was
[1:59:42] fresh and the bride was fresh and
[1:59:44] everything was fresh and new. Amen.
[1:59:47] And in the seventh age, he brought them
[1:59:49] back. Remember, brother Bam said he
[1:59:51] lived with her since she was about 16
[1:59:53] years old. They lived as husband and
[1:59:54] wife. And God comes on the scene and
[1:59:56] says, "I will restore." Amen. Amen.
[1:59:59] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:00:02] Amen.
[2:00:05] So, we learned something. But, Brother
[2:00:07] Bam said why he couldn't kill her?
[2:00:08] Because she's part of Abraham. So, if
[2:00:10] she's part of Abraham, she's part of the
[2:00:12] prophecy. That's right. Amen. So, she
[2:00:15] must be part of the fulfillment of the
[2:00:16] prophecy. That's right. Amen. That's
[2:00:18] right. So, now they come from this
[2:00:22] scene. They go down to Guerrar and 19.
[2:00:25] And then 19 is where brother said uh uh
[2:00:28] Bimc wants her for a wife and he can
[2:00:30] have any fair young virgin he wants but
[2:00:32] he said he wants his 80year-old grandma.
[2:00:34] And so he starts to show us by this
[2:00:36] scripture they've already received the
[2:00:37] body change which mean they already went
[2:00:40] back the vitality and vigor of the word
[2:00:42] has come back out of the dark age has
[2:00:44] been restored by a prophetic message and
[2:00:46] now the church goes back to its virgin
[2:00:48] condition as it first was back. Amen.
[2:00:51] Coming out of in the book of acts coming
[2:00:53] out of the upper room. That's right.
[2:01:02] But through all that, there's still no
[2:01:04] baby. That's right.
[2:01:08] Remember when they were fresh and young
[2:01:10] and 16 years old, they had no baby.
[2:01:13] Right. That's it. And the problem wasn't
[2:01:15] with the word because Abraham could
[2:01:17] reproduce.
[2:01:19] The problem was with the church. That's
[2:01:21] right.
[2:01:23] But Sarah, she couldn't That's it.
[2:01:25] conceive. Yeah. Glory. That's good.
[2:01:28] That's it. But let's go to chapter 21.
[2:01:34] That's it. There you are. Genesis
[2:01:36] chapter 21 verse
[2:01:38] one. And the Lord visited Sarah. There
[2:01:43] you are.
[2:01:45] As he had said. Amen.
[2:01:48] When did he say? He said, "At the
[2:01:52] appointed time, there you are. I will
[2:01:55] restore to you."
[2:01:58] Yes.
[2:02:00] This time he didn't come to Abraham. No.
[2:02:03] Right. Right. This time he came to
[2:02:05] Sarah.
[2:02:09] That's right. Hallelujah. And the Lord
[2:02:11] visited Sarah. This is the first time
[2:02:15] that he comes to her. That's it.
[2:02:18] after the seventh visit. And the seventh
[2:02:20] visitation was about her. But this time
[2:02:23] he comes to her. That's it. And the Lord
[2:02:26] visited Sarah as he had said. And the
[2:02:28] Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
[2:02:30] For Sarah conceived. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:02:34] That's right. And bare Abraham a son in
[2:02:35] his old age at the set time of which God
[2:02:38] had spoken to him. Right there.
[2:02:42] We don't fully know what happened in
[2:02:44] this visitation.
[2:02:46] When Abraham had visitations before, you
[2:02:49] couldn't mark it with something. God
[2:02:51] said, "Leave your kinfolk. Leave all
[2:02:53] this." We got it recorded in the Bible.
[2:02:55] He come down as a pillar of fire,
[2:02:57] smoking furnace between the two pieces
[2:02:59] of animal that Abraham has had slain. He
[2:03:02] had there was every visitation. There
[2:03:04] was details about the visitation. Amen.
[2:03:07] That you could mark and discuss and go
[2:03:09] over. But in this one, it's in silence.
[2:03:13] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's it.
[2:03:16] Hallelujah. Nothing. That's it. There's
[2:03:18] nothing you can say. That's right. What
[2:03:20] happened? Did he talk to her? Did he
[2:03:23] appear? Did she hear something? Did she
[2:03:26] see something? Did she feel something?
[2:03:29] There's nothing. It's completely silent.
[2:03:32] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. All we know is
[2:03:36] he had visited her according to what he
[2:03:38] had said. And he had did unto her
[2:03:41] according to what he promised. And she
[2:03:43] conceived. Amen. And I want you to look
[2:03:46] with me. Go turn with me to Hebrews
[2:03:48] chapter
[2:03:49] 11. And we're going to understand what
[2:03:51] happened in this visitation to Sarah.
[2:03:57] Remember Hebrews 11 is the heroes of
[2:04:00] faith chapter
[2:04:02] and it talks about everything that
[2:04:03] everybody did and Enoch and and and a uh
[2:04:06] Abel and all of these great heroes of
[2:04:09] faith. But you know Sarah's one of the
[2:04:11] heroes of faith. Amen. Amen. And it said
[2:04:13] in Hebrews 11, through faith
[2:04:17] also Sarah herself received strength to
[2:04:20] conceive seed
[2:04:22] and was delivered of child when she was
[2:04:24] past age because she judged him faithful
[2:04:26] who promised. Amen. How was it she was
[2:04:29] able to conceive seed? She never was
[2:04:31] able to conceive seed before. All the
[2:04:33] time she lived with him, couldn't
[2:04:35] conceive. Turned back young, couldn't
[2:04:36] conceive. But in this private visitation
[2:04:39] between just her and the Lord that was
[2:04:41] in secret, something happened to her to
[2:04:44] quicken her faith.
[2:04:46] Because by faith, through faith. Amen.
[2:04:49] Listen. Read it. Through faith, not
[2:04:53] something magical God did to her body.
[2:04:55] Not some. It was her faith. God did
[2:04:58] something to quicken her faith. God did
[2:05:00] something to help her. She was
[2:05:02] struggling with faith all along. What
[2:05:04] was the faith she was struggling with?
[2:05:06] the fact that she was part of the
[2:05:08] promise. So God comes to her in a
[2:05:11] private visitation with nobody else
[2:05:13] included and utter silence and total
[2:05:15] secret. He comes just to Sarah. And that
[2:05:18] visitation does something for Sarah's
[2:05:20] faith.
[2:05:22] And through faith, she receives the
[2:05:24] strength that conceives.
[2:05:26] That's right. Amen. Oh, this whole thing
[2:05:28] is by faith. That's right. That's it.
[2:05:31] That's
[2:05:32] right. Oh.
[2:05:36] That private visitation reminds me of
[2:05:39] the third pool vision. That's it. That's
[2:05:42] what it is. Brother Brandham, now he's
[2:05:45] talking about the third pool vision. And
[2:05:47] so many people call it the tent vision.
[2:05:49] That's fine. It ends in a tent, but I
[2:05:51] call it the fishing vision because I
[2:05:53] like to fish. It starts off fishing.
[2:05:56] Trying to catch the rainbow trout, the
[2:05:58] covenant fish that are in the deep
[2:05:59] water. Amen. The target species is the
[2:06:03] elect of God. Amen. That's right. And
[2:06:05] this whole thing, there's a target
[2:06:07] species, and the target species is
[2:06:09] rainbow. Amen. Amen. Covenant. Rainbow
[2:06:13] is a sign of the covenant, the promise
[2:06:14] that God will keep. And they're covenant
[2:06:16] fish. And they're big ones. Amen.
[2:06:19] Trophies,
[2:06:21] elects and daughters of God. And where
[2:06:23] are they? Out in the deep water.
[2:06:26] Hallelujah. Not in the shallows around
[2:06:28] the bank, but out in the deep water. And
[2:06:30] that's the target. And brother Brandham
[2:06:32] says in his heart, "I think I can catch
[2:06:34] those." Yeah. Come on.
[2:06:38] I love that so much because God would
[2:06:41] allow this man
[2:06:44] to go up on the river of no return.
[2:06:46] Uhhuh. And catch the world record.
[2:06:50] That's right. Rainbow trout.
[2:06:54] Think about that, friends. What is he
[2:06:56] going? He's confirming this man knows
[2:06:59] how to catch the covenant fish.
[2:07:01] Hallelujah.
[2:07:03] God proved it to the whole world. Amen.
[2:07:06] By allowing him to catch the world
[2:07:08] record rainbow trout. Amen.
[2:07:11] Amen. Amen. But how was he going to
[2:07:14] catch him? Not in the first pool, not in
[2:07:18] the second pool, but in the third pool.
[2:07:20] That's right. He said the third pull
[2:07:22] will get it and that'll hook them and
[2:07:25] bring them all the way in. That's right.
[2:07:27] And brother Bam calls the third pull.
[2:07:28] Listen, the third bowl is an exhaustive
[2:07:30] subject and we're not going to even
[2:07:31] attempt to exhaust it. But but he says
[2:07:33] it's the opening of the word and there's
[2:07:34] so many things that are attached to it.
[2:07:36] But when he has this vision, he ends in
[2:07:37] a tent and he's in the tent overlooking
[2:07:40] this cathedral-like tent and then there
[2:07:41] there's a little box and there's a line
[2:07:43] coming out one side and going around the
[2:07:45] block and there's people who have all
[2:07:47] kinds of afflictions on stretchers and
[2:07:48] cotss and and wheelchairs and they're
[2:07:50] all waiting to go in and he's up above
[2:07:52] it and there's a voice speaking to him
[2:07:54] and he says, "I'll meet you in there."
[2:07:55] And he sees the pillar of fire go down
[2:07:57] and the pillar of fire go down into that
[2:07:59] box. Amen. And and and brother
[2:08:01] Brandham's not down in there. He's over
[2:08:03] top looking down in. And he's watching
[2:08:05] people go in one at a time. Amen. One at
[2:08:09] a time. One by one. And there's somebody
[2:08:12] on the outside that's recording what
[2:08:14] comes out on the other side. And and
[2:08:16] those who were in wheelchairs or in CS,
[2:08:18] they come out pushing their CS, pushing
[2:08:20] their wheelchairs. They're made
[2:08:21] completely whole. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[2:08:25] Lord. And they asked him, "What happened
[2:08:27] to you in that room?" And they said, "I
[2:08:28] don't know. I can't explain it." It was
[2:08:32] total silence. There's nothing I can
[2:08:34] share with you. There's nothing you can
[2:08:36] repeat to get the results I got. This
[2:08:38] isn't repeatable. The only thing I know
[2:08:41] is if you go in there wounded,
[2:08:43] afflicted, tormented, battered, and
[2:08:46] beaten, and broken, you will come out
[2:08:48] the other side
[2:08:50] home. And how did it happen? And I don't
[2:08:53] know what took place. I don't know. You
[2:08:56] see, God under this third pull, he made
[2:08:58] it so good that he didn't make it
[2:08:59] something repeatable because we'd have
[2:09:01] copycats all over the world. But you
[2:09:03] can't copycat this
[2:09:05] meeting. It's an individual one at a
[2:09:08] time, not a church, not a group, not a
[2:09:11] form, not a ritual, but there's one
[2:09:14] person who will walk. And what we only
[2:09:16] know, listen, the vision doesn't tell us
[2:09:18] everything. There's only one thing we
[2:09:20] know that was in that box besides the
[2:09:21] person and that was the pillar of fire.
[2:09:24] And what is the pillar of fire? The
[2:09:26] pillar of fire is the life of this
[2:09:29] message.
[2:09:31] Not the documents, not the tapes, not
[2:09:34] the books, but the life force behind the
[2:09:37] word. The life of the word was in that
[2:09:39] room. Amen. And when we go by
[2:09:41] individuals, don't think natural,
[2:09:43] friends. This isn't natural.
[2:09:46] Brother Brenham wrestled with that.
[2:09:47] Maybe I'll have a tent. One day I'm
[2:09:49] going to have a tent. He's thinking
[2:09:50] natural. It never happened. Showing that
[2:09:52] it was never a natural fulfillment. This
[2:09:54] is a spiritual fulfillment.
[2:09:58] So spiritually, we were afflicted. We
[2:10:01] were wounded. We were lame. We were
[2:10:02] blind. We were tormented. We had
[2:10:05] denominations and doctrines and all
[2:10:06] kinds of problems that have broke us
[2:10:08] down spiritually and we weren't whole
[2:10:10] and we weren't right and we weren't
[2:10:12] sound. But one by one we come in contact
[2:10:15] with the life of the third
[2:10:18] pull. The lifegiver to the word. The
[2:10:21] life of the word. The person of the word
[2:10:25] himself. Not the baptism of the Holy
[2:10:27] Ghost. The person of the Holy Ghost.
[2:10:32] And when we come in contact with that,
[2:10:34] we come out the other side. Hey, listen.
[2:10:36] This isn't physical. You still get old.
[2:10:38] You still have pain. Your ears start
[2:10:40] going. Your eyesight start going. But
[2:10:42] something changes spiritually in your
[2:10:46] soul. That's it. And you've been made
[2:10:49] whole.
[2:10:51] You know where you came from. You know
[2:10:53] your identification. You know who you're
[2:10:55] married to. You know what's going on.
[2:10:57] And you know where you're going.
[2:11:01] The affliction is over with.
[2:11:06] That's right. We're not limping. We're
[2:11:08] not wheelchair bound. We're not on IVs
[2:11:11] anymore spiritually. We've been
[2:11:12] restored.
[2:11:16] Hallelujah.
[2:11:18] [Applause]
[2:11:21] Praise the Lord. What happened? Yes,
[2:11:23] sir.
[2:11:25] Can't explain it.
[2:11:29] I was listening to tapes
[2:11:32] going to service.
[2:11:35] Is there a formula to it, Jack? Can you
[2:11:37] give me the formula?
[2:11:40] Yes sir.
[2:11:42] Many people have tried to repeat. That's
[2:11:44] it.
[2:11:45] I went to the altar and cried till
[2:11:47] something changes. People come to the
[2:11:48] altar and cry. Nothing changes.
[2:11:52] I did this. I did this. And this isn't
[2:11:54] repeatable.
[2:11:56] This isn't copy. You can't. There's no
[2:11:58] copying this.
[2:12:01] This is to the individual.
[2:12:06] We're not going in as groups.
[2:12:09] Sarah was all alone.
[2:12:12] But what happened to her was this
[2:12:14] private visitation gave her faith
[2:12:18] to conceive on the promised word.
[2:12:23] And after that private meeting, guess
[2:12:25] what?
[2:12:27] Now the word was in her
[2:12:32] because it gave her faith to conceive on
[2:12:35] the word and the promised word. Amen.
[2:12:38] Was that Abraham shall have a seed and
[2:12:40] that seed came unto her and she
[2:12:42] conceived on the seed and now she's
[2:12:45] carrying the promised seed word inside
[2:12:48] her womb.
[2:12:50] Where is the word? In her. Where's the
[2:12:53] word? In Sarah.
[2:12:54] [Applause]
[2:12:56] Amen.
[2:13:01] Amen. Amen.
[2:13:04] She saying, "I couldn't do it. I can't
[2:13:05] do it. I'm too old. I can't." And he he
[2:13:08] by the word fixed everything.
[2:13:12] Listen friends, he by the watering of
[2:13:13] the word and the restoration of this
[2:13:15] word, he has fixed everything. Your
[2:13:17] unworthiness, your inability, your
[2:13:20] brokenness. He's healed it all.
[2:13:24] And he's given you an identity and he's
[2:13:26] changed your name and he's visited you
[2:13:28] so that you can believe I'm one of them.
[2:13:31] It's me. It's me. Oh, I love that
[2:13:34] special when the brother say, "Mama,
[2:13:35] it's me." Amen. You walked up. Now, we
[2:13:38] heard this message, Brother Brandon's
[2:13:39] preaching. When I first come to the
[2:13:41] message, I was mesmerized that God could
[2:13:43] do a work through a man like that. I was
[2:13:45] blown away that he could hear from God.
[2:13:47] He could speak to people. Amen. That
[2:13:49] what God had told him is accurate as the
[2:13:51] accurate could be. He could turn his
[2:13:52] back to crowds. He could he could make
[2:13:54] his uh uh knife appear in his pocket.
[2:13:59] Like, I'm absolutely mesmerized that God
[2:14:01] could do this. And then then I went from
[2:14:03] being mesmerized at the miracles. Then I
[2:14:04] got mesmerized at all the truths.
[2:14:08] There you go. Tied together everything,
[2:14:10] all the loose ends that was left and
[2:14:12] brought us back to the original teaching
[2:14:14] of the Bible. And it all was seamless
[2:14:15] and perfect. And I got so excited about
[2:14:18] all of this stuff. But there was one
[2:14:19] part of the message I was missing. I was
[2:14:22] missing the fact that I am part of the
[2:14:23] prophecy.
[2:14:26] I was looking at the prophet. That's the
[2:14:28] word. I was looking at the restoration.
[2:14:30] That's the word. That's everything. The
[2:14:32] opening of the seals. That's the word.
[2:14:33] Everything is happening according to the
[2:14:35] word. But there was one part that I was
[2:14:38] missing. And that missing part, Amen,
[2:14:40] come later in the message when I
[2:14:42] realized it's me, mama. That's what he's
[2:14:45] talking about. That man's talking about
[2:14:47] me.
[2:14:51] That message is about me. I told the
[2:14:54] church, I don't want to believe the
[2:14:55] message. I want to be the message.
[2:15:00] The message, amen, is God in the form of
[2:15:03] his bride manifesting his original life
[2:15:06] through a many membered body. I don't
[2:15:08] want to just believe that. I want to be
[2:15:10] part of that. I want to manifest that.
[2:15:16] [Music]
[2:15:23] Now, now the
[2:15:25] word is in Sarah.
[2:15:29] That's it.
[2:15:31] [Applause]
[2:15:33] Reminds me of Ruth and Boaz. This is
[2:15:35] another redemption story.
[2:15:37] Boaz is the redeemer, the goal. And
[2:15:41] Naomi needs redeemed. They've lost
[2:15:42] everything. And now Ruth, the gentile
[2:15:44] bride. The only way redemption can come
[2:15:47] to pass is if she listens to Naomi, the
[2:15:50] old word. That's it. To give her the
[2:15:52] word, gives her instructions on how to
[2:15:53] approach the redeemer.
[2:15:56] And the proper approach is through
[2:15:58] humility
[2:16:01] because she has to lay down her life at
[2:16:03] his feet and surrender all that she is
[2:16:05] to him. It's the only way we can get
[2:16:07] redemption through an absolute
[2:16:09] surrender. Amen. So she lays herself
[2:16:11] down at his
[2:16:13] feet and in the night he wakes up and
[2:16:16] what is this and who is this? And she
[2:16:17] tells him the purpose and he says you're
[2:16:20] virtuous
[2:16:22] because this has nothing to do with
[2:16:24] lust. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. This isn't
[2:16:28] lust. This isn't selfish desire. This is
[2:16:31] all about redemption. You're willing to
[2:16:33] give yourself up. He says, "Because you
[2:16:35] didn't seek after young men, rich or
[2:16:38] poor. You never sought after the young.
[2:16:40] You came to an old man. You came back to
[2:16:42] the old way. You came back to the
[2:16:44] original word. You came back to the
[2:16:46] redeemer. You weren't looking for new
[2:16:48] things and exciting things. You were
[2:16:50] willing to give yourself up. Amen.
[2:16:53] That's good. Amen. Amen. So to confirm
[2:16:57] the promise that he'll redeem her, he
[2:17:00] gives her six measures.
[2:17:03] Of seed. Uhhuh.
[2:17:07] Reminds me of the six seals. Yeah,
[2:17:10] that's right. Something you could weigh,
[2:17:13] something you can measure, something you
[2:17:14] look at, something you can count,
[2:17:15] something you could touch. But seven's
[2:17:18] the number of completion. That's it.
[2:17:20] That's right. So why did he give her six
[2:17:22] measures?
[2:17:24] Why did he leave it o why did he leave
[2:17:26] it open? And the six he gave her were
[2:17:28] measurable. You could take them out and
[2:17:30] show them. You can say a white horse
[2:17:31] rider means an antichrist spirit. Amen.
[2:17:34] And a red horse begins to conquer and
[2:17:36] fight. You can take it out and put your
[2:17:38] hands to the grain. You could show it to
[2:17:39] other people. You could weigh it. But
[2:17:42] the seventh measure of seed
[2:17:46] was sown in secret. That's right. That's
[2:17:49] right. in a private meeting with only
[2:17:52] the redeemer and his bride.
[2:17:55] Nobody could see it, nobody could weigh
[2:17:57] it, nobody could measure it, nobody
[2:17:59] could analyze it.
[2:18:02] After he'd finished the work of
[2:18:03] redemption, he came and took his bride
[2:18:05] and he swed his seed into Ruth. And now
[2:18:08] what was in Ruth?
[2:18:11] That's it. That's right.
[2:18:14] Ruth needed redemption.
[2:18:17] She needed a redeemer. That's right.
[2:18:19] Boaz was the redeemer.
[2:18:21] But the minute he swed that seed into
[2:18:24] Ruth, now you know what's in Ruth.
[2:18:27] That's it. The redeemer. That's right.
[2:18:31] Because this child would redeem back. He
[2:18:33] would be the possessor of everything
[2:18:35] that was Boaz. He would own all the
[2:18:37] property. He would have the restoration
[2:18:39] of everything. Now, amen. Boaz is an old
[2:18:42] man. We don't hear Boaz mentioned
[2:18:43] anymore. But it doesn't matter anymore
[2:18:45] because now the redeemer's inside of
[2:18:47] her. She's carrying the Lord of the
[2:18:49] harvest, the redeemer, the owner of it
[2:18:52] all, the inheritor of everything is in
[2:18:55] her.
[2:18:57] The seventh measure of seed measured in
[2:19:00] secret where nobody could watch, nobody
[2:19:02] could see.
[2:19:05] Lord,
[2:19:07] where's the seventh seal been swed?
[2:19:10] That's it. That's right.
[2:19:13] In silence, in secret. Amen. the third
[2:19:17] pole in the little room. Brother
[2:19:20] Brandham's in Sabino Canyon in Sabino
[2:19:22] Canyon. He puts his hands up and a sword
[2:19:23] strikes his hand and he's told that's
[2:19:25] the sword of the king. And he goes
[2:19:26] through all this and he finds out that's
[2:19:28] the king's sword. And he said it's the
[2:19:30] word coming into the hand and it's the
[2:19:32] word he come back and preached. And he
[2:19:34] says when it hits him, he says, "This is
[2:19:38] your third pool." That's right. When he
[2:19:41] saw the tent vision and he saw the Lord,
[2:19:43] he said, "This will be your third pool."
[2:19:45] Amen. But then the sword in the hand
[2:19:47] says this is your third pull. He says
[2:19:50] the opening of the word. So now whatever
[2:19:53] that was in the tent and whatever this
[2:19:55] is in the hand is the same thing.
[2:19:59] So what is it? It's Christ the word
[2:20:02] coming back to the church and she can go
[2:20:05] in a private meeting and meet the life
[2:20:07] of that word.
[2:20:09] Hallelujah. That's right. Amen. Amen.
[2:20:12] And now Sarah has the promised word
[2:20:15] inside of her. When the angel Gabriel
[2:20:18] comes to Mary and says, "Behold, I
[2:20:21] highly favored." And she's troubled in
[2:20:23] her mind. We talked about this
[2:20:24] yesterday. But all of a sudden, she
[2:20:26] says, "Be it unto me." What? What? What
[2:20:28] accomplished the work? Faith.
[2:20:30] She believed. He said, "This will happen
[2:20:32] because she believed." Amen. Amen.
[2:20:34] Because she believed, now she conceived.
[2:20:37] Now she's carrying. Now, what is in her?
[2:20:39] Now, inside the virgin is the promised
[2:20:42] word.
[2:20:44] Amen. That's right. Thank you. That's
[2:20:46] right.
[2:20:49] Brother Beam said, "The word will be in
[2:20:51] the bride."
[2:20:53] And the mind of Christ and know what he
[2:20:54] wants done with them.
[2:20:57] He has swn the word into you. Amen.
[2:21:00] Amen. You have gone to the mighty angel
[2:21:03] in a private meeting and you were told
[2:21:05] to take the book and you had the
[2:21:07] boldness enough to go and go after this
[2:21:09] book knowing that you had rights to it
[2:21:11] now by marriage. And then he told you to
[2:21:13] eat the book. What is you doing?
[2:21:15] Receiving just like seed. This mystery
[2:21:17] of God, this seventh measure of seed, it
[2:21:19] was sown into your heart. And now where
[2:21:22] is the word? It's in you.
[2:21:26] Where is this book? Listen, if you think
[2:21:28] of the imagery of John now, John's
[2:21:30] handed a book. John eats the book. The
[2:21:32] question is, where's the book?
[2:21:35] Did we lose the book? I mean, who else
[2:21:37] can get the book? John ate the book. How
[2:21:39] could you listen? This is like your dog
[2:21:42] eating the homework. Like, where is it
[2:21:43] at?
[2:21:46] How could we lose the book? John eating
[2:21:49] the book was the security of the book.
[2:21:51] It wasn't lost. It found its home. It
[2:21:55] was now secure. Because the mystery of
[2:21:57] God is now in a people who's bringing
[2:22:00] forth the mystery life of Jesus Christ.
[2:22:05] Now the word is in his bride.
[2:22:11] Can you imagine where'd the book go? You
[2:22:15] imagine the angels in heaven.
[2:22:17] We've been looking at you hold this book
[2:22:19] for thousands of years. Then we saw you
[2:22:22] take the book and we all rejoice. You
[2:22:23] took a trip down the earth and you come
[2:22:25] back with no book. Where's that book?
[2:22:26] That's the most important document.
[2:22:28] Hallelujah. And all of heaven and earth.
[2:22:31] What did you do with the book? He said,
[2:22:33] I put it in safekeeping.
[2:22:35] [Applause]
[2:22:45] Let's go back to Genesis 21.
[2:22:57] Do you love this message?
[2:22:59] It's more than this natural life to me.
[2:23:02] Take my life, but don't take this word
[2:23:03] from me.
[2:23:09] Genesis
[2:23:13] 21 verse
[2:23:15] 8. And the child grew and was weaned.
[2:23:18] And Abraham made a feast, a great feast,
[2:23:21] the same day that Isaac was weaned. And
[2:23:23] Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian,
[2:23:25] which she had borne unto Abraham,
[2:23:26] mocking.
[2:23:28] Now the false church, the denominational
[2:23:30] systems, mocking,
[2:23:32] the promised word.
[2:23:35] And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the
[2:23:37] Egyptian, which she had born into Abram,
[2:23:38] mocking.
[2:23:40] Wherefore she said unto Abraham, cast
[2:23:42] out this bond woman and her son, for the
[2:23:46] son of the bond woman shall not be heir
[2:23:48] with my son, even Isaac. And the thing
[2:23:51] was very grievious unto Abraham.
[2:23:54] Abraham's sight because of his son.
[2:23:58] Listen, can you imagine
[2:24:01] Abraham? Abraham and he's went through
[2:24:04] so many things. But now there's Ishmael
[2:24:06] and now Isaac is weaned and now
[2:24:08] Ishmael's mocking Isaac and Sarah's
[2:24:11] upset and Sarah says, "Cast out the bond
[2:24:13] woman and her son for that bond son of
[2:24:14] the bond woman won't be heir with my
[2:24:16] son." Exactly. And now he's thinking,
[2:24:18] "What should I do?" Because the last
[2:24:20] time I listened to Sarah, we got Ishmael
[2:24:26] [Music]
[2:24:31] because it was the church's idea to
[2:24:33] hybrid the word. There you are. It was
[2:24:36] the church's idea to take another branch
[2:24:39] and tie it into the original vine and
[2:24:41] bring forth a perverted fruit.
[2:24:45] Amen. But God wanted the original branch
[2:24:47] and the original vine, which was Abraham
[2:24:48] and Sarah. Amen. Right. Cuz he said out
[2:24:52] of thy boughels. That's it. Said Eleazar
[2:24:56] Damascus is not going to be your heir.
[2:24:58] Out of thy boughels. Right. That's an
[2:25:01] interesting word. Boughs. It means nword
[2:25:02] parts. Do you know it can also mean
[2:25:05] womb. That's it.
[2:25:07] Exactly.
[2:25:10] Out of your womb. Yeah.
[2:25:13] Does Abraham have a womb? Yes.
[2:25:16] Hallelujah.
[2:25:18] Amen.
[2:25:20] Abraham and Sarah, were they two or were
[2:25:22] they one?
[2:25:24] Amen. So that means Abraham has a womb.
[2:25:27] That's right. A That's right. If
[2:25:31] Abraham's going to bring out of If God's
[2:25:33] going to bring out of Abraham's boughs a
[2:25:35] son, he's got to bring it out of his
[2:25:37] boughs, out of his inward parts, out of
[2:25:39] his womb. And his Abraham's womb was in
[2:25:42] Sarah.
[2:25:44] Where is Christ's womb?
[2:25:48] Where is he going to sew his seed? Where
[2:25:50] is he going to bring? Where is he going
[2:25:51] to reproduce himself? Because Adam the
[2:25:53] son was given a bride to reproduce
[2:25:55] himself
[2:26:00] out of thy boughs.
[2:26:02] Amen. So now the it's the church's idea,
[2:26:05] the hybrid, the word creating the
[2:26:07] denominational system of Ishmael. And
[2:26:09] now the woman says, "I'm done with that.
[2:26:11] You put it away. Not with my son." And
[2:26:12] he said, "What am I going to do?" So he
[2:26:14] go God God comes and rescues him. Verse
[2:26:17] 12. And God said unto Abraham, "Let it
[2:26:20] not be grievous in thy sight because of
[2:26:22] the lad and because of the bond woman,
[2:26:24] and all that Sarah has said unto thee,
[2:26:27] hearken unto her voice."
[2:26:30] For in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
[2:26:33] Amen. Amen.
[2:26:37] Amen. That's it. God said what she is
[2:26:42] saying is right. It's the truth. Amen.
[2:26:46] Because Sarah went through a
[2:26:47] transformation, got a name change, met
[2:26:49] God personally, got faith to conceive
[2:26:52] seed, and now she knows what the program
[2:26:54] is. And now she can say, "Listen, this
[2:26:57] bond woman, this whole thing is my
[2:26:59] fault. Amen. I is my idea to have
[2:27:01] denomination. I failed. I messed up. But
[2:27:03] you cast it out. I'm not going that way
[2:27:05] anymore. I'm not believing that way
[2:27:07] anymore. Now I want a separation. That
[2:27:10] old thinking, that old denomination, get
[2:27:12] it out of here because all I want is
[2:27:14] this son. Nothing will be heir with this
[2:27:17] word.
[2:27:19] [Applause]
[2:27:19] [Music]
[2:27:20] That's right. It's the promised son and
[2:27:23] the promised son only. That's right.
[2:27:26] That's right. But if you brothers in the
[2:27:29] back, if you could pull up Galatians 4
[2:27:30] for me. I won't take the time to turn
[2:27:32] there, but look at Galatians 4.
[2:27:35] Nevertheless, what saith the scripture?
[2:27:37] Yeah.
[2:27:39] Cast out the bomb woman and her son. For
[2:27:42] the son of the bomb woman shall be heir
[2:27:43] with the son.
[2:27:46] So the apostle Paul is quoting the
[2:27:50] scriptures. That's right.
[2:27:53] Where did the scriptures come from?
[2:27:57] From Sarah's mouth. What Sarah said was
[2:28:01] the word of God. What Sarah said was
[2:28:04] wrote down in scripture. Paul says, he
[2:28:07] didn't say, "Didn't Sarah say?" Paul
[2:28:09] says, "Does not scripture say?" That's
[2:28:12] right. That's it. Why? Because the word
[2:28:15] is in her and she knows what needs to be
[2:28:19] done with it.
[2:28:22] Praise the Lord. Praise be to God. I
[2:28:24] don't know of anywhere else in scripture
[2:28:26] where something a woman said is is is
[2:28:28] incorporated into canon as scripture.
[2:28:31] That's right. There you are. But here it
[2:28:33] is. There it is. Amen.
[2:28:36] Brother Brandham makes this statement
[2:28:38] and Christ is the mystery of God
[2:28:39] revealed. The new birth is Christ's a
[2:28:42] revelation. God has revealed to you this
[2:28:45] great mystery and that's a new birth.
[2:28:46] Now what are you going to do when you
[2:28:48] get all that group together where the
[2:28:50] revelation is perfectly in harmony and
[2:28:51] God expressing it through the word by
[2:28:53] the same actions, the same things that
[2:28:55] he did making the word manifest. Oh, if
[2:28:57] the church only knew its position,
[2:29:01] it will one day. Then the rapture will
[2:29:04] go when it knows what it is.
[2:29:08] Amen. You notice it doesn't say when it
[2:29:10] knows who it is. That's right.
[2:29:14] Because when you start to say when you
[2:29:15] know who you are, you automatically
[2:29:17] start thinking about who's. That's
[2:29:19] right. Different who's. But when you say
[2:29:21] what, the question is what is she?
[2:29:26] She is part of Christ. That's it. She's
[2:29:28] the manifestation of the hour. She's the
[2:29:30] word made flesh. She is him. That's
[2:29:34] exactly right, brother. That's true.
[2:29:37] Let's go to Romans 16:20.
[2:29:42] Romans 16:20. And the God of peace shall
[2:29:45] bruise Satan under your feet
[2:29:48] shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus
[2:29:50] Christ be with you. Amen. Paul's writing
[2:29:53] to the book of Romans. He says, "Guess
[2:29:54] what's going to happen? The God of peace
[2:29:57] is going to bruise Satan." This word
[2:30:00] bruise isn't like you bump yourself and
[2:30:01] get a bruise. This word bruise means to
[2:30:03] crush. That's right.
[2:30:05] And the God of peace is going to crush
[2:30:07] Satan. So the question is, who's
[2:30:09] crushing who? That's it. That's it.
[2:30:13] You're not crushing anybody. No.
[2:30:17] The God of peace is crushing. Yeah,
[2:30:22] it's not not me and you. We're not doing
[2:30:25] anything, but the God of peace is going
[2:30:27] to bruise Satan. But where is he going
[2:30:30] to bruise him? Under your feet.
[2:30:34] It's not you crushing him under your
[2:30:36] feet. It's him crushing him under your
[2:30:38] feet. Because it's not a life we live.
[2:30:41] It's a life we we give to him. A life
[2:30:43] comes in us and lives through us. It's
[2:30:45] Christ in bride form. It's not you and
[2:30:47] I. It's not this thing here or this
[2:30:49] thing here, but there's another life
[2:30:51] inside that's working. And he, the God
[2:30:53] of peace, shall bruise Satan under your
[2:30:56] feet. It's not what you're going to do
[2:30:57] and what you say and what you think and
[2:30:59] how bold you get. It's God working
[2:31:01] through you.
[2:31:03] Amen. That's right. And where is Satan
[2:31:06] going to be bruised in the end time?
[2:31:08] Under the feet of the church. Amen. But
[2:31:11] it's not going to be her effort. It's
[2:31:12] going to be his. Amen. Amen. Beautiful.
[2:31:15] That's right. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:31:18] Amen.
[2:31:21] Oh, praise God.
[2:31:24] We're just going to have to wind down,
[2:31:27] friends, in the Leodysian church
[2:31:33] age. He says, "Yes, sir. The church is
[2:31:35] no longer the mouthpiece of God. It is
[2:31:39] its own mouthpiece.
[2:31:41] So God is turning on her and he will
[2:31:42] confound her through the prophet and the
[2:31:44] bride. For the voice of God will be in
[2:31:48] her. Amen.
[2:31:50] Amen. Was it in Sarah? Yes. Yes, sir.
[2:31:54] Amen.
[2:31:56] Yes, it is. For it says in the last
[2:31:58] chapter of Revelation verse 17, the
[2:32:00] spirit and the bride. Amen. Say, come.
[2:32:02] Amen. Once more, the world will hear
[2:32:05] direct from God as at Pentecost. But of
[2:32:06] course, that word bride will be
[2:32:08] repudiated as in the first age. When the
[2:32:11] bride says come, I want you to look at
[2:32:14] that terminology. The spirit and the
[2:32:17] bride say come. So the bride's not at
[2:32:19] this alone. Oh, that's right. It's the
[2:32:22] spirit of the word that's with her.
[2:32:23] Amen. That's speaking through her. Amen.
[2:32:26] So the spirit and the bride say come.
[2:32:28] But you know what the spirit and the
[2:32:29] bride don't say? They don't say go.
[2:32:32] They say come. That's right. Amen.
[2:32:35] That means whatever position the bride's
[2:32:38] in is the place you need to come to.
[2:32:42] That's it. And they're calling to come
[2:32:43] to drink of the water of life freely.
[2:32:46] That means the bride must be drinking
[2:32:48] from the water of life. She must be at
[2:32:50] the fountain of life. She must be there
[2:32:53] because she's bidding them to come. Come
[2:32:55] and drink. Come who's thirsty. Come to
[2:32:57] the water of life. Amen. Come. I've
[2:33:00] already come. Now I'm calling to you to
[2:33:02] come. Amen. That's it. Not sending you
[2:33:05] somewhere else, but calling you to come
[2:33:07] drink what I've drunk. Receive what I've
[2:33:09] received. Amen. I can't do it for you.
[2:33:12] Nobody else can do it for you, but come
[2:33:14] and drink. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:33:18] That's right. Brother Brand was asked,
[2:33:20] "Would the bride of Christ would the
[2:33:21] bride of Christ have a ministry before
[2:33:23] the rapture?" Said, "Sure. That's what's
[2:33:25] going on right now."
[2:33:27] The bride of Christ certainly, it's the
[2:33:29] message of the hour. The bride of
[2:33:30] Christ. Sure. She's consisted of
[2:33:31] apostles, prophets, teachers,
[2:33:33] evangelists, and pastors. Is that right?
[2:33:35] That's the bride of Christ. Sure, she's
[2:33:37] got a ministry, a great ministry. It's
[2:33:39] the ministry of the hour. It'll be so
[2:33:42] humble. Amen.
[2:33:46] I want to read I want to leave you with
[2:33:47] this last quote. This is the last thing
[2:33:49] I'd like to read to you out of
[2:33:51] Revelation chapter 4, part
[2:33:53] three. So, nowadays they're so well we
[2:33:55] don't believe in and saying hell in the
[2:33:57] pulpit. Oh, mercy blah. I love how he
[2:34:00] says that we need men of God who won't
[2:34:02] hold back. Now, everybody can't be a
[2:34:06] preacher,
[2:34:08] but you got a voice. Amen. Will the
[2:34:11] bride have a ministry in the end time?
[2:34:13] He he lists the five-fold ministry. And
[2:34:15] they are they're calling out the message
[2:34:17] of the hour. But that doesn't exclude
[2:34:20] others that are not in the five-fold
[2:34:21] ministry. That's right. That's right.
[2:34:24] Because his voice will be in the bride.
[2:34:26] Amen. Why? Because his word is in her.
[2:34:28] That's it. Because the word is in the
[2:34:30] bride, in the mind of Christ, he knows
[2:34:31] what he wants done with it. Amen. But
[2:34:34] you got a voice. And if you can't preach
[2:34:36] the people a sermon, if you're a
[2:34:38] preacher, you're called to the pulpit to
[2:34:40] preach. If you're not, you're still a
[2:34:42] preacher. Amen.
[2:34:44] But live the people a sermon.
[2:34:48] Let your sermon be lived. And it's the
[2:34:52] voice of God that'll bring reproach to
[2:34:54] them who reject it. They say no one
[2:34:56] could put a finger on his or her life.
[2:34:58] They're sweet living. They If there ever
[2:35:00] was a man of God, it's that man or that
[2:35:02] woman. See, live your sermons. Don't try
[2:35:05] to preach them if you're not called to
[2:35:06] be a preacher. You'll get all mixed up
[2:35:08] anyhow and messed up and you'll get
[2:35:09] people tangled up. And you know what?
[2:35:11] You'll ruin them and yourself, too. Just
[2:35:13] live your sermon. The preacher's called
[2:35:16] to preach his and to live it, too. If
[2:35:18] you can't live it, then you stop
[2:35:19] preaching it. But you're supposed to
[2:35:20] live your sermons. All right. Here was
[2:35:23] voices. And he's talking about Amen.
[2:35:25] He's talking about when the throne room
[2:35:26] in heaven is open, out came lightnings
[2:35:28] and thunders and voices. Amen. All
[2:35:31] right. There was voices. Oh, how we need
[2:35:33] in Jefferson uh Jeffersonville thousands
[2:35:36] of lived voices.
[2:35:39] The thunder of God thundering out in
[2:35:41] sweetness and holiness, purity,
[2:35:44] undefiled lives walking around in the
[2:35:46] earth today without a blemish. Yes, sir.
[2:35:49] Real Christians.
[2:35:51] That's the thunder against the enemy.
[2:35:54] The devil don't care how loud you can
[2:35:56] holler. The devil don't care how much
[2:35:57] you can jump or how much you can do this
[2:35:59] or shout. But what hurts the devil?
[2:36:02] Amen. Who's bruising who, where, what
[2:36:05] crushes the devil? What hurts the devil?
[2:36:07] What bruises the devil?
[2:36:11] That sanctified, holy life consecrated
[2:36:15] to God.
[2:36:17] Say anything to him, call him anything,
[2:36:19] just as sweet as it can be. And moving
[2:36:21] right on. Oh my. that throws him away.
[2:36:25] That's the thunder that shakes the
[2:36:27] devil. Hallelujah, Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:36:30] Hallelujah.
[2:36:36] Hallelujah.
[2:36:39] Where is the word? It's in the bride.
[2:36:43] She's the mouthpiece of God speaking
[2:36:44] out. But listen, that speaking out may
[2:36:47] not always be something you say. That's
[2:36:50] right. Amen. But your life is speaking.
[2:36:54] And that life is calling. Come. Amen.
[2:36:58] You can have this life, too. You can
[2:37:00] have this peace. You can have this
[2:37:02] wholeness. You can Amen. Don't think cuz
[2:37:05] you're not in the fifold ministry.
[2:37:06] You're excluded from the bride's
[2:37:07] ministry. Amen. You're still called to
[2:37:10] preach.
[2:37:12] And your life is preaching the sermon.
[2:37:14] Surrendered to him, consecrated, sold
[2:37:16] out completely, giving your body over
[2:37:18] like Ruth did to Boaz. giving out
[2:37:20] completely so that he can come and take
[2:37:22] over. Amen. So that living inside of
[2:37:25] your womb is the promised word and
[2:37:27] coming out of you is the word of God,
[2:37:29] the life of God. This word you've
[2:37:31] received living its own life. Amen.
[2:37:33] Amen.
[2:37:35] The New Testament begins with women.
[2:37:39] Amen. Because the Old Testament is male.
[2:37:41] The New Testament is female. Bride,
[2:37:43] groom, and bride, husband, and wife.
[2:37:44] Amen.
[2:37:46] The book of Luke, it starts off with an
[2:37:48] angel visiting a woman. That's it. Named
[2:37:51] Mary.
[2:37:52] And he gives her the promise word for
[2:37:54] her day. And she receives it. She
[2:37:57] believes it. And she's impregnated by
[2:37:59] the word.
[2:38:01] And she goes to another woman
[2:38:04] named Elizabeth.
[2:38:06] And that other woman is also carrying
[2:38:08] the word. Amen. That's right. Only the
[2:38:12] word she's carrying is dormant.
[2:38:16] It's dead. Hasn't moved yet. Hasn't
[2:38:19] kicked. Hasn't showed any sign of life.
[2:38:23] I absolutely love the Bible.
[2:38:26] Amen. So, here's the virgin that just
[2:38:29] received the promised word inside of
[2:38:30] her. She's been pregnantated by the
[2:38:33] spoken word and she's carrying the
[2:38:35] spoken word. She's carrying in within
[2:38:37] her the promise for her day. She's got
[2:38:40] it inside of her. And she goes to
[2:38:42] another woman who's also carrying part
[2:38:44] of the promised word for her day. But
[2:38:46] that promised word in her is dead.
[2:38:49] Amen. That's what the prophet tells us.
[2:38:53] But when Mary shows up and speaks her
[2:38:56] salutation and and brother Bam says
[2:38:58] names the name of Jesus Christ, all of a
[2:39:01] sudden the baby leapt inside of
[2:39:03] Elizabeth. Amen. And it started to leap
[2:39:06] for joy and Elizabeth was filled with
[2:39:08] the Holy Ghost. And what does Elizabeth
[2:39:10] do? She starts to prophesy.
[2:39:13] Amen. Amen. Amen. That's it. Said, "How
[2:39:16] is it the mother of my Lord has come
[2:39:18] unto me?" Amen. And as soon as she's
[2:39:20] done prophesying, what does Mary start
[2:39:22] doing? Prophesying. The Bible starts off
[2:39:25] with women who have a promised seed
[2:39:27] inside their womb. Prophesying.
[2:39:30] They're declaring the glories of the
[2:39:32] Lord. They're declaring the word for
[2:39:34] their day. They're declaring what is
[2:39:36] going on. It's a secret. Nobody else
[2:39:38] knows about it. What happened in Mary
[2:39:40] was a secret. But what happened in Mary
[2:39:42] when she come and named it to Elizabeth
[2:39:45] brought the word that was dead in
[2:39:46] Elizabeth and brought it to life.
[2:39:50] That word that you've received by your
[2:39:52] testimony has the power to bring another
[2:39:54] promised word in another womb to life.
[2:39:57] Another seed gene of God laying there
[2:40:00] dormant, unmoving. Hasn't kicked yet.
[2:40:02] Hasn't come to life yet. But all it
[2:40:04] takes is your testimony.
[2:40:07] And your testimony may not be words.
[2:40:09] Your testimony might be a life cuz
[2:40:11] testimony means a witness.
[2:40:15] That's right.
[2:40:19] It takes the life of Christ
[2:40:22] to bring life. Amen. Life to life, word
[2:40:26] to word. And now the word is in his
[2:40:30] bride. Amen. And she knows what he wants
[2:40:33] done with it. What does he want done
[2:40:35] with it? He wants it lived. Amen. That's
[2:40:37] right. Right there it is. He wants it on
[2:40:39] display. He wants a surrender to it. He
[2:40:42] wants it kept pure.
[2:40:44] That's right. And you with that word
[2:40:46] inside of you can come in contact with
[2:40:49] another woman with a word inside of her
[2:40:53] that hasn't leapt for joy yet, that
[2:40:56] hasn't showed signs of life. And just
[2:40:59] your life, your word, your testimony can
[2:41:03] cause it to spring to life. Amen.
[2:41:06] That's the truth. Amen. What do we need,
[2:41:10] brothers and sisters, to surrender to
[2:41:12] that life? That's right. That's it.
[2:41:16] Listen, I
[2:41:18] myself don't have any ability or power
[2:41:21] to bruise the devil. Not my human of
[2:41:24] Chad lamb that born of two people on
[2:41:27] earth.
[2:41:29] But he can. Amen.
[2:41:32] Amen. And he promised that he, the God
[2:41:34] of peace,
[2:41:36] is going to use this vessel and your
[2:41:39] vessel to crush the power of the devil.
[2:41:43] I say, God, if you got that kind of
[2:41:45] power and all you need is feet, here's
[2:41:47] some feet.
[2:41:49] If all you need is a body, here's a
[2:41:51] body. If all you're looking for is a
[2:41:53] vessel, if all you want is a womb, an
[2:41:55] empty womb, amen, with no other life in
[2:41:56] it. Here, I'm emptied out. I've poured
[2:41:58] out. Here it is, Lord. You can have this
[2:42:01] vessel to finish your work in this day.
[2:42:04] To bring life to others, to manifest, to
[2:42:06] live, to do all that you want to do.
[2:42:09] Here I am, Lord.
[2:42:11] Let's all stand together.
[2:42:14] Oh, God be praised. Amen.
[2:42:18] That's it. Amen. We talk about things
[2:42:20] and revelations that are beyond our
[2:42:22] understanding, beyond comprehension.
[2:42:24] They absolutely mesmerizes and thrill
[2:42:26] our soul. But when it boils down and
[2:42:28] comes down to it, what does God really
[2:42:30] want? He wants to live inside of you.
[2:42:34] He wants to finish the commission in
[2:42:36] you. He wants to destroy his enemy in
[2:42:38] you. He wants to complete the work in
[2:42:39] you. And what's that going to take from
[2:42:41] you? It's not going to take your effort,
[2:42:43] your ability, your mind, your strength.
[2:42:45] It's going to take a surrender. That's
[2:42:47] right. Humility. Brother said, "Don't
[2:42:49] look for big things." That's right.
[2:42:52] That's right. Don't try to produce
[2:42:54] something and be something and think
[2:42:56] it's got to look a certain way or be a
[2:42:58] certain thing and I'm not doing
[2:43:00] anything. Your very existence under the
[2:43:02] word and obedience to is doing something
[2:43:04] every day, every hour of the day. Your
[2:43:07] surrender to the word is having an
[2:43:09] effect. Just because you can't see
[2:43:11] anything tangible doesn't mean the
[2:43:12] spiritual world is not rocking because
[2:43:14] there's people who are taking him at his
[2:43:16] word.
[2:43:17] Amen. That's right. Don't doubt this
[2:43:20] message. Amen. Don't doubt the power of
[2:43:22] the message and don't doubt your part in
[2:43:24] the message.
[2:43:27] If you've never come to a place where
[2:43:30] you can say, "Mama, it's me."
[2:43:34] I invite you
[2:43:37] not to a church, not to a Bible study or
[2:43:40] to a me. I invite you to come to the
[2:43:43] pillar of fire.
[2:43:46] Amen. The life of the word. Come to
[2:43:48] Christ. Come to the mighty angel. Come
[2:43:51] to the revealer of the word. Come to the
[2:43:53] holder of the book. That's it. And say,
[2:43:56] "Give me the book."
[2:43:58] Amen. That's right.
[2:44:01] Come meet
[2:44:03] me in quiet and
[2:44:06] private and change me and give me faith
[2:44:10] to stay in my position.
[2:44:13] God bless you. We love you all. If we
[2:44:16] could just bow our heads, let's just
[2:44:18] pray. Lord Jesus, we thank you so much
[2:44:21] for your word,
[2:44:22] Lord. God, it is so beyond us,
[2:44:26] Lord. God, as we reflect on the things
[2:44:28] that you told us, God, how can it be,
[2:44:32] Lord? How can it be? But Lord, we know
[2:44:35] that it's
[2:44:36] true. Our hearts witness that it's true,
[2:44:39] but oh God, we're asking now that you
[2:44:41] would just absolutely take control of
[2:44:44] our vessels. God, we give to you
[2:44:47] everything that we have, Lord. And we
[2:44:48] believe that you've called us to be part
[2:44:50] of this end time
[2:44:52] manifestation. Not because we were
[2:44:54] worthy, not because we were good, not
[2:44:56] because we had done right, but simply
[2:44:58] because you slipped a wedding band on us
[2:45:00] of unmarited grace before the foundation
[2:45:03] of the world. And our hearts believe it,
[2:45:06] Lord, against all obstacles. We believe
[2:45:08] it, Lord. May you come and fill these
[2:45:11] vessels, Lord, and do your work in this
[2:45:13] end time through each of us. May we be
[2:45:15] surrendered like never before. And may
[2:45:18] we give our minds and our eyes and our
[2:45:20] ears and our thoughts and our mouth and
[2:45:22] everything over to you that you might
[2:45:25] finish your work. We love you. I thank
[2:45:27] you for these people. Oh, I pray you
[2:45:30] bless all your sheep in this place, the
[2:45:33] church, brother Ron, and all the
[2:45:35] ministry. Lord, just let your light
[2:45:36] shine from this place. We pray. May we
[2:45:39] go from here, Lord, forever grateful for
[2:45:41] your word. Yes. committed to
[2:45:44] consecrating ourselves aresh every day
[2:45:48] to your purpose. We love you. In Jesus
[2:45:50] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Can we sing
[2:45:54] that song, brethren?
[2:45:57] To glory. He's
[2:46:05] changing his lifelessness and he is
[2:46:10] perfect in me. The love of God showed to
[2:46:14] the
[2:46:17] world
[2:46:19] changing. He's changing me.
[2:46:24] Thanks to the
[2:46:30] heavenly
[2:46:34] perfect to the
[2:46:38] world. Amen. How many have enjoyed these
[2:46:41] meetings?
[2:46:43] [Applause]
[2:46:46] [Music]
[2:46:56] Yes, I don't know about you, but it's
[2:46:59] just been a jubilee to my spirit.
[2:47:03] Thank you, Lord. Knowing that the things
[2:47:05] that God's been showing me is showing
[2:47:07] these men
[2:47:09] doing the same thing. Why? Because this
[2:47:11] is not the orchestration of man.
[2:47:15] This is the Holy Spirit working among
[2:47:18] his bride. This was not skimm milk.
[2:47:21] If you're not eating on the word and you
[2:47:24] were expecting to be bottlefed and
[2:47:26] laying on of hands and faith towards
[2:47:29] God, hey, listen, then you missed it.
[2:47:32] This is to those who are full age,
[2:47:36] who have matured.
[2:47:38] Hallelujah.
[2:47:40] Who can take it? Somebody say, I can
[2:47:42] take it.
[2:47:44] [Music]
[2:47:46] Amen.
[2:47:47] The book is a person.
[2:47:55] That means he or she or they that
[2:47:59] receive the book.
[2:48:02] I've got to be the book. Amen.
[2:48:05] Hallelujah.
[2:48:07] He can only come to his own.
[2:48:10] Amen. What a wonderful time. Amen.
[2:48:15] Amen. The authority of revelation. Yeah.
[2:48:20] John ate the
[2:48:22] revelation. I've always said, "Where's
[2:48:25] the book?" after the book disappeared.
[2:48:34] I I start laughing because the devil, if
[2:48:36] he could get a hold of that book,
[2:48:39] he'd tear out pages, he'd do something.
[2:48:42] But where's the book?
[2:48:46] You're looking at it.
[2:48:49] It's in me.
[2:48:52] I'm now a living epistle.
[2:48:58] Hallelujah.
[2:49:02] Oh, hallelujah. I love that.
[2:49:08] Come here, Brother Jason. Come here,
[2:49:10] brother Chad. Stand up
[2:49:14] here. Stand one to my left, one to the
[2:49:16] right.
[2:49:19] [Music]
[2:49:23] Brother Brennham said one day after I'm
[2:49:28] gone, he says, "Why didn't they catch
[2:49:31] that picture?
[2:49:33] Why didn't they understand these
[2:49:35] prophecies?" He said, "God would not
[2:49:38] permit it to be done now, but one day
[2:49:41] after I'm gone, these young men
[2:49:46] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
[2:49:49] you. They'll begin to catch it.
[2:49:53] [Music]
[2:50:02] Shh. Don't tell nobody about it.
[2:50:05] It's in secret.
[2:50:07] I love it.
[2:50:10] And if you've been
[2:50:12] blessed this these meetings, what I'd
[2:50:15] like you to do, I want you to raise your
[2:50:17] hand. I want you to p put your blessings
[2:50:19] upon these men. Hallelujah. Okay?
[2:50:23] Because what we're going to bless them
[2:50:24] because everywhere they go, you preach
[2:50:26] this word. You tell that bride who she
[2:50:29] is. Don't tell her what she's not. Tell
[2:50:33] her what she is. Let her know her
[2:50:35] inheritance. Amen. Because when she sees
[2:50:38] the identity of the reflection of
[2:50:41] herself, that's me. How many of you can
[2:50:45] identify that's me? These men preached
[2:50:49] identification. And the whole time
[2:50:51] you're saying, "That's me. Yes, sir.
[2:50:53] That's me." Amen. Jason comes and
[2:50:55] preach, "That's me." Chad comes preach.
[2:50:58] That's me. That's me. That's me. That's
[2:51:00] me. Amen.
[2:51:03] You all, I want you to put your hands
[2:51:05] out right now. We're going to pray over
[2:51:07] these brethren. We're going to send them
[2:51:09] forth. We're going to ask a double
[2:51:11] portion upon their lives. Heavenly
[2:51:13] Father, as I lay my hands upon these
[2:51:16] young men, I ask you, Father, continue
[2:51:19] to take that word, put it in their
[2:51:21] mouths, let the thunder go forth. Let
[2:51:25] the lived lives. Let that mystery of God
[2:51:28] be finished. I thank you for their
[2:51:30] lives. I thank you for the testimony of
[2:51:33] Christ because it is the spirit of
[2:51:36] prophecy. Hallelujah. I bless them and I
[2:51:39] ask that you be with them, their
[2:51:41] churches, their
[2:51:43] ministries. Bless the souls of their
[2:51:45] feet and may they possess the gate of
[2:51:47] every enemy. We thank you. We praise
[2:51:50] you. We ask it for your glory in Jesus
[2:51:53] Christ's name.
[2:51:55] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:51:58] Amen.
[2:52:04] Hallelujah.
[2:52:06] Amen. Now, many of you have wanted to
[2:52:09] visit with them, shake their hand, get
[2:52:11] their card, get a photo, get a selfie.
[2:52:13] I'm going to give you an opportunity.
[2:52:15] I'm going to ask Brother Mike Elder, one
[2:52:17] of my deacons. Okay?
[2:52:19] uh you come get these men, take them in
[2:52:21] the back room, let them put their Bible
[2:52:23] down, let them put their iPad, different
[2:52:25] thing. Let them put it down and then
[2:52:27] they're going to go out front here and
[2:52:29] and don't none of you just take the
[2:52:32] whole time and uh with just one and in
[2:52:36] 20 30 minutes, hey, I got to tell you my

[2:52:53] of authority. You tell him to come, he

[2:52:58] comes. Take these brethren right now. Go
[2:53:00] ahead and go into my back room. Put
[2:53:02] their stuff there. We'll get their
[2:53:04] Bibles later and then just let them
[2:53:06] relax for a
[2:53:07] minute. I'll tell you, I've been
[2:53:10] blessed.
[2:53:12] I've been blessed beyond measure.
[2:53:14] [Music]
[2:53:21] [Music]
[2:53:21] [Applause]
[2:53:28] Hallelujah. All of those within the
[2:53:31] scripture, all of them, whether it's
[2:53:35] Abraham, Sarah, or any of them, whether
[2:53:37] it be
[2:53:39] Mary, whether it be Ruth, every one of
[2:53:43] them surrendering themselves. Amen.
[2:53:45] We're going to sing that song, I
[2:53:47] surrender.
[2:53:49] Because I feel that's a good note for us
[2:53:52] right now. We're surrendering ourselves.
[2:53:55] We're saying it's not us. I've tried and
[2:53:59] I like Abraham and Sarah when they were
[2:54:02] as good as dead. God said, Abraham, how
[2:54:06] about it? Ah, I've tried. I've tried and
[2:54:10] I'm dead. My wife's dead. He said, good.
[2:54:14] the Lord. Now, let me do it.
[2:54:20] If you've been trying and you've been
[2:54:22] trying and trying and trying and you
[2:54:24] say, "I'm just as good as dead." That's
[2:54:27] good.
[2:54:28] All you got to do is let him know
[2:54:31] because it's him going to fulfill the
[2:54:33] word, not you. It's not your works. You
[2:54:35] were predestinated.
[2:54:38] You were ordained.
[2:54:40] And the devil cannot stop you.
[2:54:43] Hallelujah. You will. Amen. All you got
[2:54:46] to do right now to activate it is
[2:54:49] surrender. Brother Robert, help me out.
[2:54:56] Yeah.
[2:54:58] Oh, I
[2:55:04] surrender. Oh, I surrender my life.

[2:55:43] one.
[2:55:47] Amen. I know
[2:55:50] Lord your plan for
[2:55:54] me
[2:55:55] is right.

[2:57:08] do. I
[2:57:14] surrender. Oh Lord, I surrender my
[2:57:20] Hallelujah.
[2:57:24] He talked about humility. Let's sing it
[2:57:27] this
[2:57:30] morning. Humble
[2:57:33] and broken, not
[2:57:37] come to
[2:57:40] you. Why do we go to him? We trust him.

[2:57:45] seeing and waiting to see what you will
[2:57:54] do. Oh Lord, you
[2:57:58] know just like Ruth we heard today. We
[2:58:02] are
[2:58:05] high coming to you again.

[2:59:20] away so you can. He talked about a life
[2:59:25] lived. Give myself away.
[2:59:30] [Music]
[2:59:32] I give myself
[2:59:35] away so you can
[2:59:39] use. Here I
[2:59:42] am and here I stand. Oh Lord, my
[2:59:49] life is in your
[2:59:53] hands. Lord, I
[2:59:58] longing to see. Oh,
[3:00:02] you're
[3:00:04] sight revealed in me. So I give myself
[3:00:12] away. Hallelujah.

[3:00:19] away so you can use me. I give myself
[3:00:30] away. I give myself
[3:00:33] [Music]

[3:00:42] prayer? Take my life.

[3:03:05] woman. We've been freed in Jesus Christ
[3:03:08] for a long time. I tried. You're
[3:03:11] dismissed. Go shake their hands and
[3:03:13] bless them. No lonely
[3:03:18] road. My heart was so
[3:03:22] heavy. Oh, I

[3:03:38] hour. I imagine that I found out he

[3:05:09] Amen. We'll ask our brother John Dubsky
[3:05:11] to lead us in a dismissal prayer from

[3:05:18] visitors that have come. God bless you.
[3:05:21] God bless everybody. Let's bow our
[3:05:23] heads. Our heavenly father, we are

[3:06:05] your goodness towards us. Lord, I just
[3:06:09] want to say Lord, thank you. Thank you.
[3:06:12] Thank you, Lord. I don't think I'll ever
[3:06:15] be the same after today. Lord, I feel
[3:06:18] I'm a new person, Lord, as I've been
[3:06:22] swept away, Lord, by your words of life
[3:06:25] and your words of love. I ask you to
[3:06:28] bless every single person under the
[3:06:32] sound of my voice. Lord, give them,
[3:06:35] Lord, mercy. Give them, Lord,
[3:06:38] protection. But most important, Lord,

[3:07:02] this all to you. We thank you. We praise
[3:07:05] you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:07:07] Christ.
[3:07:09] Amen. Amen. Amen. Thanks. Thanks. As we
[3:07:12] leave the building this morning, oh
[3:07:15] thanks, thanks.
[3:07:18] I give you
[3:07:20] thanks for
[3:07:22] all you have
[3:07:27] done and I am so
[3:07:30] blessed. My soul has found
