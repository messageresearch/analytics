[1:05:27] he that troubleth Israel and he answered
[1:05:30] I have not troubled Israel but thou and
[1:05:33] thy father's house in that you have
[1:05:35] forsaken the Commandments of the Lord
[1:05:37] and Hast followed after

[1:05:44] prophets of Baal 450 and the prophets of

[1:05:50] table and so Ahab sent unto all the
[1:05:52] children of Israel and gathered the
[1:05:55] prophets together un Mount Carmel and
[1:05:57] Elijah came unto all the people and said
[1:06:00] how long halt you between two
[1:06:03] opinions if the Lord be God follow him

[1:11:44] home amen listen we're we're we're we're
[1:11:47] dealing with a defeated enemy this
[1:11:48] morning you know it's a shame that the
[1:11:51] children of Israel would have got in a
[1:11:52] position that that God would have to
[1:11:54] call a
[1:11:56] showdown he'd have to call a showdown
[1:11:58] listen they were they were the called
[1:12:00] out they were the elect of that age and
[1:12:03] somehow they' got in this position that
[1:12:06] that they really they they they somehow
[1:12:08] had
[1:12:09] forgotten the the reality of what God
[1:12:12] had called them to am of their position
[1:12:15] in the word of of who they actually were
[1:12:17] that that Jehovah God would stand and
[1:12:20] fight their battles that that Jehovah
[1:12:22] God could be called on the scene to to
[1:12:24] heal their sick and to and to heal their
[1:12:26] Afflicted and somehow in me in in
[1:12:30] mingling with the world of their day the
[1:12:33] world had started to rub off and the
[1:12:35] thinking of the world has started to rub
[1:12:37] off and and things that were once black
[1:12:39] is as as black and white is white pretty
[1:12:42] soon they got you know where it wasn't
[1:12:44] so bad and and it's not such a big deal
[1:12:46] and you know it really doesn't matter
[1:12:48] and and and it's and I guess it's okay
[1:12:50] and who who what's going on
[1:12:54] yeah what's going on subtly they're
[1:12:56] beginning to lose their
[1:12:59] identity the very the very reality that
[1:13:03] God had called them to be sons of God
[1:13:06] that God had called them to be the
[1:13:07] daughters of God and in their mixing and
[1:13:10] the rubbing of the world somehow they
[1:13:12] got into a position where they had lost
[1:13:14] their real
[1:13:17] identity and so God would send a prophet
[1:13:20] back into their midst Hallelujah
[1:13:23] listen send a prophet back into their
[1:13:26] midst and he'd call them to a
[1:13:29] showdown he'd call them to a showdown
[1:13:32] you know people don't like this kind of
[1:13:33] preaching anymore they they they they
[1:13:35] want a god they want a God that that
[1:13:37] that will be whatever they'll leted him
[1:13:38] to be sure I worship God sure we bow our
[1:13:42] heads and pray sure we we know there's a
[1:13:44] Jehovah up there somewhere I know he
[1:13:46] cares but he but he doesn't really care
[1:13:48] about us no he cares about you he cares
[1:13:51] about what you thought this morning he
[1:13:52] cares about how how you felt this
[1:13:54] morning he cared about what went on last
[1:13:56] last week he cares about the struggle in
[1:13:58] your homes he cares about the job he
[1:14:00] cares about every part of your life amen
[1:14:03] he cares do you he
[1:14:07] cares Hallelujah listen Church we're not

[1:14:19] day is a showdown and here God sends a
[1:14:21] you know God sends his prophet Elijah up
[1:14:24] I I want us to recognize something God
[1:14:25] sent a man up who knew his position
[1:14:28] that's right God sent a man into their
[1:14:30] midst who knew his position he knew that
[1:14:33] he was sent there Lord I do all these
[1:14:36] things cuz you told me to amen standing
[1:14:39] there in the presence of what was it 400
[1:14:42] 800 850 so-called prophets preachers of
[1:14:46] the day great men men men with great
[1:14:49] organizations men with great Revelations
[1:14:51] here comes a mighty prophet of of God
[1:14:54] and how did how did God's children get
[1:14:56] in this condition how did God's children
[1:14:59] get in this condition that's
[1:15:04] right God's Prophet comes right into
[1:15:06] their midst and he says choose
[1:15:09] you choose you this day who you're going
[1:15:12] to serve make up your mind who you going
[1:15:15] to serve are you going to serve Jehovah
[1:15:17] are you going to serve baale just make
[1:15:19] up your
[1:15:20] mind look at the picture

[1:15:26] people didn't even know how to
[1:15:28] answer
[1:15:30] my children of
[1:15:32] God you know a prophet of God would call
[1:15:34] it
[1:15:35] Amnesia
[1:15:37] right he'd call it
[1:15:40] Amnesia they got caught between the
[1:15:43] opinion right not the opinion the
[1:15:46] unadulterated word of God right the
[1:15:49] unadulterated word of God they got
[1:15:50] caught between the unadulterated word of
[1:15:52] God the word's opinion and the world's
[1:15:56] opinion you know there's only one letter
[1:15:58] difference between those two
[1:16:00] words strange isn't it just one letter
[1:16:03] difference wasn't it just one word
[1:16:05] difference that caused Eve to get in her
[1:16:10] condition brother Brown would say this
[1:16:12] another thing that caused that it caused
[1:16:14] among the people is getting between two
[1:16:17] opinions that'll cause Amnesia yes it
[1:16:21] gets you to a place where you actually

[1:56:58] name's got he's he's ready to uh uh you
[1:57:00] know exterminate all these people and
[1:57:03] and Esther's found out about it and
[1:57:04] she's asked the Church of God she said
[1:57:06] listen I know but I haven't been called
[1:57:08] I haven't been called to come before the
[1:57:10] king and it's a death sentence to walk
[1:57:12] into his presence or though being called
[1:57:14] yeah right
[1:57:15] unless unless he should take the scepter
[1:57:18] the golden scepter and hand it
[1:57:21] out right watch her only
[1:57:24] request you
[1:57:26] pray come on Church come on Church you
[1:57:31] pray may I say this this morning I don't
[1:57:33] know why this struck me there's a reason
[1:57:35] your pastor was laying down and out
[1:57:38] there's a reason he came home so sick
[1:57:40] God didn't just listen he's a lion's
[1:57:42] heart he's been there many times there's
[1:57:44] a reason that he got put in that
[1:57:46] position and it wasn't just about him
[1:57:48] come on maybe God needed to get your
[1:57:50] attention take something you love and
[1:57:53] call you to a place where you would
[1:57:55] intercede where you would get down on
[1:57:57] your knees where you would go to the
[1:57:58] throne of God where you would be the
[1:58:01] Esther
[1:58:03] hallelujah praise God God allows those
[1:58:06] things to happen in our lives God allows
[1:58:09] those things to happen to grab your
[1:58:11] attention somebody that listen he might
[1:58:14] be one here that you all love on the
[1:58:15] other side of the world maybe his name's
[1:58:17] not mentioned but God wanted mentioned
[1:58:21] here so we would start to pray and pray
[1:58:25] and that's all es Esther said listen
[1:58:27] just pray for three days and then I'll
[1:58:30] go into the presence of the king in

[2:09:43] power just just randomly just to prove
[2:09:45] to you know prove something to somebody
[2:09:48] she gets the unction of the spirit or
[2:09:50] she just shuts up listen there's times I

[2:12:49] Hallelujah they're becoming one for the
[2:12:51] wedding supper pardon me there's nothing
[2:12:53] left for us to do but believe it and
[2:12:55] believe it is the substance and that
[2:12:58] creates a perfect Faith what's a perfect
[2:13:02] Faith a perfect Faith calls those things
[2:13:05] that are not as though they are that's
[2:13:08] right so when you look in the mirror and
[2:13:10] see what you're not call it as though it
[2:13:13] is amen when you look at the word of God
[2:13:15] and you see I don't measure up call
[2:13:17] yourself according to the word walk in
[2:13:19] the vision of the word let the word
[2:13:21] become let become the word amen don't
[2:13:25] look at it and see all the times we

[2:13:31] blood be the blood don't make it of none
[2:13:33] effect in your life let the blood be the
[2:13:35] blood and then take the Living Word of

[2:13:40] hallelujah yes brother R was saying the
[2:13:43] pergan church age he said he is the word
[2:13:47] so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man
[2:13:49] in faith takes that word into his heart
[2:13:52] and places it upon his lips right
[2:13:56] brother Ron's
[2:13:58] lips brother zig's
[2:14:01] lips on brother James's
[2:14:05] lips
[2:14:07] no Your
[2:14:09] Lips Your Lips My Lips amen when a
[2:14:13] spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith
[2:14:15] takes the word into his heart and places
[2:14:17] it upon his lips why that is the same
[2:14:21] as who is deity what is deity it's God
[2:14:26] that is the same as God speaking Every
[2:14:29] Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand
[2:14:32] before that man remember the quote and I
[2:14:35] don't think I sent it to to to the
[2:14:37] brothers in the back but remember the
[2:14:38] quote of the church age book brother
[2:14:40] Brown would say this he cannot he's you
[2:14:42] know how Satan will fight a True
[2:14:43] Believer every every step of the way
[2:14:45] you're going to battle every step of the
[2:14:47] way you're going to battle brother BR
[2:14:48] say this he that the the reason you're
[2:14:51] battling is for Revelation Church amen
[2:14:53] don't forget this the battle is for
[2:14:56] Revelation because Revelation is
[2:14:59] unshakable as long as you've only got
[2:15:01] the word in your mind you can be
[2:15:03] shaken but once it drops down and
[2:15:06] becomes anchored you can't be shaken no
[2:15:08] more amen amen speaking of Satan he says
[2:15:12] he cannot stand it he knows that if the
[2:15:14] people get the true revelation of the
[2:15:16] true church and what she is what she
[2:15:19] stands for she can do the Greater Works
[2:15:23] for she will be an
[2:15:26] invincible Army amen if they get a true
[2:15:30] revelation of the two spirits in the
[2:15:31] framework of the Christian Church By
[2:15:33] God's spirit discern and withstand the
[2:15:36] Antichrist Spirit that's the one that
[2:15:38] tells you that you're not that you're
[2:15:40] not good enough that you don't
[2:15:42] understand enough that you don't got
[2:15:43] enough you just you're not going to make
[2:15:44] it you just you've got too much that's
[2:15:46] the Antichrist spirit anything that
[2:15:48] takes you off of the word of God the
[2:15:50] promise he has for your life that's
[2:15:52] Antichrist the word Christ means
[2:15:54] anointed by the way all right he will be
[2:15:58] as definitely thwarted as when Christ
[2:16:00] with stod his every effort to gain power
[2:16:01] over him in the desert yes Satan hates
[2:16:07] Revelation but we love it we love it
[2:16:11] praise the Lord with true Revelation in
[2:16:13] our lives the Gates of Hell cannot
[2:16:14] Prevail against us but we will prevail
[2:16:17] over them yes well brother Dwayne it's
[2:16:20] different today is
[2:16:24] it why is it
[2:16:26] different well brother Dwayne and Israel
[2:16:29] had the pillar of fire they followed it
[2:16:31] and we know back when the prophet was
[2:16:33] here you know the pillar of fire all we
[2:16:34] got is a picture
[2:16:36] today
[2:16:38] really is that all the revelation we
[2:16:41] got a picture I know your pastor teaches
[2:16:44] different than this so I'm okay is that
[2:16:46] all we got a picture on our wall that we
[2:16:49] can point to somebody and say well back
[2:16:51] 70 years ago let me tell you the story
[2:16:54] it's good I'm not I'm not belittling it
[2:16:57] I'm thankful for the picture but if all
[2:17:00] we've got is yesterday's news where's
[2:17:02] the god of
[2:17:04] today listen we're thankful for the
[2:17:06] messenger we're thankful for the message
[2:17:08] but it didn't come just to give us head
[2:17:09] knowledge and and and a and a history
[2:17:11] lesson it was proving that God was God
[2:17:14] then and the same word is here today to
[2:17:16] prove that God is God today Hallelujah
[2:17:20] you want to know where the pillar of
[2:17:21] fire is today well brother Dwayne we

[2:17:28] eyes god listen if brother Dwayne could
[2:17:31] tell you where it is but you might not
[2:17:32] believe him but if I give you thus say
[2:17:34] the Lord then you had better believe
[2:17:37] what he
[2:17:41] says Paradox
[2:17:44] 1964 says the pillar of fire is
[2:17:46] identified scientific
[2:17:48] scientifically and by the reaction by
[2:17:50] its character and everything else just
[2:17:53] the same as it was when it was dwelling
[2:17:55] in the body of God's only begotten son
[2:17:59] so does it dwell in the body of his
[2:18:03] adopted Sons for this last day
[2:18:07] Hallelujah listen I don't know how much

[2:18:12] somewhere that the spirit of God begins

[2:27:52] a Sunday morning service or a Sunday
[2:27:54] evening service or a Wednesday night
[2:27:56] service I'm not talking about a church
[2:27:58] who can say I know God sent a prophet I
[2:28:01] am talking about a body that literally
[2:28:03] breathes the Breath of Life someone who

[2:29:30] just becomes this nervous little
[2:29:32] something a shame on those kind of men
