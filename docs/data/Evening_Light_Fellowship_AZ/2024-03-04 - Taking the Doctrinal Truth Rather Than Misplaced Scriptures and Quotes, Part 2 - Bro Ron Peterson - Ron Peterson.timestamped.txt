[56:57] let's just bow our heads a moment
[56:59] heavenly father as I lay my hands upon
[57:02] this sacred
[57:05] book A book
[57:07] that for hundreds
[57:09] and thousands of years now father you
[57:13] have watched over this
[57:16] book you have inspired men of
[57:20] old they spoke in
[57:23] Prophecy under inspir ation of the Holy
[57:26] Spirit and they did not understand many
[57:29] of the things that what they
[57:31] spoke knowing it might be for another
[57:34] time or another season but here we are
[57:36] at the end of this loudan age at the
[57:41] very end of time
[57:43] itself and father I thank you for your
[57:47] word your word is a guide it is a
[57:51] compass it is your thoughts in written
[57:56] form therefore father I pray as you
[58:00] inspired those men of old to write it
[58:03] down as they spoke by
[58:05] inspiration May the same holy
[58:10] spirit that anointed them anoint us this
[58:14] morning give us the isv of
[58:18] understanding speak to us father draw
[58:22] close and we'll give you praise and
[58:25] honor and glory in Jesus Christ's name
[58:27] we ask it am amen amen God bless you all
[58:32] let's just remain standing please if you
[58:34] would I want to turn to 2 Timothy chap
[58:38] 2:
[58:40] 14-8 2 Timothy Chapter 2 then we're
[58:44] going to turn to Revelations 22 thank
[58:47] you musicians I appreciate all of your
[58:51] servitude to the body of
[58:53] Christ
[58:57] second Timothy Chapter 2 I've got an
[58:59] awful lot this morning I am going to
[59:03] ask the technical Brethren that are
[59:06] doing the quotes stay with me because
[59:09] I'm going to go
[59:11] quickly and I have uh many of the things
[59:15] and sometimes in the quote it may be a
[59:17] large paragraph but there'll just be a
[59:19] highlighted portion I'm going to read
[59:22] the highlighted portion most of the time
[59:26] just to make reference to show you where
[59:28] it's at and uh uh everything so uh if I
[59:34] go a little too
[59:36] fast uh I will try not to do that I am
[59:39] by Nature a speed
[59:41] reader and if you're ever a speed reader
[59:44] you read your few
[59:46] sentences um or a few words at least
[59:50] ahead of your mind uh and uh definitely
[59:54] ahead of your
[59:56] tongue and so I'm going to try to slow
[59:59] down and get them both in Focus so that
[1:00:02] I don't slur or to uh wrongly pronounce
[1:00:06] or anything uh and leave any words out
[1:00:10] second Timothy Chapter 2 are you there
[1:00:14] amen somebody say let's go let's go all
[1:00:17] right second Timothy chapter 2 verse
[1:00:22] 14 and of these things put in
[1:00:24] remembrance charging them before the
[1:00:27] Lord that they strive not about words to
[1:00:31] no
[1:00:32] profit but to the subverting of the
[1:00:36] hearers study to show your thyself
[1:00:40] approved unto God a Workman that needeth
[1:00:43] not to be ashamed rightly dividing the
[1:00:47] word of
[1:00:48] truth but shun profane and vain
[1:00:51] babblings for they will increase unto
[1:00:54] more or
[1:00:57] ungodliness and their word will eat as
[1:01:00] doth a
[1:01:01] canker of whom is hus and
[1:01:05] philetus who concerning the truth have
[1:01:09] aired saying that the resurrection is
[1:01:12] passed already and overthrow the faith
[1:01:16] of
[1:01:18] some how
[1:01:20] sad that when the word is misplaced
[1:01:23] misinterpreted
[1:01:26] dislocated it can overthrow the faith of
[1:01:31] some turn with me to the Book of
[1:01:33] Revelation chapter
[1:01:39] 22 verses 18-
[1:01:51] 21 revelation
[1:01:53] 22:18 for I testify unto every man that
[1:01:56] heareth the words of the prophecy of
[1:01:59] this
[1:02:00] book If any man shall add unto these
[1:02:04] things God shall add unto him the
[1:02:06] plagues that are written in the
[1:02:09] book If any man shall take away from the
[1:02:11] words of the book of this
[1:02:14] prophecy God shall take away his part
[1:02:17] out of the book of life and out of the
[1:02:20] holy city and from the things which are
[1:02:22] written in this book
[1:02:26] he which testifieth these saying saith
[1:02:29] surely I come quickly amen even so come
[1:02:32] Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus
[1:02:35] Christ be with you all and we all said
[1:02:38] amen amen God bless you you can be
[1:02:40] seated this morning in the presence of
[1:02:42] the Lord amen good to see so many out to
[1:02:45] the house of the Lord and all our
[1:02:46] visitors and each and every one but to
[1:02:48] you the local faithful I say God richly
[1:02:51] bless you also amen I'm continuing on
[1:02:55] with this thought I'm hoping to try to
[1:02:58] finish uh and yet it's going to now
[1:03:02] Branch off into another direction as
[1:03:04] soon as we get done with this now
[1:03:07] understand when I take something and I
[1:03:08] try to teach from it I do a study series
[1:03:11] it's not just taking a quote or a
[1:03:14] certain subject but when I research
[1:03:16] something just so that you know how I
[1:03:19] operate I do a an exhaustive research
[1:03:24] church amen I try to read as many of the
[1:03:28] quotes as much as I can and uh sometimes
[1:03:32] my wife uh she asks me how are you doing
[1:03:35] she comes in brings me a little snack
[1:03:38] during the day or whatever and she says
[1:03:40] how are you and I said sometimes I have
[1:03:43] too much
[1:03:45] information and uh you've done so much
[1:03:49] reading so I'm asking the Lord Jesus
[1:03:52] this morning to take and try to condense
[1:03:56] everything down to bullet points or to
[1:04:00] high points uh that you can understand
[1:04:03] some things now I'm continuing on with
[1:04:06] the thought this is my title this
[1:04:08] morning taking the doctrinal
[1:04:12] truth rather than a misplaced scripture
[1:04:15] and
[1:04:18] quote I want you to
[1:04:21] understand that they took the words of
[1:04:23] Jesus
[1:04:24] and made certain doctrines and failed to
[1:04:26] take his teaching
[1:04:28] right they did the same thing with the
[1:04:32] Apostle Paul took some of his words made
[1:04:35] a Doctrine failed to take his teaching
[1:04:37] right they're doing the same thing with
[1:04:39] the message they take certain words of
[1:04:42] the prophet of God make a Doctrine fail
[1:04:45] to take his teaching what we want is the
[1:04:47] whole counsel of God now we're doing the
[1:04:50] subject of the book of life and the
[1:04:52] Lamb's Book of Life now let me just take
[1:04:56] a moment to caution
[1:04:59] you that sometimes you can get a
[1:05:03] misconstrued or a skewed
[1:05:06] picture of a Doctrine within the
[1:05:10] scripture or within the message because
[1:05:13] of isolated
[1:05:15] quotes nothing wrong with quotes right
[1:05:18] but sometimes it's the way in which
[1:05:20] they're put together or in the way in
[1:05:23] which they're over
[1:05:25] emphasized and so we know that the Bible
[1:05:28] is full of all kinds of
[1:05:32] doctrines we know that but if you preach
[1:05:34] only healing why there's more than
[1:05:37] healing right if you preach salvation
[1:05:40] there's more than just
[1:05:42] salvation and so we don't want to get
[1:05:46] high
[1:05:46] centered uh stuck on in a rut or
[1:05:50] something in doctrinal teachings otherwi
[1:05:54] wise hey hey are you ever going to get
[1:05:56] uh job off of the
[1:05:59] Ashy and so uh but uh just I've often
[1:06:05] said be
[1:06:06] careful of quotes that tend to be
[1:06:10] isolated and
[1:06:15] overemphasized now in Acts chapter 20
[1:06:19] going to read another portion of
[1:06:22] scripture acts chap 20 verse
[1:06:29] 27-31 for I have not shown to declare
[1:06:31] unto you
[1:06:33] the all the counsel of God I like that
[1:06:38] he didn't just take one part but he said
[1:06:40] I'm not shun to
[1:06:42] declare all of the counsel of God take
[1:06:46] heed therefore unto
[1:06:48] yourselves and O and to all the flock
[1:06:51] over the which the Holy Ghost has made
[1:06:54] made you
[1:06:55] overseers to feed the Church of God
[1:06:58] which he hath purchased with his own
[1:07:01] blood for I know this that after my
[1:07:05] departing shall grievously shall
[1:07:08] Grievous wolves enter in among you not
[1:07:12] sparing the
[1:07:13] flock also of your own selves now he
[1:07:17] puts it back on them not only somebody
[1:07:19] from without but how about somebody
[1:07:21] raising up how many knows brother Ram
[1:07:24] said watch the devil will not let you
[1:07:27] stay as one happy
[1:07:29] family he said he will ra he will send
[1:07:32] somebody in from outside or raise
[1:07:35] somebody up within you shoot them full
[1:07:37] of poison next thing you know it starts
[1:07:39] going through the
[1:07:40] church he says that in a word to the
[1:07:43] church
[1:07:45] yes so also of your own selves verse 30
[1:07:49] shall men
[1:07:50] arise speaking perverse things
[1:07:54] to draw away disciples after them do you
[1:07:58] see that that's what they're doing well
[1:08:01] I got a little Doctrine I got a little
[1:08:02] bit too and next thing you know brother
[1:08:04] Brenham calls them
[1:08:06] pull-offs they take a little group of
[1:08:08] people overemphasize a certain thing got
[1:08:10] a special Revelation next thing you know
[1:08:13] you ain't making it in the Rapture
[1:08:14] unless you come under this Revelation
[1:08:17] and they pull away disciples after
[1:08:20] themselves therefore Watch Remember by
[1:08:22] the space of 3 years
[1:08:24] I cease not to warn everyone night and
[1:08:27] day with tears so we are in the time
[1:08:30] right now of false prophets and false
[1:08:35] teachers and seducing clergy Spirits
[1:08:39] we're right in the midst of it amen
[1:08:41] excuse
[1:08:42] me now in the spoken word is the
[1:08:45] original seed for my first quote
[1:08:47] here watch what brother Ram said he says
[1:08:51] talking about the devil he didn't come
[1:08:53] through through Adam shame on you who
[1:08:56] don't see that it's not Adam's fault he
[1:08:58] had nothing to do with it if death came
[1:09:00] by Adam then it come by
[1:09:02] God death come by cross
[1:09:06] breeding death can't come by God's
[1:09:09] word death comes by cross breeding it to
[1:09:12] Don to
[1:09:14] denomination and Creed instead of
[1:09:17] Christ Dogma instead of the word it
[1:09:20] doesn't come by the word the word of the
[1:09:23] word is life amen Jesus said my words
[1:09:26] are life and the spirit quickens that
[1:09:28] word and makes it life amen to cross
[1:09:32] breed it there's where the death comes
[1:09:35] from
[1:09:36] amen paragraph 50 now Adam did not was
[1:09:41] not deceived but his bride was
[1:09:45] deceived Christ today is not
[1:09:48] deceived the word is not deceiving it's
[1:09:52] the bride that's doing the deceiving by
[1:09:56] the
[1:09:57] word what are they doing with the word
[1:10:00] now this is SoCal bride because we know
[1:10:02] the bride's not going to be deceived but
[1:10:05] he's
[1:10:07] in uh pleasing this that bride here is
[1:10:11] female if you're not careful the female
[1:10:14] gets out of her place she adds to takes
[1:10:16] away from the word of God next thing you
[1:10:17] know it's
[1:10:18] hybrid no longer
[1:10:21] has the life of the Original Seed
[1:10:26] um personally I know by
[1:10:29] experience since I came into this
[1:10:31] message that every
[1:10:33] ISM every offshoot within this message
[1:10:37] have their quotes and their
[1:10:40] scriptures every one of
[1:10:42] them and but each one of them will
[1:10:46] overemphasize a certain portion of what
[1:10:49] they believe and therefore they become
[1:10:52] exclusive we got it it's us you're not
[1:10:56] in it you're not a part of the Bride if
[1:10:58] you don't believe what we believe that
[1:11:00] sort of thing next thing you know uh the
[1:11:03] body of Christ is all divided because
[1:11:05] One Believes this one believes that I'm
[1:11:08] of sephus I'm of Paul and Paul got so
[1:11:11] upset he said I'm glad I never even
[1:11:13] baptized any of you except for gaes and
[1:11:16] a few others and he said uh unless you
[1:11:19] say I baptize you in my
[1:11:21] name now
[1:11:24] uh there are some quotes that look
[1:11:27] contradictory and there are certain
[1:11:30] things within the Bible that may appear
[1:11:33] to be of conflict or contrary one to
[1:11:36] another let me give you an example
[1:11:39] Matthew 28:19 go into all the world
[1:11:41] preach the gospel them that believe let
[1:11:43] them be baptized in the name of the
[1:11:45] father Son and Holy Ghost but on Acts
[1:11:49] chapter 2 when the Holy Spirit came down
[1:11:52] men and Brethren what do we do to be
[1:11:54] saved repent be baptized in the name of
[1:11:57] the father Son and Holy
[1:12:02] Ghost did is only a few of you know your
[1:12:06] scripture there's only two or three you
[1:12:08] said
[1:12:10] no see do you see how easily that could
[1:12:14] be so
[1:12:15] confused no one was ever baptized the
[1:12:19] name of the father Son and Holy Ghost so
[1:12:22] either they had a revelation
[1:12:24] what is the name of the father and of
[1:12:26] the son and of the Holy Ghost CU those
[1:12:28] are not names or titles we don't need to
[1:12:31] go into that so that would appear to be
[1:12:33] a contradiction well it's not a
[1:12:36] contradiction when you have
[1:12:39] Revelation and 90% of the time or
[1:12:42] greater within the message when you see
[1:12:45] something and you don't understand it is
[1:12:47] cuz you lack
[1:12:50] Revelation some where in your mind you
[1:12:54] either taught a certain uh Viewpoint of
[1:12:57] that well that's what my pastor taught
[1:12:59] me or uh that's the way I've always
[1:13:02] believed that's what I got back in
[1:13:04] pentec that's what I got over here at
[1:13:06] the Baptist Church well if you're not
[1:13:09] careful you bring all that baggage with
[1:13:11] you into the message next thing you know
[1:13:15] you've you've hybrid this message with
[1:13:19] all of your former teaching I love where
[1:13:22] the Apostle Paul said that all of my
[1:13:24] former teaching I consider as
[1:13:29] Dum that I might know
[1:13:32] Christ yes so three things we must not
[1:13:36] do to the
[1:13:37] scriptures misinterpret it misplace it
[1:13:42] or dislocate it so you cannot do that
[1:13:47] now understand when we're talking about
[1:13:49] the book of life and the Lamb's Book of
[1:13:52] Life when you do your exhaustive
[1:13:55] study on both of these
[1:13:58] subjects you will find out that the vast
[1:14:01] majority of the quotes what brother
[1:14:03] Brenham talks about the book of
[1:14:05] life he will always quote most of the
[1:14:09] time the majority of the time he who
[1:14:12] adds to and takes
[1:14:14] away talking about what a curse it is
[1:14:18] for you to misinterpret it dislocate it
[1:14:22] huh to make it say something that and
[1:14:26] what um a warning to all of us take heed
[1:14:31] under yourselves yes you think God will
[1:14:34] Overlook You by putting your own
[1:14:37] interpretation to God's word say what
[1:14:40] the word says amen don't add to it if
[1:14:43] you don't understand it just say well
[1:14:45] that's what the word says
[1:14:47] period okay
[1:14:51] now um
[1:14:54] if you take an isolated
[1:14:57] quote and you look at
[1:15:00] it you may get a little
[1:15:03] confused because you're misplacing it
[1:15:05] taking it out of context I've often said
[1:15:09] when you get a quote or a scripture take
[1:15:12] and read the whole chapter and you get
[1:15:16] you get now within that whole chapter
[1:15:19] the context of what this verse is
[1:15:22] talking about yes same way it is now
[1:15:25] I've often
[1:15:26] said that reading the spoken word books
[1:15:31] are good but it's better to hear the
[1:15:34] tape yeah why the voice has an
[1:15:37] inflection within it that's emphasizing
[1:15:41] certain
[1:15:42] things okay and so uh but if you can't
[1:15:46] listen to a tape read the book of
[1:15:48] course and um so anyway here uh
[1:15:54] in the sermon Christ is the mystery of
[1:15:57] God
[1:15:58] revealed
[1:16:01] 1963 God is not known by education he is
[1:16:05] not he is not known by how to explain it
[1:16:10] now if we're not careful even I try to
[1:16:12] explain to you the third pole or the
[1:16:16] Mysteries being revealed and the prophet
[1:16:19] got himself into trouble the angel said
[1:16:22] sh amen don't try to explain it amen you
[1:16:26] do don't get your line all tangled up in
[1:16:30] times like these right any of you ever
[1:16:32] gone fishing before and got the open
[1:16:34] face reel all of a sudden you got a
[1:16:36] bird's nest everybody else is catching
[1:16:39] fish and for you for the next 20 minutes
[1:16:42] you're
[1:16:43] just you know you want to kind of drop
[1:16:45] it overboard and grab you another rod
[1:16:47] and
[1:16:48] reel but don't get your line all tangled
[1:16:52] up
[1:16:53] in a time like this in fact I caught a
[1:16:55] fish one time when I had a big old
[1:16:56] bird's nest and all of a sudden this
[1:16:58] thing I'm trying to get rid of all this
[1:17:01] line and everything and
[1:17:02] all so I just brought it in by hand
[1:17:08] anyway so watch this God is known by
[1:17:12] Simplicity and the revelation of Jesus
[1:17:15] Christ to the most illiterate
[1:17:18] person see not your theology it's a
[1:17:21] revelation of Jesus Christ CH Upon This
[1:17:23] Rock I'll build my
[1:17:25] church now he goes on now watch this he
[1:17:28] says Watch God's Great Revelation
[1:17:32] unfolding how many of you know that this
[1:17:35] message kept unfolding to the prophet
[1:17:39] amen he didn't understand his
[1:17:42] ministry didn't understand uh this great
[1:17:45] blast the vision am I going to die goes
[1:17:48] up to to Sabino
[1:17:51] Canyon tells Billy Paul I probably am
[1:17:53] not coming home take care of the wife
[1:17:55] and
[1:17:57] kids and then you know when the sword
[1:18:00] appears into his hand and he understands
[1:18:03] and it unfolds to him this is not the
[1:18:06] end of your ministry this is the
[1:18:08] furtherance he comes running down off
[1:18:11] the mountain screaming MAA MAA I'm not
[1:18:13] going to
[1:18:14] die it's a furtherance of my Ministry it
[1:18:17] kept unfolding to him he thought it was
[1:18:21] over now now so now watch this paragraph
[1:18:27] 304 by the lack of this
[1:18:30] Revelation is why we have so many
[1:18:32] different divisions among us so much
[1:18:36] mockery so much division Among Us is
[1:18:38] because the people lack that Revelation
[1:18:39] see the lack of that Revelation the
[1:18:43] teachers what are they lacking the
[1:18:46] unfolding God in his season unfolds his
[1:18:50] word how many of you can say Amen to to
[1:18:53] that because when you were a child you
[1:18:55] thought as a child but when you became a
[1:18:57] man God unfolded greater things to you
[1:19:01] why because you were mature and could
[1:19:03] handle
[1:19:04] it plain and simple now excuse
[1:19:09] me now for this morning I want to take a
[1:19:12] detailed look at the prophet's doctrinal
[1:19:16] teaching on the book of life and the
[1:19:19] Lamb's Book of Life Is there a
[1:19:21] difference what is the correct doctrinal
[1:19:24] teaching again I told you the Book of
[1:19:27] Life in parentheses in the message is
[1:19:31] 518
[1:19:34] times the Lamb's Book of Life in
[1:19:37] parentheses is
[1:19:39] 261
[1:19:40] times in the book of the living He
[1:19:44] quotes it one time ancestry now watch
[1:19:47] this ancestry
[1:19:51] genealogy
[1:19:54] is God's record of a lineage and he does
[1:19:59] this and our bibles are filled with
[1:20:03] genealogies right and I don't know about
[1:20:06] you but have you ever come up and Adam
[1:20:09] beg got and he begat and this and the
[1:20:11] and the names M huh you try to enunciate
[1:20:15] the
[1:20:16] names um you'll have a hard
[1:20:20] time so anyway
[1:20:24] I want to look for a
[1:20:26] moment at some things here in the
[1:20:29] studying of the book of life within the
[1:20:31] confines of the
[1:20:33] message now remember that the vast
[1:20:36] majority of those quotes on The Book of
[1:20:39] Life all have to do and he quotes the
[1:20:42] scripture adding to and taking away from
[1:20:45] right now in The Invisible Union of the
[1:20:48] bride of Christ
[1:20:50] 1965 God had to open up the Seven Seals
[1:20:54] not in a
[1:20:56] denomination I've always been against it
[1:20:59] but out of denomination he might take a
[1:21:01] bride not a denominational bride he
[1:21:03] couldn't do it it's against his own word
[1:21:06] he opened these seven mysteries in there
[1:21:08] that shows forth brings forth those
[1:21:11] things that's been hid since the
[1:21:12] foundation of the world might be
[1:21:15] revealed in the last days two sons of
[1:21:19] God they brought that forth now before
[1:21:22] the people people that they see it there
[1:21:25] now you now to this
[1:21:28] undenominational
[1:21:29] bride raise your hand if you're one of
[1:21:32] them I'm an
[1:21:34] undenominational
[1:21:37] bride there is your two
[1:21:39] books one of them is the Lamb's Book of
[1:21:42] Life your name on there is predestinated
[1:21:46] on there yes amen it can't go because
[1:21:50] you can no more take that away than
[1:21:52] nothing else see because it was for
[1:21:54] ordained to be there amen but the
[1:21:58] regular Book of Life can take that off
[1:22:01] at any time this is doctrinal teaching
[1:22:04] now yes amen
[1:22:09] right so sardian Church
[1:22:13] age brother brandham
[1:22:16] continues all the all Escape Through
[1:22:20] Blood talking about Israel leaving
[1:22:23] Egypt
[1:22:26] all came water enjoying the Holy Spirit
[1:22:29] manifestation and
[1:22:30] blessings all ate angel food all drank
[1:22:34] of the rock that followed them we know
[1:22:36] the Bible says in that rock was
[1:22:39] Christ yet except for a very few there
[1:22:42] were not but carriers for the children
[1:22:44] who should follow them and go into the
[1:22:46] Canaan land all Israel is not
[1:22:51] Israel and all but a tiny minority had
[1:22:55] their names blotted off of The Book of
[1:22:59] Life
[1:23:06] look again continuing on this is the
[1:23:09] next paragraph
[1:23:10] down we have the same right today in the
[1:23:14] church names are going to be blotted out
[1:23:17] of the book of
[1:23:18] life no names will be blotted out of the
[1:23:21] book of eternal life for that is another
[1:23:27] record and though contained in the Book
[1:23:31] of Life brother Bram says it's contained
[1:23:35] so the Book of Life inside the Book of
[1:23:38] Life contained within it is another book
[1:23:41] come on it's called the
[1:23:44] Lamb's Book of Life on
[1:23:46] Amen
[1:23:48] Now understand that names
[1:23:53] that are on the Book of
[1:23:55] Life you will find out that some of
[1:23:58] those names are going to be blotted
[1:24:00] out now foolish virgin will not have her
[1:24:04] name blotted out because she
[1:24:09] is said she will be there
[1:24:11] absolutely so when you look at within
[1:24:14] the message right now let me bring it
[1:24:16] down make it personal you see some that
[1:24:19] may because of whatever reason whatever
[1:24:23] excuse they leave the
[1:24:26] message they say well I don't really
[1:24:30] understand it they leave the church and
[1:24:32] when they do they start doing their own
[1:24:34] thing and here's how I see it as long as
[1:24:38] they do not reject nor to make fun of or
[1:24:44] to discredit the message of the hour
[1:24:48] it's a very good chance they will remain
[1:24:50] as foolish virgin right and be saved in
[1:24:53] the end but if they
[1:24:56] [Music]
[1:24:59] reject now that's going to be between
[1:25:01] them and God because when they come up
[1:25:03] to the that one lady even looked at the
[1:25:05] picture of the pillar of fire and
[1:25:07] smirked and he said she blasphemed
[1:25:11] God so understand this is a very very
[1:25:16] serious
[1:25:18] situation there will be names blotted
[1:25:21] out that were on there Book of Life I'm
[1:25:24] going to go into a greater detail
[1:25:26] because I want you to fully understand
[1:25:28] what brother Rim taught so there is
[1:25:31] another book that's contained in the
[1:25:34] Book of Life brother Brenham calls it an
[1:25:36] addendum to the book of light he said
[1:25:39] that's the Lamb's Book of light now the
[1:25:43] Bible says that the books were
[1:25:46] opened and these are records of
[1:25:51] genealogies of all Life Born since the
[1:25:55] foundation of the world now listen to
[1:25:57] this both seed and
[1:26:00] nonseed that's
[1:26:04] right our Bible is filled with
[1:26:07] genealogies and ancestries according to
[1:26:10] birth
[1:26:11] order and being a seed Gene of God you
[1:26:14] will find out in the SE Gene of God
[1:26:18] lineage
[1:26:20] ancestry genealogy
[1:26:23] you will never
[1:26:24] see the lineage of the serpent in
[1:26:31] there because he's not part of the amen
[1:26:35] Book of Life I'm going to get into this
[1:26:38] now I'm going to share some stuff with
[1:26:42] you so we got to look at some of the
[1:26:45] hints in the Old Testament of prophets
[1:26:49] and of men of God looking into
[1:26:51] ancestries and genealogies
[1:26:54] Nehemiah 7:
[1:26:57] 5-8 and my God put into my heart to
[1:27:00] gather together the Nobles the rulers
[1:27:03] the people that they might be reckoned
[1:27:05] by
[1:27:06] genealogy and I found a register of the
[1:27:09] genealogy of them which came up at the
[1:27:12] first and found written
[1:27:15] therein and then he begins to say these
[1:27:17] are the children of the province that
[1:27:19] went up into
[1:27:21] captivity carried away whom
[1:27:23] Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon and
[1:27:25] carried him away now watch this verse 7
[1:27:29] who came with zerubabel jeshua Nehemiah
[1:27:32] Azariah ramiah
[1:27:35] nahani Mori ban Miss for Earth and he
[1:27:39] goes on and
[1:27:40] on that's a genealogy is it
[1:27:44] not Ezekiel picks it up in chap 13:
[1:27:49] 7-9 have you not seen a v Vision have
[1:27:52] you not spoken a lying
[1:27:55] divination whereas say the Lord saith
[1:27:58] albe it I have not
[1:28:00] spoken therefore thus sayith the Lord
[1:28:03] God because you have spoken vanity and
[1:28:07] seen lies and before behold I'm against
[1:28:09] you saith the Lord
[1:28:11] God and my hand shall be upon the
[1:28:14] prophets that see vanity and the Divine
[1:28:17] lies they shall not be in the Assembly
[1:28:20] of my people neither shall they be
[1:28:22] written in the writing of the House of
[1:28:24] Israel referring to books written of
[1:28:29] genealogy neither shall they enter into
[1:28:31] the land of
[1:28:32] Israel and ye shall know that I am the
[1:28:36] Lord God so I want to show you a lineage
[1:28:39] of Cain because brother Brenham says I
[1:28:42] want to show you the two
[1:28:45] Vines start in Genesis follow the
[1:28:49] lineage now I'm going to show you the
[1:28:51] lineage of Cain and you will find out in
[1:28:54] the lineage of Cain there is no seed
[1:28:57] Gene of god mentioned right
[1:29:06] amen Genesis 4 verses 16- 24 it's good
[1:29:12] for you to see this and Cain went out
[1:29:14] from the presence of the Lord and dwelt
[1:29:17] in the Land of
[1:29:19] Nod on the East of Eden
[1:29:22] and Cain knew his wife and she conceived
[1:29:25] and bear Enoch now this is not Enoch
[1:29:28] that we know
[1:29:29] of who is the seventh from Adam that's
[1:29:32] right two different
[1:29:35] Enochs and he build it a city this is
[1:29:37] the first one in the scripture he built
[1:29:39] a city amazing now watch brother R said
[1:29:42] watch this lineage of Cain scientific
[1:29:46] Builders yes
[1:29:49] musicians watch this and he build a the
[1:29:52] city and name of the city and after the
[1:29:54] name of his son Enoch and Enoch was born
[1:29:57] uh irad and irad begat mahul and mulio
[1:30:01] begat
[1:30:02] Mel Mel beat lamech and lamech took him
[1:30:05] two wives first time you see uh
[1:30:11] polygamy the name of one was Adam and
[1:30:13] the other name was Zilla and adab bear
[1:30:16] jabel and he was the father of such that
[1:30:18] dwell in Twins and such as have cattle
[1:30:22] now notice You'll Always Find that when
[1:30:25] there is a fight it usually was it was
[1:30:27] between the cattle herds of one and the
[1:30:30] sheep of the
[1:30:32] other yeah and did you know that really
[1:30:36] they the Egyptians thought that it was
[1:30:40] it was horrible to be a shepherd of
[1:30:43] sheep they only looked and gave
[1:30:45] preeminence to cattle in fact in
[1:30:49] our Western Civilization as it went West
[1:30:53] sheep herders were very frowned upon
[1:30:55] looked upon persecuted by the
[1:30:59] Cowboys and the land Barons and that and
[1:31:03] they ran away the Sheep killed them and
[1:31:05] all that okay so
[1:31:08] now verse 21 and his brother's name was
[1:31:11] jubel he was a father of all that's uh
[1:31:15] as all such as handled the harp and
[1:31:19] organ musical instruments
[1:31:22] and Zilla also Beed tubil can instructor
[1:31:25] of every
[1:31:26] artificer in brass and iron do you see
[1:31:30] the two two lineages brother random says
[1:31:33] now watch the lineage of God the seed
[1:31:36] Gene they're simple they're
[1:31:38] humble they're you know they till the
[1:31:42] soil they do things but he says watch
[1:31:44] King they build cities they're
[1:31:47] scientists they're smart how many of you
[1:31:49] know that the Bible says that the
[1:31:50] children of the wicked one the children
[1:31:53] of Cain are smarter than the children of
[1:31:57] God yes sir don't even try to keep up
[1:32:00] with
[1:32:00] them hey thank you now I'm not giving
[1:32:04] you all the right to quit
[1:32:07] college and to say well that's the
[1:32:09] reason I get a d instead of an
[1:32:12] a no God I want you
[1:32:16] to I know some of you is reading that in
[1:32:19] there and
[1:32:20] it
[1:32:23] Ezekiel 13 I want to show you something
[1:32:26] Ezekiel
[1:32:29] 13 oh wait a second no no no no no no
[1:32:31] I'm sorry go on now let me just go
[1:32:36] on let me
[1:32:39] appeal to this because I'm going to say
[1:32:50] something
[1:32:52] came up with this if there is a tree of
[1:32:56] life there's also a tree
[1:32:59] of De is that
[1:33:04] right which is an opposite what God
[1:33:08] had if there is a book of
[1:33:12] life there must also be another
[1:33:16] book which is a book of
[1:33:19] death or let's call it the book Book of
[1:33:21] the
[1:33:22] Dead Brother Brenham calls it the book
[1:33:25] of Sinners
[1:33:29] yes
[1:33:30] now understand that the Book of the Dead
[1:33:33] I'm just going to throw this out there
[1:33:35] and appeal to your understanding The
[1:33:38] Book of the Dead are nonseed right
[1:33:42] that's
[1:33:43] it they will never be
[1:33:45] quickened they can't
[1:33:47] believe there's nothing in them to
[1:33:53] believe they hate God and the revelation
[1:33:57] of
[1:33:58] God non
[1:34:00] seed they come from another
[1:34:04] book brother Brenham does call it the
[1:34:06] book of
[1:34:07] Sinners these are born sons of
[1:34:12] predition God hates
[1:34:16] them and they were never in the mind of
[1:34:20] God
[1:34:22] they are predestinated to
[1:34:25] Hell and Hell is reserved for the devil
[1:34:28] and his
[1:34:30] angels is that right that's what your
[1:34:33] Bible
[1:34:35] says now again we're talking about these
[1:34:39] books and I talk to you about the Book
[1:34:42] of the
[1:34:43] Dead questions and answers 63 on
[1:34:48] Genesis 53 well now brother renom do you
[1:34:52] mean to tell me there's going to be that
[1:34:53] people's going to be there at the white
[1:34:55] Throne
[1:34:57] judgment the bride will never be
[1:35:01] judged in fact the only judgment the
[1:35:04] bride gets is now and guess what it is
[1:35:06] it's self-judgment because judgment
[1:35:09] begins where House of God that's why we
[1:35:12] come here I don't want to see how good
[1:35:14] I'm doing I want to see how bad I'm
[1:35:15] doing and then I want
[1:35:18] to I want to correct myself amen
[1:35:22] the bride will never be
[1:35:24] judged now look here the Bible said
[1:35:27] judgment was
[1:35:28] set and books were opened
[1:35:32] books were opened is that right books of
[1:35:38] Sinners that's right and another book
[1:35:41] what open which is The Book of
[1:35:43] Life and every man was judged thus is
[1:35:47] that right and who was doing the judging
[1:35:52] Jesus and the
[1:35:53] Saints he came and ministered unto the
[1:35:57] Ancient of Days whose hair is white like
[1:36:00] wool and said 10,000 times 10,000s come
[1:36:05] with him minister to him in the Judgment
[1:36:07] here is King excuse me here Jesus
[1:36:10] returns as king and queen the wedding's
[1:36:13] over he's married here he said stand
[1:36:17] right here uh my right side here that's
[1:36:20] the book was was open was
[1:36:22] Sinners get over on my left and here's
[1:36:26] the ones that their names written in the
[1:36:28] Lamb's Book of Life now he's talking
[1:36:31] about three book books of Sinners Book
[1:36:33] of Life and the Lamb's Book of Life the
[1:36:36] one who is nearest to
[1:36:38] him is only those whose names were in
[1:36:42] the Lamb's Book of
[1:36:46] Life That's doctrinal
[1:36:49] teaching now So This Book of Life let me
[1:36:53] just be all inclusive right
[1:36:56] now it is a record of
[1:36:59] all C
[1:37:02] Gene and I'll explain this in a
[1:37:05] moment but without the Holy
[1:37:08] Spirit they are called foolish
[1:37:12] virgin they were bride material right
[1:37:16] they were considered for bride right
[1:37:20] same
[1:37:21] material but the pattern of the word was
[1:37:24] put on them those who will be saved
[1:37:27] because of their Works according to the
[1:37:29] law because they'll all be judged
[1:37:34] yes some are going to get eternal life
[1:37:38] because they were good to the bride
[1:37:40] somebody say
[1:37:42] bride because they were good to the
[1:37:47] bride
[1:37:48] these will all live out outside the New
[1:37:55] Jerusalem okay are we together
[1:37:58] sir now we take the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:38:03] predestinated elected of God chosen of
[1:38:08] God that's God's
[1:38:10] choosing you didn't choose him he chose
[1:38:15] you you are judged at the house of
[1:38:20] God and you will never stand before him
[1:38:25] in white Throne judgment why you're with
[1:38:29] him is that right we just read
[1:38:32] that but you will stand a
[1:38:36] judgment well brother Ron I thought the
[1:38:39] bride's not judged brother Brenham said
[1:38:40] I want to see him he's just a little bit
[1:38:43] higher right well why can't I see him
[1:38:46] because you got to be
[1:38:48] judged judged
[1:38:51] yeah according to what you did with the
[1:38:54] message that you knew to be
[1:38:57] truth well does Paul got to be
[1:39:00] judged yes sir brother R said
[1:39:04] Hallelujah I said only what Paul said so
[1:39:08] there is a we stand before the Judgment
[1:39:10] seat of God the Bible talks about and
[1:39:12] you'll be given rewards that's what the
[1:39:14] judgment is for yes to some who hid
[1:39:18] their talent they'll take it away from
[1:39:20] him and give it to one who had
[1:39:21] 10 amen imagine that in heaven God be
[1:39:27] unfair well why don't you give it to the
[1:39:29] guy that's only got
[1:39:31] two no God says Hey the guy who was
[1:39:33] faithful and all I'm going to give him
[1:39:35] even more and you that hid your talent
[1:39:38] and did nothing with it you you brought
[1:39:40] no increase to the kingdom of God I'm
[1:39:42] going to take it away from you and yet
[1:39:43] you're going to be
[1:39:50] saved
[1:39:55] so their final
[1:39:58] destination is the New
[1:40:01] Jerusalem that's right the first
[1:40:04] group their final destination is
[1:40:08] Hell thrown into the Lake of
[1:40:11] Fire second group outside the city they
[1:40:15] have
[1:40:16] salvation they have eternal life we'll
[1:40:20] look at this a little bit closer here CU
[1:40:23] I know this is a lot for you to take in
[1:40:25] the last group Lamb's Book of
[1:40:28] Life okay their Eternal
[1:40:32] destination is the city which cometh
[1:40:35] down out of Heaven adorned as a bride
[1:40:39] for her
[1:40:40] bridegroom what is it the New Jerusalem
[1:40:44] amen wow yes sir praise the Lord did you
[1:40:47] know brother Ram said there are levels
[1:40:49] in heaven
[1:40:53] okay I I'll get into that perhaps on
[1:40:55] another sermon now I'm going to give you
[1:40:57] very quickly some um scriptures that
[1:41:01] point to the
[1:41:02] destination of nonseed find it all
[1:41:05] through the scripture Matthew
[1:41:08] 23: 30 and 33 I'm get just going to read
[1:41:11] the highlighted portion wherefore be ye
[1:41:15] Witnesses unto
[1:41:16] yourselves that ye are the children of
[1:41:19] them which killed the prop
[1:41:21] prophets fill ye up the measure of your
[1:41:26] fathers ye
[1:41:28] serpents ye Generation of
[1:41:31] Vipers how can you escape the damnation
[1:41:34] of
[1:41:36] hell they crucified Christ because he
[1:41:39] said you're of your father the devil
[1:41:42] that's right and his works you'll
[1:41:45] do Matthew 25:
[1:41:49] 41-46 depart from me ye cursed into
[1:41:52] Everlasting fire and prepared for the
[1:41:55] devil and his
[1:41:58] angels verse 46 and they shall go away
[1:42:02] into Everlasting
[1:42:04] punishment but the righteous into life
[1:42:07] eternal notice one is Everlasting which
[1:42:10] means Through the Ages thank God that
[1:42:13] hell is not
[1:42:15] Eternal now here is the scripture say
[1:42:18] one is Everlasting the other one is
[1:42:19] eternal life right right amen because if
[1:42:22] you had eternal life in hell and burned
[1:42:26] eternally it's still
[1:42:29] life he said there's only one form of
[1:42:31] eternal life that's comes from
[1:42:36] God 1 Peter 2:
[1:42:40] 7-8 talking about unto him he is
[1:42:43] precious but unto them which be
[1:42:46] disobedient a stone of stumbling a rock
[1:42:49] of offense
[1:42:51] even to them which stumble at the word
[1:42:55] being
[1:42:56] disobedient where unto also they were
[1:43:00] what they're
[1:43:02] appointed
[1:43:05] sorry the foola said in his heart there
[1:43:08] is no God you sir have to fulfill that
[1:43:11] scripture
[1:43:13] right that's why preaching
[1:43:16] predestination is a no no among un
[1:43:23] seed you get it because they want to say
[1:43:25] I got a choice well some of you
[1:43:33] don't now we just have to look at it
[1:43:35] according to the scripture amen
[1:43:39] okay 1 John 3
[1:43:42] 9-12 in this the children of God are
[1:43:45] manifest and the children of the devil
[1:43:49] children of God Children of the devil
[1:43:51] devil whosoever do doeth not
[1:43:54] righteousness is not of God neither he
[1:43:58] that loveth not his brother not his King
[1:44:02] who was of the wicked one and slew his
[1:44:04] brother he was a murderer to begin with
[1:44:07] why his father's a murderer amen yes
[1:44:10] amen and wherefore he slew his brother
[1:44:12] because his own
[1:44:13] Works were
[1:44:16] evil and his brothers righteous Romans
[1:44:19] 9: 21 and
[1:44:22] 22 hath not the Potter power over the
[1:44:25] clay of the same lump to make one vessel
[1:44:27] unto honor and another under
[1:44:30] dishonor huh what if God show willing to
[1:44:34] show his wrath to make his power known
[1:44:37] endured with much long suffering the
[1:44:39] vessels of Wrath what are they fitted to
[1:44:44] destruction they're made for it in fact
[1:44:47] I'll tell you what brother Brenham said
[1:44:49] and he said it may not be real nice to
[1:44:51] say it but he said some of them are
[1:44:53] Canon fodder what he said he said some
[1:44:56] are Atomic fodder right they're going to
[1:44:59] be
[1:45:02] ashes let me give you the quote amen
[1:45:05] true sign Overlook 61 I walk down the
[1:45:09] street and saw these people you talk to
[1:45:11] them they laugh at you make fun of you

[1:46:44] Foundation of God standeth sure having
[1:46:47] this seal the Lord knoweth them that are
[1:46:49] his am amen but in a great house there
[1:46:52] are not only vessels of gold and of
[1:46:54] silver and also of wood and Earth and
[1:46:57] some to honor and some to dishonor I'm
[1:47:01] sorry some are
[1:47:03] made dishonorable
[1:47:05] vessels and we're seeing more and more
[1:47:08] of them in the
[1:47:09] news and we're seeing them so far out
[1:47:14] you can actually think how did we get
[1:47:16] here this isn't even normal thing
[1:47:23] uh Jude
[1:47:25] 4 for there are certain men crept inw
[1:47:28] who were before of old ordained to this
[1:47:31] condemnation right ungodly man turning
[1:47:36] the grace of our God into lasciviousness
[1:47:38] and denying the only Lord God and our
[1:47:40] Lord Jesus
[1:47:42] Christ so we're talking about people
[1:47:44] like Cain like Esau like Pharaoh like
[1:47:48] the Beatles yep
[1:47:51] born sons of predition let me give you a
[1:47:53] quote on that in the sermon the token
[1:47:56] 1964 and these teenage of nonsense and
[1:48:00] rock and roll and things that we're
[1:48:01] going
[1:48:02] through all these here beetles and
[1:48:06] bugs do you know that's all represented
[1:48:08] here in the book in the
[1:48:11] Bible says it in Revelation they are
[1:48:14] dead they can't
[1:48:16] rise they never were eternal
[1:48:21] they wasn't even in the
[1:48:24] thinking so they'll
[1:48:28] perish they'll be done forever totally
[1:48:34] annihilated
[1:48:37] wow they'll be punished for eons of time
[1:48:40] for what they've done but anything that
[1:48:43] had a beginning hasn't
[1:48:47] end now let me show you because because
[1:48:50] we want to give you a
[1:48:53] scriptural definition of
[1:48:55] God
[1:48:57] choosing who he wants to love and show
[1:49:00] his grace and mercy to and the other one
[1:49:02] he hates in Romans 9: 11-8 for the
[1:49:07] children being not yet
[1:49:11] born neither having done any good or
[1:49:15] evil for the purpose of God according to
[1:49:18] election might stand
[1:49:20] not of works but of him that
[1:49:24] calleth it was said unto her the Elder
[1:49:26] Shall Serve the younger and it was
[1:49:29] written Jacob have I loved and Esau have
[1:49:31] I hated in fact God had to
[1:49:37] correct he had to
[1:49:40] correct Isaac because Isaac loved Esau
[1:49:44] more than
[1:49:46] Jacob he had to come out and tell
[1:49:49] him Esau have I
[1:49:59] hated what shall we see then is there
[1:50:01] unrighteousness with God Hey listen if
[1:50:04] he's the author of the book doesn't the
[1:50:07] author of the book have the right to put
[1:50:08] the bad guy in there and he in the
[1:50:11] end he's toast
[1:50:16] right oh well you you I just don't like
[1:50:19] that bad guy meeting a bad end you ought
[1:50:21] to you know do something sorry I'm the
[1:50:23] author that's how he wrote
[1:50:27] it what shall we say then is there
[1:50:29] unrighteousness with God for he saith to
[1:50:32] Moses I will have mercy on whom I will
[1:50:34] have
[1:50:35] mercy and I will have compassion on whom
[1:50:38] I will have compassion so it's not of
[1:50:40] him that willth nor of him that runneth
[1:50:43] but of God that showeth Mercy for the
[1:50:45] scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for
[1:50:48] the same purpose have I raised thee up
[1:50:51] that I might show my power in
[1:50:54] thee and that my name might be declared
[1:50:56] throughout all the Earth amen amen
[1:50:59] Pharaoh sorry buddy but I Rose you
[1:51:06] up so God's going to give Mercy onto
[1:51:10] whom he will and to whom he doesn't he
[1:51:15] doesn't
[1:51:16] some I'm
[1:51:18] sorry and maybe you've never heard this
[1:51:21] before but some are predestinated to go
[1:51:23] to hell they have no choice right there
[1:51:26] was nothing in them there is non
[1:51:29] seed they have no ability there is no
[1:51:33] sounding post there is no reciprocation
[1:51:37] there is no ear to hear there is no eye
[1:51:39] to
[1:51:40] see
[1:51:42] right and guess what God can't deal with
[1:51:44] them because they're illegitimate
[1:51:46] children do you think he corrects them
[1:51:49] he don't waste his time
[1:51:51] time only a Son of God only genealogy
[1:51:54] that's his my sheep know my voice
[1:51:57] stranger they won't
[1:52:01] follow so the Book of Life let's talk
[1:52:03] about the book of life because the Book
[1:52:06] of the Dead and Sinners and
[1:52:11] that I went to a I went to a Mexican
[1:52:15] food restaurant the other
[1:52:17] day what is it called the bar
[1:52:20] Easter bario something bario over here
[1:52:24] off of the freeway Sandy and I went
[1:52:27] there everything around it all
[1:52:29] skulls skulls
[1:52:33] dead I said is this place got good food
[1:52:36] it looks like you're advertising the
[1:52:40] otherwise am I going to die eating this
[1:52:42] stuff cuz there were skulls
[1:52:46] everywhere worshiping the Deads anyway I
[1:52:51] you see any first and last time to eat
[1:52:53] there okay look book of
[1:52:57] life thank you book of life let's go
[1:52:59] into that these are the Justified
[1:53:04] Sanctified yet they lack the baptism of
[1:53:06] the Holy Ghost foolish virgin they are
[1:53:09] the sheep that show up at White Throne
[1:53:11] judgment and they will live outside the
[1:53:14] new New
[1:53:16] Jerusalem and some like Judas
[1:53:21] showed their colors and reject the word
[1:53:23] and they're doing it in this message
[1:53:26] now remember I said reject the word make
[1:53:30] fun of it speak against it get these
[1:53:34] chat things and YouTubes and why I left
[1:53:36] the
[1:53:38] message and their names are blotted
[1:53:44] out blott it
[1:53:48] out
[1:53:50] now there are
[1:53:52] others foolish virgin who never got the
[1:53:55] Holy
[1:53:56] Ghost
[1:53:58] right and so they lack the wisdom that
[1:54:01] the Holy Ghost in leading them and
[1:54:03] guiding them into all truth they're not
[1:54:06] diligent about keeping themselves ready
[1:54:08] for the coming of the Lord my Lord
[1:54:10] delays his coming right and they are
[1:54:15] foolish now they are saved but not
[1:54:19] adopted
[1:54:20] amen right they are saved but not
[1:54:25] sealed because when you are sealed you
[1:54:27] are sealed until the day of your
[1:54:29] Redemption amen
[1:54:31] amen that's doctrinal teaching yes
[1:54:36] so
[1:54:43] um I'm going to say this and then I will
[1:54:45] go back a little bit later and and
[1:54:49] declare a little a little bit about you
[1:54:51] about this they were saved before the
[1:54:54] lamb leaves The Mercy
[1:54:59] Seat because we're going to go into some
[1:55:01] doctrinal teaching here in a little bit
[1:55:04] to just show you some stuff uh now
[1:55:07] brother Fernando Torres who's been a
[1:55:09] really special guy with a gift and he
[1:55:13] can make grass for me he went ahead and
[1:55:16] just the last couple Services he said
[1:55:19] hey further on I think I'm going to make
[1:55:20] you a little graph I'm going to send it
[1:55:22] to you so he made a picture would you go
[1:55:23] ahead and show the first one here of the
[1:55:25] record of the wheat
[1:55:28] plant now if you guys all see
[1:55:35] that says not all of the we plant was
[1:55:39] seed cuz remember there is Shu that's
[1:55:41] not even air but it's all the record of
[1:55:45] the church when you understand brother
[1:55:47] R's teaching says names can can be
[1:55:49] blotted out for rejecting the word Judas
[1:55:52] I like how he put Judas and he put a red
[1:55:54] x on it his name blotted out some are
[1:55:57] allowed to enter into the kingdom for
[1:56:00] being kind to God's elect to the
[1:56:04] bride
[1:56:07] right see they'll be
[1:56:10] given eternal life because they did
[1:56:13] something for the bride before the bride
[1:56:16] is
[1:56:18] gone think of this I I just stirring
[1:56:21] your mind here a little bit I'm just
[1:56:22] playing with you a little
[1:56:24] bit you think they're going to be saved
[1:56:28] just at White Throne
[1:56:30] judgment because all of a sudden they'll
[1:56:32] come over to you and say hey y don't you
[1:56:35] remember the time and I I want to be
[1:56:36] good to you and you know come on please
[1:56:38] no no no no no no right they were good
[1:56:40] to the bride before the bride left
[1:56:42] before the blood left The Mercy Seat
[1:56:44] before the sacrifice was done before the
[1:56:46] Gentile day was closed because when the
[1:56:49] time of the Gentiles is over blood
[1:56:51] leaves The Mercy Seat it becomes
[1:56:53] judgment seat and the lamb becomes the
[1:56:56] lion yes judgment strikes bride goes
[1:57:02] up in the days of the
[1:57:07] Gentiles
[1:57:09] Pho
[1:57:11] done if you didn't get in before that
[1:57:14] time you ain't getting in because even
[1:57:18] that white throne judgement you're going
[1:57:20] to be judged for what you did back then
[1:57:23] before blood left The Mercy Seat that's
[1:57:32] right doctrinal
[1:57:35] teaching because brother Brena
[1:57:37] multitudes of
[1:57:39] time once that last Gentile comes in and
[1:57:44] the day of Grace is
[1:57:46] over and he said there'll not be another
[1:57:49] one saved am is that what he said take
[1:57:53] his doctrinal teaching yes sir amen and
[1:57:56] he said there'll be a time period after
[1:57:58] the last ones come in and maybe a period
[1:58:00] of time of grace and the church goes
[1:58:03] right on thinking everybody's getting
[1:58:04] saved and he said they not already been
[1:58:07] sealed the do already been
[1:58:09] closed that's why brother Bram said and
[1:58:12] I can show you quote after quote
[1:58:14] whatever you do get in
[1:58:17] now get in now cuz when you get over
[1:58:20] there it's too late yes and once he
[1:58:23] leaves The Mercy Seat and it becomes
[1:58:25] judgment and it changes from lamb to
[1:58:29] Lion there'll not be no more salvation
[1:58:33] for the Gentiles that's right God turns
[1:58:35] and goes to the Jews you understand so
[1:58:39] even the foolish virgin for the three
[1:58:42] and a half years of tribulation and they
[1:58:44] have to be
[1:58:47] martyred are they going to get saved
[1:58:50] because they did something in the three
[1:58:52] and 1/2 years of
[1:58:54] tribulation
[1:58:56] no
[1:58:58] why they're being judged because of how
[1:59:00] foolish they were with what they knew to
[1:59:03] do and they didn't do it so he said so
[1:59:06] I've got to purge him right and now
[1:59:09] there's no more blood but because
[1:59:10] without the shedding of blood there is
[1:59:12] no
[1:59:14] sacrifice right and so now what blood
[1:59:17] because blood's left the mercy
[1:59:22] SE it's
[1:59:25] over so whose blood has to be it's their
[1:59:30] blood by the blood of their own
[1:59:32] testimony right but the Salvation listen
[1:59:36] to me
[1:59:38] carefully came
[1:59:40] before he left the mercy
[1:59:43] seat right amen so when they show up as
[1:59:48] sheep among goats at White Throne I want
[1:59:50] to ask you God's sheep why are God's
[1:59:53] sheep there at White
[1:59:57] Throne are they granted
[2:00:00] salvation at White
[2:00:03] Throne
[2:00:06] no they were already
[2:00:09] sheep because we want to take the
[2:00:11] doctrinal
[2:00:12] teachings of what he said now let me go
[2:00:15] into
[2:00:18] this
[2:00:20] okay very nice they are
[2:00:25] predestinated
[2:00:27] oh then they ask about when was I naked
[2:00:30] you clothed me when was I hungry and you
[2:00:32] fed
[2:00:33] me okay remember this is second
[2:00:36] Resurrection you guys see that right
[2:00:38] here second
[2:00:42] Resurrection
[2:00:43] okay so this is the record of the wheat
[2:00:48] The Book of Life why white
[2:00:50] Throne remember all of the Dead came
[2:00:53] before the white throne and was judged
[2:00:56] both great and small bride is she judged
[2:01:00] at White
[2:01:01] Throne no Doctrine no you're not going
[2:01:04] to be judged at White Throne okay let's
[2:01:06] let's go on now with with some more of
[2:01:08] this um let's go to the Lamb's Book of
[2:01:12] Life Now understand it's an
[2:01:16] extension or an addendum of the original
[2:01:19] book of
[2:01:22] life only the elect or the
[2:01:25] predestinated and ordained seed can be
[2:01:29] recorded in that book they are
[2:01:31] sealed to the day of their Redemption
[2:01:34] their names cannot be stricken off that
[2:01:36] book brother Brenham said because it's
[2:01:39] WR their names are written in his
[2:01:43] blood Book of Life you can have your
[2:01:45] name taken on Lamb's Book of Life
[2:01:49] predestinated elected you were there you
[2:01:51] were with him you were in him there's no
[2:01:53] way that yes
[2:01:56] sir I could get real excited and start
[2:01:59] come on brother
[2:02:01] amen
[2:02:05] yes so here's Lamb's Book of Life Look
[2:02:08] At
[2:02:10] This Book of Life The Royal seed
[2:02:15] section the
[2:02:17] DNA the seed gen of God yes you
[2:02:21] understand that this is God's choosing
[2:02:24] his
[2:02:26] election and let's look at this God's
[2:02:31] attributes in the mind of
[2:02:34] God if you are a son of God you always
[2:02:38] were a Son of God now we're I want to go
[2:02:41] beyond just calling I want to go to
[2:02:47] election
[2:02:51] the record of the great Royal seed
[2:02:53] Samson Moses David Abel Abraham Noah
[2:02:56] Peter Joseph Paul Jeremiah John Luther
[2:03:01] Wesley on and on chosen
[2:03:04] win before the foundation of the
[2:03:07] world they are Zoe God's own life
[2:03:10] eternal
[2:03:12] life moreover whom he did
[2:03:15] predestinate them he also called whom he
[2:03:17] called he Justified whom he justified
[2:03:20] them he
[2:03:23] glorified I want to ask you who can lay
[2:03:25] any sin to the charge of God's
[2:03:30] elect neither life nor death nor
[2:03:33] principality nor things present nor
[2:03:35] things to come shall be able to separate
[2:03:38] you from the love of God why you've been
[2:03:41] United with your your king and it's been
[2:03:45] an invisible Union and once you've had
[2:03:47] that invisible Union
[2:03:49] you are united with him and you stand as
[2:03:52] him and he cannot be judged a second
[2:03:55] time why he already was judged for your
[2:04:00] sin he became me that I might become
[2:04:05] him
[2:04:07] Hallelujah names can
[2:04:10] never be blotted
[2:04:12] out Hallelujah blessed be the name the
[2:04:17] Lord here's the problem et's doctrinal
[2:04:20] teaching the elect bride can never have
[2:04:23] her name stricken off of the Lamb's Book
[2:04:25] of
[2:04:28] Life in nonseed there is nothing to
[2:04:33] Quicken now I want to show you we're
[2:04:35] going to go to some quotes here now for
[2:04:37] just a moment and your brethren I'm
[2:04:39] skipping a little bit here now so we're
[2:04:41] under the one called The Book of Life
[2:04:44] and here are some questions this let's
[2:04:45] go to the patas vision so if you'll find
[2:04:48] the quote on Pat Miss
[2:04:51] Vision 1960 now there's another question
[2:04:55] here that was given me last
[2:04:57] evening brother brandom are the five
[2:05:00] foolish virgins of Matthew
[2:05:03] 25 counted as the Gentile
[2:05:07] Remnant now you have to understand your
[2:05:09] Bible and you have to understand this
[2:05:11] question and if you all go look at
[2:05:13] Matthew 25 you'll understand the context
[2:05:17] of this question
[2:05:19] I understand that the five foolish
[2:05:21] virgins were saved but have to go
[2:05:24] through the Great Tribulation
[2:05:26] period is this
[2:05:28] correct if so what will be their final
[2:05:32] destination could they be the Sheep
[2:05:35] which are divided from the goats in
[2:05:36] Matthew
[2:05:38] 2533 and 34 brother brenaman pretty good
[2:05:43] Theologian I think it too that they are
[2:05:46] the remnant sleeping virgin is the
[2:05:48] Remnant spoken
[2:05:50] of in Revelation a woman will take a
[2:05:53] piece of goods lay it down well now
[2:05:56] that's uh what she's cutting she takes
[2:05:58] her pattern lays anywhere she
[2:06:02] Desires in which way she's going to cut
[2:06:05] that then that which is left over is
[2:06:07] called The
[2:06:09] Remnant and she chooses to cut it from a
[2:06:11] certain place by her own free thinking
[2:06:14] that's what left over is the
[2:06:17] remnant right amen now there is a place
[2:06:20] where brother Brandon what he he uses
[2:06:24] the bride and he uses the name Remnant
[2:06:27] well we know that's the remnant well
[2:06:29] according to his doctrinal teaching no
[2:06:31] bride is not Remnant right foolish
[2:06:34] virgin is Remnant right okay
[2:06:37] so uh here's questions answers on the
[2:06:40] seals after the Rapture has taken place
[2:06:43] raptures taking place up the gun and a
[2:06:46] moment in twinkling of an eye
[2:06:49] will any of the church be saved in the
[2:06:51] end who was not taken in the
[2:06:56] Rapture no uhuh what Rapture is taking
[2:07:00] place anybody going to be getting saved
[2:07:02] Gentile dea's Grace is
[2:07:07] over cuz the blood's done left yeah you
[2:07:10] see there'll be no intercessions the
[2:07:13] Gentile age is
[2:07:14] finished there'll be no one saved after
[2:07:17] the Rapture
[2:07:19] none of the church so let me just pop
[2:07:22] your bubble if some of you are saying
[2:07:24] well you know what I I I just may be
[2:07:27] foolish virgin let me tell you you
[2:07:29] better get right and get saved here
[2:07:33] now
[2:07:35] amen because after the Rapture ain't
[2:07:37] nobody getting
[2:07:40] saved none of the church that won't take
[2:07:43] place not after the church is gone now
[2:07:46] again there's where he puts church and
[2:07:48] bride and he he should have said bride
[2:07:50] but I'm not going to say that I'm just
[2:07:52] going to say we all
[2:07:54] know church amen so here 1964 after the
[2:07:59] bride is
[2:08:00] raptured will any of the foolish virgin
[2:08:03] be saved or will they all be
[2:08:07] lost now understand as he reads these
[2:08:10] questions there's two or three so he's
[2:08:13] answering maybe the second question
[2:08:15] after he just read the first
[2:08:18] because you see he he said after the
[2:08:20] brightest Rapture will any of the
[2:08:21] foolish virgin be saved or will they all
[2:08:25] be
[2:08:25] lost now his doctrine of teaching yes
[2:08:28] she's
[2:08:30] saved yes
[2:08:31] amen she is saved yes so when he answers
[2:08:35] it
[2:08:36] no he's answering no to or will they all
[2:08:39] be lost no they'll not be
[2:08:41] lost see everything will be finished for
[2:08:44] the Gentile church when the bride is
[2:08:45] taken from the earth spirit of God
[2:08:47] leaves the Earth
[2:08:49] he that's filthy is filthy still he
[2:08:50] that's righteous righteous still he
[2:08:52] that's holy holy still right Sanctuary
[2:08:55] becomes Smokey attorney stands to pleed
[2:08:57] the case Christ leaves the sanctuary his
[2:09:00] day of mediatorial is over the Rapture
[2:09:03] comes he leaves from the sanctuary Goes
[2:09:06] Forth takes the book of redemption and
[2:09:08] this is going to be interesting because
[2:09:10] I'm going to Branch off into this what
[2:09:12] book is it that he has in his right hand
[2:09:17] yeah what is this title deed of
[2:09:19] redemption that Adam lost right we're
[2:09:23] going to
[2:09:24] look at a closer look at the book that's
[2:09:27] taken and why do you got to eat it and
[2:09:30] he claims everything he
[2:09:32] redeemed there's no more mediatorial
[2:09:35] word yes times of the Gentiles is over
[2:09:39] uhhuh uh the dispensation
[2:09:42] ceased God returns back to the
[2:09:46] Jews blood leaves a mercy seat turns to
[2:09:49] judgment lamb turns to a
[2:09:52] lion at that time there will not be
[2:09:54] another Gentile
[2:09:58] sa whoever gets saved gets saved now
[2:10:03] amen before the Rapture
[2:10:09] amen Mary's belief 1959 remember this is
[2:10:13] the ending of the Gentile dispensation
[2:10:15] remember it's thus sayith the Lord It's
[2:10:18] a time for the Gentiles age to cease and
[2:10:20] when the Gentile age ceases then the
[2:10:23] gospel goes to the Jew and it's all over
[2:10:27] then
[2:10:29] wow 1964 questions and answers will the
[2:10:32] foolish virgin be saved no whatever
[2:10:34] happens happens
[2:10:36] now somebody say now
[2:10:39] now after that time she's in that state
[2:10:42] now she will go through the tribulation
[2:10:45] period and that's the reason of it is is
[2:10:47] we can because she rejected the
[2:10:49] atonement in its
[2:10:51] fullness she is a Believer a professed
[2:10:54] believer she'll have to go through the
[2:10:56] tribulation
[2:10:59] period brother Brenham told Billy Paul
[2:11:01] he said Billy whatever you
[2:11:03] do you want to miss
[2:11:06] that yes you want to miss that
[2:11:13] tribulation now let me finish up with a
[2:11:17] couple quotes here on again I'm going to
[2:11:20] take a little bit more time is that okay
[2:11:22] because I I want to be finished with
[2:11:25] this in Revelations 13 and Revelations
[2:11:29] 21 it talks about Lamb's Book of Life
[2:11:31] Revelations 13: 7 and 8 and all that
[2:11:35] dwell on the Earth shall worship Him
[2:11:36] whose names are not written in the life
[2:11:40] of the Lamb the book of the life of the
[2:11:42] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[2:11:44] world do you know even foolish virgin
[2:11:46] because they're foolish because they
[2:11:48] don't have the wisdom and discernment of
[2:11:50] the holy spirit will have a part of
[2:11:59] that that's where right wrong kind of
[2:12:04] worship
[2:12:06] anyway Revelations 21:
[2:12:11] 27 shall in no wise enter in anything
[2:12:14] that
[2:12:15] defileth neither whatsoever worketh
[2:12:20] Abomination or I'm going to paraphrase
[2:12:23] that and say who weareth
[2:12:29] Abomination if a woman wears clothes
[2:12:32] pertaining to a
[2:12:35] man it's an
[2:12:37] Abomination is that right it's your
[2:12:41] Bible now sis which one of you are going
[2:12:44] to say it's okay I'll wear I'll just
[2:12:45] wear uh pair of pants with when I'm you
[2:12:49] know when I go play
[2:12:52] tennis when I go
[2:12:54] skiing when I go horp
[2:12:57] writing
[2:12:58] huh what if you can't do it in the skirt
[2:13:01] don't do
[2:13:04] it oh yeah I know you're thinking I'm
[2:13:07] getting too
[2:13:12] hard neither whatsoever worketh
[2:13:15] abominate or maketh a lie lying is as
[2:13:19] bad as an Abomination a little white lie
[2:13:22] it's
[2:13:23] okay yeah but they which are written in
[2:13:27] the Lamb's Book of Life here's the
[2:13:29] prophet's doctrinal teaching concerning
[2:13:31] Lamb's Book of
[2:13:33] Life sardian Church age 284 now we can
[2:13:37] see why the redeemed bought back by the
[2:13:41] original owner the redeemed he now says
[2:13:45] bride parentheses she was
[2:13:48] in him as Eve was in
[2:13:52] Adam cannot ever have her member names
[2:13:55] taken off of the record amen that's
[2:13:58] right she's part of
[2:14:00] him she is in the throne yes she can
[2:14:03] never be judged every one of the bright
[2:14:06] is a member of him and he loses
[2:14:11] none
[2:14:14] Hallelujah
[2:14:16] yes but that that's not so concerning
[2:14:19] the
[2:14:20] all in the Book of Life for amongst them
[2:14:23] are even those like Judas who have a
[2:14:26] part in the record but their names are
[2:14:29] removed Jesus will say that he never
[2:14:32] knew
[2:14:33] them they were not forn as in the bride
[2:14:37] and neither were they forn as among the
[2:14:40] righteous of the second
[2:14:42] Resurrection second
[2:14:45] Resurrection blessed are they who are
[2:14:49] partakers of what the first resurrection
[2:14:51] what's first resurrection
[2:14:53] Rapture and the rest of the
[2:14:56] Dead live not for what Thousand Years
[2:14:59] thousand years when do they show up
[2:15:03] white thrown
[2:15:05] judgment that's where the Sheep come up
[2:15:07] they have no other court of appeal they
[2:15:10] miss the
[2:15:13] Rapture then as we have previously shown
[2:15:18] there are those who stood for the bride
[2:15:21] and were an aid and comfort to
[2:15:23] her those had their names remaining on
[2:15:26] the book of life and go into life
[2:15:30] Everlasting finally there are those such
[2:15:32] as pharaoh who never had their names on
[2:15:35] on the book of life and these are cast
[2:15:37] in the Lake of Fire
[2:15:39] also brother randam in the sermon I will
[2:15:43] restore watch those two
[2:15:45] Vines Jesus said let them grow together
[2:15:49] I want you to notice another place we
[2:15:50] could bring Esau and Jacob if you wanted
[2:15:52] to before either was born God Ela J

[2:16:58] days that religious enemy would get
[2:17:00] amongst the people and have
[2:17:01] organizations and so forth and Cults as

[2:23:17] one Abram was changed to Abram Sarah to
[2:23:21] Sarah Jacob to Israel Simon to Peter
[2:23:25] Saul to
[2:23:27] Paul these names either brought about a
[2:23:31] change or were given

[2:23:42] change it was only after Abram and Sarah
[2:23:45] had their names Changed by by the Lord
[2:23:47] that they had made ready to to receive
[2:23:50] the coming son in Jacob's case he had to
[2:23:53] overcome and then he was called a prince
