wanted me to remind everyone particularly our youth the youth banquet registration will close tonight at midnight so if you're planning on going to the youth banquet and you haven't registered you've got an another couple hours after service closes tonight so be sure to get that done another eagle has landed I think they've got a couple pictures for us brother Christopher Sister Christian Romine had a little baby girl yesterday guys yeah there we go Ariana Elaine was born yesterday in 9 55 a.m seven pounds two ounces and 21 inches long so unless the Romine family amen God is good to each one of us brother Ron has an update on brother William Silva's brother Ron if you want to get them soon God bless you all this evening greets you in the lovely name of Jesus Christ couple announcements here to just kind of keep you updated and brother Johnny Green come on up here for just a second come on up because brother Johnny has been in charge he's you have a go-to guy when we have ordered fiber optics to be brought to the church and if you know anything about the technical and of fiber versus regular hardwire for streaming fiber optics is like a flamethrower man it's like a fire hydrant brother Johnny is our go-to guy we've been working on this for months brother Johnny come give us an update on where we're at on that it's going to be great there's a box right out front that they installed a couple months ago that will serve 14 000 customers the fiber optic system is so much more advanced than cable system and we are so looking forward to faster speeds for our archiving and for our streaming services and Wi-Fi everything it's just going to be awesome and we just can't wait to get it hopefully by the end of the week or maybe into next week it'll be completed they've been using boring and that's my Landscaping out there by the way and I've been watching over that and they mess it up one time they said they wouldn't do it again but anyway uh I I really appreciate working with them guys they're very very nice and I've already invited several to church given out some books and can't help it but it's going to be great and I'm really looking forward to it and if anybody has any questions you can always text me or call me and we'll try to get this soon as possible thank you very much yes sister Carolyn was asking me she was at she works in the front desk there and they have the technology that they go ahead and some people uh still require to get a CD or whatever because they can't stream or whatever would and she said brother Ron we just can't do it like we used to now some of you what happened is our bandwidth now this is my terminology the bandwidth became so diluted because so many of you had the password and the Wi-Fi capability that you could get on your cell phone and we had people that even during service are texting and checking and on the Internet or whatever and I hope that our deacons if they catch you they confiscate your phone give it back to you after service but I am appealing to your heart first and say hey don't do that during service so what they did is they went ahead and they gave it only to a small group of people that needed for to help with our we're streaming now this last service this last service four or five times we had streaming difficulty I don't know why we could have them come up here and give you the whys and where floors of it but I don't know now we are aware that there are streaming difficulties um and I don't know if you've ever been out of town and you tried to stream in and the thing buffers and you it keeps losing signal to me that's totally frustrating and that's that's not acceptable period I see little small much smaller churches than us and you get on theirs and boy it just streams is good good picture it works well so I'm I'm appealing to my technical team fix it no more excuses especially when we get this uh is it our computers is it our systems if we're in if we've got the technology way back that's old let's fix it that's all I want to give you all the best possibility of the best product that we possibly can get so the first thing is is to bring in the fiber optic and Monday about eight or nine o'clock Johnny was over here and got with the technicians that are boring out there and bringing it into and it's going to be in our technical room here right near the men's restroom over here in women's restroom right here on the corner and he went in there and they they know now where they're going to put their boxes he's our go-to guy once they say we're ready to bring it into your church he's our go-to guy he'll come over unlock bring him in there they'll set it up and then brother yes and all of the technical team who do the the the streaming and the archiving and all of that then they will go ahead and do their work and it may take a week or two to get everything back up and the way that it should be so uh we will uh we will be patient as we possibly can be to have that repaired and fixed as soon as possible um so uh I wanted to introduce too we have uh brother John and sister Roseanne McCafferty where are you guys stand up and I want your children to stand up everybody everybody knows Emily yeah and so they have moved here God bless you and they have moved here and they got here a couple days ago and are and we're going to need some help I think tomorrow uh tomorrow afternoon through the evening one of their big uh U-Haul trucks or something shows up tomorrow if there can be some of you there I know we've got a few that have already said they'd come but please be good if nothing else you can go over there and help direct traffic even if you can't carry boxes uh but anyway God bless you brother John sister Roseanne uh everybody now knows because it's funny everybody says oh Emily that's your appearance I should have had Emily come up here and she'd say well here are my parents because the parents are saying uh oh everybody that meets us says oh you're Emily's Mom and Dad so uh anyway praise the Lord we're glad that you're here and may God richly bless you may uh may this be a place very special in your hearts and we welcome you to our family here at evening Light Fellowship we are just so blessed to have you guys here um also I'm going to give you an update on brother uh Billy Silva brother Billy Silva uh let me find this here uh brother Ernesto went ahead now what happened is and let me just tell you kind of how this evolved brother Billy took a couple Brothers over the Border they were just visiting they said hey I'm going to take you guys for some real Mexican tacos so they crossed Nogales there at the border and he forgotten he had a nine millimeter pistol in his glove box and they found it guess what all three got in trouble they got put in jail and that was in about mid-December and now I did call Brother Abel Silva and brother Abel Silva um he told me he said brother Ron I've talked to my son I was there there's nothing we can do there's nothing you tell the church he repeated it twice there's nothing you can do to get him out of there and he said just pray well I'm one of these guys it's kind of like the two guys in the boat they're out fishing offshore in their little row boat storms coming up one brother looks oh there's a storm coming let's pray and have the storm go around us so we can continue fishing the other brother says well I'll tell you what you start praying and I'll start rowing I feel the same way I there are things in me as an example and I told her brethren in the back room Jesus was crucified and nobody asked for the body of Jesus so he could be prepared and put into a grave who was it you remember Joseph of armathea thank God for Joseph because he was a man of wealth and he went before the government hey will you release the body so we can prepare it for the Sabbath and so he went and guess what he placed him in his own tomb it was a borrowed tomb he wasn't going to need it but for three days but what I'm saying saints of God now the Lord dealt with me at three o'clock here just a week or so ago and at three in the morning it just come to me I was wide awake and the Holy Spirit is saying what are you doing with those that are in prison an immediate thought of brother Billy and I hung my head and I said nothing because I did speak to with brother Abel and uh he said there's nothing you can do just pray well I didn't feel that that's enough and I thought I it was impressed on me that we need to do something and I'm the type person that even if somebody tells no I'm going to exhaust all my resources because if it was you I don't care which one of you if it was you in prison we're not going to sit here as a body and just say well let's pray for him Lord bless him Lord feed him Lord give him warmth Lord you see I'm saying no somebody somebody go and seek from The Authority so years ago I went to a brother down I preached several conventions down in Mexico and he worked for the governor down there and he knows men in high positions he said brother Ron you keep this card it was a little business card of the governor of that province in Mexico this is a get out of jail for free card you keep this and if you get in trouble in any way you call well I kept it for years how often do I go to Mexico very little and it's one of those cards that finally starts wearing out and you look in your well now I tossed it but I knew who gave it to me and it was a brother down there in Mexico I called him I said and he said brother Ron yes yes I'll get right on it within 15 minutes he had a lawyer already contacted see people in position they know people it's not what you know it's who you know and he says I'll get right on it next thing you know Hey so uh I sent this to my board let me read it to you excuse me for taking a little bit of time um so uh I can't read it in Spanish because I'm not fluent in Spanish I sent it to my board um here it is also uh this comes from the brother it was translated from Spanish to English God bless you my brother Ron I tell you that people from the government of hamasio have been spoken to and they are evaluating the case positively the lawyer that we sent because we hired a lawyer I I went ahead upon myself and I said look I'll pay the the cost send the lawyer down there put her on a retainer get her down there pay for her plane ticket five days into Motel food everything do it uh I'll take care of it so uh the lawyer that we sent will be there on Friday morning January 13th and we'll contact the uh the brother Abel Silva in the afternoon of that day to receive some documents and begin his tasks on the 16th with the federal courts there in Mexico they have also had contact with the lawyer because there was a um a court appointed lawyer well unfortunately a court appointed lawyer down there is not going to fight for you much huh and so anyway they weren't really doing much in fact we they spoke to the court appointed lawyer and said well we can't do nothing I'm going on vacation won't be back till June 26th June are you kidding me so anyway don't take note for an answer there is another way to do it so let's hey you know let's keep knocking on doors okay until we get an answer um uh they have also made contact with the lawyer of that place and we hope to make some appeals so that everything goes smoothly we trust God is handling of our friend in the government God bless you uh thank you for your prayers and praying for him if there's something else I will keep you informed amen um okay brother Austin Johnson come up here because it was on his heart okay uh he said brother Ron can because Brother David Rutledge and different ones brother Ron can we can we give some money let's take up an offering and well you don't just take money and throw it something you want to know how much is it what are we looking at and come on up here Austin and uh uh so uh somebody said well what about a GoFundMe page would you tell us about a GoFundMe page here I don't know if that's high enough that works it works uh God bless you Saints so um brother Amos reached out to me because brother yeah that works better um brother Amos had reached out to me when I was in Atlanta with my mom and when I was flying back um about setting up a GoFundMe basically it's it's fairly simple um it's it's just a page explaining the situation and everything and it's got links and whatnot so for example a lot of you have social media Instagrams you have friends and you know people you know there's a lot of we could probably get probably easily over ten thousand people to see the link if we just shared it with the people in the church and basically if someone feels it on their heart if a thousand people gave five bucks that's five grand so in assuming like if we don't need the money we can refund it through GoFundMe it's pretty easy um so yeah uh brother Amos had asked me to set that up so it is ready to go just whenever brother Ron wants to use it um also make sure I'm not managing the funds we'll have an elder to it so yeah but that's that's the basics so it's ready to go just whenever we need to use it it's already up whenever you want it uh no I was gonna talk to yes about getting it set up on our church website and whatnot we'll connect with that yeah uh both that's fine that's fine and quite honestly I'll probably put it when ever you want I'll just put it in the senior use chat because like everybody in their hustle should be so you guys can link it out to your friends and whatever and that's fine yeah praise the Lord so some of you are asking what can we do uh we will have uh get it out there to you um this GoFundMe page there and uh listen we don't know at this time how much the The Mexican government is going to ask we've asked essentially they said between 20 and 30 000 to try to expedite to get him out we don't know now we're praying that hey God give us yes Sandy yeah yeah there there's you see do you see they say the faster you get this thing done the better off you are because the longer you stay in jail down there let me give you an example if it would have been a 45 caliber pistol and not a nine millimeter it's a minimum of 15 years mandatory jail sentence because that's what the drug cartel now he's being used right now as a political Pawn because right now the borders are closed in New Mexico because guess what El Chapo's son just got arrested and and they're killing people it's on your news right so here's a political pawn and and it's right at the time if this would have happened several months ago he'd got a slap on a hand a fine of a couple thousand dollars uh confiscate the gun turn around tell him okay your blacklisted can't come to Mexico again something like that so what I'm saying is that's giving you all of an idea of where we're at and if it was you if it was you believe me I want to do everything I can for my sheep to just say uh hey I am not going to take no for an answer and I'm going to knock on all doors and once I have exhausted all options yes of course I believe in praying the whole time but I do believe that we too as a body of Christ can do something it's maybe knowing somebody and if this lawyer comes in and she's already said uh I've found where they've they have broken the law he's an American citizen etc etc and he should be out and whatever but I was told by uh brother Abel Silva he's doing well he is in a newer prison uh he gets three good meals a day he has he's able to work out an hour a day and to take a shower every day so uh praise the Lord for that hey uh because the horror stories I have heard of some of the places down in Mexico that you could be held um so anyway we will continue to pray I'm going to keep you guys up updated uh as we know okay now let's all uh Stan I'm going to turn it over to uh brother Mark he's going to have a sing I told um brother Stephen McNeely it's a good thing you're preaching tonight because I said I've had so many things just prior to coming to service there that I felt like I ah but the Lord knows everything and I love all of you guys and thank you for coming Michael McGarry just texted me and said brother Ron sorry we couldn't make it I love it it's not I don't demand you guys to tell me if you're not going to be in church but it's just a courtesy and Mike is so good at that and he said I think the road's closed and they said we're going to stay in Prescott tonight and I just received something from somebody while here at the pulpit um uh let's see here Benjamin Lau he said the car won't start brother so we'll see you Sunday he just sent that to him Amen brother Mark

chapter 3 will read verses 12 through 15. thank you musicians Colossians chapter 3 verses 12 through 15 we greet you all this evening in the lovely name of Jesus Christ and it's always good to be gathered together in his presence amen the Bible says in verse 12 put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness long-suffering notice he's talking to somebody right now forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgive you so also do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also year called in one body and be ye thankful amen second Timothy chapter 3 we'll read verses one through five notice there he was speaking to the elect of God the holy and beloved and he goes through all these things then he says be thankful amen second Timothy 3 1-5 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for man shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away amen you may be seated this evening in the presence of the Lord it struck me quite well when I read you know in perilous times and perilous times shall come and I can say behold we are in the midst of perilous times but in the amongst of these uh evil doers if you want to put it like that the Bible says that they're unthankful so we see here that God is is distinguishing a difference between being thankful and being unthankful that the elect of God the holy and the Beloved of the Lord the he's telling them to be thankful because the people on the opposite end of the spectrum are unthankful now let me ask you a question tonight are you thankful or are you unthankful I'd like to title my sermon this evening true worship part 10 and uh with the subject of an attitude of gratitude and this is part two now in our opening scripture we can see the expectations out of the word of God that of what God is wanting out of us as the Bride of Jesus Christ as the elect of God and how we are to live our lives uh it's sad for us to to be long-suffering and to be gentle and and all these different things to have charity amongst each other to forgive one another and this isn't just uh some kind of uh I hope for you to be like this uh no it's a commandment of God that if you call yourself the elect of God predestinated before the foundations of the world he's laying out a a blueprint here and how he wants us to live our lives as believers and so we find out that this life that we are called to live is a supernatural life this scripture and other scriptures like this that is speaking to the bride of Christ it can only be lived through a supernatural Life by a supernatural experience by the word birth amen outside of the word birth outside of a supernatural experience with God himself there is no way in this lifetime that we could ever live to the standard of the scriptures but by a new birth experience by the baptism of the Holy Ghost guess what we are more than Overcomers why because now the life of God Lives within the believer and it's no longer I the carnal man that lived but it's Christ who's living through me what is it it's the anointed word that's cool so we find in comparison here the life of the unbeliever and what it would look like in these end times what is it that makes these that makes these end times so perilous behold perilous times shall come so what is it in this end time that we're living in that makes it so perilous and so dangerous in this world that we are in it's the life of the unbeliever notice that because it said for men uh shall be lovers of their own selves they'll be Covetous boasters proud they'll be blasphemers this is all part of the perilous times that is to come in this end time and let me say this it's not coming in the end time it's already here we are living in the midst of the most perilous evil time that has ever been on the face of the planet why is it because there's men of that have never been regenerated who have never had an experience with God are just living their lives and they're proud and they're boasters and they're men Slayers they're adulterers they're fornicators whatever it may be that's what's causing the perilous times to come in in where we're living right now so the scripture when it was once written was a prophecy behold perilous times shall come at the end time let me say that this day this scripture is being fulfilled right in the midst of loudius ear right amongst us and where we're living at right now perilous times is not coming but perilous times is here but thank God in the midst of perilous times that we have an advocate before the father that we have somebody that we can turn to a protector someone to watch over us an ear that we can vent our issues to because his arm is not too short Hallelujah nor is he a deaf God but he hears the cries of his people we are living in the days as it was in the days of Noah were the conditions of man's heart was continuously evil we are living in the midst of Sodom and Gomorrah where the man burned within themselves for one another and not only that but they were proud and they weren't ashamed about it notice when the two angels went into lot's house to bring him out of Sodom and the man of the city that surrounded the house it wasn't just one man in secret but the whole city the man of the city and camped around about the house let us in let us in we're the men that came into your house this evening and here he was he was a lot he says I uh do the man no harm here's my daughters they've known no man and and here take my daughters instead but they weren't ashamed of the way that they were living their lives we don't want the women but this is what we want why did they want it because their hearts was turned over that they would believe a lie so not only this is not only were they of that way of thinking but they were proud of it and they were not ashamed of it put yourself look at the world around us I went there the other day and uh uh we we got a puppy for the kids for Christmas and uh so I went to Denver and got the little puppy or whatever and was coming back and a long day okay and uh I don't know about any of you guys have you ever driven in Colorado at about 5 30 in the snow and it's getting foggy and you know what I did my my cell phone kept taking me off the freeway and I knew I'm like if I just stay on the freeway I'll get back into Denver but I wanted to stay with my GPS so I stayed with the GPS and it's taken me all these back roads I'm thinking and Ashland calls me because you have that track my iPhone I can't do anything I can't go anywhere I can't spend any money Ashland knows it all laughs and so she's like where in the world are you I said I don't know she goes you're in the middle of nowhere I know you talk about a young man praying sincerely for the fog to lift so anyways we made it back praise the Lord and now I'm getting as I'm going somewhere with this and so we get off the plane and um have any of you ever traveled with a puppy and and and if you ever a puppy outside of a little baby is the only thing that I've ever heard a grown man go oh what a cute puppy so anyways get off the plane and uh you know how there's always people waiting it's like two in the morning there's people waiting and um you know they're all happy and everything and and their their friends are coming out and they're there to meet them and greet them well there was there was two people of the city of Sodom and Gomorrah you understand what I'm saying and so here they were and they were so happy to see each other and here they were and I looked and I'll say it as as brother Branham would said they were slopping and they were kissing and making all kinds of noise in the middle of the airport and I look and I think my is it can't be and I look again and sure enough two people of Sodom and Gomorrah to Men of the city and it was absolutely gut-wrenching it made me sick what was even sicker was there was another lady that was waiting for a friend of hers to get off the plane and she was there and she was watching and she goes oh and I could tell that she was happy that these two had reunited and she was happy to see how happy they were to see each other it used to be that whenever two people of the same sex liked each other they were ashamed there's no way two men and two women would hold hands walking down the street why because there was some kind of conviction in the air there was some kind of uh of Shame and Society even five six years ago where it wasn't accepted but now look at where we're at now it's being pushed onto our children now it's being pushed into the schools so that everybody can accept that that is just normal it's not normal it's disgusting in the eyes of God not only are they gay but they're proud they want to rub it in your face and let everybody know because there's no shame about it anymore I say Lord Jesus come quickly there's a little boy that goes to my daughter's school and this little boy all of a sudden now wants to be a little girl so what this little boy does when he's 10 years old we see it in the headlines we see it in the News transgender and we see all these different things but when it comes down to where you're living at it's a different story and this little boy's dressing like a little girl little mini skirt letting his hair grow out so now as a father watch this as a father now and my children Mariah is the oldest she's eight years old and miles is in kindergarten he's six now we're having to explain to our little children our little innocent children why it's not okay for those things to be why it's not okay for the for for a kid to have a daddy and a daddy and a mommy and a mommy these are conversations that we're having to have with our children I'm not talking about teenagers little kids now watch this if we are not wise and how we raise our kids if we are not wise and we're looking out for these things and teaching our children the ways of God and why it's wrong they're going to think it's okay so we gotta stand for truth we got to stand for what's right Hallelujah amen it's not easy but it has to be done right and so I think and I look out and I we got a bunch a bunch of little boys and everything like that and and stuff and you know and this is just me and you take it this is my opinion but it's like I don't believe we should be raising our children little boys it's okay to play with a little dolly it's okay to act like a girl oh it's funny who it's okay to do these things it's funny ha ha no it's not funny how many of us are going to play with these kinds of spirits I want my boys to be rough and tumble again get them boys we gotta be careful because if we don't watch these things within our children a lot of you have raised your children and stuff like that and that's okay if you believe what I'm saying you can say Amen things you have to watch out for when the girl is the firstborn you gotta watch for the boys because they're going to want to do what big sis does the boy is the firstborn the girl's going to want to be a tomboy because she's always rough and Tumbling With the bigger brother God give us wisdom as mothers and fathers to watch out over our children from a young age to say you know what son I'm one of my boys yet the other day and this is what struck me about it he told me he goes Dad I'm a girl I said you ain't no girl you're a boy and you're all boy no he was just messing around he was being funny but he realized that it wasn't funny because if we play with these things the spirits in this end time are no respecter of persons tell them what they are yeah amen God help us huh amen yeah it used to be that it was a shameful thing but now there's no shame in the world may we not be ashamed of this gospel that when we have an opportunity to present truth to somebody that we're not a backboneless wishy-washy person but we can tell the truth and love to the person that's wanting to hear it the anointed ones at the end time 1965 brother Brown says underline that last days that's when it's going to happen perilous time shall come we are in it for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful that's amazing and Unholy look at this Bunch that we got today they're rotten even in man out on the street young men pulling their hair down over their forehead like with bangs like a woman it's perversion so what you're trying to tell me is the prophet is saying that a way that a young man will cut his hair after his bangs and it's all curled up over his eyebrows it's a perversion absolutely today we're living in you ever see these guys it's all long and curly and and they you know these guys it acts as a good sun visor what is it it's a perversion sodomites did you read in this year this month in Reader's Digest the American people at the age between I think it was 20 and 25 years old is already in their middle age condition they're finished they're rotten science says that that a man is in his middle age and a woman when they're in their early 20s their body is so rotten and given over to filth oh America how off God would have hovered over you but now your hour is come you lead the world in filth this day these scriptures are being fulfilled before our very eyes there are people who are fulfilling the very prophecy of unrighteousness and a body of flesh but there's also a people who is fulfilling the scripture for this day and for this hour of people of righteousness of people of Holiness of people who stands on truth of people who love truth of people who loves the word of God and they are the word that's being made flesh the very fulfillment of the scriptures thank you Lord Philippians 4 verse 6 be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God so in other words when you're bringing your requests before God thank him for the request before it has even come to pass that's faith Colossians 3 15 and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which you're you're called in one body and be thankful Colossians 4 2 continue in prayer and watching the same with Thanksgiving Thanksgiving and prayer go hand in hand Hallelujah the scripture does not say if things are going good if you've received good gifts if you're in good health and everything's okay to be thankful but in every situation no matter if it's good if it's bad if it's ugly if you've never been there before to be thankful unto God because this is his requirements for the elect of God now we'll notice that thankfulness is directly correlated with our attitude have you ever tried to be thankful with a bad attitude it doesn't happen so being thankful is directly correlated with our attitudes and our attitudes is directly correlated with the promises of God because brother Branham said the right mental attitude towards what any promise of God will bring it to pass so an unthankful person cannot bring the word of God to pass in their lives so that's why he's saying be ye thankful because when you're thankful your attitude is good and when your attitude is good your faith is high and when your faith is high all the promises of God is for us to believe in and to come to pass Hallelujah so our faith towards the promises of God is what determines whether it'll come to pass or not but that depends on our attitude and that depends on whether we're thankful or not without money or without price 1959 brother Branham said sure they were thankful they were grateful and any man or woman that's born of the spirit of God and receives the Holy Ghost will always be thankful and the holy ghost-filled church said no matter whatever happens you'll be grateful Hallelujah huh it's easy to say when things are going good but when it's not going so good that's when the anchor holds yes sir now brother Branham Associates thankfulness and the healing of the body together many many times notice this the brass serpent 1953 brother Branham says you want to get over the female trouble and the arthritis and things and that just go on off the platform thanking God for it that's all you have to do be thankful he's done it I he didn't even pray for the lady he just do you want to be you want to be healed of these things well sure I do that's why I'm here just be thankful why should I be thankful he said because he's done it it's already done it's already finished the work is already complete we just got to be thankful for it listen to this whatever he says to you do it 1953 oh father is this poor little uh old hand lays over here and mine know that maybe it stroked back to tears from a many crying baby's eyes uh rock the cradle maybe in a younger day the little baby would get hurt and come mother and you'd kiss away the tears and rock them away and it'll be all right but God it'll take your hand to wipe the tear tonight and to rock away the things but thou can do it Lord I pray that you'll Grant it may she be healed tonight now I lay hands upon her in Jesus name for her healing amen God bless you Sister go happy and rejoicing be thankful to God and you'll get well let's say thanks be to God so what is his what what is what is what is he telling her to do he's not telling her to go fast for 40 days he's not telling her to go and do some magnificent thing but he's saying go home tonight and be thankful and you will get well my the Queen of Sheba 1960 for your baby many suffer from the same disease do you believe it's it's little heart will get well and it'll be all right do you believe father God the baby's too little to have faith may it be well in Jesus Christ's name amen don't doubt the baby will live go home and be thankful to God now my these are just three examples of many many times where brother Branham after he has prayed for somebody or he's counseling for somebody in the prayer line he's saying you're going to be well it's already done just go now go rejoicing and be thankful for what God has already done brother Branham was trying to show the people that no matter what lays before them if they would just be thankful to God and the work that he has already accomplished that he will bring the promises to pass in their lives yes president Brown told us time and time again he said the work is finished it's already done it's already complete he would go as far to say if Jesus was here in a human body actually Jesus with a suit on he couldn't do anything more for you than what he has already done so brother Branham was trying to get her eyes onto the finished work and be thankful for what has already been completed Hallelujah all we have to do is accept it be thankful for it and then be patient for the promise to come to pass he hear the word it hasn't affect you you store it in your heart but a lot of times it doesn't come to pass right away and that's okay be patient and the promise will come to pass Hebrews 6 verse 15 and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise some of you right now you are patiently enduring and let me let me just admonish you and let me say continue to be patient in your enduring because the time will come when that seed will take Life The Promise will come to pass you know the Bible tells us to walk by faith and not by sight you know brother Branham got to a stage in his ministry where he was always looking for a vision he was I forget what sermon it is but he said yeah I would go and the people would come before me and they say brother Branham ah I just want to get well will I get will and and brother Brown would go and said well let me go into the back room let me go somewhere different and wait on a vision he was depending upon the gift that God had placed in his life because the gift never failed him and the Holy Spirit spoke to his heart and convicted him and said you don't have to wait for a vision because it's by faith and the promised word of God that brings the word to pass it's not the vision the vision is what would give the people the confidence and the faith but if we could have faith in the word hallelujah without a vision without somebody telling us anything that's real faith Hallelujah now before we can have faith to receive healing for God from God we must get rid of all uncertainty in our lives we must get get rid of all of the uncertainty concerning the will of God have any of you ever said well if it be God's will I'll get well if it's God's will if it's God's will I know I can do this and yeah but but if it's not God's will I guess it won't happen if it's not God's will I guess I'll never be delivered if it's not God's will I guess I'll always have to live with this if it's not if it's not if it's not we're so worried about something being God's will that it hinders our very faith so if you want to know the will of God for a situation in your life go to the word because the word has the answer now the question is is it God's will to be healed in our natural bodies I know it's a minor but it's still a part of God's word I know it's a minor and I know that the healing of of the soul is far greater if we never see a healing in our bodies but yet the healing of the body is still part of the word so what do we do we go to God's word because we want to see what the will of God is for this certain subject or this certain area in our lives now when you go through the word what I want you guys to do tonight or tomorrow whenever you get some time go to your Bible go to your Concordance everybody's got a concordance look up heal or healed or healing wherever those words occur and look up the scriptures and see for yourself what the word says because when you know the will of God for a certain situation an area in your life nobody can take you out of it it takes away all the uncertainty it takes away all the doubt because now you're standing upon the promised word you're not standing upon your intellects well I don't know if it's God's will or not all that is is a seed of Discord in your life it's a weed how can we expect to grow corn in our lives and to reap a harvest of corn when we're sowing weeds into our hearts well it worked for this other person but I don't know about you that's a lie Hallelujah so what we want to do there's a few things that that we must do first don't we understand that the word of God is a seed so what we want to do we want to plant the will of God which is his word and we want to plant it into our hearts because if we plant the word into our hearts the word will harvest in its due time now there's a few things that we must do also as Believers we must hide the word of God in our hearts because when the word is hidden within our hearts no man can take it from us we need to be as the Lord told Joshua and we need to meditate on these things day and night why do we have to meditate on them day and night because we are saturating our whole being with the word of God and when we saturate our lives with the word of God the word of God will bring the past the word of God that's so simple but yet we need to apply it so we hear the word we seek it out diligently diligently okay here's here's I'll just talk on healing for instance here's this healing I I have this infirmity and I need rid of it and and and I just want it to be the will of God it is the will of God that we would be healed so we take the word now we search the scriptures and we put our concordance together we write it down after we write it down we hide it in our hearts after we hide it in our hearts we meditate on those things day in and day out because when we're meditating and we're saturating ourselves in the word of God it keeps the world out of our lives it keeps doubt out of our Lives it keeps those things that would hinder us from Walking with God how we should by faith out of our Lives why because doubt and faith will not mix together and when we're flooding ourselves by Faith by positivity of God's word so when we saturate our lives with the promises that's written within this word we will no longer be affected by the temporal things by our situations and the things that are around to say guess what yeah they're there yeah it's a burden to our tour to our carnal man but our spiritual man is not affected why because we're walking by faith take your eyes off the temporal and put them on the eternal so if God has given us a promise he will bring that promise to pass in our lives when it is met with the right attitude hey man as the musicians will come we'll bring this to a close so now I looked up a few scriptures concerning healing within the body because what do I want to do I want to impart something into your mind and into your heart which is the word of God and when you take the word of God and it is imparted Into the Heart of a person guess what happens that word of God now will begin to grow something you'll begin to take place perhaps attitudes will begin to change why because how can you have a bad attitude when you're surrounding yourself with promised scriptures that are eternal and as our attitude begins to get better we begin now to be thankful within our hearts father thank you for what you're doing in my life thank you for bringing the promise to pass even before it has physically come to pass Mark 9 verse 23 Jesus said unto him if thou cast believe all things are possible to him that believeth Isaiah 53 verse 5 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed what kind of scripture is that that is the scripture that we need to impart into our hearts that for my transgressions guess what he was wounded and for mine iniquities and the things that I've done wrong and the things that I will ever do wrong guess what he was bruised for those inequities I say thank you Lord the chastisement of our peace my peace your peace guess what it was all placed upon him with his stripes we are healed that's a scripture let it go down into your heart first Peter 2 24 who his own self bear our sins and his own body and on the tree that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousness by whose Stripes he were healed acts 10 38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power he went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him Matthew 8 16-17 when the even was come they brought on to him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the Spirits by laying hands and anointing and with this word and healed all that were sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and he bear our sicknesses Matthew chapter 10 8 7-8 and as you go preached saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out Devils freely you've received freely give Hebrews 13 and 8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever as we read these scriptures of of healing and and deliverances and all these different things that these people of old uh uh witnessed and and we're part of we think well that was just in days gone by but I love it the theme scripture of this message Hebrews 13 and 8. that Jesus Christ is not just Jesus Christ of the old but he is the same today he will be the same tomorrow and he will be the same forever because he changes not therefore if he was the same Jesus the things that he did when he walked the shores of Galilee guess what he's the same Jesus tonight and because he is the same and he changes not guess what he is able to perform the same Miracles he is able to do the same things the same Miracles and the same deliverances can happen right amongst us why because Jesus is amongst us thank you sir but he wants us to do one thing first he wants us to be thankful so now if we would just take a uh a dialogue I guess of our lives and go well I wonder how my attitude has been I wonder have I been so grateful have I been have I been thankful uh how has my attitude been towards the promises of God of have I been all negativity and and looking at my circumstances or have you been standing upon the promises of God by faith if you've been standing let me encourage you keep standing and when you keep standing keep on standing and keep standing until that promise has come to pass because from a thanks God will not reject a thankful heart God will not reject a thankful attitude how can he young boys you want to get more from your parents be thankful foreign you want a new soccer ball a real real real thankful for the last things that you got show a lot of appreciation and then when it comes huh when it comes to the time
