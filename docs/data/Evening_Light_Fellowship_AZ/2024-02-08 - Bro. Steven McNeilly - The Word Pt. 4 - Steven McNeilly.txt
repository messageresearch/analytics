be in the house of the Lord thank you musicians uh if you have your Bibles turn with me to the Book of Revelation chap 20 and we'll read verses 11 through 15 we just want to welcome you all into the house of the Lord and I appreciate the opportunity to minister here this evening and we'd like to uh say a big greetings to dibl here him and his wife are are back from their honeymoon there and everything from getting married let's give them a round of applause yeah welcome home praise the Lord Revelation chap 20 and verse 11 and it says and I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works somebody say books books there's two different books that we're seeing here amen there's the books and then there's another book it's very important for us to know what these books are and what are contained within these books and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and everybody said amen praise the Lord and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire amen John 1 ver14 John 1 and verse1 14 and it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated I would like to continue on this evening with this thought uh and I'd like to title it the word and this is part four and we've been speaking on the word of God and how that the the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we realized that there was a reason for the word to become flesh and it was not only for God to redeem man and to bring him back into his original position and having fellowship with God just like man had in the Garden of Eden yet that is a part of it but another part of the reason why he be became flesh was that we the flesh might become the word which is Christ so the word became flesh was materialized amongst us so that the flesh now might become the word it's just like that song that we sing uh he became me so that I might become him by grace and so we all are of a great understanding that if it wasn't for the grace of almighty God there's absolutely no way that we could make it there's no way that we could become the word there's no way for us to get to heaven but by Grace amen that's what I'm depending upon this evening is the grace of God Amen and so we see then that this great Plan of Redemption that God has had in his mind since the foundations of the world has been unfolding and unfolding for for times and times we see since the Fall In the Garden of Eden and God is wanting to restore us back to what we originally had with him with Fellowship one with another because that's the great Chasm that came between God and man When sin entered the picture the fellowship was never the same as it was before there was a Chasm there was a a a a a canyon there was there was a hole in the ground there was something that was there that was preventing the fellowship that God desires to have with man amen and so we know that Jesus Christ came and he came to redeem those that were flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone he became he he came to redeem those that were a part of him from the beginning he didn't come to redeem the whole earth he didn't come to redeem all those of mankind but only those who were predestinated to receive it prise the Lord that's why brother bradam said if you were never in his mind in the beginning you will never be there in the end but if you were in his mind in the beginning there's nothing that can prevent us there's nothing that can stop us or hindering us from entering into the joys of the Lord hallelujah now because mankind fail the Flesh in order for man to be redeemed from his flesh understand you don't have to be delivered from your wife you don't have to be delivered from your husband or your kids or the neighbors or even the neighbor's dog you've got to be delivered from your own flesh because your own flesh man is the one who gives you the most trouble on a daily basis good the biggest problem that we have in our homes is our flesh man our home is made for a a a sanctuary our home is supposed to be a a Haven a safe place a a place where we can get away from the things of the world and and and have our little family uh in a Sanctified safe Zone but too much of the time we get carnal too much of the time we get caught up in our flesh in the place where we're supposed to be a a sanctuary and a Haven all of a sudden we're walking in flesh and because of our flesh man there's troubles in the home there's troubles in marriages there's troubles with the kids why because we're in the flesh God help us to take inventory of Our Lives father let me realize and recognize when I'm In the Flesh because I know when I'm in the flesh there's trouble ahead let me be in the spirit not just when I'm in church not just on a Wednesday or Sunday but 24 hours in a day seven days a week father let me be in the spirit in order for you to be in the spirit though you've got to do something you've got to yield yourself to the presence of God cuz if you don't yield yourself to God God can't work in our lives God help us praise God so we realize that God took upon himself a robe of Flesh to redeem us from this Fallen State y that we find ourselves born in amen if I would have had the choice I would have said father I don't want to be born in a fallen State let me be born in a perfect State and I'll live perfectly for you but God had another plan so we realize that all of our sins our failures our shortcomings the things that hinder us now the things that prevent us from entering into the presence of God has already been taken care of at the cross of Calvary by Jesus Christ Our Lord thank you Lord thank you Lord all of your shortcomings all of your failures yeah all of your faults guess what it's already taken care of God has already taken care of it and he's already made away Amen Hallelujah Jesus so because man fail in the flesh God had to come and redeem Man In the Flesh God could not redeem mankind as a spirit because a spirit is not kin's folk a spirit is not uh uh close to uh the human flesh the spirit of man did not fall it was the flesh man so in order now for God to to operate and become a kinsman redeemer he had to become flesh what does it mean to be kins folk what does it mean to be a kinsman redeemer it means to be close in relation it means to be blood relation oh that's my kin FK if you were to see some of my cousins in Ireland you would say that's brother Steven's kin folk well how would you know because they kind of look like me we have the same kind of attributes we have the same kind of characteristics whether we like to believe it and accept it or not I don't look like him yeah you do my uncle ah I have an uncle and and uh and and he's short and he's kind of heavy way shorter than me and way heavier than me and uh they call him fat Eddie right I'm like him my uncle Denver man you look at the two of us you think he's my dad and I look at him and I say no way Lord when I look in the mirror I'm look completely different but we have the same nose we have the same facial features I think my goodness why cuz we're kin folk we're of the same blood it's like my boys I went and did my taxes the other day and I was it's kind of funny the last you know six plus years whatever it is that I've been doing my taxes at this place I've always had a kid the next year almost so he told me no more kids no no more kids so I showed him a picture of my family you know how how was proud dads like to do with their kids and uh he looks at that and he goes oh yeah there's no denying those boys are yours why because we're kin folk we're blood related and so God now had to become Kinsmen he had to become flesh so that he be so that he could redeem us in the flesh praise the Lord now we realize that the Book of Ruth was a shadow of the complete Plan of Redemption of God how that God would become kin folk to us how that uh how that he hungered sometimes other times he cried he knew what it was like to to to to be tempted in the wilderness for 40 days he knew what it was like to to cry at the grave of Lazareth he knew what it was like to suffer as a human being he knew what it was like to have good friends in his life but he also knew what it was like to have those friends betray him in the darkest hour of his life he suffered within the gate he suffered In the Flesh why because he wanted to be a good high priest that could be touched by the feelings of our infirmities I want you to know that God understands where you're at in your life why because he's B there he's suffered through those things he's had the same thoughts but if he overcame those things we can also overcome them as well he went through all these things he was tempted in every manner yet as the scripture says he was without sin now we realize that when Boaz paid the price for Naomi's plot of land when he redeemed Naomi he got Ruth true amen he played the part of a kinsman redeemer there was another man that was closer kin to Naomi than Boaz was and so he had a meeting with him and he said hey are you willing to make uh are you willing to to to do this and to redeem Naomi and Ruth and he said I am able to do it but I'm not going to do it who was the our nearest to Kin before we came to Christ it's our carnal man it was Satan through our natural birth but Satan can't redeem us from nothing he just gets us into trouble but here was Boaz he says he says if you're not willing to do it I am able and I am willing to do this perform this work of redemption because I am kins folk to Naomi and he takes off his shoe Footprints are possession and he slams his shoe and he says I'm going to pay the price for Naomi but Ruth Hallelujah will be my bride so when Jesus Christ came his he came to his own and his own received him not he said I am come but to the lost sheep of Israel that's right he redeemed Israel right but he got himself a gentile bride what is it it's a perfect type showing us that the price has been paid that ought to make us happy tonight to know that the price has been paid in full that we have the earnest of our inheritance already within us hallelujah Ruth 4: 9 and 10 look at this and Bo said unto the elders unto all the people you're Witnesses this day that I have bought all that was aimex and all that was Chileans and malons of the hand of Naomi moreover Ruth the Moes the wife of Malon have I purchased to be my wife what did Christ purchase you with yes he did wasn't just something that was free he didn't just take you for nothing no he paid the ultimate price for without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins so he paid the ultimate price my friend for you and I Lord thank God to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his Brethren and from the Gate of his place ye are witnesses today so when Jesus Paid the ultimate price his own blood it it it it it it bought us those who were predestinated to life so what does he get out of it a lot of times we talk about our inheritance and oh my if we would only know our inheritance and we would put our name on The Inheritance and The Inheritance is ours what does Jesus get out of this fellow what does he get in return for the price that he paid I come across this quote today and it was just beautiful brother brandham said she is his inheritance that's right Hallelujah where does that put you and I yes sir who say we are a part of this inheritance who say that we believe the message and that we're the Bride of this last day guess what you ought to start looking at yourself a little more differently and start looking at yourself how he sees you if we see the inheritance of Heaven that it's so great and it's So Glorious and The Inheritance that written within this book and it makes us feel so overwhelmed and joyful how does it make God feel when he looks at you when he sees that the glory of the man is the woman if God could have gave him anything greater he would have done it that's right but he give him you and I oh what an inheritance and this is an inheritance that he is excited about Hallelujah he can't wait to come and take you home he can't wait for that hour when the clouds will part he can't wait for that hour of the rapturing of his bride why because as long as you've been waiting he's been waiting longer he is waiting for you to come into your position in Christ he is waiting for you to catch the vision to catch the understanding of the word that's what he's waiting for I say father wait no longer give it to me give me the Revelation Lord to get us out of here yes Lord because once the true church realizes who she [Applause] is and why she's here she'll be an invincible Army Hallelujah she'll be an army not an army that that can't be seen she'll be an army that stands temptation she'll be an army that overcomes Temptation she'll be an overcomer in this day While others are undergoing why because she cannot be conquered Hallelujah she is his inheritance to breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals he said notice here he come leaves the throne as an intercessor as a slain lamb to become a lion king to bring the whole world into judgment that's rejected what have they rejected they've rejected the word for their day you see the importance of recognizing your word and its message for the day and hour in which you live amen our kinsman redeemer then is King overall why he's got the title deed of Redemption where does he have it he has it in that little book who is that title deed of redemption who is it that's written within that book Brother Paul's the only one raising his hand I'm going to raise my hand because I'm foolish enough to believe that I am a part of it I am foolish enough to believe that my name is written within that book why because God has begin something in my life that I have no control over once I lived a life of sin that I had no control over but when Jesus came in Hallelujah something has been happening I've been transformed by the renewing of my mind not by trying to do it myself but letting God do it don't try to do it yourself you're going to fail let God do it let God do the work don't try to overcome well I'm going to try no let God do [Applause] iten the moment that we try to bring our Humanity into it we're going to fail every single time but if would just take a backseat and let pilate Jesus take a hold of our ship and say father I'm done trying to steer this thing I'm done trying to get this thing out of the rocks and everything Lord take control thank you Lord it all Lays in his hand he says I'm glad I know him see then claims his inheritance that that's the church the bride he claims it amen he comes to claim those who are his those who are written in the palm of his hand what does he come for he comes to claim them why because he wants his inheritance he wants what belongs to him amen and when he comes he's going to take it right and there ain't nothing that's going to stop him from taking it not even your own self can stop him from taking it thank you Lord hallelujah Daniel chapter 7: 9 and 10 staying with this thought of the white Throne judgment and these books and what are these books mean and stuff verse 9 it says I beheld till the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool what did Brother brandham say it represents now it's changed it is the wig now he's he's the judge of all the Earth he's no longer a lamb but now he has his ministry has changed from a lion from a lamb now to a lion the the the ministry the dispensation of Grace is now over amen and it's no longer Grace but it's judgment with the white uh the white wool of the wig of judgment upon his head amen he is King judge that's right there ain't no president put him in it either there ain't no president that can take him out of being King judge why because it's [Applause] God you know we thought whenever whenever Trump put all these different judg judges in and stuff and and and and everything ah it's going to change everything that don't change Squad times are going to get worse and going to get worse it don't matter who we have in office it don't matter what kind of Judges that we have it's all a bunch of corruption why because Satan is the head of it all that's why I'm trusting in only one and one and only and that's God amen amen hallelujah amen it said his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheel as burning fire a fiery stream issued and uh and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered onto him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were opened so there's thousands times thousands ministered onto him it's a group of people and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him notice one is ministering and one is standing before him it's two groups of people amen we pick it back up again Revelation 20 and verse 12 and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was opened which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the book according to their works so now we see uh continuity between these scriptures though one was written by Daniel in the Old Testament and the other one here by John the Revelator in the New Testament but this Vision or these scriptures are both uh portraying the same event it's not two different events but it's the same event that both men now are giving by inspiration and revelation of God of a future event that is to take place it is prophecy amen and so we see then that there's like I've already said there is the thousands times thousands that are ministering onto him there's the 10,000 times 10 thousands of people that are standing before him and they're all doing something right they are all there for a purpose they're there for a reason and they are in their certain positions of where they are ministering and standing before God for a purpose amen we see that uh there was both groups that were there and that the books were opened now what is the significance in these books and what do they mean what are the significance of these groups of people and what does it mean who are these people where did these people come from what is the scene that is set before us what is happening in this I don't know about you but when I read it I can Envision it in my mind I can see something that's going on I see I see God sitting upon a throne and his white wig is on and and I see this fire and and thousands times thousands are are ministering on to him somehow but there's other people that are standing before him who are going to be judged by the books amen you see these books are very important because the Judgment comes from the books right I got quotes for you it's okay that's why I love amen the message of the hour amen it makes things so plain before us that a blind man that a foolish person that's unlearned such as myself can understand it why is it because it's the Holy Spirit that's given the interpretation it's the Holy Spirit that's given the revelation of what is written because you could read it and not understand it you can read what a prophet has said and still have no idea what he's talking about but the same Holy Ghost gave the inspiration to brother brandom if that's the same holy ghost in our lives we're going to catch it why because the word receives and recognizes the word hallelujah okay so we understand that in in Daniel chap 7 and in Revelation 20 it is both the picture of the same event what is this event that's taking place this event that is taking place it happens after the Rapture of the church it happens after the tribulation period after the Millennium Reign then the rest of the Dead will rise in the second resurrection and this event of the great white Throne judgment takes place after the Rapture after Millennium Reign not first resurrection second Resurrection I don't want to come up and second Resurrection amen because if I come up in second Resurrection guess what I've missed it and I'm going to be judged according to the book father let me take my judgment now that's why we're at church this evening because judgment begins at the house of God and so just for the simple fact that you're here this evening Hallelujah though it was hard to get here no no doubt you had some of you had a hard day some of you had a hard time with family this that no doubt some of you have many excuses not to come to church tonight but yet you're saying Father Judge Me am judge me because I'm going to church to be judged not to get a backrub not to be told how well I'm doing but to be judged Lord because if I take my judgment now I won't be judged over there the Lord questions and answers uh 1964 brother brandham says now notice in this second Resurrection when they come up then Satan's loosed out of his prison for a little season then the judgment is set now watch Jesus with the bride now notice this and I'll I'll try to slow down because if I go to preaching it too fast guess what you just get caught up with the emotion of the preacher and oh he was very emotional and oh he was fast no this and that no but then we miss what's being said sometimes it's good for us to slow down that's right so we can enunciate so that we can take time and point things out of what's being said Jesus with the bride he doesn't say with the church amen with the bride as king and queen sat at the throne white Throne judgment and the books were opened so now he's going to tell us cuz the Bible says the books were opened then another book was opened so what books is these that are opened he said the book of the Sinners so now by prophetic insight and by prophetic understanding now we can look at Revelations 20 and Daniel 7: 8 and N whatever it was and we can say these books that were opened it was the book of The Sinner and from this book now these Sinners that come before the white Throne judgment are going to be judged according to their own works that's what the scripture says amen that's right so one of these groups is standing before him notice they're not ministering onto him they're standing before him it's 10,000s times 10,000s who are these people to put it very bluntly they're Sinners they are people that live their lives however way they wanted to live it they are people that gave their lives over to Satan whether they knew it or not they lied they stole they cheated they abused they raped they did whatever it was that they could to get ahead in life why because they were Sinners because they were born that way and they never had a nature change they never had a born again experience with God therefore uh they were never saved amen they were never his and so this is where they come up at the white Throne judgment and we realize that every person that is born in this Earth every single person we are all born the same way we've all been conceived the same way there's only one that was conceived by the spoken word and that was Jesus Christ Naturally Speaking I want to say that the Bride of Jesus Christ her Born Again experience is by the spoken word of God yes cuz we are birthed the Bible says by the word of God Adam and Eve never brought forth the promise where God told him to replenish and multiply the Earth it wasn't supposed to come through a a an act between a man and a woman but it was supposed to come by the spoken word of God she was unable to fulfill it because she had wrong desires but I'll say this from Ephesus to laiaa the scripture of Genesis to go forth and multiply by a spoken word has been coming to pass since Ephesus to louia spoken word children of God hallelujah so in the time that we were born in this life God has a book for every one of us and this is the book that stays with our Natural Life so every time that we sin from the age of 12 onwards I don't have a quote from that for that but brother brandham says from the age of 12 upwards is the age of accountability so anything before the age of accountability guess what is not held against us why because we don't know any better God can't hold us accountable for something as an immature little child that we don't know anything better about but when we get to the age of accountability now God begins to journal does any of you Journal it's good to journal I tried to journal once a month ah soon as you turn 12 years old wow wow you were told to clean up your room by your parents 12 years old you ever been told to clean up your room by your parents 12 years old oh it's clean mom it's clean [Applause] dad lie wow I'm going to write this down Stephen did not clean his room but he said he did so what does that make stevenh a liar let's continue as Stephen became an adolescent he gave his mom and dad an attitude that he never should have done he told his mom it's none of her business where he's been all night he told his dad get off of my back and guess what he took upon himself at the age of 14 a good rebellious Spirit you ever heard of a good rebellious Spirit oh yeah that's one that's really bad oh I had one and little did I know in my spiritual I guess it's as the as the Rebellion is as the sin thank you of Witchcraft wow amen Steven's life started getting real heavy real quick why CU Not only was he rebellious Not only was he disrespectful Not only was he a liar not only was he all these things in his carnal man but now he's taken part in Witchcraft and he doesn't even know it why because he's rebellious he won't mind his mom and dad he won't mind the teachers at school he don't care and he's doing what he wants when he wants and how he wants to do it why because he is a sinner I didn't ask for it what about you we could continue on and go through our 20s go through your 30s whatever it is however old you are or it was until you accepted Christ into your life every Idol thought that's right Every Idle Word every wrong thing that came through your mind every lie that we ever spoke every time we took advantage of somebody whatever it might have been God was journaling it yeah and it was written down within a book and now he's doing it for a purpose because he know there's going to come a time where there's a great white Throne judgment and he's not going to uh he's just going to read before us the book hi Stephen you did this back then no I didn't you can't hide that because here it is it's all written in my journal amen that you didn't even know I was taking and I have every downfall every Pitfall every wrong thing that you have ever done by yielding yourself to Satan and it's all right here and these things are contrary to my word and I see within this journal right up until the time of your death you never accepted Christ into your life there was never a change your name stayed within this book it was never transferred to another book here it is I have a place that's prepared for you that's what God is doing right whether people want to believe it or not God is journaling of the life of every individual that was born since Canan Abel until the last ones he's journaling I want to ask you if we were to read our Journal right what what would our Journal say right if there was no blood to cover it if there was no sacrifice for sin what would our Journal be saying about us there is not a one of us could stand in the presence of God my there will be no hiding there there will be no saying that wasn't me there will be no saying I didn't think those thoughts because it'll be replayed right back to that individual there will be no hiding and there will be no getting away from it God have mercy amen hallelujah so we realize that we have this I could call it a book of remembrance I suppose and it is a book that is written after our our carnal life our natural life and because it is written according to our natural man guess what the things of of this Earth is very natural for us to to to uh to go towards it is very natural for us to want to do the things of the Earth the things of the world and and lie and steal and do all these different things why because we are naturally carnal Sinners amen right now we realize then that we were all born this way at one point in our lives guess what we were all a bunch of Sinners not just brother stepen but you guess what you're a bunch of dirty Sinners whether you were born and raised in church or not or whether you were born in this in the in the downtown streets of of Phoenix and vanur and the roughest street that you can find guess what it doesn't matter if you're raised in church or raised in the streets of Belfast or wherever it might be guess what we are all sinners am that's why we are in need of a savior and so now one day this kinsman redeemer guess what he come by your way whether you're in the streets of Phoenix Arizona or whatever streets it was you were running in whether it was in a church service God had an appointed time with you and you had an appointed time with Destiny a time when your life would change forever and God touched your heart and he said let us come and reason together though your sins be red like Scarlet as Isaiah said they shall be white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be white as wool and God had a a not a contest with you but he had a conference God had a conference with you and he said let's reason together this life that you're living extending you to one place but if you would just come on to me if you would give me your burden I'll give you my burden because my burden is easy and my yoke is liked and something changed in your life do you remember that amise God sir amen what happened I'm not talking about making a confession there's many people that make a confession in Christianity but they never go forth to a new birth experience it goes further than confession but it goes to a supernatural birth Supernatural birth where you know that you've met God face to face that's right brother stepen how do I know how do I know that I've met him how do I know that something happened your life will bear witness amen and you'll be like Paul and you'll say those things that I that I once loved I now hate and those things that I once held to I I guess what I count them as dung and and and I'm going to forget those things because they don't interest me no more and I'm going to press forward towards the mark and the high calling in Christ Jesus I'm not going to look back I'm I'm going to move forward why because my life is changing thank you Lord if you will let God change your life God will change your life will if you let God into your situations and drop your pride God will take care of the situations hallelujah amen praise God Amen praise him so we realize that it's not just a confession onto repentance but it is a birth the word in the seed of God breaking forth and bringing life into your life amen notice this the invisible Union of the bride of Christ well you separated from your first Union what is that First Union is when we were born in this earth we were married to the carnal man we were married to Satan and we didn't even know it amen so now we are separated from our first Union by spiritual death now you are born again or remarried again to the new spiritual union of not your natural life of the things of the world but eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you that's amazing for me that's amazing cuz it lets me know that he was looking for me I wasn't out here looking for God but the word of God had found me the word of God will find you wherever it is that you're hiding whatever uh uh though you're covered in the merry clay of loud you see the word of God will find you thank you he came looking for me when I was lost in sin he came looking for me before I knew that I needed a savior right Hallelujah now your name and your old has been transferred what's he talking about the old book the book of your natural Life the book that the journal that God has been taken down from us since the age of accountability up to this point now our name is being transferred from that book to another book what does that mean it means there's hope it means that I have a chance of making it why because those things the ordinances that were once against me guess what now they're blotted out they're not against me no moreen thank you Jesus he says do you mean to tell me my old book he says God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness you stand perfectly before God now your name is now the new book not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural Union notice he's making a distinction of these two books so there's a distinction between your old man and the born again man you need to make a distinction between your old man and your born again man that's where the problem lies God can make the distinction but we have a hard time and dividing the flesh from the spiritual he says not the old book of your natural Union by your new bride Hallelujah your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate Hallelujah where your true Eternal germ from the beginning takes hold your true who you really are who you really are deep down inside it takes a hold why because he found you Hallelujah that's right now you're not only forgiven but you're Justified Glory Justified Romans 51 said yeah Romans 51 said therefore being justified by faith brother brandham said the the book of our first birth our marriage has been cast into the sea of God's forgetfulness now does that mean that God is this this little uh old grandpa that sits up in the ramp parts of heaven and he's getting so old that he forgets things say no no oh I can't remember what he did 20 years ago so I guess it never happened anyway in the first place no he can't remember because you are Justified right amen the book that was once against You Now does not exist anymore it's been taken care of God took care of it at Calvary by the washing of Blood by the shedding of his blood God took care of your old book so not only is it cast into the sea of his forgetfulness but it's absolutely destroyed God took care of it God took care of your sin therefore it is not brought to God's remembrance anymore why because it doesn't exist that's right the book is not there though Satan can come before God and say look what he's doing look what he did look what he thought look what he said look at this look what they done in their past and God said I have no idea idea what you're talking about because it doesn't exist anymore there's a bumper between the sin that he now commits it's the bumper of the blood of Jesus Christ your accusations sound good but they're not true therefore Satan you're a liar get out of my presence but now it's up to us to have that same attitude to look at ourselves of how God is looking at us and to make a distinction amen between who you really are as a germ seed of God yes amen and the flesh man right that was born in this world help us they are two very very different beings they are two very very different people and you know what I'm talking about CU you live with both of them on a daily basis amen good brother but let me encourage you this guy here it's not the real guy it is just something that is sent to hinder you to bring forth who you really arek you there's always a hindrance when the when the children of Israel when they went into the promised land guess what they didn't kill all of the um the uh uh Canaanites and all these different guys no there was some of them that was left why to prove Israel if there's one thing that is to prove the seed of God it is your flesh man there's a distinction my brother and my sister there's a distinction make the right distinction of who you really are look he said it there of who you really are as a seed gening of God and who this flesh man is that was born in carnality amen amen Colossians 2:14 and 15 and you being dead in your sins and the UN uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you some of your trespasses having forgiven a wee bit of your trespasses no when God does something he does it right having forgiven all somebody say all say it again you didn't mean it that's right all of your trespasses than blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was once against us notice these handwriting of ordinances at one time were true and they were against you but they've been blotted out how by the blood of Jesus Christ nailing it to his cross Hallelujah so those things that were once against us when Satan could come and and and and tell God hey look at this right they're blotted out he doesn't see it than he doesn't understand what say why because it doesn't exist any longer am Hallelujah that gives an old sinner boy like me from Ireland a bit of Hope really does so now we are separated from our first Union through our first Birth by spiritual death by being born again because we are loosed from that original Union by Death right and so we realize that even the union between a man and a woman there's only one thing that can lose those people with that Union as the scripture says as long as that man is alive she is bound to her husband as long as he liveth right and as long as that woman is alive he is bound to that woman as long as she liveth amen well why then did Moses give us a bill of divorcement he said because of the uh the hardness of your heart but it wasn't so from the beginning you're trying to say brother stepen marriage and divorce is not so from the beginning that's exactly what I'm saying amen young people guys choose your wife prayerfully you got one shot yeah one shot you mess it up you're bound yeah until the other passes away same thing girls don't mess it up don't get all infatuated with the one Prince charman that comes along on his White Horse and really broad shoulders and tells you you're pretty guess what he might be lying if he's a sinner he's probably lying got one shot you mess it up you're done well so and so got so so and so is married divorced and remarried that's tough how do you say about that brother Stephen I say this in Simplicity and God knows my heart am that's between them and God amen amen right but everything we believe comes back to the scripture sir right yes sir until death do us part so it is with our spiritual life our natural Union with our carnal man and Satan guess what through spiritual death guess what has happened we've been loosed from it Hallelujah because God is not going to marry a woman who is still bound to a man good but he'll marry a woman who is free yes and is able to be married yes hallelujah amen amen and so now we see that we are married to Christ the word becoming one with the word through our invisible Union with him amen so now our Union guess what we don't necessarily see it right off the bat but as a man and a woman when they first get married and they're and they're younger guess what they we really don't know what love is we don't know how to love one another cuz whether we want to admit it or not we're immature amen We're Young and the one thing that we love typically is ourselves we love ourselves we don't know how to love anything else but as our marriage Contin continues I'm speaking by my own experience as a man as an immature person who got married I realize that as the years go by I've been married 10 11 years here in March and I realize as each year goes on I learn more and how to love my wife amen I don't understand it right all right off the bat and as the days go on I learn more things about myself that I don't like that I need to work on and so it is with our Union with Christ when we first get married to Christ and and and we come to a new birth experience and oh my it's all it's all love and joy and and and fluffy clouds and everything's awesome we really don't know how to love God true but when our true love for God comes out of our Lives is when we are pressed in the dirt as the the the best grapes grapes just don't produce wine but they pray they're trampled upon the rose of Sharon how does it bring out that perfume it is crushed and so when we go through life and we're pressed and we're crushed and many things happen to us that we don't understand why it brings out a love for God if we've been born again amen it brings out a love for God in our hearts and we realize and we learn how to love God Amen right Lord very good and so now as the days go on as we that's right brother you hear these these Elders brother Ron will say he'll say uh I love God more now than when I did when I first got converted well you don't understand that until you're further down the road the truth of the matter is you know how to love him more amen you know how to love God more because you've been in the relationship for a longer time hallelujah amen amen so if these 10,000 times 10,000s that stood before him are sinners with their books opened who then is these other people these thousands times thousands that Minister onto him on this day of the great white Throne judgment questions and answers 1964 brother Brenham answers it now notice in this second Resurrection when they come up then Satan's loosed uh I already read that one I'll read it again out of his prison for a little season then the judgment is set now watch Jesus with the bride as king and queen at the throne white Throne judgment and the books were opened the book of Sinners and another book was opened which was The Book of Life This Book of Life is a very important yet a complex book it's a whole sermon on its own but anyways I'll hit at the high points know ye not um and every man that was judged thus by the bride so who are who are these people judged by they're judged by the bride king and queen know ye not taken these little manners before the law know ye not that the Saints shall judge the Earth CC all right what is brother brandham doing exactly what a prophet is supposed to do he brings us back to the scripture amen here's another one the first seal the queen of Heaven is the selected bride of Christ and she comes with him Daniel saw it what is he talking about he's talking about remember there's three comings of the Lord come to redeem his bride he comes with his bride for his bride and then he comes with his bride okay so he's saying there uh she comes with him Daniel saw it and said 10,000 times 10,000s ministered to him now if you'll watch the scripture the judgment was set and the books were open now remember when he come he come with his bride the wife ministers to her husband and 10,000s time 10 thousands of thousands ministered to him judgment was set and the books were opened and another book was opened which is The Book of Life not the bride at all right he said she has done gone up in the Rapture and come back and standing there in Judgment of those Generations that refuse the gospel message who are these people that is sitting judging with King Jesus it's the bride 1 Corinthians 6 verse 2 do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smaller matters the bride of Christ does not stand judgment on that day at at the white Throne judgment why because she has already received her judgment being bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh she was judged as the body of Christ was judged that day at Calvary amen hallelujah amen glory hallelujah amen her name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life which is a part of the book of life it is not a separate book there is not three books there's not the books of the Sinners uh The Book of Life and the Lamb's Book of Life as three separate books there's two books there's the books to the Sinners there's the Lamb's Book there's the book of life but written within the Book of Life there is a section that is called the Lamb's Book of Life and written in that section of the book of life is the names of of every single predestinated son and daughter of God from the time of Ephesus right up until now who are these people that's written within this section it's the Lamb's wife and the Lamb's wife now she is bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh she is him so therefore brother Bram always told us and he said that that God is going to judge the World by Jesus Christ who is the word so now here stands his bride with him they are one and they are the same so when the Judgment comes forth and they're being judged guess what Sinners they're just hey sinner this old life this this book of sin that I have of you um this book yeah there you go I have a place prepared for you I'm not even going to waste my time hardly on you cuz I know you're in this you have this book but there are those in the Book of Life brother brandham says such as foolish virgin even Judas is scariot had his name written within the book of life and brother brandham said his name was blotted out of the book why because he sold out he sold his Birthright he was justified he was Sanctified he cast out devils he took care of the money he did all these different things he had a walk with God he walked with the disciples but yet when it came down the time to be truly born again yes to truly be sealed of God to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he sold out for 30 pieces of silver amen go read the quotes brother bradam says and here's you Methodist and you Baptist and you different ones that have been presented with the word of God for this day you're selling out your birth rights why for a meal ticket because you're scared of what somebody else is going to say whatever it might be hey you've sold out I'm blotting your name out of The Book of Life TR my it gets really deep yes really quick yeah gets really serious yeah I saw a quote and I should have printed it I got a few more minutes here I should have printed it brother brandham goes he's talking about the people that that are out in the jungles and he says those people that never hear the gospel this quote struck me he said that they've never heard the gospel God has a place for those people yes because he is a just God right and he is a fair God and he'll never bring anybody into judgment unless they've heard the word to be judged by right but he says you people that know the word and you've heard the word he said if you don't go and tell them they're blood is on you and we will be held accountable for not spreading the truth of the Gospel of this end time my my my my my and here some of us were scared to share that God sent the prophet with our neighbor on that we're scared to tell the people at work this is exactly what I believe I believe God sent the prophet I believe that these scriptures are have have been fulfilled in this end time we need to be careful my brother and my sister if God gives us opportunity to share of the hope that lays within us don't shy away from it because God might hold us accountable for that person never hearing truth amen any moment you get in your life any moment that I get in my life we should be saying father how can I share the truth with this person amen amen how can I tell this person the truth within the assembly it goes further than just sharing what we believe but if you know somebody is doing wrong and you don't say anything about it how much is God going to hold to our charge of the things that we hold back because we're scared to say truth amen my my my my my God help us amen father God that when we have opportunity yes sir and you'll know it yes sir you'll know it tomorrow God's going to give some of you an opportunity tomorrow did you know that to share what you believe with somebody else and you're going to remember these words and you're going to be scared and you're going to be bashful and there's going to be many thoughts that'll come to your mind and you'll say say well I'm in a place of authority and I'm I'm a I'm a CEO and I'm this and I'm that and and I can't no no no God has given you opportunity take the opportunity because God only uses his body to share the word amen come back and tell me too send me a text message let me know cuz I know it'll happen because God will give the opportunity amen thank you Lord as the musicians come what day awaits us what a day the day of the great white Throne judgment I wonder if throughout this sermon this evening and you've been hearing it and you've been listening I wonder what part of the Judgment you see yourself on I wonder do you see do you do uh do you do you pull more towards the ones that are ministering onto God and you say my I know that I know something's changed in my life and and I know that uh I know I'm going to be there and I don't understand why but I know amen are you on the other side say my I see my book my book is open it is before my very face and I see that I I haven't fully come in to the body of Christ I haven't fully surrendered myself and I know that God forbid if something were to happen my my I see myself on the wrong side of the Judgment where do you see yourself this evening right so thought-provoking isn't it go ahead it is going to be a great and Dreadful day amen for those who are caught on the wrong side of the sand that'll be true Grace real Grace cuz there will be those brother Bram said that their books were never even in the book of life but they were good to the bride amen cup of water oh I saw you in need I helped you here you go here you go wow they was never born again never went to church but yet because of the goodness of their heart towards a son or a daughter of God they receive eternal [Music] life so what is what is this all about as as I think of the many trials and temptations the crushing de pressings that we go through in life what is it all about what is the purpose of it I know for one thing that God is molding our [Music] character and he's wanting us to get rid of this old carnal nature and to take on the character of Christ who learned obedience by the things he suffered that's right and the more things that we go through in life and the many issues that arise God's doing it for a purpose because power without character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule amen it's fit to judge you know as the Bride of Jesus Christ at that time we will become the full word and full manifestation that's right you won't have to deal with your carnal man anymore and when those people come up to be judged before you you're not going to have to go well well let me look in the scripture and let me see where that is wrong written within the word because because I got to judge it by the word no you'll be so United with the word that the word within you it won't just be on the tip of your tongue but it'll come out like a well of Living Water amen and at one time when it used to be grace in our lives as a bride of Christ which is what we're living in right now that Grace will turn to judgment who are these people these 10 these thousands times thousands is none other than the Bride of Jesus Christ why are they there because they have become the word amen who are these other people these other people are sinners who's this one thank God for prophetic Insight because without the inside of Malachi 4 guess what we would have no idea what these scriptures mean we would have no idea who these people are we would have no idea what these books are and what they represent but because we have an insight a prophetic Insight guess what now we can look with our wondering eyes and we can say wow that's what the scripture said and now we can take a magnifying glass and we can put it upon it with a message book and go before our wondering eyes good the word is being fulfilled and the word is being manifested praise the Lord let's stand together I trust that that you've been blessed this evening it's just another little part in the drama of God of God unfolding himself to us as the Bride of Jesus Christ knowing that when this time on this Earth is over as time as we know it guess what God still isn't finished with us yet but he'll have a work for us to do Hallelujah let's pray father Lord I certainly thank you for this for this thought Lord that you've placed on our heart and and father God of of a time of of judgment that lays ahead Lord and perhaps Lord there are some no doubt that as we were ministering they can see their their book of their natural life that lays before them and father I ask that this would be thought provoking to them to realize that nothing can be hid from you Lord that All Things are Written in the Journal of Our Lives of the wrong things that we have done but father God not to end on that note but to realize that there has been a lamb that was slain before the foundations of the world that by having faith in the finished work of Calvary through a born again exper erience this old book that had all those things written against us father is destroyed in the sea of your forgetfulness thank you Lord never to be remembered no more and now we live by a new book now we live Lord by an open book A book our our book used to contain words of death and sorrow and and and evil things but now this this new book Lord it produces a life of good it produces a life of sanctification of of Holiness of love and and not hatred Lord the things that are completely opposite to our carnal man and so father I just ask that you would just be with us now the remainder of the week Lord as we go to bed tonight father may you speak to us may we have the eyes Sal of the Holy Spirit Lord father God to look into the depths of our lives and to see where we need you more father I love you and thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen I want to encourage you so much of the time we get caught up with our carnal man because it's what we know amen it's what we've lived with for all these years those of you that are a part of the economy of God I'm going to give it to everybody you judge yourself you need to stop trying to dig up the old book of remembrance that is cast into the sea of God's forgetfulness when Satan brings to your remembrance of the things that you've done wrong tell him Satan my name has been transferred to another book Hallelujah and so though I am wrong in some things and I fall and I fail and I overreact and I do all of these different things Satan by Revelation I'm telling you that old book that you're talking about it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness therefore you cannot hold it against me any longer I am free I am freed by the blood of Jesus Christ remind yourself these things on a daily daily basis because in a daily basis you will be tempted on a daily basis it will be brought to your Rememberance but on a daily basis if you bring that to his remembrance tell him where you're destined for guess what it'll make you free in this life hallelujah amen let go of it amen praise God some of you just want misery amen some of you are happier when you're miserable because you feel like you deserve for God to uh you don't feel like you deserve to be free you don't feel like you deserve the love of God in your life you don't feel like you deserve that you should be that you should worship God in Freedom because of your past mistakes that's a lie of Satan and Satan I'm telling you right now I feel God really inspiring in this to me right now some of you are holding on to those thoughts you're holding on to that old book when it doesn't even exist anymore it's time for you to let go and to let God it's time for you to let go of bondage and live in the Liberty where Christ has set us free brother Steven you don't understand what I've done yeah I don't understand I don't need to know it is none of my business is between you and God praise God I don't understand I only understand my own self amen where I've went wrong but my name is not upon this old book anymore that old tattered up good for nothing sinful use whatever a if you want to use in there but it's been changed there's been a transfer and by the
