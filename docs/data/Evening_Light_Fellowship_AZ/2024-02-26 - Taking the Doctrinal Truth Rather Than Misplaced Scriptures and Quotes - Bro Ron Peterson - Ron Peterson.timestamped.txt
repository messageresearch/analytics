[59:50] bless you thank you musicians and the
[59:53] song specials they were
[59:55] very very nice second Timothy 2 then
[59:58] we'll go to 2 Timothy
[1:00:01] 4 amen second Timothy is quite a quite a
[1:00:06] book because Paul is
[1:00:08] admonishing uh Timothy as his son uh in
[1:00:12] the scriptures and he's he's admonishing
[1:00:15] him because false doctrines and seducing
[1:00:18] Spirits have come and different ones and
[1:00:21] and uh some have taken others off and uh
[1:00:25] uh so he admonishes him and uh tells him
[1:00:30] these things so uh Second Timothy chap 2
[1:00:34] and I'd like to read verses 14-
[1:00:37] 18 of these things put them in
[1:00:40] remembrance charging them before the
[1:00:42] Lord that they strive not about with
[1:00:45] words to no profit but to the subverting
[1:00:49] of the
[1:00:51] hearers study to show thyself approved
[1:00:54] unto God a Workman that needeth not to
[1:00:58] be ashamed rightly dividing the word of
[1:01:03] truth but shun profane and vain
[1:01:07] babblings for they will increase unto
[1:01:10] more
[1:01:12] ungodliness and their word will eat as
[1:01:15] doth a
[1:01:16] canker of whom is hus and
[1:01:21] filus who concerning the truth of ER
[1:01:25] saying that the resurrection is
[1:01:28] passed already and overthrow the faith
[1:01:31] of
[1:01:32] some could you imagine those that were
[1:01:35] following the word of the hour in that
[1:01:38] time and they had added to and taken
[1:01:41] away and they come up with a new
[1:01:44] revelation that guess what the
[1:01:46] resurrection's already
[1:01:48] passed and overthrew the
[1:01:51] faith of
[1:01:53] some
[1:01:55] five second Timothy chter
[1:01:58] 4 verses 2-
[1:02:02] 4 preach the word be instant in season
[1:02:06] out of season reprove rebuke exhort with
[1:02:09] all longsuffering IND
[1:02:12] doct for the time will come when they
[1:02:15] will not endure sound
[1:02:17] Doctrine but after their own lusts shall
[1:02:21] they Heap to themselves teachers
[1:02:25] having itching ears and they shall turn
[1:02:28] away their ears from the
[1:02:30] truth and they shall be turned unto
[1:02:34] fables what is a
[1:02:37] fable there are stories that are passed
[1:02:40] down but said it was true but it's not
[1:02:45] it's a fictitious story could you
[1:02:48] imagine going away from the truth unto
[1:02:50] some Fable God help us God bless you you
[1:02:53] may be seated this this morning may God
[1:02:55] add the blessing to the reading of his
[1:03:00] word
[1:03:03] now
[1:03:07] uh I would like to title my sermon this
[1:03:10] morning and it's kind of odd and kind of
[1:03:13] different it's going to be a little bit
[1:03:15] of a teaching service and so I want to
[1:03:18] take it a little bit
[1:03:20] slowly and uh to show you because I
[1:03:23] believe that uh
[1:03:24] a Workman should study the word of
[1:03:27] God and that he's not ashamed that he
[1:03:30] rightly devis the word of truth yes amen
[1:03:34] amen I want to title my sermon this
[1:03:36] morning and listen
[1:03:37] carefully taking the doctrinal
[1:03:41] truth rather than a misplaced
[1:03:44] scriptures or
[1:03:46] quotes now how do we get all of these
[1:03:49] isms within the
[1:03:52] message they start with a quote
[1:03:56] they start with the scripture did not
[1:03:59] Satan come to Eve right in the garden
[1:04:04] and quote to her
[1:04:05] scripture brother Bram said the channel
[1:04:08] of reasoning don't you want to be like
[1:04:12] God and he just added to take take away
[1:04:18] and I'd like to take a subject this
[1:04:20] morning of The Book of Life in the
[1:04:24] Lamb's Book of Life amen I want to look
[1:04:26] at this I want to know the doctrinal
[1:04:29] teaching
[1:04:31] yes and I've done quite an exhaustive
[1:04:35] search myself of
[1:04:37] this and I want to bring to you some of
[1:04:41] the findings that I've seen so that we
[1:04:45] will be a very well balanced in our
[1:04:48] understanding concerning Book of Life
[1:04:50] and the Lamb's Book of
[1:04:52] Life and so before we go any further
[1:04:55] what I'd like to do is let's read some
[1:04:57] more scripture to lay a foundation of
[1:05:00] which I want to launch off into so we'll
[1:05:03] go to 2
[1:05:05] Peter

[1:05:53] ever ever lasting Kingdom of our Lord
[1:05:55] and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will
[1:05:59] not be negligent to put you always in

[1:06:06] them and be established in the present
[1:06:10] truth amen yeah I think it meet as long
[1:06:13] as I am in this
[1:06:15] Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you
[1:06:19] in
[1:06:20] remembrance that's all I want to do a
[1:06:22] faithful minister
[1:06:24] just put you in remembrance of what's
[1:06:26] already been said I have no message of
[1:06:30] my own there's been a messenger
[1:06:33] come a seventh angel messenger one
[1:06:38] prophesied according to
[1:06:40] scripture and his message has become my
[1:06:44] message re uh Revelation chapter
[1:06:48] 22 verses 18-
[1:06:53] 21
[1:06:55] for I testify unto every man that
[1:06:58] heareth the words of the prophecy of
[1:07:00] this book If any man shall add unto
[1:07:05] these things God shall add unto him the
[1:07:07] plagues that are written in this
[1:07:11] book and if any man shall take away from
[1:07:14] the words of the book of this prophecy
[1:07:18] yeah God shall take away his part out of
[1:07:22] The Book of Life
[1:07:24] yeah and out of the holy city and from
[1:07:28] the things which are written in this
[1:07:31] book
[1:07:32] yeah he which testifieth these things
[1:07:35] sayith surely I come quickly amen even
[1:07:39] so come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord
[1:07:43] Jesus Christ be with you all
[1:07:48] amen
[1:07:50] now I want all of you to understand that
[1:07:53] the vast
[1:07:54] majority if you were to study this at
[1:07:58] home on your computer at your own
[1:08:01] convenient time and you know that you
[1:08:03] can put in parentheses to for example if
[1:08:07] you want to study the Book of Life put
[1:08:09] it in parentheses and look at it within
[1:08:13] uh the message of the hour but always
[1:08:16] you go back to the scripture first where
[1:08:19] is it mentioned about the book brother
[1:08:22] Brenham calls it the title deed of
[1:08:25] redemption right he says this book of
[1:08:28] redemption that went back into the hand
[1:08:30] of its original owner we know that it's
[1:08:34] been returned back to the church Adam
[1:08:37] lost his right to eternal life he lost
[1:08:41] his position in the garden right right
[1:08:44] he lost his dominion over the Earth and
[1:08:48] over uh the animals yes so we understand
[1:08:53] he lost something what was that he lost
[1:08:55] his right to that Eternal book of
[1:09:00] redemption but God rich in Mercy he knew
[1:09:04] exactly he wasn't ringing his hands in
[1:09:07] heaven in fact he knew this would happen
[1:09:11] and he had provided a way before the
[1:09:15] foundation of the
[1:09:18] world praise
[1:09:21] God
[1:09:22] so I want you to notice that when you do
[1:09:26] this
[1:09:27] study that the vast majority of the
[1:09:30] quotes when you type in The Book of Life
[1:09:35] you will find that I would say well over
[1:09:38] majority let's call it 90% of the quotes
[1:09:41] brother Brenham says he who adds to and
[1:09:44] takes away and he's quoting what I quote
[1:09:47] quoted you from The Book of
[1:09:50] Revelation so it's extremely important
[1:09:53] everybody body know you do not add to
[1:09:57] and take away amen if more preachers
[1:10:00] within this message would listen to that
[1:10:04] they would not be so free to say well
[1:10:07] here's my
[1:10:08] interpretation I don't need your
[1:10:10] interpretation I don't want your opinion
[1:10:13] now if it is your opinion state it this
[1:10:16] is my opinion because I have opinions
[1:10:19] and I have a right as a student of the
[1:10:21] word of God and then I tell you here's
[1:10:23] my opinion
[1:10:25] okay and you just take it as my opinion
[1:10:27] right and uh now we're going to be
[1:10:30] looking at some of these
[1:10:32] quotes and we're going to first start in
[1:10:34] the
[1:10:35] scriptures and then we'll go
[1:10:38] into uh the message of the
[1:10:41] hour now when you take the Lamb's Book
[1:10:44] of Life and you put it in
[1:10:47] parentheses and you research it
[1:10:49] throughout the message he refers to the
[1:10:52] Lamb's Book of of Life 261
[1:10:56] times so I have read every
[1:10:59] quote I have looked at it in
[1:11:02] detail then you take the Book of Life
[1:11:07] parentheses
[1:11:09] 518 times I've read every quote I look
[1:11:13] at it in detail because there might be
[1:11:16] some that he said in there but can we
[1:11:18] read all of those quotes here this
[1:11:20] morning no no so what I do
[1:11:24] is I go and I take just a few because
[1:11:27] for the sake of time I want you to go
[1:11:30] home and let you do the study yourself
[1:11:33] you read the quotes you see what he says
[1:11:35] and then you find out
[1:11:38] really where and then he he type in the
[1:11:41] book of The Living it's only mentioned
[1:11:44] one time so when you study the message
[1:11:47] you have to understand that the
[1:11:50] message that was coming to the messenger
[1:11:54] was according to his season of
[1:11:57] understanding that's right he didn't
[1:11:59] fully understand this gift that he had
[1:12:03] and to pray for kings and
[1:12:05] monarchs and on and on while his early
[1:12:08] Missionary Baptist pastor told him it's
[1:12:12] of the devil he had to go and pray and
[1:12:14] the angel had to come and just correct
[1:12:16] him and bring him back into balance so
[1:12:19] it was an unfolding Revelation to him so
[1:12:23] there are things that brother Brenham
[1:12:25] taught doctrinally listen to me now he
[1:12:30] taught doctrinally before the opening of
[1:12:32] the
[1:12:33] seals that when the opening of the seals
[1:12:36] comes God corrects that wrong
[1:12:39] doctrine that do does that offend
[1:12:43] anybody it should not offend any of you
[1:12:46] because God has let us see within the
[1:12:49] scriptures that every one of God's
[1:12:52] prophets and men of God made their
[1:12:56] mistakes they were human beings just
[1:12:58] like you and
[1:13:00] I and so brother Brenham says I'll show
[1:13:02] you by God's word he said that God's
[1:13:06] prophets have all made their mistakes a
[1:13:08] direct quote and he says but God makes
[1:13:12] no mistakes so what you have to do when
[1:13:15] you take the message of the hour and you
[1:13:17] begin to study it you have to study it
[1:13:21] in a chronological order amen because he
[1:13:24] may say something up to the opening of
[1:13:26] the first seal as an example white horse
[1:13:29] rider right amen many of the the sermons
[1:13:34] that he preaches that he titles the same
[1:13:38] uh the mighty
[1:13:39] conqueror every one of those prior to
[1:13:41] the opening of the first seal guess what
[1:13:44] that Mighty conqueror riding on a white
[1:13:46] horse was Jesus Christ and he says oh
[1:13:49] when I came to the opening of that first
[1:13:51] seal the angel come and told me
[1:13:54] incorrect
[1:13:56] wrong he says it shows that you need to
[1:13:59] stay before God to let him and I've said
[1:14:03] to this to you before the rest of you
[1:14:05] that you might understand God took this
[1:14:08] message and gave to us a sign of
[1:14:11] circumcision he cut off all the flesh a
[1:14:14] former
[1:14:15] teaching Clarence Len and all of the
[1:14:19] different ones
[1:14:22] the are you understanding that because
[1:14:25] all of that brother Bram said I looked
[1:14:27] into the Glorious Reformation I look at
[1:14:30] hops 2 Babylons and he names this he did
[1:14:32] a lot of reading TR yes that's right and
[1:14:36] so he was trying to take those men who
[1:14:38] probed at these things what they meant
[1:14:42] right amen and he says so he took from
[1:14:44] their teaching yes but my with the
[1:14:47] opening of those seals he got alone with
[1:14:51] God and he said I have no idea God I am
[1:14:54] I am just helpless without you I have no
[1:14:56] idea what that first seal is amen lays
[1:15:00] himself before God and here an angel
[1:15:02] walks into the room and he breaks to him
[1:15:05] the revelation of the first seal my what
[1:15:09] a supernatural gospel we have
[1:15:13] so if you isolate the scripture or take
[1:15:17] it out of text you come up with the
[1:15:20] wrong interpretation of the word and you
[1:15:23] become
[1:15:27] imbalanced eat drink and be merried for
[1:15:29] tomorrow we die that's in the
[1:15:32] scripture if we preach that out of text
[1:15:35] yeah let's just go do our
[1:15:39] thing or an eye for an eye a tooth for a
[1:15:42] tooth do you see what I'm saying so you
[1:15:45] take scripture out of text you can make
[1:15:48] it say something they did it with the
[1:15:51] disciples Jesus said about John what is
[1:15:54] it unto you if if this man terries until
[1:15:57] I come and the Bible says and the S wind
[1:16:00] among the Brethren that John shall not
[1:16:02] see death right but I John testify unto
[1:16:06] you he didn't say
[1:16:09] that he just said what is it unto you if
[1:16:12] he Terry still Ain
[1:16:13] come do you see what I'm saying so they
[1:16:16] took words of Jesus and made a doctrinal
[1:16:21] teaching are they made a teaching out of
[1:16:24] it but didn't take his
[1:16:25] Doctrine understand so I want to take
[1:16:28] doctrinal teaching let's look at it
[1:16:31] chronologically are you with me in that
[1:16:35] understanding and so uh a few of these
[1:16:38] others body Spirit Soul he taught Body
[1:16:44] Soul Spirit prior to the opening of the
[1:16:46] first
[1:16:47] seal after the seals he said oh no no
[1:16:51] body spirit soul soul is the inside it's
[1:16:56] the holy of
[1:16:57] holies born again and sealed to
[1:17:00] adoption brother Brenham when you go
[1:17:03] through the adoption series you will see
[1:17:05] that he clearly
[1:17:08] differentiates and I will go into some
[1:17:10] more of that perhaps because we got some
[1:17:13] quotes um you take uh seven years of
[1:17:16] tribulation it's amazing right now how
[1:17:18] many men in the message ministers right
[1:17:22] now
[1:17:23] this week are preaching we have seven
[1:17:26] years of
[1:17:28] tribulation that the 70th week hasn't
[1:17:31] even started it's going to be the
[1:17:33] Rapture of the church and then the
[1:17:35] tribulation starts seven years of
[1:17:38] tribulation and and they get it all
[1:17:40] mixed up and I ask why don't you keep
[1:17:42] reading that's
[1:17:44] right brother brandham answers the
[1:17:47] question but prior to like have any of
[1:17:50] you ever seen the graph that he drew
[1:17:53] and he shows the church ages and he says
[1:17:56] and here's the Rapture of the church and
[1:17:58] then he puts seven years of
[1:18:00] tribulation any of you ever seen that
[1:18:03] well that's being going brought around
[1:18:05] to people oh my brother Brenham Drew
[1:18:07] this
[1:18:08] graph yeah prior to the opening of the
[1:18:11] seals prior to his understanding he
[1:18:15] didn't even understand Daniel 70
[1:18:19] weeks okay so we're together on that
[1:18:22] aren't we
[1:18:23] otherwise you're going to get confused
[1:18:25] is it 7 years is it 3 and 1/2 years when
[1:18:29] was uh Christ cut off in the midst when
[1:18:32] did the 70th Week begin when was it cut
[1:18:35] off when does it start again uh we got
[1:18:38] answers but it's in the message you got
[1:18:40] to keep
[1:18:41] reading absolutely that's right uh
[1:18:46] here's a good quote I'm just throw this
[1:18:47] up here just because in this one quote
[1:18:50] he kind of covers a lot of this
[1:18:52] doctrinal teaching just watch this
[1:18:54] questions and answers
[1:18:57] 1964 the church age ended and has
[1:19:00] blacked out the bride is called and we
[1:19:03] have already entered into the
[1:19:05] tribulation period this is a question
[1:19:07] yeah oh my church age ended we've
[1:19:10] already blacked out remember there's no
[1:19:12] more light it's gone into total darkness
[1:19:15] right and we've already entered into the
[1:19:18] tribulation period no no
[1:19:21] no
[1:19:24] the bride when she's taken from the
[1:19:27] church the bride when she's taken from
[1:19:30] the church then the church age will
[1:19:33] cease so when does the church age cease
[1:19:37] L you seea God's no longer dealing with
[1:19:40] the times of the
[1:19:43] Gentiles Christ leaves The Mercy Seat no
[1:19:47] more
[1:19:48] blood so he said there'll not be another
[1:19:51] Gentile Sav D why God's not dealing with
[1:19:54] Gentiles anymore that's right so those
[1:19:57] listen doctrin that that are
[1:20:01] martyred the Gentile Remnant that's left
[1:20:05] over right they give their lives but
[1:20:09] when were they
[1:20:12] saved we'll get into this church H Lota
[1:20:17] goes off into chaos the bride goes to
[1:20:20] glory and the tribulation sets in
[1:20:23] upon the who sleeping or foolish virgin
[1:20:28] are we
[1:20:29] together for three and A2 years they're
[1:20:32] there's finishing the last half of the
[1:20:35] 70th week amen while Israel is getting
[1:20:39] its
[1:20:40] prophecy then tribulation sets in upon
[1:20:44] Israel then comes the battle of
[1:20:46] Armageddon which destroys all things and
[1:20:49] then the bride returns back with the
[1:20:51] groom for for a thousand years the
[1:20:54] millennial
[1:20:55] Reign after that comes the white Throne
[1:20:58] judgment right after that comes the new
[1:21:01] heavens and the new Earth and the new
[1:21:04] city coming down from God out of heaven
[1:21:06] in eternity and time Blends
[1:21:09] together how different ones within the
[1:21:12] message now message preachers are
[1:21:14] preaching we're in the
[1:21:15] Millennium raptures already happened it
[1:21:17] was spiritual we're in the Millennium
[1:21:20] wow
[1:21:21] my so these are just a few of the
[1:21:25] teachings that's going on because they
[1:21:28] have their certain quotes they isolate
[1:21:30] that quote I I've often said this I
[1:21:34] don't I give you quotes I show you but I
[1:21:37] tell you the best thing for you to do is
[1:21:39] go back and listen to the
[1:21:41] tape cuz I can only give you a portion
[1:21:45] if you want to hear the fullness of it
[1:21:47] go back and listen to the tape then
[1:21:48] you'll hear it in its full
[1:21:51] perspective so some have said well
[1:21:54] brother Ron why don't you teach us
[1:21:55] what's wrong with every ISM or every
[1:21:58] false Doctrine within the message I
[1:22:00] don't have time let's preach the truth
[1:22:04] of the true
[1:22:05] message and let's study the
[1:22:08] real that when the counterfeit comes up
[1:22:11] you say ha that's counterfeit man do you
[1:22:15] know when they study the US currency
[1:22:19] yeah the people that work at Banks and
[1:22:22] they they never study a counterfeit they
[1:22:25] study the real that's right and they
[1:22:28] know it so well they put it up to the
[1:22:30] light yeah looks like the real thing why
[1:22:34] been studying Amen to know that this is
[1:22:39] the real thing should also be in your
[1:22:43] heart let's study the real thing amen
[1:22:46] three things that the prophet of God
[1:22:49] said we must not do now you ought to
[1:22:53] write that in the front of your
[1:22:55] Bible and he said three things you must
[1:22:59] never do why is to misinterpret the
[1:23:04] scriptures do you think God will turn to
[1:23:08] cheek and just it's okay my son's
[1:23:11] misinterpreting the scripture the very
[1:23:14] thing I said don't
[1:23:16] do he said do you do you think God's
[1:23:19] going to just turn a blinded eye and I'm
[1:23:22] going to let him because I love him so
[1:23:24] much I'm going to let him misinterpret
[1:23:26] the
[1:23:27] scripture No God's an
[1:23:31] exact don't misinterpret the scriptures
[1:23:34] don't misplace the scriptures well that
[1:23:38] belongs over here and this and that
[1:23:40] that's why hus and
[1:23:43] filus misplaced the scriptures they gave
[1:23:46] their own interpretation guess what they
[1:23:48] came up with a new doctrine
[1:23:50] resurrection's already passed
[1:23:53] and overthrew the faith of
[1:23:56] some and to
[1:23:59] dislocate he said to take it out of its
[1:24:01] true
[1:24:02] position so three things misinterpret
[1:24:05] misplace dislocate now I'll show you
[1:24:08] these quotes and I'm going to uh I'm
[1:24:12] going to tell you that I'm going to show
[1:24:14] you some quotes that if you don't know
[1:24:17] his doctrinal teaching you might think
[1:24:20] oh my our message is full of all kinds
[1:24:23] of erors right okay but I've told you
[1:24:29] remember because if we isolate a quote
[1:24:32] from 1957 and we start teaching on that
[1:24:35] right then we could come up with some
[1:24:38] kind of false Doctrine out here did the
[1:24:40] prophet of God say it look at it that's
[1:24:42] right where they say what he
[1:24:44] said but man haven't you kept
[1:24:48] reading okay
[1:24:50] so for this morning I want to take a
[1:24:53] detailed look first at we'll go to the
[1:24:57] scriptures and I want to look at
[1:24:59] everywhere it speaks of or pertains to
[1:25:04] the Book of Life okay so I want to have
[1:25:08] you you don't need to turn with me cuz
[1:25:10] we'll have it on the overhead but if you

[1:25:18] me because we're going to go quick quick

[1:25:58] talking about the book of life right
[1:26:00] amen we're seeing Snippets of where the
[1:26:04] first place we can see where it's
[1:26:06] mentioned about the Book of
[1:26:09] Life Daniel
[1:26:11] 7 veres 9 and 10 and I beheld till
[1:26:16] Thrones were cast down and the Ancient
[1:26:18] of Days did sit whose garment was white
[1:26:21] as snow on the hair of his head like
[1:26:23] pure wool his throne was like the fiery
[1:26:26] flame and his wheels as burning fire a
[1:26:29] fiery stream issued and came forth from

[1:27:47] book of the life of the Lamb excuse me
[1:27:54] I'm I I I I I'm sorry I passed it up I'm
[1:27:57] sorry let's go back to Psalms I just
[1:28:00] looked down on my notes I'm sorry Psalm
[1:28:04] 69 verse 27 and
[1:28:07] 28 add iniquity under their iniquity and
[1:28:10] let them not come into thy righteousness
[1:28:12] here's David under an inspiration let
[1:28:15] them be blotted out of the book of the
[1:28:19] living and not be written with the
[1:28:21] righteous
[1:28:23] now I want to take this that's the Old
[1:28:26] Testament we want to bring it down in
[1:28:27] the New Testament righten so what is the
[1:28:30] New Testament say about it first writing
[1:28:33] of The Book of Life Philippians 4: 2 and
[1:28:37] 3 I beseech
[1:28:39] udias and beseech
[1:28:42] cage that's however you say it that they
[1:28:46] be of the same mind in the Lord and I
[1:28:48] entreat thee also true yoke
[1:28:50] fellow help those women which labored
[1:28:53] with me in the gospel with Clement also
[1:28:56] and with other my fellow laborers whose
[1:28:59] names are written where in the book of
[1:29:02] life now we're talking book of life
[1:29:05] right now we'll go to the Lamb's Book of
[1:29:07] Life here in a
[1:29:11] moment Revelations 3 verse 5 and he that
[1:29:16] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[1:29:18] white Raymond and I will not block his
[1:29:21] name name blot out his name out of the
[1:29:25] book of life but I will confess his name
[1:29:28] before my father and before his
[1:29:32] angels now this next one I got it out of
[1:29:37] order but I'm going to leave it there
[1:29:39] because I will cover it over when I go
[1:29:41] to the book of the life of the lamb but
[1:29:43] let's look at this Revelations 13
[1:29:47] 8-9 all that dwell upon the Earth shall
[1:29:50] worship Him
[1:29:52] whose names are not written in the Book
[1:29:54] of Life of the Lamb you see the wording
[1:29:58] changed a little bit wasn't Lamb's Book
[1:30:00] of Life but the Book of Life of the lamb
[1:30:04] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:30:06] if any man have an ear let him here yeah
[1:30:09] Revelation
[1:30:11] 17:8 the Beast which thou sawest was and
[1:30:15] is not shall Ascend out of the
[1:30:16] bottomless pit and go into predition and
[1:30:20] they that dwell on the Earth shall
[1:30:21] wonder whose names were not written in
[1:30:24] the Book of Life from the foundation of
[1:30:27] the world they behold the Beast that was
[1:30:29] and is not and yet
[1:30:31] is Revelations
[1:30:34] 20 11-2 and I saw a great white Throne
[1:30:38] so where are we at now great white
[1:30:40] throne and he that sat on it whose face
[1:30:44] the Earth and Heaven fled away and there
[1:30:46] was found no place for them I saw the
[1:30:49] dead small and great stand before before
[1:30:52] God and the books were
[1:30:53] opened and another book was opened which
[1:30:57] is The Book of
[1:30:59] Life and the dead were judged out of
[1:31:01] those things which were written in the
[1:31:03] books according
[1:31:06] to their
[1:31:10] Works Revelations 204
[1:31:14] says and then death and hell were cast
[1:31:18] into the Lake of Fire this is the second
[1:31:20] death somebody say second death
[1:31:23] and whosoever was not written in the
[1:31:26] Book of
[1:31:27] Life was cast into the Lake of
[1:31:31] Fire now I want to go back for just a
[1:31:33] moment because in Revelations 20 and
[1:31:36] verse 11 there I just read it the Bible
[1:31:41] says that let me just read this again
[1:31:44] I'm sorry let me get my
[1:31:46] texture another book was open which is
[1:31:49] The Book of Life and the dead were
[1:31:50] judged out of those things so we're
[1:31:52] white
[1:31:53] Thro which were written in the books
[1:31:55] according to their
[1:31:57] works now the Bible says that if you
[1:32:01] have never heard the law of
[1:32:04] God there's another law written in your
[1:32:09] heart well what about these heathens
[1:32:12] what about the people in Africa India in
[1:32:16] different places outer parts of the
[1:32:18] earth that never heard about Jesus
[1:32:20] Christ never heard about the word of God
[1:32:21] God how will God judge them good answer
[1:32:25] good question there is an answer so let
[1:32:28] me read to you Romans
[1:32:30] 2:
[1:32:32] 11-15 for there is no respect of persons
[1:32:35] with God right for as many as have
[1:32:38] sinned without the law shall also perish
[1:32:41] without the law and as many as have
[1:32:44] sinned in the law shall be judged by the
[1:32:47] law right for not the hearers of the law
[1:32:50] are just before God but the doers of the
[1:32:52] law shall be justified and for when
[1:32:55] Gentiles watch this which have not the
[1:32:58] law they've not heard the
[1:33:00] gospel do by Nature the things contained
[1:33:03] in the law these having not the law are
[1:33:08] a law unto
[1:33:11] themselves yes watch this which show the
[1:33:14] work of the law written where is it
[1:33:16] written in their
[1:33:18] heart their conscience also buried
[1:33:21] Witness
[1:33:22] yes and their thoughts the meanwhile
[1:33:24] accusing or else excusing one another
[1:33:28] yeah look at
[1:33:30] that your own
[1:33:32] words and your own thoughts will condemn
[1:33:36] you it will not be someone else oh yes
[1:33:40] God uses by the mouth of two or more
[1:33:43] witnesses that's true but I'll tell you
[1:33:46] what if you are
[1:33:48] condemned the greatest witness against
[1:33:50] you will be you
[1:33:52] you that's good your thoughts your
[1:33:55] actions recorded and just play it back
[1:33:59] there'll be no well well I didn't mean
[1:34:01] that no you did mean it you said it you
[1:34:04] did it that's
[1:34:06] right Matthew 12:
[1:34:09] 35-37 a good man out of the good
[1:34:11] Treasure of the heart bringeth forth
[1:34:13] good
[1:34:14] things and an evil man out of the evil
[1:34:17] Treasure of bringeth forth evil things
[1:34:21] but I say unto you that Every Idle word
[1:34:24] that men shall speak they shall give
[1:34:26] account therefore in the day of
[1:34:28] judgment where we at judgment time when
[1:34:32] you going to give account on the day of
[1:34:33] judgment watch this for by thy
[1:34:37] words Thou shalt be
[1:34:40] justified or by thy words Thou shalt be
[1:34:43] condemned who will condemn
[1:34:46] you
[1:34:50] yourself good you are the greatest
[1:34:53] witness against
[1:34:56] yourself yeah there'll be others that
[1:34:58] stand there yes I heard him he said this
[1:35:00] he told
[1:35:01] me but listen once you hear it played
[1:35:05] your thoughts your actions that's right
[1:35:08] play back before you you listen You'll
[1:35:10] want to run
[1:35:15] amen true the most condemning words will
[1:35:17] be your
[1:35:19] own now I have a few referen is now
[1:35:23] to the Book of Life and the Lamb's Book
[1:35:26] of Life but we're going to start with
[1:35:28] the book of life and we're going to
[1:35:30] start this in a chronological order if
[1:35:33] you study the message you'll know that
[1:35:35] you'll get the oldest quote First you
[1:35:37] come all the way to 65 am you know that
[1:35:41] so what I did I typed in book of life
[1:35:46] parentheses so I'm giving you only a few
[1:35:50] remember I told you 28 81 of the Lamb's
[1:35:53] Book of Life 500 and some odd of The
[1:35:56] Book of Life whatever you look them up
[1:35:59] yourself okay here it is the living
[1:36:02] Jesus Christ 1953 now I do not have time
[1:36:05] to read the whole quote so I'm going to
[1:36:07] read just the highlighted portion okay
[1:36:11] so the living Jesus Christ if you put it
[1:36:13] up brotherr now the Indians when they
[1:36:17] see this power of God moving or Down in
[1:36:19] Africa over in the islands they don't
[1:36:21] question
[1:36:22] it we who's got all the scholarships
[1:36:25] we're the ones who question it he says
[1:36:29] watch this why they've explained it all
[1:36:31] out Dr so and so Dr so and so but listen
[1:36:34] God wants us to believe his word just
[1:36:36] like it's written then he quotes
[1:36:39] Revelation whosoever shall add to take
[1:36:41] away shall the same shall be taken out
[1:36:43] of his part of The Book of Life remember
[1:36:46] I told you vast majority of quotes the
[1:36:49] prophet of God talks about adding to
[1:36:50] taking
[1:36:51] away and you'll be taken out of the Book
[1:36:54] of Life brass serpent
[1:36:56] 1953 he takes away or adds to the same
[1:36:59] shall be taken out of his part out of
[1:37:02] the book of life so he wants to be sure
[1:37:04] that we keep our doctrines always on
[1:37:07] thus sayith the
[1:37:08] Lord Seven Church ages now how many of
[1:37:12] you this is
[1:37:14] 1954 brother Brenan preaches the seven
[1:37:16] Church ages in a sermon in
[1:37:20] 1954
[1:37:21] brother Brenan preaches the seven Church
[1:37:26] ages
[1:37:28] in sermon
[1:37:30] form that we call the revelation of
[1:37:33] Jesus Christ yes when did that start
[1:37:36] that was December of
[1:37:38] 1960 he preaches almost all of December
[1:37:41] of 1960 into
[1:37:44] 1961 and then later does anybody know
[1:37:47] when the seven Church age book was
[1:37:50] printed
[1:37:52] I I texted brother George Smith because
[1:37:55] he's said he he he he knows a lot of
[1:37:58] this stuff I said George when was the
[1:38:00] church AE book printed when was it
[1:38:02] handed out he said it was printed three
[1:38:04] weeks before brother renham died and he
[1:38:07] gave it out to all the ministers he said
[1:38:09] it's my book it's not Lil's book it's
[1:38:12] his book there are all kinds of
[1:38:14] different ones and I've shared with you
[1:38:16] before different on said well I talked
[1:38:17] to the prophet about burning the
[1:38:20] book
[1:38:21] well you should hear the whole story the
[1:38:24] rest of the
[1:38:25] story and because brother renom there's
[1:38:27] a couple little things that he said hey
[1:38:30] some of the wording is
[1:38:33] intellectual and he said they know that
[1:38:35] I don't talk like that well if you don't
[1:38:38] like it brother brandham why we'll take
[1:38:41] those books and we'll burn them and
[1:38:42] we'll we'll make it to where you like it
[1:38:45] he said no no no it's okay I went before
[1:38:48] the Lord and the angel said give it out
[1:38:50] yeah
[1:38:52] right so it's not lale's
[1:38:54] book in fact doctrinally speaking the
[1:38:57] seven Church age book covers every major
[1:39:00] Doctrine in the
[1:39:02] message one of the best tools if you had
[1:39:04] only one book to take with you to go
[1:39:06] somewhere and you're trying to introduce
[1:39:09] the message Church age book is a is a
[1:39:11] good one now
[1:39:15] um so
[1:39:18] 1965 three weeks before he died he gives
[1:39:21] out the church age so
[1:39:24] here here is from the sermon the seven
[1:39:26] Church ages
[1:39:31] 1954 as it's written in here he that
[1:39:34] takes out of this shall be taken out of
[1:39:37] his part out of the book of life and he
[1:39:39] who adds to it the plagues shall be
[1:39:41] poured out unto him now questions and

[1:41:56] truth let me say to you something Jesus
[1:41:59] Christ said he wrote this in the last
[1:42:01] chapter in his Bible and he shall add to

[1:42:35] say I Jesus have sent my angel to
[1:42:38] testify and he'll take out whosoever
[1:42:41] shall take out of this book or add to it
[1:42:43] same shall be taken out of his of his
[1:42:47] part The Book of Life and the plagues

[1:42:50] to to him if he takes if he adds to or
[1:42:53] takes away you see how
[1:42:55] serious deep cth to the Deep 56 the but
[1:42:59] the history of the meeting will be on
[1:43:02] the pages he's he's praying he's talking
[1:43:04] about the meeting he's having right
[1:43:06] there he said the history of the meeting
[1:43:08] will be on the pages of The Book of Life
[1:43:11] people's decisions and how they acted
[1:43:14] concerning
[1:43:16] you who do you say this is what is the
[1:43:21] attraction you follow
[1:43:26] me seven Church age the church age book
[1:43:31] this how many of you know that brother
[1:43:32] Brenham went ahead and gave it to Dr
[1:43:34] leville and he went ahead and took out
[1:43:37] all of the uh reiteration and he made it
[1:43:41] into a book form and many times when you
[1:43:44] preach sermons you go back with the
[1:43:47] sermon if you're on the uh the Third
[1:43:50] Church AG you go back a little bit into
[1:43:52] the second Church age pick up and then
[1:43:54] go into the third do the same with the
[1:43:56] third and the fourth and there's so much
[1:43:58] reiteration he said no when you read a
[1:44:00] book huh it just goes on and on because
[1:44:03] you got it from the second age now we're
[1:44:05] in the third
[1:44:07] so look at this sardian church age this
[1:44:11] is the the church age book The Book of
[1:44:14] Life is definitely located in
[1:44:17] heaven and will appear at the great
[1:44:19] white Throne judgment
[1:44:21] The Book of
[1:44:24] Life in these verses Jesus said that
[1:44:27] their names were written in heaven they
[1:44:30] were written in the Book of Life for
[1:44:32] that is where names are
[1:44:34] placed Jesus was speaking to the 70 in
[1:44:37] verse 17 but he also speaking into the
[1:44:39] 12 verse
[1:44:41] 23 these all had been rejoicing that
[1:44:44] Devils were subject to them in jesus'
[1:44:47] name Christ rejoined her never heard
[1:44:51] that word before just learned it so
[1:44:54] Christ's answer his
[1:44:57] rejoiner was Rejoice not that the
[1:44:59] spirits are subject to you but rather
[1:45:02] that your names are written in
[1:45:04] heaven Book of
[1:45:06] Life brother Brenan put that in there I
[1:45:08] did not you will know here that Judas
[1:45:11] was one of those who were casting out
[1:45:14] devils in jesus' name but we know that
[1:45:18] he was a devil the son of predition
[1:45:21] come on Jesus answered them have not I
[1:45:24] chosen you you 12 and one of you as a
[1:45:26] devil he spake of judas's scary the son
[1:45:29] of
[1:45:31] Simon how many of you know s said it
[1:45:34] would have been better that he never
[1:45:36] been born yeah
[1:45:40] amen while I was with them in the world
[1:45:43] I kept them in thy name those that thou
[1:45:47] Hast given me I have kept and none of
[1:45:49] them as lost but the son of predition
[1:45:51] that the scripture might be fulfilled so
[1:45:54] now brother Brandon paraphrase this now
[1:45:56] if language means anything at all we
[1:45:59] must admit that Judas was chosen by
[1:46:02] Jesus quotes the scripture John
[1:46:05] 13:18 yet he was not
[1:46:08] clean Judas was also given to Jesus by
[1:46:12] the Father John
[1:46:14] 1:2 Let It Be noted here that the
[1:46:17] choosing and giving is the exact parall
[1:46:21] as in the illustrations of Moses and
[1:46:24] Pharaoh Jacob and
[1:46:27] Esau for though Esau and Pharaoh were
[1:46:31] both
[1:46:32] forn they were
[1:46:36] predestinated to
[1:46:38] wrath listen I'm going to blow your mind
[1:46:42] some people are born to go to
[1:46:48] hell you can't read it any other way
[1:46:52] while the end of Moses and Jacob was

[1:53:21] knowing we know it can never be blotted
[1:53:32] out okay next quote here on Revelation
[1:53:37] CH 5 the enemy in the last days that
[1:53:40] religious enemy would get amongst people
[1:53:44] and have organizations and so forth and
[1:53:46] Cults and forth as they have today and
[1:53:49] would deceive the very elected if it was
[1:53:51] possible and would deceive all those
[1:53:53] whose names are not on the Lamb's Book
[1:53:58] of Life since the foundation of the
[1:54:01] world when was your name put on the
[1:54:03] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:54:05] foundation of the world when was Christ

[1:54:12] foundation of the world the lamb slain
[1:54:14] before the F see what it's doing in
[1:54:17] these now watch this in these seals
[1:54:20] opening up just begin to reveal the Plan
[1:54:24] of
[1:54:25] Redemption how he did it it's all over
[1:54:28] now see just about finishing up so we're
[1:54:32] at the end time that's why these things
[1:54:35] are being revealed
[1:54:37] wow the unfolding of the word he's going
[1:54:40] oh my this is
[1:54:43] amazing here it
[1:54:45] is in the second
[1:54:48] seal but there is some that's got their
[1:54:50] names written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:54:53] yeah and when them seals are throw back
[1:54:56] or throw it open there they see their
[1:54:58] name there and the Holy Spirit speaks to
[1:55:02] them yes and they
[1:55:04] come that's why when you begin to have
[1:55:07] your eyes
[1:55:10] open and the eyes have of the Holy
[1:55:13] Spirit shows you the voice behind the
[1:55:16] voice the message within the message is
[1:55:19] it you're seeing your name where Lamb's
[1:55:24] [Applause]
[1:55:28] Book and they
[1:55:30] come that's the very
[1:55:33] reason that this message has an action
[1:55:37] has an action on you to bring your
[1:55:41] reaction sir it puts you into action why
[1:55:44] I saw my name in the
[1:55:48] bookall good
[1:55:51] 1964 again I'm going to show you quotes
[1:55:54] and some of these are going to throw you
[1:55:55] a
[1:55:57] curveball just read read what he
[1:56:00] said was Judas iscariot's name blotted
[1:56:04] out of the Lamb's Book of Life or was it
[1:56:08] ever on
[1:56:10] it be careful now yeah yes it was on it
[1:56:15] and it was blotted out again I'm reading
[1:56:17] you the question
[1:56:20] was judas's scariot name
[1:56:22] on or name blotted out of the Lamb's
[1:56:26] Book of Life or was it ever on it yes it
[1:56:30] was on it and blotted out but watch he
[1:56:33] now he says Rejoice not that the devils
[1:56:37] are subject to you but Rejoice that your
[1:56:39] name is written
[1:56:41] in he's quoting now Book of
[1:56:45] Life That's Right Judas was right with
[1:56:48] them judgment was set and another book
[1:56:52] was open which was the book of life
[1:56:54] every man was judged thus so again I'm
[1:56:57] not afraid to say what he said now when
[1:57:00] you go back now I'm not giving an excuse
[1:57:02] to the prophet except for this one
[1:57:06] thing he was so hurriedly going through
[1:57:09] the
[1:57:10] questions that I think it was just a
[1:57:13] slip of his tongue because that's not
[1:57:15] his doctrinal
[1:57:18] teaching can you swallow
[1:57:25] that that's
[1:57:27] not his doctrinal question well yeah was
[1:57:30] it on the Lamb's Book of Life yeah let
[1:57:32] me see yeah yeah yeah it was on it was
[1:57:33] blotted out but that's not his doctrinal
[1:57:39] teaching again I don't want you to sit
[1:57:42] there oh man brother Ron's showing no no
[1:57:45] say what he said but let's keep going
[1:57:48] let's understand his doctrinal teaching
[1:57:51] and when you understand the doctrinal
[1:57:53] teaching when it makes a slip of the
[1:57:54] tongue he might say 700 and he
[1:57:57] meant 7,000 you going to freak out well
[1:58:00] he made a mistake or you know what I'll
[1:58:03] tell you what prophet when he says
[1:58:05] something it's thus sayith the Lord
[1:58:07] everything he
[1:58:08] says the next thing you know you got
[1:58:10] your kids and nothing but a bunch of
[1:58:13] confusion then brother Brenham has to
[1:58:15] answer it four or five times the
[1:58:16] questions asked brother Brenham didn't
[1:58:18] you mean to say 7,000 instead of yeah
[1:58:21] yeah yeah ah man he says oh thy stupid
[1:58:25] servant yeah I said it just quickly just
[1:58:28] how many of you ever say things like
[1:58:29] that with your kids huh you tell your
[1:58:31] kids something I told you to go straight
[1:58:33] here I'm sitting at the dinner table I'm
[1:58:36] telling a story and uh Sandy will say
[1:58:39] well you said that wrong I never said it
[1:58:41] wrong I said thus and th so I look at my
[1:58:45] kids I appeal to the court of the kids
[1:58:47] at the table did I say it wrong yeah you
[1:58:50] did no I
[1:58:52] didn't okay okay I said it wrong but you
[1:58:55] know what I meant yeah but you still
[1:58:58] said it
[1:59:03] wrong my wife and I have those
[1:59:05] discussions all the time I said man I
[1:59:08] wish we had a recorder here all the just
[1:59:10] play it back by your own
[1:59:16] words
[1:59:17] so 19 65 proing proving his word now
[1:59:22] that's a big word
[1:59:24] predestinate but we all know that it's
[1:59:26] the truth we absolutely know that the
[1:59:29] infinite God predestinated all things by
[1:59:32] forn knowledge before the foundation of
[1:59:34] world even the lamb was slain and every
[1:59:38] name that would ever be on the book that
[1:59:41] was found on the book before the book
[1:59:44] was ever
[1:59:46] written and Jesus came to redeem those
[1:59:50] who were in the book in the Bible the
[1:59:52] lamb came from behind the curtain taking
[1:59:55] the book and opened the
[1:59:57] seals that it was sealed with and he
[1:59:59] come to claim all that he had redeemed
[2:00:02] the intercessor now an intercessor
[2:00:04] making intercession for those who has
[2:00:07] redeemed all those whose names was
[2:00:11] written on the Lamb's Book of
[2:00:14] Life is
[2:00:16] redeemed and only once at the end time
[2:00:19] now Lee there comes your name on the
[2:00:22] book talking to Lee
[2:00:23] Bale he says see it's Dr Le Ville
[2:00:27] sitting here he's grammaring the book of
[2:00:29] The Seven Church ages and the problem
[2:00:32] come up or the question about your name
[2:00:34] taking off the Lamb's Book of Life see
[2:00:37] it's puzzled a lot of
[2:00:39] ministers but wait until you get the
[2:00:41] book which book Seven Church ages you'll
[2:00:45] understand if you got any light in
[2:00:48] you
[2:00:49] it
[2:00:51] now you all know that the prophet
[2:00:53] preached the seven Church ages again in
[2:00:56] the revelation of Jesus Christ series
[2:00:59] 1960 right December of 60 through
[2:01:04] January of 61
[2:01:07] amen so he was having Lee Vil to
[2:01:10] condense it summarize it make it a
[2:01:13] book and there's no dispute that the
[2:01:16] seven Church age covers every major
[2:01:19] Doctrine in this message amen now let me
[2:01:25] show to you I got three more quotes here
[2:01:30] and it'll be good because we'll come out
[2:01:31] just perfect but I've got a whole
[2:01:33] another sermon I'm going to show you
[2:01:36] some real super quotes that'll put
[2:01:40] everything in its perspective because
[2:01:42] the answers are here amen it's an open
[2:01:45] book
[2:01:47] test the invisible Union of the bride of
[2:01:50] Christ he opened those seven mysteries
[2:01:52] in there that shows forth brings forth
[2:01:54] those things that's been hid since the
[2:01:57] foundation of the world might be
[2:01:58] revealed in the last days to the sons of
[2:02:01] God they brought that forth now before
[2:02:04] thy people that they see it there you
[2:02:07] know to this
[2:02:10] undenominational bride that's us
[2:02:14] undenominational bride musicians have
[2:02:17] you come
[2:02:20] there is your two
[2:02:23] books one of them is the Lamb's Book of
[2:02:26] Life yes your name is there your name on
[2:02:31] there is predestinated on
[2:02:35] there it can't
[2:02:38] go because you can go no more take that
[2:02:43] away than
[2:02:44] nothing see because it was for dained to
[2:02:47] be there right
[2:02:49] but the regular Book of
[2:02:52] Life can take that off at any
[2:02:58] time invisible Union of the bride of
[2:03:02] Christ there's your name on The Book of
[2:03:07] Life The Book of Life is the word of God
[2:03:11] because the word is God and God is the
[2:03:13] only thing that is
[2:03:16] life so your name was represented in the
[2:03:20] Bible before the Bible become the
[2:03:23] word
[2:03:25] wow here it is a prophet going back into
[2:03:28] Before Time began right
[2:03:31] amen our Bible
[2:03:34] begins in the beginning God created the
[2:03:37] Heaven and Earth guess what this Prophet
[2:03:39] did I'm going to
[2:03:42] go beyond the
[2:03:44] beginning before
[2:03:47] there before God became God yes I'm
[2:03:51] going to take you back into the very
[2:03:52] Mind Of
[2:03:53] God because a god is an object of
[2:03:57] worship and there was no one he began to
[2:04:00] create angels to worship him that's it
[2:04:03] he began to have thoughts I want to be a
[2:04:05] redeemer I want to be a
[2:04:07] savior I want to be a
[2:04:11] Healer he's got all these thoughts watch
[2:04:14] this where is he forming this where is
[2:04:18] the Woman's Place to
[2:04:21] form that which has been placed inside
[2:04:24] of her in her womb that which has been
[2:04:27] given to her to conceive she takes it so
[2:04:30] brother Brown said there is a womb to
[2:04:32] the spirit and there is a womb to the
[2:04:34] Natural and God in the womb of his mind
[2:04:38] Hallelujah began to conceive seed
[2:04:43] Lord he had all these
[2:04:47] thoughts but a thought
[2:04:50] unspoken remains a
[2:04:54] thought but when he said let there
[2:04:58] be there
[2:05:01] was he said when he said let there be
[2:05:03] light he said it made have been eons and
[2:05:06] eons of
[2:05:10] time and there was
[2:05:14] light I created the heavens and the
[2:05:17] Earth
[2:05:21] and there it
[2:05:23] was do you see what I'm
[2:05:28] [Music]
[2:05:31] saying works as Faith expressed
[2:05:35] 1965 this is my last
[2:05:38] quote the Baptists believ there were two
[2:05:41] separate
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:45] books and in one way it is is two
[2:05:49] separate
[2:05:50] books in another
[2:05:52] way it isn't two separate
[2:05:56] [Music]
[2:05:59] books keep reading
[2:06:01] man otherwise you're going to stop well
[2:06:04] I don't get it just keep
[2:06:08] reading there's only one real one book
[2:06:12] of
[2:06:12] [Music]
[2:06:15] life he talks about the germ and the
[2:06:17] wheat and he goes under the stock and
[2:06:19] the tassel I'm going to read to you the
[2:06:22] highlighted that's the one place it
[2:06:24] sounds like you can have your name taken
[2:06:27] off the Lamb's Book of Life in the other
[2:06:29] place you can't do it so that's where it
[2:06:33] is it's all in that great Revelation
[2:06:37] there which was made known during the
[2:06:40] time of the Seven
[2:06:44] Seals why is
[2:06:47] it how is it so some people can't
[2:06:50] believe
[2:06:51] it do you see where the seals
[2:06:54] [Music]
[2:06:56] become the place where brother Brenham
[2:07:01] said even the full truth of marriage and
[2:07:04] divorce came with the opening of the
[2:07:06] seals he said with the opening of the
[2:07:09] seals came the full truth of serpent SE
[2:07:12] that's
[2:07:13] right he preached those doctrines long
[2:07:17] before right
[2:07:19] but now with the opening of the
[2:07:24] seals I got some really good quotes I
[2:07:27] couldn't bring it all to you today
[2:07:29] because it would be too much on our
[2:07:31] plate and it would be too much reading
[2:07:33] and guess what my voice is almost
[2:07:36] gone so by God's grace we'll continue on
[2:07:40] with this cuz I tell you and if you miss
[2:07:43] the next sermon I think you'll miss a an
[2:07:46] integral part so make sure if you're a
[2:07:48] visitor and I don't tell people to come
[2:07:50] back and listen to my
[2:07:52] sermons but you'll need to do it on this
[2:07:55] one here because say what he said is
[2:07:59] that okay with you you still love
[2:08:03] [Music]
[2:08:05] me
[2:08:09] amen let's just bow our heads for a
[2:08:14] moment father
[2:08:17] God
[2:08:22] I know I am held
[2:08:26] responsible for every one of these
[2:08:28] people especially they that claim I am
[2:08:31] their
[2:08:33] Pastor so I am not trying to correct
[2:08:35] everybody out in the internet and all
[2:08:37] the ministers within the message no no
[2:08:42] no I'm just going to preach the truth as
[2:08:44] I see it to our people
[2:08:49] because I substantiate it through the
[2:08:52] word of God and through the message of
[2:08:55] the hour that there be no
[2:08:57] confusion because so much of the time
[2:09:00] father what is taught as a doctrinal
[2:09:03] truth later you find out it
[2:09:08] wasn't that's why we need to study to
[2:09:10] show ourselves approved a Workman that
[2:09:13] needeth not to be
[2:09:15] ashamed rightly dividing the word of
[2:09:18] Truth
[2:09:19] and we'll look into this father because
[2:09:21] I'm
[2:09:22] excited and I
[2:09:25] know that you gave us a
[2:09:28] key because you told us that the Book of
[2:09:31] Life Is there a difference between the
[2:09:33] book of life and the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:09:36] he said no they are one and the
[2:09:39] same but then he turns around and he
[2:09:41] said but there's another
[2:09:43] [Music]
[2:09:45] record he said that there is another
[2:09:47] record within the Book of
[2:09:50] [Music]
[2:09:52] Life there is an
[2:09:54] addendum it's called the
[2:09:57] Lamb's Book of
[2:10:01] Life so hidden within the Book of
[2:10:05] Life is an
[2:10:08] addendum is another
[2:10:11] record I pray Heavenly Father may it be
[2:10:14] so clear and evident to your people as

[2:10:20] commit this service and that
[2:10:23] one to you father that you'll take
[2:10:28] my poor way of bringing it all
[2:10:32] out but bring it to their understanding
[2:10:34] because the holy spirit will lead and
