Brother Roger Shar, would you come tonight? Brother Roger, take us to the Lord in prayer. Sister Tempe says, "We have an unspoken prayer request for our daughter Caitlyn." So, let's remember sister Caitlyn and Lord knows what her need is. Brother Amos had shoulder surgery today. Brother Steven heard from him just before we came out. Surgery went well. He's going to be in the hospital for the night. And just ask for a speedy recovery for Brother Amos. Pray the Lord just be with him. And let's remember, Brother Russell goes in for surgery on Friday. And we just pray the Lord be with Brother Russell. Amen. Sister Karen has turned in a note. She says, "Sister Sarah's asking prayer for her co-worker's dad. His name is Jose. He has prostate cancer, stage 4, and they're praying for God to intervene with a healing in his life, prolong his days." So, the Lord is more than able tonight. So, let's remember this gentleman named Jose. And whatever your need might be this evening, just lift before the Lord as Brother Roger come and pray for us. Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we just thank you, Lord, for another privilege and opportunity to be gathered together tonight in your name. Lord, we just ask that for your presence to come down, Lord, and touch every heart, Father. Touch every everyone, Lord, that has a need. And we all have needs, Lord Jesus. and the prayer requests I hold in my hand, Lord. You knew them before the foundation of the world, Lord Jesus. And we know for assurityity that you hear our prayers, Lord. So, we're asking you that you'd minister to every one of these needs, Lord Jesus. Touch each one, Lord. I pray. Thank you, Lord, for being with Brother Amos through his surgery this this afternoon or whenever it was, Lord. And we thank you for ministering to his need, Lord. May he have a speedy recovery, full recovery. Lord Jesus, in your name we pray. Thank you, Lord, for this service, Lord. May you have the preeminence. May you minister to all our needs tonight, Lord. And and may you have your way in every heart tonight. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Roger. You may be seated tonight. I want to welcome each one in the house of the Lord. For those of you streaming tonight, just a reminder, Sunday school starts up Sunday right after Labor Day be the 7th of September. And if you haven't yet completed one of the information forms for your children, please do that so we have some general information on who's in the classes. And if you could turn that into the deacons, be greatly appreciated. Amen. How many are happy tonight? &gt;&gt; Woke up this morning feeling fine. &gt;&gt; Had heaven on my mind all day and the more I look around, the more I want to go there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that tonight. I woke up this morning feeling fine. Oh, I woke up with heaven on my mind. I woke up with joy in my soul. For I knew that the Lord had control. I knew I was walking in the light. for I'd been on my knees in the night. I prayed till the Lord gave me sight. And now I'm feeling mighty fine. Oh yes, I'm feeling mighty fine. Oh, I've got heaven on my mind. You know, don't you know? I want to go to where the milk and honey flows. And there's a light that always shines down inside this heart of mine. Oh, I've got heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven on my mind. And now I'm feeling mighty fine. We're walking with Jesus all the time. We're walking and talking as we climb. We're traveling that road to the sky where I know I'll live if I die. And he's been telling me all about this land. And he tells me that everything is grand. And he says that a home will be mine. And now I'm feeling mighty fine. Oh yes, I'm feeling mighty fine. Oh, I've got heaven on my mind. know, don't you know? I want to go to where the milk and honey blows.

Shine through the shadows, burn like &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. With our heads and our hearts bowed, I would like to uh read a a late prayer request that came in. It says, "Please pray for my wife Miriam. Two months ago, she suffered a rare condition called a molar pregnancy. Doctors told us if the tumor grew back, they had a concern for cancer. Some tests indicated it's regrown or she has conceived. We are asking the prayers of the saints for the Lord be with her and touch her completely and give her peace during this time. Thank you, brother Corey Cook, let's just bow our heads together. Father God, &gt;&gt; your name is life. &gt;&gt; Your name is power. &gt;&gt; Your name Lord &gt;&gt; is the name above all names. And so, Father, we come to thee in thy precious name this evening, knowing, Lord, that all things are in thy hands. And we bring before you, our sister here, Miriam, Lord, and this pregnancy uh uh no doubt, Lord. It's it's kind of strange and they're in a a limbo of state and mind, not knowing what it is, Father. But you know, Lord, and so Father, I ask for a touch, Father, that you would touch her from the crown of her head to the soles of her feet. We pray that it is a conception and not a tumorous cancer, Lord. Father, we place the family in your hands, Lord. And let thy kingdom uh thy kingdom, Lord, and let thy glory be done in their lives, Father God. We present them to you now. And we ask that you would be with us this evening. Father, as we come and we are at this portion of this service, Father, you know what you've placed on my heart and you know the needs that's upon your people's hearts, Father. And I believe that both are connected, Lord, because you don't put a thought without a need, Lord. And so, Father, I pray this evening that your word would not return void, but it will accomplish, Lord, what it's designed to do. We'll give you all the praise and all the honor and all the glory for it only belongs unto thee. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask these favors. Amen. And amen. Well, thank you musicians. God bless you. God bless you this evening. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. And we welcome each and every one of you here into his presence. If you have your Bible, turn with me to the book of Luke, chapter 15, and uh we'll read verses 11 through 32. A very familiar portion of scripture for us because that was us at one time, &gt;&gt; the prodal son. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Luke chapter 15, we'll start at verse 11. And it reads, "And he said, a certain man had two sons. And the younger of them said to his father, father, give me the portion of goods that followleth me." And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotist living. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in the land, and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country. And he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat. and no man give unto him. And when he had came to himself, he said, "How many hired servants of my father's um have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger? I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and I'm no more worthy to be called thy son. Make me as one of thy hired servants." You see, he he came to a place where God could really deal with his heart. &gt;&gt; Uh and he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. And the son said unto him, "Father, I've sinned against heaven and in thy sight, and uh I'm no more worthy to be called thy son." But the father said to his servants, "Bring forth the best robe. Put it on him. Put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet, and bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and be merry. For this my son was dead, and is alive again. He was lost and is found, and they began to be merry." Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant. And they said unto him, "Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound." Wow. He should have been really thankful for his brother coming back into the house of the Lord. But he was angry, and he would not go in. Therefore, his father came out and entreated him. And he answering said to his father, "Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment, and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make Mary with my friends." But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf." And he said unto him, "Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine." It was meat that we should make merry and be glad. For this thy brother, he was dead &gt;&gt; and is alive again and was lost &gt;&gt; and is found. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may take your seat this evening. &gt;&gt; I would like to title my sermon this evening your identity. And we see here with um with this prodal um before he became a prodal and returned to his father, he knew exactly who he was. He had an identity. And the reason that we know that he knew who he was and he understood his identity is because he had an understanding of his inheritance that belonged unto him. Right. &gt;&gt; And so with identity, there comes a revelation of inheritance. &gt;&gt; And so that's why, you know, even on Sunday's service, I thought it was quite fascinating to to watch uh the the sermon unfold the way it did. And and these five these five women, they they they approached Moses and they approached God. And and the reason that they were approaching is because there was an inheritance that belonged unto them that was from their father. &gt;&gt; And so the reason that they knew there was an an inheritance was because they had an identity. &gt;&gt; Not only did they know who they were, but they knew who their father was. They knew the reputation that their father had. They knew the belongings and the and and the fields and and whatever it may have been that belonged to her to their fathers. And therefore they said, "Let it not perish or or go to someone else, but let it go to us because we we are still bone of his bone and we are flesh of his flesh." And therefore what is his, it should be ours also. And so when they came and they asked before before Moses and said uh give unto us our inheritance, they were not asking a miss. &gt;&gt; Let me say that when the bride of Jesus Christ catches her identity, when she asks something of her father, she is not asking a miss. When you're asking your father of something of your inheritance that you need in your life, you're not asking a miss. Why? Because you know what is his is also yours. His inheritance is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; So here he was, he had an identity. He never had an identity crisis, but he knew who he was. He knew what belonged to him. &gt;&gt; But yet he had his eyes on the wrong things. Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; And so later on in the service, I'll I'll read a few portions out of uh spiritual amnesia because we see that that uh that sons and daughters of God, they can get amnesia in their lives and they can forget who they are. &gt;&gt; They might at one time in their life have a revelation of being sons and daughters of God, of of recognizing an inheritance that belongs to them. But when we get our eyes off of the main thing, we can become blinded to the word by the world. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's only one letter of difference. &gt;&gt; We should be blinded to the world by the word. &gt;&gt; But so much of the time we become blinded to the word by the world. &gt;&gt; I say, Father, keep our eyes on things above. Keep our eyes on our inheritance. keep our eyes upon the word and not the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In 1964, brother Brandham says in the sermon identification, if you notice, if you go to a certain denominational church like a Methodist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, or something, you have to have something to identify yourself. If you're going to speak, you have to have a credential or a card or a fellowship card or something to identify yourself as where they know where you come from and what you're going to say at that platform. You have to be identified and it's an identifying age. &gt;&gt; Notice that whenever brother Brandon was first speaking this back in 1964, he says this is an identifying age. &gt;&gt; No doubt. I'm sure perhaps he looked into the future of Leodysia and he saw that towards the end of the age here we would be living in such a time where people would have a problem with identifications. They would have an issue of identity, not knowing who they are, not knowing who their parents are, not knowing the inheritance that is left to them, not knowing if they're a boy or a girl &gt;&gt; or a cat or a mouse &gt;&gt; or a dog. &gt;&gt; It's an identifying age. &gt;&gt; People not understanding their true identity. &gt;&gt; Amen. not understanding what they are if they're some kind of animal or if they're a human being. What would make somebody begin to um let me say the word dab or dabble would be the right word to dabble in such things as as as as a cat and a mouse and and a and a change of sex and all these things that for us it just absolutely blows our mind. What would make them dabble in that and and and and and and try to see if that's who they really are? &gt;&gt; It's because they don't know who they are. &gt;&gt; They have no identity in who they are. And so they're trying to become something else to try and find something that they can relate to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that our identity only comes from Christ. &gt;&gt; It only comes from God and God's word. And so our identity actually comes from the male. &gt;&gt; It does not come from the female. &gt;&gt; Let me finish the rest of this this uh this quote here. Now all that happens in the natural. Now brother Brandham is talking about the natural and he's going to type it to the spiritual is only a type what's going on in the spiritual. We also the Christian church itself which is of no denomination but of a nature. It is the mystical body of Christ. Notice it's by nature and not by name. &gt;&gt; So much of the time we get caught up by name by the name of the church by the name of the denomination. Understand the denomination is the woman. &gt;&gt; And so it's not the name but it's the nature. It is the mystical body of Christ and it's identified also. It bears identification. Jesus identified himself. And now we're going to speak the this afternoon upon identification in the Bible character. We are uh to identify our present condition and with characters of the Bible of other ages. So in other words, we need to identify ourselves within the scriptures. And in order to identify yourself within the scripture, you got to read the scriptures. &gt;&gt; You got to be a Bible believer. You got to be a Bible reader to understand to see yourself within the scriptures. So, let me let me provoke you to good works this evening. Get into your Bible. Read your Bible. Spend a little bit of time in your Bible reading it to see which characters within this word that you can relate to and identify yourself with. So much of the time we can identify with with with Ruth or we identify with uh the story of Boaz and Esther and and the more you read your Bibles, the more that you begin to identify yourself with certain characters within the word. &gt;&gt; But let me say this, it is not enough just to identify yourself with, let me just say, with with with the the lion anointing. The lion anointing is good and we are identified with it, but we can't stop there. &gt;&gt; It's good to be identified with the ox and the the uh and carrying other people's burdens and and it's a burden carrier and a burden bearer and it's good to carry each other's burdens, but we can't stop there. &gt;&gt; It's good to have the the intellects of a man anointing within our lives. It's it's good to identify with that, but we can't stop there. The bride of Christ continues on to this last anointing upon this age, which is the eagle anointing. If you don't get caught up with the eagle anointing, you'll be stuck in the man anointing. And if you're stuck in the man anointing, you'll see the man and not the lamb. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the eagle anointing takes us up higher. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5, he says, "Come on up here, John. &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you these things. I'm going to reveal myself to you of this great plan of redemption. And John found himself as a type of the bride under the eagle anointing caught up into the heavens. &gt;&gt; And what was it that caught him up to the heavens? It was the anointing. &gt;&gt; And what was it that was in the heavens? There was a lamb &gt;&gt; that had been slain since before the foundations of the world. &gt;&gt; So what does the anointing of this hour do? The anointing of this hour takes us off of man-made creeds and ideas and it brings us up a little bit higher into the presence of the lamb and not the man. &gt;&gt; So when you miss the eagle anointing, when you miss the revealing of the word for the day and hour in which we're living in, you're under the anointing of a man and not the lamb or the eagle. What is so good about that, brother Stephen? You ever wonder about an eagle? An eagle uses the wind to his advantage. &gt;&gt; Whereas a lion doesn't like wind. &gt;&gt; You ever see animals? You ever try to go hunt deer in the wind? &gt;&gt; Good luck. &gt;&gt; They're hidden. They're hiding. Why? They don't like the wind. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do any of you like going out and walking in the wind &gt;&gt; when it's super windy up in Flagstaff on top of the mountain? Said, "Nobody." &gt;&gt; Chapped lips galore, man. &gt;&gt; None of us like the wind. But the eagle takes the same wind that the man anointing looks at and and and the ox and the lion and and these earthbound anointings. And the line the the eagle takes the same wind that affects these earthbound creatures and it uses it to its advantage. &gt;&gt; And so now our whenever we look at the the uh the winds of life and the trials and tribulations and the things that that that bombard us on a on a daily basis, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Have you have you got trials and temptations and issues and things that you face? Sure you do. But now under this eagle anointing, we can say that all things work together for good. &gt;&gt; We can say, "I may not like or enjoy this, but I'm going to use it for my benefit because I know that God is doing it for my good." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen, sir. &gt;&gt; We've got to identify ourselves &gt;&gt; with the word of the hour. &gt;&gt; And by identifying ourselves with the word, it is made flesh and made manifested. There's a quote where cuz I believe that whatever you identify with your life is going to prove it. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And you can only identify with what's in your heart. &gt;&gt; So sometimes we need a change of heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham says uh in the sermon spiritual amnesia, we are identified with our families in this human life by marriage and with our wives. We marry and our families identified by the union of our marriage. So now, brother Brham is taking the natural and he's saying that we as human beings that are that are living our lives, we are identified as humans by who we marry, the family that we have, and the family that we produce. We are identified by our union and by our marriage. Not only are we identified by our union and marriage and and our children and so on and our and our parents and everything but we are identified uh we have an identification according to where we grew up. &gt;&gt; We have an identification according to the part of the world that we grew up in. &gt;&gt; Amen. the part of the country in that that say it was in the north of a certain country that is part of your identity. &gt;&gt; It is a part of who you are. It is a part of what makes you as a human. &gt;&gt; It makes up your nature because it makes your nature is your identity. Amen. So according to the place where we were raised, the families that we were raised under, how our grandpa was, how our great grandpa was and on down the line, we understand that according to our union and the people that are surrounding us in our lives, no matter where it is upon the world, it is part of our uh makeup, our nature and our identity and what makes us us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Take somebody from the south for instance, uh um from wherever, a country person. Go talk to him for a while. Well, let me tell you something. It sure is a nice day today. And us in the city, we're like, "Yeah, it is. It's a wonderful day." Come on. Let's speed the story up a little bit. What is it that can make two people from the same country completely different? &gt;&gt; It's according to where they're raised. &gt;&gt; When I was in Australia, it was pretty awesome. Those people there are so relaxed, man. So laid-back. And I thought, "Wow, this is pretty amazing." So when I go to other camps and minister at other camps, I'm checking to see uh how they run it and and and and all that because I'm comparing apples to apples, you know, and um and so I'm over there and I'm thinking, "Wow, these people are sure are laid-back like us, you know, service starts at 7. Song service starts at this time. People, you better be here at this time and you better be seated and this and that." And we're so uptight. Let's just be real. We're so uptight that everything must run according to the time. And if it doesn't, it's the end of the world. That's just how we are. And and I'll say this, you can you can take this out of the the streaming, okay? I think we run a really good camp. Like everything runs very very very well. Okay. The organization part of it, it really does. So, we're over there and uh the my first first night I was going to preach and and brother Daniel, he texts me. He says they call each other bro. Hey, bro. He text me. He says, "Hey, bro. We're 30 minutes late." Okay, great. So, I got an extra 30 minutes late. Hey, bro. 45 minutes. And all of a sudden, and so I'm like, "Well, might as well just go up there and sit and see what's going on." And uh and so I go up there and I start talking to people like, "Hey, what's going on here? Like, why aren't why aren't you ready?" And and why is this? He goes, "Hey, bro. We got nowhere else to go. What are you so uptight about?" I said, "Okay, that's fair." And they just roll with it. And they're so laidback. And and so after everything was over and they're driving me to the airport, I said, "You know what, Brother Daniel? You guys are so laidback, man. This is great. I'm going to take the Australian spirit back to the US with me. I'm just gonna relax and and and just chill out, man. So, we're driving on the freeway and uh this is I just got done saying this. Just got done. And all of a sudden, there's two cars in front of us in this low lane and we're doing 65 kilometers, which is like 45 miles per hour. I'm What are they doing, man? I said, "Brother Daniel, aren't you going to pass these folks like 45 miles per hour in the freeway?" He says, "Brother Steve, I thought you were going to relax and take the spirit of Australia back with you." I said, "I'm already home in my mind. I'm sorry, man. &gt;&gt; We're all humans. &gt;&gt; But yet, according to where we were brought up, according to our family and our culture and everything of it, it makes us all different. &gt;&gt; Therefore, we have different natures and therefore we identify with things differently." &gt;&gt; Yes. So our identities it is it is made up of all those different things but our true identity as as as as humans not even in the spiritual realm yet it comes from the father and I can use scripturally because in our in our opening scripture there when the prodal came back mom didn't run out to see him mom didn't run out and say, "Hey, give him the robe. Give him the ring. Give him this. Kill the fatted calf. Do this, that, and the other." Everybody, "Hey, my son is home. Praise the Lord." No, it was the dad. &gt;&gt; Whenever it came time for adoption, it wasn't mom who adopted the kids. It was dad. &gt;&gt; And so it is with us within this life that we live. Mom doesn't bring us to adoption, but dad does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's only certain ways and certain places that dad can take us to as we're growing up what mom can't take care of. &gt;&gt; And so what happens is is that we people that are um that have an absentee father, they they have no identity in the natural. So that's why you can look at you can look at the news and you can look at life and everything that's going on this past five, six years, whatever it is, and you see the people trying to be transgenders and this one trying to be this and this one trying to be that and and foxes and cats and so on and so forth. And you wonder to yourself, what is going on? What is happening? Why are they doing it? It's because we have a fatherless society. &gt;&gt; And only dad can give us our true identity. And if dad is not home, if dad is not present, if dad is absent, we have no identity and we look for it in other places. &gt;&gt; So that's why a young man can be can be raised up in a home and all of a sudden dad is not there and little little Jimmy ends up in a gang. &gt;&gt; Why does Jimmy end up in a gang? Because dad isn't around. &gt;&gt; He needs to get his identity from somewhere. And so he goes out and he gets it from other places. Why does why does Sally go out and and and and and give her body to whoever whoever desires it? It's because of the need of attention that she's not getting from dad at home cuz she's trying to find her identity in another male instead of her dad. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we can see there's there's a real problem with &gt;&gt; not only identity, identity uh people not understanding their identity is is a byproduct of a fatherless society. It is a byproduct of dad not being home, of dad not being around, and of dad not taking care of business like he should be. &gt;&gt; Let me let me read this to you. This is pretty fascinating because I I I looked up about a a fatherless society in the statistics and and different things. And this is very enlightening. And you're going to say, "Well, you're just talking about the uh a one family home." I'm not. Because there's many times that dad is at home and there's a union between mom and dad and there's a family, but dad is absent &gt;&gt; even when he's present. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I feel like it's not not only has it Satan doesn't care about it in the world, but he wants it to creep in &gt;&gt; to the church. &gt;&gt; And he wants it to creep in to our to our lives and to our homes that just as he doesn't care if mom and dad are there as long as he can get dad to be absent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; He knows that the identity crisis will continue even when dad is there. And here's the thing about it, saints. We've all been absent. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; As fathers. &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. &gt;&gt; We've all been there, but we're not there. &gt;&gt; We've all been there, but somewhere else in our mind. And and and and and I'm wanting to provoke you onto good works and to recognize it and to realize it and to pay attention like the like the prodical son. He came to himself. I agree. &gt;&gt; We need our our our husbands and our fathers at home &gt;&gt; to come to ourselves &gt;&gt; and to realize I'm present but I'm absent. &gt;&gt; I'm both at the same time. The lights are on but no one is home. &gt;&gt; And when no one is home, mom is the one that's taking care of business. And when mom is taking care of everything, she's out of her place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because now mom has to do the job of dad because dad is absent. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Let's read this. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's not it. I won't read it all, but I'll read some of it. 63% of youth of youth suicides are from fatherless homes. 90% of all homeless and runaway children 90% of homeless and runaway children are from fatherless homes. 85% of all children who show behavior disorders come from fatherless homes. 80% of rapists with anger problems come from fatherless homes. 71% of all high school dropouts come from fatherless homes. Children with fathers who are involved are 40% less likely to repeat a grade in school. Children with fathers are invol childrens with fathers who are involved are 70% less likely to drop out of school. Children with fathers who are involved are more likely to get A's in school. So much of the time you can look at your kids and say, "What's wrong with your grades?" I'll tell you what's wrong with my grades. &gt;&gt; You're not present. &gt;&gt; Hope not. &gt;&gt; What was that statistic? children with fathers. There was no percentage on it. But we can look and we can blame the child and we can blame the young adult and we can blame the one who was in college who's always changing their major and always running around and dropping out over here and trying this and trying that and we can blame and say, "Hey, you need to get your act together." But yet, dad, are you present? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know. &gt;&gt; Dad, are you there? Because children with dads involved in their in their educational curriculum, when they're involved, they are more likely to get A's. We went to the little uh uh meet the teacher deal, you know, when you got a bunch of kids in school, it's like it never ends. And so we went and had Miles's chair is right up front. I'm like, good grief, man. sit up front and sitting on his chair and everything. And uh and and and in school, you know, I disliked school and I still dislike it sitting there for longer than 20 minutes. I'm ready to leave. I can't stand it. Super nice teacher. Really liked her, but it's just something about it. So anyways, there's a little slip that you fill out and everything. And um and what are your hopes, you know, for Miles? What is he good at? and all this all these things and and I was trying so hard not to brag, you know, and and so I wrote some things and and it said uh uh what what do you expect out of, you know, your child this year? What would you like them to get? And I wrote get all A's. So what does that mean? That means I got to be present. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got to be a part of it. &gt;&gt; I got to be there. I got to be involved because if I'm not, it's not all his fault. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Though he's talented and though he's smart and though, you know, I'm trying not to brag, but he's a good kid. Trying not to brag. I got good kids. They're smart. They take after their mommy, not after their daddy. But if I want him, if I want, if I want the outcome, I've got to help them reach the outcome. Because if I don't and I expect it, guess what? There's something evil in my heart. &gt;&gt; Because I'm expecting something that I'm not providing away with. And God doesn't do that. And therefore, we should not do that to our children, to our spouses, to one another. &gt;&gt; This is fascinating. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um 43% of US children live without their father. It's almost half. 71% of pregnant teenagers lack a father. 63% of youth suicides are from fatherless homes. 75% of adoles adolescent patients in chemical abuse centers come from fatherless homes. 85% of youth in prison grew up in a fatherless home. I think you see the picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is doom &gt;&gt; and it is gloom. And why are these things happening? Because of all of these all of these children that are that are going through these things. Understand there's no correct headship. And without the correct headship from dad, there is no identity. Therefore, they're going to chase their identity from other things and other ways and other places that we shouldn't be going or go or doing or or hanging out with. &gt;&gt; Why? Because of an absent father. I wonder how many of us within the message as fathers and as husbands, we're there. We're at home and we're providing for our families and we're working hard and and we're doing all these things and and and we're doing everything else, but yet the kids and mom are left to themselves. Mom makes the dinner, does the dishes, get takes care of the kids, and but where's dad? &gt;&gt; Where are we? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I put myself in it. Where are we? Where am I? Where are you? &gt;&gt; Are you present? Are you a a very present help in a time of need? &gt;&gt; Just like your heavenly father. How many times do we say that about our heavenly father? Oh, he's such a good God and he's always there for me and he's a very present help in a time of need. But when it comes to us being father to our children, no matter what the age may be, &gt;&gt; I wonder are we a very present &gt;&gt; help? &gt;&gt; I wonder are we there? Are we present? Are we in the moment? Or are we doing something else? Are we on our phones? Are we doing something in our mind? or you know are are we whatever it may be I don't want to give I don't need to do that you know you &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; you know your life I know my life I know at certain times where where you know let let me be very transparent love transparency I remember sometimes I'll get home and I'll lay on the couch and it just feels real good just to lay on the couch relax. This is my time. I'm just going to relax. And kids are old enough now where they can do their thing. And you know, and Mariah's so good with the little baby and everything. Oh, yeah. Everything's golden. And I got a flashback of when I was a kid. And And this wasn't I got two memories actually that I completely forgot about. The one went way back when my grandpa was still alive. And we would my my my grandma lived right across the street from us like 100 yards uh right across the street. So we would go over there every Sunday and she would make some good roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, gravy, you know, just a real good hearty Irish meal. And we would go over there and my grandpa was always laying on the couch. Always not doing a thing. Just laying there watching TV. Everybody else is busy doing stuff. I thought, "Wow, that was my grandpa. on my mom's side. Well, I don't want to be like him. I wasn't a very good guy. When my grandpa died, very transparent. You want to know something? Dirty laundry. My mom's side of the family. Don't tell anybody, okay? Don't tell my mom I preached either. She'll watch this. He had a He when he died, they found out he had a he had a whole another family. He had two families at once. As if one wasn't enough. Any wonder he was laying on the couch. Soon I got another thought, another memory of my dad. Now it's closer to home. My my identity. My dad gives me my identity. And my dad was such a hard worker. Always always worked two jobs and and everything. and he come home, drink a beer and sit on the couch, fall asleep. And I thought, what am I turning into now? I'm really hard on myself, right? Cuz when I share it to my wife, she's like, "No, you do lots of stuff. You're good." And I'm like, I don't think so. &gt;&gt; Like, I'm present, but I'm absent. I'm here, but I'm not here. It's like I'm I'm here, but I'm of no value. Do I really want to get my identity from the bad parts, the hindered parts of my family where I'm doing the exact same thing or do I want to change? And I believe God is the one that showed that to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That showed me what I was doing and where I got it from. And so now the ball is in my court. Now yours might not be laying on the couch. But I'm sure there's other attributes in your life, of your nature, of your upbringing that you would say, "My goodness, I reacted just like my dad. I I reacted over here just like this person, and I'm turning into this. Oh my." But now, when you notice it, now we have a choice. And this goes for girls and boys alike, okay? Goes for men and women, young and old. Now, we have a choice where we're like, well, do I really like this attribute of my family member or do I dislike it? Is it a good attribute or is it bad? And if we're honest with ourselves and we say, well, this attribute is really bad. I don't want to be like them and their and and and the things that I disliked. Now, it's up to us to change it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Now we have a choice because why should we walk in the footsteps of our forefathers that went before us that we don't like where they walked or what they did? &gt;&gt; It's complete insanity. &gt;&gt; So now each and every one of us, we have this choice where we're like, I like this, but I don't like this. And I see certain aspects of my life going in this way. I choose today to put a stake in the ground that I don't want to go in this direction. I'm going to go in this other direction. And you go to God through prayer and say, "Father, help me. &gt;&gt; Help me in my life. Help me in the direction in which I'm going, the things that I'm thinking, my outbursts, whatever it is that you deal with in your life that has been passed down to you from your family. If you don't like it, you don't got to stay there." Right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And if you don't like it, stop using it as an excuse. &gt;&gt; Real down home, huh? &gt;&gt; It's good stuff, isn't it? &gt;&gt; It hits home, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; It hits home for me, too. &gt;&gt; And so now we have this struggle within ourselves, and it's a battle that we must fight. And it's a battle that we can win when we put God first. So we see that our our identity as as young people, it comes from our fathers. Fathers, it comes from fathers, comes from dad. It doesn't come from mom, comes from the male. It doesn't come from female. It comes from the word. It doesn't come from the church. It doesn't come from the female. &gt;&gt; Our identity is not in a church. &gt;&gt; Our identity is not in a pastor or a preacher. &gt;&gt; And a pastor or a preacher shouldn't be bringing the people onto themselves, but pointing to Christ. &gt;&gt; Because that's what the woman does. There's certain things in her life that that that she cannot handle that she needs dad to take care of. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you ever had your wife tell you, "You need to deal with this?" Sure you have. All of us have heard it. Do you know why mama is saying that? &gt;&gt; Because she is not designed to handle it. &gt;&gt; It's just a fact. So if she's not designed to handle it as the female and it and it's it certain thing boils certain things boils down to correction. There are certain things in our lives as as as as parents that that a woman can't correct her children as dad does. It's completely different. &gt;&gt; Now follow me with this thought. When mom tries to take the place of dad to correct the kids and I'm talking through experience also. When mom tries to take the place of dad to correct the kids because she has to do it because dad is absent and not present, it hardens the spirit. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Because she's not designed to handle that part of it. The correction comes from the male. Our correction comes from the word. It comes from God. Amen. &gt;&gt; It says, "Those who I love, I rebuke and I chasen." &gt;&gt; God is the one who does the rebuking and the chastening. But when mom is always doing it, guess what happens? Her spirit gets hardened. Now, so let's bring it down to a church. What happens if there's a church which is type of the woman, which is female in nature? What happens if she's always balling out the church and and and always correcting the people and always having to give the five-fold ministry and there's not a balanced ministry coming from behind the pulpit for the people, the church becomes hardened, &gt;&gt; the preacher becomes hardened, &gt;&gt; the pastor becomes hardened. Why? Why does his spirit get so hardened? And there's no correction out of love because his spirit is hardened because he's trying to do the correction and not bringing it through the word which is the male. &gt;&gt; Now that's not to say that mom doesn't correct the youngans. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? But when it gets out of balance, &gt;&gt; when it gets out of balance in our home lives, when it gets out of balance within our church life or whatever church it may be, I don't know, but it becomes the church then becomes hardened and the pastor becomes hardened because he's he's out of his place with the correction. And so that's where I have to be very careful even with preaching this tonight because number one, I'm not the pastor. And I was battling back here. &gt;&gt; I'm thinking, man, I could just preach God or coincidence or I could just change it real quick. I got all these different sermons. And I was battling because I realized, hey son, you ain't the pastor. What are you doing preaching a sermon like this? And I realized that that the more that Satan was fighting me in my mind and in my heart, the more I realized I needed to preach it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; But the more that I realized that it has to come in love. &gt;&gt; It has to come with the right spirit. So it's it's it's just like it's just like this. Say we have a family member or any of you guys see my kids acting um disorderly out here and where what they shouldn't be doing and you say, "Hey, knock it off. Knock it off." Hey, good. Thank you. Tell them to knock it off. They shouldn't be doing that. It's dangerous. Whatever the whatever it may be. But whenever you come to, you know, physical correction, well, now it's not taken the same way. Why? because it's my kids. But knock it off. It's fine. So tonight it's just a little knock it off. Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm preaching to myself just as much. &gt;&gt; Trust me. &gt;&gt; Trust me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But it's but it's something that I feel that is is that us as fathers and us as husbands and whatever it may be, we need to be um aware &gt;&gt; of where we're at. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we need to be aware of when we're absent that we might get back in present again because we are only helpful when we are present. &gt;&gt; We are only helpful when we are in the now. &gt;&gt; And if we're there and we're not there, we're not helping. And then that's why God gave us a family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My So in the sermon, a paradox. This is a pretty lengthy quote, so just bear with me. But for instance, a few days ago, I was called in on a scene or on a little something going on. There was a fine a fine young man, very fine boy. He was going with a little girl, very fine little girl out of a fine family. notice everything's fine, huh? Fine boys, fine girl, fine families. And this boy all of a sudden came up with some kind of an idea and he just walked away. &gt;&gt; He did something wrong to the little girl as much as promised her to do a certain thing and then didn't do it. And instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do. So what do gentlemen do? &gt;&gt; Got it. It just wasn't in him to do it. And the father and mother called me to the scene and said, "We would desire to know what is wrong with our boy." Now, it's not easy to do sometimes, but you must be truthful and honest. The boy was a Christian as far as a believer. He had repented, had been baptized, and had his position among the believers, but yet he had not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, no matter how much he thought he had. You thinking you had and having it is two different things. &gt;&gt; You might be able to try to say you have, you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion, but unless your life is vindicating what you're professing to have, you still haven't got it. No matter how many emotions, how much you jump around sensation, speaking in tongues, shouting, or whatever might lay it upon, which is all right. I believe in all that, too. But unless your life copes with your testimony, then you haven't got it. because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells what it is. Jesus said by the fruit you shall know them. Now this young fell's parents his mother is German. No reflection on the German but there's a strain in that family. And that is they'll just sit and you can talk to them and they'll just they'll just stare you right in the face. They got it. this girl's sister, the mother of this boy. I I have come down the street many a morning and this young lady be sitting out in the yard and I'd say good morning to you and she'd just look at me and I'd stop and I'd say sure fine morning. She'd just stand look at you. An intelligent woman and I'd say come up to see us sometime. She'd just stand and look. Well, her brothers are that way. Father and mother's that way. So notice there's a strain in the family that the father's that way. The mother's that way, the kids are that way, and no doubt the grandpa was that way, and no doubt you could take this strain on down the family line. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To where they were all just really odd is how I would put it. Like if I spoke to someone and they didn't talk back, I would say, "That person is odd." Okay? They were odd. There was a strain in their family that was passed down through generations. A strainness of oddness. I think we all have a little oddness in us here. you know, one way or another that has been passed down to us that we just can't get rid of. And so here they were and and um father and mother's that way. Now, the father of the boy is strictly an Irishman. Here we go. Should I have someone else read it or should I read it? Moody, high-tempered, highrung. That's his whole family like that. except one out of the family converted. &gt;&gt; So us converted Irishman, we're not moody highrung or anything like that anymore. You can just you could just relax. This father and mother both are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost and they have brought this young man up in the way of the Lord. And now the young man is about 17 or 18 years old, something along there. Very fine kid. And he's been a real a real model at boy at home. Nice kid. and he's got a brother that's just vice versa. The mother's family lives close to a fine church, but do you think they'll ever come over there? No. They know it's right, but it's just not in them to ask for forgiveness or ask pardoning, they just won't do it. It's just not in them. Now, the genes in the father and the mother of this boy, no matter how much they're converted, notice, no matter how much the family of the the parents of the children are converted, still remains the flesh that's been interbred out to this boy. So, it doesn't matter how much of the Holy Ghost mom or dad does, guess what? The strain is going to be passed along the bloodline uh by the by the seed of the male and it's going to come into the boy. And until he gets converted, filled with the Holy Ghost himself, he's going to deal with the issues and the strain of the family. &gt;&gt; And I'll say this, even with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, there will still be a fight because it's a part of the person's nature. But now if you got the nature of God and you got this strain of a of a of a family issue in our lives, now we can fight against it because greater is he &gt;&gt; that is in you than he who is in the world. &gt;&gt; So there's hope. &gt;&gt; He says from his mother's family and they're not forgiving, they'll not apologize. And that's where the boy stands. Now he said to the father, "No matter how much you've raised him up, now look, look at you out of your family, out of them drunks and fighting and shooting and cutting and so forth. Now look at your family to the mother. They're a bunch of people that just sit there and won't speak. Very independent and so forth. Uh irre irreverent to religion. It's not you. You're the only one out of your sisters and brothers and you're sweet, kind, and forgiving. What does it see? You're tree part of that family tree. You're a part of that family tree. Yet you have received the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's the thing that made you tender and sweet. It's not your people anymore. I like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's your Christ that lives in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; In order for Christ to live in us, we've got to yield our members to Christ that he might live through us. But if we yield ourselves to our carnal nature, that's the one that's going to live his life through us. &gt;&gt; I say, "Father, help us." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not your people anymore. It's your Christ in you. I said to the boy, "Look at your family. Practically all of them drunks and so forth." I said, "And how moody and high-tempered and high strong, but you're not. You're kind, forgiving." What is it? The Holy Spirit. You're no more what you are. It's Christ in you. Now, that same thing has to happen to your son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the father raised up and said, "My son went to the altar. He was baptized correctly in the name of Jesus Christ in water baptism in the pool. I said, I know your son has come to Christ. That may be all right. all the outward emotions. He might be identified as a believer with the believers, but until he's regenerated, born again, I'd advise that young man to never marry a woman. &gt;&gt; He'll make hell on earth for her until that gentle, sweet, forgiving spirit of Christ comes in. &gt;&gt; Then that will be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother. And yet in his intellectuals, he's trying his best to overcome it. He can't do it. He'll never overcome it. Christ will have to overcome it. When he lets Christ in and he's already overcome, then it'll be a perfect paradox when a man is born of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Talk about a mouthful. So here was these not to go over the whole thing, but I want to I want you to put yourself in the story &gt;&gt; and I want you to think of where you've been raised from &gt;&gt; from your family traits from mom and from dad and and the trait here and and and and this was past. People will say, "Well, have you ever heard the expression you you skipped a generation? You're uh uh you're you're not like your dad, but you're like your grandfather. You ever heard someone say that? They say you got traits of so and so down the family line. Why is that? Because that because that family line, there's a family tree that just continues on down. &gt;&gt; And so there's been ways that you and I have been raised uh according to where we we were raised from and according to how our parents were raised and and on and on and on. And it all makes up this identity of who we think we are. And and this is the paradox for me. This part it it this is a paradox is like God uses some of it and in others of it he wants crucified on a daily basis. &gt;&gt; So we can say brother Brandham was a fighter. He was an Irishman. He had the fighting Irish in his blood. And and here he was he he was he was a boxer, a professional boxer. And he just had that fight in him. He wouldn't quit. And so we we've been told time and time again that that God converted him, but he never took the fight out of him. That was part of his nature of where he was from as an Irishman. So God took that, but he just channeled it in a different direction. But there's other parts of Brother Brandham's nature that God wanted crucified on a daily basis. And so God does things with us as well that he he he watch brother Brandham said he watches our grandfather's great-grandfather and this and that and it's like a ping-pong ball and it comes down and down and down and all of a sudden the penny drops and here you come. And so God now takes a little bit of each and every one of these people that makes up who you are as a human being. And there's parts of it that he wants to use to channel in the right direction. &gt;&gt; And then there's other parts of it that he wants crucified on a daily basis. Yet it's still part of who we are and our nature. &gt;&gt; It's an absolute paradox. &gt;&gt; But I want to say this that it's not up to us to decide what stays and what goes. M good. &gt;&gt; We need to stay under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and say, "Father, reveal to me is this good or is this bad?" &gt;&gt; Because if I have good and bad here and I draw a line and I write whatever it is and I and and I this is good, this is bad, this is good, this is bad. Well, I don't want to keep the bad. I want to get rid of it. And so I say, Father, reveal to us and let our spirits be tender that when you speak to us about something of our inner being and of our nature and who we are that you're not happy with, I say, "Father, take it. &gt;&gt; I give it to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help me to overcome it." In this family, it was forgiveness and apologizing, holding grudges. In your family, it might be something different. I don't know. Something different in my family. But we've all got we've all got these things that these strains. &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. &gt;&gt; That hover over us that aren't supposed to just stay. They're supposed to go. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; We're to use spiritual discernment on our own selves. Not just on other people and situations, but on our own selves. Spiritual discernment to recognize when something is good and when something is bad. If something belongs and something cannot be used of God. &gt;&gt; And we as sons and daughters of God have to yield ourselves to that presence. And let me tell you something, it's not easy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's not fun. And it's not good for us to go through. But we've got to &gt;&gt; we've got to work on ourselves. We've got to recognize when when there's a trait in our lives that shouldn't be there that we don't just we don't just ignore it and say, "Well, it's just my nature." &gt;&gt; You see, that's the problem. It's just your nature. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And so, we can't use that as an excuse to be rude and not talk to people and not to apologize and to have this strain. Well, it's how my family was and this is just how I nonsense. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that is immature. &gt;&gt; But we are supposed to take the sword of the word and maturity as the bride of Jesus Christ and say, "Father, this don't belong here." &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to fight it. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; I'm going to fight this family trait that acts in this way. When this happens, I'm going to fight against this family trait of of of the battle of my mind. And I'm going to fight it. And I might lose some battles, but I'm gonna keep fighting by the sword of the word. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We need fathers to be present &gt;&gt; in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, and some of you might say, "Well, I wasn't I was never raised in a in a Christian home or going to church, but I have a father in the gospel. who led me to the Lord. And I get so choked up every time I think about him and talk about him. My my earthly father wasn't a believer and it wasn't his fault. But guess what? He's a believer now. And so is my mom. God just had a different plan for me. But we all have a a spiritual father. We all have someone that was a father figure in our lives that that led us to the truth and that kept that that that that that taught us &gt;&gt; that taught us discipline that taught us consistency that that taught that taught us to press on. And so we're all without excuse. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to get you to a place tonight where there's no more excuses. &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yep. Because Satan wants to give us excuses in our lives, but there's no more excuses. &gt;&gt; We should be above excuses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your identity doesn't come from the church. It doesn't come from mama, but it comes from the male. too much of the time as message believers, our identities in the church, &gt;&gt; my church, &gt;&gt; our music, our pastor, &gt;&gt; our youth group, our this. And all of a sudden, you have little you have little tussles between churches. Do you know why you have them? Is because people's identity is in the church and not in the word and God. Y &gt;&gt; the issue with church battling and fightings and and stuff like that is because our identity has been stolen from us as sons and daughters of God in the word of God into a church into the woman. &gt;&gt; And that's not where we find our identity. It's not in the woman. It's in the male. It's in the word. It's in God. We can look at at at Rebecca and Jacob, and I've been wrestling with this thought all day because it's not a it's not a perfect thought, but it's halfway there, so I'm going to use it anyways. You know, Rebecca couldn't um couldn't give uh Jacob the blessing. &gt;&gt; She couldn't. &gt;&gt; It wasn't hers to give. She was the woman. &gt;&gt; The blessing had to come from Isaac. &gt;&gt; And so what did the church do? &gt;&gt; She she yes, she deceived him, but she helped Jacob receive the blessing. The birthright was already his cuz God had already spoke it. But Esau had already given it to Jacob for a mess of pottage. He didn't really care about it. He didn't really care about the word about his inheritance. The only time he cared about his inheritance is when he came to get it. &gt;&gt; All Esau cared about, this is so good. All Esau cared about was the blessings. &gt;&gt; All Jacob cared about was the blessing of the firstborn and receiving the blessings itself. He didn't care of what it took to receive it. He just wanted it. He wasn't mad when he gave Jacob the the the the birthight. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Take it. Just give me. I'm so hungry. I'm going to die. He didn't he didn't care about it then. &gt;&gt; He there's no mention of him ever caring about it of of them ever fighting over it of him ever asking for it back. It was only when the the blessings was now going to be showered upon him from his father. He was a blessing believer. &gt;&gt; All he wanted was blessings. He didn't want to sit through the hard times. He didn't want to sit through the hard sermons. All he wanted was was blessings. I just want blessings. You know where most people want their blessings? They want it in their pockets. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And so he just wanted to be blessed and he wanted the firstborn. But uh it was he didn't get mad until he until he really knew, hey, I'm not getting this. &gt;&gt; So the birthright and the blessing, it wasn't for her to give, but the church helped Jacob get the blessing. &gt;&gt; Now, was it right in how she did it? That's where I'm struggling with the the thought. You feel me? because it wasn't right, but yet it was all in the plan of God. &gt;&gt; So, it wasn't hers to give. It's not for the church to give the blessing. It's for the church to lead us to the word to the mail that we might receive our blessing and our inheritance. It's not the churches to give. She can't give it. The ministry can't give it to you. It's something that God must give. But we have to lead you to our heavenly father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so that's where ministries can get off is they lead the people to themselves as a woman &gt;&gt; when that's not where we belong. &gt;&gt; We belong to the male. &gt;&gt; Nothing against women. Hope you don't think that. Now listen to this. I'm going to try to hurry. I know it's Wednesday. Brother Brandham said in spiritual amnesia, he's talking about amn amnesia and what can happen. He says now this is paragraph 40. Now worry sometime can cause it. He's talking about amnesia. And another thing that can cause it among the people is getting between two opinions. That'll cause amnesia. And it gets to you gets you to a place where you actually what you've done. You've lost your reasons. You've lost your mind. Why? Getting between two opinions. Don't get between two opinions. Why? It can cause amnesia. What is amnesia? It's forgetting who you are. &gt;&gt; You start out, you know, like the prodical son. He knew who he was. He wanted his inheritance, but something happened to him. There's a quote in here, and I've been reading it and I couldn't find it, but brother Brandham talks about worldliness. That worldliness can cause amnesia. When we get our eyes on the world instead of the word, it takes our eyes off of off of our uh uh um identity and who we are and off of our inheritance. And it actually changes who we are as believers. Just like Nebuchadnezzar, he was a king, but he lost his identity and he became a beast. &gt;&gt; So, we can lose our identity though we start off good. How do we lose it? We lose it through stress. That's another way. Brother Brandham said we lose it through war. And he said we lose it. We we we we get amnesia. We lose our identity when we're stuck between two opinions. If you want to keep your identity, don't take the opinion of the world and the opinion of the word. Take the opinion of the word. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it'll cause you to stray &gt;&gt; and to lose who you really are. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, ' That's so easy today. Paragraph 45. And we forget sometimes what the Christian church is. We act like the world. That shows that we got spiritual amnesia because that you don't like the Christian. You you don't act like the Christian, you act like the world. You receive the heart of the world and it causes this. So what is it that causes amnesia? He says it happens to the Christian church. We act like the world. It's not just for young people. It's for middle-aged people and it's for old people alike. We let the world creep into our lives and we get stuck between two opinions and we start acting like the world instead of the word and we lose our identity as sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So as God's people in these last days has forgotten what the testimony of being a Christian means. It's again this amnesia has become upon the people. They can't identify themselves. He's saying they're acting like the world instead of the word. Therefore, they're they have forgotten who they are and they can't identify themselves. They forgot all about it. They had forgot his holiness. They had forgot his law. The women were living like the rest of the women. He's talking about Israel in the time of Amos. Go listen to the sermon. It's phenomenal. As the musicians come, we'll bring this to a close. So now we need to be careful that we don't let the things of the world creep in to our lives, to our homes, and to the church. Because when it does, what happens? We get amnesia. We forget who we are. We forget who we belong to. We get stuck between two opinions and we think, "My goodness, this is such a such a struggle. I don't understand why." It's because we're stuck between two opinions. We've let a a YouTube video come in here and something else come in over there and and all of a sudden within our homes, within our lives, and within our church, we've lost the sincerity that we once had. Y &gt;&gt; I just have such a such a burden on my heart that you kind of see the direction of of of of the message. And when I talk about the message, I don't mean about the word. I'm not talking about the male. I'm talking about the female. &gt;&gt; And I'm talking about the children, the families. There's things that are come into our lives and into our homes that 50 years ago never would have been thought of. &gt;&gt; We see people dressing and acting and and and and and in ways that 10 years ago never would have been accepted. What's going on? Like what's it's a it's a question. What's happening? Like what direction is our families going in? What direction is the young girls going in with with with with dress and how they present themselves and and how boys act and how they act around other other girls and how we married people act around each other's wives and like where where are we going, man? &gt;&gt; Amen. What's happening? [Music] We're letting We're changing one word. We're letting the world in instead of the word. &gt;&gt; And we're kicking the word out instead of the world. Can't argue with that. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; it's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We see it. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; And it's a battle within our own all of our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. But understand, we we got to fight against it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like, what are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to just like are we supposed to just lay down and just say, "Well, you know, it is what it is and and uh times have changed and and and you know, the the days of the legalism and the message is gone and and and now we can be free and just let people act and dress however they want and you just don't say anything and just let God do the let God do the the work." How can God do the word without a voice? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you feel Do you feel it? Like &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; You feel the pain. It's not right. [Music] Like what direction are we going as a as the bride of Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] But the buck has got to stop somewhere, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We just continue on and say, "Well, you know, just just love the person and don't say anything and you might offend people and whatever." But but real love, you got to tell somebody, &gt;&gt; you got to tell them what's up, &gt;&gt; right? For lack of better terms. &gt;&gt; And it's not because of hate. And it's not because of putting somebody under the thumb. No, it's because of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're just gone. And I'm not, you might think I'm talking about the church here. I'm I'm talking about I'm talking about churches message families within the church worldwide. And of course, it comes into our own lives. And of course, it comes into our own church. &gt;&gt; But I'm just talking throwing a massive net out there. And I want to ask you the question, what direction are you going in? &gt;&gt; What direction is your family going in? Are you just laying on the couch not doing anything about it? Are you going to decide and say, "You know what? The young man is right. He spoke the word tonight. He's used the quotes. It's it's it's it's all been in order. I I see it through the scripture. I He's right. What am I going to do about it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do about it? What are you going to do about the lack of sincerity, the lack of dedication? What are you going to do about the world creeping into your house? What are you going to do about it? I'm going to try my best to fight against it. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Cuz I am not of the world. &gt;&gt; And I don't want to be a part of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But my identity is found in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to be of the word. And I want to live the word because my life is a mirror of my identity of who I say I am. and so's yours. That's right. &gt;&gt; And so tonight, I I trust that you can take this little sermon and and you might think, well, it's just for the men. Yeah, it's a lot. It's a lot for for the men and for the something for the young singles to think about for the future, but it's also for everybody. Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do about the creeping in of the world into your home and into your life? The choice is yours. The ministry can't make you do anything. Once you leave the building and you go to your car and and you go to your home and that's your that's your place. And what you do there, I guess, is up to you. What I do there is up to me, but I realize it has an effect on everybody else within the assembly. &gt;&gt; Because when Aken did what he did, it didn't just affect his family. It affected everybody within the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Traits, strains, family, upbringings. Wow. things that we all have to deal with, but it's things that you and I can overcome. &gt;&gt; God has put the battle before you. He has laid the word out on your plate tonight. Now, the choice is all up to you. The blood, as we would say, is off my hands. But yet, it's back on me. Because now, what am I going to do with the word that God has placed in my heart to speak to the church tonight? By God's grace. &gt;&gt; I'm going to press on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By God's grace, I'm going to apply the token. &gt;&gt; By God's grace, I'm going to get off the couch. [Music] You know, if you didn't laugh, you would cry. And I'm crying. I'm trying to laugh. So, I stop crying cuz I realize it's a constant battle. And I realize that God is doing something. Something. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; What is God doing right now? You want to know what God is doing? God's bringing us up a little bit higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has taken us from an identity in a church to identity in the word because you can't take the church home with you. &gt;&gt; But you can take the word home with you. You can take the spirit of God home with you. And then you can apply the spirit of God to your home to where it's like the atmosphere of church in our homes. We can't bring you all with us. You can't take me home and I'm not taking you home. My house is full enough. But we can take him home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we can let him do a work in our lives. And we can let him clean up our lives, clean up our spirits, clean up our hearts, &gt;&gt; clean up our children's lives, so on and so forth. What a mighty God we serve. Huh? Let's all stand to our feet tonight. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Father God, I am in awe of you, Lord. And I am in awe of your word and your spirit, Lord. Thank you, Father, for this word. And I thank you that your word will never return void. And so therefore I I have confidence, Lord, not in myself, not in the presentation, not in the words that I spoke, but Lord, in the power of your Holy Spirit, that when it anoints the word to our lives, it brings a change, Lord. And Father, that's our desires this evening. So I pray, Lord, that you would you would please bless your children, those who identify, Lord, as sons and daughters of God. God, I ask you would give them power to overcome, strength to fight the battle, Lord, and to press on and keep on keeping on. We love you, Father. We commit this service, our families, everything, Lord, into thy hands for thy kingdom's glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you.
