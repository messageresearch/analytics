bless you tonight uh we're going to take our Bibles once again in the Book of Luke chapter 22. verse 24. [Music] and there was also a strive among them which of them should be accounted the greatest and he said unto them the kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise Authority upon them are called benefactors but ye shall not be so but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that his chief as he that does serve for whether he is greater he doesn't meet or he that serveth is not the heed that so that seed of it meat but I am among you as he that serveth may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated I'll greet you all once again in the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ uh being grateful once again to our precious Pastor for the opportunity to stand and share the word at the same time also to the Lord Jesus Christ himself because of the way he lead things in such a simplicity uh we come trembling on the pulpit but he manages to put everything in place by showing ahead of time and by the time so human beings by his grace uh we get we get adjusted to him amen we're going to continue with uh our title we have the end times and the super race this will be part five and the coming of the Lord in of the Lord in Babylon part three uh I hope the Lord will allow us to have enough time tonight to finish this part and to get into the bright part of things but if you want sit a little longer it's up to him to him as uh he leads the way we have been covering this this uh title and things from Genesis and time of nimrod and seeing how all this Kingdom we have around us came about how nimrodha we find him in the Book of Genesis as just a man but born out of a woman and a father but this man was anointed in such a way to have a certain Kingdom of his own over time Nimrod had came about just like your normal guy we received him in our churches in our countries and he told us he's going to make our life better just as he did in the Garden of Eden I'll make a few a god say like you know but you already are with God Pastor Adam said that you know we are God made flesh today but he said no what is this as a brother Adam has preach on this no is he preached on that no okay so I am giving you more revelation because he had a powerful thought in mind but remember I'm saying over time we see that along the church ages telling us these are just normal Believers converts of Messengers along the ages but the way unconverted people and since they were unconverted they came around and bringing their own interpretation of the word after bringing all that in and they Blended State and church together and they became more powerful and that's what we read in the world and we speak of the dominating female when you give power and money to somebody who doesn't who's not converted it's uh just a whole big mess because they have a powerful thought in mind because they want to make or give us a better Kingdom than what Michael had proposed to us but but God's grace as we've been seeing this that this was also taking place among the disciples and these disciples where people were converted brought according to Luke 6 Jesus went and prayed all night and came down the mountain and started picking all the disciples this was the Bride of Jesus Christ that Jesus got into courtship with he was showing him showing them the way how to deal with their Ministries how to behave but nevertheless that sin Elijah the Prophet come and go and they were there standing there with the revealed son of man God made flesh again they were standing there and then yet despite of all this great Revelation they had they were standing there and they wanted to become a little bit who's greater Among Us we saw all these things how these things happens among countries and segregation right racism and tribalism and worship of gods and you know all these things from one nation to another all these things that Nimrod has brought about that we start finding that also in the Church of the Living God but they also went uh and brought all kind of systems capitalism Fascism and Nazism uh from Europe and all these things and the word shows us that hey at the end all this will be swallowed up into communism and when you study the word and the Lord has been dealing with me quite a lot probably on those things uh maybe uh at the appointed time to show that communism was getting in taking place and all these things I know when you speak about communism in America not everybody will be happy about it because they don't want it but it's a matter of knowing God's program and when you know God's program you don't have to fight it because brother says yes it's at some stage it's Antichrist but according to the whole program of God that has to be that way we may like it or not because we like our country best because we like the system and we can have all the reasons why we shouldn't have communism but nevertheless it's happening and the more you see on the news what is taking place the bricks and all the revolution in the diverse countries and and stuff and you can just see that well uh the very men who thought that he had a system in place to be able to oppress and to lead the world into a certain kingdom is being just taken by his own trap but nevertheless we'll get to that in the at God's appointed time and things and here now the son of man perceiving what they had what was going on among them and said and he said unto them because there was a strive among them it's not always known when people are striving it's like you know we are we are in this and left and right up and down but then the Lord said no look at me I am among you as a servant the purpose of me living all the throne the praise and everything that I was is to come down to show you how it's supposed to be done and he's showing the Believers a certain path and when he came down he paid a price he nail was nail on the cross according to revelation 12. the dragon looked at the woman with uh with the Sun after the sun was uh was delivered but what I'm saying is like you know this was Jesus Christ when he was born after being born and has done his thing then he was lifted up on the cross he was lifted up on the throne and from Revelation 12 he takes us back in Revelation 1 and Revelation 1 reveals us now this Jesus was ascended on high and set on the cross on the throne now revealing to himself again now to John who was one of the disciples and this bride or this woman that was a head the son over his head and the moon under his feet was taken to the Wilderness and the Wilderness where Branham says it was the United States it says that opens up the church ages he says exactly it says I can prove it to you by the scripture to show you exactly to the date of Plymouth Rock and when he puts it there he says well but then look at what happens because God's program must come to pass because when the bride or the woman of Revelation 12 was going to the wilderness she had to go and be taken care of he says look at that woman when she came to the United States she came for the freedom of worship he said like you know that was the remnant of the woman along the church ages you see every part of the Bride of that Remnant was taken care of until we get to this point here and when she gets to that level then say see now look at what how Jezebel comes behind it as we saw last service then they started building what we call America today from the East the 13 colonies all the way to what we have today and the terminology that we speak here particularly in America of the Wild West because it has to go that way because civilization comes from the East to the west and as he was coming there in the natural it goes the same also in the spiritual also it applies and the Lord after seeing all this now it takes us back in Revelation 14 and in Revelation 14 then we have the Three Angels flying out the first Angel was speaks his message the second angel speaks his message but the third Angel when he comes he also speaks his message but when I'm saying see watch the three walls that follows it and when these three walls start following the third Angel's message then we start seeing that the first war came about the second woke him about but then under after the uh second war is sounded then the angel comes back around they say two woe has passed behold the third world cometh quickly so now when we see these three walls it's connected to the third Angel's message and this third Angel's message is happening exactly at the time that the Angel is coming to call out the people from Babylon and this Babylon is now being given in the type or in a shadow or the image of the Beast before it and we saw last time that the Beast before it was Europe and Europe all the languages all the Techno uh the the the the the learning or all the knowledge came from Europe because Europe took all its Souls from Rome and Rome took it from the Greek the Greek took it from the Egyptian the Egyptians took it from the from Babylon and this Babylon takes us back again as we saw to Nimrod so then we can see the whole bloodline or the whole continuity of the whole thing from the very Inception of it in Genesis all the way as we are standing today in Revelation and now as that we saw last time that now the Lord came down to see what the city that the sons of men have built so when the Lord has to come down the Lord coming down it's not a physical move that human beings we are used to from one step higher to another step but we're going to see tonight by God's grace how the Lord comes down because as we are talking about the coming of the Lord in Babylon because it was important for us first to see where Babylon came from what Babylon does and where Babylon is going but then in between there also we have the third Angel's message because Luther came with the first message uh would John Wesley came with the second message uh justification sanctification but then now this third Angel comes down to take the people out of this Babylon because when we look at Babylon we could have looked at Babylon yesterday as oh some evil Place some place where it's you shouldn't be there but we saw last time that people out there in some poor countries will call they say before you go to heaven come to America because it looks so nice because the media tells them look at what life should look like look at how you should leave look at how you woman you can be free you can do whatever you want just as a last time lasts a few weekends when I was in Mexico showing the brothers like you know this system has brought the people to become independent they do not rely they don't need to depend on the Lord they want to become strong and independent that's why we hear today strong and independent woman but the Lord is now looking for a wife who belongs to him a purge possession she's not free out there doing whatever she wants to do she has also what she has to do because that's what exactly Nimrod did by saying like you know I have the interpretations of the Gods I can tell you how to manipulate I can tell you how to make money see she had made herself rich and has need of Nothing the Same bloodline I'm saying say see give her money she can make her own things and take her to sit back home she'll never do it why because it only requires the Holy Spirit to tell her her position exactly the same way as if did wanting to be in a different position than what she was then today we have all the reasons also that we show why we should be independent and strong a strong Nation a stronger brother a strong teacher who thinks that you know brother Branham has made mistakes left and right all those mindset shows us where it started because at the end of the day Nimrod wanted to be worshiped and worship it's not necessarily the fact of kneeling down but embracing a certain ways of perception of life but then by embracing that perception of life that's the way idolatry comes into place because he said to Israel he said woe unto you who go seek help in Egypt they started worshiping there he says but well I have cherish you I have espoused you I am taking care of you why are you standing there and go look for help somewhere else we see that all over the Bible in the time of Samuel and uh all these times here then the Lord and the Bible says that Genesis verse chapter 11 it says and the whole earth was of one language of one speech and he came to pass as the journey from the East that they found a plane in the land of shinda and they dwell there and they say the one to another Guru go to let us make break and burn them firstly and they had brief for stone slime had uh they murdered and they said go to let us build the city and Tower whose top May reach unto heaven let's Elevate our statue let's become civilized let's be developed let become brighter as we saw last time about how the United States came about verse 5 and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men build it because this city had given people the understanding that we don't need God we are a free people a free Nation but yes they came for freedom of religion but then quickly it was the the Beast spoke like a lamb it looked like a lamb but then quickly spoke like the dragon before it and this Dragon says is our American buffalo it looks like a lamb [Music] doesn't really look dangerous but when you get around it you can get into much trouble amen because now this Beast as its building hit they said like you know oh look at this the whole nation now the whole nation when the United States goes everywhere they say like you know we will tell you how to do it we will show you how to do it then the Lord must come down but then how does the Lord come down in the message the mark of the beast and the Seal of God part two paragraph 109 watch the first Angel and the and the Reformation Luther preached the gospel second Angel Wesley Wesley a sanctification before the fornication he straightened up the church but the third message the message the Pentecostal message should be the true message it should be the true Messenger warning them to escape the mock of the Beast saying whosoever receives the mark of the beast the same will drink the wrath of God put out without me without mixture into the cup of of indignation and poured out upon the people that's the very message today the third Angel the third message the last message the Lutheran message of justification the Western message of sanctification and the Pentecostal message of the Seal of God escaped The Mark of the Beast come out of them big walls of Babylon be sealed into the kingdom of God because we saw that Jesus telling the disciples I am pointing you unto a kingdom because the same Jesus had to come down according to Luke 1 the angel had come and spoke to the uh to uh to uh the father of of John the Baptist and said you shall have a son and this son shall do a pod of Malachi 4 when he does that part of taking the further the faith of the fathers to the children then now the scripture stops there then now we have the other part of returning the faith of the the children to the fathers because that the bride or the woman along the time that she was taken care of Into the Wilderness the whole word was all scattered about people had brought all kind of ideas why because Nimrod was able to get into the church got all the money build all these things and have all this everything that he wanted to do so now brother random is showing us that the third angel has to do this in the same message paragraph 30 now this is the third Angel's message to the world and you know what's the total the third age Angel's message is going forth now in this day this is the flying of the third Angel's message if you believe a Bible reader there was three words followed it the first one happened in World War one second one happened in World War II you see what's going in uh what's what we're going in now all right we at the end of the road because of the security that Babylon has given to the people he says that we don't need to go anywhere else this is the place to be and make me enough money I see my doctors left and right but he said like you know no no no no no we at the end of the road that's where you see the place of communism because now since now America doesn't want communism to come it has to be there so that America can impose War upon the system of Communism so that God can bring his word to pass the whole program of God is becoming full is being fulfilled before our wandering eyes we're standing and we're looking and we're seeing oh it's happening then what what is then what is our Escape the Bible says Revelation 14 the third Angel comes in to say like you know here's the door of Escape the same way that Jesus came to the disciples said like you know pray that your fleeing should not be in winter because as you see they all Miss surrounding Jerusalem no the time is at hand so as we are standing Faithfully seeing watching the news many times you will say like you know Vlad me should just leave power and give us peace but to those who have received the third Angels message are being made aware of preparation time for departure because that departure is a secret and certain departure and this departure is only to a qualified group it's not the fact of just coming to church listening to a sermon and all these things because also Nimrod came to church Judas came to church he was given all the money he was in collaboration with all the denominations and by having that a veil was put on him so that he may not see what is going on at times blessings material blessing or financial blessing it's not always a sign that God is with you because of this money these are all the independence we have can put us in a condition that I don't need that today I don't need to a pastor to tell me anything I don't need a husband to tell me anything I don't need a prophet to tell me anything but be also aware of that condition where is it going to put you in amen question and answers you see brother Branham shows us now how now this Angel is coming down how the Lord is coming down because as the Lord is coming down it says in question and answer uh number two uh 1964 paragraph 114. now we say this with reserve and love and respect see as Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and also that in the last days as it was before lost time or in lost time in Sodom so shall it be in the day that the Son of Man reveals himself again revealing himself no in these last days the logos that was Upon Jesus Upon Jesus which he has become from the back of the pillow fire again and has descended down on Earth he says I was going to say something but I watched the tape they wouldn't believe that in if I told them it wouldn't make any difference people wouldn't believe it but I'll omit that but has come down for like in investing judgment goes on the angel the time that people are sitting the Lord in Genesis 11 we see he's coming down to see what city that the sons of man have built and here now the same pillow fire now is coming down again for an investigation judgment because God does not bring somebody to judgment without first warning him so the angel has to come down the third Angel has to come down the pillow fire has to come down it's coming down to do an investigation because if we have a if a situation rises in the land we send the FBI the FBI comes down for investigation then after the investigation is done it's given to the court the quotes now will pronounce the judgment because that God has to warn you first you've been doing this you've been doing this and leaving all this kind of Life who you've been having all this your own interpretation of the word but you say he has to come down paragraph 116 then watch The Works of it Among Us proves the same Jesus does once live in Palestine The Same Spirit was upon him as come through a body until it's come back to headship again which is is coming soon to claim the body amen the heads coming to the body you get it that will be the Son of God the son of man the son of the son of David the I am the rose of Sharon the lily of the valley the Morning Star I am not he I am his servant and the pillow fire is not he it's he it's in spirit form see which was upon the son of man has come now to anoint sons of men to bring back a Ministry just exactly like he said he would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect together at the same time of Investigation judgment it is some time that the son of man is building all these great things and all that the the the trumpers and all the the weapons and they can go from one uh side of the world to another in just a matter of seconds in that time is also coming down to also do certain things this pillow fire this great spirit but random says obey the angel the voice of the Angel paragraph 1950 and John and then John the reveler the whole book of Revelation when it was wrote he said I have sent my angel Jesus did and John fell down to worship the angel but the angel said stand up worship God see through angel of God won't stand to be worshiped and he said that he was or he was of the prophets and was his fellow man that had been sent to signify these things John he's standing there he's looking and he's watching what time because John he's looking and seeing what is taking place he's seeing the country or the land that the sons of men have built at that same time God now Jesus sends his Angel and his angel now when the angel now stop talking to John John the bride and not the son of Zebedee but he's looking and he's saying this is such a great mystery I could have I known I could have I knew how to deal with this element here then John wanted to worship remember what we saw how Nimrod came about and brought Worship in the church having all this idol worship that's why even today that many people are even afraid to say that I am in the message of the hour because some people think that people in the message of the hour who worship brother Branham some if they see you even with the pitch of brother Branham they are afraid they think of you as a worshiper of brother Branham why because Jonah the bride was about to worship he was about to worship then the angel told him no I am a man saved by grace despite the ministry that God has allotted to me the reason why you see all this ministry it's because I have healed myself to him that's right the fact I've healed myself to him I am also showing you how to heal yourself to him that's why this ministry comes down also to have sons of men so to reconnect that Fellowship that relationship between the head and the rest of the body and all these things is taking place right down there in Babylon it's not taking place in the skies it's not taking place in a secluded area no as Jeremiah told them he said go out there get married do all these things here lest you be consumed you'll be terminated but at the same time you know that according to the prophecy the time is at hand according to the voice of Malachi 4 that this is the way of escape the Lord is coming down as it says that you know no I am one of the prophets worship God therefore Angelic beings is ordained ministers of God to come to the Earth to Bear record of God and they work through moral beings it just as they did through Daniel and back through the ages there and I believe it with all my heart the time in which there we are living in this investigation judgment it's also bringing a fellowship a communication a delivery precisely for the ministry of Sons of men because each son of man not the son of man but a son of man each of our Ministries is being attended to by Angelic beings these Angelic beings are called our theophanese because when we hear from our theophanese we are being realigned to be able to receive that uninterrupted communication that's why broadbandam says the voice of God in these last days in the days that the media wants to speak to your soul they want to pervert you they want to make you strong and dependent but now also the communication is also happening and only these communications only given to a qualified group and this qualified group is only those who are ready to surrender because the wave sheath has he was receiving these communications he thought that it was him he's not like you know he was his ability to do things then the angel came and said do you think that you're the one that makes all to see those visions do you think that you're the one that makes all these sermons to bring him to be away of how immaterial and yet material that communication is how that presence is when it became aware of it it says the reason why I have you always come to the right it's because I know he's here you say sister you see you know why I'm waiting I'm basically waiting for him to come and when he gets in but the voice is still the same when you listen to the tape you say did you hear that that was not me but that was him but look how immaterial we thought like you know the the Lord coming down we will see the sky opening up and the angel blowing trumpets and all these things here but in that Simplicity this is what we're going to see next and it says so therefore paragraph 13 but God's gift is the spirit of God that came down in the form of an Angel the spirit of God coming taking a form a form of an Angelic being I was in need then somebody shows up how did you know that I needed this help I don't know I just felt that I had to come sorry material but I just had to obey and that obedience made then people become odd how do you believe how can you be this way look look at the woman today how can you dress this way you know you have the freedom this is a land of the Brave and and you can just do whatever you want but only the qualified group could be able to understand that communication no he didn't have any he didn't have wings it looked like a man I heard him he walked brother Branham illustrate just as dead and walked on the floor walked right over as normal as any man many times we're looking for him so far am says look next to you I know his mistakes I know what he's done yesterday I know what is this here but he is the one in simplicity because perfect weakness brings perfect strength now that strength is not the one that you know you sleep with you wake up with you know the night and day how he was born and what mistakes he does but the perfect one comes down and he uses a vessel with his mistakes and aligning that vessel to himself because the statue of a perfect man is not according to Human idology oh but you heard it thinking the other day oh but you were speeding oh but you haven't paid your taxes or you haven't paid your tithes yes he didn't yet the ministry Angelic beings have come down for him you might not like it you might debate about it but it is so you may not like it like you know how come you know he made a mistake here and how come can he be the prophet of the age and now calling the first holster to be to be Jesus yes it is true nevertheless the ministry is to him you can have all the reasons in the world of why not it shouldn't be that's true nevertheless God said I have chosen him he he him is the one he's the one that is the worship of the age therefore it brings to our mind to understand despite of all that I am you can sit there in your room you know that Lord I know this about me I know this about Thee I know this about me but he says it's not about you but it's about the work that I have done and this work that he has done it's not according to your mind you might not understand everything you might not see everything even when you die you might even go with questions about certain things but nevertheless he has chosen you by him choosing you it's not about like then Jesus says like you know don't count yourself to be the greatest is looking at his bride he said I know that weakness Paul said I prayed three times Lord deliver me deliver me he said no my grace is sufficient unto you but does that mean that we know we should go and do whatever we want to do no the angel coming down whatever I'm saying it looked like any one of us like any man he said like you know well he didn't have beard and he did long hair at times we'll we will mistaken him just like you know maybe some buddy yo there's some homeless person because he just looked like any man hmm he says the healing of Jairus and the healing of Jairus daughter I was baptizing them at the spring of the down there in progress 86 to to save us time it says the career General uh how go away it's highlighted Mystic light appears Overlook about this uh evangelists were baptizing at the river very Mystic thing people could not understand manifested at the presence of it it was the angel of the Lord come right down and hung over where I was amen that we know that some of us who are older is probably made have hunted with nevertheless the angel of the Lord came down to deal with him then notice one through life paragraph 87 then notice one done through life it kept appearing one day under the appearing of this light came forth an angel that told me I was to pray for the sick people your very life what is the angel doing bringing this communication and instead now revealing to him what is the purpose of his life because he's been hearing with this voice don't do that don't defile your body don't do this here what is this voice why can't I just be like the rest of the people you understand that so it is the same with any one of us whatever voice that you hear whatever feeling you have it's not just like human capacity to think because at the same time you can look on the side and see that somebody else is doing exactly what you who are not told to do why because this light this Spirit coming into the form of a light and now from the light now is revealing himself even more uh in the in the uh Ephesian Church age I didn't give it to you Brothers I'll just uh quote it this year you see Paul knew the first revelation was correct God did God can give a first revelation then a second Revelation if he did he would be changing his mind he can give a revelation then add to it what is he doing from the pillow fire is coming down from the the angel of the light now we have Angel as a man he gave that the pillow fire that was Upon Jesus will come back again to deal with sons of men to connect the head with the body and from the body now he is showing us how is he doing it is giving a light and from this light now in the in the in the cabin now this is in the cave sorry then now a man comes forth and now when the man comes forth he tells him hey you are called to pray for the sick he has heard this as a whirlwind he was scared he's like you know what is this what kind of experience is this what's going on but then when he said fear not he said yes I knew right away yes I knew right away then you conscious they say like oh I was praying about this and I felt to this this I think then the brother comes around and tells you something it's like exactly what did the Lord just spoke to me there yesterday there then you know that this is the same pattern that the angel of the Lord is coming nearer and narrower to you he says that he's he's going and to enter it as it did as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed of the seed to the woman and then let it designated that seed had to come through Abraham and then letter said he will come by the same blood in the in the same blood line in David but it was the same revelation it only gave people more information to help them receive and understand it what we are listening to this communication in the midst of Babylon the Lord is coming down for an investigation judgment and yet at the same time now there's a way of Escape but how does it bring us to escape by bringing Now The Same Spirit in the form of the pillow fire in the form of an Angel now stop communicating with you what is the purpose of your life what is the purpose of his life well now it goes on he says well this has been happening he says well to pray for the sick people I told him I couldn't do it just as we always do brother can you help with this I can do it brother can you show up here I can do it you know only excuses in the world I can't I can't I can't I can't there's nothing new Under the Sun that's why when you deal with the church we love the church as it is because even brother Branham himself one is like you know this rickian ricketters is like no among them they are my children he knows God himself knows how he has planted the seed and Whey has planted the seed he didn't plant the seed out there in a very nice garden and all this no implanted them a day in Babylon he said like you know I shall come at the appointed time because the ministers wanted to pluck up everything they wanted like you know you did this leave the church you did this don't come to me anymore you said no no no no no no leave them grow let them grow but The Minister's responsibility is not to come and Peter you love me feed my sheep feed my sheep at the appointed time they shall hear it because the worship of the hour went through the same process the man looked at it and said like you know oh I wanted to be a ranger out there I wanted to be a ranger I wanted to be this excuse me but because he was seed because you were seed then it takes you and leads your life you might not like it but then you might you'll find that that he is his purpose is stronger than you put your personal will I want to be in the military but the Lord said like no that's not your place Billy your place is here next to me nevertheless I'm going there you go there you just speak no you can't you can we can take you but you able to withstand to stand in the presence of the Angel of the Lord night and day Billy go give the star the cause the angel is right there and he knows it to this day he said I know exactly when the the presence is there I know it but he can stand that the bullets in the army why because God had built him for a specific purpose God has built us for a specific work we might love what we love left and right but remember you need to learn to surrender learn to surrender because William Burnham says oh I should have known if I could if I had known my first 20 years I would have given it to him why because it's been aligned now with God's program in that program now is able now to see like you know I need this I need to I have to be displaced here it's like you know wherever I go when I go to Germany in Africa and when these sources are they want to uh to attack me and do all these things here you say like you know when the Lord sends you it doesn't make you offer running material it puts you in a position that despite of the challenges and everything he said like you know it's not my job it best is work he's the one to come and do it now each one of us now have to have the same confidence in whatever we do [Applause] let let you be an accountant and engineer whatever you have to be you must have that same Commission you are called to pray for the people I am called to be a housewife I am called to be a mother I am called to be a minister each one of us according to the parent we need to know how to get closer to him and the more we get closer to him the more glorious the ministry is and the more then you have success then you look then people come to you how did you do it how did you prepare it it's like I don't know I just came up there and I just touched it and it just happened why because the angel of the Lord receives you in that position sees you in the place and he wants you to stay in that place but then when you start embracing out ideas strong independent woman then now see the trouble but Abraham says see when Jesus left Lazarus house look at trouble set in amen I'm not even halfway but God's grace but we'll uh we'll get there I knew that but God's grace will get there it's almost time but God revealing himself to his people and I looked and I seen I seen his feet and when it got to me he was a tall man he was a heavy said weighed about 200 pounds look like just as natural as I'm standing here he had his arm folded like that like this first time I ever seen him in that form he walked right up there I was there he looked down he had a smooth face he's giving out details about uh about about the men the the expression he was a sympathetic kind-hearted he said fear not experiences but he says I said there was a light came in the room that little hold the Huddle there there was as it was or it was a no flaw in it it didn't have a window and he's also telling here the experience and stuff how when he was born I said since that time from his birth you understand that understand that the pattern here is not tied to one man I read you the quotation sons of men being reconnected to the Head he says now from that time what time from his birth he said he said he since that time it's been with me it's an angel of God he met me in person a few years ago from our birth but remember to say you say you say you see Moses uh Moses movie about the the the the the pillow fire the cloud he said you see those leaks of fire you say like you know that how it is with every believer each one of us with our leak of Fire in our little Ministry known or unknown but none of the angel Angelic beings sent to minister to the sons of God at the time of the investigation judgment investigating what nimrod with everything that he has done how he's able now to change men into women all these things here is coming to investigate and at the same time is also showing the same thing the ministry Moses Ministry uh Souls that are not that are in prison now the ones out from under the blood they die without Mercy that is a Babylon that was Moses let's pull first a young man talking to Israel second went down to deliver them and third was the last message the Miracles had been done Moses was on his road to the promised land with the redeemed oh God be merciful I pray in Jesus name the bride the people the so this wave chief coming into the land doing all this work why because he was able to realign himself because Moses down there in Egypt he was just thinking like you know I'm the just the next Pharaoh in the throne they probably want to become a pharaoh that's when I'll be able to to change all the laws in the land then I'll be able to free the people but God said not your ways but my ways and his ways led him to kill an Egyptian and to become a murderer look for in Egypt then he couldn't be there then he had to meet the pillar of Fire you will see the pattern the same pillow fire giving us life story Exodus one to three is the same pillow Fire coming down giving us life story today and the same pillow fire bought a coming at your birth bringing you as a young man for you determining your ministry and to bring the redeem to the promised land because when you get the pattern on how God deals with the prophet he says like you know as I've dealt with him so shall I do with you because the principle of God is to do it today being the same yesterday today and forever and if it's the same today is still doing the same thing and as he's still coming and doing the same thing then we are aware of what kind of people we are we are not part of Babylon we are not part of the Democrats we are not part of the Republicans they can do all that they want but we have to know that this communication that we are receiving from this Angelic being is to take us out because that that's the only Escape that we have and if we don't have this Escape then they died there without Mercy because behold the third world cometh quickly may God bless you praise the Lord are you glad you've been called out of Babylon amen let's all stand tonight let's sing that song Let the worshipers arise praise the Lord song says I see a line being drawn in the sand I want to make sure I'm on the right side of that line tonight amen
