[4:39] You make your mercy new every day. Let's

[5:03] more. There's one thing I know for
[5:07] sure. Fresh as a
[5:11] morning. You make your mercy
[5:17] new every morning. Sing the first verse.
[5:23] And
[5:25] I thought that I had crossed the
[5:30] line. Walked away from love one
[5:33] [Music]
[5:36] time. Too many.
[5:42] And
[5:44] I thought I'd used up all the
[5:49] grace set aside for my
[5:56] mistakes. So many.
[5:59] [Music]
[6:01] But on my
[6:03] knees I found to my
[6:10] surprise that your
[6:13] mercy
[6:14] renews with the
[6:17] [Music]
[6:20] sunrise. You make your mercy new every
[6:24] day. Oh, you change my life in so many
[6:28] ways.
[6:31] You pray over me in your sweet
[6:34] grace. You can
[6:37] fill
[6:39] me yesterday, today, forever
[6:44] more. Oh, there's one thing I know for
[6:49] sure. Fresh as a morning new, you make
[6:54] your mercy new.
[6:59] every morning second
[7:03] verse and
[7:06] all the wasted times that I have
[7:11] known. A prodigal away from home.
[7:19] God
[7:22] knowing that every
[7:25] day your grace is
[7:32] multiplied with
[7:35] forgiveness waiting to
[7:42] provide. You make your mercy new every
[7:45] day.
[7:47] Oh, you changed my life in so many
[7:52] ways. You cradled me in your sweet
[7:56] grace. You
[7:59] fill
[8:02] me yesterday, today, forever
[8:06] more. There's one thing I know for sure.
[8:12] Fresh as the
[8:15] morning, you make your mercy
[8:18] [Music]
[8:20] new. Every
[8:23] morning. Amen. So glad for those mercies
[8:26] that are new each and every morning.
[8:29] Amen. I'd like to ask brother Elias
[8:31] Paige if you'd come, Elias, and take us
[8:33] to the Lord in prayer
[8:35] tonight. Have a praise report from
[8:38] sister Nancy. I want to thank each of
[8:40] you for praying for me during my minor
[8:42] surgery. It was successful and they
[8:45] found no cancer. Now I go to my to the
[8:49] new doctor that Sister Becky helped me
[8:51] to find. Thank you again, Sister Nancy.
[8:53] So let's continue to remember Sister
[8:54] Nancy in prayer and faithful warrior.
[8:57] It's always good to see her there in the
[8:59] back. Amen. Brother Greg Yarro is not
[9:01] feeling well tonight, so he's asked that
[9:02] we remember him in prayer.
[9:05] Sister Flo Peterson says that this past
[9:09] Thursday, a classmate of mine passed
[9:11] away after a seizure. He was very young,
[9:14] always kind towards me. Please pray for
[9:16] his family and his friends. So, let's
[9:19] pray for the family, the friends of this
[9:21] young man.
[9:22] And somehow, may the Lord speak to them
[9:24] through all of this. Amen. God is
[9:27] capable of doing anything. His ways are
[9:30] beyond our understanding. Amen. And if
[9:32] you have a need tonight, I just want to
[9:33] lift that before the Lord for their
[9:37] lies. Let's just all
[9:40] pray. Lord, Father, it's just such a
[9:43] good opportunity, Father, to be in your
[9:44] house once again, Father, to set aside
[9:47] from our busy schedules,
[9:49] Father. Lord, it takes you to come in
[9:53] and intervene in our lives, Father.
[9:55] Lord, Father, as I hold these needs in
[9:57] my hand, Father, I can't remember them
[9:59] all, but Father, you know each one. You
[10:02] could come down and meet meet each need,
[10:04] Father, according to your will, Father.
[10:07] So, I ask on these behalfs of these
[10:08] needs, Father, come and intervene,
[10:10] Father. We know you do everything in a
[10:13] good and perfect timing, Father. We know
[10:16] you work all things for the good,
[10:18] Father. I'm just asking for the song
[10:20] service, Father, as we praise and
[10:22] worship your name, Father. Just be with
[10:23] our midst, Father. be with brother
[10:26] Lindsay as he comes forth, Father, and
[10:28] preaches your word, Father. We know it's
[10:29] not you, Father. We know it's you,
[10:31] Father. And you know, we know it's not
[10:33] the man, Father. Push him aside, Father.
[10:36] Lord, we just love you. We thank you,
[10:38] Father. We just ask these things in your
[10:40] name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[10:44] Amen. You may be seated tonight. Praise
[10:46] the
[10:47] Lord. It's good to be in the house of
[10:49] the Lord tonight and want to welcome
[10:50] each one and those who be on the
[10:52] internet. Want to wish my daughter Lissa
[10:54] happy birthday. Probably shouldn't say
[10:56] how old she is, but she celebrated 29 a
[10:59] few times now, but love Lissa and
[11:01] appreciate what the Lord's done in her
[11:03] life. Amen. Just a reminder, Sunday

[11:10] 6:00 p.m. Amen. Thank you. Today that
[11:13] song, this world is not my home. I'm
[11:15] just passing through. Amen.
[11:20] This world is not my home. I'm just a
[11:24] passing through. My treasures are laid
[11:28] up. Somewhere beyond the blue, the
[11:32] angels beckon me from heaven's open
[11:36] door. And I can feel at home in this
[11:40] world
[11:41] anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no
[11:45] friend like you. If heaven's not my
[11:49] home, then Lord, what would I do? The
[11:53] angels beckon me from heaven's open
[11:57] door. And I can't feel at home in this
[12:01] world
[12:02] anymore. They're all expecting me. And
[12:06] that's one thing I know. I fixed it up
[12:10] with Jesus oh many years ago. I know
[12:14] he'll see me through. Though I am weak
[12:18] anymore and I can't feel at home in this
[12:22] world
[12:23] anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no
[12:28] friend like you. If heaven's not my
[12:31] home, then Lord, what would I do? The
[12:35] angels beckon me from heaven's open
[12:39] door. And I can't be at home in this
[12:43] world anymore.
[12:45] Just over in the glory land will live
[12:49] eternally. The saints on every hand
[12:53] they're shouting
[12:54] victory. The songs of sweetest praise
[12:58] bring back from heaven show. I can't
[13:01] feel at home in this world
[13:05] anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no
[13:09] friend like you. If heaven's not my
[13:12] home, then Lord, what would I do? The
[13:16] angels beck at me from heaven to the
[13:20] door. And I can't let in this world
[13:25] anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no
[13:30] friends like you. If heaven's not my
[13:33] home, then Lord, what would I do? The
[13:37] angels back at me from heaven's open
[13:40] door. I can't be left in this
[13:47] world. Oh by and by. When the morning
[13:52] comes, when all the saints of God are
[13:57] gather, we will tell the story how we
[14:02] come and we'll understand it better. By
[14:06] and
[14:07] by, we are often tossed and riveted on
[14:11] the restless sea of time. Super skies
[14:14] and how tempest drops succeed a bright
[14:17] sunshine in that land of perfect day.
[14:21] When the mist have come away, we will
[14:24] understand it better by and by.
[14:29] Oh, by and by when the morning
[14:36] comes of God are gathered home. We will
[14:39] tell the story how we've overcome and
[14:44] we'll understand it better by and
[14:48] by. And we are often destitute of the
[14:52] things that life demands. Want of food
[14:55] and want of shelter. thirsty hills, bar
[14:58] and land. Trusting in the Lord and
[15:02] according to his word, we will
[15:05] understand it better. By and
[15:08] by, oh by and by. When the morning
[15:13] comes, when all the saints of God are
[15:18] gathered home, we will tell the story
[15:22] how we overcome and we'll understand it
[15:26] better. Sing the chorus
[15:28] again. Oh, by and by. When the morning
[15:33] comes, when all the saints of God are
[15:38] gathered home, we will tell the story
[15:42] how we've overcome and we'll understand
[15:46] it
[15:46] [Music]
[15:50] better. Oh, see the bright light
[15:54] shine. Words just about hold

[23:33] Thank the Lord. So, we praise God for
[23:35] that. I do have a baby dedication
[23:38] tonight. If
[23:40] uh our brother Justin and sister shalom,
[23:44] love all will come at this time. Let's
[23:45] sing that song. Bring them in. Bring
[23:47] them in. Bring the little ones to Jesus.
[23:50] Oh, bring them
[23:53] in. Bring them
[23:56] in. Bring them in from the world of
[24:02] sin. Bring them
[24:06] in. Bring them
[24:09] in. Bring the little ones to Jesus.
[24:15] [Music]
[24:17] Praise the Lord.
[24:20] Amen. You know there are several
[24:22] milestones in one's life. One is a
[24:25] birth, then is a
[24:27] dedication, then it is your
[24:30] conversion, then
[24:33] marriage and then eventually the chapter
[24:36] of your life is
[24:37] closed which you know it's from the time
[24:41] of the birth till death. But during that
[24:45] whole time,
[24:46] imagine all the things that God has
[24:49] watched over you, blessed you with so
[24:52] many things and kept your life and we're
[24:55] just proud of Brother Justin, Sister
[24:58] Shalom. Look at these beautiful little
[25:00] kids they got. My I tell you, Amen. I I
[25:04] think we got I Yeah, I must say we have
[25:08] some of the best looking little babies
[25:10] born in this church. I don't know. Uh
[25:13] maybe I'm partial, but I I I just think
[25:15] that we do have some absolutely
[25:18] beautiful little babies. So they have
[25:21] got a little one there here. Do you say
[25:25] aliyah? Aaliyah. A l i y a h. It's
[25:28] Hebrew means exalted or to ascend to
[25:33] royalty.
[25:35] To ascend to royal. Wow. I tell you
[25:38] that's powerful. Amen. I tell you. Ed in
[25:42] gan g e a n it is means that god is
[25:46] gracious. Amen. So praise the lord. I
[25:49] I've always told you that I do believe
[25:52] that it's extremely important that you
[25:54] name your children names that have
[25:57] character. Amen. Okay. Especially that
[26:00] that you want to have them go in a
[26:03] certain direction. They face such a hard
[26:05] time as it is. Yeah. Best thing you can
[26:08] do is give them a name that will bless
[26:10] them. And so the Bible says, let me get
[26:13] my glasses
[26:16] here in Mark 13, excuse me, chapter
[26:21] 10:3. And they brought young children to
[26:25] him that he should touch them. And his
[26:28] disciples rebuked those that brought
[26:30] them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much
[26:33] displeased and said unto them, "Suffer
[26:36] the little children to come unto me, and
[26:38] forbid them not. For of such is the
[26:41] kingdom of God, and verily, verily, I
[26:43] say unto you, whosoever shall not
[26:45] receive the kingdom of God as a little
[26:48] child, he shall not enter therein." He
[26:51] took them up in his arms, put his hands
[26:54] upon them, and blessed them. Amen. One
[26:59] of the most important things that you
[27:01] can do, I believe, as after the birth of
[27:04] the child and and everything is to bring
[27:06] them forward, have them dedicated. Amen.
[27:09] God bless you richly that you have that
[27:12] that you that you have that
[27:15] desire. And so now we'll take this
[27:17] little one. Come on up here a little bit
[27:19] closer. Amen. Yes.
[27:24] Oh, she's awake.
[27:29] Yeah. Yeah. She's uh Oh, the bright
[27:32] lights. I think kind of takes after
[27:35] daddy a little bit shy in front of all
[27:37] these people,
[27:39] too. We love I tell you what, we love
[27:42] all the love alls. Amen. And come on up
[27:46] here just a wee bit
[27:49] closer. Now Jesus took the little
[27:51] children and put them in his arms and he
[27:55] blessed them. Now, I stand
[27:57] here as a representative of
[28:00] him. And we're going to ask now that God
[28:04] would take this little one, this little
[28:06] love
[28:07] gift, Aaliyah
[28:12] Jean. And we're going to dedicate her
[28:14] back to God now. Amen. For a life of
[28:17] service. Heavenly
[28:20] Father, I hold in my hands Aaliyah Jean
[28:23] love
[28:24] all a love gift that you have given to
[28:28] brother Justin Shalom that they might
[28:31] raise her in the nurture and admonition
[28:34] of the
[28:35] Lord. Father, they are a faithful
[28:40] couple. They believe your word. They
[28:43] believe your message. Amen. And father
[28:46] God, they're going to raise up this
[28:48] little girl. They've named her such a
[28:51] beautiful name. One who is gracious from
[28:56] God and who is going to ascend to a to
[28:59] royalty. One who is
[29:01] exalted. Aaliyah Jean love all now. I
[29:04] bless you right now. And I ask that God
[29:08] give you health, virtue, and strength.
[29:12] That you would rise above all of the
[29:14] loud and age and the spirits of this
[29:17] time. May these little feet, Father, may
[29:20] they stand upon every promise. May these
[29:23] eyes behold your virtue and your glory.
[29:28] The hands may they do things father and
[29:31] work for your glory at one day if you
[29:33] should tar your coming.
[29:36] Aaliyah Jean love all now I bless you
[29:40] for a life of service to your great God
[29:44] and I pray that you will know him in a
[29:48] very personal way that your revelation
[29:51] will be her strength or quickening
[29:53] power. I pray and dedicate her now back
[29:56] to you for a life of service in the name
[29:59] of the Lord Jesus
[30:01] Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[30:15] Their little daughter looking at me like
[30:18] I don't know. I think that's that guy I
[30:20] hear yelling at people on Sunday.
[30:24] You
[30:25] know, God bless
[30:28] you what a
[30:31] privilege, what a privilege it is to
[30:33] serve God. Amen.
[30:36] Amen. He says, "Come unto me all ye that
[30:39] are weary and are heavy laden, and I
[30:41] will give you rest." Thank you, Lord. I
[30:43] will give you a peace that the world
[30:45] does not give. I'll give you a peace
[30:47] that passes all understanding. I thank
[30:51] God that I know that. Let's stand
[30:52] together. to turn service to our brother
[30:56] Mark and let him lead us in another
[30:59] chorus. And our brother Lindsay is here
[31:02] this evening. He said, "Brother Ron, you
[31:04] don't have to minister me when I come
[31:07] in." I said, "Brother Lindsay, let me
[31:09] tell you, we love you." Amen. We have
[31:12] confidence in you. And I says, "And I
[31:15] love to have the five-fold ministry."
[31:16] Brother Warren, it's good to have you
[31:18] here tonight. I know you weren't feeling
[31:19] well. God bless you. Raise you up.
[31:22] Uh, and but brother Lindsay, I said,
[31:26] "Brother Lindsay, you're not a stranger
[31:28] to us. Come in here." I love to have a
[31:31] well-rounded part of uh the five-fold
[31:34] ministry. I mean, we had brother Chad,
[31:37] we had the different ministers here that
[31:40] had spoke for us, Brother Jason. And you
[31:44] were blessed because of the direction
[31:47] and the uniqueness of their ministries.
[31:51] Yes. And that's what I love because they
[31:54] come in and they have a certain
[31:55] perspective, a certain way of ministry,
[31:58] diversities of gifts, but one spirit.
[32:01] Amen. So, I'm just very proud to have
[32:03] our brother Lindsay McGrady to come up
[32:06] here and speak for us. And he said,
[32:08] "Well, brother Ron, you don't have to."
[32:10] I I said, "Brother Lindsay, I think you
[32:12] know me well enough that if our schedule
[32:15] was full and we didn't have an
[32:17] opportunity, I would just say just sit
[32:19] down." He said, "You know what, Brother
[32:21] Ron?" He says, "I love to eat." And he
[32:23] says, "When I go to somebody else's
[32:25] church, I like to I like to put my feet
[32:27] under their table and just be fed." But
[32:31] um anyway, we've asked him to speak this
[32:34] evening. Brother Mark, if you would lead
[32:35] us in worship. Pour your spirit out on
[32:38] me. Pour your spirit out on
[32:44] me. All just like the rain.
[32:48] [Music]
[32:52] Saturate my
[32:54] thirsty
[32:56] soul. Come and fall aresh on
[33:01] me. Fill my cup
[33:06] again. Fill my
[33:09] heart and make me whole.
[33:16] I
[33:17] need you
[33:19] now for your Sing it again as we invite
[33:23] him to have his way
[33:24] tonight. Pour your spirit out on
[33:30] me. All just like the rain.
[33:34] [Music]
[33:37] saturate my thirsty
[33:41] [Music]
[33:43] [Applause]
[33:44] [Music]
[33:47] soul. My cup
[33:52] again. Heal my
[33:54] heart and make me whole.
[34:01] I
[34:02] need you
[34:04] now for your spirit.
[34:09] [Music]
[34:11] Amen. Praise the Lord. Don't we need him
[34:15] tonight? Amen. We need him every day,
[34:17] every hour. You know, sometimes we I
[34:21] think we fail to recognize just how much
[34:23] we need him, how much we're dependent
[34:26] upon him. You know, and he told us
[34:28] plainly there in John the 15th chapter.
[34:30] Without me, you can do nothing. That's
[34:33] right. And uh I know that. I know that
[34:37] very much that it takes the Lord. For
[34:39] you to be blessed, for you to be helped,
[34:40] it would be nothing that I could do. It
[34:42] all would be him. It would all be the
[34:45] Lord. And uh I guess that brother, I do
[34:49] qualify as a
[34:52] well-rounded part of the ministry. I'm
[34:55] too well-rounded. I need to be less
[34:58] well-rounded. But uh I thought, well, I
[35:00] qualify for that part. I I do know that.
[35:03] Amen. But it's certainly certainly a
[35:05] privilege to be here with you guys.
[35:06] Always love the the presence of the Lord
[35:09] that I feel when I come here. Just the
[35:11] the welcoming the spirit. You make it
[35:13] easy to minister. And uh and I need
[35:16] that. I need that. While you're
[35:18] standing, just go with me over to the
[35:19] book of Luke, the 20th chapter.
[35:24] I told them when I got off the airplane
[35:26] Monday, I said, "I must have got on the
[35:27] wrong plane because this can't be
[35:29] Phoenix." It was cooled. I thought,
[35:32] "This is great. If y'all could just
[35:33] petition to get this, you know, for
[35:35] several months, it'd be wonderful." But
[35:38] I understand it's supposed to change.
[35:41] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. We're
[35:43] going to Luke the 20th chapter and then
[35:45] we're also going to go over to 2
[35:47] Corinthians the 3rd
[35:50] chapter for one
[35:53] verse. Luke the 20th chapter. And the
[35:56] chief priest and the scribes the same
[35:59] hour sought to lay hands on him. They
[36:03] feared the people for they perceived
[36:06] that he had spoken this parable against
[36:07] him. Jesus had just spoken the parable
[36:09] about the vineyard and the man who had
[36:11] bought the vineyard and led it out to
[36:12] husband and then took his journey to a
[36:15] far country and then he came again and
[36:17] they slayed his servants. They slayed
[36:19] his son. And so they're they're saying,
[36:21] "Hey, he's he's spoke this
[36:24] parable against us."
[36:26] And so they watched him and sent forth
[36:29] spies which should fain themselves just
[36:31] men that they might take hold his word
[36:34] so that they might deliver him unto the
[36:36] power and the authority of the governor.
[36:39] And down in the 22nd verse it says it
[36:42] lawful for us to give tribute unto
[36:46] Caesar or no. So here's a trick
[36:49] question.
[36:51] But he perceived their craftiness, and
[36:53] said unto them, Why tempt you me? Show
[36:56] me a penny, whose image and
[36:57] superscription have it? And they
[36:59] answered and said, Caesars. And he said
[37:00] unto them, render unto Caesar the things
[37:03] that which are which be Caesars's, and
[37:05] unto God the things which be God's. Now
[37:08] over in 2 Corinthians the third
[37:10] chapter, one verse there, 2 Corinthians
[37:13] the third
[37:15] chapter, one verse.
[37:18] the third verse and it says, "For as
[37:20] much as you are manifestly declared to
[37:24] be the epistles of Christ, ministered by
[37:26] us, written not with ink, but with the
[37:29] spirit of the living God, not in tables
[37:30] of stone, but in fleshly tables of the
[37:33] heart." Let's just bow our hearts
[37:34] tonight. Heavenly Father, we just come
[37:36] given honor and glory and praise, Lord,
[37:38] for the privilege that we have, dear
[37:40] Lord, to to come to worship you, dear
[37:42] Lord, to exalt you, to magnify you,
[37:44] Lord, to to just take your word, dear
[37:46] God, and and to be able to feed upon
[37:48] your word. And we're just asking
[37:49] tonight, dear Lord, that you would speak
[37:50] your word to each individual that's
[37:52] here. You know each need. You know each
[37:54] heart, each situation, Lord, the
[37:56] questions that may be on someone's mind,
[37:58] the pain or the suffering that someone
[37:59] else is dealing with, dear Lord. And we
[38:01] believe that you're able to minister to
[38:03] each of these needs for your glory,
[38:05] Lord. And that God, it would bring glory
[38:07] to you. Wouldn't not that I should
[38:09] receive glory, but Lord, that your name
[38:10] would be exalted and magnified, dear
[38:13] Lord Jesus, among the saints. We thank
[38:15] you. We praise. We ask all these things
[38:17] in your precious name. Amen. And a
[38:19] church said, "Amen." God bless you may
[38:21] be seated tonight. Thank you, brother.
[38:24] You supposed to be back there in the
[38:25] congregation with your wife. He told me,
[38:27] "I'm going to go see." So, I'm going to
[38:28] go sit with Sister Sandy. So, all right.
[38:31] Okay. Not that I'm running him off, but
[38:33] you know, I look back and he's he's
[38:35] still there and he told me he was going.
[38:37] It's hey, it's his pull pit. He can be
[38:39] anywhere he wants to be. Praise the
[38:42] Lord. I want to take a thought tonight
[38:43] if I could from these couple of places
[38:46] that I that we've that we've read here
[38:49] on manifested image. Now, just a small
[38:52] thought tonight, not big. Hopefully,
[38:53] we'll be out of here quickly, so I I
[38:55] won't drag this out. But we read this
[38:58] story here, this of Jesus whenever the
[39:00] the chief priest and the scribe, they're
[39:02] coming and they're, you know, they they
[39:04] hate Jesus. They hate what he is and
[39:07] they're trying to find occasion against
[39:09] him to try to uh uh uh try to entrap
[39:12] him, you know, that they may, as it says
[39:14] in that 20th verse, that they may
[39:15] deliver him under the power and the
[39:17] authority of the governor. So they're
[39:18] asking that question, you know, is it
[39:21] lawful to give tribute unto Caesar or
[39:23] no? So, it's a it's definitely a trick
[39:25] question that they're asking him because
[39:27] if Jesus said no, then they would hand
[39:30] him over to the authorities as a Roman
[39:32] trader. But if he simply says yes to
[39:35] this question, then he would be deemed a
[39:38] traitor to the Jews. So, you know, you
[39:40] you maybe you've been asked those
[39:42] questions before. Somebody put you in
[39:43] that tight spot that you know, no matter
[39:46] what you answer, it looks like there's
[39:48] just not a good answer, right? That
[39:50] somebody's going to take it the wrong
[39:51] way. somebody's going to make the wrong
[39:53] thing out of it. People do that, right?
[39:56] And so that's what they're trying to do
[39:57] to Jesus. But as the scripture says
[39:59] here, he perceived their deceptiveness.
[40:01] He perceived what they were trying to do
[40:04] against him. And he says, "Okay, show me
[40:07] a penny, a Roma dinari, whatever it
[40:09] might have been." He says, "Whose image
[40:11] and supercription have it?" And they
[40:13] said, "It's got Caesars." And so they he
[40:15] took that penny and they looked at it.
[40:17] They were very versed with it. They knew
[40:19] what it was. They knew that it had the
[40:21] image of Caesar on it. They knew that it
[40:23] had a superscription to Caesar on it.
[40:26] And Jesus made this statement. He says,
[40:28] "Render therefore unto Caesars the
[40:31] things which belong to Caesar, which be
[40:34] Caesars, and to God the things which be
[40:36] God's." Amen. Now, you know what is kind
[40:38] of amazing about that when you think
[40:40] about it is, you know, Jesus, he didn't
[40:42] have to he didn't have to analyze he
[40:45] didn't ask him to analyze the alloy of
[40:47] that coin to see who it belonged to. He
[40:50] didn't say, you know, hey, you know,
[40:52] let's let's research this thing. Maybe
[40:54] we should go ask a tax collector,
[40:56] somebody that is an expert in the field.
[40:58] He didn't say those things. He said,
[40:59] just show me and tell me whose image it
[41:02] is bearing. Yes. and you'll know who it
[41:06] belongs to
[41:08] by the image that it is bearing. Right.
[41:11] And you know I thought Lord how true
[41:14] that is not just of a coin
[41:18] but of an individual as us as
[41:20] individuals. What image are we bearing?
[41:22] You know what are we showing? The word
[41:24] image here from the uh from the Greek
[41:26] comes from the word econ which we have
[41:28] our word icon. Icon we we all know what
[41:32] an icon is. It is as the definition
[41:35] there is one in whom the likeness of
[41:37] anyone is seen. And you know if if if I
[41:42] you know told you showed you the big
[41:44] swoop swoosh or whatever that thing's
[41:47] called swoosh then I listen right here.
[41:51] You know I should be looking around for
[41:52] some tennis shoes or something. But if I
[41:54] told you you know if I showed you that
[41:55] image you know immediately that that
[41:57] that swoosh that it represented Nike.
[42:01] You know, if you if I showed you the
[42:03] icon or the corporate logo for
[42:05] Chevrolet, the the bow tie, you would
[42:08] automatically say, "Well, that's
[42:09] represents Chevrolet." You wouldn't have
[42:10] to see a word. You wouldn't have to, you
[42:12] know, you wouldn't have to research it.
[42:13] You've seen it. So, you can identify
[42:16] something by an image, right? I mean,
[42:18] you you know that you don't have to have
[42:19] the words that goes with it. You just
[42:21] see the image and automatically you know
[42:24] already what that identifies with in in
[42:26] many many cases. Now, I worked in
[42:28] corporate America for 31 years.
[42:31] work for Lowe's in their corporate
[42:32] offices and and uh you know I've been
[42:35] retired for 10 years now and you can go
[42:37] to my closet brother Mark and in my
[42:40] closet are still several shirts and hats
[42:43] and coats and whatever that bears Lowe's
[42:46] corporate logo on that and you know I
[42:49] wear those things and that would
[42:50] identify me with Lowe's and so somebody
[42:52] come up and they start talking about
[42:53] Lowe's and they'd tell me about the
[42:55] terrible experience that they had that
[42:57] are the the crooked tub before that they
[43:00] bought bought at Lowe's, you know. I
[43:01] said, "Yeah, me too." You know, I I get
[43:03] the same thing. I buy I buy the same
[43:05] cricket 24 as you buy. I don't get
[43:06] special two4s cuz I I work for
[43:11] Lowe's. Or somebody come along and they
[43:13] want, you know, maybe they want a
[43:15] discount or whatever, you know, but I
[43:17] was
[43:18] identified with them because of that
[43:21] clothing or whatever that I that I wear.
[43:23] And so you know you you know the image
[43:26] that you're that you're manifest it
[43:28] identifies us with something right I
[43:30] mean you you know that I mean this is
[43:32] elementary this is not difficult it's
[43:33] not hard uh but you recognize a lot of
[43:36] times those those icons and funny story
[43:39] happened several years ago I don't know
[43:40] if I mentioned this here I don't know
[43:41] why I would have but I'm old I don't
[43:44] know what I told you and what I didn't
[43:45] tell you but years ago I've got a a
[43:48] precious wonderful father-in-law Avery
[43:51] Ror one of the most godly men honest one
[43:53] of the most godly people you'll ever
[43:55] meet. Precious, precious mother. But he
[43:57] loves a
[43:59] bargain. I
[44:01] mean, you know, you going to get him
[44:03] excited. You know, talk about a bargain.
[44:05] So, he is out one time and he was out
[44:07] yard selling and he bought a a a bunch
[44:09] of neck
[44:11] ties for a dollar. And we were over at
[44:14] his house. This been a few years ago.
[44:15] And and he was he was showing us those
[44:18] neck ties and oh, this is beautiful neck
[44:20] tie. And just be honest with you,
[44:22] they're all out of style for the most
[44:24] part. You know, he loved to bargain, but
[44:26] he didn't know a whole lot about style
[44:27] and fashion and so forth. And he was
[44:29] showing us those neck ties and beautiful
[44:31] and different ones. And he gets down to
[44:33] one of Solid Brand said, "This is one's
[44:34] my favorite." And I'm kidding you not,
[44:38] it had a Playboy bunny on
[44:41] it. He's a pastor of the church. He's a
[44:44] preacher of the message, but he didn't
[44:46] know what it was. He didn't know what
[44:48] that represented. And you know, I had to
[44:50] tell him. I wish I hadn't told him. I
[44:52] wish I'd let him wear it at the
[44:54] church, you know, cuz he had no clue
[44:56] what that cute little bunny
[44:59] represented. And uh but you know, I I I
[45:01] I told him, "Amen." But you know, you
[45:04] can identify those those things, right?
[45:06] I mean, you know, you see these
[45:08] different things and and you identify
[45:10] what they are. And a lot of times, you
[45:12] know, you see people that wear around
[45:13] they got a cross on their neck or they
[45:16] got a cross little pin pined on them or,
[45:18] you know, you you can see a wrapper with
[45:20] a big chain around their neck and a big
[45:22] cross on it. But you know, those things
[45:23] do not make them a Christian. Just
[45:26] because they're wearing a cross, amen,
[45:29] just because maybe they go somewhere to
[45:30] church, that doesn't make them a
[45:32] Christian, right? What image are they
[45:34] bearing? Amen. You know the scripture
[45:36] tells us as Paul was writing over there
[45:38] to Titus the first chapter the 16th
[45:40] verse said they profess that they know
[45:42] God but in works
[45:45] in works what they're manifesting what
[45:48] they're living what they're producing it
[45:50] denies what they say and I said God
[45:53] forbid we should not be that way right
[45:56] our life ought to back up what we claim
[45:58] that we are amen we should we should
[46:01] manifest Jesus Christ said he he goes on
[46:04] said be abominable and disobedient unto
[46:06] every good work reprobate. So, you know
[46:08] what? It's abominable for someone to
[46:10] say, "Hey, I'm identified with Jesus
[46:12] Christ, but yet they manifest the image
[46:14] of the world." And but so, you know,
[46:16] sometimes we we get confused with these
[46:18] things. We don't think about these
[46:19] things. We we we allow these things
[46:22] maybe to come over us or or you know,
[46:25] the things of the world look nice, they
[46:27] look good and and we get caught up in
[46:29] those things not real realizing the
[46:31] image that it is producing to someone
[46:33] else. what is being manifested to
[46:35] somebody else. In that 2 Corinthians the
[46:38] third
[46:39] chapter that we read that third verse
[46:42] said for as much as ye are manifestally
[46:45] declared are declared by manifestation.
[46:49] It's declared by manifestation that you
[46:51] are the epistle of Christ minister by
[46:53] us. Say amen. So we declare what we are
[46:56] by what we manifest. The image we
[46:59] manifest declares who we belong to.
[47:01] That's what Jesus said. Whose image is
[47:03] on that coin? It's Caesar's. Okay. It
[47:05] belongs to Caesar. If it is bearing the
[47:07] image of Caesar, it belongs to to
[47:10] Caesar. If it's bearing the image of the
[47:12] world
[47:13] if it's manifesting the image of Jesus
[47:16] Christ, I mean, you see these things. I
[47:18] mean, so you know, people can dress a
[47:20] certain way uh to identify with
[47:23] something. I remember I was years ago I
[47:25] was up in Boston and the I was working
[47:28] with an engineer group and they said,
[47:30] "Hey, you know, here after work, we got
[47:32] tickets to go down to watch the Red Sox
[47:34] and I didn't care a thing about the Red
[47:35] Sox, but I said, "Okay, I'll go with
[47:37] you." And so we we walked we parked and
[47:40] we walked start walking toward the
[47:42] stadium and all this stuff. And we
[47:43] turned a corner. And we turned a corner
[47:46] the whole opposite side of the street.
[47:47] All the way down the block and down the
[47:49] next block. Here was this group of of uh
[47:53] young people all dressed in black. Black
[47:56] leather. Their hair was black. Their
[47:59] nails were painted black. Their lips
[48:01] were painted black. You know, well, I
[48:03] didn't have to cross the street to ask
[48:05] them what they identified with. I knew
[48:07] that it was a goth group. I knew that
[48:09] they they were into the Gothic scene and
[48:12] all those things. And I want to tell you
[48:13] something, I wasn't crossing the street.
[48:15] I was staying as far away from that
[48:16] crowd as I could cuz you could feel the
[48:19] you could feel the spirit that was
[48:20] identified with. But see, I didn't have
[48:22] to go ask them. You Well, who are you
[48:24] identifying with? You know, you see
[48:26] somebody dressed up in their their
[48:28] cowboy boots and their blue jeans and
[48:29] all these things and you know, who are
[48:31] they identifying with? What are they?
[48:33] I'm not knocking those. Yeah, don't be
[48:35] like the Gothic. But you know, sometimes
[48:37] you see that, right? You know, if I
[48:39] walked out here and I was wearing a
[48:41] fireman's suit, you'd be going like,
[48:43] "What are you doing? You're supposed to
[48:45] be a preacher of the gospel." Amen. Not
[48:46] a fireman or whatever. Amen. We're here
[48:49] to start fires, not put them
[48:51] out. Okay? That's the idea. It's to
[48:54] start a fire, not to put it out. Right?
[48:56] Amen. So, but you can identify somebody
[48:59] by that image that they're manifesting,
[49:01] how they're dressing, and and so forth.
[49:03] So if somebody's dressing like the
[49:05] world, right? What are they identifying
[49:07] with? Very good. What are they
[49:09] manifesting? What is what is people
[49:11] seeing in them? In fact, it says in
[49:13] first Peter the first chapter the 14th
[49:15] verse says this. And as obedient
[49:17] children, not fashioning yourselves
[49:20] according to the form of lust in your
[49:22] ignorance. And so we're not supposed to,
[49:24] you know, there's a time that we were
[49:26] ignorant. My father-in-law was ignorant
[49:27] of the Playboy
[49:29] Bunny. He shouldn't be anymore, right?
[49:32] He's probably forgotten that was a long
[49:33] time ago. But uh you know not fashioning
[49:36] yourselves the way maybe you once lived
[49:38] the things you once did that were once
[49:40] okay. You know you're not fashion
[49:42] yourself that. You're not fashion
[49:43] yourselves like the world. Amen. You
[49:45] don't you don't fashion yourself one way
[49:47] to come to church on Sunday and another
[49:49] way to go to school or to go to work on
[49:51] Monday.
[49:53] Right? That that would be a makeeliever.
[49:54] We you know that that fashion is
[49:56] identified as a makebeliever. But but so
[49:58] you're not fashioning yourselves
[50:00] according to the form of lust these
[50:01] other things. And that word fashion is
[50:03] to conform to the to some pattern or the
[50:06] same pattern. Fashion yourselves
[50:08] according to something else. And so
[50:10] we're not doing that. Amen. You have to
[50:12] wonder sometimes when you see these
[50:14] fashions that the world is is
[50:17] manifesting, where did those fashions
[50:19] come from? Where did where did skinny
[50:20] jeans come from? Who got the idea I'm
[50:23] going to wear my pants really really
[50:25] tight?
[50:26] Not a not a well-rounded preacher.
[50:30] not a well-rounded preacher like me. Oh,
[50:32] no, no, no, no, no. That's the father.
[50:34] But, you know, sometimes you you have to
[50:36] ask yourself, you know, you sisters,
[50:38] before you put on a tight, you know,
[50:39] tight clothes, what is this manifesting?
[50:43] Who's this identifying with before you
[50:45] put on mascara, who is this identifying
[50:48] with, brothers? before you, you know,
[50:50] uh, you get your mop head haircut,
[50:55] you know, they anymore, they said,
[50:58] "Well, you know, it's short on the sides
[50:59] and so forth, but up here it's it's all
[51:02] mopped up. I got a young man come to our
[51:03] church and he's not a Christian. He's
[51:05] been in church all his life, but he's
[51:06] just not a Christian." And most time
[51:09] when he walks seeing, you can only see
[51:10] him from here down. I do not know how he
[51:13] sees where he's going. I do not know. I
[51:15] mean, you know, and and I hate it. I
[51:18] hate it. But I know that if if if I put
[51:20] him in a corner that, you know, he'll
[51:22] just he'll quit and not come back. So I,
[51:24] you know, I just keep on preaching.
[51:25] Lord, just just convict him. Amen. Cuz
[51:28] but a lot of people get this idea, well,
[51:29] it's short here, so you know, it doesn't
[51:31] matter that it looks like I got a mop
[51:33] stuck on top of my head if it's short on
[51:35] the side. But who is what is that image?
[51:38] Where did that come from? You know, he
[51:40] talked about these men and I don't I
[51:42] don't know if they're popular still
[51:43] anymore or not, but they used to wear
[51:44] they used to, you know, wear their saggy
[51:46] pants and so forth, you know, have their
[51:48] pants sagging way down. So, and
[51:50] understand that come from prison, right?
[51:53] You know what I'm talking about, right?
[51:54] Well, I don't want to be identified with
[51:56] that, right? I mean, we that's God has
[51:58] not called us to be identified with the
[52:00] things of the world, but be separate.
[52:03] Being different. Amen. It's all right to
[52:05] be different. It's all right. Amen. If
[52:08] we are oddballs in this age, I'd hate
[52:10] not to be an oddball in this age. I'd
[52:12] hate to to be mistaken for the world in
[52:15] this age that we're living in.
[52:17] Somebody's talked I was talking to
[52:19] somebody the other day and I talking
[52:20] about some of the places they were going
[52:21] to and and and and that that places that
[52:24] played bluegrass music and all this
[52:26] stuff. And I said I said, "Brother, I
[52:28] want to tell you something. when I was
[52:30] working, you know, and I'd go to these
[52:31] uh meeting with developers and
[52:34] contractors and all this stuff and we'd
[52:36] go out to eat or whatever and we were
[52:38] negotiating and they'd order wine and
[52:40] all these things and they'd be
[52:42] especially up in the northeast there
[52:43] every other word's a curse word. And I
[52:45] said, and I want to tell you something.
[52:47] I said it it was not my choice to go
[52:49] there. It was a part of my job, but I
[52:53] never ever was comfortable in that
[52:55] atmosphere. Amen. And you should be
[52:58] scared if if you can dive into the
[53:00] things of the world and you're
[53:02] comfortable in the things of the world.
[53:04] You we a believer should never just be
[53:06] comfortable out here in a pig pin. Amen.
[53:08] That's not where we belong. Brother
[53:10] Brandham talked about, you know, said it
[53:11] wouldn't surprise me at all if I drove
[53:13] down the road and seen a a pig on a on a
[53:15] manure pile eating manure. But he said
[53:17] if I ever seen his sheep, you know,
[53:20] because we shouldn't that's that's not
[53:21] who we are, right? Amen. So, we need to
[53:24] be we need to guard what we do. Amen. We
[53:27] need to guard where we go. We need to gu
[53:29] be on guard. Be sober. Be vigilant for
[53:32] your adversary, the devil. He's looking
[53:34] for that opportunity. He's looking for a
[53:37] place to try to come in into an
[53:39] individual's life. Amen. A scripture,
[53:42] you know, the scripture very well. These
[53:43] are these are familiar scriptures to
[53:45] you. Amen. Romans the se the 12th
[53:48] chapter, the second verse says, "And be
[53:50] not conformed to this world.
[53:55] Now, I'd like I'd love just to ask some
[53:58] denominational Christians, what does
[53:59] that right there mean to you?
[54:02] Whenever you're when you dress like
[54:04] everybody else, you look like everybody
[54:06] else. What does that scripture right
[54:07] there mean to you? Be not conformed to
[54:10] this world, but be transformed to the
[54:11] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[54:13] what is good and acceptable and perfect
[54:15] will of God. Amen. So, what we're
[54:16] conforming to again proves who we're
[54:18] serving. Amen. And so, we're not
[54:20] supposed to conform to the world. Our
[54:21] music shouldn't conform to the world.
[54:23] Our fashion shouldn't conform to the
[54:24] world. We're supposed to be different.
[54:26] Amen. And I believe that as dark a as
[54:29] the darkness continues to take over,
[54:32] Amen. Your light is going to shine
[54:34] brighter. Amen. Your difference is going
[54:38] to be magnified. Right. Amen. We we know
[54:41] that here uh the the the Pope just
[54:43] passed away and they're in a conclave
[54:45] now trying to figure out who's who's
[54:47] going to be that next and and and hope
[54:49] for the last one. and could be the
[54:52] manifestation h of the antichrist in our
[54:56] age. Amen. The the embodiment. We, you
[54:59] know, that's what we're looking at. But
[55:00] but you know, this this Pope Francis
[55:03] when he passed away, the LGBT community,
[55:06] they were they honored
[55:08] him. They honored him because he was the
[55:11] first pope, a man, that opened up the
[55:13] doors for homosexuality in the Catholic
[55:16] Church and saying it was acceptable and
[55:17] okay. You know, again, the later it
[55:20] gets, the closer we get to leaving, the
[55:24] darker the world is going to be, the
[55:26] brighter you should shine, the bigger
[55:29] the difference is going to be. You know,
[55:30] be like if I was up here and I lit a
[55:32] match, well, you know, you wouldn't even
[55:34] hardly notice the light of that match in
[55:36] this brightly lit room. But if you
[55:38] turned out all the lights, then every
[55:40] eye would see the brightness of just
[55:43] that little old match. And that's what
[55:44] you and I are supposed to be in this
[55:47] hour. Amen. That people can see
[55:50] something different in us. Praise God.
[55:53] And I say, Lord, do do the work on me.
[55:55] Amen. Do the work in my life. But see
[55:57] what it is is humanity doesn't want to
[56:01] change to conform to God's image. We
[56:05] want to change the image of God. We want
[56:07] to bring the image of God down. Amen. To
[56:10] be like us. It's, you know, Romans the
[56:13] first chapter the 23rd verse and it
[56:15] says, "And changed the glory of the
[56:17] incorruptible God into an image made
[56:21] like to corruptible man and to birds and
[56:23] to forfeited beasts and creeping
[56:25] things." I mean, so you know what?
[56:26] Instead of us, you know, we want to
[56:27] bring God down to our level instead of
[56:30] us we we can't get up to God's level.
[56:32] So, let's just let's just bring God down
[56:34] to our level that everything is okay or
[56:36] whatever. But, you know, you know, they
[56:38] weren't like God. They weren't like the
[56:40] word. And so they changed the image of
[56:42] the word. They changed the image of God.
[56:46] And and I I've lost count how many
[56:50] English translations there
[56:52] are of this book. That's right. I know
[56:56] that there's well over a hundred English
[57:00] translations of this book. I mean, it
[57:03] may be up in the hundreds now. I don't
[57:05] know. At one time it was it was 104, but
[57:08] I know it's it's a lot higher than that.
[57:09] Everybody's got their verse. Everybody's
[57:11] got their translations. You know, let's
[57:13] let's take out the the gender of it.
[57:17] Yes. Right. Amen. So, they've got all
[57:18] these different things. Amen. So, what
[57:20] they're doing is they're trying to
[57:21] change the image of God to suit them.
[57:25] Right. Amen. To become what they want it
[57:27] to be. Now, here's the thing is you've
[57:29] got to realize is that that Satan also
[57:32] has an image. That's right. Satan has an
[57:36] image and he wants to manifest that
[57:39] image. You, you know, you've seen some
[57:40] of these people that, you know, they go
[57:42] tattooed all over and they get implants
[57:45] where looks like maybe they got horns
[57:47] and, you know, they got their tongue
[57:49] that is split and they got piercings
[57:50] everywhere. And what is that? What in
[57:53] world would would cause someone that had
[57:56] a that was in their right mind to to to
[57:59] manifest that to to to portray that,
[58:02] right? you know that it has to be a
[58:04] spirit that is on the inside of that
[58:06] individual that is trying to manifest
[58:08] itself that's manifesting that image.
[58:11] Amen. And and and it just takes on that
[58:14] hideous look at Satan is trying to
[58:16] manifest himself greater in this hour
[58:19] than ever before.
[58:22] Oh my. So he's doing that. We know the
[58:25] the image of the the beast and so forth.
[58:27] Revelations the 19th chapter and it said
[58:29] that the beast was taken and him and
[58:31] with him the false prophet that wrought
[58:33] miracles before him with which he
[58:36] deceived them that had received the mark
[58:38] of the beast and them that worshiped his
[58:42] image. These both were cast alive in a
[58:45] lake of burning with fire and brimstone.
[58:47] So here it is. You know there's there's
[58:49] an image and people worship that image.
[58:52] Now that image, Amen. The or the word
[58:54] worship here, if you look this up in the
[58:57] Greek, you'll find out that it we
[58:58] talking about the pope, it says to kiss
[59:00] the
[59:01] hand. Worship here referenced in this
[59:05] book verse talking about that it is to
[59:08] kiss the hand.
[59:11] Who you know if you go in to see the
[59:13] pope, you're supposed to kiss the ring,
[59:16] right? Brother Brandon wouldn't he
[59:18] wouldn't go in to see the pope because
[59:19] he wouldn't get to bow down and kiss the
[59:21] ring. Amen. That was God that was
[59:23] preventing him. Amen. From going into
[59:25] that place. But here's the mark of the
[59:27] beast. Amen. The image of the beast. The
[59:29] mark is something that is carved or
[59:32] sculpt fashioned like uh uh into a form
[59:35] of something. So Satan wants to manifest
[59:38] his image through humanity today. and
[59:42] people that are taking on the image of
[59:45] not not just when I'm talking about
[59:47] somebody that is tattooed and and and
[59:49] got horn implants in and all this stuff,
[59:51] but the world looking like Satan. Amen.
[59:55] They're they're they're they're coming
[59:57] into that. Amen. They're they're coming
[59:59] into that place of worship of that.
[1:00:02] Brother Beam said in the message, turn
[1:00:04] on the light. He said, "One of these
[1:00:05] days something's going to happen. It's
[1:00:07] going to be too late. The people will
[1:00:09] take on the mark of the beast not even
[1:00:11] knowing what they're doing. They're not
[1:00:14] even going to know. Amen. And he says
[1:00:16] this in multiple places. They're not
[1:00:17] even going to they're going to take it.
[1:00:19] Amen. And he talked about you sitting in
[1:00:21] a trinitarian doctrine and these
[1:00:23] different things. Amen. That people were
[1:00:24] they were accepting that and they didn't
[1:00:26] even recognize what they were coming
[1:00:28] into. Amen. And so if they can take the
[1:00:30] mark of the beast without knowing it,
[1:00:32] they can also worship then the image of
[1:00:34] the beast without knowing it. That's
[1:00:36] right. Right. Amen. They can they can
[1:00:39] they can take on that image
[1:00:42] without knowing it. Right. And see
[1:00:44] that's what's happening in the world is
[1:00:46] they're taking on the image. They're
[1:00:48] worshiping the image. Amen. It's t of
[1:00:51] the image of God. It's it's become
[1:00:53] Satan's
[1:00:54] manifestation in this hour. And people
[1:00:57] are conforming to that. Religion is
[1:00:59] conforming to that. Secular Christianity
[1:01:02] is conforming to that. Amen. They're
[1:01:04] becoming more like that. Brother Bam
[1:01:06] said in the message the token he says
[1:01:08] this different places he says you say
[1:01:10] what about the mark of the beast those
[1:01:12] who reject the holy ghost is already
[1:01:13] marked by the beast the punishment will
[1:01:15] come later see it he said hey whenever
[1:01:18] all of a sudden the holy ghost you pour
[1:01:19] out said so did the mark of the beast
[1:01:21] amen because they started rejecting it
[1:01:24] and by rejecting it they were taking the
[1:01:25] mark of the beast and to reject amen to
[1:01:28] to defame or refuse that holy ghost the
[1:01:32] holy spirit amen then it becomes amen
[1:01:35] the unpardonable sin. I mean, so they
[1:01:37] were taking the mark of the beast. They
[1:01:39] didn't even realize what was going on,
[1:01:41] what was happening. Amen. But we're
[1:01:43] living in an age that God has given us
[1:01:46] revelation. He has given us truth. Amen.
[1:01:48] That we're not supposed to be deceived
[1:01:51] by these things that are happening.
[1:01:53] Amen. That we're not conforming to the
[1:01:55] image of the world, but that God is
[1:01:57] working on us. He's doing a work. He's
[1:02:00] changing us, right? God is He's doing a
[1:02:03] work changing us. I mean, I hope I hope
[1:02:05] you can say, "Yeah, he's changing me."
[1:02:07] Amen. I'm Thank God I'm not what I used
[1:02:10] to be. I may not be what I ought to be,
[1:02:12] but I'm not what I used to be. Praise
[1:02:14] the Lord. That's the way it should be.
[1:02:16] Amen. Maybe there's still things in your
[1:02:18] life, Amen, that need to be corrected or
[1:02:20] need to be worked on, but thank God
[1:02:22] you're not what you used to be. Amen.
[1:02:24] You're not in the things that you used
[1:02:26] to be into. Amen. So, God is doing the
[1:02:28] work of changing us. And Colossians the
[1:02:31] 3
[1:02:32] chapter the 8th verse says but now you
[1:02:36] also put off these but now ye also put
[1:02:39] off all these anger, wrath, malice,
[1:02:42] blasphemy, filthy communication out of
[1:02:43] your mouth. Lie not one another and see
[1:02:45] that ye have put off the old man with
[1:02:47] his deeds and have put on the new man
[1:02:50] which is renewed, made new in knowledge
[1:02:54] after the image of him that created him.
[1:02:58] And so there's a change that takes
[1:02:59] place. Yeah. Once I once I I I acted
[1:03:02] like the world, I talked like the world.
[1:03:04] I I enjoyed the things of the world. I
[1:03:06] was in the world. Amen. I wasn't raised
[1:03:08] in the message. I was raid raised a a
[1:03:11] Methodist. And I did every dirty rotten
[1:03:13] thing that I could find to do in the in
[1:03:14] the little bitty nowhere town uh of
[1:03:17] Rugby, USA. Amen. You know, he was I I
[1:03:21] so and I enjoyed. I looked for that.
[1:03:23] Amen. But thank God one day, Amen. there
[1:03:26] come a change in my life. Amen. And I
[1:03:29] could no longer go back to those things.
[1:03:31] Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he
[1:03:33] is a new a new creature, a new creation,
[1:03:37] a new species. The old things, amen, are
[1:03:40] passed away. Behold, all things become
[1:03:42] new. The things that I once were
[1:03:44] involved in the ones I was attracted to,
[1:03:47] the image that I once tried to manifest.
[1:03:50] Amen. Now, all that was being changed.
[1:03:53] Amen. And it was the change was taking
[1:03:56] place in my life. Praise God. He was
[1:03:58] doing a work in me. And it was I was
[1:04:00] being made new in
[1:04:03] knowledge. Renew in your mind. Not being
[1:04:05] conformed to this world, but being
[1:04:06] transformed, but the renewal of your
[1:04:08] mind in the knowledge after the image of
[1:04:11] him that created him. Amen. So human
[1:04:14] knowledge is flawed.
[1:04:19] I I without a doubt you can date some of
[1:04:21] these young people that's been around
[1:04:23] the message and they can explain
[1:04:25] everything to
[1:04:26] you, but yet they
[1:04:29] still aren't in that image because
[1:04:32] they're doing it with a flawed. They're
[1:04:33] trying to do it with a flawed knowledge.
[1:04:36] But God has to do a change. There has to
[1:04:38] be a change that takes place on the
[1:04:41] inside of us for us to bear the image of
[1:04:44] Christ. Amen. He does the work. Now,
[1:04:47] Romans 8:29, I love this verse. One of
[1:04:50] my favorite verses. For whom he did
[1:04:53] forno, he also did
[1:04:56] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:04:58] image of his son that he might be the
[1:05:01] first born among many brethren. Amen.
[1:05:04] So, he predestinated us to be conformed
[1:05:07] to the image of Jesus Christ. Amen. That
[1:05:10] was Christ is the pattern. The word is
[1:05:13] the pattern. He's the standard. He's
[1:05:16] what we're He's what we're aiming for
[1:05:17] him. You you you're not aiming to be
[1:05:20] like Lindsey McGra. You're aiming You're
[1:05:22] aiming is to be the manifested word,
[1:05:24] right? Is the word in this hour. Praise
[1:05:27] God. Is to come into his image. Praise
[1:05:30] God. And not just the image of the world
[1:05:32] and not the things of the world. And the
[1:05:34] things of the world that h are in us,
[1:05:36] they should be they those things should
[1:05:39] be falling away from us. Praise God.
[1:05:42] Amen. Amen. I don't know why the Lord
[1:05:44] led me this direction. Maybe maybe the
[1:05:46] devil's been tempting you to to dabble
[1:05:48] with the things of the world. Amen.
[1:05:50] Well, I'm telling you, don't do it.
[1:05:51] Amen. Because when Satan can convince
[1:05:53] you, Amen. to start taking on the things
[1:05:56] of the world, a little bit here and a
[1:05:58] little bit there, all of a sudden he's
[1:05:59] painting the picture of you. Amen.
[1:06:02] You're on his eel and he's painting the
[1:06:04] picture. He's putting his image on you
[1:06:07] instead of the image of almighty God.
[1:06:09] Second Peter the uh the 1st chapter the
[1:06:11] fourth verse says whereby given us
[1:06:13] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:06:16] that's the
[1:06:18] word that by these ye might be partakers
[1:06:22] of the divine nature having escaped the
[1:06:25] corruption that is in the world through
[1:06:26] lust. Amen. So here's the divine and
[1:06:28] that divine in the Greek is whatever can
[1:06:31] in any aspect be liked like li like li
[1:06:33] like li like li like li like li like li
[1:06:33] like li like li like li like li like li
[1:06:34] like li like li like li like li like li
[1:06:34] like li like li like li like like unto
[1:06:34] God or resembles him in any way and to
[1:06:38] be a partaker is to share you're sharing
[1:06:41] in that very nature amen it is given us
[1:06:45] this this word is given unto us amen to
[1:06:49] bring us into the image of Jesus Christ
[1:06:52] praise God the promises God these the
[1:06:55] the revelation of this promised word to
[1:06:58] produce a divine image of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:01] Amen. That's what that's what we're
[1:07:03] looking for. Amen. That we, you know,
[1:07:04] that we might be identified with him.
[1:07:07] Amen. Not identified with the world.
[1:07:09] Praise the Lord. You know, listen, a
[1:07:12] little word, a little word with the
[1:07:16] traditions of man produces a
[1:07:18] Baptist, a
[1:07:20] Methodist, a Pentecostal.
[1:07:23] A megaurch believer. That's the big
[1:07:26] thing today
[1:07:27] is the mega church, right? All these
[1:07:29] mega churches popping up out here. Amen.
[1:07:32] Where the the pastor gets up in his
[1:07:34] tennis shoes and his blue jeans. I hope
[1:07:36] Brother Ron's not doing F. I am. Forgive
[1:07:38] me, brother. But you know, that's what
[1:07:40] they're doing, right? You know, and so
[1:07:43] Amen. But that's that's what a a little
[1:07:46] word Yeah. with a lot of tradition of
[1:07:49] men will produce exactly that. Amen.
[1:07:52] It's kind of like if you if we took a
[1:07:53] puzzle, if I if I had a piece of puzzle
[1:07:55] up here, I could I could hand that piece
[1:07:57] of puzzle around some somebody tells me
[1:07:59] what the picture what this what this
[1:08:00] puzzle is. Well, you couldn't
[1:08:03] identify what that piece of the pu or
[1:08:06] from that one piece of puzzle what the
[1:08:09] puzzle is, right? I mean, you you
[1:08:12] couldn't do it. I mean, you look at that
[1:08:13] one piece, you know, one person say,
[1:08:14] "Well, you know, it's going to be a
[1:08:16] picture of some clouds in the sky." No,
[1:08:17] no, no, it's water and waves. and
[1:08:20] somebody say, "No, it's a car."
[1:08:22] Whatever. You know, you you'd have all
[1:08:23] your ideas, but you couldn't you
[1:08:24] couldn't make it out from that one
[1:08:26] little piece. Amen. But all of a sudden,
[1:08:28] you start taking multiple pieces. Amen.
[1:08:31] Now, you know, you could take multiple
[1:08:33] pieces and you could take pieces from
[1:08:35] another puzzle
[1:08:38] and start trying to put them together
[1:08:40] and you still are not going to get the
[1:08:42] right picture. In fact, they're not even
[1:08:44] going to fit together. Right. Right.
[1:08:47] They're they're not they're not going to
[1:08:48] they're not going to you're not going to
[1:08:49] get a picture. Amen. But you got to take
[1:08:52] amen the the full puzzle, the revealed
[1:08:56] puzzle. Amen. That the pieces are are
[1:08:58] revealed. Amen. And then it begins to
[1:09:01] make the picture. Praise God. You begin
[1:09:03] to see the picture and what it what it
[1:09:05] is manifesting. Amen. What is becoming
[1:09:08] and the revealed word, the revealed
[1:09:11] word, it will produce the word. That's
[1:09:15] what it's going to do, right? It's not
[1:09:16] going to produce the world. It's not
[1:09:18] going to produce something that's half
[1:09:19] the world. Amen. And and and and half a
[1:09:22] believer, not some hybrid or something.
[1:09:25] But the the revealed word is going to
[1:09:27] produce Yes. the word. Praise God. Amen.
[1:09:31] It's not. Now, listen. It I don't
[1:09:33] believe that the word it's going to
[1:09:34] produce the image of Jesus Christ, which
[1:09:35] is the word we know. But it's not going
[1:09:37] to produce a Pharisee. That's right.
[1:09:41] Oh, those Pharisees, man, they had they
[1:09:42] they thought they had all the the word
[1:09:44] all figured out, you know, how to dress,
[1:09:46] how to live, how to act. But yet, they
[1:09:48] were so hard. They were white and
[1:09:51] supplers, but on the inside, they were
[1:09:53] full of death, right? Full of dead man's
[1:09:55] bones. Amen. And and and and you know,
[1:09:57] you somebody can they cannot miss a
[1:09:59] church service. Oh my. They can look the
[1:10:01] perfect image on the outside, Amen. of
[1:10:04] of what a believer should look like, but
[1:10:06] on the inside, they're full of
[1:10:07] bitterness and full of hardness.
[1:10:10] That is not the image of Christ. Because
[1:10:12] not only is it going to look and
[1:10:14] manifest itself properly, it's going to
[1:10:17] act as it should. Right? I mean, it is
[1:10:19] going to manifest the love of Jesus
[1:10:21] Christ to other people. That's what
[1:10:24] we're supposed to do. It is not my job
[1:10:26] just to judge other people. But we we we
[1:10:30] you know, Jesus said, "You shall know
[1:10:32] the tree by the fruit that it bears."
[1:10:34] That's right. In other words, what it's
[1:10:36] producing is you're going to it's going
[1:10:37] to identify what it is, right? But but
[1:10:41] people don't need me to judge them.
[1:10:43] Amen. They need me to show them what
[1:10:46] truth is. Manifest what truth is. Now,
[1:10:49] if I'm arrogant,
[1:10:52] Yeah. then I'm just as bad off as they
[1:10:54] are. Because I am proud of what I know.
[1:10:58] And I'm going to tell you something. If
[1:10:59] it wasn't for Jesus Christ, I wouldn't
[1:11:01] know anything. That's right. If it
[1:11:03] wasn't for him, I didn't go looking for
[1:11:04] him. I didn't say, you know what, I
[1:11:06] didn't wake up one day and say, you know
[1:11:07] what, I believe that today I'm going to
[1:11:09] instead of just going to the Methodist
[1:11:11] church, I'm going to seek out truth.
[1:11:13] Absolutely not. He come looking for me.
[1:11:16] He come looking for me. Amen. Amen. I
[1:11:19] wouldn't even know where to start at. I
[1:11:20] I was so ignorant. Amen. I still am
[1:11:22] ignorant. Amen. But he found me. He
[1:11:25] changed me. Praise God. And all I can do
[1:11:27] is brag about him. That's all I can say.
[1:11:30] He did it. Amen. As Paul said, if there
[1:11:32] be any good thing in me, it's it's him.
[1:11:34] It's not me. Because in me dwelleth no
[1:11:36] good thing. Amen. It's not what I can
[1:11:38] do. It's what Jesus Christ does in you.
[1:11:41] Amen. And if it's going to make us
[1:11:43] arrogant, if it's going to make us
[1:11:45] proud, if it's going to make us look
[1:11:46] down our nose as somebody else, brother
[1:11:50] said, don't you ever let that arrogant
[1:11:51] spirit come around you. That's what he's
[1:11:53] saying. Amen. So, we got to be careful.
[1:11:55] Amen. That you know what? Hey, I can
[1:11:57] worship God just as much in a nice
[1:11:58] beautiful church. Amen. or I can worship
[1:12:00] God just as much down here in a
[1:12:02] storefront building. Right. Right. Amen.
[1:12:05] Because that's that's God. He's God.
[1:12:07] Whether I'm we're in a nice church or
[1:12:09] where we're down on the street corner or
[1:12:11] where we're in a a storefront building
[1:12:13] or whatever, he's still God. Amen. It
[1:12:16] doesn't change. Hallelujah. Aren't you
[1:12:18] glad? Praise God. So, we realize, Lord,
[1:12:21] it is it is not us, but it is you. And
[1:12:23] it is not me producing the image. Amen.
[1:12:27] All I can do is reyield to him and he
[1:12:30] does. He does it right. He He changes
[1:12:34] us. Praise God. The scripture said over
[1:12:36] there can can a leopard change his
[1:12:39] spots. They they can't do it no more
[1:12:42] than we can. We can't change oursel
[1:12:43] either, right? Amen. But the Lord can
[1:12:46] change it. Amen. And we know that the
[1:12:48] revealed word, he come to produce the
[1:12:50] word in us, not to make us Pharisees.
[1:12:53] That's right. Religious Pharisees.
[1:12:55] Listen.
[1:12:56] 2 Corinthians the 3rd chapter in the
[1:12:59] 18th
[1:13:02] verse. Excuse me. I don't know why it's
[1:13:06] so dry out
[1:13:09] here. It says there in the 2 Corinthians
[1:13:12] 3rd chapter the 18th verse says, "But we
[1:13:14] all with open face beholding as in a
[1:13:18] glass the glory of the Lord."
[1:13:22] Now, you look over there and you
[1:13:23] probably see maybe somewhere in the
[1:13:24] margins of your Bible, maybe it says in
[1:13:25] a mirror, we're looking into a
[1:13:28] mirror. We're looking into a mirror,
[1:13:32] right? Amen. And are
[1:13:35] changed into the same image from glory
[1:13:40] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[1:13:42] Lord. And so we're looking into the
[1:13:45] mirror of the revealed word and seeing
[1:13:48] that's what he's changing us into by his
[1:13:51] spirit. Right? Again, if you know, if I
[1:13:53] thought, well, you know, you know what?
[1:13:55] It's it's my intellect. I've figured
[1:13:57] this out. I've studied this and so
[1:13:59] forth. Well, that would be me. Amen. But
[1:14:01] I can't do that. Amen. That would mean,
[1:14:03] you know, somebody that's got a limited
[1:14:05] IQ like me of 85 or whatever. Amen. I
[1:14:08] said that the other night in our church
[1:14:10] and some brother looked over. I said,
[1:14:11] "Is that good?
[1:14:14] And the whole back row cracked up and
[1:14:16] I'm like, "What are they laughing at?
[1:14:17] I'm trying to preach the gospel here."
[1:14:19] And uh but you know, we if you know,
[1:14:21] Mike, oh yeah, I got something I can
[1:14:23] brag about myself cuz I figure this
[1:14:24] thing out. No, it's the spirit of the
[1:14:27] Lord changing you into the revealed
[1:14:30] word. Amen. It's his spirit doing it. If
[1:14:33] you've got revelation, thank God. Amen.
[1:14:35] That the word is being given to you as
[1:14:37] revelation to change you. Amen. For what
[1:14:40] you once were into the image of Jesus
[1:14:43] Christ in this last hour. Praise God.
[1:14:46] The image of the bride, the image of the
[1:14:47] word. Amen. It is not you. Oh my. The
[1:14:50] message Brother Baron preached to the
[1:14:51] invisible union of the bride of Christ.
[1:14:53] He says a true preacher, the true
[1:14:56] picture of the modern church today.
[1:14:58] Neither does the modern church want any
[1:14:59] of these screaming, shouting, tongue
[1:15:01] speaking. Acts 2:38 youngans around her.
[1:15:04] Yeah. Yeah. See, yeah. She don't want
[1:15:06] any of them whooping and crying and
[1:15:07] screaming. How Amen. Hallelujah. Why
[1:15:09] such a child would immediately put her
[1:15:12] out of her denomination? They had one uh
[1:15:15] they had one like that in one of the
[1:15:17] churches. Why? They would throw her out
[1:15:19] right quick. Why you let such things as
[1:15:21] this go on? He says, "You see, she's
[1:15:25] pregnantated with something because
[1:15:27] she's bringing forth members all the
[1:15:29] time, but she want she don't want none
[1:15:31] of them screaming, hollering, babbling
[1:15:32] too, Acts 2:38 miserable creatures that
[1:15:35] she thinks they are. It would certainly
[1:15:37] embarrass her. It would ruin her
[1:15:40] educated, ethical, scientific society,
[1:15:42] church that she belongs to here. They
[1:15:44] would throw her out at the next council.
[1:15:47] She can't she can't have it. So she
[1:15:49] doesn't want it to be pregnantated with
[1:15:51] the word because that's the only kind
[1:15:55] that the word can bring forth. What is
[1:15:58] the image that the word is going to
[1:16:00] produce? Amen. Amen. The spirit of God
[1:16:03] upon the word anointing the word is
[1:16:05] going to produce the life of Jesus
[1:16:08] Christ. And I'm going to tell you
[1:16:09] something. It may make you act somehow
[1:16:12] different than you've ever act. That's
[1:16:14] okay. Amen. Amen. It's okay. Amen. If
[1:16:17] all of a sudden you get you get caught
[1:16:19] up in the presence of God and you you
[1:16:21] forget about the bobby pins and they
[1:16:23] begin to fly, that's okay. Amen. You let
[1:16:26] God do what God needs to do in your
[1:16:29] life. You don't stop him. Amen. And you
[1:16:31] know what? Because he'll never take you
[1:16:32] out of order. He'll never take you out
[1:16:34] of the word. But whatever he does in you
[1:16:36] is to bring forth the word, right? It's
[1:16:39] not to say, "Well, you know what? Our
[1:16:41] church shouts more than the other
[1:16:42] church." Amen. God's not interested in
[1:16:44] that. Our in gold is not emotion. I know
[1:16:48] around I know around the message hour,
[1:16:50] you know, some people are all about the
[1:16:51] emotion, the emotion, the emotion,
[1:16:53] emotion. I said, you know, I'm okay with
[1:16:54] emotion. I'm fine with emotion, but
[1:16:56] that's not the goal. Emotion is not the
[1:16:59] goal. If the presence of God produces
[1:17:02] emotion, that's okay. That's wonderful.
[1:17:04] I love it. Amen. But it isn't my goal
[1:17:06] just to get you to stand on your feet
[1:17:08] and wave your hanky. Amen. My goal,
[1:17:11] Amen, is to get you closer into Jesus
[1:17:13] Christ. Amen. that he does something in
[1:17:16] your life. Amen. And then if you get
[1:17:18] beside yourself, so be it. Amen. He
[1:17:21] won't let you get out of order. Praise
[1:17:22] God. Amen. It ain't about who can jump
[1:17:25] the highs, who can scream the loudest.
[1:17:27] Amen. That is again, that's not the
[1:17:29] goal. The goal is that the image of
[1:17:31] Jesus Christ be produced in us. That the
[1:17:33] word be produced in us. That the word be
[1:17:36] manifested in us. Amen.
[1:17:39] in in the seven church ages, brother Ram
[1:17:42] says, "A good man out of the good
[1:17:44] treasures of heart bringeth forth good
[1:17:46] things, and an evil man out of the evil
[1:17:47] treasures bringeth forth evil things."
[1:17:49] Now, if a man is born of the word, being
[1:17:52] born again not of corruptible seed, but
[1:17:54] of incorruptible by the word of God,
[1:17:56] which liveth in the body of forever, 1
[1:17:58] Peter 1:23, he will produce the word.
[1:18:02] Amen. He will produce. That is what
[1:18:05] we're supposed to be producing. Yes.
[1:18:07] Whether it makes you shout or not, where
[1:18:09] it makes you fall on your knees and you
[1:18:11] weep. Hey, you know, I'm to the point
[1:18:13] I'd rather fall on my face and a tears
[1:18:15] flow like a river, amen, than to hop
[1:18:17] around the church. But either way, God
[1:18:19] wants it, I don't care. Amen. Amen. As
[1:18:22] long as it produces the word and the
[1:18:24] life of Jesus Christ in me that other
[1:18:27] people can see that. Amen. I want other
[1:18:30] people to be able to see Christ in me.
[1:18:32] Praise God. Because listen, I'm going to
[1:18:34] tell you something again. He's not going
[1:18:36] to the the and and that's what the
[1:18:38] devil's trying to produce. He's trying
[1:18:39] to produce a this hybrid image of
[1:18:42] religion and the world and trying to
[1:18:44] blend up. But you cannot be both.
[1:18:47] Amen. It's not going to be work. Amen.
[1:18:48] Even that's what the world tries. 1
[1:18:50] Corinthians
[1:18:51] 10:20. But I say that the things that
[1:18:54] which the Gentiles sacrifice, they
[1:18:56] sacrifice to devils and not to God. And
[1:18:57] I would not that you should have
[1:18:59] fellowship with devils. You cannot drink
[1:19:01] the cup of the Lord and the cup of
[1:19:02] devils. You cannot partake of the Lord's
[1:19:04] table and of the table of devils. Amen.
[1:19:06] So you can't you you can't do both.
[1:19:08] Amen. Somewhere there's got to be a
[1:19:09] choice that you made like, hey, I've got
[1:19:11] my mind made up. Amen.
[1:19:14] I'm going to quit going to the fountain
[1:19:15] of the world. I'm going to quit turning
[1:19:17] to the things of the world. Amen. That
[1:19:19] are are producing the image of the world
[1:19:22] in me. But I want something that's going
[1:19:24] to produce the image of Jesus Christ in
[1:19:27] my life. Amen. The revealed word. Amen.
[1:19:30] You know, if God cared enough about you,
[1:19:32] listen, I know some of you, this is
[1:19:33] maybe all you've ever known and you was
[1:19:35] raised on a message pew. I wasn't. And
[1:19:38] so, I am thankful for God bringing me
[1:19:40] out. Amen. Bringing me out of those
[1:19:42] things of the world. Amen. I've got an
[1:19:45] appreciation because once I I wasn't a
[1:19:48] surfer, brother Ron. I wasn't that
[1:19:50] coordinated enough to do anything like
[1:19:51] that. I couldn't, you know, I couldn't

[1:19:54] time. But listen, I I But God, Amen. He
[1:20:00] He got a hold of my whole life. Amen. Am

[1:20:15] she used to tell me and he says, "Yeah,
[1:20:17] when you was a kid, you got a spanking
[1:20:18] every
[1:20:20] day." Hey, not much has changed. I still
[1:20:24] get a lot of spankings, but I'm going to
[1:20:25] tell you something. I'm glad I get
[1:20:27] spanked because if you can go out here
[1:20:29] and play with the world and it's okay
[1:20:33] and you're not convicted, then that's a
[1:20:36] bad problem. You may be a bastard, not a
[1:20:38] son, right? So, yeah. Amen. We make
[1:20:40] mistakes. He recogn He knew that. He
[1:20:42] knew before he called you. Amen. No
[1:20:45] baby. Amen. We just had a baby

[1:20:49] seemed like it's a Tennessee girl up
[1:20:50] here or something with a baby. you know,
[1:20:53] and and you know, here's that. That baby
[1:20:55] didn't come out eating steak.
[1:20:58] That baby didn't come out out here, you
[1:21:01] know, walked up here by itself. Said,
[1:21:02] "Hey, dedicate me, Brother Ron. That
[1:21:05] baby I mean, that baby didn't pick out
[1:21:06] his clothes. That baby didn't wipe its
[1:21:08] nose. That baby didn't feed itself."
[1:21:09] Amen. None of us do. Ain't right. Amen.
[1:21:11] But there's a growing pro. But it was
[1:21:13] still born. Not still born. It was It

[1:21:19] was born. You know, there's still
[1:21:21] people. Amen. They're still still born
[1:21:23] Christians, so to speak. Amen. But it
[1:21:25] was born and now it goes through a
[1:21:27] process of growing. It wasn't born matur
[1:21:29] wasn't born perfect. And you know what?
[1:21:31] Neither was you. Neither was I. Amen. It
[1:21:33] is a growing process. Amen. For the Hey,
[1:21:36] I I didn't come out of the Methodist
[1:21:37] church. Amen. Go in and get baptized in
[1:21:39] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Get
[1:21:40] the baptism of Holy Ghost. And the next
[1:21:42] day, I was the perfect picture of the
[1:21:44] revealed word of God. That was not it.
[1:21:46] Amen. But he's still working on me. He's
[1:21:49] still changing me. If you've been around
[1:21:51] me long enough, you saw my you've seen
[1:21:54] saw seen. You've seen amen my
[1:21:56] imperfections. You've seen my flaws.
[1:21:58] You've seen my mistakes. But I'm so glad
[1:22:00] that as a little child sings. Amen. He's
[1:22:03] still working on me to make me what he
[1:22:06] wants to be. What does he want me to be?
[1:22:08] He wants me to be conformed to the
[1:22:10] image. He predestined me to be conformed
[1:22:14] to the image of his dear son. Amen. That
[1:22:17] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:22:19] brethren. And praise God. Thank God.
[1:22:22] Lord, just keep doing the work. You got
[1:22:24] to yield yourself to his presence. Yield
[1:22:27] yourself to his spirit. Let him lead
[1:22:28] you, guide you. You know what? You you
[1:22:30] you let the spirit begin to lead you
[1:22:32] some. He leads you into all truth, which
[1:22:34] is producing the image, right? All truth
[1:22:37] produces the right image. And so, he's
[1:22:39] leading you. And as he leads you, amen,
[1:22:42] all of a sudden there's things maybe in
[1:22:43] your life that maybe you were
[1:22:44] comfortable doing last week, last year.
[1:22:47] Maybe even a person beside you is
[1:22:49] comfortable doing it. But all of a
[1:22:51] sudden, the Lord starts dealing with
[1:22:52] you. That no
[1:22:55] longer can you do that. You step up
[1:22:58] higher. And so that image becomes a
[1:23:01] little bit clearer. You know, if we
[1:23:02] walked out here and we weren't in the
[1:23:04] metropolis of of the Maricopa Valley. We
[1:23:08] were somewhere where we could look up
[1:23:09] and see some stars. You know, I could
[1:23:11] look up there and I could see, wow,
[1:23:12] look. Oh, there's some stars. There's
[1:23:13] some stars. Oh, there's some stars. That
[1:23:15] looks good. But then I pulled out of my
[1:23:17] pocket and said, "Brother Robert, oh
[1:23:19] wait, oh yeah, I can see more now." Oh
[1:23:22] yeah. Oh yeah. Oh. Oh, I see a
[1:23:24] consolation
[1:23:25] now. And you know, somebody says, "Well,
[1:23:28] here's some binoculars. Try these." I
[1:23:30] wow. Look. Oh. Whoa. Look at all Look.
[1:23:34] Wow. That's a planet. Look. And somebody
[1:23:37] says, "Well, forget that. Here's a
[1:23:39] here's a telescope." And you look down.
[1:23:41] Whoa. Oh, you know, I mean, if you all
[1:23:43] of a sudden the image starts getting
[1:23:45] clearer and clearer and clearer and
[1:23:47] clearer, and that's what God is doing.
[1:23:49] Amen. That's what he's doing in us.
[1:23:51] Amen. Oh, man. You might have, you might
[1:23:53] have walked out of the world looking
[1:23:54] like the world. You might have smelled
[1:23:57] like the world. Yeah. You might have
[1:24:00] talked like the world. You walked out of
[1:24:02] him, but all of a sudden, the Holy
[1:24:03] Spirit started revealing word to you and
[1:24:06] taking that word by the washing of the
[1:24:07] water of the word. Who's doing the
[1:24:10] washing? The spirit of God's doing a
[1:24:12] scrubbing on you. Doing a scrubbing on
[1:24:14] all of a sudden ain't bad. And the
[1:24:16] things that just once doing you, oh, I
[1:24:17] can't do that no more. The friends that
[1:24:19] you once was hanging around with, I
[1:24:20] can't hang around them no more. Right.
[1:24:24] Yeah. See again, cuz if you know you can
[1:24:27] hang around with it. Amen. You'll be
[1:24:29] like it.
[1:24:31] Amen. So that's what we God make us
[1:24:33] different. Amen. Let the word Amen. Let
[1:24:36] the spirit begin to take the word begin
[1:24:39] to work in our life. Amen. Producing.
[1:24:41] Amen. That you know, if I come back out
[1:24:43] here sometime and I if it's 6 months or
[1:24:46] it's a year, whenever I come back out
[1:24:47] here, I hope that you can see a
[1:24:50] difference in me that I'm more like
[1:24:52] Jesus Christ.
[1:24:54] Lord, that's the way it ought to be.
[1:24:55] That ought to be a progression in my
[1:24:57] life because I believe that I believe
[1:24:59] we're running out of time. Amen. Amen. I
[1:25:01] believe it's time. It's manifestation
[1:25:02] time. It's time for us to be
[1:25:04] manifestally declared the sons of God,
[1:25:06] right? Amen. that the manifestation of
[1:25:08] what we are begins to uh take place.
[1:25:12] Amen. You know, sometimes it may take a
[1:25:14] a catalyst in your life. You got to have
[1:25:18] something to get you off your seat. You
[1:25:20] got to get something to get you out of
[1:25:21] your your your place of of complacency,
[1:25:25] your seat of complacency. Amen. All of a
[1:25:27] sudden, amen. To draw closer to the
[1:25:29] Lord. You know, Lord might have to may
[1:25:31] be a sickness. It may be some I don't
[1:25:33] know. But the Lord knows how to get our
[1:25:34] attention. Amen. Lord knows how to do
[1:25:36] these things. Amen. And so, you know, we
[1:25:38] you as I said, you can't fellowship with
[1:25:40] the things of the world, be like the
[1:25:42] world and conform to the world and on on
[1:25:44] on on Monday or on Saturday and and and
[1:25:47] try to conform to God on it don't work
[1:25:49] that way. God sees that, right? He
[1:25:52] recognizes that. Brother Ram sent a
[1:25:54] message identification. Our character
[1:25:56] molds us to the image of what we are.
[1:25:59] Our character of the life that is in us.
[1:26:02] Now, you take a little germ of life, it
[1:26:03] if it's a germ of a bird, it'll produce
[1:26:05] a bird. If it's a germ of wheat, it'll
[1:26:06] produce a wheat. If a germ of corn,
[1:26:08] it'll produce corn. See, the life that
[1:26:10] is in it molds the character of it.
[1:26:13] Amen. Christ in you, the hope of glory,
[1:26:16] right? The word on the inside begins to
[1:26:19] manifest on the outside. Praise God.
[1:26:22] Amen. It begins to manifest in what we
[1:26:24] how we talk and how we act and how we
[1:26:26] treat others and and how we love one
[1:26:28] another. And amen. By this shall all men
[1:26:30] know that Jeremiah disciples because you
[1:26:31] have love one to another. Amen. So it be
[1:26:34] well know you're put not a part of my
[1:26:35] click or this click or that click you
[1:26:37] know so you know we're we're not going
[1:26:38] to associate with you. We're not going
[1:26:39] to fellowship with you. That's not the
[1:26:41] spirit of Christ. That's right. That is
[1:26:43] not it. Amen. Amen. He's changing us.
[1:26:47] Amen. Brother Bram said in the doors and
[1:26:49] the door he says therefore when we're
[1:26:52] born of above and all the sin is moved
[1:26:54] plum from across the chasm. It's the
[1:26:56] spirit of God that comes in the creator
[1:26:59] into our heart and he conducts our
[1:27:01] character. We don't lie, steal, cheat,
[1:27:04] honest, upright, walk like citizens of
[1:27:06] heaven. For we for we are that if we're
[1:27:10] born to the spirit of God. Amen. So, you
[1:27:12] know, the spirit of God begins to
[1:27:14] conduct our character. Amen. It's the
[1:27:16] Lord that begins to do these things. But
[1:27:18] you know what? You have to you have to
[1:27:19] yield to him, right? You've got to allow
[1:27:22] him. You've got to give him the liberty
[1:27:24] and the opportunity, Amen, to work
[1:27:27] through you and in you and do what he
[1:27:30] wants to do. the brother Bram said the
[1:27:32] the that the Holy Ghost was a gentleman.
[1:27:34] I mean, he's not going to force himself
[1:27:35] on you, but he also knows how to bring
[1:27:38] you to where he needs you to be. Thank
[1:27:40] you, Lord. Amen. Amen. Lord, do it if
[1:27:43] you got to do it. Whatever you got to
[1:27:45] do. I might be stubborn. I might be
[1:27:47] hard-headed, but Lord, whatever you got
[1:27:48] to do to bring me around, Lord, you do,
[1:27:51] you bring me around. First, I'm going to
[1:27:53] John the 3rd chapter the 21st verse. He
[1:27:57] said, "But he that doeth truth cometh to
[1:28:00] the light that his deeds may be made
[1:28:03] manifest that they are wrought in God."
[1:28:07] That that what we're doing, the deeds
[1:28:09] that we're manifesting are wrought in
[1:28:10] God. Now, there's people that love
[1:28:11] darkness better than light because their
[1:28:12] deeds are evil, right? I mean, they
[1:28:14] don't want it to be exposed. They don't
[1:28:15] want it to be in a light. Amen. But, you
[1:28:17] know, they that that doeth the truth or
[1:28:20] that that doeth truth, Amen. that has
[1:28:22] the word cometh to the light. Praise
[1:28:25] God. Because their deeds are are not
[1:28:27] their own. Their deeds are wrought of
[1:28:30] God. Amen. It's God that is doing the
[1:28:32] work. So if God is doing the work in me,
[1:28:34] how can I take credit for it?
[1:28:37] Because if I want to take credit for
[1:28:38] what God is doing in my life, then I
[1:28:40] say, "Well, you know what? He don't
[1:28:41] deserve the glory. I deserve the glory."
[1:28:43] And I want to tell you something. That
[1:28:44] would be a bad thing to do. Amen. God
[1:28:46] stops right there. Amen. In the message
[1:28:49] infallible proof of resurrection,
[1:28:51] brother Bram says and the spirit of God
[1:28:52] in you manifest the life of Jesus.
[1:28:56] The spirit of God in you manifests the
[1:29:00] life of Jesus. So that's the image that
[1:29:04] is going to be produced by the spirit of
[1:29:06] God is going to be the word, right?
[1:29:08] Amen. It's going to produce that just
[1:29:10] like the main spring in a watch that
[1:29:12] ticks and every part of it moves just
[1:29:15] exactly the right. It controls your
[1:29:17] emotions. It controls your habits. It
[1:29:19] controls your senses. It controls your
[1:29:22] faith. It is the main spring, the Holy
[1:29:24] Spirit in the middle of your heart
[1:29:25] controlling you. Amen. So, you know what
[1:29:26] it's doing is it's controlling things
[1:29:28] when we allow him to. And it produces
[1:29:30] Jesus Christ. It produces it manifests
[1:29:32] the life. It manifests the word. Praise
[1:29:35] God. Amen. I got to get down here close
[1:29:38] real quickly. Amen. I was going longer
[1:29:40] than I thought I would. Amen. So,
[1:29:43] Brother Bam sent a message.
[1:29:47] What does what does take to make a
[1:29:49] Christian? What does it take to make a
[1:29:51] Christian life? He said the Holy Spirit
[1:29:53] will make every movement like Christ.
[1:29:56] It'll make you Christlike. The fruits of
[1:29:57] the spirit. Love, joy, peace,
[1:29:58] longsuffering, goodness, meekness,
[1:29:59] gentleness, patience, faith. Those
[1:30:01] things are what the Holy Spirit controls
[1:30:03] our emotions. Holy Spirit brings you
[1:30:05] into the operation are in control of
[1:30:07] God. That you walk in peace and in love
[1:30:09] and in joy and longsuffering and
[1:30:10] goodness, meekness, gentleness,
[1:30:11] patience. It isn't something that you
[1:30:13] do. It's something the Holy Spirit does
[1:30:15] in you. It's no longer an intellectual
[1:30:17] thought of your own. It's a subconscious
[1:30:20] moving of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Moving
[1:30:23] the word. Amen. Producing the word. Have
[1:30:27] you ever thought, hey, let's go out here
[1:30:28] to the to the the field where the sheep
[1:30:30] are and you know, let's say, hey, hey,
[1:30:33] sheep, you
[1:30:34] know, what are you doing to produce that
[1:30:37] wool? Well, let me think here. I'm going
[1:30:39] to, you know, if I really were think
[1:30:40] about it hard today, I'll grow I'll grow
[1:30:42] a millimeter of wool today. If I really,
[1:30:44] if I really take thought about if I
[1:30:46] root, no. Because of the nature, because
[1:30:48] of what it is, it produces wool. Amen.
[1:30:51] Amen. The believer, Amen. filled with
[1:30:54] the spirit of God. Amen. They're going
[1:30:56] to produce the word of almighty God. It
[1:30:59] becomes a subconscious act of you. It's
[1:31:01] no longer you have to think about it,
[1:31:03] right? Amen. You know, if you've ever
[1:31:05] ever taken on some kind of new hobby or
[1:31:07] whatever it is, and and maybe you needed
[1:31:10] is something that required some
[1:31:11] coordination and and I I don't know. Let
[1:31:13] me let me let me guess. Uh uh what is
[1:31:16] that stuff that y'all play? I hear
[1:31:18] pickle ball or whatever. You know, you
[1:31:20] you get that little paddle and you know,
[1:31:21] you have to think about what I got to
[1:31:23] stay out of the kitchen. I thought,
[1:31:24] what's the kitchen? Where's the kitchen?
[1:31:25] Yeah. You know, what is that? You know,
[1:31:27] you know, you're over here. No, it's not
[1:31:29] your turn ball. You know, you got to be
[1:31:30] over here. You got to serve over there.
[1:31:31] Whatever. And you know, you're thinking
[1:31:32] about, oh man, we got I got to do this
[1:31:34] and I got to do that. And you're just
[1:31:35] sitting there going like, well, I don't
[1:31:36] know what to do. Where to go next? You
[1:31:37] know, get out of the kitchen. I'm in a
[1:31:38] kitchen. Don't be in a kitchen. You
[1:31:40] can't hit the ball in the kitchen. And
[1:31:41] I'm like, what? And you just, you know,
[1:31:43] you're just c I got to do. I I got But
[1:31:47] you know, after you've done it a few
[1:31:48] times, man, you're at home in the
[1:31:51] kitchen, whatever the kitchen is. You
[1:31:54] know, you you know, you know what to do.
[1:31:55] You don't have to ask somebody, "What am
[1:31:56] I supposed to do? Where am I supposed to
[1:31:57] go?" It becomes a part of it, right? I
[1:32:01] mean, you you know what you're doing,
[1:32:02] but you I I think they they call that
[1:32:04] what muscle memory or whatever. You
[1:32:07] know, you all of a sudden, you know, I I
[1:32:09] years
[1:32:10] ago at the office, I went out to play
[1:32:13] golf with the mayor and all I was all I
[1:32:15] was on a golf course was
[1:32:19] entertainment and a liability.
[1:32:21] Entertainment and liability cuz you
[1:32:22] didn't know who I was going to hit or
[1:32:23] what I was going to hit or whatever, you
[1:32:25] know. And you know, I get up there and
[1:32:27] I'm like, "Okay, you know, okay, keep
[1:32:29] your head down." Okay. Hey, you know,
[1:32:31] keep your arm straight, do this, do
[1:32:32] that. You know, I'm thinking about it
[1:32:33] and I missed the ball because all I was
[1:32:36] thinking about it because, you know, you
[1:32:38] you hadn't developed the muscle memory,
[1:32:40] right? I give it up a long long time ago
[1:32:43] because all it does was frustrate me.
[1:32:46] And I didn't need to be a frustrated
[1:32:47] Christian. And so I just give it up. I,
[1:32:50] you know, I forget this, forget that.
[1:32:52] And uh and you know, I guess, but you
[1:32:54] know, you get to the point there's a
[1:32:56] muscle memory there that you don't have
[1:32:58] to think about. And as a believer,
[1:33:01] right? A minute, it gets to the point as
[1:33:02] brother Bam said here, you get to the
[1:33:04] place all of a sudden it's a spirit of
[1:33:06] God operating in you. You know how to
[1:33:09] yield yourself to the spirit. You know
[1:33:11] how to let him take control. Right?
[1:33:14] Listen, I I I didn't I didn't go study
[1:33:17] figure out how to be a preacher. I
[1:33:19] didn't go, you know, let me read a book
[1:33:20] about how to be a preacher. Let me, you
[1:33:22] know, take a course on how to be a
[1:33:23] preacher. You know, it was it was simply
[1:33:26] yielding to the spirit, to the
[1:33:29] anointing, and letting him do the work.
[1:33:32] Amen. And he can do the work when we
[1:33:34] yield to him, right? Amen. So, he wants
[1:33:36] to work in you. He wants to manifest his
[1:33:39] presence, his attributes, his character
[1:33:43] in your life. Amen. But you got to yield
[1:33:45] to him. Amen. The Holy Ghost will make
[1:33:48] every movement like Christ. It'll make
[1:33:52] you Christlike. Praise God. So
[1:33:55] listen, what we manifest
[1:33:59] declares who is our father. That's
[1:34:02] right.
[1:34:03] 1 John the 3rd chapter the 10th verse.
[1:34:05] In fact, let me look here. A few
[1:34:07] musicians will come on
[1:34:08] back. 1 John 3r chapter the 10th verse
[1:34:11] says, "In this the children of God are
[1:34:13] manifest, and the children of the devil.
[1:34:15] Whosoever doth not righteousness is not
[1:34:17] of God, neither he that loveth not his
[1:34:21] brother." So he's saying here, you know
[1:34:23] what? They they can say they're a
[1:34:24] Christian all they want to. They say
[1:34:26] they're a believer all they want to. But
[1:34:28] if they don't do righteousness, God is
[1:34:30] not their father. They are not producing
[1:34:32] his image. They're not bearing his
[1:34:33] image. They're not identified with him.
[1:34:35] So you know it's it is the to be like is
[1:34:38] there is resembling. Amen. You're they
[1:34:40] they're not like him. But it says here
[1:34:43] first John the third chapter the second
[1:34:44] verse just down at the second verse. It
[1:34:46] says, "Beloved, how are the sons of God
[1:34:50] now? Are we the sons of God? And it does
[1:34:52] not yet appear what we shall
[1:34:54] be. Now, here's John writing. It does
[1:34:57] not yet appear what we shall be because
[1:35:01] the fullness of the word had not been
[1:35:02] manifested. So, we don't know. He said
[1:35:05] here, right? We don't know what what
[1:35:07] we're going to look like all the way
[1:35:08] down here to, you know, we haven't got
[1:35:10] the full the fullness of revelation. It
[1:35:12] does not yet appear what we shall be.
[1:35:14] But we know that when he shall appear,
[1:35:17] we shall be like him, for we shall see
[1:35:19] him as he is. He's going to be revealed
[1:35:22] according to Luke 10 uh excuse me, Luke
[1:35:25] 17:30. Amen. When the son, even when the
[1:35:28] shall be in the days when the son of man
[1:35:30] is revealed in our day, our time, he's
[1:35:34] revealing himself. And now it is
[1:35:37] appearing what we're going to be. We're
[1:35:38] going to be like him because he's going
[1:35:40] to take word by his spirit and produce
[1:35:44] his image. Hallelujah. Thank God. I say,
[1:35:48] Lord, I could never do it.
[1:35:52] No matter how hard I tried, no matter
[1:35:55] how determined I am, I could never ever
[1:35:59] do it. If you don't do it in me, it'll
[1:36:02] never happen. But he knew that I
[1:36:06] couldn't do it. He knew that you
[1:36:07] couldn't do it. He said, "I'm going to
[1:36:09] give you revealed word. I'm going to
[1:36:10] give you revelation." Amen. And then I'm
[1:36:13] going to take my spirit on that revealed
[1:36:16] word
[1:36:18] sir. And it's going to produce the image
[1:36:20] of Jesus Christ in the last day when the
[1:36:22] world is
[1:36:24] going insane. And when the world is
[1:36:26] looking more filthy and more ungodly and
[1:36:29] doing more
[1:36:31] corruption in this wicked evil evil age
[1:36:36] like that little lily down there in the
[1:36:38] mire of that that pond down in the mud
[1:36:42] and the mire. How could anything good
[1:36:44] come out of that wicked mire? Filth of
[1:36:47] mud of that pond and all of a sudden
[1:36:50] that that that that little lily becomes
[1:36:53] starts rising through the mud. Amen. It
[1:36:56] begins to start rising through that
[1:36:57] stagnated water. Amen. Up to the top and
[1:37:00] that beautiful bloom comes forth. It was
[1:37:03] something that was inside of that lily.
[1:37:05] Amen. Amen. They didn't have to think
[1:37:07] about it. It was something that was
[1:37:08] being produced in it. Praise God. And
[1:37:10] that's what God is going to do in us in
[1:37:13] this age. I said, "Oh God, let it be.
[1:37:17] Let it be, Lord. God, pull me through
[1:37:19] the mire of Vladia. Amen. pull me
[1:37:21] through the mire and the filth of this
[1:37:23] age that we're living in.
[1:37:27] See, I used to have the thought, well,
[1:37:29] you know what, Lord, if I could if I
[1:37:32] could move somewhere to maybe the Rocky
[1:37:35] Mountains up in Canada or somewhere and
[1:37:38] just get a cabin and live in a cabin,
[1:37:41] man, I could live this
[1:37:43] thing. You ever thought like that? Am I
[1:37:47] the only person that's ever thought like
[1:37:49] that? Yeah. Yeah, if I could just get
[1:37:50] away from everybody,
[1:37:52] not be exposed to all these things. So,
[1:37:55] oh, I could live this thing. But you
[1:37:57] know what? He's revealed that in the
[1:38:00] filth, he's going to produce a bride.
[1:38:04] He's going to produce his image. It
[1:38:06] ain't going to be locked away in a cabin
[1:38:08] somewhere,
[1:38:10] but it's going to be right here in the
[1:38:11] filth of Latia. There's a bride, AJ.
[1:38:14] Amen. There's a bride that's coming
[1:38:16] forth bearing not just the image but the
[1:38:20] very character of Christ the word not
[1:38:23] hard not critical not judgmental
[1:38:28] but the love of Jesus Christ when
[1:38:30] everybody else is hating one another and
[1:38:33] when everybody else is screaming out
[1:38:35] they're getting on their social
[1:38:36] platforms and screaming out and and
[1:38:39] spewing bitterness and hatred toward
[1:38:41] everybody else in the midst of all that
[1:38:44] God is going to produce the image of
[1:38:47] Jesus Christ. I say, Lord,
[1:38:50] let that be in me, Lord. God, do that
[1:38:54] work. Can we just stand to our feet
[1:38:56] tonight? Lord, do the work. Do the work
[1:38:58] in me. Amen. Amen. One last quote here
[1:39:02] from the seven church ages. Brother Beam
[1:39:05] said, "They and the bride will be so
[1:39:08] much like him that they will even be in
[1:39:11] his very image." This is in order to be
[1:39:15] united with him. They will be one. They
[1:39:17] will be the very manifestation of the
[1:39:20] word of the living God. They will be the
[1:39:24] very
[1:39:25] manifestation of the word of the living
[1:39:27] God. Denominations cannot produce this
[1:39:31] the wrong seed. Amen. Amen. Whose image
[1:39:34] are we bearing? Amen. Yield to Jesus
[1:39:37] Christ. Heavenly Father, we just come
[1:39:39] right now bowing our hearts before you,
[1:39:41] Lord. I know some here maybe have had a
[1:39:43] difficult week. Maybe they've had a
[1:39:45] difficult uh uh uh uh Wednesday, Lord.
[1:39:48] Maybe their life is full and they don't
[1:39:50] have time to stop and and and to just
[1:39:53] enter into your presence, Lord. But God,
[1:39:55] some of them have come out tonight,
[1:39:57] Lord, and they're here, Lord. Whenever
[1:39:58] they they could have probably been doing
[1:40:00] a lot of other things, Lord, at home,
[1:40:03] but Lord, because they come out here
[1:40:05] tonight, Lord, would you just let your
[1:40:07] spirit just sweep over? Yes, Lord.
[1:40:12] and the word that is on the inside, that
[1:40:16] revealed word, Lord, let the spirit of
[1:40:17] God just begin to woo over it, dear Lord
[1:40:20] Jesus. Let it just begin to warm up that
[1:40:24] word, oh God, in their heart that it
[1:40:28] begin to produce you, Lord. Not all the
[1:40:32] anxiety of everything that's going on
[1:40:33] around
[1:40:34] us, Lord. when the world is going
[1:40:38] insane, Lord, let us just draw near to
[1:40:41] you. And God, you produce that. Lord,
[1:40:43] your spirit just begin to produce. Lord,
[1:40:46] I don't care if in my life it's a shout,
[1:40:48] if it's a tear, Lord, as long as it's
[1:40:50] the word. As long as it produces the
[1:40:53] word, Lord, I don't care. Long as it
[1:40:55] produces your character, Lord, I don't
[1:40:57] care. Dear God, do that, Lord. Because
[1:40:59] so many times I find myself a failure, a
[1:41:03] failure as a father, as a a husband, as
[1:41:06] a pastor. Lord, as a Christian, as a
[1:41:09] believer, Lord, do the work that I
[1:41:12] cannot do. Do the work in these
[1:41:15] believers that Lord, none of us can do
[1:41:18] ourselves. Lord, if if we could do it,
[1:41:20] then Lord, you wouldn't have had to
[1:41:23] come. But we couldn't. You had to come
[1:41:25] to show us the word to be the word to
[1:41:29] become we might become the word Lord and
[1:41:32] that it be operated by your
[1:41:34] spirit. Grant it Lord in this assembly
[1:41:37] Lord the hearts maybe that are hurting
[1:41:39] the hearts that don't know which way to
[1:41:41] turn. Maybe they got those that have
[1:41:43] decisions to make dear Lord that they
[1:41:45] don't know the answers to. Lord we know
[1:41:48] that you have the answer that they can
[1:41:50] turn to you. they can yield to you, dear
[1:41:52] Lord Jesus, and that God, you can guide,
[1:41:55] you can lead. Lord, grant it, Lord. We
[1:41:57] thank you. We praise you, Lord. Maybe
[1:41:59] there's somebody here that is suffering.
[1:42:01] Maybe there's somebody that's got a a a
[1:42:03] diagnosis from the doctor that was less
[1:42:05] than desirable. Lord, we're just praying
[1:42:07] that God, you would come and minister to
[1:42:09] them and bring your healing virtue them
[1:42:11] because, Lord, healing is still in your
[1:42:13] word. It's still a part of who you are
[1:42:15] and it's part of what we manifest, Lord
[1:42:17] Jesus. That we can lay hands on the
[1:42:19] sick, dear Lord. That we can do these
[1:42:21] things as believers that these signs
[1:42:23] shall follow us, Lord. That we can do
[1:42:25] the works that you did and greater works
[1:42:27] because you go into your father. Lord,
[1:42:29] we believe it. We thank you. We praise
[1:42:31] you, Lord. Let us begin to manifest
[1:42:33] these things in this hour. Lord, I
[1:42:36] praise you. I appreciate you. I need
[1:42:38] you. In Jesus precious, holy name we
[1:42:42] pray. We ask. God bless you church.
[1:42:44] Amen.
[1:42:48] Amen. In my life Lord be
[1:42:51] glorified
[1:42:53] in
[1:42:55] my
[1:42:56] life.

[1:49:08] [Music]
[1:49:13] That was refreshing tonight.
[1:49:18] It's all about him. Yes, it is.
[1:49:20] Producing an image in you
[1:49:25] manifesting an image that others might
[1:49:28] see Christ.
[1:49:31] Help us, Lord, that we bear that image
[1:49:34] that others would say there's something
[1:49:36] different about you. That's right. Yes.
[1:49:39] If we don't stand out from the crowd
[1:49:42] or something different,
[1:49:45] there's something wrong somewhere.
[1:49:48] [Music]
[1:49:49] Because
[1:49:51] Israel never fit in. That's right. When
[1:49:54] they tried to fit in, they were choosing
[1:49:58] captains to go and be like the
[1:50:01] Philistines and be like the and
[1:50:03] the Sodommites and the different ones
[1:50:06] that lived around them. That was their
[1:50:08] problem. They began to integrate all
[1:50:11] this stuff of the world into their
[1:50:14] worship and it defiled them. God help
[1:50:18] us. Amen.
[1:50:21] Amen. God bless you all this evening.
[1:50:23] What a pleasure it's been to be at
[1:50:26] church once again, hear his word,
[1:50:29] ministering to our hearts, telling us
[1:50:32] where we come from, where we're going,
[1:50:35] and what God is doing in your life. He's
[1:50:38] manifesting himself.
[1:50:41] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. God bless
[1:50:45] you. Let's just bow our heads in a word
[1:50:47] of prayer. Heavenly Father, I thank you,
[1:50:50] Lord. Yes. that you place this
[1:50:54] thought of manifesting the image of God
[1:50:58] in our brother Lindsay's heart. Father,
[1:51:01] the scriptures, the quotes, every one of
[1:51:04] them fitting so perfectly together.
[1:51:07] Father, realizing that that's what it's
[1:51:10] all about. It's you, Lord, wanting to
[1:51:12] manifest your life in our lives. I pray
[1:51:17] heavenly father as we are drawing to the
[1:51:20] close of all of
[1:51:24] humanity. The time is so very quickly
[1:51:27] going by and we know that the world is
[1:51:30] coming into the image of their
[1:51:33] father. More and more reprobate minds.
[1:51:36] Why? All this confusion. They don't know
[1:51:39] a man from a woman. Father God, they've
[1:51:43] been turned over to uh a repbate mind
[1:51:47] that they might believe a lie and be
[1:51:50] damned. Oh God, I pray if that be so
[1:51:54] about them, then what about us? A pure
[1:51:58] mind, a holy mind, a Christlike mind.
[1:52:02] Let this mind that was in Christ be in
[1:52:04] you.
[1:52:06] Oh Father, I pray you will just draw us
[1:52:09] closer
[1:52:11] to that image, oh
[1:52:14] father, that we will manifest the word
[1:52:18] of God for this
[1:52:19] hour. We thank you, we praise you, we
[1:52:23] ask these things for your
[1:52:26] glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:52:30] Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. All
[1:52:33] right, let's sing one more song here.
[1:52:36] You got another song, brother? I'm in
[1:52:37] love with Jesus.
[1:52:41] [Music]
[1:52:43] Falling in
[1:52:45] love with
[1:52:50] Jesus. Falling in love with
[1:52:57] Jesus. Oh, falling in love with
[1:53:03] Jesus was the best thing I've ever been.
[1:53:07] Let's sing it
[1:53:12] again. Falling in love with
[1:53:19] Jesus. Falling in love with Jesus.
[1:53:25] [Music]
[1:53:27] Oh, falling in love with
[1:53:32] Jesus was the best thing I've
[1:53:35] ever in his arms. I feel
[1:53:40] protected. In his
[1:53:43] arms, I
[1:53:45] feel
[1:53:48] protected. In his
[1:53:50] arms, never disconnected.
[1:53:56] In his arms I
[1:53:59] feel
[1:54:00] protected. There's no place I'd
[1:54:04] rather falling in
[1:54:08] love. Falling in love with
[1:54:15] Jesus. Falling in love with Jesus.
[1:54:21] [Music]
[1:54:24] Falling in love with
[1:54:26] [Music]
[1:54:28] Jesus was the best thing I've
[1:54:33] ever Amen. Go in that name
[1:54:42] [Music]
[1:54:49] tonight. Hey. Hey. Hey.
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:55:46] Oh yeah.
[1:55:52] [Music]
