[54:44] you
[54:45] knock the door will be open huh thank
[54:48] you Lord amen praise the Lord St John
[54:52] 16 and then we'll go to Hebrews 6 and
[54:55] and then to
[54:56] Luke 17 so St John chapter
[55:02] 16 12-
[55:06] 16 Jesus speaking to his
[55:12] disciples he has so many sermons he'd
[55:15] like to preach to them he's got so much
[55:18] that he would like to say to them he's
[55:21] got so much he would like to give to
[55:23] them but watch what he says I have yet
[55:27] many things to say unto
[55:29] you but you cannot bear them
[55:33] now he
[55:36] recognizes there's coming a time they
[55:38] will catch it amen he's not making fun
[55:41] of
[55:42] them he's just saying oh I got so much
[55:47] in fact I got so much on my heart it's
[55:49] going to take me an eternity to reveal
[55:51] myself amen but he starts out you cannot
[55:54] bear them now but watch this how be it
[55:58] when he the spirit of Truth is
[56:03] come he will guide you into all
[56:07] Truth for he shall not speak of
[56:10] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[56:13] that shall he speak and he will show you
[56:17] things to come amen he shall glorify me
[56:21] for he shall receive of mine and shall
[56:24] show it unto
[56:26] you notice he's going to show you things
[56:29] all
[56:30] things that the father hath are mine
[56:33] therefore said I that he shall take of
[56:38] mine and shall show it unto you and just
[56:41] a few sentences every time I'm going to
[56:43] show you I'm going to show you if you
[56:45] ask God to show you he will that's part
[56:48] of his will his word is his
[56:53] will
[56:55] a little while and ye shall not see me
[56:58] and again a little while and you shall
[57:00] see me because I go to the
[57:03] father Hebrews chapter 6 if you would
[57:06] turn with me now now how many know that
[57:10] the Apostle Paul was one born out of du
[57:15] season he was one that the disciples
[57:17] even said it's hard to be
[57:20] understood now here is one of these
[57:23] quandaries when when he's talking to the
[57:25] Hebrews we're talking Jewish people
[57:27] we're talking Hebrews people raised up
[57:30] they know the law they know the law of
[57:31] Moses they know these
[57:34] things so watch what he says therefore
[57:37] leaving the principle of the doctrine of
[57:40] Christ wow now I imagine there was
[57:42] breakes locking up everywhere when he
[57:44] said that
[57:47] whoa why in the world do we leave our
[57:52] foundation why do we leave this doctrine
[57:55] of Christ cuz Christ is the
[57:58] anointing and it's the anointed word of
[58:01] all the ages whoa
[58:04] Paul oh hang on there are times that
[58:09] when a pastor a preacher a prophet says
[58:12] something and all of a sudden you don't
[58:14] understand your breaks of human
[58:17] carnality lock up and you go whoa amen
[58:20] and you may not understand just keep
[58:22] reading amen just hang on
[58:25] it's a Tim relased
[58:28] Revelation let us go unto
[58:33] Perfection not laying again the
[58:36] foundation of repentance from dead works
[58:39] and of Faith towards
[58:42] god of the doctrine of
[58:46] baptisms and of the laying on of
[58:49] hands and of resurrection of the dead
[58:52] and of Eternal
[58:53] judgment
[58:55] do you see this and this we will do if
[59:00] God permit
[59:02] amen and even as Brother David said here
[59:05] out loud
[59:09] therefore that's why if you go back and
[59:11] you see after the order of MDC yeah
[59:14] there and you see what Paul was talking
[59:17] about
[59:18] therefore let us
[59:21] go unto Perfection how many of you are
[59:24] interested
[59:25] imperfection you better be because Jesus
[59:29] said as your father in Heaven
[59:34] is now if God tells you you got to have
[59:37] Perfection you need it but understand
[59:41] God has to provide a
[59:43] way lest he makes you
[59:46] frustrated amen huh and God don't want
[59:49] frustrated Christians right they don't
[59:51] want you getting up okay I'm going to be
[59:52] perfect today I'm going to go and and
[59:55] next thing you know you stub your toe on
[59:57] your way to go brush your teeth and why
[1:00:00] me why all these all a sudden your day
[1:00:03] is
[1:00:05] ruined on so it's not in the Perfection
[1:00:09] of this carnal man but the Perfection
[1:00:13] that comes through
[1:00:15] Christ amen amen so um let us go to Luke
[1:00:20] 17 now if you would
[1:00:23] please

[1:01:49] here lot let's look at this but the same
[1:01:53] day that lot went out of Sodom it rained
[1:01:56] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[1:01:58] destroyed them all wow I thought God's a
[1:02:03] god of
[1:02:06] love he is a god of love but he's also a
[1:02:09] god of judgment and don't forget it
[1:02:10] because our
[1:02:13] god it says serve him with reverence and
[1:02:16] godly fear for our God is a consuming
[1:02:20] fire don't you play with God Amen don't
[1:02:24] you dare play with God let me tell you
[1:02:26] don't you be dead caught dead without
[1:02:30] Christ
[1:02:33] amen
[1:02:36] amen verse 30 very familiar portion of
[1:02:41] scripture even thus shall it be in the
[1:02:43] day when the son of man is revealed may
[1:02:47] God bless the reading of his word you
[1:02:49] all may be seated this morning in the
[1:02:51] presence of
[1:02:52] God I want to continue on with this
[1:02:54] thought this
[1:02:57] morning the revealing of the son of man
[1:03:00] this is part five I want to take a t a a
[1:03:05] subject of who touched
[1:03:12] me
[1:03:16] now for just a
[1:03:19] moment let me just kind of share some
[1:03:23] things with with you to lay a little bit
[1:03:26] of a foundation for this
[1:03:28] direction and we know that brother
[1:03:30] Brenham
[1:03:32] said that the Jews it was a Jewish
[1:03:36] custom for hands to be laid
[1:03:39] on is just the Jewish way he said but
[1:03:44] with the
[1:03:45] Gentiles It Was Always by
[1:03:49] faith we're going to look at this
[1:03:52] according to the scripture you're going
[1:03:53] to see it it's it's so
[1:03:56] plain and once you see it it really it
[1:03:59] changes the whole thing now the wife and
[1:04:01] I set up last night and we listened to
[1:04:05] the tape speak to this
[1:04:08] mountain brother Brenham says you know
[1:04:11] this is one of those scriptures that
[1:04:13] I've never preached on because I never
[1:04:14] understood
[1:04:16] it he said if you say into this mountain
[1:04:19] be thou removed how many of you know
[1:04:22] that well which one of you have ever
[1:04:26] moved a mountain I want to ask you who
[1:04:29] in the scriptures ever removed mountains
[1:04:32] whoever said be thou removed and it was
[1:04:34] moved the closest one we have it is John
[1:04:37] the Baptist and it said he'll fill up
[1:04:39] the valleys and he'll tear down the
[1:04:41] mountains and the high places will be
[1:04:42] made
[1:04:43] low other than that what it is it's a
[1:04:46] figurative of
[1:04:48] speech it's hey you got something in
[1:04:51] your life that seems like a mountain
[1:04:53] right and I tell you what all of us can
[1:04:55] Cruise along when it's
[1:04:57] flat and if we're not careful we're
[1:05:00] lowlander
[1:05:02] Believers huh the moment we start to get
[1:05:05] an
[1:05:09] incline much
[1:05:12] further huh yeah you're out of breath
[1:05:16] you're not used to it okay but if
[1:05:18] somebody else who is used to climbing
[1:05:21] once in a while huh who can get up there
[1:05:24] into the High Altitude sir hey I have a
[1:05:27] I have a a cabin up there in presc at
[1:05:30] 7400t elevation and it takes me about a
[1:05:34] day to kind of get acclimated
[1:05:39] be you don't get that deep breath full
[1:05:42] of oxygen but if we're not careful we're
[1:05:44] we're lowland Believers and we never get
[1:05:47] to the altitude and we never go up hill
[1:05:51] and going up
[1:05:52] hill have any of you you hiked a hill
[1:05:55] before yeah yeah you you know I remember
[1:05:58] one of the first times we were going to
[1:06:00] climb uh to a peak near my hometown in
[1:06:04] California and we were we we actually I
[1:06:08] better not tell all of the story We
[1:06:11] ditched school one
[1:06:12] day to take and we took a flag
[1:06:16] pool and a
[1:06:19] flag and we wanted to plant it on top of
[1:06:23] a week that the next day when all the
[1:06:27] kids went to school we'd say hey you
[1:06:29] guys see that flag up there that was us
[1:06:33] we did it yesterday but it's amazing one
[1:06:35] of my friends had a house that was way
[1:06:38] up in the Sierra Madre Mountains right
[1:06:41] there near our hometown and so we left
[1:06:44] from his house like 4 in the morning
[1:06:46] we're ready hey all of us we were in
[1:06:49] football so we're in pretty good shape
[1:06:52] from running wind Sprints and everything
[1:06:54] well anyway we we start going and let me
[1:06:57] tell you you you you you start climbing
[1:07:00] and you go up and you you think I think
[1:07:02] that's the peak yeah that's not not much
[1:07:06] furthery hey you guys
[1:07:08] stop no it's not much further and you
[1:07:10] get up there and guess what it was the
[1:07:12] peak before the peak we didn't see all
[1:07:15] the valleys we didn't see all the little
[1:07:17] ups and downs we didn't see the little
[1:07:19] detours that we had to go around and
[1:07:21] guess what the moment that we went up to
[1:07:23] the next Peak we found out that there
[1:07:25] was still another Peak between the peak
[1:07:27] we wanted to get
[1:07:29] to how many of you have understand that
[1:07:32] many times you see where you want to go
[1:07:34] but you don't see the little valleys and
[1:07:36] the little things that you're going to
[1:07:38] go
[1:07:39] through amen but keep going Hall we're
[1:07:43] not quitters we don't turn around just
[1:07:46] because things get
[1:07:48] rough
[1:07:51] amen so I want to take
[1:07:55] and to show you from the scriptures that
[1:07:58] the
[1:07:59] Gentiles okay it is they are being moved
[1:08:03] on by
[1:08:06] faith and faith is the substance of
[1:08:09] things hoped for and the evidence of
[1:08:10] things not seen by faith one of my
[1:08:13] favorite chapters is there in
[1:08:16] Hebrews by faith Noah by faith Abraham
[1:08:19] by faith every one of them by faith well
[1:08:23] if took faith for them to claim the goal
[1:08:27] in their day then what about you and
[1:08:30] I and Faith cometh by hear hearing the
[1:08:34] word of God that's right so if you want
[1:08:37] more faith increase your
[1:08:40] hearing but it's only to those who have
[1:08:43] an
[1:08:44] ear because many will
[1:08:47] say that did not he it say that Elias
[1:08:52] well said that many have ears to hear
[1:08:55] but they hear not many have eyes to see
[1:08:59] but they see not so we're not talking
[1:09:01] about a natural ear and a natural
[1:09:04] eyesight we're talking about that elect
[1:09:07] seed having an
[1:09:09] ability and it's given to you before let
[1:09:14] me let me say before the foundation of
[1:09:16] the world it wasn't something you did it
[1:09:19] wasn't something that you attained to
[1:09:22] you were born with with the grace of God
[1:09:25] that there would come a time in your
[1:09:28] life that God would open your eyes and
[1:09:31] you would
[1:09:32] see the revealing of the son of
[1:09:38] man now you might be raised around this
[1:09:41] message you might go to church you might
[1:09:44] learn the Sunday School teachings the
[1:09:48] songs you come to church you're you're
[1:09:51] uh you're brought along with your
[1:09:53] parents but if this ain't for you
[1:09:56] there's coming a time when you will go
[1:09:58] do your thing that's
[1:10:03] right so yeah time tested Memorials of
[1:10:07] God you're going to be
[1:10:09] tested are you here because Mom and Dad
[1:10:12] are you not old enough now you're just
[1:10:14] waiting till you turn
[1:10:16] 18 and you can be your own man your own
[1:10:19] woman you can do your own thing well
[1:10:23] there'll come a time and when you do
[1:10:24] you're going to find out there ain't
[1:10:27] nothing out
[1:10:29] there but if you think that's
[1:10:33] life it's like it's like this guy had
[1:10:36] all kinds of money and instead he didn't
[1:10:38] want to be buried in a coffin he wanted
[1:10:40] to be buried in His Cadillac this is
[1:10:43] true so the guy he had his Cadillac all
[1:10:47] prepared and they propped him up they
[1:10:49] got a crane and he went they dug the big
[1:10:52] old hole and he put him down it wasn't a
[1:10:54] coffin it was his Cadillac
[1:10:56] Man and they propped him up and he put
[1:11:00] him down into the hole and somebody said
[1:11:01] man what a way to
[1:11:04] go are you kidding
[1:11:07] me
[1:11:09] hey that's not a way to
[1:11:12] go no because he that hath the son hath
[1:11:16] life he that hath not the son listen
[1:11:19] that guy may think he's going to drive
[1:11:20] that Cadillac in the afterlife he's
[1:11:22] mistaken
[1:11:27] anyway now I want you to understand that
[1:11:29] there's three
[1:11:31] polls and to those of you who are not
[1:11:33] familiar with this message let me just
[1:11:36] say this that Jesus Christ himself had
[1:11:38] three
[1:11:39] PS he first started with
[1:11:43] healing and no one was offended by
[1:11:47] healing in fact they all come they
[1:11:49] wanted to see uh the lepers cleansed
[1:11:52] they wanted to see
[1:11:54] uh people's arms restored eyesight
[1:11:57] restored praise God thou would a man
[1:11:59] come from God because no man can do
[1:12:01] these things except that God be with him
[1:12:04] so again the healing Jesus and all kinds
[1:12:07] of Miracles then he turns into
[1:12:10] discernment where he starts telling and
[1:12:13] Discerning their hearts behold an
[1:12:16] Israelite in whom there is no God when
[1:12:18] did you know me when before your brother
[1:12:21] called you while you were under the Fig
[1:12:23] tree uh sycamore tree I saw you right
[1:12:27] amen that's right wow
[1:12:30] Rabbi he said just because I told you
[1:12:33] where you're from your name where I saw
[1:12:36] you he said greater things shall you
[1:12:39] see so then in a third poll and we know
[1:12:44] his ministry changes and this is very
[1:12:47] important for you to catch that the
[1:12:49] change of ministry and the change of
[1:12:52] administration it happens in every age
[1:12:54] and it's happening right now in this
[1:12:56] lisian age we're a part of it it's going
[1:12:59] on right now the ministry of Jesus
[1:13:04] Christ in this message did not stop when
[1:13:08] the voice of Malachi 4 ceased and he
[1:13:12] went off the
[1:13:15] scene we don't have to pray for a return
[1:13:18] Ministry in fact let me shock you it's
[1:13:20] not a return Ministry it's a
[1:13:22] continuation of the same Ministry but
[1:13:25] God changes
[1:13:27] Administration he changes his mask he
[1:13:29] goes from one to
[1:13:32] many are you following me so there's a
[1:13:35] change of administration if you miss
[1:13:39] that then then you're missing the whole
[1:13:41] thing we're changing right
[1:13:45] now into something right now that is a
[1:13:49] process and all of us are a part of it
[1:13:52] amen
[1:13:54] yes
[1:13:55] sir I don't want to get ahead of myself
[1:13:58] but let me bring to you a quote here in
[1:14:03] 1961 getting in the spirit we find out
[1:14:06] that God brought Elisha through the same
[1:14:08] process three different
[1:14:11] stages then after he left the school
[1:14:13] went down to Jordan crossed over Jordan
[1:14:15] then he had a double portion of Elijah
[1:14:18] Spirit was upon him now Jesus said these
[1:14:21] things shall I do shall you do also more
[1:14:24] than these shall you do for I go to the
[1:14:26] father this is the type of Christ and
[1:14:29] the church somebody say that's us Christ
[1:14:33] and the church Christ was taken up in
[1:14:36] the same spirit that was upon Christ
[1:14:38] came upon his church amen so here's the
[1:14:42] scenario I want you to understand Elisha
[1:14:46] tried Elijah tried to shake off
[1:14:50] Elisha how many of you know that
[1:14:54] you stay here I've got to
[1:14:56] go and Elijah kept saying oh no as the
[1:15:01] Lord God liveth I'm going with you so
[1:15:04] fine he goes from the first Pole to the
[1:15:06] second he said now you stay here I've
[1:15:08] got to go further oh no I want you to
[1:15:11] understand there comes times in your
[1:15:13] life God may just shake you up a little
[1:15:16] bit to see if you're going to stay and
[1:15:18] say okay okay go ahead and go I'll stay
[1:15:20] here I'm
[1:15:22] happy
[1:15:25] brother Bram said watch that first stage
[1:15:27] he said come into justification many say
[1:15:30] I'm happy with that I'm just happy to be
[1:15:32] justified I don't want anything to do
[1:15:34] with sanctification because then then my
[1:15:36] life I got to clean up my life oh my and
[1:15:38] then the gifts of the Spirit all know
[1:15:40] you see brother Rim said many will go to
[1:15:42] justification stay there many will go to
[1:15:45] sanctification stay there how many of
[1:15:48] you want to just keep going God do not
[1:15:52] as the Lord thy God liveth I'm going
[1:15:55] with you there's got to be a
[1:15:58] determination I'm not staying here try
[1:16:02] to shake him off Jesus tried shaking off
[1:16:05] his
[1:16:06] disciples does this offend you except
[1:16:09] you eat of My Flesh and drink of my
[1:16:11] blood this man's a
[1:16:13] cannibal he didn't go out there and and
[1:16:16] explain it to everybody no they sat
[1:16:18] there I can just imagine those disciples
[1:16:21] had gotten some of their friends and
[1:16:23] different ones maybe even relatives and
[1:16:25] said hey come on over I want you to hear
[1:16:27] Jesus of Nazareth and oh man uh maybe
[1:16:30] he's going to do mirales today and and
[1:16:33] and there's the crowd the whole
[1:16:34] multitude and they see him and and he
[1:16:37] he's walking out and everybody sh sh sh
[1:16:41] here he comes here he comes the master
[1:16:44] speaking everybody's looking except you
[1:16:48] eat my flesh and drink my
[1:16:50] blood you have no part with me right
[1:16:53] I can imagine Peter
[1:16:58] oh
[1:17:00] my why didn't you do a
[1:17:02] miracle get their attention first do
[1:17:06] some huh come on now let's bring it
[1:17:08] right on down to our day a lot of times
[1:17:11] I have different ones whether it be my
[1:17:13] family or some of you invite a neighbor
[1:17:15] a friend and guess what the pastor
[1:17:17] preaches a
[1:17:18] scorcher and you're going oh
[1:17:21] my why in the world of all
[1:17:27] services never forget the time I was
[1:17:30] overseas just a small group could have
[1:17:32] been more than 25 30
[1:17:34] people and man I was preaching and I was
[1:17:37] preaching on women cutting her hair and
[1:17:41] manicure and painted face and hoop
[1:17:44] earrings and guest sitting right on the
[1:17:46] front row right here
[1:17:49] painted
[1:17:51] fingernails hoop ear Rings short hair
[1:17:54] and she's looking right at
[1:17:57] me now I thought okay Lord I felt led to
[1:18:04] preach this this morning it is your word
[1:18:08] and if there eled maybe the way I
[1:18:10] present it I could offend him cuz it's
[1:18:13] true sometimes it is the way we approach
[1:18:16] someone but I was preaching I felt led
[1:18:19] of it you know what she never got upset
[1:18:21] her face didn't get red her nostrils
[1:18:24] didn't flare and she didn't get upset in
[1:18:26] fact she came to me right after the
[1:18:28] service and she said no one's ever
[1:18:30] preached this before I've never heard
[1:18:33] that but it Bears witness with
[1:18:36] me I've had some women for the first
[1:18:40] time never hearing about a woman cutting
[1:18:42] a hair and it's an Abomination before
[1:18:45] God and I've had shired women sit there
[1:18:47] and pull on their hair like okay grow
[1:18:50] grow I I wish it would grow right now
[1:18:53] that it would be like sister Megan's
[1:18:55] almost all the way down to the floor as
[1:18:57] she
[1:18:58] walks I thank God for those of you that
[1:19:02] have long hair because it's a glory unto
[1:19:04] you that's right so sometimes you don't
[1:19:08] have to try to explain it
[1:19:11] all
[1:19:13] see we're we're talking about this faith
[1:19:16] in this end time here right now for not
[1:19:18] just
[1:19:19] healing that's the children's bread but
[1:19:21] we want something that's going to be so
[1:19:24] stimulating so activating so quickening
[1:19:28] that you're going to be changed in a
[1:19:30] moment in a twinkling of an eye and I'm
[1:19:33] saying it's going on right now
[1:19:35] transformation is taking place right now
[1:19:38] line upon line precept upon precept here
[1:19:40] a little for the glory of the
[1:19:42] terrestrial is one thing but the glory
[1:19:45] of the celestial is far greater so what
[1:19:48] you did this past week what you did in
[1:19:50] your career and all the money you make
[1:19:52] it it's going to
[1:19:53] burn but what you're doing right now in
[1:19:56] the house of God your attitude towards
[1:19:59] the word may depend upon your Eternal
[1:20:04] destination Lord speak to our hearts
[1:20:07] this morning take the word and let the
[1:20:09] son of man be
[1:20:11] revealed thank
[1:20:14] youus God's beginning to move yes he is
[1:20:17] in his bride around the world it's
[1:20:21] happening it's moving and and it's a
[1:20:23] very
[1:20:24] subtle it's it huh some people are
[1:20:28] looking for some big Flash no it's here
[1:20:31] a little there a little God giving you
[1:20:34] in fact I'll be preaching on this I'm
[1:20:37] going to give you
[1:20:39] previews I show you through the life of
[1:20:41] Abraham and God Appears under Abraham in
[1:20:43] Genesis 12 and he builds an
[1:20:46] altar
[1:20:48] wow I want you to understand that every
[1:20:51] time God reveals himself to you it's an
[1:20:54] appearing every time that God reveals to
[1:20:57] you something from his word because he's
[1:21:01] always going to take you back to the
[1:21:03] word because that's his absolute so when
[1:21:05] he reveals to you something from the
[1:21:08] word it's an appearing and God appeared
[1:21:11] unto Abraham and he paid tithes God
[1:21:14] appeared unto Abraham and he built an
[1:21:16] alar and he worship God Appears to him
[1:21:19] and and he does things so the appearing
[1:21:22] of God when you come to church when
[1:21:24] you're at home when you're reading your
[1:21:27] Bible when you're alone when you're
[1:21:29] taking a walk in the park when God all
[1:21:31] of a sudden opens your eyes of
[1:21:37] understanding you should understand God
[1:21:40] is doing something and what he's doing
[1:21:42] he's taking a word attribute and he's
[1:21:45] pulling it out of
[1:21:46] you I want you to go to church he
[1:21:49] reveals it to you and he pulls it and
[1:21:51] you say Thank you Lord and you go to
[1:21:53] church Revelation that is not made
[1:21:56] manifest is only head
[1:22:00] knowledge got to be made

[1:27:54] time after the Resurrection The only
[1:27:57] thing the only miracle that Jesus does
[1:28:01] is open
[1:28:04] eyes that
[1:28:06] right so he's gone beyond the first and
[1:28:09] second PLL of his ministry he's not
[1:28:12] majoring on minors anymore so we got two
[1:28:15] on the road to
[1:28:16] EMAs and guess what the Lord has been
[1:28:20] crucified they're all upset they got
[1:28:22] long

[1:28:26] sad and the resurrected Lord Jesus the
[1:28:29] Bible says and he joined himself watch

[1:32:06] more that the Rapture is coming close
[1:32:09] and close and close and we're seeing the
[1:32:11] revealing of the son of man hey that's
[1:32:14] the only thing I'm interested in man I
[1:32:17] there something that gets me excited is
[1:32:19] going to get me out of here I don't want
[1:32:22] to stay here I don't want to be here
[1:32:24] when all of this stuff starts going on I
[1:32:27] don't want to be here when the pale
[1:32:28] horse rider starts to
[1:32:33] right amen amen amen now this new
[1:32:38] ministry it goes from a one man to a
[1:32:42] multi-member it goes from one man Jesus
[1:32:45] Christ to the day of Pentecost and the
[1:32:48] spirit of God now enters into them and
[1:32:51] when he the spirit of Truth is come do
[1:32:54] you see that when he the spirit of Truth
[1:32:56] has
[1:32:57] come he says he will guide you into all
[1:33:00] truth am and so there on the day of
[1:33:02] Pentecost the
[1:33:04] ministry was the same but it's changing
[1:33:07] who has it it's a new Administration and
[1:33:11] the devil was sitting there I got
[1:33:13] him I got him I thought I had him in the
[1:33:18] days of Moses I killed all the children
[1:33:21] I thought thought I had him and guess
[1:33:22] what he slipped through my fingers I
[1:33:25] thought I had him in the days when
[1:33:26] Christ was born I killed all the the
[1:33:29] newborn uh Sons I thought I had
[1:33:35] him and so when Christ was crucified I
[1:33:39] got him all I got to do is hold him
[1:33:42] three days that's all hey on the fourth
[1:33:45] day all I got to do is parade his body
[1:33:47] through Jerusalem and Christianity is
[1:33:50] over
[1:33:53] that's all they got to do but guess
[1:33:56] what the grave couldn't hold
[1:33:59] you hallelujah thank you
[1:34:03] Lord thank they went the disciples
[1:34:08] went they brought the spices to prepare
[1:34:11] the body because they couldn't finish it
[1:34:13] all before the Sabbath they're not
[1:34:16] expecting him to be
[1:34:19] risen and when they come
[1:34:22] and there they came to the tomb and when
[1:34:25] they do the stone is rolled away oh
[1:34:29] my what happened because it was set with
[1:34:34] a Roman seal do you know what you do
[1:34:36] with a Roman seal they take the tomb
[1:34:39] they take the the the the stone and they
[1:34:42] put a cement over it and one of the the
[1:34:45] authorities from Rome takes a seal and
[1:34:48] puts it in there and you don't break the
[1:34:50] seal let you deal with
[1:34:54] Rome and those guards huh we we we got
[1:34:57] some kind of weird understanding that
[1:35:00] these little guards that are standing
[1:35:02] there looking with their miniskirt on
[1:35:04] and their little phony helmets and and
[1:35:07] they're standing there trying to guard
[1:35:09] this tomb these are the Elite these are
[1:35:11] the fighting Green Beret of the Roman
[1:35:14] legion these guys are the top of the top
[1:35:19] and when an angel
[1:35:23] comes guess what they fall back as dead
[1:35:25] man you come into the presence of God
[1:35:29] you come into the presence of angelic
[1:35:31] beings Brother Band said whenever God
[1:35:33] comes by whenever he comes there and he
[1:35:36] said when that angel comes to me you
[1:35:38] would think that I'd be dancing and
[1:35:40] shouting he said it's fear it's
[1:35:42] trembling for two or three days he said
[1:35:44] I'm not even the same let me tell you my
[1:35:47] brother and my sister we tend to think
[1:35:49] that a lot of times when this a
[1:35:51] anointing comes that we're going to be
[1:35:53] jumping and shouting sometimes it's
[1:35:56] going to be to where it's under
[1:36:00] control brother look up the the quote
[1:36:03] huh brother Paul yeah Supreme
[1:36:08] anointing brother R said you you got it
[1:36:11] all
[1:36:13] backwards he
[1:36:14] said it's the word of God coming to you
[1:36:17] and it's revealed to you and it's under
[1:36:20] control
[1:36:25] amen the new ministry so watch this so
[1:36:27] they asked brother Brandon this question
[1:36:29] would a bride of Christ let's go to
[1:36:31] questions answer
[1:36:34] 63 would the bride of Christ have a
[1:36:36] Ministry before the
[1:36:40] Rapture
[1:36:42] sure that's what's going on right
[1:36:46] now the bride of Christ certainly it's
[1:36:48] the message of the hour the bride of
[1:36:51] Christ sure she consists of Apostles
[1:36:54] prophets
[1:36:55] evangelists teachers pastors is that
[1:36:58] right that's the bride of Christ sure
[1:37:01] she's got a Ministry great ministry it's
[1:37:03] the ministry of the hour it'll be so
[1:37:05] humble so when somebody tells you that
[1:37:07] you just press play they got something
[1:37:11] wrong it's not the word I'm sorry don't
[1:37:15] be
[1:37:19] deceived somebody told me the other day
[1:37:21] he well when we get into heaven when we
[1:37:24] get over there God's going to press play
[1:37:26] for you to are you kidding
[1:37:28] me brother renom says that God does not
[1:37:32] use mechanical devices to preach the
[1:37:35] gospel he's always used man in every age
[1:37:39] Whenever there was an issue whenever the
[1:37:41] people got away whenever Israel or
[1:37:43] anybody the children of God got away
[1:37:46] from things God sent them a tape
[1:37:50] recorder
[1:37:54] God sent him a man
[1:37:59] amen for God so loved the
[1:38:02] world he sent a
[1:38:05] man the son of man I want you to
[1:38:08] understand this revealing of the son of
[1:38:10] man
[1:38:11] continues he did not stop when the
[1:38:14] prophet of God went off the scene but
[1:38:17] guess what God's doing he's got a new
[1:38:19] Administration it's now just one that's
[1:38:22] right you see the devil said I got
[1:38:25] him but guess what on the day of
[1:38:28] Pentecost this same seed that went
[1:38:32] down and remember it's got to be planted
[1:38:34] it's got to
[1:38:37] corrupt and all of a sudden there comes
[1:38:40] a sound from heaven like a rushing
[1:38:43] Mighty Wind and the spirit of God falls
[1:38:46] upon each one of them and they are there
[1:38:48] waiting for the promise which is told
[1:38:51] them that they would come to them is
[1:38:52] that right they're waiting there am they
[1:38:56] weren't doing anything they didn't have
[1:38:57] the piano
[1:38:59] going they didn't have the song leer I
[1:39:01] think hey let's sing and we'll get Happ
[1:39:04] no they were sitting like what you're
[1:39:07] doing but the thing that they did do is
[1:39:09] they got into one mind and one Accord
[1:39:13] and they began to say God said stay here
[1:39:17] and carry until you were ued with power
[1:39:22] power is something and guess what is the
[1:39:25] power of
[1:39:27] transformation Faith you're not getting
[1:39:30] transformed you're not getting out of
[1:39:32] here you're not getting raptured unless
[1:39:34] it's Faith doing it in you
[1:39:38] amen for by grace are you
[1:39:42] saved through
[1:39:44] faith and it being a gift of God not of
[1:39:49] yourselves it's not the The Works you do
[1:39:51] lest any man boast I guarantee you when
[1:39:55] we get over there and we all go through
[1:39:57] those ply Gates there's not going to be
[1:40:00] any one of us saying open up ye gates
[1:40:03] you
[1:40:04] Everlasting let me in because I was the
[1:40:06] best guy and
[1:40:09] loua I deserve it I was in
[1:40:12] church I never said a cuss word I never
[1:40:15] thought a bad thought hey God open up
[1:40:18] I'm going in uhuh you know what we're
[1:40:21] all going to be doing oh God oh God by
[1:40:25] grace and the thing that I think that
[1:40:27] excites me is when we get all over there
[1:40:30] do you know why God's going to allow us
[1:40:31] to be here on Earth on Earth 30 to 40
[1:40:34] days before the
[1:40:36] resurrection huh before the catching
[1:40:38] away I should say but during this time
[1:40:40] 30 to 40 days okay because when we go up
[1:40:45] and he takes us there he doesn't want
[1:40:47] any of you looking oh hey did Ron make
[1:40:50] it
[1:40:52] you he do hey hey did Ron make it now
[1:40:55] he's not going to have any of you
[1:40:56] looking around
[1:40:59] huh so 30 to 40 days we have here so we
[1:41:02] can gather together he made it he made
[1:41:04] it wow and there going to be people that
[1:41:06] are going to walk through and all of a
[1:41:08] sudden you're going to go oh
[1:41:10] wow he made it she made it but the thing
[1:41:16] that's really going to be humbling to
[1:41:19] you is when you walk through people are
[1:41:21] going to
[1:41:25] go now I know there's
[1:41:28] Grace how many of you can say Amen to
[1:41:31] that because you realize it wasn't
[1:41:33] anything you did it was God by his grace
[1:41:36] his Sovereign power huh you are elected
[1:41:39] you are
[1:41:40] predestinated that third pole the
[1:41:42] revealing of the son of man he tried
[1:41:44] shaking you up but you like a bulldog
[1:41:47] wouldn't go he tried to send you down he
[1:41:50] tried tried to put his fan upon he tried
[1:41:53] to purge you he tried to get you to quit
[1:41:56] but you said I'm sitting right here I'm
[1:41:59] elected I'm chosen of God and I don't
[1:42:02] care I may not understand it but I
[1:42:04] believe
[1:42:05] [Applause]
[1:42:07] it somebody give him praise this
[1:42:17] morning it's not a return
[1:42:19] Ministry it's because the ministry never
[1:42:23] left it just
[1:42:25] changed changed its mess God in
[1:42:28] morha now it's God in you this mystery

[1:53:01] amen hallelujah you can't shake them
[1:53:04] on brother Bram said when I was a young
[1:53:07] boy he
[1:53:09] said we thought we all knew how to swim
[1:53:12] we go down to that old muddy Lake we
[1:53:14] pull the nail our overalls drop we get
[1:53:18] in that muddy pool and we start look at
[1:53:20] me I'm swimming he said what we're doing
[1:53:23] splashing more water out of the
[1:53:26] pond he said but when
[1:53:29] later he said when I learned to
[1:53:31] stroke when I learned how to swim it
[1:53:34] wasn't splashing it wasn't this and that
[1:53:36] you see in his early Ministry look at me
[1:53:38] I'll tell you what I'm going to pray for
[1:53:40] people I'm going to stay four or six
[1:53:42] days I'm not even going to leave the
[1:53:43] pulpit I'm going to stay here I'm going
[1:53:44] to pray and tell everybody until there
[1:53:46] was thousands upon thousands and you
[1:53:48] know what it did it got him a nervous
[1:53:51] breakdown he had to go off the ministry
[1:53:53] for 18
[1:53:55] months you see it's not it's not trying
[1:53:57] to pray for everybody I'm I'm bringing
[1:53:59] this somewhere now I the Apostle Paul
[1:54:02] said look I want to take you un to
[1:54:04] Perfection I want to go beyond all this
[1:54:07] laying on of hands and of water baptism
[1:54:09] and all of this stuff I want to go onto
[1:54:12] something hard far higher I want you to
[1:54:14] understand that's what the Apostle Paul
[1:54:16] was doing that's why he was hard to be
[1:54:18] misunderstood he is so easily to be
[1:54:20] misunderstood because he's trying to get
[1:54:22] the people to understand it's by
[1:54:27] faith I want to go beyond these
[1:54:30] things and he said and we'll do it if
[1:54:33] God will
[1:54:34] permit loud you see in church
[1:54:37] age page
[1:54:39] 339 he quotes revelations 10:7 in the
[1:54:43] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:54:45] seventh messenger when he shall begin to
[1:54:47] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:54:50] finished as he is declared to a Servants
[1:54:51] of prophets there it is he is sending a
[1:54:55] Vindicated prophet he is sending a
[1:54:57] prophet from after almost 2,000 years
[1:55:02] he's sending someone who is far from
[1:55:04] organization education in the world of
[1:55:07] religion as John the Baptist and of
[1:55:09] Elijah of old and he will hear only from
[1:55:11] God he will have thus sayith the Lord
[1:55:15] and speak for God he will be God's
[1:55:18] mouthpiece as he
[1:55:20] and it is declared in Malachi 4:6 will
[1:55:23] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:55:25] the fathers he will bring back the elect
[1:55:27] of the last day watch this God's
[1:55:31] messenger he'll bring back the elect of
[1:55:33] the last day and they will hear a
[1:55:35] Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth
[1:55:38] as it was with
[1:55:39] Paul he will restore the truth as they
[1:55:42] had it and those elect with him in that
[1:55:44] day will be the ones who truly manifest
[1:55:47] the Lord and be his body and be his
[1:55:50] voice and perform his works somebody say
[1:55:53] hallelujah hallelujah change of ministry
[1:55:57] if there is a change of ministry there's
[1:55:59] got to be a change of
[1:56:00] administration you understand it now
[1:56:02] watch this brother Braham said and we
[1:56:04] would see Jesus
[1:56:06] 1962 the levitical priesthood ceased at
[1:56:09] the death of the Lord
[1:56:12] Jesus levitical
[1:56:15] priesthood that was ordained of God set
[1:56:17] up by Moses himself
[1:56:20] it
[1:56:21] ceased at the death of the Lord Jesus
[1:56:24] now we live in the mezic
[1:56:27] priesthood Christ now we still are not
[1:56:32] without AUM
[1:56:34] Thum this is it
[1:56:36] now the
[1:56:40] Bible amen God changed the
[1:56:45] ministry with a new Administration watch
[1:56:49] this though it's the same
[1:56:50] Ministry remember I gave you the quote
[1:56:52] brother brm said I thought he'd
[1:56:55] change the ministry he said no no the
[1:56:58] ministry is the same but he changes the
[1:57:00] man with the
[1:57:01] ministry okay now I want to give you a
[1:57:04] graph here I want to show you to show
[1:57:06] you something here look at this left
[1:57:09] side the old
[1:57:11] priesthood the litical priesthood and
[1:57:14] the ironic priesthood the temple was a
[1:57:17] building made with hands but but when it
[1:57:20] changes the temple is the body of the
[1:57:23] New Covenant Believers in Christ know
[1:57:26] you not that you are the temple so watch
[1:57:29] it changing watch same Ministry new
[1:57:33] Administration so the old sacrifice was
[1:57:37] an
[1:57:38] animal the final sacrifice was Jesus
[1:57:41] Christ Behold the
[1:57:43] Lamb the offerings before in the Old
[1:57:47] Testament were animals but the blood of
[1:57:50] bulls and goats does not do away with
[1:57:53] sin so now the offerings are now
[1:57:56] presenting
[1:57:57] ourselves as living
[1:58:00] sacrifices tithing and offering and a
[1:58:04] sacrifice of
[1:58:08] praise there was access in the Old
[1:58:10] Testament to the holy of holies was
[1:58:12] restricted to the high priest alone once
[1:58:15] a
[1:58:17] year here actually access to the holy h
[1:58:20] of holies is available to all believers
[1:58:25] wow see the
[1:58:27] change prayers were prayed at the temple
[1:58:30] in the name of the god of Abraham Isaac
[1:58:32] and Jacob but when it changes prayers
[1:58:35] are prayed in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:58:39] Hallelujah the priesthood was after the
[1:58:42] order of
[1:58:43] Aaron but the priesthood has changed now
[1:58:48] after the order of M
[1:58:50] Jesus who is our high priest amen oh my
[1:58:56] 1 Corinthians
[1:58:57] 2 musicians have you
[1:59:00] come my my
[1:59:02] myk you Lord I'm going to go a little
[1:59:05] bit further got lay a foundation for our
[1:59:08] next
[1:59:10] service 1 Corinthians 2: 12 through1 13
[1:59:14] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:59:17] the
[1:59:18] world but the spirit which is of
[1:59:21] god that we might know the things which
[1:59:24] are freely given to us of
[1:59:27] God which things also we speak not in
[1:59:31] The Words which man's Wisdom
[1:59:34] teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[1:59:38] teacheth comparing spiritual
[1:59:41] things with
[1:59:44] spiritual so when we look at the change
[1:59:47] of administration we have to bring it
[1:59:48] down to our our day we have to see the
[1:59:51] ministry it continues but it changes
[1:59:55] Administration now a lot of us read
[1:59:57] Revelations 10 1-7 and we don't look at
[2:00:01] the change of administration but I'm
[2:00:02] going to show you so we're going to
[2:00:04] follow along in scripture Revelations 10
[2:00:09] 7-1 but in the days of the voice of the
[2:00:11] seventh
[2:00:13] angel when he shall begin to sound now
[2:00:16] brother Bram said not when he starts his
[2:00:18] ministry not in the first and second
[2:00:20] pull but he said when that third pull
[2:00:23] Ministry begins to sound and the
[2:00:25] revealing of the son of
[2:00:28] man the mystery of God should be
[2:00:30] finished as Heath declared to his
[2:00:32] servants of prophets and the voice which
[2:00:34] I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[2:00:37] again and said go and take the little
[2:00:39] book which is open in the hand of the
[2:00:41] Angel which standeth upon the seat and
[2:00:43] upon the
[2:00:45] Earth and I went unto the angel and I
[2:00:47] said unto him please oh kind Angel would
[2:00:50] you kindly give me the
[2:00:56] book remember in Revelations chap 5 no
[2:00:59] one's worthy to take the book nor to
[2:01:01] look there
[2:01:02] on no one in heaven and Earth found
[2:01:06] worthy but now in Revelations
[2:01:09] 10 give me the
[2:01:12] book give me that little
[2:01:15] book and he said unto me take it and eat
[2:01:18] it up so he had this book in his hand he
[2:01:22] said give me the little book and he said
[2:01:24] okay you take it now you eat it don't
[2:01:26] you take these tapes and books and this
[2:01:29] revealed word of the hour and put it on
[2:01:31] a shelf you read it you assimilated you
[2:01:36] listen you go home and you listen to
[2:01:38] those
[2:01:40] tapes tapes do not replace going to
[2:01:44] church you listen to the tapes so that
[2:01:47] when you come to church CH that I'll be
[2:01:50] saying what he said cuz you you'll be
[2:01:52] saying I heard that on tape that's
[2:01:55] nothing but the
[2:01:58] truth give me the little book take it
[2:02:01] eat it
[2:02:02] up it shall make thy belly
[2:02:05] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[2:02:08] sweet as honey and I took the little
[2:02:10] book out of the Angel's hand I ate it up
[2:02:12] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[2:02:14] and as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[2:02:17] was bitter he said said unto me thou now
[2:02:21] watch this
[2:02:24] before it was the prophecy of the
[2:02:28] seventh
[2:02:29] angel when he should begin to sound now
[2:02:32] there's another
[2:02:33] sounding do you understand the
[2:02:35] administration
[2:02:38] changes will the bride have a Ministry
[2:02:40] yeah yeah sure uhhuh it's going on now

[2:02:52] peoples and Nations tongues and Kings no
[2:02:56] longer one Ministry it's a multi-member
[2:02:59] Ministry the change of ministry must
[2:03:02] bring with it a new
[2:03:05] Administration that's what's going on
[2:03:07] right now that third
[2:03:12] poll faith is that super sense it's the
[2:03:17] revealing of the son son of a
[2:03:20] man let me show you let me go on just a
[2:03:24] little bit in Matthew chapter
[2:03:29] 15 verses 21-
[2:03:32] 28 then Jesus went then and departed in
[2:03:35] the coast of Ty and
[2:03:37] siden behold a woman of
[2:03:40] Canaan came out of the same coast and
[2:03:43] Cried unto
[2:03:45] him now she's from Canaan she's a
[2:03:48] gentile
[2:03:49] she is not
[2:03:52] Jew are we
[2:03:55] [Music]
[2:03:58] together she Cried unto
[2:04:01] him have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of
[2:04:05] David my daughter is grievously vexed
[2:04:08] with the
[2:04:10] devil she at least recognized it was a
[2:04:13] spirit today we call it all well they
[2:04:16] got PTSD they got
[2:04:19] uh some kind of whatever we put doctor
[2:04:22] names to it's a
[2:04:25] devil have mercy on me thou son of David
[2:04:28] now she's coming to him as a
[2:04:32] Jew son of David to her he's not son of
[2:04:37] David but he answered her not a
[2:04:41] word and his disciples came and besought
[2:04:44] him saying send her away she cries after
[2:04:47] us but he answered said I am not sent
[2:04:51] but under the lost sheep of the House of
[2:04:53] Israel wow I got nothing to do with this
[2:04:58] [Music]
[2:04:59] woman then came she and worshiped
[2:05:03] him saying
[2:05:07] Lord help
[2:05:09] me
[2:05:11] Lord not thou son of David Lord she's
[2:05:15] coming as a gentile now
[2:05:17] Lord
[2:05:19] would you help
[2:05:21] me and he answered it is not me to take
[2:05:24] the children's bread and to cast it to
[2:05:29] dogs she said truth
[2:05:32] Lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs which
[2:05:35] fall from their master's
[2:05:37] table then Jesus answered and said unto
[2:05:40] her oh
[2:05:41] woman
[2:05:43] great is thy
[2:05:45] faith be it unto thee as thou will you
[2:05:50] see the
[2:05:52] Gentile who touched
[2:05:54] me who touched me she didn't touch
[2:06:00] him
[2:06:01] physically she's touching him by
[2:06:06] [Music]
[2:06:09] faith understand this she was catching
[2:06:12] the son of man
[2:06:13] Ministry in Jesus Christ she was a
[2:06:17] gentile reaching out
[2:06:19] she's catching
[2:06:21] something now let me show you the
[2:06:24] comparison now Jew Gentile go to Mark 5
[2:06:28] watch this Mark 5: 211 and 34 and when
[2:06:33] Jesus
[2:06:34] passed over again by ship under the
[2:06:36] other side much people gathered unto him
[2:06:38] and he was nigh Under the Sea behold
[2:06:41] there cometh one of the rulers of the
[2:06:44] synagogue gyrus by name and when he saw
[2:06:48] him he he fell at his feet so gyrus is
[2:06:50] from a synagogue so he's a what he's a
[2:06:54] Jew
[2:06:58] right and besought him greatly my
[2:07:00] daughter lith at the point of death I
[2:07:03] pray thee come and lay thy hands on her
[2:07:06] remember brother brm said it's a Jewish
[2:07:08] custom to have hands laid on you it's
[2:07:10] what he said you all know that we've
[2:07:13] seen the
[2:07:14] quotes that she might be
[2:07:16] healed and she shall live and Jesus went
[2:07:19] with him and among people followed him
[2:07:21] and thronged him and a certain woman
[2:07:23] hears somebody else coming he's on his
[2:07:27] way to the home of
[2:07:30] gyrus there was a woman who had an issue
[2:07:32] of blood for 12
[2:07:34] years and has suffered many things with
[2:07:36] many Physicians had spent all she had
[2:07:40] and was nothing better but rather grew
[2:07:44] worse and when she heard of
[2:07:47] Jesus she came in the press behind and
[2:07:49] touched His
[2:07:51] Garment for she said watch this power of
[2:07:55] spoken word watch watch what she's doing
[2:07:59] she
[2:08:00] says if I may touch but his
[2:08:03] clothes I shall be healed I shall be
[2:08:07] whole and straight way the Fountain of
[2:08:09] her blood was dried up and she felt in
[2:08:11] her body that she was healed of that
[2:08:14] plague and Jesus immediately knowing in
[2:08:17] himself virtue at gone out of
[2:08:19] him turned about under the press and
[2:08:22] said who touched my clothes now wait
[2:08:25] just a second I'm going to stop here and
[2:08:26] I'm going to ask you guys something I
[2:08:28] thought he's all all
[2:08:30] knowing I thought he knows the secrets
[2:08:33] and intents of the heart why would he
[2:08:35] say who touched my
[2:08:37] clothes as though he couldn't find out
[2:08:40] as though he didn't you know what he's
[2:08:43] getting all of them to understand
[2:08:45] somebody has touched me here and it's
[2:08:49] different virtue has gone out of me who
[2:08:51] touched my clothes I want to ask you
[2:08:55] when God came down in the cool of the
[2:08:57] evening and was seeking Adam and Eve and
[2:09:00] they had sinned and they were run and
[2:09:03] hiding and and and God came down and he
[2:09:06] walked among the garden there Adam where
[2:09:09] are you wait a second it don't make
[2:09:12] sense of God who's all
[2:09:14] knowing would ask where are you
[2:09:17] Adam
[2:09:18] he's asking Adam Adam what are you
[2:09:23] doing why are you under this condition
[2:09:25] did you eat of that tree that I told you
[2:09:27] not
[2:09:27] to understand when he says who has
[2:09:30] touched my
[2:09:32] clothes he knows who touching me he's
[2:09:34] just wanting them to confess and for the
[2:09:37] rest of them to catch that somebody
[2:09:40] touched him
[2:09:43] different I'm going to build on this for
[2:09:45] our next
[2:09:47] service
[2:09:49] and a woman fearing and trembling
[2:09:52] knowing what was done in her came and
[2:09:53] fell down before him and told him all
[2:09:55] the
[2:09:56] truth and he said unto her
[2:10:00] daughter thy faith has made thee whole
[2:10:04] go in peace and be whole of thy
[2:10:09] [Music]
[2:10:13] plague I'm going to stop with this last
[2:10:15] verse but here I'm going to launch out
[2:10:17] on my next
[2:10:19] service I want all of you to understand
[2:10:22] this Psalms
[2:10:24] 107: 19 and
[2:10:28] 20 then they cry unto the Lord in their
[2:10:32] trouble and he saveth them out of their
[2:10:35] distresses he sent his
[2:10:38] word and healed
[2:10:42] them and delivered them from their
[2:10:46] distrs what did he send
[2:10:50] word I want you to understand that when
[2:10:52] he sent the word and you catch a
[2:10:55] revelation of that revealed word what is
[2:10:58] it it's a revealing of the son of man
[2:11:00] when you catch that guess what there's
[2:11:04] Deliverance there's
[2:11:06] healing huh there's
[2:11:08] adoption all of this what is it it's a
[2:11:11] revealing to you who is this brother
[2:11:14] renom are you the son of
[2:11:16] man are you the one
[2:11:20] he lived so Godly before the people some
[2:11:22] of them mistook him for Jesus Christ how
[2:11:25] about you have you lived so Godly before
[2:11:28] people said are you
[2:11:32] him he said no I'm an example of the
[2:11:35] example I'm a son of
[2:11:38] man revealing to
[2:11:40] you the son of
[2:11:42] man it was not William
[2:11:45] brandom it was not his message
[2:11:50] I I got into
[2:11:53] a a talk a nice
[2:11:57] discussion with Joseph Brenan one
[2:12:00] day okay because he said hey we have a
[2:12:03] copyright on this message I said how do
[2:12:05] you copyright what's God's
[2:12:08] amen I said if this was your daddy's
[2:12:11] message you have every right to every
[2:12:13] royalty and I said copyright it and then
[2:12:16] charge everybody to get it
[2:12:20] I said how do you copyright the word of
[2:12:22] God I said your daddy said I got no more
[2:12:25] to do with this message than nothing I
[2:12:27] just happen to be the one who yields
[2:12:30] myself it's no longer my voice it's his
[2:12:33] voice I said so change the name from
[2:12:35] voice of God it's not voice of God it's
[2:12:38] voice of William brandham and you got
[2:12:40] every right to every royalty of
[2:12:42] everything he ever preached I said but
[2:12:44] I'll tell you what this message was not
[2:12:47] his amen amen who was it revealing of
[2:12:51] the son of man when you listen to them
[2:12:54] tapes you're not listening to the
[2:12:56] prophet oh there are some that just hear
[2:12:58] hear his voice and that's it and go no
[2:13:01] further some get offended and go away
[2:13:04] from it why this man takes too much
[2:13:06] authority to himself uhhuh go ahead

[2:13:23] every time one leaves it seems like two
[2:13:25] more
[2:13:27] come I'm thinking oh God here we are at
[2:13:30] the end
[2:13:34] time he said who touched
[2:13:36] [Music]
[2:13:38] me do you know that while the word is
