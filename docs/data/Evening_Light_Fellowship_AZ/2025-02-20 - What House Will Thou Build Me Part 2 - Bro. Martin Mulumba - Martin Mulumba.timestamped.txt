[30:49] musicians thank you once again Church of
[30:52] the Living God to be present uh in the
[30:57] house of the Lord to share a moment of
[30:59] the word and thank you brother Ron for
[31:02] the trust and to allowing
[31:07] us quite uh repeatedly to come to the
[31:11] pulpit it has never looked at as granted
[31:15] but we believe that by God's
[31:18] grace uh one step at a time and when you
[31:23] spend the time with the prophet you look
[31:25] at the way he grew in the world word and
[31:29] it just makes us realize how humble we
[31:31] are to be when we stand in these
[31:34] places shall we take the book of uh
[31:38] Exodus 12 verse
[31:41] 33-
[31:45] 36 uh the Bible says and the Egyptians
[31:49] were urgent upon the people that they
[31:52] might send them out of the land in haste
[31:56] and they say we we be all dead men and
[31:59] the people took the door before it was
[32:02] leaven and the de door th being bound up
[32:05] in their clothes upon the shoulders and
[32:08] the children of Israel did according to
[32:10] the word of Moses and they borrowed of
[32:13] the the Egyptian Jewels silver and
[32:15] jewels of gold and Remnant and the lord
[32:18] gave the people favor in the sight of
[32:20] the Egyptians so that they lent unto
[32:23] them such things as they required and
[32:27] they spoke the Egyptians may the Lord
[32:29] bless the reading of his word you may be
[32:32] seated uh
[32:35] surely i' like uh to continue once again
[32:40] with uh the little Siri that the Lord
[32:43] has put on my
[32:44] heart what house will thou build me and
[32:49] uh continuing on that IID like to take
[32:51] uh a subject here Ministry of the
[32:55] sanctuary uh want to keep
[32:58] the eyes focus on that we started with
[33:01] uh choosing among the flocks what lamb
[33:07] that we are to choose and how do we
[33:10] proceed with uh such element believing
[33:15] and understanding that uh the lamb that
[33:18] we are pointing to is not a natural lamb
[33:21] or or a physical lamb that we come
[33:24] across about but we understand that the
[33:26] lamb is the Lord Jesus Christ or the
[33:29] word of the Living God that we are
[33:32] addressing about because of the word of
[33:35] the ministry because of uh how the Lord
[33:39] was Leading the People he spoke with uh
[33:42] Moses and told him that you go and free
[33:45] my people and they have to come and
[33:47] worship me in this mountain and this
[33:50] very place and uh the Lord uh I was uh
[33:54] quite
[33:55] nervous as I said that you know the more
[33:58] you deal with the prophet the more
[34:00] humble you are because I believe until
[34:03] yesterday I didn't know what route to
[34:07] take because I had uh pieces of the
[34:10] puzzle all over the place and uh I
[34:13] Believe by God's grace and I happen uh
[34:18] very late probably around 9 or 10 p.m.
[34:22] yesterday uh driving around
[34:24] and then it's almost like I was cut off
[34:28] from the rest of the world and and all
[34:31] of a sudden he says take Exodus 12 amen
[34:35] and I came I so rejoicing I say yeah
[34:38] yeah yeah yeah i' I have I have an
[34:41] experience on this and uh I I went home
[34:45] and and I told my wife I said yeah and I
[34:48] told him the experience and they said
[34:51] but you already preach on Exodus 12 then
[34:53] I get stressed
[34:54] again I say I say how am I going to deal
[34:58] with this then then I went quickly to to
[35:01] the Bible and before I know it I was
[35:03] like yeah he's always right amen yeah he
[35:06] doesn't he doesn't repeat things and
[35:10] stuff but is a that's why I say you can
[35:14] it it makes you humble yeah you can brag
[35:17] about these things that you know you
[35:19] know this you know that it's it's not
[35:21] it's nothing intellectual yeah it's it's
[35:24] nothing knowledge and trying to impress
[35:27] the Church in any shape or form is you
[35:31] he knows what the church needs and why
[35:34] have it has to be as at that
[35:37] moment uh the Lord brought the children
[35:41] of Israel under under uh 10th plague the
[35:47] people of Egypt said enough is enough
[35:51] the people have to leave but in the
[35:53] scope of uh what house will thou build
[35:56] me at this time we
[35:58] understand that these people were coming
[36:00] out to come and build the loads a
[36:04] tabernacle uh as they were coming out to
[36:08] build the Lord's Tabernacle the Bible
[36:10] shows us that they had need of certain
[36:13] materials they had need of certain
[36:16] elements to to be brought together and
[36:20] as they were preparing under the
[36:21] Passover we understand that without
[36:23] shedding of the blood there's no
[36:25] remission of sin there's no worship
[36:27] there's nothing nothing there's no
[36:28] relationship with God everything begins
[36:31] with the shedding of the blood and the
[36:33] blood of the Lamb gives opens the way
[36:36] because he's the one that went on before
[36:39] us and he he had opened the way he took
[36:42] the children of Israel out of Egypt and
[36:45] said that that and the people took their
[36:48] door before it was leaven they had all
[36:52] type of element we see type of silver
[36:56] gold and all kind of uh um things that
[37:01] uh they thought he was good for them to
[37:04] carry over because understanding that
[37:07] the children of Israel were in Egypt for
[37:09] 400 years you understand that they
[37:12] understanding the culture the perception
[37:14] everything it was according to the
[37:16] Egyptians and after all these
[37:19] Generations they felt more comfortable
[37:22] if anything that was of the Egyptians
[37:25] than anything that they were going to be
[37:28] that is in the world to come so it is
[37:30] with the Church of the Living God as we
[37:33] coming across surely we come uh from a
[37:37] different backgrounds and different
[37:39] understanding of life and things proven
[37:43] that we think that you know this is our
[37:45] way this is who I am and we and if
[37:50] whenever this happen to be a change in
[37:52] our lives we don't like it it's say like
[37:54] you no no no no no no I don't want that
[37:56] you know I'm conf with this and and this
[37:59] is who I am and stand strong and be
[38:01] confident in yourself but then that's
[38:04] not what the Lord was looking for and in
[38:07] Exodus 25 uh after they came out of the
[38:11] land of Egypt and they took all these
[38:15] things in Exodus 25 it says and the Lord
[38:18] spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the
[38:21] children of Israel that they may they
[38:24] bring me an offering of every every man
[38:28] that giveth it
[38:30] willingly to build the Lord's
[38:35] Tabernacle is not pushing
[38:38] us to be able to do that because
[38:40] remember his language when we started he
[38:43] say like you know off your own choosing
[38:45] pick from the
[38:46] flocks from the goats and the sheep and
[38:50] again he comes here and say like you
[38:52] know you choose yourself willingly
[38:55] you've chosen to follow this path
[38:57] pathway I've shed the blood because you
[39:00] chose me as the one but nevertheless in
[39:03] this stage of the journey you bring or
[39:06] you bring what you have willingly amen
[39:09] and every one of us according to our
[39:11] background we come as we
[39:14] are we come with our confidence our
[39:17] knowledge in technology our ability to
[39:19] play music and all these things the Lord
[39:23] said bring it to me willingly
[39:27] yes sir and this willingness will help
[39:30] in order to build the Tabernacle that
[39:33] the Lords
[39:34] want because if it's a force or if it's
[39:38] a a colonization type of thing
[39:41] then that there's no life behind it
[39:46] right otherwise it's like you know oh
[39:48] they come and they told us you have to
[39:51] have this long hair you have to cut the
[39:53] hair this way you have to speak this way
[39:56] you have to have this accent then it's
[39:59] not
[40:02] willingly as the Lord is coming down to
[40:05] speak with the children of Israel is
[40:08] looking he has something that he has
[40:11] dealt and told Abraham that I shall
[40:16] fulfill they were under consideration to
[40:19] come and fulfill this
[40:22] promise but then the Lord said like you
[40:24] know hey I
[40:25] know it is my
[40:28] Vision it is my
[40:30] program but you have to do it
[40:35] willingly give it willingly with his
[40:37] heart you shall take my offering and
[40:40] this is the offering you shall take from
[40:43] uh you shall take of them Gold Silver
[40:46] and brass and it just happened that
[40:48] these are the same things that they took
[40:50] from the
[40:53] Egyptians the lord gave them favor to
[40:56] get all this silver and gold from the
[40:58] Egyptians and here the Lord is said like
[41:00] you know bring it to me
[41:03] too you go to work and you make some
[41:06] money say like you know hey just give me
[41:07] a percent of what you're
[41:10] getting
[41:13] willingly nobody's coming to look at the
[41:15] pay Tab and say like you know you should
[41:17] pay this
[41:19] much nobody is looking into your
[41:21] business did you declare all this
[41:22] shareholders dividends and distribution
[41:25] as you should
[41:28] but he said do it willingly amen then it
[41:33] requires it shows us that it's not just
[41:36] the outward appearing of coming to this
[41:39] congregation it's not just the saying
[41:41] but it also the
[41:43] heart the condition of the heart must be
[41:47] ready in order to do this service unto
[41:50] the
[41:52] Lord the Lord is giving silver
[41:56] physically the Lord is giving
[41:58] understanding in the mind and the Lord
[42:00] is also looking for the heart to be
[42:04] willing so the heart must be a converted
[42:09] heart if it's not a converted heart then
[42:12] we have struggled with the mind and the
[42:15] body will be subjected to all kind of
[42:18] things and here we are and said like you
[42:20] know let them bring and blue and purple
[42:23] and verse 8 it says let them make me a
[42:26] centur
[42:28] that I may dwell among
[42:30] them according to all that I should
[42:35] after the pardon of the
[42:37] Tabernacle and the pardon of all the
[42:39] instrument thereof even so shall ye make
[42:43] it amen the Lord is calling them bring
[42:48] all these tools that you have all these
[42:51] elements that you have each one of us
[42:54] your background bring it
[42:58] your understanding bring
[43:00] it your perception bring
[43:03] it and he is the one now to take your
[43:07] perception and put it exactly way he
[43:11] thinks that it should go
[43:14] amen because if it's only you bringing
[43:18] your own perception according
[43:20] to I don't want what the Lord is telling
[43:24] me to do just as can the Lord said do
[43:28] like your
[43:29] brother you have the strength you have
[43:32] the ability you have the understanding
[43:34] but do like your brother he didn't want
[43:37] to amen he didn't have a willing heart
[43:41] that's true to follow what God was
[43:43] telling him and the Lord said like you
[43:46] know let them make me a
[43:49] sanctuary and now this making of the
[43:52] sanctuary is not according to the man
[43:55] himself coming around they said like you
[43:57] know oh K is said like you know I'll
[43:59] make a beautiful
[44:01] altar I'll make put flowers I'll put it
[44:05] in this manner it will look like this he
[44:08] said no according to the pardon that
[44:11] I've shown unto you
[44:13] amen it required a prophet in the
[44:17] land in order to get the PDN of the
[44:21] Tabernacle to bring it among the people
[44:25] so the people with their willing
[44:29] offering they can build the
[44:33] Tabernacle that's why I'm talking about
[44:36] what house will thou build
[44:40] me because if we building this house
[44:44] according to human
[44:46] understanding if it's not according to
[44:48] this
[44:49] paron and if we don't have access to the
[44:52] PN how shall we
[44:54] build because David was willing himself
[44:58] also to build the Tabernacle but the
[45:01] Lord said no no no no you've shed so
[45:03] many much blood it's your son that will
[45:06] do
[45:07] it but then unto whom the Lord has
[45:11] chosen to do this work is a privileged
[45:15] person yes sir but then at times even
[45:19] that privilege people look over it and
[45:22] they think like they're
[45:24] smarter they can do better than God
[45:27] they think that you know this life is
[45:29] just a way of them like you know I am
[45:33] this way I can do it my way I will say
[45:37] what I want I will live the way you want
[45:39] I want yes of course you will do
[45:43] that but there's an end to it
[45:47] amen but then unto the
[45:50] bride the Lord is showing them what is
[45:54] the PDN yes sir a tabernacle met out out
[45:57] of three parts the physical part that we
[46:01] see the most holy uh the the holy place
[46:04] that we don't
[46:05] see and the holy of holies behind the
[46:09] veil that you cannot see unless you are
[46:12] given access to get in that
[46:16] place brother Bram says nobody has ever
[46:19] seen William
[46:21] Brenham you only looking at the
[46:23] representation of it you only looking at
[46:26] the negative of
[46:28] him because the negative the positive
[46:31] behold the father's
[46:33] face and this Tabernacle that the Lord
[46:36] is building it said like you know the
[46:39] outer coat the uh the holy place and the
[46:42] holy of holies all of this has to be
[46:45] built according to the pardon
[46:50] amen yet we see that the out coat is
[46:55] made out of the materials that they
[46:58] received from the
[47:02] Egyptians and all these things now has
[47:05] they coming into the house of the Lord
[47:07] in the presence of the Lord the Lord
[47:09] said these elements I'm going to use
[47:12] them according to my vision to my
[47:17] pattern to what I have shown you
[47:20] Moses as the prophet had seen the vision
[47:23] of the Bride it said like you know I see
[47:25] the bride from Every Nation wearing
[47:29] according to the
[47:33] Nations as they were dressing up it was
[47:36] not as something that we come and say
[47:38] like you know brother uh David now from
[47:41] this day you start you should now start
[47:43] wearing a dressing like the Western
[47:46] people no even the angel of the Lord
[47:50] coming to the prophet on a physical is a
[47:54] physical appearance it didn't show show
[47:57] up as the people of the western people
[48:00] but he showed up as the Eastern
[48:04] people many times the angel of the Lord
[48:07] will take those shap and form and then
[48:09] we reject it because we are we have
[48:12] conceptualize how the word of God should
[48:15] come to
[48:17] us because of that perception then God's
[48:21] program can move
[48:22] forward and because of that said you
[48:25] know I wasn't expecting that to come
[48:27] that way I'm used to it this
[48:30] way because I've been with the Egyptians
[48:33] all these
[48:34] years this is what I know this is the my
[48:37] way of living I can't expect it to come
[48:40] this way no but then he said like you
[48:42] know bring it willingly right and I will
[48:45] use it and out of when the children of
[48:47] Israel came out in Exodus 35 then it
[48:51] takes among the people that came out and
[48:53] said that and Moses uh uh said unto the
[48:55] children of Israel see the Lord have
[48:58] called by
[48:59] name these are the people who were among
[49:03] the children of
[49:04] Israel he said you know I've called by
[49:06] name bezel the son of urri the son of UR
[49:09] and the tribe of of the tribe of Judah
[49:12] and he have filled him with the spirit
[49:14] of God in wisdom and in understanding
[49:19] and in knowledge in all manner of
[49:25] workmanship the Lord
[49:28] using people among
[49:31] us with all kind of wisdom and
[49:34] understanding to do a specific
[49:38] work the Bible says that they learned
[49:41] all these things from the
[49:44] Egyptians a child born in a certain
[49:46] environment will speak the language of
[49:48] that
[49:49] environment a child born of a certain in
[49:52] the forest will try to imitate the
[49:55] environment of the uh of the Jungle and
[49:57] these things right why because it's the
[50:01] environment regardless of that
[50:04] environment the Lord said like I'll use
[50:06] that in order to fulfill a purpose to
[50:11] fulfill the great work of the ministry
[50:14] and now this ministering Spirit are now
[50:17] been called Out Among the people to do
[50:21] the specific work to build a specific
[50:25] Tabernacle and as this tab Tabernacle
[50:28] are being built we are not to watch out
[50:32] on what kind of Tabernacle we are
[50:35] building right yeah because he said you
[50:38] have to do this according to the pattern
[50:41] I am calling Bez with wisdom
[50:44] understanding knowledge of workmanship
[50:47] to prepare the tools and the usil of the
[50:52] Tabernacle so it can you can be erected
[50:55] in the wilderness
[50:57] and here it is and and to devise curious
[51:00] work to work in gold and in silver in
[51:03] brass and in The Cutting of stone to set
[51:06] them and carving of hood to to make to
[51:10] make any manner of canning work and he
[51:13] have put in his
[51:15] heart that he may teach both he and OAB
[51:19] the son of AA a of the tribe of Dan them
[51:24] have he filled with wisdom of heart to
[51:26] work of all manner of work and to of the
[51:30] engraver and of the cunning Workman and
[51:33] of the embroider in blue and in purple
[51:35] in scarlet and and and and in fine linen
[51:39] and of the the river even to do even
[51:43] even them of do any work of those that
[51:46] device canning
[51:49] work I'm showing the Ministries that the
[51:53] Lord is bringing in the among the people
[51:56] to do a specific work but I'm not
[51:58] talking about the physical
[52:01] Tabernacle I'm talking about the
[52:03] Tabernacle of God because he said like
[52:06] you know what house will thou build me
[52:08] because the Lord does not dwell in
[52:11] buildings made out of hands of
[52:15] men therefore we are not to look at this
[52:18] physical building we appreciate the
[52:20] environment that we are able to have to
[52:22] we call the house of the Lord but that's
[52:25] not the place that the Lord wants to
[52:29] dwell because he has a specific place
[52:33] and now in these specific places that he
[52:36] has people around that
[52:40] Tabernacle using the background of those
[52:44] Tabernacle in order to fulfill God's
[52:48] program in other words that the prophet
[52:50] came to us with this great and wonderful
[52:54] message taken from the the presence of
[52:57] God seals being revealed being made
[53:00] manifest unto us in this last day
[53:02] different from all the
[53:05] organizations blew us our mind the
[53:09] things that didn't cross our mind or our
[53:11] heart and we never thought of uh the D
[53:14] of Jesus Christ the way we know it today
[53:17] that's right we didn't know about the SP
[53:20] uh serpent SE the way we know it
[53:24] today and yet now the prophet is come
[53:26] and
[53:28] gone but the work must continue amen and
[53:32] he tells him that I have called belil
[53:35] from this tribe I've called OAB of this
[53:38] tribe for them to take all these
[53:42] pieces and build the Lord's a tabernacle
[53:46] amen praise the Lord these Ministries
[53:49] are coming around about us in order to
[53:53] fulfill a specific work right and and as
[53:57] these Ministries are coming around us we
[54:00] are to be
[54:02] careful where are these Ministries
[54:04] leading us
[54:06] amen into what image are they shaping
[54:10] us we saw last year that Martin Luther
[54:14] a minister of the
[54:16] Gospel took the people right into
[54:21] communism and here the Lord says what
[54:24] house will thou build me
[54:27] men yeah is it after the F manner of the
[54:31] world or is it according to what Moses
[54:34] is brought down and fulfilled to be made
[54:38] manifest and this fulfillment is not
[54:41] just a spiritual fulfillment but it is a
[54:44] physical also
[54:49] fulfillment that's right because the
[54:52] Fulfillment the final evidence is the
[54:55] change of the
[54:57] body and this change of the body is the
[55:01] process of all these ministers building
[55:05] step by step step by step until the full
[55:08] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[55:10] of
[55:12] God and he said that you know I'm
[55:15] bringing I'm calling these
[55:17] ministers and we all know each one of us
[55:20] as a ministry right and these Ministries
[55:23] as they are being set around us musician
[55:26] i s and deacons song leaders and helpers
[55:30] and seen and
[55:32] unseen they are doing a specific
[55:35] work but then we are to be now very
[55:38] careful what kind of ministry is being
[55:41] introdu into
[55:44] us because the prophet says that you
[55:46] know be careful don't be
[55:49] clannish he said but watch out the devil
[55:52] bring somebody among you it's a Ministry
[55:57] it's somebody with the
[55:59] word because a Ministry is the angel of
[56:02] Light am it's somebody well
[56:05] spoken somebody that can stand and uh
[56:08] say the whole part of the word and and
[56:11] just leave out a section of the word and
[56:13] it destroyed the whole
[56:16] pattern just as the devil went into the
[56:19] Garden of Eden and told her 99% of the
[56:23] truth it was a Ministry
[56:26] but he didn't build the whole Tabernacle
[56:29] according to the pattern amen because if
[56:32] it's not according to the pattern then
[56:34] we are just
[56:36] building an altar onto
[56:41] Malik and if we are building an altar
[56:44] onto Malo then we have to sacrifice our
[56:48] children unto
[56:50] malok but if we building the Tabernacle
[56:53] unto the Lord then we have to take our
[56:56] lamb and sacrifice it on the
[56:58] altar sir and this sacrificing lamb was
[57:03] has to be a perfect one and if he a
[57:06] perfect one it requires that the parent
[57:08] to be fulfilled
[57:11] accordingly sir you're going to see
[57:15] something more
[57:16] here now
[57:18] watch this
[57:21] Ministries are all set in the body
[57:26] but each one of them
[57:29] notice has their limitations
[57:33] right each Ministry you can watch around
[57:37] regardless of how many ministers you can
[57:39] listen to every time that you listen to
[57:42] one being filled with the spirit of God
[57:45] you'll see something different from the
[57:46] next
[57:47] one you'll see a different touch from
[57:50] the next one the more ministers you are
[57:54] listening the more
[57:59] wonderful it is to say like Lord you
[58:01] have given me the
[58:03] privilege to be built by all these
[58:07] ministers then the limitation of these
[58:11] ministers some of us will not remain in
[58:16] our God's given
[58:20] position we like to go beyond our
[58:23] god-given privilege
[58:27] the electricity in the
[58:30] house when it comes into the light it is
[58:33] the same uh electricity but it produces
[58:37] a different work of the ministry right
[58:41] the electricity in the keyboards and
[58:43] stuff it brings a whole different
[58:47] Ministry but then at times the keyboard
[58:50] wants to be the
[58:54] light I am the one being noticed by all
[58:57] at once oh they hiding me behind there I
[59:00] should be the one up
[59:03] there and we don't like to behave our
[59:07] positions and the Lord said like you
[59:09] know but the way I have called you is to
[59:13] have you specifically yes sir in that
[59:17] position for you to fulfill God's
[59:20] program amen but they didn't like it in
[59:23] numbers uh numbers three is the end the
[59:26] Lord spoke unto Moses saying bring the
[59:28] tribe of the of of Levi near all the
[59:31] ministers and present them before Aaron
[59:33] the priest that they may Minister unto
[59:36] him and they shall keep his charge and
[59:39] the charge of the whole congregation
[59:41] before the Tabernacle of the
[59:43] congregation and to do the service of
[59:47] the
[59:48] Tabernacle the ministry is being
[59:52] brought according to the voice of
[59:56] Malachi
[59:58] 4 that's why we don't believe in women
[1:00:01] preachers because Malachi 4 told us that
[1:00:04] that's not the
[1:00:08] place
[1:00:10] am but then they don't like
[1:00:15] that with the world system she can she's
[1:00:19] eloquent oh yeah she can do it better
[1:00:22] than any other
[1:00:24] man but the Lord said I have chosen Levi
[1:00:29] among the children of
[1:00:31] Israel and this children of Israel the
[1:00:35] purpose is
[1:00:37] specific each one of us have a certain
[1:00:40] position to
[1:00:42] play but then our god-given privilege
[1:00:46] had to be very cautious before our eyes
[1:00:50] amen and when we look at the Tabernacle
[1:00:53] that has to be built
[1:00:56] the Tabernacle I said was made out of
[1:00:58] three
[1:01:01] parts and all these three parts every
[1:01:04] single
[1:01:05] Ministry God has equipped them or given
[1:01:09] them the privilege that when they
[1:01:13] understand that if they do only what God
[1:01:18] has given them to
[1:01:20] do the ministry will be so successful
[1:01:26] but then success nowadays is not defined
[1:01:29] according to the pattern it's defined
[1:01:32] according to the world
[1:01:36] Amen I'm talking the ministry of the
[1:01:41] sanctuary what house will you build
[1:01:45] me brother whatam say I'll skip here
[1:01:47] just to take uh in leadership but says
[1:01:54] now he's showing us all the Ministries
[1:01:57] then I will go back to the Bible again
[1:01:59] now mama has taught you to
[1:02:06] walk a child is
[1:02:08] born the 16 elements was put together
[1:02:12] but you said now mama has taught you how
[1:02:14] to
[1:02:15] walk but in this modern world Mama
[1:02:19] doesn't want to teach them
[1:02:21] anymore no no no no no I have to take
[1:02:24] Dad's place
[1:02:26] yeah no no no no no I have to be on the
[1:02:30] street you read the message you can see
[1:02:33] all the quotations speaks about look at
[1:02:35] what is the greatest disgrace of the
[1:02:38] country look at how the devil is taken a
[1:02:41] woman out of his place why because the
[1:02:44] ministry didn't want to stay in its
[1:02:49] place yeah what house will thou build
[1:02:53] me because if you you are not in your
[1:02:57] position how will you do the work of the
[1:03:01] Lord because the children of Israel down
[1:03:04] there in Babylon they said how shall we
[1:03:06] sing the songs of Zion here in
[1:03:11] Babylon the work of the ministry the
[1:03:14] ministry of the sanctuary that the Lord
[1:03:18] is looking to proed and to dwell among
[1:03:21] the people the Lord said mama has to
[1:03:25] take the child first the first teacher
[1:03:28] the first Minister The Fifth Gospel amen
[1:03:32] she has to take hold of him or her the
[1:03:35] child in order to make the first
[1:03:40] stage Papa has taught you how to be uh
[1:03:44] to be brilliant and and and and a nice
[1:03:46] young man and how to take care of
[1:03:49] yourself and behave
[1:03:53] yourself mama has taught you how to
[1:03:56] communicate that is coming now to deal
[1:03:59] with you now in the spirit
[1:04:03] level mama is dealing with
[1:04:06] us hey come here I'll wash you come here
[1:04:09] eat all the physical element momy's
[1:04:11] teaching mommy's teaching mommy's
[1:04:13] teaching then that takes
[1:04:16] over just as we come in the
[1:04:19] church we come we listen to the word in
[1:04:22] the outer
[1:04:23] Court oh the environment looks it's good
[1:04:26] I like the music oh I like what these
[1:04:28] people preaching I think it's good it
[1:04:31] just got to your mind
[1:04:33] amen physically you hear oh you see
[1:04:36] everybody wearing skirts and they say oh
[1:04:39] I don't have much skirts let me go get
[1:04:42] another
[1:04:44] skirt you being influenced by those
[1:04:49] Ministries and now if a Ministry is
[1:04:52] now not willing to stay in it
[1:04:56] position like I'll dress
[1:04:59] anyhow I'll cut my
[1:05:02] hair I'll do all kind of things you
[1:05:07] understand that God's vision is being
[1:05:12] sabotaged is being looked
[1:05:17] over when he can stay in his position in
[1:05:20] his
[1:05:23] responsibility but what I'm says that
[1:05:25] every is the priest of his home right
[1:05:29] he's the one leading the
[1:05:31] way and now if the father can stay in
[1:05:34] his position what house will you build
[1:05:38] me very
[1:05:42] good the teacher has taught you in
[1:05:45] education how to pronounce word the
[1:05:48] phonetics and the language structure
[1:05:52] public speaking when you stand in front
[1:05:54] of people you stand this way you learn
[1:05:56] all these
[1:05:57] things we all went to
[1:06:03] school but some of us didn't like school
[1:06:08] either how to read and write but now you
[1:06:12] are living Papa you are living mama and
[1:06:16] you are leaving the teacher now somebody
[1:06:19] has to take you from here
[1:06:23] on all these people follow these
[1:06:26] Ministries are
[1:06:28] working uh consecutively or one after
[1:06:32] the other in order to lead you
[1:06:38] somewhere because if they are not doing
[1:06:40] exactly what they supposed to do you see
[1:06:43] the child coming said the child can't
[1:06:46] read the child can talk and the child
[1:06:48] can keep a communic a a uh a sentence
[1:06:51] and doesn't know how to present himself
[1:06:55] and disrespectful to everyone that
[1:06:58] doesn't know how
[1:06:59] to shake hands and greet people around
[1:07:02] the the world and things then you know
[1:07:05] that a Ministry has fell
[1:07:10] somewhere remember the Lord has said
[1:07:14] that he has given them
[1:07:16] privilege from the Egyptians to have
[1:07:19] silver and gold and brass and all these
[1:07:22] things and they are bringing it
[1:07:24] willingly onto to the
[1:07:29] Lord I am going very slowly so that it's
[1:07:33] not
[1:07:34] confusing of
[1:07:36] how why the physic these physical
[1:07:39] element are important in God's
[1:07:42] Kingdom so that the holy place is
[1:07:46] important in God's kingdom and even the
[1:07:50] holy of holies is important in God's
[1:07:53] kingdom amen because he wants to dwell
[1:07:57] among the people and by wanting to dwell
[1:08:00] among the people he calls all these
[1:08:03] people in different stages with
[1:08:05] different type of work for them to
[1:08:09] fulfill and when us the briad of Jesus
[1:08:12] Christ we look around and we understand
[1:08:14] our god-given privilege of what we can
[1:08:17] bring forward it's not something that
[1:08:20] you know as myself I'm not a
[1:08:22] singer I can sing
[1:08:26] I've tried it never
[1:08:29] worked but then if I start talking I can
[1:08:34] stop I can force it why because it's
[1:08:37] God's given gifts according to his own
[1:08:43] desire to place Us in the Kingdom
[1:08:47] calling us onto the ministry for a
[1:08:49] specific purpose thank you Lord I can
[1:08:53] choose all my life to try to become a
[1:08:56] musician but brother Ram says like you
[1:08:59] know yes you know if it's not God's
[1:09:01] given element you know it's just a
[1:09:03] struggle left and right but you see them
[1:09:05] even a child that is born without even
[1:09:08] taking a a music class will just set in
[1:09:10] front of those kids and startop playing
[1:09:12] them why God's given
[1:09:16] privilege God has anointed them with
[1:09:20] wisdom and understanding
[1:09:28] what house will you build me the
[1:09:31] ministry of the sanctuary let's go back
[1:09:34] to the
[1:09:36] Bible and
[1:09:38] now as the Tabernacle is being set I'm
[1:09:41] taking the Shadow the type of uh uh of
[1:09:44] the Tabernacle here in the
[1:09:46] wilderness so we can see another layer
[1:09:49] the limitations of the Ministries around
[1:09:51] the Tabernacle that the Lord wants is
[1:09:53] wanting to build
[1:09:57] and the Lord spake unto Moses uh numbers
[1:10:02] 3:23 around the Tabernacle says that you
[1:10:05] know the families of the gites shall
[1:10:07] peit behind the Tabernacle Westward
[1:10:10] watch what the Lord is doing and the and
[1:10:13] and the Church of the sons of gersan in
[1:10:16] the tab in the Tabernacle of the
[1:10:18] congregation shall be the Tabernacle and
[1:10:20] the tent the covering thereof and the
[1:10:22] hanging of the door of the Tabernacle
[1:10:24] and the Cong conation of the
[1:10:26] congregation and the hangings of the
[1:10:28] court and the curtains of the door the
[1:10:31] door of the Court which is by the
[1:10:32] Tabernacle and by the and by the altar
[1:10:35] round about and the cords of it of all
[1:10:38] the service thereof the Lord is
[1:10:42] defining the ministry
[1:10:46] amen just as I'm standing here it say
[1:10:49] like you know on the back there we have
[1:10:52] all these ministers back there or take
[1:10:54] the person that is next to you behind
[1:10:57] you there somebody is bringing an
[1:11:01] atmosphere right he bringing a
[1:11:04] Ministry if the person behind you is
[1:11:06] joyful you get carried by the spirit
[1:11:09] too if the person behind you is
[1:11:13] slumbering and out of focus and in
[1:11:16] having all kind and before you know it
[1:11:20] it's on you butam says like you know in
[1:11:23] the prayer line he say like you know
[1:11:25] watch out the spirit is calling help
[1:11:28] from one another in order to bring more
[1:11:31] unbelief among the people why because
[1:11:34] the devil has the pardon of what God has
[1:11:38] and is duplicating it in all our
[1:11:43] services the type of wife that you are
[1:11:45] choosing to marry is bringing an
[1:11:48] atmosphere around
[1:11:52] you this this was on the the Gite will
[1:11:56] be behind on the west side and um
[1:11:59] numbers 3:29 the families of the son of
[1:12:01] Kath shall pitch on the side of the
[1:12:04] Tabernacle Southward this is the South
[1:12:07] and the chch shall be the Ark of and the
[1:12:10] and and the table and the Candlestick
[1:12:12] and the altars and and the vessel of the
[1:12:15] sanctuary wherewith the minister and the
[1:12:18] hanging and the all the service
[1:12:23] thereof merari on the
[1:12:26] North 3:36 and under the custody of the
[1:12:30] sons of marari shall be the boats of the
[1:12:33] Tabernacles and the bars thereof and the
[1:12:36] pillars thereof and the sock door
[1:12:38] thereof and all the vessels thereof and
[1:12:41] all the the servers that there to and
[1:12:44] the pillars of the CT roundabout and the
[1:12:48] sockets and their pins and their codes
[1:12:51] the Lord is splitting the work amen
[1:12:54] don't try to be the next fellow's
[1:12:58] job don't try to preach like the next
[1:13:02] one don't try to come on the pulpit when
[1:13:04] you can just be on the pews and be
[1:13:06] praying William Brenham shows said you
[1:13:09] want to see the reason these meetings
[1:13:11] are having a success it opens the door
[1:13:14] and man is
[1:13:16] praying he say at this time my wife is
[1:13:18] out there praying for me y when he's
[1:13:22] going to work somebody's working is
[1:13:24] praying for him
[1:13:26] he doesn't even know that somebody's
[1:13:29] praying for him he doesn't even know why
[1:13:32] he's getting all the success in his
[1:13:34] business because there is a Ministry
[1:13:37] sitting in his position doing exactly
[1:13:40] what is supposed to do praise the Lord
[1:13:44] but then when there's no such a thing
[1:13:45] around us what house are we
[1:13:49] building and we'll see the consequences
[1:13:53] of building the AR according to the
[1:13:57] Tabernacle and according to how the
[1:13:59] prophet saw that
[1:14:01] Tabernacle and how the mind of that
[1:14:04] Tabernacle shall be how the soul of that
[1:14:06] Tabernacle shall be what kind of
[1:14:08] Revelation is supposed to be but here we
[1:14:11] just laying it around that we see that
[1:14:14] around us we are to be very
[1:14:18] careful we can say like you know we've
[1:14:20] come to Jesus we worshiping in The
[1:14:24] Message Church
[1:14:25] but that Ministry that environment can
[1:14:29] be very
[1:14:32] deceptive we prove it according to the
[1:14:34] word according to the prophet he said
[1:14:36] like you know many times the churches
[1:14:38] has become businesses
[1:14:41] amen they have a different agenda than
[1:14:44] God's
[1:14:45] program that's why it say like you know
[1:14:47] then when a church becomes focused in
[1:14:50] the in the uh uh in money they say that
[1:14:53] church is done
[1:14:55] there's no way
[1:14:58] back and when you get in that type of
[1:15:00] church then you start to see the type of
[1:15:03] focus people have right right the mind
[1:15:07] is turned around how deceptive they can
[1:15:13] be how negligent they can be Accord with
[1:15:16] the
[1:15:17] word such a place that we are standing
[1:15:22] conscious and the Lord said
[1:15:25] uh Leviticus 12 and the Lord spake unto
[1:15:28] Moses saying Speak unto the children of
[1:15:30] Israel saying if um sorry I wanted first
[1:15:35] numbers 3 uh 38 but uh those that encom
[1:15:41] before the Tabernacle toward the East
[1:15:43] even before the Tabernacle of the
[1:15:45] congregation east east word shall be
[1:15:48] Moses and Aaron and his sons keeping the
[1:15:52] charge of the sanctu for the the charge
[1:15:55] of the children of Israel and the
[1:15:57] stranger that cometh night shall be put
[1:16:01] to
[1:16:04] death if the person is not recognized
[1:16:08] among the
[1:16:10] Ministries and try to get close to the
[1:16:14] Tabernacle it is death
[1:16:18] amen that's why I say like you know it
[1:16:20] is a great
[1:16:22] responsibility to stand up here amen am
[1:16:25] I giving God's word or am I giving my
[1:16:29] mind am I giving my interpretation of
[1:16:31] the word or am I giving God's word right
[1:16:35] is it according to the
[1:16:38] pardon yeah because William Brenham went
[1:16:40] to
[1:16:42] hell and you saw all kind of
[1:16:45] Tabernacles and one day he stand and
[1:16:47] looks and said oh my God those Spirits
[1:16:49] are
[1:16:50] here those Ministries are being made
[1:16:52] manifest
[1:16:55] but then the Lord said do not worry
[1:16:57] there's another one coming back around
[1:16:59] again hallelujah how all of us we have
[1:17:03] come from
[1:17:04] Babylon we have come from all these kind
[1:17:07] of backgrounds but then the Ministries
[1:17:10] that I'm pointing to that we are to be
[1:17:13] very
[1:17:15] cautious that it is according to the
[1:17:18] pattern amen that's why is showing that
[1:17:22] the Tabernacle laying standing there
[1:17:25] he puts Moses and his Aaron and the sons
[1:17:29] of Aaron on the east side and it puts
[1:17:33] all other tribes on the three other
[1:17:36] sides and all of them or on the four
[1:17:39] sides and all of them the form they
[1:17:42] Gathering the
[1:17:44] throne and as they are gathering the
[1:17:47] throne they are
[1:17:49] respectively bringing an anointing as it
[1:17:52] is in Revelation 5 that on the throne
[1:17:56] was surrounded by the four living
[1:17:58] beasts one of them a lion one of them uh
[1:18:03] the ox one of them uh the men one of
[1:18:06] them the eagle as they are sitting
[1:18:08] around was to God the Tabernacle so that
[1:18:12] everywhere that the Tabernacle goes so
[1:18:16] that those Spirits goes with
[1:18:18] them as we are seated in the
[1:18:21] church surround yourself
[1:18:25] with people who are
[1:18:29] anointed because the more they are
[1:18:31] anointed the more you are ready to fly
[1:18:35] because Ezekiel Saw the throne coming
[1:18:38] down he was always surrounded by all
[1:18:41] these four living beings and as they
[1:18:44] were surrounded by these four living
[1:18:46] beings they were ready to fulfill God's
[1:18:49] program at all time but then when God's
[1:18:52] program is not according
[1:18:56] to what God has shows the shown the
[1:18:58] prophet we are unable to get
[1:19:01] anywhere we can fool ourself and say
[1:19:04] like you know in the message we are I
[1:19:06] believe the message and all this this is
[1:19:08] Brother this is what I believe that's
[1:19:10] why I said like you know last time you
[1:19:12] better understand what what type of
[1:19:15] choice that you make out of the
[1:19:18] lamps part of the doctrine here portion
[1:19:21] of the doctrine here but then when you
[1:19:23] sit with the part of the Prophet you
[1:19:26] listen to him you look at him from 47
[1:19:30] all the way up then you start
[1:19:33] understanding
[1:19:36] wow I thought I was a
[1:19:39] Christian I thought was just going to
[1:19:42] church I thought it was just like you
[1:19:44] know hearing A good sermon and paying
[1:19:46] the tight all these stages out quot holy
[1:19:50] place and most holy have the specific
[1:19:53] things and these Ministries each one of
[1:19:57] them have the
[1:19:58] limitation you can see an evangelist can
[1:20:03] only take you so far amen it's not that
[1:20:06] he's not an it's not he not a minister
[1:20:09] but that's what God's given
[1:20:12] him but then it requires all these four
[1:20:15] living beings in order to make the
[1:20:18] complete program come to pass because he
[1:20:22] said I the Lord has given them
[1:20:26] unto some he has given unto some he has
[1:20:29] given unto some he has given right but
[1:20:33] then when a minister start calling
[1:20:35] himself a hole in
[1:20:37] hole he can preach it
[1:20:40] all he can know it
[1:20:42] all watch
[1:20:47] out because the Lord wants to dwell
[1:20:51] among us and this Tabernacle that we are
[1:20:54] speaking about about is we are talking
[1:20:56] about
[1:20:57] us our
[1:20:59] body our mind our
[1:21:03] soul the Lord said he that defiles his
[1:21:07] body the Lord shall destroy
[1:21:10] right amen yet a minister will tell you
[1:21:13] like you know yeah the body is not
[1:21:15] really that
[1:21:19] important say if you don't take care of
[1:21:21] your teeth they'll pull it out
[1:21:28] it is God's
[1:21:33] Tabernacle if you come to church without
[1:21:35] excuse me
[1:21:38] but then you'll make everybody else
[1:21:45] uncomfortable if you come to church with
[1:21:47] your mind all crowded by workload and
[1:21:50] left and right and your mind is not
[1:21:52] focused then quickly you start spreading
[1:21:55] it
[1:21:56] around and if some of us are weak and
[1:21:59] cannot hold hold up the faith and
[1:22:01] quickly start affecting everybody else
[1:22:04] did you see what the pastor preach and
[1:22:05] you know I don't really believe that you
[1:22:07] know according to what I know you know
[1:22:09] all this now you start bringing all kind
[1:22:11] of mind botles in the church before you
[1:22:14] know it what is that all kind of
[1:22:17] Ministries that we are bringing around
[1:22:20] us that we allowing as I believe brother
[1:22:22] Ron usually said so like you know you
[1:22:24] and you go you listen left and right and
[1:22:26] you end up you know with
[1:22:28] all questions and that you can't even
[1:22:31] answer and yourself you can't find a way
[1:22:34] because you didn't follow God's program
[1:22:36] that's
[1:22:37] right he said do it according to the
[1:22:41] p and some of these ministers they will
[1:22:45] come to a point because they were not
[1:22:47] God orain man just as brother bam speaks
[1:22:50] of balam he said like you know hey look
[1:22:53] at what he does
[1:22:55] he calls he wanted to strengthen his uh
[1:22:58] uh uh to strengthen his uh his uh uh
[1:23:02] personality in front of the people he
[1:23:04] can he went and joined himself and and
[1:23:06] started showing how to get to God's
[1:23:08] children and Destroy them and weaken
[1:23:10] them and all these
[1:23:12] things so it is that we are saying
[1:23:15] today ministers all over theam this
[1:23:18] andam that and all these things here
[1:23:21] what are we doing we allowing these
[1:23:23] Ministries to get into our mind amen and
[1:23:27] once they get to our mind quickly they
[1:23:30] find their way into the
[1:23:32] soul let me prove it in the word quickly
[1:23:35] and then we shall
[1:23:41] finish Leviticus 10 1-3 and nadab and ab
[1:23:46] the son of Sons of Aaron the word the
[1:23:50] Bible is recognizing them as being
[1:23:53] ministers right
[1:23:56] they were positionally placed there to
[1:23:59] minister to the
[1:24:01] Tabernacle but look at what they're
[1:24:03] doing and took either of them his sensor
[1:24:08] and put fire therein and put incense
[1:24:11] there on and offered Strange Fire before
[1:24:15] the
[1:24:18] Lord when we come to the
[1:24:20] pulpit we can can we can have the idea
[1:24:24] to impress the
[1:24:25] church I'll preach a sermon that will be
[1:24:28] outstanding nobody has preached like
[1:24:30] this
[1:24:31] before Strange
[1:24:35] Fire and this is the result he said like
[1:24:38] you know which he has not uh Str before
[1:24:41] the Lord which he commanded them
[1:24:44] commanded them not and they went out
[1:24:48] went out fire from the Lord and devoured
[1:24:51] them and they died before the Lord then
[1:24:53] Moses said to Aaron this is that the
[1:24:56] Lord spake saying I will be Sanctified
[1:24:59] in them to that come n on me night me
[1:25:03] and before all the people I will be
[1:25:05] glorified and Aaron held his peace
[1:25:09] amen I can say like you know that
[1:25:11] brother bite like you know that he's not
[1:25:13] a minister no he's God's given
[1:25:18] Ministry but they were just
[1:25:22] overcame but what God has given in
[1:25:25] them they went a little bit
[1:25:28] farther the mother just went a little
[1:25:31] bit to become a little bit
[1:25:34] masculine Minister wanted to have a
[1:25:37] higher speech but I'm saying like you
[1:25:40] know they would even use voices that
[1:25:43] that they would the the the the Pastoral
[1:25:46] voices they wouldn't speak like that
[1:25:48] normally but then when they come around
[1:25:50] sister you know according to what God
[1:25:52] has given me we have the greatest
[1:25:55] Revelation
[1:25:56] here I'm
[1:26:01] quoting they just want a little bit
[1:26:03] farther then each one of us in our
[1:26:07] ministry mother father teacher whoever
[1:26:12] we are it has to be according to the PN
[1:26:15] and to the level of access that God has
[1:26:17] given us sir because God is said to the
[1:26:22] woman that she can only be saved by
[1:26:25] being a mother and doing what
[1:26:28] continuing in the
[1:26:34] faith but then when she doesn't
[1:26:37] believe she say no no no no no no now I
[1:26:41] can just like you know be a free woman
[1:26:44] freedom freedom is that what you call
[1:26:51] Freedom and when you die you don't see
[1:26:54] that should
[1:26:57] dying because when America turned from
[1:27:00] God look at
[1:27:02] America you'll be foolish to stand up
[1:27:05] there and say like you know America
[1:27:08] is what are you talking about this the
[1:27:10] greatest
[1:27:12] nation we have the better Road systems
[1:27:15] in the
[1:27:15] world we have the best diplomacy in the
[1:27:20] world but it didn't look like it
[1:27:24] God took the kingdom away from Saul it
[1:27:27] didn't look like
[1:27:31] it the man kept doing what he supposed
[1:27:34] to
[1:27:35] do we kept preaching like we usually do
[1:27:38] but we already
[1:27:44] dead now I'm calling us to be aware of
[1:27:48] the type of Ministries that we are
[1:27:50] looking at that we are setting ourself
[1:27:52] onto amen all this goes to the father
[1:27:56] mothers preachers in the church and
[1:27:58] everywhere in the workplace and all
[1:28:00] these places that we putting ourself
[1:28:03] into because those at places they have
[1:28:07] atmospheres those music have
[1:28:11] atmospheres as I preach it last last
[1:28:14] time last year I Believe by God's grace
[1:28:16] regarding music and all these
[1:28:19] things you look at them they just like
[1:28:21] you know innocent people they look good
[1:28:23] they write good words and good Melodies
[1:28:26] and all these
[1:28:28] things but then how come the prophet a
[1:28:31] man who was
[1:28:32] singing uh uh NIS Presley and all this
[1:28:36] good music when you listen to it
[1:28:39] naturally and you say like you know it's
[1:28:41] evil
[1:28:45] inspired Al
[1:28:47] Presley with all
[1:28:50] that the rhythm of el Presley compared
[1:28:54] to what the churches have
[1:28:57] today who has went farther then Elvis
[1:29:00] Presley or
[1:29:03] us I'm showing us the ministry of the
[1:29:07] sanctuary because the Lord said I'll be
[1:29:11] Sanctified and glorified among the
[1:29:14] people
[1:29:16] amen yes let's be
[1:29:20] aware of what we are doing with this
[1:29:23] amen
[1:29:24] of what we are doing with this and what
[1:29:27] we are doing with
[1:29:29] this all these three codes because when
[1:29:33] nadab and Hab went they didn't go into
[1:29:36] the holy of holies but they went into
[1:29:39] the holy place to offer sensor they
[1:29:42] didn't go farther but they just went
[1:29:45] into the
[1:29:46] mind they just offered a Strange Fire
[1:29:50] into the
[1:29:51] mind oh sister you know you know know
[1:29:54] really it's not really that you know
[1:29:56] really actually also have a quotation
[1:29:58] here you can also have these things
[1:30:03] here like that do you know the
[1:30:07] consequences quickly death set
[1:30:11] in say like you know
[1:30:14] EAB in the
[1:30:16] church but it doesn't look like it but
[1:30:20] says he say he say look at this
[1:30:22] woman she was a Christian woman she
[1:30:26] stands there and she goes to church and
[1:30:28] and all of a sudden then she moved into
[1:30:30] a different
[1:30:32] neighborhood after moving in that
[1:30:34] neighborhood she start seeing how the
[1:30:36] girls and the women in that neighborhood
[1:30:38] that was dressing and they were going to
[1:30:41] bars and things then she say if they can
[1:30:44] do it why not me right oh if they can
[1:30:47] listen to that music Why Not
[1:30:50] Me butam said you see she started
[1:30:53] battling her mind mind after battling a
[1:30:55] mind but then her soul caught up with
[1:30:58] her on a death
[1:31:00] bed then she realize I am
[1:31:03] lost why the Ministries that we are
[1:31:07] surrounding ourself with amen the
[1:31:10] ministry of the sanctuary I am placing
[1:31:13] these things here so we can all be have
[1:31:17] the clear
[1:31:20] understanding that despite of who it is
[1:31:23] that you are Liv listening to you
[1:31:25] yourself must have the pattern amen you
[1:31:28] have access to the tapes and to the
[1:31:30] books because out of the same books and
[1:31:33] tapes any Minister can preach any type
[1:31:37] of sermon that he
[1:31:38] wants as long as he knows how to read
[1:31:41] and listen he will conceptualize
[1:31:43] anything of his of his own
[1:31:46] willing because of his
[1:31:49] lustfulness he will dress you the way
[1:31:52] you think they should be dressed
[1:31:55] maybe your weakness sister the way that
[1:31:57] you are dressing is influencing the
[1:32:00] younger ones around you in the faith
[1:32:03] without realizing
[1:32:06] true then we have to be very careful
[1:32:10] amen very cautious the example that we
[1:32:13] are setting before each one of
[1:32:17] us as I was when I was teaching the
[1:32:20] Sunday school back in Colorado
[1:32:24] one of the child came to me I say
[1:32:27] where's your notebook I said you know I
[1:32:31] don't have
[1:32:32] it I say I quickly cut the spirit I said
[1:32:36] like you know Hey listen you know in
[1:32:39] this environment we learn how to respect
[1:32:42] each
[1:32:43] other these are the basic
[1:32:46] things if you unable to just be
[1:32:48] respectful go to your mama let him let
[1:32:51] it let her teach you
[1:32:54] because that's leadership right taught
[1:32:57] us that Mama does that it's not
[1:33:02] us it's a simple thing look around after
[1:33:05] service you see somebody pass by you
[1:33:08] shake their hands God bless you brother
[1:33:10] God bless you s some of the basic
[1:33:12] things but then if that doesn't
[1:33:15] work how are you going to serve the
[1:33:19] Lord because that Ministry requires a
[1:33:22] whole different level
[1:33:24] of understanding right the lord requires
[1:33:28] that he has given us that element in our
[1:33:34] lives that Ministry that we may
[1:33:38] fulfill and when the child understood
[1:33:41] that I said like you know brother I'm
[1:33:43] sorry I said like you know we are
[1:33:45] brothers amen that's why we here to help
[1:33:48] each other at times he can be very basic
[1:33:51] and very cutting in some places but it
[1:33:54] is very important
[1:33:56] amen that parents that we are leaders
[1:34:01] that we are in all our level of
[1:34:05] responsibilities understand what house
[1:34:07] are we building
[1:34:09] him I can go on and on showing brother
[1:34:13] bam say like you know he say in U
[1:34:16] unwelcome unwelcome Christ he say like
[1:34:18] you know look how the when the uh The
[1:34:22] Prostitute went to buy the the the to
[1:34:25] buy the the the the perfume he say like
[1:34:27] instead of the man standing there as a
[1:34:30] gentleman to say like how can I help you
[1:34:33] it's say what do you
[1:34:35] want at times you see that among the
[1:34:38] people these are things of the outer
[1:34:42] Court these are things that have to be
[1:34:46] learned to be
[1:34:48] gracious these are things to be held in
[1:34:51] the mind so that when the Lord does when
[1:34:54] we see brother I was listening that to
[1:34:56] the prophet the other day he comes and
[1:34:59] the woman walks on the pulpit but he
[1:35:02] couldn't say what the woman was going
[1:35:04] through on the mic he puts the mic on
[1:35:06] the side and they even blur what was
[1:35:08] said on the on the on the tape I said
[1:35:11] like you know you see you know I
[1:35:12] couldn't say that to the
[1:35:14] public what does
[1:35:16] that work of the ministry that's right
[1:35:20] respectful of the people that you are
[1:35:22] dealing with
[1:35:24] the atmosphere that you are creating and
[1:35:27] the type of Tabernacle that we are
[1:35:29] building because as by God's grace that
[1:35:33] we are seeing all these four corners
[1:35:36] being surrounded by this anointing and
[1:35:39] these anointing will influence
[1:35:41] everything that will go into the holy of
[1:35:43] holies because remember Aaron will go
[1:35:45] into the holy of holies once a
[1:35:49] year the sons of Aaron will go into the
[1:35:52] holy place to offer
[1:35:55] Ence and the sons of the levite the rest
[1:35:58] of them will take care of the outer
[1:36:01] courts this Tabernacle as the Lord is
[1:36:04] building it he said I will be
[1:36:08] Sanctified and be
[1:36:11] glorified among the people amen it's not
[1:36:14] a choice the choice was given when the
[1:36:18] people had chosen to choose that lamp
[1:36:21] and that lamp to become what
[1:36:24] cover them in order to go and build the
[1:36:28] temple without the shedding of blood
[1:36:30] there's no remission of sin amen and if
[1:36:33] the blood is not shed then what are we
[1:36:36] dealing with human
[1:36:39] reasoning the Egyptian mindset you
[1:36:42] reading the same Bible Shalom didn't
[1:36:45] understand that she brought with him his
[1:36:48] son that he had that she had with an
[1:36:51] Egyptian and when the child came came
[1:36:53] into the camp of Israel there was
[1:36:55] certain manners to behave then she
[1:36:58] looked and say she start he started
[1:37:01] cursing then the Lord said bring him
[1:37:04] before Moses he come before Moses say
[1:37:06] Lord what do you want us to do he say
[1:37:08] Stone
[1:37:10] him all these things are laid down in
[1:37:13] the word specifically regardless of the
[1:37:17] background where we come
[1:37:19] from sorry he
[1:37:22] hased that he wants his church to reach
[1:37:25] Amen on the outer Court in the holy of
[1:37:29] hly in the most holy uh in the Holy
[1:37:32] place and the holy holy of holies all
[1:37:35] these three stages you can say like you
[1:37:38] know I I want pay much attention to the
[1:37:40] out of place outter court
[1:37:44] because it's it doesn't benefit me too
[1:37:50] much why are we dressing up
[1:37:54] why are we dressing the way we
[1:37:57] dress why do we think the way we
[1:38:00] think why do we believe what we
[1:38:03] believe all these places are very
[1:38:06] important to God's program amen he wants
[1:38:10] that building that house that Tabernacle
[1:38:14] that Sanctuary to be built but he's
[1:38:16] putting us round about each other amen
[1:38:20] where's your brother it might my
[1:38:22] brother's keep
[1:38:24] you are amen you are the
[1:38:30] ministry that's the more I'm standing
[1:38:33] here the more is giving me but I have to
[1:38:37] stop and that's the beauty of the
[1:38:41] word I didn't read all the
[1:38:45] quotes at times this is the hard place
[1:38:48] with the
[1:38:49] ministry it tells you take only one
[1:38:52] portion but you want a whole section of
[1:38:54] it and you come here none of it is being
[1:38:59] used but I believe that you getting what
[1:39:02] God wants us to dwell thank you Lord
[1:39:05] what he wants us to
[1:39:07] do if we are confused about the ministry
[1:39:10] that we have to do let's go back to the
[1:39:12] pattern open the book listen to the
[1:39:15] tapes let's know exactly what it is and
[1:39:19] let the Revelation come in let the
[1:39:21] Revelation flow because without
[1:39:24] Revelation it is impossible to please
[1:39:27] God we are not here just making
[1:39:30] backgrounds like you know I'm African
[1:39:32] left and right I showed this about I
[1:39:35] believe two years back on Nim road we
[1:39:37] had the result of that every one of
[1:39:40] us different backgrounds and uh they
[1:39:43] split us into white blacks and left and
[1:39:46] right up and down and all these things
[1:39:49] but then until the Revelation comes then
[1:39:51] you start looking all those things
[1:39:52] different
[1:39:54] amen said like hey we are God's
[1:39:58] Garden black white and brown yellow
[1:40:02] whatever you
[1:40:03] are bringing Beauty to the Lord when the
[1:40:08] Lord looks at us in unity of the spirit
[1:40:10] of the faith and one Lord one baptism
[1:40:13] One Faith he's dwelling Among Us in
[1:40:17] humility amen but then Nimrod looks at
[1:40:20] that pattern and he started using it
[1:40:22] otherwise
[1:40:24] I can talk to that one hey he's inferior
[1:40:26] I'm superior hey I think like you know
[1:40:28] I'm this then you know that's not the
[1:40:31] ministry of the sanctuary that we are
[1:40:33] talking about that's
[1:40:36] right amen shall we pray heavenly father
[1:40:40] has a musician come surely Lord
[1:40:44] uh in Simplicity Lord father God our
[1:40:47] word is so perfect and so precise
[1:40:51] Lord this fite Lord father God of all
[1:40:54] the work but you know exactly how to
[1:40:57] lead your children in Simplicity Lord
[1:41:01] what house shall you shall we build Lord
[1:41:04] father God unto you Lord the prophet
[1:41:06] took this father God so far so deep Lord
[1:41:09] father God in places Lord that you have
[1:41:12] revealed Lord but step by step Lord
[1:41:14] you're making it Lord father God
[1:41:16] revealed unto
[1:41:17] us let Lord father God this word sink
[1:41:21] into your children's Heart Lord
[1:41:24] because father God that's where father
[1:41:26] God the beding ground that's where the
[1:41:29] seed is planted that's where you come to
[1:41:32] meet
[1:41:34] men that's where God Moses being there
[1:41:38] on the mountain being filled father God
[1:41:41] there the Tabernacle by the SP by the
[1:41:43] presence of the Holy Ghost Lord he came
[1:41:45] down he veiled his
[1:41:47] face Lord father God but in this day you
[1:41:51] are the unveiled God yes you're being
[1:41:54] revealed Lord father God in your
[1:41:58] children that L father God a pill of
[1:42:00] fire the leak of fire as it was in the
[1:42:03] hoer room will come down and be father

[1:42:09] Lord whereby Lord you can be made
[1:42:11] manifest and put us exactly in our
[1:42:14] places so we can build you this

[1:42:28] Lord Lord anoint L father God the
[1:42:31] vessels around us to lead us Faithfully

[1:42:37] the peill of the cloud came into God the
[1:42:42] Tabernacle and it was consecrated unto
[1:42:44] the
[1:42:45] Lord father today may be the last
[1:42:49] sermon we can go to bed and never wake
