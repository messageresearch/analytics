this morning praise the lord we appreciate the Lord's presence we welcome you this morning in the name of the Lord and uh we're just so thankful that we can be here is that Xavier in the back there God bless you buddy it's good to see you yeah the Lord bless you all of our all of our visitors our locals we welcome you in the name of the Lord and um uh brother Ron sent me a text message there said that they're streaming the service and they're having a real lovely time there and uh sent some pictures of his his uh I'm getting a lot of feedback here um send a couple of pictures there of uh his balcony view where they're doing their devotions so I figured it was it was best not to show it up here on the screen because then everybody's going to be gone next week on vacation so and um so anyways we it's that time of year again where um kids are going back to school and I just asked brother Ron I said would you want me to have the kids come up front and we'll pray for them or just wait until next week and he said no go ahead and and do it this morning so all of you all of the kids teenagers even those of you who are going to college how about you come up here to the front and we're just going to dedicate you to the Lord here yeah there you go there's Zachary good job Zach come on everybody up here that's in school don't be shy oh my God huh let's just keep moving back yet tall ones in the back short ones up front with me gonna need a bigger stage from here says my goodness keep coming yes sir for the teachers as well sure yeah I think they need it also don't they yeah keep coming guys wow maybe we should have done half today and half next week praise the Lord that's the Next Generation that's rising up huh yeah sure wow how nice is this God bless you guys you know as you go to school you'll be partaking of the tree of knowledge of good and what of evil how many knows that there was another tree in the Garden of Eden at the same time what tree was that tree of life huh you knew it he knew it the tree of life and so we realize that as you're partaking of this tree of knowledge of good and of evil there's only one way to counterbalance this thing and that's to feed upon the tree of life and we know that the tree of life is who Jesus Christ and so the only way for you guys not to get balanced out of balance with school and influences and the things of the world is to partake of that tree of life which is Jesus Christ and that's what you're doing here this morning you're partaking of that tree reading your Bible praying and having a personal relationship with God is so important and so that's the kind of influence and let me encourage you guys it's so easy to be influenced by other people how about you be an influence to others around you and excuse me my back has turned to you all just as we're talking to the young people here you be an influence of Who You Are and of what God has done for you on other people so that they might see and get it you know what whatever you got I want it because you're different than everybody else and you guys are you're different and it's okay to be different so be encouraged choose your friends wisely the friends that you make in school try to make good friends people who are just like you in certain ways maybe they might not believe exactly how you believe but make sure and choose your friends wisely amen amen can you all agree that as we we're going to pray for the teachers here as well would you all raise your hands perhaps stand to your feet and say Lord we're in agreement here this morning for these young people and we dedicate them into your hands Lord that God would keep them that he would use them that they would get good grades and be good for their parents and do their homework I said that for my kids especially let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord we bring before you these young people father a great number of children of all ages Lord and your word says to bring the children Onto You Lord and so we're bringing them on to you father that you would protect them that you would watch over them that you would lead them and guide them Lord that you would prevent them Father from making wrong choices and making wrong friends father but God that you would be their portion father I pray that you would help them watch over them Lord and lead them and guide them Father as they go through this school year we ask father for the teachers also give them wisdom Lord these teachers in this age are are told to teach our kids things that we're not believing in Father we're just praying give the teachers wisdom father God that teach them what's right principles that are good Lord that'll that'll stay with these children for the rest of their days bless them Lord bless the parents and the families may you just keep us close and strong we ask it for thy Kingdom's glory in the name of Jesus Christ and the church said and the children said amen amen God bless you give them a round of applause here this morning God bless yourself okay you guys are good go ahead yeah praise the Lord and that's bigger than most churches so now you see the responsibility of the youth leaders yeah speaking of youth leaders the dubsky's there you know when the pastors away they're gone too they're up in Greer having a real nice time and brother Justin and brother John and brother yessa and Boaz and different ones there are also on vacation and they're streaming so we welcome them in the name of the Lord amen let's Stand Together turn with me in your Bibles to Proverbs chapter 8. we'll read verse 13 then we'll go to proverbs 13. verse 10. thank you musicians Proverbs chapter 8. and verse 13 it says the fear of the Lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the frow word mouth do I hate my Proverbs chapter 13. in verse 10 and it says only by Pride cometh contention so if there's contentions amongst us in our friendships and our families within our assembly what is the root cause of this contention Pride but with the whale advised is wisdom amen turn with me to Luke chapter 22. and we'll read verses 24 through 34. Luke chapter 22. and verse 20. 24 and it says and there was also a Strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest do you think there was pride in the life of the Apostles sure there was because there was contention and he said unto them the kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise Authority upon them are called benefactors but ye shall not be so but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is Chief as he that doth serve for whether is greater he that sitteth that meat or he that serveth is not he that sitteth at me but I am among you as he that service now he's trying to teach the disciples here he's saying yeah who is who is greater in the natural sure it's the one that's being served but I am serving you and we know that Jesus was our example so as he served us we are supposed to serve one another ye or they which have continued with me and my Temptations and I appoint unto you a kingdom as my father hath appointed unto me that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and the Lord said uh Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat I wonder was Simon one of the main ones that was being contentious I wonder what Simon the real one that the one of the ones that wanted to know uh is it me Lord am I the one that's going to be the greatest am I the one Lord because I've Stood Beside You All This Time because he turned and he he very it seems like he randomly said this to Simon he says Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fell not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren and he said unto him Lord I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death and he said I tell thee Peter the shall not Crow this day before that thou shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest me my may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word this morning you may be seated I would like to title my sermon this morning God's School of humility and this is part three and I would like to take for this subject of our prideful Humanity our prideful Humanity brother Branham said in the sermon Pride 19 and 55 he said oh Pride such a cursed thing it's so awful so evil is pride he said it's a cursed thing it's so evil pride is one of those things like we read in our opening scripture that it's one of the things that God hates is pride now some of us are here this morning and within our pride we are saying what is he talking about I don't have any Pride because we all have this this this imaginary uh thing of what a prideful person is of what a prideful person looks like of what of how a prideful person acts but I just want to burst your bubble this morning that every one of us that are here this morning gathered in this building every one of us have a certain amount of pride in our lives whether you like to think it or not and it's a part of our life that God hates it's a part of our life that is evil it is a part of our life that is ugly it is a part of our life that is so awful and a cursed thing we get in our minds of a prideful person as a person of arrogancy a person who is boastful a person who is always showing off a person who is always in your face they're they're just they're just prideful they're so prideful of who they are and where they come from they're prideful of their family and they just walk in and you can see it written all over them let me tell you Pride hides itself and disguises itself sometimes in humility we're going to get into this and it's going to be so good and you're going to realize that you have pride in your life that God needs to take care of we all deal with pride in one way or another whether we think it or not it doesn't matter if you are quiet natured or it doesn't matter if you are full of confidence boastful and arrogant it doesn't matter if you're poor and it doesn't matter if you're wealthy and have plenty of money to spare pride is hidden within every one of our lives pride is one of those things that has embedded within our DNA it is embedded within the genes of humanity and it's one of those things that God hates but it's a part of us now the question is why is it a part of us it's a part of us because of the Fall it's a part of us because of that Fallen nature that was injected into the to the human nature by Satan in the beginning so now because it was given into Humanity guess what it's passed on down through you don't have a choice in the matter but yet it disguises itself it disguises itself in ways that we don't realize because we have this projection of what pride is sometimes many people are prideful of the work that they accomplish they're prideful of how good it turned out they're prideful of how I'm sure the person that built this desk is extremely prideful of how it turned out because it turned out very very nicely there's many people that'll take that that Pride though which is a good thing because if you don't have pride in your workmanship your workmanship is never going to turn out well it's never going to turn out to the best of your ability if you don't have pride and ownership guess what you're not going to take care of anything you're not going to take care of your home you're not going to take care of your card if you don't have that kind of pride that's a good kind of Pride it's a good kind of Pride to have but when it when we begin to take this this piece of art that we have made this whatever it is that you do within your Workforce whenever you take that now and you're comparing it to somebody else now our pride becomes sinful so yeah you've got pride of workmanship you've got pride of ownership well praise God but now you think that it's so good that we look at something else and we say my look at that thing there's no way on my job I would leave that like that there's no way that if I was to do this work that I would leave it like that I wouldn't leave those joints opened like that I wouldn't have stained that thing that color I wouldn't have done it that way my if I was to do it my I tell you what this is how I would have done it and so now this Pride that you have in your workmanship which is good because it keeps the workmanship at a high quality but now you take that thing and you begin to comparing it to somebody that leaves it perhaps not up to your standards and now the pride in your life becomes a sinful Pride because you're comparing it and tearing down other people's stuff oh my house did you see that did you see that person's house did you see how messy their car was there's no way in my house it's spotless that might be but now look at the motive and look at the objective now that's coming behind the words that we're saying it's a sinful Pride we start comparing or when we start comparing ourselves to other people when we start comparing our workmanship uh whatever it is that you that it is that you do to other people understand it turns into a sinful Pride it's a sinful spirit and it starts so subtly have you ever seen somebody a new parent they get married no praise the Lord and a year later whatever it is there's a new baby on the way and they have their baby oh and they're so proud of that little baby so proud of that little kid and the little thing begins to grow and it begins to hold its head up by itself oh and the parents are so proud and it begins to roll over and it goes through life and it learns how to crawl then it learns how to how to walk and roll over and do all these different things and next thing you know it has a little tooth appearing and oh my for a for a for a parent with their first kid it's the best ever they're little landmarks oh and the pride of Love Is there and it's a good thing but when that parent now begins to compare their sweet little baby the best baby in the church I remember when we first had Mariah I'm gonna undo this thing I feel like my face is red it's so tight I remember when Mariah was first born and I I'm an only child I've never been around babies and so we bring her to church and everything meant she sleep through the whole service I thought man crying I didn't realize that all babies pretty much all they do is sleep eat and use the restroom in their diaper but I'm thinking oh my the greatest child ever it's good to be prideful with our children but now notice that same parent now now they go to the other people that have children that were the same age have you seen my kid has your kid rolled over yet has your kid held their head up by themselves yet well when my first kid when they were a baby they were walking up nine months your kids already 11 months and they're not even barely crawling oh my and what happens is there's a pride now that you have with your children but when you begin to compare it to other kids within the assembly guess what happens third that Pride that was once good it now turns for evil because now you're comparing Apples to Apples and you're saying well my kid is better than this one and my family is better than this and there's no way I would let my kid act like that what is happening there's a spirit of Pride that's showing its ugly face because it's seeing mine is better than yours my family is better than yours my children is better than yours whether they think they're saying it or not kids how did I tell you I'm a proud parent myself every chance I get I'm showing people pictures of my kids and all these different things because they can't believe I have five kids and that I'm 35 years old trust me it's right here look at how you can't deny them but now what happens is there's it changes now so subtly and now this Pride begins to raise up its face and now it's comparing this to that now what's wrong with comparing this to that notice how slowly this starts what happens now if you begin to compare your kids with another kid I guess I'm talking to the young families here and that's okay but yet that kid is better than yours there's there's one family in the church and let me just give you all just a warning and and then Zach and Lydia Lovell was little gwinny little gwinny was born with a tooth I believe and so if you go to Zach and you start to go well my kid started teething at this point he'll be like yeah I got you beat buddy but what happens now is you begin comparing these things and what happens if the other kid is better than your kid what happens within your spirit now you can chill why do you get jealous because you've got Pride and pride breeds contentions and so now pride is breeding this jealousy and you're like well well that's whatever you might react I don't know what it is but now because you're starting to find out that your little one or your kids or your family isn't as great as you thought it was because you start comparing it to other people guess what begins to happen now you there's a breed of contention in your heart against that family there's a little seed of envy that starts to rise up and you say Well they're better than me so you don't greet them like you should you don't talk to them and embrace them after church like you said like you should why because you're jealous and you don't even know it and what happens is now there's this there's this Envy in this this this jealousy now that that raises and rises in the heart and you don't understand why you don't understand why you can't make eye contact with that person anymore you don't understand why you can't shake their hand like you once used to it's because you were comparing and you were disappointed and you were comparing because there's pride in your life I believe that that's what's what happens with a lot of Ministries they compare themselves to other Ministries and compare this one to this one and don't compare to anything just be yourself you guys know you can only do the best you can with your children God has to do the rest well my family will never act like that don't ever say that because God is going to put you through a school of humility and he's going to Humble you when we start comparing ourselves to others and how others do things it becomes sin in our lives and guess what we all do it we are all guilty of it and we have all done it at one time or another something that started out so good something that started out so nice with with whatever the the happiness and the pride that you had in your family now it's sin in your life because we're comparing it to everyone around us saints of God just be yourselves you can't try to be another family I can't try to be the McGeary family I can't we're mcneelies we can just be ourselves we can look at the mcgaris and we could say my what a good family they've raised their kids right they're serving the lord they're musicians in the church and everything but we still gotta be ourselves and you've got to be yourself and you've got to let your kids be themselves I think that's good because you've got to let them be them you can't let them be who you think they should be and amen sure but Pride takes over our lives and because of Pride there's contentions there was contentions amongst the disciples why because they were all so prideful they wanted to know who was going to be the greatest if you want to be the greatest be the servant of all and don't wait until somebody tells you to do it but do it yourself on your own accord amen this is something that we are all extremely guilty of is having Pride in our lives Pride sometimes disguises itself it disguises itself in some ways that we can't really notice it until it pops up its ugly head once too many times it's not always just the outward person that thinks are the greatest in their family is the greatest in all these different things but sometimes it's the quiet person sometimes it's the person that can never say sorry it's the person that can never say would you forgive me it's the person that won't take the word of God and apply it to their heart why will they not walk with the word is because of pride I remember I had a brother ask me one time a friend of mine had gotten a nice vehicle and a brother had asked me he said what do you think of that person's vehicle that they got and it was a very nice very nice vehicle and this person's brother was not from the U.S he's from a different country and he said well what do you think of that vehicle I said it's very nice very nice car person deserves it they've worked hard for it well where I come from never drive a car like that really yeah we are far too humble where I come from to drive a nice vehicle like that okay and not realizing what he was saying and realizing and what he was talking about in his humility he was being prideful and he was boasting of their humility so he was thinking because this person has a nice vehicle it means that they're Vain and they have a lot of pride in their lives but his approach and his motive and objective behind it and seeing that he was trying to put that person down to make himself feel good not realizing that it was Pride in his own life that was causing him to think and say those things and so that's why I can say that Pride can disguise itself in humility Pride can disguise itself from people who are a little less fortunate with money and their wealth they think that because they're poor well the poor shall inherit the earth sure meek so shall the bride but you can't say that because I am poor because I don't have as much money as somebody else that it means that I am humble and that they're proud it's the motive that's behind it it's not the wealth but it's the motive that's behind it it's not being poor but it's the motive so now in there poorness is such a bad word I don't know what word to say less fortunate whatever I don't know no I don't go that far thank you though but they feel because of this it means that they're humble but being that way and looking at the more fortunate person that has more money and thinking that they're proud and that you're not because of the status that's a better word you're actually with the lower status you're actually prideful which is just as bad as the other so Pride now it disguises itself and it hides itself pride has wrapped itself in our DNA and we need to be able to point it out and recognize it in our lives it's all about the motive and the objective behind what's being done and what's being said I can say the exact same thing for dress code it was kind of interesting at camp this year we had a breakout session with the guys of my dorm and one thing that I had noticed around camp this year was there was quite a few young men that have began to wear necklaces within the message so I figured I'd might as well say something about it kind of discuss it a little bit and see what they thought because one thing about a minister is you've got to preach your convictions so personally myself a necklace on a man I think a necklace is extremely feminine I think a nice little dainty necklace on a woman is very pretty little bracelet whatever it is but whenever we get to put these things on a man I kind of feel like it's it's it's kind of sisified and so I had some of the brothers they told me they said well that's your opinion and I said okay fair enough that maybe my opinion but my question is this what is the motive and the objective behind wearing necklaces and Jewelry where does it end and where does it stop was it okay then for a guy to wear a bracelet is it okay for us to go ahead and get her ears pierced get her eyebrows pierced you see these two little holes here on my eyebrow yeah I have my eyebrow pierced two slices on my eyebrow on this side I have my one ear pierced I had the necklaces on gold bracelet got a gold ring put it around my necklace I had rings on my fingers I was a cool dude man slicing my eyebrow tinting my hair everything that made a guy cool I did it because I wanted to be so cool but when the Lord got a hold of my heart guess what he took away the eyebrow piercing he took away the ear piercings he took away my necklaces he took away my bracelets he took away my swag that I thought I had why because it's all worldliness and when I came into the message and I give my heart to Christ he took my worldliness and he gave me a new robe he gave me a new spirit he gave me a new desire and the things that I once loved guess what I don't love those things anymore so what's the desire about it what's the Desire with it where does it stop where does the Fashion Stop I'm gonna look my best I'm going to be Decked Out where does it stop and what's the purpose behind it what are you trying to show to people what do you want people to think about you lots of money Pride had you got good dress sense huh what are we what are we trying to show here what are you saying brother Stephen I'm just speaking from my heart I think those things are feminine brother Branham said this he said cut bangs on a on a boy's hair what does it do to him makes him a pervert so now what happens if we start taking these things which are mainly designed for women dainty pretty things and we begin to put them on boys we begin to put them on men what does it do to us as young men if a haircut did that brother Branham said I wonder what happens when we put on clothing that pertains to a woman some down home stuff here this morning but I see it and if I see it and I don't say anything Watchman what of the night what do you see up there on top of the tower let me tell you what I see I see manhood being stripped I see the the uh a man that once used to be masculine the masculinity and a man is being taken away from away from us and it's a media that's doing it oh but he looks so pretty you tell my son um Henry that he looks pretty chances are he's going to try to thump you that's a fact I'm not pretty for girls I'm handsome that's right son you are handsome ain't no pretty little thing we don't want no pretty little boys we want handsome boys strong boys that turn into handsome men and strong men and men of character [Applause] say Amen boys I know it hurts but you can say it has been taken away from us dripped from us someone's got to voice it someone's got to voice their conviction someone's got to say these things might as well be us that's just your opinion that's fine take it or leave it brother Branham said hey I have no Bible on this but this is my opinion and that's what I'm saying this morning there's no Bible on it but this is my opinion you wear a little thing like that looked like a Billy mckinstry you remember all remember Rocco my friend his dad before he passed couple years ago he told me a story one time when I was backing out and he said you know young fella and uh he's a man's man a young fella let me tell you a story okay he goes there's a a a fella everybody's a fella over there there was a fella used to walk by my house big big men wide shoulders walked straight he said and this guy you know everything about him was a man he was old man and he said one time I seen him he walked past the house and he had his ear pierced he'd come out of the army he said one time he came past the house he had his ear pierced and I'm only I'm I'm barely converted at this point barely converted I had barely taken my one earring out okay he says he was a strapping young man but when I seen that ear that earpiece in his lobe I told my wife he said that young fella is going to get sisified and I thought well okay continue the story he says and every day he'd walk past his house next thing I know he was growing his hair out next thing I know he was doing this and next thing I know he was doing that and next thing I know he was so sisified that he looked like a woman walking down the street where did it all start he said it started with the little piercing in his ear so brother Branham said with the bangs and everything where does it start it starts with us as parents at home saying hey you can't do that and this is why sisified what is it it's a spirit God help us to be aware of spirits of the end time that's trying to take away our Liberty as Christians amen I had the question within my mind and I thought what is it that God really hates about Pride if it's something that he hates so much what is the purpose of why he hates it there's got to be a reason behind it and as I begin to think upon Pride I begin to think of the examples within the scriptures and the more examples that I saw throughout the scriptures of men who Rose and fell because of Pride I begin to realize that pride in a person's life and within their heart will do one thing it'll cause them to get out of their position in Christ now follow this thought along with me Isaiah 14 13-15 it says for thou Hast said in thine heart talking of Lucifer I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit the seal the Antichrist 1955 brother Branham says did you know that in heaven that the devil was God's right-hand man in the beginning that Lucifer the son of the morning was given power and the reason that he brought sin into the world he was able to take something that God had created and perverted back into an evil thing which started all this trouble in the beginning then God back before the foundation of the world was ever laid when he's seen what Satan had done and his pride went over in the north and said up a kingdom and fought against Michael and his angels do you see it the right-hand man of almighty God was Lucifer the son of the morning the first God granted him almost co-workers with him notice he had a position in the economy of God and that position was he was co-workers with God he was a co-worker partly equal with him only Satan could not create God is the only Creator but Satan took something that God created perverted it back into something else evil and now notice when Cain and Abel a very beautiful picture of it Cain and Abel was nothing more than a prefigure of Judas and Jesus so Satan had a position in heaven it was a position that was given to him from almighty God it was a position of authority it was a position that he was almost co-equal with God and whatever happened up in heaven but because Pride got lifted up in his heart because something arose in his life and he said what I have in this position where I'm at right now is not good enough I want more I want the B is the most high God I want to be the one in control I want to be the one with all the authority and because of the pride in his life The Pride that was found in his heart guess what happened it caused him to get out of his rightful position follow me along we're with Moses now in the wilderness how many remembers Dayton and Cora you remember Dayton they rose up and they said hey ah Moses isn't the only um uh Holy One amongst us he's not the only one that can lead those people guess what there's more of us here that are just as well um qualified as he is we're just as holy as he is we're just as good as he is let's make us captains because of pride of not being able to follow the leadership of God by The Authority that God sent through Moses because of bride what did God say step aside Moses step aside I'm going to swallow them up because of their pride what about you Zaya the king God had really blessed Uzziah the king and what a mighty king he was until he got lifted up in his own Pride God had done so much good for you Zion he had given him wisdom and he made all this machinery for fighting and and different things and and and the Kingdom of Israel was at a really good place but yet something rose up in his heart and he thought I can do what I want I'm the king of this place and so I'm going to go in and I'm going to burn incense because God has been with me God has delivered me God has watched over me God has watched over Israel under my protection and under my authority guess what I can go in and through the priest's job I can go in and burn some incense it's okay because of his pride as a king he got out of his rightful position and he tried to take the position of a priest Pride will take a man out of his god-given position and will make him desire something different that he's not called to do and even when the priests they said hey please King don't do it you're not called to do this don't step out of your position you're a good King you're not a priest because of the pride in his life it turned into anger and when it turned to anger he was smote with leprosy which is a type of sin so what was it that led him to that certain point it was because of Pride that was built up in his life that he couldn't take care of let me say this Pride within the household with our sisters it'll cause them to get out of their rightful position in Christ and go to chasing after all kinds of degrees and all kinds of work and all kinds of this and all kinds of that and all kinds of the other why because of pride because of the pride of life because of the love of money because of a a better home whatever it might be because of that Pride it causes them to get out of their position that God has given to us within his word what an evil ugly nasty thing that pride is Pride will take a man in the position of a church and think that he can do better than the preacher or the pastor he's not happy with what he's doing in the assembly already and what happens Pride will raise up in his life and say I can do a better job than this person and they get out of position and they're chasing something that perhaps are not called to why because Hallelujah sometimes we have to be careful as Believers of what we say we are going to do quite often we make a plan within our minds and we say well I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that and here's my three year plan and here's my Five-Year Plan and by this time I'm going to have this and this amount of money saved and I'm going to buy a house here and and we have it all mapped out from beginning on to the ending this is my this is my life's plan and so much of the time we neglect to ask God if it's his plan for us and our time here on Earth a lot of times we make rash decisions without first encountering like brother James said on Wednesday night some God talk this is my desire this is my plan Lord but what is your will for me in my life we can read in the Book of Proverbs and James it it tells us that Proverbs 27 and verse 1 it says boast not thyself of tomorrow for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth so in other words we shouldn't be boasting of what we're going to be doing in the next week or the next month or the next years because we don't know the plan that God has for us James 4 13-16 go to now ye that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue their year and buy and sell and get game whereas you know not what shall be in the moral for what is your life it is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanisheth away for that ye ought to say so you're saying these things you're going to go into a city you're going to get great gain and you're going to do this that and the other but ye ought to say if the Lord will we shall live and do this and do that but now ye rejoice in your boasting all such rejoicing is evil so what are we supposed to say as Believers if the Lord will so I'm going to make a plan and my plan for the next three months is going to be this if the Lord will my one year plan is going to be this if the Lord will I'm going to do this in my life if the Lord will so now what does that do when you see if the Lord will you're still making plans you're still making plans for the future you're you're still planning ahead but what are you doing when you say hey this is my plan but if the Lord will I'm going to do it you're also saying this if the Lord doesn't will I'm going to be happy with it this is the plan in my life if God Wills but if it's not his plan for me I'm happy to go down a different Road I'm happy to go down a different path I'm happy to make different choices because as a son or daughter of God I want to walk in his will so that's why Jesus said not my will but thy will be done so what happens now is and whatever happens if your plans work are your plans doesn't work you're still happy in the Lord why because you're walking in the will of God I did a bid oh it was probably in March time and um and it was for a pretty nice hotel it was a Holiday Inn it kept it up nice and everything and um so big deal for me man uh hotel and and and the first thing you think when you do when you think of a hotel is is money like this is gonna be nice and so I'm crunching all these numbers and I've never I've never done a job this big before you know bidded by myself I've been a part of jobs and and helped paint them with brother Amos but I've never I've never been the boss of one so I thought well okay there's there's you know a hundred two bedrooms there's you know 60 three bedrooms whatever it was and crunch all these numbers and I think oh my goodness that's a ton of money and um so I send my submittal in and the lady goes well um Let me let me just say she called me up she said let me just say that you're very competitive okay that means you're cheap it's not what you want I said okay well let me revise it she said yes I would advise that so pretty much you know times by 33 whatever it is okay wow this is amazing and in your carnal in your carnal man you begin to think well man this could set me up and and uh set the business up and set this up and and while praise the Lord and this would be so good and and you start to think well I hope I get it but I prayed to the Lord when I was praying about it and I said father if this is not your will for me to get this job I don't want it if I can't handle the stress if I can't handle the financial burden if I can't handle trying to get guys and and handle everything that goes along with the job this size I don't want it Lord I want to walk in your will and so months passed you know and and some people ask me uh well did you hear back yet no I haven't heard back yet and you know this has been so I just put it on the back burner so it's like a month before the job was supposed to start they said Stephen give us two more weeks will you still be able to do it yeah of course yeah yeah tell me the day before I'll be there long story short get an email rejection I said okay praise the Lord I was happy and I can say before you with an Open Bible I was not discouraged one single iota I wasn't hurt my feelings wasn't hurt I didn't feel like well I could have done this and I could have done that and this that and the other no I said praise the Lord God had something else for me and so we emailed back and forth and I said well there's always next time and the lady said no we really wanted this job so it wasn't just me that didn't get the job it was the whole general contractor that did not get the job she said just so you know if we got the job as a contractor you would have got the job I didn't want to tell her you shouldn't have awarded it to me it's my fault because God didn't want me to have it but I went into the whole situation being Lord if it's your will I'll walk right through the door but if it's not your will Lord I'll walk through all the doors that you're opening for me and so because of the open-mindedness of the of the will of God and the direction in which we should walk guess what I was happy if the Lord will this is what we're going to do Hallelujah you can have that same peace because when you approach god with an open mindeness and an open heart and you say father you know my wants but if the Lord will and if you don't will I'll walk in that other will because God's no is as good as his yes questions and answers 19 1959 God has a hard time trying to get somebody that he can deal with that'll stay humble and me can stay in the place until God calls them to do something you believe that a man that God can bless and he'll still keep himself a man not be an angel or a God as soon as man gets blessed and has a little something given to him he wants to become a God he wants to become an angel he wants to become some great person what I do me and me and mine that all that's the wrong attitude God's hunting for someone who can who could bless and pour out the blessings and more he blessed the littler the man will become and you'll never get more of God until you become nothing you've got to belittle yourself he that will exalt himself God will bring a base he that will humble himself God will exalt you've got to be little before you can be big and you'll never be big in your own self you'll only be as big as God will be big in you how easy it is for a servant of God and a minister to get so lifted up within himself when God begins to bless his ministry it's like brother Yvonne said you know stars that arise they fall they're falling stars what happens is brother Branham is saying that God will take a man and he'll begin to bless his ministry and this and that and it's so hard for the man to stay humble it's so hard for the man to say uh you know what it's not me that's doing the work it's God but what we see we've seen it amongst the message for Years brother Brad I'm saying uh God will bless a man and he wants to be an angel or a god we've seen it we've seen the man that we're not called to it and when they got into that position they got so lifted up within their pride that had caused a whole mess why because they're going into a position that they're not called to and what does it mess up it messes up their own life and everybody who's sitting underneath their Ministry it's just a mess why because pride gets raised up within their lives so easy for a man to get exalted I remember when I prayed for this sick person and they got healed I remember I preached such a dynamic service that the power of God failed and it was all because of me and and my Ministry and this person no no no no no no it's not because of you it wasn't because of you praying for the sick person that it got healed it was because of their faith it was because of God it was because of God moving on the scene so there's that fine balance of giving a testimony and saying well glory to God he did this back then and saying when I did this I prayed for this sick person I prayed for that I did this I did that it's so easy for us as Ministry to get caught up with it I don't know if I put the code in here or not but I'll just say it anyways brother Brandon was talking about um it was the next service and he was talking about the service before and how they didn't give out prayer cards and and so now he's going to hand out prayer cards and uh uh the night before they didn't hand out prayer cards but they didn't need the prayer cards he said and I called the people out in the audience he was talking about the Holy Spirit he goes excuse me excuse me I didn't mean to say that he said he called the people out it wasn't me that did it you see he realized his wording was of a prideful uh substance and he said I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that it wasn't me that was God I don't know these people I don't know their names I don't know where they'd come from I don't know their sickness but he knows and so I think it's so important for us to be very careful because God has a body that he uses and that's the Bride of Jesus Christ and we claim that that's us right so when God uses you because he has no other hands ears eyes nose hands no other tongue but yours when God uses you it's important to say this is what happened but God be the glory it wasn't me that done it I didn't have the words but it was God Almighty that did the works amen the anointed ones at the end time now I want you to know this is sure and you that listen to this tape you might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself being that I was packing this message I have no more to do with it than nothing and no more than just a voice so what is he doing now he's saying hey this isn't me this isn't nothing to do with me I'm just a voice I'm just a vessel this is God I have no more to do with it than nothing just a voice of my voice even against my own better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father that I declare to do and and determined to do I wasn't the one that appeared down in the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are I'm only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man notice he's given all the glory to God because he realizes he has nothing to do with it against my own better judgment he says it's God God the angel was not the son of man you hear what he's saying this seventh angel messenger is not the son of man Hallelujah now he's distinguishing who he is and who he is not and so when we try to put him in that place we're misquoting we're mislocating we are doing the things that he told us not to do he said the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the Son of Man the son of man is not Christ well the son of man is Christ sorry that's what I get for looking up thank you he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man what is he doing he's distinguishing himself he's saying as John the Baptist Hallelujah he says his shoe shoelaces I'm not even worthy to lease there's one that's coming after me I'm not I'm not even worthy to be on the same platform as this guy this guy that's coming behind he's the one that'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire he's the one that you need to look to it's not me he's doing the exact same thing he's saying hey this is not me I'm just a messenger but because of misquoting things like I just did see how easy it is now can you imagine English not being the first language can you imagine a people that we're not paying attention to the quote this corrects a lot of good stuff I'm glad it happened can you imagine not putting the court up here and I'm reading it and I make a mistake because I'm a man and I make a mistake and I'm getting caught up with looking around me and trying to preach that I don't read the thing correctly and it's not up here what does everybody think they think what I said because I'm reading from a quote so the importance of putting it up here for everybody to see the quote you can say hey preacher you made a mistake you said it wrong say it right but without this without a people that's listening without a people that's doing their homework guess what there's mislocations there's Miss quotations it gets out of order the cart gets before the horse next thing you know is the cows on top of the tree pecking grass why all because of a simple mistake amen thank you Lord this school of humility is a school that each one of us must go through possibly many times within our lives because it is within our human nature for Pride to rise in our hearts and in our lives time and time again why because it is wrapped and it is Twisted within our DNA and it'll poke up its ugly face every once in a while and so God now has to take us through a school of humility to keep us humble before his very sight and we'll get into it in the next service of why he does that why does he want to keep us humble why does he not want us being proud the scripture has the answer the door to the heart 1958 Pride keeps us from doing it we're afraid somebody will say something against us when the spirit blesses many are ashamed to say Amen we should never be ashamed to say Amen there is many who in their office work the Lord Jesus could have healed them of diseases and they're afraid to testify to the glory of God because of Pride many are afraid to stand and say I have received Christ as my personal Savior and have been filled with the Holy Spirit they're ashamed oh I love that little old song we used to sing years ago down in the rich country I'll take my way with the Lord despise few I've started with Jesus and I'm going through not ashamed of the gospel Paul said it's the power of God Pride oh what a great thing that it is Pride he says keeps us from doing it so what does pride keep us from doing Pride keeps us from fulfilling the word of God Pride keeps us from applying the word of God to our hearts even when it's contrary to our own reasonings and thinkings Pride keeps us from it well I know the Bible said that and yeah I know it says about modesty and I know it says about this but I just can't do it I don't want to do it I don't want to testify to people I don't want to tell people that I'm a Christian why because well I'm just too shy I'm not loud like you I'm not boastful and Brash like you are yeah I'm quiet so I don't say anything they'll know Pride Pride will keep you from testifying to the person who's in the cubicle next to you at work you don't know what they'll think about me well who cares Pride will keep you from testifying to the people at school and people at work of what God is doing in your life Pride see pride disguising itself well they might ask me to play ball anymore I mightn't be a part of the boys anymore I mightn't be there say yeah Pride see we all have a certain amount of pride that's keeping us from the word of God being fulfilled in our lives but I thought proud I thought it was just bash and boastful and and all these different things no no no no no no no Pride will keep you from doing it Pride will keep you from saying sorry when you were wrong Pride will keep you from asking for help we're in your when you're in a hard spot Pride will keep you from reaching out to those that you know need help you say well it's just my um what's what's the word um uh the thing that you struggle with in your mind your uh complexes yeah that's my complex it's not it's not as your pride your pride oh blame it on your complexes Pride right why is there contentions amongst us you know a soft answer turns away Wrath so if there's contentions in a family what is the issue it's not how you were raised it's not how your mom and dad acted because a lot of us blame that stuff from Mom and Dad it's not because how your family was not just because of your pride that you can't swallow it and make things right amen it is pride that keeps us from doing or fulfilling the word of God in our lives when we hear it and that's why God has to put us through these times of testings and Times of Trials because he wants to take the pride out of our Lives because he wants a humble people that he can work through and live in as the musicians come we'll start bringing this to a close trials and testings exactly you know they're sent from God there's many reasons and many things why we go through these trials and testings but the main purpose of it is because God is working on our character like gold tried in the fire Robert didn't know what I was preaching on so what is it this God has one thing that he wants to bring forth in our lives and that's the christ-like character which comes as pure gold and what does the what does the fire do what does the trials do what do these things that we go through it burns up the dross and burns up the things the word hay and the stubble in our lives that doesn't belong there and it makes us get serious in humility with God because we realize you know what a trial does you know when you mess up in your life do you know what it does when you make a mistake it makes you realize where you're at because God knows exactly where you're at in your life he knows exactly where you're at in your journey but he wants you to realize where you're at and he wants you to realize the things that you need to work on as a believer [Music] and so he'll put something in your life that'll cause your feathers to get all fluffy it cause you to get all ruffled up why because he wants you to realize what you need to work on [Music] so Peter in our opening scripture [Music] it said Jesus had told him Peter's one of these guys man you talk about an outward appearance of pride and arrogance and boastful and and and just and just put the sword in his hand and I'll I'll live and I'll die by The Sword and I'll do this and if there was one person it's Peter there's anybody that's going to sit with Jesus it's going to be me I tell you what so now Peter was a man that was chosen of God [Music] but in that present State he could not be used by God because his character and his attitude and his life wasn't right because if God would have used him for something guess what he would have took all the glory to himself so Jesus says to him Satan once has desired to sift you as weed Peter you know what sifting wheat is it's going on the thrashing floor is being beat and the wheat is being beaten and after the wheat is beaten it's thrown up in the air and what's happening is it's a separation time the weed is beat because that hard Shale that surrounds it has got to be broken open so the the pure seed can come forth he says Satan has desired to sift you just as this week but I have prayed for you Peter are you listening put your name there [Music] Satan has desired to sift you as wheat but Jesus has prayed for you did not know that he was going to go through some of the darkest few days and weeks of his life the greatest temptations that he let himself down he let the disciples down he let the Savior down he let everybody around him down by his actions of denying the Lord but yet God was using this this trial this dark place in his life because he had a work for him to do in the future [Music] do you think that humble Peter I bet your bottom dollar did I deny them [Music] I've been following him all these years and it came to the time when he needed me and I wasn't there for him do you think he slept at night do you think he was doing good in his life no it was a time of Darkness it was a time of trial it was a time of pain but yet in the darkness God was molding his character and so now we find Peter after Pentecost him and John they go to the temple to pray Acts 3 verse 12 and it says and when Peter saw it he answered unto the people a man of Israel why Marvel ye at this or why look ye so earnestly in us as though by our own power or Holiness we have made this man to walk what had happened they were going to pray and there was a man that was lame everybody knew him he was always there at the same spot and he pulled him up to his feet the Lord Jesus healed him miraculously and he went and he was he was he was walking and he was jumping and he was leaping and he was praising God and so now Peter says what I just read why are you looking at us why are you looking at me we have nothing to do with this it wasn't anything that we had done but it was him who you have crucified who's been raised from the dead he is the one that give this man back his health a week or two prior to that no doubt Peter would have said look what we did they rejoiced they rejoiced you remember they said oh even the devils are subject onto US praise the Lord we're gonna do some things for God and everything is subject onto us and God is going to the miraculous things they were rejoicing that things were subject to them earlier on in the scriptures but now he says hey guess what I know for a fact that I have nothing to do with this because I denied him I let him down I let everybody down if God does something through me it's God that's doing it and I'm going to give God the glory and so now his attitude and his character now was molded and it's changed through the trial and the suffering in the dark place that he went through that's what God now has to do with every single believer he has to take us through the school of humility so that we realize hey guess what I know my faults I know my failures I know the things that I struggle through and if God does something for you through me guess what all glory be to the most high God [Music] so why does God take us through this school because he has no other body that he uses but his own body and so now so that we don't get high and lifted up within our own lives because of this Pride that has weaned itself through our DNA guess what he has to do he has to put us through a sifting time a time of separation a time of separating the flesh from the spirit a time of separating the natural and the spiritual man why is he doing it because he has a purpose for your life in the future let's Stand Together sometimes we ask and we say why you'll find out soon enough a lot of times we look back in our lives then we realize uh-huh now I understand now I realize why [Music] foreign what's god making known to you this morning he's making known to you guess what in your humility guess what you got Pride in your wealth guess what you got pride and you're not so being wealthy guess what you got Pride within this carnal man there's nothing but Pride that dwells within them and so now as Believers we need to realize and say where is the pride in my life [Music] what good is it preaching about it what good is it and mention it and showing it throughout the scriptures and everything if we don't do anything about it [Music] if you don't do anything about it it'll do you no good so what are you going to do with this word this morning [Music] because you have two choices [Music] Choice number one is you can accept the challenge and you can accept that it's true and say you know what I can be pretty prideful whether it's with my family with my work whatever it may be I don't know but are you going to recognize it and do something about it are you just going to sit in your pride and say that wasn't for me I don't have no Pride that he's talking about the choice is yours so the challenges went forth what are you going to do with this Jesus called Christ what are you going to do with this Challenge and this word that has went forth [Music] I'm going to do my best and do something about it in my own life because it starts right here [Music] I care we had a [Music] I was ministering or whatever on the Thursday night and I said you know what guys you need to yield to the spirit you need to feed the spirit through prayer and reading your Bible and so I said how about you get up in the morning before devotion and you go and you pray and you read your Bible and seek God I said you know what I'll go with you I'll be there whether you're there or not I'll be there I think to myself afterwards why do I do this to myself yeah be at church nine o'clock okay I'll be there it's because I want to lead by example and I found out to my surprise that the first day man there's probably 25 young man there 6 30 in the morning we didn't talk we didn't say a word I never spoke we sat and we had our own personal time with God they met the challenge of the word the next morning there was probably 30 young people there and so they sat through that now why were they doing that it wasn't because of me it's because they have the desire to seek out God and the challenge went forth and they met the challenge and I know that our desire this morning as we want to be like our Lord we want to have a closer walk with him the challenge has went forth now are you going to meet the challenge of the hour and say father show me show me if I don't know Lord show me because I want to do something about it show me where my pride is show me my faults Lord because my desire is a son and daughter of God let's pray this morning Father we love you so much Lord Lord I personally feel challenged by Your Word in my own life father God Pride sometimes it can disguise itself Lord and many times it goes unnoticed and your word says that you hate that thing Lord we don't want to do anything that hates you that you hate but Lord we want to do that which is pleasing in thy sight and so I asked this morning that you would help us as a body as individuals Lord revealed to us father our short goings and our shortcomings that Pride that's in our life father reveal it to us that we might give it to thee Lord for we know that you'll take nothing from US unless it's given to you we
