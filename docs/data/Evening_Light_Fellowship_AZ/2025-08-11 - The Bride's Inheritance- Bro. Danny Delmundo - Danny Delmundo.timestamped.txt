[12:06] All the unspoken requests that were not
[12:09] pinned down today, we also bring those
[12:11] to you. But Lord, we just ask
[12:15] just for your
[12:18] your presence upon us during this
[12:20] ministering of the word
[12:22] &gt;&gt; that you'd touch us all with our needs
[12:25] today.
[12:26] We just ask that you would
[12:29] just give us
[12:33] a little deeper revelation. And we we
[12:36] always want that because that's that's
[12:39] our growth.
[12:40] And we just ask that you would touch
[12:42] each and every one of us today in Jesus

[31:22] Let the blood of Calvary speak for me.
[31:24] If you're familiar with the song, you'll
[31:25] notice the words have been changed a
[31:26] little bit to make it more fitting to
[31:28] the bride. So, if you're wondering why
[31:30] it's a little different, can I read take
[31:32] this quote from the token? Also,
[31:35] the blood of Jesus Christ covers all of
[31:37] our sins and speaks peace and
[31:41] resurrection and power and life and
[31:43] healing and all the redemptive blessings
[31:45] that the blood was shed for, it speaks
[31:49] for us. Certainly. Certainly, the blood
[31:51] speaks. Amen.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:01] [Music]
[32:03] When the harvest
[32:06] has been gathered
[32:08] and all
[32:10] the work is done.
[32:13] When the last mile
[32:15] is traveled and this earthly
[32:20] race is run.
[32:22] When I'm called to that dimension
[32:27] just beyond
[32:29] this mortal sea,
[32:31] then let the blood of Calvary
[32:37] speak
[32:38] for me.
[32:41] [Music]
[32:43] May he write me down as righteous where
[32:47] no righteousness
[32:50] has been. shielding me from wrath and
[32:55] judgment as it covers
[32:59] all my sin. There's no work that I've
[33:04] accomplished, nor my goodness would I
[33:08] plead.
[33:10] Just let the blood of Calvary
[33:15] speak
[33:17] for me.
[33:20] [Music]
[33:25] There are friends that bring us comfort
[33:29] when they speak a word so kind.
[33:34] But their voicees
[33:36] are still temporal.
[33:39] in this the space of time. But there's a
[33:44] voice that calls for mercy ringing
[33:48] through
[33:50] eternity.
[33:51] Well, just let that voice of mercy
[33:57] speak
[33:58] for me.
[34:02] May he write me down as righteous where
[34:07] no righteousness
[34:10] has been shielding me from wrath and
[34:15] judgment as it covers
[34:18] all my sin. There's no work that I've
[34:23] accomplished
[34:25] nor my goodness would I plead.
[34:30] Just let the blood of Calvary
[34:34] speak
[34:36] for me.
[34:38] There's no work that I've accomplished,
[34:42] nor my goodness would I plead.
[34:47] Just let the blood of Calvary
[34:52] speak
[34:54] for me.
[34:56] [Music]
[35:01] Hallelujah Lord.

[36:14] me at that time.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We're happy to have um a
[36:20] guest speaker with us today, Brother
[36:21] Danny Delmundo.
[36:23] He is from the Philippines

[36:31] different parts of Asia, Indonesia,
[36:35] and throughout Philippines and over into

[36:44] be people when we get over there that
[36:47] maybe you never heard of, never uh, you
[36:50] know, they weren't the big names. They
[36:52] didn't uh, but the unsung heroes that go
[36:56] to different places
[36:58] &gt;&gt; out of the way to just a few people.
[37:00] They get them baptized and and

[37:13] song this morning here as we change
[37:16] order of the service. Jehovah Gyra.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra. You know in the Old
[37:21] Testament when the old patriarchs
[37:25] when God came down and met their needs,
[37:30] it was a supernatural event. And those
[37:34] men spake as God gave them utterance.
[37:37] And
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Abraham said, "I name this place Jehovah
[37:42] Gyra."
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Others said, "I name it Jehovah Raa.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; I hope uh this is Jehovah Shalom."
[37:50] &gt;&gt; Of the seven redemptive names of Elohim.
[37:55] Hallelujah.
[37:58] You think about it in those seven
[38:00] redemptive names. Whatever need
[38:04] that you have need of
[38:07] You call upon
[38:10] your creator.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; And he'll give you a blessing from one
[38:15] of those seven redemptive names. You
[38:17] need peace, I'll give you shalom.
[38:20] [Music]
[38:22] &gt;&gt; You have a need, I'm Jehovah Gyra.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Robert, help me sing this
[38:27] song here as we go to worship and turn
[38:30] the order of the service.

[41:41] Hallelujah.

[42:08] cannot do anything.

[42:10] &gt;&gt; Before anything else, I would like to
[42:11] thank brother Ron for uh having me uh

[42:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; And with the little portion that the
[42:36] Lord has placed in my heart, I believe
[42:39] we'll also have a place in yours.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; So I greet you in the name of the Lord

[43:44] open door right there. See my I I saw

[43:50] Amen. So I'm also scheduled to minister

[44:20] uh the book of numbers. Amen.
[44:27] And numbers
[44:30] 27 we read from verse one
[44:34] and up to 11. Just bear with me. Amen.
[44:38] So it says here in chapter 27:E1, "Then
[44:43] came the daughters of Zilofiad,
[44:47] the son of Heper, the son of Gilead, the
[44:50] son of Makir, the son of Manasse, of the
[44:54] families of Manasse, the son of Joseph.
[44:57] And these are the names of his
[44:59] daughters, Mahala, Noah, and Hogla, and
[45:04] Mila, and Tiraza.
[45:07] And they stood before Moses and before
[45:09] Eleazar the priest and before the
[45:12] princes and all the congregation by the
[45:14] door of the tabernacle of the
[45:16] congregation, saying, "Our father died
[45:20] in the wilderness, and he was not in the
[45:22] company of them that gathered themselves
[45:24] together against the Lord in the company
[45:27] of Kora, but died in his own sin, and
[45:30] had no sons.
[45:33] Why should the name of our father be
[45:35] done away from among his family? Because
[45:38] he hath no son. Give unto us therefore a
[45:42] possession among the brethren of our
[45:44] father. And Moses brought their cause
[45:47] before the Lord. And the Lord spake unto
[45:49] Moses, saying,
[45:51] The daughters of Zilopiad speak right.
[45:55] Thou shalt surely give them a possession
[45:57] of an inheritance among their fathers,
[46:00] brethren, and thou shalt cause the
[46:02] inheritance of their father to pass unto
[46:05] them. And thou shalt speak unto the
[46:07] children of Israel, saying, If a man die
[46:10] and have no son, then ye shall cause his
[46:14] inheritance to pass unto his daughter.
[46:16] And if he have no daughter, then you
[46:19] shall give his inheritance unto his
[46:20] brethren. And if he has no brethren,
[46:23] then you shall give his inheritance unto
[46:24] his father's brethren. And if his father
[46:27] have no brethren, then you shall give
[46:30] his inheritance unto his kinsman that is
[46:34] next to him of his family, and he shall
[46:37] possess it, and it shall be unto the
[46:40] children of Israel, a statute of
[46:42] judgment, as the Lord commanded Moses.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord adds blessing to the
[46:49] reading of his word. Dear heavenly
[46:50] father, as we approach your throne of
[46:53] mercy this morning, we are entirely
[46:56] dependent upon you, Lord, we we need the
[46:59] substance of your word. It's your
[47:02] revelation that steers our faith, Lord
[47:04] God. And uh uh just anoint this uh uh
[47:09] mouth of lips, Lord, that uh uh that
[47:12] anything that would come out of it,
[47:14] Lord, will be a a little blessing to
[47:17] your bride here. So we thank you. We
[47:19] commit this service into your mighty
[47:21] hands in Jesus Christ's wonderful name.
[47:24] And everybody say amen this morning.
[47:27] Hallelujah. God bless you. You may now
[47:29] be seated. All right. Amen. So uh we
[47:34] would like to give a uh title on this
[47:38] message.
[47:40] The bride's inheritance.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Claiming time. Amen.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; How many believe it's claiming time?
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So uh uh we are in the last
[47:54] part of this age that we are living in
[47:58] and uh uh the Lord has bestowed upon us.
[48:02] He has given us the full revelation of
[48:05] his word. And I believe that full
[48:08] revelation of his word place us in our
[48:11] rightful position and uh to be able to
[48:15] understand to be able to uh uh to know
[48:20] amen uh what is allotted for us in this
[48:25] generation. And I believe another point
[48:28] that uh uh by by by knowing our
[48:30] position, recognizing our inheritance,
[48:34] Amen. It takes the right attitude, the
[48:38] right character to be able to claim what
[48:41] really belongs to us.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why now in this uh uh
[48:48] part of the scripture, we will see that
[48:51] in Numbers 27:E1,
[48:54] let me just read it. It said, "Then came
[48:56] the daughters of Zilopiah, the son of
[48:58] Heper, the son of Gilead, the son of
[49:01] Makir, the son of Manasse, of the
[49:03] families of Manasseh, the son of Joseph.
[49:05] And these are the names of his
[49:07] daughters, Mala, Noah, and Hogla, and
[49:10] Mila and Ta." Now notice that there had
[49:17] not been a time
[49:20] uh
[49:22] uh during this time uh uh it didn't
[49:26] happen that women claim inheritance
[49:31] that belong to their fathers.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; There was no record.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. when this happened. Uh because if
[49:40] we move backward, if we move in chapter
[49:43] 26 verse 54, to many thou shalt give the
[49:47] more inheritance, and to few thou shalt
[49:49] give the less inheritance, to everyone
[49:53] shall his inheritance be given according
[49:56] to those that were numbered of him,
[49:57] notwithstanding, the land shall be
[49:59] divided by lot, according to the names
[50:02] of the tribes of their fathers, they
[50:04] shall inherit. So the inheritance,
[50:07] Amen, are being uh h uh uh transferred
[50:12] or or or delegated being turned over.
[50:16] Amen. Uh h uh under one headship to to
[50:20] the other.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Right.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. No women, no women in the past,
[50:25] Amen. claimed inheritance.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Right. God bless you, brother Neil.
[50:30] Amen. So now we see here but at this
[50:33] point in time the very first time it
[50:35] happened amen that women
[50:39] claim
[50:41] inheritance.
[50:44] So they ask uh uh so that's why if we
[50:49] mention that that's why even in Joshua
[50:51] in chapter 17 verse3
[50:54] uh Joshua mentioned these five women the
[50:59] daughters of Zilopiad and I believe
[51:02] Joshua had a reference in mentioning
[51:04] them. He said, "Now, but Zilopia, the
[51:06] son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the
[51:08] son of Machir, the son of Manasse, had
[51:10] no sons but daughters, and these are the
[51:14] names of his daughters, Mala and Noah,
[51:17] Hogla, Mila, and Tza." So Joshua
[51:23] mentioned these five women as an
[51:26] example.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Joshua remembered these five
[51:30] women. Amen. Who stood their ground.
[51:33] Amen.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Realizing that their fathers had
[51:38] worked hard. Amen. To uh uh to have some
[51:41] some kind of properties and and and and
[51:44] and they they fully understood that uh
[51:48] uh their fathers wanted to uh uh to give
[51:52] something
[51:54] &gt;&gt; to his children.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; But it so happened that had no sons.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; No. All right.
[52:03] Now in the Bible,
[52:07] women are even very seldom
[52:12] being made mentioned unless there is a
[52:16] vital or a uh significant
[52:20] uh involvement.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Now that's why in the uh in the Bible we
[52:26] we hear about uh uh Rahab,
[52:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. We uh in in in in Hebrews in
[52:34] chapter 11 we the all the heroes of
[52:37] faith the hall of fame in the Bible.
[52:41] Amen. In the Old Testament they were
[52:42] they were their names were written
[52:45] there. Amen. But you will see the name
[52:49] of Rahab
[52:51] &gt;&gt; there.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You will see Sarah there. Amen.
[52:55] And and so uh these are names being
[52:58] mentioned because they fulfilled some
[53:01] significant
[53:03] uh uh uh roles.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. That would be a that would be an
[53:08] example uh something they have done
[53:10] something that is so monumental. Amen.
[53:14] That is worthy of being remembered. So I
[53:18] believe it's the same thing here that
[53:20] these five daughters of Zilopi had amen
[53:24] uh had been mentioned because they they
[53:28] uh uh they made something the change.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Uh uh they were game
[53:34] changers.
[53:36] And I believe that's the same thing with
[53:38] the bride today.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; The bride is a game changer today.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In this changing of
[53:44] dispensation. Amen. where we are
[53:46] stepping from you know uh from the age
[53:50] stepping into the into the blending our
[53:52] time into eternity. Amen. This is uh uh
[53:55] this is the meeting of two ages.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; All right. And the bride is here as a
[54:01] game changer.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now we see here mentioned
[54:07] so we have we have hear about Eve. We
[54:09] have heard about Sarah Rahab. Amen. Uh
[54:12] there are only two books in the
[54:14] scriptures in the in in in the Bible.
[54:16] Amen. Named after women. We said we have
[54:18] Ruth and we have Esther.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we see in the books of Esther
[54:25] and Ruth. Amen. The great love story.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it speaks about the bride and
[54:30] the bridegroom. Hallelujah. When we
[54:33] remember Ruth, we know uh uh it is only
[54:36] composed of four chapters but it is so
[54:39] meaningful. Amen. We book about we read
[54:42] about Esther and we see how Amen. Uh
[54:45] Esther have changed uh uh uh uh uh the
[54:49] uh the natural course of uh of of of
[54:53] marriage you know and uh uh uh so it's
[54:56] the same thing in the church ages we
[54:59] come up at the conclusion time.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this we have come into what we
[55:05] call the bride age.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in this bride age, when you
[55:10] realize you are the bride of Christ, you
[55:13] know who you are.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; You know what your position is.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you know what you're
[55:19] claiming for.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's why you know there
[55:24] are there are five. And it it it is not
[55:26] uh uh uh a coincidence that they were
[55:29] five because in the New Testament in
[55:32] Matthew chapter 25 there are 10 virgins.
[55:35] Amen. And five of them are wise.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I believe these five
[55:40] daughters of Celopead, they were
[55:46] &gt;&gt; wise.
[55:49] Amen. And so let me read my first quote.
[55:52] I know this is very uh uh very familiar,
[55:55] but let's be refreshed on this. Amen.
[55:59] The scripture Christ in the true church
[56:01] is a continuation of the book of Acts.
[56:05] Amen. So let me read that. Now remember
[56:07] this. Christ in the true church is a
[56:11] continuation of the book of Acts.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; But the book of Revelation shows how
[56:17] that the antichrist spirit would come
[56:20] into the church and defile it,
[56:23] &gt;&gt; making it lukewarm,
[56:25] formal, and powerless. Now remember the
[56:29] antichrist, amen, is no longer
[56:32] interested in the Roman Catholic Church.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; He's no longer interested in the
[56:38] denominational system. We are in the
[56:40] last days.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; I believe his focus now is here, right
[56:45] here in the message movement.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; He's trying to deceive the bride, the
[56:51] elect,
[56:53] &gt;&gt; if it's possible.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; But no, it's not. Amen.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we are in the word.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; We are part of the word.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the bride cannot be
[57:05] deceived. Amen. So we recognize the two
[57:08] spirits.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like when the seed was being
[57:12] thrown in the same field. Amen.
[57:14] Hallelujah. Now the two seeds are also
[57:17] in the same field
[57:20] &gt;&gt; called church.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the bride that is so
[57:25] wise,
[57:27] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, can discern the spirit,
[57:30] &gt;&gt; can identify the spirit, hallelujah,
[57:33] because the word is able, it has a
[57:36] cutting ability, it can even divide even
[57:39] the soul and the spirit.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now it says book uh uh it
[57:46] exposes Satan revealing his works,
[57:50] attempted destruction of God's people
[57:52] and the discrediting of God's word. I
[57:55] know you're aware of that.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; They're trying to discredit the prophet
[57:59] in this generation. They try to
[58:01] discredit the message.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; They're trying to discredit the
[58:05] testimonies, but they're too late.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:10] Now, right down to the time he is cast
[58:12] into the lake of fire, he fights that
[58:15] the message. He cannot stand it.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; He knows that if the people get the true
[58:23] revelation of the true church and what
[58:26] she is and what she stands for and she
[58:30] can do the greater works, she will be an
[58:34] invincible army.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She will be and she is
[58:40] &gt;&gt; that's right
[58:41] &gt;&gt; an invincible army right now there is a
[58:44] bride
[58:45] &gt;&gt; hallelujah that knows who she is and
[58:48] what she is standing for
[58:51] &gt;&gt; that's why she cannot be defeated
[58:54] &gt;&gt; hallelujah because of the word
[58:56] &gt;&gt; hallelujah now another quote now we
[58:59] believe there must be a reason why we
[59:01] know who we are
[59:03] &gt;&gt; because we are being fed by the revealed
[59:05] word of the hour
[59:07] &gt;&gt; amen Thank you, Lord.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're feeding on the body word of
[59:10] the son of man.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, in paragraph 166, in putting
[59:15] on the whole armor of God, the prophet
[59:17] said, "Now God fortified his army with
[59:21] what?"
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Himself.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; That's right, sir.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. He fortified his army with
[59:32] himself,
[59:34] &gt;&gt; his person,
[59:37] &gt;&gt; his power,
[59:39] &gt;&gt; his word.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Through what he said, in the form of
[59:43] prophets,
[59:45] &gt;&gt; apostles, teachers, pastors, the
[59:48] five-fold ministry. Amen. He fortified
[59:51] his army with himself in the form of the
[59:56] five-fold ministry. Amen.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; And what are these fivefold ministry?
[1:00:04] What was God doing? Listen, did you ever
[1:00:06] think what that offices of the church
[1:00:08] is? It's God's dress.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; The whole armor.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; So, it's God's dress. The five-fold
[1:00:20] ministry is God's dress.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And listen what verse it that it
[1:00:26] follows. Not just God's rest inside
[1:00:30] dress.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:35] Amen. So we have dress but we still have
[1:00:38] inside dress.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; And that said God fortified his army his
[1:00:42] bride with the pip in the form of the
[1:00:45] pipled ministry. Amen. And the pipled
[1:00:48] ministry is God's inside dress.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Why inside dress? Hallelujah. Because
[1:00:55] the inside dress is what touches the
[1:00:58] skin.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; He fortified his army with himself, the
[1:01:05] word
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; through the pipled ministry. And this
[1:01:09] pipled ministry are experienced pipled
[1:01:13] ministry.
[1:01:15] They're being born again. They have an
[1:01:17] experience with the word. They are so
[1:01:19] tied with the word.
[1:01:21] The inside dress is what really touches
[1:01:24] the skin and they have personal
[1:01:26] experience with the word.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; You don't just you know pipled ministry
[1:01:31] is not just knowing the the scripture
[1:01:33] knowing the word memorizing all these
[1:01:35] quotes so and so on and you can name the
[1:01:38] message and you can even mention the
[1:01:40] page the paragraph and what title of the
[1:01:43] message is. Hallelujah. It's good but
[1:01:45] that's not all.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible ministry must be
[1:01:50] exposed with the personal experiences
[1:01:52] with the word. It has personal touch of
[1:01:55] the skin.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; The word being made blessed.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is the kind of the
[1:02:05] ministry that will fortify his army, his
[1:02:09] bride. Amen. Hallelujah. And so now he
[1:02:12] said now he said for seeing it before
[1:02:14] Satan never gets to it. Dan told it what
[1:02:16] is it? God dressed up in his church. Now
[1:02:21] in his church, this offices is God's
[1:02:24] dress wear. When you see those offices,
[1:02:26] pastors, teachers, evangelists, what is
[1:02:28] that? That is God's dress, God's
[1:02:31] presence.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; God's spirit and working through men.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what brother said.
[1:02:40] Show me a church. Show me an individual.
[1:02:43] Hallelujah. That you can see Christ. And
[1:02:45] let me tell you once again that here on
[1:02:47] earth Christ is walking again in the
[1:02:50] flesh.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now so this is what makes up
[1:02:59] the bride.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now look at this.
[1:03:07] Daughters of Copiad
[1:03:10] in verse two
[1:03:13] numbers 27. And they stood before Moses
[1:03:17] and before Elizar the priest and before
[1:03:20] the princes and all the congregation by
[1:03:23] the door of the tabernacle of the
[1:03:25] congregation saying
[1:03:28] Moses
[1:03:29] brought their cost before the Lord.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Saying
[1:03:35] speaking the word
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; they speak their claim.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. They don't complain. They speak
[1:03:45] out their claim.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; And the good thing here, brother and
[1:03:50] sister, now listen in verse, they stood
[1:03:53] before Moses and Moses was the prophet.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. In in in uh uh you you do it in a
[1:04:04] micro form. Moses was their pastor.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:11] They know how to handle their claim.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; They know who to approach.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; They know where to go.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; They don't go from one house to another
[1:04:28] and speak out and complain on something.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; No. No. No. No.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; They did not approach any other
[1:04:37] minister.
[1:04:40] No, they they approached their pastor
[1:04:44] Moses.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; And they stood before Moses and before
[1:04:52] Elizer the priest and before the princes
[1:04:55] and all the congregation by the door of
[1:04:59] the tabernacle of the congregation.
[1:05:02] That's why Amen. the prophet of God
[1:05:05] encouraged us to have a home church.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the place we go to.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; It's the place we support.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. With our presence,
[1:05:17] with our tithes and offering, that's
[1:05:18] where we go to.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is our family.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if ever we have problems, we we
[1:05:26] we don't go to some others. Amen. That's
[1:05:29] the time you feel you have a pastor.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So here neon they were they were
[1:05:37] five women daughters and I believe they
[1:05:40] were taught correctly by their father.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And because they did the right
[1:05:47] thing, they approached the right person.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; They were not refused.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; And listen what in verse five, let's
[1:06:01] jump in verse five. Notice what Moses
[1:06:04] said. And Moses brought their cost
[1:06:07] before the Lord.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a pastor.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; That all problems, you know, they're
[1:06:16] being brought. Amen. At the feet of the
[1:06:19] Lord Jesus.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you know what? Moses had to
[1:06:23] take some time
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; because Moses had no reference to that.
[1:06:29] Yeah.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; They presented their cause. They
[1:06:33] presented they were claiming something.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; And it never happened before.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; But although it didn't happen before,
[1:06:45] Moses did not come into conclusion and
[1:06:48] rejected what these five women
[1:06:49] presented.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Amen. Let me speak to the
[1:06:56] Lord. Give me a little time. Yeah.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Don't rush me. Is that okay?
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Don't rush me.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give me time. It we we have no
[1:07:04] reference to that. But you know, I'll
[1:07:08] take some time. I'll pray about it.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; I speak to the Lord.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And so that's why, you
[1:07:17] know, uh because they did the right
[1:07:19] thing. Amen. Uh uh they heard also the
[1:07:23] right thing.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:26] uh uh you know our pastor is not just a
[1:07:29] pastor in good times.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; He remains our pastor even in our
[1:07:36] hardest times
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; in our worst moment of experience.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; There you have your pastor.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; That's where the shepherd is.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; And said listen, wait a little bit. I
[1:07:50] pray about it.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because that's the way amen
[1:07:56] we should you know the the the prophet
[1:07:58] encourage us to love our pastors to
[1:08:00] support our pastor and that's why he
[1:08:03] encouraged us to have you know uh
[1:08:06] brother Bham made mention some he told
[1:08:08] the story about you know about a person
[1:08:14] uh there's another quote for that he
[1:08:15] said it's different when you're included
[1:08:17] in it yourself. So before brother Benham
[1:08:21] mentioned this, he he cited uh an
[1:08:25] illustration. He said, you know,
[1:08:26] sometimes the uh uh uh maybe a a pastor
[1:08:31] or and a deacon uh they go together,
[1:08:34] they talk and you know, the pastor said,
[1:08:36] you know, hey uh uh you see that you see
[1:08:40] that rushing river?
[1:08:43] Yeah. Yes, pastor.
[1:08:45] And the pastor said, "Do you believe I
[1:08:48] can cross on the other side
[1:08:52] although it's
[1:08:54] there's a strong uh rushing water?"
[1:08:58] And he said, "Yes, pastor. I believe
[1:09:00] you. You can do that."
[1:09:03] Okay. So, you see that little lag down
[1:09:06] there at the co at the side of the
[1:09:08] river? Yeah. You know, I can take that
[1:09:10] and you know, I can stand on top, sit on
[1:09:14] top of it and still cross on the other
[1:09:16] side.
[1:09:19] The p the deacon said, "Oh, sure you can
[1:09:22] do that."
[1:09:24] Amen. And you see that wheelbarrow? He
[1:09:26] said, "Now," he said, I said, "I can
[1:09:28] pack a log and wheel a wheelbarrow
[1:09:30] across at the same time." Sure, pastor.
[1:09:33] The Lord is with you. Your faith can do
[1:09:36] anything. He said, "Now I can put you in
[1:09:40] the wheelbarrow
[1:09:43] and pack the lag." He said, "Now wait a
[1:09:47] minute."
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So that's why said
[1:09:55] it's different when you're included in
[1:09:58] it yourself.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; It's good when you're not part of it.
[1:10:02] You can do that. You can make it.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But when you need to be
[1:10:07] identified,
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; when you need to be part of it, when you
[1:10:12] should be included in it. See now that
[1:10:14] it's mighty good for us to say here,
[1:10:16] amen. It's mighty good for us to say, I
[1:10:18] believe that's true. But then put it in
[1:10:21] action. You got to put it in action.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Whatever we believe, whatever we
[1:10:30] express, we need to put it into action.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Now on the next part
[1:10:37] we see here
[1:10:39] that uh in verse three we go back in
[1:10:42] verse three. Let's read in verse three.
[1:10:46] Now this is presenting now their claim.
[1:10:48] He said, "Our father
[1:10:51] died in the wilderness,
[1:10:54] and he was not in the company of them
[1:10:57] that gathered themselves together
[1:11:00] against the Lord in the company of Kora,
[1:11:03] but died in his own sin and had no
[1:11:05] sons."
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. What was the basis of their claim?
[1:11:13] The basis of their claim
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; that put them in their rightful position
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; was on the basis
[1:11:24] of the principle that their father
[1:11:27] remained faithful to Moses the prophet.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Our fathers have our father have
[1:11:41] no sons but we know amen we have a p we
[1:11:45] should have a portion on the
[1:11:47] inheritance.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what is their basis? What is
[1:11:52] their support?
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they said our father died in
[1:11:57] the wilderness and he was not in the
[1:11:59] company of them that gathered themselves
[1:12:01] together against the lord in the company
[1:12:04] of kora.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So remember these these
[1:12:08] individuals mentioned by these women
[1:12:11] daughters of Zilopiad. Amen. Were
[1:12:13] individuals who stood against Moses.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; But because their father Zilopihad
[1:12:23] did not join them.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Zilopiad was not a rebel against Moses.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; He stood with him no matter what. Yeah.
[1:12:35] Amen.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; There were many many complaints against
[1:12:39] Moses and this uh uh uh uh uh group of
[1:12:42] Kora. Amen. They they stood against
[1:12:44] Moses and they were trying to circle
[1:12:47] around and convince so forth and so on.
[1:12:50] But Cilopia did not join them.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he knew what's what what
[1:12:58] was going on. Amen. But Zilope had stood
[1:13:02] and because of his faithfulness I would
[1:13:05] say loyalty.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; You know our loyalty is not vested upon
[1:13:12] men
[1:13:14] but because Moses was a vindicated
[1:13:17] prophet of God.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our loyalty upon the vindicated
[1:13:21] man is our loyalty to God.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our respect to that person, our
[1:13:27] respect to that man is our also our
[1:13:29] respect and loyalty to God who pulled
[1:13:32] him and placed him. Hallelujah. So I
[1:13:35] believe that's why we have great respect
[1:13:37] for the messenger of this generation
[1:13:40] because the Bible says, Amen. He that
[1:13:42] receiveth the prophet in the name of the
[1:13:45] prophet shall receive the prophet's
[1:13:48] reward.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so now listen. Amen. If
[1:13:52] we uh uh if we stand on that ground,
[1:13:55] amen, it will not only us who will
[1:13:57] benefit but our children also.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Silopead was no longer on the scene.
[1:14:04] Amen. Only his daughters. Amen. And
[1:14:07] there were no one, no man
[1:14:10] standing
[1:14:12] for his daughters.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:16] But his daughters are well thought.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:21] and and and probably they could have
[1:14:24] seen how Zilopia had respected the
[1:14:26] prophet so much. Amen. And they have
[1:14:29] seen that and so that's why you know
[1:14:31] when when they know Amen. Now you know
[1:14:33] these are properties of our father.
[1:14:35] Amen. And and you know let's go we
[1:14:38] should go to court we should go where
[1:14:39] you know and let us let us uh appeal to
[1:14:42] some other families and probably they
[1:14:44] will they will help us present our our
[1:14:47] cause our issue so forth and so on. No,
[1:14:49] they did it themselves and approached
[1:14:52] Moses.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And because of that,
[1:14:58] they received Amen. They received the
[1:15:01] rightful response.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; So look in the next quote,
[1:15:08] he said here now in paragraph 165 in the
[1:15:12] message, respects. Now if you can't
[1:15:15] respect the man,
[1:15:17] respect the office he holds in God.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Not just the prophet, the pastor, the
[1:15:29] fifold ministry.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Vindicated by the Lord and his
[1:15:34] word. That's exactly right. See, respect
[1:15:37] him.
[1:15:38] If a minister comes up, your pastor
[1:15:41] always respect him. I've heard
[1:15:42] congregations talk about their pastor.
[1:15:44] How just talk about him, run him down,
[1:15:46] ridicule him. How is that pastor ever
[1:15:48] going to do anything for you? He can't
[1:15:50] do it.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; I don't say this church. Yeah. I don't
[1:15:55] say this church.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't say this church, but I
[1:16:01] mean churches I have seen.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Meaning that was a prevailing fact
[1:16:07] during the time of the prophet.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, you've got to love your
[1:16:13] pastor. And I believe you love your
[1:16:15] pastor.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can really feel it. And I that's
[1:16:19] that's something that uh uh uh uh good
[1:16:23] of you. Amen. Evening light f uh
[1:16:26] fellowship. You've got to know that's
[1:16:28] his human being.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; But yet God has made him
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; listen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; He
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; pastor.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Did you get that?
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; We pastors, we have our own weaknesses.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; That's true. That's a fact.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; We cannot deny it.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. But listen,
[1:16:53] I like this. The whole He said, you've
[1:16:55] got to know that he's human being, but
[1:16:57] yet God has made him his.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Not ours.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; His
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; pastor.
[1:17:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; He's not placed there
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; just for something.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; He's pastor.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; God's chosen pastor.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; God's chosen ministry. The Holy Ghost
[1:17:24] has made him overseer. Then you've got
[1:17:27] to respect him in that manner.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; And no matter what the pastor's done, if
[1:17:31] you'd respect him in your heart as God's
[1:17:33] servant, God will respect you for doing
[1:17:36] it. That's right.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; So, that's how we respect the five-fold
[1:17:44] ministry. Of course, our pastor, the
[1:17:46] prophet of this generation in the
[1:17:48] five-fold ministry, because it's not
[1:17:50] it's not the man. Amen. It's the
[1:17:52] anointing in the man.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; It's the calling in the man.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Because that made him his pipled
[1:18:00] ministry, not just the pastor. His.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; That's his. Very good.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; And if God claims
[1:18:08] the minister to be his,
[1:18:11] we're responsible to recognize that.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; And God will bless us in doing so.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, and of course, this is this
[1:18:21] example is also not new to you. I you
[1:18:24] know, uh during the time of during the
[1:18:26] time of Elisha, you know, in in second
[1:18:30] Kings, let me read that. So, the waters
[1:18:31] were healed. 2 Kings chapter 2 22. So
[1:18:35] the waters were healed unto this day
[1:18:37] according to the saying of Elisha which
[1:18:39] you spake. And he went up from tents
[1:18:41] unto Bethl. And as he was going up by
[1:18:43] the way, there came forth little
[1:18:45] children out of the city and mocked him
[1:18:50] and said unto him, Go up, thou baldhead.
[1:18:53] Go up, thou baldhead. And he turned back
[1:18:55] and looked on them and cursed them in
[1:18:57] the name of the Lord. And there came for
[1:19:00] two shebers out of the wood and tear 40
[1:19:05] and2 children of them. Now listen, these
[1:19:09] are innocent children.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know the prophet of this
[1:19:16] generation spoke. Although he mentioned
[1:19:18] Elijah, we know that it was Elisha. He
[1:19:20] said he was baldheaded and he was coming
[1:19:22] down the road and some little children
[1:19:25] begin to say old baldheaded old
[1:19:27] baldheaded why don't you go up like
[1:19:29] Elijah did making fun of him now what
[1:19:32] was all right them little kids they
[1:19:35] didn't maybe it was their parents
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; that taught them to do that
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; they were little fellows
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; you know but said you know it's no
[1:19:48] longer you know Yeah, we have h a
[1:19:51] children delinquency, but now it's not
[1:19:54] just children delinquency, but we have
[1:19:56] parent delinquency.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; And the prophet moved further than that.
[1:20:08] Not just children parent delinquency,
[1:20:11] but also pulpit delinquency.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Praise.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ministers stand behind the pullpit
[1:20:19] and yet they don't respect the word.
[1:20:22] Hallelujah. They can sing, they can
[1:20:24] worship, they can invite the presence of
[1:20:26] the Lord as if you're you're singing,
[1:20:28] you're worshiping along with the angels
[1:20:30] of heaven coming down to worship with
[1:20:33] you. Amen. You can see how they worship
[1:20:36] even in the denomination. They could
[1:20:38] they could pull down the presence of the
[1:20:40] Lord right there in their midst because
[1:20:43] you know, Amen. The the the prophet of
[1:20:45] God said when we invite him he will
[1:20:47] come.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. One time in the Bible Simon
[1:20:50] invited him.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Right. He came.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; But then we we we found out that he was
[1:20:59] invited there but he was not welcome.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. What do you call that? That's
[1:21:04] delinquency.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's home delinquency. You
[1:21:08] invite the Lord and then he's not
[1:21:10] welcome. He's just right there in one
[1:21:12] corner. not even uh uh uh uh paying
[1:21:15] attention to him, not even giving him
[1:21:17] water to wash his feet. Amen. Or if
[1:21:20] Simon was rich, he can he can assign he
[1:21:23] can pay somebody to do it for him.
[1:21:25] Hallelujah. No respect at all.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the same thing with many
[1:21:30] churches today. Amen. That way they they
[1:21:33] can really invite the presence of the
[1:21:36] Lord. They can enjoy, they can jump,
[1:21:38] they run and everything. Amen. But you
[1:21:40] know but when somebody stand behind the
[1:21:42] wolf he just say oh we don't need to
[1:21:46] preach the word anymore
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; that worship is enough and the pastor
[1:21:52] will just preach you will just say
[1:21:54] something 5 10 minutes after worshiping
[1:21:56] one and a half hours
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; no respect
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; hallelujah worship is just cultivating
[1:22:03] the soil preparing the soil but unless
[1:22:06] you drop the seed
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; there's nothing that will come out of
[1:22:10] that.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So it's the same thing.
[1:22:13] That's why Amen. We we we we we now we
[1:22:16] we just feel the atmosphere when we
[1:22:18] worship, when we offer song with the
[1:22:20] Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. Our hearts are
[1:22:22] being prepared. Hallelujah. Longing for
[1:22:25] something. Hallelujah. But we need the
[1:22:28] seed to be dropped on.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; We need the word. We need the message of
[1:22:32] the hour because the word will place us
[1:22:35] to our rightful position. Hallelujah. to
[1:22:38] our rightful attitude. It will produce
[1:22:40] right character. In that manner, we can
[1:22:43] claim
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; our possession.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; We can claim our inheritance.
[1:22:49] Inheritance is just right there.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we need to approach it
[1:22:55] in the right manner.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see now Hallelujah. So you
[1:23:01] see now he said they were making fun of
[1:23:03] his prophet but they got him angry and
[1:23:05] he turned around and put a curse on them
[1:23:06] children in the name of the Lord and two
[1:23:09] shevers come out of the woods and killed
[1:23:12] 42 little innocent children.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because probably during
[1:23:18] breakfast, during lunch, during dinner,
[1:23:21] Amen. they talk about the ministers and
[1:23:24] so forth and so on. and children.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They make light of the
[1:23:33] ministry.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; And then you go on the next generation
[1:23:37] after generation. Look what we have
[1:23:39] right now in this generation. But thank
[1:23:41] God the message believers, we've got so
[1:23:44] much respect for the ministry. We've got
[1:23:47] respect for his word.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That's why here you
[1:23:52] know you can you can only in the message
[1:23:54] I can see even even in the Philippines
[1:23:56] you know even our young people
[1:23:58] hallelujah amen you know you preach one
[1:24:01] hour preach one hour and a half they
[1:24:03] have so much respect they can just sit
[1:24:06] down there and responding to the word
[1:24:08] hallelujah why because they are being
[1:24:10] well thought
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; hallelujah thank you Lord
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; and now that don't sound the nature of
[1:24:18] the holy spirit does it no kill them
[1:24:20] little children, but he angered a
[1:24:23] prophet.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; He cursed them. Children had to be
[1:24:26] recognized because he was a prophet. So
[1:24:30] you have to watch.
[1:24:32] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:24:35] Now let's go on a bigger picture. So you
[1:24:38] see here from the home, the pullpit.
[1:24:41] Amen. So you see as as uh as we had made
[1:24:45] mention
[1:24:47] God's servants
[1:24:49] are human beings.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Now I like that portion that says here
[1:24:57] even the prophet of God when I first
[1:25:00] read that and heard you know the prophet
[1:25:04] trying to commit suicide. Oh that shook
[1:25:06] me honestly.
[1:25:09] Amen.
[1:25:12] But in the message from that time on,
[1:25:14] brother B say I was just about to I had
[1:25:15] the pistol in my hand a few minutes
[1:25:18] before it snap it all the way around
[1:25:22] trying to commit suicide
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; because of so much pressure.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Even the prophet of this generation
[1:25:34] express expounded by the Lord that he
[1:25:37] remains a human being. Amen.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; With so much
[1:25:44] stress,
[1:25:45] so much pressure,
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; he went into that lowest level.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; And he tried and he said the same day I
[1:25:59] tried to lay my hand on the 33,000 volt
[1:26:03] line when I was working as an
[1:26:05] electrician. You know my story. And the
[1:26:08] first thing I know, I was on the ground
[1:26:11] sitting there sweating, not knowing what
[1:26:14] had happened. That meant God reserving
[1:26:17] this ministry for you people.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; I'd have went right then.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; So God had preserved the man.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. Oh yeah.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Oh I remember one time uh uh uh yeah it
[1:26:35] was I think it was brother Amos who
[1:26:37] messaged me that brother Ron was just
[1:26:39] walking and he just felt something and
[1:26:41] just you know and he was rushed to the
[1:26:43] hospital because of something that have
[1:26:45] happened. Something might have happened
[1:26:48] but the Lord preserved the man.
[1:26:52] God reserving this ministry for you
[1:26:55] people
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; because we believe that unless we are
[1:27:00] finished with our ministry
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; there's nothing Satan can do.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. He can just try us. He can just
[1:27:08] put us in one corner and pressure us.
[1:27:11] Amen. But unless we are finished,
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; God will preserve
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; God will preserve the man. Hallelujah.
[1:27:22] Now, so much on Moses, but let's now go
[1:27:25] back to the uh uh to the children to the
[1:27:29] daughters of Zilopiad and let's move
[1:27:32] forward and let's see in verse six.
[1:27:35] Amen.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; I believe this is the
[1:27:39] main focus of my preaching this morning.
[1:27:44] In verse six, and the Lord spake unto
[1:27:46] Moses, saying,
[1:27:51] the Lord uh the daughters of Celopiad,
[1:27:54] listen, speak right.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:03] So who told that? The Lord.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses had no reference. But now
[1:28:12] it's the Lord speaking back to him.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; He prayed about it.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Never rejected it because it did
[1:28:19] not happen before.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he said, "Can you give me a
[1:28:24] little time?
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Let me pray about it and let me just
[1:28:26] present it to the Lord and let's just
[1:28:29] wait." Because waiting is a virtue.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you know how to wait in the
[1:28:37] right time, God will answer.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; And so that's why in verse 16, and the
[1:28:42] Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
[1:28:44] hallelujah, the daughters of Zilopiad
[1:28:47] speak right.
[1:28:51] It is God who recognized the claim of
[1:28:56] the daughters. They are right.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, we have. You have no reference.
[1:29:02] Yes, it did not happen before. Yes, it's
[1:29:05] not in the book,
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; but they speak right.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Because they know their position.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; They know their inheritance. They know
[1:29:17] how to claim it. They know where to go.
[1:29:20] They know who to go.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; And so, it's God vindicating vindicating
[1:29:28] this this these daughters. Why? It's
[1:29:30] it's a good thing to hear. Hallelujah.
[1:29:33] That it's not any man who's vindicating
[1:29:35] our claim, but it's God from heaven. You
[1:29:38] are right. You speak right. You claim
[1:29:41] right.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said, "The daughters
[1:29:45] of Cilopia speak right. Thou shalt
[1:29:48] surely give them a possession of an
[1:29:52] inheritance among their father's
[1:29:55] brethren. and thou shalt cause the
[1:29:57] inheritance of their father to pass unto
[1:30:00] them.
[1:30:02] It never happened before for the very
[1:30:05] first time now because there are five
[1:30:08] women who know who they were.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; They knew their father was not a rebel.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; He did not join among the company of
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Kora.
[1:30:23] Yeah.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; That was only the backup, the support
[1:30:28] that they had.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And it is all coming
[1:30:34] from the mouth of the Lord.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Speaking to Moses, the daughters of
[1:30:39] Zilopia speak right. Thou shalt surely
[1:30:41] give them a possession of an inheritance
[1:30:44] among their brothers, brethren, and thou
[1:30:46] shalt cause the inheritance of their
[1:30:48] father to pass unto them. Hallelujah.
[1:30:52] Amen. So you see, you remember sister
[1:30:56] hate, right?
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Bannon was testifying and
[1:31:00] perhaps there were there were men around
[1:31:02] that you know they're they're just
[1:31:04] listening, you know, nodding their heads
[1:31:06] like that. Amen. But there is a woman,
[1:31:09] Amen. There is a little old quiet sister
[1:31:12] sitting back there, a little dash bonnet
[1:31:14] on like the country women wear there.
[1:31:16] And she put a little clean bless to come
[1:31:18] over to help her mother cook me a
[1:31:20] dinner. And she was sitting with her
[1:31:21] hand like this and she said, "That's
[1:31:24] nothing but the truth."
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; That's nothing but the truth.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; She said the right thing.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; She said the right thing. He said,
[1:31:37] "Here's my Bible." And as a servant of
[1:31:40] God, I say this. I could hear hardly
[1:31:43] hear the last she said. Her mother was
[1:31:46] trying to say something, but I didn't
[1:31:47] get it. Just as she said, she said the
[1:31:50] right thing. The spirit of the Lord said
[1:31:52] to me, tell her,
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; tell her,
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; tell her to ask what she will
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; and you give it to her.
[1:32:03] Amen. It's the same thing, same pattern.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because the woman, sister
[1:32:09] hat, right? Hallelujah. She said the
[1:32:11] right thing.
[1:32:15] Amen.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; While others might have doubted
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; the testimony of the prophet, but here
[1:32:22] comes an old poor woman. Hallelujah.
[1:32:26] Amen. Who had nothing,
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; but she said the right thing.
[1:32:31] Hallelujah. Here's my Bible. And as a
[1:32:33] servant of God, I say this. I could
[1:32:35] hardly hear the last she said. Her
[1:32:37] mother was trying to say something, but
[1:32:38] I didn't get it. Just as she said, she
[1:32:41] said the writing of the spirit of the
[1:32:42] Lord said to me, tell her to ask what
[1:32:46] she will and you give it to her. Moses,
[1:32:49] give the daughters of Zilopiad
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; what they are claiming for.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Because they said the right thing.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just don't know how far it can
[1:33:06] go when we say the right thing.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And said I couldn't speak that
[1:33:12] room everybody felt strain. I said
[1:33:14] sister she said yes brother Brennham
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; I said thus saith the Lord
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; speak anything that you desire.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; I don't care what it is. If you want to
[1:33:27] know what God has given this ministry
[1:33:30] speak anything that you desire.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe there's there's
[1:33:36] Haiti here. Amen.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; The bride is here.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You speak anything that you
[1:33:46] desire. I don't care what it is. If you
[1:33:48] want to know that God has given this
[1:33:50] ministry, speak anything that you
[1:33:52] desire. Thus say the Lord. If you'll
[1:33:55] speak it, I'll speak it behind you and
[1:33:57] you'll have it right here.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Right here.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Eight people standing there
[1:34:04] looking. She said, "Brother Brennham,
[1:34:06] what shall I say?"
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; So innocent,
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; just saying the right thing. And I said,
[1:34:14] I said, "It's up to you.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Up to you.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; It's up to you."
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham gave him gave her
[1:34:23] options.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; And here are the options.
[1:34:29] There set her crippled sister, her aged
[1:34:32] father. She was poor. She could ask for
[1:34:35] money.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; She could have asked for anything she
[1:34:38] wanted to.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; I said, "Ask anything that's in your
[1:34:42] heart."
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Anything that you want to, you ask it.
[1:34:46] And thus, say the Lord, I'll speak it
[1:34:50] behind you and you'll have it.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Two options.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Money or healing.
[1:35:01] But you know a woman
[1:35:06] a a woman is the bride
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; but the bride
[1:35:10] who is in her rightful position
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; who has the character
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; knows what is more valuable.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I I'm not saying
[1:35:26] brother Brandham was giving him giving
[1:35:28] her a wrong option. Hallelujah. That's
[1:35:31] not it. But I believe at that very
[1:35:34] moment, Sister Haiti, right, was in the
[1:35:36] rightful position and she knew what was
[1:35:39] more valuable.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Something that is not only
[1:35:44] tangible, but something that is eternal.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If we know what to ask from
[1:35:50] the Lord, we know what is valuable.
[1:35:54] Not something that is temporal but
[1:35:56] something that is eternal.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then Hallelujah. And
[1:36:01] then and she said the salvation of my
[1:36:05] two boys.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said I said you have it
[1:36:11] in the name of the Lord.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Others might be questioning. Amen.
[1:36:19] Hallelujah. About those two boys. But
[1:36:21] then and again just like the daughters
[1:36:23] of Zilopia had that it did not happen
[1:36:26] before.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Never in the history of men.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Never in the history of
[1:36:33] salvation. Brothers and sisters only by
[1:36:36] this occasion. Hallelujah. That the
[1:36:39] basis of the salvation was not after the
[1:36:43] conversion of those two souls but after
[1:36:46] the claim of their mother. Hallelujah.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; I believe God is absolute.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; I believe God is absolute.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; I cannot question that
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; because it is thus saith the Lord.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; And I believe the prophet and he that
[1:37:07] receiveth the prophet in the name of the
[1:37:09] prophet shall receive the prophet's
[1:37:11] reward.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. Amen. Come on, bride.
[1:37:17] Speak.
[1:37:18] speak the right thing. Hallelujah. And
[1:37:21] those two little modern teenage nickel
[1:37:23] preach boys that had hated the very
[1:37:25] cause of Christ grabbed one another and
[1:37:27] begin to scream. And the blessings of
[1:37:29] God, the power of God struck the place.
[1:37:31] Bangs fell into this plate. I don't know
[1:37:33] what happened for about 10 minutes.
[1:37:36] Friend, do you realize what that was?
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; I have never in all my life.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; It never happened before.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Word.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; You might have something to pray.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; You might have a claim.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; That you have not experienced before.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, speak the right
[1:38:01] thing.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; And speak something that is more
[1:38:04] valuable.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; God is here.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; I have never in all my life have felt
[1:38:10] such anointing. The first time I was
[1:38:12] ever perform on a human being, it
[1:38:15] bypassed aristocrats. It bypassed
[1:38:18] everything else and went to a poor
[1:38:20] little old widow woman living up on the
[1:38:21] hill there. God knew what she would ask.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; God knew what she would ask. Her two
[1:38:29] boys were gloriously saved the very
[1:38:32] minute it was spoken. If she would have
[1:38:35] asked for $10,000, it would have been
[1:38:37] given to her.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Thus said the Lord. If she would have
[1:38:42] asked for her sister's healing, it would
[1:38:44] have been given to her. Anything she
[1:38:46] would have asked, it would have been
[1:38:48] given to her.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; And now listen, this is for you. This is
[1:38:53] for us.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now listen, what's the next verse?
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; I believe
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; that the church of the living God
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. If the brother can help me, I want
[1:39:07] everybody to to to read this. Amen. I
[1:39:10] believe that the church of the living
[1:39:13] God
[1:39:14] is moving into a spear now
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; that's going to shake the whole world.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; I believe that the church of the living
[1:39:26] God is moving into a spear now that's
[1:39:29] going to shake the whole world. That's
[1:39:31] the first time
[1:39:33] it's been since the days of Jesus of
[1:39:35] Nazareth to a human being. Ask anything
[1:39:38] that you will and it shall be given unto
[1:39:40] you anything you desire. Don't you see
[1:39:43] the words of Jesus Christ being
[1:39:45] fulfilled?
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; We are entering into that spear
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; now.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Into that real now.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; I believe this message is continuously
[1:39:59] unfolding itself.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. for us to be able to
[1:40:06] comprehend.
[1:40:08] Hallelujah.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; What's in this word, what's in this
[1:40:12] message of the hour.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's hard for us to faith
[1:40:16] them.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; But this is real.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; God is real in our midst.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're entering now. We have
[1:40:30] entered actually now into that sphere
[1:40:32] where everything is possible.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; True, brother.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now moving on on numbers
[1:40:44] chapter 36:E2.
[1:40:46] Amen. Numbers 36:2
[1:40:53] or before. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:41:01] And they said, "The Lord commanded my
[1:41:03] Lord to give the land of an inheritance
[1:41:05] by lot to the children of Israel Israel.
[1:41:08] And my Lord was commanded by the Lord to
[1:41:10] give the inheritance of Cilopad, our
[1:41:13] brother unto his daughters."
[1:41:16] Amen. So in chapter 36 of Numbers, it
[1:41:21] was again mentioned and declared. All
[1:41:24] right. Now, let's go back to Numbers
[1:41:26] chapter 27 and we're going to see
[1:41:29] something here. Amen. In verse 8,
[1:41:32] Numbers 27
[1:41:34] verse 8.
[1:41:38] Oh, I like this. You like the word of
[1:41:39] God?
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Now, it first time it
[1:41:44] happened.
[1:41:45] Hallelujah. Now in verse 8 of Numbers
[1:41:49] chapter 27, it says here, "And thou
[1:41:52] shalt speak unto the children of Israel,
[1:41:55] saying,
[1:41:57] "If a man die and have no son,
[1:42:02] then ye shall cause his inheritance to
[1:42:05] pass unto his daughter. And if he has no
[1:42:09] daughter, then ye shall give his
[1:42:10] inheritance unto his brethren." Did you
[1:42:13] see something here? Yes,
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; it never happened before.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; No record on file.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; But yet because of the five daughters of
[1:42:23] Zilopiad saying the writing, claiming
[1:42:26] the writing, knowing what's valuable.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now God made a declaration.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Now it is not put on record,
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; but let it be recorded from this time on
[1:42:41] Moses.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let it be. Amen. And he said,
[1:42:48] "Now, Amen. He speak unto the children
[1:42:51] of Israel, saying, if a man die and have
[1:42:53] no son, then ye shall cause his
[1:42:56] inheritance to pass unto his daughter."
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; The game is changed.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God who was absolute was
[1:43:10] being convinced
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; by the position of these women.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; I wonder this morning. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:43:22] I believe that I'm facing today. Amen.
[1:43:25] The bride of the Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:43:28] knows
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; What it is?
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; And what she is standing for. Amen.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now
[1:43:39] maybe last few more coach here. No. Yes,
[1:43:42] sir. The church
[1:43:45] now we're moving into that spirit now in
[1:43:47] the church age book. Listen. Yes, sir.
[1:43:50] The church is no longer the mouthpiece
[1:43:53] of God.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; It is
[1:43:59] its own mouthpiece.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:05] Did you see the situation the prophet is
[1:44:07] here
[1:44:10] right say whatever you desire in your
[1:44:14] heart
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; and sister hat said brother Brandham I
[1:44:18] don't know what to say can you say it
[1:44:20] for me
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; because she had so much confidence on
[1:44:24] the prophet
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; but the prophet recognized the word the
[1:44:29] voice of God
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; and said no that's not the instruction
[1:44:33] instruction.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; The instruction was say what that woman
[1:44:38] desires.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; And Bel gave her an option.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; So say whatever you wish.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So listen here. Now the church is
[1:44:50] no longer the mouthpiece of God. It is
[1:44:52] its own mouthpiece.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; So God is turning on her.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet basically is no longer
[1:45:02] on the scene.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we have the message of
[1:45:06] the hour.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you know your rightful
[1:45:10] position.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So God the pro the Bible of
[1:45:14] God is turning on her from the prophet
[1:45:18] to the bride.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not me. Sister hate. Right. You
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; have to speak. Right.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; God is turning on her. God from the
[1:45:30] prophet is turning on to the bride.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, bride.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is turning on you. God
[1:45:38] is turning on us.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; To speak.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; No longer the mouthpiece of God. You but
[1:45:45] you are the bride is her own mouthpiece.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; He will confound her through the prophet
[1:45:53] and the bride. For the voice of God will
[1:45:55] be in her.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. For it says in the last
[1:46:00] chapter of Revelation verse 17, the
[1:46:02] spirit and the bride say come and once
[1:46:04] more the world will hear direct from God
[1:46:06] as a Pentecost. But of course that word
[1:46:08] bride will be repugated as in the first
[1:46:12] age.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. God is turning on her.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is standing on the bride.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; The word, the voice is in her.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; To have confidence.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So that's why God has
[1:46:37] given us all this inheritance.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:46:43] so you see, we have mentioned Rahab. We
[1:46:46] have mentioned, you know, uh but I'm
[1:46:48] going to to read uh in John 11:1. Now a
[1:46:52] certain man was sick named Lazarus of
[1:46:53] Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister
[1:46:55] Martha. It was that Mary which anointed
[1:46:58] the Lord with ointment and wiped his
[1:47:01] feet with her hair, whose brother
[1:47:03] Lazarus was sick. Therefore his sister
[1:47:05] sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he
[1:47:07] whom thou lovest is sick. When Jesus
[1:47:10] heard that, he said, "This sickness is
[1:47:11] not unto death, but for the glory of
[1:47:13] God, that the Son of God might be
[1:47:15] glorified thereby." Now Jesus loved
[1:47:18] Martha and her sister and Lazarus. Now I
[1:47:21] made mention this because you know at
[1:47:24] one occasion Mary and Martha Jesus was
[1:47:28] there and Jesus reminded Martha Martha
[1:47:34] you're thinking so much
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; you're making yourself so busy.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; But you see you're doing good
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; but you're complaining.
[1:47:48] Yeah. You're you're serving God's people
[1:47:50] while I'm preaching here. Amen. You're
[1:47:52] preparing food. You're preparing all
[1:47:54] these things that so that after the
[1:47:56] fellowship, we have something to eat.
[1:47:58] That's good.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. But what made it bad is you're
[1:48:02] complaining.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; When we do something for God, don't
[1:48:06] complain.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Do it as unto the Lord and let his his
[1:48:10] name be glorified.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But look at Mary. He had chosen
[1:48:14] the best part.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And also not only that, this this
[1:48:19] part of the scripture reminded Mary who
[1:48:22] anointed the Lord with ointment and wipe
[1:48:24] his feet with her hair. Amen. But
[1:48:27] listen, what I'm after this this part of
[1:48:29] the scripture is that God never forgets.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; And we cannot outdo God.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; We cannot even outgive him.
[1:48:42] And whatever we do, no matter how
[1:48:45] little, how how big it is, it is
[1:48:48] recorded in the mind of God. Maybe other
[1:48:51] people won't see it, but nothing will
[1:48:54] escape from the sight of the Lord. It's
[1:48:56] all recorded. And from a certain period
[1:48:59] of time, God knows how to repay.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; And what happened? What have they
[1:49:12] witnessed? The resurrection of their
[1:49:14] brother.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; The resurrection of their brother.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Now, I'm closing
[1:49:25] in.
[1:49:27] Now, in numbers 27, let's go back in
[1:49:29] verse one. It says, "Then came the
[1:49:32] daughters of Zilopead,
[1:49:35] the son of Happer,
[1:49:37] which means well, the youngest son of
[1:49:39] Gilead, Makir
[1:49:42] and Manasse, and Joseph." This the
[1:49:44] lineage of Zilopiad from Zilopiad. He
[1:49:47] said, "Callopiad, the son of Heer, son
[1:49:50] of Gilead, Amen, the son of Makir, son
[1:49:53] of Manasse, and son of Joseph."
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; So that's the lineage of Cilopad.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:50:00] So now Joseph,
[1:50:03] if we look at Joseph and we can find
[1:50:06] that in Genesis chapter 48, but we might
[1:50:09] not be we don't need to read that. You
[1:50:11] can read that back home and review it.
[1:50:13] I'm I'm going to read a portion of the
[1:50:15] quote. Now here in Genesis 48, Israel,
[1:50:18] Jacob was very old and his eyes were
[1:50:21] dim.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like the same thing, we are
[1:50:25] already in the last age and it looks
[1:50:28] like the light is dim to others.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. But not to the bride.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So those who are reading this part
[1:50:37] of the scripture, you know that in
[1:50:39] Genesis chapter 48, because Israel was
[1:50:42] so old, Joseph brought his two sons,
[1:50:45] Ephraim and Manasseh.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; And Ephraim by principle was older than
[1:50:51] Manasse. And it's a custom that that the
[1:50:56] elder gets the blessing.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Gets the inheritance.
[1:51:03] And again
[1:51:05] it happened at this point of time. So
[1:51:09] now Joseph knowing the tradition
[1:51:12] probably knowing what have transpired
[1:51:15] for long long ages before. Amen. So he
[1:51:19] knew that his father will put the
[1:51:21] blessing to the elder. So here is
[1:51:25] Israel. In his right hand he placed
[1:51:29] Ephraim. Amen. And then on his left he
[1:51:32] placed Manasse.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; All right. So now when Israel was about
[1:51:38] to pray,
[1:51:40] he crossed his hand.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; He crossed his hand. Yeah.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; And Joseph wanted to correct the
[1:51:48] prophet.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; But you cannot do that.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he said, "Father,
[1:51:57] that's not it. This is Ephraim. He's
[1:52:01] already on your right side and on your
[1:52:04] left is Manasse."
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Israel said, "I know what I'm
[1:52:09] doing."
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know what I'm doing. And brother
[1:52:13] Brandham said, "God has crossed my
[1:52:16] hand." He said, "God has crossed my
[1:52:18] hand. It's not me. God has crossed my
[1:52:21] hand because God has chosen that the
[1:52:24] younger shall receive the blessing."
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Now let's go to the
[1:52:33] conclusion. Now, now the Cilopia now
[1:52:35] listen the meaning of the names of the
[1:52:38] five daughters of Zilopia in regard to
[1:52:40] the names of the daughters scholars
[1:52:41] largely in agreement. Mahala means
[1:52:44] forgiven.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Mala means forgiven.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; And it's even placed in its rightful
[1:52:53] order.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; You know, because before you go into
[1:52:58] service, you must be forgiven first.
[1:53:01] Amen.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; But aren't you glad we're not just
[1:53:03] forgiven, we're being justified.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; More than just being forgiven. So mala
[1:53:10] means forgiven. But mala today means
[1:53:12] justified.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what have you felt after
[1:53:16] you were you felt you're being
[1:53:18] justified. Oh, hallelujah. You are being
[1:53:21] revived. You are being you've been
[1:53:22] rejoicing.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; There's a revival
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; in your heart.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's why the name Amen.
[1:53:31] Mala means forgiven, justified. Noah
[1:53:34] means movement. And movement is like a
[1:53:37] revival.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; It's placed there.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Not the Noah the pro but is the daughter
[1:53:47] of Zilopiad named Noah. Amen. His her
[1:53:50] name means a revival.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; So after being justified there is a
[1:53:55] revival.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then next, Amen. The name Mila
[1:54:03] means queen.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Milka means queen.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; To him that overcome will I give to sit
[1:54:14] with me in my throne.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Where is the bride sitting? Beside
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Ruth, Esther.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And because you are the bride,
[1:54:28] tearsa means pleasing,
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; an apple of the eye,
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; favorite.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; And lastly, amen. Hogla means worship.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:46] Amen. So all these characteristics are
[1:54:50] being combined. Hallelujah. and being uh
[1:54:53] uh being absorbed by the bride of this
[1:54:56] age today. Hallelujah. We feel we're
[1:54:59] being justified as if we have not done
[1:55:01] it in the first place. God had thrown it
[1:55:03] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why there is an
[1:55:08] in an inner revival because of the word
[1:55:11] and we know our position will be sitting
[1:55:14] with her in his in in him in his throne.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. and thus give us a
[1:55:20] reason to worship.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what is our rightful
[1:55:27] inheritance?
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brennan, when he was
[1:55:32] beyond the curtain of time, I'll just
[1:55:35] going to close my notes. So I just leave
[1:55:39] it just right there. I know our pastor
[1:55:42] can give a further conclusion on this.
[1:55:46] But you know when brother Brandham was
[1:55:48] beyond placing beyond the curtain of
[1:55:50] time you know you know there was a voice
[1:55:54] and and he saw a lot of people and said
[1:55:55] are all these panels we're not that many
[1:55:59] and know they are your converts.
[1:56:01] Amen. But you see up here now I just
[1:56:05] remember this one because as I flew here
[1:56:09] my uh uh uh my kids they had dogs
[1:56:14] and they're quite old. They had three
[1:56:16] poodles and one of them uh just had uh a
[1:56:21] surgery
[1:56:23] and my youngest daughter Faith just
[1:56:25] finished her veterinary medicine and uh
[1:56:29] preparing for her examination. But
[1:56:31] anyway, now one one of the the poodles
[1:56:34] and
[1:56:36] that's her favorite
[1:56:38] got sick had the surgery they spend a
[1:56:40] little because they wanted to extend and
[1:56:43] then just few days when I came here.
[1:56:45] Amen. My my daughter prayed you know and
[1:56:48] I I I knew I felt being a father she was
[1:56:51] crying because I know how she loved it.
[1:56:54] Amen. That's why I want to close with
[1:56:55] this. And so when when uh uh uh brother
[1:57:00] Benham heard the voice and he said at
[1:57:03] one point in time, you know, he remember
[1:57:06] uh his dog Fritz and his horde horse
[1:57:11] prince and even his rocking chair. Amen.
[1:57:16] And and he said when when when they were
[1:57:18] in that condition, Amen. Brother Banam
[1:57:21] said, you know, I know there's a place
[1:57:23] somehow that I'm go. I want to see you
[1:57:26] preach and prince. Amen. And so I copy
[1:57:30] and paste this portion and send it to my
[1:57:33] to my daughter. Amen. That when we go on
[1:57:36] the other side.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; All those
[1:57:44] who loved us
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; and those that we love.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; What are those creatures doing there?
[1:57:55] But see, they're part of our
[1:57:58] inheritance.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; And and and and and brother Benham said,
[1:58:04] "Will also Paul stand behind or uh in
[1:58:08] front of his people?" Yeah. He said,
[1:58:12] "Well, brother Benham said, I Paul I
[1:58:14] preach what Paul preached."
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; I have never deviated from it.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I never changed. I have
[1:58:23] never rebelled against the word
[1:58:27] of Paul.
[1:58:29] And we're resting on that.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; There's a resounding voice, a multitude
[1:58:37] of people, we're resting on that.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Those that whom you love and have loved
[1:58:46] you
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; will be there. They are yours.
[1:58:51] Amen.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; They're your inheritance.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. Thank you,
[1:59:02] brother. God bless you.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:21] Amen.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; I love Bible stories.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; I love looking into
[1:59:33] another portion I've not seen before.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Did you see something new?
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; I will
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; never read Numbers 27
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; the same again.
[1:59:51] because
[1:59:58] however you say his name
[2:00:01] or whatever it is
[2:00:04] because he did not rebel. He was not
[2:00:06] part of Kora.
[2:00:11] They had a right because they knew their
[2:00:13] father was rightfully taught.
[2:00:18] So they coming under that same thing. He
[2:00:21] taught us
[2:00:23] what he knew. He taught us.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; And
[2:00:28] this is amazing
[2:00:31] that they said we want our father's
[2:00:34] inheritance. Yes.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; never before
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; because it was always passed down
[2:00:42] through the sons
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; and through the elders.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; But God knows how to cross hands.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; God knows how to do things at the right
[2:00:55] time. And he cannot deny his own word.
[2:00:59] And they were a part of their father and
[2:01:02] their father had an inheritance. And
[2:01:04] because he was of the lineage of
[2:01:09] [Applause]
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; the inheritance coming down
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; through Joseph.
[2:01:17] [Music]
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I was so glad that because I
[2:01:23] said, "Lord, I know that the daughter's
[2:01:26] names mean something."
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; I thought when I get home, I'm going to
[2:01:31] study the names. And there he told me
[2:01:33] their names.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; And in their birth order,
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; what about your birth order?
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; How that you come, you're forgiven.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; You're justified as though you've never
[2:01:48] done it.
[2:01:53] [Music]
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; I like to be stirred. Amen.
[2:01:57] [Music]
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Noah means revival.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Mila means queen.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Knowing her position.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "Look, look at Esther and
[2:02:13] Ruth."
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Knowing their position. Where was it?
[2:02:17] Beside him.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; If I perish, I perish.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Never before in the history did you go
[2:02:26] before the king unless you were asked to
[2:02:29] come before him.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Here's another first time game changer.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Esther comes
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; with something on her heart and it's the
[2:02:45] salvation of her family.
[2:02:47] [Music]
[2:02:51] What do you want, Esther?
[2:02:53] [Music]
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Up to half of my kingdom.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; You begin to see these types and
[2:03:03] shadows.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; TZ means the apple of my eye, my
[2:03:08] favorite.
[2:03:10] I have not chosen you, my people,
[2:03:12] because you are the most in number, but
[2:03:14] I have chosen you because you are the
[2:03:16] fewest. I have elected you,
[2:03:17] predestinated you. You were in the mind
[2:03:20] of God. I conceived you before works
[2:03:24] were even done, before you were even
[2:03:26] born, before you went and lived your
[2:03:28] life. Before anything happened, I have
[2:03:32] already declared,
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; you're the apple of my eye.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; You're my favorite. Amen.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; The last one, Haggala.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Worship.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; My I I enjoyed that.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; I know you're not supposed to steal
[2:03:58] things. I'm going to steal that one.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I love to see the unfolding
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; of the word
[2:04:14] here. Five daughters. There was no son,
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; but they
[2:04:23] they knowing they've been taught, right?
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Well, what about my father's
[2:04:28] inheritance?
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; And I like to they went to the right
[2:04:32] channel.
[2:04:33] [Music]
[2:04:36] They go to God's provided way. They go
[2:04:38] they know the the the the approach to
[2:04:41] God.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; They knew God's dressear.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Are you catching it?
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; They knew if I if I go and I touch God's
[2:04:49] dressear
[2:04:51] per adventure. It's never been spoken
[2:04:53] before.
[2:04:54] This has never come to pass. But I want
[2:04:57] my inheritance. I don't care what it
[2:04:59] takes. I want what belongs to me.
[2:05:04] [Music]
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; How many of you say, "I want my father's
[2:05:13] inheritance."
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know I don't deserve it.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's not about me. It's about
[2:05:25] him.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Not about you. It's not. It's about the
[2:05:29] seed that lays within you. And God
[2:05:31] cannot deny himself.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:05:43] another piece of the puzzle just fell
[2:05:45] together
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; and my heart is blended even that much
[2:05:49] more closer to him. Father, I look and I
[2:05:53] see these five daughters come claiming
[2:05:56] their inheritance. And God said, and
[2:05:58] they speak, right?
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Imagine God, he didn't come down and
[2:06:02] give to them, speak to them in the night
[2:06:04] dreams and everything. No, he spoke to
[2:06:06] the prophet and the prophet spoke to
[2:06:08] them. God has heard your word and you
[2:06:10] spoke right.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; If you'll speak right, bride,
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; it's not you. When God comes down and
[2:06:19] and he anoints you,
[2:06:22] even though you're a human element, he
[2:06:24] said when the divine omnipotence of God
[2:06:28] comes down and reveals to you your
[2:06:31] inheritance, it's the same as
[2:06:34] omnipotence speaking.
[2:06:37] [Music]

[2:06:43] rising to another level. Come on.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "We've entered another sphere,
[2:06:48] another realm."
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Enoch
[2:06:52] was entering into another realm.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; The bride is entering now.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; This partial
[2:07:08] revelation is becoming full
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; revelation.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:07:38] you bind on earth,

[2:07:46] speaking.
[2:07:49] Amen. Brother Robert, here. Give me your
[2:07:51] hand. Let's agree together.
