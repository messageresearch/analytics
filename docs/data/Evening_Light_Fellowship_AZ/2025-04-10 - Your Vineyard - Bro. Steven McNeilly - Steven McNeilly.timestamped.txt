[0:00] [Music]
[0:48] Oh. Oh.
[1:00] [Music]
[1:35] to
[1:41] be. Hey
[1:45] [Music]
[3:15] [Music]
[3:21] [Music]
[4:20] Let's all stand this evening
[4:22] [Music]
[4:26] song. Let go and let God. There we go.
[4:29] His
[4:31] way. Go and let God have his way. From
[4:37] the top. Let's just sing that. Let go
[4:41] and let God have his
[4:46] wonderful way.
[4:48] Let go and let God have his
[4:56] way. Your sorrow will
[5:00] vanish. Your night turn
[5:05] today. Let go and let God have his way.
[5:11] Sing that again. Would you just let go
[5:13] this evening in worship? Let go and let
[5:17] God have his
[5:20] wonderful
[5:22] way. Let go and let God have his
[5:29] [Music]
[5:30] way. Your sorrow will
[5:35] vanish. Your light turn today.
[5:40] Let go and let God have his
[5:46] way.
[5:49] Amen. Amen. Sure am thankful that he's
[5:52] had us through it all.
[5:54] Amen. Let's start on verse
[5:57] one. I've had many tears and
[6:01] sorrows. I've had questions for
[6:05] tomorrow.
[6:07] There have been times I didn't know
[6:09] right from
[6:13] wrong. But in every
[6:16] [Music]
[6:17] situation, God gave blessed
[6:21] consolation that my trials only come to
[6:25] make me strong. Do you believe that this
[6:29] evening? Well, through it
[6:34] all, through it
[6:37] all, I've learned to trust in
[6:41] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[6:46] God. Through it
[6:50] all, through it
[6:54] all, I've learned to depend
[6:58] upon his word. Bring it
[7:01] up. Well, I've been to lots of
[7:05] places and I've seen a lot of
[7:10] faces. There have been times I felt so
[7:14] all alone.
[7:18] But in my lonely
[7:21] hours, those precious lonely
[7:26] hours, Jesus let me know I was his
[7:32] own. So we sing, "Through it all, can
[7:36] you lift your hand as that testimony?
[7:39] Through it
[7:41] all, I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[7:46] I've learned to trust in
[7:49] God. Oh, through it
[7:53] all. Oh, through it
[7:57] all, I learn to depend upon his word. I
[8:04] like this verse right here. Well, I
[8:07] thank God for the
[8:09] mountains and I thank him for the
[8:13] valleys and I thank him for the trials
[8:17] he's brought me
[8:21] through. For if I'd never had a problem,
[8:26] I wouldn't know that he could solve
[8:29] them. I'd never know what faith in God
[8:34] can do. Can you say amen to that? Oh,
[8:38] through it
[8:41] all. Through it
[8:45] all, I learned to trust in
[8:48] Jesus. I've learned to trust in
[8:52] God. Through it
[8:56] all, through it
[8:59] [Music]
[9:00] all, I learn to depend upon his
[9:07] word. Amen. That's truly our testimony
[9:11] this evening. Amen. Amen. We have quite
[9:14] a few prayer requests we'd like to read
[9:16] before we go to the Lord in prayer. Have
[9:19] a note from Brother Ruben Tamson. Please
[9:22] pray for Candace who is at home
[9:23] recovering from some dental
[9:25] work. We have a prayer request for
[9:27] Sister Li Lillian Vega. She was admitted
[9:30] to the hospital today due to a really
[9:33] hard time trying to breathe. So let's
[9:35] ask prayer for Sister Lillian this
[9:38] evening. Prayer requests for the
[9:40] Arasolas as they're headed to New York
[9:42] on
[9:44] Friday. Brother Brian Yesi is out
[9:46] homesick with a bad cough.
[9:49] Then we have a very urgent prayer
[9:51] request and also a praise report from
[9:53] Sister Becky tonight regarding Sister
[9:55] Lorie Snow. So she writes, "Thank you to
[9:58] all those who have been holding my
[9:59] sister-in-law Lorie Snow in prayer. She
[10:02] had an aortic tear/ dissection happen on
[10:05] Monday. She has had three major
[10:07] surgeries in 48 hours. this afternoon
[10:10] after surgery. This afternoon after
[10:13] surgery to put six stints in and remove
[10:15] blockage to kidneys. She is already
[10:17] showing good blood work that her kidneys
[10:19] are functioning again. The next 24 to 48
[10:22] hours remain critical for her. As the
[10:24] surgeon said, there is nothing else they
[10:26] can do. That is where God comes in. He
[10:29] is the healer. So, please continue to
[10:31] remember her in prayer in the days
[10:33] ahead. God bless. And he's been so
[10:36] merciful. So, let's just remember that
[10:38] urgent prayer request. Amen. Brother
[10:39] Mario, if you could come pray. Let's
[10:41] sing that third verse again. Amen. If we
[10:44] didn't have the mountain, we didn't have
[10:46] the valley, we wouldn't have that
[10:47] testimony. Amen. Well, I thank God for
[10:51] the
[10:52] mountains and I thank him for the
[10:56] valleys and I thank him for the trials
[11:00] he brought me through.
[11:04] For if I never had a problem, I wouldn't
[11:09] know that he could solve them. I'd never
[11:13] know a faith in God can do. That's the
[11:18] reason we sing. Through it
[11:23] all, through it
[11:27] all, I learned to trust in Jesus.
[11:31] I've learned to trust in
[11:35] God. Through it
[11:38] all, through it
[11:42] all, I learn to depend upon his word.
[11:50] Amen. Let's bow our heart.
[11:53] Loving gracious heavenly father, Lord,
[11:55] we so appreciate your love, Lord.
[12:00] Thank you Lord. And through it
[12:03] all your word always stand

[12:54] promises, Lord God. And even for the
[12:56] prayer requests tonight, we always
[12:59] believe, Lord, that you are the God that
[13:02] full of grace and mercy,
[13:04] Lord. You're still the God, Lord,
[13:07] that control all the circumstances in
[13:10] our lives. Lord might be sickness,

[13:15] trouble, depression, Lord, whatsoever,

[13:20] each needs Lord according to the grace
[13:23] and mercy in our lives, Lord. And once

[13:33] us, Lord God. And may you just anoint
[13:35] speaker tonight,
[13:37] Lord. And may you once again, Lord, pour
[13:40] out your blessing to each and every one
[13:42] of us,
[13:43] Lord. And may you just continually
[13:46] continually be with each and every one
[13:48] of us in order to worship, Lord God. And
[13:52] uh thank you so much. We love you, Lord.

[13:59] neighbor's hand as you're taking your

[29:44] bless our souls, Lord, with your word,
[29:46] that eternal word. Father, may the deep
[29:49] call to the deep by the simplicity,

[29:58] is so simple, yet it is so deep. Amen.
[30:01] And so I ask that you would come this

[30:36] it's always an honor and a privilege to

[30:40] feedback here, brethren. And uh I just
[30:43] want to thank brother Ron for the
[30:45] opportunity once again to minister the
[30:48] word. Amen. Amen. Proverbs chap 24 and
[30:52] verses
[30:54] uh 30 through34. I went by the
[30:58] field of the
[31:00] slothful and by the vineyard of the man
[31:03] void of understanding.
[31:05] And lo, it was all grown over with
[31:08] thorns, and nettles had covered the face
[31:11] thereof, and the stone wall thereof was
[31:15] broken down. Then I saw and considered
[31:18] it well. I looked upon it, and received
[31:22] instruction. Yet a little sleep, a
[31:24] little slumber, a little folding of the
[31:26] hands to sleep. And so shall thy poverty
[31:29] come as one that travelth, and thy want
[31:32] as an armed man. Amen. and you may be
[31:35] seated this
[31:40] evening. I would like to take for a
[31:43] title this evening and call it your
[31:46] vineyard. Your vineyard. And
[31:49] um we've been uh speaking here for a
[31:53] little while on neighbor's vineyard and
[31:56] stuff and uh it seems like I just can't
[31:58] get off this subject. But the Lord
[32:01] willing, I I feel uh perhaps that um
[32:04] I'll have exhausted this thought. But
[32:07] you know, I've learned to say never say
[32:09] never. Amen. Uh because you never know
[32:11] what the Lord will will open up to you
[32:13] in the future. But we've been speaking
[32:16] about this uh about vineyards here. And
[32:18] we see in our opening scripture that um
[32:23] it is it is of a man that was uh uh void
[32:27] of understanding. and he was an owner of
[32:30] a vineyard. And as I as I read that
[32:34] scripture, um the thought kind of came
[32:37] to me that uh that this person, this
[32:40] husbandman that was over this vineyard
[32:42] or this farmer or this caretaker,
[32:44] whatever name you want to give this
[32:46] person, uh I don't believe that he was
[32:50] void of understanding and how to take
[32:52] care of the vineyard. otherwise he would
[32:55] never have been in charge of taking care
[32:58] of it. But as I as I read the scripture
[33:00] and I believe that if you if you put it
[33:02] in context with the other the other
[33:04] verses that we read, I believe that the
[33:07] understanding that this man was void of
[33:10] was uh uh he was void of of not
[33:14] realizing that how laziness can overtake
[33:17] a person and how that slothfulness can
[33:20] have such a dramatic effect in our
[33:23] lives. And so it it wasn't the it wasn't
[33:27] that he didn't know how to take care of
[33:30] the vineyard. It was because he was lazy
[33:33] in taking care of his vineyard. And
[33:35] because he was lazy in his work and he
[33:38] was lazy and slothful and taking care of
[33:41] the thing that God had put him in charge
[33:43] over to take care of, it had an effect
[33:46] on the outcome of the vineyard. So
[33:48] instead of the vineyard being uh the
[33:50] walls being being strong and high and
[33:53] instead of the vineyard being uh
[33:55] plentiful and fruitful and and and a and
[33:57] a pleasant place to be and and bringing
[33:59] forth much fruit, it was quite the
[34:01] contrary. It was quite the opposite.
[34:04] Whenever the whenever uh this vineyard
[34:07] was looked upon, lo, the the the walls
[34:09] was torn down and and and nettles had
[34:12] overgrown and and and and as we read
[34:15] there that there was nettles and there
[34:17] was thorns and things that shouldn't be
[34:20] in the vineyard was there. Amen.
[34:23] Why were they there? Because he was
[34:25] slothful in his work. Right? Understand
[34:29] that you and I, we are we are a vineyard
[34:32] onto ourselves and within ourselves, we
[34:36] are our own husbandmen. We are the
[34:39] caretaker of our own bodies and of our
[34:42] own vineyard. And God is expecting us in
[34:45] our Christian walk not to be slothful.
[34:48] He's expecting us in our Christian walk
[34:50] not to be lazy in serving God. Because
[34:54] when we're lazy in serving God, behold,
[34:57] thorns appear.
[34:59] When we're slothful with our
[35:00] servantthood towards God and loving him
[35:03] and serving his people, when we're
[35:05] slothful towards it, behold, there's
[35:07] briars. Amen. Behold, there's nettles.
[35:11] Behold, there's thorns. Behold, the
[35:13] vineyard is not bringing forth the fruit
[35:16] that it should be bringing forth. Why?
[35:18] Because of laziness. Amen.
[35:23] My because of
[35:25] slothfulness, because of a little
[35:29] procrastination, a little putting off
[35:31] until tomorrow. Let me say this, saints
[35:33] of God, don't put off until tomorrow
[35:36] what can be done today.
[35:40] Now notice as brother Brandham, he he
[35:42] picks this this thought up on laziness
[35:45] and the uncertain sound and he says, "I
[35:48] can't get my boy up at the morning." And
[35:51] some of you fathers say, "Amen."
[35:54] He looks like if he just got his day and
[35:57] night turned around. I said, "Billy,
[35:59] you'll never be no account laying there
[36:01] like that. Get up." Right? I feel like I
[36:05] need to say to some of us this evening,
[36:07] get up. Get up and do something. Notice
[36:10] he tells them, "Get up. If you don't do
[36:12] no more than go out and wash your teeth
[36:15] and go out into the yard and look at
[36:17] your car and come back in, sit down and
[36:20] read." He's saying, "Don't just lay in
[36:22] your bed all morning, but get out of
[36:24] your bed. Go do something." Amen. Go try
[36:28] making your bed once in a while. Amen.
[36:32] Have you ever seen that? that uh uh that
[36:34] sergeant or the Navy guy or whatever he
[36:36] is and he says, "If you want to change
[36:38] the world, make your bed.
[36:43] Start by making your bed." Well, what is
[36:46] so important about making my bed? That's
[36:48] not very spiritual, brother Stephen. It
[36:50] is because it's your first victory. It's
[36:53] pride of ownership. It's all I'm going
[36:55] to get out of bed. I'm not going to be
[36:58] lazy and I'm going to make my bed and
[37:00] I'm going to make it nice. Amen.
[37:04] I have a question for you. Whenever you
[37:06] get married, is it the is it the
[37:08] husband's job to make the bed or is it
[37:10] the woman's job to make the bed?
[37:14] We'll let you answer that
[37:17] one. You're all I felt that. I was like,
[37:22] woohoo. He's really going to go there,
[37:25] isn't he?
[37:29] Last one out of bed. Make the bed,
[37:35] man. He says, "Get up. You don't do more
[37:38] than go out and wash your teeth and go
[37:40] out in the yard and sit down and read.
[37:42] Don't lay in bed. No good.
[37:45] Laziness." Now listen to this. God have
[37:48] mercy on these lazyhearted Christians
[37:52] become no good.
[37:55] So what is wrong with laziness in the
[37:58] natural? It affects our life in the
[38:00] spiritual.
[38:03] He says, "God, have lazy on our mercy on
[38:07] these lazyhearted Christians know so
[38:09] much about it and tell so little to
[38:11] other people about it. They're lazy in
[38:15] their testimony to those around them.
[38:18] Oh, we know the great mysteries and we
[38:20] can explain this and this, that, and the
[38:22] other." But yet when it comes time to
[38:24] talk to our neighbor about the gospel,
[38:27] when it comes time to serving somebody
[38:29] within the body of Jesus Christ, we
[38:32] become so lazy.
[38:35] Somebody else will do it. That's not my
[38:38] job. That is someone else's job. Lord
[38:42] have mercy. Amen. Upon us lazy
[38:46] Christians.
[38:49] See how I put myself in there?
[38:52] Yeah.
[38:55] He says, "Uh uh, Daddy, I just can't get
[38:59] up early." I said, "Look, Billy, one of
[39:02] these days you ain't going to have no
[39:04] daddy to take care of you. Daddy is
[39:06] going to be gone one of these mornings.
[39:08] You You come in the room and look,
[39:10] perhaps daddy will be laying there.
[39:11] You'll shake him. He won't wake." I
[39:13] said, "Then they'll they'll hold me down
[39:15] this little old church in a box. You'll
[39:18] pass by your handkerchief in your hand
[39:20] crying, look down and say, "That's my
[39:22] old dad. I wish I'd listened to him." I
[39:26] said, "But remember, Billy, I've always
[39:28] been an early riser." Hallelujah. He
[39:31] says, "Blessed trumpet sounds. I'll come
[39:34] forth in the first resurrection. I
[39:37] believe in rising early." Hallelujah.
[39:40] Some glorious day by the grace of God. I
[39:43] believe this gospel that I preach, I
[39:46] believe it's the honest truth. So what
[39:49] is brother Brandham talking about here,
[39:52] talking about rising early? He's talking
[39:55] about the first resurrection. He's
[39:58] talking about if if oh they'll if I die
[40:00] and you'll see me and they'll put me in
[40:02] this casket and they'll put me in the
[40:04] ground. He's saying that's not my end
[40:06] right there, Billy. If they put me in
[40:09] the ground, that's not my final
[40:11] destination. that's not my final resting
[40:14] place. And he gets all excited and he
[40:16] says, "Hallelujah. I'm an early riser."
[40:18] Why? Because those in the first
[40:20] resurrection shall rise first. They'll
[40:23] rise early. If the death is to take
[40:26] them, they will rise first in Jesus
[40:29] Christ.
[40:30] Praise the Lord. My brother, my sister,
[40:33] if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved,
[40:36] and if we are to go the way by death, we
[40:39] have another tabernacle already waiting
[40:42] for us that is not made by hands, but
[40:45] it's made by God himself.
[40:50] It's already waiting for us. There's a
[40:52] day that's according to the scripture
[40:54] that lays just ahead that says the dead
[40:57] in Christ shall rise first. That's the
[41:01] first resurrection. And then we which
[41:03] are alive and remain will be caught up
[41:05] together with who? With those in the
[41:09] first resurrection. Brother Brandham
[41:12] says we'll be caught up. We'll be with
[41:14] those who are resurrected in the first
[41:17] resurrection first before we meet Jesus
[41:20] in the air. Amen. Oh, what a time
[41:23] that'll be. Oh, yeah. Could you imagine
[41:26] some of your relatives or some of these
[41:28] that have that have passed on through
[41:30] the years within the assembly and you
[41:32] begin to look and you see something
[41:33] strange and you think, "My, there's no
[41:36] way that looks like so and so. It looks
[41:40] like uh uh uh Poppy. It looks like the
[41:43] picture that used to sit there on the
[41:45] desk. There's no way that that's him.
[41:48] There's no way that that's her. That
[41:50] there's no way. I'm telling you, there's
[41:52] a way. And it's going to happen one of
[41:55] these days. And can you imagine the
[41:57] faith that'll arise within the bride of
[41:59] Jesus Christ? And you say, "It's on.
[42:02] It's on. The rapture is on." But let me
[42:05] say this. Blessed is he who has not seen
[42:09] but yet believes. I want to say the
[42:12] rapture is on right now. Though I see
[42:15] somebody in the first resurrection or
[42:17] not, it doesn't matter to me because I
[42:20] believe the word. Amen. Amen. That's
[42:22] right.
[42:24] Well, I just want to see something. You
[42:26] don't need to see anything because
[42:28] seeing is not believing. That is no
[42:31] longer faith. I say, Father, let faith
[42:34] arise in our hearts. That we don't have
[42:36] to see anything. We don't have to feel
[42:38] anything. We don't have to hear
[42:40] anything. We don't have to smell
[42:41] anything, but we can just believe the
[42:44] word for what it says. That's true.
[42:47] Genuine faith is believing the word.
[42:50] Help us, Lord. Especially when it's
[42:53] contrary to your senses.
[42:57] My so much of the time we read the word
[43:00] and we try to reason it with our carnal
[43:03] reasoning and our carnal understanding
[43:05] and we try to figure it out and we try
[43:08] to put this together and that together
[43:10] and and we just end up making a whole
[43:12] mess of everything.
[43:14] If you don't understand something, just
[43:17] put it in the back burner. Amen. Amen.
[43:20] Just say, "Father, I don't understand
[43:22] what I'm reading right now. I don't
[43:25] understand this quote that brother
[43:26] Brandham just said." Tell the Lord.
[43:30] Put it on the back burner and move on
[43:33] with life. Amen. Because on down life,
[43:36] you're going to have one of those aha
[43:38] moments. I always wondered about that
[43:41] scripture. You remember brother Brandham
[43:44] said, "I always I always wondered what
[43:46] heaven would be like.
[43:48] I always wondered, would we would we be
[43:50] a cloud and we're just we're just up in
[43:52] heaven and we're just we're just clouds
[43:54] and and and I and I'll know Brother
[43:56] Neville's voice, but I'll never be able
[43:57] to shake his hand because because I he
[44:00] just didn't understand it. Well, because
[44:02] he didn't understand it, it didn't mean
[44:04] that he quit preaching. It didn't mean
[44:07] that he quit walking with the Lord, but
[44:08] he just put it on the back burner. And
[44:10] then when he crossed over uh beyond the
[44:13] curtain of time, he said, "Oh my, I've
[44:16] I've feared this my whole life."
[44:20] There's nothing to fear in the promises
[44:22] of God. That's right. I've always
[44:25] wondered about this. I always wondered
[44:27] how it would be. And here throughout the
[44:31] process of time, what would happen? God
[44:33] would unfold himself to his prophet
[44:36] messenger. You see, God just doesn't
[44:39] bombard us with revelation and tell us
[44:42] everything all at once. No, he gives it
[44:44] to us as we are in need of it. And
[44:47] sometimes it seems God leaves us
[44:50] hanging.
[44:51] But God has never left you hanging one
[44:54] time. He's just wanting to see your
[44:56] reaction to what's going on in your
[44:57] life. Amen. Yes, sir.
[45:04] In the sermon, leadership, paragraph
[45:07] 36, because remember, you're going to
[45:10] die someday or either be translated into
[45:13] heaven. And if you die before his
[45:15] coming, you will be raptured first. Did
[45:19] you know that? Did you know that those
[45:21] who are dead, if mama papa dies before
[45:23] you do, and Jesus doesn't come in our
[45:25] generation? Do you know that? that these
[45:27] mama and papa will will come forth first
[45:31] glorified before you see the trumpet of
[45:34] God shall sound and the dead in Christ
[45:36] shall rise first then we which are alive
[45:39] and remain shall be caught up with them
[45:42] will be changed like that we've got to
[45:46] remember that's the main thing in life
[45:48] you want to know what a prophet of God
[45:50] said what the main thing in life is
[45:52] listen to this you understand now that's
[45:54] the main thing in life we got to do is
[45:57] get ready to meet God. Amen. I got news
[46:02] for you. Your 401k is not the most
[46:05] important part of your life. And some of
[46:08] you right now are saying, "Yes, it is
[46:12] because I'm losing so much money in my
[46:15] 401k." I've got news for you. It's going
[46:18] to go all bankrupt. Anyways, our job is
[46:21] not the most important thing. The most
[46:23] important thing is that we get ready to
[46:26] meet God. And getting ready to meet God
[46:29] is a process. It is not just one week
[46:32] that you do good and the next week that
[46:34] you don't do good or it's not just a
[46:36] one-time deal. No, it's a daily
[46:38] relationship with God Almighty. a daily
[46:42] relationship through prayer and and and
[46:44] and reading our Bibles and
[46:46] fellowshipping one with another,
[46:49] strengthening one with another,
[46:50] encouraging each other with these words.
[46:55] Praise the Lord. That's part of your
[46:58] ministry
[46:59] is to encourage those around you.
[47:03] You say, "I don't have a ministry." Sure
[47:05] you do. You can tell someone it's going
[47:08] to be okay. Yeah. You know, you can tell
[47:11] someone that that you're their friend.
[47:13] Could you imagine that would make
[47:15] somebody feel really good? True. You can
[47:18] call up somebody one time and say, "Hey,
[47:21] how are you doing?" Yeah. Is everything
[47:24] okay? Doesn't sound very spiritual.
[47:27] Doesn't sound like a very good ministry.
[47:30] But if you can help a brother or sister
[47:32] because the Bible says this that iron
[47:34] sharpens iron. And if you can help one
[47:38] person along life's journey with their
[47:40] journey with Jesus Christ, it is all
[47:42] worth it. Amen.
[47:46] You know that there's nothing greater
[47:48] than giving. Yeah. Have you ever Have
[47:52] you ever done something for somebody or
[47:55] gave something to someone or helped
[47:57] somebody in a certain way that you knew
[47:59] they that they just can't help you back
[48:02] and you knew that you're not going to
[48:04] get anything in return? Do you remember
[48:07] how good that made you feel? Do you
[48:10] remember it gets even better when it
[48:12] actually kind of hurts a little bit?
[48:14] That's right.
[48:16] that you're not in a in perhaps the
[48:18] right financial situation to help
[48:20] somebody, but yet you do it because
[48:22] you're doing it onto God. The feeling of
[48:26] giving, that's why Jesus counted it,
[48:29] hallelujah, all joy. Yes. For the cross
[48:33] that was set before him. Why? Because he
[48:36] was giving himself for you and I. That's
[48:39] why he could look at the hardest day of
[48:42] his life, whether it was Gethsemane or
[48:44] on a cross, wherever it may be, and he
[48:46] didn't shy away from it. But he set his
[48:49] face towards Jerusalem. Why? Because he
[48:51] had you and me in his mind. Why? Because
[48:54] he had a giving spirit. I'm no man can
[48:57] take my life from me. I freely give my
[49:00] life. I lay my life down and I can raise
[49:03] it up again. Praise you, Jesus. Praise
[49:06] the Lord. Ain't nobody took his life.
[49:09] He laid it down. He gave it freely.
[49:12] Hallelujah. He gave it willingly.
[49:15] How many willing people do we have
[49:17] amongst us tonight that's going to say,
[49:19] "I am willing to serve the Lord Jesus to
[49:23] the best of my ability."
[49:25] Amen.
[49:27] Absolutely.
[49:28] Friends, don't let anybody or any
[49:30] circumstance or any situation hinder you
[49:34] from moving on and getting ready to meet
[49:37] the Lord Jesus. That's right. Amen.
[49:40] Because guess what? We all got we all
[49:44] got some kind of excuse. Amen.
[49:48] Humanity,
[49:50] we've all been around the block. We all
[49:53] have some kind of excuse. Well, this and
[49:55] that and my family member and this one
[49:57] and that one and Yeah. and and and and I
[49:59] just can't get ready the Lord serve the
[50:01] Lord like I want to because of this.
[50:05] Hey, you got to lay that stuff aside.
[50:07] That's right. Yeah. We got to bury that
[50:09] stuff because guess what? It's just
[50:10] hindering you. Stop making excuses.
[50:13] Billy Paul said, "I'm not an early
[50:14] morning, Dad." He's saying, "Well, just
[50:16] get up.
[50:19] Ain't no excuse." Amen. Just get up.
[50:23] Amen. Just get up and do
[50:27] something. Brush your teeth. Make your
[50:30] bed. Look at your car. And by that time,
[50:34] you'll be awake and sit down and read
[50:36] your Bible.
[50:39] Amen. Right.
[50:42] Wow. Many of you brush your teeth first
[50:44] and then drink your coffee afterwards.
[50:50] That was just random. But you're
[50:52] welcome.
[50:54] So we find out that this husbandman, he
[50:57] was
[50:58] lazy. He was slothful in regards of
[51:01] taking care of the vineyard because this
[51:03] vineyard had become overthrown with
[51:05] nettles in the stone wall and everything
[51:07] was taken down. You know what had
[51:09] happened to him in his life? He had
[51:10] become
[51:12] lukewarm. That's a word that us in
[51:15] Leodysia are very familiar with. Amen.
[51:18] Is lukewarmness. Why? Because
[51:20] lukewarmness is the spirit that's on
[51:23] this age right now. That's right. You
[51:26] say, "Brother Steven, we are not in the
[51:28] Leodysian church age. We are in the
[51:31] bride age. We are in the bride
[51:34] dispensation while amongst this age of
[51:37] Leodysia."
[51:38] And if you say that Leodysia doesn't
[51:41] affect you, you're a liar.
[51:44] But we've got to be aware of it. Because
[51:47] if we can become aware of it, we know
[51:50] how to fight it. We know how to combat
[51:52] it. But if we are unaware of
[51:53] lukewarmness and laziness in our lives,
[51:56] how can we do something for God?
[52:01] Understand? You are a vineyard. You are
[52:04] a caretaker. You are a husbandman of the
[52:07] vineyard in your life. Very good. What
[52:10] is the condition of your vineyard?
[52:15] Hallelujah. Is your vineyard all grown
[52:18] over? Has it got nettles throughout? Has
[52:21] it got thorns throughout it? Is the
[52:23] walls all knocked down? Cuz remember,
[52:25] you're a vineyard. You can't get away
[52:27] from it. What is the condition of your
[52:29] vineyard? There's another vineyard. Let
[52:32] me turn to it real quick. I know it cuz
[52:34] I've been looking it up. Isaiah chapter
[52:36] 5. Turn with me. Isaiah chapter 5. I
[52:41] don't have this for the brethren, but I
[52:44] just know that this is a good vineyard.
[52:48] Chapter 5 verse one. Now I will sing to
[52:50] my well beloved a song of my beloved
[52:52] touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved
[52:56] hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.
[52:59] So understand where it's planted. It was
[53:01] in a fruitful hill and he fenced it. Now
[53:05] this is a good husbandman. This is what
[53:08] a good husbandman does. He fenced it. In
[53:12] other words, he protected it. He put a
[53:14] wall around it. He guarded it. Remember,
[53:17] you are a vineyard. He protected himself
[53:21] from the spirits of the age. He put a
[53:23] wall around him. He took care of it. He
[53:26] put it in a fruitful place. Why would he
[53:28] put it in a fruitful place? Because he
[53:30] wants it to bring forth fruit. That's
[53:33] right. God wants our lives to be
[53:36] fruitful Christian lives. Amen.
[53:41] He fenced it and he gathered out the
[53:43] stones thereof and planted it in in the
[53:46] choicest vine and built a tower in the
[53:49] midst of it and also made a wine press
[53:51] therein. And he looked that it should
[53:53] bring forth grapes and it brought forth
[53:56] wild grapes.
[53:59] Do you know what the difference is in a
[54:01] in a in a grape and a wild grape?
[54:03] It's how it grows. It's the actual fruit
[54:06] that it produces.
[54:08] So, a a wild grape is a is a grape that
[54:12] has grown in the
[54:13] wild. And because of that, there's
[54:16] thorns and there's nettles and there's
[54:18] bushes and there's all kinds of things
[54:20] that that hinder it from bringing forth
[54:22] to its full potential.
[54:26] And a wild grape is smaller in size.
[54:29] A wild grape is more tardy. than a real
[54:33] grape that has been raised correctly. It
[54:36] It doesn't taste as good. It doesn't
[54:38] bring forth. It doesn't produce to its
[54:40] full potential like it should produce.
[54:43] Why? Because it's grown in the wild.
[54:47] What kind of fruit are we bringing forth
[54:49] in our vineyard? It all depends on the
[54:52] husbandman and how he's taking care of
[54:55] his vineyard. That's right. That's true.
[54:58] Hallelujah.
[54:59] So, a good one, what does he do?
[55:02] He be he he chooses the the choicest
[55:05] place, a place on a fruitful hill, and
[55:08] he builds a a tower around it and he
[55:11] takes it and he plants it and he takes
[55:13] care of it and he pulls away the weeds
[55:15] and pulls away the nettles and the
[55:17] branches that aren't supposed to be
[55:18] there. Are you thinking about your own
[55:20] spiritual life now? Put your own
[55:22] spiritual uh uh uh mind, your spiritual
[55:25] cap on right now. and and he takes it
[55:28] and he and he pulls this out of it and
[55:30] he pulls that out of it and he says this
[55:32] doesn't belong in in this person's life
[55:34] and this doesn't belong there and I've
[55:36] been holding on to these thorns between
[55:39] these stones for way too long.
[55:43] Help us, Lord. Some of us hold on to
[55:46] thorns and nettles in our
[55:48] vineyard because we enjoy the pity party
[55:54] because it's it's a it's an excuse for
[55:56] us not to give our all for the Lord. I'm
[56:00] I say let's lay everything to the side
[56:02] and let's clean up our vineyard. Let's
[56:04] go in and pull the nettles and pull the
[56:06] thorns and the heartaches and the
[56:08] circumstances and the complex and the
[56:10] broken hearts and all those different
[56:12] things. Let's lay him to the side
[56:14] tonight.
[56:16] Let's bundle it up
[56:19] and let's burn it.
[56:22] I think saints of
[56:24] God, we're too far down the line to be
[56:28] holding grudges. Amen. I do. I do. You
[56:33] want me to Let me share. You know, a lot
[56:35] of times I share things and uh I I put
[56:38] myself out there so much and that's
[56:41] okay. I can hold grudges. That is
[56:44] something, man, that I
[56:48] I'm like I remember we'd go out and we
[56:52] were living a riotist life. Let me just
[56:54] say that. And you know, you get into a
[56:58] fight or whatever. Well, the next week
[57:00] these guys, they can't let it go. They
[57:03] see you, they want to fight you again.
[57:05] And then the next week you want to fight
[57:06] them. And it don't matter if you win or
[57:09] you get beat. You know, it's just tit
[57:11] for tot. And you hold that grudge until
[57:13] the very death. I'll never let go of
[57:15] this because I'm Irish and I'm a
[57:19] fighter. Bury that thing. Amen. How to
[57:23] bury our traditions,
[57:25] our nationalities,
[57:27] huh? What am I going to use? Uh cuz I'm
[57:30] Irish, therefore I can hold a grudge
[57:32] against everybody. Nonsense.
[57:36] We ought to forgive each other. Amen.
[57:40] So, since I became a
[57:42] Christian, grudges against people that
[57:44] do things to me I'm okay with, I'm being
[57:47] honest, okay? Well, whatever. Silly, but
[57:51] when people do something against people
[57:54] I love or they say somebody like, if
[57:57] there was somebody at another church
[57:58] said something about one of you guys, it
[58:00] would make me so
[58:02] mad. I would I would get so angry
[58:06] against our pastor. I'll take that one
[58:08] to the death, you
[58:11] know. I'll take that to the grave with
[58:13] me. It's just hard because I'm loyal
[58:18] and I'm loyal to those who I count
[58:20] family and friends. And so that's hard
[58:24] for me. So you guys be careful you don't
[58:27] get on the wrong side of me.
[58:33] Grudges,
[58:35] root of bitterness,
[58:37] Ah, this person over here, my goodness,
[58:40] it's so easy, saints of God, that your
[58:43] natural man, your carnal man can get so
[58:46] raised up. You know, as this silly iPad,
[58:49] I was trying to send my notes and it
[58:50] wouldn't send twice. And that's
[58:52] whatever. And so I'm like, man, I feel
[58:55] like bouncing that thing off the
[58:59] wall. I'm about to minister.
[59:02] How amazing is it that you can get so
[59:05] carnal and spiritual at the same time?
[59:07] But I want you to know that you're going
[59:09] to have a sticky nature and you're going
[59:11] to have to fight that sticky nature
[59:13] until the Lord takes us home.
[59:15] Hallelujah. So learn how to fight your
[59:18] sticky nature.
[59:20] Help us, Lord. Some are more sticky than
[59:23] others. It's true. But
[59:25] nonetheless, you got to fight it.
[59:28] True. He became lukewarm in his position
[59:32] as a caretaker in the vineyard and he
[59:35] left off keeping his vineyard in order.
[59:38] Uh the exposition of the seven church
[59:40] ages the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[59:42] Brother Brennham says now remember this
[59:45] Christ in the true church is a
[59:47] continuation of the book of acts. But
[59:49] the book of revelation shows how that
[59:51] antichrist spirit would come into the
[59:54] church and defile it. What does he want
[59:58] to do? He wants to defile the church.
[1:00:01] How does he do it? He does it by making
[1:00:04] it look lukewarm, formal, and powerless.
[1:00:08] It exposes Satan, revealing his works uh
[1:00:12] uh attempted destruction of God's people
[1:00:15] and the discrediting of God's word right
[1:00:18] down to the time he is cast into the
[1:00:20] lake of fire. So, what is what is the
[1:00:22] purpose of Satan within the church? He
[1:00:25] wants to defile the church.
[1:00:28] Satan ain't our friend. That's right. He
[1:00:31] wants to defile the church. And he does
[1:00:33] it by making it lukewarm, by making it
[1:00:37] formal and therefore powerless.
[1:00:41] This is how Satan defiles the church. So
[1:00:45] this is the fruit of Satan. We see that
[1:00:49] laziness or this this uh this lukewarm
[1:00:52] condition. We see that formalities and
[1:00:56] traditions of men, what does it do? It
[1:00:58] is a fruit of Satan within the framework
[1:01:01] of the church. But understand it doesn't
[1:01:04] stop within the framework of the church
[1:01:07] because he wants to get it into the
[1:01:10] framework of our lives. Amen. So what
[1:01:14] does Satan want to do with us as sons
[1:01:17] and daughters of God? He wants to defile
[1:01:20] our Christian lives.
[1:01:24] And how does he do it? He does it by
[1:01:26] first of all bringing a lukewarmness
[1:01:28] into our lives. Bringing a lukewarmness
[1:01:31] into our heart. Making our spirit look
[1:01:34] warm and and happy go easy to the things
[1:01:37] of the world and and and and and just
[1:01:40] being lukewarm in our lives. Neither
[1:01:42] being cold nor hot, but we're right in
[1:01:44] the middle of the road.
[1:01:47] I wonder, this is just a hypothetical
[1:01:50] question. I wonder how much of us saying
[1:01:53] that we are walking in the middle of the
[1:01:55] road that it's a lukewarm place
[1:01:59] because we're neither hot and we're not
[1:02:01] cold. And the Lord wants us to be hot or
[1:02:04] cold, but he wants us to be hot.
[1:02:07] Well, how do I balance out being too
[1:02:09] spiritual? Does that mean I have to be a
[1:02:12] little more carnal?
[1:02:14] Does that mean I have to feed on the
[1:02:15] things of the world because I don't want
[1:02:17] to get too spiritual? I would rather be
[1:02:20] too spiritual than too carnal. Amen.
[1:02:25] So what does Satan does? Satan wants to
[1:02:27] defile you. He wants to defile your
[1:02:30] life. He wants to defile defile your
[1:02:33] family's life, your children, your
[1:02:35] marriage, so on and so forth because he
[1:02:37] wants to defile you because that's how
[1:02:40] he that's how he wants to get you off
[1:02:42] the beaten track.
[1:02:44] We think of defilement that uh everybody
[1:02:47] has to go out here and live live in
[1:02:49] adultery and fall away from the message
[1:02:50] and uh now I'm defiled. No, a defiled
[1:02:54] spirit is a lukewarm spirit. Yes, sir. A
[1:02:57] defiled spirit is a spirit of
[1:03:00] formalities.
[1:03:01] It's all formal.
[1:03:04] We come to church because that's what we
[1:03:06] do as Christians. It's a formality. It's
[1:03:09] a tradition. And if Satan can get us
[1:03:12] into a place of formalities and we we
[1:03:14] come to church and we sit in the same
[1:03:16] seats and and and and we and we uh we
[1:03:19] sing the same songs and and and we wear
[1:03:22] the same Wednesday night outfit and it's
[1:03:24] a form it's a formality. Yeah, it it's a
[1:03:27] it's a tradition. We we eat the same
[1:03:29] thing before we go to church. We we you
[1:03:31] know, whatever. It's a tradition. It's a
[1:03:35] formality. And if we're not careful, we
[1:03:37] bring it into the church and we just sit
[1:03:39] there and we say, "It's just another
[1:03:41] Wednesday night service." That's right.
[1:03:43] Is he done yet?
[1:03:47] When's the preacher going to stop
[1:03:48] preaching? instead of having an
[1:03:51] expectation
[1:03:54] without our throughout our our
[1:03:55] anniversary meetings. It was just
[1:03:57] wonderful. And the expectation was
[1:04:00] there. And I remember coming out of
[1:04:02] those doors and everybody was already
[1:04:04] singing. Brother Robert wasn't out here
[1:04:06] yet. Brother Mark wasn't out here yet.
[1:04:08] The expectation was so high. Why?
[1:04:12] Because we wanted to hear from God at
[1:04:14] special meetings. Why do we have to wait
[1:04:16] for special meetings before we can
[1:04:19] anticipate a moving of God in our lives?
[1:04:22] Why do we have to wait for something
[1:04:23] special? Every church service is
[1:04:26] special.
[1:04:28] So, we need to get out of our
[1:04:29] formalities, out of our traditions that
[1:04:32] we've set without even knowing it, and
[1:04:34] say, "Father, I'm going to church
[1:04:36] tonight cuz I want to hear from you. I'm
[1:04:38] so excited tonight for the service."
[1:04:41] Why? Because we're going to sit in the
[1:04:43] presence of God. Amen.
[1:04:46] Seated in heavenly places in Christ
[1:04:49] Jesus. You know, Brother Brandham said
[1:04:51] that that's what this is right now. Now,
[1:04:53] you're sitting in heavenly places. Why?
[1:04:57] Because the eternal word is going forth
[1:04:59] and it's feeding your soul. Praise the
[1:05:02] Lord. Thank you, Jesus. But what holds
[1:05:05] us back?
[1:05:08] Liquorness.
[1:05:10] Defilement of spirit.
[1:05:14] defilement of traditions, defilement of
[1:05:18] formalities, and until it gets us to a
[1:05:22] point where we're powerless,
[1:05:26] we're powerless over the battle of the
[1:05:29] mind, we're b we're powerless over
[1:05:31] making right choices. We're powerless
[1:05:33] before Satan because we've stopped
[1:05:36] exercising our faith. Amen.
[1:05:40] We've become powerless due to the
[1:05:42] defilement of
[1:05:44] lukewarmness, formalities, and
[1:05:46] traditions of men.
[1:05:49] God help us
[1:05:52] as sons and daughters of God to realize
[1:05:55] the tactics of Satan. Because when we
[1:05:58] realize his tactics, now we have a now
[1:06:01] we have a punch in the fight, if I can
[1:06:03] say it like that. Now we have we have a
[1:06:05] chance here. Now we know what he's going
[1:06:07] to come at us with. Now we can
[1:06:09] counteract it. Now we can get our guard
[1:06:12] up. Now we can put our shield of faith
[1:06:14] up and not only have a shield of faith
[1:06:16] and a helmet of salvation, but stand
[1:06:18] with the sword of the word in our hands.
[1:06:21] Amen. Amen, sir. That's I'm fighting
[1:06:24] this thing.
[1:06:26] I'm fighting this formality stuff. I'm
[1:06:29] fighting this lukewarmness. Guess what
[1:06:31] I'm going to do? I'm going to get out of
[1:06:33] bed. I'm going to brush my teeth. I'm
[1:06:36] going to get to church as early as I
[1:06:38] can. I'm going to make an effort to
[1:06:41] bring my liquifier to everybody else's
[1:06:44] liquifier.
[1:06:48] Yeah. Sometimes we just sometimes we we
[1:06:51] depend upon the minister to bring us up
[1:06:53] to bring us up to to make us feel good
[1:06:56] to to bring us up to higher heights. But
[1:06:57] I wonder if we in the congregation if we
[1:07:01] were to bring the minister up
[1:07:03] here. You get brother Chad Lamb. He
[1:07:05] says, "I I can't even talk. I don't even
[1:07:08] know what to say. My mind is going in
[1:07:10] too many directions." Why? Because we
[1:07:13] broke out of formalities. We broke out
[1:07:15] of lukewarmness.
[1:07:18] Hallelujah.
[1:07:20] You ought to be writing this down in the
[1:07:22] memory of your mind or upon your hearts
[1:07:24] and say, "I'm going to keep an eye out
[1:07:25] for this. Going to keep an eye out for
[1:07:27] it on Monday. I'm going to keep an eye
[1:07:29] out on it on Tuesday and on Thursday and
[1:07:31] on Friday because I don't want to be
[1:07:33] lukewarm." Amen.
[1:07:38] I know he's not going to spew me out of
[1:07:40] his mouth because that scripture is not
[1:07:42] for me.
[1:07:44] But I still feel the pressures
[1:07:48] of Leodysa.
[1:07:53] And what is a pressure? You know what it
[1:07:55] really is? It's a spirit. Amen. The
[1:07:58] spirits of Leodysia that encompasses us
[1:08:01] on a daily basis and bombards us.
[1:08:07] Hallelujah. But saints of God, when the
[1:08:10] devil comes in like a flood, God will
[1:08:12] raise up a standard against it. Thank
[1:08:14] you, Lord.
[1:08:21] Hallelujah.
[1:08:23] the in the sermon Jehovah Gyra 1962. We
[1:08:27] must remember that nothing can be done
[1:08:29] without faith and it first has to be
[1:08:33] confessed. He is the author of faith. We
[1:08:37] know that and and that nothing can be
[1:08:39] done without faith and without faith
[1:08:41] it's impossible to please God. And now
[1:08:44] he is the high priest of our confession.
[1:08:46] Now the in the King James here in the
[1:08:48] book of Hebrews put put it a profession
[1:08:51] to profess and confess is the same
[1:08:52] thing. Confess means to say the same
[1:08:55] thing. So now he goes into the scripture
[1:08:58] and he says by his stripes I am healed.
[1:09:01] See now by his life I am saved. What is
[1:09:05] he doing? He's quoting and confessing
[1:09:07] scriptures that you and I ought to be
[1:09:10] confessing.
[1:09:12] He says now by his life I am saved. And
[1:09:15] we've first we've got to confess it. And
[1:09:19] he sets as a mediator, the only mediator
[1:09:22] between mana, God, and man. And he sits
[1:09:24] there to make intercessions upon what we
[1:09:28] confess that he has done. Amen. Not what
[1:09:34] he's going to do, but we're confessing
[1:09:37] what he has already done. Thank you,
[1:09:41] Lord. I love this part of this this
[1:09:44] quote. He said, "What a sound, solid
[1:09:48] thing that is." Amen.
[1:09:52] Praise the Lord. The word of God is a
[1:09:55] firm foundation.
[1:09:57] It is a solid foundation. It is a firm
[1:10:00] rock that will not be moved. It will not
[1:10:02] be shattered. It will not be broken, but
[1:10:04] it's firm and unmovable.
[1:10:06] Praise the Lord. That's the word of God.
[1:10:10] Amen. So now by exercising our faith,
[1:10:14] brother Brandham is giving this this
[1:10:16] insight in how to exercise our faith
[1:10:19] because remember if we're lukewarm,
[1:10:21] formal and powerless at the end of the
[1:10:24] day it means our faith is low.
[1:10:28] But if we can learn to combat that and
[1:10:30] exercise our faith, brother Brandham
[1:10:33] says by his stripes I am healed. He
[1:10:38] said, uh, what a sound solid thing that
[1:10:42] is. So, what is you're doing? We're not
[1:10:45] confessing something that's not true.
[1:10:47] It's not the power of a of a of a
[1:10:50] positive confession within our mind. It
[1:10:52] goes beyond that. It is it is confessing
[1:10:55] the word of God, the eternal word of God
[1:10:58] that will never pass away. That is that
[1:11:01] is still the same yesterday, today, and
[1:11:03] forever. and taking it and confessing it
[1:11:05] and exercising our faith until our faith
[1:11:08] is strong.
[1:11:10] Thank you, Lord. Believing in your heart
[1:11:13] is not good enough.
[1:11:15] Believing in your heart will take you a
[1:11:18] so far.
[1:11:20] But you've got to confess it
[1:11:23] with your mouth from your heart.
[1:11:27] And it doesn't matter if anything
[1:11:29] changes in your life or not. That's
[1:11:31] true. God is working in secret
[1:11:34] because remember this, God never stops
[1:11:37] working
[1:11:39] and he works according to the confession
[1:11:43] of our faith.
[1:11:46] Not of what God might do,
[1:11:50] not of what God can do,
[1:11:54] but of what God through Jesus Christ has
[1:11:58] already done.
[1:12:00] Praise the Lord. When you get uh an
[1:12:02] understanding and a revelation of it, it
[1:12:05] it's not God can, but God already has.
[1:12:08] Amen. And if it's already done and the
[1:12:11] work is already finished and the plan of
[1:12:13] redemption is is is completed, it said
[1:12:16] it is finished. The plan, it's finished.
[1:12:17] My work here is done upon this
[1:12:20] earth. He can't do anything more for us
[1:12:23] than what he has already done. That's
[1:12:26] right. So now to exercise ourselves, we
[1:12:29] need to say, I believe your word. I have
[1:12:34] a need in my life. I have a need of
[1:12:35] healing. Therefore, I'm going to say,
[1:12:37] "Thank you for my healing because by
[1:12:39] your stripes, I am already healed. Thank
[1:12:42] you for my salvation. Thank you for what
[1:12:44] you've done. Thank you for touching my
[1:12:46] children. Thank you for the seal of God
[1:12:48] upon my family, wavered loved ones,
[1:12:50] whatever it may be, just confess the
[1:12:53] word and God will take care of the
[1:12:55] rest." Yes,
[1:12:57] remember brother Brandham uh fantastic.
[1:13:01] Even in his younger years, he's such a
[1:13:03] such a young man of faith. And remember
[1:13:05] he had the stomach ulcer and everything
[1:13:07] or whatever it was. And he would eat and
[1:13:09] he would vomit up and and all that
[1:13:10] stuff. And he would eat it and they say,
[1:13:12] "Well, if you eat, it's going to kill
[1:13:14] you, Bill. You can't eat." And he said,
[1:13:15] "Well, I believe God's word." Amen. And
[1:13:18] he kept eating it. It's going to make
[1:13:20] him throw up. It made him sick to his
[1:13:22] stomach. But he kept confessing the word
[1:13:24] of God. Why? Because the work had
[1:13:27] already been done.
[1:13:29] Even when he saw no change, he kept his
[1:13:33] confession and his faith high and
[1:13:36] strong. Amen. You want to have stronger
[1:13:39] faith. You want to have more faith,
[1:13:42] confess more
[1:13:44] and stand upon these promises of God
[1:13:47] that he's given us in this day and stand
[1:13:50] with an assurance. Amen.
[1:13:55] Hallelujah. You know, this isn't the
[1:13:57] days of this isn't the days of of of the
[1:14:00] church having no power. This isn't the
[1:14:03] days of the church having no authority.
[1:14:06] Let me share something with you. This is
[1:14:08] the age, the time of adoption.
[1:14:10] What does adoption mean? Adoption means
[1:14:13] authority and power. Why? Because we are
[1:14:16] placed in Christ Jesus.
[1:14:19] And so, you don't have to worry about
[1:14:22] it. Just confess it and have authority
[1:14:24] with it and God will take care of the
[1:14:26] rest. Amen.
[1:14:33] Instead of saying, "I believe God can.
[1:14:37] I believe he might.
[1:14:39] We should be saying I believe God
[1:14:41] already has and it's going to be done.
[1:14:45] That's right.
[1:14:48] So the purpose of a vineyard is this
[1:14:50] very very simply put is that it might
[1:14:53] bring forth fruit. John 15:es 1-8 it
[1:14:58] says I am the true vine and my father is
[1:15:00] the husbandman. Every branch in me that
[1:15:02] beareth not fruit he taketh away.
[1:15:06] Notice it was it's every branch in me.
[1:15:12] So it's a believer, a person who is
[1:15:14] already in Christ. They can get
[1:15:17] lukewarm. They can get formal and cold
[1:15:20] and not bring forth fruit even when
[1:15:24] they're in Christ. That's right.
[1:15:28] He said uh beareth not fruit. He purged
[1:15:32] it that it may bring forth more fruit.
[1:15:35] Now ye are clean through the word which
[1:15:37] I have spoken unto you. Abide in me and
[1:15:40] I in you. As the branch cannot bear
[1:15:42] fruit of itself, except it abide in the
[1:15:44] vine, no more can ye except ye abide in
[1:15:48] me. I am the vine. Ye are the branches.
[1:15:51] He that abideth in me and I in him. The
[1:15:53] same bringeth forth much fruit. For
[1:15:56] without me you can do nothing. I if if a
[1:15:59] man abide not in me, he is cast forth as
[1:16:02] a branch and is withered and men gather
[1:16:05] them and cast them into the fire and
[1:16:06] they're burned. If you abide in me and
[1:16:08] my words abide in you, ye shall ask what
[1:16:12] ye will and it shall be done onto you.
[1:16:17] How many can say it tonight? I abide in
[1:16:20] Christ and his word is abiding in me.
[1:16:23] Therefore, ask what ye will. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:28] And it shall be done unto you. Herein is
[1:16:30] my father glorified that ye bear much
[1:16:33] fruit. So shall my ye be my disciples.
[1:16:38] You want to bring glory to the father.
[1:16:40] You want the father's buttons to pop
[1:16:42] open and say that's my son. That's my
[1:16:46] daughter. I am so proud of the life that
[1:16:48] they're live. I'm so proud of how
[1:16:50] they're acting on on on this cosmos that
[1:16:52] I have created. bring forth much fruit.
[1:16:57] Amen. But remember, you are a vineyard
[1:17:01] and remember you are a husbandman and in
[1:17:04] order to bring forth fruit, there's work
[1:17:07] that has to be done in our daily lives.
[1:17:10] That's right. Very good. So, we see that
[1:17:13] this this scripture has been fulfilled
[1:17:16] throughout the seven church ages. And we
[1:17:19] realize that the father is is is asking
[1:17:22] us to bring forth much fruit, not for
[1:17:25] our own glory, but for his glory. this
[1:17:29] vine that we've been that we read of has
[1:17:32] bore branches uh brought forth branches
[1:17:35] and it it has it has borne fruit in
[1:17:37] every age of these seven church ages.
[1:17:40] For the vine is Christ and Christ is the
[1:17:43] word. So we see that we've had
[1:17:46] justification and it brought forth a
[1:17:49] branch. And in justification, guess
[1:17:51] what? They brought forth fruit for their
[1:17:53] age. But there came a time where they
[1:17:56] didn't bring forth fruit anymore. That
[1:17:59] that that God now the the great
[1:18:01] husbandman, what did he do? He he cut
[1:18:03] the branch off. He he trimmed it. He
[1:18:06] purged it. He he doesn't take it away
[1:18:09] from the vine because people under
[1:18:11] Luther, guess what? They were
[1:18:13] justified. People under Luther were
[1:18:16] saved. Amen. You know that people under
[1:18:19] Luther were the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:22] for their day. That's right.
[1:18:24] So there's no taking them away out of
[1:18:26] it. There's no taking them out of the
[1:18:28] promise because you know they were
[1:18:30] justified but yet they couldn't live a
[1:18:33] sanctified life but they lived under the
[1:18:36] light of their day.
[1:18:39] So now we see that the light keeps
[1:18:41] moving and we understand that as as the
[1:18:44] sun gets higher and brighter what does
[1:18:47] it do to a flower? It brings more out of
[1:18:49] it. What does it do to the vine? It
[1:18:51] brings more out of it. It shoots forth
[1:18:53] more branches. It brings forth more
[1:18:55] fruit. And then we see sanctification
[1:18:57] through
[1:18:58] Wesley. It was good for a time, but they
[1:19:01] put a period instead of a comma. My
[1:19:03] brother, my sister, never never put a
[1:19:06] period to your belief in God.
[1:19:10] Stop it with a comma. This is what I
[1:19:13] believe right now. Comma. And I am ready
[1:19:17] for God to reveal more of it. Amen.
[1:19:19] Because the moment that we put a period,
[1:19:22] we denominate ourselves. Brother
[1:19:25] Brandham said, "The message will never
[1:19:27] denominate, but people within the
[1:19:29] message will."
[1:19:32] Period. This is how it should be. Hey,
[1:19:36] don't go there. Don't play that game
[1:19:39] with God.
[1:19:41] Put a comma. Amen.
[1:19:44] And so we see now it it brought forth
[1:19:46] fruit and it was the light of the age
[1:19:48] and it was the word of the age. But but
[1:19:49] it only took them so far. And they came
[1:19:51] to Pentecost and the same thing. And you
[1:19:54] know, Pentecost was was as close to the
[1:19:57] real thing as what you're going to
[1:19:59] get. Brother Brandham says Pentecost was
[1:20:02] the fulfillment of Matthew
[1:20:05] 24:24. That it would deceive the elect,
[1:20:07] the elect, even if it was possible. Why?
[1:20:11] Because now shifting from a from a from
[1:20:14] a a a a vineyard to a grape plant now to
[1:20:17] a wheat to the wheat plant. Remember I
[1:20:20] love that type of the wheat plant
[1:20:22] because I can picture it in my mind. I
[1:20:24] can see the stock, the tossel, I can see
[1:20:26] the branches coming. I can see all these
[1:20:28] things and all of a sudden now it comes
[1:20:30] to the end time. And brother Brandham
[1:20:33] says if you don't have an eye for it,
[1:20:35] you'll think that Pentecost was it. He
[1:20:38] says, "But it was just the shuck. It was
[1:20:41] just a covering. It was a a carrier of
[1:20:44] the true seed." Hallelujah. The seed
[1:20:47] that went down in the ground now came up
[1:20:50] through the tassel, the stock, and now
[1:20:52] it came to the shook. And the shook
[1:20:54] looked so close to it, right? Whether it
[1:20:57] was the oneness or whether it was uh
[1:20:59] holiness dress or whatever it might have
[1:21:01] been, it was so close.
[1:21:04] But yet, it wasn't it. And it took a
[1:21:07] prophet of God to say, "Yeah, that was a
[1:21:09] birth, but we've moved on from the birth
[1:21:12] to adoption." Hallelujah.
[1:21:15] It was just a carrier of the seed. But
[1:21:18] now the seed, let me say this with as
[1:21:21] much humility as I can. The seed now is
[1:21:25] here.
[1:21:26] We're not waiting for the seed to
[1:21:29] manifest itself. We are not waiting for
[1:21:31] the seed to come and and to do something
[1:21:34] uh specially. Hey, the seed is here.
[1:21:36] Amen. We are here. We have arrived. Why?
[1:21:40] Because we've heard the message of
[1:21:42] Malachi 4.
[1:21:45] To turn our hearts back to the faith of
[1:21:48] the original seed that was in the
[1:21:50] ground. Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:53] That's why he said, "Yeah, I preached
[1:21:55] what Paul preached."
[1:21:58] Why? Because it was the same seed. The
[1:22:00] original seed went into the ground. Now
[1:22:03] it's come forth. Now, what's happening
[1:22:05] with the
[1:22:06] seed? What's happening with it? What
[1:22:09] does it do? The seed was still a little
[1:22:13] green. It takes a little time for the
[1:22:16] seed to ripen in the presence of the
[1:22:19] sun. Amen. Saints of God, that's why we
[1:22:23] don't have to jump up and pull God down.
[1:22:25] And we don't have to try to manufacture
[1:22:28] something or do something special or or
[1:22:30] or try to, you know, build up emotions
[1:22:32] and all. No, no, that's that's not the
[1:22:35] time. We're we're past that. This is
[1:22:38] seed time. This is this is a time to
[1:22:41] stay still and to vask in the presence
[1:22:44] of the sun that he might bake all the
[1:22:47] greenness out of our lives. That's what
[1:22:49] he's doing here tonight. He's baking all
[1:22:51] the greenness out of our lives. Why?
[1:22:53] Because the harvest can't come until the
[1:22:56] seed is ready.
[1:22:59] Hallelujah. That's right, brother. And
[1:23:01] we're almost there. That's right.
[1:23:04] Hallelujah.
[1:23:05] I wonder how many how many of us is
[1:23:08] holding this thing back. We talk about
[1:23:11] going to Africa and the mission field.
[1:23:13] And I just wonder is there people
[1:23:15] amongst us. Come on. That need to
[1:23:18] realize their position in Christ. That
[1:23:21] need to step up and and and and brush
[1:23:24] their teeth. They need to take their
[1:23:26] position within the body and get right
[1:23:28] with God because perhaps it's somebody
[1:23:31] amongst us that's holding this whole
[1:23:33] thing up
[1:23:35] because he cannot come until the last
[1:23:39] one comes in and takes our position.
[1:23:43] He cannot. That's right. You say that's
[1:23:46] a bold statement. It's the truth. That's
[1:23:49] right. because he cannot come until
[1:23:52] every name that was written within that
[1:23:55] little book of redemption
[1:23:59] has come to life and has taken their
[1:24:01] position within the body. And until
[1:24:04] then, he's going to labor and he's going
[1:24:06] to wait and he's going to be patient.
[1:24:09] Hey, let's get our act together. Man,
[1:24:15] that was funny. Brother Chad was talking
[1:24:17] about eating the little book. And I
[1:24:19] won't tell you what one of my boys it
[1:24:21] was. Guess what he started
[1:24:25] doing? Eating a
[1:24:27] book.
[1:24:30] Son, I'm glad you're listening.
[1:24:34] Praise the Lord. But please don't eat
[1:24:37] your book. That's nasty.
[1:24:44] As the musicians come, we'll we'll start
[1:24:46] to wind us down a little bit
[1:24:50] here. We find out that we've reached the
[1:24:52] top of the
[1:24:53] vine and we see that this vine now is
[1:24:58] bringing forth fruit in abundance. We
[1:25:02] see that the sun has brother Brandham
[1:25:04] says that that that the fruit grows on
[1:25:07] top of the tree and the life is in the
[1:25:10] middle of the tree. And what what's
[1:25:11] happening with the sun is it's drawing
[1:25:13] the life out of the vine and now it's
[1:25:16] bringing forth fruit at the top of the
[1:25:18] tree. What for? That it might be used
[1:25:22] for his kingdom's glory. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:25] Now, we could go into the process of
[1:25:26] making wine, but for time's sake, I
[1:25:29] don't want
[1:25:31] to. But this is the hour of the revealed
[1:25:36] word bringing forth the revealed fruit.
[1:25:40] This is the time that the word of this
[1:25:43] hour that it brings forth
[1:25:46] something not just a confession but it
[1:25:50] brings forth a life. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:56] So what does it mean to bear much fruit?
[1:25:58] Because we've been talking about fruit.
[1:26:00] And what is the fruit that we are
[1:26:03] supposed to bear as believers? I want to
[1:26:05] say this. It's more fruit than just
[1:26:08] justification. That's right. It is more
[1:26:11] fruit than just sanctification and
[1:26:14] living a sanctified life, though that is
[1:26:16] good. It is more fruit than just being
[1:26:19] born again.
[1:26:22] But it's beyond that.
[1:26:24] It's onto a place of adoption, of
[1:26:28] authority and power, of believing the
[1:26:30] word in its fullness, that if ye will
[1:26:33] say unto this mountain, "Be removed,"
[1:26:35] and though doubt in your heart, it shall
[1:26:37] be done.
[1:26:39] You say brother that just means a
[1:26:41] symbolic uh it's a symbol. I can believe
[1:26:45] that for the natural I
[1:26:47] [Music]
[1:26:50] hope what is happening
[1:26:53] it's how are we supposed to bring forth
[1:26:56] this fruit and what kind of fruit is it?
[1:26:58] It is it is it is the the power of the
[1:27:02] spoken word.
[1:27:05] It is believing in sure the laying on of
[1:27:08] hands and the preaching of repentance
[1:27:10] and and so on and so forth. It's it's
[1:27:13] it's
[1:27:15] uh believing that the fervent prayer of
[1:27:17] a righteous man avaleth
[1:27:19] much. It's for our sisters to believe
[1:27:24] that it's not right to trim or cut our
[1:27:27] hair. It's a but yet it's not just a
[1:27:30] life of of holiness and dress, but it's
[1:27:33] a it's a daily walk of holiness in
[1:27:37] character. That's right.
[1:27:40] Because if we make this just a closline
[1:27:43] religion, which Brother Brandham did
[1:27:45] preach by the way,
[1:27:49] if but if we just leave it there and we
[1:27:51] miss the character within, we're just
[1:27:54] whited walls. Amen.
[1:27:57] So now what do we believe? We believe in
[1:27:59] having the character of Christ and
[1:28:02] believing for all things and living a
[1:28:04] life of holiness and a a closline
[1:28:06] religion, if I may say that because
[1:28:09] brother Brandham preached it.
[1:28:13] It's believing in
[1:28:15] uh in husbands loving their wives
[1:28:19] as Christ loved the church. It's I'm
[1:28:21] talking about the fruits of this
[1:28:23] message. Amen. It's about wives
[1:28:27] submitting themselves to their own
[1:28:28] husbands. For this is right. It's it's
[1:28:31] about wives respecting their husbands in
[1:28:33] the household. It's about men being men
[1:28:36] and being men of their own household and
[1:28:38] and raising their family in the
[1:28:39] admonition of God. That's the fruit of
[1:28:42] this message. That's true. Wow. Amen. We
[1:28:47] could go on and on and on, but you fill
[1:28:49] in the rest of the blanks. What is the
[1:28:52] fruit of this message?
[1:28:56] at all. When I think of this
[1:28:59] message, there's one thing that comes to
[1:29:01] me and that's rapture.
[1:29:06] Rapture. It's preparing
[1:29:09] us. This word, Brother Brandham, let me
[1:29:12] tell you, he didn't pull no punches.
[1:29:16] He said things and preached
[1:29:19] things that I would be a little
[1:29:22] embarrassed perhaps to say from this
[1:29:25] pulpit. I think there's and this is just
[1:29:28] me. Okay. Is this okay? Amen. I think
[1:29:30] there's certain quotes
[1:29:33] that brother Brandham he speaks
[1:29:35] extremely
[1:29:37] forcefully and directly and a lot of
[1:29:40] times it's towards women and Jezebel and
[1:29:43] so on and so forth. that I think it's
[1:29:46] okay just to let brother Brandham say
[1:29:49] it. Unless you're the pastor of the
[1:29:52] church, then he can say what the prophet
[1:29:54] said. But rest of us ministers, I think
[1:29:57] we should have
[1:29:59] enough respect. Amen. That's a good
[1:30:02] word. enough respect for the people of
[1:30:06] God that there's certain things and
[1:30:08] certain avenues that we just shouldn't
[1:30:10] go down to cuz it's the pastor's place
[1:30:15] and it was the place for the prophet
[1:30:18] cuz I feel a lot of times and I'm not
[1:30:20] talking about anybody in particular. I
[1:30:23] think a lot of times we can especially
[1:30:25] as a
[1:30:26] man and a minister you get up and and
[1:30:29] and read a quote and say it with force
[1:30:32] and but it's not said with love.
[1:30:39] And so it's not taken the right way.
[1:30:42] But if it's spoken in love, I believe
[1:30:45] that God's people can receive it in
[1:30:47] love. Amen. Amen. Very good.
[1:30:51] [Music]
[1:30:52] Galatians
[1:30:54] 5:16-26. This I say then, walk in the
[1:30:57] spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust
[1:30:59] of the flesh. Write it down. Underline
[1:31:02] it. Highlight it. Walk in the spirit.
[1:31:05] You want to overcome the flesh. Walk in
[1:31:08] the spirit. For the flesh lust against
[1:31:11] the spirit, and the spirit against the
[1:31:13] flesh, and these are contrary to one to
[1:31:15] the other, so that you cannot do the
[1:31:17] things that you would.
[1:31:19] But if you be laid of the spirit, you're
[1:31:21] not under the law. Now the works of the
[1:31:23] flesh are manifest. Which are these?
[1:31:25] Adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
[1:31:27] lasciviousness, adultery, idolatry,
[1:31:29] witchcraft, hatred, variance,
[1:31:31] emulations, wrath, strife, seditions,
[1:31:33] heresies, envings, murderers, murders,
[1:31:36] drunkenness, rellings, and such like. of
[1:31:39] the which I tell you before, as I have
[1:31:41] also told you in time past, that they
[1:31:44] which do such things shall not inherit
[1:31:46] the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the
[1:31:49] spirit. You want to see the fruit of the
[1:31:51] spirit, the fruit on the vineyard, the
[1:31:54] fruit that should be upon our the
[1:31:55] vineyard of our life is
[1:31:57] love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:32:01] gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
[1:32:05] and temperance. Against such there is no
[1:32:08] law. And they that are in Christ, that
[1:32:11] are Christs, have crucified the flesh
[1:32:13] with the affections of the lusts. If we
[1:32:15] live in the spirit, let us also walk in
[1:32:18] the spirit. It's a daily life. Let us
[1:32:22] not be desirous of vain glory, provoking
[1:32:25] one another, envying one another.
[1:32:30] The fruit of the spirit is love, joy,
[1:32:33] peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
[1:32:35] meekness,
[1:32:37] temperance. It's the life of the
[1:32:40] believer. It's the life of this
[1:32:44] message. So now I want to ask you the
[1:32:47] question, what condition is your
[1:32:49] vineyard in?
[1:32:52] Is it all tangled up with briars
[1:32:55] and nettles and
[1:32:58] thorns? The wall is broken down and it's
[1:33:01] been a while since you've taken care of
[1:33:02] it and you realize, hey, I'm not
[1:33:05] bringing forth like I should be bringing
[1:33:08] forth in my life. The wonderful thing
[1:33:10] about it is this, that once we recognize
[1:33:13] it, we can change it.
[1:33:16] We can we can get out of bed early
[1:33:19] tomorrow morning. Amen. And we can rise
[1:33:23] even though if you're not a morning
[1:33:25] person and you can rise and get up and
[1:33:28] say, you know what, I'm going to brush
[1:33:30] my teeth and look at my car. I'm going
[1:33:32] to come back inside and I'm going to
[1:33:34] read my Bible. What are you beginning to
[1:33:37] do? You're beginning to clean your
[1:33:40] vineyard. You're beginning to to put
[1:33:43] things in a little bit of order. You're
[1:33:45] you're beginning to to put your
[1:33:47] affections on things above. you're
[1:33:49] beginning to walk in the spirit and
[1:33:51] you'll find if you'll get up and you'll
[1:33:53] put God first
[1:33:56] and then you'll let him be the last
[1:33:58] thing that you think about and pray to
[1:33:59] and talk to in the evening, you'll begin
[1:34:02] to notice your vineyard now will begin
[1:34:04] to blossom
[1:34:07] and it'll be used for the glory of God.
[1:34:10] God bless you. Let's stand together this
[1:34:13] evening.
[1:34:14] Thank you for listening. Thank you for
[1:34:17] coming out to the house of the Lord.
[1:34:18] Thank you for pulling upon the word. I
[1:34:21] It was good. I enjoyed it. I was
[1:34:24] nervous. I thought, "Oh man, this is
[1:34:26] going to be a
[1:34:27] wreck. Everybody's going to be tired."
[1:34:30] And how can I follow Brother Chad and
[1:34:32] Brother Jason? And you know, Brother Ron
[1:34:36] said, "Just go with it, man." Amen. I
[1:34:38] said, "Thank you, brother Ron. It really
[1:34:39] helped me." And so, here we are.
[1:34:44] husbandmen, keepers of the
[1:34:47] vineyard. How about we start from
[1:34:49] tonight onwards and we say, "Father,
[1:34:51] yeah, there's a few things in there it
[1:34:53] doesn't belong there, but tonight I am I
[1:34:56] am going to say that I'm cleaning it up.
[1:34:59] I'm going to put it back in order now.
[1:35:01] Come, Lord, because unless the rain
[1:35:04] comes, which is the Holy Spirit, and you
[1:35:08] water the ground that I'm trying to take
[1:35:10] care of, I can't bring forth fruit. So,
[1:35:13] Father, let's pray together. Father, I
[1:35:16] ask tonight in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:35:18] that your Holy Spirit would fall upon
[1:35:21] each life, upon each heart, upon each
[1:35:24] vineyard, Lord. And Father, may it cause
[1:35:26] a a stir in our lives, Father God. and
[1:35:30] may it cause a a time of bringing forth
[1:35:33] much fruit in our lives. I ask it for
[1:35:36] thy kingdom's glory in the name of Jesus
[1:35:39] Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:35:42] Hallelujah. Let's sing this song
[1:35:44] together. Jesus. To be like

[1:36:26] journey from earth to

[1:38:54] me. If that's your desire, just lift
[1:38:57] your hand.

[1:40:23] control. Do you believe that, Amen? He's

[1:40:32] control. Put that
[1:40:37] reassur down in my soul.
[1:40:44] He's got it all in control. Aren't you
[1:40:48] thankful for that this evening? My
[1:40:50] father knows what I need. My father
[1:40:53] knows what I
[1:40:57] need.
[1:40:59] Yes. My father knows what I
[1:41:06] need. In everything I go through, he
[1:41:11] knows what's best for me.
[1:41:16] me. My father knows what I need. I put
[1:41:22] my life in his
[1:41:24] hands. I put my life in his
[1:41:32] hands. I put my life in his hands.
[1:41:40] So every road I walk down, I'm sure it's
[1:41:45] in his
[1:41:50] plan. I've put my life in his
[1:41:55] hands. Amen. Brother Matthew Aaron, if
