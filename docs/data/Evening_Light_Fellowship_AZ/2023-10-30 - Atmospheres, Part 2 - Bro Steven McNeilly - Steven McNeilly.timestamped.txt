[42:25] moment this morning God bless you it's
[42:28] good to be in the house of the Lord this
[42:30] morning amen and uh we bring you
[42:33] greetings there from Elf Youth and
[42:37] Flagstaff and we just we had a really
[42:40] nice time we've we've been doing this
[42:42] annually where we'll uh brother Ron will
[42:45] rent us a cabin up there in Flagstaff
[42:47] and we all just get together for three
[42:49] or four days and and just en enjoy each
[42:52] other's company and um we did think
[42:56] things a little bit different this year
[42:58] and they're all streaming this morning
[42:59] so we say God bless you richly um we did
[43:03] something a little different this year
[43:05] we had some of the youth um the youth
[43:08] boys take the
[43:10] services and so we asked six or seven of
[43:13] the young men on Friday night we had
[43:16] brother Justice Wallace and he spoke on
[43:19] letting go of things and opening up more
[43:23] doors in our hearts and uh it was very
[43:26] very good brother brandham preaches this
[43:28] service uh doors in a door and he says
[43:31] within your heart there's many doors
[43:33] within your heart and unless you open
[43:35] those doors and make God welcome uh uh
[43:39] those he he talks about opening those
[43:41] doors up and saying father here's my
[43:43] issues come in and dwell and take care
[43:46] of these issues um so it was excellent
[43:49] Matthew Aon he spoke on it's never too
[43:52] late to rebuild and he took his
[43:55] scripture from from the book of Nehemiah
[43:57] there and it was just excellent
[44:00] everybody did an excellent job I could I
[44:03] could preach a sermon on each one of
[44:05] their thoughts of what they did and it
[44:08] was very interesting to see how that
[44:11] each one kind of dovetailed one with
[44:15] another uh brother Nicholas yeski he he
[44:20] gave his testimony he wanted to make
[44:22] sure that everybody knew that God moved
[44:24] him out here for a purpose
[44:32] and so then we had breakfast Saturday
[44:34] morning and then we had a little time of
[44:36] devotion Saturday around 10:00 and
[44:39] brother Elias pagee he spoke on change
[44:42] changing your habits and your morning
[44:46] routines um brother Jonathan McGary
[44:49] spoke after him he said ye are the light
[44:52] of the world go forth and Shine Your
[44:54] Light and um um there was a a quote that
[44:58] he used where brother brandham said that
[45:00] you are God's
[45:01] Billboards and so you know afterwards I
[45:04] asked the question I said what is your
[45:06] billboard showing this morning and um
[45:09] just everything was excellent and the
[45:11] last but not least was brother Emmanuel
[45:14] bya and he spoke on prayer and so we
[45:17] could we were just very very happy and
[45:20] very pleased and we are so proud of our
[45:23] youth group um it's very interest
[45:25] interesting I remember being in the
[45:27] youth group and um you know all these
[45:30] guys wanted to do not to mention any
[45:32] names Justin dubsky and they love all
[45:34] boys and you know uh all they wanted to
[45:37] do was play volleyball and and sports
[45:40] and stuff and and uh and that was fine
[45:44] um I would rather play soccer than
[45:46] volleyball but that was just me um but
[45:49] it's amazing to see the Dynamics how the
[45:51] youth group changes Friday night there
[45:54] was two of the boys uh brother Titus um
[45:59] Franklin and Michael you know Michael
[46:01] who comes and sings he's a relation to
[46:03] the bi so both of these boys are like
[46:06] Semi-Pro chess players and so here we
[46:09] are midnight Friday night and there's
[46:12] just I don't know 20 25 of the young
[46:15] people are gathered around just
[46:18] mesmerized watching these guys play
[46:20] chess and I thought this is amazing the
[46:23] volleyball net isn't even set up they're
[46:25] hardly even playing any sports and here
[46:26] we are mesmerized by a chess game and uh
[46:30] and so it's just it's just neat to see
[46:33] the change and and how the Dynamics
[46:36] change within a group but we are just so
[46:38] proud of them and their stand and their
[46:41] uh uh that they take for the Lord Jesus
[46:44] in this hour stand with me if you would
[46:46] thank you
[46:47] musicians turn with me in your Bible to
[46:50] the Book of Mark chapter
[46:53] 13 and we'll read verses 5 through
[47:07] 8 hallelujah
[47:11] amen verse 5 of chapter 13 it says and
[47:15] Jesus answering them began to say take
[47:18] heed lest any man deceive you for many
[47:22] shall come in my name saying I am Christ
[47:24] and shall deceive
[47:26] many and when ye shall hear of wars and
[47:29] rumors of
[47:31] wars be really scared and hide yourself
[47:34] in a
[47:37] closet that's not what it says it says
[47:40] be ye not
[47:42] troubled for such things must needs be
[47:46] but the end shall not be yet for nation
[47:50] shall rise against nation and Kingdom
[47:52] against Kingdom and there shall be
[47:54] earthquakes and in diverse places and
[47:57] there shall be famines and troubles
[48:00] these are the beginning of Sorrows amen
[48:04] let's pray together father we certainly
[48:07] love you and we are thankful for an
[48:10] another opportunity that we can come
[48:13] Lord and we can hear your word father
[48:15] for it's the desire of a Believer to
[48:18] hear your word it's a desire of the
[48:21] believer that your word would have an
[48:23] effect on our lives Lord and so I'm
[48:25] asking that you would come by sweetly
[48:27] this morning and speak to our hearts
[48:30] take the word multiply it Lord and feed
[48:32] our souls we ask you would meet the
[48:35] different needs within the assembly be
[48:37] with the youth and Flagstaff father
[48:39] father and as they drive down on the
[48:41] road there I pray that you would keep
[48:43] every one of them safe Lord we ask it
[48:46] for thy Kingdom's glory in the name of
[48:48] Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated
[48:51] this
[48:54] morning
[48:56] I would like to title my sermon this
[48:59] morning and continue on this thought on
[49:01] atmospheres this is atmospher part two
[49:05] and when we last spoke on this we spoke
[49:08] on the import of the atmosphere uh we
[49:12] spoke on the important of the atmosphere
[49:14] around the earth and that how that
[49:16] without the atmosphere around the earth
[49:19] just to put very plainly and very simply
[49:23] where the Earth would not be inhabitable
[49:26] it's it it protects us from the Sun it
[49:28] protects us from many different things
[49:31] in our galaxy and so without the right
[49:34] kind of atmosphere surrounding our
[49:37] Natural Earth it would be extremely bad
[49:40] for this planet and so we spoke on the
[49:43] same thing with our natural uh body as
[49:48] as a Believer and and our and our
[49:51] spiritual lives that it's extremely
[49:53] important for us to always remember to
[49:57] keep the right atmosphere around us not
[50:00] only to keep the right atmosphere around
[50:03] us as we are in church and as we are
[50:06] amongst one another uh fellowshipping
[50:09] with Believers but having the right
[50:11] atmosphere in our homes having the right
[50:14] atmosphere on our jobs having the right
[50:16] atmosphere with whoever it is that we
[50:18] come and contact with it is vitally
[50:21] important for us to remember to keep the
[50:24] right atmosphere
[50:26] because it is so easy so easy for us
[50:30] Believers to get into the wrong
[50:32] atmosphere and when we are in the wrong
[50:34] kind of atmosphere it produces the wrong
[50:38] kind of results but when we are um when
[50:41] we realize it and we and and we say
[50:44] father now at this moment cuz guess what
[50:48] it's going to
[50:50] happen there' be times in our day in our
[50:53] week in our months in the year that
[50:55] guess what but we are going to be in the
[50:57] wrong kind of atmosphere but the good
[51:00] thing is is that we don't have to stay
[51:03] in that wrong atmosphere but we can make
[51:05] a very a a very good choice and say
[51:08] father the atmosphere that's surrounding
[51:10] me right now is is not the greatest it's
[51:13] not producing very good results Lord
[51:16] here I am change my
[51:19] atmosphere because brother brandham said
[51:21] that the right kind of atmosphere
[51:23] produces the right kind of
[51:26] results
[51:28] amen so we realize that when a seed goes
[51:32] into the ground we know that in order
[51:35] for a seed to bring forth of its full
[51:38] potential that it has to have a a few
[51:41] things surrounding it it has to have the
[51:43] right kind of soil it has to have the
[51:45] right kind of water and moisture and it
[51:48] has to have enough sunlight in order for
[51:51] the seed to bring forth of the full
[51:54] potential that lays Within
[51:56] it now but if this seed is planted in
[52:02] the wrong kind of atmosphere we realize
[52:05] that it will never bring forth of its
[52:08] full potential of what lays within that
[52:12] seed now we can we can even though it
[52:16] has soil even though it has moisture and
[52:20] even though it's getting sunlight if the
[52:23] atmosphere is wrong it's not going to
[52:25] grow
[52:27] right for instance we can talk on the
[52:31] cactus here in Arizona and we realize
[52:34] that um the cactus here it it it does
[52:39] very well and it grows very well and it
[52:42] lives well here because the atmosphere
[52:45] around it is the right kind of
[52:47] Atmosphere for that seed to grow now if
[52:50] you were to take that same seed or or or
[52:53] a bush or some kind of shrub that grows
[52:56] well here in the desert and you go ahead
[52:58] and you put it in the High Country you
[53:00] put it in a place where it's really cold
[53:02] you put it in a place where it's where
[53:04] it gets a lot of moisture where it gets
[53:06] a lot of rain and these different things
[53:08] it'll never produce the same as it does
[53:11] as it as here in the valley why because
[53:14] the atmosphere is wrong even though it's
[53:17] planted in a in a soil even though it
[53:20] gets the sunlight even though it gets a
[53:22] little bit of moisture but too much of
[53:24] one thing it'll cause it not to grow
[53:27] correctly now think
[53:30] spiritual because God wants us to always
[53:34] he wants us to bring forth the full
[53:36] potential that lays within the seed that
[53:39] he's placed within our hearts but
[53:42] understand it's up to us to make sure
[53:44] that the atmosphere surrounding that
[53:46] seed is correct otherwise it'll never
[53:50] bring forth to its full
[53:52] potential oh it might bring forth a
[53:54] little bit bit it might bring forth the
[53:56] Bible says some 30 and some 60 whatever
[54:00] it is but we want to bring forth 100
[54:06] fold you can take a tree up in the North
[54:09] Country there up in the cold up in the
[54:12] hills take the seed bring it down to the
[54:15] valley plant it I'm going to have a
[54:18] beautiful massive tree and this tree and
[54:22] the fall is going to lose its lose its
[54:24] leaves and it's going to be beautiful
[54:25] fall colors cuz we never get that in the
[54:29] desert ain't going to
[54:31] happen why because the atmosphere isn't
[54:37] right
[54:40] Hallelujah so we find out that God now
[54:43] placed the seed within the Earth and
[54:46] that certain seed is supposed to bring
[54:48] forth at a certain degreed time a
[54:51] certain season so a seed of God that was
[54:55] planted to come forth in smia would
[54:58] never come forth in laiaa and a seed of
[55:02] God that was to come forth in laiaa
[55:05] wouldn't come forth in another church
[55:07] age why because the atmosphere wasn't
[55:11] right though it's a seed though it's
[55:14] been planted in the ground but yet the
[55:17] atmosphere isn't the same for that seed
[55:19] to bring
[55:20] forth let me say this a seed in these
[55:23] other Church ages that that have went
[55:25] before us they wouldn't flourish like
[55:29] you flourish in this age and you say oh
[55:33] my I I feel like I'm a son or a daughter
[55:36] and I'm born out of due season no you're
[55:38] not you're born exactly at the right
[55:41] time that God wanted you to come here
[55:45] why because he has a purpose for you and
[55:47] for your
[55:50] life yeah you could have come forth when
[55:53] the horse and buggy and all that stuff
[55:54] and they were farmers and you know
[55:56] everything was great there's nobody
[55:58] chasing you off your land nobody trying
[56:01] to steal your
[56:03] crops because that's what we think isn't
[56:05] it everything in other days gone by it
[56:07] was just easy it was easy to make a
[56:09] living it was easy to grow a crop oh
[56:14] my I'm sure they had their
[56:18] struggles but if you were to come forth
[56:20] at that time you would never bring forth
[56:23] the fruit that you are now because it
[56:25] wasn't the right atmosphere for that
[56:28] seed to bring
[56:30] forth
[56:38] hallelujah what happens is with us
[56:41] we we find out
[56:44] that God has has a plan for
[56:49] us and he has a purpose for us and that
[56:52] purpose is is not for us to to live for
[56:57] ourselves it's not for us to be selfish
[56:59] and to think only of ourselves but it's
[57:02] for us to say father let thy will be
[57:06] done in this Earth as it is in heaven
[57:11] now in order to do that first off we've
[57:14] got to Humble ourselves because we all
[57:17] have desires we all have wants we all
[57:20] have places that we want to go and
[57:22] things that we want to do but before we
[57:25] choose those things we should be saying
[57:27] father what would you want me to do
[57:33] amen God knows everything about you he
[57:38] does brother brandham would say in his
[57:40] Services he would say God knows where
[57:43] you came from who you are he knew where
[57:46] you would be sitting and the Very
[57:48] clothes that you would be wearing right
[57:50] here today in this service now if God
[57:54] know knows all of those things don't you
[57:57] think that God knows the needs that's in
[58:00] our lives don't you think that God knows
[58:03] the things that we are in need of he's
[58:06] just wanting us to ask the problem is
[58:09] that when we ask we get
[58:13] impatient the problem is is that when we
[58:16] ask and it doesn't come to pass as we
[58:19] think it should come to pass guess what
[58:21] happens we get
[58:23] discouraged well God hasn't heard my
[58:26] prayer God God doesn't answer my prayer
[58:30] this hasn't come to pass why is this
[58:32] happening why am I going through this
[58:34] I've asked for deliverance whatever it
[58:36] may be
[58:37] why we get
[58:39] impatient and when we get impatient we
[58:42] get discouraged and when you get
[58:44] discouraged you want to
[58:48] quit God help us because God's ways are
[58:53] so much above our ways that's right I
[58:56] remember one time it just comes to my
[58:58] mind I was uh I don't know 12 years old
[59:02] and so when I grew up in Ireland we
[59:04] lived in in a in a in a it was like a
[59:07] council house or whatever and um it's
[59:09] kind of where the poor people live right
[59:12] and um all these detached houses and
[59:14] stuff and and it's taller than it is
[59:17] wide and everything and that's just how
[59:18] I grew up that's okay but when I when I
[59:21] come of age and I begin to realize it I
[59:23] thought my goodness
[59:25] my friends they they live in a bungalow
[59:28] and bung over there you live in a
[59:30] bungalow your mom and dad's doing pretty
[59:32] good and H you're probably more middle
[59:34] class and I remembered standing at my
[59:37] window every night my grandma lived
[59:39] right across the street from us and so
[59:41] every night I'd turn the light on and
[59:42] off on and off cuz I could see her
[59:45] through her window I could see her
[59:46] sitting watching TV and so I'd always
[59:47] wave at her I wave good night
[59:51] right and it just something me and my
[59:53] grandma did it was nice and um and so I
[59:56] remember standing there one time and I
[59:58] thought my goodness I I hate living in
[1:00:01] this house and this this thing and
[1:00:04] everything I want to live in a
[1:00:06] bungalow and I said it and I thought I
[1:00:09] thought I want to live in a
[1:00:10] bungalow it was the desire of my heart
[1:00:14] and I didn't know I was what I was doing
[1:00:16] I was just saying it probably more out
[1:00:18] of frustration and
[1:00:19] pride well what what happened in my life
[1:00:22] after that was from 14
[1:00:25] through 16 got caught up in in in a
[1:00:28] bunch of stuff that I shouldn't have
[1:00:30] gotten caught up in with uh um and so I
[1:00:33] would have I would have people that
[1:00:35] would that would follow my school bus to
[1:00:37] my house I I went to school in a
[1:00:39] different town and these guys would be
[1:00:41] calling the other people on the bus
[1:00:43] we're going to get them we're going to
[1:00:44] get them and we're going to kill them I
[1:00:46] thought oh my goodness but I was too
[1:00:48] smart they could never catch
[1:00:51] me there's a time to fight and there's a
[1:00:54] time to to run
[1:00:57] man guess I had some wisdom when I was
[1:01:00] younger just like us there's a time to
[1:01:03] say something to somebody and there's a
[1:01:05] time just to keep her mouth shut wisdom
[1:01:08] father give us more
[1:01:12] wisdom so here here I was and and and
[1:01:15] things got so bad that we did the
[1:01:17] midnight move they'd be driving by our
[1:01:20] house and they'd be there's all sorts of
[1:01:22] bad stuff that was going on I was just a
[1:01:24] kid what happened was I got caught up
[1:01:26] with the wrong
[1:01:28] people got caught up with the wrong
[1:01:30] gangs got caught up with the wrong
[1:01:32] influences guys choose your friends
[1:01:36] wisely because if you choose the wrong
[1:01:38] kind of friends they'll take you to the
[1:01:40] wrong kind of places and then they'll
[1:01:42] bring that stuff around your house and
[1:01:45] nobody wants that and so we did the
[1:01:47] midnight move we moved to another town
[1:01:50] guess what kind of house we moved into a
[1:01:53] bungalow
[1:01:57] I say all that to say this I didn't know
[1:01:59] what I was asking for and sometimes we
[1:02:03] ask God for things in our lives and we
[1:02:07] ask God for a Deliverance or we ask God
[1:02:09] for patience or whatever it might be and
[1:02:12] next thing we know our lives get changed
[1:02:14] and get turned upside down and we think
[1:02:19] why is this happening because God has
[1:02:21] taken you to a place that you desired
[1:02:24] yeah but you think and you prayed for it
[1:02:27] and you look at it and you say this is
[1:02:29] not what I
[1:02:33] expected so we have to be careful
[1:02:36] sometimes and we have to realize that
[1:02:38] God
[1:02:41] knows he knows what he's doing he knows
[1:02:45] what he's going to do and he knows
[1:02:47] exactly where we are at we just have to
[1:02:50] be
[1:02:53] patient he
[1:02:56] amen a lot of times when we pray we
[1:02:58] think that God doesn't hear our prayers
[1:03:02] Revelation 5:8 says and when he had
[1:03:05] taken the book The Four beasts and four
[1:03:06] and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb
[1:03:09] having every one of them Harps and
[1:03:10] golden vials full of odors what were
[1:03:13] these odors they were the prayer of the
[1:03:18] Saints understand in our carnal man and
[1:03:21] our and our in our flesh man in our
[1:03:24] emotions and our feelings and and all
[1:03:26] these different things that we see taste
[1:03:28] feel smell and hear that's what we uh
[1:03:31] that's what we judge our prayers off of
[1:03:33] if they've been answered or not well I I
[1:03:36] haven't seen anything things have
[1:03:38] actually gotten worse I I didn't feel
[1:03:41] anything it seems like disguise or brass
[1:03:43] and I can't pray through and I can't do
[1:03:45] this and this happens but yet there's a
[1:03:48] v that's full of odors of the prayer
[1:03:53] Saints what is it that's happening to us
[1:03:56] God and brother brother Ron has said it
[1:03:58] multitudes of times that God is weaning
[1:04:01] us away weaning us away from our
[1:04:04] emotions and Sensations and and our
[1:04:07] feelings and what we think and what we
[1:04:09] taste and see and he's weaning us away
[1:04:12] those things that we might walk by faith
[1:04:14] before
[1:04:16] God all we got to do is look at is look
[1:04:19] at Daniel in the Bible and and I stole
[1:04:23] this from Brother Danel this was so good
[1:04:26] when Daniel began to pray to God it
[1:04:28] seemed like the answer was always on its
[1:04:31] way when he would pray the answer was
[1:04:33] there and and that was him as a as a
[1:04:36] newborn babe in Christ but he got to a a
[1:04:39] place in his life where where he was
[1:04:41] troubled in his spirit and he was
[1:04:43] troubled within his
[1:04:44] mind and so he prayed to the same God
[1:04:49] but nothing changed he prayed to the
[1:04:52] same God but there was no answer he
[1:04:54] prayed to the same God and he was still
[1:04:57] troubled he was still caught up with
[1:05:00] with the with the with the his
[1:05:02] surroundings and the things that was
[1:05:03] troubling him until 21 days
[1:05:06] later there was an angel that came and
[1:05:09] visited with Daniel and what did the
[1:05:11] angel say to him your prayer was heard
[1:05:15] from the very first day from the very
[1:05:17] time that you spoke it that that prayer
[1:05:20] left the lips of your mouth God heard
[1:05:22] that prayer but there was a messenger of
[1:05:25] Satan that was sent and he hindered me
[1:05:29] but God hears your prayers and so it is
[1:05:31] with us we get so caught up with our
[1:05:34] emotions and Sensations and looking at
[1:05:37] our at the things that are surrounding
[1:05:39] us that we fail to remember that God
[1:05:42] hears and answers prayers it might not
[1:05:45] be how we expect it to be but the
[1:05:49] outcome Hallelujah the outcome will be
[1:05:52] right that's right amen
[1:05:56] thank you Lord amen sometimes we say
[1:05:58] father get a hold of our
[1:06:01] children I wonder if father God has to
[1:06:04] take our children
[1:06:06] sometimes and put them through the
[1:06:08] ringer once in a
[1:06:10] while for them to be completely on their
[1:06:13] back to realize there's only one place I
[1:06:15] can look and that's up
[1:06:18] amen God can take our friends away from
[1:06:21] us and let us in a big church feel like
[1:06:24] we are
[1:06:25] friendless I got no friends you got no
[1:06:27] friends and you're in a big church yeah
[1:06:30] sometimes God has to get us to a place
[1:06:31] like that for us to turn our eyes to
[1:06:37] him
[1:06:41] Hallelujah the Bible says that the
[1:06:44] fervent prayer of a righteous man it
[1:06:48] avails much the word Avail it means to
[1:06:52] be strong it means means to have force
[1:06:55] it means to Avail it means to be whole
[1:06:58] and as I as I read those those those
[1:07:01] meanings of ath I thought to myself to
[1:07:05] me the word Avail it means to have an
[1:07:10] impact it's strong it's forceful it it
[1:07:15] it avails it's whole it it's impactful
[1:07:18] so what is it when a when the prayer of
[1:07:20] a righteous man whenever he prays for a
[1:07:23] certain situation what is it it's
[1:07:25] forceful it has an impact on situations
[1:07:29] and that's why brother Brandon would say
[1:07:30] that Prayer Changes
[1:07:34] Things it has an impact on situations it
[1:07:38] has an impact on people's
[1:07:40] lives
[1:07:42] amen
[1:07:46] hallelujah God has not called us to walk
[1:07:50] by the things that we feel he has not
[1:07:53] called us to walk walk by our five sens
[1:07:56] the five Sensations within our within
[1:07:58] our bodies see tastes feel smell and
[1:08:00] hear they to contact our Earthly
[1:08:05] home guess what they're carnal amen and
[1:08:09] they're enmity with
[1:08:11] God but God now is through this message
[1:08:15] of the hour God is Not only calling us
[1:08:18] to walk by faith but God has called us
[1:08:21] to walk by A Perfect
[1:08:26] faith not just simple Faith but a faith
[1:08:30] that is perfect in all its ways listen
[1:08:34] to this perfect Faith
[1:08:37] 1963 brother brandham says this is
[1:08:39] coming into that third pool I'm
[1:08:42] believing it now I want to ask you a
[1:08:45] sincere question you that passed through
[1:08:47] the prayer line can you actually believe
[1:08:48] and feel now that something happened to
[1:08:50] you since his hands are laid on you he
[1:08:54] said there it is this is what we've
[1:08:55] waited for this is just starting to
[1:08:57] bloom now see I did this for a purpose I
[1:09:00] did this for I'm working out something
[1:09:03] see it's taking this charge of faith and
[1:09:06] going right back to begin and come in
[1:09:08] see to kind of raise faith in a bracket
[1:09:12] where you've never noticed it that way
[1:09:14] before now if you're to listen to the
[1:09:17] sermon brother brandham talks about
[1:09:20] perfect faith and he's relating it to
[1:09:23] the speaking of squirrels into
[1:09:27] existence he says uh not a faith but a
[1:09:32] perfect Faith he says build it up in
[1:09:35] here and watch a perfect god with a
[1:09:38] perfect heart keep a perfect Promise by
[1:09:41] his perfect word which is sharper than
[1:09:44] any two- AED sword and a discerner of
[1:09:47] the thoughts of the heart we are coming
[1:09:49] now to the
[1:09:51] Perfection because the people has to
[1:09:54] come to this in order for the Rapture so
[1:09:59] now he's bringing us just from a simple
[1:10:01] Faith he said now it's going to take a
[1:10:04] perfect faith in order for the Rapture
[1:10:08] to
[1:10:09] happen he said that's what's holding it
[1:10:12] away right now is waiting for that
[1:10:14] church to come into that perfect
[1:10:17] raptured Faith what is the only thing
[1:10:21] that is holding the coming of the Lord
[1:10:24] right now where we live is because the
[1:10:26] church hasn't got to a place of perfect
[1:10:29] faith yet
[1:10:32] amen he says looking for it now how do
[1:10:36] we get this perfect faith it means a lot
[1:10:39] of Shaving down for me it means a lot
[1:10:42] for you but together we'll make it by
[1:10:46] the grace of God
[1:10:49] Amen so now he's bringing us to a place
[1:10:52] of Perfection a place of maturity and
[1:10:57] he's saying uh uh how can we get to that
[1:11:00] place of perfection well let me let me
[1:11:03] just share something with you that you
[1:11:04] already know it's because the seals have
[1:11:07] been loosed off the book and now this
[1:11:10] book that was once closed to the people
[1:11:13] has now been opened before our wondering
[1:11:17] eyes and as we are partaking of this
[1:11:20] open book it is bringing us word by word
[1:11:24] line upon line precept upon precept from
[1:11:28] Faith to a perfect Faith but he said is
[1:11:31] going to take a shaving
[1:11:35] down first of all he puts himself in
[1:11:38] that category and then he says a shaving
[1:11:40] down for me and a shaving down for you
[1:11:44] amen I wonder what it is in our lives
[1:11:48] that we have to shave
[1:11:50] off what is it in our lives that brother
[1:11:53] brandom is talking about as going to
[1:11:55] take a shaving down as going to take a
[1:11:58] life of sincerity I I need to be more
[1:12:01] sincere with the word that God is giving
[1:12:05] me let me ask you the question because
[1:12:08] the answer is different for us as
[1:12:11] individuals what is it in your life and
[1:12:13] I ask myself the same question what is
[1:12:16] it in your life that needs shaved
[1:12:20] off what is it in your life that you
[1:12:22] could say you know what
[1:12:24] ah this thing I really I really don't
[1:12:27] need this thing right
[1:12:28] now it's kind of heavy it's a little
[1:12:32] tight I don't feel free in it should I
[1:12:36] take off my tie as
[1:12:39] well there's miles is
[1:12:45] like I'll leave it on Miles told me
[1:12:48] so but what is it in our lives in our
[1:12:50] natural lives that God is telling you
[1:12:54] and you know it that it needs shaved off
[1:12:59] it needs to be taken off you need to
[1:13:01] release it because guess what God will
[1:13:04] never take it from us but we have to
[1:13:06] take it
[1:13:07] ourselves and give it over take care of
[1:13:10] this for me I didn't even have to ask
[1:13:13] brother Robert he was right there that's
[1:13:16] how God is when you take a step towards
[1:13:19] God guess what God will take two steps
[1:13:21] towards you and you don't have to worry
[1:13:23] about where it goes I don't have to
[1:13:25] worry about my jacket anymore because
[1:13:27] brother Robert took care of it whenever
[1:13:29] you shave the things of the world off of
[1:13:32] Our Lives guess what we don't have to
[1:13:34] worry about it anymore we don't have to
[1:13:36] worry about where it goes we don't have
[1:13:38] to worry about anything about it why
[1:13:39] because God takes care of it Lord but
[1:13:44] there's no way brother Robert would come
[1:13:46] up and just try to take my jacket off of
[1:13:48] me it wouldn't be right it wouldn't be
[1:13:52] the right time to to do
[1:13:54] it God does the same thing with
[1:13:57] us he doesn't just come up and take this
[1:13:59] thing off of us and say you don't need
[1:14:01] this I'm going to take it from you no no
[1:14:03] no no God Waits until you're ready God
[1:14:05] Waits until it's your time until you say
[1:14:07] father I am sick and tired of this thing
[1:14:09] that that's got me all bound up and I'm
[1:14:12] I'm always struggling with it and all
[1:14:13] these different things father take
[1:14:17] it I need to preach without a jacket on
[1:14:19] in
[1:14:20] future feels good
[1:14:29] what has happened with the opening of
[1:14:30] this
[1:14:31] word God is making his will known onto
[1:14:38] us the will has been read by the
[1:14:43] executive did I pronounce that
[1:14:46] right to all the parties that have been
[1:14:50] involved in the death of the testator
[1:14:53] yes and understand that brother brandham
[1:14:56] he was the one that took this
[1:14:58] book who was announced by God he said
[1:15:02] hey you're the executive of this will
[1:15:06] now open it up and to everybody that's a
[1:15:10] partaker of this will to everybody who
[1:15:13] has their names that are written down
[1:15:15] within this book I want you to preach it
[1:15:17] to them I want you to preach what
[1:15:19] belongs to them I want I want you to
[1:15:22] tell them what is rightfully theirs
[1:15:25] because I put their name there
[1:15:28] hallelujah we're living too much below
[1:15:30] our privileges my brother and my sister
[1:15:33] and the reason is because we haven't
[1:15:35] been shaven off we haven't been loosing
[1:15:38] off the things that so easily besets
[1:15:43] us your name is in
[1:15:46] there that behold by my stripes ye are
[1:15:50] healed Hallelujah your name is in in
[1:15:53] there that if you cuz that's Faith but
[1:15:56] now watch the perfect Faith behold if
[1:16:00] you say to this mountain be removed and
[1:16:03] you don't doubt it in your heart it'll
[1:16:05] be done as thou Hast
[1:16:10] said your name is written there it's
[1:16:15] yours why because God placed it there
[1:16:18] praise the Lord I say father May Faith
[1:16:22] arise
[1:16:23] to a place of maturity to a place of
[1:16:26] we're not depending upon uh if we felt
[1:16:29] something or not no a perfect faith and
[1:16:33] a perfect God and knowing that God hears
[1:16:36] our prayers from the very time that we
[1:16:38] pray it from the very time that we speak
[1:16:41] it it's in those those vials those odors
[1:16:44] it's a sweet smelling
[1:16:46] Savor in the nostrils of
[1:16:50] God but he's wanting us to shave off
[1:16:54] that we might walk in maturity and in
[1:16:58] Perfection
[1:17:01] Hallelujah brother brandham said that we
[1:17:04] are all little creators and that we have
[1:17:08] the ability to change and to create the
[1:17:10] atmospheres around us follow with me in
[1:17:13] this sermon love and this is this is
[1:17:16] quite a a lengthy um quote here but just
[1:17:19] bear with
[1:17:20] me he says and if you'll learn to to
[1:17:23] love and to be kind to everybody and to
[1:17:26] be gentle he said have patience it'll
[1:17:30] even make your home life
[1:17:34] different so what is if we read what
[1:17:37] he's saying we could say if I learn to
[1:17:39] be gentle and have patience and to and
[1:17:43] to be kind to everybody in my
[1:17:47] household it'll make the home life a
[1:17:50] little different how easy it is for us
[1:17:53] to treat everybody else nice and gentle
[1:17:55] and kind but yet when it comes to our
[1:17:57] own
[1:17:58] families seems like we're
[1:18:01] just it's complete
[1:18:05] opposite father help
[1:18:08] us that's because they're
[1:18:10] family can choose can choose your
[1:18:13] friends but you can't choose your family
[1:18:14] you're stuck with me no matter how how
[1:18:17] bad I treat you but then we wonder why
[1:18:20] the the atmosphere in the home isn't
[1:18:23] where it should be guess what it starts
[1:18:25] somewhere and it starts with us as
[1:18:27] little creators and brother Brenham said
[1:18:29] if we'll be patient and kind to those
[1:18:32] around us it'll change the
[1:18:37] atmosphere he says it'll make your
[1:18:40] associations different God will honor
[1:18:43] you now I've tried it he's speaking by
[1:18:46] experience he said here some time ago in
[1:18:49] my home you can imagine what kind of a
[1:18:50] turmoil it's in all the time you just
[1:18:52] just think well the people say like here
[1:18:55] this little city what about the people
[1:18:57] from around the world see they're flying
[1:18:59] in coming in calling in all the time
[1:19:01] hotels motels sitting full of people
[1:19:04] crying and begging and you can't get a
[1:19:07] minute's
[1:19:08] rest what a life this man
[1:19:13] lived he said one day our house had been
[1:19:15] completely torn up all day
[1:19:19] long now I know none of your houses have
[1:19:22] ever been like that I know for sure my
[1:19:24] house has never been like that it's just
[1:19:27] with five kids it's never like that
[1:19:30] doesn't
[1:19:31] happen
[1:19:36] liar I just love how the prophet of God
[1:19:39] is so
[1:19:40] honest because in his honesty it is so
[1:19:45] relatable that I can say my goodness
[1:19:49] I've been there
[1:19:51] myself
[1:19:53] ashlin's probably like shut up
[1:19:55] Stephen be
[1:19:58] quiet listen to him the basement had
[1:20:01] been full every room full the den room
[1:20:04] full along about dark I got them kind of
[1:20:07] quiet anded down everybody away I
[1:20:10] thought and I went into the kitchen
[1:20:12] there stood my poor little wife at 37
[1:20:14] years old I'm 35 years old few years
[1:20:18] older than me completely gray-headed
[1:20:20] holding her hands up crying she said
[1:20:23] Billy I'm just about to lose my
[1:20:26] mind understand she wasn't only trying
[1:20:29] to raise her little kids but she was
[1:20:31] dealing with all kinds of other people
[1:20:33] and Spirits within their
[1:20:37] home these children hasn't had a bite to
[1:20:40] eat all day long had some nervous people
[1:20:43] there in mental cases and some of them
[1:20:45] walking up and down the floor telling me
[1:20:47] that the Lord is going to strike me dead
[1:20:49] if I didn't go to a certain Town cuz
[1:20:52] they said
[1:20:54] so can you imagine and that's the kind
[1:20:57] you have to put it all together another
[1:21:00] one and another room saying oh oh he
[1:21:03] don't know what he's talking about I
[1:21:05] tell you if that was my house get out of
[1:21:08] my house you come here for help and you
[1:21:12] come here from prayer you come here to
[1:21:14] get healed and here you are saying all
[1:21:17] this stuff about me go stand
[1:21:20] outside but yet the prophet was so
[1:21:22] patient and so gentle and so kind with
[1:21:26] everybody that he came in contact
[1:21:29] with he set the bar so
[1:21:36] high uh another one oh he don't know
[1:21:39] what he's talking about I got thus
[1:21:41] sayith the Lord if the Lord wanted me to
[1:21:43] know anything he would tell me he's not
[1:21:46] afraid to talk to me but you have to put
[1:21:48] up with that
[1:21:49] sometime and she said I don't know what
[1:21:52] to do well look there sat Sarah and
[1:21:55] Becky Becky in the floor fussing over
[1:21:57] some little blocks little bitty building
[1:21:59] blocks Sarah screaming to the top of her
[1:22:02] voice daddy Becky's got my
[1:22:05] blocks daddy she took my pocketbook a
[1:22:09] while

[1:22:14] coming for prayer and the kids are in
[1:22:21] turmoil all right Joseph sitting in the
[1:22:24] floor beating on something as hard as he
[1:22:26] could the little
[1:22:29] boy he was beating and he was
[1:22:33] screaming can you picture it in your
[1:22:35] mind to the top of his voice now you
[1:22:38] talk about home sweet
[1:22:43] home I didn't think about it but brother
[1:22:45] R this will lead right into questions
[1:22:47] and answers for the young couples after
[1:22:49] after service the atmosphere within the
[1:22:53] home amen well I looked around I thought
[1:22:57] now there's just one thing to do we've
[1:23:00] got to change this situation and I love
[1:23:04] how he goes about changing this
[1:23:06] situation because he doesn't go about
[1:23:08] changing with a paddle and whipping
[1:23:09] everybody and sending them to their
[1:23:12] room it doesn't fix
[1:23:16] everything so many and all through the
[1:23:20] night now those people there through the
[1:23:23] day so many and all through the night
[1:23:25] does disturb the children but I want to
[1:23:28] be with them a little while so I thought
[1:23:31] Lord now you help me he says in my heart
[1:23:35] let me I'm just letting down to talk to
[1:23:37] you from my bottom of my heart tonight
[1:23:39] now of some things that you don't have
[1:23:41] to tell everybody so I said Lord you
[1:23:45] help me now to get upon me the holy
[1:23:47] spirit in such a way that will change
[1:23:49] this situation so notice what he's doing
[1:23:52] he says so praying to myself I put my
[1:23:55] arm around my little wife and I said oh
[1:23:59] sweetheart I really feel sorry for you
[1:24:03] what did he start off by doing started
[1:24:05] off by prayer he started off realizing
[1:24:09] that before he could fix the situation
[1:24:12] and the atmosphere in the house he had
[1:24:14] to make sure that his heart and his
[1:24:16] Spirit was in the right place with the
[1:24:18] holy spirit because we can't fix
[1:24:21] anything when we have a wrong attitude
[1:24:24] ourselves and that goes for all aspects
[1:24:27] of life it goes beyond just the
[1:24:30] household and our family and our
[1:24:31] children it goes to situations in work
[1:24:34] situations in school people you meet at
[1:24:37] the grocery store whatever it may
[1:24:42] be it starts off by fixing
[1:24:45] ourselves before we can help somebody
[1:24:48] else in the situation around us she said
[1:24:51] Billy I don't believe I can hold out any
[1:24:53] longer she said oh I'm just going to
[1:24:56] Pieces Just look at this house I said
[1:25:00] yes that's right honey that's exactly
[1:25:02] right and I put my hand around you know
[1:25:05] and I said I know it sweetheart I
[1:25:07] thought Lord you quieten
[1:25:10] her and I said no that's true but you
[1:25:13] know honey the other day when I was in
[1:25:15] Louisville I seen one of those pretty
[1:25:17] little he and he talks about what is
[1:25:19] that thing it's called a blouse he says
[1:25:21] I saw one of those pretty
[1:25:22] ones someplace where was it uh she said
[1:25:26] but Billy no time to talk about
[1:25:32] blouses she didn't realize what he was
[1:25:34] doing he was sensitizing her
[1:25:38] spirit we got no time to talk about
[1:25:40] blouses I kept my hand on her now honey
[1:25:43] I tell you you never seen such a pretty
[1:25:45] blouse I said look I tell you what Let's
[1:25:49] do let's get supper right quick and when
[1:25:52] we go I'll take you and show it to you
[1:25:54] I'll buy it for you oh she said that's
[1:25:57] nice of you Billy I couldn't look at a
[1:25:59] blouse tonight just look at me no doubt
[1:26:03] she hadn't a time to do her ha no doubt
[1:26:06] she was still in in in in with her apron
[1:26:08] on and and and she had so much to do
[1:26:11] because that's how women think guys we
[1:26:14] think let's go get something to eat
[1:26:15] let's just go girls think no we got to
[1:26:18] do the dishes we got to clean up the
[1:26:19] house we got to organize this and before
[1:26:21] you know it it's bad time we just think
[1:26:23] differently I think sometimes girls
[1:26:25] should just think like us it's a lot
[1:26:27] easier let's just
[1:26:30] go the time is now you better strike
[1:26:33] while irons hop before I change my
[1:26:43] mind so follow along with me here cuz
[1:26:46] this is a great lesson for us to learn
[1:26:48] and I know you all know the quote and I
[1:26:51] know you've all heard it preach before
[1:26:52] and I know you you've all read it and
[1:26:54] heard brother brandham say it but it's
[1:26:56] good for us to be remembered of these
[1:27:00] things let's get dinner right quick and
[1:27:02] I'll take it and I'll show and I'll even
[1:27:04] buy it for he say oh honey just look at
[1:27:06] me but look honey oh if you just see it
[1:27:09] I believe that you'd want to buy
[1:27:12] it Lord quieten her
[1:27:15] see he's putting his hand he's putting
[1:27:19] his hand on her I said I tell you what
[1:27:21] you put on me your apron let me help you
[1:27:24] get
[1:27:26] supper and so everybody thanks all the
[1:27:28] women are like praise
[1:27:33] God you see if you would just put on an
[1:27:36] apron once in a while and help with
[1:27:38] supper and do the dishes it would change
[1:27:40] the
[1:27:42] situations it
[1:27:44] helps but it started off by the prayer
[1:27:47] it started off by getting himself right
[1:27:50] and then he went from there and he's
[1:27:52] putting his hand on her shoulder and all
[1:27:55] the time he's taking control of that
[1:27:57] spirit that has her all riled up he's
[1:28:00] saying Lord quieten her and all the time
[1:28:03] he's talking in his heart he's saying
[1:28:05] quiet her little Spirit Lord and while
[1:28:08] her spirit is being quietened now he's
[1:28:11] talking to her about something that she
[1:28:12] enjoys and all of a sudden now we're
[1:28:14] going to see that the atmosphere is
[1:28:17] beginning to change it wasn't the apron
[1:28:20] that changed the atmosphere spere no
[1:28:23] doubt he would have gotten brownie
[1:28:24] points for it but it started long before
[1:28:27] that amen he said let me help you get
[1:28:31] supper so I put this apron on you know
[1:28:33] and begin to chop up some carrots and
[1:28:35] things you know and going on I I'll just
[1:28:38] interject this I was helping with
[1:28:40] breakfast yesterday morning and that big
[1:28:43] old big old pot of gravy and uh and
[1:28:46] Ashlin said okay stir that thing I said
[1:28:48] okay I'll stir it and I'm stirring it
[1:28:50] and stirring it and and Anthony roess
[1:28:53] comes over to me and he says Hey brother
[1:28:55] stevenh I said yeah what's up he goes
[1:28:58] you don't cook a lot do
[1:28:59] you come on no why he goes I can tell by
[1:29:03] how you're stirring that
[1:29:07] [Laughter]
[1:29:13] gravy oh bless his
[1:29:16] heart the carrots and things you know
[1:29:18] going on once in a while she begin to
[1:29:20] quit crying I thought thank you Lord and
[1:29:24] I said oh honey Isn't the Lord wonderful
[1:29:27] he's just so good kept talking to her
[1:29:31] changing that atmosphere laying my hand
[1:29:35] on her as soon as I got her quiet after
[1:29:38] a while she was all
[1:29:40] smiles she said well Billy you think the
[1:29:43] stores would be
[1:29:45] open I'm pretty sure they will be I
[1:29:48] think they will be I thought thank you
[1:29:50] Lord it's working
[1:29:52] are we all taking notes here and this
[1:29:55] isn't just for the man whenever whenever
[1:29:59] our kids or our wives or whoever it may
[1:30:02] be when we see that the atmosphere is
[1:30:04] not right around us you have to do your
[1:30:07] part to get the guy softened up if
[1:30:10] you're at work and you see that
[1:30:12] someone's having a hard day and they
[1:30:13] reply with a with a sharp comment with
[1:30:16] you it's not the right time to reply to
[1:30:18] them with a sharp
[1:30:20] comment cuz there's something wrong
[1:30:23] there's something wrong with their
[1:30:24] atmosphere tried putting your hand on
[1:30:26] their shoulder and saying father before
[1:30:30] I say something they quiet in this guy's
[1:30:32] spirit and before you know before you
[1:30:34] know it and you talk to him and you say
[1:30:37] what's going
[1:30:38] on chances are they'll say man I had a
[1:30:41] bad day I had a rough night my kids this
[1:30:45] that somebody sick whatever it might be
[1:30:48] and then you realize now your spirit is
[1:30:50] soft and their spirit is soft and it
[1:30:53] takes away all the
[1:30:55] animosity so it's not just for the home
[1:30:58] life between Mom and Dad this takes care
[1:31:01] of our whole lives of everybody that we
[1:31:04] come in contact with
[1:31:07] amen I thought thank you Lord it's
[1:31:10] working so he just kept on and the first
[1:31:13] thing you know Sarah and Becky divided
[1:31:15] up their blocks in other words they
[1:31:17] started sharing and Joseph got him a
[1:31:20] little rattler and there was more peace
[1:31:23] in the home see now the only thing you
[1:31:26] have to change the situation if that can
[1:31:29] be done in the home it can be done in a
[1:31:32] church and the church
[1:31:36] said it can be done in a nation it could
[1:31:40] be done in the whole world it's the
[1:31:42] atmosphere that counts the natural way
[1:31:46] to hatch an egg is put it under the hand
[1:31:47] because she keeps it warm but put it
[1:31:49] under the same kind of a heat and it'll
[1:31:51] hatch anyhow it's the atmosphere that
[1:31:54] counts that's right so it's the
[1:31:55] atmosphere and you make up that
[1:31:57] atmosphere with what you are inside of
[1:32:03] you now what are these what are these
[1:32:06] lessons that we can learn from this it's
[1:32:09] not to act harshly in situations and if
[1:32:13] we feel that we're going to ask God God
[1:32:16] softened my heart before I try to fix
[1:32:20] this situation and then let God do it
[1:32:23] because too much of the time we enter it
[1:32:26] with the wrong atmosphere and everything
[1:32:28] blows
[1:32:30] up which ain't good for
[1:32:33] nobody ain't good for our families it
[1:32:36] ain't good for our church and ain't good
[1:32:38] for our
[1:32:41] nation
[1:32:45] amen now we can see that the atmosphere
[1:32:49] in the world isang changing extremely
[1:32:55] rapidly we found we found in our opening
[1:32:58] scripture that there be Wars and there's
[1:33:01] rumors of wars we see that not only is
[1:33:04] there rumors of wars but there's more
[1:33:07] Wars and then there's rumors of more
[1:33:09] Wars and then there's more Wars it seems
[1:33:11] like since since I can remember there's
[1:33:14] more Wars Happening Now amongst all over
[1:33:19] the world than there has ever been
[1:33:23] and you can feel it in the
[1:33:25] atmosphere you can sense the atmosphere
[1:33:29] of peace is starting to change the
[1:33:32] atmosphere of safety within a nation is
[1:33:36] starting to change we think well that's
[1:33:40] just in Israel well I beg to
[1:33:43] differ you see these guys out here
[1:33:45] protesting and
[1:33:46] stuff you think they're they they they
[1:33:49] love American society and and you got to
[1:33:52] be kidding
[1:33:55] me it's changing times are changing and
[1:33:59] the atmospheres are changing men's
[1:34:02] hearts are failing for fear we see that
[1:34:06] people on I'm reading scripture here we
[1:34:08] see that people are he they're
[1:34:11] highminded they're lovers of Pleasures
[1:34:14] more than lovers of God we see that
[1:34:17] there there's no morals within people's
[1:34:20] lives anymore
[1:34:23] we see that the governments are corrupt
[1:34:25] the countries around the world
[1:34:27] everything is just a ball of absolute
[1:34:30] corruption and it's all because of the
[1:34:32] wrong atmosphere that is surrounding us
[1:34:36] as
[1:34:37] people we see that there's earthquakes
[1:34:40] in diverse places we see that there's
[1:34:43] famines there's floods and we could go
[1:34:45] on and on with the list of of of of
[1:34:49] signs of the end times that we are now
[1:34:51] living
[1:34:54] in brother brandham said that it was 3
[1:34:57] Minutes to Midnight I looked up the
[1:34:59] Doomsday Clock the other day and it said
[1:35:02] it's 90 Seconds To Midnight the whole
[1:35:06] world is declaring that there's
[1:35:08] something happening amongst us that this
[1:35:12] world is going to
[1:35:14] end the whole world is starting to
[1:35:17] notice the signs of the times they're
[1:35:20] starting to re recognize the day that
[1:35:23] they are living in but the problem is
[1:35:26] they are failing to recognize the
[1:35:28] message that they are living in brother
[1:35:32] Brenham said recognizing your day and
[1:35:36] it in other words recognizing your day
[1:35:40] and the anointed word that's supposed to
[1:35:43] be fulfilled for this day a lot of times
[1:35:46] I've been thinking about it a lot
[1:35:48] whenever we talk about when we say the
[1:35:50] message we we put it in a category of a
[1:35:53] man and we say the message and the
[1:35:56] message well and we and we label brother
[1:35:58] brandom with the message but really what
[1:36:00] the message is is the Vindicated word it
[1:36:04] is Anointed by God to be fulfilled for
[1:36:07] this day not for another day not for
[1:36:10] another age going by but the day in
[1:36:13] which we are living in amen it is God's
[1:36:17] word it is God's word that is being f
[1:36:23] fulfilled but we say well we're a
[1:36:25] message believer when I'm a I'm an
[1:36:27] anointed word believer I would kind of
[1:36:31] rather say that at this point sometimes
[1:36:33] because that's really what it is it has
[1:36:36] nothing to do with a
[1:36:38] man though man was the was is something
[1:36:42] that God
[1:36:44] uses but yet it's so hard for people not
[1:36:47] to get our eyes upon the
[1:36:50] man
[1:36:54] the world is in a Sodom
[1:36:56] condition man leaving the natural use of
[1:36:59] the woman burning in their lust one for
[1:37:02] another Bible says as it was in the days
[1:37:04] of Noah so shall it be the Bible says as
[1:37:08] it was in the days of lot so shall it
[1:37:14] be people are realizing you could go on
[1:37:17] to YouTube people get on there and
[1:37:19] they'll say prophecy for fulfilled
[1:37:22] Israel is in our homeland prophecy
[1:37:24] fulfilled Israel's at War prophecy
[1:37:26] fulfilled and they're seeing all these
[1:37:28] prophecies fulfilled they're seeing the
[1:37:31] signs of the end times but understand
[1:37:34] seeing the signs Hallelujah seeing the
[1:37:37] sign of the end time will not change you
[1:37:39] as a
[1:37:40] Believer because the signs of the end
[1:37:43] times brings a fear upon the people but
[1:37:46] when the fear leaves guess what happens
[1:37:49] that sincerity that was once there
[1:37:51] causing people to get in line with God
[1:37:53] leaves they go back to what they were
[1:37:55] before why because it's an emotional
[1:37:58] thing it's fear and it's not by faith
[1:38:01] outside of the anointed word of the hour
[1:38:03] there's nothing that can hold us there's
[1:38:06] nothing that can keep us you can see the
[1:38:09] signs you can know about Israel you can
[1:38:11] know about these different things but
[1:38:13] when you see the word Vindicated that's
[1:38:16] what holds us that's what protects us
[1:38:19] and that's what gives us overcoming
[1:38:20] power
[1:38:23] it's not just knowing about what's going
[1:38:25] on around us cuz that's a fearful
[1:38:28] thing but when the fear leaves what
[1:38:31] happens everybody goes right back to
[1:38:33] what they were
[1:38:36] before just look at the war in
[1:38:39] Russia you guys all remember when Russia
[1:38:43] first invaded
[1:38:44] Ukraine and the whole world was thinking
[1:38:46] my goodness I didn't think they were
[1:38:47] going to do it and everybody in the
[1:38:49] message is saying watch Russia King of
[1:38:52] the North watch Russia oh my there was
[1:38:55] people started coming back to church
[1:38:57] because they were fearful of the signs
[1:39:00] of the times but now that it's went on
[1:39:04] 3 90 days whatever it is I don't know
[1:39:07] something like that who even talks about
[1:39:09] the war in Russia
[1:39:11] now I don't see it on my Apple
[1:39:14] news I don't really see it coming up in
[1:39:17] my news suggestions why because now
[1:39:20] there's something else going on but yet
[1:39:23] so the people that perhaps went back to
[1:39:26] church and serving God because of fear
[1:39:29] of King of the North now that that's
[1:39:31] kind of uh not passed but the fear has
[1:39:35] subsided I want to ask you how was their
[1:39:38] walk with God
[1:39:40] now chances are it's back to the same
[1:39:43] old way that it used to be why because
[1:39:47] there's no fear that's driving
[1:39:49] them the bride of Christ is not drove by
[1:39:51] fear she's drove by love amen we love
[1:39:55] him because he first loved us and that's
[1:39:59] what keeps us in line is our love for
[1:40:05] him yes
[1:40:10] Lord hallelujah we've seen I've
[1:40:13] mentioned all these different signs
[1:40:16] that's all around
[1:40:18] us but yet and I think the timing is
[1:40:22] almost like impeccable of the little
[1:40:25] series that brother Ron is going on the
[1:40:27] revealing of the son of
[1:40:29] man and though for some it might seem
[1:40:32] like we know these things and we've
[1:40:34] heard these things for years and and and
[1:40:38] and and on and on and and and and yes
[1:40:40] praise the Lord but I think the timing
[1:40:43] is impeccable because it's bringing us
[1:40:45] back into a
[1:40:47] remembrance that the signs of the day is
[1:40:50] not what is getting the bride of Christ
[1:40:53] ready it is the revealing of the son of
[1:40:56] man an open word book is what is getting
[1:41:00] us ready and so it's putting our eyes
[1:41:03] and our faith back into remembrance of
[1:41:06] this stuff out here is not changing me
[1:41:09] it's the word that changes me and so if
[1:41:13] the word changes me I want to get into
[1:41:16] the word I want to partake of the word
[1:41:19] because the word became flesh that the
[1:41:23] flesh man might become
[1:41:30] word we can look at many of you remember
[1:41:34] Camala Harris when she was first voted
[1:41:36] in as vice president and here she was
[1:41:40] dressed and robed in
[1:41:42] purple and everybody wow it's a
[1:41:45] fulfillment of scripture and she's
[1:41:47] dressed in purple and here she is she's
[1:41:49] going to be in a uh uh the vice
[1:41:52] president and if something happens to
[1:41:53] the vice pres to the president she's in
[1:41:55] and all this stuff and it was a big deal
[1:41:59] amongst message
[1:42:00] Believers but now
[1:42:03] what have any of us mentioned our vice
[1:42:07] president Kamala Harris's name in the
[1:42:09] last week
[1:42:12] no because she's hiding and not doing
[1:42:19] anything
[1:42:22] I shouldn't have said that I'm
[1:42:27] sorry truth is truth
[1:42:31] huh we were all caught up with it but
[1:42:35] now the time has went on guess what it's
[1:42:37] not a big deal anymore and so now those
[1:42:40] who were being pressed by fear of this
[1:42:43] end time prophecy of a woman in charge
[1:42:47] and now that it's not coming to pass as
[1:42:49] we first thought thought it would of her
[1:42:51] being president and running the show
[1:42:53] guess what we all get back in our
[1:42:56] complacency oh yeah well I guess that's
[1:42:58] another one it wasn't the right time
[1:43:00] well yeah praise the Lord praise the
[1:43:03] Lord I'll just go back and and I'll stop
[1:43:05] shaving off the things of the world
[1:43:07] because the time is not right
[1:43:10] yet understand brother Brenham said and
[1:43:12] I'll give you the quote thus saith the
[1:43:15] Lord you're receiving your last
[1:43:18] sign we received our last sign in the
[1:43:22] 1960s it doesn't matter what else
[1:43:24] happens here now notice the sign is sent
[1:43:26] for the bride the sign is not sent for
[1:43:30] denominational world worldism it's not
[1:43:33] sent for those people out there but it's
[1:43:35] sent for the bride to prepare her to get
[1:43:39] ready
[1:43:44] amen how many of you have been watching
[1:43:46] the war in Israel right
[1:43:49] now it's a fearful thing things are
[1:43:53] escalating extremely
[1:43:56] quickly what's so interesting to me is
[1:43:59] is not necessarily the the war in Israel
[1:44:04] and though it's bad and people are
[1:44:05] losing their lives and and it should
[1:44:08] never have happened the scary thing for
[1:44:10] me is the protests that are going on
[1:44:12] around the
[1:44:14] world kill the Jews gas the Jews they're
[1:44:18] closing down cities and London and all
[1:44:20] all these different places here even in
[1:44:22] our in in ASU brother Zach huh he told
[1:44:27] me the other day he he's standing there
[1:44:28] with this Israeli flag and there's all
[1:44:30] these other uh Palestinian people and
[1:44:34] they're saying free Palestine kill the
[1:44:38] Jews cast them out kill them they're the
[1:44:43] occupiers but yet they can protest and
[1:44:46] get away with it I want to ask you what
[1:44:48] kind of spirit is that that's driving in
[1:44:50] these
[1:44:51] people to where they can get behind a
[1:44:54] terrorist
[1:44:56] organization that killed innocent people
[1:45:00] if you want to kill the Jews hey go for
[1:45:02] their army base innocent people didn't
[1:45:05] do anything but yet now that tree free
[1:45:09] that
[1:45:10] pre-tribulation spirit is still alive
[1:45:14] today because Spirits never die and
[1:45:17] guess what they're getting away with it
[1:45:19] because the old the whole world is
[1:45:22] agreeing with Palestine there's just a
[1:45:24] Chosen Few that are staying strong with
[1:45:29] Israel but you already see it within our
[1:45:32] own country people starting to turn
[1:45:34] against
[1:45:36] Israel what happens when we turn against
[1:45:39] Israel as a
[1:45:40] country we're doomed amen it can happen
[1:45:45] quicker than what we
[1:45:49] think so then you see
[1:45:51] Iran how much money has the US sent to
[1:45:55] Iran billions of
[1:45:57] dollars yeah here's money go buy Rockets
[1:46:02] go buy all this stuff what do you
[1:46:03] think's going to
[1:46:06] happen so now they give it to the
[1:46:08] terrorists Hamas Hezbollah all these
[1:46:11] different things who's real tight with
[1:46:14] Iran
[1:46:17] Russia watch Russia King of the North
[1:46:21] Ezekiel
[1:46:23] 38 things are
[1:46:27] transpiring says he'll come in from the
[1:46:29] north where's Iran where's the Iranian
[1:46:33] border with Israel it's on the northern
[1:46:38] border what time are we living
[1:46:41] in if the word isn't changing you
[1:46:44] hopefully this will we're right there
[1:46:48] further brandom said there's only one
[1:46:49] thing that's holding this whole thing up
[1:46:52] and that's the Bride of Jesus
[1:46:55] Christ it's just interesting and I'm
[1:46:57] just talking from my heart about that
[1:46:59] whole situation it's just it's really
[1:47:02] really interesting how the chest pieces
[1:47:05] are all starting to
[1:47:08] move it's all start everybody's starting
[1:47:10] to get into their place and let me just
[1:47:12] ask the question what's the pope doing
[1:47:15] right
[1:47:16] now I don't know I haven't seen anything
[1:47:21] he's the one we need to be watching
[1:47:24] for is he going to come in with to try
[1:47:28] and cause peace and have a union with
[1:47:30] Israel and are we going to I don't know
[1:47:33] but he's too quiet for his own
[1:47:36] good he's hiding
[1:47:40] something he
[1:47:42] is they're getting ready to move a bunch
[1:47:44] of Pawns I tell you what the queen she's
[1:47:47] about ready to go
[1:47:49] up yes sir thank you
[1:47:53] Lord all these things are the signs of
[1:47:56] the times but we the bride we have
[1:47:59] received our last sign and it's the
[1:48:02] voice behind the sign that is quickening
[1:48:04] our hearts to prepare us for his soon
[1:48:06] coming 1965 this day the scriptures
[1:48:08] fulfilled and we have not one other type
[1:48:12] I have I have to type scriptures because
[1:48:14] I don't have an education enough to
[1:48:15] bring the words and things I make it
[1:48:17] type but if I see the shadow if I never
[1:48:19] see my hand and see the shadow I know I
[1:48:21] had five fingers and that's the way you
[1:48:22] have to watch the scripture in the Old
[1:48:24] Testament what does it do it foreshadow
[1:48:26] is this and Jesus said that Sodom was
[1:48:28] the foreshadow of the end time now and
[1:48:31] the Very scriptures that was promised to
[1:48:33] Sodom the very scriptures that was
[1:48:35] taking place at Sodom that Jesus said
[1:48:37] would repeat itself again in this day
[1:48:40] it's made known right before us today he
[1:48:43] says God bless you don't miss it
[1:48:46] whatever you do don't miss it and if I
[1:48:49] don't see you here here next year when
[1:48:51] they climb the golden stairs I hope to
[1:48:52] meet you up there God bless you what was
[1:48:56] happening at this time of the time of
[1:48:59] Sodom and Gomorrah we can just look at
[1:49:01] their their their their their their
[1:49:04] natural country and we realize that they
[1:49:06] were in a state of sin they were in a
[1:49:09] state of where they got uh remember the
[1:49:11] kings that rose up against them and and
[1:49:14] took all their women and took lot and
[1:49:15] everything like that they were at a time
[1:49:17] of War there was a time where sin was in
[1:49:19] abundance where the sodomites kind of
[1:49:21] like ruled the ruled the place there was
[1:49:25] no rules whatever could be whatever they
[1:49:28] thought could be done it was done and we
[1:49:31] look at this sign but forget to realize
[1:49:35] that there was something else that was
[1:49:36] going on at that time Abraham was
[1:49:40] meeting with
[1:49:43] Elohim let Sodom be Sodom we are not
[1:49:47] part of Sodom we're not part of louia
[1:49:50] anymore but we're in the bride age yes
[1:49:53] sir so what was happening with the bride
[1:49:55] up there I love this notice Abraham and
[1:49:59] Sarah did not go looking for God but God
[1:50:03] came to
[1:50:04] them Hallelujah Abraham wasn't out there
[1:50:07] searching and saying oh God I want to
[1:50:09] talk to you no no no no no he came to
[1:50:12] Abraham he came to their tent he came to
[1:50:15] their dwelling place because he wants to
[1:50:18] have intimate Fellowship
[1:50:20] praise the Lord he said oh my Lord
[1:50:23] Elohim he recognized him the voice of
[1:50:27] God guess what the bride recognizes
[1:50:30] it I'll stay a little while let me fetch
[1:50:34] the the this CF he's tender he's going
[1:50:36] to taste good let me let me make some
[1:50:38] butter let me let me do the let me serve
[1:50:40] you Lord let me serve you it's not what
[1:50:44] God can do for us but it's what we can
[1:50:46] do for God cuz he's already done
[1:50:49] everything for us amen prise the Lord it
[1:50:52] was their Dwelling Place he came to them
[1:50:56] when they weren't looking for him why
[1:50:59] because it was
[1:51:01] time all of us have a time that we meet
[1:51:06] with God and I pray that we just don't
[1:51:09] go back to one time in our lives but we
[1:51:11] say father meet me
[1:51:13] again and again and again and again
[1:51:18] because once isn't good enough
[1:51:23] so he had fellowship with Abraham he had
[1:51:27] fellowship with Sarah and they had
[1:51:29] communion one with another what was he
[1:51:33] doing he was breaking the word to them
[1:51:35] any Wonder this third pole Ministry has
[1:51:39] to do with a
[1:51:40] tent it's a dwelling
[1:51:43] place it's no longer in the outer courts
[1:51:47] it's not even on the inner courts but as
[1:51:49] in the whole holiest of holies and
[1:51:52] that's where he meets the believer in
[1:51:54] that little room where the room in your
[1:52:00] heart what does he do when he meets Us
[1:52:02] in there he has communion he breaks the
[1:52:06] word we eat with him we sck with him and
[1:52:10] he reveals to us this open Word
[1:52:18] Book why was he doing that because it
[1:52:20] was time for the promise to be
[1:52:23] fulfilled it was time for them to
[1:52:25] receive their body change because in the
[1:52:28] state that they were in guess what they
[1:52:31] could never bring forth the promised son
[1:52:34] Isaac would never have come forth unless
[1:52:37] they were
[1:52:38] changed so it is with us unless we start
[1:52:42] shaving off unless we get into that
[1:52:44] perfect faith of perfect rapturing Faith
[1:52:48] he's not going to come so he's waiting
[1:52:50] for us to get in our position to shave
[1:52:53] the things off of the world that he
[1:52:55] might come and receive them on receive
[1:52:56] us onto
[1:53:00] himself so what did he
[1:53:03] do he said I'm going to visit with
[1:53:07] youall and here was Sarah in the
[1:53:11] tent me an old woman ah I don't think
[1:53:17] so you know when I thought about it
[1:53:20] today you know I don't believe Sarah was
[1:53:22] being
[1:53:24] arrogant because the bride of Christ is
[1:53:26] not
[1:53:28] arrogant I just believe she was being
[1:53:30] truthful and said oh me I'm an old woman
[1:53:34] how can I have pleasure with my Lord how
[1:53:37] is this even possible so then he calls
[1:53:40] her out and he discerns the thoughts
[1:53:43] that was within our heart brother
[1:53:45] brandham said you're receiving your last
[1:53:47] sign understand as it was was in that
[1:53:51] day before Sodom was burned up with
[1:53:54] fire the son of man was
[1:53:58] revealing the
[1:54:00] word Discerning the hearts of the
[1:54:03] people as that was the last sign before
[1:54:06] Sodom was burned up now brother brandham
[1:54:09] is tying it together and he's saying
[1:54:12] this is your last
[1:54:14] sign not Israel being at War that's
[1:54:18] where the church
[1:54:20] not sodomites and all these different
[1:54:22] things and and and and and and and
[1:54:24] countries corrupt and and Satan having
[1:54:27] his way everywhere he goes no no no no
[1:54:29] no that's for the church that's not for
[1:54:32] the bride so take your eyes take your
[1:54:35] eyes off what is sent to the church and
[1:54:39] keep your eyes on what is sent to the
[1:54:41] bride because he said I know longer call
[1:54:44] you uh servant I call you friend he said
[1:54:47] I no longer call you church I'm called
[1:54:49] calling you bride so when he's speaking
[1:54:52] to the bride we should be listening stop
[1:54:55] paying attention to what is sent to get
[1:54:57] to the attention of the
[1:55:01] church and put your attention and set
[1:55:04] yourself on the wings of a dove and Fly
[1:55:07] Above All this
[1:55:11] nonsense it'll free you up it'll make
[1:55:14] you happier it'll make your faith into a
[1:55:17] perfect Faith ready for a rest Rapture
[1:55:20] amen help us Lord notice this spiritual
[1:55:24] Amia 1964 I want to ask you something
[1:55:27] what if he does come tonight if the
[1:55:29] musicians would come oh say he isn't
[1:55:32] coming I don't know whether he is or not
[1:55:34] he said this is the last sign remember
[1:55:38] thus sayeth the Lord whenever he says
[1:55:40] thus sayeth the Lord that's God Almighty
[1:55:47] speaking you know what's interesting
[1:55:50] about the testimony of B Billy Paul
[1:55:53] whenever he shares it not one time does
[1:55:55] he ever say thus sayith the
[1:55:59] lord it's on YouTube you can listen to
[1:56:02] his testimony when he talks about
[1:56:04] it interesting isn't
[1:56:07] it you are seeing your last sign he said
[1:56:10] that scriptural you've seen your last
[1:56:12] sign Pentecost don't get mixed up now
[1:56:14] with what he promised Israel after the
[1:56:17] Rapture that ain't you
[1:56:20] you were done then see now is your day
[1:56:24] now is your sign notice this is your day
[1:56:27] and this is your sign not the sign to
[1:56:30] the world but right here
[1:56:34] amen now is your time don't reject it
[1:56:37] don't do it you'd better come you
[1:56:39] believe me to be God's servant
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:46] remember say brother Stephen
[1:56:51] we know these
[1:56:53] things yeah it's good for your
[1:56:57] remembrance how easy it is for
[1:57:00] us as bride
[1:57:03] material to get caught up with the stuff
[1:57:07] that is sent to the church that's right
[1:57:09] with the stuff that is sent to
[1:57:13] loua and we
[1:57:15] forget that this is our last sign
[1:57:19] there's no other sign that's given to
[1:57:20] the
[1:57:22] bride we've had it for years upon years
[1:57:26] so now the question is
[1:57:28] this what are we as individuals doing
[1:57:31] with
[1:57:33] it because we can preach about it and
[1:57:36] you can understand it and you can say
[1:57:39] yep I agree that that is 100% the truth
[1:57:44] but if you don't do anything about
[1:57:46] it if you don't take it into your heart
[1:57:49] and say Lord this is so true I've been
[1:57:53] caught up with the church that I have
[1:57:55] forgotten that as the bride we have our
[1:57:59] last sign and now I'm clothing myself
[1:58:03] I'm shaving myself of the things of the
[1:58:06] world and now I'm clothing myself in
[1:58:09] your word of
[1:58:11] righteousness because when he
[1:58:14] comes he's going to take one thing with
[1:58:17] him and that's his word
[1:58:21] amen the word is coming for the
[1:58:24] word the word is not coming for you as a
[1:58:28] flesh person cuz your flesh is going to
[1:58:30] be changed in a moment in the twinkling
[1:58:32] of an eye but when the word comes he
[1:58:34] onlyi recognizes one thing and that's
[1:58:37] the word and so now it's up to us as
[1:58:41] Believers to take the word clothe
[1:58:44] yourself with it eat it and become the
[1:58:46] word cuz when we become the word guess
[1:58:49] what happens when he comes will he find
[1:58:51] Faith absolutely how is he going to find
[1:58:54] Faith cuz I am the word I am the
[1:58:56] manifestation of this open book and so
[1:58:59] when he comes he's only going to see
[1:59:03] me so be
[1:59:05] encouraged don't be downtrodden don't be
[1:59:08] fearful of the things that's coming upon
[1:59:10] the Earth cuz it's only going to get
[1:59:12] worse put your hope and trust in God
[1:59:15] alone and in the word God bless you give
[1:59:18] the Lord a hand clap and this
[1:59:23] morning
[1:59:26] Hallelujah God bless
[1:59:33] you s my stand together to
[1:59:40] receive I
