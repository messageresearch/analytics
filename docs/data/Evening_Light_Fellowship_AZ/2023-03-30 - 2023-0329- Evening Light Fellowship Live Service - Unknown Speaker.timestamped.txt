[9:23] the difference was the blood
[9:25] amen it's just we have a lot of written
[9:28] requests here and I know there's
[9:29] requests that were not pinned I'm going
[9:32] to read these and then we'll sing that
[9:33] one more time as brother Ron comes he's
[9:34] going to give us an update and take the
[9:36] knees before the Lord sister Nancy Tempe
[9:38] has turned in several requests here
[9:40] our first one is for Healing Touch for
[9:42] my uncle who's back in the hospital
[9:45] with congestive heart failure and looks
[9:48] like fluid on his lungs
[9:51] her second is a friendly friend requests
[9:53] prayer for her son and his wife for a
[9:56] situation to get solved with their new
[9:58] neighbor
[9:59] and thirdly she has an unspoken request
[10:01] so we just want to remember that just
[10:03] and also for you know this is
[10:09] true Christian
[10:11] because sister Nancy has great needs in
[10:12] her life
[10:14] let's not open this paper
[10:15] [Music]
[10:18] God help us all
[10:20] sister Fiona Walters is having surgery
[10:22] Friday
[10:23] and we're praying the Lord gives the
[10:25] surgeon's hand
[10:27] and a quick recovery Amen to that this
[10:30] is from Brother Tom Yazzie right before
[10:31] service please remember my mom Effie in
[10:34] prayer I just got a text from her saying
[10:37] she might be flown out to Cottonwood
[10:39] hospital tonight or tomorrow so God
[10:42] knows that need we place it in his hand
[10:44] please remember sister Jennifer it looks
[10:47] like Dubose in Florida I believe she's a
[10:50] streamer and she needs a Special Touch
[10:52] for her and her husband
[10:54] uh this is from Sister Tara Traub please
[10:57] pay for my grandpa Douglas he got stung
[11:00] by a stingray three weeks ago and it
[11:02] hasn't healed tomorrow he begins one of
[11:05] multiple surgeries on his foot I just
[11:08] know the Lord is mindful of that sister
[11:11] Jennifer and brother Matt Clayville had
[11:13] turned in a it's a praise report and
[11:15] attached to a request here this morning
[11:18] our work was informed that they were
[11:20] shutting down the Scottsdale facility
[11:22] where we worked with 841 people and they
[11:24] all lost their jobs
[11:26] we were informed because we work from
[11:28] home we get to keep our job we thank and
[11:31] praise the Lord for his meeting our
[11:33] needs and watching over us please pray
[11:36] God is with those that did lose their
[11:39] jobs God is our Jehovah Jireh and we
[11:41] rest in that
[11:43] on the way here tonight they had the
[11:45] road shut down and just seen a
[11:47] motorcycle on the road and just you know
[11:49] just those kind of things you just Lord
[11:51] just have mercy so just remember this
[11:53] gentleman that was in this motorcycle
[11:55] accident the Lord just have mercy on him
[11:57] and then also I just wrote some requests
[11:59] on our hearts here brother Johan looks
[12:02] like he's home but still recovering so
[12:03] just Lord be with him and brother Ron
[12:06] will give a update on brother Neil Mater
[12:08] continue to remember Sister Rebecca page
[12:10] uh little Josiah McGrady Theo was able
[12:13] to have a um his treatment this week his
[12:16] ANC numbers were really good 6 000 is
[12:18] better than this ever been so we're very
[12:20] thankful for that knowing the Lord is
[12:23] doing the work
[12:24] and then I know some of y'all familiar
[12:27] with brother Terry tidwell's music
[12:29] Ministry his wife Vicki a lot of people
[12:31] don't know this she's been battling a
[12:33] form of cancer for 10 years and they did
[12:36] everything they can do with their
[12:38] platelets and they can't get the numbers
[12:39] back up because at some point your body
[12:41] just rejects them and they told her
[12:43] there's nothing else we can do and
[12:45] that's okay because when the doctors say
[12:47] we're done I believe Jesus Takes Over I
[12:50] rest in that I believe it and brother
[12:52] Johnny Reynolds had his open heart
[12:54] surgery and uh brother Ron could
[12:56] probably give a little update on that as
[12:57] well but just praying the Lord be with
[12:59] him and continue to just touch him and
[13:02] lift him up it's a lot of needs
[13:06] but you know what like brother Patterson
[13:08] says all the time
[13:10] the Lord is faithful to Deliver Us from
[13:13] all of them let's just sing that again
[13:14] as brother Ron comes

[15:23] [Music]
[15:27] God bless you all this evening
[15:30] I greet you in the lovely name of Jesus
[15:32] Christ couple things that I want to make
[15:35] an announcement on before I go into the
[15:38] prayer request what a tremendous time of
[15:41] the moving of the spirit we had on
[15:43] Sunday
[15:45] God moved in a sovereign way
[15:48] you saw it from the beginning of the
[15:49] service all the way to the end there and
[15:52] I want to say I was supposed to have a
[15:54] board meeting
[15:56] right after the service and my nominees
[15:59] and different ones and and their wives
[16:03] and I went and I told uh brother Chris I
[16:06] said brother Chris canceled the meeting
[16:09] of the board he heard cancel the meeting
[16:15] did some of you wonder why he came up
[16:17] here and kind of kind of shut it down
[16:20] oh my so I called him up I said brother
[16:23] Chris did did you did you unders he said
[16:27] all I heard was cancel the meeting
[16:29] he he you know I said oh my I said I am
[16:32] so sorry brother Chris I take that
[16:35] responsibility
[16:36] but let me tell you as a pastor when we
[16:39] have a moving in the spirit
[16:40] we want to do nothing to squelch it
[16:43] people come up here and pray and we'll
[16:45] have people playing and singing and I
[16:47] want some of our you know whether it's
[16:49] Justin uh dubsky and he's playing and
[16:53] singing I want them to get the
[16:55] experience of feeling that Holy Spirit
[16:58] and holding that that presence there I
[17:01] I'm sorry Saints
[17:03] uh he misunderstood me and he thought I
[17:06] canceled the meeting because I have to
[17:08] have another meeting and and it was my
[17:10] fault
[17:11] and I'm sorry
[17:13] and so but God knows hey huh we all
[17:16] learn he said oh brother Ron he said
[17:18] I'll go up there I said you ain't taking
[17:20] the fall for that one I said that that's
[17:22] on me and I I'm sorry and I truly
[17:24] apologize because I'll tell you what I
[17:27] was so moved
[17:29] that at the end of the service I was
[17:31] absolutely exhausted
[17:34] and I think I in trying to talk to him
[17:37] as
[17:38] I maybe didn't make it clear or whatever
[17:41] and there's people coming in and out and
[17:43] everything but my what a presence we had
[17:46] and I love that and that's what we live
[17:49] for we want to do nothing to quench the
[17:52] spirit of God Amen so I just wanted to
[17:54] make that announcement to you
[17:57] um and also because there was a moving
[18:01] and sometimes you will have the littler
[18:03] kids come up uh and maybe it wasn't a
[18:07] real genuine something on there because
[18:10] I saw him up here and as I'm looking at
[18:12] them there's some that oh genuine you
[18:15] see it oh my spirit of God's movement
[18:17] I'm going to leave it up to the parents
[18:21] you make a judgment on whether or not
[18:23] that little one that came up here
[18:25] is ready and because the Bible says
[18:28] repent and be baptized
[18:30] okay it's just not following the crowd
[18:33] it's doing what and yet if the parents
[18:37] say no it was genuine then what doth
[18:40] hinder because about even if you baptize
[18:43] them early
[18:44] it don't hurt them
[18:46] but if we deny them
[18:49] and as a genuine deal you you could hurt
[18:52] their little spirit and then they say
[18:54] well why wouldn't they let me do it see
[18:56] okay so that's back on appearance Sunday
[18:59] morning after the service we're going to
[19:01] have a baptismal and I got people coming
[19:03] from out of state too that we're
[19:05] streaming that their kids were so moved
[19:07] they said we're we're coming down just
[19:09] for the baptism
[19:11] amen praise the Lord
[19:16] so up update on brother Neil
[19:20] um we did go ahead and I had sister
[19:22] Linda send out kind of a a message to
[19:25] everyone he is in intensive care unit
[19:29] that means that really there should only
[19:31] be no more than two if sister Karen's in
[19:33] there she can have two more uh besides
[19:37] her that could go ahead and and visit
[19:40] but again when you go in there very
[19:42] quick
[19:43] hello
[19:45] uh you know and and just tell them
[19:48] you're praying for him and you love him
[19:49] type thing and um uh so you got that
[19:53] that no brother Neil is not out of
[19:57] critical situation right now
[20:00] I'm asking God to continue they call him
[20:03] a miracle man and every day he is he's
[20:06] we see some things will raise up it
[20:09] seems like a roller coaster we'll we'll
[20:11] get uh really good news and then it
[20:13] seems like a couple steps back but
[20:15] that's okay hey our God can do when the
[20:19] doctors say we're done
[20:21] we have a higher court of appeal I thank
[20:24] God brother Branham had so many people
[20:26] come through Doctors Don't Give You Up
[20:28] he said but God has heard your prayer
[20:31] tonight huh nothing will stand in your
[20:33] way not even cancer
[20:35] so uh be praying for brother Neil he uh
[20:39] he got a port
[20:41] an ivy port instead of a temporary
[20:43] they've had these Temporaries they went
[20:45] left and right they put a port in the
[20:48] shoulder here
[20:49] so that they don't have to do that and
[20:52] uh you know it just come out or whatever
[20:55] and
[20:56] um but is there anything else Sister
[20:58] Sarah that I need to make the people
[21:02] but uh anyway
[21:04] uh if you do go see him
[21:07] you make sure that you remember it's ICU
[21:11] Intensive Care Unit and that you call
[21:14] Sister Karen if he's in a procedure if
[21:18] they're doing something where you
[21:21] shouldn't be there they'll tell you to
[21:23] wait and then you can go to the waiting
[21:24] room and then they'll let you know okay
[21:27] but let's let's lift him up let's keep
[21:30] our prayers up right and all of these
[21:32] other prayer requests we're going to ask
[21:35] God to come on the scene and that same
[21:37] God even as uh uh brother Dave Pollock
[21:41] said brother Ron I believe God is doing
[21:43] so I believe it's a beginning of a
[21:45] Revival uh brother Branham said every
[21:48] every uh generation is Promised their
[21:51] Revival
[21:52] so that means our kids and our grandkids
[21:55] as many as the Lord Our God shall call
[21:59] and so I believe that God is doing
[22:02] something not only here
[22:04] but universally globally around the
[22:07] world he's getting his bride ready a
[22:09] Rapture Ready
[22:12] how many of you have a request and say
[22:14] just remember me tonight God bless you
[22:16] let's just bow our heads together
[22:18] Heavenly Father Lord you see those hands
[22:22] both of my hands are up father tonight I
[22:25] realize I am a needy person I need you
[22:28] father but it is the need that makes you
[22:31] God because sometimes father when we got
[22:34] no need and and we're just going along
[22:37] and all life is easy and everything we
[22:40] kind of get lethargy we get a little
[22:42] lukewarm we get a little complacent but
[22:46] then it comes on a a need a time and
[22:49] there's a pressure and a stress and it
[22:51] puts us on our knees and father we know
[22:54] that you do that
[22:56] and you you do that that you will keep
[22:59] our lives ready and father you said
[23:03] sometimes it takes desperation to bring
[23:06] God on the scene but you're always there
[23:09] you know every purpose you know
[23:11] everything that we go through and father
[23:14] I commit this service these prayer
[23:17] requests our brother Neil uh little
[23:20] Josiah little Theo
[23:23] each and every one that has a need
[23:25] whether it be spiritual or physical we
[23:29] just claim that you're Jehovah Jireh in
[23:32] Jesus Christ's name
[23:34] amen amen God bless you Brother David
[23:38] you may be seated brother Elias savola
[23:40] if you'll get ready we're going to sing
[23:42] a song we practiced if you know this
[23:44] song it's called nothing without you I
[23:47] believe you've heard it before we
[23:48] practice this at our musicians meeting
[23:50] and
[23:51] see if you know it sing out loud it's a
[23:53] beautiful song it's a song of surrender
[23:56] without him

[24:05] that let's just sing this oh take these

[48:56] turn to the Book of Jeremiah the first
[48:58] chapter uh first and while we're turning
[49:01] there we want to greet you all on behalf
[49:03] of our pastor brother Sean Martin the
[49:05] Saints there at Faith Tabernacle in
[49:06] Blacksburg Virginia uh send their
[49:08] greetings to you as well this evening
[49:09] and we sure counted an honor and
[49:11] privilege to be here with you all this
[49:13] evening and to be with brother Ron and
[49:14] sister Sandy we sure enjoyed the
[49:16] fellowship today and I tell you it's a
[49:18] real honor to be together with the bride
[49:20] of Jesus Christ and looking across the
[49:22] congregation I see many familiar faces
[49:24] so I'm not going to start trying to call
[49:26] names so we just say God bless you all
[49:28] this evening but I am going to say it's
[49:29] good to see brother Lindsay amen is a
[49:31] bit of a surprise when I pulled up and
[49:32] saw you getting out of the car and I
[49:34] thought why in the world is Lindsey
[49:36] McGrady here and then it dawned on me
[49:37] he's got family here so amen it sure is
[49:40] good to see you and Sharon God bless you
[49:41] all and been knowing brother Lindsay man
[49:43] he's been hearing me and knowing me
[49:45] preaching I first started in one of the
[49:47] first places we ministered was in his
[49:49] assembly and we sure appreciate brother
[49:50] and sister McGrady and sure glad to have
[49:52] my wife here with me this evening and
[49:54] our little boy Malachi and I'll just
[49:56] tell you like I tell everybody if you
[49:58] haven't seen him yet hold on you'll hear
[49:59] him in a few minutes
[50:00] hey man so we we're sure glad to have
[50:02] them here with us this evening and we
[50:04] want to look here in the book of
[50:05] Jeremiah the first chapter
[50:07] and the fourth verse
[50:09] Jeremiah the first chapter in the fourth
[50:11] verse
[50:15] the Bible says then the word of the Lord
[50:17] came unto me saying
[50:19] before I form thee in thy belly I knew
[50:22] thee and before thou camest forth out of
[50:25] the womb I Sanctified thee and I
[50:27] ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations
[50:29] then said I ah Lord God behold I cannot
[50:32] speak for I am a child but the Lord said
[50:35] unto me say not I am a child for Thou
[50:37] shalt go to all that I shall send thee
[50:39] and whatsoever I command thee Thou shalt
[50:42] speak be not afraid of their faces for I
[50:44] am with thee to deliver thee saith the
[50:46] Lord and then the Lord put forth his
[50:48] hand and touched my mouth and the Lord
[50:50] said unto me behold I have put my words
[50:53] in thy mouth behold I have put my words
[50:56] in thy mouth so it was not the words of
[50:58] Jeremiah it was the words of God now
[51:01] watch see I have this day set thee over
[51:04] the Nations over the kingdoms to root
[51:06] out and to pull down and to destroy and
[51:09] to throw down to build and to plant so
[51:12] the words that was coming in Jeremiah's
[51:14] mouth had the power to tear down to root
[51:17] out to destroy Amen to throw down but
[51:20] those same words had the power to build
[51:22] up and to plant amen we want to also
[51:25] look in the Book of Daniel the ninth
[51:27] chapter
[51:28] The Book of Daniel the ninth chapter and
[51:30] I pray you forgive me for reading so
[51:32] many scriptures here in opening but just
[51:34] a few things here on my heart I pray the
[51:36] Lord help us to tie together and Daniel
[51:39] the ninth chapter we know that the Book
[51:41] of Daniel is like the Book of Revelation
[51:43] in the New Testament it's a book of
[51:45] symbols and you come here to the ninth
[51:47] chapter and in the first verse it says
[51:49] in the first year of Darius the son of
[51:51] assurance of the seed of the medes which
[51:54] was made King over the realm of the
[51:55] Chaldeans in the first year of his Reign
[51:58] now watch this Daniel understood my
[52:01] books the number of the years were of
[52:03] the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah
[52:06] the prophet Jeremiah was ordained a
[52:08] prophet the Jeremiah the prophet and he
[52:10] would accomplish 70 years in the
[52:12] desolations of Jerusalem now whatever he
[52:15] was reading had an impact on him because
[52:18] the very next verse says and I set my
[52:20] face into the Lord God to seek by prayer
[52:23] and supplication with fasting and
[52:25] sackcloth and Ashes so whatever he was
[52:29] reading in those books moved him into
[52:30] desperation before God now the last
[52:33] place I want to look with you is in the
[52:35] New Testament John the 15th chapter
[52:37] John the 15th chapter and I want to pull
[52:40] the word from Jeremiah 1. of ordained to
[52:45] John 15 and verse 16.
[52:47] and Jesus here is speaking of the the
[52:50] vine the branches and he says in the
[52:52] 16th verse now ye have not chosen me
[52:56] but I have chosen you
[52:58] and ordained you that you should go and
[53:01] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[53:04] should remain that whatsoever ye shall
[53:06] ask of the father in my name he may give
[53:09] it to you we ask Lord this evening to
[53:12] add the blessing to the reading of his
[53:13] word as you can have your seats here
[53:15] this afternoon for just a few moments I
[53:17] want to about the help of the Lord and
[53:20] if I title this sermon tonight I want to
[53:22] speak to you on ordained to the message
[53:24] by the spirit ordained to the message by
[53:27] the spirit I I believe the hour has come
[53:30] uh to preach the people of God into
[53:32] higher Heights and deeper depths of the
[53:35] love of God of the knowledge of God of
[53:37] the revelation of God and of the word
[53:39] that he has sent us in this hour I
[53:41] believe that the time has come Amen to
[53:43] bring a stability to the Church of the
[53:45] Living God and the only thing that can
[53:47] bring a stability to the believer is the
[53:49] word right that's the only thing that
[53:51] will bring a stability to the believer
[53:53] is the word now the prophet of God said
[53:55] is we ministers he said we are to
[53:57] establish the people think of it as
[53:59] today he said we don't try to establish
[54:01] the word of God in the people's hearts
[54:02] he said we're trying to establish
[54:04] ourselves churches are trying to
[54:05] establish the doctrine of the church in
[54:07] a person's heart but we are commanded to
[54:10] establish the word of God Amen we are
[54:12] commanded Paul said I didn't come to you
[54:14] with enticing words of man that your
[54:16] faith might rest up in the knowledge of
[54:18] man but I I come to you in the power in
[54:20] the manifestation of the Holy Ghost that
[54:22] your faith might rest in God so Paul
[54:25] amen was not placing your faith on him
[54:27] he was placing your faith in his word
[54:30] that's why Peter would come along and
[54:31] say I would not you be negligent to put
[54:33] you always in remembrance of these
[54:35] things though you know them amen but be
[54:38] established in present truth now we all
[54:40] know that there is a past there is a
[54:42] present and there is a future amen and
[54:44] Paul here is saying or Peter Heather
[54:46] he's saying amen be established Amen in
[54:48] the present truth now where the Lord
[54:51] begin to deal with my heart on this
[54:52] sermon I was reading here and heard this
[54:54] quote and does God ever change his mind
[54:56] about his word brother man was actually
[54:57] ordaining some brothers to the ministry
[54:59] and he says here anybody know brother
[55:01] Merlin Anthony he is new to me oh with
[55:04] the Salvation Army oh yes from the
[55:06] Salvation Army that's right I remember
[55:07] him sure I know him his face didn't look
[55:10] familiar but I know him see he's a man
[55:12] of God he said now how many believes
[55:14] that God is working with him raise your
[55:15] hand amen will you pray for him amen now
[55:18] now he says now brother we know that
[55:20] you're coming from a great group of
[55:21] people Salvation Army there are great
[55:23] people they do a great workout on the
[55:25] street we can say nothing against the
[55:27] Nazarene we can say nothing against the
[55:29] Pentecostal church or the Salvation Army
[55:31] or any of them or they're our Brethren
[55:33] but you see we believe that we are
[55:35] carriers of a great message for this
[55:37] very hour that we're living in now do
[55:39] you want to do that with us and the
[55:40] brother says amen amen now I find it
[55:43] amazing when you study through those
[55:45] ordinations of a prophet he's making it
[55:47] very clear that he's not ordaining these
[55:49] men to preach denominational Doctrine
[55:51] he's not ordaining them amen to be a
[55:54] continuation of the Salvation Army or
[55:56] the Pentecostals or the Nazarene but
[55:58] he's ordaining them amen to preach
[56:00] Christ as he has been revealed through
[56:02] this end time message and I I'll say it
[56:04] as plain as I know how amen this message
[56:06] has brought Christ back in the church I
[56:09] mean amen it's not a bunch of laws it's
[56:11] not a bunch of dues it's not a bunch of
[56:12] adults amen but it is the power of the
[56:15] resurrected Lord Jesus amen in the midst
[56:17] of his church in the the age that we're
[56:19] living in therefore amen I don't believe
[56:21] that God through a prophet was just
[56:23] ordained him Amen brother Merlin Anthony
[56:25] or any of them other ministers there
[56:27] that he was praying for but I believe
[56:28] amen that this ordination went beyond
[56:31] just a Ministry amen but it coming to a
[56:33] bride therefore amen we have not been
[56:35] ordained upon the Earth to be a
[56:38] continuation of some Society or a
[56:40] continuation amen of some man's idea but
[56:43] we have been ordained by the spirit amen
[56:45] to be a carrier of this end time message
[56:47] from God the prophet of God said
[56:49] speaking to Moses he said talk about
[56:51] persevering well he walks right up there
[56:53] in the face of pharaoh and he said let
[56:55] them go see he had talked face to face
[56:57] with God Amen until he had his
[57:00] commission and I think if Minister
[57:01] brother today should not take it from an
[57:04] intellectual standpoint but would find
[57:05] them a place on the backside of the
[57:07] desert on those sacred Sands where Satan
[57:10] cannot place his dirty feet of unbelief
[57:12] and stay there until a message comes
[57:14] from God and positionally places you in
[57:16] the ministry then all that Devils out of
[57:19] Torment could not shake you from him
[57:20] amen you know you are called now watch a
[57:23] prophet turn it from the ministry and
[57:25] say I think each Christian ought to do
[57:26] that before you come out and confess the
[57:29] Holy Ghost confess the baptism there
[57:31] ought to be such a personal contact with
[57:33] God Amen until all the intellectuals in
[57:36] the world could not explain it from you
[57:37] amen because you know you've been there
[57:40] you've had the witness you know it's so
[57:42] amen what did Jesus tell his disciples
[57:45] he said go wait into city of Jerusalem
[57:47] until you are endued with power not from
[57:50] the bishop amen not from the Cardinal
[57:52] but from on high amen then where was the
[57:55] power coming from the power amen was
[57:57] coming from the Holy Ghost it was coming
[57:59] from heaven and may I announced to you
[58:01] tonight that we are not here amen are
[58:03] helpless hopeless confused amen weak
[58:06] beat down powerless bunch of church
[58:07] members amen but the same power that
[58:10] filled the upper room amen has returned
[58:12] into the Church of the Living God Amen
[58:14] and it hasn't come by the Baptist
[58:16] Doctrine hasn't come by the Pentecostal
[58:18] Doctrine but it has come by first save
[58:20] the evening time message listen friends
[58:22] we are not carrying a bunch of Creeds we
[58:24] are not caring about your dogmas we are
[58:26] carrying body changing power amen that
[58:28] some morning between six and nine amen
[58:31] the very atoms of our bodies are going
[58:32] to be changed well I might as well
[58:34] preach I'm here amen the time to preach
[58:36] this message is not coming it's here
[58:38] amen the time to enjoy the blessings of
[58:41] the Holy Ghost it's not coming it is
[58:43] here people say well someday somehow or
[58:45] sometime amen but I say if not now then
[58:48] when and somebody said well somebody I
[58:50] say if not you amen then who amen
[58:53] there's not another age coming there's
[58:55] not another message coming there's not
[58:57] another Prophet coming you are the final
[58:59] voice to the final age amen underneath
[59:02] your messenger oh I say oh God fill us
[59:05] with the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost or
[59:07] we can't do nothing amen but give our
[59:09] lives to this end time message amen give
[59:11] our families to it give our Ministries
[59:13] to give everything we are to this
[59:15] message friends amen I don't want to
[59:17] hurt your feelings but I got to say what
[59:18] brother Brown said I am responsible for
[59:21] a message and that message he has come
[59:23] out of this mess the message of the hour
[59:26] has come out of this mess and if I ask
[59:28] you to come out then where am I going to
[59:30] take you to see if I would take it at
[59:32] random Tabernacle he said it's as much
[59:34] fault as he and the rest of them but
[59:35] there's only one place I know I can take
[59:37] you that it is safe and protected from
[59:40] death and he said that's in Jesus Christ
[59:43] which is God's place of worship listen
[59:46] I'm not carrying you tonight amen out
[59:48] into the Realms of emotion I'm not
[59:50] carrying you tonight out into the Realms
[59:51] of feelings or Sensations or gifts amen
[59:54] but let the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[59:56] amen lift you up into a dimension with
[59:59] this word where you can see what a
[1:00:00] prophet's saying and Faith Can strike
[1:00:02] your heart and say if he said it I
[1:00:05] believe it that sales it and I'm going
[1:00:07] to claim it and there ain't enough
[1:00:08] devils in Hell there ain't enough devils
[1:00:10] in this room there ain't enough Spirits
[1:00:12] against me behind me or around me that
[1:00:14] will defeat a centered daughter of God
[1:00:16] on their way to meet promise of God let
[1:00:19] me just go ahead and say it you didn't
[1:00:20] stumble in this message you was ordained
[1:00:22] to it
[1:00:23] you didn't stumble into this church you
[1:00:25] was ordained to it you didn't stumble
[1:00:27] underneath the teachings of a word
[1:00:28] Prophet you
[1:00:30] Dane to this message now I love what
[1:00:32] Jeremiah says there he said before I
[1:00:34] form thee God says I knew thee in the
[1:00:36] belly and before thou camest forth have
[1:00:38] a womb amen I Sanctified thee and I
[1:00:40] ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations
[1:00:42] look at this word ordained it means to
[1:00:45] give it means to bestow it means to
[1:00:47] Grant it means to permit subscribe
[1:00:49] employee devote consecrate amen dedicate
[1:00:53] commit and trust or to give over amen so
[1:00:56] God is telling Jeremiah before I ever
[1:00:59] even informed you in the womb of your
[1:01:01] mother amen I gave you to a message amen
[1:01:03] before I ever brought you out of the
[1:01:05] womb of your Earthly mother I ordained
[1:01:08] you amen a prophet to the name listen
[1:01:10] God did not wait till Jeremiah was born
[1:01:12] and come down in the birthing room and
[1:01:14] say man he looks like a prophet amen man
[1:01:17] he looks like somebody that'll do
[1:01:18] something for me amen but before there
[1:01:20] was one Adam or one molecule Amen in the
[1:01:23] back part of God's mind amen Jeremiah
[1:01:26] was already laying there amen just
[1:01:28] waiting for the time of manifestation
[1:01:30] and may I say that same predestination
[1:01:32] did not stop at Jeremiah and it didn't
[1:01:35] stop at Paul and it didn't stop it
[1:01:36] William Branham but that same ordination
[1:01:39] of God has followed you into this age
[1:01:41] and it coming to you by a gene seed amen
[1:01:44] your father didn't have nothing to do
[1:01:46] with it amen your mother didn't have
[1:01:47] nothing to do with it amen but God who
[1:01:50] is rich in Mercy amen placed a seed on
[1:01:52] the inside of your soul and ordained you
[1:01:55] for a Time such as man y'all got to
[1:01:57] forgive me there's a preaching anointing
[1:01:58] in here tonight amen it's a Time Amen to
[1:02:01] believe this message amen you you are
[1:02:03] not a trespasser amen when the Holy
[1:02:05] Ghost comes in your services and starts
[1:02:07] moving like her brother Ron was talking
[1:02:09] about amen you ain't got to stay on the
[1:02:11] outside of that amen that's a sovereign
[1:02:13] move of the almighty God Amen you got
[1:02:16] rights in the Holy Ghost you got rights
[1:02:18] to have hands wait on you you got rights
[1:02:20] to have Devils cast out of you you got
[1:02:22] rights to speak the word you got rights
[1:02:24] to believe God still heals cancer
[1:02:26] oh you got rights in the Holy Ghost amen
[1:02:29] because before you was ever even brought
[1:02:31] here God said he knew you he Sanctified
[1:02:33] you amen said before he ever come from
[1:02:37] his mother's womb in other words
[1:02:38] Jeremiah was born on the Earth for a
[1:02:41] specific purpose
[1:02:43] he was not born for a haphazard purpose
[1:02:46] he was born
[1:02:47] a purpose now in John 1 12 the Bible
[1:02:50] said as many as received him Amen to
[1:02:53] them gave him power thank you brother to
[1:02:54] become the sons of God even to them that
[1:02:57] believe on his name now watch how they
[1:03:00] were born not of blood or of the will of
[1:03:02] Flesh nor the will of man but of God now
[1:03:05] I don't have time to take you through
[1:03:06] all the scriptures that shows you God's
[1:03:08] people they've been born for a specific
[1:03:10] purpose amen but brother Branham said
[1:03:12] Moses was born for a specific purpose he
[1:03:15] said his specific purpose was to deliver
[1:03:17] Israel from the bondage of the Egyptian
[1:03:20] do you realize Israel had a specific
[1:03:22] purpose upon their life and that was
[1:03:24] they would have the cleanest bloodstream
[1:03:26] amen for out of that bloodstream brother
[1:03:28] Warren amen would come the Messiah amen
[1:03:31] now we can leave Moses and Israel and we
[1:03:33] can come to Jesus and he said no man can
[1:03:36] come to me except the father draws him
[1:03:37] first see it's nothing you can do about
[1:03:40] it amen Jesus didn't come to Calvary he
[1:03:43] meant to die for a haphazard purpose he
[1:03:45] didn't come there and say well maybe
[1:03:47] I'll die and it'll be so pathetic some
[1:03:49] people will see that I died and maybe
[1:03:51] they'll come and serve the Lord no Jesus
[1:03:53] came for a specific purpose Amen to
[1:03:56] redeem those who God by for now that's
[1:03:59] elected to come to him listen Jesus
[1:04:01] didn't go to Calvary by accident amen
[1:04:04] Jesus didn't stumble amen up on Mount
[1:04:06] Calvary amen by just some coincidence
[1:04:08] amen but before the foundation of the
[1:04:11] world Amen four thousand years in the
[1:04:13] mind of God he was the lamb that was
[1:04:15] slain from before the foundation of the
[1:04:18] world Amen remember said it took four
[1:04:20] thousand years amen for that vision of
[1:04:22] the Lamb being slain Amen to come into
[1:04:24] materialization he said but it came and
[1:04:27] he said the same vision has been spoken
[1:04:29] over the church listen I don't know how
[1:04:31] long it'll take amen for Visions to
[1:04:33] materialize amen but you better back
[1:04:36] every devil up in the corner and remind
[1:04:38] that devil it's going to happen no
[1:04:40] matter if it's four minutes four hours
[1:04:42] four days four months four years or for
[1:04:44] a thousand years amen what God has
[1:04:47] determined will be accomplished well
[1:04:50] it's not of him that willeth it's not of
[1:04:52] him that runeth but it is God that
[1:04:54] showeth Mercy then I can say it like
[1:04:56] this Moses had a specific purpose amen
[1:04:59] amen Israel had a Pacific purpose amen
[1:05:01] Jesus had a specific purpose well let's
[1:05:04] bring it on an evening tonight
[1:05:05] Fellowship amen you have got a specific
[1:05:07] purpose amen God did not make you and I
[1:05:10] just deceived if he could do it he made
[1:05:12] us for a purpose see you're here for a
[1:05:15] specific purpose no matter how little
[1:05:17] you are how big you are how unimportant
[1:05:20] you are you are here to serve a purpose
[1:05:23] just as my finger is here that's my nail
[1:05:25] on my fingers for a purpose my eye every
[1:05:28] part of our body is to serve a purpose
[1:05:30] it was not put here just to see what it
[1:05:33] would look like when it was put here but
[1:05:34] it was put here to serve its purpose it
[1:05:37] was God's divine plan to do so and if
[1:05:41] you were put here for a purpose amen
[1:05:43] then there is nothing somebody say
[1:05:44] nothing amen God bless you brother make
[1:05:47] it been a long time amen amen there is
[1:05:50] nothing can destroy amen until God's
[1:05:52] purpose is fulfilled amen nothing can
[1:05:55] harm us until the purpose that God has
[1:05:58] put us here for has been made manifest
[1:06:01] amen you ought to you ought to write
[1:06:02] that quote down and read it to the devil
[1:06:04] every morning you get out of bed amen
[1:06:06] there is nothing that devil can do amen
[1:06:09] there's nothing cancer can do there is
[1:06:12] nothing sickness can do there's nothing
[1:06:14] Church disagreements can do there's
[1:06:16] nothing politics or governments or
[1:06:18] nations amen there's nothing
[1:06:19] denomination can do Amen to defeat the
[1:06:22] purpose of God it's the infallible in
[1:06:25] person it's a perfect purpose and all
[1:06:27] hell can't defeat him then I'll say it
[1:06:29] to you like this what God calls you to
[1:06:30] be you'll be it come on you can run from
[1:06:33] it but you can't hide amen David said I
[1:06:36] can make my bed in the belly of Hell
[1:06:38] amen but he'll be there amen because of
[1:06:41] God by predestination has wrapped
[1:06:43] according to prophecy around your soul
[1:06:46] amen you can't outrun the predestination
[1:06:48] of God you can't outrun the
[1:06:50] foreknowledge of God it is sovereign
[1:06:54] what if God wants a certain thing he
[1:06:56] said that he brings you to the Earth to
[1:06:58] be that and you'll be it amen he brings
[1:07:00] you to the Earth to be that and you'll
[1:07:02] be it see if he called you to do a thing
[1:07:05] then when my God calls he calls by a
[1:07:07] Divine call
[1:07:09] when God calls you he calls you by a
[1:07:12] Divine call I said like this then God
[1:07:14] called you and ordained You by his
[1:07:17] spirit amen to this message in first
[1:07:20] John 1 5 I love what the Bible said this
[1:07:23] then is the message which we have heard
[1:07:25] of him and declare unto you that God is
[1:07:28] light
[1:07:29] and in him is no Darkness at all see
[1:07:33] look at this word message it is an
[1:07:35] announcement it is a promise it is the
[1:07:37] promise given to be given it is a
[1:07:39] promised good or blessing amen it is
[1:07:42] something that has been promised amen
[1:07:44] being manifested now the prophet of God
[1:07:46] said why it had to be separate the
[1:07:47] highest of Heaven came down to make
[1:07:49] yourself known to the lowest of the
[1:07:51] earth amen bypassing all them to make
[1:07:54] himself known to the common herdsmen
[1:07:55] amen coming to give these common
[1:07:57] herdsmen amen the greatest message Of
[1:08:00] All Times amen God bypass Scholars he
[1:08:04] bypassed nobleman he bypassed he
[1:08:06] bypassed Kings and monarchs and
[1:08:08] potentates and learn men amen but here
[1:08:10] he comes to the lowest amen with the
[1:08:13] greatest of all messages and you know
[1:08:15] what that message was it was Messiah is
[1:08:18] here now amen then the greatest did not
[1:08:20] choose the best Amen to announce his
[1:08:23] arrival amen but he bypassed the best
[1:08:25] and he went over to the hills Amen to
[1:08:28] Bethlehem Judea and he on some Shepherds
[1:08:31] out there that were just tending their
[1:08:32] flocks amen they had no education they
[1:08:35] had no Fellowship card they had no
[1:08:37] recognition amen but on the inside of
[1:08:39] them they had a seed of God that was
[1:08:42] ordained from the foundation of the
[1:08:43] world Amen and that seed was ordained to
[1:08:46] do one thing it was not to be this or to
[1:08:48] be that it was to stand in the face of
[1:08:51] humanity and declare Messiah is here now
[1:08:53] let me just go and say it amen Our God
[1:08:56] didn't go to Bob Jones and he didn't go
[1:08:58] to Liberty University and he didn't go
[1:09:00] to the best societies amen but he come
[1:09:02] down to a bunch of nobodies amen who was
[1:09:04] born in sin shaping inequity he was on
[1:09:07] the road to Hell come on he took drug
[1:09:09] dealers and prostitutes Amen in serious
[1:09:12] psychotic people and he changed them by
[1:09:14] the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost amen and
[1:09:16] put him into a position by the authority
[1:09:19] of the Holy Ghost Amen to announce to
[1:09:21] this lost and Dying World the Messiah is
[1:09:23] here and if he's here then he's here to
[1:09:26] do something he's here to save he's here
[1:09:29] to heal he's here to deliver he's here
[1:09:31] to bring the captive out of captivity oh
[1:09:34] God past the nobodies
[1:09:37] God bypassed the nobodies and come down
[1:09:40] to some oh my my pastor somebody's come
[1:09:44] to nobody's to declare the key message
[1:09:46] you say what is this key message it is
[1:09:49] the announcement that God is not dead
[1:09:52] it is the announcement that God is not
[1:09:56] dead then the prophet said the layout of
[1:09:58] sin age my I'm trying to lay a
[1:09:59] foundation he always preaching me the
[1:10:01] layout of sin age is supposed to receive
[1:10:04] a message he said see in Malachi 4 said
[1:10:07] they would then can I say what a prophet
[1:10:09] said he said we as this group of people
[1:10:11] we have a message for this day and we
[1:10:15] believe that God has given us a message
[1:10:17] that we are not looking for a message we
[1:10:20] have on
[1:10:21] we are not looking for something to
[1:10:24] follow we have been ordained to follow
[1:10:26] the leadership of the Vindicated word
[1:10:28] now people sometimes say what is this
[1:10:30] you mean amen by the message of the hour
[1:10:33] well thank god a prophet defined it he
[1:10:35] said what they are getting at is it's
[1:10:37] God's promise of this hour that he
[1:10:39] promised what he would do the message of
[1:10:42] the hour is God's promise of what he
[1:10:45] promised he would do in this hour
[1:10:47] recognize your Danish message don't you
[1:10:49] see the message of the hour can you
[1:10:52] recognize where we are the message
[1:10:54] itself the message itself from the
[1:10:57] scripture interprets to you the hour
[1:11:00] that we're living in amen last time he
[1:11:02] preaches modern events made clear by
[1:11:04] prophecy what does he say he said if you
[1:11:06] want to know what month you're in look
[1:11:08] at the calendar if you want to know what
[1:11:09] age you're in look at the Bible amen the
[1:11:12] calendar is a sign of the natural time
[1:11:14] amen but the Bible is the spiritual
[1:11:17] announcement of the age you're living
[1:11:18] now come on church amen because we
[1:11:21] didn't know where we were that we didn't
[1:11:23] know where we were going we didn't know
[1:11:24] where we come from amen but God rich in
[1:11:27] Mercy amen new there was a people on the
[1:11:29] Earth that would be living in the
[1:11:31] closing hours of time when Time and
[1:11:33] Eternity would be blending together and
[1:11:35] there would be at this house can I say
[1:11:37] it to you like this the desire to see
[1:11:39] Jesus would return to the church
[1:11:42] that would be why what did he preach
[1:11:45] over and over amen search we would see
[1:11:47] Jesus amen why because Zacchaeus amen
[1:11:50] desired to see him right he said what
[1:11:52] did Zacchaeus do amen he climbed up a
[1:11:55] sycamore tree and he said where did he
[1:11:57] go he found where there were two limbs
[1:11:59] that come together and he met at the
[1:12:00] truck of the tree and there he sat down
[1:12:03] he said now that's a good place to sit
[1:12:05] amen were two ways meet he said that's
[1:12:08] yours and gods amen your idea and his
[1:12:11] amen can I say this amen this church is
[1:12:14] a good place to sit down and let your
[1:12:16] ideas and God's ideas meet
[1:12:19] come on Amen a good Wednesday night
[1:12:21] service it's a good place to sit down
[1:12:24] amen under the auspices of the revealed
[1:12:26] word of the hour that you're living in
[1:12:28] under the anointing of the music under
[1:12:30] the anoints of the preaching it's a good
[1:12:32] place to sit down and let your ideas
[1:12:34] come across God's ideas amen your own
[1:12:37] thoughts about him and what his word
[1:12:39] says He is amen what you think he is and
[1:12:42] what the word says he is I love this one
[1:12:44] brother Ron what the message of the hour
[1:12:46] is to your own thinking and what the
[1:12:49] message of the hour is to his word
[1:12:51] now I know a lot of people got a lot of
[1:12:53] different ideas about what the message
[1:12:55] is and what I have found amen is there
[1:12:57] not always God's word ideas they're
[1:13:00] their own ideas but the difference is
[1:13:02] amen is it coming from the word or is it
[1:13:04] coming from your ideas
[1:13:06] now let's just say what brother Branham
[1:13:08] said he said we've not come together to
[1:13:10] talk about the message but we are come
[1:13:12] together to get in the message see and
[1:13:15] the message is Christ come on it's not a
[1:13:19] book it's not a belt buckle it's not a
[1:13:21] replica of a briefcase it's not a museum
[1:13:23] the message is Christ I know men have
[1:13:27] reduced it down to doctrines amen but
[1:13:30] the message is Christ I know they've
[1:13:32] reduced it down to little points to fuss
[1:13:34] and argue on Amen but young people don't
[1:13:36] you ever forget this message amen is not
[1:13:39] an argument it's not a debate it's not a
[1:13:41] bunch of preachers it's not a bunch of
[1:13:43] personalities this message is Jesus
[1:13:46] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:13:49] forever and I can hear the prophet's
[1:13:51] voice as he screams out my commission to
[1:13:53] this earth it's the forerun the coming
[1:13:55] word which will prepare the bride amen
[1:13:58] for the second going of the church of
[1:14:00] living listen friends we're not going to
[1:14:02] stay here I know things are hard right
[1:14:04] now I know times are difficult right now
[1:14:07] amen but get your eyes off of time get
[1:14:10] your eyes off a situation get your eyes
[1:14:12] off of circumstances and get your eyes
[1:14:14] back on this message and let it refresh
[1:14:17] you let it renew you let it revive you
[1:14:21] hallelujah it's the message of the hour
[1:14:24] and I think we ought to lay out for red
[1:14:26] carpet and welcome it back in our
[1:14:28] churches
[1:14:29] well brother Andrew you're getting too
[1:14:31] far out there I don't think I got far
[1:14:32] enough yet
[1:14:33] the message is Christ
[1:14:37] I'll go to the farthest limb of the tree
[1:14:39] to scream it the message is Christ
[1:14:42] now the prophet said that if he is the
[1:14:44] word then what are we to do we're to get
[1:14:46] into it
[1:14:47] laughs
[1:14:49] so the message is Christ and we're to
[1:14:52] get into the message now the next part
[1:14:54] is one I love he says get beneath it
[1:14:58] so when you get in the message you're
[1:15:01] not standing next to it
[1:15:04] is this okay you're not standing above
[1:15:06] it trying to add your ideas to it but
[1:15:10] you're getting beneath it
[1:15:11] in other words it's become your headship
[1:15:14] it's become your compass it's become
[1:15:18] your direction it's become your vision
[1:15:20] it's become your focus see when we get
[1:15:23] beneath it that's what we're supposed to
[1:15:25] do now the prophet said that the message
[1:15:28] is Christ and Christ is the word and God
[1:15:32] is his word now the prophet of God tells
[1:15:35] us amen that God then is perfected in
[1:15:37] threes right
[1:15:39] he said father son Holy Ghost water
[1:15:41] blood spirit God is perfected in threes
[1:15:44] then I love the way we see this amen
[1:15:46] that the message which is Christ has
[1:15:49] come to the church amen in three pulls
[1:15:51] is that okay has come to the church in
[1:15:54] three pools now I did a study some time
[1:15:56] ago and I don't have time to give it to
[1:15:58] you all right now but I just want to
[1:15:59] preach it from my heart he said it like
[1:16:01] this is this a sign of the unserved he
[1:16:03] said now is this that third pull that he
[1:16:05] told me three or four years ago see the
[1:16:08] first pull you remember what happened I
[1:16:09] tried to explain it and he said don't do
[1:16:11] it he said then the second poll don't
[1:16:13] try and I put anyhow then he said now
[1:16:15] there's a third pool coming now say that
[1:16:18] with me a third pull comment he said now
[1:16:20] there's a third pull coming but don't
[1:16:23] try to explain it you see how I
[1:16:25] approached this tonight I don't know but
[1:16:27] I feel Duty bound to my church to say
[1:16:29] something and you draw your own
[1:16:31] conclusion now watch him turn and say
[1:16:34] the works that I do amen more than this
[1:16:36] how you do he said King James says
[1:16:38] greater but you couldn't do nothing
[1:16:40] greater he said what was it it was more
[1:16:42] of it he said see he was in one person
[1:16:44] then he's in the whole church now amen
[1:16:48] back then he was in one person doing the
[1:16:51] works of the father amen but now he has
[1:16:53] come into a body a Church of the Living
[1:16:56] God he said if this is the third pull
[1:16:59] amen then there is a great ministry line
[1:17:01] ahead I don't know I can't say I don't
[1:17:05] know so right there he identifies he
[1:17:07] meant the third pull is coming and if
[1:17:09] this is the third pool that's coming
[1:17:11] there's a great ministry lying ahead
[1:17:13] then he comes to the indictment and says
[1:17:15] may there come forth a Revival of the
[1:17:17] just and a great power come among the
[1:17:19] church just before it's going it's not
[1:17:21] hard to pray that amen because you
[1:17:24] promised it can I just stop here and say
[1:17:26] this amen we don't have to beat a
[1:17:28] Revival out of this carpet
[1:17:30] come on we don't come on church we don't
[1:17:32] have to be the Revival out of this altar
[1:17:34] amen we don't have to pull a Revival out
[1:17:36] of midair somewhere amen but there's a
[1:17:38] Revival in the word amen the bride's
[1:17:41] Revival it's not a Revival of singing
[1:17:43] It's not a Revival of just emotion the
[1:17:46] bride's Revival is a word Revival come
[1:17:49] on y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:17:50] they've been this bride's Revival Burns
[1:17:52] in the darkest of nights this bride's
[1:17:54] Revival Burns amen when the bills are
[1:17:56] paid and when you're in the negative
[1:17:58] this bride's Revival Burns amen when
[1:18:01] you're well and it burns when you're
[1:18:02] sick amen because it's not a Revival
[1:18:05] amen can I preach a minute it's not a
[1:18:07] Revival amen that is controlled by the
[1:18:10] thermostat of the conditions of the
[1:18:12] church and then the church might be cold
[1:18:14] but if you got this word on the inside
[1:18:16] of your soul it'll break out on a
[1:18:18] Wednesday night if you got this word
[1:18:20] inside of you you can receive the
[1:18:22] darkest and darkest reports and in the
[1:18:25] middle of the darkest child of your life
[1:18:26] this revival will break out in you and
[1:18:29] it'll be a whale spring it up it'll be
[1:18:31] joy unspeakable it'll be full of Glory
[1:18:34] it'll be fire in the cold season come on
[1:18:37] it's the word
[1:18:39] come on that's why we can show up and
[1:18:42] can't have our favorite singer and we're
[1:18:44] still in Revival
[1:18:46] well I feel good that's why we can show
[1:18:49] up amen and not have our fancy playing
[1:18:51] and still have Revival because the
[1:18:54] Revival is in the word so the the
[1:18:57] prophet said it's not hard to pray for
[1:18:59] that because you promised it see we're
[1:19:00] looking for that third pull third pull
[1:19:02] coming third pool will do great things
[1:19:05] we're looking for that third pull see
[1:19:07] watch this we know it'll do great things
[1:19:09] in our midst 1963 why Christ speak God
[1:19:12] give me courage
[1:19:14] to take the sword of the word that he
[1:19:16] put in my hand about 33 years ago and
[1:19:20] hold it and marched forward to the third
[1:19:23] pull
[1:19:24] third pool's coming third pool's going
[1:19:26] to do great things in our midst great
[1:19:28] ministry now he's saying amen give me
[1:19:30] the courage to March towards that third
[1:19:32] pool Christ The Mystery 1963. of course
[1:19:35] you being spiritual you watch the
[1:19:37] spiritual things not knowing this but
[1:19:39] God knows it if you'll turn and look at
[1:19:41] the clock it's on the dot two o'clock
[1:19:43] it's the end of the second pool the
[1:19:47] third pool is at hand
[1:19:49] we have now come from the third pull is
[1:19:52] coming to when the third pool comes in
[1:19:53] our midst it's going to do great things
[1:19:55] we have come from the third pool we're
[1:19:57] marching towards it but now he's
[1:19:59] announcing brother Russell we've turned
[1:20:01] the coroner amen the second pull is over
[1:20:03] and the third pull is at hand now we can
[1:20:06] stop there and take those words to
[1:20:08] Daniel 12 where Daniel was commissioned
[1:20:10] by the Lord amen seal up the vision
[1:20:12] Daniel until the time of the end for
[1:20:16] knowledge shall be increased and many
[1:20:18] shall run to and fro amen we can go to
[1:20:20] Revelation 1 3 where John says amen
[1:20:22] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[1:20:24] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[1:20:27] those things which are written therein
[1:20:29] watch for the time he is at hand amen
[1:20:32] the second pull is now over the third
[1:20:34] pull is at hand I'm on church amen that
[1:20:37] third pull amen was sealed in the
[1:20:39] Revelation amen but it could not come
[1:20:41] forth until a specific time when there
[1:20:44] was a specific people that was born for
[1:20:47] a specific purpose oh I don't I don't
[1:20:49] know amen I want to scream it out I was
[1:20:52] born for this third pool I was born for
[1:20:54] this word I was born for this anointed
[1:20:57] amen I wasn't born to be a worked up
[1:20:59] Christian I wasn't born to be up one day
[1:21:01] and down the next I wasn't born to be on
[1:21:03] fire one week and call the next but the
[1:21:05] word has released me from the conditions
[1:21:07] of society and has led me into the
[1:21:10] promised land where all things are
[1:21:12] possible
[1:21:13] foreign
[1:21:20] place of power it's a place of authority
[1:21:22] it's a come on it's the bride's pool
[1:21:26] it's a bride's pool we got an old
[1:21:29] brother back home you probably know him
[1:21:30] brother Lindsay brother Doug he sings an
[1:21:32] old song he wrote it said the bride
[1:21:34] speaks a language that the world can't
[1:21:36] understand I thought oh thank God we
[1:21:39] speak a different language we speak a
[1:21:41] language of power
[1:21:43] we speak a language of stability we
[1:21:46] speak a language of vision because the
[1:21:48] time is at hand see he's safe into me
[1:21:51] still not the Sands of the prophecy of
[1:21:53] this book for the time is at hand now
[1:21:56] watch we immediately learn a principle
[1:21:58] that the revelation of God for each age
[1:22:00] can come in that age only and at a
[1:22:04] specific time now he says history of
[1:22:06] Israel the mo that when Moses came
[1:22:08] specific time Jesus come specific time
[1:22:11] in this layout of sin age the revelation
[1:22:14] of God will come in its due time
[1:22:17] it will not falter and neither will it
[1:22:20] be premature
[1:22:22] glory to God it will not falter and
[1:22:26] neither will it be be premature for we
[1:22:28] are in the end time today so now we can
[1:22:32] say Amen the third pull is coming the
[1:22:35] third pool will do great things give me
[1:22:37] courage to March forward to that third
[1:22:39] poll the third pull is at hand now can
[1:22:41] we say it like a prophet I feel that
[1:22:43] third pool is beginning to move
[1:22:47] you see within me but now watch so now
[1:22:50] I'm going to say something to you and
[1:22:52] this is the thing we've looked forward
[1:22:53] to for so long the third pool has now
[1:22:57] been Vindicated and I'm sure you all
[1:23:00] know what it is he said see only the
[1:23:02] spiritual will catch the third pool the
[1:23:05] third pool is properly identified we
[1:23:07] know where it is come on church amen
[1:23:11] before he was saying we know it's coming
[1:23:12] then he said we know it's at hand he
[1:23:15] said now it's moving within me amen but
[1:23:17] a prophet didn't walk off the scene amen
[1:23:19] with the third post sealed in him and
[1:23:21] for nobody else he said it is so sacred
[1:23:23] I mustn't say much about it amen but the
[1:23:26] third pull is here
[1:23:29] brother the third pull is here he said
[1:23:31] now watch that third pull it'll be
[1:23:33] absolutely to the total loss amen but
[1:23:36] it'll be for the bride for the church
[1:23:39] amen the third pull will be to the total
[1:23:42] lost but it will be for the Bride of the
[1:23:45] church there is no more doubt in my mind
[1:23:47] I know what the third pull is and I know
[1:23:50] what the third pull does he said now be
[1:23:52] revered and be quiet because the hour
[1:23:55] will soon arrive where God is going to
[1:23:57] do some great things you say then what
[1:23:58] is that third pull it's the confirmation
[1:24:01] of the first pull it's the confirmation
[1:24:03] of the second pull he said the third
[1:24:05] poor he said then the spoken word so
[1:24:08] when the third pull come in the church
[1:24:10] it was more than just the flesh
[1:24:12] come on we can preach Body Spirit and
[1:24:14] Soul by the three pulls amen where was
[1:24:16] the first pull it was in his flesh where
[1:24:18] was the second pool it was in the spirit
[1:24:20] connecting with the spirit realm but
[1:24:22] where was that third pull brother Robert
[1:24:24] that third pull was in the soul which
[1:24:27] the soul is the residency of the word
[1:24:31] that's why the devil can't defeat you
[1:24:33] amen because the word of God will defeat
[1:24:35] the Devil anywhere Anytime Anyplace
[1:24:39] under any condition amen this third pool
[1:24:41] is not limited it's the unlimited ride's
[1:24:44] Revival it's the unlimited anointing
[1:24:46] it's the unlimited Authority that has
[1:24:49] come in the church by the spoken word we
[1:24:51] know what the third pull is
[1:24:54] can I keep on going we know what the
[1:24:57] third pull is amen the third pool is
[1:24:59] that great and final pull he said now
[1:25:01] watch the very day when this messenger
[1:25:02] not when he starts out but when he
[1:25:04] begins to declare his message when he
[1:25:08] begins to declare his message when he
[1:25:10] pulls the first time he'll get little
[1:25:12] fish when he pulls the second time he'll
[1:25:15] get more little fish but when he makes
[1:25:16] that third crank when he makes that
[1:25:18] third pull amen the little fish will
[1:25:21] scatter amen but the rainbow trout will
[1:25:23] come
[1:25:25] and you all know what I'm talking about
[1:25:26] amen them little fish had to scatter
[1:25:29] amen cause you all needed some room
[1:25:32] come on Church them little fish had to
[1:25:35] go somewhere else amen this seed had to
[1:25:37] give out of the truck amen because the
[1:25:39] seed needed some room to be deceived
[1:25:40] amen that's why we are not carrying
[1:25:43] Pentecostalism back into this message
[1:25:45] there was no room for this seed there
[1:25:47] was no room for this anointing under a
[1:25:49] Pentecostal idea but underneath a word
[1:25:52] coming to the word amen all things are
[1:25:54] possible listen we'll have to wait for a
[1:25:56] special meeting we don't have to wait
[1:25:57] for a prayer line we don't have to wait
[1:25:59] for a special preacher amen but wherever
[1:26:01] the word has the preeminence there is a
[1:26:04] possibility to see a miracle there is a
[1:26:06] possibility to receive an answer come on
[1:26:08] Church my God is not dead He's Alive and
[1:26:11] he's well
[1:26:14] and he's right here with this bride
[1:26:16] underneath this third pull he said what
[1:26:19] was that first pool healing second
[1:26:20] prophesied but now watch that third pull
[1:26:24] it was the opening of the word
[1:26:27] brother it was the revealing of the
[1:26:31] Mysteries and there's no more higher
[1:26:33] order to reveal the word than prophets
[1:26:35] and remember the third pull
[1:26:38] was the opening of them Seven Seals to
[1:26:41] reveal the hidden truth that's been
[1:26:44] sealed in the word
[1:26:47] now contrary to popular belief this
[1:26:50] third pool was not outside the Bible
[1:26:52] it was in the Bible
[1:26:54] them seals was in the Bible come on
[1:26:57] church but it took a prophet
[1:26:59] to go in that realm and give the
[1:27:01] anointing what are you saying brother
[1:27:03] Andrew I'm saying the third pull is the
[1:27:06] message
[1:27:07] can I get a witness the third pull is
[1:27:10] the message amen I love to shout and
[1:27:12] I'll shout right with you but that's not
[1:27:14] just the message I love to rejoice and
[1:27:16] I'll Rejoice with you amen but that's
[1:27:18] not what's bringing stability the third
[1:27:20] pull is the word it's the message it's
[1:27:23] what brings us stability what are you
[1:27:25] saying I'm saying what the prophet said
[1:27:27] and I've gotten my mind set on this
[1:27:29] message it's that third pull it's the
[1:27:31] one I must be loyal in Reverend to then
[1:27:34] what are you saying I'm saying that the
[1:27:36] message is the opening of the word
[1:27:39] in the church which is making it the
[1:27:42] bride can I say it to you like this you
[1:27:44] are the bride by the word
[1:27:48] you are not the bride by the way you
[1:27:49] feel
[1:27:51] Austin you are not the bride by the way
[1:27:53] things are going come on Church you are
[1:27:55] not the bride by what somebody says
[1:27:57] about you you are the bride by the word
[1:28:01] come on persecution can't put you out
[1:28:04] because persecution didn't put you in
[1:28:06] critics can't put you out because
[1:28:08] critics didn't put you in amen naysayers
[1:28:10] cannot put you out because they did not
[1:28:13] put you in you was brought into this
[1:28:15] word by the third pull anointing and the
[1:28:18] only one that can take you out is the
[1:28:20] one that put you in and his name is the
[1:28:22] Lord Jesus Christ and the way he's going
[1:28:24] to take us out is by changing our bodies
[1:28:27] [Applause]
[1:28:29] by the word that we're feeding on it's
[1:28:31] going to change our bodies some morning
[1:28:34] oh my I I told the devil I was gonna
[1:28:38] read him something so I'm gonna read it
[1:28:39] to him right now identify Christ of all
[1:28:41] ages Heavenly Father we are grateful to

[1:28:47] kinds of Theology and movement but still
[1:28:49] in the darkness of all of it you promise
[1:28:52] you would appear here
[1:28:54] yeah
[1:28:55] in the last days in this Sodom day you

[1:29:23] you was when you talked to the woman at
[1:29:24] the well because it's God manifested in
[1:29:27] flesh now in the flesh of his bride for
[1:29:30] the bride and the husband is the self
[1:29:32] same flesh
[1:29:36] If I Was the Devil I would fight this
[1:29:38] church too if I was the devil I would
[1:29:41] fight you too because you have become
[1:29:43] the word and the word has become your
[1:29:46] flesh

[1:29:50] flesh is becoming the word old church
[1:29:52] and living God don't you see what it is
[1:29:54] it's the ordination of God to you to
[1:29:57] carry this message to be this message
[1:29:59] the church is becoming the bride all the
[1:30:02] time by believing the word so that the
[1:30:04] word and the church becomes the same the
[1:30:07] word in the church making it the bride
[1:30:12] foreign
[1:30:14] the word in the church making it the
[1:30:17] bride
[1:30:19] I can preach here for 20 more minutes
[1:30:21] the word in the church making it the
[1:30:25] bride
[1:30:26] what did the prophet say he said proving
[1:30:28] his word he said you will take the
[1:30:30] Rapture by the word
[1:30:32] now that does something for me brother
[1:30:34] you will take the Rapture by the word
[1:30:37] brother Roberts you won't take the
[1:30:38] Rapture on the way you feel the morning
[1:30:40] the Rapture takes place
[1:30:43] Church you may wake up on the mourn the
[1:30:45] Rapture and feel lower than a snake's
[1:30:47] belly you may wake up on the morning the
[1:30:49] Rapture and have a pound and headache
[1:30:51] and all kinds of troubles in your life
[1:30:53] all kinds of pressures against you amen
[1:30:55] and why you're standing in the mirror
[1:30:57] amen combing your hair and brushing your
[1:30:59] teeth and facing another day amen you
[1:31:02] could look in the mirror and see loved
[1:31:03] ones up here behind you
[1:31:08] those loved ones are not appearing based
[1:31:10] on the way you feel they are appearing
[1:31:13] based on the promise of God's word
[1:31:15] you will not feel the cold sweep amen
[1:31:18] based on the way you feel you will feel
[1:31:20] the cold sweep based on the word that
[1:31:23] said you would feel it it's God
[1:31:26] identified himself amen the word in the
[1:31:29] church
[1:31:30] the message is the word in the church
[1:31:35] uh it's the third pull it's the spoken
[1:31:39] word it's the revealing of the Mysteries
[1:31:43] it's the appearing of the Lord come on
[1:31:46] Amen somebody told me not long ago they
[1:31:48] said brother we got to be careful about
[1:31:49] this Revelation 10 1. I said you do but
[1:31:51] I don't
[1:31:53] they said no we got to be careful
[1:31:54] brother Andrew I said why they said
[1:31:56] because we haven't scientifically proven
[1:31:58] it yet I said what do you mean
[1:32:00] scientifically proven they said well
[1:32:01] we've got a God that's a college
[1:32:03] professor and he's working on proving
[1:32:05] this proving the cloud by science he
[1:32:07] said because you know when you introduce
[1:32:09] it to somebody that's scientific what
[1:32:11] would you tell them if you introduce the
[1:32:12] clown to him I said well here's what I'd
[1:32:14] say I'd say what a prophet said that's
[1:32:16] our Lord up there
[1:32:20] he said no no no what would you say I
[1:32:22] said well I'd say well the prophet said
[1:32:23] that's our Lord up there he said no no
[1:32:25] no you got to have something good enough
[1:32:26] to tell somebody I said if a prophet's
[1:32:29] words is not good enough to introduce
[1:32:31] this message by then there's nothing
[1:32:33] better coming amen but I believe the
[1:32:35] same Lord that filled Jeremiah's mouth
[1:32:38] with the words to tear down and to root
[1:32:40] up and to build out it's the same Lord
[1:32:42] Jesus that filled the words of William
[1:32:44] Branham and if he said the word you can
[1:32:47] take it to the bank it's going to happen
[1:32:49] because it's the word
[1:32:51] and I'll say it that's our Lord up there
[1:32:54] now now that's God coming down to the
[1:32:56] church identifying himself by the word
[1:32:58] in the church now you realize that we're
[1:33:00] living in a time of laodicea right we're
[1:33:02] living in Laos in time all kinds of
[1:33:04] people's rights all kinds of captivity
[1:33:06] all kinds of confusion and brother Brown
[1:33:08] comes in 1961 and preaches Daniel 70
[1:33:11] weeks preachers in three parts first
[1:33:14] part he says is Gabriel's instructions
[1:33:16] to Daniel he said then it's the six-fold
[1:33:18] purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel he
[1:33:20] said but then it's the 70th week of
[1:33:22] Daniel he said that's what ends at all
[1:33:24] is on that 70th week he said now what
[1:33:27] we're doing is we're speaking on Daniel
[1:33:29] in captivity
[1:33:31] Daniel in captivity and Gabriel flying
[1:33:35] in to instruct him about the future
[1:33:39] he's in captivity and God sends the
[1:33:42] angel Gabriel into captivity to instruct
[1:33:45] him about the future while Daniel was in
[1:33:47] prayer Gabriel the Angel come to
[1:33:49] instruct him now when brother Brown
[1:33:50] approaches if you study it closely
[1:33:52] you'll watch him he runs a parallel
[1:33:54] he'll run Daniel's day our day Daniel's
[1:33:57] day our day and he turns and says now I
[1:34:00] am Desiring to preach this amen not to
[1:34:02] give you a puffed up intellectualism but
[1:34:04] that you would receive amen the
[1:34:06] Revelation that would Enlighten the
[1:34:08] people about the future by the word now
[1:34:10] I love how Abraham said this he said my
[1:34:13] wife looked at me and said how do you
[1:34:14] expect our people which are poor people
[1:34:16] many of them uneducated like we are to
[1:34:19] understand such as that I said God will
[1:34:21] give the answer
[1:34:24] now I just got to go ahead and preach
[1:34:25] her for a second amen because I know
[1:34:27] that little fault that travels around
[1:34:28] that you can't preach this message to
[1:34:30] young people amen but I defy that line
[1:34:32] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:34:35] this message is Christ and if we can't
[1:34:38] preach this message to young people then
[1:34:40] you're telling me you can't preach
[1:34:41] Christ but I believe if our young people
[1:34:43] can build computers
[1:34:45] if they can build software programs I
[1:34:47] believe they can understand the word of
[1:34:49] the age they're living in and it can
[1:34:51] equip them to overcome every devil
[1:34:53] against them
[1:34:54] now he said no matter how complicated it
[1:34:57] is amen God can break it down and make
[1:35:00] it simple now what I love about this
[1:35:02] Brotherhood is brother says when Daniel
[1:35:04] goes into captivity he's about 12 or 14
[1:35:07] years old but the Bible said that Daniel
[1:35:09] purposed in his heart that he would not
[1:35:12] defile himself with the portion of the
[1:35:14] king's meat remember said Daniel was a
[1:35:16] prophet he said see the words of God the
[1:35:20] Bible was invested to Daniel
[1:35:24] to manifest to the people that God still
[1:35:27] lived
[1:35:29] the word the Bible the words of God was
[1:35:32] invested to Daniel
[1:35:34] to manifest to the people that God still
[1:35:38] lived
[1:35:39] and Daniel purposed in his heart that he
[1:35:42] would not defile his investment now
[1:35:44] watch this Daniel's day then parallels
[1:35:46] our day because Daniel was in a day of
[1:35:49] confusion Daniel was in Babylon right
[1:35:50] and Babylon means confusion and the
[1:35:53] father God said what could you give in
[1:35:54] exchange in this day of confusion this
[1:35:56] day when people don't know what to do
[1:35:57] which way to go the Bible said these
[1:36:00] days would come there would be a famine
[1:36:02] in the land not for bread or water but
[1:36:03] for the hearing the true word of God and
[1:36:05] the people would go from east to west
[1:36:06] north to south seeking to hear the true
[1:36:08] word and here we are privileged tonight
[1:36:11] to see the message of God the angel of
[1:36:15] God he said we're living in a day of
[1:36:16] confusion he said notice this the
[1:36:18] American and Canadian people he says are
[1:36:20] the worst confused people in all the
[1:36:22] world he said the worst confused of all
[1:36:25] world so can I say it to you like this
[1:36:26] in other words we're in the end time now
[1:36:28] I'm I'm tying this together okay we're
[1:36:30] in the end time and when God comes to an
[1:36:33] end he does not allow you to come that
[1:36:36] in without there being a warning
[1:36:39] in other words before you come to an end
[1:36:42] there's going to be a warning which is
[1:36:45] going to be a way to Mark the time
[1:36:47] you're living in now you can look to the
[1:36:49] Bible and see that lot he marked his
[1:36:51] time by Angels Abraham artist by the
[1:36:55] angel Lord Elohim you know how Rahab
[1:36:57] martirsched by Messengers but in the
[1:36:59] days of Daniel it says Daniel Martinez
[1:37:02] by books
[1:37:04] foreign
[1:37:05] come on church it was angels to Sodom it
[1:37:09] was the angel to Abraham Messengers to
[1:37:12] Rahab Revelation to Noah but to Daniel
[1:37:14] and Daniel 9 2 in the first year of his
[1:37:17] Reign I Daniel understood by what by
[1:37:20] books that the number of the years wrote
[1:37:22] the word the Lord came to Jeremiah the
[1:37:23] prophet he would accomplish 70 years in
[1:37:26] the desolation of Jerusalem look at this
[1:37:28] word understand it means to discern it
[1:37:31] means to consider it means to
[1:37:32] distinguish to have understanding and he
[1:37:34] says and I set my face unto the Lord God
[1:37:37] to seek by prayer and supplication with
[1:37:40] fasting in sackcoff and Ashes so in
[1:37:42] other words Daniel looked at the time
[1:37:44] and he discerned the time by the books
[1:37:48] that he was reading he looked at what
[1:37:50] was taking place and he discerned the
[1:37:52] time by the books in other words the
[1:37:55] books of a Vindicated Prophet Jeremiah
[1:37:57] amen so anointed Daniel that it moves
[1:38:00] him into desperation
[1:38:03] and he began to look at the conditions
[1:38:05] he began to look at the handwriting on
[1:38:07] the wall he began to Mark the things the
[1:38:10] prophet God said now watch he said he
[1:38:12] went into captivity in BC 606 when the
[1:38:15] vision came was BC 538 which leaves 68
[1:38:18] years he had been in Babylon amongst the
[1:38:21] heathens he said but he still had the
[1:38:23] victory
[1:38:24] 68 years in a heathen land without a
[1:38:28] church to go to without a song to sing
[1:38:30] come on young people without a youth
[1:38:32] camp every other month
[1:38:33] come on come on adults without a special
[1:38:36] meet never other week Daniel lived in
[1:38:39] captivity in 68 years of captivity
[1:38:44] oh he said but we can't stay an hour but
[1:38:47] he had the victory in the midst of there
[1:38:49] with no companions but three and they
[1:38:51] was in a different part of the Kingdom
[1:38:52] but Daniel's standing along with God
[1:38:55] held the victory for 68 years 68 years
[1:38:59] he kept the victory without the Holy
[1:39:01] Ghost without the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:39:03] just the blood of bulls and goats was
[1:39:05] the only thing Daniel had but he stayed
[1:39:08] in a place of Victory
[1:39:10] Daniel no church to go to no songs to
[1:39:13] sing No Fellowship I love what Barbara
[1:39:15] says he said but still he held on to
[1:39:18] what the prophet said
[1:39:20] now I'm gonna deliver my heart and I'm
[1:39:22] gonna go out of here are you hearing me
[1:39:24] he held on to what the prophet said
[1:39:26] evening Light Fellowship can I encourage
[1:39:28] you amen whatever you do Amen to hold on
[1:39:31] to what a prophet said
[1:39:33] I don't care what a website says I don't
[1:39:36] care what a Critic says I don't care
[1:39:37] what your favorite preacher says if it's
[1:39:39] contrary to what a prophet said you drop
[1:39:42] it like a hot potato and you get a hold
[1:39:44] of this Vindicated word it's the only
[1:39:46] thing that'll Lead You Out of Time into
[1:39:49] eternity it's the only thing that will
[1:39:50] change your body it's the only thing
[1:39:52] that will keep your mind it's the only
[1:39:54] thing that'll bring prodigals home
[1:39:56] it's the only thing that'll heal the
[1:39:58] sick it's the only thing that will raise
[1:40:00] the dead it's the only thing that'll
[1:40:02] bring loved ones out of an eternal
[1:40:04] Dimension into this Dimension is the
[1:40:06] message of the hour
[1:40:08] [Applause]
[1:40:12] oh brother Andrew be careful why should
[1:40:15] I be careful because before Daniel went
[1:40:17] into captivity there was a Prophet
[1:40:19] Jeremiah who was ordained to bring a
[1:40:21] message and Daniel was ordained to
[1:40:24] believe that message and he found that
[1:40:25] message I'm not going to read it to you
[1:40:27] but it's in Jeremiah 25 he found that
[1:40:30] message in books
[1:40:32] two
[1:40:34] in other words Daniel saw the reality of
[1:40:38] what he was in by reading Jeremiah's
[1:40:41] books
[1:40:42] oh the Lord thank you Jesus now watch
[1:40:45] this and those books moved him into
[1:40:47] desperation you know what he had he had
[1:40:50] a desperate cry you know what he was
[1:40:52] reading he was reading a Vindicated
[1:40:54] prophet and a Vindicated Prophet as a
[1:40:57] way to acknowledge the time you're
[1:40:59] living in amen from the scriptures and
[1:41:01] help you identify that time and Daniel
[1:41:04] took the word of Jeremiah and he goes
[1:41:06] down into Babylon because he was the
[1:41:09] anointed Prophet with the word now watch
[1:41:11] this Daniel goes before God and prays
[1:41:15] oh man this is powerful
[1:41:17] it goes but this time is preaching
[1:41:19] quicker than I can
[1:41:21] Daniel goes before God and asks him he
[1:41:24] says Lord will you just show me a little
[1:41:26] bit
[1:41:27] Abraham said Gabriel appeared to reveal
[1:41:29] not only what he was asking about but to
[1:41:32] tell him all the way down what was
[1:41:34] determined for the Jewish race all the
[1:41:37] way to the consummation
[1:41:39] in other words Daniel went to church on
[1:41:42] a Wednesday night
[1:41:44] and said Lord just give me enough to get
[1:41:46] to Sunday
[1:41:48] he said oh Lord just give me enough to
[1:41:51] get by just give me enough I love what
[1:41:53] program says brother Russell he said he
[1:41:55] asked a little bit and got the whole
[1:41:57] thing
[1:41:59] Daniel just asked God for a little bit
[1:42:02] and he ended up getting the whole thing
[1:42:04] old church the Living God don't you see
[1:42:06] who you are you are in the way of a true
[1:42:09] prophet and the way of a true Prophet
[1:42:11] Amen in this last day will proclaim the
[1:42:14] whole word come on church so I can stand
[1:42:17] here tonight and say you don't just have
[1:42:19] to live with a little bit you got the
[1:42:21] whole thing
[1:42:23] come on if you stay in the first pool
[1:42:26] you just got a little bit if you stay in
[1:42:28] the second pool you just got a little
[1:42:30] bit but if you come over in this third
[1:42:32] pool underneath the message of the hour
[1:42:34] you get the whole thing
[1:42:36] come on Church come on y'all some of
[1:42:38] y'all can fellowship with me on this
[1:42:39] thought when you got saved you was just
[1:42:42] looking for a freedom from sin you was
[1:42:44] just looking for a freedom from your
[1:42:45] past you was looking for freedom from
[1:42:47] the spirit of condemnation and the guilt
[1:42:49] that plagued your mind but when you got
[1:42:51] beneath this message
[1:42:56] when you got beneath this message you
[1:42:59] didn't just get forgiveness you didn't
[1:43:00] just get justification but you got the
[1:43:03] revelation of predestination you've got
[1:43:06] the revelation of serpent seed you got
[1:43:08] the revelation of the Seven Seals you
[1:43:10] got the revelation of the mystery of God
[1:43:12] you've got the Revelation the future
[1:43:14] home
[1:43:15] you know what Daniel did he come
[1:43:18] underneath the anointing of Jeremiah's
[1:43:21] message now I love this next part
[1:43:22] because when Jeremiah receives this
[1:43:24] message God tells Jeremiah don't you
[1:43:27] stay in one place with it he said you
[1:43:29] take it everywhere he said see Jeremiah
[1:43:32] took the word of the Lord which was the
[1:43:34] wine of his word and the wine is the
[1:43:36] power of His word he said what wine has
[1:43:39] a power it has an intoxication he said
[1:43:41] what is wine it is the stimulation
[1:43:46] of Revelation what is it it's
[1:43:49] stimulation by drinking the revelation
[1:43:52] of the word and as you drink it it's
[1:43:54] bringing a purpose and an understanding
[1:43:56] now Reverend said like this he said the
[1:43:58] spirit of wisdom comes in the church
[1:43:59] makes known to the church by the
[1:44:00] revelation of the Holy Ghost bring in
[1:44:02] the church in and revealing what they
[1:44:04] were living in just the same as Gabriel
[1:44:07] come to Daniel the Holy Ghost has come
[1:44:09] to the church in the last days
[1:44:11] to reveal these great deep deep secret
[1:44:14] things then watch what he says do you
[1:44:16] understand now
[1:44:20] can we turn the corner and go home
[1:44:22] do you understand now brother Andrew
[1:44:25] what do you mean do you understand now
[1:44:27] Abraham said in the last days we are
[1:44:29] given the understanding by the word that
[1:44:33] we are going to understand it because
[1:44:35] it'll come to an Ephesian age now watch
[1:44:38] this and we're here
[1:44:40] you know what the Bible says who so
[1:44:42] readth let him understand
[1:44:45] and in the last days under the third
[1:44:47] poll the understanding by the opening of
[1:44:50] the word would come into the church and
[1:44:52] listen we would not be asking for a
[1:44:54] little bit
[1:44:57] come on you're the you're the
[1:44:58] culmination
[1:44:59] you're the final age you're the final
[1:45:02] people in other words you're not lot
[1:45:04] marking the time by just Angels you're
[1:45:07] not Abraham just marking about the
[1:45:09] angels of the Lord Elohim you're not
[1:45:10] just Rahab marketed by Messengers you're
[1:45:13] not just knowing marking it by
[1:45:14] Revelation and you're not just Daniel
[1:45:17] marking it by books but you got the
[1:45:19] angels
[1:45:21] you got for Messengers you got the
[1:45:23] Revelation you got the books come on you
[1:45:27] are a people who has been equipped to
[1:45:29] overcome this age by the message he was
[1:45:31] ordained to believe and brother M turns
[1:45:34] and says now if there ever was a time
[1:45:36] that we ought to be setting ourselves in

[1:47:21] things will take place can I say it to
[1:47:22] you like this and I'm done I understand
[1:47:24] by the books that people can live so
[1:47:27] close to God till the devil don't know
[1:47:29] what to do with them

[1:47:36] invincible Army I understand by books
[1:47:38] amen that missing limbs will be restored
[1:47:41] I understand amen by books that some
[1:47:43] morning between six and nine you'll be
[1:47:46] standing in a mirror and combing your
[1:47:48] hair and your body will be changed
[1:47:50] can I leave your fist if there is a
[1:47:53] spirit on you that is ashamed of this
[1:47:55] message and ashamed of these books I
[1:47:57] rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus
[1:48:00] Christ
[1:48:01] you say brother Andrew what do you mean
[1:48:03] what do you mean by these books I
[1:48:05] understand my things that are to be I've
[1:48:07] got a theophany
[1:48:09] I understand by The Rapture that
[1:48:11] there'll be a shout a voice and a
[1:48:13] trumpet I understand come on church I
[1:48:16] understand by the future home that
[1:48:18] there's a marriage supper of the lamb
[1:48:19] and I'm going to sit there I understand
[1:48:21] by books that my name was on the Lamb's
[1:48:24] Book of Life and it was put there before
[1:48:26] the foundation of the world
[1:48:30] I understand my books I understand see
[1:48:33] what's happened the church has come
[1:48:35] under a prophetic utterance and by
[1:48:37] coming under this prophetic utterance
[1:48:38] it's the fourth light which is the
[1:48:40] message of life which is ordained you to
[1:48:43] understand I understand by books you're
[1:48:45] the final voice
[1:48:47] laughs ordained
[1:48:50] to prophesy again
[1:48:52] now brother Andrew you're laying this on
[1:48:55] us pretty heavy well I pray the spirit
[1:48:56] Lord will break it down for you
[1:48:58] because I know these are all things
[1:49:00] you've been taught for years
[1:49:02] I understand that this message is not an
[1:49:05] opinion
[1:49:09] I understand it's an absolute
[1:49:15] what are you saying I'm saying a gift of
[1:49:17] Prophecy is judged by two or three
[1:49:19] people right
[1:49:20] but a prophet is not judged
[1:49:22] because it's the absolute truth I
[1:49:26] understand by books that the message is
[1:49:27] the absolute judge and it's not subject
[1:49:30] to your question or your opinions
[1:49:32] I understand by books to say what a
[1:49:34] Vindicated Prophet says will make you a
[1:49:37] Prophet of Truth and anything else out
[1:49:39] of that must be judged I understand that
[1:49:41] if you say what a prophet said it'll
[1:49:43] give you a perfect Faith to keep on
[1:49:45] saying it
[1:49:46] I understand by books that if you'll get
[1:49:49] underneath this third pull anointing
[1:49:51] it'll go from an anointing to a super
[1:49:53] anointing
[1:49:56] I've got to quit it's Wednesday night I
[1:49:58] understand if you get under these books
[1:50:00] it'll anoint you to say what a prophet's
[1:50:02] saying come on have you ever taken time
[1:50:05] to read Look Away to Jesus and read the
[1:50:07] dialogue The Prophet rehearses between

[1:50:16] said and then I said and then she said
[1:50:18] and when I say it then little Hattie

[1:50:49] desire the greatest thing her boys were
[1:50:51] even snickering and laughing and she
[1:50:53] said the greatest desire I have is the
[1:50:56] Salvation of my two sons then I say it

[2:06:03] hey Hallelujah there's anointing up here
[2:06:08] don't I I love him
[2:06:11] I get so excited
[2:06:14] 18 years of age over there in California
[2:06:19] long-haired Surfer
[2:06:22] didn't know nothing
[2:06:23] [Music]
[2:06:26] never went to church with my parents my
[2:06:30] parents weren't church people
[2:06:32] oh yet when I heard this message
[2:06:39] nobody speak like that man
[2:06:41] [Music]
[2:06:45] only been in the message a couple weeks
[2:06:49] we found this tape called choosing a
[2:06:51] bride
[2:06:52] or just a bunch of young men and thought
[2:06:55] well we huh Emmanuel we we need to know
[2:06:58] how to choose a bride yeah yeah and we
[2:07:01] was laughing you bear yeah he says you
[2:07:04] better look that old heifer in the eye
[2:07:07] he said she got that wild stairs she'll
[2:07:09] never you know we are laughing and
[2:07:11] everything
[2:07:12] only a couple weeks in this message then
[2:07:15] we heard oh caperna mocha
[2:07:18] a city which cooleth itself the City of
[2:07:21] Angels

[2:07:39] nearly everybody in that group that
[2:07:42] night that heard that tape
[2:07:44] got out of California and I believe that
[2:07:48] God is still
[2:07:49] calling people
[2:07:51] because the message is not to stay in a
[2:07:53] book
[2:07:55] it's not to stay on a tape
[2:07:57] it doesn't replace Church it doesn't
[2:08:00] replace the fivefold ministry
[2:08:03] huh

[2:10:02] for it is the word father and that word
[2:10:04] being revealed to us that father gives a
[2:10:09] word Revival
[2:10:11] not a something that's worked up no it's
[2:10:15] something that becomes intoxicated
[2:10:18] because when you drink something that is
[2:10:22] stimulating
[2:10:24] oh it stimulates you
[2:10:27] I don't care if
[2:10:29] the flashes and feeling it the flesh
[2:10:32] don't have to feel it God is weaning his

[2:11:03] that word
[2:11:04] I love it Lord when I see young men
[2:11:06] feeding on the word and when they feed
[2:11:09] on the word they become the word
[2:11:11] I thank you Father that that's what
[2:11:13] Daniel did he purposed within himself he
[2:11:17] began to read the words of Jeremiah
[2:11:19] because Jeremiah Was
[2:11:21] father he was ordained to
[2:11:24] preach a word that later someone would
