[10:07] had in our old church at Maryland and
[10:10] always has a good spirit about him and
[10:13] appreciate him praying this morning. Our
[10:15] praise reports, let's start with them
[10:17] today. Brother Ezra Page says, "I would
[10:19] like to thank the Lord for touching my
[10:21] lower back. It went out on Wednesday
[10:23] morning. By his grace, I'm doing much
[10:25] better." So, we thank the Lord for that.
[10:27] Amen. A praise report this morning from
[10:29] Sister Anita Hogwin. Uh dear brothers
[10:32] and sisters, the ladies at work that
[10:34] requested prayer want to thank the Lord.
[10:36] Uh one uh she is regaining movement in
[10:39] her hips and her knees and so that she
[10:41] may be able to dress herself. The other
[10:44] one uh only a minor setback but she has
[10:48] regained some strength and some uh her
[10:50] wellness and our Lord is here for all
[10:52] those things. Thank you in Jesus name.
[10:54] So we thank the Lord for that. Uh the
[10:57] sister Charmin Smith says, "Thank you
[10:58] for praying for the Rules family. Their
[11:01] baby Matthew was released from the
[11:03] hospital on Friday and he's making a
[11:05] full recovery." So we thank the Lord for
[11:07] that one as well. Uh Brother Ruben
[11:10] Tamlinson says, "I want to thank the
[11:11] Lord for touching my back. I went up for
[11:13] prayer when brother Lindsey McGrady

[11:18] from a very tight muscle and it was
[11:20] completely gone the next day. And to God
[11:22] be the glory." So we thank the Lord for
[11:24] that this morning.
[11:26] We thank the Lord for our praise reports
[11:28] this morning.
[11:30] He's a good God.
[11:33] He hears and he answers prayer. He says,
[11:37] "Knock and it shall be open unto you.
[11:39] Seek and you shall find what your need
[11:42] today. Just give it to Jesus." Our
[11:44] prayer request this morning, Sister
[11:46] Suzanne Peterson says, "My mom's surgery

[11:55] Julie, and she isn't a believer, but she
[11:58] has a big surgery. She had a big surgery
[12:01] a while back, and the pain wouldn't go
[12:02] away. After multiple attempts to find a
[12:05] solution, they just discovered a medical
[12:08] error was done, and a nerve was
[12:11] damaged. May through this trial she come
[12:14] to know that the Lord is her friend and

[31:49] God bless you all. We greet you in the
[31:50] lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus

[31:59] open your eyes, give you the Isab to be
[32:01] able to see the prophecy of what's going
[32:03] on in this hour. Not only to see it, but
[32:06] to be a part of it.
[32:08] Because the Bible says that the
[32:10] testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit
[32:13] of prophecy. Amen. So therefore, if

[35:17] And
[35:18] uh we're just so very very
[35:21] pleased to go ahead and dedicate this
[35:24] baby. Let me read the scripture here.
[35:27] Mark 10 verse 13. And they brought young
[35:32] children to him that he should touch
[35:35] them. And his disciples rebuked them
[35:37] that brought
[35:39] them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much
[35:42] displeased and said unto them, "Suffer
[35:44] the little children to come unto me, and
[35:46] forbid them not, for of such is the
[35:50] kingdom of God.
[35:52] Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall
[35:54] not receive the kingdom of God as a
[35:56] little child, he shall not enter
[35:59] therein. And he took them up in his
[36:01] arms, put his hands upon them, and
[36:05] blessed
[36:06] them. Amen. Go ahead and come up a
[36:09] little closer
[36:11] here. Come on.
[36:15] It's not this one. No, it's this one.
[36:20] This one is turn. Yeah, I know. He's
[36:22] dead.
[36:27] Excuse what?
[36:32] Amen. Look at this little suit he's got
[36:34] on.
[36:36] Huh? Oh,
[36:39] yeah. You have very beautiful little
[36:42] babies. God has blessed you
[36:45] richly. Amen.
[36:48] They have chose to
[36:51] name
[36:53] Ele and
[36:55] Joshua. Leel is a combination of
[36:59] Eli and
[37:01] L.
[37:04] Eli means my God is
[37:07] God. And Eli and L together is my God is
[37:12] the true God. Amen. Huh?
[37:16] L E L Joshua and Joshua means Jehovah
[37:20] Savior,
[37:22] strong,
[37:23] names of character.
[37:26] That in this hour
[37:28] when all hell has been the lid of hell
[37:32] has been broken
[37:35] off and there is darkness everywhere but
[37:38] God has sent us light.
[37:41] [Music]
[37:43] And this little boy,
[37:46] Elel, may he be
[37:48] one that is a part of this end time
[37:51] move,
[37:52] a part of the move of God in this
[37:55] hour. Let us just bow our heads now if

[38:20] life. I pray that you will give him
[38:23] health and happiness. I pray heavenly
[38:26] father that

[38:53] quickening power that he would walk in
[38:56] your statutes and in your ways. I bless

[39:05] service. Watch over and keep him now,

[51:08] We also thank brother Ron
[51:14] because today he has allowed us to be
[51:17] behind his pulpit.
[51:20] It's not given to anyone.
[51:25] Therefore, I thank him.
[51:29] And I thank you also for being
[51:33] here. And I think that God will assist
[51:36] us today
[51:38] and somebody will be blessed.
[51:43] Greet all God's servants here
[51:46] present. I see brother Nathan and his
[51:53] wife. Let's stand to start the service.
[52:04] Uh we'll take our Bibles and uh
[52:11] our God is a God of variety.
[52:14] [Music]
[52:18] We won't preach the same way like
[52:20] brother Ron
[52:24] because since he's a god of
[52:29] variety we'll preach as he has also
[52:32] given us the another variety. Amen.
[52:38] Let's begin with the book of
[52:41] Mark chapter 11.
[52:49] Reading from uh verse 22 to 3 23.
[52:53] Reading in the name of our Lord Jesus.
[53:03] Mark chapter
[53:13] 11. And Jesus answering said unto them,
[53:16] "Have faith in God.
[53:37] For verily I say unto you, that
[53:40] whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
[53:42] be thou removed, and be thou cast into
[53:45] the sea, and shall not doubt in his
[53:48] heart, but shall believe that those
[53:50] things which he have said shall come to
[53:52] pass. It shall have whatsoever he saith.
[53:55] Amen.
[54:01] and we'll I'll finish with first
[54:04] Thessalonians chapter 5 verse
[54:25] 23. Amen. And the very God of peace
[54:29] sanctify you holy. And I pray God are
[54:32] your God your whole spirit and soul and
[54:36] body be preserved blameless unto the
[54:38] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[54:44] May say let's say a word of prayer for
[54:47] the while we praying.
[54:51] Lord Jesus Christ,
[54:55] are we calling you on the scene?
[55:00] Our words can kill,
[55:04] but yours giveth
[55:08] life. Therefore, we need your spirit to
[55:10] take hold of
[55:13] us. May your spirit speak to your
[55:17] people and remove us from the pullpit.
[55:22] But you alone may speak.
[55:25] We ask Lord
[55:27] Jesus from the beginning to the end.
[55:31] Let your word deliver.
[55:34] May your word
[55:38] heal. May your word take control of
[55:41] everything.
[55:45] Casting out all evil spirit from here
[55:49] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[55:52] Anoint the
[55:55] interpreter. Start with us from
[55:56] beginning to the
[55:58] end. As we pray with
[56:01] faith, not for our own
[56:04] glory, but
[56:07] yours in the name that knows no
[56:10] failure. Because Baron said that deity
[56:13] is no more in heaven.
[56:16] Deity is on
[56:18] earth. When deity is on
[56:21] earth, it's not on the trees,
[56:27] but deity is in the believers who are
[56:33] film said that the man filled with the
[56:36] Holy
[56:36] Ghost is a mystical
[56:39] person. What does it mean to be
[56:41] mystical?
[56:43] When we say
[56:45] mystical that ties
[56:48] to not only to the
[56:51] spirit but also ties to
[56:55] deity and errors that we have
[56:58] made. We only took that
[57:01] day. We have believed what the word told
[57:05] us that all that was in
[57:07] God and that God pour it
[57:10] in and all that was in
[57:13] Bible and God had poured it in the
[57:16] Bible. But at times we make
[57:19] the
[57:21] weet and we leave it in the
[57:25] prophet and we close it over there and
[57:29] they even take it. We put in the pocket
[57:32] and they live with it.
[57:35] No, there this morning I
[57:38] come and I tell them to bring back the
[57:41] king because
[57:44] they when he was in the
[57:47] prophet. It means that us
[57:49] also we are
[57:52] able to do the
[57:54] very but we our
[57:58] own because if Jesus Christ was the
[58:00] great a
[58:04] If
[58:06] brother and if I am a driver,
[58:11] but the formula has to remain the same.
[58:14] Amen. Can somebody say amen? Amen. Can
[58:17] somebody say
[58:19] amen? There are things that when we look
[58:21] at them,
[58:24] we wondering how did it
[58:27] happen. We said that we also
[58:31] How come can we not fulfill the same
[58:33] thing? Let me tell
[58:36] you all are possible to whom that
[58:40] believe that are possible to whom that
[58:44] believe. Even this
[58:48] morning to say that all is possible to
[58:50] whom that believe.
[58:52] We read in the
[58:54] Bible, we see Philillip in the
[58:57] Bible with the
[59:08] inoc. The Bible says that the Holy Ghost
[59:10] took him from from where he was to
[59:14] somewhere
[59:16] else. Let me ask you the same question
[59:19] this morning.
[59:21] If I had to do it for
[59:24] you, will you call me or you label me
[59:26] anything?
[59:29] But since it's the Bible that
[59:32] say we say amen because it's
[59:36] Philip but we are
[59:38] not to do the same
[59:41] thing. Let me say to tell
[59:44] someone that this morning I
[59:48] came to say to bring
[59:52] something because from a
[59:56] concentration that the mystical will now
[59:58] take
[1:00:00] over is from a
[1:00:03] concentration that the faith that was
[1:00:06] that will be
[1:00:08] activated. And when this faith
[1:00:11] is you can now fulfill
[1:00:15] greater and the people who went deep
[1:00:18] into there are
[1:00:20] miracles they do
[1:00:24] miracles to the degree that people
[1:00:27] cannot understand how come they do
[1:00:29] it. Therefore to
[1:00:32] understand we have to go
[1:00:36] back to understand first what is the
[1:00:38] spiritual
[1:00:41] concentration and to understand the
[1:00:43] spiritual
[1:00:46] concentration and we have to be based on
[1:00:49] the first scripture that we just
[1:00:52] read. The human being is made out of
[1:00:55] three
[1:00:56] parts. We have the body. We have the
[1:01:00] spirit and we also have the
[1:01:03] soul. And when we look at from the
[1:01:08] body and we know that our body is made
[1:01:11] out of five senses all of
[1:01:15] us and the five senses are given to us
[1:01:18] to get into contact with terrestrial
[1:01:23] body. We have decide to look from it. We
[1:01:27] have ear to hear from it.
[1:01:29] We have the
[1:01:31] meditation and we have the touch to
[1:01:33] touch with
[1:01:34] it. But when we leave from this
[1:01:38] level, I need also already that you
[1:01:45] understand that these five senses were
[1:01:48] not given to us to get in touch with
[1:01:50] God.
[1:01:52] We see that many
[1:01:56] Christians they try to concentrate
[1:01:59] themselves from the five senses.
[1:02:03] When you when you concentrate only from
[1:02:06] the
[1:02:06] [Applause]
[1:02:08] five that will only be physical
[1:02:12] exercise that won't amount to
[1:02:17] anything. But then when we get to the
[1:02:20] spiritual part of
[1:02:22] it that you'll see now that the senses
[1:02:25] differ in the spirit because the spirit
[1:02:28] also has five
[1:02:30] senses. Now the sp five senses in the
[1:02:34] spirit they are different types of
[1:02:37] senses. Let me read the prophet first.
[1:02:41] With these
[1:02:43] senses we'll get in the spirit so you
[1:02:46] can situate yourself.
[1:02:49] You'll understand
[1:02:51] that the symphony will try to change
[1:02:54] when we get into the
[1:02:58] spirit. Uh let's take Revelation chapter
[1:03:01] 4 part 3
[1:03:04] uh January
[1:03:07] 861 paragraph 221 in English the prophet
[1:03:12] says
[1:03:15] this says that the soul the attributes
[1:03:18] of the senses are
[1:03:21] [Music]
[1:03:22] imaginations
[1:03:25] conscience
[1:03:27] memory
[1:03:28] ing
[1:03:30] reason and
[1:03:35] affection is the senses or the
[1:03:37] attributes.
[1:03:41] Listen, the soul is the nature of the
[1:03:45] spirit that's on the inside.
[1:03:53] Cause the soul only puts out an
[1:03:55] atmosphere of what's in the inside of
[1:03:57] you.
[1:04:01] It takes place of the sanctification.
[1:04:05] It's on the same category there.
[1:04:08] All right.
[1:04:12] Now, everybody got all that down.
[1:04:17] You understand that the spirit
[1:04:20] has
[1:04:23] senses that are a little bit
[1:04:26] different, when we speak of the
[1:04:29] will, when we speak about
[1:04:32] feelings, when we when we speak of
[1:04:35] reason and
[1:04:38] But then my point here
[1:04:40] is it's not with all those senses
[1:04:46] but because I'm talking on the spiritual
[1:04:49] concentration there are
[1:04:52] elements who are in the
[1:04:55] spirit able to help you
[1:05:00] to help you concentrate. Amen.
[1:05:03] Let me take a a part of it.
[1:05:06] A sense of the spirit.
[1:05:09] Let me take conscience.
[1:05:12] When we take conscience
[1:05:14] in the conscience,
[1:05:17] they are a part of
[1:05:20] subconscious. The subconscious is also
[1:05:23] in the
[1:05:24] conscience. You'll see find
[1:05:28] with the
[1:05:29] subconscious. You can fulfill anything.
[1:05:32] You can do anything.
[1:05:36] But it's to be
[1:05:38] initiated. When I speak about
[1:05:43] initiation, I'm speaking of of the Holy
[1:05:45] Ghost who's the
[1:05:47] great, I'm not talking about a
[1:05:51] mercenary. But I'd like you to
[1:05:53] understand one
[1:05:55] thing. Because everything that is taking
[1:05:57] place with
[1:05:58] magic, it's the
[1:06:01] devil since impersonating He's
[1:06:05] impersonating those things and he is
[1:06:08] doing it
[1:06:11] because I want you to understand that
[1:06:13] the genuine it's us
[1:06:16] the genuine it's us. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:06:20] Amen.
[1:06:22] Because when we go
[1:06:24] into there's also the
[1:06:27] thought and the
[1:06:30] thought is also able of everything.
[1:06:35] Because I like you to understand this
[1:06:39] morning because the thought works with
[1:06:42] the spirit.
[1:06:45] Because as I'm talking this
[1:06:47] morning if your thought is at
[1:06:52] work, even your spirit will also be at
[1:06:56] work. If your thought your mind is here
[1:07:00] meaning
[1:07:01] that even your spirit is here
[1:07:05] present. Therefore I like your your mind
[1:07:08] to be
[1:07:09] here. If your mind is
[1:07:12] here therefore the word will do
[1:07:17] something. Now when we speak about
[1:07:20] concentration you need to
[1:07:23] understand it doesn't go with the fresh.
[1:07:29] And this concentration only goes with
[1:07:31] the
[1:07:33] spirit. I told you that you cannot
[1:07:36] concentrate in the
[1:07:37] flesh because by focusing on the
[1:07:40] flesh, you'll only be a physical
[1:07:45] exercise. But concentration is a domain
[1:07:48] of completely
[1:07:49] spiritual. Listen carefully.
[1:07:53] When we speak about concentration,
[1:07:56] It's the the fact of gathering
[1:07:58] everything in one
[1:08:00] place meaning from the
[1:08:02] spirit you can bring everything
[1:08:05] together and do greater
[1:08:08] things because the
[1:08:10] soul has only one
[1:08:12] sense and if you have
[1:08:14] doubt therefore you that's
[1:08:17] unbelief and if you're a
[1:08:19] believer and inside of you there's
[1:08:22] faith listen carefully
[1:08:26] To get to the
[1:08:27] soul, you have to go through by the
[1:08:31] spirit for the spirit to give
[1:08:36] wayapacity. You must have the ability to
[1:08:38] focus or to
[1:08:40] concentrate. Therefore, then the result
[1:08:43] cannot
[1:08:44] happen. If you are unable to
[1:08:47] focus, you will not be able to get to
[1:08:49] the soul. Amen. Can somebody say amen?
[1:08:52] Amen. Can somebody say
[1:08:55] amen? I'd like us to read something that
[1:08:58] the prophet is
[1:09:03] speaking in in line of what God has from
[1:09:06] the foundation of the world has put in
[1:09:08] the man. Their
[1:09:10] ability their
[1:09:12] ability that God has put in a
[1:09:15] man even if he's a
[1:09:18] pagan is able to fulfill greater things.
[1:09:24] because God has placed that thing in
[1:09:26] him. Let's read the
[1:09:29] prophet. That's what now will give me
[1:09:31] the
[1:09:32] way. You'll understand that
[1:09:35] the according to what we have read with
[1:09:37] the prophet makes of you what you
[1:09:41] are. If in your soul they are seeing
[1:09:43] you, you are seeing yourself.
[1:09:47] That's why the Bible
[1:09:50] say Jesus Christ who didn't know
[1:09:53] sin but it became sin he became
[1:09:57] sin not he didn't become sinner
[1:10:02] why because the state of his
[1:10:05] soul his soul that was
[1:10:08] pure was defiled by our
[1:10:12] sin he became sin
[1:10:15] Id like to tell you
[1:10:17] something. All of you have noticed. You
[1:10:20] have a
[1:10:21] baby who just who's just
[1:10:25] born. And when you take this baby even
[1:10:29] to washing, you take
[1:10:33] him. You try to leave him
[1:10:36] alone. You see that the baby is afraid.
[1:10:40] You ask
[1:10:41] yourself, this baby is just born.
[1:10:45] I didn't know that fear
[1:10:48] exist. This is the answer
[1:10:50] to the answer
[1:10:53] is in his soul there's
[1:10:56] emptiness. Since in the soul there's
[1:10:59] emptiness. Now fear takes
[1:11:02] over. That's why the baby who's just
[1:11:07] born has a fear in it because in his
[1:11:10] soul there's
[1:11:11] emptiness. Amen. Can you can somebody
[1:11:14] say amen? Let's let's go on. Let's take
[1:11:17] the prophet
[1:11:20] because it's from
[1:11:21] here they will be able to take
[1:11:26] off. The prophet Brandham
[1:11:29] says the sermon the
[1:11:34] Messiah. the Messiah.
[1:11:40] January 17
[1:11:43] 61 paragraph
[1:11:46] 92. Brotherham says this
[1:11:50] here the other other
[1:11:54] night. I saw on the on a
[1:11:59] telecast a man a man with a seic mental
[1:12:03] faith.
[1:12:05] And I set a glass of
[1:12:08] water and I stood
[1:12:11] back
[1:12:13] and concentrating on that
[1:12:16] glass of water till it burst. It bursted
[1:12:20] out. I believe everybody have seen it.
[1:12:23] somebody who takes the the glass and
[1:12:26] puts on the the table and he look he
[1:12:30] steps back and look he concentrate and
[1:12:34] the the
[1:12:35] glass and somebody can even look at the
[1:12:38] light and it looks concentrate on the
[1:12:41] light and
[1:12:44] it when we look at we call it magic
[1:12:49] but then let's go with the
[1:12:51] prophet the prophet says
[1:12:56] And it was just by kept
[1:12:59] concentrating watching the glass of
[1:13:01] water and the glass cracked and the
[1:13:05] water ran
[1:13:08] out just pure mental
[1:13:12] concentration as the questions
[1:13:16] why dust is
[1:13:19] fibers that's the man's nature
[1:13:23] oritution. That's his makeup.
[1:13:28] If he can do that,
[1:13:31] got a power in
[1:13:34] him by mental
[1:13:37] thinking that can break a glass of
[1:13:40] water. And him being a
[1:13:46] sinner, that shows that there was
[1:13:49] something made in that man.
[1:13:54] is in a fallen
[1:13:57] perverted
[1:13:59] condition. But if that man can only get
[1:14:02] back to
[1:14:04] God and let God get into
[1:14:08] him, why with that
[1:14:11] power of that turn loose on the kingdom
[1:14:14] of God, he didn't have no
[1:14:17] conductor. He was like a gunshot.
[1:14:21] He was just as splattered
[1:14:23] everywhere. But if that spirit that's in
[1:14:26] a man
[1:14:29] could be
[1:14:31] converted and put Christ in
[1:14:35] there where he's got a
[1:14:39] conductor. A conductor is a
[1:14:41] wire that conducts it. Amen. Says
[1:14:47] amen. And then let a man with that same
[1:14:50] faith in the conductor of the word of
[1:14:53] God. Now
[1:14:57] listen, he says that he can raise the
[1:15:01] dead cleans the
[1:15:04] lepers, cast out
[1:15:06] devils. Brother says,
[1:15:09] "Amen." And listen to this.
[1:15:13] Listen. Is fashion like a god.
[1:15:17] He looks like God. Show. Show what?
[1:15:22] That's the reason.
[1:15:26] Listen. Reason God was
[1:15:29] God. Man was
[1:15:32] God. And this is his offspring
[1:15:37] offspring. Man, he's only trying to get
[1:15:41] a hold of a
[1:15:43] man. Trying to get a man in his hand.
[1:15:46] Amen. Can somebody say amen? It is very
[1:15:50] strong. It's not easy when we read it.
[1:15:54] Amen. We say amen.
[1:15:56] But then to fulfill
[1:15:58] it and that's where the issue now to
[1:16:02] fulfill
[1:16:03] it and we have to use the
[1:16:05] spirit. We have to get into
[1:16:09] this. That's where you understand the
[1:16:12] prophet says the truth
[1:16:14] in the Bible.
[1:16:16] You've
[1:16:17] seen there are people who have had
[1:16:20] issues and these issues have take
[1:16:22] longer. They could have prayed
[1:16:25] prayed but there was no solution to
[1:16:28] it but the day that they took the
[1:16:31] decision to
[1:16:34] concentrate and the solution came right
[1:16:36] away. I'll give you an example. Look at
[1:16:41] Anna Samuel's mother.
[1:16:45] She didn't give birth,
[1:16:51] but the other lady had
[1:16:53] children. But you'll
[1:16:55] notice despite of her
[1:16:58] pray, solution didn't come about. But
[1:17:02] one
[1:17:04] day, it was a different day than every
[1:17:06] other
[1:17:09] day. Anna took a prayer of
[1:17:11] concentration.
[1:17:15] Anna went to and stayed at
[1:17:17] church inside of
[1:17:20] Anna. There was all the insult from
[1:17:25] her. There was all kind
[1:17:27] of
[1:17:29] Anna, there was all
[1:17:32] cry. She gathered all those
[1:17:35] things and she presented before
[1:17:39] God. She could not leave a spirit in her
[1:17:44] in the field of concentration. Don't
[1:17:47] leave your spirit
[1:17:48] empty. When you leave an empty spirit,
[1:17:52] the devil would take over.
[1:17:54] And when Anna
[1:17:57] prayed and she prayed in a
[1:18:00] session, even
[1:18:02] Eli is
[1:18:05] not every day Anna prayed.
[1:18:08] And for this time she has a different
[1:18:12] and she went to see Anna.
[1:18:15] Anna, you never prayed like
[1:18:17] this to have this
[1:18:19] strength to pray like this. You must be
[1:18:24] drunk. I say one of you to get into the
[1:18:28] concentration you must be drunk. But the
[1:18:32] drunkenness that I'm talking about is
[1:18:34] not
[1:18:35] of strong dreams, but the of the Holy
[1:18:39] Spirit. When you get into that
[1:18:43] state, you see the solution right away.
[1:18:48] Yes, it is the
[1:18:51] truth. Elias asked the
[1:18:54] question, "You you you've taken strong
[1:18:56] drinks."
[1:18:58] He said, she said, "No, it's not strong
[1:19:00] drinks. But is this the pain is all the
[1:19:05] worry and the solution was
[1:19:08] given because she gathered all things in
[1:19:11] one place. And when she was praying, it
[1:19:14] was no more
[1:19:17] an spirit inside of
[1:19:22] Anna and she was connected to the
[1:19:26] server and therefore God had only to
[1:19:29] answer. Yes my brother
[1:19:35] concentration is a part of the element
[1:19:37] that you need in your
[1:19:39] life because with this the ground shows
[1:19:42] you able to fulfill greater things in
[1:19:45] the Christian life. I'll give you
[1:19:47] another example with what happened back
[1:19:50] home. There was a
[1:19:52] brother every time
[1:19:55] when did he has to call the
[1:19:59] deacon he has to call the pastor for
[1:20:01] prayer and one
[1:20:04] day in the middle of the
[1:20:09] night you know it's not
[1:20:13] like it's not like you know as it is
[1:20:15] here here you call the ambulance right
[1:20:17] away but then
[1:20:19] with allow
[1:20:22] I've
[1:20:26] noted. How come that when there's an
[1:20:28] issue, we have to think first of the
[1:20:30] ambulance?
[1:20:32] A true Christian. When there's an issue
[1:20:36] first and the ambulance comes after
[1:20:42] listen you pulling me into something but
[1:20:45] I'm going to let me tell you something
[1:20:47] here and this brother when the son is
[1:20:52] sick right
[1:20:54] away my child is
[1:20:57] suffering oh the
[1:21:01] deacon and now this time now he was
[1:21:03] around
[1:21:05] midnight and the child was losing
[1:21:09] conscious and the brother took the phone
[1:21:12] as usual. He calls the
[1:21:14] deacon and the the deacon's phone was
[1:21:19] off. What kind of deacon is this? He's
[1:21:21] turning off the phone at midnight and
[1:21:23] they tried to call now the pastor. He
[1:21:26] calls the
[1:21:27] pastor. The pastor's phone was off.
[1:21:31] while he was calling the the
[1:21:34] pastor and right away the wife also
[1:21:36] passes
[1:21:38] out and now the man alone in the
[1:21:41] house and he find himself with two
[1:21:44] people now passing out on the
[1:21:48] ground and he didn't have any means to
[1:21:50] do
[1:21:51] anything now listen to what the brother
[1:21:53] did he took he test one
[1:21:56] child it test the child test the wipe
[1:22:01] their legs. He start praying.
[1:22:04] Oh eternal God of William Brham.
[1:22:07] Listen my God.
[1:22:10] And this has happened just in another
[1:22:13] day. I called the
[1:22:14] deacon. His phone is
[1:22:17] off. I even called the pastor. His phone
[1:22:21] is
[1:22:22] off. But I know that your
[1:22:26] phone is never off. I call I'm asking
[1:22:31] you before he finish his
[1:22:34] prayer this child that was stood up
[1:22:39] before the prayer
[1:22:40] ended the child the wife that was laying
[1:22:43] was standing
[1:22:45] up and the brother understood that even
[1:22:49] himself he had the
[1:22:51] ability to talk to
[1:22:54] God and God was giving
[1:22:56] answers. Let me test one of you by by
[1:23:01] times we always limit our abilities to
[1:23:05] do things because this
[1:23:08] brother he went into a domain that he
[1:23:13] has never been into since his birth
[1:23:16] since he has
[1:23:18] believed. It's only that day that he
[1:23:20] went into
[1:23:22] concentration because at that
[1:23:25] time it was no more the flesh
[1:23:28] praying. It was now the
[1:23:30] spirit that was speaking to
[1:23:33] God. He was
[1:23:36] um he was he was
[1:23:40] desperated. Why did the prophet preacher
[1:23:42] desperated?
[1:23:46] Why did the prophet preacher get getting
[1:23:48] into the spirit? That's where are
[1:23:51] results.
[1:23:53] That's where there are
[1:23:55] results. The brother
[1:23:59] understood God can also answer
[1:24:02] me. And when the brother came
[1:24:04] to it started by
[1:24:06] saying, I could not imagine
[1:24:09] myself that God could answer
[1:24:12] me. How can you not think of me?
[1:24:16] How did you become a
[1:24:19] Christian? How did you become a
[1:24:22] Christian? Meaning that you walking with
[1:24:24] doubt without understanding that is able
[1:24:30] to answer your prayer. Yes, my brother.
[1:24:34] God is able to answer you. That's why he
[1:24:38] says in his
[1:24:39] word everyone that
[1:24:41] is must
[1:24:43] understand that God
[1:24:45] is he must have faith that God
[1:24:50] is and he is the rewarder to them that
[1:24:54] didn't and that is the first class you
[1:24:57] cannot
[1:24:58] come and have doubt that God God can use
[1:25:02] you.
[1:25:04] That's right. Amen. Can somebody say
[1:25:06] amen?
[1:25:08] Let me tell you something. At
[1:25:11] times we die with our diseases.
[1:25:15] We suffer in our
[1:25:18] issues because there are there's a lack
[1:25:21] of faith inside of
[1:25:23] us because we we have lack of ability to
[1:25:28] concentrate. God's law is simple.
[1:25:32] God answers to his children by two ways.
[1:25:36] The
[1:25:38] first he answers by his own
[1:25:41] will. You can come to God, God, I have
[1:25:45] answer. Answer
[1:25:47] me. I have issues in my business. Answer
[1:25:50] me. God can
[1:25:53] say I'll answer according to my will.
[1:25:57] But I'll tell you in the first step if
[1:26:01] you apply
[1:26:02] it you will always be
[1:26:04] disappointed. But
[1:26:07] us who are living in the world of
[1:26:11] spirit. We take the second
[1:26:13] option. What is the
[1:26:16] second? By the way of his
[1:26:18] word. Faith in his word.
[1:26:23] The right mental attitude.
[1:26:27] That's why the prophet
[1:26:29] say the right mental
[1:26:32] attitude to any promise of
[1:26:35] God. God is
[1:26:38] obligated not by his
[1:26:40] will not
[1:26:44] tomorrow even now. Now let's read it.
[1:26:48] That's right.
[1:26:52] You must understand it
[1:26:55] because you can put yourself in a in a
[1:26:57] storage.
[1:27:01] God comes and you come and ask something
[1:27:02] to God.
[1:27:07] And God tells you that I'll answer you
[1:27:08] in
[1:27:13] 2030. I'll answer you in 2050
[1:27:17] and you'll stay
[1:27:18] there. We're waiting.
[1:27:21] 2050.
[1:27:23] Wait.
[1:27:24] We not waiting.
[1:27:27] We getting into another
[1:27:31] domain. We need that thing right away.
[1:27:33] Now, now and it will come out.
[1:27:38] And since you're saying that, you know,
[1:27:40] I'm waiting God's will. Okay, wait for
[1:27:42] God's will then.
[1:27:48] I'm in the sermon,
[1:27:50] the unchangeable God.
[1:27:54] Even already the title is a strong
[1:27:58] one. I can go on record for
[1:28:03] this. I can go or I can state this
[1:28:06] morning.
[1:28:08] If any
[1:28:11] people will take the right mental
[1:28:14] attitude
[1:28:17] toward any divine
[1:28:20] promises that God has ever
[1:28:24] made and claim it for
[1:28:28] yours as for yours you
[1:28:32] follow. He
[1:28:35] will. God will bring it to
[1:28:39] passitude if you'll take the right
[1:28:42] attitude toward
[1:28:45] it. Knowing that if God says
[1:28:49] so, the promise is
[1:28:52] yours. It is
[1:28:55] yours. It is your personal
[1:28:58] property. Listen to this.
[1:29:01] the very
[1:29:03] minute, not the
[1:29:06] day. God is not of
[1:29:10] tomorrow. God is not of
[1:29:14] yesterday. God is always taken at
[1:29:16] present
[1:29:17] tense is
[1:29:20] always tells
[1:29:22] you the very minute
[1:29:26] you receive it.
[1:29:29] That way,
[1:29:32] I'm sorry.
[1:29:36] the very minute you receive it that
[1:29:41] way then because Jesus said the word is
[1:29:44] a seed that is
[1:29:47] so and a
[1:29:50] seed if it's a dramatized seed and it
[1:29:54] goes into the
[1:29:56] ground then that seed listen carefully
[1:30:01] you
[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:02] follow that
[1:30:06] under the right
[1:30:08] conditions of the sun and
[1:30:12] motion will bring forth the life that's
[1:30:15] in the
[1:30:19] seed and so is the word of
[1:30:23] God. If a person can take the word and
[1:30:27] place it in the
[1:30:29] heart and give
[1:30:31] it either the right
[1:30:34] sunshine, the right
[1:30:37] temperature, not the
[1:30:39] su, but says in English, but the s the
[1:30:44] su
[1:30:45] n, but the s o n at the right
[1:30:49] temperature.
[1:30:52] Uh bear with me with my English
[1:30:55] here and and the
[1:30:58] right and the right temperature of faith
[1:31:01] in that
[1:31:03] seed and a
[1:31:05] promise will
[1:31:09] leave to you just like it did at the
[1:31:14] beginning to to the one it was given
[1:31:17] to because it's God's word.
[1:31:23] And he is the same yesterday, today and
[1:31:26] forever. Can somebody say amen to the
[1:31:29] word? Somebody say amen to the word. You
[1:31:32] see
[1:31:33] here it is the second
[1:31:35] option because I know very
[1:31:38] well. Even while I'm talking, I prayed
[1:31:42] to God yesterday. May God help
[1:31:45] me. I don't know your
[1:31:47] issues. But I know very
[1:31:49] wellph that I am pro
[1:31:52] prophesizing. While I am
[1:31:54] prophesizing there, there's the ability
[1:31:57] that you who are
[1:31:59] listening, you listening to this word
[1:32:02] and believe
[1:32:04] in don't say that it will happen
[1:32:07] tomorrow. Don't take the
[1:32:10] option of the will of God because if you
[1:32:14] take God's
[1:32:15] will his will can say that he can heal
[1:32:18] you
[1:32:20] today that's the option that can also
[1:32:22] work
[1:32:24] well I'll show you in the
[1:32:26] Bible you know
[1:32:28] anas
[1:32:31] anas God's
[1:32:33] will it was that for him to die the same
[1:32:37] day king Uh uh
[1:32:41] what's the name of the king?
[1:32:48] God's will for him to
[1:32:51] die to get married because he was going
[1:32:54] to
[1:32:55] die. He was God. He sends his prophet.
[1:32:59] He says he
[1:33:02] say get ready because you'll die.
[1:33:08] Ezek looks around say,
[1:33:11] "Well, I'll leave the
[1:33:16] earth. My my my child my child is
[1:33:19] pregnant.
[1:33:21] I haven't seen my my my granddaughters
[1:33:26] yet. I still have this project to
[1:33:31] med." Looked
[1:33:33] around. You say, "Well, it's God's
[1:33:36] will." But something crosses
[1:33:39] mind. There's another
[1:33:43] option to uh cut around the God's
[1:33:48] will because God doesn't only have one
[1:33:51] option. He also has have another
[1:33:54] one. I'll take the other
[1:33:57] one and the answer will be given to you
[1:34:02] and took the other
[1:34:05] option and he said he said Lord forgive
[1:34:09] me Lord look you say your word say you
[1:34:14] are a merciful God Lord you know you you
[1:34:18] forgive forgive Lord listen
[1:34:23] God the same God, the same
[1:34:27] prophet, he had to go back to say that
[1:34:32] God just a change mind. Instead of you
[1:34:36] dying
[1:34:37] today instead of you dying tomorrow, you
[1:34:40] have 15 years when even the 15 years you
[1:34:44] have the time to do your project. You
[1:34:47] have the time to do
[1:34:48] everything. He took the second option
[1:34:52] and I can imagine the prayer
[1:34:56] that
[1:34:58] was he was not a carnal
[1:35:02] prayer. He will found himself in the
[1:35:05] spirit. Oh let me tell
[1:35:07] you when we speak about
[1:35:11] concentration you have to put aside
[1:35:14] everything that is align with your
[1:35:17] request. You have you have to check only
[1:35:20] the thing that you have needed. You take
[1:35:24] it. You look at what the devil has
[1:35:26] murdered to you. You look at the
[1:35:29] shame. You look at the
[1:35:32] humiliation. You look at that issue. And
[1:35:36] then now the tears start to falling
[1:35:40] now for you to
[1:35:42] leave. They can even touch you. But you
[1:35:45] cannot even speak.
[1:35:47] Why can't you fulfill
[1:35:49] it because you are in a different world
[1:35:52] in that
[1:35:53] world takes over the flesh because the
[1:35:58] spirit doesn't always align with the
[1:36:01] flesh.
[1:36:04] The
[1:36:06] flesh to be to have strength you must
[1:36:08] keep.
[1:36:10] But in the spirit to be strong you have
[1:36:12] to fast.
[1:36:14] always contra
[1:36:18] contradicting. Therefore, when you
[1:36:21] get with that world of
[1:36:25] spirit, you'll always be in the heights.
[1:36:28] But now I'll give
[1:36:30] you techniques on how to get into that
[1:36:34] world. I I've given you one thing. You
[1:36:37] must gather
[1:36:40] everything, everything that you have
[1:36:42] need as
[1:36:43] request and you have put aside all the
[1:36:46] rest of things. I say all the rest of
[1:36:49] things that are not your request and you
[1:36:53] put them
[1:36:55] together. Now in that
[1:36:57] case you cannot be
[1:37:00] distracted and they pray on
[1:37:02] concentration. They cannot call you over
[1:37:04] on the phone. You're praying Lord, Lord.
[1:37:07] You take the
[1:37:08] phone and I'm in prayer. I'll call you
[1:37:10] back. Lord, Lord, Lord, no. That that
[1:37:15] doesn't even get there. It's just
[1:37:18] roaming around the room
[1:37:20] here. You are praying Lord, Lord, Lord.
[1:37:23] And the child come and start disturbing.
[1:37:26] I'm praying go back. Lord, Lord, Lord.
[1:37:30] That is only spinning around
[1:37:32] here. That's right.
[1:37:35] Even the words you're saying to
[1:37:37] God, you must control those words.
[1:37:43] Your your language is English.
[1:37:46] Pray in English.
[1:37:49] God is God of all the
[1:37:51] languages. Pray in English. That's your
[1:37:53] language.
[1:37:56] Pray in such a manner that when you
[1:37:58] pulling up, let it not be
[1:38:02] something that is withholding you to so
[1:38:05] high.
[1:38:07] If your language is
[1:38:09] French and don't say that I'll try now
[1:38:11] to impress people. The fact of you
[1:38:14] trying to impress people, you destroy
[1:38:17] you destroying your prayer.
[1:38:21] You you speak Spanish.
[1:38:26] Spanish instead of you praying in
[1:38:29] Spanish and you said that I'll pray in
[1:38:32] English and when you
[1:38:37] pray that's the second instead that your
[1:38:41] mind to be connected to
[1:38:47] God but your mind is connected to
[1:38:53] dictionary you try not to adjust the
[1:38:56] grammar, how to put
[1:39:00] this how they in English has to adjust
[1:39:03] in
[1:39:05] Spanish there already you are already
[1:39:08] wasting
[1:39:10] time but pray in the
[1:39:13] language that you feel that when I pray
[1:39:15] in this language there's nothing that is
[1:39:19] holding me to go into everything and I
[1:39:23] Pray we will never
[1:39:27] miss brother. The spirit of war it
[1:39:30] doesn't miss.
[1:39:32] You can be there like this. You want to
[1:39:34] go
[1:39:35] out or you so you feel something tells
[1:39:37] you like you know don't go out. It
[1:39:40] doesn't
[1:39:42] miss. It doesn't
[1:39:45] lie. It always says the truth. Amen.
[1:39:50] Now listen,
[1:39:52] this world here
[1:39:54] and to explore it it's easy
[1:39:57] because the prophet has given us
[1:40:00] advices. There are two
[1:40:02] elements that can help
[1:40:05] you to work in that
[1:40:07] world. The first
[1:40:09] element is meditation.
[1:40:14] The second is the thought or your mind.
[1:40:19] These two elements
[1:40:22] will connect you. That's right.
[1:40:26] In that spiritual domain
[1:40:29] and the concentration will be
[1:40:33] real that lives in that
[1:40:36] world. I was uh wondering
[1:40:40] myself the things that the prophet was
[1:40:43] able to
[1:40:45] do. If the Holy Spirit that was in the
[1:40:49] prophet is in us as
[1:40:53] believers, aren't we able to do the very
[1:40:56] same thing even to a to a level to a
[1:40:59] degree? I understood one thing. When I
[1:41:03] when I read the
[1:41:12] prophet, he he lives more in that
[1:41:15] spiritual world than in this earthly
[1:41:18] world.
[1:41:20] But let me tell
[1:41:23] you, the one that spends more time in
[1:41:25] the spiritual
[1:41:27] world is able to fulfill an unachievable
[1:41:32] things, impossible
[1:41:35] things. He doesn't need to touch you to
[1:41:38] lay his hands on you for
[1:41:43] eternity to walk by you and die
[1:41:46] in if you have evil
[1:41:49] spirit. He doesn't need to deliver
[1:41:52] you. He only needs to speak not only to
[1:41:56] speak. But the devil can speak and to
[1:42:00] start talking by itself. Why?
[1:42:05] Because you spending more time in the
[1:42:07] spiritual
[1:42:09] world and that world requires
[1:42:12] discipline. That's right.
[1:42:16] You in that domain. You there.
[1:42:20] You talk a
[1:42:21] lot. A Christian doesn't talk a lot.
[1:42:24] That's right.
[1:42:27] You
[1:42:31] there all day long. You only talking
[1:42:33] talking talking
[1:42:35] that's not
[1:42:38] meditation your mind
[1:42:42] must be connected to the
[1:42:47] word gives
[1:42:49] you it says
[1:42:52] then you can raise the dead
[1:42:55] right then
[1:42:58] you can cleanse the leopard
[1:43:02] Then you can cast out
[1:43:05] demons. When you look in the
[1:43:08] Bible, you see that one time there was a
[1:43:11] spirit and there was even a child
[1:43:16] of the disciples were used to always
[1:43:20] talk
[1:43:21] talk always
[1:43:23] debating and all of a sudden they bring
[1:43:26] them again. Then they were coming back
[1:43:28] from the mountain. They've seen all the
[1:43:31] supernatural.
[1:43:33] Now imagine people who went eye on the
[1:43:36] mountain of Jesus. They said if they
[1:43:37] seen Elijah, they've seen
[1:43:40] Moses. They've seen all the
[1:43:42] supernatural, all the great vision. And
[1:43:45] when they came back down and what kind
[1:43:47] of things people have seen are us, we
[1:43:51] are
[1:43:54] the what we have seen the
[1:43:57] power and James would say. Yeah. That
[1:44:00] you're right.
[1:44:02] Oh, we raise all kind of beds and all of
[1:44:05] a
[1:44:06] sudden they bring them a child and this
[1:44:09] child doesn't work.
[1:44:11] Yeah, let me I'll
[1:44:13] pray. Oh, you demon
[1:44:16] of the devil even worsened the
[1:44:19] case. Come and
[1:44:22] try because the disciples said that if
[1:44:25] you came down from the mountain, we were
[1:44:27] here. We were we didn't pray much but
[1:44:30] you came down from the mountain.
[1:44:32] They
[1:44:33] tried they tried they they did they
[1:44:36] fell.
[1:44:40] Now you'll see you'll notice now
[1:44:43] that now the words that Jesus now told
[1:44:46] them that's what attracted me the
[1:44:51] most. They went to see Jesus master. We
[1:44:56] prayed the the the devil established
[1:44:59] they don't want to go out. We were
[1:45:03] worried. How can we cast out demons?
[1:45:06] When the devil get involved in
[1:45:08] others, the word tells us we shall cast
[1:45:12] out demons and the
[1:45:15] devil. How come did we apply the word
[1:45:19] and the word didn't come to pass?
[1:45:22] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:45:24] today and
[1:45:27] forever. It's not a mistake
[1:45:30] of the question is not the word because
[1:45:34] many make
[1:45:36] mistakes. They are accusing the
[1:45:39] world. It's not the problem
[1:45:41] of it's not even the
[1:45:45] pastor's because by looking the
[1:45:48] pastor, he's a spiritual. He has the
[1:45:50] Holy Ghost.
[1:45:52] says when you talk with somebody 5
[1:45:53] minutes, you know who you are. It's not
[1:45:56] even
[1:45:57] his. It's not the deacon's issue,
[1:46:01] but it is your problem.
[1:46:04] What is the level of your
[1:46:07] faith? What's your faith
[1:46:10] level? Brother
[1:46:13] says, "The problem is not what you are
[1:46:17] saying, but what is inside of you.
[1:46:21] your faith because you
[1:46:24] can but in you there's no faith you
[1:46:28] don't
[1:46:29] believe the thing won't work
[1:46:32] Jesus
[1:46:34] came he said one
[1:46:37] word and the de devil left the
[1:46:40] child
[1:46:41] master we don't
[1:46:43] understand we did it didn't
[1:46:47] work Jesus
[1:46:49] said Until when how long will I how long
[1:46:54] will I be with you?
[1:46:57] I am in the
[1:46:59] concentration. I don't talk
[1:47:01] much. I always
[1:47:05] meditate. You always debating and all
[1:47:08] all kind of
[1:47:09] things. Peter, you always talk. You
[1:47:12] always asking questions.
[1:47:16] But now look,
[1:47:18] there are demons.
[1:47:21] that can only live by
[1:47:24] fasting. There are levels of
[1:47:26] demons. Now we getting
[1:47:29] deeper. There are level of
[1:47:32] demons. There are level of demons
[1:47:35] whereby requires
[1:47:39] concentration before getting coming
[1:47:43] here. Something happened at my church.
[1:47:48] uh my trustees child
[1:47:50] [Music]
[1:47:52] uh drowned in the in the
[1:47:54] bathroom and uh he passed.
[1:48:02] Uh the song song leaders went or the
[1:48:04] singers went to at home.
[1:48:08] They prayed.
[1:48:11] The brother went and
[1:48:14] they did all they knew to do.
[1:48:19] I tell you that back home we don't know
[1:48:22] they about the
[1:48:25] ambulance when it's us something happens
[1:48:27] to us it's all about ourselves
[1:48:32] first that also helped us that when
[1:48:34] there's a problem is first we look to
[1:48:40] God they tried everything it didn't work
[1:48:44] they called
[1:48:45] measure said, "Pastor,
[1:48:50] here the pastor's child has just passed.
[1:48:54] We did
[1:48:55] everything. We see that it doesn't
[1:48:59] matter." I told them like, "You know,
[1:49:01] wait, I'm
[1:49:04] coming. Before meeting, I was at home. I
[1:49:08] prayed first.
[1:49:10] I said, "Lord,
[1:49:14] I refuse this child death.
[1:49:18] I refuse it.
[1:49:20] You must bring him
[1:49:24] back. How come
[1:49:26] Sunday we coming from church and all of
[1:49:30] a
[1:49:32] sudden on it was on a Sunday? How come
[1:49:35] people will say no do something?
[1:49:41] I went by the trustees.
[1:49:44] When I got there,
[1:49:46] there was all kind of alarms.
[1:49:50] I took the
[1:49:52] child. I didn't pray. I didn't pray for
[1:49:55] the
[1:49:56] child. I just put him on the
[1:49:59] bed. I called the child. Paradox
[1:50:03] and the child came back to life.
[1:50:06] I am on the pulpit.
[1:50:09] The child that came back to
[1:50:13] life in me.
[1:50:16] I didn't see any
[1:50:18] failure in
[1:50:22] me. I didn't see
[1:50:24] anything that this sh to come back to
[1:50:26] life. Amen.
[1:50:30] When we are
[1:50:32] Christian, the world in which we have to
[1:50:35] stay is in the spiritual
[1:50:38] world. Control what you're
[1:50:41] saying. Control what we meditating
[1:50:46] upon because it affects your spiritual
[1:50:51] world. The spiritual world doesn't work
[1:50:53] like the
[1:51:00] The spiritual world work with our
[1:51:02] mind. Amen.
[1:51:04] Amen. And now keep those two. We're
[1:51:08] going to
[1:51:10] read I have 15 minutes. In my 10
[1:51:15] minutes, there's something that is going
[1:51:18] to help you.
[1:51:23] And now Bernham speaks about Mary.
[1:51:32] You are you remember that Mary was a 17
[1:51:34] year old girl.
[1:51:36] Mary went to
[1:51:41] church. The the priest took the the book
[1:51:45] of the prophecies. He gave the
[1:51:49] promise. a virgin shall
[1:51:53] conceive. There were many
[1:51:57] girls. The the promise could get to
[1:52:00] anyone,
[1:52:04] but Mary went into the spiritual world.
[1:52:08] How did she do
[1:52:10] it? She left
[1:52:12] church. She got into her
[1:52:15] mind that prophecy,
[1:52:19] a virgin shall
[1:52:20] conceive a con shall conceive.
[1:52:24] How meaning a
[1:52:27] virgin since a girl God said
[1:52:31] it after a
[1:52:33] moment she started meditating.
[1:52:38] It's while she was meditating
[1:52:42] then the angel
[1:52:45] appeared and brother even gives
[1:52:51] advice. If you want the angel to you, if
[1:52:55] you want the angel to appear to
[1:52:57] you, think on the
[1:53:01] word and the angel will visit you. It's
[1:53:05] not
[1:53:07] hard. It's not a
[1:53:11] but it's a spiritual world.
[1:53:17] I mean the sermon Jehovah of
[1:53:22] miracles November
[1:53:26] 26 paragraph 65
[1:53:29] 67 that will try us to
[1:53:34] uh and as she was thinking
[1:53:39] not noticing who was around
[1:53:42] her. The little lady perhaps had a p
[1:53:48] person walking along this little dusty
[1:53:53] path, but thinking of the
[1:53:56] Lord and of his
[1:54:00] promises of things to
[1:54:03] come and the thing of things to come.
[1:54:08] And as she was
[1:54:12] thinking and all of a sudden that
[1:54:14] feeling got so
[1:54:16] great until she raised
[1:54:19] up. And when she still she she did
[1:54:22] standing before I
[1:54:25] was and standing by the light was
[1:54:28] Gabriel the angel of the
[1:54:30] arch. And brother is advising
[1:54:34] you. If you want angels to appear to
[1:54:38] you, keep your mind on
[1:54:42] God of the things of the
[1:54:45] world.
[1:54:47] Listen, he said that he doesn't refuse
[1:54:50] you to go to
[1:54:51] about go to your
[1:54:54] business, go to your
[1:54:56] church, go to washing your dishes,
[1:54:59] whenever you wherever you are,
[1:55:04] keep your mind on
[1:55:07] him all day
[1:55:09] long and all night long.
[1:55:14] And a God will do
[1:55:16] something. You drawing
[1:55:20] night. You got you got to the You got
[1:55:23] the world
[1:55:25] shut. You got the world shut
[1:55:29] up. You and he are
[1:55:32] together.
[1:55:34] Listen
[1:55:36] says this appearing of the angel
[1:55:40] frightened the little virgin. She had
[1:55:42] been
[1:55:44] taught that the days of miracle was
[1:55:47] passed.
[1:55:49] But she had seen something
[1:55:52] happen. The angel of her I say hail
[1:55:56] Mary. Hail
[1:55:59] Mary. Hail
[1:56:00] Mary means to
[1:56:04] stop and he had a message for her. And
[1:56:08] when he's got a message for you and the
[1:56:11] Holy Ghost, God's
[1:56:14] angel is here
[1:56:18] tonight with a message for every
[1:56:23] believer. Just keep your mind on
[1:56:27] him. Keep thinking about
[1:56:30] him. How lovely he is. How sweet he
[1:56:35] is of his
[1:56:38] promises. If you
[1:56:40] sick, get this on your
[1:56:43] mind. He was wounded for my
[1:56:46] transgression. He was bruised for my
[1:56:50] iniquity. The chastisement of my peace
[1:56:54] was upon
[1:56:55] him. And by his stripes,
[1:56:59] I was
[1:57:01] healed. If your
[1:57:03] mind planted like that, there
[1:57:07] something will happen to you all of a
[1:57:11] sudden. There will be
[1:57:14] something draw to
[1:57:16] you. An anointing will come on
[1:57:20] you and about the church you walk. Draw
[1:57:25] night unto the Lord
[1:57:27] and he will draw night unto you. Yes
[1:57:32] sir. The promises are being fulfilled
[1:57:36] this. They are taking us
[1:57:39] somewhere and we have received a
[1:57:41] message. A super
[1:57:44] message, a mighty message.
[1:57:48] And all together we have to be we have
[1:57:51] to be mighty
[1:57:53] because even a
[1:57:55] church it doesn't grow by the
[1:57:58] church by the church doesn't grow by the
[1:58:00] number but by the power of
[1:58:03] God with a few members of the church.
[1:58:06] You must be
[1:58:07] able to manifest that
[1:58:10] power everywhere you
[1:58:12] be. I say everywhere believe.
[1:58:16] that get in the
[1:58:20] concentration pressing on the word of
[1:58:22] God. Meditate on the word of God. You'll
[1:58:25] see that God is
[1:58:27] real. He's able this
[1:58:29] morning to give you what you have made
[1:58:32] of don't. It all depends of your
[1:58:35] attitude. If your attitude is
[1:58:37] right, is your mind
[1:58:40] here. Are you meditating on the word?
[1:58:43] And I
[1:58:44] believe that what I have destroyed, I
[1:58:48] declare that he that came
[1:58:50] here because everything I have, I it's
[1:58:55] not and then go back
[1:58:57] without it won't be a
[1:59:02] good he who has
[1:59:04] a we
[1:59:09] can
[1:59:11] suffering the
[1:59:21] may give
[1:59:22] you. I declare in the name of Jesus if
[1:59:25] you were sick that the angel of the Lord
[1:59:29] may take care of the
[1:59:31] situation that elders you may be healed.
[1:59:34] If you had a situation that you were
[1:59:36] suffering, I
[1:59:38] declare every
[1:59:40] servant that you may go out of here all
[1:59:43] to free. May the Lord bless you.
[2:00:00] Wow. Amen.
[2:00:02] Yes, sir. Our faith has been encouraged
[2:00:05] today. Our faith has been encouraged
[2:00:09] today. The Lord is good. Let's stand
[2:00:11] this morning. Lord, increase our faith.
[2:00:14] May we step into that realm, not praying
[2:00:17] just in the body, but in the spirit as
[2:00:19] well. Amen. The Lord is good. Can you
[2:00:23] say amen? He's got it all in control.

[2:00:27] all in control. Can you see?
[2:00:30] He's got it all in control.
[2:00:36] What a wonderful word we heard this
[2:00:38] morning. Well, he's got it all in
[2:00:46] control. But that
[2:00:51] reassur talked about down in the soul.
[2:00:58] He's got it all together. We can lift
[2:01:02] our hands cuz we trust in the Father
[2:01:04] this
[2:01:05] morning. My father knows what I need.
[2:01:10] He's a provider
[2:01:13] today. My father knows what I need.
[2:01:22] Everything I go
[2:01:24] through, he knows what's best for me.
[2:01:32] My father knows my
[2:01:36] life where we put our trust and our
[2:01:39] everything. If I put my life, I put my
[2:01:42] life in his hand.
[2:01:48] Hallelujah. I put my heart
[2:01:55] down. So every road I walk
[2:02:01] down in
[2:02:06] his I put my
[2:02:09] life. He's got it all in control.
[2:02:15] He's got it all on
[2:02:22] control. He's got it all in
[2:02:30] control. That
[2:02:35] reassur in my soul.
[2:02:42] He's got it all in control.
[2:02:49] The mystery
[2:02:51] of concentration,
[2:02:55] getting into the right channel,
[2:02:58] the right mental attitude,
[2:03:01] not woe is me. Why did this happen?
[2:03:06] But understand that he's got it all in
[2:03:08] control.
[2:03:10] Hallelujah.
[2:03:13] Not asking why is this but what am I
[2:03:17] supposed to learn?
[2:03:20] What are you teaching me?
[2:03:23] And if we will focus, see that's what
[2:03:25] the concentration means to focus.
[2:03:29] I love the illustration.
[2:03:31] Hey, not the cell phone, not
[2:03:35] anybody breaking in and saying, "Hey, I
[2:03:38] need to talk to you." No. Focused.
[2:03:41] focused.
[2:03:42] [Music]
[2:03:43] When you get focused on him,
[2:03:48] things happen.
[2:03:51] Yeah.
[2:03:52] Hezekiah, thus sayeth the Lord, you're
[2:03:54] going to die. Get ready.
[2:03:59] I like how brother Sam goes.
[2:04:05] What? Now I want to ask you, yeah, there
[2:04:08] are two thus sayaith the Lords that are
[2:04:10] given to Hezekiah. Yes, sir. Thus sayith
[2:04:13] the Lord, you're going to die.
[2:04:16] If you stop there,
[2:04:18] he's dead. Yes, sir. But he focused.
[2:04:24] He turned his face towards the wall. He
[2:04:27] put everything behind him and he
[2:04:29] concentrated and he focused on God.
[2:04:36] Yes sir. Amen. The mystery of
[2:04:39] concentration
[2:04:42] and while he focused
[2:04:45] while he concentrated while he meditated
[2:04:47] on the things of God. Here the prophet
[2:04:50] is going away he gave him thus sayith
[2:04:51] the Lord.
[2:04:55] But there is a higher court of appeal.
[2:04:59] Hallelujah. Why? God is God. He wants to
[2:05:03] heal. He wants to deliver. He wants to
[2:05:07] set you free.
[2:05:09] Amen.
[2:05:11] If you'll concentrate on that,
[2:05:14] not on the situation.
[2:05:17] And when he
[2:05:18] focused, the prophet had to turn.
[2:05:23] Yes. Hezekiah.
[2:05:26] Thus sayaith the Lord. You're going to
[2:05:28] live. Hallelujah.
[2:05:31] Praise the Lord.
[2:05:34] Faith
[2:05:36] is the language that God speaks.
[2:05:40] Not intellect, not knowledge,
[2:05:43] not science,
[2:05:45] not education,
[2:05:49] revelation. Yes, sir. And when you
[2:05:52] concentrate,
[2:05:54] you
[2:05:56] focus Beautiful.

[2:06:29] Hospital during the church service.
[2:06:33] She had chest pains and high blood
[2:06:35] pressure.
[2:06:38] Can we concentrate right now?
[2:06:42] Can we focus? How many of you say I'll
[2:06:44] focus? Let's pray right now. Father God,
[2:06:49] we focus ourselves
[2:06:51] and our mind. We bring every thought
[2:06:55] under the obedience to Christ in the
[2:06:58] word. And we are thinking right now of
[2:07:01] Sister Josie,
[2:07:04] not of the chest
[2:07:06] pains, not of the blood pressure, but of
[2:07:09] your word. Your word says that by your
[2:07:14] stripes we are healed. Therefore, we
[2:07:19] concentrate. We focus our faith.
[2:07:23] Father, I speak it in the name of Jesus
[2:07:26] Christ. May Sister Joseph be completely
[2:07:29] touched and be made

[2:10:38] attitude, all things are
[2:10:42] possible. Father, may there be miracle
[2:10:45] after miracle.
[2:10:49] Father, not because some pastor prayed
[2:10:52] or some deacon
[2:10:55] prayed, but because your people prayed.
[2:11:00] The body of Christ,
[2:11:02] the mystical body of
[2:11:06] God, spoke the word themsself.
[2:11:11] I pray, oh heavenly father,
