[37:00] things just go by like

[37:05] for me this morning too the Lord help me
[37:08] because it's never easy I as a pastor
[37:11] carry very uh big burden on my heart for
[37:16] the whole church amen so if you just
[37:21] remain standing and turn with me to the
[37:23] book of First John 1 John chapter 4
[37:27] amen thank you
[37:29] musicians yeah enjoyed the songs
[37:34] amen if you understand those songs one
[37:36] of them and who I am have to deal with
[37:42] identity this message has brought to you
[37:45] an identity of who you are where you
[37:48] come from where you're
[37:50] going it's all about positioning and
[37:52] placing once you know who you are you
[37:54] take your position in the body of Christ
[37:57] doesn't mean that things are going to be
[37:59] easy doesn't mean that the road is not
[38:01] going to have some bends some turns some
[38:04] potholes some different things that just
[38:06] may turn you around but you know what
[38:08] God is our God and you know what uh when
[38:14] it's all said and done when your heart
[38:15] stops
[38:17] here all of a
[38:19] sudden you will break into a whole
[38:22] another
[38:23] dimension Hallelujah brother Mike sister
[38:26] py it's good good to have you here I
[38:29] think I miss you every time we have
[38:31] service I think about
[38:35] uh how that
[38:37] God sent to us this
[38:41] message I remember the first time I
[38:43] heard
[38:46] it something
[38:49] struck 18y old kid
[38:58] set my heart on
[39:04] fire everything is about positioning and
[39:09] placing and since that time I've been
[39:12] tried my very best to just stay in my
[39:16] position be faithful love God raise my
[39:20] children and nurture and admonition of
[39:22] the Lord go to church and do those
[39:26] things which is right and is pleasing to
[39:29] him
[39:32] amen and uh so we're going to continue
[39:37] on with this thought here about trying
[39:39] the spirits that are within the
[39:42] message and I want you in 1 John 4 and
[39:48] one let me see I could get my glasses
[39:56] here 1 John
[40:00] 4:1
[40:01] beloved believe not every
[40:05] Spirit but try the
[40:08] spirits whether they are of God because
[40:12] many false prophets are gone out into
[40:15] the
[40:16] world turn with me if you would to the
[40:18] book of
[40:20] Galatians Galatians my wife and I having
[40:25] our devotion
[40:28] yesterday
[40:30] morning we were in the book of
[40:33] Galatians and it was so fitting as I was
[40:36] reading this with her in our devotion I
[40:39] thought I would read it this morning
[40:42] also Galatians 1: 6 through uh
[40:46] 12 I Marvel that you are so soon
[40:50] removed from him that called you under
[40:52] the grace of Christ unto another gospel
[40:58] which is not another but there be some
[41:00] that trouble
[41:01] you and would pervert the gospel of
[41:07] Christ but though we or an angel from
[41:10] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[41:12] than that which we have preached unto
[41:15] you let him be a
[41:19] cursed as we said before so I say now
[41:22] again if any man preach any other gospel
[41:25] unto you than that ye have received let
[41:29] him be a
[41:32] cursed for do I now persuade man or
[41:37] God or do I seek to please
[41:41] men for if I yet please men I should not
[41:45] be the servant of
[41:48] Christ but I certify you Brethren that
[41:51] the gospel which was preached of me is
[41:55] not after men
[41:57] for neither I received it of man neither
[42:02] was I taught
[42:03] it but by the
[42:06] revelation of Jesus
[42:09] Christ amen that is the way that the
[42:14] church and its foundation is built upon
[42:17] turn with me Revelation chap
[42:21] 2 very last book of the
[42:24] Bible Revelation chap 2
[42:29] verse
[42:30] two I Know Thy works and thy labor and
[42:34] thy
[42:35] patience and now how thou can not bear
[42:39] with them which are
[42:41] evil and thou has tried them which say
[42:44] they are
[42:46] Apostles and are
[42:48] not and has found them
[42:50] Liars may God add the blessing to the
[42:53] reading of his word you may be seated
[42:55] this morning in the presence of the
[42:57] Lord continuing on I'm going to go quite
[43:01] quickly I've got quite a bit of
[43:05] um ground to cover this
[43:09] morning and I want to title again the
[43:13] sermon as trying the spirits within the
[43:16] message part
[43:19] three and the subject of discerning of
[43:24] spirits now I want to say that my time
[43:28] of navity and innocence is long
[43:33] gone I've got experience I've been down
[43:36] the road a few
[43:38] miles I've been here done that I've seen
[43:41] others rise up come go and the prophet
[43:45] of God says I look and I see the heaps
[43:48] of ministers and wrecks alongside the
[43:51] road because they failed to go into this
[43:53] thing
[43:55] correctly amen so I'm speaking to you
[43:59] this morning as an
[44:01] elder as one who's
[44:04] experienced who looks at things perhaps
[44:07] a little bit differently I'm not so
[44:09] quick to you know just Embrace everyone
[44:13] anymore and say oh yeah everybody's in
[44:15] the message now let me see fruits
[44:19] first
[44:23] amen and I want you to know that we have
[44:26] now entered entered into the greatest
[44:28] time of deception the message has ever
[44:33] known yeah we're here we have arrived
[44:36] we're at the time as it's been in every
[44:39] age that after the messenger comes
[44:42] preaches his message gives us thus
[44:44] sayeth the Lord and after he departs
[44:47] guess what you have the Grievious wolves
[44:50] that come in among
[44:51] you wolves and sheep's clothing they say
[44:55] and act
[44:57] so much of the time that they say oh I'm
[45:00] of God I've got a word oh God showed me
[45:03] this God show me that and they add to
[45:05] and take away from the message of the
[45:07] hour and next thing you know it's no
[45:09] longer per uh pure becomes hybrid and
[45:12] loses its
[45:18] power it's the most deceptive time
[45:22] brother Brenham told us he said look and
[45:25] I just am going to quote the quote to
[45:27] you again he said when the true church
[45:30] gets a true
[45:31] revelation of who she is it's all about
[45:35] identity Revelation is bringing to you
[45:38] identity identity brings to you
[45:42] placing positioning
[45:46] amen when she gets a true revelation of
[45:49] who she
[45:50] is and begins to discern and
[45:54] withstand the Antichrist spirit that is
[45:57] within the framework of the
[46:01] church so like I said this
[46:04] is um a very sobering message this is
[46:10] not one of these messages that will get
[46:12] you all excited and jumping and shouting
[46:15] no it's a
[46:16] warning warning than
[46:19] judgment when brother brenon preached
[46:21] certain sermons there wasn't a lot of
[46:25] shouting trying to do God a
[46:28] service anointed ones at the end
[46:33] time he began to preach sermons that
[46:36] gave you
[46:39] warning and began to set the path
[46:43] straight so that you understand that
[46:46] there's coming a time when these false
[46:50] prophets false teachers will come on the
[46:53] scene and they as the scripture say
[46:57] will deceive the very
[47:01] elect except that God shortened the
[47:04] days so God shorten the
[47:08] days because there is so much deception
[47:11] and I'm going to go into this and I'm
[47:14] not going after any
[47:18] Minister I'm not going after any
[47:22] Doctrine any church in particular
[47:27] I'm preaching the whole Council of
[47:32] God so I don't want anyone to think well
[47:35] he's preaching about this one or he's
[47:36] preaching about that
[47:38] one and those that listen to the sermons
[47:41] on the internet who may be not even part
[47:45] of our church or whatever and they're
[47:46] just kind of checking me out that's good
[47:49] I want you
[47:50] to I want you to check it
[47:54] out I am not a novice I've been around
[47:57] around and I kind of feel like Joshua
[48:00] who's been into battle so much that
[48:01] finally the angel of the Lord stands
[48:03] there before him an angel stood there
[48:06] before Joshua and guess what Joshua did
[48:09] he drew his sword and he put it right on
[48:11] him and he said are you for
[48:14] us are you against
[48:17] us he'd been in battle so
[48:21] much are you for us or you against us he
[48:25] said Nay put up your Joshua I am the
[48:28] captain of The Lord of
[48:34] hosts thank you Lord I thought I was
[48:37] going to have to fight another
[48:41] one
[48:43] now
[48:46] um in the sermon the spoken word is the
[48:49] Original Seed I'm going to give you some
[48:51] quotes we're going to go quite quickly
[48:52] and those that are on back there brother
[48:54] Yesa just stay with me because I'm I'm
[48:56] going to go quickly and
[49:00] um let me get this
[49:04] here so what this was both physical and
[49:06] spiritual with Eve first and any time
[49:11] anytime that a woman takes a wrong step
[49:13] I'm talking about Christ and the
[49:15] bride are we together he's saying look
[49:18] I'm talking about a physical room womb
[49:21] spiritual womb and anytime a woman takes
[49:24] a wrong step I'm talking about Christ
[49:27] and the
[49:28] bride but anytime a woman takes a wrong
[49:31] step she has to First receive it in her
[49:33] mind right some Slicker has to persuade
[49:36] her she listens to it against her own
[49:39] better judgment then the ACT is
[49:41] committed so first it hit Satan hit
[49:45] Eve's mind and then the womb of her mind
[49:49] she doubted God's word then come the
[49:52] actual
[49:53] act the Bible says and the serpent
[49:56] beguiled and she did eat begal means to
[49:58] seduce with
[50:00] words that's what he did he came by
[50:03] Brother R said it could have been
[50:05] hundreds of years he just kind of
[50:07] sitting and chatting with her and hey
[50:09] Eve and on and on it could have been but
[50:12] he used words God uses words Satan uses
[50:21] words did not Satan himself use words
[50:27] to the Lord Jesus himself cast yourself
[50:29] down for it is written but Jesus said it
[50:33] is also written amen imagine tempting
[50:37] the word with the
[50:41] word now watch this because we're going
[50:43] to take this into something here that I
[50:47] want all of you to understand how is
[50:49] spiritual adultery committed
[50:57] ah I tell you what I am not so quick to
[50:59] just let somebody come in here add to
[51:02] and take away and these Ministers of the
[51:05] message and if you're listening to me I
[51:07] want you to
[51:09] listen
[51:11] Okay that you start adding to and take
[51:14] away from the word of God I'm against
[51:19] you I'll draw my sword right and I'll
[51:23] say are you for us or you against us you
[51:26] think I'm going to sit there and let you
[51:28] play
[51:30] around one of the biggest things that's
[51:33] a biggest stumbling block the message
[51:37] has ever seen is the internet you got
[51:40] every false prophet every false teacher
[51:42] and all kinds of anointings and all
[51:44] kinds of churches and this and that and
[51:46] everybody's click click click next thing
[51:48] you know
[51:49] and it's like Elijah said why halt you
[51:51] between two opinions brother see years
[51:54] ago you really didn't hear about what
[51:56] who was preaching and what they were
[51:58] preaching and how they was preaching and
[52:00] everything but now you can just click
[52:01] click click and go
[52:04] to all over the world just listen to
[52:06] anybody and
[52:08] everything but I'm zealous over this
[52:11] church and this message with a Godly
[52:13] jealousy and I get angry I get upset
[52:16] when I see people even the congregation
[52:20] sitting there and gulping
[52:24] down things that are con contrary to the
[52:27] word of
[52:29] God swallow a
[52:32] camel strain it a
[52:35] net excuse
[52:38] me now brother Brenham goes on spoken
[52:41] word is the Original
[52:45] Seed there's a womb in the physical
[52:48] there's a womb for the spirit do you
[52:49] believe that there's a spiritual womb
[52:51] and physical womb the mind is the womb
[52:54] to the spirit
[52:57] that's how adultery is committed
[53:00] spiritually when you knowing better by
[53:03] the word of God by the Intercourse of
[53:07] the
[53:08] Mind take a lie of the devil against the
[53:11] word of God that's exactly what 've done
[53:15] with spiritual intercourse first she
[53:17] come by believing Satan's lie into the
[53:20] womb of her mind that polluted her soul
[53:22] set death in the soul then the
[53:25] then the a natural act taking
[53:28] place that's the only way that a woman
[53:31] can ever commit adultery against her
[53:33] husband first let some man talk her into
[53:36] it then receive another man that's not
[53:38] her husband then she's committed
[53:40] adultery and when the Bride of Jesus
[53:43] Christ lets man-made Creeds and dogmas
[53:47] take the place of the word of God she's
[53:48] committing
[53:50] adultery no adulterers nor fornicators
[53:54] will make it into the kingdom of heaven
[53:59] anytime you substitute anytime you
[54:02] interject anytime you misinterpret
[54:04] misplace a word you are guilty of adding
[54:06] to or taking away from the word of God
[54:09] and you're committing spiritual adultery
[54:11] on Christ's
[54:14] Worden we have entered now into the time
[54:17] of Matthew 24 we are in the Fulfillment
[54:20] of Matthew
[54:23] 24 many false prophets false
[54:27] teachers have been scattered out
[54:30] throughout the message each one of them
[54:32] gotten their own little thing trying to
[54:34] pull off little groups here and there
[54:35] and I got my stuff too and I oh you need
[54:38] this you're not making a Rapture unless
[54:40] you come follow me I beg to different
[54:42] with you brother R said a little old
[54:44] washer woman with one tape can make it
[54:47] how in a world you got to sit there and
[54:49] you listen the Revelation you need is
[54:51] the Revelation you get from Jesus Christ
[54:54] himself it ain't you don't get it from
[54:56] me you don't get it from any preacher it
[54:58] ain't because you belong to this church
[54:59] or that church you belong to Christ and
[55:01] he alone has the sovereignty of showing
[55:05] you the revelation of who he is thank
[55:09] you Lord when you know who he is you
[55:11] know who you
[55:14] are
[55:18] amen
[55:21] amen all kinds of false prophets false
[55:24] Christ showing Great Signs and wonders
[55:27] in so much that if it were possible
[55:29] they'll deceive the very
[55:32] elect my is this serious you better
[55:36] believe it it's serious so just sit down
[55:39] and
[55:42] listen let me give you an example of
[55:45] some of
[55:46] these Eighth Day
[55:48] Messengers ones who say oh H you know
[55:51] the prophet of God said it will not be
[55:53] two of us here at the same time why if I
[55:56] fulfilled what God want me to do guess
[55:58] what not be two of us here at the same
[56:00] time perhaps I've laid a foundation for
[56:02] another one to come after me I'll tell
[56:04] you what he laid a foundation but that
[56:06] Foundation was for the son of man that's
[56:09] the one that come after him was the son
[56:12] of man
[56:15] himself
[56:21] amen I have met so many of these Eighth
[56:24] Day
[56:25] Messengers I'm embarrassed they're in
[56:28] every
[56:29] country not just here in
[56:32] America I met them in Belgium and
[56:35] Holland
[56:36] France I met him
[56:41] I've I've met Joshua and
[56:44] calebs uhhuh I've met them I've I had
[56:48] different ones say I'm Joshua I'm
[56:50] Kaleb in fact they are that type Spirits
[56:53] the one that split brother brenham's
[56:55] Church
[56:57] prior to the opening of the seals
[56:59] according to a
[57:00] vision remember he's out there he sees
[57:03] his front yard all T up and the two

[57:42] Prescott and the influence of those two
[57:45] men

[58:11] books let me tell you there is but one
[58:14] Angel messenger there is one prophet of
[58:17] this hour that was sent to turn your

[58:34] prophet to this
[58:43] generation Moses and
[58:46] Elijah every country I'm Moses I'm
[58:50] Elijah you need to follow me I'll tell
[58:53] you what brother Brenham
[58:54] said we the two witnesses I even had
[58:58] them in my church in
[59:01] Texas
[59:03] yeah just a young boy here I was
[59:06] preaching and stuff I I didn't think I'd
[59:08] come up against stuff like that next
[59:11] thing you know I got some
[59:13] brother Anointed with a spirit and you
[59:16] talk about how he he would listen to the
[59:19] tapes of brother Brenham I told you
[59:21] before his wife went ahead and made him
[59:23] a garment made it a many colors like
[59:27] Joseph's Garment of many color he had a
[59:31] staff and on top of the staff he had a
[59:35] uh LED
[59:36] pyramid and he had his Walkman you
[59:40] remember the old Walkman well you could
[59:42] have these LEDs that when brother
[59:44] Brandon's voice he said good evening
[59:46] friends it would light up the pyramid on
[59:49] top of the staff and the staff was so
[59:51] many
[59:52] cubits oh everything was so spiritual
[59:56] and he walked at night because he said
[59:58] the word is a lamp unto our feet so when
[1:00:00] brother Brenan would talk it would light
[1:00:02] up around him and he'd walk around at
[1:00:04] night can you
[1:00:07] imagine well he came to church one day
[1:00:09] and said I'm I'm the Elijah another
[1:00:13] brother in the church said you can't be
[1:00:14] the Elijah I'm the
[1:00:19] Elijah and he influenced the other
[1:00:21] brother and said you need to burn that
[1:00:23] staff and everything he had batteries
[1:00:26] what what happens to batteries if you
[1:00:27] burn
[1:00:29] them yeah they explode yeah capish you
[1:00:32] understand he takes this he takes his
[1:00:34] staff he takes his Rob he puts all this
[1:00:36] stuff into fire and the one Prophet
[1:00:38] saying to the other PRI you need to burn
[1:00:40] that stuff so when he he was there and
[1:00:42] they were burning it all of a sudden
[1:00:44] guess what
[1:00:45] bow bigo explosion and the brother had a
[1:00:48] little pocket New Testament uh in his
[1:00:51] pocket right here and and the fire hit
[1:00:54] it and and bounced off in his his pocket
[1:00:56] got burnt he said but look see the word
[1:00:59] the word had saved
[1:01:01] me oh my I've
[1:01:05] had different ones I said when did you
[1:01:08] become the Elijah when Joseph Brenham
[1:01:11] shaved his
[1:01:13] beard what yeah that Spirit went from
[1:01:17] him to me so now and I said well Z yeah
[1:01:20] a prophet's got to have a beard since
[1:01:23] when's a prophet going to have a beard
[1:01:26] oh all of this kind of stuff what I'm
[1:01:28] saying saints of God we're talking about
[1:01:31] anointings we're talking about people
[1:01:39] sincere now I want you to understand let
[1:01:42] me see if I finish this because
[1:01:49] yeah in the Ephesian Church age go I'm
[1:01:51] going to show you remember brother Rand
[1:01:53] laid a
[1:01:56] a paper in the Cornerstone of his
[1:01:59] church look at this Ephesian Church AG
[1:02:04] now I believe in 27th verse I have not
[1:02:07] shun to declare unto you the whole
[1:02:09] counsel of God now listen what this this
[1:02:12] is a
[1:02:15] prophecy I'm going to go down a little
[1:02:18] further for I know this that after my
[1:02:20] departing shall Grievious wolves enter
[1:02:22] in among not sparing the flock also of
[1:02:25] your own
[1:02:26] elves watch that man could look down
[1:02:29] through that and see that coming and of
[1:02:31] your own selves men shall rise speaking
[1:02:34] perverse things to draw away disciples
[1:02:38] after
[1:02:41] them I'm going down to paragraph 84
[1:02:44] Ephesian Church age these false Apostles
[1:02:46] are Grievous wolves that Paul spoke of
[1:02:49] once I'm going to uh I am gone once I am
[1:02:53] gone they will try to come and claim
[1:02:56] equal Revelation but their purpose is
[1:02:59] not to help you but to destroy
[1:03:02] you then he quotes Acts 20 for I know
[1:03:06] this that after my departing shall
[1:03:07] Grievious wolves enter in among you not
[1:03:10] sparing the flock also of your own
[1:03:12] selves men shall arise speaking perverse
[1:03:14] things their own words and ideas not
[1:03:16] Gods to draw away disciples after them
[1:03:20] therefore watch and remember that by the
[1:03:22] space of three years I cease not to warn
[1:03:24] every one of you day and night with with
[1:03:26] tears paragraph 95 Ephesian Church age
[1:03:29] now Paul was a prophet taught by the
[1:03:31] Holy Ghost if Paul baptized in the name
[1:03:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ said anyone
[1:03:37] that said that did different from his
[1:03:39] preaching was a cursed then it is a time
[1:03:42] to wake up and see that the church is no
[1:03:44] longer in controlled by the Holy Ghost
[1:03:47] but controlled by
[1:03:48] nickan anybody know what a nickan spirit
[1:03:52] is to conquer the leoty you think God's
[1:03:55] going to let you stay as one happy
[1:04:00] family they going to send in Devils
[1:04:02] among you like I had a cartoon p uh
[1:04:06] character one time they showed a big
[1:04:09] devil behind a desk and all these little
[1:04:11] Devils out there in front of him he had
[1:04:13] his finger up like this and a little
[1:04:15] caption below it says and remember this
[1:04:17] quote lots of
[1:04:21] scripture because will not Satan's
[1:04:24] Messengers transform themselves into
[1:04:29] angels of light oh I'm a message
[1:04:32] believer I'm a message
[1:04:49] preacher God's spirit brings unity and
[1:04:52] Harmony within the body of Christ amen
[1:04:56] this message has brought a Unity to the
[1:04:58] Bride of Jesus Christ we are one
[1:05:03] body we are baptized into one
[1:05:06] spirit is that right now the devil don't
[1:05:09] want you to stay one body because a
[1:05:11] nickan spirit is going to come in there
[1:05:13] and Conquer and one of the spirits that
[1:05:16] is an antichrist spirit is to
[1:05:20] divide and
[1:05:22] conquer so when you see that this little
[1:05:25] group comes up and they got some
[1:05:27] exclusive Revelation you're not a part
[1:05:29] of it you're not going to be in the
[1:05:30] bride you have to believe this ministry
[1:05:32] you have to believe this or that what is
[1:05:35] it doing it's dividing the body and
[1:05:38] every one of these isms that have come
[1:05:40] within the message we'll talk about that
[1:05:42] we'll elaborate on this but every one of
[1:05:45] them pulled off disciples after
[1:05:50] themselves they're still doing it today
[1:05:53] right
[1:05:59] Satan will not let you stay one happy
[1:06:03] family I printed this out I didn't give
[1:06:05] this out to the Brethren so don't try to
[1:06:07] find it brother Yesa because I'm just
[1:06:09] reading it this
[1:06:11] is
[1:06:13] um one where brother Ram says a word to
[1:06:16] the church he said love one another but
[1:06:20] now let me give you my warning Satan
[1:06:22] won't let you stay that way no sir he'll
[1:06:23] shoot everything if he has to bring in
[1:06:26] somebody and make him his Target he'll
[1:06:29] bring some critic unbeliever sit down
[1:06:31] and cause him to fellow fellowship with
[1:06:34] you under the quiet and things and then
[1:06:36] he'll shoot that guy full of some kind
[1:06:39] of poison and stuff he'll start through
[1:06:40] the church with it don't you take sides
[1:06:44] with it don't you have nothing to do
[1:06:45] with it you stay right loving sweet and
[1:06:48] kind to one
[1:06:49] another stay with your pastor he's
[1:06:51] ordained of
[1:06:53] God the enemy will come
[1:06:56] that devil is using an enemy will either
[1:06:59] get out or come in and be one of you
[1:07:02] that's right don't ever become clannish
[1:07:04] don't make yourself
[1:07:10] clannish that's
[1:07:13] happening now we've got tapes on
[1:07:16] that he says you got tapes on discipline
[1:07:19] in the church how you be behave yourself
[1:07:22] in the Church of God how we got to come
[1:07:25] here to get together sit together in
[1:07:26] Heavenly places whatever you do don't
[1:07:29] stay
[1:07:32] home that's a problem today we got a lot
[1:07:35] of people home
[1:07:38] churching don't have to come subject to
[1:07:40] nobody just stay home and uh you become
[1:07:43] your own Pastor next thing you know
[1:07:47] there's you have denominated don't take
[1:07:49] a preacher to make a denomination just
[1:07:53] takes one with his own own ideas
[1:07:56] contrary to the prophet of God brother
[1:07:59] Brandon will the bride of Christ listen
[1:08:02] to me now will the bride of Christ have
[1:08:04] a Ministry before the coming of the Lord
[1:08:07] yeah sure uhhuh what is it it's
[1:08:09] Ephesians 4 Apostles prophets evangelist
[1:08:13] pastors teachers so anybody tells you to
[1:08:16] just stay home and press
[1:08:20] play it's already it's wrong
[1:08:26] because he'll deny he'll just let you
[1:08:28] have a four a onefold Ministry not
[1:08:31] five-fold just the prophet well let me
[1:08:34] tell you that Prophet said there's a
[1:08:36] five-fold Ministry there's Apostles
[1:08:39] prophets evangelists pastors and
[1:08:41] teachers whatever you do don't stay
[1:08:44] home and Co just went ahead and made an
[1:08:48] excuse for many people to work from home
[1:08:53] Church from home that's
[1:08:56] true and just live
[1:08:58] stream I streaming is okay it's a
[1:09:03] substitute but there ain't nothing like
[1:09:05] being in church sitting under a live
[1:09:08] Ministry with a minister that's that's
[1:09:10] hearing from God and got something on
[1:09:12] his heart next thing you know he's
[1:09:14] Discerning your heart and he's casting a
[1:09:16] spirit off of you and you didn't even
[1:09:18] know you you had one on you
[1:09:28] so next thing you know you'll think a
[1:09:30] little wrong your brother or sister let
[1:09:32] me tell you get out that root of
[1:09:34] bitterness don't ever have a root of
[1:09:36] bitterness among
[1:09:37] you used to be years ago it's pretty
[1:09:41] naive as young man in this message you'd
[1:09:42] come go to a convention and you'd travel
[1:09:45] halfway across America to go to a
[1:09:47] convention there' be churches in
[1:09:49] different ministers and hey we're all
[1:09:50] together this one big happy family
[1:09:53] within just a year or two this one's
[1:09:55] split from that one that one split from
[1:09:57] this one and they're shooting at one
[1:09:59] brother Brenham said hey the Bride of
[1:10:01] Jesus Christ is one amen and he said
[1:10:06] bride will not persecute
[1:10:11] bride he said the devil he says has got
[1:10:14] you shooting at one another he don't
[1:10:16] even have
[1:10:17] to come against you why you're just
[1:10:20] shooting at one
[1:10:21] another God help us
[1:10:25] I'm not asking everybody to agree with
[1:10:28] me I'm just asking you to agree with the
[1:10:33] word
[1:10:39] amen let me show you say you want to
[1:10:41] find it in scripture I'll show
[1:10:44] you you want to see how a nickan spirit
[1:10:47] comes in 1 Corinthians chap 1: 10-15 now
[1:10:52] I beseech you Brethren by the name of
[1:10:53] our Lord Jesus Christ you all speak the
[1:10:55] same
[1:10:56] thing that there be no divisions among
[1:10:59] you that you be perfectly joined
[1:11:01] together in the same mind same
[1:11:04] judgment for it hath been declared unto
[1:11:06] me of my brethren by them which are of
[1:11:09] the House of Khloe that there are
[1:11:11] contentions among you this is a first
[1:11:14] church first church age now this I say
[1:11:17] that every one of you saith I'm of Paul
[1:11:21] I'm of Apollos I'm of sephus and I of
[1:11:24] Christ is Christ
[1:11:26] divided was Paul Paul crucified for you
[1:11:30] were you baptized in the name of Paul I
[1:11:33] thank God I baptize none of you but
[1:11:36] Chrismas and gaas lest any should say I
[1:11:39] baptize you in my own
[1:11:42] name happening in every Church age it's
[1:11:45] happening in this age
[1:11:47] too spiritual
[1:11:50] immaturity you're no longer
[1:11:53] babes having a sincere milk of the word
[1:11:56] but you're spiritual adults able to take
[1:11:59] strong meat this is strong
[1:12:02] meat if you're one of these that's just
[1:12:04] on the sincere milk of the word you may
[1:12:07] gag at some of
[1:12:11] this well just spit it out and wait a
[1:12:14] little bit later till you get some of
[1:12:17] these then you start chewing on it
[1:12:22] amen I'm of Paul and I of apost
[1:12:28] us I pray
[1:12:30] that you will become mature adults in
[1:12:33] Christ watch what 1 Corinthians 3 verses
[1:12:37] 1-4 and Brethren I could not speak unto
[1:12:40] you as
[1:12:42] spiritual but as un carnal even as babes
[1:12:46] in Christ I have fed you with milk and
[1:12:49] not with meat for hither to you were not
[1:12:51] able to Bear it neither yet are you able
[1:12:55] for ye are yet
[1:12:57] carnal for whereas there is among you
[1:13:00] envyings and strife and divisions are
[1:13:03] you not carnal and walk as men for while
[1:13:06] one saith I'm of Paul and another I am
[1:13:08] of Apollos are you not
[1:13:12] carnal

[1:13:38] you that you should not obey the
[1:13:43] truth oh my now let me just go over a
[1:13:48] couple of these things that have caused
[1:13:50] divisions among the body of Christ and
[1:13:53] if you haven't
[1:13:56] seen or been affected by one or more of
[1:13:59] these doctrines you will be just hang

[1:18:18] rough I told him I said brother you're
[1:18:20] going to have to go somewhere
[1:18:22] else because I can't have you I said
[1:18:24] said you don't even recognize the spirit
[1:18:26] that you're packing and everything and I
[1:18:29] had a a young brother who came to me and
[1:18:31] he withstood me and I was his Pastor I
[1:18:34] don't think it's right brother Ron
[1:18:36] people's past and the things that they
[1:18:38] do and everything and everything what
[1:18:39] about the blood of Jesus I said I
[1:18:42] understand blood of Jesus Christ
[1:18:43] cleanses a man from all sin but I said
[1:18:46] he's he's not even admitting
[1:18:49] guilt so this brother he withstood me
[1:18:53] and he he said and and go you know God
[1:18:55] blessed this young brother because he
[1:18:57] always stood for the underdog be careful
[1:19:00] who you choose sides with he felt well
[1:19:02] there's nobody here on this brother's
[1:19:04] side and he's such a humble brother next
[1:19:06] thing you know um I had told this
[1:19:09] brother I said please I'm going to ask
[1:19:11] you I had him sign the letter please
[1:19:13] don't come to church any
[1:19:15] longer about three days later he
[1:19:18] died the young brother in my church
[1:19:21] still going to my church said hey
[1:19:23] there's nobody to take up a an offering
[1:19:26] to bury him he's got no family no NEX of
[1:19:28] kin he's just a ward of the
[1:19:32] state he came to your church Ron why
[1:19:34] don't you take up an offering bury him
[1:19:36] let's have a memorial service I said no
[1:19:41] I said just like ananas and saf you
[1:19:44] remember he said Hey listen to the
[1:19:46] footsteps of those that went and buried
[1:19:47] your husband they're coming to get you
[1:19:50] now and she gave up the ghost huh we
[1:19:52] we're talking about the Gospel of Jesus
[1:19:54] Christ
[1:19:55] Christ and he was the loudest Shou us
[1:19:58] one that we
[1:20:00] had now be
[1:20:02] careful sometimes they put a mask
[1:20:05] on of having a form of godliness but
[1:20:10] denying the power of
[1:20:13] thereof how about just five-fold
[1:20:16] Ministry only you don't even have to
[1:20:18] listen to the tapes cuz a fivefold
[1:20:20] Ministry will'll tell you what the
[1:20:21] prophet of God said you don't got to
[1:20:23] listen I'll tell you just pay me and
[1:20:25] I'll tell you no
[1:20:27] way
[1:20:28] no because there's a balance between the
[1:20:31] tapes and the fivefold ministry somebody
[1:20:34] say Amen on
[1:20:37] that then it split up fivefold
[1:20:42] ministry and them going to church and
[1:20:45] then a group makes themselves tapes only
[1:20:47] and yet they still go to church you ever
[1:20:50] any of you know of a tapes only church
[1:20:52] where they just go hey you come here and
[1:20:53] guess what we don't have a pastor we
[1:20:55] just uh brother brenham's our pastor and
[1:20:58] on and on and so we'll just play a
[1:21:01] tape they believed in going to church
[1:21:04] until evolution of time until they don't
[1:21:07] go to church anymore they just stay home
[1:21:10] and play a tape I want you to see how
[1:21:14] divisions come in among the church and
[1:21:16] next thing you know and look so
[1:21:18] innocent I could ask any of you do you
[1:21:21] know anybody that's been in these
[1:21:23] movements do you know anybody that split
[1:21:25] up or disfellowshipped with you because
[1:21:29] you didn't agree with the way they were
[1:21:36] going how about return
[1:21:39] Ministry brother Ram's going to come
[1:21:41] back and when he does he's going to

[1:23:41] sit on what position in the
[1:23:44] airplane now I know saints of God and I
[1:23:47] know that some of this is a little bit
[1:23:49] hard to
[1:23:50] hear because really you know what it has
[1:23:55] divided the body of
[1:23:57] Christ so many times and what happens
[1:24:00] with people when they follow one of
[1:24:02] these de exclusive Revelation Ministries
[1:24:07] and they go for so long and just like a
[1:24:09] wave I'm a surfer man you guys know what
[1:24:11] it's like to take off on a big wave and
[1:24:13] you got all the power and you stroke off
[1:24:16] into that wave and as soon as the
[1:24:17] surfboard catches the momentum or the
[1:24:20] power of that wave you take off come
[1:24:22] down to the face of that wave you make
[1:24:24] turn and guess what woo yeah wow me CU
[1:24:28] you got power with it but what happens
[1:24:31] to the wave you ride it and it keeps
[1:24:32] going and it goes further and closer to
[1:24:34] Shore and that big old wave what does it
[1:24:36] do it just it's losing its power until
[1:24:39] funny comes up and it goes right up onto
[1:24:41] the shore and goes onto your little
[1:24:44] toes and then it recedes back well
[1:24:48] that's what's happening with a lot of
[1:24:49] these movements a big powerful movement
[1:24:52] big wave yeah but then you just keep
[1:24:55] writing and writing and H and pretty
[1:24:58] soon it's just a little trickle but then
[1:25:01] watch there's coming another one
[1:25:03] somebody else going to rise up with
[1:25:05] something
[1:25:08] else so you got the the one now press
[1:25:11] play it's happening and affecting
[1:25:15] churches All Over America and Africa
[1:25:17] right now is really affecting them just
[1:25:21] press play and Obey stay home
[1:25:27] can you
[1:25:29] imagine the Bible says forsake not the
[1:25:32] assembling
[1:25:33] together and yet you're going to let me
[1:25:36] ask you a
[1:25:37] question from Genesis to Revelation did
[1:25:40] God ever used the son of a major
[1:25:49] prophet God never did never
[1:25:53] will I'm sorry I don't follow the
[1:25:57] brandom family I follow the
[1:26:01] message fact when Brother Joseph and
[1:26:05] I withstood one another on
[1:26:09] the the ability
[1:26:12] to copyright the
[1:26:15] message I said how can you copyright
[1:26:19] what is God's I said if this was your
[1:26:22] daddy's message you copy it but don't I
[1:26:24] said you you better change the name it
[1:26:27] ain't voice of God it's a voice of
[1:26:28] William brandom and you can have every
[1:26:31] royalty and you can make money and you
[1:26:34] can sell every book and every tape and
[1:26:36] you can make money because it was
[1:26:37] William brandom's
[1:26:39] message brother R said I ain't got no
[1:26:41] more to do with this message than
[1:26:43] nothing against my own better judgment I
[1:26:46] want to go up and be a Trapper why he
[1:26:48] got to see all the
[1:26:51] nonsense people baptizing in his name
[1:26:54] people thinking he's Jesus Christ he
[1:26:56] said why he says uh I I thought it was a
[1:27:00] joke until I found out it was some of my
[1:27:03] best
[1:27:04] friends oh we know who you are William
[1:27:08] brandom it's God manifested In the Flesh
[1:27:12] here it is mdcs come down and the next
[1:27:15] thing you know what you do you take it
[1:27:17] too far next thing you know you've made
[1:27:18] brother Brenham
[1:27:20] God you know baptize in his name guess
[1:27:23] what the new name is written on the
[1:27:26] stone William
[1:27:30] brandom wow yeah so let's get baptized
[1:27:33] in brother br's name and it's pulled
[1:27:35] people off well what happens after this
[1:27:38] whole wave finally just go where where
[1:27:40] do those people wind
[1:27:44] up hitting the
[1:27:46] ditch that's why this is why I'm trying
[1:27:48] to preach it to you straight this is why
[1:27:52] saints of God
[1:27:54] you better thank God that you have a
[1:27:56] minister that's not appear here to just
[1:27:58] tickle your ears I'm going to go show
[1:28:00] you some things here because brother brm
[1:28:02] said this is a prophecy now I'm going to
[1:28:05] show you some stuff
[1:28:08] here in the seventh
[1:28:10] seal 1963 brother BR picks it up I've
[1:28:15] held that word look at every Vision
[1:28:17] everywhere the day I laid that
[1:28:19] Cornerstone Yonder I put that in there
[1:28:22] wrote on there what he showed me that
[1:28:24] morning in a vision that morning in a
[1:28:28] vision be instant in season out of
[1:28:31] season Reb
[1:28:34] rebuke with all longsuffering and
[1:28:37] Doctrine for the time will come when
[1:28:39] they will not endure sound Doctrine but
[1:28:43] after their own
[1:28:44] lust shall Heap up for themselves to uh
[1:28:49] together teachers having itching ears
[1:28:51] and not and be turned away from the
[1:28:54] truth unto fables that's the seventh
[1:28:56] seal 3 months later he preaches flashing
[1:28:59] red light of the sign of his coming but
[1:29:02] today they don't want to hear a message
[1:29:04] like that people don't want to hear that
[1:29:07] they want to be tickled in their ears
[1:29:09] exactly what the here Holy Spirit told
[1:29:11] me that the day I laid the Cornerstone
[1:29:14] in there to preach the word be instant
[1:29:16] in season out of season for the time
[1:29:19] will come when they will no longer
[1:29:20] endure sound Doctrine but after their
[1:29:22] own lust shall Heap for themselves
[1:29:25] together teachers having itching they
[1:29:27] shall be turned to
[1:29:29] fables that's exactly what it's turned
[1:29:32] to be see the time will come when
[1:29:34] they'll no longer endure sound Doctrine
[1:29:38] it's time to discern
[1:29:41] Spirits try the spirits see that if they
[1:29:44] be of
[1:29:47] God God does not hand down spiritual
[1:29:51] lineage excuse me spiritual gifting by
[1:29:54] physical lineage never did use the son
[1:29:58] of a major prophet never he's the same
[1:30:01] yesterday today and forever from Genesis
[1:30:04] Revelation amen the closest thing we
[1:30:07] have to that are are the sons of Eli and
[1:30:09] the sons of
[1:30:11] Samuel and the people came to Samuel and
[1:30:14] said thy Sons no longer walk in the ways
[1:30:17] of thy
[1:30:22] father I'm shock you for a
[1:30:30] moment the most brokeup family right now
[1:30:34] divided within the whole message is the
[1:30:37] brandom
[1:30:39] family wake up and smell the coffee and
[1:30:42] if you don't believe me go ask some of
[1:30:46] the brandom's do they all go to
[1:30:52] church what about Joseph's own son Isaac
[1:30:55] what about him does he go to church what
[1:30:57] about the grandkids where are they are
[1:30:59] they all going to the
[1:31:01] Tabernacle are they all staying home and
[1:31:03] pressing
[1:31:04] play it's so broke up and divided and
[1:31:07] I'm sorry that's a shocker to a lot of
[1:31:10] you but I don't use the brandom family
[1:31:13] as my measuring
[1:31:18] post
[1:31:22] amen God never did he the son of a major
[1:31:25] prophet that's why when I went to work
[1:31:27] for Brother Joseph I told him I said I
[1:31:30] got more scripture against you that
[1:31:33] you'll go wrong then you'll go right I
[1:31:35] said but nevertheless I said I'm working
[1:31:37] for
[1:31:38] you I said so you just tell me what you
[1:31:41] want done and I and so for there in
[1:31:44] Europe for about three and a half years
[1:31:46] we ran the only voice of God office
[1:31:48] outside of Jeffersonville anywhere in
[1:31:50] the world first one Joseph inherited a
[1:31:53] work we were already doing and brother
[1:31:55] Mike it was your your brother brother
[1:31:58] Floyd that sent us because Brother Floyd

[1:32:12] brother Ram you remember the old spoken
[1:32:14] word books with the eagle on the
[1:32:18] back used to be that that's where you if
[1:32:21] you wanted to get books you had to go to
[1:32:23] spoken word brother Roy borders well
[1:32:25] brother Roy borders got sick and he was
[1:32:27] dying he told Brother Floyd you become
[1:32:30] publisher Brother Floyd took it over
[1:32:33] about a year and a half into it and
[1:32:35] Brother Floyd did ask us to go to Europe
[1:32:37] so my wife and I packed it up how old
[1:32:39] was I when I moved to Europe
[1:32:42] Sandra

[1:32:47] kid 32 years of age go over there with
[1:32:50] three of my kids

[1:32:56] $750 $700 a month living in
[1:33:00] Europe then Joseph brandham comes along
[1:33:03] year and a half later he wants to take
[1:33:06] it from Brother Floyd Brother Floyd said
[1:33:07] no I won't do it Joseph went to Billy
[1:33:11] Paul and said I want to start my own
[1:33:12] publishing
[1:33:15] company and brother Billy Paul wrote a
[1:33:17] check that day for $60,000 to buy the
[1:33:20] first web press when Brother Floyd found
[1:33:23] out about it he said I'm not going to
[1:33:26] fight the brandom family for for for
[1:33:28] this he turned it over to Brother Joseph
[1:33:30] Brother Joseph took it changed the name
[1:33:32] voice of God
[1:33:34] recording fine so he inherited he and
[1:33:37] brother Billy Paul came over to Europe
[1:33:39] said brother Ron will you continue on
[1:33:41] doing this because what I'll do is I'll
[1:33:43] send another brother from Jeffersonville
[1:33:46] he'll take over if you can go another
[1:33:48] six months I said fine six months turned
[1:33:50] to three and a half years until finally
[1:33:56] and I'm going to be just so honest with
[1:33:59] you
[1:34:01] guys I was on the inside of the
[1:34:05] inside close to the
[1:34:07] family voice of
[1:34:10] God and I saw and heard things that
[1:34:14] troubl me so bad I said father let me
[1:34:17] out before I backslide
[1:34:24] because all it takes is a little bit of
[1:34:26] time you be with somebody and next thing
[1:34:28] you know they call this the
[1:34:36] message brother Paul we were
[1:34:38] fellowshipping the other day you're a
[1:34:40] young boy about 18 years of age you go
[1:34:42] to Europe you're you're you're
[1:34:44] fellowshipping with the young kids the
[1:34:46] pastor's kids and stuff these are kids
[1:34:48] in Europe back when you was just young
[1:34:50] boy and you go out to dinner and
[1:34:52] fellowship with these kids and they're
[1:34:53] drinking
[1:34:54] alcohol and you're going
[1:34:58] whoa is that right brother
[1:35:03] Paul I said oh God because I've never
[1:35:06] doubted this
[1:35:08] message because this message is
[1:35:11] Christ I've never been offended by
[1:35:14] anything what brother BR said oh there's
[1:35:16] been some things that has cut me to the
[1:35:18] Bone and everything but I've said yay
[1:35:20] and amen I said yes Lord I have never
[1:35:23] ever this message has never offended
[1:35:28] me but the
[1:35:29] Believers within
[1:35:31] it
[1:35:34] h I tell you what that's why some of the
[1:35:38] young people look at the people within
[1:35:42] the message and say if that's the
[1:35:44] message I want nothing to do with it but
[1:35:47] you know
[1:35:48] what it's happened with Jesus
[1:35:52] Christ you had all kinds of different
[1:35:54] ones that after he left guess what hus
[1:35:58] and philetus pull away disciples after
[1:36:01] themselves making the the faith of some

[1:38:03] we baptize you in water you turn back uh
[1:38:06] right back around young man right there

[1:38:22] tomorrow you're a manifested Son of God
[1:38:26] nonsense where do you get that in the
[1:38:29] word babies are not born men they're
[1:38:31] born babies and grow to
[1:38:38] man you know what a baby has natural
[1:38:41] discernment and it uses the
[1:38:44] five physical senses C taste smell feeli
[1:38:47] here and everything that baby wants to
[1:38:51] relate to himself he's got to touch it
[1:38:54] smell it feel it whatever huh he finds
[1:38:57] his foot guess what he
[1:38:59] does he's got to taste his foot he got
[1:39:02] to taste his hand everything you put
[1:39:04] anything in front of him he grabs it he
[1:39:07] oh glasses I
[1:39:10] wonder you see what he's doing trying to
[1:39:12] because he's trying to discern but now
[1:39:16] listen we're not talking about physical
[1:39:18] discernment now I'm talking about
[1:39:20] spiritual discernment and all of you
[1:39:21] have got to have spiritual discernment I
[1:39:23] don't want you immature babies I don't
[1:39:26] want you to be so innocent and naive to
[1:39:28] think that that everybody that claims to
[1:39:31] believe this message really believes it
[1:39:33] because the Apostle Paul told the people
[1:39:35] he says a real true Jew is one who's won
[1:39:44] inwardly oh even Peter had
[1:39:47] to be rebuked by Paul and he said here
[1:39:51] Peter you're trying to make all these
[1:39:53] genes Jews you're trying to get them
[1:39:57] circumcised had to withstand him to his
[1:39:59] face okay we're talking about when the
[1:40:01] true church gets a true Revelation okay
[1:40:04] these things are happening here Among
[1:40:07] Us it's divided it's split this group
[1:40:10] and you know what you watch when
[1:40:13] something like that comes in and divides
[1:40:15] a group you'll not they'll not have
[1:40:18] fellowship with you anymore they can
[1:40:21] leave your church and you can have a big
[1:40:24] convention they'll never darken your
[1:40:26] door again why what
[1:40:29] happened what what
[1:40:34] happened used to be you could yeah hey
[1:40:37] man
[1:40:40] people I'm just talking about you watch
[1:40:43] you take a
[1:40:44] spirit you can go I've been in Costco
[1:40:49] I've been in Kmart I've been shopping
[1:40:53] I'm all a sudden see Believers and they
[1:40:54] see you and
[1:40:59] go so I head them off at the pass and
[1:41:01] come to the
[1:41:04] hey and all of a sudden they're speaking
[1:41:06] in
[1:41:09] tongues because you know what we're
[1:41:13] brothers yeah you might see it
[1:41:15] differently than me but why why does
[1:41:17] that got to cause us to be
[1:41:21] divided why can't we
[1:41:23] and brother Brenham said one says he's
[1:41:26] coming on a white horse another says
[1:41:28] he's coming on a white cloud so what
[1:41:31] what difference does it make as long as
[1:41:34] we agree he's
[1:41:39] coming five physical senses to discern
[1:41:43] the worldly realm around you but there's
[1:41:45] a six sense given to every SE Gene that
[1:41:48] is called the gift of faith and fath of
[1:41:50] Revelation brother renom calls it the
[1:41:52] super sense
[1:41:57] sheep that tend to wander off needs
[1:41:59] constant eye of the
[1:42:01] shepherd a child that lacks natural
[1:42:05] discernment and Common Sense will need
[1:42:07] the parents constant
[1:42:10] attention where were you last
[1:42:13] night well I was just out I know you
[1:42:15] just
[1:42:21] out when a church remember lacks of
[1:42:24] discernment it's constantly needing to
[1:42:27] be rescued From The Snare of the enemy
[1:42:30] because you go out and you do things
[1:42:31] wrong say things wrong and get a wrong
[1:42:34] among the wrong company next thing you
[1:42:36] know you taking a
[1:42:38] spirit because birds of a
[1:42:44] feather
[1:42:47] yeah now let me show you a scriptural
[1:42:50] example we're talking about the book of
[1:42:51] Acts huh we're talking about oh hey how
[1:42:55] about that book of Acts how about the
[1:42:57] acts of the Holy Spirit man that came in
[1:43:00] there day of Pentecost Acts chapter 2
[1:43:02] man came down they all began to speak
[1:43:05] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[1:43:07] them utterance and there was one big
[1:43:09] happy family but just give them a few
[1:43:12] years watch if you want to turn with me
[1:43:16] let's go to Acts chapter8
[1:43:23] now I'm going to show you the difference
[1:43:25] between two
[1:43:27] elders and a
[1:43:30] young Minister a deacon called
[1:43:33] Phillip all right we're going to
[1:43:38] look Philip went down to the city of
[1:43:40] Samaria and preached Christ unto
[1:43:43] them acts 8 ver 5-2 and the people with
[1:43:46] one Accord gave heed on all these things
[1:43:48] which Philip spake hearing and seeing
[1:43:51] the Miracles which he did Spirits crying
[1:43:54] with a loud voice come out of many that
[1:43:57] were possessed with them and many taken
[1:44:00] with PES and that were lame were healed
[1:44:03] there was great joy in that City but
[1:44:05] there was a certain man called Simon
[1:44:08] which Before Time in the same city used
[1:44:11] sorcery Bewitched the people of Samaria
[1:44:14] giving out that himself was some great
[1:44:19] one to whom they all had give heed from
[1:44:22] the least to the greatest saying this
[1:44:24] man is the great power of God and to him
[1:44:28] they had regard because of a long time
[1:44:30] he had Bewitched them with
[1:44:34] sorceries and when they believed Phillip
[1:44:37] preaching the things concerning the
[1:44:40] kingdom of God and the name of Jesus
[1:44:42] Christ they were baptized both men and
[1:44:44] women then Simon
[1:44:47] himself
[1:44:49] wow Hallelujah philli gets there they
[1:44:53] got a little Revival and Simon Says man
[1:44:56] this is amazing so Simon believes also
[1:45:00] Hallelujah put it in our magazine send
[1:45:04] it out around the world
[1:45:06] Simon got converted watch
[1:45:12] this Simon himself believed also and
[1:45:15] when he was baptized he continued with
[1:45:17] Phillip my they were having a message
[1:45:20] Revival and wanded beholding the miracle
[1:45:23] the signs which were done now when the
[1:45:25] apostles which were in Jerusalem heard
[1:45:28] that Samaria had received the word of
[1:45:29] God they said to them Peter and John hey
[1:45:31] go check it out
[1:45:33] boys yeah go see if this is real who
[1:45:36] when they were come down prayed for them
[1:45:38] that they might receive the Holy Ghost
[1:45:39] for as yet he was swen on none of them
[1:45:43] only they were baptized in the name of
[1:45:45] the Lord
[1:45:46] Jesus then laid they hands on them and
[1:45:49] they received the Holy Ghost when Simon
[1:45:51] saw that through the laying on in the
[1:45:53] apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given
[1:45:56] he offered them
[1:45:58] money well they said oh wow this a
[1:46:00] greatest Vindication of my Ministry yes

[1:46:05] this power and you
[1:46:08] can saying give me also this power that
[1:46:12] whomsoever I lay hands on he may receive
[1:46:14] the Holy
[1:46:15] Ghost Peter said unto him watch now
[1:46:18] here's an
[1:46:19] elder thy money perish with thee because
[1:46:22] thou H has thought that the gift of God
[1:46:24] may be purchased with
[1:46:26] money thou Hast neither part nor lot in
[1:46:29] the matter for thy heart is not right in
[1:46:31] the sight of
[1:46:33] God repent therefore of thy wickedness

[1:46:38] thine heart may be forgiven thee for I

[1:47:01] Simon I perceive that thou art in the G
[1:47:04] of
[1:47:05] bitterness and in the bond of
[1:47:10] iniquity then answered Simon

[1:47:17] of these things that you have spoken
[1:47:18] come unto me and they when they had
[1:47:22] testified and preached the word of the
[1:47:25] Lord returned under Jerusalem and
[1:47:27] preached the gospel in many villages
[1:47:29] under the Samaritans it took seasoned
[1:47:33] Elders you understand that to discern a
[1:47:38] spirit on Simon Philip missed
[1:47:42] it he looked at just the outward
[1:47:45] manifestation he came into the message

[1:50:31] grieved turned and said to the spirit I
[1:50:34] command thee in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:50:36] to come out of her and he came out the
[1:50:39] same
[1:50:42] hour look at
[1:50:44] that what she was saying was right but
[1:50:49] it was a spirit it was an ungodly spirit
[1:50:52] Spirit of divination that's what sent
[1:50:55] those guys to
[1:50:57] prison was because those that said hey
[1:50:59] these men come and trouble Jerusalem and
[1:51:01] try to do this and that they you know

[1:51:49] houses and Lead captive silly women
[1:51:51] Laden with sins LED away with divers
[1:51:55] lust ever learning never able to come to
[1:51:57] the knowledge of the
[1:51:58] truth now as Janice and jambre withstood
[1:52:01] Moses so do these resist the truth men
[1:52:04] of corrupt Minds rep probate concerning
[1:52:06] the faith they shall proceed no further
[1:52:09] their Folly shall be made manifest unto
[1:52:11] all men as theirs was verse 12 yay and
[1:52:15] all that live Godly in Christ Jesus
[1:52:17] shall suffer persecution but evil men
[1:52:20] and seducers will wax worse and worse
[1:52:22] deceive deing and being
[1:52:25] deceived what does it mean to be
[1:52:27] spiritually
[1:52:29] Discerning you ought to be able to to
[1:52:32] have a discernment of something inside
[1:52:34] of you to know if it's right or
[1:52:46] wrong you see the bride of Christ must
[1:52:49] not only have spiritual revelation
[1:52:52] but spiritual
[1:53:01] discernment so she'll not be
[1:53:04] deceived pray for spiritual discernment
[1:53:07] and
[1:53:09] understanding amen let me show you he
[1:53:13] cares do you care we got two churches at
[1:53:17] hand this morning one of them is the
[1:53:18] Church of Pentecost organized at
[1:53:21] Pentecost by the Holy Spirit the second
[1:53:24] is the Church of the Roman Catholic
[1:53:27] which is organized in N of Rome one of
[1:53:29] them is a spiritual birth the other
[1:53:30] one's an intellectual
[1:53:33] membership I'm going to go to the bottom
[1:53:36] here one is based on spiritual
[1:53:38] discernment the other one is based on
[1:53:40] educational intellectual
[1:53:44] conception brother Brenham taught
[1:53:46] sermons such as Jezebel
[1:53:49] religion Blasphemous names
[1:53:56] he said denominational Spirits are
[1:53:58] seducing Spirits enticing Spirits
[1:54:00] unclean ungodly lascivious
[1:54:05] sensual remember a religious spirit is a
[1:54:07] sexual
[1:54:08] Spirit that's why when you get off the
[1:54:11] word of God and you take a spirit of
[1:54:14] spiritual fornication it'll wind up in
[1:54:18] physical
[1:54:20] fornication that's why a lot of these
[1:54:22] min
[1:54:23] in their lives they went along very good
[1:54:26] for so long next thing you know what's
[1:54:28] happened to
[1:54:34] them not a lot of people shouting
[1:54:37] hallelujah amen on that but it's true
[1:54:47] amen demonology
[1:54:52] many of you were in some sort of
[1:54:54] denominational Christianity before you
[1:54:56] came to the message but when you heard
[1:54:58] the message was clear and precise come
[1:54:59] out from
[1:55:01] among God quickening your spiritual
[1:55:04] discernment you did not understand it
[1:55:07] all at the beginning but you were
[1:55:08] learning and Desiring for more of Truth
[1:55:10] and then many of you tried to fellowship
[1:55:12] with people from denominations after you
[1:55:14] came to the message and found it
[1:55:16] immediately it don't
[1:55:21] work different spirit so you better
[1:55:29] discern
[1:55:32] amen Samaran Church age brother R said
[1:55:36] The more associate the mere Association
[1:55:38] of kind-hearted people with True

[1:56:09] misconstrue misplace the word they'll
[1:56:11] put their own opinion to it and that's
[1:56:15] what makes them deceivers now watch this

[1:57:38] one of the longest sermons brother
[1:57:40] Brenham ever preaches is spoken word is
[1:57:42] the original
[1:57:49] seat paragraph 47
[1:57:53] talking about deception it didn't come
[1:57:55] through Adam shame on you who don't see
[1:57:58] that see it's not Adam's fault he had
[1:58:01] nothing to do with if death come by Adam
[1:58:03] see then it come by God death come by
[1:58:08] crossbreeding death can't come by God's
[1:58:11] word death comes by crossbreeding it to
[1:58:14] denomination Creed instead of Christ
[1:58:16] Dogma instead of the word it doesn't
[1:58:19] come by the word the word is life amen
[1:58:22] to crossbreed it there's where death
[1:58:26] comes
[1:58:27] from Adam was not deceived paragraph 50
[1:58:31] but his bride was
[1:58:33] deceived Christ today is not deceived
[1:58:37] the word is not deceiving it's the
[1:58:45] bride it's the bride doing
[1:58:48] deceiving by the word and watch it's by
[1:58:50] their interpretation of the word
[1:58:53] you see that this pretty heavy to take
[1:58:57] who's doing the
[1:59:02] deceiving watch this let's keep
[1:59:05] reading paragraph 67 and Adam's bride
[1:59:08] could not wait she went forward first
[1:59:11] that's the way today the bride
[1:59:13] today she wants to manufacture something

[1:59:18] the platform she's got to have
[1:59:20] everything see what she doing

[1:59:46] want some kind of phony makeup with
[1:59:48] screaming and jumping and speaking in
[1:59:50] tongues or something instead of waiting
[1:59:52] waiting for the real word of God to be
[1:59:54] manifested through his bride them kind
[1:59:57] takes the word of God it's God's true
[1:59:59] bride bringing forth children see a
