[10:41] Amen. God is good this morning. Brother
[10:44] Ben and Sister Megan, I want to wish
[10:47] Josiah a happy third birthday. Brother
[10:50] Ben sent me a text. He says, "We're so
[10:52] thankful for God's hand in Josiah's life
[10:54] and the blessing and joy that he brings
[10:56] to us. Just so thankful for what the
[10:58] Lord has done in little Josiah's life.
[10:59] Pray the Lord just continue to
[11:01] overshadow him and help him on his
[11:05] journey." Amen. God is good. Sister
[11:08] Nancy Tim P is
[11:11] has several preliminary appointments
[11:12] this week leading up to her infusion one
[11:15] week from tomorrow. Please pray that
[11:17] everything stays on track. Then she will
[11:19] make minim she will have minimal side
[11:21] effects after the infusion. So let's
[11:23] remember sister Nancy. Pray the Lord
[11:25] continue to be with her.
[11:28] Sister Josie Robas is asking prayer for
[11:30] her brother Arthur Arthur Banks. He's in
[11:33] hospice. So let's remember sister
[11:35] Josie's brother Arthur.
[11:38] Sister Charity Walter says she is having
[11:40] surgery Wednesday morning. praying that
[11:42] God guides the surgeon's hands and we
[11:44] can get everything taken care of. We're
[11:47] aiming that we're aiming for as well as
[11:49] a speedy recovery. So, let's ask the
[11:51] Lord to be with Sister Charity and the
[11:52] surgeon as she goes for this procedure.
[11:55] And then, Brother Warren is ministering
[11:57] to the youth at the church in San Jose
[11:59] this morning. Brother James is
[12:01] ministering for brother Lindseay McGrady
[12:03] in North Carolina. And so, let's also
[12:05] remember our pastor, Brother Ron.
[12:07] Brother Mario was there in the
[12:08] Philippines. May the Lord be with them.
[12:10] Brother James, if you would come, if you
[12:12] have a need this morning, you just want
[12:13] to lift it before the Lord with an
[12:14] upraised hand. And
[12:16] &gt;&gt; we serve a God that is more than able.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; We say it time and time again, but it's
[12:20] the truth. Amen. He is more than able.
[12:22] Brother James, if you would come.
[12:25] [Music]
[12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:29] I actually have two requests this
[12:31] morning as well that I've forgotten to
[12:33] pin down and I'm glad that uh Brother
[12:37] Mark called on me. Um,
[12:39] one of them is my brother-in-law over in
[12:42] uh my sister sent me a message this
[12:44] morning. My brother-in-law over in Fort
[12:45] Worth, Texas, uh, Daniel Syler. He's
[12:48] going in for a back surgery this week on
[12:50] Tuesday and uh, they've messaged over
[12:53] and asked for the prayer or for the
[12:55] church to pray and I told her that I
[12:57] would and I actually completely forgot
[12:58] to write it down. So, thank the Lord for
[13:01] bringing that to my remembrance this
[13:03] morning. We're grateful for those
[13:04] things, right? She had asked. So, and
[13:06] then another request. I have a young man
[13:08] that works for me at the chemical plant.
[13:10] He works in one of the departments there
[13:12] and his name is Anthony. He sat in my
[13:14] office on Friday and and uh sitting
[13:17] there talking to me about a personal
[13:19] struggle that he's going through. And I
[13:22] just asked him, I said, "What do you
[13:23] want?" And he said, "I just want you to
[13:26] pray."
[13:28] And I said, "You know what? We can do
[13:29] that.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; That we can do. can't fix the problems
[13:34] for you, but we can pray. And so I just
[13:37] said, you know, God honors that faith.
[13:39] And uh so his name is Anthony, and he's
[13:41] going through a very personal thing in
[13:43] his life, very, very difficult struggle.
[13:46] We just ask for prayer for him. So if
[13:48] you wouldn't mind, keep him in prayer as
[13:50] well in the upcoming weeks as he's uh
[13:52] battling with this in his personal life.
[13:54] So as I hold these requests, you know,
[13:56] just reading in my Bible this morning,
[13:59] Proverbs chapter 5, where Solomon was
[14:01] teaching his sons and said, you know,
[14:03] seek for wisdom of God above silver,
[14:06] above gold, we can, you know, if we put
[14:09] as much effort into seeking for the
[14:11] things of God as we do our job and our
[14:12] careers, my what a what a thing we would
[14:16] have, right?
[14:17] &gt;&gt; So anyway, let's bow our hearts before
[14:18] the Lord. Heavenly Father,
[14:22] [Music]
[14:23] as we come before you,
[14:28] as humbly as we know how, Lord, just
[14:31] bringing our petitions. I hold these
[14:33] needs in my hands, Lord. I'm just a man.
[14:38] We're just flesh and blood standing here
[14:40] this morning, but we're redeemed
[14:43] by the blood of the lamb. And Lord,
[14:45] that's what makes the difference.
[14:48] We know this morning as we bring our
[14:50] hearts to you, Lord, that many needs
[14:54] among the body.
[14:57] But Lord Jesus, you are the wonderful
[15:01] almighty God.
[15:04] And Lord, we praise you this morning.
[15:08] We thank you, Lord, for all that you are
[15:10] to us, Lord.
[15:13] all you've done for us, Lord. Even when
[15:15] we maybe wasn't seeking for you, you
[15:18] were continually searching for us. And
[15:21] Lord, we're so thankful
[15:23] &gt;&gt; for that mercy and that grace. And Lord,
[15:26] these petitions, Lord, we know that you
[15:30] have already made a way. Lord, you paid
[15:32] the price already. You finished the
[15:35] work. Help our faith this morning, Lord.
[15:38] Christ to a place where we could reach
[15:39] and accept, Lord, the finished work of
[15:42] Calvary. Lord, be with this service. I
[15:45] pray, Lord, every song that's sung,
[15:47] every voice that's lifted in worship,
[15:50] Lord, may you receive it this morning.
[15:52] Our sacrifice of pray. May we don't feel
[15:54] like it. Maybe we're weak in our body or
[15:57] we're just discouraged, Lord. Encourage
[16:00] the broken heart, Lord. Lord, the the
[16:04] troubled mind. And Lord, I pray that you
[16:06] would just comfort it. Ease, Lord, the
[16:09] thoughts this morning that would beset
[16:11] us. Lord, may we just praise your name
[16:14] regardless. Press past those things this
[16:17] morning. Help us is our prayer. Lord, be
[16:19] with the ministry of the word. Speak to
[16:21] our hearts, Lord. That's what we come
[16:23] here for, Lord, was to seek for more of
[16:25] you, Lord. Help us now. Bless everything
[16:28] in this service. We ask once again each
[16:30] and every person sitting here in your
[16:32] midst in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother James. You may be
[16:39] seated this morning. It's good to be in
[16:41] the house of the Lord. We welcome each
[16:42] one. If you're here visiting, we welcome
[16:44] you. It's good to have brother Larry,
[16:46] Sister Linda Anderson here back with us
[16:48] for the beautiful time of the year. So,
[16:51] it's good to have them here with us. and
[16:54] got an announcement here that church
[16:57] will be holding a lunch following the
[16:59] morning service on November the 2nd in
[17:02] honor of our ministry here. So there's a
[17:05] signup sheet over on the bulletin board
[17:06] in the hallway. So please sign up so we
[17:09] know how much food to plan for. If you
[17:10] have any questions, please contact
[17:12] Sister Linda Laauo. So we're looking
[17:14] forward to that. Amen. It's
[17:18] this weekend is the Canadian
[17:20] Thanksgiving for all my fellow
[17:21] Canadians. I wish you all a happy
[17:24] Canadian Thanksgiving. But we don't have
[17:25] to wait for a holiday to be thankful.
[17:28] I'm so thankful for all that God has
[17:30] done for each and every one of us.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we've come this morning to
[17:34] thank him, to worship him.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I have one whose hand I
[17:38] can hold on to. Amen. Jesus, hold my
[17:41] hand. Let's sing that this morning.
[17:44] Amen.
[17:47] As I travel through this pilgrim land,
[17:51] there is a friend who walks with me,
[17:57] leads me safely through the sinking sand
[18:02] is the Christ of Calary.
[18:07] And this would be my prayer, dear Lord,
[18:10] each day. Help me do the best I can.
[18:16] For I need thy light to guide me day and
[18:21] night. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.
[18:27] Oh Jesus,
[18:29] hold my hand.
[18:31] Oh, I need thee every hour
[18:37] through
[18:39] this pilgrim land.
[18:42] Protect me by thy power
[18:47] and hear
[18:48] my people flee.
[18:51] Oh Lord,
[18:53] look down on me.
[18:57] Heal in prayer. I know I'll meet you
[19:00] there. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand
[19:06] and let me travel in the light divine
[19:11] that I may see the blessed way.
[19:16] And keep me that I may be holy thine and
[19:21] sing redemption song someday.
[19:26] And I will be a soldier, brave and true.
[19:32] Take a stand
[19:36] fight onward go and daily meet the cold
[19:40] blessing Jesus hold my hand.
[19:46] Oh Jesus
[19:48] hold my hand.
[19:50] Oh, I need thee

[19:57] this pilgrim land.

[20:05] and hear my people flee.
[20:10] Oh Lord, to look down on me
[20:15] when I kneel in prayer. I know I'll meet
[20:19] you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.
[20:25] And when I wander through the valley,
[20:28] dimmed to the setting of the sun,
[20:35] and lead me safely to that land of rest.
[20:39] If I a crown of life have won
[20:44] and I have put my truth thee dear Lord
[20:50] reach that golden strand
[20:54] there's no other friend on whom I can
[20:58] depend blessing Jesus hold my hand
[21:04] oh Jesus

[21:08] Oh, I need thee
[21:11] every hour

[21:18] Protect me by thy power
[21:23] and hear my feeble plea.
[21:28] Oh Lord,
[21:30] look down on me.
[21:33] When I kneel in prayer, I know I'll meet
[21:36] you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.
[21:44] By and by,

[21:51] saints of God are gathered home, we will

[22:25] And we are often destitute of the things
[22:29] that life demands. Want of food and want
[22:32] of shelter.

[23:08] Trials dark on every hand. And we cannot
[23:12] understand all the ways that God would
[23:15] lead us to blessed promised land. But he
[23:19] guides us with his eye. And we'll follow
[23:22] till we die. For we'll understand it
[23:25] better by and by.

[25:35] morning. Brother Ray, if you'd be ready
[25:37] right after that.
[25:50] [Music]
[26:01] While the world
[26:04] looks upon me
[26:07] as a struggle
[26:10] alone
[26:13] and they say I
[26:16] have nothing.
[26:18] But they are so wrong.

[39:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads for a
[39:40] word of prayer.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Father, we need you, Lord.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; And we need you right now, Father. For
[39:48] Lord, we have needs and desires in our
[39:51] hearts that only you can satisfy.
[39:55] Lord, you are the great satisfier. And
[39:58] so, we pray that you would come and
[40:00] satisfy our soul. that you would heal
[40:02] our hearts, heal our minds, touch our
[40:05] lives, Lord. And may we leave this
[40:09] building this morning, Father,
[40:12] knowing your ways and knowing you just a
[40:16] little bit more, Father. May we see
[40:19] patterns within your word. May we see
[40:22] how you do things within your word,
[40:25] Father. Lord, that we may know you
[40:28] better. We love you, Lord. We thank you
[40:31] for all things. We thank you for the
[40:33] opportunity to come and to sit at your
[40:36] feet. We love you. We thank you. We
[40:38] commit all things into thy hands for thy
[40:41] kingdom's glory in Jesus Christ's name.
[40:44] Amen.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. It's
[40:48] certainly good to be in the house of the
[40:50] Lord.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you musicians. God bless you
[40:53] richly. Um, as you're turning to the
[40:56] book of John, chapter 3, we'll read
[40:59] verses 16- 18. Um, I have a couple of
[41:04] pictures and stuff here that I would
[41:06] like to show from brother Ron in the
[41:08] Philippines. And, um, it looks kind of
[41:12] small back there. Maybe you can see it
[41:13] there better. So, uh I don't know if any
[41:16] of you heard, but there was a an
[41:18] earthquake in the Philippines and um it
[41:21] was a 7.3 uh multitude. Pretty decent
[41:25] size. And so, the good thing is though
[41:28] for brother Ron, Brother Ron is on the
[41:31] you see where it says Manila, the
[41:33] northern part there, the northern
[41:35] island, not the topest northern part,
[41:37] but the one below it. So that's where
[41:39] brother Ron is is in Manila and the
[41:42] earthquake was on the southern island
[41:44] there of uh Men Mandua I think it's
[41:48] called. And so you know we woke up uh
[41:52] Friday morning and saw there was an
[41:53] earthquake and stuff. We're like oh no
[41:55] you know is brother Ron okay? And so
[41:58] good news brother Ron is okay and uh all
[42:01] the believers are okay also. They
[42:03] haven't heard any news of any fatalities
[42:05] for the believers. So, we just want to
[42:07] thank God for that this morning. And uh
[42:09] we have a few more pictures.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; There's brother Ron in the middle with
[42:14] all the ministers. This is at brother uh
[42:16] Danny Delmundo's church. Brother Ron
[42:18] preached there. I believe it was
[42:20] yesterday. And then he's going to preach
[42:22] this morning also.
[42:25] There they are with all their wives.
[42:29] I think we have a few more. There's
[42:31] brother Danny. What a beautiful pulpit,
[42:33] huh?
[42:37] couple of pictures of the congregation.
[42:40] That's the last one there. So, uh
[42:43] they're getting a lot of rain and um but
[42:45] that's okay. And brother Ron sent a
[42:49] little video to the board chat as well
[42:50] and it sounded like his voice it sounds
[42:53] a lot better. So, you know, um he
[42:56] usually he usually leaves healthy and
[42:58] come home sick. So, maybe he'll leave
[43:00] sick and come home healthy this time.
[43:02] So, I would rather have that, I think.
[43:04] And um so yeah, keep him in prayer. He
[43:07] has a service, you know, Sunday morning
[43:10] and then they have a service Sunday
[43:11] night and then Monday, I believe they
[43:14] have a ministers convention. There'll be
[43:15] 250 ministers there, questions and
[43:18] answers and so forth. So uh he coverets
[43:21] your prayers. Amen. John 3:16, very
[43:25] familiar portion of scripture for us.
[43:28] We'll read 16-18.
[43:31] For God so loved the world that he gave
[43:34] his only begotten son that whosoever
[43:37] believeth in him should not perish but
[43:40] have everlasting life. For God sent not
[43:43] his son into the world to condemn the
[43:46] world, but that the world through him
[43:49] might be saved. He that believeth on him
[43:52] is not condemned. Thank you, Lord. But
[43:55] he that believeth not is condemned
[43:58] already. because he hath not believed in
[44:01] the name of the only begotten son of
[44:04] God. Turn with me in your Bibles to the
[44:07] first uh first John. We call it in
[44:11] Ireland small John. 1 John chapter 4.
[44:16] We'll read verses 9 and 10.
[44:22] Hallelujah.
[44:24] God is good.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[44:29] Verse N says, "In this was manifested
[44:32] the love of God toward us, because that
[44:35] God sent his only begotten son into the
[44:38] world that we might live through him.
[44:43] Herein is love, not that we loved God,
[44:46] but that he loved us
[44:50] and sent his son to be a propitiation
[44:53] for our sins."
[44:57] Hallelujah. Herein is love. Not that we
[45:00] loved God, but that he first loved us.
[45:04] Amen. You may take your seat this
[45:06] morning.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add a blessing to the
[45:10] reading of his word.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; I would like to title my sermon this
[45:15] morning, the love of God.
[45:18] Many books have been written, many songs
[45:21] have been sang, many poems have been
[45:24] written
[45:25] about the love of God. And no doubt
[45:29] people have written these books and sang
[45:32] these songs and poems and whatever it
[45:34] might be through uh an inspiration of
[45:38] how they felt the love of God in their
[45:41] lives. And you know, it's kind of
[45:45] interesting when you begin to think of
[45:47] God and and you begin to think of God's
[45:50] love and you begin to ask the question,
[45:53] you know, how does how does God actually
[45:56] love? How does God pro uh portray his
[46:00] love toward us? And how do we accept his
[46:05] love? Is is his love is it just a is it
[46:08] just a feeling? Is it a warm cozy
[46:11] feeling that uh whenever we're down in
[46:13] the dumps or whenever our heart is
[46:16] broken and and and and and things aren't
[46:19] going uh very well in our lives that we
[46:21] feel uh the outstretched arms of God's
[46:25] love and he comforts us and he and he
[46:27] hugs us and he and he and he warms our
[46:30] heart and and stuff like that. Is it is
[46:32] that all that God's love is? Is it just
[46:36] a a cozy feeling? Is it just an emotion
[46:39] of of of of how God makes us feel on the
[46:44] inside of our hearts? Or what is the
[46:47] real love of God?
[46:50] And if the Bible says that God is love,
[46:55] how does he love his children? And if
[46:58] God is love, does God love everybody?
[47:03] &gt;&gt; It's a good question. Because if God is
[47:06] love and he portrays his love, I want to
[47:09] know how God loves. Because how God
[47:12] loves me, I want to love my brother.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Because through the love of God, uh it
[47:20] gives us an example of how we are to
[47:24] love one another.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this morning I I don't want to
[47:30] uh I don't want to preach upon our love
[47:33] towards God but I want to minister on
[47:36] God's love toward us because I believe
[47:41] that it is a subject that is uh
[47:44] misunderstood perhaps and whenever um
[47:48] there's a misunderstanding
[47:51] and we don't understand love we won't
[47:54] understand God and therefore we'll think
[47:57] that God does not love us because we
[47:59] don't understand how he loves.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; So we see that um whenever we think of
[48:06] of God's love and and if you were to ask
[48:09] people well what what is God's love and
[48:12] what does what does it mean for you? No
[48:15] doubt people would say well God's love
[48:17] is an unconditional love which is true.
[48:21] God made an unconditional covenant to
[48:24] Abraham and he said it's not by your
[48:26] works Abraham or it's not by what you're
[48:29] going to do but it's what I have already
[48:31] done for you. And so people will will in
[48:35] in Christianom around the world, they'll
[48:38] take this unconditional love of God and
[48:42] they'll say, "Well, God loves me just
[48:44] how I am." Because God is love. And
[48:49] therefore, no matter how I live my life,
[48:51] whether I'm uh a homosexual or whether
[48:54] I'm a I' I've changed my sex or whatever
[48:58] it may be, God God is love. And so
[49:02] therefore, God loves me for who I am and
[49:05] for how I am. And God knows my heart.
[49:12] I want I don't want to uh lock up your
[49:16] hard drive this morning or and I don't
[49:18] want you to to put the brakes on on me
[49:21] uh at the very start of the service, but
[49:23] I want to make this comment and I want
[49:25] to say just because somebody loves God,
[49:29] it does not mean that God loves that
[49:31] person. Amen.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; There are millions of people in the
[49:36] world today who confess Jesus Christ,
[49:38] who confess with their mouth, and they
[49:40] they read John 3:16 and they read the
[49:43] word where it says, "If you'll believe
[49:45] in thine heart, and if you'll confess
[49:47] the Lord Jesus, uh you'll be saved and
[49:50] that and that God loves you." And people
[49:52] take this scripture and they run with
[49:54] it, but yet they live any kind of life
[49:57] that they want to live and they use the
[50:00] scripture. Well, I've confessed with my
[50:02] mouth and I believe in my heart.
[50:04] Therefore, there's nothing else that I
[50:06] can do. And I love the Lord Jesus
[50:08] Christ. They they make a confession with
[50:11] their mouth. But the Bible says that
[50:13] this people uh they honorth me with
[50:16] their mouth, but yet their hearts are
[50:20] far from me. So therefore, there is a
[50:23] people that love God and it's a sincere
[50:26] love, but yet God does not love them
[50:30] back.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Just because somebody confesses to love
[50:37] the Lord, a confession is not a
[50:40] conversion.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Write it down.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Confession is not conversion. A
[50:46] confession is a little stone. A a
[50:49] confession is just words out of your
[50:51] mouth. But until the confession becomes
[50:54] a conversion, the love of God is not in
[50:57] that person's heart.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. Brothers,
[51:00] &gt;&gt; we can confess with our mouths all we
[51:02] want. But if our lives is not changed by
[51:05] the supernatural power of Jesus Christ,
[51:08] it is not a conversion.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says he told Peter,
[51:14] "When you're converted,
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Peter preached. He cast out devils. He
[51:19] did many things. He believed in the
[51:21] Lord. But yet Jesus told him, "Whenever
[51:25] you're converted, whenever you've
[51:27] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[51:31] then feed my sheep."
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; There's many people in Christendom today
[51:37] who are confessing and who who I would
[51:40] say who believe but yet have never been
[51:44] converted. You say, "How do you know
[51:46] that, brother Stephen?" All you got to
[51:47] do is look at the fruits in their lives.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; And so people will take this love of God
[51:53] and they'll say, "Well, if you don't
[51:55] agree with everything and if you don't
[51:58] love everybody, how can you be a
[52:00] Christian?" No. A real Christian will
[52:02] stand upon the word of God.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; No matter what politicians say, no
[52:08] matter what school teachers say, no
[52:10] matter what the neighbors say, the true
[52:13] Christian will stand upon the word of
[52:16] God and the truth of it.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Matthew 7 21- 23. Not everyone that
[52:24] saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter
[52:27] into the kingdom of heaven, but he that
[52:30] doeth the will of my father which is in
[52:32] heaven, many will say unto me in that
[52:35] day, many
[52:37] people who have a confession of God.
[52:40] Many people who confess that they
[52:43] believe in the Lord Jesus Christ will
[52:45] come to him in that day. Many people
[52:47] that love the Lord,
[52:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:51] &gt;&gt; They love the Lord.
[52:54] And they'll say, Lord, Lord, have not we
[52:57] prophesied in thy name? And in thy name
[53:00] have cast out devils, and in thy name
[53:02] done many wonderful works. And then will
[53:05] I profess unto them? I never knew you.
[53:08] Depart from me, ye that work iniquity. I
[53:11] never birthed you. You were never
[53:13] converted. I never had an intimate
[53:17] relationship with you. Yes, you
[53:19] confessed me. You believed, but yet but
[53:21] yet you stopped right there.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; What is the point in having a confession
[53:27] &gt;&gt; and not a conversion?
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of us sitting here
[53:34] this morning in a message church have a
[53:37] confession of the heart, but yet we've
[53:39] never been converted. I say, Father,
[53:42] move upon the hearts of your people and
[53:45] bring a conversion in our lives. Lord,
[53:48] don't stop there. Give me a refilling of
[53:51] your spirit.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Matthew 15 7-9. Ye hypocrites,
[53:57] well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
[53:59] "This people draweth nigh unto me with
[54:01] their mouth and honorth me with their
[54:04] lips, but their heart is far from me.
[54:08] But in vain they do worship me, teaching
[54:10] for doctrines the commandments of men."
[54:14] People with a confession, people
[54:17] believing onto eternal life, but never
[54:21] fully accepting eternal life by being
[54:25] converted.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; What a place, what a terrible place to
[54:30] be in. That's why brother Brandon would
[54:33] say, "And that day, the bootleger is is
[54:36] not going to be uh uh what's the word?
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Disappointed." Thank you.
[54:42] the the unclean woman on the street is
[54:44] not going to be disappointed, but it's
[54:46] going to be those who have confessed
[54:48] Christianity when they get on that day
[54:51] and they realize they had a confession,
[54:53] but they didn't possess what they were
[54:55] confessing.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be there.
[55:04] in this next uh um
[55:09] sermon here quotes that I would like to
[55:12] read. Um brother Brandham in the
[55:15] previous paragraphs is is talking about
[55:18] his first experience with the
[55:19] Pentecostal people and this is very
[55:22] familiar to us and that's okay. I will
[55:25] just reiterate it into your minds and
[55:27] into your hearts and you can all say
[55:29] amen because you've heard it before. But
[55:32] the Bible says this, "Put them in
[55:34] remembrance of these things."
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; And I don't want to dwell too long if I
[55:40] if I can help it upon those who love
[55:43] God. And but God doesn't love back. But
[55:45] I I just felt like I wanted to answer
[55:48] that question because because it is
[55:51] something that almost seems unfair
[55:55] because we all know people in our lives,
[55:57] whether it's friends, family,
[55:59] co-workers, or our neighbors, or whoever
[56:02] it is that that confess Christianity,
[56:04] but yet you can see in their lives that
[56:08] there's just something lacking.
[56:10] Just because somebody says they love the
[56:13] Lord, it does not mean that the Lord
[56:16] loves them back.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brham is talking about his
[56:21] first Pentecostal experience and the two
[56:24] men that were prophesying and speaking
[56:26] in tongues. And you all remember that
[56:28] the one was a real genuine Christian and
[56:31] the other one was an absolute hypocrite.
[56:34] The seed of discrepancy, 1965.
[56:37] Two years later, I'd been praying in a
[56:39] cave where I would go to pray. Got dusty
[56:41] in the cave. And one afternoon, I walked
[56:43] out, laid my Bible on a log, and the
[56:45] wind blowed it open to Hebrews the 6th
[56:48] chapter, which said, "In the last days,
[56:50] how it would be if if we fell away from
[56:53] the truth, and renewed ourselves again
[56:54] unto repentance. Uh, there was no more
[56:57] sacrifice for sin, and how the thorns
[56:59] and thistles, which was nigh unto
[57:01] rejection, whose end is to be burned.
[57:03] But the rain cometh upon the earth often
[57:05] to water it to dress it. But the thorns
[57:07] and thistles would be rejected, but the
[57:09] wheat would be gathered. And I thought,
[57:11] well, it was just the wind happened to
[57:14] blow it open. Well, I just laid the
[57:16] Bible down again and I thought, well,
[57:18] here come the wind and blowed it open.
[57:20] That happened three times and I thought,
[57:22] well, now that's strange.
[57:25] You know, sometimes we have to think,
[57:28] uh, this is the third time in a row that
[57:30] this has happened. There's something
[57:32] strange going on here. This is this is
[57:35] the third person that has come to me and
[57:37] given me the same advice without knowing
[57:40] each other. Perhaps God is trying to
[57:43] show me something here.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; And then I raised up and I thought,
[57:48] Lord, why would you open that Bible for
[57:50] me to read when I get down to that where
[57:52] thorns and thistles which is nigh into
[57:54] rejection whose hand is to be burned. I
[57:56] thought, why would you open that to me
[57:57] there? Now, these real visions come
[58:00] without pulling into any gear. That's
[58:02] just God. See? And I looked and I seen
[58:04] an earth that was turning out in front
[58:06] of me. Now, watch what God is doing for
[58:10] his prophet. His prophet, he he's been
[58:13] thinking about this question now for two
[58:15] years. And he gets alone with God and he
[58:17] goes to his cave and he has this
[58:20] question upon upon how can how can how
[58:23] can this be that one man was genuine and
[58:26] the other one was a hypocrite? And so
[58:28] now God takes his prophet and he's
[58:31] giving him a vision to interpret his
[58:34] question, to answer his question. And
[58:37] you're going to see that the
[58:38] interpretation of the vision is actually
[58:42] scriptural
[58:43] because the Lord always stays with his
[58:46] word.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; And uh there was a man dressed in white
[58:55] went around sewing wheat. And after he
[58:57] went around the curvature of the earth
[58:59] around come a man looked horrible. He
[59:01] was dressed in black and he was throwing
[59:03] weed seeds all over it. They both came
[59:05] up together and when they did they both
[59:07] was thirsty because a rain was needed
[59:09] and each one looked like was praying.
[59:12] Understand the weed was praying and the
[59:15] the wheat was praying. They were both
[59:17] praying for the same thing. One is
[59:20] genuine and one is a hypocrite.
[59:24] And when they did, they were both
[59:26] thirsty because they needed rain and
[59:27] with his and looked like praying with
[59:29] his little head bent over, "Lord, send
[59:31] the rain. Send the rain." And the great
[59:34] clouds come up and the rain fell upon
[59:36] both of them. And when it did, the
[59:37] little wheat jumped up and began to say,
[59:39] "Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord." The
[59:42] little weed jumped up right at the same
[59:44] side and said, "Praise the Lord. Praise
[59:47] the Lord." So you've got the wheat and
[59:49] the weed praising the Lord for answered
[59:52] prayer.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; And then the vision was interpreted.
[59:56] Notice how the vision was t interpreted.
[59:59] It was interpreted by scriptures.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; The rain falls on the just and the
[1:00:05] unjust. The same spirit can fall in a
[1:00:08] meeting and everybody rejoice in it.
[1:00:10] Hypocrites, Christians, and allto
[1:00:12] together. Exactly right. But what is it?
[1:00:15] By their fruits they are known. See
[1:00:18] that's the only way it can ever be
[1:00:20] known. Then you see that now since wild
[1:00:23] oats or wild wheat and grain sometimes
[1:00:26] impersonates a genuine domestic grain.
[1:00:30] Notice the word impersonates
[1:00:33] because an impersonator is a hypocrite.
[1:00:38] So he says, "Sometimes it impersonates a
[1:00:40] genuine domestic grain so close that it
[1:00:44] would deceive the very elected." I think
[1:00:47] we're living in a timely age when these
[1:00:50] things should be preached on and talked
[1:00:53] about.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; We're living in a very timely age right
[1:00:59] now.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; When these things should be preached on
[1:01:04] and talked about. What things is he
[1:01:07] talking about that should be preached on
[1:01:09] and talking about? He's talking about
[1:01:11] hypocrisy within the church. He's
[1:01:15] talking about a weed and a weak
[1:01:17] fellowshipping together, but one is an
[1:01:20] absolute hypocrite. And how do you know
[1:01:22] that it's a hypocrite? Because it's
[1:01:24] living a double life.
[1:01:28] He says hypocrisy within the church,
[1:01:31] hypocrisy within the local assembly
[1:01:35] should be preached on
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; and talked about.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; So what is hypocrisy? Hypocrisy is quite
[1:01:42] simply this. Living a double life.
[1:01:45] coming to church, putting on your best
[1:01:47] clothes, putting on your halo, knowing
[1:01:50] what to say, knowing when to say amen,
[1:01:52] knowing when to clap your hands at a
[1:01:55] certain point in a certain song, knowing
[1:01:57] what to do at the right time, knowing
[1:01:59] how to fellowship with people outside of
[1:02:02] outside the church building, but when
[1:02:04] you get home to live your normal life,
[1:02:07] the life is different than what you're
[1:02:09] professing within the assembly.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Absolute hypocrisy. It should be
[1:02:15] preached on and it should be talked
[1:02:17] about.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Hypocrisy within the life of a person
[1:02:24] who is saying they are a believer but
[1:02:26] yet their lives by their fruits ye shall
[1:02:31] know them.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; You're the only one that knows the fruit
[1:02:36] in your life. Yeah,
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; you're the only one who knows what
[1:02:40] happens at home when no other believers
[1:02:42] are around. I want you to understand
[1:02:45] this concept. You might be able to fool
[1:02:47] the preacher. You might be able to fool
[1:02:49] the pastor. You might be able to fool
[1:02:51] everybody else in church, but there's
[1:02:53] one person who you're not going to fool,
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; and that's God.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Because God knows our going ins. He
[1:03:00] knows our going outs. He knows the
[1:03:03] secret things that we do in private. God
[1:03:06] knows all things.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; So therefore, I believe that hypocrisy
[1:03:12] ought to be out of the life of every
[1:03:13] believer.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Good preaching.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; What's the point in coming to church and
[1:03:20] being a hypocrite?
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; You might as well just be a sinner.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; What's the point?
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; And you know why it happens? Because
[1:03:30] people have just enough of God in them.
[1:03:33] just enough of a desire to serve them
[1:03:36] that they want to go to church.
[1:03:39] They have a confession.
[1:03:41] That's my confession. That's what I do.
[1:03:44] But a conversion will change it.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Hypocrisy.
[1:03:52] Hypocrisy has been in the church since
[1:03:54] the first church age. it and and it has
[1:03:57] rolled and it has snowballed down to
[1:04:00] where we're at this very last age where
[1:04:03] sin is we could say is seven times
[1:04:05] hotter where the furnace is seven times
[1:04:07] hotter and where sin has just snowballed
[1:04:09] and compounded so much to where we can't
[1:04:12] get away from it
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; but understand this concept the choice
[1:04:16] is yours
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; the choice is yours
[1:04:23] you don't have to be a hypocrite No.
[1:04:26] Amen.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; You don't have to live a double life,
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; but you can live a life filled with the
[1:04:34] love of God,
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; serving him to the fullest of your
[1:04:38] potential.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; So, I'll go back to my question.
[1:04:50] So if God doesn't love all those who
[1:04:54] love him, then it the question we we we
[1:04:58] should ask ourselves then who does God
[1:05:00] love?
[1:05:02] If he doesn't love everybody that loves
[1:05:04] him, who does he love?
[1:05:07] And how does he show his love to the
[1:05:09] people that he does love?
[1:05:12] Hallelujah.
[1:05:17] Love very often is misunderstood
[1:05:22] when we fail to understand one another.
[1:05:26] Whether it's in a relationship with a
[1:05:29] wife or a husband, a spouse, whether
[1:05:31] it's a relationship between a a a parent
[1:05:34] and a child or a child and a parent or
[1:05:37] siblings or just uh friendships amongst
[1:05:40] each other. When you misunderstand each
[1:05:43] other and you don't really know the
[1:05:45] person, it it it gives a a
[1:05:48] misunderstanding of well, I don't know
[1:05:50] if they really like me. I don't know if
[1:05:53] they really love me. I don't know if
[1:05:55] they're really my friend. Uh I I I don't
[1:05:58] know. A lot of times when you don't know
[1:06:01] somebody, uh the first thing you do is,
[1:06:03] well, I don't like that person.
[1:06:07] You don't. I had somebody tell me that
[1:06:10] one time. I don't like that person. I
[1:06:12] said, really? How much time have you
[1:06:15] spent with that person?
[1:06:17] Not very much.
[1:06:19] Well, how can you cast a judgment upon
[1:06:22] somebody that you're saying you don't
[1:06:24] like them when you don't know them?
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:28] And so a lot of times within our
[1:06:31] marriages and our our relationships with
[1:06:34] our children, no matter what the age may
[1:06:36] be, when we don't understand that
[1:06:40] person's love toward us, we will think
[1:06:42] that the person does not love us.
[1:06:46] When we don't understand a love language
[1:06:49] and how a person um expresses themselves
[1:06:53] to the person that they love dearly,
[1:06:56] when we don't know what their love
[1:06:58] language is and we don't understand it,
[1:07:00] all of a sudden we begin to think that
[1:07:04] person doesn't love me.
[1:07:07] My spouse doesn't love me. My husband
[1:07:10] doesn't give me the love that I need. My
[1:07:12] wife, she doesn't love me. she because
[1:07:16] uh uh she doesn't do the things that I
[1:07:18] think she she should do and projecting
[1:07:21] her love. And kids look to their parents
[1:07:23] and they say, "Well, mom and dad doesn't
[1:07:25] love me." It's just because it's not
[1:07:27] because they don't love them. It's
[1:07:30] because the person doesn't understand
[1:07:33] how the person loves.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; And so it is with God. When we
[1:07:38] misunderstand the love of God, we'll get
[1:07:42] to thinking in our hearts, God doesn't
[1:07:44] love me,
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; because we'll go through things in life
[1:07:48] and and and dark places in our life and
[1:07:50] we'll and we'll begin to think, well, if
[1:07:53] this is the love of God, God doesn't
[1:07:56] love me. Why would he let me go through
[1:07:58] this? Why would this happen? And we
[1:08:00] begin to question ourselves. and we
[1:08:03] begin to question God's love for us.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Whenever we don't understand the and how
[1:08:10] somebody expresses their love to us and
[1:08:14] a spouse or whatever it is, when we when
[1:08:16] we fail to see how they're expressing
[1:08:19] it, the devil will creep into our minds
[1:08:23] and into our hearts, honey, will say,
[1:08:25] "That person doesn't love you.
[1:08:28] Why do they not love me?
[1:08:31] And why do we think that? It's just
[1:08:33] because we don't understand their love
[1:08:36] language.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; In Malachi 1:es 2 and 3, it says, "I
[1:08:43] have loved you, saith the Lord.
[1:08:47] Yet ye say, this is amazing. God is
[1:08:51] telling the the people of Israel here, I
[1:08:54] have loved you, but yet ye say, wherein
[1:08:57] hast thou loved us?" Amen.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; God has loved them. He has shown their
[1:09:02] love towards Israel.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; But because they misunderstand the love
[1:09:07] of God.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Their response to God is, "How have you
[1:09:11] loved us?
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; You say you love us. I don't see your
[1:09:16] love.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Wherein hast thou loved us?" Was not
[1:09:19] Esau Jacob's brother, sayeth the Lord.
[1:09:22] Yet I loved Jacob and I hated Esau and
[1:09:25] laid his mountains and his heritage
[1:09:26] waste for the dragons of the wilderness.
[1:09:31] The peep God here was God that great
[1:09:34] fountain of love
[1:09:38] and he had loved Israel but because
[1:09:41] Israel didn't understand the love of God
[1:09:44] and how God portrays his love and how
[1:09:47] God shows his love because they didn't
[1:09:50] understand it. they thought in their
[1:09:51] hearts,
[1:09:54] how do you love us?
[1:09:56] Do you see the situation that we're in?
[1:10:00] Have you seen my life? You say you loved
[1:10:02] us, but how?
[1:10:06] And no doubt they had a complex in their
[1:10:08] heart towards God and towards his love
[1:10:11] for them because they misunderstood how
[1:10:13] God loves.
[1:10:18] There's a
[1:10:20] There's this thing and I'm sure a lot of
[1:10:22] you are aware of it. And if you've never
[1:10:25] done it, I think you should do it. And
[1:10:28] it's called the five love languages.
[1:10:31] And you should do it with your husband,
[1:10:33] with your wife, and you should do it
[1:10:35] with your children because guess what?
[1:10:38] And I'm and I'm talking I'm not t
[1:10:40] talking just little kids. I'm talking
[1:10:42] you people that are grandparents. You
[1:10:45] need to understand how your children and
[1:10:48] how your grandchildren love.
[1:10:52] So there's this quiz that you can take
[1:10:54] online and uh and it's worth doing every
[1:10:56] couple of years. And the reason being is
[1:10:59] this is because your love language
[1:11:02] changes with time.
[1:11:05] So it's this little quiz. You can just
[1:11:07] Google five love languages quiz, right?
[1:11:10] go on there, take the quiz, and it'll
[1:11:12] you'll answer these questions and and
[1:11:15] it'll spit out the answer of your top
[1:11:17] three love languages or your top two
[1:11:20] love languages. Okay?
[1:11:22] And
[1:11:24] me and me and Ashlin, we did it when we
[1:11:27] first got married. And um and it just it
[1:11:30] was just very interesting
[1:11:32] because it's good to know how your
[1:11:35] spouse loves
[1:11:39] because when they're showing you their
[1:11:41] love and you don't know that that's how
[1:11:44] they love and how they're showing their
[1:11:46] appreciation and love towards you and
[1:11:49] you miss it and you give way to Satan,
[1:11:52] all of a sudden the spouse is going to
[1:11:54] think that person he or she should be
[1:11:57] loving me this way because this is how I
[1:12:00] receive love. But yet their love
[1:12:04] language is different than yours. And so
[1:12:07] they're giving something and you're not
[1:12:08] receiving it. And all of a sudden you
[1:12:10] think in your heart, my goodness, we're
[1:12:13] falling out of love.
[1:12:15] We don't love each other anymore. No,
[1:12:17] you just don't understand each other
[1:12:19] well enough.
[1:12:20] So, when we first got married, um
[1:12:23] Ashlin's I forget what hers was, but I
[1:12:26] remember one of them. I think her top
[1:12:28] one was gift giving was gifts. I'll let
[1:12:31] me tell you the five words of
[1:12:33] affirmation, quality time, gifts, giving
[1:12:37] and receiving, physical touch, and acts
[1:12:40] of service.
[1:12:42] So, her top one was gifts. So, giving
[1:12:46] gifts and receiving gifts. And so, you
[1:12:50] know, whenever you think of a giftgiver,
[1:12:53] a giftgiver also likes to receive gifts.
[1:12:57] And it took me years to figure out
[1:13:01] that it doesn't have to be something
[1:13:03] expensive.
[1:13:06] All it has to be is a little something
[1:13:08] that says, "I was thinking about you. I
[1:13:12] saw this and this reminded me of you.
[1:13:16] Therefore, I bought this from the dollar
[1:13:18] store just for you.
[1:13:24] You guys are like, "You're cheap.
[1:13:28] It's still a gift."
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; The gift is not what is in question
[1:13:34] here. It's the heart behind it.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, I I do this a lot. And
[1:13:42] so I just, you know, it's okay because
[1:13:45] it keeps me real and it keeps me
[1:13:47] grounded. I would go and say I'm getting
[1:13:50] home early or something and there's a
[1:13:52] Dutch Bros on the way home, I'll stop
[1:13:53] and get myself a Dutch Bros.
[1:13:57] myself
[1:14:00] and I get home and I'll drink it.
[1:14:03] Yeah, that went down really well.
[1:14:07] I'll share it with you, honey.
[1:14:10] until and it took me years. Literally,
[1:14:13] I'm a little slow, but I catch on quick.
[1:14:20] Took me a while to figure out. It's not
[1:14:23] that she wants coffee. It's just that
[1:14:26] she likes to know that, hey, you were
[1:14:29] thinking about me when you went for
[1:14:31] coffee, and you got me my favorite
[1:14:34] sugar-free coffee. So, I stepped it up
[1:14:37] one time and I had the barista write I
[1:14:39] love you on it.
[1:14:42] Extra brownie point.
[1:14:44] It's not the size of the gift. And and
[1:14:48] so me personally, okay, I'm not a
[1:14:51] giftgiver. Like I just I just didn't
[1:14:53] think about that stuff, you know, only
[1:14:56] child, think about yourself most of the
[1:14:58] time, okay?
[1:15:01] And so I just didn't think about it. So
[1:15:04] sometimes Ashlin would come home from
[1:15:06] doing the groceries and there she would
[1:15:09] buy me my favorite candy bar, Kinder
[1:15:12] Buenos. They're so good.
[1:15:18] Yeah, they're so good. They're my
[1:15:21] favorite. So she would bring it home and
[1:15:23] it says caramel and it's got all this
[1:15:24] stuff in it and and they only started
[1:15:27] making them, you know, selling them here
[1:15:29] this past few years. The only place you
[1:15:31] could really get them was like World
[1:15:32] Market or something. is like an Irish
[1:15:33] candy. Go figure. Go bueno. And uh and
[1:15:37] so she would come home and I would have
[1:15:40] that little candy bar. Oh, that that's
[1:15:43] nice. Thank you. You know, and just eat
[1:15:45] it without realizing. She saw the candy
[1:15:48] bar and she thought of me because that
[1:15:51] is her way of of of showing and
[1:15:54] projecting her love to me was through
[1:15:57] the the the love of giving and the
[1:16:00] giving of gifts. And it took me a while
[1:16:03] to realize that this is her love
[1:16:05] language. Even though I knew it was was
[1:16:08] gifts, it took a while for the penny to
[1:16:11] really drop. Then I realized this is how
[1:16:15] she is showing her love towards me and
[1:16:18] showing me that while she was out doing
[1:16:20] the shopping, she was thinking of me.
[1:16:24] That was her love language.
[1:16:27] And so the years go on. We've been
[1:16:29] married 13 years thereabouts. And
[1:16:33] so the years go on and we're like, you
[1:16:35] know what? We should do this again.
[1:16:37] Let's do the love language test again.
[1:16:39] Well, lo and behold,
[1:16:41] it changed.
[1:16:43] You got four, five, six kids later, you
[1:16:47] take the test, it's no longer
[1:16:50] giftgiving. Yet, it's still there. But
[1:16:53] now her love language is quality time.
[1:16:58] Why is it quality time?
[1:17:03] Yeah. Six kids later, you don't have a
[1:17:06] lot of quality time, brother.
[1:17:10] And so, if I'm still trying to serve and
[1:17:13] love her through the giving of gifts,
[1:17:16] yet it's still nice, but it changes
[1:17:18] through time.
[1:17:21] And so now I need to make sure that I
[1:17:24] set aside some time. And you better
[1:17:28] believe it. We're going on a date
[1:17:30] tonight.
[1:17:32] That we set aside some quality time one
[1:17:35] with another. Why? So she so that I can
[1:17:38] make sure that she knows that I love
[1:17:41] her. That I'm that I'm that I'm doing my
[1:17:44] part to spend quality time with her
[1:17:47] because that is what she needs. at this
[1:17:50] time in our marriage.
[1:17:52] Now, if I if if if if uh words of
[1:17:57] affirmation is one,
[1:17:59] words of affirmation was was at the very
[1:18:02] beginning one of my love languages.
[1:18:05] And so, if I'm trying to love her with
[1:18:08] words of affirmation,
[1:18:11] but yet it's not her love language, but
[1:18:13] it's mine.
[1:18:15] It's not received as love unless she
[1:18:17] knows it's my love language.
[1:18:20] Physical touch, a hug, whatever it may
[1:18:23] be. That's one of my uh that's one of
[1:18:27] the love languages,
[1:18:29] you know, Henry, my my son, like just
[1:18:33] started kindergarten, right? And uh and
[1:18:36] the teacher, so they do the written
[1:18:38] reports, all this stuff.
[1:18:39] Yeah. And she says, "I love my my many
[1:18:44] daily hugs from Henry."
[1:18:46] Like, Henry, one hug in the morning, one
[1:18:50] hug after church, after school. That's
[1:18:52] enough. Okay? You don't always have to
[1:18:55] be hugging the teacher.
[1:18:59] But guess what it is?
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; It's his love language,
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; He loves to hug. He loves to cuddle. and
[1:19:06] Ashlin and she she brought it to my
[1:19:08] attention and she said don't take away
[1:19:11] his love language because that's how
[1:19:13] he's expressing his love toward his
[1:19:16] teacher and his gratefulness and his
[1:19:18] thankfulness cuz she's such a good
[1:19:20] teacher
[1:19:22] physical touch. And so now I need to
[1:19:26] make sure give me a hug son because I
[1:19:29] know that's that's his language and I
[1:19:32] need to speak his language and I need to
[1:19:35] understand his language and he needs to
[1:19:38] know that I understand his language and
[1:19:40] I don't love him with my language but I
[1:19:42] love back with his own language. That
[1:19:45] way he doesn't misunderstand and say dad
[1:19:48] doesn't love me cuz he never wants to
[1:19:50] give me a hug.
[1:19:53] But when I embrace him and I wait until
[1:19:56] he's done with the hug and I don't let
[1:19:59] go of the hug first, he knows, he
[1:20:02] understands because that's his language,
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Is physical touch.
[1:20:09] So we need to understand one another. We
[1:20:13] need to understand your spouse's love
[1:20:16] language because if you don't understand
[1:20:19] it and if their love language has
[1:20:21] changed, you're going to misunderstand
[1:20:23] and all of a sudden you're going to be
[1:20:24] like Israel looking at God and looking
[1:20:26] at your husband, looking at your wife
[1:20:27] and saying, "You don't love me anymore.
[1:20:31] Why don't you love me?" The kids will
[1:20:34] look at mom and dad and say, "You don't
[1:20:37] love me.
[1:20:39] You don't treat me with love." Yet, they
[1:20:41] are. They're just doing it in a
[1:20:43] different way. And when you
[1:20:46] misunderstand it, that's when Satan can
[1:20:48] creep into our hearts, into our minds,
[1:20:50] and affect our lives.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; And if they don't know what yours is,
[1:20:58] you know, it doesn't have to be this
[1:21:00] great secret.
[1:21:02] Well, I'm just going to let them figure
[1:21:04] it out. Nonsense.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; This is my love language towards you.
[1:21:09] This is how I love you. When I do this,
[1:21:11] I am showing that I love you. That way
[1:21:14] they know. Every time you show your
[1:21:17] affirmation or your love for your loved
[1:21:19] one, guess what? They receive it because
[1:21:22] they understand you.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:35] So, how does God love us? We've talked
[1:21:39] about spouses and we've talked about
[1:21:41] children and so on and so forth. But but
[1:21:44] who does God love
[1:21:47] and how does God show his love towards
[1:21:51] those who he loves?
[1:21:54] The scripture has the answer. I am so
[1:21:57] thankful for a prophet of God in this
[1:22:00] hour and in this day because now we
[1:22:03] don't have to wonder how does God love
[1:22:06] and who does he love because the answer
[1:22:08] is in the message.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; You don't have to look very far to find
[1:22:14] the answer.
[1:22:17] An exposition of the seven church ages.
[1:22:20] Uh this is the Leodysian church age
[1:22:22] book. Brother Brandham says, "Let us
[1:22:24] examine the first phrase, as many as I
[1:22:27] love." You can find that in Revelation
[1:22:31] 3:9. That's to this church age. As many
[1:22:35] as I love. So, he's he's going to start
[1:22:38] telling us there's many of people that I
[1:22:40] love. And he's going to start explaining
[1:22:43] to us how God loves the many. Not
[1:22:47] everybody, but how God loves the many.
[1:22:53] In the Greek, the emphasis is upon the
[1:22:56] personal pronoun I. He does not say as
[1:22:59] many would feel. He should say as many
[1:23:03] as love me. No sir, we must never try to
[1:23:07] make Jesus the object of human love in
[1:23:10] this verse. No, it is the many that are
[1:23:14] the loved ones of God. It is his love in
[1:23:18] question, not ours. So it's not to
[1:23:22] everybody. It doesn't say I love
[1:23:25] everybody therefore I do this. But he's
[1:23:28] saying to the many that I love. And I
[1:23:31] believe I'm looking at the many here
[1:23:34] this morning who is a part of that
[1:23:36] scripture.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; So once again we find ourselves glorying
[1:23:42] in his in his salvation, his purpose and
[1:23:45] his plan. And we are confirmed even more
[1:23:48] strongly in the truth of the doctrine of
[1:23:50] the sovereignity of God. Even as he said
[1:23:53] in Romans 9:13, "Jacob have I loved,
[1:23:56] does it now obtain that since he loved
[1:23:59] only the many, is he therefore in a
[1:24:02] state of complacency, awaiting the love
[1:24:04] of those who have not drawn nigh to him?
[1:24:07] By no means is this so, for he declared
[1:24:09] also in Romans 13, Esau have I hated."
[1:24:14] So now he's he's making a
[1:24:16] differentiation
[1:24:18] between Esau and Jacob who were twins.
[1:24:20] And in every revival and in every move
[1:24:22] of God, there's twins. In every revival,
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; there's an Esau and there's a Jacob.
[1:24:27] There's a spiritual and there's a
[1:24:29] carnal. There's one that's loved and
[1:24:30] there's one that hated.
[1:24:35] And in verse 11, the spirit boldly calls
[1:24:37] out for the children not being born,
[1:24:39] neither having done either good or evil,
[1:24:41] that the purpose of God according to
[1:24:43] election might stand. Understand? God
[1:24:46] has a purpose to those who are called by
[1:24:50] election.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; God has a purpose for your life. Why?
[1:24:55] Because he has elected you since before
[1:24:58] the foundations of the world. Amen.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Therefore, let me share this before I
[1:25:03] move on. We had a youth meeting on
[1:25:04] Friday night and we spoke on redeeming
[1:25:06] the time. Understand you have an
[1:25:09] allotted time upon this earth.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; What are you doing with the allotted
[1:25:13] time that God has given you upon this
[1:25:16] earth? What purpose the purpose that God
[1:25:19] has given you while you are here for how
[1:25:22] however many years it may be. How are
[1:25:26] you redeeming the time for the Lord?
[1:25:28] Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; He says that the purpose of God uh
[1:25:35] according to election might stand not of
[1:25:36] works but of him that calleth. This love
[1:25:40] is elective love. So now he's beginning
[1:25:45] to share with us who he loves. And we're
[1:25:50] beginning to find out that God's love is
[1:25:53] an elective love. In other words, he
[1:25:56] chooses who he'll love. and he chooses
[1:25:58] who he won't love. So love, election,
[1:26:01] and predestination are all connected
[1:26:04] together one with another.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; He only loves those who are
[1:26:08] predestinated by the election of God
[1:26:11] from before the foundations of the
[1:26:13] world.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; So does God love everybody? No, he
[1:26:18] doesn't. Who does he love? He loves the
[1:26:21] elected lady.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:27] This is elective love. It is his love
[1:26:29] for his elect and his love for them is
[1:26:32] apart from human merit. For it says that
[1:26:34] the purpose of God stands in election
[1:26:36] which is exactly opposite to works or
[1:26:39] anything man has in himself. Because
[1:26:41] before the children were born, he had
[1:26:43] already said, "Jacob have I loved, but
[1:26:45] Esau have I hated."
[1:26:48] Hallelujah. that makes us feel really
[1:26:52] good. Especially when you're on the
[1:26:55] right side of the coin.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; I got a bunch of scriptures here because
[1:26:59] I just want to clinch the nail. I I want
[1:27:01] to hammer it in and I want to clinch it
[1:27:03] on the election of God.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 31:3, "The Lord hath appeared
[1:27:08] of old unto me, saying, "Yay, I have
[1:27:11] loved thee with an everlasting love.
[1:27:14] Therefore, with loving kindness have I
[1:27:17] drawn thee."
[1:27:18] So he loved the children of Israel by
[1:27:22] appearing onto them. He loved them with
[1:27:25] an everlasting love. Therefore, by his
[1:27:28] loving kindness have I drawn thee. Drawn
[1:27:31] thee is something that we need to pay
[1:27:33] attention to because God's love is
[1:27:36] elective and God's love will draw you
[1:27:39] into his presence. Amen.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:4 according as he has chosen
[1:27:45] us in him before the foundations of the
[1:27:48] world that we should be holy and without
[1:27:49] blame before him in love. Romans 11:5
[1:27:53] Even so then at this present time also
[1:27:56] there is a remnant according to the
[1:27:58] election of grace. 1 Thessalonians 1:es
[1:28:03] 2-4. We give thanks to God always for
[1:28:06] you all, making mention of you in our
[1:28:08] prayers, remembering without ceasing
[1:28:09] your work of faith and labor of love,
[1:28:12] patience of hope in our Lord Jesus
[1:28:14] Christ, in the sight of God and our
[1:28:15] father, knowing brethren, beloved, your
[1:28:19] election
[1:28:21] of God. Amen.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 5:13, "The church that is of
[1:28:26] Babylon, elected together with you,
[1:28:28] saluteth you, and so doth Marcus, my
[1:28:31] son." Are you are you seeing the
[1:28:33] continuity of the scriptures here that
[1:28:35] there is a people that is elected and
[1:28:38] loved of God? And how does he how do we
[1:28:41] know that we are loved of God? Because
[1:28:43] he has elected us. Amen.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Matthew 24 22- 24. And except those days
[1:28:54] should be shortened, there should no
[1:28:56] flesh be saved. But for the elect's
[1:28:58] sake, those days shall be shortened. And
[1:29:01] if any man shall say unto you, lo, here
[1:29:02] is Christ, or there believe it not. For
[1:29:04] there shall arise false Christ, false
[1:29:06] prophets, and show great signs and
[1:29:08] wonders, and so much that if it were
[1:29:10] possible, they shall dise.
[1:29:15] Romans 8:23, who shall lay anything to
[1:29:17] the charge of God's elect? It is God
[1:29:20] that justifies.
[1:29:22] See, God's election is throughout the
[1:29:25] entire Bible, the Old Testament and the
[1:29:29] New Testament. Well, you say, "Well,
[1:29:31] it's not fair. Who are we to tell God
[1:29:34] who he can love and who he cannot love?"
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Matthew 13:es 10-11.
[1:29:44] And the disciples came and said unto
[1:29:46] him, "Why speakest thou unto them in
[1:29:50] parables?" Notice who was who are they
[1:29:53] talking about? They're talking about the
[1:29:56] people outside of the light. Talking
[1:29:59] about the the the Pharisees and the
[1:30:01] Sadducees and and the people around. Why
[1:30:03] do you talk to them in parables? He
[1:30:07] answered and said unto them, "Because it
[1:30:08] is given unto you to know the mysteries
[1:30:10] of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
[1:30:13] is not given
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; to them the love of God is not shown."
[1:30:19] Why? Because they weren't elected
[1:30:22] according to Jacob.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Matthew 11 25 and 26. At that time Jesus
[1:30:32] answered and said, "I thank thee, oh
[1:30:33] Father of heaven and earth, because thou
[1:30:35] has hid these things from the wise and
[1:30:37] prudent, has revealed them unto babes.
[1:30:39] Even so, Father, for so it seemed good
[1:30:43] in thy sight."
[1:30:46] Who is it that opens the blinded eyes to
[1:30:50] the word of the day? It is God. And why
[1:30:53] does God do it? Because his election is
[1:30:57] showing forth his love. And what does he
[1:31:00] do to those who he loves? He reveals
[1:31:04] himself. He appears to them and he
[1:31:06] reveals himself who he is in the hour in
[1:31:10] which they're living in. That's the love
[1:31:12] of God.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; For it seemed good in thy sight.
[1:31:21] It's good in the sight of the father to
[1:31:25] reveal to you his words. It's good in
[1:31:29] the sight of the father to reveal to his
[1:31:32] elect lady the light of the scripture
[1:31:36] and the hour in which we're living in.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; After his resurrection, Jesus only
[1:31:42] revealed himself and made himself known
[1:31:45] to his elected lady. And he's doing the
[1:31:48] exact same thing in this day and in this
[1:31:51] hour in which we're living in. Because
[1:31:54] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and
[1:31:57] today and forever.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Does he love everybody? No. How does he
[1:32:04] show forth his love? First of all, it's
[1:32:06] an elective love. How do I know if I've
[1:32:09] been elected by God? When God opens the
[1:32:13] understanding and enlightens your eyes
[1:32:16] with the Isel of the Holy Spirit
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; and he opens his word to you and he
[1:32:22] makes himself known onto you and he
[1:32:25] appears onto you through the spoken word
[1:32:27] of this day is the very love of God
[1:32:31] projected to you today.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Brother Bradom said that
[1:32:35] Jesus was the projection the how God
[1:32:39] projected his love to the world. Not
[1:32:42] just by sending Jesus to the world but
[1:32:45] by opening the understanding of the
[1:32:48] disciples eyes of who Jesus really was.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood has not revealed this
[1:32:54] unto you. But my father who is in heaven
[1:32:57] has revealed this onto you. He has
[1:32:59] opened your eyes, the eyes of your
[1:33:01] understanding. He has given you a a
[1:33:03] heart to receive.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; He's no different in this day. The
[1:33:10] appearing that we've had in this hour,
[1:33:12] the appearing is one thing cuz many saw
[1:33:15] the appearing of the son of man, but
[1:33:18] they didn't understand it. It's one
[1:33:21] thing to see the appearing, but it's
[1:33:24] another thing to understand the mystery
[1:33:28] behind the appearing. Right?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; What good is it to under to see and the
[1:33:33] appearing and to see the great signs and
[1:33:36] wonders if you don't catch the mystery
[1:33:39] behind what's hidden behind flesh. The
[1:33:43] mystery that's hidden behind the
[1:33:45] appearing.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; It's pointless.
[1:33:50] It's actually judgment
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; because you see his appearing but you
[1:33:55] you miss the mystery behind the
[1:33:58] appearing. So to one it is to one it is
[1:34:02] it is salvation
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; but to another it's rejection to one
[1:34:08] it's salvation to another one it is
[1:34:11] rejection to one it is life. But to
[1:34:14] reject life is death.
[1:34:20] God shows his love by appearing and
[1:34:24] through this appearing revealing himself
[1:34:28] to his elected.
[1:34:30] Not only does he appear but he reveals
[1:34:34] the mystery behind the appearing
[1:34:39] the pillar of fire in the cloud in the
[1:34:41] Old Testament. It was it was a sign to
[1:34:44] Israel that God was with them. that God
[1:34:47] was leading them through uh from Egypt
[1:34:50] through the wilderness, that God was
[1:34:52] with them, that God was taking care of
[1:34:54] them. They had a a cloud by day and a
[1:34:56] and a pillar of fire by night. And and
[1:34:59] they were they were not only symbols,
[1:35:02] but it was it was God himself that was
[1:35:05] dwelling in the fire. It was God himself
[1:35:08] who was dwelling in the cloud. and he
[1:35:11] himself was leading his people through a
[1:35:15] vindicated prophet.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; So it wasn't just a pillar or a fire and
[1:35:21] it wasn't just a cloud, but it was
[1:35:23] actually God himself.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire returned to the earth
[1:35:33] to lead God's people at Pentecost. Here
[1:35:37] was this clove and tongues of fire and
[1:35:40] it and it and it and it and it hovered
[1:35:42] over the people and and and Peter once
[1:35:46] this full conversion had taken place. My
[1:35:49] goodness, you talk about the power and
[1:35:52] you talk about demonstration of the word
[1:35:55] indeed not just in word but in but in
[1:35:57] demonstration.
[1:35:59] And so here was this God Jesus Christ
[1:36:03] who was the logos and came down from God
[1:36:06] dwelt in a body. Now he went back to
[1:36:08] this pillar of fire again. It was the
[1:36:11] same the same pillar of fire that was
[1:36:14] leading the children of Israel from
[1:36:16] Egypt to the promised land.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; And so now here's Paul and he's thinking
[1:36:21] he's doing a really good thing. He's
[1:36:24] he's going after the believers and he's
[1:36:26] and he's doing this and he's throwing
[1:36:27] this one in jail and he's holding the
[1:36:29] coat of those who stoned Stephen and he
[1:36:32] thinks I'm going to get rid of these
[1:36:33] heresies and I'm going to get rid of
[1:36:35] these guys cuz how dare they come up
[1:36:37] against the Sanhedrin and so on and so
[1:36:39] forth. All of a sudden there's a light
[1:36:42] pillar of fire in the sky
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; and it blinds his eyes.
[1:36:47] He says, "Saul, Saul, why are you
[1:36:49] persecuting me?" He says, "Lord,
[1:36:53] who are you?
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Tell me your name.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; I know this pillar of fire.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; I know it's you, Lord. I know it's
[1:37:02] Adoni. I know it's Elohim." Whatever
[1:37:04] name you want to give him, I know it's
[1:37:06] you. What is your name? He says, "I am
[1:37:09] Jesus.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; I am Jesus." You see, Jehovah of the Old
[1:37:14] Testament became Jesus of the New
[1:37:16] Testament. So now all of a sudden this
[1:37:19] this this this pillar of fire now which
[1:37:23] which was once once led Israel in the
[1:37:25] Old Testament is now in the New
[1:37:27] Testament church.
[1:37:30] And what's the purpose of it? The same
[1:37:32] as it was from Egypt to the promise to
[1:37:34] lead his people.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; What is the pillar of fire for? What is
[1:37:39] the Holy Ghost for? Let me say this.
[1:37:41] It's more than a sensation. It's more
[1:37:44] than a feeling. But it's the divine. He
[1:37:46] is the divine revealer of the word.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; And without the divine revealer of the
[1:37:53] holy word of the word within our hearts,
[1:37:55] there's no way to understand the word.
[1:37:58] That's why a confession isn't good
[1:38:00] enough. But a complete conversion.
[1:38:08] So now we see that the pillar of fire
[1:38:11] returned back then but there was never
[1:38:13] no mention of the cloud.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Where did the cloud go? If we are to be
[1:38:19] led by a pillar of fire and a cloud just
[1:38:23] like because brother Brandham preaches
[1:38:24] Israel in the church and he makes the
[1:38:27] parallel between Israel and us. how they
[1:38:30] came out of Egypt, how we come out of
[1:38:32] the world, how we're we're we're we're
[1:38:34] on a journey to a promised land that has
[1:38:36] been promised to the the the the the
[1:38:39] seed of the faith seed of Abraham.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; We're on a journey. We've seen the
[1:38:45] pillar of fire,
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; but where's the cloud?
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Where's the cloud been through seven
[1:38:51] church ages? Where was the cloud with
[1:38:55] Martin Luther? Where was it with with
[1:38:57] John Wesley? Where where was it? If
[1:39:00] we're to be led by a a cloud and and by
[1:39:03] the pillar of fire, where is the cloud?
[1:39:07] It's been returned to us.
[1:39:10] God waited
[1:39:12] throughout seven church ages. And at the
[1:39:15] very end of the seventh church age, now
[1:39:18] he says, "I am going to unite the pillar
[1:39:20] and cloud once again." Why is he doing
[1:39:23] it? He's doing it to lead his people.
[1:39:27] So, here's brother Brandham and and you
[1:39:30] all know the story and he's he's he's
[1:39:32] wondering what this all means and he
[1:39:34] doesn't understand it. I want to tell
[1:39:36] you it's more than just a cloud.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; It is more than just a picture. It is
[1:39:42] more than just angels with a revelation.
[1:39:45] But it's the very mind and presence of
[1:39:47] God back upon the earth again for what
[1:39:50] purpose? To lead his people.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:56] The purpose of the cloud and the fire is
[1:39:58] is to lead his people to the promised
[1:40:02] land.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Therefore, everything that was contained
[1:40:05] within this cloud is needful for you and
[1:40:08] I in this day in which we're living in.
[1:40:11] Because without the cloud, without the
[1:40:14] very mind of God being revealed to us,
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; we don't have the perfect leadership of
[1:40:21] God.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:25] You say, "All we need, brother, is the
[1:40:28] Holy Ghost."
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; We just need the Holy Ghost and it'll
[1:40:32] teach you all things. Not true. You need
[1:40:35] a prophet.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; You need a prophet with the mind of God
[1:40:39] who's going to teach you these things,
[1:40:41] who's going to show you how to live your
[1:40:43] life, who's going to reveal to you the
[1:40:45] mysteries that have been hidden within
[1:40:47] this book, that we may know how to get
[1:40:50] ready for a rapture.
[1:40:54] Why do we need the cloud? And why is it
[1:40:58] so important? Because it is God's
[1:41:01] headship and leadership guiding the
[1:41:04] church to their promised land.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; So we should never say one to another
[1:41:11] that it's not important.
[1:41:13] We should never say one to another that
[1:41:16] it's not needed. We should never say one
[1:41:18] to another. It's just a story or it's
[1:41:21] just a picture.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; It is God's leadership for his chosen
[1:41:27] elected lady.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well,
[1:41:35] did you know that a pastor couldn't
[1:41:39] preach the seven seals with the
[1:41:41] revelation of it?
[1:41:43] Teacher couldn't have done it. An
[1:41:46] evangelist couldn't have done it.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; It had to be a prophet
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; because the word of the Lord comes to
[1:41:54] the prophet.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; And so, let me say this that as a
[1:41:59] minister of the gospel, I have nothing
[1:42:01] more to add to the revelation that has
[1:42:04] already been given by that prophet
[1:42:07] messenger. I will gain more revelation
[1:42:11] as we walk in the light, but I will not
[1:42:13] add any more revelation to it because
[1:42:16] nothing can be added to it and nothing
[1:42:19] should be taken away from it.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Notice this. Revelations 10:7. But in
[1:42:27] the vo in the days of the voice of the
[1:42:29] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[1:42:31] sound, the mystery of God should be
[1:42:33] finished as he has declared to his
[1:42:35] servants the prophets. God was a mystery
[1:42:38] until the sounding forth of this seventh
[1:42:41] church age messenger. But because the
[1:42:43] book has become opened by the loosing or
[1:42:46] the breaking of these seals, God and his
[1:42:49] complete plan of redemption is no more a
[1:42:53] mystery. But now we understand the plan
[1:42:56] of redemption that God has given us in
[1:42:59] this day and in this hour.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; God is no longer a mystery.
[1:43:05] We should be able to understand God.
[1:43:08] Why? Because the book has become open.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; The mysteries have become unfolded.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; There is no longer a mystery between the
[1:43:17] bride
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; and God.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; The mystery is this now is Christ in
[1:43:24] you,
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; The mystery was once held within a book.
[1:43:34] And the book was sealed. But now the
[1:43:36] book is open
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; and now the mysteries have unfolded. But
[1:43:40] let me ask you a question. What is a
[1:43:43] book?
[1:43:45] A book is quite simply a collection of
[1:43:47] words.
[1:43:50] It's a collection of word. So now where
[1:43:54] is the mystery?
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; The mystery lays within the word.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; The book.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:05] Within this book,
[1:44:07] there was seven thunders.
[1:44:09] And the seven thunders, they had a
[1:44:11] voice.
[1:44:13] And John heard these thunders. He heard
[1:44:15] the voice. And he was he was about to
[1:44:18] write what they were saying because John
[1:44:20] understood what the voice was saying. He
[1:44:23] understood what the thunders were. And
[1:44:25] when he was beginning to write what
[1:44:27] these mysteries were that were hidden
[1:44:29] underneath these seals, these seven
[1:44:31] thunders, the voice told him and said,
[1:44:33] "Hey, John, write it not.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; I know you understand it." You see, the
[1:44:38] understanding is for the bride.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; I know you understand it. I know you
[1:44:42] heard it, but this can't be something
[1:44:44] that is written. This is a hidden uh uh
[1:44:48] this is a hidden mystery that has to be
[1:44:52] revealed by me personally.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham said those
[1:44:57] seven thunders are being manifested
[1:45:00] that's not even written within the
[1:45:02] scripture.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; He was forbidden to write it. But though
[1:45:05] it wasn't written, the mystery is there.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; And so now the mystery is divinely given
[1:45:12] by God himself.
[1:45:15] Yeah,
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; if it's not written, how how can you try
[1:45:19] to figure it out with a carnal mind?
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; You can't do it. That's why it's a
[1:45:25] divinely revealed truth.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Once these seals were loosed,
[1:45:35] it loosed these thundering voices that
[1:45:38] wasn't even permitted to be written. The
[1:45:42] seals had the thunders closed up.
[1:45:46] It had them covered. It had them sealed.
[1:45:48] These the the mysteries of these
[1:45:50] thunders were sealed up by these seven
[1:45:52] seals. But when they were broken and the
[1:45:55] word became a new book and it became an
[1:45:58] open book, what what made it a new book?
[1:46:01] It was the revelation of the thunders.
[1:46:05] That's what made it a new book. And so
[1:46:08] that's why revelation is personally
[1:46:10] given to us by God.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10 1-4. And I saw another
[1:46:18] mighty angel come down from heaven
[1:46:19] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow above
[1:46:21] his upon his head. And his face was as
[1:46:23] it were the sun, and his feet as pillars
[1:46:25] of fire. And he had in his hand a little
[1:46:27] book open. And he set his right foot on
[1:46:28] the sea and his left upon the earth. And
[1:46:30] he cried with a loud voice as when a
[1:46:32] lion roar. And when he had cried, seven
[1:46:34] thunders uttered their voices. They said
[1:46:36] something.
[1:46:38] And when the seven thunders had uttered
[1:46:39] their voice, I was about to write and I
[1:46:41] heard a voice from heaven saying unto
[1:46:42] me, "Seal up those things which the
[1:46:44] seven thunders uttered and write them
[1:46:46] not." Understand it wasn't to be given
[1:46:48] for everybody,
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; but it is given to the elect of God.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Questions and answers 1964. This is a
[1:46:58] question. Have the seven thunders which
[1:47:00] equal seven mysteries already been
[1:47:02] revealed. Were they revealed in the
[1:47:04] seven seals, but are yet not known to us
[1:47:07] as the thunders yet? No, they were
[1:47:10] revealed in the seven seals. That's what
[1:47:13] the thunders was about. The seven
[1:47:15] thunders that had uttered their voices,
[1:47:16] and no one could make out what it was.
[1:47:19] John knew what it was, but he was
[1:47:21] forbidden to write it. But the seventh
[1:47:23] angel in the days of his sounding, the
[1:47:25] seven mysteries of the seven thunders
[1:47:27] would be revealed. And the seventh angel
[1:47:30] is a messenger of the seventh church age
[1:47:32] sea. So what is he he's he's telling the
[1:47:35] people that it's not something that you
[1:47:37] have to wait for, but it's something
[1:47:39] that is already being revealed. Say,
[1:47:41] "Brother Stephen, why are you sharing
[1:47:44] this?" Because this is the love of God.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; It's the love of God to you personally
[1:47:49] when he opens the book to you and he
[1:47:52] reveals to you those mysterious thunders
[1:47:54] that were hidden um underneath those
[1:47:57] seven seals.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Hidden for seven church ages. Now these
[1:48:02] last times have been revealed to you and
[1:48:05] I, his elect lady.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; You talk about love.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; So how do we how do we understand
[1:48:21] God's love toward us?
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Because remember, if you don't
[1:48:27] understand God's love, you're going to
[1:48:28] think he doesn't love you.
[1:48:31] So, how do we know that God loves us?
[1:48:34] It's because he has opened our eyes.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; And he has given us an understanding of
[1:48:40] the truth in this day of things that
[1:48:42] were once mysterious,
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; but now are being plainly made known
[1:48:49] under the loosening of the seven seals.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; What love.
[1:49:00] that he kept it for all this time
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; and he kept you all this time in the
[1:49:06] back part of his mind until it was the
[1:49:08] time for you to come forth and to
[1:49:10] manifest his word. And how can you
[1:49:14] manifest his word if it's not revealed
[1:49:17] to you? Amen.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; So what God does is he says I want you
[1:49:22] at this end time in Leodysia to be in
[1:49:24] this church age at this specific time
[1:49:26] because I have a purpose of you because
[1:49:29] of election and predestination. And I
[1:49:32] want you to live a life that is
[1:49:34] manifesting these seven mysterious
[1:49:37] thunders will not understand but you
[1:49:40] will understand it.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; The love of God. You see, he wants you
[1:49:45] to manifest something. Therefore, God
[1:49:48] makes a way for you to manifest it.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; That's what love is.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; God does not expect us to manifest
[1:49:56] something without making a way for us to
[1:49:58] do it.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; And so it is. We can't expect something
[1:50:01] from one another, from our children,
[1:50:03] from our family members, as the heads of
[1:50:06] the house, if we don't make a way for it
[1:50:08] to happen.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; That's love.
[1:50:13] How can you expect
[1:50:15] your children to mow the lawn if you
[1:50:18] never teach them?
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; You expect them to do something, they
[1:50:23] don't do it right, and they get
[1:50:24] corrected.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Is that good or evil?
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; It's evil.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Why is it evil? Because you wanted
[1:50:33] something to happen, but you didn't make
[1:50:34] a way for it to happen.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; It's called setting him up to fail.
[1:50:43] in the Leodysian church age talking
[1:50:45] about God's love. And I'm I'm going to
[1:50:48] wind down here. Stick with me. And now
[1:50:50] he says to his own, "As many as I love,
[1:50:53] I rebuke and chasen."
[1:50:56] Notice his love. And you all know this.
[1:50:59] His love is to rebuke and it's to
[1:51:01] chasen.
[1:51:02] The love of God. Don't misunderstand
[1:51:06] God's love. His love is to rebuke and
[1:51:09] his love is to chasen and his love is to
[1:51:13] reveal to his elected lady. So if God
[1:51:16] has revealed the word for this day to
[1:51:18] you in your heart, it's a certain fact
[1:51:21] that God is showing to you that he loves
[1:51:23] you.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; To rebuke is to reprove. To reprove is
[1:51:30] to expose with the with a view of
[1:51:33] correction.
[1:51:34] Chasen does not mean to punish. It means
[1:51:37] to discipline because the subject's
[1:51:39] amendment is in mind.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; This one really that that part of the
[1:51:43] quote that really stood out to me
[1:51:46] because you all know we are in the
[1:51:48] corrective years of of of life with
[1:51:52] children.
[1:51:55] Chasing does not mean to punish.
[1:51:58] I wonder how many times you and I have
[1:52:03] corrected and we have chasened
[1:52:06] our children for punishment.
[1:52:11] Punishment, you know, punishment is
[1:52:14] something that that you do to a
[1:52:16] criminal.
[1:52:18] You know what happens to criminals when
[1:52:20] they're in jail, in prison or or stuff
[1:52:22] like that? They get hardened.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Their hearts get hardened. Their spirits
[1:52:27] get hardened. They get hatred in their
[1:52:29] life. They get animosity. They get all
[1:52:32] these different things. Why? Because
[1:52:34] they're being they're being punished.
[1:52:36] And and the punishment, you know, the
[1:52:39] jails and everything, they think, well,
[1:52:40] if we just punish them enough, you know,
[1:52:42] they'll get right. It's not true. A lot
[1:52:45] of people go to jail punished and they
[1:52:47] come out worse.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; It hardens a heart. It hardens a life.
[1:52:52] It it it it makes a a heart stony.
[1:52:56] and in their mind they're thinking, "I'm
[1:52:57] being punished for this." Do you like
[1:52:59] anybody that punishes you?
[1:53:03] Do you like a ministry that you ever
[1:53:06] have you ever heard a sermon or a
[1:53:08] ministry that punishes the people for
[1:53:10] doing wrong?
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; I'm going to punish you. And because
[1:53:14] thou didest this, you are punished from
[1:53:17] this time forth. God help us.
[1:53:21] The purpose of chastening is not for
[1:53:24] punishment in the eyes of God,
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; but the discipline because the subject's
[1:53:29] amendment is in mind. So in other words,
[1:53:32] God has uh uh an end result that he's
[1:53:37] trying to bring us to. He has he has a
[1:53:40] start here and we go through this
[1:53:42] journey of life, but he's really wanting
[1:53:44] to bring us over here. And and the
[1:53:47] reason for the chastening and the reason
[1:53:48] for the correction along the journey is
[1:53:51] because he wants us to have the right
[1:53:53] kind of character when it comes time
[1:53:55] over here that we would receive a body
[1:53:57] change cuz the only thing that we're
[1:53:59] going to take with us is our character.
[1:54:02] So God has an end an end view in mind
[1:54:05] for you and I. And the chastening is not
[1:54:08] for punishment. It's not because he
[1:54:10] hates you. It's not it's not anything
[1:54:12] like that. It's because it's his love
[1:54:14] that he has an end plan for you to get
[1:54:17] to make it over here.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; So now as fathers and as mothers, we
[1:54:24] should take this same chastening
[1:54:27] and we oughten to be chasening our kids
[1:54:30] and our children for punishment's sake
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; because it's for punishment. It's going
[1:54:36] to be taken the wrong way.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; It's going to be taken. is going to give
[1:54:41] a hardened neck, a hardened heart.
[1:54:44] They're going to think you don't love
[1:54:45] them. So on and so forth. Why? Because
[1:54:47] there's a difference in punishment. And
[1:54:50] I'm doing this to teach you a lesson
[1:54:52] because I want you to come out on the
[1:54:54] other side as a good, moral human being
[1:54:58] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; It's not for punishment.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; And so we shouldn't punish one another.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; It's amazing, isn't it?
[1:55:10] This is exactly what we find in Hebrews
[1:55:12] 12:5-11. And ye have forgotten the
[1:55:15] exhortation which speakest unto you as
[1:55:18] unto children. My son despise thou not
[1:55:20] despise not thou the chastening of the
[1:55:22] Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of
[1:55:24] him. For whom the Lord loveth, he
[1:55:26] chastineth. Look at that. Who he loves,
[1:55:28] he chastens and chastens and scorgth.
[1:55:31] Every son who whom he receiveth. If he
[1:55:34] if he endure chastening, God dealeth
[1:55:36] with you as with sons. For what son is
[1:55:40] he whom the father chastens not? But if
[1:55:42] ye be without chastisement, whereof all
[1:55:44] are partakers, then your bastards, and
[1:55:46] not sons. Furthermore, we have had
[1:55:49] fathers of our flesh, which corrected
[1:55:50] us, and we gave them reverence. Shall we
[1:55:52] not much rather be in subjection unto
[1:55:54] the father of spirits and live? For they
[1:55:57] verily for a few days chasened us after
[1:55:59] their own pleasure, but he for our
[1:56:02] profit. So why does God chasen us and
[1:56:04] rebuke us? It's for our profit. It's for
[1:56:07] our good. It's actually the love of God
[1:56:11] towards you.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Don't understand, misunderstand the love
[1:56:17] of God.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; When you receive chastening and rebuking
[1:56:23] and so on and so forth. It is the very
[1:56:26] love of God himself.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Now, no chastening for the present
[1:56:33] seemth to be joyous but grievious.
[1:56:36] Nevertheless, afterward it yieldth the
[1:56:37] peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[1:56:39] them which are exercised thereby. Herein
[1:56:41] is now set forth the love of God.
[1:56:44] Everybody listen. He desired in love a
[1:56:46] family of his own, a family of sons,
[1:56:49] sons like himself, sons and daughters.
[1:56:51] There before him lies all mankind as one
[1:56:54] lump of clay. Out of that lump he will
[1:56:57] now make vessels unto honor and unto
[1:56:59] dishonor. The choosing will be his own
[1:57:02] choosing. Then those chosen ones born of
[1:57:04] his spirit will be trained to conform to
[1:57:08] his image and their walk.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; So what is God expecting from us from
[1:57:14] all of the things that we go through
[1:57:16] that we would be conformed in our walk
[1:57:20] with him?
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; It's all about our daily lives.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; He repro reproves with all longsuffering
[1:57:29] and gentleness and mercy. He chasens
[1:57:31] with nail scarred hands. Sometimes his
[1:57:34] potter must take the vessel he's working
[1:57:35] on and thoroughly break it down in order
[1:57:37] that he may rebuild it exactly as he
[1:57:41] desires it. But it is love.
[1:57:45] That is his love. Another way of his
[1:57:49] love there is not there cannot be.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; My
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; as the musicians would come we'll bring
[1:57:58] this to a close.
[1:58:00] So let's summarize our sermon
[1:58:05] and let's ask ourselves what is the love
[1:58:09] of God.
[1:58:11] First off the love of God is elective
[1:58:14] love. He takes a whole lump and out of
[1:58:18] that lump he chooses Esau's and he
[1:58:20] chooses Jacob's. He chooses vessels onto
[1:58:23] honor. He chooses vessels onto dishonor.
[1:58:25] And this choosing is his own choosing.
[1:58:28] And it is it is his way of showing his
[1:58:31] love towards you who are elected.
[1:58:36] And not only does he elect those people,
[1:58:39] but now he appears onto them and he
[1:58:43] reveals himself as a mystery under the
[1:58:46] appearing. Because there's many people
[1:58:48] that see the appearing and they see the
[1:58:51] signs and they see the wonders, but they
[1:58:54] miss the mystery of God underneath the
[1:58:57] appearing. But his love to his elect,
[1:59:00] what does he do? He reveals it to you.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Why has God revealed himself to you in
[1:59:09] this day? I'll tell you why. because
[1:59:13] there is a scripture that must be
[1:59:15] fulfilled. That in a moment, in the
[1:59:17] twinkling of an eye, your bodies shall
[1:59:20] be changed. That there would be a shout,
[1:59:22] there'd be a voice, there'd be the trump
[1:59:24] of God, and these things would all
[1:59:26] happen as he was descending. But there
[1:59:28] would be a people upon earth that would
[1:59:31] recognize this appearing, that would
[1:59:33] recognize this coming. And underneath
[1:59:36] that mystery now, they would begin to
[1:59:39] prepare their lives according to the
[1:59:42] word that came out of the cloud that's
[1:59:44] leading the people to the promised land.
[1:59:47] According to that word, now the people
[1:59:49] would live a life. They would walk
[1:59:52] through tragedies. They would walk
[1:59:53] through uh things that were not
[1:59:56] pleasant. They would walk through
[1:59:57] rebukings and chastisements from God.
[2:00:00] But they would come to a certain place
[2:00:02] where a scripture would be fulfilled.
[2:00:05] That somebody would not taste of death,
[2:00:07] but they would go to meet the Lord in
[2:00:09] the air.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; That this vessel of impurity would take
[2:00:15] on purity. That this earthly tabernacle
[2:00:19] would put on a a glorious and a heavenly
[2:00:22] tabernacle. These are scriptures that
[2:00:25] are going to be fulfilled by somebody.
[2:00:27] And it's going to be fulfilled by the
[2:00:29] elect of God in this hour.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Understand, we are not looking for more
[2:00:38] signs and wonders.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Those signs follow the believers. We
[2:00:42] believe that. But we're not looking for
[2:00:44] someone to rise up with a great ministry
[2:00:47] and great signs and great wonders. We
[2:00:50] are not looking for brother Brandham to
[2:00:52] return and to fulfill his ministry. His
[2:00:55] ministry has already been fulfilled. And
[2:00:58] let me say this, it was fulfilled
[2:01:00] perfectly.
[2:01:03] [Music]
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham turned his back to the
[2:01:06] people,
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Gentile people. He said, "You're
[2:01:10] receiving your last sign.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; There's no more signs that are to be
[2:01:15] given to the Gentiles." The last The
[2:01:17] last thing that is to happen, the last
[2:01:20] thing that we're looking for and
[2:01:21] watching for is the coming of the Lord.
[2:01:24] Amen.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; There's coming a day
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; when the body of Jesus Christ that lays
[2:01:31] upon the altar of sacrifice right now as
[2:01:34] we speak.
[2:01:36] There's coming a day where that body is
[2:01:39] going to come and he's going to step off
[2:01:42] the altar of sacrifice. And he's going
[2:01:44] to come to earth and he's going to come
[2:01:47] and he's going to receive a people. He's
[2:01:50] going to step forth to claim those who
[2:01:54] he has redeemed and purchased by his
[2:01:57] blood.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; He steps forth. Where's my claim?
[2:02:06] I'm watching. I'm waiting, Lord.
[2:02:10] I'm I'm following your leadership by the
[2:02:12] pillar of fire in my heart and by this
[2:02:15] cloud that you've given us to lead us in
[2:02:18] the truth of your word.
[2:02:20] Where is my claim that I have redeemed
[2:02:23] with a price?
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; I'm right here.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; I'm watching. I'm waiting. I'm under
[2:02:28] anticipation. I'm not looking for
[2:02:30] anything else. I'm not looking for
[2:02:32] signs. I'm not looking for wonders. I'm
[2:02:35] looking for him to come and to claim me
[2:02:37] as my own.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:39] Hallelujah.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; You remember as it comes to me, you
[2:02:45] remember uh the the the the story that
[2:02:49] brother Brandham tells of the little
[2:02:50] dishwasher woman and he talks of her.
[2:02:53] She and and and and she her parents
[2:02:56] died. It almost sounds like Cinderella,
[2:02:58] the story that he tells. and and one of
[2:03:02] the people that owned the ranch or
[2:03:03] whatever, one of the sons was was coming
[2:03:06] and looking for a wife and and all of
[2:03:08] the girls of the city, they were all,
[2:03:09] "Oh, it's going to be me and it's going
[2:03:11] to be me." And they're all getting all
[2:03:12] dressed up and and here's this little
[2:03:15] it's a cousin. I'll call her a little
[2:03:17] washer woman. She would wash the clothes
[2:03:19] and clean the floor and do all these
[2:03:20] things. She didn't have nice clothes.
[2:03:24] She wasn't She didn't have the the the
[2:03:26] pretty hair and the pretty necklaces and
[2:03:28] all these things. No, she didn't have an
[2:03:30] outward beauty like that, but she had a
[2:03:32] character. She had a beauty within her,
[2:03:34] a certain character and beauty that this
[2:03:36] man was looking for. So, while everybody
[2:03:38] else was flirting with him and and and
[2:03:40] trying to get his attention, here she
[2:03:42] was busy working
[2:03:45] and he waits for her outside
[2:03:48] and she walks out and she sees him and
[2:03:52] she's embarrassed.
[2:03:54] Look at me,
[2:03:56] man. I'm all dirty and raggedy and no
[2:03:59] doubt her hair her bun was messy and
[2:04:03] she was cleaning. But he saw something
[2:04:06] in her that nobody else saw. And he
[2:04:10] said, "You know, I've come here to look
[2:04:12] for a wife and so on and so forth." They
[2:04:14] converse and he says, "Will you marry
[2:04:16] me?
[2:04:18] Me? Marry you?
[2:04:22] Look at me."
[2:04:24] You ever looked at yourself
[2:04:27] in the presence of God?
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Look at me, man. I'm so dirty. Got these
[2:04:36] raggedy clothes on. My hair don't look
[2:04:38] nice. I
[2:04:41] How can he love me?
[2:04:44] He's not coming for beauty of the world.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:49] But he started your journey here and he
[2:04:52] chasens and he rebukes you along here
[2:04:54] with his tender hand and love and he
[2:04:57] reveals himself to you and all of a
[2:04:59] sudden you come out here on this other
[2:05:00] side and and you still look raggedy.
[2:05:04] Your flesh man is always going to look
[2:05:06] raggedy.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Is always going to look unclean. It's
[2:05:09] always always going to look like a
[2:05:10] dishwasher boy or a dishwasher girl when
[2:05:14] you compare yourself to the world. But
[2:05:16] he's not looking at that. He's looking
[2:05:18] at the character that was forged through
[2:05:21] the fire of tribulations. And all of a
[2:05:24] sudden, you come here and you're like,
[2:05:25] "Wow, you want to marry me?"
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; You hear his message. You hear his word.
[2:05:31] And you accept it.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Yes,
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; I'll marry you.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; I'll be yours if you'll take me."
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; How I am,
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; but I promise I won't stay as I am. But
[2:05:45] I'll walk in your word.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. and I'll change and I'll listen to
[2:05:48] your voice and I'll listen to your
[2:05:50] message and I'll prepare myself. And he
[2:05:53] says, "A year from today, I'm going to
[2:05:55] come back and I'm going to get you."
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; So for a year,
[2:06:00] she plans
[2:06:02] and she gets ready and she's dressing
[2:06:05] herself every day
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; in the word.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; She heard his voice. Amen. Amen.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; She
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; she saw and she understood the mystery
[2:06:15] underneath the thunders that the reason
[2:06:17] for it is quite simply this to prepare a
[2:06:20] people
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; for a prepared place. And she recognized
[2:06:24] it. She understood it. She had a
[2:06:26] revelation of it. And it didn't matter
[2:06:27] what anybody else said or done and
[2:06:30] teased her about what she believed or
[2:06:32] the voice that she heard or the
[2:06:33] understanding that she has. She said,
[2:06:35] "I'm going to prepare because he's
[2:06:37] coming back for me because he promised
[2:06:41] me."
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; My We put oursel in her shoes and we
[2:06:50] think, "Lord,
[2:06:53] here I am."
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; You know, I need your help. I need your
[2:06:58] wisdom and I need your guidance and I
[2:07:02] need that inner voice, the Holy Ghost to
[2:07:05] reveal to me
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; the mystery of how I should live my life
[2:07:11] that Lord, when you step forth from the
[2:07:14] altar of sacrifice
[2:07:16] and you come to claim me, the purchased,
[2:07:19] the redeemed, the purchased of your
[2:07:22] blood, I'll be right here
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; and I'll be watching y
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; and I'll be ready, Lord. Lord, how many
[2:07:29] of you say, "I'm watching and I'm
[2:07:31] waiting."
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; I ain't looking for something
[2:07:34] spectacular, an everyday simple life,
[2:07:37] living for Christ Jesus, applying the
[2:07:39] word to my life. I know that whenever he
[2:07:42] steps forth, I'll be watching. I'll be
[2:07:44] waiting and I'll be ready. And if I'm
[2:07:47] ready, I know that I'll meet him in the
[2:07:50] air. Why? Because he promised it to me.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:56] And so all of a sudden the bride goes up
[2:08:00] representation of the blood and all hell
[2:08:03] breaks loose on earth.
[2:08:06] I'm so thankful
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; for the promise of God in this day.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; A promise that he is taking my heart
[2:08:16] back to the original faith of the
[2:08:18] Pentecostal fathers. that the alpha now
[2:08:22] is meeting the omega now is meeting the
[2:08:25] alpha and they are becoming one and then
[2:08:28] when he comes we shall we shall know him
[2:08:31] for we shall be like him and we shall be
[2:08:35] as he is. Amen. Let's stand together.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Your love is life
[2:08:45] to me.
[2:08:49] My truest longing mighty deepest
[2:08:58] without you. One moment
[2:09:02] I don't know where I'd be.
[2:09:07] Cuz your love is life
[2:09:10] to me.
[2:09:15] Your love is life
[2:09:19] to me.
[2:09:22] My trueest longing, my deepest
[2:09:27] need.
[2:09:31] Without you one moment,
[2:09:35] I don't know where I'd be.
[2:09:40] Your love is life.
[2:09:44] Sing it again.
[2:09:48] Your love is life
[2:09:52] to me.
[2:09:55] My trueest longing my deepest
[2:10:00] me.
[2:10:04] Without you one moment
[2:10:08] I don't know where I'd be.
[2:10:13] Your love is life
[2:10:16] to me.
[2:10:18] [Music]
[2:10:20] I have a maker
[2:10:28] before
[2:10:30] my heart.
[2:10:33] Before
[2:10:36] [Music]
[2:10:38] even time began,
[2:10:42] my life
[2:10:44] was in his hand.
[2:10:52] He knows
[2:10:54] my name.
[2:11:00] He knows
[2:11:02] my every thought.
[2:11:07] He sees
[2:11:10] each tear that falls
[2:11:14] and hears me when I call.
[2:11:23] I have a father.
[2:11:31] He calls me his own.
[2:11:39] He'll never
[2:11:42] leave me
[2:11:45] no matter
[2:11:47] where I go.
[2:11:54] He knows
[2:11:56] my name.
[2:12:02] He knows
[2:12:04] my every thought.
