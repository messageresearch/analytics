pastor and wish him Ste recovery may the Lord be with us as we open to the book of uh numbers Numbers Chapter 13 and also to read from the book of Isaiah 45 so let's read from numbers 13 say some few things to encourage ourselves this evening let's from verse 27 and they told him and said we came onto the land whether thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and fr and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that D in the land and the cities are W and very great moreover we saw the children of anak there the amalekites dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and Caleb steal the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it amen but the man that went up with him said we be not able to go against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had SE unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we had gone to set it is a land that eated up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it were men of great stature and there we saw the GI Giants the sons of anak which came of the Giants and we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we were in their sight amen let's read from Isaiah chapter 45 Isaiah 45:22 look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else amen amen may the Lord bless his word amen shall be seated praise the Lord hallelujah so we are grateful again to be in the house of the Lord and we are thankful to the Lord for all that he's doing in our lives amen and uh I'm also thankful to almighty God that I am standing here this evening and behind the sacri vest last year by this time I was very sick I had surgery and prostrate surgery cancer and uh it was very tough last year by this time I was wearing ceter I could not even PE for 9 months I was wearing C before I left Ghana to come to the US I was I was so much in pain that I've been to the doctors and they check me and they said oh your prostrate has become too big and uh I did different test and then the doctor said um and there is cancer in this spot and okay but don't have to worry just I said no I was not worried because when he just mentioned cancer the only thing that came to me do you fear cancer I remember what the prophet thought and then he told us there is no virtue in fear so I didn't fear because there is no virtue in it right and then I have to take a lot of pain medications and oh for sleepless night I was M weeks I was I was not sleeping day I was not sleeping it was just unbearable until some of the brothers got to hear about it but very coffee and the rest and they said no brother Timothy if you can travel out just leave and come we have doctors here that can help we do what we can do so I flew to the US and then uh I after to I thought I was just going to camp and then I stay 9 months here and uh by this time last year I was I've just had a surgy the surgy was in November yeah 14th of November and uh after that it was successful and then after uh I had some complications and uh infections and uh it it was difficult at a point that I could not even I could not even walk I have to use the Walker to be walking in pain I could not even lift my leg like this from one step to come here and to take here they almost have to carry me to put me in the car but by the grace of almighty God Amen I I'm standing here today because God is good I remember telling us until God has finished with you nothing Canen can take you out of here that's the so I strongly believe in that so I just want to encourage us to continue to believe the word of the Lord amen amen and this evening just speaking to us I just want us to encourage our Say by keep your eyes on the promise very good amen after the surgery they asked me I have to go back to do a review and uh the doctor want to see if the stitches is healed inside what it cut whatever they did there and then I went and they did it and then I have to go back to the doctor and they said oh it's not completely healed come back in they give me another 10 days so in two weeks I went back and so I went on the table to be they do cogram just like a scan or whatever to see so when I I was put at lie on the table all of a sudden I be I was shaking shivering the whole table was shering and the doctors what is happening I don't know I I don't know what happened the next I realized I was in the emergency they had to call my wife come who broughty and then she came out and she was standing there they tried to give me some dreams and but it at that time said all my system was shutting down K everything was going down but the grace of God came again Hallelujah that until God has finished with a man nothing can take him out of here right I don't know what your condition is what your challenges are but what I've said to you that trust in the Lord God praise the name of the Lord and I said to the Lord I said whatever I go I will testify amen I said I will testify to The Shame of the devil and I will testify the glory of the [Applause] king because if God does something for us he wanted to testify it is very important for God that whatever it does for us no matter how you think it's small no matter what it is it might be small to you but it's not small to God so remember whatever God does for you and to you let us give glory to the king amen even for us to be alive we should be thankful to God for for you to be able to eat you should be thankful to God because there are people who cannot eat they cannot even swallow their own Sala they can't do it they cannot move and if God has been good to us we should be full and SE with joy and praises to the king of glory Let's A Hallelujah with my sister and the son that we were living with so just myself and my wife was home and a brother that was close to us that we could fall upon who he has been helping us with was 45 minutes drive away and so if this issue that I had at that time happened at home it would have been difficult for us because my wife would not have known even what to do and we were just strangers in the area but we have gone to the hospital and so right before the doctors this didn't happened and I said to Satan you miss it again his land fil because God is there amen so my brothers and sisters nothing happens accidentally the enemy will fight but God is on our side so we'll come out we win the battle Hallelujah and so I have to stay when they did the surgery they said robotic surgery so when they did it the next day I was discharged from the hospital but when I had this sh change I have to stay six days in the emergency praise the Lord the Lord is good am and it was blood infection call EOL or whatever they said it was BR in so why that they were trying to find out what antibiotics what to use what to use but through all God pulled me out he brought me through God is faithful am let's continue to trust him let's continue to look up to him it came to a place as I said I could not even walk when I have to sit in car they have to manage and I sit backward and then they have to leave in pains to place it in put it in the car it was very difficult but what was always I was confessing keep on saying this also shall pass this also shall pass because God is faithful and then after all 9 month they have to take the the C and when they did it even before then even if I lie down I could not turn this way I could not end this way I have to just be lying down like this if I see them I could not get up they have to pull me out all just difficult situation but the Lord saw me through all and so whatever you might be going through he will see you through sometime when we have challenges and trials then we wonder and we question why me why should I suffer I believe believe in God I trust in God I am faithful yeah you are faithful and that is why the tri come to show that you are faithful amen and the prophet of God said The more lawyer you are the more the test and it's not easy to go through trials and challenges but it is all for our testimony am when you are going through difficulties it's not easy but when it is over and you are testifying oh somebody wish miss it but there's a price to pay so dear ones God lost all of us and he cares for all of us and he has a reason and he has a purpose for every one of us so it's not good to look at somebody and try to compare yourself to somebody say why me why don't you why not you why don't you praise the name of the Lord so when you come to why me why this and that Satan build you be a complex that's right and then you come to pity yourself and then it comes that oh I God love somebody more than me and self pity is sin and then we should also remember that we are made differently for different purposes we are safe we are all safe different way God brought the light to us and we are all uniqu and so our trials and challenges are unique what will be a trial to you will not be a trial to somebody and what will be a trial to somebody will not be a trial to you son through the blood I mean son through the fire some through great sorrow some through difficulties but all through the blood so our trials differently differently differently but we all go through the blood so don't compare yourself to anybody whatever God ordained and chooses that I should go through and you should go through we ask for Grace to be faithful and I used to share with the people like if you read in the scriptures they had different Brothers there just a little example Peter one day was in prison sleeping among Two Soldiers and the angel of the Lord came down midnight because the Breen were praying before then we read in the scripture that Herod has already killed some of the Believers and he saw that the to which people were happy so he went ahead and took p and his intention was to kill him but the Believers were praying and midnight the angel of the Lord descended and I said to the Brethren the angel did not descend at midnight because he was afraid of the day and when he came he was not working like this in the prison no he was in charge he was in absolute control thr the soldiers were sleeping and he wake Peter up the chains fell off because of the presence of the Angel and may your chains fall off from you because of the presence of the anointed word of God because of the Angel of the Lord hallelujah the doors open on their own and he made a way for them to go out and whatever doors might be closed against you may God open it for you to be free he's mindful of us and he cares for us there was Apostle Paul and Silas that were also arrested for the same Gospel of Jesus Christ amen and the Bible told us that they were thrown also into jail after they have been beaten beaten and they were bleeding and they true them to J but the Bible told us Paul and Salas begin to sing they begin to worship God they sank until the other prisoners heard them singing so in your challenges in your trials you have to choose what to do you can sit that and mour and cry and be against and become FY and fight everybody around you or you can choose to love the Lord like somebody said to brother Bram you are Antichrist you are this and brother Bram said if that be the will of my father for me he said that's fine he said I want to do his will if he wants me to go to hell after everything he said even in hell I will love him hallah if he choose for me to be sick or have a challenge he allows it to come I will still love it I will still praise Him Paul and Silas were beaten and they choose to be praising God in prison as they continue to praise the Lord the praising doors open there is power in praises the pra door open they could have run out but they didn't they could have said Peter run out the angel brought Peter out this is no you have to know the purpose for your life you have to know why I am here because there is a purpose for everything so Paul and Silas could have gone because the doors were open but they stay they are going to prison was for a purpose whatever God allows is for a purpose and we must always pray for the purpose of God let me recognize let me know whatever is happening around us there is a purpose for it God has not forsaken you God has not forsaken you and it's not because God doesn't hear prayer he hears prayer he answers prayer and I want you to remember again that Faith also endures yes not always jump at Faith endures yes that's why the Bible tells us in the book of Hebrews 11 that others refuse Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection he said if they had been mindful they would have gone back but these people claim that they were strangers and pregrant and they said we pled allegiance to the Lamb of God we will not go they offered them Liberty Freedom If Only They would deny the cause of Christ they said no we will not do that may the Lord help us hallelujah Paul and Salas stay in the prison until the morning came and when the officer saw in the morning that the doors were open he look around and look around and he want to kill himself he want to take us to kill his because I believe that officer might have seen a lot of jail breaks people running out of jail and if you are an officer in charge and the fellow goes out then you have to take his place you have to answer you have to be try and he wanted to cut off his life then Paul and Sil said no don't do it don't kill yourself we are still here maybe you might find yourself in a situation that you don't know what to do and the devil will bring all kinds of thoughts in your mind leave the church kill yourself do this and do this no don't do it God is still in there God is still mindful God is still careful for you God Is Watching Over You God has a purpose so don't destroy yourself and be miserable and sit down and cry and want no end your life no you didn't give yourself life somebody give you life praise the name of the Lord we are here you there yes the next thing we he the man said what shall I do to be saved the reason they went to prison was for that man and his family God when he has brought us out the prophet said he can commit it to suffering to any challenge once you are okay he has finished with you he has a work and you know this my son this my child this my daughter is fine he can choose any maybe through your suffering through your difficulties somebody will come to know the Lord through your challenges through your trials somebody will come to know the Lord may the Lord help us hallelujah trust in the Lord and keep your eyes on the promise knowing that the steps of the righteous are of the Lord knowing that nothing can happen to any of us accidentally knowing that God cares for us he has a promise and he has a purpose for your life so keep your eyes on the promise not on yourself not on your trials not on your afflictions let your ey be on the promise of God because God and His word is the same so your eye must be on the Lord and in the book of Isaiah he said look unto me all ye ends of the Earth in this hour we are living in in this troublous world when there is so much fear and panic on the land nobody can tell what the next day is going to be nobody can explain it what is happening what leaders are confused nations are trouble there is distress among the nation there is a lot of difficulties but in this hour God caus to his children look unto me I am the way I am the truth I am the answer I am the Creator I am the controller of the universe when all around us is failing look unto me I will not fail you I will not forsake you look unto me all ye ends of the Earth to you as a church to you as a Believer to you as a young man he said look unto me in this hour of great need very good praise the name of the Lord am Hallelujah I wor C for n months and I said to the pastor one I said what I don't know but it's okay I said maybe God knows what will be happening to me so I we this C so that I will not fall anywhere hey whatever situation you find yourself in you must know how to behave so that you will not become miserable so that you will not be pting yourself so that you will not be saying why should it be me why why shouldn't you be me why God is Sovereign he does what pleases him and nothing can come to me or unless he allows it and nothing can happen to you because he is the door to the Sheepfold amen he is the door and he said nothing as the door nothing can go through unless he allows it to come in so nothing can harm us nothing can hurt us nothing can touch us until our God our Father the all knowing god the all righteous God the god of Israel unless he allows it we are his own he purchase us he save us oh Hallelujah I'm so glad I belong to Jesus he Our Redeemer he's our savior he's our god oh he's coming for us and I always said to the people the Bible say his mindful of us and that is his mind is full of us his mind is full of you you are the one that it thinks for you are the one is there for you everything that God has is for us oh Hallelujah so keep your eyes on him keep your eyes on the promise keep your eyes on the word because the word will never fail Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never fil Hallelujah for your sake it doesn't sleep and it doesn't Slumber the god of Israel does not sleep and does not Slumber he that Watches Over Us does no sleep and does not Slumber so keep your eyes on prise the Lord hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord saints of God God is good when they took off the remov the C from me I have to wear pest I became a big baby boy but today by God's grace I don't wear p oh saints of God don't be miserable don't let the devil beat you down don't let the devil tell you that God don't L you don't let the devil tell you that God don't care for you God cares for you God is mindful of you God cares for every one of us don't look at yourself don't look at your neighbor look to the Lord when you look at yourself you fail there is something about what you look at Prophet said the eye is an outlet to the soul so there is something about what you look at that affect your life if it is not so why do they advertise everything on Big Boss yeah why did I do it because it affect people you've not planned to buy something you just look at ah oh this is there like this I don't know sometime you go out you have not even prepared to buy some but you just look at it you want to buy it because there is something about what you look at what caused the fall is because if look and saw the three was good yes am what she saw is what brought us into this condition so God said look unto me keep your eyes on God keep your eyes on the word look at the word whatever happens around look to the word before you react before you do anything look to the word what does the word say what does God says amen praise the name of the Lord are we together there is something about what you look at yes in the Book of Genesis Chapter 30 Jacob did something there in the Bible when leban he and the father-in-law they were having some challenges Jacob said I've work for you you don't want to pay me okay it's okay I'm going to pay you now when we the animals give bir all that as Speckles and colors you will be that will be yours okay I hear so he made a trick there something that I don't know how he did it the Bible he took some pranks pop trees and then strick here and there and there and he fixed it in a way that when the animals come to give birth to conceive they they look at those things they look at those tricks and and they conceive the very color Genesis 30 you can go good and see is there so there is something about what you look at the if I come to your office let me see the music and let me see the books today many on the there are so many voices and they are all calling for attention he said there will never a voice that work attended to as the voice of the spirit e that up and hear Let Him hear what the spirit is us to look to him with all the distraction that is going on with all the challenges that is going on with all the scientific achievement that is going on with all the medical stuff that is going on with all the doctors and everything that we have God said look unto me I am the Lord that heal all your diseases I am the Lord your provider I am the Lord your creator I am the way the truth and the life I am the one that holds the universe you are my son you are my daughter amen am take my word because God is one with his word the Bible say God is not a man that he will lie or to say anything that he will not do the prophet of God said God will keep every promise of his he will keep every promise of his because he swore by himself and he told Abraham in blessing I will bless you in multiplying I will m multiply you God is true to his promise no matter what if he has to bankrupt the heavens he say he will have to bankrupt the heavens before he will let his word go defeated he will have to bankrupt the heaven before he will let his word go defeated so keep your eyes on the promise of God no matter the condition no matter what the doctor say no matter what your feelings say we are not asked to depend upon our feelings we are asked to depend upon the word hallelujah he's the high PRI that can be touched with our confession what we are confessing the prophet of God said God will make our body obey our confession and Jesus take our confession before God that this is the confessing amen we are confessing what God says if you believe you will confess it if you believe you'll look at it if you believe you hold on to it no matter regardless of the opposition amen right amen hallelujah amen now what made calb so sure of it when the opposition was so great it is according to what you are looking at can Caleb was looking at the promise of God the other 10 were looking at the circumstances if you go to look at the circumstance or you look at what is around you you are sure to fail amen if you look at the circumstances and the things that around you you are sure to fail so don't look at the circumstances right this is the children of Israel we know the story how they've come all the way from cadesh I mean from Egypt and all through out and they were now about to enter the promised land Hallelujah they've come all this way and they forgot oh God have mercy brother Bram said with all thank God for what he did yesterday we are looking forward to what he will be doing tomorrow and then but but we forgot what he's doing today we forget it this children of Israel what Miracle do they want to see when their own dress they were wearing set and and whatever they were wearing for 40 years they didn't grow old what a miracle you want to see for 40 years the CL didn't grow tread bear the shoes they were wearing whatever they were wearing and yet they begin to complain they were not satisfied oh Lord have mercy upon us they own cloth was a miracle and the Bible said there was no s person among there for 40 years and they were compl complaining and God hates complaining God hates memories Hallelujah if you sit here in America and you are complaining go out out you sit here you are complaining you have so many choices and you are complaining others have no choice nothing don't be ungrateful to God don't be ungrateful to God may God help us the Lord promised to take care of us the Lord promised to fight our battles for us and he fought their battles for them amen for them to come out of Egypt was a miracle after being there for 400 years and I'm telling you whatever condition you be in whatever situation you have been in the Lord is able to bring you out of it because God promised Abraham that this is what I will do you don't have to be here but I do it and after 400 years God came down and God said I have remembered my promise that I give to you that's right they were not there it was between God and Abraham but because i' remember and I've come down and I'll bring you out that was his promise and he stood behind it the battle was his battle and he fought it amen and this battle still belongs to God and will fight it we did not save ourselves in save us and he will take care of us so keep your eyes on that promise his promises are yeah and amen his word is forever settled in the heavens no matter what the enemy will do the enemy will be defeated am and brother said the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere any time under any condition so keep your eyes on that promise amen believe it it's more than able he say when he say something he means it when he was at the grave of Lazarus and he told oh be here my brother will not have your brother will live again your brother will rise again M said yes in the resurrection I know he said am the resurrection I am the resurrection in the life he believe yes and believe in me never never believest thou this do you also believe it do you also believe his word do you also believe his statement do you also believe what he says he said believe th this he as the question Jesus the question believe it all this the promises that are given to you the promises that we read do you also believe it do we believe what he says hallelujah oh praise the name of the Lord if you believe it keep your eyes on it keep looking keep holding on because Faithful Is He that has promised and he will do it it does not matter how long it does not matter when but he will do it he will do it Hallelujah because Faithful is our God glory to God in the highest keep your eyes on the promise turn your eyes from your sickness oh the doctor said if that's good oh brother Bram said the doctor must have done his best for you but God is yet to do his best God is yet to do his best for you the do done all that he know how to do what he has read of and this here there but this is not steud he's the creator of the body he's the creator of the universe oh Hallelujah so he's here to do his best for you I believe it Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord can't you say Amen to God's word you are just looking at me you said this brother is funny that's all right it's okay you can call me crazy that's fine that's your choice that's what you choose to do Hallelujah but I want you to know that the way that people call heresy that is the way we worship the god of our father and I always tell people look the only way you can serve God is to lose your mind lose your mind and get the mind of Christ because you can never please God with your own mind we need his mind so let this mind which was in Christ be in you that's what the church need that we can forsake our own way and forsake our thought and forsake our feelings and forsake the way we look at things and take what it says that's right that's why K can say yes they went to the land and yes they saw the anist there and yes they saw the and the Amit and the jebusites and all that the people saw Cal also saw it the city was say Cal saw it Joshua they saw it but they have a promise God said I have given you the land God said I have given you the land So Cal Joshua and calb were looking at the promise praise the Lord what are you also looking at what are we looking at today young people what are you looking at yeah the young people are doing this so what we are different people we are peculiar people we are a choosen generation let's get more of god let's get the spirit of God in us let's get the revelation of the word of God oh because there is nothing of prevailing power just such as the revelation of the word of God God the revelation of Jesus Christ in your life oh Hallelujah may God reveal to us to know that this word Jesus said Heaven and the Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away your brother shall rise again your brother shall live again he saying the Resurrection The Resurrection I'm standing right here what did you better him take a stone from there oh Lord didn't I tell you to believe didn't I tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God hallelujah he brought him out because his word is y and amen amen K look at the promise yes he was a small fellow Joshua but the promise of God anoint they energize them amen that's right yes and they were just looking they were not looking at the giant okay they giant but they didn't look at that God Almighty has given a promise and they look at that promise he said we are well able to overcome we are able to take it because God said so because God gave the promise because God said by myself I have swor amen so God said so yes that's right keep your eyes on that promise what say about Joshua when they came to jerich the city was closed was F the wall big wall think about 80t thick wall 80 that r on it and house on it and it was closed how would thatall fall down how are you crazy of course you have to be crazy to believe that and Joshua believe he his reason and he had to the prise because God said as I was with Moses I will be with you I will not fail you and nothing can stand before you no man stand before you all the days of your life he believed that promise he had on to that promise when the art was against him when Theos was so great his eyes was on the promise and the words of Jero fell any around you can also fall any world around you can also fall if you keep your eyes on the promise of the almighty God hallelujah oh praise the Lord Jesus what are you looking at today let me just read a little the prophecy said here and then it was Joshua he Ste the people and said we are more than able to possess it we have more than able because why he was looking at the promise he was a true Seed of Abraham regardless of what the opposition was we can possess the gate because God promised the land amen the Christian doesn't look at the circumstances he looks at the word and stands still God says so that settles it what if Abraham had looked at the circumstances What If Abraham our father had looked at the circumstances Sarah was old he was old the Bible say they were we stricken in age but God gave the promise God told him out of Isaac your SE shall be called after 100 years and over God said to Abraham go and sacrifice your son Isaac your son that you love sacrifice him for me he didn't in question you might not understand or might have understood no God said it it's okay we want to we want everything to be explained to us everything must be explained before we act it nothing was explained to Abraham all the explanation is take your son and go and sacrifice him for me where I will show you to go go there and sacrifice and Abraham believed God hallelujah Abraham believed God it took his son and he wait as God said listen sints of God we have a whole B with us that we all read apart from the Bible we have we' had the the the Amplified Bible the message of the hour the book is open we have the open book with us we have read from Genesis to Revelation and the Mysteries all have been made known to us so ABR didn't have nothing to refer to he had nothing that he could read there was nothing could refer to we have things to refer to from Genesis we have men many people to refer to so what are we looking at today hallelujah hallelujah look at the promise we have brothers and sisters here people that have gone through trials and challenges and we seen the hand of God upon them when the devil is pointing you and look at you alone look at this and brother say he always pointed to the one who is not making it tell the devil look at my brother he had this trouble God brought him out that same God will bring me out also Hallelujah I said to the people if the devil is talking tell that Timothy today Timothy who could not work before today is running I could not walk but today I can run I was wearing Pampers today I don't wear Pampers yes my brothers God did it and I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to testify to tell you that I was down here and it took me [Applause] out I cannot polish anything to you I have to tell you the way it was because sometimes even we become ashamed to speak on things that God has done asame of God be merciful what are we talking keep your eyes the reason Israel F before golad because they were looking at golad instead of the promise when David came he was not looking at golat golad was there all right but he said this man I will kill him he said because God Del me from the power of the lion and the bear he said that say God will do it again keep your eyes on the promise not on your problems not on your difficulties not on your failures of the promise then we can s every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line I am trusting in his love divine all the Redemptive blessings are for us what are we sitting down like this for why are we saying to ourselves it's not for me it's not for you now are we the sons of God now we are now we are going to we are now and the prophet of God said a son in the house and a servant who has a right who has Authority the Son and the prophet said we have more Authority than the Archangel he said the very if you have the Holy Ghost in you he said the very God of creation is in you Hallelujah is that the devil want to hide this thing from us he don't want us to come to the realization and the recognition so that we can act upon it what God says we are is what we are keep your eyes for the promise don't be looking around if you look around you will sink if you look around you will fail true look at your problem I have this challenge I have this challenge I have that's good it's true you have it but he's the answer he's the way is the truth and the life let me close by saying this Peter one day walking on the sea because Jesus told him to come he said if it is you Lord let me come and the Lord said come and he started walking on the water because Jesus said come he was going he was going until he turned to look the other side when he to look the other side he saw the words coming who asked you to look who ask you to look he begin to scream when he was walking on the water looking to Jesus the water was still there the words were still tossing up and down but when his eyes was on the Lord he didn't have Problem whatever might be happening around us keep your eyes on him and you go through and you walk through P was sinking because he wanted to hear this he wanted to see that and then he was going down he cried Lord help me and if you cry he will help you too so that you keep your eyes stay focused Lord you will go through because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday amen today and forever look at Israel today in their crisis you know they are confessing the word of God every day they calling God every day and they know God will do it for them and they come out to say that we will win Israel will win the war we win this battle and they will because ever since God has been fighting if it is not God that is on their behalf this small nation all the whole world the whole world is standing against them and not moved they are not moved they said we will finish this world they started it but we finish it for them and it's it's enough for them to fear because big Nations and their enemies are so many their enemies are so many but they still confess we win this battle why because they believe in the god of Abraham they calling upon the god of Abraham they confessing the god of Abraham they said our Liv our our our our connection with this land is from the days of our fathers over 4,000 he said that is our document the Bible is our document if Israel today can say the Bible is our docent what about
