[46:42] days I'm ready for
[46:44] Sunshine but I do not I do not want the
[46:47] summer to come on too quickly so thank
[46:50] the Lord for the rain cools it off a
[46:52] little bit hold back that
[46:54] summer
[46:56] until
[46:57] September
[47:00] and and we'll be good amen my brother
[47:05] came to me yesterday he the prostate
[47:08] cancer has uh shown up again uh the
[47:12] doctors have said uh for him to do chemo
[47:16] and hormone
[47:18] treatment he said uh which he has done
[47:22] before and he said um if I don't do
[47:26] anything uh how long and the doctor said
[47:29] well you have about 8
[47:32] months and so he came to me yesterday he
[47:36] said I am doing no chemo I am doing no
[47:39] hormone my life is in God's
[47:43] hands and I agree with him I say
[47:46] hey uh we know our days are numbered huh
[47:51] and everything and uh I believe the
[47:55] coming of the Lord is so
[47:56] soon he may not die of any of that we
[47:59] all may go home and be with the Lord
[48:01] before that I believe the coming of the
[48:04] Lord is so very very close now let me
[48:07] say this I know you're all standing
[48:10] but just because you've been raised up
[48:14] around or associated with this
[48:17] message does not mean that you catch the
[48:22] Revelation contained within the message
[48:26] some of the children raised up in the
[48:29] message have got to understand they are
[48:32] taught principles
[48:35] doctrines um maybe in their eyes without
[48:39] having a revelation from Christ himself
[48:42] it may look a little
[48:45] legalistic but Jesus says if you love me
[48:49] you keep my
[48:52] Commandments it's not the keeping of the
[48:54] law but it's because of love and our
[48:57] love towards
[48:59] Christ um and so uh today I am going to
[49:05] be answering some questions that were
[49:07] given to me they were put on my desk
[49:10] here um a few weeks
[49:13] ago and uh I would like all of you to
[49:18] just remain standing and turn with me in
[49:20] your Bibles to St John chap
[49:24] 12
[49:27] and we'll read verses
[49:30] 12 excuse me 32 through 34 so turn to St
[49:36] John
[49:38] 12
[49:40] 32 through
[49:54] 34 and if I be lifted up from the
[49:59] earth I will draw all men unto
[50:03] me this he said signifying what death he
[50:06] should
[50:08] die the people answered
[50:10] him we have heard out of the law that
[50:13] Christ abideth
[50:16] forever how sayest thou the son of man
[50:20] must be lifted
[50:22] up who is this son of man may God add
[50:28] that blessing to the reading of his word
[50:30] you all may be seated this morning in
[50:32] the presence of
[50:35] God very good question who is this son
[50:39] of
[50:41] man we realize that we've had a
[50:44] revealing of the son of man in this last
[50:46] day but just
[50:47] because he has come he has spoke we have
[50:52] God's word on tape recording as far as
[50:55] as the revealing in this hour we've got
[50:58] it in book form that doesn't mean you'll
[51:00] get it unless the Holy Spirit reveals it
[51:04] to
[51:07] you none of you are exempt from that
[51:12] amen so Matthew chapter
[51:18] 16 then we'll go to Luke chap 9 Matthew
[51:22] 16 vers 13 through
[51:28] 17 when Jesus came into the coast of
[51:32] cesaria
[51:34] Philippi he asked his
[51:36] disciples who do men say that I the son
[51:40] of man
[51:42] am he's asking a
[51:46] question who do
[51:48] men yeah say that
[51:51] I the son of man
[51:54] am
[51:56] and they said some say that thou art
[51:58] John the
[52:01] Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah
[52:05] are one of the
[52:07] prophets so now these are all
[52:09] speculation according to carnal
[52:12] understanding
[52:15] corre and he saith unto
[52:19] Peter but whom say
[52:23] ye that I am amen right yes and Simon
[52:28] Peter answered and said Thou Art the
[52:32] Christ the son of the Living
[52:36] God and Jesus answered and said unto him
[52:40] blessed art thou Simon bar
[52:43] Jonah for Flesh and
[52:46] Blood hath not revealed it to
[52:49] you but none but my
[52:53] Father which is in heaven
[52:55] where does revelation come
[52:57] from your father in
[53:01] heaven doesn't come from your pastor
[53:04] doesn't come from your parents let me
[53:07] say this it doesn't come from the
[53:08] Prophet come on brother it comes to you
[53:12] by way of God
[53:13] himself Revelation is god making his
[53:17] word known to you and Upon This Rock I
[53:20] will build my
[53:21] [Applause]
[53:23] church that's right
[53:26] Luke
[53:30] 9 verses 18-
[53:34] 21 just another Viewpoint of Christ
[53:38] asking the same
[53:40] question but it's answered just a little
[53:42] bit differently and from there I wish to
[53:45] launch out this
[53:47] morning thank you Lord Luke
[53:51] 9:18 and it came to pass as he was alone
[53:56] praying his disciples were with him and
[53:59] he asked them saying who say the people
[54:04] that I
[54:07] am and they answering said John the
[54:09] Baptist some say Elias and others say
[54:13] that one of the prophets is risen again
[54:15] and he said unto them but whom say ye
[54:18] that I
[54:19] am and Peter answering
[54:24] said the Christ of god
[54:28] wow heavenly father now as we have read
[54:32] Thy word yes surely we could ask this
[54:35] same question again today and here among
[54:39] our people
[54:41] and due
[54:44] to Revelation or without Revelation or
[54:48] by understanding or without
[54:50] understanding I'm sure that we would get
[54:53] a multitude of different answers
[54:56] but father we ask heavenly father that
[54:59] you will open unto us our understanding
[55:03] of who is the son of man I ask it For
[55:08] Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name
[55:13] amen I would like to title my Min the
[55:16] sermon this
[55:18] morning the
[55:20] ministry of the son of man
[55:23] amen he had a Ministry he had a
[55:27] mission he says I did not come to reveal
[55:30] myself I came to reveal my father I come
[55:34] to do his
[55:35] will he says I have a purpose of what I
[55:39] am
[55:40] doing so we're looking at the sermon
[55:43] titled the ministry of the son of
[55:46] man and the subject is who is the son of
[55:50] man and we're going to do questions and
[55:53] answers this morning I was
[55:56] given a couple weeks
[55:59] ago this yellow piece of paper on my
[56:03] desk we have eight
[56:06] questions my wife came to me this
[56:09] morning she said honey we've got to go
[56:11] and I was just wildly typing away at 32
[56:15] words per
[56:17] minute and uh she said and I said oh my
[56:21] time has just gotten away from me have
[56:24] any of you ever got got into something
[56:25] and it's so intriguing and the word is
[56:27] opening and opening and opening and and
[56:29] all of a sudden time just seems to go by
[56:32] and where did it go and normally I like
[56:35] to be here an hour before church and and
[56:38] uh um we were
[56:41] late and uh uh everything but I very
[56:46] quickly then
[56:48] finished what I was just having some
[56:52] thoughts on and then I had to cut and
[56:54] paste all of my notes and send it to the
[56:57] Brethren and everything so I pray that
[56:59] this will be a blessing to you and
[57:02] perhaps answer some questions that you
[57:06] have concerning what is the revealing of
[57:09] the son of man and who is this son of
[57:12] man uh so I wish to expound on this now
[57:16] for the next 45 minutes to an
[57:20] hour now the word or the phrase the son
[57:23] of man is is used within your
[57:27] Bible
[57:29] 196
[57:34] times it has been
[57:37] used in the Old Testament to describe a
[57:40] prophet a Seer a man sent from God yes
[57:47] sir and you will find that the most of
[57:51] the time when it says son of man in the
[57:54] old test Testament the sentence just
[57:57] preceding that son of man phrase it says
[58:03] the word of the Lord came unto the
[58:06] prophet son of man
[58:11] prophesy I want you to
[58:14] understand that actually when you take
[58:17] it back to the original Hebrew and you
[58:19] see in the word of the Lord came to the
[58:22] prophet it actually means the word of
[58:24] the Lord became the
[58:27] prophet Amen in other words he was so
[58:30] Anointed with the spirit of
[58:33] God this anointing that was upon him he
[58:37] now did speak and became the mouthpiece
[58:40] of
[58:43] God and many times he didn't understand
[58:46] what he was saying he didn't understand
[58:49] that many times after they got done they
[58:51] were perplexed in
[58:53] themselves what time and what is this
[58:56] prophecy when is this going to come to
[59:01] pass and so in the Book of Ezekiel alone
[59:06] Ezekiel in the Old Testament over 90
[59:10] times does he speak to
[59:13] Ezekiel oh son of
[59:15] man more than any other book in the Old
[59:20] Testament let me show you a few examples
[59:23] here in Ezekiel chapter 3:
[59:27] 16 it came to pass at the end of seven
[59:31] days that the word of the Lord came unto
[59:34] me now here is an anointing coming on a
[59:38] prophet of God and this anointing is
[59:41] bringing to him
[59:44] thought the thought is not his thought
[59:47] but God is quickening to
[59:51] him a
[59:53] thought something that God wants Ezekiel
[59:58] to
[59:59] speak and he says saying son of
[1:00:03] man I have made thee a Watchman under
[1:00:07] the house of Israel so we realize that
[1:00:09] he as a Watchman God is going to have
[1:00:13] him set on the wall and to watch over
[1:00:16] Israel brother brenon preaches the
[1:00:18] sermon Watchman what of the
[1:00:22] night Verse 18 when I say unto the
[1:00:25] wicked now he's
[1:00:28] speaking through this anointing to
[1:00:30] Ezekiel when I
[1:00:32] speak or when I say unto the
[1:00:36] wicked Thou shalt surely die and thou
[1:00:40] giveth him not warning he's talking now
[1:00:43] to Ezekiel if you don't warn him if I
[1:00:45] say to the wicked you're going to die
[1:00:48] and you don't warn
[1:00:51] him nor speak us to warn the wicked from
[1:00:54] his his Wicked way to save his life the
[1:00:58] same the wicked man shall die in his
[1:01:00] iniquity but his blood will I require at
[1:01:04] thine
[1:01:06] hand what a great responsibility a
[1:01:10] Watchman has what a Shepherd has what a
[1:01:14] preacher has because I can tell you by
[1:01:18] the word of God none of you will
[1:01:21] actually be held accountable for me but
[1:01:24] I will be held accountable to all of you
[1:01:27] of what I tell
[1:01:32] you
[1:01:34] that makes
[1:01:37] me fear and tremble
[1:01:41] realizing that I do not want any one of
[1:01:45] you on the day of
[1:01:48] judgment to be able to put your finger
[1:01:51] in my face and said you never told me
[1:01:54] about about
[1:01:55] that you never warned
[1:01:58] me why didn't you tell me I would have
[1:02:03] repented so what a responsibility we
[1:02:07] have I'm not here to try to become
[1:02:10] everybody's golfing partner and
[1:02:12] friend Paul said I'd rather be a friend
[1:02:15] to Christ and an enemy to
[1:02:17] man so what I'm saying I say to you in
[1:02:21] the fear of God
[1:02:23] right
[1:02:25] amen verse 19 yet have thou warned the
[1:02:28] wicked and he turned not from his
[1:02:30] wickedness nor from his Wicked way he
[1:02:32] shall die in his iniquity but thou Hast
[1:02:34] delivered thy
[1:02:37] Soul so I'm delivering my soul this
[1:02:41] morning because I'm going to tell you
[1:02:43] what he said Ezekiel 13 and veres 1-3
[1:02:48] and the word of the Lord came unto me
[1:02:52] saying son of man prophesy against the
[1:02:55] prophets of Israel that prophesy and say
[1:02:59] thou unto them that prophesy out of
[1:03:01] their own
[1:03:03] Hearts hear ye the word of the
[1:03:06] Lord thus sayith the Lord God woe unto
[1:03:09] those foolish prophets that follow their
[1:03:13] own spirit and have seen nothing now I
[1:03:17] just giving you uh a couple examples out
[1:03:21] of 90 examples just in the book of eek
[1:03:25] eel
[1:03:27] so I want you to
[1:03:30] understand
[1:03:33] um and show you some things from the
[1:03:36] message of the hour because the message
[1:03:39] of the hour when God sends a prophet in
[1:03:41] this hour what he does he gives the
[1:03:45] prophet an understanding from
[1:03:49] scripture and then when he preaches on
[1:03:52] that scripture he identif ifies that
[1:03:55] scripture and makes it known amen now
[1:03:58] we've had our Bible we've had the word
[1:04:00] of
[1:04:03] God but men with their own understanding
[1:04:07] have put their own interpretation to it
[1:04:10] divided it taken what they want what
[1:04:13] they don't
[1:04:15] want and that's the reason we have so
[1:04:17] many divisions Among Us so many
[1:04:21] denominations but God knowing that he
[1:04:24] will judge the world according to the
[1:04:28] word because the word of God is his
[1:04:31] absolute can we say Amen to
[1:04:35] that his word will never pass
[1:04:38] away that's
[1:04:40] right
[1:04:42] so uh the
[1:04:46] anointing that was upon Ezekiel I want
[1:04:49] you to understand this and listen
[1:04:51] carefully what I'm
[1:04:52] saying the anointing that was upon
[1:04:56] Ezekiel and the word of the Lord that
[1:04:59] came to him
[1:05:01] saying I want you to understand that was
[1:05:04] the Christ of
[1:05:07] God not Jesus that was the man the
[1:05:12] mediator the
[1:05:14] Kinsman but the
[1:05:16] Christ of God who do they say that I the
[1:05:19] son of man am well they said Jeremiah
[1:05:23] Ezekiel one of the prophets John the
[1:05:25] Baptist they all got all their but who
[1:05:29] do you say that I am do you really know
[1:05:31] who I
[1:05:32] am and then there was Peter who began to
[1:05:36] catch something and like a little
[1:05:39] student who knows the answer to the
[1:05:41] question in the classroom ask
[1:05:44] me ask me Peter who do you say that I am
[1:05:51] he said Thou Art the Christ of God amen
[1:05:55] amen do you understand they had the
[1:06:00] word but now for the first time they had
[1:06:04] an
[1:06:05] anointing and the anointing on that word
[1:06:08] made him the
[1:06:10] Messiah come and see is this not he the
[1:06:14] Messiah the Christ that has been
[1:06:17] prophesied is this not the anointed one
[1:06:21] that would come and explain to us and
[1:06:24] bring us back to the Faith of Our
[1:06:26] Fathers bring us back to what God's word
[1:06:29] says not what man says what God's word
[1:06:32] says that's what prophets do that's
[1:06:36] right they bring you back to what God's
[1:06:37] word
[1:06:39] says amen praise God amen amen a prophet
[1:06:44] is none other than the mouthpiece of
[1:06:47] Goden they are an
[1:06:50] oracle they speak what God anoints to
[1:06:55] them
[1:06:56] amen now let me show you in what is a
[1:06:59] vision because I now take the message of
[1:07:03] the hour spoken as from a prophet in
[1:07:06] this
[1:07:07] hour to
[1:07:10] clarify about a son of man so in the
[1:07:14] sermon what is a vision in 56 now I'm
[1:07:17] not comparing myself with a prophet no
[1:07:20] sir no no uh I'm just a poor sinner
[1:07:24] saved by grace but the gift that the
[1:07:27] lord gave the prophets and made them
[1:07:29] prophets they were God's
[1:07:31] mouthpiece Now understand they were they
[1:07:35] were not chosen by man they were chosen
[1:07:38] by
[1:07:39] God they had the word of the Lord and no
[1:07:42] Prophet ever did do anything just upon
[1:07:45] his own
[1:07:47] desire he did it first after God had
[1:07:51] told him that's right
[1:07:54] amen I only do as the father shows me
[1:07:57] that's right it only has to come through
[1:07:59] Divine
[1:08:01] powers to reveal through
[1:08:04] flesh and Christ was God's mouthpiece on
[1:08:08] Earth everybody understand that so we're
[1:08:11] talking about it's a divine
[1:08:14] power what is revelation to you divine
[1:08:19] understanding and that Divine
[1:08:21] understanding brings you power
[1:08:24] if this knowledge or understanding does
[1:08:27] not bring to
[1:08:28] [Applause]
[1:08:30] you power that changes your life it's
[1:08:34] just head knowledge it's just
[1:08:38] teaching it's just the
[1:08:41] Commandments it's just the
[1:08:43] law but when Revelation strikes that
[1:08:47] seed amen what it does it brings to them
[1:08:50] under ah wow yes ah is one of those aha
[1:08:56] moments and there are so many that I see
[1:08:58] even while I'm preaching people who have
[1:09:00] been around for a while who has heard
[1:09:03] the message of the hour perhaps it's a
[1:09:05] child who's been raised in this message
[1:09:07] and all it was was Creeds and dogmas and
[1:09:10] and teachings and all of a
[1:09:13] sudden wow I never understood
[1:09:17] that what is that that is not brother
[1:09:21] Ron that is not my teaching what it is
[1:09:25] is God is quickening his word and
[1:09:29] thoughts are coming direct to you and
[1:09:31] you have a revelation that comes from
[1:09:34] God and that is given to you through
[1:09:37] faith and faith is a
[1:09:40] gift not of
[1:09:42] works you didn't earn
[1:09:45] it right you are saved by grace through
[1:09:50] faith and that being a gift of God
[1:09:54] and not of Works lest any man should
[1:10:01] boast
[1:10:03] so God had to come through divine power
[1:10:08] Revelation and reveal it through F
[1:10:11] through
[1:10:13] flesh God uses man because God is God
[1:10:18] uses man as his
[1:10:21] instrument since the beginning of
[1:10:25] time when God needed something to be
[1:10:29] done God sent a
[1:10:32] man when he needed somebody to till the
[1:10:35] garden God sent Adam a
[1:10:39] man when God needed to correct a whole
[1:10:43] nation God sent a
[1:10:46] man when God needed to do away with
[1:10:51] sin he sent a man the man Christ
[1:10:56] Jesus so that's the instrument that God
[1:10:59] uses and yet so much of the time we
[1:11:02] misunderstand brother Bram said it's so
[1:11:05] hard for us to believe one another oh oh
[1:11:09] that's just brother
[1:11:11] Ron that that's just him he just said
[1:11:14] that that well if you would
[1:11:18] understand really what God is doing
[1:11:21] behind this Pulpit right now
[1:11:29] you might have the windows of Heaven
[1:11:31] open to you and you you realize oh my
[1:11:34] God this is a dreadful place this is
[1:11:38] none other than bethl the house of
[1:11:47] God so improving his word 64 and the son
[1:11:51] of man is revealing himself in this same
[1:11:54] power that he
[1:11:55] was not down through the church ages
[1:11:58] through justification sanctification all
[1:12:00] the things here but the son of man who
[1:12:03] is the son of man the word word is
[1:12:08] quicker powerful deerns the thoughts
[1:12:10] that's in the
[1:12:11] heart what did he have to do he has to
[1:12:14] prove that
[1:12:16] word
[1:12:17] notice of it when it was happening look
[1:12:21] at it in the same form
[1:12:24] he was here in the beginning the pillar
[1:12:27] of fire amen my proving that Hebrews 13
[1:12:32] and8 said Jesus Christ is the same
[1:12:35] yesterday today and forever what was it
[1:12:39] Jesus Christ the same yesterday that was
[1:12:42] Christ that was in the wilderness with
[1:12:45] [Applause]
[1:12:47] Moses who was
[1:12:48] it it was
[1:12:51] Christ how many knows the Bible said
[1:12:54] that yesterday that was Christ when Paul
[1:12:58] was teaching here today you believe that
[1:13:00] in the New Testament who was it in the
[1:13:03] days of Paul who was it in
[1:13:06] Paul it was
[1:13:09] Christ then the son of man the same
[1:13:12] Christ in the last day who is this son
[1:13:16] of
[1:13:20] man it's
[1:13:22] Christ
[1:13:27] the word of the Lord comes to the
[1:13:29] prophets
[1:13:31] amen the Christ of God is what caused
[1:13:34] all of the Old Testament prophets and
[1:13:36] Saints of old to act out their part that
[1:13:41] God wrote of them in the
[1:13:42] word I want you to understand this is
[1:13:45] none other than a great
[1:13:48] drama in the
[1:13:50] beginning scene one
[1:13:53] enter Adam enter
[1:13:56] Eve that's scene one any of you ever
[1:14:00] been in a play paid a part in a played a
[1:14:04] part in a
[1:14:06] play you have to know your
[1:14:09] lines you have to play your part you
[1:14:12] have to know what scene you're in you
[1:14:16] have to know what age you're
[1:14:20] in otherwise if you don't know who you
[1:14:23] are and what part you play you can
[1:14:25] identify yourself in the play in The
[1:14:29] Script where do you belong in this great
[1:14:32] drama yes
[1:14:35] sir God wrote this great drama and he
[1:14:38] put it out there in scene one all this
[1:14:40] right down into scene 22 in the Book of
[1:14:46] Revelation
[1:14:48] now so I want you to understand what
[1:14:52] caused all of them to play their
[1:14:56] part was the Christ of God anointing
[1:15:00] them to speak and to act amen and to do
[1:15:05] the things that they
[1:15:09] did amen you imagine here's Noah just
[1:15:13] going
[1:15:16] along he just old
[1:15:20] Noah doing his thing
[1:15:23] he might be out because he he works with
[1:15:27] wood and he's going to work with wood
[1:15:28] for 120 years so maybe he's
[1:15:36] doing
[1:15:46] Noah
[1:15:51] Noah who's calling
[1:15:54] me God coming down making himself
[1:16:00] known speaking to
[1:16:06] Noah as it was in the days of Noah I
[1:16:08] want to ask you how many people in the
[1:16:12] days of Noah got thus sayith the Lord
[1:16:15] build an
[1:16:18] ark huh one you mean to tell me that God
[1:16:23] judge the whole world by the revelation
[1:16:26] of one
[1:16:28] man
[1:16:30] repent get in the ark it's going to
[1:16:36] rain as it was in the days of Noah so
[1:16:39] shall it
[1:16:41] be is it so strange that God would send
[1:16:44] one a prophet in this age and judge the
[1:16:47] whole
[1:16:48] [Applause]
[1:16:50] world he's the same yes yesterday today
[1:16:53] and forever
[1:16:55] Hall it was Christ in
[1:16:58] David it didn't say Jesus was in David
[1:17:02] it said the Christ was in
[1:17:07] him and it was the Christ in him making
[1:17:10] him say and do and act all the things
[1:17:13] that he was
[1:17:14] doing Paul picks it up in Galatians I
[1:17:17] speak to you this all the time Galatians
[1:17:20] 2 and 20 I am crucified with
[1:17:24] Christ nevertheless I live yet not
[1:17:29] I but Christ liveth in me and the life I
[1:17:33] now live in the
[1:17:36] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:17:41] God it's no longer I that live but
[1:17:44] Christ that liveth in
[1:17:45] me it's not me doing the works it's him
[1:17:48] amen amen this is the great
[1:17:52] mystery
[1:17:55] my now remember Christ is the mystery of
[1:17:59] God
[1:18:00] revealed without Christ you do not know
[1:18:04] God for Jesus said no man knows the
[1:18:06] father except through the
[1:18:08] son and whom he will reveal it that's
[1:18:12] correct
[1:18:14] Christ Christ let's all say the word
[1:18:17] Christ is the
[1:18:20] mystery of God revealed amen amen he's
[1:18:24] the identified Christ of all
[1:18:27] ages yes so when you understand who is
[1:18:30] this son of
[1:18:32] man what does he do what are the works
[1:18:34] how did he do back then what will he do
[1:18:38] today amen who is this son of man on how
[1:18:44] can I know
[1:18:47] him Colossians 1: 25- 28 wherefore I am
[1:18:52] me to

[1:25:42] different speaking languages people they
[1:25:47] were there on that day and they all
[1:25:50] began to raise their hands

[1:25:58] utterance and the Bible says and they
[1:26:00] said are these not galileans right how

[1:26:58] different languages we hear them all in
[1:27:02] the language wherein we were born God
[1:27:05] did not change the
[1:27:08] tongue he chained the ear do you see
[1:27:12] what the Holy Spirit does he comes down
[1:27:16] and he makes his word known to you by
[1:27:19] changing your
[1:27:20] ear he that hath an ear yes

[1:27:27] Hallelujah that's the truth let him
[1:27:31] here what the
[1:27:35] spirit that's
[1:27:39] it praise
[1:27:45] God proving his word
[1:27:49] 65 when he was on Earth here the first
[1:27:52] first time he was a son of
[1:27:54] man he could not be Son of God then he
[1:27:57] never claimed to be did you know Jesus
[1:28:00] in all the New Testament never said I'm
[1:28:03] the Son of
[1:28:05] God he said I'm the son of
[1:28:08] man who is this son of
[1:28:11] man yes sir amen yes
[1:28:16] sir he said Son of Man wouldn't anybody
[1:28:19] would question him he said you see the
[1:28:21] son of man son of man now son of man is
[1:28:24] a
[1:28:26] prophet he had to come that way because
[1:28:28] the scripture he could not come contrary
[1:28:31] to the
[1:28:34] scripture paragraph 129 now we find out
[1:28:37] in this man he had to be a prophet not
[1:28:41] Son of God there he had to be son of man
[1:28:43] Jehovah himself called the prophets
[1:28:46] Jeremiah and them son of man yes when
[1:28:51] you see the son of man who is the son of
[1:28:53] man they kept asking
[1:29:00] right we're asking the same question
[1:29:03] today who is this son of
[1:29:07] man to our
[1:29:11] children who is the son of man was
[1:29:14] William brandham the son of man
[1:29:19] come who is it
[1:29:22] tell me that I that I'll know who to
[1:29:25] follow yeah because I'll tell you I want
[1:29:28] all of you to understand this I'm going
[1:29:30] to say
[1:29:32] this and I trust it does not offend you
[1:29:36] we are not following the words of a man
[1:29:39] that's
[1:29:42] correct we are
[1:29:44] following thus say the
[1:29:47] Lord a message that came through a son
[1:29:51] of man
[1:29:55] but because of the veil many people are
[1:29:57] stumbled by it yes sir come on amen
[1:30:01] that's brother RM said one of the
[1:30:03] hardest things that God can get us to do
[1:30:05] is to believe one human to
[1:30:08] another
[1:30:13] amen now watch this loudy see in church
[1:30:17] age the Baptists have their Creeds and
[1:30:19] dogmas based on the word and you can't
[1:30:22] shake them amen what is their Doctrine
[1:30:25] based on the word and you can't shake
[1:30:29] them they say the apostolic days of
[1:30:31] Miracles are over and there's no baptism
[1:30:34] with the Holy Ghost subsequent to
[1:30:36] believing the methodists say based on
[1:30:38] the word there is no water baptism
[1:30:42] sprinkling is not baptism and that
[1:30:45] sanctification is the baptism with the
[1:30:47] Holy Ghost Church of Christ majors and
[1:30:50] regeneration B baptism all to many cases
[1:30:54] they go down dry Sinners and come up wet
[1:30:56] ones right yet they claim their Doctrine
[1:30:59] is word based come on go right down the
[1:31:03] line to the Pentecostals do they have
[1:31:05] the word give them the word
[1:31:08] test you see they will sell out the word
[1:31:11] for a
[1:31:12] sensation just about every time if you
[1:31:15] can produce a manifestation like oil and
[1:31:18] blood and tongues and other signs
[1:31:21] whether the word or not or whether
[1:31:24] properly identified from the word the
[1:31:26] majority will fall for
[1:31:28] it
[1:31:30] tradition yeah so at the end of this age
[1:31:34] I am spewing you out of my mouth it's
[1:31:36] all over amen I'm going to speak all
[1:31:39] right yes I am here in the midst of the
[1:31:42] church the amen of God faithful and true

[1:32:06] from organization
[1:32:08] education and the world of religion that
[1:32:11] as John the Baptist and the Elijah of
[1:32:13] old he will hear only from God and he
[1:32:16] will have thus saith the Lord and speak
[1:32:19] for God praise God he will be God's
[1:32:23] mouthpiece And he as it is declared in
[1:32:26] Malachi

[1:32:30] back to the
[1:32:32] fathers he will bring back the elect in
[1:32:35] the last days and they will hear a
[1:32:37] Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth
[1:32:40] as it was with
[1:32:41] Paul he will restore the truth as they
[1:32:44] had it and those elect with him in that
[1:32:48] day Hallelujah will be the ones who
[1:32:51] truly manifest the Lord hallelujah and

[1:34:35] sure has to
[1:34:39] be give me a I will give you a Bible
[1:34:42] trivia right now the son of man is
[1:34:47] used only 75 times in the New Testament
[1:34:54] Matthew Mark Luke
[1:34:56] John 30 times Matthew 25 Luke 15 and 12
[1:35:03] I believe so many 75 times in the old in
[1:35:06] the New Testament except for one time in
[1:35:09] the book of Acts and two times in the
[1:35:11] Book of
[1:35:12] Revelation rest of the time it doesn't
[1:35:15] really talk about the son of
[1:35:17] man but who is his son of man Jesus is
[1:35:21] asking asking the question who do they
[1:35:22] say that I the son of man
[1:35:26] am right Peter had to answer Thou Art
[1:35:29] the Christ of
[1:35:31] God
[1:35:32] sh Peter do you know that two verses
[1:35:37] later he says and he commanded them to
[1:35:40] tell this to no
[1:35:43] [Music]
[1:35:45] man if they don't catch
[1:35:49] it shut your mouth
[1:35:52] can't you see it can't you see it come
[1:35:54] on
[1:35:56] man
[1:35:58] huh you can't make anybody see
[1:36:02] it neither can you keep it from the
[1:36:05] elect from
[1:36:07] seeing because when they see
[1:36:09] it
[1:36:11] huh their eyes come open they realize
[1:36:14] it's
[1:36:15] him remember the two on the road to emus
[1:36:18] there he was Christ the Resurrected Lord
[1:36:21] walking with two that knew him his
[1:36:25] disciples and the Bible says and eyes
[1:36:27] were were held back that they didn't
[1:36:30] know
[1:36:31] him they say he he joins himself to him
[1:36:34] invisible
[1:36:36] Union good why are you so sad and so
[1:36:40] downtrod well haven't you been here in
[1:36:42] Jerusalem haven't you heard this same
[1:36:45] Jesus whom we beli that was Messiah they
[1:36:48] have crucified him we laid him in a tomb
[1:36:50] and it's all
[1:36:52] over we thought this was
[1:36:55] him they wept and moaned and
[1:37:00] cried and so he began to expound the
[1:37:03] scriptures beginning in the book of
[1:37:05] Moses on and so for so many
[1:37:09] furlongs he begins to you ever walk with
[1:37:12] somebody and as you walk along all of a
[1:37:15] sudden you want to make a point and you

[1:37:26] another point you stop every you see
[1:37:28] what I'm saying you do that all the time

[1:37:33] scriptures
[1:37:35] concerning
[1:37:38] himself and all they got was
[1:37:43] heartburn did not our hearts burn within
[1:37:47] us as he spake to us along the way but
[1:37:51] the Bible says they compelled him to
[1:37:53] stay with
[1:37:54] them for the day was Far spent it's
[1:37:57] evening

[1:38:13] day was fars
[1:38:16] bent and they compelled him stay here

[1:38:35] ahead and

[1:39:07] with them in the
[1:39:09] evening Jesus said I am the bread which

[1:43:22] and Jesus said unto him the day of
[1:43:25] salvation this day is salvation come
[1:43:28] into this house for as much as
[1:43:31] also he also is the son of
[1:43:38] Abraham for the son of
[1:43:40] man here's his
[1:43:43] purpose is to come and to seek and to
[1:43:47] save that which was
[1:43:49] lost Now understand
[1:43:52] something you have to have possession of
[1:43:55] something before you say you lost
[1:44:03] it
[1:44:06] yeah you have to
[1:44:08] have possession of something before it
[1:44:11] can be
[1:44:14] lost let me expound on this for a moment
[1:44:17] because the prophetic
[1:44:19] Ministry
[1:44:21] is a son of man
[1:44:22] ministry that's right God is changing
[1:44:26] his
[1:44:27] form so that not everyone will recognize
[1:44:32] him only the
[1:44:34] elect in the unveiling of God brother
[1:44:37] brm says he came first as the
[1:44:39] prophet They
[1:44:41] Crucified him his own crucified him he
[1:44:45] came as the son of
[1:44:48] man then after the the Holy Spirit came
[1:44:52] he was then Son of God brother Brenham
[1:44:55] said Christ fulfills three offices in
[1:44:58] his lifetime in
[1:45:01] dispensations Son of Man prophetic
[1:45:04] Ministry Son of God as a mediator
[1:45:08] between God and man right and then son
[1:45:11] of David sitting on the throne in the
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:16] millennial then after the Holy Spirit he
[1:45:19] was then the Son of God God is
[1:45:21] Spirit he was the Holy Spirit Son of God
[1:45:25] he lived down through the church ages as
[1:45:26] Son of God now in the millennial he'll
[1:45:29] be the son of David sitting on the
[1:45:30] throne of his father David now watch
[1:45:32] this he is now the Son of God now and
[1:45:37] remember between Son of God and Son of
[1:45:39] David in the loudest inan Church age
[1:45:43] they put him out and in Luke he said he
[1:45:45] would be revealed as the son of man the
[1:45:48] prophet fulfilling the rest of the
[1:45:50] scriptures tie perfectly together son of
[1:45:54] man Son of God Son of David what is it
[1:45:57] it's the same God all the time yes just
[1:46:00] changing his form in morpha he just
[1:46:03] changed it it's a great drama to him
[1:46:07] he is acting it
[1:46:13] out his objective was to seek and to
[1:46:17] save that which was lost amen ain't
[1:46:20] saving
[1:46:21] everybody everybody ain't his that's
[1:46:26] right he does not correct those that are
[1:46:29] not his amen that's right the Bible says
[1:46:32] if you are without correction or
[1:46:35] chastisement you're
[1:46:38] illegitimate and God don't waste time on
[1:46:40] illegitimates
[1:46:42] do your thing right I didn't believe
[1:46:46] there was a God or never will be a god
[1:46:48] this and that yeah the Bible says the
[1:46:50] the fool has said in his heart there is
[1:46:53] no God you were born to be that

[1:49:55] sermon or two the within the son of man
[1:49:58] Ministry
[1:50:00] lies the title deed to your full
[1:50:06] inheritance yes
[1:50:08] sir yeah think about that just chew on
[1:50:11] that for a little
[1:50:14] bit remember the purpose of the son of
[1:50:18] man this is why I came to seek and to
[1:50:20] save that which was lost and all that
[1:50:24] the father hath given
[1:50:26] me oh just by chance you know you think
[1:50:30] God is up in heaven ringing his hands no
[1:50:33] thinking he's worried he's going to lose
[1:50:36] you as bad as you are and as carnal as
[1:50:39] you are and as unbelieving as you
[1:50:43] are God said I didn't call them because
[1:50:46] of their Works amen because their works
[1:50:50] stink right I didn't call them because
[1:50:52] of their Holiness because their
[1:50:53] righteousness is as filthy
[1:50:57] rags I called them because of
[1:51:00] election that before they were born
[1:51:03] neither having done good or evil I
[1:51:05] already set upon them a calling of
[1:51:11] election you had nothing to do with
[1:51:13] [Applause]
[1:51:16] it you had nothing to do with it it's
[1:51:20] All About Him Christ the
[1:51:22] mystery Christ down Through the Ages
[1:51:24] playing out his part in every
[1:51:30] age John 1:18 no man hath seen God at
[1:51:34] any
[1:51:35] time the only begotten son which is in
[1:51:38] the bosom of the father he hath declared
[1:51:42] him declare in Greek means to reveal to
[1:51:45] make known am you don't even know God
[1:51:48] except you know him through Christ
[1:51:53] that is the father's business you know
[1:51:55] that yes
[1:51:57] sir Luke 2:9 and he said unto them how
[1:52:00] is it that you sought me wish you not
[1:52:02] that I must be about my father's
[1:52:06] business John
[1:52:09] 6:37 all that the father has given me
[1:52:11] shall come to me and him that cometh to
[1:52:14] me I will know no wise cast out I came
[1:52:16] down from heaven not to do my own will
[1:52:19] but the will of him that sent me in this
[1:52:22] is the Father's will yes you want to
[1:52:25] know it this is the Father's will which
[1:52:28] has sent me that all which he hath given
[1:52:32] me I should lose nothing somebody say
[1:52:36] nothing
[1:52:38] NADA Nick
[1:52:41] new I don't care how you say
[1:52:44] it he he didn't lose none of
[1:52:48] them praise the Lord thank you Lord
[1:52:52] thank you Lord thou has given me a
[1:52:55] chance it's you holding me it's not me
[1:52:58] holding you it's not what I do it's what
[1:53:01] you have already
[1:53:03] done hallah my thank you Lord Wonder
[1:53:07] this is the will of him that sent me
[1:53:10] that everyone which seeth a son and
[1:53:12] believeth on him may have everlasting
[1:53:15] life and I will raise him up in the last
[1:53:18] day amen all
[1:53:21] right
[1:53:23] questions I I ain't even got to the
[1:53:26] questions
[1:53:28] yet so they were written here on this I
[1:53:32] transferred them to
[1:53:34] this what does the son of man mean or
[1:53:37] stand for according to the word of God
[1:53:40] you see if you're asking what does the
[1:53:43] son of man mean according to the word of
[1:53:45] God then you go to the word of God so
[1:53:47] who do they say that I the son of a Man
[1:53:50] Out Peter answers it Thou Art the Christ
[1:53:53] of God so it's a Bible answer is it not
[1:53:57] right what does the Revelation or
[1:54:01] manifestation of the son of man mean in
[1:54:04] this day or in this age so you got two
[1:54:07] questions what does the
[1:54:09] revelation of the son of man mean in
[1:54:12] this age or what does the manifestation
[1:54:15] of the son of man mean Revelation
[1:54:17] precedes manifestation amen you got to
[1:54:21] have Revelation then you
[1:54:23] manifest and once Revelation comes to
[1:54:26] you it becomes the manifested sons of
[1:54:29] God in that
[1:54:31] age okay we understand that
[1:54:38] then what does this question number
[1:54:40] three what does the son of man revealing
[1:54:42] the son of man mean
[1:54:45] today so I
[1:54:47] got cuz brother Brenham said says and if
[1:54:50] you listen to it on tape he says and I'm
[1:54:53] going to show you some quotes here but
[1:54:56] if you listen to the tape they said
[1:54:57] brother Brenham are you the son of man
[1:54:59] he said no I'm a son of man revealing to
[1:55:03] you the somebody say the he didn't say
[1:55:07] thee he said the how do you spell the t
[1:55:11] h e they didn't spell it the way that he
[1:55:14] said
[1:55:17] it I am a son of man revealing to you
[1:55:22] the son of man I'm just a prophet
[1:55:27] revealing to you the
[1:55:29] god of the
[1:55:31] prophets the son of man who is the son
[1:55:35] of man Christ amen all right
[1:55:39] now here's questions answers 1964 some
[1:55:43] say brother Brenham is the son of man I
[1:55:46] thought the pillar of fire was the son
[1:55:48] of man am I
[1:55:51] mistaken well that's a good question
[1:55:53] very good but I am
[1:55:55] not the son of man but a son of
[1:55:59] man now I put the T he in there so i'
[1:56:03] emphasize it but brother brand says I
[1:56:06] am uh not the son of man but a son of
[1:56:11] man there's quite a difference I am not
[1:56:14] the anointed son of
[1:56:17] man I don't claim to be his Prophet many
[1:56:19] times I said I don't think I catch
[1:56:21] myself on tape but I say sometimes
[1:56:23] because I want to give the term a
[1:56:25] prophet the English term means a
[1:56:27] preacher anybody knows get a dictionary
[1:56:29] see a prophet is a preacher under
[1:56:31] English dictionary but under Hebrew or
[1:56:34] Greek a prophet is a sear one who
[1:56:36] foresees things for tells things under
[1:56:38] the English interpretation Prophet is a
[1:56:40] Seer so I don't call myself anything but
[1:56:42] your brother I am your brother I just
[1:56:46] and you just regard me as brother Bill
[1:56:48] or brother brandham whatever you want to
[1:56:50] do that uh to do that about that that's
[1:56:54] fine what you believe keep that to
[1:56:58] yourself questions
[1:57:01] answers I am not he I am his
[1:57:04] servant amen and the pillar of fire is
[1:57:07] not he it's the spirit form which was
[1:57:10] upon the son of man and he come now to
[1:57:12] anoint sons of men to bring back a
[1:57:15] Ministry just exactly like he said it
[1:57:17] would be in order for the head and the
[1:57:18] rest of the body to come together
[1:57:21] wonderful
[1:57:25] so question number
[1:57:29] four how does the son of man reveal
[1:57:32] himself today as
[1:57:36] Abraham was in Luke
[1:57:41] 17:30 how does the son of man reveal
[1:57:44] himself today as it was with Abraham in
[1:57:47] the days of Luke 17:30 we we know Luke
[1:57:50] 17:30 but in the days of the revealing
[1:57:52] of the son of man
[1:57:56] so the same scenario watch this and we
[1:58:00] we we find the types and shadows within
[1:58:03] scriptures because as it was so shall it
[1:58:06] be as it was in the days of Noah gives
[1:58:08] us a pattern as it was in the days of
[1:58:10] Sodom gives us a pattern we can
[1:58:13] understand then by the pattern that we
[1:58:15] see the patterns all down through
[1:58:18] scripture they are types and shadows so
[1:58:21] we can understand the way that God
[1:58:22] reveals himself to Abraham and to Sarah
[1:58:26] it is an example of what God is going to
[1:58:28] do in this end
[1:58:30] time okay
[1:58:33] so uh God came down revealed himself to
[1:58:38] Abraham God had been speaking directly
[1:58:41] to Abraham about a promised seed
[1:58:44] remember Genesis 12 and God appeared
[1:58:48] unto Abraham and told him I'm I'm going
[1:58:49] to give you seed he's just a young man
[1:58:52] it's not until 25 years later and he's
[1:58:55] an old man and he's dead in body and
[1:58:57] Sarah's dead that God's going
[1:59:01] to Quicken the
[1:59:03] promise so we see our types and shadows
[1:59:06] I went a little fast threw that out
[1:59:08] there for just to get you
[1:59:11] thinking promise was given to Abraham
[1:59:13] but has to be produced or birthed
[1:59:16] through Sarah right so now God speaks to
[1:59:20] brother brandham as a prophet but it
[1:59:23] isn't until the Bride Comes to a
[1:59:27] maturity that she conceives the message
[1:59:30] or the word from the
[1:59:33] prophet she's got to be of age because
[1:59:36] she's been receiving seed since she's 16
[1:59:39] brother Ram said Abraham married Sarah
[1:59:41] when she was 16 and giving her seed seed
[1:59:45] seed they had had relationships all
[1:59:46] these years and she was barren
[1:59:50] okay she was
[1:59:52] Barren now I'm going to throw something
[1:59:54] out here that I'm going to explain to
[1:59:56] you a little bit later he said now when
[1:59:58] God changes them back he goes farther
[2:00:02] than just changing them back to being
[2:00:04] young again because when they were young
[2:00:07] she still didn't
[2:00:09] conceive so
[2:00:12] there's there's got to be something that
[2:00:14] God
[2:00:15] does he gives his name he said you're
[2:00:17] not Abram you're Abra you're not Sarah
[2:00:20] you're brother Braham said name change
[2:00:23] is familiar to all of us and he does it
[2:00:25] either because of a change or produces a
[2:00:29] change so the change of producing it
[2:00:32] watch and you look at it in the
[2:00:34] scriptures oh I know I'm getting ahead
[2:00:37] of myself but this is fun this is fun I
[2:00:41] like that even after they've got the
[2:00:43] promise and they're as good as dead yeah
[2:00:46] yeah he said he says Abraham fear not
[2:00:50] I'm going to be with you my covenant's
[2:00:52] going to be with you
[2:00:55] amen I love it God just said hey don't
[2:00:58] be afraid listen my Covenant is with you
[2:01:01] but then now watch he has spoken about a
[2:01:05] promised seed to Abraham this whole time
[2:01:09] but she is
[2:01:13] Barren and it never includes her by name
[2:01:17] it always says my C it with you Abraham
[2:01:21] Abraham Abraham it's to you you you
[2:01:23] Abraham Abraham but now he says Sarah
[2:01:27] come on shall bring forth a
[2:01:29] seed is well that Ishmael might live
[2:01:34] he's 15 years old when Isaac is born
[2:01:38] right through a denominational Woman by
[2:01:41] the name of
[2:01:45] Hagar and and Sarah saw in ishmail
[2:01:51] mocking Isaac when he was being weaned
[2:01:54] how many of you know that
[2:01:55] in and she got so mad she says she
[2:01:58] Stomps right over to Abraham I'll tell
[2:02:00] you what Abraham Abraham I saw her
[2:02:04] mocking kick her out for the bondswoman
[2:02:08] shall not be air with the free woman the
[2:02:11] Shar shall not be air with the
[2:02:15] wheat that's right denominations got
[2:02:18] nothing to do with that
[2:02:22] Bride on do you see these in
[2:02:26] types
[2:02:33] amen
[2:02:35] okay I'm going to I'm going to elaborate
[2:02:37] on that in just a
[2:02:38] minute let's see where I'm
[2:02:41] at wow I got two
[2:02:45] minutes question number four or no this
[2:02:49] question number
[2:02:51] five who is the Angel sent to Abraham's
[2:02:54] seed
[2:02:56] Elohim to reveal the Sodom sign
[2:03:00] the oh excuse me excuse me question
[2:03:03] number five somebody say five five okay
[2:03:06] I'm on five now did the fullness of God
[2:03:10] dwell in William brandham to reveal the
[2:03:13] son of man to the bride no the fullness
[2:03:16] of God only dwelt in Jesus Christ we
[2:03:19] have a partial what is called the
[2:03:20] earnest or the down payment which is the
[2:03:23] holy spirit but at the first
[2:03:26] resurrection we shall all be changed in
[2:03:29] a moment in the twinkling of an eye and
[2:03:32] then brother brandham said you will get
[2:03:34] the fullness of your adoption at the
[2:03:37] first
[2:03:38] resurrection and then I shall know him
[2:03:41] as he has known I shall be like him I
[2:03:44] don't know what it's going to be like
[2:03:46] when I get there all I know this I I
[2:03:49] will be like
[2:03:52] him God
[2:03:55] God who is the Angel this question say
[2:03:59] who is the Angel sent to Abraham's
[2:04:02] seed now I'm just reading it and they
[2:04:05] said Elohim to reveal the Sodom sign the
[2:04:09] prophet speaks of Billy Graham Oral
[2:04:11] Roberts and the third was through
[2:04:14] William Branham that Elohim reveal
[2:04:17] himself to the bride
[2:04:21] okay who is the Angel sent to Abraham's
[2:04:24] seed yes it is Abraham excuse me it is
[2:04:28] Elohim because when God comes to
[2:04:32] Abraham down in a form member in the
[2:04:35] plains of
[2:04:36] mammory comes down there are three men
[2:04:39] coming he says my Lord true
[2:04:42] Revelation remember lot sees the same
[2:04:44] group coming my lords false revelation
[2:04:48] yeah he says my
[2:04:51] Lord he sits down and eats flesh with
[2:04:55] them drinks milk and the two two
[2:04:59] Messengers went down to Sodom and he
[2:05:02] says that's a modern day Billy Graham
[2:05:04] and or Roberts
[2:05:06] right they were Deliverance
[2:05:09] angels to
[2:05:14] Sodom that's why he said I go and I
[2:05:17] preach and I get 40,000 converts and I
[2:05:19] come back next week and I can't find
[2:05:26] 40 they are messengers to Sodom are we
[2:05:30] together in that in fact brother Braham
[2:05:33] said this is the first
[2:05:34] age that he said that we have a
[2:05:37] messenger to the age that has the H at
[2:05:42] the end of his
[2:05:44] name he said Graham is six letters
[2:05:47] number of men

[2:09:35] angels before huh amen Amen on so did
[2:09:41] the fullness of God dwell in brother
[2:09:42] brandom no fullness of God dwelt only in
[2:09:46] the in Jesus Christ CHR the angel he
[2:09:50] speaks through this angel speaks through
[2:09:53] the seven Church age
[2:09:55] messenger and he preaches what God tells
[2:09:58] him to say because remember it was God
[2:10:00] Elohim that met with Abraham he said oh
[2:10:04] it's the Lord Elohim right so here's the
[2:10:08] messenger coming to
[2:10:10] Abraham you see now without the
[2:10:13] revelation of the Holy Spirit you're not
[2:10:15] going to get
[2:10:16] it I can tell you this stuff we can
[2:10:20] declare it ever so eloquently or poorly
[2:10:23] however way you want to look at it but
[2:10:26] the Holy Spirit alone is a Divine
[2:10:28] revealer of the word in Christ The
[2:10:31] Mystery of God revealed let me give you
[2:10:32] a couple more quotes here and
[2:10:36] man yeah uh I will quit when I'm
[2:10:41] done the Holy Ghost alone is the
[2:10:43] revealer of the divine revelation of
[2:10:45] Christ and has been in all ages amen
[2:10:49] it's the Holy Ghost without the Holy
[2:10:50] Ghost you see how important the Holy
[2:10:52] Ghost is yes you see why foolish virgin
[2:10:54] is foolish yeah cuz she's bride material
[2:10:59] but the reason she's foolish she got no
[2:11:01] oil she's got no Holy Spirit there's no
[2:11:10] Revelation loud see in church age
[2:11:12] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:11:14] you can never have your eyes open to
[2:11:17] spiritual revelation of the word a man
[2:11:19] without the spirit is blind to God and
[2:11:21] His
[2:11:23] truth you guys catch
[2:11:28] that question number
[2:11:31] eight Billy Graham Oral Roberts and
[2:11:34] brandham have left where are we in the
[2:11:38] scriptures very good question because
[2:11:40] that's the eschatology where are we man
[2:11:43] give me the timeline if we were to say
[2:11:45] in the timeline of laiaa and this and
[2:11:48] that where are we I mean if Oral Roberts
[2:11:51] and Billy Graham have come and brother
[2:11:53] Brenham has come the messenger and he
[2:11:55] comes at the end of the
[2:11:57] age then where are we well then we have
[2:12:00] to go back to the Book of
[2:12:03] Genesis and you look at Abraham I'm
[2:12:06] going to tell you and I'm not going to
[2:12:07] go back through all of this but I want
[2:12:09] you to do your homework watch this and I
[2:12:12] believe we are between Genesis 17 and
[2:12:15] Genesis 21 write that down
[2:12:18] and remember that God time means nothing
[2:12:22] to
[2:12:22] God A Day With God is as a thousand
[2:12:27] years
[2:12:29] so if it was in Abraham's life in 25
[2:12:33] years transpires we go from Genesis 12
[2:12:36] 13 14 15 16 17 we go we see MDC we see
[2:12:41] God coming to him we see a name change
[2:12:44] and everything but what's really
[2:12:47] interesting and let me see
[2:12:53] here
[2:12:54] remember in Genesis CH 20 they're turned
[2:12:58] back is that
[2:13:00] right and yet in Genesis 19 it says and
[2:13:03] they were of old
[2:13:06] age so now God changes and turns them
[2:13:09] back and brother Ram says watch aimc
[2:13:13] looks at Sarah and says Oho I want
[2:13:16] her
[2:13:19] a
[2:13:21] 75-year-old
[2:13:23] woman with
[2:13:25] flab and
[2:13:30] wrinkles I mean come
[2:13:33] on aimc he's got a
[2:13:37] kingdom
[2:13:41] Sarah French say o la
[2:13:46] la I can't wait he brother Bram says
[2:13:50] there he is aimc he took his shower took
[2:13:53] his bath he got the oils on him man he
[2:13:56] got his hands behind his back he says
[2:13:58] ooo in the morning he said I'll watch
[2:14:01] his toes wiggle he says and then all of
[2:14:05] a sudden God says you return the man his
[2:14:09] wife or you're a dead man that's right
[2:14:13] yeah but Lord you know I didn't touch
[2:14:15] her yeah because I kept you from
[2:14:17] touching
[2:14:18] don't sit there and give me your little
[2:14:22] righteousness return this man let him
[2:14:25] and if he don't pray for you your whole
[2:14:28] Kingdom Satan your Kingdom's going down
[2:14:32] Satan your Kingdom's going down aimc
[2:14:36] your Kingdom's going
[2:14:39] down so he says okay man he goes ahead
[2:14:43] and he returns her to Abraham woo pray
[2:14:47] for me
[2:14:48] Abraham and ailec gives him
[2:14:53] gifts
[2:14:54] so watch she doesn't conceive
[2:14:58] seed bear with me now for just
[2:15:01] another they're turned back
[2:15:05] young in Genesis 21 Sarah conceives
[2:15:10] Isa she
[2:15:12] couldn't as an old dead woman who was
[2:15:16] Barren are we get amen so there had to
[2:15:20] be something that
[2:15:22] happened so in Genesis 21 Sarah
[2:15:25] conceives Isaac gives
[2:15:28] birth and Abraham weans Isaac and
[2:15:32] Ishmael mocks Isaac when he's 15 years
[2:15:35] old Isaac is 15 remember he was first
[2:15:38] born and remember it was Grievous unto
[2:15:42] Abraham he cries out oh that ishel might
[2:15:46] live
[2:15:48] thinking that's his seed and God said it
[2:15:51] ain't through denominational Hagar it's
[2:15:55] going to be through Sarah thy
[2:15:58] wife Hagar was never
[2:16:02] considered his
[2:16:09] wife in fact God had to to correct
[2:16:12] Abraham said let it not be Grievous unto
[2:16:14] you quit your whining Abraham
[2:16:18] yeah that's what he told let this not be
[2:16:20] Grievous it ain't going to be ishmail no
[2:16:25] see and so you find
[2:16:29] out that the Shucks not air with the
[2:16:31] wheat so somewhere
[2:16:33] between Genesis
[2:16:36] 17 onto where we are at right now of the
[2:16:40] promised seed because there's got to be
[2:16:41] a change before the promised son can
[2:16:45] come musicians if you
[2:16:52] come let me see did I
[2:16:55] answer Billy Graham Oral Roberts brandom
[2:16:58] have left us scene where we at in the
[2:17:00] scriptures I just showed
[2:17:02] you we could take even more time but I
[2:17:05] think if you go and you look in Genesis
[2:17:08] and start reading through you see how it
[2:17:11] transpires with him and
[2:17:14] when Abraham and Sarah were as good as
[2:17:19] dead that's when God performs his word y
[2:17:23] I want you to understand we we don't
[2:17:25] have to drum nothing up we don't have to
[2:17:28] get you emotional we don't have to get
[2:17:29] you excited we don't I don't have to get
[2:17:31] up here and scream and holler and Shout
[2:17:34] I believe in that I I I scream and
[2:17:36] holler and Shout at times
[2:17:41] amen we could have the music get you all
[2:17:45] emotional yeah
[2:17:48] [Music]
[2:17:50] or you just catch it in the
[2:17:53] Simplicity of the word and you go oh
[2:17:58] my you me to tell me that as God dealt
[2:18:02] with
[2:18:03] Abraham and he finally had to show
[2:18:05] Abraham Abraham is you got nothing to do
[2:18:07] with
[2:18:09] this Abraham I have made my Covenant
[2:18:12] with thee but watch now he says now and
[2:18:16] Sarah I have made a covenant with thee
[2:18:19] also yes that through thee Hallelujah
[2:18:23] yes you're going to bring forth the
[2:18:26] promised
[2:18:27] son amen the right one at the right
[2:18:35] time okay now watch this I'm not going
[2:18:37] to let you go without understanding
[2:18:43] this Sarah when she hears the angel say
[2:18:48] she's going to have a seed what does she
[2:18:50] do she
[2:18:54] laughs can I show you a couple quotes
[2:18:56] here before we go because brother
[2:19:00] Brenham says as Abraham and Sarah
[2:19:03] received their sign he said so will
[2:19:06] these in the last day receive the same
[2:19:08] sign here it is let me find what's
[2:19:13] the mark of the beast and seal of God
[2:19:16] 1961 the last sign was to be M the
[2:19:20] Messiah
[2:19:22] sign what was the last sign that Abraham
[2:19:24] just before Sodom burned you want to
[2:19:27] know where we're at you want to know
[2:19:29] what's the last sign before Sodom burned
[2:19:31] Angel stood there God himself in flesh
[2:19:34] who was it
[2:19:35] Elohim what took that haven't we Abraham
[2:19:39] called him Elohim God stood there a
[2:19:42] stranger and watch what he called
[2:19:44] Abraham called Abraham his new name he
[2:19:47] just got it in a few days before instead
[2:19:50] of Abram he was
[2:19:52] Abraham called Sarai her a princess name
[2:19:55] n Abraham where's your wife
[2:19:58] Sarah how do you know he was married how
[2:20:02] do you know he had a wife how do you
[2:20:03] know her name was Sarah said she's in
[2:20:06] the tent behind
[2:20:09] you and Sarah in her heart laughed and
[2:20:12] said I would ever have joy with my Lord
[2:20:16] seeing I'm old and pass a of bearing
[2:20:18] he's too
[2:20:19] old I'm too old he's too old an angel
[2:20:23] said why did Sarah
[2:20:25] laugh saying in her heart it just can't
[2:20:28] happen Jesus said as it was in the days
[2:20:31] of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[2:20:34] the son of man who is this son of man
[2:20:37] what about the coming where are we at
[2:20:39] did you see the sign given to
[2:20:42] Abraham okay it wasn't so from the
[2:20:45] beginning 61 remember let me tell you
[2:20:48] thus sayith the spirit of God that's on
[2:20:50] me this is the last sign to the Gentile
[2:20:54] Church before the
[2:20:57] Rapture thus saith the word of God thus
[2:21:00] saith the holy spirit that speaks that
[2:21:03] knows The Secret of Heart thus sayith
[2:21:05] the Lord you're receiving your last
[2:21:10] call proving his word 65 remember
[2:21:14] Abraham's group never received one more
[2:21:16] sign from God until the promised son
[2:21:19] arrived how many knows that's true sign
[2:21:23] and
[2:21:24] discernment the Royal Seed of Abraham
[2:21:27] let me hear you let me tell you thus
[2:21:30] sayith the Lord you're receiving your
[2:21:32] last
[2:21:33] sign that's according to the
[2:21:35] scriptures the revelation of God that's
[2:21:37] in my heart it speaks that this is the
[2:21:39] truth I trust that you will believe it
[2:21:41] to be the
[2:21:46] truth
[2:21:53] Abraham's Grace Covenant
[2:21:56] 1961 I got one more quote and one more
[2:22:00] scripture what's the next thing after
[2:22:02] this sign goes
[2:22:03] away God's going to condition Abraham's
[2:22:06] children getting ready to receive the
[2:22:08] promised son you know what's happening
[2:22:10] right now you're being conditioned
[2:22:15] yes how we going to receive him we can't
[2:22:18] receive him in these
[2:22:21] bodies what's he doing the last sign
[2:22:24] before the
[2:22:25] Transfiguration the last sign before the
[2:22:28] Rapture for most any time the atomic
[2:22:30] bomb's going to destroy the world before
[2:22:33] it screams into the
[2:22:36] uh the tapes Jesus is
[2:22:39] coming we which are alive and remain
[2:22:42] shall not prevent and hinder them which
[2:22:44] are uh asleep dead for the Trump of God
[2:22:47] shall sound the dead and Christ shall
[2:22:49] rise we which are alive shall be changed
[2:22:52] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[2:22:54] old man will be young and old wom will
[2:22:56] be young again will be conditioned to
[2:22:59] meet the promised coming son Glory
[2:23:01] Hallelujah next thing in God's order
[2:23:04] God's conditioning you right now the
[2:23:06] next thing we're looking for is change
[2:23:07] in body in a moment in twinkling of an
[2:23:09] eye what happen just as the angel had
[2:23:12] his back turned and showing that sign to
[2:23:15] Abraham he brought everything down
[2:23:16] through justification sanctification
[2:23:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost placing of
[2:23:20] son's gifts and order come out and then
[2:23:23] showing his last sign Before Destruction
[2:23:26] where are we at brother Ron here we're
[2:23:29] at
[2:23:31] changed why do we have to be changed
[2:23:33] it's totally impossible for that old man
[2:23:35] to have sexual relationship with his
[2:23:38] wife it's totally impossible for her to
[2:23:40] conceive and bear a
[2:23:43] child it was
[2:23:45] only and the only way it could could be
[2:23:47] done would be have to be transformation
[2:23:49] of her body he had lived with since she
[2:23:51] was 18 years old or 16 his half sister
[2:23:55] he married her young she was Barren and
[2:23:57] he was sterile you see it so he had to
[2:24:00] change her physical being to receive the
[2:24:02] sun now in closing the Bible says
[2:24:05] Hebrews
[2:24:07] 11 through
[2:24:12] faith also Sarah herself receiv received
[2:24:15] strength amen to conceive seed
[2:24:19] amen who was delivered of a child when

[2:25:13] you I I I trust that this was okay
[2:25:18] I didn't really preach I just kind of
[2:25:20] took some teaching here and some quotes
[2:25:24] because these were good questions very
[2:25:26] good
[2:25:28] question who is the son of
[2:25:31] man what is this message all
[2:25:34] about is it just church
[2:25:37] order have we condensed the prophet's
[2:25:40] message to long hair and a long dress is
[2:25:44] that
[2:25:45] it well our religion
[2:25:49] says is that what you young people say
[2:25:53] well our religion that's what it teaches
[2:25:55] us then you're no different than a
[2:25:57] hutterite or an
[2:25:59] Amish our religion
[2:26:04] says but did God ever speak to
[2:26:07] you I tell you what when I
[2:26:11] lha hippie out of Southern
[2:26:14] California dope smoking listening to
[2:26:17] rock and roll and surfing every day and
[2:26:19] thinking that was what life was all
[2:26:24] about and then God gets a hold of me and
[2:26:27] shakes me like a bulldog on a rag
[2:26:34] doll and I'm still shook
[2:26:39] up the longer that I serve God in this
[2:26:43] message the clearer it becomes
[2:26:47] amen not more obscure the clearer
[2:26:52] amen the questions that I even had as a
[2:26:55] young man I don't have anymore right I'm
[2:26:59] beyond I I I'm to the place where beyond
[2:27:02] the threshold
[2:27:06] threshold they say when the bombers
[2:27:08] during the second world war they had a
[2:27:12] threshold point of no return what was it
[2:27:16] point of no return
[2:27:18] point of no
[2:27:24] return I'm
[2:27:27] there I am there no
[2:27:32] returning if none go with me still will
[2:27:36] I
[2:27:37] follow amen you can't talk me out of it
[2:27:40] and you can't talk me into it amen
[2:27:43] that's right because if somebody talks
[2:27:46] you into into believing this somebody
[2:27:48] can talk you out of it that's right but
[2:27:50] if God reveals it to you guess what
[2:27:53] ain't no devil in
[2:27:55] hell ain't nothing going to shake
[2:27:58] you that's why you know what some of you
