you want to remember for the war and pray Lord be with him the Wallace family will be traveling up to Canada visit families so pray the Lord goes with wallaces and ask you to remember my sister Carrie she lives up in Calgary and she's been battling with Ms for a number of years now and she I found out yesterday she went in for a surgery for a brain bleed and even though she was in the hospital but surgery apparently went well but now there's hoping that she recovers quickly so I'd ask that you remember her in prayer and most of all the Lord would deal with their heart she's one of those prodigals has been away for so long he's more than able I believe that tonight Amen brother Ron's going to come and give an update on brother Neil and take our request to the Lord tonight [Music] God bless you all this evening I'll give you an update with brother Neil Mater as you know that he had what they call arterial dissection which is a part of the aorta there at the heart and the wall of the aorta separated and when it does and it pulls away there's layers inside of the vein and when it does it makes a bulge but it didn't burst they said that was the first mirror actually the ambulance driver said we have aortic descent dissection here and they say 95 percent chance he won't make it to the hospital [Music] when he got to the hospital they had to transfer him to another hospital so they didn't even do it by ambulance they did it by uh air ambulance and so there was multitudes of complications going into the surgery let me put it real simple in layman's terms because we not knowing all of the terminology the doctors use but the doctor explained it to me today he said what happened is when this vein begins to separate all of the junk he calls it the trash all of the trash that separates inside that that artery wall now gets threat uh thrust through the body through the vascular system and so all of the trash they said has gone to the extremities now you know the smallest blood vessels in the body the capillaries are in the toes the digits your nose those are the smallest so if you get that clogged up then you have a discoloration because oxygen is not getting to those extremities his toes have turned purple his fingertips uh his nose and they're doing everything that they can the doctor told me today I spoke to the surgeon Dr Savage he said we're doing everything we know we're doing dialysis to help to try to to clean the blood uh and everything but said we have no remedy for this and I thought okay I have a court of appeal Hallelujah when doctors say we have done everything we can yes stand back because now Dr Jesus I believe that God who can raise the dead he can who he who made the body he who made the whole system God all you got to do is just come down let your angels go by touch him he he needs he he needs a greater Miracle right now than he's ever needed amen so I don't want us to slack off on the prayer I want us how many of you say I'll remember brother Neil I'll call his name mornings evenings when I go to bed when you have your your devotions call his name out he needs it the family needs it yes amen also too sister Rebecca my daughter did not have her second chemotherapy treatment today because her white blood cells were not high enough and so now I don't understand all the the deal but it's got to be so high for them to be able to come in and do whatever they got to do and so it'll be another week for that so just remember her in prayer but how many of you have got a need tonight say I need God to come down physical mental spiritual he is Jehovah heavenly father as we lift our hands before you this evening we bring these prayer requests to you each one that has been been read and spoken father we bring them before you but right now I'm I'm asking for the angels of Mercy to now go and to be at the bedside of our brother Neil father the doctors have doctored they've cut they've given the medication but Lord It's You that causes the healing to the body we're asking father that the great virtue of the blood of Jesus Christ you said by your stripes we are healed I'm asking father let that healing virtue be his portion this evening we commit everything into thy hands we believe you and we trust you and we call upon that mighty name in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen

you amen as we change the order of the service we've got a brother that's been here sojourning with us for several months now Brother Martin malumba and he is a minister of the Gospel he's been ministering in almost every weekend or somewhere if you don't see him here on Sundays because he's away Ministry and so I've asked him to go ahead and take tonight's service Brother Martin malumbi's originally from Congo so I want you to pay close attention and everything and and you pull on the gift amen and you making uh feel that he's being pulled on okay amen don't let him be up here and and everything because it's it's not the man it's the gift amen so we're gonna sing that song once again I stand in all of you and as we do we're going to ask our brother martin malumba if he'll come out

stand in all of you I stand I stand in all of you holy God to who all Praises do I stand in awe of you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it is uh certainly a privilege to be in the house of the Lord without any delay will take our Bibles are going to read in the book of Hebrews chapter 1. verse 7 and we'll skip to verse 14. and to the angels He said who maketh his Angel spirits and Minister and his ministers a flame of fire verse 14 are they not all ministering Spirits sent from or send forth to them to minister for them who shall be heirs or salvation shall we pray Heavenly Father once again we're standing in thy presence because it is not a privilege but it is by your grace father because we were lost and casting the darkness away from thy presence but the blood came about and restore the father God the pathway again we do not take this time just as another routine but Lord we take into consideration that in the Garden of Eden such a moment were taking place and when the men step out of law father God the light you had the fellowship with them Father and they knew how to proceed onto the next day father unto us tonight so as we stand in thy presence may you lead us as we ask and pray in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated uh as the pastor said it previously I am a brother martin mulumba I've been uh here in Arizona for about seven months and uh the Lord has relocated me from Colorado where I lived for the last 10 years and in the journey he has allowed us to labor in different places by his grace and here we are now at a different stage of the work and I've been also partaking and participating to the services here for the last seven months it has been surely uh a journey that I didn't think about that one day I'll find myself in such a environment but uh he pushed for two years in Colorado you have to go you have to go I did not know what he had in store but he knew what he had in store only had to obey when he told me to come and when I was ready to come or when At Last I obeyed him he uh he told me to reach out to brother Joshua mukibai one of the deacons in the church I did not know everything that he was here and through when I got here then he introduced me by God's grace with her brother Warren and from Brother Warren we went to Mexico and have been going on to Mexico since so back to back and here now I was one of I believe last year uh I wanted to talk to the pastor regarding some other stuff but I did not know how to proceed and I did not want it to be um something man-made but uh while I was sitting there and praying when I finished he was just say standing there and waiting for me instead and he came and he started talking to me about some other things and I didn't even speak to him about what I wanted to to talk to him and when we met again then we shared everything that I could share about my life you know when you have a 30 years live it's uh with one hour meeting it's very you have to condense everything and here now we are to do God's work and to labor for him and he has put on my heart to share a little sermon that looking at it I dodged the first one that he had given me because I felt it was a little too tough on me to bring it but has his God then he has his program he always shows that he's the one leading uh he gave it to another Minister here and he preached it so that was a way for me to understand like you have to do what I tell you to do so and now tonight I am convinced that I have to bring this one here um he showed it twice the third time he came through somebody else and the fourth time he came to me this afternoon when I seated there and the whole entire sermon came through but abrana Maisie was preaching and I said well at least people if they doubt on it they can go back to brother Branham and compare it they can go back to the message and the Bible they can check it out so by God's grace you'll be praying for me um as will be uh traveling standing here for the next few minutes hopefully I won't be too long or too short but just give exactly what the Lord has in store for us uh for tonight I'm going to take um a little subject on work of the ministry we understand that as Believers we are workers in God's Vineyard and we see in the book of Hebrews that Paul the seed the prophet to the Gentiles or the first prophet to the Gentiles had a different type of churches that he dealt with the Corinthians and the Philippians and the Hebrews and each one of them had a portion of work or a different stage of the ministry that they found themselves in and to each one of them he was dealing with them according to the level and the prophet says and shows us that that's where the church has to go back to because that was at the standard that we have as a pattern or as an example to go back to and these people the way churches or cities in areas where they called Colossians because they were part of Colossus or Hebrews because they offer set on tribe or if a certain country but these things are given to us with the understanding of the Revelation that it is a stage of the ministry that's why we're taking the work of the ministry we've come across the journey as the Lord has brought his servants around and brought different messages of coming out of Egypt um bringing it about and they were shown throughout the desert and different things that were happening those who wanted to take Moses place and those who wanted to become what Moses was those who only stay on this side Journey but on this night we want to be in the land we want to be in our position we want to be where we are because after all these years that this church have been around surely different stages different levels different experiences different things that people have been able to achieve therefore it shows us that therefore there's nothing new Under the Sun to every season there's a purpose when you find yourself in the stage where you are in there's a reason to it and when the Lord comes around to awaken us to push us forward there is a reason for it and now it requires now to the people to receive it and capitalize upon it otherwise it just becomes a church routine let's go let's let's listen to another sermon let's go and see who's preaching I'm not really convinced about it so as Ministry I don't think you should preach to me and all that then we start spinning around but then when the Joshua brought the people in the land they say look at the land you have so much land 15 year old learn to conquer 12 two-year-old land to conquer 50 year old than to conquer and all these people were lands that had to be conquered and has they found themselves in the land then the question was how do we conquer because we do come and we listen sermons after sermons we say Amen we are the bride yes of course we are the bride because this message was sent to the bride but yet at the same time in every church we understand this two three types of Believers and Believers so-called believer the unbeliever and all these people when they find themselves in this environments are we going to call the unbeliever because they are just in the church because it is also a stage because the child is born two years old he doesn't understand what's going on in the church what do we go to church it's a statue of the ministry we go to church I follow the parents it's it's a makeup believer because it just understand like you know we have to go daddy say we have to go and at times that it has to impose himself we have to go to church because we know we have to go to church but there's also those who are believers I believe this message will follow my heart they are in the message it is a stage of the ministry but then there's also another stage of adoption where somebody comes to understand like Oh I'm a minister God has called me for this I I am this I am that and all those positions we have in the church but then in that position that we have in the church that's where the work of the ministry steps into view because we see that in the word Jesus says John 14 26 that but when the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you the Lord is showing that the church was at a certain stage you go to the upper room you receive the Holy Ghost through all these experiences as some of us have dates place and timing and everything like I received the Holy Ghost at this stage but then now the person now gets into the work different level of experience on what you do and how you do it and Jesus said when the Holy Spirit shall come he shall teach you all things and when he's teaching you all things is also teaching you on how to work the portion of land that you have to conquer because uh the the rubinites and the rest of them let were outside of the land where that was given to them on this side Jordan because he was on the eastern part of the land but they did not cross all the way into the land but now to those of us who have come into the land we have now a position in our land and at times we have already conquered Our Land I am a minister I'm not out there drinking smoking and doing all these stupid things because I am into my land but then Joshua says but there's still much more land to conquer but now to this person now at times when we get to that level we forget like you know oh I've made it yeah that's it I can just like you know cross my legs no Joshua said there's more land to conquer and as now the land comes into view the Holy Spirit should come to teach us on how to conquer the land because in the book of Joshua 13 the Bible said balam also the son of of of beer the soothsayer did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them the people come came into the land they find like you know hey this is one of the guy who caused us so much trouble the Nicolaitans the balamism the religion religion of Jezebel all these things we've slayed them we not under somebody trying to dominate upon us we're not an organization we're not after this or that Pastor or this great man or that great man they did slay balam they did remove all the filthy things among them but then in Joshua chapter 1 chapter 1 uh chapter let me find it when the autopilot kicks in it's always hard to follow up with the notes yeah in Joshua they said we're going to actually judge you subject chapter one now after the death of Joshua it came to pass that the children of Israel asked the Lord saying who shall go up for us against the Canaanite first to fight against them because they were already in the land and the Holy Spirit that had to be in a relationship with people because verbanum teaches us you cannot come on the pulpit get married do whatsoever without being filled with the Holy Spirit here now we have also they said the children of Israel standing there looking at the scene they say well we have a challenge there are invasions in the land disease and financial issues and health risk and all these things they say now who shall go before us because there's a situation in the land we find ourselves that hey work must be done but then they are also among us we understand like you know we have people among us who are mature who are blessed who are placed in the body but then who shall go in this time in this position go and do the work for us so now we understand now in this position now the Lord said Judah shall go up behold I have delivered the land into his hand and Judah said unto see me on his brother come up with me unto my lot that we may fight against the Canaanite and likewise will I will go with the into dialogue Simon went with him so in this case Simon comes up and said well you have a Ministry and you call for my help and will go now to fight that of course the Lord have already given us Victory we'll go and you'll you are the Overcomer you are the pure bride you've overcame laodicea and all these things but now here now another stage of the work in the land not outside of the land where we stand and we look at the situation we understand what shall we do what kind of person shall we have go before us to fight in this situation the Lord said we have a brother here we have a sister here who have kept her virtue all these years I believe that she's the right person to be the testimony for the people we have a minister here we have somebody in the church in the body that has to go and do the work but now this person now goes into a land he has the promise he has the understanding that the Lord has given me this ministry he has given me the work to do but then when it goes now as the brother brought him said when I go into the field it's if the Lord told me to go into the field I am assured that I'll have victory that he will take care of me but now the reason now the Lord is bringing out this element is to paint the picture that while we still here on Earth we have to be able to understand what's going on in the land because Jim says confess your sin one to another but then in this situation now they were able to see Judah was able to say like I have this work to do but I'm unable with myself to go do it all by myself I need a little bit of help here I need a little bit of help there because e Judah understood also that he has people in the church that are also placed filled with the spirit strong enough with experiences to be able to help me in this journey but then when now we find ourselves in the church Barbarian says in the influence it says when are you have people ministers who are not consecrated then people start falling into immorality why because people thought the fact that we have our titles it's good enough for us people talk like it's enough just to sit down and listen to a sermon be called message believer and that should do it but then in that condition the Lord start Awakening them he said after the death of Joshua look at the situation arises after you've listened to all these sermons after you've listened to all these tapes look at the condition of the land because the land is being invited invaded because the Lord said that when you go into the land you shall destroy everything do not leave a one single thing of it she may look so nice when you look at her appearance you say like oh she talks nice all she does the Lord said destroy everything he comes and he shows you how beautiful you are and all these things there's a danger behind it because the descending he did in the god in the Garden of Eden through serpent University she went to school she'll learn all these things but then she did not see the danger coming from removing her from her position to the position she's being placed now because even in this last day the vision was given to the prophet said because of the right given to her given to the church given to her she can now Proclaim herself as if she was something that she was not previously you are beautiful you are already beautiful you are the Church of God but then as the pressure was coming getting closer to the people the people themselves have to understand they had to be Anointed with Israel to be able to see the danger in the land because many times the biggest threat is to have somebody in the church as we have seen it going around the country somebody comes in the church and pretty soon somebody starts shooting people in the church but nobody was able to detect and see the danger coming why because the channel of communication between God and the people have been clogged because people were not in relationship anymore with God because of the work of the Lord was put aside by the red given to them the church had access to the money the church had access to all the Privileges oh why should we pray week I work I have money I have made my investments under the age of uh of uh of um West labor Branham says Wesley said take all you can give all you can save all you can you have the that privilege also today take all you can give all you can save all you can but then in the midst of that time what's going on in the land what's going on with the ministry where is the ministry standing at people were looking not understanding that the time in which we are living in all the wealth is given to laodicea is to Blind her blind wretched naked and don't know it because why the right that was given to her was given to her to put her in that position and through that the Lord said the people said who shall go for us in this situation then Judah has to rise up then Simeon has to rise up and as now Judah and Simeon they were rising and going to fight against these people they were things that had to be taken into consideration people had to know what kind of spirit they were dealing with I am a 15 year old girl my body started changing and getting all this new feelings in the body somebody has to be aware of what kind of invasion that is because the invasion of the United States is through all the media and through all these things and from the United States through the entire world and in the body of Christ Pastor father mother all the all of us each one in his place have these invasions and when these invasions are taking place the Lord has to come on the scene but then when after we pray after we speak after we've been through all prayer there's no answer something has went wrong because George Joshua said Lord you have given us the land how come we're losing all these people because something has happened in the land but then by God's grace he said rise up and as the Lord said Judah shall go up behold I have delivered the land into his hand the Lord has delivered Adam to you but then it does not mean since he has given that to you then we just like you know sit down and close our eyes and let's look and see whatever ah you you're good you'll be just fine no the Lord is awakening us that Joshua is gone but there's still much work to be done the ministry that we have had today the prophet has come physically we have seen him do all that he had to do and physically we've seen the body go do the soul being Eternal though the same angel that was with him is he with us today now the Awakening now of our mind with our eyes is to see what's going on in the land because the danger is so night the danger is so close we go to church time after time you just see the level of spirituality keeps going down and down and down and down why when you look because of wealth because of privileges for those in the third world countries they will pray so much just because they have need of food not necessarily to grow up in the spirit and once they get food there's no more need to pray the Lord now is Awakening the people he said when the Holy Spirit shall come he has to teach you all things as the pastor showed it here look at what's going on with the Baptist Church they're getting all this speaking in tongue left and right but then when you look in the word you find that when Jesus was dying on the cross that's when he died with tongues the time of transition between the time given to the Jews to receive the Messiah was running out and the same time the same way it happened with them the same time the same way also is happening with us where people find themselves in all these luxurious environment luxurious homes the Lord is showing them but look at the impending disaster the Lord has to open the eyes for them to be aware of what's going on in the land otherwise it's just another church routine let's go let's listen to a sermon but then when the spirit comes and said awaken thou sleepest look at the dangers at the door because Matthew 25 he said like while the rest of them they were sitting there they were just like you know okay we are the Holy Spirit yeah we'll get to it sometimes let me get married first let me have my money first let me work first why would they pushing a little bit for later on the reception of the Holy Spirit because they were busy because they had things to do when you look at it it's real our pastor these days really you have to understand yeah I understand you but that's not the word we will understand you as human beings but the word does not change Jesus Christ being the same yesterday today and forever Lord I have been doing this I've been paying my tithes here what is the do you tied to God he doesn't need your tight he needs you because what good is it for a wife to just leave the food on the table the husband comes home but she's not around it needs the whole thing to be set up he needs the whole statue of the perfect man to be built up from your virtue to head all the Seven Virtues it's not just you know for this time I don't have time it's very legitimate for me to go work I don't have time to study the word as much as I wanted to study but then the impending disaster will come to strike you just at the place where you don't have knowledge but then it required you to be awakened to have the necessary knowledge to face the impending disaster because when the voice said like behold the bridegroom is here go meet him it's not a physical move that she is standing there at a certain place but it's a daily walk with him and that belly walk requires not just a opening of a scripture in the morning two verses I'm ready and then let Jesus see you tonight no it's a daily walk it's a every minute walk because there was so much land to conquer and as the Lord the land has to be conquered the Lord has to awaken what's going on within ourselves to understand like look in this area of your life look at what's going on when the Holy Spirit shall come he shall teach you all things and when he's teaching you old things he's being a gentleman watch here read here live this year make your skirt a little longer cover yourself a little bit remove all those extensions don't pinch your hair this way present yourself this way very simple very in a gentleman way but hey the way it does it very foolish to men you know I'm still young I have to put this because the brothers he has a makeup in those Brothers he has a makeup in those sisters for you to meet according to his word because Samson thought he was smarter I am powerful when I go out there I just break everything I don't play with girls you know I don't play with boys but the way it came to him he did not see the impending disaster how are you sister God bless you serpent University they know the language they know the language they study you the message is given to everyone because the unbeliever in the church will learn the language on how to speak to you and you only see the disaster when you get into that relationship and they'll be way too late without the hood this Holy Spirit when the disaster kicks in you just find yourself that I've lost it but then the Lord says you have to work you need to cry in the spirit Lord reveal it unto us because I believe I am seed I have overcome all these years I've been 12 years old 15 years old and all this I've overcome all this I've preached so many sermons I've sung so many songs I've done all this that's good but look the road ahead there's so much work to remain Jesus said he that loves me keeps my commandment the Commandment is given to us to watch and pray it's not always mystery there's mystery that I am this I am that glory be to God yes that's good but do you see the impending disaster because the devil is not afraid of any one of us you cry you shout and I am this I am that yeah that's fine you're standing there is waiting for you right at the door once you get into your car you turn up the same music to the same music you go home you watch the same movies what is church attendance to us then you understand because he knows us very well he has six thousand years of experience more than any one of us combined he knows how to address us he knows that you know with you I will not come as an unbeliever with pens and nails and all this no he will just like but do you think really brother Branham said everything right he will lead you right in the same Bible that you read every day to start showing you mistakes in the message before you know it like somebody at the at the sea takes the clothes and puts it right there it gets in the water before he knows it is already there but the clothes are still here slowly but surely you've gone away and you don't understand anymore before you know it look at those extensions look at those short skirts you don't know how it happened because you were not able to see the impending disaster because you were blind of what was taking place before you but the Bible says Deuteronomy 21 if a man verse 18 and if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which shall not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when they have trust in him will not hearken unto them then shall his father and his mother laid hold of him and bring him out unto the Elders of the city and unto the Gate of his place the people in the land in their position the ministers have done what they're supposed to do then the Lord said I have to bring this public because when the word is coming forth it's only showing the stage the state the people are in because Verona says if you don't want your sins to be brought up here you better confess it where you are but then when that is coming out from the pulpit then the Lord has dealt with you already in the backyard dealt with you behind it and you did not listen then He had to bring it out how does it work that you know all these things you say it's very easy you say easy if it was easy I would have not asked you the questions like simple if they had repented those sins would have not been called out if the ministry was working the way is supposed to work the Lord would have spoken about something else but as is awakening us is brings us to the understanding Lord surely I've been complacent I've got used to the ministry I just come prepare a sermon quickly let me come and because I have the knowledge and all the songs yeah I know the church really if I want to get the church to this level I'll just go and I find this one two three four five notes let me be on the pulpit but he's saying when the Holy Spirit shall come he the Holy Spirit not you the men because the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord no they didn't look among themselves like who is uh the best friend Among Us who has the most knowledge of no even Judah when he looked his condition he asked even for help himself but then when we become self-sufficient proud of ourselves confident in ourselves yeah I know I can just go out there and do what I'm supposed to do and yeah I'll just you know it's just like a mother in the kitchen she doesn't have to think about what she will cook she knows where all the spices are and she'll just come and put the the the the the pot on the stove and do it quickly and that's it but that's not the same with the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is watching the ministry to lead the people to a certain stage because the people have to be in a certain atmosphere to be able to face the impending disaster so that when the disaster comes just as Jesus was with the disciples he said I prayed that your flight may not be in winter just as Paul would tell Timothy said do quickly come before winter because if you have to travel through winter it's going to be very hard for you many of us will suffered like to travel through winter a lot we don't listen we only wait until the disaster track strikes us then you come Pastor I've done this I've backslide he lied to me but you were not aware of God's plan on how to prevent the impending disaster approach because there was much land yet to be possessed it's not in one day but it is a continuation but then when we get so relaxed and we find like you know we have it we've done it no we haven't when we look behind us yes we've done so much but when we look before us there's still more work to do and as in our Ministries we have not watched the Bible says then shall his father and his mother lay hold and bring him out of the unto the Elders of the city and unto the gates of his place and they shall stay they shall say unto the Elders of the city this our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a gluten and a drunker he watches movies all the time he listens to all this music all the time it does not listen at times why because the environment is in they were given that privilege they were unable to cleanse what will set a good environment for them say before I get back there God's provided a way 1953 paragraph 12 and I tell you parents you put the right kind of a home before your children that's the thing to do because if if I had a Christian home had been reared in perhaps I have been further along with our Lord the Jesus tonight and more people would have been saved the ministry we become so complacent oh I I had to fight a little bit with my first son my first daughter yeah now now I know what to do I'll just talk to them this way but you don't consideration with this new type of us who have access to all the knowledge on the internet what you're going to face you bring a code he brings a code you bring a code she brings a quote then you find yourself like you can't do anything then you become complacent well you just do you I think the Lord will lead you and I've done what I've been I've done best and that's it but William Branham said if you said the right type of environment I know this is a little bit of multi-level Church home personal life and all these things but as I'm laying the pattern so we can each one of us be able to see it in our own lives but my but my people was not a religious family and and God that just had his amazing grace to save me and then since then I have led several of them to the Lord I've baptized my mother I've uh my my father gave his heart to Christ died in my in my homes my grandfather I baptized him in early 90 um early 90 in the river some of my brothers so forth and all along and my boy here and my little girl was over seven my other ones all the entire family were baptized on things he says the Bible go by going back to the Bible and all the men of this obesity shall Stone him with stones put evil away from among you and all Israel shall hear and fear the Lord is showing them what's going on they have to be aware some of the things we keep them Secret cause yeah it's you know we have to do this but that was not so in the time of Peter and them that's where we are going to go back to go back to ananyas and safira that the plot has a family they came in the church did this happen no then the Lord had to call them out they had to be cleaned out yes they had to die I know it's hard yes but they have to die but the Lord who is rich in Mercy gives us more information to understand because many times when you read a scripture like this oh that means I have to become very radical and you know that's not it that's not a word he says that you shall Stone them what is the stone the revelation because when you bring the Revelation to the people you have to know where they at because you have to know what's going on in their lives first to be able to help them out because the minister has to kicks into place the Holy Spirit comes and teaches you all things not a part of it but all things you read the scripture they come to bring you the case Simeon can you help with this case then he tells them look at what's going on I have them in this place can you help them out mother she just nearly uh she just newly wedded can you help her Pastor is a new minister can you help him he's 15 years old can you share with him the experiences because me as a mother the relationship can be tight can you help out the ministry now to show that the condition the person is in will have to come up before you by the help of the Holy Spirit because as the spirit is bringing out to show the condition of the people the people are standing and watching what's going to happen what am I going to do how am I going to deal with this case you see sister you pray for that baby because as a mother you were able to put yourself in that shoe better than me you watch the ministry the Holy Spirit spoke to her go pray for the baby with that which no I am the minister I am the one to pray for her I've received it no the right purp the right people at the right place the right Ministry at the right time that's why they are ministering Spirit to minister to The Heirs of salvation not everything is done on the pulpit but when you are back home when you are there on the streets when you're standing there then you know like uh like Philip that the Holy Spirit does not wait for you to be ready get ready now because when the work comes up you have to be ready to go otherwise you'll be scrambling about brother go up let's say but brother but I need some time first you have to let me know ahead of time no when did pillow fire was moving you have to get ready and go and get moving right away it was not something about okay that said Moses wait a little bit I need to go find the scripture hey Pastor what is that scripture no Daddy I am the situation here I see the boy is talking to me nice I don't know if I have to have to talk to no you have to be ready at that time because once you get influenced by serpent University you gotta all this knowledge you'll find all the excuses to go that path and hear now the Lord is showing the people that when the case of stubbornness comes into play you have you the elders you who I experience have to have the Revelation to Stone them and to kick their evil spirit out and how do you keep that thing that how do you are killed the demons out of the people you watch the land you'll learn the land God has given us each one of us you watch the music you listen to what kind of music is being played in the church for you to know what's going on in with the music you watch the dressing with the sisters as the prophet says you want to know a level of a church look at them the shorter the skirts are going the more immorality you know you will not sit there and say oh that the brother yeah he is very unspiritual but how did you dress that way help your brother out help your sister out be a gentleman brother I'm saying the picture being painted the work being driven by the Holy Spirit at the stage in which you find in yourself married unmarried single anything any type of level that you're in it brings it about to pinpoint places in which you've been we've become complacent to make us move a little bit further to possess our inheritance otherwise we look at the situation we said I don't see anything wrong with this type of dressing but you don't see where that type of dressing is taking the people but you don't see where that type of music is taking the people it becomes more natural to us to watch those movies to listen those music to listen to those sermons because we think that they have something to give to us some some thought like he was just natural to go among the Philistines to go and do whatever he wants and lay with women and come back home the next day he found it very normal because he still had the Revelation because he still had the knowledge to just go pre go read Lord I've seen a go and I pray and I find somebody you are my friend don't tell this to anybody you know I met her we did this and this and that okay shall we pray don't do this again okay I won't do it again you promise I promise by the impending disaster to those behaviors only the Holy Spirit was able to show that to them otherwise it's just a church routine yeah he read that scripture and nobody's gonna preach yeah you've you've it's become common to us I don't see anything really special with that sermon you know oh we've heard Mighty preachers yes you have heard Mighty preachers that Ministry have brought you so far up to here but then the rest of the journey you need not to be aware how to deal with them where to deal with them they listen to the same things they know they know like you know yeah yeah message yeah yeah okay yeah that's it yeah you've preached the prophet no that's not the point the devil has access to the do the knowledge but then the impending disaster because remember at the end of it all is the rapture but then the rupture has to find us in a certain condition and that condition is pictured to us into the the statue of a perfect man but this touch of a perfect man to reach that Paul said I have to Die daily he said to Timothy give thyself unto reading every day verbalam says we cannot insist so much on the importance of Revelation in the believer's life yes we we are knowledge is one thing we deal with Technologies nowadays that the children yesterday don't go don't visit here Rebecca I don't want you to go out there and place that no she's in the bedroom doing the very something that Rebecca had to go out to do how are you able to handle it don't worry if I had a TV in my house I would have shooting it yes that's good but now we don't how many people use TV today it doesn't even require all of them out there they don't even need bottom quotation to do not have the TVs they have all kinds of applications all kinds of channels to be able to access with the very thing that brother was condemning about and when the church the Lord says it he said watch the work of the ministry watch the impending disaster look at what is taking place in the land the Canaanites are in the land but if we are unable to see what's going taking on in the land then what are we sanctification yeah there are people who are Sanctified out there way Sanctified than we are they pay the tithes they give Charities and they call it philanthropic and they do all these great things but that's not the point here what profits a man to gain all this world but to lose its soul yes we look at it yeah it's okay we we have all these big things and we we settle no we're not settle yet here we have no controlling City it may look so nice he may look so calm and so quiet no it's not the devil is roaring like a lion seeking who to devour what good serves us if we have a David with the flock of the father and doesn't see the Wolves and the Bears and all of them that are coming what good to Heaven Soul who sits there who entertains the Philistines in the land they come the mechok and the threads and that if you say one word I'm going to call the police that is shaking oh my God oh my God what good is it watch the ministry watch what went wrong those areas requires not a public show it requires somebody that will go down there and say Lord you have given us the land what tools shall I have to go and fight against the Canaanite what tool shall I have to be able to fight here he will tell you take humility take Simon you forsaken Simon somewhere take back your prayer life before having the financial stability Lord refuse to do this Lord I will just set up the system automatically my Tides plus ten percent above but that's not the point the Lord is showing that though you've come to that stage that's good but now watch the way ahead because the enemy as long as we have not received the change of the body until the anointing upon the Tabernacle comes we still have work to do the reason the Lord has set us in that position is to cry out unto him every day look in the land this easier request here left here this one is not going on that one is not going on but then the Lord says Judah you need to be able to help your ministry should be able to help to what extent does your ministry help um I just like go to church I I don't like to do anything my job is to go pray walk out that's it but the Lord says you have to do it and for you to do it the Holy Spirit should come there not in their historical the holy spirit is like Yahweh you know brother you know we've received a prophet that's one thing like the sons of Shiva we pull we preach Paul we preach this is yeah that's good Paul we know Branham we know Martin will know all of them we know but who are you because the demon in that system she was crawling like a serpent and said William Branham what did it do I have to do with you they knew who William Branham was do they know who you are because when Samson was powerless then they started making the fun of him oh you came here you were very tight I had let's go take a drink just just a little bit I don't drink too much just a little bit then you become the more drunker than them the Bible said the sun was what first stubborn then what Glutton then what drunkard one stage leading unto another but then the Awakening of the spirit is to show the people awake watch trim your lamp fill it with oil why because it's dark heavy nothing reserved we're not talking about the backside of uh of the children right we're talking about people in the land what they have to do and what do we compare that to against the pattern against Pentacles what they were supposed to come back to where are we where are we at it's not a collective thing yeah we had this church no but the Lord is watching in those areas that the ministry should get into place should get into work a little bit of bitterness taking place a little bit of suspicious spirit yeah I'll greet him as a brother you know we stopped there the spirit is going into those places to awaken us but when you hear my voice Harden not your heart it's very gentle and when verbalam says he that he loves it Justin's and rebukes he says exposition of church ages and now the audition to church and now he says to his own as many as I love I rebuke and Justin to rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with a view to correction trusting does not mean to punish it means to discipline because the subject amendment is in mind he wants you to readjust from the condition that you're in we're not talking about you backsliding but we're talking about you amending your ways for you to progress into the work you're not in Egypt you're not in the wilderness you're not on this side Jordan you already in the land but now the Lord has said watching this place here is exposing this thing so we become aware of it so we can cry out more into the spirit and know on how to advance this is exactly what what we find in Hebrews 12 5 11 and we have forgotten the exhortation which is packeth unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chestning of the Lord no offense when a doubt are rebuked of him for whom the Lord will loveth he trustens encourages every son whom he receiveth if he enjoys chastening God dealing with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father just not but if ye be without trusting without your chastisement wherefore wait for all our particles then you are bastard not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we and we give them reverence shall shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they very very for a few days a trust in us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet for we might be part circus of his Holiness na would now not just think for the presence similar to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it will have the peaceful fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby it may seem like every time I go to church his horse always hard on us why can't I just have a little bit of extension yeah it's hard though it's not it's not joyful now why should I Monday to Sunday always have long said yes it is hard but if you harden your heart if your heart can receive that then you're a bastard then when you cross the line then the Lord starts watching you yeah you I think I can dress this yeah you can even have a dream yeah you see yourself like you know with a nice skirt just a just a little bit behind the knee yeah you have pictures right of the prophet's wife you have it you have it good reasons for you to do what you can do but the spirit says watch the vision on to what are you comparing to what is the Plumb line what are you embracing it's hard it's not joyful but to those that will embrace it when the product of it the fruit of it shall come then you look behind and say oh really yeah really I didn't think that all these years yes that's the result of it William Branham labored so much in the field you look at Aura Robert and Billy Graham and you see all the big buildings and all he said Lord can't you trust me with all this some of you do say to something Lord if you trust me I can have that skirt that left nothing will happen the Lord said put a longer one it's hard for the time present even the voice told him I am your project but that was not enough but until one morning do you want to see obviously under he steps out it's real for me to get here requires this path yes sir it's so division the bride walking there was a vision but until he stepped in there then he saw the sister coming dressed like in the vision different stages of the ministry you start like you know first pull obedience the second pull you do this third pool they reject you and all this yeah you have to go through that for this reception here Paul himself Jews of them at the Pharisees lose but then when he refined himself like you know all this is done until to the Corinthians he said I saw a man who step up there and so things that unlawful to speak to men it has been given to you the knowledge the understanding all these things so that at the end of The Journey you shall not say I did not know because those tapes and those messages will come out ring in your mind you had the opportunity look at how many people you've influenced oh brother I never slept with any other man but only my husband brother Branham says yes but by the way you dressed look how many people you've sent into hell the work of the ministry was it to send people into heaven or to send them into hell because the work that we do reflects who are we partaking of because the first guy in the heavens he did his ministry to bring Spirits down here and what are we doing directly and directly in our bedroom in our mind in everything else you see it's very hard to preach this kind of sermons it's hard when you get exposed they said Lord say go this way how how am I going to do it but you have to bring it out they have to come back in line they have to watch those places and yet it will take you a while of course for you to understand it but when the Holy Spirit comes and it starts showing you the impact of those things that you're wearing in the secrets and those things and those behaviors and things then you start being awakened we are surrounded by all these kind of demons I've been bringing all these demons in the church have been like you know all these weaker ones I did not pay attention to them I leave all type of lives out there and I come here and I see there's a signs and those spirits will be moving around and affecting these young ones and the weak ones only the spirit will be able to unveil those things because let's not be selfish let's be aware let be conscious and to be cautious through the holy spirit this holy spirit that unveils these things because even William Branham preached they say like you know the first cell is this but then when the Holy Spirit came you start opening a level that he did not see before the things that we may see they may be right to our own eyes the word said lean not to your own understanding shall we pray Heavenly Father surely lord it's uh hard unto amend to rebuke and to speak father but Lord you've shown us the Lord that to rebuke is not to punish but Lord an amendment is in view father to align us once again with our theophanese Almighty savior we're standing humbly before you Lord we do not know if tomorrow is ours this could be the last sermon William Bradham preached communion and that was it father we're standing here we don't know what will be the next few minutes it may be my last sermon you I did not see myself okay but father God your sons your daughters they seated here father not to hear men or how a man can preach father many father sermons have been preached much better way clearer way simpler way deep and things father but the point of the word Lord by the foolishness of the preaching shall I save these people Lord we are weak father a confess it Lord made but we know there's a stronger one that is you father you've promised all that you and you shall come you shall teach us and lead us in all truth may you give us your father God this truth may we feed upon may we be transformed in our position where Buffalo the father God we are weak father home to make love father God a cleansing in every places look for the God we are tight about Lord oh Lord God we are just your children we are weak we don't know what love father God is out there but you see everything follow the prophet's message for deliverance father the angel of the Lord after William Branham meetings was going look for the god in the neighborhoods to fulfill the scriptures father if there be any places if there be anything father that we are to be awakened unto may you do it father give us more Revelation fun because Lord when the work shall call again we may be ready no no father God just re comparing scripture to scriptures and knowledge law firaga showing off Lord how deep we can be father but Lord Almighty God you yourself in the ministry to The Heirs of salvation our local father got away unto you bless your father God your children as
