[9:01] Several prayer requests here this
[9:03] morning. Brother Jesse love all if you

[9:07] take us to the Lord in prayer.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Case Terren is going for surgery
[9:14] tomorrow. So we want to remember Case in
[9:15] prayer. Pray the Lord would just be with
[9:17] him in a special way and
[9:20] brother Freddy Canana is in in need of a
[9:22] special touch in his body. He's going
[9:24] through some issues. So pray the Lord be
[9:26] with brother Freddy and meet his need.
[9:30] We have a request this morning for
[9:31] Sister Miriam She's been told she
[9:34] has possible mastitis and is in a lot of
[9:37] pain. She coverets our prayers. May the
[9:39] hand of the gentle shepherd touch her
[9:42] body and be with her. So let's remember
[9:44] sister Mary Cox this morning.
[9:48] Sister Gracia Castor has turned in a
[9:51] request for Ivonne Rodriguez in Durang
[9:54] Durango. says she's going through
[9:56] dialysis and the doctors have told her
[9:58] she only has 30% of her kidneys that are
[10:01] working
[10:03] just having faith that the Lord will
[10:05] come on the ceiling heal her. Amen. So
[10:08] that's for memory bond Rodriguez there
[10:10] in Durango. We also have another request
[10:13] for someone with some kidney issues.
[10:14] Sister Molly has turned in a request
[10:16] says I have a friend who had a kidney
[10:19] transplant about 12 years ago. it is now
[10:22] only functioning at 13%
[10:25] and they were getting ready to start
[10:26] dialysis and she was told her best
[10:28] chance was a live donor and so she's
[10:31] asked for prayer and so the Lord could
[10:33] come on the scene for this friend of
[10:35] Sister Mollies pray the Lord would just
[10:36] meet each and everyone Jesse comes and
[10:39] takes us to the Lord in prayer if you
[10:40] have a need this morning just want to
[10:42] lift it before the Lord he's the healer
[10:44] of the broken pieces and he's a mener of
[10:46] every broken heart Jesse if you would
[10:49] Amen.
[10:50] [Music]
[10:59] &gt;&gt; As we come before him,
[11:02] we was singing earlier about Lord, we
[11:05] want to see you.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; Well, where is he?
[11:10] &gt;&gt; He's right here. Look around.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; He's right here.
[11:14] You know, we
[11:16] &gt;&gt; we look at the flesh and that's not
[11:18] that's not him. He's in us.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; He's causing this flesh to overcome this
[11:24] stuff.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; This is this is nothing. You know, we we
[11:27] look at we look at death as, oh, it's a
[11:30] horrible thing. It's not a horrible
[11:31] thing.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; It takes us to where we've been living
[11:34] all our lives to go.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; We should never have fear
[11:39] &gt;&gt; for death.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; Because why? Cuz he's in us. Hallelujah.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; So these ones that asked for prayer,
[11:47] it's just like Jesus whenever he as
[11:49] whenever he was God and yet he still
[11:52] prayed, right? So that's what we got to
[11:55] do. We pray for these
[11:57] &gt;&gt; these are even people we don't know that
[11:59] you know maybe but somebody here knows
[12:01] him that they're asking for prayer.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; So as as God, what do we do?
[12:09] &gt;&gt; We pray. Let's let's pray. Dear Lord
[12:12] Jesus, Father, we come to you, Father.
[12:15] Lord, we love you, Lord. Lord, when we
[12:18] look at the flesh, we see the
[12:19] weaknesses, Lord. And but that's not
[12:22] what you want us to look at. You told us
[12:25] to sacrifice,
[12:28] this flesh. And a sacrifice is something
[12:31] that takes a lot of pain and agony and
[12:34] it hurts. And Lord, we have loved ones
[12:37] that are hurting, Father.
[12:40] But Lord, we sacrifice this flesh. We
[12:44] look to you, Lord. We look to you for
[12:46] your promises. We believe what you say.
[12:49] Lord, it's your word, not our word.
[12:52] &gt;&gt; Father, we just ask that you these
[12:54] prayer requests that you answer each one
[12:57] according to your will. Father,
[13:00] &gt;&gt; we love you, Lord. And we just thank you
[13:02] for being with us, Lord, as we we're
[13:04] here to celebrate you, Lord. And we just
[13:08] ask you to be with us today, Lord. Guide
[13:10] us and keep us, Lord.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; Speak to our hearts, Lord Jesus. Speak
[13:15] to the hearts of the ones that are ill
[13:16] and having hard times during the
[13:19] sacrificial time. Lord, we love you,
[13:21] Lord, in Jesus name. Amen.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother.
[13:27] Amen. You may be seated this morning.
[13:29] Want to welcome each one in the house of
[13:31] the Lord here. If you're here visiting
[13:32] this morning, we welcome you and looking

[19:55] opposition strong for the bride there's
[19:58] a way provided
[20:02] if I plan to go through just to hope

[32:52] In the name
[32:54] I call it time of trouble.
[32:59] There is a song
[33:02] that comes in the night.
[33:07] There is a voice
[33:10] that comes a stor that
[33:16] it's Jesus.
[33:20] Jesus
[33:24] who
[33:28] speak to the sea

[33:59] [Music]
[34:03] My savior.
[34:07] There is power
[34:10] in
[34:12] your name.
[34:15] You're my rock,
[34:19] my redeemer.
[34:23] There is power
[34:26] in your name.
[34:30] In your name.
[34:36] Who walks on the water
[34:39] to see to see
[34:43] who stands in the fire
[34:47] beside me.
[34:51] He roars like a lion.
[34:55] He bled as a lamb.
[34:59] He carries
[35:01] my healing in his hands.
[35:07] He is Jesus.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's pray together.
[35:13] Father God,
[35:15] &gt;&gt; we approach thee now in the
[35:18] most holy, wonderful name of Jesus
[35:20] Christ. the one who walked in the water,
[35:23] calms the seas, speaks to the storms,
[35:27] and you're still the same today as you
[35:29] was then, Lord. And so, Father, I pray
[35:31] this morning that you would come by and
[35:35] Lord, that you would calm the seas in
[35:37] our lives.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, that you would speak to the
[35:39] storms, that you would speak to the
[35:41] wind, and Father, that you would let
[35:43] faith arise in our lives that we might
[35:45] walk on the water with you, Lord.
[35:48] Father, we love you. We commit all
[35:49] things into your hands now. I give this
[35:52] service over to you, Lord, for thy
[35:54] kingdom's glory. Let thy will be done in
[35:57] Jesus Christ's name.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. God bless you. You may
[36:01] be seated just for a few minutes. Thank
[36:04] you musicians. You can just wait there
[36:07] while I greet the people here. And I
[36:10] feel like I need to reintroduce myself.
[36:13] And uh it's certainly good to be home
[36:16] and back with my family and back with my
[36:20] church family. And uh you don't realize
[36:23] how much you miss people until you're
[36:25] gone. And um so yeah, brother Johnny
[36:28] understands, huh, Brother Johnny? And um
[36:31] so anyway, just to give a a little
[36:33] update, um I was talking to brother
[36:35] Pierre in the back there and he thought,
[36:37] "Well, I thought you were in Ireland and
[36:40] I thought you were here." and I was
[36:41] like, "No, no, that's all wrong." So, I
[36:43] figured I might as well just share with
[36:45] you all uh where I've been and what's
[36:47] been going on. So, I was in Australia
[36:50] there at the beginning of the month with
[36:52] brother Daniel White um in Brisbane and
[36:56] uh I was one of two speakers at his
[36:59] youth camp there and we had such a
[37:01] really nice time and um it was a real
[37:04] blessing. you know, the the the
[37:07] people, man, it they were almost like
[37:10] laughing too much with me, you know, and
[37:12] um but I just had a real good time with
[37:15] them and we had some wonderful
[37:17] testimonies of of what God had done. And
[37:21] what was amazing to me was not one time
[37:24] did I ever uh mention about prayer lines
[37:27] or uh mention about uh the laying on of
[37:30] hands or any of those things. And not
[37:32] one time did I hit against it. Okay. And
[37:36] so after the services were complete and
[37:39] everything, um they had a testimony
[37:42] service and there was there was quite a
[37:45] few of the young people. They said, you
[37:47] know, uh I always thought that I had to
[37:50] go through a prayer line or I had to
[37:53] have somebody lay hands on me or I had
[37:55] to come to an altar in order for for God
[37:58] to meet my need through the minister.
[38:01] And their testimony was this, that I
[38:04] found out that God can meet my need
[38:07] right where I'm sitting.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; And that God can answer questions in my
[38:12] heart right where I'm sitting by the
[38:15] ministering of the word.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; And and it just encouraged me so much.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Um because you know they were saying
[38:23] this is a different kind of a camp.
[38:25] Well,
[38:27] the humanity and man, which is myself,
[38:30] thinks, well, different in a good way or
[38:32] a bad way, you see, and that's kind of
[38:35] the the battle that we that we fight
[38:37] with as ministers. But I guess it was a
[38:39] good way. And I have some pictures here
[38:42] uh that I would like to share. Uh
[38:45] starting from the left, that's sister
[38:47] Cheryl. That's brother Daniel's uh wife,
[38:50] brother Daniel in the white there. Uh he
[38:52] was the host pastor. In the middle is
[38:54] brother uh Ben Gloin um from New
[38:58] Zealand. And on the right that's me
[39:00] obviously. I never realize how short I
[39:02] am until I see pictures of myself. Like
[39:05] there's no way I'm that short, but
[39:07] there's a way.
[39:10] The picture does not lie. Okay, it's up
[39:12] here. Praise the Lord. So, here we are
[39:14] again. Uh he took us uh on a little
[39:16] drive and um you know, it's amazing. In
[39:18] Ireland, uh car sickness wasn't a thing
[39:20] for me. And you know, Australia is very
[39:24] similar to Ireland is low rolling hills
[39:26] and lots of curves and the road and
[39:28] everything. And I realized getting, you
[39:30] know, here in Arizona, the roads are all
[39:33] straight. And so it was just a real
[39:36] battle for me not to get car sick. And
[39:39] um but go back to that other picture.
[39:40] Sorry. Um the brother on the right
[39:44] there, his name is Brother Paul. And
[39:46] brother Paul was from Western Australia,
[39:48] came and he's moved to Brother Daniel's
[39:50] church. And so I left here on the
[39:53] Monday. I got there on Wednesday morning
[39:55] and then I preached Wednesday night at
[39:56] the church. So after I got done
[39:58] ministering, I got to greet the people
[40:00] and this brother was right on the front
[40:02] row and and he's a real character. And
[40:05] um so I shook his hand and and I said,
[40:08] "Hi, brother. What's your name?" And he
[40:10] goes, "Oh, my name is Paul."
[40:14] Huh? You know, I'm true American. Huh?
[40:18] He goes, "Po?"
[40:20] I said, 'I'm sorry, brother. I I I
[40:23] didn't catch your name. Can you say it
[40:25] one more? Paul. I said, 'Oh, Paul. He
[40:28] goes, "Yeah, Paul."
[40:32] So, you come to find out in certain uh
[40:35] sides of Australia, they have different
[40:37] accents just like here. And um Western
[40:40] Australia, they take the full word, they
[40:41] cut it in half, and that's what they
[40:43] say. So, they speak half sentences. And
[40:46] um so I needed an interpreter for a
[40:48] little bit at the beginning, but we we
[40:50] got through it and I f I found out that
[40:52] brother Paul is a fine fine man. Fine
[40:55] man. Uh let's go to the next one,
[40:57] please.
[40:58] This was this just blew my mind. Can you
[41:01] guys see that?
[41:03] Kangaroos,
[41:04] people's yards like rabbits. I thought,
[41:08] my goodness, look at that thing. Huh?
[41:11] Isn't that just the oddest thing you
[41:13] ever saw in the front yard? It's just it
[41:18] just abs it still blows my mind. I got a
[41:21] video of one of these things standing up
[41:24] and they got these really long feet but
[41:26] they look like a big muscular man and uh
[41:29] and you know people talk about fighting
[41:31] a kangaroo. It's all nonsense. You don't
[41:33] want to fight those things. So I thought
[41:36] you guys would like that. Let's go to
[41:38] the next one please.
[41:43] if we have any. Oh, yeah. Here we go.
[41:45] So, that was the camp. There was about
[41:46] uh I think there was 65 young people
[41:49] there and then they had, you know, the
[41:51] counselors and everything like that. And
[41:53] they actually they make all their own
[41:55] food at the camp. Um and they're a
[41:57] smaller camp so they can do that. But in
[42:00] saying that, it's a ton of work. And um
[42:03] and so they actually had a banquet one
[42:05] of the nights, which was really, really
[42:07] nice. We should do it at our camp
[42:09] sometime. Um, and this was this is in
[42:13] Canada, but going back. So, anyways,
[42:15] there was uh I love lamb. Lamb is like
[42:19] one of my favorite things. And we don't
[42:21] really eat it here much in America. Over
[42:23] there, they got that's all they eat. And
[42:26] so, they had lamb for the banquet. So,
[42:28] Sister Cheryl told the sisters there,
[42:30] you know, hey, Brother Steven really
[42:32] likes lamb. Okay. So after I preach the
[42:34] banquet, you know, it's like 11:30 or
[42:37] whatever, and they set this massive
[42:40] plate of lamb right in front of me, and
[42:43] I'm all, "Thank you so much." Like, it
[42:46] was late. That was a heavy meal, but I
[42:48] ate every bit of it cuz that's what
[42:50] that's what you do when you go
[42:51] traveling. You eat what's before you.
[42:53] Okay. Um, so then I came home and what
[42:57] was awesome, which was really nice, this
[42:59] is a real blessing of the Lord. when I
[43:01] was flying there. Uh, where did I fly to
[43:04] Ashlin? First first flight, I can't
[43:07] remember. San Francisco. So, I fly to
[43:10] San Francisco and all all of a sudden I
[43:12] hear my name over the intercom. Steve
[43:14] McNeely, please come to the front desk.
[43:16] I'm Oh, great. What's going on? You
[43:19] know, I always think the worst. She
[43:20] said, "This is your lucky day, pal. You
[43:22] got upgraded to premium." Like, let's
[43:24] go.
[43:26] So uh so I went from you know a small
[43:30] seat to a big seat with lots of leg
[43:33] room. It thing recines and there was
[43:35] nobody sitting beside me and I slept I
[43:38] think it's a 12-h hour flight. I slept
[43:39] for like on and off for 8 hours. So when
[43:42] I got over there I was golden. It was
[43:44] really good.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. It was a real blessing. So
[43:49] then I came home. I was here for a week
[43:50] and then we went to Canada to preach for
[43:52] brother Eugene Braun. And then if we
[43:54] could just put that last picture up
[43:56] there, please. Uh we had a little youth
[43:58] meeting there um outside and it was just
[44:01] just real real real nice. Um they were
[44:05] real um responsive to the to the youth
[44:08] service and and it being an open
[44:11] discussion rather than being preaching.
[44:13] So I just kind of walked around the
[44:15] campfire and we spoke a little bit there
[44:17] and they were they were really really
[44:19] encouraged. So, that's where I've been
[44:21] and here I am uh back in the house of
[44:24] the Lord, back at my post of duty and um
[44:27] I'm just happy to be home. So, God bless
[44:29] you. Let's just uh let's just turn to
[44:32] our Bibles. I'm sorry, musicians. Thank
[44:34] you. I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
[44:36] Let's stand together. Turn with me to
[44:38] the book of Judges, chapter 6, and we'll
[44:41] read verses 1-2.
[44:50] I'm not too sure
[44:52] exactly where I'm going this morning. Uh
[44:56] but if you pull, I'll preach and I'll
[44:59] try my best to yield and um and we'll
[45:03] see what what direction the Lord leads
[45:05] us in.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Judges 6 uh verse one. And the children
[45:10] of Israel did evil in the sight of the
[45:12] Lord, and the Lord delivered them into
[45:14] the hand of Midian 7 years. And the hand
[45:17] of Midian prevailed against Israel. And
[45:20] because of the Midianites, the children
[45:21] of Israel made them the dens which are
[45:24] in the mountains and caves and
[45:26] strongholds. And so it was when Israel
[45:29] had sown that the Midianites came up and
[45:31] the Amalachites and the children of the
[45:34] east even they came up against them and
[45:37] they encamped against them and destroyed
[45:39] the increase of the earth till thou come
[45:42] onto Gaza and left no sustenance for
[45:46] Israel, neither sheep nor ox ass. For
[45:50] they came up with their cattle and their
[45:52] tents, and they came as grasshoppers for
[45:54] multitude. For both they and their
[45:56] camels were without number, and they
[45:58] entered into the land to destroy it.
[46:01] Notice they weren't going in to fight
[46:02] with the Israelites or to kill them or
[46:05] with or to slay them with the sword, but
[46:07] they were taking away their inheritance.
[46:10] They were trying to take away what God
[46:12] had gave to them. And by doing so, they
[46:15] were just taking over the land to
[46:18] destroy them. And that's exactly what
[46:20] Satan wants to do with us. He He wants
[46:22] to come and take over our lives, take
[46:24] over our mind because he wants to take
[46:26] away our inheritance.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; And Israel was greatly impoverished
[46:34] because of the Midianites. And the
[46:36] children of Israel cried unto the Lord.
[46:38] And it came to pass when the children of
[46:40] Israel cried unto the Lord, because of
[46:42] the Midianites, that the Lord sent a
[46:44] prophet unto the children of Israel,
[46:47] which said unto them, Thus saith the
[46:49] Lord God of Israel, I brought you up
[46:51] from Egypt, and brought you forth out of
[46:53] the house of bondage. I delivered you
[46:55] out of the hand of the Egyptians, and
[46:57] out of the hand of all that oppressed
[46:59] you, and drove them out from before you,
[47:01] and gave you their land. And I said unto
[47:04] you, I am the Lord your God. Fear not
[47:06] the gods of the Amorites, Amorites, and
[47:09] in the in whose land you dwell. But ye
[47:12] have not obeyed my voice.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; And there came an angel of the Lord, and
[47:17] sat under an oak, which was an O of that
[47:20] pertained unto Joash the Aiserite, and
[47:24] his son Gideon threshed wheat by the
[47:26] wine press to hide it from the
[47:27] Midianites. And the angel of the Lord
[47:29] appeared unto him, and said unto him,
[47:31] The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man
[47:34] of valor. Amen. And you may take your
[47:36] seat this morning.
[47:43] In chapter 7 verse 18
[47:51] it says uh and this is Gideon speaking
[47:55] when I blow with a trumpet I and all
[47:59] that are with me then blow ye the
[48:02] trumpets also on every side of all the
[48:05] camp and say the sword of the Lord and
[48:09] of Gideon.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:12] Amen. So I would like to title my
[48:15] thought here this morning, the sword of
[48:18] the Lord and of Gideon. I it's very
[48:22] important and I and I and I want to the
[48:25] Lord willing expound a little bit about
[48:28] that because uh Gideon came to a place
[48:31] in his life to where it just wasn't the
[48:33] sword of the Lord.
[48:36] He came to a place where of of of
[48:39] uh a a place of position and a place of
[48:43] confidence in the in himself and not
[48:46] just in the Lord that he said uh this is
[48:50] the sword of the Lord
[48:52] and of Gideon. And so where I want to
[48:57] perhaps go this morning is that I I want
[49:01] us all to realize that we have the sword
[49:05] of the Lord,
[49:06] &gt;&gt; but we don't just want to leave it as
[49:09] the sword of the Lord, but we want it to
[49:11] be the sword of the Lord and
[49:14] &gt;&gt; put your name there.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Don't just leave it the sword of the
[49:17] Lord and and and and a two-edged sword
[49:20] or the sword of of the Lord and Brham.
[49:23] But I want you now to take your name and
[49:27] put it in that place because now it'll
[49:30] give you a place of position and
[49:33] authority alongside the word of God.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; So that's where I want to go to. I don't
[49:41] exactly know how I'm going to get there,
[49:43] but we're going to get there
[49:44] &gt;&gt; by the help of the Lord. Amen.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; So, we just read in our opening
[49:48] scripture how that um Gideon was
[49:52] threshing wheat by the wine press. And
[49:55] for those of you that, you know, it's
[49:57] very easy just to skip over this portion
[50:00] of scripture and and say, "Yeah, he was
[50:02] threshing wheat at the wine press."
[50:04] Well, you're not supposed to thresh
[50:06] wheat at the wine press. You're supposed
[50:09] to press wine at the wine press. you're
[50:12] supposed to thresh wheat at the
[50:14] threshing floor. And so the re his
[50:17] reasoning for doing this was because um
[50:21] Gideon was living his life as an
[50:24] Israelite, as a Jew in a in a in a in a
[50:28] way of fear. And so he was fearful of
[50:31] the Amalachites. He was fearful of the
[50:34] Midianites and and and all the countries
[50:36] of the East because they were as
[50:38] grasshoppers. They they they were they
[50:40] were as grasshoppers in multitude. And
[50:43] here he was, he was a let's call him a
[50:45] son of God. That it can make it a little
[50:48] more relatable for you and I. Here he
[50:51] was as a son of God and he's trying to
[50:53] feed his family and he's and he's living
[50:55] in the promised land and and and and
[50:58] he's harvesting his his wheat. And the
[51:01] reason that he's harvesting his wheat is
[51:04] because he was a man of diligence. He
[51:07] was, "You can't harvest wheat without
[51:09] first planting wheat.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; You can't plant wheat before you till
[51:14] the ground and you put in the work and
[51:16] and and then the rest of it, you kind of
[51:18] you have to leave it up to God." People
[51:20] say, "We'll leave it up to mother
[51:22] nature. We'll we'll do our thing. We'll
[51:24] leave it up to mother nature." That's
[51:26] not what it is. We'll leave it up to God
[51:28] to bring the increase.
[51:31] So the reason that he was able to uh
[51:34] harvest his wheat is because he was a
[51:36] man of diligence. And so for us as sons
[51:40] and daughters of God, we need to make
[51:42] sure that we are diligent in our life
[51:45] with Christ. And what does it mean to be
[51:47] to be diligent? What does it mean to be
[51:50] diligent as a Christian? Well, it means
[51:52] that we first must uh plant the right
[51:55] kind of crop. We must first plant the
[51:58] right kind of seed because whatever seed
[52:00] that we plant, that is the seed that's
[52:02] going to bring forth. That's the kind of
[52:05] plant and the kind of fruit that our
[52:07] lives are going to materialize. Why?
[52:10] Because it's a law of God that whatever
[52:12] seed goes into the ground, that seed is
[52:15] going to produce itself uh uh at a time
[52:19] of harvest. And so it is with our lives.
[52:22] It's it's it's so um it's kind of uh
[52:26] interesting how that we expect to to
[52:30] have uh a spiritual life with Christ and
[52:33] we expect to have an overcoming life
[52:36] with God and a closer walk with the
[52:37] Lord, but instead of sowing to the to
[52:40] the spiritual, we sow more to the
[52:42] natural man. Instead of sowing to the
[52:45] supernatural, we sow to the carnal. And
[52:48] we sow to the carnal expecting spiritual
[52:51] results. And that just isn't going to
[52:53] happen. Whenever we sow to the carnal
[52:55] man, we're going to reap carnal results.
[52:58] And so my question to you this morning
[53:01] and to myself as I as I preach and
[53:03] minister these things, what kind of seed
[53:06] are we planting in the grounds of my
[53:08] heart? Cuz understand on a Wednesday and
[53:11] Sunday is just not good enough. All
[53:13] right.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Well, I go to church on a Wednesday and
[53:17] I go to church on a Sunday and I'm there
[53:19] and I'm faithful and that's great and we
[53:22] love that. But what about Monday and
[53:24] Tuesday?
[53:25] &gt;&gt; What about Thursday, Friday and
[53:27] Saturday? What about the rest of the
[53:29] days of the week, the rest of the time
[53:31] on a Sunday or on a Wednesday? What kind
[53:33] of seed are we sewing in our lives?
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. because whatever kind of seed we
[53:39] sew in our heart, it's going to produce
[53:42] something.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; And so, it's really interesting when you
[53:46] begin to think about the law of of
[53:49] sewing and reaping. Um, you know, it it
[53:52] it it even not only does it uh affect us
[53:55] as individuals, but you know, a lot of
[53:58] times as as families, we expect the most
[54:01] out of our kids.
[54:04] We expect the most out of our family.
[54:06] We're we're believers in the word and we
[54:08] go to church and and we take it
[54:10] seriously and and and we expect our
[54:12] children to to to walk the line and to
[54:15] have a standard and so on and so forth.
[54:18] But so much of the time as parents here
[54:20] is where we fail. We expect something
[54:23] out of our family. We expect something
[54:26] out of our children, out of our husband,
[54:27] out of our wife, whatever it is. But we
[54:30] never give the way to get to that spot.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we expect everything up here.
[54:38] But yet you see let's let's let's put it
[54:41] like this. So God has an expectation for
[54:45] you and I.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; He has an expectation for us to come to
[54:49] a place of repentance in our lives.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; He has an expectation for us and how we
[54:55] live our lives. He has an expectation
[54:57] for us to receive the Holy Ghost. And
[55:01] not only does he have the expectation,
[55:03] but he provides a way in order for us to
[55:07] come up to that standard and to live up
[55:10] to that expectation.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; But as parents, what we fail to do is we
[55:16] we expect you to walk a certain line or
[55:19] a certain road and we expect you to come
[55:21] up in a certain way, but we don't give
[55:24] the way and how to do it.
[55:26] And so our expectations
[55:29] of our children is actually, let me say
[55:33] it like this. This is what you, brother
[55:34] Eugene Braun, would say, it's evil.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; And the reason that it's evil is because
[55:42] we're expecting something, but we're not
[55:44] providing the way in order for the
[55:47] fruits to fruition. Right.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; We expect something in our family's
[55:52] lives, but we're not planting the seed
[55:55] in their heart that's going to bring
[55:57] forth what we're expecting. So, a lot of
[56:00] times we're expecting uh X, Y, and Z.
[56:04] But really, we're planting A, B, and C.
[56:08] And so, we're planting A, B, and C in
[56:11] our own hearts, in our wife's life, in
[56:13] our children's life, in our church
[56:16] family life. and we're planting ABC, but
[56:20] we're expecting to get X, Y, and Z. And
[56:23] then we get frustrated when we don't get
[56:25] ABC,
[56:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying?
[56:29] &gt;&gt; And so I believe, and I've been really
[56:32] I'm just preaching from my heart. I've
[56:35] been really taking a uh an inward
[56:38] inventory of myself
[56:42] &gt;&gt; and and realizing, you know, uh where
[56:45] I'm at in life and realizing where my
[56:48] family is at and my children and and and
[56:51] realizing the responsibility now that I
[56:55] just can't expect them to get to a
[56:58] certain place if I don't provide the way
[57:01] for them to get there. And if I don't
[57:04] provide the way for them to get what I'm
[57:06] expecting out of them, it's not their
[57:09] fault.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; It's my fault.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; And I'm really looking in inwardly like
[57:17] it's it's pretty heavy.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; And maybe it's just God taking me to a
[57:23] higher standard. It's it's just God
[57:25] bringing me up another level or I I
[57:28] don't know what it is.
[57:30] Even this sermon this morning, I I I was
[57:34] up to 1:00 last night and I'm thinking,
[57:36] man, where am I? And I there's just no
[57:39] inspiration. There's just absolutely no
[57:41] anointing. I have a little direction and
[57:44] that's it. And I'm like, Lord, what's
[57:46] going on?
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Here I am before the people and and
[57:50] there's an expectation in their hearts
[57:52] that they want to hear from you and not
[57:54] from me. And and here I am and I don't
[57:56] have anything.
[57:59] And so perhaps it's God just taking me
[58:02] away from the comfort of of of a
[58:05] structured sermon.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Because who says that a sermon has to be
[58:11] structured in a certain way.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; That's perhaps just me.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; That's perhaps what I expect a sermon to
[58:18] be. But perhaps God is is just taking me
[58:21] out another channel. And he's saying,
[58:22] "Stephen, there's more ways than one way
[58:25] to skin a cat.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Just because you think it has to be
[58:29] structured, it doesn't mean it has to be
[58:31] structured and how you want it to be.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; So you got to walk by faith."
[58:37] &gt;&gt; And so God, he doesn't expect you to
[58:40] have everything all figured out.
[58:42] Actually, he wants you not to have it
[58:44] all figured out because his ways are
[58:46] above our ways. and the ways that he
[58:48] takes us is different than our carnal
[58:50] man. But so much of the time we struggle
[58:53] with our will and with God's will.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; But God wants you to surrender your
[58:58] life. He wants you to surrender your way
[59:01] of walking, your way of living, your way
[59:03] of raising your family and say, "Son,
[59:06] this is how I want you to do it." And in
[59:08] order to do that, you've got to walk by
[59:10] faith.
[59:12] [Music]
[59:14] Because God doesn't show us everything
[59:16] right away,
[59:19] &gt;&gt; but it's one step at a time.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Where are you going, Abraham? I don't
[59:23] know.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; But I'm walking and I'm walking by faith
[59:27] and I've heard a voice and he told me to
[59:30] separate from my family and I've
[59:32] separated from Lot and I have all these.
[59:34] I have this covenant that I don't
[59:36] deserve. this covenant that God has
[59:39] given to me that I haven't done nothing
[59:41] to deserve. But it's but it's his
[59:43] election. It's his sovereign grace that
[59:46] he's reaching out to me. Where are you
[59:48] going? I don't know.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; How are you going to get there? I'm
[59:51] going to walk
[59:52] &gt;&gt; unless he takes me home.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; And so that's how it is with you and I.
[59:57] We get so structured. We get we put God
[1:00:00] in this tiny little box
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; and we say, "Lord, whenever you've met
[1:00:04] my requirements and when the time is
[1:00:06] right, I'm going to open this little box
[1:00:09] because I think that this is how you
[1:00:11] want to do it."
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; We ought to take God out of the box.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Because when you have God in a little
[1:00:16] box, you're you're you're you're binding
[1:00:19] him.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; You're binding him. Brother Brandham
[1:00:22] said that through denominational creeds
[1:00:24] and dogmas, the Holy Spirit was bound
[1:00:26] for 2,000 years. How many knows the
[1:00:28] quote? Well, now in the message, we bang
[1:00:31] God with our own lives, thinking, "Well,
[1:00:33] this is how I want to do it and the way
[1:00:35] that I want to go and this and this and
[1:00:37] this." And we put God in this little
[1:00:39] box. And what we do to God is we bind
[1:00:41] him working in our lives.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; We ought to let God free once in a while
[1:00:46] and say, "Lord, you know what I'm going
[1:00:48] to do with my paycheck this week? I'm
[1:00:50] going to give it away and I'm going to
[1:00:51] do this and I'm going to walk by
[1:00:53] complete faith."
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Very good. Amen.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Because it's opposite to our carnal man.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; That's walking by faith.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Steve,
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; I don't have to have it all figured
[1:01:15] out." Mm-
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; I don't have to have every every every
[1:01:20] inch of my life planned out of how I'm
[1:01:22] going to get there. No,
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; it's good to plan.
[1:01:26] But let me say, let me put it like this.
[1:01:29] It's good to plan ahead cuz cuz if you
[1:01:32] plan to fail, you might as well if you
[1:01:34] fail to plan, you might as well plan to
[1:01:36] fail.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; But let me put it like this. Be flexible
[1:01:40] with God.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; That when God places something in your
[1:01:44] heart, you're not so structured that you
[1:01:46] can't get out of the way to where God
[1:01:48] wants you to be.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; So a plan is good, but be flexible.
[1:01:57] That's right.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; So, we see that this was a time of
[1:02:04] harvest
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; for Gideon.
[1:02:08] He had did the work. He had tilled the
[1:02:11] soil. He had planted the seed. He had
[1:02:13] did everything that he could do. And he
[1:02:14] had a harvest. It was a time of harvest.
[1:02:18] And so, he was able to harvest because
[1:02:20] he went and he did all of the right
[1:02:22] things.
[1:02:24] Now, we find that his reasoning for um
[1:02:28] being at the wine press is because uh
[1:02:32] Satan is is because he was scared of of
[1:02:34] of the Amalachites and all those
[1:02:36] different people. And his reasoning for
[1:02:38] having fear was it was very natural, I
[1:02:42] suppose.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; You ever been bullied in your life?
[1:02:45] Yeah.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; You ever had someone that come up to
[1:02:48] you, you know, give me your lunch money
[1:02:49] and you know, you little you little
[1:02:52] weed, you little whatever. You know,
[1:02:56] you're different. You know, we think
[1:02:59] about bullying of of of, you know,
[1:03:01] fighting and and and stuff and just give
[1:03:04] me that and I'm bigger than you and I'm
[1:03:06] stronger than you and I'm going to take
[1:03:07] that from you and you know, bullies. You
[1:03:10] know, nobody likes a bully,
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; right? You boys know that.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; You middle-aged men know that.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; You older men know that
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; that nobody likes a bully.
[1:03:29] [Laughter]
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Are you a bully or were you bullied?
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; You know what the best thing to do to a
[1:03:40] bully is? You stand up to him. Right.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Well, what if?
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; What if?
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; So much of the time we think of bullying
[1:03:53] as fighting and getting a black eye and
[1:03:56] a bloody nose and so on and so forth.
[1:03:59] And you go home with your shirt ripped
[1:04:01] open and raggedy and I got bullied today
[1:04:04] at school and it was just terrible.
[1:04:08] But now bullying we see it goes from the
[1:04:12] physical to verbal.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; You know that you can verbally bully
[1:04:18] each other.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; And do you know it just doesn't happen
[1:04:22] at school.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; It just doesn't happen at work.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; But unfortunately you see bullying
[1:04:28] happening within the house of God.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; So how do we bully each other? Let me
[1:04:36] say this. that bullying shouldn't be
[1:04:39] once mentioned amongst the bride of
[1:04:41] Jesus Christ.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Because what it is, it is carnal
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; and a form of bullying. Why does
[1:04:49] somebody bully somebody else?
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; They do it to make themselves feel good.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; They do it because I'm bigger, I'm
[1:04:56] stronger, I'm faster, and I can do
[1:04:58] whatever I want to. Therefore, I'm going
[1:05:00] to do it.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's something within
[1:05:04] their own heart.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. that they're not happy with.
[1:05:08] Perhaps it happened down the family tree
[1:05:10] or down the line. Perhaps they were
[1:05:12] mistreated by dad.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; And because they were mistreated by dad,
[1:05:17] guess what? They want to mistreat other
[1:05:20] people.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Understand that is complete evil.
[1:05:25] And when that happens,
[1:05:28] we have to be extremely careful and we
[1:05:32] have to recognize it within our own
[1:05:34] lives
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; because each of you have it within you.
[1:05:39] No matter the size, no matter how strong
[1:05:42] you are, how weak you are, how tall you
[1:05:44] are, or how short you are, all of you
[1:05:47] have it within you. The ability to be a
[1:05:50] bully. Yeah.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not taking someone else's
[1:05:56] money. I'm not stealing their things
[1:05:58] away. No, but you're stealing their joy.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; No, but you're stealing their confidence
[1:06:06] in God. You're stealing their confidence
[1:06:09] in the word. You're stealing their
[1:06:11] confidence in the pastor, the ministry,
[1:06:13] the deacon board, whatever it may be.
[1:06:15] How am I doing that? By your words.
[1:06:21] We hear lots about cyber bullying. Cyber
[1:06:24] bullying is not something that's
[1:06:26] physical. It is something that is
[1:06:28] mental.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; And when it affects the mind, guess what
[1:06:31] it does to our spirits? It bruises our
[1:06:35] spirits.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me give you an example.
[1:06:39] The woman came up before brother
[1:06:41] Brandham, 20th century prophet. And here
[1:06:44] she was and she's t brother Brandham's
[1:06:46] talking to her. And uh forgive me if I
[1:06:48] get the exact quotations mixed up, but
[1:06:51] she's crying and and and I forget what
[1:06:54] it was. It was heart something to do
[1:06:56] with her heart or something. But what
[1:06:58] I'm trying to get to is somebody told a
[1:07:01] lie about her.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; And somebody called her a witch.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; And it bothered her so much as a
[1:07:10] daughter of God that nobody nobody
[1:07:13] physically touched her. Nobody got her
[1:07:16] in a headlock and and and and punched
[1:07:18] her a bunch of times and and took her
[1:07:19] money in her wallet and her shoes. No.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; It was verbal.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; And because somebody called her a witch
[1:07:27] and because of the person that done it,
[1:07:29] it was a minister.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; It affected her so much that here she
[1:07:35] is, she's got this trouble within her
[1:07:37] body. First of all, it starts within her
[1:07:40] mind and it goes and it bruises her
[1:07:42] spirit. And after it bruises the spirit,
[1:07:45] then it begins to take control of her
[1:07:48] physical body. Why? Why was she sick in
[1:07:51] her body? Because she was sick in her
[1:07:54] mind and in her spirit because of the
[1:07:56] wounds of the words that a preacher said
[1:07:58] to her.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; And so he told her, "You're not a
[1:08:03] witch."
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Now understand, how did he discern it?
[1:08:07] He was discerning her spirit
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; because it was on her spirit. Amen. It
[1:08:13] was her spirit that was that was
[1:08:15] attacked, bruised, and wounded.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Because it went from here into the
[1:08:22] inside,
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're not a witch. You're
[1:08:25] okay. You're just all worked up because
[1:08:27] they've been saying these things about
[1:08:28] you. You're going to be fine." And and
[1:08:30] you can tell the release in her body,
[1:08:33] the her outward expression. She's all,
[1:08:35] "Wow, well, I'm going to be healed.
[1:08:38] There's nothing wrong with me. I'm not a
[1:08:40] witch." You tell someone they're a witch
[1:08:42] more often enough they'll begin to
[1:08:44] believe it.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; So now we can bring this story into our
[1:08:49] own lives, into our own minds, into our
[1:08:52] famil family's lives, into our children,
[1:08:55] how we how we rule our homes and how we
[1:08:58] go about our business. We need to be
[1:09:00] careful number one what we say to
[1:09:02] ourselves, but number two, what we say
[1:09:05] to others around us.
[1:09:09] I'm just kidding.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Joke.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever said that to you?
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; JK. Lol.
[1:09:18] [Laughter]
[1:09:22] Huh? Everybody ever said something to
[1:09:25] you, "Oh, I'm just kidding. You look
[1:09:27] great." I do. No, you don't.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Well, do I look good or do I not? I
[1:09:33] don't know. I need someone to tell me.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; But so much of the times we have
[1:09:40] absolutely no under no no
[1:09:44] uh understanding of the effect that our
[1:09:47] words
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; are having on each other,
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; on those around us and on ourselves.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Because the more that we begin to tell
[1:09:55] ourselves things and the more that we
[1:09:57] feed our wounded spirit, guess what
[1:09:59] happens?
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; We take it out on everybody around us.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Come on. True.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; What is this called? You could call this
[1:10:09] demonology.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Of spirits
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; affecting us because brother Brandham
[1:10:15] said this. He said that words travel on
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; spirits travel on
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; words. So brother Brandham would tell us
[1:10:24] that the the titles of father son and
[1:10:26] holy ghost that the devil travels on
[1:10:29] these titles.
[1:10:31] Yes.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; So the words that we're speaking to our
[1:10:35] family members, our children, our
[1:10:37] siblings, the people at church, we ought
[1:10:40] to we ought to do away with the whole
[1:10:42] foolish gesting thing. That's what the
[1:10:44] Bible calls it.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; And guess what? We all do it.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; We've all been there. And we'll all be
[1:10:52] there again.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's in every one of us the
[1:10:56] ability to be a bully.
[1:11:01] because of your humanity.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many bullies we got within
[1:11:08] the church. Let's raise your hands.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Every hand ought to go up cuz if you're
[1:11:16] not bullying somebody else, you're
[1:11:17] bullying yourself.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; And the question to ask is, is that what
[1:11:24] I want to be?
[1:11:26] Is that what I want to be known as?
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Is that what I want my children to see
[1:11:31] me? Is that what I want the people in
[1:11:33] the church? Is that the answer to these
[1:11:35] questions is no.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; So now it's up to us to realize.
[1:11:43] Okay, Steve. Uh yeah, you need to watch
[1:11:47] your mouth. Right?
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; You need to have a little bit more
[1:11:53] respect for your fellow peers.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Cuz understand this.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; I'll say that every one of us in here
[1:12:00] are sons and daughters of God.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; That means that God is our father.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; That means whenever you come against one
[1:12:07] of God's children, you're coming against
[1:12:08] the father. And he is a jealous God
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; over his children.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is true.
[1:12:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; A lot of times I feel we need to be put
[1:12:24] in remembrance sometimes of gossip and
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; so on and so forth and this and that and
[1:12:31] this church and that church and this and
[1:12:33] that and we can all get we're such a
[1:12:36] we're such a tight-knit group
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; even within the message.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; The message of a whole is not very big.
[1:12:43] Right.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Right. And so it's so easy for us to be
[1:12:47] in everybody else's business.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You hear about these people in
[1:12:52] Canada? Did you hear about people in
[1:12:53] Australia? Did you hear this?
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Who cares?
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; But before we know it, we're we're just
[1:13:05] this. We're an open garbage can and we
[1:13:08] just take whatever everybody saying,
[1:13:09] putting all their trash in our minds.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and all of a sudden our spirit is
[1:13:15] defiled.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; God keep our spirits clean.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; So we see then Gideon here he was and he
[1:13:28] was he was he was thrashing at the wine
[1:13:30] press. He was threshing his wheat for
[1:13:32] fear of these guys because Satan was a
[1:13:34] bully. And now we we're you guys are
[1:13:37] going to be thinking about bullies all
[1:13:39] week. And that's good. It's for us.
[1:13:44] What am I doing? Hey, it's making us
[1:13:46] aware. Just like when brother James
[1:13:48] preached on on value, guess what? All
[1:13:50] week, what were we thinking about?
[1:13:52] Value. What is value to me? What is not
[1:13:55] valuable to me? What is it in my life
[1:13:57] that I'm giving too much value to?
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; We're thinking about it all week. Why?
[1:14:01] Because the word of God has an effect.
[1:14:06] So the reason that he was able to
[1:14:08] harvest was because what he had planted
[1:14:10] had come into maturity and it could be
[1:14:14] harvested for the use of food. In
[1:14:17] Matthew 13 24-30, the Bible says another
[1:14:22] parable putting forth unto them saying,
[1:14:23] "The kingdom of of heaven is likened
[1:14:25] unto a man which sowed good seed in his
[1:14:28] field. But while a man slept, his enemy
[1:14:30] came and sowed tears amongst the wheat
[1:14:32] and went his way. And when when the
[1:14:34] blade was sprung up and brought forth
[1:14:36] fruit, then appeared the tears also. So
[1:14:39] the servants of the householder came and
[1:14:41] said unto him, "Sir, didest not thou sew
[1:14:44] good seed in thy field? From whence then
[1:14:46] hath it tears?" He said unto them, "An
[1:14:48] enemy hath done this?" The servant said
[1:14:49] unto him, "Wilt thou then that we go and
[1:14:52] gather them up?" But he said, "Nay, lest
[1:14:54] while ye gather up the tears, ye root up
[1:14:57] also the wheat with them. Let them both
[1:15:00] grow until together together until the
[1:15:02] harvest. And in the time of harvest, I
[1:15:05] will say to the reapers, gather ye
[1:15:07] together first the tears, and bind them
[1:15:09] in bundles to burn them, but gather the
[1:15:12] wheat into my barn. So, we can see from
[1:15:15] this from this parable that we just read
[1:15:18] that there's two seeds that have been
[1:15:20] sold in this earth. There's been a seed
[1:15:23] of wheat and a seed of tears. A good
[1:15:25] seed and a bad seed. uh a h a a a seed
[1:15:29] of faith and a seed of unbelief. And
[1:15:32] really it boils down to two things. It
[1:15:34] boils down to the seed of God and to the
[1:15:37] seed of Satan. Amen.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; And so we see that when these seeds were
[1:15:41] first planted was in the garden of Eden
[1:15:44] when Satan threw the serpent through the
[1:15:46] beast, excuse me, he swed his seed to
[1:15:50] Eve and it had a a reproduction and it
[1:15:54] reproduced itself because every seed
[1:15:57] must bring forth after its kind. So, we
[1:16:00] see that the seed of the serpent brought
[1:16:03] forth uh a a fruit and that fruit was
[1:16:06] Cain. And we can tell by the
[1:16:08] manifestation of Cain's life that he was
[1:16:11] of the serpent, the devil. Why? Because
[1:16:15] the manifestation of his life, it
[1:16:17] brought forth after the manner of Satan.
[1:16:21] And so we understand that in order for
[1:16:24] Adam to redeem Eve, Adam had to go in
[1:16:27] onto her himself. Adam had a choice.
[1:16:31] Adam had a choice whether to leave Eve
[1:16:34] in sin, shaped in iniquity just to uh to
[1:16:37] be banished from the Garden of Eden and
[1:16:40] the very presence of God or to say she
[1:16:42] is bone of my bone and flesh of my
[1:16:45] flesh. Because she was taken of me, she
[1:16:48] is a part of me. And if she dies, I die.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Therefore, if she's going to die, I'm
[1:16:54] going to redeem her and I'm going to die
[1:16:57] with her. And so, we understand that
[1:16:59] Jesus Christ did the same for you and I.
[1:17:02] Why? Because he came to redeem those who
[1:17:05] were a part of him before the
[1:17:07] foundations of the world. How did he
[1:17:09] redeem us? He redeemed us by becoming
[1:17:12] sin.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Become sinful because there was no sin
[1:17:17] in his life. But he became sin.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; That I might become him by grace.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; The word became flesh so that his flesh
[1:17:29] might become the word. And that's where
[1:17:32] we are here in this harvest time is that
[1:17:35] the seed that was planted back here in
[1:17:37] Ephesus is now shooting forth and
[1:17:40] bringing forth fruit and reproducing
[1:17:43] itself.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:17:47] We don't have anything different than
[1:17:49] what they had in the Ephesian church
[1:17:51] age.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; We can't have
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; because the seed was planted there.
[1:17:58] That's right.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; And now it's coming to fruition here.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "When I saw the
[1:18:04] vision of the bride, the first one that
[1:18:07] came by, there she was. Oh, she was pure
[1:18:09] and clean and so on and so forth." He
[1:18:11] said, ' Then I saw the last day bride
[1:18:13] and oh man, remember is this is what my
[1:18:16] ministries produced.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; But then he saw the bride because that
[1:18:20] was the church.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; And the last day bride when she came
[1:18:24] forth, she looked exactly like the first
[1:18:27] age bride. Why? Because it was the same
[1:18:30] seed bringing forth the same
[1:18:32] manifestations.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Life of his life, bone of his bone.
[1:18:41] bringing forth him.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Adam brought forth Abel
[1:18:47] who was a righteous man who was a man of
[1:18:50] revelation. Why did Adam seed bring
[1:18:54] forth a righteous man who could walk by
[1:18:56] faith and offer a sacrifice to God uh
[1:19:00] that was pleasing to God with the
[1:19:02] correct revelation
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; because he had the right seed and he had
[1:19:06] the right father.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:08] And so you can't help what you bring
[1:19:11] forth.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; If you come from God, you're going to
[1:19:15] bring forth the fruits of that seed that
[1:19:19] lays within your life.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; So what does that do for us?
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; If we have a true revelation of who we
[1:19:29] are and where we came from and where
[1:19:30] we're going and we have a true
[1:19:32] revelation that we are sons and
[1:19:34] daughters of God, what does that do for
[1:19:36] us in our lives? It gives us peace.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Cuz we're going to find out the angel
[1:19:42] went to Gideon and he said, "Fear not.
[1:19:44] Peace be onto thee."
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; The angel's message, what did it do to
[1:19:48] him? It brought peace. It told him,
[1:19:50] "Fear not." Understand, Brother Brandham
[1:19:53] told us this. He said, "A sheep doesn't
[1:19:55] have to manufacture wool."
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; A sheep just bears wool.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; And sons and daughters of God, we don't
[1:20:03] have to make ourselves do anything. We
[1:20:06] just got to walk by faith and let God do
[1:20:09] the word. Because as long as we are in
[1:20:11] the word, as long as we are in the
[1:20:13] presence of the son, it's going to draw
[1:20:16] all of the life out of the sea to bring
[1:20:18] it to a full manifestation. Why? Because
[1:20:21] he wants to have a harvest.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Cuz we are living right now in the
[1:20:27] harvest time.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:20:36] So let me
[1:20:39] let me see here. Excuse me just for a
[1:20:42] second.
[1:20:46] So brother Brandham said in the resume
[1:20:48] of the church of the ages the church age
[1:20:51] book. And so we come to the last
[1:20:55] church age that is our age. We know it
[1:20:59] is it is the last age for the Jews are
[1:21:01] back in Palestine. Notice if you want to
[1:21:03] see God's time piece, look at the Jews.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; No matter how they got there, they are
[1:21:10] there. I love that. So, Brother Brandham
[1:21:13] is acknowledging the way that they got
[1:21:16] there might have seemed to the carnal
[1:21:18] man a little um uh heavy-handed. Let's
[1:21:22] just say that
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; that God would cause these wars and that
[1:21:26] God would cause uh Hitler and Stalin and
[1:21:29] these different men to rise up with a
[1:21:31] hatred within their hearts for the
[1:21:34] Jewish people that he would take them to
[1:21:36] concentration camps and and burn them up
[1:21:38] and smoke them up and kill them and and
[1:21:40] and do all these uh horrible horrific
[1:21:43] things to the Jewish people that he
[1:21:46] would look at that there and he would
[1:21:47] say it was the tender, merciful hand of
[1:21:50] Jehovah that was bringing the Jews Jews
[1:21:52] back into their homeland.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; So, as a carnal person, me and you, you
[1:21:57] and I, we look at it and we say, "That
[1:21:59] doesn't seem tender to me."
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; It doesn't seem very merciful to me.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; It doesn't seem like that would be the
[1:22:07] hand of God. But understand, God knows
[1:22:10] what to do to his children to get them
[1:22:12] into their uh correct uh placing within
[1:22:16] the body. Amen.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; God knew exactly what he had to do to
[1:22:20] those Jewish people in order to get them
[1:22:23] into their homeland.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; But let me ask you a question. I forget
[1:22:29] which seal it's under. The souls that
[1:22:32] are under the altar.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; You know who they are?
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; They are the they are the the Jews that
[1:22:38] were martyed
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; at those times.
[1:22:42] Right.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; So, here we see these Jews that that
[1:22:47] that had never accepted Christ. Are they
[1:22:50] a part of the 144,000?
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; 144,000 is completely different. Hasn't
[1:22:58] happened yet. But these people under the
[1:23:00] fifth seal,
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; souls under the altars crying with
[1:23:03] vengeance, how long, Lord? How long is
[1:23:06] it going to be until you avenge us of
[1:23:08] these things that happened?
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; But here they are. They're given white
[1:23:12] robes.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; So, you talk about the grace of God.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, would those Jews have
[1:23:20] been better off staying around the whole
[1:23:22] world and just living in sin and dying
[1:23:24] and go going to hell or were they better
[1:23:27] going to those concentration camps
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; in order to receive something for go
[1:23:33] from God because they were martyed of
[1:23:35] their lives just because of their
[1:23:37] nationality? Yeah,
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; that's mercy.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; That's grace.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; That's the tender hand of Jehovah.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I haven't even gotten to any
[1:23:51] of this yet. And that's okay. Sometimes
[1:23:53] sometimes uh within the scripture, we
[1:23:56] think just like Gideon and we think,
[1:23:58] well, if God is with me,
[1:24:01] number one, where's all his miracles?
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And if God is with me, number two,
[1:24:06] why are all these things happening to
[1:24:08] us?
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we don't understand in
[1:24:11] our own lives of why things are
[1:24:14] happening and this family member and
[1:24:15] that and situations and we and we don't
[1:24:18] understand why. But we've got to have
[1:24:21] faith and trust in the plan of God for
[1:24:23] our life.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; So though it may not feel tender, yet
[1:24:28] it's tender. Though it may not feel
[1:24:31] merciful, yet it's merciful. Why?
[1:24:34] Because the plan of God is greater than
[1:24:37] our emotions.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. The
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; plan of God is greater than our feelings
[1:24:42] and how we feel about things. But the
[1:24:44] plan of God is the grace of God to get
[1:24:47] us into the proper position that he
[1:24:49] might use us.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; The sword of the Lord and of Gideon.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; It becomes one. Why does it become one?
[1:25:00] Because now God uses Gideon with the
[1:25:02] sword of the Lord.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; He said it's harvest and this uh they no
[1:25:13] matter how they got there, they are
[1:25:15] there. He said and this is harvest time.
[1:25:19] So now he's talking about Leodysia. He's
[1:25:21] talking about the Jews in their
[1:25:22] homeland. And now he's bringing it to
[1:25:24] us. And he's saying this is harvest
[1:25:28] time. So what time are we living in
[1:25:30] right now? We're living in the harvest
[1:25:32] time.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; But before there can be a harvest, there
[1:25:36] has to be a ripening,
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; a maturing of both the vines. Notice,
[1:25:42] not just a maturing of of the vine of
[1:25:44] the bride of Christ, but a maturing of
[1:25:47] the serpent seed and the false vine.
[1:25:51] And what's interesting with this is
[1:25:53] Satan Satan thought he got one over on
[1:25:56] on God whenever he multiplied himself in
[1:25:59] the human race. But he took it one step
[1:26:01] further that when he saw that God wanted
[1:26:04] to have a church, now he injected
[1:26:06] himself within the the ranks of the
[1:26:10] church. And so now the true vine and the
[1:26:13] false vine is intertwined throughout the
[1:26:17] church ages throughout every church,
[1:26:19] throughout every family, and throughout
[1:26:22] every person. Because within all of
[1:26:24] those things, there's a believer, a
[1:26:26] makebeliever, and an unbeliever.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Within your own body, hallelujah, you
[1:26:32] have a believer, which is your which is
[1:26:35] that seed gene of God, which believes no
[1:26:38] matter what. You have an unbeliever
[1:26:40] which is your flesh and you have a
[1:26:42] makebeliever which is your spirit.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; And it all depends on which one you
[1:26:48] cater to.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; You say, "I feel like an unbeliever in
[1:26:53] my life." Well, you're catering to the
[1:26:55] unbeliever too much. You got to cater to
[1:26:58] the inside man. Make a differentiation
[1:27:01] between the seed and the flesh, between
[1:27:03] the believer and the unbeliever.
[1:27:08] But too much of the time with our spirit
[1:27:10] and our mind, we are catering. We got
[1:27:12] two against one.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; We got a we got an unbeliever and a
[1:27:16] makebeliever against a believer.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; And the problem with that is we only
[1:27:21] understand
[1:27:23] everything we see. We understand with
[1:27:25] the outside man.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; And we try to bring that carnality into
[1:27:30] our Christian walk with God.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Understand it. It it shouldn't be there.
[1:27:34] Yeah,
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; we shouldn't be trying to understand God
[1:27:38] with a carnal uh uncircumcised mind.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; But we ought to be understanding God
[1:27:44] through a prophet messenger and looking
[1:27:47] through the eyes of a prophet and
[1:27:49] feeding our soul and saying, "This is
[1:27:51] what I believe."
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Which says, "No matter what I see,
[1:27:57] taste, feel, smell, or hear,
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; as long as it's against the word of God,
[1:28:01] I'm not believing it. I'm not catering
[1:28:04] to it. And we ought to separate those
[1:28:06] two guys.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; That's our problem sometimes.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; We fail to split the believer from the
[1:28:15] unbeliever.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; And we cater to the unbeliever way too
[1:28:20] much. Why? Because that's where we're
[1:28:21] living at.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; And understand that's where the battle
[1:28:25] is.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; So if you say, "I'm I'm fighting. I'm in
[1:28:30] a battle and I'm struggling." That's
[1:28:32] good
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; because if you're struggling, it means
[1:28:35] there's something that's struggling
[1:28:37] against something else.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; You ever had a thumbs war with somebody?
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; It's a struggle.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; That's what's going on within our lives.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; We have a constant thumbsy war, a
[1:28:50] constant struggle between two natures.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; And that's okay.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; I would be worried if there was no
[1:28:58] struggle.
[1:29:00] Yeah.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Because if there's no struggle, there's
[1:29:03] one nature
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; and the nature is carnal.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; But if there's a struggle,
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; I want to do right.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; And it's so hard
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; and I want to do this, but I can't. And
[1:29:15] and I love it. The Apostle Paul,
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; he he here he is. He doesn't give much
[1:29:21] into his life, but he tells us his
[1:29:23] struggle.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; I'm a wretched man.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; When I want to do good, evil is present
[1:29:27] with me. And the things that I hate,
[1:29:30] somehow I end up doing them. And I
[1:29:32] realize when I want to do good, evil is
[1:29:34] present with me. Why? Because he's
[1:29:36] always with himself.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, wretched, miserable, vile
[1:29:41] man that I am. Who's going to who's
[1:29:44] going to uh uh uh deliver me from this
[1:29:46] guy?"
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; And he gives us the answer.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; There is coming a time where there's
[1:29:54] going to be a complete separation of
[1:29:56] this body and the seed.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; And it's going to be the Lord Jesus
[1:30:00] Christ that does it. And it won't be
[1:30:02] your good works. It won't be your good
[1:30:04] mindset. It won't be your good
[1:30:05] mentality. It won't be you trying to be
[1:30:07] something that you're not. It'll be God
[1:30:09] that does it.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; So, we ought to be as Ruth and just rest
[1:30:13] in the promises of God.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; But before you can do that,
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; you've got to know who you are.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you don't know who you are,
[1:30:25] there's no resting place.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Very good. That's good.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; He says there's got to be a ripening, a
[1:30:34] maturing of both the vines. The Lutheran
[1:30:38] age was the springtime. Wesleyan age was
[1:30:40] the summer of growth. The Leodysian age
[1:30:42] is a harvest time of gathering the tears
[1:30:45] for binding and burning and garnering
[1:30:47] the wheat for the Lord. Harvest time.
[1:30:51] It's amazing. So, both are being
[1:30:53] gathered. And you know what? They're
[1:30:55] both being gathered under different
[1:30:56] voices,
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; The false vine is being gathered under
[1:31:00] the voice of the church, but the true
[1:31:02] vine is being gathered under the voice
[1:31:04] of Malachi 4.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Which is the very voice of God himself.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so whatever voice that you're
[1:31:12] listening to in your life,
[1:31:15] [Music]
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; let me tell you something.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; If you're listening to Jordan Peterson
[1:31:20] more than brother Brandham, you're being
[1:31:22] gathered together for burning.
[1:31:25] If you're listening to these men that
[1:31:27] have these great ideas and and great
[1:31:30] philosophical things and and great
[1:31:32] insight to the scripture, if you're
[1:31:34] listening to that and self-help books
[1:31:36] and and and and and all those different
[1:31:39] things more than you're listening to the
[1:31:40] voice of God,
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; you're being bound.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; You're not being bound for the garner as
[1:31:47] the weak, but you're being bound for
[1:31:49] something else.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Saints of God, there's only one thing
[1:31:53] that'll loose. Cuz I believe that
[1:31:55] there's wheat plant that gets that gets
[1:31:57] caught up sometimes with the weed of the
[1:32:00] of the false vine,
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; but sometimes the only thing that'll
[1:32:03] loosen it is the voice of God in this
[1:32:05] day.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah, those things are okay. I listen to
[1:32:14] him once in a while.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Jordan Peterson. Yeah. Great insight
[1:32:18] into into certain things. Amazing. Sure.
[1:32:22] But he's binding people,
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; his voice, his teachings, Billy Graham
[1:32:27] and all Roberts,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; great men of God with great ministries
[1:32:31] of God who were used greatly of God who
[1:32:34] were angel messengers of God.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; What is their voice and their teaching
[1:32:39] doing?
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; It's binding the people and it's
[1:32:42] blinding them to the truth of the hour.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; But yet great men used greatly of God.
[1:32:53] So now you're all asking, "So brother
[1:32:55] Steven, do you think every to Billy
[1:32:58] Graham and all Roberts and and Jordan
[1:32:59] Peterson are all serpent seed?" Nope.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; I don't. Let's take his follow his
[1:33:06] teaching. He said, "I believe there's
[1:33:08] there's sons and daughters of God in all
[1:33:10] those denominations."
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Wow. You talk about grace. So notice,
[1:33:19] have you noticed that in the harvest
[1:33:22] time though there is a real accelerate
[1:33:25] acceleration in the ripening there is
[1:33:27] consequently a slowing of growth until
[1:33:30] there is no growth. by if that doesn't
[1:33:33] if that doesn't say where we're at right
[1:33:35] now, I don't know what does.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Just seems like there's no growth. That
[1:33:40] there was a fast acceleration of growth
[1:33:42] from the time that brother Brandon went
[1:33:44] off the scene to I don't know if you
[1:33:46] could put a number on it, but we can
[1:33:47] tell of an assurance that the growth,
[1:33:50] the acceleration of growth has slowed
[1:33:52] down.
[1:33:54] People aren't getting converted like
[1:33:56] they used to get converted.
[1:33:59] When was the last time that there was a
[1:34:01] a person from the street came in and got
[1:34:03] converted within the church?
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Far and few between.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Not to say that it doesn't happen.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; But it does happen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; It does.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't happen as much as it used
[1:34:16] to. Why is it our fault? No. It's just
[1:34:20] where we are in the
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; pyramid of God. Yes,
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said at the very base
[1:34:26] of the pyramid why there was 4,000 would
[1:34:28] get saved in one day and so many
[1:34:30] thousand would get saved in this other
[1:34:32] day. But as we go up towards the peak,
[1:34:34] it's one here and one there. It's one
[1:34:37] here and one there. The acceleration of
[1:34:40] growth is slowing down. But what does
[1:34:42] that mean? It means that it means that
[1:34:45] now we have almost grown because when a
[1:34:48] weak plant has grown to its full
[1:34:50] maturity, it's not going to grow
[1:34:52] anymore.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Just like you and I as human beings,
[1:34:56] when we grow to our predestined height,
[1:35:00] you can't grow any further.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; I was looking at I have pictures of me.
[1:35:06] This is not a joke, so don't laugh. I
[1:35:09] have pictures of me under 14 soccer. I
[1:35:12] was the captain of the team, goalkeeper.
[1:35:14] Okay. Um, you know where they put the
[1:35:17] tall guys in the pictures? Back row.
[1:35:21] That's right. I was in the back row.
[1:35:25] Arms folded.
[1:35:27] Goalkeeper captain. That's right. I was
[1:35:29] taller than everybody. I had a really
[1:35:32] early stunt growth or growth.
[1:35:36] But now I have a stunt growth.
[1:35:38] Now I'm growing in the wrong way.
[1:35:42] And that's just natural life. Okay?
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; People who are younger than me, you'll
[1:35:48] find out,
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; But you can only grow so tall.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; A wheat plant can only grow so high. It
[1:35:56] can only produce so much corn wheat. It
[1:35:59] can it can only do so much. Can only
[1:36:02] grow to a certain a certain uh a certain
[1:36:05] amount and produce a certain amount. But
[1:36:07] when it grows as much as it can grow,
[1:36:09] then it's got to ripen
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; because it's still green. You ever see
[1:36:13] an apple, it's fully grown, but it's
[1:36:15] still it hasn't ripened fully yet. Or a
[1:36:18] banana, take a banana, this banana is
[1:36:21] still green. We got a lot of greenness
[1:36:23] in us still. So, how do we get away? How
[1:36:26] do we get the greenness out of our lives
[1:36:28] and and and have our the fruit ripen?
[1:36:31] Well, Brother Brandham said this.
[1:36:33] Brother Brandham said, "Stay in the
[1:36:34] presence of the sun. He says, "That's
[1:36:37] where we're at. The bride has to stay in
[1:36:40] the presence of the son to bake all the
[1:36:42] greenness and ripeness out of her." Why?
[1:36:46] Because a a fruit that is not ripened is
[1:36:49] not good to partake of.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; And so now he has brought the church to
[1:36:54] a place of maturity. And I think we
[1:36:56] could all say amen to that. Do we have a
[1:36:58] mature understanding of what they didn't
[1:37:00] have 20, 30, 40 years ago of the word?
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; So at our maturity level, we're there,
[1:37:09] but our greenness of the fruit in our
[1:37:12] lives is not ripe yet.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; So until the fruit can is is is ripened
[1:37:20] enough, it cannot be harvested yet.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; So why has the Lord not come? Because
[1:37:26] the fruit hasn't ripened.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; So where are we? We're at the harvest
[1:37:32] time. Where are we in the harvest time?
[1:37:35] We are in the ripening stage of the
[1:37:37] fruit of yours and my life. Understand?
[1:37:40] We talk about the church coming to
[1:37:42] maturity, but it's the individuals that
[1:37:45] is coming to maturity that makes the
[1:37:47] church mature.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; So he says, is that not exactly what
[1:37:55] we're seeing now? The false vine is
[1:37:56] losing multitudes to communists and
[1:37:58] other various types of belief. We see
[1:37:59] that within our own country. Her numbers
[1:38:02] are not increasing as she would like us
[1:38:03] to think. Her hold on the people is not
[1:38:05] what it used to be. Christianity just
[1:38:07] really took a tank, didn't it?
[1:38:10] And in so many cases, going to church on
[1:38:12] the people is not what it used uh is is
[1:38:14] just for a show.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; And the true vine, what about her? Is
[1:38:18] she growing? Where are those vast
[1:38:21] numbers that keep coming to revival and
[1:38:23] answer altar calls? Are not most of them
[1:38:26] merely emotional in their approach or
[1:38:27] desires of something physical rather
[1:38:29] than desiring that which is truly
[1:38:31] spiritual?
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Is this age not like the day in which
[1:38:35] Noah entered the ark and the door was
[1:38:37] shut, but yet God terried in judgment
[1:38:39] seven days.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; No one was literally turned to God in
[1:38:42] those silent days. And yet it was a and
[1:38:44] yet it is the harvest time. There then
[1:38:47] must come upon the scene in this age
[1:38:50] those who will bring the wheat and tears
[1:38:51] to maturity. The tears are already
[1:38:53] maturing very fast under corrupt
[1:38:56] teachers who turn the people from the
[1:38:57] word. But the wheat also must mature.
[1:39:00] And to her God is sending the prophet
[1:39:03] messenger with the vindicated ministry
[1:39:05] that he might be accepted by the elect.
[1:39:07] They will hear him as the first church
[1:39:09] heard Paul. And she will mature in the
[1:39:11] word until becoming a word bride. The
[1:39:13] mighty works will be found in her that
[1:39:15] are always attendant upon the pure word
[1:39:17] and faith.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; So, where are we at now? We're in the
[1:39:24] ripening stage.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; A stage of getting all the greenness
[1:39:29] baked out of us. Why are we here this
[1:39:31] morning? Cuz we want the greenness out
[1:39:33] of our lives.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the sermon, the future
[1:39:40] home of the heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:39:42] earthly bride. So old man and old woman,
[1:39:45] don't you be discouraged. If you are a
[1:39:47] representation up here in this attribute
[1:39:49] of God, if you have it, if you're
[1:39:52] represented here, you're in the eternal.
[1:39:56] And if you've crossed from that seventh
[1:39:57] day into the eighth, you got into the
[1:39:59] eternal by the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:01] Spirit. You are included in this. He's
[1:40:04] he's he's pointing to a circle of an
[1:40:06] attribute of God on the on the
[1:40:08] blackboard.
[1:40:09] Now, if you're just trusting upon a
[1:40:11] sensation or jumping up and down or I do
[1:40:14] this, I keep my seventh day, I don't eat
[1:40:17] meat and things like that, that's going
[1:40:19] to perish anyhow. But this is the
[1:40:21] eternal. See, this is the eternal. The
[1:40:23] feast after the feast of tabernacles.
[1:40:26] See, the feast of tabernacles was the
[1:40:28] last feast, the seventh feast. We are
[1:40:31] worshiping now under the feast of the
[1:40:33] tabernacles, the seventh church age. In
[1:40:35] the millennium, it will be under the
[1:40:37] feast of tabernacles again in the
[1:40:39] seventh day. But then after the seventh
[1:40:42] day, we have a holy convocation, go back
[1:40:44] into the eternal hell by the eternal one
[1:40:46] that came and redeemed us and taken us
[1:40:49] back, letting us recognize that we were
[1:40:51] a part of this.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; So if you don't fully recognize it here,
[1:40:57] you'll fully recognize it over there.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; That makes makes me feel really good.
[1:41:05] in
[1:41:08] uh
[1:41:10] paragraph
[1:41:12] uh 40 457. Now, how do you know you're
[1:41:15] apart? Because at the word of the hour,
[1:41:17] the promise of the day, what is it? A
[1:41:19] restoration back to the first day, the
[1:41:21] first. See, he's talking about going
[1:41:23] back to where we came from. That's what
[1:41:26] the eighth day is all about. Seven days,
[1:41:28] seven church ages. Once the seven church
[1:41:31] ages is finished and the millennium is
[1:41:33] done with, then we go back to what we
[1:41:35] were in the beginning. And saints of
[1:41:37] God, that's what we want to go back to.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just go to a millennium.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; But I want to go past the millennium to
[1:41:47] the streets of gold
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; because there's a difference. Because in
[1:41:51] the millennium, it's still a space of
[1:41:53] time.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; A millennium is a thousand years. A
[1:41:56] thousand year reign. And after that, we
[1:41:59] walk out upon the ashes of the wicked.
[1:42:01] But we're still in the feast of
[1:42:03] tabernacles at that time, the seventh
[1:42:05] age.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; It's amazing. So, I want to go past the
[1:42:12] millennium
[1:42:13] and I want to go past what is it? Gog
[1:42:16] and
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Magog.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; To a place that is prepared
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; for me.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; That's my end goal.
[1:42:26] Notice this. It's very interesting. This
[1:42:29] is a few paragraphs back in the same
[1:42:32] scripture. Um, paragraph 215 we just
[1:42:35] finished in 24 257. Notice it was also
[1:42:40] upon this eighth day, last day, feast
[1:42:42] day of the tabernacle. Notice after
[1:42:44] that, after the last feast day, after
[1:42:47] the last church age, after the last
[1:42:49] complete seven days upon the earth,
[1:42:51] after the millennium that this holy
[1:42:55] convocation comes, remember this is
[1:42:59] feast of tabernacles, tabernacles,
[1:43:02] gathering places. Amen. Where in the
[1:43:06] millennium
[1:43:08] they shall build houses, they shall
[1:43:10] inhabit. But in the new earth, he has
[1:43:12] already went and prepared the place.
[1:43:14] It's built. We have nothing to do with
[1:43:17] building of it. Amen. Oh, I just love
[1:43:19] that word. A holy convocation. The
[1:43:22] eighth day, which is only seven days.
[1:43:24] Then on the eighth day, which comes back
[1:43:26] to the first again, comes right back to
[1:43:28] the first. The eighth day is a holy
[1:43:31] convocation. Notice seven days only has
[1:43:34] to do with the old creation, world time.
[1:43:38] Seven days, that's a millennium. the
[1:43:41] rest day. As God labored six days,
[1:43:43] rested the seventh. The church labored
[1:43:45] six days and rests the seventh, but
[1:43:48] you're still in time element.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; So when we jump back up to the previous
[1:43:55] quote, brother Brandham said, "We are
[1:43:58] worshiping now under the feast of the
[1:44:01] tabernacles." Paragraph 454.
[1:44:04] But he tells us that this feast of
[1:44:06] tabernacles
[1:44:08] it is the seventh day but he tells us
[1:44:11] very plainly there he says uh
[1:44:14] tabernacles gathering places paragraph
[1:44:16] 216. Amen. Where in the millennium?
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; So when does the feast of tabernacles
[1:44:24] take place? Takes place in the
[1:44:27] millennium.
[1:44:30] So what is this feast of tabernacles?
[1:44:33] The feast of tabernacles was the seventh
[1:44:36] tabernacle. Now, brother Brandham said
[1:44:38] we are worshiping now in the feast of
[1:44:41] tabernacles. So now we are actually
[1:44:45] worshiping God in a place that we
[1:44:48] haven't been to yet cuz he said the
[1:44:51] feast of the tabernacles is in the
[1:44:53] millennium which means it's a changing
[1:44:56] of dwelling.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; So the feast of tabernacles what they
[1:45:00] did was is called the booths. Have you
[1:45:02] ever read that within your scripture? It
[1:45:04] was at the final time of harvest. And
[1:45:07] they would have the the harvest time and
[1:45:09] they would take these little booths and
[1:45:11] they would they would build these booths
[1:45:13] um near to the fields where they were
[1:45:15] harvesting. And they would do that in
[1:45:18] remembrance of their journey through the
[1:45:20] wilderness of how they had booths and
[1:45:22] houses and how they would build these
[1:45:24] things and how that God would meet their
[1:45:26] needs. He would feed him with mana and
[1:45:29] he would give him uh uh uh uh water from
[1:45:32] a rock. Uh though they were dwelling in
[1:45:35] different dwelling tabernacles,
[1:45:38] the feast of tabernacles,
[1:45:41] the feast of booths, a changing of
[1:45:44] dwelling place, a changing of bodies, a
[1:45:48] changing of dispensations, a changing of
[1:45:51] a dwelling place. So now we're not there
[1:45:54] yet, but we are worshiping there right
[1:45:58] now.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; So what is it that what is it that we
[1:46:01] all love to worship about? It's the
[1:46:04] changing of our bodies.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; The changing of this vile, miserable
[1:46:08] man, the changing of this dwelling place
[1:46:11] from this earthly to the heavenly.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; We are already worshiping there now.
[1:46:17] That's where we're at. But the actual
[1:46:20] takes place in its in its reality form
[1:46:23] is in the millennium
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; when our bodies are changed, our
[1:46:28] dwelling places are changed, our booths
[1:46:30] are changed, then we're not only
[1:46:33] worshiping in the feast of tabernacles,
[1:46:36] but we'll be dwelling and living in the
[1:46:39] feast of tabernacles.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:43] So when does the feast what comes after
[1:46:46] the feast of tabernacles?
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; A holy convocation.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham calls it the eighth
[1:46:52] day.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Back to the beginning again because the
[1:46:56] feast of tabernacles. We're still in
[1:46:58] time element.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; The millennium thousand-y year reign is
[1:47:02] still time. Time has not been done away
[1:47:04] with yet. But after the seventh comes
[1:47:07] the eighth. And the eighth brings us
[1:47:09] back to the first. And the first is
[1:47:11] where we want to get to back to where we
[1:47:14] were in the beginning with God.
[1:47:16] Hallelujah.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; The feast of tabernacles.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; What a day that'll be.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; So now we see picking up our our story
[1:47:30] with Gideon. Um
[1:47:33] in verse 12 of chapter 6, brother
[1:47:36] Brandham says or the Bible says, "And
[1:47:39] there came an angel of the Lord and set
[1:47:41] under an oak." Verse 11, "Which was an
[1:47:43] Ofra that pertained to Joash the
[1:47:45] aiserite and his son Gideon threshed
[1:47:48] wheat by the wine press to hide it from
[1:47:49] the Midionites. And the angel of the
[1:47:51] Lord appeared unto him and said unto
[1:47:52] him, the Lord is with thee, thou mighty
[1:47:55] man of valor." And God Gideon said unto
[1:47:57] God, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with
[1:47:59] us, why then has all this befallen us?
[1:48:01] And where be all his miracles which our
[1:48:03] fathers told us of sand? Did not the
[1:48:05] Lord bring us up from Egypt? But now the
[1:48:07] Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us
[1:48:10] into the hands of the Midianites.
[1:48:14] So now he's beginning to question, hey,
[1:48:18] if God is with us, why are we here? Why
[1:48:21] is all this befallen us? If I am a
[1:48:24] mighty man of valor, why am I why am I
[1:48:28] hiding? Why am I threshing wheat in a
[1:48:31] wine press? Why do I have this fear
[1:48:34] about me? It's because he never had a a
[1:48:37] a he never understood his identity from
[1:48:41] God.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; He had never really met God face to
[1:48:44] face. He was living his life according
[1:48:48] to his family heritage.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; He didn't understand where he was from.
[1:48:55] And because he didn't know or he didn't
[1:48:57] have that relationship with God yet, he
[1:49:00] had never met God face to face. Guess
[1:49:02] what? He had no value in the things of
[1:49:06] God.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; When you don't know your true identity,
[1:49:11] you cannot have value in it.
[1:49:15] But when you have a true identity and
[1:49:18] when you don't have no value in who you
[1:49:21] are as a son of God, you'll take your
[1:49:23] value from somewhere else.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; So if you don't understand who you are
[1:49:28] in the great plan of God and why he has
[1:49:31] uh sent you here at such a time as this,
[1:49:34] without an identity, there is no value.
[1:49:37] And if you don't value the things of
[1:49:39] God, you will not value yourself as a
[1:49:42] son of God.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Just like the one guy uh um uh um what
[1:49:48] would you call it? He was um you
[1:49:50] remember the slave. The slave.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; He's different. This guy, man, he I want
[1:49:56] to buy him. He's a good worker. He he
[1:49:58] this and that and the other. He's
[1:49:59] different than all these other guys.
[1:50:00] Don't got to whip him to work. He's a
[1:50:02] good guy. And no, he's not for sale.
[1:50:04] Well, I want him. He's not for sale.
[1:50:05] Well, what makes him different? Do you
[1:50:07] feed him different? No, I don't feed him
[1:50:08] different. Does he sleep somewhere
[1:50:09] different? No, he sleeps everybody else.
[1:50:11] Why is he so different? You want to know
[1:50:14] why he was different than everybody
[1:50:15] else?
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; He had value.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; He had a value of where he came from.
[1:50:22] And he understood not only who his
[1:50:25] father was
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; cuz you can understand who your father
[1:50:28] is, but not who you are. So he not only
[1:50:31] understood who his father was, but he
[1:50:33] realized and he understood the blood
[1:50:36] that dwells within him is not a normal
[1:50:39] blood. It's the blood of a king of a
[1:50:41] royal family. And because he had value
[1:50:44] in that, his life was different than
[1:50:46] everybody else's.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Gordmen.
[1:50:51] So now you can take this this this this
[1:50:56] identity and value that with identity
[1:50:59] there comes value. Talking about
[1:51:01] Christianity
[1:51:03] and we can take that and you can take a
[1:51:06] boy and a girl that's raised in the
[1:51:08] church that doesn't know their true
[1:51:10] identity as a son or a daughter of God.
[1:51:12] Therefore they don't value the things of
[1:51:14] God and it's in our lives. Yeah.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; So we could take a young girl for
[1:51:20] instance or let me say a young woman and
[1:51:23] she comes into womanhood and she doesn't
[1:51:25] understand the value of her of her body
[1:51:28] that God has given her. It's a it's it's
[1:51:30] it's a jewel.
[1:51:33] Something that should be protected. It's
[1:51:35] something that should be um reserved and
[1:51:38] not flaunted or shown before everybody
[1:51:40] else.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:42] That's a godly value
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; of a young lady that will dress in
[1:51:47] modesty and and and with a meek and
[1:51:50] quiet and gentle spirit.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; But take that same person that has no
[1:51:56] heavenly identity
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; and they'll take their identity from
[1:52:00] their carnal natural family.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Now the opposite happens.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Now the body is shown. Now the body is
[1:52:10] flaunted. Now, there's no meekness.
[1:52:12] There's no there's none of these
[1:52:14] attributes that we expect from a
[1:52:16] daughter of God by the word of God.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; You guys understand that?
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Not not just cuz the minister's saying
[1:52:22] it, but because it's scriptural.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; That's right, sir.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; And so, without a heavenly value, a
[1:52:28] heavenly identity. We have no value in
[1:52:31] the things of God to live our lives
[1:52:33] accordingly.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; So, now take a young man. It's the exact
[1:52:37] same thing.
[1:52:39] No heavenly identity,
[1:52:41] no spiritual value. And it shows in our
[1:52:45] lives. Now what happens is if you put
[1:52:47] these two together,
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; what kind of marriage are they going to
[1:52:51] have?
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; It's going to be a mess.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Why is it going to be a mess? Because
[1:52:58] there's no heavenly identity. And the
[1:53:00] only thing
[1:53:03] that will keep a family together in this
[1:53:05] age is a heavenly identity within the
[1:53:09] family between the man and the woman.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; If there's identity missing between one
[1:53:14] or the other, the family is going to
[1:53:16] have a hard time.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; And the children are going to have a
[1:53:20] hard time. Why? Because they're fighting
[1:53:22] and waring one with another.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's an identity missing
[1:53:28] somewhere. Yeah.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; So what happens now we get two people
[1:53:34] that have an identity crisis
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; and within the message, you know, I
[1:53:38] wasn't raised in the message. You know
[1:53:39] what? You know what our our biggest
[1:53:41] fault is within the message? As soon as
[1:53:43] a girl turns 16 and he turns 19, yeah,
[1:53:45] let's get them hooked up. Let's get them
[1:53:47] married.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Cuz they've been raised in church. That
[1:53:50] doesn't mean squat.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; That don't mean nothing.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:56] It doesn't just, well, we were born in
[1:53:57] the church and we were raised around it
[1:53:59] and yeah, praise the Lord. Good for you.
[1:54:01] That's wonderful.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; But yet, if there's no heavenly
[1:54:04] identity,
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; that identity cannot uh transfer. Amen.
[1:54:10] It cannot transfer into the family.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; So, you see the importance in in number
[1:54:16] one, having yourself right
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; before you get married.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; You got to be right cuz if you're not
[1:54:21] right, the marriage won't be right. And
[1:54:23] the same goes on the other side.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; But not only you have to make yourself
[1:54:27] right, you have to make sure that the
[1:54:29] person you're picking is right.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Oh, he he's got
[1:54:34] small feet and smells good." That's what
[1:54:36] the girl told him. Right.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Great.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; His feet won't smell good for very much
[1:54:44] longer.
[1:54:48] That's a that's an excuse
[1:54:51] from a person that has no heavenly
[1:54:53] identity
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; because a sister that has a heavenly
[1:54:57] identity will look at the guy and say,
[1:54:59] "He's not spiritual.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; He can't keep a job.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; How's he going to raise?
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; How's he going to treat me right? How
[1:55:07] how's this going to happen?" And that's
[1:55:09] what a spiritual girl should be
[1:55:10] thinking.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; And a spiritual guy should be thinking.
[1:55:15] What kind of mother is she going to be
[1:55:16] to my kids? Right.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Not if she already has a good job.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Well, she has a good job already. She
[1:55:28] got money in the bank.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; She got this. She's a catch,
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; but she's not spiritual.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; What happens if she has all those things
[1:55:38] and she's got that wild sterei
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; that if you're not spiritual, you don't
[1:55:44] catch it? Amen.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; And what happens if you're not spiritual
[1:55:47] and you don't catch it? We're going to
[1:55:48] have problems.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; You see, it all transfers.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; And so then take the two people,
[1:55:58] no identity. They're going to church.
[1:56:00] They're they're they're paying their
[1:56:02] tithe. They're doing what's right, but
[1:56:04] yet there's there's no true identity
[1:56:06] with their father, their father, God.
[1:56:09] And so they begin to look elsewhere and
[1:56:11] to get their identity, whether it's in
[1:56:13] their their their family nature,
[1:56:15] whatever it may be, I don't know. But
[1:56:17] now take them and have them have
[1:56:19] children and have them raise the
[1:56:21] children. What kind of children are we
[1:56:23] going to have?
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; You see, it's it's pretty serious, isn't
[1:56:27] it?
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; And and and and I feel that we've
[1:56:32] married kids off too early.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; I do. That's And if I'm wrong in that,
[1:56:36] that's okay. That's my opinion. Yeah,
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; I was 25 when I got married, okay? And I
[1:56:42] was not ready a day before.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Some of you are maybe more mature than
[1:56:47] me, and that's good. I hope you are. But
[1:56:50] there's absolutely no way that I was
[1:56:52] ready for marriage before 25. I just
[1:56:55] wasn't.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; It would have been a mess.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Absolute mess because I was all over the
[1:57:02] place.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Ah, should I go here or here? Didn't
[1:57:06] know how to take care of things. and you
[1:57:07] know just doing my thing and I wasn't
[1:57:11] ready before. Amos is laughing cuz he
[1:57:13] knows. He knows me before I was 25. And
[1:57:17] then marriage marriage changed
[1:57:19] everything. Nonsense. No, it didn't.
[1:57:23] Doesn't change anything.
[1:57:26] But I got a wife that had a heavenly
[1:57:28] identity.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; And that helped me a lot. So did I. But
[1:57:32] before that,
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; good luck, man.
[1:57:37] True.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; It's interesting, isn't it?
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; So now
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; it's of vital importance. Start off with
[1:57:45] the guys. Get your heavenly identity
[1:57:48] first from Christ
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; before you start looking at other
[1:57:50] things.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Once you get that, then you're on the
[1:57:53] basis of moving forward.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; And then we have young couples and we
[1:57:56] have families and stuff. Hey, where
[1:57:58] where are we getting our identities
[1:58:00] from? Because where we get it from,
[1:58:02] that's where we're going to place our
[1:58:04] value. And if we have a heavenly
[1:58:06] identity, our values is going to be
[1:58:09] scripturally based. Not man-made based,
[1:58:11] not Joe Rogan based, not uh Jordan
[1:58:14] Peterson based, not not all these guys
[1:58:16] based. No, it's going to be scripturally
[1:58:18] based by the word of the Lord.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; And when we can do that, and we can just
[1:58:22] be patient.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; We can just be patient. We can be
[1:58:26] patient before we choose, patient when
[1:58:28] we get married, patient with our kids,
[1:58:30] just be patient with ourselves.
[1:58:33] Understand God will do a work in our
[1:58:35] lives.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; But it all comes down to identity
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; and value.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; what's his name? Gideon. Didn't
[1:58:49] understand. He didn't have he didn't
[1:58:52] have no value. But all of a sudden, he
[1:58:54] the Lord begins to tell him and and
[1:58:56] share things with him and tell him he's
[1:58:58] a he's a mighty man of valor and and and
[1:59:00] begins to tell him, "Hey, you can do
[1:59:02] this and you are a son of God and you
[1:59:03] are a Christian and you know so on and
[1:59:05] so forth." He begins encouraging Gideon,
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; And so let me keep reading here. Fine.
[1:59:12] Um he makes a cake and everything for
[1:59:15] Gideon or Gideon makes a cake for the
[1:59:17] Lord and he presented it. Verse 20. And
[1:59:21] the angel of God said unto him, this is
[1:59:23] ver chapter six. The angel of the Lord
[1:59:25] said unto him, take the flesh and the
[1:59:27] unleaven cakes and lay them upon this
[1:59:29] rock and pour out the broth. And he did
[1:59:31] so. And the angel of the Lord put the
[1:59:33] end of the staff that was in his hand
[1:59:35] and touched the flesh and the unleavened
[1:59:36] cakes. And there rose up fire out of the
[1:59:38] rock and consumed the flesh and the
[1:59:40] unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the
[1:59:41] Lord departed out of his sight. And
[1:59:45] perceived that this was an angel of the
[1:59:46] Lord. Gideon said, "Alas, oh Lord God,
[1:59:49] for because I've seen an angel of the
[1:59:51] Lord face to face." And the Lord said
[1:59:53] unto him, "Peace be unto thee.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Fear not, thou shalt not die."
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Then Gideon built an altar there unto
[2:00:01] the Lord, and called it Jehovah Shalom,
[2:00:03] unto this day. It is yet an Ofra of the
[2:00:06] Abiserites.
[2:00:09] God had to get God spent many years
[2:00:13] getting Gideon to the threshing floor or
[2:00:15] to the wine press to the to thresh his
[2:00:18] wheat.
[2:00:20] It didn't take overnight.
[2:00:23] You know, it's it's pretty interesting
[2:00:24] when you think of it this way. We think
[2:00:26] of of where we're at in life and we
[2:00:29] think of the trials and this and that
[2:00:31] and the other, but we don't understand
[2:00:33] the plan of God and how long it has
[2:00:36] taken God to get us to a certain place.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; So, we look at it and we see Gideon and
[2:00:41] we say, "Man, Gideon was a man of no
[2:00:43] faith. He was he was fearful. He he he
[2:00:46] was hiding and so on and so forth."
[2:00:48] That's our carnality. But when you look
[2:00:50] at it through God's eyes, you realize
[2:00:52] that God met him there. Uh God had an
[2:00:55] appointment to meet with Gideon.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; But in order to meet Gideon there, God
[2:01:01] had to make a way for Gideon to be
[2:01:03] there.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; It's amazing. So all of those years of
[2:01:06] of those guys stealing their crops and
[2:01:09] stealing their animals and taking up the
[2:01:11] land and so on and so forth. It caused
[2:01:13] Gideon to get into a place where he was
[2:01:15] like, "Well, the only place that I can
[2:01:17] thresh my wheat is back here in the
[2:01:20] secret place where no one else is." And
[2:01:22] that's where God meets us is in the
[2:01:25] secret places. And those secret places,
[2:01:29] they change destination, they change
[2:01:32] location. Uh but it's it's when God can
[2:01:35] get us alone.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; That now he begins to talk to Gideon.
[2:01:40] All those years of pushing Gideon there
[2:01:42] until finally we would say the stars
[2:01:45] aligned for God.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Right there.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; This is his time. this is his
[2:01:52] appointment. I'm going to meet Gideon
[2:01:55] right there. And Gideon had no idea.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we have absolutely no
[2:02:02] idea what God is doing in our lives.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you this morning
[2:02:08] that all things work together for the
[2:02:10] good. No matter where you're at in life
[2:02:13] or what has brought you to the place
[2:02:15] where you are in life, it has all been
[2:02:17] the hand of God getting you to that
[2:02:20] place where he can deal with you
[2:02:22] directly.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; And it was in that place of
[2:02:28] uh fearfulness and loneliness
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; that God now reveals himself. God didn't
[2:02:34] call himself Jehovah Shalom.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; It was Gideon. Yes.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; It was Gideon's revelation
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; and Gideon said this. Wow. Fear not.
[2:02:46] Wow. Praise the Lord.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Shalom.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Sometimes God brings us to places that
[2:02:54] he might reveal certain attributes of
[2:02:56] himself to us.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; As the musicians come,
[2:03:04] we'll bring it to a close. Vaniah asked
[2:03:06] me what time service will be over today
[2:03:11] and and I said 12:00.
[2:03:15] I'm a dad of my work today.
[2:03:21] Chapter 7 and verse uh
[2:03:26] I think it's 18.
[2:03:28] That's my opening.
[2:03:30] Let me see here.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Is it is 18?
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Good. Chapter 7 and verse 18
[2:03:40] says, "When I blow with the trumpet,
[2:03:44] I and all that are with me."
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Then blow ye the trumpets also on every
[2:03:48] side of the camp and say, "The sword of
[2:03:50] the Lord and of Gideon."
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Gideon went from a place of of of hiding
[2:03:58] and threshing at the wine press. Then he
[2:04:01] got in of the Lord. He had a call of God
[2:04:04] on his life.
[2:04:06] And then as he began, the Bible said he
[2:04:08] got anointed and he began to blow a
[2:04:10] trumpet and gather all the people. And
[2:04:12] then as he gathered all the people, he
[2:04:15] he says to himself, "Well, now what?" So
[2:04:17] now he puts a fleece before the Lord. He
[2:04:20] says, "Oh, God, if this is really you,
[2:04:22] let the fleece be this and that. Let the
[2:04:23] dew be on the fleece and the dry
[2:04:25] ground." And you know the story. I can
[2:04:28] relate so much to this story that God
[2:04:32] puts a call in your life. He asks you to
[2:04:34] do something to go somewhere, whatever,
[2:04:36] and then you don't want to do it, then
[2:04:38] you get excited about doing it and then
[2:04:40] you think, "Oh gosh, no.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Let's do a let's make a fleece."
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; So much of the time we make all these
[2:04:47] fleeces before the Lord
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; and God just wants us to walk by faith.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; And so he God just so encouraged Gideon.
[2:04:55] went up and he heard the dream and the
[2:04:57] the the the uh interpretation of the
[2:05:00] dream and he said, "Wow, this is all
[2:05:02] true. God is actually going to do this
[2:05:04] through me." So now he was he was so uh
[2:05:08] strong in his faith and he was so
[2:05:10] certain. He goes, "Here's what we're
[2:05:11] going to do
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; and we're going to do this that and the
[2:05:14] other and we're going to blow the
[2:05:15] trumpets and we're going to say the
[2:05:17] sword of the Lord and of Gideon."
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Is no longer the sword of the Lord. What
[2:05:24] is the sword of the Lord? It's the word
[2:05:26] of God.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; So what was Gideon doing now?
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Gideon was becoming one with the word.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Gideon did not fight with swords. He
[2:05:37] fought with the trumpet and with lights
[2:05:39] and smashed these things. He didn't have
[2:05:41] a sword. So why would he say the sword
[2:05:43] of the Lord and Gideon?
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Because now Gideon was becoming one with
[2:05:48] the word.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Gideon was becoming one with the
[2:05:52] sword of the word, with the promise of
[2:05:55] the word. He was saying, "This is what
[2:05:57] the word has promised me today. And I'm
[2:05:59] going to take the word. I'm going to
[2:06:01] become one with the word and I'm going
[2:06:04] to move forward with the word and I'm
[2:06:05] going to fight and I'm going to battle
[2:06:07] and I'm going to struggle and I'm going
[2:06:09] to overcome."
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; So now, Brother Brandham says that sword
[2:06:14] caught in my hand.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; He said it fit my hand just perfectly.
[2:06:18] He calls it the sword of the Lord, which
[2:06:22] is the word of the Lord.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; So now, what's he doing? He's becoming
[2:06:28] one
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; with the word.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Just like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, they
[2:06:34] were told, "Hey, eat up the scroll."
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Why did they have to eat up the scroll?
[2:06:40] Because they were the prophet and the
[2:06:41] word was becoming one. Yeah.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:8. You know what's it's
[2:06:48] really interesting? If you go and you
[2:06:51] look up, take the little book, Brother
[2:06:53] Brandham hardly says it.
[2:06:56] He hardly speaks about Revelations 10:8.
[2:06:58] It's interesting. Why? Because it his
[2:07:00] part to fulfill.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; What is Revelations 10:8?
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; John, take the little book.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Eat it up.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So then John, he hears the
[2:07:11] word of the Lord and he just doesn't
[2:07:13] stand there.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. I'll do it. And he doesn't
[2:07:17] take it.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; No, give it to me.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Give me the little book.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Give me the word. I want it.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; You're telling me to partake of it? That
[2:07:26] means I'm a part of it. I want to become
[2:07:28] a part of the word. So now he does what
[2:07:30] he's told. Here, give it to me. He
[2:07:32] doesn't ask all politely and stuff. No,
[2:07:34] it's his. He wanted it. So he takes it
[2:07:37] and he partakes of it. What happens when
[2:07:39] he partakes of it? He becomes one with
[2:07:42] the word.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you a question. Was the
[2:07:49] book still open when he ate it?
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Sure it was.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; What happened to it? It changed.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; No longer a book is what we would see a
[2:08:03] book,
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; but now it becomes an earthn vessel.
[2:08:07] So now the book changes dispensations.
[2:08:11] It changes form
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; to where it's no longer a dead letter.
[2:08:15] It's no longer a closed book. And it's
[2:08:17] not just an open book, but it's an open
[2:08:20] book now. That's a part of me. And I am
[2:08:22] becoming an open book.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; And so now we become these open book
[2:08:28] people. That's what we are. We believe
[2:08:31] in the open book in the revealed word.
[2:08:34] But what does it mean?
[2:08:37] Is it just a a saying?
[2:08:40] Is it just something that we that we
[2:08:42] rejoice over and and give me the book
[2:08:44] and let me eat the book and I become the
[2:08:45] book. And
[2:08:47] so what does it actually mean?
[2:08:51] Let me share you a little bit about what
[2:08:52] it means. It means now that your life
[2:08:55] becomes an open book.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; So what does that mean?
[2:09:02] That means we don't have no more Achans.
[2:09:05] [Music]
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; Achen was living his life as a closed
[2:09:09] book.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; These Babylonian garments and stuff.
[2:09:13] Yeah. I'll take it. I'll keep it in my
[2:09:14] home. I'll bury it. No one's going to
[2:09:16] know.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Though he was part of, let me say the
[2:09:20] open book revival of taking the land,
[2:09:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the
[2:09:25] promise that God was giving. He was a
[2:09:27] part of it. But yet he felt that he
[2:09:30] could still be a closed book within his
[2:09:33] own home.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; And we all know what happens. So what
[2:09:37] does it mean for us? It means that our
[2:09:39] home is an open book.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; It means that our cell phones is an open
[2:09:46] book.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; It means that when we're by ourselves,
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; we are open books.
[2:09:53] We are not open books at church and
[2:09:55] closed books everywhere else we go and
[2:09:57] doing as we please. No
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; because we have partaken of the word.
[2:10:03] This open book we apply it to our lives
[2:10:06] and now our lives is open before all
[2:10:10] people.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Now we got nothing to hide. Now we got
[2:10:14] no seals in our life now and people we
[2:10:17] want to use our nature and our family
[2:10:18] and all this nonsense. We are an open
[2:10:21] book. The opening of the seals has
[2:10:24] opened our lives up now that we be
[2:10:27] become a living oracle of God. A written
[2:10:30] epistle that is read of all men.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; It's more than just words.
[2:10:39] [Music]
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; It's a life.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; So, you have the ability to look at my
[2:10:46] life and to know if Stephen has partaken
[2:10:50] of the open book. That's right. Yeah.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Look at my life. My wife's like our
[2:10:55] household. How I live.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; Does he really believe the open word?
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; The manifestation will make it known.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; So, let me end with this.
[2:11:09] What kind of book are you producing in
[2:11:11] your life?
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're living. The seals have been
[2:11:15] loosed. Praise God. It's been opened.
[2:11:19] It's been revealed. We're waiting for
[2:11:20] the coming of the Lord. We're we're
[2:11:22] we're at a place of maturity.
[2:11:25] We're we've grown. We're we're
[2:11:27] understanding the word. But I wonder
[2:11:30] where we are in our ripeness.
[2:11:34] I wonder where the fruit what kind of
[2:11:36] ripeness our fruit is bearing. And only
[2:11:39] you can answer that.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; And it all comes from your identity.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:45] Because when you have a true identity of
[2:11:47] God and the word for this day and what
[2:11:50] has been set before us and what we're
[2:11:52] partaking of, it will be valuable to us
[2:11:55] as believers. And we won't close it up
[2:11:58] whenever we want to, but it'll be open
[2:12:01] before everybody.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet this
[2:12:05] morning.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:07] [Music]
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, there
[2:12:19] There have been times I didn't know
[2:12:22] right from wrong.
[2:12:27] But in every situation,
[2:12:31] God give blessed consolation
[2:12:36] that my trials only come to make me
[2:12:40] strong.
[2:12:42] Oh,
[2:12:45] through it all.
[2:12:49] Through it all,
[2:12:53] I learn to trust in Jesus.
[2:12:57] I learn to trust in God.
[2:13:02] Through it all,
[2:13:06] through it all,
[2:13:10] I learn to depend upon his word.
[2:13:16] [Music]
[2:13:19] I've been to lots of places
[2:13:23] and I've seen a lot of faces.
[2:13:27] There have been times
[2:13:29] I felt so alone.

[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we
[2:21:07] Lord, we come to the end of this
[2:21:08] service, Lord.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. Lord, realizing that it's nothing
[2:21:14] within us, that we're here, but it's
[2:21:17] just by grace through faith in you and
[2:21:21] realizing that it's nothing that we can
[2:21:23] do of oursel that we could earn,
[2:21:27] but Lord, it's freely given by you. We
[2:21:30] just thank you for the word that we've
[2:21:32] heard this morning,
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Lord. A true
[2:21:36] to me encouragement, Lord, that there's
[2:21:38] a provided way that you've given.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; Lord. This word and this message that
[2:21:44] you've provided in this end time. It's
[2:21:48] nor leading us to a dead end, but a a
[2:21:51] clear path, a way forward, a promise of
[2:21:56] what is to come. Oh, we thank you for
[2:21:58] Brother Steve, Lord. the word that
[2:22:00] you've put in his heart. Lord, I truly

[2:22:05] morning.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, that you're bringing him to a
[2:22:08] higher level and therefore you want us
[2:22:10] to rise up as well. Lord, to take self
[2:22:13] inventory of our yourself, Lord. I
[2:22:16] believe each one of us could walk away
[2:22:18] this morning and Lord look at our lives,
[2:22:21] how we live on a day-to-day basis.
[2:22:25] Lord, to find what we
[2:22:28] deal with
[2:22:30] and the things that we go through.
[2:22:33] And we just look to you for all things.
[2:22:37] For you're the same yesterday, today,
[2:22:39] and forever. And what you've done all
[2:22:42] throughout time, you'll continue to do
[2:22:45] in each one of our lives. Oh, we just
[2:22:47] love you. We thank you. I ask that you
[2:22:51] would also just remember the needs once
[2:22:52] again that were pinned down for they
[2:22:54] were pinned in faith. Lord, give each
[2:22:57] one faith to receive. Lord, if they're
[2:23:00] asking for a friend, Lord, may you give
[2:23:03] their friend faith to receive. And Lord,
[2:23:06] that you would encourage them that
[2:23:08] you're alive and well. I just ask you
[2:23:11] would be with each one, go with us about
[2:23:13] our week. Lord, may we take this
[2:23:16] presence with us as we go. Oh, we just
