Prophet taught us that science and education is the Devil's Bible and how that they would be forced to eat of the tree of knowledge but God I pray that you will keep them balanced in this hour and this day in which father the enemy does everything he can if he can't destroy the mom and dad he'll go for the children if he can't get them he'll get the grandchildren he'll just do anything that he can to to dissuade them discourage them to entice them to seduce them but father we're praying them for them right now and asking you to put the blood of Jesus Christ over each one of them to put them into a place a Zone a place father that will be a place of safety we know that Jesus when he was here and he prayed for the people he says I send you as sheep among wolves and we realize father that we are in a a very perilous time we're in a time when the devil's doing all that he can but father we just are asking as your bride as your body to watch over these little ones keep them even as Jesus

Minister Thy Word in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen amen God bless you all this morning let's just re remain standing thank you musicians each and everyone amen thank Brother Don Saunders uh amen sister Sharon see them back here I got a new hat he got me a new hat and it it matches my suit I wanted to wear it out here but you don't wear a hat in the sanctuary so but he got me a nice beautiful gray hat it it goes it matches so I so very pleased will wear it after service and you all can take my picture if you want to but uh amen amen now saints of God there are certain things that brother Brandon preaches that makes us aware of the time the element the season in which we're in amen he take sermons sir is this the time who do you say that is what is this attraction who is this mzc yes he preaches sermons such as Blasphemous names enticing Spirits anointed ones at the end time and he begins to rightly divide the word of God for this hour amen and certain sermons he will say and from that that time knowing that there was a junction of time that something happen that made an irreversible course in people's lives and in things they do we see America on the brink of the biggest change she's ever made and ever going to be made among our government I am not a politician not a Republican and Democrat I am a Christian amen amen but I want to say you're about to see the biggest change that America has ever seen and it's not going to be for the better that's right he said the times will wax worse and worse so when you think of worst case scenario then you know the direction we're going brother brandham in 1950 six said America has rejected the gospel and he says I no longer pray for he says you could put a George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in every office and he said she's on an irreversible course amen and we're there now I'm going to be speaking some things this morning that is to this church and to my sheep and yet we have many people that archive our sermons they listen to them there are many people that stream our services live around the world and um uh so they listen to what I preach and some um have uh chose to speak against me and to put things up on YouTube and to go against me and that's fine hey hey I do not surf the Internet I'm not looking for you know who's who and what's saying and this and that because let me tell you all it'll do is bring confusion you know I don't tell you I forbid you not n hey hey the critics are going to always be there the most misunderstood person that ever lived was Jesus Christ that's right and so I uh say unto you this morning that something I had a brother now watch this now I my family was with there my wife asked me last night honey are you done with the your sermon I said yeah I said I I I said all I have to do is put a couple touches and print it out you know and and everything and so I had this sermon typed out and ready to print last night and then this morning a brother in a message sent me uh an email showing something that was coming across and I'm going to share that with you today and it's going to be startling but I take my stand with Jesus Christ amen I am not a novice I am an elder in the message I thank God for his grace it's not me that's holding God God is holding me so I thank God for that brother Neil is this your brother it is well God bless you is it's good to have you here sir it's a pleasure each and everyone I greet you in the lovely name of Jesus Let's uh remain standing turn with me in your Bibles to 2 Timothy 4 veres 1-4 I charge thee 2 Timothy 4 verse1 I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reason reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust they shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables amen if I can put in your remembrance this is the scripture that the Holy Spirit had told the prophet to put in the Cornerstone of brandom Tabernacle make full proof of thy Ministry for the time will come that day has arrived amen amen we are here yes I can say this day yes this prophecy is fulfilled and I will give you some evidence of that happening and it just uh inside uh I tell you it troubles me and yet I say in the midst of troublesome times God's got it all in control hallelujah amen amen heavenly father as we have read Thy word we ask your blessing upon it we pray that you will open our eyes of understanding father we see as the early church as all the way from the book of Genesis to the Book of Revelation we see the mixing of seed we see the doctrines of devils we see those withstanding the truth whether it was in the time of Moses whether it was in the time of Jesus whether it was in the time of the early Apostles until this very hour father we see it therefore father we ask give us discernment of spirit father and may the Holy Spirit Come and Quicken our lives and let us have an understanding of what's going on in this hour and in this day we ask for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you can be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord amen now the Bible says they shall turn away their ears from the truth and should be turned unto fables Fable according to Webster's Dictionary is a legendary story of Supernatural Happ it is a narration and intended to teach a lesson especially one in which animals speak and act like people and number three was it's falsehood turn the truth into falsehood amen we are in a time when what is truth and our young people are being sacrificed into the curriculum of higher education and we got educated people that cannot tell you what is a woman they cannot Define it I had somebody send me a little clip of a Preacher speaking and I'm going to reenact a little bit of what he said he's a black man got a very large following and he says we got people today that cannot Define what a woman is what is a woman he says I'll tell you what a woman is your mama it is just that simple yeah Hallelujah and every one of you got one that's a definition all right second Peter chapter 2 I wish to expound on some things here so we'll go to Second Peter 2 veres 1-5 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who shall privy bring in damnable heresies even denying the Lord that bought them and bring upon themselves Swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious Ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of and through covetousness shall they with Fain words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time Ling erth not and their damnation slumbereth not for if God spared not the angels that sin but cast them down to Hell and delivered them into chains of Darkness to be reserved under judgment and spared not the old world but saved Noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of ungodly I want you to to notice there in verse one again it says even as it was false prophets false teachers he says they will bring IND damnable heresies and many shall follow their pernicious ways I want to go to 1 Corinthians 11 verses 17-9 now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not that you come together not not for the better but for the worse for first of all when you come together in the church I hear there be divisions among you and I partly believe it for there must also for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you now that may be a little bit hard hard to understand in the King James version so I took the revised Standard Version and let me read from there but in the following instructions I do not commend you because when you come together it's not for the better but for the worse for in the first place when you assemble as a church I hear that there there are divisions among you and I partly believe it for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized amen I am titling my sermon this morning turning from the truth unto fables and I want to take a subject this morning as the damnable heresies among the message now I've told you the deception is not going to come outside amen but it'll be so close the Bible says it'll deceive the very elect if it were possible but for the elect's sake he'll shorten the days otherwise it would be no flesh saved imagine that it would get that bad that no one would be saved but I thank God that he's shortening the days amen amen now as you all know I've been preaching on some subjects for the past several weeks and uh such as trying the spirits within the message calling them eles Apostles and are not and found them to be liars and uh I must say it's caused quite a stir among some of those within the message and the prophet of God says when you throw a rock into amongst a pack of dogs you know the one that gets hit is the one who yells that's right you understand okay so some of my sermons have really exposed the devil Lord that's right I'm here to tell you truth not to the Apostle Paul said look should I try to be the friend of every man or do I keep my friendship with Christ amen amen amen so just as the message of the hour exposed the nickan spirit working among Believers and expose a Jezebel spirit that lies in organized religion and if we are not prayed up and if we are not using disc serment of spirit you could be easily taken over by a spirit and the prophet said if a spirit like that ever gets on you you'll absolutely believe it he says I went to those people and he says tried to tell them from the Bible he said they wouldn't believe it it should are anointed with a wrong spirit amen because a Christlike spirit is teachable that's right amen amen it's correctable you will say that's why you're here you're saying hey correct me Lord if there's something in my life that's not like you correct me Father here's the Judgment judgment begins at the house of God now I realize I speak to an invisible audience also and I want to share with you just for a moment because it really blessed me this was sent on July 17th dear brother Ron Peterson greetings from your invisible audience I just wanted to take the time to tell you how much my family and I have enjoying your services it's been over a year now since we began streaming live and have been tremendously blessed I apologize for not communicating and until now and from the song leaders musicians Ministry in the church we have felt so much at home even tuning in since before the beginning of 2023 i' had actually never heard of brother Ron Peterson I'm assuming this is because I'm from the south and I've never really visited Church from the western side of the United States because of the distance I had such a wonderful time going back in the archives and listening to quite a few sermons that really help explain the things going on in a message concerning the five-fold ministry it helped to clear up a lot of questions I had I appreciate you taking the time to go over these things and even recently touching on them again I like to be on Solid Ground about such important things then she said um she about enjoying and she says thank you we will continue to tune in to your services and pray for all of you may the Lord bless you greatly for all your service and Him Sister Rebecca Addison God bless you Sister Rebecca if you are listening I have never met you that I know of personally but thank you I realize that God will hold me respons responsible because there is also an invisible audience there is people um that I have never met that tune in and listen to these services and so I say God bless her richly so now we know that according to the Book of Matthew in Matthew 24 as you want to throw the scripture up there and except those days be short and there should be no flesh saved but for the Le say those days shall be shortened but if any man shall say to you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false cries false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect now I said it's not going to be somebody with a Cardinal hat or something like that in denomination it's going to be some body that claims to be within truth okay so the Antichrist Spirit has mixed itself brother brm said watch the two seeds watch the two trees the tree of knowledge and the Tree of Life in Genesis and how that one one Springs up another one is there look through the parable of the swer of good seed and there was a swer of seed and it was likened unto God and he SED good seed and he seed it into the highways and the byways and in good ground and on the the side of the road and he says but while men slept there came another one who SED his seed and at the same time in the same field at the same hour there was springing up two different kind of seed do you understand that and the angel said wherewith did the tears come do you want us to go and gather up the tears take them up and cast them away he said no leave them until the end time I want you to know that we're being raised up right now among uh multi miixed seed in a field right now and they're both coming to fruition why this is the time of maturing this is the time when the fruit is ripening on top of the tree somebody say Amen to that we are no longer babes tossed about from every winded Doctrine but strong meat belongs to those who are of full age hallelujah amen amen it happened from The Book of Genesis through Exodus during the time of Moses in the time of Christ it has happened in every one of the church ages and it's happening the same way today in Revelations 2: 18-22 and under the angel of the church notice it says unto the angel of the church somebody say church church we know Church means called out ones unto the angel of the Church of thyra write these things saith the Son of God who hath eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass and I Know Thy works and charity and and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first not with standing I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel with call which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce yes my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and I gave her space to repent for her fornication and she repented not behold I will cast her into a bed and them that command adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds the Bible calls this also the depths of Satan the prophet showed us different things how the enemy is coming in and how he's mixed he seed he's put different things and opinions he started in the Book of Genesis and said Thou shalt not die because Eve said we can eat of every tree except for the tree of knowledge because the day you eat thereof is the day you die is that right that's what God Said but Satan said oh surely you'll not die you see all he's got to do is Twist the word he just got to take one word out of it and he changes the whole picture he seduced her with words first and then the natural took place the prophet told us things as innocent as Christmas and Easter is nothing but Pagan idolatry yeah Christianity versus idolatry go are are you listening same tapes I'm listening to and you think it's okay put a little Christmas tree some kind of pagan Idol up in your home and bow down to worship and throw tinsel on it it's pagan what part of Jezebel religion do you want to say it's okay what part of it do you want now I recently had someone here in our church one of my board members sent me a this YouTube with this guy preaching against me I see preaching he's a false prophet but he went ahead and and everything and and you know I had to listen to what he had to say in the quotes of the Prophet I were actually felt sorry for him because he's deceived he's deceived he's under a spirit of deception and he's deceived and so you know look um I want you all to know I don't surf the Internet to find all the people and all the ministers with in the message and all that because listen boy if you talk about uh a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it's there just type in William brandham what are you going to get you'll get more bad than you will good that's right is that right so I I kind of am in one way honored to be criticized along with the prophet of this hour but these are the kinds of spirits that try to throw dirt on somebody that's anointed of God yeah yeah the Bible says mark them which cause division among you now we all know you got to go through the Hall of critics before you get to the Hall of Fame but nobody wants the critics we just want the fame well let me tell you all of you are going to be criticized on what you believe how you believe it and the way you live it right yeah yeah and those that live Godly in Christ Jesus the Bible says shall suffer persecution if you're not being persecuted if people are not speaking evil of you the Bible says beware when all men speak good of you yeah patronizing you all the time hey you're the best well I tell you what they hated Jesus for the words that he said and he said if they hated me they're going to hate you the same they'll Hate You Without a Cause yeah that's right so let me show you in the sermon actually because my wife's been asking me are you going to continue on with that the discernment of spirit well here brother Brenham in the sermon discernment of spirit here in Phoenix let me read to you what he says here did you notice when David was rejected as king he went out of the city and a little Benjamine a benjamite which is supposed to have been a brother to him should have been sorry because he was rejected but what see he was a crippled man and he drug along there with his crippled condition throwing dirt on David and calling him all kinds of bad names cursing him in the name of the Lord cursed him even called him son of bile and cursing King David in the name of the Lord this little old crippled up benjamite wash the spirit of God and the spirit of the devil working it represents the spiritual crippled of the people today that they would make fun of the true spirit of God in Christ manifesting itself you see whenever you preach the truth you expose the devil and he does not like being exposed now the prophet of God said every Revival brings forth twins twins are lookalikes yes sir there are the ishmaelites who persecuted Isaac who was born first ishmail and when Isaac the son of Promise came along what did he do he hated Isaac he persecuted he said everything he could against Isaac watch that same Spirit okay in the sermon Christ The Mystery of God reveal and they're going to bring a persecution on pretty soon and shut up all the churches you see that and churches like this who is not a denomination they'll use them for a storehouse anything and if any man goes off and offer a prayer for anybody else that don't belong that ecumenical movement will be shot on the spot it's already Lutheran Ministry goes on don't make any difference what they say see that church will stand true in this light she she's already proved it back Yonder and she'll do it again in the Fe of everything it's the word of God and they all the ecumenical movements and everything else will be gone she is going to be there without spot or wrinkle that's right she'll stand there that brother YK as he was speaking this past Wednesday night talked about standing in the Gap tremendous and he said he he was talking about it's going to be her for she will be him right Christ in another form the prophet of God said now there'll be fallen angels yeah he says it'll close the doors of this church what is an angel It's a messenger not all are messengers of God right I want to ask you who closed the doors of brandham Tabernacle who's no longer printing the books who's no longer giving out the tapes why don't you discern Spirits it wasn't the Catholic church that closed Brandon Tabernacle that's right you can say what you want the fact of the matter is Jeffersonville did okay go back there and see what I saw you want to know look for yourself yeah yeah because you know what we're in a spiritual warfare and you understand all of you as message Believers as got the crosshairs on you and on your children and if they can't get you they're going to get your children they're going to throw them into all kinds of stuff and my my daughter was talking to me last night and she says daddy why if we are quote the bride of Christ if we are the elect predestinated seed of God why do we have so many divisions I ask you it is a Biblical question with a Biblical answer because one has got an opinion on this one an opinion on that and they're not saying everything that he said and next thing you know I'm of Paul and I'm of Apollos and I tell you I'm going to ask by way of those who hear this tap including the ministry Brethren stand up and be mature and quit his childishness who who's got the biggest church who's got the greatest following who is the prophet of the hour brother Ram said I'll tell you who the prophet of the hour is it's the Holy [Applause] Ghost amen praise God Christ is the mystery of God revealed now listen Fallen Angels what kind of angels Luther Wesley Catholic Pentecostal yeah who kept not their first estate like the Angels did but fell into organization like Lucifer's main hold at niia what have they done organized a great ecal Association minister to make an image of the Beast is the Bible said and building a Christian economy to close the doors of this church and others like it see Lucifer had his work he say they'll close this church who closed it you discern yourself and I will not waste my time to send to this man my response to his YouTube thing against me I won't waste my time you don't kick at a barking dog leave him alone I'm truly blessed to have this done to me actually do I like it not really to be honest with you sometimes the old flesh man yeah who is this guy let me talk to him we'll have some five-fold Ministry but that's carnal isn't it the Bible says in Matthew 5:9 and 12 blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you persecute you say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake Rejoice me exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven thank you Lord hallu for so persecuted the prophets which were before you oh I am privileged and I am blessed amen beyond measure now let me touch on another subject this morning because it was something that came across in my life as an early Christian when I first came to this message so you kind of bear with me uh as I give a little bit of a wrap up again of my of my testimony as you all know I wasn't raised in a church my parents didn't take us to church Jesus Christ The Name of Jesus Christ was a cuss word in our family we had never gone to church the only time I had ever actually walked into a church was when my sister had gotten married and it was at a church and they had the ceremony because my parents had just Nar it wasn't my father kept saying ah these people these Christians he says look at those going into the church do they look happy I want to ask you how do you look when you go into church are you walking you are not going to sell anybody on what you got unless you're happy about what you got right you ought to have a zip in your step a smile on your face and be happy about what you believe amen I'm happy about what I believe I'm thankful to God that he opened my eyes and gave me understanding in this hour so all of the ones who came into the message at the same time that we did there in California came into the message by listening to tapes and I told you a brother found this at a swap meet and he wanted to buy this tape recorder the old real toore Woolen sack and the guy said okay you can buy it fine $25 I'll take it he said under condition you have to take the tapes I don't want the tapes I just want the recorder no you have to have the tapes it goes along with it I don't want the what's on the tapes he said a preacher he said I really don't want it because this was a backsliding hippie druggy Jew he wanted nothing to do with preaching so anyway the guy said Hey listen come on man you have to buy tapes to record your rock music anyway record over it bing yeah so you know what he did okay yeah I'll take and just in curiosity yeah I wonder what this guy has to say good evening friends I greet you in then Lan this guy hears half a tape man his eyes come open he's so excited he started sharing it we had no idea where do who is we figured that brother brenham's name was Jeff from Indiana because that was on the side of the tapee sermon title and Jeff Indiana short for Jeffersonville well let me tell you we bunch of druggies hippies loudan Misfits City Slickers Surfers hey man none of us were church goers and we start hearing these tapes and let me tell you even as I told my wife this was we had been boyfriend and girlfriend and I had gotten away from the things of the Lord and she saidif you're not going to be a Christian I want nothing to do with you good for you Sisters You Learn by a mother like that in Christ so later I came to the message I said Sandy come over here I believe we found a prophet well she didn't hear anything that she just wanted to know what what what changed me so man we put on the tape and and we just bowed our heads and when brother Bram said let's pray we prayed and I'm saying oh God open her eyes and by the end of the tape I didn't have to say now you listen to me you know what that's it it's all it took because my sheep hear my voice and the stranger they won't fellow follow let me tell you there's something about this voice at the end time but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery of God would be finished thank you Lord amen yes sir we all started gathering together to listen to tapes we were part of those tape group in a home it's true one of the reasons was nobody had any money there was only one guy with a tape recorder and player and there was very few tapes so we said hey will you share what you got yeah so we all sat together and listen to these tapes and let me tell you there was such a desire listen we don't know what's going to come on the next tape LGH haired hippies brother brand said you know what kind of spirit is on him man with long hair is perverted I'm sitting there with my long hair yeah I'm going why did he have to say that and sheep desire to have Fellowship don't they brother Ram said you get out on your own he said that little sheep that wanders off by itself is just ready for the devil to come some old wolf to come along and get a hold of you you need Fellowship sheep must Fellowship together and sheep need a Shepherd we prayed ask God to teach us what we needed to learn we didn't know man I tell you all we did was just we were so sincere just to hear the word of God we and then one day um they had we found a tape list in one of the the boxes at tapes it was from Fred sofman at Tucson and man as a young boy there was a tape there they said we got to get this tape this tape here is definitely the one we got to get it's called choosing a bride so yeah we're excited here's a bunch of young men in the message just come to it just as fresh as you could yeah oh yeah and and you know brother Bram said now uh I had a friend of mine who who raised cattle and he says now you better look that little heer in the eye and if she got that wild and we're laughing listen to this Kentucky hillbilly that's you know because he he says I'm a Kentucky hillbilly look at his education look at the way he describes things you better look that little heer in the eye she got that wild stare don't you never buy her she'll never be a mama to her Cals and man we're laughing then gets to the place about choosing a bride and at the end oh Capernaum o Capernaum thou city which calleth itself the City of Angels I was born in Los Angeles my family lived in Los Angeles I'm from Los Angeles brother Mike sister paty he was there when brother brandham preached choosing a bride we've got witnesses said I was there within weeks all of those we heard the tapate get out of California we left our jobs our educations our houses and everything that we had we sold it all and the first ones to leave was Ezra's parents Ezra Paige Mark and an Paige they were the first one in our group they just they're gone it was a mass Exodus out of California where do we go what do we do we don't know we just go the group split up into two groups David McGary took his little group up to to Montana to a place called Mazula and there was a little uh family there called the vanoi family Rodney vanoi any of you know Rodney vanoi yeah stepen Julie yeah rodne eoi and here Brother David he brings his little group up there and our little group we just we went over and we were in Oregon in the wamt valley and here we are we're just you know and so the only thing we know to do is to get together and play the tapes so we went there in the first couple uh weeks that we were up there in fact I had testified to Sandy I said we're leaving California well where are you going and I said I don't know I think maybe up towards Oregon and so she with her girlfriend they went and left and they moved up to Oregon they moved into one of the families that had left with us but as the time goes on guess what we started getting more spiritual or God starts Opening Our Eyes praise the lord we start seeing and what brother Brenham said we did hey man if he said the Way Up Is Down we got rid of our bellbottom pants and of our hippie tie dye and we got rid of all of that stuff in fact we were thinking that if the Way Up Is Down let's should we brush our teeth and comb our hair cuz that's vanity I mean when you're sincere it's like Lord okay someone even told us okay it came along there was somebody I don't know how but somebody found out that somebody in the area believ the message and he contacted us and guess what oh man this guy was so spiritual he said hey take off your shoes take off your Sho yeah your sock take them off I I'll show you what tribe of Israel you're from oh man I took my shoe off and look you're from the tribe of Judah how do you know cuz the the toe next to the big one is longer than the big one so therefore that's Judah man I walked around without shoes for a week Judah right there such nonsense and we begin man hey people starts praying and fasting and seeking God what do we do because the more we hear the tapes the more we hear you need to have a home Church you need to have a pastor you need to quit going from Pillar To Post you need to have somewhere you take your kids put them in Sunday school is that right right amen I even had a a dive watch 1967 my parents bought me a a a a a dive watch and guess what it said guaranteed to 666 feet one of the brothers looked at that and he said Mark of the Beast man I don't want no mark of the beast it's on your watch so I got rid of it quit wearing the mark of the bees man and then I got me a pocket watch and then I I I took the twine put it together and put it into my pocket and we're listening to a tape one time and so I took the back of the pocket watch and I put three crosses on there I put Hebrews 13 and8 same yesterday today and forever and I it it's it's real good I thought about bringing it today uh to show you I still have the original watch and I showed one of the the elders who was two weeks older in the message to me therefore he was my Elder and so I showed him and he looked at that wow that's That's Heavy idolatry man oh man I can't win for losing you ever seen a belt buckle like that oh yeah huh this is one of The Originals brother Mike you may have one first time I ever saw that was on Brother Floyd Patterson he came up because you know what um it says Malachi 4:5 Luke 1730 Revelations 10:7 that's got the eagle on it here he was Brother Floyd and so he was standing in front of this oil heater and he had this belt buckle here I said man can I look at your belt buckle wow yeah anyway it's not the belt book that makes you a Believer okay and neither is it that you got 666 on your watch makes you a mark of the beast I mean but you see you get so spiritual everything means everything you know good grief so we started getting so spiritual man one of the brothers is is hey you had a dream last night come here tell me your dream I'll tell you the interpretation man we could we stood in line waiting for can't wait to tell you my dream dream hey man had well I'll tell you what that dream means oh my goodness you just get so far out so very quickly L look this one is in the days of the voice of the seventh angel I got one that Austin dubsky got me man huh it's not Revelations 10:7 what is it 108 yeah I am official because Austin gave me Revelations 10 8-10 yeah or 11 whatever it is now now I'm not trying to be funny on some of this stuff because I'm gonna get real serious here now I'm GNA screw this down real good okay so that you understand brother BR said Drive the nail and then clinch it okay so we came across all the time listening to tapes you ought to have a home Church you got to have somewhere you pay your tithe and your offering you got to have somewhere that you have a pastor to watch over you a live five-fold Ministry we become subject to a live Ministry the Bible says in Hebrews 10: 23- 2 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is it was already in that day as the manner of some is huh but exhorting one another and so much more as you see that day approaching we kept reading about preachers and pastors and having a home church and we needed will lead your to ship so one day I asked a couple of the elders why don't we have a church let mean you know what this is what they said That's Heavy brother you got a Catholic Spirit on you like some altar boy we need to pray to get you delivered to this Catholic spirit because we're the church you see it ain't no bill building we're the church we're the called out one wow man I I went from thinking we ought to go to church and that's what the prophet said but now I'm cutting down so the next day you know what they said God told us to not share with you anything spiritual anymore you can't understand it so I was excommunicated from the group you know what that feels like we didn't know anybody in the message there was it was just us right several families that's all we knew in the message and boy I tell you what when somebody says we're not going to share with you anything any more spiritual but God was doing it for a purpose thank you Lord because I was telling them say what the prophet have said why are we not doing what he said so I was already as a young boy Discerning spirit okay have you ever met somebody let me just ask you you ever met somebody that say they're a Christian or there a message believer and their Spirit does not bear witness with yours you feel it's them and you you ever felt that I want to ask you what are you Discerning brother Brenham has them coming up during the time of the discernment they walk the angel was to the right come through here like this and brother brandham says now come close he says that won't hurt you that's his presence he says now I know you're a Christian because you have that welcoming Spirit oh God help me to have the right spirit amen I'd rather have the right Spirit and the wrong Doctrine that's what he said I'd rather have the wrong Doctrine and the right spirit because the right spirit is teachable amen so remember now I typed this sermon last night before a brother sent me what about what I'm about to read you on some stuff some because some people think that brother Brenham did not believe in going to church and they still believe that okay forsake not the assembling of yourselves together now so 1964 in questions and answers watch this here brotherr and put it up there so everybody can read it brother Brenham should we go to other churches even when they disagree with you sure yep Jesus did when they disagreed with him go ahead we notice here should we go to another church that disagrees with you sure I'm not the only Pebble on the beach you know there's just other Godly men everywhere I hope I'm one of them amen a group in Arizona amazing he Arizona the Arizona's Troublemaker a group in Arizona but there's a Lex seed there too so a group in Arizona call my attention to that a ministerial group said the only thing we have against you brother brandom one of the things the people that comes out here with you we can't get them to go to church anywhere said they got children and everything and they won't go to church now I know they put pressure on you and want you to join but you don't have to join just put them kids in Sunday School somewhere and you go to church don't sit at home go fishing hunting and things like that on Sunday you say well I'm not a legalist you'd better be in the manner after that for a while dishonoring the resurrection of Christ you go to church somewhere if I went to a certain church I know there's only one thing them people ever said that I believe they said that g uh they believe Jesus was the son of God said that I doubt it but I would go to hear them say that maybe you say well that this church maybe the next church maybe something like the Baptist yeah I believe that you have to have an experience I'll go see and he goes on I'm going to go to the next quote paragraph 2113 CU I'm I'm I don't want to take too much time just reading and if an assembly Minister happens to pick up this tape I want to tell you when was I ever against the Assembly of God men or any other man why is that when your own headquarters admits I have sent to you 3/4 of a million of my children that I have begotten to Christ 750,000 of brother brenham's converts to Christ where did he send him Assembly of God let him keep reading or I will how am I against the Assembly of God why why am I Against the Oneness I'm not against no Oneness Assembly of God Church God or no man I'm against every system that separates man like I've sent to the assemblies by their own count three4 of a million of my own children if they're so bad why would I do that why I think the best there is in the land to send them there either the Oneness some the Pentecostal belief because they believe in Divine Healing they believe in Supernatural they believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the best I can't bring them all right here they're all over the world I got friends all over the world children I've begotten to Christ I'll send them to the best well why would I send them there then I would be a hypocrite to send my own children to death far be it from me no sir see two paragraph 25 if you can't go if you can't go here at the Tabernacle get some church somewhere go to do it yeah sure you go to church wherever you go to church door open you take off as hard as you can go if they don't believe that now you don't have to predate don't join them don't join any of them churches just go to them fellowship with them how do you know it's not the Lord and he said he'd make everything work together for the good and maybe there's a soul in there ought to be saved and you can Shine the Light to them go on down don't go arrogant go sweet and the people begin to say that's such a Christian woman and so on now let me address myself to the tape boys right now so you tape boys are listening you listen real careful sir cuz now I'm on your case and any of you ever typed in the tape boys in the message of the hour T type it in 25 quotes and the vast majority of the tape boys were Leo Mercer and Jean go did anybody know Leo Mercer and Jean go let me see your hand raise your hand if you did did you know him yes yeah sister Linda yeah brother Steve yeah I knew Jean Jean was a buddy of mine we spent time hunting together I never met Leo you tape boys I want to ask you who split the Tabernacle and took three4 of brandham Tabernacle and had a move to an area called Prescott Arizona and with the admission of those that followed Leo and Jean because they were Joshua and Caleb because brother Brenham was Moses and so you know what Moses saw into the promised land but it's not going to place you there we are Joshua and Caleb so you follow us and they got those Believers to burn their tapes and books of brother Brenham before they left you see what deception okay now they're not the only ones we got so many joshuas and calebs and Prophets of the hour and igh day Messengers we got all kinds and they're dividing the little I want you to understand a nickelonit divides and Conquer if I can get you split up if I can divide you if I can get you all staying home if I can get you there and it's just a Catholic Spirit it used to be that you could go light a candle in the Catholic church and say a prayer right if you was sincere God would hear you pray to St Christopher now you just press play you don't you don't have to pray you don't have to seek the mind of God you see what I'm saying it's just press play and he'll do your religious works for you and you sit home and you're not under a live five-fold Ministry you're just sitting there and you're not subject to nobody you understand CU nobody's making you accountable CU there is no accountability to those who stay home and press play but there is when you go to a church and you're under a five-fold Ministry and there is a ministry that's preaching and by the Discerning of the word by the spirit he is preaching and all of a sudden he's on your case how many of you can say it's happened to me in church the minister preaching and it had an effect he was right on me and nobody told him the spirit told him so 25 quotes on the tape boys most of them are about Leo Mercer and Jean gold but here is one but there must have been some tape boys slipped in somewhere to that predestinated seat slipped over to her house speaking of Rahab played some tapes and she made her own house at church to receive the message okay she made her house a church do you catch it you're supposed to be at home that's your church wait just a second he keeps reading but one little heart there must have been some tape boys slipped in there and played some tapes the predestinated seed caught it and B believed it somehow anyhow they got in there for a message they had church that night in her house she used her house for a church to receive the message listen I come through that yes sir I want to ask you she received two Messengers there wasn't a cassette that walked in there there wasn't a real toore there wasn't a book they had two Messengers what were they packing message because Joshua the destruction Angel is ready to come and take Jericho and she says you Messengers and you know this is amazing thing here's one of those questions I have what in the world are you two Messengers sitting in a in a harlot's house of every place that you go why there well God will answer that when we get over there but the only I can say she was predestinated to hear it and she might have been in a horrible condition come on now you understand she might have been all kinds of horrible things in her life but when those two Messengers carrying the Ark of the Lord over their hearts brother ramam said he never he never called in uh Mechanical Devices that's right to preach the gospel he called men God called men somebody say Amen to that right so let me address the tape boys as I told you just hang on right now and I'm I'm I'm about halfway so amen 1965 brother Brandon preaches a sermon trying to do God a service without it being according to his will I think I'm so misunderstood and don't know why some people think I don't even believe in people going to church that's a million miles from the truth we must assemble ourselves together and that much more as we see the day approaching we must come together in unity if I lived in a city and they had nothing there but well some church I don't want to call any name but just any church they only believe one thing that Jesus was divine and the rest of it was wrong I go to that church if I can't get a whole loaf of bread I'll take a slice see I'll go listen Worship the Lord and show him I'm doing my part I want him to know I'm alive I want everybody to know what site I'm on I assemble with Christians and they worship and serve the and serve the Lord he said but watch now he says they live off the name of Christianity but they bear the wrong kind of fruit has denominational fruit they said a thing and they living right off of it living off the very life it's what I was trying to say last night that Spirit can be baptized into that spirit and still not be a Christian see you're living right off of the same life but the fruits you bear tells what you are that's right they can do all the signs pray for the sick heal the sick open eyes cast out devils and all these things right off from the same life that's there but it's still a lemon now so a brother sent me this this morning comes from the voice of God website honestly I think in my whole Christian Life I have not gone to voice of God website maybe three times because voice of God is not my absolute it's not my Mecca I'm not looking to the brandom family as my absolute okay so here it is have you guys you want to see you know what this is up here it's the countdown how soon we're having church and I want all of you at 12:00 Jeffersonville to come in and to listen to God's voice for this hour and I believe that's God's voice I do okay but it's the stuff that is being propagated right now I'm against I'm going to tell you and I may make some even be upset with me here so here it is this is a I'm quoting Joseph brandham right now dear hidden Mana eaters God sent his seventh angel Messenger to lead his bride not another man not a group of man but one man for the message and his messenger are the same God's word needs no interpretation he spoke it to his bride through human lips and we all believe just how he said it I say say all that the tapes say yesen don't take your selective quotes go from 47 65 we must be careful today what voice is leading us and what it's telling it it is telling us our very Eternal destination depends on that very decision so we must decide what voice is the most important voice we must hear what voice has been Vindicated by God what voice has thus sayith the Lord it can't be my voice my words my Doctrine but it must be the word thank you Joseph it must be the word amen not his words you understand not his voice but the word so he's even having to testify it's the word because the word of God is our absolute do you understand it that's the umum Thum today he says you want to know he says hey if a man is telling you the truth or not put it to God's arum Thumb from Genesis to Revelation if it don't light up it's false prophet right okay that's our absolute the Bible does it tell us that he will raise up the five-fold ministry to lead us in the end we can clearly see in the word they have their place very important place but does that the word say anywhere capital letters they will be the ones to have the most important voice that what we must here to be the bride do you do you understand what he's saying Prophet told us here there are so many men to rise up in the last days that will try to do God a service without being his will see he said his perfect will is and always has been to hear and believe his Vindicated prophet's voice for it it and it alone has thus saith oh Lord that's why he sent his Angel why he chose him he had it recorded it's spiritual food in due season hidden Mana to his bride seven out of The Seven Ages men esteem their word above mine you have to ask yourself that is this not happening Among Us right now don't play tapes in church but you must hear your pastor just play the tapes in your home he's quoting that Joseph said that they don't play place his voice on tape as the most important voice but their voice they're pointing the people to themselves and importance of their Ministry their calling to bring the word to the uh to lead the bride but the bride cannot stand for it they will not accept it they will not uh do it they will not compromise on it it's the voice of God or nothing else that's what de bride says now Paul said follow me as I follow thank you follow the word he said for I have taught you day and night for three years that after my departing shall come in Grievous wolves and they're not going to spare the flock going to eat you up amen I don't deny or question but some of the most influential ministers and the fivefold ministry in their rank says it's not the voice of God it's just the voice of William brandham others say the days of a oneman messes message are over and this message isn't the absolute is that who is leading you I want to ask you do you tape boys who are you leading what are you pointing him to say what he said yes don't take your little selective quote and say here you know and you know what yeah do do I do I say that there are not ministers that have preached for years had churches and big conventions and now they've left the message do I say that's not true no it's true it's true I can't deny that there's a there's quite a few that's left the message does that bother me no it doesn't the Bible says the end shall not come except be the a falling away first a great Falling Away amen so I want to ask you you guys know my M manner of speech you know what I teach I want to ask you do we play tapes in this church I've been really wanting to go back we haden't played it in a couple in several months but I want to do it I want to have a tape night I believe in it why do you think I put the quotes up there on the board for you so you know where he said it I don't see sit there and act like well I tell you what prophet God said you believe what this and then I add to it and take away from it no you go and the best thing for you to do is go back and listen to the tape yourself is that right all the way listen to all that he said not just a portion of it the question on people's mind today who did God choose to lead his bride the tapes or the five-fold ministry will the ministry perfect the bride will the ministry guide the bride according to God's word that has never been his way there are so many men today that have said they followed this message for years and years but they're now placing their ministry as the most important voice that you must hear but I want to ask you I'm I'm asking you you guys know me do I tell you that we shouldn't listen to tapes do we play tapes here even in this church and we study the message yes sir yeah just like we do the word of God okay because we want to rightly divide the word of God because God's going to hold me accountable and the thing that I like about when you go home and you listen to the tape and then you hear me preach and if I'm saying the same thing he said you're going to Amen brother Ron why I read that last night I heard that last night Amen brother preach it that's a true absolutely now which ministry will you follow which ministry will you place your Eternal destination on they say they're a call of God to preach the message I don't deny or question that some of these most influential ministers in the five-fold ministry ranks say it's not the voice of God it's the voice of William Brandon now here's here's where when I went to work for Brother Joseph he inherited a work that we were already doing spoken word Publications first office outside of Jeffersonville anywhere in the world and Sandy and I were asked by Brother Floyd Patterson who when Roy borders died at spoken word Publications he made Brother Floyd publisher and Brother Floyd asked my wife and I if we would go to Europe and we would help distribute the tapes and books of brother Brenham throughout Europe so we did then about 1986 or so there about we got there in 1984 uh Brother Joseph wanted complete control I want all of the printing operation and everything Fred sofman went ahead and gave him all of duplicating of the tapes and so now he inherited a work that we're already doing so he and brother Billy Paul come over to Europe and I knew them both I knew them by name they knew me by name but we didn't know one another on a real personal basis and so they came over and so they inherited a work and they took and they changed the name from spoken word Publications to voice of God Recordings which is still going today I should say it's a it's a building but they're not printing they're not duplicating what are they doing go there I went to the front door Daniel Andy says go up and it says it's closed due to remodeling you got to be kidding me I go up and I want to take a picture CU it's on a thing about this big 8 and half by 11 closed due to remont so I'm walking up to the front door to take a picture real close of it at the front door of voice of God Recordings and the door opens G I didn't know it's kind of a a mirror and I can't look through it oh brother Ron Peterson yes oh yeah you were the voice of God oh yeah you were from Germany yeah yeah oh my you know the Wizard of Oz excuse me I want to make fun of that but yes and and and here brother Daniel and sister Shannon are with us and and everything and and so finally he says well can we come into the forier oh yes yes come into the for so we go in there and they've got brother Brown's Pulpit the old Pulpit the one that was in the the flood that remember okay and uh no just look just look I don't want you to go behind it I don't want you to touch it it's just there this a you know hey that's fine listen I I don't need to touch it I don't need to get behind it do you do you see I mean see and then later we went to brandham Tabernacle I didn't ask brother Daniel take us to brandom Tabernacle but we were going by I went by we went by I wanted to see brother Billy Paul's grave because he's buried near brother Brenham and I wanted to see his gravestone we drove by I wanted to pay my respects because I love brother Billy but when he and Brother Joseph came to our office and he asked me to go to work for him I said okay I will but I said before I do I said I want to ask you Brother Joseph what do you believe about what your daddy said about you well brother Ron honestly I don't understand what daddy said about me on and on and I said if I'm going to work for you I want you to know how I see it because you know there's all these things you know brother R A Vision he's going to have a son he's going to be the prophet of and all this stuff I said okay I said according to scripture now I got Brother Joseph and brother Billy Paul sitting right I said according to scripture there's three kinds of prophets one is a major prophet and that's to an age and there can and will be other Minor Prophets right but there will be a major prophet to the louia and age and guess what he's already come I've already filled out brandom that hey your daddy got that spot so you can't be a major prophet is that right and the Bible says or excuse me the prophet of the hour tells us that a new testament preacher is a prophet yes so I said Joseph are you a you a preacher he rolls his eyes he said I'd have to get rid of half of my toys now I'm je hey now what I'm I'm saying I said with Joseph there so if he hears this he knows I'm telling the truth he knows I've never gone after them I love those men I said but I'm going to tell you just how I feel I said then the third one is a prophet like an un agabus you know what uh that is a man with a gift of Prophecy and he may only anoint him one or two times in his whole life to give a word right we're talking the book of Acts agabus so said you're not a major prophet you're you tell me you're not a preacher and you know what if Brother Joseph started preaching right now most of the people wouldn't know what to do with it you know why because he's been against preachers so he's in a real quandry like well should we have a church should we have a building should we get all the people together do you see when what I'm saying oh yeah I brother and and so again I told you I know and Sandy bear with me she knows sometimes I get a little rough most of all the ministry today say you should not listen to the voice of God's angel in the church only in your homes brother renham never said play tapes in church well first off that's not what we believe and another thing playing tapes never replace going to church somebody say Amen no I want you to listen to those tapes cuz that's God's voice to this age but let me throw a curveball to you the seventh angel is not the final voice there's one that comes after him right Revelations 10:8 but take the book and eat it because thou must prophesy who's the final voice to the final Age The Bride let me throw you another quote brother Ram said will the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the coming of the Lord yep sure uhhuh it's going on right now but it'll ever be so humble most people will Overlook it amen wake up people listen what these ministers are telling you these quotes are using to place their Ministry before the prophets How can any Minister be more important than to hear God's Vindicated voice that's proven that's has been proven and Vindicated that it's thus theth see I want to ask you see God never ordained mechanical devices to preach the gospel okay true ministry will tell you that there is nothing more important than hearing the word of God from the voice of God on tape they can preach teach or whatever they called to do but they must Place God's voice first but they're not doing it they're placing their Ministry first their actions prove well I want to ask you who closed the Tabernacle who has told all of the min to quit preaching who has said the only ones that should preach are the ones that will press play who said it it's okay it's okay last couple things here now if you all want to go you can go to today's voice of God recording and read the whole transcript of what Joseph is telling you you can read the whole thing you can discern it yourself ask yourself if brother Brandon was here today in flesh would he not have all the bride hook up to hear him all at the same time I want to ask you when brother Bren was here now I had a brother that went to my church in Silsby Texas his name was Bill Watkins Bill Watkins was under the ministry of Perry green and Perry green because Bill Watkins worked for mael which was the telephone company there in Texas he said hey you know you're a good technician will you divine U devise us a telephone hookup that everybody can call in from around wherever Arizona California he you know how brother Bram greets everybody but so Bill Watkins said yeah it's simple he took a bunch of old telephones put them together made a board gave it to Perry green Perry green gave it to brother brandham and they put it in the back room and so yes this morning God bless you I B I greet the church in in Phoenix the church up in Prescott those in Nevada or wherever he's just going on and on now I want to ask you see brother brandham do you think that he would would just say I want all of you to go and to just hear me on every Sunday he says if you have a home Church go to your home Church okay he would tell you that but you see so but what about the main thing are they using the quotes to tell you to hear God's Prophet is what you must do or their Ministry well I want to ask you as I got just two two quotes left here brother brandham said the final voice is not Revelations 10:7 he said the final voice is the bride it's going to be five-fold Ministry Ephesians 4 so what would you do with somebody that says I don't believe in Ephesians 4 would you discern the spirit sure would you judge it according to the word who denies the five-fold ministry cannot be of God you judge it because it's according to the word right so he says this is his last sentence here and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and and perform his Works Hallelujah do you see it hey wait a second musicians if you come I want to I want to ask you this question those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord they'll be his body and be his voice wait a second you just said there's only one voice you're denying the very thing of what he said be his voice and perform his Works Hallelujah do you see it now one last scripture that I wish to share with you is found in 1 Timothy 4 and7 1-7 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith what is Faith Revelation giving heed to seducing Spirits doctrines of devils speaking lies and hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron forbidding to marry commanding to abstain from Meats which God had created to receive with Thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth for every creature of God is good nothing to be re refused if is is received with Thanksgiving for it is Sanctified by the word of God in prayer and if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good Doctrine whereinto thou has attained but refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ all I do is put you in remembrance Timothy all he did was put him in remembrance of what Paul said now some of these things that I say here today and I'm you know I I love Brother Joseph I do I spent days with them traveling together go on bicycle rides go on walks in the forest with he and his wife go to his house for dinner I always wanted to see the inside of brother brenham's home i' never asked always went by the outside of the home there there's this seven over the doorway you can see it looks like it's seven kind of slanted the little roof but he said brother Ron why don't you and Sandy come and have dinner with us tonight yeah sure we went and had dinner the end of the story is this he said brother Ron I've never had anyone this is about 1986 he says I've never had anyone into my home for dinner I said Joseph you're kidding you've never had anyone over for Fellowship then I asked that multi-million dollar question why did you have Sandy and I why I'll never forget what he said cuz he said you treat me normal I bought him a gift one day in Rome we're in downtown Rome we were traveling together I bought him a gift told him I'll meet him downstairs at a certain time I went out and bought a gift he went out and bought his gift we came downstairs at the same time we both had a gift in our hands and he goes like this he puts it behind him I put mine behind him I said Joseph I said I didn't go and I didn't go into my room and rest I bought you a gift and I said Hey Joe I got you a gift because I like you not because your name's [Music] brandom man the floodgates he said nobody's ever bought me a gift cuz they like me he says and they always say if you want to be good to me brother Brenham if you want to be good to me be good to my family he said nobody just gives me a gift for being me I said I love you Joe I love you for being you I accept you for being [Music] you do you know how hard it was would have been to be raised up in the family of brother [Music] Brandon and seen the fanatical issues and all of the things I told him I said Brother Joseph you're lucky to be in your right [Music] mind that's why I have a heart for Him and if Joseph if you hear this you know that to be the truth son you know when I disagreed it was you and I disagreeing it wasn't and I don't shoot at Jeffersonville that's not my intent this morning but something has changed one of the most divisive divisions within the message was a booklet that you all probably have in your home it's called here I stand and separated the tapes from the ministry and said that anybody that that prints a book it's stolen bread if it's not printed in Jeffersonville if the tapes are not duplicated in Jeffersonville they're not anointed so again I have the voice of God office so I I took a tape from Harold hilderbrandt and I took one that Brother Joseph sent me that was from voice of God in Jeffersonville I put it in the cassette player and I said okay all right you're spiritual tell me which one's anointed he said well that's not fair well stop quick playing this spiritual nonsense you just said it's not anointed you're spiritual tell me which one's anointed he said that's not fair the anointing is on The Voice I said you got that right I said I don't care who duplicates it or where it's duplicated it in the days of the voice of the seventh angel see what I'm saying Saints well we've we've had this change now and it's coming coming real strong right now from Jeffersonville who's got the ministry that's going to lead the bride is it the prophet is it fivefold Ministry let me tell you you know what it is it's the Holy Spirit keeping you away from all of the fanaticism and this side and that side it's not all the five-fold ministry it's not all the tapes it's right in the middle of the road and I stand for that and you all know you that have been with me for a long time Brother Andy Menard what do I stand for what if I give my life I've never propagated my own Ministry I point all of you to one thing yes you listen to that Prophet amen but don't you stay home you go to church it don't have to be my church you go somewhere get under a pastor who's ordained of God to watch over you as a Shepherd does his sheep I hope you all understand and you you take it from me this morning because I'm not here trying to go after somebody no it's a spirit it's happening that right now among the message Believers and there's heresies damnable heresies brother brandham said they started baptizing in my [Music] name he said I'm going to quit to Ministry it's done over he said I thought it was my enemy he said you know what some of my best friends he said you know what I'd rather meet God as a quitter than as a false prophet you know what I love about this ministry he pointed me to Jesus Christ and that's why I love him with a fervency the way that I do you know Ted you're you're sitting here for the first time it's probably all strange to you but one thing I want you to know these people here the reason we do and act and is because we love Jesus Christ amen you know what we are oddballs we're different and I don't mind telling all of you I am an I'm an [Music] oddball I've unburdened my heart this morning is it okay that you will say brother Ron I'm praying for you amen I'm praying for you I tell me the truth brother Ron just don't sugarcoat it tell me the truth amen let's stand together brother Mark I just want to please
