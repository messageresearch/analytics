[50:59] we recognize who we are Lord
[51:02] and we can live the life that you worthy
[51:05] of the Gospel of God once again Lord we
[51:08] humble ourselves into thy presence
[51:11] knowing Lord that without you we can't
[51:14] do anything that's right so we're so
[51:16] thankful and grateful Lord that once
[51:20] again we come before your throne
[51:23] expecting Lord that you will come and
[51:25] Minister once again into our needs
[51:28] Lord You're so mindful
[51:31] Lord of our needs Lord then thank you we
[51:35] just
[51:36] pray that you will once again manifest
[51:41] your faithfulness in our me Lord and so
[51:45] we want to
[51:47] remember the PS and family Lord that may
[51:50] just give peace and comfort Lord in this
[51:54] time the need Lord
[51:58] so once again we commit the service into
[52:01] thy presence in Jesus wonderful name
[52:05] amen amen amen can we say praise to the
[52:07] Lord this morning praise the Lord amen
[52:11] just like what David said I I'm so glad
[52:13] when they said unto me let us go into
[52:14] the house of the Lord amen and before we
[52:17] go to the word this morning I would like
[52:19] to say thank you to all who gave their
[52:23] appreciation card last Sunday and
[52:26] haven't got a chance to say thank you
[52:28] last Wednesday because I was not here so
[52:32] thank you very much for all those who
[52:34] gave their cards and just a word of
[52:37] encouragement is enough for us to
[52:39] continue to give us the inspiration amen
[52:43] amen it's hard to stand in the
[52:45] Pulpit sometimes we you we don't when
[52:48] you don't know if they are blessed or
[52:50] not but just one word is
[52:54] enough thank you Lord uh to know
[52:58] that we are on the same page amen
[53:03] amen so I would like to
[53:07] uh take this time just a little thought
[53:10] and a simple thought this morning and I
[53:13] would like to title this sermon uh he
[53:16] carth for you thank you Lord maybe this
[53:19] will not be the sermon that you expect
[53:22] for me to preach that you can jam and
[53:25] Shout or so is just a simple thought
[53:27] this
[53:28] morning and uh I believe that whatever
[53:32] things that God put in our heart as a
[53:34] minister God somebody may need it amen
[53:38] even though how simple it is that's true
[53:41] amen because we know that we are living
[53:43] in the Lan age although God sent a
[53:46] messenger in our day to come out of this
[53:50] Lan age which is miserable and naked and
[53:55] they don't know it and
[53:57] lukewarmness although we heard the voice
[53:59] and we come out from the system but we
[54:02] can still be affected by that system
[54:04] that's right just like Sarah and Abraham
[54:07] they come out amen they they're not from
[54:11] Sodom but they can still feel the effect
[54:13] of Sodom condition so that's why in this
[54:17] last days we are living in in total
[54:21] darkness so we are although we are
[54:24] already recognizing our
[54:26] but still in this place we are still
[54:30] bombarded by all kinds of uh
[54:34] discouragement trials after trial
[54:36] testing after testing and sometimes we
[54:39] can wonder if still God is still caring
[54:41] for us so turn with me in the Book of
[54:44] John Chapter 14 verse one thank you
[54:47] musician God bless you and all the song
[54:51] special I and I believe the song special
[54:54] is also a Min minister to each and every
[54:57] one of us
[54:59] amen John chap 14 verse1
[55:06] to
[55:08] three just a simple thought and I
[55:11] believe that uh just helped me to
[55:14] deliver
[55:18] it so when I brother uh brother stepen
[55:22] and I talk a while ago that are you
[55:24] still nervous brother Mario still I am
[55:26] still
[55:30] sometimes when we try to study too much
[55:34] sometime we cannot get it because we are
[55:37] depending our on our ability but when
[55:40] when we just relax and thank you Lord
[55:43] and leave it unto the Lord and I told
[55:46] brother stepen we don't stand in the
[55:48] Pulpit to entertain people
[55:51] that's if God gave us a message if just
[55:54] only for one soul that is enough because
[55:58] one soul is equivalent to 10,000
[56:01] Soul so praise God maybe this is for
[56:04] somebody Lord and God knows who it is
[56:08] John chapter 14
[56:11] 1-3 says let not your heart be
[56:15] troubled ye believe in God believe also
[56:18] in me so the cure for a troubled heart
[56:22] is to believe the Lord amen amen in my
[56:26] my father's house are many mansions if
[56:30] it were not so I would have told you I
[56:33] go to prepare a place for you thank you
[56:38] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[56:40] I will come again and receive you unto
[56:43] myself that is the promise of God Amen
[56:46] in this second coming he come to receive
[56:49] his
[56:49] bride that where I am there ye may be
[56:54] also praise the Lord and turn with me in
[56:56] 1 Peter chap
[56:58] 5 verse
[57:10] 5-7 it says likewise ye younger submit
[57:14] yourselves unto the Elder yeah and all
[57:17] of you be subject one to another and be
[57:20] cloth with humility for God resisteth
[57:24] the proud and giveth Grace to The Humble
[57:27] amen humble yourselves therefore un the
[57:30] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[57:33] in due time casting all your cares upon
[57:37] Him for he carth for you may the Lord
[57:40] add a blessing upon reading this word
[57:42] you may now be
[57:46] seated amen we believe that
[57:51] uh and the prophet explained that a
[57:54] person is a
[57:56] uh is a three in three banners we have
[58:00] uh the flesh man the spirit man and the
[58:03] Soul amen and we know that we as a born
[58:07] again we recognize that we are already
[58:09] Sons and Daughters of God we are already
[58:11] being
[58:12] converted but likewise the trial and
[58:15] testing still comes amen because we
[58:18] haven't changed yet we we are waiting
[58:20] for the transforming of our bodies so we
[58:22] are uh uh we are under our testings and
[58:25] trials
[58:27] amen so every day we are facing a lot of
[58:31] troubles trial discouragement sometime
[58:33] desperations are all kind of sours that
[58:38] Satan is trying to discourage us that's
[58:41] right on our journey to the promised
[58:42] land amen and often we find ourselves in
[58:47] the midst of troubles and toyss of life
[58:50] and it can be of those time that we
[58:53] could maybe question within ourselves if
[58:57] God really cares for
[59:01] us so we may not even think that on our
[59:05] mind but deep down we can have these
[59:07] little doubts and
[59:09] disappointment and question as if they
[59:12] really if he really does care for us as
[59:15] he say he
[59:17] does because it seems like to our
[59:19] natural way of thinking that if he truly
[59:21] cares for us then he would have diverted
[59:25] us away from the toil and storms that
[59:28] life can throw our way true that is in
[59:33] the human speaking in our experience
[59:35] amen and I believe each and every one of
[59:38] us have been through that kind of trial
[59:40] that sometimes in our deep trial
[59:42] sometimes we
[59:47] question God if he really cares for
[59:50] us because sometimes there we we we
[59:56] don't recognize the acts and the ways of
[1:00:00] God cu the acts is different from his
[1:00:03] ways just like when God revealed to
[1:00:05] Moses his ways and he reveals to Israel
[1:00:09] his
[1:00:10] acts so his act is that he is a Healer
[1:00:13] he is a
[1:00:16] redeemer he is a way maker but sometime
[1:00:20] we mistook his ways into his Acts or we
[1:00:24] don't recognize his ways
[1:00:26] from his
[1:00:27] acts sometimes just like we have
[1:00:31] sickness and sometimes we believe his
[1:00:33] acts as a Healer we believe it but some
[1:00:36] sometimes his ways is
[1:00:38] different so we need to recognize his
[1:00:40] ways from acts because if we don't
[1:00:44] recognize his ways from his act
[1:00:46] sometimes we get discouraged and
[1:00:47] sometimes we question is he really cares
[1:00:49] for
[1:00:51] us and even the
[1:00:54] disciples did the same same thing so
[1:00:58] turn with me in the in the The Book of
[1:01:00] Mark chapter
[1:01:03] 4 and even the disciples question if he
[1:01:07] really cares for
[1:01:09] us so in Mark chapter 4:34 it says but
[1:01:13] without a parable spake he not unto them
[1:01:18] and when they were alone he expounded
[1:01:20] all things to his
[1:01:22] disciples and if we read the whole Mark
[1:01:25] uh uh chapter 4 it speaks about the
[1:01:28] parable of the S so we will not read all
[1:01:32] those scripture will just jump to 34 it
[1:01:36] says but without a parable spake he not
[1:01:38] unto them and when they were alone he
[1:01:41] expounded all things to his disciples so
[1:01:43] we see we we will notice the difference
[1:01:46] between his public Teaching Ministry and
[1:01:49] his private Teaching Ministry amen so
[1:01:53] his private teaching min Ministry is to
[1:01:57] expound the word to his disciples but
[1:02:00] without the parable he spake unto them
[1:02:03] not so we believe that he is still the
[1:02:06] same yesterday today and forever amen
[1:02:09] and we recognize his presence that's why
[1:02:12] this ministry is expounding the word
[1:02:15] that was sealed before the foundation of
[1:02:18] the word is expounding into this
[1:02:21] generation so that is the difference
[1:02:23] because this ministry of Malachi 4 is
[1:02:27] personally to the elect in these last
[1:02:29] days because I will send to you Elijah
[1:02:33] the prophet so this is to a
[1:02:37] specific people in these last days amen
[1:02:40] this ministry of Belia is not for
[1:02:43] everybody but only for
[1:02:46] you which was described in Malachi chap
[1:02:49] 4 and if this prophecy there must be a
[1:02:53] people to fulfill fill that prophecy so
[1:02:58] in other words we are called the people
[1:02:59] of the prophecy if there is a prophecy
[1:03:02] there must be a people to manifest that
[1:03:05] prophecy but then we are not different
[1:03:09] we are still have trials and testing and
[1:03:12] sometimes we get discouraged and
[1:03:14] sometimes we get
[1:03:16] desperation that's right that's why if
[1:03:19] we lack prayers we lack reading the word
[1:03:25] that's why
[1:03:26] sometimes we wonder why troubles come in
[1:03:31] so that's why John in the Book of
[1:03:34] Revelation said blessed are they that
[1:03:36] read the word
[1:03:39] amen so if you feel you don't you are
[1:03:42] not blessed just read the word that's
[1:03:44] right because he said blessed are they
[1:03:46] that read the word and if you cannot
[1:03:49] read the word you can still hear the
[1:03:51] word that's right amen and I believe
[1:03:54] that if you read the word God will come
[1:03:57] on the scene and expound to to you his
[1:04:00] word because that is his private
[1:04:02] Ministry to the Bride of Jesus
[1:04:06] Christ and verse 35 and the same day
[1:04:10] when even was come he said unto them so
[1:04:14] he's giving them a promise let us pass
[1:04:17] over unto the other
[1:04:20] side and the same day when the even was
[1:04:23] come so even was the evening time and we
[1:04:26] are now in the evening time and we have
[1:04:28] the promise to cross over to pass over
[1:04:31] into the other land amen hallelujah just
[1:04:33] like Noah he's from the other world he
[1:04:36] passed through the other world Moses
[1:04:39] from Egypt to the Red Sea he's passing
[1:04:42] over to another land amen Joshua from
[1:04:47] Jordan River he's passing to another
[1:04:49] land Enoch is passing into another land
[1:04:52] and we are promised this last day that
[1:04:54] we will we will pass into the other land
[1:04:58] from Mortal to immortality that is the
[1:05:01] promise of God hallelujah thank you
[1:05:06] Lord so in this story here's showing
[1:05:10] something of our life because in this
[1:05:12] story we see that he was going to be
[1:05:14] with
[1:05:16] them not only he
[1:05:19] promised because the one who made the
[1:05:21] promise is the one who will fulfill the
[1:05:23] promise that's right when he made the
[1:05:27] promise he didn't promise them to be
[1:05:30] alone he's going with
[1:05:33] them so that's why the promise for us I
[1:05:36] will be with you even and to the end of
[1:05:38] the world and when they had sent away
[1:05:41] the multitude they took him even as he
[1:05:44] was in the ship and there were also with
[1:05:46] him other ships and there arose a great
[1:05:49] storm of winds and waves bit into the
[1:05:52] ship so that it was now full
[1:05:59] so the great
[1:06:01] storm when your boat is full of water in
[1:06:04] great storm and wind and waves and sea
[1:06:07] spray in pit black at night you don't
[1:06:10] get a lot worse situation than
[1:06:14] that and many of must find ourself in
[1:06:16] this places while on our journey of Life
[1:06:19] between this two world Amen one way or
[1:06:23] another we can experience the worst part
[1:06:25] in our life maybe you are in a worse
[1:06:28] part of your journey this
[1:06:30] morning and sometimes you question go
[1:06:33] did God really
[1:06:34] cares on because you only recognize his
[1:06:39] acts if I am in that situation I know
[1:06:42] God Will Make A Way because that was his
[1:06:45] acts but we need to recognize his ways
[1:06:48] amen during trouble times not only his
[1:06:52] act because we know that God can make
[1:06:54] anything because he was God he but we we
[1:06:58] need to know his
[1:07:03] ways and when he was and when he was in
[1:07:07] the hinder part of the ship so the
[1:07:08] hinder part is in the back part of the
[1:07:12] ship but at least he was in the ship
[1:07:16] right and sometimes in times of trouble
[1:07:18] we can find that some is God is not with
[1:07:21] us is God is leaving me no he was in the
[1:07:24] hinder part of the ch
[1:07:26] he never leave you when he promised he
[1:07:28] is in that promise and whatever
[1:07:31] situation we are in he never let go of
[1:07:34] himself he is still there in the hinder
[1:07:36] part hallelujah thank you he never leave
[1:07:40] you nor forsake you amen amen but we
[1:07:43] need to realize his ways yes Hallelujah
[1:07:48] he was in the hinder part of the sheep
[1:07:50] asleep on a pillow and they awake him
[1:07:52] and say master carest thou not that we
[1:07:56] perish the same question when trouble
[1:07:59] time comes sometimes they even the
[1:08:02] disciples ask
[1:08:04] him are you caring for
[1:08:07] us so notice how they when they were
[1:08:10] faced with such this Spirit situation
[1:08:12] the first thing they did was question
[1:08:14] his care for them right carest thou not
[1:08:17] that we
[1:08:18] perish he cared for them more than they
[1:08:21] could ever know that's right there was
[1:08:24] no human being on earth that could have
[1:08:26] ever cared
[1:08:27] for for them any more than this man did
[1:08:30] because he was God himself who had come
[1:08:33] down on Earth and became men all because
[1:08:36] of this great and careful love of them
[1:08:40] and us thank you Lord for while we were
[1:08:43] yet sinners Christ died for
[1:08:46] us and he who knows no sin becomes sin
[1:08:49] that we might become his very
[1:08:52] righteousness he cares so much about us
[1:08:54] amen HJ
[1:08:58] Hallelujah
[1:09:01] so and he said unto him why are you so
[1:09:04] fearful how is it that you have no
[1:09:09] faith so here Jesus
[1:09:12] identifies the reason of their
[1:09:16] fear and that because their lack of
[1:09:19] faith
[1:09:22] right in his promises
[1:09:26] that he made to them in that he said
[1:09:28] they would get to the other side that
[1:09:30] was already done it was already finished
[1:09:33] amen that's right let us pass over into
[1:09:36] the other
[1:09:38] land you cannot add to it or take away
[1:09:41] from it god require us to believe the
[1:09:45] promise let us pass over into the other
[1:09:48] land but they when when desparation when
[1:09:53] circumstances arise they question he
[1:09:56] SC because they are looking at his
[1:10:03] AXS but they haven't recognized his ways
[1:10:07] yet right so that's why that's why
[1:10:10] that's why Jesus cried how is it that
[1:10:12] you have no faith so Jesus identified
[1:10:15] the reason of Their Fear was because
[1:10:17] lack of faith in his promises that he
[1:10:19] made to them in that he said they would
[1:10:21] go to the other side he already spoken
[1:10:24] the word let us pass on the other
[1:10:27] side and the Very one who made the
[1:10:29] promise was
[1:10:31] also in the boat with them because when
[1:10:34] God promised he will be the one to make
[1:10:38] manifest that
[1:10:39] promise but instead of believing and
[1:10:42] having confidence in that his word would
[1:10:44] never fail instead they doubted the word
[1:10:46] and questioned his care for
[1:10:50] them I think we are living in reality of
[1:10:53] our experience in life
[1:10:56] yeah these are the same disciple that
[1:10:58] had witnessed the
[1:11:00] supernatural of the healing revivals and
[1:11:03] miracles and everything and witness the
[1:11:06] teachings the Revival in his day they
[1:11:09] see the acts of the supernatural of the
[1:11:12] healings of the
[1:11:13] Miracles even by the way he he preached
[1:11:16] the doctrine in the church they
[1:11:18] recognized when when Trouble
[1:11:20] Comes they question his care for them
[1:11:26] just like in our journey recognize
[1:11:28] sometimes the presence of God we can
[1:11:29] shout sometimes we can cry and we
[1:11:32] recognize praise God the supernatural
[1:11:34] the acts of God in our lives but
[1:11:37] sometimes we cannot understand his way
[1:11:39] sometimes we doubt because we cannot
[1:11:41] understand his ways his act is different
[1:11:43] from his
[1:11:44] ways and sometimes we
[1:11:47] question is he really cares for
[1:11:53] us amen in Mark
[1:11:57] 4
[1:12:00] 11 verse 12 he said unto them unto you
[1:12:03] it is given to know the mystery of the
[1:12:05] kingdom of God but unto them that are
[1:12:07] without all these things are done in
[1:12:11] parables in the public the secret things
[1:12:14] is hidden but to each and every one of
[1:12:18] us it was given expounded but yet when
[1:12:21] trouble come they question the cares of
[1:12:23] God
[1:12:29] sometimes it's hard to Gras the ways of
[1:12:31] God Amen because we know his acts he can
[1:12:34] heal he can perform
[1:12:36] Miracles but we are not limited to his
[1:12:39] acts that's why Jesus Christ said I am
[1:12:42] the way the truth and the life and his
[1:12:45] ways are higher than our ways and his
[1:12:48] thought are higher than all thoughts so
[1:12:50] that's why we cannot figure out God we
[1:12:53] just need to believe by faith
[1:12:56] in his promises of God whatever things
[1:12:59] that he will do he will perform it
[1:13:01] according to his ways not according to
[1:13:05] our ways oh we can figure out what the
[1:13:08] next thing to do amen so we just need to
[1:13:12] walk by faith and seeing they may see
[1:13:15] and not perceive and hearing they may
[1:13:17] hear and not understand less any time
[1:13:19] they should be converted and their sins
[1:13:22] could be
[1:13:23] forgiven so unless you are being being
[1:13:25] converted you cannot understand the
[1:13:27] message of the hour so that's why Jesus
[1:13:30] Christ said you need to be born again
[1:13:32] you must be born again receive the Holy
[1:13:35] Spirit and when the Holy Spirit Come he
[1:13:37] will guide you into all truth that is
[1:13:40] why the prophet of God in this told us
[1:13:42] that Revelation is more important to you
[1:13:45] than what you realize so Revelation is
[1:13:50] important amen we may know all the
[1:13:53] scripture we may know all the message
[1:13:55] but unless God revealed to you his
[1:13:58] ways amen we will continue to question
[1:14:02] his
[1:14:04] care so we know that revelation of the
[1:14:07] word is just a simple clear
[1:14:09] understanding given to you by G of the
[1:14:12] meaning of the word of what God's
[1:14:15] original thought of it is because
[1:14:19] Revelation is the thought of God given
[1:14:22] to you thank you Lord once the
[1:14:24] Revelation is is given to you then you
[1:14:27] will
[1:14:29] know that it was the thought of
[1:14:32] God Amen in other words the same thought
[1:14:36] of what was in God's mind is now in your
[1:14:40] mind also amen that's it is the very
[1:14:43] thought of God by the word of God
[1:14:45] regarding a certain truth being made
[1:14:48] clear to your mind by works of the inner
[1:14:51] teacher amen when you receive the Holy
[1:14:54] Ghost it will be an inside teacher in
[1:14:57] your heart thank you this is what God
[1:15:01] has done for us who are his disciple is
[1:15:05] bright in this day through the voice of
[1:15:07] the seventh
[1:15:08] angel give us the Revelation those
[1:15:11] mystery that was hidden before the
[1:15:13] foundation of the word is now open and
[1:15:17] what was in the back part of God's mind
[1:15:20] before the world was ever created was
[1:15:23] now in the bride amen praise the
[1:15:27] Lord so we have seen him in this end
[1:15:29] time in the revealing of the son of man
[1:15:31] Ministry for those of us who are in uh
[1:15:35] in the message of the hour we have marel
[1:15:37] at things he has done in our
[1:15:40] time in the ministry of the Prophet just
[1:15:43] as disciple and followers marveled in
[1:15:45] the things they saw him do at the time
[1:15:47] of this Corporal
[1:15:49] Ministry and just as they knew he was
[1:15:52] them in the boat we know full well that
[1:15:55] he is with us in the boat in this hour
[1:15:57] because he is the same yesterday today
[1:15:59] and forever he never leave
[1:16:01] us
[1:16:03] hallelujah that is the
[1:16:06] Assurance we will go or pass to another
[1:16:09] land that is his
[1:16:13] Assurance Jen may have
[1:16:16] felt well just we know full well that
[1:16:19] he's with us in the boat because he's
[1:16:22] the same yesterday today he promised
[1:16:24] that he would never leave us nor forsake
[1:16:26] us and thank you Lord for that promises
[1:16:29] amen
[1:16:30] hallelujah when John the Baptist was in
[1:16:33] the prison house under herod's judgment
[1:16:36] we know that John also questioned God's
[1:16:38] care for him you know that John the
[1:16:41] Baptist for run the first coming of
[1:16:43] Christ amen he was so bold to rebuke
[1:16:47] herod's wife amen and he when he was put
[1:16:50] in prison now Trouble Comes
[1:16:55] J may have felt like God had abandoned
[1:16:57] him in his prison house why I introduced
[1:17:00] Jesus Christ I saw the spirit of God
[1:17:03] coming down and I heard the voice this
[1:17:05] is my beloved Son in whom I dwell dwell
[1:17:09] pleased but now I am in prison and he is
[1:17:13] not coming I don't know if what my my
[1:17:16] Ministry is real or no if he is the real
[1:17:19] Messiah and he felt maybe he don't cares
[1:17:24] right
[1:17:28] and so he had become offended because of
[1:17:31] the storm of his
[1:17:33] life it looked to John like God didn't
[1:17:36] care for him anymore because he had
[1:17:37] seemingly left him in the prison to R
[1:17:41] but we know that God did care for him
[1:17:42] for we know that John did arrive safely
[1:17:45] on the other side amen for the
[1:17:48] believer's death only makes way for you
[1:17:51] to arrive safely on the other side amen
[1:17:54] so in Romans 9:32 and
[1:17:58] 33 he said wherefore because they sought
[1:18:01] it not by
[1:18:05] faith but as it were by works of the law
[1:18:08] for they stumble at that stumbling
[1:18:11] block as it is written behold I lay in
[1:18:15] Zion a stumbling block stumbling stone
[1:18:19] and a rock of offense and whosoever
[1:18:21] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[1:18:24] amen so Jesus was referred to as the
[1:18:27] rock of
[1:18:29] offense if you lack Faith or Revelation
[1:18:31] in him and his
[1:18:33] promises then his ways of dealing with
[1:18:36] you could become offensive right and
[1:18:39] cause you to
[1:18:42] stumbled I serve God why he didn't do
[1:18:44] this why he didn't save me why we can
[1:18:48] questions about that because it is easy
[1:18:51] for people to become offended at God in
[1:18:53] the ways of dealing
[1:18:55] with us because of how we humans
[1:18:57] sometime misunderstand God's higher ways
[1:19:00] of thinking concerning us amen we think
[1:19:04] that his care should be to protect us
[1:19:06] from all trouble so that we without
[1:19:08] never be in we will never encoun aaging
[1:19:11] storms in life not realizing that it is
[1:19:15] this very storm of life that is care for
[1:19:18] us is truly revealed and made manifest
[1:19:22] that's right amen praise
[1:19:25] God so that's why Peter and 4 chapter
[1:19:29] chapter 4: 1213 he said beloved think it
[1:19:32] not
[1:19:33] strange concerning the fiery
[1:19:35] trials which is to try you as though you
[1:19:38] strange thing happened to
[1:19:42] you but rejoice as much as ye are
[1:19:45] partakers of Christ suffering amen that
[1:19:48] when his glory shall be revealed ye may
[1:19:51] be glad also with exceeding Joy
[1:19:55] amen if life was just one big smooth
[1:19:58] sailing from sea to shining sea then we
[1:20:01] would never really come to know his
[1:20:03] great love and care for
[1:20:11] us so in the message he cared for you
[1:20:15] where brother Bram got this inspiration
[1:20:18] when he preached he got this experience
[1:20:20] in his life that he was so down and he
[1:20:24] said that for 33 years of his ministry
[1:20:28] he come
[1:20:29] closest to just giving in to
[1:20:33] Satan he was in his lowest of his life
[1:20:38] so in the message he carried for you he
[1:20:40] said that standing y in the hospital
[1:20:43] when I come the closest of my 30 years
[1:20:47] of ministry clam come the closest of
[1:20:50] ever
[1:20:52] giving to Satan
[1:20:56] that must be very very hard trials in
[1:20:59] the life of the
[1:21:01] Prophet for 33 years of his ministry he
[1:21:04] come closest to giving in to
[1:21:08] Satan when my little girl Sharon Rose
[1:21:11] was dying in the hospital I stood there
[1:21:13] and the doctor didn't even know I was in
[1:21:15] the
[1:21:17] room he would let me go in because he
[1:21:19] said meaning J he said Billy you'll give
[1:21:21] it to Billy Jr would go he said and he
[1:21:24] said set me down he told me and the
[1:21:26] nurse said go get some medicine and give
[1:21:28] him she come out with little glass about
[1:21:32] that high and said take this brother
[1:21:34] bham and he said just sit down and I
[1:21:35] watched her till she got out of the room
[1:21:37] and down through the hole I went and
[1:21:39] down into the basement brother bam is
[1:21:42] struggling during the time he saw his
[1:21:45] wife died and now her daughter is dying
[1:21:48] with
[1:21:50] mintis and there lay my baby laying
[1:21:53] there with flies in his ey
[1:21:55] a little mosquito bar of thing over the
[1:21:57] top of his face it kick it off and I
[1:22:01] look over to the little fellow mothers
[1:22:03] laying in the
[1:22:04] mors and some sometimes we are in the
[1:22:06] situations like
[1:22:08] this troubles after
[1:22:11] troubl trouble there trouble there just
[1:22:13] like job yes there is a messeng coming
[1:22:18] oh your your your all your livestocks
[1:22:21] already died there after just maybe a
[1:22:24] few minutes then all your livelihood
[1:22:26] that trials after
[1:22:29] trials and this if did happened to job
[1:22:32] it happened to brother Brenham amen and
[1:22:34] he said that I must I I I was closest to
[1:22:37] giving in to
[1:22:41] Satan and I look over Little P my mother
[1:22:44] lay in the morning her little brother
[1:22:46] Billy in hospital seriously sick and my
[1:22:48] father had just died on my arms a few
[1:22:50] weeks before and my brother killed
[1:22:53] instantly what a tragedy if you look at
[1:22:56] in the
[1:22:59] physical and we will really question God
[1:23:02] if he really the prophet of
[1:23:05] God his father died his brother died
[1:23:08] instantly now his wife died now he's not
[1:23:11] to
[1:23:16] die and if there was I mean nothing but
[1:23:19] a boy preaching and I look over at her
[1:23:21] and I look and said oh Sharon honey this
[1:23:23] is dy do you know me and I know she know
[1:23:26] me she was trying to look like wave
[1:23:29] goodbye to me and her little eye was
[1:23:31] crossing she was suffering so hard I
[1:23:33] could see those little blue eye
[1:23:36] Crossing and then I look at her and I
[1:23:39] feel on my knee and I said God her mama
[1:23:42] lays young in the mor and we're so bury
[1:23:45] him bury her in the morning don't take
[1:23:48] my baby Lord let me raise her she's so
[1:23:51] sweet don't care Lord just then look
[1:23:54] like like black come unfolding just
[1:23:56] shut up the vision from her and take her
[1:23:58] anyhow and raise up you are petitioning
[1:24:01] God with all your heart with all your
[1:24:03] mind and with all your soul believing
[1:24:05] that God Will Make A Way because you
[1:24:08] preach God that is a Healer preach God
[1:24:11] that is a deliverer but there was a time
[1:24:13] that even God Is So
[1:24:17] silen and brother Bram is struggling in
[1:24:20] his
[1:24:22] spirit and then Satan come to my
[1:24:25] sight remember Satan is faithful in his
[1:24:29] duty that's right he will do everything
[1:24:33] to hinder us to discourage us Amen to to
[1:24:39] disappoint us he is always in the Sin
[1:24:44] and even in this congregation he is in
[1:24:46] the
[1:24:46] Sin maybe the preacher is preaching and
[1:24:49] he's saying something you don't listen
[1:24:52] to that preacher
[1:24:54] his accent I cannot understand his
[1:25:00] accent he don't know how to speak
[1:25:05] English if God is here he's always here
[1:25:09] thank you because he is always on the
[1:25:11] opposite
[1:25:12] side so and then Satan come to come to
[1:25:16] my side and he said and then you serve
[1:25:18] him is
[1:25:21] questioning the same as he questioned
[1:25:24] you when you are in
[1:25:27] trouble are you really the son of God
[1:25:30] are you really a daughter of
[1:25:32] God because Satan knows the act of God I
[1:25:36] know God Is A Healer I know God is a
[1:25:39] miracle worker I know God is a
[1:25:41] redeemer but why didn't he
[1:25:45] heal your daughter your wife your
[1:25:50] father
[1:25:52] why there's always a question question
[1:25:55] and he's good at questioning that's
[1:25:58] right and then you observe him here you
[1:26:02] are nothing but a
[1:26:06] okay and then you serve him here you are
[1:26:09] nothing but a boy and you mean what have
[1:26:11] you done stood on the street corner
[1:26:13] everywhere you could and fasted till you
[1:26:16] was so weak you couldn't climb a
[1:26:19] telephone poll to do your work and have
[1:26:21] you done but preach and cried and pray
[1:26:25] come
[1:26:26] on it seems that he was encouraging him
[1:26:30] when you are still a boy you preach from
[1:26:32] corner that when you're fasting and you
[1:26:35] preach he's he's good at manipulating
[1:26:38] words that's
[1:26:42] right you pasted till you was weak you
[1:26:44] could climb telephone pole to do your
[1:26:46] work and have you done but preached and
[1:26:48] cried and prayed and one word from here
[1:26:51] would change the whole picture but would
[1:26:53] he do do
[1:26:55] it just like how he temp Eve you may eat
[1:26:59] all the trees of the of the garden but
[1:27:03] surely you will not
[1:27:05] die so he's still this questioning the
[1:27:08] same and one word from him would change
[1:27:10] the whole picture but would he do it no
[1:27:13] he won't do it he let her die and then
[1:27:15] you'll turn around serve him come
[1:27:18] almost so Satan is teasing him yeah amen
[1:27:24] so when my leg wouldn't hold me up no
[1:27:26] longer I lean on the bed and I said Sher
[1:27:28] you know
[1:27:29] Daddy hear her wishing like and she had
[1:27:32] looked like she was dying and I thought
[1:27:34] just one word he wouldn't have to even
[1:27:37] speak he just looked his own mind would
[1:27:40] just change the picture and the meaning
[1:27:42] Jus would leave her and she'll be well
[1:27:44] just one word but he won't do
[1:27:48] it so look at how he is munding the care
[1:27:51] of God this is a hard thing to
[1:27:54] understand amen just one word being a
[1:27:57] prophet being a servant of God he can
[1:27:59] say God lord I am your
[1:28:01] servant I do everything that in
[1:28:05] my in my strength to do your will but
[1:28:08] just this one Lord just speak just one
[1:28:12] word but God is
[1:28:16] silence and Satan said then you'll
[1:28:19] continue to serve
[1:28:22] him this is the time when brother bam
[1:28:24] struggled so much that he said this is
[1:28:27] the closest
[1:28:29] thing in his life that he try to it's
[1:28:33] almost try to give in to Satan right and
[1:28:37] I thought where would I
[1:28:39] go right amen what could I do or who
[1:28:44] could I go to and where's my hope
[1:28:48] something happened to me I said a few
[1:28:49] years ago down here and I know that I
[1:28:51] love him amen that's your anchor to know
[1:28:55] that you love him to know and recognize
[1:28:58] that he loves you and in return you love
[1:29:01] him that's the real thing that's the
[1:29:04] anchor of our so I walk over to the bed
[1:29:07] and put my hands on my little little
[1:29:09] head and I said darling God gave you and
[1:29:12] God's taking you away blessed be the
[1:29:14] name of the Lord amen though you slay me
[1:29:17] yet I'll Trust you yes sir I'll take you
[1:29:20] darling and lay on your mother's arm Y
[1:29:23] in The Undertaker's mors in about an
[1:29:26] hour from now but yet if he kills me
[1:29:29] there's nothing I can go to he's the
[1:29:32] only hope that I ever found he's the
[1:29:34] only foundation he's the only comfort
[1:29:37] that I ever had and where I could go now
[1:29:40] for Comfort if it wasn't to
[1:29:44] him and when I said that the angel come
[1:29:47] and pack her away and I just almost
[1:29:50] collapsed but something happened he was
[1:29:53] my confort he came to me he cared for me
[1:29:57] this is where God or brother bam take
[1:30:01] his inspiration he carth for you in
[1:30:04] times of this trouble God cared so much
[1:30:06] that he took little Sharon Rose home so
[1:30:09] that he could give her to the prophet
[1:30:11] for eternity amen thank you and brother
[1:30:15] brandham saw her on the other side
[1:30:16] behind the curtain of time and he was a
[1:30:18] young beautiful woman during that time
[1:30:22] Hallelujah that could never have hurt
[1:30:24] ache or disappointment or trouble God
[1:30:27] had spared little sh rose from a little
[1:30:29] full of struggle and disappointment of
[1:30:32] this world and maybe in life she would
[1:30:34] have gone astray from the Lord but God's
[1:30:36] Great care for her amen and cared for
[1:30:39] his Prophet that is the way of God thank
[1:30:43] you Lord Abes our ways God had a purpose
[1:30:47] amen hallelujah God only knows the
[1:30:50] struggle of brother Bram but God knows
[1:30:53] Beyond those
[1:30:54] trouble there is a way Hallelujah are
[1:30:58] you older and wise in the way of life
[1:31:00] and things of God then you begin to
[1:31:02] understand more of God's Great way of
[1:31:04] care in dealing with his children Amen
[1:31:07] in order to reveal himself to you so you
[1:31:09] begin to see life in a different way
[1:31:11] when you begin to realize that you are
[1:31:14] passing through from one side to the
[1:31:16] other amen and that storm in the middle
[1:31:19] is allowed by God in order to reveal
[1:31:22] himself and his great love and cares
[1:31:25] towards you thank because he cares for
[1:31:28] you more than you could ever know he
[1:31:29] cared so much that he gave his own life
[1:31:33] but when Trouble Comes Hallelujah it
[1:31:36] show that he cares about us it's not
[1:31:39] about the supernatural that we all see
[1:31:42] in his acts but his cares is different
[1:31:46] from his acts his ways is different
[1:31:48] thank you Lord so in the message I know
[1:31:51] he said it is written in one of the
[1:31:53] scripture in the Bible the trials are
[1:31:56] brought upon us are more precious to us
[1:32:00] than God
[1:32:02] itself for it is God giving us this
[1:32:04] trial so when trial comes your
[1:32:07] way the prophet said it was
[1:32:11] God giving us these
[1:32:14] trials after we become his property we
[1:32:18] are now property of God that's right if
[1:32:20] we are married to Christ we are his amen
[1:32:26] we become his property our confession
[1:32:28] our baptism and our promises to walk in
[1:32:31] Life or him then every trial that comes
[1:32:34] upon us is to perfect us for his
[1:32:38] glory put that in mind that's right
[1:32:42] every trial that comes upon us is to
[1:32:45] perfect us for his glory is to bring us
[1:32:48] to a place where God can make himself
[1:32:51] more real to us than he was before trial
[1:32:55] comes amen so that's why God and trial
[1:32:58] and come so that's God will become so
[1:33:01] more
[1:33:02] real
[1:33:05] amen before the trial comes so thank you
[1:33:09] for the
[1:33:12] trials don't think that he don't care
[1:33:15] for you when he gave you
[1:33:17] trials that's his ways of showing he
[1:33:22] cares so we need to distinguish between
[1:33:25] his acts and his
[1:33:27] ways because we cannot fathom his ways
[1:33:30] we just need to go by faith because
[1:33:33] everything is order when he said I will
[1:33:35] pass over the land it's already done
[1:33:37] it's already finished but in the
[1:33:39] middle there is a trouble inside
[1:33:43] amen
[1:33:45] and he questioned them you of little
[1:33:51] faith every trial that comes upon us is
[1:33:54] to perfect us for His Glory thank you
[1:33:56] Lord It's to bring us to a place where
[1:33:58] God can make himself more real to us
[1:34:02] that he was before the trial come I want
[1:34:04] to join this morning uh with job to say
[1:34:07] that I believe long enough to know
[1:34:09] that's the truth I have seen it in my
[1:34:12] own life that every time a great
[1:34:13] situation Rises that I can get around it
[1:34:16] or under it or over it God makes a way
[1:34:21] and comes out glorious Hallelujah
[1:34:23] whatever situation we are in right now
[1:34:27] he will always come out
[1:34:29] glorious so that's why trial and testing
[1:34:31] are bombarding and in every walks of
[1:34:33] life because God is going to prove that
[1:34:36] greater is he that is in you than is the
[1:34:38] world he was the one that will prove it
[1:34:42] so that's why he gave all the trials the
[1:34:44] testing the discouragement in life to
[1:34:47] prove his word that greater is he that
[1:34:49] is in us and this is the word hallelujah
[1:34:52] and remember all this thing Satan tries
[1:34:54] to make us nervous and upset us to get
[1:34:57] us to think oh why did this happen why
[1:34:59] would have been like this and the
[1:35:02] prophet said it is order to redeem you
[1:35:05] back to
[1:35:06] himself amen hallelujah that's why first
[1:35:10] Peter 56 our opening scripture said
[1:35:12] humble yourselves therefore under the
[1:35:14] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[1:35:17] in you season whatever things comes our
[1:35:20] way let us not interpret it in our mind
[1:35:22] maybe this maybe that maybe this lean
[1:35:25] unto thy own understanding with all thy
[1:35:27] ways acknowledge Him and humble himself
[1:35:30] whatever things that he wants to do with
[1:35:32] us let his name be glorified amen
[1:35:34] casting all your cares upon Him for he
[1:35:37] carth for you casting all give all your
[1:35:40] burden give your problem give your
[1:35:43] anxiety give your depression give your
[1:35:45] troubles give whatever it is cast it
[1:35:47] unto him for he carth for you thank you
[1:35:52] Jesus in the message cared for you now
[1:35:55] you might heard the scripture
[1:35:57] before but let's take heed to
[1:36:01] them are they
[1:36:04] true
[1:36:06] amen because it's easy to
[1:36:09] read and even memorize but unless you
[1:36:12] experience it you cannot really
[1:36:15] appreciate it in your life now you might
[1:36:17] heard the scripture before but let's
[1:36:19] take heed to them are they
[1:36:22] true they are true than your setting in
[1:36:25] this church tonight they're more truer
[1:36:28] than this in the state of Arizona
[1:36:31] they're more truer than you are in a
[1:36:34] live human being they are God's Eternal
[1:36:36] words and his promises and all Heaven
[1:36:39] and Earth will pass away but them word
[1:36:41] shall never pass amen they have meaning
[1:36:44] meaning Sublime but they'll never
[1:36:47] meaning nothing to you until God reveals
[1:36:50] them to you and how beautiful it is to
[1:36:53] know that he cares for us then if he
[1:36:56] cares for us then we would also care for
[1:36:59] him am amen for his cause and his body
[1:37:03] of Believers on Earth just showing
[1:37:05] someone that you care for them can bring
[1:37:07] healing to their wounded spirit
[1:37:11] amen he carth for you thank you so that
[1:37:15] every Tri and testing we need to
[1:37:17] distinguish his acts and his
[1:37:19] ways when trial come don't say okay this
[1:37:23] is God you said you said you said you
[1:37:25] said but we will his ways will never
[1:37:28] know unless he reveal it something to us
[1:37:31] and I believe God is in the business of
[1:37:33] revealing himself more and more not only
[1:37:36] he is revealed word being magnified but
[1:37:41] also in our struggle in life we need to
[1:37:44] understand the struggles of
[1:37:45] life he said that just showing someone
[1:37:48] that you care for them can bring healing
[1:37:50] to their wounded spirit amen
[1:37:54] in the message he came paragraph 44 and
[1:37:57] we believe that doctors help people as
[1:38:01] the prophet said they are just
[1:38:03] instrument in helping the people I
[1:38:06] believe that God heals by
[1:38:08] medicine so Prophet is not a fanatic he
[1:38:13] believes God in everything he is so
[1:38:16] balanced because when we become fanatic
[1:38:18] of God we say that God heals all kind of
[1:38:21] diseases and somebody says always don't
[1:38:23] need medicine because God
[1:38:26] heals God Is So
[1:38:30] balanced
[1:38:32] that's and I meet some of the brothers
[1:38:35] in the Philippines that
[1:38:36] they become one-sided
[1:38:40] right they don't take
[1:38:43] medicine if they even they have
[1:38:45] toothache they believe that God heals by
[1:38:48] medicine who experience having a tooth
[1:38:51] AE woo
[1:38:57] two days three
[1:38:59] days it will swell it will get infected
[1:39:03] and because they believe that God heals
[1:39:05] and no need medicine they try to live up
[1:39:08] according to their faith I believe I
[1:39:11] believe God will heal I don't need
[1:39:14] medicine amen two three 4 days he cannot
[1:39:19] bear the pain so he took the medicine
[1:39:24] so another one they believe God don't he
[1:39:29] medicine and his daughter got the
[1:39:33] lbm they don't believe in medicine
[1:39:35] though they
[1:39:36] don't bring her to the doctor until she
[1:39:40] pass away of the hydration then
[1:39:44] another daughter do the
[1:39:47] same then he
[1:39:49] decided that he will bring it to the
[1:39:52] doctor
[1:39:54] but the prophet here said I believe that
[1:39:56] God heals my
[1:40:01] medicine and the prophet said that any
[1:40:04] sensible person if he don't feel good or
[1:40:08] he don't feel right he need to see a
[1:40:11] doctor
[1:40:14] amen you don't figure out what you feel
[1:40:18] and just say I believe God will heal me
[1:40:20] yes how can God heal you if he don't
[1:40:24] know what you
[1:40:26] feel because God is so
[1:40:29] specific so we need to see a doctor and
[1:40:33] the doctor who studied medicine will
[1:40:37] tell you what is your trouble in life if
[1:40:40] you have a cancer then he was identified
[1:40:44] then you can bring it un the presence of
[1:40:46] the Lord Am Lord I have a Cancer and you
[1:40:48] believe Lord I believe that you healed
[1:40:51] all kind of disease and I believe it and
[1:40:53] God will perform it
[1:40:55] amen amen but if you cannot
[1:40:59] identify what you
[1:41:02] feel sometimes you drink a lot of
[1:41:04] medicine according to your understanding
[1:41:07] so if instead of getting well you're
[1:41:10] getting
[1:41:12] worse so God Is So balanced thank you
[1:41:15] for the word in these last days we have
[1:41:18] a balanced God we have a balanced
[1:41:20] message we believe that doctors help
[1:41:22] people they heal when you are wounded
[1:41:26] they heal
[1:41:27] stress amen they heal you operate or
[1:41:30] something like that I believe that God
[1:41:32] heals by medicine God heals by
[1:41:35] surgery and God heals by understanding
[1:41:40] amen we need to expand our understanding
[1:41:44] because let the love of God cover all
[1:41:46] kind of sin we may say we may we may
[1:41:51] face a lot of issues face a lot of
[1:41:53] misunderstanding as brother Ron said we
[1:41:55] may be uh disagreeing certain point but
[1:41:59] it doesn't mean that we will be
[1:42:01] disagreeable with one another we need to
[1:42:04] respect one another's opinion and if we
[1:42:07] expand our understanding God can heals
[1:42:11] the broken relationship amen
[1:42:14] amen God heals by love and that love
[1:42:18] don't and we know that the love of God
[1:42:21] is agap love that is the Divine love of
[1:42:24] God Amen everyone of us has been tried
[1:42:29] and
[1:42:31] tested just like when brother Bram is
[1:42:34] preaching that before he preached there
[1:42:36] was a a a vision given to him there
[1:42:39] there will be a trap when you preach
[1:42:41] this morning and he don't know what kind
[1:42:43] of trap was
[1:42:45] that and when he start preaching there
[1:42:48] was a young couple in front of the
[1:42:51] pulpit and they are kissing one
[1:42:54] another and the prophet that was the TRU
[1:42:57] Y and the Holy Spirit told him you can
[1:43:00] say whatever you want and God will do it
[1:43:04] he can curse them he can judge them and
[1:43:07] God will do it because it was God who
[1:43:09] get the inspiration
[1:43:13] amen but it was the love of God that
[1:43:16] said I forgive you the same likewise in
[1:43:20] our situations in life Maybe maybe
[1:43:23] somebody's against us maybe our family
[1:43:25] or brothers or sisters or minister or
[1:43:28] something that we
[1:43:29] encounter and sometimes as if we cannot
[1:43:33] hold our peace and we'll just curse
[1:43:37] them you go your way I go my way if we
[1:43:40] cannot understand one another anyway as
[1:43:43] we how can to agree if they how can they
[1:43:45] walk together if they don't
[1:43:47] agree but we need to have an agapo Lev
[1:43:51] an understanding of things because
[1:43:54] everything our ways we need to know
[1:43:57] God's ways amen not only his acts but
[1:44:01] his
[1:44:02] ways because his ways is beyond our ways
[1:44:06] and his thought are beyond our thought
[1:44:08] we need to expand our understanding
[1:44:10] Beyond human reasoning that's true so
[1:44:13] that we can see God in our midst God
[1:44:16] heals by understanding God heals by love
[1:44:19] just a little goes a long way just a
[1:44:21] little love of showing you care yes just
[1:44:24] that just just like brother Ron said if
[1:44:26] you don't see anyone just give him a
[1:44:29] text hi hello how are you that's
[1:44:32] enough I remember I remember when we
[1:44:35] first got married my wife wife the first
[1:44:38] three years is that is the adjustment
[1:44:41] adjustment period you have a lot of
[1:44:43] adjustment and qu qu and sometimes we
[1:44:46] get disappointed we don't go to church
[1:44:48] we just we just hide ourselves in the
[1:44:50] house disappointed with the Ministry
[1:44:53] this everything comes Qui we just stay
[1:44:57] there don't go to chairs don't
[1:45:00] Fellowship don't want
[1:45:02] another then one day there was a knock
[1:45:04] in the
[1:45:06] door and it was our pastor he don't ask
[1:45:10] question anything he just I come to pray
[1:45:14] that's all and we are released of that
[1:45:16] bonday just little love will do it true
[1:45:21] we don't know what somebody is suffering
[1:45:23] or what he been through but a little
[1:45:26] word of encouragement amen we just lift
[1:45:29] them up and he help us during the time I
[1:45:33] so
[1:45:34] thankful hallelujah amen God heals by
[1:45:38] love God heals by
[1:45:40] prayer and we know that prayer always is
[1:45:43] the most powerful weapon along the Earth
[1:45:47] powerful than nuclear amen amen God
[1:45:50] heals by Miracle God heals by his word
[1:45:54] and God
[1:45:55] heals
[1:45:56] Hallelujah God heals by his word and we
[1:45:59] as Gentile healed by just the spoken
[1:46:01] word of
[1:46:03] God whatever Source it is God heals by
[1:46:07] it God Is A Healer yes he is and we
[1:46:11] don't know how his ways to heal it but
[1:46:15] we know he is a
[1:46:17] Healer we don't need to see his acts
[1:46:21] according to our interpretation of how
[1:46:22] how he will do it but he has his own way
[1:46:27] and the end it is his name will be
[1:46:29] glorified Among Us that's right I am the
[1:46:32] Lord that Health all thy diseases and it
[1:46:34] was declared I am the Lord that Health

[1:47:14] Christ are placed there by God to bring
[1:47:16] healing to other portion of the body by
[1:47:18] the way how God made that Ministry to
[1:47:21] cares for others and this ministry it
[1:47:24] doesn't mean that it's only the
[1:47:26] five-fold
[1:47:28] ministry we as the body of Jesus Christ

[1:48:59] Thanksgiving let your request be made
[1:49:02] known unto God hold
