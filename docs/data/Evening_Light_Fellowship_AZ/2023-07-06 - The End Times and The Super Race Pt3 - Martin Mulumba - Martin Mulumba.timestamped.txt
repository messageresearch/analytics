[12:44] believe that
[12:46] oh God still learns
[12:54] in the
[12:56] hearts of his people
[13:00] God you
[13:03] [Music]
[13:06] 'll meet us
[13:08] [Applause]
[13:09] [Music]
[13:19] [Music]
[13:23] [Applause]
[13:25] oh God still
[13:28] [Applause]
[13:31] amen amen greet you all in the name of
[13:34] the Lord just to pledge pleasure and a
[13:36] privilege to be here to our streamers
[13:39] and our online audience pray the Lord to
[13:40] bless you for all those traveling we
[13:43] pray the Lord will be with them
[13:45] I'm just going to ask brother Ezra page
[13:47] if he would come and take these the
[13:49] needs here in a moment we have a praise
[13:51] report
[13:52] sister Rebecca page has been released
[13:54] from the hospital today
[13:56] and brother Ron says praise the Lord for
[13:58] his mercies and Grace and his healing
[13:59] virtues amen we're thankful for that
[14:06] and then just we want to continue to
[14:08] remember her in prayer as she's on the
[14:11] men that the Lord would just give her
[14:13] strength just continue to heal her we
[14:16] know
[14:17] sounds cliche but the Lord has the final
[14:19] say Amen
[14:22] sister Nancy has a prayer request she
[14:24] said I'm asking for traveling mercies
[14:26] for a trip to Pennsylvania this
[14:29] Wednesday
[14:30] she also has three unspoken requests so
[14:33] I want to remember those sister Jennifer
[14:35] Dubose has an unspoken prayer request
[14:39] you know brother Robert had given me a
[14:41] prayer request here that Ben Megan and
[14:43] Josiah got home I believe it was Tuesday
[14:45] and they're just trying to get
[14:47] reacclimated after the trip I'm sure
[14:49] that's a real challenge to travel under
[14:52] the circumstances and so we pray the
[14:54] Lord just be with them just be their
[14:56] comfort and be their stealing power just
[14:59] to calm and just it's what he does
[15:01] friends he just brings peace and that he
[15:04] just continued to touch little Josiah
[15:06] and lift him up and uh just remember
[15:09] little Theo he has a treatment next
[15:11] Tuesdays his next treatment and uh has
[15:13] another eye exam there's still some
[15:15] concern for his eye and uh just seeking
[15:18] the mind of the Lord for an additional
[15:20] possible treatment that would be every
[15:22] two weeks is pretty non-invasive but it
[15:25] still is a form of chemo so these
[15:28] decisions seem easy to make until it's
[15:29] your child and so we do it prayerfully
[15:33] we committed to the Lord knowing that
[15:35] God works through medicine we trust that
[15:38] he placed the right team of doctors
[15:39] around Theo's condition and I've been a
[15:42] little scarce here and just the sickness
[15:44] is going through and a little something
[15:46] went through the family and just trying
[15:47] to protect him as a father I believe
[15:50] that's my responsibility to make the
[15:52] right calls from a family so just keep
[15:55] charity and prayer twos and just being
[15:57] The Keeper of the home there with the
[15:59] with the little ones and pray you just
[16:01] keep us in your prayers we do covet
[16:03] through prayers
[16:05] um any of those traveling once again I
[16:07] know there's a lot of Saints on the road
[16:08] right now it's that time of year and we
[16:10] just want the Lord to keep him safe the
[16:12] highways and highways are pretty crazy

[45:18] the Lord
[45:22] [Music]
[45:27] Heavenly Father
[45:29] we truly desire your spirit to move once
[45:33] again tonight
[45:34] to fill our whole being
[45:37] to make us sanctuaries
[45:39] where you are pleased to dwell within
[45:42] father
[45:43] in this day look for a god of great
[45:47] Darkness
[45:48] but you chose a place where you can find
[45:51] and abide loan
[45:53] it's right that you are cleansing day
[45:55] and night
[45:57] you are strengthening and feeling low
[45:59] far and giving low faraga materials to
[46:03] understand the time in which we are
[46:05] living in fathers because without love
[46:08] for the god you nearby us we would be no
[46:11] father God roaming around and like low
[46:15] faraga Ship Without a shepherd and being
[46:18] led astray to slaughter father
[46:20] but it is a privilege unto us today to
[46:24] be standing low father God in thy
[46:27] presence knowing it's not by might not
[46:30] by power by by the spirit as Lord father
[46:33] God we wait upon thy presence once again
[46:37] tonight may you attempt to be sick may
[46:40] you heal or father God may you look for
[46:43] a God to strengthen those who are
[46:45] discouraged may you love father God
[46:49] [Music]
[46:52] for Revelation Lord because Lord has the
[46:56] time goes by the moral of our God we are
[47:00] to be closer to you may you father God
[47:02] open that word unto us once again
[47:04] tonight as we look away unto you with
[47:07] Thanksgiving in Jesus Christ's name amen
[47:12] may God bless you once again tonight
[47:15] it is a privilege to be in the house of
[47:20] the Lord
[47:21] as well we are still standing will take
[47:25] The Book of Luke we still in that same
[47:29] part
[47:30] believe we're going to dwell upon it a
[47:32] little bit a little longer because
[47:35] the words of Jesus packs a little bit
[47:37] too much into it
[47:39] as described would say that many things
[47:41] that Jesus did are not all written but
[47:45] we believe by the key given to us in
[47:47] this last day we are able to stretch out
[47:50] what we're is uh within the word
[47:54] Luke 22 chapter Luke chapter 22 verse 24
[47:57] to 30 and then I'll have you be seated
[48:04] and there was also a Strife among them
[48:07] meaning the disciples which of them
[48:10] should be accounted the greatest and he
[48:12] said unto them the kings of the Gentiles
[48:15] exercise a lot of sheep over them and
[48:19] they that exercise Authority upon them
[48:22] are called benefactors but ye shall not
[48:25] be so but he that is greatest among you
[48:29] let him be as the younger and he that is
[48:33] Chief has he that does serve
[48:38] amen may the Lord bless you you may be
[48:41] seated
[48:43] uh once again I would like to thank
[48:46] brother Ron for the trust and the
[48:50] privilege to the opportunity and
[48:52] privilege to stand here uh to keep
[48:57] developing the title that we've been
[49:01] talking about for the last three parts
[49:04] the end times and the super race
[49:07] we have seen so far in the last two
[49:09] Services uh Department of the Gentile
[49:13] nations in the end times where we saw
[49:16] Nimrod being
[49:20] the type of Lucifer the type of the
[49:24] devil who had ideas that he taught to be
[49:30] the heir of the earth and he had the
[49:33] things that he wanted to accomplish he
[49:36] wanted to make a demo for himself he
[49:40] wanted to build a strong Nation he
[49:43] wanted to build his own religion and as
[49:48] we went about we saw that even in his
[49:52] religion he took the people one step at
[49:56] a time away from the true uh previous
[49:59] worship that was the relationship
[50:02] between God and Men
[50:04] and as you went along his desire was to
[50:08] be worshiped and you want to be
[50:10] worshiped and by people looking at him
[50:12] because as long as he still wish being
[50:16] worshiped just by
[50:18] having an idea of thinking that the
[50:21] devil is an ideal a spirit out there is
[50:24] not fulfilled if that desire is not
[50:26] fulfilled yet and we saw that
[50:30] um as he goes about time and time after
[50:33] time it took the People by dividing the
[50:36] land and bringing culture languages from
[50:39] one continent and we could then we have
[50:42] countries then we have a series then we
[50:45] have streets and and on and on and on
[50:49] by Within every country we see that
[50:53] people have their own religion you'll
[50:56] see that you know the religion of the
[50:58] whites the religion of the black people
[51:00] the religion of uh of the ancestors and
[51:04] all these things the devil was just
[51:06] taking the people one step at a time to
[51:09] bring them to worship Him and people but
[51:12] then over time people since they were
[51:14] taken away from the presence of God they
[51:16] started leave building by those
[51:19] principles day after day they think like
[51:21] oh we are Americans we are Africans we
[51:24] Congolese we're French and we we
[51:26] Filipinos and we're Chinese and all
[51:29] these things it took a little bit of
[51:31] time and people became proud of it it's
[51:34] like you know where are you from oh I'm
[51:36] from Africa are you Congolese yes I am
[51:38] like proud of it you know but then that
[51:41] was an agenda that the devil had but
[51:43] then when God created uh the men and
[51:46] women he said for multiply and dominate
[51:50] upon the Earth he didn't tell them go
[51:52] out there and divide the land and become
[51:54] looking at each other on the basis of
[51:58] race and on the basis of money and on
[52:01] the basis of all these things but then
[52:04] glory be to God that God also wanted to
[52:07] restore that Fellowship because the
[52:10] fellowship had was taken away people
[52:12] didn't really know what they were
[52:13] worshiping but then the Lord also had to
[52:16] stop working in a way way to bring
[52:19] people back but then the first
[52:21] revelation that we find that amen when
[52:24] it comes to God the first of all
[52:26] Revelation is the revelation of Jesus
[52:28] Christ because he is revealing himself
[52:31] to you for this real the only purpose to
[52:35] bring that back that relationship
[52:38] between God and us
[52:40] and as the men were coming about the
[52:43] devil knew that he also had the work to
[52:46] do he knew that there was uh God was
[52:49] sending out prophets and when the
[52:51] prophets were coming they were bringing
[52:53] the people back to the line and bringing
[52:56] the word and people will look at it it's
[52:58] like oh glory be to God but the devil
[53:01] was not satisfied because if we only had
[53:04] a group of people that we call
[53:06] Christians it's very easy but then the
[53:09] devil had to come among the Believers to
[53:12] try not to infiltrate them and to be
[53:15] able to overcome them because he wants
[53:17] because I believe in Isaiah Isaiah he
[53:20] said he wanted to lift himself above the
[53:23] stars of God because he was he could
[53:27] have had the rest of the two-thirds of
[53:29] the Angels but it was not satisfied
[53:31] one-third of them was not under his
[53:33] control and he wanted still to go and
[53:36] get them
[53:37] therefore
[53:39] that's why even after all these years
[53:42] that uh prophets were going for to
[53:46] Israel and and stuff and you still find
[53:49] that the disciples as we just read they
[53:52] wanted to see who was the greatest among
[53:54] them they wanted to see like you know
[53:56] among us we all do uh this and we do
[54:00] that and stuff but who is who is the
[54:04] greatest Among Us is it the pastor is it
[54:07] the the the one that clings so do we
[54:10] have to build a hierarchy of people
[54:12] where some people are more important
[54:15] than others but then God looks at them
[54:18] and said I said no you shall not be so
[54:20] those are the things of the Gentiles
[54:22] because people under the Dominion of the
[54:25] devil because it made you fall is the
[54:27] devil told God they all told Jesus like
[54:29] you know all these nations belong to me
[54:32] so Jesus tells them like you know no you
[54:35] shall not be so because if any one of
[54:38] you be the greatest let him be as the
[54:43] little one
[54:44] if you think that you are the greatest
[54:46] ever of them all be the one who served
[54:50] the most
[54:50] but then in the society that we live in
[54:54] serving is not in the it's not a place
[54:57] people have to serve me people have to
[55:00] worship me people have to recognize me I
[55:04] want to do what I want to do for my own
[55:06] best
[55:07] not for the best of God's kingdom but
[55:10] then our individual mindset once Aikido
[55:14] I want to do it for my own I'm doing
[55:16] this because I want to be happy for
[55:18] myself but then Jesus started drawing a
[55:21] different picture
[55:22] and as he's drawing a different picture
[55:24] people now we understand that these
[55:27] disciples
[55:28] still had a journey to go before
[55:31] receiving the Holy Ghost they had a
[55:33] certain mindset they were living in a
[55:36] certain manner they were thinking in a
[55:37] different ways but then it requires the
[55:40] coming of the Holy Ghost the holy spirit
[55:42] in the people to bring that old nature
[55:46] to note and to build another kingdom
[55:49] because Jesus says in verse 27 for
[55:53] weather is greater he that seed is admit
[55:57] or he that serveth is not he that's
[56:01] either that meat but I am among you as
[56:04] he that service and the year and and ye
[56:09] are they which have continued with me in
[56:12] my Temptation and I appoint you unto you
[56:17] a kingdom
[56:19] is showing them a different walk a
[56:22] different place is pointing them to a
[56:24] whole different realm but then
[56:27] the devil at the same time does not sit
[56:30] quiet and looks at them and say like you
[56:32] know oh Jesus these are your people take
[56:34] them and go with them
[56:36] they say
[56:39] the devil looks at it and understands
[56:41] like hey there's really a lot of work to
[56:44] be done here
[56:45] Paul comes about he started telling the
[56:48] people taking them from the levels where
[56:51] they were being Corinthians and lifting
[56:54] them up one step at a time one step at a
[56:57] time but the devil looks at it they say
[56:59] that uh
[57:01] these people are going too far
[57:04] let me now
[57:05] get to work
[57:07] that's what we'll be talking about today
[57:09] because uh
[57:10] uh last time we went into almost into
[57:13] Genesis 11 and by God's grace if we able
[57:16] to to get to it and uh he'll be
[57:20] wonderful but then by God's grace so to
[57:22] uh draw that line and to show how the
[57:26] prophet shows it so that at least every
[57:29] time that we referencing to these things
[57:31] it's not just based on on the fact that
[57:34] we are in the message
[57:36] because we can still be in the message
[57:38] but when we look what what brother
[57:40] Branham says about even people in the
[57:42] message and stuff it becomes a little
[57:45] bit scary but also joyful to the soul to
[57:49] know that we are so privileged to have
[57:51] this access to this Revelation and not
[57:54] just to be called church members but to
[57:58] be called the true bride of Jesus Christ
[57:59] he will uh it will take all the time
[58:02] that it will take by God's grace because
[58:06] he met me the other day and he was
[58:09] drawing all these things and I was like
[58:11] what are you talking about
[58:12] and but then when you draw it
[58:15] differently then I'm like yes
[58:17] this is so wonderful so by God's grace
[58:20] will take the time that we'll take
[58:21] because I don't want to mix things of
[58:24] what is of the bride and what is going
[58:27] on with uh the devil at the same time I
[58:30] want to keep them separate so that at
[58:32] least uh everything can be uh held in
[58:36] its position so that when we focus on
[58:39] the bride it's on the bride and when we
[58:41] deal with everything else accordingly
[58:43] but God's grace so
[58:46] the devil looking at it
[58:49] he sees that God has sent the first
[58:52] prophet which was uh Paul brother Paul
[58:56] came about and did a wonderful work and
[58:59] lay down the word and started to laid
[59:03] out the pardon and say like he say like
[59:05] you know as a wise master builder have
[59:07] laid down the pattern be wise he that
[59:10] builds upon it but then at the same time
[59:13] those converts
[59:15] because when the Revival comes in the
[59:17] city thousands of people show up I mean
[59:20] media we see that in branham's days
[59:24] 300 000 people in one meeting but look
[59:27] at us today
[59:29] barely we have it we can fill it up
[59:32] Sanctuary with 5 000 people
[59:36] why because there are reasons to it and
[59:39] everything is laid down in the word and
[59:42] as the Lord opens these things up to us
[59:44] it's just so wonderful then it gives
[59:47] courage to the Believers that as we see
[59:52] the pyramid growing
[59:54] the Lesser it is the smaller it is and
[59:58] only the Overcomers will be able to make
[1:00:00] it
[1:00:01] and these Overcomers they have to be
[1:00:04] equipped they have to have the tools
[1:00:07] they have to know to separate because in
[1:00:10] this day the two shall be so much closer
[1:00:14] it will be even harder to separate them
[1:00:17] because even the disciples told Jesus we
[1:00:20] met a guy is not one of us we should
[1:00:23] stop him a second why did you stop him
[1:00:26] because in them already without the Holy
[1:00:29] Spirit they had an organizational
[1:00:31] mindset
[1:00:33] they wanted to start an organization
[1:00:35] right there it's only people of this
[1:00:38] group who has the truth it's only people
[1:00:40] of this church it's only this pastor who
[1:00:42] understands it better oh you see those
[1:00:45] Brothers they don't really have it
[1:00:48] that thing already started among the
[1:00:52] disciples
[1:00:53] and the devil knew that dice that's his
[1:00:57] way
[1:00:58] that when we see all those things
[1:01:00] repeating again in this day we need to
[1:01:03] go back to the pattern we need to go
[1:01:06] back to the world in order for us to
[1:01:08] understand exactly what is taking place
[1:01:10] and what is what we supposed to do
[1:01:14] and as the devil saw that I'm saying uh
[1:01:18] Simeon Church age paragraph 18 but there
[1:01:22] is
[1:01:23] but there's where the Roman Catholic
[1:01:25] Church was formed out of out of a group
[1:01:28] of people that were converts of simple
[1:01:30] and ironus and some Martin and on them
[1:01:34] they were converted Christians
[1:01:36] from paganism
[1:01:38] over to Christianity
[1:01:41] just as we saw last time that the people
[1:01:44] who were
[1:01:46] under this oppression of nimrod
[1:01:49] they had all this Idol worshiping they
[1:01:53] were had all these elements of
[1:01:55] spirits and
[1:01:57] culture and countries and stuff they
[1:02:00] were now converted to Christianity
[1:02:03] and now as they were converted to
[1:02:05] Christianity but wanted to pull the
[1:02:08] church back into the Old Testament form
[1:02:11] of ministry like having high priests
[1:02:14] apostolics a succession like one book to
[1:02:17] another Pope another Pope if we could go
[1:02:20] down and Through the Bible you'd find
[1:02:23] out that that's exactly the truth and
[1:02:25] how God condemned the thing from the
[1:02:28] very beginning and last night church it
[1:02:31] said I hate it
[1:02:34] the Lord saw it from the very beginning
[1:02:38] that the people came from a different
[1:02:40] lifestyle from a different way a way of
[1:02:44] looking at things when they came now
[1:02:47] into Christianity they wanted not to
[1:02:49] bring all the gods and all the cultures
[1:02:53] into Christianity
[1:02:57] despite of all that was given to them
[1:03:01] there's no more Gentiles there's no more
[1:03:04] free man there's no more slave in
[1:03:09] all are in Christ but these people
[1:03:13] tell him about with the very same idea
[1:03:17] and say like uh
[1:03:18] we want to go back
[1:03:21] just as they did in the wilderness they
[1:03:24] say like you know no no no we remember
[1:03:25] where we're eating in Egypt
[1:03:28] this is too boring
[1:03:32] we don't want this like you know there's
[1:03:34] a lot a little bit of a little bit of
[1:03:35] movement out there in Egypt
[1:03:38] let us make us a king do what go back in
[1:03:41] Egypt
[1:03:44] the very same thing and the Lord will
[1:03:47] bring him like the very same thing
[1:03:51] that they were living out there in their
[1:03:54] mind they wanted to have a king over
[1:03:56] them
[1:03:57] they wanted to have a high priest over
[1:04:00] them
[1:04:00] and that's how they never came about
[1:04:03] they say well
[1:04:04] let me get with this unconverted people
[1:04:08] the people who could not who didn't
[1:04:10] believe the whole truth
[1:04:13] the people who didn't give in totally to
[1:04:16] God
[1:04:18] they wanted to have a little bit of
[1:04:20] Christianity
[1:04:22] yet a little bit of beer on the side
[1:04:25] a little bit of Christianity a little
[1:04:28] bit of movie on the side
[1:04:30] because of that the devil finds his way
[1:04:33] in
[1:04:35] the devil find his way in bourbonam says
[1:04:38] in the same message progress 63
[1:04:40] was there a prophecy concerning that you
[1:04:43] remember post prophecy last night I know
[1:04:46] that after my departure
[1:04:49] Grievous wool shall enter in among you
[1:04:52] and Men of your own class they're just
[1:04:56] like us
[1:04:59] but with a powerful thought in the mind
[1:05:02] with a vision in the mind
[1:05:05] people anointed of the devil but they
[1:05:08] just look like any one of us
[1:05:10] they dress like us they talk like us
[1:05:14] but with a certain mind in the in the in
[1:05:16] the uh with a certain idea in the mind
[1:05:19] gracious wolves shall come and shall
[1:05:21] enter in among you and Men of your own
[1:05:23] class right in their own church the
[1:05:27] Roman Catholic Church coming up will
[1:05:29] rise up among you and pull away
[1:05:32] disciples after them
[1:05:36] and Paul's wolf we find out become
[1:05:39] Nicolaitans
[1:05:41] foreign
[1:05:44] they came to church
[1:05:46] the conversion they didn't give
[1:05:48] internally to God
[1:05:51] because of that the word says
[1:05:54] things they did not fully give in to God
[1:05:57] then God sends out the spirit to drive
[1:06:01] them away totally to it
[1:06:04] and these people with what they had in
[1:06:06] the mind with what they wanted to become
[1:06:10] they still wanted to be recognized as
[1:06:12] one of the greatest
[1:06:15] but Jesus said no
[1:06:17] there was a kingdom before this Kingdom
[1:06:19] existed
[1:06:20] and I want to get you back to their
[1:06:23] Kingdom but then before then look at
[1:06:26] what is going to happen what a
[1:06:28] privileged people we could be
[1:06:31] that before the danger comes before
[1:06:34] anything starts taking driving you away
[1:06:37] the Lord shows you this is what is going
[1:06:40] to happen
[1:06:41] so look at what is going to happen now
[1:06:44] it's our job now it's either we are
[1:06:47] truly converted
[1:06:49] truly given unto God or just a halfway
[1:06:54] then by being halfway The Vault find his
[1:06:57] way the devil finds his way into us
[1:07:01] amen
[1:07:03] you see and uh in the same message
[1:07:07] program 76 and this church had to begin
[1:07:10] to have a root of bitterness coming up
[1:07:13] in in them because that that this church
[1:07:17] demand Church the big part the majority
[1:07:21] of them always was hammering against the
[1:07:25] Holy Spirit ruling in the church and
[1:07:28] they wanted to rule themselves
[1:07:30] they wanted to set up a priesthood they
[1:07:34] wanted to act like the Old Testament
[1:07:36] people they wanted priests and they they
[1:07:40] if the Pagan the the pagan gods back
[1:07:44] there where they they was converted they
[1:07:48] had priests and so forth of Jupiter and
[1:07:52] Priests of Venice and so forth they want
[1:07:55] to bring in them same to make these men
[1:08:03] what we saw yesterday that in different
[1:08:06] land a different part of the world
[1:08:08] people bring all kind of religion all
[1:08:11] kind of gods and as we say in India God
[1:08:15] of fertility of of sun of rain and and
[1:08:19] all these things up and the conversion
[1:08:24] when they come they hear the Revival
[1:08:26] coming up what do they want to do they
[1:08:29] want to bring all those Gods now but
[1:08:32] just by converting it
[1:08:35] what was the statue yesterday now he's a
[1:08:37] human being walking
[1:08:41] what was uh just a picture yesterday
[1:08:43] that couldn't talk to them now they have
[1:08:46] a priest that can talk to them now
[1:08:50] but then since they were not converted
[1:08:54] they wanted to be worshiped
[1:08:57] they wanted somebody to come and tell
[1:08:59] them everything they have
[1:09:02] not in the purpose as of in James 5 go
[1:09:06] confess your same to one to another
[1:09:08] but to bring the worship of the devil in
[1:09:12] human flesh
[1:09:16] the same devil
[1:09:17] taking them one step at a time
[1:09:20] showing them like you know don't worry
[1:09:24] it's just a
[1:09:26] God the Father God the the son and God
[1:09:30] the Holy Ghost
[1:09:31] and then they represent it with uh God
[1:09:35] the Father a light
[1:09:37] the son a little baby
[1:09:41] the Holy Ghost a little dove
[1:09:44] that was not enough it brings it down
[1:09:47] okay from one country to another okay
[1:09:50] let's have a Mary a woman
[1:09:53] with Marina with a baby
[1:09:55] from the baby the baby doesn't talk
[1:09:58] let's remove the woman
[1:10:00] let's now we just have the woman help
[1:10:03] Mary Help Mary
[1:10:04] after Hail Mary Mary is almost
[1:10:07] disappearing
[1:10:09] because now he wants now to cup off is
[1:10:14] Eden
[1:10:17] in one of the services we read that that
[1:10:20] he is going to make himself God and he's
[1:10:23] going to do it
[1:10:26] and by doing it he also needs to have
[1:10:28] vehicles
[1:10:30] and converted people in the church
[1:10:33] converts off the message
[1:10:38] that he's going to use as a vehicle to
[1:10:41] drive them from to to fulfill that
[1:10:44] purpose
[1:10:47] say like you know look where they
[1:10:50] started look how they're coming down
[1:10:53] look at what he's doing
[1:10:56] from the Daniel Vision we see that the
[1:11:01] statue of Nebuchadnezzar all the four
[1:11:04] stages all the four kingdoms is the same
[1:11:07] devil coming down one step at a time
[1:11:10] coming down once upon a time so that we
[1:11:13] can look at him one day and say like oh
[1:11:16] this is what we've always looked at we
[1:11:19] always talked about
[1:11:21] that's what he wants to do
[1:11:24] but then at the same time God also must
[1:11:27] also have a people
[1:11:30] that has to be aware of it
[1:11:32] and by becoming aware of the devices of
[1:11:36] the devil then we are more equipped now
[1:11:38] to fight the battle
[1:11:42] because without being aware of the
[1:11:44] devices of the devil then we are just
[1:11:47] swept away because it will look so
[1:11:49] simple
[1:11:51] so honey
[1:11:52] because he's going to get the kingdom by
[1:11:55] flatteries
[1:11:57] you see it's just it's just
[1:12:01] it's just freedom of speech you know
[1:12:03] it's your Liberty you know you can just
[1:12:06] do it yourself you a young girl you
[1:12:09] should you should have fun
[1:12:11] it sounds so simple
[1:12:14] but behind it now it requires now he
[1:12:18] that heareth the word to be able to at
[1:12:21] their own to hold together
[1:12:24] otherwise
[1:12:25] before you know it I was here I was
[1:12:28] praying there's no more prayer then I'm
[1:12:30] I'm going I'm going I'm going but then
[1:12:33] the dev does exactly what he wants to do
[1:12:36] and has he had members now
[1:12:40] he brought them in then they get to uh
[1:12:43] then I see a room and I see him uh the
[1:12:47] Council of Nasir
[1:12:50] as they get there now these unconverted
[1:12:52] people
[1:12:54] they came about
[1:12:56] they were always debate among them
[1:13:00] God the Father
[1:13:02] deity nobody was uh
[1:13:05] there was no understanding among them
[1:13:09] then the devil looks at them like since
[1:13:11] I already have a part of my people in
[1:13:14] the church
[1:13:16] let me bring in now another person to be
[1:13:19] able to achieve the great purpose
[1:13:23] shows us
[1:13:25] the same message paragraph 130 is 113.
[1:13:29] so Constantine with this in his mind to
[1:13:33] strengthen his Empire
[1:13:36] as Rome always did to hold the keys to
[1:13:40] the world he had to bring his Pagan
[1:13:43] ideas and take the Christians ideas and
[1:13:48] somewhat consolidate them together to
[1:13:51] dwell to weld this together and make
[1:13:54] himself an Empire that would be that
[1:13:56] would be second to none see because that
[1:14:00] would make him yell the greatest ruler
[1:14:03] in the world constantly
[1:14:07] what he wanted from the very beginning
[1:14:09] to make a great nation but then when he
[1:14:13] was hit in the
[1:14:15] uh the political Realm
[1:14:17] he wanted not to change it into proper
[1:14:21] room but then how does he do it people
[1:14:25] in the church
[1:14:27] diversion in the terms of vision of
[1:14:30] Revelation and he's come is not come
[1:14:33] revealed not revealed and all these
[1:14:36] things here people in reality they
[1:14:40] wanted to make themselves a name
[1:14:44] because the greater he is as the biggest
[1:14:47] person in the land the biggest the
[1:14:51] highest the most notable preacher they
[1:14:54] know in the surface of the Earth
[1:14:56] to the point they want to become
[1:15:00] taking over from the message of the age
[1:15:06] that same idea
[1:15:08] of being lifted upon above the stars of
[1:15:11] God of becoming The Interpreter of the
[1:15:14] Gods he wants now somebody
[1:15:17] and I'm converted man on the pulpit
[1:15:21] without the ministry in the home without
[1:15:24] the holy spirit in the office without
[1:15:27] the Holy Spirit to now fulfill this
[1:15:30] great agenda
[1:15:33] but now what does he do it takes the man
[1:15:38] the uncoverted man brings in the
[1:15:41] political power and puts it all together
[1:15:44] in order now to achieve that great
[1:15:48] purpose
[1:15:49] and what does it become it becomes then
[1:15:52] the religion of Jezebel
[1:15:54] this religion of Jezebel these
[1:15:57] unconverted people these people who did
[1:16:00] not know what conversion was that's why
[1:16:03] but I'm saying he said you see when
[1:16:05] Billy Graham goes out there he has all
[1:16:07] these big meetings after you a year or
[1:16:11] two he comes about he can't even find 30
[1:16:13] people
[1:16:15] he says but look at Paul what did Paul
[1:16:18] do he tests one man brings him all the
[1:16:21] way to conversion fills him with the
[1:16:23] Holy Spirit then that man is able to go
[1:16:27] out and convert more people
[1:16:29] now we have now another side in the same
[1:16:33] church and people also who were not all
[1:16:36] the time they were given to receive the
[1:16:38] Holy Ghost did not receive the Holy
[1:16:40] Ghost now they start embarking now to
[1:16:43] another agenda
[1:16:46] coming now to church it's not just
[1:16:49] sitting there I come to church I listen
[1:16:51] to the word I'll go back I come back
[1:16:53] early listen to the word I go back no
[1:16:56] there is a purpose
[1:16:58] of coming to church to be filled with
[1:17:01] the Holy Spirit otherwise there's
[1:17:04] another gender where the devil wants to
[1:17:06] possess people to help people under his
[1:17:09] control so that he also can dwell in the
[1:17:12] Phil fill them up just the same way as
[1:17:15] we see with her Judah Judas is carried
[1:17:18] because since he missed he went out
[1:17:21] there did all the great Miracles and
[1:17:24] evangelize and all these things but then
[1:17:26] since he missed
[1:17:28] to receive the Holy Ghost what does the
[1:17:31] Bible say then the devil did what
[1:17:33] entered into him
[1:17:36] the very same agenda when the devil did
[1:17:40] that what did he do did you go to do
[1:17:42] sell the word
[1:17:44] betray the word
[1:17:46] you come to church you listen to the
[1:17:48] word you come to church you listen to
[1:17:49] the world you come to the church you
[1:17:51] then you it becomes common to us
[1:17:54] then it become common it's like well
[1:17:56] I've heard this I know this yeah I know
[1:17:58] that quotation yeah it's it's here yeah
[1:18:00] I know it yeah there's nothing new in
[1:18:02] the message there's nothing you can
[1:18:04] preach me that I can you that I've
[1:18:05] learned exactly then we understand what
[1:18:09] has happened
[1:18:11] amen we understand what has happened but
[1:18:14] then by God's grace God so loved the
[1:18:16] world that he is given his only begotten
[1:18:19] son that he that believeth in him
[1:18:22] believing is turning from your old ways
[1:18:26] into a new way
[1:18:29] that if you believe now you become a new
[1:18:33] Creator creation
[1:18:36] this new creation not made out of men
[1:18:39] men ideas men interpretation men men
[1:18:42] ways of thinking all my culture my
[1:18:45] country my this my this no a new kingdom
[1:18:49] coming down Jesus say I appoint you unto
[1:18:52] a kingdom is it getting you again
[1:18:55] opening another door a place that will
[1:18:58] shut all these years because the
[1:19:00] cherubins were standing there in the
[1:19:02] front of the Tree of Life of the tree of
[1:19:04] life now the door now is open unto us
[1:19:08] for us to go back to the fellowship
[1:19:10] again
[1:19:12] now when you stay outside without being
[1:19:14] filled with the Holy Ghost dead death
[1:19:16] comes in
[1:19:19] and when death comes in quickly you
[1:19:21] start all of a sudden you just start
[1:19:23] feeling that I am better than him
[1:19:26] I am better than she
[1:19:28] she can't tell me anything why because
[1:19:31] that spirit
[1:19:34] that unconvention that your unconvisted
[1:19:37] state
[1:19:38] you're the state of unbelief brings you
[1:19:41] now into the agenda of the devil and
[1:19:44] quickly you have the political views
[1:19:47] and your political views now start like
[1:19:49] drawing lines like you know I don't like
[1:19:51] him he's a Democrat he's a republican
[1:19:53] he's this is that he's a socialist we're
[1:19:56] withstanding socialism oh we don't like
[1:19:58] communism in our country exactly we
[1:20:01] understand where that came from
[1:20:06] the purpose why God is bringing all
[1:20:09] these things around is to Enlighten our
[1:20:11] eyes to give us all these informations
[1:20:14] for us to be aware to be precisely
[1:20:17] understanding like time is coming to the
[1:20:19] end
[1:20:21] it's not a time for us just to roam
[1:20:23] around to say well I'll make this much
[1:20:25] money I still need to do this I say yes
[1:20:27] plant your corn plant your potato but
[1:20:30] have the understanding of the time in
[1:20:33] which we are living in and this is where
[1:20:36] the road now is opening this thing you
[1:20:38] say look how they started they came in
[1:20:41] the church like every one of us but
[1:20:44] since they did not open their heart to
[1:20:46] receive the Holy Ghost they were still
[1:20:48] attached clinging to the cultures to
[1:20:51] their to the denominations and all these
[1:20:54] things to the pastor to the churches now
[1:20:57] he is not the political system to to go
[1:21:00] with you alone
[1:21:02] and here now we have now a political
[1:21:05] system
[1:21:07] uh uh Constantine
[1:21:12] with the unbelievers they come together
[1:21:16] a this agenda now cannot Blossom pretty
[1:21:20] easily
[1:21:21] because since they were had so much
[1:21:24] money
[1:21:25] they had access now to all the
[1:21:28] businesses in the world
[1:21:30] because at this room already had
[1:21:33] experience
[1:21:34] on how to rule the land
[1:21:37] from the time of nimrod
[1:21:40] because that was the agenda now when you
[1:21:43] add that together now with these
[1:21:45] unconverted people what can stop them
[1:21:49] and that's what we call today the
[1:21:51] Catholic Church
[1:21:53] and this Catholic Church is not always
[1:21:55] pointing to what we see out there in
[1:21:57] Rome but when we look in our lives
[1:22:00] the way we're conducting ourselves the
[1:22:03] way the word is open unto us and how we
[1:22:07] all like to hold on to what we like best
[1:22:11] goes the same way as these
[1:22:15] oh we we are the one
[1:22:18] we have the money we have the political
[1:22:21] uh Medias we have all access to
[1:22:24] everything we we say one thing every all
[1:22:28] the world has to follow us
[1:22:30] that's what they had
[1:22:33] that's why they would do it they are
[1:22:35] doing today
[1:22:38] as far as conversion
[1:22:41] Constantine was never converted
[1:22:45] but not a son of God
[1:22:47] and some of them tried to make him it
[1:22:49] wasn't never one thing did ever do that
[1:22:53] he was something like a Christian to me
[1:22:54] so only other uh so honor the one
[1:22:59] offered the Nicole Nico Nicole
[1:23:02] nicolayton churches has to put across
[1:23:06] and as far as anything else he has ever
[1:23:08] done that look like Christianity
[1:23:12] the church was married paragraph 154.
[1:23:16] Christianity that is the needy equation
[1:23:19] side the formal side married to the
[1:23:23] state with Pagan ceremonies
[1:23:26] Pagan ceremony as ceremonies and it was
[1:23:29] the birth of the Catholic church in that
[1:23:33] day
[1:23:37] church is the fact that one person
[1:23:41] who heard the word
[1:23:43] who didn't receive the Holy Ghost
[1:23:46] got now trapped into the realm of
[1:23:49] politics
[1:23:50] and there they are
[1:23:51] that's what we call the Catholic Church
[1:23:56] yet at the same time we also have those
[1:24:00] who withstand that Doctrine
[1:24:04] we have those in the days of their
[1:24:06] messenger received the word believe the
[1:24:10] word converted receive the Holy Spirit
[1:24:12] and now they were positioned
[1:24:16] now they had not to fight that system
[1:24:18] not to get in among them
[1:24:22] because the word says how come the rules
[1:24:26] came in because we lowered the standards
[1:24:30] because we didn't keep the word to the
[1:24:33] standard what we're supposed to keep it
[1:24:35] at
[1:24:36] because the prayer life was lowered
[1:24:40] because coming to church was lowered
[1:24:42] because paying our tithe was lowered
[1:24:45] all those still those elements in every
[1:24:49] every one of us we can look at it and
[1:24:51] say
[1:24:53] this can be a dull
[1:24:56] for the devil to get it
[1:24:59] because if you don't pay tithe today
[1:25:01] tomorrow you'll feel guilty
[1:25:03] but then if you don't recover from it
[1:25:05] then you start getting used to it
[1:25:08] then you start getting used to it the
[1:25:10] more you start getting used to it then
[1:25:12] becomes normal for you not to pay
[1:25:14] and now since you can pay it into your
[1:25:17] tithes and God doesn't bless you anymore
[1:25:19] then you have to find another job to
[1:25:21] fill up all the bills that you couldn't
[1:25:23] pay anymore
[1:25:26] that's how the devil works
[1:25:29] because when God established the tithe
[1:25:33] it said it is for you to be blessed
[1:25:38] but then when you stop now that God now
[1:25:41] has the free Liberty to let the devil
[1:25:43] come and take what you have
[1:25:45] and now with our own political mind we
[1:25:49] want to start now teaching God how to do
[1:25:51] it
[1:25:52] well
[1:25:54] I have 20 000. back pay for the tights
[1:25:57] well
[1:25:58] let me first get another job
[1:26:02] pay my bills first
[1:26:04] then I'll get back to it before you say
[1:26:07] it you know they said it's 50 000 you
[1:26:09] back pay of tight
[1:26:13] and at the end of the day then you're
[1:26:15] just going to give up
[1:26:17] because it's unbearable
[1:26:20] because when people file for bankruptcy
[1:26:22] it's because like you know they've
[1:26:23] looked into all the math they could do
[1:26:25] it's like hey I just give up
[1:26:29] it's the same pattern right and now
[1:26:33] when we look at it now these people now
[1:26:35] the Catholic church or these Believers
[1:26:38] or these unconverted people
[1:26:42] 139 it looked it looked good because
[1:26:46] there was rich and so forth and he gave
[1:26:49] at this great meeting when he called
[1:26:52] together Constantine gave the Bishops
[1:26:54] nice buildings it got a hold of some
[1:26:58] money and all these big places like
[1:27:00] buildings it gave these over to the
[1:27:03] church
[1:27:04] that they could use uh use as a church
[1:27:07] houses
[1:27:08] oh they were nice buildings all dressed
[1:27:12] up and so forth he gave them over to the
[1:27:16] church besides that it dressed them up
[1:27:18] and all these things
[1:27:20] 141 oh you can imagine how the Pagan
[1:27:24] said well I can go for that there is
[1:27:28] somebody that somebody can speak back to
[1:27:30] us we've been talking to an idol but
[1:27:33] this man can speak back to us after they
[1:27:36] have received all these buildings
[1:27:38] received all these churches make all
[1:27:40] this money they have experience now
[1:27:43] what was the statue now become a human
[1:27:48] you go to a doctor
[1:27:49] he can tell you exactly what you need
[1:27:53] you don't need prayer meetings anymore
[1:27:57] you don't need healing anymore of course
[1:27:59] God also heals using doctors and stuff
[1:28:03] but the condition that we are blessing
[1:28:06] here is somebody in the state
[1:28:09] in unconverted human being
[1:28:12] a person that came to the world
[1:28:15] that listen to the word
[1:28:18] but now has turned away from God now to
[1:28:21] become a new Creator creation under the
[1:28:25] devil
[1:28:26] with a lot of money with with the state
[1:28:30] behind with all that experience now they
[1:28:33] become now a new a new a new church
[1:28:36] they become the biggest of your own
[1:28:39] at times when you look at some of those
[1:28:41] churches not to name them when they have
[1:28:44] uh campaigns and stuff you look at
[1:28:46] millions of them
[1:28:49] they speak about like you know oh every
[1:28:52] Sunday we have about 50 000 attendees on
[1:28:55] one service morning service and evening
[1:28:57] service we have people streaming and
[1:29:00] they've turned out the the the the
[1:29:02] prayer meetings into into a customer
[1:29:05] service line you want us to pray for you
[1:29:07] call this number
[1:29:11] I am telling you these are things that I
[1:29:13] tell you are happening out there
[1:29:16] you can talk don't worry who can chat
[1:29:22] we can send you a prayer note
[1:29:25] we can send you a holy water
[1:29:28] we can we can have the bird the the the
[1:29:31] priests come visit you if you just pay
[1:29:34] ten thousand dollars
[1:29:37] look at where they started they heard
[1:29:39] the word
[1:29:41] but one step at a time it does started
[1:29:43] taking them away fire and farther far
[1:29:46] away from God
[1:29:48] and when all this now they're
[1:29:50] accumulating all this much money now
[1:29:53] money now had not did not turn money
[1:29:56] into the state of uh into a a standard
[1:30:00] of spirituality
[1:30:03] how come you serving God and you're
[1:30:05] suffering like this job tell us you are
[1:30:08] you you are how did they say it you are
[1:30:11] a secret sinner
[1:30:15] how come you are you you said that you
[1:30:17] worship God and you you you're not
[1:30:19] making it
[1:30:22] why because they started somewhere the
[1:30:25] turn now like you know the whole the
[1:30:27] whole world
[1:30:29] the whole world
[1:30:31] we need money I need to work for money I
[1:30:33] need money I need money I need money
[1:30:38] money now has become now even a trap to
[1:30:42] those who have it and to those who do
[1:30:44] not have it
[1:30:46] for those who have it they don't want to
[1:30:48] lose it and they have to do all the
[1:30:50] means necessary for them to keep
[1:30:52] accumulating the money
[1:30:54] and to those who do not have it they
[1:30:56] will do anything to get the money
[1:31:00] because now society looks at them ends
[1:31:03] of like you know when you have money
[1:31:05] that's what makes you a good a good man
[1:31:08] an honorable man
[1:31:11] but Abraham says uh in a second sale I
[1:31:14] believe one paragraph 153 is that like
[1:31:16] somebody will come and and pay and bills
[1:31:19] the church and and is then is that you
[1:31:23] want now to start leading things
[1:31:25] according to his views
[1:31:29] oh it's because he's the one who gives
[1:31:32] us the good money is the one who who has
[1:31:36] the the big check
[1:31:37] watch out
[1:31:40] watch out
[1:31:42] quite often even with whether with
[1:31:44] ministers
[1:31:46] I'll go preach there because they pay me
[1:31:48] good
[1:31:49] I'll go there because they have a
[1:31:51] basement a good check at the end of the
[1:31:52] service
[1:31:54] of course
[1:31:55] they've turned use the ministry that God
[1:31:58] has given them
[1:31:59] now it means for them to make themselves
[1:32:02] a lot of money why a non-converted man
[1:32:05] because he came to the ministry because
[1:32:07] he wanted money
[1:32:10] just as I was uh I I had a friend in the
[1:32:13] uh back in the days in the Congo he said
[1:32:16] like if this country this country
[1:32:18] nothing is working I think the best way
[1:32:21] the easiest way to to make money is just
[1:32:23] to open a church
[1:32:25] of course because you come to church
[1:32:27] they tell you like see the seed the seed
[1:32:29] the seed seed God is going to bless you
[1:32:31] oh another one say oh there's a brother
[1:32:35] here he was to he was about to pay your
[1:32:38] his rent God tells you God tells you
[1:32:40] take that money and give it to me
[1:32:44] all kind of playground of kind of mental
[1:32:48] kind of things why because men were
[1:32:50] unconverted and they had to use all the
[1:32:54] means necessary to get that money and
[1:32:57] from the money they get now they're the
[1:32:59] goals now to dominate all the world
[1:33:03] they'll go from one country to another
[1:33:05] and say oh we have the money we are the
[1:33:07] country who have the money we're going
[1:33:09] to develop you
[1:33:12] develop
[1:33:15] without the word
[1:33:18] because development is to take people
[1:33:20] from one state to another
[1:33:26] just like a brother saying but you came
[1:33:29] here saying that we were pagans
[1:33:32] and you made us dress the way we
[1:33:34] dressing how come when we come to your
[1:33:37] countries we find women naked just the
[1:33:41] way as we were before yesterday
[1:33:45] but the idea they had behind was not to
[1:33:49] convert the people was not to develop
[1:33:51] the people but they came with flatteries
[1:33:54] to get all the wealth
[1:33:56] to accumulate all the money
[1:34:00] and by accumulating all this money the
[1:34:04] people now said like you know look at
[1:34:07] the Beast
[1:34:08] who can be like the Beast
[1:34:11] you have to be have a degree you need
[1:34:14] you need to go to the School the best
[1:34:16] school in the land
[1:34:18] because these ones with the schools they
[1:34:21] made the biggest schools they made the
[1:34:24] biggest money
[1:34:26] you finish on one of those schools you
[1:34:29] can get the best pay out there
[1:34:33] but then without Holy Spirit
[1:34:35] you see a woman you see a brother you
[1:34:37] see a man
[1:34:38] takes the job
[1:34:40] quickly
[1:34:41] she becomes boastful
[1:34:44] I'm the one who is paying the Mind here
[1:34:47] you don't respect me I'm going to
[1:34:50] divorce you
[1:34:51] without being converted
[1:34:54] all the blessings all that beauty
[1:34:56] becomes a curse
[1:35:00] it becomes a curse and by it becoming a
[1:35:03] curse
[1:35:05] the Lord said no
[1:35:08] I can't live it as such
[1:35:11] I can leave it as such because the Lord
[1:35:14] knows that you know if I keep I leave
[1:35:17] these things coming going forward
[1:35:19] the young people when they grow
[1:35:22] everything they think in their mind what
[1:35:24] you want to become I want to become like
[1:35:26] that
[1:35:27] that Idol
[1:35:29] I want to become like the idol what do
[1:35:32] you want to become I want to become like
[1:35:33] the idol
[1:35:34] don't you want to become a preacher ah
[1:35:37] preachers are boring they always
[1:35:40] consecrating and praying and we don't
[1:35:43] have fun we don't travel as much as we
[1:35:46] like to why that's what Society is
[1:35:50] showing them
[1:35:52] that's what the unconverted people
[1:35:55] turn the world
[1:35:57] and picture it everywhere in the phones
[1:36:00] on the TV at school and everywhere they
[1:36:03] go they show them like this is what
[1:36:05] beauty looks like
[1:36:08] the American Idols
[1:36:11] everywhere you go American Idols
[1:36:13] American Idols
[1:36:16] but this is not really short you know
[1:36:19] but in the mind
[1:36:22] it's not that she wants to cover herself
[1:36:25] but she wants to look like the American
[1:36:28] Idol that she saw there
[1:36:31] it's covering
[1:36:33] but watch out the question is are you
[1:36:36] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:36:38] are you converted
[1:36:40] because after receiving the Holy Spirit
[1:36:43] brother when I'm saying that those
[1:36:45] Africans
[1:36:47] after hearing the word themselves nobody
[1:36:50] told them they went and veiled
[1:36:52] themselves
[1:36:54] covered themselves after covering
[1:36:57] themselves why because they received the
[1:36:59] Holy Ghost
[1:37:00] but then how come you with the message
[1:37:02] with the word day after day your
[1:37:06] dressing is just going Australian
[1:37:08] Australian astray
[1:37:11] the Lord now sees it and understand like
[1:37:14] look at this spirit
[1:37:16] look at where you have shown and fall
[1:37:18] short from look at where that's going to
[1:37:21] take you
[1:37:22] we have seen it in the churches
[1:37:25] people sitting in the pews before you
[1:37:28] know it they on the street doing all
[1:37:30] kinds of things that you know
[1:37:32] but then the time has come the Lord said
[1:37:34] we need to come back
[1:37:38] we need to come back
[1:37:39] I know many times that we can find
[1:37:41] ourselves in all kinds of things and
[1:37:43] left and right but then as long as you
[1:37:46] can hear his voice
[1:37:48] harder not your heart
[1:37:51] by opening your heart now the Lord now
[1:37:53] opens a way for you now to come back to
[1:37:57] that fellowship and this Fellowship will
[1:38:00] get us through the position where we can
[1:38:02] understand exactly what are we supposed
[1:38:05] to do
[1:38:06] and as
[1:38:09] bug of 259 when they fixed up to this
[1:38:12] big thing they did the the the they
[1:38:15] mixed up the church and and the politics
[1:38:18] that was uh that was the birth of
[1:38:19] post-millennium because the church had
[1:38:22] gotten so rich it was rich as it could
[1:38:25] be
[1:38:26] and it was and what it was and it was
[1:38:30] what powerful
[1:38:32] it was over the state the stage and the
[1:38:36] church together
[1:38:37] you see they became that
[1:38:42] powerful
[1:38:43] when we look at it it is powerful
[1:38:47] the Catholic Church it is powerful as
[1:38:50] the prophet says like you know
[1:38:52] the president of of the United States is
[1:38:55] Big here probably big in other countries
[1:38:57] but it's nothing in Rome
[1:39:01] the president of Russia is Big out there
[1:39:05] but in Rome is nothing
[1:39:10] this is the men
[1:39:12] this is the church that sits upon the
[1:39:15] waters
[1:39:16] so many people so many nations
[1:39:20] how does he do it
[1:39:22] by taking the unbelievers
[1:39:25] taking the political system
[1:39:27] putting them together and there it is he
[1:39:31] can now govern the world
[1:39:34] time is up but I wanted to to get into
[1:39:37] um
[1:39:39] the political systems
[1:39:41] with this political systems
[1:39:44] is going to
[1:39:46] lay down
[1:39:48] all these ways of leading the world so
[1:39:52] so that at the end of it
[1:39:55] he can bring everyone else under the
[1:39:59] same religion
[1:40:01] so that you cannot buy you cannot sell
[1:40:04] without having what the mark
[1:40:09] look at where you started very he didn't
[1:40:12] see he didn't look like something very
[1:40:15] uh to strike the eye
[1:40:18] but it was very simple
[1:40:20] just very subtle to look at it to say
[1:40:23] well you know the devil is not really
[1:40:25] there's nothing to this I'm proud and
[1:40:28] I'm Congolese I'm Mexican I'm Nigerian
[1:40:31] and all of these things
[1:40:32] but then it started leading now to go
[1:40:35] quickly before before I close
[1:40:39] that this political system
[1:40:44] they started
[1:40:47] we have most of the most known ones
[1:40:50] the fascism
[1:40:55] socialism
[1:40:57] capitalism
[1:41:00] all these systems
[1:41:03] with tools
[1:41:04] put in the end of the devil
[1:41:07] in order to achieve a purpose
[1:41:10] because with the political system now we
[1:41:13] have political parties
[1:41:15] which one are you democrat Republican
[1:41:20] you see that so this Devil by using that
[1:41:24] as a trap
[1:41:26] to govern the world
[1:41:28] to govern the country and look to people
[1:41:31] like this is really not something
[1:41:34] but it was one of his ways remember
[1:41:37] Constantine a man a politician came and
[1:41:41] joined the church from this church now
[1:41:44] they become powerful from becoming
[1:41:47] powerful now they can now lead the
[1:41:50] entire world
[1:41:51] but then remember in the time of Ahab we
[1:41:55] had what Jezebel behind the back the
[1:41:58] church but who had this uh this Ahab
[1:42:03] behold before the people the politician
[1:42:06] the unconverted man sitting there
[1:42:08] signing the papers but the one dictating
[1:42:11] the agenda is the woman behind
[1:42:16] and by her by him being in the front
[1:42:19] line we only see like he's Mr the
[1:42:21] president no he's not the president the
[1:42:23] president is the one behind it
[1:42:29] because you may see her
[1:42:32] that's my wife no she is the boss
[1:42:41] you say that by her being behind she's
[1:42:45] leading the way she's controlling
[1:42:50] she's the woman
[1:42:52] she stands there she's firm she has the
[1:42:55] eye in temperament
[1:42:57] she is the dominating female
[1:43:01] she is the one bruising everything in
[1:43:03] his way
[1:43:05] she's the one when she takes power you
[1:43:08] can feel that hey nobody can move here
[1:43:12] why because that these were unconverted
[1:43:16] people
[1:43:18] you give somebody without the Holy
[1:43:21] Spirit you give them power you give them
[1:43:24] money that's the end of it all is going
[1:43:27] to walk upon everybody
[1:43:29] there's no respect to nobody
[1:43:32] but then with the Holy Spirit despite of
[1:43:34] all that we can have we are still
[1:43:37] servants
[1:43:38] we are still using all that Authority in
[1:43:42] humility
[1:43:43] that's where we see brother Branham
[1:43:45] could show us he said like you know you
[1:43:47] see sit very quiet the holy spirit is
[1:43:50] very timid
[1:43:51] but these ones here they go in the land
[1:43:54] we go you're going to do what we tell
[1:43:57] you if you don't if don't allow the
[1:44:01] homosexuals in your countries we're not
[1:44:03] going to give you money anymore why
[1:44:06] because that's the agenda from the very
[1:44:09] beginning
[1:44:11] that's the agenda we see that in the
[1:44:14] countries in the continents in every
[1:44:16] single stage in every single country in
[1:44:19] the world
[1:44:20] but God grace we're going to get into
[1:44:22] those political things I had so much but
[1:44:25] but time goes by as he leads but but
[1:44:28] God's grace we're going to get to it
[1:44:29] because the Lord has to come down
[1:44:33] has to see what they are doing what they
[1:44:36] are building what are they building how
[1:44:38] did they come to build it
[1:44:41] they go and they put they play with
[1:44:43] policies and
[1:44:45] principle and interest compound the
[1:44:47] interest by the time you you realize you
[1:44:50] don't understand the formula they
[1:44:52] calculated the interest all the money
[1:44:54] that you're paying on the mortgage it
[1:44:56] only goes to the bank before when you
[1:44:58] fall you fall to one payment or two they
[1:45:00] kick you out all the value all the money
[1:45:02] that you paid to the house is gone now
[1:45:05] you're homeless man
[1:45:07] why but flatteries they acquired the
[1:45:10] land
[1:45:12] and when they acquire the land is not to
[1:45:15] have you
[1:45:16] Remain the question
[1:45:18] but to get you to work more so you can
[1:45:21] pay more you pay all your bills and by
[1:45:24] paying all the bills there you are one
[1:45:27] step at a time there you are you are far
[1:45:30] away from God
[1:45:31] but I believe but God's grace with uh
[1:45:34] this little thought that I was about to
[1:45:35] be where I was able to bring out that
[1:45:37] you're able to see the importance on how
[1:45:41] what the devil is doing and how is it
[1:45:44] doing it bringing the people a little
[1:45:46] bit one step away from the presence of
[1:45:48] God
[1:45:49] by telling them like you know no we have
[1:45:52] the money we have all the resources of
[1:45:55] the world
[1:45:56] and by having all the resources of the
[1:45:58] world
[1:45:59] that's the to your third seal
[1:46:02] this hotel goes there
[1:46:05] they manipulate the economies
[1:46:08] today you wake up like you know oh it's
[1:46:10] good and now it's inflation how come
[1:46:12] it's this inflation some people are
[1:46:14] getting rich and richer
[1:46:16] because of that system
[1:46:19] that political system
[1:46:21] but then also at the same time God knows
[1:46:23] that he has to provide guidance to his
[1:46:25] own that despite of all that you have to
[1:46:28] fight
[1:46:30] because when you fight when you know how
[1:46:32] to fight we'll get to where they at the
[1:46:34] appointed time
[1:46:35] that when you have you're able to fight
[1:46:37] then you have the Victory and the
[1:46:40] Victory there's a reward and that reward
[1:46:42] is not just you come to church and you
[1:46:44] say to say well we'll hear about it
[1:46:46] we're not a good sermon and then we move
[1:46:49] on and on and on and on no
[1:46:52] but when you listen to the word Lord
[1:46:54] open these things in my life because
[1:46:57] that's the most important part of it
[1:46:59] because we can talk like you know Russia
[1:47:01] United States Africa Asia all these
[1:47:05] people out there but then when you miss
[1:47:07] it in your own life that's why the devil
[1:47:10] will catch you from
[1:47:12] because when you're able to see that
[1:47:14] Revelation in your life Lord open my
[1:47:17] understanding
[1:47:18] to see these things in my own life
[1:47:20] because when I see it in my own life
[1:47:22] then I'm able to overcome probably like
[1:47:25] the things that I love to I love to see
[1:47:27] the things that I like I like to to
[1:47:29] listen to will always push me to one
[1:47:33] more of those things one more of those
[1:47:35] things and those things will stray me
[1:47:37] from your presence but then with the
[1:47:39] Revelation with by praying then we are
[1:47:41] able now to go back to those places and
[1:47:45] say like Lord you need to address this
[1:47:47] element
[1:47:48] because those of time of old they
[1:47:52] overcome Not By Their Own Strength but
[1:47:54] by the your spirit
[1:47:56] amen shall we pray
[1:47:59] Heavenly Father
[1:48:01] once again so grateful Lord to
[1:48:05] I've been in thy presence and
[1:48:08] time went by so fast without realizing
[1:48:11] that by your grace you bring out your
[1:48:14] god what is necessary
[1:48:16] as Lord you had shown it Lord beforehand
[1:48:20] how he's going to be and the time that
[1:48:23] is going to take father may you lead us
[1:48:27] Lord Jesus Christ by bringing out the
[1:48:30] Revelation because without Revelation
[1:48:32] father we are unable or father God to do
[1:48:35] anything Lord because what you said
[1:48:38] through thy Prophet Lord that God give
[1:48:41] us life prevailing Revelation because
[1:48:43] Lord this is a good courage and a good
[1:48:47] strength for us to walk along the way
[1:48:49] may you bless Lord father God the
[1:48:51] recipient that even myself Lord to open
[1:48:54] it even more to Enlighten it even more
[1:48:57] father because Lord the time after time
[1:49:00] when you look into this we understand
[1:49:02] that it becomes more clearing over time
[1:49:05] Lord but Lord by your grace and mercy
[1:49:08] may you guide us Lord father God by your
[1:49:10] mercy and bless your children and attend
[1:49:13] to the needs in different places they
[1:49:15] say those who are
[1:49:17] father when they can hear Lord that you
[1:49:20] are the one that can heal the Lord is
[1:49:22] not relying upon doctors and and people
[1:49:26] out there who have went to school but
[1:49:28] relying upon your promise Lord we want
[1:49:31] to see your father God moving Among Us
[1:49:34] the Lord father God the Josiah may you
[1:49:36] know father God be with him Lord may you
[1:49:39] be with our brother Neil Lord Jesus
[1:49:42] Christ with the family strengthen us
[1:49:44] Lord those days that are unspoken may
[1:49:47] you attend unto it Lord as reference
