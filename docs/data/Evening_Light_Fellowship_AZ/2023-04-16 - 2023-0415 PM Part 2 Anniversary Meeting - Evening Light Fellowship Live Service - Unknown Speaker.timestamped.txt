[0:03] is that right
[0:04] God being alone that's why when he saw
[0:07] Adam
[0:08] he said this is not good that man is
[0:12] alone
[0:14] but the man was not alone
[0:16] he had his wife in him
[0:21] so God was not so alone in that sense
[0:24] because all that God was within him
[0:29] but alone also means all
[0:33] in one
[0:36] and God said it is not good that all is
[0:40] in one
[0:44] Hallelujah God looked at Adam and he
[0:46] said I know how it is Adam
[0:49] so it is not do good that you are all in
[0:52] one
[0:56] Hallelujah
[0:58] amen so we understand this is God's
[1:00] desire again I want to read a few
[1:02] statements of the Prophet that just
[1:03] really to to see where we are coming
[1:06] from brother I'm saying what is God the
[1:08] great Eternal at the beginning way back
[1:10] before there was a beginning he wasn't
[1:12] even God did you know that God is an
[1:15] object of worship and there was nothing
[1:17] to worship him he lived alone
[1:20] and in him was attributes what does an
[1:23] attribute a thought
[1:25] now you get something that will buy that
[1:28] will bother on the lesson he said that
[1:30] he was his attributes that was in him
[1:34] God was his attributes that was in him
[1:38] and if you are an attribute of God
[1:41] you are God
[1:46] I don't speak of this human body
[1:48] absolutely not
[1:49] is that right
[1:51] but of who you really are
[1:54] because finally Rotherham said you've
[1:56] never seen me you just seen the outside
[1:57] man
[1:59] but the Inside Man is there you know
[2:01] what the inside man is made in the image
[2:03] of God
[2:06] is that correct
[2:08] just expressing himself on the outside
[2:10] now
[2:12] and one day Church it will be such a
[2:16] reality it will change our mortal bodies
[2:20] it's like a woman that has a child
[2:21] inside of her there comes a time she
[2:23] cannot hold it
[2:27] and Christ has grown
[2:29] that Revelation has grown in US and you
[2:32] see how how much it comes to it now I
[2:35] was really focusing to the end so Christ
[2:37] becomes so real inside of you
[2:41] it will change your mortal bodies
[2:46] Hallelujah this is the only thing that
[2:47] we're waiting for that Immortal ball is
[2:50] Roman ate it will be changed the final
[2:52] step of adoption is we get a new body
[2:56] is that right amen but it is inside of
[2:59] you
[3:00] the Rapture is inside of you the changes
[3:02] inside of you is not something from
[3:04] outside changes something from inside
[3:06] changing you
[3:13] well I'm saying like in the beginning
[3:14] God just permitted sin to come he didn't
[3:17] not he that wasn't his perfect will
[3:19] he permitted sin to come that wasn't his
[3:22] perfect will
[3:23] but he permitted it
[3:25] he said but you see God the great spirit
[3:27] the father in him with attributes and
[3:31] these things that you see this plate now
[3:32] is just his attributes being displayed
[3:35] because he dwelt alone
[3:38] amen so God dwelt Alone he was all in
[3:42] one this is that is how he looked to
[3:44] Adam he said that's not good that the
[3:46] man is alone
[3:49] because God said Adam I know how you
[3:51] feel
[3:52] because I was in the same stage
[3:56] I was all in one
[4:02] and when I was all in one I could not
[4:05] have Fellowship
[4:09] with my attributes
[4:14] Hallelujah
[4:15] amen
[4:19] now let's turn quickly to
[4:21] First Corinthians 15.
[4:27] First Corinthians 15 because
[4:30] we will see what really comes finally
[4:32] out at the end First Corinthians 15.
[4:38] can we say praise the Lord
[4:40] Hallelujah amen we serve a wonderful God
[4:44] Hallelujah
[4:46] I'm so excited because I know where I'm
[4:48] going
[4:49] I know where we come to and I know when
[4:52] you get there you will be excited I know
[4:55] that I'm sorry but I cannot because we
[4:56] want to see the way we want to really
[4:58] enjoy
[4:59] this road of Discovery we really want to
[5:02] enjoy it
[5:04] every step of it rejoice in the good
[5:07] days
[5:08] rejoice in the bad days
[5:10] sorry to say so enjoy the good days and
[5:14] enjoy the bad days
[5:19] say praise the Lord in the good days
[5:23] say praise the Lord in the bad days
[5:25] confuse the enemy
[5:30] confuse him
[5:33] the bride on Earth
[5:34] she is able to get the enemy to have a
[5:38] heart attack
[5:41] you can make the devil mad
[5:45] you can be the cause for him to take his
[5:47] heartfields
[5:50] because he just don't know what to do
[5:52] with you
[5:55] [Applause]
[5:56] he can throw everything on you he can he
[5:59] can he can collapse your home
[6:02] come on Church
[6:04] God can allow that
[6:07] he can allow that
[6:09] he is God
[6:13] is he God of your life
[6:15] so then he can do whatever he wants
[6:17] whatever he's trying to show he can do
[6:19] with it do we give them the allowance
[6:21] this evening
[6:23] Hallelujah he's not only Jehovah Jireh
[6:27] oh it was so so wonderful brother Ron
[6:29] handed me a little paper
[6:32] while I was coming here I was sitting in
[6:34] the plane it just came to me he's not
[6:36] just only Jehovah Jireh
[6:38] he's not only Jehovah
[6:45] don't limit him down to that expression
[6:49] he's Jehovah's
[6:52] he's Jehovah Shama
[6:55] our peace
[6:58] Hallelujah and when God decides I want
[7:02] to be Sharma to you
[7:06] what do you need
[7:09] storm
[7:13] come on Church
[7:15] you need storms so he can show
[7:18] that he's the Lord our peace
[7:22] you don't need peace in peace
[7:28] you need peace in the time of storm
[7:33] oh I trust we God we serve it we great
[7:35] God how great is our God
[7:38] Hallelujah and he decided
[7:41] he said Satan what you have done in my
[7:44] Eden
[7:47] I do in your Eden
[7:52] you came into my Eden by the way I
[7:54] allowed you
[7:57] you came into my Eden defied my bride in
[8:01] my Eden
[8:03] so now I come into your Eden
[8:08] and to bring a bride to perfection in
[8:11] your Eden
[8:13] [Music]
[8:15] this is his decision
[8:18] he didn't ask you
[8:21] if he could do it
[8:22] he just asked you do you want to be a
[8:24] part of it
[8:30] so don't be amazed when things go wrong
[8:36] oh my oh my my let's confuse the devil
[8:39] this evening
[8:41] when the devil bothers your mind said
[8:43] you look your family is upside down
[8:44] everything goes wrong say praise the
[8:46] Lord
[8:48] oh yeah just you tried to you tried to
[8:50] play he said no I'm not playing I know
[8:52] what God is doing
[8:54] because when I am weak he is strong
[8:58] when there's a storm coming he can prove
[9:01] that he's still Jehovah
[9:06] he's a present help in time
[9:12] so
[9:13] you need trouble
[9:20] I mean like I said let's let's get out
[9:21] of every box
[9:23] let's get out really that's what the
[9:25] prophet said come out of every camp
[9:27] the camp of your own understanding
[9:30] the camp of your own limitation brother
[9:33] Adam said my greatest enemy
[9:36] is not my wife
[9:39] is also not my church
[9:42] it's also not my brother and my sister
[9:45] said the greatest enemy that I have
[9:48] is William Branham
[9:52] he said when I get that guy out of the
[9:54] way
[9:55] then God can do things
[9:57] that William Branham is not even
[9:59] dreaming of
[10:01] do you believe that that God can do
[10:03] things tonight with you
[10:06] that you cannot even dream of
[10:08] oh let's confuse the enemy
[10:11] church we have a reason we have a reason
[10:13] to be joyful and happy in all
[10:16] circumstances
[10:19] because we know why we are here
[10:21] we know why we are here to express all
[10:24] that God is
[10:26] and he's not just only this why brother
[10:28] Ron was handing me that little paper I
[10:30] said you know it's sometimes how the
[10:31] Lord is really working in a wonderful I
[10:33] was sitting in the plane writing it down
[10:35] all Jehovah the the seven Redemptive
[10:37] names of Jehovah or or titles however
[10:39] the prophet called it that was
[10:41] manifested in Jesus Christ
[10:43] is that right
[10:45] and all that Christ was is nowhere
[10:53] so what do you expect now
[10:56] don't limit him just to this
[11:02] he want to show all that he is
[11:06] Hallelujah that's why brother Adam said
[11:08] he said law of contrast
[11:12] that if you had no rain
[11:14] you would not appreciate the Sun
[11:17] if you had no winter
[11:19] you wouldn't appreciate the summer
[11:21] if you had no evil
[11:24] you would not appreciate good
[11:30] we would not even know that he is a good
[11:32] god
[11:34] if there was not the devil
[11:38] all things he created
[11:40] he created for his own pleasure
[11:43] hallelujah what a mighty God we serve
[11:47] hallelujah what a mighty God we serve
[11:50] he's so great that he could create the
[11:53] devil
[11:56] knowing how he would turn
[12:00] and he was not nervous
[12:04] when iniquity was found in him
[12:09] Hallelujah
[12:13] it's the father behind it
[12:17] Hallelujah it is the father in the
[12:19] beginning it was on First Corinthians
[12:20] 15. we want to read once again says 15
[12:22] 24. to 28. listen what how Paul is
[12:26] really wonderful describing it
[12:30] then comes the end
[12:32] when he shall have delivered up the
[12:34] kingdom to God even the father when he
[12:38] shall have put down all Rule and all
[12:40] authority and Power
[12:42] for he must Reign till he hath put all
[12:45] enemies under his feet
[12:47] The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed
[12:50] is death
[12:52] for he has put all things under his feet
[12:55] but when he said all things are put
[12:57] under him it is manifested that he is
[13:00] expected which did put all things under
[13:03] him and when all things shall be subdued
[13:07] unto him then shall the son also himself
[13:11] be subject unto him
[13:14] and put all things under him
[13:18] that God
[13:20] maybe not
[13:22] alone anymore
[13:27] but now God can be all
[13:31] and in all
[13:36] this is his plan
[13:43] this is his plan
[13:45] God that was alone
[13:47] now he is God of all
[13:51] and in all
[14:00] that is the final worship
[14:03] that he will receive
[14:06] when he can be God
[14:08] of all
[14:09] and he can be God in all
[14:19] what a evolution
[14:24] now don't don't get the thought wrong
[14:26] now
[14:27] we're not speaking of evolution like we
[14:30] here in in usual
[14:32] but we are speaking of the evolution of
[14:35] the spirit
[14:40] Hallelujah
[14:42] the great God unveiling unfolding
[14:45] himself
[14:47] brother Adam said let me give you a few
[14:50] statements
[14:53] he said you understand he said in in The
[14:55] Invisible Union brother Adam said
[14:59] just like the evolution came
[15:04] just like the first thing God created
[15:06] probably botany life then he created
[15:08] animal life next and he created human
[15:10] life next kind of an evolution Rising
[15:14] higher
[15:17] so has it been God
[15:19] and his church
[15:25] justification under Luther
[15:26] sanctification pulling out his bride he
[15:29] is creating his pride justification
[15:31] andaluta sanctification under Vaseline
[15:33] and there was evolution of the spirit
[15:35] been giving more and more because the
[15:39] body is building coming to the head
[15:40] which is Christ the body of Christ
[15:45] yes sir amen
[15:48] countdown message
[15:50] 1962.
[15:56] this is exactly what the Bible said he
[15:58] did he made first the trees the botany
[16:01] life
[16:03] then he made
[16:04] then the last thing that ever come on
[16:06] the earth it was in form of creation was
[16:08] men
[16:10] nothing higher ever come
[16:13] because why it was a perfect reflection
[16:17] of the highest in heaven
[16:21] which God
[16:24] is men
[16:29] see God is men so therefore it proves
[16:32] and when God comes down and dwell among
[16:35] us he was a man
[16:38] and man it shows that the Perfection of
[16:41] evolution was God which is men
[16:50] let's go a little let's go a little
[16:52] further is it okay so far
[16:55] I don't speak of humanity
[16:59] and speak of men
[17:01] of mankind
[17:02] not of who men
[17:05] but of men
[17:08] human is like who man
[17:10] but we speak of men
[17:13] mankind
[17:17] look how what he did in the beginning
[17:19] let's we go to the Garden of Eden where
[17:22] he was really doing it what did he
[17:24] create first you know in Genesis 1 4 he
[17:28] made the light and it was
[17:30] when he had created the light
[17:33] and everything around he looked and God
[17:35] said it's good
[17:37] is that right he said it's good
[17:43] whatsoever good means for him
[17:48] he never said I think I did it good
[17:52] he saw the light
[17:56] it's good he said
[17:59] remember
[18:01] he had expression in his mind
[18:05] so the light
[18:06] is good for expression
[18:10] sir
[18:14] God wasn't attacking on the shoulder boy
[18:16] you did it good
[18:18] he saw the light
[18:19] and he said it is good
[18:26] Genesis 1 10 and he made the earth and
[18:28] the Seas and it was good they looked to
[18:33] the Earth
[18:35] he looked to the Seas
[18:37] and he said it's good
[18:43] he made the grass the herb healing seed
[18:45] the trees and it was good
[18:50] is that right
[18:52] amen so what what was God calling good
[18:57] he looked at it and he said that's good
[19:03] he made the sun and the moon and the
[19:05] stars
[19:07] and it was good
[19:10] all he created
[19:13] all the things that he created
[19:16] was
[19:18] for worship
[19:23] and God said that's good
[19:25] he looks at this building which is
[19:27] created for worship
[19:29] and it is good
[19:33] but when he sees you
[19:35] he gets excited
[19:40] amen when he sees the building he said
[19:42] that's nice that's good
[19:45] it's good you know it's good for worship
[19:48] but when he sees you
[19:50] yeah he does just not just say it's good
[19:53] he looks at you he said
[19:55] that's very good
[20:03] now let's turn Genesis 1 21 we just
[20:05] speak of worship Church
[20:07] and God wants to be worshiped
[20:10] God wants to express himself
[20:12] and he can do it through the sun is that
[20:15] right if you see the sonics expressing
[20:17] God and God said that son is good there
[20:19] it is just showing a part of who I am
[20:23] when he saw the light he said it is part
[20:26] of who I am
[20:27] through the light through the sun
[20:29] through the Earth through the trees you
[20:31] go in nature who do you see you see God
[20:34] is that right can you see God in nature
[20:37] nature is expressing God
[20:40] they're not trying to
[20:46] amen they're not trying to
[20:48] they're just manifesting expressing God
[20:51] when you see the great lying walking
[20:55] he he doesn't bother how can I express
[20:57] God what can I do to express God he's
[20:59] just doing what he has to do he's doing
[21:01] what he's created for
[21:08] Hallelujah
[21:12] he made the Earth he made the botanic
[21:14] life you make the animal life and the
[21:17] Bible said and it was good
[21:22] Genesis 1 25
[21:24] then he made man in his own image
[21:28] then he made man
[21:30] in his own image
[21:32] and when he saw him
[21:34] he said
[21:36] it's very good
[21:40] nothing can express me
[21:44] like men
[21:50] can we say praise the Lord
[21:52] Hallelujah we just want to see a little
[21:54] bit why God did what he did
[22:00] by the way
[22:02] you know what day
[22:04] he created men
[22:08] he created man on the sixth day
[22:13] sex by six is the number of men
[22:17] is that right
[22:20] and as we see six
[22:22] we always feel funny
[22:31] don't get too spiritual with this you
[22:33] know
[22:35] but he made him on the sixth day
[22:42] this book
[22:44] how many
[22:45] books is in this book
[22:48] 66.
[22:54] the prophet Isaiah wrote a miniature
[22:56] Bible
[22:58] how many chapters is in Isaiah
[23:00] 66.
[23:03] not 33
[23:08] that would maybe fit our box
[23:11] not 55.
[23:14] not 77.
[23:17] not even 88.
[23:20] sorry when I say that just to make it
[23:22] clear
[23:24] 66 books
[23:26] and you read I hope every day out of it
[23:31] 66.
[23:32] what is this book
[23:35] The Story of Man
[23:42] come on
[23:44] from his creation
[23:46] to his fall to his full restoration
[23:50] that's why in the beginning
[23:53] in Genesis 1.
[23:55] in the spirit of God moved upon the
[23:58] waters
[23:59] and God spoke it shall be light
[24:02] in the last book of this
[24:04] in Revelation
[24:06] the spirit is not alone
[24:09] because the Bible said and the spirit
[24:12] and the bride
[24:14] say come
[24:17] you see the story
[24:19] what God is in his mind he started alone
[24:22] in Genesis 1.
[24:24] but after 66 book he's not alone anymore
[24:28] now it is him and his bride speaking the
[24:31] same thing
[24:32] [Applause]
[24:35] what a mighty God we serve
[24:43] Hallelujah
[24:50] oh there's so many things I want to go
[24:52] so behind everything is the father
[24:57] like we would say would see even the
[24:59] Garden of Eden
[25:03] how he had eaten for worship and now he
[25:05] had
[25:06] Adam and Eve to worship
[25:09] and watch now how the father is doing it
[25:12] is God doing it now
[25:14] he put his son to sleep he put Adam to
[25:17] sleep
[25:19] it's always the father
[25:23] you know the story of
[25:26] Rebecca
[25:28] in the Bible that we are so proud of
[25:31] that we are part of Rebecca
[25:34] and then we had in elieza
[25:37] but you know who sent elieza out
[25:41] Abraham
[25:44] it was not Isaac looking for a wife
[25:47] it was Abraham
[25:49] looking for a wife
[25:51] for Isaac
[25:55] it was the father
[26:01] what was in the mind of the father why
[26:04] he was so concerned
[26:07] to get a good wife for his son
[26:12] why was God in the beginning putting
[26:14] Adam to sleep
[26:16] and he said I will take care for a wife
[26:18] for you
[26:22] amen
[26:26] because it is always the father
[26:30] that is trying to unveil and reveal
[26:33] himself
[26:36] Hallelujah it is the father trying to
[26:39] show more of himself
[26:41] so he told elieza Abraham told elieza
[26:43] you go to a certain place don't go
[26:45] anywhere
[26:47] don't get me a bride
[26:50] that is not able to manifest more of me
[27:01] amen
[27:04] because when
[27:08] is God
[27:11] Abraham and Isaac
[27:16] and Abraham did not want to have another
[27:18] Isaac
[27:23] he wanted to show more of him
[27:29] can we say praise the Lord
[27:34] I trust forget the picture of what God
[27:36] is doing
[27:37] he was he was looking for a bride
[27:40] for his son
[27:42] that's why at Calvary
[27:44] he put the son to sleep
[27:49] foreign
[27:50] amen
[27:52] showing again
[27:53] that this is not the work of the Sun
[27:56] this is the work of the father
[28:01] you know why he did that
[28:03] because he wanted to he needed you
[28:06] that's why he made you
[28:08] he is not only our creator he is Our
[28:12] Redeemer and he is also our husband he's
[28:16] all in all and he is creating you for
[28:19] his pleasure
[28:21] amen he took you out of Jesus Christ
[28:25] like he took Eve out of Adam like he was
[28:28] looking for a wife for his son Isaac the
[28:31] Father Abraham was looking we read the
[28:34] wonderful example in Matthew 22 and
[28:36] father making a marriage for his son
[28:44] father
[28:46] is inviting
[28:48] is that right it's not the son inviting
[28:52] it's a father inviting
[28:55] you know who the son is
[28:58] find in this chapter the bride
[29:06] Hallelujah it is the father
[29:08] that is looking
[29:11] inviting
[29:13] to come to the wedding
[29:16] the father gets upset
[29:21] and somebody don't want to come
[29:27] amen
[29:29] so it was the father inviting
[29:31] for the wedding of his son
[29:34] because the Father Knows only the right
[29:37] kind of wife
[29:40] is expressing through the sun more of me
[29:47] this is what God is doing
[29:51] Hallelujah
[29:53] this is why he put Christ at Calvary to
[29:57] sleep
[29:58] to take a bride out of his sight
[30:01] he made him
[30:03] a wife
[30:05] is that right
[30:07] like Adam
[30:09] was put to sleep and God formed the
[30:12] woman out of him
[30:16] and then you understand the whole
[30:18] situation actually started and then God
[30:20] allowed the fall
[30:25] God working in thick Darkness
[30:29] you're still with me
[30:32] this is what Solomon saw
[30:35] said oh God is generating worship
[30:40] in a great mistake Mystic mystical form
[30:45] he's just generating worship after
[30:47] worship after worship
[30:50] now you see how it how was in the garden
[30:53] of to really make that a little bit more
[30:56] plain
[30:57] before we really go on and and and and
[31:00] get a step further
[31:03] we just really want to see how it was in
[31:05] Genesis and what God really created or
[31:09] made man for and put him
[31:12] made him from the dust of the Earth
[31:15] and gave him a wife
[31:17] and then you know in the beginning he
[31:19] said multiplay and replenish the Earth
[31:23] and listen what's how brother Venom
[31:25] nicely how he really nicely put it
[31:29] and I trust I'm not going too far here
[31:31] and there
[31:33] but just to show
[31:35] what we are dedicated for is to worship
[31:38] Him
[31:40] is to express more of himself
[31:44] while the whole world is worshiping
[31:47] Satan
[31:49] we are worshiping
[31:51] the only one in living God
[31:54] why the whole world is manifesting
[31:59] expressing all the dirt that is in Satan
[32:03] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[32:06] expressing God in his entirety
[32:16] just like in the beginning does God
[32:18] change his mind about his word just like
[32:20] in the beginning it was not God's
[32:22] perfect will for children to be born on
[32:25] Earth through sex
[32:27] no sir God created Man Out of the Dust
[32:31] of the Earth
[32:32] breathe as the breath of life into him
[32:34] and he became a living Soul he did he
[32:37] took from that man a helpmate and made a
[32:40] wife to him that was God's first and
[32:44] original will
[32:49] can we say praise the Lord
[32:53] Hallelujah therefore all things that had
[32:56] a beginning has to have an end and all
[32:59] sin has to come to an inhalation and all
[33:01] sin has to be done away therefore in the
[33:04] great Millennium when the Resurrection
[33:06] comes we will not have to be reborn
[33:08] Again by our fathers or mothers but God
[33:11] like he did in the beginning will call
[33:14] men from the dust of the earth and his
[33:17] help made with him
[33:23] amen
[33:24] hallelujah what a great plan Church
[33:33] so it's behind all church is the father
[33:36] trying to reveal himself
[33:39] spoken word the original seat
[33:44] you ready
[33:47] fasten your seat belts please
[33:51] can get turbulent
[33:57] now if God said multiply to his pride to
[34:00] Adam's wife and replenish the Earth that
[34:02] was God's Commission
[34:04] when God gave a commission which cannot
[34:06] perish God's word is eternal cannot fail
[34:09] he said multiply and replenish the Earth
[34:11] that was God's Eternal purpose to carry
[34:14] that house you cannot die because it is
[34:16] his word you have to live if that
[34:19] child's
[34:20] been brought forth right there had been
[34:23] no death but she could not wait
[34:26] if that first child Abel would have come
[34:30] forth right
[34:33] there would be no death
[34:38] but it came wrong
[34:41] it came via sex
[34:43] that's why death came
[34:46] but it if that first child would come
[34:48] right
[34:49] there would be no death
[34:59] and if the first child would have come
[35:01] right the next child would have come
[35:03] right
[35:06] what would it be a further expression of
[35:09] God
[35:13] amen
[35:14] Abel
[35:16] was not just a copy of
[35:18] Adam
[35:20] but Abel was a further expression of God
[35:26] do you believe Abel was the son of God
[35:31] he was a further expression of God
[35:36] why Cain was the further expression
[35:42] of his father
[35:45] amen
[35:52] now
[35:54] speaking of Jesus Christ
[35:56] listen what brother random said
[36:00] Jesus Christ
[36:03] he was deceit
[36:06] that if
[36:08] should have produced
[36:11] do you get it
[36:14] he was deceit
[36:21] this would be the final outcome
[36:25] amen multiply and replenish
[36:28] finally
[36:29] she would have brought forth Jesus
[36:31] Christ
[36:36] all
[36:37] that Adam and Eve
[36:40] lost
[36:42] Christ died for
[36:47] and we are back to a church
[36:52] that's why all that God was
[36:55] now in the church
[36:59] waiting for manifestation
[37:02] are you ready for it
[37:04] Hallelujah this is God's great plan this
[37:07] is this is his great plan of worship to
[37:09] be worshiped
[37:11] so that he could express him in his
[37:13] entire form
[37:17] Eve should have done it
[37:19] but God allowed to fall
[37:22] so that he could show more of himself
[37:26] but if Eve would not have fallen if Eve
[37:30] would have bring forth the first child
[37:31] the right way not by sex
[37:35] but by the spoken word
[37:38] finally Jesus Christ will have come
[37:39] forth
[37:40] and if we are back to it you know what
[37:43] is coming forth through the Bride of
[37:44] Jesus Christ
[37:47] Jesus Christ
[37:52] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[38:00] can we say praise the Lord
[38:03] What a Mighty plan God has
[38:05] what a plan is in his mind
[38:07] I'm sorry it's maybe a little bit struck
[38:10] up but I trust you see what God's plan
[38:12] really was
[38:14] and I understand how Satan is trying to
[38:16] interrupt that
[38:18] because he don't want the church to get
[38:20] to the true revelation
[38:22] because if the church wants gets a true
[38:24] revelation
[38:25] of the two Spirits working the spirit of
[38:28] God and the Antichrist spirit
[38:31] she's in she's an infancy she's an
[38:33] invincible Army nope nothing can
[38:36] defeated she will bring forth Jesus
[38:38] Christ
[38:42] because all that God was
[38:46] now in the church
[38:51] can we say praise the Lord
[38:54] Hallelujah
[38:55] amen I'm really wondering if I would
[38:57] should continue
[39:09] as time went on
[39:13] you know after the fall finally
[39:16] we can see
[39:19] another step
[39:21] that God is taking
[39:24] in his plan and in his purpose in his
[39:27] Redemption
[39:30] we we find out then in Exodus 25 verse
[39:34] 8.
[39:36] that God again is looking at it
[39:39] and God is trying to show
[39:41] things now and he is telling Moses
[39:44] finally in Exodus 28 you
[39:46] just please make me a tabernacle
[39:50] I won't have a tabernacle
[39:54] because it says in Genesis in Exodus 25
[39:57] 8 make me a tabernacle make them a
[40:00] tabernacle so that I may dwell amongst
[40:04] them
[40:07] Hallelujah that I can live amongst them
[40:10] so that dwell means in Hebrews to settle
[40:12] to abide to establish to lay an intimate
[40:16] relationship God Desiring a place for
[40:20] worship
[40:23] with the people
[40:25] and then we can read sorry when I when I
[40:27] go a little bit the step just showing
[40:29] you just showing us how God always
[40:32] desired to have a place to worship
[40:36] and we his skin is coming from the
[40:38] Garden of Eden how he is going down then
[40:40] to Exodus 25 with the Tabernacle and he
[40:43] has and finally he comes he comes David
[40:46] Here Comes David and he said to the Lord
[40:48] and you know by the way
[40:53] as the Tabernacle
[40:55] was finally what what Moses Moses was
[40:59] caught up into heaven is that right
[41:03] to see what the Tabernacle should be
[41:06] and when he came down to earth he just
[41:09] the first thing he expressed was the
[41:11] tabernacle and because of the
[41:14] circumstances it was a moving Tabernacle
[41:20] amen
[41:22] amen the first materialization of what
[41:26] what he saw in heaven
[41:29] was a moving Tabernacle
[41:36] what do we see today
[41:42] what do we see today
[41:45] not a static Tabernacle
[41:48] we see a moving Tabernacle
[41:53] Hallelujah
[41:55] a moving Mercy Seat
[41:59] not a static Mercy Seat
[42:02] a moving Mercy Seat
[42:04] what do we see today
[42:07] a moving Mercy Seat
[42:10] where's the mercy today
[42:13] in the hearts of his people
[42:21] then we see then finally David
[42:24] had to desire said it is not good that I
[42:26] dwell in the temple I dwell in a nice
[42:28] palace and you just live in tents
[42:32] second Samuel we can read it and then
[42:34] God said no no it's it's fine he said to
[42:36] David it's fine he said uh you know you
[42:39] cannot do that your son son Solomon will
[42:42] do that he will make me a tabernacle
[42:45] amen he will make me a tabernacle
[42:50] and he builded that wonderful Tabernacle
[42:52] that we have read in second chronicles
[42:54] he builded the Tabernacle where the
[42:56] presence of the Lord came down filled
[42:58] the place
[42:59] but after a Time the Tabernacle was
[43:01] destroyed
[43:04] what has got in his mind
[43:06] what has got in his mind all the time
[43:08] expression
[43:10] expression
[43:11] expression
[43:13] just want to express more of him just
[43:15] wanted to express more of him
[43:19] like he wants to do this evening
[43:24] he is allowing circumstances
[43:26] the first temple was destroyed
[43:29] amen
[43:30] and then they came to the rebuilding of
[43:32] the Temple it went on you understand it
[43:35] went on
[43:36] Temple was destroyed Babylon then the
[43:39] group came out of Babylon and then they
[43:42] rebuilded the temple
[43:45] why we go why we would go to the
[43:47] scripture we find out the rebuilded
[43:49] temple
[43:53] that the people saw
[43:57] and the people were so frustrated about
[44:00] what they saw in the rebuilding
[44:06] and God said through his prophet
[44:10] higai
[44:12] he said
[44:13] the second temple
[44:16] it's Beauty
[44:18] it's greater
[44:19] than the beauty of the first temple
[44:26] that great church of Pentecost
[44:30] can we say praise the Lord
[44:33] Hallelujah can we say Amen
[44:36] Hallelujah God is speaking about you
[44:40] that great church of Pentecost a type of
[44:43] that Temple that Solomon built
[44:46] that great church of Pentecost full of
[44:48] the Holy Ghost fell through the Dark
[44:50] Ages
[44:52] now it's coming back in its beauty
[44:55] out of Babylon the group comes
[44:57] rebuilding the temple
[45:00] amen and the temple in his outshine that
[45:03] you know that many things of the temple
[45:05] was destroyed
[45:07] it did not look like the first one and
[45:09] the people get so frustrated about and
[45:11] this is how the people are frustrated
[45:13] today when the Sea of the church has
[45:15] said hey it is not like it's supposed to
[45:18] be
[45:19] and God sends a prophet God said the
[45:22] prophet hege and he told the people God
[45:24] God told him tell my people
[45:27] this the beauty of the second temple is
[45:30] greater than the beauty of the first
[45:33] because through the second temple I can
[45:34] express more of myself
[45:42] the church that is here that is there
[45:45] today
[45:47] the beauty of it is greater
[45:49] then of the first church of Pentecost
[45:55] because this church
[45:56] is expressing more of God
[46:01] can we believe that
[46:08] wonderful God we serve
[46:12] you are wonderful people
[46:15] just to absorb that word
[46:18] it is not my word is this is what the
[46:19] prophet said
[46:25] Hallelujah
[46:28] amen and as as we walk our way as we
[46:30] walk our path
[46:32] I just feel the Holy Spirit moving in
[46:34] such a deep into such a mighty way
[46:43] Hallelujah
[46:45] and as we understood
[46:48] this bride this Eve
[46:50] will not fall like the first one
[46:53] finally all expression are done
[46:58] now this bride this church will not fall
[47:02] again
[47:05] but this church will be the final
[47:07] expression
[47:10] of Jesus Christ of the almighty God
[47:14] in his entire fullness
[47:18] God bless you

[1:05:28] promise that his word would make itself
[1:05:31] manifest through us
[1:05:34] that's the promise
[1:05:36] you know and sometimes it doesn't look
[1:05:39] like the promise is coming to pass but
[1:05:41] others see it sometimes more than you do
[1:05:44] but that's also a trick of the enemy you
[1:05:47] know I don't mean to take more time but
[1:05:49] we went to a Jewish Seder this last week
[1:05:53] and the rabbi that was doing the Seder
[1:05:57] he uh he was saying in Israel and in Old
[1:06:00] Israel Whenever there was a marriage to
[1:06:03] take place
[1:06:04] he said the father would send the son
[1:06:06] away
[1:06:08] to go prepare a place
[1:06:11] and he says no matter how bad that son
[1:06:13] wanted to get married
[1:06:15] it wasn't up to the Sun to say I'm ready
[1:06:19] he said it took the father
[1:06:21] to say okay now you're ready
[1:06:28] you know you see the types
[1:06:30] it's like no wonder God chose Israel to
[1:06:33] express himself
[1:06:35] but thank you Lord that you chose us to
[1:06:38] express you in this last thing
[1:06:41] foreheads dear heavenly father
