[36:29] was telling brother Ron that you know
[36:31] brother Ram said when job got so
[36:33] distressed Jesus took over
[36:36] you know and it's like that Rose we got
[36:39] to realize we're getting our trials
[36:41] these hard trials we go through
[36:43] sometimes sometimes we got to realize
[36:45] that we need to get so distressed so
[36:47] Jesus can take over
[36:49] you know when you take that Rosebud if
[36:52] you try to unfold a rosebud by yourself
[36:55] you make a mess of it
[36:57] but when that Rosebud
[36:59] gets in the right soil gets in the right
[37:02] weather the heat then it starts
[37:05] unfolding and it becomes a beautiful
[37:07] rose

[45:44] amen
[45:49] they had a youth meeting over there at
[45:52] the Wallace Ranch
[45:54] uh yesterday and
[45:57] I want to say thank you to brother
[45:59] Russell and sister Elizabeth
[46:01] for them opening their home and their
[46:05] Ranch there and the kids and they all
[46:07] had a good time and so I appreciate it
[46:09] now you all notice we have a new pulpit
[46:14] and uh
[46:16] I'm a little bit sentimental because the
[46:18] other one was from the very beginning
[46:21] and everything but we know that even
[46:22] brother Branham uh when he had his first
[46:25] pulpit and remember the old Pulpit that
[46:28] was there that during the time the flood
[46:30] and it it rose up still had to Bible on
[46:32] top come back down in the same spot and
[46:35] everything and yet when um uh later they
[46:38] remodeled
[46:40] the Tabernacle uh brother Banks Woods
[46:42] went ahead and made him uh a new pulpit
[46:45] and so
[46:48] um
[46:49] yeah this one's uh big
[46:53] I'll have to do a little bit more
[46:54] walking they probably go around it it is
[46:57] the right height the brothers I think
[47:00] Ethan Strayer said brother Ron I hope
[47:01] it's the right night I said if it's not
[47:04] I'm gonna have to get after the guy that
[47:06] told him how tall it would be and that
[47:08] was me so no it it fits it it works it's
[47:12] it's good and I appreciate it and um uh
[47:17] listen uh I wanted to go ahead before we
[47:20] actually go on with the the service here
[47:23] because the pulpit
[47:27] is to be
[47:28] a very special place
[47:31] now you all remember that this Bible was
[47:33] under the pulpit
[47:35] of the original Pulpit back on Maryland
[47:40] and to just let you know
[47:44] that the Bible was open when we went
[47:46] into the church just to look at it
[47:52] and it was open to
[47:54] Matthew and it says
[47:57] he that receiveth the prophet in the
[48:00] name of a prophet shall receive a
[48:01] prophet's reward
[48:05] and as I read that the Holy Spirit came
[48:08] down as all of you
[48:10] well most all of you will know some of
[48:13] her visitors don't the Holy Spirit came
[48:15] down and anointed me
[48:16] in the Pulpit with this Bible with this
[48:19] word
[48:20] and I said God has given us this church
[48:24] and we know the testimony of what God
[48:28] has done and God has not only provided
[48:31] that church but he's provided even a
[48:34] place when we were on 51st Avenue the
[48:36] school because we needed a bigger place
[48:39] and now he's provided this and
[48:43] uh I am so
[48:46] thankful to God and I would like some of
[48:48] the ministers and I would like some of
[48:51] the deacon Brethren James love all
[48:54] different ones would you Brethren come

[50:04] anoint
[50:06] this pulpit and may whoever stands
[50:09] behind it feel that anointing as they
[50:12] come behind the veil I pray o God that
[50:16] the word will go forth from behind this
[50:19] public without fear or favor I pray o
[50:23] God that it will circumcise the heart of
[50:26] every individual that comes in here Lord
[50:29] and I pray May there be such an
[50:32] illumination and a revelation that would
[50:35] emanate forth from this Pulpit because

[59:52] who hath believed our report
[59:56] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[59:58] revealed
[1:00:01] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:00:04] tender plant
[1:00:05] and as it root out of a dry ground
[1:00:09] he hath no form nor comeliness
[1:00:13] and when we shall see him
[1:00:15] there is no Beauty
[1:00:17] that we should desire him
[1:00:21] he is despised
[1:00:23] and rejected of men
[1:00:27] a Man of Sorrows
[1:00:30] acquainted with grief
[1:00:33] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[1:00:37] he was despised
[1:00:40] and we esteemed him not
[1:00:44] surely he hath borne our griefs
[1:00:47] carried
[1:00:49] our sorrows
[1:00:51] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[1:00:56] of God and afflicted
[1:01:00] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:01:04] he was bruised for our iniquities
[1:01:09] and the chastisement of our peace was
[1:01:12] upon him
[1:01:14] and with his stripes
[1:01:17] we are healed
[1:01:19] [Music]
[1:01:21] all we like sheep have gone astray
[1:01:25] we have turned everyone to his own way
[1:01:28] the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity
[1:01:33] of us all
[1:01:35] he was suppressed and he was afflicted
[1:01:39] yet he opened not his mouth
[1:01:42] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[1:01:45] and as a sheep before her shears is done
[1:01:49] dumb
[1:01:51] so he opened not his mouth
[1:01:55] he was taken from prison and from
[1:01:58] judgment
[1:02:00] and who shall declare his generation
[1:02:04] for he was cut off out of the land of
[1:02:07] the living
[1:02:09] and for the transgression of my people
[1:02:13] was he stricken
[1:02:17] and he made his grave with the wicked in
[1:02:20] the with the rich in his death because
[1:02:22] he had done no violence neither was any
[1:02:26] deceit in his mouth
[1:02:28] yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him
[1:02:33] he hath put him to grief
[1:02:36] when thou shalt make his soul an
[1:02:39] offering for sin
[1:02:41] he shall see his seed
[1:02:44] he shall prolong his days and the
[1:02:47] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[1:02:50] his hand
[1:02:51] and he shall
[1:02:53] see of the travail of his soul and shall
[1:02:56] be satisfied
[1:02:58] and by his knowledge shall my righteous
[1:03:01] servant justify many
[1:03:04] for he shall bear their iniquities
[1:03:08] therefore will I divide him a portion
[1:03:10] with the Great
[1:03:13] and he shall divide the spoil with the
[1:03:16] strong
[1:03:17] because he hath poured out his soul unto
[1:03:21] death
[1:03:22] and he was numbered with the
[1:03:24] transgressors
[1:03:25] and he bear the sin of many
[1:03:28] and made intercession
[1:03:31] for the transgressors
[1:03:34] can you all say Amen to that
[1:03:45] he was stricken
[1:03:49] smitten of God and afflicted
[1:03:54] turn with me one more portion of
[1:03:56] scripture Ephesians chapter 2.
[1:04:03] Ephesians 2 10-14
[1:04:07] Ephesians chapter 2.
[1:04:10] verse 10 for we are his workmanship
[1:04:15] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:04:20] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:04:23] should walk in them
[1:04:26] remember wherefore remember that ye
[1:04:30] being in time past Gentiles In the Flesh
[1:04:32] who are called on circumcision by that
[1:04:36] which is called the circumcision in the
[1:04:38] flesh made by hands
[1:04:41] that at that time ye were without Christ
[1:04:46] being aliens from the Commonwealth of
[1:04:49] Israel and strangers from the covenants
[1:04:52] of the promise
[1:04:53] having no hope
[1:04:56] and without God in the world
[1:04:58] but now in Christ Jesus ye are sometime
[1:05:03] ye who were sometimes were afar off are
[1:05:07] made nigh by the blood of Christ
[1:05:10] Hallelujah
[1:05:13] he is our peace
[1:05:15] who hath both made one and hath broken
[1:05:19] down the middle wall of partition
[1:05:23] between us may God bless the reading of
[1:05:26] his word you may be seated this morning
[1:05:28] in the presence of God
[1:05:31] amen I want to title my sermon this
[1:05:34] morning
[1:05:36] the flawed masterpiece
[1:05:41] and I want to take a subject of the flaw
[1:05:45] was what made it the masterpiece
[1:05:51] I've been studying and reading the other
[1:05:53] day
[1:05:55] and I was reading about perfection
[1:06:00] and how that we are made perfect by
[1:06:02] being in Christ
[1:06:06] and during my studies as I was reading
[1:06:09] from the sermon the masterpiece
[1:06:12] he came across a sentence
[1:06:14] that just absolutely struck me
[1:06:18] and I'm sure all of you have had times
[1:06:21] wherein you're reading your Bible you're
[1:06:24] reading the message of the hour you're
[1:06:26] just going along and all of a sudden you
[1:06:28] read something that gets your attention
[1:06:32] that absolutely quickens you
[1:06:36] and sometimes the prophet of God said
[1:06:39] when you take a sermon he said actually
[1:06:42] what God does is he gives a thought
[1:06:46] and around that thought he begins to add
[1:06:49] more thoughts but the whole sermon is
[1:06:52] around one Central thought
[1:06:57] and so I wish to share with you
[1:07:00] this sentence that just absolutely stood
[1:07:04] out to me and I want to build my sermon
[1:07:07] around that
[1:07:10] and that's the reason that I have said I
[1:07:12] call this the flawed
[1:07:14] masterpiece
[1:07:17] in the sermon the Masterpiece in 1964
[1:07:21] brother Brahm says after he spent all
[1:07:24] that time he's speaking about
[1:07:26] Michelangelo right now and he's typing
[1:07:29] it even unto God
[1:07:31] for years and years to make this
[1:07:34] then under the influence of seeing
[1:07:37] fulfilled what he had seen in his heart
[1:07:40] and in his vision and desired to see it
[1:07:44] was completed
[1:07:47] and when it was completed he was so
[1:07:49] inspired by it till he thought his own
[1:07:54] Masterpiece should speak back to him
[1:08:00] Hallelujah
[1:08:10] and he struck it across the leg and
[1:08:12] hollered
[1:08:13] speak
[1:08:15] they made a flaw on it
[1:08:19] they put a flaw on the image
[1:08:22] to me
[1:08:25] the flaw
[1:08:27] was what made it
[1:08:29] the masterpiece
[1:08:35] now maybe in the mind you might think
[1:08:38] different
[1:08:40] you think that spoiled it no to me
[1:08:43] it made it what it was
[1:08:48] so many years of careful work and toils
[1:08:52] and inspiration
[1:08:54] and so forth making it his toil had
[1:08:56] proved
[1:08:57] not in vain
[1:09:00] it was perfect that's why he cried out
[1:09:02] speak
[1:09:03] because he had seen before him that was
[1:09:07] had been able to achieve to bring to
[1:09:11] pass the vision that was in his mind
[1:09:14] and therefore under inspiration he done
[1:09:17] something out of out of the reason out
[1:09:20] of the ordinary he struck it he hollered
[1:09:23] speak see he wouldn't have done that if
[1:09:27] he had a thought but he didn't think it
[1:09:30] was inspiration of seeing what he had in
[1:09:34] his mind
[1:09:35] sitting there perfectly before him you
[1:09:39] see he became so inspired
[1:09:42] that this Vision that was in his mind
[1:09:45] now the prophet of God takes you back
[1:09:47] and he says there I can see Michelangelo
[1:09:50] he said that great sculptor and they was
[1:09:53] brought to him a slab of marble
[1:09:57] it had no shape and form except for just
[1:10:01] a big block of marble
[1:10:03] and he said for days
[1:10:06] he would walk around
[1:10:09] and he looked at it and he meditated and
[1:10:12] he thought about it and he walked around
[1:10:15] it and he was waiting for inspiration
[1:10:19] and when the inspiration
[1:10:22] began to strike him he grabbed his
[1:10:25] hammer and mallet and he began to work
[1:10:28] and chisel away and the prophet of God
[1:10:31] said that what he was doing was he was
[1:10:34] chiseling away everything that was not a
[1:10:38] part of the vision
[1:10:40] whoa glory to God that's what he does
[1:10:44] with every one of you
[1:10:46] oh when he starts working on you in
[1:10:48] large chunks begin to fall off and all
[1:10:52] of that how many of you remember when
[1:10:53] God got a hold of you and you don't need
[1:10:55] this and you don't need that and you
[1:10:57] don't and all of this and God starts
[1:10:59] setting you free
[1:11:01] but now as he comes down to the finished
[1:11:04] work
[1:11:06] it's now delicate it's very intricate
[1:11:09] it's not with a big hammer and a chisel
[1:11:14] now it might be just a small file
[1:11:18] or a small scrape of something a tool in
[1:11:23] his hand
[1:11:25] and
[1:11:27] the vision now became so perfectly
[1:11:30] before him
[1:11:31] until after years and years
[1:11:35] of his work was there perfectly as it
[1:11:39] was in his mind his vision now was
[1:11:43] before him
[1:11:45] and he wasn't thinking about it he got
[1:11:47] so inspired he stepped into his vision
[1:11:51] and he spotted
[1:11:55] and it was the smiting
[1:11:58] of the image
[1:12:00] that made it the masterpiece
[1:12:06] now I want to take this
[1:12:11] and I want to tell you that the flaw
[1:12:16] that is in the masterpiece
[1:12:19] is the bride
[1:12:24] for she is the reason
[1:12:28] why he became flawed
[1:12:36] all of us are flawed individuals
[1:12:41] maybe you haven't figured that out yet
[1:12:45] maybe you're walking around thinking
[1:12:48] you're perfect but just give you some
[1:12:50] time
[1:12:51] you'll find out that you're imperfect
[1:12:57] we have all kinds of flaws in our sinful
[1:13:00] flesh
[1:13:02] for the Bible says we were born in sin
[1:13:05] shaped in iniquity we came into the
[1:13:07] world speaking lies
[1:13:11] we were flawed from the beginning
[1:13:15] ever since the fall in the garden
[1:13:18] we have seen that mankind has become a
[1:13:21] flawed race
[1:13:24] there's only one that was born without
[1:13:27] flaw
[1:13:28] without blemish
[1:13:30] there was no sin that became that could
[1:13:33] be laid to his charge
[1:13:38] so we can say that the Great Masterpiece
[1:13:40] of God
[1:13:42] became Jesus Christ
[1:13:46] he was The Great Masterpiece that was
[1:13:48] going to be smitten
[1:13:50] and afflicted
[1:13:52] brother Branham continues in the service
[1:13:54] the Masterpiece now let us turn the page
[1:13:57] of Michelangelo
[1:13:59] and close the book
[1:14:02] and let's open another book
[1:14:05] and read of the great Sculptor
[1:14:08] the Almighty
[1:14:10] who before there was a world before the
[1:14:14] foundation was laid
[1:14:16] he had in his mind what he wanted and he
[1:14:21] wanted to make man in his own image he
[1:14:24] wanted to make something in a reality of
[1:14:27] what a vision was to him
[1:14:31] what was in
[1:14:33] his thinking
[1:14:37] so God began to create in the womb of
[1:14:40] his mind
[1:14:42] because we all know that the womb is a
[1:14:45] place of conception
[1:14:47] it is a place wherein things are formed
[1:14:52] for the mind is the womb to the spirit
[1:14:55] brother Branham in the spoken word he's
[1:14:57] the Original Seed
[1:14:59] he said now there's a womb of the
[1:15:01] physical and there's a womb of the
[1:15:04] spirit
[1:15:05] do you believe that there is a spiritual
[1:15:07] room and a physical womb and the mind is
[1:15:11] the womb
[1:15:12] to the spirit
[1:15:14] so but God began to create in the womb
[1:15:17] of his mind to bring forth a masterpiece
[1:15:23] something that he had
[1:15:26] in his thoughts and in his mind before
[1:15:29] there was Stardust
[1:15:34] for we know that Jesus the Bible says is
[1:15:37] the beginning of the creation of God
[1:15:41] he was the firstborn of God
[1:15:43] among many brethren
[1:15:49] he was created first in the mind of God
[1:15:58] he was first born
[1:16:01] in the mind of God
[1:16:03] he was first crucified
[1:16:07] in the mind of God
[1:16:12] let's go on now brother Branham says in
[1:16:15] masterpiece
[1:16:17] and now to Michelangelo that was an
[1:16:20] attribute of his thought
[1:16:22] and God wanted to make a man after his
[1:16:25] image the great Sculptor
[1:16:28] and he went to work on him and we notice
[1:16:31] as he brought up from the materials
[1:16:34] perhaps from fishes and birds and
[1:16:36] creeping things on the Earth
[1:16:38] and many things that he brought but
[1:16:40] finally as he brewed of being creator
[1:16:44] he wasn't like a man now a sculptor that
[1:16:48] was taking something that's been created
[1:16:50] to a new image he was a sculptor of
[1:16:54] Eternal things
[1:16:56] he was the sculptor that could create
[1:16:59] and bring into existence
[1:17:01] that which he has in his mind to do
[1:17:05] or otherwise he can make material what
[1:17:08] his attributes desired
[1:17:12] in the womb of God's mind he wanted to
[1:17:15] be a savior
[1:17:17] a redeemer
[1:17:19] A Healer
[1:17:21] a provider
[1:17:23] a shepherd
[1:17:25] he had all of these attributes that God
[1:17:28] wanted to do but he couldn't do it until
[1:17:32] he expressed it
[1:17:34] and when he began to speak and God
[1:17:37] created by the spoken word from the
[1:17:40] thoughts of his mind the thoughts spoken
[1:17:43] became a creative word
[1:17:49] so we find that the first man that God
[1:17:52] created was Adam
[1:17:56] foreign
[1:18:01] of God of this hour began to tell us
[1:18:04] what kind of a man was Adam he was a God
[1:18:08] man
[1:18:09] he was a spirit man he did not have a
[1:18:12] body he brewed it over the Earth
[1:18:15] like the Holy Spirit Broods over the
[1:18:17] church making itself known Adam was
[1:18:21] making himself known he was
[1:18:23] orchestrating over the garden he had
[1:18:26] authority over it he was a God over it
[1:18:29] but there was no man to till the soil
[1:18:32] Genesis 1 man was a spirit man but
[1:18:36] Genesis 2 God saw that there was no man
[1:18:39] to till the soil so now he takes Out of
[1:18:42] the Dust of the earth oh God this great
[1:18:47] Creator now
[1:18:51] the calcium and there he takes and he
[1:18:55] begins to form something he said there
[1:18:57] he says Adam stood like a tree
[1:19:02] he said there his branches out his toes
[1:19:06] like the roots of the tree into the
[1:19:09] ground
[1:19:10] and he stood there lifeless there was
[1:19:13] nothing and God breathed into the
[1:19:16] nostrils
[1:19:18] the Breath of Life
[1:19:20] the spirit of God now hitters
[1:19:25] and now Adam becomes a living soul
[1:19:31] the first time that you see a soul a
[1:19:34] part of God's attribute a part of God
[1:19:37] himself has now become a living soul
[1:19:46] in the sermon the Masterpiece let's go
[1:19:49] on
[1:19:50] and then I might say to this and that
[1:19:52] when he made this man there was
[1:19:54] something about him that didn't look
[1:19:56] just right
[1:19:58] because
[1:20:00] he was by himself
[1:20:04] and that's how God had been
[1:20:07] by himself he was the eternal
[1:20:12] the man now in the image of God also
[1:20:15] existed on Earth by himself
[1:20:18] so he must have struck a little blow
[1:20:22] over on his left side
[1:20:24] and from there he took the peace
[1:20:27] that struck off of it and made a
[1:20:30] helpmate
[1:20:31] a wife
[1:20:34] notice he struck the image of Adam
[1:20:38] then he wasn't by himself
[1:20:41] he had somebody with him
[1:20:45] that's
[1:20:47] his great work
[1:20:51] God smote at him and put him to sleep
[1:20:55] struck a piece off of Adam
[1:20:58] to make him a help me to wife
[1:21:01] so the smitten flaw of Adam became his
[1:21:04] help mate
[1:21:06] she was a byproduct of Adam the prophet
[1:21:10] of God said she was not in the original
[1:21:11] creation
[1:21:17] Adam was made in the image of God but
[1:21:20] Eve was made in the image
[1:21:23] of Adam
[1:21:25] she was not created
[1:21:29] by taking some dust out of the Earth
[1:21:32] and blowing the breath of life into her
[1:21:36] like it was with Adam
[1:21:38] Eve was created when Adam
[1:21:41] was smitten
[1:21:43] in sleep
[1:21:45] Eve
[1:21:47] was the peace that was struck off of
[1:21:49] Adam
[1:21:52] Adam
[1:21:54] was smitten to make Eve
[1:21:57] she was the flaw
[1:22:00] from the Masterpiece of Adam
[1:22:07] Adam could not fall
[1:22:10] Adam could not be deceived
[1:22:14] but he fell so that Adam could play the
[1:22:17] part of Christ
[1:22:19] every Demon's bride Adam could not be
[1:22:22] complete without Eve
[1:22:25] Eve cannot be complete without Adam
[1:22:31] let's go on
[1:22:34] the masterpiece
[1:22:36] let us not forget that in the beginning
[1:22:38] when he smote the sight of Adam
[1:22:41] he took something from his side
[1:22:45] the smiting of Christ was for a Cause
[1:22:50] that he might take from him one to be a
[1:22:53] family the bride
[1:22:55] he might take him a bride why was Christ
[1:22:57] smitten
[1:23:00] what is the flaw that was in the
[1:23:03] masterpiece
[1:23:06] that he might take him a bride
[1:23:09] so when his Masterpiece was perfected
[1:23:14] then he had to Smite it
[1:23:18] to take from him not another piece not
[1:23:21] another creation but of the same
[1:23:23] creation
[1:23:27] my brother don't think bad at this but
[1:23:29] think a minute if he took from him the
[1:23:32] original creation to make the bride for
[1:23:34] him he never made another creation he
[1:23:37] took a part of the original
[1:23:40] creation then if he was the word what
[1:23:43] must the bride be
[1:23:46] it's got to be original word Living God
[1:23:49] in the word it's the original life the
[1:23:53] original seat it's the original word
[1:23:56] that's why that spoken word
[1:23:59] is the Original Seed
[1:24:03] that's why you believe it
[1:24:10] the image of Christ was smitten at
[1:24:12] Calvary
[1:24:14] God's Great remedy and Masterpiece for
[1:24:17] the penalty of sin
[1:24:20] he was without sin was made sin for us
[1:24:25] he that was without spots or blemish
[1:24:29] was slain for our sins
[1:24:34] watch this now brother Branham goes on
[1:24:37] we're still in the masterpiece
[1:24:41] all the prophets had flaws
[1:24:45] all the ones was apportioned
[1:24:48] but here at last coming up through that
[1:24:51] finally comes the Masterpiece the
[1:24:54] perfect one no fault in him at all
[1:24:58] so perfect reflected of the Builder
[1:25:01] himself his own image was reflected in
[1:25:05] his work Grodd and Christ are one
[1:25:17] Michelangelo
[1:25:18] rather
[1:25:20] was a Sculptor
[1:25:22] work
[1:25:24] that was dead because it had made of
[1:25:26] stone out of stone
[1:25:28] but here the master builder
[1:25:31] when he got his hand he worked perfected
[1:25:40] he steps into it
[1:25:46] oh I love that
[1:25:48] only a prophet of God could take these
[1:25:52] things and then there before our
[1:25:54] wandering eyes show us how that God
[1:25:58] would make a masterpiece
[1:26:02] and how he would step into the
[1:26:04] masterpiece
[1:26:06] no wonder that God smote him in Calvary
[1:26:09] and said speak
[1:26:14] that's what Jesus did
[1:26:16] he was smitten of God Afflicted he was a
[1:26:19] man acquainted with grief and sorrow why
[1:26:22] because it was our sins that put him on
[1:26:25] the cross
[1:26:26] it was our flaws that he died for it was
[1:26:30] our flaws that made him the masterpiece
[1:26:35] do you understand oh how I love him
[1:26:38] today
[1:26:39] [Music]
[1:26:43] why he became me
[1:26:46] that I might become him by grace
[1:26:51] without a flaw there would be no need of
[1:26:53] a savior
[1:26:55] without a flaw there would be
[1:26:58] no need of a redeemer
[1:27:02] without a flaw of sickness and and
[1:27:06] things in our lives there would be no
[1:27:08] need for a Healer
[1:27:12] you would need no masterpiece
[1:27:19] in the sermon Hebrews 57
[1:27:24] and then there was no man to till the
[1:27:26] soil
[1:27:28] Genesis 2.
[1:27:30] he had done made male and female but
[1:27:33] there's no man to till the soil
[1:27:36] then God made Man Out of the Dust of the
[1:27:38] earth gave him a hand like a chimpanzee
[1:27:42] give me my foot like a bear
[1:27:45] he made him on the image this Earthly
[1:27:48] body
[1:27:50] is in the image of animal life
[1:27:55] and it's made out of the same kind of
[1:27:58] material
[1:27:59] your body is made up just to the same
[1:28:02] kind of material a horse or a dog or
[1:28:04] anything like that
[1:28:05] it's made out of calcium potash
[1:28:08] petroleum Cosmic light
[1:28:11] All Flesh like that is not the same
[1:28:13] flesh it's different flesh but it's made
[1:28:16] out of the Dust of the Earth where it
[1:28:18] come from
[1:28:19] the difference between an animal and a
[1:28:22] man God put a soul in a man and he
[1:28:26] didn't put it in the animal because the
[1:28:29] soul that was in the man is that
[1:28:33] theophany
[1:28:43] let that sink down
[1:28:46] chew on that a while
[1:28:48] one day I'm going to take a step
[1:28:52] why do you like that song not because
[1:28:54] it's got a beat not be no because
[1:28:56] there's truth to it
[1:29:01] now listen to this brother Branham said
[1:29:04] the serpent had no soul
[1:29:09] he had a place for a soul nowhere
[1:29:12] there's only two quotes where brother
[1:29:14] Brown said the serpent had a place for a
[1:29:17] soul
[1:29:18] but it says he had no soul
[1:29:21] now Lucifer had a soul
[1:29:25] and the soul that sinneth
[1:29:29] that Soul shall die
[1:29:32] are you understanding
[1:29:34] so now
[1:29:35] Lucifer
[1:29:38] he enters into a body
[1:29:41] that is a beast body
[1:29:43] it's an animal body has no soul
[1:29:48] but it's so close it is the missing link
[1:29:51] between man and Beast now the prophet of
[1:29:55] God says now you watch
[1:29:57] he says you take away the spirit of God
[1:29:59] on a man and he's nothing but a brute
[1:30:01] Beast
[1:30:03] oh you call him a gentleman he says that
[1:30:06] same man would ravish a woman throw her
[1:30:09] her child against the wall ravish her
[1:30:12] and be like a brute Beast he said he
[1:30:15] might be 250 pound muscles and
[1:30:18] everything and not announce a man any
[1:30:20] and I'll tell you what that's being
[1:30:22] played out in this day let me tell you
[1:30:24] have all kinds of these muscle men and
[1:30:27] everything and what they are they're
[1:30:28] nothing but a bunch of queers
[1:30:32] perverted fleshly brute beasts
[1:30:45] serpent did not have a soul
[1:30:51] so it takes a man to be born again to
[1:30:53] take away the carnal lustful nature that
[1:30:56] we were born with
[1:30:59] you don't have to teach a little child
[1:31:01] to sin it's their nature
[1:31:04] you don't have to teach him how to to to
[1:31:07] be Bob to to music put on any kind of a
[1:31:11] music in front of a little baby who's
[1:31:13] never heard it before white black red it
[1:31:17] don't matter
[1:31:18] you put that beat before him
[1:31:21] and pretty soon
[1:31:24] yeah I Was Born to Boogie
[1:31:27] that's because of the nature
[1:31:31] huh that's because of the nature of your
[1:31:35] first husband which had a rule over you
[1:31:38] he was your nearer Kinsman
[1:31:42] oh do you understand because man fell in
[1:31:46] the flesh there was a nearer Kinsman who
[1:31:49] was it
[1:31:52] Lucifer
[1:31:54] who had control or came in and he
[1:31:57] interjected seed
[1:31:59] and do that Godly race and when it did
[1:32:02] it mixed the seed all down Through the
[1:32:05] Ages
[1:32:13] Eve was the byproduct
[1:32:18] that was made with a flaw
[1:32:20] so that the Masterpiece would have a
[1:32:23] purpose
[1:32:31] cause
[1:32:33] the very reason for him to be a
[1:32:36] masterpiece
[1:32:37] was because there was somebody who had a
[1:32:40] flaw
[1:32:41] and he said I need to be Jehovah Jireh
[1:32:47] there are people that have no peace
[1:32:51] I am Jehovah shalom
[1:32:54] there are people that have no
[1:32:56] righteousness I become Jehovah their
[1:32:59] righteousness
[1:33:02] do you see and I want all of you to
[1:33:04] understand that the seven Redemptive
[1:33:06] compound names of Jehovah every time you
[1:33:09] have a situation you can reach up and
[1:33:12] pull huh one of the pull down tabs of
[1:33:16] God's Great computer of his eternal
[1:33:20] thoughts and pull down I need some peace
[1:33:23] Hallelujah I need some peace so
[1:33:26] therefore I can pull on Jehovah shalom
[1:33:29] in the midst of my trials and
[1:33:32] tribulation I have a peace that passes
[1:33:35] all understanding
[1:33:43] I need a shepherd
[1:33:45] and we like sheep of gold gone astray
[1:33:50] therefore I can call
[1:33:52] on Jehovah
[1:33:55] he is my shepherd
[1:34:00] every sheep needs a shepherd
[1:34:07] without the flaws
[1:34:09] of all of God's children
[1:34:12] there would be no need for a masterpiece
[1:34:17] it is that need
[1:34:19] it is that flaw it is that failure
[1:34:25] that brought about the masterpiece
[1:34:29] that's why brother Branham said
[1:34:32] it was the flaw
[1:34:34] that made it the masterpiece
[1:34:38] oh do you know this masterpiece
[1:34:41] you who are flawed in your body with
[1:34:44] your temper and your complexes and your
[1:34:47] all of your kind of issues the lust of
[1:34:49] the Flesh and the pride of life and the
[1:34:52] the lust of the eye and all of these
[1:34:55] things do you know that Masterpiece that
[1:34:59] when you are having a time of trouble
[1:35:02] and trials in your life that you can
[1:35:05] look to him the Masterpiece and he
[1:35:08] what's bruised for your iniquity he was
[1:35:11] he was chastised for your peace
[1:35:16] by his stripes
[1:35:20] [Applause]
[1:35:20] [Music]
[1:35:23] you were healed
[1:35:31] the Bible says Romans 3 23 for all have
[1:35:35] sinned they should come short of the
[1:35:37] glory of God
[1:35:38] all have sinned
[1:35:40] you were born into it
[1:35:43] Romans 6 23 for the wages of sin is
[1:35:46] death but the gift of God is eternal
[1:35:48] life
[1:35:49] through the masterpiece
[1:35:56] Romans 5 verses 12 through 21 wherefore
[1:36:00] as by one man sin entered into the world
[1:36:04] and death by sin and so death passed
[1:36:07] upon all men
[1:36:09] for that all have sinned
[1:36:15] for until the law sin was in the world
[1:36:17] but sin was not imputed when there was
[1:36:20] when there is no law
[1:36:22] nevertheless death reigned from Adam to
[1:36:24] Moses
[1:36:25] even over them that had not sinned after
[1:36:28] the similitude of Adam's transgression
[1:36:31] who is the figure of him that was to
[1:36:33] come
[1:36:35] but not as the offense so also is the
[1:36:38] free gift
[1:36:40] for if through the offense of one many
[1:36:43] be dead
[1:36:45] much more the grace of God and the gift
[1:36:48] by grace
[1:36:49] which is by one man Jesus Christ hath
[1:36:53] abounded unto many
[1:36:57] and not as it was by one that sinned so
[1:37:00] is the gift for judgment was come
[1:37:03] was by one to condemnation but the free
[1:37:07] gift is of many offenses unto
[1:37:10] justification
[1:37:11] for If by one man's offense death
[1:37:14] reigned by one
[1:37:18] much more they which receive the
[1:37:20] abundance of Grace and of the gift of
[1:37:23] righteousness shall reign in life
[1:37:26] by one Jesus Christ
[1:37:30] oh the power
[1:37:32] of one
[1:37:36] brother Branham said you
[1:37:39] with him
[1:37:41] become the majority
[1:37:44] the power
[1:37:46] of one
[1:37:54] Verse 18 therefore as by the offense of
[1:37:57] one judgment Came Upon all man to
[1:37:59] condemnation even so by the
[1:38:01] righteousness of one of the free gift
[1:38:04] came upon all men unto justification of
[1:38:07] life
[1:38:09] for as by one man's Disobedience many
[1:38:11] were made sinners
[1:38:13] so by The Obedience of one shall many be
[1:38:16] made righteous
[1:38:18] I'm over the law entered and the offense
[1:38:20] might have bound but when where sin
[1:38:22] abounded Grace did much more abound
[1:38:28] that in sin hath reigned unto death even
[1:38:32] so might the grace Reign through
[1:38:36] righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus
[1:38:39] Christ Our Lord
[1:38:47] because one sinned all became sinners
[1:38:51] and because one obeyed
[1:38:54] all became righteous
[1:38:59] death to self separates you from your
[1:39:02] first Kinsmen
[1:39:05] not a divorce
[1:39:07] you don't just put him away
[1:39:09] but a death is what separates you from
[1:39:12] your first husband because even in your
[1:39:13] vows you say unto death
[1:39:17] do we part
[1:39:19] now watch this brother Branham takes a
[1:39:21] sermon called The Invisible Union
[1:39:24] of the bride of Christ
[1:39:27] the invisible you somebody say invisible
[1:39:31] it's in a supernatural Realm
[1:39:35] now he says your first husband that had
[1:39:38] rule over you was your Nature by natural
[1:39:41] birth
[1:39:43] natural you love the world because you
[1:39:46] are
[1:39:47] the world and part of the world that's
[1:39:49] right
[1:39:50] your desires was by nature to love the
[1:39:52] world which you're a part of you're part
[1:39:55] of nature you believe that
[1:39:57] that's a natural thing that's a reason
[1:40:00] you have to be born again
[1:40:02] you have to separate you have to die to
[1:40:06] your first husband you can't live with
[1:40:08] it you just can't say well I'll divorce
[1:40:09] him hang him up till the another
[1:40:11] occasion no writing a divorcement he
[1:40:14] dies
[1:40:16] the nature of the world has to die every
[1:40:18] Speck of him has to die you have to be
[1:40:21] reunited again with another nature
[1:40:27] now if your first husband
[1:40:29] had rule over you and that was
[1:40:32] by Nature
[1:40:33] now if he ain't going to die until he's
[1:40:36] thrown into the Lake of Fire
[1:40:39] and he's done away with
[1:40:41] then you don't give him no writing of of
[1:40:44] divorcement there's still got to be a
[1:40:46] death because you are united to him
[1:40:49] until death so who's going to die
[1:40:56] he who seeks to save his life shall lose
[1:41:00] it but he who seeks to lose his life
[1:41:03] shall find it is that right
[1:41:05] so now you understand the only thing
[1:41:08] that separates you
[1:41:10] from your first union now young people
[1:41:13] and some of you older ones if you've
[1:41:15] never had the new birth I want you to
[1:41:17] understand
[1:41:18] you can teach the young people knowledge
[1:41:23] of God you can teach young people things
[1:41:27] about God you can teach them they can
[1:41:31] sing the songs Jesus loves me this I
[1:41:35] know for the Bible tells me so they can
[1:41:39] go to Sunday school class they can learn
[1:41:41] of the a burning bush they can learn
[1:41:44] about Moses they can learn all of this
[1:41:46] they can go to church they can become a
[1:41:48] church member they can sit there and and
[1:41:50] feel the anointing of God and still not
[1:41:53] know him
[1:41:59] you must be born again
[1:42:05] the natural carnal life out of a kid
[1:42:09] I'll tell you what you were that kind of
[1:42:11] thing again I'll beat you out just nah
[1:42:14] you know what a child that is often
[1:42:16] reproved and rebuked hardened his neck
[1:42:21] don't you tell me and tell you what I
[1:42:23] just can't wait until I get out of here
[1:42:28] no wonder some of our kids are having
[1:42:30] such a rebellious spirit
[1:42:32] because Mom and Dad
[1:42:34] you don't beat it out of them
[1:42:44] oh yeah
[1:42:45] you bring him to church you pray
[1:42:48] and you seek God that one day
[1:42:51] they'll have an experience with God
[1:42:54] and the old Jacob nature we changed and
[1:42:57] he'll become Israel
[1:43:00] and saints of God I want you to
[1:43:02] understand every one of you know ye not
[1:43:04] you must be born again because to be
[1:43:07] carnally mind is is enmity with God
[1:43:09] neither can you know the things of God
[1:43:11] therefore Marvel not Nicodemus
[1:43:15] when I tell you a man must be born again
[1:43:17] how is it do I enter back into my
[1:43:20] mother's womb no that which is born of
[1:43:22] the flesh is flesh but that which is
[1:43:25] born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not
[1:43:29] ye
[1:43:30] when I say A man must be born again
[1:43:38] even with the new birth you're not
[1:43:40] completely rid
[1:43:42] of this old
[1:43:44] carnal man
[1:43:45] Paul said I've got to crucify him on a
[1:43:49] daily basis
[1:43:55] Romans 7 verses 18 through 25 I know
[1:43:58] that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth
[1:44:02] no good things
[1:44:04] for to will is present with me
[1:44:07] but how to perform that which is good I
[1:44:10] find not
[1:44:13] for the good that I that I would I do
[1:44:17] not
[1:44:19] but the evil which I would not that I do
[1:44:23] and if you ever had that
[1:44:28] I find in a law
[1:44:31] that when I would do good evil is
[1:44:35] present with me
[1:44:37] for I Delight in the law of God after
[1:44:39] the inner man but I see another law
[1:44:44] a law in my members worrying against the
[1:44:47] law of my mind
[1:44:49] and bringing me into captivity to the
[1:44:51] law of sin which is in my members
[1:44:55] oh Wretched Man
[1:44:57] that I am who shall deliver me from the
[1:45:01] body of this death
[1:45:03] I think God through Jesus Christ Our
[1:45:06] Lord so then with the mind I myself
[1:45:09] serve the law of God but with the flesh
[1:45:12] the law of sin
[1:45:15] the Holy Ghost baptism is only the
[1:45:18] earnest of your inheritance
[1:45:20] you do not get the fullness of it until
[1:45:23] when the first resurrection
[1:45:29] blessed are those who are partakers of
[1:45:31] the first resurrection
[1:45:33] brother Graham said that's the time when
[1:45:35] you get a change of this body why
[1:45:37] because the body that you're living in
[1:45:39] right now God will not allow that sinful
[1:45:42] byproduct to go into his presence
[1:45:45] no sir it's got to be changed in a
[1:45:48] moment in a twinkling of an eye guess
[1:45:51] what the this old Mortal body is going
[1:45:54] to put on a different kind of a body
[1:45:56] Hallelujah and theophany is going to
[1:45:58] envelop itself into this and you're
[1:46:01] going to be changed in a moment in a
[1:46:03] twinkling of an eye you're going to be
[1:46:05] changed and you're going to be like him
[1:46:08] Hallelujah you'll be able to come into
[1:46:10] the presence of God why God has changed
[1:46:13] you but until that time
[1:46:21] this old stinking flesh gonna be with
[1:46:23] you all the time
[1:46:25] and we've got to crucify the Flesh on a
[1:46:28] daily basis
[1:46:31] somebody say daily
[1:46:33] amen
[1:46:40] let's look at what brother Brown says
[1:46:42] about this Great Masterpiece let's
[1:46:44] continue
[1:46:46] his toils and wearys and long nights
[1:46:49] housed away from the world for days
[1:46:52] maybe eat a sandwich he's talking about
[1:46:54] Michelangelo
[1:46:56] and he rub on it and get back and now
[1:46:59] that's just not the way it was
[1:47:02] now it's got to come down to this and
[1:47:05] rubbing it
[1:47:07] then when he saw it just perfect
[1:47:09] then he saw it in reality
[1:47:13] the negative of what was in his mind had
[1:47:16] become real
[1:47:18] it became positive
[1:47:20] therefore it sprung into him and it was
[1:47:23] so real
[1:47:25] that he must cry out speak
[1:47:27] to me it was a reflection
[1:47:30] look at this
[1:47:32] because a woman is a reflection
[1:47:38] it was a compliment
[1:47:40] she compliments
[1:47:42] him
[1:47:45] it was a compliment to his work
[1:47:48] that his own work was so inspired him
[1:47:52] that it would become he would become
[1:47:55] beside himself to Smite it to say speak
[1:47:58] but it was the flaw
[1:48:01] that made it the masterpiece
[1:48:05] without the flaws in humanity there
[1:48:08] would be no need for a savior
[1:48:12] if there was no sickness in our flesh
[1:48:14] there would be no need for a Healer
[1:48:18] if there was no sheep that ever was lost
[1:48:21] there would be no need to send a
[1:48:23] shepherd
[1:48:25] I came he said to seek and to save that
[1:48:28] which was
[1:48:30] lost
[1:48:32] my sheep hear my voice
[1:48:36] if there was no war
[1:48:39] there would be no need for him to send
[1:48:41] peace
[1:48:44] if we had our own righteousness
[1:48:48] there would be no need for God to give
[1:48:51] us his righteousness but the Bible calls
[1:48:53] our righteousness is as filthy rags
[1:48:58] you can't never be good enough
[1:49:03] so God is not looking at your flaws and
[1:49:06] your failures
[1:49:09] God is not looking
[1:49:11] at all of these faults and flaws that
[1:49:14] you have
[1:49:16] it was all of your flaws mistakes that
[1:49:18] makes him good
[1:49:24] do you understand that
[1:49:27] it was the flaw
[1:49:30] that made the Masterpiece what it was
[1:49:35] those flaws
[1:49:38] that you have in your life at some time
[1:49:41] will activate or need to activate
[1:49:44] one or more of the seven Redemptive
[1:49:47] names of Jehovah
[1:49:52] and we've made a bunch of these copies
[1:49:56] here for the church and if you don't
[1:49:58] have this I want you to get it and ask
[1:49:59] these deacons because we've got several
[1:50:02] hundred
[1:50:03] so all of you should get a copy of this
[1:50:05] and I want you to keep it in your Bible
[1:50:06] and it'll show you the places where you
[1:50:09] can find Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Rafa
[1:50:12] Jehovah Nissi Jehovah Shalom it'll show
[1:50:15] you it'll show you the places where God
[1:50:17] came down and what he did he said I'm
[1:50:19] Jehovah when Abraham needed to sacrifice
[1:50:21] God came down and provided for him a ram
[1:50:24] and the ram was cut caught in the
[1:50:27] thickets Hallelujah do you understand
[1:50:29] that what God was doing was coming down
[1:50:32] and providing God was Jehovah Jireh and
[1:50:35] so therefore Abraham said this I call
[1:50:38] this place Jehovah Jireh God who
[1:50:42] provides how many of you have had God
[1:50:44] come down and you know supernaturally
[1:50:47] Jehovah Jireh he gave you a house he
[1:50:50] gave you a job he gave you a wife
[1:50:53] Jehovah Jireh he provided he got it and
[1:50:56] he brought it down to you and he said
[1:50:58] here I am
[1:51:01] I'm Jehovah Jireh
[1:51:04] I have provided this it wasn't you
[1:51:17] if there was no flaw there would be no
[1:51:19] need to be redeemed back
[1:51:24] if there was no flaws there would be no
[1:51:26] need for a masterpiece
[1:51:30] God is a Waymaker God is a provider
[1:51:34] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:51:36] forever
[1:51:38] this flawed kingdom here on Earth will
[1:51:40] not last much longer it is becoming so
[1:51:42] flawed right now you can see it this
[1:51:45] kingdom is so quickly the minds of the
[1:51:48] people today are becoming so corrupt
[1:51:52] that the spirits demon spirits
[1:51:56] from Down Below have now interpenetrated
[1:51:59] into this realm until they're acting
[1:52:02] like their father the devil and his
[1:52:05] works
[1:52:13] have you noticed all of these squatters
[1:52:15] that are
[1:52:17] getting into people's houses now
[1:52:20] better not go on a vacation too long you
[1:52:23] people that go for a month I'll tell you
[1:52:25] you come back you might have somebody in
[1:52:26] your home
[1:52:28] so therefore
[1:52:30] you better put somebody in your house
[1:52:31] while you're gone
[1:52:34] squatter
[1:52:36] he said Satan's a squatter
[1:52:38] he has squatted on the territory and
[1:52:41] said it's mine I'm going to be it and
[1:52:43] you know what he takes the laws of this
[1:52:44] land you can't get me out of here
[1:52:49] but God is a Waymaker
[1:52:53] [Music]
[1:52:55] the great leaders of the world today are
[1:52:57] talking about a great reset
[1:53:00] how they want to reset everything
[1:53:03] well I'll tell you what God's beat him
[1:53:06] to the punch
[1:53:07] God is going to do a great reset
[1:53:10] God is fixing to take this flawed
[1:53:13] Kingdom and push it right out and bring
[1:53:16] us a kingdom that cannot be moved he's
[1:53:19] bringing us a king and a kingdom that
[1:53:22] has no flaw he's bringing us back to
[1:53:25] Eden he's bringing us back because Adam
[1:53:28] and Eve
[1:53:30] they never finished
[1:53:33] their time in Eden
[1:53:36] he was cut off and the day you eat
[1:53:39] this is the day you dry
[1:53:42] so God said I'm gonna bring it back I'm
[1:53:45] going to take this Adam
[1:53:47] and I'm going to take deceive and I'm
[1:53:49] going to bring them back to Eden and
[1:53:51] what God is doing is he's spoiling
[1:53:54] the devil's eating
[1:53:58] as Satan got to the first Eve and got to
[1:54:01] her by reasoning
[1:54:03] and spoiled the first Eden and they were
[1:54:07] cast down
[1:54:08] God comes down in the midst of Satan's
[1:54:11] Eden
[1:54:13] and he doesn't seduce
[1:54:16] no he just speaks his word
[1:54:19] and when he speaks his word he comes
[1:54:22] down and and takes a woman
[1:54:27] a woman elect of God
[1:54:30] a woman that's not forgiven
[1:54:33] but as though she never did it
[1:54:44] Satan took the
[1:54:47] first woman and because of reasoning
[1:54:51] and spoiled the first Eden so God
[1:54:55] it's just vice versa on the devil
[1:54:58] he said I'm coming down in the midst of
[1:55:01] the worst of the worst of all
[1:55:03] generations when they're poor miserable
[1:55:06] blind wretched and naked and don't know
[1:55:09] it and I'm coming down and I'm going to
[1:55:11] take a woman
[1:55:13] right out of his Eden
[1:55:17] and it won't be by reasoning it'll be by
[1:55:20] faith
[1:55:24] and the faith that you have
[1:55:26] is not of yourself it is a gift of God
[1:55:28] so this whole thing that God is doing
[1:55:31] it's him doing it it's him calling it's
[1:55:35] him giving the faith it's him calling
[1:55:37] you it's him taking you out of
[1:55:41] cnh
[1:55:45] because he's fixing to bring another
[1:55:47] kingdom
[1:55:50] that's why this Kingdom's falling apart
[1:55:52] it's got to
[1:55:55] Satan's nothing but a squatter
[1:55:58] in the sermon of Masterpiece brother
[1:56:00] random gone we see the conditions of the
[1:56:03] time
[1:56:04] we see the condition of the people we
[1:56:06] see the condition of politics
[1:56:09] we see the condition of the world it
[1:56:12] can't stand it's got to sink like the
[1:56:14] Titanic
[1:56:16] it must go down for theirs
[1:56:19] give room one nation gives room to
[1:56:22] another it has it falls and this Kingdom
[1:56:24] Must Fall and every other Kingdom give
[1:56:26] room to that Kingdom that's coming
[1:56:29] which cannot fall for we receive a
[1:56:31] kingdom that cannot be moved through
[1:56:33] this perfect image of God the
[1:56:36] masterpiece
[1:56:39] continuing on now here paragraph 81 the
[1:56:43] Masterpiece got down through the age
[1:56:45] hewing away
[1:56:46] by the Patriarchs
[1:56:49] and made his platform and brought them
[1:56:51] up from the different things that would
[1:56:53] lay the foundation upon upon this he
[1:56:56] began to build his word the prophets and
[1:56:59] then finally come out the perfect
[1:57:00] Prophet the perfect Foundation the
[1:57:03] perfect vision God had and now in order
[1:57:07] for this to speak he is the word and for
[1:57:10] the word was had to speak he must come
[1:57:14] into the image
[1:57:16] and then from the image to speak it's
[1:57:19] got to be smitten
[1:57:20] he comes into the image and then in
[1:57:24] order to speak
[1:57:25] the perfect Redeemer oh all the types of
[1:57:29] the Old Testament was met in him
[1:57:32] as I said the other day Jehovah of the
[1:57:34] Old Testament is Jesus of the new
[1:57:37] amen Brethren do we have a problem with
[1:57:40] the overhead
[1:57:43] I'm giving you the quotes I like the
[1:57:44] people to read them
[1:57:46] so if if there's no problem I'm going to
[1:57:49] go to the the quote here on expectation
[1:57:54] now here's an amazing thing that when I
[1:57:56] read my Bible I see all of the flaws and
[1:58:01] the problems and the failures of the act
[1:58:03] of the elect all the way from Genesis
[1:58:06] all the way down through
[1:58:08] I see Adam failed
[1:58:10] I see Noah field
[1:58:13] I see this one failed
[1:58:15] I see you Elijah had a temper and he
[1:58:18] curses children
[1:58:19] and six the the bear upon them and they
[1:58:23] eat them up he said that wasn't that
[1:58:25] wasn't a Godly nature that was a
[1:58:28] angry prophet he had an anger problem
[1:58:32] did any of you have an anger problem
[1:58:34] yeah I'm just like Elijah
[1:58:39] so flaws all kinds of flaws we're
[1:58:42] talking about saints of God let me kind
[1:58:44] of
[1:58:45] try to bring this down to a close
[1:58:47] the flaw
[1:58:49] is what made it the masterpiece
[1:58:57] when I read in my Bible I see all those
[1:58:59] who made mistakes and flaws that the
[1:59:02] elect had in their lives
[1:59:05] and I tell you what if you think that
[1:59:06] you are flawless just let somebody hang
[1:59:09] around you for a day or two and they'll
[1:59:11] see every flaw you got
[1:59:18] it sure don't take long either
[1:59:21] in the sermon expectation I'm going down
[1:59:24] I'm just going to find some flaws that
[1:59:27] that meeting I'll find some flaws of
[1:59:30] that preacher I'll bet you I can don't
[1:59:32] worry you'll get it
[1:59:33] the devil will show you plenty of them
[1:59:37] yes sir so which one of you is going to
[1:59:40] keep your Halo on right now and tell me
[1:59:42] you ain't got no flaws
[1:59:45] well I'll tell you what let them hang
[1:59:47] around you a little bit let them go to
[1:59:49] lunch with you let them ride in the car
[1:59:51] live in your house for a few days
[1:59:52] they'll find every flaw
[1:59:56] we have to got to be tied tried and
[2:00:00] tested
[2:00:01] to find out where our flaws are at
[2:00:05] yeah
[2:00:07] God allows you to see your own flaw
[2:00:09] just about the time you think you're
[2:00:11] doing pretty good he shows you another
[2:00:13] area oh
[2:00:15] thank you Lord
[2:00:19] I didn't know I
[2:00:21] you know I've been praying for patience
[2:00:25] but guess what when you pray for
[2:00:26] patience what do you get
[2:00:28] tribulation
[2:00:30] I quit praying for patience
[2:00:34] God I've got enough
[2:00:36] it's okay
[2:00:38] I'm good
[2:00:41] oh the Lord is so gracious to us
[2:00:45] it was the flaw that made the
[2:00:47] Masterpiece have a purpose
[2:00:53] in the mighty conqueror there's anything
[2:00:56] that makes it Christian lazy it's when
[2:00:59] they're on a flowery bed of ease
[2:01:02] we don't have
[2:01:04] it persecution enough
[2:01:08] we don't have it hard enough
[2:01:12] always at the chain always at the chain
[2:01:15] is the strongest at its weakest link
[2:01:18] a man under pressure is is
[2:01:21] when he excuse me a man under pressure
[2:01:25] is what he is when he's under pressure
[2:01:28] his real true characteristics will show
[2:01:31] when he's under pressure
[2:01:34] get him all riled stirred up
[2:01:37] and he had the real man Kim hunt
[2:01:39] got temporary little shorts though
[2:01:42] if he's Meek in general insurance you
[2:01:44] know put him under the pressure once God
[2:01:46] puts all his children under test to see
[2:01:49] whether there's any flaws in them
[2:01:56] how many of you last week saw some flaws
[2:01:59] in your life
[2:02:02] don't take long and God will show you
[2:02:04] just about the time you think you're
[2:02:05] doing good God will show you another era
[2:02:07] in your life that he needs to work on
[2:02:10] they all had floss
[2:02:13] in a identified Christ of all ages
[2:02:20] what David was what Moses was what
[2:02:23] Elijah was what all of it was in him
[2:02:26] dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily
[2:02:29] he was the god prophet
[2:02:31] he was god Jehovah became flesh in his
[2:02:35] own son raised himself a tabernacle
[2:02:37] manifest himself in all of the rest of
[2:02:40] them failed they had flaws
[2:02:43] but there's no flaw in him
[2:02:47] even God himself said this my beloved
[2:02:49] Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in
[2:02:51] that's right no flaw in him here ye him
[2:02:54] he was manifested God
[2:02:58] so where was the flaw
[2:03:02] in her
[2:03:09] where is the flaw today
[2:03:12] in her
[2:03:16] if you're honest
[2:03:19] and you're really honest with yourself
[2:03:21] you realize I am so flawed
[2:03:24] but I want I want to play this side of
[2:03:26] the record but I don't want to play
[2:03:28] predestination so much that you're just
[2:03:30] predestinating you can live any kind of
[2:03:32] life you want to no because that makes
[2:03:34] it nothing but a bunch of disgrace when
[2:03:37] it's all Grace and Grace Grace Grace and
[2:03:40] then you are not living the way you
[2:03:41] should live shame on you
[2:03:43] no the reason that you live the kind of
[2:03:46] life you do is because God Gave You
[2:03:48] Grace and you saw that you need a savior
[2:03:51] you saw that you need a redeemer you saw
[2:03:54] that you need those things
[2:03:59] you need a good look at yourself
[2:04:07] you see when a worshiper came to offer a
[2:04:09] lamb once a year
[2:04:11] and came to the high priest
[2:04:14] here's an amazing thing the high priest
[2:04:16] never looked at the worshiper
[2:04:21] he looked at the worshipers Lambs
[2:04:30] God's not looking at you
[2:04:33] he's looking at the lamb that you bring
[2:04:36] and a lamb is without spot
[2:04:39] or blemish the worshiper
[2:04:43] is the one with the blemish
[2:04:46] the lamb was without spot or blemish the
[2:04:50] Lamb of God was without he was the
[2:04:52] Masterpiece but what it makes
[2:04:55] the Masterpiece such a masterful thing
[2:04:58] is he could take all of our sins
[2:05:01] and our iniquities and our flaws upon
[2:05:06] him that's what makes him the
[2:05:10] masterpiece
[2:05:14] wow
[2:05:20] wow
[2:05:27] when we confess our sins
[2:05:30] and we place our
[2:05:32] hand on the lamp
[2:05:34] and he dies God is not looking at the
[2:05:37] believer
[2:05:38] he's looking at the lamb
[2:05:42] now here's a a scripture that I want to
[2:05:45] I had never seen this
[2:05:47] before until just the other day I want
[2:05:50] to share this with you Revelations 3
[2:05:53] verse 1 through 6.
[2:05:58] and unto the angel of the Church of
[2:06:01] Sardis Wright
[2:06:03] these sayings saith he that hath the
[2:06:05] seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars
[2:06:08] and I Know Thy works
[2:06:10] that thou Hast the name that thou livest
[2:06:12] and are dead Be watchful and strengthen
[2:06:15] the things which remain
[2:06:17] that are ready to die for I have not
[2:06:21] found thy works perfect before God
[2:06:24] interesting
[2:06:26] they're remember therefore how that thou
[2:06:29] Hast received and hurt and hold fast and
[2:06:31] repent
[2:06:33] if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will
[2:06:36] come on thee as a thief and thou shalt
[2:06:38] not know what hour I will come upon thee
[2:06:41] thou Hast a few names even in Sardis
[2:06:46] which have not defiled their garments
[2:06:48] and they shall walk with him in white
[2:06:50] for they are worthy he that overcome the
[2:06:53] same shall be clothed in white raiment
[2:06:55] and I will not block out his name out of
[2:06:57] the book of life but I will confess his
[2:06:59] name before my father before his angels
[2:07:01] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[2:07:03] the spirit says the church is so let me
[2:07:05] show you what the prophet of God has to
[2:07:07] say about I have not found thy works
[2:07:10] perfect before God
[2:07:12] seven Church ages brother Brown said now
[2:07:15] be careful and get this
[2:07:17] this is what the second verse that I
[2:07:19] read for I have not found thy works
[2:07:21] perfect before God do you know what the
[2:07:24] meaning of not perfect really is
[2:07:26] it's unfulfilled
[2:07:29] this age was an unfulfilled age
[2:07:32] it was just the start of getting back
[2:07:37] that is why the Bible called it
[2:07:39] Reformation not restoration
[2:07:42] it had started out in the doctrine of
[2:07:45] justification when Schmitz salvation was
[2:07:48] all of God
[2:07:49] oh how Luther preached the sovereignty
[2:07:52] of God and election he knew it was all
[2:07:55] of Grace he separated the church from
[2:07:57] rule by the ecclesiastical hierarchy he
[2:08:01] tore down the idols he cast out the
[2:08:04] confessions to the priest he denounced
[2:08:06] the pope it was wonderfully good as he
[2:08:09] started but God had said 1500 years
[2:08:13] before
[2:08:17] Luther
[2:08:18] you're going to start things but your
[2:08:22] age will see it all unfulfilled
[2:08:25] I'm leaving that
[2:08:27] to later
[2:08:31] I wonder who that later
[2:08:34] is
[2:08:35] hallelujah our god reigneth he knows the
[2:08:38] end from the beginning yes Luther was
[2:08:40] the messenger
[2:08:42] it didn't look like it
[2:08:44] as we examine the flaws
[2:08:47] but there was a man called Jonah he had
[2:08:50] flaws in his life too
[2:08:52] yeah he was a prophet though you and I
[2:08:56] might not want to say so on the basis of
[2:08:58] how he acted
[2:09:03] but God knows
[2:09:05] them that are his and he has his way
[2:09:09] just as he did with Jonah
[2:09:12] so let me tell you Jonah if you're in
[2:09:14] this group
[2:09:16] God knows how to get your attention
[2:09:22] he had his way with Luther in that age
[2:09:24] and he'll have his way
[2:09:26] until the consummation
[2:09:29] Hallelujah
[2:09:31] we can examine all the flaws of God's
[2:09:34] elect
[2:09:35] we can see that the flaws is what made
[2:09:39] him the masterpiece
[2:09:42] he became me
[2:09:44] that I might become him
[2:09:46] The Great Masterpiece became smitten for
[2:09:49] the sins and failures of the Bride it
[2:09:51] was the flaw that made it the
[2:09:53] masterpiece
[2:09:58] testimony upon the sea and I'm closing
[2:10:00] musicians if you come
[2:10:03] therefore all of us are born by sexual
[2:10:06] desire
[2:10:08] and blood in us or sinful blood
[2:10:11] through a perverted way of bringing
[2:10:12] children to the Earth
[2:10:14] God just spoke Adam come forward
[2:10:17] so the woman was not in the original
[2:10:19] creation she was a byproduct of man
[2:10:22] taken from the side of rib Adam's Spirit
[2:10:24] was both male and female both feminist
[2:10:26] and masculine in the spirit God
[2:10:29] separated and masculine from the
[2:10:30] feminist put the femination the woman
[2:10:32] and masculine and man see both Body
[2:10:34] Spirit they are one
[2:10:36] that's the reason when Sarah laughed at
[2:10:38] the angel she could not be like that God
[2:10:42] would have slew that woman right there
[2:10:45] but he couldn't hurt her
[2:10:47] because she's part of Abraham
[2:10:51] he'd hurt Abraham if he took Sarah
[2:10:55] that's the reason our sins today
[2:10:58] would be everyone condemned
[2:11:03] but God can't take us because if he does
[2:11:05] he hurts Christ
[2:11:08] we're a part of him we're the bride
[2:11:10] don't you see
[2:11:12] so Grace holds us in our mistakes until
[2:11:15] we can see better
[2:11:19] my last quote here
[2:11:22] the masterpiece
[2:11:24] the perfect image
[2:11:26] the God man
[2:11:27] God in Martha had changed from
[2:11:30] Supernatural to the vision the vision
[2:11:32] was projected into the
[2:11:35] image and the image was smitten so that
[2:11:38] the supernatural could taste the feeling
[2:11:40] of death God's perfect masterpiece
[2:11:45] he could not do it in Moses
[2:11:48] he could not do it in the prophets
[2:11:49] Isaiah who was sawed with saws till he
[2:11:52] was sawed to pieces
[2:11:53] he could not do it in the prophets that
[2:11:55] were stoned he could not do it because
[2:11:58] he couldn't feel it
[2:12:00] there was just a portion of him but in
[2:12:04] this perfect Masterpiece he was the
[2:12:06] fullness of the godhead bodily he not
[2:12:09] only
[2:12:10] project Moses he could project the
[2:12:13] entire being into this person and taste
[2:12:16] death for the whole human race God's
[2:12:20] perfect Masterpiece God so inspired by
[2:12:23] seeing it he become the Redeemer of all
[2:12:26] ages to speak for those in the
[2:12:28] backgrounds who had been before and now
[2:12:33] all promises was met in him he was the
[2:12:37] Perfection of the Perfection he was the
[2:12:39] types of all fulfilled in him our
[2:12:41] Kinsmen Redeemer in Ruth and Boaz our
[2:12:45] law Giver from Mount Sinai our Prophet
[2:12:47] from the Wilderness he come from the
[2:12:48] mount he come from the Willis he come
[2:12:50] from eternity and become man the perfect
[2:12:53] image
[2:12:55] you see the Masterpiece spoke on behalf
[2:12:57] of all of our sins and all of our
[2:13:00] failures and all of our flaws he became
[2:13:03] a perfect image of God's vision
[2:13:05] and God told him to speak
[2:13:10] he was smitten and Afflicted he was
[2:13:13] bruised for our iniquities
[2:13:15] now we can clearly see that the flawed
[2:13:18] masterpiece
[2:13:21] and we can see the flaw
[2:13:24] Ed is what made it the masterpiece
[2:13:29] a different direction I had never seen
[2:13:31] that before the prophet of God said it
[2:13:34] was the flaw
[2:13:35] that made it the masterpiece
[2:13:38] I want to say to all of you it is your
[2:13:41] flawed
[2:13:42] individual personality complex
[2:13:46] characteristic it is you the flawed
[2:13:48] individual that makes him the
[2:13:50] masterpiece
[2:13:52] oh aren't you glad you got a masterpiece
[2:13:59] God took him
[2:14:03] and laid upon him
[2:14:05] the sins
[2:14:06] of all of us
[2:14:10] oh you talk about a masterpiece
[2:14:15] he could take the very
[2:14:17] sting of death and Hell itself and place
[2:14:21] it into his bosom
[2:14:23] and he would take away all our sins all
[2:14:27] our iniquities everything we ever did do
[2:14:30] everything we thought about doing and
[2:14:32] everything that we will do
[2:14:36] he took it unto himself
[2:14:42] and he became
[2:14:45] me that I might become you
[2:14:50] do you see
[2:14:52] that Masterpiece this morning
[2:14:54] taking it from a different angle
[2:15:00] oh I thank God
[2:15:03] now I realize that
[2:15:06] when I try to goo do good evil is
[2:15:08] present with me and that which I don't
[2:15:09] want to do that I do and that which I
[2:15:11] want to do I don't do
[2:15:13] oh Wretched Man that I am
[2:15:16] who shall deliver me from this body of
[2:15:19] death
[2:15:20] tell you what saints of God there's
[2:15:21] coming a day
[2:15:22] [Music]

[2:15:28] theophany
[2:15:31] I tell you it's hovering around
[2:15:33] I'm hearing from it more and more
