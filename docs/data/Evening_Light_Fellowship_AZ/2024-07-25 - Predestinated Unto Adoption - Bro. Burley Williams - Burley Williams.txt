tonight had wonderful fellowship with him the Lord willing we will be streaming the services live up at Camp so I'm going to require of our brother Brethren to somehow post it up either on our website give it to Sister Linda spread it out to everybody so that they know the times and everything so if you want to be a part of it where you can stream it we bought some uh whatever technical stuff so the Lord willing the Lord willing yeah you know how technology goes but the Lord willing we'll be streaming the services amen we have brother Tony Murray here brother Tony come up here you're a pastor from New Zealand he and his family are here uh we've been together on some of the foreign field over there in vatu rode in the back of a truck one time going to some meetings and just uh known him for many years now brother Tony God bless you I welcome you in the name of the Lord bless God bless you yeah please greet the the Saints they want to hear something W God bless you each one you know we're a long way away from here and it's over in New Zealand where we are so we've come over to share some of your warmth but uh it gets a bit carried away I said the car was 125° somewhere we're were driving today so I don't know how you uh cope with that but we really were enjoying we've seen a little bit of scenery we're out at brother Micah's place here this afternoon and just enjoying some time together but you know there's Saints all around the world that are getting ready for the Rapture and uh you know the prophet said that we are his victory if you think about that that we are his victory what he is looking for as a people ready for his coming am mean he is longing as the husband to see his bride amen and he says we are his workmanship we can't do it we're his workmanship he's getting us ready amen so I'm looking forward to the meeting tonight so God bless you each one amen let's all stand together for the word of God let's sing that song Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord you can go to church you can read the word you can be religious you can keep his Commandments but until God opens your eyes once he's opened your eyes it's like that sermon that brother Brenham preached so many times s we would see Jesus amen amen that's our desire just to see another part of his word amen Lord take your word tonight open it up yes Lord to our minds and to our hearts anoint our eyes with the IV of understanding that we would know him cuz if he's an unknown God to you how can you serve me how can you serve somebody how can you love somebody you do not know amen amen but I'm just under expectation brother Burley here is with us and he's going to be ministering at our camp but but I'm glad you're here tonight brother Burley we want you to come let's sing this song now okay Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord let it be your prayer Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord I want to see you Lord I want to see you oh just open Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord I want to see you oh I want to see you oh to see you I am LIF it up shining in the light of Your Glory just pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy oh I want to see you I want to see let's just bow our hearts let us to desire of our hearts Lord as the prophet said many times we didn't come to be seen or to see each other but we come to see you yes and how are we going to see you today we'll see you in the word and we'll see you in your bride so we come here we humble ourself before you Lord and trusted in you that you would come and speak to the hearts of your children yes and we just have nothing to say within ourselves that's why we wait upon you Lord to give us something that can be given to your people and may Lord when we leave the service tonight we can say I see me in the scriptures I see me in this great Plan of Redemption I see my place I see where God is positioning me I see where God is working on me not not my wife not my children but me yes because that's where it starts Lord in us as an individual because this is not a group effort lord it's an individual race where each one of us have to have that personal relationship with you as it was on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit fell it said it set upon each of them so each one of them have their own personal relationship with you father and Lord that's the way that it has to be today and maybe oh God some of us we done possessed many things in our life and and placed and situations in our life that you put us and showed us where we're at but we all just like in the time of Joshua some had their inheritance then he said now you got to help your brothers to get theirs so that shows uh when we come to a maturity in our lives Lord we can look back and see where our brothers need help where our sister need help and what we can all help and benefit from one another so Lord we leave everything into thy hands tonight and we give you the glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you tonight it's good to be here in the house of the Lord yes sir uh we like to immediately go to the scripture Ephesians chapter one we bring you greetings from the church back home that my Deacon told me to greet you guys we just another portion of the body of Christ waiting on the coming of the Lord amen so we just thankful for the opportunity brother uh allow us to be here to uh share the words of Life With You amen I was just listening to what brother Tony said about the heat here I told but Ron you have to be born in a place like this to deal with this kind of heat it's just unbelievable but God bless you but there's a harder place we trying to escape this is just an air conditioning that place but we just think thank God the for able to be here that's right Ephesians chapter 1 and we'll go to verse three amen we'll just go to verse one I let to go to verse three I'm sorry blessed be the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we know the prophet said Heavenly plac in Christ Jesus is a believer's position in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen you may be seated and may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word and I like to turn to uh also turn to Ruth chapter 4 sister Sandy the church been lifting you up in prayer you like for you to know that amen how many you believe prayer changes thing if you believe it just receive it don't doubt it just believe it praise the Lord amen cuz you it's a beautiful thing once you pray God hear you instantly amen you might I think he did but he hears you instantly that's right praise the Lord that's what he told Daniel when you first prayed we heard you God heard you but we had to do a little fighting to get here but we're here now so uh we just believe in a all Miracle performing God that's right amen Ruth 4: 11 it said all the people that was in the gate and the Elder said we Are Witnesses the Lord make the woman is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah which too did build the house of Israel and do thou worthily in EPA and be famous in Bethlehem and let thy house be like the house of per whom Tamar baring to Judah of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman so Boaz took Ruth and she was his wife and when he went into her the lord gave her conception and she buried son amen praise the Lord uh we were just going try to uh take a thought tonight uh predestinated into adoption and my subtitle is Ruth amen uh I'm not as kind of quick as I used to be it take a little while to get off the Runway but we'll just see what the Lord will do and we ain't trying to bring you nothing new we just only bringing you what has already been preached by the messenger of this hour amen and you know when I look into the message uh I remember one place brother Brandon said that when he look into the word of God he said I want to see what's in it for me I'm the same way I want to see what's in it for me where I'm at and what God wants and to do in my life amen and when I look into the scripture that's what I want to see so I think for the message of the hour because uh the characters that been uh magnified upon in the scripture but about preaching on Ruth Esther different ones bringing out things in the book of Jeremiah all of the things that through years been overlooked but have now to us in this day been magnified so we can see that God has a story in every character amen it's a purpose for every character and then uh saying and the prophet tell us if you look into the Bible and don't see Jesus Christ you miss something go back and read it again because it's a messageer there that God wants to give us amen so I believe that we are in the time of adoption and I know some have different uh views and different approaches that they approach certain things those things are fine with me and I can only go by the way God revealed things to me you know we don't try to impersonate someone else we just uh preach how God just revealed things to us and and we apply these things to our lives and uh but I love the scripture in Ephesian when it said having predestinated us into adoption that that that just uh a powerful scripture to me he predestinated us into adoption and that tells me uh it's not what I look at myself and how I think about myself and what God had predestinated me to be now there's many teachings as I said about adoption uh some try to make it seem like it's a hard subject but to me it's a very simple powerful subject that simply just tell me uh that God has a predestinated position for me that something that's going to be fulfilled in my life in this day and age and the prophet says that uh uh every individual have to seek God themselves that God can reveal to them their purpose in life hey can we say Amen praise the Lord uh Only God Can reveal that to an individual right praise the lord we as pastors and we preach the word of God and and we know that adoption is actually a believer's position in Christ can we say amen and God has to reveal that to a person so we're going to look into some scriptures and uh and some quotes and just kind of work with this subject because Ruth is one of my favorite books and I look at the Ruth a person that could come out of such such a seemingly terrible life but yet be put into a place and position when I look at Ruth is so encouraging to me to know you can come from the worst of worst situations in life amen but yet God can put you back on board that's what I look at when I look in the Book of Ruth can we say Amen how that even in the genology of Jesus Christ he used bad women named there seemingly Tamar Ruth and all the names can we say praise the Lord Rahab God put all those things in there to let us know you can come from the worst but I can take what was bad make it good can we say Amen I'm a living witness of that praise the Lord I I heard a brother one time tell me one time he said one struggles that I have in life he said as a kid I never really done nothing wrong he said I hear people testify what God them delivered them from and done for them and he said I have mind battles and I'm like he said like I I've been a good kid all my life and what did God deliver me from I said well I can help you with that he deliver you from sin praise the Lord he delivered you from sin that's the big thing right there amen and that's what mess up a lot of young people when they hear testimonies uh uh God delivered me from smoking God delivered me from pornography God delivered me from all these things and some sit there but I've been in the message and what what what what what what what have I done where he set me fee from and then they give a curiosity maybe I need to go fall and try something then I can have a testimony let me tell you something your testimony God kept you that should be your testimony he kept you from doing those things to me that is in a greater testimony because he's a he's a god he's a keeping God can we say amen and I think that's one of the most beautiful things that to me is such a compliment to this message that you can be born again filled with the Holy Spirit and you can have that testimony he kept me no I didn't do that but he kept me from doing that and that's giving God the glory amen but we come from different walks of life and we got each one have a different testimony of something that God has done in their life and and it all comes to the end we give God the glory because he deserves all the glory and the praise amen so when I see this uh predestinated us until adoption amen and I really love the scripture which we know in the book of galatian when it speaks of uh of adoption when Paul deals with that subject he began to speak and I'm just going to kind of maybe quote it if I could find it real quick in galatian when Paul just kind of laid the foundation on these things he said now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differs nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all I really love that scripture uh we know Paul they always going back to how that a father his heart's desire that you know they got a kingdom which would be a a a land that a father would have and he would have servants upon him and so forth but that father's greatest desire that one day everything that he has accomplished he can pass that over to that son can we say amen that's his greatest desire but the scripture tells us if though he said that the heir as long as he is a child different nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all so that boy is walking around one day knowing all of this is going to be mine but I can't get it when I want it praise the Lord he can walk around his father's property and say Yep this is mine this is mine I'mma be over this be over this but it's not his decision or his choice when he gets it amen right praise the Lord but he said he different nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all so far in the father M he's just a servant he ain't no different than them but he's my son but his condition where he's in life he just got a servant attitude he's not ready for this make no difference how much he thinks he ready he said I know the boy ain't ready it's the same thing God do you and me sometime we think we ready for something we think we deserve something we think we deserve a position no you can want and deserve it all you want to is when God wants to give it to you yes can we say praise the lord it's when he wants to give it to you so we see this he said but he's on the tutors and governors until the time here's the scripture to the time appointed not of the child to the time appointed of the father other words the child can say Daddy I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready ready daddy said no it's when I say you're ready praise the Lord he's on the tutor he's on the governor all these things which we know what they would do uh I I did a little study upon it back in them times what a father would do he would get one of his most trustworthy servants that been up the him for years and that servant he'll realize that servant my servant know what I like he knows what I don't like and he would take that servant and put his child under that servant a faithful servant so that servant when he's uh taking the child out and the child is walking around and and I I don't think that that boy when they was teaching him he was up under governments and tutors I don't I think it was based upon a bunch of books that he read I think it was experience that he went through as that servant take that son out amongst all of the people and then he watched how the boy react and amongst the people how he responds I think that servant be watching all of that that's right and then the father come to the servant how did my son do today he said he didn't do too good he said all right cuz that servant had to tell the truth that's right he got he can't say I really like this boy so let me cheat for him or do some shortcuts for him so I can pleased the father no the servant had to tell the Father the truth cuz what that father was looking forward to that when he come to that servant how is my son when that servant would say your son thinks like you acts like you handles situations just like you and the servant said by the way he reminds me of you and then the father say now it is the time that I can pass a position I can pass all of this Authority to my son so now I can present him before the people and say here is my son hear ye him he thinks like me he talks like me see that's the whole whole whole uh scope of adoption being about the father's business not our business being about the father's business can we say praise the Lord so uh but remember brothers and sisters if there's no birth there's no adoption can we say praise to the Lord many want positions and positions and positions but don't want a birth that tutor is the holy spirit can we say praise the Lord so it must be must be born again first but a lot of people want to be Authority and power and and ain't got no character fit what they trying to say that they have God wants character can we is that all right better R I'm just going to preach with on my heart look I just preach I don't come to preach to try to impress your pastor or try to impress you I want to I got one person I want to impress amen that's him the Lord Jesus Christ when he can say good job son that's what I'm interested in cuz we can't get up into all of these personalities can we say Amen it's all about us coming closer and closer to the Lord Jesus Christ praise God so we let's just look into some things and follow along with me I want to go to Deuteronomy chapter 23 and uh we're going to look at uh Ruth life and try to build up some things if the Lord would help us Deuteronomy chapter 23 in verse two it says a bastard should not enter into the congregation of the Lord Lord even to his 10th Generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the Lord and an ammonite or moabit shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord even to their 10th Generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the Lord forever that's a strong scripture and it speaks of two groups of people that ammonites and the moabites which we know that Ruth was a moabit so she already been marked and label that she can't enter into the congregation of the Lord even to the 10th Generation praise the Lord so 10 generation had to pass by that for a moabit can even enter in are you with me so I find that very interesting but we talking about Ruth and we talking about predestination into adoption you know I go let me backtrack just a moment I love that word because when I look in my own life I know where my outcome is going to be and God going to make sure that I get there because I believe before the Rapture take place or either before God take a Believer life they are going to fulfill what he already predestinated in their life for it to be before that he takes them and it's not something that we're going to try to accomplish in ourself he knows when we get there but we strive to for Perfection that's what we do as an individual but Ruth is just the perfect person that could come out of a bad situation but look what she ended up being right in the lineage of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in this scripture right here which is a strong word but what I want to do I want to backtrack a little bit and try to run rof life down and then bring you and me on the scene because I'm thankful for the message of the hour cuz when we look at Ruth we should say me you should put yourself there what God done the Ruth we should say me cuz we are Ruth remember now that Ruth is a type of you and me but we are not a type of Ruth can we say Amen matter of fact the bride is not a type of nobody all of the other ones in the scripture types us but we type nobody we are the Bride of Jesus Christ but we can learn from all of these types what God had in mind about you and me praise the Lord now the scripture tells us that they can't enter into the congregation even until the 10th Generation but the scripture is so accurate how that every number everything in the Bible it has a meaning behind it sometimes we might not catch what the meaning is and the way I look at it if I don't catch what the meaning is of something it's simply because God don't want me to know it at the time because I know and got much confidence in him he every everything that I need at the time that I need it he'll make sure I get it amen that's why when somebody have a understanding on something I don't have an understanding that don't offend me because I know he's the only one can give me Revelation praise the Lord Flesh and Blood did not reveal these things unto you but my Father which is in heaven I said I know only he can give me Revelation and the thing that I know once he show it to me nobody can take it from me that's right Hallelujah can me say Amen man this message been revealed to me revealed it to me God revealed it to me that's why nobody can't talk me out of it nobody Tau me in it can't nobody talk me out of it amen praise the Lord I always tell my church when we witness when we testify we want to bring Jesus Christ on the scene don't try to talk somebody into coming to church that's right amen I said listen you talk somebody into the message with a hamburger somebody else will talk him out with a hot dog but if you can get them in and get a real relationship with Jesus Christ the same as way Paul took Timothy can we say Amen you remember Timothy what the brother B say look what Paul took Timothy he said that's what a True Believer will do when they get into them depths of God they'll go get another they'll go get another he'll referring to Billy Graham Billy Graham said I get three 30,000 Converse and came come back and find 30 he said what's the problem do the preacher sitting in there with the desk filled up on the de he said no my precious brother that's not it he said look what Paul Paul one and look what Paul through Timothy what Timothy began to do it's all about getting them to the Lord Jesus Christ that's the purpose can we say Amen cuz when you got that individual relationship with Jesus Christ if a group ain't with you you still serve God right if you by yourself you can serve God we're supposed to be Eagles can we say Amen Eagles don't fly in groots buzzers fly in groups buzzers depend on groups Eagles don't depend on groups when you see a eagle fly it'll be one or two he's by himself cuz he's still single amen or he don't got married he flying with his wife but they don't worry about groups so that should be the same with you and me this is a this is not a group effort you come to church to see Jesus Christ for yourself but if your your if your faith is built upon the church when the church fall you'll fall can we say Amen it's a individual race and that's the way that it has to be yes sir praise God but look at Ruth life you know there's no recorded scripture where you can actually some of you probably can but I couldn't find it well you can actually follow the generations how long Moab actually was because when you look at scripture and I want to point something out to you now we know brother Brandon said a generation heer to a generation as 40 right but that is not the case I know exactly what he meant but that is not the case of every generation in the Bible are you with me because sometime the Bible would say a generation plural then a generation singular so when you look in scripture you find Generations sometimes deal with ancestral generation or lineal generation now when he was speaking of 40 which is a generation he's speaking of a age that we are 40 is a generation are you with me so far this is not nothing contradictory what he said but I'm saying this for a purpose to show you even when you're dealing with Generations in the Scriptures it depend on what thought that you are bringing you have to line them things up are you with me cuz sometimes just using 40 toy to figure out a generation it don't work out mathematically many of times are you with me so now when we try to follow the generation of Ruth when would that 10th Generation was up I find one of the best Clues to go back to see where that was it's actually used the generation of Isaac because Isaac and Moab Moab kind of came on the scene at the same time are you with me you remember when Sodom and Gomorrah when it was burned that's when the lot daughters a man had a relationship with him right and it wasn't much after that that's when Isaac come on the scene so if we can follow Isaac genealogy his timing it'll give us a good idea with the generations of Ruth are we clear so far amen so now let's just go to this Genesis 19 verse 29 if you will Genesis 19:29 it said and it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which lot dwelt how many you believe you're the children of Abraham Sons and Daughters of Abraham God is expressing something even right here in the scripture how important that it is he didn't the Bible didn't say amen he remember lot he remembered Abraham what did he remember about Abraham the prayer that Abraham made for lot the intercession that Abraham was doing for lot so that takes me back to what the prophet said that the very same faith that you have for your salvation you can apply that to your family can we say amen that's powerful to me now they might even get worse children might get worse might go farther away loved one got go farther away it ain't what I'm looking at it's a promise that God gave me that I just keep them up in prayer and trusting God to deal with them cuz sometime because they going farther away that don't mean it's worse praise the Lord I like that so he said in God remember Abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which lot dwelt lot went out of zoah and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zah he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters and the firstborn said unto the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come into us after the manner of all Earth he come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father now this is me now I G this is where I see these things now there's many I know I hear a lot of preaching when they speak of the situation with lot and what happened here with his daughters some people that's got many things that they throw out they say look how abomino those girls was look how filthy this situation was look what they're doing they says they I hear some say they doing this because they've been down in Sodom so long and the spirit of Sodom fell upon them here are all sorts of things but if you look at in the scripture they was not doing this for filthiness they said preserve seed it wasn't something that they said well I want to just have a great uh relationship and do something that wasn't what the purpose was if we can look at Tamar life and seeing what she done was actually righteous why can't we even look in the scripture and see what was in their heart but yet we know in the sight of God it was an abominal thing because it deals with daughter and father so in the sight of God that's why he made that statement even to the T generation but yet on their part it was not for just sexual pleasure praise the Lord cuz here is where Ruth come from right here from this situation praise the Lord can we keep going notice verse 33 they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when she laid down nor when she arose verse 34 and it came to pass on the marrow that the firstborn said unto the younger behold I lay yester night with my father let us make him drink wine this night also and thou and go thou in and lie with him just that we may preserve seed of our father and this is where the nation of Moab and the ammonite was actually birthed praise the Lord but God was looking at something even greater than this and we're going to try to go and bounce through the scriptures a little bit then if you go to Genesis 21 we know this is after uh Solomon and gomorah was destroyed Genesis 21 verse one said and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah conceived bear Abraham a son in his old age at the set time in which God had spoken to him and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom Sarah bear to him Isaac so from Genesis 21 from Genesis 19 we uh we see that there's a we can get a close idea deal of the time Moab was born and when Isaac was born so if we can see the generation even of Isaac we'll have some kind of idea how Ruth her time came up now for her to come into the body of Christ I would say the body of Christ I know it say the house of God but I'm just saying into a position yet she come out of such a perverted thing from idol worship offering up babies and all this kind of thing and it was terrible but they not that that's wasn't what God was looking at he knew what her end would be praise the Lord I'm glad God look at it like that cuz some people I deal with they just terrible they are just terrible you like my God but then you think about yourself look what he did for you look what he brought you from that gives you Grace to deal with people and let them know that there is hope I don't care how you was born how you was raised what you went through but there is a God that can change every bit of that the very moment you give your heart to us that's praise the Lord amen so now we got Ruth we want to try to pray her on the scene for a moment now if you will turn with me to Matthew chapter 1 praise the Lorden there is an appointed time sir for each one of us thank you Lord and it's in God's timing praise God that's why I said Lord I I might not be where I want to be but I know one thing I'm going to get there cuz I believe I'm your son I'm your child and you promise you going to get me there I ain't going to get myself there you going to get me there praise the Lord Matthew chapter 1 I want you to notice now it said Abraham begat Isaac now let just kind of follow along with him for time sake I know I ain't GNA get finished but we're gonna try to get as much as we can in Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac begat who Jacob so after Isaac there's a generation we're going to see in verse it said no let me back up let's go to Matthew chapter 1 verse one if you notice it says here the book of the generation of Jesus Christ singular amen yes it didn't say plural it didn't say Generations now it's saying the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham now watch Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac begat who Jacob one generation Jacob begat Judas too and his Brethren Judas begat parz three and four and and and and Perez and zarra and Tamar four and Perez begat Isham five ishran begat Aaron six Aon begat ainad seven and Amad begat Nan eight Nan begat Solomon nine and Solomon got who Boaz 10 10 now we see Ruth come on the on the scene with boas right so now we see something had to happen now it was nothing in the time of Boaz there's nothing going to hold Ruth back now for getting to Boaz cuz in God uh the time is up amen praise the Lord all holes now been let loose but yet now God got to take Ruth to a process to get her where he need her to get to are you with me now let's turn to Ruth chapter one we're going to look at the beginning of Ruth personal journey and we're going to just follow it as the prophet brought us to the message kisman Redeemer amen let's backtrack a little moment now we know that when Israel when they rejected their Messiah we know according to the scripture that they had to reject him and by their rejection of him it brought salvation to us the Gentiles amen it been explained even through Jacob when he blessed uh J Joseph's son you remember he crossed his hand that they're showing us that the blessing going to come at the cross Israel being the older we being the younger but at the cross is going to bring Salvation to the Gentiles can we say praise the Lord and then we see all down through the scripture how these things have to be how that even Joseph had to be rejected Joseph had to be rejected for the purpose to go down into Egypt to get a gentile wife we see all of these patterns how the prophet told us all these things are just perfect now when Joseph was rejected it caused him to go down to Egypt to get him a gentile wife so when Christ was rejected by the Jews it now caused salvation to come to you and me is that right even Paul when he came on the scene he tried to go back to the Jews when they rejected he said it was needful for you to do this CU now L we go to the Gentile because that's God's pattern then we find Amen in Romans chapter 11 Paul said I don't want you to be ignorant of this thing that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentile come in are we with me so all of these things had to happen and God showing all these patterns and we're able to go back that's why as Gentiles we ought to be thankful because we know that the gospel can't go back to Israel until God is finished with us now look what Israel is doing now look what they're going through it's showing us how close we are to be getting up out of here but until the forness of the Gentile come in God can't deal with the Jews the way that he wants to deal with them so what is God waiting on now he waiting on this bride he waiting on you and me to get in order so the Rapture can take place so we see all of these patterns amen how had to be a rejection then we see the pattern amen when uh when the the prophet begin to bring in World War I World War II World War I there's never been a message like this to bring these things to our day to show you it was just not just Wars just to be a war but it's the tender hand of Jehovah amen praise the Lord I went over there and uh when all the war and stuff taking place in Ukraine I went over to Ria to share the gospel with some with a church they asked me to come a lot of ukrainians escaped and went to Ria I tell you when I went to the pull pit you you you you you you you feel all that pressure you just like what what can you say what can you do they don't escape to find Refuge there don't never know when they going to go back home they don't know I'm sitting at the pull pck hey how y'all doing but pressure pressure the only when something come to my mind I said I want to say one thing to you I said in the time of Hitler or what happened now could you imagine mentioning that to him and them and they already in pressure but I had to cuz that's what fell in my heart I said we have to remember in that time even when World War I and World War II and all these things I said a news reporter I said if a news reporter would have said this is the tender hand of Jehovah it wouldn't have meant nothing I said it took a prophet to go and say this is the tender hand of Jehovah and I said I want to tell y'all something I painful everything that y'all are going through this is still the tender hand of Jehovah and when I make those statement you can feel the pressure just leave to let them realize God is still in control a lot of things we don't understand but God is still in control cuz it's the tender hand of Jehovah amen and remember I I'll read the quote for you in a moment when he begin to bring things out in the message kid of Redeemer it's a beautiful picture after they rejected the Messiah we know then it brought them forth up to Luke 21 I believe it is when Jesus gave them a prophecy let them know don't go back and when you see Jerusalem is surrounded don't go back and get your stuff stay away amen he know that was a prophecy that Titus was going to come in ad70 he gave them that prophecy and the prophet said there was not one believer cing to that because they remember what Jesus said amen so we see after that the Bible tells us then they were scattered through all out of the world right but we know under the Feast of the trumpets recognizing your day in this message how the thing was taught to us how God had to get them to go back to Jerusalem so that he could deal with them he did it through the war war one World War I World War Two now what Theologian going to tie wo them three woes in the Book of Revelation to war you ain't going to find one God brought it to us today are you with me notice when they rejected Jesus that caused all of the problems when they said let his blood be upon us us and our children they spoke that but I'm so thankful Paul let us know in the Book of Romans he said Israel has not got what she looking for he said but the election has obtained that for her that go to show you that God have not forgot about them amen which is that 144,000 election done T that for her she's going to get what she's looking for God made sure he sealed it that where I will take care that 144,000 it's been sealed you and I peeping in the future amen what God is going to do we know exactly what he's going to do we thank God for that but why are we at right now and you remember how brother Brandon brought all these things out with the trumpets and so forth he's telling us no the trumpets is for the Jews the seals is for the Gentiles amen we look in the story of Joseph again when his brothers sold him out what did Joseph do go to Egypt get a gentile wife right but did God forget Joseph's brothers no they were just a part of the plan Amen to get Joseph to be sold into Egypt see that's when God positions Us in places that he wants us to be in sometimes it's painful you go through a lot of pain you go through a lot of hurt but God is behind that to put you into a place where he want to put you in when God was dealing with Joseph Joseph's brothers was was not on God's mind God mind was on Joseph he just used them as a tool to get Joseph where he need to get Joseph that's right are you with me when they sold Joseph what did he do he go into Egypt he get him a gentile wife we know that's a type when the Jews sold out the Lord Jesus Christ now he comes to get a gentile bride are you with me then we see in tight how that when Joseph everything that he went through we know the two thieves on the cross typ the the Baker and the butler down in uh in the dungeon with Joseph how Joseph was written up to his place of adoption and so forth by your need to Joseph we know that story yeah praise the Lord you know I tell you something friends when God puts you in a place but you can't get over hurt right and you keep living a life I can't believe people D me like this I can't believe I can't believe you ain't going to go no farther than that because that's what you believe you ain't going to go no further than that because Joseph you got to look at if there ever was a man had a right to pay his brothers back for what they done to him it was Joseph can we say Amen but look what God done to Joseph we look at Joseph when he comes up out of the Tomb I mean come up out of the dungeon sitting on the right hand of pharaoh we said why he's blessed but that was not Joseph's final test Joseph final test was now he got all power in his hands he got all of it in his hand all he had to do is tell them wipe something out they would have done it his final test when his brother sat right in front of him he got that power to tell them Egyptian wipe these guys out I don't want to see them they would have done it without a question but what Joseph final test was when he looking at his brothers when he realized you did not send me down here he said God s me down here you didn't do it God put me into this place that's why in our life we get to a place in our life it ain't what people done to me it ain't what people said about me just is God God Ming my character God allowed me to go through these things cuz he's working on me so you'll go no further than what you believe he was molding character in Joseph for power am think about the woman that told that lie on him if she was still alive husband come home you remember that man you told that lie on and he got put in jail she said yes I said now he said now he's on the right hand of pharaoh and here come Joseph bow the knee here come Joseph I see Joseph up on the Chariot and then she standing on us cuz she had to give respect to him too now she's out there and then Joseph looked at her she come on Joseph just say all is well cuz God was working on mejah praise the Lord God used people he used incident he even used used tragedies he used whatever he had to do to get to that believer so he can get them to the place that he wants them and God is so beautiful when he get a Believer to a place that he wants them to be then he can send them back to help the people that cause him problems amen that's right brother when God gets you where he wants you then he sends you back to the ones that cause you problems he done the same thing to Abraham lot called Abraham problems but when God got Abraham what he wanted him he sent him back to Rescue lot praise the Lord that's why he works on us first so he can use us the way that he want us to use us to be written Epistles to be ambassadors of Jesus Christ he got to deal with us first so we see all of these beautiful types the Jews Joseph Brothers they didn't realize it were the trumpets blowing on their life to bring them to Joseph same thing today the trumpets blowing on the Jews to bring them to meet Jesus Christ you remember the prophet talked about when they was getting on that plane they said what are you doing you going back to Jerusalem to die they said no we're going back to meet our Messiah they realize it's a move of God taking us back and that's what they're waiting on that 144,000 sometime people actually question now that 144,000 that Moses and Elijah is going to preach to uh you say going to be the Jews that's why they went back home yeah that's correct they said but look how old the people don't die nothing from out of the Holocaust how you going to tell me that's still 144,000 there I said friends be for real when they went back to Jerusalem the seed was in the men they got children they got something for God to come back and get I said god is perfect in the plan can we say Amen it's the same thing he told Jeremiah when they went down in Babylon what did God do sent them a letter why they would Lord have mercy God sued them a ladder while they was in Babylon before they went to Babylon they would listen to The Prophet but when they got in Babylon God still sent them a message he told Jeremiah to write I can't remember the brother name Jeremiah gave him a letter and Jeremiah said take this to and read it to them while they're in Babylon could you just imagine that brothers and sisters while they was in Babylon they didn't listen to The Prophet but now they send the letter to Babylon I can see some of them getting excited right oh Jeremiah wrot us a letter well listen now what what he say what he say what he say what he say oh this going to be encouraging tell us what Jeremiah said now I can guarantee to say see what it is God don't gave Jeremiah another revelation we ain't going to be down here too long so now Jeremiah going to let us know we going we going to get up out of here now hey man oh brother read it to us read it to us then he gets up there and say let your son marry daughters your daughter married Sons plant Vineyards build houses they're like huh on I'm in Babylon you're going to tell me to let my children get married plant Gardens and so forth like that yeah God didn't change his mind they wanted an encouraging letter that was the encouraging letter that I want you to still continue on yeah you you messed up but I'm not going to change my mind but God realized cuz they were so depressed they didn't even want to have family relations and God knew if they don't have family relation I ain't going to have nobody after these 70 years to come get so God said keep having children plant Vineyards then he said pray for the ones that got you in captivity that ain't no encouragement letter but it was what God want to give them that time cuz they their it was their fault they was there but God said my thoughts of you they are not evil they are good he said but I have an expected end for you amen that you will go back to Jerusalem that's the way God thinks about us not evil is good even though we go through hard time his thinking about us is good where did it start good before the foundation of the world in his mind he know exactly what everyone of us going to be praise the Lord he just got ways of doing things all of these types everything just lines up so beautifully everything will find its place just the way God seen it before the foundation of the world is going to fall into his slot you're going to fall in his place that's why as a minister I ain't got to do nothing manipulant to try to get it in the door to preach for somebody or be a buddy to try to get in somebody preach I don't have to do none of that because I know wherever God has ordained for me to minister that door going to open itself it's nothing that I have to do because the gifts make room for themselves so whenever you see somebody trying to manipulate or turn something so they can get it to a place they can get it to a position you that person don't have a revelation they're trying to do it and then the Prophet come right back he said the one that wants to do it so bad is not the one that God called didn't he say it praise the Lord now Ruth comes on the scene the Bible say Ru Ruth chapter 1 verse one I'm trying to I'm going try my best to try to wind it down Ruth chapter 1 verse one now it came to pass in the days when the judges rulle that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of Bethlehem Judea went to serjin in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was IMC and the name of his wife Na armi and the name of his two sons Mah chilion of epes Bethlehem Judea and they came into the country of Moab and continued there do you realize when that famine took place in the land when Naomi and her husband left Bethlehem Judea that is a type of them rejecting the Jews rejected Christ cuz when they rejected Christ it caused them to be scattered out into the land so that Grace can come to the Gen house so what's happening right here in the Book of Ruth this is kind of the same type what Naomi them and EM is doing they see that there's a little famine going on they said we we need to let's just B what did they do they scatter out to Moab but what they didn't realize their rejection was bringing salvation to Ruth got the 10 generation was up amen they in realiz they were walking right in the plan of God cuz God said I got Ruth on my mind I need to get Ruth where I need to get her and I need to do some moving around and then all of a sudden Livin that got a revelation we need to move no God was behind all of that lord it's the same pattern and then all of a sudden they get down into Moab when they get down there verse three in a lmon n Naomi's husband died she was left and her two sons they took them wives of the women of Moab the name of the one was Oprah and the name of the other Ruth they dwell there about 10 years and Malon and chilion died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons in her husband you notice when when when when uh when Naomi husband died she wasn't thinking about going back but when her sons died and she heard that God is visiting them giving them bread now she wants to go back can we say Amen what was happening here in Naomi's life is God blowing the Trumpets on her life the same that he done the Jews amen when our husband died that was her first woe right when her sons died that was her second woe the same as World War I the Jews weren thinking about going back but World War II they went back so now Naomi with her sons died which was her second W she said now it's time for me to go back home it's the exact same pattern because God was blowing the Trumpets on na Army but what was he doing the Ruth F to open the seals can we say Amen what is the seven seal the coming of the Lord who Ruth going to meet Boaz the lord of the Harvest so now they're walking they're moving together one under the seals one under the trumpets amen then the prophet comes on the scene what did he say he said the very time that when Israel was con consider a nation he said that was the same time the angel visit me to give me a commission what is he doing now placing Ruth and Naomi walking together he begin to preach Israel and the church amen begin to line everything back up to show you and me where we are [Applause] at but Ruth she could not start her journey she was placed in Israel but before she can get placed her first husband had to die God not an adulterer he know Ruth married the wrong one cuz the one that she married could not bring her back in the status of life he was backslid himself that's why you see R and Ruth had no children God kept that wound shut up cuz he knew Ruth need Royal seed Ruth need someone that can plant seed to bring restoration that's why our denomination of Life got to die can we say man denomination can't have Christ being formed in you but this message com but Christ can be formed in you yes sir so Ruth first husband had to die that's why you and I before we can start this journey this first man this old nature got to [Applause] die sir then after he died and the prophet begin to go into the phases Ruth deciding Ruth serving Ruth resting Ruth rewarding it he begin to bring it into a cycle that same pattern for you and me when we first start serving the lord we got to be willing see God crucify this old man this old nature just me I need to be crucified before I can even start I have to make the right final clear-cut decision just the same as Ruth did if you ain't got the Holy Spirit today it's simply I'm going be honest with you cuz you ain't made a clear-cut decision the prophet says this if you ain't got the Holy Ghost he said the reason why God has not honored your faith God has not seen your faith that's why he have not given you the Holy Ghost it so people going year after year I want the Holy Ghost I want the Holy Ghost I want the Holy Ghost let me tell you something friends when you are really yeah when you are really ready to die from yourself you can get the Holy Ghost yes sir but long as you still want part of you to live you ain't gonna get born again so Ruth you see when you start wanting to serve the Lord It's not the devil ain't going to make it easy on you that's right that's when pressure actually comes because he want to stop you from from being sealed pressure just comes everywhere so we see Ruth let me skip some of this let me read this quote then I'll jump it back in the prophet says this the kids Redeemer now Ruth was a pagan serve Idols so was Oprah they were on their road coming back with their mother-in-law because she heard that down in Bethlehem Judea that God had lifted the plague and the people was having bread I just want to put that part in he said they're on that road coming back yeah so we see when their husband died now they're on a road they're on a journey now going back amen so on this journey you got to First make the right decision to start so you can get on the journey are you with me but now watch this he said oh Opa was a type of the lukewarm church that once started he going to placed them in the journey Oprah is the one once started but didn't make it right but Ruth started and finished are we together let's go to Ruth chapter 1 ver8 verse eight says and Naomi said un her daughters-in-law go return each to her mother's house the Lord deal County with you as you have dwelt with the dealt with the dead and with me out of everything that they going through Naomi now trying to get rid of both of them return yeah see that's this Christian Journey yeah that's right the devil going to tell you return it's all right to go to church it's all right to sing it's all right to be a part of the church but still hold on to some of your worldly activities and your worldly desire hold on Naomi trying to get rid of her go back but you know in this right here they both passed the test Naomi I mean Ruth and Ora they both passed ain't going nowhere right here with you we going to follow you same as people today oh hallelujah praise in Jesus I ain't going nowhere I Love You Lord I'm right here I'm right here Lord come on I'm on my journey I decided to follow Jesus no turning back come on and then we little time go back if they're not seal it ain't the singing the song where could we go no where did they go both of them passed that test verse n the Lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them they lifted up their voice and wept they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people both of them on pass the test we ain't going nowhere but what happens she going to turn the heat up again the same thing in this Christian Journey when you don't overcome one thing the heat get turns up to see you going to still be able to take it right are you going to stay on your decision because the whole scope of Israel coming out of Egypt Moses told them God allowed you to go through these things to see whether you would be obedient or not God takes us through things just to see are we going to be obedient are we going to continue to still follow him against all of the things that going wrong they passed the test verse 11 Naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husband well she getting personal now right are you with me verse 12 turn them again my daughters go your way for I am too old to have a husband if I should say I have hope if I should have a husband also tonight and she also bear Sons would you te for them till they were grown Bo she really putting some heat on them would you stay for them from having husband but she really putting heed upon them nay my daughters for it grievously much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me they lifted up their voice and wept and Oprah kissed her mother-in-law but root clay unto her Oprah fell right think about it na put some heat on them same thing today she thought I'm too old would you wait for the boy would you same thing today start on your Christian Journey God dealing with you in a life of justification you get to a life of sanctification and then all of a sudden I want a man I want a husband and God say wait just wait let me finish dealing with you I'll give you one nah I got to I got to have a man I can see Oprah woo that's pretty hard man let's just say she was 30 man I'm 30 years old you're old if it was a possibility and I have to wait till at least 18 oh no no no I ain't marrying no baby I need a man man that's with a lot of young girls in this message they think they got to have a man I need a boyfriend I need a man I can't I can't wait I can't wait surely he ain't converted but when we get married he'll get converted no you get converted then God give you a husband that's converted pressure but Ruth said the Bible says she cleave Ruth had it in her mind man or no man will you die where you laid whoever your God will be my God hallelujah whether I even get married or not long as I got Jesus Christ that's my first husband I'm fine Ruth had a clear decision but today all my friends are getting married I'm going to be an old mother hover before I get married look at me come on that's nonsense that's nothing but the devil plag of your mind because what it is God oh God can't give you a husband God can't give you a wife yes he can that's right but he want you to marry him first you marry him first then he'll give you one patience Ruth went through all of this all of this are we together verse 14 note verse 15 what Ruth was actually doing when the Bible said she cled unto her Ruth was fulfilling Jude 13 behold when I gave you all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exalt you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saint Ruth was fulfilling that she was earnestly going to contend for it verse 15 says she said behold turn the heat on her again Ruth them pass them test but they going to bring the heat up again she said behold thy sister-in-law is gone back to her people and to her Gods return Thou after thy sister-in-law my goodness well what did Ruth do Ruth said in her entreat me not to leave thee or leave the message let me read that again and Ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or return from following after thee for where thou goest I will go and where thou lest I will LGE thy people shall be my people and thy God shall be my God cuz Ruth had that clearcut decision and we're going to let nothing stop her from going all of the way that's where it starts young people oh if you're here tonight you're not born again that's where it starts when you don't make that decision I don't care what happens to me I'm going to follow God I'm going to serve him and I'm going to stay on this journey until he fill me with his holy spirit AML it ain't going to let nothing shake me off she said your your sister-in-law went back to her people you hear all this noise this one left the message this one left the message what that got to do with me who leads the message my soul have no pleasure like Paul said and them that draw back but I got to keep moving I got to keep pressing on cuz I know where can I go these are the words of eternal life Whom Shall I go to there's nowhere else to go if God takes you from this message that mean he got something better for you to go but I'm here to tell you it ain't nothing better this is it God don't gave everything he don't gave us everythingall praise the Lord we're in the same time with Abraham and Isaac what did the Bible say Isaac the children that Abraham had by the concubines he gave him gifts but to Isaac he said he gave him all let them have the gifts but God don't giving me the all what is the all him him living inside of my soul that is the all few more minutes BR three more minutes we see here after that clear-cut decision the prophecy Des he had to have clear-cut decision I talk to people sometimes I know the decision is not clear having a Bible study with a woman she said people ask me so many questions she said I try to answer them best I can she that's why I come to your Bible studies to get answers I said sound wonderful that sound she said I want them to know God I want them to see God and so forth she said if there's a God I said whoa whoa she said huh I said did you hear what you just said woman I said you said if there's a God said yeah I said you ain't going to help nobody that's right I said you don't even know who he is yourself how you going to help somebody if there is a God if you don't have a clear understanding of what God has done in this day you go out there and trying to testify it going to hurt you that's why you need to know yourself study to show thyself approved to know where you're at when I preach to the young people I encourage them you come to a place in your life when you are challenged on what you believe you can take them to the word this is why I believe this not saying because my church preached this my pastor preached this this is why I do do this no you'll be able to go in the word yourself say this is why and that's the way it has to be not somebody ask you a question hold on a minute mommy somebody ask me something why do we wear dresses can you help me out mommy no you can go in the word yourself that's right say this is why cuz what my lord said verse four no turn with me to Ruth chapter 2 amen let's just now we see Ruth uh we ain't going to backtrack we'll just stay here we know the story how Ruth when they get back in Bethlehem Judea but said she wasn't welcome it wasn't oh no he said it wasn't that because they looked down on her cuz they knew who she was an idolatry he said that's why when God calls you he can put you amongst strangers people you don't know but he called you Ruth wasn't worried about the people she was going to meet she was stuck on her decision she wasn't worrying about who going to cross her life who not going to cross her life she was stuck on her decision and then we see now she want to go and glean she want to serve now she coming to the place serving see that goes to show you when God is really dealing with somebody hard they want to serve they want to do anything they can for the kingdom of God they just want to serve they didn't she didn't make Ruth she said that girl you get out there and you go get some bread no she didn't do that Ruth wanted to Ruth I want to know what can I do so different from the day you can't even get girls to watchh dishes when they even got a dishwasher you got to be one to serve Lord what can I do what can I do for the body of Christ what do you want me to do we're willing to do something for the kingdom of God praise the Lord always say this you got some boys well y'all ain't got no grass up here what do you do rake I don't know what you do rake rocks some places ain't got no grass what is it's rough up here man all I see is little Hedges and I don't see grass South Carolina we got grass lots of it I love it I come up here like what do y'all do some of you got grass I'm sure right well praise the Lord but isn't it beautiful when when I look in the economy of God how he can still in a desert place cause something to grow brother Bron said the only thing that a sticker is is something that has lack of water he that's why you get a tree even in this area with thorns put it in a place where there's a lot of water he said that thorn is just a leaf that withered up you put it in a bunch of water it'll unravel and be a leaf that was me that was you so if you sticky in your nature and just thick it that means you ain't been laying in water you ain't been laying in the word that's why you sticking poking now then wonder why nobody want to be around you don't blame it on nobody else you oh God you know what if you living a life you feel like nobody don't want to be around you don't want to shake your hand and you want to get in your little pity party nobody whoo is me nobody I want you to know you're the problem it's you you are the problem Ain got no friends you're the problem cuz according to the scripture he that has a friend PR first show himself friendly attitudes you know marriage life I'm sorry but marriage life today it could be very depressing if you didn't know there was hope that's right and what people let their lives and marriages do around this message and not paying no attention your children is watching you everything you do and sa they are looking at you they absorbing it and we think we can act any kind of way at home and it ain't affecting our children on the best preaching children get is watching their parents praise the Lord marriag is a wonderful thing isn't it me and my wife we have our ups and down but the way I put it I said me and my wife never argue we just have intense Fellowship sometimes right but we love each other the prophet said the best thing about breaking up is coming back together that's where the sweetness come right it's coming back together you begin to realize he said you begin to realize well maybe I wasn't so good at this time and you maybe maybe overreacted he said that's what bring things back together when you begin to realize I wasn't the best either and you forgave me amen because the marriage that we have whether you want to accept this or not friend it it reflects your relationship you yourself personally have with God it reflects it so what are we reflecting right husband love thy wife praise the Lord I don't switch the gear but it hits but let's let's just finish this cuz you really tightening there like oh but he going to go no you were doing so good brother see that's the problem we like Revelation right right oh we love to go we want to sore oh I'm an eagle I'm an eagle I'm an eagle I'm a sore but you got to remember Eagle can't sore always he got to come down sometime too that's true and that's where the problem is at right there we don't want to look and face reality that's true you know one thing I learned and made my marriage a blessing when I came to realize me and my wife is on different levels and because I see something way up in the word I can't assume she see it no I can't do that but what I've learned if I fellowship with her around the word not just in church where me and her can sit down Fellowship in the word together I'm bringing her where I'm at cuz I got a witness to my wife too she got the witness to me we got to help each other not just assuming she's seeing what I'm seeing no I can't do that when I learn there it brought peace cuz because I was seeing something so high and then she might do something I know I want to do I'm like really how could you do that cuz she wasn't seeing what I was seeing but now I can fellowship with her in the word and we's looking at the same thing praise the Lord my goodness I tell you marriage is just a wonderful thing amen a lot of young people don't want to get married because they see so many messed up marriages but the Bible said marriage is a good thing a wonderful thing amen praise the Lord so it's a wonderful thing brother and sisters there's no way brother Ron I could finish this just no way I really ain't even got to going it's just too much brother I'm sorry but Ruth serving it's it's Ruth deciding serving resting rewarding the prophet said we are now resting he said we are resting on the Promises of God and we'll be rewarded with a rapture that's why we supposed to rest on everything God has given us I mean look at Ruth life when Ruth was serving the Bible tells us I just just love this in Ruth 2:4 it said behold Boaz came from Bethlehem said unto the reaper the Lord be with you they answered him the Lord bless thee then said Boaz to his servant that was set over the Reapers whose damsel is this what we're reading is revelation 10:1 coming to Revelation 10:7 amen when Boaz come down it was many Reapers there but who did he go to head Reaper brother the brother minister is the head Reaper amen can we say amen amen he talked straight to the Head Reaper but what did he say who damel is this now the reaper is introducing Ruth to boas Hallelujah that's what this message come to do to introduce us to our Boaz can we say praise the lord it's laying right here brother the whole pattern is laying right here when I see this I get excited cuz that's me and then look at the scripture amen verse six and the servant that was set over the Reaper answer and said it is the moabit is damel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab verse 7even and she said I pray you let me glean and gather after the Reapers among the Sheep so she came had continued even from the morning until now that she tarried a little in the house then said Boaz to who see Revelation 10 R Ruth 47 he's talking to the reaper but Ruth 48 he talking to Ruth so now Revelation 10:7 Revelation 108 don't took the book The reer don't left the scene now he's talking directly to Ruth brother brownon don't left the scene but God is still talking directly to his bride cuz the introduction had took place Hallelujah notice verse eight he said Boaz then said Boaz unto Ruth here's thou not my daughter go not into another message cuz there are not one go not glean in another field go not get another Revelation go not following something contrary to this message neither go hence but abide here fast amen by my maidens that Bo is talking directly to Ruth that's why when I listen to these tapes when I listen to this message it's Christ talking directly to me cuz brother brandham was the mouthpiece the voice of God it was not his voice it's the voice of God that's why God in the message looking into the Unseen he said these is not the words of William Brand This is a vessel that has been yielded to me that I am using am and then brother B say I am the voice of God to you praise the Lord isn't it beautiful and when you look in the scripture Ruth 2:14 I just look and see how God don't place you in me Ruth 2114 says this Boaz said unto her at meal time which is evening time Come Thou hither eat of the bread dip thy morsel in vinegar she set beside who rapers don't you know that's uncommon for a woman to sit amongst Reapers what do that mean to you and me where God placed us the seven Church ages each messenger was a Reaper for their age is that right Paul didn't know he was the prophet of Ephesus Luther didn't know his position Wesley didn't know his position but what did God do with this message he put Ruth right in the meal time at the sit with the Reapers that's why God let you and I knows with each messenger was in each one of those ages he put us at the table at Meal Time look what he says here he says right here dip thy Morel in vinegar she sat beside the Reapers and he praise the Lord he reached her porch corn she did eat and was suffice and left so that's why we've been able to sit amongst each Reaper what Paul preached what irenius did what Martin did what Luther did what did the prophet did grab from each one of them and brought it to this day so you and I can see everything that's where he placed this Bri at me time amen that's why we see it all God had revealed everything to us but all of everything Ruth went to and I just have to close what I read to you in uh chapter 4 when all those women let her be like Leah let her be like Rachel all of the one they were despising her but now look they giving praise out of their mouth cuz now they realize this is now not just Ruth it's Miss Boaz Hallelujah the prophet said I'm no longer going to call you church he said I'll call you bride so that you'll understand are you with me friends Ruth's position placed back in the body couldn't been stopped because of illegitimacy right cuz you and I all come out of a perverted birth but that ain't going to stop predestination what God has planned for you and me the perverted verse don't stop it amen so be like well you know I born in such and such family and this this and this family this that ain't got nothing to do with you amen I have a new father I took on a new nature you see what we messed up at you trying to conjure up some old Spirits or something when you try to justify some of your attitude well we like this cuz that's the way my family was you keep confessing that you'll stay like that right I'm so thankful when we are born again we break family traits right we break family strands I'm a witness of that that I broke my family strand because I got a new father new nature and I can live higher than this praise the Lord yeah there are certain characteristics we have but certain things friend with temperaments and attitudes and stuff we can't keep justifying that cuz that's how we was raised CU we supposed to be represent represent another kingdom that's what we supposed to be representing good can we say praise the lord lord the Lord there's no way brother Ron they say the worst death is to be dragged to death and I'm not going to drag you to death maybe we can finish another time this just a series we went on for a while at my church just looking at all the things in Ruth when it come to the end of the day I see me amen when Ruth when she we just when Ruth chapter 4 when she was talking to Boaz we just see the patterns Boaz told her everybody know you're a virtuous woman you don't run off of old man or young you virous SI of her testimony people begin to see that oh more bite out of rship but she seeing a character he fell in love with her so much he said I'll go play the part I'll do what you supposed to do so when Boaz went up there and saido such a one what we see now we stepped into Revelation chapter 5 when John was calling for a redeemer who is worthy to open the book we see the same pth that's why he went to a gate and that's why there was Elders there that's why in Revelation 5 you see Elders there God is showing us a whole preview of everything sitting right there are you with me but you remember Naomi testified I can't have children even if I did would you wait she was admitting I'm dried up right and the Beautiful Thing when Boaz and Ruth came into that perfect union and when they had that child who do they pass the child to Naomi so her being already dried up and so forth I believe with all of my heart when they put that baby in her arms something happened here in na armi restoration amen something happened in her body had come alive to nurse this baby cuz brother brownon said Naomi tight Israel can these Dry Bones live so when that baby fell in Naomi's arm she was no longer dry God had to do something so she could you nurse that baby and that's the same type with this message when we Rapture out of here the baby is the message when we Rapture out the same message goes to Revelation one and when Revelation one goes to the 144,000 and when they preach when they prophesy this message them dry bones don't to come alive Israel going to come alive now we can see Israel going to come alive with the same message that we got where are we to be right now not dead alive willing to testify through a life to show people look what this message done for me it changed me make me what I am today that's why nobody can talk me out of there cuz I know what it did for Bley Willams Ruth was so eliminated when she went to bo bo said who are thou she said I'm Ruth then after Bo gave her all of the promises what he going to do she went back home to her mama her mama Naomi said who ought th my daugh and the Bible said Ruth said she just told him what Bo ass said she didn't say I'm Ruth no when she be SP back to her mama she told him everything the man was going to do cuz now she ain't identifying herself as Ruth she identifying herself as boas so all I can tell you what is this message all I can tell you what it done for me all I can tell you what it's doing for me me and Christ we are one that's what it brought me to that's all I can justify that's all I can do sir this is real amen all of these types and shadows God laid the par so you and I can look back and see where we are at thank you Lord praise the Lord can we give the Lord a hand let us pray amen he father we just thank you tonight we just thank you for your word Lord maybe a little chopped up here and there but it's all for your glory yes all for your grace for what you've done for us just showing the patterns how that we are Ruth just a type see where we supposed to be in this day and hour I can't say it too many times of her life come from the worst of the worst of the worst but it did not stop what you have predestinated for her so the things are today dear God but God what you have for me it is for me and no one can take that away from me amen so Lord we just leave everything into theiry hands your people myself we commit all self to you and we give you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray the church says amen amen God bless you bless you [Music] brother just walking through the scriptures and God Opening Our Eyes of understanding and come to the Head Reaper [Music] introduces Boaz you see the types and shadows all through there just huh yeah that's what I love when Ministries come in each one of them have

through the scriptures right here I saw the first second pole why don't you stay here now as the Lord God liveing as you live with thy people my people why don't you return go back n n n Peter why don't you go also where could we go you see all the scriptures everything tying together oh oh my how there's the mystery of God how much of it is located throughout all of the different chapters and verses if we just unlock it with the key of faith and then before your wondering eyes there he is that's him that's my Kinsman that's my Boaz that's who I fell in love with amen oh yeah we heard a prophet in this day his name is William brandham and I'm not ashamed to that that's right but I'll tell you I heard the voice behind the voice I heard my boy that's who I fell in love [Music] with Amen brother Burley you did a just a tremendous job there see how how time goes by so quick when you're just in the word you're enjoying [Music] it amen amen one of these days it's going to be like Enoch yes sir yes sir this Revelation that you is just all of a sudden bursting before you just coming and coming until all of a sudden brother Ram said he stepped into that Revelation he stepped into it yes sir I believe saints of God that this revelation of Jesus Christ is becoming so unveiled that we're stepping into it realizing that's our position that's right remember he saw the vision of the bride and part of it was getting out of step that's right get back in step back that's right I believe the holy spirit is telling some that are just getting out of get back back in Step oh I just so enjoyed it tonight I'm not going to try to repr preach or anything like that because I tell you there was enough in there you could go back and listen this two or three times that's why sometimes I
