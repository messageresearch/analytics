[12:48] that have been turned in today that we'd
[12:51] like to to present to you. But before we
[12:53] do, I'd like to sing the first verse in
[12:55] the chorus to claim the blood. The blood
[12:58] of Jesus Christ is still an inoculation
[13:01] that can cleanse you from sin. It can
[13:03] heal you this morning. What's your need?
[13:07] Just give it to him and apply the blood.
[13:10] Amen. First verse this morning.
[13:12] I have a source
[13:17] of strength when I am weak
[13:24] that takes me through.
[13:29] When life is pressing me,
[13:35] I have the source
[13:39] of power from above.
[13:46] I got word over
[13:51] by the shield of blood.
[13:57] I claim the blood

[14:18] for all my sin

[14:41] sing the second verse, first of
[14:44] Thanksgiving praise report this morning
[14:46] from Sister Carolyn Bolair's. Sister
[14:48] Caroline says, "I want to give thanks
[14:49] and praise to my Lord and Savior Jesus
[14:51] Christ for bringing me through both my
[14:53] of my surgeries and through my

[16:28] to pray about this morning. It says,
[16:30] "Saints, I've heard I have a heavy heart
[16:32] for a very special friend of mine and
[16:34] their family. U her name is Sister
[16:37] Shauna Petty and she's from Tennessee.

[16:42] close. She was she's going in for some
[16:44] testing. Has now been notified of a
[16:46] tumor.
[16:48] They're doing some additional tests to
[16:50] see what else the tumor has spread to,
[16:52] but the prognosis doesn't seem good by
[16:55] man's standards. However, we know with
[16:57] God all things are possible. I'm asking
[16:59] the saints of God to intercede on Shauna
[17:02] Perry's behalf. May God bless you all.
[17:04] So, let's remember this friend of
[17:06] brother George. He asked us to remember
[17:07] them in prayer this morning.
[17:09] Brother Paul Maple says, "I have a my
[17:11] coworker has asked prayer for his
[17:14] 30-year-old brother who was diagnosed
[17:16] with leukemia cancer right before
[17:18] Thanksgiving. Please keep him and his
[17:20] family in prayer. So, let's remember

[17:39] she's hopefully could step down to
[17:41] rehabilitation care. So, let's remember
[17:43] brother Ezra's mom. Maybe the Lord will
[17:45] touch her. Do you have a need today?
[17:48] Can you claim the blood of Jesus Christ
[17:50] for your need? I'm thankful for the
[17:52] blood this morning. I'm thankful that
[17:54] it's still on the throne and it covers
[17:56] our sins and our shortcomings and our
[17:58] iniquities. What a wonderful savior we
[18:01] have that laid his life down that we can
[18:03] have him and be partakers with him this
[18:06] morning. Second verse and then we'll

[18:09] the needs this morning. I do not know. I
[18:13] do not know
[18:17] how others make it through.
[18:24] would never go
[18:29] to count three as I do.
[18:35] For there's a healing
[18:40] cleansing
[18:42] stream which flows
[18:46] with peace that only
[18:51] is redeemed. You got a need, lift your

[37:53] &gt;&gt; No,
[38:00] he didn't ask me if I wanted to sing it
[38:02] with the singers or the musicians, but
[38:05] this is the way I'd practice it. But if
[38:07] you can't get it, brother, we'll go the
[38:09] other route.

[43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. and I greet you all this morning
[43:51] in the lovely name of Jesus Christ.
[43:54] Amen. It's good to see so many out to
[43:56] the house of the Lord today. Uh give you
[43:59] a testimony, just a short testimony.
[44:01] Yesterday evening, I had to run over to
[44:04] the Arrowhead Mall to to get something.
[44:07] It was about 7:15 at night. I got out. I
[44:10] went into the mall, got what I needed,
[44:12] and came back. And I lost my wallet and
[44:15] I lost it in the parking lot.
[44:18] And when I got home, you know, it's
[44:20] about a half hour, 40-minute drive home.
[44:23] By the time I got home, I realized, oh,
[44:25] my wallet. And I realized there's only
[44:28] one place that would have been in the
[44:29] parking lot there at Arrowhead Mall. So,
[44:32] I said, Sandy, um, would you pray with
[44:35] me? I said, uh, you know, if any of you
[44:38] ever ever lost your wallet, it's just
[44:41] that, oh my, what do I do? How do I
[44:43] cancel? What do I cancel? All of that
[44:45] stuff
[44:46] &gt;&gt; and everything. So Sandy and I, we
[44:48] prayed and everything. Then I called
[44:49] Amos on the way there and I said, "Amos,
[44:52] pray with me and everything and I'm
[44:54] talking to him the whole time." Uh, he
[44:56] said, "Well, Dad, I you know, I'm closer
[44:58] to the mall." I said, "You don't know
[45:00] where it's at and everything." I said,
[45:01] "Well, just stay on the the phone with
[45:04] me." And I said, "Uh, I knew exactly
[45:06] where I parked and everything." Anyway,
[45:07] long story short, I pull up into the
[45:09] parking lot and there it is untouched
[45:12] and people walking around and and
[45:14] everything and I and it was opened up
[45:17] and everything. I thought, well, maybe
[45:19] the cards are gone or whatever, but it
[45:21] was all there. And I that's a miracle. I
[45:23] don't know if
[45:27] And so I thank God
[45:30] I thank God that uh that he had an angel
[45:33] standing over that. Not that it's that
[45:35] big of a thing, but you know, it can be
[45:37] a big thing. Anyway, uh so I'm so
[45:40] thankful uh for that. And tomorrow
[45:43] morning, for those of you that know,
[45:45] I'll be going in for heart surgery. Um I
[45:48] leave my house about 4:30 in the
[45:50] morning, go towards Scottsdale, be there
[45:52] at 5:30, check in. Procedures scheduled
[45:55] at 7:30. They're they're going to do
[45:58] what they call the taver, a transaortic
[46:01] valve replacement where they go through
[46:03] the aorta, come up, go into the heart.
[46:06] This is without open heart. It's not
[46:08] opening the chest. And so they come in
[46:10] there and they take this thing and they
[46:13] go through the aortic valve and they
[46:15] leave uh they open it up like a stint
[46:18] and then they leave the new valve. I
[46:20] said, "What do you do with the old one?"
[46:22] Well, we just plaster it to the wall of
[46:25] your heart and uh and and you're good to
[46:28] go. I said, "Well," he says, "Well,
[46:30] it'll take about 20 minutes and u then
[46:34] you're done with the procedure. Then you
[46:36] go into recovery and uh we keep you
[46:39] overnight uh just to observe you and uh
[46:42] you're you go home the next day." They
[46:44] said it'd be about two weeks for you to,
[46:47] you know, said you'll feel good. you'll
[46:49] feel more blood and and stuff. Uh but
[46:52] said, "But your body's not conditioned
[46:56] uh to, you know, go out there." Said,
[46:58] "Don't so kind of take it easy for the
[47:00] next little bit." So, um you'll be
[47:02] praying for us tomorrow morning, 7:30.
[47:04] Ask the Lord to just um have his way.
[47:08] And so,
[47:10] um also too, we have uh brother Freddy
[47:14] Massi is here with us. Brother Freddy is
[47:17] a pastor from Congo. Would you come up

[47:24] the people here. Uh, can you translate

[47:57] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; I want to greet you in the name of the
[48:08] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[48:12] Okay,

[48:22] Phoenix
[48:27] that I'm here with.
[48:35] It's my joy to be back here among you.
[48:47] I bring you greetings from the people of
[48:49] God over there in Lubashi.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; There's a people on the other side, your
[49:00] brothers and sisters.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; They believe the same message.
[49:08] prophet.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; They believe the same prophet
[49:13] &gt;&gt; and they believe to the same word.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; It's just a matter of countries and
[49:23] distances.
[49:27] But one of these days
[49:32] &gt;&gt; we will be together somewhere where
[49:35] there will be no distances.
[49:41] And we won't need visas
[49:45] to travel
[49:49] &gt;&gt; and they will be there together.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; We won't even need interpreters.
[50:04] Brother say that God has g us a language
[50:07] that will allow us to communicate.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; But it's my joy to be here this morning
[50:16] &gt;&gt; among you.
[50:24] Some of my believers when they come over
[50:27] here they attend this church of right.
[50:34] I also have my daughter here and his uh
[50:37] husband.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Ask them to stand up. Uh last time asked
[50:48] me so the people knows them.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. say
[50:56] &gt;&gt; okay
[51:00] that's sister Rebecca and
[51:04] &gt;&gt; okay
[51:12] &gt;&gt; I always love my brother Ron
[51:17] May the Lord richly bless you
[51:22] I'm happy to be here with you this
[51:23] morning.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; I love you.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; And in the name of the Lord Jesus
[51:41] greetings.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; I will give
[51:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you, Joshua. Amen.
[51:52] Well, it's a a privilege to have brother
[51:54] George Smith with us today. And I had
[51:58] several of the saints here from the
[52:00] church has said, um, brother Ron, if you
[52:03] could just ask brother George perhaps he
[52:06] could give his testimony, his life
[52:09] story. And uh uh I had asked Brother
[52:13] George, I said, I've had bits and pieces
[52:15] of it here and there, but I said, "Feel
[52:18] free to, you know, we're at home. We're
[52:20] family. We'd love to to hear that." And
[52:22] so he can have a little preachimony. He
[52:25] can preach a little bit and have a
[52:26] testimony, mix it together. So, um, but
[52:30] first met Brother George 1973
[52:33] at Spoken Word, uh, publications there
[52:36] and, uh, we were just, uh, me and my
[52:40] twin brother and brother Mitch and and
[52:42] brother Tom Weathers. Anyway, long story
[52:45] short, we were there and we met Brother
[52:48] George and and uh, he said, "What are
[52:50] you boys doing?" We said, "Well, we're
[52:51] just hanging out." And he said, "Well,
[52:53] come with me." They put us to to work
[52:55] and and we went over to the tabernacle
[52:59] and to Brandham Tabernacle and we were
[53:01] taking chairs and getting ready for some
[53:03] big meetings.
[53:06] Little short fella there with some
[53:07] glasses, kind of an older fella and
[53:10] everything. He said, "Do you all know
[53:11] who this is?" And I said, "No, I I
[53:13] don't." And it was brother Doc Brandham,
[53:15] Brother Brandham's brother. So, uh, our
[53:18] first introduction, uh, there was with
[53:21] brother George back there in 1973. And I
[53:25] want to say we've become good friends.
[53:28] And I want to say I appreciate him. He's
[53:29] one of the few uh, of whether it be the
[53:33] family or some of the older icons that
[53:36] is still alive and that has got a very
[53:40] balanced testimony. I've always
[53:42] appreciate that about you, brother
[53:44] George. he's helped to translate into
[53:46] the Spanish language. Many people around
[53:49] the world are beneficiaries of his
[53:52] having translated this message um into
[53:55] Spanish. And so without any further ado,
[53:58] let's all stand together. Let's sing
[54:00] Only Believe. Only believe. And our
[54:03] brother George, I'd ask him to just take
[54:05] his liberty and however he feels this
[54:08] morning, may it bless your hearts. Yes.
[54:12] Lonely
[54:14] me
[54:24] for all
[54:26] thank you
[54:30] only
[54:33] beyond.
[54:42] Only
[54:48] all things are possible.
[54:54] Yes. only
[54:56] believe
[54:59] and Lord
[55:02] I
[55:05] Yes Lord
[55:08] I believe
[55:12] all things are possible
[55:18] Lord I
[55:20] believe
[55:23] oh Lord Lord
[55:26] I need
[55:29] Lord
[55:31] I believe
[55:35] all things are possible
[55:41] Lord I
[55:46] &gt;&gt; let us pray. Heavenly Father we thank
[55:48] you for your mercy to us today. We thank
[55:50] you Lord that you brought each one of us
[55:52] from different places and here we are
[55:55] gathered together in the house of prayer
[55:57] and Lord it's good to be amongst
[55:59] believers.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; It's good to be amongst people that
[56:02] believe the word as your prophet brought
[56:04] it.
[56:06] And Lord here we are to go down memory
[56:09] lane one more time to recall your grace
[56:12] to me. I pray that you'd bless these
[56:14] words. May they be a blessing to
[56:16] everyone and may we go out of here
[56:19] better than we came in.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Help us now in Jesus name. Amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; While you're standing, let's turn in the
[56:26] book of Acts, chapter 1.
[56:31] Acts, chapter 1. This is the
[56:35] This is the early church. This is the
[56:36] way it's supposed to work,
[56:39] you know, but we've got a lot of
[56:41] branches since then. But in the
[56:43] beginning, it says here in verse six,
[56:46] when they therefore were come together,
[56:48] they asked of him, that's the Lord
[56:50] Jesus, saying, Lord, will you at this
[56:53] time restore
[56:55] again the kingdom to Israel? In other
[56:58] words, will you get the Romans offer
[56:59] back? Let us enjoy the greatness of God.
[57:04] And he said, "It's not for you all to
[57:06] know the times or the seasons which the
[57:08] Father hath put in his own power,
[57:11] but ye shall receive power after that
[57:14] the Holy Ghost has come upon you. And
[57:17] you shall be witnesses unto me these
[57:20] three and a half years you've been with
[57:21] me. You're going to be a witness of
[57:23] these things right here in Jerusalem
[57:26] over in Judea, Samaria, and to the
[57:29] uttermost last part of the earth, even
[57:31] to Phoenix, Arizona.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; The gospel didn't come in a parachute.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Some Catholic priests brought it over
[57:39] here a long time ago, and now we've been
[57:42] restored back to the full word.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[57:49] So, as you've seen already, God is a God
[57:52] of variety,
[57:54] &gt;&gt; and I don't have all the answers. So,
[57:58] don't be asking questions. You ask your
[57:59] pastor the questions.
[58:02] But, um, we're glad to be here, glad to
[58:04] be in fellowship, and to be with Brother
[58:08] Ron and all of you. Many of you come
[58:10] from a long ways away. It's always
[58:13] uh a blessing to look out there and see
[58:15] some people I know. I've been a lot of
[58:17] places where I didn't know anybody,
[58:19] &gt;&gt; but uh I know some of you
[58:22] and being one of the last eyewitnesses
[58:25] of this great ministry. It's a great
[58:27] responsibility.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Uh we've got good preachers, so I don't
[58:31] need to do that. But nobody has my
[58:33] story.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; And when we get to the other side and
[58:36] we're not wearing any watches or cell
[58:38] phones, thank you.
[58:40] I'll sit and listen to your stories
[58:43] &gt;&gt; one at a time because we all have a
[58:47] story to tell.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Now, I was the eagle that was born in
[58:51] the Baptist chickenard.
[58:53] Some of you came from Mormon. You came
[58:54] from Catholic. Came from all kinds of
[58:56] stuff.
[58:58] And we're glad that God has revealed
[59:00] himself and we're right here in the
[59:02] word. But see, we don't have the the
[59:05] right or the privilege
[59:08] &gt;&gt; to throw rocks at the chicken yard.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; There's still eagles out there.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Just live your salty Christian life
[59:16] &gt;&gt; and that will attract others.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Real simple. So, I've got a long story,
[59:22] but we'll try to cut it down to
[59:24] Well, we're not going to tell you how
[59:25] much.
[59:27] Um, I have a lot of history here in
[59:30] Arizona. Uh my parents were they met in
[59:35] Los Angeles at the Bible school over
[59:37] there. They were married in 1944
[59:40] and my mother was from Tucson. My father
[59:42] was from Kansas City, Missouri. They
[59:44] were both Americans for those who you
[59:47] think that something different. No. My
[59:50] grandfather came from New England, from
[59:52] Vermont. His father came from England
[59:55] and he looked just like me.
[59:58] So they graduated from Bible school and
[1:00:03] they immediately thought that the, you
[1:00:05] know, the Lord's will for them would be
[1:00:07] to go to Mexico and find this tribe that
[1:00:12] didn't have any written language and
[1:00:14] start working on the Bible. Now, see,
[1:00:17] that sounds real, real great. But first
[1:00:20] of all, there's no GPS. Okay? They they
[1:00:23] had an idea of where these people lived.
[1:00:26] And so they had an old army truck that
[1:00:27] they were driving and they drove that as
[1:00:29] far as they'd go and then they got on
[1:00:31] horseback, drove four days up in the
[1:00:33] mountains. These are newlyweds that
[1:00:35] barely know any maybe two words of
[1:00:37] Spanish.
[1:00:40] And the desire to translate the Bible is
[1:00:42] very very important because you might
[1:00:45] not know these facts, but in our world
[1:00:48] today there's 7,000 known languages.
[1:00:53] Only a few speak English. Okay. And the
[1:00:57] Bible has been translated into 750
[1:01:00] languages and the New Testament is
[1:01:03] available in almost 1,600.
[1:01:05] So the word is getting out there. But um
[1:01:09] this is a long process. This isn't
[1:01:12] something with no computer.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; I mean when when Scoffield did his work
[1:01:16] over here in the Bible, there was no
[1:01:18] computers.
[1:01:19] He finished his work on January 1st,
[1:01:22] 1909
[1:01:24] with no computer, pencil and paper. And
[1:01:26] that's what we have today. And a lot of
[1:01:28] this is very, very good. Well, anyway,
[1:01:31] um so they're up here in the mountains
[1:01:33] of Chihuahua, and they um they got to
[1:01:37] find these people. you know, they all
[1:01:39] look the same. So, they got to find the
[1:01:40] people that speak this other language
[1:01:43] and then try to talk to them and try to
[1:01:46] get some confidence going. And first
[1:01:50] thing you got to do is make a
[1:01:51] dictionary.
[1:01:53] Imagine nothing written down, only lip
[1:01:56] to ear. And so once you have a
[1:01:59] dictionary, well, then you got to teach
[1:02:01] these people to read.
[1:02:04] And then you get into St. John. And by
[1:02:07] then you might have been there 25 years.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm an eyewitness that my dad
[1:02:12] didn't have that kind of patience.
[1:02:15] A lot of good ideas, but no. And so he
[1:02:19] um eventually left that work for someone
[1:02:22] else. It did get done
[1:02:24] and they um he moved over to the close
[1:02:27] to the east coast of Mexico
[1:02:30] on the you know the Gulf of America over
[1:02:32] there. And so, um,
[1:02:36] but while while they're in the
[1:02:37] mountains, now forgive me if I kind of
[1:02:40] backtracked a little bit, but
[1:02:43] Holy Ghost will work it out
[1:02:45] in the mountains, uh, being a new
[1:02:48] family. Well, there's going to be a baby
[1:02:50] born. Well, they out of the mountains
[1:02:52] instead of going to Arizona where
[1:02:53] grandma lives. No, they got on the
[1:02:55] train, went to Mexico City, where was
[1:02:58] the headquarters of the Wikliff Bible
[1:03:00] translators
[1:03:01] and that's where their first child was
[1:03:03] born in late August 1945.
[1:03:07] That was me. Okay, that's why in my big
[1:03:10] family I'm always number one. But um the
[1:03:14] um the fact is that they come back to
[1:03:17] the mountains, stayed a while. We got
[1:03:19] pictures to prove it. But anyway, now
[1:03:21] we're living on the east coast of
[1:03:22] Mexico. And uh I think I was in the it
[1:03:26] was either the first or the second
[1:03:27] grade. And so here I am the only white
[1:03:30] kid in school and all these Mexican
[1:03:32] kids. It's only like I don't know 200
[1:03:34] miles below the border. But apparently
[1:03:36] they didn't have much experience with my
[1:03:38] type of people. So one day when I wasn't
[1:03:41] paying attention, a little friend of
[1:03:43] mine
[1:03:45] got a real sharp point on his pencil.
[1:03:47] And back then we didn't have pencil
[1:03:49] sharpeners. This is the stone age, you
[1:03:50] know, didn't have the
[1:03:53] Everybody carried a single-edge razor
[1:03:55] blade. Yeah. In their book. Very safe.
[1:03:58] No foolishness. And so when they needed
[1:04:01] a pencil, sharpen the pencil, you know.
[1:04:04] And so while I wasn't looking, he jabbed
[1:04:06] me in the arm. And then when he saw I
[1:04:08] had red blood like him, then we could be
[1:04:10] friends. Yeah. That's my first battle
[1:04:13] scar. And so we um they put me through
[1:04:18] the the sixth grade in Spanish. And at
[1:04:21] home, my mother was teaching us, you
[1:04:22] know, reading and what we needed to know
[1:04:24] for English.
[1:04:26] But she had a very strict rules.
[1:04:30] And so everything got tried out on
[1:04:32] number one and then, you know,
[1:04:35] went down to the others. And so one of
[1:04:38] the rules was you speak English in the
[1:04:41] house and you speak Spanish outside the
[1:04:43] house. Fine. That's your rule. And um so
[1:04:47] she, you know, brought us up that way.
[1:04:49] Even when when a a another American
[1:04:52] missionary would come along who spoke
[1:04:54] perfect Spanish. No, that's the kind of
[1:04:57] pig you speak English to. Little kids
[1:04:59] know these things. I've got a I had a
[1:05:01] friend back where I live.
[1:05:04] This lady owned a Chinese restaurant and
[1:05:06] she she had this little child three
[1:05:08] years old and this child already knew
[1:05:10] how to speak English and two kinds of
[1:05:12] Chinese and who to speak it to. So
[1:05:15] little kids can do a lot of things.
[1:05:18] But um my mother also taught us early on
[1:05:22] you read your Bible and pray. So when I
[1:05:25] hear William Brandon saying this years
[1:05:27] later, well I'd already been doing that.
[1:05:28] You know, it wasn't new. And so here I
[1:05:32] was, you know, the missionar's child. We
[1:05:34] got to be sit on the front row. Nobody
[1:05:36] asked us back then, do you want to go to
[1:05:37] church tonight?
[1:05:40] No. What would you like for supper? I
[1:05:42] never heard that kind of stuff. You
[1:05:43] know,
[1:05:46] you just sit down and be quiet. Uh it
[1:05:48] was a different world. So um so I'm
[1:05:52] hearing the gospel at least three times
[1:05:54] a week, you know, and it's all in
[1:05:56] Spanish. And so God was preparing
[1:06:00] something. he was getting something
[1:06:01] ready for later. And uh and so when I
[1:06:05] was uh 9 years old,
[1:06:08] I had what we'll call a close encounter
[1:06:10] with Jesus Christ because the obviously
[1:06:12] the gospel is for me too. Not just for
[1:06:14] all them, it's for me too.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; You know, because the Bible says in
[1:06:17] Romans uh 3:23, all have sinned.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; That's all the Smiths, the Brandoms, the
[1:06:24] Petersons, all of them.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; All sin.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Keeps them. They they can't get to the
[1:06:29] glory of God.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; But God made a way.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; He sent us Paul. And Paul wrote in here,
[1:06:36] "Those that call upon the name of the
[1:06:38] Lord
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; shall be saved."
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; So here I was 9 years old and was
[1:06:44] baptized in the Baptist church uh in the
[1:06:48] titles like a lot of you, you know, we
[1:06:50] all didn't we all weren't born angels.
[1:06:52] No.
[1:06:54] And so that was Easter of 1955.
[1:06:57] And we're going to get to good start,
[1:07:00] good part here in a minute. So don't
[1:07:01] don't go to sleep yet.
[1:07:03] Um, so by the time I get out of the
[1:07:06] sixth grade, I um I was 12 years old and
[1:07:12] my parents decided that
[1:07:15] live with somebody else in Texas for the
[1:07:17] other six years, you know, get get a
[1:07:20] balance. And that's why I carry this
[1:07:22] level here. to remind you of balance.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Not just what you eat or what you give
[1:07:28] your dog. Everything in your waking
[1:07:31] hours has to do with balance.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Okay? And so I celebrate my 13th
[1:07:36] birthday in Houston, Texas with people I
[1:07:38] didn't know.
[1:07:40] But um life goes on and then uh we lived
[1:07:43] in Texas. who lived in different places
[1:07:45] and and so in January of ' 62 I had a
[1:07:49] closer encounter and I was you know a
[1:07:51] little older and um uh they sent me to
[1:07:55] live with my grandfather in Tucson,
[1:07:56] Arizona. My mother was born in Tucson.
[1:07:59] She died in Tucson. So it's a home in a
[1:08:03] lot of ways.
[1:08:05] So, here we are in the uh large school
[1:08:08] in Tucson, probably 200 kids.
[1:08:13] And I was the guy that didn't go to the
[1:08:15] parties. I didn't smoke. I didn't drink.
[1:08:18] And um and so my fellowship in school,
[1:08:21] you know, at lunchtime was with these
[1:08:23] Mormon kids that, you know, they had a
[1:08:26] prophet. Of course, I didn't know about
[1:08:27] the prophet back then, but at least they
[1:08:29] they had a a a little bit of foundation
[1:08:32] in the word. till we get to their other
[1:08:34] book and then they go that way and I say
[1:08:36] with the word, you know. But anyway, um
[1:08:40] so this was um probably 10th grade.
[1:08:42] Yeah. When I got to Tucson and I was the
[1:08:45] guy with a reputation and so finally um
[1:08:50] one day this girl comes up to me and and
[1:08:52] I barely knew her and she said, "You
[1:08:54] know, we know that you're so picky, but
[1:08:56] I don't know just the girl for you." Oh,
[1:08:59] thank you. Where is she? Way over there
[1:09:01] getting on the bus. So the next day I
[1:09:04] met Rebecca Brandham. I was raised in
[1:09:08] the Baptist church. We never heard that
[1:09:10] name before. I knew a lot of preachers,
[1:09:12] but we didn't know the name Brandham.
[1:09:14] And so um sure enough, most beautiful
[1:09:17] girl I'd ever seen. And uh so they
[1:09:20] introduced us. And so the next thing was
[1:09:23] she said, "Well, you got to talk to my
[1:09:24] dad." Fine. And all she said, "My dad's
[1:09:26] a preacher." She didn't give me no long
[1:09:29] story. And I wasn't scared of any
[1:09:32] preachers, you know, it wasn't a
[1:09:33] problem. And um so the miracle is God
[1:09:37] moved these people from Indiana to
[1:09:39] Arizona, 1,800 miles away, and he put
[1:09:42] them a block and a half from my house. I
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; mean, it's right there, you know. God
[1:09:47] knows how to do things.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; And so, um trying to follow these notes
[1:09:53] so we can at least keep it some kind of
[1:09:55] order. Um, so anyway, I go to meet him
[1:09:58] and she introduces me and then she
[1:10:01] disappeared and here I am with this
[1:10:04] preacher, no shirt on,
[1:10:07] he's working with the bushes in the
[1:10:08] backyard.
[1:10:10] And so we talked a little bit, you know,
[1:10:12] I don't I didn't record it, but by that
[1:10:16] time, you know, here I was 17 years old
[1:10:19] and I'd already read my Bible all the
[1:10:21] way through twice. Yeah. all those
[1:10:23] genealogies and all. Yeah. That's part
[1:10:25] of God's word.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; And on your little cell phone, there's a
[1:10:29] schedule.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; If you start today,
[1:10:32] by this time next year, you've read the
[1:10:34] whole Bible.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; It works.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; And your prophet said back to the word
[1:10:38] over 200 times.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; so, uh, we'll try just to stick with the
[1:10:42] testimony here.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Um, so any I'd read my Bible all the way
[1:10:45] through. So I I kind of knew the spirit
[1:10:47] of the word, you know, you know, like
[1:10:49] brother Ram said when he read um Tarzan,
[1:10:53] he wanted to live in the tree with the
[1:10:54] skin and you know, because it's the
[1:10:56] spirit of what you read.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; You see, five years from today, you're
[1:11:00] going to be the very same person.
[1:11:03] The only thing different will be the
[1:11:04] books you read and the people you meet.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; So anyway, talking with him a few
[1:11:11] minutes, I could see, okay, there's
[1:11:13] something different here. This man's
[1:11:15] living the spirit of the scripture. He's
[1:11:18] not trying to impress me with his new
[1:11:19] car or nothing. Just he's just a a very
[1:11:23] humble person. Uh there's no put on just
[1:11:28] what you see.
[1:11:30] So after we talk a few minutes, he gives
[1:11:32] me permission to date his daughter.
[1:11:35] Okay, that was the whole objective. So I
[1:11:37] had the victory.
[1:11:40] Amen. But he had the problem
[1:11:44] because of some other guys. They were
[1:11:46] kind of waiting their turn. She just
[1:11:47] barely turned 17 and and they were kind
[1:11:50] of waiting. But then he had to announce
[1:11:53] to people she had a boyfriend. Game's
[1:11:55] over.
[1:11:57] So um
[1:12:00] uh when he tells the story it, you know,
[1:12:03] his version is similar to mine, but um
[1:12:06] the fact is that when I was when we
[1:12:10] started dating, we're in school
[1:12:11] together, lived down the street, same
[1:12:13] bus a lot of times. And um
[1:12:17] so when they moved from Indiana, it was
[1:12:20] by vision. It wasn't by vote to the
[1:12:22] church or let's go for the weather. No,
[1:12:24] there was a vision. and you know the
[1:12:25] whole story. And so they move out there.
[1:12:28] Um this is in the middle of the 11th
[1:12:30] grade for Rebecca. Now she had been with
[1:12:32] these same people since kindergarten.
[1:12:34] Same neighbors. So this was a little
[1:12:36] bit, you know, unsettling for a young
[1:12:38] lady. And um so they didn't bring any
[1:12:41] furniture. They just brought their
[1:12:42] clothes. They don't know how long
[1:12:43] they're going to stay. Vision said go
[1:12:45] west. So here they are out west. And
[1:12:48] there's no church. There's no uh
[1:12:50] friends. There's no trees. there's no
[1:12:54] piano
[1:12:55] because every day she's she had a a
[1:12:57] small spin at piano, you know, about the
[1:12:59] size of that organ. And that's where she
[1:13:01] would practice every day because she had
[1:13:02] already been in in piano lessons for
[1:13:05] eight or 10 years in classical music.
[1:13:07] So, she'd play and Brother Brand really
[1:13:10] enjoyed a lot of the things she was
[1:13:11] playing. Well, anyway, they get out west
[1:13:14] and we don't have these things. Well,
[1:13:17] uh, the girl on the corner was, you
[1:13:20] know, became friends and her mother was
[1:13:22] a piano teacher and she had a grand
[1:13:25] piano, you know, 10 foot. And so that's
[1:13:27] where Rebecca was in her spare time. And
[1:13:30] um, and so one day, Brother Ram's
[1:13:33] getting the family together. We're going
[1:13:34] to go to supper. And there's only two
[1:13:37] kids in the back seat. Where's Rebecca?
[1:13:39] Well, she's not the corner. We'll pick
[1:13:40] her up on the way. So he goes to the
[1:13:42] corner. When he gets out of the car, he
[1:13:44] could hear the piano playing because
[1:13:46] there's two girls. That's 20 fingers on
[1:13:49] 88 keys. And they're making a lot of
[1:13:52] noise. And it's not down at the cross.
[1:13:54] It's not Shopan or Beethoven, nothing
[1:13:56] you hear. It was rock and roll. And so
[1:13:59] the other girl was at the top of the
[1:14:01] piano. She's down here in the bass. And
[1:14:02] they're having a good time.
[1:14:04] So his heart's pounding and he goes to
[1:14:06] knocks on the door. Well, they happen to
[1:14:09] hear it. She comes to the door. Now, he
[1:14:12] was a balanced individual.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; He didn't jerk his belt off, make a
[1:14:17] scene. No. All he said, "It's time to
[1:14:19] go."
[1:14:21] Now, a lot of times like that, he was
[1:14:23] human. He had to bite his tongue. It's
[1:14:25] time to go. So, we go. She didn't hear a
[1:14:28] word about it for two months. See, but
[1:14:30] the parents are praying now. When he
[1:14:32] tells the story, the same thing in uh
[1:14:36] August of ' 64,
[1:14:38] he paints the picture how bad the piano
[1:14:41] was. Oh, horrible. You know, she says,
[1:14:44] "But then she met George and he's a
[1:14:46] Christian." End of problem.
[1:14:50] It's his daughter.
[1:14:52] But I was taking him to the Baptist
[1:14:54] church and he wasn't glad for it. Yeah.
[1:14:57] And he went sometimes with us. So when
[1:15:00] you're on vacation, I don't want to hear
[1:15:01] this story about no place to go to
[1:15:02] church.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; There's churches everywhere.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; I can feel God a little bit in the
[1:15:09] Catholic church.
[1:15:11] or the Methodist or whatever. So,
[1:15:14] God is everywhere. Okay, you go get your
[1:15:16] little slice.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Well, anyway, so we're we're going to
[1:15:19] the Baptist church and um
[1:15:22] uh the uh the first meeting I went to
[1:15:26] was in June of 63. He preached in Tucson
[1:15:31] and for the first time I'm seeing him at
[1:15:33] the pullpit. Now, he didn't give me a
[1:15:35] list of tapes to listen to. You got to
[1:15:37] read these books. No, none of that. He
[1:15:39] trusted me cuz see what I realized a
[1:15:41] little later was on that first time we
[1:15:44] were meeting
[1:15:46] it was like he was scanning the hard
[1:15:47] drive.
[1:15:51] Yeah. And so he knew who I was. He could
[1:15:55] trust me with his daughter. So don't you
[1:15:58] guys try that because your daddy ain't
[1:15:59] no prophet.
[1:16:02] Um,
[1:16:04] so at this at this meeting in ' 63, this
[1:16:06] first meeting, man, I'm just amazed.
[1:16:09] Everything he says right here in the
[1:16:10] Bible, what's what's the problem? And so
[1:16:12] when I was going home that night, I uh I
[1:16:16] was praying. I said, "Lord, this is
[1:16:17] either something comes directly from you
[1:16:19] like he's saying,
[1:16:21] or it's the biggest hoax that ever hit
[1:16:22] the planet." I mean, it was one or the
[1:16:25] other. And so God began to reveal that,
[1:16:27] you know, it's right here in the word.
[1:16:28] Yeah. No problem. So some people can
[1:16:32] look at the message and see God in
[1:16:35] action. Others see all kinds of mistakes
[1:16:38] because this isn't for everybody.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; In every group right here, there's three
[1:16:44] kinds of believers.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know who you are, but you
[1:16:48] know who you are.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; And what we do as uh you know, smart
[1:16:52] Americans, we look around and we start
[1:16:54] figuring out, okay, that one's
[1:16:56] unbeliever, that one's a makeeliever.
[1:16:59] That's not important. Who are you?
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Get yourself straightened up, you know.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, um,
[1:17:08] so what I want to tell you about is what
[1:17:10] we call the prophetic dimension. Now,
[1:17:13] you might not like that word, but it's
[1:17:15] just something that that is real because
[1:17:17] you you have like over here in the Old
[1:17:19] Testament, you got Elisha where he was
[1:17:21] in the house with his helper, guy that's
[1:17:24] helping him there, and he said, "Go look
[1:17:26] outside, see what's going on." So the
[1:17:27] helper goes outside and all he can see
[1:17:29] is soldiers with swords because they're
[1:17:32] looking for Elisha, you know, and
[1:17:34] they're and and they're upset. So he
[1:17:37] comes back, he's trembling, "Oh, we've
[1:17:38] had it. They're going to kill us." Now
[1:17:40] Elisha didn't take his belt off and whip
[1:17:42] him. He didn't smack him. He just put
[1:17:44] his hand on him, said, "Lord, open the
[1:17:46] young man's eyes."
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Everything was calm. He goes back out
[1:17:50] there and there all these angels.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Where'd they come from? They were there
[1:17:56] all the time.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; That's a prophetic dimension. Okay, it's
[1:17:59] faster than this one.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; And so, um, and so what happened was
[1:18:04] that then, um, in in Brother Brandham's
[1:18:06] life, that happened all the time. Now,
[1:18:08] see, if he was here and he saw these 460
[1:18:11] people or whatever's here, he'd go home
[1:18:13] say, "Oh, we had a great meeting now.
[1:18:14] There's thousand people there." Now,
[1:18:17] it's not that he's so bad about judging
[1:18:19] numbers. It's just that he sees more
[1:18:21] than what I see,
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; you know. So, in one one uh occasion
[1:18:26] back in January of 1950,
[1:18:29] he was in a 10 night meeting in Houston,
[1:18:32] Texas, and there's people being healed
[1:18:34] and a lot of things happening. But there
[1:18:36] was a Baptist minister that thought it
[1:18:38] was his job to prove that this is wrong.
[1:18:40] It's of the devil and so forth. And he
[1:18:42] was making a big scene. And so, Brother
[1:18:44] Bosworth, who was helping Brother Random
[1:18:46] at the time, said, "Now, Brother Ram, we
[1:18:48] got to do something. It's in the
[1:18:49] newspapers. We're looking bad." And
[1:18:51] brother Ram said, "We're not going to
[1:18:52] take you waste one night with that guy
[1:18:54] when we got, you know, hundreds to be
[1:18:56] prayed for. We're not going to waste
[1:18:58] time." So finally, Brother Brandham uh
[1:19:02] was convinced, okay, you know, Brother
[1:19:04] Bosford said, "I can do it. I won't be a
[1:19:07] problem." Okay. So he turned him loose,
[1:19:09] got the newspapers. So a bunch more
[1:19:12] people came into town to back up divine
[1:19:14] healing because Brother Ram had friends
[1:19:16] everywhere. Well, when you listen to
[1:19:18] tape, he says we went from, I think it's
[1:19:20] five or six thousand people to over here
[1:19:22] in this auditorium for 30,000.
[1:19:25] But here again, you can go check it
[1:19:28] yourself. That auditorium only had 9,000
[1:19:31] seats. So, he's seeing a whole lot more
[1:19:33] than what we're seeing. You know, these
[1:19:35] aren't mistakes.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; This is a supernatural ministry from a
[1:19:40] supernatural God. And if you don't
[1:19:42] believe in the supernatural, you're
[1:19:43] sitting in the wrong church.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:19:47] So, they have the debate. Brother Random
[1:19:49] was going to stay in the hotel. Now, you
[1:19:51] probably know most of this, but I'm
[1:19:52] telling you from a different angle. He
[1:19:55] says, "I'm going to stay in the hotel.
[1:19:56] You guys have at it, and I'll be back
[1:19:57] tomorrow night." So, the Holy Ghost
[1:19:59] says, "No, you must be there." So, he
[1:20:01] gets ready.
[1:20:03] He comes to church. There's him and his
[1:20:05] wife, his brother, and four-year-old
[1:20:08] Rebecca.
[1:20:10] Now,
[1:20:12] he says he came into the service
[1:20:13] disguised. I don't know what he was
[1:20:15] wearing. He never explained that. But
[1:20:17] nobody knew he was there. Okay. And he
[1:20:20] goes way up in the balcony where he
[1:20:21] could see directly to the pulpit. And
[1:20:23] he's sitting up there and he's watching
[1:20:24] the goings on down here at the pulpit.
[1:20:27] And so, Brother Bosworth says to the to
[1:20:30] the Baptist, "Now, sir, in the Old
[1:20:32] Testament, we have we have seven
[1:20:34] compound names of redemption of
[1:20:36] Jehovah." Yes, that's right. Now, can we
[1:20:39] apply those to Jesus Christ? Yes or no?
[1:20:42] Well, the Baptist had to think a minute
[1:20:43] because if I say no, there's no
[1:20:45] salvation. And if I say yes, then it
[1:20:47] includes divine healing.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; And I don't know about now, but at that
[1:20:51] time they they wouldn't allow divine
[1:20:53] healing to be in the atonement. So all
[1:20:56] this is not right. Well, anyway, so they
[1:20:59] had the debate. They, you know, didn't
[1:21:02] get ugly, but it's just they had some
[1:21:04] words. So finally, brother Bodsworth
[1:21:06] said, "Now we we don't know if Brother
[1:21:09] Brand was here." It's like here. I I
[1:21:11] can't really point somebody else. I can
[1:21:13] see some of you, but if there's 10,000
[1:21:16] people or more, who knows who's out
[1:21:18] there? He said, "If brother Rand was
[1:21:20] here, he's welcome to come down. Dismiss
[1:21:22] the audience." So, Brother Brham gets up
[1:21:24] from his chair. Now, before that, he's
[1:21:27] got Rebecca on his lap, just like some
[1:21:28] of you guys hold on your little girl.
[1:21:30] Well, this is the first time that
[1:21:32] Rebecca got to sit with her dad in
[1:21:33] church because all the other times her
[1:21:35] dad's up here and all the other little
[1:21:37] girls are sitting with her dad and she
[1:21:39] was, you know, feeling left out.
[1:21:44] So, when he gets up to come down here,
[1:21:46] he puts Rebecca in in his seat and she
[1:21:49] always said she could remember seeing
[1:21:50] the souls of his feet as he went down
[1:21:52] the steps. Okay.
[1:21:55] So, he comes down to the um platform and
[1:21:59] the Baptist had a couple of of uh
[1:22:02] professional photographers over here
[1:22:04] because he wants pictures because he's
[1:22:05] going to win. He's going to show these
[1:22:06] pictures and so forth. And so, they're
[1:22:08] taking pictures,
[1:22:11] but when Brother M describes it, he says
[1:22:13] there was all these people. Now, a lot
[1:22:15] of them were sick people. See, most of
[1:22:17] us here are well. We had a good
[1:22:20] breakfast. We drove church, a nice car.
[1:22:22] Well, back then 1950, it was a different
[1:22:24] story. If you were sick or you had your
[1:22:27] mother sick or whatever you had pro
[1:22:28] wrong, you want to go where the man of
[1:22:30] God was.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; So, here's all these people. He said
[1:22:33] there was cases there that would make
[1:22:34] the heart of an iron man melt.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, he said 500 ushers made a
[1:22:42] path for him to come down here. Okay?
[1:22:43] Because everybody want to touch him.
[1:22:45] Well, he gets down here and says a few
[1:22:47] words
[1:22:49] and um and he said, "I don't need to say
[1:22:52] anymore. He's present." I don't know if
[1:22:54] you guys have the picture back there.
[1:22:55] Can you put the picture, the halo on the
[1:22:57] screen? Because the only picture that
[1:22:59] came out of that whole evening was the
[1:23:00] one picture. They went to develop their
[1:23:02] pictures. Only one came out. And so, um,
[1:23:06] Brother Ram said, "It's better for you
[1:23:08] to have this picture than if the real
[1:23:10] thing came in the room
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; because your eyes could deceive you, you
[1:23:14] know."
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; And so, in another place, he uh he's
[1:23:17] praying. He's preaching and and he's got
[1:23:20] this prayer line and here's this lady
[1:23:22] with with this picture. And so, in order
[1:23:25] to establish contact, he starts talking
[1:23:26] to her. He says, "You know, let's talk
[1:23:28] about that picture." He says, "On my
[1:23:31] desk at home, I've got a testimony of a
[1:23:34] lady that was in the hospital and she
[1:23:36] was dying. They didn't give her up." And
[1:23:39] so, she's there and on the nightstand
[1:23:41] next to the bed is the, you know, the
[1:23:44] Houston picture. And um and so her
[1:23:48] testimony was that while she's praying,
[1:23:49] the light came off of the picture and
[1:23:53] stood over her and she got well and went
[1:23:54] home.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; And that's happened several times that
[1:23:56] I've heard it since. So eventually
[1:23:59] they'll find the picture and
[1:24:02] yeah, but anyway, the uh fact is the
[1:24:06] moral of the story is years later when
[1:24:08] Rebecca's listening to the tape like we
[1:24:10] do, um she hears him tell these facts
[1:24:13] and she says to her mom, "Now mom,
[1:24:15] you're the only one there that I
[1:24:16] remember. Did you see those 500 ushers?"
[1:24:20] "No, dear. Those were angels,
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; just like in the days of Elisha."
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; And they're here, too. they're just in a
[1:24:27] faster dimension. We don't need them
[1:24:29] right now. Okay. So that's that's the
[1:24:32] prophetic dimension. And um
[1:24:36] so we're still 1963.
[1:24:39] And so when the Okay, there's the
[1:24:41] picture right there. So if you don't
[1:24:43] have that picture, you need to get it
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; somewhere. Um thank you. So in December
[1:24:49] of 63, the Brandoms are going to go away
[1:24:51] to Indiana for two weeks. But you know,
[1:24:55] when you're young and you're full of
[1:24:57] life and you're in love and your
[1:25:00] girlfriend goes away for two weeks,
[1:25:03] well, two weeks a time, you know,
[1:25:07] you know, thump.
[1:25:09] And so I caught a ride with some other
[1:25:12] people and it was just a miracle we made
[1:25:15] because it drove straight through, you
[1:25:16] know, 30 hours. Anyway, we got there
[1:25:18] early Sunday morning of uh December 29
[1:25:22] and I uh you know surprised him. So,
[1:25:25] here I am in the Brandon Tabernacle
[1:25:26] first time. Wow, all these people. And
[1:25:29] of course, the man's got plenty of
[1:25:30] liberty at the church at the tabernacle
[1:25:32] and he um he's preaching. Well, when we
[1:25:36] went to lunch that day, he uh he knew
[1:25:40] that we were, you know, in school
[1:25:41] together and he knew that we were in
[1:25:43] music and that I was helping lead
[1:25:46] singing at the Baptist church. So, at
[1:25:48] lunch, he says, "Now, George, I want you
[1:25:49] to sing tonight." I said, "Me singing
[1:25:52] Brandon Tabernacle?" Yeah. Yeah. What
[1:25:55] would I sing? Well, he said, "Now,
[1:25:57] tonight we're going to have a prayer
[1:25:58] line. So, it'd be good if you could sing
[1:26:00] Then Jesus Came." Well, I didn't know
[1:26:03] that song.
[1:26:06] you know,
[1:26:08] hadn't heard it in the Baptist church,
[1:26:10] but um I learned it that afternoon and
[1:26:15] sang it and he was very pleased and he
[1:26:17] was pleased that his daughter was
[1:26:19] playing for first time in church
[1:26:21] and then he preached the uh looking away
[1:26:25] to Jesus. Yeah. Looking away to Jesus.
[1:26:27] That was December 29th, 1963. Well, time
[1:26:32] progresses and we graduated together in
[1:26:35] May of 1964.
[1:26:38] So, you probably already figured out my
[1:26:39] age, but it's okay. Uh, at my age, I can
[1:26:42] repeat sometimes. You know, when you're
[1:26:44] younger, you can't do that. And I hope
[1:26:47] the translators are getting this for the
[1:26:53] see. Okay. So uh
[1:26:58] so we we graduate in ' 64 and our
[1:27:00] parents are in the you know in the
[1:27:02] audience happy day and brother Brandham
[1:27:05] made the comment at last a Brandom has
[1:27:07] graduated
[1:27:09] because nobody finished school before
[1:27:10] that you know well in July of ' 64 he
[1:27:14] was preaching in Philadelphia
[1:27:17] um and so when you went to church with
[1:27:19] brother Brandham uh you'd get there late
[1:27:22] he he got there in time to come to the
[1:27:24] pull pit
[1:27:25] So when they got to this big auditorium,
[1:27:27] every seat's taken. Well, here's Brother
[1:27:30] Brandham and Billy Paul and the two
[1:27:32] girls, Rebecca and her friend Betty.
[1:27:35] Well, there's no seats. So they found
[1:27:36] him a couple seats up in the mezzanine
[1:27:38] where they could see. And um so they're
[1:27:42] up there. When Brother Ram comes to the
[1:27:44] service, there was a long table, you
[1:27:46] know, parallel to the uh to the pulpit.
[1:27:49] And his chair was right right beside the
[1:27:52] pulpit. brother or Roberts was speaking
[1:27:55] and he was going to be next. So, while
[1:27:57] he's sitting there,
[1:28:00] um he uh he looked down and he saw that
[1:28:04] his pants didn't match his his coat, you
[1:28:07] know, and so he reaches over very
[1:28:10] carefully and he he feels brother
[1:28:14] or Robert's coat, you know, it's like
[1:28:16] that real real gently. And uh then he
[1:28:19] gets up and he preaches the the mighty
[1:28:20] message, you know, the mighty God
[1:28:21] unveiled. Well, when they're going back
[1:28:23] to the hotel, Rebecca said, "I saw what
[1:28:26] you did."
[1:28:29] He said, "Oh, sis, you wouldn't believe
[1:28:31] the suit. It's probably $1,000 silk,
[1:28:34] whatever, you know, 1964."
[1:28:37] And he looked down and he didn't match.
[1:28:39] He had the brown coat and the black
[1:28:40] pants or whatever combination, but it
[1:28:42] didn't matter. It was clean. You know,
[1:28:44] his his outfit was probably $49.95.
[1:28:48] And but what's the point? Both men are
[1:28:51] called of God.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; One had to have everything goldplated
[1:28:54] perfectly. You know, the other one was
[1:28:57] more important what he had to say.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; And he he liked nice things, but he
[1:29:02] didn't have to have the best, you know,
[1:29:04] just let's get it done, you know. Well,
[1:29:07] in another occasion, he's preaching, and
[1:29:10] you'll find this on tape where that um
[1:29:12] he's in a big auditorium, you know, big
[1:29:14] curtain behind him. And so he gets to
[1:29:16] the end of the services and I want to
[1:29:18] show you all what is the secret of the
[1:29:20] success of these meetings. So they raise
[1:29:23] the curtain and there's old John Ryan
[1:29:25] with a little white beard out flat on
[1:29:27] his face praying. He said that's why we
[1:29:29] have success in these meetings.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Rem didn't have a push button
[1:29:33] ministry. See we like to think that
[1:29:34] because you know we're 60 70 years later
[1:29:38] but uh as one that was there no he
[1:29:41] struggled all the time. He walked by
[1:29:44] faith.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. when he when he was going to
[1:29:46] preach the seals. Okay, he's been
[1:29:48] preparing for it. He studied, but he
[1:29:51] still didn't have all the answers. When
[1:29:54] he's on the way to the pulpit for the
[1:29:56] first service, he said that he stopped
[1:29:58] by Billy Paul's office and said, "Billy,
[1:30:00] if you ever pray for dad, pray now. I
[1:30:04] don't know what I'm going to say to
[1:30:04] these people."
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; And they're all waiting, you know. And
[1:30:08] so even when he's when he's preaching
[1:30:10] the seals, he he's getting through this
[1:30:13] service, no clue what's coming next, but
[1:30:17] he he walked by faith.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; One step at a time.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; So don't think that God's going to show
[1:30:23] you three miles ahead. No.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; For today,
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; stay balanced.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, um
[1:30:31] Okay, we got to tell you something about
[1:30:33] the courtship. Yeah, because that's
[1:30:34] important. Um,
[1:30:38] I wasn't dating the prophet's daughter
[1:30:40] as such. This was the daughter of
[1:30:42] William Brano. We were good friends. He
[1:30:44] was a good preacher. I didn't know all
[1:30:46] that I know today. Okay. I was focused
[1:30:49] on the girl and everything was working
[1:30:51] just fine. But we had to we had to be in
[1:30:54] by 11 o'clock. We couldn't be out, you
[1:30:56] know, late or couldn't be on on certain
[1:30:58] nights of the week and so forth. Now,
[1:31:01] um, when we moved into our house down
[1:31:03] the street, we had a black phone on the
[1:31:06] wall with the dial. Everybody over 50
[1:31:09] remembers those, right? Okay. We're over
[1:31:11] here in the antique shop. And, uh, so
[1:31:14] when Brother Ram got his phone installed
[1:31:15] in ' 63,
[1:31:17] um, it's a it's a desk phone and it's
[1:31:22] push button, but it's still, you know,
[1:31:24] there's a receiver. You couldn't walk
[1:31:26] away with it. It's plugged to the wall.
[1:31:29] And so people found out about his number
[1:31:31] and they would call him for everything,
[1:31:34] you know, the white car or the red car.
[1:31:36] They see me and Ron, we'd say, "Who
[1:31:38] cares?" But he was kind. He would be
[1:31:42] nice to people. But he had enough of it.
[1:31:44] So one day he's looking at the phone and
[1:31:46] he turns it over and there's a dial on
[1:31:48] the back of that phone. And you could
[1:31:50] dial it one way and the ringer got
[1:31:52] louder. You dial it the other way and
[1:31:54] the ringer call goes off.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Well, that was the easy solution. So, he
[1:31:59] can't hear it. Now, if I'm calling up
[1:32:01] there, I could hear the phone ring, but
[1:32:03] he can't hear it ring. And so, he's got
[1:32:06] it off.
[1:32:08] And so, Rebecca says, "What are we going
[1:32:09] to do?" Now, we were teenagers.
[1:32:13] We had teenage brain.
[1:32:17] we didn't have these little guys, you
[1:32:19] know, and so we um
[1:32:23] we didn't uh we didn't have the
[1:32:27] the things we have today, but we only
[1:32:30] lived a block and a half away, but we
[1:32:32] like to talk on the phone. I don't know
[1:32:34] why. It's just the way it is. And so, um
[1:32:39] uh she said, "What are you going to do?"
[1:32:41] Said, "Look, it's real simple. See, man,
[1:32:44] we always figure it out, right?"
[1:32:47] said, "Let's go line up our clocks."
[1:32:49] Exactly. Right. Okay. Same time. Now, at
[1:32:52] my house, I had younger brothers and
[1:32:53] sisters. I had to figure out a good time
[1:32:55] when my dad was busy watching ball game
[1:32:57] or something and I didn't have access to
[1:32:59] the phone. So, I said, "At 7:00, I'm
[1:33:02] going to call you." Now, thanks to your
[1:33:04] dad, there's no ringing, but uh at 7 you
[1:33:07] pick it up, I'll be there. So, she picks
[1:33:10] it up. Hello. And since it had a long
[1:33:13] cord, she could take this phone into
[1:33:15] the, you know, closet and shut the door
[1:33:18] and we had a little privacy.
[1:33:21] You see, love conquers all.
[1:33:27] So sometimes, brother Brandham would
[1:33:30] offer us the use of his Cadillac. Now,
[1:33:32] back then that was the best on the
[1:33:35] market. Okay, today you have many
[1:33:36] choices. Cadillac ends up being one of
[1:33:38] the uglier cars, but back then it was a
[1:33:41] real nice car.
[1:33:43] So, I had a Ford truck and my Ford truck
[1:33:47] was two doors, no hair, no stereo, you
[1:33:51] know, three-speed,
[1:33:53] real simple. And so, sometimes he would
[1:33:55] offer his Cadillac. Now, why did he have
[1:33:57] a Cadillac? Okay, the Christian
[1:33:59] businessmen that loved him, they wanted
[1:34:01] him to have a new Cadillac every year.
[1:34:03] He said, "No, station wagon's fine for
[1:34:05] me." But finally when brother
[1:34:09] Arganbright out in California was
[1:34:11] getting delivery of his 56 Cadillac, he
[1:34:14] gives the keys to the 55 Cadillac. Okay,
[1:34:16] you guys drive this back there to this
[1:34:18] address. Park it. Give them the keys.
[1:34:19] Don't talk to anybody. Leave. So they
[1:34:22] left it. It's parked there. Well,
[1:34:24] brother Ren comes back from trip
[1:34:26] someplace. What's this big blue and
[1:34:27] white card in my driveway? And so his
[1:34:30] wife said, "Well, these guys left it
[1:34:32] here." Well, he puts it in the garage
[1:34:34] and it sat in the garage for several
[1:34:36] months until he put a little disclaimer
[1:34:38] in the newspaper. This isn't worth your
[1:34:40] money. This is a gift, you know, and
[1:34:43] they drove it everywhere after that. So,
[1:34:45] anyway, so they got this station wagon
[1:34:47] and they got this Cadillac. Any of you
[1:34:49] know about cars? They're about 30 ft
[1:34:51] long, had had a big V8 engine, two four
[1:34:55] barrel carburetors. It was a nice car,
[1:34:58] good air conditioning. And so when he
[1:35:00] said, "Uh, take my car." Said, "Well,
[1:35:02] thank you, sir. Park the truck, take the
[1:35:05] car." But see, the car had we had to put
[1:35:08] the expensive gas in that. See, I could
[1:35:11] I could fill my tank with uh gasoline at
[1:35:14] like 23 cents a gallon.
[1:35:18] This is way back. But and there was no
[1:35:20] self pump. No, you had to have the guy
[1:35:22] come out and do all that. But the car
[1:35:24] you had to put in the gasoline. It was
[1:35:26] 36 cents a gallon. So, we get $2 at a
[1:35:29] time, you know.
[1:35:32] Well, um those are some of the the
[1:35:34] trials we went through, but you know, um
[1:35:38] so here I am in this Ford pickup and
[1:35:40] we're going to church and we um stopped
[1:35:44] by to get Rebecca. Well, I'm driving and
[1:35:46] there's Rebecca and my sister. And then
[1:35:48] in the back was three or four brothers
[1:35:50] and sisters, you know. And so he'd come
[1:35:52] out to say goodbye to us and he said,
[1:35:55] "My, what a fine truckload of preachers
[1:35:57] you have here." I didn't see any
[1:35:59] preachers, just little brothers. You
[1:36:01] know how little brothers are. They're in
[1:36:03] the way. And um time passes. Sure
[1:36:07] enough, all four of them
[1:36:09] went through Bible school, had
[1:36:11] missionary church. They're all good
[1:36:13] Baptist preachers because see, I was the
[1:36:16] first, but eventually there was five
[1:36:18] boys and five girls. Yeah.
[1:36:21] And so, um,
[1:36:24] yeah, sometimes brother Rand would, you
[1:36:25] know, go to, uh, go to church with us.
[1:36:27] He he lived here in the word. Now, by
[1:36:30] the end of ' 64, the Lord says to
[1:36:33] Brother Random, you you need to find a
[1:36:35] house. You're going to stay. You know,
[1:36:37] this is not temporary now. You can stay.
[1:36:39] So, they started looking for a house.
[1:36:40] The businessman offered him a house up
[1:36:42] here in Phoenix. I think at the time it
[1:36:47] was worth like 100,000 or something.
[1:36:50] And he said to me, "Now, George, how can
[1:36:52] I live in a house like that? Big fancy
[1:36:54] driveway, big house, and people come in
[1:36:57] a little shibby to be prayed for. That
[1:36:58] won't work." And so the Lord directed
[1:37:01] him to the house that many of you know
[1:37:03] about there in Tucson. And so it was a
[1:37:06] house that was almost finished. The guy
[1:37:07] built it a year or so before and he
[1:37:10] didn't quite finish. It didn't have any
[1:37:12] carpet and a few things. You know, he'll
[1:37:14] leave that for the the owner to do as
[1:37:16] they please. So, Brother Rem's making
[1:37:19] the deal and he's standing in the
[1:37:20] doorway looking out and he loved this
[1:37:23] property because they had space out here
[1:37:24] to put the dinner room he always wanted,
[1:37:26] put his trophies in, so forth. And so,
[1:37:28] he's standing in the doorway and the own
[1:37:30] the builder standing outside looking in.
[1:37:33] And so, they're they're discussing the
[1:37:35] price and everything. Well, in the
[1:37:36] meantime, here's here's Joseph about
[1:37:38] eight years old and he's he's running
[1:37:40] his hand up the door jam. You know how
[1:37:41] kids do. And so, Brother Ram doesn't
[1:37:44] take his eyes off the guy. they're
[1:37:46] talking and so all of a sudden he goes
[1:37:48] in his pocket and gets out his knife and
[1:37:50] sticks it in the hole there where the
[1:37:52] lock is and out comes a scorpion. So he
[1:37:55] he he could see that well in another
[1:37:58] dimension. He wasn't looking at it. But
[1:38:00] those kind of things were common with
[1:38:02] him. Okay.
[1:38:04] Um there was a time when Rebecca was
[1:38:06] telling us that they were in a in a
[1:38:08] restaurant and they were u having lunch
[1:38:12] and there was um a policeman another
[1:38:14] table and as soon as the policeman's
[1:38:16] food came well his radio started making
[1:38:19] noise. He had to jump up and leave and
[1:38:21] the lights are flashing and so uh you
[1:38:24] know brother Brent's still eating. He
[1:38:26] said nothing to worry about. He said
[1:38:28] over there a few blocks little boy fell
[1:38:29] out of a tree and broke his arm but he's
[1:38:30] going to be okay. So Rebecca said, "Now
[1:38:33] we knew everybody's daddy didn't do
[1:38:34] that."
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, um, so all during the end of '
[1:38:41] 64 and ' 65, they're um they're working
[1:38:44] on this house, you know, finishing it,
[1:38:48] doing details. And so in ' 65,
[1:38:52] um, I guess I was real brave at the
[1:38:55] time. Uh, I didn't have baptism right
[1:38:58] yet. Didn't have the Holy Ghost. Didn't
[1:38:59] have a job. Didn't have a car. Oh, yeah.
[1:39:01] I did have a car. And so anyway, we
[1:39:03] talked and so it's time for me to go
[1:39:05] talk to the man.
[1:39:07] So I had to find time when he's not busy
[1:39:10] and I could talk to him. And I said,
[1:39:12] "Now, Brother Bram, um, I'm here to
[1:39:16] talk." So he starts talking. Well, he
[1:39:18] knew I was there. So he starts talking.
[1:39:20] We we'd run around the world. He did all
[1:39:22] kinds of different things. And
[1:39:26] so finally I said, "Now, Brother Bram,
[1:39:27] all this is beautiful, but I'm here for
[1:39:29] a purpose.
[1:39:31] What would that be? Well,
[1:39:34] you must have noticed that I I really
[1:39:36] think highly of your daughter. And so,
[1:39:38] I'm here to ask for your permission and
[1:39:40] your blessing to be married.
[1:39:43] And he's got the eyes got rather narrow.
[1:39:46] He said, "Look, George, I'll give you
[1:39:48] all permission to be engaged, but don't
[1:39:51] even think about marriage until you both
[1:39:53] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost." So,
[1:39:56] that's good for today also.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:00] And so, uh, I said, "Thank you, sir."
[1:40:03] Life went on. Now, a smart person would
[1:40:06] have been on their knees, right? But
[1:40:07] what's next? Well, God had a way of
[1:40:09] doing things.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; And so,
[1:40:13] um, in July, here they go away again,
[1:40:17] you know, and I don't know how I got
[1:40:18] there, but I was there for like 10 days
[1:40:20] or two weeks to Indiana. And so I was
[1:40:25] there when he was preaching the
[1:40:26] anointing once at the end time and some
[1:40:28] of those powerful messages there in July
[1:40:30] 64, but it was kind of going over my
[1:40:32] head, but I I was there. I I saw. And so
[1:40:35] on August 1st, he preached in the
[1:40:37] morning and then it must have been after
[1:40:40] the evening service.
[1:40:43] I asked him, I said, "Now before we get
[1:40:44] in the car to go back to Indiana, will
[1:40:47] there be time for you to baptize me
[1:40:49] correctly?" Oh, sure. So, Monday
[1:40:52] afternoon, um, August the 2nd, uh, we
[1:40:56] went to the church and he baptized me in
[1:40:59] Christian baptism. Okay. So, turned out
[1:41:04] that was the last person he baptized,
[1:41:05] too. You know, we found out later. Um,
[1:41:09] so I were back in in Tucson, August of '
[1:41:12] 65, and I had the had the baptism,
[1:41:15] right? I had the car, had the girl under
[1:41:18] contract, you know. So, we're making
[1:41:21] progress
[1:41:23] and um so we're driving around in my car
[1:41:25] and he boy this is nice. It was just me
[1:41:27] and me to you know but anyway he liked
[1:41:30] it. So out of seemed like out of nowhere
[1:41:32] he said now now George if you ever have
[1:41:34] a chance to go to Israel your Bible will
[1:41:37] be a brand new book. Well I wasn't
[1:41:40] thinking about the book. I wasn't
[1:41:41] thinking about Israel. I was thinking
[1:41:43] about the girl.
[1:41:46] But that's what he said. Well, I don't
[1:41:48] know why, but in, you know, eight years
[1:41:50] later in 73,
[1:41:53] we made our first trip. Sure enough.
[1:41:55] Wow. Very different. And um so in 2023,
[1:42:02] you know, two years ago is trip number
[1:42:05] 48. And the Lord Terry's will have a
[1:42:09] trip or two this year. So there's plans.
[1:42:13] Well,
[1:42:14] um, here we are, August of 65 and, um,
[1:42:19] they're finishing the house. It's
[1:42:20] looking good. Got the driveway in,
[1:42:22] carpet, and different things. Well,
[1:42:24] Brother Perry Green was, you know,
[1:42:26] thinking seriously, moving to Tucson.
[1:42:28] But at home in in Texas, his mother was
[1:42:31] a seamstress, and so he'd already taken
[1:42:34] some measurements, and she was making
[1:42:36] curtains for this new house. So, he's in
[1:42:38] town to, you know, put up the curtains.
[1:42:41] And um
[1:42:43] uh so while he's there, he had a couple
[1:42:46] of services that rented a place, but um
[1:42:49] you know, I'm I'm just a teenager. I'm
[1:42:51] not really involved in a lot of things.
[1:42:54] So
[1:42:56] during that visit, Brother Brandon says
[1:42:57] to Brother Green, "It looks like this
[1:42:59] kid's going to be my son-in-law. Please
[1:43:01] take him home and pray for the Holy
[1:43:03] Ghost." Okay. Well, now you all know
[1:43:06] Brother Perry. Most of you do. He's
[1:43:08] bigger than life. And uh you know the
[1:43:12] way he was talking I thought I was on
[1:43:14] vacation big ranch house you know and
[1:43:16] pool and whatever. No such luck. No I go
[1:43:20] with him. We get to Bulmont Texas very
[1:43:22] hot humid. He lived in a two room house
[1:43:27] behind the church and my room didn't
[1:43:29] have air conditioning. And anyway so and
[1:43:32] I didn't know why I was there. Nobody
[1:43:33] told me I was going over there for the
[1:43:34] Holy Ghost. I was on vacation, you know.
[1:43:38] Anyway, um
[1:43:41] so about the second day I'm there,
[1:43:43] Brother Richard Blair came over from
[1:43:45] Louisiana to use Brother Green's phone
[1:43:46] to call Brother Brandham in Tucson. And
[1:43:49] so when he called, Brother Brandham was
[1:43:51] already out of the house, but they put
[1:43:52] his name down. He'll call you as soon as
[1:43:54] he comes back. Okay. So they're there
[1:43:56] waiting for this phone call all day. I'm
[1:43:58] over in my room reading my Bible. And
[1:44:00] somehow I felt inspired to go over there
[1:44:02] and see if the three of us could pray
[1:44:04] together. Okay. So, we're kneeling in
[1:44:07] the bench praying. While we're praying,
[1:44:10] um the um what I could see in my mind
[1:44:13] was a was a cloudy day and then streams
[1:44:16] of life come through, some sunlight
[1:44:18] coming down like pencil, you know,
[1:44:21] that's what I could see in my mind.
[1:44:22] Well, soon after that, the phone rings.
[1:44:25] Well, it's Brother Brandham calling for
[1:44:28] brother Blair. Brother Green answers his
[1:44:31] phone. Oh, just a minute, sir. He,
[1:44:33] brother Bram says, "But first, let me
[1:44:35] talk to George." Okay. So, greeted him.
[1:44:38] He said, "I want to be the first to
[1:44:40] congratulate you on receiving the
[1:44:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost."
[1:44:44] Well, I knew something was happening,
[1:44:46] but he knew how hard-headed I was. So,
[1:44:48] he was explaining to me what what just
[1:44:51] happened. And from then on, it just got
[1:44:54] bigger and bigger and bigger. You don't
[1:44:56] get it all at one time, but that's how
[1:44:59] it started.
[1:45:01] Well, the next day I get a call from my
[1:45:03] mother also in Tucson and she said, 'We
[1:45:05] have a letter here from President
[1:45:06] Johnson. They need you in the military.
[1:45:10] Okay. So, I come back over here and uh
[1:45:14] within a week I was a US soldier with
[1:45:17] the Holy Ghost. So, so far so good. Um,
[1:45:23] so now I'm in I'm I'm in Louisiana in
[1:45:25] basic training and finishing up the
[1:45:27] first six weeks of basic training down
[1:45:29] towards Thanksgiving. And um, Brother
[1:45:32] Brandham's preaching up in Shreport.
[1:45:33] It's just 80 miles away. So I got, you
[1:45:36] know, pass and Rebecca drove down,
[1:45:38] picked me up, go to the services. Well,
[1:45:40] on Saturday, I had some time with
[1:45:42] brother Brandham and I was burdened
[1:45:44] because here I'm, you know, I have no no
[1:45:48] uh, training yet. It's just basic. I
[1:45:50] don't know if they're going to make a
[1:45:50] soldier and kill people. What I'm going
[1:45:52] to do? And so um he um uh he wasn't real
[1:45:57] busy Saturday morning. And so I I just
[1:46:01] expressed myself, you know, briefly. He
[1:46:03] says, "George, don't worry. Footsteps of
[1:46:06] the righteous are ordered of the Lord.
[1:46:08] No prayer, no nothing."
[1:46:11] Well, good. That took the burden off me.
[1:46:13] He he called me a righteous person, so
[1:46:14] that's all I needed, you know. And um
[1:46:19] anyway, just quoted the scripture. So in
[1:46:22] December of ' 65, I was home for several
[1:46:26] weeks, you know, free from the military.
[1:46:30] I remember helping him put some of the
[1:46:31] beds together for the house cuz he
[1:46:33] wanted to get it all done because the
[1:46:34] plan was that they were going to go to
[1:46:36] Jeffersonville, preach, pick up the new
[1:46:37] car, and come back. And so in the
[1:46:40] meantime, Rebecca was going to stay in
[1:46:41] town, move stuff out of the apartment
[1:46:43] into the house so they come right to the
[1:46:45] new house. Okay. Now, he didn't trade
[1:46:48] cars because he was, you know, uh,
[1:46:50] egoomaniac. No, he traded cars because
[1:46:53] of high mileage. And if he didn't know
[1:46:56] about cars, you look at them, you don't
[1:46:58] know which one's the new one because he
[1:46:59] kept it perfect condition. Well,
[1:47:03] so the idea was to leave on the on
[1:47:05] Saturday the 18th to drive back. Now,
[1:47:09] when he um when he traveled, sometimes
[1:47:13] he drove by himself. Yeah. A lot of
[1:47:16] two-lane roads. And so, he liked to
[1:47:18] leave early. 6:00. He's he's moving. You
[1:47:21] all can go to sleep. No problem. We're
[1:47:23] going to get there today. And so, he
[1:47:25] would leave early. And um he had certain
[1:47:28] certain rules. If it was just him by
[1:47:31] himself or with Billy, he would dress in
[1:47:33] blue jeans and boots and didn't matter.
[1:47:35] But if he was with family, he would
[1:47:37] dress a little nicer. Maybe not a tie,
[1:47:38] but you know, nicer. And the the Bible
[1:47:42] was always the last thing into the
[1:47:44] suitcase because you don't put anything
[1:47:46] on top of your Bible.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; And if you listen close enough, he tells
[1:47:50] you, "Not even my books." So, I better
[1:47:53] not see anything on top of your Bible.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Anyway, those are his rules. So, I
[1:47:59] wasn't going to get up at 5 in the
[1:48:01] morning, say goodbye. I went the night
[1:48:03] of the 17th to um you know to say
[1:48:06] goodbye to him
[1:48:08] and so we're in the bedroom by ourselves
[1:48:11] and we're talking and I noticed on the
[1:48:13] chair by the door was his boots and his
[1:48:15] blue jeans and and such was his rules,
[1:48:18] you know. I said, "Well, what's this all
[1:48:19] about?" He said, "Well, a guy never
[1:48:21] knows when he might have car trouble."
[1:48:24] Well, I knew this guy never had car
[1:48:26] trouble, but I never said a word. He
[1:48:29] didn't say a word, but within 24 hours
[1:48:31] he'd been in a head-on collision, almost
[1:48:33] died. And
[1:48:36] um that was on the night of the 18th of
[1:48:40] December.
[1:48:42] And so we made it over to the hospital
[1:48:45] in Amarillo by Sunday, the next day. And
[1:48:49] people started to gather. Remember, no
[1:48:51] cell phones, only a phone on the wall.
[1:48:53] You got to put coins in it. Didn't take
[1:48:54] credit card. And so people are starting
[1:48:57] to arrive. They want to know. They want
[1:49:00] to investigate. Well, he's back there in
[1:49:02] ICU where there's 12 beds. He's all
[1:49:05] wrapped up. Can't talk, can't see, has a
[1:49:08] trachea.
[1:49:10] And I got in to see him once during
[1:49:12] those few days just to pray and and you
[1:49:15] know because you got 10 minutes. Well,
[1:49:17] in the waiting room there was a lot of
[1:49:19] people, a lot of opinions.
[1:49:22] Some sounded better than others, but um
[1:49:26] over here to the side was a Mexican
[1:49:28] family. And I go over there and start
[1:49:30] talking to them. Well, it turns out that
[1:49:33] in the head-on collision in the other
[1:49:35] car were four Mexican brothers, men,
[1:49:38] probably not related. One died on the
[1:49:40] scene and the other three were in the
[1:49:42] hospital. And this was the parents of
[1:49:43] one of the boys. Okay. And so we talked
[1:49:46] a little bit. I don't know what we said,
[1:49:49] but years later, come to find out they u
[1:49:53] they'd been telling people, "Yeah, our
[1:49:55] son, you know, he he was in the
[1:49:57] hospital. We we talked to brother M's
[1:49:58] son-in-law." Well, that boy eventually
[1:50:01] became a Pentecostal preacher and his
[1:50:04] son is also a preacher. I've only heard
[1:50:07] about him. I've not got to meet him yet,
[1:50:09] but um the boy himself that was in the
[1:50:11] wreck, he's already passed on. uh you
[1:50:14] never know
[1:50:16] when you see and talk to people where
[1:50:18] it's going to produce, you know,
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; and so God knows the he knows the score.
[1:50:24] He knows who's who. He's got the right
[1:50:25] people at the right place. And so during
[1:50:28] these days, you know, there's a lot of
[1:50:29] confusion going on. And um
[1:50:34] uh finally during those six days of
[1:50:37] brother Rams in the hospital, the other
[1:50:38] 11 beds in ICU improved, went home. But
[1:50:43] on the night of the 24th of December,
[1:50:45] the Lord said, "That's enough. Took him
[1:50:47] home." We weren't planning on that. That
[1:50:49] wasn't part of the idea anybody had. You
[1:50:52] know, even though when you look back, he
[1:50:54] makes little hints here and there about
[1:50:55] leaving, but you know, we hadn't caught
[1:50:58] that because see, back then there was no
[1:51:00] cassette tapes. There was no It was
[1:51:02] reals. It took It took some effort to
[1:51:04] put the tape on, listen to it, and all
[1:51:07] uh it wasn't like it is today. You see
[1:51:09] today everything brother Ram said is on
[1:51:11] every cell phone on the planet in more
[1:51:14] than one language. So there's no excuse.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; But um so or took him and the next day
[1:51:22] we arranged to have um they arranged for
[1:51:26] a couple of ambulance planes where you
[1:51:29] put you know a bed in each one and we
[1:51:32] flew back to Jeffersonville. I had to
[1:51:35] get back to service because I wasn't a
[1:51:36] blood relative. couldn't stay for the
[1:51:37] funeral. But the fact is that they had
[1:51:40] the they had a funeral, but the family
[1:51:43] couldn't decide where they should bury
[1:51:44] him. Should it be here in Jeffersonville
[1:51:46] or over here in Tucson where the new
[1:51:48] house is? So, the funeral director said,
[1:51:50] "Don't worry. I got a place to I can
[1:51:52] keep him." And uh you all
[1:51:56] um when you decide, let me know. And so,
[1:52:01] um, we were like the the disciples, you
[1:52:04] know, when the Lord left. What do we do
[1:52:06] now? We were on this trajectory. Now
[1:52:08] he's gone. And but God has a plan.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; You see, most of the people, cuz I was
[1:52:14] there, most of the people were just
[1:52:15] watching for the miracles. Okay, how
[1:52:17] many miracles do you need? You know,
[1:52:19] weren't listening to what he said. And
[1:52:21] so now, oh, start listening to what he
[1:52:23] said. And of course, the printing
[1:52:25] started up and everything. In the
[1:52:26] meantime, I'm back in Louisiana in uh in
[1:52:31] school, learning how to cook for
[1:52:33] hundreds of people. And uh Rebecca's
[1:52:36] learning how to take care of her mother
[1:52:37] and her brother and sister.
[1:52:40] And you know, when I wanted to call, I
[1:52:43] had to stand in a long line because like
[1:52:44] there'd be 10 phones on the wall and 10
[1:52:46] lines. People want to use the phone. It
[1:52:49] wasn't like it is today. Well, finally
[1:52:51] we get to March of ' 66 and um
[1:52:56] and I knew what God had done for me. I
[1:52:58] knew God had done something for Rebecca
[1:53:00] and I knew I was leaving, you know, in
[1:53:03] April. So, I said, um, let's get married
[1:53:05] next Wednesday, March the 30th, 1966.
[1:53:09] So, we had a private wedding at the
[1:53:11] house, just our family, and we took off
[1:53:13] on a honeymoon to Indiana. And so, um,
[1:53:18] uh, we knew that by then they decided,
[1:53:20] okay, we're going to have a burial in
[1:53:21] Indiana. So, we we drive back there and,
[1:53:27] uh, Monday, April the 11th was a was a
[1:53:29] just a gentle rainy day. Just wouldn't
[1:53:32] go away. And so, we're gathering for the
[1:53:36] burial.
[1:53:37] And Billy Paul had always kept contact
[1:53:41] with his grandmother. That's Hope's
[1:53:43] mother. and she was a very difficult
[1:53:45] person. Never expressed too much, never
[1:53:48] went to church. So on the way to the
[1:53:51] burial, he leaves his two little boys,
[1:53:53] like three and two or whatever they
[1:53:55] were, very young with grandma. Goes to
[1:53:58] the burial, comes back and for the first
[1:54:01] time in his life, he sees grandma wiping
[1:54:05] her eyes.
[1:54:07] And she said, you know, even the heavens
[1:54:09] weep for that man.
[1:54:12] So that was that was what happened on
[1:54:15] that Monday. We flew off to California
[1:54:20] and on the 15th of April I flew off to
[1:54:22] Vietnam for one year. Yeah. I was one of
[1:54:26] the survivors. I wasn't one of the
[1:54:27] 52,000 died. And so um here I am working
[1:54:32] in a like a field hospital
[1:54:34] um for a year but we're watching the
[1:54:37] calendar you know and there was no
[1:54:39] FaceTime. There was no vacation. No,
[1:54:41] nothing, no phone, only letters. They're
[1:54:43] written two weeks ago. So, that was a
[1:54:46] trial by fire, but God's watching over
[1:54:49] him.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Watching what's going on. And um so I
[1:54:52] get back, finished off my two-year
[1:54:55] commitment, and in October of ' 67, I
[1:55:00] started working with the printing of the
[1:55:01] message in Spanish, which some other
[1:55:04] people had tried and they' left off a
[1:55:06] paragraph and there was some problems.
[1:55:07] So, I basically had to start from
[1:55:09] scratch. And that's where we started and
[1:55:11] started, you know, getting it right
[1:55:13] because see like right here, we listen
[1:55:15] to an English tape. Those of you that
[1:55:17] understand English, we listen to an
[1:55:19] English tape and we feel the the
[1:55:21] anointing. We we we have a certain thing
[1:55:23] it produces in us. Well, it's only
[1:55:27] logical that these people over here in
[1:55:29] Spanish or French or whatever should
[1:55:31] feel something similar when they hear
[1:55:33] it.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; You know, we can't it's there's no such
[1:55:36] thing as word for word. Look, look in
[1:55:38] your Bible in Luke and Jesus said, which
[1:55:41] means
[1:55:43] well, it's a lot fewer words for one
[1:55:44] thing. So, it's not word for word. It's
[1:55:46] it's the expression of what's being
[1:55:48] said.
[1:55:50] Just like you saw the two translators up
[1:55:52] here, two people up here just now. He
[1:55:54] wasn't saying every word. He said this
[1:55:56] is what he said. You know, so that's
[1:55:58] what we've tried to do is to get the
[1:56:00] message into Spanish to where they can
[1:56:03] be anointed with the same spirit as the
[1:56:06] English. You see, obviously we were use
[1:56:08] all the words we can, but see, um, like
[1:56:12] brother Random, I think I can find it on
[1:56:14] tape, but there's a saying in English,
[1:56:17] uh, I was tickled to death. Well, we all
[1:56:20] understand what that means. We don't
[1:56:22] need an explanation, but if you're going
[1:56:24] to translate word for word, oh well, he
[1:56:26] scratched himself till he died.
[1:56:30] I mean, it's silly, but that's what you
[1:56:32] get, you know. And we have a and brother
[1:56:35] has a lot of American sayings. They're
[1:56:37] not even in the dictionary.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; You have to know his There's some things
[1:56:41] I never even knew what he meant till I
[1:56:43] got back to Indiana and talked to some
[1:56:44] other people. You know, when he says, "I
[1:56:47] pack the water." Well, you pack a
[1:56:49] suitcase. What do you mean pack the
[1:56:51] water? What? You carry the water? Uh, in
[1:56:56] English, he says, "Uh, the oddball."
[1:56:59] Well, we kind of know what that means.
[1:57:00] What's wrong with the ball?
[1:57:03] So we use odd bird. Oh, perfectly
[1:57:06] understood. So anyway, I translated a
[1:57:10] small track which is a brief u portion
[1:57:13] of his um his life story. He ascended on
[1:57:18] high and gave gifts unto men. I
[1:57:19] translated that when I was still in high
[1:57:20] school. He liked that. Well, anyway,
[1:57:22] while he was building the house, while
[1:57:24] they're finishing up the house, um the
[1:57:26] dinner room's up, you know, just getting
[1:57:28] up and he's getting the animals and all
[1:57:30] that. So he knew I was bilingual. So he
[1:57:33] asked me one day. He says, "Now, how do
[1:57:36] how can I say uh eagle's nest in
[1:57:38] Spanish?" So I rattled it off. Oh, I
[1:57:41] can't say that. So you have to write it
[1:57:42] down. So I wrote it out for him. Years
[1:57:45] later, I come to see puts it on the door
[1:57:46] of the dinner room.
[1:57:49] You know, that's where that came from.
[1:57:51] Well, um,
[1:57:54] so the the message is getting the
[1:57:57] Spanish, getting some other languages.
[1:57:59] So that takes a lot of years. So we're
[1:58:01] going to fast forward to 2002. Okay. By
[1:58:04] this time, we're living in Tennessee and
[1:58:07] Rebecca was feeling very bad. She had
[1:58:09] some kind of pain. She didn't know what
[1:58:11] it was. She couldn't touch it and no
[1:58:14] doctor would look at her. Wouldn't give
[1:58:16] her the time of day. Finally, she found
[1:58:17] a doctor that would, you know, take care
[1:58:19] of her. Well, she had a large tumor on
[1:58:21] the kidney. And um so in 2002, that was
[1:58:26] operated on. Of course they they watch
[1:58:27] you after that you know see where else
[1:58:29] it could develop and it it came up in
[1:58:32] the lungs and so by 2006 uh she had been
[1:58:36] to many hospitals and we were out here
[1:58:39] in Tucson
[1:58:41] and so um you know this wasn't just
[1:58:44] anybody this is somebody lived with
[1:58:46] William Rener for 19 years she knew more
[1:58:48] about faith and miracles than I knew and
[1:58:51] um so uh we're believing we're see these
[1:58:57] things declining every day, you know,
[1:59:00] and so there's all kinds of people
[1:59:02] praying,
[1:59:04] people in other countries. So when he
[1:59:06] lack of faith, when he lack of of
[1:59:08] prayer, but um one day in October of '
[1:59:14] 06, a little sister called us from back
[1:59:16] in West Virginia, a friend of the
[1:59:18] family, and she said, "Now, I was
[1:59:20] getting up from the table today at noon,
[1:59:23] and there's a vision right there." He
[1:59:26] said, "I can see brother Random. I see
[1:59:28] all these people. Saw the prayer line.
[1:59:30] He's preaching faith." And then he says,
[1:59:32] "And you little sister, thank you for
[1:59:34] praying for my daughter Rebecca. Tell
[1:59:37] George everything will be okay."
[1:59:39] Well, might not be the way I want it,
[1:59:41] but it's going to be okay. No problem.
[1:59:46] And so on November the 28th, which is
[1:59:49] just like two days ago, 19 years ago,
[1:59:51] the Lord took her. And after that, I
[1:59:54] remember praying, Lord, keep me focused
[1:59:57] and balanced and busy. So, I've been
[2:00:00] very busy and uh we're trying to stay
[2:00:03] balanced, but focused on the
[2:00:05] resurrection.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; See, that's the next thing.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Now, it's a lot easier today to believe
[2:00:12] what Brother says, it's only going to be
[2:00:13] a few than it was 50 years ago. Oh, all
[2:00:16] these believers and all these books.
[2:00:18] Well, I'm not so sure anymore.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; We got a lot of opinions. A lot of stuff
[2:00:23] doesn't match anything in the Bible.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; What do you expect?
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Well,
[2:00:30] we were married just over 40 years. We
[2:00:32] have three children. One lives in
[2:00:34] Tucson, two live in Tennessee. We got
[2:00:38] three grandchildren,
[2:00:39] and one great granddaughter.
[2:00:43] Yeah.
[2:00:44] So, we just had some pictures with the
[2:00:46] four generations. But you know your
[2:00:49] neighbors and the people at the gas
[2:00:51] station, the people, grocery store,
[2:00:54] they're watching your life.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Now, we don't we don't dress just to be
[2:00:59] seen.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; You ladies are dressed a certain way
[2:01:02] because that's the way you're taught and
[2:01:04] you know it's right. And so,
[2:01:07] um,
[2:01:09] Jesus said, "By this shall all those
[2:01:12] people know that you're my disciples
[2:01:15] because you're carrying the Bible." No.
[2:01:17] All people in Phoenix care
[2:01:19] because you got a nice belt block all
[2:01:20] hole. No, because you carry the
[2:01:22] prophet's picture. No. Love one to the
[2:01:26] other.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; And that's what I see here.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; We got people from every place. I mean,
[2:01:31] Saskatoon of all places and all kinds of
[2:01:33] people that are gathered because we love
[2:01:36] each other.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; We love the word, you know.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; And so a lot of times I um
[2:01:44] I'm questioned about things. I don't run
[2:01:46] away run away from any questions. I was
[2:01:48] in Congo more than once and I was in
[2:01:50] this one church and there's at least
[2:01:53] 5,000 people there and there's no
[2:01:56] drywall. It's all concrete, you know.
[2:01:58] So, I'm speaking with the translator
[2:02:00] into the other language. So, as soon as
[2:02:03] we get done, well, first of all, when
[2:02:05] you're speaking to this crowd,
[2:02:07] u you don't tell them now, let's turn
[2:02:10] over to First John. I notice there's no
[2:02:12] Bibles. Well, I'm thinking, well, it's
[2:02:15] Africa, poor people. So, I give the
[2:02:17] pastor and I, you know, we want to help.
[2:02:19] We don't need help. We have money. We
[2:02:22] built this church with our money, no
[2:02:23] dollars. He said, "The problem is they
[2:02:26] sell Bibles right there. But the problem
[2:02:28] is these people can't read." Why?
[2:02:32] Because this is a diamond area.
[2:02:35] You can't just drive over there. You got
[2:02:37] to fly in only with an invitation sealed
[2:02:40] and all that.
[2:02:41] So when kids are five and six and eight
[2:02:43] years old, they're out there digging for
[2:02:45] diamonds. A lot of them can't read. They
[2:02:47] don't need books. They don't need, you
[2:02:49] know, uh, Bibles.
[2:02:52] They need a preacher.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; They need they they got to hear it
[2:02:55] firsthand. So that was kind of the what
[2:02:57] was into. And so this brother, the
[2:03:01] pastor jumps up. He said, "We don't know
[2:03:03] when, brother George is coming back.
[2:03:05] Would there be any questions?"
[2:03:08] Yeah. 5,000 black people and me.
[2:03:11] And so they look at me and well they
[2:03:13] start writing out the questions, you
[2:03:14] know, come up and they got to translate
[2:03:16] the question. They got to translate the
[2:03:17] answer. Well, this goes on and on.
[2:03:20] They're not hungry.
[2:03:22] Here's 5,000 people and outside there's
[2:03:24] 10 cars and there's probably uh 200
[2:03:28] motorcycles and about 500 bicycles.
[2:03:30] Everybody else walked. So they're not
[2:03:32] going to be correct. Well, the only
[2:03:34] question I remember
[2:03:36] the sister sent up a question. Well,
[2:03:38] since the Lord took your wife, why you
[2:03:40] still wearing the ring?
[2:03:42] Wow. People notice everything.
[2:03:46] I said, ' Because my commitment to
[2:03:47] Rebecca wasn't until death do you part.
[2:03:49] It's for eternity.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, I hadn't even
[2:03:54] thought of that before that, you know,
[2:03:55] but it's just it's true. Well, um what
[2:04:00] are we doing today? Well, we're
[2:04:01] traveling like places like this to be an
[2:04:04] encouragement to people. People have the
[2:04:06] entire message. I guarantee you Ron
[2:04:09] Peterson's got four different versions.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; A lot of people have, you know, all
[2:04:13] kinds of message books. And that's good.
[2:04:16] We can go see what he said. But we need
[2:04:19] to be encouraged to get into the book to
[2:04:22] listen closely,
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; you know. So that's part of my job.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Listen, get ready because this thing's
[2:04:29] about over, you know.
[2:04:31] And um
[2:04:33] so we're we're printing books in China.
[2:04:37] We printed thousands of of Church's
[2:04:40] books and seal books in China at a very
[2:04:42] good price delivered and so forth. But
[2:04:45] finally one of the Chinese people got to
[2:04:47] reading what it says and there's I don't
[2:04:50] know where it's at but some negative
[2:04:51] comment about communism. Forget this. So
[2:04:54] now we're printing in India
[2:04:57] and um so we're printing in Ecuador,
[2:05:00] Mexico, different places because people
[2:05:03] want a book they can underline. They
[2:05:05] want to they want to turn the pages, you
[2:05:06] know, and so we're very busy also with
[2:05:09] with humanitarian aid. If you know
[2:05:11] anything about the news, the US is going
[2:05:14] to march into Venezuela maybe today or
[2:05:16] tomorrow. They're going to try to cut
[2:05:18] off the drug trade. But guess what?
[2:05:21] There's too many of your friends and
[2:05:22] relatives that are buying the drugs.
[2:05:24] They'll give anything for those drugs.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; So, it's never going to stop. But things
[2:05:30] are going to come to a head real quick.
[2:05:32] And we'll see what happens then. But
[2:05:34] there's a lot of people in Venezuela are
[2:05:35] trying to help with $100 here, $100
[2:05:38] there, just so they can buy some
[2:05:39] groceries just to make it, you know.
[2:05:42] Well, um,
[2:05:45] one last thing.
[2:05:47] I got a friend that God deals with him
[2:05:49] in dreams. And God deals in dreams. He
[2:05:52] gives some people dreams. He doesn't
[2:05:53] give me any dreams. And so he was this
[2:05:56] dream. He was in brother Rand's living
[2:05:59] room in Jeffersonville.
[2:06:01] And um
[2:06:04] Rebecca and I were sitting over by the
[2:06:06] fireplace and here's brother Neville and
[2:06:09] Sister Brandhammer sitting in the chairs
[2:06:11] talking and he's looking at it like a
[2:06:13] fly on the wall, you know. And so um
[2:06:16] directly brother Neville gets up to
[2:06:17] leave. He goes towards the door. Well
[2:06:20] the Lord took him in March of 1974.
[2:06:25] And so then Sister Brandon gets up to
[2:06:28] leave to see him out. And the Lord took
[2:06:30] her in May of 1981.
[2:06:33] And so then they're over here in this
[2:06:35] other dimension. And they said to
[2:06:36] Rebecca, here come over here with us. So
[2:06:38] she comes over there with them. That was
[2:06:41] November of ' 06.
[2:06:43] And um so they look back at me, all
[2:06:46] three of them, you keep doing what
[2:06:48] you're doing.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; So that's why I'm here today.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; May God bless you.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't need to leave that here.
[2:07:05] You guys are okay.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Are we okay? Was it
[2:07:09] we check out
[2:07:11] now? Now, we have a time of questions
[2:07:12] and answers. So,
[2:07:17] you know, I wanted Brother George to get
[2:07:19] up. He's he's part of the he was married
[2:07:21] into the family, but he's he saw he's
[2:07:25] been in the meetings and he gave you a
[2:07:28] firsthand
[2:07:31] viewpoint
[2:07:32] of what it was like.
[2:07:35] And you know, a lot of times you think,
[2:07:37] well, you know, if you were around him
[2:07:38] and the first time he met Brother
[2:07:40] Brandon, Brother Brandon's got his shirt
[2:07:42] off. He's working in the backyard and
[2:07:43] everything. And uh you know, uh what
[2:07:47] I've always enjoyed about Brother George
[2:07:49] is I use the word he's down home.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; He's no pretense. He's no flashing the
[2:07:57] the billboard or anything like that.
[2:07:59] He's just down home. And I've always
[2:08:02] appreciated that. and I've always found
[2:08:04] him. He and I have had some very very
[2:08:07] personal
[2:08:09] um discussions and times together.
[2:08:13] And I said, "Brother George," I said,
[2:08:16] "of all of the family that I am personal
[2:08:20] witness to," I says, "I appreciate your
[2:08:23] balance."
[2:08:25] And we've had that connection ever
[2:08:27] since. And uh uh so, Brother George has
[2:08:34] been around. He's
[2:08:37] been to many places. He's been in the
[2:08:39] meetings of brother Brennham and there
[2:08:41] are very few of them that are actually
[2:08:43] left.
[2:08:44] And um so uh I wanted him today and I
[2:08:49] had three witnesses in this church say,
[2:08:52] "Brother Ron, would you just have him
[2:08:54] just give his testimony, a little bit of
[2:08:56] the background? Let us fill in. Oh, we
[2:08:59] know he married Rebecca and everything.
[2:09:01] How did it come to pass? How what was it
[2:09:03] like uh when you met Brother Brennham
[2:09:07] and and different things and and so was
[2:09:10] that a blessing to you today to just
[2:09:12] hear firsthand? Yeah. Give me my hand.
[2:09:22] And uh so uh
[2:09:26] we're just staying here, keeping on
[2:09:30] trying to keep our balance
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; in the midst of all of the ones that go
[2:09:36] on this side and want to go. God, keep
[2:09:38] us in the middle
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; of the road.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless all of you. Let's stand
[2:09:45] together this morning.
[2:09:47] Amen.
[2:09:49] I want to say thank you to all of our
[2:09:51] friends and visitors that have come here
[2:09:53] to be with us today. God richly bless
[2:09:56] you. Um
[2:09:59] and uh I covet your prayers for me
[2:10:02] tomorrow, Lord willing, by let's say
[2:10:05] 8:30 I should be in recovery and out and
[2:10:08] everything. What I will probably do is
[2:10:11] Sandy will text it to the board and then
[2:10:15] the board will give it to somebody to
[2:10:17] Sister Linda or somebody and get let you
[2:10:19] guys know uh that brother Ron's okay and
[2:10:22] everything. And somebody asked me
[2:10:24] yesterday, are you are are you uh you
[2:10:27] know real nervous? And no, no. Hey, I
[2:10:29] you know I'm anxious. I want to get it
[2:10:32] done. So that's the only thing. Hey uh
[2:10:34] you know we get older
[2:10:37] and parts wear out. Some of you have got
[2:10:39] new shoulders and hips and and knees and
[2:10:43] eyes and teeth and different things. Uh,
[2:10:46] you know, it just happens. You get
[2:10:48] older. The Bible says that if this body
[2:10:51] be dissolved, we have another one. I'm
[2:10:53] thankful that I have another one. Okay,
[2:10:56] this one is wearing out, but I believe
[2:10:58] soon and very soon that I'm going to get
[2:11:01] that heavenly body
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; and be in that other dimension. How will
[2:11:07] it happen? I don't know. One thing about
[2:11:10] that seventh seal, he didn't say uh of
[2:11:13] how it would happen and when it would
[2:11:15] happen. He said just make sure that
[2:11:17] you're a part of the happening. And I
[2:11:19] believe saints of God and just to let
[2:11:21] you know as brother George was talking
[2:11:23] about that prophetic insight. The more
[2:11:26] that I look into this message
[2:11:30] and the more that I am a personal
[2:11:33] witness of it, the more I am absolutely
[2:11:36] convinced
[2:11:38] it is supernatural.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; And he said, if you'll just get the
[2:11:47] people to believe,
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; how many of you say I believe?
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:55] Let's sing Only Believe once again as
[2:11:57] we're going to dismiss. And I I'm going
[2:12:00] to have Brother George, he many of you
[2:12:02] maybe have not met him before and shook
[2:12:05] his hand. Um, and Brother Robert, if you
[2:12:09] would, if you take and get Brother
[2:12:11] George uh situated and if he needs to
[2:12:15] leave his stuff in my office, that's
[2:12:16] fine. But be able to shake your hand and
[2:12:19] say hello to you. Amen. Yes. only
[2:12:25] be
[2:12:30] only
[2:12:36] all things are possible.
[2:12:42] Only
[2:12:45] believe
[2:12:47] and only
[2:12:50] believe.
[2:12:52] Only
[2:12:56] believe
[2:13:00] for all things are possible.
[2:13:06] Only
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; now we make it personal. Lord I believe
[2:13:12] and Lord
[2:13:14] I believe.
[2:13:18] Lord,
[2:13:20] I believe.
[2:13:24] All things are possible.
[2:13:30] Lord, I
[2:13:33] believe.
[2:13:36] Lord,
[2:13:38] I believe.
[2:13:41] And Lord,
[2:13:44] I believe.
[2:13:48] All things are possible
[2:13:53] Lord I.
[2:13:57] Amen. God bless you. Thank you. Turn
[2:13:59] around. Greet somebody. Say God bless
[2:14:01] you. Consider yourselves dismissed. You
[2:14:04] may go
[2:14:06] in the name of the Lord.
[2:14:23] Oh
[2:14:25] baby.
[2:14:29] Oh,
[2:14:40] holy.
[2:14:45] Yes. Holy.
[2:14:58] All things
[2:15:00] are
[2:15:15] all
[2:16:37] What
[2:17:05] do you
[2:17:27] I feel you.
[2:18:27] Heat. Heat.
