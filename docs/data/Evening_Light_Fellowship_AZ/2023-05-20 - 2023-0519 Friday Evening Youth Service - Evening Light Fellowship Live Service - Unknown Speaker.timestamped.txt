[23:24] to Worship the Lord is one of the
[23:26] greatest privileges we can have
[23:31] the Angels were created for worship
[23:34] we were created for Fellowship but we
[23:37] love to worship
[23:41] deep within our beings is a desire just
[23:44] to lift up and magnify the Lord
[23:48] he's worthy of it
[23:50] he is worthy of our worship he's worthy
[23:53] of our service of our Adoration of all

[24:01] our heads in the word of Prayer
[24:04] Heavenly Father we love you
[24:07] we're so thankful for your spirit and
[24:09] your presence that's here according to a
[24:11] Divine promise
[24:13] that where two or three would be
[24:15] gathered together you would be in their
[24:17] midst
[24:18] and we recognize your presence here Lord
[24:21] we want to entertain your presence Lord
[24:23] we want to make you feel welcome Lord we
[24:26] don't want you to be off in a corner
[24:27] with dirty feet and and not welcome Lord
[24:30] we want to open up our hearts and we
[24:32] just want to welcome you here Lord and
[24:34] we want to worship you
[24:37] Lord I just asked tonight that you would
[24:39] open up the word of God to our hearts I
[24:42] pray that you would encourage and
[24:43] strengthen the young people here Lord
[24:46] father may they leave this place knowing
[24:49] you in a greater way Lord
[24:51] walking with you a little bit closer
[24:54] Lord
[24:56] father I pray that you would just have
[24:58] your way in this service now
[25:00] pray that this vessel would be yielded
[25:03] in your hands
[25:04] may you be glorified
[25:07] Jesus Christ's name
[25:09] amen
[25:11] God bless you tonight good to be here
[25:14] and
[25:15] to see all these faces here and to
[25:17] recognize a few of them I'm I'm
[25:19] struggling with names enormously but I
[25:23] love you just the same
[25:25] and if you have your Bibles let's open
[25:27] up to the Book of Proverbs
[25:29] we'll begin there
[25:31] appreciate the
[25:33] the invitation and the
[25:36] the privilege to minister to the young
[25:38] people here
[25:39] and
[25:40] you know there's
[25:42] there's nothing good in any man
[25:45] there's nothing I have
[25:47] that I can give you that you need
[25:50] but there is something that I have that
[25:52] I can't give you that you need and
[25:55] that's my Lord Jesus
[25:57] but I'm believing that by a Divine gift
[26:00] tonight we can go into the word of God
[26:02] and your heart can reach out and take a
[26:05] hold of what God has for you
[26:08] Proverbs the third chapter the fifth
[26:10] verse
[26:12] says trust in the Lord with all thine
[26:16] heart and lean not unto thine own
[26:19] understanding
[26:21] in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He
[26:25] Shall direct thy paths I want to read
[26:28] that together verse 5 it's going to be a
[26:31] bit of a theme tonight but together
[26:33] aloud trust in the Lord with all thine
[26:36] heart and lean not unto thine own
[26:40] understanding
[26:43] you may be seated tonight
[26:46] in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He
[26:49] Shall direct thy paths now as young
[26:53] people and facts are as older people
[26:55] lots of times you're just not sure which
[26:57] way to go you're not sure which path to
[26:59] take which direction to turn
[27:02] and that's because you've never done
[27:04] this before
[27:05] this is your first go-around and you
[27:08] need somebody a whole lot smarter a
[27:10] whole lot wiser
[27:12] and that's God
[27:15] and he said that he would direct your
[27:17] paths
[27:18] but it said acknowledge Him in all thy
[27:22] ways and that word acknowledgment is is
[27:24] just beautiful it speaks of a an
[27:26] acceptance or an admitting
[27:30] of the existence or the truth of
[27:32] something there's an acknowledgment it's
[27:35] uh in a way you could you know this
[27:37] person standing here I acknowledge that
[27:40] uh Austin's sitting here I acknowledge
[27:42] it I recognize it I say ah yes Austin
[27:44] and you know oftentimes when you're
[27:46] walking by and you see somebody you know
[27:47] you just kind of Nod your head like hey
[27:48] I see you there it's a knowledge
[27:50] acknowledgment
[27:52] in everything you do say yes Lord
[27:55] I see you're there yes Lord I recognize
[27:58] your presence here I acknowledge you I
[28:00] recognize who you are now direct my
[28:04] paths
[28:06] in all your ways acknowledge Him and He
[28:08] will direct your paths
[28:11] that's a whole uh a whole sermon we can
[28:14] go right on there but I want to focus on
[28:16] leaning not to your own understanding
[28:19] and for a text I want to take an eternal
[28:23] Foundation
[28:24] and right here uh I want to read a quote
[28:28] Bram says in the sermon uh trying to do
[28:31] go out of service without it being his
[28:32] will
[28:33] he says may our hearts continually be
[28:36] set on thee and we know Lord that money
[28:39] and property and things of the world
[28:40] have no meaning just so temporal all of
[28:44] them must go our jobs our places our
[28:48] friends everything must go no matter how
[28:51] rich how poor how popular or unpopular
[28:53] we are it all must go but there is only
[28:56] one thing that our being here is
[28:59] centered around and that's Jesus Christ
[29:02] so right there is the center of your
[29:04] life that's the center of everything to
[29:06] you is Jesus Christ so God let us lay
[29:09] aside everything as secondarily and hold
[29:13] to him
[29:15] and he is the word Granite Lord the
[29:21] Vindicated word of the hour
[29:24] what is that
[29:25] this message the Vindicated word of the
[29:29] days of Moses was Jesus
[29:33] the Vindicated word of the days of
[29:35] Isaiah Elijah John all was Jesus and the
[29:39] Vindicated word today is Jesus the same
[29:43] yesterday today and forever help us Lord
[29:46] to believe that see that and walk in it
[29:51] we ask in Jesus name
[29:54] oh if you can get a picture of what the
[29:57] center post is it's Jesus Christ and
[30:00] it's Jesus Christ as he has been
[30:01] revealed to us through the message of
[30:03] this hour not the message of Noah's day
[30:05] in Noah's day there was a message and it
[30:08] was Jesus Christ the Ark of Safety but
[30:11] please don't go build a boat right now
[30:13] that's not the message for right now
[30:15] you've got to recognize where Jesus
[30:18] Christ is right now and you must Center
[30:20] your life on that
[30:23] and Jesus Christ is the word the message
[30:26] of this hour
[30:29] now in Matthew the seventh chapter I'd
[30:31] like to to uh turn if you'll open up
[30:35] your Bibles there
[30:37] Matthew the seventh chapter seventh
[30:40] chapter and verse 24.
[30:44] and uh
[30:45] this is some a verse that
[30:48] everyone here is familiar with
[30:53] says therefore whosoever heareth these
[30:56] sayings of mine
[30:58] and do with them that's a very important
[31:01] and
[31:02] and do with them I will liken him unto a
[31:05] wise man which built his house upon a
[31:07] rock and the rain descended and the
[31:09] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[31:11] upon that house and it fell not for it
[31:15] was founded upon Iraq
[31:18] and everyone that heareth these sayings
[31:20] of mine and do with them not shall be
[31:22] likened unto a foolish man which built
[31:24] his house upon the sand and the rain
[31:26] descended and the floods came and the
[31:28] winds blew and beat upon that house and
[31:30] it fell and great was the fall of it
[31:35] now
[31:37] this is the the common little Sunday
[31:39] school song We Sing uh maybe you don't
[31:42] sing it anymore but the wise man built
[31:44] his house upon the rock you know it's
[31:46] kind of a little simple song We Sing
[31:48] we're all familiar with it but right
[31:50] there if you can catch the revelation of
[31:52] that right there your life will be
[31:55] completely different if you will build
[31:57] your life upon that rock upon that solid
[32:01] foundation of the word of God he says
[32:03] basically what Jesus is saying here is
[32:05] whoever hears me and obeys my word his
[32:09] life will be solid it'll be built upon a
[32:14] rock
[32:16] says in the oncoming storm
[32:18] he says Jesus was speaking here he reads
[32:21] this text in his sermon speaking here of
[32:22] a coming storm which has got to strike
[32:25] every man and every woman that's born in
[32:28] the world how many have been born in the
[32:30] world here
[32:32] what about you
[32:33] okay just checking everyone even that's
[32:36] been born in the world you all qualify
[32:38] if you're here breathing
[32:39] you qualify so here's an update for you
[32:42] a storm's coming your way
[32:44] every man and every woman that's born in
[32:47] this world there is just no way out of
[32:49] it that storm will strike you sometime
[32:52] or other and depends on what kind of
[32:55] foundation that you have whether your
[32:57] house will weather it or not
[33:00] there has been many lives saved because
[33:03] of preparation for storms
[33:06] and there's been many alive lost because
[33:08] of failing to take heed to the warning
[33:10] of storms that's coming
[33:13] now
[33:15] you may or may not feel like storms are
[33:18] something you really need to worry about
[33:19] you might feel like life's going good
[33:21] you might feel like life's going bad I
[33:23] really don't care what exact stage of
[33:25] that you're in I can tell you whether
[33:27] you realize you're in a storm or whether
[33:29] you don't see a storm there's a storm
[33:31] coming
[33:32] it's gonna happen
[33:34] and you need to be prepared and ready
[33:36] when that storm comes
[33:39] and it's a matter of life
[33:41] and death
[33:44] so
[33:45] what's your life built on
[33:48] what is your foundation
[33:51] what are you building your life on
[33:53] and as young people you've got plans
[33:57] you've got Ambitions uh I mean some of
[34:01] us probably still don't know what we
[34:02] want to be when we grow up but some of
[34:04] us probably have an idea I know my Dad
[34:06] still hasn't figured out what he wants
[34:08] to be when he grows up but at least
[34:10] that's what I heard him saying
[34:12] um but for some of you you have a plan
[34:14] you say this is what I'm going to do
[34:15] this is where I'm going you've got a
[34:16] direction you've got an ambition and
[34:19] that's good
[34:20] purpose is an important thing you should
[34:22] have a purpose
[34:24] but
[34:26] your foundation
[34:28] the foundation of it all must be solid
[34:33] and that stability is not going to come
[34:36] out in this world it's not there
[34:39] and the other place it's not going to
[34:41] come from is your own mind
[34:44] lean not to your own understanding
[34:47] don't do it do not trust in your own
[34:51] mind to guide you but acknowledge Him
[34:53] turn to him trust in the Lord
[34:56] don't lean to your own understanding
[34:59] here programs talking about uh
[35:03] this foundation and if you have a
[35:05] foundation problem there's something you
[35:07] should do if you have a foundation
[35:08] problem and that's not you know repaint
[35:11] the house
[35:13] um he says now don't build upon that
[35:15] alone that intellectual Faith he's
[35:17] talking about how intellectual faith is
[35:18] it's a good thing to a point like you
[35:21] need to at least believe the word of God
[35:22] with your mind that's a great starting
[35:24] point like Okay I accept that that's the
[35:26] word of God that's a good starting place
[35:28] but he says that's not enough alone and
[35:30] he goes on here he says brother wood and
[35:31] he says somewhere in the building as a
[35:33] contractor he says well what good would
[35:36] it do for him to take on a building
[35:38] that's worm eaten the termites has eaten
[35:41] the building down and it's rotten to the
[35:43] foundation and he goes out and he gets
[35:45] some of the best Lumber that he could
[35:46] find good dry seasoned Redwood tack it
[35:49] on the home go out here and get paint
[35:51] that's just recommended by the highest
[35:53] paint country contractor in the company
[35:55] in the world see look here preacher I
[35:57] can show you that this is real genuine
[35:59] Redwood I'd say yes brother wood that's
[36:02] right look here it's real seal of
[36:04] approval that this is the best paint
[36:06] that could be put on a house
[36:08] that's right brother wood but your
[36:10] foundation is wrong it's got to come
[36:14] down and that's what's the matter
[36:16] reading the scripture is Right preaching
[36:19] the gospel is right that's why we're
[36:20] doing it it's right but your foundation
[36:23] is wrong tear out your mental conception
[36:27] of things and get God In Your Heart by
[36:30] the shedding of the blood and then build
[36:32] from there
[36:35] if you've got your own mental conception
[36:37] of here's how God should do things hear
[36:39] how this should be here's the direction
[36:41] what I'm going to make my life stop
[36:45] tear it down
[36:46] and say God I'm coming to the foundation
[36:49] of a experience with Jesus Christ and
[36:53] I'm going to build from there a life
[36:55] that is yielded in your hands
[36:59] now
[37:01] if we were to to look at it purpose is a
[37:04] very challenging thing to really nail
[37:08] down like what is your purpose
[37:11] why I mean you're all sitting here
[37:13] breathing for some reason because we're
[37:16] not here by chance God placed you here
[37:18] on this Earth for a reason you're here
[37:20] for a purpose you have been chosen and
[37:22] placed here in this particular hour
[37:24] now what is that purpose
[37:29] and the only one that can really tell
[37:31] you that is the one who placed you here
[37:37] but your purpose your is the your
[37:39] purpose your foundation they all go
[37:41] together and so I would be asking the
[37:44] question what is your foundation
[37:48] what is your life built on your life is
[37:50] built on something there is something
[37:52] your life is built on
[37:54] what is that
[37:58] what is that Foundation
[38:01] could something Shake That Foundation
[38:05] will that Foundation pass away
[38:07] is it an eternal Foundation
[38:13] if it's not
[38:15] some point in your life a storm is going
[38:17] to come
[38:18] the winds are going to blow
[38:21] and you will fall
[38:25] but if you've been built Upon This Rock
[38:29] if you have anchored your life in Christ
[38:32] Jesus the winds can blow the storm can
[38:36] howl
[38:37] and that house will stand
[38:40] now
[38:41] a lot of the inspiration that I get for
[38:44] this is from a beautiful sermon brother
[38:46] brand preached called lean not to thine
[38:48] own understanding if you have a pencil
[38:51] and a paper here anybody have a pencil
[38:53] and paper here take out your pencil and
[38:54] paper and I want you to write down this
[38:56] sermon lean not to your own
[38:58] understanding unto thine own
[39:00] understanding it's 1965 January the 20th
[39:04] and it was preached here in Phoenix
[39:07] that sermon is just beautiful
[39:12] goes on in that sermon speaking about
[39:14] how Solomon reads this he reads this
[39:16] verse lean not unto thine own
[39:18] understanding it shows how Solomon is is
[39:20] telling them he says I don't think he
[39:22] was telling them not to get an education
[39:23] he says that's you know that's something
[39:25] that's it's good it's nice to have an
[39:27] education and so much of our Lives is
[39:29] focused on you you get up you go to
[39:31] school you get your high school and then
[39:32] you finish with your your high school
[39:34] you go on to your college or whatever
[39:36] you're doing it's it's focused on
[39:38] education education education for years
[39:40] years of your life focused on education
[39:43] and that's all right that's that's not a
[39:47] bad thing but that is not what you're
[39:50] going to understand God by
[39:52] Solomon was trying to advise his sons
[39:55] not to be illiterate but not to lean to
[39:59] their understanding
[40:00] that understanding will never tell you
[40:04] the realities of the word of God
[40:07] it's a finite mind
[40:09] Solomon was telling him that when you
[40:12] get to the end of your life you come
[40:14] down to the end of the road
[40:16] after death is the judgment and God's
[40:19] not going to ask you hey uh
[40:21] can I see your Bachelor you know your
[40:23] degree do you have a degree um like I
[40:26] really need to see that to to see if you
[40:28] qualify for heaven I no
[40:31] like you all know that's absolutely
[40:33] ridiculous God could care less what kind
[40:35] of an education you have when you get to
[40:38] the other side
[40:40] he will not ask about your education he
[40:42] will not ask about how many degrees you
[40:45] have he will not ask how well you
[40:46] understand geometry
[40:49] he's not concerned about that but there
[40:51] is something that he's going to ask he's
[40:54] going to ask you what you did about the
[40:56] understanding of God's word that's where
[40:59] the requirement comes because that your
[41:01] education is fine but the word of God is
[41:05] live
[41:06] it's education is sand you cannot build
[41:10] your life
[41:12] on the sand
[41:14] education doesn't work
[41:17] so what about the American dream of
[41:20] money and prosperity
[41:22] you know we're going to build our life
[41:24] around finances we're going to I mean if
[41:27] you guys aren't working then you need to
[41:30] get Christ in your heart because all
[41:31] Christians work but you need to have
[41:34] that ambition you need to have a desire
[41:36] to actually be productive member of
[41:37] humanity but that is not
[41:40] your purpose your purpose is not to have
[41:43] a lot of money that's not what God
[41:45] created you for he didn't create you to
[41:48] go out here and work nine to five for 40
[41:51] years and then die the day after you
[41:53] retire and that was the end of your life
[41:55] and what did you do
[41:57] that's not the focus of your life is
[42:01] your Prosperity the money you can't
[42:04] build on that what is that
[42:06] sand
[42:08] that's not a solid foundation
[42:11] what are you building your life on
[42:16] what is the foundation of everything in
[42:20] your life
[42:27] you know there was that man
[42:29] who was really prospering
[42:32] he was really prospering after he walked
[42:34] away from Jesus
[42:37] he was the Rich Young Ruler he was asked
[42:40] will you follow me
[42:42] and when he realized that it was going
[42:44] to cost him that job opportunity that he
[42:46] wanted to have or whatever it was
[42:49] he says no I can't do that and when he
[42:52] went you know what his finances didn't
[42:54] fall apart
[42:55] they got better they got better and
[42:57] better until he was so busy pulling down
[42:58] Barnes and building bigger ones and
[43:00] trying to figure out what he was going
[43:01] to do with his 401k and all of his
[43:04] excess funds he just didn't know what to
[43:05] do with them and how is he going to
[43:06] store them in these Barns and
[43:09] while he's planning all of his riches
[43:13] God looks down and says Thou fool this
[43:16] night your soul is required
[43:23] and you know
[43:25] he lifted up his eyes in hell
[43:28] he said oh God let me go back and
[43:31] preached to my family and tell them
[43:34] tell them don't go the way I win don't
[43:37] build your life the way I did it don't
[43:39] do it
[43:41] he says they have the prophets
[43:45] they have Moses if they won't obey the
[43:48] word you think they're going to believe
[43:49] a man raised from the dead
[43:52] he had a burden for Souls once he
[43:55] stepped into an eternal perspective
[43:58] once he realized what it was really all
[44:00] about
[44:02] he wasn't asking you know can I go and
[44:04] make that last business deal
[44:07] of course not
[44:08] you know hey I almost had that Barn
[44:10] finish can I just go back and finish it
[44:12] he didn't care
[44:13] but you know what he didn't care about
[44:15] that those people he loved would not
[44:17] make the same mistake he made follow the
[44:20] same path he went and fall
[44:22] in the Calamity that he went in
[44:26] Matthew chapter 6 33 it says seek ye
[44:30] first the kingdom of God
[44:34] and his righteousness and all these
[44:38] things shall be added unto you
[44:41] those things you know food and raiment
[44:44] and
[44:45] a house to live in that's good
[44:48] God will add it if you seek him first
[44:53] you place God as the foundation of your
[44:57] entire life let everything be built upon
[45:00] that
[45:01] and God will add everything else you
[45:04] need
[45:06] the Branham says here
[45:09] about trying to build your life around
[45:10] being a beautiful girl
[45:13] he says sometimes a pretty girl her
[45:15] beauty becomes a curse to her
[45:17] she finds it out and somebody tells her
[45:19] about it and she wants to be like some
[45:20] movie star or something instead of
[45:23] trying to pattern her life after Jesus
[45:26] Christ she builds her whole Foundation
[45:28] upon that and not knowing that she's
[45:30] only got five years of real life from 15
[45:34] to 20 and then she starts dying and you
[45:37] base your whole hope upon that knowing
[45:41] that you got to get old if you live
[45:43] you've got to get old you've got to
[45:45] break down and the Beauty full face that
[45:47] you'll have will rot out there in the
[45:49] grave someday and the bugs will eat it
[45:50] up so there's no Eternal foundation on
[45:54] popularity or who you are or what you
[45:57] are that has no real Foundation it's not
[46:01] there
[46:03] popularity what your friends think about
[46:05] you
[46:06] do not try and build your life off of
[46:09] the Hat for one thing it's it's not only
[46:12] you know sand it's extremely Shifty
[46:15] Sands it's constantly changing you can't
[46:18] build your life off of you know the
[46:20] collective opinion of your teenage
[46:22] friends or your 30 year old pins or your
[46:25] 50 year old friends or whatever they are
[46:27] it's just not going to work
[46:28] because one day they're going to have an
[46:30] opinion this way and that's what he said
[46:32] but then you go talk to to them over
[46:34] there and they said the exact opposite
[46:35] and you'll end up just being a circus
[46:39] clown running around in circles trying
[46:40] to please everybody and finally pleasing
[46:42] nobody and being miserable
[46:45] you can't build your life off of
[46:46] people's opinion
[46:47] you can't try and change yourself based
[46:50] off of well this person says I should be
[46:52] this way or where I'm going to try and
[46:53] be more like that person or I want to be
[46:55] that person
[46:57] no no you can't build your life off of
[47:00] an imitation of someone else
[47:03] brother Brown he says this now I love it
[47:06] he says now because she did it I will
[47:09] too because he did it I will to you
[47:11] that's hypocrisy you are what you are by
[47:15] the grace of God and just be yourself
[47:18] God will love you better and the people
[47:21] will love you better too if you'll just
[47:24] be yourself be honest sincere and what
[47:27] you do and God will bless your efforts
[47:31] really focusing on Ministry there people
[47:33] trying to be this type of person or that
[47:35] type of person he says just be yourself
[47:38] now that's not a cop-out okay you don't
[47:42] just say well you know my natural self
[47:43] is just grumpy so I'm just going to be
[47:45] myself no that's not what we're trying
[47:49] to get at here or well just be myself
[47:51] well I just don't feel like being
[47:55] in church today
[47:57] is that the self we're talking about
[47:59] no
[48:02] you know as a minister you know I I
[48:04] recently I was uh with another Minister
[48:07] and and God gives him a lot of visions
[48:09] and he's he uh
[48:12] is give has a gift of discernment and he
[48:15] sees things in people's lives and he'll
[48:17] pray with them and just to see that that
[48:20] gift like that it's amazing it's amazing
[48:23] to see a supernatural gift like that
[48:25] he was born that way he was that way
[48:28] when he was out a drunkard on the street
[48:29] it's just a gift in his life but to see
[48:32] how God can use a person like that to
[48:35] speak into a life and things that I know
[48:37] that's there and somebody else he
[48:39] doesn't have a clue you know their name
[48:40] and he'll be just praying for them and
[48:42] also and he'll just stop and I I
[48:44] remember one situation we were standing
[48:46] at a prayer line and
[48:48] this sister came up and
[48:50] she was just like oh I just want to have
[48:52] more of God
[48:53] I'm like
[48:55] it just didn't resonate it didn't
[48:57] it didn't resonate it was just like well
[49:00] that's good and I'm like I'm trying to
[49:01] enter in I'm like well
[49:03] all right you know we're gonna pray for
[49:05] more of God and I was trying to enter
[49:06] into that prayer it just wasn't there
[49:10] and this brother's just standing there
[49:13] and he just
[49:15] starts staring at her very peculiarly
[49:18] and then he just says you demon of
[49:19] suicide I come against you in the name
[49:21] of Jesus Christ
[49:23] and she hit the floor because that's not
[49:25] what she came up for
[49:27] that's not what she was standing there
[49:29] saying but there was a spirit of God
[49:31] that discerned that
[49:32] and God was able to do something for
[49:34] that sister
[49:35] now
[49:37] I like seeing God help people I like
[49:39] seeing God do things like that for
[49:41] somebody and so inside of me is like
[49:44] well you know I'd like to
[49:47] be like that
[49:50] but I can't
[49:52] if I try to be anything other than the
[49:54] way God Made Me
[49:56] I'll be a hypocrite
[49:58] but the me that I want to be
[50:02] is the me that comes from dwelling in
[50:05] the presence of God it's the me that
[50:07] comes from dwelling in the holiest of
[50:09] holies and the Shekinah Glory where
[50:11] Aaron's rod budded and brought forth
[50:13] almonds and fruit in one night that's
[50:15] the me that I want to be I don't want to
[50:17] be the me that's an old Dead stick that
[50:19] was just left out in the wilderness I
[50:21] want to be the me that comes from
[50:22] dwelling in the presence of God
[50:24] dedicated as a life of service to him
[50:28] I want to be me but I want to be that
[50:31] mean
[50:34] be the you that's your full potential in
[50:37] Jesus Christ who God actually made you
[50:39] to be
[50:42] not what your college career advisor
[50:46] said you should be
[50:50] now there's been people who
[50:53] built their life upon that Solid Rock
[50:58] and you know they didn't really fit in
[51:01] they were different
[51:03] there was a farmer one time and
[51:06] he said a voice spoke to him and told
[51:08] him to go build a boat and he did
[51:11] and everybody said he was a nut
[51:14] and he stood there in the door of that
[51:16] Ark crying out judgment's coming there's
[51:20] a storm coming destruction's coming
[51:22] you've got to hear my words you've got
[51:24] to get into this Ark and he stood there
[51:26] in that door
[51:28] and they laughed at him
[51:30] they mocked him
[51:31] they says we're fine we don't need what
[51:33] you have he says it's the only way
[51:35] you'll survive get into this Arc
[51:40] they didn't heat him
[51:42] not only did their lives wash away but
[51:44] the fact is they they were enabling us
[51:48] to get to church tonight as fossil fuel
[51:52] they didn't heed
[51:55] the message of their hour
[51:57] and they were destroyed
[52:00] Moses stood there
[52:03] in the doorway
[52:04] crying out come underneath this Blood
[52:08] dripping down the lentils of the door
[52:10] get into the behind this door get under
[52:11] this Blood outside of this is death
[52:15] and those who heeded that message those
[52:18] who realized that this was the word for
[52:21] their hour this guy that came walking
[52:23] out of the Wilderness after 40 years of
[52:25] being a runaway criminal he comes
[52:28] walking out of the Wilderness and he's
[52:30] standing there but if I don't obey that
[52:32] message
[52:34] it's death
[52:37] they recognized something that was there
[52:40] you know why
[52:42] it was Vindicated
[52:44] it had been proved that this wasn't just
[52:48] his own idea
[52:50] and they heeded that word and they built
[52:52] their life around what that prophet told
[52:56] them
[52:57] and if they failed to
[53:00] trouble was on the road and death struck
[53:02] left and right in the center
[53:05] every time they would fail to follow the
[53:08] word for that day and they'd start
[53:10] getting impatient with God they'd start
[53:13] saying God you know I know you let us
[53:15] out here I know you did the supernatural
[53:16] I know you did all of these things I
[53:18] know how you've done this but
[53:20] right now I want this and I want it now
[53:24] and they wouldn't even ask they would
[53:26] just murmur and complain instead of
[53:28] asking an all-sufficient all-powerful
[53:31] God to provide their daily need
[53:37] Moses stood there
[53:41] on the word that he had been given and
[53:44] those who came and gathered round that
[53:47] rock
[53:49] had life
[53:50] Joshua and Caleb they stood upon a word
[53:53] that said they could take a land filled
[53:57] with Giants and obstacles and everything
[53:59] impossible to human reasoning as an
[54:01] untrained military army
[54:03] but they said
[54:05] if God's going to give it to us
[54:08] then those Giants are bread
[54:11] it's nothing
[54:13] they stood upon it
[54:15] and what did they do
[54:18] they built their life upon that word
[54:21] that they had received
[54:24] and they did The Impossible
[54:27] they lived a life that's a legend
[54:31] but it's true
[54:33] it was a little girl one time
[54:36] came in contact with an angel and that
[54:38] angel told her she was going to bring
[54:40] forth the Messiah
[54:43] and you know what
[54:44] she believed it
[54:47] she couldn't explain it
[54:49] she didn't understand how it was going
[54:50] to work
[54:52] it didn't make common sense it was not
[54:55] scientific
[54:57] but she believed it with everything that
[54:59] was within her and she says be it unto
[55:01] me according to Thy Word
[55:04] and she manifested what the prophets had
[55:07] been prophesying up for thousands of
[55:09] years because she accepted
[55:12] her purpose
[55:14] she recognized this is why I'm here
[55:18] God has chosen me for this
[55:22] and she yielded her life to that
[55:25] she was criticized
[55:27] she was mocked she was misunderstood
[55:31] said she was a liar said she was immoral
[55:34] it didn't really turn out that well
[55:37] I mean finally he becomes a rabbi and
[55:40] he's crucified naked and she's sitting
[55:43] there at that cross
[55:47] still being ridiculed still being made
[55:49] fun of
[55:55] we're not doing this
[55:57] for Earthly popularity
[55:59] we're not building our life on Earthly
[56:02] success Earthly Ambitions Earthly values
[56:05] that is not what we're here for
[56:07] your life is not to be built upon
[56:10] this Earth's temporal things
[56:15] but so many times
[56:18] it is
[56:19] so many times we build our life around
[56:22] the next promotion at work or the next
[56:25] career opportunity or oh if I do this
[56:28] then that person will like me more if I
[56:30] do this maybe that guy will say
[56:32] something to me and I and it's like hold
[56:34] on hold on
[56:36] Center yourself Center your entire being
[56:40] on Christ Jesus
[56:45] there's many people who have failed to
[56:48] trust in the Lord with all their heart
[56:51] and they begin to lean to their own
[56:52] understanding the first one that ever
[56:54] leaned to their own understanding was
[56:56] Eve and it plunged the entire human race
[56:59] into death
[57:01] because she trusted in her own
[57:05] reasoning trusted in her own perspective
[57:08] of how things ought to be
[57:11] don't do that
[57:13] get yourself to that solid word get
[57:16] yourself to that shirt Foundation build
[57:18] everything in your life on that because
[57:22] everything else will pass away
[57:23] everything else will be shaken what can
[57:26] be shaken will be shaken and if your
[57:28] life is built on anything less than
[57:31] Christ that Solid Rock
[57:33] you will fall because the storm will
[57:36] come
[57:37] it will come
[57:40] and in this day and age
[57:42] it doesn't just come when you're 30 or
[57:44] 40 or 50.
[57:46] you'll face tremendous
[57:49] satanic attacks at 10 11 12 years old
[57:55] we're living in a very dark age
[57:58] but we have a word that brings us light
[58:02] that gives us confidence that gives us a
[58:05] place of Refuge
[58:07] do not lean to your understanding don't
[58:10] lean to your own
[58:13] comprehension of the word of God your
[58:16] own thinking of the word of God well
[58:18] yeah I think it says this but you know I
[58:20] think it really would make more sense if
[58:22] we did it this way and I know God he
[58:24] said not to do that but God's a good God
[58:26] and he really wouldn't kill us and and
[58:28] it probably
[58:29] don't even start as soon as that
[58:32] question mark to the word of God comes
[58:34] across your heart death sets in
[58:38] that's a direct quote
[58:42] so what is the true foundation
[58:46] that your life should be built on
[58:47] Matthias what's your life built on is it
[58:50] built on getting married well that's
[58:51] pretty nice but if your life's not built
[58:54] on Jesus Christ your life will fall
[58:55] apart
[58:57] if your life is built on anything less
[58:59] than Jesus Christ
[59:02] you're heading
[59:05] for a storm
[59:06] and that storm will destroy you
[59:10] remember in that oncoming storm he says
[59:12] but what you need is that wind that came
[59:14] on Pentecost that rushing Mighty Wind
[59:16] that's able to drive back the storm
[59:21] now
[59:23] the word of God is your sure Foundation
[59:27] and
[59:28] I think I've been clear enough that
[59:30] we're not looking at the word of God
[59:33] of Noah's day
[59:34] and going and building a boat the word
[59:37] of God is the message of this hour that
[59:40] you need to have your life built upon
[59:44] if you're building your life upon Noah's
[59:47] message you're in trouble because we're
[59:50] not in Noah's Day friends
[59:52] if you're building your life on Moses's
[59:54] message
[59:55] you're in trouble because this is not
[59:57] Moses's day you've got to recognize your
[1:00:01] day and its message and find that Solid
[1:00:04] Rock because that message of the hour
[1:00:08] is Jesus Christ that's where he is if
[1:00:11] you wanted to follow Jesus right now you
[1:00:13] don't go to Galilee and wander around
[1:00:14] the hills and sleep in boats and
[1:00:16] live out in the mountains 2000 years ago
[1:00:19] you did because two thousand well two
[1:00:21] thousand years ago Jesus would have been
[1:00:22] a carpenter I think right now but two
[1:00:24] thousand year goes approximately
[1:00:26] there was a man and if you wanted to
[1:00:28] follow him you sold everything you had
[1:00:32] and he walked around without a home
[1:00:34] without a job
[1:00:36] and you followed him
[1:00:38] but if you want to follow him right now
[1:00:41] don't go to Jerusalem
[1:00:44] that's not where he's at
[1:00:45] he is in the message of the hour this is
[1:00:49] Christ revealing himself today
[1:00:51] now
[1:00:53] do you know the message
[1:00:55] like you know about it but has God come
[1:00:58] down and revealed it personally in your
[1:01:01] heart
[1:01:06] the God made it real to you
[1:01:09] because that's the foundation
[1:01:12] it's the revelation of the word of God
[1:01:14] when God comes down and he reveals in
[1:01:17] your heart who he is he begins to reveal
[1:01:20] his word in your heart and it becomes
[1:01:22] personable it becomes you in God when
[1:01:25] God begins to do that you will have a
[1:01:27] church that is built upon a rock that
[1:01:29] the Gates of Hell cannot shake down
[1:01:32] but if it's built on well
[1:01:34] daddy said this and that about the
[1:01:37] message and and the Pastor said this
[1:01:39] well that's great that's wonderful but
[1:01:42] what did God reveal personally to your
[1:01:44] heart because when it's revealed to you
[1:01:46] I don't care how dark that storm is I
[1:01:49] don't care how hard those winds blow
[1:01:51] you will have a rock
[1:01:54] that nothing can Shake You Down
[1:01:59] now I want to just really nail down this
[1:02:03] point of not leaning to your own
[1:02:05] understanding by showing you the
[1:02:07] comparison of humanity to God and that
[1:02:10] the simple facts are you're stupid
[1:02:13] okay
[1:02:15] God is infinite
[1:02:17] God is the creator of all heavens and
[1:02:19] earth and of the universe
[1:02:21] he's an infinite God he knows every
[1:02:24] breath that you'd breathe and how deep
[1:02:25] it would go into your lungs that's
[1:02:27] infinite now if he's infinite that makes
[1:02:30] him omniscient that's right and if he's
[1:02:33] omniscient that makes him omnipresent
[1:02:35] because he knows just exactly the minute
[1:02:38] our time to the split instance of a 55th
[1:02:41] of a second when it's going to happen
[1:02:45] see get the idea now then he knows all
[1:02:49] things and that's the reason he has all
[1:02:52] power knows all things and can do all
[1:02:55] things
[1:02:56] this universe that we live in is
[1:02:58] extraordinarily big
[1:03:00] it it's you can't understand it uh
[1:03:03] there's just no way because
[1:03:05] well we're stupid
[1:03:09] it's believed that the there are more
[1:03:11] stars in the universe than there are
[1:03:12] grains of sand on every Beach on Earth
[1:03:16] now that's a lot
[1:03:19] and you know what our whole personal
[1:03:21] Universe here is all circled around one
[1:03:24] star with all of our planets and Mars
[1:03:25] and Jupiter and Saturn and all this
[1:03:27] we're all going around one star
[1:03:30] and those other stars out there have
[1:03:31] other planets circling around them
[1:03:34] and there's more stars out there than
[1:03:35] there are Sands of sea on every seashore
[1:03:38] and there's multiple planets circling
[1:03:40] every one of those stars as far as We
[1:03:42] Know
[1:03:44] things just got really big
[1:03:45] and we got really small
[1:03:49] but then you come down the other way you
[1:03:51] come down to that microscopic world
[1:03:54] you come down to that Snowflake and
[1:03:56] every single snowflake is intricate and
[1:03:58] unique in itself
[1:04:01] never found two snowflakes that were the
[1:04:03] same
[1:04:04] you get down to that microscopic level
[1:04:06] of of the the molecules and how they
[1:04:09] come together and it's an entire
[1:04:10] universe in there the human body is so
[1:04:13] complex that they can't even begin to
[1:04:15] understand the complexities of it how
[1:04:18] does the brain work how do these things
[1:04:19] happen they dabble around they they play
[1:04:21] with it they can't figure it out
[1:04:24] they're playing with life and when you
[1:04:26] find out what life is you'll know who
[1:04:28] God is
[1:04:30] they can see these things happen but
[1:04:32] they don't know why it happens that way
[1:04:33] they don't know what does it they don't
[1:04:35] understand the reason of it they don't
[1:04:37] understand what's making it all run
[1:04:40] you get down to that molecules and you
[1:04:42] get down to the atomic structure and you
[1:04:44] have these protons and these neutrons
[1:04:46] and these electrons spinning around you
[1:04:48] tell me what makes an electron spin
[1:04:51] why don't they all just stop what got
[1:04:53] them started spinning in the first place
[1:04:55] what is electricity
[1:04:57] why does it go from one direction to the
[1:04:59] other direction
[1:05:02] what is gravity
[1:05:05] if you're a little bit into science
[1:05:08] they're not real sure what gravity is
[1:05:12] now Jubilee knows it what it is
[1:05:16] she knows that it happens
[1:05:18] you trip you fall that's gravity
[1:05:21] but what is it really
[1:05:24] they don't know
[1:05:27] what causes a blade of grass to spring
[1:05:29] up come to life
[1:05:31] grow in the ground
[1:05:34] they don't know
[1:05:37] everything from the immense city of the
[1:05:39] universe to the microscopic scale
[1:05:42] and God created it all about just
[1:05:44] blowing it off of his hand
[1:05:49] God is infinitely big and infinitely
[1:05:52] small
[1:05:54] now
[1:05:56] I'm going to step into a little bit of
[1:05:57] math here so if you don't like math just
[1:05:59] bite your fingers so you stay awake all
[1:06:01] right now how long ago do you figure one
[1:06:04] million seconds is
[1:06:07] 1 million seconds
[1:06:09] that's about 12 and a half days all
[1:06:12] right
[1:06:13] so 1 million seconds is about 12 and a
[1:06:16] half days now we're going to step it
[1:06:17] back just a little farther how long ago
[1:06:20] do you think one trillion seconds is
[1:06:23] what do you think
[1:06:25] a lot
[1:06:26] you got it how many years ago do you
[1:06:29] think one trillion seconds is
[1:06:31] a thousand years what do you think
[1:06:34] 2 000 years
[1:06:36] girls go way bigger than that what do
[1:06:38] you guys think
[1:06:42] what do you think
[1:06:44] five thousand years now we're getting
[1:06:46] somewhere
[1:06:48] you're a McGary by your face I'm pretty
[1:06:49] sure what do you think
[1:06:55] the one that's not looking at me
[1:06:57] last guess was five thousand
[1:07:01] how much
[1:07:02] four thousand all right Lilia
[1:07:07] ten or fifteen thousand
[1:07:11] it's over 31 000 years ago
[1:07:14] one trillion seconds is over 31 000
[1:07:18] years in the past
[1:07:20] all right so next time you hear about a
[1:07:22] trillion dollar budget nobody has a clue
[1:07:24] what they're talking about
[1:07:27] one trillion years seconds ago
[1:07:30] is 30
[1:07:34] 1710 years ago
[1:07:37] that's one trillion and in the
[1:07:40] mathematical world 1 trillion really
[1:07:42] isn't that big
[1:07:45] now I'm going to get into something
[1:07:47] that's
[1:07:48] downright ridiculous it's called
[1:07:50] Graham's number uh does anybody here
[1:07:52] know about Graham's number
[1:07:56] right of course
[1:08:00] all right so we have one weirdo here
[1:08:03] that knows about Graham's number all
[1:08:05] right
[1:08:06] so for the rest of you it's a
[1:08:07] mathematical equation that deals with
[1:08:09] the graphing and the color combinations
[1:08:10] that are possible within hyper cubes and
[1:08:13] higher dimensions
[1:08:15] and if you're lost don't worry they all
[1:08:17] are too because they really can't quite
[1:08:19] grasp what they're dealing with anyway
[1:08:21] now I'm going to try and explain this to
[1:08:25] you they're trying to find out the
[1:08:27] minimum possible combinations in this
[1:08:30] math problem
[1:08:31] and the maximum possible combinations in
[1:08:34] this math problem all right
[1:08:36] so to do that they had to kind of use a
[1:08:39] a completely different form of
[1:08:41] mathematic equations
[1:08:43] so to start with in this math problem
[1:08:45] we'll take a three
[1:08:48] and we'll use a something called up
[1:08:51] arrow notation all right so you have a
[1:08:54] three up Arrow three
[1:08:56] okay that simply means three to the
[1:08:59] power of three what's three to the power
[1:09:01] of three
[1:09:03] 27. all right
[1:09:05] so now we go one more Arrow all right
[1:09:09] three up Arrow up Arrow three
[1:09:12] now what that's done is it Stacks those
[1:09:15] exponents so now we have three to the
[1:09:18] power of three but that 3 also has a
[1:09:20] power of three okay
[1:09:23] so when we solve that problem down we
[1:09:27] take three to the power of 3 which is 27
[1:09:29] to the power of uh 3 to the power of 27
[1:09:32] anyway we break that down we come up
[1:09:34] with a number that's 7.6 trillion
[1:09:38] something long
[1:09:40] now that's a really big number 7.6
[1:09:43] trillion that's huge
[1:09:45] uh now
[1:09:49] that was with three threes stacked on
[1:09:51] top of each other okay when you add that
[1:09:54] third one there
[1:09:55] no that was sorry 27 20. I think it was
[1:09:58] 28 threes anyway you add that third one
[1:10:00] there now you got three up Arrow three
[1:10:03] to the third power
[1:10:05] that gets wildly out of control
[1:10:08] now that exponent going up is seven
[1:10:11] something trillion tall in exponents
[1:10:14] okay
[1:10:16] we're really really big all right
[1:10:18] and finally we get to the beginning of
[1:10:21] Graham's number which is three up over
[1:10:24] Arrow four times to three okay that's
[1:10:28] the beginning and when we solve this
[1:10:31] problem which is
[1:10:32] ridiculously huge
[1:10:34] I mean the exponents in it are seven
[1:10:37] trillion High
[1:10:38] we get what's called G1 it's the
[1:10:41] starting of the equation okay and so
[1:10:44] then the next part of the equation
[1:10:47] you take G1
[1:10:49] and you put that in for how many up
[1:10:51] arrows you put into the equation
[1:10:53] all right
[1:10:55] so you've got something quintillion
[1:10:58] quadrillion up arrows into the equation
[1:11:02] and you solve that down all right now we
[1:11:06] did three up arrows no two up arrows two
[1:11:08] up arrows was already Seven Something
[1:11:10] trillion all right now they put
[1:11:13] that's two up arrows
[1:11:15] they put something quadrillion up arrows
[1:11:17] into the equation and that gets you to
[1:11:19] G2
[1:11:21] and then you put G2 number of up arrows
[1:11:24] into it and you get to G3 and you keep
[1:11:28] doing this keep doing this bigger and
[1:11:30] bigger numbers until you finally get to
[1:11:32] Graham's number which comes out at G 64.
[1:11:36] all right
[1:11:38] this number is completely Beyond
[1:11:39] Comprehension there is no way you could
[1:11:42] actually understand how big this number
[1:11:44] is they've solved out a couple hundred
[1:11:46] of the digits in the last and part of it
[1:11:49] but they'll never get to the end of it
[1:11:53] because it's too big
[1:11:55] and
[1:11:57] they've finally figured out that the
[1:11:59] answer to this equation that they've
[1:12:00] been trying to solve is somewhere
[1:12:02] between seven
[1:12:03] and g64. somewhere in between there is
[1:12:06] the correct answer
[1:12:08] and that's all they figured out but they
[1:12:10] figure against Infinity they're pretty
[1:12:12] close
[1:12:14] now
[1:12:15] this number is the only number that
[1:12:17] there was one of the first numbers that
[1:12:18] was used constructively at a
[1:12:20] ridiculously large size they were
[1:12:21] actually able to use it instead of just
[1:12:23] creating a ridiculous number they were
[1:12:24] actually using it in a problem
[1:12:26] now if you could ever actually grasp
[1:12:31] this number if you could ever actually
[1:12:33] like if you tried to write it out with
[1:12:35] your with a pen and pencil uh you'd run
[1:12:38] out of trees in the universe you'd run
[1:12:39] out of paper you'd run out of everything
[1:12:42] you couldn't write it out that's how big
[1:12:43] the number is
[1:12:45] how many digits are in it
[1:12:48] if you could ever actually grasp and see
[1:12:50] in your mind
[1:12:52] g64 and what it actually means
[1:12:56] you would become the most dense object
[1:12:58] in the universe you would turn into a
[1:12:59] black hole and you would cease to exist
[1:13:03] it would destroy you it would physically
[1:13:05] destroy you if you could ever grasp
[1:13:09] this number
[1:13:10] and it is a finite number
[1:13:13] and heart God is infinite
[1:13:18] you
[1:13:19] cannot understand god with your own
[1:13:22] intellect
[1:13:23] it's impossible
[1:13:24] if you ever did somehow grasp
[1:13:28] the infinite God it would literally
[1:13:32] destroy you
[1:13:35] you would cease to exist
[1:13:38] because you cannot contain
[1:13:40] that much information within your little
[1:13:44] p brain
[1:13:47] you can't do it
[1:13:49] God knows that he knows you're finite he
[1:13:52] knows your inability
[1:13:54] and so he just said listen
[1:13:56] I'm not going to ask you to understand
[1:13:59] it all
[1:14:00] I'm not going to ask you to be able to
[1:14:02] explain everything
[1:14:04] but I'm going to tell you this trust in
[1:14:07] me with all your heart
[1:14:10] and lean not to your own understanding
[1:14:14] your own understanding can't even grasp
[1:14:16] the finite things
[1:14:19] there is no way you'll ever grasp the
[1:14:22] infinite
[1:14:23] so God never asked you to understand it
[1:14:26] all
[1:14:28] he said you just trust me I'm a whole
[1:14:30] lot bigger than you I know a whole lot
[1:14:33] more than you trust me
[1:14:35] believe what I'm telling you the only
[1:14:38] way you're ever going to gra be able to
[1:14:40] come in contact with me the only way
[1:14:42] you're ever going to able to to
[1:14:43] understand these things is just believe
[1:14:46] what I tell you if I tell you something
[1:14:48] don't try and sit down and reason it all
[1:14:50] out don't try and grasp everything with
[1:14:52] your intellect just believe what I tell
[1:14:55] you
[1:15:00] and if you can do that
[1:15:03] if you can just believe what he tells
[1:15:06] you
[1:15:07] it's absolutely unlimited what God can
[1:15:11] do in your life
[1:15:15] if you can only believe
[1:15:19] what's the rest of the song
[1:15:22] all things are possible
[1:15:25] because when you accept and believe
[1:15:28] in God
[1:15:31] and you believe what he's told you
[1:15:34] whether you can make sense of it or not
[1:15:37] I mean facts are you can never reason it
[1:15:40] out in your mind
[1:15:41] your human intellect is broken
[1:15:45] and you can't grasp god with your mind
[1:15:48] so you believe him by a supernatural
[1:15:50] contact called faith you say Lord if you
[1:15:54] said it then I believe it if this is
[1:15:57] what you said for my life then I'm going
[1:15:59] to believe it I can't explain it I don't
[1:16:01] know how the future is all going to work
[1:16:02] out I don't understand how all the
[1:16:04] details but if you said this for my life
[1:16:07] then that is what I'm gonna build my
[1:16:09] life on because I'm trusting in you
[1:16:17] oh how we would love to have the tongue
[1:16:19] and the vocabulary that could explain it
[1:16:22] to the people what it really is but it
[1:16:25] could not be found on Mortal lips all
[1:16:29] eternity doubtless whether it'll ever
[1:16:32] reveal it how that God Of Heaven ever
[1:16:34] came to the Earth to say poor lost
[1:16:37] wretched sinners
[1:16:41] it'll take all of eternity friends to
[1:16:44] grasp the depth of the love of God
[1:16:51] and that's just one attribute that he
[1:16:54] has
[1:16:56] oh our life must be built upon the
[1:17:00] foundation of Christ's word
[1:17:04] outside of that
[1:17:06] it will fall
[1:17:08] you must have your life built upon the
[1:17:11] Eternal Foundation
[1:17:13] now how do you do that you say I want my
[1:17:17] life built on that Foundation if you've
[1:17:19] got at least a sane mind and you
[1:17:21] recognize how finite we are and how
[1:17:24] small we are then you can recognize I
[1:17:27] want my life built on something that's
[1:17:28] solid I want my life my ambitions my
[1:17:31] goals to be built on something that'll
[1:17:33] actually have value
[1:17:35] now how do you build your life on that
[1:17:37] Foundation
[1:17:39] Jesus said he that heareth my words
[1:17:42] he or he that heareth my sayings and do
[1:17:45] with them
[1:17:46] he's life will be likened to one built
[1:17:48] upon a rock
[1:17:49] now
[1:17:51] all you got to do is do what Jesus said
[1:17:55] but there's just one problem
[1:17:58] you can't
[1:18:01] you can't do it
[1:18:05] you don't have the ability
[1:18:07] to live a perfect life
[1:18:10] you don't have the ability to follow the
[1:18:12] word of God
[1:18:14] in your flesh
[1:18:16] you can't do it
[1:18:18] but that's what the Holy Ghost was given
[1:18:21] for to give you power and speech power
[1:18:24] and prayer and power to live a holy life
[1:18:29] God knows
[1:18:31] that you're incapable so he sends a
[1:18:35] guide he sends the Holy Spirit he sends
[1:18:38] someone that can come down and live
[1:18:40] through you and express his word and
[1:18:43] manifest his word in your life you
[1:18:46] cannot Manifest this word by yourself
[1:18:48] you cannot live this message by yourself
[1:18:51] but if you can come down and you can
[1:18:53] yield yourself to the spirit of God he
[1:18:55] will come down and he will live through
[1:18:57] you and do things through you that you
[1:19:00] know nothing about
[1:19:04] but if you try and build your life on
[1:19:07] your own ability
[1:19:09] you know we can just get a big blue
[1:19:12] stamp and stamp right across your life
[1:19:14] failed
[1:19:17] it won't work
[1:19:21] but if the Holy Spirit comes down
[1:19:23] and enters into your life
[1:19:28] your life will begin to become a
[1:19:30] reflection
[1:19:32] of everything that the prophecies have
[1:19:35] spoken of regarding this last hour
[1:19:42] now
[1:19:44] to musicians would come
[1:19:46] says here
[1:19:48] what is the evidence speaking of the
[1:19:50] Holy Ghost what is the evidence of it
[1:19:52] when that Spirit that's in you can
[1:19:54] punctuate every promise with an amen and
[1:19:58] God will confirm it
[1:20:02] now that's not just a verbal agreeance
[1:20:04] to the word of God
[1:20:06] that's not just saying yep it's the
[1:20:07] truth
[1:20:09] the devil knows there's a God
[1:20:13] he's been defeated by him too many times
[1:20:15] not to know that
[1:20:17] the devil knows the authority that's in
[1:20:19] this word of this hour
[1:20:21] he knows that
[1:20:23] but he cannot live it
[1:20:28] but that's exactly the way it is with
[1:20:30] Jesus Christ they had more speaking in
[1:20:33] his day they had more fruits of the
[1:20:35] spirit they had all kinds of evidences
[1:20:37] you can't pin any evidence down to
[1:20:40] anything but God himself
[1:20:44] manifesting his word that's the only
[1:20:48] true evidence that it's there is that is
[1:20:52] that is that that you're a Christian
[1:20:55] when God comes down
[1:20:57] into your life
[1:20:59] and something inside of you when you
[1:21:01] hear the word of God when you see a
[1:21:03] promise of God that you can be set free
[1:21:05] that you can be delivered that you don't
[1:21:07] have to live in this condition that you
[1:21:09] can receive your healing and there's
[1:21:10] something inside of you that just said I
[1:21:12] believe that yes Lord so be it in my
[1:21:17] life
[1:21:18] and it begins to manifest
[1:21:21] you cannot Manifest this word in your
[1:21:24] own ability you can't build your house
[1:21:26] solid enough you can't build your life
[1:21:28] good enough of your own ability it will
[1:21:30] fall apart but if God can come down and
[1:21:33] he can live inside of you he can begin
[1:21:35] to manifest the promise
[1:21:38] of young people in this hour that are
[1:21:41] going to overcome every single trap of
[1:21:43] the devil
[1:21:45] young people in this hour that are going
[1:21:47] to overcome laodicea and every snare
[1:21:49] that it has young people in this hour
[1:21:51] that are pure and spotless without a
[1:21:55] wrinkle in their garment
[1:21:59] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[1:22:02] lean not to your own understanding
[1:22:06] it's tempting when you're a young person
[1:22:07] because you know everything right now
[1:22:11] the little older you get the less you
[1:22:13] start to know and you'll start to
[1:22:15] understand why those old people don't
[1:22:16] know anything
[1:22:22] trust in the Lord
[1:22:23] [Music]
[1:22:26] not your understanding
[1:22:33] we need to close by
[1:22:36] Billy Bram talks about how
[1:22:39] especially the young ministers he says
[1:22:42] you must Master the thought of human
[1:22:45] ability
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:48] I love how he says that he doesn't say
[1:22:49] human ability but just Master the
[1:22:51] thought of human ability if you even
[1:22:53] think you have ability
[1:22:55] just start you need to start by
[1:22:57] mastering the thought that you even have
[1:22:59] human ability
[1:23:01] God cannot work through your ability God
[1:23:05] cannot do anything through your ability
[1:23:09] your life
[1:23:12] it has to be his
[1:23:14] and when you can Surrender Your Life
[1:23:18] when you can surrender your ability when
[1:23:20] you can surrender everything that you
[1:23:22] are into the hand of God God can come
[1:23:25] down and he can begin to do things
[1:23:27] through you
[1:23:29] can begin to use you in Supernatural
[1:23:31] ways he can begin to use you to do
[1:23:34] things that are Impossible by human
[1:23:36] understanding
[1:23:38] if you can yield
[1:23:41] every fiber of your being yield
[1:23:44] [Music]
[1:23:46] to him
[1:23:49] stand to our feet tonight
[1:23:52] [Music]
[1:23:56] it's just baller heads
[1:24:01] I'm asking you tonight do you recognize
[1:24:03] that there's areas in your life where
[1:24:05] you've been leaning
[1:24:07] to your own understanding
[1:24:12] on your
[1:24:18] something other
[1:24:22] than that sure Foundation
[1:24:28] I'm asking you to talk to the Lord about
[1:24:30] it
[1:24:31] just say Lord I've been wrong
[1:24:34] I've been trusting in these other things
[1:24:37] I've been looking at these other things
[1:24:39] but I'm wanting to come right now this
[1:24:42] night and yield my thinking over to you
[1:24:45] I don't want to trust in my own thinking
[1:24:47] I don't want to trust in my own ability
[1:24:49] I don't want to trust in myself but I
[1:24:51] want to trust in the god
[1:24:54] that's the creator of heavens and earth
[1:25:00] heavenly father I'm asking that you
[1:25:02] would come down here tonight and that
[1:25:04] you would see these hearts that are here
[1:25:06] open before you Lord you know every
[1:25:09] heart you know every aspect of every
[1:25:11] life Lord you know their thoughts you
[1:25:13] know where they're at Lord
[1:25:15] I'm asking that they would recognize
[1:25:18] that they can't do it by themselves
[1:25:22] [Music]
[1:25:24] Lord may they just turn to you with a
[1:25:27] complete and a total yielding
[1:25:32] but may they surrender their being into
[1:25:34] your hands that you might come down and
[1:25:37] direct their path that you might come
[1:25:39] down and stabilize and anchor them Lord
[1:25:43] in such a way that no matter what storm
[1:25:45] would come no matter what challenge
[1:25:47] they'll face in life and it will come
[1:25:50] but you promised that you would never
[1:25:52] leave us you would never forsake us
[1:25:55] you promised that if our life was built
[1:25:58] Upon This Rock
[1:26:00] that when that hour would come
[1:26:03] we would be secure
[1:26:05] [Music]
[1:26:08] the prophet said there's many that have
[1:26:09] been saved because of a warning of an
[1:26:12] oncoming storm
[1:26:15] so Lord I'm praying for these young
[1:26:17] people here tonight before they get into
[1:26:20] that storm before they get into that
[1:26:22] world that just has them where they
[1:26:24] don't know hardly which way is up Lord
[1:26:26] may they have an anchor that will hold
[1:26:29] them
[1:26:36] oh

[1:27:03] understanding of things Lord

[1:35:15] and every decision you make falls back
[1:35:19] to that Foundation
[1:35:22] and it's it's a progressive
[1:35:24] it gets worse and worse
