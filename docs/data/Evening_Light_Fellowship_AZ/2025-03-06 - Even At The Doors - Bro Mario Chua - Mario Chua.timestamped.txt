[37:06] Amen so help me out so we'll turn to
[37:10] Matthew chapter
[37:12] 24 verse 32 and
[37:21] 39 thank you sister Irma for a beautiful
[37:24] song offering tonight
[37:27] so we are hiding in the rock of the
[37:30] revelation of the word of God praise the
[37:33] Lord so in the Book of Matthew uh verse
[37:36] 32 says now learn a parable of the Fig
[37:39] Tree when his branch is yet tender and
[37:42] put it forth leaves you know that summer
[37:45] is nigh so likewise ye when you shall
[37:49] see all these things know that it is
[37:52] near even at the
[37:54] doors verily I say unto you this
[37:57] generation shall not pass till all these
[38:00] things be fulfilled amen Heaven and
[38:03] Earth shall pass away but my words shall
[38:06] not
[38:07] pass away amen but of that day and hour
[38:12] knoweth no
[38:13] man know not angels of heaven but my
[38:17] fathers only
[38:19] amen but as the days of Noah were so
[38:22] shall also the coming of the son of man
[38:25] be and may the Lord had a blessing upon
[38:28] the reading of this word you may be
[38:29] seated
[38:33] amen and you know Matthew chapter 24 is
[38:38] uh the opening of The Seven
[38:40] Seals in verb and in Prophecy
[38:44] form Matthew 24 and Jesus unfold the
[38:48] seven seal in Prophecy form as he
[38:51] answered the two questions of the
[38:54] disciples so I will not read all the
[38:57] Matthew Matthew 24 but it will give you
[38:59] a hint to just study it when you go home
[39:02] Matthew 24 praise God
[39:06] Amen he unfold the seven seal in
[39:10] Prophecy form as he answered the two
[39:12] questions of the
[39:14] disciples and he end it with as it was
[39:19] in the days of
[39:24] Noah which is the mystery of the seven
[39:27] SE the mystery of his
[39:29] coming showing that his second coming
[39:32] would not be the revealing of his
[39:35] Corporal
[39:36] body but by the revealing of the word
[39:39] amen as Matthew chapter 27 said for us
[39:43] the lightning cometh out of the East and
[39:45] shineth unto the West so shall also the
[39:48] coming of the son of man be and we know
[39:51] the light is the revealing of the word
[39:52] into the hearts of the
[39:54] people amen a prophetic worldwide
[39:57] Revelation in the end time from the East
[40:00] unto the West so when the brother Bram
[40:03] preached about the Seven Seals as God
[40:05] unfold the revelation of the Seven Seals
[40:08] in chapter 6 through 8 of Revelation he
[40:11] always tie up Matthew chapter 24 so
[40:15] Matthew 24 is the Seven Seals in word
[40:18] and prophetic form but Revelation chap 6
[40:22] and 8 is in symbol form and I believe
[40:28] that we are
[40:31] already at the end everything is already
[40:35] being unfolded in our generation that's
[40:37] right from the rising of the Antichrist
[40:40] from the the rising of the false prophet
[40:43] amen for Wars and humors of Wars the
[40:48] tribulations and the calamities that we
[40:52] are seeing all around us is just the
[40:55] Fulfillment of what is being opened in
[40:57] our day
[40:59] amen but that will not be my topic for
[41:04] tonight because I will focus on chapter
[41:08] 32 but I would like you to I once again
[41:11] to encourage
[41:13] you to read Matthew
[41:16] 24 and the Book of Revelation the six
[41:19] seal or the seven seal so it will
[41:23] encourage us that the things that we see
[41:25] around us is just the fulfill of
[41:27] scripture being unfolded in our
[41:30] generation so we are the Blessed people
[41:34] because the thing that was hidden from
[41:36] the foundation of the word is now being
[41:38] revealed Among Us Praise the Lord so
[41:40] this in verse 32 now learn the parable
[41:44] of the fig trees and we know that fig
[41:46] Tre represent the the nations of Israel
[41:49] and when his Bron is set Thunder and put
[41:52] it forth leaves ye know that summer is
[41:54] night and we know that when Israel
[41:57] became a nation in 1948 that is also
[42:00] around the time when the voice of the
[42:02] seventh angel the prophetic Ministry of
[42:05] the seventh angel began in its infancy
[42:08] the first pool and the second
[42:10] pool amen so what happened to the the
[42:13] nation of Israel is by by by Nation but
[42:16] to the Gentile is an individual Affair
[42:19] amen so likewise ye when you shall see
[42:23] all these
[42:24] things so brother uh the Lord Jesus
[42:28] Christ is already unfolding what is
[42:30] happening the rise of the Antichrist the
[42:33] false prophet the calamities Wars and
[42:36] humors of Wars all of this and he said
[42:38] so likewise when ye shall see all these
[42:42] things know that it is near even at the
[42:49] doors so the praise even at the door
[42:52] which is the title of my sermon tonight
[42:55] means a rapid closing of the
[42:58] time so it's not about end of the world
[43:02] but it's about the end time and we have
[43:05] arve at the end time we see all the sign
[43:08] around us and we have arrived and he
[43:11] said that even at the door a praise
[43:13] means a rapid closing of the time and
[43:17] even the bulletin of atomic scientist
[43:20] they have a PRI
[43:21] release which we call the Doomsday a
[43:24] symbol clock adopted by atomic scientist
[43:26] to to show how close human beings are
[43:30] considered to be a global
[43:33] catastrophic with midnight standing for
[43:35] annelation or Doomsday even the science
[43:39] know it that's right Washington DC in
[43:43] January 28 2025 the Doomsday Clock Was
[43:47] set at
[43:48] 89 second to midnight the closest clock
[43:53] has ever been to midnight in its 78
[43:56] years years
[43:59] history so we have arrived
[44:02] amen praise the Lord the 2025 clock time
[44:06] signal that the word is on a course of
[44:09] unprecedented risks and that continuing
[44:12] on the car path is a form of
[44:15] Madness and they said that Humanity
[44:18] agging closer to catastrophe an iconic
[44:22] Doomsday Clock moves one second closer
[44:25] to midnight AS Global
[44:28] existential trat rates CL factors
[44:32] include nuclear weapons climate changes
[44:36] artificial intelligence infectious
[44:39] diseases and conflict in Ukraine and in
[44:41] the Middle East so we have
[44:44] arrived we need to to go on few more
[44:47] days of Labor amen and the promise of
[44:50] the changing of our body will take
[44:52] effect in our day we have seen all the
[44:55] scripture being fulfilled in our very
[44:57] eyes that's
[44:58] right but I would like to take the
[45:01] subject even unto the doors the
[45:04] doors and do speak of access or an
[45:07] entrance or an access to the opening of
[45:10] new
[45:12] things and we can certainly see that
[45:15] many doors have been open in this
[45:19] generation both good and
[45:22] evil as fulfillment of Prophecy of
[45:25] Daniel 12 that in the last days
[45:27] knowledge shall
[45:29] increase and people will run to and fro
[45:32] and S Gates will increase so there is a
[45:37] door opening and we certainly see that
[45:40] many doors have been opened in this end
[45:42] time both good and evil doors of
[45:44] Technology doors of science doors of
[45:49] educations doors of politics and doors
[45:52] of space exploration amen doors of
[45:56] artificial intelligence so many doors
[45:58] are being opened in this generation
[46:01] that's
[46:02] right and even the door of hell has been
[46:05] opened in this age and Demon Spirit are
[46:08] plooding into people's life through the
[46:10] eye of gates and all demonic influence
[46:12] of
[46:14] Hollywood we know that Revelation 9 was
[46:17] the opening up of the door of the
[46:19] bottomless pit so Revelation 9:1 to 3
[46:25] and the fif Angel sounded and I saw a
[46:28] star fell down from
[46:31] heaven andto the Earth andto him was
[46:34] given the key of the bottomless pit and
[46:36] he opened the bottomless pit and there
[46:39] arose a smoke out of the pit as the
[46:41] smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and
[46:44] the air were darkened by reason of the
[46:46] smoke of the pit and there came out the
[46:49] smoke Locust upon the Earth and at them
[46:51] was given power as the Scorpions of the
[46:54] Earth have power and we say in the
[46:57] opening of the the the the bottom Le pit
[47:00] it is in fourth dimension which is the
[47:02] science and only through the radi wave
[47:05] of television or whatsoever Cuts up
[47:08] those spirit and it projected into a
[47:10] television they are real amen so we can
[47:13] see even in all the movies that they are
[47:15] they're showing all
[47:18] evils violence evil immorality all of
[47:22] that is projection that came from the
[47:24] opening of the bottomless feet amen
[47:27] we cannot see all around that but the
[47:29] televisions and the radio will pick it
[47:31] up and show it among the people and it
[47:35] influence the people who saw it that's
[47:38] right that's why people are now they are
[47:40] so violent
[47:42] immoral because something because hell
[47:45] is
[47:46] opening if hell is open then the tree of
[47:50] life is also open in last days
[47:52] Revelation 10 Hallelujah the book opened
[47:56] in the right hand of him that came down
[48:00] and we have now access to the Tree of
[48:02] Life once again which is the pure word
[48:04] of God Amen so to open a door you need
[48:08] to have an
[48:10] entrance in first second Peter first 111
[48:13] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[48:15] unto you abundantly into the Everlasting
[48:18] Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[48:20] Christ so we see the seventh angel of
[48:23] this hour has been ministering an
[48:25] entrance just as Noah's message
[48:28] ministered an entrance that caused his
[48:30] group to go through the door of the Ark
[48:32] in Noah's day there best be a
[48:35] ministering of the word of God Amen sir
[48:38] amen just like in the days of
[48:42] Noah remember that when when uh Jesus
[48:47] Christ expounded all this
[48:50] prophecy he said that they are asking
[48:52] when is the son of man coming and he
[48:55] said no one knows
[48:57] even the son don't know anything even
[48:59] the father don't know
[49:02] anything but he put a butt right but at
[49:07] it was in the days of Noah so shall it
[49:09] be right although he didn't explain it
[49:12] but he gave us a hint just like when he
[49:15] preached the seven seal in Christ The
[49:17] Mystery of God revealed God revealed the
[49:20] six seal but in chapter 8 there was
[49:23] silence and the prophet said it's good
[49:26] that he didn't reveal the seven seal but
[49:29] he has revealed it in types and shadows
[49:32] in the Old Testament that's likewise
[49:34] Jesus Christ as it was in the days of
[49:38] Noah so shall it be at the coming of the
[49:40] son of man be
[49:43] amen so as it was in the days of Noah so
[49:46] shall also the coming of the Sun be a
[49:48] voice calling to come up hi through the
[49:51] door so the voice didn't come from the
[49:54] outside of the ACT but the voice came
[49:56] from inside the ark come into the ark so
[50:01] the voice is within the ark and the Ark
[50:04] is only have one door and that door is
[50:06] the Lord Jesus Christ amen Revelation
[50:09] 4:1 after this I look and behold a door
[50:12] was open in heaven after this after the
[50:15] seven Church ages because chapter three
[50:18] is the last of the loudan AG and after
[50:21] after the closing of the door in loud
[50:23] DEA there was a chapter four there was a
[50:25] voice again amen that called him come up
[50:28] here
[50:30] John and a door was open in
[50:34] heaven just like a door was opened in
[50:37] the ark and the first voice which I
[50:40] heard was it were of the trumpet talking
[50:43] with me which said come up hi and I will
[50:46] show you things which must be Hereafter
[50:49] amen there is a prophetic Ministry
[50:52] prophetic message that was given to the
[50:54] Bride of Jesus Christ amen he was no
[50:58] longer under the Candlestick
[51:01] light but there is an Open Door in
[51:03] heaven amen and J saw a door open in
[51:06] heaven and this voice that spoke to him
[51:08] was the voice of Christ calling him to
[51:11] come up
[51:13] hither through the door just as we found
[51:15] that it was the same voice calling no
[51:17] one his group to come up through the
[51:19] door and into the ark before the
[51:20] Judgment in Noah's time the same voice
[51:24] that called Noah come up here
[51:27] is the same voice that called JN in his
[51:30] last
[51:31] days doors give people entrance and
[51:35] access to whatever beyond the door and
[51:38] you need a key to the door and we know
[51:42] that we know that key is the Book of
[51:43] Revelation Revelation 10 gave us
[51:45] complete access to the tree of life
[51:47] which is
[51:49] Christ while Revelation chapter 9 has
[51:52] given us complete access to the tree of
[51:55] good and evil so the true trees is
[51:58] standing side by side today in our
[52:01] generation that is why the tree that Eve
[52:05] had complete access to in Eden we also
[52:09] have access to that same two trees again
[52:12] in this last days both of those trees
[52:15] that were in Eden are now with us again
[52:17] in this end time age that's right
[52:21] Hallelujah and so when JN who represent
[52:23] the end time believers saw a door open
[52:27] in heaven and heard the voice of Christ
[52:29] calling him to come up here in
[52:31] Revelation 4 and 1 there is always a
[52:34] voice not voices amen there are so many
[52:38] voices in these last days but J heard
[52:42] only one voice and that is the voice of
[52:44] the Sabbath angel in this last days
[52:46] there is no other messenger after this
[52:49] messenger amen
[52:51] hallelujah and we know that the voice
[52:53] was the same voice of Revelation chapter
[52:55] 7
[52:57] which was the voice of the seventh angel
[52:58] and the voice was also the shout part of
[53:01] the Rapture Pace that gathered the bride
[53:04] together under her message in the bright
[53:06] AGS so there's no other
[53:10] voice outside of the voice of the
[53:12] seventh
[53:13] angel because the voice of the seventh
[53:16] angel start with a
[53:18] shout and that is the first Pace or the
[53:22] beginning cycle of the Rapture Am The
[53:24] Voice the shout and the Trump amen
[53:27] hallelujah so there's no other messenger
[53:29] outside of the seventh age messenger
[53:32] because he has already started the
[53:35] process of the changing of our bodies
[53:39] Hallelujah yes sir so we are now living
[53:41] in the time now when Lucifer is being
[53:44] united in an invisible Union with his
[53:49] subject by means of the door of Science
[53:52] and echology being open in this day but
[53:56] God is also uniting with his subject
[53:59] with is the bride hallelujah amen so
[54:01] when the seven seal was open we know
[54:03] that seal was Christ and when he opened
[54:06] up he gathered all his subject unto
[54:09] himself and what is his subject the
[54:12] bride it's no longer called you a church
[54:15] but I call you now a bride Hallelujah so
[54:19] there is an invisible Union between the
[54:21] bride and the groom in these last days
[54:24] improving his word
[54:28] paragraph 235 he said and Jesus said as
[54:31] it was in the days of
[54:35] Sodom now watch close in the days of
[54:39] Sodom so will it be at the coming of the
[54:42] son of
[54:43] men when the son of man is being
[54:46] revealed not no more as a
[54:49] church not the church ages
[54:52] dispensation but the bride is called
[54:57] in that day the son of man will be
[55:00] revealed
[55:02] amen the son of man will be revealed we
[55:05] need to distinguish between the son of
[55:08] men and a son of
[55:11] men the one that is being revealed to
[55:13] the bride is the son of men not a son of
[55:17] men a son of men can commit mistake he
[55:21] is
[55:22] failable but the son of man is
[55:25] infallible he that mistakes so that's
[55:27] why the Bride of Jesus Christ can
[55:29] distinguish between a son of man and the
[55:32] son of man operating in one
[55:35] body because it is the revealing of the
[55:38] son of man and the son of man is Jesus
[55:40] Christ the word of God is being revealed
[55:43] in these last days and the Very purpose
[55:46] of the coming of the revealing of the
[55:48] son of man is to unite the word to the
[55:53] bride the bride is called yes yes sir
[55:57] yes sir we are already
[55:59] called Thank You Lord in that day the
[56:02] son of man will be revealed this is the
[56:05] day that the son of man the word of God
[56:08] is being
[56:09] revealed not the bride in that day the
[56:12] son of man what to join the church stood
[56:15] the head to unite that is the very
[56:17] purpose of the coming or the revealing
[56:19] of the son of man is to reveal the
[56:22] church to the
[56:24] head you the marriage of the Bride so
[56:28] there is an invisible Union between the
[56:31] bridegroom and the bride by the
[56:33] revealing of the son of men Hallelujah
[56:37] the bridegroom call will come right
[56:39] through this when the son of man will
[56:42] come down and come in human flesh to
[56:44] unite the two
[56:46] together the son of man manifest himself
[56:49] in the person of William man bham a son
[56:52] of men that can commit mistake
[56:57] right that's why they say oh I don't
[56:58] believe brother he commit mistake that
[57:01] is true because he is a son of man
[57:03] that's right but the message don't make
[57:06] mistake because it is the son of man the
[57:09] Lord Jesus Christ revealed his word made
[57:12] manifest using the mouth of a and
[57:15] aen that's why we need to distinguish
[57:17] just like the Lord Jesus Christ he was
[57:20] the fullness of the goded body but when
[57:22] his ministry he will he become a dual
[57:25] person
[57:27] sometime he preach as a
[57:30] father
[57:32] amen when he made the Sam go and see no
[57:35] more and who can forgive
[57:38] sin right it's the father in him that
[57:42] forgive sin but he said when the son is
[57:46] in
[57:47] manifestation Hallelujah he said the son
[57:49] can do nothing within himself except
[57:52] what the father show him amen so we need
[57:55] to distinguish between the operation of
[57:59] God In the Flesh and the Son of God In
[58:01] the
[58:02] Flesh
[58:03] Hallelujah just like brother Brenham
[58:06] this in the son of man Ministry is
[58:08] coming he said th said the Lord th said
[58:10] the
[58:13] Lord never got wrong with
[58:16] that but when a son of man sometime he
[58:20] got
[58:21] discouraged sometime he has
[58:23] disappointment he has Earth AES yes but
[58:27] when the son of man stand Hallelujah who
[58:30] can stand behind him not even sickness
[58:33] not even cancer because it was the son
[58:35] of man and he said the Lord is here who
[58:38] are you speaking about the names it was
[58:41] not brother bam it was the son of man in
[58:45] the body of a son of man Hallelujah so
[58:48] the purpose of the son of man revealing
[58:50] is to unite praise God the
[58:52] groom and the bride thank you Jesus
[58:56] Hallelujah you Lord when the son of man
[58:59] will come down and come in human flesh
[59:01] to unite the two together church has to
[59:03] be the word amen because he is the word
[59:08] hallelujah so we need to recognize that
[59:11] we are a part of the word just like Adam
[59:15] Hallelujah when Adam was being made by
[59:18] thees In the Flesh The Mystery of the
[59:21] other side is still inside of him that's
[59:24] right then God separated
[59:27] e come on Amen and he said you are now
[59:30] bone of my bone and flesh of BL so the
[59:32] church need to be the word because he is
[59:35] the word amen hallelujah if we are the
[59:37] bride we need to be a part of the word
[59:39] of God in these last days
[59:41] that's the church to be the word he is
[59:44] the word and the two unites together and
[59:47] to do that it'll take the manifestation
[59:49] of revealing of the son of
[59:53] men hallelujah hallelujah not the clergy
[59:56] man I don't know do you see what I mean
[59:59] is the son of man Jesus Christ will come
[1:00:02] down in human placees Among Us and will
[1:00:04] make his word so real that it unite the
[1:00:08] church and him as
[1:00:12] one the bride and then she go home in
[1:00:15] the wedding supper amen hallelujah so
[1:00:18] we're now we we are
[1:00:20] waiting for the wedding supper which is
[1:00:23] the rupture because the marriage is
[1:00:26] already take place when the son of man
[1:00:29] made himself manifest In the
[1:00:32] Flesh yes sir prise God we see the
[1:00:35] visitation of God in this generation and
[1:00:38] we are so blessed that we are one of the
[1:00:41] beneficiaries thank you Lord of God's
[1:00:43] sending his bride I will send to you
[1:00:46] Elijah the
[1:00:50] prophet you is
[1:00:52] you don't give it to others that's right
[1:00:55] it's you
[1:00:56] thank you Lord for the blessing thank
[1:00:59] you Lord for your
[1:01:06] faithfulness will come down in human
[1:01:08] Place Among Us and will make his word so
[1:01:11] real that it unite the church and him as
[1:01:13] one the bride and then she go home to
[1:01:16] the wedding
[1:01:18] supper she's already
[1:01:22] United she's already United it's already
[1:01:26] done when you receive the word you are
[1:01:28] already United with Christ hallelujah
[1:01:33] hallelujah we go to the wedding supper
[1:01:36] not to the
[1:01:37] marriage feel your press and
[1:01:40] Sil all the Flesh of Mighty Men because
[1:01:42] the marriage of the Lamb has come but
[1:01:45] the rupture is going to the wedding
[1:01:49] supper hallelujah amen he is speaking of
[1:01:53] the last Trump amen stage of the rupture
[1:01:58] cycle of when our bodies are changed
[1:02:01] from Mortal to
[1:02:02] immortality and we physically leave the
[1:02:05] Earth at the last Trump amen praise the
[1:02:08] Lord when the word here unites with the
[1:02:12] person and they two become one and then
[1:02:15] what does it do then it manifests the
[1:02:17] son of man
[1:02:19] again not the church the the son of men
[1:02:22] the word and the church become one right
[1:02:27] whatever the son of man done he was the
[1:02:30] word the church does the same thing and
[1:02:33] the Propet of the word now is in the
[1:02:35] bride and she knows what he wants done
[1:02:37] with the word because she has th set the
[1:02:40] Lord as brother R said that the word the
[1:02:43] final voice is now in the bride we are
[1:02:46] united
[1:02:48] Hallelujah through marriage in these
[1:02:50] last days yes
[1:02:53] sir just like when AB
[1:02:56] Abraham we we are already United by
[1:02:59] God's grace amen excuse
[1:03:05] me amen this will be an exciting time
[1:03:09] for us when we know who we are that's
[1:03:12] right
[1:03:14] right we have so many trials
[1:03:17] but and
[1:03:19] sometimes we are drawn by the
[1:03:23] trials but nevertheless the word of God
[1:03:26] is in
[1:03:27] you praise the
[1:03:30] Lord Revelation 3:20 behold I stand at
[1:03:33] the door and knock If any man hear my
[1:03:36] voice come and open the door I will come
[1:03:40] into to him and will stap with him and
[1:03:42] he with me that's right we notice here
[1:03:45] that the opening of the door is
[1:03:47] connected to being able to receive the
[1:03:50] truth of this
[1:03:51] hour because Christ knocking was the
[1:03:54] knocking of the fruit of the message of
[1:03:57] this hour so to open the door and let
[1:04:00] Christ in for Fellowship is to receive
[1:04:03] the message of the
[1:04:06] hour and Revelation 10:7 but in the days
[1:04:09] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:04:11] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[1:04:13] God should be finished as he had
[1:04:15] declared to his servants the prophet
[1:04:18] amen so we have wait for seven Church
[1:04:20] ages until the seventh angel could begin
[1:04:23] to sound and God could give us back the
[1:04:26] key that could open the door to
[1:04:29] immortality by giving us access to the
[1:04:32] thought of
[1:04:33] god of what Adam had fellowship with the
[1:04:36] thought of God before the fall began so
[1:04:38] we are now returning back to the
[1:04:43] original so that's why we we just don't
[1:04:46] know him as a Creator but we know him as
[1:04:49] a redeemer amen when you know him as a
[1:04:52] Creator just like Revelation 4 when the
[1:04:55] seven seal was still Clos all those
[1:04:58] illers worship us worship him as a great
[1:05:01] Creator yes
[1:05:04] yes he is a Creator even Angel
[1:05:07] worshiping as a Creator and sometimes if
[1:05:10] we know him just a Creator we can ask
[1:05:13] anything Lord give me this Lord give me
[1:05:17] job Lord give me money Lord give me this
[1:05:20] Lord give me that Lord give me this
[1:05:23] because you are just seeing him as a
[1:05:26] great Creator who provides everything
[1:05:29] yeah but when the seal was open in
[1:05:32] Revelation chap 5 amen hallelujah it be
[1:05:36] the worship is now focused not on the
[1:05:38] Creator but a
[1:05:40] redeemer thank you Lord for you have
[1:05:42] redeemed us going back to the original
[1:05:45] place because the book is a book
[1:05:48] entitled de of a
[1:05:50] redemp at our inheritance where our name
[1:05:53] lays in that book so when they saw it
[1:05:56] they worship him as a redeemer and they
[1:05:59] sing a new
[1:06:02] song song is written by
[1:06:05] inspiration and this new song means new
[1:06:08] revelation that was given to
[1:06:10] them I always said that when I was in
[1:06:14] when I was uh before my conversion I
[1:06:18] love music but music don't love
[1:06:21] me but thank God when I received the
[1:06:23] message of the hour
[1:06:26] I sing a new
[1:06:28] song and I realize that worldly music
[1:06:32] dwell mostly on broken relationship
[1:06:35] that's right of huraches of desperations
[1:06:39] of
[1:06:41] rebellion amen but when the grace of God
[1:06:44] come into my heart I begin to sing a new
[1:06:47] song of Hope of Courage of inspiration
[1:06:50] of Love of
[1:06:53] Mercy that's why when we recognize him
[1:06:56] as a great Redeemer you need to worship
[1:06:58] him because being a redeemer it becomes
[1:07:01] a personal
[1:07:04] relationship and I no longer call you a
[1:07:06] church but I call you a
[1:07:09] bride because we are redeemed back
[1:07:16] again death and mortality entered in men
[1:07:20] when men was separated from The
[1:07:22] Fellowship Of
[1:07:24] God but immortality is restored when
[1:07:28] fellowship with God is restored I
[1:07:31] believe that we are being restored now
[1:07:33] by the opening of the word
[1:07:37] amen in the message conflict between God
[1:07:40] and
[1:07:42] Satan he said into the ark he
[1:07:46] went and when he went into the ark you
[1:07:49] know what God shut the
[1:07:53] door oh my no nobody had to shed it but
[1:07:57] God shed it am that's it remember when
[1:08:00] he heard the word come into the ark come
[1:08:05] up here to John and Jen responded to the
[1:08:09] voice and he entered through that one
[1:08:11] door and God shut the
[1:08:15] door when God shut the door no one can
[1:08:18] open it because when God sealed you
[1:08:21] Satan is being sealed out Hallelujah
[1:08:24] likewise when had open the door no one
[1:08:27] can close it thank you
[1:08:29] Jesus for some of you the door is still
[1:08:33] open those of you who all all of you who
[1:08:36] have not received the call of God yet
[1:08:38] the door is
[1:08:39] open and no one can close it if you are
[1:08:43] the seat of God the door is still open
[1:08:45] for you but if you can come in and God
[1:08:48] shut the door no one can open it
[1:08:51] hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:08:59] amen when God sealed you sealed you
[1:09:02] until the day of your Redemption thank
[1:09:05] you Lord that's our
[1:09:07] consolation praise the Lord just like
[1:09:10] forestation when I shared it to my
[1:09:13] friend an Apostolic Minister I already
[1:09:16] shared it but I want to share it once
[1:09:18] again and I show him the scripture in
[1:09:21] Ephesians
[1:09:22] 1:6 I told him do you believe in
[1:09:26] predestination because the prophet said
[1:09:28] predestination for the Pentecostal are
[1:09:31] really scary for them but since I opened
[1:09:35] the scripture and I said do you believe
[1:09:37] that we are predestinated unto adoption
[1:09:39] by Jesus Christ he cannot say no because
[1:09:42] it was he's reading
[1:09:45] it so what he did is just okay I believe
[1:09:48] it
[1:09:50] predestinated how do you
[1:09:53] know you know that you are pred inated
[1:09:56] if you keep on going to church but if
[1:09:59] you start but if you stop going to
[1:10:02] church that mean that you're are not
[1:10:04] predestinated I thought is that so and
[1:10:08] he gave me another example for example
[1:10:10] you are riding in the
[1:10:12] train and for some reason you fell up on
[1:10:15] the
[1:10:17] train then how can you be predicate when
[1:10:20] you fall up the train and the train will
[1:10:23] leave you right and I told him well let
[1:10:26] me share to you my understanding of pred
[1:10:29] destination according to your
[1:10:33] example and I said well if you're riding
[1:10:36] a train and you fell off from the train
[1:10:39] God will stop the train put you back in
[1:10:41] the train until you reach your
[1:10:44] destination because you are
[1:10:46] predestinated unto adoption no one can
[1:10:49] hinder it just like when God shut the
[1:10:51] door in Noah stand no one can open it
[1:10:54] you will be going to your destination
[1:10:58] praise the
[1:10:59] Lord but here's the powerful statement
[1:11:02] of the
[1:11:04] Prophet listen close when you take God's
[1:11:07] word and follow God's word there's many
[1:11:11] times that after you already done all
[1:11:15] you can do your faith is put to a
[1:11:19] test that's right we believe Hallelujah
[1:11:23] that we are already in yes sir we
[1:11:26] believe all the prophets we do all we
[1:11:27] can to believe the word of God Amen and
[1:11:30] God shout and seal us but the prophet
[1:11:35] said many times that you'd ever already
[1:11:39] done all you can do be prayerful go to
[1:11:42] the church everything that you want to
[1:11:44] do to please the
[1:11:46] Lord all you can do but your faith is
[1:11:49] put to a
[1:11:51] test remember you are already in the ark
[1:11:57] and this is not a test to prove his
[1:12:00] faith this is a test to reveal his
[1:12:04] faith that's right sir because he that
[1:12:08] endureth unto the end will be saved even
[1:12:12] though we're looking for the changing of
[1:12:14] our body our testing does not does not
[1:12:18] stop when we say we are already sealed
[1:12:21] no that's
[1:12:22] right even before the changing maybe a
[1:12:25] few minutes before the Rapture our
[1:12:27] testing is still going
[1:12:31] on Sir amen yes
[1:12:34] sir just like Abraham so I will swing a
[1:12:38] little bit Genesis chapter
[1:12:41] 22 and it came to pass after these
[1:12:43] things that God did tempt Abraham so God
[1:12:47] is tempting or testing Abraham
[1:12:53] right not to prove his faith because God
[1:12:56] already proved his faith chapter 12 up
[1:12:59] to
[1:13:00] 2021 God is already convinced of the
[1:13:03] faith of Abraham that's why he tempted
[1:13:06] once again for the last time he said and
[1:13:09] it came to pass a third this thing that
[1:13:10] God did tempt Abraham and said unto him
[1:13:16] Abraham he said behold here I
[1:13:19] am no
[1:13:21] hesitation because only God changed his
[1:13:24] name from Ab AB to Abraham so when God
[1:13:27] called him Abraham he immediately know
[1:13:30] that it was God calling
[1:13:32] him no Shadows of doubt that's right
[1:13:35] because he has already experienced it
[1:13:37] for how many ups and downs in his life
[1:13:39] but when God allow came in to pass after
[1:13:41] the that God time when he said take now
[1:13:44] thy son thy only
[1:13:46] son amen who he waited for 25
[1:13:51] years come on then maybe another year he
[1:13:55] grew maybe 15 18
[1:13:59] years and Abraham began to
[1:14:02] love Isaac amen but the time has come
[1:14:06] and he said take now thy son thy only
[1:14:08] son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee
[1:14:10] into the land of Moriah and offer him
[1:14:12] therefore a burnt offering upon one of
[1:14:15] the mountains which I will tell thee
[1:14:17] upon one of the
[1:14:18] mountains no
[1:14:21] direct
[1:14:22] right no direct place to
[1:14:26] go at the very end God is still
[1:14:31] testing so we need to be always in
[1:14:35] constant communication with God amen
[1:14:41] amen one of the man and Abraham rose up
[1:14:43] early in the morning and saddled his ass
[1:14:45] and took two of his young men with him
[1:14:48] and isak his son and caved the wood for
[1:14:50] the burnt offering and Rose up and went
[1:14:52] unto the place of which God had told him
[1:14:55] he didn't waste any time that's right
[1:14:59] God didn't tell him the exact place to
[1:15:02] have a he just go by faith whatever the
[1:15:05] Lord leads I will just
[1:15:07] follow amen that's why somebody ask me
[1:15:11] how do you know the will of God well the
[1:15:14] will of God is always in his
[1:15:16] word outside of his word that is not the
[1:15:19] will of
[1:15:20] God because he says seek ye first the
[1:15:23] kingdom of God all these things shall be
[1:15:25] so by faith Abraham goes to a place that
[1:15:28] God told him with no direct place or
[1:15:31] specific place to offer his son just go
[1:15:34] by
[1:15:36] faith and on the third day lifted up his
[1:15:39] eye and saw the place a part up so three
[1:15:43] days journey he had so many times to
[1:15:45] change his mind amen I waed this for 25
[1:15:49] years another 18 years I grow this child
[1:15:52] I become to love him and he is my test
[1:15:55] testimony right yeah that's it of the
[1:15:59] promise of God in my life but
[1:16:01] nevertheless he didn't change his mind
[1:16:04] praise the Lord and Abraham said unto
[1:16:06] his young men abide ye here with the ass
[1:16:09] I and the lad will go Yer and worship
[1:16:12] and come again to you God told him to
[1:16:14] sacrifice his
[1:16:16] son but he told those two lad wait here
[1:16:21] and we will come back that's right
[1:16:23] Hallelujah
[1:16:25] at the very end he was tested of his
[1:16:29] faith God God wants to to to to manifest
[1:16:34] his faith up to the last
[1:16:37] end yes sir he agreed that he will
[1:16:41] sacrifice Isaac but he told the two Lads
[1:16:44] wait here and I'll go and worship God
[1:16:46] and we'll come back amen praise the Lord
[1:16:50] that because Abraham knew that whatever
[1:16:53] happened to ISA
[1:16:56] even if he had killed him upon the
[1:16:58] mountain God would still have had to
[1:17:01] keep his word and bring a nation out of
[1:17:03] Isaac's seed so Abraham knew that
[1:17:07] somehow he would have to return with
[1:17:09] Isaac because the death of Isaac could
[1:17:12] not stop the promise of God inde the I
[1:17:15] Will Bless thee and your seed after your
[1:17:17] seed so even if he killed Isaac God is
[1:17:20] going to raise him up that's right up to
[1:17:23] the last end of the trial just like when
[1:17:25] Noah end into the ark and God shut it up
[1:17:28] to the last minute God is still testing
[1:17:30] him
[1:17:32] amen praise that's why sometimes our
[1:17:35] testings in life oh I've already in the
[1:17:38] message why this happen I pray for
[1:17:40] Financial Freedom why I am being
[1:17:43] down on I pray for healing why it is
[1:17:46] that my family is being I pray for
[1:17:49] safety why there's no
[1:17:50] actually every time you ask God is an
[1:17:54] opposite
[1:17:58] answer and sometimes we feel the
[1:18:01] lukewarmness but we claim that we are
[1:18:04] the
[1:18:06] bride but we cannot deny we are still
[1:18:08] affected by the laress of this L this
[1:18:11] year that's right that's true so we are
[1:18:13] being
[1:18:16] tested and Noah went in he followed the
[1:18:19] will of God and God shut the door behind
[1:18:22] him but it never r for seven more
[1:18:26] days wonder what Noah thought all the
[1:18:29] time in
[1:18:32] there wonder what our thought being the
[1:18:36] Bride of Jesus
[1:18:37] Christ why this happen to me why this
[1:18:40] happen to my children why this happened
[1:18:42] to my family I claim I am a believer the
[1:18:44] word isn't me I speak the word why is
[1:18:46] still
[1:18:48] happening is there any different to Noah
[1:18:51] when God shut the
[1:18:53] door but God still testing him amen but
[1:18:57] the only thing even though we have so
[1:18:59] many trials the only thing we are
[1:19:01] already
[1:19:03] sealed sometimes we forgot that we are
[1:19:06] already sealed so that's why we get
[1:19:08] nervous we get so anxiety what will we
[1:19:11] do what you're already
[1:19:13] sealed just wait because if God promis
[1:19:17] he is obligated to fulfill what he
[1:19:19] promised Hallelujah sometimes we are in
[1:19:22] a hurry to fulfill what we pray
[1:19:26] but God has a better plan because he
[1:19:28] said my thoughts are higher than your
[1:19:30] thoughts and my ways are better than
[1:19:32] your
[1:19:34] ways patience is
[1:19:39] virtue Noah sitting in the ark on the
[1:19:42] door shut he thought just anytime
[1:19:44] children you'll hear will so he's
[1:19:47] speaking to the children now that the
[1:19:49] door was shut anytime soon my brother
[1:19:51] and sister my son and sister we we will
[1:19:55] hear the pouring out of
[1:19:57] brain they were so excited
[1:20:01] Hallelujah will pull the door and LD up
[1:20:04] here on top and they was up on the top
[1:20:06] floor you know the animals on the bottom
[1:20:08] the bridge the next and they see the Sun
[1:20:10] and oh the morning there will be
[1:20:11] something over there dark and the rain
[1:20:13] will come but the next morning up come
[1:20:17] the
[1:20:18] Sun what a great
[1:20:21] disappointment oh the ruptor is coming
[1:20:23] the ruptor is coming the r is coming but
[1:20:25] when they come up to the third
[1:20:28] floor and when they open the lead of the
[1:20:31] door the sun is coming
[1:20:35] up amen preach
[1:20:39] it their faith is put to
[1:20:42] test not to prove his faith but to
[1:20:46] reveal his faith amen yes sir until
[1:20:50] when he will hold to the promise of God
[1:20:54] Amen
[1:20:57] and maybe some people that kind of
[1:21:00] halfway believe Noah might went up there
[1:21:02] and stood around the ark and they said
[1:21:04] you know what that old man might have
[1:21:05] been right we'd better stand
[1:21:12] here when then they seen a
[1:21:15] mistake they seen a mistake because they
[1:21:18] didn't happen just as what Noah is
[1:21:20] preaching he preached for 120 years but
[1:21:24] when the door was
[1:21:26] shut people are waiting yeah for the
[1:21:30] flood to come and there's no
[1:21:32] flood and they become to sculp become to
[1:21:35] ridicule oh this is fake
[1:21:38] Prophet have we been hearing this in our
[1:21:41] day oh this is false prophet didn't come
[1:21:43] to pass he he made commit
[1:21:46] mistakes but the prophet
[1:21:49] said they seen a mistake God's prophets
[1:21:53] make no mistake
[1:21:56] and God's word Can't Fail Hallelujah
[1:21:59] remember that my brother and sister we
[1:22:01] can fail as a you the flesh but the word
[1:22:04] of God will never fail because what he
[1:22:06] promis is able to perform it there's
[1:22:10] always a test in the message absolute
[1:22:12] God said and God gave Noah trial
[1:22:14] accepting his absolute yes yes no went
[1:22:19] into the ark God shut the door behind
[1:22:22] him no doubt they said now in the
[1:22:23] morning the be black out and there'll be
[1:22:25] thunder and lightning and rain will fall
[1:22:27] but you know the next day the sun come
[1:22:29] up just as bright as it ever
[1:22:32] did yeah look at
[1:22:36] that sometimes it happened to us oh we
[1:22:39] are already sealed we are already
[1:22:41] bride but when Trouble Comes sometimes
[1:22:46] we doubt Our Testimony amen maybe I'm
[1:22:50] not the bride after all because this
[1:22:53] twice and testing it seems I cannot go
[1:22:56] or move
[1:22:58] on but the prophet said Remember the
[1:23:01] door was already shut and God put a test
[1:23:04] in it praise the
[1:23:10] Lord praise God
[1:23:15] Amen and God gave Noah a trial after
[1:23:19] accepting his absolute no went into the
[1:23:22] ark God shut the door behind him no
[1:23:23] doubt they said now in the morning
[1:23:25] there'll be black clouds and there been
[1:23:27] Thunders and lightning and rains will
[1:23:29] fall but you know the next day the sun
[1:23:31] come up just as bright as it ever did
[1:23:34] but then the second day the sun was just
[1:23:36] bright as it was third fourth six and
[1:23:39] even the seventh
[1:23:43] day but Noah had climbed up in the upper
[1:23:48] room instead of going down instead of
[1:23:51] opening the door he climbed up on the
[1:23:53] top am he let his faith rise
[1:23:57] up amen he didn't do the PD party he
[1:24:02] didn't wait for seven
[1:24:04] days he went up hear the voice come up
[1:24:07] here again come up
[1:24:09] Noah amen he waited for seven days he
[1:24:13] wait for seven Church ages then a voice
[1:24:15] came come up here
[1:24:18] johnise Lord and on the seventh morning
[1:24:21] when there come a time when people had
[1:24:23] refused God's abs abolute the way of
[1:24:25] salvation of saving the lives of people
[1:24:28] then rains begin to fall and the sewer f
[1:24:31] up and the boat be to rise and it took
[1:24:34] Noah and D to safety sure because they
[1:24:38] were trusting in God's word the absolute
[1:24:41] God's Word of Promise Amen in verse 75
[1:24:44] he said no matter how bad it seems like
[1:24:47] and how dark it gets still believe your
[1:24:51] [Applause]
[1:24:52] absolute amen
[1:24:55] Hallelujah that's why the greatest trial
[1:24:57] is in our day that's right but God
[1:25:00] already shut you up or seal you up the
[1:25:03] trial is only to show your faith in this
[1:25:06] absolute word of God in Hebrew 10:23 let
[1:25:10] us hold fast the profession of our faith
[1:25:13] without
[1:25:14] wavering for he is faithful that
[1:25:19] promise Thessalonian 5:21 prove all
[1:25:23] things hold fast that which is good what
[1:25:26] is good the opening of the word there's
[1:25:28] nothing good about the opening of the
[1:25:30] word opening of the word that make me
[1:25:33] understand who I am in the program in
[1:25:35] the mind of God Amen and I personally
[1:25:38] believe that at the end it will look
[1:25:40] like for a while that this message had
[1:25:43] failed
[1:25:46] on some has been in the message for 20
[1:25:49] 30
[1:25:50] years B then you'll just hear that they
[1:25:54] just turn away from the message of
[1:25:57] the and they said there's really nothing
[1:26:00] in the message of the it's just like an
[1:26:02] ordinary just like everybody else the
[1:26:05] prophet Comm make mistakes and all of
[1:26:07] that all all the
[1:26:09] comments but for the Bride of Jesus
[1:26:12] Christ this is real because we are not
[1:26:15] following a son of man but we are
[1:26:18] following the son of man even they say
[1:26:22] that what they saying is true even if we
[1:26:25] say that they what saying is true that
[1:26:27] the prophet commit mistakes I was not
[1:26:30] converted because of the person of
[1:26:33] brother BR I was converted because he
[1:26:36] introduced me to the son of man which is
[1:26:39] the word of God and even the prophet
[1:26:42] don't make me as your absolute my
[1:26:44] absolute is the word of God in this last
[1:26:47] days I am said valuable but the word is
[1:26:53] infallible cannot commit mistakes that's
[1:26:56] why we have confidence in his
[1:26:57] faithfulness in our day our trial is to
[1:27:01] prove what he invest in our
[1:27:05] heart amen every time he put a
[1:27:09] revelation he will test that Revelation
[1:27:12] if that Revelation really come from
[1:27:15] God but if you say if you have a
[1:27:18] revelation it come from a man it will be
[1:27:22] tested it will be
[1:27:25] proven and that Revelation if is just
[1:27:28] your own
[1:27:30] Revelation you will turn away from the
[1:27:33] message that's right that's right but
[1:27:35] when the rebel struck your heart God is
[1:27:38] going to prove it that it was really his
[1:27:41] Revelation that was given to you praise
[1:27:44] the Lord just like Cain when God
[1:27:48] revealed to Cain the revelation of the
[1:27:51] sacrifice what Cain expressed was the
[1:27:54] revelation of God he offered to God and
[1:27:57] God accepted it but C he offered a
[1:28:02] sacrifice to the altar according to his
[1:28:06] Revelation and when the time come God
[1:28:09] did accept it but God is so gracious if
[1:28:13] you do what your brother do I will
[1:28:15] accept your sacrifice but he didn't
[1:28:17] accept it because he has no part in it
[1:28:20] that's right
[1:28:24] hallelujah amen no one is family sat and
[1:28:28] after seven hot days of this you can
[1:28:30] imagine what it must have been like for
[1:28:32] them to wait and wait and
[1:28:34] wait there is a waiting time there is a
[1:28:37] testing time that's
[1:28:40] right amen this message is realistic or
[1:28:45] real in our lives amen this is not just
[1:28:48] like a pav that we made a story will be
[1:28:50] interrupt no this is real Battle River
[1:28:54] Revelation upon
[1:28:57] revelation of the word of God in Exodus
[1:28:59] 19:1
[1:29:01] 16 and it came to pass on the third day
[1:29:04] in the morning that there were Thunders
[1:29:06] and Lightnings and a thick Cloud upon
[1:29:08] the mount and the voice of the trumpet
[1:29:11] exceedingly loud so that the people that
[1:29:13] was in the camp
[1:29:16] trembled notice not a third day but a
[1:29:20] cloud amen a cloud and the voice of the
[1:29:24] trumpet we have seen a cloud and have
[1:29:26] heard the voice of a trumpet in this
[1:29:28] hour praise the Lord amen Revelation 41
[1:29:31] and I and after this I look and behold
[1:29:33] the door was open in heaven and the
[1:29:35] first voice which I heard was as it were
[1:29:39] of a trumpet talking with me which have
[1:29:43] come up hither into there and I will
[1:29:46] show the things which must be herea
[1:29:49] there is a cloud there is a thundering
[1:29:52] there is a trumpet and in Noah's day we
[1:29:54] know that it was around the time of when
[1:29:56] the door was being shut that the
[1:29:58] mysterious Cloud appeared in the sky
[1:30:01] just as we have seen the same mysterious
[1:30:04] Cloud appearing in this day so this is
[1:30:07] not a
[1:30:08] coincidence that the mysterious Cloud
[1:30:13] appeared February 28 1963 and we know
[1:30:16] that the appearing of the cloud in
[1:30:18] Noah's day was a sign of
[1:30:20] judgment to that generation just as it
[1:30:24] was in this generation amen because the
[1:30:28] judge of all is already coming down a
[1:30:32] white wig but to no one is
[1:30:35] group it was a sign of
[1:30:39] redemption Amen to those who don't
[1:30:42] accept to the to the to the word of Noah
[1:30:45] it is a judgment but for no one is group
[1:30:49] it was a Redemption time that's right
[1:30:51] prise amen Redemption for them that
[1:30:54] believe in the prophet message for that
[1:30:56] hour so the same door that shut in no
[1:30:58] one is group but the same door that also
[1:31:01] gave them access into the new world
[1:31:04] after the Judgment had passed amen
[1:31:07] hallelujah
[1:31:10] amen Revelation 3:20 again I would like
[1:31:13] to read
[1:31:17] it and behold I stand at the door and
[1:31:20] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[1:31:23] the door I will come into him and will
[1:31:25] stop with him and he with
[1:31:28] me if any man hear my
[1:31:34] voice his personal message to the church
[1:31:38] that's right if any man this is now an
[1:31:41] individual amen yes sir you must first

[1:31:53] with God
[1:31:56] as of Adam had before the fall because
[1:31:58] the same mind that was in Christ is now
[1:32:01] becoming clear to our mind and
[1:32:05] thoughts thank you Lord what was
[1:32:07] revealed to Adam is now being revealed
[1:32:10] unto us amen amen that we are not
[1:32:15] another part of God but we are a part of

[1:32:28] is an evening time meal right it's
[1:32:31] fellowship with Christ is the invisible
[1:32:33] Union of the bride of Christ of being
[1:32:36] united together by the word of this hour
[1:32:39] it's just like the bright AGS just like
[1:32:41] Ruth and boas it's back to hien again of
[1:32:44] the fellowship that God and Adam had
[1:32:46] together before the fall because it is
[1:32:48] the restoration time amen God was

[1:33:36] Door to them who have heard the voice of
[1:33:38] the word of this hour and have received
[1:33:39] the truth of this age into their mind

[1:37:35] the very purpose of God's coming
[1:37:37] Hallelujah the seven seal was open to
[1:37:40] God there he's subject unto himself
[1:37:43] which is the Bride of Jesus Christ the
