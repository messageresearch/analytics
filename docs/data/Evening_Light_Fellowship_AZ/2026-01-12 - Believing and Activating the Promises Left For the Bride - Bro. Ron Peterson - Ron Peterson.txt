Brother will be ready to sing behind you, please. Good morning. &gt;&gt; So yesterday we had sitting in the living room and Aaron and I we were had my guitar and we were and I've been singing that song last few weeks. I've never been this homesick before. And uh my wife asked me this morning. She said, "Well, what are you going to sing?" I said, "I'm going to sing I've never been this homesick before." And on the way to church, I was driving along and you know, just thinking about what God brought you through and and I thought, you know what, thought come on heart said, when I get to church, if brother Justin knows the song When God ran, I'm going to do that. And sure enough, I got back in the room, he said, "Sure, I know it." And then, Brother Robert comes up here and sings the chorus. Never been this homesick before. And I said, "Well, Lord, you know what's going on." &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. That's right. &gt;&gt; But I think at one time or another in all of our lives, we have been that prodal in some way or another. Maybe in different depths. Maybe maybe some of us have went further than others, but at one way or another, I think the words of this song may speak to us in many ways. And I was asked some time ago said, "Brother James, how'd you how'd you get back?" back and I said, "Wasn't by myself." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If he hadn't run and come and got me, I don't think I could have made it home. &gt;&gt; That's right. Almighty God, the great I am, unmovable rock, omnipotent, powerful, awesome Lord, victorious warrior, commanding king of kings, mighty conqueror, And the only time, the only time I ever saw him run was when he ran to me, took me in his arms, held my head to his chest, said, "My son's come home again." Lifted my face, wiped the tears from my eyes with forgiveness in his voice. He said, "Son, do you know I still love you?" And he caught me by surprise when God ran. The day I left home, I knew I'd broken his heart. And I wondered then if things would ever be the same. Then one night I remembered his love for me. And down that dusty road ahead I could see. It was the only time. It was the only time I ever saw him run. And then he ran to me, took me in his arms, held my head to his chest, said, "My son's come home again." Lifted my face, wiped the tears from my eyes with forgiveness in his voice. He said, "Son, do you know I still love you?" He caught me by surprise. He brought me to my knees. When God ran, I saw him run to me. I was so ashamed. All alone and so far away. But now I know that he's been waiting for this day. ran to me, took me in his arms, held my head to his chest, said, "My son's come home again." Lifted my face, wiped the tears from my eyes with forgiveness in his voice. He said, "Son, do you know I still love you?" He caught me by surprise when God ran. And God bless you saints. Praise the Lord. I I um I was also praying trying to find the lead leading of the Lord on what we would sing. So there's many needs amongst us, Brother Robert. Many of us that have healing in our body that we need. There's many of us that have a spiritual need, but I believe that there's a God that can make a way for you this morning. I believe if you're down in the deepest valley, there's a God that can make a way where there seemed there was no way. When a doctor said you could never get out of your condition, there's a God this morning that's the same yesterday, today, and forever for you this morning, his bride. Amen. You can sing this with me this morning. looking for answers. You need a way out. You've been trapped in that trial, full of sorrow and doubt. You saw a trickle of sunlight, but you found no escape. But little bride, just hold on to his promises. He said that he'd make a way. Oh, he'll make a way. In the middle of nowhere, when it seems no one really cares, but he's there by your side. Oh yes, and he'll make a way. When you feel Satan closing, don't give up. Don't give in. He'll make a way right on time. Standing at the Red Sea, there is no place to go. Satan's army, it is closing in and you'll soon overthrow. But right out of nowhere, there comes a mighty strong hand. He'll roll back your waters. He'll make a way out again. Oh, he'll make a way in the middle of nowhere. I believe it this morning when it seems no one really cares, but he's there by your side. Oh, he'll make a way when you feel Satan's closing in. Oh, but don't give up. Don't give in. He'll make a way right on time. Sing that with me this morning. Oh yes, he'll make a way in the middle of nowhere in your Red Sea when it seems no one really cares. But he's there by your side. and he'll make a way when you feel Satan closing. Oh, no. Don't you give up. Don't give in. He'll make a way right on time. No, don't you give up. Don't give in, little bride. He'll make a way right on time. Amen. Thank you for that song special, Brother James, Brother Will. Amen. He does make ways. He's a way maker this morning. He's in the house. Let's stand this morning and change the order of the service. &gt;&gt; He's in the house. He's a way maker. &gt;&gt; You got a need he &gt;&gt; that you'd like him to make a way for? If you do, just lift your hand. Say, "Lord, I got a need. I'm coming to your house." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing this as Brother Ron comes today. Amen. Let's sing verse one and let's start there. He's in the house. &gt;&gt; The little girl was lying there. The people over they just laughed at Jesus when she said she's only sleeping. As he took her by the hand, she began to live again. Some began to praise the Lord. Some begin to say there. Now there is darkness. Now there is hope. There's no more now. I will praise his name. Praise his name. He's his. Oh, we were like that little girl in all our sin. But Jesus is his heart of mine and he gave me life again. I am just a house of whoever sins that blessed day. There's a light that shines on him all the world to see. He's in the night to there is light where darkness to me. Oh, there go. I will praise him. Praise him. Praise his name. Come on now. Praise. Praise his name. I will praise his name. Oh, praise his name. He's in the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; He's in the house. Wherever he's at, &gt;&gt; he brings his promises to pass. &gt;&gt; If you have a need, &gt;&gt; you say, "Lord, remember me this morning." Would you lift that hand before him? &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "It takes faith to activate God." &gt;&gt; So that's what we're doing. We're lifting our hands. for saying, "Lord, we can't do it on our own." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need your help. Heavenly Father, as we've raised our petitions, our hands, our needs, whether they are written or unspoken, Father, you know every need, and you're a God that meets every need. You said, "I will be with you, even in you until the end of the world. Cast all your cares upon me because I &gt;&gt; care for you. You are a high priest that can be touched. &gt;&gt; Let faith reach out and touch you. Let each one &gt;&gt; become energized and quickened by the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; that you might work your work of grace in our lives and manifest your life inside of us. Father, it's no longer I that live, but Christ that liveth in me. And the life that I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God, which gave himself for us. Thank you for Calvary. Thank you for the resurrection. Thank you, Father, for your blood. Thank you for your word. I pray now that you will bless each and everyone, each one that is here. May you grant to them a great victory. I ask in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. Let's just remain standing. Thank you musicians. I appreciate it each and everyone. song specials. They're always very, very special. Amen. God puts it on the heart of someone to sing a song special. Sometimes people get a word from a song special. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes people receive something because somebody was led of the Lord to sing a song. &gt;&gt; So that's what we do. You just feel led. So as God leads you, what happens? You don't realize there's somebody that had a need and they're calling on God and God puts it on your heart and so you sing the song and God gives them what they have need of. &gt;&gt; You might already be healed. You might already be delivered. There might be because he sent his word and his word heals and delivers the people. Amen. Amen. God bless you all this morning and welcome all of our visitors each and every one. and I am not going to take the time for fear that I might miss someone also. But you know who you are and we welcome you in the name of the Lord. But to our local group, we say God bless you to our faithfuls here. Um we greatly appreciate you. I want to just say as I get into this service this morning, okay, I've been very very quickened in the last several weeks to understand the day in the hour in which we live that we might activate the promises for this hour. Okay? Because that's our inheritance. But it's got to be done by faith. And faith is a revelation. And God reveals to you. Brother Brandham said, "The bride will catch the revelation of the rapture &gt;&gt; because it's a revelation to her." &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you believe that this revelation is ongoing? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that you come up to one place, but then God draws you higher. And I believe right now and I I I will say this and make it very well known to you that the bride has come to a turning point. &gt;&gt; You see years ago we we we preached and we would talk about Malachi 4. Hallelujah. Praise God. We talk about Revelation chapter 10. Amen. and the angel and all of this. Well, for years that got the people rejoicing because we recognize that God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; But the time has come to go beyond &gt;&gt; recognizing the prophet to recognizing his message. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; Because praise God, God sent a sign. But what did the sign say? What is happening &gt;&gt; to us? &gt;&gt; What's going on right now? I want to know the promises for this hour &gt;&gt; that it might be quickened to me that I might know my position because if I know my position, I have power and authority with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very good. And I am doing the very best that I can to endeavor to keep the peace of the unity of the spirit. &gt;&gt; That's not easy at times, especially with siblings. I'm talking to the family of God because sometimes you have sibling rivalry. It just happens. All of you that have children, they all come from the same mom and dad, but for some reason, you know, they they sit close and went, "Don't touch me. Leave me alone, Mom. He did it. He touched me." See, and and you got little things. And there are sometimes you have little issues with people and you know, you don't maybe not get along. Well, uh, understand that, uh, when you have the spirit of Christ, okay, uh, you learn to get along. &gt;&gt; What if the one that you have had an issue with for years is the one his mansion is next to you in glory? &gt;&gt; You going to build a bigger fence? You going to put curtains on your house so you can't look into his? Hey, I believe saints of God that we have come to a turning point. I believe that the bride right now and understand this is not something exclusive to evening light fellowship. &gt;&gt; It is not something that is just happening here and we're we're we're saying that we have it and others are missing it. No, I'm saying that the bride of Jesus Christ is coming into an understanding. Amen. &gt;&gt; She is being quickened at this very moment. &gt;&gt; And it's not an orchestration of man. It is not coming to us by carnal knowledge and carnal understanding. &gt;&gt; But we are coming into a higher dimension. And the Lord willing, I will probably preach that here in the next service or two when I I speak is I want to I want to make you acutely aware of another dimension. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I want you to aware that there is another reality that is far greater &gt;&gt; in the unseen realm &gt;&gt; than what you see with your eye. &gt;&gt; So let's not be carnally minded and just get our blinders on and it's it it it's just this. But may God open the eyes of our understanding &gt;&gt; that we might know him. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. All right, let's just remain standing. Turn with me in your Bibles. It's probably one of the most familiar portions of scripture, but I wish to launch off. I'm going to take something in a little bit of a different direction. So, please bear with me this morning. Revelation chap 10. Revelation 10 verses 1- 11. Hallelujah. I love to hear the Bibles being turned. Amen. I trust that this is not the only time you open it. I trust that you open it daily, &gt;&gt; that you pray daily, &gt;&gt; that you seek his face. Because if you will make a move towards God, God will make a move towards you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's you yielding and you getting into it so that God can give you more. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. Revelation chap 10 verses 1- 11. Now this is the prophetic word. &gt;&gt; This is a prophecy that was inspired by John or inspired by God to John and he wrote it. And this has has gone down through the ages. Different ones in different ages read this very same scripture and had no idea of when it would be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; So God has a time and a season for everything. &gt;&gt; And so we must be aware of the time and the season. So brother Brandham preaches to us sermons that declare to us something to to let us know where we're at. And the sermon that just a few weeks ago was just so dynamic to me was the uniting time and sign. &gt;&gt; He actually says this will be the end time seed &gt;&gt; sign. Revelation chap 10 verse 1. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book book open. Notice the book is open. In Revelation chapter 5, there was no one worthy to take the book, neither to look thereon. And John wept. He said, "Weep not, John." &gt;&gt; For the lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that when he heard that the lion had prevailed, he turned to look and what did he see? &gt;&gt; I saw a lamb. He saw God's provided way. He saw a lamb, the same one that Abel saw. &gt;&gt; The revelation keeps growing. &gt;&gt; God, help us to see the lamb. And he had in his hand a little book open, and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roarth. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write. And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, "Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not." John could not write it. Why? It wasn't his time. &gt;&gt; But it is our time. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's why brother Brennham said Revelations 10 1-7 is the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; It's the mystery &gt;&gt; that's been hid down through the ages but is now revealed. &gt;&gt; So we understand that the seventh seal finishes all things. &gt;&gt; It's the end of the struggling world. It's the end of everything. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're at the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This whole world is falling apart. It's got to fall apart. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we have a kingdom which cannot fall apart, which cannot be shook. And so therefore, that kingdom is coming and pressing. &gt;&gt; It's pressing &gt;&gt; to get this kingdom out of the way that the other kingdom &gt;&gt; can come. I say come quickly. &gt;&gt; So it was sealed up then because it wasn't time. Verse five. And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer. They asked brother Brennham when you opened the seals did it end time? He said no time. He says still goes on. When it means that time shall be no longer. It actually if you go to the true translation it said no longer delayed. &gt;&gt; As a woman that comes to the time of giving birth when she gets into her position &gt;&gt; and she's under birth pains. Let me tell you the time can be you can say wait when she's ready to give birth nothing is more important &gt;&gt; the time can be no longer delayed &gt;&gt; get out of the way &gt;&gt; it's coming &gt;&gt; you But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. Notice in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound. And brother Brennham said not when he begins in his first and second pull but when he begins to reveal the word and his ministry changes. How many of you have caught the change of ministry? That's right. &gt;&gt; You you you've understand that the the orchestra has gone an octave higher &gt;&gt; that something has happened. You see, we're being quickened now beyond just being to say the seventh angel has sounded wonderful. But what was that sounding do? &gt;&gt; What will it produce? &gt;&gt; What effect will it have? Amen. &gt;&gt; God, help me to hear &gt;&gt; what the spirit &gt;&gt; is saying unto the church. &gt;&gt; And the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants, the prophets. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, "Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel, which standeth upon the sea, and upon the earth." And I went to the angel, said, "Give me the little book." This was not a polite suggestion. &gt;&gt; It was a command. Give me &gt;&gt; the little book. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says, "You just don't ask." Oh, um, Satan, listen. Uh, you know, you got some inheritance in mind. I want you to give it to me. &gt;&gt; No, he said, "You're going to have to fight for it." And he said, "You're going to have to demand &gt;&gt; that he release it, and you have to claim it and embrace it &gt;&gt; that it's yours." &gt;&gt; How many of you want your inheritance? &gt;&gt; Give me the little book. And he said unto me. So now, one angel speaking to an earthly angel. Give me the little book. and he said unto me, "Take it and eat it up." So now, as he's given the book, he's given instruction. Take it and put it on your shelf. &gt;&gt; Just put it in your library. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; He says, "Take it &gt;&gt; and eat it up. and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand. So now watch this very closely. Now the angel says, "Take the little book and eat it." John then had to go and physically take it. You have a responsibility with this message that has been given to you in this hour. &gt;&gt; Take it. &gt;&gt; It's yours. &gt;&gt; Don't accumulate it. &gt;&gt; Eat it. &gt;&gt; Take it. Say it's mine. Then I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings." I want you to be aware of who is speaking and what voice is quickening the other one to take and to eat. And so we see the mighty angel coming down from heaven. He's a heavenly angel. Who is that? That's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He's coming to an angel messenger. Messenger is also an angel here. One who receives a message and he says take the book. &gt;&gt; Now understand the voice is giving instruction. &gt;&gt; Can you receive instruction this morning? Because it's not just taking it, but taking it and eating it because it's now going to create in the ministry of the final voice. &gt;&gt; John being a type of the bride of Christ, &gt;&gt; take it, eat it, because thou &gt;&gt; must prophesy. &gt;&gt; You say, well, I thought that's just the prophet of the hour. I will give you a quote. The prophet of God said, "The prophet of every hour is the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'll ride the trail one more time." It's a promise. &gt;&gt; Can you receive that? &gt;&gt; I believe what God is doing. &gt;&gt; He's riding the trail again. Yet he's immorpha. &gt;&gt; He's changing his mask. &gt;&gt; He went from a one prophet messenger &gt;&gt; to a mystical body to a multi-membered body. &gt;&gt; That they would come from here and there. They would come from all kinds of backgrounds. That's right. &gt;&gt; You would have all kinds of things in your life and wonder, "How did you get where you're at today? How is it that you received it?" Let me tell you, God is determined to save you. &gt;&gt; You did not go hunting for this message. &gt;&gt; He came hunting for you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He ran to you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, now in the name of Jesus Christ, I ask a great anointing be upon us, not only on the speaker, but upon every hearer, quicken us, Father, under the promises for this hour that we might take our position that we might have power and authority with God. I ask it for your glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. being seated in the presence of God. The voice continues, "Eating the revealed open book caused the quickening power." John was quickened by what he was eating. &gt;&gt; And I want to declare unto you that if you say you're eating of this message, I want to ask, are you being quickened to it? &gt;&gt; Is your understanding greater now than when it first come to you? Is it unfolding? &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says, "Watch this unfolding." Because what God has done in every age, he said, "Don't put a period and stop there." Because God wants to add under your faith. Virtue, virtue, knowledge, knowledge, temperance. &gt;&gt; It's continuing. Let me tell you, it's continuing. Now, &gt;&gt; the voice of God did not stop with the death of the seventh angel messenger. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennan says, "You can silence the messenger. You can put him in the grave, but the voice continues. &gt;&gt; How many of you can say amen to that? It continues. You know where it continues? In me &gt;&gt; and in you. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the very same voice that was in him &gt;&gt; is now in you. &gt;&gt; The very mystery &gt;&gt; of Christ himself &gt;&gt; is now being unveiled. Listen, it took the seventh angel &gt;&gt; in this hour to find a bride. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it was his ministry that unveiled her. &gt;&gt; It was his ministry that unveiled you. &gt;&gt; And then you realized &gt;&gt; what God was doing with that seventh angel is he was choosing a bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you took it so personal. &gt;&gt; It must be personal. &gt;&gt; Don't you dare pass it off to someone else. &gt;&gt; Don't be foolish. &gt;&gt; That angel is powerless to bring you to a position of authority until you embrace the promise and you agree with his message. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you do, &gt;&gt; there's a quickening power. When Mary said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." &gt;&gt; The angel then could leave. I've done my job. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, Malachi 4 could not go off of the scene until he had done his job. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. John was changing dimensions. Immediately when John was quickened by the Holy Spirit, come up hither. &gt;&gt; He w he he was to transition from where he was to a higher dimension. Brother Brennham said, "Revelation is actually a transitioning power. &gt;&gt; It's taking you from where you are &gt;&gt; to where you want to be. &gt;&gt; So, it's continuing. This mystery is being unveiled and you're a part of it. &gt;&gt; The bride is becoming unveiled. &gt;&gt; And you've all been to the weddings with the bride and here she comes ushered in. Let me tell you, the wedding is not about the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; They don't all stand when he comes in. &gt;&gt; Because he chose a woman. &gt;&gt; And because of that choosing and because of her acceptance, now there's a union taking place. &gt;&gt; And she was being ushered in. And as she's ushered in, The family recognizes there's a changing taking place. A union is about to take place. And the mother stands and turns and look the crescendo. &gt;&gt; Here comes the bride. &gt;&gt; She's being ushered in by the father. This ushering in takes some time. &gt;&gt; It's her day. &gt;&gt; It's her hour. &gt;&gt; This is all about her. &gt;&gt; Who giveth this woman &gt;&gt; to be married to this man? Who allows this union? gives her away and then he is the only one that removes the veil. And he doesn't just take it here and just flippantly. No, he takes it just like we saw in the last in December. We had two weddings. But you see, I love to see when he takes it and he does it slowly &gt;&gt; like this and she every time he takes it higher, she gets a a greater smile. &gt;&gt; There's an expectation. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? The groom unveils the bride. It wasn't Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; He's just the vessel. &gt;&gt; He's only the voice. &gt;&gt; But the unveiling was being done by God himself. &gt;&gt; And it's still going on right now. &gt;&gt; Because until that last one comes in and recognizes who she is, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. We're in that season. Revelation is the power of transformation. We walk not by faith but by sight. Excuse me. We walk not by sight but by faith. It's not what you seek. Too much of the time we are hindered from seeing what God is doing with carnal eyes. Revelation therefore then is coming to a higher dimension. It will require supernatural instruction. Not comparing verse verse. That's good. That's nice. &gt;&gt; But for you to be able to actually be quickened to the place where you receive supernatural instruction. I want to title my sermon this morning and and and and follow along with me because I I've got many pages of notes, but I don't want to be in a hurry believing and activating the promises left for the bride. I want to know what is left and expected for the bride to fulfill. I don't want to take the subject of say what the word says and say what the tapes say. There is to be a ministry of the bride in this end time. And to deny her her ministry is to deny the word. &gt;&gt; Are we together on that? &gt;&gt; It is to not just press play. It is to press play and obey. Say what the tapes say. &gt;&gt; Don't just take isolated quotes and stop. &gt;&gt; Keep going. &gt;&gt; Why? It's still unfolding. &gt;&gt; The end time seed sign has been recognized by the bride and the prophet was the sign to bring about a union with the groom. Ezar never courted Rebecca. &gt;&gt; He didn't expect her to fall in love with him. &gt;&gt; But his message was, I'm bringing you to the one. I'm just a messenger. &gt;&gt; I'm bringing you to him. How many of you believe that this prophet messenger is bringing you to the groom? &gt;&gt; That's him. That was his job. &gt;&gt; Not for you to fall in love with him. Not to for you to just get enamored and everything by the messenger. Brother Brham said, "I'm just a voice." &gt;&gt; I'm just an instrument being used of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We have recognized the Elijah ministry for our day and he and he alone. Now, I want to make this extremely clear. I believe that there is but one voice that God has ordained to turn our hearts back &gt;&gt; and that was through the ministry of the seventh angel messenger. How many of you know that's what I preach and I teach? &gt;&gt; We do not replace him. We do not say, "Well, that's over. That's done with." No, it continues. &gt;&gt; It's an ongoing message. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brennham is a typologist and he says, "I look for patterns within the word." And he says, "Therefore, I look and see what has been will show me what will be. For as it was, so shall it be." Because God doesn't change his pattern. &gt;&gt; Watch in sian church age. In every age, we have exactly the same pattern. &gt;&gt; Every age. That includes this last one. &gt;&gt; That is why the light comes through some God-given messenger in a certain area. And then from that messenger, there spreads the light through the ministry of others. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just him. &gt;&gt; There is a God-given voice. There is a God-given messenger. &gt;&gt; And through that messenger, there are others who have been faithfully taught. &gt;&gt; But of course, all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken. I'm not interested in men's opinions. I'm not interested in interpretations. God is his own interpreter. If there is a mystery and you don't have the answer, don't try to figure it out. Let it be. &gt;&gt; God brings it to pass. &gt;&gt; And that is the interpretation. &gt;&gt; When he said, "Let there be light and there was light." That was the interpretation. &gt;&gt; When he said, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and she conceived." That was the interpretation. How careful we must be to hear one voice. For the spirit has but one voice, which is the voice of God. Paul warned them to say what he said, even as Peter did. Likewise, he warned them that even he Paul could not change one word of what was given by revelation. Oh, how important it is to hear the voice of God by way of his messengers &gt;&gt; and then &gt;&gt; watch this. And then say what has been given them to say to the churches. &gt;&gt; Do you see it continues? It's not just that messenger, but it is now continuing to from those that have been faithfully taught. Now hold on because I want to bring something to your attenu your attention because much of the time this quote has been misused and abused among message ministry. Revelation of Jesus Christ church age book. Now remember this. Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts. But the book of revelation shows that how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm, formal and powerless. that exposes Satan, &gt;&gt; revealing his works, attempting destruction of God's people, and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire. He fights that, he cannot stand it. He knows that if the people get the true revelation, now this was capitalized by brother Brenam. You'll find it in your church age book. He knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church, so that means that there is a true revelation and a false revelation and that there is a true church and there is a false church. &gt;&gt; So when the true church catches the true revelation and what she is and what she stands for and she can do the greater work. Listen, don't leave it alone with the ministry of the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, the ministry ceased. When he went off the scene, that's it. &gt;&gt; No, it continues. &gt;&gt; And she can do the greater works. She will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; We hear that all the time. Praise God. I tell you, no devil will stand before you. Why? you know, on and on and she's going to be an invincible army. But now watch this disclosure here in the next sentence. If they get the true the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church. In other words, it's coming within the message. &gt;&gt; Deception is not coming from out there. &gt;&gt; Deception within the message. I've showed you quotes where he said that the bride would be doing deceiving by the word. And what he means by that, okay, is that by her interpretation of what he said will deceive the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, be careful who's preaching to you and what they're saying because if they're not saying what the Bible says or if they're not saying what the message says because the message, understand this, &gt;&gt; the message is the clarification of the word. The message is the revealing of the word because the letter in itself &gt;&gt; is dead &gt;&gt; but the quickening of the spirit brings it life. &gt;&gt; He says and by God's spirit discern and withstand. Now there's two spirits within the framework of the church. And he says, "And by God's spirit, you discern and withstand." Those are two actions. You first have to discern it. &gt;&gt; And then you have to withstand it. It's an antichrist spirit. What does Antichrist mean? &gt;&gt; Anti-word. Brother Brandham says, oh, he says, sometimes you think anti-word or antichrist is going to be so obvious. He said, no, it's just a changing of one word. &gt;&gt; He said the spirit would be so close in the end time, it would deceive the very elect if it were possible. &gt;&gt; But he said the reason it's not possible is because the word of God has become the bride's absolute. He said, "Then Satan will be powerless before." &gt;&gt; Let me declare something to you this morning. We have entered into, and brother Brennan declared it, the time of the finished cycle. In other words, everything is going through cycles. There was a cycle of Revelations 10:1, the cycle of the ministry. It was going forth. Brother Bren, let me tell you, brother Brennham was pointing people to go to church. And he said, "The closest ones that I can send you to now are Pentecostals because they believe in the supernatural." But when brother Brandon was declaring, hey, I I've sent 750,000 of my converts to assemblies of God, &gt;&gt; that's what he said. But back then, there were no message churches. &gt;&gt; You have to understand there was no evening light fellowship. There was no end time tabernacle. There was none of there was a few inspired men catching that this ministry was unique. &gt;&gt; There weren't message churches. &gt;&gt; He was sending go to church. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, keep going to church because he knew there would come a time when you needed to be in church. &gt;&gt; You may not even have been called &gt;&gt; at that time. You might not even have heard about it, &gt;&gt; but it never negates going to church. &gt;&gt; Listening to tapes does not replace going to church. &gt;&gt; Although I believe in listening to tapes, &gt;&gt; I try to every day &gt;&gt; and I've done it ever since I was a young man. Since I came into this message, &gt;&gt; it's just continually unfolding. I was in my office in prayer and study and I heard my wife in the kitchen and she's preparing some food and the voice that familiar voice was speaking and I came I walked in I said how beautiful is that voice There's how many of you can say there's something &gt;&gt; about that voice &gt;&gt; because in the days of the voice &gt;&gt; you see everything that God did from Genesis 1 he created with his voice. &gt;&gt; He said let there be light and he spoke it with his voice and when he did that voice created. I want you to understand the voice has a quickening power. The voice is creative. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said through the spoken word of the original seed, he says, "God is creating himself a bride." How did he do it? By speaking the word. &gt;&gt; And the prophet was catching revelation. I'll tell you what, I'm here to preach a sermon today about choosing a bride. And what was he doing? He was he was creating &gt;&gt; the virtues &gt;&gt; and the characteristics what God would look for in a bride. &gt;&gt; Not through beauty. &gt;&gt; Not through Hollywood evangelism. &gt;&gt; He says this little bride, if I can get her to stand still long enough. Okay, Pentecost was to get everybody excited and everything. He said, "Now, now he's here now. Sit still. &gt;&gt; It's not all this jumping and shouting. Although we believe in jumping and shouting, &gt;&gt; but give me something to jump and shout about." &gt;&gt; Pentecost got it all reversed. Well, because we jumped and shout, therefore, we got it. No. Because many times God will say, "Be still &gt;&gt; and know that I am God." &gt;&gt; God had been speaking to Abraham for many ages. You're going to have a son. You're going to bring forth a promised seed. &gt;&gt; And God kept appearing to Abraham. And God appears to Abraham and and he does this. And God appears. And we keep seeing the appearing. And yet there's nothing being appeared unto Sarah. She's just along for the ride. She is a recipient of what God is promising to her husband. &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand the declaration came to Abraham. You're going to have a seed. He can't do it by himself. So, how's that seed going to come? Through his wife Sarah. But Sarah has got to be quickened according to Genesis 11. And Sarah by faith re huh was quickened by faith to conceive seed. And I wonder how many through these years have been listening to the ministry of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 and the conception. Understand it must be Christ in you being birthed. &gt;&gt; That's what you're pregnant with. &gt;&gt; He come to quicken the seed &gt;&gt; to bring forth. He's cloning himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it? This is a mystery that's been hid down through the ages. &gt;&gt; Do you realize all of you sitting here right now, you're a part of the mystery? &gt;&gt; And I will declare that you are a mystery unto yourself. &gt;&gt; You're no different than Mary. How can this be? &gt;&gt; I'm nobody special. &gt;&gt; The angel said, "I disagree with you. You are highly favored." &gt;&gt; That ought to put a smile on somebody's face. That ain't this ain't because &gt;&gt; huh &gt;&gt; that you were so good. &gt;&gt; It wasn't because you kept all the commandments. &gt;&gt; It wasn't. Well, it was because God had a covenant &gt;&gt; to the seed. &gt;&gt; Because that's what this whole thing is about. It's about the seed &gt;&gt; and it's about you. Because if you have the seed inside of you, you were predestinated to hear the promises to be activated in your life for this hour. &gt;&gt; How dare you pass it off to some &gt;&gt; Hagar? &gt;&gt; When it was first told to Sarah, she laughed. Let me say this is no laughing matter. &gt;&gt; It's not a time in our immaturity. &gt;&gt; The days of being immature are over. &gt;&gt; Huh? One saying I'm of Paul and another Apollos. He said, "Are you not just babes in Christ?" Who is Paul and who is Apollos? Are they not just workers? If we're not careful, what we've done is we've divided ourself up within the message until one won't fellowship with another because my daddy's bigger than your daddy. My church is better than your church. &gt;&gt; Stop that. &gt;&gt; I actually now let me let me just say this so you understand. It's not how many people &gt;&gt; that a pastor may be a pastor over it. I actually I actually have a great deep respect of a pastor that's just got 15 or 20 people. I do. You know why? Because when it's just a small group, everybody knows everybody. &gt;&gt; Huh? You know how hard it is as a pastor when you've got just a small little group, a handful, 15, 20 people, and one whole family is sick for that whole week. Boy, do you ever miss them? Where were you? Well, we were sorry we were all sick. Okay. So I have such a respect because it is not the amount. Okay. It's easy to preach with a whole church full of people. In fact, many of you can hide among the multitude. &gt;&gt; But when it's just a handful where there only 15 or 20, you can't hide. I'm talking to you. You see, and then everybody, I know who he's talking about. I know why the pastor said that. Cuz John said this or he did that or she did this. I know he's But here, you can sit. You can come here and if you're not careful, you'll sit here &gt;&gt; and you'll be &gt;&gt; lonely. You will sit there and be unaccounted for. &gt;&gt; Going to church. May I say this? Becoming the church because you are the temple. &gt;&gt; Going to church is far more important than you realize. Because there is going to be times when you come and you got an issue, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; And you need a word and you need God and maybe the pastor don't know nothing what you're going through. &gt;&gt; But all of a sudden he'll go to preaching about something and all of a sudden you're going, "Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How did he know?" &gt;&gt; The father is revealing it. to his servant and his servant speaking it. So you catch the idea that God is mindful of you. &gt;&gt; Oh, pastor, thank you. Thank you. That really helped me. I don't even know what I said that helped you. &gt;&gt; I'm ignorant. I don't know what you have need of, &gt;&gt; but he does. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Those that have an ear to hear will hear what the spirit is saying. See, by revelation, they come under the obedience of that messenger and they line up with the word. Remember one of the final visions, he saw the bride getting out of step and he wakes himself. Get back in line. I believe that this is the time that the spirit is calling out to the bride wherever she be. Stay in line. &gt;&gt; Don't get out of step. Stay in step with the word. &gt;&gt; He's doing it. He's speaking it. &gt;&gt; Stay in line. And when you get in line and you come under the obedience of that messenger's voice, then the voice changes. It continues. It's the same voice in a different vessel. It becomes the final voice. All of you understand Brother Bram is not the final voice. Amen. &gt;&gt; If he was the final voice, then what he said that the ministry of the bride and she would be the final voice to the final age. Then what you do is just well then I guess he's the final voice. So that's it. It's over. It's done with. And we just sit back and we wait until God raptures us. And then you deny the very position that God wants you to get into. Because this Jesus said these works that I do &gt;&gt; didn't stop with him. Didn't stop when he went to Calvary. And when he said it is finished, &gt;&gt; it continues. This message continues. The message believing community is greater in number than it was when he was here. Are you aware of that? &gt;&gt; There were so few in the early 60s that began to catch not just that he he had some kind of prophetic ministry and under first and second pole because that never caught anyone. It caught their attention and they all said, "Oh, he's a great man of God. He does." He said, "Oh, let's wait do more miracles." Come on. We want to see a sign miracles discern and and and opens eyes. I want to ask you the ministry of Jesus Christ after the resurrection. The only miracle that he does in a resurrected form is to open eyes. and the two on the road to Emmus. Emmas means earnest desire. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; All of you understand that had you asked Cleopus and that other disciple several weeks before the crucifixion and you would ask him, "Are you a believer?" Oh yes, guaranteed. I'm 100%. I believe this is the I believe this is the one. I believe this message. I'm all in. But after he was taken and crucified, they entered a state of confusion. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I thought I thought this was the one. And Jesus, understand this, he drew near &gt;&gt; and there was a union. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love this. Their confusion of what God was fulfilling in their hour did not stop the revelation coming to them. Very good. &gt;&gt; Neither will it stop with you. You say, "Well, I I thought this is the message of the hour." If this is the message the hour, ah, I tell you what, why are the people all so broke up? Why is there confusion? Why is one saying this? And why is another saying this and over here and nobody's fellowshipping? Ah, if this is a bride, I don't know. &gt;&gt; All confused. So Jesus, he joined himself. &gt;&gt; You know what God's doing with the bride right now? &gt;&gt; Not because of your revelation. It might be in the midst of your confusion. &gt;&gt; Ah, I don't know what to believe anymore. I thought, asked some of you several years ago. Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is it. My, we're so excited. This is the message of the hour. Rapturing faith. Oh, hallelujah. And then one brings this message and another brings that message and this group gets pulled off here and that group gets pulled off and it divides fellowship and it breeds hatred &gt;&gt; and causes bitterness. &gt;&gt; Those things ought not to be So there in the midst of there all their confusion. So Jesus now Jesus now joins himself. Listen, be spiritual. Now catch this. He makes a union. &gt;&gt; Here's the word revealed in its hour, in its season. Here is the resurrected Christ and he walks and he joins them. And they don't. The Bible says that their eyes were holding. &gt;&gt; I want to say that I believe there are so many message believers that their eyes are still holding. &gt;&gt; They can't really see the forest for the trees. Come on. &gt;&gt; They're looking around at all of the symptoms and all of the issues and they get discouraged and they said, "We thought, &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; we thought this was going to be a great revival." And we saw this one get up and this one, he took this little group and it was all emotion for a while until it just &gt;&gt; What happened to all those people that went off into some kind of ism? The devil will show you everyone that goes off into a tangent and takes the people away and then he'll make you fearful. &gt;&gt; Well, understand he'll he'll take you either way. &gt;&gt; He'll show you those that went too far, &gt;&gt; but he won't show you those who didn't go far enough. He actually said, "Those who call me God have got a greater revelation than those who call me prophet." Wow. Do you understand? Revelation to you is more important than perhaps you realize. And we are entering now a quickening stage among the bride. Okay? &gt;&gt; It's not a church. &gt;&gt; This is not just this building. &gt;&gt; We're talking a body thou hast prepared for me. You were prepared to receive this message. You are the vessel that God was looking after. &gt;&gt; You are the Mary, if you please. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That the angel could not leave until Mary said, "Be it unto me." &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, Malachi 4, Revelations 10:7, could not leave &gt;&gt; until he got hurt &gt;&gt; to agree. &gt;&gt; How many of you say, "I agree." &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have it all figured out. About the time I think I got all figured out, guess what? Along comes something else. I don't know nothing. &gt;&gt; Re &gt;&gt; and I realize more revelation God gives me the less I know. &gt;&gt; Take that &gt;&gt; and filter it for a minute. He said God is so great it will take an eternity &gt;&gt; to reveal himself. So here in this little finite glitch of time &gt;&gt; in loud 26 in surprise Arizona. &gt;&gt; God is still working this out &gt;&gt; and he's working it out with you and he that begun the good work in you is going to finish it. &gt;&gt; You realize you're the mystery. You're a mystery to yourself. Who me? Who am I? &gt;&gt; Who am I? &gt;&gt; Now, do you know God's his own interpreter? &gt;&gt; Do you know that you are the interpretation of this message? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said the bride's going to have certain characteristics, these virtues, and she'll be dressed like this. She will act like this, this will be and on and on on like that. You know what he said? You know he's talking about &gt;&gt; you sitting here this morning &gt;&gt; under the sound of my voice in this congregation right now are the continuation of this prophet's message. May I say it? You're the interpretation. &gt;&gt; Because take away that prophet messenger, there would be no interpretation. But because there is a people in the land who under their prophet, &gt;&gt; they begin to know who they are, take their position, and then they have power and authority. &gt;&gt; People want power and authority without position. Preach, brother. &gt;&gt; Since when do we command God to do anything? &gt;&gt; You see up here, I command in the name of Jesus Christ, loose this man. Well, I listened to a sermon the other day in 1952 and it most all was a discernment line. And brother Brandon was very calm. God bless you, sir. Why? Why? Come closer. He said, that's just him. Now, if God will reveal to me what's wrong with you, would you have faith in God? Oh, I see. I see you have arthritis. Oh, I see this, this, this. Oh, he says, I see there's a woman out there that when I said this about him, you just raised up and yes, sister in the red dress, God. He says, "If God would reveal to me what your problem is, would you receive your healing?" He said, "Yeah, you know what it is." He says, "The very thoughts I'm thinking right now are the thoughts you're thinking." &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; He says, "Yeah, you know what it is? That pain you have?" He says, "Yeah, it's cancer." He said, "Now," he says, "He allowed me to say that. Would you believe me to be God's prophet?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you would. Would you believe me that the same one that is revealing to me what you have is here telling you, "Have faith in God." That's right. He said, "Oh, I see. I see you've entered. Yes. He says, did you feel that that quickening power come over you? &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. He says you're healed. &gt;&gt; Go your way. And it wasn't no big prayer line. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was simply, do you believe? &gt;&gt; Many of you, you have needs. Have faith in God. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but my need is great. Since when is your need greater than the needs that are the people before you? &gt;&gt; It is. Did you know that your need is what brings him on the scene? &gt;&gt; You have a need. You call upon God. So God sends a spirit of one of the seven redemptive names of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; You have need of healing. I'm Jehovah &gt;&gt; Rafa. &gt;&gt; I'm the God that heals all of your diseases. &gt;&gt; Oh, you have a need. I see that need. He said he's a God that provides all the needs. His name is Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; He provides in every need. You realize out of those seven redemptive names of God that every need you will ever go through, &gt;&gt; all you have to do is say one of those names holds within it the key &gt;&gt; of what I have need of. And when I call on him, &gt;&gt; he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He's Jehovah Cano. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I have need of peace. I'm in a midst of trouble and trials. &gt;&gt; I'm in a quandry. I'm confused. And in the midst, he can anoint you and say, "Peace." &gt;&gt; Peace I give unto you. Not as the world gives. &gt;&gt; I'm Jehovah. Shalom. Oh. Yeah, that's okay. I'm going to just go a little bit further &gt;&gt; in the invisible union of the bride of Christ. Brother Brennham says, "He, the bridegroom, took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life. That's what the Bible said. Your first husband that you were married to. Now, follow along with this. Now, I'm going to I'm going to say something here. I'm going to throw you a curveball. Christ can only marry a virgin. &gt;&gt; Not a forgiven woman. &gt;&gt; That's right. He's a high priest. &gt;&gt; And according to Leviticus 21, a high priest must marry a virgin, &gt;&gt; not defiled in any way, untouched. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham goes so far as to say, "Your first husband, you were married to the world. You were born in sin, shaped in iniquity, came into the world speaking nothing but truth. &gt;&gt; What was it? &gt;&gt; Lies. Lies. Lies. Nobody had to teach you how to lie. You knew it from your little childhood. Did you get into that cake? No. Not me, mama. And you got frosting all over your face and all over your hand. And you sit there and mama said, "Did you get into that cake?" No, I didn't. And you look and you can see the evidences all over. I want all of you to to know that you were born in sin, shaped in iniquity. You were adulterators, fornicators, idoltors. &gt;&gt; You were gentile doves. &gt;&gt; Full of blasphemy, full of adultery. &gt;&gt; You were undone. You needed a savior. Then how could you ever be his bride? &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; You were already married to a first husband. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Satan who had to rule over you. &gt;&gt; Your first husband. This is what he said. &gt;&gt; Your first husband. He says that's what the he he says the bridegroom that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world anointed then he goes into the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you has washed you by the washing of the water. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now understand that when he does something, he does it well. &gt;&gt; By the church congregation said, "No, &gt;&gt; that don't sound right, does it?" You might find that in the almanac, but not in God's Bible. You are standing. No, no, wait a second. He cannot marry a forgiven woman. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She's got to be a virgin bride. You are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning. That is my message to the church now. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You are standing. If you're standing in God's word with God's word, every amen, every jot, every tit, &gt;&gt; where are you standing? I'm trying to tell you, &gt;&gt; pull away from them shocks. Get out here in the wheat &gt;&gt; where you can get right before the sun. I hear the coming of the combine. You're standing complete, justified like you never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Talk about a thanksgiving. I feel real good. &gt;&gt; You are the pure now. Now watch. He's speaking the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. You are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son of the living God. Every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God, washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God, stands as though you never sinned at the first place. You are perfect. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm gonna skip just a little bit. I just I want to fast forward. &gt;&gt; I want to come to a good part. It's all good, &gt;&gt; but I don't want to bog you down. Brother Brandham said in marriage and divorce, now he now this is one of those sermons that he said. Now, he said, "I want to bring to you the truth on marriage and divorce." Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "The reason we've got ministers and good people that's been married four and five times is because they went into it wrong and they were under misconstrued theology." &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. Understand this. Now, I'm going to lay a precedent here. No minister can marry a woman who's been touched by men. &gt;&gt; Not a forgiven woman. not a divorced woman, &gt;&gt; adulteress, &gt;&gt; but your union to your husband, Christ the word is what cleanses you. The blood sanctifies the defiled woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, in marriage and divorce, brother said there is no minister that can marry a widow. &gt;&gt; Did you know that? You want to read that? All right, let's go to Leviticus chapter 21. And I'll tell you, if you go to Leviticus chapter 21 and you read from verse 7 to verse 14, you will find out. He says, "No minister can marry a widow, a woman that's been touched, &gt;&gt; anything. She's got to be a virgin &gt;&gt; bride. &gt;&gt; Then he goes Ezekiel 42:44 priesthood was to not marry a woman that's been touched by man. This type of the virgin bride of Christ of Jesus Christ because they handle the fire of God. The priesthood Aaron's sons. &gt;&gt; They could not marry another woman and a woman been touched by a man. showing in type here if you want to see it that the church of the living God is purely unadulterated the word of God and not even a denomination that's been handled by men. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that the union that you have with your kinsman redeemer can take Rahab Come on. &gt;&gt; Can take Ruth. &gt;&gt; Can take Tamar. &gt;&gt; Do you really realize what happened with Ruth here? Because Naomi had a union with her husband and his name was IMC. And because of financial reasons and economic hardship, IMC took Naomi and they moved with their two daughters, excuse me, two sons and their sons got married. And guess what? The father dies and the and the boys die. Naomi says, "Don't call me Naomi. Call me Mara." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For God hath dealt with me bitterly. &gt;&gt; Naomi, are you listening to me this morning? &gt;&gt; Some of you are saying, "The things that have happened to me are bitter. I can't call myself blessed. I don't understand it. How can you call me Naomi? Call me Mara because the vision doesn't match the reality. &gt;&gt; She talks to Orpa and to Ruth and said, "Why don't you go back?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why don't you go back? I have no more seed to give you. Why didn't you go back? Orpa kissed her mother goodbye. But Ruth, what did she say? &gt;&gt; Watch. Because &gt;&gt; of a verbal communication, &gt;&gt; she activated &gt;&gt; the promises of God with her own mouth. &gt;&gt; Your God &gt;&gt; will be my God. Your people will be my people. Whether thou goest, I will go. And where you die, I will die. So now she has a union &gt;&gt; with Naomi &gt;&gt; because of ach. &gt;&gt; There's an inheritance. &gt;&gt; So Naomi goes back to the land where she has an inheritance. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Boaz the kinsman says, "Who's that working in the field?" &gt;&gt; When he comes to her, who are you? &gt;&gt; Reveal yourself to me. She says, "I'm Ruth the Moabitete." &gt;&gt; The Moabitis was under a curse for 10 generations. Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember preaching that, brother Warren? &gt;&gt; He should have said, "Ain't no way." &gt;&gt; Man, all of a sudden, all this what I thought might be cannot be. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand because of Naomi's relationship to her husband, she has a inheritance through IMC by way of a kinsman redeemer. and Ruth. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because she has joined herself, &gt;&gt; she comes under the same union, &gt;&gt; the same covenant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, had she been married before? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Her husband died. No kids. And yet her union with Boaz, &gt;&gt; are you listening to me? &gt;&gt; Let let this drop very very deep in your heart this morning &gt;&gt; because of your union. Brother Brandham said, "This is the uniting time &gt;&gt; and I am the sign &gt;&gt; and here it is." And this is the end time seed sign. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is a union that's taking place. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this union that you have with your &gt;&gt; husband, Christ the word, &gt;&gt; he cleanses you so far beyond your faults and your failures until you come to the place &gt;&gt; you are perfect. &gt;&gt; You are sinless. Do you realize that this union that's taking place with what we call the message of the hour? Do you realize the message of the hour is Christ? Amen. &gt;&gt; And your mere association with this message brings to it a washing &gt;&gt; of the water by the word &gt;&gt; and by the cleansing of the blood until you're justified. &gt;&gt; Justified. &gt;&gt; Say that again. Say it loud so everybody can hear. &gt;&gt; Justified. &gt;&gt; Justified. You never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; You're justified. &gt;&gt; Justified. &gt;&gt; I never did. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not just forgiven. &gt;&gt; Justified. &gt;&gt; My union with him became so perfect because he's a perfect word. &gt;&gt; I will become a perfect bride. &gt;&gt; Do you realize who you are? Do you realize what this message, what kind of power it's got in it? You realize what it's doing and how it's calling a people. &gt;&gt; You realize that you are the interpretation of this message. &gt;&gt; Without you, there was no need for a messenger. But because there was a need, &gt;&gt; God said, &gt;&gt; "These are the days of Elijah, declaring the word of the Lord." Don't Don't Don't let it just be a song. &gt;&gt; You want to know what an Elijah ministry was like? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. A oneman army. &gt;&gt; 450 false prophets. &gt;&gt; Mount Carmel showdown. I and I alone remain a prophet of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the God that answers by fire. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This message, my brother and sister, is a message of fire. &gt;&gt; Don't play with fire. And the God that answered by fire, let him be God. Do you realize that God has joined with you because of the pillar of fire? Do you know he's consumed your sacrifice? There nothing left. &gt;&gt; I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus. Behold, all things &gt;&gt; are passed away. Behold, all things. Do you realize I'm a new creation? &gt;&gt; Not this first one done over. No, &gt;&gt; he is now creating himself, &gt;&gt; a bride. &gt;&gt; The bride is under the headship of the word. Just as Ezer gave Rebecca garments, a veil, and things to make her ready to meet Isaac, so has the end time messenger giving us a message that's clothing the bride is brother Brandham the final voice. Then anybody who tells you all you have to do is press play and that is the token for the hour is deceiving you &gt;&gt; when you begin to discern and withstand the two spirits within the framework of the church because to just press play and not to obey is a Catholic spirit. You nailed it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Instead of lighting a candle, we'll press play. God never ordained mechanical devices. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say what the tapes say, sir. &gt;&gt; You won't hear them say that. &gt;&gt; Come on. Don't Don't get choked up now. Whoa, brother. You know, hey, I ain't after any special person or thing. It's a spirit. It's a spirit &gt;&gt; and it'll be so close &gt;&gt; to deceive the very elect if possible. &gt;&gt; But you cannot deceive the elect. Why? The word is her absolute. &gt;&gt; So if the voice of the prophet is the only voice and the last voice then there is no voice today. &gt;&gt; So then we got to go back to what the voice was then. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "I won't always be your pastor. Let go listen to the tapes." &gt;&gt; He said, "Find a home church. &gt;&gt; Have a pastor. Pay your tithe. Have a post of duty. Go there and do the That's what he said." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, brother Bram, loud as he in church eight musicians, if you come, I'm going to close. Okay, boy. The church is no longer the mouthpiece of God. It's its own mean mouthpiece. So, God is turning on her. He will confound her through the prophet and through the prophet only. &gt;&gt; Keep reading. Keep reading. &gt;&gt; Don't add to. Don't take away. &gt;&gt; Don't get in front of me. No, you're You know what? I want you to keep reading. &gt;&gt; He will confound her through the prophet and &gt;&gt; the bride. For the voice of God will be in him. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? I'm not taking away from the importance of the prophet because listen, since day one when God opened my ears of understanding that God sent a messenger, I have always said I'm pointing back to that message. But then that message, what does it say? &gt;&gt; Yeah. What does it say? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Keep reading, man. &gt;&gt; Don't stop. &gt;&gt; He will confound her through the prophet and the bride. For the voice of God will be in her. Yes, it is. 4 says in the last chapter of Revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear directly from God as at Pentecost but of course the word bride will be refudiated as it was in the first church age refudiate or repudiate repudiate I didn't know what it was you know brother Ren doesn't use that word that's one of them leave Bill, intellectual words. &gt;&gt; Repudiate. What does repudiate? &gt;&gt; Come on, you English majors. Kayla, what does repudiate mean? That's what I said. I thought I'm going to look it up. What does Webster say? Repudiate. To cast off, to disown, to refuse to have anything to do with, &gt;&gt; right? to refuse to acknowledge, accept or to pay. The synonyms are to spurn, reject, and decline. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So this last day voice will be repudiated, rejected, spurned, &gt;&gt; disanulled, &gt;&gt; for anyone, I don't care who they are, &gt;&gt; to tell you that the bride will not have a ministry. And the only voice there is that God will use in this end time is the prophet is teaching you false doctrine. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Let the chips fall where they lay. I am not after any special person. It is a spirit. &gt;&gt; So when you begin to understand that two spirits, somebody say two &gt;&gt; two &gt;&gt; within the framework of the church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And by God's spirit discern &gt;&gt; and withstand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; You remember here I here I stand &gt;&gt; came out. I started to tell you the other day when brother Joseph Brham came with catch the vision tour and was here in Phoenix and I told you I talked to Joseph personally about here I stand and I I went I went to the meeting that day. It was a it was a minister's meeting and um it was a lunchon and so brother Joseph Dalton, Joe Dalton, one of my best friends and his brother Jim Jim Ed Dalton said, "Brother Ron, come go with us." Ah, I'm not. No, come go with us. So I did. So, we went to the meetings and Joe says, uh, Joe tells me, Joe Dalton, he said, "Where do you want to sit?" I I don't care. I'm going to go use the restroom. Just go get a a get a seat that I can sit next to you. So, they went in and sat down and the table was I don't know, I off the my memory maybe 60, 80 feet long. And there were all kinds of ministers and different ones and they all got that lapel pin with the wave sheath. You ever seen it? Huh? They all had that and you know and uh so we walked in and uh there was brother Joe and brother Billy and there was a whole crowd, a whole entourage of people and uh we went and just sat down at the table. We're at the end of the table and um brother Joseph and brother Billy, they signaled to me to come with all those people. I said, "No, no, it's okay. So many people, hey, I I'll catch you later." So wound up that we sat at the end of the table. Well, guess what? Guess who sat at the end of the table? Brother Joseph, Brother Billy Paul, Brother George Smith, and we all sat at the table. And guess what? Brother Joseph Brandom and Brother Billy Paul Brandom and myself are going over all of the trips that we made. And the people I introduced them to, oh, Brother Ron, do you remember? And with this and that, and here's all these ministers at the other end of the table. They all quit talking. They wanted to eaves drop on our conversation. Who is this guy? He don't even have a lapel pin on. He's not even dressed up. Can't be a believer. So, I brought with me a whole manila envelope about the copyright. Do you know that brother Brennan tried to stop everyone from giving out this message in tape or book form because he said, "I'm the only one that has the right." How many of you know that? Yeah. Yeah. He stopped. He wrote every letter or a letter to every minister that was printing this message. And he says, "If you print this message outside of Jeffersonville, it's stolen bread." How many of you know that? He said it's mine. Nobody knows this. Don't Didn't you read what he said? He said, "If you are printing this message without our permission and our copyright, you have no right and it's stolen bread." &gt;&gt; So he wrote to brother Biscll, David Momus, he wrote to all of these ministers and said, "Cease and desist." &gt;&gt; Was brother Billy Pardon? &gt;&gt; It was brother Billy Paul that said that. &gt;&gt; No, brother Joseph. &gt;&gt; Okay. You said you said brother. &gt;&gt; Did I say Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; It was technically &gt;&gt; it was brother Joseph. I'm sorry. Thank you, Stephen. &gt;&gt; You got my back. Don't you stand up here in case I say something else. You can I'm sorry. I kind of get lost in my thoughts. Do you know that when I went to work for Okay, let me finish this because I don't want to rabbit trail. I told you I spoke to brother Joseph about the here I stand but I had a manila envelope and I thought this is not the time nor the place because there is a time in a place and here's with all these ministers. I am not going to sit here and conf I'll catch you later. So I went to go use the restroom. The meetings are over. And I thought, "Ah, I'll I'll get a chance to talk to him later." So, as I went to the restroom, I was coming out. Guess who's going in? Brother Joseph Brandham. I said, "Come here, Brother Joseph." And there next to the entrance to the men's restroom were two big artificial trees. And I said, "Hey, come here." I pulled him to the side and I I said, "Come over here where if people go in and out, they won't see us." I said, "Brother Joseph, you know, I'm just your friend. I'm a nobody." I said, "But this, here I stand. I wished I could have talked to you before you wrote it. I I I believe I could have maybe helped give you a balance." Now I lie not and I tell you before God. These are exactly what he told me. Brother Ron, I wish you would have. He says, "Because when I make a mistake, I make it in front of everyone." I said, "Brother Joseph," I said, "You have no right to copyright God's voice." I said, 'If this what you say is the copyright. I said, 'Then change the name. It's not the voice of God. It's the voice of William Brano. And you have a right to every royalty and everything. And you know what? It's your daddy's message. But I said, your daddy said, I have nothing to do with this message except a voice. Against my own better judgment, I want to be a trapper. That's right. &gt;&gt; I lost the feeling for the people. Oh, I did the first and second pull. I did all these signs and all of this stuff and guess what? They just rejected it. I'm done. What good is it done for all of that? He lost the feeling. If ministers are not careful, you lose the feeling because people are not catching what they should. &gt;&gt; But hang on, hang on. It ain't over till it's over &gt;&gt; because there is a due season. That's what I want all of you to know. When it looks the worst, when it looks as though the message is nothing but a mess age and all kinds of confusion, hang on. Hang on. God ain't done yet. It's not only hearing the voice of the seventh angel messenger. It's not just pressing the tape and sitting down to listen. It's not just agreeing with the messenger and his message, but it's having the ability to hear what the spirit is saying to the church. And when we blend our voices with his voice, when we say yay and amen to what he said, do you realize you become the sound of many waters? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Yes. I've been there in the Congo with over 35,000 believers in in one meeting. I've never been in such a crowd, such a there's just a sea of black faces. And they said, "Let's all just begin to pray." And as brother Dioa was there, Shikina tabernacle and he said, "Let's just all begin to pray." And there was a fervor of the pitch of voices that it sounded like a waterfall. It was a sound of many waters. I've got it on on video even on my That's what it sounds like. Sh. And the people, even the little children, the seven and eightyear-old boys were sitting there. Oh God. Oh God. They were crying. They were adding their voice to the voices of others. &gt;&gt; I've added my voice to the voice of the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; I'm saying what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm showing you &gt;&gt; not to just try to create controversy. No, &gt;&gt; because I want you to be acutely aware of the uniting time and the sign. &gt;&gt; This is our day. This is our hour. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to pass it off. &gt;&gt; And I am not the only minister that's preaching this. There are ministries around the world right now. Now, will the bride of Christ have a ministry before the coming? Yeah, sure. Uh-huh. It's going on right now. What is it? Apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers. &gt;&gt; Right. That's what's going on. He said, "Oh, don't look for these great big No, it'll it'll be so simple people will overlook it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I have joined my voice with that voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say the same thing? When you heard it, you said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; I don't care how much it hurt. &gt;&gt; I don't care how much you didn't understand it. Those on the road to Emmas were in a confused state. They weren't sure what's going on. We thought, we thought, "Are you have haven't you been here in Jerusalem? Don't you know what's been happening?" We thought this was the one. right now we don't know. We don't know. So now he he reverts to scripture &gt;&gt; all the things concerning himself. &gt;&gt; You realize that the resurrected Christ, the interpretation of the resurrection is walking with them. You realize that he interpreted where here he was. &gt;&gt; I'm the inter I am the resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll said this one time in a sermon and I I loved it. It was He said, "The prophet said, "There's only one thing you're going to take away when you leave this earth. There's only one thing you're taking with you." And he said, "What is that?" &gt;&gt; Character. &gt;&gt; Character. Say it again. &gt;&gt; Character. So the only thing you're going to take with you is character. Understand that those two on the road to Emmas were in a state of confusion. They weren't in a prayer meeting. They weren't asking God, "What is this message all about? What they they they were in a quandry." &gt;&gt; And I love what brother Biscll said. He said, "But they had character, &gt;&gt; even when they were void of revelation, &gt;&gt; but because they had character, &gt;&gt; he joined himself to them." &gt;&gt; What about you? &gt;&gt; Maybe you you've had your doubts. You've had your little questions. And this guy said that and another guy, oh, all of this stuff. And I I don't know. That's all right. God God will see you through. &gt;&gt; Even in the state of your confusion. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's promised, "I'll get every elect seed. &gt;&gt; They're mine." God is determined &gt;&gt; to see you through. &gt;&gt; He's the author and finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I I I I didn't even get near I I'm on page seven of 14 pages. So, the only way that the bride can have a ministry is for them to activate the promises of what is left for the bride to do. We see what Malachi 4 was to do. We see Revelations 10:1. We see the mighty angel. We recognize that. But what about us? &gt;&gt; What has this message &gt;&gt; got to do with you? &gt;&gt; You are the interpretation. &gt;&gt; You are the message that God says, "I'm choosing a bride." Yeah. Who me? Mhm. Amen. So let's go beyond our carnal thinking. &gt;&gt; Go beyond just this understanding of well sent a prophet a and you can activate that all the time. God sent a prophet. Hallelujah. He was a voice. Ah amen. He'll let you sit there and do that and reiterate that and claim that as a promise. But he does not want you &gt;&gt; to catch the true revelation &gt;&gt; of the two spirits within the framework of the church. And even my position. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that clear? &gt;&gt; So I want I want my inheritance. He said that last bride under her messenger. &gt;&gt; Say what he says. Say what the Bible says. love about brother Brandon when he preaches the sermon the absolute he said the word of God that's our thumb that is our absolute &gt;&gt; and the reason that we can make the message of the hour an absolute is because the word was his absolute &gt;&gt; sing of what we didn't know &gt;&gt; huh there are certain things there. They said, even the Apostle Paul said, "I don't know. This is just I Paul. This isn't the Lord." When they asked Brother Brennham, "Uh, what about a woman wearing pajamas or uh a night gown?" He said, "Did I read that right?" He says, "I don't know. I got no thus sayaith the Lord. You shall not have have footies and a pair of pants and a shirt and call that your pajamas. You know, we had them as little boys, you know, had the little foot in and we would slide down the hallway. We'd run. And they asked Brother Brandon, "Well, what about a woman? Can she wear pajamas or is it better?" He said, "I don't No, I ain't got no. He said, "I think you look better in a night gown." &gt;&gt; And maybe you wear your pajamas and you got your little footies. That's okay. I'm not I'm going to tell you what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love him today. &gt;&gt; I know you do. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's why you're here. &gt;&gt; You all are rugged people. You've been through so much. You've seen so many ones come in here and there and some rise up and take a group off this way and over here and we're the bride and all the jumping and shouting and everything and then this movement finally peters out and then this movement over here until ah and here you are. But look at you. You're still here. &gt;&gt; Guess what? Through it all, you're still here. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm here. I ain't going nowhere. &gt;&gt; God, you're stuck with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together this morning. God bless you.

Some say God's dead and he's passed away. neighbor to my Christian friends I say keep revival no matter what it costs keep revival even if there's loss our God is still the same today and he will never pass away so keep revival we can't let this world break us down and get our minds turned around. Working through the daily grind. We ask God to keep our steps in line. His word is the truth today and we feel him when we pray. So keep revival no matter what it cost. Keep revival. Oh, even if there's loss, our God is still the same today. And he will never pass away. So keep revival. Well, the Holy Ghost is for a chosen few. It doesn't matter what the world may deem. Jesus paid in full our part. And his fire can warm our hearts. God can touch you in the pew. And alone with him, he fails me and you. So keep revival. Oh, even if there's loss, keep revival. Oh, even if there's loss, our God is still the same today. And he will never pass away. So keep revival. How many is that your heart's desire this morning? Oh, just keep revival. Oh, even if there's loss, keep revival. Oh, even if there's loss, for our God is still the same today. He will never pass away. So keep revival. That third verse, well, the Holy Ghost is for a chosen few. It doesn't matter what the world may do. Jesus paid in full our part and his fire can touch our hearts. God can touch you in the pew. Alone with him he fills me and you. So keep revival. Oh, even if there's loss, keep revival. Oh, even though there's a cost, our God is still the same today. He will never pass away. So keep revival.

So keep revival. Oh church, keep revival. Let's all stand this morning. Brother Will is going to close our service in prayer this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Amen. How many feel fed in your spirit today? Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's all just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you, Lord, for the spirit of God in this church. Lord, we thank you, Father. Lord, your prophet promised, Lord, that there would be a bride, Lord, and it wouldn't just be a bride as a group, but it would be an individual church of God, Lord. Lord, you said through your prophet that every one of us has a purpose, Father. And Lord, from our heart's desire, Father, &gt;&gt; I pray that we would all find our purpose, Lord, in the bride of Christ. Lord, as a new year comes, Lord, I pray, Father, that we would purpose. Lord, as brother Brennham said at the end of the year, he said, "I want to consecrate my life a new." Father, I pray that each one of us, Lord, Lord, that we would find a level of consecration before you, Father. Lord, I pray that this year, Father, we would find a level, Lord, that we want to ascend into the heights of the supernatural. Father, I pray Lord Jesus that your church, Father, would keep in revival in this day. Father, I pray that each one of us, Lord, from the deacon at the back, Father, to the song leader to the pastor, Father, Lord, I pray that your church would find their position, Lord Jesus. Lord, there's young people that are looking, Lord, and they don't understand which group, Lord, and they don't know why this man's fighting this man, and they don't understand why that these things are happening, Lord, in our midst as the message believers. But father, I pray that you would shine your light in our midst. Father, Lord, I pray that you would break the bondage of the enemy that would bring confusion. Father, I pray that your Holy Spirit would come upon your church, Father, in a mighty way, Lord. Lord, as you promised through the prophet Joel, I will restore, sayeth the Lord, all the Palmerworm and the cankerworm and the locust had taken from your church. But, Father, you promised that you would restore your church, your bride in the state. Father, bless your people as we go. May we go with zeal and passion, Lord Jesus. Thank you for our pastor, Brother Ron. Lord, pouring out his heart, Lord Jesus. Lord, he's seen seen so many years of confusion in groups come and go, Father. I pray, Lord, as the message was preached, Lord, let us say what the tape say, Father. Lord, and let us not just say it, but let us do it, Father. Let us not just play a mechanical device, Father, but let us do what the voice of Revelation 10:7 says to do in this day. &gt;&gt; Bless your people now, Lord. We know that the rapture is minutes away, hours away. Father, let us all be ready. Father, we just commit our lives, our hearts, &gt;&gt; our very existence to you. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you today. Thank you for coming to the house of the Lord today. May God bless your week, the rest of this week. Remember the service Wednesday night, Lord willing, brother Steve Clar will be speaking for us. God bless you. Have a blessed day today. God bless you.
