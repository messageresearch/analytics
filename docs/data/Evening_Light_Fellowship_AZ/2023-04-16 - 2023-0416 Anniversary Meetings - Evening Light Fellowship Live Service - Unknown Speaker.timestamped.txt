[58:10] a minute I just want to say something
[58:12] here just in a way of introduction
[58:17] you know things are
[58:19] God does things in unexpected ways and
[58:22] you know just with uh
[58:24] being with brother Andreas in this last
[58:28] month or I guess it was a little over a
[58:31] month now it seems like just yesterday I
[58:34] was in Germany but it was just this last
[58:36] month I was with him and we spoke for
[58:39] him in in his church and we had a
[58:41] wonderful time
[58:42] just a wonderful time and some really
[58:44] Supernatural things that were going on
[58:47] in the church I didn't know about
[58:49] and he can testify that but I was just
[58:52] so enjoying the messages the last two
[58:55] nights and and I was telling my wife
[58:57] last night I was saying you know I
[58:59] believe God has something really special
[59:02] for us tomorrow so
[59:07] so she knows she knows I'm special needs
[59:11] but she didn't think it would be me
[59:15] amen but here we are amen I want to
[59:17] appreciate brother Ron and and sister
[59:19] Sandy and the church and the
[59:21] deconstructees and treasures all the all
[59:24] the helpers and everyone that
[59:27] contributes here God bless you amen you
[59:30] make this meeting it's you that make
[59:33] this meeting amen Without You there'll
[59:36] be no one to preach to
[59:38] amen so you are the important one that's
[59:40] why God said I send you Elijah the
[59:43] prophet you are the more important one
[59:46] amen so I want to appreciate that and
[59:48] brother Ron I met him so many years ago
[59:51] the first time I met him
[59:52] uh I think I don't know brother on it
[59:55] was in the early 80s I don't know when
[59:57] you were uh we were having a convention
[59:59] in Edmonton and uh we were expecting
[1:00:02] brother Donnie Reagan
[1:00:05] and yes were you in Edmonton or you was
[1:00:11] there yeah you were there
[1:00:13] wow
[1:00:15] wow so he was there and uh brother
[1:00:18] Reagan couldn't come he was delayed did
[1:00:20] he come
[1:00:22] I don't think he didn't came yeah so you
[1:00:25] know God had a pinch hitter
[1:00:27] amen God had a pinch hitter and he
[1:00:30] knocked it out of the park
[1:00:32] it wasn't a pinch hitter we thought who
[1:00:35] is this guy who is this Ron Peterson
[1:00:37] never heard of his name before we're
[1:00:39] expecting brother Donnie Reagan and Noah
[1:00:42] yes no who's this guy so instead of
[1:00:46] pinch hitting or you know just he just
[1:00:48] hit it right out of the park and I
[1:00:50] remember what he was preaching on and
[1:00:52] and Lucifer and Satan's right-hand man
[1:00:56] and different things that were going on
[1:00:58] in the church that just settled the
[1:01:01] whole thing
[1:01:03] it for me it just settled my heart
[1:01:06] and I thought that was the connection
[1:01:08] brother that was it that was just
[1:01:11] you know you just you know I've never
[1:01:13] lifted him up on a pedestal because
[1:01:15] that's dangerous
[1:01:17] that's dangerous for the man amen we
[1:01:19] don't want to do that but something just
[1:01:22] clicked that's that's what we need God
[1:01:25] knows what we need God sets in the
[1:01:28] church
[1:01:29] Apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:01:32] evangelists so anyway that's that was my
[1:01:35] first experience there with hearing
[1:01:37] brother Ron and you know we want to
[1:01:39] thank God for this morning just the
[1:01:41] opportunity to share the word but we
[1:01:43] were at uh we're in Tucson and we we

[1:01:59] war and I got to talk to him and listen
[1:02:01] to his stories and you know it was just
[1:02:03] wonderful and I just thanked him for his
[1:02:05] service you know and he said that his
[1:02:08] first mission he was going to fly out
[1:02:11] somewhere over Germany I don't know if
[1:02:14] it was Berlin where it was they were

[1:02:25] hospital you're you know you got yellow

[1:02:56] said you better sit down and and take a
[1:02:59] drink
[1:02:59] he said because he said they all were
[1:03:02] shot down
[1:03:03] on that first mission

[1:03:07] sometimes it's a good thing to be in the

[1:04:46] we want to thank you for your the
[1:04:48] opportunity to read your word this
[1:04:50] morning Father we know that in
[1:04:52] Revelations chapter 5 when you came as a
[1:04:56] lamb and opened a book no man was Worthy
[1:04:59] to take the book or even look on the
[1:05:02] book but this morning Lord we're taking
[1:05:04] the book
[1:05:05] we're eating the book we're looking on
[1:05:08] it we're reading it we're understanding
[1:05:10] it Lord what a blessing it is just to
[1:05:14] read the word and understand where we're
[1:05:16] at today Father we thank you for the
[1:05:18] messages brother Andreas has labored and
[1:05:21] he roared like a lion here father oh God
[1:05:25] return his strength I pray father God
[1:05:28] just Lord we know all things work
[1:05:30] together for good father and we just
[1:05:32] commit him to you and ourselves now take
[1:05:34] the word the speaker and the hear will
[1:05:37] give you the glory in Jesus Christ's
[1:05:39] name amen amen chapter 2 of Hebrews
[1:05:44] um Paul speaking about the Angels here
[1:05:46] prior to this and uh but here he goes
[1:05:49] into chapter two he says therefore we
[1:05:51] ought to give the more Earnest heed to
[1:05:54] the things which we have heard
[1:05:56] less at any time we should let them slip
[1:05:59] I think we need to be earnest
[1:06:01] about what we've heard this weekend
[1:06:04] we did we need to be more earnest
[1:06:06] the prophet said he needed to be more
[1:06:09] sincere
[1:06:10] amen so for if the word spoken by Angels
[1:06:13] was steadfast
[1:06:15] and the prophet said there those angels
[1:06:17] are prophets
[1:06:18] not spiritual Angels flying around he
[1:06:21] said those are Prophet Messengers
[1:06:24] if the word spoken by Angels was
[1:06:26] steadfast in every transgression
[1:06:27] Disobedience received a just recompense
[1:06:30] of reward how shall we escape if we
[1:06:33] neglect so great a Salvation
[1:06:37] which at first began to be spoken of by
[1:06:39] the Lord and was confirmed by us unto us
[1:06:42] by them that heard him amen how shall we
[1:06:45] escape the prophet said God help that
[1:06:48] man that walks away from the message
[1:06:52] how shall we escape
[1:06:54] amen Isaiah chapter 6
[1:06:57] amen we're talking about brother Andreas
[1:07:00] was talking about the number six
[1:07:04] and it just happened it falls on this
[1:07:06] this text this morning
[1:07:09] um
[1:07:09] here Isaiah you know I I'm I'm 63
[1:07:13] brother Ron and I believe this is this
[1:07:16] is my going to be my greatest year
[1:07:19] six is the number of man and three is
[1:07:22] the number of perfection
[1:07:23] he's going to perfect that what he
[1:07:25] started in me and each one of us
[1:07:28] amen so in in chapter 6 verse 1 in the
[1:07:32] year King Uzziah died I also saw the
[1:07:34] Lord sitting on a throne high and lifted
[1:07:36] up and his train filled the temple
[1:07:39] now the the prophet said his train was
[1:07:43] the angels
[1:07:44] I always thought it was just a like a
[1:07:47] bride
[1:07:48] and A Train That's what I had in my mind
[1:07:50] but the prophet sees the vision and he
[1:07:54] said it's his angels
[1:07:55] his angels following him
[1:07:57] so he said they fill the temple and it
[1:08:00] stood and above it stood the seraphims
[1:08:03] each one had six wings Twain he covered
[1:08:05] his face twenty he covered his feet and
[1:08:07] with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto
[1:08:10] another it said holy
[1:08:13] holy
[1:08:15] holy
[1:08:16] we forget that
[1:08:18] you know sometimes we forget you know I
[1:08:21] was watching you sisters yesterday walk
[1:08:23] in with your children and your dress and
[1:08:26] the way you present yourself and I just
[1:08:28] thought that's pleasing
[1:08:30] that's what the Lord wants people today
[1:08:33] they say well that doesn't matter it
[1:08:35] matters to God
[1:08:37] the way you dress the way you behave the
[1:08:39] way you present yourself God bless you
[1:08:41] sisters God bless you mothers and
[1:08:44] raising families in this message God
[1:08:48] bless you there's a blessing on you
[1:08:50] amen so the Lord so one cry to another
[1:08:53] said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts
[1:08:56] the whole earth is full of his glory and
[1:08:58] the pulse of the door moved that the
[1:09:00] voice of him that cried and the house
[1:09:02] was filled with smoke
[1:09:04] something like the temple
[1:09:06] last night we heard about the temple
[1:09:09] fill with the glory of God
[1:09:11] then it said I woe is me for I am undone
[1:09:15] because I am a man of unclean lips and I
[1:09:18] dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:09:20] unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the
[1:09:22] king the Lord of hosts then flew one of
[1:09:25] the seraphims unto me having a live coal
[1:09:28] in his hand which he had taken from the
[1:09:30] tongues from off the Altar and he said
[1:09:31] and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo
[1:09:34] this has touched thy lips and iniquity
[1:09:37] is taken away and thy sin is purged
[1:09:41] amen that's what I want to be this
[1:09:43] morning amen God take a call of the word
[1:09:46] laid on my lips amen that I'd speak you
[1:09:49] what you want me to speak amen also I
[1:09:53] heard the voice of the Lord saying now
[1:09:55] who shall I sin and who will go for for
[1:09:57] us then said I hear am I send me amen is
[1:10:01] that your prayer this morning

[1:13:01] with this message
[1:13:03] so you know you go to Africa it's the
[1:13:05] grace of God hair Hardware
[1:13:07] you know they name their business after
[1:13:09] grace of God Hardware
[1:13:11] well it's that's good
[1:13:13] they want to be associated
[1:13:15] amen with God so nothing wrong with that
[1:13:17] so the you know as a home inspector when
[1:13:20] you see a foundation that people ask you
[1:13:22] well look at this big crack in my
[1:13:25] Foundation or you know what what
[1:13:26] happened there is it is it the quality
[1:13:28] of the cement or the the concrete or
[1:13:30] what what happened there you know well I
[1:13:32] said their settlement
[1:13:33] and you know what's the problem is it's
[1:13:35] the base preparation
[1:13:38] it's not the it's not the concrete
[1:13:41] it's not as much cement in it or rebar
[1:13:43] but it's the base
[1:13:45] preparation that has to be right
[1:13:49] the soil conditions
[1:13:51] if the soil is wrong it's it's going to
[1:13:54] show up cracks cracks are going to show
[1:13:57] up and the building's going to sink
[1:13:59] now think of that spiritually this
[1:14:01] morning
[1:14:02] some people started out but you know
[1:14:04] what they're found they're Foundation
[1:14:08] cracks all over the floods but they're
[1:14:11] seeing their own cracks
[1:14:13] it's not it's not God's church it's not
[1:14:15] God's Building it's their their
[1:14:18] Foundation was wrong
[1:14:23] the soil is right then it'll bring forth
[1:14:27] and as brother Andreas was saying we
[1:14:29] just got a war now
[1:14:31] amen so you know it's a time in the
[1:14:34] message you know there's there's
[1:14:35] environmental change there's a climate
[1:14:37] change in the world there's these things
[1:14:39] we you know we try to deny
[1:14:43] we got to be in that word all the way
[1:14:45] now Saints like brother Andreas now is
[1:14:49] we we can't play Church
[1:14:51] amen
[1:14:54] and we want to fulfill that purpose
[1:14:55] because God has a purpose and we want
[1:14:59] our purpose to be his purpose amen so
[1:15:02] these seraphims you know that
[1:15:06] talk about the the administration of a
[1:15:09] prophet
[1:15:10] uh if the if the administration or if
[1:15:12] the word spoken by Angels was steadfast
[1:15:17] and sure a sure word of Prophecy we've
[1:15:20] had in this age
[1:15:22] amen it's more sure it's actually
[1:15:25] infallible
[1:15:27] the message
[1:15:29] is infallible
[1:15:31] like brother Andrea said now you're
[1:15:33] talking about Humanity
[1:15:35] that's not that's fallible
[1:15:42] amen the mankind is the god kind that's
[1:15:46] infallible see the the office was
[1:15:49] infallible and the problem Lord Jesus
[1:15:52] Christ
[1:15:54] the prophet said he's done he's done
[1:15:56] more in my Ministry than he did in his
[1:15:59] own
[1:16:00] so who would have the power of
[1:16:01] infallibility whoa
[1:16:04] we're following a infallible message
[1:16:09] that well this mistake and that mistake
[1:16:12] yes any man could make a mistake any man
[1:16:15] can have a flaw but we're not looking at
[1:16:17] the man you know one man said one time
[1:16:19] God never protected this amen I find I
[1:16:22] see no fault
[1:16:24] Amen in him and that's who I was looking
[1:16:27] it was never about brother Brown
[1:16:33] the brand I'm only only pointed me to
[1:16:35] Jesus Christ
[1:16:37] and revealed more of himself amen so it
[1:16:40] sounds like a missionary text but it's
[1:16:42] not it's much more than that you know
[1:16:45] because here Isaiah
[1:16:48] Isaiah here he he's he's coming to the
[1:16:52] into the presence of the Lord he's
[1:16:55] coming under the influence now of angels
[1:16:59] oh God went to God that we come under
[1:17:01] the influence of angels this morning
[1:17:03] amen and and get in and stay and and get
[1:17:07] in that presence
[1:17:08] like he was that's an awesome place
[1:17:11] amen and I remember brother bicycle
[1:17:13] telling his story when the age of the
[1:17:14] Lord came in with him and brother we're
[1:17:17] not built for that but we do have angels
[1:17:20] amen we do have positions
[1:17:22] and uh you know Isaiah here he's or yeah
[1:17:27] he's leaning the prophet said in the
[1:17:29] message influence he's leaning on the
[1:17:31] arm of Flesh he's leading on the king
[1:17:35] the king had done great things for God
[1:17:39] and the kingdom of God and and he got
[1:17:42] lifted up and you know people start
[1:17:44] lifting that up and and maybe Isaiah
[1:17:46] himself lifted him up that's the danger
[1:17:49] in this day
[1:17:51] that's a danger in the message amen
[1:17:53] lifting men up oh God the prophet never
[1:17:57] lifted himself up
[1:17:59] amen he said oh and see how small you
[1:18:01] can be
[1:18:03] that was a success because he could make
[1:18:06] himself small enough that God could use
[1:18:08] him
[1:18:09] oh my so you know Isaiah you know he saw
[1:18:13] he thought Uzziah could take the place
[1:18:14] of God a minister you know he's not your
[1:18:17] Holy Ghost
[1:18:19] amen
[1:18:21] your pastor is not your Holy Ghost
[1:18:24] that's good lots of evidence
[1:18:29] amen he and just give him wisdom but you
[1:18:31] know he's not your Holy Ghost I say I I
[1:18:34] I was under brother hillebrandt for
[1:18:36] about 35 years but uh you know I always
[1:18:38] said that he never ever gave me a
[1:18:40] revelation
[1:18:42] not once
[1:18:44] he preached the word
[1:18:46] and the Holy Spirit
[1:18:48] gave me a revelation
[1:18:50] he had a gift to put it together but
[1:18:52] it's the holy ghost that gives us
[1:18:54] revelation
[1:18:56] amen and some people you know they take
[1:18:58] on the spirit of the pastor instead of
[1:19:00] the spirit of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:02] God help us it's too late now to be
[1:19:06] following man
[1:19:07] amen you need your own Holy Ghost
[1:19:10] Amen to receive that word so you know no
[1:19:14] one your parents no one can take the
[1:19:16] place of the Holy Ghost and uh
[1:19:19] you know I'm not much for I'm not much
[1:19:21] for church spirits
[1:19:24] amen I'm not much for uh National
[1:19:27] spirits
[1:19:29] you know people try to bring their
[1:19:31] nationality or their culture into the
[1:19:33] message we've got one culture and that's
[1:19:35] the word that that dominates over all
[1:19:38] the other cultures like I said I'm not a
[1:19:41] Canadian I'm not an American I'm not an
[1:19:43] African I'm a Christian we are
[1:19:45] Christians we're all one body amen but
[1:19:49] you know you'll sometimes see that
[1:19:55] German spirits you know you'll see uh
[1:19:59] I'll mention other names besides German
[1:20:01] so we don't Point them out too much
[1:20:03] African
