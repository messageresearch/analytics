[53:20] anything that that hinders your body
[53:23] usually three to four days after the
[53:26] fact is when you feel the worst huh
[53:29] usually the day after I don't feel so
[53:31] bad I kind of hit my hip and you know I
[53:33] can't hardly walk but two three days
[53:35] later whoa why on my body I tell you and

[53:48] gate we will go through the doctors
[53:51] calling Miracle Man and that's what we
[53:53] believe he is it will be Miracle upon
[53:57] miracle and there's been little issues
[53:59] that come up so do not I don't want to
[54:01] say that he's out of the woods yet I
[54:03] don't want to I want you to press the
[54:06] battle and hold him up and and we'll
[54:10] just continue to pray that the Lord will
[54:13] um continue to heal his body
[54:17] amen yeah I was there and in the room
[54:21] and the family was there with me last
[54:23] night and he was kind of in and out on
[54:26] the responses and uh yeah they had taken
[54:30] a CAT scan and and everything because
[54:32] they thought maybe it's a stroke or
[54:34] whatever but uh long story short I said
[54:37] brother Neil brother Neil
[54:40] uh do you know who this is

[54:45] I go yep that's it and I said do you

[54:56] door
[54:58] so you know he uh he knows
[55:03] um his responsibility and we love him
[55:06] and he's been a great servant to this
[55:09] body and so we discontinued to hold him
[55:13] up in prayer now I've had a little
[55:15] thought and I did not get a chance to
[55:17] totally uh go into this so I'm kind of
[55:20] just uh taking it easy this morning if
[55:24] it's a short sermon all of you can say
[55:25] amen and you go eat your lunch a little
[55:28] early and you'll be thankful for that
[55:30] yeah so anyway Deuteronomy chapter 7
[55:33] Deuteronomy 7
[55:35] and then Numbers Chapter 22.
[55:44] just uh while you're turning
[55:47] I remember a time that brother heino
[55:50] bowdenkamp and I were sent to go and
[55:54] take the largest meetings they had had
[55:56] in the East block country ever assembled
[55:59] and this was just about two weeks after
[56:02] Chernobyl blew up and we are only yes
[56:08] 60 miles or so away from where Chernobyl
[56:12] was and as you all remember it sounded
[56:15] like there was a green Cloud over the
[56:17] area and radioactivity and everybody's
[56:19] glowing green and uh you know just
[56:22] contamination and that sort of thing and
[56:24] and
[56:25] um Brother Joseph Branham brother Billy
[56:28] Paul Brother Floyd Patterson had sent us
[56:30] in a couple years before to go and set
[56:33] up the meeting so we gone and set up the
[56:35] meetings Chernobyl blows up they call me
[56:38] brother Ron we can't come I said well
[56:41] you back then we didn't have cell phones
[56:43] you didn't have the faxes you there was
[56:45] only one landline in the whole city
[56:48] where they were having the meetings and
[56:49] it worked intermittently and so they
[56:53] said you're going to have to go in for
[56:55] us and let them know uh and I
[56:57] immediately said okay hey brother heino
[56:59] and I didn't even think about it hey you
[57:01] guys don't want to go but you'll send me
[57:06] you know but listen God will send you
[57:08] right in the middle of a war God will
[57:10] send you right in the middle of a green
[57:11] cloud and I don't care if you're in the
[57:13] will of God God will keep you
[57:15] amen and so we went there in the long
[57:18] story short we preached and his first
[57:21] convention I'd ever preached and this
[57:23] place was back
[57:26] and after about four days I had nothing
[57:28] nothing I mean out of gas can't find an
[57:32] anointed word in the scripture I told my
[57:36] my translator listen heino's gonna have
[57:38] to take the last service I'm out of gas
[57:40] do you understand yes yes and as it was
[57:43] brother Peter snagon the pastor there he
[57:46] said uh we're going to have brother
[57:47] heino get up this morning and so Hino
[57:50] got up and he he spoke just 20 minutes
[57:53] and and then he he sat down and I
[57:55] thought wow praise God we're going to
[57:58] get in the car and we're going to leave
[57:59] early and we got a 12-hour drive and I'm
[58:02] thinking all these things well the
[58:04] service didn't stop right there brother
[58:06] schnegon got up and he said thank you
[58:09] for the appetizer now we're ready for
[58:11] the main entree and bro and I you know I
[58:14] don't speak Polish but I hear that
[58:16] Ron Peterson that really and I'm
[58:19] thinking no
[58:21] no surely
[58:23] and so that my translator said brother
[58:26] Ron they're asking you to now I said
[58:28] didn't you tell
[58:30] yeah yeah but
[58:32] okay here's what happened I never do
[58:35] this before nor since but I did Russian
[58:38] roulette with my Bible
[58:40] Lord wherever it falls open I put my
[58:45] finger to it I'll preach from there
[58:47] never had I ever preached from the book
[58:49] of Deuteronomy
[58:51] it fell in Deuteronomy chapter 7 6.
[58:56] through nine let's read
[59:00] for thou art and holy people unto the
[59:03] Lord thy God
[59:05] the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be
[59:08] a special people unto himself
[59:12] above all the people that are upon the
[59:15] face of the Earth
[59:18] the Lord did not set his love upon you
[59:20] nor choose you because you were more in
[59:23] number
[59:24] than any people for you were the fewest
[59:28] of all people but because the Lord loved
[59:31] you
[59:33] but because the Lord loved you
[59:37] and because he would keep the oath which
[59:40] he had sworn unto your fathers
[59:42] hath the Lord brought you out with a
[59:44] mighty hand redeemed you out of the
[59:47] house of bondman and from the hand of
[59:50] pharaoh king of Egypt
[59:53] know therefore that the Lord thy God he
[59:56] is God the faithful God which keepeth
[1:00:00] Covenant and mercy with them that love
[1:00:02] him and keep his Commandments to a
[1:00:05] thousand
[1:00:07] Generations oh that ought to put a smile
[1:00:10] on your face this morning give him
[1:00:12] praise this morning would you please
[1:00:15] come on now give him praise
[1:00:17] yeah amen amen God bless you you may be
[1:00:21] seated
[1:00:22] I'll continue reading but because it's a
[1:00:25] lengthy one I'm going to let you be
[1:00:27] seated
[1:00:28] turn with me to Numbers Chapter 22.
[1:00:32] numbers 22.
[1:00:38] verses 1 through 12.
[1:00:43] and the children of Israel
[1:00:46] set forward and pitched in the plains of
[1:00:49] Moab
[1:00:50] on this side Jordan by Jericho and balak
[1:00:54] the son of zippor saw all that Israel
[1:00:57] had done to the amorites
[1:01:00] and Moab was sore afraid of the people
[1:01:03] because they were many and Moab was
[1:01:06] distressed because of the children of
[1:01:08] Israel now you all know the moabites
[1:01:11] are from uh the daughters of lot through
[1:01:14] an incestuous
[1:01:16] Union
[1:01:18] okay
[1:01:19] so they're distant relatives of Israel
[1:01:24] and Moab said unto the Elders of Midian
[1:01:26] now shall this company look up all that
[1:01:29] are round about us
[1:01:30] and as the ox licketh up the grass of
[1:01:34] the field and balak the son of zippor
[1:01:36] was King of the mobites at that time
[1:01:40] and he sent Messengers therefore unto
[1:01:42] Balaam the son of bior to pathor
[1:01:45] which is by the river of the land of the
[1:01:47] children of his people to call him
[1:01:50] saying behold there as the people come
[1:01:52] out from Egypt behold they cover the
[1:01:55] face of the Earth this guy's full of
[1:01:57] exaggerations
[1:01:59] and they abide over against me
[1:02:03] come now therefore I pray thee curse me
[1:02:06] this people
[1:02:07] for they are too Mighty for me per
[1:02:10] Adventure I shall Prevail that we may
[1:02:13] Smite them and that I may drive them out
[1:02:16] of the land for I what that he whom thou
[1:02:21] blessest is blessed
[1:02:24] in he whom thou cursest is cursed and
[1:02:28] the Elders of Moab and the Elders of
[1:02:30] Midian departed with the rewards of
[1:02:33] divination look at that he's sending
[1:02:35] rewards of divination of sorcery
[1:02:39] in their hand and they came unto Balaam
[1:02:41] and spake on him the words of balak
[1:02:44] and he said unlim Lodge here this night
[1:02:47] and I will bring you word again as the
[1:02:49] Lord shall speak unto me and the princes
[1:02:52] of Moab Abode with Balaam and God came
[1:02:56] to Balaam and said what men are these
[1:02:59] with thee
[1:03:01] and Balaam said unto God balak the son
[1:03:04] of zippor the king of Moab hath sent
[1:03:07] unto me saying
[1:03:10] beholders of people come out of Egypt
[1:03:12] which covereth the face of the Earth
[1:03:15] come now curse me them per Adventure I
[1:03:18] shall be able to overcome them and drive
[1:03:20] them out
[1:03:21] and God said unto Balaam
[1:03:24] Thou shalt not go with them
[1:03:27] thou shall not curse the people
[1:03:35] oh
[1:03:38] for they are blessed
[1:03:42] amen don't you love God's word
[1:03:45] amen thou shall not go with him thou
[1:03:48] shall not curse the people
[1:03:50] for they are blessed I would like to
[1:03:52] title my sermon this morning and I'm
[1:03:54] hoping I can bring this thought together
[1:03:58] of looking at the backside of Israel
[1:04:02] and I want to take for a subject how can
[1:04:04] you curse what God has blessed
[1:04:12] now God
[1:04:15] has a love but his love is a elective
[1:04:18] love
[1:04:21] by God's foreknowledge he knew who would
[1:04:24] and who would not
[1:04:27] and God is omniscient and he is
[1:04:30] all-knowing therefore he could by
[1:04:33] foreknowledge no who would and who would
[1:04:35] not
[1:04:36] I want you to understand that it is
[1:04:38] God's elective love upon his people that
[1:04:44] set you apart
[1:04:46] it's not you it's not what you've done
[1:04:49] it's not what family you come through
[1:04:51] but it's God's elective love
[1:04:54] that's watched over you
[1:04:56] I wish you said a little bit of a
[1:04:58] precedent here as we go simonian Church
[1:05:01] age brother Ram said the cloudy skies
[1:05:03] and storms of life are no signs of God's
[1:05:07] disapproval
[1:05:09] get happy some people some of you you
[1:05:12] have all kinds of Cloudy Skies and
[1:05:16] storms of life but listen God does it
[1:05:18] for a purpose neither are bright skies
[1:05:22] in Stillwater signs of his love and
[1:05:24] approval
[1:05:25] his approval of any of us is only in the
[1:05:30] Beloved
[1:05:31] his love is elective which he had for us
[1:05:35] before the foundation of the world
[1:05:38] does he love us ah yes
[1:05:42] but how shall we know
[1:05:44] we shall know because he said so
[1:05:48] how many believe his word and if he told
[1:05:51] you he loves you believe it
[1:05:54] and manifested that he did love us for
[1:05:57] he brought us to himself
[1:06:00] and gave us of his spirit
[1:06:03] pleasing us as sons and she how shall I
[1:06:07] prove my love to him
[1:06:09] by believing what he said
[1:06:12] and by conducting myself with joy amidst
[1:06:15] the trials that he in his wisdom allows
[1:06:20] to come to pass
[1:06:24] amen
[1:06:27] now when we look at Israel coming out of
[1:06:30] Egypt
[1:06:32] and you can easily parallel
[1:06:36] God's love and Covenant with Israel with
[1:06:40] what he will also do with his bride
[1:06:43] brother Brenham so many times talks and
[1:06:46] parallels Israel and the church
[1:06:50] the 144
[1:06:52] 000 and the ten virgins he begins to
[1:06:55] show you the first Exodus and the last
[1:06:58] Exodus he begins to make these parallels
[1:07:01] so that you can see what God has done in
[1:07:04] the past he will also do in the future
[1:07:07] brother REM said the Old Testament is
[1:07:11] actually unfolded into the New Testament
[1:07:14] because you can see by the patterns in
[1:07:16] the examples because there's so many
[1:07:19] times in the New Testament it says as it
[1:07:22] was so shall it be it takes you back as
[1:07:25] it was in the days of Sodom so shall it
[1:07:28] be as it was in the days of Noah so
[1:07:31] shall it be so we understand that God
[1:07:33] keeps his word
[1:07:37] so
[1:07:39] what is it that makes Israel so special
[1:07:42] among all the people of the world
[1:07:45] isn't that an amazing thought
[1:07:48] God said look I've chosen you Israel
[1:07:52] not because you're the greatest
[1:07:54] not because of the works that you've
[1:07:56] done
[1:07:57] or the works that you will do but
[1:07:59] because I have chosen to love you
[1:08:02] I think that's something that all of us
[1:08:05] right now should accept the very fact
[1:08:07] that God loves you and that he gave
[1:08:11] himself for you just like he it wasn't
[1:08:14] you choosing him
[1:08:16] it was God choosing you but because he
[1:08:19] chose you he gave you a heart to want to
[1:08:21] follow him
[1:08:23] amen
[1:08:27] what made him so special they were
[1:08:29] chosen
[1:08:31] they are the ones that God chose
[1:08:35] they did not choose God but rather God
[1:08:37] chose them God's Love Therefore is an
[1:08:41] elective love
[1:08:44] it's God's choosing and not yours
[1:08:49] the theme of God's elective love is seen
[1:08:51] from Genesis to revelation
[1:08:55] a good example of that which I wish to
[1:08:58] highlight for a a bit during this
[1:09:01] service
[1:09:03] is the story of Jacob and Esau
[1:09:06] and when we look at the story of Jacob
[1:09:09] and Esau
[1:09:11] and with carnal thinking
[1:09:14] we look at that story and I think oh my
[1:09:18] I feel sorry for Esau
[1:09:21] Esau was a better man
[1:09:24] Esau in fact was loved by Isaac
[1:09:29] the Bible says and God love excuse me
[1:09:32] Isaac loved Esau but Rebecca
[1:09:36] love Jacob
[1:09:38] here are two Godly Parents
[1:09:40] that have children
[1:09:43] and here is a a man who serves his
[1:09:46] father he's going out he kills venison
[1:09:49] he comes back he brings it to his father
[1:09:52] and by all means of looking at it with a
[1:09:57] carnal mind Esau being the firstborn
[1:10:00] should have received the birthright
[1:10:03] but he really didn't have a desire there
[1:10:07] was something inside of him that maybe
[1:10:09] he took it for granted maybe he thought
[1:10:12] well because I am the firstborn
[1:10:13] therefore God owes it to me listen God
[1:10:16] don't owe you nothing God can change his
[1:10:19] hands God can give what you should have
[1:10:22] gotten to somebody else if you don't
[1:10:24] cherish you better cherish what God
[1:10:27] has chosen you for you better you better
[1:10:29] embrace the promises for you how dare
[1:10:32] you pass him off to another womb how
[1:10:35] dare you pass him off to another church
[1:10:37] how dare you pass them off to another
[1:10:39] bosom embrace it this morning and say I
[1:10:43] am the chosen of God
[1:10:50] brother Branham in a sermon in 1953 now
[1:10:53] listen to the title of this sermon
[1:10:56] the cruelty of sin
[1:10:58] and the penalty that it costs to rid Sin
[1:11:02] from our lives
[1:11:04] very good sermon if you want to go
[1:11:07] listen to that
[1:11:10] now for the sake of time I am going to
[1:11:13] just read the highlighted portions again
[1:11:16] I always tell you when I give you a
[1:11:18] quote
[1:11:19] it's not that I want to just take
[1:11:21] something out of context and I prefer
[1:11:24] that you go back and listen to the tape
[1:11:26] in its entirety but nevertheless
[1:11:30] Esau was the same Esau in his character
[1:11:34] was a better man than Jacob more of a
[1:11:37] gentleman he loved his father and the
[1:11:39] things he'd done but God chose Jacob
[1:11:44] somebody say Amen
[1:11:46] listen
[1:11:48] there are people a whole lot better than
[1:11:50] you
[1:11:51] don't sit there with a halo over your
[1:11:53] head thinking ah hey you know I am so
[1:11:56] predestinated I'm elected of God and
[1:11:59] everything and yeah you got problems
[1:12:01] I'll tell you what every one of you got
[1:12:04] a backside every one of you have got
[1:12:06] parts of of you and of your life that
[1:12:10] you want to keep covered and the only
[1:12:12] way you can keep it covered is stay
[1:12:14] under the blood because when you have a
[1:12:16] mediator when you have one that stands
[1:12:19] between you and the judgments of God
[1:12:21] because even as the New Testament says
[1:12:24] and some of you were fornicators some of
[1:12:26] you were adulterers some of you were
[1:12:29] backbiters but God rich in Mercy
[1:12:32] Hallelujah
[1:12:39] the follow along with this quote 1959
[1:12:42] questions answers
[1:12:44] Esau a far better man than every way
[1:12:46] you wanted to take it than Jacob was now
[1:12:51] Esau God forgive me for this remark
[1:12:54] he was just a little sneaker that's all
[1:12:57] now if you notice him what was he a
[1:13:00] little
[1:13:01] tattletail and a big liar
[1:13:04] now if I'm saying wrong God forgive me
[1:13:07] but he did lie
[1:13:09] and a cheat
[1:13:11] there was never one like him hardly
[1:13:14] when he took them speckled sticks even
[1:13:16] put them in the water to cause those
[1:13:18] pregnated cattle and sheep over there to
[1:13:20] bring four speckled sheep and speckled
[1:13:22] cattle to get them on his own own hands
[1:13:26] how many of you remember that in the
[1:13:28] Bible
[1:13:29] what did he do he put Esau's coat on him
[1:13:33] and a piece of sheepskin everything else
[1:13:35] and went up there and impersonated Esau
[1:13:39] here he is going forth in deception
[1:13:43] before his blind Father which was a
[1:13:46] prophet that's right why he was a little
[1:13:49] shyster he really was ah now brother REM
[1:13:54] catches him and maybe I I have Honda
[1:13:57] said it that way see I I don't mean it
[1:13:59] that way I'll take that back I I don't
[1:14:03] know you know what he was
[1:14:05] you just think in your mind he was a
[1:14:08] great man of God and I don't want to say
[1:14:09] nothing bad about him God help us to
[1:14:12] have that same type attitude
[1:14:14] but fact is fact
[1:14:16] this is prior
[1:14:19] to this conversion
[1:14:24] but I'm just trying to point out little
[1:14:26] things that he did
[1:14:28] just look how sneaking he was liar sure
[1:14:32] he was he was terrible
[1:14:36] but what was he trying to do
[1:14:40] Esau cared for his father
[1:14:43] and made him Venison and Isaac loved to
[1:14:47] to eat some pottage
[1:14:50] that he had made for him from the
[1:14:53] Venison and Jacob was a shyster and a
[1:14:56] mama's boy
[1:14:58] and I
[1:15:01] have you to better understand this
[1:15:03] elective love let's go to the Bible to
[1:15:05] research what does the Bible talk about
[1:15:08] God's love and Jacob and Esau because
[1:15:12] we're using that as an example Genesis
[1:15:15] chapter 25 after the conception now here
[1:15:19] was two Godly Parents
[1:15:21] Isaac and Rebecca
[1:15:23] two Godly Parents have come together in
[1:15:25] a holy Union this was not uh Rebecca
[1:15:30] sleeping with another man getting
[1:15:32] pregnant and then coming to to Isaac but
[1:15:35] this is Isaac and Rebecca this is
[1:15:38] conception from one husband with one uh
[1:15:42] church with one bride you understand
[1:15:44] okay so now watch this I'm going to say
[1:15:48] this so that all of you understand there
[1:15:50] is a recessive gene
[1:15:54] sometimes in the lineage of Godly
[1:16:01] so as much as you want to claim every
[1:16:05] child is a child of God through holy
[1:16:10] parents it's just a matter of time the
[1:16:13] seed will manifest
[1:16:16] who's it's a
[1:16:18] okay not to take away any of you some of
[1:16:21] you say well I'm claiming my kids and
[1:16:23] everything and yeah they go they may
[1:16:25] stray but they can't stay I'm not I'm
[1:16:27] just saying you cannot change the seed
[1:16:32] now here we go
[1:16:34] Genesis 25.
[1:16:36] verses 23 through 28.
[1:16:40] and the Lord said unto her
[1:16:42] two nations are in thy womb
[1:16:46] two manner of people
[1:16:49] shall be separated from thy Bells
[1:16:52] and one people shall be stronger than
[1:16:54] the other people
[1:16:56] and the Elder Shall Serve the younger
[1:16:59] this is prophecy going for
[1:17:02] and when her days be delivered were
[1:17:04] fulfilled behold there were twins in her
[1:17:08] womb
[1:17:09] and the first came out red all over
[1:17:11] Harry Garman
[1:17:13] they called his name Esau
[1:17:17] and after that came his brother out and
[1:17:20] his hand took hold on Esau's heel
[1:17:24] and his name was called Jacob so Jacob
[1:17:27] was already fighting for the birthright
[1:17:30] he wanted to come forth but because Esau
[1:17:34] was Stronger he fought his way out and
[1:17:37] Jacob was gone I should have been there
[1:17:41] so they're they're already tangling up
[1:17:44] they're sibling rivalry
[1:17:47] and Isaac was three Square score years
[1:17:49] old when she bear them and the boys grew
[1:17:53] and Esau was a cunning Hunter a man of
[1:17:57] the field
[1:17:59] Earthly
[1:18:02] and Jacob was a plain man
[1:18:05] dwelling in tents
[1:18:08] you see the difference
[1:18:11] and Isaac loved Esau
[1:18:15] because he did eat of his venison
[1:18:18] but Rebecca
[1:18:20] loved Jacob
[1:18:22] now here is a godly man and wife
[1:18:26] that are showing favoritism to two
[1:18:28] different children
[1:18:29] oh dad loves you better well mom loves
[1:18:32] you more
[1:18:33] you ever had that in a family
[1:18:36] and boy let me tell you those kids will
[1:18:39] know how to play that on their parents
[1:18:41] or on their siblings
[1:18:45] understand something here Jacob could
[1:18:48] not help what he was because of his
[1:18:51] natural birth
[1:18:54] neither could you
[1:18:56] you can't change who you are and your
[1:19:00] nature until God gives you a nature
[1:19:03] change by a new birth
[1:19:06] Jacob his name meant supplanter Deceiver
[1:19:10] and according to Genesis 27 he stole the
[1:19:14] birthright
[1:19:15] because it was before his conversion at
[1:19:18] Pino remember he didn't get converted in
[1:19:21] Bethel he only had experiences in Bethel
[1:19:24] people have experiences in Bethel
[1:19:27] meaning House of God house of God
[1:19:29] experiences are lovely you can see
[1:19:31] Angels you can feel his presence you can
[1:19:34] come and know that my God this is an
[1:19:38] awesome Place God is here you can feel
[1:19:41] warm and fuzzy that don't change you
[1:19:44] you need an experience where you come
[1:19:46] and you meet God face to face and you
[1:19:50] come and you wrestle with him and I'll
[1:19:52] tell you what this message is worth
[1:19:54] wrestling god for you're not going to
[1:19:56] get blessed by this message by sitting
[1:19:58] back on a Pew and sitting there and just
[1:20:01] asking God bless me bless me you're
[1:20:03] going to fight for it if you don't want
[1:20:05] to fight for it it ain't yours
[1:20:08] step out of the way let somebody else
[1:20:10] have your right
[1:20:11] amen excuse me
[1:20:15] if it were not for election
[1:20:18] there's no way Jacob would have
[1:20:20] made it
[1:20:22] he was not saved by his Works he was
[1:20:25] saved by grace
[1:20:28] certainly Jacob would have been judged
[1:20:30] by God's Own law and found guilty of
[1:20:32] lying and stealing
[1:20:35] and to be no Liars
[1:20:38] and Steelers there in heaven
[1:20:42] Jacob according to God's Own law
[1:20:46] would not have made it
[1:20:48] so if we look at with carnal eyes
[1:20:51] at this story even how Rebecca in
[1:20:55] deception to her husband
[1:20:58] can you imagine
[1:21:01] sisters you ever done something
[1:21:04] that maybe you didn't tell all the truth
[1:21:06] to your hubby
[1:21:09] yeah don't don't raise your hand
[1:21:12] everybody will know
[1:21:15] but yeah you know I just don't
[1:21:20] so
[1:21:22] Rebecca
[1:21:25] she makes a deceptive plan
[1:21:28] because she wants
[1:21:32] Jacob to receive the birthright
[1:21:35] so there's something moving
[1:21:38] that's compelling her even if it's
[1:21:42] deceptive even if it's telling a lie Hey
[1:21:47] listen don't you ever judge a book by
[1:21:49] its cover
[1:21:52] everyone has a backside
[1:21:54] have you ever lied have you ever done
[1:21:57] something wrong you ever looked at
[1:21:59] something wrong you ever acted wrong
[1:22:07] you ever had somebody cut off cut you
[1:22:10] off in traffic
[1:22:11] and scream and use off-color words to
[1:22:15] you
[1:22:18] that shakes me up
[1:22:22] I have to let it go
[1:22:26] happen to me just the other day
[1:22:32] yeah
[1:22:35] hey I said Relax lady
[1:22:42] anyway
[1:22:44] just confessing our faults one to
[1:22:47] another it's good it's good
[1:22:49] I know all of you you don't have that I
[1:22:51] know all of you are really close to
[1:22:53] Perfection now but I know God is still
[1:22:55] working on me
[1:22:57] now
[1:22:58] watch this we must not look at things
[1:23:01] through carnal eyes because if we do
[1:23:05] we'll become critical
[1:23:07] and guess what there ain't nobody right
[1:23:09] but you
[1:23:12] ever seen somebody when they get that
[1:23:14] critical deal he's wrong he's wrong he
[1:23:17] got a wrong attitude that ain't good
[1:23:19] wrong attitude but me
[1:23:21] now it already shows you got a wrong
[1:23:23] attitude
[1:23:25] tell you what when you get close to God
[1:23:26] in the love of God you love everybody
[1:23:30] you're not trying to look for faults
[1:23:32] you look to the cross
[1:23:34] amen
[1:23:35] now hearing recognizing acting on the
[1:23:38] word 1960
[1:23:40] Whenever there is a Revival it always
[1:23:43] produces twins
[1:23:45] that's a rude remark but it's true
[1:23:47] when there was a birth out from Isaac
[1:23:50] and Rebecca It produced twins
[1:23:53] when the world was created It produced
[1:23:56] twins two trees
[1:23:58] and when Cain and Abel were were born It
[1:24:01] produced two Ishmael and Isaac born
[1:24:04] one of them natural one of them of the
[1:24:06] Earth the other one Supernatural on one
[1:24:09] looked at the natural intellectual and
[1:24:11] the one walked by the spirit it's always
[1:24:13] been that way
[1:24:16] let me see this
[1:24:18] that's the way it is even with the
[1:24:21] intellectual ones who are trying to
[1:24:23] understand the word
[1:24:25] did you know that the children of this
[1:24:28] world are smarter than the children of
[1:24:32] the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:24:33] don't try to match wits with them
[1:24:36] Satan is the greatest sulfist do you
[1:24:39] know what a sophist is
[1:24:41] an arguer somebody that just likes to
[1:24:43] argue to to argue do you know anybody
[1:24:46] like that
[1:24:50] God help you if you do
[1:24:52] because you'll never win an argument
[1:24:54] with somebody who likes to argue I mean
[1:24:57] especially if they've got to get the
[1:24:59] last word
[1:25:00] anyway
[1:25:03] did you know brother Brown said it's
[1:25:06] usually the intellectual ones that are
[1:25:09] susceptible to demon spirits
[1:25:12] thank you Lord I don't have a problem in
[1:25:14] that area
[1:25:16] some of you I'm gonna
[1:25:18] I'm you thinkers you intellectual you
[1:25:22] got to try to figure it out be careful
[1:25:24] there's a demon lurking right around you
[1:25:27] trying to get into your thoughts trying
[1:25:29] to
[1:25:30] corrupt your mind trying to take you to
[1:25:33] figure this out brother Brown said
[1:25:35] listen when you got it all figured out
[1:25:37] you know one thing and that's that
[1:25:39] you're wrong so I don't need to got to
[1:25:41] figure it out all they got to do is
[1:25:43] believe it
[1:25:44] [Applause]
[1:25:48] now every
[1:25:50] time that we get an ism within the
[1:25:53] message
[1:25:53] and ism is a tangent it's a grafted in
[1:25:57] Vine
[1:25:58] it's a grafted-in branch every time we
[1:26:01] got it it's because somebody
[1:26:03] intellectual added their own opinion
[1:26:06] their own interpretation to the word of
[1:26:08] God and God is his own interpreter
[1:26:12] and so what they do is they say well
[1:26:15] uh let me give you an example I had a
[1:26:18] brother one time who he believed in
[1:26:20] return Ministry and so we sat down one
[1:26:24] time and I said please my brother I I
[1:26:26] really don't understand
[1:26:27] this concept of return Ministry what do
[1:26:31] you believe
[1:26:32] and he's he began to elaborate and he
[1:26:35] took several hours
[1:26:37] and when he got done and I said this my
[1:26:41] brother
[1:26:42] I said Thank you for taking the time
[1:26:45] to explain to me about I'll write this
[1:26:48] Trail again uh pray day and night for
[1:26:51] God to raise his Prophet
[1:26:54] um God uh watch uh I'm an early riser
[1:26:58] you know the quote brother Ram said you
[1:26:59] know I'm an early riser see see
[1:27:03] because he said he's an early riser he's
[1:27:06] going to rise up early he's going to be
[1:27:07] the first one and so therefore that
[1:27:09] means return Ministry do you see what
[1:27:12] I'm saying and so every quote
[1:27:14] that was given you have to stretch it
[1:27:16] and stretch it to the farthest of your
[1:27:20] imagination I mean brother Brahm said
[1:27:23] you know I'm an early riser because
[1:27:24] Billy Paul is lazy he likes to sleep in
[1:27:29] and I like to get up early
[1:27:32] he's not talking about Resurrection
[1:27:36] but you know all of this and so all of
[1:27:39] these quotes and I said well do you have
[1:27:40] scripture for it
[1:27:42] there's got to be scripture and really
[1:27:45] they have no scriptural foundation for
[1:27:48] the return Ministry and so what it is
[1:27:51] it's a man's intellectual carnal logical
[1:27:55] approach if the prophet didn't finish
[1:27:58] his ministry therefore he's got to come
[1:28:01] back
[1:28:03] do you see what I'm seeing and so
[1:28:05] understand that every time that you have
[1:28:07] an ism some kind of teaching within the
[1:28:10] message it's because what men try to do
[1:28:12] is put their own interpretation of the
[1:28:17] word of God and brother Brahm said God
[1:28:19] is his own interpreter leave it alone
[1:28:23] amen
[1:28:29] we know that to type
[1:28:32] with brother Branham in his ministry
[1:28:35] because in 1933 as John the Baptist was
[1:28:40] sent to forerun the first coming you and
[1:28:43] your ministry shall forerun the second
[1:28:45] coming so we have a type and Shadow
[1:28:47] perfectly of John is that right and John
[1:28:51] one day he came and saw uh the Messiah
[1:28:55] coming he was in the water and the
[1:28:59] Messiah came to him and he saw something
[1:29:02] Supernatural and he said Behold the Lamb
[1:29:05] of God which takes away he's already by
[1:29:08] Supernatural reasoning and understanding
[1:29:11] is looking at a man who's on the banks
[1:29:15] of the river in fact John said I don't
[1:29:18] need to baptize you you need to baptize
[1:29:21] me and he said John that it might be
[1:29:24] fulfilled you have needs to baptize me
[1:29:28] Hallelujah Behold the Lamb of God there
[1:29:32] he did not need to come when the
[1:29:35] resurrection of the Old Testament Saints
[1:29:37] after John was beheaded he didn't have
[1:29:40] to come up early and return back and
[1:29:42] tell the people Behold the Lamb he's
[1:29:45] already introduced the lamb
[1:29:48] keeps your types and shadows running
[1:29:55] now we're looking at God's elective love
[1:29:58] in the example of Jacob and Esau
[1:30:01] and let the scriptures now now let's go
[1:30:03] to Romans chapter 9.
[1:30:06] Romans chapter 9 for just a moment
[1:30:13] verses 11 through 16.
[1:30:19] for the children being not yet born
[1:30:23] wait a second
[1:30:25] before the child
[1:30:28] was born
[1:30:30] let me say this that before he was even
[1:30:34] conceived
[1:30:37] there was a plan in God's mind
[1:30:41] for the children being not yet born
[1:30:44] neither having done any good or evil
[1:30:49] that the purpose of God
[1:30:52] according to election might stand not of
[1:30:55] works but of him that calleth
[1:31:00] it was said unto her the Elder Shall
[1:31:03] Serve the younger remember there are
[1:31:06] numbers 25 we just read that
[1:31:08] as it is written Jacob have I loved
[1:31:12] but Esau have I hated
[1:31:16] what shall we say then
[1:31:18] is there unrighteousness with God
[1:31:23] forbid
[1:31:24] for he saith to Moses I will have mercy
[1:31:29] on whom I will have mercy and I will
[1:31:32] have compassion on whom I will have
[1:31:34] compassion
[1:31:36] so then it is not of him that willeth
[1:31:39] nor of him that runeth
[1:31:42] but of God that shows Mercy
[1:31:46] so it's God's elective love and
[1:31:48] predestinated plan that he had chose
[1:31:52] Jacob to be the recipient of God's love
[1:31:58] brother random uses the wording he said
[1:32:01] God knew you before the foundation of
[1:32:03] the world
[1:32:04] you were conceived in his mind he put an
[1:32:07] election
[1:32:08] and predestinated an ordained plan upon
[1:32:12] your life and there he slipped the
[1:32:15] wedding band of unmerited favor upon
[1:32:18] your finger so when you came into this
[1:32:22] world not knowing who you were why
[1:32:25] because you came down bypassing your
[1:32:28] theophany it's still in God's Eternal
[1:32:31] plan bypass the theophany but you were
[1:32:34] there in the mind of God you were there
[1:32:37] in the beginning you were there when
[1:32:39] Satan rose up and Lucifer preached his
[1:32:42] sermon and so many came onto his side
[1:32:45] but there were people that said we'll
[1:32:48] not listen we'll not bow we will keep
[1:32:52] God as our absolute and the prophet of
[1:32:55] God said it's God so loved
[1:32:58] to see those he lack seed
[1:33:02] tell Lucifer
[1:33:04] that they don't believe his plan and
[1:33:07] they took sides with God and brother
[1:33:10] Branham said there God so loved it that
[1:33:13] he took away your memory
[1:33:15] you don't remember and he gave you
[1:33:18] Amnesia listen to the sermon spiritual
[1:33:21] Amnesia and he sets you down here on
[1:33:24] Earth in Satan's Eden because the other
[1:33:28] happened in God's Eden and he says so I
[1:33:31] put him down here in Satan's Eden I
[1:33:34] erased it from their memory but he says
[1:33:37] there'll be some kind of things that
[1:33:39] will happen while they're down here that
[1:33:42] all of a sudden they'll be a little
[1:33:44] flash they'll be a little something
[1:33:47] little strike that seed and when it does
[1:33:50] the remembrance for just a moment we'll
[1:33:52] come back and you'll be jettisoned back
[1:33:55] into oh oh I just had a thought though
[1:33:58] Maya was so quickened by it let me tell
[1:34:01] you that quickening is what was
[1:34:04] quickening
[1:34:05] Enoch
[1:34:06] and he was catching Revelation upon
[1:34:09] Revelation until one time it's fled
[1:34:12] stepped into a revelation and it didn't
[1:34:15] come down
[1:34:16] Hallelujah this Revelation that is
[1:34:19] striking you now is gonna strike a place
[1:34:22] one time till this bride is going to be
[1:34:26] moved into section heavily atmosphere
[1:34:29] she will not come back to this earth
[1:34:34] you'll step right into the vision of the
[1:34:37] Rapture brother Brown said that's what
[1:34:39] the bride is waiting for for the
[1:34:41] revelation
[1:34:44] foreign
[1:34:52] you got nothing to do with this
[1:35:00] purging me in church age
[1:35:04] so Israel
[1:35:06] came up to the borders of Moab sent
[1:35:08] Messengers to the king
[1:35:11] saying we are brothers
[1:35:13] let us pass through your land
[1:35:16] if our people or animals eat or drink
[1:35:19] anything we'll gladly pay for it
[1:35:21] but King Bala got very excited the head
[1:35:24] of that Nickelodeon bunch
[1:35:26] was not about to let the church come
[1:35:30] through
[1:35:31] with its signs and wonders and divers
[1:35:33] manifestations of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:37] with their faces shining with the glory
[1:35:39] of God
[1:35:40] it's too risky
[1:35:42] he might lose some of his crowd
[1:35:45] so balak refused to let Israel pass
[1:35:48] through
[1:35:50] in fact so great was his fear of them
[1:35:52] that he went to an hireling Prophet
[1:35:55] called Balaam and asked him to mediate
[1:35:58] between him and God in petition the
[1:36:01] almighty to curse Israel and render them
[1:36:04] in potent
[1:36:05] and Balaam being eager to take part in
[1:36:08] political affairs
[1:36:10] God help us
[1:36:12] to stay out of politics within the
[1:36:15] message
[1:36:17] amen
[1:36:19] and become a great man and what's only
[1:36:21] too glad to do so
[1:36:23] but seeing that he had to he had to
[1:36:27] approach to and receive an audience from
[1:36:30] God to get the people cursed as he could
[1:36:32] not do it by himself
[1:36:34] and he went to ask God if he could have
[1:36:37] permission to go
[1:36:38] Now isn't that just like the nickel
[1:36:42] Layton's we have with us today they
[1:36:45] curse everyone that won't go their way
[1:36:52] continuing on paragraph 204.
[1:36:55] balak was very angry but there was
[1:36:58] nothing that Balaam could do about
[1:36:59] prophecy
[1:37:01] it had been spoken by the Holy Ghost
[1:37:04] so balak told Balaam to go down there
[1:37:07] into the valley look into their back
[1:37:09] parts and see if there was it possibly
[1:37:11] some way he could curse them the tactics
[1:37:15] that Billy used are the same tactics
[1:37:18] they used today big denominations look
[1:37:22] down at the little groups and anything
[1:37:24] they find amongst them to make out a
[1:37:27] candle they bring it out and shout it if
[1:37:31] the moderns live in sin no one says
[1:37:34] anything about it let me tell you let me
[1:37:36] stop there for just a moment
[1:37:38] big denominations
[1:37:40] are feel-good churches you can live any
[1:37:44] kind of life you want to live you
[1:37:47] sisters can cut your hair you can color
[1:37:49] it you can dress like Jezebel and guess
[1:37:52] what nobody condemns you no wonder
[1:37:55] people say when they oh my I left a
[1:37:58] message all them critical people around
[1:38:00] there and everybody talking about me
[1:38:03] you know why because you can get out
[1:38:05] there with those and they won't get
[1:38:08] critical at you they won't criticize you
[1:38:10] why because they're guilty too
[1:38:15] birds of a feather
[1:38:18] up
[1:38:19] flock together
[1:38:22] so now watch this
[1:38:24] but let one of the elect get into
[1:38:26] trouble and every paper blasted across
[1:38:28] the country
[1:38:30] yes Israel had her back carnal parts
[1:38:33] they had their side that wasn't
[1:38:36] praiseworthy but in spite of their
[1:38:39] imperfections
[1:38:40] by the purpose of God that works through
[1:38:43] election
[1:38:45] by grace and not by works
[1:38:48] they had the cloud by day and a pillar
[1:38:51] of Fire by night they had the smitten
[1:38:54] Rock the Brazen Serpent and the signs
[1:38:57] and wonders they were Vindicated not in
[1:38:59] themselves
[1:39:01] but in God
[1:39:06] let me stop here for just a minute
[1:39:09] let me just take away your Halo
[1:39:12] and understand that all of you have got
[1:39:14] a backside
[1:39:16] all of you have got things that are not
[1:39:18] praiseworthy all of you have got your
[1:39:21] mistakes and your failures and you know
[1:39:23] it
[1:39:25] and you don't want anybody to know what
[1:39:27] you've done wrong you don't want anybody
[1:39:29] to watch what you put on Instagram you
[1:39:32] don't want everybody to know what you
[1:39:33] watched last night
[1:39:36] what you were looking at on the internet
[1:39:39] what you were going through you don't
[1:39:42] want it put up here on the screen of
[1:39:44] your thoughts and the things that you
[1:39:46] said and the things that you have said
[1:39:48] about everybody hey some of you are
[1:39:51] liars some of you are hypocrites some of
[1:39:54] you are fornicators some of you are
[1:39:56] seducers but
[1:39:59] there is a smitten Rock
[1:40:02] there is a blood that covers you
[1:40:05] and how dare we look her
[1:40:08] self-righteous noses down that's
[1:40:11] somebody else
[1:40:13] if it weren't for the grace of God there
[1:40:15] go you
[1:40:20] which one of you are without sin which
[1:40:24] one of you can say I'm not guilty I
[1:40:27] haven't I can prove to you why even the
[1:40:30] Apostle Paul said concerning the law
[1:40:33] blameless he said a Pharisee of
[1:40:36] Pharisees and yet when God allowed him
[1:40:39] to come into the presence of almighty
[1:40:43] God and he saw the pillar of fire and he
[1:40:46] was cast to the ground he said Lord who
[1:40:49] are thou he said I'm Jesus and then Paul
[1:40:52] said oh my all of my religious teaching
[1:40:56] all of that former stuff is nothing but
[1:40:59] dung I've lost all things
[1:41:02] that I might gain Christ
[1:41:10] Paul said
[1:41:13] I was the chiefest of sinners
[1:41:17] you think he was lying
[1:41:19] you know Paul didn't expose all the
[1:41:22] things that he did wrong but him being a
[1:41:25] church age messenger and him speaking
[1:41:28] truth he said I was the chiefess of
[1:41:30] Sinner he says oh the things that I
[1:41:33] would do I do not the things that I
[1:41:34] would not do that I do oh wretched vile
[1:41:38] man that I am who shall deliver me from
[1:41:41] this body of death
[1:41:44] because in me lives no good thing except
[1:41:48] that God put it there
[1:41:57] looking at the backside of Israel
[1:42:00] looking at the backside of the Bride
[1:42:05] she has her hinder parts
[1:42:07] she has her things that she has done
[1:42:09] wrong
[1:42:10] but I want to bring you all back to
[1:42:12] understand
[1:42:14] God is not looking
[1:42:16] at faults and failures
[1:42:19] he's looking at the blood
[1:42:21] how many of you say it's blood
[1:42:24] because there's only one thing that
[1:42:25] stands between me and judgment and
[1:42:27] that's blood and every time that I do
[1:42:29] wrong and I ask God to forgive me and I
[1:42:32] put it under the blood guess what God
[1:42:34] don't even remember it's placed into the
[1:42:37] sea of God's forgetfulness but the
[1:42:40] problem is you remember
[1:42:43] you remember what you did you remember
[1:42:46] in the Satan is an accuser of the
[1:42:48] Brethren and when you forget he reminds
[1:42:51] you
[1:42:58] Romans 8 verse 33.
[1:43:02] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:43:04] God's elect
[1:43:08] it is God that justify it
[1:43:12] who is he that condemneth
[1:43:15] it is Christ that died
[1:43:18] yea rather that is risen again who is
[1:43:21] even at the right hand of God who also
[1:43:23] make an intercession for us
[1:43:28] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:43:31] Christ
[1:43:33] shall tribulation
[1:43:36] sell distress persecution
[1:43:38] famine
[1:43:40] nakedness
[1:43:42] peril
[1:43:44] or sword all of these are terrible
[1:43:47] situations
[1:43:50] as it is written for thy sink
[1:43:53] we are killed all the day long
[1:43:56] we are accounted as sheep
[1:43:59] for the slaughter nay in all these
[1:44:01] sayings all these things
[1:44:03] look at that in Tribulation distress
[1:44:07] persecution famine nakedness
[1:44:09] in all these things
[1:44:12] we are more than conquerors through him
[1:44:16] that loved us for I am persuaded
[1:44:21] are you persuaded this morning
[1:44:25] then why do you doubt God's elect love
[1:44:28] when you're in distress when you're in
[1:44:31] persecution when you're in Peril when
[1:44:34] you're in nakedness when you're in the
[1:44:36] trials of this life you know what God
[1:44:39] Saul so fit and you to be worthy to be
[1:44:44] tested
[1:44:48] he had faith in you like he did job
[1:44:52] have you considered my servant job
[1:45:01] suffered so much in the flesh he said I
[1:45:04] cursed the day
[1:45:05] I was born it would have been better
[1:45:07] that I didn't come forth from the womb
[1:45:10] And yet when it was all said and done
[1:45:14] he said when God is finished with me I
[1:45:18] shall come forth
[1:45:19] a spherical
[1:45:21] and in my flesh
[1:45:24] I shall see him
[1:45:28] amen
[1:45:30] yes
[1:45:35] for I'm persuaded neither death nor life
[1:45:38] nor angels
[1:45:40] nor principalities nor powers nor things
[1:45:42] present nor things to come
[1:45:45] nor height nor depth nor any other
[1:45:48] creature
[1:45:49] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:45:51] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:45:55] lord
[1:45:57] Hallelujah
[1:46:01] I love him today
[1:46:04] now watch this in the Sumerian Church
[1:46:06] age
[1:46:07] now the Lord God Almighty says I know
[1:46:12] there he is walking in the midst of the
[1:46:14] people there he is
[1:46:16] the chief Shepherd of the flock
[1:46:20] but does he hold back persecution
[1:46:24] does he stem the tribulation
[1:46:28] no he does not
[1:46:32] he simply says I know your tribulation
[1:46:38] and I am not unmindful of your suffering
[1:46:44] what a stumbling block that is to so
[1:46:47] many people
[1:46:49] like Israel they wonder if God really
[1:46:51] loves them
[1:46:53] is God speaking to somebody here this
[1:46:55] morning I believe that sometimes
[1:46:57] distressed Peril famine issues trials
[1:47:01] sickness come through and there and it
[1:47:04] comes in and your mind becomes so
[1:47:07] trouble that you forget it does God
[1:47:10] really love me
[1:47:14] thank you
[1:47:15] how can God be just and loving
[1:47:19] if he stands by and watches his people
[1:47:21] suffer
[1:47:24] that's what it was asked in Malachi 1.
[1:47:27] verses one and three the burden of the
[1:47:29] word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi
[1:47:32] I have loved you who saith the Lord
[1:47:35] yet we say wherein has thou loved us
[1:47:39] was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the
[1:47:41] Lord yet I love Jacob
[1:47:44] and I hated Esau
[1:47:47] and laid his mountains in his Heritage
[1:47:49] waste for the dragons of the wilderness
[1:47:53] you see they could not figure out God's
[1:47:55] love
[1:47:57] they thought that love meant no
[1:47:58] suffering
[1:48:00] they thought that love meant a baby with
[1:48:03] parental care
[1:48:05] but God said that his love was elective
[1:48:12] the proof of his love
[1:48:16] that no matter what happened his love
[1:48:19] was proven
[1:48:20] truly by the fact that they were chosen
[1:48:23] unto salvation because God hath chosen
[1:48:26] you
[1:48:27] to Salvation through sanctification of
[1:48:30] the spirit and belief of the truth
[1:48:34] he may commit you to death as he did
[1:48:37] Paul
[1:48:39] he may commit you to suffering as he did
[1:48:43] job
[1:48:45] that is his prerogative
[1:48:49] he is
[1:48:51] sovereign
[1:48:54] but it is all with a purpose
[1:48:58] if he did not have a purpose then he
[1:49:01] would be the author of spray of
[1:49:04] frustration and not of peace
[1:49:07] his purpose is that after we have
[1:49:10] suffered a while
[1:49:13] we would be made perfect be established
[1:49:16] strengthened settled as job said he put
[1:49:19] strength in US
[1:49:21] you see
[1:49:23] he himself suffered he learned obedience
[1:49:25] by the things he suffered he was
[1:49:27] actually made perfect by the things
[1:49:30] he suffered
[1:49:34] now the Bible shows us
[1:49:38] from Genesis to Revelation all of the
[1:49:40] faults and failures mistakes lies
[1:49:43] adulteries
[1:49:44] issues of the elect
[1:49:50] is that right
[1:49:53] and thank God he does
[1:49:58] because God allows you to see that
[1:50:01] mankind has issues
[1:50:05] mankind has backsides
[1:50:09] but may we never
[1:50:14] not look at the
[1:50:16] smitten Rock
[1:50:18] may we always put our eyes to Calvary
[1:50:29] when we look at Israel in the natural
[1:50:33] why when you go through Genesis Exodus
[1:50:35] Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy and you
[1:50:38] begin to see it it's just a matter of
[1:50:41] time and Israel makes mistake after
[1:50:44] mistake and golden calf and this and
[1:50:47] that and my oh my they just false and
[1:50:50] failures and yet he says I have loved
[1:50:54] Israel
[1:50:56] they are mine they're my elect they are
[1:50:59] my chosen
[1:51:00] I have chosen them I've put my elective
[1:51:04] love
[1:51:05] upon them
[1:51:09] the Bible says
[1:51:11] Those whom he did for no he did also
[1:51:14] predestinate because God is omniscient
[1:51:16] he's all-knowing he knows the end from
[1:51:19] the beginning
[1:51:20] he knows who will believe and who will
[1:51:22] betray him
[1:51:26] in the sermon the Seal of God
[1:51:29] 1954
[1:51:31] I'm not condemning Catholic people
[1:51:34] I'm not condemning Protestant
[1:51:37] people for out of both and all of them
[1:51:40] comes the seed of God
[1:51:43] by election how many of you before you
[1:51:45] became a message believer were catholic
[1:51:48] raise your hand you were catholic you
[1:51:50] were raised up in the Catholic yeah
[1:51:52] raise your hand
[1:51:57] how many of you were Protestant
[1:52:02] yeah yeah
[1:52:03] how many of you were in some kind of
[1:52:05] denomination before you came to this
[1:52:09] and yet God
[1:52:11] rich in Mercy
[1:52:15] in all of them the system
[1:52:18] there is God's seed
[1:52:22] those who are ordained alive will see it
[1:52:25] and walk in it
[1:52:27] those who cannot see walk in darkness
[1:52:30] that's up to God God does it
[1:52:33] he swore and promised Abraham he would
[1:52:36] save him in his seat if you got
[1:52:37] Abraham's seed you got eternal life
[1:52:39] that's all
[1:52:41] on your heirs according to the promise
[1:52:43] and it's all by grace and by the
[1:52:45] election of God
[1:52:50] Grace and election go hand in hand
[1:52:53] with predestination
[1:52:58] both of which over emphasize may I play
[1:53:02] this side of the record for a moment
[1:53:04] any truth that is overemphasized
[1:53:09] will present a distorted picture
[1:53:13] well I'll tell you what you are so
[1:53:15] predestinated of God you are the elect
[1:53:18] you are the order hallelujah amen and
[1:53:22] fireworks and and people living in sin
[1:53:32] the doctrine of eternal security taught
[1:53:34] by denominations
[1:53:36] is wrong but there is a real Biblical
[1:53:39] truth about eternal security
[1:53:42] but let me show you what brother Brahm
[1:53:44] says in the sermon serpent seed
[1:53:47] Baptists come in baptize a couple people
[1:53:50] over here in immersing the preacher
[1:53:52] baptizes nine out of ten Smoked
[1:53:55] Cigarettes go back out stand out there
[1:53:57] play cards bunkle all night run around
[1:53:59] crooked business deals
[1:54:02] and all the women wearing shorts out
[1:54:04] there running around on streets bobbing
[1:54:06] their hair smoking talking a little
[1:54:07] stitching Soul parties telling dirty
[1:54:10] jokes
[1:54:11] you call that Christianity you think
[1:54:14] you've got eternal security you're going
[1:54:16] to hell like that you won't enjoy
[1:54:19] yourself in heaven in any manner
[1:54:21] certainly not that's not eternal
[1:54:23] security oh thank God that we had a
[1:54:27] minister come and take away the blinders
[1:54:30] of denomination off of her eyes and let
[1:54:33] us see the truth of God's word
[1:54:37] that don't mean you got eternal security
[1:54:39] don't you ever get that in your mind he
[1:54:42] talks about you Pentecostals because you
[1:54:44] jump them down spoke in tongues run
[1:54:46] around the aisle that don't mean you got
[1:54:47] eternal security

[1:55:07] love and he loves everything and
[1:55:09] everybody you're preaching a distorted
[1:55:11] gospel
[1:55:12] when you preach that there is no devil

[1:55:16] gospel
[1:55:18] election and predestination over
[1:55:21] emphasized
[1:55:23] our subject listen of over emphasizing
[1:55:27] that causes you to become lopsided
[1:55:32] in a way a man leans
[1:55:35] is the way he falls
[1:55:37] you see among the men a lot of message
[1:55:40] churches today the only way you can get
[1:55:43] people to jump and Shout is to just talk
[1:55:46] about election and predestination and
[1:55:49] being ordained and you've heard the
[1:55:52] voice of God and on and on and it
[1:55:55] becomes a little pep rally ain't that
[1:55:57] the truth yeah yeah
[1:55:59] people get excited over all kinds of
[1:56:02] things

[1:56:10] would invite you and it was like Amway

[1:57:03] what's money got to do with it
[1:57:09] let me tell you this I love this about
[1:57:11] this message brother REM said God don't
[1:57:13] want your money
[1:57:15] he wants you
[1:57:16] because when he's got you
[1:57:19] he's got your money
[1:57:22] is that right
[1:57:24] amen some of you are so tight
[1:57:28] huh

[1:57:32] with the money that God gives you and
[1:57:35] you give so sparingly back
[1:57:40] you show me a man that God is blessing
[1:57:42] in many different ways I'll show you a
[1:57:44] man that pays more than he owes in ties
[1:57:48] because God says prove me
[1:57:51] well I you know I look I made fifteen
[1:57:54] hundred dollars I'm gonna pay right 150
[1:57:56] bucks not 151 not 152 150.

[1:58:06] well I had to buy a car I had to do this
[1:58:08] and I got this and that so it's an
[1:58:10] adjusted income
[1:58:16] yeah oh
[1:58:19] some of you are liars and thieves
[1:58:22] didn't it say it in Malachi
[1:58:25] how am I a liar and thief and you robbed
[1:58:29] me

[1:58:36] God and if you can't handle that huh if
[1:58:38] that's stepping on your toes well so
[1:58:41] listen you can't say Amen say ouch
[1:58:44] it's the truth
[1:58:46] tithes is what you owe God offering is
[1:58:50] above and beyond you can't even give an
[1:58:52] offering until you've paid your ties
[1:58:55] is that right
[1:58:57] somebody say Amen somebody say go on
[1:58:59] preacher okay all right
[1:59:02] I just said it that's okay you told me
[1:59:04] to go on I will
[1:59:07] anything over emphasized
[1:59:10] huh how can you teach trigonometry
[1:59:14] to those who only know basic mathematics
[1:59:18] huh how can you teach the truth on
[1:59:23] predestination and election
[1:59:26] when they are such young believers
[1:59:29] the Bible says that strong meat belongs
[1:59:31] to those who are a full age who can
[1:59:34] understand it when you talk about
[1:59:36] election and predestination it's not for
[1:59:39] the new it's not for the young it is for
[1:59:42] the elected and those who are mature in
[1:59:45] Christ who can handle it it will not
[1:59:48] abuse it
[1:59:56] early spiritual experiences
[1:59:59] 1952
[2:00:03] because the world makes fun of you
[2:00:05] because you've got something out there
[2:00:07] people criticize you
[2:00:09] they did the same thing about Israel
[2:00:12] didn't the false prophet Balaam thought
[2:00:15] surely that God would curse Israel
[2:00:17] because they'd done just as much as the
[2:00:20] Holiness as churches done today
[2:00:23] every unclean thing that could be done
[2:00:26] and could be done they did it
[2:00:30] every Balaam failed to see the blood on
[2:00:32] the altar
[2:00:33] he failed to see the atonement that was
[2:00:35] that was standing between Israel
[2:00:40] and here's where it is today people
[2:00:46] you were God called and chosen
[2:00:49] I am not ashamed to make myself with you
[2:00:54] I am numbered
[2:00:57] with you
[2:00:59] Hallelujah
[2:01:02] Israel and the church
[2:01:04] Balaam thought surely if Israel had done
[2:01:07] wrong
[2:01:09] they did do wrong they done everything
[2:01:12] in God's calendar wrong nearly
[2:01:15] but what Balaam thought
[2:01:17] that a holy God would surely curse of
[2:01:19] people that had done that much wrong
[2:01:22] he thought surely God will do it
[2:01:24] so when he got down there he was so much
[2:01:26] money crazy until he couldn't see
[2:01:29] what the reason that God wasn't cursing
[2:01:31] them
[2:01:32] and every time he tried to curse him he
[2:01:34] would bless him
[2:01:35] he threw out his prophecy like that and
[2:01:37] go forth and take up his mantle in his
[2:01:39] Parable instead of cursing it be a
[2:01:41] blessing fall back to them how righteous
[2:01:44] are they tense o Israel how great they
[2:01:46] was instead of cursing
[2:01:48] it was a blessing
[2:01:55] unconditional Covenant that God made
[2:01:57] with his people now stop here for a
[2:01:59] moment because this sermon title speaks
[2:02:01] volumes
[2:02:02] unconditional Covenant
[2:02:05] remember brother Graham says that God
[2:02:07] made covenants he made a covenant with
[2:02:08] Adam he broke it he made a covenant with
[2:02:11] Noah he broke it he made a covenant with
[2:02:13] different ones and down man cannot keep
[2:02:15] his Covenant with God so when he comes
[2:02:17] to Abraham he said Abraham it's not what
[2:02:20] you will do for me it's what I have done
[2:02:22] for you
[2:02:28] and unconditional
[2:02:31] now an unconditional does not mean that
[2:02:33] you go out here and you just live any
[2:02:35] kind of life you want to because you
[2:02:36] know it's unconditional no
[2:02:39] let me tell you the more that God shows
[2:02:41] you of his love
[2:02:43] and how that he gave you this Covenant
[2:02:45] the more you want to serve him
[2:02:47] he said if you love me you would
[2:02:54] if you love me
[2:02:58] you keep my commandment
[2:03:06] Peter
[2:03:08] do you love me
[2:03:11] yes Lord you know I love you
[2:03:16] Peter
[2:03:19] love us thou me
[2:03:23] yes Lord
[2:03:25] you know I
[2:03:27] know what Peter
[2:03:30] do you really
[2:03:32] love me and the Bible says and Peter
[2:03:34] being grieved in his spirit
[2:03:38] he said Lord you know I love you and he
[2:03:43] said feed my sheep
[2:03:49] he didn't say fleece my sheep
[2:03:52] he said he didn't say take advantage of
[2:03:55] my sheep
[2:03:56] he said feed my
[2:03:59] sheep
[2:04:01] that's what every Pastor is commissioned
[2:04:04] of God to do to go into that word and to
[2:04:09] find those golden nuggets and those
[2:04:12] little things huh that's so so uh
[2:04:16] illuminate you so Quicken you that when
[2:04:19] you hear it you say that's nothing but
[2:04:22] the truth
[2:04:23] and watch when you start lining up and
[2:04:26] see what I heard over the pulpit and
[2:04:29] what I have heard in my mind of what
[2:04:31] I've read in God's word and what God's
[2:04:33] Prophet have said I can say that's
[2:04:35] nothing but the truth and watch
[2:04:40] I tell you what we'll have a whole lot
[2:04:42] more of the Holy Spirit coming down and
[2:04:45] vindicating his word if you'll just line
[2:04:47] up and say that ain't nothing but the
[2:04:49] truth I may not understand it all but I
[2:04:52] believe it all
[2:04:54] somebody say that's the truth
[2:05:06] Israel in the church 1953 skipping a
[2:05:10] couple things here if you don't mind
[2:05:15] now
[2:05:17] before you became a Christian
[2:05:21] God called you
[2:05:24] before
[2:05:27] you became a Christian
[2:05:30] God called you
[2:05:32] not you calling God God called you
[2:05:35] now he called Abraham and he's the
[2:05:37] father of us all the faith now notice he
[2:05:39] said Abraham now it's election I I want
[2:05:43] to get on that election strong because
[2:05:45] it's the truth
[2:05:47] now you didn't become a Christian just
[2:05:50] coincidence
[2:05:52] because you become a Christian
[2:05:54] before you was in this world
[2:05:58] before you were born
[2:06:04] he adore he ordained you to be a
[2:06:08] Christian from the Garden of Eden from
[2:06:10] before the foundation
[2:06:13] of the world
[2:06:16] oh my God
[2:06:21] who am I
[2:06:30] this is not skim milk Saints
[2:06:34] this is for
[2:06:35] the advanced students
[2:06:38] the accelerated class
[2:06:45] second Thessalonians 2.
[2:06:48] verses 13 and 14 but we are now bound to
[2:06:51] give thanks away to God for you
[2:06:55] brethren
[2:06:56] beloved of the Lord because
[2:06:59] God hath from the beginning
[2:07:03] chosen you to Salvation through
[2:07:05] sanctification of the spirit
[2:07:08] and belief of the truth
[2:07:10] where unto I called you
[2:07:13] by Our Gospel
[2:07:15] to the obtaining of the glory of our
[2:07:18] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:07:21] you
[2:07:23] were born
[2:07:25] to receive the word of God for this hour
[2:07:35] my hands were made
[2:07:39] to help my brother
[2:07:43] my eyes were made to read God's word
[2:07:50] my feet were made
[2:07:54] to walk
[2:07:56] in his footsteps
[2:07:59] for I was born
[2:08:02] to serve the Lord
[2:08:06] oh I wish I could sing I would sing you
[2:08:09] that song
[2:08:14] I am
[2:08:16] that song
[2:08:21] I was born
[2:08:23] to receive this message no wonder when I
[2:08:27] heard the voice of Malachi 4 something
[2:08:30] inside of me said my God no man speak
[2:08:34] like this man it wasn't the voice of
[2:08:37] William Branham there was a voice Beyond
[2:08:39] the Veil there was something there was a
[2:08:42] picture within the picture
[2:08:47] one saw a man and another saw God and
[2:08:50] they were both right
[2:08:53] I ask you what did you see
[2:08:55] a reed shaking in the Wind
[2:09:04] Hallelujah
[2:09:07] first excuse me John 1 verses 12 through
[2:09:10] 13.
[2:09:13] but as many as received him
[2:09:19] to them
[2:09:21] gave he power to become the sons of God
[2:09:26] even to them that believe on his name
[2:09:29] which were born
[2:09:31] not of blood
[2:09:34] nor of the will of the flesh
[2:09:37] nor of the will of man
[2:09:40] but of God
[2:09:44] you see he that believeth not is
[2:09:46] condemned already
[2:09:48] you see I don't believe it it's not for
[2:09:51] you
[2:09:52] it's for those who believe
[2:09:59] a couple more quotes and I'm going to
[2:10:01] close here
[2:10:04] this is a good one possessing the gates
[2:10:07] of the end they're all good they're all
[2:10:08] good
[2:10:11] it's like William William Andy says this
[2:10:14] is good stuff I believe it every time I
[2:10:17] put on a tape Sandy and I listen we go
[2:10:19] man that's good
[2:10:22] so that's espresso man that's a quad
[2:10:25] shot man
[2:10:27] [Music]
[2:10:30] yeah yeah when was the last time you had
[2:10:32] a quad shot and it just it just
[2:10:34] quickened you man hey you know you've
[2:10:35] been slumped over you've been having a
[2:10:37] hard day get a quad shot man man I'll
[2:10:40] tell you what bring it on buddy
[2:10:43] oh
[2:10:45] all right here's a quad shot
[2:10:48] now we see God cannot say anything or
[2:10:51] make any promises until unless he will
[2:10:54] fulfill it he has to do that in order to
[2:10:56] be God years later
[2:10:58] when the same people the promised people
[2:11:00] the seat of Abraham was on their journey
[2:11:02] into a Promised Land There was a gate
[2:11:04] who stood up against him and it was his
[2:11:08] own brother Moab who said you'll not
[2:11:10] cross my land I'll see to that you'll
[2:11:12] not cross my land if our cows lick any
[2:11:15] of our grass your grass or if they drink
[2:11:18] in your water we'll pay you for it he
[2:11:20] said you'll not cross the land but God's
[2:11:22] promise held true
[2:11:25] so they went got their Prophet Balaam
[2:11:28] and brought him down to curse the people
[2:11:30] and here's what he said they tried to
[2:11:32] show him the worst part of the Blessed
[2:11:35] seed but God showed him
[2:11:40] the best part of it
[2:11:45] he said ever who curses Israel shall be
[2:11:48] cursed and whoever blesses him will be
[2:11:51] blessed let me tell you how can you
[2:11:54] curse what God has blessed
[2:12:03] amen
[2:12:08] musicians if you come I'm closing
[2:12:11] passing up a cover culture
[2:12:19] the reason those that leave the message
[2:12:21] have to find fault with those that still
[2:12:23] believe in
[2:12:27] so they can release the pressure of the
[2:12:29] guilt
[2:12:31] they have from turning aside
[2:12:36] this one's a hypocrite
[2:12:38] this one said this this one why those
[2:12:41] people out there they're better
[2:12:43] Christians than these messaged Believers
[2:12:46] I beg to differ with you
[2:12:52] I'm sorry
[2:12:55] I take sides with Gods he left
[2:13:00] brother Brennan says
[2:13:03] he says I take sides with you
[2:13:05] I'm glad to be numbered among you
[2:13:08] huh because they they out there are they
[2:13:11] going to condemn anyone for cutting
[2:13:14] their hair
[2:13:16] wearing immoral dresses
[2:13:19] saying filthy things
[2:13:21] divorce and remarriage are they going to
[2:13:23] say anything about it no they just want
[2:13:26] numbers because numbers means money it's
[2:13:31] it's denominational
[2:13:33] and I defy anybody I don't care who it
[2:13:37] comes from
[2:13:38] you sit there and you wanna whether you
[2:13:41] put it down yeah I'll tell you what some
[2:13:43] of you you are hypocrites yeah some of
[2:13:45] you you are liars yeah some of you have
[2:13:48] done these things wrong but I'm not
[2:13:50] looking at your backside that's the
[2:13:54] critical way of Balaam I want to look at
[2:13:57] the better part I want to look and say
[2:14:00] oh yeah he did wrong she did wrong yes
[2:14:03] that was a hypocrite that's true but do
[2:14:06] we not all have a backside do we not all
[2:14:10] have a part we want to have it covered
[2:14:13] oh God cover me don't let people see my
[2:14:17] backside I want to be under the blood of
[2:14:21] Christ I want my Advocate I want my
[2:14:24] mediator

[2:14:47] the Bible says in James 2 verses 10 and
[2:14:50] 11 whosoever shall keep the whole law
[2:14:52] and yet offend in one point
[2:14:56] he's guilty of all

[2:15:27] that there is not one righteous in Among
[2:15:30] Us

[2:15:35] but I'm not looking to that
[2:15:37] I'm looking to the smitten Rock
[2:15:40] I'm looking to Calvary I'm looking to
[2:15:42] the one
[2:15:46] who covers all my sins
[2:15:51] [Music]
[2:16:04] the Bible says that a double-minded man
[2:16:06] is unstable in all his ways
[2:16:11] I want you to all understand this and I
[2:16:13] bring this to a close
[2:16:15] and I'm sorry that I I went here and
[2:16:18] there

[2:17:23] I'll tell you my brother my sister
[2:17:26] my rest is in him
[2:17:29] and I have to lay all of this down at
[2:17:31] his feet and say
[2:17:32] [Music]
[2:17:34] that he can be touched
[2:17:36] by the feeling
[2:17:37] [Music]
[2:17:40] of my infirmity

[2:17:47] how are you doing Ron
[2:17:54] man don't ask
[2:17:58] how are you doing
[2:18:02] because sometimes I'll tell you the
[2:18:04] weight

[2:18:13] Rock
[2:18:14] and I fall upon the rock which is a
