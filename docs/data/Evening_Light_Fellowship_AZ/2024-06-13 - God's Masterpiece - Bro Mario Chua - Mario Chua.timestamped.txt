[8:37] hundred yesterday he informed us that

[8:48] to our lord
[8:49] Jesus so I'm just thankful for what the
[8:52] Lord did for this young man and may
[8:54] somehow speak to him through all of this
[8:56] anden brother Ezra is asking that we
[8:59] remember remember him in prayer he throw

[9:03] Lord would touch brother Ezra and

[9:51] [Music]
[9:53] come praise the
[9:55] Lord I was glad when they said unto me
[9:59] let us go to the house of the Lord is
[10:01] that what your heart was telling you
[10:02] tonight I'm sure many of you tired and
[10:05] actually driving in to church a little
[10:07] while ago and my wife said uh you going
[10:10] to turn in your praise report and I said
[10:14] what what praise report she goes your
[10:17] elbow I said oh
[10:19] yeah that's right and then I got here
[10:22] and guess what I didn't
[10:24] do I didn't turn in my praise report so
[10:27] I guess the Lord knows that he was
[10:28] wanting me to tell this this a little
[10:30] testimony 3 years ago I come up for
[10:33] prayer and my body has been cursed with
[10:36] arthritis a bad my joints my back and
[10:39] shoulder and neck hands and it just
[10:42] knots and and I come up for prayer and
[10:44] I've been taking medicine and you know
[10:45] that stuff just eats your stomach up and
[10:48] all these things so you take a pill for
[10:50] that and then you take another pill for
[10:51] the stomach and you done this for years
[10:55] and and uh every time you get the MRI
[10:58] they say oh this just arthritis and it's
[11:00] getting worse and you know how it goes
[11:02] so I come up for prayer 3 years ago and
[11:04] I claimed my healing then and God had
[11:07] led me into some different things in my
[11:09] wife and put different people in our
[11:11] lives different remedies and things that
[11:13] all kind of seemed to work together in
[11:15] my body and hadn't taken no medicine for
[11:18] a long time and then all of a sudden
[11:20] seemed like on
[11:23] Saturday just Cat come scratching at the
[11:27] door and boy I tell you this arm was
[11:30] hurting so bad I just couldn't even
[11:32] hardly Sunday morning lift a cup of
[11:34] coffee and I come up ask brother Ron to
[11:37] pray again and we got home and she goes
[11:40] what did you get prayer for and I said
[11:42] you know that elbow and I thought that
[11:45] elbow thank you
[11:47] Lord that elbow that
[11:51] shoulder that hand look at that you know
[11:54] amen
[11:56] so God still moves Saints
[11:59] [Music]
[12:01] the devil can come knocking but he's
[12:02] just a bluff the prophet told us right
[12:05] so we got needs tonight we got pray
[12:07] reports we got needs sister
[12:09] Sandy brother Ezra and he's
[12:12] back anybody that's ever suffered but we
[12:15] know when Jesus said it's
[12:18] finished he didn't say
[12:20] maybe he didn't say might he said it is
[12:26] the whole
[12:27] work everything Redemption healing if
[12:30] you can believe you're saved you can
[12:31] believe you're healed it all was
[12:33] completed he done it all in that one act
[12:36] and I tell you I believe it all we need
[12:38] to reach out with faith tonight and say
[12:41] Lord I take what you've done for me
[12:43] already it's already done folks it's
[12:45] already done let's pray Heavenly
[12:54] Father we come to you this evening Lord
[12:56] a needy people there was hands up my
[12:58] hand was raised there's always something
[13:01] Lord but that's what makes you
[13:04] God it's what makes you mighty the
[13:07] almighty God is
[13:10] because when we have a need we have a
[13:14] place to run
[13:16] to there is a bomb in
[13:19] Gilead and oh

[35:43] degrees so it's just like winter and but

[35:50] cold but full of sunshine it's really
[35:53] nice praise God and I trust that uh the
[35:56] Lord will uh be with us tonight and also
[36:00] I want to acknowledge the mendosa family
[36:04] for giving me a wonderful gift this the
[36:07] handkerchief with a letter C I try to
[36:10] keep it as a souvenir and just look at
[36:13] it but I realize that it will not serve
[36:16] its purpose if I just display it so I as
[36:19] well using it tonight so thank you the
[36:21] mosa family praise God and uh we will go
[36:26] just Direct to the word of God tonight
[36:29] and I think that's the most important
[36:31] thing and I have two portion of
[36:35] scriptures uh the first one Zechariah
[36:38] 13: 6 and Luke 17 verse
[36:52] 25 Zechariah 13:6 said and one shall say
[36:56] unto him what are these wounds in thine
[37:00] hand then he shall answers those with
[37:03] which I was wounded in the house of my
[37:06] friends Luke
[37:08] 17 verse
[37:11] 25 but first must he suffer many things
[37:15] and be rejected of these Generations so
[37:19] my title is God's
[37:21] Masterpiece and the subject is the
[37:24] rejected king and the SMI and bride and
[37:27] may the Lord are a blessing upon the
[37:28] reading of his word you may now be
[37:31] seated so the rejected king and the SMI
[37:35] bride and we know that God has mostly
[37:38] always been rejected by men as
[37:41] king it seems like man chose to rulle
[37:44] over by anything else but
[37:47] God he'll be ruled over by his drug
[37:50] habit he will be ruled over by his
[37:52] passion he will ruled over by his
[37:56] denominations he'll be ruled over by
[37:58] opinions of others or his own
[38:01] philosophy about life but he'll even try
[38:05] to be his own God and King and ruled and
[38:08] Lead
[38:09] himself but we find that all of his
[38:12] leadership only lead him to disaster and
[38:16] death because anything outside of the
[38:19] leadership of the Holy Ghost will only
[38:21] lead a men to
[38:23] ruination we cannot lead by our own self
[38:27] in amen we need God above all things so
[38:30] in 1 Samuel
[38:32] 8:7 speaking about Samuel which is the
[38:35] prophet of God Amen and the Lord said
[38:37] unto Samuel herken unto the voice of the
[38:40] people in all they in all that they say
[38:42] unto thee for they have not rejected
[38:45] thee but they have rejected me that I
[38:47] should not Reign Over them remember that
[38:50] Prophet always a prophet always
[38:53] represent God to the people amen where
[38:56] in the priest represent present the
[38:57] people to God then the prophet represent
[39:00] praise God and the prophet represent God
[39:03] to the people so every time that the
[39:05] prophet uh speak the word it must always
[39:09] be thus said the Lord amen so sometimes
[39:12] people reject the
[39:14] prophet and when they reject the prophet
[39:17] they're not re actually rejecting the
[39:19] person but they are actually rejecting
[39:22] God Amen so in these last days every sin
[39:26] can be forgiven by the time you
[39:28] blaspheme the Holy Ghost it cannot be
[39:30] forgiven anymore and we know that the
[39:33] prophet in these last days is the Holy
[39:34] Ghost amen amen so when Christ came he
[39:37] was also a rejected King because when he
[39:40] came to his own his own received him not
[39:44] in John 1 verse 10- 11 he was in the
[39:48] world and the world was made by him and
[39:50] the world knew him not he came unto his
[39:53] own and his own praise God with received
[39:57] him and his own rejected
[40:01] him this is always the case amen and the
[40:05] greatest thing that can hurt our our our
[40:08] our heart is the one that is near to
[40:13] us and we will notice that he was Lov by
[40:16] God but falsely falsely accused and
[40:18] rejected by his Brethren just like
[40:21] Joseph he was loved by his his father
[40:24] but he was rejected by his brethren
[40:27] and also the bride in this last days
[40:29] praise God we are loved by God by
[40:31] revealing to us the word but we are
[40:33] rejected by all denominational in this
[40:35] word amen in Zechariah we can say in
[40:39] Chapter 13 Verse uh 6 and one shall say
[40:43] unto him what are these wound in thy
[40:45] hand then he shall answer those with
[40:47] which I was wounded in the house of my
[40:50] friends so we see the same thing taking
[40:52] place even in the Book of
[40:55] Job and we know that God never Chang his
[40:58] pattern if there is a pattern there is
[41:00] always a continuity of that amen every
[41:03] time we see it in the old Old Testament
[41:05] we can apply in our today so when God
[41:08] was reject so is so was job job was a
[41:11] righteous man but when God tried him all
[41:14] his friend that he he is relying to
[41:17] comfort him in time with strouble is the
[41:19] one that rejected him and accuse him as
[41:22] a a secret
[41:24] sinner but we know that joob knew that
[41:27] he had offered the appropriate burnt
[41:29] offering to God on behalf of his sin and
[41:33] and we know that job himself was also a
[41:35] symbol and form of the burnt offering he
[41:37] became a Living Sacrifice in that hour
[41:40] because we see that everything that job
[41:42] possessed had been taken from him his
[41:45] business his finances his family his
[41:47] children
[41:49] everything Hallelujah and all things
[41:51] that were due to him had been completely
[41:53] taken away from him and consumed the
[41:57] life the prosperity that he had once
[42:00] known was now laying complete ruins and
[42:04] Ashes and he himself is also an asip and
[42:08] job had been reduced to uses but his
[42:11] life had become a sweet sailing sweet
[42:14] smelling saber unto God it's no
[42:17] different from us what what job had been
[42:21] through Hallelujah in one way or another
[42:24] we can experience it in our lives yes
[42:27] God allowed job to be Smitten by Satan
[42:30] even though job was a righteous man so
[42:33] that is sometimes the mystery why God
[42:35] allowed suffering to each and every one
[42:38] of us God also allowed Christ to be
[42:41] smitten at Calvary even though he was a
[42:44] righteous man and God in this hour will
[42:48] also allow the bride to be smitten even
[42:50] though she has been made righteous by
[42:52] the bleeding word of this hour so we've
[42:55] learned that job said the resurrection
[42:59] and job is also a type of the Bride in
[43:01] these last
[43:02] days in the Book of Job in chapter 1
[43:05] verse 8 we are all familiar about the
[43:07] life story of Job amen but we cannot run
[43:11] away from that type because job
[43:14] represent Resurrection job 1:8 and the
[43:18] Lord said unto Satan hast thou
[43:21] considered my servant that there is none
[43:24] like him in this earth yes a perfect and
[43:28] upright man one that fearth God and Es
[43:31] sketh evil an upright man and perfect in
[43:34] the sight of God hallelujah we know that
[43:38] job is the same likewise with us born in
[43:40] sin come to the word speaking lies amen
[43:43] but in the sight of God he was righteous
[43:46] he was upright in the sight of God he
[43:48] commit when we say perfection is doesn't
[43:51] mean he become absolutely
[43:53] Flawless but we see the job how he was
[43:57] so upright he served god with with with
[44:01] fervency with righteousness in his heart
[44:04] amen what God called righteous because
[44:07] job has a perfect sacrifice it doesn't
[44:10] matter how how many mistakes or our
[44:13] flows within our heart but the way that
[44:16] God looks at our sacrifice the perfect
[44:18] sacrifice so in the eye of God we become
[44:21] perfect because in the Old Testament
[44:23] when the worshiper come into the Altar
[44:25] and bring the sacrifice to the priest
[44:27] the priest is no longer looking at the
[44:29] mistakes of the worshipper but he is
[44:31] looking at the perfect sacrifice and if
[44:34] it's that perfect then say come bring
[44:36] again another sacrifice which is perfect
[44:39] without spot and without wrinkle and we
[44:41] know we have a perfect sacrifice and
[44:43] that is the Lord Jesus Christ hallah we
[44:46] have a perfect sacrifice so that's why
[44:48] in the eye of God we are already perfect
[44:51] even though you are fless but God knows
[44:53] your desire Hallelujah so perfect means
[44:58] doesn't imply absolute flawlessness
[45:00] instead it signifies that job was
[45:03] sincere in his desire to be whole and
[45:05] righteousness again because if we are in
[45:08] the Press we are struggling day by day
[45:11] we commit mistakes we have flows we
[45:13] think sometimes bad sometimes our
[45:15] decision sometimes we speak
[45:18] rude Hallelujah but God in the eye of
[45:21] God we are still
[45:25] perfect God's scription emphasize job's
[45:29] unwavering faith and commitment to
[45:32] righteousness even in the Bas of immense
[45:36] suffering right now God knows our heart
[45:40] we are struggling day by day we are
[45:42] trying to conv we have committed
[45:44] mistakes but it is a consolation that
[45:48] God said have you considered my
[45:52] bride to be perfect and upright in the
[45:54] sight of God
[45:57] God is is so proud of each and every one
[46:00] of
[46:00] us because he knows our
[46:03] desire even tonight if we come to church
[46:06] we don't come here to be to be sinen we
[46:08] come it with sincerity in our heart
[46:11] asking and looking for God to speakto us
[46:14] God knows each and every ones of us but
[46:16] God is coming here amen maybe using just
[46:19] a simple brother to speak the word and
[46:22] that word even though simple it was if
[46:24] it's meant to give it to you it will
[46:26] Quicken that word into life amen
[46:30] hallelujah have you considered this
[46:32] bright they are upright and perfect in
[46:35] the sight of God who is SK means
[46:39] Hallelujah Turning Away From Evil we
[46:40] have desired to turn away from
[46:43] Evil
[46:45] Hallelujah notice that God called job a
[46:48] perfect man he was a masterpiece in the
[46:50] sight of
[46:52] God but now God is going to allow this
[46:55] masterpiece to be Smith
[46:57] and to be misunderstood by his three
[47:00] friend and to be rejected by them as a
[47:04] secret
[47:05] Sinner and job is a type of the Bride
[47:07] this last day at the end of the seven
[47:09] Church ages hallelujah amen we are the
[47:13] Masterpiece of God but we are being
[47:16] rejected and Pritt and
[47:18] smitten
[47:20] Hallelujah and we will
[47:22] notice in the order of the books that
[47:25] preceded the book of job I we know that
[47:29] God is Sovereign and we know that the
[47:31] Bible is comprises of 66 chapter written
[47:35] by 40 different authors over the span of
[47:39] approximately 1,500
[47:45] years and second
[47:48] Peter 1:21 said that all the prophecy
[47:52] came not in Old Times by men as they
[47:54] were by old men by the of men but holy
[47:57] men of God spake as they were moved by
[48:00] the Holy
[48:02] Ghost 66 chapter 14 different auar but
[48:06] God hallelujah is the one who arranged
[48:09] each and every one of us hallelujah
[48:11] because God is not the author of
[48:13] confusion because God is the author of
[48:16] order even by the books he ordered it
[48:19] Hallelujah they are in order amen and
[48:24] Israel nayah is God's people coming back
[48:26] to Homeland after the 70 years captivity
[48:29] in Babylon which represent the seven CH
[48:32] ages so Israel and nayah they are the
[48:35] the they are the Restorations amen which
[48:38] is type of the Bride that being restored
[48:40] after the
[48:42] Captivity we have also seen a people
[48:45] called the bride of Christ in this hour
[48:47] coming back to the homeland of the word
[48:48] of the seven Church ages praise God our
[48:51] homeland is the restored word of Malachi
[48:54] 4 and revelation 10:7 amen but then look
[48:58] at the struggle that the Jews had when
[49:01] they got back to their Homeland after 70
[49:04] years of captivity and they began to
[49:08] repair the Broken
[49:10] Walls that had been broken
[49:13] down but look at the rejection and the
[49:16] persecution that they had to face when
[49:18] they began to restore those
[49:24] walls Hallelujah they are being restored
[49:27] back to their
[49:28] Homeland but they were persecuted
[49:32] rejected
[49:35] Hallelujah so we the bride of Jesus
[49:40] Christ we realize the truth of the
[49:42] message of the hour but when we it's
[49:45] time for us to to share we are being
[49:47] rejected we are being
[49:50] persecuted we are being called by
[49:52] different kinds of words and Bram and
[49:56] chist all of that but the bride know
[50:00] herself then after the book of isra and
[50:03] nemiah came the book of Easter praise
[50:06] God after the restoration the revealing
[50:09] of the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[50:12] Easter was a bride at the time when hmon
[50:15] was plotting to destroy all the
[50:18] Jews from the face of the Earth and we
[50:20] are also living in a time when all
[50:23] Nation are prophesied to plot against
[50:26] against Israel to try to destroy them
[50:29] again in this day that we are living
[50:32] in and we can see and observe what's
[50:34] happening around the
[50:36] world right it didn't happen thus by
[50:39] chance it happens according to prophecy
[50:42] and prophecy must be fulfilled and we
[50:45] thank God that we have now the pattern
[50:47] that we can see Hallelujah so that's why
[50:50] we don't fear what will be happening
[50:53] because the scripture said when all
[50:55] these things come to us look up your
[50:57] Redemption is draw it near it is a sign
[51:00] for us to give to to Rejoice don't be
[51:02] discouraged don't be fear but always
[51:05] look up amen encourage yourself
[51:08] encourage one another our time is too
[51:10] short Hallelujah there is no more time
[51:13] to look back Hallelujah if you look back
[51:16] look back what God has done for your
[51:19] life you never come to this place unless
[51:22] it was by the grace of God and when you
[51:24] look up don't be discouraged what is
[51:26] happening amen don't look up and say it
[51:29] was God himself who lead me all the way
[51:32] up to this
[51:33] time no man helped me to stand
[51:36] Hallelujah but it was God's
[51:38] grace to continue to move with each and
[51:42] every one of
[51:43] us the same history that you find in the
[51:47] book of Easter is representing itself
[51:49] again in our
[51:51] day then we see that after Easter is the
[51:54] Book of Job
[51:56] yeah Hallelujah so we look at the Bible
[51:59] now in
[52:01] different we look different when the
[52:03] seal was open we read the Bible
[52:06] different yes compared to our former
[52:09] experience with the
[52:11] denomination everything God set in order
[52:15] because the book The Bible is a book of
[52:17] Prophecy
[52:22] am Job who God called a perfect man and
[52:25] Pastor is me beaten and condemned and
[52:27] rejected by his friend as a secret
[52:32] sinner Christ was our rejected King and
[52:36] husband and when he came to Earth he was
[52:38] rejected by his own friends like job was
[52:42] and we know that he was also smitten and
[52:44] then
[52:46] resurrected so we will notice the
[52:48] pattern of events before the
[52:51] resurrection take place and we know
[52:53] there is a
[52:54] resurrection as I preach while ago that
[52:57] Resurrection is the person it's not only
[53:01] an event but it is a person and you need
[53:04] to know the person of the Resurrection
[53:06] before you will be in the event of the
[53:09] Resurrection hallelujah it's now coming
[53:11] you need to know because the the the
[53:13] time you hear it the the the word of God
[53:16] even though you are dead you will still
[53:17] be
[53:19] alive praise be to God
[53:21] hallelujah and we know that he was m and
[53:24] then resurrected notice the pattern be B
[53:27] before the resurrection take place there
[53:28] is a rejection and smiting of the
[53:31] Masterpiece have we observed
[53:36] it so many are against the message of
[53:40] the
[53:41] hour there is a rejection that's
[53:45] sming and sometimes we wonder why it
[53:49] happened sir but then we realize that
[53:52] what happened then is happening now
[53:55] there is a rejection smiting before the
[54:00] resurrection so we see in the Book of
[54:02] Job but before he job saw the
[54:05] resurrection he was first smitten and
[54:08] rejected and so we see that job is a
[54:11] type of Christ and job is also a type of
[54:13] the end time rde of this day last days
[54:15] after the seven Church ages and just
[54:17] before the resurrection of the sleeping
[54:19] Saints for the prophet of this
[54:21] generation praise God said that if we
[54:23] cannot see Christ in every chapter in
[54:26] every verse and every line then let us
[54:28] go back again and read the word of God
[54:31] hallelujah in the message 78th week of
[54:34] Daniel paragraph chapter
[54:38] 1 paragraph 101 he said now may but now
[54:42] in the in these seven Church ages that
[54:45] we have went through the Gentile
[54:49] time from the crucifixion until the end
[54:52] of the church ages now we got we've been
[54:54] through it all now now we're getting to
[54:56] a place where we can
[54:58] hit and go into the seven seal seven
[55:01] vials seven trumpets and all that is
[55:04] pictured together all dealing with the
[55:06] Jew and God's judgment to the people
[55:08] upon the earth and the remnant So
[55:11] speaking about the 7 week of Daniel he
[55:13] said that
[55:14] now we got we've been through it all
[55:17] down now we're getting to a place where
[55:19] we can hit and go into the seven seal
[55:22] and we know that the seven seal praise
[55:25] God belongs to the bride of Jesus Christ
[55:28] and the Seven trumpet belongs to the to
[55:31] the Jew and the Seven vials of those who
[55:33] reject the word of the hour so remember
[55:37] that seven trumpet and all that is
[55:39] pictured together all dealing with the
[55:41] Jews and God's judgment to the people
[55:44] upon the earth and the remnant remember
[55:47] the seven Thunders are for the
[55:50] bride amen and we all know that the
[55:53] Thunder is a message so there are seven
[55:55] Thunders there were seven voices that
[55:57] were given to the to to to the seven
[56:00] Church
[56:01] ages amen and the Seven trumpet are to
[56:04] the Jews and the Seven bals are to the
[56:07] unbeliever which is when the Judgment of
[56:09] God are being poured out on all the ones
[56:11] who have rejected the message of the
[56:13] hour in the form of the two Elijah's
[56:16] anointing of brother bham and the
[56:18] message of Moses Elijah to the 144 Jews
[56:22] remember in this great time of
[56:24] persecution there's million of Gentiles
[56:28] will die in that that rejected bride
[56:32] that remnant of the woman seed the
[56:35] sleeping virgin goes right through that
[56:38] so after the bride is rejected and
[56:40] smitten and ruptured we see that the
[56:43] remnant which is the foolish virgins
[56:45] remember that they were
[56:49] virgins the foolish and the wise virgin
[56:52] the difference is only the
[56:53] oil they have oil but not not enough to
[56:57] meet praise God the son of man because
[57:01] they are they are asking for more oil
[57:04] from the wise virgins so they have
[57:06] enough oil they don't have enough oil so
[57:09] they have only oil that they were
[57:11] Justified they were Justified they were
[57:14] Sanctified and sometime they are
[57:15] baptized with the Holy Ghost but they
[57:19] lack the oil of the person of the Holy
[57:22] Ghost
[57:23] himself that's why they are asking for
[57:25] more right but they cannot move on
[57:28] because they were designated for that
[57:29] portion of scripture only that's why
[57:32] when you are bride of Jesus Christ and
[57:33] when you recognize that you need to be
[57:35] the most praise God happiest person
[57:37] around the earth when you recognize who
[57:40] you
[57:40] are because when you recognize that the
[57:43] who you are then the rupture has but
[57:46] that Quicken your heart amen you have
[57:48] the Assurance you have the the the the
[57:51] the spiritual
[57:53] rest of all the chaos of all the word
[57:56] you can find spiritual West knowing that
[57:59] everything God is in
[58:01] order
[58:03] amen yes and the prophet said remember
[58:05] in this great time of persecution
[58:08] there's million of Gentiles will die
[58:10] that rejected bride that remnant of the
[58:12] woman SE
[58:15] amen she goes right through
[58:19] that we are already being rejected now
[58:21] by the denominations today as we can see
[58:25] the three conditions required for the
[58:27] smiting are already uniting
[58:31] together there is three power uniting
[58:34] for the purpose of smiting the bride or
[58:37] rejecting the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[58:40] there are religious power political
[58:42] power and demons power and remember that
[58:46] is how Christ was also smitten it took
[58:50] all three powers to unite together to
[58:52] Smite Jesus Christ there was Judas which
[58:56] said the demon power there was the Pires
[58:58] of usage of religious power and the
[59:01] Romans the political power three groups
[59:04] so what follow the rejected bride is the
[59:07] SMI bride amen but just before they can
[59:10] put her to death like they did with
[59:13] Jesus the resurrection and the rupture
[59:15] takes place and when and then the
[59:17] remnant of the woman see the foolish
[59:19] virgins go on to be killed during the
[59:21] tribulations period so before the smth
[59:25] and rejection the will take place and we
[59:27] can see all around they they they have a
[59:30] law sometime they close the church amen
[59:32] they accuse us of anti-government
[59:35] whatsoever but Before Time
[59:38] Hallelujah then the Rapture will
[59:41] go when the squeezing time comes amen
[59:44] and I believe it will not take how many
[59:48] years it will not take 20 years more
[59:51] Hallelujah we are really too close we
[59:54] are already over the Ephesian Church age
[59:58] amen so Ephesian Church age lasted 107
[1:00:01] years but L here we are now more than
[1:00:04] 107 years although the prophet said that
[1:00:07] this L is the shortest age among the
[1:00:09] seven Church ages but we are now over
[1:00:12] praise God 1170 more than the Ephesian
[1:00:16] Age and what are you
[1:00:20] expecting are we expecting to stay here
[1:00:22] for a little bit 100 years 50 years 20
[1:00:25] years
[1:00:26] no Hallelujah any moment in our life we
[1:00:29] need to expect every every every step
[1:00:33] that we make we need to expect something
[1:00:35] from God you plan praise God it's okay
[1:00:39] you can plan 100 years but you need to
[1:00:41] live just like he will be coming
[1:00:43] tomorrow
[1:00:46] Hallelujah if you have expectation
[1:00:49] expect that the rupture will come sir
[1:00:52] actually it will not come it will go
[1:00:55] because the rupture has already taken
[1:00:56] place in your life because said the Lord
[1:00:59] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:01:01] shout and what is the shout it was the
[1:01:03] message of the hour and you receive the
[1:01:05] message of the hour that's why you come
[1:01:07] here God you hear the shout of the voice
[1:01:09] of the seventh angel which was the voice
[1:01:12] of God speaking through him because a
[1:01:15] prophet always represent God as the
[1:01:17] prophet said I don't come here and and
[1:01:19] introduce myself but I come here to
[1:01:21] introduce Christ to each and every one
[1:01:22] of you we are not following a man but we
[1:01:25] are following Christ
[1:01:26] Christ yes sir yes sir the god in this
[1:01:29] last day which is now the revealed word
[1:01:31] of the hour oh hallelujah our time is
[1:01:34] too short my brothers too too short for
[1:01:37] us to quarrel with one another to argue
[1:01:40] with one another to be rude with one
[1:01:42] another to think about something bad
[1:01:44] about one but it's time to clean our
[1:01:46] heart clean our mind of rudiness Amen of
[1:01:50] busness or gous whatsoever we need to
[1:01:52] clean our heart my brother and sister
[1:01:55] and expect for the Rapture to come
[1:01:59] am don't expect for our euny to come
[1:02:03] better that's why I pity our young
[1:02:05] couple marriage
[1:02:07] couple Hallelujah they will struggle a
[1:02:12] lot because of the inflations and all
[1:02:15] the thing that they come through but
[1:02:17] praise be to God Amen God will make the
[1:02:22] time
[1:02:23] short or else no one will be saved yes
[1:02:27] looking for that amen young couple you
[1:02:29] need to encourage one another time is
[1:02:32] too short let us just praise God let us
[1:02:35] just worship God let us rejoice God Amen
[1:02:38] don't look yourself don't look at
[1:02:40] whatever situation you are in look at
[1:02:42] the promise of
[1:02:43] God because God will supply all your
[1:02:46] needs according to the riches of his
[1:02:48] glory and know how how how short you are
[1:02:52] maybe financially but God is able to
[1:02:55] meet your need according to the richness
[1:02:57] of his
[1:02:58] glory even Elijah said okay go and
[1:03:03] rest because Jezebel is looking for
[1:03:06] you go to the go go to the the to the
[1:03:10] brook Chariot and have
[1:03:12] rest and I will sustain you while you
[1:03:15] are
[1:03:16] [Applause]
[1:03:17] resting if we rest upon the promises of
[1:03:20] God he will sustain its needs according
[1:03:24] to the riches of his God don't struggle
[1:03:26] very
[1:03:27] much just leave it unto the
[1:03:29] Lord just like the first time when
[1:03:32] brother Ron asked me few years ago
[1:03:35] brother Mario I want you to preach in my
[1:03:37] my church and I told him brother Ron you
[1:03:40] know my English is not uh fluent and
[1:03:43] give it to some brothers who are good in
[1:03:45] English I it's it's enough for me to
[1:03:49] just sit down and listen and enjoy the
[1:03:52] word of God anyway being a Believer and
[1:03:55] a medic
[1:03:56] we we just the same
[1:04:01] reward until the time has come that I
[1:04:03] cannot
[1:04:05] refuse and I say okay
[1:04:09] amen and every time he told me brother
[1:04:12] Mario you can preach and I say brother
[1:04:15] Ron just give me at least two weeks to
[1:04:19] prepare cuz I need
[1:04:22] to translate my thought into English
[1:04:26] English so some sometimes I speak broken
[1:04:28] English but thank God we don't have
[1:04:31] discrimination here in
[1:04:32] America but in the Philippines when you
[1:04:35] have a grown grammars you will be
[1:04:37] discriminated oh you have a wrong
[1:04:38] grammar you don't but in America They
[1:04:40] Don't Really they are not particular in
[1:04:44] grammars especially the message of the
[1:04:46] hour what they are looking for is the
[1:04:49] thought of God coming from the mouth of
[1:04:51] the preacher and I believe God is the
[1:04:53] one who will give that inspiration not
[1:04:55] the preacher we are just a mouthpiece of
[1:04:58] God that's why when brother run tell me
[1:05:00] you brother may you go Don't Preach then
[1:05:03] sometimes I struggle very
[1:05:06] much two weeks in preparation but no
[1:05:11] never have a thought what to preach even
[1:05:14] though how read I study and everything
[1:05:16] doesn't come give me the inspiration it
[1:05:19] give me I become nervous and
[1:05:22] nervous and sometimes let's say
[1:05:25] Wednesday Tuesday no nothing no
[1:05:29] inspiration no
[1:05:31] nothing and sometimes I'm so
[1:05:33] nervous and I told myself maybe this
[1:05:36] will be the cause that I will have a
[1:05:39] high blood
[1:05:42] pressure maybe I will tell brother Ron
[1:05:44] brother Ron I will stop preaching
[1:05:47] because I might have a heart attack in
[1:05:48] the P I am so nervous because I
[1:05:52] struggled every time I struggled I
[1:05:55] struggled Lord Lord what will I preach
[1:05:56] Lord what will I preach then the time
[1:05:58] has come that God told me just
[1:06:01] relax don't struggle let me speak
[1:06:05] through your mouth I learn praise God to
[1:06:08] relax I learn to trust God I learn to
[1:06:11] get away from my mind and I learn to
[1:06:13] humble myself Lord if you called me to
[1:06:16] preach then put something in my heart
[1:06:18] that I can preach to the people of God I
[1:06:21] don't want people to look at me but they
[1:06:24] every time I preach may they see you in
[1:06:26] the manifestations of your word Lord not
[1:06:29] a person standing here but the word that
[1:06:31] is being revealed into your heart amen
[1:06:34] that's why I try to become relaxed and
[1:06:36] the more I relax the more God revealed
[1:06:38] himself unto us he gave more word added
[1:06:41] one word upon one word upon one word and
[1:06:43] another and I realized the prophet said
[1:06:45] that a real gift is letting yourself get
[1:06:48] out of the way the same with us my
[1:06:51] brother don't struggle of the things
[1:06:53] that we can see the inflations the high
[1:06:56] rises of the apartment of the mortgages
[1:06:59] just
[1:07:00] relax everything is under
[1:07:03] control because he said I will never
[1:07:05] leave you nor forsake you Hallelujah
[1:07:08] just trust in God don't have fear don't
[1:07:11] took anything just
[1:07:14] relax as the Lord just
[1:07:16] relax sometimes it's a hard thing just
[1:07:18] to relax but we need to practice it just
[1:07:22] relax because everything is under
[1:07:25] control and God said I will never leave
[1:07:27] you nor forsake you I will meet all your
[1:07:29] needs according to the riches of my
[1:07:30] glory and sometimes we can not receive
[1:07:33] so much blessing because sometimes let's
[1:07:36] say
[1:07:38] this we don't give
[1:07:42] tights because that is a challenge of
[1:07:45] God if you want to be
[1:07:46] blessed give your tithes unto the house
[1:07:49] of the Lord and that TI not belong to us
[1:07:52] but it belong to God God gave us Works
[1:07:56] God gave us businesses and God requires
[1:07:59] only 10 part of what he has given us to
[1:08:03] return to him and that is the secret of
[1:08:07] prosperity we are not pro we are not
[1:08:09] preaching about Prosperity but God
[1:08:11] promis it I will prosper you in help
[1:08:15] amen if you are faithful in giving your
[1:08:18] tithes and offering unto the Lord he
[1:08:21] will return it and he challenge us there
[1:08:23] is no windows of Heaven
[1:08:26] there's no door or window amen because
[1:08:29] it it will it will be
[1:08:33] overflowing and that is really uh I and
[1:08:37] you need to have a personal experience
[1:08:39] about that when we IM migrated here in
[1:08:43] America we were in California and when
[1:08:47] we were there the uh my children said
[1:08:49] why we are here Dad you know that the
[1:08:52] prophet told us that California will
[1:08:53] sink why we are here
[1:08:55] and I told him no we are just
[1:08:58] temporary amen we will not stay here
[1:09:01] forever we will have find some place so
[1:09:03] when we when we when we arrived in La so
[1:09:08] we just prayed Lord give us a church
[1:09:11] that we can come and fellowship and I
[1:09:13] search all the internet I have told it
[1:09:16] before but I just want to be an uh an
[1:09:20] inspiration to somebody
[1:09:23] else we don't seek
[1:09:26] for
[1:09:27] works but we need to seek the kingdom of
[1:09:30] God first and works will follow and
[1:09:33] during the time we don't have any money
[1:09:36] and by God's grace
[1:09:38] he he put everything in
[1:09:43] order and I met a man and uh told they
[1:09:48] have a house forent and he asking for
[1:09:53] 1,200 and I just told him we just came
[1:09:57] from the Philippines we are just new
[1:09:59] here and we don't have enough money for
[1:10:01] the down payment no

[1:10:12] okay I'll give you

[1:10:21] that's just a
[1:10:22] simple uh little bit house to bed
[1:10:25] something thing we don't see the man we
[1:10:28] don't see the house because we were at
[1:10:31] that time in California and he was here

[1:10:34] Arizona in other words we close our
[1:10:37] transaction just come no don't pay no

[1:10:43] can find job just
[1:10:47] come God or castrated everything and

[1:10:58] kingdom of God first and all these
[1:11:01] things shall be added unto you that
[1:11:03] scripture it did magnify in my heart

[1:11:10] any money my money is only good for the
[1:11:13] next two months and that's
[1:11:16] it but there was no fear in Josephine
[1:11:19] and my children we are just enjoying my
[1:11:21] children don't know what is happening
[1:11:24] you know when we arrive praise God we
[1:11:26] don't have any appliances and it was my
[1:11:29] youngest daughter birthday and we just
[1:11:31] celebrate and enjoy everything because
[1:11:33] God already given us a church that we
[1:11:35] can fellowship with yeah
[1:11:39] Hallelujah so Tuesday brother Ron came
[1:11:42] with brother Matthew and all the
[1:11:44] children and I and I said to myself this
[1:11:47] must be a good
[1:11:48] pastor he welcome us with his kids his
[1:11:51] grandchildren he must be a good pastor
[1:11:54] so we talk and Wednesday night praise
[1:11:57] God he welcoming this is from the
[1:11:59] Philippines they just knew and they will
[1:12:00] make this their uh home church and after
[1:12:05] the service brother Ron and sister
[1:12:09] Sandy uh bring the folding folding table
[1:12:13] capacity of six sister Sandy and brother
[1:12:16] Ron and they delivered it into our house
[1:12:20] and that was our
[1:12:21] first appliances
[1:12:25] we are so happy and I was so
[1:12:29] overwhelmed we don't expect
[1:12:31] that and because in the Philippines we
[1:12:34] were the one who really support all
[1:12:36] those uh brother sister come away we are
[1:12:39] the one who supported without thinking
[1:12:40] anything in return so when I experienced
[1:12:43] the first thing that brother R sister
[1:12:45] Sunday brought was the fing church I was
[1:12:48] so uh I was so amazed then the following
[1:12:52] day some of the brothers came with the
[1:12:55] sofa and the bed utensils and within one
[1:12:59] week and the house that I was renting by
[1:13:02] the way is a four-bedroom house wow for
[1:13:08] 800 and it's so amazing and I realize
[1:13:11] that truly the word of God if you stand
[1:13:14] true to that word he will fulfill it and
[1:13:17] he will magnify it into your life seek
[1:13:20] ye first the kingdom of all these things
[1:13:22] shall be added unto you that was 2007
[1:13:25] almost 17 years ago and God is still
[1:13:29] faithful we still have our ups and down
[1:13:31] but God hallelujah assured us I will be
[1:13:34] with you don't worry have peace and
[1:13:36] relax Hallelujah don't try it yourself
[1:13:39] because the more you try it by yourself
[1:13:41] the more you fail but you just commit
[1:13:44] everything unto God knowing that he will
[1:13:46] never Hallelujah leave you nor forsake
[1:13:50] you and being God he always fulfill his
[1:13:53] word and manifest his word praise
[1:13:57] God so we have been studying in The Book
[1:13:59] of Life and the two sections of the book
[1:14:01] of life and Revelation then is the
[1:14:05] revealing of names so we've been
[1:14:07] preaching it brother Ron preached it
[1:14:09] brother Steven preached it brother
[1:14:11] brother Freddy preached The Book of Life
[1:14:13] and we realize that Revelation 10 the
[1:14:15] open book actually is the name being
[1:14:18] called by the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:14:21] and I saw Revelation 10 chapter 1 and I
[1:14:24] saw a mighty Angel come down from heaven
[1:14:27] cloth with a cloud and rainbow was upon
[1:14:29] his head and his face was it were the
[1:14:30] Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and
[1:14:34] he had in his hand little book open and
[1:14:35] he has in the right foot upon the sea
[1:14:38] and his left foot upon the Earth and
[1:14:39] cried with a loud voice and when a lion
[1:14:41] wor it and when he had cried seven
[1:14:43] Thunders uttered their voices so this
[1:14:46] thunder is calling our
[1:14:48] names so that's why we we often read
[1:14:52] Revelation 10 because this is our
[1:14:56] scripture we are identified in the
[1:14:59] scripture when the seven Thunders
[1:15:01] uttered their voices it was the name
[1:15:03] being called and the name is being
[1:15:06] called by the mystery that is was being
[1:15:07] revealed into our day and you responded
[1:15:10] to the mystery of who you are in this
[1:15:12] last days that is the name God is
[1:15:14] calling us Revelation 10:1 that is our
[1:15:18] scripture in the every age there is a
[1:15:20] scripture being fulfilled and this is
[1:15:22] our scripture amen amen the name calling
[1:15:26] your name is being called praise
[1:15:32] God from the open book in this hour that
[1:15:34] is why when the word of this hour is
[1:15:36] being spoken you
[1:15:38] respond with an
[1:15:42] amen because you are hearing from your
[1:15:46] Tony the more the revelations being
[1:15:49] preached the more you can say Amen
[1:15:53] because you saw yourself in the word
[1:15:55] that is being revealed and you can say I
[1:15:58] am that I am what you're speaking about
[1:16:01] I am the one that you're preaching about
[1:16:03] I am identifying myself to that word you
[1:16:05] are hearing actually from brother you
[1:16:08] are hearing from your company that's why
[1:16:11] you can say Amen to every word that is
[1:16:12] being revealed and you cannot stop
[1:16:16] saying amen because amen is Jesus Christ
[1:16:20] the amen of God
[1:16:26] Hallelujah you respond with an amen here
[1:16:29] to your name being called like the baby
[1:16:31] iglet responded to the eagle Squam
[1:16:34] because that is your name being called
[1:16:36] from the Lamb's section of the book of
[1:16:39] life amen so Revelation 10 is the Lamb
[1:16:41] sections of the book of life being
[1:16:43] revealed and names being called forth
[1:16:47] but Revelation 20 at the great white
[1:16:50] turn judgment is the revealing of the
[1:16:52] rest of the names that that remain in
[1:16:56] the regular section of the Book of Life
[1:16:59] am Revelation 20: 11-15 and I saw great
[1:17:03] white throne and him that sat on it from
[1:17:05] whose face the earth and the heaven
[1:17:07] fleed away and there was no found no
[1:17:10] place for them and I saw dead small and
[1:17:13] great stand before God and the books
[1:17:16] were opened and another book was opened
[1:17:19] which is the book of life amen and dead
[1:17:21] were judged out of those things which
[1:17:24] were written in the books according to
[1:17:26] their
[1:17:29] works and the Sea gave of the Dead which
[1:17:32] were in it and death and Hell delivered
[1:17:34] up the dead which were in them and they
[1:17:36] were judged every man according to their
[1:17:39] works this is The Book of Life and the
[1:17:41] death and hell were cast into the lake
[1:17:42] of Pride this is the second death and
[1:17:45] whosoever was not found written in the
[1:17:47] Book of Life was cast into the Lake of
[1:17:49] Fire so Revelation 10 is the Lamb
[1:17:52] sections of the book of life being
[1:17:54] revealed
[1:17:55] names are being called amen and that is
[1:17:58] taking place right now under the
[1:18:00] sounding of this message but Revelation
[1:18:03] 20 is the revealing of all the rest of
[1:18:06] the names of the regular Book of
[1:18:10] Life and we realize that we are now in
[1:18:13] the Harvest Time that's right and
[1:18:15] harvest time is the end of the world
[1:18:17] whatever see that you are planted in the
[1:18:19] beginning praise God will become seed
[1:18:21] again at the Harvest Time at the
[1:18:23] maturity Harvest time is when all the
[1:18:26] seeds at the beginning are revealed of
[1:18:28] what their true region is and that is
[1:18:32] being revealed Now by how the people
[1:18:36] responds to the word of this hour you
[1:18:39] will know what kind of seed You Are by
[1:18:43] the way you respond to the word that was
[1:18:45] being revealed in your day this is an
[1:18:49] identification
[1:18:50] time because the word of God said
[1:18:53] Hallelujah to the Propet take your pen
[1:18:55] and
[1:18:57] write Genesis let every seed bring forth
[1:19:01] of its kind whatever seed you are praise
[1:19:04] God you will manifest in this last days
[1:19:06] because this is the Harvest Time praise
[1:19:09] be to God and if you are the seed of God
[1:19:11] you will manifest God which is the word
[1:19:13] in your life
[1:19:17] am and the fruit was in the
[1:19:20] seed so don't worry about the fruit
[1:19:24] if you are the seed of God and the light
[1:19:27] which is the spoken World light it will
[1:19:29] Quicken that
[1:19:32] seed don't struggle for the
[1:19:36] proof just lay in the presence of the
[1:19:40] sunlight and you will
[1:19:44] grow your patience will grow your
[1:19:47] breadly kindness will grow your
[1:19:49] Temperance will grow praise God your
[1:19:50] love will grow you don't manufacture it
[1:19:53] you don't struggle about it because the
[1:19:55] more you struggle for that
[1:19:59] fruit I know you will fail
[1:20:03] somewhere and sometimes it can
[1:20:06] discourage you why didn't I I make I
[1:20:09] didn't make
[1:20:10] it your patience barely caness from in
[1:20:13] your Temperance you will fail and you
[1:20:15] will go back again and you will become
[1:20:20] discouraged but in galatian Paul said
[1:20:23] the fruit of the Spirits
[1:20:26] are patience Temperance brotherly
[1:20:29] kindness love they are called fruit
[1:20:33] singular so when you have the Holy
[1:20:36] Spirit all those fruit will manifest
[1:20:39] sooner or later God will bring
[1:20:42] circumstances in your life and it will
[1:20:45] cultivate right whatever fruit that you
[1:20:48] are in that seed it will manifest
[1:20:52] circumstances will come and will
[1:20:53] manifest your faith it will manifest
[1:20:56] your patience it will manifest your
[1:20:58] Temperance in whatever situation you are
[1:21:01] in Hallelujah so you don't struggle am
[1:21:06] just recognize who you are and the fruit
[1:21:09] will manifest in itself not fruits
[1:21:12] plural but fruit singular but have three
[1:21:16] old nine
[1:21:18] manifestation amen
[1:21:21] amen so the fruit was already in the
[1:21:23] seed you just need to recognize who you
[1:21:26] are and when the seed was quickened you
[1:21:30] cannot help but bear fruit amen you
[1:21:33] don't struggle for your to bear fruit
[1:21:36] because the Sheep don't struggle to to
[1:21:39] have
[1:21:40] wool they don't manufacture wool they
[1:21:43] just eat and eat and eat and eat and it
[1:21:46] will just grow and grow and
[1:21:49] grow that's why some of us cannot
[1:21:52] understand the message of the hour when
[1:21:53] we sometimes we preach seven Thunders
[1:21:56] restoration praise God we PR we speak
[1:21:58] about predition some is
[1:22:01] just looking at the
[1:22:05] air they don't understand it what you're
[1:22:08] what we are speaking
[1:22:09] about because if you don't read the
[1:22:12] message or listen to the message you
[1:22:13] will not understand what the preachers
[1:22:17] preach we are preaching with
[1:22:20] inspiration but sometimes as if nobody
[1:22:23] knows about it because they are just
[1:22:25] depending on somebody who is preaching
[1:22:28] and sometimes they cannot cut up the
[1:22:29] thought of what we are preaching because
[1:22:32] they are not reading or listening to the
[1:22:36] word that's why John said blessed are
[1:22:40] they which read the word and hear the
[1:22:45] word so we don't H we don't have any
[1:22:47] excuse
[1:22:49] anymore if you cannot hear you can still
[1:22:52] read
[1:22:56] you have no excuse you need to read the
[1:22:58] word of God in order to understand
[1:23:00] because if you read the word I cannot
[1:23:02] finish my sentence but you don't already
[1:23:04] know what the direction of what I'm
[1:23:05] preaching because you have already read
[1:23:09] it and sometimes you read it but it
[1:23:12] takes the spirit of God the gift of God
[1:23:14] to Quicken the word that you're reading
[1:23:16] that you cannot understand and sometimes
[1:23:18] we read how many times how many times
[1:23:20] when the preacher come and preach and
[1:23:21] say oh that's wow that's wonderful I
[1:23:25] just know what's the revelation of
[1:23:30] it because you read
[1:23:33] it just like each and every one of us
[1:23:36] had a spoken word we can read just like
[1:23:38] somebody was going to school they have
[1:23:40] the textbook and they they they were
[1:23:42] assigned to read a certain chapter in
[1:23:44] their book and when you come to school
[1:23:46] we will read something like
[1:23:49] that and all the stud are reading and
[1:23:51] reading and reading sometimes they canot
[1:23:54] understand what they're reading but when
[1:23:56] the teacher
[1:23:57] stand and teach them they can say oh wow
[1:24:02] why didn't I see it why didn't I see it
[1:24:04] oh that's what it means so it takes the
[1:24:06] gift of God to Quicken the word that's
[1:24:09] why it's so important to have the
[1:24:10] fivefold ministry in the church this is
[1:24:12] not a onean Ministry this is the
[1:24:15] fivefold ministry that will bring us
[1:24:17] into the ification to the Perfection of
[1:24:19] the
[1:24:20] Saints sir sir and all this Bible
[1:24:23] Ministry day are not competitors they
[1:24:25] are
[1:24:27] companions we have the purpose to point
[1:24:30] everybody to the word of God until we
[1:24:31] come into the unity of the faith the
[1:24:35] faith that can turn this body into
[1:24:38] immortality that is the main focus of
[1:24:40] the fivefold ministry but if the
[1:24:42] fivefold ministry is preaching about
[1:24:48] himself you need to put a question mark
[1:24:50] on
[1:24:51] that because the scriptures of the
[1:24:53] fivefold Ministry it was the gift of God
[1:24:57] sent to the
[1:24:59] church that's why even though we preach
[1:25:02] we don't claim it is our preaching it's
[1:25:04] no it's not our thought that's why
[1:25:06] sometime they say oh thank you B Mar you
[1:25:08] bless me with your son no it's not my
[1:25:11] sermon it was God for you yes and the
[1:25:14] more I preach the word I become a
[1:25:17] partakers of that word and sometime that
[1:25:19] word that is being preached there is
[1:25:21] also being preaching to me
[1:25:24] I have nothing to do with that it was
[1:25:26] God himself speaking to each and every
[1:25:28] one of us we are just an instrument of
[1:25:30] the word of God that is being spoken
[1:25:33] that's why if a Minister preach in the
[1:25:35] pulpit and you see somebody always
[1:25:38] preaching about himself you need to have
[1:25:40] question mark on
[1:25:44] that that's why a real Minister cannot
[1:25:46] see any you cannot see him speaking
[1:25:49] about himself always speaking
[1:25:53] Christ the word of
[1:25:55] God Amen that's why when we come out you
[1:25:58] can say brother Mar praise the Lord
[1:25:59] praise the Lord it was God speaking to
[1:26:01] you not brother Mario I have nothing to
[1:26:03] do with that I am just a mouthpiece of
[1:26:06] God
[1:26:07] Amen and I thank you that you recognize
[1:26:09] the presence of God you are always
[1:26:11] saying amen and sometimes I question if
[1:26:15] my word is is exactly the right word to
[1:26:18] pray sometimes I wonder about that but
[1:26:21] when I see you smiling praise the Lord
[1:26:25] they cut it amen hallelujah so we are
[1:26:29] not particular about the words we are
[1:26:31] particular about the moving of the whole
[1:26:33] Spirit Among Us amen although how simple
[1:26:35] it was but if it's the spirit of God we
[1:26:37] will rejoice about
[1:26:40] it because I always say nding of our
[1:26:44] head and just smiling cannot give
[1:26:46] Justice to what God has given
[1:26:50] us as brother stepen said it was the
[1:26:53] grace of God unmeritable
[1:26:56] unmit uh favor unmerited favor we have
[1:27:00] nothing to do with it it's just all by
[1:27:02] the grace of God Amen we have one focus
[1:27:05] and one attention and that is to be with
[1:27:07] the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah so
[1:27:11] let us pray for one another pray for the
[1:27:12] ministers praise God that God will bring
[1:27:16] us closer unto
[1:27:18] himself as the as the prophet said
[1:27:20] Christ The Mystery of God will and
[1:27:22] someday when you recognize who you are
[1:27:24] then the Rapture will go it will not
[1:27:27] come it is already here but it will
[1:27:31] go when you don't have any doubts
[1:27:33] anymore you don't have any unbelief
[1:27:36] anymore Hallelujah you just walk
[1:27:38] according as Enoch is walking as the
[1:27:40] light was being revealed he's just
[1:27:42] walking amen he don't question he just
[1:27:44] walk until he was found not and I
[1:27:48] believe we are the same let us just walk
[1:27:51] Hallelujah live of the word amen they
[1:27:54] have chaos they have this fear trembling
[1:27:57] we just walk in the light of the message
[1:27:58] of the hour and someday praise God we
[1:28:00] will
[1:28:02] just was
[1:28:05] not he was not but he had a testimony
[1:28:08] before his translation that he pleased
[1:28:11] God you can only please God by accepting
[1:28:14] the revealed word in the hour no doubt
[1:28:17] no question no mislocation of the word
[1:28:19] no misinterpreting of the word praise
[1:28:21] God hallelujah just believe the word of
[1:28:23] God
[1:28:25] in lysia church
[1:28:28] age this laia age end in a black out of
[1:28:32] the
[1:28:33] word thereby causing a departure of the
[1:28:36] Lord from the midst he stand outside
[1:28:39] calling to his own who follow him by
[1:28:42] obedience to the word after a short and
[1:28:45] Powerful demonstration of the spirit
[1:28:47] these little hunted and persecuted group
[1:28:50] will go to be with Jesus Hallelujah we
[1:28:54] are hunted and persecuted in the message
[1:28:57] of the Masterpiece brother bam tell us
[1:28:59] that the Masterpiece must first be
[1:29:02] SM before it can
[1:29:06] speak Joseph was rejected and Smitten by
[1:29:10] his Brethren before he ascended to the
[1:29:12] power that when he spoke the whole
[1:29:15] Kingdom of Egypt obeyed
[1:29:18] him God allowed the three Hebrew
[1:29:21] children sadrach mesak and Abednego to
[1:29:23] be Smitt by being thrown into the fa
[1:29:26] furnace before the forthman appear with
[1:29:31] them so before job could come to the
[1:29:34] resurrection we see that he first had to
[1:29:36] be smitten he had to be rejected by his
[1:29:39] Brethren like Joseph and Christ
[1:29:42] was so we see the same pattern runs
[1:29:45] throughout the Bible once you see the
[1:29:47] pattern in the Bible and you realize
[1:29:48] that God is the same yesterday today and
[1:29:51] forever you'll come to realize that God
[1:29:53] never changed changes his way of doing
[1:29:55] things pattern in the word never changes
[1:29:58] once you see a pattern establish it
[1:30:00] never changes that's why we have can
[1:30:03] have confidence in the word of God Amen
[1:30:07] we can look at the Old Testament of what
[1:30:08] God is doing in there still doing the
[1:30:10] same that's why we can confidence that
[1:30:13] God is already with us Amen in the
[1:30:16] message uh the rising of the sun when he
[1:30:19] preached in April of
[1:30:22] 1965 the word must become stronger as
[1:30:26] the sun continue to rise it is the
[1:30:28] rising of the Sun so it is as brother
[1:30:31] Ron always said that the the prophet
[1:30:35] don't just preach in a a just a sermon
[1:30:39] and give a title but it was a always a
[1:30:44] declaration so the word must become
[1:30:46] stronger as the sun continue to rise and
[1:30:49] the day continues on because you cannot
[1:30:51] ripen the whe with the strength of a
[1:30:54] early
[1:30:55] sun the sun must keep rising in height
[1:30:58] and strength and keep getting stronger
[1:31:01] and hotter amen as the prophets we need
[1:31:03] to lay in the presence of the
[1:31:06] Sun in order to take away the greenness
[1:31:09] away from us
[1:31:11] amen we need to be in the in in the
[1:31:16] presence of the Sun that is why any
[1:31:19] ministers in the
[1:31:21] message that are preaching the message
[1:31:23] at the level of strength of the sun
[1:31:26] began Rising back in 1965 will not be
[1:31:29] able to bring their people out of
[1:31:34] greenness if that minister is just
[1:31:36] preaching about the prophet visited in
[1:31:39] this generation about his life story
[1:31:42] about the story in his life the Miracles
[1:31:45] in his life you can never get the
[1:31:48] greatness away from that from the people
[1:31:52] but we need to go in the Str of the sun
[1:31:55] to take away the greenness out of the
[1:31:58] people am we cannot remain just
[1:32:00] believing there was a prophet in the
[1:32:02] land which is that's good but we need to
[1:32:04] recognize the message of the Prophet
[1:32:06] that was given in our day because he
[1:32:09] said when the seal was open I must
[1:32:11] decrease and he must increase and the
[1:32:13] word of God must increase in our life to
[1:32:15] take away the greenest out of us well we
[1:32:18] it cannot satisfy that just knowing
[1:32:20] there was a prophet in the land although
[1:32:22] we believe it but the message didn't
[1:32:24] stop at just believing the prophet is in
[1:32:27] the
[1:32:30] land cu the prophet said God will do
[1:32:33] thing do things Malachi 4 turn the heart
[1:32:36] of the children back to the father
[1:32:37] Revelation 10:7 praise God the revealing
[1:32:39] the son it will be this two Ministry
[1:32:42] that will literally turn the heart of
[1:32:44] the children back to the original Faith
[1:32:46] to have rapturing faith in these last
[1:32:50] days the message the Masterpiece now the
[1:32:53] bride if the bride in the beginning was
[1:32:55] the word or the bridegroom and then if
[1:32:58] the bride is taken from the bridegroom
[1:33:00] it must be the word
[1:33:04] also what a
[1:33:06] statement so if you claim to be the
[1:33:09] bride and you need to claim it if you
[1:33:13] recognize the message of the hour then
[1:33:15] if the bride is taken from the
[1:33:16] bridegroom it must be the word also
[1:33:19] notice the bride must be why must the
[1:33:23] bridegroom be the word manifested made
[1:33:26] plain is because the bride and the
[1:33:28] bridegroom are
[1:33:30] one she is just smitten piece off of him
[1:33:35] there is the Masterpiece it was smitten
[1:33:37] and Michel Angelo could not reproduce
[1:33:40] that again he could not put it back but
[1:33:43] God is going to do it he's going to
[1:33:46] bring this little bride that's smitten
[1:33:49] right back to the side of the original
[1:33:51] word and there he is there is the
[1:33:53] Masterpiece the family back again in the
[1:33:56] garden of be so our restoration is not
[1:34:00] only on the day of Pentecost but our
[1:34:02] restoration is back to the Garden of
[1:34:04] Eden again we are Beyond Pentecost my
[1:34:08] brother and sister this message will
[1:34:10] bring us back into the
[1:34:13] original Hallelujah back in the Eden am
[1:34:17] praise be to
[1:34:19] God and the B said oh Church of the
[1:34:22] Living God bow your hearts and
[1:34:24] yourselves before God these things are

[1:35:20] but the stock must be burned and the
[1:35:23] rest of it the hus and all must be
[1:35:25] destroyed and it will
[1:35:27] be don't trust in your D denomination

[1:35:45] tonight Hallelujah I trust that it will
[1:35:48] encourage you sometimes you wonder why

[1:36:12] redemption job's life was M he was

[1:36:47] the end of your trial and the end of
[1:36:49] your testing because the Masterpiece is
[1:36:52] already being restored again Amen in the
[1:36:54] last days
[1:36:56] hallelujah Joseph life was smitten Jesus
[1:36:59] life was smitten why because they were
[1:37:02] all God's
[1:37:05] Masterpiece and so the Bride of this
[1:37:07] hour must also be
[1:37:08] smitten that is the entire
[1:37:11] picture of the
[1:37:13] Bible we were
