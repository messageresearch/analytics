[23:24] before it was very short notice I
[23:26] actually uh it was a couple hours ago
[23:28] the Lord put him apart
[23:34] and I wanted to read this verse because
[23:36] I felt it was um
[23:38] pertinent to the song it's Matthew 21
[23:42] verse 44. it's where Jesus is talking
[23:46] about the stone the builders rejected
[23:47] and he goes on down to verse 44 he says
[23:52] excuse me
[23:59] and whosoever shall fall on this Stone
[24:02] shall be broken
[24:06] but on whomsoever it shall fall
[24:10] it will grind him to powder
[24:14] you know I was uh This song is called
[24:17] Beautifully Broken
[24:19] I thought of
[24:21] The Book of Job
[24:22] and everything you went through
[24:25] whether he was touched in body he lost
[24:27] his family he lost everything he had
[24:29] even his wife told him you should just
[24:32] curse God and die
[24:34] he lost everything the confidence of his
[24:37] family that was still alive the even his
[24:39] friends doubted him and said you must
[24:41] have
[24:42] sinned or something
[24:45] but in all of that God was trying to
[24:48] take something outside from him
[24:51] but he had to break him in order to do
[24:54] it
[24:56] this song has been on my heart for like
[24:58] a year and a half and it just never felt
[25:00] right to sing it and it just this
[25:01] evening it just felt right so I just
[25:04] pray it's a blessing to y'all

[36:37] and that's the worst thing you could do
[36:39] when you see what they do
[36:42] it put me into shock
[36:45] depression
[36:48] pits of despair
[36:50] anyway
[36:52] God is good
[36:54] doctor's doctor they cut they do what
[36:57] they do but God Is A Healer
[36:59] and so people are asking me brother Ron
[37:01] how do you do you feel good I said not
[37:03] good but better
[37:05] I'll be better the Lord willing by
[37:07] Sunday I I want to be preaching to you
[37:10] on Sunday got something really deep on
[37:12] my heart
[37:13] but I want to say we are finishing up
[37:15] right now we are in the last two phases
[37:18] of the remodel of our church
[37:20] one is going to be the lighting we have
[37:23] the lighting here above us and it's
[37:26] ancient
[37:27] it's the old type lighting and they're
[37:30] going to be redoing that
[37:33] and all of these speakers that you see
[37:35] here 22 years old the sound system it's
[37:38] ancient
[37:39] and so we're going to redo the lighting
[37:42] we're going to take down all of these
[37:44] speakers that you see here
[37:46] and we'll redo the ones here on the
[37:49] platform and so that's in the next
[37:52] couple weeks
[37:53] remember when we remodeled the church we
[37:56] took the carpeting that was off the wall
[37:58] right that's a sound proofing that helps
[38:00] deaden it that's the reason that our
[38:02] brother and in the back have been having
[38:04] hard to
[38:07] trying to get it
[38:09] to sound right
[38:12] sound panels gonna be all the way around
[38:15] we're going to be doing those things put
[38:18] the sound panels up put a new sound
[38:20] system a new lighting system uh
[38:24] uh
[38:25] so just bear with us for the next couple
[38:28] two three weeks
[38:29] as we go to get this done

[44:24] more than just words
[44:26] but Lord we're here this evening because
[44:29] we have given ourselves to you father
[44:32] not only have we received you as our
[44:35] savior but Lord as Lord of our lives and
[44:40] so we're inviting you this evening that
[44:41] you would come by the foolishness of
[44:44] preaching and that you would touch our
[44:45] hearts and
[44:47] Lord touch Our Lives
[44:49] father God that we may know how to serve
[44:52] you
[44:53] Lord that when we leave this place
[44:55] father questions would be answered
[44:58] Hearts would be uplifted father God
[45:01] whatever it is the needs that's upon our
[45:03] hearts that those needs would be met we
[45:07] love you we thank you for this
[45:08] opportunity to be together we ask that
[45:11] your presence would be with us now in
[45:15] the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[45:18] and amen amen praise the Lord God bless
[45:21] you this evening it's certainly good to
[45:23] be in the house of the Lord once again
[45:25] and if you have your Bibles turn with me
[45:28] to the second book of Corinthians and
[45:31] we'll read
[45:32] chapter 3 and verse 18.
[45:37] praise the Lord thank you musicians
[45:46] Hallelujah
[45:52] second Corinthians chapter 3
[45:56] and verse 18 and it says but we all with
[45:59] open face beholding as in a glass the
[46:02] glory of the Lord are changed into the
[46:06] same image from glory to glory even as
[46:10] by the spirit of the Lord notice that it
[46:13] says we are changed into the same image
[46:17] in other words we are not going to
[46:20] be in this image of the Earthly forever
[46:24] but we will take on a new image
[46:27] amen First Corinthians chapter 15.
[46:32] just a few pages back there
[46:36] verse 41 through 49.
[46:45] and it says there is one glory of the
[46:48] son and another glory of the Moon and
[46:51] another glory of the stars for one star
[46:54] different from another star in glory so
[46:58] also is the resurrection of the dead it
[47:01] is sown in corruption it is raised in
[47:04] incorruption it is sown in dishonor it
[47:07] is raised in glory it is sown in
[47:09] weakness it is raised in power it is
[47:13] sown in a natural body it is raised a
[47:16] spiritual body there is a natural body
[47:19] and there is a spiritual body and so it
[47:23] is written the first man Adam was made a
[47:25] living Soul the last Adam was made a
[47:28] quickening spirit how be it that was not
[47:31] first which is spiritual but that which
[47:34] is natural and afterward that which is
[47:36] spiritual the first man is of the earth
[47:39] earthy somebody say that's me
[47:44] sure it is
[47:46] the second man is the Lord From Heaven
[47:50] as is the earthy such are they also that
[47:54] are earthy
[47:57] for those who were earthy guess what you
[48:00] are going to be earthy it's natural
[48:05] and as is the Heavenly such are they
[48:09] also that are heavenly
[48:12] and as we have borne the image of the
[48:15] earthy we shall also bear the image of
[48:20] the Heavenly amen may the Lord add the
[48:23] blessing to the reading of his word you
[48:25] may be seated this evening
[48:29] I would like to
[48:30] perhaps just finish up this little
[48:33] series that we've been speaking off on
[48:36] God's School of humility and this is
[48:38] part five and I would like to take for
[48:42] the subject it's all about image
[48:47] it's all about image and brother Austin
[48:51] as we Minister here this evening you'll
[48:54] realize why the Lord put this song upon
[48:58] your heart
[48:59] because it goes right along with the
[49:01] service
[49:02] so now when we first began on this
[49:05] little series God's School of humility
[49:08] we began looking at the Statue of
[49:11] Nebuchadnezzar's dream and how this
[49:14] statue it was uh
[49:16] it was a symbol and it was a
[49:19] representation of not only the Gentile
[49:22] Nations that would be but it was also a
[49:26] representation of our humanity and of
[49:30] who we are as human beings as
[49:33] individuals and so we see that in that
[49:37] dream that God loves our Humanity so
[49:40] much
[49:42] that he takes that image of humanity and
[49:45] he strikes it with a rock
[49:48] that's exactly how much God loves our
[49:51] Humanity not only does he strike it with
[49:54] a rock but and not only does he smash it
[49:57] into these little pieces but the Bible
[50:00] says that it was smashed so small that
[50:03] it was like the chaff on the threshing
[50:06] floor and that when the wind blew it
[50:08] blew it wherever it would understand
[50:11] that this is how much God thinks of us
[50:14] in our Humanity this is how much he
[50:18] thinks of us in our earthy bodies this
[50:21] is how much he thinks of us in this
[50:23] bodily image that we take so much pride
[50:27] in
[50:29] he hates it
[50:32] so we realize that uh what happens is
[50:37] that each and every time that we come to
[50:39] church that this rocket it is it is the
[50:43] it is Christ the word and when we come
[50:46] to church what is that rock doing it is
[50:49] smiting this image of humanity and so
[50:53] understand that when God does something
[50:56] he always does it for a purpose and when
[50:59] when God crushes something he just
[51:02] doesn't leave it in a crushed State when
[51:05] something is broken he just doesn't
[51:07] leave it broken but God is a restorer of
[51:11] those things that were crushed he is a
[51:13] restorer of those things which are
[51:16] broken so what God does is he takes our
[51:19] Humanity he crushes it he tears it apart
[51:22] so that he can rebuild it again into the
[51:25] image of a statue of a perfect man
[51:27] because the first image is earthy it's
[51:30] carnal it's prideful but this second
[51:33] image is humble and in the image of God
[51:36] and that's what God wants out of us
[51:39] he doesn't want us in this earthy image
[51:42] but he wants us to be in the image that
[51:45] we were before the foundations of the
[51:47] world
[51:49] amen because that's what we're going
[51:51] back to
[51:53] praise the Lord
[51:54] so we find out that each and every time
[51:56] we come to church what's happening is
[51:58] this this Humanity that we love so much
[52:01] is being crushed lying upon line precept
[52:04] upon precept sermon after sermon song
[52:07] special after song special prayer after
[52:10] prayer however you want to put it God is
[52:12] doing away with our Earthly carnal man
[52:16] and he's replacing it with the spiritual
[52:19] image
[52:22] Hallelujah
[52:27] so we find there in verse 48 of our
[52:30] opening scripture it says as is the
[52:34] earthy such are they also that are
[52:37] earthy
[52:39] now our Humanity in which we are we are
[52:44] earthy
[52:46] you can say earthy you can say Earthly
[52:49] do you agree with me say Amen
[52:51] okay I come to realize there was there
[52:55] was something uh I learned from Brother
[52:56] Burley Williams and I used to think man
[52:59] you get a you get a minister up here and
[53:00] he's always trying to get the people to
[53:02] say amen and can you say amen and well
[53:04] yes I can say Amen but I realized what
[53:07] he was doing it was actually a very
[53:09] smart tactic because when you get
[53:11] somebody to engage and say amen back to
[53:14] you guess what it does oh yeah I can say
[53:17] amen amen it re-engages the people back
[53:21] into the sermon and what's being said it
[53:24] is so important
[53:25] not only for me as a minister to have a
[53:28] connection with you for me as a minister
[53:31] to have a connection with the Holy
[53:33] Spirit but it's important for you to
[53:36] have a connection with the Holy Spirit
[53:38] and so when you hear something that you
[53:40] can agree to when you say Amen you were
[53:43] connecting yourself to the spirit of God
[53:46] so when you're connected with God and
[53:49] I'm connected and we are both connected
[53:51] together it makes a three-fold chord the
[53:54] Bible says a three-fold court is not
[53:57] easily broken so if you do your part and
[54:01] you connect to the Holy Spirit and I do
[54:03] my part guess what's going to happen God
[54:05] is going to deal with hearts
[54:09] hmm
[54:12] so we find out that our humanity is
[54:15] earthy and that's the kind of person
[54:17] that our humanity is going to bring
[54:20] forth as an earthy or Earthly person
[54:25] an earthy person has a certain way of
[54:27] thinking an Earthly person has a certain
[54:31] way of acting they have a certain way of
[54:33] talking they have a certain way in which
[54:35] they dress why because they are Earthly
[54:38] but we are not just supposed to be in
[54:42] the image of the Earthly but our lives
[54:44] is being changed into the image of the
[54:48] Heavenly so when our lives is being
[54:50] changed by God the Holy Spirit gets
[54:53] what's happening the way we talk the way
[54:55] we act the things we say the things we
[54:58] think about how we dress how all these
[55:01] different things it's no longer Earthly
[55:03] but it's heavenly
[55:09] Earthly people mind earthy things
[55:14] and that's our issues
[55:17] is because we get so Earthly minded that
[55:21] we are of no Heavenly use
[55:24] God help us to cast down our Earthly man
[55:28] and to raise up and say father this is
[55:31] not the image that I'm supposed to be in
[55:34] now Lord let me yield myself that I
[55:37] might bring forth some kind of fruit
[55:39] that is pleasing to thee
[55:43] amen
[55:45] we get so caught up with our Earthly
[55:48] things that we forget which is most
[55:51] important in our lives and that's the
[55:54] spiritual aspect
[55:56] that's church that's having a personal
[55:59] relationship with God that's that's
[56:01] having a prayer life and all these
[56:03] different things is far more important
[56:08] in any of these Earthly possessions and
[56:10] values that we put so much high value
[56:13] upon
[56:16] Hallelujah
[56:22] in Genesis chapter 1 verse 27 it says so
[56:26] God created man in his own image
[56:31] and the image of God created he him male
[56:34] and female created he them
[56:37] so we realize that though we are born as
[56:40] natural people of the earth it is still
[56:44] God's desire as it was in the Book of
[56:47] Genesis when time first began there with
[56:50] Adam and Eve it was his desire that he
[56:52] would have a man or a son or a daughter
[56:55] that would be in his very own image or
[56:59] else he would have never created them in
[57:01] His image and so it is with us today it
[57:04] is still God's priority Hallelujah it is
[57:09] God's priority that he has sons and
[57:11] daughters that are in the earth but are
[57:15] not earthy it is his priority that he
[57:18] has sons and daughters in the Earth but
[57:21] are of the image of their heavenly
[57:24] father because when we are in the image
[57:27] of our heavenly father we do our
[57:30] Heavenly father's business
[57:35] so this is one of the reasons that we
[57:37] find out
[57:39] that God has to take us and he has to
[57:42] put us through this school of humility
[57:45] because he's trying to bring us from one
[57:49] image onto another image
[57:53] there's a purpose why God brings us
[57:55] through this school
[57:57] amen sir we would see Jesus 1962 brother
[58:00] Branham says he come to show what God
[58:03] was anything that's high and haughty
[58:06] isn't God
[58:08] God is low and humble that's what made
[58:11] him God see something that comes low not
[58:15] them that goes high so God doesn't dwell
[58:18] in hierarchies and things he dwells in
[58:22] humility and everybody said amen
[58:29] you see the Way Up Is Down look at this
[58:33] a teaching from the prophet of God
[58:35] humble yourself and you'll be exalted
[58:38] exalt yourself and you'll be humble
[58:41] that's right see God knows how to do it
[58:44] so you have to remember humble yourself
[58:47] before God don't try to think your own
[58:51] thoughts think his thoughts see
[58:55] so because we are people that are born
[58:59] in Earthly bodies and we are Earthly
[59:02] people of our first uh
[59:06] of our first nature I guess would be a
[59:09] way to put it
[59:10] everything that we've been building as
[59:13] our image as a human being God takes it
[59:17] and he destroys it
[59:20] from a very young boy guess what our
[59:22] young girl a very young person we're
[59:25] always building something within
[59:27] ourselves to bring forth some kind of
[59:30] image
[59:31] this is how I want to be this is how I
[59:34] want to comb my hair this is how I want
[59:37] to look and and on and on and on and
[59:39] throughout our life we're always
[59:40] building Upon Our image because we want
[59:43] to look good we want to be the the cold
[59:45] person we want to do this that and the
[59:47] other whatever it may be but all those
[59:49] aspirations that we have in our carnal
[59:52] nature guess what it is enmity with God
[59:56] so everything that you've been building
[59:58] this image of how you want everybody
[1:00:01] else in the world to see you God wants
[1:00:04] to take that image now and he wants to
[1:00:06] strike it with the word
[1:00:09] so what's the point in wasting our time
[1:00:12] I don't want to be building the image of
[1:00:15] this guy it doesn't matter how this guy
[1:00:18] looks in this flesh but it matters of
[1:00:20] what the character of this guy has
[1:00:30] so there's many different ways that we
[1:00:33] can
[1:00:34] preach about this thought of God's
[1:00:37] School of humility and how God uh
[1:00:42] destroys something only to build it back
[1:00:44] up again we could look at the story of
[1:00:47] the Prophet when he went to The Potter's
[1:00:49] House y'all remember that story and he
[1:00:52] went to The Potter's House and there the
[1:00:54] Potter was and there the wheel was
[1:00:55] before him and he had a piece of clay in
[1:00:57] his hand and the Bible says that that
[1:01:00] piece of clay it was marred in other
[1:01:02] words there was something wrong with it
[1:01:04] it wasn't and the image of how the
[1:01:07] Potter wanted it to look so now the
[1:01:09] Potter he takes this image he takes his
[1:01:12] clay and he starts to mold it in such a
[1:01:15] way he puts it on the turntables of this
[1:01:18] machine whatever it is called and he
[1:01:21] starts to add water to it he starts to
[1:01:23] break it up he starts to break it apart
[1:01:26] and then he begins now to put it all
[1:01:29] back together again and the image that
[1:01:32] he had in his mind before the
[1:01:36] foundations of the world
[1:01:38] and so this clade that we are a part of
[1:01:41] guess what it is marred
[1:01:45] and it is not in the right image as it
[1:01:48] should be so now God has to take us he
[1:01:51] has to break us and he has to remold us
[1:01:54] into the image of which he wants us to
[1:01:57] be in
[1:01:59] we could look at the the examples that
[1:02:01] brother Branham gave us of the beater of
[1:02:04] gold
[1:02:05] and brother Branham said they would take
[1:02:07] that gold and they would beat on it and
[1:02:09] they would beat on it and they would
[1:02:11] beat on it and they would beat on it
[1:02:13] until they could see their image in that
[1:02:15] piece of gold and so we realize that God
[1:02:18] does the exact same thing with us as
[1:02:21] Believers why does he do it because we
[1:02:24] are earthy
[1:02:25] because we are carnal and he's wanting
[1:02:29] to take that Earthly that carnality and
[1:02:32] he's wanting to beat it out of us not
[1:02:34] just for the sake of beating us but he
[1:02:37] wants to fill us now when he beats the
[1:02:39] world out of us he wants to come and
[1:02:41] dwell in US you see God always does
[1:02:44] something for a purpose
[1:02:50] we could we could look at the examples
[1:02:52] that brother Branham gives us that God
[1:02:54] is a great Sculptor
[1:02:58] and here's this this piece of ice or
[1:03:01] whatever it is and God goes to chiseling
[1:03:04] on that piece of Vice or or whatever
[1:03:07] piece of material it may be why does God
[1:03:10] do that because it's not in the right
[1:03:13] image
[1:03:14] understand it's all about image it's not
[1:03:19] about your image and how you want to
[1:03:22] look before the people but it's all
[1:03:25] about God's image dwelling and living
[1:03:27] through the believer
[1:03:31] we can look at the scriptures and how it
[1:03:33] says think it not strange concerning the
[1:03:36] fiery Trials of Life are how that God
[1:03:38] learned obedience by the things he
[1:03:41] suffered
[1:03:42] it's all for a
[1:03:47] see God is showing us through these many
[1:03:49] examples within the scripture that
[1:03:52] there's only one image that God really
[1:03:55] cares about
[1:03:56] he doesn't care about how we look and
[1:03:59] how our Earthly image is before people
[1:04:01] the only image that he cares about is
[1:04:04] his own image
[1:04:08] Hallelujah
[1:04:12] so what does God
[1:04:14] so what does God do now he brings us
[1:04:17] through this school of humility
[1:04:20] whether it's the school upon the
[1:04:22] Potter's clay
[1:04:24] whether it's the school of the the gold
[1:04:27] being beaten whether it's a the school
[1:04:30] of sickness within our body whether it's
[1:04:33] a school of of being humbled by our kids
[1:04:35] or whatever it may be guess what God has
[1:04:38] to take us through these fiery trials
[1:04:42] in order to bring us to a place
[1:04:46] Hallelujah
[1:04:48] that whenever he looks at us
[1:04:50] he sees his image
[1:04:57] oh my goodness
[1:05:00] why is he why is he doing this
[1:05:04] he's doing it because
[1:05:07] within every son and daughter of God as
[1:05:10] we all know
[1:05:11] there's a seed
[1:05:14] and God wants you as the Son and
[1:05:16] Daughter of God to bring forth of your
[1:05:20] full potential
[1:05:21] he doesn't want us as the bride of
[1:05:24] Christ to bring forth 30-fold or 60-fold
[1:05:27] but he wants us to bring forth a hundred
[1:05:30] fold in our lives and so in order to do
[1:05:34] that he has to take us through trials
[1:05:36] and testings
[1:05:38] he has to Humble us that he might use us
[1:05:41] because God dwells in humility
[1:05:45] questions and answers 1964 61. brother
[1:05:49] Brown says if he wants to do it so bad
[1:05:51] the first thing you know he finds
[1:05:53] himself a stuffed shirt like you say God
[1:05:56] you give me power to move mountains I
[1:05:59] tell you I'll do something for you if
[1:06:00] you just let me move mountains no he
[1:06:03] wouldn't he can't even get himself to
[1:06:04] the right attitude see he would never
[1:06:06] move mountains for God why because his
[1:06:09] attitude is not correct why because he
[1:06:13] is a stuffed shirt and full of pride
[1:06:16] notice this Fellowship 1960 you take a
[1:06:19] fellow that's always Lord I'll do this
[1:06:21] if if you'll do this and things like
[1:06:22] that God knows he'd be a stuffed shirt
[1:06:25] anyhow
[1:06:27] so he just takes somebody he don't want
[1:06:29] to do it and say
[1:06:30] maybe I can use him a little while till
[1:06:33] he gets to be one
[1:06:36] he noticed the problem with our humanity
[1:06:38] is that as soon as God starts to use us
[1:06:41] in a certain way we become a stuffed
[1:06:43] shirt and the moment we become a stuffed
[1:06:46] shirt guess what God can't use us
[1:06:47] anymore
[1:06:49] God keep us humble
[1:06:52] so that you might use us you see
[1:06:54] whenever we're humble before God God
[1:06:57] gets all the glory
[1:07:01] it's not look what I did for God no it's
[1:07:04] look what God did
[1:07:06] we don't do anything for God God's the
[1:07:09] one that does things for us
[1:07:13] he said so ah
[1:07:16] so that's about it you try to go get
[1:07:18] away from it all the time
[1:07:21] great ministry says always been someone
[1:07:23] trying to get away from it not who's
[1:07:26] always because let God do something for
[1:07:29] them
[1:07:30] then they get all puffed up big and how
[1:07:33] great and everything
[1:07:35] but a man that doesn't want to do it
[1:07:37] he just forced to do it
[1:07:40] and then he wants to get away from it as
[1:07:41] quick as he can get out of sight
[1:07:44] and that's usually the way that God
[1:07:46] works
[1:07:48] what's what's brother Brown I'm trying
[1:07:50] to teach us here he's trying to show us
[1:07:52] hey if there's somebody and they're full
[1:07:55] of big talk and they're going to move
[1:07:57] mountains and they're going to do this
[1:07:59] red flashing lights should be going off
[1:08:01] Sirens should be going off in our hearts
[1:08:04] er er something wrong here
[1:08:08] there's something wrong here this guy
[1:08:10] isn't in the right attitude to do
[1:08:12] something for God and if God does use
[1:08:15] them he'll become a stuffed shirt and
[1:08:16] take the glory to himself
[1:08:20] but now within the message people have
[1:08:22] been taught this so much that a lot of
[1:08:24] young people they say well uh I guess
[1:08:27] old people alike oh well uh they'll talk
[1:08:30] to you for 30 minutes about preaching
[1:08:31] and then say well I wouldn't ever want
[1:08:33] to preach
[1:08:34] because they know the right things to
[1:08:37] say at the right time
[1:08:39] so it's up to us now to have some kind
[1:08:42] of discernment
[1:08:43] and say ah I know
[1:08:46] I hear what you're saying I'm reading
[1:08:48] between the lines
[1:08:50] God help us
[1:08:55] now
[1:08:56] God will always deal with us according
[1:08:59] to our character
[1:09:02] and according to our temperaments
[1:09:05] whether we're bold and forward or
[1:09:07] whether we're making backwards
[1:09:10] understand it doesn't matter
[1:09:12] how you are in your natural person and
[1:09:15] your character if you're a son or a
[1:09:18] daughter of God God is going to deal
[1:09:21] with you
[1:09:22] amen and God will take you through the
[1:09:25] school of humility we get so caught up
[1:09:28] and we say well why Lord
[1:09:31] why me why does it always have to be me
[1:09:34] because you're a son because you're a
[1:09:37] daughter that's why
[1:09:43] amen my mom would she tells me once in a
[1:09:46] while she says
[1:09:48] she says you know son uh you'll always
[1:09:51] be our we son
[1:09:54] it doesn't matter I'm 35 years old and
[1:09:56] got a family and
[1:09:58] a bunch of kids I'm a man
[1:10:01] I'm a real man
[1:10:04] I can prove it
[1:10:06] you're always my son you always be our
[1:10:09] little boy my dad's the same way it
[1:10:12] would matter if I'm 60 years old and
[1:10:14] they're 85.
[1:10:16] you're still our little son
[1:10:20] I guess that's how everybody will always
[1:10:23] look at their kids they're always their
[1:10:25] kids
[1:10:27] I believe that that's how it is with God
[1:10:29] and with us it doesn't matter of our age
[1:10:33] or of how long we've been in the message
[1:10:35] or how long we've been serving God guess
[1:10:37] what we will always be his kids
[1:10:42] and so because we are kids he's going to
[1:10:46] deal with us as children
[1:10:52] Proverbs 3 verses 11 and 12. my son
[1:10:57] despise not the chastening of the Lord
[1:11:00] neither be weary of his correction for
[1:11:03] whom the Lord loveth he correct us even
[1:11:06] as a father this son in whom he
[1:11:09] delighteth
[1:11:11] so what is the love of God I thought the
[1:11:15] love of God was just was just a big uh
[1:11:18] fluffy love and love love oh God loves
[1:11:21] me so much no if God loves you and
[1:11:24] you're a son or a daughter guess what
[1:11:25] he's going to do he's going to rebuke
[1:11:27] you he's going to chasten you he's going
[1:11:30] to put you through trials he's going to
[1:11:32] put you through Temptations because he
[1:11:34] wants what's best for you
[1:11:37] just because we're Sons and Daughters of
[1:11:40] God it doesn't mean that nothing bad is
[1:11:42] ever going to happen
[1:11:44] because it is going to happen
[1:11:47] and it will happen but when it happens
[1:11:50] it is up to us as Believers to always
[1:11:53] remember who you are I am the Son of God
[1:11:57] and because I am a son I'm being rebuked
[1:12:00] Lord the rebuking is hard the chastening
[1:12:04] of the lord lord it hurts but thank you
[1:12:07] Father why because you're showing that
[1:12:10] you love me
[1:12:13] the moment that God begins to stop uh if
[1:12:16] God never chastens you if God never
[1:12:19] rebuked you and you say well I can just
[1:12:22] live whatever kind of life I want I
[1:12:24] don't get convicted chances are you're
[1:12:27] not his
[1:12:28] but when you slip up and you say
[1:12:31] something wrong and you do something
[1:12:33] wrong and and and your your earthy man
[1:12:36] is is elevated guess what you're quick
[1:12:39] to repent
[1:12:43] ah you know the you know what
[1:12:47] you know what happens to us you know
[1:12:48] what we do with little kids you throw
[1:12:50] fits
[1:12:51] you know what the best thing is for him
[1:12:54] good weapon
[1:12:56] and you notice real quick my goodness
[1:12:59] I should have done that an hour ago
[1:13:03] you think dude you said it worked
[1:13:08] then it doesn't break their spirit
[1:13:10] as a kid
[1:13:12] but it breaks the spirit that's driving
[1:13:16] the fit
[1:13:17] do you see the difference
[1:13:19] well I just break that young fella I get
[1:13:21] I'll break it you don't want to break no
[1:13:23] Spirit of his
[1:13:25] let them be them let them be who they
[1:13:27] are but when there's something that's
[1:13:29] acting inappropriately guess what now as
[1:13:32] parents and you guys have all done it
[1:13:34] I'm in the midst of it greatest Time Of
[1:13:37] Our Lives they say
[1:13:42] between two and five guess what
[1:13:45] it's what you're doing all day yeah
[1:13:49] ask sister Ashland
[1:13:51] she'll tell you
[1:13:53] but what does it do
[1:13:55] we don't do it because
[1:13:57] for the sake of of of doing it and out
[1:14:01] of meanness
[1:14:03] but we're wanting it to bring forth a
[1:14:05] Peaceable fruit in their lives
[1:14:08] and guess what it works and that's what
[1:14:12] God does with us you know what when we
[1:14:15] get high and elevated when we get an
[1:14:17] attitude in our lives when we get sick
[1:14:19] and tired of being sick and tired you
[1:14:21] know what we're doing we're throwing a
[1:14:22] fit you know what God has to do then he
[1:14:25] has to come along and give us a little
[1:14:26] bit of correction why because we're his
[1:14:29] kids and that's what parents do to their
[1:14:32] kids why because we love them and that's
[1:14:36] why God chastens our lives no matter
[1:14:40] what age we are because sometimes we're
[1:14:42] just adults throwing fits
[1:14:46] and God lets it go for so long
[1:14:49] and then guess what
[1:14:51] there's a correction coming
[1:15:00] lets us go so far doesn't he
[1:15:03] so we find now that the love of God is
[1:15:06] not some uh Namby pambi love no God's
[1:15:12] love is corrective
[1:15:14] listen to this the exposition of the
[1:15:16] seven Church ages we're going pretty
[1:15:19] quickly tonight we're not going to hold
[1:15:20] you for very long brother Branham says
[1:15:22] and now he says to his own as many as I
[1:15:25] love I rebuke and chasten to rebuke is
[1:15:28] to reprove to reprove is to expose with
[1:15:32] a view of Correction
[1:15:34] Jason does not mean to punish it means
[1:15:38] to discipline because his subject's
[1:15:40] amendment is in mind
[1:15:43] so why does God discipline us and
[1:15:46] understand he disciplines us according
[1:15:49] to our temperament if you're stubborn
[1:15:52] and hard-headed guess what he's going to
[1:15:54] have to deal with you a little bit
[1:15:56] harder that's just how God has made you
[1:15:59] we might as well get happy with it but
[1:16:01] if you're soft and meek and you still
[1:16:03] hey guess what you need a little uh
[1:16:06] correction God's still going to bring it
[1:16:08] but it's not going to be as hard as the
[1:16:11] other one why does he do it because he
[1:16:13] has a he has uh uh the subject's
[1:16:16] amendment in mind he has your well-being
[1:16:21] and mind that's the final goal
[1:16:23] Hallelujah
[1:16:27] so next time you ask well why why God
[1:16:30] has my best needs in mind
[1:16:34] that's why he's doing it why is he
[1:16:37] correcting me because he loves me
[1:16:43] this is exactly what we find in Hebrews
[1:16:45] 12 5-11 and you've forgotten the
[1:16:49] exhortation which speaketh unto you is
[1:16:51] unto children my son despite his not
[1:16:53] thou the chastening of the Lord nor
[1:16:55] faint when thou art rebuked of him for
[1:16:57] whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and
[1:17:00] scourges every son whom he receiveth if
[1:17:03] he endure chastening God dealeth with
[1:17:06] you as with sons
[1:17:09] for what son is he whom the father
[1:17:12] chastens not but if he be without
[1:17:14] chastisement whereof all are partakers
[1:17:16] then you are bastards and not Sons
[1:17:19] furthermore we have had fathers in our
[1:17:22] flesh which corrected us and we give
[1:17:25] them reverence
[1:17:27] shall we not much rather be in
[1:17:29] subjection onto the father of spirits
[1:17:32] and live
[1:17:33] for they verily are a few days chastened
[1:17:36] us after their own pleasure but he for
[1:17:39] our Prophet somebody say Amen
[1:17:44] that we might be partakers of his
[1:17:49] Holiness because understand our Holiness
[1:17:52] and our righteousness is as filthy rags
[1:17:57] so now the chastisement of the Lord is
[1:18:00] to bring us to a place as a son or a
[1:18:03] daughter of God that we might be
[1:18:05] partakers of his
[1:18:07] holiness
[1:18:11] now
[1:18:14] that we might be partakers of his
[1:18:16] Holiness now no chastening for the
[1:18:18] present seemeth to be joyous
[1:18:21] put his Grievous
[1:18:23] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[1:18:27] Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[1:18:29] them which are exercised thereby so what
[1:18:33] does it do it's not just because God is
[1:18:35] is some some kind of God up here any any
[1:18:38] and and God is some kind of uh child
[1:18:41] beater and he just wants to beat all his
[1:18:44] children no he's doing it for a purpose
[1:18:46] that it might bring forth fruit in our
[1:18:49] lives
[1:18:51] it says herein is now set forth the love
[1:18:54] of God he desired in love a family of
[1:18:58] his home a family of Sons Sons like
[1:19:01] himself
[1:19:03] there before him lies all mankind as one
[1:19:05] lump of clay out of that same lumpy will
[1:19:08] now choose vessels unto honor and unto
[1:19:10] dishonor the choosing will be his own
[1:19:13] choosing
[1:19:14] then those chosen ones born of the
[1:19:17] spirit will be trained to conform to His
[1:19:19] Image in their walk
[1:19:22] he reproves with all long-suffering and
[1:19:25] gentleness and mercy he chastens with
[1:19:29] nail scarred hands amen sometimes as
[1:19:32] Potter must take the vessel he was
[1:19:34] working on and thoroughly break it down
[1:19:38] in order that he may rebuild it exactly
[1:19:42] as he desires it
[1:19:46] but it is love
[1:19:49] that is his love
[1:19:52] another way of his love there is not
[1:19:56] there cannot be
[1:19:58] what a revelation that this gives to us
[1:20:02] as believers
[1:20:04] to say father through the ups and
[1:20:07] through the downs and through the good
[1:20:09] times and through the bad times through
[1:20:11] the Mountaintop experiences and the
[1:20:14] valley experiences through the fiery
[1:20:16] darts of the devil and all these things
[1:20:19] that we that we go through here and
[1:20:21] louder you see it to know that it is all
[1:20:24] for our own good purpose
[1:20:28] that God is trying to bring us out of
[1:20:31] this earthy image into an image just
[1:20:35] like how he is
[1:20:37] to know that the footsteps of the
[1:20:39] righteous are of the Lord to know that
[1:20:41] every situation that God has placed it
[1:20:44] in our lives is for a purpose guess what
[1:20:47] it takes all the worry out of it it
[1:20:49] takes all the the am I a son or am I not
[1:20:52] out of it it takes all the anxiety out
[1:20:54] of it why because we're believing the
[1:20:56] word of God and we believe and say
[1:20:59] father this is not joyous for the time
[1:21:02] but I know in my life it's going to
[1:21:04] bring forth a Peaceable fruit of
[1:21:07] holiness
[1:21:10] what a revelation
[1:21:14] it takes the why out of things
[1:21:17] it takes the why out of it and you say
[1:21:19] well I don't want to say why no more but
[1:21:22] I want to say father I don't understand
[1:21:26] but
[1:21:28] thank you
[1:21:29] thank you that I'm a son thank you that
[1:21:32] you show me your love through rebuking
[1:21:35] and chastening
[1:21:38] Hallelujah
[1:21:43] God loves us
[1:21:45] so much
[1:21:48] that he wants us
[1:21:50] to be a part
[1:21:51] of his Heavenly image
[1:21:55] he loves you so much that he doesn't
[1:21:57] want you to stay in a carnal state
[1:22:02] and so now he brings us
[1:22:05] through this school of humility
[1:22:08] every school is different in curriculums
[1:22:11] are different so every trial is
[1:22:13] different every upset is different
[1:22:15] everything that happens guess what it is
[1:22:17] all different everybody's school is
[1:22:19] different but God is bringing us through
[1:22:21] this school that we might learn to be
[1:22:24] obedient children
[1:22:29] God wants us to come to a place
[1:22:32] of full maturity
[1:22:36] he doesn't want to deal with babies
[1:22:38] anymore
[1:22:39] that was when that was that was when the
[1:22:42] when the uh when the church ages began
[1:22:46] guess what uh there's the Corinthian
[1:22:48] Church and everything they were they
[1:22:49] were little babies
[1:22:51] we're further down the road now we've
[1:22:54] grown now there's more of the word now
[1:22:56] the word has been unfolded and it's open
[1:22:58] to us in its entirety in its maturity
[1:23:01] and guess what he's wanting us to do
[1:23:03] he's wanting us to take part of this
[1:23:05] open book to become mature Sons and
[1:23:09] Daughters of God
[1:23:11] because with a change of maturity comes
[1:23:15] a change of thinking
[1:23:19] Hallelujah
[1:23:20] so this is very interesting the other
[1:23:22] week and I believe even us as as
[1:23:25] ministers and and even uh to everybody I
[1:23:30] suppose God will put uh have some little
[1:23:33] things in our lives happen for us to see
[1:23:35] the spiritual aspect of it
[1:23:38] and so like I said you know like many
[1:23:41] young families we're in the process of
[1:23:44] of child training and and everything and
[1:23:47] it's a lot of fun
[1:23:49] and so we found there the other week
[1:23:51] that little Henry comes up to Ashland
[1:23:54] and he goes mama
[1:23:58] you spank us because you love us right
[1:24:02] and he goes it's my Ashland goes yes yes
[1:24:09] it is that makes no sense
[1:24:12] [Laughter]
[1:24:18] and it was so funny she had him she
[1:24:20] recorded it and had him say it again
[1:24:24] here he is his little three-year-old
[1:24:27] mind is trying to grasp this this
[1:24:31] philosophy of of getting whipped and
[1:24:36] Punishment as a form of love
[1:24:39] and he's trying to grasp but then and in
[1:24:41] his little mind he he he he can't
[1:24:44] understand it why is it that he that he
[1:24:47] couldn't understand it is because he's a
[1:24:49] babe
[1:24:51] he's a babe in the family he's just a
[1:24:53] little child and when you're just a
[1:24:55] little child you don't understand the
[1:24:58] love of your parents and how they
[1:25:00] portray it to you through child training
[1:25:02] so it is with the believer
[1:25:05] as long as we are uh we have a
[1:25:08] three-year-old mindset towards God and
[1:25:10] we're and we're little babes in Christ
[1:25:12] and we're thinking to God and we're
[1:25:14] saying I I I don't understand lord I
[1:25:17] can't grasp how you love me when it
[1:25:20] seems like if it's not one thing it's
[1:25:23] another in my life and if you really
[1:25:25] loved me I I wouldn't have this issue if
[1:25:28] you wouldn't love if you didn't if you
[1:25:29] loved me I I wouldn't have done that and
[1:25:31] I wouldn't have fallen on this and that
[1:25:33] and on and on and on and on and on
[1:25:36] why are you thinking of the love of God
[1:25:39] like that for is because you are acting
[1:25:43] as a babe
[1:25:45] you're acting childish
[1:25:48] you're acting like a little baby with no
[1:25:50] teeth
[1:25:51] who can't Feast upon the meat of the
[1:25:54] word
[1:25:57] but it's very interesting
[1:25:59] whenever you look at the life of Paul
[1:26:04] because in second Corinthians 12 verse 7
[1:26:08] through 10 it says
[1:26:10] now notice the attitude of Paul here
[1:26:15] Paul understands
[1:26:18] why he has what he has in his life
[1:26:22] and why is it that Paul understands this
[1:26:26] Thorn that's within his flesh it's
[1:26:29] because he's not a babe in Christ
[1:26:31] it's because he is a mature Christian
[1:26:34] and he understands the plan and the love
[1:26:37] of God
[1:26:40] Paul says unless they should be exalted
[1:26:43] above measure through the abundance of
[1:26:46] Revelations
[1:26:48] he knew he had an abundance of
[1:26:50] Revelations the Apostle Peter Peter says
[1:26:54] uh Paul says things that are hard to be
[1:26:57] understood
[1:26:59] I'm sure when Paul wrote a letter a
[1:27:02] personal letter to Peter or whoever it
[1:27:04] may have been Peter had a question uh I
[1:27:08] don't quite understand what you're
[1:27:10] saying you're hard to understand
[1:27:12] stop speaking on those things keep it
[1:27:14] simple for me
[1:27:17] he knew
[1:27:19] because of the abundance of these
[1:27:22] Revelations
[1:27:23] there was given to me a thorn in the
[1:27:25] flesh
[1:27:26] the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest
[1:27:29] I should be exalted above measure
[1:27:33] Paul knew him his own self
[1:27:37] he said ah I'm I'm uh I'm I'm a Pharisee
[1:27:42] of Pharisees and I was I was this and I
[1:27:45] was that and and I tell you what I
[1:27:47] persecuted the church and I did all
[1:27:49] these things Paul was a prideful man
[1:27:53] but he knew that he had to keep it
[1:27:55] grounded and he knew that God had to
[1:27:58] keep him grounded therefore he said this
[1:28:01] Thorn In My Flesh I know why it was
[1:28:03] given me because I'm a prideful person
[1:28:05] and God can't use me with pride in my
[1:28:07] life so I got to stay humble
[1:28:11] have you ever just tried to stay humble
[1:28:15] that's impossible
[1:28:18] so God now has to take us
[1:28:22] and make us humble
[1:28:24] why because he loves us
[1:28:28] for this thing I've been sought verse 8
[1:28:30] I besought the Lord Thrice that it might
[1:28:33] depart from me
[1:28:35] and he said unto me my grace is
[1:28:37] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[1:28:40] made perfect in weakness now notice most
[1:28:44] gladly therefore will I rather glory in
[1:28:48] my infirmities that the power of Christ
[1:28:51] May rest upon me therefore I take
[1:28:54] pleasure in infirmities and reproaches
[1:28:57] and Necessities in other words and the
[1:29:00] things that I have need of I'm going to
[1:29:03] glory in those things and persecutions
[1:29:06] I'm going to glory in these things in
[1:29:10] distresses for Christ's sake for when I
[1:29:13] am weak then am I strong
[1:29:19] Paul did not have the mentality
[1:29:24] of a babe in Christ
[1:29:27] but Paul came to a place of maturity
[1:29:31] where he realized the issues that he had
[1:29:35] in his own life was nothing other than
[1:29:39] the hand of God upon his life
[1:29:44] he wasn't out here saying well that
[1:29:47] makes no sense
[1:29:49] that makes no sense I'm I'm a first
[1:29:51] church age messenger and here I am an
[1:29:54] imprisoned here I am I only have one
[1:29:57] cloak here I am everybody has forsaken
[1:30:00] me uh uh why how can this be why Lord no
[1:30:05] he didn't have no little three-year-old
[1:30:07] mentality but his mentality was these
[1:30:10] things my needs my distresses my
[1:30:13] persecutions all these things that I
[1:30:15] have an issue with guess what they were
[1:30:18] given of God for my own benefit
[1:30:20] therefore father I will glorify in my
[1:30:25] infirmities
[1:30:26] I will glorify in my weaknesses I will
[1:30:30] glorify in my persecutions why it's the
[1:30:34] hand of God
[1:30:36] David
[1:30:39] what's God trying to do he's trying to
[1:30:42] wean us away from the sincere milk of
[1:30:45] the word and he's wanting us to walk and
[1:30:48] act as mature Christians
[1:30:52] Hallelujah
[1:30:55] as the musicians come
[1:30:57] I'll bring this to a close
[1:31:01] what is God
[1:31:04] trying to do what is he wanting to do
[1:31:07] what is his purpose
[1:31:10] in these things
[1:31:12] his purpose is very very simple
[1:31:16] that he knows we are people that are
[1:31:19] earthy
[1:31:20] he knows we were people that are carnal
[1:31:24] he knows it
[1:31:25] he knows we are people because of our
[1:31:27] first birth guess what we gravitate more
[1:31:31] to the Natural Things of this world than
[1:31:34] we do to the spiritual things of God
[1:31:39] but because we are Sons
[1:31:43] and because we are Daughters of God
[1:31:46] he's not going to leave us in this
[1:31:49] condition
[1:31:52] so now he takes the lump of clay he
[1:31:55] takes the lump of gold he takes these
[1:31:58] different things and fiery darts of the
[1:32:00] enemy and on and on and on and he makes
[1:32:03] it work together for the good
[1:32:07] for those who love God and are called
[1:32:10] according
[1:32:12] to his purpose
[1:32:16] oh and he takes us through this school
[1:32:19] and he takes us through that school and
[1:32:22] you say brother Stephen I don't like
[1:32:24] school well neither did I
[1:32:26] but here we are
[1:32:28] every day we're going through school and
[1:32:31] I hope you're learning
[1:32:33] because if we're not learning and you
[1:32:35] don't pass the test guess what's going
[1:32:37] to happen you're going to go through it
[1:32:39] again you're going to go through it
[1:32:41] again and you're going to go through it
[1:32:43] again and God is a god with great
[1:32:45] patience
[1:32:47] it doesn't matter how many times you got
[1:32:49] to retake the class
[1:32:51] he is not some prideful parent that's oh
[1:32:53] my goodness my son
[1:32:55] let's homeschool him so nobody knows
[1:32:59] they're 12 years old in first grade I
[1:33:02] don't understand how they can't pass the
[1:33:04] test no if you're 30 years old God will
[1:33:08] keep you in first grade until you pass
[1:33:09] the test if you're 40 if you're 50 if
[1:33:12] you're 60 it doesn't matter to God God
[1:33:16] will keep you in that place until you've
[1:33:18] passed the test
[1:33:20] and when you pass that test guess what
[1:33:22] he's going to take you through another
[1:33:24] class and he's going to take you through
[1:33:27] another class and before you know it
[1:33:29] you're going to start passing these
[1:33:30] classes because you realize if I don't
[1:33:32] pay attention I'm not going to pass
[1:33:38] so now God is taking us from this
[1:33:41] Earthly
[1:33:43] he's not just gonna take us and pick us
[1:33:45] up and set us over here
[1:33:48] our journey is from here to here our
[1:33:51] journey is from Earth to Heaven our
[1:33:54] journey is from Earthly beings to
[1:33:56] Spiritual Beings but guess what there's
[1:33:59] a journey in between the beginning and
[1:34:01] the ending
[1:34:03] [Music]
[1:34:05] so God's going to bring things your way
[1:34:09] he's going to bring situations your way
[1:34:11] gonna bring people your way gonna bring
[1:34:14] whatever it may be your way because he
[1:34:17] has a purpose
[1:34:20] why because your sons and daughters of
[1:34:23] God
[1:34:25] and when he gets us to that place guess
[1:34:28] what
[1:34:28] [Music]
[1:34:30] a Rapture is going to happen
[1:34:33] only thing we're going to take with us
[1:34:35] is our character
[1:34:36] he's not going to worry about this
[1:34:39] Earthly image that you've been building
[1:34:41] for all these years for Flesh and Blood
[1:34:43] shall not see nor inherit the kingdom of
[1:34:46] God
[1:34:46] [Music]
[1:34:50] so he's taken us back
[1:34:53] to what we was before
[1:34:57] it's taken us back to a place
[1:35:00] that we were before
[1:35:02] he's taken us back to a place where we
[1:35:06] will be fully adopted Sons and Daughters
[1:35:10] of God
[1:35:11] right now guess what we have the earnest
[1:35:13] of our inheritance
[1:35:16] but at the time of the Rapture brother
[1:35:18] Brown says that's when the fullness of
[1:35:21] the adoption
[1:35:22] the fullness of God the fullness of
[1:35:25] everything that we have ever dreamed of
[1:35:28] guess what happens it's going to take
[1:35:30] place
[1:35:31] and you're going to be there
[1:35:34] a table
[1:35:36] spread brother Brown said thousands of
[1:35:39] miles long
[1:35:41] God wants his children around the table
[1:35:45] brother Branham says I'll never forget
[1:35:47] it I remember watching this in my room
[1:35:50] as a sinner boy
[1:35:52] Rocco gave me this thing
[1:35:55] the DVD 20th century prophet
[1:35:59] Harry was he said
[1:36:01] oh my
[1:36:03] and there are this table will be
[1:36:05] thousands of miles long
[1:36:08] and the dream the redeemed of the Lord
[1:36:10] will be sitting on that table he's
[1:36:12] talking about the wedding supper
[1:36:14] honey says here our Lord will walk down
[1:36:17] the midst of the table
[1:36:19] and he goes it'll be no longer tears of
[1:36:22] sadness but it'll be tears of joy it'll
[1:36:26] no longer be Tears Of Heartache but
[1:36:28] it'll be tears of happiness and he says
[1:36:31] he'll take
[1:36:33] [Music]
[1:36:35] he'll take it
[1:36:36] his clothes he'll take His Garment and
[1:36:39] he'll wipe the tears from your eyes
[1:36:42] I remember presence of God came in that
[1:36:44] room
[1:36:46] said spirit of God will not always
[1:36:48] strive with man
[1:36:50] now is your opportunity it's the last
[1:36:52] time I'm calling you
[1:36:54] spirit of God will not always strive
[1:36:56] with man
[1:36:59] if you're out here acting all foolish
[1:37:01] you're out here acting like a little
[1:37:03] babe in Christ the spirit of God is not
[1:37:06] always going to strive with man
[1:37:15] so why is he doing this
[1:37:18] because he wants to have a family
[1:37:22] just like himself
[1:37:26] surrounded by sons and daughters that
[1:37:29] were made in His image that were made in
[1:37:31] his very likeness that have the same
[1:37:34] attributes as him that have the same
[1:37:36] characteristics as he has and when he
[1:37:40] walks down that table
[1:37:41] that's my son he may be surprised that
[1:37:44] you make it but God will not be
[1:37:46] surprised
[1:37:47] why because he has a plan for every seed
[1:37:55] plan
[1:37:58] that they will go if they started a they
[1:38:02] will make it to be there's nothing in
[1:38:04] the world that can stop the plan or the
[1:38:08] moving of God
[1:38:10] there's no sin that can stop it
[1:38:15] when he gets something in his mind guess
[1:38:17] what it's going to happen
[1:38:20] so now let me ask you this
[1:38:25] how have your thoughts been
[1:38:28] towards
[1:38:32] towards loudestia towards whatever it
[1:38:35] may be have you been thinking of God as
[1:38:38] a little three-year-old kid
[1:38:41] and the love of God and saying my
[1:38:44] goodness
[1:38:46] this this doesn't seem like the love of
[1:38:49] God in my life
[1:38:52] this makes absolutely no sense
[1:38:54] how can this be I don't understand and
[1:38:57] on and on and on have you been thinking
[1:39:00] like a little three-year-old
[1:39:02] or have you been thinking like a mature
[1:39:04] bride
[1:39:06] have you been thinking like a mature
[1:39:08] adult somebody who's been feasting on
[1:39:10] upon the word gnashing on it with their
[1:39:13] teeth no longer drinking the sincere
[1:39:15] milk and sin I still don't completely
[1:39:18] understand but God
[1:39:22] thank you
[1:39:24] thank you for the trial thank you for
[1:39:27] this thank you for that Lord It's
[1:39:30] Grievous it hurts yeah nobody likes it
[1:39:32] for the time being but it brings forth a
[1:39:35] fruit
[1:39:36] a Peaceable fruit
[1:39:38] in our lives have you been thinking
[1:39:42] I trust this evening
[1:39:45] that you'll think upon these things that
[1:39:47] we've said
[1:39:49] that you'll look at the scriptures
[1:39:51] that you'll look at the quotes
[1:39:53] and you'll realize who you are
[1:39:56] and why God is dealing with us with you
[1:40:01] because when we realize that guess what
[1:40:03] it brings it brings such a freedom
[1:40:06] you think wow
[1:40:09] this is so opposite to denominational
[1:40:12] love of God
[1:40:15] so opposite to my carnal understanding
[1:40:18] of the love of God
[1:40:19] be a brother Brown have taught it the
[1:40:22] word teaches it I see it in the life of
[1:40:25] Paul I I see it in the life of many
[1:40:27] others Lord
[1:40:28] I believe
[1:40:33] think upon these things
[1:40:36] and when you realize
[1:40:38] that God has got all things in control
[1:40:42] guess what oh it'll bring a joy to your
[1:40:45] life
[1:40:46] that'll bring us bring to your step
[1:40:49] it'll bring out something that you
[1:40:51] didn't even think was there
[1:40:53] at a time of seriousness in your life
[1:40:55] let's Stand Together
[1:40:57] let's pray father Lord we love you so
[1:41:02] much because you first loved us
[1:41:06] and we thank you Lord for your love we
[1:41:10] know that your love is elective Lord

[1:41:18] been elected to this this place of a
[1:41:21] mature bride father and and humility we
[1:41:25] say we are undeserving but yet we say

[1:41:37] chastisement father thank you for your

[1:42:01] your drama
