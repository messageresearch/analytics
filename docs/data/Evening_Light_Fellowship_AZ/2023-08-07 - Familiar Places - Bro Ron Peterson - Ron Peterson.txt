ended up in the hospital doctor saw that was my heart it was my aorta but where the mirror they called me the Miracle Man because I survived it all amen the doctor came in he said you know what you said you had a little membrane on your aorta that somehow it just held I said I know how it helped God reached down his finger and he held it there and he told Satan don't take his life and he didn't

brother Ron has never ceased to visit me and been there I remember I will have to say this but I had a chaplain come in and he come in real sad like oh oh you know are you okay and everything and I said how you doing and he said how are you doing I said I'm doing fine I said how are you doing and uh he said well I mean how are you with everything I said I'm fine everything's fine how are you and and I said God's been good to me he's been gracious to me and and he looked at me says man I need counseling from you I agree we did and my heart started to rejoice and my wife was with me in this little Mexican man next to me reached over the curtain he said will you pray for me I said absolutely he told me in Spanish but I knew what he meant and I prayed for him and the next morning he said will you pray for me again and I prayed for him and that's how the Lord's been amen he's been good and I showed a good testimony it was until I got home until I had a real meltdown but God's kept me

thank you for your prayers thanks everybody for all your prayers and everything you've done I greatly appreciate it now I know why laughs amen thank you very much brother Neil this is the beginning of another chapter in your life yes it is God's going to use it for his glory yes and God's going to have you to be a testimony to many people not only here but around the world and I believe that and I believe that you know this loss that you have it's temporary yes because we have another body ah and I'm looking forward to you going with me at some time in the future on missionary Outreach and I want you to give your testimony would you do that yes and I have another testimony a bit a larger one that I would like to give everybody when the time is right so just let you know it's forthcoming

Karen God bless you the different ones I know different ones have been traveling and everything's good to have you all out to the house the Lord I've got an awful lot on my plate God it was dealing with me uh and uh so I want you to just remain standing and let's turn to the Book of Job Job chapter 38. verses one through seven then we'll go to Proverbs chapter 8. amen I'm going to take something that I told you I felt in my heart the other day and I trust it's a blessing to you I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to venture out this morning okay I'm gonna venture out a little bit this morning I want to show you now you all know that job was a mighty man of God he went through many afflictions many afflictions and he lost everything that he had and yet God said have you considered my servant job amen and it came to the place where job was wondering I cursed the day that I was born why did I come forth from my mother's womb I should have never taken a breath and everything so what God did is God comes down and he gives him solace so he takes him to familiar places oh God I am here this morning I'm shaking I'm under expectation of what you're going to say to your people I pray now give us the anointing of the word o God let us go beyond what we can understand with the carnal mind but may there be a supernatural element come down Among Us and strike each and every one of our hearts I thank you and I Praise You reveal thyself o God for Christ is the mystery of God revealed come now we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen Job 38 verses 1 through 7. and the Lord answered job out of the Whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge grit up now that I loins like a man for I will demand of Thee and answer thou me where was thou when I laid the foundation of the Earth declare of thou Hast understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations that are of fastened or who laid the Cornerstone her up and when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy turn with me to Proverbs chapter 8. he told job gird up your loins I'm going to talk to you and I demand an answer Proverbs 8 verses 21 through 31. that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance and I will fill their Treasures the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old I was set up from Everlasting from the beginning or ever the Earth was when there was no depths I was brought forth when there was no fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the Hills was I brought forth while I was yet he that had not made the Earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the Dust of the world when he prepared the heavens [Music] when he prepared the heavens I was there when he said a compass upon the face of the depth when he established the clouds above when he strengthened The Fountains of the deep when he gave to the Sea his decree that the water should not pass the Commandment when he appointed the foundations of the Earth then I was by him as one brought up with him I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing it in the habitable part of the earth and my Delights werewith the sons of men may God add the blessing to his word you may be seated this morning in his presence Hallelujah I want to title my sermon this morning I want to get right into it I want to title it familiar places and I want to take a subject this morning where were you now the world is as you all know it in a identity crisis when we have some of the most intelligent people upon the face of the Earth cannot Define a woman or a man foreign they are in an identity crisis a gender crisis we have entered now into what I call a global epidemic with a disease that I want to call as what the prophet called it severe amnesia it is an identity crisis brother Branham says you do not get your identity from your mother you get it from your father the devil is the author of confusion he is the ruler of this world but it's a temporary ownership that's right now how many know where the greatest battle has ever fought it's in the mind go ahead and show the picture of the overhead there so the greatest battle that you and I have is in the mind amnesia it refers to the loss of memories including facts information and experiences it is a general term describing memory loss symptoms include memory loss confusion the inability to recognize familiar faces or places some of the causes of temporary Amnesia include concussion severe illness high fever emotional stress and some drugs there's three kinds of Amnesia and I wish to share with you I'm not a doctor and don't go into this but this fits perfectly with what the prophet said amen he said that the we are having a time of spiritual amnesia three times the first one retrograde amnesia a person can remember new information but cannot remember events before the onset of amnesia why is it you can remember this and this world in this birth but can't remember the birth that you had before the foundation of the world it's because you've got retrograde amnesia you remember this but don't remember that the next is dissociative amnesia a person may forget special events or time periods they're they can't associate with they forget specific events they cannot recognize their day in its message they can recognize what God has done in the past see what he's going to do in the future but are failing to see what he's doing on present tense dissociative Amnesia and then traumatic amnesia after a head injury or some kind of traumatic event they say that men in battle when they see such atrocities and and men being killed and blown up in the noises and all of that and most of those men that go to war were young men but they get traumatic Amnesia and they lose their identity and I want to take you back to another event the most cataclysmic most shocking event in world history when there was a fall in Eden it happened amidst a perfect setting in a place called Eden the a place that God had prepared but yet during that time in that place there was a great fall and that fall was so cataclysmic it was so shocking it was so dynamic that everyone film because of that fall the Bible says for all of sin and come short of the glory of God that's why we must be born again brother Branham said this battle did not start here on Earth it started in heaven amen Lucifer said I'm going to ascend my throne above the Throne of God it started in heaven the prophet of God said in the greatest battle ever fought it was cast down out of Heaven down to earth and it's become a human battle ever since and Prophet preached the sermon called spiritual amnesia you only preached it one time but he refers to Amnesia multitude times throughout his message amnesia's a temporary loss of identity and the only one of the only ways to regain your personal identity is to visit familiar places it jogs your memory all of a sudden something is said something comes to your mind and all of a sudden there's a flash and you are in Heavenly places in Christ you are jettisoned for a millisecond into the very mind of God and you catch something and all of a sudden you're energized oh God I wish I could just stay in that presence Amnesia is the loss of identity so the way for God to bring it back to you is to have you come to familiar places and I want to say and don't think I'm crazy but there has been multitudes of times in my life that I'm in a situation I'm in a place I'm in a setting and I say I was here before it's not deja vu how many of you can say I've had Supernatural experiences I was here before the reason that you believe all of the Bible stories is because you were there not physically but in germ form in seed form and I'm going to substantiate that for you you were a word attribute of God [Music] so when you hear these Bible stories they become not just stories but familiar places I believe that why you were there brother Branham said in future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride that's the same thing he does when he gives you the Holy Ghost baptism with fire he can come and dwell with you and we can sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus because we are already in him not we will be we are now sitting in Christ Jesus how do we get into it by one Holy Ghost baptism by one Spirit we're all baptized into Christ which we are now won't be in Christ we are he is a great spiritual King over the spirit that's in US because we were in him at the beginning [Music] so what God was trying to do with job he gotten so discouraged the trials of Life had gotten so heavy that he was even burdened so much that it was almost suicidal so God had to jog his memory and take him back to familiar places job I want to talk to you where were you when I laid the foundation where were you when I laid the Seas and I did this and I did that where were you job and all of a sudden I demand of you an answer because job was there and all of a sudden he was jettisoned back I was there I go back to in the beginning I go back before the beginning I go back into the very mind of God and I go back to beyond my conception of my natural birth with my mother who conceived me I go back from that birth into another birth the prophet of God calls it a word birth Hallelujah I want you to understand that when a word gives a birth it can only bring forth another word yes when the word of God hallelujah [Applause] creates in its power and it brings forth another one it will be a God one it can be nothing else nothing short of it God cloning himself amen the reason Abraham was seeking for a city whose Builder and maker was God because he'd been there before so when he told him to go seek this place you see God in his mind in Abraham's mind he could see it and so he sojourned among people looking for it because it was familiar to him don't think I'm crazy this morning and may I say this what I am seeing within the message right now me personally is so exciting I can't hardly contain it [Music] the message is becoming clearer and clearer when I listen to a tape I hear a voice within the voice I see something greater than I've ever seen before I want to say It's Supernatural I every time I read a message book it jettisons me back to places it's a deep calling to the Deep because there's a deep inside of me to respond back what is it familiar places brother Brenham said in the God of this evil age in the beginning before there was a beginning he was gone and did you know you were in him then if you are a Christian now you was in him then and then if that be so the whole godhead bodily shaved up in the person of Jesus Christ and when Jesus died at the cross I died with him for I was in him then oh God help me he was the fullness of the word manifested knowing that we would be manifested later and we was at Calvary with him we went in the grave with him and we raised with him at his resurrection and now we're ascended by his spirit I tell you there's a church rising up I say I'm rising I'm continually Rising and now we're ascending by a spirit to the throne of grace sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the Bible is filled with familiar places and familiar events the reason you believe the story about Noah you was there don't think I'm crazy Christ The Mystery of God revealed in his own word if you are a son of God and if I am a Son of God or a daughter of God we were in God at the beginning and when Jesus became the fullness of the word then we were in him germ form when he was crucified we was crucified in his body when he arose from the dead we rose with him and now since we have recognized it now we sit together in Heavenly places in him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now if we are Sons and Daughters of God we are God's children then we are his attributes of God then we got eternal life and God is the only eternal life there is then we were in him from the beginning and when Jesus became all that word then we were a part of him then amen there you are when that's in there there is no devil no powers no nothing can ever move it that is the type post of the Soul [Music] the Bible says let this mind it was in Christ be also be in you they thought it not robbery to be equal with God Revelation is making you realize something that you knew before I knew that the first time I heard serpent seed I started laughing I said I knew that what no apple that's right that's right can you understand what I'm saying when the prophet begins to reveal Christ the word and because you're an attribute of the word when you hear it it's a familiar place when you say he's not three Gods he's one all of a sudden you say I know that I knew it before familiar places foreign I've been there Revelation is the removal of amnesia Revelation is having the eyes of your understanding being open we walk by faith and not by sight I want to say this morning that I am walking in familiar places in Christ Jesus the prophet's message resonates within my soul and I say I've been there before when he speaks about the Days of Elijah and a Mount Carmel Showdown and when he so elaborates and becomes so descriptive I don't know about you but I enter into the vision with him he says there comes that old bald-headed Elijah the sun glistening off the top of his head and he looks down into the valley in his eyes narrow and he says and there his feet Dusty from the trail that he's on and he looks down into the valley and he sees the sin I tell you my brother my sister there are times when this Prophet becomes so descriptive you know why he can be so descriptive because he was there he goes back into the very mind of God transports back into time and all of a sudden here he is Mount Carmel yeah here he is with all of the false prophets and he says and I and I stand alone as God's prophet and the god that answers by fire let him be God this is part of the identified Christ of all ages that's why the prophet of God said watch he said it was Christ in David my bones they stare at me he said it was Christ in Ezekiel I see a wheel within a wheel he sees the Prophet Jeremiah crying and weeping over Jerusalem it was Christ it was not Jesus it was the Christ of God that anointing and that anointing has led and evolved the evolution of God himself Through Time and let me say this you if you're a seed Gene of God you're part of that evolution history keeps repeating itself we've been there before I remember the first time that I saw the book A man sent from God and I opened the front pages and I saw the one of being in a tent and the photographer was at the back of the tent and the people were turned around looking at the photographer I had never read the book I had never seen the picture before I'm 18 years old I don't know nothing about this magic I looked at that picture and I said the faces of the people said I wasn't there how do I know I was there because there's something that responds no man speak like this man it's a familiar place and all of a sudden bang I was there when he was preaching Serpent's Seed when he was opening the seals I was there can you say Amen to that invisible Union of the bride of Christ couple long quotes here if I could I'm going to read just the highlighted portion and any son is the attributes of his father and just as you were in the genes of your father in the body of your father when he was a young boy you were in him yet he could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you but then through the bedding grounds of a mother you were brought forth into the Earth and become in the image of your father then he could have fellowship with you so were you Sons and Daughters of God before there even was a moon stars or a molecule now watch he he goes from a natural to spiritual you were Sons and Daughters of God for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before you don't know nothing about it why you forgot it let me just for a moment say that because I'm not giving you the quote but you all know it he says it many times he said when Satan rose up and he preached his sermon in heaven he said you were there and Satan preached his his sermon and he caused excuse my mind but it may be a third or two-thirds of Heaven the stars filled with him and he said and there was a small group that was left behind and they said we will not bow amen they didn't believe the story and God said I am well pleased because they cannot deny themselves because when they deny themselves they deny me and so God and brother Brown said wiped away your memory you remember nothing about it and down through time here he watches over the seed in your great great great and on down and on down and so forth and all the way down and your mom and dad finally got together and bang you come and guess what you're no mistake God watched over that seed and your great great great great great great great and he should have died and this and that and everything but God watched over spared his life and this and that and guess what Bane you're here okay and he says he took a little bit of ting you remember that he said he's like making a bell he took a little Ting out of your great great grandpa and he took one a little bit out of this one and a little bit of that one and he makes it all together you wonder why you are so unique because you're a mixture of lineage amen of your great great great great great Royal lineage Royal lineage all right in verse or in paragraph 61 therefore assures your Gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual Gene had to be in God because you're an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world right no way around it that's right now now we notice then that life being in you God's life being in you from the foundation of the world how many of you believe it things that are to be brother Branham says therefore you walked with him you were in him when he was on the Earth you suffered with him you died with him you were buried with him and now you're risen with him and manifested attributes of God setting in Heavenly places already raised resurrected to New Life and setting in Heavenly places in Christ's old Christ Jesus oh that means so much nowadays church that means so much to us to see ourselves positionally placed in Jesus Christ now I don't have the quote but just from memory brother Brenham says I want to tell you the Rapture is in you now he said don't resent this he said the Rapture is in you now how many of you believe that let me see this there's nothing you can do to try to work it up to make it happen there's nothing you can't pray enough you can't live righteous enough you can't do anything it has nothing to do with you it's got everything to do with the seed and God's covenant and he's watching over you and he that begun the good work in you he will finish it somebody give God praise this morning [Applause] let me see this and may I say it as humbly as I can I realize that what I am seeing others may not I know some of you are not getting it but I can't help you to see what I see now brother Brenham let me just throw this because I'm not throwing you a curveball I'm not wanting to strike you out I want to jog your memory brother brennaman questions and answers between the six and seven seal he says now when this seventh seal comes before you I know you're not getting it you're not supposed to get it he said well you say brother Brown he said no no no just wait yeah huh don't put no interpretation to it yeah but brother no no when you go listen to that I played that quote to you before where you hear his voice so what I'm saying is I know some of you are not getting it that's okay you will in time some of you are slow of heart to believe all that to Prophet has said that's okay some students in the same class under the same teacher some get accelerated very quickly and others are a little slow they just need a little further explanation they need the teacher to go over it one more time they need one more sermon do you understand what I'm saying amen but I can't help seeing what I see I believe that God is taking me into the things where he said greater things shall you see I want to say it I'm seeing it I know others are seeing it in fact when you get around them we go to getting excited together yes you don't believe it just sit down with brother Paul Lovell sometime you go to breakfast with him on Monday morning because he's been feeding on the word the whole time you know what you said Sunday and so yeah amen yes brother on I tell you and he sits there and sometimes he beats yeah he does it's just he can't contain his excitement I hold on to my cup of coffee when I'm around here and I love a man who gets excited about what he believes I love to see a man who gets so excited because he's he's being revelated and stimulated not by music no but by the word being revealed to you Hallelujah and it starts a song inside of you it starts to dance inside of you it starts a movement inside of you it has nothing to do with everyone else it's between you and God hallelujah I've been in familiar places it gets so plain for me they have a trouble trying to show you I'm not a good teacher but I do want to do this I want to declare unto you the whole counsel of God someone had come to me recently and I certainly appreciate it he tells me he said brother Ron you've been over teaching on certain subjects you need to get job off the ashy I own that brother I do I take it very seriously I realized that when I study you know what my problem is Jonathan I study exhaustive I don't just look up a quote and I just look up a quote that fits what maybe what I see because if the prophet of God begins to talk about the third poll look at all of the quotes on third floor are you understanding with me don't just take that one that kind of fits in Hallelujah I believe that we are wearing out some of the quotes that preachers are seeing and they're wearing it out and over and over and don't you believe this and don't you believe that well there's more keep reading keep reading there's more once in a while to come across a quote that you don't understand it shakes you wow why did he say that he causes you to start thinking [Applause] [Music] I want you to be a parent just a repeater Polly want a cracker no not not to just see but have it here amen not just a repeater when I what I teach and I preach at this church is because I feel led to teach and to preach it not because of what others are doing understand although at times it may look but you know let me just be honest with you too I'm not out here streaming everybody else's services huh I don't I don't go out here and once in a while somebody will send me a uh a video of a brother of what he preached oh yeah I'll go listen to it yeah I hate my nice wonderful but honestly I am so embedded into this message I'm not really interested on what this one says and his interpretation and his opinion because I want to see I want to have it straight from the horse's mouth or may I say the prophets mouth say what I say on those tapes is that okay with you so excuse me um I am an oddball I have been since I came into this message it is one of the first tapes that I listened to and it's the first book that I physically owned a spoken word book the oddball and I read it and I read it and I reread it and I read it again sure and he remember that that man he says hey he says see that car going down the road he said if you take away all of the nuts it's nothing but a bunch of junk I am a nut but I'm threaded to the great bolt that every time he makes a turn huh and crank it down yeah come on man because every turn you make every sermon I hear I'm cranked up that much higher Hallelujah I want you to understand what God is doing in this message is he is bringing a bride to maturity he is bringing her to higher Heights like John John come up you there come up out of this nonsense come up out of this all of this nonsense and denominational ideas I have called you to come up into Heavenly places I want to bring you to a familiar place I want to bring you I want to stimulate you I don't want it to be just my music I don't want it to be by some man I want to do it in the secret of his Tabernacle get alone I'll meet you in there I want to say I've met him yes now so if you don't mind I am the Oddball and the older I get the more odd I become I do I the brother that brought me to the message one of them he backslid and went away from it he said brother wrong we don't we no longer believe the message he called me up they moved back to California all of their children you know their daughter played a piano for their pastor they all were holding us dressed and he said brother Ron we'd like you to come visit us in California and I said well I don't go to caliber for you very often I said ever since that God called me out of there I really I take it very serious about going back and so he said well if you ever come they live in San Bernardino just as you drop off the mountains you you cross the San Andreas Fault come down into San Bernardino the valley there he said why don't you come visit us I said his name's Richard I said Richard I'd love that he said but there's one thing I request he said don't bring your Branham Doctrine with you the man that told me about brother Branham the man that we fellowship with we listened to tapes together we rejoiced over the things we heard and he said don't bring it with you when you come I said Richard I'm sorry to tell you I can't be separated I am the message the message and I have become one there's been an invisible Union you can't you can't separate me from the Bible why the word is inside of me the message which is Christ is inside of me hallelujah how many of you can say that's with me also I am the message I am taking this now let me share with you what I feel is the reason why there's confusion coming among the message right now it is dependent upon which book you're eating because remember Christ took the scroll of Isaiah found where it was written of him and he opened the book and he read the scriptures he identified his ministry in Scripture amen and then he closed the book you can have an open book and the same one that opened it closes it so this message I want to say is an open book to those who have the Holy Ghost who to them the revealing of Christ continues there's a continual unveiling and the message going on and on and on can you say Amen why because you're eating from the open book but there's a some who've got the same book but it's closed read the same message listen to the same tape was seven seal ain't even open there ain't no way he could have this Prophet could have fulfilled Revelation 10 7 and then they go off because you know what what happens if you don't have revelation of the Holy Spirit you have carnal interpretation of man and you learn and you can be ever learning but never come to the knowledge of Truth amen I'm afraid we've learned this message yup we've boiled it down let's condense this message it's a long dress it's uncut here huh it's no makeup no jewelry no shorts on demand uncut hair we don't we have hey we got it down we're trying to conform we do a good job of it we preach it so hard we tighten it down and I'll tell you what we have people that have been raised up and around this message for years maybe 30 40 years some of them even preachers turn right around because it's not revealed to them because what happened they went by by head knowledge they went by man's interpretation and I'll tell you what when you follow a man if that man falls you fall with him but if you're following not the man but the Christ in the man that even if the man falls you don't fall why because Christ never did fall amen Hallelujah we all got problems we all got issues that's true but I serve a God who doesn't have issues I serve a God who brings me to higher Heights and deeper depths in Christ amen so you are either eating from the open book or the closed book right that's why Doctrine well prophets got to rise again come on the scene because you know what we ain't even got Rapture and faith and and he's got to fly the mostly airplane got to shoot a brown bear he's got to do this and this pretty soon we got an itinerary don't we yeah well listen God is his own interpreter yeah yeah right God don't need you to speculate just say what he said amen God God fulfills his word by bringing it to pass amen how many of you believe that so you're even eating from the open book or a closed book or you're constantly eating from everybody else's table through the internet I don't mind go ahead I will not forbid you to go and listen to other ministers but I will tell you not all that say they are of Israel are of Israel because they hang up the shingle of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10 7 don't mean they're in the message you wait until you see the fruits of the message in them all kinds of denominational spirits and one rising up and this one rising up pretty soon we've divided the whole body sick of it it's amazing how many different doctrines we can have within the what we all got the same Bible we all got the same message boy I'll tell you what just look at uh some major subject how about marriage and divorce because that will be the biggest issue until the very end why it goes back to the original sin qualifications of a minister Church order music taking up an offering foot washing communion brother random says now look all of you now I'm giving you an example and he said here but he says every church is Sovereign is that true The Sovereign if you want to pass the plate Pass the Plate because I do have a quote brother Brown said if you fail to pass a plate you deny somebody an ability to give in an offering and he said and yet you can put a box in the back or you can do it you know he never said online we didn't have the online back then duh do you understand what I'm saying but he did say pay ties and he said Pay ties to where you're getting fed and he also said he said have a home Church and he says and have a place that you call your post to duty any of you in the military any of you served military time let me see hands there's brother Steve yeah huh Dave pollock a couple others hey if you were in the military and you got orders to go somewhere and let's say you go from Fort Huachuca to be sent to Vietnam and you're there with a company and you're with this regiment and whatever and that becomes your post of Duty brother Brenham says all of you he says have somewhere that you are called to a post of Duty and when God has called you there you be faithful and you don't leave until you get orders to go elsewhere otherwise if you leave your posted Duty what do they call it well he went AWOL what does that mean absent without leave what happens to a guy who in AWOL yeah you in trouble buddy don't go AWOL no State you're posted dude amen amen now I'm I'm just um you're bringing some things to you brother Ram said how about the gifts in the assembly whether it be tongues prophecies foot washing communion all of those things I want you to understand that we have a guideline that he has already said and he says whenever you have a question go back and listen to this tape is that right then why in the world do we have so many divisions because when you have ministers who disagree with another Minister what happens is you draw a wall right now I did an exhaustive study on disagreeing with a brother okay exhausted you find as many quotes where Brethren said well people-wide they disagree with me and he said as far as East from West why my wife and I disagree even over pie right or different and he says listen I don't care you can disagree with me as far as East from West you're welcome to come to this church just don't so Discord and he said don't have a disagreeable spirit huh well I'll tell you what you don't see it the way I see it you're out of here huh mean as a junkyard dog I don't ask all of you to believe exactly everything see it exactly I see everything no but I think we shouldn't be disagreeable amen you ever disagreed with somebody over a doctrinal issue and it severed your fellowship now how childish is that yeah that's childish well I'll tell you well huh who said you're right who said you're right excuse me my wife tells me never use me as an example [Music] her and I will have a time of intense Fellowship over something I said why is your opinion better than mine are you the authority now I I just said okay okay all right now I tell you what she's very good at colors I'm not I'm colorblind I I've told you before I see Reds and yellows and blues and greens but together with my eyes open ah you guys all hey yeah it's red that's orange you got blue pants on yeah yeah light nice light blue shirt I see those things okay but uh thank God that I have both eyes open because otherwise I have Kodachrome and ectochrome any of you remember any of you take pictures years ago 35 millimeter film huh if you're a photographer Kodachrome he would go outside you want you or or with pictures of of facial features you want the nice Hue of the skin and everything you'd like to take it that's Kodachrome but if you go outside and you want to take pictures of trees and leaves and lakes and oceans and all and you want the intensity blues and greens okay then you've got ectochrome you took the pictures same film just different processing internet you understand what I'm talking about so anyway we all see things a little bit differently amen is that right if we all saw an accident out here on the street and an officer asked us to give us a report give him a report of the accident we'd all see a little bit different do you understand so does that mean that we got to get upset and call somebody else that they're wrong because they see it differently ah stop it that's jolly amen that's childish so the open book is revealed to you by the Holy Spirit wow my the clothes book is subject to carnal and human understanding and self-interpretation so it depends on which book you're eating from because the same book that he opened he also closed do you see that the opening of the word what we call the third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed praise God listen my Epiphany if I could call it that the time when my pastor sent me over to Europe to start the spoken word office the first spoken word office outside of Jeffersonville and the wife and I we moved over to to Germany and we started in office now until that time I never had a complete set of tapes do you remember when you used to go right to voice of God and you'd get the little package of tapes and they'd send it to you and as soon as you paid for that they send you the next but how many of you can say I never had a complete set of tapes do you know how much a set of tapes from 47 to 65 yeah five grand how many of you got five grand yo okay man here you go man no if you were like we we live paycheck to paycheck but this was the first time wow I got all of the cassettes from 47 to 65. put them on the shelves put them in their chronological order got as many books we got the church age book man sent from God you name it whatever books voice of God had or spoken word had at that time they were in our office and we were sending and giving them out to anyone who was asking for when we moved to Europe Sandy help me out how many people were on the mailing list of spoken word when we moved to Europe huh 43. 43 people in France in Italy in Spain in Germany in Holland in Switzerland 43 whopping Mega Church Believers why because it was in English if you spoke French and you know parlez-vous English right why if I gave you a book in English and you polybu Francaise yeah yeah huh if you know French why would you want an English book hey that that's a no-brainer right so but I told Brother Joseph excuse me but I'm gonna I'm gonna give you some real personal stuff when Joseph Branham took over spoken word because all of you you older people here remember spoken word is where you went and got the books all the printed books how many remember that Roy borders Roy borders spoken word publication and in the front of every one of the book this book is given you free of charge it is the transliteration in other words does anybody know what transliteration means it means exactly as it was spoken no correction if brother Brown said now Moses built the ark and went through the tribulation e we change it and we put Noah no transliteration it's exactly as the way it was preached now you don't have to stumble over little mistakes how many of you make mistakes like that all the time I I tell my family I I've sat at the table I've said something my kid said no dad you said that wrong I said no I didn't what is this thing hello hello anyway I've said something and my kid said dad you said it wrong no I didn't I look at you know Amos we yeah Dad you blew it yeah uh you know Rebecca yeah Dad no I didn't you just heard it wrong sometimes I wish I had a a recording going full time but then I'd have to eat crow now and then oh yeah I'm sorry I did yeah but I thought I said it right so don't take what I said take what I thought right because we've all done it we've all made mistakes now I'll tell you what's happening within the message let me throw this out here so that you understand there's a lot of people that are seeing I had a brother call me from Ecuador yesterday he said brother Ron different ones ministers are leaving the message because of little discrepancies of what brother Branham said uh you know he made a mistake here he made a mistake over there or something well how many of us don't make mistakes okay well they made your own little things and say well if he was a prophet of God he did and let me give you a quote brother Brown said I've I have showed to you today in the Bible that all of God's Prophet make mistakes but God makes no mistakes you know I love that God shows us that Moses made a mistake now I don't Rejoice over the fact that he made a mistake but I realize that a is human man if he made a mistake like that and him being a prophet following the pillar of fire what about me little on me man I make mistakes oh I got hope God there is still hope amen because we all make the little mistakes and and so little discrepancies they said well uh something about 3 500 people in uh in India there's no way it could have been 3 500 people well I want to ask you a Biblical question Jesus fed how many people with fishes and Loaves five thousand how do you know it's five thousand that's a round number do they have somebody click click click click click click click click click yeah Jesus five thousand what if it was only 400 4853 would you freak out nah don't stop it why in the world do we let here's what I make the challenge I said show me in his Doctrine where he's wrong godhead water baptism Church bride 70 weeks of Daniel huh show me those things no because you know what they don't attack that they attack some kind of little uh a little uh something about a number oh give me a break okay now I've told you before that this is a Time released Revelation I'm not going to finish this I'm going to have to I'm going to have to to come back and preach this in a couple months because I leave today to go on vacation and I'm nervous already my wife was so excited yesterday this is cute I love it she was so cute she's packing her bag and she was cheese man she's happy she's singing her little song like that she said honey I'm ready to go to the airport right now this was last night I said man you're just like me I'm already getting in vacation mode I'm ready to get the sunscreen yeah I you know but listen no my brother my musicians if you come listen I love you guys I love you very much and I want to preach to you the whole counsel of God I don't want to just isolate and pick certain quotes that fit with perhaps the way I see it and yes I have I have over studied at times and I've over kept job on the ash sheep longer than I should have I'm sorry so you all forgive me you pray for me ask the Lord to give me more revelation um and I believe God will do it but I'm excited for what I see going on in my relationship with God that's what stimulates me huh I do I'm in love with him and this message more than I've ever been I don't know about you but love it increases with age it does it's like wine it gets stronger every day with Jesus sweeter than the day before [Music] I'm going to say this in closing I came up in a pretty rough neighborhood childhood did a lot of things wrong as a young boy got in the wrong crowd [Music] raised up in Los Angeles [Music] and I went to a Bible study Mitch Buckingham asked me to go to a Bible study gave my heart to the Lord and for four years in high school I tried doing right [Music] wow you know do you know what church the first church that I went to that I called the man my pastor any of you ever heard of Chuck Smith Calvary Chapel wow it was just a small little church small and you know what it was it was just a bunch of hippies and Surfers and long-haired and you know what the thing that I loved about Chuck is Chuck loved God it emanated from me and we went there and now they've got something out called the Jesus Revolution the Jesus Revolution they showed a bunch of hippies and long-haired everybody coming to church and how that it changed from a denominational Viewpoint to bringing all of these in and man all of a sudden his church just bow exploded I was part of the Jesus Revolution I was a counselor for Billy Graham Crusade 1969 Anaheim Convention Center the largest crusade in the history of Billy Graham crusade for young people [Music] I still have the letter I had even for years even the the badge and the paraphernalia that you wear because I was a counselor for Billy Graham Crusade but I got disillusioned because of false teaching because I was sincere you talk about sincere [Music] we passed out tracks we you guys what's that the Rose Parade Pasadena California largest parade in the world I believe Rose Freight it's in it is an all-night party the night before if any of you so we as young people our parents would let us go and we stayed up all night and guess what we did we passed out tracks about Jesus Christ all night we prayed for people that's how sincere we were I was part of the Jesus Revolution but now I'm part of the Jesus evolution why because God what he did he took me higher he took me out of the nonsense and showed me that I need to be more in love with him and I realize the long hair's got to go all of the different things because when God washes you he washes you from the inside to the outside Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change amen I love you guys thank you for allowing me as your pastor to take some things and teach it and please don't ever think I'm going after anybody I'm not God knows my heart I I just want to teach you the whole counsel of God [Music] amen so I finished with this this here when I
