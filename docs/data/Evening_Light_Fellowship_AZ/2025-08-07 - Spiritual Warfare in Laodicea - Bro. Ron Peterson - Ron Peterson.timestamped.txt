[32:42] but there is a light about the evening
[32:45] time. We thank you that you have sent to
[32:48] us that light called the message of the
[32:50] hour, the word of God revealed in its
[32:53] season. We thank you for that. Father, I
[32:56] pray that you will help us to be patient
[32:59] and understanding even as I go over some
[33:02] of these topics because Father, teaching
[33:05] is a different ministry than than
[33:08] preaching. So, I pray that you will help
[33:11] our saints as we go over these things. I
[33:14] pray, Father, give me uh wisdom and
[33:17] discernment.
[33:18] And I pray that you will just bless your
[33:21] people tonight as we study your word. We
[33:24] thank you. We ask it in Jesus Christ's
[33:26] name.
[33:28] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank you,
[33:30] musicians. Appreciate it. Uh let's go in
[33:34] our Bibles, please. 2 Corinthians
[33:36] chapter 2. Then we'll go to 2
[33:38] Corinthians 10. And then we'll go to 1
[33:43] Timothy 1.
[33:46] Now when we talk about spiritual
[33:47] warfare, I want you to understand that
[33:49] even the Bible says that Jesus said, "I
[33:53] did not come to bring peace."
[33:57] &gt;&gt; But I came to bring division.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; And even it says that some of those of
[34:03] your own household
[34:06] &gt;&gt; will be of your worst enemies. That's
[34:07] what Jesus said.
[34:09] And he who loves father or mother,
[34:12] sister or brother more than they love me
[34:15] is not worthy of the kingdom.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; That's a pretty sharp uh straight and
[34:20] narrow message, is that not?
[34:22] &gt;&gt; So we have to understand, let our hearts
[34:24] be drawn towards him.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Okay. And God has given you children and
[34:30] a family and praise God for that. God re
[34:33] asks you to raise them up in the stature
[34:35] and and nurture of God that they might
[34:38] understand God. Now, they don't catch
[34:41] things until they get a little bit older
[34:43] because they're immature
[34:45] &gt;&gt; because they don't understand. But if
[34:47] you'll raise them up right and if you'll
[34:49] appeal to their heart rather than their
[34:52] head because you know most of them are
[34:54] are are just uh you know when I was a
[34:56] child I spake as a child understood as a
[34:59] child.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So have grace and patience with
[35:02] them and and remember daddies that the
[35:05] apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; So even the Bible says the way that you
[35:10] deal with your son and correct him, God
[35:12] will do the same with you.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; So God help us to be patient one with
[35:16] another and we uh be patient and
[35:20] understand. 2 Corinthians chapter 2
[35:23] verse 11. Lest Satan should get an
[35:26] advantage of us for we are not ignorant
[35:30] of his devices.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; I don't want him to take advantage.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; This is his Eden.
[35:38] He has taken 6,000 years to perfect it.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; He's perfected sin.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; This is the utopia for unbelief and sin.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; And it comes through the
[35:53] &gt;&gt; tree of knowledge. That's why everything
[35:55] that's why young people listen if we
[35:58] don't counterbalance
[35:59] &gt;&gt; right
[36:00] &gt;&gt; what the government forces you to have
[36:03] your children in school
[36:05] &gt;&gt; if we don't counterbalance that you'll
[36:07] become imbalanced
[36:08] &gt;&gt; that's right
[36:09] &gt;&gt; if you're not careful and you lose your
[36:11] equilibrium and get into college or
[36:13] something you're gone
[36:15] &gt;&gt; tree of knowledge
[36:17] &gt;&gt; eat you up
[36:19] &gt;&gt; but if you have a balance
[36:22] &gt;&gt; then you can stand the tests of of the
[36:24] enemy. 2 Corinthians 10. 2 Corinthians
[36:28] chap 10:es 3-5.
[36:34] For though we walk in the flesh, we do
[36:36] not war after the flesh.
[36:39] For the weapons of our warfare are not
[36:42] carnal.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; But mighty through God to the pulling
[36:48] down of strongholds. And I will be
[36:50] talking a little bit about what
[36:52] strongholds are in believers lives.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; How does a stronghold happen? How does
[36:58] the enemy come in? How does he take
[36:59] advantage of you?
[37:01] &gt;&gt; If you are ignorant and you don't study
[37:05] these things in spiritual warfare,
[37:07] brother Bram said, you can take an evil
[37:09] spirit and not even know it.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; And he just gets you off. He gets you to
[37:13] We're going to go through some of this
[37:15] stuff about strongholds and we're going
[37:17] to talk about uh these five gates to the
[37:20] spirit of man. You have five flesh gates
[37:23] to the outer court, five to the inner
[37:25] court, but you only have two gates that
[37:28] go to the soul. That's either faith or
[37:31] unbelief.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; So, and it isn't until faith, revelation
[37:35] is struck the heart of the person. You
[37:38] say, "Lord, come into my heart. Oh Lord,
[37:41] uh I have hid thy word in my heart that
[37:44] I learn not to sin against you.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And so um look at this now.
[37:52] So that they are mighty through God to
[37:55] the pulling down of strongholds, casting
[37:57] down imaginations,
[37:59] and every high thing that exaltth itself
[38:03] against the knowledge of God, and
[38:05] bringing into captivity
[38:08] every thought to the obedience of
[38:10] Christ.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Timothy 1. If you would turn
[38:16] back in your Bibles, 1 Timothy 1:es
[38:20] 18- 20.
[38:26] This charge I commit unto thee, son
[38:28] Timothy,
[38:30] according to the prophecies which went
[38:32] before on thee, that
[38:36] thou by them mightest war a good
[38:39] warfare. So listen, prophecies have gone
[38:42] before. He's uh he's got an
[38:46] understanding that he's being called of
[38:48] God and everything. But look that
[38:53] I want you to understand these things
[38:55] that you might war a good warfare.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Because you're entering a battle. Y
[39:01] &gt;&gt; holding faith and a good conscience
[39:03] which have which some having put away
[39:08] concerning faith have made shipwreck.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Do you know any shipwrecks within the
[39:14] message?
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Do you know some that have given up the
[39:18] faith
[39:19] &gt;&gt; and they've made shipwreck?
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; And it's not pretty.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; It's not.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Of whom is Himenius. Now here Paul
[39:30] mentions
[39:32] men's name. They were part of the early
[39:35] church. Of whom is Himenius and
[39:38] Alexander whom I have delivered unto
[39:40] Satan that they may learn not to
[39:43] blaspheme. May God bless the reading of
[39:45] his word. You can be seated this evening
[39:48] in the presence of God. All right. I
[39:52] want to talk this evening
[39:55] on entitle my sermon spiritual warfare
[40:00] in Laiusa.
[40:03] Spiritual warfare in Laiusa. And I want
[40:06] to take uh the subject of teaching your
[40:09] children about spiritual warfare. If
[40:12] they don't understand it and they're
[40:13] ignorant of it,
[40:16] uh it's so easy to take a
[40:20] spirit from the world, okay? And you
[40:24] start because whatever you yield your
[40:27] spirit to, you become the servant
[40:29] thereof.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; It's not being critical.
[40:34] It's not preaching the law. But I want
[40:37] all of you to understand, you must have
[40:40] understanding
[40:41] of why we believe what we believe.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; It all comes back from the Bible.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; And as we do some teaching on this, I
[40:49] want all of you to to put on your
[40:52] spiritual thinking caps and understand
[40:56] that we have now entered into the time
[40:59] of the greatest deception,
[41:02] a time of spiritual warfare that we've
[41:04] never seen. And it's coming to a head.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; You talk about people that have eaten
[41:09] from the tree of knowledge. And these
[41:11] are the leaders and these are the
[41:14] teachers and these are the professors
[41:17] and these are the people in the colleges
[41:19] that are teaching. And many of them lean
[41:22] so far left they're they're out of the
[41:25] picture. They're so filled with
[41:28] knowledge, as an example, that they
[41:31] don't know or cannot explain what is the
[41:33] difference between a man and a woman.
[41:36] Now, if you would have said 50 years ago
[41:38] that people would be saying, "Oh,
[41:40] there's more than two genders in the
[41:42] world," you'd think you're nuts.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; But it's happening. It's here.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; And uh people are identifying with all
[41:49] kinds of things.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; But we identify with one thing because
[41:54] we came from God. We're going back to
[41:56] God. Therefore, when the word of God is
[41:58] presented to you, you identify with it,
[42:01] &gt;&gt; not the world,
[42:03] &gt;&gt; but yet the world is doing everything
[42:05] that it can. And I want you to
[42:07] understand, your children are at risk.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Parents,
[42:11] &gt;&gt; you got children. Praise God. You raise
[42:13] them up. You got these little ones and
[42:15] we dedicate them and and they go to our
[42:17] Sunday schools and they learn Jesus
[42:20] loves me. This I know. They learn some
[42:22] Bible verses. that doesn't keep them.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; They must have an experience with God
[42:28] themselves
[42:29] &gt;&gt; in order for God to keep them. Now, I'm
[42:32] going to take some things and I want you
[42:34] each individual
[42:36] be acutely aware that every family,
[42:39] every church
[42:42] is going to have to fight for every
[42:46] promise of the word of God. It's not
[42:48] given to you.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to learn to fight.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're gonna fight, fight a
[42:53] good fight.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; If you're gonna fight, fight to win. If
[42:57] you're gonna play the game, play to win.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; I've never played a game. I've never
[43:02] done any of those things to want to just
[43:05] say, "Well, you know, it really doesn't
[43:07] matter." I get into it. Um, just sharing
[43:10] with you, I played baseball in in in
[43:13] school, went four years uh in high
[43:16] school and I was a fairly good player
[43:20] and never hit a home run in my life. I'm
[43:22] not a power hitter, but I uh uh I was
[43:26] using the top three of the lineup and uh
[43:29] I got on base and my batting average was
[43:31] usually way over 300. Um, and I scored.
[43:35] Whenever I got on base, I scored.
[43:38] And uh so anyway, uh
[43:42] I uh I went through a lot of things as a
[43:45] young man
[43:47] and I learned that if you're going to
[43:50] play a game, get into the game,
[43:53] &gt;&gt; okay? Get into the game.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Um and I was voted most inspirational, I
[43:59] think, every year when I played uh
[44:01] whatever team I was on. I just, you
[44:04] know, I'm not one of these guys. Okay.
[44:06] Well, we're behind uh 10 runs. Let's
[44:09] give up. No, I said, "Hey, the game
[44:10] ain't over till it's over."
[44:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Hey, you know, let's not try to hit the
[44:15] ball over the fence. Just hit a man,
[44:17] just hit a a base hit. That's all we
[44:20] want. Get on base
[44:22] &gt;&gt; or take a walk, you know? Hey, a walk is
[44:26] as good as a run when he when he comes
[44:28] around. So, anyway, I I'm not here to
[44:31] coach the team tonight. That's that's
[44:33] different. That's different. But uh none
[44:36] of you are exempt. You all will be
[44:38] tested.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; You all will be tried. The contest is
[44:42] on.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said you will meet him.
[44:45] And you better know how he fights. You
[44:48] better know how to protect yourself
[44:50] because if you don't, now the prophet
[44:52] said he's got one good lick coming at
[44:54] you.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; And he said you better each one of you
[44:58] have an Achilles tendon. If you know
[45:00] what we're talking about.
[45:02] Each one of you have an area you must
[45:05] keep protected.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; It may be different for each one of you.
[45:09] One of you it might be music. Music to
[45:12] me is is Listen, I don't listen to
[45:14] music. When I get home, I don't turn
[45:17] music on. It's not something that
[45:18] motivates me. Okay, some of you might
[45:21] have music. Musicians have to be very
[45:23] careful, as an example, what type of
[45:26] music they listen to.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay? Because music has a tendency
[45:30] to set a certain atmosphere and next
[45:33] thing you know it's got a little tempo
[45:35] and next thing you know you're be you're
[45:37] being moved by the tempo. Uh even though
[45:41] the song may have nice lyrics, may talk
[45:44] about Jesus, but you have to be
[45:47] extremely careful. So each one of you
[45:50] have areas in your life that you've got
[45:53] to stay guarded.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; They're all different.
[45:58] Okay, some of you it might be money,
[46:01] might be a career, might be an
[46:03] education, something uh you know, that's
[46:07] what motivates you. That's what uh gets
[46:10] you going. And if you're not careful,
[46:12] Satan will take that and pull pull you
[46:14] out onto a limb. When he gets you out on
[46:17] the limb, he'll cut the limb off and
[46:18] you'll go down with it. All right? So
[46:22] now Israel, I want you to understand
[46:24] because now we look at brother Brand
[46:26] preaches a sermon called Israel and the
[46:28] church.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; He's showing you that what happened to
[46:31] Israel is going to happen to the bride.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; The 144,000
[46:37] and the 10 virgins. Brother Bren makes
[46:41] this comparison showing that Israel once
[46:44] they were given the promised land and
[46:46] listen they come out of Egypt, praise
[46:48] the Lord,
[46:50] &gt;&gt; and they went through all of the trials
[46:52] and different things and are following
[46:53] Moses the pillar of fire and no matter
[46:56] how much of the supernatural they saw,
[46:59] they still had battles with the flesh.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; There were still Nathan and chorus.
[47:04] There were others within the group that
[47:06] was always trying to say Moses takes too
[47:09] much authority to himself. And there was
[47:12] always somebody there that had
[47:14] dissenting voices. That will happen in
[47:17] every
[47:19] uh time that God sends a message. Amen.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; So don't don't don't get distract
[47:23] distracted by the dissenting voices even
[47:27] that are associated with this message.
[47:29] We have quite a few shimeies that like
[47:32] to throw dirt on whether it be the
[47:34] ministry or on other churches. We need
[47:37] to quit fighting one another and fight
[47:39] the devil.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Okay? Fight the devil.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Okay? Because he's our enemy. It's not
[47:44] your brother. It's not uh your brother
[47:46] because he maybe doesn't understand it
[47:49] like you. Well, that's okay. That will
[47:51] be between him and God. The main thing
[47:54] is we keep our hearts right and that our
[47:56] lives will be exemplary of the life of
[48:02] Christ.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. So, Israel had all kinds of
[48:06] wars. God said, "I'm going to give you
[48:08] the promised land." But guess what? They
[48:10] cross over Jordan. And what the first
[48:12] thing they do? They have to fight. Are
[48:16] you kidding me? I I Wait a second. Wait
[48:19] a second. You mean Canaan going into the
[48:22] promised land? Um, is that heaven? No,
[48:26] it's not heaven. In heaven, there's not
[48:28] going to be any wars. Thank God for
[48:30] that. There was a war in heaven. That's
[48:32] where it all started.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Satan rose up and said, "I want to be
[48:36] like God. I want to raise my You all
[48:37] know the story." So, that battle, he was
[48:40] cast out of heaven, down to earth. And
[48:42] so, the earth became his domain
[48:44] temporarily. He's a squatter. Doesn't
[48:47] belong to him,
[48:48] &gt;&gt; but he's here. Nevertheless, and he has
[48:50] become the god of this evil age. That's
[48:53] right.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; And the only ones who understand,
[48:58] let's say, uh this position that he has
[49:02] in this age are message believers
[49:06] because we see
[49:08] um past the deception. Right.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; It's not the big You see, some people
[49:13] are in awe and everything because of big
[49:18] cathedrals and big stained glass
[49:21] windows. Even uh John when he said, "And
[49:25] I marveled at this scarlet colored uh
[49:28] woman who was decked with silver and
[49:30] gold and had on her name uh the
[49:33] blasphemies of God and and she was
[49:36] called Mystery Babylon." And I admired
[49:39] at her. And how many people admire just
[49:43] churches because it looks big and
[49:45] beautiful. God is not in beauty. He's in
[49:48] character.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; So it's not it's not We thank God for a
[49:53] nice church. Yeah. Praise the Lord. I
[49:55] came in a little bit early today, man.
[49:57] It said on my temperature of the car 113
[50:00] degrees. I said I told Bobby and him,
[50:03] they were here early, him and brother
[50:04] Paul. I said, "Thank God for air
[50:06] conditioning." Amen.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Okay? Because uh what did they do a
[50:11] hundred years ago when they gathered
[50:13] together? Let me tell you, they were
[50:14] tough believers.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; They came together. It didn't matter if
[50:17] it was outside in the shade of a tree or
[50:19] whatever. Hey, you were coming to hear
[50:21] the word of God. Sometimes I think we
[50:22] get too pampered.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we take it uh uh not as
[50:27] serious as we should.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; And so anyway, just as a pastor, I'm
[50:32] just telling you those things. They had
[50:34] to fight to possess the land. So will
[50:36] you
[50:40] &gt;&gt; think it not strange when these fiery
[50:42] trials to come upon you as though it be
[50:45] some strange thing? Listen, you're
[50:48] either going into a trial or coming out
[50:50] of one.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; But your whole life is going to be a
[50:53] trial. There are going to be times when
[50:54] wow, praise God, you you have an upward
[50:58] uh climb and and everything seems to be
[51:00] going good and then it plateaus off for
[51:01] a while. then it kind of uh slow things
[51:03] are not you know maybe a little bit of a
[51:05] dip and depends on uh your nar your
[51:08] nature your character but there's always
[51:10] hills and valleys and everything. We
[51:12] just pray that the graph of your life is
[51:16] going upward
[51:18] &gt;&gt; that if we were to look at the mountain
[51:19] tops and the peaks of the graph and we
[51:22] put a straight line it looks well he's
[51:24] going upward instead of he's flatlining
[51:26] or he's going downward.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Okay, a tree is known by its fruit. So
[51:31] the fruit you are bearing right now and
[51:33] the things that you are doing in your
[51:35] life right now will be you give you a
[51:38] good indication of the life you're
[51:40] living when he returns.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; So just look at your life right now and
[51:45] if you say I'm not doing too good
[51:47] chances are when he comes you'll be not
[51:49] doing too good.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; So now it's not by works oriented. We
[51:54] know that. But do not do not make grace
[51:57] a disgrace.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if you believe God and God
[52:01] gives you revelation, you will bring
[52:03] that into your life and it will manifest
[52:07] the faith that you say you have.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[52:13] Though you are raised in a message
[52:14] family, it doesn't make you a message
[52:16] believer.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Though you are raised in a message
[52:20] church, doesn't make you a message
[52:21] believer. Though you listen to tapes,
[52:23] that doesn't make you a message
[52:25] believer. You can press play and you can
[52:28] hear the word of God. But the Bible says
[52:30] to he that hath an ear, let him hear
[52:33] what the spirit is saying. So though the
[52:36] vocal cords of a messenger are being
[52:38] used and you can hear the enunciation of
[52:42] his voice, it isn't until you hear the
[52:45] voice behind the veil and you realize
[52:48] that God was using that prophet
[52:50] messenger to bring you back to the word
[52:54] of God.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's what prophets do.
[52:57] They they always bring you back to the
[53:00] it is written.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the word of God is our
[53:03] absolute.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; All right.
[53:08] Now, Ephesians 6. Let me go a little
[53:10] quickly now because I keep never
[53:12] finishing my sermon when I get up here.
[53:15] Ephesians 6:10-12.
[53:18] Finally, my brethren, be strong in the
[53:19] Lord and in the power of his might. Put
[53:22] on the whole armor of God that you may
[53:24] be able to stand against the ws of the
[53:27] devil, meaning his trickery. He's going
[53:30] to try to trick you, fool you, deceive
[53:32] you, sift you like wheat if he can.
[53:37] For we wrestle not against flesh and
[53:40] blood,
[53:42] &gt;&gt; but against principalities,
[53:46] against powers,
[53:48] against the rulers of the darkness of
[53:50] this world, against spiritual wickedness
[53:53] in high places. That's why you are going
[53:56] to fight in this end time. And it is a
[54:01] spiritual warfare. take off your little
[54:05] um mindset that you have that when I
[54:09] come into the message, my battle's over.
[54:12] No, it's just beginning.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Well, when I get the Holy Ghost, it's
[54:17] over. I'll be in a a place where I never
[54:20] make No, let me tell you, the devil,
[54:22] even with a Holy Ghost fililled
[54:23] believer, you still press the battle.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; You still fight to fight.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; You still got to do those things. You
[54:30] got to claim every promise, but you got
[54:33] to fight for it.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now,
[54:37] so
[54:40] Satan has perfected this Eden.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; It is now filled with all kinds of
[54:48] principalities and powers. Amen.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; I'll be talking later about all of the
[54:54] different things that will affect
[54:56] and especially our youth unless they
[54:59] understand spiritual war. I'm going to
[55:02] show you in the scripture. Turn with me
[55:04] to the book of Judges. Judges chapter 3.
[55:08] Judges 3:es 1-7.
[55:12] Now these are the nations which the Lord
[55:15] left. Who left them? God did.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; He left them. He didn't clear it all
[55:21] out. He said, "Go and possess the land
[55:24] and all of the nations that are before
[55:26] you. I'm going to wipe them out.
[55:30] They're dust." No,
[55:34] he left them there. Here's the reason.
[55:38] To prove Israel
[55:41] by them. He's going to prove Israel by
[55:44] the nations he left. Oh, you say you're
[55:46] a message believer.
[55:48] He's going to make you prove it.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Even as many of Israel as had not known
[55:56] the wars of Canaan. Wow. Now, understand
[56:01] our youth
[56:03] have got to understand spiritual
[56:05] warfare. And here he's giving them an
[56:08] example. Many of the young people of
[56:10] Israel had not known the wars of Canaan.
[56:15] But God left some of these nations to
[56:17] try you.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; God did it
[56:20] &gt;&gt; only that the generation of the children
[56:22] of Israel might know to teach them war.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; You mean he left all of those tribes
[56:30] there to teach you war? Yes, he did.
[56:33] Understand it is a battle.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; And least such as before knew nothing
[56:42] thereof. You young people, wake up.
[56:45] Smell the coffee.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; This is not an easy thing. Jesus said,
[56:50] "You'll be hated of all men."
[56:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; They will say all manner of evil against
[56:56] you falsely.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; But blessed are you
[56:59] &gt;&gt; for your eyes
[57:01] &gt;&gt; see, and your ears hear what others do
[57:04] not see.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Thank God. You ought to you ought to
[57:07] rejoice. If you're having a hard time
[57:09] and people persecute you, thank God. He
[57:12] said, "Those that live godly in Christ
[57:15] Jesus shall suffer persecution." If you
[57:18] can't handle it,
[57:20] &gt;&gt; you ain't got it.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; You understand? Come on. This ain't
[57:25] babying you.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; You go to school and they make fun of
[57:29] the way you dress or you boys, you know,
[57:32] because you don't cuss and curse.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Ah, you ought to thank God I'm not like
[57:38] them.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. dare to be different.
[57:45] Now verse four, and they were to prove
[57:48] Israel by them
[57:50] to know whether they would hearken unto
[57:53] the commandment of the Lord. So God let
[57:56] him be there to see if you really are
[57:58] going to use the word in your life
[58:00] &gt;&gt; to keep the commandments.
[58:03] Verse
[58:05] five. And the children of Israel dwelt
[58:07] among the Canaanites, the Hitittites,
[58:09] the Amorites, the Parizzites, the
[58:12] Hittites, the Jebusites, and all of the
[58:14] other websites.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; We're going to get into that because you
[58:21] know what? It's these websites and these
[58:23] things of the internet. God's got a net
[58:26] and Satan's got a net.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; God is the gospel net. He cast it out
[58:32] there. Right. But Satan's got a net.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Be careful lest you be caught in the net
[58:40] of Satan. It's a snare of the enemy.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Okay, watch this. And so he left the
[58:46] Canaanites, the Hittites, and all of
[58:48] them to prove them to see if you're
[58:52] going to keep the commandment of the
[58:53] Lord. Under no circumstance does a
[58:56] believer
[58:58] go out or date an unbeliever.
[59:02] no circumstance. Are we aware of that?
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Capiche comp
[59:10] &gt;&gt; or are you an exception?
[59:13] &gt;&gt; You think God loves you more than the
[59:14] rest of them?
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Now watch. He says, "I'm leaving them
[59:18] there to test you."
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you're going to be tested,
[59:22] young people. You're going to be tested.
[59:25] And the one you choose or the you look
[59:28] after shows a reflection of what's in
[59:30] you. Amen.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; You say you're a good message believer
[59:32] and you choose some Jezebel out of the
[59:34] world. Let me tell you,
[59:38] &gt;&gt; because the one you're choosing is a
[59:40] reflection of the spirit that's in you.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now,
[59:44] so here's watch the result. He says, "I
[59:48] left them there to prove you." So, and
[59:51] they took their daughters to their
[59:52] wives.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Wait a second. Didn't you have youth
[59:57] meetings? Didn't you tell them what's
[59:58] wrong with you, Moses? Joshua, why
[1:00:00] didn't you teach them? They did teach
[1:00:02] them. They just didn't listen.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; And they took their daughters to be
[1:00:07] their wives and gave their daughters to
[1:00:09] their sons and served their gods. Not
[1:00:14] the God of Israel. Served their gods.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Illegal union.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; You let somebody pair themselves with
[1:00:22] somebody from the world, you you're in
[1:00:25] trouble.
[1:00:27] And if you're not careful, there is the
[1:00:29] odd time you can marry somebody and uh
[1:00:33] you know what, they weren't a a message
[1:00:35] believer or something and you were and
[1:00:37] next thing you know they came in. But
[1:00:40] that's usually the exception of the
[1:00:42] rule,
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Usually it is that they don't and then
[1:00:46] you you're unequally yolked and you're
[1:00:49] going to have a hard time.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; All right. So now uh and their children
[1:00:56] did evil in the sight of the Lord and
[1:01:00] forgot the Lord their God and serve
[1:01:03] Balum and their groves. Wow. God left
[1:01:06] those there to test you, to prove you,
[1:01:08] to see if you're going to do what you
[1:01:10] know to do. And the first thing you
[1:01:12] know, wives, marriage, this and that. My
[1:01:17] do you see? And what did they do?
[1:01:20] Illegal union. Wrong. got to serving
[1:01:23] other gods. How quickly it happens.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 11:es 1-4.
[1:01:30] I would to God you bear with me a little
[1:01:32] in my folly and indeed bear with me. For
[1:01:35] I am jealous over you with a godly
[1:01:37] jealousy. For I have espoused you to one
[1:01:40] husband that I may present you as a
[1:01:42] chasteed virgin to Christ.
[1:01:45] But I fear less by any means
[1:01:48] as the serpent beguiled Eve. So now he's
[1:01:51] taking a type from the Old Testament. I
[1:01:54] am over you with a godly jealousy. I
[1:01:58] don't want nobody fooling with him. And
[1:02:01] he says, "Lest by any means as the
[1:02:03] serpent." So we'll look at that in a
[1:02:05] moment. As the serpent begal Eve through
[1:02:08] his subtlety,
[1:02:10] so your minds, so here's the
[1:02:12] battleground. The minds, amen,
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; should be corrupted from the simplicity
[1:02:18] that is in Christ.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Before the opening of the seals, what's
[1:02:23] the first sermon? Brother Brandon
[1:02:24] preaches God revealed in simplicity.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; So you understand God in simplicity.
[1:02:34] Don't make this gospel hard. It's not.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even a wafering man can hear the
[1:02:41] good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:02:43] Amen. Okay. Now, watch this. Satan used
[1:02:46] the channel of reasoning
[1:02:49] to get Eve to stand there long enough.
[1:02:52] Now, Brother Brandham said it was years
[1:02:54] and years of her meeting her alone in
[1:02:57] the garden. Oh, hi Eve. Boy, you're sure
[1:03:00] looking good today. Oh, your cheeks are
[1:03:02] so rosy. I'm just kind of ad libbing
[1:03:05] here a little bit.
[1:03:06] You know what? It was years
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; right
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; of meeting her and then finally finally
[1:03:13] okay when he got her to stand still long
[1:03:15] enough and he used the channel of
[1:03:16] reasoning. So now watch here's what is
[1:03:19] going to come against you is Satan will
[1:03:22] use to most of you he will use one of
[1:03:27] the channels of the five senses to your
[1:03:30] spirit because if he can affect your
[1:03:32] spirit he's got you. Okay. So, greatest
[1:03:37] battle ever fought 62. The battle raged
[1:03:40] when Eve opened up her mind to listen to
[1:03:44] her reasoning.
[1:03:46] That's the flu it come in. That's the
[1:03:50] channel it run down her reasoning. She
[1:03:53] in her soul, she reasoned. Her eyes was
[1:03:56] sight. And he goes on talked about
[1:03:58] seeing uh this subtle beast of the field
[1:04:01] and he was a fairer man than her husband
[1:04:04] and so on and so forth. Paragraph 117.
[1:04:07] First thing she did, she opened her mind
[1:04:09] and when she did, human reasoning caught
[1:04:11] it.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Now, greatest battle ever fought. That's
[1:04:15] what all of you are going to be dealing
[1:04:17] with certain things in your mind because
[1:04:20] the greatest battle fought is in your
[1:04:22] mind. Amen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; So I fear less by any means the devil
[1:04:26] will take advantage of you and we are
[1:04:28] not ignorant of the devil's devices.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Okay. So that's the reason we teach you
[1:04:34] these things. Well, brother Ron, why
[1:04:35] don't you talk about the love of God and
[1:04:37] Christ at Calvary and and you know all
[1:04:40] of these things. Listen, you should be
[1:04:42] beyond that right now.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, we know Christ him crucified. But
[1:04:47] we've got to understand in spiritual
[1:04:49] warfare once we become a Christian and
[1:04:51] we start walking we're gonna have to
[1:04:53] fight.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; So you otherwise you you might become
[1:04:58] another one who is a shipwreck like
[1:05:01] Himenius and Alexander.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; He said turn them over to the devil for
[1:05:05] the destruction of their flesh.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; They learn not to blasphe. So many
[1:05:10] people within this message are saying
[1:05:12] such blasphemous things,
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; you know, and then trying to trying to
[1:05:16] say the prophet of God made a mistake
[1:05:18] here and there. Listen, he was a human.
[1:05:21] He made mistakes. I'll give you the
[1:05:22] quote. Brother Bram said, I prove to you
[1:05:25] today that all the prophets, all the men
[1:05:28] of God made their mistakes, but God
[1:05:29] makes no mistakes. Listen, I thank God
[1:05:33] that our Bible shows us whether it's
[1:05:35] Abraham, whether it's Elijah, or any one
[1:05:38] of them, they made their mistakes.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; And yet God makes no mistakes. He comes
[1:05:43] in there and corrects the prophet. He
[1:05:45] corrects his children. He corrects
[1:05:47] Abraham. Why? Because love is
[1:05:49] corrective. As many as I love, I rebuke
[1:05:51] and chasen. If God is chasening you,
[1:05:54] it's it's proof that he loves you.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, others get away with it. And
[1:06:00] look at them. Yeah. Well, they ain't his
[1:06:02] either.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; A bastard child,
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; will not receive correction.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; He doesn't waste his time. But on you
[1:06:14] try to get away with it. Whackle.
[1:06:16] Five-fold ministry.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. No pain, no gain.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Okay. So I'll be teaching on the five
[1:06:26] inlets to the spirit man. They are
[1:06:31] memory, imagination, conscience,
[1:06:34] affection and reasoning. Years ago,
[1:06:36] brother Biscoll says uh I have done
[1:06:40] relational association and I say my car
[1:06:43] m I c a r
[1:06:46] memory, imagination, conscience,
[1:06:48] affection. Everybody wants my car.
[1:06:52] You understand?
[1:06:54] So think about these memory,
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; imagination,
[1:07:01] conscience, affection. Let your
[1:07:04] affections not be on the things of this
[1:07:06] world. Some of you are going to have
[1:07:08] horrible times in your flesh. Why?
[1:07:11] Because your affections are the thing on
[1:07:13] the things of this world.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Hey, listen. Take no
[1:07:17] thought for tomorrow.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Seek first the kingdom of God and his
[1:07:20] righteousness.
[1:07:22] Okay. So, and reasoning. And so,
[1:07:26] understand the devil's going to use
[1:07:27] reasoning. And so, we'll look into that.
[1:07:32] I'm going to show you now as the serpent
[1:07:35] begal Eve. So, how did he do it? Genesis
[1:07:38] 3:13.
[1:07:40] And the Lord God said unto the woman,
[1:07:43] "What is thou that thou hast done?" And
[1:07:45] the woman said, "The serpent beguiled
[1:07:47] me."
[1:07:48] Now, that's a word we don't use a whole
[1:07:50] lot. Beguiled.
[1:07:52] In Hebrew, the word beguiled.
[1:07:55] Nasha. It means to lead astray.
[1:08:00] It means to delude or to morally seduce.
[1:08:05] The serpent seduced me. How did he do
[1:08:08] it? He used words first, then he
[1:08:10] physically took her.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Understand that? words first, then the
[1:08:16] physical act took later.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; That's how you got seducing spirits. Get
[1:08:22] into the church. What are they?
[1:08:23] Fornicating, adulterous,
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; enticing, seducing,
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; lascivious.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; All having the enticement of something
[1:08:34] of the flesh. You see,
[1:08:38] religious spirits are unclean spirits.
[1:08:40] Religious
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; people
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; have unclean spirits.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; So the serpent beguiled me and I did
[1:08:51] eat.
[1:08:54] It means to deceive and with treacherous
[1:08:57] cunning and skillful deceit by using
[1:09:01] words. God uses words to as many as
[1:09:04] would believe my words.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Because my words are spirit and they are
[1:09:09] alive. That's right.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; So, Satan's got words.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; God uses word. Satan uses words. God
[1:09:16] said, "Of the tree of knowledge, thou
[1:09:19] shalt not eat because the day you eat
[1:09:22] thereof, you shall die." Is that right?
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, God said that. Now, he's not a
[1:09:29] threatening repeating parent. He says it
[1:09:31] one time, you believe it, you obey it.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Okay. And so, uh, Satan comes in and he
[1:09:37] changes just words. Surely you'll not
[1:09:40] die. God said, "Surely you'll die." He
[1:09:43] said, "Surely you'll not." So all
[1:09:45] Satan's got to do is start with just a
[1:09:47] little bit of your reasoning. Oh, you
[1:09:49] won't die if you, you know, so he
[1:09:52] changes.
[1:09:54] He seduces. He beguiles your mind
[1:09:59] through reasoning.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:10:02] Now, let me say say something. years ago
[1:10:05] when we were at the church on Maryland,
[1:10:08] many of you younger ones were probably
[1:10:13] either just born or whatever and you may
[1:10:15] not remember this. Barry Coffee sent me
[1:10:18] a he he actually called me on the phone.
[1:10:20] He said, "Brother Ron, are you aware of
[1:10:22] a website? I forget the name of it,
[1:10:25] Zonga or Wonga or whatever." and he
[1:10:30] said, "Uh, I think you should look on
[1:10:32] there because it's a lot of the names
[1:10:34] that are on this website of those that
[1:10:37] are friends or whatever are young people
[1:10:40] in your in your church."
[1:10:43] Wow. Well, I don't surf the internet. I
[1:10:45] don't go. He said, "Okay, he called me
[1:10:48] up. Are you on your computer?" "Yes,
[1:10:49] sir. Type in this. Go to the website www
[1:10:54] like this. Go." I opened it up. My my my
[1:11:00] message youth in my own church were
[1:11:04] sharing things on that website with one
[1:11:07] another. Here's the songs that I like
[1:11:09] best. Worldly rock and roll songs. Here
[1:11:12] are my idols. Here are my this and that.
[1:11:15] The boys sharing what their their
[1:11:17] favorite sport god was. And he was the
[1:11:20] god of uh football. The god because look
[1:11:24] and I'm going to show you the gods of
[1:11:26] this world.
[1:11:27] Brother Ram said, "Fashion can be a go."
[1:11:30] The god of fashion.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, as much as we
[1:11:36] preach holiness, we still have young
[1:11:40] girls that come to church wearing skin
[1:11:42] down wiener stuff.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; It's terrible. It's terrible. And I ask
[1:11:47] you, daddies, teach your daughters.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:53] If you let them go to school like that,
[1:11:55] I got no control of that. You let them
[1:11:58] come to church,
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; preacher,
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; then I say, "Hey, if you got guts enough
[1:12:06] to come to church and you look like you
[1:12:08] were poured into that dress,
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; then I'm gonna preach against it."
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna make you Yeah.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Not going to be easy. Is that okay with
[1:12:18] you?
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Huh? Somebody say yes, brother. Go
[1:12:21] ahead, man. You got it. Hey, look. I
[1:12:23] can't control my kids. You might as well
[1:12:25] try to.
[1:12:28] How would you like to be a teacher
[1:12:29] today? Huh? Because the parents don't
[1:12:32] control them.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Please can't control them.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; They buck every authority. So give them
[1:12:39] to the church. Give them to the Sunday
[1:12:41] school teachers. Give them to the youth
[1:12:43] leaders.
[1:12:45] You take care of them. I can't do
[1:12:47] nothing with them. Tell you what, a
[1:12:49] young person assasses back their mom and
[1:12:51] dad. It is as a spirit of rebellion,
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; sin of witchcraft
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; comes in. Yeah. You
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; h excuse me.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Do you know the only reason brother
[1:13:05] Billy Paul had problems in his life? He
[1:13:08] drank and smoked. You all know that.
[1:13:09] You've heard his life story. He he drank
[1:13:12] and smoked. Brother Brenham put up with
[1:13:14] Billy Paul going through some of these
[1:13:16] hard times. Hey, listen. This is the
[1:13:18] prophet of the hour. This is a pastor of
[1:13:21] a church and his own kids are having
[1:13:23] problems. Don't think that you're exempt
[1:13:26] from it.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Your children being raised up in church
[1:13:29] and Billy under the headship of his
[1:13:31] daddy and his daddy. I I've told you the
[1:13:34] stories about drinking and and his
[1:13:36] smoking and I don't need to I'm not
[1:13:38] going to waste the time on that. And
[1:13:41] even the time when when Billy Paul came
[1:13:43] home and told his daddy, I want to get
[1:13:45] married. Just a young boy. Daddy, I want
[1:13:48] to get married. Brother man's out
[1:13:49] washing his car. What'd he say? Oh, just
[1:13:52] go butt your head against the wall,
[1:13:54] Billy.
[1:13:56] Billy didn't take it. His dad serious.
[1:13:59] So, you know what he did?
[1:14:01] He went out and got married.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, great. Never. The girl had no
[1:14:07] permission. Neither did Billy Paul. And
[1:14:10] so now, now they're married.
[1:14:12] Okay. So, brother Brennham and the
[1:14:15] father of the girl went to the marriage
[1:14:18] and and they anulled it. Then they asked
[1:14:21] brother Brennham, "Isn't an anulment the
[1:14:23] same as divorce?" He said, "Oh my oh my,
[1:14:27] I have to go over these things." Listen,
[1:14:29] do you understand that even the
[1:14:31] prophet's own family had to he had to
[1:14:35] preach to his own family?
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody said the other day,
[1:14:38] "Well, if Mita Brandom was in a message
[1:14:40] church today, some of them would not let
[1:14:43] her go there." Wait a second. Wait a
[1:14:46] second. Wake up. You realize that his
[1:14:49] own family, he had to, as an example, if
[1:14:53] any of you knew Rebecca Smith, Brother
[1:14:55] Brennham's daughter,
[1:14:57] okay?
[1:14:59] He had to tell his own family, in fact,
[1:15:01] he called Billy and said, "Get the girls
[1:15:03] together. I've got thus sayaith the
[1:15:05] Lord."
[1:15:06] Wow.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; God, thus sayith the Lord for the girls.
[1:15:09] Got them together. He said, "How many
[1:15:10] times have I told you to not wear high
[1:15:12] heel shoes?"
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And you get rid of them,
[1:15:18] and a couple months later, you buy them
[1:15:20] again and put them in your closet. I'm
[1:15:21] going to tell you from now on, the
[1:15:23] blood's on you. I'll not tell you
[1:15:24] again."
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham had to with his own
[1:15:30] family. Okay? And let me tell you that
[1:15:34] the Brandom family is not our absolute.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; The word of God is.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; I don't care if Joseph Brandham has got
[1:15:45] a big screen TV and watches it every
[1:15:48] Sunday. Somebody asked me the other day,
[1:15:50] "Well, Brother Ron, um,
[1:15:53] people, this came to me just two days
[1:15:55] ago. Somebody texted me, "Brother Ron,
[1:15:58] people are bringing televisions back
[1:16:00] into their home because they do the same
[1:16:03] thing on their cell phone. So why not,
[1:16:05] you know, what's the difference?" Oh,
[1:16:07] let me tell you. It is not the radio. It
[1:16:11] is not the television. It is not the
[1:16:14] movies. It is not what it is. There's a
[1:16:18] spirit behind it.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham said the radio
[1:16:21] could have been mightily used of God to
[1:16:24] preach the gospel, but he said Satan
[1:16:26] come in there and perverted it.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; He said uh television could have been
[1:16:30] used of God, but he said Satan
[1:16:32] perverted. It is the misuse.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Of the cell phone and of movies and of
[1:16:38] television and stuff. And that's why he
[1:16:40] said apply the token.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Kick that trash out. It's not just a
[1:16:45] television. It's about all of these
[1:16:47] other things. Amen.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Barry Coffee, he he said,
[1:16:58] "Uh, Ron, um, you better look on this.
[1:17:02] These are kids from your own church."
[1:17:04] Oh, no, not really. No.
[1:17:08] Whoa. Was this ever a wakeup call for me
[1:17:11] as a pastor? And I said, um, so I went
[1:17:15] on to everyone and I did the little
[1:17:17] check. Make me your friend.
[1:17:22] Make me your friend so I can see the
[1:17:24] rest besides of what you got on the
[1:17:27] front page. Let me read the other pages.
[1:17:32] And while I checked them and sent it
[1:17:35] away. And while I'm at the computer, all
[1:17:38] of a sudden, block block.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; These are these are kids in my own
[1:17:48] church.
[1:17:50] Do you think I was a happy camper?
[1:17:55] Now, so the wakeup call is, hey,
[1:17:59] I do not take any of this for granted.
[1:18:01] Your kids are much smarter than you are.
[1:18:03] Parents,
[1:18:05] wake up and understand, okay? That your
[1:18:08] kids are on websites, they're on apps,
[1:18:10] that are doing things and texting and
[1:18:13] with one another and inappropriate and
[1:18:17] watching and thinking and acting and and
[1:18:20] texting and sexing and all of this. Hey,
[1:18:23] hey, hey, wake up.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Wake up. It's here. It's reality. This
[1:18:30] is the enemy. And we are not ignorant of
[1:18:32] the devil's devices, lest he take
[1:18:34] advantage of you.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I don't have a problem."
[1:18:38] Well, your kids do.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; And you need to be diligent about
[1:18:43] watching over your kids. Well, what they
[1:18:44] do in their room, it's their business.
[1:18:46] Are you kidding me? It's my home.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Anyway,
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; that was a big wakeup call. I thank
[1:18:58] brother Barry Coffee because he was a
[1:19:01] little more uh knowledgeable about
[1:19:03] websites and different things and apps
[1:19:06] and boy that was a wakeup call for me. I
[1:19:09] want all all of you to have uh parental
[1:19:13] awareness
[1:19:15] should be parental involvement.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. Parental
[1:19:21] awareness should be parental
[1:19:24] involvement.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Find out. Does your kids have you locked
[1:19:29] out of their cell phone, their computer?
[1:19:33] Huh? Do you have their password so you
[1:19:35] can go there and see what they're
[1:19:36] they're doing? Huh? What about their
[1:19:39] video games?
[1:19:41] Do they let you watch what video games
[1:19:43] they're on?
[1:19:45] Is is it conducive to creating a good
[1:19:49] atmosphere or the character of Christ in
[1:19:52] their life? Is it repeating scripture?
[1:19:56] Is that memory verses?
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; I doubt it.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Anyway,
[1:20:02] um we are in the midst of perverted
[1:20:06] laudia.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; It's darkness.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; It is a terrible time. Do you allow your
[1:20:12] children to play on the interstate out
[1:20:14] here?
[1:20:17] Do you allow them when you're doing a
[1:20:19] remodel on your house and you're fixing
[1:20:21] the electricity, you know, the
[1:20:23] electrical panel on the outside that's
[1:20:26] got all those switches, you let your
[1:20:27] kids go up there and just touch their
[1:20:29] fingers on open wiring?
[1:20:32] Do you let your kids uh go into the
[1:20:36] cabinet and drink any kind of deadly
[1:20:38] poison
[1:20:40] or do you watch over them? Because
[1:20:42] little kids, they're they're crazy.
[1:20:46] You know, my parents, my mom, and she
[1:20:48] was as strict and watching over, but she
[1:20:50] had twins. And my mother said, "I would
[1:20:53] not wish twins on my worst enemy." She
[1:20:56] said, "By the time you get one
[1:20:59] quiet and ready to go to sleep, the
[1:21:01] other one starts crying and they kicks
[1:21:04] the other one and this and that."
[1:21:06] My mother said that we got into stuff so
[1:21:08] much that she had to keep us both in the
[1:21:11] same room lest we, you know, the other
[1:21:13] one go off in the other room. My mother
[1:21:15] one time, I think it was I started
[1:21:17] crying in the back room. Um, I took the
[1:21:21] lid off Clorox and I'm drinking Clorox
[1:21:23] and I'm going
[1:21:25] and she sees a Clorox bottle. Okay. And
[1:21:28] my mother, oh my god, my son Clorox.
[1:21:30] Then my brother in the front room, he
[1:21:32] got into Drano.
[1:21:34] He was taking Drano crystals. Cleans
[1:21:36] like a white tornado.
[1:21:42] We painted when my dad left a can of
[1:21:45] black paint. He was painting something
[1:21:47] out in the garage and he left a can of
[1:21:49] black paint with a brush. Well, we got
[1:21:51] up there and hey, we turned ourselves
[1:21:54] black.
[1:21:55] Painted from head to toe.
[1:21:58] Kids will get into things. They'll do
[1:22:01] things. Why? Because they're immature.
[1:22:03] They don't know better. Your children
[1:22:05] are going to test you.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yep.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And yes, when they're little. Oh,
[1:22:12] it's so cute to watch you guys all come
[1:22:14] in with your little kids and they're so
[1:22:15] nice. Wait till they get to be
[1:22:17] teenagers.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; We'll see if you did a good job or not
[1:22:22] because they're going to test you.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Okay. Wow. This is good.
[1:22:33] You don't allow your toddlers to play
[1:22:35] outside around a swimming pool
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; with no super
[1:22:40] adult
[1:22:42] supervision.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; We had a child drown in our in our
[1:22:48] church. Remember the Ogden child?
[1:22:52] I get called to the hospital. He
[1:22:55] drowned. Been four or minutes at the
[1:22:59] bottom of the pool.
[1:23:01] The children came in to tell the mother,
[1:23:04] "Hey, hey, she's watching a movie. Don't
[1:23:08] disturb me." I said, "Stay outside and
[1:23:11] play."
[1:23:13] So the kids wanted to tell mom our
[1:23:15] brother's at the
[1:23:21] get called to the hospital
[1:23:25] and you talk and they hand me the baby,
[1:23:28] little baby that I dedicated.
[1:23:32] I hold him in my arms
[1:23:35] and the mother says, "Brother Ron, I
[1:23:37] believe you're a man of God. whatsoever
[1:23:39] you say, if you will speak life, my
[1:23:43] child shall live. And I got doctors and
[1:23:46] nurses and I'm in the emergency room and
[1:23:49] my heart is broken. I've got a lifeless
[1:23:54] young boy in my arms. You don't think
[1:23:58] that I didn't want to say, "Little son,
[1:24:01] I give you your life back in the name of
[1:24:04] Jesus." But the son can do nothing.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. except the father. And I did.
[1:24:10] I said, "God, if you'll speak the word,
[1:24:12] I don't care if there's doctors here. I
[1:24:13] don't care. Hey."
[1:24:17] And I I told the parents, "I am sorry. I
[1:24:20] am sorry. I I don't have a word. I was
[1:24:24] there when they took the little
[1:24:26] footprint as a memory. They take the
[1:24:28] little ink pad. They take the foot and
[1:24:31] they put it there and they put it on a
[1:24:33] piece of paper in memory of they like
[1:24:36] take a locket of his hair. They take his
[1:24:39] handprint. You don't think that didn't
[1:24:41] tear me up?
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; I don't want to have a a a paper in
[1:24:47] memory of
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:24:53] let
[1:24:54] that's why what I'm saying
[1:24:57] you've got to supervise.
[1:25:00] Watch your children.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; What are they playing with? Who are they
[1:25:03] hanging around with at school? Where do
[1:25:06] they get these attitudes? They go to
[1:25:07] school.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; They come home. Well, who they hanging
[1:25:10] around with? Chances are some kid, some
[1:25:13] rebel at school. They're hanging around
[1:25:16] with
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; they pick up that attitude and then they
[1:25:19] start sassing mom or dad.
[1:25:23] I tell you what, God help us.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Okay. Anyway, now
[1:25:32] Brother Brennham says, "Israel and the
[1:25:34] church, help me to go on, Lord. We've
[1:25:37] had earthquakes. We've had wars and
[1:25:39] rumors of wars. We've had tidal waves."
[1:25:41] And Jesus uh said would be the sea a
[1:25:45] roaring men's hearts failing more heart
[1:25:47] trouble number one disease fear
[1:25:50] perplexive time distress between the
[1:25:52] nations horseless carriages in the
[1:25:54] broadways speaking of old testament
[1:25:57] prophecy all these things fulfilled but
[1:25:59] the last plague is death
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; physically speaking not physically
[1:26:06] speaking but spiritually speaking death
[1:26:09] spiritually in the church you notice
[1:26:11] Notice it was amongst the son's
[1:26:14] spiritual death.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Spiritual death. So the last plague is
[1:26:21] spiritual death.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Discerning the body of the Lord.
[1:26:27] Not discerning the Lord's body. Many are
[1:26:29] weak and sickly.
[1:26:32] Many are asleep. Dead. Spiritually dead.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; The last plague that hit Egypt was
[1:26:38] death. The last plague that's hit the
[1:26:41] church is spiritual death. What we need
[1:26:43] today is spiritual awakening. A
[1:26:45] spiritual awakening to discernment.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about. Hey,
[1:26:50] wake up.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Parents, wake up. Spiritual discernment.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Start looking. Reading.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; What are your kids listening to?
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; What are they reading?
[1:27:06] Third Exodus.
[1:27:08] They killed the children with what?
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; He killed the children the first two
[1:27:14] times with natural death. The last time
[1:27:16] he's getting the children and killed
[1:27:17] them with spiritual death, marrying and
[1:27:20] intermaring.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Wow. Just exactly what they did in the
[1:27:25] book of Judges. I left you the Jebusites
[1:27:28] and all of these to see if you're going
[1:27:31] to believe the message enough that you
[1:27:33] don't marry unbelievers.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, you're getting
[1:27:41] pretty old-fashioned, man. Hey, hey,
[1:27:43] this is the 21st century. this is, you
[1:27:45] know, and and uh pretty soon you're out
[1:27:48] here and you're letting Johnny hang
[1:27:51] around this Jezebel of a girl or the
[1:27:53] girl who's raised in church, hanging
[1:27:54] around a rebel boy because he pays
[1:27:57] attention to her.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Serious.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. It's very serious. God help
[1:28:04] us to get real serious. Okay.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the areas of problematic
[1:28:12] areas, magazines,
[1:28:14] media, movies, music, cars,
[1:28:19] immorality centered around women.
[1:28:22] Immorality centered around women.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; It used to be, as a pastor I watched, it
[1:28:29] used to be, this is from firsthand
[1:28:31] experience, it used to be the young boys
[1:28:33] that were kind of dabbling and going
[1:28:35] into the world. Now it's the girls.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; The girls are having more problems than
[1:28:40] the guys.
[1:28:43] Boy, I'm not getting no amen on that.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; But it's true.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Because the girls are trying to keep up
[1:28:51] with some Jezebel in school.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Because you don't want to, you know, you
[1:28:57] just want to be accepted. You're never
[1:29:00] going to be accepted as a Christian.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Not as a true Christian. Now, if you
[1:29:06] want to be one of these uh do anything,
[1:29:09] believe anything, and feel good
[1:29:11] churches, they'll let you do and
[1:29:14] okay, but not this message. Why? Because
[1:29:17] it is a separator.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Okay, we have to understand that it's a
[1:29:21] separator. And either you will purge
[1:29:24] your own life or God will purge you.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me?
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:29:33] If do you know that the a sign of the
[1:29:35] end time is the beauty of women?
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Watch this. I read this to uh brother
[1:29:42] Steven McNeely. Uh marriage and divorce.
[1:29:46] Did you know the first destruction
[1:29:48] internationally of the world or
[1:29:50] worldwide was because of pretty women.
[1:29:58] Internationally, the world was destroyed
[1:30:01] because of pretty women.
[1:30:07] When the sons of God saw the daughters
[1:30:09] of man were fair, they taken of them
[1:30:11] women.
[1:30:13] Is that right? Have you noticed the
[1:30:14] increase of beauty of women in this day?
[1:30:17] There isn't a teenage girl. He talked
[1:30:19] about Pearl O'Brien who was the the
[1:30:21] beauty of of this day. Stephen McNeely
[1:30:24] typed in, you could Google Pearl
[1:30:26] O'Brien. Okay. could grieve
[1:30:33] and she was the beauty queen of that
[1:30:35] day. Listen to what brother Brim said.
[1:30:38] There isn't a teenage girl in this
[1:30:40] school who would outshadow her when it
[1:30:42] comes to beauty. The increase of the
[1:30:44] beauty of women is showing the time of
[1:30:47] deception.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Beauty is deceiving.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; It's vain.
[1:30:54] And the best years you have are all of
[1:30:58] our lives is up to about 20 to 25 and
[1:31:00] after that you start dying.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:31:04] Yeah. No matter how the Arnold
[1:31:07] Schwarzenegger
[1:31:09] got muscles or you know the woman, she's
[1:31:12] built like a Barbie doll, which they say
[1:31:16] is unreal.
[1:31:20] And yet that's what the girls played
[1:31:21] with was Barbie dolls and dress them and
[1:31:24] everything. It's just Satan uses all of
[1:31:27] that
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; to deceive. It's a time of deception.
[1:31:30] The beauty of women. That's why, listen,
[1:31:32] I want our girls to look nice, not too
[1:31:34] nice.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; I do. You might want to put a little
[1:31:39] tiara in them and give them a little
[1:31:41] wand and give them the high heel shoes
[1:31:43] and let them walk around the house and
[1:31:44] they think they're so cute and get them
[1:31:46] a little makeup kit and you think that's
[1:31:48] okay. That entices their spirit.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; And when you start making over them that
[1:31:54] they are the beauty queen of the they're
[1:31:56] going to start believing you and pretty
[1:31:57] soon they're going to start acting out
[1:31:58] what you're telling them.
[1:32:01] say God is not found in beauty. He's
[1:32:04] found in character.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; And beauty, he said, will be a curse to
[1:32:10] young girls in this day. And some of you
[1:32:13] are really cursed.
[1:32:15] Others, yeah. So,
[1:32:22] I don't mean to make a joke about that,
[1:32:24] but it is true. Amen.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; So the young girl who is very very
[1:32:29] pretty
[1:32:31] is going to have a hard time. Now the
[1:32:33] girl who's not so pretty has to try to
[1:32:36] pick up boys by becoming loose.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Her attraction will be that she will
[1:32:43] give of herself.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Uh
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; yeah it gets real quiet but this is
[1:32:49] true.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. God help us teach our kids. Now
[1:32:53] watch this. Uh the prophet took the
[1:32:55] sword of the spirit and he began to
[1:32:58] dissect and discern what is troubling
[1:33:01] you in your spirit realm.
[1:33:05] He called it seducing spirits, enticing
[1:33:09] spirits
[1:33:13] that come down that want to seduce you
[1:33:16] like he did Eve in the beginning. And
[1:33:20] he's going to do it through the inner
[1:33:21] course of your mind. Amen.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; And I am over you with a godly jealousy,
[1:33:27] Paul said,
[1:33:29] lest any mean by any means
[1:33:34] Satan will take advantage of you. Now,
[1:33:39] wow.
[1:33:42] Uh, Philadelphiaian church age, church
[1:33:45] age book.
[1:33:48] I'm not going to read all of it. You go
[1:33:50] home and read it. I give you these
[1:33:51] quotes. You go ahead. It's even on our
[1:33:53] website so you can look at them or read
[1:33:54] them in in the fullness. But to save
[1:33:57] time, okay, in Philadelphiaian church
[1:34:01] age. Now, we can take a note immediately
[1:34:04] that this problem of the false Jew or
[1:34:06] false believers was already in existence
[1:34:09] with the second age.
[1:34:12] These who falsely called themselves Jews
[1:34:15] appeared right after the first
[1:34:16] outpouring of the first age.
[1:34:19] And now they appear again in the second
[1:34:21] age after the reformation. This is
[1:34:24] hardly an accident.
[1:34:27] Indeed, it's not an accident. It is a
[1:34:30] principle of Satan. In other words, this
[1:34:32] is what he's going to do. Here's how he
[1:34:34] plays by the rules. He don't change.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; It's his principle.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; That principle is to organize and claim
[1:34:43] originality and therefore be entitled to
[1:34:46] special rights and privileges.
[1:34:50] Let me show you. Back there in the
[1:34:52] Sriraanian age, these people lied and
[1:34:55] said they were actually Jews or
[1:34:57] believers when they definitely were not.
[1:35:01] They were of the synagogue of Satan.
[1:35:05] They were Satan's organized crowd. For
[1:35:08] it was in that age we saw the start of
[1:35:10] men in the ministry taking unwarranted
[1:35:13] leadership over the ministering
[1:35:15] brethren. Bishops set up districts over
[1:35:18] elders. The next thing we saw that in
[1:35:22] the third age there was definitely a
[1:35:23] place called Satan's seat.
[1:35:27] We're talking among the church.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; It's happening
[1:35:32] even in the first church age. Paul said,
[1:35:37] "Oh my, you've left your first love."
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; These are people that were under the
[1:35:42] ministry of Jesus Christ, under the
[1:35:44] ministry of the disciples,
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; and yet within 40 or 50 years, you've
[1:35:50] already left your first love.
[1:35:54] I'm of Paul and I'm of Apollos and
[1:35:56] separating and dividing fellowship.
[1:36:00] My So, let's go on. I'm showing you the
[1:36:04] history of the church.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; It repeats,
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; It's cyclic or cyclic, however you say
[1:36:12] it. It's in a cycle,
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; It happened. As it was, so shall it be.
[1:36:16] As it was, so shall it be. Happening
[1:36:19] again.
[1:36:22] They were Satan's organized crowd. For
[1:36:24] it was in that age we saw that the start
[1:36:26] of men in the ministry taking an
[1:36:29] unwarranted leadership over the
[1:36:31] ministering brethren. Oh, I read that.
[1:36:33] I'm okay. Let's go down to the bottom
[1:36:35] part there.
[1:36:38] He says, "Now, of course, this synagogue
[1:36:40] group won't say they are of Satan.
[1:36:43] No, sir. They say they're of God,
[1:36:46] but they lie. For he that is a true Jew,
[1:36:50] that is what they claim to be,
[1:36:54] is one who is a Jew inwardly
[1:36:57] in the spirit. So then if they are all
[1:37:00] false Jews, it meant that they were, as
[1:37:04] Jude 19 says, having not the spirit.
[1:37:08] Children of God are born of the spirit.
[1:37:11] These have not the spirit and therefore
[1:37:14] they are not children of God. No matter
[1:37:17] how ferently
[1:37:19] they protest and to what lengths they go
[1:37:23] to try to prove that they are they are
[1:37:27] dead. Brother Brennham capitalized that.
[1:37:29] I didn't. They are dead. They are
[1:37:32] children of organization and their true
[1:37:34] fruits are missing. They are built upon
[1:37:37] their own creeds, dogmas, doctrines and
[1:37:39] the truth is not in them. For they have
[1:37:42] taken their own counselss above the word
[1:37:44] of God. That's why what I do is I try to
[1:37:47] show you
[1:37:50] bring you back to the word of God.
[1:37:51] That's what prophets do.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; They bring you back to the faith or the
[1:37:56] revelation of your fathers.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; This is not just preaching law.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; It's showing you what happened. How did
[1:38:04] it happen? How do people get away from
[1:38:06] the word of God? Why is it that so many
[1:38:08] ministers hit the ditch? Why is it so
[1:38:10] many people go away? Why is it so many
[1:38:13] people have a hard time serving God?
[1:38:16] Brother Ran preaches a sermon. Why are
[1:38:18] people so tossed about? Because they
[1:38:21] don't take the word of God as their
[1:38:22] absolute. They're not praying and
[1:38:24] reading like they should. And every one
[1:38:26] of you, whether you're old or young,
[1:38:27] realize God is not deceived. Be not
[1:38:30] mocked.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; He's not mocked.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; That whatsoever you yield yourself to,
[1:38:38] you become the servant thereof.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. either to righteousness or
[1:38:42] unrighteous. Yield to the the God of
[1:38:45] sports, the God of fashion, the God of
[1:38:46] music. You yield yourself to it and you
[1:38:49] will become the servant thereof.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Next thing you know, you'll quit going
[1:38:53] to church. The word of God is no longer
[1:38:55] uh your absolute. And pretty soon, you
[1:38:58] know, every little bit is just a little
[1:39:00] further and a little further and a
[1:39:02] little further until until How did they
[1:39:04] get way out here?
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:39:08] And the next thing you know, I'm out of
[1:39:11] here.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Don't believe it.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do? What if your
[1:39:22] parents do it? What if your parents say,
[1:39:25] "H, ain't nothing to it." You going to
[1:39:28] go also?
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; You got any revelation? Is this message
[1:39:34] revealed to you that it's Christ in him?
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. That this is Christ, the mystery
[1:39:38] of God revealed, and you're a part of
[1:39:40] it.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; But guess what? The enemy is not going
[1:39:43] to let you just
[1:39:47] sit back and have a
[1:39:50] picnic.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; You're going to fight.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; You're going to fight.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Anything worth fighting for is
[1:40:01] worth having. If
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; you don't fight for it, it ain't worth
[1:40:03] having.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; When the heads of the house allow
[1:40:13] things to be done that compromises on
[1:40:15] the word, everyone below that headship
[1:40:19] starts to compromise and it gets worse.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; So the heads of the house are going to
[1:40:26] be the ones that are responsible for
[1:40:29] those below them.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. Okay.
[1:40:33] Oh, well, I love my kids so much I just
[1:40:36] let them do what they want. Real true
[1:40:38] love is corrective.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Okay. We know that uh if the father of
[1:40:46] the household or the pastor or the
[1:40:49] prophet
[1:40:53] compromises on the word of God,
[1:40:54] everything below that compromises,
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; And it gets worse because the
[1:40:59] progression of sin
[1:41:01] Okay, let me show you in Joshua 7
[1:41:05] because here is the story of Achen.
[1:41:07] Joshua chapter 7 18- 26. And he brought
[1:41:11] his household man by man. Joshua did.
[1:41:15] And Achen the son of Carmi the son of
[1:41:17] Zebedee the son of Zerah. And then of
[1:41:20] the tribe had viewed it was taken.
[1:41:23] And Joshua said unto Achen, "My son,
[1:41:26] give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God
[1:41:28] of Israel, and make confession unto him,
[1:41:30] and tell me now what thou hast done.
[1:41:32] Hide it not from me."
[1:41:35] And Achen answered, and said, Joshua, I
[1:41:37] indeed have sinned against the Lord God
[1:41:39] of Israel, and thus and thus have I
[1:41:41] done.
[1:41:42] And when I saw among the spoils a goodly
[1:41:45] Babylonian garment
[1:41:50] and 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of
[1:41:53] gold of 50 shekels weigh. Then I coveted
[1:41:56] them and took them and behold they are
[1:41:59] hid in the earth in the midst of my tent
[1:42:03] and silver under it. So now what he
[1:42:06] thought he could do in private now
[1:42:08] affects the whole church.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:12] What am I? My brother's keeper. Come on,
[1:42:15] man.
[1:42:17] Does it really matter the life you live
[1:42:19] at home?
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Did with Achen.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Watch this. So they took Achen, verse
[1:42:32] 24. and Joshua and all the Israel with
[1:42:34] him took Achen the son of Zarah silver
[1:42:37] the garment the wedge of gold and his
[1:42:39] sons and his daughters and his oxen his
[1:42:41] asses his whole household
[1:42:45] even affected his animals
[1:42:50] and the tent all that he had brought him
[1:42:51] to the valley of Acor and Joshua said
[1:42:54] why hast thou troubled us
[1:42:57] and the Lord shall trouble thee this day
[1:42:59] and all Israel stoned him with stones
[1:43:01] and burned them with fire. And after
[1:43:04] they stoned them with with the stones,
[1:43:06] and they raised over him a great heap of
[1:43:08] stones. And to this day, so the Lord
[1:43:10] turned from the fierceness of his anger.
[1:43:13] Wherefore the name of that place is
[1:43:15] called the Valley of Acor unto this day.
[1:43:18] How many achens do we have within the
[1:43:20] message that say it really doesn't
[1:43:24] matter what I have in my tent, what I do
[1:43:27] in my home? That's my business. I beg to
[1:43:30] differ with you. Amen.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; We as a church are only as strong as our
[1:43:36] weakest link.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Your home is your castle and your
[1:43:45] fortress.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; It is a place of refuge that when you
[1:43:50] come home, you want to be able to take
[1:43:52] your shoes off. You've been fighting
[1:43:54] spirits all day, man.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; You want to be able to come home. This
[1:43:57] is my castle. This is my fortress. and
[1:44:00] in this place of my refuge and I want to
[1:44:03] be able to to rest. But if you
[1:44:06] compromise, what you've done is you've
[1:44:08] opened the door of sin
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; to your family, to your kids, and they
[1:44:13] will suffer.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Okay? You start losing battles and
[1:44:19] wondering how did this happen? I want
[1:44:21] you to take inventory.
[1:44:23] When Ahab married Jezel caused of all of
[1:44:26] Israel to go into sin and idolatry.
[1:44:30] When Constantine married papal Rome to
[1:44:33] pagome
[1:44:35] it revived the whole harlot system.
[1:44:39] And when Gerobam compromised with the
[1:44:42] word, he caused all of Israel to
[1:44:45] compromise. And the sins of Jeroboam
[1:44:49] and those that followed Jeroboam did
[1:44:51] worse. And the I've showed you before in
[1:44:54] the scripture. And they did worse in the
[1:44:57] eyes of God than their father Jerob. And
[1:45:00] they did worse because the progression
[1:45:02] of sin is worse.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; No matter what we preach at church, it's
[1:45:09] what you practice at home that counts.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brennham said, let me just
[1:45:20] give you an example. He said, "Now years
[1:45:23] ago, the ill-fade women was called a
[1:45:26] chorus girl."
[1:45:28] Then he said, "A flapper."
[1:45:31] Then he said, "A strip tease."
[1:45:35] Are you watching the progression of sin?
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Roll them, girlies, roll them. Show them
[1:45:39] your pretty knees.
[1:45:42] Showing of the knees during the Second
[1:45:44] World War was a sign of prostitution.
[1:45:47] The prostitutes sat along the road and
[1:45:49] they showed their knees.
[1:45:51] What kind of a spirit would make a woman
[1:45:53] show her needs today?
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; This is tough, isn't it?
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Ram said, "Hey,
[1:46:02] listen. Teach you mothers, teach your
[1:46:04] daughters,
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; teach them, fathers, teach your kids at
[1:46:09] home."
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:46:13] So no matter what we're preaching, if
[1:46:15] you're not under that same standard, you
[1:46:18] lower the standard and everybody below
[1:46:20] that compromises.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; So pretty soon, Junior's down on the
[1:46:25] street with his hot rod. Syis is hanging
[1:46:29] around at the cantina or the roadhouse.
[1:46:33] Look at the progression. And brother
[1:46:35] Bram said, if it goes on today, what
[1:46:37] will it be like?
[1:46:41] Why? He said it's such a modern
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; thing of immorality.
[1:46:47] It's all around. Why are people having
[1:46:49] problems sexually?
[1:46:52] Why is this an issue in the end time?
[1:46:54] Because it's a fornicating and
[1:46:57] adulterous spirit.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; That's what that's what you'll fight.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Fight some unclean spirit. trouble you,
[1:47:12] bother you.
[1:47:15] Okay,
[1:47:17] musicians have become
[1:47:21] how do evil spirits enter the home?
[1:47:26] How do they enter the church? How do
[1:47:28] they enter your children?
[1:47:31] Do you remember the young girl that
[1:47:32] brother Brennham used the example? She
[1:47:34] was raised up. She knew better.
[1:47:38] a young girl and she stopped
[1:47:41] to listen to the music.
[1:47:45] Brother Renham tells a story.
[1:47:49] He said she stopped to listen to the
[1:47:51] music. Next thing you know, she found
[1:47:53] herself out on the dance floor in the
[1:47:55] arms of a man.
[1:47:58] And he said,
[1:48:01] next thing you know, her marriage was a
[1:48:03] mess. Where did she wind up?
[1:48:06] insane institution,
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Because she just wanted to be normal.
[1:48:20] Brother Renom had to go visit her in the
[1:48:22] insane institution.
[1:48:25] He said, "I sat with her and I started
[1:48:26] to talk to her. I wanted to catch her
[1:48:29] spirit because she's
[1:48:34] You ever been in
[1:48:36] one of those institutions. You ever seen
[1:48:38] what it's like? There's three or four
[1:48:41] doors that you have to go through
[1:48:43] because they don't want the people
[1:48:45] escaping.
[1:48:48] It's not nice.
[1:48:51] When a spirit comes into the church,
[1:48:53] comes into a youth,
[1:48:56] comes into a family, what happens? How
[1:49:00] how do you know it's there? Because it
[1:49:02] brings fruits. There are fruits of a
[1:49:05] clean spirit and there are fruits of an
[1:49:06] unclean spirit. Now, the Bible says that
[1:49:09] we've got to take every thought
[1:49:12] under the obedience of the mind of
[1:49:15] Christ. Is that right?
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; We've got to take it captive.
[1:49:21] So, we fight battles. We fight it every
[1:49:24] day.
[1:49:26] I'm doing a little bit of a teaching
[1:49:28] series on this because I'm going slow
[1:49:33] and
[1:49:35] I don't want to apologize because some
[1:49:38] of you have invited friends or neighbors
[1:49:41] to the church and they want to hear me
[1:49:43] preach the gospel. Well, this is part of
[1:49:46] the gospel only teaching it. Is that
[1:49:48] okay with you?
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; It's teaching it.
[1:49:52] So, I don't apologize with what I teach
[1:49:55] because
[1:49:56] I'm speaking to the family of God.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; If they're true seed of God, it's not
[1:50:02] going to offend them.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Because brother Brennham said there was
[1:50:07] Peter inviting all his friends and
[1:50:09] neighbors and said, "Come hear Jesus of
[1:50:13] Nazareth. Maybe he's going to turn water
[1:50:15] to wine. Maybe he's going to fishes and
[1:50:18] loaves and he's going to do something
[1:50:19] and he'll discern the hearts. Behold, an
[1:50:22] Israelite in whom there is no G and
[1:50:24] everything and and and wow, he's going
[1:50:26] to do some kind of miracle. And he gets
[1:50:27] up there on that great feast day and he
[1:50:29] said, "Except you eat of my flesh and
[1:50:31] drink of my blood, you have no part with
[1:50:33] me." He said, Peter hangs his head. Oh
[1:50:36] my,
[1:50:38] why did he have to say that?
[1:50:41] Why did he say that? You know, I've been
[1:50:44] working with these people for months.
[1:50:46] Finally, they come and he says that and
[1:50:48] they look at Peter like, "Yeah, is that
[1:50:50] who you follow? I'm out of here.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. That's your Bible."
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; And it says, "And many of them were
[1:51:03] offended." Said, "This is a hard thing.
[1:51:07] It's going to get harder, saints.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; The trials are going to get tougher.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Your children are going to grow.
[1:51:15] You're going to go through things at
[1:51:16] work, in your career, in your job, in
[1:51:19] your school, and you're going to be
[1:51:21] tested.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You're going to be tested.
[1:51:24] You need to know spiritual warfare.
[1:51:27] Teach the children war.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; They need to know how do I get a spirit?
[1:51:33] How do I get a stronghold in my life?
[1:51:36] How how does it come?
[1:51:40] Brother Renham in sermon demonology he
[1:51:43] said if you open the door to a spirit
[1:51:48] and you knowing better
[1:51:50] go and open that door he says you've
[1:51:53] allowed a spirit to come in and he says
[1:51:55] now you can have the preacher and anoint
[1:51:57] you with oil and try to cast that devil
[1:51:59] out and he sits there and he he just
[1:52:01] laughs.
[1:52:03] He said, "Until." Because some demons,
[1:52:06] some demons
[1:52:08] do not come out, but by prayer
[1:52:12] and fasting.
[1:52:14] Not by the preacher,
[1:52:16] but by the person who's got it.
[1:52:20] And they say, "God, why am I always
[1:52:22] going back and over the same thing, and
[1:52:24] I repent, and I go back?" Because Jesus
[1:52:27] said, "Now go and sin no more, lest the
[1:52:30] worst thing come upon you."
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Come on. This is the scripture.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Teach your children warfare.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I'm trying to do. This
[1:52:46] is kind of boot camp.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; It is. It
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; I'm teaching. I'm real serious.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:59] If we lower the standard,
[1:53:02] the whole family will suffer.
[1:53:06] No matter how much we hold up the
[1:53:07] standard on dating unbelievers, if the
[1:53:10] parents open that door,
[1:53:13] you know, I I was preaching this up in
[1:53:15] Canada one time and I had parents
[1:53:19] that withtood me on it and said, "Well,
[1:53:22] you know, listen, I think you're too
[1:53:24] hard. We're we're we're not going to
[1:53:27] we're telling our kids different."
[1:53:30] So, they invited me to the house. They
[1:53:33] said, "We're not going to do, you know,
[1:53:35] we think this is too strict." I said,
[1:53:36] "Okay, okay." We come over, three of the
[1:53:40] girls were there, the parents,
[1:53:43] and I said, "Um,
[1:53:45] are you burning for a man?"
[1:53:49] I looked at the I asked each girl,
[1:53:54] "Are you burning for a man?"
[1:53:57] "Well, no."
[1:54:00] Oh, I said, 'Well, mama, you're saying
[1:54:04] that we shouldn't hold these standards.
[1:54:06] So, you know, uh, I want my daughters to
[1:54:09] marry young.
[1:54:14] Next thing you know,
[1:54:16] they're going to marry some guy out
[1:54:17] here, first one that comes along, and
[1:54:19] you haven't taught them correctly.
[1:54:23] So, this gets down to some real serious
[1:54:26] business.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:28] Somebody told me the other day that one
[1:54:29] even one of my grandchildren told
[1:54:32] somebody, "Well, I'm going to marry
[1:54:33] somebody." I think they were four or
[1:54:34] five years old. I'm going to marry so
[1:54:36] and so when I get older,
[1:54:38] four or five years old. Are you kidding
[1:54:40] me? Are you You know, this is kids. This
[1:54:44] is a little house play. Well, you
[1:54:46] shouldn't even be thinking about
[1:54:47] marriage at four or five, right?
[1:54:52] I mean,
[1:54:54] I got trouble and got sent to the
[1:54:56] principal's office in junior high school
[1:55:00] [Music]
[1:55:02] and in grade school cuz I kept throwing
[1:55:04] rocks at the girls.
[1:55:07] I just I Hey, they wanted to chase me
[1:55:11] and give me a kiss on the cheek during
[1:55:14] recess. I hated that. Get away.
[1:55:19] We had to do square dancing in sixth
[1:55:22] grade.
[1:55:24] Are you kidding me?
[1:55:26] Dosey-do your partner and swing your
[1:55:28] partner and all this kind. I hated it.
[1:55:31] And the girls are smiling, looking at
[1:55:32] you. Hated dancing and you know I got I
[1:55:37] did I I went to the principal's office.
[1:55:40] Wasn't until I got a little bit older
[1:55:42] and it, you know,
[1:55:45] I realized, wow,
[1:55:49] you shouldn't throw rocks at them.
[1:55:56] As I got older and I realized you, I
[1:55:59] grew up and
[1:56:02] put away childish things. I love you
[1:56:05] guys and I want to preach a truth.
[1:56:10] I do. I want you to preach that to your
[1:56:12] children.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; I want you to go back and listen to
[1:56:15] these tapes. Go back and read your
[1:56:17] Bibles.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; See, he says
[1:56:24] it's better that a man marry than to
[1:56:27] burn. Right?
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; So for the cause that it keep
[1:56:32] fornication, it's better that a man
[1:56:34] marry a woman
[1:56:36] lest he create a a problem. Okay?
[1:56:40] So
[1:56:42] but you'll find out. You think that that
[1:56:46] stops
[1:56:48] lustful thoughts after you get married.
[1:56:52] Brothers,
[1:56:56] sisters, wake up.
[1:56:59] Just because you bought the candy store
[1:57:01] doesn't mean you don't still have a
[1:57:03] sweet tooth.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; You got to keep yourself covered.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Husbands love your wives.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; As Christ loved the church, gave himself
[1:57:12] for it.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:57:15] Yes. He says, "I show you a greater
[1:57:18] mystery. I show you Christ in the
[1:57:20] church."
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Because if we're not careful, what
[1:57:22] happens? Satan comes in
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; and he comes in and he if he came
[1:57:28] against the first couple of God in God's
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Eden Amen
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; where there was no sin
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; there was no
[1:57:41] sin rampant all around it was just Satan
[1:57:43] walking him in the garden
[1:57:48] and he attacked Eve and then Paul picks
[1:57:51] it up I fear less by And he means the
[1:57:54] way that he beguiled you
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; is the way he's going to beguile you.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; God, help us to put our spiritual
[1:58:01] thinking cap on. Look around. Look at
[1:58:03] our families. Look at our children. Look
[1:58:05] at what we're letting them watch and
[1:58:08] see. And I trust that your kids, you
[1:58:11] have their password and even on their
[1:58:14] cell phone or their computer. So you can
[1:58:16] go in and say, "Hey, daddy would like to
[1:58:18] just see." Open your Facebook or
[1:58:21] Instagram or whatever these apps are
[1:58:24] that these kids have. Let me see who let
[1:58:28] me see how many friends you got.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Let me see who you allow to be your
[1:58:34] friend.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Because friendship with the world is
[1:58:38] what?
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Emnity with God.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Be careful who you call friend.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together. Praise the
[1:58:49] Lord.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Spiritual warfare in Laa.
[1:58:58] We're in it.
[1:59:01] It's hot and heavy. And he said seducers
[1:59:05] will wax worse and worse.
[1:59:08] False prophets will come.
[1:59:11] They will do all of these things. And he
[1:59:14] said, "Wake up. We're here. This is end
[1:59:17] times.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; And he says, one of the signs of this
[1:59:22] end time that we're in the midst of it
[1:59:23] is the beauty of women.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; And he said, just as what happened then,
[1:59:29] it's happening again today. God, help us
[1:59:32] to teach our little girls to have
[1:59:34] character and not so much on beauty.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father, as we have spoke
[1:59:39] these words tonight to your people, and
[1:59:41] they're my people. I'm not trying to do
[1:59:43] this on the internet. I'm not trying to
[1:59:45] get others to listen to me. No. The only
[1:59:48] reason I even allow these services to be
[1:59:51] archived is for the sake of my church.
[1:59:54] I'm not interested in trying to correct
[1:59:56] other churches and what they do in other
[1:59:58] pastors. They're sovereign within
[2:00:00] themselves. I'm not trying to do that,
[2:00:02] Father. But I'm trying to be a go a good
[2:00:05] godly shepherd over the sheep that you
[2:00:07] have given here under our leadership.
[2:00:10] doing all that I can to try to keep the
[2:00:12] enemy, false
[2:00:15] shepherds and ravenous wolves and
[2:00:17] different things that come in to try to
[2:00:19] destroy the sheep. Father, I thank you.
[2:00:22] I praise you. I pray take what broken up
[2:00:25] sermon that I've preached tonight and
[2:00:27] bless it to the hearts of your people.
[2:00:29] Let them understand, Father, that we
[2:00:31] have the flashing red lights of the
[2:00:32] signs of your coming. You're coming
[2:00:35] soon. May we all be ready and have our
[2:00:39] lives in order and our life in order
[2:00:43] that we could walk in a way that's
[2:00:45] pleasing to you because by without faith
[2:00:48] it's impossible to please you. Father, I
[2:00:51] thank you. I praise you. Take this
[2:00:53] sermon now and use it for your glory in
[2:00:55] Jesus Christ's name.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, turn
[2:01:01] your eyes
[2:01:03] upon Jes.
[2:01:09] Look for
[2:01:12] in his wonderful
[2:01:15] o
[2:01:20] and the things
[2:01:22] of the earth
[2:01:25] will grow straight
[2:01:28] in
[2:01:31] the light
[2:01:33] of his glory.
[2:01:39] Yes. Turn your eyes.
[2:01:42] Turn
[2:01:44] your eyes
[2:01:46] on.
[2:01:47] [Music]
[2:01:51] looked for
[2:01:54] in his wonderful
[2:01:57] face
[2:02:01] and the things
[2:02:04] of the earth
[2:02:06] will grow straight
[2:02:10] in
[2:02:12] the light
[2:02:14] of his glory
[2:02:18] and grace.
[2:02:20] Brother Chris Clayville, come up here,
[2:02:22] my brother.
[2:02:30] It's good to have you here tonight.
[2:02:32] See you once again, your family.
[2:02:37] Amen. Come up here. I want you to
[2:02:39] dismiss in a word of prayer. Let me hug
