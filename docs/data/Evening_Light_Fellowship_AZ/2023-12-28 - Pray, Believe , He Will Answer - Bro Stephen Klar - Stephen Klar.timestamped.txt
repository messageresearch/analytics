[36:30] there just moaning and groaning and uh
[36:35] uh everything but you know there's
[36:37] something about it when you got a when
[36:38] you got somebody that's been on the team
[36:40] for a while and he seeson veteran he
[36:42] gets hurt what he does is he goes to the
[36:45] sideline he has to rehab for a while
[36:47] yeah he's he's got a rehab then as he
[36:49] starts feeling better he comes to the

[49:19] this evening amen praise the
[49:22] Lord amen I I feel inspired today to
[49:26] speak to
[49:28] you last time I came and brother Ron
[49:31] allowed me to speak I I have to confess
[49:34] I was very
[49:35] nervous Amen to have a man of God is
[49:38] such of his caliber to sit behind me and
[49:42] but today I I thank the Lord because I I
[49:44] feel comfortable in the house of God
[49:47] with you
[49:48] today to speak words of life and I I
[49:51] pray that I could just be
[49:53] myself I feel my heart you know I I as I
[49:57] prayed I I I just moments ago I asked
[50:01] the Lord as brother Ron invited I asked
[50:03] him Lord what would you like to speak
[50:05] and my heart was exp excited to to speak
[50:08] a message that greater than all the
[50:10] prophets are here and I wanted to run
[50:12] down the line and tell you the Lord
[50:14] Jesus is I was excited but last Thursday
[50:18] little The Voice you know the Lord
[50:19] speaks to our heart and last Thursday
[50:22] the Lord spoke to me and said they know
[50:24] I'm here
[50:26] but they need to know that I need to be
[50:28] called
[50:31] upon we need to call upon Him many times
[50:35] we think about prayer and we understand
[50:37] that we ought to pray and I I like to
[50:41] start off with a quotation from the
[50:43] prophet and lifting him out of history
[50:46] in
[50:47] 1958 the prophet would say he's a
[50:50] historical God and a present day God am
[50:54] we're not looking in the rear re mirr
[50:57] now today and looking back at history no
[51:00] we're we're looking what God is doing
[51:02] present time present moments right here
[51:05] in the building tonight the prophet of
[51:08] God would say he's waiting to be called
[51:12] upon are you willing to call upon the
[51:15] Lord even in this service if you had a
[51:18] need in your heart if you had something
[51:20] that is burdening you today are you
[51:23] willing to pause for that moment in his
[51:25] presence and call the everpresent God on
[51:29] the scene and say Lord I have sickness
[51:31] in my body but you can be my
[51:34] healer Lord I I have an unconfessed sin
[51:37] today Lord but you can take what was
[51:40] just wrong you can take that was sinful
[51:43] that which is full of unbelief and you
[51:45] can turn it around
[51:47] tonight he's waiting to be called
[51:51] upon call upon the Lord he heal will
[51:55] hear you speak to him in Psalm pray to
[52:00] him believe him and he'll
[52:04] answer those words
[52:08] pray believe and he will answer has
[52:12] stuck into my
[52:14] heart how many tonight will agree with
[52:18] me how with me will agree with me
[52:20] tonight and know that prayer is a
[52:24] struggle that is it's really hard to
[52:26] pray you know many times I I I I I've
[52:29] gone on my knees and I'm a lot like
[52:31] maybe all of
[52:33] you and I've got down on my knees and I
[52:36] begin to pray and as I'm praying you
[52:39] know I you have the struggles that go on
[52:42] the Mind battles the the things that put
[52:45] Satan puts in your way and you're the
[52:48] heavens they feel like
[52:51] brass you know I I I've told my wife and
[52:54] my wife knows she she said I don't like
[52:56] cleaning the car how many how many likes
[52:58] to clean their car but you know
[53:01] something as I as I'm praying I'm even
[53:04] thinking about how wonderful it would be
[53:06] to clean my
[53:08] car oh
[53:11] my you know I I get thinking about all
[53:14] the burdens that we have at church and I
[53:17] and all the struggle all those things
[53:19] and because the there's a great battle
[53:21] that's going on there's a great
[53:23] struggle but regardless of the struggle
[53:26] there's an absolute necessity that the
[53:30] believer gets down into
[53:34] prayer right I want to ask you this if I
[53:38] if I had the ability and I and I don't
[53:40] if you see on my bank account you'd
[53:42] recognize that I don't have this ability
[53:44] but if I had the ability tonight to
[53:47] share with you how that you all could
[53:50] become
[53:51] millionaires in a short amount of time
[53:55] you would all sit together and you would
[53:58] all think you know I want to listen to
[54:01] Brother Steve I you know he's a he
[54:03] possibly is got that kind of Finance you
[54:06] kind of kind of money maybe I could
[54:08] learn something from him and you'd all
[54:10] have your your
[54:12] notepads in order to find out what is
[54:15] the key to
[54:18] success what is it that's going to make
[54:20] me as a
[54:23] millionaire well tonight brother I got
[54:25] something to tell you that's beyond the
[54:28] na the natural millions that you can
[54:31] make in this
[54:33] life I want to tell you through the
[54:35] voice of a
[54:37] prophet if it was just me tonight
[54:40] telling you this is the success this is
[54:43] how to become successful in your
[54:46] spiritual
[54:48] life you could take it or leave it but
[54:51] the prophet of God tells us today he
[54:55] says the fellowship the key to success
[54:58] the key today is something
[55:02] simple but it's
[55:05] prayer the very thing that we struggle
[55:08] over amen the very simplest thing now if
[55:12] I if I would tell you some great uh uh
[55:16] uh thing to do that was difficult I'm
[55:18] sure all of us today would have written
[55:20] it down and went outside the door and we
[55:23] would have pushed forward we want to do
[55:25] this Great Mighty thing but when it's a
[55:28] very simple remedy it's something very
[55:31] simple that all of us can
[55:33] do friends we let it slip our
[55:37] minds we take to other things we we let
[55:40] other things get in the way and brother
[55:43] Brandon would say in 1950 in the mess's
[55:47] expectation he would said that's the
[55:49] secret of all mysteries of
[55:54] God
[55:55] you can read it there for
[55:57] yourself that's the key that opens the
[56:00] door to everything of God is
[56:06] prayer beautiful beauti the key to your
[56:10] success as a spiritual
[56:13] believer to be able to to have this
[56:17] quality of fellowship with God is to get
[56:20] into that place with Jesus
[56:23] Christ where him and you are on that
[56:26] level of husband and wife that intimate
[56:30] relationship I'm not just speaking to
[56:33] you you need to be just a friend of God
[56:35] or a girlfriend of God I I'm talking to
[56:38] the Lamb's wife tonight amen that's who
[56:42] you are tonight and brother Brandon
[56:44] would say in the message the key to the
[56:46] door you know I key that Lo locks and
[56:50] unlocks true can you see that you know a
[56:54] key that locks unlocks too see you can
[56:58] uh uh loose or bind that's right the
[57:01] same key that
[57:05] locks
[57:08] unlocks we know that brother brand would
[57:10] say Prayer Changes Things Are prayer is
[57:12] the greatest you know Atomic weapon that
[57:16] there
[57:17] is but in this building tonight as
[57:20] Believers being the Lamb's wife do you
[57:23] believe that tonight
[57:25] right you have the authority under your
[57:28] adoption tonight to speak the word of
[57:32] God and what you speak is God
[57:37] speaking what you bind it's God's bind
[57:41] what un you unlock is God
[57:47] unlocking but we missed this whole
[57:49] principle that the prophet is giving to
[57:52] us and we let it slip by us so
[57:56] easily maybe let me run down a a moment
[57:59] of your day or I'm going to be just
[58:00] really open with you I I'm going to give
[58:02] you a heart to heart today amen
[58:05] sometimes the beginning of our mornings

[58:46] fellowship we we tend to have these
[58:49] mornings we tend to rush and and leave
[58:52] our lord Jesus so to speak speak in the
[58:56] dust and then you know by midday it we
[59:00] we find ourselves that we are a little
[59:02] bit uh hungry and we find ourselves at
[59:05] the
[59:06] cafeteria or find ourselves somewhere
[59:09] and you know man the place is packed out
[59:12] how many's ever been there the coffee
[59:15] room is packed out the place is packed
[59:17] out I'm just preaching ordinary to you
[59:19] I'm just an ordinary
[59:20] guy the the C everything's full I used
[59:23] to work in the operating room and we'd
[59:25] go and the and the and the lunchroom was
[59:27] full of doctors and nurses and people
[59:30] that thought a lot of themselves and and
[59:33] we would sit in there and sudden you
[59:36] look around and you think well Lord It's
[59:39] a I'm thankful for this
[59:41] lunch we do the little facial swipe as
[59:45] we pray God we're so thankful for we're
[59:48] just thankful for the food that was on
[59:50] our
[59:51] table and Lord I I don't want to to make
[59:54] my my colleagues feel awkward that's why
[59:58] I won't make a long drawn up prayer they
[1:00:00] they'll all feel awkward when really in
[1:00:03] our lives friends he's the first part he
[1:00:06] he's the the the reason that we we're
[1:00:11] alive he's the reason that we're here as
[1:00:16] we just heard we we did not choose him
[1:00:18] the message did we didn't choose the
[1:00:20] message but the message chose
[1:00:23] us
[1:00:26] then you get to a
[1:00:28] time I and yes I'm trying to be a little
[1:00:31] bit comical so that you stay with me for
[1:00:33] just a
[1:00:34] moment but but we're all the
[1:00:39] same you know many times uh we stand
[1:00:42] here in the pulpit and you would think
[1:00:44] nothing goes wrong in a Minister's life
[1:00:45] or everything is
[1:00:47] amazing but we go through the same
[1:00:50] burdens the same struggles the same mind
[1:00:54] battles that you would all go through so
[1:00:57] you come home from work and how many's
[1:00:59] with me tonight comes home and they're
[1:01:01] tired you you strived you've been around
[1:01:04] people and you know you you just
[1:01:07] struggle in the door the wife Pats you
[1:01:09] on the back just to little and welcomes
[1:01:11] you home and you just don't want to go
[1:01:14] you don't want to do anything
[1:01:16] else so now it's time for bed and you
[1:01:20] invite the Lord over to your bedside and
[1:01:22] you crawl under your covers and pull the
[1:01:24] little sheets up nice high and you say
[1:01:26] Lord we're going to have a conversation
[1:01:28] now well I'm relaxing you know what
[1:01:30] happens to me it's 30 seconds and I am s
[1:01:34] lber
[1:01:35] Lumber I am sleep you see this is how
[1:01:39] human life
[1:01:42] is you see the Christian Life prayer
[1:01:46] friends the fellowship with the Lord
[1:01:49] should just be like our natural
[1:01:52] breathing you don't have to think about
[1:01:55] breathing how many of you any any of you
[1:01:58] here this evening just now thought about
[1:02:01] breathing uh brother
[1:02:03] Ron man I I should never asked that
[1:02:05] question in in a room where the pastor
[1:02:09] is
[1:02:13] healing but most of us tonight have not
[1:02:16] thought about our breathing right you
[1:02:20] didn't have to force yourself to breathe
[1:02:23] you know prayer shouldn't it should be a
[1:02:26] normal response to a Believer yes
[1:02:30] absolutely fellowship with the
[1:02:32] Lord should be
[1:02:35] spontaneous it has not to be worked up
[1:02:38] it's not somebody to tell you you need
[1:02:40] to pray or your wife your husband or a
[1:02:43] friend or the pastor or the song
[1:02:44] Ministry shouldn't have to get you the
[1:02:47] place no let's pray let's pray it should
[1:02:49] be like breath
[1:02:52] spontaneous before the Lord
[1:02:55] did you know that yes you did but did
[1:02:57] you know that any interruptions of
[1:02:59] breath can come and you get to have a a
[1:03:02] medical emergency where maybe your heart
[1:03:04] or your lungs or other part of your body
[1:03:07] might suffer quite just a little
[1:03:10] bit you know brother random would preach
[1:03:12] a message about spiritual
[1:03:14] Amnesia but but I want to bring this
[1:03:17] forward to you in a thought that
[1:03:19] sometimes we have spiritual sleep
[1:03:23] apnea does everybody know what sleep
[1:03:25] apne is it's when you forget to breathe
[1:03:28] while you're
[1:03:29] sleeping and many times we as a Believer
[1:03:33] we come into this place
[1:03:36] where we just forget in our
[1:03:40] heaviness in our intoxication of this
[1:03:45] life our our our busy duties with our
[1:03:48] children raising our children we raised
[1:03:50] three children and my wife was very busy
[1:03:52] day in day out especially as as they
[1:03:54] were little
[1:03:55] growing and many times you know the
[1:03:58] fellowship with the Lord maybe wasn't
[1:04:00] there as it ought to be both man and
[1:04:02] wife because of
[1:04:04] busyness but the expectation of the Lord
[1:04:07] the key to success we now realize is
[1:04:10] prayer it is that key but let us not
[1:04:14] allow the intoxications of this world to
[1:04:18] bind us up for long periods of time
[1:04:21] because when we're bound up and we are
[1:04:24] ing ourselves without breath our
[1:04:27] spiritual lives are
[1:04:33] deteriorating with natural sleep AP you
[1:04:37] you come to a place where you forget to
[1:04:39] breathe while you're sleeping for a span
[1:04:41] of time but then before you note your
[1:04:43] body kicks in and it says to you if you
[1:04:46] don't breathe now you're going to
[1:04:49] die and suddenly you take
[1:04:53] this gasp of breath it's it's
[1:04:57] horrible and when you take that gasp
[1:04:59] your body responds and it comes back to
[1:05:03] life I find many times our spiritual
[1:05:06] lives are just that way we fall asleep
[1:05:09] and we get intoxicated we get under
[1:05:12] under under struggles and thoughts and
[1:05:15] and before you know we we have got to a
[1:05:17] place where we've spiritually stop
[1:05:19] breathing but something of trauma comes
[1:05:22] into our life and something way it
[1:05:24] happens that our minds come to
[1:05:26] remembrance oh God is still
[1:05:30] present and we do as we would
[1:05:33] gasp and we begin to
[1:05:36] pray But as time progresses and your
[1:05:40] normal breathing comes into play our
[1:05:43] humanness sets us back into Old bad
[1:05:47] habits and once again we forget the key
[1:05:50] to
[1:05:52] success and we forget that God is
[1:05:54] calling us to worship
[1:05:57] Him brother Bram would say this and he's
[1:06:00] speaking this message I am the
[1:06:02] resurrection and the life he's speaking
[1:06:05] this of Lazarus and you know who had no
[1:06:08] no Breath of Life in him he had died and
[1:06:10] brother bradam says like this and as
[1:06:12] soon as Jesus left the
[1:06:15] home sickness set in sorrow set in and
[1:06:19] listen Christians when Jesus leaves your
[1:06:23] home sickness and trouble will set right
[1:06:27] in behind
[1:06:29] it when he leaves your home get ready
[1:06:34] for
[1:06:35] trouble cuz it's on the road right
[1:06:40] then when we leave
[1:06:43] Jesus there is
[1:06:46] troubles I want to remind you Mary and
[1:06:49] Joseph they brought Jesus in and as they
[1:06:53] were traveling and they were going to do
[1:06:55] the there to Jerusalem what did they do
[1:06:56] they forgot Jesus on the way home yeah
[1:07:00] yeah the very ones that were caretakers
[1:07:03] of the of God himself on here on Earth
[1:07:06] as a little boy
[1:07:08] yeah they left him and they went on
[1:07:11] their Road for three days journey how
[1:07:14] did somebody ever do
[1:07:17] that you know I don't know a lot of you
[1:07:19] but maybe brother Steve mcney how about
[1:07:22] you lose where is he tonight how about
[1:07:24] you for there he is how about you and
[1:07:26] your wife forgetting your child
[1:07:29] someplace I mean it seems unheard of
[1:07:33] brother
[1:07:34] Robert but they left
[1:07:37] Jesus and how is it that you and I
[1:07:40] running this everyday life we too many
[1:07:43] times leave Jesus behind I want to
[1:07:45] encourage you tonight if there's any
[1:07:47] Ministry within me to give to you
[1:07:49] tonight I'm encouraging don't leave
[1:07:52] Jesus behind
[1:07:55] amen Fellowship I want to tell you takes
[1:07:59] relationship in order to have a good
[1:08:01] relationship with your spouse or with
[1:08:04] your friend you must build a
[1:08:09] relationship you must work at a
[1:08:11] relationship so relationships now I'm
[1:08:14] not just talking naturally now I'm
[1:08:15] talking about spiritually having a
[1:08:17] relationship with our lord Jesus it
[1:08:20] takes a lot of discipline a lot to work
[1:08:25] amen now making the relationship is easy
[1:08:27] but keeping the relationship is very
[1:08:32] difficult in order to have a a
[1:08:34] relationship with the Lord Jesus it's
[1:08:36] going to take energy energy to have a
[1:08:40] relationship with our Lord Jesus it's
[1:08:43] going to take a very unselfish
[1:08:46] act brother Brandon would say on this
[1:08:48] day of Calvary he would say look what
[1:08:51] Jesus turned and said in so much
[1:08:54] as you have done unto these you did it
[1:08:57] unto me
[1:09:00] unselfish
[1:09:01] life you don't give it a second thought
[1:09:04] your your thoughts are upon Christ
[1:09:06] you're not caring about your workout
[1:09:08] schedule you're not caring about your
[1:09:10] your eating schedule or what you need to
[1:09:13] do at Starbucks or buying the no your
[1:09:15] thoughts are Upon Jesus
[1:09:19] Christ the scripture would tell us in
[1:09:21] Romans chap 12:1 one he would say take
[1:09:26] my
[1:09:28] life a living
[1:09:31] sacrifice the furtherance of the
[1:09:33] scripture says take my life a living s
[1:09:36] which is holy and acceptable unto God
[1:09:39] which is my reasonable service yes amen
[1:09:43] it's not
[1:09:44] unreasonable the Lord doesn't find it
[1:09:47] unreasonable for you to lay yourself
[1:09:50] unselfishly down upon the altar yeah and
[1:09:54] Gifts God's gifts always find their
[1:09:58] places here again he says worship
[1:10:02] him then present your gift present your
[1:10:06] body as a Living Sacrifice holy and
[1:10:10] accept it present yourself you are the
[1:10:14] gift you are the one that God receives
[1:10:17] you are the gift to
[1:10:20] God we as the bride have presented
[1:10:23] ourselves unto our Lord Jesus
[1:10:26] Christ and she has opened her heart to
[1:10:33] him tonight have you opened your heart
[1:10:35] to
[1:10:38] Jesus is it that you just come to a
[1:10:41] service to put in
[1:10:43] time or is it you've come because you
[1:10:46] desired to have your heart wide open to
[1:10:49] to receive the Lord
[1:10:52] Jesus the Lord Jesus doesn't want you to
[1:10:55] have closed doors tonight or he wants
[1:10:57] you to open your door he wants you to
[1:11:00] open every room of your house before
[1:11:05] him every door brother rer preaches a
[1:11:08] whole message of doors within a door
[1:11:10] doors and he tells us open every door in
[1:11:14] your
[1:11:15] life friends we got to sweep out all of
[1:11:18] our all of our unnecessary things out of
[1:11:21] our
[1:11:22] lives
[1:11:24] you know
[1:11:25] uh I apologize for using our example
[1:11:28] home examp examples a lot but you know
[1:11:30] sometimes how many's ever done some uh
[1:11:33] uh spring cleaning
[1:11:36] sometime and uh you do real well and I I
[1:11:39] got my wife she's a wonderful house uh
[1:11:42] clean and she keeps Everything clean she
[1:11:45] she's just so good but you know when
[1:11:47] spring time comes around and she says uh
[1:11:50] Steve we we we got to pull away the
[1:11:52] furniture
[1:11:54] right and you pull away the furniture
[1:11:56] and you move things around all of a
[1:11:58] sudden in the corners of the room are
[1:12:01] all kinds of these dust what we call
[1:12:03] dust
[1:12:04] bunnies come on I mean you're all
[1:12:07] looking at me like this never
[1:12:10] happens all right it just happens at my
[1:12:12] house praise
[1:12:14] God but there's all kinds of little dust
[1:12:18] bunnies how did they get
[1:12:20] there I thought we were such clean and
[1:12:22] organized people people how did they get
[1:12:24] there it's like that in our personal
[1:12:28] lives we come to church we read our
[1:12:31] Bibles we do the things that are
[1:12:33] expected of us we look as though we're
[1:12:35] clean and holy and acceptable to God
[1:12:37] which is our reasonable service but when
[1:12:40] you pull away the furniture sometimes
[1:12:43] and you open the door God begins to
[1:12:45] shine his light upon the corners of your
[1:12:49] household suddenly you begin to
[1:12:51] recognize that maybe there are some dust
[1:12:54] bunnies
[1:12:56] there that you know we're not talking
[1:12:59] about gross sins we're not talking about
[1:13:01] lost and fornication things and stealing
[1:13:04] no and smoking no we're talking about
[1:13:06] little things and brother Brown would
[1:13:08] tell us I believe it's in the the
[1:13:10] message of super sign that's the little
[1:13:13] things that get us it's the little
[1:13:15] things that spoil your Vine it's the
[1:13:19] little things that cut off your
[1:13:20] communication with God it's the little
[1:13:23] things things friends tonight that ruin
[1:13:26] your
[1:13:28] [Applause]
[1:13:29] success as a believer in Jesus
[1:13:33] Christ brother Brandy describes to us
[1:13:36] that our hearts our Our Lives ought to
[1:13:39] be like a three- room
[1:13:42] house and in our three- room house we we
[1:13:45] would we would have the the entrance of
[1:13:48] the kitchen and and it's typed there in
[1:13:51] into the outer court and inner Court and
[1:13:53] the holies of
[1:13:55] holies and all in this we see that we
[1:13:59] need to give our entire beings to God
[1:14:01] which SS to you and I that our bodies
[1:14:05] are unto
[1:14:07] Christ our
[1:14:09] spirit belongs to
[1:14:12] Christ Our soul is his throne
[1:14:16] room it's his control tower but Satan
[1:14:20] will make our human makeup to to fight
[1:14:23] against the very one that should enter
[1:14:26] into the realm of our body spirit and
[1:14:29] soul friends I believe that God controls
[1:14:31] all of our
[1:14:33] Lives year ago year ago years ago
[1:14:36] friends I I buried this old
[1:14:39] man years ago I laid him down into the
[1:14:43] grave and I said you're no longer wanted
[1:14:46] old man you're no longer wanted I want
[1:14:49] to have the mind of Jesus Christ I want
[1:14:52] the mind of Christ to come in my being
[1:14:54] and take care control of my body I want
[1:14:57] the mind of God to take care of my
[1:15:00] spirit faculties when the mind of God
[1:15:03] takes care of our spir hallelujah our
[1:15:05] spiritual facities we don't have to
[1:15:07] worry about these anxieties and
[1:15:11] depressions and things that so beset us
[1:15:14] in this
[1:15:15] hour the greatest battle that's
[1:15:18] happening right now is in our minds
[1:15:21] Satan D desires destroy your mind get
[1:15:25] you thinking on other things when God is
[1:15:27] saying I want you to think on
[1:15:29] me I want you to Fellowship about on me
[1:15:33] I want you to call upon
[1:15:39] me brother brandham speaks this in the
[1:15:42] message life of demons and Visions in
[1:15:45] 1951 he
[1:15:48] says and he's talking about how we're
[1:15:51] having these battles and how that our
[1:15:53] bodies we have struggles in our bodies
[1:15:55] to pray he says I went over there and
[1:15:57] not down do you ever feel like you know
[1:16:00] the the Bri uh briers stuck you and and
[1:16:05] the Flor was too
[1:16:06] hard did you ever have
[1:16:09] that that's the time to press
[1:16:15] on that's the devil trying to keep you
[1:16:18] from it move right
[1:16:21] on I just said thank you Lord and I kept
[1:16:24] on praying and after a while I got lost
[1:16:28] in the spirit once you're lost in his
[1:16:33] presence your life will declare Christ
[1:16:38] Sevenfold brother Brandon would tell us
[1:16:40] he would say you know if you take a
[1:16:42] triangle piece of glass and and you
[1:16:46] would you know you would shine a light
[1:16:48] on that glass well when the three parts
[1:16:51] meet he would say there there one place
[1:16:53] that you you would pass the light
[1:16:54] through and out from that light would
[1:16:56] come seven different
[1:16:58] colors and begin to speak that they were
[1:17:01] the seven colors of
[1:17:03] God knowing that the colors of God they
[1:17:07] symbolize Divine
[1:17:09] connection and when you are in
[1:17:11] fellowship with God your life will
[1:17:16] Sparkle when you you know your body is
[1:17:18] that Triune being Body Spirit and soul
[1:17:22] and when the light of his
[1:17:24] word when the light of his presence
[1:17:28] begins to shine shine upon your being
[1:17:31] you cannot but Sparkle the word you
[1:17:33] cannot but prophesy again your life
[1:17:37] begins to
[1:17:40] speak we could show forth in the Old
[1:17:42] Testament how the urum Thum would be
[1:17:44] there and they would speak a word to the
[1:17:46] urum Thum or some sort of word they felt
[1:17:49] was from the Lord and if it came from
[1:17:51] the Lord the the co the the the stones
[1:17:54] on the Yum Thum will begin to
[1:17:57] Sparkle and we know the word of God is
[1:18:00] is that yum Thum and and as our lives
[1:18:03] friends are presented unto the word and
[1:18:06] the word shines in our lives the seven
[1:18:09] colors the beauty of God begins to shine

[1:22:51] gladness The Voice of
[1:22:53] Praise yes sir this is what the people
[1:22:56] of God do and pray we're not in a
[1:22:58] morning celebration where we say well we
[1:23:00] got a priest we pray without ceasing and
[1:23:02] how and we get it no there's a joy in
[1:23:05] our hearts we're meeting with the King
[1:23:06] of Kings the Lord of lords he is your
[1:23:09] heavenly
[1:23:11] husband
[1:23:16] absolutely when a husband and wife are
[1:23:18] married they enjoy seeing one
[1:23:21] another and if you don't feel that
[1:23:23] expression towards one another we'd like
[1:23:26] to pray with you after the
[1:23:29] service but you know something people go
[1:23:31] cold in their relationships this is free
[1:23:34] the people go cold in their
[1:23:37] relationships why is it because they
[1:23:39] don't take time and the energy and the
[1:23:41] work it takes to make an a a
[1:23:46] lifelong joy in their
[1:23:49] marriage they just want momentary
[1:23:51] weekend satisfac
[1:23:53] action but God is calling to us as a
[1:23:56] wife I'm not interested in we can moment
[1:23:59] satisfaction I'm here for everyday
[1:24:03] praise I'm here for prayerful
[1:24:07] Fellowship you know Joy is a is a is a
[1:24:10] Divine
[1:24:12] Dimension to have real joy you must be
[1:24:16] locked into Christ and many times when
[1:24:19] we say the word joy we think about the
[1:24:21] joy that we just had at
[1:24:23] Christmas and we think about the joy
[1:24:25] that we would had in our birthday party
[1:24:27] or the joy that when we we just have a a
[1:24:30] human expression of Joy but joy is
[1:24:33] divine it's much deeper than any human
[1:24:37] expression that's right Joy is not
[1:24:40] Shackled by human
[1:24:43] circumstances Joy isn't the same as
[1:24:46] happiness happiness depends on
[1:24:50] circumstances but joy is the
[1:24:53] strength that Cometh From The
[1:24:58] Lord you know the the Hebrew word which
[1:25:00] I cannot pronounce but it means to LEAP
[1:25:03] or to spin around in pleasure the joy of
[1:25:06] the word gets in your being and you
[1:25:09] cannot help but
[1:25:11] rejoice it reminds me of the little
[1:25:13] example brother brandham gives about
[1:25:14] that little little creek or stream or
[1:25:16] however it was and and and the question
[1:25:19] was asked little little stream why why
[1:25:22] are you so happy spring little spring
[1:25:25] thank you brother what why are you so
[1:25:27] happy is it because a little rabbit
[1:25:29] comes or drink or is it cuz I come drink
[1:25:32] no he says because something is
[1:25:35] pushing I see tonight there's a lot of
[1:25:38] people that have some pushing something
[1:25:40] on the inside Christ on the inside
[1:25:43] pushing within our beings it is that joy
[1:25:46] that Divine Joy that's with inside of us
[1:25:49] amen beautiful this peace of God it ra
[1:25:52] radiates
[1:25:53] peace with a prayer life and with God
[1:25:57] moving and God having that relationship
[1:25:59] as you should have with him you begin to
[1:26:02] have peace in your
[1:26:04] life I want to tell you like this
[1:26:07] without the contact of God worries set
[1:26:09] in
[1:26:11] yes without contact of God fears set
[1:26:16] in anxieties set in and they begin to
[1:26:21] overtake us
[1:26:23] right when Jesus he's come and he's
[1:26:27] spoken into into our lives not just
[1:26:29] around our lives but into our lives
[1:26:32] peace be
[1:26:35] still a lot of us have got worries in
[1:26:38] our life and we and and listen worries
[1:26:41] is kind of like a rocking
[1:26:43] chair you get into that rocking chair
[1:26:46] and it gives you something to do but you
[1:26:49] never go
[1:26:51] anywhere
[1:26:53] for Ron do you have a rocking chair I
[1:26:55] think this last week he rocked and went
[1:27:01] nowhere that's what worry is
[1:27:04] like sometimes worry is and fear they're
[1:27:08] Illustrated like water it begins to
[1:27:11] trick in a small trickle of
[1:27:14] doubt that creeps into your mind it all
[1:27:17] starts in your
[1:27:19] mind and and if it's if it's not stop it
[1:27:23] still soon becomes a stream of
[1:27:26] fear which creates a pond of paranoia
[1:27:31] yeah which begins to overflow and makes
[1:27:33] a river of
[1:27:35] distress and then it develops in your
[1:27:38] own raging torrent of
[1:27:42] tension and before you know it now this
[1:27:44] is for you because I came to Arizona
[1:27:47] before you know it it's caused a Grand
[1:27:50] Canyon to be car D in your
[1:27:54] life it's a deep Canyon before you know
[1:27:58] you don't know what to do with it it's
[1:27:59] anxiety and that's why we have so many
[1:28:02] young people wanting to take their lives
[1:28:03] even in the message it should never be
[1:28:06] heard of it why because we're creating
[1:28:09] an atmosphere where they can jump and
[1:28:10] move but they never get into
[1:28:16] prayer they come to the Altar and we
[1:28:19] shout at them we shout at them lots of
[1:28:20] noise lots of noise but they never get
[1:28:22] to
[1:28:23] pray sometimes there needs to be some
[1:28:26] quietness where we even tell the
[1:28:28] musicians just tone it down just a
[1:28:30] little bit you on the guitars you on the
[1:28:32] drums just tone it down just a there's a
[1:28:35] birth that's going to happen
[1:28:36] [Music]
[1:28:38] here listen in a birthing room you don't
[1:28:41] want all kinds of noise you don't want
[1:28:43] all kinds of shouting and all kinds of
[1:28:46] things can you imagine my wife giving
[1:28:48] birth and I'm yelling at her yeah
[1:28:51] yeah
[1:28:53] hope nobody's offended at me
[1:28:55] tonight but you know something we had
[1:28:57] some nice music playing it was a soft
[1:29:01] kind holy and beautiful and and I
[1:29:05] whispered and I
[1:29:07] say you can have this
[1:29:09] child it'll be born of you you'll be
[1:29:12] okay the long Lord has promised us why
[1:29:15] don't we get to the place where our
[1:29:16] young people get here and they're
[1:29:17] snotting and they're crying a real Born
[1:29:20] Again experience with God I I don't
[1:29:21] believe in I'm not against
[1:29:23] that any real minister of God reads the
[1:29:26] message like we do we're not against
[1:29:27] that Holy Ghost spirit of God moving in
[1:29:30] our in our midst and in our beings and
[1:29:32] causes our people to have a real Born
[1:29:34] Again experience with them but get them
[1:29:37] to a place where that little that little
[1:29:40] that little uh chicken within the egg
[1:29:41] can beak its way out can poke its way
[1:29:44] out poke poke poke poke poke we don't
[1:29:46] have to help that little guy if we help
[1:29:48] him out he's going to
[1:29:50] die amen but create an atmosphere the
[1:29:54] people begin to pray in the household of
[1:29:56] faith they begin to reach out their arms
[1:29:58] seeing that little one that's come oh
[1:30:01] God we we've had fellowship with you we
[1:30:03] know you this little one needs to have
[1:30:06] this experience oh God would you find
[1:30:08] them at the altar
[1:30:11] today that we would find our children
[1:30:13] not struggling with depression come
[1:30:16] on fears and
[1:30:19] anxieties amen brother brand would say
[1:30:22] in the resurrection of Jesus he said the
[1:30:24] human heart was made to be happy amen
[1:30:29] worry causes
[1:30:31] cancer temper will cause cancer don't
[1:30:35] ever be
[1:30:37] upset just walk in his
[1:30:40] life I how brother Steve I not be upset
[1:30:43] you've got to
[1:30:45] pray you know wrong and hasty decisions
[1:30:49] are made when you don't get on your
[1:30:51] knees first and
[1:30:53] pray many times husbands I I I just like
[1:30:55] you and I'm just the same we we got
[1:30:58] something in our mind and we we Walts
[1:31:00] into the house and we're sometimes like
[1:31:02] Bulls in the china cabinet and we
[1:31:03] haven't gone before the Lord and we say
[1:31:06] we're going to do it this way and we're
[1:31:07] going to do it that way we're going to
[1:31:09] we go and before you know it
[1:31:10] everything's an
[1:31:12] uproar but if we would have taken just
[1:31:14] that extra few moments and went to our
[1:31:16] closet just for a moment got down our
[1:31:19] knees and said Lord Jesus I don't want
[1:31:22] to upset this household I don't want to
[1:31:24] upset things going I need to have your
[1:31:26] wisdom I need to speak the words from my
[1:31:28] mouth that will turn away
[1:31:32] wrath don't ever be upset just walk in

[1:31:38] him and nothing can harm you there's
[1:31:40] nothing can harm you there's neither
[1:31:43] power things present things future
[1:31:45] nothing can separate us from him amen
[1:31:50] Jeremiah 21:1 for I know the thoughts
[1:31:55] that I think towards you sayith the Lord
[1:31:59] thoughts of peace and not
[1:32:02] evil to give you an expected end call
[1:32:07] unto me and I will hear you amen
[1:32:13] amen I trust that you could just give me
[1:32:16] a couple more
[1:32:18] minutes I asked myself while I Was
[1:32:21] preparing this message I I asked myself
[1:32:23] and I asked the Lord why why don't
[1:32:26] Believers pray I mean we we know we
[1:32:29] ought to pray I I mean we we've read it
[1:32:33] hundreds of times we're Believers today
[1:32:34] we listen to the tapes we hear what the
[1:32:36] prophet why don't we
[1:32:38] pray and these things came to my heart
[1:32:40] and I wrote them
[1:32:42] down sometimes it's guilt
[1:32:45] associated with unconfessed
[1:32:49] sin you get before the Lord before you
[1:32:52] know the devil's a great accuser of the
[1:32:54] Brethren and it comes back into your
[1:32:57] memory and instead of repenting your
[1:32:59] pride stands in your
[1:33:02] way pride comes before the fall amen and
[1:33:07] instead of saying Lord I throw up my
[1:33:09] hands and I Repent Lord I give you all
[1:33:12] of this feeling I give you this guilt
[1:33:14] what do we do we walk away from the very
[1:33:16] thing that can provide life and Liberty
[1:33:19] to
[1:33:20] us many times we feel
[1:33:23] unworthy oh brother so and so is more
[1:33:26] worthy than I sister so and so I am
[1:33:28] unworthy Christ has made you worthy amen
[1:33:32] you see I'm trying to to express this
[1:33:35] words to minister unto you so that you
[1:33:37] move forward and if the Lord shall tar
[1:33:39] into the next year that you'll move
[1:33:41] forward and as the ministry here is

[1:34:09] we're
[1:34:10] praying all right
[1:34:13] yes when you're praying Lord and you're
[1:34:16] striking your breast and you're saying

[1:34:22] not busy looking at everybody else's
[1:34:25] [Applause]
[1:34:27] faults brother didn't shake my hand
[1:34:30] Pastor said that a little bit too rough
[1:34:33] I think I'm going to leave
[1:34:34] church I'm going to do something else no
[1:34:37] your heart is in prayer asking the Lord
[1:34:40] to help those that you don't
[1:34:43] understand did you know that not
[1:34:46] everybody's perfect that comes to church
[1:34:49] wow shocking news
[1:34:52] huh it's all imperfect people that come
[1:34:55] to the house of God and we all make
[1:34:57] mistakes and we all say things harly
[1:35:00] harshly sometimes but we need to have
[1:35:03] Lord have mercy on me we need to have
[1:35:05] Grace for one
[1:35:09] another look beyond our faults look
[1:35:12] beyond the other brother's faults look

[1:35:17] and the fellowship we need with God and
[1:35:19] call for your need call for your
[1:35:21] Brothers need amen we'll find success
[1:35:27] yes amen yes sometimes we don't pray
[1:35:32] because of our
[1:35:34] laziness because of our just neglect
[1:35:36] brother BR would say like this in the
[1:35:38] true sign that's overlooked he would say
[1:35:40] the people won't
[1:35:42] read they don't care to read they won't
[1:35:45] pray because they're got other things to
[1:35:49] do they can't take time to pray and the
[1:35:53] Bible is boredom Bome to them it hasn't
[1:35:58] got enough
[1:36:01] action there's not enough entertainment
[1:36:04] in it I've heard the stories over and
[1:36:07] over again he's going there
[1:36:10] again oh my too
[1:36:12] boring not enough action for these
[1:36:16] modern days or any
[1:36:19] day think of it now
[1:36:23] we don't have time to go every down
[1:36:24] every corner but I want to tell you now
[1:36:29] sometimes we don't pray because of
[1:36:32] excessive
[1:36:35] sorrow we are hurting people sometimes
[1:36:38] in this Christmas season there are some
[1:36:40] that have come together as family to
[1:36:43] Worship the
[1:36:44] Lord I Believe In Worship I don't
[1:36:46] believe in Christmas I Believe In
[1:36:47] Worship amen me too and they've come
[1:36:50] together as families to Worship the Lord
[1:36:52] but there's somebody empty there's a
[1:36:53] seat empty at the table because they've
[1:36:55] lost a loved one
[1:36:57] yes there's somebody
[1:37:00] there that's feeling so full of
[1:37:02] sorrowful because maybe they're under a
[1:37:05] juniper tree
[1:37:08] yes brother Brandon would tell us of his
[1:37:10] own life
[1:37:11] experience in a life story he would say
[1:37:14] and just as I look down to where here
[1:37:18] come a black sheep moving down and I I
[1:37:20] knew what it that it was
[1:37:21] I knew she was going I looked over at
[1:37:24] her like that he's talking about now his
[1:37:26] little girl going and he says and her
[1:37:28] little mouth be coming open her eyes
[1:37:32] crossed over and I said
[1:37:34] Sherry you know you know Daddy honey and
[1:37:38] she was making a little funny noise and
[1:37:40] and I laid my hand over her head then
[1:37:43] Satan moved to me and said will you
[1:37:47] trust him
[1:37:50] now excessive
[1:37:53] sorrow will you trust him now I laid my
[1:37:57] hand on her and said God you gave her to
[1:38:01] me you are taking her away from me
[1:38:04] blessed be the name of the Lord said God
[1:38:07] I can't deny
[1:38:10] you how many would say with me in this
[1:38:12] quotation brother brandom had the joy of
[1:38:14] the
[1:38:15] Lord because it wasn't about
[1:38:19] circumstances it wasn't about what he
[1:38:21] was feeling at the moment it was about
[1:38:25] God moving on the inside of the inside
[1:38:28] did brother Brandon go through J Tree
[1:38:31] experiences yes did other prophets yes
[1:38:34] do you go through them yes but God is
[1:38:37] Victorious for those who call yes

[1:41:13] this have you ever been afraid that he
[1:41:16] might not answer your prayer yes
[1:41:19] sir it's very
[1:41:23] real I don't know I prayed and I'm not
[1:41:27] sure he's going to answer but let me
[1:41:30] give you a truth scripture something
[1:41:32] that will fortify you Matthew chapter 6
[1:41:35] The last part of verse 8 it says for
[1:41:38] your father knoweth what things ye have
[1:41:40] need of before you ask
[1:41:44] them so this is the confidence this is
[1:41:47] the faith we have he knows before you
[1:41:50] even ask
[1:41:52] god brother Bram lays it out so simply
[1:41:54] in the teaching of Moses he says but
[1:41:57] little boy and little girl brother Bram
[1:41:58] is just slaying it all simply he says
[1:42:00] little boy and little girls does God
[1:42:02] hear
[1:42:03] prayer little boys and little girls say
[1:42:05] yes he hears prayer does God answer
[1:42:08] prayer yes yeah does he answer real
[1:42:12] quick not all the time does he no
[1:42:15] sometimes he makes us
[1:42:17] wait can you say that word wait is that
[1:42:21] the time to give up on him when every
[1:42:24] promise that he's ever given us he has
[1:42:26] fulfilled and everything he's ever
[1:42:29] showed us he has worked
[1:42:32] with has he healed you
[1:42:34] before will he do it
[1:42:39] again but we have to wait sometimes is
[1:42:42] that right yes but God answers prayer
[1:42:45] doesn't he and just because everything
[1:42:47] is going wrong that's no sign we should
[1:42:50] be should quit
[1:42:52] praying we just pray on anyhow don't we
[1:42:57] that's right now you answered right God
[1:42:59] answers prayer let let us all say it
[1:43:03] together God answers prayer yes no
[1:43:08] matter what the circumstance are he
[1:43:11] answers call unto me and I will answer
[1:43:16] call unto me and I will answer he will
[1:43:19] answer and he will open the truth of his
[1:43:23] word for us in that season and in that
[1:43:26] time thank you Lord Psalms 4:3 but know
[1:43:31] the Lord has set apart The Godly for
[1:43:34] himself the Lord hears when I call to
[1:43:40] him Psalms
[1:43:42] 18:6 in my distress I call upon the Lord
[1:43:46] to my God I cried for help for his
[1:43:51] Temple he uh he heard my voice and my
[1:43:55] cry to him reaches his
[1:44:01] here word well let's pull up Daniel for
[1:44:04] a witness Daniel did the Lord hear your
[1:44:07] call well I had to wait 21 days but the
[1:44:11] word of the Lord came to him said the
[1:44:13] very day you called y amen I heard what
[1:44:17] you call for and I sent for the angels
[1:44:21] of God I sent forth fortification I sent
[1:44:24] forth for your help and brother Brandon
[1:44:26] would say at the right appointed time he
[1:44:28] sent down the angel he sent down that
[1:44:31] one to go and fix the
[1:44:35] situation amen amen sometimes we have to
[1:44:37] sit in the hospital and wait sometimes
[1:44:39] we have to sit in our room and wait
[1:44:41] sometimes we have to wait for our loved
[1:44:42] ones but we keep on
[1:44:45] waiting because his promises are
[1:44:48] fulfilled Hallelujah yes thank you
[1:44:54] Lord don't let your imaginations get the
[1:44:57] better of you thank you the Bible would
[1:45:00] tell us by Paul in 2 Corinthians 101
[1:45:03] 5 casting down
[1:45:06] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:45:09] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[1:45:11] God and bring into captivity every
[1:45:16] thought to The Obedience of
[1:45:19] Christ
[1:45:21] if you have a negative thought that
[1:45:22] comes through their mind it's not of
[1:45:26] [Music]
[1:45:28] God you know it's the most times where
[1:45:30] the brand focused around healing and
[1:45:32] sickness and often times the devil would
[1:45:34] come in and speak to the people and tell
[1:45:36] them the negative thought against
[1:45:37] healing and brother Brandon would have
[1:45:39] to help them so their faith would
[1:45:41] increase but we've come along down the
[1:45:43] road quite a bit and we have recognized
[1:45:46] who we are we recognize uh who we have
[1:45:50] come to we recognize that we are adopted
[1:45:52] sons of God we don't have to cower
[1:45:55] anymore to the devil speak the word it
[1:45:57] is
[1:45:59] written Satan you've stood in here in
[1:46:01] this parlor too long give back my
[1:46:05] inheritance this belongs to
[1:46:08] me yes cast down your
[1:46:12] imaginations many times we go to
[1:46:13] reasoning cast down the reasonings cast
[1:46:16] them down God don't want to have
[1:46:18] reasonings reasonings always to find
[1:46:21] their way Faith does not Faith believes
[1:46:24] faith has Bulldog hair on its
[1:46:27] chest faith is at six sense my brother
[1:46:30] and I leave you in this if you desire
[1:46:33] for God to move in your situation pray
[1:46:37] and believe
[1:46:39] amen yes yes he's never failed you use
[1:46:44] your imagination and your memories for

[1:46:56] lay on their beds and they see
[1:46:58] themselves dying already way down the
[1:47:00] corridor they see themselves as a dead
[1:47:02] man and who's going to be at my funeral
[1:47:04] and how's it going to be and what songs
[1:47:06] are we going to play no step in to
[1:47:08] something of Christ and see in the
[1:47:11] vision he desires good for you he

[1:47:17] might live A full life amen yes
[1:47:21] brother the Lord has numbered your days
[1:47:25] not the
[1:47:28] devil I know I'm pointing to brother Ron
[1:47:30] but this is the most crucial thing that
[1:47:33] you know of today the devil couldn't
[1:47:35] take brother Ron's life why the Lord has
[1:47:37] determined his
[1:47:41] years he slipped beond I heard the
[1:47:43] testimony he he got into a realm but he
[1:47:46] couldn't see their faces why he was in
[1:47:48] your time
[1:47:52] there's people in this pasture that need
[1:47:53] a
[1:47:55] Shepherd it's not time for that but God
[1:47:58] knows the season and the hour so let's
[1:48:01] not have negative thoughts let's go home

[1:48:35] Christ has stepped into her
[1:48:39] position greater than Solomon is just
[1:48:42] not around us he's in
[1:48:45] us live by faith cast down the reasoning
[1:48:49] live to the six sense that God has
[1:48:52] called
[1:48:55] us we got to have some
[1:48:58] endurance God give us good
[1:49:01] quality to have endurance God give us
[1:49:04] the ability to come to that that judge
[1:49:06] as we were reading in Luke that one that
[1:49:09] neither knew God or knew he didn't
[1:49:11] didn't care for man or God that one of
[1:49:14] scripture and that little woman came and
[1:49:16] kept on
[1:49:17] knocking kept on bothering him the
[1:49:20] Hebrew room word for that word bother
