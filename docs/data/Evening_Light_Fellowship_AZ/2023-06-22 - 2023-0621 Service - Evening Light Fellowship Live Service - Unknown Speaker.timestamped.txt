[13:37] there's so many needs
[13:39] you know in the body and you know it
[13:41] seems like being on the group chat

[13:50] you know it keeps you praying so it's a
[13:54] good thing but you know I've been
[13:56] thinking about brother brother Stephen
[13:58] preached on quiet confidence
[14:02] be still
[14:04] and know
[14:06] when you ask
[14:08] ask abundantly
[14:10] if he said if my son my son asked me for
[14:12] a loaf of bread am I going to give him a
[14:15] stone
[14:16] when you ask you ask with confidence and
[14:18] ensuredness knowing that God is able and
[14:22] willing to fulfill his word we didn't
[14:25] deserve it we can't do anything
[14:27] and I remember when I would go through
[14:29] hard times in my life

[14:43] for his healing that's already taking
[14:45] place
[14:46] and we're going to claim it we're going
[14:48] to claim all these needs I had a friend

[35:01] the the the the meaning of that is to
[35:05] increase gradually in size and quantity
[35:09] so the prophet was preaching about the
[35:12] seven or the 14 feet wings of an eagle
[35:16] and I believe the Bride of the Lord in
[35:20] the last days has a 14 uh fit wings
[35:24] to fly
[35:26] soar above the sky so I will uh we will
[35:30] talk about walking first and we know who
[35:33] walk with the Lord with God and he was
[35:36] not in Genesis chapter 5 21
[35:43] [Music]
[35:51] Enoch walk with God 300 years and had
[35:55] sons and daughters
[35:57] so Enoch walked
[36:00] 365 years
[36:02] and he was not
[36:04] we know the prophet always say from from
[36:07] 1950s until 65 he never changed his his
[36:12] uh message that Enoch walked with God
[36:14] for 500 years
[36:16] amen
[36:18] and here in Hebrew chapter 11 verse 5
[36:21] Enoch by faith Enoch was taken away so
[36:25] that he did not see death
[36:27] and was not found because God had taken
[36:31] him for before he was taken he had the
[36:34] testimony that he pleased God so every
[36:38] step that he took every step that he
[36:42] made it was pleasing to God and what was
[36:45] the testimony of Enoch what kind of walk
[36:48] he did we know the prophet said Enoch
[36:51] built the Pyramid and what was the
[36:54] pyramid it was the second Bible
[36:58] Enoch walk with God it's not easy to
[37:02] carry thousands of tons of of uh rocks
[37:07] to shape that uh the uh as a pyramid and
[37:12] the the the science cannot imitate that
[37:15] pyramid up to now
[37:18] because the the blueprint came from God
[37:21] Amen
[37:23] the prophet said here we know I I was uh
[37:27] when when brother
[37:29] um
[37:30] who was that uh preaching a new year um
[37:33] it was you brother right you were
[37:35] preaching Walking with God
[37:37] amen so uh the the prophet said here
[37:42] and you're here to fulfill
[37:45] just walk unconscious of fear
[37:48] so that's what he did I need the water
[37:55] what what unconscious of fear
[37:57] unconscious of criticism walk
[38:00] unconscious
[38:01] unto the world walk as you walk in
[38:04] Christ walk with him not paying any
[38:08] attention to the right or left
[38:11] just keep moving on
[38:14] so this is the prophet was
[38:17] taking the the scripture of Eno and he
[38:21] applied that to the Believers that you
[38:23] walk with god without looking to your
[38:26] right hand or to your left hand
[38:29] are you left the left side or right side
[38:31] or your left side
[38:33] just walk Focus to the Lord
[38:36] amen
[38:38] the prophet said walk with God if the
[38:42] doctor says you're going to die walk
[38:45] with God
[38:46] the doctor says you can't uh can't well
[38:49] walk with God just walk with God that's
[38:53] all
[38:54] for God has promised you I will never
[38:57] leave you nor forsake you and I'll be
[39:00] with you until the end of the world
[39:02] and he took a note
[39:04] by that Covenant that he gave you that
[39:08] he would confirm it just walk with God
[39:11] you he said you have your ups and downs
[39:15] don't worry
[39:16] you go to uh through the Briars or
[39:19] patches over the sharp rocks over blobs
[39:23] down over the hillside up through the
[39:25] mountains over the waters but walk with
[39:29] God yes sir there's so many Hills to
[39:32] climb upward
[39:34] see if you think about walking
[39:40] there was no concrete road that day
[39:44] God if God will lead Enoch to walk on
[39:48] the mountain he will go through
[39:50] he will go down and you will see
[39:53] sometimes there's a a a a
[39:57] deadly Beast that he will meet
[40:00] but God protected him because the
[40:03] message of the Lord in this day just
[40:05] walk with me
[40:07] amen
[40:09] and he was not
[40:12] but I will pass by to this because I
[40:15] have so many things to say if you will
[40:18] allow me maybe I will allow I will
[40:21] preach for two hours but because of
[40:22] Wednesday I will shorten this
[40:26] I
[40:28] thank you brother David amen I salute
[40:31] you all that sits here on the front
[40:34] amen
[40:36] now running here we are running
[40:40] you know the purse Prophet messenger and
[40:43] apostle was Paul
[40:46] and his message most of you are athletes
[40:49] here
[40:51] um I know brother Russell is a hockey
[40:54] player
[40:55] uh uh who else uh brother
[41:00] um so many athletes here uh brother
[41:02] Justin is a volleyball uh first class
[41:05] volleyball player
[41:10] and most of the love balls
[41:13] amen
[41:15] so so here walk run fly run and walk
[41:21] here is Paul was preaching I think Paul
[41:25] was a was an athlete when he was young
[41:28] because most of his preaching was was
[41:31] boxing running run
[41:35] so he was a he was an athlete
[41:38] so in Hebrew chapter 12 verse 1 he said
[41:41] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[41:45] about with so great a great a uh Cloud
[41:49] the witnesses
[41:51] so uh Paul while we're running there was
[41:55] an audience that giving him
[41:57] encouragement
[41:58] ran Paul run
[42:00] and the first one was Jesus Christ
[42:04] because he said here Cloud the witnesses
[42:07] let us lay aside every weight and the
[42:11] scene which dots so easily beside us and
[42:14] let us run with patience the race that
[42:18] is set before us here's the chapter two
[42:21] looking unto Jesus the author and the
[42:25] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[42:28] that was set before him endured the
[42:31] cross
[42:32] despising the shame and is set down at
[42:36] the right hand of the Throne of God so
[42:38] he was leading us that if I pass this if
[42:42] I did this she will do it too
[42:44] amen he knows what he's doing
[42:50] you know I was searching race most of
[42:54] this uh uh messages I was working with
[42:58] this uh Greek Lexicon
[43:00] and race means agon
[43:04] so Paul was preaching run the race run
[43:09] with agony
[43:11] agon means agony
[43:14] it's not easy as a runner because you
[43:17] need to train hard to run to to win the
[43:20] crown
[43:22] amen
[43:24] Agony means conflict
[43:27] a struggle
[43:29] a a struggle of Faith to the race
[43:34] and do you experience that all the time
[43:37] I experience this all the time
[43:40] amen
[43:44] a Believer must endure hardship
[43:47] you need to exercise
[43:50] absolute and enduring faith
[43:53] in the word of God
[43:55] and keep your eyes on the goal
[43:59] in the power of the cross
[44:02] despite obstacle and challenges
[44:05] Temptation or even treat or threat of
[44:09] death
[44:10] the Believers continue to run the race
[44:14] sister Nancy right now is running her
[44:17] race
[44:18] and I I want to tell you Sister Nancy I
[44:22] am with you
[44:23] I will cheer you I will say run Sister
[44:27] Nancy
[44:28] amen
[44:32] Hallelujah the prophet said
[44:35] I can see one old guy packing
[44:40] he was making himself light
[44:43] because I'm packing up to go to heaven
[44:47] the prophet said brother I'm not packing
[44:50] up to go to heaven I'm unpacking
[44:54] to go to heaven
[44:56] the Rapture Cut Loose everything you
[45:00] need to lay aside every weight
[45:03] can you see the Nike clothes right now
[45:07] they want the lightest of the clothes
[45:11] they have uh
[45:13] uh uh clothes that if you if you're
[45:16] sweating you run a little bit it will
[45:18] dry
[45:20] because of that that millions of dollars
[45:23] that they spent how to how to perfect
[45:26] the clothes so for the for the runners
[45:30] amen
[45:33] in in First Corinthians chapter 9 26
[45:37] therefore so run not as uncertainly
[45:42] so fight I not as one that beat the air
[45:48] so Paul
[45:50] was teaching us brother Paul
[45:53] that it's we're done of Shadow Boxing
[45:58] you know sometimes if you're uh Stephen
[46:01] McNally can can do this because uh he
[46:04] was a he was a kickboxer
[46:08] so
[46:10] so when I was young
[46:14] when I was young I like to box
[46:18] and I like to kick box too because
[46:20] that's how you you get money whether you
[46:24] like it or not you loose you in you get
[46:27] money so I was with this uh a group that
[46:31] we go visit uh if there's a festival in
[46:35] the Philippines every month we have
[46:36] festivals because we're Catholic country
[46:39] so I I was a Catholic I was a not good
[46:43] Catholic
[46:45] so so every every Festival we go to the
[46:50] to to
[46:51] join the boxing
[46:53] so I win I lost
[46:57] I'm not a good fighter
[46:59] so but then I learned how to how to box
[47:02] so you one one two and then you uh if
[47:06] it's if it's a kickboxing you can kick
[47:08] but then at the same time Paul was
[47:10] teaching us that it's too you're done
[47:14] Shadow Boxing
[47:16] you need to fight uh hand to hand combat
[47:20] and you don't need gloves
[47:23] you need to fight the enemy with bare
[47:26] hands
[47:27] this is what Paul wants us to do we need
[47:30] to fight him with bare hands and we know
[47:34] he was the loser he lost 10 000 6 000
[47:39] years ago
[47:40] and he lost two thousand years ago
[47:43] so he was a loser and were the an
[47:46] overcomer
[47:48] so that's why Paul was encouraging us
[47:50] and by the way
[47:52] I was searching tonight
[47:55] that every year we add
[47:59] words in the dictionary
[48:02] 2023
[48:04] 300 more than 300 words they added in
[48:07] the dictionary if there's a words that I
[48:10] will say that you cannot understand
[48:11] that's a new word
[48:17] amen
[48:19] so here's Paul was teaching us how to
[48:22] not to to fight beat the air anymore
[48:26] we need to to face the devil
[48:30] but then here brother Branham he was a
[48:34] he was a professional boxer
[48:37] don't you know brother Branham was 15-0
[48:40] in the Golden Gloves
[48:43] so 15-0
[48:47] why he became a a a a good boxer
[48:51] because there was a trainer
[48:54] you need to defend to the trainer
[48:57] a pure not if I I trained myself when I
[49:01] was young
[49:02] that's why I always lost
[49:05] but here brother Branham he had a
[49:08] trainer you know what's the name of the
[49:09] trainer
[49:11] six seconds meet
[49:13] so six seconds meet he was he he he
[49:17] knocked out the air the the opponent for
[49:20] only six seconds
[49:22] oops
[49:25] one two three
[49:27] pass out
[49:29] and here's brother Branham
[49:32] six seconds Smith was training him
[49:35] and look at the how how he trained
[49:38] brother Branham
[49:40] when I first started training for boxing
[49:42] before I got in a professional fighting
[49:47] there used to be a trainer as they
[49:50] called him
[49:51] six seconds meat
[49:54] the first professional fight he had he
[49:58] whipped the man in six seconds
[50:01] and when he started training that man
[50:04] like uh when when I started training
[50:07] that man he liked to kill me
[50:11] he knocked me the he knocked me plump
[50:14] out of the ring and everything else
[50:17] and I was keeping ropes and running
[50:20] seven eight miles every day and taking
[50:24] all the training
[50:27] and I said six
[50:29] why don't you have to do me that way
[50:34] I said you just knocked the breath out
[50:37] of me oh man brother Branham is like a
[50:41] man
[50:42] I I went plump over four ropes
[50:45] come right out of there in the uh in
[50:49] among them chairs and like to broke my
[50:53] back on me
[50:54] he laughed so here's the trainer
[51:00] look Billy he said I don't care how
[51:03] physically fit you are
[51:05] your body has got to be able to stand up
[51:09] come back right quick
[51:12] if you take a Hard Punch said if your
[51:15] body is not used to coming back you're
[51:18] lay there and take the count he said but
[51:21] if your body is used to taking it
[51:25] and then coming back every time you hit
[51:28] or you hit it that shocks the blood runs
[51:32] it back to the heart said if you do that
[51:36] said then your body is used to coming
[51:39] back quick when you get knocked down
[51:42] you're on your feet again
[51:45] see I said that don't mean a thing when
[51:49] you get knocked out down or knocked down
[51:52] up on your feet again quick said you
[51:55] hate me now
[51:57] but you appreciate me when you get out
[52:00] there in the ring
[52:02] and that was right
[52:06] the prophet said the trainer don't baby
[52:09] you
[52:11] that's why the preachers sometimes
[52:13] preach hard here and it seems like
[52:15] hundreds of Believers here why why
[52:18] brother wrong it's keep uh preaching on
[52:21] me
[52:22] why brother Run keep keep picking on me
[52:26] but don't you know brother one don't
[52:29] know you
[52:31] the holy spirit is speaking
[52:34] God is using the lips of the preacher
[52:37] here
[52:39] sometimes you knock out
[52:41] but the prophet said you need to be
[52:44] trained hard so that once you knock down
[52:46] the blood will start all over again to
[52:49] your body go to the heart
[52:51] and you can stand up
[52:54] there was a uh I was sitting on the
[52:57] table of there and there's a wood
[53:00] said
[53:02] don't give up
[53:04] so that was good
[53:07] so run the prophet said here sorry
[53:12] run with message we find the church in
[53:17] anemic condition
[53:20] we ought to be great strong Mighty
[53:23] Warriors of faith
[53:24] that would shake a nation
[53:28] God give it to us
[53:31] we would just receive it so there's
[53:34] little thing upon us that holds us back
[53:37] from running
[53:39] let's lay aside all those little weights
[53:43] now because you're looking into the
[53:45] author of uh author to the author and
[53:48] the finisher of our faith Jesus Christ
[53:50] who was made man on Earth and dwelt
[53:54] Among Us and was made sin that through
[53:57] his righteousness we might be forgiven
[54:00] of our sins
[54:01] he became us sinners that we might
[54:05] become his righteousness
[54:08] so we need
[54:10] a pure in anemic condition right now my
[54:14] brothers and sisters
[54:16] get a a uh uh blood transfusion from uh
[54:21] the process of calvary
[54:24] the blood of Jesus Christ is still fresh
[54:27] and ready to transfuse to you
[54:31] so that you will become strong and
[54:34] mightier again
[54:36] amen
[54:37] running the race
[54:39] oh in second Corinthians 11 23 he said
[54:43] there they are Ministers of Christ
[54:46] here's here's Paul running
[54:49] I will I will show it to you how he run
[54:52] the race
[54:54] it's not easy to run
[54:57] brother Branham Brian uh when he was a
[55:00] boxer he run eight miles a day
[55:03] so Paul hero he was running
[55:07] are they minister of Christ I speak as
[55:10] full
[55:12] I am more in labor more abundant in
[55:15] Stripes above measure in prisons more
[55:17] frequently in debts often
[55:22] and the Jews five times received by 40
[55:25] Stripes save one
[55:28] 39
[55:29] 5 times
[55:32] twice was I beaten with rods
[55:36] once was stoned twice I suffered
[55:39] shipwreck
[55:41] a night and day I have been in the Deep
[55:44] in Journey or in journeying often in
[55:48] Perils of waters in Perils of robbers in
[55:52] perils by my own countrymen in Paris by
[55:56] the heathens in perils in the city in
[55:59] perils in the wilderness in perils in
[56:01] the sea and in perils among false
[56:04] brethren
[56:05] in weariness and in faithfulness
[56:09] or faithfulness in watching often in the
[56:13] hunger and thirst
[56:14] in fasting often in cold and nakedness
[56:20] this is how Paul run in his day
[56:24] a prophet messenger and apostle
[56:30] amen
[56:34] that's why I cannot wait to
[56:37] to see him brother I will spend ten
[56:39] thousand years talking with him over
[56:42] there how did you overcome Paul
[56:45] who was with me uh you were with me over
[56:49] there in Mexico the the Mexican Brothers
[56:51] was telling us about the experience of
[56:54] the the testimonial brother Ron
[56:57] right
[56:59] so brother Ron had the testimony over
[57:01] there with the with the with uh with the
[57:04] brothers in Mexico
[57:06] and that was like 1980s
[57:09] and they still remember
[57:11] he said brother uh you you need to tell
[57:14] this to brother Ron this is his
[57:17] testimony that we still holding on
[57:20] he said he had a vision that that on
[57:24] that Vision he was in heaven
[57:27] and then he was
[57:29] he was uh so ashamed of himself because
[57:32] here was sitting on the long table was
[57:36] the prophets the apostles and the the
[57:38] great men that they gave their lives in
[57:42] the Lion's uh uh in the arena
[57:45] and here they were talking about their
[57:48] testimony and here was brother one
[57:51] uh uh I don't have a testimony
[57:55] but then there was a voice asking him
[57:59] what age are you came from
[58:02] and he said
[58:04] laodicean age and all of the eyes of
[58:07] those big men like like The Heroes of
[58:10] Faith
[58:12] was looking on him
[58:14] and they cannot believe that
[58:17] you passed the loudest in age
[58:22] you know you we're thinking about Paul
[58:25] we're thinking about the the men and
[58:27] women gave up their lives
[58:30] for the cause of Christ
[58:32] that they will they will rather die burn
[58:36] in the cross
[58:39] kids sometimes you know the story of
[58:43] polycarp
[58:45] he never gave up
[58:48] he said for 65 years God did so much to
[58:52] me how can I deny him
[58:56] and here I was the uh
[58:59] thinking I want to spend time with Paul
[59:02] and I believe the the Believers
[59:05] the the the Believers from the from the
[59:09] past epician age and the titarian age
[59:12] cannot wait to see you also
[59:15] so don't give up
[59:17] amen
[59:19] and here Paul was talking I'm done with
[59:23] Paul almost Paul was talking
[59:26] uh in second Timothy chapter four seven
[59:30] he said
[59:32] I have fought a good fight
[59:35] I have finished my course
[59:37] I have kept the faith henceforth there
[59:41] is laid up for me a crown of
[59:44] righteousness
[59:46] which the Lord the righteous judge shall
[59:49] give me at the day at that day and that
[59:53] to me only
[59:54] but to all of them
[59:57] all of you
[1:00:00] that love his appearing
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:06] and here
[1:00:08] if we go to the
[1:00:10] 10th chapter 10 or chapter 4 verse 10.
[1:00:15] it said
[1:00:17] me
[1:00:21] having love his present world
[1:00:24] and is departed unto thessalonica
[1:00:28] syrians to galatia
[1:00:31] and Titus into Dalmatia so here was Paul
[1:00:36] and Prophet The Prophet was asking
[1:00:40] himself
[1:00:41] he said how did Demas left him
[1:00:47] and and brother Abraham said Dimas was a
[1:00:49] a preacher
[1:00:51] he did not go to to uh to the club and
[1:00:56] drink beer
[1:00:58] he said he was still preaching the word
[1:01:02] but he cannot associate himself with
[1:01:05] Paul Paul
[1:01:07] because Paul was an old-time preacher
[1:01:12] but this man was going to the to the
[1:01:16] popularity side
[1:01:21] and here's Paul as I always say a
[1:01:25] prophet a messenger an apostle
[1:01:29] very popular
[1:01:31] preacher
[1:01:34] but here
[1:01:37] chapter 13 or verse 13.
[1:01:40] he said
[1:01:42] the cloak that I left I throw us which
[1:01:46] Cyprus when thou comest bring with thee
[1:01:50] and the books but especially
[1:01:52] the parchment
[1:01:54] and Paul
[1:01:57] have only one coat
[1:02:00] he was cold when he was writing to
[1:02:03] Timothy
[1:02:05] he said can you please bring me that
[1:02:08] coat
[1:02:09] that's the only one I left
[1:02:15] Brothers
[1:02:17] we are so thankful
[1:02:19] that God is bless us so much
[1:02:22] I can open my closet and I still have
[1:02:25] five coats
[1:02:31] but this is how he run the word the
[1:02:33] message in his day
[1:02:36] if you don't compromise the word brother
[1:02:39] you are unpopular
[1:02:43] the people maybe don't even know you
[1:02:49] amen
[1:02:50] but here I got where I got my my uh
[1:02:54] title
[1:02:55] in First Corinthians 15 55
[1:02:58] this is Paul
[1:03:00] ready to offer himself
[1:03:05] he said
[1:03:07] oh death
[1:03:09] where is thy sting
[1:03:11] oh gray where is your Nike
[1:03:17] The Sting of death is sin
[1:03:20] and the strength of sin is the law
[1:03:25] but thanks be to God which giveth us the
[1:03:29] Nike
[1:03:30] through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:33] therefore
[1:03:35] my beloved Brethren be a steadfast and
[1:03:38] movable
[1:03:39] always abounding in the work of the Lord
[1:03:42] for as much as she know that your labor
[1:03:46] is not in vain in the Lord
[1:03:49] you know what is labor
[1:03:51] the process of childbirth
[1:03:56] agony
[1:03:58] your your labor is not in being your
[1:04:01] Agony is not in vain
[1:04:04] yet so hard brothers and sisters
[1:04:08] but I believe the scripture said put God
[1:04:11] first in your life and all these things
[1:04:13] will be added unto you you put God first
[1:04:17] try him test him
[1:04:21] he will you will see the effect in your
[1:04:24] children you will see the effect even
[1:04:27] into your your friends and your
[1:04:29] neighbors
[1:04:31] you know if we put God first wherever we
[1:04:33] go brother
[1:04:35] we bring Christ
[1:04:38] I was with uh I was I my my CPR and the
[1:04:42] first aid was expired so I went to this
[1:04:45] training
[1:04:47] and the the trainer was uh asking
[1:04:50] questions and then uh uh he answered
[1:04:53] himself because no one did the answer uh
[1:04:56] his question and you know what I said I
[1:04:59] said amen
[1:05:06] wherever you go
[1:05:08] the word of God is still in your mouth
[1:05:11] amen
[1:05:13] so and then everybody was like who is
[1:05:17] that
[1:05:22] I was I was in the I was working in the
[1:05:25] home health uh in Chicago before
[1:05:28] that was 1997.
[1:05:31] and you know this uh owner of the Home
[1:05:33] Health
[1:05:34] they were not Christians
[1:05:37] but then they saw me every time I eat I
[1:05:41] pray
[1:05:43] and one day I think 2017
[1:05:48] their granddaughter
[1:05:51] did something a disease that the doctor
[1:05:54] the saint uh the Children's Hospital
[1:05:57] cannot find the Cure
[1:05:59] cannot find what kind of disease hit
[1:06:01] this uh uh girl she was nine years old
[1:06:05] and this girl was was in coma for six
[1:06:08] months
[1:06:11] and you know what they what happened
[1:06:13] they remembered that Warren
[1:06:16] that that Warren that always pray
[1:06:19] and they called me he said Warren are
[1:06:23] you still in Arizona I said yes I still
[1:06:25] I'm still here in Arizona can you please
[1:06:28] go to the Children's Hospital and pray
[1:06:30] for my granddaughter
[1:06:33] and you know what was in mind
[1:06:36] brother Ron
[1:06:38] so I called brother I texted brother one
[1:06:40] I said brother Ron will you go with me
[1:06:43] to the hospital in Saint Luke
[1:06:46] and brother Ron was not my pastor
[1:06:50] but you know the willingness
[1:06:53] the willingness
[1:06:54] because
[1:06:56] who wants to see a miracle
[1:06:59] and we argue anointed
[1:07:02] in this day that we can bring life we
[1:07:06] can bring the word of God in this dying
[1:07:09] and the uh filthy age
[1:07:14] and brother one said I'll be there when
[1:07:18] I got there brother one was already
[1:07:20] outside the door of the hospital
[1:07:23] so when we went there
[1:07:26] we talked to the to this uh this uh uh
[1:07:30] parents
[1:07:31] and then we prayed
[1:07:34] and you know what brother on said to
[1:07:36] that lady to that girl
[1:07:39] so we put the Bible on her
[1:07:43] and brother Ron said I want you to go to
[1:07:46] church
[1:07:47] this girl was a Catholic
[1:07:51] and then the next day
[1:07:54] the the uh Grand I think the grand Aunt
[1:07:58] sent me uh a photo of the little girl
[1:08:02] who was smiling for the first time she
[1:08:04] was smiling
[1:08:06] and after two weeks she's out of the
[1:08:09] hospital
[1:08:10] and you know what she said she said I
[1:08:13] want to go to the church
[1:08:17] and the girl right now is going to this
[1:08:20] uh Palm crop I don't know where is that
[1:08:22] but Palm crop it's a non-denomination
[1:08:25] church here in Phoenix
[1:08:26] and the rest of the family are Catholic
[1:08:29] she's she's uh 14 years old now
[1:08:35] see the power of the spoken word
[1:08:38] amen I want you to go to church
[1:08:44] amen
[1:08:49] Paul
[1:08:51] he looked on that blade
[1:08:54] and said
[1:08:56] where is your victory
[1:09:00] oh death where is yours thing
[1:09:05] see how why you're so brave
[1:09:09] why he Paul was so brave to face death
[1:09:13] because he know whom he believes
[1:09:18] amen
[1:09:21] confidence
[1:09:25] we're going to to to fly high now
[1:09:30] so we are we're done with walking and
[1:09:32] running
[1:09:34] flying
[1:09:37] you know brother Branham
[1:09:40] most of his preaching
[1:09:43] and if you go to the 1960s most of the
[1:09:48] preaching uh to 65
[1:09:50] are different
[1:09:52] you see the the elevated message
[1:09:57] you saw the the message that it's not
[1:10:00] for the denomination anymore
[1:10:02] the denomination don't want any uh uh
[1:10:06] friendship with brother Branham or or
[1:10:09] association with brother Branham
[1:10:12] so brother Branham he was studying about
[1:10:16] this loads of Encyclopedia that the the
[1:10:19] brother gave it to him
[1:10:22] and he found out
[1:10:24] he said you know Einstein group that if
[1:10:28] two forces are coming fast enough
[1:10:31] they could pass right through each other
[1:10:34] and never never bother each other
[1:10:40] two
[1:10:46] um
[1:10:48] it said uh the the
[1:10:51] um never bother each other if two cars
[1:10:55] were coming down the road
[1:10:57] and they were both going at the terrific
[1:11:00] speed
[1:11:02] faster than sound
[1:11:04] just billions of miles per second
[1:11:08] they probably pass right through each
[1:11:11] other
[1:11:12] without hurting one another at all
[1:11:16] see even this and the bottle of water
[1:11:20] if I have a perfect speed or speed
[1:11:25] I will hit these two objects and it will
[1:11:29] pass through without breaking each other
[1:11:35] that's what the message
[1:11:38] is is preaching to us
[1:11:41] that we need that at the terrific speed
[1:11:46] now he said uh by force striking
[1:11:50] striking together when you see we are
[1:11:54] such an Earthbound people
[1:11:56] they're all uh about all we think about
[1:12:00] and can think about is always time and
[1:12:02] space
[1:12:04] but when we leave this world we go into
[1:12:08] where there is no time
[1:12:10] we can think of 50 miles an hour
[1:12:14] 100 miles an hour
[1:12:16] or 2 000 miles an hour or 10 000 miles
[1:12:21] an hour that don't even start when we
[1:12:24] think of Eternity how fast
[1:12:28] Jesus
[1:12:30] after he had been glorified and received
[1:12:34] his glorified body raise up from the
[1:12:36] dead and has ascended on high to the
[1:12:40] father came back in a few seconds
[1:12:45] later and when such a terrific speed
[1:12:49] till he come right in before his
[1:12:52] disciple through a wall and never even
[1:12:55] moved the wall
[1:13:02] maybe that's a only five miles a second
[1:13:06] or five miles an hour
[1:13:12] now
[1:13:15] he said till that come right in before
[1:13:18] his disciple through a wall and never
[1:13:20] even moved the wall and yet with a body
[1:13:24] that could stand there and eat fish and
[1:13:28] bread
[1:13:29] that speed coming true
[1:13:33] see that's perfect speed that's the body
[1:13:37] that we will go through
[1:13:41] don't think about 100 miles an hour
[1:13:44] brother oh if I can drive a Tesla
[1:13:47] 60 UH 60 miles per second is it per
[1:13:52] second
[1:13:57] the prophet here
[1:13:59] in the message
[1:14:01] question and answer 1964.
[1:14:05] he said
[1:14:06] this Mortal bodies will not see death
[1:14:11] but just
[1:14:13] of a sudden there will be like a sweep
[1:14:16] go over us
[1:14:21] can I take up my
[1:14:26] sure
[1:14:29] there's there will be like a sweep go
[1:14:32] over us under chains
[1:14:35] they're turned back like Abraham was
[1:14:37] from an old man to a young man
[1:14:41] from an old woman to a young woman
[1:14:44] that's this sudden that's this Sudden
[1:14:47] Change
[1:14:48] and after a while you're traveling like
[1:14:51] a thought
[1:14:53] I want to go see my loved ones in
[1:14:55] Germany
[1:14:58] I'm in Germany it's just like a thought
[1:15:01] it's just like a speed from from
[1:15:04] eternity when Jesus came down it's just
[1:15:06] a second
[1:15:08] and he passed through the wall because
[1:15:11] of a terrific speed
[1:15:14] I cannot wait to go to that body
[1:15:17] brothers that a perfect body for us
[1:15:22] that is your gift
[1:15:24] because you're faithful
[1:15:26] that is the price of the Lord to you he
[1:15:29] will give you a gift
[1:15:31] you know when when I was young I was I
[1:15:34] was I had a classmate a rich uh a boy
[1:15:38] and this man was you know the dad was
[1:15:41] telling him if if you pass if you you
[1:15:43] pass your grade
[1:15:45] we will bring you to Manila and Manila
[1:15:48] was a very popular place but crowded and
[1:15:51] polluted
[1:15:53] I will bring you to Manila and the kid
[1:15:56] was so happy yes Dad I will pass my test
[1:16:00] and he did
[1:16:01] but to us
[1:16:03] if you pass the test
[1:16:06] you will travel like a thought I will
[1:16:09] bring you wherever you want to go
[1:16:11] I want to say I want you to see your
[1:16:14] your loved ones in the in the Germany or
[1:16:17] England they are in the Philippines
[1:16:19] or in Colombia hermana
[1:16:25] so this he said what this Sudden Change
[1:16:28] and after a while you're traveling like
[1:16:31] a thought and you can see those
[1:16:34] then who are already resurrected oh what
[1:16:38] an hour
[1:16:39] then we're gathered with them and then
[1:16:42] be caught up with them to meet the Lord
[1:16:45] in the air
[1:16:47] it's not an unnecessary brother remember
[1:16:51] this is a a flying season now
[1:16:54] this is not a one horse rider or or how
[1:16:57] do you call it one horsepower
[1:17:00] yo at the time of Enoch it's a one horse
[1:17:03] or one-man power
[1:17:05] but in the time of Paul that was an
[1:17:07] airplane age
[1:17:09] but our age is an astronaut age
[1:17:13] hallelujah it's an eagle age
[1:17:17] oh you will meet the Lord in the air
[1:17:19] it's not necessary if your uncle or bear
[1:17:22] or is buried down in Southern Kentucky
[1:17:26] if he has uh be brought up in Indiana or
[1:17:29] buried in Indiana has to be taken so
[1:17:32] Southern to be taken to Southern
[1:17:35] Kentucky no matter where he is
[1:17:38] them are dead in in the sea shall rise
[1:17:42] from the sea
[1:17:44] maybe there was a brothers and sisters
[1:17:46] from Titanic wants to go to America at
[1:17:49] that time
[1:17:52] and they were buried in the sea you know
[1:17:54] those uh there were men and women over
[1:17:57] there faithful
[1:17:59] you know brother Branham was telling a
[1:18:01] story about this woman the the the the
[1:18:04] the
[1:18:05] I think the captain was telling her to
[1:18:08] to save herself
[1:18:11] actually and she said in either way I'm
[1:18:14] a winner
[1:18:16] she said why why I'm a winner if God
[1:18:19] will save this ship I will see my
[1:18:22] daughter in New Jersey but if God will
[1:18:24] sink this ship I will go to Glory
[1:18:27] in either way I'm a winner
[1:18:31] see the positive mind of the Christian
[1:18:36] if your uncle is buried down in the or
[1:18:38] uh here in the
[1:18:41] where am I um no matter where he is then
[1:18:45] are dead in the sea shall rise from the
[1:18:48] sea those that were destroyed in the
[1:18:51] arena and ate by Alliance those who are
[1:18:55] thrown in the fiery furnace and not even
[1:18:58] the bones will be lifted or the lip or
[1:19:03] the Dust
[1:19:06] they shall still rise
[1:19:09] whether they was in Rome or in Arena at
[1:19:13] Rome or with whether they were in the
[1:19:17] Tropic Jungle of Africa or South Africa
[1:19:20] or in the pros and regions of the north
[1:19:25] they rise from the dead
[1:19:28] and be changed and be brought up
[1:19:31] and the living shall be changed in the
[1:19:34] moment in a twinkling of an eye and be
[1:19:37] caught up together what is twinkling of
[1:19:40] an eye
[1:19:42] you know the the maybe the children or
[1:19:45] brother
[1:19:46] um Stephen knows how to say
[1:19:49] um uh beautiful eyes so they will uh
[1:19:53] uh open and close their eyes
[1:19:56] but it's like a twinkling of an eye
[1:19:59] you will change to from mortality to
[1:20:02] immortality
[1:20:04] amen
[1:20:07] oh the prophet said here you know the
[1:20:10] eagle
[1:20:11] is a Heavenly bird
[1:20:14] you know if you if you the eagle will
[1:20:17] fly high above the sky
[1:20:20] and the vulture and the hawk will follow
[1:20:24] the eagle
[1:20:25] brother they cannot reach that Sky
[1:20:28] brother because the the the body will
[1:20:31] disintegrate
[1:20:33] the pressure
[1:20:35] you know the the that's the the the the
[1:20:38] Eagles can see five times better than
[1:20:43] humans
[1:20:45] they have an eye that they can see the
[1:20:48] more they fly high they can see more
[1:20:50] better
[1:20:53] and God is anointing you
[1:20:55] like an eagle
[1:21:00] my
[1:21:02] but here is the world
[1:21:05] if God is anointing you like an eagle
[1:21:09] the world right now the prophet said
[1:21:13] you take the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit
[1:21:16] of a man
[1:21:18] and his lower
[1:21:19] than the animal
[1:21:22] he's worse than the animal
[1:21:25] that's a hard thing to say
[1:21:29] go read that uh when you go home
[1:21:32] you continue reading that was a hard
[1:21:35] saying
[1:21:38] but I was thinking of this story brother
[1:21:40] uh
[1:21:41] brother Justice
[1:21:45] about this man
[1:21:47] because of the recession
[1:21:50] here
[1:21:52] in America
[1:21:55] you know we go to the to the gas station
[1:21:58] you see Biden was I did it
[1:22:03] and it's five dollars almost five
[1:22:06] dollars
[1:22:07] and I was like ah I thank the Lord that
[1:22:10] I'm driving Toyota Corolla
[1:22:16] but here this young man
[1:22:18] lost his job
[1:22:21] and you know what happened
[1:22:23] he went to the zoo he passed by in San
[1:22:26] Diego
[1:22:27] and there was a hiring
[1:22:32] work the next day
[1:22:34] so he went there and checked if he can
[1:22:37] if he's uh he can work uh to that kind
[1:22:41] of job and they said yeah you're you're
[1:22:43] in
[1:22:44] you're hired
[1:22:46] so he said this is a very simple
[1:22:49] very simple job
[1:22:52] the gorilla died yesterday
[1:22:56] and the gorilla because most of the
[1:23:00] people likes this gorilla
[1:23:02] I want you to put the a gorilla suit
[1:23:08] and and I want you to don't do anything
[1:23:11] just lay down on the at the end of the
[1:23:15] defense
[1:23:18] and he said the the the boss said don't
[1:23:22] do anything because the you maybe you
[1:23:24] will uh get tempted by the kids and he
[1:23:27] said yeah okay 17 an hour
[1:23:31] and so he was laying there
[1:23:34] and while he was laying
[1:23:37] you know what happened
[1:23:39] there was the here was the kids
[1:23:42] cute gorilla cute gorilla and they
[1:23:46] uh throw bananas to the gorillas to the
[1:23:49] gorilla and the gorilla was uh he loved
[1:23:52] bananas
[1:23:53] so he was tempted so he took the banana
[1:23:57] and ate and then here was the girl's
[1:23:59] boys giving him bananas and then the the
[1:24:03] kids once uh the the gorilla to swing
[1:24:07] and uh said gorilla there's a a rope
[1:24:12] over there a swing Gorilla swing and he
[1:24:15] was tempted but he was so happy because
[1:24:17] he ate a lots of bananas
[1:24:21] so he was like swinging
[1:24:24] and then going back and forth
[1:24:26] but he over swung brother like
[1:24:30] and he over
[1:24:32] he went over the fence
[1:24:37] and over the fence
[1:24:39] there was a lion laying
[1:24:43] and the lion stood up because when he
[1:24:46] saw the lion he screamed
[1:24:49] [Applause]
[1:24:52] and did the lion run after him like
[1:24:55] brother you can see the fangs and the
[1:24:58] lion run to that gorilla and then when
[1:25:02] that gorilla with the lion uh ready to
[1:25:05] to to to grab him he said the lion was
[1:25:09] like ready to when he grabbed this
[1:25:11] gorilla he said stop screaming or we
[1:25:16] will lost both of us we lost our job
[1:25:26] so even the lion was human
[1:25:34] you know but but now here's
[1:25:39] the prophet when I read that story I
[1:25:42] said it's true
[1:25:43] man right now is like acting like
[1:25:46] gorilla and lions
[1:25:51] see
[1:25:52] the lowest without the Holy Spirit of a
[1:25:55] man he's lower than animal
[1:25:58] he's worse than animal
[1:26:01] that's a hard thing to say
[1:26:03] you know I I don't think I can apply to
[1:26:06] that kind of job
[1:26:10] I'd rather pass that job
[1:26:13] but Eno walk God
[1:26:16] and at the end
[1:26:18] you know here was Enoch
[1:26:21] when he was walking at the end of the
[1:26:23] road
[1:26:24] all of the sudden it was like a slow
[1:26:26] motion like a a slow motion going up and
[1:26:31] up to heaven
[1:26:33] because
[1:26:35] God provided an astronaut or a suit for
[1:26:39] Enoch
[1:26:41] what do you call that uh how do you call
[1:26:43] that that suit uh Aston
[1:26:46] spacesuit
[1:26:48] and here was Paul when he was running he
[1:26:53] got pressurized also and went to the
[1:26:55] third heaven
[1:26:57] see brothers and sisters that's how we
[1:27:00] Enoch did and Wonderland
[1:27:04] but here was the prophet in our days
[1:27:07] because of breaking preaching about the
[1:27:10] astronaut Age The Eagle age and all of
[1:27:13] the sudden he was thinking he was uh uh
[1:27:17] on his bed and he said I'm over 50 now
[1:27:21] and I don't know if I I when all of the
[1:27:25] sudden there was a voice
[1:27:27] and the voice said keep pressing on
[1:27:30] keep pressing on
[1:27:32] and uh the voice said I asked him do you
[1:27:35] want to see
[1:27:37] over there
[1:27:39] and he said I I'm so glad to
[1:27:42] to to go there
[1:27:44] and all of the sudden
[1:27:46] see the terrific speed all of the sudden
[1:27:49] he was there
[1:27:52] so you know where we were catholic
[1:27:55] when I was 20 I was a Catholic and we
[1:27:58] thought before that if you die you will
[1:28:02] fly
[1:28:03] your your ghost will come out from your
[1:28:06] body and fly
[1:28:08] and then you see your loved ones crying
[1:28:11] and you're you're smiling with them
[1:28:15] that's what the Catholic teaching
[1:28:18] but if you're no good you will go to
[1:28:21] purgatory
[1:28:23] but here
[1:28:25] the message is teaching us not to be
[1:28:27] ignorant of the things above
[1:28:30] he wants you to know where you're going
[1:28:34] now here was brother Branham all of the
[1:28:37] sudden he went to the to another
[1:28:40] dimension
[1:28:42] and then here in the sixth Dimension he
[1:28:45] saw
[1:28:47] the love his loved ones here Sharon or
[1:28:50] or Meda and Sharon and then this 90 year
[1:28:54] old woman
[1:28:56] she said all the women there
[1:28:59] they were perfect their teeth is like a
[1:29:02] pearl
[1:29:03] they were beautiful
[1:29:06] and there was no fleshly lost over there
[1:29:10] it's all perfect love
[1:29:14] Brothers I cannot wait to go there
[1:29:17] we cannot wait to go there
[1:29:19] you know sometimes if you think about
[1:29:21] that you think about pain
[1:29:24] oh maybe it's too painful
[1:29:27] but you once you have the revelation of
[1:29:31] this hour that you will just pass from
[1:29:34] death and to life
[1:29:37] my
[1:29:40] and here was brother Branham he saw
[1:29:42] millions of people
[1:29:44] and he said are they all branhams
[1:29:48] said no
[1:29:49] there are all your converts brother
[1:29:52] Branham saw me over there Brothers God
[1:29:56] brother Branham saw you over there
[1:30:01] brother Branham saw you over there
[1:30:04] all of us
[1:30:07] pressing on
[1:30:08] keep pressing the bottle
[1:30:11] we already won the battle
[1:30:14] because he won
[1:30:16] we just connected with him
[1:30:20] in Isaiah 40 but they that wait upon the
[1:30:24] Lord shall renew their strength
[1:30:27] that's the secret just wait upon the
[1:30:30] Lord
[1:30:31] and God will renew your wings
[1:30:35] God will give you a pressurized suit
[1:30:38] that you can go above from this world
[1:30:43] you see the world sometimes why God put
[1:30:46] me here why God and you need to be
[1:30:48] thankful you're not in San Francisco
[1:30:53] you're still okay here
[1:30:56] sometimes I forgot my garage open during
[1:30:59] the night
[1:31:03] brother about this uh
[1:31:07] um countdown to uh the news from the
[1:31:10] news
[1:31:12] do you have that
[1:31:15] Washington DC this is a January 24th
[1:31:18] 2023
[1:31:21] the scientists projected that this
[1:31:25] Doomsday Clock before when brother
[1:31:27] Branham was preaching he said three
[1:31:28] minutes before midnight
[1:31:30] but here is the scientist
[1:31:33] declaring the Doomsday Clock Was set
[1:31:37] at 90 seconds
[1:31:39] to midnight
[1:31:41] you know the prophet was was preaching
[1:31:44] about the countdown right
[1:31:46] the countdown
[1:31:48] the human countdown is 10. 9 8 7 6 5 4 3
[1:31:56] 2 1 but the Heavenly countdown is seven
[1:32:01] one two three four five six seven
[1:32:08] rupturing age
[1:32:11] the bright age
[1:32:13] and here we are
[1:32:15] this the news is confirming that we are
[1:32:18] in the last days
[1:32:20] due to the largely but not exclusively
[1:32:24] to Russia invasion to Ukraine and the
[1:32:27] increased risk of nuclear
[1:32:30] escalation the new clock time was also
[1:32:34] influenced by count uh continuing
[1:32:37] threats possessed by the climate crisis
[1:32:40] Chris's
[1:32:41] and the breakdown of global norms and
[1:32:45] institutions needed to
[1:32:50] mitigate risk associated with advancing
[1:32:54] Technologies and biological threats such
[1:32:58] as covet 19.
[1:33:01] now did you see that do you have the
[1:33:03] photo

[1:33:23] brother the bride right now is outside
[1:33:26] of laodicea
[1:33:29] they cannot accept us
[1:33:32] but we know this because we have the
[1:33:35] prophet
[1:33:36] God cannot do anything unless he will
[1:33:39] reveal reveal his secret to his servant
[1:33:41] the prophet
[1:33:44] that's the the scary part to the to the
[1:33:48] world
[1:33:49] but it's a glorious day for the bride
[1:33:53] we can that's why we can sing from our
[1:33:55] hearts that's why we can worship God
[1:33:58] because when brother Branham was
[1:34:01] preaching this astronaut age
[1:34:03] I was thankful that he would we can see
[1:34:07] better we can see above this this uh the
[1:34:11] world

[1:34:31] then walk
[1:34:33] but if you cannot walk
[1:34:36] you rather crawl than staying nothing or
[1:34:39] doing nothing here
[1:34:42] we need to do something
[1:34:45] we need to spread this message
[1:34:48] amen
[1:34:51] Hallelujah
[1:34:52] before I I close this I will invite the
[1:34:57] musician
[1:35:00] there was an Olympic Games
[1:35:03] in Mexico in 1968
[1:35:06] the marathon is the final event of the
[1:35:09] program
[1:35:11] the Olympic stadium is packed and there
[1:35:15] is excitement as the first athlete an
[1:35:19] Ethiopian Runner
[1:35:21] enters the stadium
[1:35:23] the crowd erupts
[1:35:25] as he crosses the finish line
[1:35:30] way back in the field is another Runner
[1:35:34] his name is John Stephen
[1:35:37] akuari of Tanzania
[1:35:40] he was been eclipsed by the other
[1:35:44] runners
[1:35:45] after 30 kilometers his head is
[1:35:49] troubling his muscles are aching and he
[1:35:53] fall into the ground
[1:35:55] he has serious League entries
[1:35:58] and the officials want him to retire
[1:36:03] but he refuses
[1:36:05] with his knee bondage
[1:36:08] aquari pick up himself picks himself up
[1:36:13] and hubbles the remaining 12 kilometers
[1:36:16] to the finish line
[1:36:19] and an hour after the winner has
[1:36:21] finished aquarie enters the stadium all
[1:36:25] but a few thousands of the crowds have
[1:36:28] gone home
[1:36:29] akhawari move around the track
[1:36:34] at the
[1:36:36] ah it's so hard to pronounce this pins
[1:36:40] takingly slow pace until finally he
[1:36:45] collapses over the finish line
[1:36:48] it is one of the most heroic efforts of
[1:36:51] the Olympic history
[1:36:53] afterward asked by the reporter why he
[1:36:57] had not dropped out akawari says my
[1:37:00] country did not send me to start the
[1:37:03] race
[1:37:04] they sent me to finish the
[1:37:07] record
[1:37:11] God did not
[1:37:14] Choose You
[1:37:16] to start here and not finish the race
[1:37:21] God anointed you before the foundation
[1:37:24] of the world that you are an eagle
[1:37:28] that you are an astronaut
[1:37:30] brother Paul that this message is an
[1:37:33] astronaut
[1:37:35] we can fly higher than the world we can
[1:37:39] see because of the revelation of God we
[1:37:42] can see the world is in Doomsday
[1:37:46] but how thankful we are that we are
[1:37:49] above the world we are above this filthy
[1:37:53] and uh worst generation in our age
[1:37:59] and when I was reading this I was
[1:38:02] touched by the message

[1:38:21] you know it it the time of the the The
[1:38:25] Heroes of Faith there was women over
[1:38:28] there fed to the Lions
[1:38:32] but their challenge is you you deny
[1:38:35] Christ or you will go to the Lion's Den
[1:38:38] here in our day every day brother it's a
[1:38:42] bottle
[1:38:44] Satan is trying to tempt you Satan is

[1:38:53] because you're in a wrong side
[1:38:57] that's what you hear from Satan all the
[1:38:59] time
[1:39:00] but why
[1:39:02] you are still here
[1:39:04] because God did not send you to start
[1:39:06] God sent you to finish the race
