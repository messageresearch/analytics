[25:25] I thought of these requests were made
[25:27] this morning
[25:29] how many of you have a responsibility
[25:31] personally towards these problems
[25:36] that's very few compared to the people

[25:42] to these things
[25:44] if we take these things to heart this
[25:47] morning wet how many of you want to see
[25:50] victory in your heart and life
[25:52] how many of you want to see God heal the
[25:56] sick and raise the dead even though they
[25:58] have nothing to do with you right now
[26:00] you want that yes
[26:02] let us pray yes Lord let us us pray our
[26:06] heavenly father this morning
[26:08] we come Lord with such simplicity
[26:12] I heard that song this morning leave it
[26:15] up to Jehovah
[26:17] how easy it is Lord to walk away and
[26:20] leave it to Jerusalem to Jehovah when it
[26:24] is a responsibility given to us as
[26:26] Believers as for me oh God let us pray
[26:30] for the sick remember the lame and
[26:32] remember the halt the blind let the
[26:35] power of God Rule and reign in hearts
[26:38] and lives of the wives and the husbands
[26:41] and the children and even though it
[26:43] doesn't have anything somewhat to do
[26:45] with him Lord it is very much so may we
[26:49] feel within our heart a challenge Lord
[26:52] to conquer all opposition that comes
[26:55] before a believing person we asked you
[26:58] this morning Lord as we prepare our
[27:00] minds Lord may we look for great
[27:03] miracles signs and wonders to visit each

[57:30] moment
[57:36] amen
[57:37] um
[57:38] yes it's true
[57:40] um brother Gideon retief
[57:43] was on his way to church
[57:46] this morning and he had a heart attack
[57:51] and then he went off the road there was
[57:54] a slight accident to how severe it was I
[57:57] don't know
[57:58] and they tried to resuscitate him for
[58:01] quite a long time but he had already
[58:04] crossed over
[58:06] um I did speak to Paul Moritz which is
[58:09] he's married to Linda Moritz
[58:37] Linda is uh Gideon's sister
[58:43] and
[58:45] so Paul and I spoke a little bit
[58:49] I said brother Paul we don't understand
[58:51] God we don't know
[58:57] sometimes his plan
[58:59] but we know this we trust God
[59:04] he knows
[59:07] the day we were born and he knows the
[59:09] day that we'll pass away and when this
[59:11] Mortal life
[59:13] shall stand still guess what that's the
[59:15] greatest healing of this Mortal body
[59:19] that we will ever have
[59:22] and one way I'm envious of brother
[59:24] Gideon
[59:26] yeah
[59:29] he checked out and left us here
[59:33] but we will fight a good fight
[59:38] and we will continue on
[59:40] until that day
[59:43] I told him I said the Lord willing I
[59:46] will be there you remember they had
[59:48] asked me of
[59:49] I would do brother Willy's funeral and
[59:53] because of covet and all that we
[59:55] couldn't go but I said uh Lord willing I
[59:58] said I will be attending the funeral I
[1:00:00] don't know when that will be but the
[1:00:02] Lord willing in the next couple weeks I
[1:00:04] plan to be there to be a support to the
[1:00:07] family and to give my sincere
[1:00:10] condolences
[1:00:12] uh to them
[1:00:15] um

[1:00:21] prayer for my daughter Rebecca she goes
[1:00:23] in on uh Monday for a biopsy
[1:00:27] colon cancer
[1:00:30] and
[1:00:32] the prognosis does not look good
[1:00:36] so we need a miracle
[1:00:40] and I know a miracle working God
[1:00:46] so I put my trust in God more than I put
[1:00:49] my faith in anything else
[1:00:53] but I do request your prayer for her
[1:00:58] um
[1:00:59] this coming Monday at 3 45.

[1:01:39] stuff so we're asking you right now if
[1:01:41] you'll come here with us and remember
[1:01:43] the great miracle that God did for
[1:01:46] Isaiah their son
[1:01:49] and all those tumors and stuff on his
[1:01:53] his back his spine and he came and and
[1:01:57] we prayed for him and guess what God
[1:01:58] took all of them away and it was a great
[1:02:01] miracle we believe that God is a miracle
[1:02:04] working God please come up here yeah and

[1:02:34] and when God opens the door God give us
[1:02:37] Grace and courage to do that which God
[1:02:39] has for us

[1:07:00] have been pleasantly pleased to see the
[1:07:04] tremendous potential
[1:07:06] in the young people of the Next
[1:07:08] Generation coming up within this body
[1:07:11] I see god-given talents of young men and
[1:07:14] young women to be the the future deacons
[1:07:17] and trustees and the future School

[1:07:42] mini battles

[1:07:47] experiences

[1:07:50] sometimes many heartaches
[1:07:54] but I just want to say that if I had to
[1:07:57] do it all over again if I had to do
[1:08:00] everything all over again I wouldn't
[1:08:04] change one thing
[1:08:06] I would do the same thing that I've done
[1:08:09] for 30 years
[1:08:11] all over again
[1:08:13] God has been good
[1:08:15] God has been good

[1:08:53] morning
[1:08:54] I want to thank each and every one of
[1:08:56] you
[1:08:57] for standing by our side
[1:09:00] it wasn't always perfect but we always
[1:09:04] stuck together put our shoulder to the
[1:09:07] wheel
[1:09:08] to get done what we needed to get done
[1:09:10] we never fussed them much or had many
[1:09:14] divisions we just sort of all got along
[1:09:18] and got it all done
[1:09:20] isn't that the way it's supposed to be
[1:09:23] sure I honor the trustees and all the
[1:09:26] different ones that I've worked with
[1:09:28] over the years
[1:09:30] Brother Andy and all the different ones
[1:09:33] my goodness we love you buddy
[1:09:36] and I just want to say thank you all the
[1:09:39] other departments that have
[1:09:42] helped us become one in unity in one to
[1:09:48] reach a common goal and one
[1:09:52] to to press forward in Christ
[1:09:56] when our Lord and savior came down from
[1:10:00] a place of absolute perfection
[1:10:03] he descended down down down and he
[1:10:08] he made himself lower than the angels
[1:10:11] and he came to a place where he took on
[1:10:14] a form not a form of a great conquering
[1:10:18] King that would destroy the Roman armies
[1:10:21] no
[1:10:23] he took on the form of a servant
[1:10:27] and from the pastorship all the way down
[1:10:30] to every office of this church
[1:10:33] there's no big eyes and little u's
[1:10:36] were servants
[1:10:38] we're servants to who
[1:10:41] the apple of God's eye his elect seed
[1:10:47] this is all about servitude
[1:10:50] there is nothing in any of us
[1:10:54] that are worth anything unless we have
[1:10:56] Christ indwelling inside of us that's
[1:10:58] right
[1:11:00] and he is so pleased because he said if
[1:11:02] you do it unto the least of one of these
[1:11:04] you do it unto me
[1:11:07] the least of one of these this is the
[1:11:09] reward the reward is to take care of
[1:11:13] God's sheep
[1:11:18] it's all about the Sheep if the Sheep
[1:11:22] aren't here we don't have a church we
[1:11:27] don't have a body
[1:11:30] so I just want to thank you for the
[1:11:33] privilege of being able to serve you for
[1:11:36] the last three decades
[1:11:38] and I want to say it's been an immense
[1:11:41] pleasure
[1:11:42] to serve you
[1:11:44] I now as I see the potential of the
[1:11:47] young people in our church I'm ready to
[1:11:49] pass the Baton
[1:11:52] I know that this next generation is a
[1:11:56] powerful generation
[1:11:58] such potential on them and it's makes me
[1:12:01] so pleased that I can step down now and

[1:20:24] for then will I turn the to the people a
[1:20:27] pure language
[1:20:30] that they may call upon the name of the
[1:20:33] Lord to serve him
[1:20:35] with one consent may God add the
[1:20:39] blessing to his word you all may be
[1:20:41] seated this morning in God's presence
[1:20:44] turn with me now in your bibles if you
[1:20:47] would please too
[1:20:48] First Peter chapter 1.
[1:20:52] First Peter chapter 1 verses 7 through
[1:20:56] 9.
[1:20:59] that the trial of your faith being much
[1:21:02] more precious than of gold that
[1:21:05] perisheth
[1:21:08] though it be tried with fire might be
[1:21:11] found unto the praise and honor and
[1:21:13] Glory at the appearing
[1:21:15] of Jesus Christ
[1:21:18] whom having not seen you love in whom
[1:21:22] though now you see him not yet believing
[1:21:25] we Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
[1:21:29] of Glory
[1:21:31] receiving the end of your faith
[1:21:34] even the salvation of your souls do you
[1:21:38] see the end result of faith
[1:21:41] is the Salvation of your souls
[1:21:45] notice verse 7 again there
[1:21:48] the trial of your faith
[1:21:52] every one of you will be tried
[1:21:55] there is no exemption
[1:21:58] there is no tunnel there is no easy way
[1:22:01] and let me tell you life is not easy
[1:22:06] he said all things will work together
[1:22:08] for the good it did not say they would
[1:22:10] all be good but he would use bad to
[1:22:13] produce good
[1:22:14] I have faith in God that he he knows
[1:22:18] what he's doing
[1:22:23] first John chapter 5.
[1:22:29] verses 1 through 5.
[1:22:38] whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[1:22:42] Christ is born of God
[1:22:45] and everyone that loveth him that beget
[1:22:48] loveth him
[1:22:49] also that is begotten of him
[1:22:53] by this we know that we love the
[1:22:56] children of God when we love God and
[1:22:59] keep his Commandments
[1:23:00] for this is the love of God that we keep
[1:23:03] his Commandments as and his Commandments
[1:23:05] are not Grievous
[1:23:07] for whatsoever is born of God overcometh
[1:23:10] the world
[1:23:14] and this is the victory that overcomes
[1:23:17] the world
[1:23:18] even
[1:23:20] our faith
[1:23:25] who is he that overcometh the world
[1:23:29] but he that believeth that Jesus is the
[1:23:33] son of God
[1:23:34] may God
[1:23:36] bless his word to every heart this
[1:23:39] morning
[1:23:40] and father I'm asking you for once again
[1:23:44] Sovereign Grace
[1:23:50] I would like to title
[1:23:52] my sermon this morning
[1:23:56] learning to speak God's language
[1:24:01] and I want to take a subject of speak
[1:24:04] the word
[1:24:08] now I don't know if any of you have ever
[1:24:10] had an opportunity to learn another
[1:24:12] language
[1:24:15] but it's Unique
[1:24:18] it's different
[1:24:21] in the first
[1:24:23] little while that you start to learn
[1:24:25] another language and you try to
[1:24:28] enunciate you try to formulate you try
[1:24:33] to conjugate a sentence in another
[1:24:36] language it's so foreign to your ear
[1:24:41] you chuckle you think
[1:24:43] did that make any sense to he who was
[1:24:46] listening to me
[1:24:50] just to learn another language
[1:24:54] is foreign to your ear
[1:24:58] and
[1:24:59] you must overcome your shyness
[1:25:03] and your immaturity
[1:25:06] to try to speak it
[1:25:10] you must have boldness
[1:25:15] I remember that my wife who was actually
[1:25:19] far better in German especially in
[1:25:22] the conjugation of German
[1:25:26] and everybody that knew me
[1:25:29] they knew I was unafraid to attempt
[1:25:33] to speak German
[1:25:38] and
[1:25:40] I always said that
[1:25:42] yes I know I make many mistakes yes I
[1:25:46] know my grammar is not correct yes I
[1:25:48] know that the feminine masculine and
[1:25:52] neuter gender is not exactly correct yes
[1:25:55] I know that I probably use the the
[1:25:58] informal uh hostu instead hobbin Z
[1:26:03] and
[1:26:05] yet I was unafraid
[1:26:09] and I began to to to speak it and and oh
[1:26:14] did I make mistakes
[1:26:17] how many of you have ever tried to learn
[1:26:20] another language and you realize oh my
[1:26:24] to try to even think in that language
[1:26:29] um is extremely hard but much less try
[1:26:31] to speak it
[1:26:33] and so you've got to get over the fear
[1:26:36] and I'm I'm taking this somewhere this
[1:26:38] morning so listen carefully
[1:26:41] because
[1:26:42] we have to learn to speak God's language
[1:26:47] God has a language and that language is
[1:26:50] Faith I'm not talking about a dialect
[1:26:52] that you were born with I'm not talking
[1:26:54] about this speech that you use to
[1:26:58] communicate one with another but I'm
[1:27:00] talking about a language that God uses
[1:27:02] regardless of your speech or your
[1:27:05] dialect or your country or your color or
[1:27:08] your ethnicity or your education God
[1:27:10] will speak to every one of you through
[1:27:14] faith
[1:27:20] and as he speaks to you as a father
[1:27:24] speaks to his child
[1:27:27] and he says say dada
[1:27:32] it's important
[1:27:35] that you teach
[1:27:36] the little children say Dad
[1:27:40] not Mama that that
[1:27:42] you look at them say Dad Dad they go
[1:27:44] mama
[1:27:48] no dada
[1:27:51] but anyway there's something about it
[1:27:54] that as you begin to take this little
[1:27:57] child and they began to now formulate in
[1:28:01] their mind this language
[1:28:03] that they're hearing
[1:28:06] and by the hearing of the ear it goes
[1:28:08] into the mind and they try to put it
[1:28:10] together
[1:28:12] and they learn sometimes quickly on
[1:28:15] certain things and other things they
[1:28:17] don't
[1:28:19] but nevertheless they learn
[1:28:22] and then they begin I don't know if
[1:28:24] you've ever seen a little child just
[1:28:28] before they really go to formulating it
[1:28:30] they have all kinds of gibberish
[1:28:34] and they just sit there and they chitter
[1:28:37] and chatter and they say all kinds of
[1:28:39] stuff and you're wondering I wonder what
[1:28:41] that kid is saying
[1:28:44] now I remember my son Matthew we thought
[1:28:46] he would never learn to talk
[1:28:49] because Rebecca was his translator for
[1:28:53] every grunt and groan and she carried
[1:28:56] him around long enough until his feet
[1:28:58] were dragging and she held him on her
[1:29:01] hip and she you know and he goes I go
[1:29:05] what in the world does did he just he
[1:29:07] wants water
[1:29:09] uh
[1:29:11] he wants food
[1:29:14] she would translate I said Rebecca stop
[1:29:17] let this kid learn to speak himself I
[1:29:20] want all of you to understand you don't
[1:29:23] need somebody speaking for you you need
[1:29:26] to make yourself understood quit this
[1:29:28] gibberish quit this immature talking
[1:29:30] learn to speak and learn to come boldly
[1:29:33] Before the Throne because if you have
[1:29:35] got something to say say it
[1:29:43] amen
[1:29:46] it's God's language
[1:29:48] the language of faith
[1:29:52] you have to learn to speak it
[1:29:55] in every situation and all that we go
[1:29:57] through
[1:30:00] and I want to take this subject of
[1:30:03] speaking the word
[1:30:07] because as God speaks to you through
[1:30:10] faith
[1:30:11] he is actually giving you the language
[1:30:14] of the word that it's written in
[1:30:18] because it's an encrypted message
[1:30:23] it is not given to those who have wisdom
[1:30:28] and education and learning
[1:30:33] but it is something that is given to the
[1:30:36] elect and brother Branham said in every
[1:30:38] elect predestinated seed is the ability
[1:30:42] to hear
[1:30:47] you have a receiver
[1:30:51] you have the ability to hear what God is
[1:30:56] speaking
[1:30:58] and since
[1:31:00] the confounding
[1:31:02] of the language at Babel
[1:31:06] man has been in such a confused State
[1:31:09] and let me tell you
[1:31:12] this age is an age of confusion it's
[1:31:16] getting worse and worse seducers and
[1:31:19] educated men and it just goes on and on
[1:31:22] until they are a bunch of educated
[1:31:24] idiots
[1:31:27] pardon the expression that's probably
[1:31:29] not
[1:31:31] good
[1:31:32] terminology
[1:31:36] man has constantly battled with
[1:31:40] understanding of one another it's hard
[1:31:43] enough in English to make ourselves
[1:31:44] understood
[1:31:47] am I understanding what I think you
[1:31:50] thought you said which you know that I'd
[1:31:53] like to read that thing up here one day
[1:31:56] do I understand what I think you were
[1:31:59] wanting to say and everything we we we
[1:32:01] talk over and around
[1:32:04] I mean you know my wife lesser heart
[1:32:08] women have this ability to to when they
[1:32:12] communicate they they they go before
[1:32:14] after they use all of the the you know
[1:32:17] prerequisites and everything and I see
[1:32:21] cut to the chase
[1:32:24] stop stop it you know you're you're
[1:32:26] always not letting me speak
[1:32:31] did you wreck the car
[1:32:34] how bad are you okay
[1:32:37] all right now do the fill in
[1:32:39] anyway
[1:32:42] many times we as men are not good
[1:32:44] listeners
[1:32:46] and the older we get you would think
[1:32:48] that with
[1:32:50] the gray hair would come wisdom
[1:32:53] but sometimes we find out that we still
[1:32:56] do not understand one another because
[1:32:58] we're in a confusing world
[1:33:03] the language can be a barrier for
[1:33:06] Fellowship
[1:33:08] because if we do not know what one
[1:33:11] another are wanting to say to one
[1:33:13] another uh our fellowship is so limited
[1:33:18] God's Fellowship to you
[1:33:21] depends on how much of his language you
[1:33:24] will understand
[1:33:28] otherwise
[1:33:30] it's just
[1:33:33] vain speaking
[1:33:38] when we don't understand one another
[1:33:41] it brings confusion
[1:33:43] and if there was ever a Time
[1:33:46] when the author of confusion who's the
[1:33:49] author of confusion
[1:33:51] the devil and if there's ever a time of
[1:33:54] confusion and people not knowing who
[1:33:58] they are
[1:33:59] and what gender they are and what
[1:34:02] identity they are of and uh you know
[1:34:06] they just don't know
[1:34:09] I thank God that God has given to us a
[1:34:12] message that speaks God's language and
[1:34:15] lets you know where you come from and
[1:34:19] that you're a part of God right that you
[1:34:21] you you're not wandering around
[1:34:23] wondering about your identity because
[1:34:26] your identity speaks to you of your
[1:34:29] destiny
[1:34:37] now let me just say this and I probably
[1:34:40] will go into this
[1:34:43] in a greater depth later but brother
[1:34:45] Branham
[1:34:46] as he's coming into the maturity of his
[1:34:50] ministry
[1:34:51] he's realizing that the word of God Is
[1:34:54] So revealed to him that he cannot help
[1:34:58] the third pull from manifesting at times
[1:35:03] we all know the third pull is the
[1:35:06] revealing of the word
[1:35:08] he had to know his position
[1:35:11] he had to know that he was sent for a
[1:35:14] purpose
[1:35:15] in fact when he thought his ministry was
[1:35:18] over God had to say it ain't over this
[1:35:21] up furtherance of your ministry about
[1:35:24] the time when the doors are closing and
[1:35:26] people are are are not inviting him
[1:35:29] anymore guess what his ministry is just
[1:35:32] beginning
[1:35:35] the shock had to be
[1:35:37] taken away from the wheat
[1:35:46] so brother Brenham said on that day when
[1:35:49] God came down and saw all the men there
[1:35:52] and Babble and then building a tower and
[1:35:55] so on and so forth he said let us
[1:35:57] confuse the tongue
[1:35:59] and so here was a bunch of prideful men
[1:36:03] that we're trying to achieve something
[1:36:06] by their own intellect and their
[1:36:08] scientific ability and their education
[1:36:11] and God said I gotta I'm gonna have to
[1:36:14] go down and confound them unless they go
[1:36:17] ahead and build the very thing of the
[1:36:19] imagination of their heart
[1:36:21] and so God took that group of men and
[1:36:24] proud and boastful and scientific
[1:36:27] and confounded them but then God on the
[1:36:31] day of Pentecost had to take humble
[1:36:36] yielded
[1:36:39] vessels
[1:36:41] and give them
[1:36:43] a new language
[1:36:46] and what it was was it was not a new
[1:36:49] tongue a new dialect it was them to
[1:36:51] speak of the Great and Powerful
[1:36:53] wonderful works of God
[1:36:57] that's God's language
[1:37:01] so he takes one and confounds then and
[1:37:04] he turns right back around because God
[1:37:07] is one
[1:37:09] we are one body One Faith one Lord one
[1:37:13] baptism one one one one what language
[1:37:15] are we gonna speak in heaven let me tell
[1:37:18] you it's going to be God's language
[1:37:20] and that language is Faith and faith is
[1:37:23] a gift of God so guess what you don't
[1:37:25] got to go to Babel to have Babble
[1:37:28] translate you won't need to have Google
[1:37:31] Translate what it is you'll have a Holy
[1:37:34] Spirit and it'll translate
[1:37:41] in fact I'm going to say something
[1:37:46] that may throw you a curveball
[1:37:49] you won't have to do a lot of
[1:37:52] talking over there
[1:37:57] you could just be sitting with someone
[1:37:59] walking with someone and
[1:38:02] look at them and go
[1:38:07] why you're catching one another's
[1:38:09] thoughts knowing the thoughts intents of
[1:38:12] the heart you won't need this mouse
[1:38:14] anymore you won't need to speak it
[1:38:16] because there'll be something inside of
[1:38:18] you that will have a communication far
[1:38:22] greater
[1:38:23] then these mortal lips
[1:38:25] [Applause]
[1:38:29] in fact just watch the natural Hume uh
[1:38:33] Union of husband and wife
[1:38:37] after they've been together for a while
[1:38:39] guess what he speaks half a sentence
[1:38:44] and then may he may stop and
[1:38:47] Go off into Oblivion for a moment
[1:38:50] and she goes
[1:38:52] I know exactly what you're thinking
[1:38:55] and she finishes the sentence my wife
[1:38:58] does that to me
[1:38:59] quite often in fact after I get done
[1:39:01] with this service you will say you
[1:39:03] forgot this and you forgot
[1:39:06] thank God for wives huh we need them
[1:39:10] they're a help me
[1:39:15] I'm realizing the more and more that I
[1:39:17] need her when I drive
[1:39:19] turn here
[1:39:21] oh turn right
[1:39:24] that's the way home well thank you honey
[1:39:26] honey I'd be lost without you telling me
[1:39:33] I saw a little clip this guy his wife
[1:39:36] talking to him and everything like this
[1:39:38] and and says I'm so glad for my wife
[1:39:40] because she tells me how to get home and
[1:39:42] said where would I be without my wife
[1:39:44] and so he says I'm in the car and I'm
[1:39:46] driving around a field going in circles
[1:39:48] and a police officer comes over and said
[1:39:50] what are you doing buddy he says well
[1:39:52] I'm I'm trying to get home
[1:39:54] he says well what's the matter and he
[1:39:56] said my wife's not here
[1:39:58] he said well I'm just going to give you
[1:40:00] a warning don't go out with her again
[1:40:03] foreign
[1:40:06] okay
[1:40:08] now watch this on the Seal of Christ in
[1:40:11] 1955 I want to show you what brother
[1:40:12] Brahm said
[1:40:14] because I want to bring us all back to
[1:40:15] understand that God speaks a language
[1:40:18] so now what was
[1:40:21] confused at Babel is returned at
[1:40:25] Pentecost
[1:40:26] remember Pentecost is an experience
[1:40:30] okay on the Seal of Christ at the day of
[1:40:33] Pentecost where tongues was confused
[1:40:36] with Babylon he brought them back into
[1:40:38] one fellowship at Pentecost
[1:40:41] amen what the devil did at Babylon
[1:40:44] scattered Brotherhood God brought
[1:40:47] Brotherhood together at Pentecost Holy
[1:40:51] Spirit himself speaking through the
[1:40:53] people to the people
[1:40:57] hey
[1:40:58] I believe that well what do you know
[1:41:01] about that we hear them in our own
[1:41:03] language what do you know about that
[1:41:07] see science and education are the
[1:41:11] Devil's Bible
[1:41:15] it destroys the nutrients within the
[1:41:18] food
[1:41:19] takes away our nourishment brother Brown
[1:41:21] said the reason you are the Way You Are
[1:41:26] he says it's because the food you eat
[1:41:30] it has no longer the nourishments and
[1:41:32] the vitamins
[1:41:34] and no matter how many Big Macs you eat
[1:41:36] you will never get the nourishment that
[1:41:39] you think that you really need out of it
[1:41:41] especially with your diet coke
[1:41:45] and supersize the fries
[1:41:51] diseases
[1:41:53] sicknesses
[1:41:55] mental inabilities
[1:41:58] and different things that are coming on
[1:42:00] the face of the Earth brother Branham
[1:42:02] said women go into menopause at an early
[1:42:05] age why because we've taken all the
[1:42:08] nutrients because we think we're smarter
[1:42:10] than God so they hybrid the corn they
[1:42:13] hybrid the wheat they hybridize the
[1:42:16] everything that's supposed to have seed
[1:42:18] and so now we live in an age where
[1:42:21] everything is becoming seedless
[1:42:26] no nutrients looks bigger and better but
[1:42:28] guess what don't have that nutrients
[1:42:30] that you need
[1:42:32] now I'm not here on on health and and
[1:42:34] all of this and and I want you to have
[1:42:37] nothing but Keel for lunch today uh no
[1:42:40] that's not it
[1:42:44] although I believe that some of us
[1:42:46] should be eating healthier
[1:42:48] okay just be aware of that because it
[1:42:51] catches up to you as you get older
[1:42:54] amen
[1:42:56] all right so everything that's consumed
[1:43:00] by the masses today
[1:43:03] is nothing but hybrid foods that have
[1:43:06] lost their nutrients in their vitamins
[1:43:10] now brother Branham says
[1:43:14] in
[1:43:16] 1955 he takes a sermon called law
[1:43:19] Paul speaking here of the valley or the
[1:43:21] shadow rather
[1:43:23] the law of the shadow of good things to
[1:43:25] come could never make the worshiper
[1:43:27] perfect
[1:43:28] then he goes on to show what the
[1:43:31] Perfection is
[1:43:33] now it's a strange thing that this is so
[1:43:36] much thought of people they say well I
[1:43:39] am weak
[1:43:41] my faith is not very much I'm not a very
[1:43:44] good Christian hello
[1:43:47] have you ever said those words why did
[1:43:51] you choose someone like me
[1:43:55] that's just what the devil wants you to
[1:43:58] say you're just talking his language
[1:44:01] right there how many of you believe he
[1:44:04] has a language what is it unbelief it's
[1:44:07] dealt
[1:44:10] so when you start doubting and you start
[1:44:13] having all of these questions there's
[1:44:15] nothing wrong with the question but you
[1:44:17] better know where you're getting your
[1:44:19] answers from
[1:44:23] you're just talking his language right
[1:44:27] then so I want to say if if unbelief and
[1:44:31] doubt is the devil's language there must
[1:44:34] be a language of God
[1:44:36] his is only belief
[1:44:41] it is have faith in God
[1:44:45] amen that's his language
[1:44:49] we must never say that don't ever let
[1:44:52] your testimony be negative let it be
[1:44:54] positive all the time I'm saved I have
[1:44:58] God in my heart I believe him with all
[1:45:00] my heart do you believe in Divine
[1:45:02] Healing with all of my heart
[1:45:06] let your testimony always your thoughts
[1:45:09] everything
[1:45:09] never permit a negative thought to come
[1:45:12] in your mind if you can help it
[1:45:15] when it starts and don't entertainment
[1:45:18] well you say I can't help the thoughts
[1:45:19] from coming well that's like the farmer
[1:45:22] that said he couldn't he he couldn't
[1:45:24] stop the birds from flying over his
[1:45:27] place but he could sure stop them from
[1:45:30] Rusty
[1:45:32] that's a good thing
[1:45:34] you can't help the thoughts when they
[1:45:36] come but don't entertain them just pass
[1:45:39] it on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior
[1:45:43] all things are mined by God and I'm
[1:45:46] going to keep them I'm going to testify
[1:45:48] of them
[1:45:49] and God can only bless you watch this
[1:45:52] talk about speaking God's language
[1:45:55] God can only bless you as you confess
[1:45:57] that he has done it for you
[1:46:01] he's the high priest of our confession
[1:46:05] is that right Hebrews 3 he said that
[1:46:07] he's a high priest of our confession he
[1:46:10] can only do for us as we accept it we
[1:46:13] believe it and we confess it
[1:46:19] he said many times the holy spirit is
[1:46:21] powerless
[1:46:22] to bring you Deliverance to bring you
[1:46:25] healing to bring you the things that you
[1:46:27] are asking for why
[1:46:31] he said because you're not speaking
[1:46:33] God's language
[1:46:34] and he said you've got to profess it
[1:46:37] first
[1:46:38] you he says before you see it confess it
[1:46:45] before it happens
[1:46:47] confess it he says because the holy
[1:46:50] spirit will force your body to come into
[1:46:54] subjection of what you're seeing
[1:46:58] yeah
[1:47:00] amen
[1:47:03] it's time
[1:47:06] for us to start speaking by faith
[1:47:10] that's God's language
[1:47:13] that he speaks and we've got to learn to
[1:47:15] speak it
[1:47:16] so quit babbling
[1:47:19] and start formulating Faith sentences
[1:47:25] speak the word
[1:47:28] yeah well it it sounds so foreign I know
[1:47:32] because you were born into this world
[1:47:34] speaking lies you spoke the devil's
[1:47:37] language but now God's trying to teach
[1:47:40] you
[1:47:42] to believe him
[1:47:51] that's why
[1:47:53] in those
[1:47:55] five indications of the spoken word he
[1:47:59] said they were sovereignly given
[1:48:03] he said sovereignly given at the time I
[1:48:06] wasn't asking God
[1:48:09] to give me squirrels I wasn't asking God
[1:48:12] to resurrect that little fish I wasn't
[1:48:16] I was there when an event happened
[1:48:20] I want all of you to understand there
[1:48:23] are events there are trials there are
[1:48:25] things there are accidents there are
[1:48:27] things that are going to happen in your
[1:48:29] life and I want you to be sensitized to
[1:48:32] the fact that God is there and he may be
[1:48:35] having a sovereign moment
[1:48:38] for you to speak the word
[1:48:44] now it's not something watch God
[1:48:47] sovereignly gave it
[1:48:49] this isn't something that he was out
[1:48:51] there fasting and praying for
[1:48:54] no Sovereign I want you to understand
[1:48:56] you don't work it up
[1:49:02] just let God have his way
[1:49:05] be sensitized enough that if he speaks
[1:49:07] you'll listen
[1:49:09] foreign
[1:49:12] 1959
[1:49:16] 12 23 right before Christmas
[1:49:21] he says he that man was so completely
[1:49:24] yielded to the devil
[1:49:26] till the devil used his tongue to talk
[1:49:30] now you can be so completely yielded to
[1:49:33] God till God can use your tongue
[1:49:37] to talk
[1:49:42] the Bible says whatsoever you yield your
[1:49:45] members to you become the servant
[1:49:46] thereof
[1:49:48] either to righteousness or
[1:49:50] unrighteousness I say God let me be so
[1:49:53] sensitive let me be so yielded to you
[1:49:56] that when I speak it ain't me speaking
[1:50:03] amen
[1:50:05] that's right
[1:50:06] that's what I claim any sermon that I
[1:50:10] ever preached that had any meaning to it
[1:50:13] is when I got yielded got William bran
[1:50:15] I'm out of the way and Christ could take
[1:50:17] in
[1:50:18] and start talking
[1:50:24] because he can speak in a language
[1:50:30] comprende
[1:50:32] for stage two
[1:50:36] what language you want me to say it in
[1:50:41] do you understand
[1:50:44] God speaks
[1:50:46] in a language
[1:50:49] and as you hear him speak and you see
[1:50:52] him on what he's doing and you see the
[1:50:55] opportunities in the Bible of what when
[1:50:58] there was situations he's spoke to the
[1:51:01] situation
[1:51:04] now as the prophet of God began to
[1:51:07] mature in his ministry
[1:51:10] and quit listening to all of the
[1:51:12] dissenting voices
[1:51:14] and quit forgetting the doors are
[1:51:17] closing it looks like he's Ministry is
[1:51:19] washed up it's not washed up it's
[1:51:22] refined
[1:51:27] you've got all the chaff away
[1:51:30] and he says now
[1:51:32] William Branham so now
[1:51:34] the revealed word to him
[1:51:39] cannot contain itself
[1:51:43] until the word emanates
[1:51:48] and God didn't morph
[1:51:51] are you understanding
[1:51:54] that the language of God now coming down
[1:51:58] into a son of man Ministry
[1:52:02] Now understand this it wasn't William
[1:52:05] Branham
[1:52:07] it was the son of man revealing to you
[1:52:09] the son of man
[1:52:11] so what is it it's the language of the
[1:52:14] son of man speaking emanating bringing
[1:52:18] forth
[1:52:19] William Branham you're a Son of God you
[1:52:22] are no longer the son of
[1:52:24] Charles and Ella Branham
[1:52:32] he's coming into his place where he's
[1:52:34] now speaking
[1:52:37] he says I've always been troubled my
[1:52:39] whole Ministry
[1:52:41] to speak to this mountain
[1:52:45] he said I've never understood it I
[1:52:47] preached everywhere around in the Bible
[1:52:49] that portion of scripture and I've never
[1:52:51] preached about it
[1:52:55] but watch the sovereignty of that third
[1:52:58] poll every time what was it
[1:53:00] speak the word
[1:53:03] formulated William Branham
[1:53:06] what do you have need of
[1:53:09] squirrels
[1:53:13] I mean to you and I
[1:53:18] squirrels really
[1:53:22] yeah
[1:53:23] what seems to be very minor in Man's
[1:53:27] eyes is very big in Gods
[1:53:31] a little fish
[1:53:34] really
[1:53:37] and yet God's mindful
[1:53:40] and so now
[1:53:42] this young son of man
[1:53:45] is coming to the place
[1:53:48] that when he speaks it's the same as God
[1:53:51] speaking
[1:53:59] Revelation is god making his word known
[1:54:03] to you
[1:54:04] for faith is a revelation faith is
[1:54:07] illumination to your understanding when
[1:54:10] you get it and it opens up to you your
[1:54:13] face lightens up in fact the whole
[1:54:16] Revelation had lit up so much to Moses
[1:54:19] that his countenance
[1:54:22] shown with brightness
[1:54:25] and they said build yourself
[1:54:30] faith is catching what the spirit is
[1:54:32] saying
[1:54:34] faith is the language that God speaks
[1:54:38] regardless of what dialect you were
[1:54:40] raised up
[1:54:42] you have to learn
[1:54:45] a new language
[1:54:47] the language of Heaven
[1:54:50] the language of the Holy Spirit
[1:54:53] and it may sound so foreign to your ear
[1:54:55] huh
[1:54:56] when you learn a new language it's so
[1:54:59] foreign you you speak it you giggle huh
[1:55:05] I remember I asked my friend Freedom how
[1:55:07] do I say to the man at the post office

[1:56:37] well I said well then but that's what
[1:56:40] you taught me
[1:56:41] so I say so how do I tell hey Franken he
[1:56:45] says uh hop and z
[1:56:48] Robinson
[1:56:53] crazy American people
[1:56:56] we force everybody to speak English in
[1:56:59] every country we go to because you know
[1:57:01] what we're lazy
[1:57:04] we make everybody huh you speak English
[1:57:07] you speak English I don't care where you
[1:57:09] go you speak English
[1:57:12] you don't even try in their language
[1:57:16] let me tell you let me give you a hint
[1:57:18] if you ask everybody in any country do
[1:57:21] you speak English most of the time
[1:57:22] they'll say no they they don't but if
[1:57:25] you try in their language
[1:57:28] to speak to them yeah they'll say yeah I
[1:57:31] am fishing yeah a little bit a little
[1:57:33] bit and they'll try to help you
[1:57:38] how many of you
[1:57:40] try to speak
[1:57:43] to your heavenly father
[1:57:50] in a language that he doesn't
[1:57:53] want you to speak in
[1:58:06] Lord help me this morning
[1:58:09] because I have a thought
[1:58:12] that I want to get across to you and my
[1:58:15] speech
[1:58:16] may not be able to have the ability but
[1:58:19] I will say this I will take this broken
[1:58:21] sermon and I will speak it and I will
[1:58:24] let my heavenly father translate it to
[1:58:27] you so that you will understand
[1:58:31] amen
[1:58:34] Hebrews 4 verses 1 through 3 let us
[1:58:37] therefore fear
[1:58:40] lest a promise being less left us of
[1:58:44] entering into his resin any of you
[1:58:46] should seem to come short of it
[1:58:49] For unto us was the Gospel preached as
[1:58:52] well as unto them but the word preached
[1:58:55] did not profit them
[1:58:58] not being mixed with faith in them that
[1:59:01] heard it what good is this message what
[1:59:04] good is 1200 sermons
[1:59:09] what good is to press play and not hear
[1:59:12] what the spirit is saying to the church
[1:59:15] if we're not careful what happens is we
[1:59:18] make it some form of religion and you
[1:59:21] let everyone else you let the prophet
[1:59:24] you let everyone else do your religion
[1:59:27] for you you press play you light the
[1:59:29] candle you plug in the recorder
[1:59:38] no he wants you to talk
[1:59:43] he wants you to speak he wants you to
[1:59:45] say something
[1:59:47] for the spirit and the bride
[1:59:50] didn't say the spirit and the tape
[1:59:52] player
[1:59:56] will the bride have a Ministry before
[1:59:58] the coming of the Lord yep sure uh-huh
[2:00:03] he said it'll be the fivefold ministry
[2:00:06] he said God never used mechanical
[2:00:09] devices to preach the gospel
[2:00:12] probably three to five
[2:00:15] direct quotes
[2:00:17] he said God has always chosen man
[2:00:20] is God's element
[2:00:23] I want all of you to understand that God
[2:00:25] wants to use you he wants to speak to
[2:00:28] you and he wants to have a dialect with
[2:00:32] you and he and he wants you to start
[2:00:34] speaking father I believe your word your
[2:00:37] word is true and you start repeating
[2:00:39] back to him what he is telling you
[2:00:43] and now you have conversation
[2:00:53] Faith doesn't look at symptoms and
[2:00:55] conditions
[2:00:57] Faith looks at the promises of God's
[2:00:59] word otherwise let me tell you
[2:01:01] everything you go through in this life
[2:01:05] all of it is Trials trials here trials
[2:01:07] there if you're not in a trial or you're
[2:01:10] coming out of a trial you're going into
[2:01:12] another one at another time
[2:01:16] trial after trial and the trying of your
[2:01:19] faith is more precious than gold
[2:01:23] I didn't know I needed so much gold
[2:01:28] because there are times when I get so
[2:01:31] tried
[2:01:35] have you ever lost the ability to speak
[2:01:37] to God In Prayer
[2:01:40] when you're hurting
[2:01:47] that you open your mouth
[2:01:50] ah
[2:01:55] have you been there
[2:02:00] it's a language
[2:02:02] the Bible says moanings and groanings
[2:02:07] everything is with a life-giving sound
[2:02:11] what it is there are times
[2:02:13] when you cannot express to your heavenly
[2:02:16] father
[2:02:18] that what you are going through and
[2:02:21] you're unable to speak and a Holy Spirit
[2:02:24] comes and makes intercession
[2:02:30] you ever cried your eyeballs out
[2:02:36] you ever laid on your face before God
[2:02:44] and you're in a trial
[2:02:49] and you don't even know what to pray for
[2:02:52] and you're broken
[2:02:55] foreign
[2:03:00] the essence
[2:03:02] of the flower is when it's crushed
[2:03:09] God took the lily of the valley
[2:03:13] and he crushed him
[2:03:17] in Gethsemane
[2:03:19] there he was
[2:03:22] In The Garden of Gethsemane
[2:03:25] father he was under Such trivial
[2:03:28] to wear sweat and blood mixture come off
[2:03:32] of his forehead
[2:03:34] I don't know if any of you have ever
[2:03:36] been in such travail
[2:03:39] but blood came off of his forehead he
[2:03:43] asked the disciples
[2:03:45] pray with me just want to
[2:03:48] never had he asked that before
[2:03:52] and he goes just a far bit away and he's
[2:03:55] praying and guess what he's in Such
[2:03:57] trivial
[2:03:58] oh God
[2:04:00] let this cup
[2:04:10] the shame the reproach
[2:04:15] father
[2:04:17] let this gut pass for me
[2:04:21] and then at breath
[2:04:25] nevertheless not my will
[2:04:29] what he did is he subjected himself
[2:04:33] I want all of you to understand no
[2:04:35] matter what you go through
[2:04:37] remember he said I will be with you even
[2:04:40] in you until when the end of the world
[2:04:50] Hallelujah
[2:04:53] Faith doesn't look at all of this stuff
[2:04:55] faith is the power to heal you
[2:04:59] faith is the power to deliver you
[2:05:02] faith is the currency that God requires
[2:05:06] to activate the things of Heaven
[2:05:12] wow
[2:05:22] you want to ride the train to Glory
[2:05:27] you'll need a token
[2:05:34] you'll need a token
[2:05:37] that the price has been paid
[2:05:44] Hallelujah somebody's catching it
[2:05:50] foreign
[2:05:53] calling this morning
[2:05:56] God used my voice this morning to speak
[2:05:58] to your people
[2:06:03] Jesus saw potential in the woman
[2:06:07] that she never saw in herself
[2:06:11] God saw her and he called her
[2:06:15] God saw you and he called you
[2:06:21] he saw cleansing
[2:06:25] let me let me put it this way he saw
[2:06:27] seed before cleansing
[2:06:31] he saw seed he saw a potential before
[2:06:36] the tourney
[2:06:45] Jesus
[2:06:46] told her who she was woman
[2:06:51] it is not what she said it's what he
[2:06:54] said you're a daughter of Abraham
[2:06:58] she didn't know
[2:07:02] he saw her and called her
[2:07:06] faith
[2:07:10] isn't evidence that you are
[2:07:13] a Seed of Abraham because Abraham your
[2:07:17] father
[2:07:18] called those things which were not
[2:07:22] as though they were this is not the
[2:07:24] power of positive thinking no sir this
[2:07:27] is able to speak the word this is let me
[2:07:30] tell you I'm claiming what God has told
[2:07:33] me to claim it is me speaking and you
[2:07:36] know what I'm speaking to storms I'm
[2:07:38] speaking to Family I'm speaking to
[2:07:40] sickness I'm speaking to Demons I'm
[2:07:43] telling demon you've got no right get
[2:07:45] off my land

[2:08:06] outdated spiritual Hardware
[2:08:11] majoring on minors
[2:08:15] systems so slow running
[2:08:20] you can't even get anything out of a
[2:08:22] tape or a read your Bible
[2:08:24] why because you're system is so bogged

[2:08:54] some of you have been to church
[2:08:55] [Music]
[2:09:03] I pray that God touch you give you an
[2:09:05] upgrade
[2:09:07] hey man right where you're sitting
[2:09:09] it's what they did on the day of
[2:09:11] Pentecost you know what they all got an
[2:09:12] upgrade why they were under the
[2:09:14] influence of the cloud and God came down
[2:09:17] and he energized every one of them with
[2:09:19] a lick of fire and when he did guess
[2:09:21] what their hard drive
[2:09:33] some of your mental Hardware
[2:09:36] and hard drive is so encumbered
[2:09:40] by your mental
[2:09:43] unbelief
[2:09:50] you need an upgrade
[2:09:53] life is so full of many trials and
[2:09:55] testings
[2:09:57] he didn't say it would be easy
[2:10:01] he said but I'll be with you even in you
[2:10:04] till the end
[2:10:09] it is not the trial that is the problem
[2:10:13] it's your reaction to the problem
[2:10:21] is the cuff the cup half empty or half
[2:10:24] full
[2:10:30] you need an upgrade
[2:10:32] you need to defrag your hard drive
[2:10:39] fragmented up with so much of the
[2:10:41] nonsense of the world
[2:10:45] YouTube and Instagram and Facebook
[2:11:05] are you willing for an upgrade
[2:11:12] are you willing to admit you're a
[2:11:14] failure
[2:11:18] are you um are you
[2:11:21] willing to admit
[2:11:24] that you don't know how to speak like
[2:11:26] you should
[2:11:31] I'm going to confess to you
[2:11:34] I'm a failure
[2:11:45] I'm a failure
[2:11:50] and when I tried to do good
[2:11:54] evil is present with me and then which I
[2:11:58] want to do I don't do
[2:12:01] I got so broken yesterday
[2:12:08] crushed
[2:12:10] crushed
[2:12:14] I told someone if I could run I would
[2:12:16] run
[2:12:18] I said I've got to preach tomorrow
[2:12:28] I tried to find
[2:12:31] I tried to find something
[2:12:36] God what do I say
[2:12:40] because I'm broken I'm a failure
[2:12:47] I can't help anyone I realize if I've
[2:12:51] ever preached something that pricked
[2:12:53] your heart it was because I yielded to
[2:12:56] him
[2:13:01] all right
[2:13:10] when Jesus discerned her heart
[2:13:14] told her who she was immediately she got
[2:13:16] an up upgrade
[2:13:18] her revelation of who she was loosed her
[2:13:22] from her infirmities of what she was
[2:13:25] unto who she was
[2:13:28] you're a daughter
[2:13:32] she was free from the bondage of her own
[2:13:35] mind
[2:13:37] she's thought so little of herself
[2:13:41] she accepted her infirmities as a way to
[2:13:44] punish her listen to this
[2:13:46] for having done wrong
[2:13:49] she was doing Penance for her sins
[2:13:53] some of you are extremely good Catholics
[2:13:59] and you've done wrong and you don't
[2:14:01] forgive yourself
[2:14:04] I got a word for you this morning
[2:14:08] I got a word for you this morning from
[2:14:10] your heavenly father
[2:14:14] you quit beating yourself up
[2:14:17] from your past failures because God is
[2:14:20] more concerned of your present loyalty
[2:14:22] than of your past failures
[2:14:25] somebody say Amen
[2:14:28] Watch Me O God cleanse me cleanse me
[2:14:32] from my own mind cleanse me from my own
[2:14:35] thinking cleanse me from my own bondage
[2:14:39] which holds me back
[2:14:43] ah
[2:14:52] so some of you are allowing Satan to
[2:14:55] bind you in all kinds
[2:14:57] of infirmities
[2:15:00] because you have never earned the right
[2:15:04] for your deliverance
[2:15:08] for your healing
[2:15:10] for you're losing
[2:15:14] he sent his word
[2:15:17] and it healed the people
[2:15:23] father I am asking you to send
[2:15:26] the word the logos thought of God
[2:15:30] to your people
[2:15:32] And yet when they heard these words the
[2:15:36] Holy Ghost fell apart
[2:15:43] have you noticed that here in the last
[2:15:46] couple years they get all this stuff
[2:15:48] about classified document
[2:15:52] what
[2:15:53] ah Trump had some classified documents
[2:15:58] and all everybody
[2:16:01] impeach you classify a document in Mara
[2:16:05] Del Lago there was he had it out you go
[2:16:08] Trump
[2:16:11] so now they find
[2:16:13] classified documents
[2:16:16] wow now Biden huh
[2:16:23] I'm not here to preach about politics
[2:16:25] but I'm going to tell you right now
[2:16:27] foreign
[2:16:29] I got classified documents in my home
[2:16:35] [Music]
[2:16:39] they're all over my home they're in my
[2:16:42] car
[2:16:45] everywhere I go I leave evidence of
[2:16:48] classified documents it is an encrypted
[2:16:51] message that only the elect
[2:16:55] somebody say Amen have you got
[2:16:58] classified documents
[2:17:03] top secret don't tell nobody
[2:17:20] faith
[2:17:23] because guess what it's not public
[2:17:25] information
[2:17:27] the public won't get it
[2:17:29] so if you don't get it you must be a
[2:17:31] publican
[2:17:35] amen
[2:17:39] it's not public no it's not a public
[2:17:41] show
[2:17:42] God don't clown around for nobody
[2:17:45] it's encrypted
[2:17:49] faith will cause
[2:17:52] the believer to rise above the
[2:17:54] conditions around you
[2:17:58] it'll cause you to rise above the
[2:18:00] nonsense
[2:18:02] that is taught in the schools critical
[2:18:05] race Theory
[2:18:07] there's more racism in America today
[2:18:10] than it was when they just had gotten
[2:18:12] rid of slavery
[2:18:16] why because the conditions are getting
[2:18:18] worse
[2:18:20] there's only one group that doesn't have
[2:18:22] racism that's the bride of Christ
[2:18:26] there isn't either June or Gentile Brawn
[2:18:28] or fear no black no white no red no
[2:18:31] yellow what it is it's all in Christ why
[2:18:34] because they are his seed
[2:18:39] amen amen
[2:18:43] you gotta rise above your problems until
[2:18:45] you catch a revelation of Who You Are
[2:18:49] prodigal son had to come to himself one
[2:18:51] day
[2:18:54] when he realized he don't belong there
[2:18:56] when you begin to realize you don't
[2:18:58] belong there
[2:18:59] it's when he came to himself what was it
[2:19:01] he heard from us theophany
[2:19:06] if you learn to accept your
[2:19:07] circumstances that surround you
[2:19:10] you will forsake your own Deliverance
[2:19:15] how about Jonah in the belly of the
[2:19:16] whale you talk about a bad circumstance
[2:19:23] seaweed wrapped you know this is not
[2:19:25] Walt Disney with him floating with a
[2:19:28] candle

[2:19:39] acids of a wheel

[2:19:47] and guess what he turns how does he know
[2:19:51] to turn towards Jerusalem
[2:19:54] you know what he did he says oh I know
[2:19:56] that if I will turn my face towards
[2:19:58] Jerusalem so he probably if he could
[2:20:00] have he turned his face it's probably in
[2:20:03] this direction guess what the whale did

[2:22:10] send somebody else
[2:22:13] I seen down the road man hey
[2:22:17] the easiest part of of
[2:22:20] pastoring a church is preaching because
[2:22:22] that's a gift
[2:22:24] okay
[2:22:25] the rest of it is putting up with
[2:22:27] everybody else

[2:24:00] when Jesus looked at the woman he called
[2:24:03] her he loosed her from her infirmities
[2:24:05] he loosed her from her own mental
[2:24:08] perception
[2:24:09] when you think of yourself as a loser
[2:24:12] you're a loser
[2:24:15] you keep yourself from your true
[2:24:17] identity and your true self and it keeps
[2:24:20] itself locked away from you because you

[2:24:26] son of God

[2:24:35] never able to straighten up in life
[2:24:40] never allow yourself to rise above your
[2:24:43] own failures

[2:25:22] we're not
[2:25:24] to use the pulpit as a whipping post
[2:25:28] we don't need Ministries that want to
[2:25:30] bind us into the legality of church
[2:25:33] order

[2:26:13] there cannot be another kingdom to come
[2:26:16] into until this one gets out of the way
