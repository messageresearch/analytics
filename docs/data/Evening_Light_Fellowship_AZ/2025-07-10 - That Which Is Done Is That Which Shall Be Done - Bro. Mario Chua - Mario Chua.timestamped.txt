[8:17] Amen.
[8:18] Sure am thankful he brought me through
[8:20] that fire. Amen.
[8:24] So many times I've questioned
[8:27] certain circumstances
[8:31] or things I could not understand.
[8:38] Well, many times in trials,
[8:42] weakness blurs my vision and my
[8:46] frustration
[8:47] gets so out of hand.
[8:52] Well, it's then I am reminded
[8:56] I've never been forsaken.
[9:00] I've never had to stand the test alone.
[9:06] And as I look at all the victories,
[9:11] the spirit rises up in me. And it's
[9:14] through the fire my weaknesses
[9:18] made strong.
[9:22] He never promised that the cross would
[9:26] not get heavy,
[9:28] that the hill would not be hard to
[9:32] climb.
[9:34] He never offered
[9:38] a victory without fighting. But he said
[9:42] help would always come in time.
[9:48] Well, just remember when you're standing
[9:52] in the valley of decision
[9:56] and the adversary says give in.
[10:01] Just hold on.
[10:05] Our Lord will show up
[10:09] and he will take you through the fire
[10:12] again. He never promised again. Oh, he
[10:17] never promised that the cross would not
[10:21] get heavy, that the hill would not
[10:25] become too high.
[10:29] [Music]
[10:31] He never offered
[10:34] victories without fighting. But he said
[10:37] help would always come in time.
[10:42] So just remember when standing in the
[10:47] valley of decision
[10:50] and the adversary says give in.
[10:56] Just hold on.
[11:00] Our Lord will show up
[11:03] and he will take you through the fire
[11:07] again. Just hold on. Well, just hold on.
[11:13] Our Lord will show up
[11:16] and he will take you through the fire
[11:21] again.
[11:23] Amen. Give him a hand clap of praise
[11:24] this evening.
[11:27] Amen. Sure am thankful he brought us
[11:30] through that fire and he is going to
[11:31] continue.
[11:33] Amen. If our brother John Duncan could
[11:35] come open our service in a word of
[11:37] prayer. We only have one prayer request
[11:40] written down tonight. Uh it doesn't say
[11:42] who it's from, but we we have it written
[11:44] here. Please pray for Lawson and his
[11:47] family. He got into a freak accident in
[11:49] his home gym. He's been at the hospital
[11:52] since Sunday sedated. Doctors are
[11:54] worried he might have brain damage. He
[11:56] is still on ventilator support. Lawson
[11:59] is only 13 years old. So, let's remember
[12:03] this this Lawson. We also have a prayer
[12:06] report. This is for brother Kelly
[12:07] McMillan. We want to thank the Lord. He
[12:09] had a successfully successful surgery,
[12:12] 12 hours long and very intense surgery
[12:14] and he'll be in recovery for 10 to 12
[12:17] days. So, let's just keep him in prayer
[12:19] and just thankful that the surgery went

[12:43] Yes, you do.
[12:43] Lord, we thank you, Lord, for the fire.
[12:47] Purge us, Lord God. Cleanse us, Lord. We
[12:51] don't always understand what's going on,
[12:53] Lord God. And
[12:56] may all always feel good, Lord, but we
[12:58] know, Lord, that undying
[13:00] love in us, Lord, that you put in us,
[13:02] Lord God, to stand there, Lord God, to
[13:04] love you. I know it's your love, Lord

[13:09] Father. Lord,

[13:16] Yes, Lord. We're here because of you,
[13:18] Lord God, to lift you up, Lord.
[13:21] And you have your precious way, Lord.
[13:24] Those who have been mentioned, Lord God,
[13:27] and the needs, Lord God, we know that
[13:30] you are a miracle working God. Once
[13:34] again, you are right on time, God. Lord,

[13:38] according to your will, Lord God.
[13:42] good pleasure, Lord God, and your
[13:45] purpose. Lord, we commit this service in
[13:48] your hands. May you bless
[13:51] Brother Warren. You strengthen him,
[13:53] Lord.
[13:54] May you help him, Lord. You give us all
[13:57] that gift, Lord God, to get ourselves
[13:59] out of the way that you might be
[14:00] manifest in our lives,
[14:02] your will be accomplished.
[14:04] Amen.

[14:06] things for your glory and honor. Amen.
[14:09] Praise the Lord.

[23:48] longing just to bring
[23:51] something that's worth that will bless
[23:55] your heart.
[23:59] I'll bring you more than a song.
[24:03] For a song in itself is not what you

[24:12] You search much deeper within.
[24:16] Through the way things appear. You're
[24:19] looking into my heart.
[24:25] I'm coming back to the heart of worship

[24:37] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made
[24:42] it. When it's all about you,
[24:46] it's all about you, Jesus.
[24:56] King of endless world.
[25:00] No one could express how much you
[25:04] deserve.
[25:09] Though I'm weak and poor,
[25:12] all I have is yours. Every single
[25:16] breath. Would you do this this evening?
[25:20] I'll bring you more than a song.
[25:24] For a song in itself is not what you
[25:28] have required.
[25:33] You search much deeper within.
[25:36] Through the way things appear, you're
[25:39] looking into my heart.
[25:45] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[25:50] And it's all about you.
[25:54] It's all about you, Jesus.
[25:57] I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I made.

[26:28] And it's all about you.
[26:32] It's all about you, Jesus.
[26:38] [Music]
[26:44] We're so grateful, Lord, tonight
[26:49] and so blessed to be in your presence,
[26:51] Lord.
[26:53] We thank you, Lord, that we can come
[26:54] before your throne tonight, Lord,
[26:58] and have communion with you, Lord.
[27:00] We're longing to hear from you, Lord,
[27:02] tonight
[27:03] to re to lift up our faith, Lord.
[27:07] We want you to bring where you want us
[27:10] to be, Lord God, according to your
[27:12] program. And we ask you, Lord, to be
[27:15] with us. Speak into our heart, Lord.
[27:17] Strengthen our faith, Lord.
[27:20] Take away our unbelief in our heart
[27:24] that we may see you face to face
[27:26] tonight, Lord. through the preaching of
[27:29] the word. May you bless each and every
[27:32] one of us, Lord,
[27:34] because our gathering together tonight
[27:36] is all about you, all about your word,
[27:39] all about your promises. Hallelujah. And
[27:42] let your word come into manifestations
[27:45] tonight, Lord. And we commit everything
[27:47] to you in Jesus Christ's name.
[27:50] Amen. And amen.
[27:51] Amen.
[27:52] Amen. So, God bless you, everybody.
[27:54] It's good to be in the house of the Lord
[27:56] tonight. Amen.
[27:58] And I just want to
[28:01] thank each and everyone who remember us
[28:03] in prayer while we were in uh Canada in
[28:06] Ottawa.
[28:08] So it was uh really a supernatural
[28:11] gathering although a small group of
[28:13] people but the presence of the Lord came
[28:15] down
[28:16] and uh some of the brethren are coming
[28:20] from the Jesus is Lord group. Some are
[28:23] charismatic
[28:25] but when they were caught up by the by
[28:27] the anointing of the preaching of the
[28:29] word
[28:31] so they said it's all different and
[28:33] decided to be in church
[28:36] hallelujah
[28:36] this coming Sunday and maybe some of
[28:38] them are streaming
[28:40] and u what I heard about their testimony
[28:44] because some came from Montreal some
[28:47] came from Toronto
[28:49] some came from uh London Ontario area.
[28:53] So they travel, some of them travel 6
[28:55] hours, some 4 hours, some 2 hours. So
[28:59] the meet and greet plan became a
[29:03] supernatural gathering.
[29:05] So we have two services Saturday and
[29:08] Sunday and uh they came from different
[29:11] churches and they have different
[29:13] testimony.
[29:14] That's how by the way they testify about
[29:19] the church that they went to. the more I
[29:21] appreciate our pastor, brother Ron.
[29:23] Amen.
[29:24] Cuz
[29:26] and uh and I feel uh really
[29:29] so if you're worldly, you can be proud.
[29:32] Cuz our ministry here is so balanced.
[29:35] Amen. Thank you.
[29:36] And I appreciate brother one so much
[29:39] and uh they I think they are streaming
[29:41] tonight too. So God bless you Ottawa
[29:44] brethren and may the Lord bless you
[29:47] tonight and uh let's go directly to the
[29:50] word of God. This will be a short
[29:52] thought that God put in my heart and I
[29:55] trust that you will encourage each and
[29:57] every one of us tonight.
[29:58] Amen.
[29:59] So in the book of Ecclesiastes chapter 1
[30:02] verse 9 a very familiar scripture.
[30:06] So Ecclesiastes is a book
[30:12] after the book of Proverbs.
[30:23] Amen. So it says here in chapter 1 verse
[30:25] 9, the thing that had been it is that we
[30:29] shall be and that and that which is done
[30:33] is that which shall be done and there is
[30:36] no new thing under the sun.
[30:39] Amen. So my title tonight is that which
[30:42] is done is that which shall be done.
[30:45] So in other words, what happened then is
[30:48] still happening now.
[30:49] Amen.
[30:50] Because the word is governed by the word
[30:52] of God. So it always revolved around the
[30:55] word of God.
[30:56] That's right.
[30:56] And the word of God is always in
[30:58] harmony.
[31:00] It's in the word of God is a law
[31:02] and the law of God cannot be changed.
[31:04] That's right.
[31:05] For he never changed his mind about his
[31:06] word.
[31:07] Amen.
[31:07] So what happened then? still happens
[31:09] now.
[31:10] So we will look at some of the scripture
[31:14] and we know that God never changed his
[31:17] program still the same. We may different
[31:20] in uh dispensation in ages in season and
[31:24] time but the character characteristic of
[31:27] how he moved upon his people is still
[31:30] the same.
[31:31] Amen.
[31:32] Amen. So let's bow our head once again.
[31:36] Heavenly Father, we thank you for the
[31:38] word that we've read, Lord, and we just
[31:40] anoint the word and magnify it among us,
[31:42] Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And
[31:45] amen. So, you may be seated tonight.
[31:49] Amen. So, we're so blessed to be in the
[31:51] house of the Lord tonight. Amen.
[31:53] That's right. And as I said a while ago
[31:56] that
[31:58] I am so blessed that
[32:02] we witnessed the prophecy being
[32:05] fulfilled once again in our generation.
[32:07] No,
[32:07] the latest that was fulfilled was the
[32:10] pope coming from America.
[32:13] But it seems that everybody is focused
[32:15] about the pope in America.
[32:18] But the next and I want you to focus on
[32:21] the next paragraph. I don't have it. But
[32:23] the next paragraph is that when the pope
[32:26] arrives, there will be a gathering of
[32:29] all the so-called bride of Jesus Christ
[32:32] and they will be cemented by the love of
[32:35] God. And I believe we are trying to the
[32:37] that that prophecy is also beginning to
[32:40] come to pass.
[32:41] Not only the pope come to pass, but I
[32:43] believe that the cemented
[32:46] on the fellowship of the bride is coming
[32:48] together right now. And I see when I
[32:50] went to Ottawa, it's the differences.
[32:52] They forget about the differences. They
[32:54] just want to hear the word of God.
[32:57] And I believe that the time has come
[32:59] that this prophecy must fulfilled among
[33:01] us. No more divisions, no more do this,
[33:04] no more do this. We are coming into the
[33:06] unity of the word of God in these last
[33:08] days.
[33:08] Hallelujah.
[33:09] Amen. So I just want to take uh the
[33:13] story of Daniel
[33:15] chapter 6. what happened to Daniel will
[33:18] be happening in our day.
[33:21] Uh turn with me in the book of Daniel
[33:23] chapter
[33:25] 6. I think we will uh just read the
[33:28] whole chapter.
[33:30] Daniel chapter 6. We'll start in verse
[33:33] one.
[33:38] So we will get some nuggets and the
[33:40] things that happened to Daniel. And I
[33:43] believe it's the same will be happening
[33:44] to us.
[33:45] Amen. because it's just like a prophecy
[33:49] or a mystery hidden in the Bible. But we
[33:52] know that the Bible has become a new
[33:54] Bible when the seal was opened.
[33:56] So we look at in different way not in
[33:59] the denominational uh
[34:02] uh understanding but through the
[34:05] understanding
[34:06] of the open book. Verse one, it pleased
[34:10] Darius to set over the kingdom and 120
[34:14] peace princes which should be over the
[34:16] whole kingdom and over these three
[34:19] president of whom Daniel was the first
[34:23] that the princes might give account unto
[34:25] and the king should have no damage.
[34:29] And Daniel was prepared above the
[34:32] president and princes because an
[34:34] excellent spirit was in him. So in these
[34:37] last days we have as a Christian we have
[34:40] a different spirit and we are
[34:44] as I went to the Italy with the brothers
[34:48] Christian are prepared prepared compared
[34:51] to others.
[34:52] Amen.
[34:53] Because Christian have a good spirit in
[34:56] them.
[34:57] So some of the brothers they work in uh
[35:00] one of the prominent families or big
[35:02] businessmen and they were the people
[35:05] that sometimes manage and they will be
[35:08] trusted.
[35:09] So they were prepared above all others.
[35:11] And I believe each and every one of us
[35:13] the same thing in our works in school
[35:16] maybe in whatever
[35:18] uh situation we are in we are more
[35:21] prepared
[35:22] because of a kind spirit.
[35:24] Amen. But anyway, the word of God said
[35:27] those who are blessed,
[35:31] Abraham's seed will be blessed.
[35:33] Amen.
[35:34] If you notice, if in in in your work, in
[35:37] your school,
[35:39] the more you work, the more your
[35:42] employer will be blessed because there
[35:45] is a spirit among us. Amen. Amen.
[35:48] And even in Italy they they prefer some
[35:51] of the Christian because some of the the
[35:55] the employers and not don't really stay
[35:59] in their home. So those brother are
[36:02] there the one who take care of all the
[36:05] businesses and all of that and uh they
[36:08] were prepared. Sometimes they work some
[36:11] 20 years, some 30 years and they want to
[36:13] resign but their boss don't want them to
[36:15] resign.
[36:17] Amen.
[36:17] Because the quality of a Christian life
[36:20] is different from others.
[36:21] Because we work not for to to attract
[36:24] our employee but we work
[36:27] to God. Amen.
[36:28] So we're pleasing God in our work.
[36:30] Yes sir. That's why after the service
[36:32] during that time we have a
[36:35] a brother took some time off and drove
[36:39] us around the countryside. So we travel
[36:43] from France then we went to Switzerland
[36:46] in Geneva. Not only are working a small
[36:49] company but there are so brothers that
[36:51] working in a big company big
[36:53] organizations and one of the brothers
[36:56] work work in WIPO which is worth
[36:59] intellectual property organization.
[37:03] So he tore us around the offices and he
[37:05] show us oh this is the office of the
[37:08] United Nations. This is the office of
[37:09] the Red Cross. This is the office of the
[37:11] word council of churches. and he said
[37:13] that there are believers working in the
[37:16] word council of churches and we are so
[37:18] excited. Oh, we want to go there. So, we
[37:20] drove going to that uh to the office but
[37:23] fortunately unfortunately it was closed.
[37:27] So, we can see that as a Christian we
[37:30] are not only a small people. God will
[37:33] elevate each and every one of us because
[37:35] we are now living in the last days.
[37:37] God is trying to elevate our life. Not
[37:39] only as a Christian we are so poor we
[37:42] are just pity. No God is lifting up.
[37:45] Amen.
[37:46] Because they preferred Christian
[37:47] compares to others.
[37:49] Amen.
[37:49] That's right.
[37:50] So
[37:52] verse four. Then the president and the
[37:54] princes sought to find occasion against
[37:56] Daniel concerning the kingdom because
[37:59] Daniel was a trustworthy person. He was
[38:01] prepared by the king. So even when you
[38:04] do good things
[38:06] there will always be someone who will go
[38:08] against you.
[38:11] He was led by the king. He got the
[38:13] priorities given to them. Then the
[38:15] president the princess sought to find
[38:17] occasion against Daniel concerning the
[38:19] kingdom.
[38:22] But they could not but they could not
[38:25] find none occasion for fault.
[38:28] For as much as he was faithful, neither
[38:30] was there any error or fault found in
[38:32] him.
[38:34] Somebody is trying if you do good,
[38:36] somebody's trying to kill your
[38:37] influence. But what did Daniel do? He
[38:40] humbled himself.
[38:42] He didn't look at the criticism around
[38:44] him. He just take the mind of God,
[38:48] take the thought of God because your
[38:50] thought become your word.
[38:52] That's right.
[38:53] And your word become your action and
[38:55] your action become your habit.
[38:57] Yes, sir. So he see to it that he was
[38:59] always in the mind of God in in prayer.
[39:02] So you don't need to say oh I am a
[39:05] Christian I no because our action
[39:10] yes sir
[39:11] what do you call that action speak
[39:13] louder than your word.
[39:14] Amen.
[39:15] So whatever your thought will become
[39:16] word and your word become action. But if
[39:18] your thought always on the mind of God
[39:20] the word of God your action will do the
[39:22] same.
[39:23] And likewise we are doing the same
[39:25] thing. So that's why everybody is trying
[39:27] to criticize the to throw any kind of
[39:30] word but stay online or stay in line
[39:33] with the word of God. Let the mind of
[39:36] God be in you. The mind which is the
[39:38] word of God.
[39:39] And and the scripture said you need to
[39:41] pray without ceasing.
[39:44] Amen.
[39:45] Even if you're working, you're still
[39:47] praying.
[39:48] Even if you are uh driving, you can
[39:51] still pray.
[39:52] Amen. Pray without ceasing. The more you
[39:54] pray, the more you meditate, the more
[39:57] word that come into your heart, the more
[40:00] word that coming out of your mouth.
[40:03] You don't need to testify, oh, I am a
[40:04] Christian. I am do this, I don't drink,
[40:06] I don't smoke. No.
[40:09] They don't care about whether you smoke
[40:12] or not.
[40:13] It is your life that they're looking.
[40:15] That's right. If you meditate upon the
[40:17] word of God in the mind of God, you
[40:19] become a living epistle read of all men.
[40:24] That's right.
[40:25] Because the way you act, the way you the
[40:28] way you you you you put things,
[40:32] they cannot question it. So we can see
[40:35] they find occasion against Daniel
[40:37] concerning the kingdom, but they could
[40:40] not find none occasion for fault for as
[40:42] much as he was faithful. So you need to
[40:44] be faithful.
[40:46] Amen.
[40:47] Faithfulness is the key.
[40:50] Neither was there any error or fault
[40:52] found in him.
[40:54] So in Philippians chapter 2:5, let this
[40:56] mind be new which was also in Christ.
[40:59] What is the mind? It's the word of God.
[41:02] Always meditate on the word of God.
[41:05] Do not entertain criticism because if
[41:08] you know who you are, I don't care what
[41:10] they anybody else says. I am a failure
[41:13] in myself but I believe God. I love God
[41:15] and I don't care whatever they say. I am
[41:17] not molded by their criticism.
[41:21] We are molded by the word of God that is
[41:23] being revealed to us. Amen.
[41:25] Hallelujah. 2 Corinthians 3:2. Ye are
[41:27] epistle written to all in our hearts
[41:30] known and read of all men.
[41:33] Praise be to God. Turn in chap verse 5.
[41:37] Then said this man, we shall not find
[41:39] any occasion against this Daniel except
[41:43] we find it against him concerning the
[41:48] law of his God.
[41:51] So they're trying to find fault upon you
[41:55] cannot find fault in his
[41:57] in his manifestation in his life. So
[42:00] what they're trying to do is he said
[42:01] that except we find against him
[42:05] concerning the law of his God. So the
[42:08] only chance to hurt Daniel and to
[42:10] destroy Daniel was to change the law of
[42:13] the land
[42:16] against what Daniel believed and obey
[42:20] and to attach a death penalty to anyone
[42:24] who broke the law.
[42:26] So the word of God is a law that cannot
[42:28] be changed. Amen.
[42:30] So in Daniel chapter 6, he said, "Then
[42:32] this president and princes assemble
[42:35] together to the king.
[42:37] There will be a uniting time, uniting of
[42:40] the word council of churches, uniting of
[42:42] the government, uniting of political
[42:45] everything."
[42:46] Amen.
[42:48] And thus said unto him, King Darius,
[42:50] live forever.
[42:54] So look at the the flatteries.
[42:57] Live forever, oh king. You are the
[42:58] greatest. You are the most powerful. Oh
[43:01] king.
[43:06] But per but be careful
[43:10] when somebody gives you a flattery.
[43:13] Amen.
[43:15] Because behind this flattery there is a
[43:17] motive and objective.
[43:20] Amen.
[43:21] So we don't need the flatteries of men.
[43:24] True. We are here to please God, not to
[43:27] please men. We don't need flatteries.
[43:30] Flattery is good, but we need the C or
[43:33] something.
[43:36] And
[43:38] but their real motives and purpose to
[43:41] get their own way.
[43:44] And look at where all this began. Why
[43:48] they're trying to put down? What is the
[43:50] reason behind?
[43:52] So it was
[43:54] a simple jealousy.
[43:58] It began with a spirit of jealousy in
[44:00] their hearts against faithful and
[44:02] innocent men. Verse seven, all the
[44:05] president of the kingdom, the governors
[44:07] and the princes, the counselors, the
[44:09] captains
[44:11] have consulted together to establish
[44:13] royal statue and to make a firm decree
[44:17] that whosoever shall ask a petition of
[44:20] any
[44:22] god or man for 30 days save of thee, oh
[44:26] king, he shall be cast into the den of
[44:30] the lion. There is only one man, one
[44:33] leadership that they want.
[44:37] Now, oh king, establish a decree and
[44:39] sign the writing that it be not changed
[44:41] according to the law of medicine and
[44:43] Persian which alter it not. Wherefore
[44:46] king Darius sign the writing and a
[44:48] decree. Amen. So there is a decree being
[44:52] released that no man
[44:55] will worship any other god except King
[44:58] Darius.
[45:00] one man government, one oneway church
[45:02] and all it will be happening. There will
[45:06] be a word churches of council of
[45:08] churches gathering together and they
[45:09] want one government, one religion, one
[45:12] word government.
[45:13] Amen.
[45:16] Wherefore King Darius signed the writing
[45:18] and the decree and we know that the law
[45:21] of medicine persian was written and
[45:23] signed could not be changed.
[45:26] And we also know that the word of God
[45:27] cannot be changed either. Amen.
[45:31] Psalm chapter uh 119:89 it says,
[45:34] "Forever, O Lord, thy word is settled in
[45:38] heaven."
[45:39] So it cannot get altered. It's already
[45:41] being settled even before the foundation
[45:43] of the word. Amen. And you cannot add
[45:45] into it and you cannot take away into
[45:47] it. You cannot add your interpretation.
[45:49] Praise God. Because the word of God is
[45:51] already settled in heaven.
[45:53] Hallelujah. So that's why those who
[45:54] believe the word of God has already
[45:56] peace and rest because of the settled
[45:59] word of God.
[46:00] Amen.
[46:00] Amen. Everything is revolving around the
[46:03] promises of God.
[46:05] Yes, sir.
[46:06] Amen. And to settle means to bring to
[46:09] rest, to establish permanently.
[46:12] Amen. Matthew chapter 24:35, he said,
[46:15] "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but
[46:17] my word shall not pass away." That's
[46:19] right.
[46:20] So, we see that
[46:25] We see that there is a secret that lays
[46:28] in this story to show us how the devil
[46:30] uses this strategy
[46:33] many times to try to destroy the people
[46:35] of God.
[46:38] These wicked men knew that the only way
[46:40] to destroy Daniel was to cause the king
[46:43] to sign an unchangeable law.
[46:47] That the penalty was death if that law
[46:50] was disobeyed.
[46:53] And they also knew that Daniel would be
[46:55] forced by his belief to choose between
[46:58] the law of God and the law of men.
[47:00] Amen.
[47:01] So that is the pressure that is coming
[47:02] in.
[47:04] The time has come that they will decree
[47:08] that everybody will want and if you
[47:10] cannot join it, you cannot buy or sell.
[47:13] So that is the strategy. They changed
[47:16] the law.
[47:19] Amen. to destroy
[47:22] our belief
[47:24] right
[47:25] and faith in God.
[47:28] So this was a trap that they thought was
[47:30] foolproof that would destroy Daniel.
[47:33] This is what the bride is going to face
[47:35] before things are over because this has
[47:37] always been the strategy of the devil.
[47:42] This politician couldn't destroy
[47:45] Daniel directly.
[47:48] So they created the law that could not
[47:50] be changed for the purpose to trap him
[47:52] into breaking the law.
[47:56] So Satan is a strategist.
[48:00] He know how to manipulate.
[48:02] Amen.
[48:02] He's subject.
[48:05] So this is the same trick that Satan
[48:07] used in the beginning to bring death
[48:10] into the human race.
[48:12] So let's turn in Genesis chapter 2:1 16.
[48:17] uh Genesis chapter 2 verse 16. And the
[48:20] Lord had commanded the man, saying, "Of
[48:24] every tree of the garden, thou may yes
[48:27] freely eat,
[48:30] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[48:32] and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, for
[48:33] the day that eatth thereof, thou shalt
[48:36] not thou shalt surely die." That's the
[48:39] conditional covenant of God. You may eat
[48:41] of the tree but not of the tree of
[48:43] knowledge good and evil but because with
[48:45] the day you eat thereof the day you
[48:47] shall die. That is the law of God and
[48:50] cannot be changed.
[48:52] Cannot be altered.
[48:54] Amen.
[48:55] So Satan couldn't
[48:57] directly hurt Eve in the garden of Eden.
[49:02] So the only way he could destroy her
[49:05] was to get to break a law that could not
[49:08] be changed. A law that if broken had a
[49:11] penalty of death attached to it
[49:14] because the day you eat thereof, the day
[49:16] you die.
[49:17] That's right.
[49:20] Satan is so good.
[49:23] Good strategies. So, Satan's only chance
[49:26] of victory was somehow to get Eve to
[49:29] destroy the law of God. And then God
[49:32] himself would be forced by his own law
[49:36] because his word cannot be altered. the
[49:38] day you eat thereof, the day you die.
[49:40] Amen.
[49:41] To destroy his own children whom he
[49:43] loved, just like King Darius was forced
[49:45] to destroy and whom he loved. So God is
[49:48] trying to fulfill his law.
[49:51] Satan knew that the word of God was a
[49:53] law that could not be changed. Eve
[49:54] didn't know that, but Satan knows about
[49:58] it.
[50:00] He hadn't been around long enough to
[50:02] learn that properly. And that is the
[50:04] same problem. Will the multitude of
[50:06] so-called Christians today?
[50:08] That's right.
[50:09] They do not realize that God's word is
[50:11] like a law that can never under any
[50:14] circumstances be changed.
[50:16] Amen.
[50:18] So we need to be careful. There is a
[50:20] law.
[50:20] The word of God is a law. Whatever you
[50:23] saw,
[50:24] one seed, you will reap a thousand
[50:26] seeds.
[50:30] So look at the inspiration of the devil
[50:33] that came upon these wicked men. All
[50:36] they had to do was get Daniel to break
[50:39] just one single law that couldn't be
[50:41] changed. And in if that law had a death
[50:44] penalty attached to it, then that was
[50:47] the end of the
[50:49] simple just a simple just twist of the
[50:54] word of God.
[50:56] So continue on in Daniel 6
[51:00] chapter 10. Now when Daniel knew that
[51:03] the writing was signed,
[51:07] now it was the law was being
[51:10] implemented.
[51:12] It was signed. But see Daniel when
[51:15] Daniel knew that the writing was signed,
[51:17] he knew it was already being announced.
[51:21] It was already being in the head news.
[51:25] Right?
[51:26] Instead of panicking,
[51:29] instead of being nervous,
[51:33] instead of worrying too much, the
[51:35] scripture said he went into his house
[51:39] and his windows being open in his
[51:41] chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneel upon
[51:43] his knees three times a day and prayed
[51:46] and gave thanks before his God as he did
[51:49] a poor thing.
[51:50] Amen. So whatever law is being
[51:52] implemented doesn't care for the bride
[51:55] of Jesus Christ because we are focusing
[51:57] on the word promise of God. So we are
[51:59] looking on the promise not on what this
[52:02] constitution being implemented. So
[52:04] that's why when Daniel knew it doesn't
[52:07] matter
[52:08] it just continue what he was going to
[52:11] do. He go there kneel and pray three
[52:13] times. He he was showing it facing
[52:16] Jerusalem.
[52:18] Amen. That's why whatever.
[52:21] So the bride of Jesus Christ don't don't
[52:23] don't be scared of what's happening
[52:25] around us
[52:26] because the scripture was you when you
[52:27] see all these things
[52:29] look up for your redemption is draw at
[52:31] night.
[52:32] Whatever happens around us we have a
[52:34] promise.
[52:36] Hallelujah.
[52:37] Just like Joshua and Caleb when when
[52:40] Moses promised them you I'll give you a
[52:43] promised land. Go to Canaan and spy the
[52:46] land. So when we went there, they saw
[52:48] giant.
[52:51] Caleb and Joshua saw the giant. So is
[52:53] the 10
[52:55] that goes with them saw the same thing.
[52:57] But when they came back,
[53:00] the 10 had a bad report. Oh, we cannot
[53:02] do it because there was already a giant.
[53:06] But Caleb and Joseph said, "We are more
[53:08] than able to conquer it." Because they
[53:10] are not looking at the circumstances.
[53:12] They are looking at the finished promise
[53:14] of God. You will conquer the land
[53:17] irregardless there is a giant. You will
[53:19] conquer that giant because that is his
[53:22] promise.
[53:23] His promise is no limitation.
[53:26] Irregardless there is a giant or no
[53:28] giant whatsoever. Whatever it in the
[53:30] land
[53:33] it was promised to be yours.
[53:36] Look at the promise not look at the
[53:38] circumstances.
[53:39] Just like in our time we have so many
[53:41] circumstances around us. calamity, wars
[53:44] and rumors of war. But we are not among
[53:47] them.
[53:48] We have a promise.
[53:50] When you look at this, look up. Your
[53:51] redemption is drawn nigh. Let us draw
[53:54] our attentions to the promise.
[53:56] Not to the circumstances around us.
[53:58] Circumstances. Hallelujah. They will
[54:00] fulfill according to the prophecy. But
[54:03] there will be the bride that will
[54:04] fulfill a prophecy in a moment in the
[54:06] twinkling of an eye. Hallelujah. Shall
[54:08] be changed.
[54:10] That is the promise that we're looking
[54:11] after. Yes.
[54:13] Amen.
[54:13] Praise God.
[54:14] Not the circumstances.
[54:16] And pray and give thanks before his God
[54:19] as he did a four time.
[54:21] That's right.
[54:23] Nothing matters.
[54:25] You just continue to pray to praise God.
[54:27] Go to church every Sunday, every
[54:28] Wednesday. Amen. Why you go to church?
[54:31] Because you want to recharge.
[54:32] That's right.
[54:33] We are in a picnic. We are not in a
[54:35] picnic. We are in a battle. So we come
[54:37] here to be recharged.
[54:39] Recharge for another battle. recharge
[54:41] for another battle. Amen.
[54:43] Hallelujah. But the battle is always
[54:45] over because we have the promise to
[54:47] conquer the land.
[54:49] So regardless of any circumstances,
[54:52] we have already conquered it.
[54:54] Hallelujah.
[54:57] So Daniel knew very well what these evil
[55:00] men were up to, but he had already
[55:02] purpose in his heart.
[55:03] You need to determine,
[55:06] Amen. that irregardless of what happens,
[55:09] you will purpose in your heart that you
[55:11] will serve him.
[55:12] Amen.
[55:13] Because in Psalms 27:5, it says, "For in
[55:15] the time of trouble, he shall hide me in
[55:18] his pavilion. In the secret of his
[55:21] tabernacle, he shall hide me, and he
[55:23] shall set me up upon the rock."
[55:26] Hallelujah. In times of trouble. And we
[55:28] are now living in the times of trouble.
[55:30] And Daniel is living in time of trouble
[55:32] because there was a constitution being
[55:34] implemented that whosoever
[55:37] worship any other god beside the king
[55:40] will be killed.
[55:43] Amen.
[55:44] But Daniel just continue on
[55:47] because he look at the promise.
[55:49] When the times of trouble come, he will
[55:51] hide me.
[55:53] Thank you.
[55:53] Not the church will hide us. Not the
[55:55] government will protect. He personally
[55:57] will hide us in his pavilion in the
[56:01] secret place. What is the secret place?
[56:02] It is by the revealed word
[56:04] and upon the rock of revelation and
[56:06] revelation is not wisdom on the word. It
[56:09] was the mind of God coming into our
[56:11] mind. So that's why we express the word
[56:13] of God and that is revelation because it
[56:16] was the mind of God coming in.
[56:17] That's right.
[56:21] Hallelujah.
[56:24] So flesh and blood has not revealed this
[56:25] but your heavenly father revealed this.
[56:27] It was the mind of God coming in and
[56:30] reveal his word. So that's why we can
[56:32] express revelation from our heart. Amen.
[56:36] So that's why David in Psalm 27
[56:38] expresses confidence in the Lord's
[56:40] protection and salvation. So that way
[56:44] doesn't matter when they implement the
[56:46] law, you just keep on serving the Lord.
[56:49] Amen.
[56:53] So remember that the law was forbidding
[56:55] the asking of petition from any other
[56:58] god save the king. Trying to force
[57:01] Daniel to come under the headship of a
[57:03] man's provision instead of God's
[57:07] leadership.
[57:10] We will come to that amen later on in
[57:12] our because we have a man with a name of
[57:15] biker of Christ.
[57:19] Uh they call that a vicarious fai which
[57:22] is means the biker of god
[57:24] which means instead of the son of god
[57:26] that's right
[57:27] he will want worship
[57:29] a one man
[57:30] he will
[57:32] and he will fulfill that according to
[57:34] the prophecy
[57:37] that is what will be the same pressure
[57:40] in this our time
[57:41] sir
[57:42] they will try to force us to come under
[57:44] man's provision
[57:47] and headship or we or we won't be able
[57:50] to buy or sell. If you can't buy or
[57:52] sell, then that is effectively a death
[57:54] penalty.
[57:56] But we praise the Lord, we cannot
[57:59] enter in
[58:01] because before it happens, we are ready
[58:05] in the presence of the Lord.
[58:08] In verse 11, then these men assembled
[58:10] and found Daniel praying and making
[58:12] supplication before his God.
[58:15] They have already CCTV.
[58:18] They can monitor wherever you want.
[58:20] So in a our presentation even though you
[58:24] don't have anything but they can as long
[58:26] as you have a cell phone
[58:28] they can trace you anywhere you are.
[58:32] So we cannot run away from persecution
[58:34] if that comes.
[58:39] And they, verse 12, and they came near
[58:42] and spake before the king concerning the
[58:44] king's decree.
[58:47] Hast thou not sign a decree that every
[58:49] man that shall ask a petition of any god
[58:51] or man within 30 days? Save of thee, O
[58:55] king shall be cast into the den of
[58:57] lions. And the king answered, the king,
[59:00] the thing is true according to the law
[59:02] of medicine and Persian, which alternat.
[59:05] Once it is written, you cannot alter the
[59:08] law of medicine. Persian. Then answered
[59:11] they and said before the king that
[59:12] Daniel
[59:17] that bromite
[59:20] which always preaching from a dead man's
[59:23] sermon.
[59:25] They don't have any sermon. They don't
[59:26] they are preaching the dead man's
[59:28] sermon. that Brunomite
[59:34] the children of the captivity of Judah
[59:36] regarded not thee, O king, nor the
[59:38] decree that I was signed, but make it
[59:40] his pedition three times a day.
[59:44] Praise the Lord.
[59:45] Amen.
[59:48] So there will be always an accusation
[59:50] coming in.
[59:51] That's right.
[59:52] So that's why we were so excited to go
[59:54] to the word council of churches in
[59:56] Geneva to meet the all the believers and
[59:59] trying to ask is there is there a
[1:00:01] bonamite called in there? Praise God.
[1:00:06] And we can see that then the king when
[1:00:08] he heard his word was sore displeased
[1:00:10] with himself and set his heart on Daniel
[1:00:13] to deliver him and he labored till the
[1:00:16] going down of the sun to deliver him.
[1:00:18] The king labored when he heard about
[1:00:20] Daniel because he loved Daniel so much.
[1:00:25] And we will notice that it happens
[1:00:26] during the evening time.
[1:00:29] This is where all this is where we are
[1:00:32] right now. This is when Satan is sure
[1:00:34] that he will destroy the bride of Christ
[1:00:36] for the last time at the evening time.
[1:00:38] So they gathered together at the evening
[1:00:40] time. So that's why the king cannot
[1:00:43] sleep
[1:00:44] very well. Verse 15. Then these men
[1:00:48] assembled unto the king.
[1:00:51] So look at when they are gathering to
[1:00:53] bring a persecution against Daniel. It
[1:00:55] was in the evening time. So persecution
[1:00:58] this is the evening time.
[1:00:59] True.
[1:01:01] And said unto the king, oh king, that
[1:01:04] the law of Medis and Persian is that no
[1:01:06] decree nor statue which the king
[1:01:09] established may be changed. Then the
[1:01:11] king commanded and they brought Daniel
[1:01:13] and cast him into the den of lion. Now
[1:01:17] the penalty of the law has been carried
[1:01:18] on
[1:01:20] because Daniel has been cast into the
[1:01:22] den of lions. Judgment has been met
[1:01:25] and these wicked men were counting on
[1:01:27] the lions eating Daniel.
[1:01:30] So they were excited.
[1:01:35] Now the king spake and said unto Daniel.
[1:01:39] So the king prophesied to Daniel,
[1:01:42] thy God whom thou servest continually
[1:01:45] and he will deliver thee.
[1:01:47] Amen.
[1:01:49] Amen. Now at the same time there was a
[1:01:51] prophetic voice of a king present to
[1:01:52] encourage Daniel in the lion's den.
[1:01:55] And we have a prophetic voice, the king
[1:01:57] of king. Hallelujah. That will lift us
[1:02:00] our faith
[1:02:02] in times of trouble.
[1:02:03] Thank you Lord. Because the voice of the
[1:02:05] vindicated prophet is to give us hope in
[1:02:08] this day when all the lions from the pit
[1:02:10] are set against us.
[1:02:12] That's right.
[1:02:13] We have a prophetic voice coming in.
[1:02:15] Amen.
[1:02:17] Verse 17. And the stone was brought and
[1:02:19] laid upon the mouth of the den and the
[1:02:21] king seal it with his set and with the
[1:02:24] set of his lords and the purpose might
[1:02:26] not be changed concerning Daniel.
[1:02:29] So it is already sealed.
[1:02:31] Even though how much Daniel begged,
[1:02:35] oh I how much Daniel beg, but the law
[1:02:38] must be implemented.
[1:02:45] And verse 18, then the king went to his
[1:02:48] palace and passed the night fasting.
[1:02:51] Neither were instrument of music brought
[1:02:53] before him and his sleep went from him.
[1:02:56] So he cannot sleep.
[1:02:59] thinking about Joseph.
[1:03:02] Then the king arose early in the morning
[1:03:05] and went to haste unto the dens of lion.
[1:03:07] And when he came to the den, he cried
[1:03:09] with a lamentable voice unto Daniel. And
[1:03:12] the king spake and said to Daniel, "Oh
[1:03:14] Daniel, servant of the living God."
[1:03:18] So King Darius recognize
[1:03:20] the God of Daniel.
[1:03:22] Amen.
[1:03:23] Amen.
[1:03:24] Oh Daniel, servant of the living God. is
[1:03:26] thy God whom thou servest continually
[1:03:28] able to deliver thee from the lion.
[1:03:31] Amen.
[1:03:31] Then said Daniel and the king, oh king,
[1:03:33] live forever. My God had sent his angel
[1:03:37] and not shut the lion's mouth that they
[1:03:39] were not hurt me. For as much as before
[1:03:41] him innocence was found me and before al
[1:03:45] and also before thee, oh king have I
[1:03:47] done no hurt.
[1:03:49] Amen.
[1:03:51] The God sent in his angel. And according
[1:03:54] to Psalms 34:7, the angel of the Lord
[1:03:56] encamped route about him.
[1:03:59] Amen.
[1:03:59] About them that fear him and delivered
[1:04:02] them.
[1:04:03] Thank you, Lord.
[1:04:03] Hallelujah.
[1:04:05] So the angel control the lion's den.
[1:04:08] But the next step then when the king
[1:04:10] exceedingly glad for him and commanded
[1:04:12] that they should take Daniel up out of
[1:04:15] the den.
[1:04:17] So Daniel was taken up out of the den
[1:04:19] and no matter of hurt was found upon
[1:04:22] him.
[1:04:24] Not even a scratch,
[1:04:27] not anything was found
[1:04:30] because the scripture said because he
[1:04:32] believe in his God.
[1:04:34] Amen.
[1:04:34] Hallelujah. God is able to protect you.
[1:04:37] He will hide you in times of trouble in
[1:04:39] his pavilion.
[1:04:40] Not even a scratch, not even anything.
[1:04:43] Hallelujah.
[1:04:45] Because he because he trusted and
[1:04:47] believe in God. And verse 24, and then
[1:04:50] when the king exceeding glad for him, he
[1:04:52] commanded that they should take Daniel
[1:04:54] up to den and Daniel was taken out of
[1:04:56] the den, and no man of hurt was found
[1:04:58] upon him because he believed in his God.
[1:05:02] Amen.
[1:05:03] And the king commanded, and they brought
[1:05:05] those men which had accused Daniel.
[1:05:09] So this is the consequences now of those
[1:05:12] people that go against
[1:05:14] Daniel.
[1:05:15] That's right. And they cast them into
[1:05:18] the lion's den.
[1:05:20] They were cast into the lion's den.
[1:05:22] Wow.
[1:05:24] So whatever you saw you will reap.
[1:05:26] That's right.
[1:05:27] Not only they and said that and they
[1:05:29] cast into the dens of lion them and
[1:05:32] their children and their wives and the
[1:05:35] lion had the mastery of them.
[1:05:39] Mastery attack them and kill them. Not
[1:05:43] only those wicked politician or men but
[1:05:46] also their wives and their children.
[1:05:50] Imagine that. And break all their bones.
[1:05:55] Break all their bones.
[1:05:59] As long as you have bones, it will
[1:06:01] break. The lion will break your bone
[1:06:03] from the head, from your shoulder,
[1:06:05] everything
[1:06:07] in pieces. wherever they came at the
[1:06:10] bottoms of the den.
[1:06:13] So I want you to take note this. Look at
[1:06:15] what these wicked men brought upon their
[1:06:17] wives and children
[1:06:19] because of what began as a jealousy in
[1:06:22] their heart.
[1:06:22] Amen.
[1:06:24] Amen.
[1:06:26] So it happens to them.
[1:06:28] How about we
[1:06:29] as sons and daughters of God
[1:06:32] as men of God in this hour, we must
[1:06:34] always put God first.
[1:06:37] Amen. Yes sir.
[1:06:40] This is what will bring deliverance
[1:06:42] to our wives, to our children, to our
[1:06:45] family.
[1:06:46] Hallelujah.
[1:06:50] If by going against God, those men
[1:06:52] brought about destructions of their
[1:06:54] wives and children, then by staying with
[1:06:57] the word of God of this hour is what
[1:07:00] will also bring about salvation to our
[1:07:02] wives, our children and our family.
[1:07:04] Hallelujah.
[1:07:05] Hallelujah. It all depends upon the word
[1:07:08] of God.
[1:07:10] Remember that whatever you saw, you will
[1:07:12] weep.
[1:07:13] Not only those wicked men, their
[1:07:15] children, their wives, maybe their
[1:07:16] families are being affected. But if you
[1:07:18] are true to God, then also our family,
[1:07:22] our children and everything.
[1:07:25] God will keep it.
[1:07:29] Verse 25. Then King Dus wrote unto all
[1:07:31] the people, nations, and languages that
[1:07:33] dwell in the earth, peace be multiplied
[1:07:35] unto you. So after the last temptations
[1:07:38] of the bride of this day, and peace will
[1:07:40] reign over the entire earth during the
[1:07:43] millennium because God can never change
[1:07:46] his word.
[1:07:47] So it's better to stay in the word of
[1:07:48] God in these last days,
[1:07:50] not in the men's interpretations or any
[1:07:53] denomination. Let us
[1:07:55] stay in the word with sincerity.
[1:07:58] Amen. Yes.
[1:07:59] Amen. Let us be sincere and be sensitive
[1:08:03] to the leading of the Holy Spirit. That
[1:08:05] is the only way that God will keep us.
[1:08:07] That's right.
[1:08:08] Because if we stay in his word, well,
[1:08:11] God never changed his mind about his
[1:08:12] word.
[1:08:14] Amen.
[1:08:15] So the same tactic and Satan never
[1:08:17] changes tactic too.
[1:08:20] So let us uh take Balam in uh book of
[1:08:24] numbers chapter 24.
[1:08:28] So Balam couldn't directly curse the
[1:08:30] people of God because what God has
[1:08:33] blessed will be blessed what God has
[1:08:34] cursed. So whatever things he do
[1:08:39] and God is also the the curse will turn
[1:08:42] into a blessing because you cannot curse
[1:08:45] whatever God's blessed.
[1:08:46] That's right.
[1:08:47] Amen.
[1:08:48] So that's why if you want to be blessed,
[1:08:50] bless somebody. Amen.
[1:08:53] Don't say bad things about somebody,
[1:08:56] your friend or your family, because if
[1:08:58] you do,
[1:09:01] praise God.
[1:09:03] If you curse those who God's blessed,
[1:09:06] the curse will be go back to you. Better
[1:09:09] bless them.
[1:09:11] Book of Numbers chapter 24. And when
[1:09:14] Balam saw that it pleased the Lord to
[1:09:16] bless Israel, he went not as other times
[1:09:19] to seek for enhancement, but he set his
[1:09:22] face toward the wilderness.
[1:09:25] And Baam left his eye and he saw Israel
[1:09:28] abiding in his tent according to their
[1:09:30] tribes and the spirit of God came upon
[1:09:32] them. Whatever God bless will be a
[1:09:36] blessing. Whatever you do to God's
[1:09:38] children, God is always protecting them.
[1:09:41] So in verse 24 uh chapter 24 verse 12
[1:09:46] 13 and Balam said unto Balac spake I not
[1:09:51] also to thy messengers which thou
[1:09:53] sendest unto me saying if Balac would
[1:09:56] give me his house full of silver and
[1:09:58] gold. I cannot go beyond the commandment
[1:10:02] of the Lord to do either good or bad of
[1:10:05] my own mind but what the Lord has said
[1:10:07] that will I speak.
[1:10:09] Amen.
[1:10:12] So remember the purpose of bail
[1:10:17] would if Balac would give me his house
[1:10:20] and full of silver and gold. Notice that
[1:10:22] what was deep down in Balam's heart, he
[1:10:24] was motivated by money.
[1:10:27] He was using religion falsely to acquire
[1:10:30] wealth.
[1:10:32] So whenever you see a man making vast
[1:10:34] sum of money out of religion, you know
[1:10:36] it is the same spirit that was on Balum.
[1:10:39] And we can see a lot of them and many of
[1:10:42] them.
[1:10:43] Amen.
[1:10:44] In our lifetime.
[1:10:47] You open the televisions, you can see
[1:10:49] all of that. Every manifestations you
[1:10:52] can see. So in the book of numbers, so
[1:10:54] he cannot curse
[1:10:57] what God had blessed. So in verse 25 he
[1:11:00] said and when Israel abode in shittim
[1:11:02] and the people began to commit wardom
[1:11:04] and the daughters of Moab. So they are
[1:11:07] getting mixed up with the word just like
[1:11:10] Eve got mixed with the serpent.
[1:11:12] So they try to compromise.
[1:11:15] So that is the only thing that
[1:11:20] they could do is to mix confuse the
[1:11:23] believers and they called the people
[1:11:26] unto the sacrifice of their gods. And
[1:11:28] the people did eat and bow down to their
[1:11:30] gods. And Israel joined unto Balpure.
[1:11:34] And the anger of the Lord was kindled
[1:11:36] against Israel. And the Lord said unto
[1:11:39] Moses, "Take all the heads of the people
[1:11:43] and hang them up before the Lord against
[1:11:45] the son."
[1:11:47] So somebody say, "God is love. But if
[1:11:50] you go against the love of God, then
[1:11:52] judgment strike."
[1:11:53] Amen.
[1:11:55] The Lord said unto Moses, "Take all the
[1:11:57] heads of the people and hang them up
[1:11:58] before the Lord against the son, and
[1:12:00] that the fierce anger of the Lord may be
[1:12:03] turned away from Israel."
[1:12:05] And Moses said unto the judges of
[1:12:08] Israel, "Slay ye everyone his men that
[1:12:12] were joined with Balpure."
[1:12:14] So death follow
[1:12:17] Israel when they mix together with
[1:12:19] unbelief.
[1:12:21] Balam tricked Israel into joining them
[1:12:23] in a false worship
[1:12:26] because the commandment said that thou
[1:12:29] shalt not worship any other god besides
[1:12:32] me.
[1:12:32] Amen.
[1:12:34] And all those whose names are written in
[1:12:36] the lamb's book of life shall worship
[1:12:38] the e beast and be destroyed.
[1:12:41] Revelation chapter 13:E8.
[1:12:45] Because who you worship
[1:12:49] reveals your destiny.
[1:12:51] Amen.
[1:12:55] You can worship anything. You can
[1:12:57] worship a man. You can worship your
[1:12:59] wife. You can worship anything.
[1:13:05] Who you worship reveals your destiny.
[1:13:07] And so in Romans chapter 1 verse 25 28
[1:13:12] who changed the truth of God into a lie
[1:13:15] and worshiped and served the creator
[1:13:17] more than the creator who is blessed
[1:13:20] forever. Amen. For this god gave them up
[1:13:24] into a vile affliction.
[1:13:29] vile affliction, disgraceful passion or
[1:13:32] desire. Yeah.
[1:13:33] Or shamefully wicked.
[1:13:35] Amen.
[1:13:36] For this cause God gave them up unto
[1:13:39] vile affection. For even the women did
[1:13:42] change the natural use into that which
[1:13:44] is against nature.
[1:13:47] And likewise also the men leaving the
[1:13:49] natural use of a woman, burning their
[1:13:52] last ones toward another, men with men
[1:13:55] working that which is unsemingly and
[1:13:59] receiving in themselves that recompense
[1:14:01] of their error which was meat.
[1:14:03] And even as they did not like to retain
[1:14:06] God in the knowledge of uh to retain God
[1:14:09] in their knowledge, God gave them over
[1:14:11] to a reprobate mind.
[1:14:15] Reprobate mind means unfit mind. A per
[1:14:18] perverted way of thinking.
[1:14:21] Reprobate mind to do to do those things
[1:14:24] which are not convenient.
[1:14:29] So when these people of reprobate mind
[1:14:31] sin, they are breaking the law of God.
[1:14:34] That cannot be changed. And the law of
[1:14:36] God said the wages of sin is death.
[1:14:43] God does not directly destroy them.
[1:14:47] He just let them sin the way they want
[1:14:49] to because they have already rejected
[1:14:52] the word of God.
[1:14:52] Amen.
[1:14:54] Then their penalty of the law of God
[1:14:57] that cannot be changed applies to them.
[1:14:59] For the wages of sin cannot is death.
[1:15:02] But remember for the believers,
[1:15:06] Christ took the penalty of sin upon
[1:15:08] himself at Calvary.
[1:15:09] Thank you Lord. He who knows no sin
[1:15:12] becomes sin that we might become this
[1:15:14] very righteous. He took the sin to
[1:15:15] himself so that we might be free from
[1:15:18] the judgment. Romans 5:8
[1:15:22] verse 13 uh verse Romans 5 verse 8. But
[1:15:26] God commanded his love toward us in that
[1:15:30] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[1:15:32] for us.
[1:15:33] Amen.
[1:15:34] Can we say praise the Lord for that?
[1:15:36] Amen. much more than being now justified
[1:15:39] by his blood, we shall be saved from
[1:15:42] wrath through him.
[1:15:44] And if when we were enemies, we were
[1:15:48] reconciled to God by the death of his
[1:15:50] son, much more being reconciled, we
[1:15:52] shall be saved by his life.
[1:15:55] Amen.
[1:15:55] And not only so, but we also joy in God
[1:15:58] through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
[1:16:01] we have now received the atonement.
[1:16:03] Amen. Wherefore by one man sin into the
[1:16:06] word and death by sin and death pass
[1:16:08] upon all men. For that all have sin. For
[1:16:10] unto the law sin was in the word but sin
[1:16:13] is not imputed when there is no law.
[1:16:15] So remember that Satan's whole purpose
[1:16:17] is try to get you to break the word of
[1:16:19] God.
[1:16:20] That is his main purpose
[1:16:24] because the word of God is a law that
[1:16:26] God himself will be forced to bring
[1:16:28] judgment upon you if that law is broken.
[1:16:32] Yes,
[1:16:33] that has always been Satan's number one
[1:16:36] trick
[1:16:37] down through the ages since Eden. And he
[1:16:39] had
[1:16:42] using this technique.
[1:16:43] That's right.
[1:16:45] He was so successful in the technique.
[1:16:48] But notice carefully
[1:16:51] how God delivered Daniel out of this
[1:16:53] trap
[1:16:55] reveals how God will also deliver us.
[1:16:58] Amen. in this hour.
[1:17:01] Daniel chapter 6:22
[1:17:05] he said that my God hath sent his angel
[1:17:10] and shut the lion's mouth that they have
[1:17:13] not heard me. God sent his angel to us
[1:17:17] also in this hour
[1:17:19] because the devil is as a roaring lion
[1:17:21] seeking whom he may devour.
[1:17:24] That's right.
[1:17:25] All that to do have an angel sent to
[1:17:28] them to protect them in this hour will
[1:17:30] be debared. If you don't receive the
[1:17:32] angel, you will be devoured by the
[1:17:34] lions. The roaring lions in this last
[1:17:36] day. So the angel descended,
[1:17:39] praise God, to deliver or to preserve
[1:17:42] life
[1:17:44] in the face of a hungry lion.
[1:17:47] Angel descended to preserve the life of
[1:17:49] Daniel.
[1:17:50] That's right.
[1:17:52] Angel descended to deliver Sadra, Mesak,
[1:17:54] and Abednego in a fiery furnace.
[1:17:57] An angel descended to deliver Peter from
[1:18:00] the hand of Herod.
[1:18:01] An angel descended to Mary and Joseph,
[1:18:04] and they escaped Herod's decree of death
[1:18:06] to kill the babies.
[1:18:08] An angel descended to the tomb where
[1:18:09] Jesus was buried and rolled away the
[1:18:11] stone at the resurrection of Christ. And
[1:18:14] we have also an angel coming down or
[1:18:17] descended. Revelation 10:1, the mighty
[1:18:20] angel of God. Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:26] And in Revelation 22:16,
[1:18:30] he said, "I Jesus sent mine angel to
[1:18:34] testify unto you.
[1:18:38] I am the root and offspring of David and
[1:18:40] bright and morning star."
[1:18:43] An angel have two things when they were
[1:18:46] sent. According to Exodus 23:20,
[1:18:50] behold, I send an angel before thee, to
[1:18:53] keep thee in a way, and to bring thee
[1:18:56] into a place which I have prepared.
[1:18:59] Angel will do two things. To keep thee
[1:19:03] in the way. He will keep us in trouble
[1:19:07] because there is always a place being
[1:19:08] prepared for us.
[1:19:10] Amen. So our place is not here. Our
[1:19:12] place is to be with him.
[1:19:13] That's right. because he already
[1:19:14] prepared the mansions. Where I go, you
[1:19:17] shall go also.
[1:19:18] Hallelujah.
[1:19:19] Amen. So, what protects the church of
[1:19:21] God? The angel that was sent to testify
[1:19:25] the word of God to us. That's what the
[1:19:26] seven church age messenger were all
[1:19:28] about.
[1:19:29] That's right.
[1:19:30] Is to protect us.
[1:19:31] Thank you, Lord.
[1:19:33] And now, what about this hour when the
[1:19:35] pit has been open and Satan is roaring a
[1:19:37] lion seeking whom he may devour? the the
[1:19:41] bottomless pit was open.
[1:19:44] Revelation chapter nine through the
[1:19:47] spirit was come out. So he's now roaring
[1:19:50] like a lion waiting whom he may devour.
[1:19:54] But thank God he sent us angel
[1:19:57] to protect us, give us the way and to
[1:19:59] protect us to the place.
[1:20:02] Hallelujah.
[1:20:02] So we have the consolation.
[1:20:04] We have the grace of God in our lives.
[1:20:06] Thank you. So what happened then in the
[1:20:09] time of Daniel will be happening now in
[1:20:10] our day. So we are ready whatever
[1:20:12] happens that will come and will be
[1:20:15] fulfilled in our day. We have already
[1:20:17] sure promise that God will deliver us
[1:20:20] because he already sent his angel. Amen.
[1:20:23] So there was a greater law that met the
[1:20:25] challenge of the trap of the enemy and
[1:20:28] the penalty of death and that was the
[1:20:30] law of the love of God and the way of
[1:20:33] escape that God has provided for every
[1:20:35] true believer that put their trust in
[1:20:36] him. The law of God cannot be changed.
[1:20:40] But the grace of God took that law upon
[1:20:42] himself and met his own judgment and
[1:20:44] sent an angel to shut the mouth of the
[1:20:46] lion.
[1:20:48] Thank you.
[1:20:48] The same thing.
[1:20:49] Amen. and always says do not look don't
[1:20:52] look at the empty seat because angel are
[1:20:55] sitting right here.
[1:20:56] Amen.
[1:20:56] With us.
[1:20:57] Hallelujah.
[1:20:57] Amen. They were created to worship God.
[1:21:01] So we don't look at the quantity, we
[1:21:04] look at the quality.
[1:21:05] Amen.
[1:21:06] And I believe that angels is with us
[1:21:08] tonight.
[1:21:09] Amen.
[1:21:09] Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:11] The only thing is that they cannot enjoy
[1:21:13] what we enjoy.
[1:21:14] That's right. They were created to
[1:21:16] worship God, but they were not
[1:21:20] being redeemed because they don't
[1:21:21] understand what the salvation is all
[1:21:23] about.
[1:21:24] In Revelation 4,
[1:21:27] when Jen was caught up, come up here and
[1:21:29] show you things to come. There were
[1:21:33] there were elders surrounded the throne.
[1:21:35] Yes.
[1:21:36] And they worshiping praising God. Oh
[1:21:39] blessed God, the creator who created all
[1:21:41] things. He was a creator. He created all
[1:21:44] things. He created the angels to worship
[1:21:46] him.
[1:21:46] Amen.
[1:21:47] That's the only thing that the angel
[1:21:48] knows. Create to worship him. Oh,
[1:21:50] blessed art thou holy. Hallelujah. Glory
[1:21:53] to God. That's the only thing he knows.
[1:21:55] The same likewise if we know God as only
[1:21:57] the creator. That's why we know him as a
[1:22:00] creator. Our concept is just always
[1:22:02] asking God. Lord give me this. Lord give
[1:22:05] me a job. Lord give me a wife. Lord give
[1:22:07] me a good understand. Lord give me this.
[1:22:10] Uh Lord because he is only a creator.
[1:22:13] You just asked him
[1:22:16] as a creator, as a savior, our provider.
[1:22:19] But when the seal was open,
[1:22:21] praise God.
[1:22:23] Their worship as a creator turn into as
[1:22:26] a great redeemer.
[1:22:28] So it becomes so personal, God revealing
[1:22:30] himself and angel don't know anything
[1:22:32] about redeemer.
[1:22:33] That's right.
[1:22:34] Because they are not experiencing.
[1:22:37] So in the scripture, if you don't
[1:22:39] respondse to the word of God, you are
[1:22:40] just like angels.
[1:22:44] Don't know what we what what he's
[1:22:47] preaching. I don't hear
[1:22:51] angel rejoice upon hearing the word.
[1:22:53] Amen.
[1:22:54] Because we are being redeemed.
[1:22:57] They sing a new song.
[1:22:58] That's right.
[1:22:59] In Revelation 5, they sing a new
[1:23:01] revelation.
[1:23:02] Yes, sir.
[1:23:04] Hallelujah. The revelations from creator
[1:23:07] into a redeemer. It becomes so personal
[1:23:10] because the book was the was the name
[1:23:12] written in the book
[1:23:13] and our name written is the book. So
[1:23:15] that's why we rejoice in the Lord of
[1:23:17] God.
[1:23:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:19] Was the love of God. Amen.
[1:23:23] So last quotation I know you are tired
[1:23:26] so
[1:23:27] preaching brother
[1:23:30] and I'm tired too but
[1:23:33] but we are here to worship God. That is
[1:23:36] the only purpose that we are here.
[1:23:38] Whether you are tired or not,
[1:23:40] if you want to be blessed, just come.
[1:23:42] You expect something from the Lord, you
[1:23:44] get what you expect.
[1:23:45] That's right.
[1:23:46] If you expect to sleep, just sleep
[1:23:48] quietly.
[1:23:49] But you expect to be blessed. I believe
[1:23:51] that you will be blessed because the
[1:23:53] prophet said you can get what you every
[1:23:55] time you go into the church, you expect
[1:23:57] something.
[1:23:58] Even the preacher cannot preach. Just
[1:24:00] pray for him that he can preach
[1:24:02] because it is the gift of God.
[1:24:04] Hallelujah.
[1:24:05] So you cannot question the gift of God.
[1:24:07] the the gift of God will just operate
[1:24:09] sometime in silence.
[1:24:12] You're expecting but your expectation is
[1:24:16] or you're expecting a revival.
[1:24:20] But he preached very just like teacher.
[1:24:24] Do you feel disappointed?
[1:24:28] If you are disappointed,
[1:24:30] you need to be in the altar praying
[1:24:34] because God can do whatever he want.
[1:24:37] That's right.
[1:24:39] He may not meet your expectation because
[1:24:41] your expectation revival but he give
[1:24:43] just a simple message and sometimes you
[1:24:46] react.
[1:24:48] So your reaction is what the one that
[1:24:50] counts
[1:24:51] not the preacher because he will just
[1:24:53] preach according to the inspiration.
[1:24:55] Amen.
[1:24:56] You need to try to learn to accept
[1:24:59] whatever God's
[1:25:01] is giving among us.
[1:25:03] Sometime we receive steak.
[1:25:07] Sometimes we ate seafood
[1:25:10] but tonight maybe just
[1:25:14] vegetable salad.
[1:25:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:19] Amen.
[1:25:21] But you are being invited to eat. Just
[1:25:24] enjoy what is being served.
[1:25:26] That's right.
[1:25:27] It is your attitudes toward the word
[1:25:30] that is being count.
[1:25:32] That's right.
[1:25:32] Amen. We just enjoy every do not forsake
[1:25:35] the assembling of the the saints.
[1:25:38] Whatever food is being present, just
[1:25:40] enjoy it.
[1:25:42] If you cannot you today, just maybe the
[1:25:44] next time I will go, maybe there's a
[1:25:46] stake.
[1:25:48] Oh, it's always
[1:25:49] you're always in great expectation.
[1:25:52] Amen. Everybody's being saved just enjoy
[1:25:54] it.
[1:25:55] Hallelujah. Because we are now being
[1:25:58] trained to accept whatever God's
[1:26:02] want to give us.
[1:26:04] Amen.
[1:26:07] And if you're not satisfied with the
[1:26:09] preacher
[1:26:11] sometime you feel you're going out but
[1:26:14] you will miss the point if you were
[1:26:15] going out.
[1:26:16] That's right. Maybe at the last moment
[1:26:19] the word that was being prepared for you
[1:26:21] when you go out you're you cannot just
[1:26:24] like brother Warren said when you are
[1:26:26] just in the live streaming just like
[1:26:28] you're you're you're looking at the
[1:26:30] cooking
[1:26:32] cooking demonstration
[1:26:35] you cannot smell you cannot eat you just
[1:26:37] baiting oh that's but you cannot enjoy
[1:26:40] it because it's just in but if you are
[1:26:46] live in a live
[1:26:48] services. Yes sir.
[1:26:50] When somebody is coming and picking what
[1:26:52] they you're just enjoying too.
[1:26:54] Amen.
[1:26:56] Brother, what are you picking? I am
[1:26:58] picking a fruit. Oh, what is your So we
[1:27:00] are enjoying ones another's fellowship.
[1:27:02] That's right.
[1:27:03] Amen.
[1:27:04] Because the word of God is being now
[1:27:06] being fulfilled. The pope is being so
[1:27:09] let us not focus about the the
[1:27:11] fulfillment of the the the pope from
[1:27:13] America. Let us focus how God cemented
[1:27:16] his bride.
[1:27:19] They are not glued because if you are
[1:27:21] glued there at a time, expiration date
[1:27:23] and it will turn loose.
[1:27:24] But the prophecy there will be cemented
[1:27:27] by love and we believe that the love is
[1:27:29] the capstone ministry that is we are
[1:27:31] cemented by the love of God in these
[1:27:33] last days. So let us not focus on the
[1:27:36] pope but let us focus the prophecy that
[1:27:39] one of these days we will be cemented by
[1:27:41] love and that love is the word of God
[1:27:43] being revealed in our day. We have just
[1:27:45] one mind, one focus on one attention and
[1:27:48] one goal and that is the changing of our
[1:27:49] body.
[1:27:51] Gal
[1:27:53] so last quotations the mighty conqueror.
[1:27:57] He said, "I believe that every word
[1:28:00] can never be changed if God has once
[1:28:03] spoke it."
[1:28:04] Amen.
[1:28:05] And it's forever the truth.
[1:28:07] Amen.
[1:28:08] You and I keep learning more wisdom. You
[1:28:12] know, more now than you did a few years
[1:28:14] ago.
[1:28:15] We are progressing. We are keep on
[1:28:17] learning.
[1:28:18] A little girl sitting here now, she's
[1:28:20] just a child. Her parent has to lead
[1:28:23] her. After a while, she'll grow up and
[1:28:26] probably in her days she progresses. She
[1:28:28] might be smarter than her ma mother is
[1:28:31] now. Especially in our days that all the
[1:28:35] the the children their babysitter is the
[1:28:40] uh iPad or something like that. That's
[1:28:44] the babysitter. Just like in the
[1:28:45] Philippines,
[1:28:48] all the children are American or English
[1:28:52] speakaking with American accent.
[1:28:55] They don't go to school yet, but they
[1:28:57] speak. I am ashamed to face them because
[1:29:01] they speak fluent English
[1:29:04] with English accent
[1:29:08] because they are being babysat by the
[1:29:10] YouTube.
[1:29:11] Amen.
[1:29:12] What they're looking so they adapt. Yes.
[1:29:16] And some are British accent.
[1:29:21] Unfortunately,
[1:29:23] sister Joseph and nephew is listening to
[1:29:26] our Russian. So we speak Russian.
[1:29:30] So whatever is being fed that will you
[1:29:32] adopt. So they have babysitter. They are
[1:29:34] learning and learning and learning.
[1:29:36] Yes.
[1:29:37] You know she progress she might be
[1:29:40] smarter than her brother is now cuz she
[1:29:43] keeps progressing but God is infinite.
[1:29:46] Amen.
[1:29:47] He can change. He was perfect to begin
[1:29:50] with.
[1:29:51] He will be the same at the end. He can't
[1:29:54] change. So whatever his attitude was
[1:29:57] towards anything in the Bible, it has to
[1:30:00] be the same now or he did wrong the way
[1:30:03] he acted then. So he's got to never
[1:30:05] change. Amen.
[1:30:06] That's why we can rest our soul in the
[1:30:08] unfailing word of the promises of God
[1:30:11] because the word of God can never
[1:30:12] change.
[1:30:14] Hallelujah. People change. Wait a
[1:30:16] minute. Government change but the word
[1:30:17] will never change
[1:30:19] according to his promise. He will never
[1:30:21] change his mind about his word
[1:30:22] concerning your salvation, concerning
[1:30:25] your healing, concerning your
[1:30:27] deliverance. If you believe the word of
[1:30:29] God, he will never change his promises.
[1:30:31] Amen. In whatever circumstance, he will
[1:30:33] never change. As long as you have the
[1:30:36] right mental attitude toward his
[1:30:38] promise, then he is subligated because
[1:30:41] his word cannot change. He's going to
[1:30:43] fulfill it. So let us stand tonight.
[1:30:45] Hallelujah.
[1:30:46] [Applause]
[1:30:50] So he give us eternal life, inspiration.
[1:30:53] Are you excited?
[1:30:54] Amen.
[1:30:55] My brothers and sisters,
[1:30:57] so we began to adapt to the situation of
[1:31:00] your church. Yeah.
[1:31:04] Sometimes the preaching is not the way
[1:31:05] you expect it,
[1:31:07] but God that's God's way.
[1:31:09] That's right.
[1:31:10] So, we need to learn to adjust ourselves
[1:31:13] to the will of God, not to our feelings,
[1:31:16] not to our wants.
[1:31:18] Because just like when you pray,
[1:31:22] Lord said when you pray in my name, I
[1:31:24] will do it.
[1:31:25] Amen.
[1:31:26] But he didn't say immediately.
[1:31:29] That's right.
[1:31:31] When you pray maybe it took how many
[1:31:33] years?
[1:31:36] So your attitudes toward your prayer
[1:31:39] counts. Sometimes you say wait and you
[1:31:43] need to trust him more and more.
[1:31:46] Amen.
[1:31:47] And sometimes you pray for healing it
[1:31:49] didn't come to pass. Just keep on
[1:31:50] praying.
[1:31:51] That's right.
[1:31:52] Just keep on believing. Just keep on
[1:31:54] claiming
[1:31:55] you'll never. And sometimes when you
[1:31:57] pray he said yes no
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:01] the answers of no is as good as yes.
[1:32:04] Amen.
[1:32:04] Amen.
[1:32:06] And sometime he say wait.
[1:32:09] So God balance his children. So we need
[1:32:13] to go according to the way he wants us
[1:32:16] to go.
[1:32:17] That's right. Yes.
[1:32:18] But one thing is sure, when you pray in
[1:32:21] his name, he will do it
[1:32:23] according to his time, according to his
[1:32:25] season.
[1:32:27] And according to how we
[1:32:31] submit ourselves to his will.
[1:32:34] Amen. What is that?
[1:32:38] So it's got it all in control.
[1:32:42] Whatever our situations today, we are
[1:32:45] living in the most exciting time. Amen.
[1:32:48] [Music]
[1:32:50] And when you try to commit everything
[1:32:52] unto the Lord,
[1:32:54] you will see supernatural things in your
[1:32:57] life.
[1:32:59] There sometimes we decide to serve God,
[1:33:01] but we have something reservation. We
[1:33:04] will serve God, but I will just keep my
[1:33:08] computer games behind.
[1:33:11] I will serve God but uh
[1:33:15] I still have so many issues in life so I
[1:33:18] cannot fully surrender my life.
[1:33:21] Don't waste your time my brothers and
[1:33:22] sisters this is a time that we need to
[1:33:25] consecrate our life.
[1:33:26] Amen.
[1:33:27] Forget everything that's hinder you
[1:33:32] for God to manifest his word in that
[1:33:34] way. We are living in the most glorious
[1:33:36] day.
[1:33:36] Amen.
[1:33:38] Because God is not respector of any
[1:33:40] person. He don't look at our status in
[1:33:43] life. He look at our heart.
[1:33:45] Amen.
[1:33:47] And he is pleased to
[1:33:52] receive us.
[1:33:54] Thank you Lord.
[1:33:54] In his life.
[1:33:56] So whatever situation you are in,
[1:33:58] remember
[1:34:00] the word of God can never change.
[1:34:03] Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:34:05] He's got it all in control.
[1:34:06] So, let's say it all in the spirit of
[1:34:08] the Lord.
[1:34:12] He's got it all
[1:34:15] in control.
[1:34:21] He's got it all in control.
[1:34:27] Oh,
[1:34:29] he's put that reassurance
[1:34:33] way down in my soul.
[1:34:40] He's got it all in control. My father
[1:34:46] knows.
[1:34:49] My father knows what I need.
[1:34:57] My father knows what I need.
[1:35:05] In everything I go through, he knows
[1:35:10] what's best for me.
[1:35:16] My father knows what I need.
[1:35:24] I've put my life in his hands.
[1:35:33] I've put my life in his hands.
[1:35:40] So every road I walk down, I'm sure it's
[1:35:45] in his plan.
[1:35:51] I've put my life in his hands.
[1:35:59] He's got it all in control.
[1:36:07] He's got it all in control.
[1:36:13] Oh,
[1:36:15] he's put that reassur
[1:36:19] way down in my soul.
[1:36:26] He's got it all in control.
[1:36:31] Amen. Brother Jonathan, if you could
[1:36:33] come close our service in a word of
[1:36:34] prayer this evening.

[1:36:56] we've heard tonight, Lord. Restore
[1:36:58] Brother Mario, and watch over us on our
[1:37:01] way home, Lord, and bring us back on
[1:37:02] Sunday, Lord, ready to hear from you.
[1:37:05] Thank you, Lord. We love you, Lord. In
[1:37:07] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:37:09] Amen. He is able, more than able.
[1:37:14] He is aable,
[1:37:18] more
[1:37:19] than able
[1:37:23] to accomplish what concerns me today.
[1:37:31] He is aable,
[1:37:34] more than a
[1:37:39] to handle anything that comes my way.
[1:37:47] He is aable,
[1:37:49] more than able
[1:37:55] to do much more than I could ever dream.
[1:38:02] He is aable,
[1:38:05] more than a
[1:38:10] to make me what he wants me to be. Amen.
[1:38:16] God bless you. See you Sunday.

[1:40:02] heat.
[1:40:04] [Music]
