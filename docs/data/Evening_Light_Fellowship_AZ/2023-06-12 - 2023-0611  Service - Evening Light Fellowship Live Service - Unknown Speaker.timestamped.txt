[1:04:08] in Spanish it says it stays

[1:04:20] longer than the Spanish translation

[1:07:20] in the year 60.
[1:07:24] he also preaches under this title

[1:07:31] the faith hope and charity
[1:07:34] they're the three greatest gifts
[1:07:38] that God can give to us
[1:07:41] faith hope and charity amen
[1:07:47] when he's going to do something great
[1:07:50] and God's going to do something great
[1:07:52] with us
[1:07:53] he's going to do something great
[1:07:56] and he needs that that bride
[1:07:59] have those three
[1:08:03] express myself today
[1:08:08] it's easy to understand faith
[1:08:23] they don't allow us the five senses
[1:08:25] don't allow us
[1:08:28] to communicate with our internal
[1:08:31] and it's only the Sixth Sense
[1:08:35] to communicate with God
[1:08:38] to come in contact with the spirit
[1:08:42] that is a sixth sense
[1:08:48] you need to exercise
[1:08:50] so they can be in good conditions like
[1:08:54] the musicians
[1:08:57] they have a very good sense
[1:09:00] [Music]
[1:09:09] they use the the sense of ice
[1:09:13] they go through there through the woods
[1:09:17] the same thing that you can see
[1:09:25] because the sense
[1:09:31] and as we get older vamos uh
[1:10:09] but if you don't exercise
[1:10:12] amen
[1:10:42] [Music]
[1:10:56] it's not going to be any good I mean
[1:11:01] I have a problem with this arm muchacho
[1:11:04] when I was a younger
[1:11:06] and I couldn't really do exercise
[1:11:11] and over here strong arm and this I know
[1:11:14] it was the same arms
[1:11:17] but one was exercise
[1:11:21] that is a sense of faith
[1:11:24] is
[1:11:27] where I can stay
[1:11:29] the scripture that says
[1:11:32] look at ourselves
[1:11:35] if you're in the faith
[1:11:40] it's good to be in church
[1:11:43] it's good to be part of a Ministry but
[1:11:47] it's much better to be in the faith amen
[1:11:50] foreign
[1:12:36] the Faith of Our Fathers
[1:12:39] exercise
[1:12:40] and what can we say
[1:12:46] I like this
[1:12:50] of Jesus Christ
[1:13:37] says something like this this is
[1:13:41] says take a look this is
[1:13:45] going to be shown in the last days
[1:13:50] of the church
[1:13:55] do you understand

[1:15:06] want to say
[1:15:08] amen
[1:15:15] foreign
[1:15:40] [Music]

[1:16:48] so
[1:16:51] I don't want that uh my wife
[1:17:25] we are the love of Christ
[1:17:28] it it is
[1:17:32] there's a scripture in Jeremiah 31.
[1:17:36] this is with love Eternal I have loved
[1:17:39] you
[1:17:40] if we are the love of God you're
[1:17:44] Eternal just like God amen amen glory to
[1:17:48] God for that if we are his love there's

[1:17:54] just because
[1:17:57] I'm happy this morning
[1:18:03] to be part of the the brothers
[1:18:13] in sane
[1:18:19] it says like there's a scripture or the
[1:18:21] message this is
[1:18:25] why the Christians is born again
[1:18:28] it doesn't have an end
[1:18:30] because he has eternal life and eternal
[1:18:34] life is
[1:18:36] part of the same life of God
[1:18:42] and the same God in Greek Zoe
[1:19:03] a man being born again
[1:19:07] his spirit
[1:19:10] is changed
[1:19:13] he becomes a part of God
[1:19:18] just like God himself glory to God amen
[1:19:22] amen
[1:19:25] when someone knows that is impossible
[1:19:28] it's impossible to not have hope
[1:19:32] remember the three gifts
[1:19:39] the faith is a sense
[1:19:45] we are an expression of the love of God
[1:19:48] says many times
[1:19:50] we fail in hope

[1:20:30] Tennessee is
[1:20:37] 126. this is
[1:20:43] foreign
[1:20:50] which hath been hid from the ages and
[1:20:53] from the generations but now it's made
[1:20:55] manifest to the Saints again
[1:21:05] to whom God would make known what is the
[1:21:09] riches of the glory of his this mystery
[1:21:11] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[1:21:14] you the hope of glory
[1:22:02] starts to talk to us about the mystery
[1:22:04] of Christ
[1:22:06] since the beginning
[1:22:14] this is the beginning in the creation
[1:22:59] [Music]
[1:23:13] through
[1:23:15] the blood
[1:24:08] and it was Jesus
[1:24:28] foreign
[1:25:06] it was Christ
[1:25:08] this morning
[1:25:14] the hope of glory amen glorious
[1:25:19] we are happy
[1:25:27] it's a it's a sense
[1:25:30] very necessary
[1:25:39] they can preserve life
[1:25:54] [Music]
[1:26:39] to find life
[1:26:49] there's loss of life foreign
[1:26:59] foreign
[1:27:44] looking for a reason uh
[1:27:47] I like
[1:27:50] indications
[1:27:54] is the truth
[1:27:56] and I'm here this morning
[1:28:02] and I'm here to say amen
[1:28:05] I am the proof that this message is true
[1:28:10] [Music]
[1:28:19] the Believers in the message in the time
[1:28:21] of Jesus
[1:28:24] they got disappointed and the best time
[1:28:30] they got disappointed in front of the
[1:28:32] calvary and it was the best time
[1:28:35] this is when the lamb was going to pay
[1:28:37] the price
[1:28:39] it was the best time
[1:28:42] when God was taken in prison
[1:28:47] the message
[1:28:51] and they got disappointed
[1:28:59] patience
[1:29:01] Peter got so depressed
[1:29:06] and he did it with words bad words
[1:29:09] he lost hope
[1:29:30] they should have been there waiting for
[1:29:32] him is that right
[1:29:48] they were fighting
[1:29:50] why were they hiding
[1:29:53] they lost hope
[1:29:57] you lose hope
[1:30:00] you get disappointed
[1:30:02] and from disappointment
[1:30:05] goes to depression and now you don't
[1:30:08] want to come to church
[1:30:11] he was so depressed
[1:30:14] that he didn't go to church himself
[1:30:20] Jesus showed himself see it
[1:30:24] nobody showing us out there in that
[1:30:25] service
[1:30:27] because he completed his work
[1:30:31] he didn't care about the attitudes of
[1:30:34] the disciples
[1:30:37] to finish his work
[1:30:41] and when his disciples were disappointed
[1:30:48] and he said come
[1:30:59] was Thomas
[1:31:03] when they told him he said no no I don't
[1:31:07] see it
[1:31:09] that's why it's good to come to church
[1:31:16] but our lord Jesus
[1:31:21] in the next week he comes to service
[1:31:24] again
[1:31:27] he always comes to church
[1:31:31] all the disciples were there
[1:31:35] this time
[1:31:39] and Jesus shows himself and he says
[1:31:45] he said something last time
[1:31:47] hahaha
[1:31:49] pencil and Thomas
[1:31:52] oh they already they spilled the beans
[1:31:58] still
[1:33:09] that's not correct
[1:33:35] so you want to get out of here
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:44] so when we see these things happening in
[1:33:47] San Francisco California I was in San
[1:33:50] Francisco California last week
[1:33:52] and it is very bad there
[1:33:55] no no lion don't go
[1:34:02] but that is not going to disappoint me
[1:34:05] in San Francisco California I didn't
[1:34:08] expect to see uh Saints there no no
[1:34:11] huh
[1:34:22] foreign
[1:35:06] Cinco
[1:35:10] in Espanola menu
[1:35:14] It's a Great Expression here
[1:35:22] it was me
[1:35:25] but to take his my sins upon him
[1:35:29] to be like him ah
[1:35:32] what's up
[1:35:43] go with him
[1:35:46] definitely
[1:35:48] that gives us hope
[1:35:52] I can see him from myself in in a word
[1:35:55] and I can see that and I failed
[1:35:58] you see my errors
[1:36:01] and that's fine
[1:36:03] so we can take away
[1:36:06] the Comfort right
[1:36:14] the expression of brother Branham
[1:36:18] I think it was a sister that said
[1:36:21] I'm not what I use what I am
[1:36:25] also not where I used to be
[1:36:27] it sounds beautiful
[1:36:32] it's like an excuse
[1:36:37] how many years does the message
[1:36:41] how many times how many years as
[1:36:43] Believers I think it's time
[1:36:46] that we
[1:36:49] have to do
[1:36:51] excuse
[1:36:59] time the bride of Christ
[1:37:01] be what it has to be amen
[1:37:06] that's why God sends us his holy ghosts
[1:37:13] and we can fail to say excuses amen
[1:37:17] is
[1:37:48] God can make you be here today
[1:37:51] in conclusive he's not going to leave
[1:37:53] work undone
[1:37:55] foreign
[1:38:03] amen
[1:38:19] is
[1:38:20] going to be concluded completely
[1:38:23] I'm here today this morning
[1:38:42] my position in Christ
[1:38:46] amen
[1:38:48] foreign
[1:39:05] take this this body
[1:39:08] you can take this
[1:39:11] you guys understand each other
[1:39:16] that he can take that
[1:39:18] is
[1:39:19] to be like him amen
[1:39:26] that's why the devil hates us
[1:39:29] but listen to this
[1:39:32] he always wanted to be like him
[1:39:42] he was so spectacular
[1:39:48] the Throne of God
[1:39:51] amen
[1:39:54] that's why
[1:39:57] this is
[1:40:03] a promise so big
[1:40:09] he transforms himself and our enemy
[1:40:13] because he can accept that
[1:40:17] he was the greatest
[1:40:19] in the creation
[1:40:21] it was a party when he was there
[1:40:24] foreign
[1:41:34] a situation that happened in Chile
[1:41:39] and I want to tell you because it's
[1:41:41] related to this
[1:41:42] foreign
[1:41:47] ERS that were buried in the mind
[1:41:52] it fell apart the mine
[1:41:56] so I'm going to tell you
[1:41:59] it has elements
[1:42:03] to understand this better
[1:42:21] there's about 700 meters down
[1:43:22] but he was lost just like them all of
[1:43:24] them
[1:43:25] down there he couldn't do nothing it
[1:43:29] was a specialist in rescue
[1:43:31] but if he was up there he would be very
[1:43:34] useful but he was down there
[1:43:37] just like everyone else laughs
[1:43:40] okay so what does this man do come on
[1:43:44] he's starting to remember something of
[1:43:46] his instructions
[1:43:52] I have to maintain
[1:43:54] alive the hope
[1:43:58] these people down here these miners
[1:44:03] we're all gonna die
[1:44:05] and this man said
[1:44:07] I'm gonna do everything possible
[1:44:14] they started to look down there crawling
[1:44:16] around in the darkness
[1:44:20] that the miners use
[1:44:22] [Music]
[1:44:24] he found a sign
[1:44:37] we're going to go to that place of
[1:44:39] Refuge
[1:44:40] and that guy he got really excited
[1:44:43] in the midst of the loss
[1:44:46] there was a place of Refuge amen
[1:44:51] don't you feel great that you have a
[1:44:53] place of Refuge yes
[1:44:56] it's Christ
[1:45:00] and good is Christ
[1:45:02] and these miners they went to that place
[1:45:08] it was a place that was protected
[1:45:12] I had a couple reserves there of food
[1:45:16] but he was a specialist
[1:45:19] he couldn't rescue them but what he did
[1:45:23] know
[1:45:25] he had to maintain hope ministers
[1:45:35] that
[1:45:55] and surely
[1:45:58] and some were left with Hunger
[1:46:01] even though what they received
[1:46:05] there was going to help them to live one
[1:46:07] more day
[1:46:09] of it
[1:46:11] is
[1:46:12] a perfect type of the faithful Ministry
[1:46:18] the faithful Ministry the pastor the
[1:46:22] ministers
[1:46:23] they're not going to take you out of
[1:46:25] here
[1:46:28] but they can't give you the necessary
[1:46:32] you can live one more day
[1:46:35] while we wait for Rescue and that's what
[1:46:38] this man did
[1:46:40] and when someone started to get crazy
[1:46:44] and something started to lose hope
[1:46:49] say what's happening
[1:46:52] they're coming for us
[1:46:55] they're going to get us out of here
[1:46:59] but he had faith
[1:47:07] sometimes
[1:47:11] and some shakers
[1:47:17] then they will regroup their hope and
[1:47:20] then the peace would come
[1:47:22] and another day
[1:47:30] they came from above
[1:47:36] because some people in the message
[1:47:38] believe they're Professionals in rescue
[1:47:43] there's some uh eliminated
[1:47:46] and they want to rescue us from down
[1:47:49] here
[1:47:50] the rescue comes from above what
[1:47:53] happened
[1:47:54] what happened in Chile
[1:47:56] the government
[1:47:58] it made a promise
[1:48:01] we're not going to rest in
[1:48:12] this is
[1:48:13] going to invest in it
[1:48:15] Gloria
[1:48:25] and I give glory to God
[1:48:36] that the children have got to be lost
[1:48:38] here
[1:48:40] we're going to make a plan to find you
[1:48:44] get you out of there
[1:48:46] that's the same way
[1:48:50] they got the best equipment the best
[1:48:53] technology
[1:48:54] from all over the world the best
[1:49:02] foreign
[1:49:41] there were some diseases happening
[1:49:44] there was one man
[1:49:47] I can keep him with hope glorious
[1:49:53] for a great ministry
[1:49:56] that can maintain their hope
[1:49:59] and one time
[1:50:17] they felt a vibration
[1:50:19] a noise
[1:50:23] and there's a probe that pops through it
[1:50:26] was a camera
[1:50:28] in the camera in the middle they
[1:50:31] understood
[1:50:33] they were looking for them and they had
[1:50:36] found them
[1:50:43] they were still down there foreign
[1:51:00] [Applause]
[1:51:07] it was called the messenger
[1:51:12] glorious
[1:51:17] he had a message
[1:51:20] we're looking for you
[1:51:26] you're walking the walk
[1:51:30] and talk to you about a message
[1:51:34] maybe you didn't understand very much
[1:51:40] my father's looking for me
[1:51:45] when they saw that remember
[1:51:48] they were weak they were dirty Italian
[1:51:50] they were very hungry
[1:51:54] that they were looking for them and they
[1:51:57] had found them
[1:52:09] and they put it on the camera
[1:52:13] and that message is
[1:52:20] a jubilee up there
[1:52:23] everybody was hugging each other even
[1:52:27] though they were still down
[1:52:28] but they had received the message
[1:52:31] [Applause]
[1:52:33] to go
[1:52:35] the hope of glory
[1:52:37] the hope of life
[1:52:41] [Applause]
[1:52:44] that there's a jubilee
[1:52:46] when someone takes the name of Jesus yes
[1:52:50] there is
[1:52:55] they were kissing each other
[1:52:57] we found them
[1:53:36] to see the state that they were in
[1:53:39] Lomas
