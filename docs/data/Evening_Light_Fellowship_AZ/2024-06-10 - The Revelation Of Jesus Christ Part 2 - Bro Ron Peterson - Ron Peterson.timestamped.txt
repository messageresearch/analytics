[38:08] he knew the prophet he spoke five

[39:12] last Sunday with us next Sunday so don't
[39:16] let me forget we want to pray for him
[39:18] before he
[39:19] goes young boy raised up here in the
[39:22] church now he's joining the
[39:24] military amen Lord watch over him
[39:27] amen amen Steve yes sir yeah amen
[39:34] yeah
[39:36] amen turn with me if you would to the
[39:38] Book of Luke Chapter
[39:42] n Matthew
[39:45] 26 so we'll go first to Luke chapter 9
[40:08] verses 18-
[40:16] 21 and it came to pass as he was alone
[40:21] praying his disciples were with him and
[40:25] he asked them saying whom say the people
[40:28] that I
[40:30] am they answering said John the
[40:33] Baptist some say
[40:36] Elias others say that one of the old
[40:38] prophets is risen
[40:41] again some of you wonder where the
[40:45] doctrinal teaching even within the
[40:47] message of return Ministry comes from
[40:50] you even see it right here who do they
[40:53] say they were guessing they were trying
[40:55] to put it on something because they're
[40:57] trying to hear of something that's
[40:59] happening but they can't put put their
[41:01] finger on it so it must be John the
[41:04] Baptist or it must be one of the
[41:06] prophets risen
[41:07] again and he said unto them but whom say
[41:11] ye that I am Peter answering said the
[41:16] Christ of
[41:18] God and he straightly charged them and
[41:21] commanded them to tell no
[41:24] man that thing
[41:29] the revelation of Jesus Christ is so
[41:34] Sovereign and it is such a secret
[41:37] thing it's personal amen he says don't
[41:42] tell nobody I command you tell no man
[41:46] this father now in the name of Jesus
[41:49] Christ we commit this service into thy
[41:52] hands I pray Lord that you will give me
[41:55] words to say give them ears to hear of
[41:58] what the spirit is saying to the church
[42:00] we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God
[42:04] bless you you can be seated turn with me
[42:06] if you
[42:09] would to Matthew chapter
[42:16] 26 Matthew
[42:20] 26 verses
[42:22] 59- 68
[42:28] now the chief priests and
[42:31] elders and all the
[42:33] councel
[42:35] sought false witness against Jesus to
[42:39] put him to death when people are looking
[42:42] for something to find a mistake to find
[42:46] [Music]
[42:47] fault they'll look and they'll look
[42:51] hard but found none amen yay though many
[42:56] false Witnesses
[42:58] came yet found they none yeah at the
[43:04] last came two false
[43:07] Witnesses and said this fellow said I'm
[43:11] able to destroy the temple of God and to
[43:14] build it in three
[43:16] days now he said it
[43:20] amen but they thought it was the Holy
[43:24] Temple but it wasn't until he was was
[43:27] resurrected that they understood it was
[43:29] the Temple of his body
[43:32] amen and the high priest arose and said
[43:35] unto him answerest thou
[43:39] nothing what is it which these Witnesses
[43:44] against
[43:45] thee and Jesus held his
[43:48] peace and the high priest answered and
[43:51] said unto him I adure Thee by the Living
[43:55] God that thou has tell whether thou be
[43:58] the Christ the son of
[44:02] God but Jesus saith unto
[44:07] him thou H has said nevertheless I say
[44:11] unto you herea you shall see the son of
[44:14] man sitting on the right hand of power
[44:17] and coming in the Clouds Of Heaven amen
[44:20] then the high priest rent his
[44:23] clothes saying he has spoken
[44:27] blasphemy what further need have we of
[44:31] witnesses behold now we ye have heard
[44:35] his
[44:36] blasphemy what think ye they answered
[44:39] and said he's guilty of
[44:43] death then they did spit in his
[44:46] face buffeted
[44:49] him and others smote him with the palms
[44:53] of their
[44:54] hands talk about a hatred
[45:00] saying prophesy unto us thou
[45:05] Christ who is he that smokee
[45:10] thee may God bless the reading of his
[45:15] word I'd like to continue on with this
[45:18] thought of the revelation of Jesus
[45:20] Christ part
[45:25] two and a subject the anointed word
[45:28] reveals our position in the body of
[45:32] Christ now like I said in our last
[45:36] service and may I reiterate it so you
[45:38] all
[45:40] understand what makes us
[45:43] different than all the
[45:46] rest what makes us
[45:49] think that God will hear our
[45:53] prayers God will answer them God will
[45:56] take it to his
[46:02] kingdom
[46:04] and I've just been pondering all of
[46:07] these things because saints of God God
[46:10] has done something very very
[46:12] Supernatural in this end time
[46:16] amen it has been on display and there
[46:19] were thousands of times that it was
[46:22] Vindicated of God God backs up his word
[46:27] yes he does we do not have to defend it
[46:29] God defends it himself you can see there
[46:32] that before the council and elders and
[46:35] they
[46:36] sought something that they could put him
[46:38] to death
[46:40] for and they said I adur Thee by the
[46:43] Living God if Thou Art the Christ tell
[46:48] us yet he held his
[46:52] peace who do you say that I am
[46:56] thou
[46:58] sayest but I'll tell you what makes us
[47:00] different than everyone
[47:02] else is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[47:05] to you personally thank you
[47:08] Lord You're not baptized in name father
[47:11] son Holy
[47:13] Ghost some trinitarian
[47:16] doctrine that you're baptized in the
[47:19] only name given among men whereby we
[47:21] must be saved the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:25] Christ for Peter on that day of
[47:29] Pentecost here and be well known among
[47:32] ye Brethren that this same Jesus whom
[47:34] you
[47:36] crucified God has this day made him both
[47:39] Lord and Christ amen thank you Lord
[47:43] hallelujah
[47:45] amen Luke chap 22 one more scripture
[47:50] reading
[47:51] please Luke 22: 63-71
[48:01] and the men that held Jesus mocked him
[48:03] and smot
[48:06] him and when they had blindfolded him
[48:09] they struck him on the face and asked
[48:11] him saying
[48:13] prophesy who is it that smoke
[48:18] thee and many other things
[48:21] blasphemously spake they against him
[48:26] and as soon as it was day the elders and
[48:31] the people and the chief priests and the
[48:34] scribes came together and led him into
[48:38] their counsil
[48:39] saying art thou the
[48:43] Christ tell
[48:45] us and he said unto them if I tell
[48:50] you ye will not
[48:53] believe and if I also ask you
[48:57] you will not answer me nor let me
[49:00] go Hereafter shall the son of man sit on
[49:04] the right hand of the power of God and
[49:08] they said they
[49:11] all art thou then the Son of
[49:15] God and he said unto them ye say that I
[49:21] am and they said what
[49:24] need we any further Witness es for we
[49:29] ourselves have heard of his own
[49:36] mouth God does not reveal himself to
[49:40] everyone these were religious
[49:44] people these were people who studied the
[49:47] law of
[49:50] Moses Revelation is not given to you by
[49:53] men neither taught to you by men that's
[49:56] you can't receive it from a man you
[49:58] can't receive it from your pastor may I
[50:00] say this you can't receive it from the
[50:02] prophet because the prophet can preach
[50:04] Revelation but you must have the ear to
[50:07] hear what the spirit is
[50:10] saying Thank You
[50:17] Lord The Secret of all this lies in the
[50:21] fact that
[50:22] Jesus had told Peter that flesh and
[50:24] blood has not revealed this to you
[50:27] but my Father which is in heaven and
[50:29] Upon This Rock I will build my church
[50:33] The Church of Jesus Christ is not built
[50:35] upon Peter it is built upon the solid
[50:38] rock of the revelation of Jesus Christ
[50:42] and guess what the Gates of Hell will
[50:44] try to Prevail against it but it
[50:49] cannot but it will
[50:51] try you will be in battle you will be
[50:55] tested that's right but you will be
[50:59] delivered hallelujah thank you
[51:02] Lord Revelation is the quickening power
[51:06] given to your understanding it is the
[51:09] illumination of your mind amen otherwise
[51:13] your minds are darkened the Bible says a
[51:15] carnally minded man cannot receive the
[51:18] things of God neither can he understand
[51:21] the things of
[51:22] God but it says you hath he quickened
[51:25] Hallelujah he has illuminated your mind
[51:28] he has shown into your parts of Darkness
[51:31] driven away the darkness so that you
[51:34] might see who you are when you catch the
[51:37] revelation of him on you also catch
[51:41] automatically the revelation of who you
[51:44] are where your pedigree where you come
[51:47] from and where you're going somebody say
[51:51] Amen if you get one you get the other
[51:58] revelation of the Holy Ghost is the
[52:00] power of transformation for every
[52:03] believer it changed Paul from a
[52:06] Pharisee to a born again Christian it
[52:10] changed Tax Collectors fishermen
[52:13] drunkards prostitutes turn them into
[52:17] Sons and Daughters of God it'll change
[52:21] denominational Christians of laiaa into
[52:25] Holy Ghost filled Bible Believers and
[52:28] Holy Ghost filled Believers in this time
[52:30] too somebody say Amen to
[52:34] that I am a witness to that thank you
[52:39] Lord
[52:41] Hallelujah
[52:42] Lord Saul had been taught all of the
[52:46] great religious teachings under
[52:50] Gia Paul began to brag and he says
[52:53] I am a Pharisee of Pharisees
[52:58] concerning the law
[53:01] blameless and he began to brag upon
[53:04] himself and he says but I consider all
[53:08] of this former learning is
[53:10] done that I might know
[53:13] Christ you see you can know
[53:16] religion you can have Commandments and
[53:19] understanding of some religious teaching
[53:23] and you can be religious no no doubt
[53:25] that Saul was very
[53:31] religious but it took an experience to
[53:35] meet the pillar of fire
[53:37] himself and there God blinded his eyes
[53:40] but opened his eyes
[53:43] amen and
[53:45] Saul of Tarsus became Paul of
[53:50] Damascus thank you Lord my God what does
[53:55] revelation
[53:57] do to a Believer am it is the quickening
[54:01] power it is the essence of God taking a
[54:04] dead letter taking a Bible that is
[54:07] closed and opening it up to bring it to
[54:09] your understanding for you to know that
[54:12] he's not three Gods he's one to know
[54:16] what God is doing in this hour allows
[54:19] you by the Holy Ghost Revelation to take
[54:22] your position in the body of Christ this
[54:26] whole
[54:27] message brings you positioning and
[54:30] placing you don't belong over there you
[54:33] belong here you don't belong doing that
[54:35] quit doing that come over here come out
[54:38] of her my people hallu
[54:42] Sir Paul said later in Galatians 1 11
[54:47] and 12 but I certify
[54:50] you Brethren that the gospel which was
[54:54] preached of me is not after man amen for
[54:59] I neither received it of
[55:01] man neither was I taught it but by the
[55:07] revelation of Jesus
[55:10] Christ you can be raised up in this
[55:13] message doesn't mean you believe the
[55:17] message right
[55:20] on you must have your own personal
[55:24] revelation of Jesus Christ chist to you
[55:28] personally
[55:30] otherwise we can talk about the prophet
[55:33] said this
[55:35] that but what do you
[55:40] [Music]
[55:43] say we're not careful it becomes
[55:47] religion we become the Amish of L you
[55:50] see
[55:52] you come on yeah only thing is we don't
[55:57] drive
[55:58] buggies we drive
[56:04] cars but they look at
[56:06] us as the Amish of
[56:10] laiaa oh you people with your rules and
[56:12] your long
[56:14] hair and your women wearing dresses God
[56:17] doesn't care how you dress God doesn't
[56:19] care how you live that is Jezebel
[56:24] religion that comes from the
[56:26] the great
[56:28] Harlot
[56:30] right and she has given out the wine a
[56:35] stimulation of the wrath of her
[56:39] fornication brother Brenham says how
[56:41] does a church how does a people how does
[56:43] a person commit adultery on Christ when
[56:48] you by their intercourse of your mind
[56:51] because the mind is the wound of the
[56:53] spirit and you knowing better by the
[56:55] inner course of the Mind add to or take
[56:58] away from the word of God you are
[57:00] absolutely committing adultery on Christ
[57:03] the word and God will put you
[57:06] away as an adulterous
[57:09] woman God help
[57:12] us
[57:14] Amen in the sermon adoption
[57:19] 1960 but the purpose of this is seeing
[57:23] your position in Christ
[57:26] seeing that it's not something that you
[57:29] just stumbled
[57:30] into or something that might have you
[57:34] you you merited somewhere but it's what
[57:37] God did for you
[57:40] himself oh thank you Lord yeah somebody
[57:42] say thank you
[57:44] Jesus thank you Lord amen you just
[57:47] didn't stumble into
[57:53] it you didn't Merit it no
[57:57] not that you were so good that you went
[58:00] to a church one night that some poor uh
[58:03] brother LED you up to the altar it
[58:06] wasn't
[58:07] that it was
[58:10] God before the foundation of the world
[58:14] presented excuse
[58:19] predestinated you to eternal life thank
[58:23] you thank you Jesus
[58:26] what kind of person does that make
[58:35] you no wonder the T 24
[58:41] Elders laid off their crowns everybody
[58:43] laid down their Crown everyone fell on
[58:46] our faces they didn't have one thing
[58:48] that they could say no preacher no Elder
[58:50] no nothing all praise to the lamb God
[58:54] will gather in him somebody said say in
[58:56] him
[58:58] in thank you
[59:00] Lord God will gather in him all
[59:04] things that day and oh if we'd ever know
[59:08] and recognize who that was who they
[59:14] crucified you didn't stumble into
[59:17] this it wasn't your
[59:20] good following the law God came looking
[59:24] for you
[59:27] let me tell you this whether you know
[59:29] him right now or you don't and you sit
[59:32] here and you try to understand these
[59:34] things that I'm
[59:36] saying if you are a seed of God God's
[59:39] got an
[59:40] appointment hallelu and brother Brenham
[59:42] said God keeps all his appointments oh
[59:47] you can run but you cannot hide that's
[59:49] right you can say well it's not for me
[59:52] you can do like Jacob and be a Shyer you
[59:54] can go and hear all all the stories you
[59:56] can listen to the sermons you can go to
[59:58] church you can sing the songs of Zion
[1:00:02] you can learn the Bible
[1:00:04] verses come on that does not give you
[1:00:07] eternal
[1:00:08] life it just makes you religious what we
[1:00:11] need is to not be conformed but to be
[1:00:15] transformed Hallelujah by the quickening
[1:00:18] power of the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:00:21] to the believer yes amen and that alone
[1:00:25] is what changes you any man can change
[1:00:28] his
[1:00:29] church but it takes God to change a
[1:00:33] heart you
[1:00:36] Lord thank you Jes what makes us
[1:00:39] different than all the other churches in
[1:00:41] the valley they're singing
[1:00:45] Jesus they got their robed
[1:00:47] choirs they're sincere and I say
[1:00:51] sometimes far more sincere than we amen
[1:00:55] come on
[1:00:59] they have their Christmas programs their
[1:01:01] Easter programs they have all kinds of
[1:01:04] rock and roll groups and they get up
[1:01:06] there
[1:01:07] and Jesus and they get everybody
[1:01:10] clapping and they're all happy on it's
[1:01:14] an anointing that's
[1:01:17] right it's anointed ones at the end time
[1:01:20] it we're talking
[1:01:22] about finding the Christ
[1:01:26] of
[1:01:27] God and I'm going to expand on this
[1:01:30] thought what is the Christ of God what
[1:01:33] was it that Peter said Peter who do you
[1:01:37] say that I am now making it personal who
[1:01:41] do you say that I
[1:01:43] am many times we hear it said from
[1:01:47] another portion of the
[1:01:50] scripture Thou Art the Christ the son of
[1:01:53] the Living God blessed art thou Simon
[1:01:55] barjon

[1:04:26] and you know it's married to brother
[1:04:29] Dennis she's passed on
[1:04:32] now but she
[1:04:34] was I I forget the name of
[1:04:37] the it's
[1:04:40] like
[1:04:42] Episcopalian one of these that's a kind
[1:04:45] of a s what was it you know she was
[1:04:48] Catholic but it was another branch of
[1:04:50] the Catholic Church long story short she
[1:04:52] she she uh did all the she sewed the
[1:04:56] robes she went into the the priest's
[1:05:00] area and she cleaned the area she did
[1:05:02] all of this stuff and so she came to um
[1:05:06] church because Dennis says well I'll
[1:05:08] tell you what if I go to your church
[1:05:10] once in a while will you go to mine
[1:05:14] okay
[1:05:16] so they he kind of had her to come and
[1:05:21] so as I'm preaching she's sitting there
[1:05:24] with her arms crossed like hm I ain't
[1:05:28] listening cuz I have my church and so
[1:05:32] anyway after church she says I'll have
[1:05:35] you to know brother Ron I have my own
[1:05:38] church and I'm only coming because of
[1:05:41] Dennis and I'll have you to know I sew
[1:05:44] the priest's garments and I do this and
[1:05:46] this and this and okay okay God bless
[1:05:48] you I'm not going to try to change you
[1:05:50] you know God bless you so
[1:05:56] Time After Time she'd
[1:05:59] come off went to
[1:06:01] earrings off went this and
[1:06:04] that and I noticed there's
[1:06:06] transformation taking place till one day
[1:06:09] after service you know what she said to
[1:06:11] me Steve she put a little finger in my
[1:06:12] face what are you doing to
[1:06:14] me you're changing me I said I ain't got
[1:06:18] nothing to do with it I'll tell you you
[1:06:20] know who's doing it he your father which
[1:06:23] is in heaven giving you re
[1:06:27] I never told her to come out of that he
[1:06:29] told
[1:06:30] her Hallelujah when God calls you he
[1:06:34] says come out of that nonsense come into
[1:06:37] the truth come into the Christ of
[1:06:42] [Applause]
[1:06:44] God thank you
[1:06:49] Lord I will pour out of my spirit yeah
[1:06:54] upon all All Flesh that's what you're
[1:06:56] seeing yes the glossia of
[1:07:00] God upon the
[1:07:02] just and the unjust true the rain falls
[1:07:07] on the wheat as well as the tears and
[1:07:10] the Bible says and do they not both
[1:07:13] raise up and praise God for the
[1:07:17] rain what makes us different
[1:07:27] so when you look at the C Gene of God
[1:07:30] all down through the scriptures and all
[1:07:32] down Through the Ages they are
[1:07:35] identified as the Christ of all
[1:07:39] ages I I will substantiate that it is
[1:07:43] the works that they do that identifies
[1:07:46] the
[1:07:48] characteristics of
[1:07:50] Christ because there is no word Christ
[1:07:54] in Old Testament
[1:07:56] it says they were moved upon by the Holy
[1:07:59] Spirit Holy Spirit moved upon David the
[1:08:03] Holy Spirit moved on the prophets of B
[1:08:05] and they spake their words and their
[1:08:09] word they didn't even understand what
[1:08:11] they're saying but they were under an
[1:08:14] anointing
[1:08:19] amen God can only
[1:08:22] manifest himself in Godly attri
[1:08:26] rutes so they will have to play their
[1:08:29] part that God shows them to play do you
[1:08:33] understand
[1:08:37] it a religious spirit is a conforming
[1:08:40] Spirit
[1:08:41] yeah but a true Christlike spirit is a
[1:08:45] transforming Spirit Hallelujah a
[1:08:48] religious life is one that is Anointed
[1:08:50] by the Holy
[1:08:52] Spirit but not quickened to Life by the
[1:08:55] Holy Spirit you understand the
[1:08:57] difference oh you can go to church and
[1:08:59] there's a lot of Feelgood
[1:09:01] churches let's all sing when we all get
[1:09:05] to heaven what a day of rejoicing that
[1:09:09] will be no matter what kind of life you
[1:09:12] live when we all see
[1:09:15] Jesus but what will the real Jesus say
[1:09:18] when he sees them depart from me you
[1:09:21] workers of iniquity I never knew you who
[1:09:24] deceived them was a seducing
[1:09:28] Spirit a religious spirit spirit amen a
[1:09:32] feel-good spirit yeah come on that's how
[1:09:35] they can get their masses yeah that's
[1:09:37] how they can get the big multitudes of
[1:09:40] people because they do not preach
[1:09:42] against sin amen that's it oh thank God
[1:09:46] that this Prophet had a two-edged
[1:09:49] sword thank you Lord the word that he
[1:09:52] spake was as a two-edged sword
[1:09:55] dividing between spirit and
[1:10:00] soul amen that's how the proph could say
[1:10:03] you can have the Holy Spirit on your
[1:10:07] spirit or on your body 24 hours a day
[1:10:10] and your soul black as night and on its
[1:10:13] way to
[1:10:16] hell that's rightly dividing the word of
[1:10:21] God that's a sharp two-edged sword amen
[1:10:30] my a religious life is one that's
[1:10:33] anointed by the spirit but not quickened
[1:10:36] to Life by the spirit a religious life
[1:10:38] is one that is governed by rules and
[1:10:40] regulations of the
[1:10:43] word and it will cause people to
[1:10:47] conform but it'll never transform them
[1:10:50] for there is no revelation of the spirit
[1:10:52] to make them uh genuine
[1:10:55] from their
[1:10:58] heart that's why Jesus says they honth
[1:11:01] me with their
[1:11:03] lips but their heart be far from
[1:11:08] me in vain do they worship
[1:11:13] me it's a way of
[1:11:15] living but not a way of
[1:11:18] life a denominational spirit will cause
[1:11:21] it conforming to biblical teachings
[1:11:25] Paul is a perfect example of that yes he
[1:11:28] was a Pharisee lived a life
[1:11:33] blameless even our Prophet himself
[1:11:36] became a missionary
[1:11:38] baptist and was doing everything that he
[1:11:41] knew concerning the word of God until
[1:11:43] one day in Mishawaka I think it was and
[1:11:46] a little meeting is going on with the
[1:11:48] sign Jesus saves and he said I stopped
[1:11:50] in there and he said oh my there was
[1:11:53] people shouting and they looked like
[1:11:55] they enjoyed what they
[1:11:57] had I think you know what people judge
[1:12:00] us by the way we act if you're not happy
[1:12:04] about what you got you ain't going to
[1:12:06] sell it to nobody amen come on if you
[1:12:09] bit into something and you started
[1:12:12] eating and then you and your face
[1:12:14] grimaced and and
[1:12:17] you oh good you want
[1:12:20] some are you kidding me do I look like a
[1:12:24] fool I was born at night but not last
[1:12:27] night yeah I tell you what Christians
[1:12:30] should people should be able to see that
[1:12:33] there is something different about you
[1:12:36] not because of the way you
[1:12:38] dress because the way you dress is only
[1:12:40] a manifestation of what God has already
[1:12:43] done in your
[1:12:44] heart Jesus said if you love
[1:12:48] me amen if you love
[1:12:51] me keep my Commandments amen say that to
[1:12:55] a mega
[1:12:58] church where's the
[1:13:03] Holiness where's the justification
[1:13:06] where's the
[1:13:07] sanctification where is it well we don't
[1:13:09] have to do that you know it's all by
[1:13:11] grace and you make it nothing but
[1:13:14] disgrace see what I'm saying well why
[1:13:17] why then do you live the type of life
[1:13:20] you live because I'm in
[1:13:22] love you know love does something to you
[1:13:27] yeah love makes you go
[1:13:29] nuts does brother Brenham talks about uh
[1:13:34] infatuated he said yeah he say you see a
[1:13:37] young boy and he finds a young girl and
[1:13:40] the two that go to like one another and
[1:13:42] Sparks Fly and they get
[1:13:44] infatuated that's why even when I I I
[1:13:47] tell our young people here I said until
[1:13:49] you're engaged until you're engaged you
[1:13:51] don't get to sit next to that girl
[1:13:53] you're interested in why I'll give you a
[1:13:56] quote brother brm said my girlfriend
[1:13:58] invited me to church and he says you
[1:14:01] know what oh you know he talks it neck
[1:14:03] like a swan and oh she was such a
[1:14:05] beautiful girl he says you invited me to
[1:14:07] church I sat next to her and guess what
[1:14:10] I looked at her the whole time while
[1:14:12] he's
[1:14:13] preaching never heard a word of what he
[1:14:18] said
[1:14:20] distractions sure
[1:14:26] amen amen that's why we why that's why
[1:14:31] we teach these things amen thank you
[1:14:35] Lord Paul was identifying the
[1:14:38] characteristics of life that he was
[1:14:40] living now in the flesh for his
[1:14:42] revelation of the word is now manifested
[1:14:45] in the way that he lives his
[1:14:49] life in Galatians 2 and 20
[1:14:56] amen nevertheless I live he says I am
[1:14:59] crucified with
[1:15:02] Christ I want to ask you how often does
[1:15:04] a Christian need to crucify his
[1:15:07] flesh daily basis some of
[1:15:10] you a 100 times in that daily
[1:15:15] basis because it depends on how strong
[1:15:17] or which dog you're feeding the most
[1:15:21] right I have a quandry in my house right
[1:15:23] now
[1:15:25] I do I have a white SCH snower and a
[1:15:27] black
[1:15:28] schneer brother Ram says which dog are
[1:15:31] you going to feed so I let Becky feed
[1:15:34] the black dog I feed the white
[1:15:37] dog anyway no I feed them
[1:15:39] [Laughter]
[1:15:43] both but I just want to ask you the
[1:15:47] spirit that you feed your your soul on
[1:15:51] is identified by characteristics around
[1:15:53] you let me give you an example brother
[1:15:55] brandom said you claim to be a Christian
[1:15:57] let me go into your home let me listen
[1:16:01] to the music you listen to let me read
[1:16:04] the books you read let me look at the
[1:16:07] pictures that you look at and I'll tell
[1:16:10] you whether or not you're a Christian
[1:16:13] why a Christian identifies himself with
[1:16:16] the things and the characteristics of
[1:16:19] God somebody say
[1:16:21] Amen it does
[1:16:25] it identifies itself in the
[1:16:30] word I am crucified with Christ
[1:16:34] nevertheless I live thank you Lord yet
[1:16:37] not
[1:16:38] I but Christ liveth in me and the life
[1:16:41] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[1:16:43] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[1:16:47] and gave himself for me why do I live
[1:16:50] this life I'm in love yes amen I fell in
[1:16:53] love with Jesus Christ at 18 years of
[1:16:58] age do I make mistakes
[1:17:01] sure all the time will I make
[1:17:07] more but you know what I'm in love amen
[1:17:12] thank you Lord and love compels me to do
[1:17:15] the life and to live the kind of life
[1:17:19] and I love it I want to say I love it I
[1:17:21] do not beg grudged putting on pants
[1:17:25] every day in hot
[1:17:29] Phoenix I mean I go everywhere and all
[1:17:31] the guys that they got all the men they
[1:17:33] got well they're not really men they're
[1:17:38] male and they got their shorts on
[1:17:41] everywhere you go right they look at you
[1:17:44] you're so Str man it's hot don't you
[1:17:47] real yeah I know it's
[1:17:50] hot but what causes you to live the life
[1:17:55] you
[1:17:56] live is it a is it a
[1:17:58] conforming well our religion teaches
[1:18:02] us well then you you're you're no
[1:18:05] different than than the the
[1:18:09] amage maybe we'll start selling the
[1:18:11] little flat hats here with a little flat
[1:18:13] top on it and we'll all have to grow a
[1:18:16] beard half of you are growing beards
[1:18:19] right now
[1:18:20] anyway we're not far from that I'm not
[1:18:23] against beards
[1:18:25] in fact the first time I ever grew a
[1:18:27] beard and Flagstaff church when I grew
[1:18:29] it and come to church
[1:18:31] everybody hey look at that look what are
[1:18:33] you trying to do you know and man I I
[1:18:36] got so upset you know what I did I
[1:18:38] marched right back to my pastor I tell
[1:18:40] you what you know what Brother Floyd
[1:18:42] those guys making fun of me on growing a
[1:18:44] beard he said if you're man enough to
[1:18:45] grow up take the the razin that goes
[1:18:47] with it get out of my office
[1:18:55] yeah you w't grow a beard go it it's
[1:19:00] funny yeah everybody's got to try all
[1:19:03] the boys I should say got to try
[1:19:09] that
[1:19:14] now we find that in the midst of the
[1:19:17] anointed ones in the end
[1:19:19] time we thank God for the message of the
[1:19:22] hour because it begins to discern
[1:19:24] spirits and what's happening among us
[1:19:26] otherwise we'd be all
[1:19:28] confused
[1:19:32] right and did you know that John the
[1:19:35] Baptist they came to him and asked him
[1:19:37] are you the
[1:19:38] Christ now the scripture says in Luke 3
[1:19:41] because I I want to parallel this
[1:19:43] because it's important because we can
[1:19:45] see as it was so will it be Luke 3: 15-1
[1:19:50] 17 and as the people were in expectation
[1:19:53] and all men used in their hearts of John
[1:19:56] whether he were the
[1:19:58] Christ or not and John answered saying
[1:20:02] to them I indeed baptize you with water
[1:20:06] but one mightier than I cometh the
[1:20:10] latchet of whose shoes I'm not worthy to
[1:20:13] unloose he shall baptize you with the
[1:20:16] Holy Ghost and Fire now remember John's
[1:20:21] anointing was to get them to believe and
[1:20:24] baptize them unto repentance with water
[1:20:28] but there's a far greater one amen that
[1:20:31] John's talking about and the one that
[1:20:33] comes after me his baptism what baptism
[1:20:37] is it fire what is it holy ghost
[1:20:41] amen whose fan in his is in his hand and
[1:20:45] he will thoroughly Purge his floor and
[1:20:47] will gather the wheat into his Garner
[1:20:50] but the CHF will
[1:20:52] burn he will burn with fire
[1:20:57] unquenchable now brother brenon picks
[1:20:59] this up in the seven Church AE book page
[1:21:02] 328 and I want to W make one more
[1:21:06] comparison between the ludia and Prophet
[1:21:09] messenger and John the prophet messenger
[1:21:13] who pre preceded Jesus's first coming
[1:21:17] the people in John's day mistook him for
[1:21:21] the Messiah
[1:21:24] John 1:1 19 and
[1:21:26] 20 and this is the record of John when
[1:21:29] the Jews sent priests and Levites from
[1:21:31] Jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he
[1:21:35] confessed and denied not but confessed I
[1:21:39] am not the
[1:21:43] Christ now this last day Prophet
[1:21:47] Messenger will have such power before
[1:21:49] the Lord that there will be those who
[1:21:51] mistake him for the Lord Jesus
[1:21:55] there will be a spirit in the world at
[1:21:58] that at the end time that will seduce
[1:22:02] some and make them believe this right in
[1:22:05] fact brother Brenham when they started
[1:22:09] praying in his name and baptizing in his
[1:22:11] name he said I'm quitting the
[1:22:15] ministry and then the Lord had to show
[1:22:18] him this must come to pass because it's
[1:22:21] going to be a type as it was in the days
[1:22:23] of John and he said then later he says
[1:22:26] then I found out if it didn't happen I
[1:22:29] would have to repent of my
[1:22:31] Ministry so now we see we see a type of
[1:22:34] John and a type of this end time Prophet
[1:22:37] that there'll be a spirit that will
[1:22:39] seduce some and cause them to believe it
[1:22:42] amen if you've ever met them you will
[1:22:45] see they will tell you brother Brenham
[1:22:47] was the son of man brother Brenham was
[1:22:51] Christ in the flesh and they will go on
[1:22:55] and on and they'll say all kinds of
[1:22:56] things and they're so very very close to
[1:22:58] the real
[1:22:59] truth come on that is
[1:23:02] true in fact let me say this not to
[1:23:07] throw you off but I believe that some of
[1:23:10] them have got a closer Revelation than
[1:23:13] some of us who just call him Prophet
[1:23:16] amen because you got to
[1:23:18] recognize the messenger now the
[1:23:20] messenger is not William brandom that's
[1:23:24] right come on don't get your eyes on the
[1:23:26] man that's right it's the voice behind
[1:23:29] the voice that's right who do you say I
[1:23:32] am do you believe me to be God's Prophet
[1:23:36] oh excuse me I see that kind of stumbled
[1:23:38] you oh excuse me he says do you believe
[1:23:40] me to be his servant yes yes do you
[1:23:44] believe that what I'm telling you is the
[1:23:45] truth yes yes and then he begins to now
[1:23:48] bring the word of the Lord you see what
[1:23:50] I'm saying but they had to believe it
[1:23:53] they had to believe what what is the
[1:23:54] theme song of every message
[1:23:57] church only
[1:23:59] Bel do you know only believe is Anointed
[1:24:02] in every language in all the countries
[1:24:04] around the world I don't care if it's
[1:24:06] French German Italian doesn't
[1:24:10] matter only
[1:24:13] believe that's why it has such an
[1:24:15] anointing to it if because the angel of
[1:24:18] the Lord told him as Moses was given two
[1:24:22] signs I'm going to give you two signs
[1:24:25] because Moses said they're not going to
[1:24:26] believe
[1:24:27] me who shall I tell them sent me tell
[1:24:30] them the I am sent you but because Moses
[1:24:32] you say you need some sign I'll give you
[1:24:35] two signs a sign in the hand and then
[1:24:38] put your sand or hand here and it comes
[1:24:42] out leprosy right and gave Musta those
[1:24:46] would be two signs and and he says but
[1:24:49] they'll believe the
[1:24:51] sign
[1:24:53] after what is the sign that comes after
[1:24:55] those signs there's a voice and the
[1:24:58] voice is the sign and that's the one
[1:25:01] that you and I caught because I'll tell
[1:25:04] you what let me just say this I was in a
[1:25:08] church up in
[1:25:10] Canada when the men that made the the
[1:25:13] thing believe the sign you have all seen
[1:25:16] that believe the
[1:25:17] sign and I was in the office there and
[1:25:21] so they turned it on for me in the
[1:25:22] computer
[1:25:24] believe the sign all this in 20 30
[1:25:27] minutes later well brother Ron what do
[1:25:30] you what do you think I said I want to
[1:25:33] ask you a question which one of those
[1:25:36] signs made you a
[1:25:38] believer I'm going to ask all of you
[1:25:41] right
[1:25:43] now of the Vindicated signs whether was
[1:25:46] it the
[1:25:49] cloud was it the Halo picture
[1:25:54] was it the pillar of fire sitting on his
[1:25:57] shoulder was what what were the signs
[1:26:00] was it all of the Miracles was it the
[1:26:03] raising of the
[1:26:04] Dead come on I want to ask you which
[1:26:07] sign when you saw it you
[1:26:09] said
[1:26:11] voila now I
[1:26:13] believe I said I'll tell you what you
[1:26:16] may think I'm crazy take away every sign
[1:26:19] take away every picture take away all
[1:26:22] the healing the reason I believe this
[1:26:24] message because there was a voice behind
[1:26:27] the sign I Heard a Voice Within the
[1:26:30] Voice who was it it was the Lord Jesus
[1:26:34] Christ in fact there's one quote brother
[1:26:36] Bren said this is no longer the voice of
[1:26:38] William

[1:32:57] that remember the vision huh he grabbed
[1:32:59] him again knocked him
[1:33:03] down yeah I remember Billy Paul telling
[1:33:05] me that we was out to dinner and uh uh
[1:33:08] there was couple guys and they were
[1:33:10] cussing and filthy mouth and everything
[1:33:13] and brother Bram got up and he said

[1:33:29] filthy mouth and stuff like this so I'm
[1:33:31] going to ask you I'm a minister of the
[1:33:33] gospel and Billy Paul thought oh man

[1:33:40] boxer and you know what they said excuse
[1:33:44] us
[1:33:46] right huh stand for
[1:33:49] Christ I love the
[1:33:52] fact that there's someone that has the

[1:34:00] love my family and you guys are you know
[1:34:02] can you talk
[1:34:04] nicely while we have our food and then I
[1:34:07] don't care what you do
[1:34:08] outside amen amen
[1:34:14] amen I want to show you a quote that's
[1:34:17] really amazing Luke 4 verse 41 Luke 4
[1:34:21] verse 41
[1:34:26] and the Devils came out of many crying
[1:34:29] and
[1:34:32] saying Thou Art Christ the son of
[1:34:36] God that mean they got the Holy
[1:34:40] Ghost they were recognizing he
[1:34:44] was because the Bible
[1:34:47] says that
[1:34:49] many knees will bow and tongues confess
[1:34:53] that he is God right amen but they won't
[1:34:55] be doing it by personal
[1:34:59] revelation they'll be doing it because
[1:35:01] of the fact of the matter he is God and
[1:35:05] all of the atheists and all of these
[1:35:07] anti-religious
[1:35:09] people one day they will stand before
[1:35:12] the almighty God and every knee will bow
[1:35:15] and every tongue will confess he's God
[1:35:18] but the Bible says and they saying Thou
[1:35:20] Art the Christ the son of God and he
[1:35:22] rebuking them suffered them not to speak
[1:35:26] for they knew that he was Christ ain't
[1:35:30] that
[1:35:32] amazing so even remember in the book of
[1:35:35] Acts Paul and the disciples were going
[1:35:38] along and a woman was going behind them
[1:35:40] for three days here these men these are
[1:35:43] men of the most high God you know what
[1:35:44] most preachers would do in the message
[1:35:46] today put it in their news magazine and
[1:35:49] put a video clip on there and send it
[1:35:50] around YouTube and let everybody see it
[1:35:52] look at that God V K my
[1:35:55] Ministry I got people coming here and
[1:35:57] they saying here these men these are men
[1:35:59] of the most high god
[1:36:03] oh what did Paul do he being vexed in
[1:36:07] the spirit finally what was it is a
[1:36:11] demon what they were saying was right
[1:36:13] just like those Devils right we know
[1:36:16] Thou Art the Christ yeah here these men
[1:36:20] they're men of the most high God come
[1:36:22] out of her Satan
[1:36:25] Spirit left her and then guess what
[1:36:27] those that made money by her divination
[1:36:29] come to him oh you've ruined our
[1:36:36] moneymaking even Devils
[1:36:39] recognize the Christ of
[1:36:42] God so don't be
[1:36:44] fooled don't be fooled by signs wonders
[1:36:48] come on how about the I think it's the
[1:36:50] sermon the name of Jesus brother Ram
[1:36:52] said you you know and I've often asked
[1:36:54] myself how did Brother Brenham get
[1:36:56] himself into situations where he saw
[1:36:59] witches and wizards drink blood out of a
[1:37:03] human skull and call on the
[1:37:06] devil where in the world were
[1:37:10] you man how why were you hanging around
[1:37:13] those guys well he says how about that
[1:37:16] time he says all these people and there
[1:37:18] there came a a a tongues and
[1:37:20] interpretation there's somebody here
[1:37:22] Among Us who don't
[1:37:26] believe trying to expose him table
[1:37:30] floating in the air you remember that a
[1:37:33] table says oh it's floating several
[1:37:35] inches off the
[1:37:37] ground yeah brother brm said yeah I'm
[1:37:39] that one I don't believe this nonsense
[1:37:43] he said in the name the Holy Catholic
[1:37:45] Church tell me is this the
[1:37:48] truth tell me in the name of the father
[1:37:51] son Holy Ghost is that the truth
[1:37:54] he said now in the name of the Lord
[1:37:56] Jesus Christ tell me that to truth table
[1:37:59] fell down busted and everything like
[1:38:01] this yes I'm an I I'm a deceiving Spirit
[1:38:05] the Bible says try every spirit and see
[1:38:07] whether or not it's God because the
[1:38:09] spirit is identified by
[1:38:11] characteristics everything's identified
[1:38:14] by
[1:38:17] characteristics diseases are known by
[1:38:20] characteristics animals are known by
[1:38:22] their charact
[1:38:25] characteristics brother Braham says who
[1:38:27] watch a certain bird the way it flies
[1:38:29] characteristics a dove flies different
[1:38:31] than a quail
[1:38:35] amen everything is known by its
[1:38:38] [Music]
[1:38:40] characteristics
[1:38:42] amen
[1:38:43] false Spirits are known by
[1:38:46] characteristics
[1:38:49] also and when the body of Christ begins
[1:38:52] to become divid
[1:38:53] divided what kind of a spirit that
[1:38:56] divides and conquers what kind of is it
[1:39:00] nickan the body of Christ is united in
[1:39:04] one brother Bram says I have been sent
[1:39:07] to the bride of Christ that she might be
[1:39:10] United with the word and have an
[1:39:12] invisible Union with Christ amen thank
[1:39:16] you Lord
[1:39:19] amen so
[1:39:20] now that we are called message Believers
[1:39:24] the devil wants to come in and get us

[1:39:28] of
[1:39:29] Apollos come on come on on

[1:45:37] cuz you were under the influence of the
[1:45:39] cloud every time you come to church you
[1:45:41] are hearing Jesus said I have yet many
[1:45:44] things to say unto you seeing that you
[1:45:46] do not you cannot bear them now how be
[1:45:49] it right after I'm gone amen the Holy
[1:45:53] Ghost will come and bring all those
[1:45:57] words that I said unto you to your
[1:46:00] remembrance but if they ain't on your
[1:46:02] hard drive come on come on does not
[1:46:06] compute nothing there nothing on the
[1:46:08] hard drive that's why you may think well
[1:46:11] I'm not really getting something you

[1:46:14] Holy Spirit will Quicken you and say
[1:46:17] remember that sermon you heard remember
[1:46:18] that this remember you were reading this
[1:46:20] all a
[1:46:21] wow Hallelujah that's what we depend
[1:46:24] upon the revelation of Jesus Christ is
[1:46:27] what causes you to live the life that
[1:46:31] you're
[1:46:33] living Spirits are identified by
[1:46:37] characteristics brother Bram says an
[1:46:39] identified Christ of all ages I love
[1:46:41] this sermon every one of the prophets
[1:46:45] displays displayed God's
[1:46:48] characteristics because it picked up the
[1:46:51] word for that age and identified it amen
[1:46:55] God interpreted his word of that age
[1:46:58] through the man amen now no man can find
[1:47:02] fault with that that's the scripture
[1:47:05] well if it's always been that way won't
[1:47:08] it have to be the same today if he's the
[1:47:11] same yesterday today and forever God's
[1:47:15] interpreting his own word he said this
[1:47:18] thing will happen in a certain age and
[1:47:20] this thing will happen and he comes down
[1:47:23] and does it now he don't need no
[1:47:25] interpreting to it cuz it does it
[1:47:29] itself cuz God is his own
[1:47:34] interpreter when you read through your
[1:47:37] Bible you will see that the Christ of
[1:47:40] God is always
[1:47:42] associated with these things it will
[1:47:45] always be associated with a pillar of
[1:47:48] fire it'll always be associated with
[1:47:52] being a a Son of God it'll always be
[1:47:55] associated with being a chosen of God
[1:47:59] it'll always be associated with the
[1:48:03] Messiah amen the
[1:48:05] Christ of God you follow me
[1:48:10] amen can any good thing come out of

[1:51:28] pillar of fire that followed the
[1:51:30] children of Israel through the
[1:51:31] Wilderness that was
[1:51:34] Christ that was
[1:51:37] Christ that was the
[1:51:41] anointing wow
[1:51:44] Christ the anointing yes so it's the
[1:51:49] same anointing that led the children of
[1:51:51] Israel by the pillar of fire the same
[1:51:53] Pillar of Fire met Saul on the road to
[1:51:58] Damascus what was he meeting when he met
[1:52:01] that
[1:52:03] anointing he was meeting the Christ of
[1:52:07] God who art thou
[1:52:10] Lord I'm
[1:52:13] Jesus I am the Christ of God
[1:52:18] Amen what you have found or may I say

[1:52:26] Christ of God Amen he was looking for
[1:52:29] you thank you Lord that's why if you do
[1:52:32] not have that seed Gene in you no matter
[1:52:37] how much of the light of this message
[1:52:39] Shines on you it'll do nothing to you
[1:52:42] that's right but if you are elect seed
[1:52:45] and that light shines upon you let me

[1:53:11] of grass coming up and little cracks in
[1:53:13] the in the concrete and you got you got
[1:53:15] grass gone M I got I poured concrete so
[1:53:19] I don't have to cut grass
[1:53:23] but I have to pick grass now because
[1:53:25] there's places because guess why there
[1:53:28] is an ordained seed of grass that's been
[1:53:32] laying underneath there no matter how
[1:53:34] much of an Insurgent we put there it
[1:53:36] only lasts so

[1:53:49] sunshine guess what you got elex SE
[1:53:56] hallelujah
[1:54:01] amen sir we would see Jesus
[1:54:04] 64 this is a good
[1:54:07] quote when Jesus was on Earth he said he
[1:54:11] was a Son of God they condemned him he
[1:54:14] said why would you condemn me when I say
[1:54:18] I am the Son of God Amen when you call
[1:54:21] those who the word came to
[1:54:24] Gods Abraham was considered a god Elijah
[1:54:29] was a god Isaiah was a God because the
[1:54:34] word of God came to them amen now stop
[1:54:38] there just
[1:54:40] second if the word of the Lord came to
[1:54:42] them I want to ask you when this message
[1:54:45] came to
[1:54:48] you right what did it make you
[1:54:55] gods and you see when the man was
[1:54:57] anointed like Joseph he portrayed Christ
[1:55:02] yes he did when Moses was anointed he
[1:55:05] portrayed Christ when David was anointed
[1:55:07] he portrayed Christ all leading up to
[1:55:09] Christ he was the fullness of the word
[1:55:12] and the Word was manifest in him he was
[1:55:14] the complete anointed one we had it by
[1:55:18] portions they had it by portions we have
[1:55:21] it by portions he was the anointed
[1:55:25] one Hallelujah the entire plan of God
[1:55:28] laid in him
[1:55:31] right each one of those written within
[1:55:34] the scriptures portray
[1:55:36] Christ of their hour what is it the word
[1:55:40] identifying itself in their lives Adam
[1:55:44] was a Son of God placed in Eden
[1:55:47] identified for Christ that
[1:55:49] age he portrayed Christ in the garden
[1:55:53] it was Christ and in him as God over
[1:55:57] Eden he was a god of the earth it was
[1:55:59] Christ in him to redeem
[1:56:02] Eve see
[1:56:04] that it was the Christ of God in him
[1:56:07] playing the part as a mediator and
[1:56:08] kinsman redeemer to take Eve to
[1:56:13] himself amen that same anointing that
[1:56:16] led the children of Israel is the same
[1:56:18] anointing that's leading this New
[1:56:20] Testament Church yes we're not
[1:56:24] following a prophet per se we're
[1:56:26] following the pillar of fire
[1:56:29] amen because the prophet Moses moved
[1:56:33] when the pillar of fire
[1:56:35] moved you follow me what's amazing is
[1:56:38] when that Pillar of Fire came it put a
[1:56:41] hedge on both sides of them yes and
[1:56:45] there was
[1:56:46] light in Goan but darkness in Egypt
[1:56:50] right think of that my brother my sister
[1:56:53] God is watching
[1:56:55] over you and your family and you apply
[1:56:59] the token to your home let me tell you
[1:57:01] the devil's afraid of that token amen
[1:57:04] that's why we as fathers of our home we
[1:57:07] have a right to apply the token to our
[1:57:10] home
[1:57:11] amen you just don't close the door to
[1:57:14] your sons and
[1:57:16] daughters rooms in your house and let
[1:57:20] them live what they want want to in your
[1:57:23] house
[1:57:26] right that's how I believe it am and if
[1:57:29] they're old enough and they
[1:57:34] disagree go ahead you're my Offspring
[1:57:37] yeah spring
[1:57:39] off cuz you can't force them to do it
[1:57:42] that's right take a television away from
[1:57:45] them and they don't want it they'll
[1:57:48] resent you for
[1:57:49] it take away their Sports take away the
[1:57:52] things okay and you force them you know
[1:57:56] what you see kids that are forced to
[1:57:59] have to go to church they are forced to
[1:58:01] believe that you know what they get a
[1:58:02] rebellious Spirit
[1:58:03] about that's right it's not because they
[1:58:06] want to be there on there there's young
[1:58:10] people like that in every church I don't
[1:58:12] care if it was brother brenham's Church
[1:58:15] brother brandham says hey look if my
[1:58:17] kids start cutting up in church these
[1:58:19] are quotes brother B say if my kids
[1:58:21] start cutting up in church and they're
[1:58:22] doing wrong the deacons have a right to
[1:58:24] take them out and he says you know what
[1:58:26] I'll correct my kids at home and he said
[1:58:28] you parents you do the same thing and if
[1:58:30] your kids can't act right in church he
[1:58:32] says then keep them home until they
[1:58:35] know that's right amen somebody say amen
[1:58:39] amen
[1:58:49] obedience who do you just say this isn't
[1:58:52] Brethren if you come we're we're closing
[1:58:57] here who do you say this is

[2:03:28] predestinated Germ into him for this
[2:03:30] hour he'll see God's message as sure as
[2:03:33] there's a God in heaven Martin Luther
[2:03:36] saw it it was for
[2:03:39] his saw it for his Wesley saw it for his
[2:03:43] Pentecostal saw it for his now what
[2:03:46] about

[2:03:57] you're only manifested in this day for
[2:04:00] his honor and
[2:04:01] glory and the word of God and if the
[2:04:05] word of God was God then you were in God
[2:04:08] the word that part that you were to play

[2:04:44] I've been pondering over it for quite
[2:04:46] some
[2:04:48] time what is the Holy Ghost 1959
[2:04:53] and the same time that the nominal
[2:04:55] church was having their
[2:04:57] Revival what take taking place Full
[2:05:01] Gospel was having a
[2:05:03] Revival there come forth the Bosworth
[2:05:06] Brothers Smith Wigglesworth and Dr
[2:05:10] Price Amy mcferson all those look Smith
[2:05:14] Wigglesworth died one night Dr Price
[2:05:18] died the next morning within 24 hours I
[2:05:22] was on the
[2:05:24] field now my end is coming
[2:05:27] down you don't hear much of Billy Graham
[2:05:30] you don't hear much of Oral Roberts i s
[2:05:34] see my meetings shadowing what's the
[2:05:37] matter we're at the end another
[2:05:40] age how did Billy Sundy come in and them
[2:05:44] they come in just after the great Moody
[2:05:47] Revival when did moody come in just
[2:05:49] after knox's Revival when did Knox come
[2:05:52] in just after finny's Revival finny
[2:05:55] after Calvin Calvin after Wesley and
[2:05:58] Wesley after Luther on down through the
[2:06:00] age then come as soon as one Revival is
[2:06:03] over God raises up another and throws
[2:06:06] more light just keeps moving like that
[2:06:10] and I ask you when the prophet of God
[2:06:12] went off the
[2:06:16] scene did God go off the scene no no you
[2:06:20] know what God just changed his
[2:06:23] mask he went from one Prophet
[2:06:26] messenger into a whole bride
[2:06:30] body and
[2:06:32] now we are the
[2:06:35] mystery it's us the final voice was not
[2:06:41] Revelations
[2:06:42] 10:7 the final voice is revelation 108
[2:06:46] take the book which is open now and eat
[2:06:48] it because thou must prophesy
[2:06:52] amen it's our
[2:06:53] duty it is our
[2:06:56] predestinated
[2:06:58] will to speak the word of God without
[2:07:01] fear or favor amen God let me live this
[2:07:08] message don't let us become so
[2:07:12] divided Amen Let us become

[2:08:07] can't do it now one day I'm going to
[2:08:11] leave the world and when I
[2:08:13] leave then they'll recognize
[2:08:16] it some of you young people will realize
[2:08:19] that after I'm gone
[2:08:21] see but God would wouldn't permit it to
[2:08:24] be done
[2:08:27] now but now is the time he is permitting
[2:08:30] it we're catching it thank you Lord
[2:08:34] we're catching things greater this
[2:08:36] message is becoming greater not in
[2:08:39] number but in power and demonstration
[2:08:43] amen we're not looking for the great
[2:08:44] numbers no there's there there is a
[2:08:46] purging of the church right now huh
[2:08:49] there is a purging
[2:08:52] he
[2:08:53] always does it right before he takes the
[2:08:57] elect
[2:08:59] away because the shock is not air with
[2:09:02] the weed that's why if you can be
[2:09:05] shooken and you can be let off by some
[2:09:07] false prophet or somebody that you know
[2:09:09] what it'll happen you'll find fault with
[2:09:12] this message and then you'll be like
[2:09:13] those others he'll spit in his face
[2:09:16] you'll kiss him a judian kiss and say
[2:09:20] well there was nothing to it
[2:09:22] but he's coming soon why do you think a
[2:09:25] lot of these old Warriors are passing
[2:09:27] away right now a lot of these witnesses
[2:09:29] that have been here for years telling us
[2:09:32] when we lost brother Billy
[2:09:35] Paul of all the men on the face of the
[2:09:37] Earth he saw more Miracles more signs
[2:09:40] than anyone he was a great treasure
[2:09:43] Trove as a witness you could call him
[2:09:45] you could ask him I I did that many
[2:09:48] times brother Billy what was it like
[2:09:50] what did you do when we drove in the car
[2:09:52] together I had him for hours driving to
[2:09:56] one pastor's Church to another and there
[2:09:58] I'd ask him what was it like with your
[2:10:01] daddy when you went to pick him up what
[2:10:05] was it
[2:10:06] like he said brother Ron he said I'd go
[2:10:09] to the the door he said of brother
[2:10:11] brandom's room I'd knock on the door he
[2:10:14] said Billy if I don't come to the door
[2:10:16] it's because I'm praying and I will not
[2:10:19] interrupt my prayer to answer the
[2:10:22] door he said you wait five
[2:10:28] minutes he said and if I don't answer
[2:10:30] then you wait another 5
[2:10:34] minutes and he says and Billy when I
[2:10:36] come to the
[2:10:38] [Music]
[2:10:40] door he said if I don't talk to you you
[2:10:43] don't talk to
[2:10:45] me he said why cuz I've been waiting on
[2:10:49] God and I've got a word for to the
