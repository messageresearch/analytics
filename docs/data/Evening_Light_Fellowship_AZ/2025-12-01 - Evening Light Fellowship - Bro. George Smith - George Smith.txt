It's good to see so many out to the house of the Lord today. Uh give you a testimony, just a short testimony. Yesterday evening, I had to run over to the Arrowhead Mall to to get something. It was about 7:15 at night. I got out. I went into the mall, got what I needed, and came back. And I lost my wallet and I lost it in the parking lot. And when I got home, you know, it's about a half hour, 40-minute drive home. By the time I got home, I realized, oh, my wallet. And I realized there's only one place that would have been in the parking lot there at Arrowhead Mall. So, I said, Sandy, um, would you pray with me? I said, uh, you know, if any of you ever ever lost your wallet, it's just that, oh my, what do I do? How do I cancel? What do I cancel? All of that stuff &gt;&gt; and everything. So Sandy and I, we prayed and everything. Then I called Amos on the way there and I said, "Amos, pray with me and everything and I'm talking to him the whole time." Uh, he said, "Well, Dad, I you know, I'm closer to the mall." I said, "You don't know where it's at and everything." I said, "Well, just stay on the the phone with me." And I said, "Uh, I knew exactly where I parked and everything." Anyway, long story short, I pull up into the parking lot and there it is untouched and people walking around and and everything and I and it was opened up and everything. I thought, well, maybe the cards are gone or whatever, but it was all there. And I that's a miracle. I don't know if And so I thank God I thank God that uh that he had an angel standing over that. Not that it's that big of a thing, but you know, it can be a big thing. Anyway, uh so I'm so thankful uh for that. And tomorrow morning, for those of you that know, I'll be going in for heart surgery. Um I leave my house about 4:30 in the morning, go towards Scottsdale, be there at 5:30, check in. Procedures scheduled at 7:30. They're they're going to do what they call the taver, a transaortic valve replacement where they go through the aorta, come up, go into the heart. This is without open heart. It's not opening the chest. And so they come in there and they take this thing and they go through the aortic valve and they leave uh they open it up like a stint and then they leave the new valve. I said, "What do you do with the old one?" Well, we just plaster it to the wall of your heart and uh and and you're good to go. I said, "Well," he says, "Well, it'll take about 20 minutes and u then you're done with the procedure. Then you go into recovery and uh we keep you overnight uh just to observe you and uh you're you go home the next day." They said it'd be about two weeks for you to, you know, said you'll feel good. you'll feel more blood and and stuff. Uh but said, "But your body's not conditioned uh to, you know, go out there." Said, "Don't so kind of take it easy for the next little bit." So, um you'll be praying for us tomorrow morning, 7:30. Ask the Lord to just um have his way. And so, um also too, we have uh brother Freddy Massi is here with us. Brother Freddy is a pastor from Congo. Would you come up here, Brother Freddy? Greet the people. Just take a couple minutes, say hello to the people here. Uh, can you translate for him or who who would be a translator? Josh, who do you want translate? &gt;&gt; Come on up, Brother Freddy. &gt;&gt; Oh, are you good enough in English? You just Huh? Ah, he wants a translator, man. Brother Freddy. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, my friend. &gt;&gt; I'm happy to see you. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; I want to greet you in the name of the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Okay, &gt;&gt; it's my third time to come here in Phoenix that I'm here with. It's my joy to be back here among you. I bring you greetings from the people of God over there in Lubashi. &gt;&gt; There's a people on the other side, your brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; They believe the same message. prophet. &gt;&gt; They believe the same prophet &gt;&gt; and they believe to the same word. &gt;&gt; It's just a matter of countries and distances. But one of these days &gt;&gt; we will be together somewhere where there will be no distances. And we won't need visas to travel &gt;&gt; and they will be there together. &gt;&gt; We won't even need interpreters. Brother say that God has g us a language that will allow us to communicate. &gt;&gt; But it's my joy to be here this morning &gt;&gt; among you. Some of my believers when they come over here they attend this church of right. I also have my daughter here and his uh husband. &gt;&gt; Ask them to stand up. Uh last time asked me so the people knows them. &gt;&gt; Okay. say &gt;&gt; okay that's sister Rebecca and &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; I always love my brother Ron May the Lord richly bless you I'm happy to be here with you this morning. &gt;&gt; I love you. &gt;&gt; And in the name of the Lord Jesus greetings. &gt;&gt; I will give &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you, Joshua. Amen. Well, it's a a privilege to have brother George Smith with us today. And I had several of the saints here from the church has said, um, brother Ron, if you could just ask brother George perhaps he could give his testimony, his life story. And uh uh I had asked Brother George, I said, I've had bits and pieces of it here and there, but I said, "Feel free to, you know, we're at home. We're family. We'd love to to hear that." And so he can have a little preachimony. He can preach a little bit and have a testimony, mix it together. So, um, but first met Brother George 1973 at Spoken Word, uh, publications there and, uh, we were just, uh, me and my twin brother and brother Mitch and and brother Tom Weathers. Anyway, long story short, we were there and we met Brother George and and uh, he said, "What are you boys doing?" We said, "Well, we're just hanging out." And he said, "Well, come with me." They put us to to work and and we went over to the tabernacle and to Brandham Tabernacle and we were taking chairs and getting ready for some big meetings. Little short fella there with some glasses, kind of an older fella and everything. He said, "Do you all know who this is?" And I said, "No, I I don't." And it was brother Doc Brandham, Brother Brandham's brother. So, uh, our first introduction, uh, there was with brother George back there in 1973. And I want to say we've become good friends. And I want to say I appreciate him. He's one of the few uh, of whether it be the family or some of the older icons that is still alive and that has got a very balanced testimony. I've always appreciate that about you, brother George. he's helped to translate into the Spanish language. Many people around the world are beneficiaries of his having translated this message um into Spanish. And so without any further ado, let's all stand together. Let's sing Only Believe. Only believe. And our brother George, I'd ask him to just take his liberty and however he feels this morning, may it bless your hearts. Yes. Lonely me for all thank you only beyond. Only all things are possible. Yes. only believe and Lord I Yes Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe oh Lord Lord I need Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I &gt;&gt; let us pray. Heavenly Father we thank you for your mercy to us today. We thank you Lord that you brought each one of us from different places and here we are gathered together in the house of prayer and Lord it's good to be amongst believers. &gt;&gt; It's good to be amongst people that believe the word as your prophet brought it. And Lord here we are to go down memory lane one more time to recall your grace to me. I pray that you'd bless these words. May they be a blessing to everyone and may we go out of here better than we came in. &gt;&gt; Help us now in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; While you're standing, let's turn in the book of Acts, chapter 1. Acts, chapter 1. This is the This is the early church. This is the way it's supposed to work, you know, but we've got a lot of branches since then. But in the beginning, it says here in verse six, when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, that's the Lord Jesus, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? In other words, will you get the Romans offer back? Let us enjoy the greatness of God. And he said, "It's not for you all to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his own power, but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you. And you shall be witnesses unto me these three and a half years you've been with me. You're going to be a witness of these things right here in Jerusalem over in Judea, Samaria, and to the uttermost last part of the earth, even to Phoenix, Arizona. &gt;&gt; The gospel didn't come in a parachute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some Catholic priests brought it over here a long time ago, and now we've been restored back to the full word. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. So, as you've seen already, God is a God of variety, &gt;&gt; and I don't have all the answers. So, don't be asking questions. You ask your pastor the questions. But, um, we're glad to be here, glad to be in fellowship, and to be with Brother Ron and all of you. Many of you come from a long ways away. It's always uh a blessing to look out there and see some people I know. I've been a lot of places where I didn't know anybody, &gt;&gt; but uh I know some of you and being one of the last eyewitnesses of this great ministry. It's a great responsibility. &gt;&gt; Uh we've got good preachers, so I don't need to do that. But nobody has my story. &gt;&gt; And when we get to the other side and we're not wearing any watches or cell phones, thank you. I'll sit and listen to your stories &gt;&gt; one at a time because we all have a story to tell. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I was the eagle that was born in the Baptist chickenard. Some of you came from Mormon. You came from Catholic. Came from all kinds of stuff. And we're glad that God has revealed himself and we're right here in the word. But see, we don't have the the right or the privilege &gt;&gt; to throw rocks at the chicken yard. &gt;&gt; There's still eagles out there. &gt;&gt; Just live your salty Christian life &gt;&gt; and that will attract others. &gt;&gt; Real simple. So, I've got a long story, but we'll try to cut it down to Well, we're not going to tell you how much. Um, I have a lot of history here in Arizona. Uh my parents were they met in Los Angeles at the Bible school over there. They were married in 1944 and my mother was from Tucson. My father was from Kansas City, Missouri. They were both Americans for those who you think that something different. No. My grandfather came from New England, from Vermont. His father came from England and he looked just like me. So they graduated from Bible school and they immediately thought that the, you know, the Lord's will for them would be to go to Mexico and find this tribe that didn't have any written language and start working on the Bible. Now, see, that sounds real, real great. But first of all, there's no GPS. Okay? They they had an idea of where these people lived. And so they had an old army truck that they were driving and they drove that as far as they'd go and then they got on horseback, drove four days up in the mountains. These are newlyweds that barely know any maybe two words of Spanish. And the desire to translate the Bible is very very important because you might not know these facts, but in our world today there's 7,000 known languages. Only a few speak English. Okay. And the Bible has been translated into 750 languages and the New Testament is available in almost 1,600. So the word is getting out there. But um this is a long process. This isn't something with no computer. &gt;&gt; I mean when when Scoffield did his work over here in the Bible, there was no computers. He finished his work on January 1st, 1909 with no computer, pencil and paper. And that's what we have today. And a lot of this is very, very good. Well, anyway, um so they're up here in the mountains of Chihuahua, and they um they got to find these people. you know, they all look the same. So, they got to find the people that speak this other language and then try to talk to them and try to get some confidence going. And first thing you got to do is make a dictionary. Imagine nothing written down, only lip to ear. And so once you have a dictionary, well, then you got to teach these people to read. And then you get into St. John. And by then you might have been there 25 years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm an eyewitness that my dad didn't have that kind of patience. A lot of good ideas, but no. And so he um eventually left that work for someone else. It did get done and they um he moved over to the close to the east coast of Mexico on the you know the Gulf of America over there. And so, um, but while while they're in the mountains, now forgive me if I kind of backtracked a little bit, but Holy Ghost will work it out in the mountains, uh, being a new family. Well, there's going to be a baby born. Well, they out of the mountains instead of going to Arizona where grandma lives. No, they got on the train, went to Mexico City, where was the headquarters of the Wikliff Bible translators and that's where their first child was born in late August 1945. That was me. Okay, that's why in my big family I'm always number one. But um the um the fact is that they come back to the mountains, stayed a while. We got pictures to prove it. But anyway, now we're living on the east coast of Mexico. And uh I think I was in the it was either the first or the second grade. And so here I am the only white kid in school and all these Mexican kids. It's only like I don't know 200 miles below the border. But apparently they didn't have much experience with my type of people. So one day when I wasn't paying attention, a little friend of mine got a real sharp point on his pencil. And back then we didn't have pencil sharpeners. This is the stone age, you know, didn't have the Everybody carried a single-edge razor blade. Yeah. In their book. Very safe. No foolishness. And so when they needed a pencil, sharpen the pencil, you know. And so while I wasn't looking, he jabbed me in the arm. And then when he saw I had red blood like him, then we could be friends. Yeah. That's my first battle scar. And so we um they put me through the the sixth grade in Spanish. And at home, my mother was teaching us, you know, reading and what we needed to know for English. But she had a very strict rules. And so everything got tried out on number one and then, you know, went down to the others. And so one of the rules was you speak English in the house and you speak Spanish outside the house. Fine. That's your rule. And um so she, you know, brought us up that way. Even when when a a another American missionary would come along who spoke perfect Spanish. No, that's the kind of pig you speak English to. Little kids know these things. I've got a I had a friend back where I live. This lady owned a Chinese restaurant and she she had this little child three years old and this child already knew how to speak English and two kinds of Chinese and who to speak it to. So little kids can do a lot of things. But um my mother also taught us early on you read your Bible and pray. So when I hear William Brandon saying this years later, well I'd already been doing that. You know, it wasn't new. And so here I was, you know, the missionar's child. We got to be sit on the front row. Nobody asked us back then, do you want to go to church tonight? No. What would you like for supper? I never heard that kind of stuff. You know, you just sit down and be quiet. Uh it was a different world. So um so I'm hearing the gospel at least three times a week, you know, and it's all in Spanish. And so God was preparing something. he was getting something ready for later. And uh and so when I was uh 9 years old, I had what we'll call a close encounter with Jesus Christ because the obviously the gospel is for me too. Not just for all them, it's for me too. &gt;&gt; You know, because the Bible says in Romans uh 3:23, all have sinned. &gt;&gt; That's all the Smiths, the Brandoms, the Petersons, all of them. &gt;&gt; All sin. &gt;&gt; Keeps them. They they can't get to the glory of God. &gt;&gt; But God made a way. &gt;&gt; He sent us Paul. And Paul wrote in here, "Those that call upon the name of the Lord &gt;&gt; shall be saved." &gt;&gt; So here I was 9 years old and was baptized in the Baptist church uh in the titles like a lot of you, you know, we all didn't we all weren't born angels. No. And so that was Easter of 1955. And we're going to get to good start, good part here in a minute. So don't don't go to sleep yet. Um, so by the time I get out of the sixth grade, I um I was 12 years old and my parents decided that live with somebody else in Texas for the other six years, you know, get get a balance. And that's why I carry this level here. to remind you of balance. &gt;&gt; Not just what you eat or what you give your dog. Everything in your waking hours has to do with balance. &gt;&gt; Okay? And so I celebrate my 13th birthday in Houston, Texas with people I didn't know. But um life goes on and then uh we lived in Texas. who lived in different places and and so in January of ' 62 I had a closer encounter and I was you know a little older and um uh they sent me to live with my grandfather in Tucson, Arizona. My mother was born in Tucson. She died in Tucson. So it's a home in a lot of ways. So, here we are in the uh large school in Tucson, probably 200 kids. And I was the guy that didn't go to the parties. I didn't smoke. I didn't drink. And um and so my fellowship in school, you know, at lunchtime was with these Mormon kids that, you know, they had a prophet. Of course, I didn't know about the prophet back then, but at least they they had a a a little bit of foundation in the word. till we get to their other book and then they go that way and I say with the word, you know. But anyway, um so this was um probably 10th grade. Yeah. When I got to Tucson and I was the guy with a reputation and so finally um one day this girl comes up to me and and I barely knew her and she said, "You know, we know that you're so picky, but I don't know just the girl for you." Oh, thank you. Where is she? Way over there getting on the bus. So the next day I met Rebecca Brandham. I was raised in the Baptist church. We never heard that name before. I knew a lot of preachers, but we didn't know the name Brandham. And so um sure enough, most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. And uh so they introduced us. And so the next thing was she said, "Well, you got to talk to my dad." Fine. And all she said, "My dad's a preacher." She didn't give me no long story. And I wasn't scared of any preachers, you know, it wasn't a problem. And um so the miracle is God moved these people from Indiana to Arizona, 1,800 miles away, and he put them a block and a half from my house. I &gt;&gt; mean, it's right there, you know. God knows how to do things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, um trying to follow these notes so we can at least keep it some kind of order. Um, so anyway, I go to meet him and she introduces me and then she disappeared and here I am with this preacher, no shirt on, he's working with the bushes in the backyard. And so we talked a little bit, you know, I don't I didn't record it, but by that time, you know, here I was 17 years old and I'd already read my Bible all the way through twice. Yeah. all those genealogies and all. Yeah. That's part of God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And on your little cell phone, there's a schedule. &gt;&gt; If you start today, by this time next year, you've read the whole Bible. &gt;&gt; It works. &gt;&gt; And your prophet said back to the word over 200 times. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; so, uh, we'll try just to stick with the testimony here. &gt;&gt; Um, so any I'd read my Bible all the way through. So I I kind of knew the spirit of the word, you know, you know, like brother Ram said when he read um Tarzan, he wanted to live in the tree with the skin and you know, because it's the spirit of what you read. &gt;&gt; You see, five years from today, you're going to be the very same person. The only thing different will be the books you read and the people you meet. &gt;&gt; So anyway, talking with him a few minutes, I could see, okay, there's something different here. This man's living the spirit of the scripture. He's not trying to impress me with his new car or nothing. Just he's just a a very humble person. Uh there's no put on just what you see. So after we talk a few minutes, he gives me permission to date his daughter. Okay, that was the whole objective. So I had the victory. Amen. But he had the problem because of some other guys. They were kind of waiting their turn. She just barely turned 17 and and they were kind of waiting. But then he had to announce to people she had a boyfriend. Game's over. So um uh when he tells the story it, you know, his version is similar to mine, but um the fact is that when I was when we started dating, we're in school together, lived down the street, same bus a lot of times. And um so when they moved from Indiana, it was by vision. It wasn't by vote to the church or let's go for the weather. No, there was a vision. and you know the whole story. And so they move out there. Um this is in the middle of the 11th grade for Rebecca. Now she had been with these same people since kindergarten. Same neighbors. So this was a little bit, you know, unsettling for a young lady. And um so they didn't bring any furniture. They just brought their clothes. They don't know how long they're going to stay. Vision said go west. So here they are out west. And there's no church. There's no uh friends. There's no trees. there's no piano because every day she's she had a a small spin at piano, you know, about the size of that organ. And that's where she would practice every day because she had already been in in piano lessons for eight or 10 years in classical music. So, she'd play and Brother Brand really enjoyed a lot of the things she was playing. Well, anyway, they get out west and we don't have these things. Well, uh, the girl on the corner was, you know, became friends and her mother was a piano teacher and she had a grand piano, you know, 10 foot. And so that's where Rebecca was in her spare time. And um, and so one day, Brother Ram's getting the family together. We're going to go to supper. And there's only two kids in the back seat. Where's Rebecca? Well, she's not the corner. We'll pick her up on the way. So he goes to the corner. When he gets out of the car, he could hear the piano playing because there's two girls. That's 20 fingers on 88 keys. And they're making a lot of noise. And it's not down at the cross. It's not Shopan or Beethoven, nothing you hear. It was rock and roll. And so the other girl was at the top of the piano. She's down here in the bass. And they're having a good time. So his heart's pounding and he goes to knocks on the door. Well, they happen to hear it. She comes to the door. Now, he was a balanced individual. &gt;&gt; He didn't jerk his belt off, make a scene. No. All he said, "It's time to go." Now, a lot of times like that, he was human. He had to bite his tongue. It's time to go. So, we go. She didn't hear a word about it for two months. See, but the parents are praying now. When he tells the story, the same thing in uh August of ' 64, he paints the picture how bad the piano was. Oh, horrible. You know, she says, "But then she met George and he's a Christian." End of problem. It's his daughter. But I was taking him to the Baptist church and he wasn't glad for it. Yeah. And he went sometimes with us. So when you're on vacation, I don't want to hear this story about no place to go to church. &gt;&gt; There's churches everywhere. &gt;&gt; I can feel God a little bit in the Catholic church. or the Methodist or whatever. So, God is everywhere. Okay, you go get your little slice. &gt;&gt; Well, anyway, so we're we're going to the Baptist church and um uh the uh the first meeting I went to was in June of 63. He preached in Tucson and for the first time I'm seeing him at the pullpit. Now, he didn't give me a list of tapes to listen to. You got to read these books. No, none of that. He trusted me cuz see what I realized a little later was on that first time we were meeting it was like he was scanning the hard drive. Yeah. And so he knew who I was. He could trust me with his daughter. So don't you guys try that because your daddy ain't no prophet. Um, so at this at this meeting in ' 63, this first meeting, man, I'm just amazed. Everything he says right here in the Bible, what's what's the problem? And so when I was going home that night, I uh I was praying. I said, "Lord, this is either something comes directly from you like he's saying, or it's the biggest hoax that ever hit the planet." I mean, it was one or the other. And so God began to reveal that, you know, it's right here in the word. Yeah. No problem. So some people can look at the message and see God in action. Others see all kinds of mistakes because this isn't for everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In every group right here, there's three kinds of believers. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know who you are, but you know who you are. &gt;&gt; And what we do as uh you know, smart Americans, we look around and we start figuring out, okay, that one's unbeliever, that one's a makeeliever. That's not important. Who are you? &gt;&gt; Get yourself straightened up, you know. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, um, so what I want to tell you about is what we call the prophetic dimension. Now, you might not like that word, but it's just something that that is real because you you have like over here in the Old Testament, you got Elisha where he was in the house with his helper, guy that's helping him there, and he said, "Go look outside, see what's going on." So the helper goes outside and all he can see is soldiers with swords because they're looking for Elisha, you know, and they're and and they're upset. So he comes back, he's trembling, "Oh, we've had it. They're going to kill us." Now Elisha didn't take his belt off and whip him. He didn't smack him. He just put his hand on him, said, "Lord, open the young man's eyes." &gt;&gt; Everything was calm. He goes back out there and there all these angels. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Where'd they come from? They were there all the time. &gt;&gt; That's a prophetic dimension. Okay, it's faster than this one. &gt;&gt; And so, um, and so what happened was that then, um, in in Brother Brandham's life, that happened all the time. Now, see, if he was here and he saw these 460 people or whatever's here, he'd go home say, "Oh, we had a great meeting now. There's thousand people there." Now, it's not that he's so bad about judging numbers. It's just that he sees more than what I see, &gt;&gt; you know. So, in one one uh occasion back in January of 1950, he was in a 10 night meeting in Houston, Texas, and there's people being healed and a lot of things happening. But there was a Baptist minister that thought it was his job to prove that this is wrong. It's of the devil and so forth. And he was making a big scene. And so, Brother Bosworth, who was helping Brother Random at the time, said, "Now, Brother Ram, we got to do something. It's in the newspapers. We're looking bad." And brother Ram said, "We're not going to take you waste one night with that guy when we got, you know, hundreds to be prayed for. We're not going to waste time." So finally, Brother Brandham uh was convinced, okay, you know, Brother Bosford said, "I can do it. I won't be a problem." Okay. So he turned him loose, got the newspapers. So a bunch more people came into town to back up divine healing because Brother Ram had friends everywhere. Well, when you listen to tape, he says we went from, I think it's five or six thousand people to over here in this auditorium for 30,000. But here again, you can go check it yourself. That auditorium only had 9,000 seats. So, he's seeing a whole lot more than what we're seeing. You know, these aren't mistakes. &gt;&gt; This is a supernatural ministry from a supernatural God. And if you don't believe in the supernatural, you're sitting in the wrong church. &gt;&gt; Okay? So, they have the debate. Brother Random was going to stay in the hotel. Now, you probably know most of this, but I'm telling you from a different angle. He says, "I'm going to stay in the hotel. You guys have at it, and I'll be back tomorrow night." So, the Holy Ghost says, "No, you must be there." So, he gets ready. He comes to church. There's him and his wife, his brother, and four-year-old Rebecca. Now, he says he came into the service disguised. I don't know what he was wearing. He never explained that. But nobody knew he was there. Okay. And he goes way up in the balcony where he could see directly to the pulpit. And he's sitting up there and he's watching the goings on down here at the pulpit. And so, Brother Bosworth says to the to the Baptist, "Now, sir, in the Old Testament, we have we have seven compound names of redemption of Jehovah." Yes, that's right. Now, can we apply those to Jesus Christ? Yes or no? Well, the Baptist had to think a minute because if I say no, there's no salvation. And if I say yes, then it includes divine healing. &gt;&gt; And I don't know about now, but at that time they they wouldn't allow divine healing to be in the atonement. So all this is not right. Well, anyway, so they had the debate. They, you know, didn't get ugly, but it's just they had some words. So finally, brother Bodsworth said, "Now we we don't know if Brother Brand was here." It's like here. I I can't really point somebody else. I can see some of you, but if there's 10,000 people or more, who knows who's out there? He said, "If brother Rand was here, he's welcome to come down. Dismiss the audience." So, Brother Brham gets up from his chair. Now, before that, he's got Rebecca on his lap, just like some of you guys hold on your little girl. Well, this is the first time that Rebecca got to sit with her dad in church because all the other times her dad's up here and all the other little girls are sitting with her dad and she was, you know, feeling left out. So, when he gets up to come down here, he puts Rebecca in in his seat and she always said she could remember seeing the souls of his feet as he went down the steps. Okay. So, he comes down to the um platform and the Baptist had a couple of of uh professional photographers over here because he wants pictures because he's going to win. He's going to show these pictures and so forth. And so, they're taking pictures, but when Brother M describes it, he says there was all these people. Now, a lot of them were sick people. See, most of us here are well. We had a good breakfast. We drove church, a nice car. Well, back then 1950, it was a different story. If you were sick or you had your mother sick or whatever you had pro wrong, you want to go where the man of God was. &gt;&gt; So, here's all these people. He said there was cases there that would make the heart of an iron man melt. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, he said 500 ushers made a path for him to come down here. Okay? Because everybody want to touch him. Well, he gets down here and says a few words and um and he said, "I don't need to say anymore. He's present." I don't know if you guys have the picture back there. Can you put the picture, the halo on the screen? Because the only picture that came out of that whole evening was the one picture. They went to develop their pictures. Only one came out. And so, um, Brother Ram said, "It's better for you to have this picture than if the real thing came in the room &gt;&gt; because your eyes could deceive you, you know." &gt;&gt; And so, in another place, he uh he's praying. He's preaching and and he's got this prayer line and here's this lady with with this picture. And so, in order to establish contact, he starts talking to her. He says, "You know, let's talk about that picture." He says, "On my desk at home, I've got a testimony of a lady that was in the hospital and she was dying. They didn't give her up." And so, she's there and on the nightstand next to the bed is the, you know, the Houston picture. And um and so her testimony was that while she's praying, the light came off of the picture and stood over her and she got well and went home. &gt;&gt; And that's happened several times that I've heard it since. So eventually they'll find the picture and yeah, but anyway, the uh fact is the moral of the story is years later when Rebecca's listening to the tape like we do, um she hears him tell these facts and she says to her mom, "Now mom, you're the only one there that I remember. Did you see those 500 ushers?" "No, dear. Those were angels, &gt;&gt; just like in the days of Elisha." &gt;&gt; And they're here, too. they're just in a faster dimension. We don't need them right now. Okay. So that's that's the prophetic dimension. And um so we're still 1963. And so when the Okay, there's the picture right there. So if you don't have that picture, you need to get it &gt;&gt; somewhere. Um thank you. So in December of 63, the Brandoms are going to go away to Indiana for two weeks. But you know, when you're young and you're full of life and you're in love and your girlfriend goes away for two weeks, well, two weeks a time, you know, you know, thump. And so I caught a ride with some other people and it was just a miracle we made because it drove straight through, you know, 30 hours. Anyway, we got there early Sunday morning of uh December 29 and I uh you know surprised him. So, here I am in the Brandon Tabernacle first time. Wow, all these people. And of course, the man's got plenty of liberty at the church at the tabernacle and he um he's preaching. Well, when we went to lunch that day, he uh he knew that we were, you know, in school together and he knew that we were in music and that I was helping lead singing at the Baptist church. So, at lunch, he says, "Now, George, I want you to sing tonight." I said, "Me singing Brandon Tabernacle?" Yeah. Yeah. What would I sing? Well, he said, "Now, tonight we're going to have a prayer line. So, it'd be good if you could sing Then Jesus Came." Well, I didn't know that song. you know, hadn't heard it in the Baptist church, but um I learned it that afternoon and sang it and he was very pleased and he was pleased that his daughter was playing for first time in church and then he preached the uh looking away to Jesus. Yeah. Looking away to Jesus. That was December 29th, 1963. Well, time progresses and we graduated together in May of 1964. So, you probably already figured out my age, but it's okay. Uh, at my age, I can repeat sometimes. You know, when you're younger, you can't do that. And I hope the translators are getting this for the see. Okay. So uh so we we graduate in ' 64 and our parents are in the you know in the audience happy day and brother Brandham made the comment at last a Brandom has graduated because nobody finished school before that you know well in July of ' 64 he was preaching in Philadelphia um and so when you went to church with brother Brandham uh you'd get there late he he got there in time to come to the pull pit So when they got to this big auditorium, every seat's taken. Well, here's Brother Brandham and Billy Paul and the two girls, Rebecca and her friend Betty. Well, there's no seats. So they found him a couple seats up in the mezzanine where they could see. And um so they're up there. When Brother Ram comes to the service, there was a long table, you know, parallel to the uh to the pulpit. And his chair was right right beside the pulpit. brother or Roberts was speaking and he was going to be next. So, while he's sitting there, um he uh he looked down and he saw that his pants didn't match his his coat, you know, and so he reaches over very carefully and he he feels brother or Robert's coat, you know, it's like that real real gently. And uh then he gets up and he preaches the the mighty message, you know, the mighty God unveiled. Well, when they're going back to the hotel, Rebecca said, "I saw what you did." He said, "Oh, sis, you wouldn't believe the suit. It's probably $1,000 silk, whatever, you know, 1964." And he looked down and he didn't match. He had the brown coat and the black pants or whatever combination, but it didn't matter. It was clean. You know, his his outfit was probably $49.95. And but what's the point? Both men are called of God. &gt;&gt; One had to have everything goldplated perfectly. You know, the other one was more important what he had to say. &gt;&gt; And he he liked nice things, but he didn't have to have the best, you know, just let's get it done, you know. Well, in another occasion, he's preaching, and you'll find this on tape where that um he's in a big auditorium, you know, big curtain behind him. And so he gets to the end of the services and I want to show you all what is the secret of the success of these meetings. So they raise the curtain and there's old John Ryan with a little white beard out flat on his face praying. He said that's why we have success in these meetings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Rem didn't have a push button ministry. See we like to think that because you know we're 60 70 years later but uh as one that was there no he struggled all the time. He walked by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. when he when he was going to preach the seals. Okay, he's been preparing for it. He studied, but he still didn't have all the answers. When he's on the way to the pulpit for the first service, he said that he stopped by Billy Paul's office and said, "Billy, if you ever pray for dad, pray now. I don't know what I'm going to say to these people." &gt;&gt; And they're all waiting, you know. And so even when he's when he's preaching the seals, he he's getting through this service, no clue what's coming next, but he he walked by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One step at a time. &gt;&gt; So don't think that God's going to show you three miles ahead. No. &gt;&gt; For today, &gt;&gt; stay balanced. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, um Okay, we got to tell you something about the courtship. Yeah, because that's important. Um, I wasn't dating the prophet's daughter as such. This was the daughter of William Brano. We were good friends. He was a good preacher. I didn't know all that I know today. Okay. I was focused on the girl and everything was working just fine. But we had to we had to be in by 11 o'clock. We couldn't be out, you know, late or couldn't be on on certain nights of the week and so forth. Now, um, when we moved into our house down the street, we had a black phone on the wall with the dial. Everybody over 50 remembers those, right? Okay. We're over here in the antique shop. And, uh, so when Brother Ram got his phone installed in ' 63, um, it's a it's a desk phone and it's push button, but it's still, you know, there's a receiver. You couldn't walk away with it. It's plugged to the wall. And so people found out about his number and they would call him for everything, you know, the white car or the red car. They see me and Ron, we'd say, "Who cares?" But he was kind. He would be nice to people. But he had enough of it. So one day he's looking at the phone and he turns it over and there's a dial on the back of that phone. And you could dial it one way and the ringer got louder. You dial it the other way and the ringer call goes off. &gt;&gt; Well, that was the easy solution. So, he can't hear it. Now, if I'm calling up there, I could hear the phone ring, but he can't hear it ring. And so, he's got it off. And so, Rebecca says, "What are we going to do?" Now, we were teenagers. We had teenage brain. we didn't have these little guys, you know, and so we um we didn't uh we didn't have the the things we have today, but we only lived a block and a half away, but we like to talk on the phone. I don't know why. It's just the way it is. And so, um uh she said, "What are you going to do?" Said, "Look, it's real simple. See, man, we always figure it out, right?" said, "Let's go line up our clocks." Exactly. Right. Okay. Same time. Now, at my house, I had younger brothers and sisters. I had to figure out a good time when my dad was busy watching ball game or something and I didn't have access to the phone. So, I said, "At 7:00, I'm going to call you." Now, thanks to your dad, there's no ringing, but uh at 7 you pick it up, I'll be there. So, she picks it up. Hello. And since it had a long cord, she could take this phone into the, you know, closet and shut the door and we had a little privacy. You see, love conquers all. So sometimes, brother Brandham would offer us the use of his Cadillac. Now, back then that was the best on the market. Okay, today you have many choices. Cadillac ends up being one of the uglier cars, but back then it was a real nice car. So, I had a Ford truck and my Ford truck was two doors, no hair, no stereo, you know, three-speed, real simple. And so, sometimes he would offer his Cadillac. Now, why did he have a Cadillac? Okay, the Christian businessmen that loved him, they wanted him to have a new Cadillac every year. He said, "No, station wagon's fine for me." But finally when brother Arganbright out in California was getting delivery of his 56 Cadillac, he gives the keys to the 55 Cadillac. Okay, you guys drive this back there to this address. Park it. Give them the keys. Don't talk to anybody. Leave. So they left it. It's parked there. Well, brother Ren comes back from trip someplace. What's this big blue and white card in my driveway? And so his wife said, "Well, these guys left it here." Well, he puts it in the garage and it sat in the garage for several months until he put a little disclaimer in the newspaper. This isn't worth your money. This is a gift, you know, and they drove it everywhere after that. So, anyway, so they got this station wagon and they got this Cadillac. Any of you know about cars? They're about 30 ft long, had had a big V8 engine, two four barrel carburetors. It was a nice car, good air conditioning. And so when he said, "Uh, take my car." Said, "Well, thank you, sir. Park the truck, take the car." But see, the car had we had to put the expensive gas in that. See, I could I could fill my tank with uh gasoline at like 23 cents a gallon. This is way back. But and there was no self pump. No, you had to have the guy come out and do all that. But the car you had to put in the gasoline. It was 36 cents a gallon. So, we get $2 at a time, you know. Well, um those are some of the the trials we went through, but you know, um so here I am in this Ford pickup and we're going to church and we um stopped by to get Rebecca. Well, I'm driving and there's Rebecca and my sister. And then in the back was three or four brothers and sisters, you know. And so he'd come out to say goodbye to us and he said, "My, what a fine truckload of preachers you have here." I didn't see any preachers, just little brothers. You know how little brothers are. They're in the way. And um time passes. Sure enough, all four of them went through Bible school, had missionary church. They're all good Baptist preachers because see, I was the first, but eventually there was five boys and five girls. Yeah. And so, um, yeah, sometimes brother Rand would, you know, go to, uh, go to church with us. He he lived here in the word. Now, by the end of ' 64, the Lord says to Brother Random, you you need to find a house. You're going to stay. You know, this is not temporary now. You can stay. So, they started looking for a house. The businessman offered him a house up here in Phoenix. I think at the time it was worth like 100,000 or something. And he said to me, "Now, George, how can I live in a house like that? Big fancy driveway, big house, and people come in a little shibby to be prayed for. That won't work." And so the Lord directed him to the house that many of you know about there in Tucson. And so it was a house that was almost finished. The guy built it a year or so before and he didn't quite finish. It didn't have any carpet and a few things. You know, he'll leave that for the the owner to do as they please. So, Brother Rem's making the deal and he's standing in the doorway looking out and he loved this property because they had space out here to put the dinner room he always wanted, put his trophies in, so forth. And so, he's standing in the doorway and the own the builder standing outside looking in. And so, they're they're discussing the price and everything. Well, in the meantime, here's here's Joseph about eight years old and he's he's running his hand up the door jam. You know how kids do. And so, Brother Ram doesn't take his eyes off the guy. they're talking and so all of a sudden he goes in his pocket and gets out his knife and sticks it in the hole there where the lock is and out comes a scorpion. So he he he could see that well in another dimension. He wasn't looking at it. But those kind of things were common with him. Okay. Um there was a time when Rebecca was telling us that they were in a in a restaurant and they were u having lunch and there was um a policeman another table and as soon as the policeman's food came well his radio started making noise. He had to jump up and leave and the lights are flashing and so uh you know brother Brent's still eating. He said nothing to worry about. He said over there a few blocks little boy fell out of a tree and broke his arm but he's going to be okay. So Rebecca said, "Now we knew everybody's daddy didn't do that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, um, so all during the end of ' 64 and ' 65, they're um they're working on this house, you know, finishing it, doing details. And so in ' 65, um, I guess I was real brave at the time. Uh, I didn't have baptism right yet. Didn't have the Holy Ghost. Didn't have a job. Didn't have a car. Oh, yeah. I did have a car. And so anyway, we talked and so it's time for me to go talk to the man. So I had to find time when he's not busy and I could talk to him. And I said, "Now, Brother Bram, um, I'm here to talk." So he starts talking. Well, he knew I was there. So he starts talking. We we'd run around the world. He did all kinds of different things. And so finally I said, "Now, Brother Bram, all this is beautiful, but I'm here for a purpose. What would that be? Well, you must have noticed that I I really think highly of your daughter. And so, I'm here to ask for your permission and your blessing to be married. And he's got the eyes got rather narrow. He said, "Look, George, I'll give you all permission to be engaged, but don't even think about marriage until you both have the baptism of the Holy Ghost." So, that's good for today also. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so, uh, I said, "Thank you, sir." Life went on. Now, a smart person would have been on their knees, right? But what's next? Well, God had a way of doing things. &gt;&gt; And so, um, in July, here they go away again, you know, and I don't know how I got there, but I was there for like 10 days or two weeks to Indiana. And so I was there when he was preaching the anointing once at the end time and some of those powerful messages there in July 64, but it was kind of going over my head, but I I was there. I I saw. And so on August 1st, he preached in the morning and then it must have been after the evening service. I asked him, I said, "Now before we get in the car to go back to Indiana, will there be time for you to baptize me correctly?" Oh, sure. So, Monday afternoon, um, August the 2nd, uh, we went to the church and he baptized me in Christian baptism. Okay. So, turned out that was the last person he baptized, too. You know, we found out later. Um, so I were back in in Tucson, August of ' 65, and I had the had the baptism, right? I had the car, had the girl under contract, you know. So, we're making progress and um so we're driving around in my car and he boy this is nice. It was just me and me to you know but anyway he liked it. So out of seemed like out of nowhere he said now now George if you ever have a chance to go to Israel your Bible will be a brand new book. Well I wasn't thinking about the book. I wasn't thinking about Israel. I was thinking about the girl. But that's what he said. Well, I don't know why, but in, you know, eight years later in 73, we made our first trip. Sure enough. Wow. Very different. And um so in 2023, you know, two years ago is trip number 48. And the Lord Terry's will have a trip or two this year. So there's plans. Well, um, here we are, August of 65 and, um, they're finishing the house. It's looking good. Got the driveway in, carpet, and different things. Well, Brother Perry Green was, you know, thinking seriously, moving to Tucson. But at home in in Texas, his mother was a seamstress, and so he'd already taken some measurements, and she was making curtains for this new house. So, he's in town to, you know, put up the curtains. And um uh so while he's there, he had a couple of services that rented a place, but um you know, I'm I'm just a teenager. I'm not really involved in a lot of things. So during that visit, Brother Brandon says to Brother Green, "It looks like this kid's going to be my son-in-law. Please take him home and pray for the Holy Ghost." Okay. Well, now you all know Brother Perry. Most of you do. He's bigger than life. And uh you know the way he was talking I thought I was on vacation big ranch house you know and pool and whatever. No such luck. No I go with him. We get to Bulmont Texas very hot humid. He lived in a two room house behind the church and my room didn't have air conditioning. And anyway so and I didn't know why I was there. Nobody told me I was going over there for the Holy Ghost. I was on vacation, you know. Anyway, um so about the second day I'm there, Brother Richard Blair came over from Louisiana to use Brother Green's phone to call Brother Brandham in Tucson. And so when he called, Brother Brandham was already out of the house, but they put his name down. He'll call you as soon as he comes back. Okay. So they're there waiting for this phone call all day. I'm over in my room reading my Bible. And somehow I felt inspired to go over there and see if the three of us could pray together. Okay. So, we're kneeling in the bench praying. While we're praying, um the um what I could see in my mind was a was a cloudy day and then streams of life come through, some sunlight coming down like pencil, you know, that's what I could see in my mind. Well, soon after that, the phone rings. Well, it's Brother Brandham calling for brother Blair. Brother Green answers his phone. Oh, just a minute, sir. He, brother Bram says, "But first, let me talk to George." Okay. So, greeted him. He said, "I want to be the first to congratulate you on receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost." Well, I knew something was happening, but he knew how hard-headed I was. So, he was explaining to me what what just happened. And from then on, it just got bigger and bigger and bigger. You don't get it all at one time, but that's how it started. Well, the next day I get a call from my mother also in Tucson and she said, 'We have a letter here from President Johnson. They need you in the military. Okay. So, I come back over here and uh within a week I was a US soldier with the Holy Ghost. So, so far so good. Um, so now I'm in I'm I'm in Louisiana in basic training and finishing up the first six weeks of basic training down towards Thanksgiving. And um, Brother Brandham's preaching up in Shreport. It's just 80 miles away. So I got, you know, pass and Rebecca drove down, picked me up, go to the services. Well, on Saturday, I had some time with brother Brandham and I was burdened because here I'm, you know, I have no no uh, training yet. It's just basic. I don't know if they're going to make a soldier and kill people. What I'm going to do? And so um he um uh he wasn't real busy Saturday morning. And so I I just expressed myself, you know, briefly. He says, "George, don't worry. Footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. No prayer, no nothing." Well, good. That took the burden off me. He he called me a righteous person, so that's all I needed, you know. And um anyway, just quoted the scripture. So in December of ' 65, I was home for several weeks, you know, free from the military. I remember helping him put some of the beds together for the house cuz he wanted to get it all done because the plan was that they were going to go to Jeffersonville, preach, pick up the new car, and come back. And so in the meantime, Rebecca was going to stay in town, move stuff out of the apartment into the house so they come right to the new house. Okay. Now, he didn't trade cars because he was, you know, uh, egoomaniac. No, he traded cars because of high mileage. And if he didn't know about cars, you look at them, you don't know which one's the new one because he kept it perfect condition. Well, so the idea was to leave on the on Saturday the 18th to drive back. Now, when he um when he traveled, sometimes he drove by himself. Yeah. A lot of two-lane roads. And so, he liked to leave early. 6:00. He's he's moving. You all can go to sleep. No problem. We're going to get there today. And so, he would leave early. And um he had certain certain rules. If it was just him by himself or with Billy, he would dress in blue jeans and boots and didn't matter. But if he was with family, he would dress a little nicer. Maybe not a tie, but you know, nicer. And the the Bible was always the last thing into the suitcase because you don't put anything on top of your Bible. &gt;&gt; And if you listen close enough, he tells you, "Not even my books." So, I better not see anything on top of your Bible. &gt;&gt; Anyway, those are his rules. So, I wasn't going to get up at 5 in the morning, say goodbye. I went the night of the 17th to um you know to say goodbye to him and so we're in the bedroom by ourselves and we're talking and I noticed on the chair by the door was his boots and his blue jeans and and such was his rules, you know. I said, "Well, what's this all about?" He said, "Well, a guy never knows when he might have car trouble." Well, I knew this guy never had car trouble, but I never said a word. He didn't say a word, but within 24 hours he'd been in a head-on collision, almost died. And um that was on the night of the 18th of December. And so we made it over to the hospital in Amarillo by Sunday, the next day. And people started to gather. Remember, no cell phones, only a phone on the wall. You got to put coins in it. Didn't take credit card. And so people are starting to arrive. They want to know. They want to investigate. Well, he's back there in ICU where there's 12 beds. He's all wrapped up. Can't talk, can't see, has a trachea. And I got in to see him once during those few days just to pray and and you know because you got 10 minutes. Well, in the waiting room there was a lot of people, a lot of opinions. Some sounded better than others, but um over here to the side was a Mexican family. And I go over there and start talking to them. Well, it turns out that in the head-on collision in the other car were four Mexican brothers, men, probably not related. One died on the scene and the other three were in the hospital. And this was the parents of one of the boys. Okay. And so we talked a little bit. I don't know what we said, but years later, come to find out they u they'd been telling people, "Yeah, our son, you know, he he was in the hospital. We we talked to brother M's son-in-law." Well, that boy eventually became a Pentecostal preacher and his son is also a preacher. I've only heard about him. I've not got to meet him yet, but um the boy himself that was in the wreck, he's already passed on. uh you never know when you see and talk to people where it's going to produce, you know, &gt;&gt; and so God knows the he knows the score. He knows who's who. He's got the right people at the right place. And so during these days, you know, there's a lot of confusion going on. And um uh finally during those six days of brother Rams in the hospital, the other 11 beds in ICU improved, went home. But on the night of the 24th of December, the Lord said, "That's enough. Took him home." We weren't planning on that. That wasn't part of the idea anybody had. You know, even though when you look back, he makes little hints here and there about leaving, but you know, we hadn't caught that because see, back then there was no cassette tapes. There was no It was reals. It took It took some effort to put the tape on, listen to it, and all uh it wasn't like it is today. You see today everything brother Ram said is on every cell phone on the planet in more than one language. So there's no excuse. &gt;&gt; But um so or took him and the next day we arranged to have um they arranged for a couple of ambulance planes where you put you know a bed in each one and we flew back to Jeffersonville. I had to get back to service because I wasn't a blood relative. couldn't stay for the funeral. But the fact is that they had the they had a funeral, but the family couldn't decide where they should bury him. Should it be here in Jeffersonville or over here in Tucson where the new house is? So, the funeral director said, "Don't worry. I got a place to I can keep him." And uh you all um when you decide, let me know. And so, um, we were like the the disciples, you know, when the Lord left. What do we do now? We were on this trajectory. Now he's gone. And but God has a plan. &gt;&gt; You see, most of the people, cuz I was there, most of the people were just watching for the miracles. Okay, how many miracles do you need? You know, weren't listening to what he said. And so now, oh, start listening to what he said. And of course, the printing started up and everything. In the meantime, I'm back in Louisiana in uh in school, learning how to cook for hundreds of people. And uh Rebecca's learning how to take care of her mother and her brother and sister. And you know, when I wanted to call, I had to stand in a long line because like there'd be 10 phones on the wall and 10 lines. People want to use the phone. It wasn't like it is today. Well, finally we get to March of ' 66 and um and I knew what God had done for me. I knew God had done something for Rebecca and I knew I was leaving, you know, in April. So, I said, um, let's get married next Wednesday, March the 30th, 1966. So, we had a private wedding at the house, just our family, and we took off on a honeymoon to Indiana. And so, um, uh, we knew that by then they decided, okay, we're going to have a burial in Indiana. So, we we drive back there and, uh, Monday, April the 11th was a was a just a gentle rainy day. Just wouldn't go away. And so, we're gathering for the burial. And Billy Paul had always kept contact with his grandmother. That's Hope's mother. and she was a very difficult person. Never expressed too much, never went to church. So on the way to the burial, he leaves his two little boys, like three and two or whatever they were, very young with grandma. Goes to the burial, comes back and for the first time in his life, he sees grandma wiping her eyes. And she said, you know, even the heavens weep for that man. So that was that was what happened on that Monday. We flew off to California and on the 15th of April I flew off to Vietnam for one year. Yeah. I was one of the survivors. I wasn't one of the 52,000 died. And so um here I am working in a like a field hospital um for a year but we're watching the calendar you know and there was no FaceTime. There was no vacation. No, nothing, no phone, only letters. They're written two weeks ago. So, that was a trial by fire, but God's watching over him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watching what's going on. And um so I get back, finished off my two-year commitment, and in October of ' 67, I started working with the printing of the message in Spanish, which some other people had tried and they' left off a paragraph and there was some problems. So, I basically had to start from scratch. And that's where we started and started, you know, getting it right because see like right here, we listen to an English tape. Those of you that understand English, we listen to an English tape and we feel the the anointing. We we we have a certain thing it produces in us. Well, it's only logical that these people over here in Spanish or French or whatever should feel something similar when they hear it. &gt;&gt; You know, we can't it's there's no such thing as word for word. Look, look in your Bible in Luke and Jesus said, which means well, it's a lot fewer words for one thing. So, it's not word for word. It's it's the expression of what's being said. Just like you saw the two translators up here, two people up here just now. He wasn't saying every word. He said this is what he said. You know, so that's what we've tried to do is to get the message into Spanish to where they can be anointed with the same spirit as the English. You see, obviously we were use all the words we can, but see, um, like brother Random, I think I can find it on tape, but there's a saying in English, uh, I was tickled to death. Well, we all understand what that means. We don't need an explanation, but if you're going to translate word for word, oh well, he scratched himself till he died. I mean, it's silly, but that's what you get, you know. And we have a and brother has a lot of American sayings. They're not even in the dictionary. &gt;&gt; You have to know his There's some things I never even knew what he meant till I got back to Indiana and talked to some other people. You know, when he says, "I pack the water." Well, you pack a suitcase. What do you mean pack the water? What? You carry the water? Uh, in English, he says, "Uh, the oddball." Well, we kind of know what that means. What's wrong with the ball? So we use odd bird. Oh, perfectly understood. So anyway, I translated a small track which is a brief u portion of his um his life story. He ascended on high and gave gifts unto men. I translated that when I was still in high school. He liked that. Well, anyway, while he was building the house, while they're finishing up the house, um the dinner room's up, you know, just getting up and he's getting the animals and all that. So he knew I was bilingual. So he asked me one day. He says, "Now, how do how can I say uh eagle's nest in Spanish?" So I rattled it off. Oh, I can't say that. So you have to write it down. So I wrote it out for him. Years later, I come to see puts it on the door of the dinner room. You know, that's where that came from. Well, um, so the the message is getting the Spanish, getting some other languages. So that takes a lot of years. So we're going to fast forward to 2002. Okay. By this time, we're living in Tennessee and Rebecca was feeling very bad. She had some kind of pain. She didn't know what it was. She couldn't touch it and no doctor would look at her. Wouldn't give her the time of day. Finally, she found a doctor that would, you know, take care of her. Well, she had a large tumor on the kidney. And um so in 2002, that was operated on. Of course they they watch you after that you know see where else it could develop and it it came up in the lungs and so by 2006 uh she had been to many hospitals and we were out here in Tucson and so um you know this wasn't just anybody this is somebody lived with William Rener for 19 years she knew more about faith and miracles than I knew and um so uh we're believing we're see these things declining every day, you know, and so there's all kinds of people praying, people in other countries. So when he lack of faith, when he lack of of prayer, but um one day in October of ' 06, a little sister called us from back in West Virginia, a friend of the family, and she said, "Now, I was getting up from the table today at noon, and there's a vision right there." He said, "I can see brother Random. I see all these people. Saw the prayer line. He's preaching faith." And then he says, "And you little sister, thank you for praying for my daughter Rebecca. Tell George everything will be okay." Well, might not be the way I want it, but it's going to be okay. No problem. And so on November the 28th, which is just like two days ago, 19 years ago, the Lord took her. And after that, I remember praying, Lord, keep me focused and balanced and busy. So, I've been very busy and uh we're trying to stay balanced, but focused on the resurrection. &gt;&gt; See, that's the next thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it's a lot easier today to believe what Brother says, it's only going to be a few than it was 50 years ago. Oh, all these believers and all these books. Well, I'm not so sure anymore. &gt;&gt; We got a lot of opinions. A lot of stuff doesn't match anything in the Bible. &gt;&gt; What do you expect? &gt;&gt; Well, we were married just over 40 years. We have three children. One lives in Tucson, two live in Tennessee. We got three grandchildren, and one great granddaughter. Yeah. So, we just had some pictures with the four generations. But you know your neighbors and the people at the gas station, the people, grocery store, they're watching your life. &gt;&gt; Now, we don't we don't dress just to be seen. &gt;&gt; You ladies are dressed a certain way because that's the way you're taught and you know it's right. And so, um, Jesus said, "By this shall all those people know that you're my disciples because you're carrying the Bible." No. All people in Phoenix care because you got a nice belt block all hole. No, because you carry the prophet's picture. No. Love one to the other. &gt;&gt; And that's what I see here. &gt;&gt; We got people from every place. I mean, Saskatoon of all places and all kinds of people that are gathered because we love each other. &gt;&gt; We love the word, you know. &gt;&gt; And so a lot of times I um I'm questioned about things. I don't run away run away from any questions. I was in Congo more than once and I was in this one church and there's at least 5,000 people there and there's no drywall. It's all concrete, you know. So, I'm speaking with the translator into the other language. So, as soon as we get done, well, first of all, when you're speaking to this crowd, u you don't tell them now, let's turn over to First John. I notice there's no Bibles. Well, I'm thinking, well, it's Africa, poor people. So, I give the pastor and I, you know, we want to help. We don't need help. We have money. We built this church with our money, no dollars. He said, "The problem is they sell Bibles right there. But the problem is these people can't read." Why? Because this is a diamond area. You can't just drive over there. You got to fly in only with an invitation sealed and all that. So when kids are five and six and eight years old, they're out there digging for diamonds. A lot of them can't read. They don't need books. They don't need, you know, uh, Bibles. They need a preacher. &gt;&gt; They need they they got to hear it firsthand. So that was kind of the what was into. And so this brother, the pastor jumps up. He said, "We don't know when, brother George is coming back. Would there be any questions?" Yeah. 5,000 black people and me. And so they look at me and well they start writing out the questions, you know, come up and they got to translate the question. They got to translate the answer. Well, this goes on and on. They're not hungry. Here's 5,000 people and outside there's 10 cars and there's probably uh 200 motorcycles and about 500 bicycles. Everybody else walked. So they're not going to be correct. Well, the only question I remember the sister sent up a question. Well, since the Lord took your wife, why you still wearing the ring? Wow. People notice everything. I said, ' Because my commitment to Rebecca wasn't until death do you part. It's for eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, I hadn't even thought of that before that, you know, but it's just it's true. Well, um what are we doing today? Well, we're traveling like places like this to be an encouragement to people. People have the entire message. I guarantee you Ron Peterson's got four different versions. &gt;&gt; A lot of people have, you know, all kinds of message books. And that's good. We can go see what he said. But we need to be encouraged to get into the book to listen closely, &gt;&gt; you know. So that's part of my job. &gt;&gt; Listen, get ready because this thing's about over, you know. And um so we're we're printing books in China. We printed thousands of of Church's books and seal books in China at a very good price delivered and so forth. But finally one of the Chinese people got to reading what it says and there's I don't know where it's at but some negative comment about communism. Forget this. So now we're printing in India and um so we're printing in Ecuador, Mexico, different places because people want a book they can underline. They want to they want to turn the pages, you know, and so we're very busy also with with humanitarian aid. If you know anything about the news, the US is going to march into Venezuela maybe today or tomorrow. They're going to try to cut off the drug trade. But guess what? There's too many of your friends and relatives that are buying the drugs. They'll give anything for those drugs. &gt;&gt; So, it's never going to stop. But things are going to come to a head real quick. And we'll see what happens then. But there's a lot of people in Venezuela are trying to help with $100 here, $100 there, just so they can buy some groceries just to make it, you know. Well, um, one last thing. I got a friend that God deals with him in dreams. And God deals in dreams. He gives some people dreams. He doesn't give me any dreams. And so he was this dream. He was in brother Rand's living room in Jeffersonville. And um Rebecca and I were sitting over by the fireplace and here's brother Neville and Sister Brandhammer sitting in the chairs talking and he's looking at it like a fly on the wall, you know. And so um directly brother Neville gets up to leave. He goes towards the door. Well the Lord took him in March of 1974. And so then Sister Brandon gets up to leave to see him out. And the Lord took her in May of 1981. And so then they're over here in this other dimension. And they said to Rebecca, here come over here with us. So she comes over there with them. That was November of ' 06. And um so they look back at me, all three of them, you keep doing what you're doing. &gt;&gt; So that's why I'm here today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God bless you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't need to leave that here. You guys are okay. &gt;&gt; Are we okay? Was it we check out now? Now, we have a time of questions and answers. So, you know, I wanted Brother George to get up. He's he's part of the he was married into the family, but he's he saw he's been in the meetings and he gave you a firsthand viewpoint of what it was like. And you know, a lot of times you think, well, you know, if you were around him and the first time he met Brother Brandon, Brother Brandon's got his shirt off. He's working in the backyard and everything. And uh you know, uh what I've always enjoyed about Brother George is I use the word he's down home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's no pretense. He's no flashing the the billboard or anything like that. He's just down home. And I've always appreciated that. and I've always found him. He and I have had some very very personal um discussions and times together. And I said, "Brother George," I said, "of all of the family that I am personal witness to," I says, "I appreciate your balance." And we've had that connection ever since. And uh uh so, Brother George has been around. He's been to many places. He's been in the meetings of brother Brennham and there are very few of them that are actually left. And um so uh I wanted him today and I had three witnesses in this church say, "Brother Ron, would you just have him just give his testimony, a little bit of the background? Let us fill in. Oh, we know he married Rebecca and everything. How did it come to pass? How what was it like uh when you met Brother Brennham and and different things and and so was that a blessing to you today to just hear firsthand? Yeah. Give me my hand. And uh so uh we're just staying here, keeping on trying to keep our balance &gt;&gt; in the midst of all of the ones that go on this side and want to go. God, keep us in the middle &gt;&gt; of the road. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless all of you. Let's stand together this morning. Amen. I want to say thank you to all of our friends and visitors that have come here to be with us today. God richly bless you. Um and uh I covet your prayers for me tomorrow, Lord willing, by let's say 8:30 I should be in recovery and out and everything. What I will probably do is Sandy will text it to the board and then the board will give it to somebody to Sister Linda or somebody and get let you guys know uh that brother Ron's okay and everything. And somebody asked me yesterday, are you are are you uh you know real nervous? And no, no. Hey, I you know I'm anxious. I want to get it done. So that's the only thing. Hey uh you know we get older and parts wear out. Some of you have got new shoulders and hips and and knees and eyes and teeth and different things. Uh, you know, it just happens. You get older. The Bible says that if this body be dissolved, we have another one. I'm thankful that I have another one. Okay, this one is wearing out, but I believe soon and very soon that I'm going to get that heavenly body &gt;&gt; and be in that other dimension. How will it happen? I don't know. One thing about that seventh seal, he didn't say uh of how it would happen and when it would happen. He said just make sure that you're a part of the happening. And I believe saints of God and just to let you know as brother George was talking about that prophetic insight. The more that I look into this message and the more that I am a personal witness of it, the more I am absolutely convinced it is supernatural. &gt;&gt; And he said, if you'll just get the people to believe, &gt;&gt; how many of you say I believe? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing Only Believe once again as we're going to dismiss. And I I'm going to have Brother George, he many of you maybe have not met him before and shook his hand. Um, and Brother Robert, if you would, if you take and get Brother George uh situated and if he needs to leave his stuff in my office, that's fine. But be able to shake your hand and say hello to you. Amen. Yes. only be only all things are possible. Only believe and only believe. Only believe for all things are possible. Only &gt;&gt; now we make it personal. Lord I believe and Lord I believe. Lord, I believe. All things are possible. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. And Lord, I believe. All things are possible Lord I. Amen. God bless you. Thank you. Turn around. Greet somebody. Say God bless you. Consider yourselves dismissed. You may go in the name of the Lord. Oh baby. Oh, holy. Yes. Holy. All things are all What do you I feel you. Heat. Heat.
