look brother Brenham always say answers that very simply he said look he said you might have gone quite a ways you might have strayed but he said if you've gone too far you would have no desire you wouldn't he said you could watch your mother's Soul fry in hell and laugh at it right and he says so you know if the devil ever tells you you've gone too far well number one he's a liar okay and so he there truth in him so uh you know we just talked just trying to get him out of this and I said the Bible says confess our faults he is more than Faith just to forgive us that's his word you got to take God at believe that the blood go forward is the enemy I said where's the greatest ever fought right here in the mind so we have to know spiritual warfare and uh so uh just remember just uh call

Lord father we realize that if you weren't in the house the house would be just full of vanities and lies and deceit and evilness Lord but when you're in the house Lord you you clean the house out and so that's why we've this evening Lord and I'm asking you would come to our house as individuals Lord the front door father the doors within our homes ask that by the ministering word and by your Holy Spirit would come and clean out houses Lord if there that shouldn't be there pray may it in the name of Jesus Christ for how can good and evil how can bitter and Sweet Waters come out of the same Fountain I ask this even evening Lord that you would bless your people in a mighty way we welcome you Lord we wash your feet we kiss your neck we say come and way in our lives we love you thank you we ask these now in the Name of Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord God bless you all this evening certainly good to be gathered in the name of the Lord God bless musicians thank you and uh I see a little back here and um it's got my name written on it look right here brother Robert said it would be right there and I believed him and there it is and so brother Justin here if you could set it out there that way I'm not distracted by that thing and uh I remember one time uh uh when I was a kid my grandma lived right across the street from us probably I don't know 60 yards across the street directly there and uh it was around around Christmas time and I thought to myself man I'm going to find my presents I can't wait and so where my grandma's living room where she would sit she could see right stairs there so I was climbing up the attic and I was trying to my presents and everything and Line This is back when there was land and um yep old and um and sure enough it was my mom and did you find what you're looking for I said how did Mom she said we can see you through the and uh anyways if that thing was right here I would be really distracted by wondering what's in it so God bless you richly we certainly appreciate that uh if you have your Bibles turn with me to the book of Psalm and chapter 28 Psalms chap 28 we'll read verses 1 through3 and it says unto thee will I Cry Oh Lord my rock be not silent to me lest if thou be silent to me I become like them that go down into the pit hear the voice of my when I cry onto thee when I lift up my hand Lord thy holy draw me not away the wicked and with the work of iniquity with speak peace neighbors but Mischief is in their hearts you may be seated this evening verse one says uh onto the will I cry the Lord my rock be not silent unto me I would like to uh take for a simple thought this evening when God is silent when God is silent and so we know that God is not just some uh figment of our imagination but we realize that God is real and that God is a a real being with a real intelligence and this intelligence that we call uh God we understand he is the creator of the heavens and of the earth we understand that his intelligence far greater than the int that we have as mortal that's right his intelligence is the intelligence the Supreme in intelligence it is the int that is above uh anything that we could even uh imagine as as being smart or being intelligent God is so much more above that his intelligence is actually so great that a man will look at it and will think it's foolish right it is so intelligent that it confounds the wise and that's what it is designed to do that that that the wise and The Prudent would look to it and they would try to understand it and he's so intelligent that he can reveal himself in Simplicity to where the wayfaring man can understand it but when man his intelligence and uh and his education science when he looks at tries to understand God says I cannot understand this is foolishness but to the Bride of Jesus Christ God is Not foolishness his intelligence is not foolishness his word is foolishness but it is the of God which Chang lives to Salvation that's right so we see that uh we cannot understand god with our human eyes when we realize when we when we look into the galaxies and we look at the Sun and we look at the Moon and we look at nature and we look at stars and galaxies and all these things I don't understand how people can look at these things can look at nature they can see how everything run continuity one with another but yet not believe in an intelligent who created all these things everything runs perly and in order for something great not to be it Hallelujah so we see that this world that we're living in today is is in complete chaos and the reason that the world is in chaos is because of the intelligence of man it's not because of God it's not because necessarily uh I was going to say of Satan but it is but it's man's own intelligence and his own will wisdom that has this world in turmoil and brother brandom said he said that God that is going to destroy himself man is going to destroy this Earth he's going to destroy this Society because of his own wisdom and his own intelligence father don't let me go this this the wavered way own smarts or my own intelligence or my own wisdom let walk in the wisdom of God because if I'm left to myself I walk in my own wisdom it's going to lead me astray but if I walk in the wisdom of God under the intelligence of his word it'll keep me in that straight and narrow path the problem is we get distracted because of our own wisdom we try to figure things out I went too far but about this how can God me it's not up to me try and figure it out of God does those things he written it in his word there believe it you say brother stepen simple that's faith faith is so simp yet it is a profound thing birth pains 1965 brother Bram says people's science has broke into God's Great laboratory until they're destroying they're going to destroy themselves God lets always lets wisdom destroy himself don't let me on to my own wisdom Lord God doesn't destroy anything man destroys himself by wisdom as he did at the beginning taking Satan's wisdom of God's word now knows she must give way she cannot stand what's he talking about he talking about Mother Earth she can't give way anyer she can't stand any longer she has to give there has to be something happens to this that we dwell in Mother Earth today is in a place of total Decay and rottenness she has been robbed of her resources taken advantage of and brother brandham says this he said that she is she is so flustered red in the FL NE red in the face and nervous with tidal waves earthquakes floods and so forth are rotten condition he says her politics are her church anity rotten denomination rotten people's lives are and it's causing aess upon this earth live in and brother Brenham says calls her mother earth as a he's red in the face she's embarrassed of what's in place around her she can't believe the things that are taking place of of society and politics and all the these different evils in the world today and she's ashamed she's red in the face therefore she's giving out these tidal waves she's she's flooding the Earth there's there's one year there's a lot of fires the next year there's a lot of floods one year there's a lot of earthquakes and and we see that she she's rocking and she's weighing in the balance what's happening she has to rot before she can give because she a birthing position but before a can bring forth life first it has to run whenever we see a little seed a little apple seed or what is that hard shell that it surrounds it is not life of the seed life of the seed dwell within that little hardship so that's why when the seed is planted in the ground it's got to rot and if it doesn't rot it'll never bring forth the life that dwells within that shell and that's where planet Earth is at today she's rotten to the very core but Hallelujah that's a good thing for us because it's just a sign that when she rots because of this filth that's taken place around her and in her we know that she's going to birth another new heavens and a new Earth that's what we need to keep our eyes upon is that new Earth is that New Jerusalem not to get caught with politics and the EV of this world though it is evil we want to look to the we want to look to our Pro we want to look to what's of us not what's behind us what's going on right now thank we see that it's rotten why because she's going birth God created all these things things he didn't just keep it in his mind and think about it until it happened but God first thought it within his mind and after he thinks it in his mind then he begins to speak with his voice our title the see is that go this silent God but I want to spend time to show you first that God is not always silent God has a voice actually likes to speak God actually likes to tell and God likes to reveal things to his bride he doesn't just keep them to himself but he pulls his bride clo and he says here's my secrets here is the mystery of the book that was once hidden now it is being made manifest it's this book which was once sealed with Seven Seals is now opened it has now been revealed and here you go I'm going to give you these Mysteries so God is not always silent we see there's two reasons why God is silent and we'll get into that in a moment but God has a voice and he likes to speak you know you have a voice also and God wants you to speak also he doesn't just want you to keep things within your mind but he wants you to speak in your mind all the sisters said a the brothers were [Music] like that's not how men operate my daughter told me day and uh what was it it was something like um you know dads can answer any profound question words mm you know you know we know all things mm that's right it's you know the secret to to marriage is this is that as long as you catch a few a few sentences a few words of the sentence you're okay as long as you can continue it you'll do real good yes H right and my wife will say it was a, dress yeah go ahead you're listening to what I'm saying are you no I wasn't so it only works sometimes Psalm 33 verses 6-9 by the word Lord where the heavens and all the host of them bre of his mouth he GA Waters of the sea together he he layeth up the depth in in storehouses let all the Earth fear the lord let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him for he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood fast so we realize that all things that were created they were created by the very voice of God whether it was the heavens and the stars and the moon and whether it's the Earth and everything dwells there in everything see everything that unseen we understand everything was created by voice of God that's right why God has a voice God likes to speak this when God speaks things when gods and says something situations get better when God speaks uh lives are changed people are healed people are delivered circumstances around us change why because because of the voice of God lord so God has a voice he spoke to Abraham in the Book of Genesis concerning a promise that he would be the father of many nations he spoke to Moses through a burning bush and on Mount siani he spoke to Elijah he spoke to Micaiah he spoke to all the different prophets lip the ear as it were why because God has a voice and God likes to speak amen God spoke to the prophets from lip to ear and theet then would re to the people what told them and become the voice of God to the with thus sayth the Lord amen so it was no longer the people are the prophets that were speaking but when they would speak through inspir ation we understand when they speak and say thus sayith the Lord that it was no longer the person speaking that's right but it's the Lord speaking praise God you know uh it just comes to my my mind there and I'll share this where we started with the senior youth on why we believe what we believe and and using scriptures to you know because the Bible is our abs want to use the scripture to up our thoughts on why we believe believe and here last week last Sunday our our our uh meeting was about why we believe in a prophet and why we believe that brother Brandon was that prophet and so so we went through it anyways and and and and I was sharing and admonishing the youth and just saying listen don't be scared about what you believe and don't be scared to share what you believe with other people because you never know what'll happen you know maybe someone might get converted and believe what you believe too and I realized that in doing this a lot easier said than done so go Monday at work uh um paint and everything and um UPS on these door jams and I probably painted these door four times and people just come through and they could car and ding it up and up and all sorts and you know the painter will get it that's that's the that's the the saying right the painter will get it and he'll clean it up and so anyway there was I had walked in and and there was this guy and I had some music playing on my phone some Christian music or whatever and he goes boy you're a Christian I said yes sir I am and um this guy's from California I seen his license plate so I already bit about him and I'm all here's a c kid and uh God can save California is that right brother Ron and so anyways here got this long hair and T nice guy man real nice guy so he's like oh praise the Lord to him we begin to talk conversations over and I go back bathroom and I'm trying to touch up guy comes along and uh and he's a Mexican guy a little bit older and um you know how some of these older Mexican guys can be they're real serious man real serious you know they got that that that attitude so this guy he he he said something to me and I said you're not a drywall guy are you cuz drywall guys had come through three or four times and I have to redo the work and and so he's all no I'm not no drywall guy I said oh Gloria adios and he looks at me he goes glor adios Gloria not a Christian I'm a so this is where the conversation was it wasn't with the kid it was with this guy and so so so he's talking to me or whatever ask me a question he goes who is to you kind of question I said okay to me Jesus was manifestation of God and flesh pretty simple well he misunderstood what I said and he thought I was trinitarian so he starts giving me like Jesus only Doctrine and he begins to share with me and he says you know are you a father well yes sir I am and you're a son and I'm thinking yeah I am and he said you're a spirit I said that's right yes sir he goes but what's your name I said Hallelujah yeah it's Stephen and he goes well that's a same with the Lord Jesus Christ and all of a sudden my ringers are going off like I've heard this stuff before huh and so anyways uh he says I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I said praise the Lord so have I I said said have you re Holy Ghost so guy is pretty aggressive to me they're it's an older Mexican they are the Mexican people here man huh brother Paul that's how these old are man and um and so anyways uh so he's kind of come a little bit and he's he's he's um a grand to say the least and let him go with it yeah that's true I believe the same thing I don't believe in the trinity so we go back and forth so I thought well here we go I'm going to ask this guy and uh I and I'll be honest with you I was telling the youth don't be scared to say what you believe man I felt sick cuz I knew what I was going to do I'm like Hey cuz he's in the bathroom I was in the hallway at this stage I said hey you know Malachi 4 he opens the door huh I said you know Malachi 4 verse 5 and six behold I send you Elijah the prophet he says yeah that I I know that script I said really yeah I know that and so I said well who is what's his name he goes you tell me Lord said is William brandham no it's not it's not William brandham he goes starts telling me about these other churches and about how they have prophets and they'll send false prophets and he now he's kind of mad at me because now he knows what I believe okay and and he's saying uh well this one has a prophet and this one over here and he's really fighting me back I said wait a second what's your problem if you know about Malachi and6 and I'm guessing believe it where did it go wrong where did you get offended and why did you leave what happened happened why do you have so much against it and I discern it was very easy to discern and he goes well I dated a girl that went this to church a long time ago he goes let me ask you a question and it good I was always fighting with her brothers and this and that saints of God fighting with somebody doesn't really get you anywhere that's right but I wasn't in fighting stage yet that comes in a second so yeah so he told he says to me let me ask you a question I don't want to take up too much time but he says let me ask you a question will there be animals in heaven I'm thinking this guy knows the message I says yeah there will be he says tell me why I said because he said so oh so you believe because he said there's going to be his horse and his dog there that it's going to be there I said yes sir I do so then he got a smart alley well is Paul going to have a is going to be full of farms up there in heaven sir I don't know so anyways uh we're talking back and forth a little bit let me tell you something deceived then I drew my sword I'm deceived I don't think so I draw my sword I'm doing my doing my touch-ups on my knees I stand up now we're right there two of us together I I said let me ask you a question you've been asking me all these questions let me ask you a question what is the Vindication of a prophet in the Old Testament he says what do you mean I said well let me tell you the answer to the question if he says thus sayith the Lord and it comes to pass the Bible says to hear that man I said now you know the message and I Know It 193 I said brother brandham said they'll give the right to vote it'll be the wrong vote they'll vote man 19 women weren't allowed to vote they weren't allowed out of the kit it's just how it was it's were treated I said yet he goes from sin to sin that there will be a woman in power in the United States 19 and33 even allowed to vote now look at the woman in America tell me was the prophecy right or was it wrong I said he prophesied 19 and33 about how cars would be egg-shaped and they'd be driverless cars tell me was he right or wrong and I just started going through all the visions of brother brandom I said let me ask you this every time that somebody stood before him was he when he discerned their hearts is ah no com Amigo I can't have this discussion I don't so much and off he went I said let me tell you here one second I said why you don't believe this message he goes no tell me I said for for you to believe you know what you're right and I thought and he just off I thought by the confession of his own mouth don't be scared about this message don't be scared because the Bible backs it up his life backs it up the Vindication backs it up Hallelujah we got nothing to be scared about when we share it I don't care who it is or how much of the scripture he knows it's the truth yeah so anyways I was having to practice a little preach to the youth realized it was tough but it's worth it man it's worth it you get your feathers r a little bit and you have a of back and forth it's for you it's good to get those those those feathers you know those feathers they're all feathers you ever see where a been roosting or a bird has been sitting on a tree and there's a bunch of feathers all over the place they're dead feathers we don't need dead feathers on our body we got to shake them off once in a while that's what it did it was good I enjoyed it it was fun so we realized that Daniel Elijah Moses and all these prophets that we see throughout the scripture all the way to Jesus Christ himself we realize that they were the voice of God with thus saith the Lord my commission 1951 brother brandham said just like the pole in the water of Bethesda it couldn't say look what a great water I am for when the angel went off of the water it was just water is that that's right now I'm your by the grace of God but when of the Lord moves down it then a voice of God to you now not is a voice of God that um to maybe if I offended you by saying forgive me but I felt that might been resented I am God's voice to you so he went from saying a voice to you to saying I am God's voice to you see I I say that again that time was under inspiration you see and I felt bad about it the first time but I repeated it I can say nothing in myself but what he shows me I say it you believe it and watch that happen see what is it it's no longer just a voice but it's the voice of God to you personally as an individual he says now I say that under inspiration he didn't want to say it to offend people but when the man gets uh insired by God and the spirit you just got to uh uh lay the axe to the tree man and let the chip where they will but he am God's voice this is kind of a continuation on of Sunday but the voice of that started creation the same voice that continued down through the prophets understand it is not a different voice but it's the same voice in creation that spoke Let There Be is the same voice that spoke through the prophets and said thus sayeth the Lord It's not a different voice neither a different being but it is God now it's not just all to himself it but he's using as an instrument now to say what he to get said to the people brother brandham said this God could have used the sun used the trees he could have nature to preach his gospel yet he still does but instrumentation is man and he has never changed his ways thank you Lord it is not woman for the Bible says that a woman must remain silent within the church it does not mean that a woman cannot say Amen in the church and all the sisters said am praise the Lord but it means that she must not assert authority over the man the Bible says that Adam was created then and Adam was not dece but the woman was the one was deceived why you can see like a lot of uh uh denominations that have women pastors let anything go within the assembly well love and God loves you and come as you are and it's all love and love and love then they have homosexual pastors both women and men what a mockery of God that kind of stuff should not be be behind the pulpit uh before God's people amen amen it's true so we realize that this that that what God started in creation through the prophet same voice down to Jesus down through the new test down through the discip right up until brother Brandon we write up until time that we are now living uh it it is a different voice but it is a continuation of the same voice started back here because I am Alpha and I am I am the a I am the Z I'm the beginning I'm the ending my voice which was here voice in the end time same voice it is the god just within a different manifestation through peoples we know the bride of Christ now is final sounding the voice of God to the Gentile dispensation It's the final sounding of the same voice that was back here amen it is not a different voice that's right but it's the same voice now she's sounding her gospel trumpet and what is this bride saying she's saying the exact same thing that this seventh angel messenger said yes sir because the bride and the spirit say they're saying the thing that's right Hallelujah she does not one word nor take away from it but she stand on the solid rock of thus sayith fulfilling her commission understand those of you who claim to be the Bride of Jesus Christ God has commissioned you not to stay quiet not to keep it within your mind or within your heart but to take that little book to eat the little book and to prophesy that thing that you have taken part of that is your commission in this day that is your responsibility in this day it's not just the pastor it's not just the preacher it's not just the deacons but those who are with this mystical body Jesus Christ the Christ are commissioned to take the word and to prophesy to share how you're got live Amen to share what God has life to share in the time piece of great scriptures you're commissioned of God Amen and you're saying surely not me surely you well I'm scared so am I I don't know what to say neither do I sometimes but when you're commissioned to do something sir yes sir I I can want me to speak to that person Lord help me you there's a proverb that uh God those who help themselves that's a lie God helps those who can't I think that's why I make a pretty good Christian because I can't help myself I need God to lead me I need God to help me I need God to pick me up when I fall I need God in my life and I can't do it without him amen me too so you've been commissioned by God to become one with the book by eating it and letting your life then be the manifestation of that prophecy if you if it's not your your your time or your if it's not for you to preach a sermon brother brandham says what live your sermon so now we see that speaks in many different ways he through nature he speaks through reading his word he us through uh the Min of the word he speaks to us through dreams and visions and preaching and and and and other people to encourage and to help us along Journey God doing when he's doing that speaking to you but so much of the time we get so carnal so much of the time our hearts get so hardened that when the voice of God speaks we miss it I say father keep my spirit soft keep my heart tender keep it pure that when you speak to me whether it's through the minister through reading your word whe whether it's through a a a compassionate friend or whatever it may be father when you take the time to speak to me let my ears and be be be open to hear and my heart soft to receive Lord God does those he also speaks to us with an Voice direct the ear just like he Samuel you see we can't God in this little box that he can only speak on Wednesday nights and he can to you on Sundays and it and and be a certain way be under uh expectation you got to be under anticipation to say wow I wonder how God is going to speak to me today yes I wonder is he I wonder how he's going to do it and when you begin to wander these things and you're under expectation for it you'll begin to realize what speaks there's no greater feeling God comes by and speaks to us as individuals there's not greater than when he comes by and he body and he answers prayer and feel his presence and God and it's just wonderful fantastic and We Know It And encourages us and we know what good what happens when God is silent what happens when we're praying and there's no answer back what happens when when we're under anticipation and there's silence what happens when they're silent when we're listening for the voice of God how do we react to it and what does it do to us hallelujah why would God be purposely silent when we know that he hears and answers our why it why look like God is just ignoring us he's not back we're not anything out of the services we hear anything we haven't had we no one's encouraged us we there's just silence why God be Sil why wouldn't he speak if he loves us so much have he cared so much for us why doesn't he answer why is is it that there's times in our lives and I know you can all attest to this that it seems like the voice of God is silent it seems like he's taken a step back it seems like his presence has left us it's just quietness there's nothing there it it it seems like there's there's there God doesn't care because if he really cared he would answer 1960 Elijah in the meal offering brother brandom says you know God has a way of answering prayer this little woman had lived true talking about uh uh the the the little woman there that had the Barrel in the meal and it was they were all out of water she had not married again she was stay to meet her husband in glory was an honorable woman for weeks the barrel had been going down down and her continually praying it still looked like there was no hope in nowhere you know could there we could get a lesson from that that if you have prayed andm all the requirements that God requires you to meet and he's still silent he doesn't say anything and yet you've met the requirements now what happens then so we see as as we go through this that there's going to be two reasons why God stays silent whenever we are in uh trying to have fellowship with him and we're praying and we're asking and we're seeking there's two reasons why but brother brandom says first of all there that that and this really had had struck out to me here and he says that uh yet you've met the requirements thing that God is is is doing is that there's these certain requirements for us that we must follow in order to hear from now when we first come to Christ and we give our heart to the Lord we realize that that that as a sinner that God does hear the prayer of a sincere heart who is sincerely repenting of their ways but a person that is professing to be a Christian and now they have not met the requirement of completely coming under the blood and they have unconfessed sin in their life we realize that this that God wants us to um repent of our sins it's not just a one-time deal well I asked God way back here and I asked him to forgive me of my praise the Lord I don't have to again no it's natural for us in the body to be Sinners did you know that unfortunate actually because here we are when come to Christ we're trying to live a CH and we're trying to do good trying to do the best that and yet within our still there's still this brother it a sticky nature and we realize on a daily basis that we have a fight with this sticky nature and when we feed this sticky nature it is the nature that's going to consume our body and not only will it consume our bodies it'll consume Our Lives it'll consume your mind it'll consume your think thinking it'll consume your heart which therefore will consume what you do in this life and so if we are feeding this sticky nature it is almost impossible for us to live an overcoming life I know I shouldn't but stop someone say that I know I shouldn't because of iniquity knowing what's right and not it the love of many wax amen why because of iniquity I know we need to go past I know within our minds to yes Lord within our hearts amen and meet the requirements of God in our lives because the Bible says this the Bible says If thy heart condemns thee not ask what thou wilt and it'll be given onto you but when your own heart is condemning you because you're feeding the wrong nature you can never have the grounds of Faith to stand upon the solid rock of faith and say father I really need this when your heart condemns you you can't have faith to ask that's right but when your heart condemns you not hallelujah oh it's a complete different story show us and it will satisfy us how you in the prayer line that's standing in the line if there's any confess sin in your life I'm laying it right back in my brother look if you have got sin that you have confessed just be aware that you'll be worse than ever come here to be prayed for confess sin in your life you see so instead of coming through the prayer line and wanting to get better and wanting to get healed and wanting to get delivered if there's unconfessed sin in their life that person's life will actually get worse the sickness will get worse whatever it is that's troubling that person will actually get worse in their lives so that's why the Bible says this lay hands suddenly on no man they might have a desire to be healed they might have a desire to be set free and all these things but if they're holding on to sin in their lives that prayer is actually going to make it worse amen and it actually has a effect on their lives that never went through the prayer line good advice it is for us that if we ever need we ever come up to the front we want to be Anointed with oil laid upon us and those things that if we come up here with sin that our life might actually worse instead better that's why it's good for you if someone ask you would you pray for me brother would you pray for me sister I'm in desperate need I'm in desperate help well what is the need what is the help why are you having such a hard time what's going on it's not that you're being nosy but you're trying to discern and find out what is it in this person's life if there's anything that's causing this and if it's something that's causing it and it's unconfessed sin I don't want to pray to cast that thing off because I'll be working against the works of God in that person's life it's very very isn't it he said confess just be aware that you'll you ever come here to for with unconfessed life you may things right if that's in your life out of line just a minute make right come back in line why does he say to come back line because if you've made things right if you've if you've confessed your faults before God and you've been overshadowed and cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ even the gift in brother brandom's life couldn't bring it up because it's not there anyways amen because our sins have been washed in the bleach blood of Jesus Christ thank you but if it's unconfessed it's there for the prophet to see it now that's the reason my lines used to be when I when I combed each person closely to see if there was sin in their life by the visions of the Lord then the reason I did that was to be sure if God permitted Satan to put uh something on the people and I come prayer and take it off I would be in trouble with God I don't want to do that that's the reason I kept it one by one and watch closely pass by now tonight Discerning line not inment but just pray you've got unconfessed sin in your life come the line before you make it right now then if you have when you pass by here by just say I'm going up and let brother Brandon pray for me get that way off your mind the thing to do is know that you're coming to fulfill a promise that God Made You amen very important that God Made You The Promise personally by his word not just for brother Brandon to pray or the minister to pray but God Made You the promise and when you come by faith knowing that God made you a promise he gave you something which is called Faith to say hey if I go up there I know I'll be delivered amen so it's all about you personally taking the word Promises of God person personally to yourself and when you come by and pray lay hands on you just hands laid upon you like uh rise up out of the water of being baptized have done something that God give what would happen believes in his baptized shall be saved you go right out of this building testify saved what if you got out of the saying that well I don't know then you're not saved but God will make your body obey your confession and he is the high priest of our confession see and uh he's the high priest of our confession before you can be healed you have to confess it first somebody say first first not wait until you see the change but confess it first say God has already healed my body God has already saved me the work is already finished therefore I'm going to come under the umbrella of those promises and I'm going to say father thank you thank you for what you've done in thank you for touching me thank you for bringing my son thank you for bringing the prodal thank you for what you've done watch God now your and everything else to the level of your conf don't let your confession be negative let your confession be POS don't let your conf be low but let your be high in the word of God that's right because whatever you confess that's what's going to happen shared with the youth on Sunday the other week you know if you hang around with negative people you become negative you know if you hang around a certain h a certain person that's a certain way you're going to become that way in your own life also you hang around someone that never has any money you're never going to have any money you're always going to be giving them your money amen negativity breeds negativity unbelief breeds unbelief but positivity bre positivity Faith breeds faith in your life low in faith tomorrow morning up somebody that you know and energized and and get to talking to them for sure enough when you hang up you're going to say wow I feel I feel good I feel I feel like my faith is why because faith energizes faith so he says here continuing on with this quote and then when you believe you're healed God makes your body obey your confession so now when you come here by here just let it be settled say God this is your command I believe I'm Healed and walk off the platform Allelujah unconfessed sin I won't dwell upon this for very long but so much of the time we think of unconfessed sin as drinking and smoking and and and and and adultery and all different things and we think of that as the the great sin we just share this that a spin of a sin of end there's a sin of jealousy there's there's a sin of having hate against somebody for no reason and all these things and what is the smoking and the cigarettes things you know what it is it's all outward and everybody can see easy to see and when you really get converted and it it just falls off of you but still within this sticky nature there's things that we deal with that we must confess we must confess of our high temper we must confess of these different things of saying things and thinking things that we oughtn't to be thinking Hallelujah it goes beyond out here to down into the holiest of holies in our lives down into our heart a lot of times it's not this is just the outward expression of what's really going on here there's something wrong heart some the line that needs and I surgeon but is a heart surgeon and if you would just open to the Holy Spirit and say father I have my heart that only you care of the preacher can't take care of it no one else can take care of it only you can take care of it I'm upon the operating table tonight Lord come and have your way and operate on this Stony heart father God and believe with all your heart and watch God take care of it so the first thing that will cause uh God to be silent in our lives is unconfessed the second thing that God does that God is silent in our lives and we all know this very well and that he wants to test us to see the kind of real that we're going to have El like this same paragraph 42 they're they're uh I'll read it again I did this twice that's okay if you prayed amid all the god requires you to meet and still he's silent doesn't say anything and yet you've met the requirements now what happens then in other words uh requirement of God is is is is getting converted and giving your heart to Christ and being baptized and having the Holy Ghost and you've met the requirements you've confessed your sin to God there's really nothing your heart doesn't condemn you therefore now you should have an audience with God and if he's still silent what then if you know that you have met his requirements and done all that you know to do then Faith doesn't waver it just sits still and thinks postive faith it's Everlasting grip around of Ages doesn't move great fellow called faith of said Faith got hair when he speaks everything else when faith says then everything else stops the boss and she met every requirement she had lived clean she had lived decent she lived honorable and she had met all of God's requirements but looked like he was silent God does that some time to test you to see what kind of a reaction you'll have and then he says don't forget it don't forget it that if you've met all of God's requirements and you're standing before God and you're you're you're praying to God for a touch in your body or whatever it may be brother brandham said Faith doesn't move faith stay Faith quiet and RS upon that rock of agent Rock of uh of of of salvation of Revelation that we have that Stripes guess what already healed by the blood of Jesus Christ live a Sanctified life because that's what the blood does and by faith in God we can believe for our Salvation amen Amen brother Bram says the blood does not save you sanctifies you from your sin it's faith in the finished work what saves you direct quote go look it up but he says she met all the requirements God does that so to test you to see what reaction you'll have don't foret it I I wonder why would he say don't for so easy for us to forget it's so easy for us as we're going through life have the ups and downs of life we have troubles and we have trials tribulations and temptations whatever it is that comes out of life and and and and and and issues and health issues and money issues and family issues and and there's just life is complicated and it's just so many issues it's easy to forget why we're going through the test and it's easy to take on instead of taking the mind of Christ it's easy to take the mind of Satan yeah and we begin to think he doesn't love me this ain't they don't care God don't God is silent he spoke to me I've been and I've been praying I've been confessing my sin and trying to do what's right and and God's requirements but yet but one issue after another it's after another and it just feels going round a roundabout get off this roundabout to get on the straight and narrow way you don't care what's the point it's easy to forget the why within the trial it's easy to forget the why within the when we are surrounded by the tests and the of lusia Hallelujah I'm just glad that I don't get my identity Satan amen I don't get my identity I am and where I came from and where I and who I am right now is the son of because of some thought that Satan tries to give me because of my carnal mind that's nothing but enmity with God the wisdom of man but the wisdom of God say walk faith not by what you think by what you think you not by yours but you walk by faith that's simple that's why I like cuz I'm simple person I'm what's known as a simpleton I don't know what that is is that even a word it's it's just like uh worser you know some kind of word is worser Stephen I'm a worser [Laughter] simpleton Hallelujah the same sermon 1960 let me let me let me just share this brother says don't forget it so it's not because you're not a God or that God love love you but it's actually quite the opposite because every son and every child son and daughter of God that to God must first be Ted tried and proven so if you're through the test and you're going another test and you're going through test guess what it's a pretty good sign that you are a child of God don't forget it God tests us to see if if we really mean from our heart what your lips are saying he's going to test it you say you believe in God you're going to be tested you believe that God can bring the home you're going to be tested you believe in healing you're tested if you say that God meets all of your you're going to be tested all of your needs I have found God has has never left with not enough sometimes the bank account can look good and other times it can look pretty embarrassing other times the vehicle can be going good and other times not so good but I have realized that through life and the things that we go through that I know how it is to be a based I know how it is to be exalted yes whatever I find myself in I am going to tent because I know that all things are working together for the good my life Hallelujah this same Ser paragraph 60 he demanded of of testimony of your healing you you might not know it but just hang on when you are sure that you've met all the requirements when you know that you've done everything that you know to do and laid yourself before God there's only one thing to do is hang on to his promise then stay there God promised to answer he'll do it that's right it's not something have to drum up it's not that we have to work up amount of faith in our Liv believe for something but believe it and stay right there hang on to it he'll do it why because he has promised that he's going do it so we're not depending upon our own promises because we can make promises and we can break promises but with God when he says when he gives a promise within his word it is yay and it is amen it will never fail that's right thank you Lord as the musicians come please so many times we like to say oh how I would love to just be in the time of Jesus when Jesus walked the shore Galilee when Jus give the blind back side when Jesus did Jesus Jesus spoke voice and this person was set and this person who was was found in their right mind and oh I would just love to be presence of Jes Jesus Christ how I would have loved to have been the times of the disciples that when people walk past their very shadow that Faith arose in their lives and they were healed all because of the shadow of a person oh Lord how great it would have been to have been in those days but I want to remind you that that same go that was back then that same go that was in that same God that was in disciples is the same God that is here tonight the same God that is in you he is the same God that is in your he is the same God that within me and there he does the same word praise the Lord every promise in the book is mine amen every chapter every verse every line I'm trusting in his love divine every promise in the book is mine thank you Lord whether it be a promise of Salvation whether it be a promise of healing in our bodies the prodal returning whatever it may be overcoming something within your life the promise is still good the word good and brother tells us this just hang on to those promises don't [Music] move excited get nervous anxious don't worry how it's going to come to pass if you've met God's and your heart condemns you not put it in God's hands and walk by faith yes put it in the hands of God and move on and say father I'm going to remind you once this promise that you have given onto and I believe that it's to happen right when is it going to happen exactly time so why is it in your life this evening perhaps God is silent is he silent because that there's unconfessed sin in your life only you know the answer to that or is he silent because you're going through the testings and you're going through the trials to see what's really within your heart I want you to know this that God knows exactly what's in your heart amen he want to realize what heart [Music] Abraham took his son up there Isaac him and he tied him up and he got him all and here he was the sacrifice for an offering and he was ready to them and the voice speak to stay your hand Abraham for know that you love me wait a second I thought God knows all things but Abraham didn't know no doubt when Abraham stepped out of the commission that God had given him to slay his son he realized wow what was I to do Sarah be so mad at me Isaac you better not I'm sleeping on the couch tonight what was in his heart knew where Adam was in the garden but he wanted Adam to where he was God knew about Abraham God knows what's in our hearts but he wants you to know what's in your heart he wants you to see your reac to an action so you can exactly where you're at in spiritual [Music] walk so where are you at this evening head bowed every eye closed [Music] this evening in your walk with the Lord these are things in your life that perhaps you need the Holy Ghost to come and take care of it's got to be a willing saice just like Isaac just like Jesus himself he was willing did it all joy to go to the Cross what about you this in your life something you need to confess before God need to confess it before me or anybody else popes in this message no priests where we need to come and confess what you're trying to edit no but God you need to confess it to God and you need to make it right to God and then once you right to God still got ought in your heart against your brother brother the B this leave your The Altar and go right with your brother and then come to the Altar and bring your gift rejoice and worship let the holy speak to your hearts tonight father Lord there's always something in our lives that we're dealing with putting up with but Lord I pray that your word says this that it's the goodness of God that leads us to repentance Lord I ask that and every day of Our Lives that your goodness lead us to a place of repent Lord whatever it may in our lives as individuals we deal with different and we react in different ways but you are the God who saves heals and delivers and so I'm asking now Lord that even now and in the

word of God Amen I know he spoke to my heart tonight put me in remembrance of things huh don't forget huh God is just reminding you amen a lot of times we think prayer lines are the answer to all the situation no if it was unconfessed sin you get worse that's why prayer line after and it just seems like people Deliverance he sent word and it people sent his word more people have Spirits cast out speaking of the word and ministering of the goel and the laying on of hands and there's nothing the prayer line praise God lay on the sick they shall recover but most of the time what's happened is you're not preaching to the people hey don't try to come through this prayer line with you with unconfessed sin huh amen oh my you have met all of God's requirements and still silent [Music] we all go through this there'll be times huh you remember the brandom told God me an answer huh yeah you owe me answer go talking in his attitude towards God he says he let me he left me there standing he and he said he pulled back his presence from me for I think it was 6 months and he said I didn't hear nothing until finally he humbled his heart and he said father you don't owe me nothing I am sorry and I humble myself and then all a sudden God speaks to him they showed him about that girl that had drowned and oh my God keep our hearts cleansed oh Father the Bible says that the of Life choke out a
