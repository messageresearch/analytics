[5:14] behave.
[5:16] [Music]
[5:21] Let's all stand. Let's sing that. You
[5:23] deserve the
[5:25] glory. You deserve the
[5:29] glory and the
[5:34] honor. Lord, we lift our hands in
[5:39] worship as we lift your holy name. You
[5:45] deserve the
[5:46] [Music]
[5:48] glory and the
[5:51] [Music]
[5:53] honor. Lord, we lift our hands in
[5:58] worship as we lift your holy name. For
[6:03] you are
[6:05] great. You do miracles so
[6:09] great. There is no one else like you.
[6:17] There is no one else like you. For you
[6:22] are
[6:23] great. You do
[6:25] miracles so
[6:28] great. There is no one else like
[6:34] you. There is no one
[6:39] else like you.
[6:43] Amen. There is none like him tonight.
[6:45] It's good to be in his presence this
[6:47] evening. Before we go to the Lord in
[6:49] prayer, let's sing. I know the master of
[6:50] the wind. Amen. If you have a storm in
[6:52] your life tonight, he's more than able
[6:55] to take control and turn it all around.
[6:58] Amen. My boat of
[7:01] life sails on a troubled
[7:06] sea. Whenever there's a wind in my
[7:14] sand, but I have a
[7:18] friend who's watching over
[7:23] me when the priest turns
[7:26] into a
[7:31] king. I know the master of the
[7:40] way. I know the maker of the
[7:47] rain. He can calm the storm. He'll make
[7:52] the sun to shine
[7:56] again. I know the master of the wind.
[8:05] Sometime I
[8:07] soar like an eagle to the
[8:11] high. Among the peaks my soul can be
[8:19] found. An
[8:21] unexpected
[8:23] storm may drive me from
[8:27] behind, may bring me low, but it will
[8:30] never bring me
[8:33] [Music]
[8:36] down. I know the master of the
[8:44] way. I know the maker of the rain.
[8:52] He can calm the storm and make the sun
[8:57] to shine
[9:00] again. I know the master of the Sing the
[9:04] course
[9:08] again. I know the master of the way.
[9:14] [Music]
[9:17] I know the maker of the
[9:23] rain. He can calm the storm. Make the
[9:28] sun to shine
[9:31] again. I know he can calm the
[9:38] storm. Yes, he can calm the
[9:42] storm and make the sun to shine again.
[9:48] I know the
[9:50] master of the
[9:53] wind. Amen. So glad I know that master
[9:56] of the wind tonight. Amen. I don't have
[9:59] any written prayer requests, but we have
[10:00] two praise
[10:02] reports. One from brother Matt Matthew
[10:04] Fielding like to ask brother Matthew if
[10:05] you'd come and take us to the Lord in
[10:07] prayer. Brother Matt, he wants to thank
[10:09] the Lord for keeping him safe from a
[10:11] rattlesnake while he was working. He
[10:13] said, "I had my back to it. I was in a
[10:15] very vulnerable position, but God is
[10:17] good. So, thank the Lord for watching
[10:19] over brother
[10:20] Matt. Sister Fionas turned in a note
[10:23] tonight. She says, "I want to give God
[10:24] the glory for resolving an issue I had
[10:27] with my social security card after I
[10:30] started a new job. It could have been
[10:32] escalated so I would have to look for
[10:34] another job. I had to go to the court in
[10:36] several months to resolve as well as
[10:38] some
[10:39] cost. This was causing a lot of stress,
[10:42] but God worked everything perfectly.
[10:45] like only he can. Things got resolved
[10:47] right away without going to the courts,
[10:49] having to spend any money. God is so
[10:52] gracious and he's never too late. Amen.
[10:55] We serve an ontime God. We might think
[10:57] that he's showing up late to meet our
[11:00] needs, but everything is in his timing
[11:02] tonight. Amen. If you have a need
[11:03] tonight, you just want to lift that up
[11:04] before the Lord, ask for the mat to take
[11:06] us to the Lord in
[11:08] prayer. Let's bow our heads and pray.
[11:12] Dear heavenly father, we thank you for
[11:14] this night, Lord. This time to gather
[11:15] around your
[11:16] word among friends and family, believers
[11:19] of like, precious faith. Lord, truly,
[11:22] Lord, I thank you once again for my own
[11:24] lips, Lord. Thank you for protecting me.
[11:27] It can be a very scary thing. Thank you
[11:28] for being with Sister Fiona and her
[11:30] social security card issue. Lord, the
[11:33] worldly things and you have it all in
[11:35] control, Lord. Like the song says,
[11:37] you're the master of the wind and may
[11:39] you be the master of our hearts and our
[11:40] minds.
[11:41] this evening. Lord, let us enter into
[11:44] worship into praise. May you be pleased
[11:46] with it, Father. And just give us more
[11:48] of you and the revealing of your word to
[11:50] us tonight, Lord. We pray you be with
[11:53] the minister tonight, Lord, and each one
[11:56] of us as we hear your word. In Jesus
[11:57] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[12:02] Amen. You may be seated tonight. Amen.
[12:05] It's good to be in the Lord's house
[12:06] tonight. Once again, I want to welcome
[12:07] our visitors. Ginsky still have family
[12:09] with them and brother Yessa has family
[12:11] with him tonight from Belgium. Brother
[12:14] Sephole from Edmonton and the Simsons
[12:17] from Saskatchewan. So we want to welcome
[12:19] each one here tonight. And we want to
[12:20] invite the Lord to come and have his way
[12:22] and trust that he'll feel welcome. Amen.
[12:25] You ask me why I'm happy tonight. My
[12:27] sins are gone. How many can confess that
[12:30] tonight your sins are gone. Praise the
[12:32] Lord. You ask me why I'm happy. So I'll
[12:37] just tell you why.
[12:40] Because my sins are
[12:43] gone. And when I meet the scoffers who
[12:47] ask me where they are, I
[12:50] say my sins are
[12:53] gone. They're underneath the blood of
[12:57] the cross of Calvary.
[13:00] as far removed as darkness is from
[13:04] dawn. In the sea of God's
[13:07] forgetfulness, good enough for me.
[13:10] Praise
[13:11] God, my sins are
[13:15] gone. Was at the old time altar where
[13:19] God came in my heart and
[13:22] now my sins are
[13:25] gone. The Lord took full possession. The
[13:29] devil did depart. I'm
[13:33] glad my sins are
[13:35] gone. There underneath the blood of the
[13:40] cross of
[13:41] Calvary. As far removed as darkness is
[13:45] from
[13:46] no in the sea of God's
[13:49] forgetfulness. Good enough for me.
[13:52] Praise
[13:53] God. My sins are
[13:57] gone. When Satan comes to tempt me and
[14:01] he tries to make me down, I
[14:04] say my sins are
[14:07] gone. You've got me into trouble, but
[14:11] Jesus got me out. I'm
[14:14] glad my sins are gone.
[14:18] There underneath the blood of the cross
[14:22] of
[14:23] Calvary as far removed as darkness is
[14:26] from
[14:28] dawn in the sea of God's
[14:31] forgetfulness. Good enough for me.
[14:34] Praise
[14:35] God. My sins are
[14:38] gone. I'm living now for Jesus. Happy
[14:43] night and day
[14:45] because my sins are
[14:48] gone. My soul is filled with music. With
[14:53] all my heart I say, I
[14:56] know my sins are gone.
[15:00] There underneath the blood of the cross
[15:03] of
[15:04] Calvary as far removed as darkness is
[15:08] from
[15:09] dawn in the sea of God's
[15:12] forgetfulness. Good enough for me.
[15:15] Praise
[15:16] God. My sins are
[15:19] gone. There underneath the blood of the
[15:23] cross of Calvary.
[15:26] as far removed as darkness is from
[15:29] dawn. In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[15:33] that's good enough for me. Praise
[15:37] [Music]
[15:40] God. Oh, praise
[15:42] God. My sins are
[15:45] gone.
[15:48] Hallelujah. Oh, I have found a love that
[15:52] pardons.
[15:54] And I have found some stripes that
[15:58] heal. And I have found strength for my
[16:03] weakness. I found grace to cover all my
[16:08] sin. Oh, it's in
[16:11] Jesus. Oh, it's in
[16:13] Jesus. It's in Jesus. He is the
[16:18] one. He's a rock salvation.
[16:22] He's a firm
[16:24] foundation. It's in Jesus. Oh, he is the
[16:28] one. And I have found a friend and
[16:34] savior. I have found someone to
[16:39] care. I have found joy, peace, and
[16:44] comfort. It's in Jesus. He is my friend.
[16:49] Oh, it's in
[16:51] Jesus. Oh, it's in
[16:54] Jesus. It's in Jesus. He is the
[16:58] one. He's a rock of
[17:01] salvation. He's a firm
[17:04] foundation. It's in Jesus. He is the
[17:08] one. And I have found a blood that
[17:13] covers. Oh, it was spilled at Calary.
[17:18] [Music]
[17:19] And it has taken all my sins away. And
[17:25] now I praise his
[17:28] name. Oh, it's in
[17:31] Jesus. Oh, it's in
[17:34] Jesus. It's in Jesus. He is the
[17:38] one. He's a rock
[17:41] salvation. He's a firm
[17:44] foundation. It's in Jesus and he is.
[17:47] Sing it with chorus once again. Oh, it's
[17:50] in Jesus. Oh, it's in
[17:53] Jesus. It's in Jesus. He is the one.
[17:59] He's a rock of
[18:00] salvation. He's a firm
[18:03] foundation. It's in Jesus. He is the
[18:08] one.
[18:12] Hallelujah. Old course I was thinking of
[18:14] today. Oh Lord's in the power just now.
[18:16] How many want him to come and fall upon
[18:18] us tonight? I received a text from
[18:21] brother Robert that brother Emanuel and
[18:23] sister Deborah have a special force
[18:25] tonight. I don't see brother Emanuel,
[18:27] but if they're here and they want to try
[18:28] and get ready while we're singing this.
[18:30] Amen. Let's just sing the chorus. Oh

[18:41] Oh Lord, send the power just now.
[18:45] Oh Lord, send the power just now and

[31:29] Many have done greater deeds than we
[31:31] have, Father. Lord,
[31:34] but Lord, you said, "Fear not, little
[31:36] flock. It pleased the father to give you

[32:06] But it also pleased you to come and
[32:08] reveal it, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Not
[32:10] unto ourself, Lord, to find our way,

[32:54] you, Lord, to reveal unto us more and
[32:57] more, Father. Yes. As we look away unto
[32:59] you in thy word, we ask and pray in
[33:02] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. May the
[33:06] Lord bless us tonight.
[33:09] Uh once again want to thank uh everyone
[33:14] for making it to the service tonight.
[33:18] Not to keep us standing a lot. We'll
[33:21] just go into the Bible. Uh probably go
[33:26] have a short reading rather than taking
[33:28] Exodus 25. Let's go directly to first
[33:33] Peter 8 uh 5 verse 8.
[33:38] Thank you
[33:43] musicians. Thank you brother Mark for
[33:46] this song service and uh brother
[33:49] Billy wonderful songs by God's grace.
[33:52] Amen. Believe that uh all these songs
[33:56] uh go with us along the days as we
[33:59] listen to them at home and keeping us in
[34:03] the heavenly atmospheres. Amen. Be
[34:06] sober, be vigilant, because your
[34:09] adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion,
[34:12] walketh about, seeking whom he may
[34:14] devour, whom resist resist steadfast in
[34:18] the faith, knowing that the same
[34:20] afflictions are accomplished in your
[34:23] brethren that are in the world. But the
[34:26] God of all grace, who have called us
[34:30] unto his eternal glory by Jesus Christ,
[34:33] after that ye have suffered a while,
[34:37] make you perfect, establish, strengthen,
[34:40] settle you, to him be the glory, to him
[34:44] be glory and dominion forever and ever.
[34:48] Amen. Amen. May the Lord bless the
[34:51] reading of his word. You may be seated.
[34:53] While uh you are seated, let's take the
[34:55] book of Exodus
[34:58] chapter
[35:01] 25:31. And thou shalt make a candlestick
[35:04] of pure gold of beaten work shall the
[35:08] candlestick be made. His shaft and his
[35:11] branches, his balls, his uh um knots,
[35:15] his flowers shall be made of the same.
[35:19] and six branches shall come out of the
[35:22] of of the side of it. Uh three branches
[35:25] of the candlestick out of the one side
[35:28] and three branches of the candlestick
[35:30] out of the other side. Uh once again
[35:35] we'll be trying to
[35:37] cover we'll continuing with uh what we
[35:41] had started here. What house will thou
[35:43] build me? And uh I believe this will be
[35:45] part four and uh we'll be uh covering a
[35:48] little bit of the second part the second
[35:51] portion of the tabernacle which is u the
[35:54] holy place. Uh we understand that u
[35:59] these are broad subjects but we'll not
[36:02] make uh lengthy uh coverings of all
[36:05] these areas. So we'll just uh touch the
[36:08] principles of it that can uh help us
[36:11] drive and understand and dig deeper as
[36:15] the Lord allows to each one of us. But
[36:18] God's grace um we have uh started with
[36:22] uh this subject by God's grace from the
[36:26] beginning of the year or uh beginning of
[36:28] the year by God's grace and uh over this
[36:32] time God has given us the grace
[36:34] [Music]
[36:36] to go about seeing how the promise was
[36:40] given to Abraham. Abraham, all the
[36:42] children of Israel, how they were
[36:46] in Egypt, and the Lord told them to
[36:49] choose from the sheep and the goats and
[36:52] they had to make the choice because the
[36:55] life of the sheep or the lamb had to be
[37:00] a protection has to be the opening way
[37:03] for all the journey ahead because God
[37:06] came to the prophet and told him to
[37:08] bring the people to come and build him a
[37:10] tabernacle.
[37:11] so he can be worshiped among the people.
[37:13] And we understand that the prophet takes
[37:16] all those uh shadows and types and and
[37:19] brings it onto our level. It's not an
[37:22] historical uh speech of uh uh the
[37:27] tabernacle in the wilderness, but we
[37:30] talking of these tabernacle that we are
[37:33] of the Lord. And as the Lord covers uh
[37:36] this tabernacle that he's uh wanting to
[37:40] build upon us uh around us, we
[37:43] understand that we are product of our
[37:45] father and mother physically the prophet
[37:47] says. But nevertheless, he comes around
[37:50] to use that tabernacle to uh build forth
[37:54] a tabernacle that he himself the Lord
[37:56] Jesus Christ can come and dwell. And uh
[37:59] such a element can is very profound
[38:02] because uh along the ages um nobody has
[38:07] seen God, nobody can touch God, nobody
[38:10] can come around God, anybody that can
[38:12] see God will die. But nevertheless, it
[38:15] pleased the Lord that because he had all
[38:18] these types and shadows in the Old
[38:20] Testament and in the day of Jesus
[38:23] Christ, he came and uh shed his own
[38:25] blood for the tabernacles to come for
[38:29] him to come and dwell within. And as we
[38:32] look the book of Exodus and the book of
[38:35] Leviticus very profound uh with about
[38:39] this subject but uh to a certain degree
[38:42] people will believe yes Jesus died for
[38:45] us and the tabernacle of God will be uh
[38:49] with men and all these things. But then
[38:51] when God start fulfilling this prophecy,
[38:55] then people start having questions
[38:58] because those things that were never
[39:01] seen being done in the human flesh
[39:04] becomes so great to the point that
[39:07] people are unable to reconcile. But then
[39:10] God, every single time that he does
[39:13] something, he doesn't literally repeat
[39:16] the same thing, but he always have some
[39:19] changes to his plan, but his principles
[39:22] remain the same. Amen. Because in the
[39:24] wilderness, he built the tabernacle in
[39:27] Exodus 40. Uh the pillar of fire came
[39:29] down in the
[39:31] tabernacle. The tabernacle didn't
[39:33] explode because God came down. But then
[39:37] when people look they say like you know
[39:39] now Moses you're just trying to make
[39:42] yourself
[39:43] God you're trying to just have an
[39:45] authority upon us but then that
[39:48] principle God will remain with that
[39:50] principle the same the same way that God
[39:54] went into Genesis when men and Adam and
[39:58] Eve fell brother say the man stepped out
[40:01] of the bowl of light and took the lamp
[40:03] and swle it and covered the uh Adam and
[40:06] Eve. And that same principle goes on
[40:10] into Genesis 14. God comes down and
[40:13] veils himself in the
[40:16] flesh and uh takes the bread and wine
[40:19] and gives to Abraham. God didn't expose
[40:22] either, right? And then he goes on to
[40:26] Genesis uh um 18 and comes and talks to
[40:30] Abraham.
[40:32] Butam says in one of the quote he says
[40:34] like you know those three people was the
[40:36] same person. Amen. And he goes on and
[40:39] turns around it say like you know the
[40:41] one that said with Abraham was Eli
[40:44] Elohim the self-sustaining God. Amen.
[40:50] And this all this time, God was using
[40:55] materials that were made taken out of
[40:58] the dust in order for him to have
[41:00] communion with the people. Amen.
[41:03] And the Lord comes back around and comes
[41:06] down in the form of the angel speaking
[41:08] to Manowak wife and said that hey drink
[41:13] take no uh alcohol and all kind of
[41:17] strong drinks because you're going to
[41:19] conceive a son. Brother Brham said that
[41:22] the angel of the Lord came down. The
[41:24] Lord Jesus Christ stood there and spoke
[41:26] with them. God didn't explode either.
[41:30] And then he comes back around in the
[41:32] time of
[41:34] Jesus. In the time of in the days of
[41:36] Jesus, they call him
[41:39] Belville. He turned around and they
[41:42] called him like he's a bastard.
[41:45] that yet the fulfillment of the prophecy
[41:48] that they were looking for because when
[41:50] Moses took the stone and break the the
[41:53] the tables, there had to be a change of
[41:57] administration or the change of
[41:58] ministry.
[42:00] And when God saw that it was enough of
[42:03] me always trying to contend with men, he
[42:07] say I have to come and live in them. And
[42:10] he gives the promise. said, "I will
[42:13] write my laws on their heart." I will
[42:16] give them a new spirit. That's right.
[42:19] Because as always, I'm always outside of
[42:22] the tabernacle, it's always a
[42:24] contention.
[42:26] Amen. When the pastor of a church or the
[42:29] father of the church is not in a good
[42:32] relationship with the family, it's
[42:35] always a contention.
[42:37] I don't agree with your dad. I don't
[42:38] agree with my pastor. I don't agree with
[42:40] the prophet because that all of them
[42:43] they don't have the same spirit right
[42:46] and since they don't have the same
[42:47] spirit it it's always contentions
[42:51] we look around the world that's what is
[42:54] happening we see countries rising
[42:57] against one
[42:59] another communist against capitalist and
[43:02] against socialist and back and forth why
[43:05] because the spirits are trying to find
[43:08] who is greater among them.
[43:12] And here we are now in Jesus' time.
[43:14] Jesus come about and sheds his blood and
[43:18] comes back around and speaks and
[43:21] meets Paul along the
[43:24] way. And he started using Paul, the
[43:27] great man that the Bible has ever seen.
[43:32] He took the Old Testament and reconciled
[43:35] it with the events that the uh the
[43:38] Pharisees and Sadducees could not
[43:40] reconcile. Amen. To know what kind of
[43:44] ministry was living among them.
[43:47] And so it is the challenge in this day
[43:50] people who are called to be Christians
[43:54] standing with the word with the Bible
[43:55] with all the understanding to be able to
[43:58] reconcile. What kind of ministry have we
[44:01] received in this hour? And in order to
[44:04] know when God takes the turns to use the
[44:07] bride form to fulfill the rest of the uh
[44:11] prophecies that are contained in the
[44:13] Bible. Amen. And when we see all these
[44:17] things around us, when people try to
[44:21] avoid what the ministry has come and
[44:24] been fulfilled from 1909 to 1965,
[44:29] then all of a
[44:30] sudden the church is weak. Amen. The
[44:34] church now will turn to psychology to
[44:38] science in order to find a holding place
[44:42] in order for them to find a way to know
[44:45] what they are. Amen. So it is when the
[44:48] church turns now to the to psychology
[44:50] and all the great understanding and
[44:54] knowledge then they start questioning
[44:58] who is God? Why should we have a pastor?
[45:02] Why should we listen to one? Why should
[45:04] I pay my tithe to somebody that I don't
[45:06] see? I'm giving it to a man. I'm not
[45:09] giving it to God because I don't see
[45:11] God. Why? Because the principle from
[45:15] Genesis that God will had to veil
[45:18] himself amen in a flesh in a certain
[45:22] form. Because God will never come down
[45:25] in a form of a
[45:26] cat. He will never take the form of a
[45:29] dog. Amen. He will always use human
[45:33] beings.
[45:35] Yet human beings now trying now to walk
[45:39] away from their
[45:41] promises to give their responsibilities
[45:45] to AI and machinery in order to do that
[45:48] work for them. Amen. Therefore, the Lord
[45:51] comes down and said, "What house will
[45:53] thou build
[45:55] me? a house of mechanical
[45:58] devices of roads and psychology of all
[46:01] these
[46:02] things. No, but it says like you know it
[46:05] says this tabernacle Moses you go down
[46:09] and you tell the children of Israel that
[46:12] came forth and chose the lamb by their
[46:15] own choosing. Amen. And came and gave
[46:19] willingly to build me this tabernacle.
[46:22] every single stage that I am bringing
[46:25] all these elements in order for them to
[46:28] build the tabernacle not after their own
[46:30] understanding but according to the
[46:32] pattern. Right? And here the pattern now
[46:36] in the holy place in the middle place we
[46:38] understand we have uh the candlestick
[46:41] and we have the table the the the table
[46:44] of shoeb bread and we have the table of
[46:47] incense and and all these things covers
[46:50] a lot as I said a lot of uh materials
[46:52] and stuff but we don't want to take two
[46:57] five 10 15 services into one area but
[47:02] instead I'm hitting the presence
[47:03] principles that will drive the
[47:06] understanding of all those areas. Amen.
[47:09] Because the candlestick shows us is the
[47:12] type of the seven church edges.
[47:15] The candlestick is the top of the
[47:18] mind. The candlestick is the type of the
[47:22] spirit. We understand as human beings we
[47:25] are body uh body, spirit and and the
[47:29] soul.
[47:31] And each stage
[47:34] represent the reason why I'm even taking
[47:37] the candlestick specifically is to show
[47:41] forth why the spirit why this second
[47:45] stage of the tabernacle had to be
[47:48] specifically the
[47:49] spirit and the spirit is made of verbam
[47:54] shows us out of five
[47:56] uh outlets or channels and imaginations
[48:00] memories memory, affections and and
[48:02] conscious and and so
[48:05] forth. And these five elements, each one
[48:08] of us possesses it. Amen. From our
[48:10] birth, we are trained to learn how to
[48:13] memorize and to learn how to have
[48:15] affections toward one another and
[48:19] things. And at times now the result that
[48:24] our imaginations the way we understand
[48:28] life around us is the result of uh
[48:32] what our countries or our cultures I'm
[48:35] quoting the
[48:37] prophet has made out of us.
[48:41] Amen. Allow me not to read everything.
[48:44] I'll just I'm flying over but references
[48:47] of all this. you take uh the greatest
[48:49] battle ever fought in enticing spirits,
[48:52] those two messages should be able to tie
[48:54] everything that I'm saying here by God's
[48:56] grace. Amen.
[48:59] And all these five senses or five
[49:03] outlets that we have been given
[49:07] onto is the result of our first birth.
[49:13] We can have more affections
[49:16] based on the fact that I can remember
[49:18] this is my
[49:20] wife. I can have more affections to
[49:23] somebody that I grew up with.
[49:26] Comparatively to somebody that just
[49:28] walks up there, you might not even have
[49:30] affection for him. You look at him, you
[49:33] can spit on him, you can have him locked
[49:36] up, you can have him destroyed or killed
[49:39] because you cannot relate to him. At
[49:43] times we see that in the street somebody
[49:45] comes to you help me brother and said I
[49:48] am not your
[49:49] brother because our conscious doesn't
[49:52] tell us that he is your brother.
[49:55] Amen. because our memory
[49:58] doesn't bring back that this person I'm
[50:02] acquainted
[50:04] to and therefore that's the type of
[50:08] world that we are in
[50:09] today and that's where all the
[50:12] psychology comes into play.
[50:16] You have more affection to somebody who
[50:18] has more intellectual who can uh resolve
[50:23] the things of the world and bring
[50:25] solutions to things
[50:28] and you can go all the way to defend him
[50:30] and may have all the public show for
[50:32] him.
[50:34] Why?
[50:36] Because our spirits has been shaped like
[50:40] that. Amen. Our memories has been filled
[50:44] with all kind of things. Amen. We go and
[50:48] we watch all kind of movies and you
[50:51] learn how to be affectionate toward a
[50:54] woman based on what you've seen in
[50:55] movies. Right? If he doesn't come and
[50:59] open the door for you is not a
[51:01] gentleman. Where did you learn it? From
[51:04] TV.
[51:08] Sir, nowhere in the Bible it shows you
[51:11] that Philip walked next to
[51:14] uh the
[51:16] inotropia that did
[51:19] that. But then when we looked when we
[51:22] use our eyes and we saw those things, it
[51:25] was very
[51:27] captivating and our memories were sealed
[51:30] with those things and it becomes second
[51:33] nature to us. Amen.
[51:35] We do those things by the fact that oh
[51:38] that's how it is
[51:40] done. Don't you know you have to buy me
[51:43] this big ring? Don't you know that you
[51:45] have to be on your knees? You have to
[51:47] kneel for you to ask me in
[51:49] marriage. And if he doesn't do that is m
[51:54] what's the word message? Um misogyny.
[51:58] What's the word again?
[52:01] Mogistic.
[52:04] Why our
[52:06] affections were driven by a background
[52:10] in the world that you lived in.
[52:14] If you lived in an area where there's no
[52:16] TV, there's no such thing. You go to the
[52:19] elders before you have went on before
[52:22] you. How do you talk to a
[52:25] girl when you don't know how to pray?
[52:28] You go to the to the pastor. You say,
[52:30] "Pastor, how do I pray?" That's right.
[52:33] So did the disciple went to Jesus teach
[52:36] us how to pray. Amen. Because the
[52:40] affection the the conscience the memory
[52:43] had to be affected by a certain teaching
[52:47] and all of us we are the product of
[52:50] that. Amen.
[52:52] When you come in the
[52:54] message we find that we have a certain
[52:57] pattern of talking
[53:00] in the
[53:01] message. And when you come in the
[53:03] message we everyone has to say brother
[53:06] Bam say brother Bam say brother Bam
[53:08] say and that's the our memory reminds us
[53:13] that if I need to appeal to the
[53:16] congregation or to somebody yeah brother
[53:18] bam is saying that then the memory of
[53:21] the one I'm talking to realizes that oh
[53:24] that's brother Brenham that's not my
[53:28] brother and that has become culture
[53:30] among
[53:33] Instead of the word being recognized
[53:37] when as Jesus said my sheep he know my
[53:41] voice
[53:43] can recognize the word. Amen. Now we
[53:47] have
[53:47] slogans in order to trigger that memory
[53:50] in us to know that that's the
[53:55] word and that has become a part of us.
[53:59] And when you go from one church to
[54:01] another, they have a different type of
[54:04] teaching, different place of focus.
[54:08] Some places is a more uh um uh church
[54:13] order
[54:14] focus and other places more um place of
[54:18] a woman focused.
[54:23] All these
[54:25] things are showing us the world in which
[54:29] we are living in. Amen.
[54:32] When you come and you can see how
[54:35] friendly the people in the church are.
[54:37] Brother Brham says, "Watch the spirit."
[54:39] Look at it on the
[54:42] pulpit. You come and you see the pastor
[54:45] so friendly. Look at the church.
[54:47] Quickly, you'll find that they're all
[54:48] alike.
[54:52] If the pastor is so hard and very direct
[54:56] and the things quickly before you see
[54:58] it, that's the seed that is being swed
[55:00] in the land. Amen.
[55:04] And here we are brother now or the Bible
[55:07] I'm taking the principle now of the
[55:09] Bible in Brana it shows that you know
[55:11] this spirit he said make it of a beaten
[55:17] work that the candlestick that we are
[55:21] given here is made of a beaten work.
[55:24] Amen. And this memory and stuff, brother
[55:28] is now bringing
[55:30] out a principle that I looked and I
[55:33] said,
[55:34] "Wow, this goes
[55:37] beyond nations and cultures and anything
[55:42] that we have ever heard or ever
[55:45] seen because this spirit veram or the
[55:50] prophet is showing us that we are the
[55:53] Lord wants to build a tabernacle
[55:56] and this tabernacle is making it in a
[55:59] certain
[56:01] manner. We had seen about the body and
[56:05] the body had to be made of in a certain
[56:10] uh taken care of in a certain
[56:12] conditions. No printing on the
[56:15] body, no defiling the body and all these
[56:19] things is preparing that tabernacle for
[56:21] himself. Amen.
[56:23] And now we understand that all of us are
[56:26] born and our backgrounds and everything
[56:29] that we just seen we have all a certain
[56:33] spirit
[56:37] and that spirit some of us are born with
[56:40] that spirit yet we are sons of God
[56:43] because Baron says that each one of us
[56:46] at the time of our birth not the spirit
[56:49] yet but the seed of God was sitting
[56:51] there standing standing next to our
[56:53] mothers and waiting for the body to come
[56:56] out in order to get in.
[57:01] So God for knowledge
[57:03] knew us before the foundation of the
[57:05] world knew that that body that's mother
[57:09] and father will direct them to come and
[57:11] meet in a certain time and bring forth
[57:14] thy seed in order to produce the body
[57:17] that we are. And at the very time of our
[57:21] birth, God takes a part of him and puts
[57:24] in us. And that's what we call soul.
[57:28] A part of God. Praise the Lord. But yet
[57:32] it's we're not talking about the soul
[57:34] yet. And God now is showing us that in
[57:39] the body then we have the
[57:47] spirit enticing
[57:50] spirit. Brother Bam is showing us here
[57:53] paragraph 37. I want to speak on
[57:56] enticing
[57:57] spirit which will be really titled
[58:00] demonology.
[58:01] You hear so much about demons these
[58:04] days, but you hear so little about how
[58:06] to get rid of it.
[58:10] We all are well aware that there's
[58:12] devils, but the next thing is how to get
[58:15] rid of that thing. And now there's uh by
[58:18] have by God's grace much opportunity to
[58:21] deal by God's grace much opportunity to
[58:24] deal with these things called demons and
[58:27] meeting them at the platform uh and in a
[58:31] daily walk and why I would like to look
[58:34] into the scripture this morning and uh
[58:37] and find out just what those things
[58:41] are. the same sermon
[58:43] 39. This morning we'll talk we'll talk
[58:46] about demons in a spiritual form in the
[58:50] soul. They're in the soul the same as
[58:54] they in the body. And the and and we are
[58:58] bound to admit that we see them in
[59:02] people's body such as cancers and
[59:06] different diseases and in the human
[59:09] body.
[59:11] The same way those spirits are working
[59:14] in the body, the same way they are also
[59:18] in the soul, they are also in the
[59:20] spirit. Amen.
[59:24] And now these demons understand, brother
[59:27] Brham says that the devil is not what
[59:30] they showing us that the devil has a
[59:32] tail and and some roof and some some
[59:34] fork of of of something. He said, "No,
[59:38] no, no, no. He's very intellectual.
[59:42] Amen.
[59:46] He's very wise.
[59:49] He's very
[59:51] cunning. And the Lord is coming now to
[59:55] show us those demons in people's
[1:00:01] bodies. As we are walking around the
[1:00:04] spirit as I just broke it down that some
[1:00:08] of us we come to
[1:00:09] church we took the church spirit
[1:00:13] rather than God's spirit
[1:00:16] and then God comes around and said I
[1:00:19] will give you a new spirit
[1:00:23] because some of us from our backgrounds
[1:00:26] we don't even like
[1:00:28] ourselves I'm quoting brother Brennham
[1:00:31] he said like you At times we don't even
[1:00:33] get along with ourselves. Amen.
[1:00:37] I don't like my
[1:00:40] hair. Now I am very complex because I
[1:00:44] think that the next sister or the next
[1:00:46] brother is much better than I
[1:00:49] am. And God say I have to give you a new
[1:00:53] spirit. Amen. That new spirit is not the
[1:00:56] Holy Ghost yet.
[1:01:00] And now he's placing that we need to
[1:01:03] understand that this spirit is to get us
[1:01:08] along in order for us to quieten us a
[1:01:11] little
[1:01:13] bit because everything that we were
[1:01:16] being we were everything that we were
[1:01:18] born and our cultures and all the
[1:01:21] history and all the things that the more
[1:01:24] we go into history with all with our old
[1:01:28] spirit. The more we are disgust and the
[1:01:31] more we hate one another, the more we uh
[1:01:35] we don't like one another.
[1:01:39] Because the more you go into Israel
[1:01:41] without the Holy Ghost,
[1:01:45] the more you become judgmental. Amen.
[1:01:48] The more you start to question
[1:01:50] everything.
[1:01:52] Because you just can't find your way.
[1:01:54] Right? You find all kind of writers and
[1:01:57] this one says one thing
[1:02:00] and tells you all these things here.
[1:02:03] This is one thing that uh I've seen in
[1:02:06] the
[1:02:07] libraries. Depending on the library that
[1:02:09] you've ever been
[1:02:11] to, if you look at the way the libraries
[1:02:15] are
[1:02:15] set, they limit the your uh your point
[1:02:21] of
[1:02:22] view. They can have give you a certain
[1:02:25] fictional
[1:02:27] world love and this guy and went and he
[1:02:31] murdered this this person and and he did
[1:02:34] this here and in your entire life now
[1:02:37] you are living in a fictional
[1:02:42] world. Oh, I'm waiting for the prince to
[1:02:45] come. When the prince will come, he will
[1:02:48] talk this way. He will have so much
[1:02:50] money and all these things.
[1:02:53] What is that? Library,
[1:02:56] books and and all these
[1:03:00] things and the product that comes out of
[1:03:04] it and uh the other fellow that comes to
[1:03:08] it if it doesn't match that fictional
[1:03:11] world,
[1:03:14] it's a disappointment. Amen. Just as we
[1:03:17] come to when we come to
[1:03:20] church, we come to look for God of
[1:03:22] miracles according to our
[1:03:26] understanding, we look for him. God help
[1:03:29] me. I I need to come to church and they
[1:03:32] have to help me. If they don't help me,
[1:03:34] that means that God is not among
[1:03:36] us. Because our mind was already
[1:03:40] inclined based of our own understanding.
[1:03:44] That's why the Bible say lean not to
[1:03:47] your own understanding. Amen. By leaning
[1:03:52] to our own understanding. Here we are.
[1:03:55] We find ourselves struggling day and
[1:03:57] night.
[1:04:00] I don't think brother Brandham is good.
[1:04:02] I brother Brandham has made mistakes
[1:04:04] here and there. God say no no no
[1:04:07] no. I'll give you a new spirit. Amen.
[1:04:11] Thank you Lord. And this new spirit is
[1:04:14] made out of beaten work. Amen. And the
[1:04:17] beaten work is not an easy path.
[1:04:23] To make a beaten work, it takes
[1:04:27] time. The beaten work is in a a very
[1:04:31] long
[1:04:33] journey. God comes and tells Moses said
[1:04:37] like here's the tabernacle. Here's the
[1:04:40] vision. God comes and tells the bride,
[1:04:43] you are my bride, but you have to come
[1:04:45] up higher.
[1:04:47] And now that journey to come up higher,
[1:04:51] it's not a overnight walk.
[1:04:54] Unfortunately,
[1:04:56] that's right. Many came to the message
[1:04:58] 1977, the rapture's coming, everything
[1:05:01] will be
[1:05:02] done. Before they know it, it was 19 uh
[1:05:05] 1980.
[1:05:08] Then it was 1990.
[1:05:11] that now because they had not received
[1:05:14] yet a new spirit, they walked away.
[1:05:21] It was not even yet the Holy Ghost
[1:05:26] because if they had received a new
[1:05:29] spirit, that new spirit, brother Ram
[1:05:31] said, will help you to always believe
[1:05:35] what God says. Amen.
[1:05:38] will bring all the imaginations that we
[1:05:41] have, all the memories that we have into
[1:05:45] a different perspective than what we
[1:05:48] have ever thought it could be or will
[1:05:50] be. Right?
[1:05:52] Because God said to the children of
[1:05:54] Israel, stay behind the ark because this
[1:05:58] path you've never been there before.
[1:06:01] But yet the children of Israel wanted to
[1:06:05] find their own way. Amen. They came into
[1:06:08] the land. They looked at the rest of the
[1:06:11] nations. They say, "We want to be like
[1:06:13] the rest of them."
[1:06:16] But Ron says it is like for the young
[1:06:18] people. He said like, you know, I went I
[1:06:21] went there to to the museum and they
[1:06:23] were talking about David Crockett or
[1:06:26] somebody like that. He said like, you
[1:06:28] know, look, they said like, you know, he
[1:06:30] killed a bear at 3 years old. They said
[1:06:31] like, you know, that's such a nonsense
[1:06:34] like that.
[1:06:36] You say you see that's where the young
[1:06:38] people find the refuge to go and learn
[1:06:41] of all those kind of things quickly you
[1:06:45] refresh your mind you say
[1:06:47] oh but then they were reading those
[1:06:49] books and going to those
[1:06:51] cinemas and today now those things have
[1:06:55] changed into all kind of apps of movies
[1:06:57] and entertainment and all these places
[1:07:00] people are going to
[1:07:03] without realizing That by exposing
[1:07:08] ourself to those things quickly we are
[1:07:12] turning into the image of those
[1:07:14] elements. Be our memory stems. Our
[1:07:18] imagination is stems. Then we start
[1:07:20] understanding that oh affection is this
[1:07:23] way
[1:07:24] memory you should be this way.
[1:07:27] Consciousness has to be this
[1:07:30] way. But that was not
[1:07:33] it. Bam is showing us that disease here
[1:07:36] is in the
[1:07:39] people. Enticing spirit paragraph 90. Uh
[1:07:43] among among a lot of people we find
[1:07:46] where emotions and so forth they become
[1:07:49] tattling
[1:07:51] backbiting and all kinds of ungodly
[1:07:54] things. But brother uh brother does
[1:07:58] sulfuric acid in the church. It's demon
[1:08:02] power spirit of men and women who who
[1:08:07] who get one another and try to push off
[1:08:10] and say this is not right. This is not
[1:08:13] right and that's not right. If you chase
[1:08:17] it down, nine times out of 10 is the
[1:08:21] very person making the stir that's not
[1:08:25] right. Amen.
[1:08:30] because of all the imaginations and all
[1:08:32] the ideas that we have
[1:08:36] it turns us into a different person
[1:08:39] then we start going around oh you know
[1:08:42] you know you are this you know people
[1:08:44] like you you know you deserve this and
[1:08:47] people like you cannot hang out with
[1:08:49] such a people and people like this and
[1:08:51] you bam says nine times out of
[1:08:55] 10 you trace it
[1:08:58] No, it's the person himself
[1:09:01] because the person has a complex
[1:09:03] somewhere right the person wants to
[1:09:06] build a
[1:09:09] society lift himself above the stars of
[1:09:12] God and when you trace it back who
[1:09:15] started it the devil himself. Amen.
[1:09:19] And brother says like you know the same
[1:09:21] spirit is the demon in the people.
[1:09:27] But glory be to God. God said, "I will
[1:09:29] give you a new spirit."
[1:09:33] Thank you, Lord.
[1:09:36] We can find ourselves even ministers on
[1:09:38] the
[1:09:40] pulpit. Oh, that doctrine is not right.
[1:09:42] That doctrine, that doctrine, that
[1:09:44] doctrine, this doctrine, that doctrine.
[1:09:46] Then what
[1:09:51] doctrine? Nine times out of 10, here's
[1:09:54] the problem. Amen.
[1:09:57] He's trying to we'll read the quote but
[1:10:00] he's trying
[1:10:01] to find his way in the heart of the
[1:10:05] people. It is the same thing as we have
[1:10:09] covered on the the ministries of
[1:10:12] ministry of of the sanctuary.
[1:10:16] the sons of Aaron, the son of Eli, how
[1:10:19] they were finding their ways into the
[1:10:21] women in the church and and coming to
[1:10:24] offer a a different offering than what
[1:10:27] God has uh uh required them to
[1:10:31] do our imaginations and our mind and our
[1:10:35] spirit and being all these things
[1:10:40] here. That's right. It
[1:10:44] says, "Amen. God hates discord among
[1:10:48] among brethren.
[1:10:50] Be
[1:10:50] reverent. Be holy. Love God. Stand by
[1:10:55] him. As long as you know your life is
[1:10:59] diving up with the Bible,
[1:11:03] with purity of heart, listen to this.
[1:11:07] with purity of thought,
[1:11:10] love towards your brother, trying your
[1:11:14] best to build up the kingdom, to build
[1:11:17] the tabernacle,
[1:11:21] and doing those things. Listen to this.
[1:11:24] dressing right,
[1:11:27] living right,
[1:11:29] talking right,
[1:11:30] going right places,
[1:11:34] then you can have all the emotions you
[1:11:37] want to and
[1:11:39] everybody will believe it. Amen.
[1:11:45] As we are this tabernacle,
[1:11:49] the focus of the church.
[1:11:53] No, I can't put I can't I can't I can't
[1:11:55] leave the extensions because my hair you
[1:11:58] follow behind a
[1:12:00] complex idea behind it
[1:12:05] and that's it spirit. Brother says like
[1:12:08] those are demon oppressions on the
[1:12:11] people. Amen. That's right. I am sure I
[1:12:15] need to put some high heels. You follow
[1:12:17] that a complex spirit behind it. Right.
[1:12:20] Oppressing the people.
[1:12:27] the same message. Paragraph 50. But when
[1:12:30] your confession says one thing, listen
[1:12:32] to this, and your life leaves another,
[1:12:36] there's something wrong somewhere. Amen.
[1:12:42] There's something wrong somewhere. This
[1:12:44] is not something to come and push on a
[1:12:48] brother or on a sister. Sister, you need
[1:12:50] to dress this way. brother, you need to
[1:12:52] dress this way. But as we just read,
[1:12:54] brother says like, you know, people are
[1:12:57] invaded by these demons. At times, we
[1:13:00] hear so much about them, but then how do
[1:13:02] we get rid of them?
[1:13:06] We find that all these invasions, we see
[1:13:09] them in the form of high heels and and
[1:13:12] painting the nails and coloring the hair
[1:13:14] and all these things despise of the
[1:13:16] promises of God. What we see that behind
[1:13:20] there there is a spirit hidden. Amen.
[1:13:24] And because now it has become society
[1:13:27] has stemped our mind that a good hair
[1:13:30] looks this way. Everybody follows that,
[1:13:35] right? Because society has said like you
[1:13:38] know lifestyle has to be this way.
[1:13:41] Everybody follows that.
[1:13:46] Why our
[1:13:48] spirit being taken over
[1:13:51] by invasions?
[1:13:53] That's why brother preaches the message
[1:13:55] the invasions of the United States. And
[1:13:59] when you listen to that sermon, it it
[1:14:01] literally shows you that that came from
[1:14:04] Hollywood.
[1:14:06] And Hollywood is the televisions. It's
[1:14:08] today is all the applications that we
[1:14:10] have. is the flow of information in one
[1:14:14] shape or another in in a in a certain
[1:14:17] influence in the church in the home. Try
[1:14:21] not to keep up with the drone.
[1:14:26] He has a car. Give me a car. She has a
[1:14:28] new phone. Give me the phone. He has a a
[1:14:31] new a uh some new shoes. Give me some
[1:14:35] new
[1:14:36] shoes. The people traveling. Let us also
[1:14:39] travel.
[1:14:42] Why? Because it's demon possession to a
[1:14:46] certain degree. Amen.
[1:14:49] Don't you see that one? Don't you see
[1:14:50] that one? Don't you see that one? Don't
[1:14:52] you see that one? Oh, this one is the
[1:14:54] issue. Oh, we shouldn't be listening to
[1:14:56] him. Oh, he is the problem. Oh, he has
[1:14:58] done this. Nine times out of the 10,
[1:15:01] it's not all the pointing fingers, but
[1:15:04] it's all the four, five fingers pointing
[1:15:06] back. Amen.
[1:15:10] Ah brother, do you do you really believe
[1:15:12] this? H do you do you do you do you I
[1:15:14] don't really like this type of people
[1:15:16] around me. The problem is not the
[1:15:18] people. That's right. The problem is you
[1:15:22] William Brham say the greatest enemy of
[1:15:25] William Brandham
[1:15:29] nine times out of
[1:15:32] 10 and this is the greatest battle ever
[1:15:35] fought. Amen.
[1:15:38] to say, "Lord, this tabernacle that you
[1:15:41] have given me, this portion of land that
[1:15:44] you have given me, I'll take care of it.
[1:15:47] I'll protect
[1:15:49] it despite of all that the world has to
[1:15:52] give to us. But I'm taking this
[1:15:58] here." That's because you've got an
[1:16:00] intellectual faith continues. That's
[1:16:03] because you've got an intellectual faith
[1:16:05] and not a faith from your heart. And
[1:16:08] that shows that outside here is a
[1:16:10] knowledge of God. We know about the
[1:16:13] message. We read about the
[1:16:16] message. But inside is a demon of
[1:16:20] doubting. That's right. That's right.
[1:16:24] A demon of doubting. I believe in divine
[1:16:27] healing. I believe Brother Brandham is
[1:16:29] the prophet. But it's not for me.
[1:16:32] Brother Brham said like cover your body
[1:16:34] but it's not for me. Brother Brham said
[1:16:37] pay your tithe but it's not for
[1:16:40] me. Why? Because it's a demon of
[1:16:44] doubting. And when that demon of
[1:16:46] doubting takes its place before you know
[1:16:50] it it becomes a natural thing for us.
[1:16:54] Yeah. Why? No. No. No. No. The preacher
[1:16:58] the church. No no no. I can't I can't
[1:17:00] give my money. No, no, no. Respect my
[1:17:02] parents. Why you? No, no, no. The law
[1:17:04] says I'm 18 now. I'm free. I can do
[1:17:07] anything that I want.
[1:17:10] Yet we grew up in the message.
[1:17:13] Yet we grew up in the church.
[1:17:17] We know all the quotations. Yeah, I know
[1:17:19] that. Oh, brother. I've heard that
[1:17:21] quotation. What is that? A demon of
[1:17:24] doubting behind all those things. Amen.
[1:17:28] We listen to the word. We listen to the
[1:17:30] word intellectual faith. We have the
[1:17:32] knowledge. Even look at what society
[1:17:35] does. It comes and tells you, "Oh,
[1:17:37] somebody like you, you have high
[1:17:41] IQ. You have great
[1:17:45] memory. You are so affectionate. Oh, you
[1:17:48] care when people are rejecting the
[1:17:51] homosexuals and transgenders and oh, you
[1:17:55] are so
[1:17:57] affectionate. They come and even they
[1:17:59] prime you they give you all the
[1:18:05] decorations like in the case we see in
[1:18:07] the businesses they give you a triple
[1:18:09] triple A uh that's why triple a monk a a
[1:18:15] good rating all now all that community
[1:18:18] oh are we recommending this business
[1:18:21] right
[1:18:22] then when you look at yourself how far
[1:18:25] we have gone
[1:18:28] But glory be to God because he has
[1:18:30] called us to be his bride. There's a way
[1:18:32] back. Thank you Lord. There's always a
[1:18:36] way back. Despite of where we can find
[1:18:39] ourselves in this condition, that
[1:18:41] condition, there's always a way back.
[1:18:45] But then when you hear my voice, the
[1:18:47] Bible say, harden not your heart. Amen.
[1:18:51] as in the temptation when they tempted
[1:18:54] God, God opened the earth and then
[1:18:57] swallowed them up. That's right. And the
[1:19:00] earth is the representation of the
[1:19:02] flesh. You will turn, you'll still come
[1:19:05] to church and you'll still be doing
[1:19:07] everything that so-called the Christians
[1:19:09] are doing and all these things, but then
[1:19:11] you already done, you've already passed
[1:19:13] the demarcation line. But that's not
[1:19:16] what God is looking for onto us tonight.
[1:19:18] He said like you know what what kind
[1:19:20] what kind of house are we building onto
[1:19:23] it? Amen. It's built according to the
[1:19:27] word revealed word of the of the hour.
[1:19:33] Get it brother say uh uh that's not for
[1:19:36] me. H it could be so but I don't believe
[1:19:38] it. Get it? Outside you say yes. Inside
[1:19:42] your conscience you said no.
[1:19:46] I don't know if the quotation is there
[1:19:48] brother enticing spirit paragraph 40 is
[1:19:51] the one that we have there if you can
[1:19:53] project for the
[1:19:55] brother the same scientific thing that
[1:19:58] would prove that wasn't right uh that
[1:20:01] wasn't right prove it now the new spirit
[1:20:04] now this new spirit that god he's giving
[1:20:08] unto
[1:20:10] us Ephesians church age but not only is
[1:20:14] the candlestick of of gold is of beaten
[1:20:17] gold. Handcrafted of beaten gold
[1:20:21] according to her
[1:20:24] blueprint which were was spirit given
[1:20:28] outside of the of the Lord and master
[1:20:30] Jesus Christ was ever people so beaten
[1:20:33] and purged as the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:20:36] Surely she is filling up the suffering
[1:20:40] that Christ has left behind. Her goods
[1:20:44] are despoiled. Her life is in jeopardy.
[1:20:47] She's accounted as sheep for slaughter.
[1:20:50] She is killed all day long. She suffers
[1:20:54] much. But in uh in it all all retaliates
[1:20:58] not. Neither does she cause other to
[1:21:01] suffer.
[1:21:03] Worthy of the gospel is the lovely bread
[1:21:05] of Jesus of Christ.
[1:21:08] And as gold is malleable, whereas brass
[1:21:12] will will break with with the beating,
[1:21:15] this gold of God will bear her suffering
[1:21:19] of for the Lord, not bowed, not broken,
[1:21:22] not destroyed, but formed as a thing of
[1:21:25] beauty and a joy forever by the trials
[1:21:30] and testing of this life.
[1:21:34] The prophet is showing us that
[1:21:36] this
[1:21:38] candlestick that represent our
[1:21:41] spirit. He said that this candlestick is
[1:21:44] made out of beaten work. Amen. This
[1:21:47] beaten work it shows us that this is by
[1:21:49] the trials and testing of this
[1:21:52] life. While the world is pointing you to
[1:21:55] into one directions, the word come say
[1:21:58] you know no take the take the other.
[1:22:01] When the world takes right and he says
[1:22:04] take left.
[1:22:07] It is a great battle. Amen. It is not
[1:22:10] easy. Right now when you go to work and
[1:22:13] when you go to school as a young man or
[1:22:16] young girl and you see the entire class
[1:22:18] and dressing in pants and and having
[1:22:22] hearings and and necklace of all kinds
[1:22:25] and and you find yourself in there but
[1:22:28] say those are the trials. That's right.
[1:22:31] Those are the challenges that you have
[1:22:33] to face
[1:22:38] in such a
[1:22:40] simplicity is showing us hey look this
[1:22:43] situation that you finding yourself
[1:22:46] in while this business deal tells you oh
[1:22:49] it's okay you know those people you know
[1:22:52] we you don't need to worry you won't see
[1:22:54] how you know the whole deal will happen
[1:22:57] you'll just have your return on your
[1:23:00] investment will be just $100 100fold or
[1:23:04] 200fold. He is so cunning. Yes. At times
[1:23:09] that's where the the beauty of the word,
[1:23:12] the revelation of the word that if I'm a
[1:23:14] businessman, the investment that I'm I'm
[1:23:16] breaking into, the Lord takes you a
[1:23:18] little bit deeper than that. Amen.
[1:23:22] before you know it. Oh no, I thought
[1:23:24] like, you know, the business was a good
[1:23:25] idea, a good business and I can put my
[1:23:28] money and and I can have hundfold and
[1:23:31] stuff. You want a business to gain to
[1:23:34] gain it overnight. There's no such a
[1:23:36] thing, right? True.
[1:23:39] You don't make a candlestick
[1:23:43] overnight. It's made by hand, right?
[1:23:46] You're beating it day by day.
[1:23:50] You don't just walk up and to have all
[1:23:53] the knowledge, the the mysteries of God
[1:23:55] overnight.
[1:23:57] You sit down. You search the scripture.
[1:24:00] You read again and again. Yes, sir. At
[1:24:03] times it doesn't make sense. You leave
[1:24:05] it on a side. You come and you walk a
[1:24:07] little bit and you go, you pray, you
[1:24:09] pray, you come back, nothing comes back
[1:24:11] around
[1:24:12] yet. It doesn't reveal it. Has he hit me
[1:24:15] like it the other day? I said, "Look at
[1:24:18] how the Lord tells Abraham and
[1:24:21] say,"Abraham, I'll give you a
[1:24:23] child." God comes in human
[1:24:26] flesh and gives him the promise and said
[1:24:30] that you shall have a
[1:24:32] child. He had already lived with the
[1:24:35] woman for so many
[1:24:37] years and yet the revelation, the
[1:24:40] fulfillment of the scripture did not
[1:24:42] happen for another 25 years. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:46] how we go about life and we want it
[1:24:49] overnight.
[1:24:51] We want that revelation now. We want
[1:24:53] that preacher to preach what we want
[1:24:55] now.
[1:24:59] But God says look the
[1:25:02] principle. I give the promise.
[1:25:05] Abraham waited the father of what? Of
[1:25:09] faith believing him until the
[1:25:13] fulfillment of the prophecy. Amen. 25
[1:25:16] years. How much more, how many years
[1:25:19] have we preached to come to the
[1:25:22] conclusion that the message is
[1:25:25] wrong? How many years have we sat and
[1:25:28] waited upon that
[1:25:30] revelation to say that the message has
[1:25:33] mistakes in it?
[1:25:37] And when we believe that we have
[1:25:39] received the ministry of the son of
[1:25:43] man.
[1:25:45] Oh, if it's brother Brandham message
[1:25:48] that means that he can commit me he can
[1:25:52] make
[1:25:54] mistakes. That means that the God who is
[1:25:57] a perfect one will not receive us
[1:26:01] because this message has mistakes. Oh,
[1:26:04] God is himself is
[1:26:06] wrong because he can produce a prophet
[1:26:10] who can bring a perfect message
[1:26:12] according to our
[1:26:14] understanding. According to our
[1:26:19] imagination, where did that imagination
[1:26:22] come
[1:26:23] from? Our background,
[1:26:26] our science. That's why brother Vham
[1:26:29] says in the prayer line he said like you
[1:26:31] know devil you coming in the name of
[1:26:33] science in the t in the name of
[1:26:35] psychology but I'm meeting you in the
[1:26:38] name of the lord Jesus Christ. Amen. At
[1:26:40] times we're looking for the great
[1:26:42] deliverance in the physical form but the
[1:26:45] issue is in the mind. That's right.
[1:26:50] When people came in the line prayer line
[1:26:52] they said you know
[1:26:54] hey I can do it for you. It's your
[1:26:57] faith.
[1:26:59] When you come and you look at the one
[1:27:02] praying for you, preaching on the
[1:27:04] pulpit, it all dependent on your faith.
[1:27:07] Amen. Because when I look at the one on
[1:27:10] the pulpit and I'm doubting at it
[1:27:13] quickly, I am blocked. It did. The
[1:27:16] preacher didn't block me. I blocked
[1:27:18] myself. That's right. And nine time
[1:27:21] around nine time out of 10, it's not the
[1:27:24] preacher, it's me. Amen.
[1:27:28] I am doubting. Oh, he can't he can't lay
[1:27:30] on hands on me. He can't pray for me.
[1:27:33] Oh, I don't believe my husband. I don't
[1:27:35] leave believe my h my wife. Oh, I don't
[1:27:37] trust my children. The problem is not
[1:27:39] them.
[1:27:41] The problem is myself. Amen. A doubting
[1:27:44] spirit. Many times brother say like you
[1:27:47] know close your eyes. Look at that
[1:27:49] spirit of doubting is calling a a help
[1:27:52] in order to bring a little bit more of
[1:27:55] doubting in the woman. That's true. And
[1:27:58] if that ever comes to pass, then the
[1:28:01] rest of the church is caught up in the
[1:28:04] same spirit. Amen. But standing there
[1:28:08] with a with a child who couldn't have
[1:28:10] faith. He said, "Lord, look at this man.
[1:28:13] Look at this child." He says, "Sir, can
[1:28:15] you please close your eyes?" "No, I
[1:28:17] don't have to. It's my American right. I
[1:28:20] I'm entitled to do anything that I want.
[1:28:23] He said, "Lord, sir, once again,
[1:28:26] please." He won't
[1:28:28] listen. Then he he went to the higher
[1:28:31] court. He said, "Lord, you know this
[1:28:34] child, you cannot hold the healing of
[1:28:36] this child because of that man." Before
[1:28:38] he knows it, that spirit left the the
[1:28:41] one body goes into another.
[1:28:44] Aggression without
[1:28:46] expectation. Our mind is taken over. We
[1:28:50] are invaded by all kind of spirit, all
[1:28:53] kind of demons and all kind of things
[1:28:55] and we sitting in the church. We
[1:28:57] thinking about our job and
[1:29:00] our markets and
[1:29:02] our how the economy is going back and
[1:29:05] forth.
[1:29:07] Before you know it, the blessing of God
[1:29:09] comes by and just leaves us alone. Amen.
[1:29:13] Help us. Then day by day we walk around
[1:29:16] and ah my life doesn't change. I don't
[1:29:18] see really see anything. I'm looking for
[1:29:20] God. No, no, no, no. The problem is not
[1:29:22] God. That's right. He always shows up to
[1:29:26] all his appointments.
[1:29:28] He's here today. He's showing us the
[1:29:30] places that we're to focus in. Thank
[1:29:33] you. At times we're struggling here
[1:29:35] because our mind is so volatile.
[1:29:40] Easily we get invaded. We easily
[1:29:42] offended. We obviously get swayed by all
[1:29:45] kind of things.
[1:29:48] Oh my. A hidden life in Christ. He said,
[1:29:51] "I'll give you a new spirit." Now, that
[1:29:53] spirit isn't God's spirit. That's your
[1:29:56] spirit. God God gives you a new spirit.
[1:29:59] Then he says, "I'll put my spirit in
[1:30:02] him." But the thing God has to do is to
[1:30:05] give you a new spirit. make your nature
[1:30:09] a little bit more a little more gentle
[1:30:12] to settle down or it couldn't even live
[1:30:15] with you. Amen.
[1:30:19] To make you a little bit more
[1:30:22] gentle. The same brother Brandham that
[1:30:25] we
[1:30:25] know that was ready to take the gun and
[1:30:28] avenge his his dog. But then when the
[1:30:31] new spirit, not the Holy Ghost, when the
[1:30:33] new spirit comes
[1:30:35] in, all that is cast away.
[1:30:40] Now the same brother Brandham could go
[1:30:42] say, "Mr.
[1:30:44] Jesus, I've heard of you. Can you come?
[1:30:48] Let me talk to you." At times we don't
[1:30:51] pray enough because we don't have a new
[1:30:53] spirit. Amen.
[1:30:56] Because then your spirit will send you
[1:30:58] to your knees. because then your spirit
[1:31:01] is dependent of the Holy Ghost to come
[1:31:05] and be in touch with you. Amen.
[1:31:09] But then when we have all our
[1:31:11] psychology, all our mind, all our
[1:31:14] imagination standing up very
[1:31:20] expressive, explaining everything how
[1:31:23] Brandham did and the mistakes he did,
[1:31:25] how your wife is wrong back and forth
[1:31:28] and how the minister is not the one.
[1:31:37] gentle a little bit. Oh, he couldn't
[1:31:39] even live with you. So, he has to get
[1:31:41] you fixed up first before he come he can
[1:31:44] come in. I'll give you a new spirit.
[1:31:46] Then you take and then you take him
[1:31:50] anywhere you go. You you go all kinds of
[1:31:53] places. He's got to get you fixed up so
[1:31:56] you can re you can entertain him, right?
[1:32:02] infallible word of
[1:32:04] God. Like some people in being born of
[1:32:07] the uh like like some people in being
[1:32:10] born of the Holy Spirit of the Holy
[1:32:12] Spirit, they get messed up in the with
[1:32:14] the new spirit that Jeremiah said that
[1:32:16] God said that in the last day I'll write
[1:32:18] my spirit upon their heart. I write my
[1:32:20] laws in their hearts and I will give
[1:32:23] I'll give them a new spirit. I'll give
[1:32:25] them my spirit. And many people get the
[1:32:28] new spirit. You have to have the new
[1:32:31] spirit. You can't get along with your
[1:32:34] neighbor, let alone with God.
[1:32:40] That's why he says somewhere I believe
[1:32:42] uh where I think the the Pentecostal
[1:32:45] fell say like you know if I
[1:32:48] can't hold my brother that I can see
[1:32:52] and say my brother I love you how much
[1:32:56] more will it be with God? Amen.
[1:33:00] Just the same way I am with you here.
[1:33:04] Brother Mark, I love you. But it's just
[1:33:06] words.
[1:33:08] But if my actions toward Brother Marx is
[1:33:11] looking down at him,
[1:33:14] it's an intellectual faith.
[1:33:17] I look at my wife, I say, "My wife, I
[1:33:19] love you." But then around I go and I
[1:33:21] run with another woman. It's an
[1:33:23] intellectual faith.
[1:33:26] Amen. Then God say, "I have to give you
[1:33:29] a new spirit. First you get along with
[1:33:33] your neighbor." Amen. with people in the
[1:33:37] church desire to dwell with the people
[1:33:40] then now you can go God can come now and
[1:33:43] deal with
[1:33:44] you sometimes when you get the new
[1:33:47] spirit you think then that you've got
[1:33:49] the Holy Spirit but it isn't the new
[1:33:52] spirit the Holy Spirit will witness
[1:33:54] Jesus Christ but if you just join church
[1:33:57] went up and knew that you should do
[1:34:00] right that's just a new spirit
[1:34:06] You learn to do right. You learn to go
[1:34:08] to church. You learn that that that's a
[1:34:10] new spirit. It's good. But then there's
[1:34:12] another step. Amen.
[1:34:16] That's why when he preaches, go listen
[1:34:19] to those messages. Why? Where I think
[1:34:21] the Pentecostal has failed. Enticing
[1:34:24] spirit.
[1:34:25] Uh the greatest battle ever
[1:34:28] fought. He's not he's not just having
[1:34:32] church church conventions and church
[1:34:36] services. He's building us up
[1:34:40] so we can have an internal audit
[1:34:44] ourself. It's not always brother you did
[1:34:47] sister you did and he did there and you
[1:34:51] send an email back and forth. No, no,
[1:34:52] no, no,
[1:34:54] no. Take the time
[1:34:56] yourself. Do I care?
[1:35:00] Do I care?
[1:35:02] Am I building up the kingdom of God?
[1:35:07] How how is my ministry in the body of
[1:35:10] Christ helping the church rise up? Amen.
[1:35:14] Oh, I do. I just have a new spirit. I
[1:35:16] come to church and then God bless you.
[1:35:18] God bless you. And then you disappear
[1:35:21] and then we see you again on Sunday.
[1:35:26] But God, what a house will thy bill be?
[1:35:31] Because remember uh in the demonology
[1:35:34] physical realm, he says like, you know,
[1:35:36] I'm preaching these things because I've
[1:35:38] been on the field. I've seen these
[1:35:41] demons how they operate. And when you
[1:35:44] look at how the prophet was dealing with
[1:35:47] all those
[1:35:48] demons, those demons have found their
[1:35:51] way so easily in the church. I don't
[1:35:54] know if I'll be able to read the quote.
[1:35:56] He has find its way in the church in a
[1:35:59] very smooth way that it turns into
[1:36:03] culture.
[1:36:06] We become demonp
[1:36:08] possessed but we call it our cultures.
[1:36:12] That's right. If you remember when we
[1:36:14] spoke about Nimrod that that some demon
[1:36:17] who comes and turns, we call it our
[1:36:20] culture, my background, our homeman, we
[1:36:23] all those things we are just being
[1:36:26] invaded by demons.
[1:36:29] But this new spirit says like you know
[1:36:32] uh this will uh will uh will get us uh
[1:36:36] will get us somewhere there. I'll jump
[1:36:38] this here. We'll uh we'll try to to
[1:36:40] close up. But God's
[1:36:54] grace blind by
[1:36:56] terms. If any thought comes by
[1:36:59] 94 if any thoughts comes by well maybe
[1:37:03] you couldn't be so maybe it get it off
[1:37:07] your mind right quick.
[1:37:09] Think on think on the things that's
[1:37:12] positive. Never let a negative thought
[1:37:15] pass through. Just don't let it stop
[1:37:18] anyhow. If it starts through, keep your
[1:37:21] thought positive.
[1:37:24] Jesus.
[1:37:26] Like the old farmer said, I like this
[1:37:28] quotation. Blind B 96. He said like the
[1:37:31] old farmer said, "I can't keep the birds
[1:37:34] flying from all over my place, but he
[1:37:38] had a double barrel shotgun and said, "I
[1:37:42] can't I I can keep I can I I can show
[1:37:45] keep them from roosting." So you you do
[1:37:48] the same thing and you do to and you too
[1:37:52] see. Don't let them roost. Let them pass
[1:37:56] through right through on it. Amen. Now
[1:37:58] there's a shotgun to use. Both the Old
[1:38:02] and New Testament is a double barrel.
[1:38:06] It's very good too. That's right.
[1:38:10] Now our memory, our affections, our
[1:38:14] imagination, our
[1:38:16] conscious, we are now in placing the
[1:38:20] double bear gun in it. Amen. Amen.
[1:38:24] That's why we have to have our Bibles.
[1:38:27] That's why we have to read out the
[1:38:28] message every day.
[1:38:31] I might not understand it, but I'm
[1:38:32] reading it. When the thought comes like
[1:38:35] you know really you've been you've spent
[1:38:37] five years you haven't seen the the
[1:38:39] promise but but also it also said that
[1:38:43] uh what's his name? Abraham where the 25
[1:38:46] years I'm just spend five years. I can
[1:38:49] wait. Amen. It's now 25 years. Yeah.
[1:38:52] Yeah. Yeah. It's okay. You know, if God
[1:38:55] gives me more trial than Abraham, oh
[1:38:58] yeah, it is by his grace he trust me
[1:39:00] more.
[1:39:02] Amen.
[1:39:04] Until when the fulfillment of the
[1:39:07] prophecy
[1:39:09] comes then you'll be a testimony. That's
[1:39:13] right.
[1:39:14] Because in the entire Bible those these
[1:39:18] types and shadows it gives us the
[1:39:21] principles in the workplace everywhere
[1:39:23] that we are our mind the way we are
[1:39:26] shaping
[1:39:27] ourselves. Is it based on the message or
[1:39:31] is it based on with this books here that
[1:39:34] research shows that uh this demographic
[1:39:37] really we can't really rely on
[1:39:40] them. The problem is not the
[1:39:42] demographic. The problem is not the
[1:39:44] world. The problem is not the climate
[1:39:46] change. Oh, the the now climate change
[1:39:49] left and right. No, the problem is not
[1:39:51] God's earth.
[1:39:53] The problem is us. Amen. We've built all
[1:39:57] kind of things. We've turned into
[1:39:58] psychology. We've we've went into that
[1:40:01] deeper and deeper and deeper. We create
[1:40:03] the problem and now we we don't even
[1:40:05] have the time to consider that it's me
[1:40:07] who created the problem. Right?
[1:40:10] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, brother.
[1:40:12] Now, oh you this country, you have not
[1:40:14] to behave this way.
[1:40:20] No. Ephesians 4, be careful for nothing,
[1:40:24] but in everything by uh prayer and
[1:40:27] supplications with thanksgiving, let
[1:40:29] your request be be known unto God. And
[1:40:33] the peace of God which passes all
[1:40:36] understanding shall keep your heart and
[1:40:39] mind through Christ Jesus. Finally,
[1:40:43] brethren, whatsoever things are true,
[1:40:46] whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever
[1:40:49] things are just, whatsoever things are
[1:40:51] pure, whatsoever things are
[1:40:53] lovely, whatsoever things are of a good
[1:40:57] report, if there be any virtue and if
[1:41:01] there be any praise, what does the Bible
[1:41:03] says? Thanks.
[1:41:06] Amen.
[1:41:09] We have a good report from the Lord.
[1:41:12] Yes. We have a good message to think on.
[1:41:15] Amen. We have 1,200 tapes to listen to.
[1:41:19] That's right. If there be any virtue and
[1:41:23] the only thing that where there is life
[1:41:26] in this hour in this the message of the
[1:41:28] hour. That's right.
[1:41:31] We can choose to listen to movies and
[1:41:34] those who are making movies tomorrow
[1:41:36] they divorce they kill one another and
[1:41:38] all these things and what good report
[1:41:40] there is in
[1:41:44] I want to dress like them. I want to cut
[1:41:46] my hair like them. I want to look like
[1:41:47] this star here. I want to put the this
[1:41:50] extension left and right up and down the
[1:41:52] things. What good report there is into
[1:41:55] it. We find that a demon of doubting
[1:41:59] behind the problem is the person
[1:42:01] himself. But if there be any good
[1:42:04] report, if there's any message that can
[1:42:08] free us from all these things will give
[1:42:11] us the pathway to build this tabernacle
[1:42:14] that the Lord himself has will come and
[1:42:17] dwell. Amen. This tabernacle, what house
[1:42:21] will you build me?
[1:42:25] A house made out of a psychology,
[1:42:27] science and imagination of the world and
[1:42:30] conscious of the
[1:42:32] world. He gives us all the necessary
[1:42:35] tools. Amen. Thank you Lord. The ink is
[1:42:40] ours. The purpose are ours. He said take
[1:42:44] the ink. Take the paper. Take the Bible
[1:42:48] that we
[1:42:49] have. Read upon it day and night. Amen.
[1:42:54] listen to it over and over again.
[1:42:57] Even if the pastor doesn't preach it,
[1:42:59] listen to it.
[1:43:02] Even if the ministers are afraid to say
[1:43:04] certain things that are very hard,
[1:43:07] listen to it. Amen. That's why I'm
[1:43:09] recommending you listen to enticing
[1:43:13] spirit. Go listen to it. See how the
[1:43:16] prophet himself is opening his heart. He
[1:43:19] said like look at the time we are in.
[1:43:24] At times we are looking enticing spirits
[1:43:26] outside. No, no, no, no. Enticing
[1:43:27] spirits is here on the pulpit.
[1:43:31] Enticing spirit is not out
[1:43:34] there. By God's grace, we understand
[1:43:38] that these things are given unto us that
[1:43:42] when the Lord, if the Lord, if we follow
[1:43:44] the
[1:43:46] principles that God did in the in the
[1:43:49] wilderness with the children of Israel,
[1:43:51] he
[1:43:52] takes the program, he gives to the
[1:43:54] prophet, the prophet takes the program,
[1:43:57] he handers to the people, the people
[1:43:59] takes the program and they start working
[1:44:02] on it exactly according to
[1:44:06] We will have to have the same result as
[1:44:08] they did. That's right.
[1:44:12] If not, brotherham says what? There is
[1:44:14] something wrong somewhere. Amen. Not the
[1:44:18] word. That's right. As the musician
[1:44:21] comes, we
[1:44:23] close. This
[1:44:25] message, the greatest battle ever
[1:44:27] fought.
[1:44:29] As we are fighting this battle, it's not
[1:44:33] an easy one. Amen. And remember, the
[1:44:35] devil is not your friend. He's not
[1:44:37] somebody that you come about and uh and
[1:44:41] he will give you all the liberty for you
[1:44:43] to do everything and will let you pray
[1:44:46] as you like to pray. No, no, no, no,
[1:44:49] no. He will come. He knows you better
[1:44:52] than you know yourself. That's right.
[1:44:54] That's right. Let's be assured of it
[1:44:56] because that spirit that never dies was
[1:44:59] there from your parents and I ancestors
[1:45:02] and knows all your weaknesses and and
[1:45:05] all these things. And the only way
[1:45:07] brother Renham says is that double
[1:45:10] baragon. Amen. Very good. It's only the
[1:45:14] word. Even Jesus himself
[1:45:17] help to overcome with the same Bible.
[1:45:20] That's right. With the same scripture,
[1:45:22] right? It is written. It is written. But
[1:45:26] the word just shows us that it's not
[1:45:29] just an intellectual
[1:45:31] thing. You say one thing and your life
[1:45:35] have to cope with it.
[1:45:39] We say it, we believe it and let
[1:45:42] manifest it. Amen.
[1:45:45] Our dressing, our talking, our thoughts
[1:45:49] when nobody's looking.
[1:45:53] Let that sink in. Amen. Lord, let me not
[1:45:56] look to my brother. Let me look to
[1:45:58] myself.
[1:46:00] Because when I look into myself, I am
[1:46:02] finding more areas to fix as he told
[1:46:06] Abraham, I'm giving you the land. He get
[1:46:09] the land. He start walking in the land
[1:46:11] himself. Today he goes from Goshan. He
[1:46:15] goes to the next stage, Mam. He goes
[1:46:19] there. Oh, Job was buried here.
[1:46:22] Okay, here I have a a little bit issue
[1:46:26] of complex. Oh, I don't talk to that
[1:46:29] brother. I always avoid him. He's my
[1:46:32] brother. Let me go talk to
[1:46:34] him. I'm looking inside. Amen. Looking
[1:46:38] within
[1:46:40] with the double shotgun.
[1:46:42] We're looking in. We know surely that he
[1:46:46] who have started the promise, who told
[1:46:50] Abraham that your seed shall be slave in
[1:46:54] a foreign land, I'll bring them by my
[1:46:57] mighty hand. And this is the message.
[1:47:01] Amen. The mighty hand of God has come
[1:47:03] down today because the world are looking
[1:47:07] for the manifestation. But I can
[1:47:09] guarantee you when the manifestation
[1:47:11] will come about they will not believe
[1:47:13] it. They didn't believe it in Bradam's
[1:47:15] time. They didn't believe it in Jesus
[1:47:17] time. They call it
[1:47:19] [Music]
[1:47:21] telepathy. What will it be for us?
[1:47:25] In the humility that God will give us.
[1:47:27] Amen.
[1:47:29] Amen. May God bless you. Bless you.
[1:47:36] Let's all stand. In my life be
[1:47:41] glorified
[1:47:45] in
[1:47:48] my
[1:47:50] life.
[1:47:53] Lord be
[1:47:57] glorified. Oh be glorified.

[1:48:27] church.

[1:48:33] glorified. Oh be
[1:48:38] glorified
[1:48:40] in
[1:48:42] this church.

[1:48:51] glorified today in your
[1:48:53] [Music]
[1:48:55] bride.
[1:48:58] In
[1:49:00] your
[1:49:02] bride,
[1:49:04] Lord be glorified.
[1:49:09] Oh, be
[1:49:13] glorified
[1:49:15] in
[1:49:17] your
[1:49:19] right.
[1:49:21] Lord, be
[1:49:25] glorified. In my life, Lord, be
[1:49:28] glorified.
[1:49:31] Oh,
[1:49:32] in
[1:49:34] my
[1:49:36] life
[1:49:39] Lord be
[1:49:41] [Music]
[1:49:43] glorified. Oh be
[1:49:46] [Music]
[1:49:47] glorified
[1:49:49] in
[1:49:51] thine life.
[1:49:54] [Music]
[1:49:56] Lord be
[1:50:00] glorified
[1:50:01] today. Amen. Is that your desire
[1:50:04] tonight? Have him be glorified in you.
[1:50:08] Amen. You are my strength when I am
[1:50:11] weak. Amen. He's my all and all tonight.

[1:50:30] are the treasure that I seek. You are my
[1:50:35] all in
[1:50:39] [Music]
[1:50:41] all. Seeking you as a precious jewel.
[1:50:46] Lord, to give up, I'd be a fool. You are
[1:50:52] kind and
[1:50:56] all. Oh
[1:51:00] Jesus, you lamb of
[1:51:05] God.

[1:56:22] Father, it's been good to be in your
[1:56:23] house this evening. And Lord, truly
[1:56:26] there is none like you. Father, we thank

[1:56:30] lives. And Lord, we pray you would just
[1:56:33] strengthen Brother Martin and we thank
[1:56:35] you for the word that you brought
[1:56:36] through him tonight, Lord. We just dig
[1:56:40] deeper into you, Father. Lord, we ask
[1:56:42] that you would just come in our lives,
[1:56:43] Father. And have your way in each heart,
[1:56:46] Father. You know what each one of us
[1:56:48] have need of, Father. And may we just
[1:56:50] set aside the cares of this life, the
[1:56:52] things that might distract us, Lord. May
[1:56:54] we just press deeper into you, Lord, we
[1:56:56] pray. And be with us now this week.
[1:56:58] prayer continue to be with our pastor as

[1:57:07] with each one. Keep us safe on the
[1:57:08] roads. And until we meet again, Lord, we
