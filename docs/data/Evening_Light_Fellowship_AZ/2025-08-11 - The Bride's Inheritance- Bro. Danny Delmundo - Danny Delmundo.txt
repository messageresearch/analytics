Brother Russell has a song special for us now. Thank you for our song specialist today. &gt;&gt; Is this on then? Yeah. Let the blood of Calvary speak for me. If you're familiar with the song, you'll notice the words have been changed a little bit to make it more fitting to the bride. So, if you're wondering why it's a little different, can I read take this quote from the token? Also, the blood of Jesus Christ covers all of our sins and speaks peace and resurrection and power and life and healing and all the redemptive blessings that the blood was shed for, it speaks for us. Certainly. Certainly, the blood speaks. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] When the harvest has been gathered and all the work is done. When the last mile is traveled and this earthly race is run. When I'm called to that dimension just beyond this mortal sea, then let the blood of Calvary speak for me. [Music] May he write me down as righteous where no righteousness has been. shielding me from wrath and judgment as it covers all my sin. There's no work that I've accomplished, nor my goodness would I plead. Just let the blood of Calvary speak for me. [Music] There are friends that bring us comfort when they speak a word so kind. But their voicees are still temporal. in this the space of time. But there's a voice that calls for mercy ringing through eternity. Well, just let that voice of mercy speak for me. May he write me down as righteous where no righteousness has been shielding me from wrath and judgment as it covers all my sin. There's no work that I've accomplished nor my goodness would I plead. Just let the blood of Calvary speak for me. There's no work that I've accomplished, nor my goodness would I plead. Just let the blood of Calvary speak for me. [Music] Hallelujah Lord. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This will be our last Sunday till we come visit again. And I think I expressed a few words to you here a couple of weeks ago.

There will be people when we get over there that maybe you never heard of, never uh, you know, they weren't the big names. They didn't uh, but the unsung heroes that go to different places &gt;&gt; out of the way to just a few people. They get them baptized and and everything. And I believe that brother Danny is one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we're very very pleased to have our brother Danny here with us this morning. Let's stand. I'd like to sing a song this morning here as we change order of the service. Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra. You know in the Old Testament when the old patriarchs when God came down and met their needs, it was a supernatural event. And those men spake as God gave them utterance. And &gt;&gt; Abraham said, "I name this place Jehovah Gyra." &gt;&gt; Others said, "I name it Jehovah Raa. &gt;&gt; I hope uh this is Jehovah Shalom." &gt;&gt; Of the seven redemptive names of Elohim. Hallelujah. You think about it in those seven redemptive names. Whatever need that you have need of You call upon your creator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he'll give you a blessing from one of those seven redemptive names. You need peace, I'll give you shalom.

We need him. I need him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because without him, we cannot do anything. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Before anything else, I would like to thank brother Ron for uh having me uh treating me so very well all the time. And I always feel humbled to stand behind this pullpit. You know, I it's always in my heart. What should I preach? Amen. But uh we just we just we're just entirely dependent upon the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And with the little portion that the Lord has placed in my heart, I believe we'll also have a place in yours. &gt;&gt; So I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ from my little congregation back there in Metro Manila. Amen. And uh I'm missing uh uh B Mario and Sister Joe, but I'm seeing uh Sister Joby and Si here. Amen. Of course, my friend back there uh Bad Warren and his family. Amen.

Uh I saw a couple that crossed that uh that open door right there. See my I I saw brother Michaels and sister Wayet. Uh Amen. So I'm also scheduled to minister for them. Now I have another problem. I cannot preach what I will preach today. [Laughter] Amen. But yeah uh good morning and shalom. My wife Isabella Amen. Uh is also sending greetings uh to you sister Sunday. Uh amen. So we would like to read from uh the book of numbers. Amen. And numbers 27 we read from verse one and up to 11. Just bear with me. Amen. So it says here in chapter 27:E1, "Then came the daughters of Zilofiad, the son of Heper, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasse, of the families of Manasse, the son of Joseph. And these are the names of his daughters, Mahala, Noah, and Hogla, and Mila, and Tiraza. And they stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest and before the princes and all the congregation by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, "Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kora, but died in his own sin, and had no sons. Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family? Because he hath no son. Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father. And Moses brought their cause before the Lord. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, The daughters of Zilopiad speak right. Thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their fathers, brethren, and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. And if he have no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance unto his brethren. And if he has no brethren, then you shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren. And if his father have no brethren, then you shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it, and it shall be unto the children of Israel, a statute of judgment, as the Lord commanded Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord adds blessing to the reading of his word. Dear heavenly father, as we approach your throne of mercy this morning, we are entirely dependent upon you, Lord, we we need the substance of your word. It's your revelation that steers our faith, Lord God. And uh uh just anoint this uh uh mouth of lips, Lord, that uh uh that anything that would come out of it, Lord, will be a a little blessing to your bride here. So we thank you. We commit this service into your mighty hands in Jesus Christ's wonderful name. And everybody say amen this morning. Hallelujah. God bless you. You may now be seated. All right. Amen. So uh we would like to give a uh title on this message. The bride's inheritance. &gt;&gt; Claiming time. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believe it's claiming time? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So uh uh we are in the last part of this age that we are living in and uh uh the Lord has bestowed upon us. He has given us the full revelation of his word. And I believe that full revelation of his word place us in our rightful position and uh to be able to understand to be able to uh uh to know amen uh what is allotted for us in this generation. And I believe another point that uh uh by by by knowing our position, recognizing our inheritance, Amen. It takes the right attitude, the right character to be able to claim what really belongs to us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's why now in this uh uh part of the scripture, we will see that in Numbers 27:E1, let me just read it. It said, "Then came the daughters of Zilopiah, the son of Heper, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasse, of the families of Manasseh, the son of Joseph. And these are the names of his daughters, Mala, Noah, and Hogla, and Mila and Ta." Now notice that there had not been a time uh uh during this time uh uh it didn't happen that women claim inheritance that belong to their fathers. &gt;&gt; There was no record. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. when this happened. Uh because if we move backward, if we move in chapter 26 verse 54, to many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance, to everyone shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him, notwithstanding, the land shall be divided by lot, according to the names of the tribes of their fathers, they shall inherit. So the inheritance, Amen, are being uh h uh uh transferred or or or delegated being turned over. Amen. Uh h uh under one headship to to the other. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. No women, no women in the past, Amen. claimed inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. God bless you, brother Neil. Amen. So now we see here but at this point in time the very first time it happened amen that women claim inheritance. So they ask uh uh so that's why if we mention that that's why even in Joshua in chapter 17 verse3 uh Joshua mentioned these five women the daughters of Zilopiad and I believe Joshua had a reference in mentioning them. He said, "Now, but Zilopia, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasse, had no sons but daughters, and these are the names of his daughters, Mala and Noah, Hogla, Mila, and Tza." So Joshua mentioned these five women as an example. &gt;&gt; Amen. Joshua remembered these five women. Amen. Who stood their ground. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Realizing that their fathers had worked hard. Amen. To uh uh to have some some kind of properties and and and and and they they fully understood that uh uh their fathers wanted to uh uh to give something &gt;&gt; to his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it so happened that had no sons. &gt;&gt; No. All right. Now in the Bible, women are even very seldom being made mentioned unless there is a vital or a uh significant uh involvement. &gt;&gt; Now that's why in the uh in the Bible we we hear about uh uh Rahab, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. We uh in in in in Hebrews in chapter 11 we the all the heroes of faith the hall of fame in the Bible. Amen. In the Old Testament they were they were their names were written there. Amen. But you will see the name of Rahab &gt;&gt; there. &gt;&gt; Amen. You will see Sarah there. Amen. And and so uh these are names being mentioned because they fulfilled some significant uh uh uh roles. &gt;&gt; Amen. That would be a that would be an example uh something they have done something that is so monumental. Amen. That is worthy of being remembered. So I believe it's the same thing here that these five daughters of Zilopi had amen uh had been mentioned because they they uh uh they made something the change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Uh uh they were game changers. And I believe that's the same thing with the bride today. &gt;&gt; The bride is a game changer today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In this changing of dispensation. Amen. where we are stepping from you know uh from the age stepping into the into the blending our time into eternity. Amen. This is uh uh this is the meeting of two ages. &gt;&gt; All right. And the bride is here as a game changer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now we see here mentioned so we have we have hear about Eve. We have heard about Sarah Rahab. Amen. Uh there are only two books in the scriptures in the in in in the Bible. Amen. Named after women. We said we have Ruth and we have Esther. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we see in the books of Esther and Ruth. Amen. The great love story. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it speaks about the bride and the bridegroom. Hallelujah. When we remember Ruth, we know uh uh it is only composed of four chapters but it is so meaningful. Amen. We book about we read about Esther and we see how Amen. Uh Esther have changed uh uh uh uh uh the uh the natural course of uh of of of marriage you know and uh uh uh so it's the same thing in the church ages we come up at the conclusion time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this we have come into what we call the bride age. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in this bride age, when you realize you are the bride of Christ, you know who you are. &gt;&gt; You know what your position is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you know what you're claiming for. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's why you know there are there are five. And it it it is not uh uh uh a coincidence that they were five because in the New Testament in Matthew chapter 25 there are 10 virgins. Amen. And five of them are wise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I believe these five daughters of Celopead, they were &gt;&gt; wise. Amen. And so let me read my first quote. I know this is very uh uh very familiar, but let's be refreshed on this. Amen. The scripture Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts. Amen. So let me read that. Now remember this. Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; But the book of Revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it, &gt;&gt; making it lukewarm, formal, and powerless. Now remember the antichrist, amen, is no longer interested in the Roman Catholic Church. &gt;&gt; He's no longer interested in the denominational system. We are in the last days. &gt;&gt; I believe his focus now is here, right here in the message movement. &gt;&gt; He's trying to deceive the bride, the elect, &gt;&gt; if it's possible. &gt;&gt; But no, it's not. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we are in the word. &gt;&gt; We are part of the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the bride cannot be deceived. Amen. So we recognize the two spirits. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like when the seed was being thrown in the same field. Amen. Hallelujah. Now the two seeds are also in the same field &gt;&gt; called church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the bride that is so wise, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, can discern the spirit, &gt;&gt; can identify the spirit, hallelujah, because the word is able, it has a cutting ability, it can even divide even the soul and the spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now it says book uh uh it exposes Satan revealing his works, attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word. I know you're aware of that. &gt;&gt; They're trying to discredit the prophet in this generation. They try to discredit the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're trying to discredit the testimonies, but they're too late. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire, he fights that the message. He cannot stand it. &gt;&gt; He knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and she can do the greater works, she will be an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She will be and she is &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; an invincible army right now there is a bride &gt;&gt; hallelujah that knows who she is and what she is standing for &gt;&gt; that's why she cannot be defeated &gt;&gt; hallelujah because of the word &gt;&gt; hallelujah now another quote now we believe there must be a reason why we know who we are &gt;&gt; because we are being fed by the revealed word of the hour &gt;&gt; amen Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're feeding on the body word of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, in paragraph 166, in putting on the whole armor of God, the prophet said, "Now God fortified his army with what?" &gt;&gt; Himself. &gt;&gt; That's right, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. He fortified his army with himself, &gt;&gt; his person, &gt;&gt; his power, &gt;&gt; his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Through what he said, in the form of prophets, &gt;&gt; apostles, teachers, pastors, the five-fold ministry. Amen. He fortified his army with himself in the form of the five-fold ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what are these fivefold ministry? What was God doing? Listen, did you ever think what that offices of the church is? It's God's dress. &gt;&gt; The whole armor. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's God's dress. The five-fold ministry is God's dress. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And listen what verse it that it follows. Not just God's rest inside dress. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So we have dress but we still have inside dress. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that said God fortified his army his bride with the pip in the form of the pipled ministry. Amen. And the pipled ministry is God's inside dress. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why inside dress? Hallelujah. Because the inside dress is what touches the skin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He fortified his army with himself, the word &gt;&gt; through the pipled ministry. And this pipled ministry are experienced pipled ministry. They're being born again. They have an experience with the word. They are so tied with the word. The inside dress is what really touches the skin and they have personal experience with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't just you know pipled ministry is not just knowing the the scripture knowing the word memorizing all these quotes so and so on and you can name the message and you can even mention the page the paragraph and what title of the message is. Hallelujah. It's good but that's not all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible ministry must be exposed with the personal experiences with the word. It has personal touch of the skin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word being made blessed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is the kind of the ministry that will fortify his army, his bride. Amen. Hallelujah. And so now he said now he said for seeing it before Satan never gets to it. Dan told it what is it? God dressed up in his church. Now in his church, this offices is God's dress wear. When you see those offices, pastors, teachers, evangelists, what is that? That is God's dress, God's presence. &gt;&gt; God's spirit and working through men. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what brother said. Show me a church. Show me an individual. Hallelujah. That you can see Christ. And let me tell you once again that here on earth Christ is walking again in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now so this is what makes up the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now look at this. Daughters of Copiad in verse two numbers 27. And they stood before Moses and before Elizar the priest and before the princes and all the congregation by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation saying Moses brought their cost before the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saying speaking the word &gt;&gt; they speak their claim. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. They don't complain. They speak out their claim. &gt;&gt; And the good thing here, brother and sister, now listen in verse, they stood before Moses and Moses was the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In in in uh uh you you do it in a micro form. Moses was their pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. They know how to handle their claim. &gt;&gt; They know who to approach. &gt;&gt; They know where to go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They don't go from one house to another and speak out and complain on something. &gt;&gt; No. No. No. No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They did not approach any other minister. No, they they approached their pastor Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they stood before Moses and before Elizer the priest and before the princes and all the congregation by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. That's why Amen. the prophet of God encouraged us to have a home church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the place we go to. &gt;&gt; It's the place we support. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. With our presence, with our tithes and offering, that's where we go to. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is our family. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if ever we have problems, we we we don't go to some others. Amen. That's the time you feel you have a pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. So here neon they were they were five women daughters and I believe they were taught correctly by their father. &gt;&gt; Amen. And because they did the right thing, they approached the right person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were not refused. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And listen what in verse five, let's jump in verse five. Notice what Moses said. And Moses brought their cost before the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That all problems, you know, they're being brought. Amen. At the feet of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you know what? Moses had to take some time &gt;&gt; because Moses had no reference to that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; They presented their cause. They presented they were claiming something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it never happened before. &gt;&gt; But although it didn't happen before, Moses did not come into conclusion and rejected what these five women presented. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he said, "Amen. Let me speak to the Lord. Give me a little time. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't rush me. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Don't rush me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Give me time. It we we have no reference to that. But you know, I'll take some time. I'll pray about it. &gt;&gt; I speak to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And so that's why, you know, uh because they did the right thing. Amen. Uh uh they heard also the right thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh uh you know our pastor is not just a pastor in good times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He remains our pastor even in our hardest times &gt;&gt; in our worst moment of experience. &gt;&gt; There you have your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where the shepherd is. &gt;&gt; And said listen, wait a little bit. I pray about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because that's the way amen we should you know the the the prophet encourage us to love our pastors to support our pastor and that's why he encouraged us to have you know uh brother Bham made mention some he told the story about you know about a person uh there's another quote for that he said it's different when you're included in it yourself. So before brother Benham mentioned this, he he cited uh an illustration. He said, you know, sometimes the uh uh uh maybe a a pastor or and a deacon uh they go together, they talk and you know, the pastor said, you know, hey uh uh you see that you see that rushing river? Yeah. Yes, pastor. And the pastor said, "Do you believe I can cross on the other side although it's there's a strong uh rushing water?" And he said, "Yes, pastor. I believe you. You can do that." Okay. So, you see that little lag down there at the co at the side of the river? Yeah. You know, I can take that and you know, I can stand on top, sit on top of it and still cross on the other side. The p the deacon said, "Oh, sure you can do that." Amen. And you see that wheelbarrow? He said, "Now," he said, I said, "I can pack a log and wheel a wheelbarrow across at the same time." Sure, pastor. The Lord is with you. Your faith can do anything. He said, "Now I can put you in the wheelbarrow and pack the lag." He said, "Now wait a minute." &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So that's why said it's different when you're included in it yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's good when you're not part of it. You can do that. You can make it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But when you need to be identified, &gt;&gt; when you need to be part of it, when you should be included in it. See now that it's mighty good for us to say here, amen. It's mighty good for us to say, I believe that's true. But then put it in action. You got to put it in action. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whatever we believe, whatever we express, we need to put it into action. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Now on the next part we see here that uh in verse three we go back in verse three. Let's read in verse three. Now this is presenting now their claim. He said, "Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Kora, but died in his own sin and had no sons." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was the basis of their claim? The basis of their claim &gt;&gt; that put them in their rightful position &gt;&gt; was on the basis of the principle that their father remained faithful to Moses the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Our fathers have our father have no sons but we know amen we have a p we should have a portion on the inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what is their basis? What is their support? &gt;&gt; Amen. And they said our father died in the wilderness and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the lord in the company of kora. &gt;&gt; Amen. So remember these these individuals mentioned by these women daughters of Zilopiad. Amen. Were individuals who stood against Moses. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But because their father Zilopihad did not join them. &gt;&gt; Zilopiad was not a rebel against Moses. &gt;&gt; He stood with him no matter what. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; There were many many complaints against Moses and this uh uh uh uh uh group of Kora. Amen. They they stood against Moses and they were trying to circle around and convince so forth and so on. But Cilopia did not join them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he knew what's what what was going on. Amen. But Zilope had stood and because of his faithfulness I would say loyalty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know our loyalty is not vested upon men but because Moses was a vindicated prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our loyalty upon the vindicated man is our loyalty to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our respect to that person, our respect to that man is our also our respect and loyalty to God who pulled him and placed him. Hallelujah. So I believe that's why we have great respect for the messenger of this generation because the Bible says, Amen. He that receiveth the prophet in the name of the prophet shall receive the prophet's reward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so now listen. Amen. If we uh uh if we stand on that ground, amen, it will not only us who will benefit but our children also. &gt;&gt; Silopead was no longer on the scene. Amen. Only his daughters. Amen. And there were no one, no man standing for his daughters. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But his daughters are well thought. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and probably they could have seen how Zilopia had respected the prophet so much. Amen. And they have seen that and so that's why you know when when they know Amen. Now you know these are properties of our father. Amen. And and you know let's go we should go to court we should go where you know and let us let us uh appeal to some other families and probably they will they will help us present our our cause our issue so forth and so on. No, they did it themselves and approached Moses. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And because of that, they received Amen. They received the rightful response. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So look in the next quote, he said here now in paragraph 165 in the message, respects. Now if you can't respect the man, respect the office he holds in God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not just the prophet, the pastor, the fifold ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. Vindicated by the Lord and his word. That's exactly right. See, respect him. If a minister comes up, your pastor always respect him. I've heard congregations talk about their pastor. How just talk about him, run him down, ridicule him. How is that pastor ever going to do anything for you? He can't do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't say this church. Yeah. I don't say this church. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't say this church, but I mean churches I have seen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Meaning that was a prevailing fact during the time of the prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, you've got to love your pastor. And I believe you love your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can really feel it. And I that's that's something that uh uh uh uh good of you. Amen. Evening light f uh fellowship. You've got to know that's his human being. &gt;&gt; But yet God has made him &gt;&gt; listen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He &gt;&gt; pastor. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Did you get that? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; We pastors, we have our own weaknesses. &gt;&gt; That's true. That's a fact. &gt;&gt; We cannot deny it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But listen, I like this. The whole He said, you've got to know that he's human being, but yet God has made him his. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not ours. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; His &gt;&gt; pastor. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's not placed there &gt;&gt; just for something. &gt;&gt; He's pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's chosen pastor. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God's chosen ministry. The Holy Ghost has made him overseer. Then you've got to respect him in that manner. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And no matter what the pastor's done, if you'd respect him in your heart as God's servant, God will respect you for doing it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, that's how we respect the five-fold ministry. Of course, our pastor, the prophet of this generation in the five-fold ministry, because it's not it's not the man. Amen. It's the anointing in the man. &gt;&gt; It's the calling in the man. &gt;&gt; Because that made him his pipled ministry, not just the pastor. His. &gt;&gt; That's his. Very good. &gt;&gt; And if God claims the minister to be his, we're responsible to recognize that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And God will bless us in doing so. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, and of course, this is this example is also not new to you. I you know, uh during the time of during the time of Elisha, you know, in in second Kings, let me read that. So, the waters were healed. 2 Kings chapter 2 22. So the waters were healed unto this day according to the saying of Elisha which you spake. And he went up from tents unto Bethl. And as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him and said unto him, Go up, thou baldhead. Go up, thou baldhead. And he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And there came for two shebers out of the wood and tear 40 and2 children of them. Now listen, these are innocent children. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know the prophet of this generation spoke. Although he mentioned Elijah, we know that it was Elisha. He said he was baldheaded and he was coming down the road and some little children begin to say old baldheaded old baldheaded why don't you go up like Elijah did making fun of him now what was all right them little kids they didn't maybe it was their parents &gt;&gt; that taught them to do that &gt;&gt; they were little fellows &gt;&gt; you know but said you know it's no longer you know Yeah, we have h a children delinquency, but now it's not just children delinquency, but we have parent delinquency. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet moved further than that. Not just children parent delinquency, but also pulpit delinquency. &gt;&gt; Praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ministers stand behind the pullpit and yet they don't respect the word. Hallelujah. They can sing, they can worship, they can invite the presence of the Lord as if you're you're singing, you're worshiping along with the angels of heaven coming down to worship with you. Amen. You can see how they worship even in the denomination. They could they could pull down the presence of the Lord right there in their midst because you know, Amen. The the the prophet of God said when we invite him he will come. &gt;&gt; Amen. One time in the Bible Simon invited him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. He came. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But then we we we found out that he was invited there but he was not welcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. What do you call that? That's delinquency. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's home delinquency. You invite the Lord and then he's not welcome. He's just right there in one corner. not even uh uh uh uh paying attention to him, not even giving him water to wash his feet. Amen. Or if Simon was rich, he can he can assign he can pay somebody to do it for him. Hallelujah. No respect at all. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the same thing with many churches today. Amen. That way they they can really invite the presence of the Lord. They can enjoy, they can jump, they run and everything. Amen. But you know but when somebody stand behind the wolf he just say oh we don't need to preach the word anymore &gt;&gt; that worship is enough and the pastor will just preach you will just say something 5 10 minutes after worshiping one and a half hours &gt;&gt; no respect &gt;&gt; hallelujah worship is just cultivating the soil preparing the soil but unless you drop the seed &gt;&gt; there's nothing that will come out of that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So it's the same thing. That's why Amen. We we we we we now we we just feel the atmosphere when we worship, when we offer song with the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. Our hearts are being prepared. Hallelujah. Longing for something. Hallelujah. But we need the seed to be dropped on. &gt;&gt; We need the word. We need the message of the hour because the word will place us to our rightful position. Hallelujah. to our rightful attitude. It will produce right character. In that manner, we can claim &gt;&gt; our possession. &gt;&gt; We can claim our inheritance. Inheritance is just right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we need to approach it in the right manner. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see now Hallelujah. So you see now he said they were making fun of his prophet but they got him angry and he turned around and put a curse on them children in the name of the Lord and two shevers come out of the woods and killed 42 little innocent children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because probably during breakfast, during lunch, during dinner, Amen. they talk about the ministers and so forth and so on. and children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They make light of the ministry. &gt;&gt; And then you go on the next generation after generation. Look what we have right now in this generation. But thank God the message believers, we've got so much respect for the ministry. We've got respect for his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That's why here you know you can you can only in the message I can see even even in the Philippines you know even our young people hallelujah amen you know you preach one hour preach one hour and a half they have so much respect they can just sit down there and responding to the word hallelujah why because they are being well thought &gt;&gt; hallelujah thank you Lord &gt;&gt; and now that don't sound the nature of the holy spirit does it no kill them little children, but he angered a prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He cursed them. Children had to be recognized because he was a prophet. So you have to watch. Amen. Hallelujah. Now let's go on a bigger picture. So you see here from the home, the pullpit. Amen. So you see as as uh as we had made mention God's servants are human beings. &gt;&gt; Now I like that portion that says here even the prophet of God when I first read that and heard you know the prophet trying to commit suicide. Oh that shook me honestly. Amen. But in the message from that time on, brother B say I was just about to I had the pistol in my hand a few minutes before it snap it all the way around trying to commit suicide &gt;&gt; because of so much pressure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even the prophet of this generation express expounded by the Lord that he remains a human being. Amen. &gt;&gt; With so much stress, so much pressure, &gt;&gt; he went into that lowest level. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he tried and he said the same day I tried to lay my hand on the 33,000 volt line when I was working as an electrician. You know my story. And the first thing I know, I was on the ground sitting there sweating, not knowing what had happened. That meant God reserving this ministry for you people. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'd have went right then. &gt;&gt; So God had preserved the man. &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Oh I remember one time uh uh uh yeah it was I think it was brother Amos who messaged me that brother Ron was just walking and he just felt something and just you know and he was rushed to the hospital because of something that have happened. Something might have happened but the Lord preserved the man. God reserving this ministry for you people &gt;&gt; because we believe that unless we are finished with our ministry &gt;&gt; there's nothing Satan can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. He can just try us. He can just put us in one corner and pressure us. Amen. But unless we are finished, &gt;&gt; God will preserve &gt;&gt; God will preserve the man. Hallelujah. Now, so much on Moses, but let's now go back to the uh uh to the children to the daughters of Zilopiad and let's move forward and let's see in verse six. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe this is the main focus of my preaching this morning. In verse six, and the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, the Lord uh the daughters of Celopiad, listen, speak right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So who told that? The Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses had no reference. But now it's the Lord speaking back to him. &gt;&gt; He prayed about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Never rejected it because it did not happen before. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he said, "Can you give me a little time? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let me pray about it and let me just present it to the Lord and let's just wait." Because waiting is a virtue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you know how to wait in the right time, God will answer. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And so that's why in verse 16, and the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, hallelujah, the daughters of Zilopiad speak right. It is God who recognized the claim of the daughters. They are right. &gt;&gt; Yes, we have. You have no reference. Yes, it did not happen before. Yes, it's not in the book, &gt;&gt; but they speak right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because they know their position. &gt;&gt; They know their inheritance. They know how to claim it. They know where to go. They know who to go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so, it's God vindicating vindicating this this these daughters. Why? It's it's a good thing to hear. Hallelujah. That it's not any man who's vindicating our claim, but it's God from heaven. You are right. You speak right. You claim right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said, "The daughters of Cilopia speak right. Thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren. and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. It never happened before for the very first time now because there are five women who know who they were. &gt;&gt; They knew their father was not a rebel. &gt;&gt; He did not join among the company of &gt;&gt; Kora. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That was only the backup, the support that they had. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And it is all coming from the mouth of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Speaking to Moses, the daughters of Zilopia speak right. Thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their brothers, brethren, and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. Hallelujah. Amen. So you see, you remember sister hate, right? &gt;&gt; Brother Bannon was testifying and perhaps there were there were men around that you know they're they're just listening, you know, nodding their heads like that. Amen. But there is a woman, Amen. There is a little old quiet sister sitting back there, a little dash bonnet on like the country women wear there. And she put a little clean bless to come over to help her mother cook me a dinner. And she was sitting with her hand like this and she said, "That's nothing but the truth." &gt;&gt; That's nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; She said the right thing. &gt;&gt; She said the right thing. He said, "Here's my Bible." And as a servant of God, I say this. I could hear hardly hear the last she said. Her mother was trying to say something, but I didn't get it. Just as she said, she said the right thing. The spirit of the Lord said to me, tell her, &gt;&gt; tell her, &gt;&gt; tell her to ask what she will &gt;&gt; and you give it to her. Amen. It's the same thing, same pattern. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because the woman, sister hat, right? Hallelujah. She said the right thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; While others might have doubted &gt;&gt; the testimony of the prophet, but here comes an old poor woman. Hallelujah. Amen. Who had nothing, &gt;&gt; but she said the right thing. Hallelujah. Here's my Bible. And as a servant of God, I say this. I could hardly hear the last she said. Her mother was trying to say something, but I didn't get it. Just as she said, she said the writing of the spirit of the Lord said to me, tell her to ask what she will and you give it to her. Moses, give the daughters of Zilopiad &gt;&gt; what they are claiming for. &gt;&gt; Because they said the right thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just don't know how far it can go when we say the right thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And said I couldn't speak that room everybody felt strain. I said sister she said yes brother Brennham &gt;&gt; I said thus saith the Lord &gt;&gt; speak anything that you desire. &gt;&gt; I don't care what it is. If you want to know what God has given this ministry speak anything that you desire. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe there's there's Haiti here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The bride is here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You speak anything that you desire. I don't care what it is. If you want to know that God has given this ministry, speak anything that you desire. Thus say the Lord. If you'll speak it, I'll speak it behind you and you'll have it right here. &gt;&gt; Right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Eight people standing there looking. She said, "Brother Brennham, what shall I say?" &gt;&gt; So innocent, &gt;&gt; just saying the right thing. And I said, I said, "It's up to you. &gt;&gt; Up to you. &gt;&gt; It's up to you." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham gave him gave her options. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here are the options. There set her crippled sister, her aged father. She was poor. She could ask for money. &gt;&gt; She could have asked for anything she wanted to. &gt;&gt; I said, "Ask anything that's in your heart." &gt;&gt; Anything that you want to, you ask it. And thus, say the Lord, I'll speak it behind you and you'll have it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Two options. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Money or healing. But you know a woman a a woman is the bride &gt;&gt; but the bride who is in her rightful position &gt;&gt; who has the character &gt;&gt; knows what is more valuable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I I'm not saying brother Brandham was giving him giving her a wrong option. Hallelujah. That's not it. But I believe at that very moment, Sister Haiti, right, was in the rightful position and she knew what was more valuable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Something that is not only tangible, but something that is eternal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If we know what to ask from the Lord, we know what is valuable. Not something that is temporal but something that is eternal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then Hallelujah. And then and she said the salvation of my two boys. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said I said you have it in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Others might be questioning. Amen. Hallelujah. About those two boys. But then and again just like the daughters of Zilopia had that it did not happen before. &gt;&gt; Never in the history of men. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Never in the history of salvation. Brothers and sisters only by this occasion. Hallelujah. That the basis of the salvation was not after the conversion of those two souls but after the claim of their mother. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe God is absolute. &gt;&gt; I believe God is absolute. &gt;&gt; I cannot question that &gt;&gt; because it is thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I believe the prophet and he that receiveth the prophet in the name of the prophet shall receive the prophet's reward. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. Amen. Come on, bride. Speak. speak the right thing. Hallelujah. And those two little modern teenage nickel preach boys that had hated the very cause of Christ grabbed one another and begin to scream. And the blessings of God, the power of God struck the place. Bangs fell into this plate. I don't know what happened for about 10 minutes. Friend, do you realize what that was? &gt;&gt; I have never in all my life. &gt;&gt; It never happened before. &gt;&gt; Amen. Word. &gt;&gt; You might have something to pray. &gt;&gt; You might have a claim. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That you have not experienced before. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, speak the right thing. &gt;&gt; And speak something that is more valuable. &gt;&gt; God is here. &gt;&gt; I have never in all my life have felt such anointing. The first time I was ever perform on a human being, it bypassed aristocrats. It bypassed everything else and went to a poor little old widow woman living up on the hill there. God knew what she would ask. &gt;&gt; God knew what she would ask. Her two boys were gloriously saved the very minute it was spoken. If she would have asked for $10,000, it would have been given to her. &gt;&gt; Thus said the Lord. If she would have asked for her sister's healing, it would have been given to her. Anything she would have asked, it would have been given to her. &gt;&gt; And now listen, this is for you. This is for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now listen, what's the next verse? &gt;&gt; I believe &gt;&gt; that the church of the living God &gt;&gt; Amen. If the brother can help me, I want everybody to to to read this. Amen. I believe that the church of the living God is moving into a spear now &gt;&gt; that's going to shake the whole world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that the church of the living God is moving into a spear now that's going to shake the whole world. That's the first time it's been since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a human being. Ask anything that you will and it shall be given unto you anything you desire. Don't you see the words of Jesus Christ being fulfilled? &gt;&gt; We are entering into that spear &gt;&gt; now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Into that real now. &gt;&gt; I believe this message is continuously unfolding itself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. for us to be able to comprehend. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What's in this word, what's in this message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's hard for us to faith them. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; But this is real. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; God is real in our midst. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're entering now. We have entered actually now into that sphere where everything is possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now moving on on numbers chapter 36:E2. Amen. Numbers 36:2 or before. Yeah. Yeah. And they said, "The Lord commanded my Lord to give the land of an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel Israel. And my Lord was commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Cilopad, our brother unto his daughters." Amen. So in chapter 36 of Numbers, it was again mentioned and declared. All right. Now, let's go back to Numbers chapter 27 and we're going to see something here. Amen. In verse 8, Numbers 27 verse 8. Oh, I like this. You like the word of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Now, it first time it happened. Hallelujah. Now in verse 8 of Numbers chapter 27, it says here, "And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, "If a man die and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. And if he has no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren." Did you see something here? Yes, &gt;&gt; it never happened before. &gt;&gt; No record on file. &gt;&gt; But yet because of the five daughters of Zilopiad saying the writing, claiming the writing, knowing what's valuable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now God made a declaration. &gt;&gt; Now it is not put on record, &gt;&gt; but let it be recorded from this time on Moses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let it be. Amen. And he said, "Now, Amen. He speak unto the children of Israel, saying, if a man die and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter." &gt;&gt; The game is changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God who was absolute was being convinced &gt;&gt; by the position of these women. &gt;&gt; I wonder this morning. Hallelujah. Amen. I believe that I'm facing today. Amen. The bride of the Lord Jesus Christ who knows &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; What it is? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what she is standing for. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now maybe last few more coach here. No. Yes, sir. The church now we're moving into that spirit now in the church age book. Listen. Yes, sir. The church is no longer the mouthpiece of God. &gt;&gt; It is its own mouthpiece. &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you see the situation the prophet is here right say whatever you desire in your heart &gt;&gt; and sister hat said brother Brandham I don't know what to say can you say it for me &gt;&gt; because she had so much confidence on the prophet &gt;&gt; but the prophet recognized the word the voice of God &gt;&gt; and said no that's not the instruction instruction. &gt;&gt; The instruction was say what that woman desires. &gt;&gt; And Bel gave her an option. &gt;&gt; So say whatever you wish. &gt;&gt; Amen. So listen here. Now the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God. It is its own mouthpiece. &gt;&gt; So God is turning on her. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet basically is no longer on the scene. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we have the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you know your rightful position. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So God the pro the Bible of God is turning on her from the prophet to the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not me. Sister hate. Right. You &gt;&gt; have to speak. Right. &gt;&gt; God is turning on her. God from the prophet is turning on to the bride. &gt;&gt; Come on, bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is turning on you. God is turning on us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To speak. &gt;&gt; No longer the mouthpiece of God. You but you are the bride is her own mouthpiece. &gt;&gt; He will confound her through the prophet and the bride. For the voice of God will be in her. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. For it says in the last chapter of Revelation verse 17, the spirit and the bride say come and once more the world will hear direct from God as a Pentecost. But of course that word bride will be repugated as in the first age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. God is turning on her. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is standing on the bride. &gt;&gt; The word, the voice is in her. &gt;&gt; To have confidence. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So that's why God has given us all this inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so you see, we have mentioned Rahab. We have mentioned, you know, uh but I'm going to to read uh in John 11:1. Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. Therefore his sister sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. When Jesus heard that, he said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby." Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. Now I made mention this because you know at one occasion Mary and Martha Jesus was there and Jesus reminded Martha Martha you're thinking so much &gt;&gt; you're making yourself so busy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you see you're doing good &gt;&gt; but you're complaining. Yeah. You're you're serving God's people while I'm preaching here. Amen. You're preparing food. You're preparing all these things that so that after the fellowship, we have something to eat. That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. But what made it bad is you're complaining. &gt;&gt; When we do something for God, don't complain. &gt;&gt; Do it as unto the Lord and let his his name be glorified. &gt;&gt; Amen. But look at Mary. He had chosen the best part. &gt;&gt; Amen. And also not only that, this this part of the scripture reminded Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wipe his feet with her hair. Amen. But listen, what I'm after this this part of the scripture is that God never forgets. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we cannot outdo God. &gt;&gt; We cannot even outgive him. And whatever we do, no matter how little, how how big it is, it is recorded in the mind of God. Maybe other people won't see it, but nothing will escape from the sight of the Lord. It's all recorded. And from a certain period of time, God knows how to repay. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And what happened? What have they witnessed? The resurrection of their brother. &gt;&gt; The resurrection of their brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Now, I'm closing in. Now, in numbers 27, let's go back in verse one. It says, "Then came the daughters of Zilopead, the son of Happer, which means well, the youngest son of Gilead, Makir and Manasse, and Joseph." This the lineage of Zilopiad from Zilopiad. He said, "Callopiad, the son of Heer, son of Gilead, Amen, the son of Makir, son of Manasse, and son of Joseph." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So that's the lineage of Cilopad. &gt;&gt; All right. So now Joseph, if we look at Joseph and we can find that in Genesis chapter 48, but we might not be we don't need to read that. You can read that back home and review it. I'm I'm going to read a portion of the quote. Now here in Genesis 48, Israel, Jacob was very old and his eyes were dim. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like the same thing, we are already in the last age and it looks like the light is dim to others. &gt;&gt; Amen. But not to the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So those who are reading this part of the scripture, you know that in Genesis chapter 48, because Israel was so old, Joseph brought his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. &gt;&gt; And Ephraim by principle was older than Manasse. And it's a custom that that the elder gets the blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Gets the inheritance. And again it happened at this point of time. So now Joseph knowing the tradition probably knowing what have transpired for long long ages before. Amen. So he knew that his father will put the blessing to the elder. So here is Israel. In his right hand he placed Ephraim. Amen. And then on his left he placed Manasse. &gt;&gt; All right. So now when Israel was about to pray, he crossed his hand. &gt;&gt; He crossed his hand. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Joseph wanted to correct the prophet. &gt;&gt; But you cannot do that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he said, "Father, that's not it. This is Ephraim. He's already on your right side and on your left is Manasse." &gt;&gt; Amen. Israel said, "I know what I'm doing." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know what I'm doing. And brother Brandham said, "God has crossed my hand." He said, "God has crossed my hand. It's not me. God has crossed my hand because God has chosen that the younger shall receive the blessing." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Now let's go to the conclusion. Now, now the Cilopia now listen the meaning of the names of the five daughters of Zilopia in regard to the names of the daughters scholars largely in agreement. Mahala means forgiven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mala means forgiven. &gt;&gt; And it's even placed in its rightful order. &gt;&gt; You know, because before you go into service, you must be forgiven first. Amen. &gt;&gt; But aren't you glad we're not just forgiven, we're being justified. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; More than just being forgiven. So mala means forgiven. But mala today means justified. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what have you felt after you were you felt you're being justified. Oh, hallelujah. You are being revived. You are being you've been rejoicing. &gt;&gt; There's a revival &gt;&gt; in your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's why the name Amen. Mala means forgiven, justified. Noah means movement. And movement is like a revival. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's placed there. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Not the Noah the pro but is the daughter of Zilopiad named Noah. Amen. His her name means a revival. &gt;&gt; So after being justified there is a revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then next, Amen. The name Mila means queen. &gt;&gt; Milka means queen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; To him that overcome will I give to sit with me in my throne. &gt;&gt; Where is the bride sitting? Beside &gt;&gt; Ruth, Esther. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And because you are the bride, tearsa means pleasing, &gt;&gt; an apple of the eye, &gt;&gt; favorite. &gt;&gt; And lastly, amen. Hogla means worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So all these characteristics are being combined. Hallelujah. and being uh uh being absorbed by the bride of this age today. Hallelujah. We feel we're being justified as if we have not done it in the first place. God had thrown it in the sea of God's forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why there is an in an inner revival because of the word and we know our position will be sitting with her in his in in him in his throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. and thus give us a reason to worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what is our rightful inheritance? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brennan, when he was beyond the curtain of time, I'll just going to close my notes. So I just leave it just right there. I know our pastor can give a further conclusion on this. But you know when brother Brandham was beyond placing beyond the curtain of time you know you know there was a voice and and he saw a lot of people and said are all these panels we're not that many and know they are your converts. Amen. But you see up here now I just remember this one because as I flew here my uh uh uh my kids they had dogs and they're quite old. They had three poodles and one of them uh just had uh a surgery and my youngest daughter Faith just finished her veterinary medicine and uh preparing for her examination. But anyway, now one one of the the poodles and that's her favorite got sick had the surgery they spend a little because they wanted to extend and then just few days when I came here. Amen. My my daughter prayed you know and I I I knew I felt being a father she was crying because I know how she loved it. Amen. That's why I want to close with this. And so when when uh uh uh brother Benham heard the voice and he said at one point in time, you know, he remember uh his dog Fritz and his horde horse prince and even his rocking chair. Amen. And and he said when when when they were in that condition, Amen. Brother Banam said, you know, I know there's a place somehow that I'm go. I want to see you preach and prince. Amen. And so I copy and paste this portion and send it to my to my daughter. Amen. That when we go on the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All those who loved us &gt;&gt; and those that we love. &gt;&gt; What are those creatures doing there? But see, they're part of our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and and and brother Benham said, "Will also Paul stand behind or uh in front of his people?" Yeah. He said, "Well, brother Benham said, I Paul I preach what Paul preached." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I have never deviated from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I never changed. I have never rebelled against the word of Paul. And we're resting on that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a resounding voice, a multitude of people, we're resting on that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Those that whom you love and have loved you &gt;&gt; will be there. They are yours. Amen. &gt;&gt; They're your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. Thank you, brother. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I love Bible stories. &gt;&gt; I love looking into another portion I've not seen before. &gt;&gt; Did you see something new? &gt;&gt; I will &gt;&gt; never read Numbers 27 &gt;&gt; the same again. because however you say his name or whatever it is because he did not rebel. He was not part of Kora. They had a right because they knew their father was rightfully taught. So they coming under that same thing. He taught us what he knew. He taught us. &gt;&gt; And this is amazing that they said we want our father's inheritance. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; never before &gt;&gt; because it was always passed down through the sons &gt;&gt; and through the elders. &gt;&gt; But God knows how to cross hands. &gt;&gt; God knows how to do things at the right time. And he cannot deny his own word. And they were a part of their father and their father had an inheritance. And because he was of the lineage of [Applause] &gt;&gt; the inheritance coming down &gt;&gt; through Joseph. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I was so glad that because I said, "Lord, I know that the daughter's names mean something." &gt;&gt; I thought when I get home, I'm going to study the names. And there he told me their names. &gt;&gt; And in their birth order, &gt;&gt; what about your birth order? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; How that you come, you're forgiven. &gt;&gt; You're justified as though you've never done it. [Music] &gt;&gt; I like to be stirred. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Noah means revival. &gt;&gt; Mila means queen. &gt;&gt; Knowing her position. &gt;&gt; Then he says, "Look, look at Esther and Ruth." &gt;&gt; Knowing their position. Where was it? Beside him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I perish, I perish. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Never before in the history did you go before the king unless you were asked to come before him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here's another first time game changer. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Esther comes &gt;&gt; with something on her heart and it's the salvation of her family. [Music] What do you want, Esther? [Music] &gt;&gt; Up to half of my kingdom. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. &gt;&gt; You begin to see these types and shadows. &gt;&gt; TZ means the apple of my eye, my favorite. I have not chosen you, my people, because you are the most in number, but I have chosen you because you are the fewest. I have elected you, predestinated you. You were in the mind of God. I conceived you before works were even done, before you were even born, before you went and lived your life. Before anything happened, I have already declared, &gt;&gt; you're the apple of my eye. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You're my favorite. Amen. &gt;&gt; The last one, Haggala. &gt;&gt; Worship. &gt;&gt; My I I enjoyed that. &gt;&gt; I know you're not supposed to steal things. I'm going to steal that one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I love to see the unfolding &gt;&gt; of the word here. Five daughters. There was no son, &gt;&gt; but they they knowing they've been taught, right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, what about my father's inheritance? &gt;&gt; And I like to they went to the right channel. [Music] They go to God's provided way. They go they know the the the the approach to God. &gt;&gt; They knew God's dressear. &gt;&gt; Are you catching it? &gt;&gt; They knew if I if I go and I touch God's dressear per adventure. It's never been spoken before. This has never come to pass. But I want my inheritance. I don't care what it takes. I want what belongs to me. [Music] &gt;&gt; How many of you say, "I want my father's inheritance." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know I don't deserve it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's not about me. It's about him. &gt;&gt; Not about you. It's not. It's about the seed that lays within you. And God cannot deny himself. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, another piece of the puzzle just fell together &gt;&gt; and my heart is blended even that much more closer to him. Father, I look and I see these five daughters come claiming their inheritance. And God said, and they speak, right? &gt;&gt; Imagine God, he didn't come down and give to them, speak to them in the night dreams and everything. No, he spoke to the prophet and the prophet spoke to them. God has heard your word and you spoke right. &gt;&gt; If you'll speak right, bride, &gt;&gt; it's not you. When God comes down and and he anoints you, even though you're a human element, he said when the divine omnipotence of God comes down and reveals to you your inheritance, it's the same as omnipotence speaking. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm feeling rising to another level. Come on. &gt;&gt; He said, "We've entered another sphere, another realm." &gt;&gt; Enoch was entering into another realm. &gt;&gt; The bride is entering now. &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; This partial revelation is becoming full &gt;&gt; revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Danny, [Music] &gt;&gt; the Lord bless you. Bless your ministry. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ain't that ain't that good? &gt;&gt; Let's believe together. &gt;&gt; Let's agree together. Because whatsoever you bind on earth, &gt;&gt; I'll bind it in heaven. It's omnipotence in you. It's God speaking. Amen. Brother Robert, here. Give me your hand. Let's agree together. &gt;&gt; Give me your hand. Let's agree together [Music] that all of our eneies will crumble at our fear. Whatever we bind on earth will bow in heaven at the name of Jesus. Satan has to flee. &gt;&gt; We got the power. We got the power in the name of Jesus. We got the power in the name of the Lord. All those things [Music] we will not be on the power in the name of the Lord for many years now try to stop us by the bride of Jesus. Lord still alive. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we're still here.

All those things [Music] we will not be here. Take the town in the name of the Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've heard a good word this morning. And he said, and there at the end, the spirit and the bride say, "Come." Blessing. Come, Lord Jesus. Come. That should be on every one of our hearts this morning. Come, Lord Jesus. Come Justin, if you'll help us sing this this morning. May this be your heart's cry. Ruth had a cry on her heart. Esther had a cry on her heart. The bride of Jesus has a cry on their heart.
