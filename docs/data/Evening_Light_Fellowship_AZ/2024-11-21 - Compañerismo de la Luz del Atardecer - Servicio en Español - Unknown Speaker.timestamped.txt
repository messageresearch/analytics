[36:23] y una un
[36:25] candelero y y sabemos que el candelero
[36:28] es el misterio de las siete edades y
[36:31] supo que este hombre pudo darnos algo
[36:34] que necesitamos y
[36:37] ella ella no más no se acercó con ese
[36:40] entendimiento que una bendición o quizás
[36:44] déjame tener esto déjame tener lo demás
[36:46] no ella primero tuvo un deseo que que
[36:50] quería saber qué es lo que él tenía
[36:52] porque en esta
[36:53] hora sabemos que vemos por la aparencias
[36:58] y
[36:59] y vemos la aparencia que es bien fuerte
[37:02] o tiene buen trabajo Déjame ver su Ah lo
[37:06] que ha hecho su su crédito y la mujer No
[37:10] ella no vio eso ella Esa mujer entendió
[37:14] el programa de Dios y ella dijo y cayó
[37:19] en un día que él se acercó y él entró y
[37:23] aceptó la
[37:24] invitación porque Jesús siempre cumple
[37:27] todos sus
[37:29] citas y luego dijo qué pasa hermanos por
[37:33] ella y dice respondió y estamos viendo
[37:37] las cosas que estamos viendo estamos
[37:39] interesados en eh nosotros tenemos que
[37:42] estar interesados en él y dice que tú te
[37:45] acercas a él él te acerca a ti y la
[37:48] mujer comenzó a ver la profeta comenzó a
[37:51] ver y decir qué es su
[37:54] problema qué podemos hacer por ella
[37:58] está haciendo todos estos trabajos qué
[37:59] podemos hacer por
[38:02] ella y luego dijo enre dijo él Entonces
[38:05] al guis dile que aquí tú has estado
[38:09] solicita por nosotros con todo
[38:13] este
[38:14] esmero qué quieres que haga por ti
[38:17] necesitas que hable por ti al rey o
[38:20] general del ejército y ella respondió yo
[38:24] habito en medio de mi pueblo
[38:29] y él dijo qué pues haremos por ella y
[38:32] gis respondió he aquí que ella no tiene
[38:36] hijo y su marido es
[38:39] viejo Entonces esto lleva para atrás en
[38:42] este en la mismo escenario que una mujer
[38:46] que no puede tener hijos en el tipo de
[38:48] visitación porque ella entendió que esta
[38:51] es la hora de nuestra visitación que
[38:54] este hombre de Dios no n más es una
[38:57] persona natural pero
[39:00] este es un ángel de Dios es es un ángel
[39:04] de Dios que no nada más viene para para
[39:08] pasar aquí o comer pan o o colectar
[39:12] diezmos no vino a la mesa y vino ahí al
[39:16] cendero ahí a la cama y y todas estas
[39:20] cosas estamos poniendo el altar ahí
[39:23] adentro de la casa y esta hora que está
[39:26] de la iglesia del del Cristo viviente es
[39:29] un tabernáculo que el altar y los
[39:32] calendarios y todo esto a la arca de de
[39:36] de
[39:37] arca y ella tuent tuvo esto yo necesito
[39:41] traer este hombre para acá porque no
[39:43] está viendo un hombre está está
[39:46] discerniendo el cuerpo de Cristo
[39:48] entendiendo el ministro de del hijo de
[39:50] Dios en esta edad o esta hora de
[39:53] visitación ahí acuerdo a la propósito
[39:57] que ella sabía el programa de la Biblia
[40:00] ella ten sabía que para tener un hijo
[40:03] ella no n más trajo el problema al
[40:06] hombre de Dios dice primero hay Hay que
[40:09] crear y construir el altar primero
[40:12] después que ella hizo el altar ahora
[40:15] podemos tener un acceso al rey de reyes
[40:19] y cuando nosotros llegamos allí él tiene
[40:22] que por su palabra tiene que cumplir Y
[40:26] entonces qué es tu
[40:28] problema Yo vivo aquí entre mi gente yo
[40:31] voy a la iglesia Yo veo que tú pagas los
[40:36] diezmos y todo pero qué es tu
[40:39] problema la profeta dijo Oh no tiene un
[40:43] hijo no hay allí
[40:46] algo no hay continuidad de vida el
[40:50] hombre es Ya está
[40:51] viejo y ya no tiene placer ya más
[40:55] entonces dice
[40:57] Llámala a ella dice ven para acá y viene
[41:01] aquí a línea de la oración y cuando ella
[41:03] la llamó
[41:06] a y dice que y él dijo en el año que
[41:10] viene por esto tiempo abrazará un
[41:14] hijo
[41:16] y y cuando la visitación vino pero en
[41:20] ese tiempo era un cuerpo hecho por la
[41:24] tierra el polvo pero en esta hora
[41:28] fue un
[41:29] hombre nacido de un hombre de una mujer
[41:32] y tiene que cubrir este con un velo este
[41:36] Dios y este Dios que no se miraba no se
[41:40] no se oía este Dios que estaba caminando
[41:43] por allí por los candeleros Ah por allí
[41:47] por los candeleros
[41:49] este fue visto por Juan caminando por
[41:53] todo y al último dice yo voy a ver mi mi
[41:58] grado porque el
[42:01] promesa no viene adelante no s adelante
[42:04] la palabra Si no cumple el propósito
[42:07] para qué fue enviado y la palabra fue
[42:10] adelante y y acordando la tiempo de la
[42:14] vida y por ella poder llegar en ese
[42:17] tiempo de vida el hombre tenía que ser
[42:20] joven otra vez Tiene que ser un cambio
[42:24] de cuerpo para poder preparar para que
[42:26] es semilla puede salir en ese cuerpo y
[42:30] cuando Esa esa semilla va ahí al cuerpo
[42:33] entonces la palabra tiene que llegar a
[42:36] manifestación y ella estaba ahí parado
[42:39] en ese tiempo de visitación muy muy
[42:41] presente lo que Dios estaba proclamando
[42:44] por su
[42:45] vida y acordando como vemos aquí vemos
[42:49] en el primer servicio de antes nosotros
[42:52] nos quedamos atrás abajo del Ministerio
[42:55] de
[42:56] Eliseo no abajo de una dominación no
[42:59] estamos tratando nuestras propias ideas
[43:03] pero estamos preocupados por como el
[43:07] profeta
[43:08] habló Jesús vino y murió en la cruz pero
[43:12] es no fue Fue
[43:14] suficiente porque Jesús pagó el precio
[43:18] después que él pagó el precio él
[43:19] requirió reclamar el premio Y para
[43:23] reclamar ahora Necesitamos la visitación
[43:26] de ación que la naturaleza estaba
[43:29] buscando porque cuando él fue casado a
[43:34] la mujer él tenía la promesa que iba a
[43:38] ver su su grado Pero él se encuentra
[43:41] aquí que se estaba haciendo Ya mayor y
[43:44] mayor y nada estaba pasando pero Gloria
[43:47] a Dios no hay nada nuevo bajo el sol que
[43:50] cuando nosotros entendemos el ciclo
[43:52] sabemos que cuando el sol sube va a
[43:55] salir la vida ahora requiere una una
[43:59] semilla Allí está allí en la tierra
[44:05] ahora el verso 16 dice y él dijo él es
[44:10] el año que viene por este
[44:13] tiempo dice ella dijo No señor varón de
[44:17] Dios no hagas burla de de su sierva dice
[44:22] yo he esperado toda mi vida por esto
[44:26] nadie tod
[44:28] Iglesias ha visto todas las
[44:30] denominaciones no no me no me mientes
[44:34] dice pero nadie me pudo dar vida
[44:37] nadie no más Tom avantaje de mí cuando
[44:41] ella estaba parada allí í en en el pozo
[44:45] tú tenías cinco esposos y la que tienes
[44:48] ahorita no es
[44:50] tuyo ni una de ellas podía quitarle su
[44:53] su vergüenza y abajo de estas siedad
[44:57] fuimos probando allá Aquí allá pero no
[45:02] píos entender hasta Jesucristo no píos
[45:05] entender el misterio de la del libro
[45:07] revelado pero en el tiempo de atardecer
[45:10] cayó en el
[45:12] día y en el día de
[45:15] visitación sabemos Esta es mi palabra y
[45:19] Y esto es la promesa y esta promesa
[45:22] acordando del tiempo de vida
[45:25] es no es no me I va a pasar no es un
[45:30] tiempo momento preciso acordando del
[45:33] tiempo de vida y cuando tú entiendes
[45:36] cuando Cuándo es el tiempo de vida en tu
[45:38] vida Tú ya sabes cómo caminar con
[45:42] precisión con con fuerza y yo voy a
[45:46] reclamar mi ingerencia
[45:49] pero si tien 5050 estamos
[45:53] viendo Cuando el sol va a subir Cuando
[45:57] el sol comienza a subir comienz a ver un
[45:59] poquito de luz no me importa si es si es
[46:03] una revelación total pero mientras que
[46:05] nosotros vemos un poquito de luz vamos a
[46:08] entender la verdad completa porque lo
[46:10] que él comenzó él lo va a traer
[46:14] a y va él es el aor y y va a terminar y
[46:20] cuando nosotros lo creemos a
[46:22] él no me mientas dijo hombre de Dios
[46:27] y y y se dijo
[46:31] no sierva más mujer concibió que Dios
[46:35] que dio a luz a un hijo en el año
[46:40] siguiente Ese es el tiempo que estamos
[46:43] viviendo que el mundo en la iglesia
[46:47] estamos
[46:49] encontrando que este esta revelación
[46:52] antigua Aunque todo este requerimiento
[46:56] que está por la palabra de Dios que la
[46:58] iglesia se ve que está batallando para
[47:01] seguir adelante la iglesia está
[47:05] viéndose Está tratando de ver como el
[47:07] otro el otro mundo como el mundo no hay
[47:12] como eh felicidad en la iglesia estamos
[47:16] sentados allí en la
[47:18] iglesia y y parece que es un problema
[47:21] estar aquí por
[47:23] qué porque hay una decepción allá afuera
[47:26] Porque se ve mucho mejor allá pero que
[47:29] lo que Dios ha prometido Hero branam
[47:31] dice en eh
[47:35] eh espiritual Amnesia Tenían un caso
[47:40] malo y Dios era bueno con ellos y los
[47:44] trajo a una tierra de paganos y y separó
[47:50] la gente a Lo separó a su mismo y dijo
[47:55] él tomó el vino y otro país y
[48:00] plantó en otro país y él lo
[48:05] compuso para hacer que el fruto sea que
[48:12] crezca nos olvida Tratamos de comparar a
[48:16] nosotros a y a veces Después el servicio
[48:21] un días y luego estamos para atrás en
[48:23] esas cosas
[48:29] hay algo mal que está pasando pero
[48:32] viendo Jesús en su programa que esta
[48:35] mujer tiene que tener esta cosa
[48:39] con puede caminar como porque esto es su
[48:43] motivación porque ella es lo que va a
[48:46] mantener trabajando en una línea para
[48:50] poder llegar a una madurez lo que está
[48:53] prometido en la palabra y la palabra
[48:56] aquí dice que
[48:57] que el tipo de esa como un árbol y que
[49:00] este árbol tiene que ser plantado por
[49:03] los ríos de agua y estos Ríos de agua no
[49:06] es un hombre hecho por hombre pero es el
[49:09] mensaje de la hora porque ella cuando
[49:12] ella Recibió la palabra de Eliseo ella
[49:16] tiene que comenzar a trabajar todos los
[49:18] días con el entendimiento que acuerda
[49:23] del tiempo de la
[49:25] vida su mente
[49:27] está enfocada lo que dice el
[49:31] profeta la visión de padmos en Juan 15
[49:35] dice yo soy el vino y y las y
[49:40] dice que que salió de de la de la raíz
[49:46] original ahora
[49:50] el dice que
[49:52] los ahora ve esto
[49:56] tomar un árbol de de limón o de naranja
[50:01] y puedes cortarlo y ponerle un pedazo eh
[50:05] de de
[50:08] toronja y puedes ponerle uno de toronja
[50:11] otras
[50:12] cosas pero
[50:14] esas no van a tomar no van a dar fruto
[50:18] Por
[50:19] qué Porque el limón va a dar
[50:22] limón y la an toronja va a dar y así y
[50:28] esas brazos del árbol Ah va a estar
[50:32] viviendo Pero si
[50:34] esa si ese árbol da otr brazos de de él
[50:41] mismo y si el hijo de hombre viene y da
[50:45] fe en la en el
[50:48] mundo Entonces va a traer una semilla
[50:52] después de él
[50:53] mismo entonces la mujer abajo de la
[50:57] guianza de Eliseo Eliseo de Eliseo y
[51:02] abajo de la guianza de Dios todo junto
[51:06] estamos juntos para dar la misma vida y
[51:10] y esta mujer y está atada lo que Dios ha
[51:15] prometido para que ella pueda cumplir
[51:18] pastores
[51:20] diáconos y esposas todo lo que tú puedes
[51:24] ver que estamos Mister del cuerpo
[51:28] adentro de la mujer porque es lo que
[51:30] estamos enseñando que viendo Dios en su
[51:33] programa que comenzó con con Martin
[51:35] Luther King un ministro que no no pudo
[51:39] seguir el programa pero pero
[51:42] estaba guiado por el comunismo pero aquí
[51:46] vemos que aquí en el programa de Dios lo
[51:49] llamó Eliseo y dijo unge a estas
[51:52] personas estas tres personas tienen
[51:55] cosas específ que van a pasar en la
[51:58] tierra y estamos viendo el
[52:00] mundo que se está poniendo más más
[52:04] exitante por el mensaje o por el Donald
[52:07] Trump que lo eligieron y todas estas
[52:10] cosas pero no pero no
[52:13] hay felicidad por el
[52:16] Ministerio estamos qué va a pasar o qué
[52:20] va a hacer las taxes o qué va a hacer
[52:22] con los negocios
[52:24] pero pero si no cumple lo que él está
[52:29] diciendo
[52:31] entonces tú sabes que el otro en
[52:34] Campamento va a venir con todo poder y
[52:36] eso va a guiarnos al programa de Dios Y
[52:39] si la
[52:40] expectación como el programa de Dios es
[52:43] para que él haga lo que él va a hacer
[52:46] que va a hacer América grande otra vez
[52:48] Entonces el programa de Dios va a
[52:51] fallar porque eso puede entender como el
[52:54] profeta lo dijo
[52:57] porque en el tiempo de Noé estaban
[53:00] andando 7 días para subir entrar al al
[53:03] arca y nunca
[53:05] entraron que no pensaron que estaba loco
[53:09] y Oh 7 días Oh ya no hay
[53:13] lluvia Oh la Guerra de Ucrania va a
[53:16] parar vamos a tener una buena vida y
[53:18] todo esto no sean
[53:21] decepcionados Dios Dios en su
[53:25] programa que él te enseñe lo que está
[53:28] pasando el Donald Trump no va a hacer
[53:30] nada el profeta nos dijo que no hay
[53:34] Abraham Lincoln que no hay nadie bueno
[53:36] que que va a traer para atrás el país el
[53:39] país está tan salido ya con
[53:42] tiempo y y cuando tú rechazas la palabra
[53:47] Ah la palabra entonces tú abres la
[53:50] puerta para el para que entre Y
[53:53] esta es una nación que ha desado todo
[53:56] m con toda
[53:59] la toda la cosa de
[54:04] Jezabel Deja que sea Joe bid sea el
[54:07] Obama el Bush o todo lo que o el musk el
[54:11] que tú
[54:12] quieras el país ya ya está
[54:15] terminado si Dios nos da siete más
[54:18] años y en el tiempo de
[54:22] Noé ha que seguros que estamos
[54:26] estamos adentro del arca y eso es ver
[54:29] Jesús en su programa y saber exactamente
[54:32] nuestra posición porque el programa Aquí
[54:34] nos está enseñando que Eliseo ya ya ha
[54:37] venido y ha ungido la gente y tú te has
[54:40] ungido Por qué y comienzas a ver a
[54:42] Donald Trump como si es su Salvador come
[54:46] iglesia No tú no puedes ver eso sin el
[54:50] programa de Dios
[54:52] porque porque
[54:54] vemos Quédate abajo
[54:57] la ministro no es un sermón este es una
[55:01] llamamiento que no sean decepcionados y
[55:05] Dios está caminando
[55:07] todavía no sean engañados
[55:11] e el el Imperio Romano como el mundo
[55:16] ahora el América está guiando el mundo
[55:18] vieron la
[55:19] manifestación de de
[55:22] adopción y vino para abajo hem recibido
[55:25] la nube ahora en este día y cuando él IV
[55:30] y lo crucificaron por el sistema de
[55:34] Romano y y ellos lo hicieron Para que
[55:37] ellos sean grandes otra vez no y dijo
[55:41] dijo
[55:41] Ora que cuando la destrucción venga que
[55:45] puede ser en tiempo del frío que Ora que
[55:49] cuando con ese tiempo
[55:51] venga no estás abajo de justificación o
[55:54] santificación un nivel
[55:57] pero sea
[55:59] adoptado que esté puesta en el cuerpo
[56:03] como la mujer dice no yo sé que este
[56:06] hombre es un hombre de Dios hay que
[56:10] traerlo hay que traerlo para dentro la
[56:12] casa hay que poner una mesa y y poner
[56:16] todos los cintas y todo hay que ser t
[56:20] listos y el profeta nos está enseñando
[56:23] que esta iglesia
[56:25] aquí Estas ideas y Ah poniendo brazos en
[56:30] el árbol dijo
[56:32] No tienes que tener la
[56:36] Simiente porque la raíz es donde estaba
[56:39] la semilla y y sabio subió el árbol pero
[56:43] ese árbol puede producir su su
[56:48] propio brazos va salir su propio semilla
[56:52] Y esa semilla es lo que estamos buscando
[56:54] Porque esa sem va traer atrás a la misma
[57:00] Simiente no es como vamos vendo la
[57:03] iglesia y la iglesia está parada aquí o
[57:06] políticos acá y esto Esto se va a poner
[57:08] no no se va a poner mejor queremos irnos
[57:11] a
[57:12] casa queremos irnos a
[57:14] casa y cuando nosotros queremos ir a
[57:17] casa no estamos viendo el
[57:20] calendario tú sabes el tiempo el
[57:25] ciclo 1 días o es en 15 días es en 4
[57:30] días
[57:34] porque pero cuando el hijo vino a Denver
[57:38] Mira el tiempo y y el Cuando est
[57:42] comienza a sa ver esto comienza a parar
[57:44] en la puerta y vas a verme venir cuando
[57:47] todas las hermanas estaban viéndola a
[57:50] ella Oh como tú crees que eso va a pasar
[57:53] tú crees que el hermano br sí sabe lo
[57:55] que está habl
[57:57] Tú crees que esto va a pasar y tú no
[58:01] sabes pero ahí
[58:03] está es la voz de mi amor Él viene en la
[58:08] con los caballos yo lo puedo oír
[58:12] viniendo y no n más que viene el da da
[58:19] ida y él está viniendo para llevarnos
[58:22] para afuera para qué es nuestro fento a
[58:25] las hermanas las dominaciones o
[58:27] políticas
[58:29] no porque la mujer dijo No no me mientas
[58:33] dij la mujer yo yo estoy tomándote
[58:37] seriamente Yo te he visto y te oído a
[58:39] tus
[58:41] cintas No me digas mentiras yo soy tu
[58:44] sirviente y yo he dado al agua a los
[58:48] camellos y este mensaje tiene que
[58:51] llevarme a mi esposo y este mensaje no
[58:54] me lleva a nuestro
[58:57] patrón Entonces qué Vamos a hacer
[59:00] entonces somos
[59:02] engañados y tenemos que estar bien
[59:05] seguros de
[59:08] Dios dice Así es como es la iglesia y el
[59:12] árbol se fue quebrado y han entrado
[59:16] otros brazos han metido brazos de
[59:19] bautisa
[59:22] bautismo y y esas brazos están dando
[59:27] frutos de
[59:28] dominación y nos
[59:32] llamamos creyentes del mensaje y no
[59:36] estamos entendiendo nuestra doctrina
[59:38] aquí allá pero si vamos para atrás a las
[59:42] primera Simiente la palabra hablada
[59:45] tenemos que producir la misma
[59:48] cosa que Dios me ayude aquí y que sigue
[59:52] adelante rápido y
[59:56] de dominación que produce la fruta pero
[59:58] si el árbol da otra brazo Pero va a ser
[1:00:03] exactamente que del árbol igual va a ser
[1:00:08] que salió de Pentecostés va a hablar en
[1:00:11] lenguas va a profetizar y tener el poder
[1:00:14] de la resurrección de
[1:00:17] Jesucristo Por
[1:00:19] qué Porque está tratando lo natural la
[1:00:23] está buscando la misma vida del de la
[1:00:28] Oh br dijo esto aquí o yo pienso esto Oh
[1:00:32] fue muy radical o está haciendo una
[1:00:35] broma o no realmente
[1:00:38] entendía Pero mira el patrón en en el
[1:00:42] mensaje siéntete con el profeta déjame
[1:00:45] insistir en
[1:00:47] eso siéntete con el profeta Mira el
[1:00:50] patrón del
[1:00:52] 47 hasta 65 es la misma patrón el mismo
[1:00:57] patrón él puede expresarse por
[1:01:01] oraciones o línea de oración o
[1:01:04] discernimientos y todas estas cosas lo
[1:01:06] quieres llamar primer jalón segundo
[1:01:09] jalón Pero cuando Dios comenzó abrir su
[1:01:13] palabra ya no no es un Dios parcial
[1:01:17] porque él es de Génesis hasta
[1:01:21] Apocalipsis no ha dado un poquito de
[1:01:24] fundación en los
[1:01:26] en los 50 en los 60 y estamos madurando
[1:01:31] para ver qu qué fue lo que dijo en el
[1:01:37] 60
[1:01:40] entonces estendo Mens Oh Esto no es
[1:01:43] importante y tú V a pasar que vas a
[1:01:46] llegar un carro Oh el carro má Son son
[1:01:51] los rines y los asientos yo necesito
[1:01:55] neito las plogas
[1:01:57] no todos los inyectores pero el carro no
[1:02:00] se puede
[1:02:02] mover no puedes ir ni un
[1:02:04] lugar porque has creído cosas de alguien
[1:02:08] un mensaje de alguien más pero el
[1:02:10] hermano br dice Qué tan bueno es tener
[1:02:13] un edificio tan bonito gente tan bonita
[1:02:16] pero no hay poder del espíritu santo en
[1:02:19] ellos que para qué sirve que nos vemos
[1:02:22] como creyentes pero no hay mensaje
[1:02:25] dentro de nosotros
[1:02:27] es lo que está expresando aquí que si
[1:02:30] nosotros somos la misma la mismo árbol
[1:02:34] la misma Simiente y va a traer la misma
[1:02:39] semilla va a traer por porque no
[1:02:42] s é no está viendo a nosotros para tener
[1:02:47] la misma vida del
[1:02:50] árbol no hay debate en
[1:02:53] esto esos que ido eito que no hay debate
[1:02:57] todos ya saben todo está listo todo lo
[1:03:00] que más tienes que decir sí señor tú no
[1:03:03] más te paras allí dices Sí señor córtate
[1:03:06] el pelo sí señor Oh levantarte a las 5
[1:03:09] Sí señor Así es no hay debate no hay
[1:03:14] democracia y hay límites en
[1:03:18] democracia y te han hecho muchas cosas
[1:03:21] el profeta nos dice que la única cosa
[1:03:23] que va a trabajar Que Dios bendiciendo
[1:03:26] un rey que él escogió y la ciudad que
[1:03:32] tiene es el rey del hijo de David es son
[1:03:37] palabras
[1:03:39] precisas necesitamos traer la palabra
[1:03:42] necesitamos traer la
[1:03:44] semilla Por
[1:03:46] qué no no fue puesta ahí Eva fue nacida
[1:03:52] adentro del del
[1:03:54] árbol cuando tod otros brazos fueron
[1:03:58] puestos Ahí no más podían poner su misma
[1:04:01] fruta de los brazos pero no del
[1:04:05] árbol no saben de esta vida original o
[1:04:10] la fruta original no no saben que no
[1:04:13] fueron nacidos de eso pero si ellos
[1:04:16] fueron nacidos de esa original esa misma
[1:04:19] vida que fue en el árbol original
[1:04:22] Jesús iba a venir
[1:04:26] Y
[1:04:27] manestar ante
[1:04:29] ellos y Dios está viendo en eso y cuando
[1:04:33] él está viendo
[1:04:34] eso está bien
[1:04:37] presente que es no es acuerdo a su
[1:04:40] promesa y
[1:04:43] Isaías
[1:04:45] yó a
[1:04:48] Dios Simiente
[1:04:52] original quec
[1:05:00] va ver su
[1:05:01] semilla y va poner su días más
[1:05:05] largos y Dios está cambiando de
[1:05:09] formas abajo Las
[1:05:11] edades porque la mujer no podía tener
[1:05:14] niño hab una
[1:05:17] promesa que no ibas a ser sin niño y
[1:05:22] dijo y tiene que ver la semilla
[1:05:26] pero la que sem mía tenía que haber una
[1:05:29] tierra y esa tierra es la mujer y esta
[1:05:33] mujer Ahora tiene que traer acuerdo
[1:05:37] de
[1:05:39] Mesías yo no te llamo ustedes iglesia ya

[1:06:02] entendimiento y eso no

[1:06:07] poder preguntar
[1:06:09] eso como Rebeca hizo con
[1:06:14] isac yo digo por
[1:06:25] dando
[1:06:26] hijos por eso vamos a la
[1:06:30] iglesia queremos hacer
[1:06:35] jóvenes pero no es el el el marido que
[1:06:39] nos va a hacer vamos a doctores y ellos
[1:06:42] hacen todo lo que
[1:06:44] puedan están tomando bebés y están
[1:06:47] quitando las vidas y todo para hac los
[1:06:51] jóvenes ahora en China están haciendo
[1:06:54] cambio de cara Por qué Porque ese
[1:06:57] llamamiento adentro para vivir por
[1:07:00] siempre
[1:07:02] es que él va a ver su
[1:07:06] semilla no vinieron como la palabra

[1:07:44] arca pero la iglesia no quiere porque
[1:07:49] que fueron puestas allí si se fueron
[1:07:53] puestos por eso muí
[1:07:56] creer el
[1:07:57] profeta por eso están hallando errores
[1:07:59] en el mensaje pero si el como Eliseo se
[1:08:05] queda se quedó abajo del Ministerio de
[1:08:09] Eliseo el profeta nos está enseñando en
[1:08:12] diferentes formas y todos los ejemplos
[1:08:15] es la misma
[1:08:18] patrón diferentes ejemplos sueños mujer
[1:08:22] ministerio hijo de Dios nov Apóstoles
[1:08:27] todas estas cosas es el mismo programa
[1:08:30] que Dios está está revelándose el
[1:08:32] profeta dijo
[1:08:34] que que hizo bueno para esconder pero no
[1:08:37] ha revelado todo en todos los tipos y
[1:08:40] sombras de la
[1:08:42] Biblia y si tú puedes ver Jesús en su
[1:08:46] programa Qué vas a

[1:09:09] prosperar en su mano y esta mujer y este
[1:09:14] hombre que fue
[1:09:19] engañada en salmos
[1:09:22] 128 vamos a leerlo aquí
[1:09:25] que fue una
[1:09:27] bendición el sermón fue
[1:09:29] cambiado tenía que ir
[1:09:33] a tiene que ir en otro canal pero por la
[1:09:36] gracia de
[1:09:37] Dios fue sorprendido yo mismo que que
[1:09:41] esto es
[1:09:43] bueno que las personas neitan otras
[1:09:46] cosas que me fue dado porque él camina
[1:09:50] contigo todos los días él te ve a ti él
[1:09:53] sabe exactamente que es lo que está
[1:09:56] pasando en tu vida y por la gracia de
[1:09:59] Dios
[1:10:00] eso son los grandes elementos que hem
[1:10:05] deseado salmos
[1:10:11] 28 bien aturado todos aquel que teme al
[1:10:15] Jehová que anda en sus caminos cuando
[1:10:17] comieres el trabajo de tus
[1:10:19] manos serás y te irá bien tu mujer será
[1:10:24] como que lleva fruto a los lados de tu
[1:10:34] casa tus hijos como plantas de olivo
[1:10:38] alrededor de tu
[1:10:41] mesa
[1:10:43] y y aquí será bendecido el hombre que ti

[1:11:04] bien de Jerusalén todos los días de tu
[1:11:06] vida y veas a los hijos de tus hijos Paz
[1:11:11] sea sobre
[1:11:13] Israel y esa es la promesa y estamos
[1:11:17] viendo por estas promesas para que fan
[1:11:19] cumplidas estamos viendo que el programa
[1:11:22] de Dios está alineándose como esta mujer
[1:11:25] las promesas fueron que fueron que den
[1:11:28] fruto Qué es esta
[1:11:31] mujer Quién es esta mujer Qué está
[1:11:37] haciendo quizás los mismos 20 minutos va
[1:11:39] a ser mi sermón aquí quién puede
[1:11:42] encontrar una mujer
[1:11:45] virtuosa Quién es esta mujer quién puede
[1:11:48] encontrar esta
[1:11:50] mujer hermano br Qué estás haciendo Oh

[1:12:06] irme y con esta palabra fue dado a él
[1:12:09] esta
[1:12:11] responsabilidad
[1:12:13] Ven y ve aquí que no vas a ir allá
[1:12:20] dominación no derá ir allá a las hijas
[1:12:23] de cann porque sabemos Quiénes son
[1:12:26] sabemos que ellos fueron puestos pero dó
[1:12:30] esta mujer virtuosa Dónde
[1:12:32] está entonces comienza a dar una
[1:12:36] descripción
[1:12:39] dice Cuando tú vayas
[1:12:42] allá quiero que entiendas el tipo de
[1:12:46] mujer tengo que darte la
[1:12:48] descripción el misterio de esa mujer
[1:12:52] porque cuando tú vas allá
[1:12:55] con una una aparencia de
[1:12:57] afuera porque
[1:12:59] en es como tipo de
[1:13:04] como como los católicos como Cómo se
[1:13:08] visten Cómo hablan y todo Buen dice yo
[1:13:13] he visto tantas cosas que los hindús y
[1:13:17] todos los
[1:13:19] muslos han puesto que han hecho mucha
[1:13:22] sinceridad que
[1:13:25] que no han puesto ni los cristianos han
[1:13:27] podido dar eso pero él está tratando la
[1:13:31] descripción de esta mujer quién puede
[1:13:34] encontrar una mujer virtuosa su precio
[1:13:37] está más arriba
[1:13:41] de que su vida está tan
[1:13:45] preciosa mujer virtuosa quién la hallará
[1:13:49] porque su estima sobrepasa lamente a las
[1:13:53] de las piedras preciosas
[1:13:56] Qué es mejor el pan o el dinero que te
[1:13:58] en tu
[1:13:59] cuenta y ahora tienes que comparar los
[1:14:01] dos por eso la el costo de oportunidad
[1:14:05] que vas a hacer lo que tú
[1:14:08] tienes Jesús está viendo la
[1:14:11] promesa dice tú me
[1:14:13] prometiste que yo voy a ver mi
[1:14:16] semilla tú me prometistes

[1:14:28] hijos pero dónde está la mujer virtuosa
[1:14:31] que va a tomar mi
[1:14:33] palabra que va a ser nacida no de mi no
[1:14:38] que fue
[1:14:39] puesta pero cuando pagó el precio en la
[1:14:42] cruz ahí en el lado fue abierto y y

[1:14:56] en ella
[1:15:01] confiando no está siempre deando con
[1:15:04] é si yo le digo algo ella
[1:15:10] o eso es
[1:15:12] absoluto pero en esta
[1:15:18] hora
[1:15:21] erores y está parado viendo
[1:15:27] p aquí
[1:15:30] pasa tan simple como
[1:15:34] es contra todos los creences que tenemos
[1:15:37] en el mundo
[1:15:39] ahora ella tiene que decir
[1:15:43] también no es tu
