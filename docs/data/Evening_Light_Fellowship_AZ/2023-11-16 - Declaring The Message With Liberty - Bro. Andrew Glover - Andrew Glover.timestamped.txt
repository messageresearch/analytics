[32:42] and if you have your Bibles tonight
[32:44] we'll go straight to the word we want to
[32:47] invite you in the New Testament uh to
[32:49] the book of Acts the 20th chapter the
[32:51] book of Acts the 20th chapter and sure
[32:54] good to see all of our friends here
[32:55] tonight different ones I don't want to
[32:56] start calling names will miss somebody
[32:58] but it sure is good to good to be in the
[33:00] presence of the Lord in fellowship
[33:02] tonight amen the book of Acts the 20th
[33:05] chapter and we want to look here in the
[33:07] 25th
[33:09] verse Paul here writing his Farewell
[33:13] words he says Now Behold I know that ye
[33:16] all among whom I have gone preaching the
[33:20] kingdom of God shall see my face no more
[33:22] so Paul was not going about preaching
[33:24] himself but he was going about preaching
[33:26] the king Kingdom in the 26th verse he
[33:28] said wherefore I take you to record this
[33:30] day that I am pure from the blood of all
[33:33] men for I have not shunned to declare
[33:36] unto you all the counsel of God I have
[33:40] not shunned to declare unto you all the
[33:42] counsel of God now watch verse 28 take
[33:45] heed therefore unto yourselves and to
[33:47] all the flock over which the Holy Ghost
[33:49] hath made you overseers to feed the
[33:52] Church of God which he hath P purchased
[33:55] with his own blood now I believe believe
[33:57] that the things that Paul was declaring
[33:59] was actually going to become the food to
[34:01] the Church of the Living God he was not
[34:03] declaring himself but he was declaring
[34:05] the revelation of the word in the 29th
[34:07] verse he said for I know this that after
[34:10] my departing shall Grievous wolves enter
[34:13] in among you not sparing the flock and
[34:15] also of your own selves shall men arise
[34:18] so they're not going to come in from
[34:19] outside but they're going to arise of
[34:22] your own selves speaking perverse things
[34:25] to draw away disciples after them
[34:28] therefore watch and remember that by the
[34:31] space of three years I ceased not to
[34:34] warn everyone night and day with tears
[34:37] now watch verse 32 and now Brethren I
[34:40] commend you to God and to the word of
[34:42] his grace which is able to build you up
[34:45] and to give you an inheritance among all
[34:47] them which are Sanctified amen we ask
[34:51] the Lord this evening to add the
[34:52] blessing to the reading of his word as
[34:53] you can have your seats here uh this
[34:55] afternoon I want to by the the help of
[34:57] the Lord for just a few moments uh to
[34:59] speak to you tonight if I will title
[35:00] this I want to speak to you on declaring
[35:03] the message with Liberty uh declaring
[35:05] the message with Liberty I've just been
[35:08] uh studying and speaking a series of
[35:09] thoughts along these lines of of I
[35:11] started actually on a thought from
[35:13] Isaiah 35 on in the middle of the road
[35:16] uh with liberty and I was studying how
[35:18] that the Bible said there amen that
[35:20] there would be a highway and then Isaiah
[35:22] brought it down and said there would be
[35:23] a way and he said that would be the way
[35:25] of Holiness and he said said the fool
[35:27] shall not he therein if you study the
[35:29] New Testament Matthew 7:14 and 15 the
[35:32] Bible says that there's actually two
[35:34] ways there's the Broadway that leadth
[35:36] unto destruction and many go therein at
[35:38] but then there's a narrow way and that
[35:40] way leadth unto life and me he says few
[35:43] there will be that will find it and as I
[35:45] begin to study these things I begin to
[35:46] realize as uh the prophet of God would
[35:48] speak to us about the middle of the road
[35:50] and there be in a way amen that it would
[35:52] actually be essential for believers Amen
[35:55] to find a balance in all things both in
[35:57] our natural life as well as in our
[35:59] spiritual life and you know when I
[36:01] started thinking about that balance I
[36:03] couldn't help but think of how I've
[36:04] heard it shared that brother Brandon
[36:06] would actually tell brother Perry green
[36:07] he said brother Perry always keep your
[36:09] balance Amen in the scripture so brother
[36:11] Bram was not bringing something outside
[36:13] of the word amen but he was bringing
[36:15] something from the word and when you
[36:17] look at that word balance it means a
[36:19] condition in which different elements
[36:21] are equal amen or in their correct
[36:23] proportions it is the stability of one's
[36:26] mind or heing Amen to keep or put
[36:28] something in a steady position amen so
[36:31] that it does not fall so there's
[36:32] actually a direct connection amen
[36:35] between stability and balance between
[36:37] position and balance because the prophet
[36:39] of God would say if you go to the doctor
[36:41] and get a prescription uh the doctor
[36:43] will write a prescription he said now
[36:45] there's enough antidote in there Amen to
[36:47] upset the poison he said then there's
[36:49] enough poison to upset the antidote he
[36:51] said see because it's all got to be
[36:53] balanced now that's in the natural amen
[36:55] but then we understand that God has sent
[36:57] us a spiritual prescription amen and the
[37:00] prophet of God said the original and
[37:01] eternal prescription is acts the 2
[37:04] chapter and he said if you'll take it to
[37:05] the one who wrote it amen he will give
[37:07] it to you and you'll get the same
[37:09] results that they got amen when they
[37:11] took it back then amen because see a
[37:13] prescription in order to have an effect
[37:16] amen it must be balanced now I'll just
[37:18] say what I believe here for a few
[37:19] moments amen I do not believe amen that
[37:22] God sent us an unbalanced message amen
[37:24] and they needed a bunch of preachers to
[37:26] bring into balance but I believe amen
[37:28] that God sent a balanced message Amen to
[37:31] a church that was unbalanced Amen to
[37:33] bring them from the ditches of
[37:35] fundamentalism or the ditches of
[37:37] Pentecostalism amen and to bring them to
[37:40] the middle of the road you know as well
[37:41] as I know the prophet said amen that the
[37:43] balance will be amen when you can get
[37:45] the two together now uh just just laying
[37:48] a foundation here he said if you could
[37:49] ever get that fundamental Faith amen or
[37:52] fundamental Doctrine with the
[37:53] Pentecostal people he said then my what
[37:56] a me meting that you would have and you
[37:57] know he would say that that the
[37:59] Pentecostals have been looked down upon
[38:01] as maybe a low class or on the other
[38:03] side of the railroad tracks are not that
[38:05] important a bunch of bunch of fanaticism
[38:08] amen so they would actually be looked at
[38:09] as the low class but then you would look
[38:11] at the the fundamentals and maybe they
[38:13] were on the maybe the the upper class
[38:15] and they would be looked at as educated
[38:17] or smart or whatever amen but a prophet
[38:19] was not coming Amen to to continue in a
[38:22] ditch he was coming to pull from both
[38:25] sides Amen to pull from the Pentecostals
[38:27] as well as the fundamentals amen and
[38:29] produce a middle class that would walk
[38:32] Amen in the middle of the road now when
[38:34] you start studying the middle of the
[38:35] road it's a beautiful study from a
[38:37] prophet he will say that the road is
[38:39] actually built Amen to where the highest
[38:42] part of the road is in the center he
[38:44] said the reason that is is because it
[38:46] lets all the trash amen wash off to both
[38:49] sides and I love how he says it he said
[38:51] see when the rain comes amen the rain
[38:53] will wash all the trash off amen so that
[38:56] does not leave the responsibility up to
[38:58] us Amen to keep the road clean but when
[39:01] the rain falls amen the rain has the
[39:03] ability to wash off the trash amen and
[39:06] keep a people centered and focused in
[39:08] the middle of the road he said that the
[39:10] true message from the scriptures amen it
[39:13] lays in the center of the road he also
[39:15] says that the angel of the Lord amen he
[39:18] dwells in the center of the road now
[39:20] this is my favorite quote he said I
[39:22] always preach in the middle of the road
[39:25] amen so when a Prophet was preaching he
[39:27] was not preaching from a ditch amen he
[39:30] was preaching from the middle of the
[39:31] road amen because if you get out of the
[39:34] middle of the road brother said then
[39:35] your adoption will leave you amen but we
[39:38] are here as a generation that is not
[39:40] running from adoption amen but we have
[39:42] come into our adoption and we are being
[39:45] positionally placed as the Sons and
[39:47] Daughters of God now you all know the
[39:49] prophet said that you were Sons and
[39:51] Daughters at Birth right amen you were a
[39:53] son at Birth but then your adoption amen
[39:56] would be your positionally plac it now
[39:58] watch a prophet he said some people when
[40:00] they get born again they sit right in
[40:02] the middle of the road amen Their Eyes
[40:03] On Christ but finally they get over here
[40:06] and they get so much knowledge and
[40:07] wisdom till oh they know it all he said
[40:10] you don't know nothing and if you don't
[40:11] do that he said then if you run off to a
[40:13] bunch of wildfire and fanaticism amen
[40:16] but right in the middle of the road
[40:18] there's a true sound unadulterated
[40:21] gospel amen and power of God right down
[40:24] through there taking the Kings and the
[40:25] monarch where anybody can stand in
[40:28] Search and they can see amen that it's
[40:30] the power of almighty God it's not a
[40:33] fanaticism amen neither is it a
[40:35] formality it's the power of God Amen
[40:38] it's a beautiful thing I don't have time
[40:40] to give you the whole study tonight amen
[40:42] but it's a beautiful thing to watch a
[40:43] prophet run this all the way through and
[40:45] even come down and say some have made
[40:47] the gospel of Frolic he said then some
[40:50] have made it a funeral procession right
[40:52] he said but it's neither he said it's a
[40:55] feast amen amen so a feast is only found
[40:58] in the middle of the road friends I've
[41:00] always he said tried to keep a balance
[41:02] of the road he said you get way off on
[41:04] formalism just as form and ritualistic
[41:07] as they can be he said and people grab
[41:09] for that a lot then if you don't want
[41:11] that you get Plum on the other side just
[41:12] just fanatic amen but there's a middle
[41:15] of the road how many will agree there's
[41:16] a middle of the road amen where the true
[41:19] sound San gospel is preached amen and
[41:22] God moves in there vindicating it to be
[41:25] the truth amen then that does not
[41:27] relieve or that relieves preachers from
[41:29] the responsibility amen of vindicating
[41:31] the message Amen to receiving a message
[41:34] that has already been Vindicated he said
[41:37] the main thing is right in the middle of
[41:39] the road with enough spirit in you to
[41:41] keep you warm and moving and knowing
[41:43] enough to keep yourself under obedience
[41:46] to the spirit just to move as the spirit
[41:48] moves amen not till or after amen but
[41:52] just as the spirit moves amen I believe
[41:55] here tonight that that we are a
[41:56] spiritual people I believe we are
[41:58] Desiring amen the leadership of the
[42:01] spirit of God right amen as sons of God
[42:04] they are led by the spirit of God and
[42:06] you know as sons of God sometimes we
[42:08] wonder amen what do we really need to be
[42:11] what God has called us to be you know
[42:13] maybe someone say well I needed to be
[42:15] born in this family or I needed to to
[42:17] come out of this move or I needed to
[42:19] come out of this church amen but I
[42:21] believe that all we need Amen to be what
[42:24] God has called us to be is Liberty amen
[42:27] the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 3:17 he
[42:30] said now the Lord is that spirit and
[42:32] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[42:35] Liberty amen the Lord is that spirit and
[42:38] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[42:41] Liberty now that word Liberty has a
[42:43] beautiful definition it is the Liberty
[42:45] to do amen or to Omit things having no
[42:49] relationship to Salvation amen Liberty
[42:52] is a license it's the Liberty to do as
[42:54] one pleases a watch this true Liberty is
[42:58] not living as we want to but it's living
[43:00] as we ought to amen so if we have
[43:03] Liberty amen then we're not living
[43:05] according to our flesh amen we are
[43:07] living according to our spirit amen
[43:09] which is on the inside which the Holy
[43:11] Ghost has taken control of the control
[43:14] tower amen and I believe that God has
[43:16] sent a message at this hour amen that
[43:18] has omitted all the nonsense amen and
[43:21] things that does not have any connection
[43:24] Amen to true relationship with God and
[43:27] true salvation the prophet said in the
[43:29] church age book not for one moment do I
[43:31] bring a message so he's declaring a
[43:33] message Amen to the people that they may
[43:35] follow me or they may join my church or
[43:38] start some fellowship my organization I
[43:41] have never done that and will not do
[43:43] that now I have no interest in those
[43:45] things amen but I do have an interest in
[43:47] the things of God Amen and people and if
[43:49] I can accomplish just one thing I will
[43:52] be satisfied and that one thing is to
[43:54] see established amen a true spiritual
[43:58] relationship between God and Men wherein
[44:00] men become New Creations in Christ amen
[44:03] and they are filled with his spirit amen
[44:05] and they live according to his word amen
[44:08] listen church I believe in receiving the
[44:11] baptism amen of the Holy Ghost but that
[44:13] was the third stage amen of a complete
[44:16] restoration amen we're not here just to
[44:18] receive the Holy Ghost and have a repeat
[44:20] of aus or have a repeat of 1906 amen but
[44:24] the justification made way for
[44:26] sanctification and sanctification made
[44:29] way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:31] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost has
[44:33] made way for the person himself Amen to
[44:36] come down into the church amen in the
[44:38] Perfection of the word listen we're not
[44:40] just a bunch of Christians shouting on
[44:42] Sunday and living like the devil on
[44:44] Monday amen but this message has brought
[44:47] a stability it has brought a balance to
[44:49] the life of the church and we're walking
[44:51] and living according to his word amen
[44:54] and in that middle of the road we got
[44:55] Liberty how many how many agree in the
[44:57] middle of the road we got Liberty Amen
[44:59] in the middle of the road there is
[45:01] Liberty now when you start talking about
[45:03] Liberty amen we've got to identify amen
[45:06] the source of our Liberty now I love it
[45:08] because our Liberty thank you our
[45:10] Liberty is not man-made it is not maniv
[45:14] amen our Liberty comes from the word of
[45:17] God Amen now I believe the Bible is very
[45:20] specific in 1 John 1:1 it says that
[45:22] which was from the beginning which we
[45:24] have heard which we have seen with our
[45:26] eyes which we have looked upon and our
[45:28] hands have handled amen of the word of
[45:31] life now watch verse Two for the life
[45:33] was manifested and we have seen it and
[45:36] bear witness amen and show unto you that
[45:38] eternal life which was with the father
[45:41] amen and was manifested unto us amen
[45:43] that which we have seen and heard amen
[45:46] declare we unto you that you also may
[45:49] have fellowship with us and truly our
[45:51] fellowship is with the father and with
[45:54] his son Jesus Christ amen now watch
[45:56] these three words seen heard and declare
[45:59] that word see means to see with the eyes
[46:02] it means to see with the mind it means
[46:04] to perceive amen that word seen gives
[46:07] the pro uh the prominence to the
[46:09] Discerning mind amen then John says
[46:12] we've seen But now we've heard and that
[46:14] word heard means not to be deaf it means
[46:17] to perceive by the ear amen what is
[46:19] announced in one's presence it is to
[46:22] learn to give ear to a teaching or a
[46:24] teacher so John says we have seen amen
[46:27] and we have heard amen but now declare
[46:30] we unto you and that word declare means
[46:33] to Proclaim and to make known openly and
[46:36] he says these things right we unto you
[46:38] that your joy may be full and I love
[46:40] verse five amen this then is the message
[46:43] which we have heard of him and declare
[46:45] unto you amen that God is light and in
[46:48] him is no Darkness at all now when you
[46:51] look at that word message the Greek
[46:53] definition amen is an announcement it is
[46:55] a a promise it is the act of promising
[46:58] it is a promise given or to be given it
[47:01] is a promise good or blessing so we
[47:03] could very easily brother Russell read
[47:05] that and say this then is the
[47:07] announcement amen this then is the
[47:09] promise this then is the blessing that
[47:11] God is light and in him is no Darkness
[47:14] at all I love what the prophet says he
[47:16] said father we ask tonight for Mercy
[47:19] amen for Liberty of spirit that we might
[47:22] be able to bring the people the gospel
[47:24] truth amen of what we believe to be the
[47:27] message of the hour amen for your church
[47:30] amen the only thing the prophet needed
[47:33] Amen to bring his message amen with some
[47:35] Liberty to bring it into he was not
[47:37] needing a denomination he was not
[47:39] needing a pope or a bishop amen or
[47:42] somebody to give him permission he was
[47:44] just needing somewhere he could have
[47:46] some Liberty to declare amen the things
[47:48] that God was revealing to him in the
[47:51] season that he was living you know as I
[47:53] look across this building tonight amen I
[47:55] see all kinds of Believers of different
[47:57] ages amen I believe we can raise our
[47:59] hands and we can say we have seen the
[48:01] message amen I believe we can say we
[48:03] have heard the message amen but I tell
[48:05] you what I believe I believe it's time
[48:07] to declare the
[48:08] message I think we've seen it I think
[48:11] we've heard it brother Robert I think
[48:13] now is the time Amen to declare it I
[48:16] love what Isaiah says in Isaiah 48:6 he
[48:19] said th has heard and see all this and
[48:21] will not ye declare it I have showed
[48:24] thee new things from this time
[48:26] amen even hidden things that thou did
[48:28] not know them amen so here is coming
[48:31] secret things into Revelation amen the
[48:34] hidden things are becoming revealed amen
[48:37] now you all know the prophet reads
[48:38] Deuteronomy 29 and verse 29 and says the
[48:42] secret things amen belong unto the Lord
[48:44] Our God Amen so we have no right Amen to
[48:48] declare secret things that belong unto
[48:50] the Lord amen but those things which are
[48:52] revealed they belong unto us and to our
[48:55] children forever that we may do amen all
[48:59] the words of this law listen friends if
[49:01] it's still a secret it does not belong
[49:03] to us it belongs to God Amen but when
[49:06] it's revealed amen it moves from
[49:08] belonging to God un belonging to his
[49:11] children and we are not waiting for God
[49:13] to send a prophet and reveal the seventh
[49:15] seal and reveal the third pull he has
[49:18] already revealed it and there's a people
[49:20] on the Earth tonight who are the
[49:22] possessors of the revelation of the
[49:24] mystery of Christ that dwelleth in you
[49:27] amen I believe it tonight friends I
[49:29] believe that God sent a prophet Amen to
[49:31] reveal to this church amen that the most
[49:33] the most mysterious book of the Bible
[49:35] with all kinds of symbols amen belongs
[49:38] unto his children and the prophet of God
[49:40] says the Book of Revelation it has more
[49:43] symbols in it than all the rest of the
[49:45] books in the Bible it has more symbols
[49:47] amen why because it's a book of Prophecy
[49:50] it's a prophetic book therefore it has
[49:52] to be understood amen by a prophetic
[49:55] class amen a prophetic book has to be
[49:58] understood by a prophetic class he said
[50:01] this book is not meant for anybody or
[50:03] everybody rather he said the book is
[50:06] made for a certain class of people and
[50:08] can I say it to you like this amen The
[50:10] Book of Revelation was not going to be
[50:12] revealed Amen in a fundamental ditch
[50:15] amen because they would just made a morg
[50:17] out of it and neither was it going to be
[50:19] revealed in a Pentecostal ditch amen but
[50:21] when God sent a prophet Amen to pull
[50:24] from both sides and gather the seed in
[50:26] the middle of the road he began to
[50:29] declare the things that was on the back
[50:31] part of his mind amen because there was
[50:33] a people in the middle of the road that
[50:35] would not become a fanatic with it and
[50:38] neither they become a a dead
[50:39] intellectual person now come on church
[50:42] amen but they would walk as Sons and
[50:44] Daughters of God Amen manifesting the
[50:47] desire of God for their lives amen the
[50:50] carnal mind cannot comprehend great
[50:52] things of the scripture because it's
[50:54] foolish to them amen but to the ones who
[50:56] are lovers of the word of God Amen to
[50:59] those who are lovers of the word of God
[51:01] Amen that who the book was written to
[51:04] amen the church amen I love that brother
[51:07] brother Ron amen the revealed things
[51:09] belong to us amen the revealed things
[51:12] they are our possession amen the
[51:14] revealed things that's our bread the
[51:16] revealed things that's our food come on
[51:19] that's why we're not out here blazing
[51:20] new trails and trying to find something
[51:22] new to say every week amen we're
[51:24] satisfied amen feeding from the
[51:26] wheelbarrow loads amen of food that's
[51:29] been stored up amen fine healthy
[51:31] vegetables have been restored and
[51:33] they've been released in this generation
[51:36] Amen to feed a bride and to move her
[51:38] from mortality into immortality amen the
[51:41] revealed things belong to us can I just
[51:43] go ahead and say it you are not a
[51:45] trespasser in the revelation of this
[51:48] message you got to ride in the
[51:51] revelation of what a prophet taught if
[51:53] it come from the scripture and it come
[51:55] from the message you got a right Amen to
[51:57] declare it because that's your food and
[52:00] it belongs to you amen that'd be like
[52:02] somebody that' be like somebody giving
[52:03] you a steak you know and somebody come
[52:05] along saying don't eat that don't eat
[52:07] that don't eat that well why can't I eat
[52:09] it amen it belongs to me amen and we got
[52:12] tapes where the Prophet said rapturing
[52:15] Faith amen is laying on these tapes amen
[52:18] then listen friends there ain't no man
[52:20] got a right to interpret amen what we
[52:22] can preach and what we can't preach amen
[52:24] God is sent a prophet in this generation
[52:26] to unveil the word and to release to us
[52:29] a seven course meal the revealed things
[52:32] belong to us amen now there's two
[52:34] powerful quotes I love amen the prophet
[52:37] says and from that time 62 he says my
[52:39] Ministry is a different Ministry from a
[52:42] pastor or a teacher he said if I say
[52:44] things wrong Brethren forgive me I don't
[52:46] mean to amen but this is my Ministry
[52:49] amen this is my Ministry see Amen to
[52:52] declare him that he's here amen a
[52:55] prophet was announcing a promise amen
[52:58] that Jesus Christ the son of God would
[53:01] return to the church in the form of his
[53:03] word but there would be a forerunner on
[53:05] the earth to announce he's here in the
[53:08] anointed ones at the end time he said
[53:10] the very day when this messenger when he
[53:12] starts on Amen not when he starts on but
[53:14] when he begins to declare his message
[53:17] see the first pool was healing the
[53:19] second pull was prophesied amen but the
[53:22] third pull was the opening of the word
[53:24] the Mysteries revealed and there's no
[53:27] more higher order to reveal the word
[53:29] than prophets but the only way the
[53:31] prophet can be Vindicated is by the word
[53:34] and remember somebody say remember
[53:36] remember the third pull was the opening
[53:39] of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden
[53:42] truth that was hidden in the word amen
[53:45] so if this is the third pool and I
[53:47] believe it is then the third pull was
[53:49] the moving amen of the Revelation from
[53:52] the mind of God to the soul of the
[53:54] believer and you know God has only one
[53:57] provided way Amen to declare his word
[53:59] and the prophet said that way is by
[54:02] prophets he said he chose his way his
[54:04] word came and that was by His prophets
[54:07] which were predestinated and for
[54:09] ordained being a part of God's word he
[54:12] says declaring the revelation of his
[54:14] word to that age and that time amen so
[54:17] when Luther come he was declaring the
[54:20] word for the revelation of the time he
[54:22] was living when Wesley come he come de
[54:25] Dearing the Revelation amen and listen
[54:27] when the gifts were restored to
[54:28] Pentecost they were declaring that this
[54:31] is the restoration of the gifts amen but
[54:33] don't stop there amen God sent a prophet
[54:36] who had a Moses anointing as well as a
[54:39] Joshua anointing Amen to bring us out of
[54:41] confusion amen but to positionally place
[54:44] Us in the promised land with an
[54:47] inheritance amen I believe as the
[54:49] prophet said amen the the the preacher
[54:51] that God sends the prophet of God of the
[54:53] age he said he's not coming Amen to make
[54:56] a declaration that the church has made
[54:58] but he's coming to make a declaration
[55:00] that God has
[55:02] made he's not declaring what the church
[55:05] has to say he's declaring what God has
[55:07] to say Amen now watch a Vindicated
[55:10] Prophet 1951 he said I stand Here amen
[55:13] declaring the creator of the heavens and
[55:16] earth Jehovah God he said I claim to be
[55:18] a representative his in these last days
[55:21] Amen to bring a faith to his church amen
[55:25] 1964 he says in the name of Jesus Christ
[55:29] I take every spirit in here amen under
[55:31] my control now we got that memorized we
[55:34] got we got guys love to quote that amen
[55:37] cuz the next thing they want to do is
[55:38] perform themselves you know amen they
[55:40] want to try to reenact ay side or try to
[55:42] go off on this tangent amen but read the
[55:45] rest of the quote he said I take every
[55:47] spirit in here under my control Amen to
[55:50] declare the word of God see a prophet
[55:53] had to declare the word amen cuz he had
[55:56] to give the bride a place to stand amen
[55:58] you cannot stand upon the shifting Sands
[56:01] of man's ideas you cannot stand upon
[56:04] your feelings you cannot stand upon your
[56:06] sensation amen but when the revelation
[56:08] of the word of God comes into the church
[56:11] it gives a bride a place to stand and
[56:13] there's a place by me amen come stand on
[56:16] the rock of Revelation where heavens and
[56:18] earth will pass away but my word will
[56:21] never fail listen we're not standing on
[56:23] our feelings we're not standing on our
[56:25] emotions we're not standing on
[56:27] personalities we are standing on the
[56:29] rock of Revelation and when everything
[56:31] else fails this word Will Survive
[56:34] because it's the only thing that will
[56:35] overcome the age that we're living in is
[56:38] the word of God Amen now I believe and I
[56:41] believe we ought to take every spirit in
[56:43] here to declare the message of the hour
[56:45] sir yes sir now we have a responsibility
[56:48] you read do you believe that brother
[56:50] said everything is a responsibility he
[56:53] said that's hard to say but it's true
[56:55] amen that ministers many times Sher a
[56:58] responsibility amen for standing for the
[57:00] true word of God when they're confronted
[57:02] with it they'll Sher back that
[57:04] responsibility he said but when truth of
[57:06] the word of God is brought face to face
[57:09] with human beings we are prone to Sher
[57:11] back until the last resource another
[57:13] place you said the church before the
[57:15] church can ever be taken to Glory it has
[57:18] to go through amen the world of
[57:20] criticism amen and sometimes we try to
[57:23] Sherk amen or pull back from criticism
[57:27] listen if you're waiting on there to be
[57:28] no critics to do something for God
[57:31] you're never going to do anything for
[57:32] him at all as long as there's time as
[57:35] long as there's a devil loose there's
[57:37] always going to be a Critic brother Ron
[57:39] we can't preach it quite enough and
[57:41] there's going to be a Critic we can't
[57:42] preach it loud enough and there's going
[57:44] to be a Critic we can't sing it soft
[57:46] enough and there's going to are you
[57:47] hearing me there's always going to be
[57:49] critics amen but listen the critics are
[57:51] going to criticize in a ditch amen but
[57:54] there's a bride who is home with
[57:56] Christian Soldiers and they're marching
[57:58] through criticism they're marching
[58:00] through opinions they're marching
[58:01] through man's ideas and they are
[58:03] declaring this message is the only way
[58:06] out of time into eternity amen God
[58:08] forbid I ever Sher amen the job amen he
[58:12] said God forbid I ever Sher Amen Let me
[58:14] just go and say this God forbid amen
[58:17] that the ministry ever Sher amen
[58:19] preaching this message cuz there's a
[58:21] bunch of a bunch of reprobates on the
[58:22] internet that ain't got nothing else to
[58:24] do but sit around and surf services and
[58:27] criticize ay they going to put me on
[58:29] there so God bless you amen just go
[58:31] ahead and surf around and criticize this
[58:33] pastor brother Ron I've actually
[58:35] wondered do they have a job how do they
[58:37] pay their bills amen because I know we
[58:39] ain't paying them to sit there and
[58:40] critique this sermon and critique that
[58:43] well I'm feeling pretty good tonight he
[58:45] me it's a critical devil and it's going
[58:47] to be here till the change of our body
[58:49] but I want to announce you can criticize
[58:51] us all you want to but we're not
[58:53] shutting up and we're not clotting down
[58:55] and we're not backing off of this
[58:57] message if we got to stand by oursel
[58:59] we're going to declare this message is
[59:01] the return of the power of the
[59:04] resurrected Lord in the midst of the
[59:06] Church of the Living
[59:08] God we will not back up because of
[59:10] criticism we will not change because of
[59:13] criticism because we have a
[59:15] responsibility to declare in Acts 20: 27
[59:19] Paul says these words he says I have not
[59:21] shined Amen to declare unto you all
[59:24] somebody say all all the counsel of God
[59:27] Amen I love this word shine it means to
[59:30] draw back to let down to lower to with
[59:33] to withdraw it is of a timid person to
[59:35] withdraw oneself it is to be timid to
[59:38] cover listen it is of those who from
[59:40] Timothy hesitate to avow what they
[59:43] believe it is to be unwilling to utter
[59:46] from Fear amen so when Paul says this he
[59:49] said when the time come to declare the
[59:51] counsel and the the definition of
[59:53] counsel of God is purpose of God so Paul
[59:56] was declaring the purpose of God and the
[59:59] purpose of God is an eternal purpose
[1:00:01] according to Ephesians 3:11 right amen
[1:00:04] and then a prophet says amen that the
[1:00:06] purpose of God will never be defeated
[1:00:09] amen so that's why Paul did not come up
[1:00:11] against opposition when he was declaring
[1:00:14] the purpose of God and draw back because
[1:00:16] he knew the purpose of God would never
[1:00:19] be defeated listen to The Prophet woe
[1:00:22] unto me if I don't declare this counsil
[1:00:23] of God the people of his healing power
[1:00:26] and he's here yeah Christ the son of God
[1:00:30] is here to heal the sick and needy
[1:00:32] another place he said this divinely
[1:00:34] revealed amen by the Holy Spirit he said
[1:00:37] the same angel of God that directs me to
[1:00:39] see visions and so forth like that amen
[1:00:42] and the healing of the sick amen now
[1:00:44] watch a word Prophet is coming amen and
[1:00:47] he's declaring the nature of God he's
[1:00:49] declaring the thoughts of God can I say
[1:00:51] it like this he's even declaring the
[1:00:53] attitude of God
[1:00:55] the prophet of God said in the worst
[1:00:56] center in the city he said I told them
[1:00:58] Lord that you love them and you got the
[1:01:00] same respect for them that you did for
[1:01:03] that woman that night many years ago
[1:01:05] amen now here is a prophet amen it's in
[1:01:07] the message it is I Be not Afraid 54 he
[1:01:10] said breaking out of a human being he
[1:01:12] said and going into that Dimension
[1:01:14] listen who else stood in the pull pit
[1:01:17] amen and was preaching and broke out in
[1:01:19] a dimension of vision and said I can see
[1:01:21] Eve she's a blond-headed blue-eyed woman
[1:01:24] who else stood in the pull pit and broke
[1:01:26] out in vision and preached Adam and Eve
[1:01:29] leaving the garden with those bloody
[1:01:30] sheep skins hitting the back of their
[1:01:32] legs amen but a Vindicated word Prophet
[1:01:35] who was sent in this generation to
[1:01:37] declare the mind of God he said he
[1:01:40] cannot be a Healer once and not a Healer
[1:01:42] again he cannot be a god of Miracles one
[1:01:45] day and not a god of Miracles the next
[1:01:47] day for the Bible said he's the same
[1:01:49] yesterday today and forever amen the
[1:01:51] attitude of God is the same yesterday to
[1:01:54] today and forever he's still
[1:01:57] God he's still God Amen and if you'll
[1:02:00] take the right mental attitude towards
[1:02:02] any promise when that when you read it
[1:02:04] on the Bible it's the truth no matter
[1:02:06] how many tries to put it on another age
[1:02:09] or it's in the past age or it's an age
[1:02:11] that's in the future he never did
[1:02:13] declare he was the I was amen he's the I
[1:02:17] am always he did not come in this
[1:02:20] generation and declare I was or I will
[1:02:23] be now come on Church
[1:02:24] amen cuz we've had a lot of guys put it
[1:02:26] back in the past amen or put it so far
[1:02:28] in the future that nobody can obtain it
[1:02:31] amen but I want to declare to you 1 John
[1:02:33] 3 says beloved

[1:03:40] going to preach it's not just happen in
[1:03:42] one man's Ministry amen this bride's
[1:03:45] Revival is a word born Revival then
[1:03:48] wherever the devil is put in subjection
[1:03:50] and the message has Liberty there's a
[1:03:53] Revival burning in The Bride of Jesus
[1:03:55] Christ and there ain't sickness stopping
[1:03:57] it there ain't devil stopping it because
[1:03:59] it didn't come from a man it come from
[1:04:01] the word don't you ever let some devil
[1:04:04] tell you this word reev this bride's
[1:04:06] Revival is a bunch of emotion or a bunch
[1:04:08] of fanaticism the bride's Revival is the
[1:04:13] word now do those things come with it
[1:04:15] they do but that's not the sign of
[1:04:17] Revival the sign of Revival is the word
[1:04:20] has been revealed and there's a people
[1:04:23] who's come to the revelation it belongs
[1:04:25] to me now watch what Paul writes to
[1:04:27] Timothy he says Timothy preach the word
[1:04:30] in other words Timothy whenever you get
[1:04:33] a pull pit preach the
[1:04:35] word whenever God opens a door Timothy
[1:04:38] just preach the word don't stand there
[1:04:40] and tell about your problems and tell
[1:04:42] about who don't like you and who's
[1:04:44] against you but no just stand there and
[1:04:46] preach the word Timothy be instant in
[1:04:49] season out of season reprove and rebuke
[1:04:51] exhort with all longsuffering and doct
[1:04:54] amen preach that word preach means to
[1:04:56] Proclaim after the manner of a Herald it
[1:04:59] always with the suggestion of formality
[1:05:02] gravity and Authority which must be
[1:05:04] listened to and obeyed so Timothy has
[1:05:07] said stand there and declare the word
[1:05:09] and don't declare it half-heartedly
[1:05:11] don't declare it without your whole soul
[1:05:13] into it amen but declare it with such
[1:05:16] Authority that somebody will hear it and
[1:05:18] somebody will believe it and somebody
[1:05:20] will obey it amen preach the word
[1:05:23] Timothy publish it Proclaim it openly
[1:05:25] amen something which has been done now
[1:05:28] brother says we ministers we have orders
[1:05:30] from you Lord preach the word that's why
[1:05:33] they call us Full Gospel preachers it's
[1:05:36] because we preach the whole word the
[1:05:38] whole counsel of God now don't get mad
[1:05:41] at me but this message is not a buffet
[1:05:44] that's right the message of the hour is
[1:05:46] not a buffet it's not a take what you
[1:05:49] want and leave what you don't and well I
[1:05:51] don't like that no it's a seven course
[1:05:53] meal
[1:05:54] which means whatever is set in front of
[1:05:56] you has already been deboned there's no
[1:05:59] seeds in it it's pure word and if you'll
[1:06:03] feed on it it'll have the same effect
[1:06:05] upon you that it did upon those that
[1:06:07] were walking the road of emus when he
[1:06:09] stepped in the little room and begin to
[1:06:11] break the bread and their eyes come open
[1:06:14] and they seen that this is he that was
[1:06:16] dead but he's alive forever more and
[1:06:19] there's a bride on the earth tonight who
[1:06:21] has stepped in the little room and she's
[1:06:23] feeding on the bread of his presence and
[1:06:25] her eyes have come open that he's not in
[1:06:28] a tomb in Jerusalem he's not in a grave
[1:06:30] in Jeffersonville but he's right here
[1:06:32] tonight in the power of his resurrection
[1:06:35] performing his word manifesting his
[1:06:37] presence because he is
[1:06:40] here we must preach the whole word the
[1:06:43] whole counsel of God I'll just say this
[1:06:46] our preaching the message and believing
[1:06:49] of the message it must be free from
[1:06:52] Prejudice you say preach preacher why
[1:06:54] you saying that well Prejudice is it's
[1:06:56] an irrational attitude of hostility
[1:06:59] directed against an individual a group a
[1:07:01] race or their supposed characteristics
[1:07:04] now do you realize that the Pharisees
[1:07:07] and the Sadducees accuse Jesus of
[1:07:09] prejudice they said listen amen you got
[1:07:12] Prejudice remember said the reason they
[1:07:13] said that is because he didn't join up
[1:07:16] with their group he said but if you had
[1:07:17] come and said are you Pharisees are
[1:07:19] wrong and I'm a sadducee are you
[1:07:21] Sadducees are wrong and I'm a Pharisee
[1:07:24] then the Pharisee would have said I told
[1:07:25] you we were right but he didn't come to
[1:07:28] any of them come on Church the Sadducees
[1:07:30] was in a ditch and the Pharisees was in
[1:07:33] a ditch but he didn't come to either of
[1:07:35] them the prophet said he stood between
[1:07:38] them glory to God he stood between the
[1:07:41] Pharisees he stood between the Sadducees
[1:07:44] and he pulled the elected seed out of
[1:07:46] the confusion of saguy and confusion the
[1:07:49] Pharisees and he pulled a group to the
[1:07:51] middle of the road and they walked with
[1:07:53] the same Authority the same Authority
[1:07:55] that was on him was upon them who was in
[1:07:58] the middle of the road oh church amen I
[1:08:01] love this the Vindicated prophets
[1:08:02] preaching is free from Prejudice yes
[1:08:06] it's free from natural Prejudice it's
[1:08:08] free from spiritual Prejudice he was not
[1:08:11] here as some angry preacher trying to
[1:08:13] find somebody to H to preach at amen he
[1:08:16] was here declaring the thoughts of God
[1:08:18] to the church amen in the Rapture
[1:08:20] message he said you're not blind people
[1:08:23] you're sensible people and if I stood
[1:08:25] here and said those things for prejudice
[1:08:27] I say it because it's life I say it
[1:08:30] because I'm responsible to God for
[1:08:32] saying it and I must say it somebody say
[1:08:34] he must say it he must say it and my
[1:08:37] message all the time knowing backf there
[1:08:40] under healing and so forth like that was
[1:08:42] just to catch the people's attention
[1:08:45] brother Ronnie just takes us all the way
[1:08:46] back to the first pool and the second
[1:08:48] pool and said that was to catch the
[1:08:51] people's attention but called it one
[1:08:53] place he called it preparation years to
[1:08:56] catch the people's attention he said
[1:08:58] because I knew that the message would
[1:09:00] come so the third pull was the message
[1:09:03] of the hour to pull the bride to the
[1:09:06] balance of the word of God he says and
[1:09:09] here it is amen knowing the message
[1:09:11] would come 1965 Rapture he says and here
[1:09:14] it is so brother Robert is no longer on
[1:09:17] his way he has now taken his Liberty to
[1:09:20] declare what was coming is now here
[1:09:24] here it is see and them Seven Seals open
[1:09:27] them Mysteries amen showing those things
[1:09:30] of what's happened now when I say like
[1:09:31] this when the Revelation broke when the
[1:09:34] Revelation began to break amen a prophet
[1:09:37] could not hold back amen the Bible says
[1:09:39] in Matthew 13:11 amen Jesus said unto
[1:09:42] them it is given unto you to know the
[1:09:45] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[1:09:47] to them it is not given so that so Jesus
[1:09:51] could not hold back a prophet could can
[1:09:53] not hold back amen and neither as we the
[1:09:56] disciples can hold back on the
[1:09:58] Revelation that's been revealed to us he
[1:10:01] said and doing this I've come here for
[1:10:02] the purpose of teaching the last vows
[1:10:05] the last seven vows and the last seven
[1:10:07] trumpets and the last seven thunders of
[1:10:09] the Book of Revelation tying them
[1:10:11] together in this hour that we're now
[1:10:12] living to follow amen the opening of The
[1:10:15] Seven Seals the seven Church ages he
[1:10:18] said and by this it's not appointed to
[1:10:20] any certain person Creeds whatever it
[1:10:22] might be it's just as I see God's word
[1:10:25] and last Sunday we had a very fine
[1:10:27] outpouring of the spirit upon the word
[1:10:29] so brother Brandon was not preaching a
[1:10:31] bunch of a bunch of lectures amen but he
[1:10:33] would preach the word and because the
[1:10:36] spirit follows the word there would be
[1:10:38] an outpouring of spirit upon the
[1:10:41] word now come on I believe our services
[1:10:43] ought to build amen I believe our
[1:10:45] services ought to build from the bottom
[1:10:47] to the top every service but let me say
[1:10:49] this I don't think our worship amen
[1:10:51] should quiet when we get to the word I I
[1:10:53] don't think our shouts and amens amen
[1:10:55] ought to get ought to calm down when it
[1:10:57] comes to the word amen if there ought to
[1:10:58] be a time to shout it ought to be about
[1:11:01] the word if we're going to dance about
[1:11:03] something let's dance about the word if
[1:11:05] come on church amen listen and I'll say
[1:11:07] like this the message of the hour is the
[1:11:10] only place you can go with liberty and
[1:11:13] respond to God's word the way he called
[1:11:15] you to
[1:11:17] respond are you hearing me in the middle
[1:11:19] of the road there's liberty you know
[1:11:21] what brother Ron in the middle of the
[1:11:22] road amen there's liberty to say Amen if
[1:11:25] you're an amen or if you're a loud vocal
[1:11:27] amener there's liberty to stand up and
[1:11:29] just shout amen but if you're not a loud
[1:11:32] vocal amener and you're just one that
[1:11:34] sits there and receives the word amen
[1:11:36] there's liberty to sit there and receive
[1:11:37] the word if you're a shouter there's
[1:11:40] liberty to shout if you're a runner
[1:11:42] there's liberty to run if you're a
[1:11:43] dancer there's liberty to dance if
[1:11:45] you're a teacher of the fivefold
[1:11:47] ministry there's liberty to teach if
[1:11:49] you're a preacher there's liberty to
[1:11:50] preach if you're an evangelist there's
[1:11:52] liberty to evangelize if you're a pastor
[1:11:55] there's liberty to are you hearing me
[1:11:56] because it's the only place we're not
[1:11:58] here Amen to force everybody to worship
[1:12:01] a certain way under a certain direction
[1:12:04] under a certain atmosphere the only
[1:12:06] atmosphere that belongs in a message
[1:12:08] church is a creative atmosphere that has
[1:12:10] come from a creative word that is
[1:12:12] packing a creative power that will
[1:12:14] manifest the creation of God by the
[1:12:17] spoken word that's the only atmosphere
[1:12:20] that belongs in the message church is a
[1:12:22] created atmosphere yes sir not a
[1:12:24] man-made
[1:12:25] atmosphere a creative atmosphere see so
[1:12:29] in other words Jesus did not give his
[1:12:30] disciples amen private interpretation
[1:12:33] because private interpretation it does
[1:12:36] not loose it
[1:12:38] binds now youall know what the Bible
[1:12:40] says don't you this first that no
[1:12:43] Prophecy of the scripture is of any
[1:12:45] private interpretation look at this word
[1:12:47] prophecy it's a discourse emanating from
[1:12:50] divine inspiration and declaring the
[1:12:53] purposes of
[1:12:55] God glory to God so when you're
[1:12:58] preaching this message it's prophetic
[1:13:00] word so you're actually prophesying
[1:13:03] Revelation 10 you're actually
[1:13:04] prophesying the word again look at this
[1:13:07] word interpretation brother brother
[1:13:09] interpretation is a loosening it's to
[1:13:11] unloose something so when something is
[1:13:14] interpreted amen now watch if it's a
[1:13:16] private interpretation let's just go and
[1:13:19] say it it came from the serpent which
[1:13:21] was Eve's interpreter and that
[1:13:23] interpretation binds now you say brother
[1:13:25] Andrew you better be careful cuz brother
[1:13:27] so and so privately interpreted this to
[1:13:29] me and I'll tell you what it's it's a
[1:13:31] powerful interpretation well let's not
[1:13:33] put it on brother so and so's head let's
[1:13:35] put it back on The Interpreter of Eve
[1:13:37] which was Lucifer because he's the he's
[1:13:40] the father of all private
[1:13:42] interpretation he's the father of all
[1:13:44] false interpretation and it comes in to
[1:13:47] take out the liberty and to bring us
[1:13:49] under a certain direction under a
[1:13:51] certain Ministry come on church amen but
[1:13:53] true inspiration it does not come from
[1:13:56] Lucifer it comes from the spirit of
[1:13:58] Truth and when true interpretation
[1:14:01] begins to break out in the church it
[1:14:03] begins to move the church from bondage
[1:14:05] unto Victory from bondage unto Liberty
[1:14:08] now you know what the devil does not
[1:14:09] want the devil does not want the Great
[1:14:11] Commission of Mark 16 to be preached
[1:14:14] because that commission says go ye into
[1:14:16] all the world and preach the gospel and
[1:14:19] says cast out Devils now you know what
[1:14:22] the prophet of God said he said the
[1:14:24] preaching of the word is the casting out
[1:14:26] of the devil when the word is preached
[1:14:29] the preaching of the word cast out the
[1:14:31] devil now why does the preach of the
[1:14:33] word cast out the devil to bring a
[1:14:35] liberty to the seat of God Amen to
[1:14:37] believe the word without private
[1:14:39] interpretation but true interpretation
[1:14:42] you know what sometimes you you see your
[1:14:44] pastor up here or your or your ministers
[1:14:46] up here laboring under the word you know
[1:14:48] what they're doing they're they're in
[1:14:49] spiritual warfare right because
[1:14:52] preaching a amen is spiritual warfare
[1:14:55] but I want to say this tonight we don't
[1:14:57] quit come on preachers we don't quit
[1:15:00] amen the Bible says it like this amen we
[1:15:02] have come to Mount Zion under the city
[1:15:05] of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem
[1:15:07] Amen to an innumerable company of angels
[1:15:10] do you know why we do not quit amen
[1:15:12] because we're accompanied at the pull
[1:15:14] pit amen by the angels of God the
[1:15:17] prophet said in Junction of time he says
[1:15:19] Angels appear in the end time and if God
[1:15:21] did that for those little Junctions back
[1:15:23] fair then what will he do now when all
[1:15:26] hell is turned loose when all hell is
[1:15:28] turned loose all heaven will turn loose
[1:15:31] Angels appear signs and wonders on the
[1:15:33] earth now watch this the counterfeits AR
[1:15:36] Rising amen but God is proven which is
[1:15:39] right and which is wrong now when you
[1:15:41] start talking about counterfeits how can
[1:15:43] you not go back to the book of Timothy
[1:15:45] where Paul says amen as jambers and
[1:15:48] jambers wied Moses amen so do these men
[1:15:51] of corrupt mind reprobate concerning the
[1:15:54] truth amen watch amen but the Bible says
[1:15:57] their Folly shall be made manifest unto
[1:16:00] all men as theirs also was why would the
[1:16:03] prophet of God pick this up in spoken
[1:16:05] word Original Seed he said as they
[1:16:07] wisted Moses in the last days they would
[1:16:10] reappear those Spirits again so the
[1:16:13] spirits of Janice and jambers would
[1:16:15] reappear again what just before the
[1:16:19] liberation of the people he says
[1:16:21] hallelujah The Liberation time is here
[1:16:24] and they would exceed the very elect if
[1:16:26] it was possible he said but it's not
[1:16:28] possible because the word is the truth
[1:16:32] what did Paul tell Timothy to preach he
[1:16:34] said Timothy preach the word and if
[1:16:36] you'll preach this message it'll discern
[1:16:39] the false it'll discern the true and
[1:16:41] it'll bring a liberty to the seat of God
[1:16:44] to manifest the power of God in their
[1:16:46] lives I just believe it friends I
[1:16:48] believe in the ministry of
[1:16:50] angels I believe what Paul said he said
[1:16:52] there ministering spirits that have been
[1:16:54] sent from the presence of God to
[1:16:56] minister to those who are The Heirs of
[1:16:59] Salvation you say preacher what do you
[1:17:01] getting that probably God said may
[1:17:02] angels of God just hover as it was the
[1:17:05] audience amen day after day night after
[1:17:08] night until there will not be a sick or
[1:17:10] feeble person in our midst he said now
[1:17:13] if I fail Lord I don't mean to but I
[1:17:15] pray that you'll help me and help me to
[1:17:17] pray a prayer of faith for the sick and
[1:17:19] needy and help me to explain Thy Word in
[1:17:22] such a way that the people would believe
[1:17:24] on thy beloved Son and be healed and
[1:17:27] saved do you realize church that there's
[1:17:29] an angel in this Pulpit tonight helping
[1:17:31] me deliver this word I literally believe
[1:17:34] there's an angel here amen helping me
[1:17:36] preach the word I believe there's an
[1:17:38] angel that accompanies your pastor to
[1:17:40] the pullit and helps him preach the word
[1:17:42] but can I say this the same Angel that's
[1:17:45] helping the preacher preach it is the
[1:17:47] same Angels that's helping you to
[1:17:49] believe
[1:17:50] it the same angels that's helping them
[1:17:54] to deliver it and declare it is the same
[1:17:56] angels helping you to believe it
[1:17:58] remember said may your angels take their
[1:18:00] position in places positionally Out
[1:18:02] Among the People speaking to their
[1:18:04] hearts amen getting them to believe he
[1:18:06] says take away all unbelief another
[1:18:09] place now you feel real odd and strange
[1:18:11] but that's nothing in the world but the
[1:18:13] angel of the Lord amen moving on this
[1:18:16] side that's exactly what it is it's
[1:18:18] coming to me now see now it's not to
[1:18:20] hurt you it's to help you to get you to
[1:18:23] believe in what amen Jesus Christ amen
[1:18:26] that's the only thing it can do so the
[1:18:28] angel is not there to hurt you the
[1:18:31] Angels there to influence you to believe
[1:18:33] that Jesus Christ has been declared
[1:18:35] presently by the seventh angel he's
[1:18:39] here the pr of God goes on another place
[1:18:42] he said may the great Powers may the
[1:18:44] great angels that now listen this that
[1:18:46] rolled away the stone Amen on Easter
[1:18:48] morning may they stand present today to
[1:18:51] roll away every Stone of Doubt of fear
[1:18:55] every Discord take it from the people's
[1:18:57] heart amen the same angel that equipped
[1:19:00] Martha to roll away the stone amen from
[1:19:03] the from the tomb and let Lazarus come
[1:19:05] out is the same angel that a prophet was
[1:19:08] invited in the meeting to stand by the
[1:19:10] heart of the believer amen and roll away
[1:19:13] the stone of fear roll away the stone of
[1:19:15] Doubt roll away the stone of Discord
[1:19:17] that the people might be able to believe
[1:19:20] what's being declared amen can I move a
[1:19:22] step further further Paul says I've not
[1:19:24] shunned to declare unto you all the
[1:19:27] counsel of God that word shunned amen is
[1:19:30] to be unwilling to utter from Fear do
[1:19:32] you realize the prophet says that one of
[1:19:34] the greatest curses on the church today
[1:19:37] is
[1:19:38] fear one of the greatest chur curses on
[1:19:41] the church today is fear Everybody's
[1:19:43] scared to death here's what it is what's
[1:19:45] going to happen who what y'all know what
[1:19:47] I'm talking about come on the world's
[1:19:49] full of fear but let me say this natural
[1:19:52] fear come comes in a church and becomes
[1:19:54] a spiritual fear but the Bible tells us
[1:19:56] amen
[1:19:58] 365 times Be not
[1:20:00] Afraid fear not see Jesus himself stood
[1:20:04] and said fear not little flock it's your
[1:20:06] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:20:09] kingdom brother says what is the kingdom
[1:20:11] he says it's the word made Power so it's
[1:20:14] the father's Good Will to give you the
[1:20:17] word made Power in 2 Timothy 1:7 he said
[1:20:21] God hath not given us the spirit of fear
[1:20:24] but of power and of love and of a sound
[1:20:26] mind you know what love is it's a
[1:20:28] powerful force there's nothing more
[1:20:30] strong than love love will make you
[1:20:32] trust love has no fear love cast out
[1:20:36] fear and one of the greatest things I
[1:20:38] find among them is fear and what makes
[1:20:40] them fear is a lack of
[1:20:43] confidence a lack of confidence brings a
[1:20:46] spirit of fear he said if you if you
[1:20:48] lack confidence it'll make you fear but
[1:20:51] you know what I believe I I believe we
[1:20:53] have been called Amen to declare the
[1:20:55] message of the hour amen with liberty
[1:20:57] and rebuke the spirit of
[1:21:00] fear come on church God delivers by his
[1:21:04] word the Bible says you've not received
[1:21:07] the spirit of bondage again the fear but
[1:21:09] you have received the spirit of adoption
[1:21:12] whereby we cry AB Our Father brother
[1:21:15] said that there he died and he sent back
[1:21:16] the Holy Spirit and he said to the
[1:21:18] church amen take this and follow me and
[1:21:21] fight with it he said the greatest
[1:21:23] weapon was ever put in the hands of man
[1:21:26] is the Bible Amen to be backed up with
[1:21:28] the Holy Ghost amen that Christ died at
[1:21:31] Calvary to free his church I believe
[1:21:34] that Christ died at Calvary to liberate
[1:21:37] his church to free his church from
[1:21:40] superstitions and fear and doubt and
[1:21:42] trembling he lives today he rose from
[1:21:45] the grave I'm turning the corner here
[1:21:47] and closing because I believe that fear
[1:21:49] is
[1:21:50] real but let me say this to you fear is
[1:21:53] a spirit it's a spirit of intimidation
[1:21:56] and it's a spirit of manipulation it
[1:21:59] begins intimidation brother jonan then
[1:22:01] it moves into manipulation but watch
[1:22:04] this amen What Fear will do is it will
[1:22:06] intimidate you and then when it gets you
[1:22:08] all scared and all backed up then it
[1:22:11] begins to manipulate you now if you
[1:22:12] don't believe me just look at
[1:22:15] Co are you with me amen I believe Co was
[1:22:18] a real germ a real virus that come out
[1:22:20] of a lab come I believe it's real I'm
[1:22:22] not a conspirac okay I believe it was
[1:22:24] real but let me say this what I believe
[1:22:27] become more real was the fear of Co than
[1:22:30] the actual germ of Co because somebody
[1:22:32] got on the Airways and said there's a
[1:22:35] virus and it's coming to the country
[1:22:36] amen and people got so scared and they
[1:22:39] got so intimidated now watch amen it
[1:22:42] intimidated them and then it began to
[1:22:43] manipulate our ways of life amen instead
[1:22:46] of going to the office we stayed home
[1:22:48] instead of going to church we had to
[1:22:51] stream come on y'all know I'm telling
[1:22:53] the truth brother brother Robert we
[1:22:55] never went to Walmart and wore a three
[1:22:58] masks we are you with me amen we we we
[1:23:01] never left our groceries out on the
[1:23:03] front porch and sprayed them down with
[1:23:05] LOL before we brought them in amen but a
[1:23:07] but a spirit of fear which was real
[1:23:09] begin to intimidate and then begin to
[1:23:11] manipulate our ways of life but let me
[1:23:14] say this amen there's a spirit of fear
[1:23:16] in the last days and I tell you where it
[1:23:18] come from it come from the pits of hell
[1:23:20] and it's trying to manipulate this bride
[1:23:22] it's trying to intimidate the ministry
[1:23:24] it's trying to change the way we worship
[1:23:26] it's trying to change the way we preach
[1:23:28] the message it's trying to say we're
[1:23:30] going to get out of balance it's trying
[1:23:31] to say we can't believe this and we
[1:23:33] can't go here but let me say this that
[1:23:35] same spirit of fear is of the devil and
[1:23:38] there's a bride on the earth tonight who
[1:23:40] will not be intimidated you will not
[1:23:42] manipulate our preaching you will not

[1:23:51] we have been liberated by the Oh Glory
[1:23:54] to God we have been liberated by the
[1:23:56] message of the hour by the seventh angel
[1:23:59] who declared the whole Council of God
[1:24:01] has brought up full Liberty to the
[1:24:03] church listen to this and I'm closing so
[1:24:06] don't fear fear is of the
[1:24:10] devil don't fear fear is of the devil
[1:24:14] are you with me now he said everything
[1:24:16] Jesus would say was fear not constantly
[1:24:19] fear not fear not see God don't want you
[1:24:23] to fear he wants you to believe so he
[1:24:27] sent an angel in the Pulpit to preach he
[1:24:30] sent an angel in the building to
[1:24:31] influence you to
[1:24:33] believe he does not want you to fear he
[1:24:37] wants you to believe so every one of you
[1:24:40] believe with one Accord every one of you
[1:24:43] can I close on this point in Matthew
[1:24:45] 14:22 the Bible says that straightway
[1:24:48] Jesus he constrained his disciples to
[1:24:50] get into a ship and to to go before him
[1:24:53] unto the other side while he sent the
[1:24:55] multitude away and when he had sent the
[1:24:57] multitudes away he went up into a
[1:24:59] mountain apart to pray and when the
[1:25:01] evening was come he was there alone but
[1:25:04] the ship was now in the midst of the sea
[1:25:07] and it was tossed with waves for the
[1:25:10] wind was contrary I'm not going to slow
[1:25:12] down and preach it but I'm going to say
[1:25:13] this am I'm I'm I'm I'm bringing a to to
[1:25:16] you amen the wind was contrary if you go
[1:25:19] to Ephesians 4 the Bible says the time
[1:25:21] will come they're tossed about to and
[1:25:23] fro right and it says this amen they'll
[1:25:26] be carried about with every wind of
[1:25:29] Doctrine I preach the message one time
[1:25:31] Amen on there's a wind advisory in
[1:25:33] effect in the last days amen there's a
[1:25:35] wind advisory amen there's been a wind
[1:25:37] of this Doctrine and a wind of that
[1:25:39] Doctrine amen but watch verse 25 it was
[1:25:42] the fourth watch of the night when Jesus
[1:25:45] went unto them walking on the sea says
[1:25:48] it is I 1960 he says Revelation 17:15
[1:25:51] says that the waters which thou sawest
[1:25:54] amen is sickness and multitude to the
[1:25:56] people when the disciples saw him amen
[1:25:59] walking on the sea they were troubled
[1:26:02] saying amen it is a spirit now watch and
[1:26:05] they cried out for fear brother Russell
[1:26:08] here they're in a storm the ship is
[1:26:11] rocking the winds are blowing and here
[1:26:14] comes Jesus amen walking on the water
[1:26:17] and they cry out for fear and say it's a
[1:26:19] spirit but straightway Jesus spake unto
[1:26:21] them and said be of good
[1:26:25] cheer it is I Be not Afraid are you
[1:26:29] hearing me here comes Jesus walking on
[1:26:31] the water brother Robert said here's
[1:26:34] what happened he said they was down to
[1:26:36] nothing he said the ores were broke the
[1:26:38] boat was falling apart they needed help
[1:26:42] are you with me they needed help and you
[1:26:44] say brother Andrew how can you use that
[1:26:45] for today he said in Jehovah gyus 64
[1:26:48] today people are something on the order
[1:26:51] like they was in the day days when the
[1:26:53] disciples Was Out on the Ocean a
[1:26:55] nightstorm came up there was nothing all
[1:26:57] hopes was gone and they seen him come

[1:27:06] another screaming and they looked out
[1:27:08] there and seen him come walking on the
[1:27:10] water and they were scared of him their
[1:27:13] only hope they were afraid of the only
[1:27:16] thing that could save them if that ain't
[1:27:18] a true picture today again brother Bram
[1:27:20] says it like this he says they looked at
[1:27:22] him and said it's spooky you know they
[1:27:24] said they cried out for fear now watch
[1:27:27] if you'll just look like they did when
[1:27:28] they cried out but then they heard a
[1:27:30] voice Oh Glory but then they heard a
[1:27:34] voice here they are in the middle of a
[1:27:36] storm they're in confusion fear is
[1:27:38] filling their hearts fear has filled the
[1:27:41] ship they don't know what to go amen the
[1:27:43] fear is intimidated them and it's now
[1:27:45] manipulating them but then all of a
[1:27:47] sudden brother Ron here come one walking
[1:27:50] on the water and they looked at him and
[1:27:52] they said he's spooky but then they
[1:27:54] heard a
[1:27:55] voice Oh Glory then they heard a voice I
[1:27:59] don't know about you amen but I remember
[1:28:01] when I was on the ship and everything
[1:28:03] was falling apart and I didn't know what
[1:28:05] would save me I didn't know what would
[1:28:07] give me some Liberty but then all of a
[1:28:09] sudden I heard a
[1:28:12] voice and it said fear not it is high Be
[1:28:15] not Afraid amen be of good courage amen
[1:28:19] I'm closing on this point right here
[1:28:21] when he rebukes the fear he replaced it
[1:28:23] with courage when he rebuked the fear he
[1:28:27] replaced the fear with courage and said
[1:28:29] do not be feared do not be fearful but
[1:28:32] be strong and be of good courage he said

[1:28:49] on the people he's walking in the church
[1:28:51] and he's saying it's
[1:28:55] me when a prophet began to declare the
[1:28:58] Revelation and it looked a little bit

[1:29:50] prophet he said the only thing that can
[1:29:52] bring the church back together and take
[1:29:54] the
[1:29:57] Rapture they say it's fortune telling
[1:30:00] it's be elub when the very thing he said
[1:30:03] he would do as it was then so it is now
[1:30:06] but what did he say then he said I wish
[1:30:08] I had a little longer but I haven't but
[1:30:10] what did he say then be not afraid be of
[1:30:14] good cheer it is I are y'all ready for
[1:30:17] this Hallelujah are you ready for a
[1:30:19] prophet to break out Beyond Humanity

[1:30:30] is I Be not Afraid Be not Afraid
[1:30:34] now it is I be of good cheer be of good
[1:30:38] courage build yourself
[1:30:41] [Music]

[1:30:46] yourself up to give you an inheritance
[1:30:48] among them which are Sanctified here
[1:30:50] Jesus is saying to you build yourself up
[1:30:52] I've got my eye on you I'm watching you
[1:30:55] I'm coming into the midst of the
[1:30:57] assembly into the midst of the Church of
[1:30:59] God and I'm coming in here to do what to
[1:31:01] take out the elected not to make another
[1:31:04] organization but a Rapture to go
[1:31:08] home he's coming to pull from both sides
[1:31:11] to the middle of the road where there's
[1:31:13] some Liberty to lay in the presence of
[1:31:15] the Sun and let all the greenness bake
[1:31:17] out of us and take us
[1:31:20] home he said today it's the same thing
[1:31:22] they're afraid to take a hold of the
[1:31:23] Holy Spirit they're afraid to believe
[1:31:26] God's message they're afraid to believe
[1:31:28] the Holy Spirit when they see it working
[1:31:29] among them but can I say this church the
[1:31:33] days of holding back and preaching or
[1:31:36] declaring or believing this message are
[1:31:39] over they're over proud of God said we
[1:31:42] need men of God who won't hold back he
[1:31:44] said what we need today is men we need
[1:31:46] gospel preachers and any preacher will
[1:31:48] stand in the pull pit and hold back on
[1:31:49] those things I got little respect of him
[1:31:52] being called a
[1:31:54] God are you hearing
[1:31:56] me listen as you stand to your feet with
[1:32:00] me
[1:32:01] tonight I believe he's come
[1:32:05] down can I ask you this question brother
[1:32:08] Warren when they was in the ship the
[1:32:12] wind was was blowing the cils were broke
[1:32:14] the ores were broke everything was
[1:32:16] falling apart and their lives are
[1:32:18] filling up with
[1:32:20] fear and Here Comes Jesus brother Greg
[1:32:24] Here Comes Jesus walking on the water
[1:32:27] and he sees him in that condition they
[1:32:29] look at him and they become afraid of
[1:32:31] him can I ask you this how did he rebuke
[1:32:35] the
[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:37] fear he declared his
[1:32:41] presence Hallelujah it is
[1:32:44] I Be not
[1:32:47] [Music]
[1:32:49] Afraid now I don't know about y'all but
[1:32:51] I know right now the world's falling
[1:32:54] apart and I want to say this I believe
[1:32:57] the hour has come that we ought to have
[1:32:59] some Believers in stability of what a
[1:33:01] prophet
[1:33:03] taught I'll just be honest with you

[1:33:11] actually got moved by the as bear
[1:33:12] Revival around this message oh God's
[1:33:16] moving God's moving brother Andrew and I
[1:33:18] asked one brother I said brother I said

[1:33:38] here but let's just say what a prophet
[1:33:40] said he said you mean you could see and
[1:33:43] hear the word preached and see God turn
[1:33:45] around and say the word is the truth
[1:33:47] that's me that's me I'm standing here
[1:33:50] the very God that that's going to judge
[1:33:52] you and then hold back he said don't you
[1:33:55] do it you might cut yourself off
[1:33:58] forever Lord can I ask you tonight what
[1:34:02] fear has got you holding things

[1:34:20] said has your spirit said amen to it
[1:34:22] it's been fulfilled in your life then
[1:34:24] don't you hold back something well my

[1:34:50] about that but but guess what we're
[1:34:52] talking about we're talking about a
[1:34:54] seventh Angel's message that come in
[1:34:57] this age and declared the presence of
[1:34:59] Jesus Christ and said before one bomb
[1:35:01] ever hits this

[1:35:05] supper of the
[1:35:06] Lamb

[1:40:50] he is is a resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:40:53] walking on the road to
[1:40:55] emus and they miss his
[1:40:58] appearing but he broke the bread and
[1:41:00] guess what he did he opened their eyes
[1:41:02] of
[1:41:04] understanding it is
[1:41:06] I Be not Afraid is it not written that I
[1:41:10] had to do this and this and this these
[1:41:13] scriptures had to be fulfilled and he
[1:41:15] began to go back to the Books of Moses
[1:41:19] and the Commandments and said this had
[1:41:21] to be fulfilled in this huh Hallelujah
[1:41:25] so we're seeing God right here
[1:41:28] fulfilling his word thank you Lord and
