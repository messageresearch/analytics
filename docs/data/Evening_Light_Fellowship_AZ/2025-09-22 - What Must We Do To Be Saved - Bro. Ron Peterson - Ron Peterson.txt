Man, I had this uh this song kind of came on my heart this week. Um talking about Charlie Kirk. Um I think my wife would tell you that um him getting killed got um kind of messed me up more than I thought it would or more than I'd care to admit. um because I really enjoyed um listening to his what he would say and I think more so just the example and the character um of his life. And so thinking through all that um the song came on my heart um we can put our trust in a lot of different things but at the end of the day there's only one thing that's not going to fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um so I wanted to sing this just again because it came on my heart and it seemed real appropriate. On Christ the solid rock I stand. All other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. [Music] My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness. I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but holy lean on Jesus name. On Christ the solid rock I stand. All other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. When darkness seems to hide his face, I rest on his unchanging grace. In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil. On Christ the solid rock I stand. All other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. [Music] His oath is covenant and his blood support me in the whelming flood. When all around my soul gives way, he then is all my hope and stay. On Christ the solid rock I stand. All other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. when he shall come with trumpet sound. Oh, may I then be found dressed in his rightousness alone, fallless to stand before the throne. And he shall come with trumpet sound. Oh, may I then in him be found, dressed in his righteousness alone, faultless to stand before the throne. On Christ the solid rock I stand. All other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. On Christ the solid rock I stand. All other ground is sinking sand. All other ground is sinking sand. and turn [Music] your eyes upon Jesus. Look for in his wonderful face. And the things of earth will grow strange [Music] dim in the light of his glory and grace. Sing it with me. Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus.

Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's been a while since I've been up here. Um, I thank everybody for praying for my eyes. Uh, God's been good. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. When you guys come in that door there, when I shake your hand and greet you, I always say, "It's good to see you." I mean that literally. &gt;&gt; It's been a journey &gt;&gt; through this whole process, but God's been good. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we go through trials and [Music] going through these trials, especially with with for me for vision things. It's been a kind of a lifelong thing and I trust God. But yet, there's still times I I got discouraged. I'll be quite honest with you. But you know what? I've determined that I am a son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; We have a privilege to ask what we have need of. &gt;&gt; We need to realize who we are. &gt;&gt; God is good all the time. &gt;&gt; Hope the song blesses you. [Music] There have been times that I thought my prayers didn't even reach the ceiling of the room where I now to pray. And a voice inside kept asking me, "Did you think God was really listening to anything that I had to say?" [Music] But I kept on praying, holding on by faith, knowing God, he is always in control. And I waited like a rose bud in the garden cuz only God can unfold the rose. [Music] When God unfolds the rose, he always gets it right. when the petals are in place. [Music] Oh, it's such a beautiful sight. God knows when to hold on and the perfect time to let go. [Music] So let him have his way [Music] and let God unfold the roles. There are trials and tribulations we must all go through. When it comes the heartaches, we've all had our share. When times are the hardest, we need to hold on to the promise. He said he never give us more than we could bear. So I'll keep on praying, holding on by faith, knowing God is working all things for my good. And I'll wait just like a rose. But in the garden, for only God can unfold the rose. When God unfolds the road, he always gets it right. And when the pedals are in place, oh, it's such a beautiful sight. He knows when to hold on [Music] and the perfect time to let go. So let him have his way [Music] and watch God's love unfold the rose. When God unfolds the road, he always gets it right when the pedals are in place. Oh, it's such a beautiful sight. God knows when to hold on. and a perfect time to let go. So let him have his way [Music] and watch God unfold the rose. God knows when to hold on and the perfect time to let go. So let him have his way and watch God unfold the ro. [Applause] [Music] Amen. I was blessed by both of those songs. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give them both a round of applause. Amen. Can you pull up the words to In Christ Alone, key of Eflat? Key of Eflat. Let's stand and change the order of the service. Didn't have this song written down. It wasn't on my list, but he he wanted us to sing this song this morning. Where am I hiding? I'm hiding in Christ alone. Are you hiding in him this morning? In Christ alone, my hope is found. He is my life, my strength, my song. This quarter soul, this soul a crown firm through the fiercest drought and with heights of love. What depths of peace. Tears are shield when striving sequin. [Music] Oh, here in the blood of Christ I stand at Christ alone who took on fleshlessness of God in careless way. This gift of love and righteousness born by the ones he came to save. Still on that cross where Jesus died. The wrath of God was satisfied for every sin. My sin it was laid. Here in the death of Christ I live there in the ground. His body laid. Light of the world. My God has slained mercy. Oh glorious day. Amen. Up from the grave he rose again. And as he stands in victory glory has lost it on me for I have he and he is mine with a precious blood of Christ. No deal with life nor fear in death. This is the power of Christ. in me from life first try to final breath. Jesus Jesus commands my destiny. No power of hell. No seam of man can ever flock from his hand till he return and call me home. Here in the power of Christ I stand. [Music] Amen. God bless you all this morning. You can be seated for just a moment. And uh I just had a couple things that I wanted to say because at this very moment there is a memorial service going on for Charles Kirk. Over a 100,000 they may say 150,000 people have gathered together. People have flown from around the world to to be at that event. And uh um so um the name of his campaign, if any of you know, the name of his political platform was called Turning Point. Turning Point. Now, one thing that I totally enjoyed about him, I I can say I might have seen a clip or a little report uh something about what he did and how he went to college campuses prior to his getting shot for the and I was not a follower of Charles Kirk. I admired the fact of when I heard him debating with others, he was not ashamed &gt;&gt; to take a stand for the gospel, which I admire that. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Okay. And uh uh stuff, but I want you to understand debate has never caused the doubter to change his mind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There was never a aha moment. one of the Oh, so your stand on abortion is according to the scripture. Oh, I see it now. I'm on your side. No, no. What it was is it was a platform. Okay. Now, uh so I'm I'm not against anybody going out, but you're not going to win people by debate. &gt;&gt; You're going to win by preaching the gospel, living a life that is worthy of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. Preach a sermon. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh so uh I'm thinking is this a significant event &gt;&gt; not only here in America &gt;&gt; but globally? &gt;&gt; What does it signify? &gt;&gt; Is it possible? Is it possible that the foolish virgin right now &gt;&gt; are saying, "Oh my," &gt;&gt; because you see when the door was closing, the foolish virgin went to seek for oil. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And we know they don't get it, &gt;&gt; but they went to seek &gt;&gt; to find oil. &gt;&gt; So, there is a stirring going on right now. &gt;&gt; That's right. And we don't deny that. &gt;&gt; And um he used Charles Kirk used his political platform to try to persuade others to look at the his viewpoint, perhaps his his belief, his opinion, his uh the the way that he saw things. Um, college campuses have not become a place of education but a place of indoctrination. &gt;&gt; It's changed. &gt;&gt; And hatred and violence has become the norm. &gt;&gt; Make your viewpoint known and they will hate you. Jesus said, "You'll be hated &gt;&gt; because you're associated with me. If they hated me, they're going to hate you also." &gt;&gt; So your mere association with Jesus Christ and what you believe, people will hate you without a cause. &gt;&gt; It will be a time where they will call evil good and good evil. They will be despisers of those that are good, &gt;&gt; hateful, unthankful. We have reached a turning point here in America. But let me because if you want to take I I just thought I last night I thought you know I wonder if brother Brennham said anything about turning point &gt;&gt; be interested in 1956 in the sermon making a way he says now be praying over these do and pray hard. I just feel we haven't got much time now. 1956, we haven't got much time now. And I predict, I don't say this is the Lord saying this now. I'm predicting that this year America will receive Christ or reject Christ. I believe this will be a turning point that America will go in. We'll have a revival in this day or we won't have a revival. And I believe that this is the year that America makes its decision. I trust that they'll make it and we'll have a great revival that'll just sweep. We're having much preaching and much evangelism, but we need a revival, don't we? A real revival. &gt;&gt; That's what we need. The Lord bless you. So we can see the prophet of God was even seeing America was heading in a direction &gt;&gt; and he was trying to turn them &gt;&gt; preaching the gospel signs and wonders a vindicated ministry that outeclipsed any minister in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we see there's a turning point here in America. It's happening. and for us to ignore it. I want you to understand that it will get worse and worse. This is not a time where there's this great awakening happening in America and churches are going to get filled again and people are going to come to Christ and and uh barrooms are going to close, pornography sites are going to be shut down, movies that are uh no, it's not going to happen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says u there's a turning point here in America. And she did turn, but she turned in the wrong direction. Now she's swn to the wind. She shall reap a whirlwind. He said, 'I don't pray for her anymore. So I want you to all understand that this movement that is even in happening. Now watch. His wife says, "The legacy of my husband, I will carry it on." &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, is she going to go on the debate platform and go out and debate on campuses? I doubt it. She what she's going to do is keep the legacy of uh the platform that he opened of turning uh you know turning point. &gt;&gt; Okay. And so, uh, but I also think that we have another woman that's rising &gt;&gt; who her turning point &gt;&gt; was a long time ago &gt;&gt; by what God was showing you &gt;&gt; and it caused your life to be directly affected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there was a turning. I can tell all of you in 1971 when I came and first heard about this message I had my personal turning point. &gt;&gt; It has affected me in every facet of my life. &gt;&gt; Can any of you say it happened to me also? I've I've had a turning point. There's been a change of mind, a change of direction. &gt;&gt; Thank God that's why you're here. I trust each one of you uh would be of that same opinion. Amen. Now, we could debate it all we want. I could try to win you over to my viewpoint by debating it. &gt;&gt; Don't happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unless God opens the eyes, all you do is have a heated debate. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; If you've ever had a debate with somebody, a lot of times it just doesn't end well. But the nice thing about those that even wanted to debate with the prophet of God, he always had the right spirit. &gt;&gt; God help us to have the right attitude. Amen. Let's stand together. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what I want. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want just a change of mind. I want a change of heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be more like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of this gospel. &gt;&gt; If there's one thing that maybe we would learn out of this whole thing is be not ashamed to stand for what you believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; To be able to give an answer to those that ask you, "Why do you believe what you believe?" &gt;&gt; Amen. And you will find out right away whether or not you understand what you believe or you just said, "Well, my religion says &gt;&gt; it's not a religion. It's a relationship." &gt;&gt; And the greatest weapon of our warfare is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Let every man's word be a lie, &gt;&gt; but mine be the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Open the eyes of my heart, Brother Robert. &gt;&gt; Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open the eyes of my heart. I want to see you. I want to see you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. [Music] Open the eyes of my heart. I want to see you. [Music] &gt;&gt; I want to see you. See you high and lifted up. &gt;&gt; See you high and lifted up. &gt;&gt; Oh, shining in the light of your glory. Pour out your power and love as we sing. Holy, holy, holy. I want to see you. I want to see you. &gt;&gt; It's our prayer. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. It is our prayer that we want to see you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray that this morning as we have gathered together here in your name, we recognize that you're here. But father, may there be a revealing of your word to our hearts. &gt;&gt; Not of our knowledge and carnal understanding, but of true revelation that only comes from you. I pray may the Holy Spirit have preeminence this morning &gt;&gt; and use my vessel as a voice. May it not be my voice, but may it be your voice, the voice of the Holy Spirit speaking to your people. Father, I thank you for this day. We honor your resurrection. We thank you, Father, for every testimony and every life of those that are here, those perhaps archiving the service later. Perhaps those that are streaming around the world or even right here in Arizona right now. I pray may you bless each and everyone as we go into the word of God now. Break unto us the bread of life &gt;&gt; as only you can. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you musicians each and every one. God bless you. Let's just remain standing and turn with me in your Bibles. Please turn with me in your Bibles to Acts chapter 2 verses 37 and 39. Enjoyed the song specials. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm always blessed when you use your gift for the glory of God. You know, sometimes God will change a heart or deal with somebody through your song special. &gt;&gt; How many of you have ever been affected by somebody singing a song and said, "Wow, that was for me. You nailed it." &gt;&gt; That's why it's not with trained voices we get up here and and and we want to show off and how good we can sing and the notes and how long we can hold them. No, but just a heart that is willing to make a joyful noise unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that God put that in the Bible, a joyful noise, because that's what I make, &gt;&gt; more of a noise, but I pray that it be a joyful one that it really it comes from the heart. So, each and every one of you, it's so good to have you all out here. Eric and Kylie, it's good to have you here. I know you go back down under um tomorrow, but even though you live down under, may you rise above the down under to be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We love you guys, each and every one. Acts 2:37 and 39. Amen. Now, when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart. Now, here is the Holy Spirit coming down anointing Peter the spokesman. And watch this. And when they heard this, when they saw the disciples there and the different ones that were in the upper room, and they heard him speak the wonderful words of God &gt;&gt; in their own tongue, wherein they were born, &gt;&gt; it pricricked their hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said to them,"Repent and be baptized, every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." For the promise, what promise is he talking about? The promise of receiving the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. Amen. &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated this morning in the presence of God. I'd like to title my sermon this morning. I've got um quite a bit that's on my heart. I've got a long ways to go. I will be reading quite a bit. But I want to speak this morning on what shall we do to be saved? &gt;&gt; And I want to take a subject of saved but not sealed. And I want to look at the difference of what brother Brennham's and the scripture what the viewpoint is on being having salvation but being sealed &gt;&gt; two different things. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So we're going to look at it and some of you that have joined our church have moved here have come here in the last few years. Many of you have not been with us over the years where we sat down and we went over these things in great detail. So what I do is I'm just going to hit some of this as highlights and put those who know this already just put you in remembrance of that which you already know. Now um so I want to clarify something this morning so that all of you will understand this that there is a vast difference between church and bride. &gt;&gt; There's a vast difference between having salvation, okay, and being bride. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. And we're going to show you that there is this difference of just being born again and then going to the place of adoption which is placing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So um we want to be very clear on that. And in the sermon in why I'm against organized religion remember I believe that Martin Luther had the Holy Spirit. Absolutely. maybe not in the portion it is today because it wasn't given out. So, we've been through this you people of the tabernacle here on the blackboard, but he did believe to God and he that believeth has everlasting life. I never thought there was a person believed like me till this morning. Do any of you see the date on that? I never thought there was a person that believed like me till this morning. I heard Charles Fuller, a minister of the gospel. As I was going uh down, he believes too that the new birth is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The new birth is being born again. Is being born. The Holy Ghost is the baptism. So he says, now isn't this amazing? He says, of all the people, you would have thought that all those years everybody was on the same page, believed exactly what brother and brother Brennham said, look, all these years of ministry, what I've been trying to do is to get them to understand about the new birth. &gt;&gt; And he goes into, remember, he was born in 1909. The church age of Ladya had already begun. &gt;&gt; He was born into the time of Pentecostalism. &gt;&gt; So it was in a full swing as he was born. It already began to just uh it was a great outpouring of the Holy Spirit you know as street on and on. Now understand that the book of Revelation speaks about seven church ages. Ephesus, thy tyra and so on. But in every age, God sends a messenger. &gt;&gt; And that messenger is the messenger to the whole age. &gt;&gt; And may I say this to seed and nonseed. &gt;&gt; He is the messenger whether they receive him or not, whether they hear him or not. He's still the messenger for the age. And they will be judged. Amen. &gt;&gt; By what he has brought forth. &gt;&gt; So we know that the Bible says in Amos 3 and seven, surely the Lord God will do nothing but what he send it or reveal it to his servants, the prophets. &gt;&gt; So God is obligated to his word. Now though he addresses the whole church and the whole age, I want you to notice that there is only one specified particular group that will receive what the spirit is saying to the church. &gt;&gt; Not everyone will receive it. &gt;&gt; But there is someone who's predestinated and ordained &gt;&gt; to hear that message. &gt;&gt; And brother Brennham said she will be minority. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says in fact she will be eight times smaller &gt;&gt; than the church. &gt;&gt; We'll substantiate that here in just a moment. Now many will hear but they don't understand. Many will see but they comprehend not. They will hear the angel messenger and though he be vindicated of God and proven and vindicated by God with signs and wonders, that doesn't make them a believer. &gt;&gt; They just see he's a great man of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Signs don't make you a believer. &gt;&gt; Signs get your attention. So in the sermon, the voice of the sign, Brother Bram says in 1964, just like he's doing now, going to bring a bride out of a church, leaving the remnant of the woman's seed, the elected will be brought out of the church. The church natural will stay here through the tribulation. &gt;&gt; You understand that? You miss this rapture. Yes. &gt;&gt; What do you think the spirit of anti-semitism and anti-Christianity where it's going to head up? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Tribulation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And what are they going to do? Martyr. &gt;&gt; Who are they going to martyr? The foolish virgin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who are they also going to martyr? The 144,000. &gt;&gt; Who are they also going to martyr? &gt;&gt; Moses and Elijah. the two witnesses. So, do you understand what's happening right now? The hatred and violence. &gt;&gt; They will try to silence the voice not by debate &gt;&gt; but by violence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To take their lives. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; So, it's happening. &gt;&gt; It's happening right here. God, help us &gt;&gt; to not be ashamed. to stand for truth in this very hour. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um the elected will be brought out of the church. The church natural will stay here through the tribulation. That elected sometime is called the chosen elected remnant. Now the Bible says that many are chosen. Excuse me. Many are called but few are chosen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So one of the parables where this is kind of explained, Jesus talks about that there was a king who had a wedding for his son and many were invited and there was some that came and there was a wedding garment that you had to have on as you were a guest. You were giving a wedding garment. How many know that's what the Bible says? So in Matthew 22 11-14 and when the king came to see the guests, he saw there was a man which had not on a wedding garment, which he saith unto him, friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. And he saith und and then the king said to his servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness. Now that doesn't sound like a loving God. That doesn't sound so kind to me. Well, I'm sorry, buddy. You didn't have your garment on. Well, listen. I tell you what. We got an extra one in the coat closet here. Go get him a garment. No, let me tell you that this kind, benevolent, loving, forgiving God will one day turn to a God of wrath. &gt;&gt; To spurn what God has given to you now for you to make yourself ready. If you spurn it, you will face the wrath of God. And so what he did, he cast him out into outer darkness. Brother Brim said, "What was that? Tribulation." &gt;&gt; I cannot think of a more horrible time that a man was there. He was shaking hands. He was there um hugging necks. Hey brother, we're here. We made it. He's the only one that doesn't have his garment. &gt;&gt; How did you get in? &gt;&gt; You ever had a dream that you were the only one that didn't have the right garment on or something and and you stood out and you you But see now he was cast out into outer darkness. Now watch. Bind him hand and foot. Cassim out where there was weeping and nashing of teeth but many are called but few are chosen. &gt;&gt; Second Peter 1 and10 the Bible says wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and your election sure &gt;&gt; if you do these things you shall never fall. Now that word fall does not mean you won't make mistakes. &gt;&gt; You'll never fall away from the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Now so what is the wedding garment? What is the wedding garment? It is a symbol. &gt;&gt; Remember the Bible is a book of symbols and once you know the symbols it interprets itself. &gt;&gt; So brother Brennham says in Revelation chapter 4 1960 then if the wedding garment is the baptism of the Holy Spirit how are we going to be represented any other way? The first church age had to come by the door Christ Jesus. He baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost to put on the wedding garment. You see what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is? Wedding garment &gt;&gt; in God's provided way. 53. Brethren, there's no big me and little you. Then when you come by the way of the door, when he found a man back there that didn't have a wedding garment on, he come in some other way besides the door because Jesus said, "I am the door." &gt;&gt; I am the gate to the sheepfold. &gt;&gt; Every man that comes by the door is going to get the same road. &gt;&gt; And that robe is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, just as there was an Exodus in the days of Moses with the children of Israel, we too are also in another Exodus. &gt;&gt; And we look at that Exodus, it gives us a type and shadow of what to expect in this. Because as it was, so shall it be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why Brother Bram said, "I'm a typologist. I go back into the Bible. I see what happened then. I see how they handled it then. I see what went on then and I can see what's going to happen in the future. And brother Brennham says in the sermon the token and now it's a type of today shown as we are also facing another exodus. God bringing Israel out of G uh Egypt to the promised land. He was a type of Christ bringing the bride out of the church to the promised land. We are in another exodus. &gt;&gt; As God brought a nation out of a nation, God will bring a bride out of a church. &gt;&gt; The bride will be called from all the churches. &gt;&gt; It'll be the elect of God and we'll be brought out. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is coming to take a bride out of a church. &gt;&gt; So, I don't want to just say, "Praise God, I'm in the church." I don't want to just say I'm called. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just say I'm caught up into this movement. &gt;&gt; But I want the movement in me. &gt;&gt; I want it to be such a stirring &gt;&gt; that it causes a change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The church has heard the messenger. They have eaten the heavenly mana. They drank of the rock and that rock was Christ. We found the Bible showing us examples of this. 1 Corinthians 10:es 1-8. Moreover, brethren, I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were baptized under the cloud and all bapt uh passed through the sea. And all were baptized unto Moses. Now, I want you to understand Moses baptized no one. &gt;&gt; His movement was an anointing that they came under. It baptized them with an anointed word. &gt;&gt; All baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea. And did all eat the same spiritual meat. All did drink of the same spiritual drink. And they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them. And that rock was Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were a part of something. But with many of them God was not well pleased. &gt;&gt; Here's the warning. &gt;&gt; For they were overthrown in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Now these things were for our examples. Is that right? &gt;&gt; To the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted, neither be idoltors as were some of them. And the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play. This is not a time to play saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day. Three and 20,000 in one day &gt;&gt; committing fornication against Christ, the revealed word of that hour. In the sermon, the voice of the sign, watch, God typed, God was bringing Israel, his people, out of a nation, a nation out of a nation. A nation out of a nation. Beautiful type of today that God is calling his bride out of a church. Christian bride out of a Christian church. A bride church out of a church which is called in the Bible. So I want you to understand that those that came out of Egypt, brother Brennham said every great ministry within the scripture has three pulls. &gt;&gt; And he says and even Moses had three pulls. Elijah had three pulls. &gt;&gt; So under the first and second pull, they were all in a movement. But it wasn't until the ministry changed and God spoke to Joshua and told him, "As I was with Moses, I'm going to be with you." &gt;&gt; It was the same spirit, different ministry. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; The ministry was changing, but using a different vessel. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This ministry of the end time &gt;&gt; is changing also. It's the same spirit but in a different vessel. &gt;&gt; God in morpha changing his mask. &gt;&gt; The same spirit was in Christ is now in the church. &gt;&gt; But then out of the church, God is calling a bride. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to just revel in the fact, praise God, I've been called out. &gt;&gt; You see, because redemption has two parts. Coming out of and going into. Too many people have come out and they revel in the fact I've come out. Don't just say I came out. Let's say let's go in. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They all saw the first and second pull, but they failed to catch what God was doing under the Joshua ministry where he placed them where they should be. And there was some of those that came out under that ministry. If you know that uh when they were getting ready to cross over, some said, "We'll just stay here. We're kind of satisfied." &gt;&gt; And they didn't even cross over Jordan. &gt;&gt; So, we can see types within the message who have gone no further than coming out. &gt;&gt; They didn't cross over. God help us. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in Hebrews chapter 3, we pick this up. Harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness. When your fathers tempted me, prove me and saw my works 40 years. Wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said, they do always heir in their heart and they have not known my ways. So I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest. What is rest? The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That is the divine promise. And I've promised to give you a rest. Not as the world gives. I'll give you a peace. I'll give you a rest. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "The Sabbath of this day is the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; So I swear in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest. Take heed, brethren, lest there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. But exhort one another daily, which is called today, lest any of you should be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. &gt;&gt; What is sin? Unbelief. &gt;&gt; So we see verse 19. So we see they could not enter in because of unbelief. &gt;&gt; If any of you do not make it, it's because you allowed unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not faith. Unbelief. Well, I doubt that. I doubt this and I doubt that. Don't be a doubter. Be a believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't ask, "Do you understand it all?" &gt;&gt; He said, "Do you believe?" &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4:1, "Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should come short of it. For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them." But the word preached did not profit them. not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. Do you see? It's not just hearing. &gt;&gt; It's not just playing a tape. &gt;&gt; It's not just hearing the five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; It's not just hearing the voice &gt;&gt; speaking. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? But it's having faith mixed with what you've heard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't just come to church and say, "Wow, that that was good." and minister spoke with with with uh zeal and he he raised his voice and he he seemed to be persuasive. &gt;&gt; Do you see? I don't want you to just be moved by some kind of emotion. &gt;&gt; I want you to be moved by the Holy Spirit that causes your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That you cease from what you did. That you turn from your way. And you don't let unbelief rule you, but you let faith rule you. &gt;&gt; Faith is revelation. &gt;&gt; It's not knowledge. &gt;&gt; Now, let me continue on with this thought. Saved but not sealed. Remember this church that when you are born again, you are babes in Christ. The natural is a type of the spiritual. So, praise the Lord. God bless you. Except a man be born again, he cannot understand the things of God. Right? And so, the new birth just starts your journey. &gt;&gt; You become a babe in Christ, sincere milk of the word. You hear the love of God. Oh, wonderful. Every sermon you hear when you first come to God is all about God's love. Oh, oh, God loves him. Take that little bottle and you suck on it and man, everything is God's love. But then you start growing up, &gt;&gt; okay? And you start learning to walk. And when you learn to walk, you fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you make mistakes and you get weapons. &gt;&gt; Huh? Yeah. You learn obedience by the things you suffer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. You can tell your child not to do it. And if there is no consequence when they overdo or go over your word and there's no consequence, they're going to smile at you and just laugh when you tell them you're going to get it because you never get them. &gt;&gt; Spoil the rod and you spoil the child. Spare the rod. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Once in a while, you need a good-looking. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; That's right. As many as I love, &gt;&gt; I rebuke and I chasen. Be zealous, therefore, &gt;&gt; and repent. That means quit doing what you did. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember my mother, very quick little testimony. little boy. My parents, we went out. We lived right next to an old um chicken um place where they processed chickens. And in there uh they had all the hundreds of thousands of the feet of chicken and parts of chicken and and it was just an old dirty dilapidated down building and was filthy and stunk, but it was just a great place for boys to play. Wow, look at this. The feet we you know. Anyway, and and so my my my mother had said, "You stay away from that. That is contaminated. It's filthy. If you go over there, you're going to get in trouble." So we didn't listen. We went over there anyway and we came back and mom had seen us crossing the field going in that direction. Where have you boys been? Um, she says, "Well, listen before you say, I'll tell you if you if you tell me the truth, you'll never get a weapon." Wow. Where'd you go? We went to the chicken coop. Guess. So, she said, "Okay, thank you for telling me the truth. Now, you boys, I've told you, and I'm not going to tell you again. Don't you do that again." Next day, we went over there. She said, "Where have you boys been?" We said, "Chicken coop." We were taken in the back room and beaten. But I was so confused because you said, "If I tell you the truth on the Yeah. Well, that was yesterday. You didn't learn, did you? You didn't hear the the rest of the story." &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's have a Paul Harvey on this thing. &gt;&gt; There's the rest of the story. You You go out and you do wrong. Now, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; after you've been warned, you're going to get a weapon. So, I want you to understand, uh, you are not born mature Christians. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's never been a sister that goes to the hospital, comes home, that's got a baby is the size of Brother David. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; I know some of you have had big babies, but they were never that big. They were born children, &gt;&gt; infants, babies, and they grow mature. Now I want you to see in Galatians 4:es 1 and two. Now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differ from a servant, though he be Lord of all. So a servant and an heir. There's no difference in the two of them, but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. So there comes a time when it's appointed of the father. You are under tutors and governor. Every one of you have a report card that is being taken back to your heavenly father asking how's my son doing? &gt;&gt; That's right. How's my daughter doing? Uh, well, uh, I wonder what your report card says. &gt;&gt; If somebody's taking a report back, are they obedient? &gt;&gt; They're having a struggle. &gt;&gt; Are they being foolish because they're not doing what I say? So anyway, I want you to understand that in Galatians 4:es 4-7, but when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his son made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because ye are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts, crying, aba, father. Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son, and if a son, than an heir of God through Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brennham begins to deal with issues, even uh doctrinal issues that were incorrect. And yet, he's heard of all these things. I want to show you this, show you this quote on the sermon, you must be born again. He says, "People are told out on the West Coast." Now, now he's repeating what they have been teaching. Oh, we got an immortal baptism. We baptize you in water and turn you right back into a young man right there, a young woman. Now, I know, let me just take you a little bit further. I know some that say when you are baptized into Christ and though you've been married two or three times that now you're now a virgin. You're turned back into a virgin and you can just marry uh anybody that well the new birth that changes it all. No, let's go to the doctrinal teaching. &gt;&gt; You understand? So he says, "Oh, we got the Elijah's garments. They've got manifested sons of God." Yes, sir, brother. God's getting manifested sons right now. Manifesting. Tell them all about this. Tonight you're a sinner. Tomorrow you're a manifested son of God. Nonsense. &gt;&gt; Where do you get that in the word? Babies are not born men. They're born babies and grow to men. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see his doctrinal teaching? &gt;&gt; You learn &gt;&gt; how to serve God even by your mistakes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of you will make mistakes. &gt;&gt; And I have found out just about the time I think I'm doing real well, I make even a worse mistake. And then I realize, oh God, I need your grace. Now Paul picks this up in Corinthians in 1 Corinthians 13:11. When I was a child, I spake as a child, understood as a child, I thought as a child. Nothing wrong with being a child. &gt;&gt; It's just never growing up is the problem. &gt;&gt; But when I became a man, that's a differentiation. When I became a man, &gt;&gt; I put away childish things. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 5 11 and onward. Of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing. For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you need have need of one teach you again, which be the first principles of the oracles of God, and you become of some of as such as have need of milk and not of strong meat. For everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. Hebrews 6:1. Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ. This is amazing. &gt;&gt; Wait a second. What are you talking about, brother? &gt;&gt; Leaving the doctrines of Christ. God forbid. &gt;&gt; Watch what he's saying. Let us go on unto perfection. Let's go on unto maturity. &gt;&gt; Not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith towards God. Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of the laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. Let's go beyond these things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me show you what the prophet said about being born again. Here is the prophet's definition of the new birth. I'm interested. &gt;&gt; In the sermon, the countdown 1962. &gt;&gt; So if a man sets on the thought of justifications all you have to have, he's wrong. He's got to be wrong. Then if the church who believes like the many of Pentecostals that the Holy Ghost is it, that's all. Just repent and get the Holy Ghost, that's still wrong because you've got to get sanctification in there to cleanse it before the Holy Ghost comes in. If you don't, you leave out the blood. See, the new birth as people talks about the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth. Now, that's wrong. Now, there are many ministers within the message that haven't got this doctrally correct. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let him define what is the new birth. &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from the new birth. &gt;&gt; The new birth is when you're born again. But the Holy Ghost is when power comes in to that birth for service. That's exact the new birth. You have the new birth by being believing on the Lord Jesus Christ. See, by having faith and accepting him as your savior, that's birth because you pass from death unto life. And he quotes St. John 5:24. He that hearth my words. That same group had to go to Pentecost to be baptized with the Holy Ghost. I want to ask you, the disciples for three years, three and a half years, were they born again? Absolutely. But he says, "I want you to go to Jerusalem and tarry until you're endued with power." &gt;&gt; They'd been casting out devils, preaching the gospel, signs and wonders following, and did it without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Okay. So when you talk like you got the to be born again and applying that to the Holy Ghost, many of the Methodists and so forth are wrong there. It cannot it won't cope with the scripture here. You get things sideways. They got to take it the way the scriptures got it placed out there. And it goes on and they already believe to eternal life and so forth, but they had to have the Holy Ghost for power. You shall be witnesses unto me after the Holy Ghost has come upon you because the Holy Ghost is a witness of the resurrection showing that you have become an adult in Christ. You're an adult. Now, here's the question that they asked Brother Brennham concerning the condition of those who do not get the Holy Ghost. They're just born again. Are they going to go in the rapture? What's the difference between salvation and being sealed? They're saved but not sealed. Questions and answers here on the image of the beast 1954. If a person dies without the baptism of the Holy Ghost, will they be lost? No sir. If he's a believer, he'll come up in the resurrection. Second resurrection. If he's got the baptism, he'll go in the first resurrection. &gt;&gt; This is it. Now, I don't want you to just be moved on by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Okay? I don't want you to just have spiritual experiences with God like Jacob and it never changed him. They were Bethl experiences. Nothing wrong with Bethl experiences. You can see angels. You can see a ladder ascending and descending up into heaven and angels descending upon it. You can have all kinds of spiritual things happening. But Jacob was never changed. &gt;&gt; So Bethl experiences are good, but don't let that be your basis &gt;&gt; of saying that you're saved. &gt;&gt; Go on further. &gt;&gt; Let's keep going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're born children. You grow into adults &gt;&gt; and then you're tested on what you believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, the church is moved on by the Holy Ghost. Again, like I said, be experiences are fine. That's great. I don't uh I say we we've all had those. Billy Paul said, "I saw the angel in person. It never kept me from going into sin." Justification, listen to this, is an act of the Holy Spirit. Taking the cup, picking it up. Okay? And then sanctification. See, justification is picking it up. Sanctification is cleansing. Set aside for service. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost baptism is putting it into service. &gt;&gt; Are we together on that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, justification is an act of the Holy Ghost. Sanctification is an act of the Holy Ghost. But the baptism of the Holy Ghost is also a work of the Holy Spirit quickening that seed within you and giving you the breath of life. And now you are born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Without the breath of life, without the quickening of the Holy Spirit, Brother Bren said, you're still born. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. You got to have that posterior protoplasm. Whack. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's the new birth. &gt;&gt; Water blood spirit. Justification, sanctification, holy spirit coming down, germatizing that seed goes into the heart, &gt;&gt; comes from the hearing gate. &gt;&gt; He that heareth my words goes through the the ear gate into the mind, womb, and the spirit. And as long as you don't abort and say, "I don't believe it." It goes into the heart, pregnant seed, and guess what? Now you're born again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. But you're a baby. &gt;&gt; So now you got to learn. &gt;&gt; So in the third seal, Brother Bram picks this up. 1963. If the Pentecostal message was the last message, which justification, sanctification, and baptism of the Holy Ghost, the last three messages, the last three church ages forms the complete birth. Wow. Wesley, Luther, and Pentecost. What does it do? It completes the new birth. &gt;&gt; But there's something even after that. What is it? &gt;&gt; The word made way for the word himself. The Holy Ghost makes way for the Holy Ghost. And then you have a complete word birth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because every seed has got to bring forth of its own kind. If it's denominational teaching, it brings forth denominational people. &gt;&gt; But if it's original seed, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; if it's original seed, it will bring forth of the original kind. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to baby them. &gt;&gt; They're not hot house plants. &gt;&gt; You tell them the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not tucked into it. You're not coaxed into it. You're not babyed into it. &gt;&gt; Listen, I say unto every one of you, become men. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Become women. &gt;&gt; Mature adults. &gt;&gt; The church. Listen, the church, every one of them in the church is born again. They're all firstborn sons and daughters. They all have eternal life. As long as they do not reject the word because there are some that say they're born again and then they come up to the fact that they reject the word, they couldn't have had the word &gt;&gt; because you can't reject it. If you're begotten of the word, you say amen to the word that begot you. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; So, they may not live it. Church, foolish virgin may not live it, but they don't reject it. &gt;&gt; How many of you know of believers within the message that are not living the message, and they just say, "Well, I believe it. I don't come against Brother Brendom. don't come against the message of the hour. I believe it. I just can't live it. So foolish virgin, okay, comes to the place where they they have eternal life. I'm going to show you from the scripture and from the message. &gt;&gt; Now, all of them will be redeemed. They're going to be saved. &gt;&gt; They're going to be in heaven. &gt;&gt; But they're not part of the bride. They're not in the new Jerusalem. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Listen, if we're going to run, we want to run to gain the prize. &gt;&gt; If you're going to want to get raptured out of this age, you have to press into rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; Or you just going to sit there and say, "Well, I can't I don't believe it all. I just don't reject it." And you know, no. Come into it. &gt;&gt; All right. Foolish virgin, understand this, will be saved. They have eternal life. They do not get eternal life at the white throne. &gt;&gt; They were sheep &gt;&gt; and there were goats &gt;&gt; and there's a separation. Why do they come at white throne judgment? Because they were foolish. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The bride receives her judgment now &gt;&gt; because judgment begins at the house of God. &gt;&gt; So we come here to judge ourselves. This is the only judgment. Hallelujah. The bride received. It's now. And it's self judgment. Judge yourselves. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; You see that? But foolish hears it but doesn't heed it. &gt;&gt; Now in then Jesus came 1957. When you come here and bow your heads and you surrender to God and repent of your sins, you're born again. You're a candidate then to be baptized into the church by the Holy Ghost. You're born again. Then you're a candidate. You see that? Into the body of Christ. You become a believer. You're born again when you believe. He talks about he that believeth my words. Then God gives you the next which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He goes on again in Hebrews series. When you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, then you have the new birth. When you believe on the Lord, you receive a new thought, a new life. But it isn't the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You've got the new birth. When you believe, you've got eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you believe, you've got eternal life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a gift of God. &gt;&gt; That's the new birth. You're converted means you're turned around. But the baptism of the Holy Ghost puts you into the body of Christ, subject to the gifts for service. Subject to the gifts. Foolish virgin don't come subject to nothing. Right. &gt;&gt; Do you see? &gt;&gt; It doesn't make you any more of a Christian. &gt;&gt; Wow. You mean the baptism of the Holy Ghost doesn't make you any more of a Christian? No. You got eternal life. What does it do? It put you subject to the gifts. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, I go to church because I'm supposed to." Submit yourselves under the authority of those that God has placed over you whose faith following that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. That's why you do what you do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You come subject. Otherwise, Willy's virgin. I ain't coming subject to nobody. I don't have to go to church. I don't have to have a pastor. I don't have to pay my tithe. I can do what I want. &gt;&gt; Doesn't make you any more of a Christian. He continues on Hebrews paragraph 270. But as far as having eternal life and being a Christian, you're a Christian the moment you believe. Now that that uh that's not make believe, it's truly believe on the Lord Jesus and accept him as your personal savior. You're born again right there. Have eternal life. God comes into you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. A new creature in Christ. But I want to ask you, how are you doing on your walk with God in growing up to be a mature Christian? &gt;&gt; He goes on, have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe? Now, when you believe, you got eternal life. That's the new birth. That's your conversion changing. But the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the power of God. and you're baptized into and are subject to those nine spiritual gifts. What are those gifts? He mentions a few. Preaching, evangelist, apostles, pastors, prophets, so on and so forth. Don't make you any more of a Christian. It just sets you positionally in a place to be a man of uh be a ministering spirit in the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he goes on and listen, I don't want to bog you down with just quotes, but the reason I show you these quotes is what does brother Brennham teach about the new birth? What does he teach about adoption? What does he talk teach about the four living creatures? What does he talk about the four antichrist spirits? The red horse, the white horse, so on and so forth. And he says, "And there's four spirits that combat that. The lion, the ox, the man, and the eagle. These are anointings." You understand that? Okay. So, he says the last three ages, Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, brought forth a new birth. But he said that makes way for the word itself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you realize that this messenger brought to us back the full truth of the word? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That completed a a word birth. &gt;&gt; And brother Bram says in adoption. How many knows the rules of adoption in the Old Testament? Now in the Old Testament when a child was born into a family, he was a child when he was born because he was born of his parents. He's a son of the family and heir to all things. Then after being born, we are predestinated unto adoption to be placed into the body of Christ. He goes on on paragraph 151, after you're adopted, all right, after you're adopted, you're placed. Then you understand after the ceremony said that you've been put into the body correctly. You're a son. Sure. A daughter. When you're born again, that's your birth. But now you're positionally placed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then you be understand that this adoption. We have been called unto adoption. Not just a birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just saying, "Well, I I go to church. That's it. that that that's all. I've been born again. That's it. And we've made it in the message teachings that the new birth is all you got. How many of you believe that God sent a prophet? Amen. God bless you. How many of you believe you've been born again? Praise God. You've been baptized. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. You made it. That's it. Then I want to ask you, have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Why are people so tossed about? Why are there so many ups and downs? Because they haven't been taught correctly. &gt;&gt; Listen. If the prize for this age is to go into rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're going to run, &gt;&gt; hey, listen. I don't want second place because second place &gt;&gt; gives you tribulation. &gt;&gt; I want a way out of here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to strive to enter in. &gt;&gt; I'm going to try to gain that prize. What is it? The token. Without the token, you ain't going. &gt;&gt; So, if some minister can water it down, hybrid it down, &gt;&gt; soft soap it so much and just say, "Well, you're a member of the church, you're born again, that's it. You got it." He's watering the word. &gt;&gt; You need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The token. &gt;&gt; Do not cheapen, &gt;&gt; the token of this hour &gt;&gt; by just saying, "Well, you believe you got it. That's a deceiver. &gt;&gt; The church will be saved. I'm showing you. &gt;&gt; She's not sealed. &gt;&gt; They have eternal life. Saved but not sealed. Had he writes, "Boys, what are you asking?" Had he right? The salvation &gt;&gt; of my two boys. Thus sayaith the Lord. I give you your two boys. They came in crying, weeping. Where are they today? &gt;&gt; Are they bride? Do they go to church? Listen, when you begin to to look at all this stuff, and I'm not judging that. All I'm saying is, hey, listen. I believe they're saved. Why? The prophet said, thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; She asked for the salvation. They came right there, gave their heart to God and and guess what? They got eternal life. &gt;&gt; Are they bride? Nope. Can't be. Otherwise, they'll be doing what the bride would be doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Being full obedience &gt;&gt; to the word of God and ties you to the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saved but not sealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus also gives an explanation in Matthew 7. He said, "Not many of those that say unto me, Lord, Lord, &gt;&gt; shall enter into the kingdom of heaven." And he but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven. Many will say unto me that day, Lord, have not we prophesied in thy name, and in thy name cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works. All of this in the name of Jesus. How many know there's power in the name? &gt;&gt; I see I see ministers. &gt;&gt; I see them saying in the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus, that powerful name, in the name of Jesus, I jer thee, Satan, by the name of Jesus. How many realize that the seven sons ofKea &gt;&gt; were doing exactly the same thing? Thought they had a deliverance ministry &gt;&gt; and they come and guess what? Paul, I know, and Jesus we know, but who are you? &gt;&gt; They were trying to cast out in the name of Jesus. God deliver us from some of these that call themselves deliverance ministries. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said, "You go to lay hands on somebody that's been living a life contrary to the word." &gt;&gt; And he said, "You want to cast that devil off them?" And he says, "And they have not repented." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the conviction come on their heart and they repented." He says, "You know what you can do? You can anoint them with oil all you want? You can scream over them the name of Jesus and that devil's got a right to stay right there." That's why so much of the time we see our youth our youth are being confused right now because they go to campaign after campaign, meeting after meeting, and and we think that the the the the problem solver is to have a prayer line. &gt;&gt; No, I tell you, you know what you need to do? Preach a word that'll bring a conviction. Repent or perish. Stop what you're doing. Don't just come up here. Don't think I injure thee in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; And go out and a week later they're worse than they was when they before. &gt;&gt; No wonder they're confused. No wonder they're saying there's nothing to this message. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because they've been told by somebody that's it. Just come up here. And maybe the spirit left for a week or two. &gt;&gt; Maybe they felt pretty good. &gt;&gt; Then depression and &gt;&gt; all of this stuff. And oh, they go back into Jesus said, "Go and sin no more, lest the &gt;&gt; lest the worst thing come upon you." Questions answers 1961. Brother Brennham, what happens to the people who are the con considered the sleeping virgin when they are judged at the judgment? Sleeping virgin. What happens to them? The sleeping virgin will be saved, of course. They're saved. Do they have salvation? &gt;&gt; Saved but not sealed. Watch this. Now, she'll never be the bride. But she is a saved group of people that come in the judgment that will not be included in the bride. As long as they are virgins, they are before God. They are to be saved. They'll be the sheep on the right side and the unsaved will be the goats on the left side of the great white throne judgment. &gt;&gt; But guess what? They're going to be judged. &gt;&gt; Tribulation judges them. &gt;&gt; You either judge yourself now or you be foolish and you'll be judged. &gt;&gt; And guess what? the spirit of hatred and violence. &gt;&gt; He said that little hunted, persecuted &gt;&gt; little remnant that's left over after the bride is gone. &gt;&gt; You better get some gumption and stand up for what's right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because otherwise, you're going to have to give your life because you know what? Without the shedding of blood, &gt;&gt; understand this. Let me give you a doctrinal teaching. &gt;&gt; When the day of grace for the Gentiles is over, And he said there'll not be another Gentile saved. &gt;&gt; Are we together on that? &gt;&gt; He says right now, he said Christ, the body of Jesus Christ sits on the altar of sacrifice before the throne. And he says, "But at that time," he says, "the spirit of God will enter back into and put on, take off the body from off of the altar of sacrifice and we'll put on the body to come back down." Do you understand it? So now there's no more sacrifice. &gt;&gt; So if God requires blood, &gt;&gt; where does the foolish virgin If you don't come under his blood, you'll have to come under your own blood &gt;&gt; and seal your own testimony &gt;&gt; with your own blood. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you this hatred and violence that we see coming up right now. when that spirit of antichrist which is a religious system that if you don't agree with it or whatever at the end time when the if you don't accept the mark of the beast &gt;&gt; and you don't agree with this system they'll hate you they'll kill you &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; this hatred and violence that you see right now &gt;&gt; in its embryionic form &gt;&gt; it's just starting But when that pale horse rider when he begins to ride death &gt;&gt; and hell follow him &gt;&gt; you think it's bad now. Brother Brenham said they'll be ministers. He said go to pray for somebody. They'll be shot in the street. &gt;&gt; These people that are your neighbors &gt;&gt; that are kind and sweet. Little Joe and Linda. You understand? See, listen. The day of debate and all of this stuff, you you can debate. You can go down to the street corners and God bless those that want to go and debate with those and say, "Prove me wrong." God bless Charlie Kirk for what he stood for. Amen. &gt;&gt; But there was nobody being changed. &gt;&gt; What he did was he showed, I'm not ashamed of what I believe, and I'll stand here and I'll use the word of God. And one thing that was good about him was he wasn't losing his cool. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I could do it, &gt;&gt; honestly. Oh, yeah. Well, come here. I believe on the laying on of hands because you know what? Listen, if any of you have ever been in a debate debate with somebody and they get in your face and they get mad and they get angry, &gt;&gt; huh? &gt;&gt; It's not nice. &gt;&gt; I've never seen in a debate that somebody on the other side is convinced. &gt;&gt; What it is is two opposing forces. I want you to understand that the forces of evil and of darkness are against the forces of light. And it's coming to a conflict. &gt;&gt; It's happening. The contest is on. &gt;&gt; You're in the midst of it. Now, do you see the worst of all ages? &gt;&gt; God bless those who want to go out and debate with him. I don't. I'm sorry. I want to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Questions answers 1963. This is questions answers on the seals. What happened to born again believers who are in the various denominations but not in the bride of Christ? What happens to them? Now, brother Brandham said there are born again believers in all denominations. &gt;&gt; I believe Charlie Kirk was one of them. &gt;&gt; Do I doubt that he's going to be there? No, I don't. I believe he'll be there. It's born again. &gt;&gt; Stood for Christ. &gt;&gt; They go into the tribulation. &gt;&gt; What happens to those who don't go into bride? They go into tribulation. &gt;&gt; They are martyed in the tribulation. They come up in the last after the millennium for their judgment. &gt;&gt; See, because the Bible said that the rest of the living, the rest of the dead live not again for a thousand years. &gt;&gt; He came to the earth when 10,000 times 10,000 of his saints. Is that right? His bride judgment was set and the books were open and another was book was open which is the book of life. He separated them from the goats, from the sheep. Is that right? They had nothing to do with the bride. She's standing right there in judgment with her queen and the king and queen together. &gt;&gt; They are saved but not sealed. &gt;&gt; You know Abraham, there are examples of this throughout scripture. Abraham and Lot. Brother Bram said Abraham elected Lot. nominational believer, &gt;&gt; a nominal believer. &gt;&gt; Do you know Lot was akin to Abraham? &gt;&gt; Blood relation. &gt;&gt; Lot chooses to live in Sodom. His righteous soul is vexed daily by the things that surrounds him. and Lot's daughters even to the point of get him drunk because they believe well there is no man to give a seed. So they get their father Lot drunk and they have an incestuous relationship with Lot. And the Bible says in Genesis 19, watch this. And they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him and perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose. They were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. And the firstborn bear a son, and called his name Moab, and the same as the father of the Moabites unto this day. And the younger also bare a son, and called his name Benami, the same as the father of the children of Amnan unto this day. Now, stop here for just a moment because our our brother Warren Argizola preached Wednesday night and it was it was tremendous. And he says, "Now the Moabites and the Ammonites shall not enter the kingdom of God for 10 generations, 400 years, they cannot enter in." And he turns right around and said, "Ruth, who is a &gt;&gt; Moabitis, &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, what happened?" &gt;&gt; Did God change his mind? &gt;&gt; Did he break his word? &gt;&gt; And there'll not be a Moabitete enter into the congregation of the children of God for 400 years. So what changed Ruth from a curse &gt;&gt; to a blessing? &gt;&gt; She said, "Your God, [Applause] &gt;&gt; your God will be my God, and your people will be my people." There was a union taking place. &gt;&gt; She joined herself to the Old Testament covenant of Abraham's seed. And I shall [Applause] I will give unto the seed of Abraham an unconditional covenant. &gt;&gt; She joined herself to Naomi. &gt;&gt; Where you go, I go. &gt;&gt; What message you believe, I believe. &gt;&gt; You see, and so she she's got this unit. So now Naomi has got a &gt;&gt; kinsman. &gt;&gt; Because of her husband. &gt;&gt; She comes back. &gt;&gt; She tells Orpa and Ruth, "You guys go off." Orpa goes back to the world. &gt;&gt; Ruth decides. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She's now joined to Naomi. &gt;&gt; Naomi says, "I'm going back. I'm cursed. I'm cursed. Look at my life. It's nothing left. I'm going back. And she goes back to the land of promise. &gt;&gt; And when she's there, she finds out there's a kinsman. &gt;&gt; I have a nearer kinsman. &gt;&gt; And he shall do the work. And now Ruth, I want you to understand who was a Moabitete. &gt;&gt; Who was under the curse? &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, the covenant is greater than the curse. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Grace is greater than the law. &gt;&gt; She came under that grace covenant. &gt;&gt; She came under the promise of the covenant. I will watch over your seed and a seed after you to as many as the Lord God calls. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And now by her union to Naomi, &gt;&gt; she has a right &gt;&gt; to even glean in the fields of Boaz. &gt;&gt; And while she's gleaning, Boaz falls in love with her. &gt;&gt; A Moabit is &gt;&gt; God saw virtue before cleansing. while we were yet sinners. &gt;&gt; Christ died. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? &gt;&gt; When she joined herself to Naomi, she comes under a covenant &gt;&gt; because of a union. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that what God has done in this age, he's brought to you. Amen. You are seed of Abraham &gt;&gt; and there's been an Melzdc &gt;&gt; that has come down and met &gt;&gt; with Abraham &gt;&gt; in the cool of the evening. Do you understand? Oh my brother, my sister. And so what's happened? You've come under the same covenant. &gt;&gt; Who is this Melazedc? &gt;&gt; What is this attraction? What is this that you call the message of the hour? I'll tell you what it is. &gt;&gt; It's a union. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a uniting. &gt;&gt; It's a coming together. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Alpha and Omega coming back together. Husband and wife. &gt;&gt; Then the two shall become one. &gt;&gt; And they're no longer of two different but one flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you're in Christ, you are neither male nor female, Jew nor Gentile, bond nor free. &gt;&gt; But you've been come under the covenant of he that made the covenant. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 7, let me try to bring this to a close here. And Lot went down and had backslid. Though he was a Hebrew, he went down and backslid. Let me say this. There are some that have backslid &gt;&gt; that are real Hebrews. &gt;&gt; And don't count them out &gt;&gt; because it ain't over till it's over. There might be the last minute and all of a sudden they repent. Oh God, I repent. &gt;&gt; Listen, I've got a son that is wewarded and I told him, I said, "I do not. I'm not here to preach to you. You know the sermons. &gt;&gt; You've been raised right. &gt;&gt; But I said, I am the father of a prodigal &gt;&gt; who's going out and eats with the pigs. But I said, &gt;&gt; I stand at the door. &gt;&gt; I wait for the turning. &gt;&gt; I'm not looking at the present. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you count somebody out. &gt;&gt; It ain't over till it's over. I said, "And and and son, when you turn," I said, "I'm going to throw a party." &gt;&gt; I said, "I will rejoice. I will give you the ring. I'll give you the signal, and I'll give you the robe. I will just rejoice." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How dare we look down our nose? &gt;&gt; It ain't over till it's over. Yes. &gt;&gt; Do I condone the way they live? No, I don't. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; I can love the sinner and hate the sin. &gt;&gt; It just takes a moment. &gt;&gt; It just takes a moment. &gt;&gt; And when God convicts their heart and they turn &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Are we going to look down at somebody if the And let me tell you what's happening right now. The prodigals are coming in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People are turning. &gt;&gt; Some who have been away from the message &gt;&gt; are coming back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So we any of you got a friend, a loved one, a brother, a sister, husband, wife, daughter, son that's not living right? Maybe, you know, maybe they got offended. Maybe somebody did something and ah I tell you what, if that's a bride, I don't want a part of it and somebody offended them. &gt;&gt; The Bible says offenses must come. &gt;&gt; But woe unto them &gt;&gt; that bring the offense. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amazing thing is most of the people that have been offended have also been one that offended somebody else, &gt;&gt; but they only see what was done to them. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Don't let me offend anyone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brennham, let me continue on here. Lot was saved. Don't ever think that Lot wasn't saved. He was because all the time when he was in the wrong place, Lot went in the wrong down in Sodom. Poor old guy, righteous seed in the wrong place and and his soul was vexed daily &gt;&gt; because he was down in Sodom. The Bible said the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous soul daily. See, Abraham a type of the elect seed. He did not go down to Sodom. No, but he stood in the gap for Lot. &gt;&gt; I think we ought to stand in the gap for others and say, "God, bring them in." &gt;&gt; We cut people off. &gt;&gt; Don't cut them off. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, questions and answers. musicians have become I'm I'm bringing this to a club. The nominal believers like Lot, he's going through the tribulation period. Oh my, &gt;&gt; poor Lot. Poor Lot. He's going through the tribulation and be saved as it was by fire. Noah went through the tribulation period carried above it come out with Ham who polluted the earth again. Lot come out his own daughters slept with him and he had children by his own daughters. But Abraham brought forth the royalty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The seed of promise. Enoch went to glory in the rapture. Just took a walk and went home. He never went through the tribulation period. &gt;&gt; See the church will go through the tribulation period. You see the difference between church and bride. Amen. Hebrews 11:5, "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and he was not found because God had translated him." And before his translation, he had this testimony that he pleased God because without faith, it's impossible to please God. So I believe what's happening right now, God is dealing with the type of Enoch right now. You're having the fa translating you, bringing you from one glory to another glory. The power of transformation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Transforming you, &gt;&gt; changing you. Oh, you listen. We're not going to have the fullness of our redemption until the rapture. &gt;&gt; And then in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, we shall all be changed. &gt;&gt; I thank God for that. Until that time, I deal with this flesh. &gt;&gt; I deal with carnal natures. &gt;&gt; But I've got something inside of me that's changing me. &gt;&gt; It's transforming me. &gt;&gt; Remember now, a foolish virgin is the church. And out of the church, he calls a bride. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; Let's not just say, "Well, praise God. I'm in that church." Make your calling and your election. Sure. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just say, "Well, I'm I'm glad that I'm called." No, I want to go to election. The majority of the believers today within the message are church. You can look and see they're becoming more foolish. Instead of closer to God, they're more lukewarm. Instead of being more obedient to the word, we see their lukewarmness. We see the fashion of the world. We see the sisters battling it. the brothers with their haircuts and growing their hair stylish like the perverts of this world. And you got your baggy pants or you got your skin down wiener pants. &gt;&gt; Yeah, sisters, you could say amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because we're on your case enough. What about them? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You young boys, &gt;&gt; let me tell you. You don't think I I don't see you with the way you dress and your baggy pants and everything. Don't be foolish. &gt;&gt; If I could provoke you unto good works, I would. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if I if I force a law upon them, they get resentful. I tell you what, you take off them Becky pants, you cut that hair, you do this and that, they'll have the same spirit I had before he got converted. You cut my hair, I'll kill you. &gt;&gt; So what you do? When I came into this message, I had long hair and I wasn't going to let nobody cut it. I told my dad, "You forced me all these years to cut my hair. I'm gonna walk on it before I cut it. Don't you come around my house, you pervert." I said, "That's fine." Six, eight months later, come Christmas, my dad called me up. Are you coming home? No, I got long hair. Yeah, son. It come home anyway. I got long hair, Dad. My dad wasn't a Christian. You know what my dad said? I love you anyways. &gt;&gt; Wow. Dad, you love me anyways. Okay, I'll be there. Can you love the sinner and hate the sin? &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Philippians 3 and13. Brethren, I count not myself to have &gt;&gt; apprehend, &gt;&gt; but this one thing I do, &gt;&gt; forgetting those things which are behind, &gt;&gt; and reaching forth under those things which are before, I press towards the mark. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded. &gt;&gt; Lord help me to be thus minded. &gt;&gt; How can you tell foolish from wise? Watch their life. &gt;&gt; Look at the fruits. If they say they believe the message and they don't follow the word of God, &gt;&gt; they're foolish. &gt;&gt; They honorth God with their lips, but their heart is far from him. In vain do they worship God. Amen. I want to be a true believer. Don't you? &gt;&gt; I want to be that elect seed. I want to be like Enoch. I want to be like Abraham. I want to be like those of old that press towards the mark of the high calling through this dark and dying age. I tell you, if if the world right now, if they're over there, 150,000 people are praising a a young man 31 years of age who just said, "I want to be a witness for Christ." &gt;&gt; And he didn't mind debating. I I may not agree with his platform, but I sure do like his stand. He was not ashamed. &gt;&gt; And I say, God, let me not be ashamed &gt;&gt; to align myself up with this message. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of it. &gt;&gt; I am not. I am not I'm not ashamed of this gospel. Let me stand. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to debate it. I'm just saying let me stand and be a witness. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know if they are having a memorial service for brother Biscll today or not. I don't know. I already had &gt;&gt; next Sunday. Lord willing. if I can, I'll be up there next Sunday because I was told it might be today. And I thought, wouldn't it be kind of ironic that you got a memorial service for Charlie Kirk and one of a end time witness? Let me tell you, &gt;&gt; brother Biscll, &gt;&gt; what a witness. &gt;&gt; I tell you, he was not afraid to let his voice blend with the voice of the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I thought if these two memorials are going on at the same time, I thought here is one out here and and denominational. Excuse me. I'm not making I'm not looking down. But I want you to understand we're raised above &gt;&gt; that standard &gt;&gt; by the voice of the seventh angel. When he should begin to sound, you know what he was doing? He was finishing the mystery. &gt;&gt; He was preaching a message that identified &gt;&gt; elected. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I say just enough of the word. If they're elected, they'll catch it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you can say amen to that? When I heard the voice, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; of that seventh angel, &gt;&gt; there was something inside of me that gripped me. &gt;&gt; It caught me. &gt;&gt; If you've been caught up by that seventh angel, you'll be caught up in the rapture when it comes. &gt;&gt; How do I know? I'm already caught. &gt;&gt; I'm already being reeled in. &gt;&gt; And when the rapture happens, I want to be one of those which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord will not hinder those which sleep. &gt;&gt; We caught up together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Biscll's over there shaking hands. &gt;&gt; He stood for this gospel. May we stand for this gospel. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand together this this morning. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open the eyes of my heart. I want to see you. I want to see you. Open the eyes of my heart, Lord. Open the eyes of my heart. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see you. Yes, I &gt;&gt; I want to see to see you high and lifted up. will see you high and lifted up. Oh, shining in the light of your glory.

Brother Ron will be doing a baptism shortly. But before we go, I want to sing that song of Ruth. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes. Is your life saying yes to his will this morning? The song of Ruth says, I'll say yes. Oh, I'll say yes. Not my voice but my life. I'll say yes. Oh to your will, Lord. I'll say yes. Where you? Oh, we just heard about the power of it. I will. [Music] Oh, I'll see. Lord, I'll see. Can you lift your hands and say it as a declaration today? Say yes, Lord. I will. I will. I say yeah. Oh hallelujah of your will, Lord. Oh, I'll say yes. Hallelujah. With me. [Music] Oh, I will go. I'll say yes. I'll say yes. &gt;&gt; Before we all go to the courtyard for the baptism, one last song. We need you, Lord. We need you, Lord.
