[29:10] And
[29:11] uh very very familiar
[29:15] scripture
[29:17] 16:15 I said behold I come as a
[29:21] thief. Blessed is he that watchth and
[29:25] keepeth his garments lest he walk naked
[29:29] and they see his shame.
[29:33] Revelation 19 verse 7. Let us be glad
[29:38] and rejoice and give honor to him for
[29:41] the marriage of the lamb is come and his
[29:44] wife hath made herself ready. Amen. And
[29:48] may the Lord add a blessing upon the
[29:50] reading of his word. You may now be
[29:52] seated. So I will title this uh little
[29:55] thought that God put in my heart. Behold
[29:58] I come as a thief. Amen. And the subject
[30:02] is the secret catching away of the
[30:05] bride.
[30:06] And we know that this book of revelation
[30:08] a special book. Amen. This is not a book
[30:12] for everybody. This is a book just for a
[30:15] special class of people.
[30:17] Cuz this book is a revelation of Jesus
[30:20] Christ. This is not a revelations of any
[30:23] denomination. It is not revelations of
[30:26] any uh ministers. But it is it's not
[30:29] even the revelation of John. But it is
[30:31] the revelation of Jesus Christ given to
[30:35] John. That's right. And it was signified
[30:38] by angel. Amen. Amen. So God's always
[30:42] confirming it with these angels. And I
[30:45] told
[30:45] brother Steve before we come up here. So
[30:48] there's a lot of bacon seat and we know
[30:51] that was angels sitting among us
[30:52] tonight. Do you believe it? Wow. We
[30:56] always believe it. So that's why we
[30:58] enjoy even if there's is full or not
[31:00] full we still enjoy because we are in
[31:02] the presence of the Lord. That's right.
[31:04] And the scripture said that the angel of
[31:06] the Lord encamp round about them that
[31:09] fear him. So if there's a vacant seat,
[31:11] there's angel that is encamp guarding
[31:14] your seat. Thank you. So you need to be
[31:17] sensitive tonight. Amen. Don't look at
[31:21] anybody else. Just look at the word
[31:23] tonight. That's right.
[31:25] So the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[31:27] God gave unto
[31:29] him, amen, to John, a special class of
[31:33] people. This is not for everybody. And
[31:35] John, as the prophet said, which is a
[31:37] type of Jesus or is a type of the bride.
[31:39] Amen. Amen. And it was not only Jesus
[31:42] Christ that's is revealing it to John,
[31:45] but he sent an angel and signified it.
[31:48] And we know that this angel is not an
[31:50] earthly or or heavenly angel but an
[31:52] earthly angel that even John when he saw
[31:56] it in Revelation 19:10 he was about to
[31:59] worship that angel the signifying
[32:02] angel. Revelation 19:10 and I fell at
[32:05] his feet to worship him. Thus the
[32:08] tendency of men is to
[32:10] worship is to worship. Especially if you
[32:14] have a a good understanding of the word
[32:17] or whatever status you are in in life
[32:20] especially when you are bringing the
[32:21] word of God somebody is going to worship
[32:24] you. That's right. They're going to
[32:26] worship brother Brandham because of many
[32:29] special manifestation in his life.
[32:33] They're going to worship him and some
[32:34] even worship him as of the Lord Brandham
[32:37] Christ.
[32:40] Amen. So this is John and he saw the
[32:43] revelation of Jesus Christ and he saw
[32:45] the signifying angel and he was about to
[32:48] run and worship him and the signifying
[32:52] angel said and he said unto me see thou
[32:56] do it not. Amen. All right. So this is
[33:00] not an angel and and heavenly angel
[33:02] because don't worship me and he said I
[33:06] am thy fellow servant and of thy
[33:08] brethren that have testimony of Jesus
[33:12] worship God. Amen. So a real messenger a
[33:15] real angel is always pointing them to
[33:18] God. That's right. Amen. There's only uh
[33:21] one that is worthy of our worship and
[33:25] praise and that is God the Almighty God.
[33:27] Amen. And worship God for the testimony
[33:30] of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
[33:35] So we are reading praise God that the
[33:38] the the book of revelation which is the
[33:40] revelation of Jesus Christ which is the
[33:42] book of prophecy. Amen. So in revelation
[33:45] chap 16 it was Jesus Christ that's
[33:49] catching the attentions of John. He said
[33:53] behold pay attention John.
[33:57] And he said I come
[34:01] not I will
[34:02] come or will be coming or about to come
[34:07] personally I come. Amen.
[34:12] When is when is that time that I will
[34:16] come? It is today. Amen. I come in the
[34:21] present tense.
[34:23] That's right. So we are not waiting for
[34:25] him somebody else because he said I
[34:27] come.
[34:30] That means that this scripture is being
[34:33] fulfilled in our very eyes. Praise the
[34:36] Lord. I come as a thief.
[34:41] He didn't call the attention of John and
[34:44] say, "Okay,
[34:45] John, I am a thief."
[34:50] Because a thief always strike secretly.
[34:55] A thief don't always don't always
[34:57] announce his presence. Amen. I'm coming
[34:59] to steal.
[35:01] Secretly, but is ask a tip. So this is
[35:04] the secret coming of Christ being
[35:06] fulfilled in our
[35:08] day. Amen. So he said that blessed he
[35:11] that watchth and keepeth his garment. So
[35:14] he will be a secret coming of Christ. So
[35:16] he he get admonition that we need to be
[35:19] watchful. Amen. Amen. And keep it our
[35:23] garment and our garment is a covering.
[35:26] So we need to keep our garment pure and
[35:30] that garment is the revelation of the
[35:31] word of God that be revealed to us while
[35:34] waiting for his coming because he will
[35:36] come as a secret coming. So we need to
[35:38] wash oursel and keep our garment clean
[35:41] or
[35:42] else he would walk naked
[35:46] and they see his shame. So we see this
[35:49] is the secret coming cuz the brother
[35:52] brother Brennham or even the scripture
[35:54] tell us that there is a three coming of
[35:55] Christ.
[35:58] So his first coming to earth he comes to
[36:01] pay the price of redemption.
[36:06] He was born in a manger, grow up and
[36:09] offer his life as a sacrifice in order
[36:12] for to redeem his bride. Ephesians 1:7,
[36:15] whom we have redemption through his
[36:17] blood, the forgiveness of sin according
[36:20] to the riches of his grace. For without
[36:23] the shedding of the blood, there is no
[36:24] remission of sin. So he need to the God
[36:27] that in the old testament need to
[36:30] manifest himself in the flesh for the
[36:33] purpose of redemption because without
[36:35] the shedding of blood there is no
[36:37] remission of sins. Then the second
[36:39] coming to earth he come to unite with
[36:41] his gentile bride and still heal away in
[36:45] the rapture.
[36:47] This coming is not a corporal coming of
[36:51] Christ but this coming is the revealing
[36:54] of the son of man. Amen. And the all the
[36:58] mystery truth that being revealed and
[37:00] this is the secret coming of Christ in
[37:03] these last days. And the third coming he
[37:06] will come for the last time with his
[37:08] gentile bride to rule and reign upon the
[37:11] earth. Fulfilling Revelation chapter
[37:14] 20 verse 4. So if you have time you can
[37:18] read Revelation
[37:20] 20:4. There's a thrones a plural and one
[37:24] sitting on the thrones and they re with
[37:26] Christ a thousand years during the
[37:27] rebellion reign.
[37:31] So most denominational Christian only
[37:33] know about two comingings of Christ and
[37:36] that is when he come in the manger is
[37:39] that right then come for the judgment
[37:44] and that is why they can't make a lot of
[37:48] the scripture fit because they don't
[37:50] realize that there are three coming of
[37:55] Christ but we know because we have a
[37:57] prophet in these last days. Thank you
[37:59] Lord. And so if we are living in the
[38:02] time and we know we are now living in
[38:03] the second coming of Christ of the Lord
[38:06] but you don't know what this coming
[38:09] looks like scripturally then you will
[38:12] certainly miss that's right seeing it in
[38:15] reality form
[38:17] because this is a secret coming. All the
[38:20] denominations are looking for his second
[38:22] coming and that is during the judgment
[38:25] time. But the second coming he will come
[38:28] as a thief in the night. It is a secret
[38:31] coming.
[38:33] And the prophet preached in the uh uh
[38:36] the 10 virgins. He said now
[38:40] remember as I've said everything in
[38:43] three. His coming is in three. The first
[38:46] time he came to redeem his bride. The
[38:49] second time he come to catch the bride.
[38:52] Amen. And that is to fulfill also 1
[38:55] festival 4:16-17
[38:58] like a love affair
[39:02] comes around steal her out of a
[39:04] nighttime and take her away from the
[39:06] world. Amen.
[39:09] Meet him in the air. So he's quoting
[39:11] first Thessalonian 4:16. Amen.
[39:15] The secret coming of the Lord. The
[39:17] second time he come is to receive his
[39:19] bride. First time to redeem her, second
[39:22] time to receive her. And the third with
[39:25] her king and queen.
[39:28] Hallelujah. Amen. So this sequence event
[39:34] denominational churches don't even know
[39:36] about this the three coming of Christ.
[39:40] But we thank God that we have a prophet
[39:42] in these last days. Amen. Amen. the
[39:45] manifestation of the son of man to
[39:47] reveal the word of God. Remember he he
[39:50] he he fulfilled two things. Malachi 4 5
[39:54] and 6, Revelation
[39:55] 10:7. And with this divine revealing
[39:59] truth, it it will literally turn the
[40:02] heart of the children back to the
[40:04] father. In other words, because of the
[40:06] revelation of truth, it will give us a
[40:08] rapturing faith. Yes. And rapturing
[40:12] faith is a theological word but it means
[40:15] catching away.
[40:17] Spiritually speaking when the revealed
[40:19] word comes upon our our life it really
[40:23] catch us from dead denomination.
[40:26] Not only spiritually but there will be a
[40:28] physical praise God changing of our
[40:30] bodies. Hallelujah. And so if a person
[40:33] was to look for a public
[40:36] display of this great event of second
[40:38] coming of Christ as a tip in the night,
[40:41] then you would never see it because a
[40:43] tip does not announce his coming or
[40:47] doesn't make a sense. Yes. And announce
[40:50] his coming. But he goes about his
[40:52] business in quietness
[40:55] and a secret. And so the marriage
[40:58] ceremony of Christ to his bride at this
[41:01] time of his second coming to earth will
[41:03] happen in a silent and invisible way and
[41:08] it will be completely invisible and
[41:10] unseen event to the outside world. So
[41:13] that's why the prophet preached there is
[41:15] now an invisible union between the
[41:18] bridegroom
[41:20] and the bride. Hallelujah. Not only a
[41:23] title of the sermon but as as always
[41:25] brother Ron said it is it is a
[41:27] declaration
[41:29] that something is happening in our
[41:32] generation. There is a marriage.
[41:36] Hallelujah. That is going on right now.
[41:39] And the prophet
[41:41] said what marriage a
[41:45] couple is their bow to each other.
[41:49] If you vow to marry your your your
[41:53] partner that is a binding vow.
[41:59] And sometime we call that after that
[42:02] engagement.
[42:03] So after your engagement you are already
[42:06] considered married. Yes. But you cannot
[42:09] live together unless the proper wedding
[42:11] ceremony as a witness. Amen. As a
[42:14] manifestation your love for each other.
[42:17] Yes. But if you are engaged and you
[42:20] marry another, then you are committing
[42:23] adultery. That's right.
[42:26] That's right. Because your bow is
[42:28] already a marriage. Just like when you
[42:30] married or accept Christ as your
[42:32] personal savior, then you marry the
[42:34] denominational
[42:37] church, going to a denominational church
[42:39] as your husband, then you are committing
[42:41] adultery spiritually
[42:43] speaking. Yes sir. Amen. So marriage
[42:48] take place and that is by your bow
[42:51] because your b your your
[42:53] bow is so binding that it you can say
[42:58] till death do us part. That's right in
[43:02] poorer in richer in good health in in
[43:06] bad health in good times or bad times.
[43:08] Amen. You have a commitment to each
[43:11] other and we our commitment is to serve
[43:13] Christ with all our heart, with all our
[43:15] mind and with all Christ. We are already
[43:17] married spiritually by the bow that we
[43:20] receive his word and we are waiting
[43:22] praise God for the marriage supper of
[43:24] the lamb.
[43:28] Glory in the message the word is falling
[43:32] apart. You say, "Brother Bernham, a
[43:34] while ago when you said the church would
[43:37] go and we would
[43:40] know." He said, "Oh yes, the Bible said
[43:44] it." So there is a
[43:47] secret the uh the message the word is
[43:50] falling apart. I don't know if they
[43:52] don't know but but you say, "Brother
[43:54] Bham, a while ago when you said the
[43:56] church would go and we wouldn't know."
[43:58] He said, "Oh yes, the Bible say it." No,
[44:01] they won't know nothing about it. Is a
[44:04] secret coming. He comes in a secret and
[44:08] steal away his church.
[44:11] Take her away like a book. I read one
[44:14] time of Romeo and Juliet. Amen. So a
[44:18] prophet is also reading a love story
[44:21] book. Romeo and Juliet. I think a 16th
[44:24] century kind of book written by William
[44:29] Shakespeare. But actually it is a tragic
[44:33] love stories. Amen. But he readed it
[44:37] just like Romeo. Both of families are
[44:39] fighting one another but the the the
[44:42] children both are so in love with one
[44:44] another and Romeo still Juliet. Amen. So
[44:50] I am amazed that brother Brandham is
[44:52] also reading this one and even type it
[44:54] in his message. That's right. He comes
[44:57] in a secret and steal away his church.
[44:59] Take her away like a book I read one
[45:01] time of Rome with me and Julia. See he
[45:03] comes to get her and nobody knows
[45:06] nothing about it. Amen. Hallelujah.
[45:09] Praise. So all these scriptures that we
[45:11] are about to read because we need to
[45:13] support it with the scriptures all
[45:16] pertains to the secret coming or second
[45:19] coming of the Lord. They are all zigsaw
[45:21] pieces
[45:24] that when put together reveal the event
[45:26] associated with the second coming of the
[45:29] Lord. Not one scripture can show the
[45:32] entirety of this event. Amen.
[45:35] So we don't have any pet scripture that
[45:38] say oh this is this is no it just a
[45:40] zigsaw puzzle. And it take the Holy
[45:43] Spirit to gather this one over here, one
[45:46] over here, one over here and one over
[45:49] here. And it takes the Holy Spirit of
[45:51] God who is the author of the writer of
[45:53] the book. He is the one who will
[45:55] inspired to gather us this one. Praise
[45:58] the Lord. Because there are no so many
[46:01] aspect to it. But what we do know for
[46:03] sure is that in Malachi chapter 4:5 he
[46:06] said that behold I will send you Elijah.
[46:09] There's again pay attention. Amen.
[46:14] I will send you Elijah.
[46:16] It was God who sending you. Amen. And
[46:19] this you is now become manifest. Amen.
[46:22] Not only this a prophecy, but there is
[46:24] also a people who will fulfill this
[46:27] prophecy. In other words, we are the
[46:29] people of prophecy being fulfilled in
[46:31] this last days. Because we cannot
[46:33] receive this Elijah unless hallelujah,
[46:35] you are part of this prophecy. Why you
[46:38] receive this? Because you are part and
[46:40] you need to fulfill this part. Amen.
[46:42] because I will send Elijah to you before
[46:46] the coming of the great and dreadful day
[46:48] of the Lord. Amen. So an Elijah is
[46:51] assigned to each generation as a mercy
[46:54] and judgment. Amen. So he said Elijah
[46:58] before the great and dreadful day of the
[47:00] Lord. Amen. Thank you Lord. And it is
[47:02] mercy to those who will receive it and
[47:04] judgment to those who will reject the
[47:06] message of that prophet. But I believe
[47:08] as a bride of Jesus Christ, we cannot
[47:12] help it but to receive the message of
[47:14] the hour. Praise the Lord. Thank you,
[47:17] Jesus. In Matthew chapter 25:6, so after
[47:21] Matthew 24, which is the revealing of
[47:24] the seven seals, so Matthew 25, after
[47:26] the revealing of the seven seals, praise
[47:28] God, the bridegroom cometh and callth
[47:30] for his bride. And at midnight there was
[47:34] a cave made. Behold the bridegroom
[47:36] cometh going out to meet him. So this is
[47:39] a midnight hour. Amen. That is calling
[47:42] for the bride. Come ye here. So there at
[47:45] we know that there was a a wise and
[47:47] there is a foolish virgins and the
[47:49] foolish virgins. They are virgins you
[47:51] know and they have oil.
[47:54] But when the bridegroom cometh their
[47:58] oil cannot go all the way. They have
[48:02] just oil enough for the day. Oil for
[48:05] Luther's day, oil for Wesley's day and
[48:09] oil for Pentecost that that just enough
[48:11] for their day. But the bridegroom cometh
[48:15] and they ask give us no I we cannot give
[48:18] any oil anymore. Amen. Because this is
[48:22] only for a specific
[48:25] people of God for the bride. Praise the
[48:27] Lord. First Thessalonian 4:16. For the
[48:29] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[48:32] with a shout. So this is the fulfillment
[48:35] of our scriptures. It all tie ups
[48:37] together.
[48:40] From heaven with a shout, with a voice
[48:42] of archangel, and with the trump of God,
[48:44] and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[48:47] And when he descended, he did all this
[48:50] treating. Amen. Amen. He didn't shout
[48:53] then wait for how many years then a
[48:56] voice then wait another year then
[48:58] there's a trump when he descended all
[49:01] these three things. Hallelujah. He shout
[49:03] with this the message of the hour the
[49:05] voice of the resurrection. Amen.
[49:07] Hallelujah. And when the trump the
[49:09] gathering of all the bride and one of
[49:11] these days we will be changed in a
[49:12] moment in the twinkling of an eye.
[49:14] Praise the Lord. And he tied up in
[49:16] Revelation 10:1. And I saw another
[49:18] mighty angel come down from heaven
[49:20] clothed with a cloud and rainbow was
[49:22] upon his head and his face was it were
[49:24] the sun and his feet as pillars apart.
[49:27] Amen. This angel was Christ.
[49:30] And we have seen this cloud appear in
[49:33] reality form in our day. Amen. And some
[49:37] of us were not born yet during the
[49:39] appearing of that cloud.
[49:44] Well, I was born in 1953.
[49:48] by uh uh 58 but I haven't got the chance
[49:51] to see it what happening
[49:54] but my time has come that even though I
[49:56] didn't see it physically
[50:00] but when I read the book I just believe
[50:02] it
[50:04] I cannot explain it
[50:07] I just read it in the book in the life
[50:09] story in the magazine they say this is
[50:10] the you turn it and it's the the face of
[50:13] Christ I just believe it cannot explain
[50:15] it I just believe it. Hallelujah. So I
[50:19] cannot say no. I cannot run away from
[50:21] it. I believe it. And the scriptures
[50:24] say, "Blessed are they that have an ear
[50:26] that can hear and see eye that can see."
[50:32] Just like Mary when the when when the
[50:34] angel comes and blessed art thou
[50:39] Mary because the child that will be born
[50:42] in thee will be called the son of God.
[50:44] Amen.
[50:46] as brother Chad.
[50:48] Well, she was a virgin for how many
[50:51] years? There is that there's
[50:55] only she was only the one that testify
[50:58] about it, right? For hundred and hundred
[51:01] of years. Now come this virgin woman
[51:02] that say that I I am pregnant by the
[51:05] Holy Ghost. No one will believe her and
[51:08] she cannot even explain it herself. How
[51:11] did it comes? Where did it come from?
[51:13] Where did angel come? is the name of the
[51:14] angel. She don't even know how to
[51:17] explain it.
[51:19] But yet she believe it and continue
[51:22] believing. Even though there's so much
[51:24] ridicule around him, they cannot believe
[51:26] it. She just keep on believing and
[51:28] walking by the revelation
[51:30] until it's time that they saw
[51:34] that his body is changing.
[51:37] He's carrying the word that his test his
[51:40] testimony is now being made manifest.
[51:44] Just like each and every one of us.
[51:46] Hallelujah. We saw the mighty angel. We
[51:48] saw the the the word of God in this last
[51:51] day. Sometimes some people will ridicule
[51:53] us. They didn't believe our testimony.
[51:55] But nevertheless, our life changed.
[51:58] Praise the Lord. And we are not serving
[52:01] praise God a man.
[52:04] We love the prophet so much. Yes sir.
[52:07] And a lot of them ridicule him to be a
[52:09] false prophet. any bad names addressed
[52:12] to him. But I praise God without that
[52:14] prophet I cannot even see myself serving
[52:18] the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. But
[52:20] because of his ministry I come to love
[52:22] our Lord Jesus Christ. My life changed
[52:24] and I cannot explain it.
[52:27] From being a drunker that smoker I turn
[52:30] into different men and I don't know why
[52:33] I become a brand new man.
[52:36] The only thing I know is I believe the
[52:38] message of the hour. the message of the
[52:39] Lord Jesus Christ.
[52:42] Hallelujah.
[52:46] Hallelujah. So there are many ways that
[52:48] God convey truth to us. He convey truth
[52:52] in the story in the Old Testament. He
[52:54] can convey truth in the form of the
[52:57] prophecy. He can convey truth by way of
[53:00] the stories.
[53:02] He can convey truth by ways of parables,
[53:05] by ways of revelation or anything that
[53:08] will just attract our attention and
[53:10] truth. Even our pain and suffering and
[53:12] trials
[53:15] will open up sometimes understanding.
[53:17] Some of us came to know the Lord Jesus
[53:19] Christ by way of sickness,
[53:22] no suffering until God open something.
[53:26] Some by way of miracles, some by way of
[53:29] accident, some by way of somebody
[53:31] testified,
[53:32] somebody uh give give a spoken word or
[53:36] something. God, hallelujah, knows the
[53:39] language of each and every one of us.
[53:44] Thank you, Lord.
[53:46] God is able to communicate in all these
[53:49] many languages of ways to impart truth
[53:52] and revelations to us. Amen. So that's
[53:54] why our experience not so different
[53:57] but we praise the same God.
[54:00] We come from different culture,
[54:02] different nation but we testify of one
[54:04] God.
[54:12] So we need to learn and to understand
[54:14] the language of God of how he
[54:16] communicates truth. You know he come he
[54:19] will come down to earth with a little
[54:21] book open to reveal the names of his
[54:25] subject. So that's why the very purpose
[54:27] of the opening of the seven seals to
[54:29] reveal the name of his subject which is
[54:32] his bride. Amen.
[54:36] And at this second coming Christ will
[54:38] come to be united in a marriage to his
[54:41] bride by an invisible union. Thank God.
[54:46] Amen.
[54:48] All the scripture are showing us of this
[54:50] event that are to take place at this
[54:52] second coming. And we have also
[54:55] revel
[54:57] 30. Amen. And and we can see that all
[55:01] the scriptures that we usually are
[55:04] quoting are scripture that is being
[55:07] fulfilled in our day. Amen. Sometime we
[55:10] just bypass it. It's just an ordinary
[55:12] but is something that will connect us to
[55:15] Christ. Thank you Lord. So in revelation
[55:19] chapter 19 verse 7 let us be glad and
[55:23] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[55:25] marriage of the lamb is come and his
[55:26] wife hath made herself ready. What make
[55:29] us
[55:31] ready because of the revealed word that
[55:33] we are accepting because of the revealed
[55:36] word that we are eating. Because of the
[55:38] revealed word that we are partaking.
[55:40] Thank you. Amen. Revelation 10. Take the
[55:42] book and eat it. Amen. So you need
[55:46] action.
[55:49] You need to take it. Amen. You need an
[55:52] action. You need dedication. You need to
[55:55] to to move.
[56:00] Take it and don't display it.
[56:05] Take it and put it in one of the
[56:08] storage. take it and eat it
[56:12] so that it can make you prepared and
[56:14] ready.
[56:17] So in Matthew chapter 16 verse4 he said
[56:20] that a wicked and adulterous generation
[56:23] seeketh after a
[56:25] sign. So we are now living in a wicked
[56:28] and adulterous generation.
[56:31] Sometimes when we quote something like
[56:32] that wicked and adulteration sometimes
[56:38] people are saying that you are stepping
[56:41] on my
[56:44] to you don't need to quote
[56:47] that but we cannot help if it's the
[56:50] spirit of
[56:52] God give us the inspiration as a
[56:55] ministers
[56:56] we are not to apologize that's right
[56:59] because it is written in the scripture.
[57:02] This is not our scripture. This is not
[57:04] our idea. This is not our purpose. This
[57:07] is the word of God. The wicked and
[57:09] adultery rich generation are they are
[57:12] seeking for a sign.
[57:17] And there shall no sign be given unto it
[57:19] but the sign of the prophet
[57:22] Jonah. And he said, "And he left them
[57:25] and departed." You know the sign of the
[57:27] prophet Jonah was a sign of resurrection
[57:31] and his message also brought about
[57:33] resurrection in this day. Amen. And
[57:36] remember Jonah is a gentile prophet and
[57:39] we have also a gentile prophet in this
[57:41] generation. And he is a sign of an
[57:44] impending judgment. Amen. It's a sign of
[57:48] resurrection because we are we live in
[57:50] sin and come to the word speaking lies.
[57:52] We have no uh uh in Ephesians he said
[57:55] that but God who is rich in mercy for
[57:57] his great love where we he love us.
[57:59] Ephesians
[58:00] 2:4 and five even when we were dead in
[58:04] sin. Yes. Sin means separation.
[58:08] Amen. From God
[58:11] had weakened us together with Christ.
[58:14] Yes. And had raised us up together and
[58:17] made us sit together in heavenly places.
[58:20] Amen. So we have a gentile prophet in
[58:23] the our day and he is a major prophet.
[58:27] Amen. Not only are the ordinary prophet
[58:30] because there's a lot of prophet going
[58:32] on around here. That's right. Amen.
[58:34] Profess to be prophet. There are prophet
[58:37] but we have a major prophet in these
[58:39] last days.
[58:41] And a major prophet is always a sign of
[58:44] a impending judgment. Right. So a
[58:48] prophet in this generation is a sign of
[58:50] mercy.
[58:52] Thank you Lord to those people but so a
[58:55] sign of judgment to those who reject it.
[58:57] Amen.
[59:00] There is always a uniting time that
[59:04] follows this great sign of a prophet.
[59:07] Amen.
[59:10] So something is happening. Not only we
[59:13] rec
[59:13] recognize a c a prophet in the land, we
[59:17] only reveal the mystery truth of the
[59:21] word but there is also a uniting time.
[59:26] Hallelujah. Amen. After the
[59:30] prophet and we want to be sure that we
[59:33] are of this uniting of God being united
[59:37] with his bride. Amen. The message
[59:39] uniting
[59:42] time he preached it in 1963. You know
[59:46] the when the opening of the seven seal
[59:48] it was in 1963
[59:50] and when the opening when the the the uh
[59:53] the the seals was open it's not all the
[59:57] message is not all about the
[59:59] seal because when the seal was open it
[1:00:02] continually unfolding and unfolding from
[1:00:05] 63 up to 65. Yes. It didn't stop in the
[1:00:09] opening of the seven seals. It didn't
[1:00:12] stop when the seventh angel sounded his
[1:00:14] voice, right? But it continue to unfold.
[1:00:18] Amen. Unfold because the book was never
[1:00:21] closed. It's still open. So it's keep on
[1:00:23] unfolding and unfolding. Thank you,
[1:00:26] Lord. We see nations uniting. We see the
[1:00:28] world uniting. We see
[1:00:31] communism. We see the churches uniting.
[1:00:34] And we see God uniting himself with his
[1:00:37] bride. This is something that is
[1:00:39] happening up the bride.
[1:00:43] Until he and the church is the same
[1:00:45] thing like the family together, right?
[1:00:47] Uniting themselves together. God
[1:00:50] uniting.
[1:00:52] Why? Never before since the early church
[1:00:55] age was a pillar of fire ever among the
[1:00:58] people. Amen. Never before since the
[1:01:01] early church age did they ever see the
[1:01:04] thing that we are seeing today. Amen.
[1:01:06] Yes sir. And this was only made possible
[1:01:09] when God sent the seventh seal and give
[1:01:12] us a sign by it and send the seven
[1:01:14] angels down out of heaven and come to
[1:01:17] bring back the scattered word in them
[1:01:20] denomination. And remember the ministry
[1:01:22] of the seventh angels is to gather all
[1:01:24] those loose end from those church ages.
[1:01:27] Amen. Hallelujah. And it being revealed
[1:01:30] and he said and he sends seven angels
[1:01:33] down out of
[1:01:35] heaven and come to bring back the
[1:01:37] scattered word in them denomination and
[1:01:40] it tie it back into the word of God
[1:01:43] again to bring down his holy spirit.
[1:01:48] Amen. Beautiful. This bringing down of
[1:01:51] Holy Spirit is not speaking about of the
[1:01:55] Holy Spirit or
[1:01:57] this Holy Spirit is speaking of the Holy
[1:02:03] Spirit in word revelation form. Amen.
[1:02:09] And not in anointing form as it was in
[1:02:12] the days of Pentecost because the day of
[1:02:15] Pentecost is already done. So this Holy
[1:02:17] Spirit anointing is revealing the word
[1:02:20] in these last days.
[1:02:23] Excuse me. So we see the nations
[1:02:27] uniting. Paragraph
[1:02:30] 105. We see the nations uniting. We see
[1:02:33] the word uniting. We see the churches
[1:02:35] uniting. We see the bride uniting with
[1:02:38] the word. Why? The word is God. Amen.
[1:02:43] And as the word, as the bridegroom being
[1:02:45] the word and the bride being the hearer
[1:02:48] of the word,
[1:02:50] they become together in a union. They
[1:02:54] like until a wedding. They're getting
[1:02:56] ready for a wedding and they become one.
[1:03:01] The word becomes you and you become the
[1:03:04] word.
[1:03:05] And Jesus said
[1:03:08] at that day you know what all the father
[1:03:13] is
[1:03:15] I am.
[1:03:19] Remember that Jesus Christ is the son of
[1:03:22] God.
[1:03:24] It was God made flesh but he he is not
[1:03:27] to be called the God. He was the son of
[1:03:30] God because he has a beginning and he
[1:03:32] has an ending. Yes. But we know that
[1:03:34] after the baptism in Jordan River by
[1:03:37] John the Baptist, he was not baptized
[1:03:39] for remission of sin. He was baptized to
[1:03:42] fulfill all righteousness. Hallelujah.
[1:03:44] Because John already identified because
[1:03:47] behold the lamb of God that takes away
[1:03:49] the sins of the word. And being a
[1:03:51] sacrificial lamb, he need to be washed
[1:03:54] before the sacrifice.
[1:03:56] So after his baptism,
[1:03:58] John said, "I saw the spirit of God
[1:04:00] descending from heaven." Yes. just like
[1:04:03] a dove and indwwell in that body. Yes.
[1:04:07] And he heard a voice saying, "This is my
[1:04:10] beloved son.
[1:04:12] Hear ye him." Amen. So when his ministry
[1:04:16] began, he always preached about the
[1:04:19] father. He was not preaching about his
[1:04:21] ministry. He was not preaching about the
[1:04:24] miracles. Who made the miracles? He
[1:04:26] always preach about the father. All this
[1:04:28] miracles by the father. All the father.
[1:04:30] All the father. all the father.
[1:04:35] Amen. And even said
[1:04:38] that John 14:6 he said Jesus said I am
[1:04:43] the way.
[1:04:46] Capital I. Yes sir. The great I am.
[1:04:51] That Moses met in the burning bush.
[1:04:55] I am the way.
[1:04:58] It was God in him.
[1:05:01] It's the way. So after his baptism we
[1:05:04] need to distinguish
[1:05:07] who is speaking in that body. Very good.
[1:05:11] Very good. Sometime it is the son
[1:05:13] because we cannot get away from the
[1:05:15] flesh but the flesh has his own.
[1:05:19] That's why there was a woman asking
[1:05:21] brother Brennham brother Brenn I have
[1:05:22] somewhat against you and but why why is
[1:05:26] that? Because you always brag upon Jesus
[1:05:30] as divine. We're in those scriptures
[1:05:32] telling us that he was just he he he he
[1:05:36] was just human. And brother, okay, so
[1:05:40] show me the the scripture. You know when
[1:05:44] after his missionary trip
[1:05:47] evangelism when he went home or go home,
[1:05:51] he got tired and weary.
[1:05:54] That's right. He got hungry.
[1:05:58] When his best friend Lazarus died, he
[1:06:02] wept.
[1:06:04] That means that he was not divine. Yes.
[1:06:08] He was just human. And brother Brendan
[1:06:10] just smiled. Okay. But I want to tell
[1:06:12] you his best friend Lazarus when he said
[1:06:15] Lazarus come forth.
[1:06:18] And Lazarus raised up from the dead four
[1:06:20] days ago. It was no longer a man, but it
[1:06:23] was more than a man. It was God in a
[1:06:26] man.
[1:06:28] When he turned the water into wine, that
[1:06:30] was not a man, but it was God in a man
[1:06:32] performing it. Because the Lord Jesus
[1:06:35] Christ said, "I am the way and the truth
[1:06:37] and the life." Amen.
[1:06:40] Excuse me.
[1:06:46] I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[1:06:48] And no man cometh unto the father but by
[1:06:50] me. Uh-huh. Because he was the final
[1:06:52] voice.
[1:06:55] Yes, sir. This is my beloved son.
[1:06:57] Hearing him. Don't hear about Moses.
[1:07:00] Don't hear about Elijah. Because in his
[1:07:03] baptism, Elijah and Moses was there
[1:07:05] standing. But the boy said, "This is my
[1:07:08] beloved son whom I am
[1:07:11] pleased to dwell in." Hear ye him. Amen.
[1:07:15] Beautiful. Who is that him? It was God
[1:07:18] in him.
[1:07:20] Amen. And the life no man cometh unto
[1:07:23] the father but by me. If you have known
[1:07:25] me, it takes spiritual revelation.
[1:07:31] You should have known my father also.
[1:07:33] Amen.
[1:07:36] If I say I am the bride, you need to
[1:07:39] know my bridegroom. That's right.
[1:07:43] Hallelujah. Because the bride and the
[1:07:45] bridegroom, they are one and the same.
[1:07:47] That's right.
[1:07:50] If you had known me, you should have
[1:07:52] known my father also. Henceforth ye know
[1:07:54] him and have seen him.
[1:07:58] And Philip is so wondering what is what
[1:08:01] this man is saying about I cannot
[1:08:03] understand what he's what's the logic of
[1:08:05] his uh kind of uh talking. And Philip
[1:08:09] said, Lord, show you as the father and
[1:08:11] surprise at us. And Jesus said unto him,
[1:08:14] "Have I been so long with you, and yet
[1:08:17] thou hast not known me?" Pillip,
[1:08:21] he that hath seen me hath seen the
[1:08:23] father. Amen. And how sayest thou then
[1:08:26] show us the father?
[1:08:29] And he said, believe me that I am in the
[1:08:32] father and the father in me, or else
[1:08:37] believe me for the very work's sake.
[1:08:41] In John chapter 10 verse 30, I and my
[1:08:45] father are one. Amen. Is that a very
[1:08:48] strong declaration? That's right. Then
[1:08:51] the Jew took stone and again to stone
[1:08:54] him. And Jesus answered them, "Many good
[1:08:57] works I have assued from my father. For
[1:09:00] which of those works do you ston?"
[1:09:04] And the Jew answered saying, for a good
[1:09:07] work we stoned thee not,
[1:09:11] but for blasphemy because thou being a
[1:09:14] man makest thyself God. So they missed
[1:09:18] the point. They missed the revelation
[1:09:20] because the work that he's doing it was
[1:09:22] the work of the father in him. And when
[1:09:26] he say I am the son of God, they're
[1:09:28] accusing of being a blasphemy. You're
[1:09:31] blaspheing. We we don't have any
[1:09:33] question about signs and wonders.
[1:09:36] But when you say that you are God, then
[1:09:39] it's time for us to stall him. Yes.
[1:09:43] And Jesus answered them, it is not
[1:09:46] written in your law. I said, "Ye are
[1:09:50] gods."
[1:09:53] If he called them gods, unto whom the
[1:09:55] word of God came and the scripture
[1:09:58] cannot be broken.
[1:10:02] Say ye of him whom the father hath
[1:10:04] sanctified and sent unto the word, thou
[1:10:06] blasphe because I said I am the son of
[1:10:09] God.
[1:10:11] So if we say that we are gods, somebody
[1:10:14] stumbles about that. Amen. But God is
[1:10:18] the word. Amen. And if the word is in
[1:10:21] us, we are also called God. Amen.
[1:10:24] Hallelujah. Our mindset is not God that
[1:10:26] he's a creator. I will create
[1:10:29] everything. Right? That's the mindset of
[1:10:31] denomination when they say about God.
[1:10:32] But God is in his word. The revealed
[1:10:35] world be our when you receive the word,
[1:10:38] you are being united by God the word in
[1:10:41] this last day. And you are all called
[1:10:42] God's. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Say him
[1:10:47] whom the father sanctified sent unto him
[1:10:50] for the word thou blasphemed because I
[1:10:52] said I am the son of God. If I do not
[1:10:54] the works of my father and what is the
[1:10:56] works of the father
[1:10:59] is this to believe whom God sent. Yes.
[1:11:03] What did God send in those last days?
[1:11:05] Not only a prophet but the word of God
[1:11:07] was being sent. And that is the work of
[1:11:09] God. To believe whom he sent. Amen.
[1:11:12] Amen.
[1:11:14] But if I do though you believe me not
[1:11:16] believe the works that ye may know and
[1:11:19] believe that the father is in me and I
[1:11:22] in him because I and my father are one.
[1:11:25] I am doing the works. I am doing praise
[1:11:28] God receiving the word that he's saying.
[1:11:32] So let us go back to the
[1:11:34] quotes and the word becomes you and you
[1:11:37] become the word. Jesus said at that day
[1:11:40] you know what all the father is. Amen.
[1:11:43] Now he is now explaining it. I am. Yes.
[1:11:49] And all I am. You are. Amen.
[1:11:54] And all you are. I am. Amen. In that day
[1:11:59] you will know that I am in the father.
[1:12:01] The father in me. I in you and you in
[1:12:04] me. See
[1:12:06] or do you understand it?
[1:12:09] At that day, what day? This day
[1:12:13] we find out the great hidden mysteries
[1:12:15] of God being revealed. Oh my, I lie that
[1:12:20] this day the scripture is being
[1:12:22] fulfilled in our day. And he said, "Oh,
[1:12:24] we find out the great hidden mysteries
[1:12:26] of God being revealed." Now,
[1:12:29] there's so many mysteries that being
[1:12:31] revealed in this last day. The mystery
[1:12:33] of the serpent seed, the mysteries of
[1:12:36] the godhead, the mystery of grace, the
[1:12:38] mystery that there is no eternal son of
[1:12:40] God, the mystery of there is no eternal
[1:12:42] lake of fire. The mystery there is no
[1:12:45] eternal lake of fire. Amen. All this
[1:12:48] mystery that is being revealed. But the
[1:12:50] greatest mystery of all is knowing who
[1:12:52] you are. Because all the father is I am
[1:12:56] and all that I am. You are. I am. And
[1:12:59] all that you are. I am. I am. This day
[1:13:02] the scripture is being fulfilled.
[1:13:10] If you are not open by this word,
[1:13:13] don't worry.
[1:13:15] Because if you are the bride, you will
[1:13:17] go it. You will catch it. You will catch
[1:13:20] it. You will catch it. There is a
[1:13:21] catching up.
[1:13:24] No one is being left behind.
[1:13:26] But not all are the same grows together.
[1:13:31] Sab is still small but nevertheless
[1:13:33] remember that igllet eat meat when they
[1:13:36] are still igllet so we have a spiritual
[1:13:39] food in due season it's all meat and
[1:13:42] meat and meat
[1:13:44] but we have season to grow
[1:13:47] thank you nevertheless the revelation is
[1:13:49] in there already
[1:13:57] hallelujah so continue
[1:14:00] on the uniting science of
[1:14:05] time. Science and man and nation has
[1:14:08] produced the fearful sign in the
[1:14:11] skies. Do you notice this last few month
[1:14:14] or years that you can always see in the
[1:14:16] news different sighting in the in the
[1:14:19] skies?
[1:14:21] Some say that it's a UFO identified
[1:14:24] flying object, some rocket or something
[1:14:26] like that.
[1:14:28] That's exactly right. Now, fearing one
[1:14:30] another. And there's been a heavenly
[1:14:33] sign, you know, they they they got a
[1:14:37] sign in heaven, too. A fearful sign. A
[1:14:40] man in an astronaut might have an atomic
[1:14:44] missile and could drop and destroy the
[1:14:46] whole
[1:14:46] nation. Get up in an astronaut and stand
[1:14:49] out there and there ain't nothing
[1:14:51] keeping them from doing it. And they're
[1:14:54] doing it right now. America, China,
[1:14:57] Russia, everybody seems
[1:14:59] to rush putting their own satellite
[1:15:03] whatsoever in the sky.
[1:15:06] They can sure do it. They anytime they
[1:15:09] want to. They can bring her into dust if
[1:15:12] they want to. They can
[1:15:13] bring her to dust the earth.
[1:15:18] But in 15 minutes from now and then
[1:15:21] what one can do the other one that way
[1:15:24] too.
[1:15:27] So you see the tension all around us
[1:15:30] right now. So we can just feel that that
[1:15:35] the earth is will not last very long.
[1:15:38] Amen.
[1:15:41] So if we see the news the sign if there
[1:15:43] is not something in your heart bubbling
[1:15:48] you need to seek more of God
[1:15:52] because said when you see all these
[1:15:54] things you need to look up you need to
[1:15:57] have rejoice because what you see is all
[1:16:00] fulfillment of the scripture
[1:16:05] and then what can do the other one they
[1:16:07] that so you see that they got assigned
[1:16:09] But the kind of sign makes them scared.
[1:16:12] They're uniting together, putting their
[1:16:14] powers together. The free world, they're
[1:16:16] putting it powers together. Communising
[1:16:19] communism putting their power together
[1:16:21] with Russia, everybody. But each one
[1:16:24] scared of the other one. It's a fearful
[1:16:28] sign. They have sign, but a fearful
[1:16:31] sign. Amen. That's the national sign.
[1:16:37] Paragraph
[1:16:40] 111. That's the national sign, the
[1:16:42] fearful in the sky. But the church has
[1:16:44] received a heavenly sign.
[1:16:47] An astronaut. Amen. Jesus Christ is the
[1:16:50] form of the pillar of fire that he was
[1:16:53] in the Old Testament. Amen. That he
[1:16:58] was that he was then he met Saul. The
[1:17:02] pillar of fire. We
[1:17:04] have a heavenly sign. An astronaut Jesus
[1:17:08] Christ is the form of pillar of fire
[1:17:10] that he was in the Old Testament. Amen.
[1:17:14] The first time the pillar of fire
[1:17:16] appear, it was in the first Exodus
[1:17:18] prophet Moses. Remember that
[1:17:22] Moses studied in the wisdom of Egypt for
[1:17:26] 40 years.
[1:17:29] But God sent him in the wilderness
[1:17:31] and take away the 40 years of his study.
[1:17:34] Amen. Then God appeared to Moses in the
[1:17:37] burning bush and commission him. Deliver
[1:17:40] my
[1:17:41] people from Egypt to the promised land.
[1:17:44] Amen. And all his knowledge and
[1:17:46] everything is got lost. Lord I I I don't
[1:17:48] know how to speak.
[1:17:52] In other words, the pillar he meet the
[1:17:53] pillar of fire. that the first time that
[1:17:56] the pillar of fire appear right nothing
[1:17:59] else then the second time appear in the
[1:18:02] new testament while Paul in his way to
[1:18:05] Damascus he meet the pillar of fire
[1:18:07] again while he's persecuting all those
[1:18:10] Christian the disciples the pillar of
[1:18:12] fire praise
[1:18:16] God appear unto him
[1:18:19] and he pulled down from the horse
[1:18:22] and he said who art thou lord
[1:18:26] I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
[1:18:29] And that same pillar of fire now appear
[1:18:32] in our day. Amen. Hallelujah. Three is a
[1:18:36] confirmation. He appeared in the old
[1:18:38] testament in Moses in New Testament in
[1:18:41] Paul. Now in the alpha age he appear
[1:18:44] again in the form of the Peter P. We we
[1:18:48] see the pictures. Amen. Amen. And that
[1:18:50] pictures is that really attract us and
[1:18:53] follow brother Brennham. It was really
[1:18:55] the message of the hour that he was
[1:18:57] preaching that attract attention not the
[1:19:00] pillar of fire in the halo.
[1:19:02] Amen.
[1:19:05] Hallelujah.
[1:19:07] But we cannot question it because
[1:19:09] science itself is the one who testify
[1:19:12] that it was the truth. Amen.
[1:19:16] So praise the Lord. He was in the Old
[1:19:20] Testament that he was then he met Saul
[1:19:22] on the road down there to Damascus. The
[1:19:24] same Jesus here today. And what does it
[1:19:28] do? Does it bring fear?
[1:19:31] Amen. It brings love. Amen.
[1:19:35] Hallelujah.
[1:19:37] It brings love. Brings you a uniting to
[1:19:40] one another. Amen. A feeling for one
[1:19:43] another. It brings the love of God. Oh,
[1:19:47] uniting us and bringing us the body of
[1:19:50] Christ into the unity as a bride. That's
[1:19:53] what is doing now. Amen. This great
[1:19:56] union. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:00] It is to gather each and every one of us
[1:20:02] from Africa, from Europe, from Asia,
[1:20:05] from Mexico. Gathering us together.
[1:20:08] Amen.
[1:20:09] and love one another by God's way not a
[1:20:11] pil
[1:20:13] but an agap love who covers all
[1:20:16] multitude of sin. Hallelujah.
[1:20:21] Hallelujah. Continue. But the church,
[1:20:23] the bride is united by one God. Amen.
[1:20:27] Not three guys, not two God, but one
[1:20:29] God. Amen. Under one
[1:20:32] spirit. The Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost
[1:20:35] is just one spirit and that the spirit
[1:20:38] of God. The spirit of God in one body in
[1:20:42] one holy union of God to be one holy
[1:20:45] bride to God. Praise the Lord. All
[1:20:47] together unity of the body, the body
[1:20:51] waiting as a bride and it is the bride
[1:20:53] as we call ourselves the bride.
[1:20:58] Are you the bride?
[1:21:01] Amen. Don't be ashamed. That's right.
[1:21:05] We have a husband that never leave us
[1:21:08] nor forsake us. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:14] We call ourselves bride for the uniting
[1:21:16] time of the bride. The church is so
[1:21:18] coming together. It should create such a
[1:21:21] love among us that we could hardly be
[1:21:24] away from one another.
[1:21:26] That's right. We just You see, you don't
[1:21:29] have to beg people to pray. That's
[1:21:32] right.
[1:21:34] You don't have to beg them to worship
[1:21:36] God. Amen. You don't have to beg them to
[1:21:40] do what's right.
[1:21:43] If they got the revelation of God in
[1:21:45] their heart, they're just so in love
[1:21:48] with him till there's nothing else. You
[1:21:51] don't pat them going to church. You
[1:21:53] don't do something and and push them go
[1:21:55] to church. No.
[1:21:58] Let the love of God's chosen to them.
[1:22:01] You don't need to pat them because they
[1:22:03] will serve God in their own voluntary
[1:22:06] will.
[1:22:10] Amen.
[1:22:18] Amen. So I'm just quoting the last two
[1:22:21] quotes and I am uh calling
[1:22:26] our musician.
[1:22:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:36] The uniting time. But the church, the
[1:22:38] bride is united by one God. Can we say
[1:22:41] amen to that? Amen. There's no other
[1:22:44] God. That's right. They may convince
[1:22:46] that there is three God, but no, we
[1:22:48] believe in only one God. That's right.
[1:22:52] Now, isn't it strange that the stars
[1:22:55] were exactly in line for three men and
[1:22:57] nobody else saw it? So, so brother B
[1:22:59] brother is speaking about the three magi
[1:23:02] that saw the stars.
[1:23:05] The aligning of three stars and that
[1:23:07] aligning point them directly to the word
[1:23:11] made flesh.
[1:23:14] Now it isn't a strange that these stars
[1:23:16] be exactly in line for three men and
[1:23:18] nobody else see it.
[1:23:21] That's why this is for a special class
[1:23:23] of people. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:27] We can see the message of the hour and
[1:23:30] we cannot question it and sometimes we
[1:23:32] cannot explain it. Amen.
[1:23:36] But no one can discourage us. Amen. To
[1:23:39] deny this word. Amen. How can you die
[1:23:42] when you are part of this word?
[1:23:45] Amen. Just like what Paul said that who
[1:23:48] can separate me from the love of God?
[1:23:51] Can sickness, famine, feal, everything,
[1:23:54] tribulations? No. No one can separate us
[1:23:57] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:24:00] the word. The Lord. Amen.
[1:24:02] See just exactly in line. Now you can be
[1:24:05] so in line with the
[1:24:08] scripture when those stars become in
[1:24:12] unity united themselves together in this
[1:24:15] constellation. Three men were also
[1:24:17] united at the same time.
[1:24:22] Hallelujah.
[1:24:24] And can you be so united with God in his
[1:24:28] word until these things become our
[1:24:30] realities? Amen.
[1:24:33] And you can see them and know that they
[1:24:35] are true. The sign of time. You might
[1:24:38] look right over the top of the it and
[1:24:41] say, "Oh, that's nonsense." But if you
[1:24:43] are a believer,
[1:24:46] [Music]
[1:24:48] you believe.
[1:24:51] For the
[1:24:52] unbeliever doesn't notice is because
[1:24:55] there is no big noise involved.
[1:24:58] There is no Hollywood band
[1:25:01] playing for the believers. We know that
[1:25:03] all the scriptures pertaining to the
[1:25:05] second coming of Christ. It what is
[1:25:08] happening right now. What a privileged
[1:25:10] people we are. Thank you. Hallelujah. We
[1:25:14] don't need to
[1:25:15] do nothing but to believe what is being
[1:25:19] revealed to us. Thank you. Because as we
[1:25:21] believe the word, we become the word
[1:25:24] being made manifest.
[1:25:26] This is not an instant growth.
[1:25:30] From an infant, you don't become matured
[1:25:34] immediate.
[1:25:35] We need to process.
[1:25:38] So we need to bear one another's burden.
[1:25:41] Comfort one another in times of trial,
[1:25:43] in times of trouble, somebody this,
[1:25:45] somebody that. We need to pray for one
[1:25:47] another
[1:25:49] because that is our life. That's right.
[1:25:52] We may not be show
[1:25:54] up but deep down in your closet you are
[1:25:57] praying for somebody else because not
[1:26:01] everybody in this physical place is the
[1:26:03] same makeup. That's right. There are
[1:26:05] those who just
[1:26:07] simple, not talking too
[1:26:11] much but in action. Amen. But there are
[1:26:15] those who are talkative, very show up.
[1:26:18] But you just need to enjoy that.
[1:26:23] But if you are a silent type, just okay,
[1:26:26] put a smile in your face.
[1:26:29] [Music]
[1:26:32] This great uniting time of this
[1:26:33] invisible union of the bride of Christ
[1:26:35] is the marriage of the lamb event that
[1:26:38] is going on right now in our personal
[1:26:40] lives. Amen. Thank you Lord. This is not
[1:26:44] about religion
[1:26:49] that we have rules and regulations to
[1:26:51] follow.
[1:26:53] This is about a love a marriage between
[1:26:57] couples. Amen. Even the newly couples
[1:27:00] they need to process still.
[1:27:05] That's why for the young people, it's
[1:27:07] better if you are planning to get
[1:27:09] married, you need to get to know what
[1:27:13] you wanted. Be friend, be become his or
[1:27:18] her best friend. Amen.
[1:27:23] Don't marry a
[1:27:24] stranger. You need you you need to get
[1:27:28] to know them.
[1:27:30] Don't rush.
[1:27:34] Be
[1:27:35] prayerful. All this great scripture and
[1:27:38] prophecy of the sec second coming of the
[1:27:40] Lord and uniting of the bride is
[1:27:41] becoming history in our lives. We are
[1:27:45] just now enjoying waiting for that the
[1:27:48] appointed time of the changing of our
[1:27:50] body because we are now in that process.
[1:27:53] We have already heard the shout the
[1:27:56] voice and we cannot even turn away from
[1:27:59] it even if we want to. Sometimes we have
[1:28:03] discouragement in this in this life and
[1:28:06] sometimes we think of maybe I will just
[1:28:08] stop. Yes,
[1:28:11] I have been so many times in my life.
[1:28:13] Maybe I will need stop
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:19] preaching because the believer they are
[1:28:22] just sitting there and just waiting for
[1:28:24] Wednesday, Sunday to listen. But for the
[1:28:27] preacher, they we we we seek the mind of
[1:28:29] God and we have so many trial that
[1:28:32] sometimes we cannot even know how to to
[1:28:35] deal with it.
[1:28:38] But nevertheless, in times of our trial,
[1:28:42] that's the time that God will pour out
[1:28:44] his anointing and see the directions
[1:28:47] where he want us to go. Thank you,
[1:28:49] Jesus. And sometimes you can feel it in
[1:28:51] your lives.
[1:28:53] What you hear is not from our physical
[1:28:57] abilities but it's from our pain and
[1:28:59] struggle
[1:29:01] and
[1:29:02] experiences that we need to know him
[1:29:05] personally before we present it unto you
[1:29:09] because we are we don't go to a Bible
[1:29:11] school or any study or AI that is soal
[1:29:14] AI give me the the quotation from this
[1:29:16] and we were just so I told even brother
[1:29:19] Steven AI is good but we cannot get
[1:29:22] inspiration
[1:29:23] AI just read the spoken word. The
[1:29:26] anointing was there. And when God give
[1:29:29] you the inspiration, he will point you
[1:29:31] in this scripture. And this another
[1:29:33] scripture, you just wonder why did I
[1:29:37] gather this zigz.
[1:29:46] Hallelujah. So last quote.
[1:29:51] This is the prayer of brother Bernham
[1:29:53] and may it also be our
[1:29:55] prayer. Oh Lord God help
[1:29:59] us everyone to unite with Christ
[1:30:03] tonight. Amen.
[1:30:05] Surrender our everything that we are
[1:30:09] everything that we have our whole soul
[1:30:12] body and mind to Jesus Christ and look
[1:30:15] for the time of that uniting.
[1:30:19] And when the trumpet of God shall sound
[1:30:21] and time shall be no more and the
[1:30:24] morning breaks eternal bright and fair.
[1:30:27] When the dead in Christ shall rise and
[1:30:29] gather over on the other
[1:30:31] shore. Hallelujah. With the bride that's
[1:30:34] alive to be caught up together. Look at
[1:30:37] the uniting. God uniting the church with
[1:30:41] his word. Amen. The word with the church

[1:32:08] the scripture, he said when you pray in
[1:32:12] Jesus' name, it just like did speaking

[1:40:03] come tonight and dismiss our service in
[1:40:06] a word of prayer? We so thankful to be
[1:40:08] gathered in his presence once again this
[1:40:10] evening and let's remember brother
[1:40:12] Warren as he ministers away on Sunday.
[1:40:15] Remember our service here, Brother
[1:40:16] Steven on Sunday. Just so thankful for
[1:40:19] what God is doing in our midst. Let's
[1:40:21] also continue to pray for our pastor
[1:40:23] while he's away. Amen. The word of
[1:40:26] God. Let's bow our hearts.
[1:40:30] Father, thank you so much Lord for the
[1:40:33] words that we heard tonight.
[1:40:36] Truly Lord, you you united us through
[1:40:40] your word,
[1:40:42] Father. Lord, that's why we cannot
[1:40:44] separate ourselves from you, Lord. Amen.
[1:40:47] Lord, we tried, but your word is always
[1:40:50] the one hunting us, Lord Jesus.
[1:40:54] And all we can say, Father, is thank you
[1:40:57] and amen.
[1:40:59] Lord, as we separated our ways, Lord
[1:41:03] Jesus, be with us. And Lord, as we
[1:41:07] remember your resurrection Sunday, Lord
[1:41:10] Jesus, I ask you,
[1:41:13] [Music]
[1:41:15] Lord give us
[1:41:17] strength, give us an understanding more
[1:41:20] of your word, Lord.
[1:41:22] that we will share your word wherever we
[1:41:24] go because you're truly Lord God. You're
[1:41:28] so good to us, Father. Lord, be with
[1:41:31] your people. Be with brother Ron and
[1:41:35] with your people here in this evening
[1:41:37] light fellowship. Lord, thank you so
[1:41:40] much for everything you have done.
[1:41:42] Restore the strength of brother Mario in
[1:41:44] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:41:47] Amen. As we go, let's sing the anchor
[1:41:49] holds. Amen.
