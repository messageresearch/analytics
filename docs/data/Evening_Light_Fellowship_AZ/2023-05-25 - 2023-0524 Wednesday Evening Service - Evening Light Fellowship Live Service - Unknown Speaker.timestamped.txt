[29:16] Stephen McNeely come on up here I want

[29:19] just come back from from Ireland and
[29:22] he's been with his family there just
[29:23] have him has gone a week but uh seemed
[29:27] like a month
[29:29] and uh anyway brother Stephen we
[29:31] appreciate you and your ministry here
[29:33] you're an integral part of our ministry
[29:36] here go ahead and greet to church here
[29:38] for us
[29:40] God bless you yeah it feels like a month
[29:44] rather than you know six days but uh
[29:47] certainly appreciate your prayers I went
[29:50] to spend a little time with Mom and Dad
[29:52] there and and I ended up spending more
[29:55] time with my dad than I did with my mom
[29:59] um which was really nice because
[30:01] I haven't gotten to spend that much time
[30:03] with my dad in a long time so
[30:06] um mom's doing good she very tired kind
[30:11] of lethargic when I had first got in
[30:13] there and by the time I had left it
[30:16] seemed like she had a lot more color in
[30:19] her face she was staying up a little bit
[30:21] later and stuff so she was definitely
[30:24] encouraged and she's she's very
[30:28] encouraged with the prayers and the love
[30:31] and the support of everybody here and so
[30:34] we certainly thank you for that and um
[30:36] you know we're just we're just walking
[30:39] by faith my mom is is a woman of faith
[30:42] and doctors have you ever heard of
[30:45] socialized medicine
[30:48] huh do you think it's a good thing
[30:51] no it's not uh so Mom and Dad they're
[30:55] still waiting on a a diagnosis of what's
[30:58] going on but good news is this she
[31:02] hasn't gotten any worse for a while and
[31:06] so that's a good thing and so we're just
[31:09] trusting in the Lord for a complete
[31:11] recovery for a total healing and her
[31:14] body and in her mind and that should be
[31:17] a living testimony of Jesus Christ so
[31:20] God bless you and this pulpiture is nice
[31:22] huh it's massive yeah very nice God
[31:25] bless you brother Ron thank you
[31:30] amen
[31:32] yeah praise the Lord
[31:34] also too I wanted to say that Sandy and
[31:37] I went with our daughter Rebecca today
[31:39] to go meet with her surgeon
[31:41] for the surgery coming up on June the
[31:44] 30th and uh uh uh the doctor had looked
[31:48] at all of the testing all of the blood
[31:51] work all of the MRI all of the
[31:53] everything that they look at prior to
[31:57] and everything is going in the right
[31:59] direction and and he said he was very
[32:02] um
[32:03] uh you know under great expectation and
[32:07] said everything is better than what he
[32:09] had expected so hey praise God uh
[32:12] doctor's doctor but God Is A Healer
[32:14] somebody say praise God Amen because you
[32:17] know what listen doctors can do their
[32:19] thing but every doctor knows they're not
[32:22] the Healer
[32:23] the medicines don't heal they heal
[32:27] but God is the Healer so we give God
[32:29] praise for that Ezra come up here
[32:31] brother you've had an issue with your
[32:33] eye there I want you to give a report on
[32:35] how that's gone everything's going in
[32:37] the right direction
[32:44] thank you brother Ron I I'll put my eye
[32:47] up patch the reason I have the patch on
[32:49] is I I lost almost complete vision and I
[32:53] had a retina tear so 30 of my eye kind
[32:56] of dropped down like a curtain or
[32:57] Eclipse so I had to go in for emergency
[32:59] surgery I missed my son's graduation and
[33:02] you know how doctors are I think the guy
[33:04] was German or something I said well can
[33:06] I delay and pray and you know my son's
[33:09] graduating tomorrow he looked at me kind
[33:11] of like brother Ron looks at you
[33:13] if we find a spot young man you will go
[33:16] to surgery okay
[33:18] so we had surgery it went really well he
[33:21] finished up and he said everything went
[33:23] perfectly now I know why I wasn't a
[33:26] doctor that was crazy he was like
[33:28] putting needles in my eye working
[33:31] through lasers and all this thing but
[33:33] they did a miraculous job I spent four
[33:35] days in a prone position
[33:37] which was pretty much like prison
[33:39] brother it was close
[33:41] I just got up to eat and use the
[33:44] restroom and then back in position
[33:46] one little joke here my father
[33:49] brother Mark he'd say Ezra just spent an
[33:52] extra 10 minutes you know it's just it's
[33:54] just time I'm getting back on the floor
[33:56] you know
[33:57] because you want to do the right thing
[33:58] because if it doesn't turn out right
[34:00] then you have to do it again
[34:02] so just praise the Lord I just had my
[34:04] follow-up yesterday with Dr Graf a
[34:07] surgeon out of Mesa and he said
[34:09] everything looks perfect my eye looks
[34:11] completely healed and we're just looking
[34:13] forward to a complete healing so we just
[34:16] give God all the praise
[34:18] amen
[34:21] that's pretty much

[37:51] that turned on
[37:54] God bless you Saints tonight it's
[37:56] wonderful to be here really enjoyed the
[37:58] opportunity we've had over the weekend
[38:00] there to be with young people and just
[38:04] really enjoyed the the fellowship and to
[38:06] see the Lord dealing with lives
[38:10] it's a
[38:12] you know it's a dark hour there's many
[38:14] challenges there's many things and
[38:17] you know you find out you're in a battle
[38:20] and you're a battle in a battle for life
[38:22] and death
[38:24] and that's not a dramatization you're
[38:27] literally Fighting For Life physically
[38:30] and spiritually as Satan's coming in and
[38:33] to see that God come in and do things
[38:35] that no man can do
[38:38] there's nothing greater I'd like to see
[38:41] so we're just praying the Lord will
[38:43] continue to to move here among us
[38:45] tonight if you have your Bible we'll
[38:47] open up to Romans the fourth chapter
[38:50] we'll get into the word here
[38:53] Romans chapter 4
[39:04] appreciate the privilege brother Ron
[39:07] giving me the minister in the Pulpit
[39:10] here
[39:11] it's a nice brand new Pulpit I
[39:13] appreciate that it's nice and wide that
[39:16] other one was a little cramped rather
[39:19] but uh
[39:21] this is downright comfortable so
[39:23] Romans the fourth chapter what shall we
[39:26] say then that Abraham our father as
[39:29] pertaining to the flesh hath found
[39:31] for If Abraham were justified by works
[39:33] he hath whereupto Glory but not before
[39:37] God
[39:38] for what saith the scripture Abraham
[39:39] believed God and it was counted unto him
[39:42] for righteousness
[39:44] now to him that worketh is the reward
[39:47] not reckoned of Grace but of debt
[39:50] but to him that worketh not not but
[39:54] believeth on him that justifieth the
[39:56] ungodly his faith is counted for
[39:59] righteousness even as David also
[40:01] described the blessedness of the man
[40:03] unto whom God imputeth righteousness
[40:05] without works saying blessed are they
[40:08] whose iniquities are forgiven and who
[40:11] sins are covered blessed is the man to
[40:14] whom the Lord will not impute sin
[40:18] and for a little contrast we'll turn to
[40:21] James the second chapter
[40:23] here we just seen Abraham looked at from
[40:26] the Divine element and here James looks
[40:30] at him from the human element
[40:32] James chapter 2
[40:35] and 14.
[40:37] James 2 and 14.
[40:41] what does it profit my brethren though a
[40:43] man say he hath faith and have not works
[40:47] can Faith save him if a brother or
[40:49] sister be naked in destitute of daily
[40:51] food and one of you say unto him depart
[40:54] in peace be warmed and filled
[40:56] notwithstanding you give them not those
[40:58] things which are needful to the body
[40:59] what does it profit even so faith if it
[41:04] hath not works is dead being alone yeah
[41:07] a man may say thou has faith and I have
[41:10] Works show me thy faith without thy
[41:13] works and I will show thee my faith by
[41:15] my works
[41:16] thou believest that there is one God
[41:19] thou doest well the Devils also believe
[41:22] and tremble
[41:24] the devil knows the power that's in this
[41:26] message of the hour friends being a
[41:27] believer of the message is good but the
[41:30] devil knows it works too
[41:34] but wilt thou know o vain man that faith
[41:37] without works is dead was not Abraham
[41:41] Our Father justified by works when he
[41:43] had offered Isaac his son upon the altar
[41:46] seeest thou how Faith wrought with his
[41:49] works and by works was Faith made
[41:52] perfect
[41:53] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[41:55] saith Abraham believed God and it was
[41:58] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[42:00] he was called the friend of God you see
[42:03] then how that by works a man is
[42:05] Justified and not by faith only
[42:11] just go to the Lord in prayer
[42:13] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[42:17] word that you have given us Lord we
[42:19] thank you for the promises that are here
[42:21] exceeding great and precious promises
[42:24] where might be maybe partakers of the
[42:26] divine nature Lord so many things here
[42:28] but I pray tonight you would anoint our
[42:31] faith to receive your word in reality
[42:35] I pray that your Holy Spirit would just
[42:37] use these lips this body For Your Glory
[42:40] May the hearts and the ears be open to
[42:42] receive whatever you would have for us
[42:45] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen
[42:49] may be seated
[42:51] the brand made the little statement
[42:52] Noah's Works expressed to man what his
[42:56] faith was in God's promise
[43:01] now God is God doesn't need your works
[43:05] to see your faith but
[43:07] your neighbor does
[43:09] kind of like Martin Luther said uh he
[43:12] says God doesn't need your good works
[43:14] but your neighbor does
[43:16] and when you have faith in God there
[43:20] will be an expression of that Faith
[43:22] there will be a reality of that faith
[43:26] your faith will have an expression and
[43:29] that will be a work
[43:31] at showing your true faith now
[43:36] faith is in case you haven't understood
[43:39] yet we're gonna be talking about faith
[43:41] tonight
[43:43] faith
[43:44] is a substance
[43:46] that means it's real
[43:48] that means
[43:50] that faith is not just something you
[43:52] imagine it's not just something that you
[43:54] know you think about it it's a sense of
[43:57] your body that declares a reality of
[44:00] something
[44:01] it's just as real as as me saying that
[44:03] this is a a piece of paper my eyes tell
[44:05] me this is a piece of paper that's real
[44:07] to me
[44:08] I know it
[44:09] just as real as my eyes telling me that
[44:12] that's a light right there
[44:14] it's just as real as as saying that I
[44:16] can feel this coat right here
[44:18] it's a reality my senses declare
[44:21] something and it's real to me totally
[44:23] real I don't care how much you might try
[44:26] to argue with me that I don't have this
[44:27] coat on
[44:29] I'm just stubborn enough not to believe
[44:31] you
[44:32] because I can feel it it's here my sense
[44:36] declares to me that it's real
[44:39] and in perfect faith brother Graham says
[44:41] see just that real as music playing it's
[44:44] just as real as a taste and anything in
[44:46] my mouth it's that real only you can't
[44:49] show it to somebody else you have it
[44:52] alone it's yours faith is the substance
[44:55] see not just a myth
[44:58] faith is more than just a thought it's
[45:01] more than just a feeling it's more than
[45:03] just a hope so it is a reality is
[45:05] something you actually have a substance
[45:08] you're holding on to and everything
[45:10] could be going contrary everything could
[45:12] be going opposite but you say but no
[45:14] my faith says opposite of that and that
[45:17] is the reality to you
[45:23] works as Faith expressed the prophet
[45:25] said he promised you the same thing
[45:29] that is if you could believe that it
[45:30] would happen if you can't believe it
[45:32] well it just won't happen now remember
[45:35] who's talking here
[45:37] the greatest profit we've seen on this
[45:38] earth now I can't make you believe
[45:42] neither can you make yourself believe
[45:45] God has to give it to you it is a gift
[45:49] of God to believe not your faith God's
[45:53] faith your intellectual Faith might
[45:56] believe it fine but unless the faith of
[45:58] God is down in your heart see your
[46:00] intellectual Faith can't accept it do
[46:03] that and just keeps believing it just
[46:05] keep believing it with all your heart
[46:07] hold on let me let me read that a little
[46:09] bit better see your intellectual faith
[46:12] can accept it do that
[46:15] you believe the word with your mind good
[46:18] that won't produce reality but that's a
[46:21] really good place to start
[46:23] do that and just keep believing it with
[46:26] all your heart until God has revealed it
[46:29] to you just keep believing it until God
[46:32] does reveal it
[46:35] intellectual faith is good but it'll
[46:38] never produce works it will never
[46:40] produce the reality but it's a starting
[46:42] place you read the word you see right
[46:44] here Isaiah 53 he was wounded for my
[46:47] transgressions he was bruised for my
[46:49] iniquities by his stripes I am healed
[46:51] the chastisement of my peace of mind was
[46:53] laid upon Him chastisement of your peace
[46:56] these things are in the scripture you
[46:58] can see it you know that that's the word
[46:59] of God and you say that is true
[47:02] now you believe that
[47:04] that's good
[47:07] but you it's not your faith it is the
[47:12] faith of the Son of God Galatians 2 20.
[47:14] the faith of the Son of God when God
[47:16] comes down and he puts something inside
[47:18] you he puts a confidence faith is a
[47:21] confidence faith is a trust faith is an
[47:23] assurance about something you know I
[47:25] have a confidence in my wife I have a
[47:28] trust in her we were just talking about
[47:30] it today you know about how I really am
[47:33] not a jealous person you know and uh my
[47:36] wife was like I don't know if I could do
[47:37] anything that would make him jealous
[47:39] like I just really don't know and uh and
[47:42] she's like you know part of it's just
[47:44] you know my masculine ego but you know
[47:47] I'm just confident that she thinks I'm
[47:49] the best thing that ever came on the
[47:50] face of the Earth and I'm not worried
[47:51] about it you know I know she loves me I
[47:53] know she adores me and and like why
[47:56] would I worry about it like I'm I'm
[47:57] secure I'm safe I'm trusting 100 and her
[48:01] love for me
[48:03] I'm not worried oh you know maybe maybe
[48:05] something's gonna happen maybe
[48:06] something's gonna happen I'm not I have
[48:08] a complete confidence and faith and
[48:10] trust in my wife
[48:13] brother Brown says if you don't have
[48:15] that you should marry her
[48:18] but when God comes down to us he comes
[48:22] and he places his confidence his
[48:25] Assurance his faith in you to believe
[48:28] that what he said will come to pass the
[48:32] purge me in church age this was a living
[48:34] faith I live by the faith of the Son of
[48:37] God Paul did not say that he lived by
[48:39] faith in the Son of God it was the faith
[48:42] of the Son of God that had given him
[48:44] life and kept him living in Christian
[48:47] victory
[48:49] your faith is awfully limited friends
[48:51] your faith is an awfully limited product
[48:53] but when you get into the faith of the
[48:55] Son of God and that is beginning to
[48:57] operate through you
[48:59] oh something's gonna happen living in
[49:03] Christian victory
[49:05] now
[49:06] faith is a revelation from God
[49:10] faith is a Revelations that's where I
[49:13] want to stay there just a minute it's a
[49:15] revelation he has revealed it to you by
[49:19] a lot of your effort
[49:21] by being just so righteous that God
[49:24] Finally Revealed the word to you and
[49:26] gave you Faith No
[49:29] he has revealed it to you by his grace
[49:34] it's nothing you did you didn't work
[49:37] yourself up into Faith you ever have
[49:40] faith it's give to you by the grace of
[49:43] God and God reveals it to you therefore
[49:46] faith is a revelation and the whole
[49:48] Church of God is built upon the
[49:51] revelation
[49:52] one place brother Ram says faith is a
[49:54] revelation of the will of God and so we
[49:57] could go into to Hebrews the 11th
[49:59] chapter and we could look at how by
[50:01] faith a revelation of the will of God
[50:03] Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[50:06] sacrifice we can look about how Enoch by
[50:09] a revelation of the will of God by faith
[50:11] he was pleasing before God he walked
[50:13] before God when God begins to reveal it
[50:16] to you you have a confidence you have an
[50:18] assurance when he begins to place that
[50:20] in your heart and everything else can be
[50:22] contrary
[50:24] but that Faith goes beyond the reasoning
[50:27] it goes beyond common sense it goes
[50:29] beyond logic I remember some years ago I
[50:32] had an experience where I was praying
[50:34] for somebody that was just really under
[50:36] a spirit of reasoning and they were just
[50:37] going in their mind and they were just
[50:39] being attacked just constantly and and
[50:41] they were just all tore up and they
[50:43] didn't know whether you know the Bible
[50:45] was true or God was real or or if the
[50:47] message had any validity they just
[50:48] didn't know what to think their mind was
[50:51] just in this turmoil and and I remember
[50:53] I went down to the church and opened it
[50:55] up one night and I was just in prayer
[50:57] praying for that person and and I just
[51:00] felt a real burden of intercession and I
[51:02] highly cautioned you to ever do this
[51:04] but I said God I'm standing between that
[51:07] darkness and my friend
[51:10] and I knew what that meant
[51:13] and for days I just went into a world of
[51:17] darkness and chaos
[51:19] that Darkness just coming against me and
[51:23] and
[51:24] I remember as I was in there I
[51:26] remembered a time when I used to think
[51:29] that you know
[51:30] believing in God is just the simplest
[51:32] thing there is knowing this message is
[51:33] true it's just as simple as one two
[51:35] three it's just so simple you look out
[51:37] here I mean only a fool would say
[51:39] there's no God you look at the universe
[51:41] the creation you know there's a God you
[51:43] look at religions there's nothing that
[51:46] touches Christianity
[51:48] you look at Christianity the message of
[51:50] the hour is the only thing that has the
[51:52] the reality of the word the purity of
[51:54] the word you look at it it's just it's
[51:56] just so simple you can just see there it
[51:57] is
[51:59] but when I went into that Darkness
[52:02] that logical reasoning didn't help me
[52:04] none
[52:05] and as those questions begin to come
[52:07] every which way I could I would try to
[52:10] out argue and I try to out argue it and
[52:12] there would be another answer there'd be
[52:13] another thing coming and you know it
[52:16] really helped that I knew what was
[52:17] happening and knew this wasn't me knew
[52:20] that I was in a battle and all these
[52:23] things began to come and after some few
[52:25] days I remember I was sitting there at
[52:27] work just working and and putting on
[52:29] some electrical connectors and
[52:31] I remember sitting there fighting this
[52:33] darkness and
[52:35] and then all of a sudden
[52:36] because it got to a place friends where
[52:38] I could not tell you with my mind that I
[52:41] knew this message was true I couldn't
[52:43] tell you with my mind that I knew God
[52:45] existed not with my mind I could not
[52:47] tell you with my mind that I knew that I
[52:50] existed
[52:52] you get into this fog of well well maybe
[52:54] I'm just dreaming that I exist maybe I'm
[52:56] just how what do you know is real what
[52:58] is reality there was absolutely nothing
[53:00] that wasn't that was something you could
[53:01] put your foot on and say this is truth
[53:04] this is truth in the mind it wasn't
[53:07] there
[53:08] but I remember as I was working there
[53:10] I just stood up and I said Satan I'll
[53:13] preach this message the rest of my life
[53:15] though I never again understand it in my
[53:17] heart my mind because I know in my soul
[53:20] that this is truth
[53:22] and you know that wasn't reasonable that
[53:24] wasn't logical and there was nothing he
[53:27] had that could come against Faith a
[53:29] revelation of the word of God but it
[53:31] gave me a Grace honestly for those
[53:33] people who have fallen because if that
[53:35] wasn't there I didn't put that there
[53:37] inside of me I didn't reveal this word
[53:39] to me but God revealed it to me and if
[53:41] it wasn't for that I would have had
[53:42] nothing to stand on but Upon This Rock
[53:45] the revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[53:47] upon that rock he will build his church
[53:49] and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[53:52] against it
[53:55] a little bit later my friend contacted
[53:57] me and they said you know I was just
[53:59] walking through the house and all of a
[54:01] sudden something inside of me spoke out
[54:03] of me and says I know
[54:07] I know God is real and I know this
[54:10] message is true they said what do you
[54:12] think that was
[54:13] I says that is the seed of God that lies
[54:16] within you that responded and came out
[54:18] through all that darkness and responded
[54:20] with faith in the word of God
[54:25] faith
[54:27] is a substance
[54:29] faith is a reality faith is something
[54:32] that's not logical it's not reasonable
[54:35] when everything else is contrary that
[54:37] faith will stand there and will not be
[54:41] shaken
[54:43] some time ago I I went out for uh went
[54:46] out for a little walk and
[54:49] and uh was up here in Cordis Junction
[54:51] and went out it was kind of a a getting
[54:54] dark a little bit and I went out there
[54:56] and suddenly it got real dark and I was
[54:58] like well I'll just use the moon and
[54:59] then the clouds came up and covered up
[55:01] the moon and so I'm really in the dark
[55:03] and I've got my phone and I pull it out
[55:05] and I've got like four percent left on
[55:06] the battery so that flashlight wasn't
[55:08] gonna work and I'm back there probably a
[55:09] couple miles out in the the rocks and
[55:12] the cactuses everywhere and so you start
[55:13] to learn this you know technique when
[55:15] you're walking in a situation like that
[55:16] so you just you're carefully walking
[55:18] through feeling your way through the
[55:19] dark trying to place your feet and as I
[55:22] was going through there I began to hear
[55:24] this this Creek flowing and I'm like
[55:26] that doesn't make sense like I thought I
[55:28] knew the geography a little bit better
[55:29] you know how's our Creek right here and
[55:32] I got a little bit closer and it was a
[55:35] high power transmission line that was
[55:37] running through there
[55:38] and the energy going through there was
[55:40] just crackling and popping just the the
[55:42] pulsation of energy flowing through
[55:44] there I think they're running close to
[55:46] 300 000 volts being pushed through those
[55:48] high power transmission lines incredible
[55:50] power running through there there was
[55:52] actually just Sparks of little you know
[55:54] energy just bursting off of there you
[55:55] can see the light flashing a little bit
[55:57] I was like man that's a lot of power
[56:00] but my phone's still dead
[56:04] you know here I am under an incredible
[56:08] amount of power is just a few feet away
[56:10] from me
[56:11] and I have a phone that needs a charge
[56:13] so I can turn on a light so I can find
[56:14] my way home
[56:16] and I could have sat there all night
[56:19] wishing for a charge
[56:21] and it wouldn't have happened
[56:23] I could have yelled at that charged my
[56:25] phone charge my phone
[56:28] nothing what happened
[56:31] there is a law to electricity
[56:34] there is a way you have to operate with
[56:36] it the power is there the power was
[56:39] there no questions asked there was
[56:41] enough power there to to light up the
[56:43] whole district for miles around
[56:46] and yet I sat in darkness
[56:48] because I had to go and find the proper
[56:52] channel for that power to flow through
[56:56] and
[56:57] you know I eventually I worked my way
[56:59] over to a little place and I got on a
[57:00] little Trail and and after a long time I
[57:03] finally got back to the house and I
[57:04] plugged a little charger into the wall
[57:06] and that connected to the wires inside
[57:09] the wall which went to the transfer
[57:10] station which went to the the
[57:12] electricity and it channeled it down and
[57:14] I finally got that charge on my phone
[57:15] but I was out of the woods but
[57:18] there is a law to electricity
[57:21] that it operates by I don't care how
[57:24] much you want it to do something if you
[57:26] don't follow the law of electricity
[57:28] it's not going to happen
[57:31] and the exact same thing applies to the
[57:35] power of God there is plenty of power
[57:38] there friends there is plenty of
[57:41] omnipotence that's just waiting to be
[57:42] tapped into it is there but there is a
[57:46] law of faith that it operates under now
[57:49] within you as a believer in God that as
[57:52] a child of God there is enough power in
[57:54] you to speak a world into existence and
[57:57] go live on it
[57:59] incidentally the devil can't create a
[58:01] grain of sand
[58:04] but there's enough power within you to
[58:06] speak a world into existence and go live
[58:07] on it now what keeps that from happening
[58:09] what keeps all the introverts from
[58:11] having their own private World well it's
[58:14] a law of faith that it has to operate
[58:16] through that channel of faith
[58:19] faith in what
[58:23] program says in the Hebrew series he
[58:25] says now the only way that a church can
[58:27] be built the only way that a man can
[58:29] have faith is not by his denomination
[58:31] not by his affiliation but his faith
[58:35] rests not upon the Theology of some
[58:37] man's ideas because it's more or less
[58:39] altogether man but the only way faith
[58:42] can find its solemn resting place is
[58:45] upon the immovable and unchangeable word
[58:48] of God faith cometh by hearing hearing
[58:51] the word that's how it takes and and
[58:53] when faith is heard and accepted it's
[58:56] forever settled nothing can no more can
[59:00] ever move it no matter what comes or
[59:02] goes nothing can ever change that Faith
[59:06] think of it you're anchored and you know
[59:09] more change for Time and Eternity you're
[59:12] anchored forever
[59:15] now that's a powerful kind of face right
[59:18] there that's a revelation that will
[59:20] never leave you no matter what comes in
[59:21] your life and if you have not yet
[59:23] received that revelation of who you are
[59:25] in Christ Jesus if he has not revealed
[59:27] to you you are my child you are my bride
[59:31] then I ask you tonight to call upon him
[59:34] Lord reveal who I am reveal who I am
[59:37] because once it's revealed to you I
[59:39] don't care
[59:40] what you go through I don't care how
[59:42] hard it gets I don't care the challenges
[59:43] there will be an anchor there that says
[59:45] but I am a Son of God I am a believer I
[59:49] don't care what these obstacles are I
[59:50] don't care how opposite it might seem to
[59:52] my personal feelings and my experience
[59:54] right now I know by a divine revelation
[59:56] that I am a believer
[1:00:01] but faith has a law
[1:00:04] and brother Branham says that faith is
[1:00:06] just like common hyssop it's just a
[1:00:09] common weed they applied that token with
[1:00:11] faith with hyssop it's just common
[1:00:13] everyday faith
[1:00:15] it's just the same faith that you use to
[1:00:17] go out and put the key in your car and
[1:00:19] start it that's the same faith that
[1:00:21] brings the realities of God's word into
[1:00:23] action
[1:00:24] it's simple common everyday Faith it's
[1:00:28] not something worked up something some
[1:00:29] manufactured something it's just a
[1:00:32] complete confidence well I mean if I
[1:00:34] turn on the light the light's going to
[1:00:36] turn on you don't even think about it if
[1:00:39] God said it then that's what's going to
[1:00:41] happen like there's not this big long
[1:00:43] argument about it friends there's not
[1:00:45] this lengthy discussion did God speak it
[1:00:48] if that's what he said then that's
[1:00:51] what's going to be there's not this
[1:00:52] there's not this questioning this
[1:00:54] reasoning oh maybe it's not for me maybe
[1:00:56] it's for somebody else maybe Faith
[1:00:58] doesn't do that Faith isn't manufactured
[1:01:00] there's just something subconscious
[1:01:02] about it down on the inside
[1:01:04] it just receives it
[1:01:07] now
[1:01:08] you think like to take a step takes
[1:01:10] faith
[1:01:11] that took faith
[1:01:13] you might think well that's ridiculous
[1:01:15] that's crazy like if you want to take a
[1:01:16] step you just take a step yes but it's
[1:01:19] faith
[1:01:21] um I was in a situation one time where I
[1:01:24] didn't have faith to take a step I
[1:01:26] literally didn't and I couldn't
[1:01:28] I could not take that step it happened
[1:01:30] to be about a 20-foot Cliff going into a
[1:01:33] nice waterfall and and a big Lagoon
[1:01:35] there and and all my friends were
[1:01:37] jumping off the cliffs so of course
[1:01:38] naturally you have to too you know
[1:01:40] that's the rules and so so I was
[1:01:43] standing there and I'm like okay I'm
[1:01:45] gonna jump I'm gonna jump and I'd go up
[1:01:47] and and my feet just wouldn't cooperate
[1:01:49] with my mind was saying I was going to
[1:01:51] do
[1:01:51] and they'd stop and I'd jerk back and
[1:01:54] like no no it's gonna work I'm gonna do
[1:01:56] it I'm gonna do it and I I'd wind up
[1:01:58] again and I'd come and and I'd stop
[1:02:03] why couldn't I jump
[1:02:07] didn't have enough faith
[1:02:09] to take a step eventually I stood there
[1:02:12] long enough and finally I did get up
[1:02:14] enough Faith I'd seen everybody else do
[1:02:16] it I knew the water was deep enough I've
[1:02:18] done it in the past I knew I enjoyed
[1:02:19] doing it but finally I got up enough
[1:02:21] Faith to take
[1:02:23] a little six inch step
[1:02:26] and then I screamed all the way down and
[1:02:28] had a great time and did it again and
[1:02:30] again and again but you can't do the
[1:02:33] simple things of life without faith you
[1:02:35] don't even realize it's there
[1:02:36] but if it wasn't there you couldn't get
[1:02:38] out of this chair and walk out of the
[1:02:40] building tonight
[1:02:41] faith is subconscious
[1:02:44] now
[1:02:45] faith is just you know flipping that
[1:02:48] that uh switch
[1:02:50] when you flip that switch
[1:02:52] it turns on the power
[1:02:56] and it's faith that is that key faith
[1:02:59] that turns that that uh light on now
[1:03:03] let's see here so we've got these this
[1:03:06] nice little shop light with a halogen
[1:03:08] bulb if you're into construction you
[1:03:09] already know it might not work
[1:03:14] now
[1:03:17] we got this here so we got the cord
[1:03:21] so right now what we're operating under
[1:03:23] is the laws of electricity
[1:03:25] how many believe if I get the laws of
[1:03:27] electricity right this light's going to
[1:03:29] turn on
[1:03:31] why
[1:03:34] you ever seen it happen before
[1:03:38] you ever
[1:03:39] you ever operated under the laws of
[1:03:41] electricity and suddenly electricity
[1:03:42] failed to work
[1:03:45] no
[1:03:46] if you follow the laws of electricity
[1:03:49] it's going to work
[1:03:50] now
[1:03:51] if I sit here
[1:03:52] and say well here's the promise of God
[1:03:54] here's the word of God we're going to
[1:03:56] plug it into the to the source here
[1:03:58] we plug it in because he praise God you
[1:04:01] know the church is just really on Fire
[1:04:03] or the pastor preached a good message
[1:04:04] all these different things
[1:04:07] but if we never make this connection
[1:04:10] what's gonna happen
[1:04:12] nothing
[1:04:13] if we go ahead and make this connection
[1:04:16] all right so we've got a connection
[1:04:17] there we've got a connection here
[1:04:19] everything's been done according to the
[1:04:22] right law everything's been put in place
[1:04:24] but you got all of that power there's
[1:04:26] power there
[1:04:27] pretty sure power's there
[1:04:30] the chords are good the connections are
[1:04:32] right
[1:04:34] but you get down to this last little
[1:04:36] switch of faith
[1:04:38] all of that power is waiting for
[1:04:41] somebody with just enough Faith to watch
[1:04:44] up and flip the switch
[1:04:46] and it worked
[1:04:48] now you might have had a couple of
[1:04:50] questions about whether it might work or
[1:04:52] not the first time
[1:04:55] but what about now
[1:05:01] any child here
[1:05:03] can flip that switch and we'll get the
[1:05:05] exact same results that President would
[1:05:07] get
[1:05:09] it's a law
[1:05:11] power is there
[1:05:13] faith will release that power into an
[1:05:16] action every time I push the switch it
[1:05:19] gives me more assurance
[1:05:22] it's gonna work
[1:05:24] it's gonna work
[1:05:25] it's gonna work
[1:05:27] it's a law
[1:05:28] and every time I see that law go into
[1:05:31] effect I have more confidence
[1:05:34] that it'll do it next time if I tell
[1:05:36] somebody go over there flip that switch
[1:05:37] they say well is it going to work
[1:05:40] don't worry about it I just tested it
[1:05:41] yesterday I just tried it out yesterday
[1:05:43] it turned on the flip switch the power
[1:05:45] came and we had a connection now
[1:05:49] there's some very important things that
[1:05:51] come
[1:05:53] into making these laws work
[1:05:55] you know we could take this
[1:05:57] and we can say well you know I believe
[1:05:59] we've got everything set up I believe
[1:06:01] we've got this we've got this Faith but
[1:06:03] we're going to take this and we're going
[1:06:05] to plug it into you know to our pastor
[1:06:07] here and we plug it into the pasture
[1:06:09] well you know there might be power there
[1:06:11] but that's not the channel it's supposed
[1:06:13] to work by we come right here oh there's
[1:06:16] there's power right here there's power
[1:06:17] in the speaker I know it's there I can
[1:06:19] hear it right now you try and plug into
[1:06:21] this
[1:06:22] it's not going to work that is not the
[1:06:24] provided way
[1:06:26] for the power of God to flow
[1:06:29] you know when you need something from
[1:06:30] God
[1:06:32] you don't approach the pastor as a man
[1:06:36] you approach him
[1:06:37] as a channel for God to flow through to
[1:06:41] you because that man can do nothing for
[1:06:43] you
[1:06:44] there is no good thing in any man I
[1:06:47] can't help you
[1:06:48] brother wrong can't help you
[1:06:50] but there is a gift
[1:06:52] and that gift is to let the man get out
[1:06:56] of the way and let God come down
[1:06:59] now if you'll plug this into the right
[1:07:01] Source if you'll place your faith and
[1:07:03] your confidence in the word of God in
[1:07:05] the promise of God
[1:07:07] every single time
[1:07:10] it's going to produce the result
[1:07:12] now as an electrician sometimes I come
[1:07:14] into a problem and the power is not
[1:07:16] there the light's not turning on
[1:07:18] going to a place and the Outlet's not
[1:07:20] working you know one of the first things
[1:07:22] I do I walk over to the light switch and
[1:07:24] I flip the light switch
[1:07:26] because I want to find out is there
[1:07:28] power in the room
[1:07:29] is it there if it's not in there then I
[1:07:31] go out I go to the main breaker I check
[1:07:34] to see if the breakers are flipped is
[1:07:35] there a break in the connection
[1:07:36] somewhere because I know electricity
[1:07:39] works I know it will turn on the light
[1:07:41] if I can get it right and so I go out to
[1:07:44] the breaker box is there a break in the
[1:07:45] connection where is this happening I go
[1:07:47] to the main meter is the power turned
[1:07:49] off and what's going on I I have to find
[1:07:51] out is there maybe a power outage just
[1:07:53] APS you know do they just have a power
[1:07:54] outage their stations are down like
[1:07:56] what's going on because I know it will
[1:07:59] work
[1:08:01] and I know the word of God the power is
[1:08:05] there omnipotence is there waiting to be
[1:08:07] released I know it's there and I know if
[1:08:09] I can get that connection from all from
[1:08:11] there right through the promise of God
[1:08:13] right through the word of God get it to
[1:08:15] the person and see that Faith connect it
[1:08:18] will produce it is a law of God
[1:08:22] oh it's not a maybe so it's a reality
[1:08:26] and you know
[1:08:28] right now when this light turns on it
[1:08:31] gives me confidence the power's here
[1:08:34] if I needed to put a light over there I
[1:08:36] could plug it in over there if I needed
[1:08:38] a light over there I could plug it into
[1:08:39] there the power is there and it gives
[1:08:41] you such a confidence
[1:08:44] that if the light worked for them
[1:08:46] it'll work for me too
[1:08:48] if he can turn on the light if my little
[1:08:51] girl can push the button and turn on the
[1:08:53] light then if I need the light I'll just
[1:08:56] flip that switch
[1:08:57] I'll just push that button of faith in
[1:09:00] God's word and watch it come into a
[1:09:02] reality
[1:09:04] you know back some time ago my wife was
[1:09:07] bound in depression
[1:09:09] she was bound in in just a darkness of
[1:09:12] of Satan and and suicidal thoughts and
[1:09:15] just torment
[1:09:21] but one day
[1:09:24] one of the first things that happened
[1:09:26] is God spoke into her heart
[1:09:28] and said you are a believer
[1:09:33] and God began to lead her out of that
[1:09:36] Darkness
[1:09:37] and tonight she sits there free from
[1:09:40] that oppression of the enemy
[1:09:44] the god that delivered my wife from
[1:09:46] depression is the same God that came and
[1:09:49] delivered sister Tracy Lovell who was
[1:09:51] bound by depression Bound by all of this
[1:09:53] Darkness he came down and he delivered
[1:09:55] her and she just shared her testimony a
[1:09:57] couple weeks ago
[1:10:01] well let me ask you
[1:10:02] if God did it for them
[1:10:05] what about you
[1:10:08] back I was just looking at the dates
[1:10:10] actually and it the testimony of it came
[1:10:12] three years ago to this day back a few
[1:10:15] years ago if you have those pictures I
[1:10:17] was at my home and my little girl she
[1:10:20] says daddy you've got a thing on your
[1:10:22] head and I looked at I was like yeah I
[1:10:24] had this skin growth for about about six
[1:10:26] months that had been on my head there
[1:10:28] and it was just kind of ugly and scabby
[1:10:29] some kind of a growth I didn't really
[1:10:31] know what it was and she says well you
[1:10:33] need an appointment
[1:10:35] well she's like appointment and I was
[1:10:38] like yes and uh maybe Hit the Lights a
[1:10:42] little bit you might be able to see it
[1:10:42] better I know but uh she says you need
[1:10:45] to get an appointment Daddy and I was
[1:10:46] like it was Sunday morning I was like
[1:10:47] well you know I probably should I mean
[1:10:49] you know skin growths and Cancers and
[1:10:51] things are probably something you should
[1:10:51] goof around with I was like maybe I
[1:10:53] should get something and I wasn't really
[1:10:55] sure and then God just began to deal
[1:10:56] with me
[1:10:57] bring it to me
[1:11:00] and so I said Lord I'm gonna have an
[1:11:02] appointment with you this morning at
[1:11:05] church
[1:11:06] and so I went to church after service I
[1:11:10] went up I said brother Ted I want you to
[1:11:12] anoint me with oil and pray over me that
[1:11:16] this growth I don't know what growth
[1:11:17] this is I don't know what kind the lives
[1:11:19] it is
[1:11:20] but it's going to be gone
[1:11:22] he prayed for me
[1:11:23] and I went home and I told my little
[1:11:25] girl I says Jesus healed me
[1:11:27] she said really
[1:11:29] she said I said yeah and so she said
[1:11:32] well let me see and she looked at she
[1:11:33] says but Daddy it's still there
[1:11:37] I says but the thing that was inside of
[1:11:39] that is dead
[1:11:42] and so this was May 17th the next
[1:11:45] picture is May 18th it looked even worse
[1:11:49] the next day
[1:11:51] and then we got May uh 19th I believe
[1:11:56] next one there
[1:12:00] 22nd I think is next
[1:12:04] 23rd or 24th
[1:12:09] this is the picture
[1:12:11] from the next Sunday when I went back to
[1:12:13] church and shared the testimony that God
[1:12:15] had completely taken that away from me
[1:12:18] in seven days I watched that thing go
[1:12:21] from a dead growth to completely dying
[1:12:25] away and being replaced with brand new
[1:12:27] skin and I took my Bible and I went back
[1:12:30] to my little girl and I said you know I
[1:12:32] had an appointment and I want to read
[1:12:34] you the bill by his stripes I am healed
[1:12:38] it was paid in full
[1:12:42] that was three years ago today that that
[1:12:45] happened
[1:12:46] now the god that did that for me
[1:12:50] what about you
[1:12:54] the same God that healed brother little
[1:12:57] Isaiah Clayville who they said had
[1:12:59] tumors all up and down his spine had all
[1:13:01] of these these these health issues they
[1:13:03] came here to church prayed over him and
[1:13:06] God completely delivered that little boy
[1:13:09] you know that testimony it was new to me
[1:13:12] but I was rejoicing in it
[1:13:16] what did that my God
[1:13:19] if he did it for Isaiah
[1:13:22] what about you
[1:13:28] they were telling me the testimony of
[1:13:30] brother Neil Mater and how the doctors
[1:13:32] didn't understand how he could be alive
[1:13:34] and how he had never really seen a man
[1:13:36] go through what he did and that he was
[1:13:37] alive and the doctor told him he says
[1:13:39] every day that you're alive you're a
[1:13:42] miracle
[1:13:44] and his nickname at the hospital was
[1:13:46] Miracle Man
[1:13:47] that's what they said about him
[1:13:51] that was their testimony about what they
[1:13:53] seen in that man Satan cannot destroy
[1:13:56] you until God
[1:13:59] says I'm ready for him to come home
[1:14:01] little Josiah McGrady
[1:14:04] the doctors say he won't live he can't
[1:14:06] live but I seen with my own eyes him
[1:14:08] here at church on Sunday
[1:14:11] my God is Unlimited in his power
[1:14:15] Unlimited in his resource all that you
[1:14:18] need to do is operate by the law of
[1:14:20] faith and come over and flip that little
[1:14:23] switch and watch that law go into action
[1:14:27] it will produce
[1:14:30] and if you see it do it for one
[1:14:33] it tells you the power's there
[1:14:36] the power that of God that'll heal
[1:14:38] cancer the power of God that will raise
[1:14:40] the dead that will heal the blinded eyes
[1:14:42] that same God is here tonight
[1:14:47] and if he did it for them
[1:14:49] he'll do it for you all you got to do
[1:14:52] let's flip that switch of faith
[1:14:56] now
[1:14:58] when you recognize the hand of God
[1:15:00] moving when you recognize that God is
[1:15:03] present it raises your faith
[1:15:07] because you realize this is more than a
[1:15:10] story this is more than theology this is
[1:15:12] more than just religion we are serving a
[1:15:15] living God with living signs living
[1:15:18] works
[1:15:20] God has given us
[1:15:22] a message that we could have a perfect
[1:15:25] faith if you get the opportunity
[1:15:29] if you don't get the opportunity make
[1:15:30] the opportunity to go listen to the
[1:15:32] sermon perfect faith
[1:15:35] it is
[1:15:37] a treasure trove
[1:15:39] for the word of God is quick and
[1:15:42] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:15:44] sword piercing even to the dividing
[1:15:46] asunder of soul and of spirit and of the
[1:15:49] joints and of the marrow and is a
[1:15:50] discerner of the thoughts and intents in
[1:15:52] the heart the word made flesh Hallelujah
[1:15:56] the word operating in human flesh by
[1:15:59] physical signs by material Signs by
[1:16:02] scriptural signs perfectly to bring you
[1:16:05] a perfect faith for a perfect rapture
[1:16:10] God has given you a message that is a
[1:16:13] perfect word so that you can have a
[1:16:15] perfect faith if you didn't have
[1:16:16] confidence in the word how could you
[1:16:18] have perfect faith you couldn't do it
[1:16:20] but when you know that this is a
[1:16:22] Vindicated word when you know that you
[1:16:25] can hang your soul upon this message of
[1:16:27] the hour you can have a perfect faith in
[1:16:29] a perfect word and take a perfect
[1:16:32] rapture
[1:16:34] now
[1:16:36] if anybody here ever been skydiving
[1:16:39] one two
[1:16:41] three a few of you all right all right
[1:16:44] so
[1:16:45] you know I haven't been yet but I'd
[1:16:47] probably go if I got the right
[1:16:48] opportunity but if I went out to the
[1:16:51] skydiving facility you know and I I roll
[1:16:53] up there and they say hey yeah you ready
[1:16:55] to go here's your here's your parachute
[1:17:00] guess what
[1:17:02] I'm not going
[1:17:04] if the guy pulls out parachutes like
[1:17:06] okay yeah let me see the instructions so
[1:17:08] it says to clip okay I'm going to clip
[1:17:10] this here on you and oh man what was
[1:17:13] that other part let me see
[1:17:15] there's no way I'm jumping out of that
[1:17:17] plane
[1:17:19] with a parachute that looks like this
[1:17:21] and an instructor that really doesn't
[1:17:23] know what he's doing
[1:17:25] I'm not doing it I'm going to want to
[1:17:27] know beyond a shadow of a doubt I'm
[1:17:29] going to want to read the certificate
[1:17:30] that this parachute is actually one that
[1:17:33] works I'm going to want to find out that
[1:17:36] this instructor has done it again and
[1:17:38] again and again so that I can have
[1:17:40] confidence in what he's doing
[1:17:42] there's no way I'm trusting my life
[1:17:45] to something that hasn't been proven
[1:17:48] that means Vindicated
[1:17:50] this parachute right here that he gave
[1:17:52] me has not been Vindicated to work
[1:17:54] friends
[1:17:56] You're Gonna Fall Like a Rock
[1:18:03] now if you wouldn't jump out of a plane
[1:18:06] with a parachute that ain't Vindicated
[1:18:11] do you think God's gonna ask you
[1:18:13] to hang your soul upon a word that
[1:18:17] hasn't been Vindicated
[1:18:19] oh no
[1:18:21] he has given us a Vindicated message so
[1:18:25] that we can have an absolute confidence
[1:18:27] we can rest our soul I don't care how
[1:18:29] many certificates I might find on the
[1:18:31] wall of that parachute place I still
[1:18:33] might have a question but in my soul I
[1:18:35] have a revelation that has removed every
[1:18:37] question has removed every doubt I might
[1:18:40] not be able to explain it but I believe
[1:18:43] it because it has been proven it has
[1:18:46] been Vindicated
[1:18:49] who then will have the power of
[1:18:51] infallibility which is to be restored in
[1:18:54] this last age for this last age is going
[1:18:56] to go back to manifesting the pure word
[1:19:00] bride that means we will have the word
[1:19:03] again once again as it was perfectly
[1:19:05] given and perfectly understood in the
[1:19:08] days of Paul I will tell you who will
[1:19:10] have it it will be a prophet as
[1:19:13] thoroughly Vindicated or even more
[1:19:15] thoroughly Vindicated than any prophet
[1:19:17] in all the ages from Enoch to this day
[1:19:20] because this man will of necessity have
[1:19:23] the Capstone prophetic Ministry and God
[1:19:26] will show him forth he won't need to
[1:19:28] speak for himself God will speak for him
[1:19:30] by the voice of a sign
[1:19:33] we have a Vindicated prophet and that is
[1:19:37] so important because once you realize he
[1:19:40] is Vindicated you don't have to wonder
[1:19:42] whether or not what he's saying is
[1:19:43] inspired you don't have to wonder
[1:19:44] whether or not what he's saying is right
[1:19:46] or wrong if it's a Vindicated Prophet
[1:19:48] you can rest your soul upon the message
[1:19:51] of the hour because God has already
[1:19:53] stood behind it
[1:19:58] so
[1:20:01] to have perfect faith
[1:20:03] we need to have a perfect word
[1:20:06] and we have it friends
[1:20:08] we have received a message
[1:20:13] that has been Vindicated to be right by
[1:20:16] almighty God
[1:20:18] perfect Faith he says and so when a man
[1:20:20] lives by faith and walks by faith I mean
[1:20:23] substance faith
[1:20:25] he is isolated from the entire world and
[1:20:28] becomes a new creature in Christ there
[1:20:31] now you're getting into bride material
[1:20:33] see you're getting into rapturing
[1:20:36] condition now
[1:20:38] rapturing condition bride material you
[1:20:40] know what that means substance faith
[1:20:45] now when you get a revelation by faith
[1:20:48] in your personal identity that these
[1:20:51] things are speaking about you there we
[1:20:53] can go through the scriptures for for a
[1:20:56] lot longer than you all want to stay
[1:20:57] here showing all the different types all
[1:21:00] the different shadows showing how there
[1:21:02] would be a bride showing how there would
[1:21:03] be a people on this Earth who will
[1:21:05] manifest the word
[1:21:07] but you have to come to a place where
[1:21:10] you identify with it personally
[1:21:14] now
[1:21:16] I'm gonna kind of skip through this here
[1:21:18] a little bit but the RAM says now the
[1:21:20] only thing you have to do then is have
[1:21:23] faith in what you are have faith in what
[1:21:26] the word says you are
[1:21:32] I didn't say
[1:21:33] I'm the bride
[1:21:35] he did
[1:21:37] I didn't say well this is what I'm gonna
[1:21:40] do I didn't say well there's going to be
[1:21:42] Miracles following me I didn't say that
[1:21:44] he did
[1:21:46] I didn't say that these signs were going
[1:21:48] to follow me no
[1:21:50] he said these times will follow a
[1:21:52] Believer and that's just what I am
[1:21:56] you must have faith in what the word
[1:22:00] says you are
[1:22:05] the ram says the greatest curse
[1:22:08] oh I can't skip that back to that last
[1:22:11] quote and Jesus said what the word says
[1:22:13] you are and Jesus had faith in the word
[1:22:16] of God that said what he was it is
[1:22:19] written of me didn't David in the Psalms
[1:22:21] and the prophets and all of them speak
[1:22:22] of him I am the bread of life that came
[1:22:24] down from God out of Heaven amen and I
[1:22:27] am the Tree of Life from the Garden of
[1:22:28] Eden I in all these things I am that I
[1:22:31] am and he knew what that perfect faith
[1:22:34] that he was the anointed Messiah that
[1:22:37] the spirit of God was upon him he said
[1:22:39] now if in I myself I can do nothing but
[1:22:42] it's my faith in God and God was in him
[1:22:46] the word made manifest and when the word
[1:22:49] of God comes in you it's made manifest
[1:22:53] for you are a Believer and a Believer is
[1:22:57] the faith of God that moves in you
[1:23:03] oh Hallelujah
[1:23:06] what are you
[1:23:08] are you a hope so Christian
[1:23:11] are you a maybe so Christian or are you
[1:23:14] a believer
[1:23:15] what are you
[1:23:17] what does the word say you are
[1:23:20] you stand on that I don't care what
[1:23:22] obstacle might come I don't care what
[1:23:23] challenge might face you what does the
[1:23:26] word say you are Prophet said the
[1:23:28] greatest curse that's on the church
[1:23:31] today is not knowing what they are again
[1:23:35] he said if the church only knew its
[1:23:37] position it will one day
[1:23:39] friends I believe were in that day it
[1:23:42] will one day then the Rapture will go
[1:23:44] when it knows what it is
[1:23:48] you need to have a revelation of Who You
[1:23:52] Are
[1:23:53] I can't give it to you brother Ron can't
[1:23:55] give it to you but my Lord Jesus is the
[1:23:58] Divine revealer that will come down and
[1:24:00] will tell you you are my child
[1:24:06] oh and when that drops in
[1:24:09] it begins to do a work in your life
[1:24:10] there begins to become a reality to it
[1:24:13] you know there was a little Shepherd boy
[1:24:14] one time and he came up against the
[1:24:16] Goliath he came up against the Giant and
[1:24:18] they had questions like who do you think
[1:24:20] you are what do you think you're doing
[1:24:24] and
[1:24:26] and he began to tell them testimonies
[1:24:28] about how his God was real
[1:24:33] he said you know one day I was tending
[1:24:34] my father's sheep and and I could
[1:24:37] I could base it on something
[1:24:39] he could base it on something oh brother
[1:24:41] and the god that saved your soul can't
[1:24:44] he heal your body it's just the same
[1:24:47] reveal it to you he's your healer as he
[1:24:50] was your savior see but it's got to be
[1:24:53] revealed first that's the difference he
[1:24:56] David he had something to base his faith
[1:25:00] on said now this has never happened
[1:25:02] before but the same God that delivered
[1:25:06] me from the paws of the lion will
[1:25:07] deliver me from the uncircumcised
[1:25:09] Philistine well how do you know David I
[1:25:12] believe it why it's been revealed to me
[1:25:18] you know what he asked when he walked up
[1:25:20] and seen that situation
[1:25:21] he said who is that uncircumcised
[1:25:24] philistine
[1:25:26] what is his identity a man without a
[1:25:29] promise that cancer does not have a
[1:25:34] promise but you do who is that
[1:25:37] uncircumcised Philistine who is that
[1:25:39] giant that would defy the armies of the
[1:25:42] Living God
[1:25:44] David had a confidence he had a faith in
[1:25:47] his heart that God that delivered him
[1:25:49] from the paws of the lion and that
[1:25:51] delivered from the paws of the bear he
[1:25:53] was going to be the same God that was
[1:25:54] with him when he went up against that
[1:25:56] giant because he was under a covenant
[1:25:58] and that giant had no right he was
[1:26:00] nothing but a great big ten-foot Bluff
[1:26:07] he knew who he was
[1:26:10] he knew his position
[1:26:12] and he began to speak out a word of
[1:26:14] Prophecy that says you
[1:26:17] are coming down
[1:26:19] and all of this Army
[1:26:21] is going to be fed to the birds
[1:26:25] he knew
[1:26:27] you know what one man has been the
[1:26:30] presence of God and has seen the reality
[1:26:33] of God can strengthen an entire church
[1:26:36] more than 40 revivals
[1:26:39] to have that good cleansed member with a
[1:26:42] heart set of fire for God
[1:26:46] says in the Samaritan Church age
[1:26:49] you must have confidence in your
[1:26:50] identity he said in the Samaritan Church
[1:26:52] age there's who those these who are the
[1:26:55] Royal seed are the elect of God are the
[1:26:57] predestinated foreknown of God and were
[1:27:00] in the mind of God and His Thoughts in
[1:27:03] very plain language the true bride of
[1:27:06] Christ was in the mind of God
[1:27:09] eternally though not expressed until
[1:27:11] each came forth in the designated
[1:27:13] decreed season you are a manifested
[1:27:17] attribute a manifested thought of
[1:27:19] almighty God and you were placed
[1:27:21] directly here for a direct season for a
[1:27:24] direct time for this time
[1:27:27] don't wonder about your your position
[1:27:30] don't wonder about your identity how
[1:27:32] could it be me how could it God said I'm
[1:27:34] going to take that person and I'm going
[1:27:36] to put them right there and they are
[1:27:38] going to manifest my nature
[1:27:41] as each member came forth it had became
[1:27:45] expressed and it took its place in the
[1:27:48] body thus this bride is the literal
[1:27:51] spoken word seed bride and though she is
[1:27:54] feminine in designation she is also
[1:27:56] called the body of Christ it's very
[1:27:59] apparent that she ought to be called
[1:28:00] this that for she was predestinated in
[1:28:04] him came from the same Source was
[1:28:07] eternal with him and is now manifesting
[1:28:10] God in a many-membered body whereas once
[1:28:14] God was manifested in one member even
[1:28:16] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:19] so what are you
[1:28:21] God manifested in human flesh
[1:28:28] do you get stumbled by the swaddling
[1:28:30] close
[1:28:32] do you get stumbled by the
[1:28:33] Ridiculousness of
[1:28:36] being born in a manger
[1:28:38] over a manure pile somewhere
[1:28:42] it was still according to prophecy
[1:28:46] and you have been chosen placed in this
[1:28:49] hour as a spoken word seed bride
[1:28:52] to manifest God
[1:28:56] don't get hung up on the swaddling
[1:28:57] clothes you see in your own life friends
[1:29:00] for the random in the sermon Christ is
[1:29:03] the mystery of God revealed he says as
[1:29:05] Peter was walking with Jesus he says
[1:29:07] even he says Flesh and Blood did not
[1:29:09] reveal this to you he says even Jesus's
[1:29:11] own Earthly life did not reveal to Peter
[1:29:14] that he was the son of God he says but
[1:29:17] my Father which is in heaven has
[1:29:19] revealed this to you
[1:29:20] now don't you ever expect to wake up in
[1:29:23] the morning look in the mirror and be
[1:29:24] like yeah now that's a perfect Son of
[1:29:26] God
[1:29:28] flesh and blood's not going to reveal
[1:29:29] that to you friends but when God comes
[1:29:31] down and he begins to reveal to you when
[1:29:33] I said there will be a bride without
[1:29:35] spot and wrinkle I was talking about you
[1:29:38] when I said that there would be a people
[1:29:39] on this Earth who would be an invincible
[1:29:41] Army I was talking about you when God
[1:29:44] begins to come down and he begins to
[1:29:46] reveal to you that this is about you
[1:29:48] personally something's gonna happen to
[1:29:51] your faith
[1:29:54] oh Faith begins to go into action it
[1:29:57] begins to become a reality in your life
[1:29:59] when you understand that you're not just
[1:30:01] hoping about something you're actually
[1:30:03] in your position this is who you are
[1:30:05] you're not just trying to pretend
[1:30:06] pretend to be the Supreme Court Judge of
[1:30:08] the United States of America that's
[1:30:10] actually who you are you have this
[1:30:13] position you don't have to oh maybe if
[1:30:15] they'll let me into the Supreme Court
[1:30:16] today it's like no you're actually the
[1:30:18] Chief Justice of the Supreme Court like
[1:30:20] just relax that's who you are step into
[1:30:23] your position and make the Judgment call
[1:30:27] when you recognize your identity
[1:30:30] your Authority
[1:30:31] begins to come manifested
[1:30:36] oh friends we need to have a faith
[1:30:38] that'll break through that Amnesia and
[1:30:40] begin to declare to us who we are in
[1:30:43] Christ Jesus
[1:30:45] God is not speaking vaguely or generally
[1:30:48] about you know somewhere sometime there
[1:30:51] will be a bride no no it's not just a I
[1:30:55] hope some point there will be people
[1:30:57] come on the earth that will believe it's
[1:30:59] not like that friends there is a book
[1:31:01] with names written down on it there is a
[1:31:04] Lamb's Book of Life with specific names
[1:31:06] recorded and they are specifically
[1:31:08] recorded with specific attributes this
[1:31:11] is my bride
[1:31:13] the names of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:31:16] are recorded on that Lamb's Book of Life
[1:31:19] they are written there it's not a hope
[1:31:21] so it's not a maybe so
[1:31:23] it's a fact
[1:31:26] now when you can just begin to get that
[1:31:28] Revelation that same Revelation well
[1:31:31] you'll have a shout and fit like John
[1:31:32] had one time when he's seen his name
[1:31:34] written in that last book of life and he
[1:31:36] began to realize what that meant it
[1:31:38] meant that he was not going to hell it
[1:31:41] means that he was going to heaven it
[1:31:43] meant that if he hadn't eat of anything
[1:31:44] he had a right as a Son of God he had a
[1:31:47] right as a possessor of every Divine
[1:31:48] promise to whatever God said
[1:31:53] he knew he was redeemed he knew the
[1:31:55] blood was for him he knew that the blood
[1:31:57] worked he knew a whole lot when he
[1:31:59] realized that his name was recorded
[1:32:02] there
[1:32:04] and that's what this message of the hour
[1:32:06] does you get into this word and it'll
[1:32:08] begin to open up and you'll begin to see
[1:32:10] yourself identified in that word
[1:32:15] now notice what works as Faith expressed
[1:32:17] now notice we find here Isaiah spoken
[1:32:20] that a Virgin Mary as soon as the the
[1:32:23] grounds was already broke up she had
[1:32:25] been a virgin she hadn't run around the
[1:32:27] grounds had been already prepared or
[1:32:30] predestinated by foreknowledge of God
[1:32:31] even said she was a virgin right then
[1:32:35] God knowed what her name would be for
[1:32:38] her name was on The Book of Life in
[1:32:40] heaven God could have said behold a
[1:32:42] virgin named Mary shall conceive and
[1:32:44] bring forth a son and his name shall be
[1:32:46] called
[1:32:47] God knew exactly who he was talking
[1:32:49] about
[1:32:50] when he made that prophecy
[1:32:52] it wasn't a hoping someday maybe there
[1:32:55] would be someone come that was good
[1:32:56] enough
[1:32:57] no
[1:32:58] he knew her by name
[1:33:05] you know there was a time in the
[1:33:06] scriptures it's First Kings 13 when a
[1:33:08] prophet came and he cried out a prophecy
[1:33:10] against these these false priests that
[1:33:13] were offering incense to a false god and
[1:33:15] he cried out against it and he says
[1:33:17] there will be a son born to the House of
[1:33:19] David Josiah by name and he's going to
[1:33:22] tear down these altars he's going to
[1:33:24] desecrate them and do all these things
[1:33:27] 300 years later there was a child born
[1:33:30] by the name of Josiah who tore down
[1:33:32] those altars and desecrated those holy
[1:33:34] places of the paganism
[1:33:36] by name God said Josiah is going to come
[1:33:42] God could have put an appendix on the
[1:33:45] Book of Revelation that had every one of
[1:33:47] your names written down
[1:33:49] friends there is God is not questioning
[1:33:52] will somebody believe my message is
[1:33:55] somebody going to Manifest this word he
[1:33:57] knows
[1:33:59] he knows exactly who he was talking
[1:34:01] about when he said that there would be a
[1:34:03] bride on this Earth he knew exactly who
[1:34:05] he was talking about when he said there
[1:34:06] would be Overcomers in this laodicea he
[1:34:09] knows exactly who's going to do it
[1:34:15] it's not just a general thing friends
[1:34:16] it's personal and I can testify that I
[1:34:20] have found my identity in that word I
[1:34:23] have found where it was written of me
[1:34:25] behold I send Zachary Wallace Elijah the
[1:34:28] prophet that he might be receive this
[1:34:31] glorious message I have found myself
[1:34:33] personally identified in these
[1:34:35] scriptures and when that Faith begins to
[1:34:38] connect with that Divine promise
[1:34:40] all things are possible
[1:34:45] now in the same perfect Faith now when
[1:34:47] the same God comes to you and is pleased
[1:34:50] to dwell in you pleased to honor your
[1:34:53] word what your decision is what was
[1:34:56] Joshua's decision stand still son and it
[1:34:59] stood still
[1:35:00] amen sure what was Moses decision held
[1:35:03] to Stick Over the River like that and
[1:35:04] then called for it to open it and it
[1:35:06] opened and whatever you ask and if you
[1:35:09] say to this mountain who is that you
[1:35:13] if you say to this mountain who is that
[1:35:15] talking about
[1:35:17] so talking about somebody else in some
[1:35:19] other day some other age
[1:35:21] friends
[1:35:23] you've got to find your identity right
[1:35:25] here and if you say to this mountain be
[1:35:27] moved and don't doubt see in your heart
[1:35:30] but believe that what you said will come
[1:35:33] to pass then you can have what you said
[1:35:36] that puts you back in the word
[1:35:39] now that's not skim milk see
[1:35:42] it puts you back I know it's going to
[1:35:44] jump right over the top of you maybe see
[1:35:46] because it can't anchor but real genuine
[1:35:49] Faith catches that right now
[1:35:52] I don't know if I quite grasp it
[1:35:54] entirely but something inside of me
[1:35:56] there's a faith inside of me that says I
[1:35:58] believe that
[1:36:01] to be honest
[1:36:02] I've seen that
[1:36:06] I've seen my God
[1:36:09] back up his word
[1:36:12] but remember says that Satan tried to
[1:36:13] tempt Jesus
[1:36:15] Jesus didn't use his great power to tie
[1:36:18] up Satan with some Supernatural you know
[1:36:21] rope no he faced him on the word
[1:36:24] says he's tried to tempt Jesus from
[1:36:26] faith in the father's word here's what
[1:36:28] he did he tried to show him his great
[1:36:30] big ecclesiastical organizations on the
[1:36:32] Earth but he couldn't tempt him come
[1:36:34] over and join me I'll make you a bishop
[1:36:36] over all them Jesus said it is written
[1:36:38] yes sir Satan couldn't tempt him no sir
[1:36:41] he is past that but Jesus was the word
[1:36:45] his faith in the knowledge of himself
[1:36:48] that he was the word
[1:36:52] the faith in the knowledge of himself
[1:36:55] that he was the word the faith and the
[1:36:58] knowledge that this bride will not fail
[1:37:06] oh
[1:37:08] now I believe that there is a perfect
[1:37:10] faith that has been given restored back
[1:37:13] to the church in this hour and I believe
[1:37:16] that many times we actually operate in
[1:37:19] that realm of perfect faith
[1:37:21] for a season
[1:37:25] you know
[1:37:26] Peter couldn't walk on the water with
[1:37:29] intellectual faith
[1:37:32] that wouldn't have worked Peter couldn't
[1:37:34] have walked on the water with a hope so
[1:37:35] or maybe so Peter had genuine perfect
[1:37:40] faith
[1:37:42] Peter was doing all right until he got
[1:37:43] scared
[1:37:44] the word told him he could walk on the
[1:37:48] water
[1:37:50] he was scared first he thought it was a
[1:37:52] ghost He said Lord if it's you bit me to
[1:37:53] come to you on the water he said come on
[1:37:55] now that's just the same as James 5 14
[1:37:58] same as Mark 16 the same God said it
[1:38:01] come on and he started walking he done
[1:38:04] all right got down out of the ship
[1:38:06] started walking on there was a storm on
[1:38:08] the sea you know Great White Cap ways
[1:38:11] bigger than these Hills
[1:38:14] drop down a little bit Jesus said come
[1:38:17] on
[1:38:18] he stepped down he said it's the Lord
[1:38:21] I'll just walk
[1:38:25] it's the Lord I'll just walk
[1:38:28] but when he got his eyes on the waves he
[1:38:31] got scared
[1:38:33] what come in his mind first thing well
[1:38:35] I'm going to walk because the word said
[1:38:37] for me to walk
[1:38:39] and the next thing he looked at well he
[1:38:42] looked at his symptoms he looked out
[1:38:44] here and seen how big them waves was and
[1:38:46] he got scared and he and when he
[1:38:49] believed he did
[1:38:52] down he went see what he feared happened
[1:38:54] what he believed happened when he
[1:38:56] believed he could walk he walked when he
[1:38:58] believed
[1:38:59] got scared in his belief then his
[1:39:02] substance left him see he still
[1:39:05] professed his faith but he didn't have
[1:39:07] the substance the substance would have
[1:39:10] went right over the top of them white
[1:39:11] caps and went right on to him see if he
[1:39:15] has the perfect Faith see but he didn't
[1:39:18] have it he thought it did he did at
[1:39:21] first he was willing to venture right
[1:39:23] out
[1:39:26] well the why the Lord told me to do it
[1:39:28] it's got to happen
[1:39:31] he did it first friends
[1:39:33] he walked on the water at first
[1:39:37] he did it he had that faith and then he
[1:39:39] gets out there in the midst of a miracle
[1:39:44] and he begins to wonder
[1:39:46] but
[1:39:47] this isn't logical
[1:39:48] this isn't reasonable the doctor said
[1:39:52] yeah in all my life I've never actually
[1:39:55] seen this work
[1:39:56] this is not you know all of my
[1:39:59] associates nobody's going to believe
[1:40:00] that this is possible they don't even
[1:40:02] believe they're not going to believe my
[1:40:03] testimony
[1:40:06] you started to look around at symptoms
[1:40:07] circumstances these other things in the
[1:40:10] middle
[1:40:11] of a supernatural event he was already
[1:40:14] walking on the water France
[1:40:16] he was doing it
[1:40:19] he was in the middle of a miracle
[1:40:22] and then
[1:40:24] he started wondering
[1:40:26] what about this what about that
[1:40:29] you know what happened
[1:40:31] he went down
[1:40:34] but remember says now when you get to
[1:40:35] thinking well now wait and I've been
[1:40:38] sick so long stop you just might as well
[1:40:40] get back in the boat see but when you
[1:40:43] quit thinking about that Abraham
[1:40:47] considered not his own body now dead
[1:40:48] neither the deadness of Sarah's womb he
[1:40:51] didn't think about that he didn't even
[1:40:53] consider it wasn't even a thought into
[1:40:55] understanding
[1:40:57] he didn't even consider at all he just
[1:41:00] considered what God Said and he went on
[1:41:03] as long as Peter did that he walked
[1:41:07] to musicians would come
[1:41:10] I believe that many times in our lives
[1:41:13] God comes down he comes down into
[1:41:16] service he comes down when we're riding
[1:41:18] in a car somewhere
[1:41:20] I remember
[1:41:22] was at a meeting it wasn't a meeting it
[1:41:23] was just a group of young people in a
[1:41:25] house and God came down one of the most
[1:41:26] Supernatural ways I've ever seen
[1:41:28] had a five-hour prayer service with
[1:41:31] Miracle after miracle
[1:41:33] it was awesome amen and I was so busy
[1:41:36] praying for people that whole night that
[1:41:38] I never asked for anything myself
[1:41:42] I was about 19 I think back then and I
[1:41:45] remember thinking I was driving here by
[1:41:48] the Carefree Highway
[1:41:49] driving up Prescott on I-17 there
[1:41:52] and I was like
[1:41:53] I never asked for anything
[1:41:56] like
[1:41:57] why didn't I because in that atmosphere
[1:41:59] of perfect Faith you could have had
[1:42:02] anything you wanted
[1:42:04] in that atmosphere anything was possible
[1:42:08] and I was just like oh God I should have
[1:42:10] asked for something I was like what
[1:42:11] would I have asked for and I thought
[1:42:12] well you know I had that snowboarding
[1:42:13] injury and injured my shoulder real bad
[1:42:16] and couldn't raise it up very much and I
[1:42:18] was like I would have asked for my
[1:42:19] shoulder and I could have been healed
[1:42:20] like why didn't I
[1:42:23] driving up the road there
[1:42:26] the presence of the Lord came into the
[1:42:28] car
[1:42:29] he said I
[1:42:30] [Music]
[1:42:31] the same
[1:42:34] group and my faith went into action and
[1:42:37] I says then I claim my healing in the
[1:42:39] name of Jesus Christ
[1:42:42] I didn't notice it the first week I
[1:42:44] didn't notice it the second week but I
[1:42:45] kept testifying everywhere I went not
[1:42:47] because I was trying to have faith I was
[1:42:49] just so happy to share with everybody
[1:42:51] what God had did for me
[1:42:53] at one time I was testifying about it
[1:42:55] and I realized you know what that
[1:42:56] shoulder hadn't bothered me in a long
[1:42:58] time
[1:42:59] [Music]
[1:43:01] you know we look back at how God moved
[1:43:03] here he moved there he can meet you in
[1:43:05] your car he can meet you on the way to
[1:43:08] work he can meet you sitting in church
[1:43:10] tonight
[1:43:12] and God will come down and you'll begin
[1:43:15] to minister to you he'll begin to speak
[1:43:17] to you he'll begin to talk to you about
[1:43:18] something he'll begin to reveal a faith
[1:43:20] in your heart you might come up for
[1:43:22] prayer you might just be somewhere God
[1:43:24] speak something into your heart
[1:43:26] and you actually step out of the boat
[1:43:29] and you say well if that's what the word
[1:43:32] of God says then I'm going to stand on
[1:43:34] it and you begin to walk on the water
[1:43:37] but then the next day goes by or the end
[1:43:41] of the service and you're out in the
[1:43:42] parking lot and all of a sudden the
[1:43:44] questions start coming the storm cart's
[1:43:46] getting bad you see the waves rolling
[1:43:48] this way and that
[1:43:49] and you're starting to wonder
[1:43:51] well maybe I was just excited maybe I
[1:43:55] was just
[1:43:56] you begin to wander
[1:43:59] and you're already walking on the water
[1:44:01] friends you're already in the midst of a
[1:44:04] supernatural event keep your eyes on
[1:44:07] Christ Jesus when Peter turned his eyes
[1:44:09] and began looking at the situation he
[1:44:11] began looking at the circumstances he
[1:44:13] lost the miracle that was happening
[1:44:15] right then but if you can keep your eyes
[1:44:16] on Christ Jesus if he reveals something
[1:44:19] to your heart don't you hesitate don't
[1:44:21] you look to the right hand don't you
[1:44:22] look to the left keep your eyes centered
[1:44:24] on Christ Jesus and you watch that
[1:44:26] Miracle continue to manifest into a
[1:44:29] complete reality
[1:44:32] stand to our feet tonight
[1:44:35] [Music]
[1:44:38] I believe that
[1:44:39] [Music]
[1:44:41] God's done many different things in our
[1:44:44] lives and
[1:44:45] different times we could look at
[1:44:49] but then maybe the storm gets a little
[1:44:51] rough friends
[1:44:53] maybe we were standing on a promise of
[1:44:55] God but right now it just doesn't look
[1:44:56] possible
[1:45:00] but Christ look on what his word says
[1:45:03] look on what his promise is not on the
[1:45:06] situation not on the circumstance you
[1:45:09] stand and you look on him and you will
[1:45:11] continue walking in that Supernatural
[1:45:14] event all the way into the arms of
[1:45:17] Christ Jesus
[1:45:21] let's just bow our heads tonight
[1:45:25] if you have a need tonight something the
[1:45:27] Lord's just been trying to prick in your
[1:45:30] heart and say won't you just believe my
[1:45:31] promise
[1:45:33] won't you just believe what I said that
[1:45:36] your family would be saved won't you
[1:45:39] just believe my word when I said that
[1:45:41] I'm the god that healeth all of your
[1:45:43] diseases I'm the one that's here to
[1:45:45] provide for you if God's been pricking
[1:45:47] your hearts and just believe my promise
[1:45:50] I'm asking you tonight to flip that
[1:45:53] switch Prince
[1:45:54] I'm asking you just to reach over and
[1:45:56] say God I believe your word if you said
[1:45:59] for me to come then I'm coming I'm
[1:46:02] centering my heart on you I'm centering
[1:46:04] my focus on you I'm centering everything
[1:46:06] I am on your word on your promise I
[1:46:09] believe what you have spoken
[1:46:12] Heavenly Father you see the hearts here
[1:46:15] you see the hands that are lifted up
[1:46:16] Lord
[1:46:17] I can't give them anything because I
[1:46:20] don't have the power in myself but I
[1:46:22] serve a God who is Unlimited in his
[1:46:24] resources and the power is here tonight
[1:46:26] we know that the supernatural God is
[1:46:28] here present to keep his word to his
[1:46:31] children and I'm asking tonight that as
[1:46:33] we believe your word you would just drop
[1:46:35] down a revelation and confirm in the
[1:46:38] hearts of your children that you're
[1:46:39] doing exactly what you said you would do
[1:46:43] and every doubt every question those
[1:46:46] things that would come up in our minds
[1:46:47] Lord God I'm asking that they would just
[1:46:49] be driven back by a faith in the word of
[1:46:52] God that they have received
[1:46:54] [Music]
[1:46:57] Lord we're believers
[1:47:00] that is Who We Are
[1:47:02] we don't have to manufacture anything we
[1:47:04] don't have to produce anything
[1:47:07] they just follow the believer
[1:47:11] and I believe tonight there are
[1:47:12] believing Hearts here that are standing
[1:47:14] on your word
[1:47:16] and we're just going to be looking to
[1:47:18] hear the testimony
[1:47:20] of what you have done
[1:47:22] to your word
[1:47:24] bless each one here Lord
[1:47:27] may we continue to walk in a perfect
[1:47:30] faith in this perfect word for a perfect
