Brother Amos, would you come tonight and just take us to the Lord in prayer? We've got two prayer requests tonight. Please remember sister Debbie Asel. She was admitted to the hospital today with a severe infection in her foot. Please pray for God's healing touch. She asked for no visitors at this time. So let's remember sister Debbie Asel. Pray the Lord would come and be with her while she's there in the hospital. Brother Paul Maples got a request for a good friend of his has a brain tumor will have an operation on January the 2nd and has asked for prayer. So let's pray for this friend of brother Paul's. And if you have a need tonight, just want to lift that before the Lord. Brother Amos, if you would come. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He's able. &gt;&gt; Yes. Let's just bow our heads. Dear heavenly father, Lord, we just come humbly before your throne, Father, tonight, realizing, Lord, that there's no good in us lest you put it there. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we can come humbly, but we were told to come boldly. &gt;&gt; So, it's more of a respect, a humility, respect. Father, But it's a boldness in knowing that you can do all things and you have already provided. &gt;&gt; And I pray that you would just visit us once again, Lord, like you've done many in times past. Just like you came down in the form of Melzdc and visited Abraham, you've once again come down in our day, Lord, and visited us. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; You've given us a message, Father. &gt;&gt; To the world. It's judgment. To us, it's freedom. &gt;&gt; Freedom from our own desires. Fremer from our own wants and needs. Lord, [snorts] Lord, you said if we would just believe &gt;&gt; that all things are possible &gt;&gt; and that Calvary was a finished work. And there was some needs that weren't even pinned down tonight. There were some needs that are here amongst us that we are unspoken, Father. But Lord, you know all things &gt;&gt; and you have already provided &gt;&gt; and we thank you for that. We pray that you'd be with us throughout this evening. We're here, Lord, to dedicate our lives one more time, Father, to stand here at attention saying, Lord, teach us. Show us thy ways. We [snorts] want to follow you just like the Israelites followed the cloud by night and the pillar of fire by day. We want to follow you now, Lord. We thank you, Lord, that you've given us a message, Father. And the message is that you are in us. And we thank you for that. Thank you for Calvary. Thank you for the finished work. We pray that you would be with these needs, Father. The the ones that were pinned down, Lord, friends, associates, Sister Debbie at home with her foot that's Lord, it's been her Goliath that's been bothering her whole life, Lord. But you are more than able and your grace is sufficient. &gt;&gt; I pray that you'd raise her faith. Father, &gt;&gt; lift her up, Father. &gt;&gt; I pray that you'd be with those who couldn't be here. Be with those who are streaming, friends, family that are away, Father. Protect them. Give us life with purpose. We love you. We ask you these things. We pray that you would be with us through the service tonight. Be with us in the song specials, the testimonies. receive our praise, Lord. We love you. We ask these things in your name, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's may be seated. It's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. We want to welcome each one here to our watch night service.

If you're here visiting, we welcome you as well. Amen. come to the close of another year and so looking back at a lot of things that have happened this year in my life and we can say that God's been good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Want to take the time to count my blessings and be sure to give him all the praise and all the honor for everything that he's done. So thought we could sing the song tonight. Count your blessings. Name them one by one. Amen. How many can say that God's bestowed many blessings upon you? Amen.

When the host of Israel led by [singing] God around the walls of Jericho softly trod, oh trusting in the Lord, they felt the conqueror spread. [singing] By faith [music] they saw the victory ahead. Oh, victory [music] ahead. Oh, victory ahead through the blood of Jesus. Victory ahead. Oh, trusting in the Lord. I hear the conqueror [singing] strength. By faith, I see the victory ahead. And David with a shepherd's sleigh and five stones [music] met the giant [singing] on the field all the trusting in the Lord. He knew what God had [music and singing] said.

Trusting in [music and singing] the Lord. He did not fear our dread. By faith he saw the victory [singing and music] ahead. Oh victory ahead. Oh victory ahead. Through the blood of Jesus. Victory ahead. Trusting in [music] the Lord I hear the conquered bread. By faith I see the victory [music] ahead. [singing] Oh victory ahead. Oh, victory ahead through the blood of Jesus. [music] Victory ahead. [singing] Trusting in the Lord, I hear the conqueror [music] tread. By faith, I see the victory ahead. Hallelujah. So glad we have victory just ahead. He's paid the price. Amen. As we do every watch night service, we have another song special. So, we're going to have the Dubsky grandchildren if they would come and get ready to sing. While they're coming at this time, let's sing, "Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been good to me." We'll have the children come get ready to sing. And then after they sing, we'll have Miller come. He has a song for us as well. So, have the Dubsky grandchildren come while we're singing this. Lord, Lord, Lord, surely been good to me. Amen. Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been good to me. Oh Lord, [music] Lord, Lord, you've surely been good to me. Oh Lord, [singing] Lord, Lord, you've surely been good to [music] me. You have done what this world could save my soul.

And with my friends, Lord, [singing] my family, too. &gt;&gt; Oh, let me show [singing and music] everyone that I'm just like you. I want to [singing and music] be &gt;&gt; more like Jesus. [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; I want to be [music] &gt;&gt; more and more like him. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. More and more like [applause] &gt;&gt; [crying] &gt;&gt; Is Miller here? There he is. God bless you. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; God bless you, church. Um, so this song is in the key of D. Uh, I was hoping to get the help of the musicians, the other musicians. Um, um, I know in 2025, um, there's been a lot of hills and valleys that have gone through. Um, and in 2026, I'm sure there's going to be more um, hills and valleys, but we know that he's the God of the hills and valleys. &gt;&gt; I hope this song is a blessing, too. I've walked among the shadows. You wipe my tears away. I felt the pain of heartbreak. [music] I've seen the brighter days. I've prayed prayers to [singing] heaven. From my lowest place, I held [singing] your blessings. God, you give and take away. No matter what I have, your grace is [singing] enough. No matter where I am, I'm standing in [singing] your love. On the mountains, I will b my life to the one who set me [singing] there. In the valley, I will lift my [music] eyes to the one who sees me there. When I'm standing on the mountain, [singing] I didn't get there on my own. When I'm walking through the valley, I know I am not alone. You're the God of the [music and singing] hills and valleys. God of [singing] the hills and valleys and I am not alone. Father, give [singing] and [music] take away every joy and every pain. Through it all, you [singing] will remain [music] over it all. On the mountains, [singing] I will bow my life. In the valley, I will lift my eyes. On the mountains, [singing] I will bow my [music] life to the one who sent me there. In the valley, [singing] I will lift [music] my eyes to the one who sees me there. When I'm standing on the [singing] mountain, I didn't get there [music] on my own. But I'm standing through the valley. [singing] I know I am not [music] alone in the garden of hills [singing] and valleys. Hills and valleys [music] got his and [singing] valleys. And I am not [music] alone. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Miller. Thank you to the Dubsky girl grandchildren. enjoyed that song special. Brother Mario, if you would come at this time, we have several of the brothers speak to us this evening and brother Mario come and appreciate brother Mario and the Lord uses your ministry here at the church. Brother Mario, we pray the Lord continue to bless you in this coming year. So there microphone there. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. So we will go directly to the word of God because of our time and uh requesting you to stand with. So before we go to the Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. So we'll go to Psalms uh 77 verse 11-12. Praise the Lord. In Psalm 77 verse 11-12 I say I will remember the works of the Lord. Surely I will remember thy wonders of old and I will meditate also of all thy works and talk of thy doings and may the Lord of the blessings upon the reading of his word let us bow our head gracious heavenly father we just praise you Lord thank you Lord for your faithfulness thank you for your grace and your mercy and your love lord thank you for your sustaining power your strength Lord God that we gather together Lord at the end of this 2025 Lord Thank you once again. Be with us Lord as we remember your works and your word Lord in our midst tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. So you may be seated. So I will title this little thought remembering the the Lord. And he said that I will remember the works of the Lord and surely I will remember thy wonders. And as we close uh 2025 and step into 2026, we give all the glory of God for his goodness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we remember his good works unto us. As the prophet said, what is the works of God? And the works of God is that you will receive the one whom he sent. &gt;&gt; And we believe these last days, we are so grateful that we recognize, praise God, the one who he sent in these last days. Amen. Although the prophet already gone on the scene but we know as the prophet said the prophet for today is the holy ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are so thankful that uh the message came in our generations open to us the mystery of what was in the back part of his mind in this last days and we always remember how good God is in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't really knows about our life. Praise God. When we are born we are born in sin come to the word speaking lies. We don't know about God. Maybe some of you knows we are born in maybe a message church or something. But for myself, I was born uh we don't know God. We don't we don't read the Bible. But praise God when the message came, praise God into my life, I recognize, praise God, who I am, &gt;&gt; what God done for me. And I'm so grateful and always keep on remembering the Lord Jesus Christ. And it is really so so so blessed to remember what he has done for us. &gt;&gt; Not only what he has done but what he is doing right now. Amen. Continue to do. Amen. In the future. And we are so thankful. The more we remember what he has done in our lives, the more we have confidence in our life to continue to move on. Cuz he never fail us or never or never forsake us. But sometimes we are tempted to to think about our past failure. But remember as Paul said in Ephesians 3:13, he said, "Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do, forgetting those things, Amen. which are in the past, our hills and valleys, amen, which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before." Hallelujah. So we have the message of the hour that we are looking forward to and that is the changing of our bodies. So this message the changing of our body is not just a meat or a thought. It is the message of the hour which God vindicated in these last days. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As Paul said I press toward the mark &gt;&gt; for the price of high calling &gt;&gt; of God in Christ Jesus. Remember that there is a power that is released upon us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When we are able to disregard our failure and sin of the past and embrace the grace of God &gt;&gt; in our lives, &gt;&gt; we must always remember the grace of God in our lives. We must we have failure with so many things but the grace of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We must remember the goodness of God in our lives. &gt;&gt; Because it was his goodness that is running after us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever we go, his goodness is running after us. Amen. So we cannot really run away from his goodness and his grace and we need to remember everything. The more we remember the more praise God the uh the love of God is in our heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's not that we can just easily forget things but we must not allow our thought to retain those negative memories in the forefront of our mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because these are the things that are already in the sea of forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Once you say Lord I am sorry forgive me. It is already throw in the sea of forgetfulness and God don't remember it no more. &gt;&gt; So there is a power that will release us if we forget all those things which are in THE PAST AND LOOK FORWARD to the promises of God in these last days. So negative memories of the past failing can hold a person in a kind of mental prison house that will stunt their advancement of character of what God wants to advance them into. So there is an antidote of this problem of our of our remembrance of negative things of our past and that is to replace thought by purposely encouraging our mind to remember the things of the past of what the grace of God and the work that he has achieved in our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let us always remember not our past and failure but the grace of God that sustain our journey in this life. So remember in our opening scripture you said that I will remember the works of the Lord. Surely I will remember thy wonders. So it is our personal obligation to remember the works of God in our lives. not somebody's suggestions, not somebody's uh telling you to remember it, BUT IT MUST BE YOUR PERSONAL revelation of the grace of God in your life. &gt;&gt; And the s I will remember the works of God and meditate also of all thy works and talk of thy doings. So we need to focus on the thought of God's grace in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the psalmist here determined to meditate on the words and the works of God less he would forget. So we need to meditate upon the word of God. &gt;&gt; So we have tapes. So that's why we can press and play. &gt;&gt; As brother Brian Naidu said, press and play is not a doctrine. &gt;&gt; We can bless and play in our car, in our home or wherever we are. We can bless and play but not only in the church &gt;&gt; because we have pastor, we have ministers, we have live ministers, the five-fold ministry which can edify, praise God, the body OF JESUS CHRIST UNTIL WE come into the unity of the faith. &gt;&gt; But we need to meditate upon THE WORD OF GOD, PRESS and play. &gt;&gt; If you cannot press and play, read the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so the theme of remembrance runs throughout the entire Bible. Remember God said that rainbow in Noah after the flood. And that rainbow always signify his covenant his everlasting covenant that he will not praise God destroy the earth with a flood no longer. &gt;&gt; So it's always a kind reminder of God. So when I was I I told you before before I start know I I have no any Bible background don't know nothing about but what amazed me after the flood or after the rain I saw rainbow and I always amazed about that &gt;&gt; and I and I tried to find out maybe some discover what is the meaning of this color seven colors I don't know anything about it until I come to the message of the hour hallelujah and it reveals that is The covenant of God to Noah, an everlasting covenant, a covenant of peace. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So it is there to put remembrance of the grace of God is continuing on. &gt;&gt; The Sabbath was a weekly reminder of how God rested on the seventh day. And the Passover was a yearly event to remember how God delivered the Israelite from Egypt. Yes. &gt;&gt; And also in Joshua chapter 4, they stuck 12 stone in remembrance of how God miraculously parted Jordan River so they could cross over on Ragdump. &gt;&gt; And throughout the psalm, David and the other writer wrote their psalms and meditate on the works and wonders of God in order to keep them in remembrance &gt;&gt; of the grace of God. Even the last supper we will which we will do maybe tonight at the last supper Jesus instructed his followers to take the bread and the cup in remembrance of him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So remembering the Lord brings power into our lives. A keeping power and the supernatural power of deliverance and blessings. So remember we need to to remember the blessings of God. when we remember. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise God. The word of God, it brings power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT BRINGS POWER BECAUSE AS THE PROPHET SAID WHEN HE when he preached the message uh uh when he preached the message he said that the right mental attitude towards God's promise &gt;&gt; any divine promise &gt;&gt; when you believe it when you have the right mental attitude to remember the promise if you believe it &gt;&gt; then it will make &gt;&gt; or come into pass. Amen. Any divine promises put it in remembrance. Even the Psalms 103 said remember praise God the Lord and remember the benefits. &gt;&gt; What is your benefits? Your forgiveness of sin. &gt;&gt; It's already done deal. Hallelujah. Never forget your business. Always remember that God had already done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is already done. It is already finished in Calvary. Your sin was already finished. Praise God. Whatever trial you are in IS ALREADY DONE. GOD PROVIDED everything for whatever issues in our life. &gt;&gt; We just need to come before him by faith &gt;&gt; in the message in his presence. Brother Bernho quotes Psalm 16:18 and David said, "I have set the Lord before me." And that's a good thing to do. &gt;&gt; Psalm 16:8, "I've set the Lord before me." So he could not be confused about it. &gt;&gt; He wanted to be conscious &gt;&gt; of his presence. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So David said, "I have set the Lord always before my face." And now David have set the Lord before my face. Always to be conscious of God's presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the title of his sermon is in his presence. It is not just a title as the always brother Ron tell us every sermon's title is not just a title but it was a declaration. &gt;&gt; So in his presence as the prophet said we need to remember before our face so that we can be we can be conscious of his presence tonight &gt;&gt; and I believe his presence is here tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't need to see him. You don't need to feel him. that if you believe according to the word that wherever two or three are gathered IN THIS DAY, HE will be in our means. &gt;&gt; We need to be conscious of his presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember Sadra, Mesa, Abednego, there was a trial. There was a persecution that king Abopar declared that they will need to bow down to that image. &gt;&gt; But Sadra and Messabedo, praise God, speak the word. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; My God is able &gt;&gt; to deliver us &gt;&gt; from this fiery furnace. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, if he will not still we will not bow down. &gt;&gt; Remember he uttered the word. &gt;&gt; My God is able to deliver us. Yes. &gt;&gt; Then when they were thrown into the fire furnace, praise God, there was no even a smell of a smoke in their hair, in their dress or something like &gt;&gt; they walk. They never been touched BY THE FIRE WHATSOEVER because praise GOD THEY ARE CONSCIOUS &gt;&gt; OF THE PRESENCE OF GOD. THEY ALREADY UTTER THE WORD. My God is able to deliver them. Amen. AMEN. &gt;&gt; ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T SEE HIM, THEY DIDN'T FEEL HIM, BUT HE WAS THERE. &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS NEBUCHADNEZZAR WHO SAW THE PORTMEN. &gt;&gt; But three of them didn't really saw the portman. &gt;&gt; Do you are you conscious of his presence tonight? He don't need to show him physically. He don't need to let you feel &gt;&gt; sensations but he need to praise God to believe him according to his word. And we need to have the right mental attitudes toward his word. Be conscious OF HIS PRESENCE. WHATEVER YOUR PROBLEM TONIGHT, PRAISE be conscious of his promises. &gt;&gt; He will deliver you. Praise God. He will heal you. He will restore you. There is redemption in his presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why in his presence there will be &gt;&gt; joy. &gt;&gt; I always say this when I was in in a mission field. Don't look at me blankly because we come here to worship God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you are not satisfied with the preacher, ask God to touch the preacher. He become a mouthpiece so that he can speak unto you. Because we need to BE CONSCIOUS OF HIS PRESENCE because whenever two or three are gathering he said he will be in our midst. &gt;&gt; So we need to be conscious &gt;&gt; just like El Gi when they were surrounded by by the Syrian army he thought that they were only the people. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So Elijah said, "Lord, open the eyes of &gt;&gt; we are just in another dimension." &gt;&gt; And when God opened his eye, he saw, praise God, &gt;&gt; thousands of angels surrounded it. &gt;&gt; Remember in Exodus 23:20, he said that I will send angel before you &gt;&gt; to protect you. &gt;&gt; Amen. to guide you. &gt;&gt; Do you believe the angel is here tonight? &gt;&gt; Because his word never fail. He is the same. Praise God. Yesterday, today and forever. And we just need to be conscious of his presence. So that's why when you see and SAY IT'S THE ANGEL OVER HERE, &gt;&gt; you need to rejoice with it with us. So that's why when angel saw that you have no reactions to the word of God, the angel would thought maybe this is one of us because the angel don't know how to appreciate redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't react to to they don't experience being saved. They don't experience to be redeemed. &gt;&gt; They just sit there because they were worshippers. Amen. That was the only thing that they know. They don't know how to appreciate the word of God. BUT IF YOU ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD, maybe hallelujah, you need to be you need to be alive &gt;&gt; because the joy of the Lord is in you. &gt;&gt; That's why we said I'm SO GLAD WHEN THEY SAID UNTO ME, let us go into the house of the Lord. LET US GO INTO THE HOUSE NOT JUST A TRADITIONS TO GO every 30th, &gt;&gt; but we need to come to worship God in spirit and in truth. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when God SENT A PROPHET IN THIS LIFETIME and he revealed God unto each and every one of us, we become the true worshipper of God. &gt;&gt; Because God is not be called God unless there's somebody to worship him. And only the real believer which receive the message OF THE HOUR KNOW EXACTLY who God was &gt;&gt; and he could not be God unless there's a worshipper. Are you a worshipper tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we need to be thankful and be conscious of his presence &gt;&gt; every not only on the 31st of December &gt;&gt; but every day in our life we need to be conscious of that &gt;&gt; as the prophet said here as the prophet said he wanted to be conscious of his presence. So David said, "I have set the Lord always before my praise." Now I, David, have set the Lord before my face always to be conscious of God's presence. Wouldn't it be a good lesson for all of us tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Set the Lord before my face so we'll be conscious of his presence. Put him first. And why? &gt;&gt; Put him first before you. Why? Then you won't sin. When you are realizing that constantly you're in the presence of God when you realize God's around you watch and what you say. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD NEVER LEAVE US nor forsake us. &gt;&gt; Maybe sometime oh I am I I am in trouble. I am in prayer as if I I if I cannot feel the presence of God. &gt;&gt; We need to be conscious he's always here &gt;&gt; because he promised I will be with you even in you and two. That is not just a good quote. You need to experience him personally. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 73. A man when he thinks God's gone, he'll cuss. He'll lust after women. He steal, he cheat, he lie. Speaking about maybe this is unbeliever. But for believers, I don't think you can do that. He'll do anything when he think that God don't see him. but bring him into the presence of God. He'll stop it right now. &gt;&gt; And David said, "I have put the Lord always before me." That's a good thing. No wonder God said he was a man after his own heart. &gt;&gt; Man will do everything when he think that God isn't near. This is a wakeup call to those who feel that God is not here. I can do anything I want. &gt;&gt; But God is speaking to us tonight &gt;&gt; because this quotation didn't come for myself. It just by inspiration of God that I open it and God put it here tonight. &gt;&gt; Maybe he sent it to somebody else. Not outside but inside the church. Because remember there are three kinds of believer in the church. &gt;&gt; There are make believer there are believers and non-believers. But when he realized that God's near, did you ever notice a sinner, let a godly person walk up, he'll quit his cushioning. If he's got any respect at all, see, he won't tell the dirty jokes that he would told. He live off that because he knows that he's in the presence of God cuz God dwells in the tabernacle of his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I think each one of us maybe have experienced that when sometimes we we pass by unbelievers and they know they they they saw us and they just stop cussing. &gt;&gt; In my place there are so-called uh even so-called message believers. So when I enter their house immediately they they they panic. They put off the television or what show ever that they're doing and say, "Oh, brother, God bless you, brother. It's okay. I didn't come here to inspect about what you're doing." Just continue what you're doing. I just come here to say hello. Hi. But I am not here to judge you what you're doing. It is by the grace of God that you need to have your own personal revelation, personal conviction. Amen. You need to have your personal remembering the works of God in your life. What did you do in your life? &gt;&gt; So we need to remember the Lord this 2026. Hallelujah. God in his grace places experience in our life so that we can remember the things of what he did for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything that happens in our life it needs we need to experience it. The fact that God has allowed us to receive the message that he has sent in this day is such a great glorious thing that he has bestowed upon us and we must never let ourselves forget it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us always embrace it. &gt;&gt; We need to be grateful for the things that we have done. Remember not everybody can receive what you were saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that. Amen. Because if you share this this message to to somebody that your friend or family or something, they will reject what you believe. &gt;&gt; But for each and every one of us, we cannot deny it. We cannot reject it. We just believe it. If we don't REALLY UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES, BUT WE JUST BELIEVE it &gt;&gt; because God don't require us to explain what we believe. We just God look at faith &gt;&gt; in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the fulfillment of his great promises in his word and his faithfulness in sending the minister of Malachi 4 in our day. We know that we are actually a part of this great fulfillment. We are part of this prophecy being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 is not only for brother Brham. Malachi 4 is also for us &gt;&gt; because he said Elijah to you. &gt;&gt; So you find your scripture. Praise God. and anoint the scripture so that you can manifest the scripture in your day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the Deuteronomy chapter 6, this is the prophet reminding the people. He said, "And this word which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart." Remember the message that we receive is not to be intellectual knowledge of the word. It must be in our heart. &gt;&gt; It must be a part of our life. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he said, "I am the way." There's no other way that you can have salvation. There's no other way that you can know the truth. There's the only way is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the only way that you can know the &gt;&gt; And when the truth comes, he will set you free. Set you free from unbelief. Set you free from s uh uh set you free from your unbeliefs and traditions. And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children. This is the command of Moses. And shall talk to them when thou sitest in thine house. And when thou walkest by thy way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up, you need to talk about the promises of God. &gt;&gt; When you walk, when you lie down, when you eat, in your dinner. Amen. Let us knock about basketball stars or superstar, whoever. Let us be reminded of the word of God. &gt;&gt; And thou shalt bind them for a sign unto thine hand, and thy shall be a frontlet between thy eyes, and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house, and on the gates. You need to put some scripture in your dining room, in your hallelujah, in your kitchen, in your door, whatever part of your word, you need to have the word of God ATTACHED TO IT SO THAT YOU cannot forget the promises of God when we enter your your your your door. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to put that in remembrance. Don't put any movie stars in that display or basketball star &gt;&gt; cuz Moses said, "And thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house &gt;&gt; and on thy gates and it shall be when God shall have brought thee into the land which he and thy father to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to be to to give thee great and godly cities that thou buildest not." So every promises praise God that we received it was already given to Abraham and we were in Abraham in seed form. So whatever God promised to Abraham we are included in that promises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that's why he said that the houses full of good things which thou feelest not. houses full of good things which thou feelest not and wells dig which thou dst not. So when God Abraham or Moses give them the promised land what they need when they go to the promised land was already provided all the waters the fruit and everything. Even Moses told a land &gt;&gt; filled with milk and honey. They don't need to work it out to plant it and to eat it. No, they just go there and claim the promises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. BECAUSE GOD ALREADY PROVIDED IT. AND GOD IS and Moses is reminding them of the grace of God in their life. &gt;&gt; And house is full of good things which thou feelest not, and well dig with thou dkest not. Vineyards and olive tree which thou plantest not, when thou shalt have eaten and be full. What a great blessing. &gt;&gt; We need to recognize what with whatever we have in our journey, God already provided. &gt;&gt; Our works, our wealth, whatever it is, good health. Praise God. Everything is already provided by God. &gt;&gt; But here is something that God wants to remind you in verse 12. Then beware lest thou forget the Lord which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage. So continue on Deuteronomy 8 10-20. This chapter is to remind them not to forget the blessings of God. &gt;&gt; When thou hast eaten and are full, then thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee. In other words, everything that we do, we need to give thanks unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here again, verse 11, beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God. Remember in the book of Joshua, they serve God. Then after 40 or when the deliver was died, they go back to another gods. Then God send another deliverer. After 40 years, there's another 40 years they go back. They forgot about it. So God is faithful always reminding them of the goodness of his love. Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God in in not keeping his commandment and his judgment and his statutes which I command thee this day, lest thou hast eaten and are full and has built goodly houses and dwelt therein. And when thy herd and thy flock multiply, and thy silver and thy gold multiplied, and all that thou and all that thou hast is multiplied, thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God, which brought thee outpour of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage. So be very careful, &gt;&gt; prosperity doesn't really bear the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; Sometimes he allow it. Remember I I I have so many friends during the time and they said, "Oh brother, thank you that you are blessed by your business. I wish if God bless me, I will serve him more and more &gt;&gt; and God grant their wishes, bless their ministry or bless their businesses." Praise God. But the more blessings that they got, the more they got got away from the Lord &gt;&gt; and they don't go to church anymore, then backslide. Praise God. They enjoy seeing movies, basketball, everything. They forgot that it what they prayed for. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So when they were multiplied and God bless them materially, they forgot the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm trusting that we are not that one. That's why remembering the Lord, &gt;&gt; what the blessings we have is come from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Sometimes God bless you materially so that you can support in the mission field. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; What will you do with your money? You cannot save it in THE BANK BUY AND BUY. Everything will be closed &gt;&gt; and you cannot bring anything. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD USED PRAISE GOD ALL THIS BUSINESSMAN to support a missionary &gt;&gt; because one soul is equivalent to 10,000 words. &gt;&gt; Grandad soul when you support a missionary one soul receive the Lord Jesus Christ. Someday &gt;&gt; you will stand with us all because you support the missionary. Yeah, &gt;&gt; remember the blessings did is not by your by your Yeah, sometimes it's part your struggle you can achieve but don't forget it was the blessings of the Lord. Verse 15, who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness wherein were fiery serpent and scorpions and dro where there was no water who brought thee forth out of the rock of the flimp. Remember, amen. God provided everything. When they rebel against God, God allowed them to be beaten by the by the the fiery serpent. But God always provide a provision for them. A serpent, a brush serpent. And Moses said you if you are beaten by the by the serpent, look at the bracing serpent in the pool. As the prophet said, there is there was no virtue in that pool. Just a brass pool. But you need to have the revelations of the word of God. A brush means it is already judged. Sin is already judged in your life. Amen. Everything that go is already judged. God provided. Praise God. &gt;&gt; provisions for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who fed thee in the wilderness with mana. as they travel in their wilderness, God's so faithful every day. God providing a mana in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that mana when Jesus Christ I am that mana in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is the one who sustain us. &gt;&gt; Who fed thee in the wilderness with mana which thy father knew not that he might humble thee that he might prove thee to thee good thy the latter end. And thou say in thine heart, my power and my mind hath gotten me this will. But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth. &gt;&gt; Remember that &gt;&gt; if God blessed you materially, it was God. &gt;&gt; That he may establish his covenant which he swear unto thy father, as it is this day. And it shall be, if thou do all, forget the Lord thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day, that ye shall surely perish. When God bless you materially, sh it shall be, if thou do all, forget the Lord thy God and walk other gods. And remember, as the prophet said, God is a object of worship. other guys. It may be your car, new brand new car. It may be your sports car. It may be your sports idol or whatever god that you're spend your time with. Some spend their time playing computer games. They forgot to pray. They forgot to they have family. They forgot everything because they have other gods. And the Lord said, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. As the nation which the Lord destroyth before your face, so shall ye perish because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the Lord your God. We need obedience. We need to remember the promises of God in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever happened in our life, whatever we achieve it all by the grace of God in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in Exodus 1:6, and Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all the generation, and the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly mighty, and the land was filled with them. During Joseph reign, everything prospered. Now there was rose up a new king over Egypt which knew not Joseph. Notice a golden age of prosperity and growth until someone forget the story of how God deliver his people. This is type of Joseph. Then the whole nation of Israel suffered and the entire nation of Egypt was destroyed because of one man for God. What a lesson it is for us. So that's why Jude catches up and he wrote it in Jude chapter 1 verse5. I will therefore put you in remembrance. Though you once knew this, how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believe not. So, Joseph, the judges and Jude all these three speaks of the importance of remembrance as well as many other places in the Bible remembering the Lord. People fail because they believe not and they believe not because they have forgotten and they have forgotten because they were failed to be reminded. &gt;&gt; So, faith cometh by being reminded. Faith cometh by hearing the word of God. That's why preachers we have services Sunday, Wednesday to be reminded of the promises of God in our day. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Because faith cometh by hearing and that hearing by the word of God we are being reminded every services of the promises of God in our lives of what he things that he has done &gt;&gt; and what he's doing and he continue to do. It was the grace of God. Amen. So to the evening live fellowships family I want to say thank you for standing serving believing and loving together while we enter the new year. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us pray for one another. Let us try let us continue on and move on. &gt;&gt; Don't let anybody be left behind. Let us continue on. Just like Joshua, he said, "I was 40 years old when Moses sent me to spy the land and I brought him the evidence that the land is good. But now I am 85 years old, but I'm still as strong as when Moses give me the promises." Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why in myself I may have the tear and tears of the age but the joy of the Lord is still my strength. &gt;&gt; I am still praise God &gt;&gt; have strength since I meet praise God THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR THE SAME STRENGTH THE SAME JOY WHEN I RECEIVE THE MESSAGE is the same joy up to now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; As Joshua said that for me and my house we will serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; We need to have the joy in our heart to continue on. &gt;&gt; The joy of knowing that you are a part of God that the know of knowing praise God there your sin is forgiven. The joy of knowing that your sin is being thrown in the sea of forgetfulness never to be remembered again. THE JOY OF KNOWING THAT ONE OF THIS DAY THE BODY CHANGE will start because we have already heard a shout. We have already heard a voice. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. We need to continue moving on and remembering &gt;&gt; that we have a sure word promise in this lesson. God bless you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Mario. Bless you. Amen. Brother Ray Mendoza, if you would come and bless us with a song right now. And then we'll have Jonathan and Maddie McGaryi come and sing right after brother Ray. And then after that song special, we'll have brother Martin Malumba come and speak for us. And just to for the sake of time, just keep things moving along. If you know you're next, if you could be on your way up here as the person is just wrapping up, then we we're not having to wait for you to come and get up here. So, we want to be sure to give brother Ron some time to to speak this evening also for our our communion. So, &gt;&gt; testing. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Ray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, as a new year comes, I have to put it in my heart to ask you a question. If you find yourself a year ago in the same condition today and then what does that say of your walk with Christ? Think about that. This song I'm about to sing, it's in Spanish. And I'm glad I didn't get to sing first because the devil was really messing with me and I was like, "Wait, what?" I couldn't even remember what. So, calm my spirit down, my Lord, and pray for me. Are you the kid? &gt;&gt; [singing and music] &gt;&gt; Y [singing] [music and singing] is be the Get old serves [music] [singing] [music] [singing] [music] [singing] pure. is much [music and singing] more [music and singing] [music and singing] [singing] [music] of it. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; is below.

We shall take the Bible quickly. That might not be uh long at all. Maybe five 10 minutes. But that's grace. uh 2 Chronicles 20:20. And they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of uh Teora. And as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, believe in the Lord your God, so ye shall be established. Believe he is prophet." So shall ye prosper. May the Lord bless the reading of his word. You may be seated. Uh it is uh a privilege, a grace once again to be in the house of the Lord at the year end. uh like uh to take the opportunity to excuse myself because I believe uh last time I was here seems like the communication was not clear to everybody uh since I said that I was having some uh taking new assignments for work but seems like it didn't translate properly and uh seems like there was a lot of questions what's going on and what's happening but forgive me for that I believe Next time we'll try to maybe uh give a little bit more information and also want to thank you all for uh the support of the church and uh everybody uh throughout uh uh the time my wife and I as we were expecting I mean she was expecting uh the Lord has blessed us with uh a little boy and uh a new wonderful experience By God's grace, uh we believe that uh your continuing support in prayer uh in everything uh is certainly welcome. Uh for tonight, I might not take uh as much time. Believe uh we'll leave the rest of the time for later on because uh all this time as I promised you before leaving when we're finishing uh what house will thou build me? uh the Lord had on my heart few subject Jeremiah's ministry that we'll be covering um God in hearts and uh uh wisdom and his child but I believe that uh the time for the time being it's going to be uh Jeremiah's ministry uh we might have to break it into uh three sections and every uh section with few parts. So, you're going to bear with me. So, we're going to take one step at a time. Uh there's no need to rush because we want to make our communication clear so that it's not misinterpreted, misunderstood by God's grace. So, therefore, for tonight, it's just a little overview of the mother Jeremiah's ministry and then uh we'll go about for tonight and uh happy new year. God bless you so much for all Uh thank you brotheron for the opportunity once again and uh everybody was uh asking me what is what was happening. Um we see that in the Bible uh the word of the lord come uh comes to the prophet uh as it comes to the prophet it is uh important for us to receive uh that precious word and uh go about it. That's why uh as we are reading here uh because the whole uh series that we'll be diving into is basically tied to uh what Jehoshaphat says here. I said, "Hear me, oh Judah, as I would say the bride, the church, uh, ye inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in the Lord your God, so shall he be established." You have the first part, you have to believe in God. And you have the second part, believe his prophet, so shall ye prosper. uh when we come u to the Lord certainly uh everybody else out there brother shows us that u uh people make it so hard about what it is to receive the Lord they will tell you you have to do left and right up and down but it says like if you can just challenge gravity when the word comes that's it at times is Well, there's nothing really that I can do. No, there's nothing you have to do because the scripture clearly says you just have to believe him. &gt;&gt; And as simple as that beginning of believing and that principles remain believe all the way. That's why when the prophet came about it says only believe and that by believing we may think that well that belief has to go according to this church doctrine and according to that no he says believe his prophet you shall prosper by believing him he gives you eternal life it's not something a man will have to push you to show you how to receive eternal You just have to believe him. And we like to make it so hard. We believe today and then tomorrow we find ourself into things left and right. Then we question if we believed says the moment that you find yourself in that condition that means you never been converted. But that's why now the king is telling him said, "Hey, hear me as I'm standing today. Hear me out. You just have to believe him. Everything along the journey. Well, I don't see this. I don't understand. This is really the message what it's supposed to be." You just have to believe. And once you believe, he sends his prophet. And once he sends a he pray he's prophet you can do everything else believe him believe God and just walk away. But Abraham tells the sister he says hey I see that you have a question in your heart wondering if uh you're still saved. Say God doesn't save you today to lose you tomorrow. &gt;&gt; And that settles it. You just heard him and that's it. He settles it. But as human beings, we want to feel certain emotions that goes with it. A certain uh dream uh uh somebody come to tell you, I saw you in a vision believing has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; As long as you come to him, you must believe that he is because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; If uh Abraham believed in God and he was imputed unto him for righteousness, so shall it be with you. &gt;&gt; But then now our human part likes to push ourself to do something that I have to go to church. I know it's hard. Well, if you I believe I have to go to church. Yes, that's true. But it's it's not the requirement to be saved because brother Brham says Lot was saved being there in the uh stranger land, but he was saved. He says, well, he brought a lot of uh shame to the word, but nevertheless, he's saved. Believe in God, you shall be established because that eternal life, it's God's own life. &gt;&gt; It's an eternal life. And he gives it to whom he willth. And by him giving that life, it's not a matter of uh you becoming putting your effort into into it. I know parents we like to feel that our children are saved by bringing them to church or serving in the house of the Lord and all that that has nothing to do with it because Manoak and his wife wondered about what Solomon uh Samson why was he doing all these things but they forget that God gave them the child and that's how the pastors like to filled a all the seats are filled but that doesn't contradict the word well Martin does it mean that we have to go and live however you want no because that very life that's the life that we see in the seven church ages he says like I know thy works because he is the first one that began in Genesis one I mean in revelation one the one that died for you and I'm here and along the journey I'll be with you. Because if he's unable to be with you along the church ages, that means that you never been saved to begin with. Believe the Lord your God, you shall be established. And for him, for you now to prosper, he comes and gives you the prophets &gt;&gt; by believing him. You have eternal life. But for you to prosper, you must believe his prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet, the very life of the prophet is the word manifest for the age. &gt;&gt; Because Jeremiah, God told him, raise up, &gt;&gt; go do such a thing. That will be the outcome of Israel. They thought that Jeremiah was crazy, but they didn't see that Jeremiah's life was the very word of God in their day. &gt;&gt; If Jeremiah told them that this is the path to go and you're going into bondage and today the prophet shall also tell us what we have to do in order for us to end up in hell or in heaven. And he says, "See, as far as I'm concerned, people make it so hard. But if you can believe him, but we don't like to believe. We like to reason." We stand with re our reasoning. Oh, you should have been this way. Oh, that this is along the way. But then all those details we'll see that Jeremiah uh in uh Jeremiah 1 it say that then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee because when we come to that point of believing it's not the result of our own desire nobody can come to me unless my father draws him first. &gt;&gt; And for him to draw us, it's because he knew us before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And by knowing us, he knows in what time is he going to bring us in &gt;&gt; and what we shall go through. &gt;&gt; And the way God operates as he did, I believe uh in Exodus 19, they came and said like, you know, we want to talk to God. God came talking to them. They couldn't hear him. So God established a pattern and said, "I'll speak to Moses and Moses will speak with you." &gt;&gt; Because they knew that Moses came to free us. But now they want to find themselves as if they were co-equal with Moses in God's program. They were wanting to have a position differently than what God has given them. That's why God is saying believe him and ye shall prosper. Quran and said like you know well you want to lift yourself higher than any one of us. All of us we have the ministry. Yes you have a ministry but your position is different. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Therefore, your success is bound by you believing his prophets. Before the foundation of the world, I knew thee. Before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee. Well, I have to do this. I have to do that. No. God is telling us, "Believe me, you shall be established." &gt;&gt; Because he already done it. It's a finished work. &gt;&gt; Jesus was uh slain before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And the manifestation of it, brother says, "You were not saved the day you are believing it." &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do with it. But then now the seed word when it comes it said like it's not a person that is predestinated but it is the seed word &gt;&gt; that is predestinated &gt;&gt; and once the seed comes into view now it gets into the land. Therefore, that's why he tells Jeremiah. He said, "Then Jeremiah started uh um excusing, presenting excuses." It says then I said ah Lord Lord God behold I cannot speak for I am a child but the Lord said unto me saying say not I am a child for thou shalt go shall go to all the that I shall send thee and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. Be not afraid of their faces, for I am with I am with thee to deliver thee with said the Lord. Then the Lord put forth his hand and touch my mouth. And the Lord has said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. See, I have uh I have this day set thee over the nations, over the kingdoms to root out. That's Jeremiah's ministry. for him for people to prosper when that seed word comes into place that's why I brought the question of uh Lot because though we are saved we can see Lot's life though we are saved though we shall for us to be able to know how to prosper Jeremiah has to do a certain work and it's not always an easy work to root out to pull down to destroy and that's our comfortable zone. We don't like we don't like to shake to get out of our comfortable zone. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. Jesus would the way I know the word and it is a beautiful work to do with this precious message whereby we see the prophet take that word and go about it into details work with people from all their conditions from their flesh and the clothing the the mind everything that goes in the minds and it goes into the soul and dealing with all those things &gt;&gt; that means now for the person to prosper. Burnham says uh when uh he preached I believe uh why is it so hard for people to live a Christian life he say you see you have eternal life but at times those children once you're born will have the time to read those quotations once you're born at times when you don't follow the word you are living under your privilege &gt;&gt; and because of that you are losing losing the children reward. That's why it says here that believe his prophet &gt;&gt; and you shall do what? Prosper. Because in that prosperity there are principles that are applied placed in &gt;&gt; how to approach divine healing, how to approach marriage, how to approach the church, how to approach the ministry. &gt;&gt; All that &gt;&gt; is bound into this. Believe the Lord your God, you shall be established. &gt;&gt; But then for you to prosper, &gt;&gt; you shall be what? prosper. You are established by believing God. But for you to prosper because many of us will see that we have we go through all kind of things. I believe the word but I don't see this changing. I believe the word but I don't see me progressing in the revelation. Each person is in a uh a certain stage and all those stages are covered by Jeremiah because he's coming to pull down to destroy. And we know that spirits don't change. When you start seeing a resentment, a fight back, you go back to the word, you know that spirit. When you see makeups and you see high heels, you know where all those spirits came forth. Then now the prophets now start taking those things one step at a time. He start showing them until he calls them denominations and then he calls the other the bride. And uh for those now who are called the bride, it's because they've come along a certain journey &gt;&gt; because in Joshua 1, it tells Joshua said, "As I was with Moses, so shall I be with you." But for him, Joshua, to know how God is going to deal with him, it's because he's set with Moses all these years. And you can see the demographic or the ratio in the demographic that followed Moses first. We're not saying that they lost, but here now the prosperity, the success, only two out of a two out of a million was able to make it. Believe him. That's why the prophet says, you see, if you don't obey what I tell you, that means you don't believe. And all these records are set in the word from 47 to 65. And you can see the pattern as the prophet is working along these years. He's showing them look at you Pentecostals, look at you Baptist, look at you fundamentalist, look at you spiritual always zeals. And all those people is taking them one step at a time how to go about these things and how to get to the images of Christ because God has ease of putting forth his word. He said like you know you say that you believe me I believe you but every child that has to come to God must be tried and tested. And that testing, that's Jeremiah's ministry. He's pulling down. He's breaking so that at the end he can present a bride spotless. And that that that work is not an easy work. And those principles applies in our families and in everything in work and countries and all these things. When Jeremiah came and told America, "This is the way to go." America rejected it. By the first value, it seems like it's still going good. But very quickly, he says like, you know, hey, this is already finished. There will be a judgment. He says either it's going to be a depression or it's going to be just a bomb and to take it out. And when we look at all these things, it will hurt anybody being an American to see the homeland that has been built and that has been done all these this work being done to come up to that destruction. So it is also with us. You come to church and you attending, you sing song and you preach and all these things and then at the end to be rejected because they didn't believe Jeremiah. May the Lord bless you. [applause] Thank you, brother Martin. Amen. Sister Deborah, if you'd come and sing for us and then after Sister Deborah, Sister Perfect, if you could come right away, as soon as Sister Deborah is done, and then once Sister Perfect is done, we'll have Brother James come and brother James will speak for us. Amen. Sister Deborah, God bless you. The time has come. Divine [singing] revelation in God's word. His [singing] grace I see when I see how he has chosen [singing and music] me. And it happens [singing] every day when I begin to pray. It burns [singing] within my heart the things he always says. He revealth [singing] unto me [music] what I was born to [singing] be in this day. So I'm staying on my [singing] knees, patiently waiting [singing] on [music] my knees. For your outpouring on [singing] my knees, [music] Lord, I meet you on my [singing] knees. Now I believe [singing and music] that I was born a predestinated [singing] sea. [music] Oh [singing] amazing [music] grace has chosen [singing] me to run this [music] race. So [singing] I will give my life to help perfected without [singing] sin. I can't do this on my own. Lord, put flesh on these [singing] dry bones. [music] If it takes my life to give, [singing] then for you I will live. I need you, [music] Lord. Oh, [singing] so I'm staying on [music] my knees, patiently [singing] waiting on my knees. for your [singing] outpouring [music] on my knees. Oh Lord, I need you on [singing] my [music] knees. I've read [singing] the scriptures in the Bible about the mighty gentile warrior, the painful desire of Hannah and the [singing] fearless move of Esther. Lord, I believe that they were true [singing] and the token they receive. But what about [singing] me? [music] I [singing] know my battles are all won. That's why I sing my song. [singing and music] And I know blessings are all mine. [singing] But it will just take time. So like Elijah, here I [singing] stay with faith in such a way to [music] know you could. [singing] So I'm [music] staying on my [singing] knees, patiently waiting on [singing and music] my knees for your outpouring [singing] on my knees. Oh Lord, [singing] I need you on my knees. [music] So [singing] I'm staying on my knees, [music] patiently waiting [singing] on my knees for your [singing] outpouring on [music] my knees. [singing] Oh Lord, I need you on my knees. &gt;&gt; [singing and music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Just like Shem in the Bible, with all he [singing] went through, [music] he fought by faith with God by his side [singing] overcoming his enemies. In one day, God lifted [music and singing] him. He was the evidence that God conquers. [music and singing] So, you are the evidence of the [music] truth. Yes, the evidence [singing] of his word. Don't give up, no give in. He has [singing] given us the key. Oh Satan, you are [music] late. Whatever you throw at us won't [singing] last. You are dealing with a victorious ride. [music and singing] Oh, we are the evidence of the truth. Yes, the evidence of his [music] word. Don't give up, no give [singing] in. He has given us the [music] key. Oh Satan, you are late. Whatever you throw at us won't last. You are dealing with a victorious [singing] cry. [music] We are reminded of Hannah. She cried [music and singing] all day and night. Oh Lord, do not pass me by. Through her praise and [music] supplications, our God delivered her and by faith she held the evidence in [singing] her arms. Oh, we are the evidence of the truth. Yes, the evidence of his word. Don't give up nor give [music and singing] in. He has given us the key. Oh, Satan, you are late. Whatever [music] you throw at us won't last. You are dealing with a victorious [music and singing] bride. Now in our lives, we've seen it [music] all. The ups and downs, the pain, the grief, and now God has been by our side. [singing] It's not by chance we've [music] conquered. But by grace and grace alone, we are the evidence that God is still alive. Oh, we are the [music] evidence of the truth. Yes, the evidence of his word. Don't give up, [music] nor give in. [singing] He has given us the key. Oh, Satan, you are late. [music and singing] Whatever you throw at us won't last. You are dealing with a victorious [music] fight. Oh, we are the evidence of the truth. [music] Yes. The evidence of his word. Don't give up nor give in. [singing] He has given us the key. Oh Satan, you are late. [music] Whatever you throw at us won't last. You are dealing with a victorious [music and singing] bride. Oh, you are dealing with a victorious bride. [applause and music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; We are the evidence. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, let's turn in our Bibles to Luke 2. Luke chapter 2 and verse 46. And if you say amen fast, I'll try to preach fast and we'll get brother Ron up here. Just a little thought this evening of unfinished business. &gt;&gt; Unfinished business. And so we see here in Luke 2 and uh verse 46. And it came to pass that after 3 days they were found they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions. And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. And when he saw him, they were amazed. And his mother and said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and thy mother have sought thee sorrowing. And he said unto them, "How is it thee that thee has sought me? Wit he not know that I must be about my father's business?" And they understood not the sayings which he spake unto him. You can have your seats this evening. And he said unto them, "How is it that you had sought me which you know that I must be about my father's business?" So we know that Jesus was here in the temple and he was talking at the age of 12 and the age of accountability and you know they misunderstood him &gt;&gt; because the B brother Brandham says that the Bible always corrects the air. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when and when Mary here said you you must he said I must be about my father's business. Well if he was about Joseph's business he would be a carpenter over in a carpenter shop. He would be serving him doing that. But there was a greater thing. There was a greater master that he was serving. There was more important business that he had to do. &gt;&gt; And so we understand that they said that I must be about my father's business. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says the the seed is not heir with the shuck. He said the word yet young spake for itself and know not not that I must be about my father's business. He says there is the secret of the message. Now he says JUST EXACTLY THE FATHER'S BUSINESS. What is the FATHER'S BUSINESS? IF WE WERE TO STOP right there, what is the father's business to you this evening? IS IT JUST GOING TO CHURCH AND PAYING YOUR TITHES AND DOING YOUR DUE DILIGENCE? WHAT is the father's business this evening? &gt;&gt; Because you can read all down through the scriptures and here brother Brandon begins to think uh to quote here. He says, "Could you think of what the father's business was in him? It was to fulfill what ISA ISAIAH SAID, "A VIRGIN shall conceive." HE SAID, "FULFILL WHAT ISAIAH said again, that the lame shall leap like a heart." He said, "All these things would would take place." Like Moses said, "The Lord your God shall raise up a prophet among you likened unto me." It was the father's business to fulfill the word. &gt;&gt; It was the father's business to fulfill the word. AND AS I READ ALL DOWN THROUGH SCRIPTURE, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FATHER'S BUSINESS AND HIM FULFILLING HIS OWN WORD. AND LET ME TELL YOU THIS EVENING, IT'S STILL GOD'S BUSINESS. IT'S STILL THE FATHER'S BUSINESS TO FULFILL his word. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT UP TO YOU AND IT'S NOT UP TO ME. WE DON'T HAVE TO MANUFACTURE CHRISTIANITY AND WE HAVE TO WORK SOMETHING UP. NO, IT'S THE FATHER'S BUSINESS TO FULFILL HIS own word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Yes, it is. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THEN. HE SAYS, "THEN WHAT IS IT NOW? WE MUST BE ABOUT THE FATHER'S BUSINESS." HE SAYS, "YES, SIR. WHAT MUST IT DO?" HE SAYS, "VINDICATE." MALACHI 4:5. LET ME ASK YOU, HAVE THESE THINGS HAPPENED? MALACHI 4:5, LUKE 17:30, HEBREWS 13:8, UH, ST. JOHN 14:12. WHAT IS IT THE GREATER WORK THAT IS HAPPENING IN YOU AND ME? AMEN. &gt;&gt; What did I DO? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; VINDICATED ALL in his word. &gt;&gt; REVELATIONS 10 UH CHAPTER 10, THE OPENING of the seals, the mysteries OF GOD, EVEN SERPENT SEED AND ALL ALL THESE THINGS THAT WOULD BE MANIFEST. MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE AND ALL THESE MYSTERIES THAT HAVE been hid under the pillars all these years from theologians AND SO FORTH. WHAT IS IT'S NOW THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; That's the father's business. It's no more WONDERING WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE FATHER ALL ABOUT? AND SHOULD WE WONDER WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? &gt;&gt; NO. The father's business. NO, WE KNOW EXACTLY what it's about. &gt;&gt; It was THE FATHER'S BUSINESS PAST TENSE AND IT'S STILL THE FATHER'S business in present tense. &gt;&gt; And it's up to God to fulfill &gt;&gt; his business. So let me ASK YOU IF THE FATHER'S BUSINESS IS TO FULFILL HIS WORD AND WE HEAR IT PREACHED OVER AND OVER AND ALL THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THAT YOU ARE THE WORD BRIDE. YOU ARE THE WORD BECOMING MADE FLESH. THE WORD IS COMING INTO MA MANIFESTATION. WHAT IS IT? &gt;&gt; The word being made flesh. AND IF GO IT'S GOD'S DUTY AND HIS OBLIGATION TO MANIFEST HIS OWN WORD AND THAT'S HIS BUSINESS. WHAT DOES THAT MAKE YOU? &gt;&gt; YOU ARE GOD'S BUSINESS. MAKE IT PERSONAL TO YOU. &gt;&gt; I AM THE father's business. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I AM THE FATHER'S BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; In St. JOHN 10 AND 37, HE SAYS, "IF I DO NOT THE WORKS of my father, believe me not. But if I do, though you believe me not, believe the works that you may know and believe that the Father is in me and I in him. &gt;&gt; You will do the works whether you believe it or not. Let me tell YOU THAT WE HAD A PROPHET, VINDICATED PROPHET THAT CAME IN THIS DAY AND YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE NAYSAYERS. YOU CAN HAVE EVERYBODY SAY WHAT THEY WANT. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE WHAT HE SAYS, BELIEVE THE WORKS THAT FOLLOWED AFTER HIM. BELIEVE THE PROPHECIES THAT HE SPOKE AND THE THINGS THAT WERE COMING TO PASS. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "All that the father hath given me will come." &gt;&gt; What is it now that there are still ones THAT ARE STILL COMING, BACKSLIDERS COMING BACK TO US? &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; SOULS TO BE SAVED, &gt;&gt; LIVES TO BE TOUCHED. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE FATHER'S BUSINESS. AS I WAS HEARING THE PROPHET SPEAK TODAY, WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING? &gt;&gt; THE FATHER'S BUSINESS IS SOULS BEING SAVED TO HIS KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; LORD, &gt;&gt; GOD HAS UNFINISHED BUSINESS. THAT'S WHY YOU AND I ARE HERE TODAY. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE HIS WORK ISN'T FINISHED. THERE'S THINGS IN OUR LIVES AND CIRCUMSTANCES AND YEAH, THOUGH WE GO THROUGH THINGS AND THERE'S ONES THAT HAVE CANCER AND SICKNESS AND ALL THAT, BUT LET ME TELL YOU THIS EVENING, GOD'S NOT DONE WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; THE WORK ISN'T FINISHED YET. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE THE FAMILY SITUATION. I DON'T CARE THE BACKSLIDEN CHILDREN. LET ME TELL YOU, GOD HAS UNFINISHED BUSINESS. AND WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT? HE'S THE FATHER IS GOING TO FINISH UP HIS BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. This saying that we have of unfinished business, just listen to what this is. It means a task or issue matter started but completed requiring attention, resolution, closure, WHETHER IT'S A WORK PROJECT, UNRESOLVED CONFLICT, &gt;&gt; lingering emotion, baggage &gt;&gt; with someone. That's exactly what it is. It's baggage. SAINTS OF GOD, IT'S BAGGAGE. LET'S PUT THOSE THINGS BEHIND US. LET'S GO TO THOSE ONES MAYBE YOU'VE OFFENDED, MAYBE SOMETHING'S IN BETWEEN YOU. GO AND FIX THOSE THINGS. Because if you WANT TO BE ABOUT THE FATHER'S BUSINESS, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MEAN BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT HERE FOR PLAYING AROUND AND PLAYING CHURCH AND YOU'RE IN ONE DAY AND OUT THE NEXT. NO, NO, NO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS TO DEAL WITH SOMEBODY WHO MEANS BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; Brother Mario, YOU ALREADY HIT IT. WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS PARTNER WOULD YOU BE? &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING FINANCIALLY AND OH WHAT YOU CAN DO AND THE MONEY YOU CAN MAKE AND THE DEALS YOU CAN DO. NO, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT KIND OF BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS ARE YOU IN YOUR CHRISTIAN WALK? ARE YOU A GOOD STEWARD of your time? ARE YOU FAITHFUL IN EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO? ARE YOU HERE ON TIME AND FAITHFUL IN CHURCH? &gt;&gt; Are you willing TO SERVE THE BODY of Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's Christianity 101 is LIVING FOR OTHERS, SERVING OTHERS. &gt;&gt; That's a truth. &gt;&gt; Lingering emotional baggage with someone. Even spiritual duties left undone. Often carrying a sense of obligation. Emotional weight until it's dealt with. &gt;&gt; Until it's dealt with. Let me tell you, at the close of this this year and the start of a next, let's leave all that baggage behind us. &gt;&gt; Let's let all those weights that so easily beset US AND LET US RUN THE RACE THAT IS SET before us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:10. So for we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, &gt;&gt; which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. &gt;&gt; We are his workmanship. We are his business. &gt;&gt; I think it's time that we set in our hearts at the turn of a year that we mean business. That we mean business with God. That we take God seriously. THAT WE TAKE CHURCH SERIOUSLY. THAT WE TAKE SERVING GOD AND LIVING AND SERVING AND HAVING A CHRISTIAN LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Mean business with God. &gt;&gt; Here he brother Brandham's talking about sons coming into sitting under tutors and governors until appointed time. He says now notice he was potentially placed and then he become a full-fledged son. then his name was was good. HE SAYS THAT'S THE WAY it is the way with the church. If we could get away from our little indifferences and COME TO CHRIST AND FORGET ALL THAT outside world and forget about denominations and so forth and not only just DENOMINATIONS BUT WHAT THIS church is doing IN THE MESSAGE AND THAT CHURCH IS DOING IN THE FORGET ALL THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Run the race. BE A BUSINESSMAN WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; Good advice. ALL THESE OUTSIDE THINGS AND SO FORTH. BE OBEDIENT, CHILDREN, AND BE ABOUT THE FATHER'S BUSINESS TO GET SOUL saved to do the things of God. After a while, he'll set us aside and will anoint us with the Holy Ghost and they will then we are positionally placed in his kingdom. Some has gifts of wisdom and some of knowledge and some gifts of tongues and SOME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL and some prophets AND OTHER GIFTS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT EACH ONE OF YOU, ALL OF US HAVE A A PART TO PLAY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PREACH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SING, BUT YOU you can be faithful. You can say amen to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THESE ARE ALL DIFFERENT POSITIONS IN THE BODY OF CHRIST. THERE'S NO BIG EYES AND LITTLE U'S. THERE'S NOT ONE BIT BIGGER AND BETTER than the other. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every one of us has got to be about the father's business. That's the truth &gt;&gt; ABOUT THE FATHER'S BUSINESS. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT YOU YOU WITNESSED TO A COWORKER or you shared the gospel WITH SOMEBODY OR YOU BEGAN TO SHOW THE LOVE OF GOD OR BOUGHT SOMEBODY A MEAL OR DONE SOMETHING OUTSIDE YOUR COMFORT ZONE? I I THINK MANY TIMES WE WE'RE TOO comfortable in where we're at. Five years ago, watch night is special TO ME BECAUSE FIVE YEARS AGO, our pastor put me in an uncomfortable situation. And he said, "I want you TO TAKE 20 MINUTES." WELL, HOW DID THAT 20 MINUTES TURN INTO FIVE YEARS? And I believe THAT THERE'S MORE GIFTS laying dormant in our CHURCH BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT EXERCISING. YOU'RE NOT GETTING UNCOMFORTABLE. YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE JUST SITTING AND COMING TO CHURCH AND SERVING GOD AND DOING THOSE THINGS. WHAT ABOUT SERVING SOMEBODY ELSE? &gt;&gt; WHAT GIFT DO YOU HAVE? I CHALLENGE YOU IN 2026. FIND THE GIFT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GIFT OR YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS OR WHAT YOUR POSITION IS, FIND IT &gt;&gt; AND SERVE GOD. &gt;&gt; BE OBEDIENT. &gt;&gt; Love God. &gt;&gt; I need you and you need me. We need one another. &gt;&gt; It's going to take every bit of us to make this. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Got to close with this. Ephesians 1 and6. Being confident of this very thing that he which have begun a work in you &gt;&gt; will perform it &gt;&gt; until the day of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Until the day of Jesus Christ. I'm confident in one thing. &gt;&gt; The father's business. &gt;&gt; Amen. that he who has begun a work &gt;&gt; is going to finish it. &gt;&gt; We love you. We look forward to serving &gt;&gt; and we trust that you take these challenges. &gt;&gt; That you live for one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As a body, as a unit, &gt;&gt; let us grow. Let us mature. Let's leave all those things behind us. &gt;&gt; But let us go into our goal. &gt;&gt; The rapture is just before us. Y &gt;&gt; that's what this is all about. When God finishes his business, &gt;&gt; when the last seed, let me put it THIS WAY, WHEN THE LAST SEED BECOMES ABOUT HIS FATHER'S BUSINESS, THE WORK IS FINISHED. THE BUSINESS IS FINISHED. EVERYTHING'S GONE. &gt;&gt; God bless you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother James. Uh Lissa and Lydia, if you could come real quick and we'll turn the service to brother Ron after you sing. And if we didn't get to your song special tonight, Lord willing, we can have you bless us with a song on Sunday. But it's been good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Amen. So the girls would come and bless us with a song and then we'll turn the service right to brother Ron. There is a resting place in the center [singing] of his grace. I long to be in it and so should you. [music] So Lord, guide my way in the sleigh to [singing] see and they I only want to do what you [music] want me to. [singing] Lord, with every step I take, with every [music and singing] move I make, let your Holy Spirit be my [singing and music] guide. Let me always heed your voice when I have to [music and singing] make a choice. I want your perfect will [singing] for my life. So many times we [music and singing] think we're right. Think we have a green light, but find ourselves in God's permissive [singing] will. But oh, [music] what glory and what beauty to be in the line of [singing] duty, his perfect will, I always want to fill. Lord, with every [music] step I take, with every move [singing] I make, let your Holy Spirit be [music] my guide. Let me always [singing] heed your voice when I have to make [music] a choice. I want your perfect will for my life. Then [music] I don't [singing] ever want to be caught doing God a service without his will. [music] Know that he has a plan for me. I [singing] know that there are wonders to fulfill and I [singing] will Lord with every step I take with every move [music] I make. Let your Holy Spirit be my guide. Let me always [music] heed [singing] your voice when I have to make a choice. I want your perfect will for my life. I want your perfect will for my life. [singing] I want your perfect will for my life. &gt;&gt; [singing] [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all this evening. I greet you in the lovely name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Here we are 2025. So very rapidly. Where did it go? &gt;&gt; Where did it go? It &gt;&gt; And the older I am, the faster time goes.

Because here you're going to step into another dimension. You got brother BRENNHAM SAID IT'S JUST FASTER THAN THE one you're in right now. That's why the older we get, &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; THE FASTER IT GOES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'm already on my journey. &gt;&gt; I'm already getting there. &gt;&gt; How about you? &gt;&gt; Amen.

Read the words and if you brethren to get ready, go ahead and and let's turn up the volume so we hear it very nicely. Do we have the sound? Houston, we have a problem. Okay, we'll find out if if they are unable within 30 seconds to get this resolved, we will continue because we have some unfinished business. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't even have my phone. Um, &gt;&gt; yeah. Go get it on my on my desk. It's on the It's on the bookshelf. Ah, there it is. There it is. All right. Let's see if Let's start again. And at the [singing] end of this year, I pause and breathe. Looking back at where you carried me, there were [singing] moments of joy and tears. But your faithful hand was always near. Some prayers answered, some still wait. Some lessons learned through [singing] grace. Every step, every season, you are never [music and singing] far away. At the end of this year, [music] I give you thanks for every [singing and music] road, for every change. Through the [music and singing] highs and through the pain, &gt;&gt; you are shaping who I am. &gt;&gt; At the end [music and singing] of this year, I still believe. You are [music] God [singing] who's faithful. Yesterday, today [singing] the same. Forever you remain. There were [music] doors that [singing] did not open. There were dreams I had to lay down. Still, I learned to trust you deeper. Even [music] when I didn't [singing] understand. In the silence, in the waiting, you were working in my heart. Every moment [music] held a purpose. Nothing ever fell apart. [singing] At the end of this year, I give you thanks [music] for every wrong, for [singing] every change. [music] the [singing] eyes and through the [music] pain. &gt;&gt; You were shaming who I am. At the [music and singing] end of this year, I still believe you are [music and singing] God who's faithful endlessly. Yesterday, [music] today the same forever you remain. I place [music and singing] my future in your hands, all [music] my [singing] hope, all my plans. &gt;&gt; Whatever [music and singing] comes, I will trust your love is more than enough. At the [music] end of [singing] this year, I choose to stand &gt;&gt; with a grateful [singing] heart and lifted [music] hands. &gt;&gt; I step into [singing] tomorrow, trusting you [music] once more. Thank you, Lord. Thank [music] you, Lord, [singing] &gt;&gt; for walking with me through this year. Let's stand together &gt;&gt; at the end of this year. &gt;&gt; I will still believe &gt;&gt; through all that you've brought me through. It's you that helped me. &gt;&gt; It's you that kept me. You did not keep yourself. LET ME TELL YOU, IT IS NOT YOU THAT KEEP YOURSELF. IT IS GOD THAT KEEPS YOU BY THE POWER OF HIS WORD AND THROUGH THE PROMISES OF GOD, HE THAT BEGAN THE GOOD WORK IN YOU WILL FINISH IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; How many of you can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. Let's remain standing and turn with me in your Bibles, please, to Ephesians 1. [snorts] Ephesians 4 verse one. Ephesians 4 verse one. I don't know. I uh I want to be through by 11:15. [snorts] Excuse me. I get a little excited. [snorts] Ephesians 4:1. I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, [snorts] with all loneliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. Notice unity of the spirit with capital S meaning it's got to be God to do it. [snorts] &gt;&gt; There is one body and one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling. One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and father of all &gt;&gt; who is above [snorts] all and through all and in you all. But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and he gave gifts unto men. Now that he ascended, what is it? But that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth. He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all the heavens, &gt;&gt; that he might fill all things. [snorts] And he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some PASTORS AND TEACHERS FOR the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Till we all come into the unity of the faith. Notice verse three said unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. TILL WE ALL COME into the unity of the faith &gt;&gt; and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature &gt;&gt; unto the fullness of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro. &gt;&gt; Correct. carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in weight to deceive, but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ, &gt;&gt; from whom the whole body fitly joined together, and compacted by that which every joint supply, &gt;&gt; according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself &gt;&gt; in love. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Revelation chapter 22. [snorts] Revelation chapter 22. Unfinished business. And the spirit and the bride say come. This verse 17. And let him that heareth say come. And let him that is a thirst come. And whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely. For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book. If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book. And if any man shall take away from the words of the of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. He which testifith these, saying, saith, Surely I come quickly, even amen, even so, come, Lord Jesus. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated this evening in the presence of the Lord. Amen. And I'd like to I I have been overcome [snorts] in the last month in wanting to understand to the greatest emphasis about the uniting time and sign. &gt;&gt; I titled this the uniting time and sign part three. And I want to take a subject for just a short moment this evening is the unity of the faith. Now there's one THING THAT THE DEVIL DOES NOT like and that's for the bride to dwell in unity. &gt;&gt; Because it is his business to divide &gt;&gt; and conquer. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT DIVIDED. LET ME TELL YOU, WE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST ARE NOT A DIVIDED PEOPLE. WE ARE UNITED WITH CHRIST THE word and he is our headship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, yes, we have little divisions and little schisms between us. And I say the closer we get. &gt;&gt; THE CLOSER WE GET TO GOD, THE LESS THOSE THINGS WILL MATTER. WHETHER HE COMES ON A WHITE HORSE OR WHETHER HE COMES ON A WHITE CLOUD, IT DOESN'T MATTER. AS LONG AS WE AGREE THAT HE'S COMING. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SAY, "HE'S COMING." &gt;&gt; I HAVE SEEN. HOW DO I KNOW? BECAUSE A PROPHET IS A SIGN. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. THE WORLD DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THIS END time sign. &gt;&gt; But he said predestinated. &gt;&gt; He said if you're PREDESTINATED FROM THE VERY MIND OF GOD, &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT WHEN GOD FULFILLS HIS WORD, &gt;&gt; do you understand? EVEN AS SISTER PERFECT SAID, YOU'RE THE EVIDENCE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. DO &gt;&gt; YOU REALIZE YOU ARE SITTING HERE TONIGHT AS EVIDENCE THAT GOD SENT A MESSAGE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, WHY ARE YOU HERE? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you're not here to manifest &gt;&gt; GOD'S INTERPRETATION, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE? YOU ARE THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE VERY INTERPRETATION. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LUTHER'S &gt;&gt; PEOPLE THAT FOLLOWED HIS MESSAGE &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY CAME AND THEY RECEIVED WHAT GOD GAVE TO LUTHER AND THE JUST SHALL LIVE BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE THAT GOD WAS INTERPRETING HIS WORD? &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THEY BECAME THE JUST. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE THE INTERPRETATION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY TIME GOD SENDS A PROPHET, &gt;&gt; WHEN THOSE AGREE AND PROSPER, &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THAT PROSPERING TO COME UNDER that anointing? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Get Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let's get with it. &gt;&gt; I mean business. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that. &gt;&gt; How many of you say, "I mean business." &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; I'm not in this thing for second place. &gt;&gt; If you're GOING TO RUN, &gt;&gt; RUN TO GAIN [screaming] THE PRIZE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO FIGHT, FIGHT TO WIN. &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, DON'T even get in the game. &gt;&gt; But if you're going to get in the game, get serious. &gt;&gt; Come on. IT'S ABOUT TIME &gt;&gt; THAT WE PUT ALL OF THESE SINS THAT SO EASILY BESET YOU. &gt;&gt; THESE THINGS THAT WERE THINGS THAT YOU PUT PREEMINENCE ON &gt;&gt; THAT YOU PUT IMPORTANCE ON. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE IS A BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRENHAM SAID THAT WHEN JESUS CHRIST WAS HERE, LISTEN TO ME AND LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY. HE SAID THAT WHEN JESUS CHRIST WAS HERE, HE DID NOT FINISH THE WORK. &gt;&gt; HE LEFT A PEOPLE &gt;&gt; THAT WOULD COME UNDER THAT ANOINTING. THEY WOULD FINISH IT. COME ON. &gt;&gt; They would &gt;&gt; they would FINISH &gt;&gt; WHAT THE PROPHETS PROPHESY. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand &gt;&gt; what are YOU DOING WITH THIS MESSAGE? &gt;&gt; Are you even listening? BECAUSE GOD HAS GIVEN YOU A RESPONSIBILITY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH IT? &gt;&gt; WHY TOY AROUND WITH IT? &gt;&gt; Either get IN OR GET OUT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I must be about my father's business. &gt;&gt; What is his business? fulfilling &gt;&gt; his word. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? Fulfilling &gt;&gt; his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. You and I, my brother, my sister, have got a a great responsibility &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD HAS SENT YOU A PROPHET with a message. &gt;&gt; And you HAD THE ABILITY TO HEAR. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE. THIS EVENING I BEAR EVERY ONE of you RECORD &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT HERE BECAUSE YOU'VE HEARD THAT PROPHET THEN I ASK YOU WHY ARE YOU SITTING HERE? &gt;&gt; Good question. &gt;&gt; Go play your sports. GO DO YOUR GAMES. GO DO THOSE THINGS. BUT IF YOU HAVE GOT AN EAR TO HEAR WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING, &gt;&gt; your ear hears WHAT THE SPIRIT IS SAYING. AND WHEN YOU JOIN YOUR [screaming] VOICE &gt;&gt; WITH THE VOICE OF THE SPIRIT, THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE &gt;&gt; ARE SAYING THE SAME THING. &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE to reiterate. YOU'RE NOT SOME KIND OF PARROT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, BROTHER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; You're living voices. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE the [screaming] evidence. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE EVIDENCE OF MALACHI 4. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE EVIDENCE OF REVELATIONS 10:7. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE EVIDENCE. WHY? BECAUSE 108 TAKES THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You are what you eat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I'm quivering. &gt;&gt; I'm quivering inside &gt;&gt; because I think that sometimes I cannot PREACH IT GOOD ENOUGH to get you to understand. I mean business. [snorts] &gt;&gt; God help me to stir up your pure pure minds &gt;&gt; to put you in remembrance. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT MY MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; NEITHER WAS IT WILLIAM Brandham's message. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "I have no more to do with this message than a voice." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "Against my own better judgment." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "I wanted to go be a trapper." But God &gt;&gt; God made it so serious for him &gt;&gt; that because when he listened to his mother-in-law &gt;&gt; AND HE FOLLOWED HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW'S ADVICE, HE LOST HIS WIFE AND HIS LITTLE BABY. HE SAID, "I I COULD UNDERSTAND. I MIGHT COULD UNDERSTAND. DID YOU TAKE MY WIFE BUT NOT MY Sharon Rose? Do you know why he did it? To make him bear the gravity that there was a bride that had to be preached to &gt;&gt; and he HAD TO TAKE SERIOUS THIS MESSY. &gt;&gt; ANGELS SENT TO HIM, coming to him, giving him THE WORD OF THE LORD. And then you guys &gt;&gt; just sit THERE AND JUST TRY TO ABSORB. I SAY GET INTO IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; If you're NOT LISTENING TO THE MESSAGE, IT'S PROBABLY NOT FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YEAH. I'm not going to baby you and pamper you and tantalize you AND TELL YOU EVERYBODY'S GOING. NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING. THERE'S ONLY GOING TO BE A PREDESTINATED ELECT SEED. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SALVATION. LOT WAS [screaming] SAVED, BUT HE WASN'T SEALED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND? I DON'T WANT JUST SALVATION. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO GO TO THE NEW JERUSALEM. THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME THAT'S SAYING THAT'S MY [screaming] HOME. I WANT MY INHERENT. &gt;&gt; I don't want just salvation. &gt;&gt; Many are called &gt;&gt; but few are chosen. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, are you chosen? Or are you just one of the many? &gt;&gt; Make your calling and your election. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure. Well, I'm not so sure. Well, I'm not so sure about you. I I'm not going to sit here and baby you and pamper you and tell you everybody's going. No, not everybody's gone. Only those who are about the father's business. &gt;&gt; How serious are you about this? &gt;&gt; Do you even get into it? &gt;&gt; Do you read it? &gt;&gt; Do you pray about it? &gt;&gt; Don't you ever have a secondhand revelation? Don't you take mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz mine won't HELP YOU. &gt;&gt; UPON THIS ROCK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU GOT TO HAVE IT FROM THE FATHER. &gt;&gt; GOD, [screaming] COME DOWN AND TALK TO EVERY ELECTED &gt;&gt; AND SPEAK TO THEM AND QUICKEN THEM. &gt;&gt; GET OUT OF YOUR LETHARGY AND you and the LUKEWARMNESS AND LOUD SEE YOU AND GET ON FIRE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BURN. BURN. HOLY SPIRIT. BURN IN ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. [sighs] We are the interpretation &gt;&gt; of this message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Many of THE PEOPLE YOU RUB SHOULDERS WITH MAY NEVER HEAR THAT PROPHET'S VOICE. MANY OF YOU, YOUR COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS MAY NEVER READ A BOOK, &gt;&gt; BUT YET THEY HEAR &gt;&gt; THAT PROPHET'S MESSAGE THROUGH YOU, &gt;&gt; THROUGH YOUR LIFE, &gt;&gt; THEY MAY NEVER READ THE SEALS. THEY MAY NOT KNOW WHAT THE WHITE HORSE RIDER MEANS, &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE EVIDENCE. IT'S YOU THE INTERPRETATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; When you see me, &gt;&gt; you see the message. &gt;&gt; And if you don't, &gt;&gt; then I'm a false reflection. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? I don't want to be some false reflection &gt;&gt; of some kind of a glare of another day. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; let me HAVE &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT REFLECTION &gt;&gt; OF THIS PROPHET &gt;&gt; AND THE LIFE THAT HE HAD. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST UNDERSTANDING THE DOCTRINES. &gt;&gt; It's having his life. those men that came to correct him and told him he was wrong and they were going to pray for him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He didn't GET SOME ARROGANT SPIRIT. DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I'M THE ELIJAH OF this day? DON'T YOU REALIZE THAT [screaming] I'M GOD'S ANOINTED PROPHET? He humbled himself. &gt;&gt; He said, "YOU MEAN TO TELL ME GOD SENT YOU TO PRAY FOR ME? &gt;&gt; YES. THAT GOD WOULD GIVE YOU GREATER revelation than would you please pray? The amazing thing is God answered &gt;&gt; their prayers. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What are you doing with this message? &gt;&gt; 2026 is just a few heartbeats away. What are we doing with it? I I want you to understand and I'm going to declare I've never said this from the pulpit. &gt;&gt; We're changing &gt;&gt; we're changing dimensions &gt;&gt; because when you eat THE BOOK, &gt;&gt; THE FIRST THING THE SPIRIT SAID, "COME UP HIGHER, JOHN." I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, CHURCH, WHEN YOU EAT THIS REVEALED WORD, GOD IS REQUIRING YOU OF A HIGHER DIMENSION, &gt;&gt; SIR. &gt;&gt; BEYOND CHURCH ORDER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BEYOND A LONG DRESS AND LONG HAIR, &gt;&gt; BEYOND HIGH HEELS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS A LIFE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, I wish I could preach. &gt;&gt; I wish I had an ability. I wish I could paint TO YOU &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD HAS DONE AT THIS HOUR. &gt;&gt; I'm being consumed. I'm being overcome. &gt;&gt; I'm going to declare unto you. &gt;&gt; We're changing not only dispensation, brother Brennan, because he says we are changing dispensation. Do you see this anti-semitism coming up? &gt;&gt; Do you see the coming against the Jews? &gt;&gt; Yep. Brother Brennham said in the second world war he said Hitler, Stalin and Mus &gt;&gt; he said our pre-tribulation &gt;&gt; spirits &gt;&gt; you watch this spirit he says it'll rise he says America Revelation chapter 13 &gt;&gt; it starts like a lamb &gt;&gt; two ecclesiastical horns. &gt;&gt; It's got nappy hair. He said like the American buffalo. He says, "But her destiny." Listen to me. You want to know why we have people that are in offices today who are swearing in under the Quran instead of the Bible? Do you know why we have ones who hate America? I SAY TO ALL OF THESE THAT HATE AMERICA, that want to see HER DOWN, I SAY, GO BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE BORN. GO BACK TO WHERE YOU BELONG. &gt;&gt; But even if you sent them, &gt;&gt; it's too late. &gt;&gt; THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FRAUD BY OUR CORRUPTED POLITICIANS IT'S TOO LATE. &gt;&gt; She's going down. &gt;&gt; He says, "I don't pray for America anymore." Says 1956, she rejected the gospel. Listen to me, young people. Trump, okay? He's not a politician. He's a businessman. &gt;&gt; You think it's going to get better? I'm going to tell you it ain't &gt;&gt; because every time they find this billions of dollars of fraud, there's a couple more holes over here that they haven't even uncovered. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's too late. &gt;&gt; So, don't you put your your faith in this system. Don't you put your faith in America. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN. IT IS WRITTEN ON THE WALLS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S THUS SAYAITH [screaming] THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Judgement &gt;&gt; is at our doors. &gt;&gt; Some of you have been playing around. Musicians, if you'll come here, [snorts] I haven't even begun. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. I will. You know, Brother Bram says, "I never really finish my sermon." He says, "I let the people just go home and rest. This is a never &gt;&gt; ending story. &gt;&gt; It's the greatest story that's ever been told &gt;&gt; and it's so great and it's so marvelous. It's never even entered into the mind of man. No thought could make it so grand. Let me tell you, don't you miss it? You young people, you older ones alike. Let let me beg you if I could. Let me beg you. Don't miss it. &gt;&gt; Amen. What price would you put ON THE GOSPEL? [snorts] WHAT PRICE WOULD YOU SELL him out &gt;&gt; for a few pieces of silver FOR SOME KIND OF CAREER IN THIS LIFE, A LITTLE BIT OF EASE? I beg you, if you haven't made that decision, make it right now. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOT A NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION BECAUSE IT'S NOT RESOLUTION. You make a resolution next week, you break it. If I could, if I could, if I could quicken you, if I could MAKE IT SO REAL THAT the fear of God would strike some of you cuz you know you've been playing with it. And I say you got an opportunity right now. &gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW TO SAY THE BUCK STOPS HERE. &gt;&gt; I MUST be &gt;&gt; about my father's history. Something's happening even right now. My right eye is it's blind. I can't see out of it. Maybe I'm just too serious. Brother Billy. You could have stayed home tonight. Your mama made you a big old meal for your brothers. You guys, you could have stayed home and it would have been all right. It would have been nice, but something compelled you. You said, "Brother Ron, I've got to come." &gt;&gt; I said, "You chose the better part. Amen. &gt;&gt; You did. You chose the better part because right now, you know what God's doing? He's causing some of you right now in your seat where you're at under the under the the presence of God right now. You know, you have not really gotten real serious with this. And God is giving you a time right now. Yes. &gt;&gt; I don't need you to bow your head and close your eyes. Them days are over. &gt;&gt; Them days of trying to coax and [music] and and comp. &gt;&gt; It's time for you to take a stand. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU HAVE DONE ALL TO [screaming] STAND. &gt;&gt; STAND. &gt;&gt; Didn't say sit down. didn't say lay down. &gt;&gt; It said stand. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I make a declaration in front of all of you. &gt;&gt; I will stand. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If nobody else stands, &gt;&gt; this is my day &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS MY HOUR. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND I WILL NOT SHUCK OR SHERK MY RESPONSIBILITY. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRENNHAM SAID, "IF I GET THAT BRIDE TO STAND STILL LONG ENOUGH, &gt;&gt; you know what he said, Paul? I'll dress her with the word." &gt;&gt; All you got to do is stand still long enough. I read to you that quote where brother Bram says, "God created himself &gt;&gt; his own bride." &gt;&gt; She's a mail order bride. &gt;&gt; You know what? Don't tell nobody. It's a great secret. &gt;&gt; She's the mystery &gt;&gt; of the mystery. But she's about to be unveiled &gt;&gt; cuz God's unveiling her. How's he doing it? By his word. &gt;&gt; You think it's you. &gt;&gt; It's got nothing to do with you. &gt;&gt; Has to do Bo has to do with the seed that lays inside there. He said, "I predestinated you. I ordained you. &gt;&gt; I called you before their world was even &gt;&gt; I CALLED YOU. I PLACE ON YOUR FINGER UNMMERITED [screaming] FAVOR. AND THAT'S WHY WHEN I SENT A VOICE, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU HAD AN EAR TO HEAR. [screaming] THAT'S WHY YOU BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AMEN. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am the voice. &gt;&gt; The spirit and the bride &gt;&gt; say, "Come." &gt;&gt; I say unto you, come. &gt;&gt; I say unto you that have never said yes. Say it now. &gt;&gt; Quit playing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't need you to come to an altar. The altar's in your heart. &gt;&gt; Just say yes. That's all. The angel that came to Mary, [snorts] he could not leave Mary until the business was finished. &gt;&gt; That's correct. until all these salutations and angels and blessed art thou Mary &gt;&gt; among all women. [sighs] &gt;&gt; She pondered these things in her mind. How can this be? &gt;&gt; How can it be? AND WHO AM I &gt;&gt; THAT I WOULD HAVE THE CHRIST CHILD? I WANT TO ASK YOU, WHAT KIND OF PERSON ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; GOOD QUESTION. &gt;&gt; WHO ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; I WILL TELL YOU, JUST AS MARY WAS A RECIPIENT OF A WORD FROM AN ANGEL, &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BEEN ORDAINED [screaming] TO RECEIVE &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S TRANSFORMING YOU. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YEAH. &gt;&gt; Hurry up. &gt;&gt; He sent his angels. He sent vindications and signs. And then he sent apostles, some of them, some evangelists, some pastors. For understand this, that no man takes this glory [music] to himself. If I've ever preached a sermon, if any one of these brethren here or anyone that stood behind this pulpit has ever preached a sermon that quickened your soul, it wasn't the man. &gt;&gt; It was God using the gift. I can't help nobody. &gt;&gt; But if I can get myself out of the way, &gt;&gt; and I let him live through me. &gt;&gt; Maybe God was speaking to you tonight through a gift. &gt;&gt; You said it wasn't Brother Ron. It was the gift. If you look beyond the veil many times, brother Brenham said, he says because the way God ve himself, he says many people miss it because God changes his mask. You understand? You know what God's doing? &gt;&gt; God's becoming immorph. in flesh. &gt;&gt; It's in you. This mystery that's been hid down through the ages. Do you know what this mystery is? Let me tell you. Don't never forget it. It's Christ &gt;&gt; in you, Frederick. &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you, &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. Benjamin, son of the right hand. &gt;&gt; You know why you believe this message? Because you was ordained. Sister Marty, you was ordained. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Rebecca, my daughter, &gt;&gt; you was ordained &gt;&gt; to hear this message. called before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Brother Brighton, who was it that called you, that made you believe what you believe? Brother Johnny. Why? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE MANY HAVE LOST THEIR WAY AND THEY'VE LEFT AND THEY'VE GONE HERE AND THERE AND HIT THE DITCH. BROTHER ANDY, DO YOU KNOW WHY YOU BELIEVE WHAT YOU BELIEVE? I'm I'm done. I wish I could just grab arms with all of you and just say, "Okay, let's let let's go together." &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's let's let's just go together. How many of you say &gt;&gt; do it? Come, let's do it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the brothers asked me tonight, did you send me your notes? I said, no. I said, I don't even know how far I'll get into my message. Brother Stephen, I told you, you said, "Brother Ron, you going to have all the brothers?" I said, "No, that's okay. You preached last Sunday." It's okay. And that what you were going to preach tonight, save it for [music] next service. Listen, the dispensation of Revelations 10:7 has come and gone in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound. Has he sounded? &gt;&gt; Has he brought forth his message? &gt;&gt; But now there's another voice. &gt;&gt; It's the same voice. It's in another vessel. &gt;&gt; It went from one to a many members. &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; It's called the mystical body. That's what you are, &gt;&gt; Vincent. That's what you are. &gt;&gt; You think Amos just visited with [music] you and talked to you and everything. What brings you keep coming back? Why do you keep coming? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What's the name of this song? &gt;&gt; My hope is in the Lord. Just for a moment this evening. Just for a moment. Let's worship him.

You say, "Tonight's my night. &gt;&gt; This is my day. &gt;&gt; This is my time. I drive the stake. I put the pillar down. I [music] said, "This is my day. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of running. &gt;&gt; And if I'm going to run, I want to run to gain the prize." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Would you come here and find first Corinthians 11? Come here. Let me see. Let me see. Here it is. Here it is. Thank you. Would you hold me up? Thank you. [snorts] 1 Corinthians chapter 11. I want to ask you the prophet the last several sermons he preaches. &gt;&gt; Why do you think he preaches about the rapture? what house you will build. &gt;&gt; And for several sermons in a row, he just keeps building. And he keeps building &gt;&gt; and he he preaches the last what's the last sermon he preaches? &gt;&gt; Communion. &gt;&gt; What does communion mean? &gt;&gt; It comes from the word communication. what God is doing right now with the bride. &gt;&gt; He's communicating &gt;&gt; for faith cometh by hearing &gt;&gt; and hearing by the word of God. You want more &gt;&gt; faith &gt;&gt; increase your hearing. Let this be the year &gt;&gt; that you increase your hearing &gt;&gt; and you increase your reading. &gt;&gt; Just just just hold me. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 11:23. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread. And when he had given thanks, he broke it. What did he do on the road to Emmas? He broke bread. What was the bread he was breaking? He said, "I am the bread &gt;&gt; which came down from heaven. Your fathers ate mana in the wilderness under everyone dead. He said, "I am the bread." And when he took the bread, he break it. What was he breaking? The word, the mystery. [snorts] And when he had given thanks, he break it, take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me, &gt;&gt; brother Mario. Remember me. &gt;&gt; That thief on the cross, he said we deserve what we're getting, &gt;&gt; but he doesn't. How dare you revile against him? And he just turned to Jesus and he said, "Would you remember me when you come into your kingdom?" &gt;&gt; Never heard a sermon, never lived a day for God. Would you remember me? He says, "I tell you, &gt;&gt; says this day you'll be with me." &gt;&gt; How did he get there? He wasn't baptized. &gt;&gt; All he did was said, "Remember me." And I say this, these magical words to someone here tonight, say, "Remember me. Would you raise your hand if you say remember me tonight? &gt;&gt; That's it. Remember me. Just remember me. Excuse me. Excuse me. And after the same manner also he took the cup. [snorts] And when he had sbed, saying, "This cup is the new TESTAMENT IN MY BLOOD. THIS DO YE as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. [snorts] For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, YOU DO SHOW THE LORD'S death till he come. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning [snorts] the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, &gt;&gt; judge yourself right now. &gt;&gt; If we would judge ourselves, &gt;&gt; we should not be judged. But when we are judged, [snorts] we are chasened of the Lord. Any son that is without chastisement is not his son. &gt;&gt; That's correct. He's based. &gt;&gt; Excuse me, that's rough language. He's not begotten of the father. He will not receive correction. He will not listen to his father. [snorts] When you're chasen of the Lord, we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore my brethren, when you come together to eat ty one for another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that you come not together unto condemnation. The rest will I set in order when I come. Brother [snorts] Brennan made reference to that scripture, the rest will I set in order when I come. He said, that's why God sent me here, to set the church in order. The rest will I set in order. God bless you, brethren. Faithful men, we can bring it up here. I'll be all right. I have the pulpit to lean against. I'm going to come down here. That's okay, Amos. I think I'm okay. I'm okay. I just got a little excited. How many of you believe that this gospel is worth getting excited about? &gt;&gt; I used to go to ball games. When I go to a ball game, I GOT INTO IT. YEAH. HIT IT. BACK TO THE WALL. YOU CAN TOUCH IT ALL. YEAH. But when I became a man, &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; You brethren know that while I break this bread, Father God, in the name of Jesus Christ, I break this bread. You said, "Take, eat. This is my body. Father, the body you broke in this hour was the veil of the body of Christ. And you unveiled the mystery of God. And you said, "If you've seen me, you have seen the father." &gt;&gt; We've seen the unveiling of God in this day. Melazdc &gt;&gt; came down. Who is this Melzdc? Who is this? What? What is this attraction on the mountain in the Coronado Forest of Arizona? Why Sunset [snorts] Mountain? Because it was evening time. Father, bless this bread and those that partake of it. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; No, just leave it there all. Father God, I lay my hands upon these canisters that hold within it a cup. You said, "Drink of this cup." This cup is the New Testament in my blood. this do as often as you remember me. Father, I pray bless this wine. May there be a greater wine &gt;&gt; that will bless this wine. &gt;&gt; And grant to everyone &gt;&gt; the stimulating power &gt;&gt; of the quickening of the revealed word. and may they become the word in flesh. &gt;&gt; May they be about their father's business. &gt;&gt; I pray in Jesus Christ name. Amen. [snorts] All right. All right. You can be seated until they dismiss you row by row. And then if you would if you'd come, please let's not t go ahead and let's come quickly because we have a short time until 12:00. That's it. Bless each one, Father that comes this evening. These young men, these young women, predestinated, ordained. So let them eat of that bread and drink of that. come that whosoever will let him come. That's it. That's it. Lord, thank you. Bless these that come. You have a need. Bring that need to ask. This shall be given. Seek, you shall find. What if you have need of? Speak it. That's it. Bless your people, Father.

That when I was in Europe and we had no church to go to, there was one night that I gathered my family in the upper room and we all knelt down. Do you remember that, Rebecca? God bless you as we go. &gt;&gt; [crying] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. It's a new year. It will be a good year. It will be a year of victories, &gt;&gt; more victories than defeat. There's a movement in America called the turning point. That's a natural reflection of something that's spiritually been going on for quite some time. How many of you have already had your turning point &gt;&gt; when you heard the voice &gt;&gt; of the seventh angel? &gt;&gt; I shall turn aside. I shall go and listen and I will see what is this attraction. What is all this mystery? What is all these signs for? Amen. Where is Sister Perfect? Is she still here? &gt;&gt; Sister Perfect.

Where did you get this song? &gt;&gt; Um, this is a song that the Lord gave me and I wrote No, I didn't write it. The Lord wrote it through me. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Do you know how original songs come to pass? through fiery trials. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And through the things you go through, you know what God does? &gt;&gt; He births &gt;&gt; a song.
