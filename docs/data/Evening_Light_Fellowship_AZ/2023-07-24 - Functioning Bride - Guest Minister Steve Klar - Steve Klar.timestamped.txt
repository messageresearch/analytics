[1:00:20] praise this morning you've come and

[1:00:24] and so I thank you Lord for that this
[1:00:26] morning

[1:00:29] take this word and would you break it
[1:00:31] before your people
[1:00:33] Lord would you open our eyes to see may
[1:00:36] you give us inspiration today to receive
[1:00:40] Lord may it not just be hearing from
[1:00:42] flesh and blood but Lord may it be
[1:00:45] hearing Lord From The Throne of almighty
[1:00:47] God

[1:00:50] asking that you would take this word
[1:00:53] that we've already heard nothing's new
[1:00:54] Lord the prophet God brought it to us
[1:00:57] and we're going to say what he said

[1:01:08] your word I pray father for those that
[1:01:11] are afflicted in body I pray in the name
[1:01:14] of Jesus Christ that they would reach
[1:01:17] and Touch the Hem of your garment this
[1:01:19] morning and that they would be healed
[1:01:21] Lord by the spoken word we can be healed
[1:01:23] by the preaching of the word we can be
[1:01:25] healed this morning and so father We
[1:01:27] Believe with all our hearts that you
[1:01:29] were wounded for our transgressions and
[1:01:32] Brew is Lord for our iniquities and by
[1:01:34] your stripes Lord this morning we can be
[1:01:37] healed in our bodies Lord our Spirits
[1:01:40] can be healed this morning Father you

[1:01:53] and this we give you thanks
[1:01:55] We Believe Lord with all of our heart
[1:01:58] in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen
[1:02:03] why don't you turn in your Bibles with
[1:02:05] me to Genesis chapter 2
[1:02:08] Genesis chapter 2 and
[1:02:11] we just want to read one scripture verse
[1:02:13] here in Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 and
[1:02:18] then we will also read the first portion
[1:02:20] of Isaiah
[1:02:22] chapter 49 and verse 1 in just a moment
[1:02:27] amen
[1:02:29] I have some slides on the screen this
[1:02:31] morning and amen I trust that
[1:02:34] that will help you this morning to see
[1:02:37] exactly what the prophet has said what
[1:02:39] the scriptures have said we want to
[1:02:41] identify with that this morning
[1:02:45] Genesis chapter 2 verse 7.
[1:02:49] and the Lord God formed man of the Dust
[1:02:52] of the ground
[1:02:55] and breathed into his nostrils
[1:02:58] the Breath of Life
[1:03:01] and Man became
[1:03:04] a living soul
[1:03:06] the Lord blessed the reading of this
[1:03:07] word we can take our seats this morning
[1:03:12] I'd like to speak to you this morning on
[1:03:15] a little fodder
[1:03:17] as I was meditating in my study I
[1:03:20] desired that God would encourage us
[1:03:23] I had a desire that God would bring a
[1:03:26] positive message of the word to us this
[1:03:29] morning
[1:03:30] we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:03:33] now some of you don't know who I am but
[1:03:36] I've been raised in this message and
[1:03:38] I've loved the Lord since I was a little
[1:03:40] boy
[1:03:42] but I want to share to you this morning
[1:03:44] that that we need to be a people that
[1:03:48] are formed we are filled but my thought
[1:03:50] this morning is that we need to be a
[1:03:53] functioning bride
[1:03:55] of Jesus Christ
[1:03:57] and we read in our text this morning
[1:03:59] that the Lord God he formed he formed
[1:04:03] man from the dust of the ground and he
[1:04:05] he breathed the breath of life into him
[1:04:07] into his nostrils he breathed eternal
[1:04:10] life inside of him and he became a
[1:04:13] living soul
[1:04:15] a soul that cannot die the prophet of
[1:04:18] God would say or he became a functioning
[1:04:21] living soul
[1:04:22] and as we begin to unpack this thought
[1:04:24] the brother Brad will say we we want to
[1:04:26] get you know a little honey right up to
[1:04:28] the elbows we we want to just to immerse
[1:04:30] ourselves in what God has for us
[1:04:34] Isaiah in Isaiah 41 verse 1. he speaks
[1:04:39] an under inspiration and he writes he
[1:04:41] says the Lord hath called me from the
[1:04:45] womb
[1:04:46] and from the bowels of my mother hath he
[1:04:49] made mention of my name
[1:04:52] from the beginning of time from the
[1:04:54] foundation of the world as you've heard
[1:04:57] it many times but as I encourage you
[1:04:59] again before the foundation of the world
[1:05:02] God has called us to be a people
[1:05:06] God has chosen us for this time to be a
[1:05:10] bride we're not looking to yesteryears
[1:05:13] or in a glare of another time but we're
[1:05:16] looking at what God in this present time
[1:05:18] has appointed us to be
[1:05:21] and we must understand and must grasp it
[1:05:24] bring it to our bosoms begin to believe
[1:05:27] with all of our hearts that there is an
[1:05:30] importance for our becoming
[1:05:32] there is an importance of why we are
[1:05:35] here today in 2023.
[1:05:39] you know friends it's no matter how
[1:05:42] instant insignificant we all feel and I
[1:05:45] I want to tell you and I want to be
[1:05:47] personal to you today sometimes we very
[1:05:50] feel very insignificant
[1:05:53] sometimes in our goings of our life and
[1:05:56] the things that we we do we find
[1:05:58] ourselves in faults and we find
[1:06:00] ourselves in failures and but I want to
[1:06:04] tell you today that God is taking a
[1:06:06] picture of you from your the beginning
[1:06:08] of your time and he sees the ending of
[1:06:11] your time
[1:06:12] the in-betweens that we go through it's
[1:06:15] the blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses
[1:06:18] us from all unrighteousness and and all
[1:06:21] sins and all our afflictions and so we
[1:06:25] have been formed for this season he knew
[1:06:29] our name and we often sing that song He
[1:06:32] Knows My Name
[1:06:34] he's recorded my name not only in The
[1:06:37] Book of Life when we were all born but
[1:06:39] it's most important that we recognize
[1:06:42] that our names have been put on the
[1:06:45] Lamb's Book of Life and that our lives
[1:06:48] are covered this morning by the
[1:06:50] sprinkling of the almighty God the power
[1:06:53] of the blood and so he knows her names
[1:06:57] he knows us he knows our thoughts he
[1:07:00] knows our feelings he knows every
[1:07:02] expression that we have in our lives
[1:07:06] brother Branham in this message in 1951
[1:07:10] in faith is the substance he says and
[1:07:13] men are regenerated
[1:07:16] made a new person sealed into the
[1:07:19] kingdom of God by the Holy Spirit
[1:07:22] the life of Christ's pressed into them
[1:07:26] and I want to underline that I I want
[1:07:29] that to bring in bold the life of God
[1:07:32] pressed
[1:07:34] Into You and I
[1:07:37] all their drinking and immoral habits
[1:07:40] and everything go out the love of God is
[1:07:44] like a notary republic takes a seal and
[1:07:48] presses it into the inscription of the
[1:07:50] seal it's it presses in the paper over
[1:07:54] the signature thank you Lord
[1:07:56] oh my and when Christ signs your name on
[1:08:01] The Book of Life and the Holy Spirit
[1:08:02] presses it in there until the Life of
[1:08:06] Christ is formed in you
[1:08:09] the prophet of God would say hallelujah
[1:08:12] becomes deity
[1:08:14] this morning I think we can rejoice
[1:08:18] your name has been written on the Lamb's
[1:08:20] Book of Life deity has been pressed into
[1:08:24] your very being the prophet of God would
[1:08:27] say we are called Messiahs or you would
[1:08:30] say that we are Gods with a small G
[1:08:32] which means that we are our sons and
[1:08:35] daughters of God with the living
[1:08:37] elements
[1:08:39] up gone on the inside of Us Praise His
[1:08:43] Name
[1:08:45] in first John in our scripture reading
[1:08:47] in first John chapter 3 verse 2. he says
[1:08:51] now I beloved now
[1:08:53] are we the sons of God
[1:08:58] can you understand can you feel that
[1:09:01] pulsation within your heart to say I am
[1:09:04] a son or a daughter of God
[1:09:07] no matter your test no matter the trial
[1:09:10] the struggle you went to this week and
[1:09:12] we have gone through some struggles this
[1:09:14] week no doubt when you are painting and
[1:09:17] you were placing carpet in this room
[1:09:19] there was brother Amos there was some
[1:09:22] struggle some some humanness that came
[1:09:24] out but by the grace of God
[1:09:27] God's not looking at our humanness this
[1:09:30] morning he's not looking at your
[1:09:32] failures this morning he's looking at a
[1:09:34] representative of himself a
[1:09:37] representation of his very Life In You
[1:09:41] and I now we have become Sons and
[1:09:45] Daughters of Gods
[1:09:47] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:09:50] be
[1:09:51] but we know that when he shall appear
[1:09:55] we shall be like him
[1:09:58] for we shall see him as he is
[1:10:02] I want to tell you this morning we have
[1:10:05] a scene appearing of his coming he has
[1:10:08] spoke to us today in this hour he spoke
[1:10:11] to us by a prophet and we have seen his
[1:10:14] coming spiritually and we will see him
[1:10:16] but now we are called
[1:10:20] to be Sons and Daughters of God
[1:10:23] the prophet God would mention to us and
[1:10:25] tell us many times that you know we we
[1:10:28] often look at the Times past or the at
[1:10:30] the past things that are happening or we
[1:10:32] look to the time of the future but the
[1:10:35] prophet of God tells us we need to look
[1:10:37] to the present
[1:10:38] we need to see what's happening right
[1:10:40] here right now and in this season and
[1:10:43] I've come to you this morning with my
[1:10:45] heart filled with God's love to tell you
[1:10:47] now
[1:10:50] you are Sons
[1:10:52] now you are Daughters of God
[1:10:56] greater than Solomon is in our midst
[1:10:59] this morning he has called us this
[1:11:01] morning to walk in his fulfillment of
[1:11:04] his word
[1:11:06] now we are individuals and we've been
[1:11:08] called to walk with God as individuals
[1:11:12] and brother Brian would tell us God has
[1:11:14] got no grandchildren you can't come to
[1:11:16] to God by some other way you can't come
[1:11:19] on the expressions of brother Ron
[1:11:21] Peterson or or my pastor John Andy's or
[1:11:24] any other minister or grandfather or any
[1:11:26] type you have to come has an individual
[1:11:30] before God
[1:11:31] and as we come as individuals speak for
[1:11:34] God we recognize that we are part of a
[1:11:37] great big picture God has got a
[1:11:41] spiritual body that we call the bride
[1:11:44] and we have been formed and taken from
[1:11:46] his side from every nation every country
[1:11:50] every money of speaking of of language
[1:11:52] God has called the people to be taken to
[1:11:56] be formed to be brought forth and an
[1:11:58] hour to be born of his bone
[1:12:03] flesh of his flesh the body of Christ is
[1:12:07] not male it's not female but it's called
[1:12:10] The Bride each one United in this body
[1:12:16] I want to tell you it's a body like his
[1:12:19] own glorious body
[1:12:21] a body that's formed in his very own
[1:12:25] image
[1:12:26] when you walk in the markets when you go
[1:12:30] to your places of jobs this morning I
[1:12:33] want to tell you that you are the image
[1:12:35] of God
[1:12:36] you are speaking to the people to the
[1:12:39] world out that Jesus Christ he's the
[1:12:42] same yesterday today and forever it's
[1:12:45] your life that is thundering out loud
[1:12:48] we are formed in this image of God
[1:12:52] in First Corinthians chapter 12 Paul the
[1:12:55] Apostle in verse 12 he begins to speak
[1:12:58] about this body and he says for as the
[1:13:01] body is what
[1:13:03] and have many members
[1:13:06] and all the members of that one body
[1:13:08] being many are one body
[1:13:10] so also is Christ
[1:13:14] for by one spirit
[1:13:17] we are baptized into one body whether we
[1:13:21] be jew or Gentile whether it be Bond or
[1:13:25] free and have been all made to drink in
[1:13:29] one spirit for the body is not one
[1:13:31] member but many
[1:13:34] and then in verse 15 and for the sake of
[1:13:36] time we won't read it but through 15-26
[1:13:38] he begins to describe that you may be
[1:13:41] will you be the foot or you might be the
[1:13:44] hand or you might be the eye or the lip
[1:13:46] or whatever you might be but you ought
[1:13:48] to work in that in that placing that God
[1:13:51] has put you in we can't all operate in
[1:13:55] the same token in the same way God's got
[1:13:58] a great economy we can't all be
[1:14:00] beautiful singers like we've heard this
[1:14:03] morning that was some beautiful worship
[1:14:06] unto the Lord
[1:14:07] but we can't all be singers
[1:14:10] we can all be deacons or preachers God
[1:14:14] is calling women to be mothers and and
[1:14:18] men and women to be Witnesses and to go
[1:14:21] forth and preach the gospel we all have
[1:14:23] a job to do in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:14:26] we have been formed hands and feet and
[1:14:30] eyes and so on to do exactly the work of
[1:14:34] Almighty Mighty God
[1:14:36] verse 27 we would read now ye are the
[1:14:39] body of Christ now it is and members in
[1:14:45] particular
[1:14:46] you've got a job to do I want to
[1:14:48] encourage you this morning you've got a
[1:14:50] job to do
[1:14:52] go into the world be a witness I'm
[1:14:55] encouraging this morning
[1:14:57] to go find that last seed you are all
[1:15:01] ministers maybe not fightful Ministry
[1:15:04] but we all have a Ministry to speak in
[1:15:08] particular
[1:15:10] what God has for us
[1:15:13] in the message expectation in 1951
[1:15:18] God has always had a Remnant somewhere
[1:15:21] and he's got a Remnant tonight don't you
[1:15:24] believe that I say Amen now tonight A
[1:15:28] remnants are composed of his body his
[1:15:31] spiritual body here on the earth
[1:15:32] baptized
[1:15:34] people into the body making us the body
[1:15:38] of Christ
[1:15:40] I want to underline that word baptized
[1:15:43] because we have been fully baptized or
[1:15:46] fully immersed or we have plunged fully
[1:15:49] head long and fully persuaded to be a a
[1:15:54] part of his body part of his flesh we
[1:15:57] give ourselves completely to him
[1:16:00] can you can you walk down memory lane
[1:16:03] with me just for a moment when God
[1:16:04] called you
[1:16:06] none of us was looking
[1:16:09] we were looking for God but he was
[1:16:11] looking for us
[1:16:14] and when he called us and and he poured
[1:16:17] his love we'll talk about that in just a
[1:16:19] moment but when he poured his love upon
[1:16:22] us we couldn't help but love back
[1:16:25] and you can't serve God half-heartedly
[1:16:29] you can't live on one side of the fence
[1:16:31] to the other you have to be a baptized
[1:16:34] people uh fully immersed people a people
[1:16:38] plunged into the the Fountain of Life
[1:16:41] you need to be fully persuaded that he's
[1:16:44] the Conqueror the captain the Creator
[1:16:48] we are formed to be the body of Christ
[1:16:53] you know I look in the scriptures and
[1:16:56] we look at Jeremiah
[1:16:58] when the Lord spoke to Jeremiah over
[1:17:01] and he said come on over Jeremiah and I
[1:17:04] want you to go to The Potter's House how
[1:17:06] many can remember that
[1:17:08] and so Jeremiah Jeremiah under
[1:17:11] inspiration he goes to the power of
[1:17:13] Potter's House and sure enough the
[1:17:15] Potter he was there and he was working
[1:17:18] on the Wheel
[1:17:20] and as we watched Jeremiah speak he sees
[1:17:23] the pottery he's spinning the clay he's
[1:17:27] making a vessel and as he's spinning
[1:17:29] this vessel in the clay we notice that
[1:17:32] there are some marred pieces some some
[1:17:36] broken places some some spots that would
[1:17:39] not be good in a beautiful vessel
[1:17:42] and I I want you to take a very close
[1:17:45] notice that as the Potter is working on
[1:17:49] the clay he never tosses
[1:17:52] the clear way
[1:17:55] now this is making me Rejoice I've been
[1:17:57] I'm overwhelmed within my being
[1:18:00] because he never tossed me away
[1:18:05] even when I'm a Son of God and find
[1:18:08] myself in some time human failure
[1:18:11] because this flesh is not saved it is my
[1:18:15] worst enemy
[1:18:18] but although I find some Mars that are
[1:18:22] there within the vessel the Potter never
[1:18:25] tosses it away he merely removes that
[1:18:29] Mar and begins to spit Hallelujah he
[1:18:34] begins to move actually again he begins
[1:18:38] to transform by the word of God and
[1:18:42] gives us a renewing of our mind gives us
[1:18:45] Christ's nights
[1:18:48] her to process France
[1:18:50] when you're born into the spirit of God
[1:18:52] you don't aren't born in a mature you're
[1:18:56] born in as a babe into the economy of
[1:18:59] God and there are times where you fall
[1:19:01] there's times where there's failures but
[1:19:04] God is faithful
[1:19:06] to take those things front of our lives
[1:19:08] and keep molding on our being
[1:19:14] I think many times we can take comfort
[1:19:16] in
[1:19:18] the scripture verse that would tell us
[1:19:20] that there is therefore now no
[1:19:24] condemnation
[1:19:26] can you feel those expressions of life
[1:19:30] in your being from the word of God
[1:19:32] this is not me speaking an emotional
[1:19:35] thought to you this morning this is the
[1:19:36] word of God speaking from my lips down
[1:19:39] to the very depths of your soul there is
[1:19:42] that for now no condemnation
[1:19:46] to them that are in Christ Jesus
[1:19:50] who walk not after this flesh but after
[1:19:53] the spirit you're longing Lord Jesus
[1:19:56] reveal more I'm after your spirit Lord
[1:20:02] Heavenly Father then begins to give us
[1:20:05] eyes of Revelation to see and ears to
[1:20:09] hear what the spirit is saying in this
[1:20:12] time in the season
[1:20:14] when I listen to The Prophet's message
[1:20:16] I'm hearing the voice of God speaking to
[1:20:19] me personally it might be the voice of
[1:20:22] William Branham but there's a voice
[1:20:24] behind the voice and that voice is
[1:20:27] speaking to the depths of my soul saying
[1:20:30] to me if we can hear his voice and not
[1:20:33] Harden our hearts
[1:20:37] we can be a functioning people
[1:20:42] and Christ revealed in his word in 65.
[1:20:46] in the last days
[1:20:49] when the evening light brings begins to
[1:20:52] shine eyes will begin become open
[1:20:57] stop there just for a moment because I'm
[1:20:59] seeing people
[1:21:01] in this assembly today
[1:21:03] at a time of evening light
[1:21:06] neither light or nor Darkness a time
[1:21:09] where it's hazy mistake
[1:21:12] there is a people that have eyes to see
[1:21:17] when the prophet of God was drawing
[1:21:19] those moons
[1:21:21] and he was keeping the light for every
[1:21:22] age and the angel of the Lord spoke to
[1:21:25] him and he was telling him to draw this
[1:21:27] Aegis total darkness
[1:21:29] the prophet of God saw you and I in this
[1:21:33] time with that word and tucked in our
[1:21:35] hearts that were functional Believers
[1:21:37] functional bride and he said I drew a
[1:21:41] little bit of light I put a little light
[1:21:43] in there because there was a bride for a
[1:21:45] season in a time where it would be
[1:21:48] neither not neither dark nor light that
[1:21:51] there would be a people that would have
[1:21:53] eyes that become open
[1:21:56] and you will see where you're going
[1:22:00] then the body is already formed standing
[1:22:02] upon its feet taking motion
[1:22:06] now as you can see my thoughts this
[1:22:09] morning about a a functional bride a
[1:22:11] moving bride
[1:22:13] I believe God wants us to have that
[1:22:15] understanding today that we are to take
[1:22:18] motion
[1:22:20] we are to begin to move by the spirit of
[1:22:23] God
[1:22:24] now the spirit of God has always been
[1:22:26] moving but God is reaffirming to us take
[1:22:29] another step
[1:22:33] we build the fire of the prophet of God
[1:22:34] says here today but don't live on the
[1:22:37] old fire let's move up the road and
[1:22:40] build another fire
[1:22:42] and so we need to take motion moving by
[1:22:46] the Holy Spirit the same one that moved
[1:22:49] upon the prophets and wrote the Bible
[1:22:52] the same holy ghost moving in the body
[1:22:55] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:22:58] moved in the Holy Ghost out of every
[1:23:01] organization organized out of every
[1:23:03] organization every Kindred tongue and
[1:23:07] people
[1:23:09] so we are a people that is formed
[1:23:12] we are a people that is filled
[1:23:15] and we must
[1:23:17] be a functioning people
[1:23:20] let me just continue for just a few
[1:23:22] minutes on being formed
[1:23:25] I I you know you know God sometimes when
[1:23:28] you're reading his word he you know he
[1:23:31] illuminates certain words out of the
[1:23:34] scripture how many can say they've
[1:23:35] noticed that in their own lives
[1:23:37] you know you can read the message that's
[1:23:39] why the message
[1:23:40] a Malachi 4 never gets tiring because
[1:23:44] God keeps on opening and revealing more
[1:23:46] each time
[1:23:47] as you read the scripture the same God
[1:23:50] begins to show you a word and inspires
[1:23:52] your heart maybe to look that word up in
[1:23:54] the natural man's dictionary to find the
[1:23:57] meaning of the English word and it
[1:23:58] illuminates
[1:24:01] and so in Genesis chapter 1
[1:24:04] we notice and I'll just be paraphrasing
[1:24:07] but in Genesis chapter 1 we read and God
[1:24:10] said let there be light and there was
[1:24:13] light
[1:24:15] verse 6 would say God said let there be
[1:24:18] firm in it
[1:24:19] in 9 verse 9 and God said that the
[1:24:22] waters and in verse 11 God said that the
[1:24:25] Earth bring forth grass and herbs
[1:24:28] the repetitive versing here is and God
[1:24:32] said
[1:24:34] and God said
[1:24:36] and it's something that is very
[1:24:38] noticeable to me that Moses under the
[1:24:41] inspiration is writing this as he's
[1:24:43] seeing what God has done and God said
[1:24:45] and God said and when God speaks
[1:24:49] something has to happen
[1:24:54] but now I want to draw your attention to
[1:24:57] our opening scripture
[1:24:59] and it says here and the Lord God formed
[1:25:01] man of the Dust of the ground
[1:25:06] it eliminated it excited my heart
[1:25:08] because it didn't say God said that
[1:25:10] there be man except for the first
[1:25:12] spiritual man
[1:25:15] but now I see something here that struck
[1:25:18] my heart that this time God himself the
[1:25:22] scripture says he formed Man Out of the
[1:25:27] Dust of the grout
[1:25:29] the same way as he's formed the body of
[1:25:32] Jesus Christ which we all are part of
[1:25:36] and are made in particular ways
[1:25:40] and God takes man and he forms
[1:25:43] and and God he takes the time to touch
[1:25:48] he is that great high priest that can be
[1:25:50] touched
[1:25:51] by the feelings of our infirmities
[1:25:54] the songwriter would pin it down like
[1:25:57] this and we sing it many times he
[1:25:59] touched me
[1:26:01] oh he touched me
[1:26:04] how many knows hello what a joy that
[1:26:08] floods my soul
[1:26:11] something
[1:26:12] happened do you remember that day when
[1:26:16] the tender and the Jehovah touched you
[1:26:20] he personally put his hands on your 16
[1:26:23] elements
[1:26:24] and he touched his Earthly life tenderly
[1:26:28] for God is a gentleman he's not pushy
[1:26:31] he's not rough he's he's tender
[1:26:35] and he grabbed a hold of you and formed
[1:26:38] you into His Image he touched you
[1:26:43] I want to show you for a moment the
[1:26:45] tender hand of God
[1:26:47] Adam
[1:26:50] first creation
[1:26:52] placed upon this earth created upon this
[1:26:54] Earth
[1:26:56] with one
[1:26:58] which with one law so to speak do not
[1:27:01] eat of that tree and that day you eat of
[1:27:03] it you shall die
[1:27:06] and when Adam and his helpmate they
[1:27:09] found themselves in Fault
[1:27:11] and God Came From Heaven you remember
[1:27:14] the scriptures God came and he began to
[1:27:17] cry out
[1:27:20] Adam where are you
[1:27:23] I want you to notice that God didn't
[1:27:25] lose them
[1:27:27] I want you to notice that God because
[1:27:28] even though they were hiding behind
[1:27:30] their their own little formalism and
[1:27:32] their own little doctrines and
[1:27:34] denominations fig leaves I want you to
[1:27:37] notice that God never had lost them but
[1:27:40] there was a cry from the merciful god
[1:27:43] the creator of Life Adam why did you
[1:27:45] disobey
[1:27:49] fallen from fellowship you and I
[1:27:54] but God never threw the Clay Away
[1:27:57] his law was ever true
[1:27:59] the day they ate of that tree the day
[1:28:01] they shall die and they lived short of
[1:28:04] one day but I want to tell you friends
[1:28:05] the almighty God in his tenderness
[1:28:08] already went forth fulfilling or making
[1:28:10] forth a plan
[1:28:13] we find in Genesis chapter 3 he would be
[1:28:16] the woman's seed that would bruise the
[1:28:19] head of the serpent Isaiah the blushing
[1:28:21] Prophet would say a virgin shall
[1:28:24] conceive if we can grasp hold of that
[1:28:28] Grace this morning and begin to walk God
[1:28:31] will show us where we belong in his
[1:28:33] predestinated promise
[1:28:36] for this hour calling us bride
[1:28:38] so that we would walk and be functional
[1:28:42] so I want to tell you we were all marred
[1:28:45] we are all born in sin shaped in
[1:28:47] iniquity we were as unclean of a vessel
[1:28:50] as that woman caught in adultery
[1:28:53] there was many accusation against you in
[1:28:57] fact Satan comes and he gives accusation
[1:28:59] before God he's an accuser of the
[1:29:02] brethren and he brings it before God and
[1:29:05] he brings it before you
[1:29:09] how many this morning even this week
[1:29:11] could say how many times you heard that
[1:29:13] little voice of the enemy in your head
[1:29:15] bringing accusations
[1:29:17] trying to accuse you
[1:29:19] and though the accusations are great
[1:29:23] I want to tell us this morning once
[1:29:25] again to lift up scripture I make it
[1:29:28] alive this morning we are thankful for
[1:29:30] the blood
[1:29:31] [Applause]
[1:29:33] we are thankful for the power
[1:29:36] it's not just the life of a bull and
[1:29:38] goat this morning that covers your sin
[1:29:40] but it is a life within the blood the
[1:29:44] life of God that transforms you anew
[1:29:51] I'm thankful for the buffer
[1:29:54] and thank you for the thank you Lord for
[1:29:56] that blood buffer and thank you Lord for
[1:29:58] the mercy that is spoken it is finished
[1:30:01] I paid the price neither I knew I
[1:30:04] condemn you go and sit in the mark
[1:30:07] you were once in that muck of that
[1:30:10] barnyard but one day the the master came
[1:30:13] one day his brother Brandon would say
[1:30:14] the farmer would come and take you out
[1:30:17] of that Mark
[1:30:19] and begin to wash your vessel anew
[1:30:23] and question the answers
[1:30:25] 54 brother Branham said it's like a
[1:30:27] little glass here I'd show you what here
[1:30:29] for an instance like this bottle here
[1:30:34] if it was empty and I I picked it up and
[1:30:36] it was just as dirty as it could be I
[1:30:40] wanted to use as well now the first
[1:30:42] thing I'd want to is justification I I
[1:30:46] pick it up it up because I want to use
[1:30:49] it it's dirty I found it out in the pig
[1:30:52] in the pig pen or wherever it was and
[1:30:56] now I'm right
[1:30:57] I'm the right kind of person well I
[1:31:00] don't want to put something clean in
[1:31:02] there I'm going to have to use it
[1:31:05] I'd have to fix it up first
[1:31:08] and the best thing to do is scour it
[1:31:14] first thing to do is scour it clean it
[1:31:16] and sanctify it is that right
[1:31:20] now what does the word sanctify me
[1:31:22] cleaned and set aside for service
[1:31:26] The Vessel of the old Temple were
[1:31:30] cleaned and set aside for service
[1:31:34] but I I don't want to get just caught up
[1:31:36] on the clean
[1:31:38] I don't want to just caught up on the
[1:31:40] regulations
[1:31:42] I don't want to just try to preach a
[1:31:44] legalistic word although we need to live
[1:31:47] righteous
[1:31:48] I want to slook it this morning a
[1:31:51] product of service
[1:31:54] of people that can be used by God
[1:31:57] a people now that has the Breath of Life
[1:32:02] blown into their nostrils
[1:32:07] question and answers again brother Brian
[1:32:09] would see I see Adam standing
[1:32:12] taking this way and see him standing
[1:32:14] like a tree
[1:32:16] God had made him he was dead as he could
[1:32:20] be his toes like roots
[1:32:23] sticking in the ground
[1:32:25] and God said let therapy or breathe the
[1:32:27] breadth of life into him and he jumps
[1:32:32] he became he he came to himself he
[1:32:36] breathed the breath of life into him and
[1:32:39] became a living soul
[1:32:43] now he begins to move on
[1:32:47] and move on
[1:32:49] we're talking like a locomotive moving
[1:32:52] on with the spirit of God in his very
[1:32:56] being within his within his body
[1:33:00] it was God's very own life that was
[1:33:02] breathed into Adam's nostrils
[1:33:06] I would say today is a prayer to my
[1:33:09] heart the Lord hearing here even this
[1:33:11] morning because he's here
[1:33:12] I would say Lord Breathe on Me
[1:33:17] maybe some of you have never received
[1:33:19] the Breath of Life you 've gone to a
[1:33:21] church for many years but never received
[1:33:23] the Breath of Life
[1:33:25] I would compel you with all my heart in
[1:33:27] this portion of my thought towards you
[1:33:30] allow God to scour out your old nature
[1:33:34] Hallelujah let him breathe into you his
[1:33:37] life
[1:33:41] let him breathe on you this day to
[1:33:43] receive this life
[1:33:46] and those of us who met the pillar of
[1:33:48] fire maybe some time ago
[1:33:50] I would say to us Empty Out Your Vessel
[1:33:53] that he can come and fill it again
[1:33:55] every time we come to him say Lord
[1:33:58] Bridge your life and me when I'm walking
[1:34:01] let it be you walk when the people see
[1:34:04] me they see a mere image of you Lord may
[1:34:07] it be the life of God
[1:34:09] that would Breathe us in our beings
[1:34:12] what is this Breath of Life it's God's
[1:34:14] very own life as we would say Joey lies
[1:34:17] God filling containers God filling
[1:34:21] vessels lives that can be used and can
[1:34:24] be functional for his glory
[1:34:28] we desire to come into the statue of a
[1:34:30] perfect man
[1:34:32] these words these thoughts that I'm
[1:34:35] bringing to you this morning your mature
[1:34:37] Believers eating the meat of the word
[1:34:39] you know and have many had many servants
[1:34:42] preached to you on the Statue of a
[1:34:45] perfect man
[1:34:46] and we read there as Peter would begin
[1:34:48] to speak he would say having the divine
[1:34:50] nature get the Breath of Life get the
[1:34:53] spirit of God into you and then in your
[1:34:55] life you will be added unto you
[1:34:58] but I want you to see today in from my
[1:35:02] heart that this is not a seven step
[1:35:04] program
[1:35:06] this is not a program once you've
[1:35:08] mastered faith you'll get to go all the
[1:35:11] way to virtue you're not gaining gold
[1:35:14] coins this morning for jumping a level
[1:35:17] but I want to assure you that as you
[1:35:20] were born by the one Spirit which is
[1:35:23] Christ as you were born in that spirit
[1:35:26] all the nature of God
[1:35:29] was placed into your big
[1:35:32] brother Brandon would say it like this
[1:35:34] like I oak acorn all of the
[1:35:37] characteristics all the nature of the
[1:35:39] great big old tree he's in that little
[1:35:42] acorn
[1:35:43] it's hard to see it's not in
[1:35:45] manifestation but place it in the ground
[1:35:48] Hallelujah put it in there and water it
[1:35:52] and let the soul and shine upon it and
[1:35:55] precipitation all that was within the
[1:35:58] acorn begins to grow
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:06] you have faith
[1:36:08] you have virtue
[1:36:10] you have guminous preduminous power
[1:36:13] listen
[1:36:14] we don't need to always call the pastor
[1:36:17] at three in the morning and say my child
[1:36:19] is sick can you pray
[1:36:21] you have the life of God
[1:36:24] [Applause]
[1:36:25] in your being and fathers can come and
[1:36:28] lay their hands on their children
[1:36:32] mothers maybe father's not home and she
[1:36:36] calls to God I need some help my baby's
[1:36:40] fevering looks like they're unto death
[1:36:43] God help
[1:36:46] and he's a ever-present help in the time
[1:36:49] of trouble
[1:36:51] you see we have the nature of these
[1:36:54] Natures of God we do have a Godly love
[1:36:58] on the inside of us
[1:37:00] and I say to us this morning God help us
[1:37:03] to allow that to be functional to come
[1:37:06] in fruition to come into a place where
[1:37:09] we can recognize that we have this love
[1:37:12] of God
[1:37:16] First Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 1.
[1:37:21] though I speak
[1:37:23] with tongues of men and angels and have
[1:37:27] not charity
[1:37:28] have become as a sounding brass
[1:37:33] or a tingling symbol
[1:37:37] though I can do all things
[1:37:40] though I have the gift of Prophecy and
[1:37:43] understand all Mysteries
[1:37:46] friends the Mysteries are open before us
[1:37:49] we believe that we believe the seventh
[1:37:52] seal is open I believe it
[1:37:54] we don't know the time of the hour he
[1:37:55] shall come but the seal is open
[1:37:59] we could see in the prophet of protest
[1:38:01] the interpretation of the white horse
[1:38:03] riding deceiving the people we've seen
[1:38:06] plagues and see Wars we see him at time
[1:38:09] as we live in now where it's all missed
[1:38:11] together much together and it's a pale
[1:38:14] horse riding
[1:38:16] but there is a bride that can see past
[1:38:19] all of that why because she's
[1:38:21] functioning by elgapi love
[1:38:25] we want to know how do we move
[1:38:28] how do we operate
[1:38:30] how do I how does our locomotive get
[1:38:33] forth enough steam the force to go
[1:38:35] through it's the oh God Be Love of God
[1:38:38] that moves us
[1:38:41] though we have a gift of Prophecy or
[1:38:43] understand all the Mysteries and all the
[1:38:45] knowledge and though I have faith to to
[1:38:48] so and I could remove mountains and have
[1:38:53] not charity I am nothing
[1:38:57] that sounds pretty powerful
[1:38:59] I don't know about you but you know I'd
[1:39:02] like to move a mountain sometime
[1:39:05] right on in my natural stuff oh that
[1:39:07] would be amazing but friends
[1:39:10] there are mountains in our way that we
[1:39:12] cannot see
[1:39:14] their struggles we call them the
[1:39:16] goliaths whatever they may be in your
[1:39:18] path and the only way to get them out of
[1:39:21] your life is to love them
[1:39:27] remember the time brother Branham he
[1:39:28] addressed that man that he kept praying
[1:39:31] for his wife and casting the devil off
[1:39:32] his wife
[1:39:34] he'd hold her and pray in the name of
[1:39:35] Jesus Satan you leave Satan Satan
[1:39:38] brother Brown gave us advice he said why
[1:39:40] don't you just love the woman
[1:39:44] why don't you let love project
[1:39:47] he said brother Steve love function of
[1:39:49] the Bride yes there is a first fruit in
[1:39:51] our generation that's the prophet of God
[1:39:53] what we would see him he would have so
[1:39:56] much love in his heart that he'd come
[1:39:57] across a bull
[1:40:01] and the natural man was just like all of
[1:40:04] us
[1:40:04] he went to reach for his gun he was a
[1:40:07] hunter that's his first desire was to
[1:40:09] treat it the hunting way
[1:40:12] but then something overwhelmed him and
[1:40:15] he said I wish this would happen all the
[1:40:18] time what was it love projecting love
[1:40:23] projecting he wasn't just merely
[1:40:25] understanding a mystery
[1:40:28] or hitting a symbol
[1:40:30] or having some wonderful move that we
[1:40:33] would call of God it would take the
[1:40:36] projection of love
[1:40:39] and not just feel your love because feel
[1:40:42] your life can turn into hate in a moment
[1:40:44] put out God Be Loved God's very own love
[1:40:48] like he loved us from the beginning God
[1:40:51] brings forth functionality inside of our
[1:40:55] lives
[1:40:57] when we speak now to be in the image of
[1:41:00] God and form filled and malfunctioning
[1:41:02] we'll look back for just a moment at
[1:41:04] Adam when he was given the creation of
[1:41:07] the garden
[1:41:08] he was given full Dominion
[1:41:12] over the Earth
[1:41:15] we see in our generation a Son of God
[1:41:19] taking Dominion
[1:41:22] and I want you to see this for just a
[1:41:24] moment because many times people put
[1:41:27] this on the prophet's ministry as a word
[1:41:29] prophet
[1:41:31] but I wanted to tell us this morning
[1:41:33] from my heart that every son and God but
[1:41:36] daughter of God must receive the Breath
[1:41:38] of Life
[1:41:39] and the prophet of God himself needed to
[1:41:42] receive the Holy Ghost so this was a Son
[1:41:46] of God operating in Dominion
[1:41:50] and he would begin to speak and and as
[1:41:53] he would speak the weather situation
[1:41:55] changes
[1:41:58] as loud Gopi Love Is Spoken as I said uh
[1:42:02] bulls or Hornets begin to hear the voice
[1:42:04] of God
[1:42:06] animal life begins to bring come forth
[1:42:09] in the existence
[1:42:12] and in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:42:15] the message and from the church age book
[1:42:17] The Prophet will say right now we reign
[1:42:19] with Christ
[1:42:23] having dominion over sin
[1:42:26] this is
[1:42:27] The Possession The Inheritance
[1:42:30] of a son and daughter of God filled with
[1:42:33] the Breath of Life
[1:42:35] this is not just a word prophet's
[1:42:37] Ministry
[1:42:38] this is now we reign with Christ having
[1:42:41] dominion over sin the World the Flesh
[1:42:44] and the devil showing forth his praises
[1:42:47] and Glory show him forth himself
[1:42:50] for it is Christ in US willing and doing
[1:42:54] of the good pleasure
[1:42:58] and they how the angel came to me
[1:43:01] and now is your servant
[1:43:04] I take dominion over every unclean
[1:43:08] spirit in this building
[1:43:11] this is the son of God
[1:43:15] I want you to notice this son of God use
[1:43:18] the spoken word
[1:43:21] he began to speak I take dominion over
[1:43:24] every clear unclean on spirit
[1:43:28] what about your hopes
[1:43:31] your teenager maybe walks into the house
[1:43:35] maybe they had been on Satan's ground
[1:43:37] and brought a little life that's not of
[1:43:39] Christ
[1:43:40] and there's her mother and father that
[1:43:43] have taken dominion over their homes by
[1:43:46] the word of God
[1:43:48] and they can see a spirit coming to your
[1:43:51] home and they see it and they say as the
[1:43:54] prophet of God has said here I take
[1:43:56] every unclean spirit
[1:44:01] I don't have any Dominion in the bar
[1:44:04] come on I don't have any Dominion in the
[1:44:07] places where Satan roams and walks but
[1:44:10] in this home
[1:44:14] where the blood is applied
[1:44:16] I take dominion over every Spirit every
[1:44:19] fowl of the air every atmosphere every
[1:44:22] principality of power I take control of
[1:44:25] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:44:28] when you walk into the house of God
[1:44:31] your pastor come and begins to preach
[1:44:33] the word of God and the word begins to
[1:44:36] speak it's the Dominion of the Holy
[1:44:37] Spirit beginning to take control and
[1:44:40] begin to discern your hearts right here
[1:44:42] in the meeting
[1:44:43] we may not have that Ministry of the
[1:44:46] Prophet to stand here and tell you your
[1:44:48] name and where you came from but when
[1:44:50] the Holy Spirit comes in a mighty way
[1:44:52] and begins to anoint from the office all
[1:44:55] the way adhere to the to the desk and it
[1:44:57] begins to speak Words of Life to you I
[1:45:00] want you know friends it's God so
[1:45:02] opening up Discerning your heart God
[1:45:04] taking Dominion
[1:45:08] in the house of God
[1:45:10] brother Brown continues and I say to
[1:45:12] Satan
[1:45:13] you're a loser
[1:45:15] can you say loser
[1:45:18] one more time Satan you're a loser
[1:45:21] God has sent Christ and he's won the
[1:45:25] victory
[1:45:26] and I charge thee by Jesus Christ the
[1:45:30] son of God to come out of the people
[1:45:34] functioning having Dominion Dominion to
[1:45:38] become Sons and Daughters of God meaning
[1:45:40] that we have today in our hands
[1:45:45] the king's heart
[1:45:48] it was in the hand of the prophet
[1:45:51] but I want you to notice it's been
[1:45:53] transferred down to a bride
[1:45:55] she has the king's sword she has that
[1:45:58] third pole Ministry I'll meet you in
[1:46:01] there
[1:46:02] I'll give you the word
[1:46:04] I'll meet you in that wooden box behind
[1:46:07] the veil I'll meet you there
[1:46:09] that's what God has done in each ever
[1:46:11] one of our lives
[1:46:13] wood means to be a humanity and he's met
[1:46:15] us right in our very beings
[1:46:19] right in our souls
[1:46:21] I want to make these statements like the
[1:46:24] mantle of Elijah is now on the shoulders
[1:46:27] of Elijah
[1:46:29] and we believe in a bride's Ministry
[1:46:32] in Elisha Ministry a bride coming into
[1:46:34] her position a bride that is functioning
[1:46:37] she's anointed for such a time as this
[1:46:41] I'd say to the Believers this morning
[1:46:44] we can Shout with the top of our lungs
[1:46:46] we can arise
[1:46:50] we're arising and Shining for our light
[1:46:53] has come we've received it we believe
[1:46:55] we're a functional bride
[1:46:59] oh the king soared in our hands are you
[1:47:03] with me this morning
[1:47:05] are we are we together
[1:47:08] she's got the word in her hands
[1:47:11] and our seed shall possess the Gate of
[1:47:14] the enemy
[1:47:16] we're not supposed to cry
[1:47:19] we're supposed to speak the word of God
[1:47:23] for we know behold greater is Solomon is
[1:47:26] here
[1:47:27] this is causing us to be functional
[1:47:31] we can say this day we're living in a
[1:47:34] day of Promise in a rapturing cycle we
[1:47:37] can say this day this scripture is
[1:47:39] fulfilled
[1:47:41] brother Brandon would speak these words
[1:47:43] believe us now this believe us now this
[1:47:47] God being made flesh
[1:47:49] right amongst his people
[1:47:53] now if it's okay I just want to move a
[1:47:56] little farther
[1:47:58] we often speak of these words mechanics
[1:48:01] and Dynamics and how many knows are
[1:48:03] familiar with those words
[1:48:06] and brother Brandon would say looking
[1:48:08] unto Jesus he say mechanics isn't what
[1:48:11] runs the automobile
[1:48:13] it's the Dynamics that runs it
[1:48:17] the mechanics don't run the church it's
[1:48:20] the Dynamics
[1:48:21] the holy ghost that gets into the word
[1:48:25] may I repeat that
[1:48:28] it's the holy ghost that gets in this
[1:48:30] word
[1:48:31] it's not a seminary that teaches you all
[1:48:34] the Theology and Greek interpretations
[1:48:38] it's the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost in
[1:48:40] there to set a fire and to bring to pass
[1:48:43] and to make it live just exactly what
[1:48:46] the promised word is for this hour
[1:48:52] now I said to you moments ago that I was
[1:48:54] raised in the message
[1:48:57] and I've been in countless
[1:49:00] meetings just like most of you have been
[1:49:03] and I I so enjoyed when the ministry
[1:49:06] have always gotten up and they preached
[1:49:08] the word
[1:49:09] and they used the term Dynamics I kind
[1:49:13] of always like presented as an outward
[1:49:15] expression of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:18] and so sometimes we would say and and I
[1:49:21] want to be very positive I want to tell
[1:49:23] you sometimes we say that the church was
[1:49:25] you know in a season of dryness
[1:49:27] and so then we we would get up and say
[1:49:30] well praise God we need the Dynamics and
[1:49:32] yes that's true we want some power some
[1:49:34] some joy and excitement in the church
[1:49:37] we want some demonstration and
[1:49:40] so I prayed about this and I was Lord
[1:49:43] can you give me just a little bit more
[1:49:44] Vision I I like a little more Revelation
[1:49:46] if you would Lord
[1:49:50] I want this word to live in me
[1:49:53] you see I I I want to praise God on
[1:49:55] Sunday and Wednesday and youth meeting
[1:49:58] in camps and I want
[1:50:00] I I really want to
[1:50:02] hello brother I love the Lord with all
[1:50:04] my heart
[1:50:06] I've given my entire life to the Lord
[1:50:09] but Monday
[1:50:12] I I want to live
[1:50:16] I want to function
[1:50:19] I want to go out to my job
[1:50:21] and I don't want them to see the natural
[1:50:24] Steve Clark
[1:50:27] I want the Holy Ghost by the word of God
[1:50:30] to be seen in me to live
[1:50:34] I want it to be that when I hit my
[1:50:36] finger with a hammer
[1:50:39] that out of my lips come forth the glory
[1:50:42] of God in the time of misery
[1:50:50] is this okay
[1:50:52] okay
[1:50:55] praise the name of the Lord I've hit my
[1:50:56] fingers so many times
[1:50:59] I was putting some fans it's really hot
[1:51:01] where we are too not like here but it's
[1:51:03] hot
[1:51:04] when we don't have any air conditioning
[1:51:06] in the church it's just a new little
[1:51:07] church that we've been renting and I was
[1:51:09] putting up some fans and
[1:51:10] praise the Lord
[1:51:12] I was so thankful that I had the word in
[1:51:15] my life
[1:51:17] I've never been suited to be electrician
[1:51:22] God bless the electricians in the house
[1:51:24] this morning
[1:51:26] God's given you patience like job
[1:51:30] and the spark of joy
[1:51:36] but I looked into Webster's Dictionary
[1:51:38] just to kind of get some clarity for
[1:51:40] myself
[1:51:42] when I noticed the meaning
[1:51:44] there's three and I'll bring them to you
[1:51:45] like this there's a physics
[1:51:48] perception of the meaning
[1:51:52] Dynamics
[1:51:54] it's a branch of mechanics that deals
[1:51:57] with Force
[1:51:59] and the relation primary to motion
[1:52:02] by sometimes also to the equilibrium of
[1:52:05] bodies
[1:52:07] now I'm not an engineer and I
[1:52:10] the Lord called me to be a preacher
[1:52:14] but I looked up this word also
[1:52:17] this equilibrium of bodies
[1:52:20] and it's when all forces that act upon
[1:52:23] the object are balanced
[1:52:26] then the odd shift is said to be in the
[1:52:29] state of equilibrium
[1:52:31] so we want to have a dynamic that is in
[1:52:35] motion it's like gas for the for the
[1:52:38] automobile
[1:52:40] that has some stimulation and some spark
[1:52:43] some movement but behind that movement
[1:52:46] every part of that movement has to be
[1:52:49] balanced
[1:52:53] brother Brandon would say you can't go
[1:52:55] to the left
[1:52:57] and you can't go to the right
[1:52:59] a Believer stays in the middle of the
[1:53:02] road
[1:53:06] we want to have balance for sons of God
[1:53:08] moving
[1:53:10] with power like I said moments ago a
[1:53:12] locomotive living and working and
[1:53:15] breathing in everyday lives in the
[1:53:19] balance of Jesus Christ people so
[1:53:22] balanced in the word that their motion
[1:53:25] is not this way or that way it's up
[1:53:31] we would all agree
[1:53:33] that the world is sin sick
[1:53:36] there's a disease in the lounge
[1:53:39] and there's diseases that
[1:53:42] spiritually now that are more continuous
[1:53:45] than contagious than any virus that
[1:53:48] could key on this planet sin is so
[1:53:50] contagious
[1:53:52] it is so contagious that if you don't
[1:53:54] get the Holy Ghost young people rock and
[1:53:57] roll will get you
[1:54:00] things on the internet will get you
[1:54:03] Fashions will get you
[1:54:06] so we need to be a people that recognize
[1:54:09] that there's disease in the land and we
[1:54:12] need the dynamic of God the balance of
[1:54:14] God to heal all our diseases
[1:54:18] so I was once again praying Lord can I
[1:54:21] how can I bring this to the people
[1:54:23] that I would be balanced in your word
[1:54:25] Lord
[1:54:27] brother Adam
[1:54:28] this was brought to my attention by the
[1:54:30] Lord I believe in the message why
[1:54:32] brother Brown begins to speak about
[1:54:34] doctors medicine
[1:54:36] and he calls it a toxin and he would say
[1:54:39] and now does a doctor ever get a whole
[1:54:41] how does a doctor ever get a hold of
[1:54:43] medicines anyhow
[1:54:44] do you even do it and you know what they
[1:54:47] do they put a lot of stuff together
[1:54:50] I'm not interested in stuff
[1:54:54] I don't come to church and hear my
[1:54:56] pastor preach stuff
[1:55:00] you want stuff we can get it out there
[1:55:02] getting stuff
[1:55:05] but we come here to become a bride
[1:55:09] to to be caught up in a moment to
[1:55:13] tweaking him out not to be left here I
[1:55:15] have no intentions on seeing Moses and
[1:55:18] Elijah
[1:55:19] I know they're coming but if any of us
[1:55:21] see Moses and Elijah friends we've
[1:55:24] missed it
[1:55:30] and so brother Brandon would begin to
[1:55:32] talk about sickness and he'll talk about
[1:55:33] that toxin he said well
[1:55:35] he would talk about that stuff
[1:55:38] some poison and then some antidote mix
[1:55:42] it till they mix up a formula
[1:55:45] then he says these words too much poison
[1:55:48] will kill you
[1:55:52] and too much antidote
[1:55:54] would do you would I wouldn't do you any
[1:55:57] good
[1:55:59] the medicine wouldn't it's got to be
[1:56:01] balanced formula
[1:56:07] so medicine is powerful
[1:56:10] it's a force
[1:56:12] it helps your body all those little
[1:56:14] white blood cells in our little army
[1:56:17] little guys that are fighting against
[1:56:19] the disease
[1:56:20] when you put some medicine inside it
[1:56:23] helps them win the battle
[1:56:27] we need to put some balanced diets in
[1:56:29] our bodies
[1:56:31] in the body of Christ a dynamic
[1:56:34] the the next part of the definition
[1:56:36] would begin to say Dynamics which is a
[1:56:40] pattern or a process of change
[1:56:43] growth or activity
[1:56:47] now when you think of a tender little
[1:56:49] plant and you put in a seed in you begin
[1:56:51] to water it I want you to notice that
[1:56:53] from a Little Seedling all the way to a
[1:56:56] mature plant it takes growing
[1:56:58] and that is a dynamic it's the vibration
[1:57:01] of cells vibration it drinks in and
[1:57:05] pushes out drinks in and pushes out
[1:57:08] anybody hear that familiar of saying the
[1:57:11] prophet would say drink in push out
[1:57:13] drink in push out let the light of God
[1:57:17] the son shine upon you this is ripening
[1:57:20] season this is the time
[1:57:25] and it vibrates
[1:57:27] it changes you daily
[1:57:30] you can't stay what you were yesterday
[1:57:33] you've got to eat the word I encourage
[1:57:36] you daily to eat the word read and
[1:57:39] meditate upon it pray you can't pray too
[1:57:42] much find God on your Niche you need
[1:57:45] purpose Lord what part do I play in the
[1:57:47] body find them on your knees
[1:57:52] day by day as you eat the word of God
[1:57:54] you'll become part of the original
[1:57:57] you're not going to be a a hybrid plant
[1:58:00] that you have to baby and spray and
[1:58:04] knock the worms off no our original
[1:58:06] Plants got strengthen it it can grow it
[1:58:09] can live under the most darkest
[1:58:11] circumstance that's why God placed you
[1:58:14] in this hour in leadership in a time
[1:58:18] where there's a greatest battle ever
[1:58:19] fought in the mind God placed you the
[1:58:22] part of the Bride to be at this age
[1:58:27] there's another definition which I
[1:58:29] really like
[1:58:31] the definition would be the variation
[1:58:33] this is of Dynamics the variation and
[1:58:36] contrast in force or intensity which has
[1:58:39] to do with music
[1:58:42] there you know we have some beautiful
[1:58:43] man you guys got good musicians
[1:58:47] but you know if they would not play with
[1:58:49] a dynamic
[1:58:51] we would say well maybe they just got to
[1:58:53] go back and learn a little
[1:58:55] but every musician knows that there's
[1:58:58] got to be some variation there's got to
[1:59:00] be some dynamic
[1:59:02] there's got to be some color
[1:59:07] we can't just be grouchy to all the
[1:59:08] people all the time go to church grouchy
[1:59:10] grouchy
[1:59:12] I know we let you all live in the desert
[1:59:14] you know where the leaves turn in and
[1:59:15] they become stickers but not in the
[1:59:17] house of God there's color
[1:59:20] there's expression of joy
[1:59:24] your life is a Sound of Music
[1:59:33] the dynamic is the action within the
[1:59:35] music the dynamic is the pulsation in
[1:59:38] the music
[1:59:40] looking unto Jesus
[1:59:42] and I think that the Holy Spirit can
[1:59:44] lead man and tell him things and make
[1:59:47] him act different
[1:59:49] and make him believe things and receive
[1:59:51] things that this world never could
[1:59:54] believe could happen
[1:59:57] next slide would say
[2:00:00] oh if you'll put up just put on that
[2:00:03] little video oh can't you feel that
[2:00:05] pulsation
[2:00:08] of the spirit begin to rise in your
[2:00:11] heart
[2:00:12] Saint Jesus is in our midst
[2:00:15] whatever two or three are gathered in my
[2:00:17] name I will be in their midst pulsation
[2:00:20] something moving like a heartbeat it's
[2:00:24] pumping energy in your spirit it's
[2:00:27] pumping energy in your mind
[2:00:29] then let the things that your eyes see
[2:00:32] black out
[2:00:33] then you see not the things of the world
[2:00:37] you're believing What God Says
[2:00:41] it's a pulsation of a faith
[2:00:44] it's a normal heartbeat
[2:00:48] I like normal
[2:00:51] you know some people are all about
[2:00:52] excitement I like normal
[2:00:55] 60 beats per minute I like that
[2:00:57] heartbeat
[2:00:59] 60b per minute now I want to tell you if
[2:01:02] your heart on a regular basis runs at
[2:01:05] 120 beats per minute you're going to
[2:01:07] have troubles
[2:01:11] you can't last
[2:01:15] on a hundred and beats per minute
[2:01:18] we need to have Believers that are
[2:01:21] forward marching with a steady pulsation
[2:01:23] of the world word bringing about
[2:01:26] rapturing faith
[2:01:30] the scripture says Abraham's tiger not
[2:01:33] at the promises of God
[2:01:39] Abraham house is going to happen well
[2:01:42] sir it's going to happen let's just be
[2:01:45] steady
[2:01:46] yeah
[2:01:47] it's gonna happen well Sarah says why
[2:01:50] don't you go into Hagar
[2:01:52] and take her pretty soon Abraham's heart
[2:01:54] went up to 102 20 beats per second and
[2:01:58] pretty soon we're still living with the
[2:02:00] disaster
[2:02:03] hey Abraham realize you gotta stay with
[2:02:06] the word I gotta say what he said I
[2:02:08] gotta walk as he's walked and once again
[2:02:11] he went back to 60 beats per minute
[2:02:14] staggering on at the promises of God
[2:02:17] Abraham have got some boots and they're
[2:02:21] all being knit because our promised son
[2:02:23] is coming good Sarah we're just not
[2:02:26] gonna you know worry we're gonna just
[2:02:28] keep on marching how is there going to
[2:02:31] be Rapture I don't know but it's going
[2:02:33] to happen
[2:02:36] but I'd like it to make it happen no I'm
[2:02:39] not going to make it happen
[2:02:42] we're just gonna March preach the word
[2:02:45] Noah preached the word 120 years
[2:02:49] how can you preach the same message over
[2:02:52] and over again it's going to rain
[2:02:55] well maybe I said well you know I was
[2:02:57] building today on the starboard side and
[2:02:59] we had a good time but it's gonna rain
[2:03:02] you know I was out and we were walking
[2:03:05] and we saw some of the animals coming
[2:03:06] but it's gonna rain
[2:03:08] the message was steady
[2:03:14] we need to be people that are formed
[2:03:17] a people that's filled a people that is
[2:03:20] functioning in step in rhythm
[2:03:22] to the beat of God's heart
[2:03:25] could I draw you a moment as this is
[2:03:28] just one last example before I do close
[2:03:30] I don't want to take too much of your
[2:03:32] time
[2:03:33] but I want you to notice something in
[2:03:35] the scripture
[2:03:37] in Mark chapter 11 verse 12
[2:03:40] this is an account and I'll read it to
[2:03:42] you
[2:03:43] and on the moral
[2:03:45] when they had come from Bethany he was
[2:03:48] hungry now we're talking about Jesus he
[2:03:50] was hungry
[2:03:52] but Brandon would say he hungered like a
[2:03:54] man
[2:03:56] but when he created Fish and Loaves he
[2:03:59] was God
[2:04:02] and here Jesus he was hungry and seeing
[2:04:06] a fig tree afar off having leaves
[2:04:09] he came
[2:04:11] if happily he might find I think they're
[2:04:14] on when he come to it that he found
[2:04:16] nothing but leaps
[2:04:18] from the for the time of figs was not
[2:04:21] yet
[2:04:23] you know
[2:04:24] people from Palestine they know their
[2:04:26] trees pretty good especially figs
[2:04:28] and uh when there is an abundance of
[2:04:31] leaves that means it's the season for
[2:04:34] figs
[2:04:35] and here Jesus walks up to it thinking
[2:04:38] it's looking from afar off
[2:04:40] he looks and he thinks there is fruit
[2:04:43] there on that tree
[2:04:45] but when he arrives all there is is
[2:04:48] leaves
[2:04:50] and Jesus answers said unto him and no
[2:04:52] man eat fruit from the air after
[2:04:55] now I want you to see this it's not
[2:04:56] Jesus having a temper tantrum
[2:04:59] this is Jesus fast forwarding to 2023
[2:05:03] speaking to a people about being a
[2:05:06] functional bride
[2:05:09] so on tomorrow in the morning they
[2:05:11] passed by and they saw the fig tree
[2:05:14] dried up from its roots
[2:05:17] Peter calling to remove it saith that
[2:05:19] him Master behold the Fig Tree which
[2:05:21] thou cursed is withered away
[2:05:25] now I ask
[2:05:27] is the generality of a question to you
[2:05:29] what was wrong with the tree
[2:05:32] it had all the aspects
[2:05:36] of being a good tree
[2:05:38] now recognize when we talk about
[2:05:40] sometimes trees we talk about this being
[2:05:42] human life
[2:05:44] this was all of a tree that looked
[2:05:47] beautiful had the aspects but it wasn't
[2:05:50] functional
[2:05:52] this part of this message I like to just
[2:05:55] hone into our personal lives for just a
[2:05:57] moment
[2:05:59] and not to get too far down the road in
[2:06:01] a pastoral way but just to prick our
[2:06:03] heart just a little bit
[2:06:06] so don't worry I'm not going to go too
[2:06:08] far but I just want our hearts to be
[2:06:09] pricked for just a moment
[2:06:12] the trouble with this tree was it looked
[2:06:14] good
[2:06:15] but it wasn't functional
[2:06:17] it had all the mechanics of a good tree
[2:06:21] but it really it had no fruit
[2:06:25] we look at this tree a little closer it
[2:06:28] had good solid bark
[2:06:30] it had good solid sound doctrines good
[2:06:33] Bible teaching
[2:06:36] it had leaves that were healthy it was a
[2:06:41] tree full of Fellowship
[2:06:42] a wow that tree when the wind would
[2:06:45] begin to blow the leaves would begin to
[2:06:47] flutter
[2:06:48] Oh what a beautiful thing it is when you
[2:06:51] hear
[2:06:53] and the wind blows and this it's a
[2:06:56] beautiful a beautiful sight to hear
[2:07:00] having the right Doctrine and a good
[2:07:02] wind in the tree even those little
[2:07:05] animals like to shelter themselves under
[2:07:08] the branches of that Fellowship of the
[2:07:11] tree
[2:07:13] but Jesus walks up to that tree
[2:07:16] and he does something that nobody
[2:07:18] expects
[2:07:20] curses that tree
[2:07:22] he looks at it and says there's no life
[2:07:25] in you
[2:07:27] what use are you
[2:07:29] having all these good things of good
[2:07:32] good you know good bark and good leaps
[2:07:35] but there is no functionality to you
[2:07:39] the function of us right me you the
[2:07:43] function of us is to reproduce Jesus
[2:07:47] Christ in this hour
[2:07:52] to bring forth the word
[2:07:55] to live the word
[2:07:57] to be functioning to produce the fruit
[2:08:00] of God
[2:08:03] Oh Brother Steve huh I want to be the
[2:08:05] fruit I want to bring forth fruit how do
[2:08:07] I do it
[2:08:08] well Peter when he saw that tree wither
[2:08:11] waist he asked Jesus well what's wrong
[2:08:13] with the tree and Jesus completely
[2:08:15] ignores him
[2:08:18] what does Jesus say to him and Jesus
[2:08:20] answering saith unto him
[2:08:22] have faith in God
[2:08:29] no
[2:08:30] I'm not an interpreter but I'm my little
[2:08:33] mind that means Be steady
[2:08:38] in my little mind is just believe God in
[2:08:40] all things
[2:08:41] always believe Christ ABC's
[2:08:45] it's learning their ABCs before we get
[2:08:47] to algebra bring about the sixth sense
[2:08:50] in your life
[2:08:52] look to the Unseen
[2:08:54] speak the word and see it come to pass
[2:08:58] really believe within your being that we
[2:09:01] have returned back to any condition that
[2:09:04] I keep the fellowship with God that
[2:09:06] Fellowship on a daily basis causes us to
[2:09:09] love with agape and walk in
[2:09:11] functionality
[2:09:13] that Fellowship of God on a regular
[2:09:15] basis gives us the confidence to have
[2:09:19] dominion upon this Earth
[2:09:22] to have dominion over the powers of the
[2:09:25] air in our homes
[2:09:27] Jesus would continue and say I barely I
[2:09:30] say unto you now after he said have
[2:09:32] faith in God he says I barely I say unto
[2:09:34] you
[2:09:35] that's whosoever shall say to this
[2:09:37] mountain
[2:09:38] be thou removed and be thou cast in the
[2:09:41] sea and shall not talk in his heart but
[2:09:44] believe that those things which shall
[2:09:47] which sorry those things which he seeth
[2:09:50] shall come to pass he shall
[2:09:53] whatsoever he saith he shall have
[2:09:55] whatsoever she saith
[2:09:57] it's having that faith
[2:10:00] in the word
[2:10:03] I want us to have our hearts set upon
[2:10:05] having faith in the word this morning
[2:10:09] the word has never lost its power
[2:10:16] back home we're seeing it
[2:10:19] where we're preaching the gospel we're
[2:10:20] seeing it but
[2:10:21] the word is drawing those that have left
[2:10:23] the message a long time
[2:10:25] but by the speaking of the word
[2:10:28] they're coming home
[2:10:31] we're seeing lives that we're so messed
[2:10:32] up and
[2:10:34] one two three kids from different
[2:10:36] marriages and drugs and alcohol raise
[2:10:39] kids raised in the message fallen so far
[2:10:42] away from God
[2:10:45] mother and father says would you just
[2:10:47] come and see the new building see the
[2:10:49] new church see what's going on
[2:10:53] we stand in the pulpits and we don't
[2:10:55] know who's coming
[2:10:56] but we meet God behind the veil there in
[2:10:59] the office
[2:11:00] I want to encourage all of us to meet
[2:11:01] God on a regular basis and because for
[2:11:04] you know it God begins to speak his word
[2:11:06] through vessels of clay that desire to
[2:11:08] just be vessels of honor and by the
[2:11:11] spoken word God begins to discern arts
[2:11:14] and change lives and before you know to
[2:11:16] come to you for prayer and come
[2:11:18] repenting say Lord I want to serve you
[2:11:25] how are we going to get this tree to
[2:11:27] bring forth fruit believes in God
[2:11:31] trust in God have faith in God in our
[2:11:34] mountains shall be moved
[2:11:38] my last quotation for you this morning
[2:11:40] before we we close
[2:11:44] in the pergament church age
[2:11:47] the church age book
[2:11:49] but the brown would say like this and I
[2:11:51] believe it with all my heart and
[2:11:52] confidence
[2:11:54] the bride has the mind of Christ
[2:11:57] for she knows what he wants done with
[2:12:00] the words
[2:12:02] she performs and commands of the word in
[2:12:06] his name for she's
[2:12:08] has thus saith the Lord
[2:12:13] I want you to have confidence this
[2:12:15] morning
[2:12:17] if you would just do something foolish
[2:12:19] for me and just raise your hand say I am
[2:12:20] the bride
[2:12:23] then this quotation is for you
[2:12:27] let the faith arise in your heart
[2:12:29] the spoken word take hold
[2:12:36] she performs the commands of the word
[2:12:39] in his name for she has thus saith the
[2:12:42] Lord
[2:12:43] when the word is quickened by the spirit
[2:12:45] and it comes to pass
[2:12:47] like a seed that is planted in watered
[2:12:50] it comes to full Harvest
[2:12:53] serving its purpose
[2:12:56] those in the bride to only his will
[2:13:00] no one can make them do otherwise
[2:13:03] they have thus saith the Lord or keep
[2:13:07] still
[2:13:12] friends I just want to encourage you
[2:13:16] if you're spotting off we're speaking
[2:13:18] words that you know are not thus saith
[2:13:21] the Lord
[2:13:22] I say to your name of Jesus Christ stay
[2:13:25] still
[2:13:30] but pray unto God that he might give you
[2:13:33] his word
[2:13:35] pray unto God that from your very end
[2:13:38] there being would come forth the word of
[2:13:40] God as it was spoken in this last day
[2:13:43] for that is what is not safe now the
[2:13:46] word in this hour
[2:13:48] they know
[2:13:50] that it has to be God in them doing the
[2:13:53] works
[2:13:54] fulfilling his own word he is not
[2:13:57] complete all his work while he was a was
[2:14:00] in his Earthly Ministry
[2:14:02] so now he works in through the bride
[2:14:11] some moments ago I said the king's heart
[2:14:13] was in your hand
[2:14:15] so a moments ago I said you had a
[2:14:17] Ministry to do
[2:14:19] the prophet of God is telling us he
[2:14:22] could not complete all his work but he's
[2:14:23] got a multi-membered bride
[2:14:27] all position in a place formed for a
[2:14:31] purpose all having a a place a purpose
[2:14:35] let's not try to trample over one
[2:14:37] another let's not try to do another's

[2:20:10] functional obsolescence it just don't
[2:20:13] work
[2:20:14] it's just there
[2:20:16] God don't let us just be there
[2:20:20] and do nothing don't let us come to
