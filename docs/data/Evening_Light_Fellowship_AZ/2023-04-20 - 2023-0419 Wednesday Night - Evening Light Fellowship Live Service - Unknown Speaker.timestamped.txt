[8:07] received a text earlier today from
[8:08] Brother Randy Hale up in Prescott Valley
[8:10] and
[8:12] praise report and a prayer request so he
[8:14] wanted us to read those tonight he
[8:15] thankful the Lord is with his brother
[8:17] Rusty he had an abscess on his tonsils
[8:20] he had to be taken by ambulance to the
[8:22] hospital and Flagstaff where they
[8:24] performed surgery and he's doing well
[8:26] and he's recovering when he's asking we
[8:28] just continue to remember his brother
[8:29] Rusty in prayer also he's asking prayer
[8:32] for it he says a good long time deaf
[8:35] friend named Judy Ann lives in
[8:37] California she's been diagnosed with
[8:39] cancer and she'll be seen an oncologist
[8:41] tomorrow he says I'm believing for a
[8:44] good report so let's remember this
[8:45] friend of brother Randy's name Judy Ann
[8:48] pray the Lord just be with her in this
[8:50] situation
[8:51] brother Raul and his son James are
[8:54] traveling down to Mexico for brother
[8:56] Royal's sister's funeral and Lord
[8:58] willing they'll be coming back on Monday
[8:59] so we want to remember them as they
[9:01] travel pray the Lord will just watch
[9:03] over them and keep his hand of
[9:04] protection upon them while they're gone
[9:05] brother Ron received a call just before
[9:08] his service brother Arnold's 96 year old
[9:10] mother has passed away so let's remember
[9:13] brother Arnold pray the Lord be with him
[9:14] at this time and comfort him I think
[9:16] he's probably going to take some time by
[9:19] himself just
[9:21] grieve the loss of his mother and just
[9:23] sometimes you just need that time alone
[9:25] so pray for our Beth brother Arnold and
[9:28] just be his strength and his portion
[9:30] brother Matt vasaki is not feeling well
[9:32] tonight and as well brother Austin
[9:34] Johnson is not able to be here
[9:38] as well as that you remember our niece
[9:40] in Tucson her two-year-old daughter Ivy
[9:42] has been hospitalized for the last few
[9:45] days with pneumonia so if you remember a
[9:47] little Ivy Miller in prayer tonight be
[9:49] greatly appreciated we're gonna have our
[9:50] pastor come tonight and
[9:52] the Lord in prayer
[9:55] [Music]
[9:58] amen God bless you all this evening
[10:01] I wanted to give you
[10:04] a an update on brother Neil
[10:08] you all know that he had what they call
[10:10] an aortic dissection
[10:13] [Music]
[10:14] which is the aorta coming out of the top
[10:17] of the heart
[10:18] it it almost burst you know he had a
[10:22] heart attack they came in there and
[10:24] repaired that but
[10:26] all of the debris they call it the trash
[10:29] that was in the aorta fleshed out into
[10:33] his system
[10:34] and the
[10:37] uh they call his
[10:40] [Music]
[10:41] his medical condition trash foot you can
[10:46] look it up
[10:48] and what it is is
[10:51] all of the
[10:53] little things let's call it trash that
[10:57] came from the top of the heart
[10:59] all to the capillaries the smallest
[11:02] little carriers of blood throughout your
[11:05] body are in your fingers your nose and
[11:09] your toes
[11:11] and so what happens is it looks like
[11:13] frostbite
[11:15] starts to turn red then eventually turns
[11:18] black because it dies
[11:20] it's not getting blood flow
[11:23] they he saw a podiatrist yesterday
[11:28] and the podiatrist came in and he said
[11:31] uh
[11:33] we have watched this Condition it's been
[11:36] eight or nine weeks now since the heart
[11:40] attack I believe may be longer
[11:42] and
[11:44] um
[11:45] both feet are turning black
[11:48] and they are telling him
[11:52] um that they will amputate both of his
[11:55] feet below the knee
[11:57] [Music]
[12:00] yeah
[12:01] I want you to really be in prayer for
[12:04] brother Neil
[12:05] he's a man of the outdoors he loves to
[12:08] hunt he loves to hike he loves to fish
[12:11] and everything and yet
[12:13] even when he got the news
[12:16] yeah I took it a little bit hard but
[12:18] then even today sister Karen said he was
[12:22] he was kind of joking about certain
[12:25] things and and everything uh and yet
[12:29] um
[12:30] my heart is heavy
[12:34] and they asked well how soon do you want
[12:37] to actually do the operation and they
[12:40] said it's kind of up to him
[12:43] they said both feet are dead there is no
[12:47] blood circulation that are going to the
[12:49] feet
[12:50] he has on his hands
[12:54] and blackened tips on a couple
[12:57] his right thumb is black on the tip
[13:01] they may amputate that first digit
[13:06] over here they don't know
[13:09] just how far again what they have to do
[13:12] is to to find out how far is the blood
[13:15] flow
[13:16] because if there is no blood flow then
[13:19] what happens is that finger that digit
[13:22] that foot whatever it is it just turns
[13:25] black black and and and it's actually
[13:27] dying it's called necrosis
[13:31] and I believe that God can if he can
[13:35] raise the Dead
[13:39] I never say it's too late
[13:44] I would love to see
[13:46] that he wakes up in the morning and his
[13:49] toes are pink
[13:51] I just believe God is still God
[13:56] and I know that he is a Healer
[13:59] and I'm just asking God once again as we
[14:02] go before him
[14:04] to remember brother Neil all of these
[14:07] prayer requests brother Arnold his
[14:10] mother just passed away today he's

[27:06] creatures run and seek
[27:09] a better place to hide
[27:14] I heard the Thunder roll down in my soul
[27:20] then I bow
[27:23] my head
[27:26] and cry

[27:35] moving faster
[27:39] lightning
[27:40] flashing bright

[40:29] the Bible said in hagai Chapter 2 Verse
[40:33] 3
[40:34] I will read up to
[40:37] the ninth
[40:40] this is the question that we need to
[40:43] recognize our position in the last days
[40:48] hey guy
[40:53] chapter 2 verse 3 who is left among you
[40:57] that saw this house in her first Glory
[41:02] and how do you see it now
[41:07] is it not in your eyes in comparison of
[41:10] it as nothing
[41:13] yet now be strong osiruba Bell said the
[41:16] Lord and be strong o Joshua son of
[41:19] basudeik the high priest and be strong
[41:23] all the people of the land said the Lord

[41:32] word that I come
[41:35] covenanted with you
[41:37] when ye came out of Egypt so my spirit
[41:42] remain it among you fear ye not
[41:46] for thus sat the Lord of hosts yet once
[41:51] it is a little while I will shake
[41:55] the heavens and the earth and the Sea
[41:58] and the dry land and I will shake All
[42:01] Nations and the desire of the All Nation
[42:04] shall come and I will fill this house
[42:07] with Glory said the Lord of hosts the
[42:11] silver is mine the Gold is mine said the
[42:14] Lord of hosts the glory of this latter
[42:18] house shall be greater than of the
[42:21] former set the Lord of hosts
[42:24] and in this place I will give peace said
[42:28] the Lord of hosts let's bow our heads
[42:30] father
[42:32] as you said Lord to
[42:36] Elijah
[42:38] and Elisha Lord
[42:41] that this Elisha
[42:43] wants the power of Elijah so bad
[42:48] and he asked a hard thing Lord a double
[42:52] portion of the power of Elijah
[42:55] but you said I will give this to you
[42:59] and you
[43:01] will carry more power than Elijah
[43:07] now father
[43:08] it's your word again as this title Lord
[43:12] God
[43:14] we will read about this
[43:17] uh this house this present Temple Lord
[43:21] is greater than the former use my lips
[43:24] Lord speak to my lips
[43:27] oh I I ask you Lord God I'm an educated
[43:31] person but we want your Holy Ghost Lord
[43:34] God to preach your gospel Lord Jesus
[43:37] just use me Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[43:39] amen
[43:43] you can have a seat
[43:47] the Bible said actually the prophet
[43:50] was telling us
[43:55] why we're going and spread this gospel
[44:00] because we have the the the the the
[44:03] uh the the uh Covenant
[44:08] that this gospel must be preached
[44:12] to hold to the whole world
[44:15] that's why the prophet said here in the
[44:18] message my new ministry
[44:21] he said his program cannot move without
[44:25] you and I
[44:27] that's powerful
[44:30] God the creator of Heaven and Earth
[44:33] God made this world
[44:36] but then now in the last days he cannot
[44:39] move without you and me
[44:44] and as long as we're not doing what God
[44:47] led us to do
[44:49] we're paralyzing his program
[44:54] but when the church moved by the
[44:57] anointing of the Holy Ghost
[45:00] then we are Gods uh we are in God's will
[45:03] doing his program
[45:07] now you will know why I'm going to the
[45:11] mission field
[45:13] I thank you for your prayers I thank you
[45:16] for your support brother Ron
[45:18] but one day
[45:20] people will come and Shake Your Hand
[45:23] and you don't even know them
[45:25] but because you sent me
[45:29] because you prayed for me
[45:31] you are the crown also
[45:34] you will receive a crown also because
[45:38] you sent me to this lost and dying world
[45:42] amen
[45:44] the prophet said here
[45:46] in the Patmos vision
[45:49] he said God is depending upon his church
[45:54] God is relying on us of this age to
[45:59] bring this Gospel Light to a dying heat
[46:02] and bound traditional world
[46:05] God is laying the burden on you and me
[46:09] and Wu unto us
[46:12] if the heat and dies
[46:14] without knowing
[46:17] amen praise the Lord
[46:21] now I will preach
[46:25] amen
[46:28] this is I'm not a a teacher I'm an
[46:31] evangelist
[46:33] but I was God is leading me to this uh
[46:37] uh scriptures and it's so hard because
[46:41] this is like a teaching service
[46:44] amen
[46:48] so hey guy
[46:51] when when when God
[46:54] called
[46:56] Jeremiah and told Jeremiah you need to
[47:00] tell to the tell tell to the children of
[47:03] Israel
[47:04] that one day
[47:06] they will go into captivity
[47:10] in Jeremiah chapter 25 verse 11 and this
[47:14] whole land shall be desolation
[47:17] and as as an an astonishment and this
[47:22] nation Shall Serve the king of Babylon
[47:25] 70 years
[47:28] there's only one law
[47:31] and the the Israelites the the Hebrews
[47:34] needs to follow
[47:36] and that law
[47:38] is what you you saw
[47:42] is the same thing we will reap
[47:44] sowing and reaping
[47:47] and the law of God is the same thing
[47:49] today
[47:51] what you saw is what you reap
[47:56] but because they saw and worshiped idols
[48:00] fornications
[48:02] now God allowed the Heathen to captive
[48:07] them for 70 years
[48:09] but then in Jeremiah chapter 29 10
[48:13] for thus said the Lord that after 70
[48:17] years there's a promise
[48:20] be accomplished at Babylon I will visit
[48:24] you and perform my good words toward you
[48:28] in causing you to return to this place
[48:33] God has a promise
[48:35] because God still the children of Israel
[48:39] are his Apple beside
[48:42] amen and here God anointed Ezra
[48:47] and then uh Ezra was was uh writing this
[48:52] and then when the the Babylonian lost
[48:55] the battle and then here's the King of
[48:58] Persia King Cyrus
[49:01] he said in Ezra chapter 1
[49:07] now in the first year of Cyrus King of
[49:10] Persia
[49:12] what the word of the Lord by the mouth
[49:15] of Jeremiah might be fulfilled
[49:18] the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus
[49:23] King of Persia that he made the
[49:25] proclamation throughout all the kingdom
[49:28] and put it also in writing saying
[49:34] thus said the Lord Cyrus King of Persia
[49:38] the Lord God Of Heaven hath given me all
[49:42] the kingdoms of the earth and he had
[49:45] charged me to build him a house at
[49:48] Jerusalem which is in Judah
[49:53] and then here the children of Israel
[49:56] went back to their Homeland
[50:01] that was good
[50:03] but then when they went back to their
[50:06] Homeland
[50:07] they forgot that their purpose to go
[50:10] back to their Homeland is to build the
[50:12] temple and worship again
[50:17] my mouth is dry
[50:20] I'm shaking here
[50:30] in Ezra chapter 10 13
[50:34] and when the builders
[50:37] lay the foundation of the Temple of the
[50:40] Lord
[50:41] they set the priest in their apparel
[50:44] with trumpets and Levites the son of
[50:47] Assad with symbols to praise the Lord
[50:50] after the ordinance of David king of
[50:54] Israel
[50:55] and they sung together by course
[50:58] embracing and giving thanks unto the
[51:01] Lord because he is good for his Mercy
[51:05] endure it forever toward Israel
[51:09] and all the people shouted with great
[51:12] Shout
[51:13] when they praised the Lord because the
[51:16] foundation of the house of the Lord was
[51:19] laid
[51:21] but many priests here's here's our I'm
[51:25] I'm going
[51:27] but many of the priests
[51:30] and Lee bites and heads of the father's
[51:34] house old men who have been the first
[51:38] temple
[51:40] whipped with a loud voice when the
[51:43] foundation of the temple was laid before
[51:45] their eyes
[51:47] yet many shouted aloud for joy
[51:52] so that the people could not discern the
[51:55] noise of the shout of Joy from the noise
[51:58] of the Weeping of the people
[52:01] for the Weeping for the people shouted
[52:04] with a loud shout and the sound was here
[52:08] afar up
[52:10] the children that was born from Babylon
[52:17] was so excited to go back to to
[52:20] Jerusalem to build the temple
[52:24] but when they were building the Temple
[52:27] they were happy they were shouting for
[52:29] Joy they were praising God
[52:32] but the people that was there before
[52:37] saw the building of the Temple of
[52:40] Solomon was crying
[52:43] with a loud voice
[52:46] screaming how poor is this second temple
[52:50] this staple is so ugly
[52:53] I can see when the Temple of Solomon was
[52:57] built the precious stones from different
[53:01] countries they brought The Cedars from
[53:05] Babylon they brought
[53:09] it was a glorious
[53:12] day that was
[53:18] but then when they saw
[53:21] the second temple
[53:23] they were crying
[53:26] they were whipping
[53:28] our God is a poor God
[53:37] well as brother
[53:40] Andreas was preaching about the second
[53:43] Chronicles chapter 5 13.
[53:46] it said
[53:48] they remembered those old men
[53:52] that was there
[53:54] they remembered
[53:56] that it came even to pass as the
[54:00] trumpeters and singers were as one
[54:03] to make one sound to be heard in
[54:06] praising and thanking the lord
[54:08] and then when they lifted up their voice
[54:11] with the trumpets and symbols and
[54:14] instruments of music
[54:17] and praise the Lord saying for he is
[54:21] good
[54:22] for his mercy endureth forever that then
[54:25] the house was filled with a cloud even
[54:29] the house of the Lord so that the priest
[54:32] could not stand to Ministry by the
[54:35] reason of the cloud
[54:37] for the glory of the Lord had filled
[54:40] that house with God I remember those
[54:43] days
[54:45] the old people said
[54:47] I was there when the cloud came down
[54:51] I was there I was shaking
[54:55] because of the presence of the Lord and
[54:58] the priest can administered because of
[55:01] the presence of the Lord
[55:03] think about it right now
[55:06] your position right now
[55:11] they did not know
[55:14] that God
[55:16] is is prophesying
[55:19] about the future Temple
[55:29] foreign
[55:38] so here is the ministry
[55:42] that hey guy was prophesying
[55:46] it's not a temple that build with hands
[55:51] God is prophesying
[55:55] to a temple
[55:57] that's inside of the flesh
[56:01] not the building
[56:05] in Isaiah 53
[56:08] the Bible said who had believed a report
[56:12] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[56:14] revealed
[56:16] for he shall grow up before him as a
[56:19] tender plant and as a root out of the
[56:22] dry ground
[56:23] he had no nor
[56:26] calmliness
[56:28] and when he shall see him
[56:31] or we shall see him there is no beauty
[56:34] that we should desire him
[56:38] that's the temple
[56:40] that that that hey guy was projecting to
[56:43] the people
[56:45] but the the the the so-called children
[56:49] of God cannot understand the ministry
[56:52] the the the the the revelation of God
[56:58] now here the prophet said in the
[57:00] identified Christ of all ages
[57:04] he said
[57:07] because he was the word that made that
[57:12] that age
[57:13] was identified in a human body
[57:17] a boy that had no education
[57:21] that we never know him going to school
[57:25] we had no credentials
[57:29] he even come out of any organization of
[57:33] that day
[57:34] no education
[57:36] no reputation of nothing
[57:39] but a crazy man
[57:42] a wine Bieber a friend of Sinner a man
[57:46] turning the world upside down
[57:50] illegitimately born his mother was
[57:53] pregnated by a soldier and taking his
[57:57] name as a Son of God or a calling
[58:00] himself a prophet
[58:02] this Galilee and so-called prophet
[58:06] but the word was made flesh
[58:10] as many as received him to them gave he
[58:14] the power to become sons of God how many
[58:17] of you receive him tonight
[58:19] and you received him already
[58:21] now we have the power
[58:24] and God called you the Sons and
[58:26] Daughters of God
[58:28] amen
[58:30] now here's Jesus Christ standing in the
[58:34] in the midst of the high priest
[58:39] and Jesus in Matthew chapter 12 6 he
[58:42] said but I say unto you that in this
[58:45] place is one greater than the temple
[58:48] and that high priest was
[58:51] who are you
[58:53] I know you're you're you're uh uh a man
[58:57] that doesn't have a credential
[59:00] who are you
[59:02] they did not know that God made flesh
[59:06] God bailed
[59:09] in this body
[59:11] called Jesus
[59:15] now here in in John Chapter 2 19 20.
[59:21] I'm just laying down the foundation
[59:25] Jesus answered and said unto them
[59:28] destroyed this Temple
[59:30] and in three days I will raise it up
[59:33] then said the Jews
[59:35] 40 and six years we built this Temple
[59:40] and you will destroy it in three days
[59:42] you will raise it up
[59:45] no revelation
[59:48] blinded
[59:52] think about it today
[59:57] but they forgot
[1:00:00] the message of hagai
[1:00:04] who is left among you
[1:00:07] that saw this house in her first Glory
[1:00:11] and now
[1:00:13] how do you see it now
[1:00:16] that's the question
[1:00:19] but then God said
[1:00:21] the glory of this latter house
[1:00:25] is greater than the former set the Lord
[1:00:29] of hosts
[1:00:30] all this place will be given peace set
[1:00:34] the Lord opposed
[1:00:37] now I'm going to my direction
[1:00:42] in the message
[1:00:46] is this the sign of the answer
[1:00:49] that's the question
[1:00:51] here is
[1:00:53] brother Jackson
[1:00:55] had a dream
[1:00:58] he said and said
[1:01:01] then you pick up something like from the
[1:01:04] air something like a A Wrecking Bar
[1:01:08] a crowbar wasn't it oh brother something
[1:01:11] like that
[1:01:13] A A Wrecking Bar real sharp and said
[1:01:17] it's how you done it and I don't know
[1:01:21] and said you struck the top of that
[1:01:24] mountain
[1:01:25] and rip it around
[1:01:27] and lifted the cup of it off
[1:01:34] how
[1:01:36] that was months and months and months
[1:01:38] before the pyramid message I will jump
[1:01:41] to 131.
[1:01:44] and said look upon this light
[1:01:48] when when brother Branham on the dream
[1:01:52] with a sharp rod
[1:01:54] or a crowbar
[1:01:57] cut the top of the mountain or or The
[1:02:01] Rock
[1:02:02] and that rock came out there was a white
[1:02:06] stone
[1:02:08] now it said and upon before and when all
[1:02:12] of them got up
[1:02:13] and I told them to watch that
[1:02:17] and all of them come up to look in
[1:02:21] all of them the people that was
[1:02:24] following the prophet
[1:02:27] look on that
[1:02:30] but he said while they were looking in
[1:02:34] he looked out of the corner of his eyes
[1:02:38] I believe it was and watch me
[1:02:42] slip up to one side and started going
[1:02:46] towards the West
[1:02:48] towards the seating of the Sun
[1:02:51] coming up a hill going down a hill
[1:02:54] coming up a hill going down a hill
[1:02:57] getting smaller and smaller and went all
[1:03:00] the way out of sight
[1:03:03] yeah here's the people that was looking
[1:03:07] on that white stone revelation
[1:03:11] Jesus Christ
[1:03:13] you need to keep your eyes on him not to
[1:03:17] the ministry
[1:03:19] but here the people that was following
[1:03:22] the prophet
[1:03:23] and he said when I did that he said that
[1:03:27] the Brethren turn around after a while
[1:03:30] said
[1:03:32] did he vanish where's brother Branham I
[1:03:35] want to see brother Branham they forgot
[1:03:38] the message they forgot to look on the
[1:03:42] White Stone
[1:03:45] where's the prophet I cannot live
[1:03:47] without the prophet
[1:03:49] he's my life I need I need him to come
[1:03:52] back because without him I'm not perfect
[1:04:02] and weigh some look one way
[1:04:05] and some another
[1:04:08] but a few
[1:04:11] stayed
[1:04:13] and look on what I had told them and I
[1:04:17] believe brother Ron
[1:04:18] that's me and you that's all of us here
[1:04:22] that will stay what the prophet said
[1:04:25] that we will lock on Jesus Christ
[1:04:30] oh brother I don't want to go ahead of
[1:04:32] my
[1:04:39] the prophet said here
[1:04:41] in the god hiding
[1:04:44] himself in simplicity
[1:04:51] he said but God in the beginning
[1:04:54] that could have made the son preach the
[1:04:57] gospel think of it
[1:05:00] remembered my first coat
[1:05:03] you and I
[1:05:05] Without You and I
[1:05:08] gonna God cannot perform his purpose
[1:05:13] but here the prophet said
[1:05:16] he can use the son to preach the gospel
[1:05:21] or the wind to preach the gospel or an
[1:05:24] angel to preach the gospel
[1:05:28] see without Revelation brother if an
[1:05:30] angel will come
[1:05:31] without wings
[1:05:33] maybe we will listen to to that angel
[1:05:36] more than me
[1:05:40] but then
[1:05:42] if you have a revelation
[1:05:47] better than the angel
[1:05:49] who is greater
[1:05:51] angels that protecting you or the angel
[1:05:54] in the pulpit
[1:05:56] that's a big question of the prophet
[1:06:01] but here he said
[1:06:03] but uh uh he ordered the man
[1:06:06] for that purpose
[1:06:09] and he never changed it
[1:06:12] he never ordained the nomination he
[1:06:16] never ordained groups of men he ordained
[1:06:19] men to preach the gospel
[1:06:22] a machinery
[1:06:26] brother Ezra amen not the machinery
[1:06:40] or our mechanical devices
[1:06:44] or an Angelic being
[1:06:47] it was men
[1:06:55] so thankful
[1:06:56] that God opened our eyes brother Robert
[1:07:01] how can we say
[1:07:02] all we can say is thank you Lord amen
[1:07:05] amen that there's so many
[1:07:08] rich and famous and smart people
[1:07:12] that's still listening to the tape
[1:07:18] Brothers
[1:07:19] I love the prophet hundred percent or
[1:07:22] maybe hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[1:07:25] of times percent
[1:07:35] somebody told me
[1:07:37] go watch the Youtube
[1:07:40] you can see a man and a woman married by
[1:07:44] the tape
[1:07:45] I thought it was it's a joke
[1:07:50] but when I listened to that
[1:07:53] brother
[1:07:56] this message is true
[1:07:58] this message is hundred percent God made
[1:08:03] manifest
[1:08:06] but the people that came in brought
[1:08:10] their denominational ideas
[1:08:15] you know what happened
[1:08:17] they make this message a cult
[1:08:22] I am jealous I am zealous
[1:08:27] Brothers
[1:08:31] that's why salvation is individual
[1:08:35] salvation a pew
[1:08:38] know that this church is right stay with
[1:08:41] it obey what the preacher is preaching
[1:08:44] here
[1:08:46] we believe that there are three kinds of
[1:08:48] Believers but why choose the two if
[1:08:51] you're a believer
[1:08:57] you know I heard so many times the the
[1:08:59] messages about this they quote this a
[1:09:02] lot
[1:09:02] Christ revealed in his own word
[1:09:06] the prophet said here you must not
[1:09:09] misinterpret the word
[1:09:15] you say well I believe it means this
[1:09:19] it's me it means just what it says
[1:09:23] it needs no interpreter
[1:09:26] and you must not misplace the word
[1:09:30] and you must not dislocate the word
[1:09:34] and if you or if we would do either of
[1:09:38] this it would it will throw the whole
[1:09:42] Bible in a confusion
[1:09:45] and in a chaos
[1:09:50] see
[1:09:55] that's why I just
[1:09:57] we brother one we stay we we preach what
[1:10:00] the prophet preach
[1:10:02] you know the Bible the message said
[1:10:04] you're not feeding on a man
[1:10:08] a man this words will fail by your
[1:10:12] feeding or feeding on the unfail or
[1:10:17] again again we're not feeding on a man
[1:10:21] a man his words were fail
[1:10:24] but you're feeding on unfailing body
[1:10:26] word of the son of man
[1:10:29] the prophet was just there
[1:10:33] but it's in him he is the one I'm just
[1:10:38] an instrument the minister here is just
[1:10:40] an instrument
[1:10:47] the prophet said here
[1:10:49] in the last days
[1:10:52] there is again another people in the
[1:10:54] land
[1:10:56] who under their Messenger will be the
[1:10:59] final voice
[1:11:02] we heard so many times we are the final
[1:11:05] voice
[1:11:06] we are in the final Age The Bride is in
[1:11:09] the final voice he says it's a final
[1:11:11] voice
[1:11:13] but you forgot you need to read that
[1:11:16] before
[1:11:18] under their messenger we need to stay
[1:11:22] the message the prophet under their
[1:11:26] messenger we are the final voice
[1:11:33] that's important brother
[1:11:38] now
[1:11:40] remember
[1:11:42] I was like
[1:11:43] reading about this Moses uh the book of
[1:11:46] Moses
[1:11:48] when when the when the prophet saw the
[1:11:52] vision
[1:11:53] about the the tent in the heaven the
[1:11:57] temple
[1:11:58] now
[1:12:00] Moses followed what he saw
[1:12:04] and when he saw that the temple it was a
[1:12:07] tent
[1:12:09] now why because if
[1:12:12] the pillar of fire move
[1:12:15] they move also
[1:12:19] but here's the desire of David he wants
[1:12:22] to build a house
[1:12:24] oh a maid of precious stones Golds and
[1:12:28] everything but to begin with
[1:12:31] the the house of the Lord is in the tent
[1:12:34] because the tent needs to follow what
[1:12:37] the pillar of fire goes or where the
[1:12:40] filler pillar of our ghosts
[1:12:44] are you thankful that in the last days
[1:12:47] God did not come in the nice Temple
[1:12:51] in a big
[1:12:53] 100 millions
[1:12:57] in in Houston
[1:13:02] the prophet said here oh how be it or
[1:13:05] the Bible how be it the most high
[1:13:07] dwelleth not in Temple made with hands
[1:13:10] as thus said the Lord or the Saint the
[1:13:13] prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is
[1:13:18] my footstool
[1:13:20] what house will you build me
[1:13:24] God is so big that God cannot fit in
[1:13:28] this house in this church
[1:13:31] so big that
[1:13:32] that he cannot
[1:13:33] that's here or sit here
[1:13:36] but he choose
[1:13:38] to be small
[1:13:40] and wants to live in your soul
[1:13:45] he become a tiny germ the god the big
[1:13:50] God
[1:13:51] that he cannot sit in Temple made with
[1:13:54] hands
[1:13:55] but he decided to to become a very tiny
[1:14:00] germ
[1:14:01] to live in your heart in my heart
[1:14:06] I wish you understand that brothers and
[1:14:08] sisters
[1:14:15] the prophet said here
[1:14:17] in this time
[1:14:20] it's been an evening for so long
[1:14:24] it's a and then the evening for so long
[1:14:26] long long time
[1:14:28] it's a dismal time
[1:14:30] so a dangerous time
[1:14:34] remember Twilight is the most dangerous
[1:14:37] time of all
[1:14:39] we are in a Twilight now
[1:14:42] even time the gross Darkness
[1:14:47] and the prophet said this is the most
[1:14:49] deceiving time
[1:14:51] because it's gloomy
[1:14:54] there's a light but it's so dangerous
[1:15:00] so he said the most dangerous day you
[1:15:03] ever live in
[1:15:05] the Bible said in Matthew 24 it would
[1:15:08] come to pass in the last days till we
[1:15:11] were or it it would deceive the very
[1:15:14] elect
[1:15:17] cannot be deceived
[1:15:20] because you know why
[1:15:23] as I said while ago God
[1:15:26] cannot live in a big Temple
[1:15:30] but here the word of God said
[1:15:33] if the word will come
[1:15:36] takes a veil brother Raymond
[1:15:40] it takes a veil
[1:15:42] or you will die
[1:15:46] when the the word of God came to Moses
[1:15:50] his face was shining
[1:15:52] and it put he put a veil in his face
[1:15:58] and then when when when when when Jesus
[1:16:01] came
[1:16:02] in the manger he was wrapped with
[1:16:05] swaddling clothes
[1:16:08] the word
[1:16:10] is in Baal
[1:16:13] is it a correct English
[1:16:17] fail
[1:16:18] now
[1:16:22] in the Old Testament
[1:16:25] God was in Badger skin
[1:16:30] he needs to put a veil
[1:16:33] or the high priest needs to cover that
[1:16:36] because the word of God
[1:16:39] once there's no covering
[1:16:42] you cannot enter or you will die
[1:16:46] but then how precious how how wonderful
[1:16:50] this our
[1:16:52] prophet in the Malachi chapter four five
[1:16:54] and six Luke 17 30. Revelation chapter
[1:16:58] 10.
[1:17:00] that God revealed this to us
[1:17:03] so that we can know the mind of God
[1:17:07] that we know who we are
[1:17:10] that's what brother Michael said Don't
[1:17:13] Preach to me tell me who I am
[1:17:18] this is this is what I want to know also
[1:17:22] Lord tell me who I am
[1:17:25] Who I Am Lord
[1:17:29] who I am
[1:17:34] oh but if the spirit of him that raised
[1:17:38] Jesus Christ from the dead dwelts in you
[1:17:42] it will Quicken our mortal bodies
[1:17:45] that's what we are
[1:17:47] now here's the temple
[1:17:50] God
[1:17:51] Genesis
[1:17:54] God in Greek word he poured out
[1:17:58] he's all in all
[1:18:00] the Elohim
[1:18:02] the great God the self-existing one
[1:18:07] poured out
[1:18:09] to his people
[1:18:11] gymnosis
[1:18:15] my
[1:18:17] brother's nuts
[1:18:19] I love it
[1:18:24] and it shall come to pass
[1:18:26] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[1:18:29] upon All Flesh
[1:18:31] the latter rain
[1:18:33] all the power of God
[1:18:36] that's why you you there's so many
[1:18:38] that's why there's so many why there's
[1:18:40] so many doctrines here
[1:18:42] because they said they cannot see the
[1:18:44] power of God
[1:18:46] we need the return of the powerful
[1:18:49] message the Flesh of the prophet
[1:18:56] but they forgot
[1:18:58] that next to them next to them
[1:19:02] kenosis
[1:19:05] he poured out
[1:19:07] his everything
[1:19:10] to these people
[1:19:12] to you brother
[1:19:16] my
[1:19:19] now
[1:19:21] the prophet said in everything
[1:19:25] now he said in everything every time
[1:19:29] and no scripture can be broken
[1:19:32] and the same Sun that poured out himself
[1:19:38] kinos
[1:19:40] to the day of Pentecost promised to do
[1:19:44] the same thing
[1:19:45] in the evening time
[1:19:48] it's the same the continuation of the
[1:19:50] book of Acts is here
[1:19:52] brother I don't know about you but I see
[1:19:57] Miracles every day
[1:19:59] go with me I will show you
[1:20:03] what a miracle working God is in our
[1:20:06] lives
[1:20:08] I was with Brother on Monday and we me
[1:20:12] and brother Mark we were talking and
[1:20:16] then brother brother David was reminding
[1:20:19] brother Ron about brother Peregrine when
[1:20:23] brother Peregrine gave him a offering
[1:20:27] but all of the sudden he lost
[1:20:32] but then here
[1:20:35] Peregrine called him and says Big
[1:20:38] Brother how do how bad do you want that
[1:20:41] money
[1:20:43] how bad do you want that money speak
[1:20:50] there was a doubt brother Ron
[1:20:52] but you spoke anyway right
[1:20:55] and he opened the blood the glove box at
[1:20:58] the money fell
[1:21:01] see that's the same God
[1:21:04] that when the prophet said oh little
[1:21:07] fishy I will give you life
[1:21:10] it's the same power today because it's
[1:21:13] the same holy spirit that was in the
[1:21:16] prophet as here today
[1:21:20] Brothers I'm not I'm not joking here uh
[1:21:25] there's so many false spread preachers
[1:21:28] false prophets are around the world but
[1:21:31] if there's false there are genuine also
[1:21:35] and I believe I'm one of them you're one
[1:21:38] of them
[1:21:40] we go
[1:21:45] Colossians chapter 2 9 for in him
[1:21:49] dwelleth of the fullness of godhead
[1:21:53] bodily
[1:21:54] but then here in Colossians 1 27
[1:21:58] Christ in you
[1:22:01] the hope of glory
[1:22:05] that's why the prophet the brother
[1:22:07] brother
[1:22:08] Andreas was telling us don't put God In
[1:22:12] The Box
[1:22:14] let him move to your life Brothers
[1:22:18] speak the word if you have problem with
[1:22:21] your weaknesses speak the word
[1:22:33] Hebrew 12 26.
[1:22:37] whose voice
[1:22:38] then shook the Earth
[1:22:42] see in the time of Moses
[1:22:46] every time God spoke to the people it
[1:22:49] shook the Earth
[1:22:51] but then in the last days
[1:22:55] brother and God in flesh
[1:22:59] every time we speak the word
[1:23:02] brother not the Earth shaking it's not
[1:23:05] the Earth shakes but now he promised
[1:23:09] saying yet once more
[1:23:12] I will shake not the Earth only
[1:23:15] but also heaven
[1:23:17] see Brothers
[1:23:19] you know Paul said when they saw Paul
[1:23:22] was preaching and so many people come to
[1:23:25] Christ and the people said we need to
[1:23:27] stop him
[1:23:29] because he turned the world upside down
[1:23:33] Brothers
[1:23:35] today
[1:23:36] you hear the news the world is upside
[1:23:40] down already but God anointed you and me
[1:23:43] to turn the world back to original
[1:23:46] position
[1:23:48] we have a things to do brother Amos
[1:23:53] we have things to do and big
[1:23:56] and Powerful
[1:24:01] oh brother
[1:24:02] Mark shout out John chapter 14 12.
[1:24:07] it's the same power here the things that
[1:24:10] I do you will do also
[1:24:14] Mark 16 in action
[1:24:17] this sign shall follow to them that
[1:24:20] believe
[1:24:23] as I said
[1:24:24] to brother one he spoke the word
[1:24:28] you know Brothers I saw so many miracles
[1:24:31] in my life
[1:24:34] how about you and me
[1:24:36] how about you
[1:24:38] you will see that
[1:24:40] if you put yourself you know the prophet
[1:24:43] said
[1:24:44] Jesus was so in with the word and he
[1:24:48] became the word
[1:24:51] if we are so
[1:24:54] like putting the word in of God first
[1:24:58] we will become the word
[1:25:02] now that's the time you can say oh
[1:25:06] he walks with me
[1:25:08] and talks with me
[1:25:10] a long lights narrow way
[1:25:13] he lives he lives where
[1:25:17] in my
[1:25:19] heart in your heart
[1:25:21] now the song will become you
[1:25:24] now it's not a song anymore it's a
[1:25:28] testimony
[1:25:30] now you can go to Walmart and people
[1:25:33] will see word walking
[1:25:36] sisters
[1:25:38] please don't cut your hair because you
[1:25:41] are a testimony
[1:25:43] oh brother sisters
[1:25:46] I don't believe in above the knee all
[1:25:48] the time
[1:25:49] because there's so many worldly women
[1:25:53] wearing that above the knee
[1:25:55] like a woman act like the word
[1:25:59] please please
[1:26:01] don't the prophet turn don't turn him
[1:26:04] down
[1:26:06] we have so many things to do
[1:26:09] and you are the Fulfillment of that
[1:26:12] because he cannot do anything without
[1:26:15] you
[1:26:23] question and answer
[1:26:29] foreign
[1:26:41] could Jesus look like you
[1:26:43] or you be Jesus or something like that
[1:26:49] the prophet said see the Miracles that
[1:26:51] happened to him
[1:26:54] so many miracles that people
[1:26:57] thought it was Jesus Christ
[1:27:04] but here's the answer
[1:27:06] in one sense
[1:27:08] of the word that's exactly the truth
[1:27:15] and another sense of the word it's an
[1:27:19] antichrist
[1:27:22] Christ that's the difference between
[1:27:24] right and wrong
[1:27:26] to make me the person of Jesus Christ
[1:27:29] Our Lord Jesus Christ would be an
[1:27:32] antichrist see for that person of the
[1:27:36] Lord Jesus Christ is sitting at the
[1:27:38] right hand of the uh of the Majesty on
[1:27:42] high
[1:27:42] and it will come again in a great power
[1:27:47] and Glory
[1:27:48] but for his life that wasn't him upon me
[1:27:58] upon me
[1:28:01] upon you
[1:28:03] who have him it's exactly the truth
[1:28:08] and you become Christ
[1:28:16] oh brother Feed me more
[1:28:19] tell me more
[1:28:22] tell me more Elisa
[1:28:27] remember my message Messiah
[1:28:31] see
[1:28:33] the word Messiah means
[1:28:36] the anointed one
[1:28:39] now you are
[1:28:41] if you have the Holy Ghost or the Holy
[1:28:43] Spirit you become the anointed one
[1:28:48] see
[1:28:49] then there's all kinds of anointed ones
[1:28:53] now watch the Bible anointed one once
[1:28:57] many of them are anointed
[1:29:01] the whole thing is in such a great
[1:29:04] conglomeration of every kind of mix-up
[1:29:08] and Satan with all his cunningness come
[1:29:14] in and impersonate it just
[1:29:17] to the Dutch
[1:29:19] almost to the DOT
[1:29:21] there's only one way you can absolutely
[1:29:24] be sure
[1:29:26] check the word by word word by word
[1:29:31] and I was checking by the word by word
[1:29:35] and it become the the word pointed me
[1:29:40] brother Amos that I am
[1:29:43] X
[1:29:46] that you are the Messiahs
[1:29:49] the anointed once in your day
[1:29:53] well brother we have so many things to
[1:29:56] do tell the world
[1:30:04] but to be
[1:30:07] Anointed with his Spirit which bring his
[1:30:11] own person of his life and to you
[1:30:15] 95. now when it comes to a creation of
[1:30:20] things it's true Jesus never writes
[1:30:24] straight and created anything and
[1:30:26] brought it into experience
[1:30:28] he took a substance first he took water
[1:30:32] and made wine he took bread and made
[1:30:35] more bread he took fish and made more
[1:30:38] fish but he promised that greater things
[1:30:41] than this would be done see you see now
[1:30:46] it's in more evil day than I was than it
[1:30:51] was when when he was here
[1:30:54] see it's still him by you saying your
[1:31:00] heart
[1:31:04] we are the temple
[1:31:06] and Paul quoted that scripture and told
[1:31:10] to the disciples to the Believers he
[1:31:13] said no ye not know he not you are the
[1:31:17] temple
[1:31:18] it's not in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:31:22] anymore
[1:31:23] Jesus Christ
[1:31:26] his Spirit right now is in you and me
[1:31:31] now we can sing No ye not know ye not we
[1:31:34] are the temple
[1:31:36] no ye not no you're not you are the
[1:31:39] temple
[1:31:41] I wish I could sing like brother Mark
[1:31:43] and brother Robert
[1:31:48] God he said now the invisible God the
[1:31:54] word was invincible until it was made
[1:31:56] flesh and then the word become visible
[1:32:02] can you see yourself
[1:32:04] the word become visible
[1:32:10] brothers and sisters
[1:32:14] that's why
[1:32:17] the Bible said in Revelation chapter 21
[1:32:20] 3
[1:32:21] it said and I heard a great voice out of
[1:32:25] Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of
[1:32:28] God is with men
[1:32:31] is with men
[1:32:33] and he will dwell
[1:32:35] where
[1:32:37] with them
[1:32:42] and God himself shall be with them
[1:32:46] and be their God
[1:32:48] Lord forgive us if we cannot accept this
[1:32:52] it's too much
[1:32:55] but I pray brothers and sisters
[1:32:59] that this Revelation that we got
[1:33:02] I want to share this to the world
[1:33:05] that this Temple
[1:33:07] is greater
[1:33:10] than before
[1:33:12] there's so many brothers and sisters
[1:33:14] right now
[1:33:16] believing
[1:33:18] that brother Branham
[1:33:21] where is he
[1:33:23] is he where is he
[1:33:26] but to me the spirit of brother Branham
[1:33:29] it's in the bride right now the spirit
[1:33:32] that was in Jesus Christ is in the pride
[1:33:35] right now
[1:33:36] don't wait that this Spirit right now
[1:33:39] will go to Israel
[1:33:41] as long as we are here the spirit of God
[1:33:44] is in here
[1:33:45] we have so many things to do brothers
[1:33:48] and sisters
[1:33:50] share the word
[1:33:52] brother he must share the word
[1:33:55] God bless you
[1:33:57] I pray that
[1:33:59] God bless you uh God will continue to
[1:34:01] bless you
[1:34:02] that all of us here
[1:34:05] will bring the world the word of God to
[1:34:08] the world
[1:34:10] Amen brother Ron God bless you
[1:34:13] [Applause]
[1:34:23] amen
[1:34:26] God bless you let's stand together this
[1:34:28] evening
[1:34:32] when you begin to realize who you are
[1:34:35] and then the prophet said
[1:34:37] one day after I'm gone
[1:34:40] you begin to catch these things
[1:34:42] God would not permit it to be done now
[1:34:46] but he says then you're going to begin
[1:34:47] to catch
[1:34:49] that Revelation not of who he is
[1:34:53] but of Who You Are
[1:34:56] because
[1:34:58] the mystery continues
[1:35:03] you realize you are the mystery of God
[1:35:05] now being revealed
[1:35:08] just as Christ was a mystery
[1:35:11] you're now a continuation of the same
[1:35:14] mystery just in a different form
[1:35:18] Eve
[1:35:19] was a mystery of Adam revealed
[1:35:23] the bride
[1:35:25] is the mystery of Christ revealed
[1:35:30] this is that
[1:35:32] that was hid down from the ages
[1:35:36] but it's now made manifest to his Saints
[1:35:40] what is it Christ in you
[1:35:43] the hope of glory what kind of people
[1:35:45] does that make us be
[1:35:47] oh thank you Lord that you came and gave
[1:35:50] us a prophet but though we have a
[1:35:54] prophetic word and though it was spoken
[1:35:58] saints of God we've got to have the
[1:36:00] Divine revealer take that spoken word
[1:36:03] and make it alive to us otherwise we
[1:36:07] just make it a Creed and a dogma and
[1:36:10] some kind of teaching
[1:36:12] oh let the Holy Spirit
[1:36:15] have his way in our lives
[1:36:18] and let us
[1:36:20] come to our position amen amen I prayed
