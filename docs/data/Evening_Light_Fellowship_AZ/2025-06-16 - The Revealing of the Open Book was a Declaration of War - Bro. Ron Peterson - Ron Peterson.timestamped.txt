[30:10] declaration of song. And what is it? It
[30:12] is Christ in you and I. That's a
[30:16] beautiful song. Thank you for singing
[30:17] that today.
[30:19] [Applause]
[30:22] Let's stand this morning as we get ready
[30:24] to change the word of the service this
[30:26] morning. Good, good father.
[30:32] That's what he is to me. He's a good
[30:36] good father. Are you thankful for the
[30:38] heavenly father in your life? Let's sing
[30:40] this this morning. this morning as we
[30:43] get ready to change the order of the
[30:44] service.
[30:47] [Music]
[30:48] Lord, it's just not a song, but it's a
[30:51] relationship with you, Lord. That we can
[30:53] say, "Aba, Father, what a father you
[30:56] are." And I've heard a thousand stories
[31:02] of what they think you're like. And I've
[31:08] heard the
[31:11] tender whisper of love in the dead of
[31:18] And you tell me
[31:21] that you're pleasing that I never alone.
[31:26] You're a good good father. It's who you
[31:30] are.

[31:40] It's who I am. It's who I am.
[31:45] It's who I am.
[31:49] And I sly
[31:53] searching for answers
[31:57] far and wide. But I know we're all
[32:03] searching for answers.
[32:06] Only you provide because you
[32:11] give us what we need before we say word.
[32:17] You're a good good father. It's who you
[32:21] are. It's who you are.
[32:26] It's who you are. And I'm loved by you.
[32:30] It's who I.

[32:54] us.
[32:59] You are perfect in all. Yes, he is. You
[33:04] are perfect in all. Love your ways.
[33:08] You are perfect in all. Love your ways
[33:13] to us.
[33:16] [Music]
[33:19] Love so
[33:22] uniable
[33:24] I can hardly speak. Peace so
[33:32] unexplainable.
[33:35] I can't hardly think. And you call me
[33:42] deeper still. And you call me
[33:47] deeper. Thank you, Lord. You call me
[33:52] deeper still into love, love, love.
[33:57] Nana, you're a good father.
[34:03] Can you say amen? Can you lift your hand
[34:05] and say, "It's who you are." Oh, and I'm
[34:08] loved by you. It's who I Oh, it's who I
[34:13] am.
[34:15] It's who I You're a good good father.

[34:27] morning.
[34:33] Good, good father to us this morning as
[34:37] brother Ron comes this morning. Casting
[34:40] all my cares on the father this morning.
[34:43] Casting all my cares. Let's sing that
[34:46] this morning. Casting all my cares. The
[34:48] greatest love story. So I'm casting all
[34:51] my cares on you.

[35:13] and full restoration.

[35:19] angels in a clown
[35:22] passed by. My redeemer's no longer dead.
[35:27] He's risen. And the greatest thing, he's
[35:31] coming back for you and me. Sing it this
[35:34] morning.

[37:05] praise this morning.
[37:11] Hallelujah.
[37:13] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[37:16] I love my father. Amen.
[37:20] Because he first loved me. That's right.
[37:24] Predestinated me.
[37:27] Put an elect seed in me.
[37:30] It was all about him. It wasn't about
[37:32] me.
[37:36] It's all about him.
[37:38] Hallelujah.
[37:40] And he's such a great father.
[37:44] It'll take an eternity. Yes. That's
[37:47] right. Amen. Amen. My mind cannot
[37:51] comprehend the things that God has got
[37:53] prepared for his people. Lord, heavenly
[37:56] father, as we come before you this
[38:00] morning, how we say within our hearts,
[38:05] Abba Father,
[38:07] how that our hearts are overflowing with
[38:10] your love
[38:13] and how, Father, that you have placed
[38:16] within us
[38:19] a seed of election.
[38:22] It wasn't of our works.
[38:26] It wasn't of how good we are, but it was
[38:29] because you made a promise. Thank you,
[38:31] Lord. You made a covenant. And Father,
[38:34] you keep your word. Yes, you do. Every
[38:38] man's word is a lie, but yours is truth.
[38:42] And we rely upon that. Therefore,
[38:44] Father, I ask you to come and break the
[38:47] bread of life to us this morning once
[38:49] again as we commit the service, Father,
[38:52] into thy hands,
[38:54] loving you and praising you for all that
[38:57] you've done and for all that you will do
[39:01] in Jesus Christ's name.
[39:04] Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you, musicians.
[39:07] Amen. Happy Father's Day to all of you.
[39:10] Greet you in the lovely name of Jesus
[39:12] Christ. Hallelujah.
[39:14] Amen. Not all those who are able to
[39:17] procreate seed are fathers.
[39:21] That's an elite title.
[39:24] Not all those who conceive are mothers.
[39:30] They are birthing people.
[39:33] Just Yeah. that that that's how they
[39:36] want to be recognized because they don't
[39:38] have that that valued title as a mother
[39:43] and as a father. Amen. And so uh also
[39:47] too today, I don't know if we announced
[39:49] Stephen and Emily Manard had their
[39:52] little baby uh this morning. So what I
[39:55] don't have the pictures, I don't have
[39:56] all the things. They sent me the
[39:58] details, but I'll wait till later to
[40:01] show you. They didn't send me a photo,
[40:02] so I don't know. Uh, it's a little boy.
[40:05] It's a little boy. So, happy Father's
[40:07] Day to to Stephen Menard and Emily. I
[40:10] mean, what a gift on a on a Father's
[40:12] Day, huh? You'll never forget that one.
[40:14] You That's like being born on Christmas.
[40:17] You get a Christmas gift. Yeah. What a
[40:20] What a time, huh? And, uh, Justice and
[40:24] Alyssa, God bless you. It's good to have
[40:26] our newly weds back here with us. God
[40:29] richly bless them. Let's just remain
[40:32] standing. turn directly to the word.
[40:34] Let's go to the book of Deuteronomy.
[40:38] Book of Deuteronomy.
[40:40] Got a little something on my heart this
[40:42] morning that the Lord as I was just in
[40:45] studying yesterday and he he took me in
[40:47] this direction. We're going to use this
[40:49] to perhaps launch off for a next couple
[40:52] services. Deuteronomy chapter 7 verses
[40:56] 1-9.
[40:58] Now, remember, we've been talking about
[41:00] Joshua, and we know that Joshua
[41:03] was called Moses minister. We know that
[41:06] Joshua was a man of war. Everywhere that
[41:08] you saw there was a battle, Joshua was
[41:11] in the midst of it. And so, he was a
[41:13] great man of war. And and we know that
[41:16] our God, he is a man of war. Amen. He's
[41:20] one that leads us into battle. So, we're
[41:23] going to parallel a little bit of the
[41:25] commission of Joshua, what he does and
[41:28] how he goes in and he takes the land and
[41:31] he brings to the people their
[41:32] inheritance.
[41:34] But their inheritance is something
[41:36] that's given to them, placed before him.
[41:38] Okay, this is where you belong, but they
[41:40] have to go possess it.
[41:44] It's not given to them. It's given to
[41:46] them as a promise, but then they've got
[41:48] to go and take it out of the greasy,
[41:50] grimy hands of the devil. You gotta
[41:52] fight for it.
[41:55] Yes, sir. Amen. So, you know, I I want
[41:59] you to all understand sometimes, you
[42:01] know, even the prophet said, a lot of
[42:03] times people think, well, coming to
[42:04] Christ and your battle's all over and
[42:06] and everything's good and you walk
[42:08] around on on a cloud all the time and
[42:11] and you just feel the love of God all
[42:13] and you love everybody and the devil,
[42:15] hey, he's way in the background anymore
[42:17] and he doesn't bother you, doesn't
[42:20] pester you. Listen, uh, you better
[42:23] understand that when you come to Christ,
[42:25] you have now entered a battle ground.
[42:28] That's right, Sister Perfect. You were
[42:30] singing about it. This fight that we
[42:32] fight, we must fight a good fight. Not
[42:34] as one who beatth the air. Don't close
[42:37] your eyes and go into a fight like this
[42:39] because you're going to get knocked out.
[42:41] That's right. How? Amen.
[42:45] Then the only stars you'll see be the
[42:47] ones that you got knocked out.
[42:49] You won't see the star messenger.
[42:52] It is knocked out. God help us. You
[42:55] going to fight.
[42:58] Amen. Fight a good fight. Amen. Amen.
[43:02] All right. Praise the Lord. Are you
[43:05] happy this morning? Yes, sir. Amen. I
[43:08] am. I love being a Christian.
[43:10] Deuteronomy 7:es 1-9. Let me get my
[43:14] glasses here.
[43:16] Deuteronomy
[43:18] 7:es
[43:20] 1-9. And when the Lord thy God shall
[43:22] bring thee into the land,
[43:25] whether thou goest to possess it,
[43:29] and hath cast out many nations before
[43:31] thee, the Hittites, the Gegosites, and
[43:34] the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and
[43:36] the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
[43:39] Jebusites, seven nations greater,
[43:43] and mightier than thou.
[43:47] And when the Lord thy God shall deliver
[43:50] them before thee, thou shalt smite them,
[43:56] and utterly destroy them. Thou shalt
[43:58] make no covenant with them,
[44:01] nor show mercy unto them, neither shalt
[44:05] thou make marriages with them. Thy
[44:07] daughter thou shalt not give unto his
[44:11] son, nor his daughter shalt thou give
[44:14] unto thy son.
[44:16] Brother Bram said, "Under no condition
[44:18] should a believer marry an unbeliever."
[44:22] Amen. Amen.
[44:24] For they will turn away thy son from
[44:27] following me,
[44:29] that they may serve other gods.
[44:34] So will the anger of the Lord be kindled
[44:37] against you and destroy thee suddenly.
[44:41] But thus shall you deal with him.
[44:45] So here's he said, "You go in. Don't
[44:48] make a covenant with them. I want you to
[44:51] go there and here's how you're going to
[44:52] deal with them.
[44:55] I want you to hold hands with them and
[44:57] embrace them." No way. I want you to
[45:00] make friendship with them.
[45:06] And thus shall you deal with them. You
[45:08] shall destroy their altars,
[45:11] break down their images,
[45:14] cut down their groves, and burn their
[45:17] grave in images with fire. Amen. And
[45:20] here's why. Because thou art a holy
[45:23] people unto the Lord thy God. Amen. The
[45:26] Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a
[45:29] special people unto himself above all
[45:32] the people that are upon the face of the
[45:34] earth.
[45:37] The Lord did not set his love upon you,
[45:39] nor show choose you, because you were
[45:42] more in number than any people. For ye
[45:45] were the fewest of all people.
[45:49] But here's the reason why. But because
[45:51] he loved you. Thank you, Lord. Wow.
[45:56] For God
[45:58] so loved.
[45:59] And because he would keep the oath which
[46:03] he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the
[46:06] Lord brought you out with a mighty hand,
[46:08] and redeemed you out of the house of
[46:10] bondman, from the hand of Pharaoh, king
[46:12] of Egypt. Know therefore that the Lord
[46:15] thy God is God. He is God, the faithful
[46:19] God, which keepeth covenant and mercy
[46:22] with them that love him, keep his
[46:24] commandments to a thousand
[46:28] generations. Amen. Ephesians chapter 6.
[46:32] We know Ephesians is the book of Joshua
[46:35] in the New Testament.
[46:40] Ephesians chapter 6
[46:44] verses 10 through13.
[46:51] Finally, my brethren, be strong in the
[46:53] Lord
[46:55] and in the power of his might.
[47:01] Put on the whole armor of God that you
[47:03] may be able to stand against the ws of
[47:06] the devil. WS means trickery. Right?
[47:12] For we wrestle not against flesh and
[47:15] blood, but against principalities,
[47:16] against powers,
[47:18] against the rulers of the darkness of
[47:21] this world,
[47:22] against spiritual wickedness
[47:26] in high places.
[47:28] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[47:30] of God, that you may able to withstand
[47:33] in the evil day, and and having done all
[47:38] to stand right.
[47:42] Stand therefore having your loins gird
[47:44] about with the truth and having on the
[47:45] breastplate of righteousness. And it
[47:48] goes on, but I wanted to finish there
[47:50] with verse 13. Wherefore taking in you
[47:53] the whole armor of God that you might be
[47:55] able to withstand in evil day u having
[47:58] done all
[48:00] to stand. Amen. May God bless the
[48:03] reading of his word this morning. You
[48:04] may be seated in the presence of the
[48:07] Lord.
[48:09] Now,
[48:12] I want to title my sermon this morning.
[48:14] And I want all of you to listen quite
[48:17] carefully
[48:18] because we all rejoice about the open
[48:21] book. We rejoice about the revealed word
[48:24] of this hour. We rejoice and say, "Thank
[48:27] God, eating the book, taking it." And so
[48:30] on and so forth. And I believe all of
[48:32] that. I agree with all of that.
[48:36] But the opening of the seals
[48:40] is something far greater than perhaps
[48:42] you realize. Amen.
[48:45] So I want to title my sermon. I want you
[48:48] brethren to go ahead and put it up
[48:50] there. The revealing of the open book
[48:53] was a declaration of war.
[48:59] I'm going to show you that brother
[49:01] Brennham
[49:03] said that when a seal open
[49:06] it declares war. Amen.
[49:10] Amen.
[49:12] And I want to take a subject this
[49:14] morning of spiritual warfare of the end
[49:17] time.
[49:21] Now, we've been speaking about
[49:24] and been studying on the change of
[49:26] administration.
[49:29] We realize that God prepares us
[49:33] by showing us what is going to happen.
[49:37] We see what he's done in the past and we
[49:39] will therefore have an assurance of what
[49:41] he'll do in the future. Because God
[49:44] doesn't change his ways. He's the same
[49:46] yesterday, today, and forever. That's
[49:48] right.
[49:49] And so what he's done will give us a
[49:52] pattern of what he will do.
[49:55] So
[49:57] um
[49:59] we have been talking about this Joshua
[50:02] commission
[50:04] and what he's going to do and how that
[50:06] he goes into the land and causes Israel
[50:10] to possess the land. But all of the land
[50:14] that is given to them is already
[50:17] possessed.
[50:19] There are already inhabitants in there,
[50:23] the Gegosites and the Parizzites and all
[50:27] of the different ites that are there.
[50:31] And God just doesn't drive them out for
[50:34] them.
[50:36] They have to fight their own battles.
[50:41] Now, I want to become very, very serious
[50:44] with all of you. You have a battle that
[50:46] you are to fight.
[50:50] This is just not given to you. Every
[50:52] promise, everything that is your
[50:55] inheritance, you better get ready. You
[50:57] got to fight for it. Amen.
[51:00] So, you're not called to a picnic.
[51:02] That's right. This is serious business.
[51:06] So, I want to show you in the first
[51:09] seal,
[51:11] Brother Bram said, "Here's the plan of
[51:13] it." Now, he's going to show you the
[51:15] whole plan of what God is doing, why
[51:17] he's doing it. So, we rejoice about the
[51:21] open book, the revealing of the seals.
[51:24] But here in the first seal, brother Re
[51:26] said, "Here's the plan of it." The first
[51:29] thing happens, there's an announcement
[51:32] in the heavens. First,
[51:34] what happened? A seal is opened.
[51:38] What is that? A mystery is unfolded.
[51:41] See, and when a mystery unfolds, then a
[51:44] trumpet sounds. So you see a heavenly
[51:48] declaration
[51:51] brings forth an announcement
[51:53] which brings forth a sounding of a
[51:56] trumpet. And what does it do? It
[51:59] declares war. Amen.
[52:03] Or a plague falls and a church age
[52:06] opens. See what is the war part? The
[52:09] angel of the church catches the mystery
[52:11] of God, not yet fully revealed. But when
[52:14] he does, he catches this mystery of God
[52:18] and then he goes forth to the people.
[52:20] After the mystery has been given to him,
[52:24] goes forth to the people. What does he
[52:27] uh do out there? He begins to proclaim
[52:32] that message. And what does it start?
[52:38] a war,
[52:41] a spiritual
[52:43] war. Amen.
[52:46] So again, I want to
[52:49] emphasize something on you. Do not get
[52:51] it in your mind that everything is going
[52:53] to be easy. That's right. And
[52:58] yesterday there was a celebration
[53:02] of the first army in the United States
[53:06] 250 years ago. when Trump went ahead and
[53:09] had a parade of of of a bunch of them
[53:12] soldiers dressed in the image of battles
[53:17] fought
[53:19] first world war, second world war,
[53:20] Korean War, Vietnamese war
[53:25] and they had it was a parade about
[53:28] warfare
[53:31] and I just began to think you know that
[53:33] the now I didn't
[53:36] I didn't change my sermon or make it
[53:40] into the direction I'm going because of
[53:42] that. I just believe that what we're
[53:45] seeing around us because the Bible says
[53:48] there'll be wars and rumors of wars.
[53:50] Amen. And if you're going to fight a
[53:53] warfare, you got to have your army men
[53:55] trained. That's right. And so when you
[53:57] take the inductees or those who go into
[54:00] the army, whether they join or whether
[54:03] they're drafted,
[54:06] there is a time of training which is the
[54:10] toughest of all training that they will
[54:12] go through. It's called boot camp.
[54:17] And they don't baby them. They don't
[54:19] pamper them.
[54:21] There is a drill sergeant that gets
[54:23] there and tells him, "I ain't your
[54:25] mama."
[54:27] That's right.
[54:29] And I'm telling you that I'm not going
[54:30] to treat you nicely. I'm going to tell
[54:32] you what to do. And you're going to say,
[54:34] "Sir, yes, sir." Amen.
[54:38] And when I tell you to move, you move.
[54:41] You're not going to sleep in.
[54:46] We're not going to baby you.
[54:50] So understand that the first amount of
[54:54] training for every Christian should be
[54:57] boot camp.
[55:00] Okay? Take away this imagery of well now
[55:03] it's over. I'm a Christian now. There's
[55:06] not going to be no battles. I'm going to
[55:08] tell booevil and he's going to run from
[55:10] me and no devil in hell's going to stop
[55:12] me and guess what? Everything and I'm
[55:14] going to get it. Oh, that's a fairy
[55:16] tale. Amen.
[55:18] You don't know the devil I face
[55:21] or you haven't. Brother Brennham said,
[55:23] "You better train for the conflict
[55:25] because the contest is on and you will
[55:27] meet him." That's right. So they began
[55:31] to to take those recruits and they begin
[55:34] to drill them through the exercises of
[55:37] war.
[55:41] because they need to be trained
[55:45] that when they go into war, they'll know
[55:48] what to do. Because when all hell breaks
[55:51] loose
[55:53] and there's mortars and there's live
[55:55] rounds and people are getting killed all
[55:58] around them,
[56:00] they need to know what to do and not
[56:02] just stand there and and get into a
[56:05] place of confusion. That's right. Right?
[56:08] So
[56:10] again, I've told you this is not being
[56:13] called to a picnic.
[56:17] You're called to war. Amen. And this is
[56:19] a time of spiritual warfare. And when
[56:22] you find out that the that Israel when
[56:24] they crossed over into the promised
[56:26] land, you would think the promised land
[56:28] flowing with milk and honey and
[56:30] everything was going to be great.
[56:33] That when they get over there, there's
[56:34] no battles. Wow. God gave us a land.
[56:37] Come on, give me my land. You guys that
[56:40] are on it, you GGites and everything,
[56:42] hey, I want my land. They said, "Ha,
[56:45] come and take it."
[56:50] They're going to be in your face.
[56:52] They're going to tell you, "Yeah,
[56:55] you and what army?"
[56:59] Amen. Now, brother Brennham says, "When
[57:01] the true church catches a true
[57:04] revelation," see, so much of the time
[57:06] this quote is misqued and
[57:08] overemphasized. When she catches a true
[57:10] revelation, who she is, hallelujah,
[57:12] she'll stand as an invincible army. But
[57:15] also quote the rest of the quote.
[57:18] He says that when they begin to discern
[57:21] and withstand the two spirits within
[57:26] the framework of the church,
[57:31] How many know that twins
[57:34] have been birthed under this revival
[57:37] that we call the message of the hour?
[57:40] Twins. They look good. They look like
[57:42] they're real.
[57:47] Spiritual
[57:49] warfare.
[57:52] So
[57:54] they had to go and fight for the land
[57:57] that was given to them. So do you.
[58:00] You're not exempt.
[58:02] You're not without your battles.
[58:05] Greatest battle ever fought today
[58:09] is in the mind. That's right.
[58:13] Therefore, we need to get away from
[58:15] being carnally minded because that's
[58:17] eminent with God. Amen. Amen. We need to
[58:20] be spiritually minded that we must have
[58:22] the very mind of Christ.
[58:26] Because when you have the mind of
[58:27] Christ, you know what to do with the
[58:28] word, how to do it, and when to do it.
[58:31] Amen. Amen.
[58:35] So,
[58:37] every believer must take heed to this
[58:39] this morning. And now I'm just going to
[58:42] substantiate. We do a little bit of um
[58:46] reading here.
[58:49] This morning
[58:52] in the sermon God in his word 1957, I'm
[58:55] going to read just the highlighted
[58:57] portion. And God told Moses down in
[59:00] Egypt land, he said, "I have given you
[59:04] Palestine."
[59:06] That's a good lesson right there for a
[59:09] minute. God's word said to Moses,
[59:13] God could have went up there and shued
[59:17] every one of them Philistines and so
[59:19] forth out and that said, "Come over.
[59:23] Come on, Moses. Just come up and sit
[59:26] down and take it easy." Doesn't that
[59:29] sound good?
[59:31] Huh? Mo most of us are amen to that,
[59:34] brother. Yeah, man. let me sit in my
[59:36] easy chair because God's going to do all
[59:38] the work and man, no fighting and I
[59:41] don't want to fight.
[59:45] But Moses and Joshua and Israelites had
[59:48] to fight for every inch of ground they
[59:51] got. And every promise in the book is
[59:53] yours.
[59:55] But
[59:58] man, it's one of those words that you
[1:00:00] better watch the fine line.
[1:00:03] But
[1:00:05] God will never give it to you
[1:00:08] and you lay back on a bed of ease. You
[1:00:12] have to fight for every inch you get.
[1:00:14] Amen. Now the Bible says that we are
[1:00:17] more than conquerors. We are more than
[1:00:19] able.
[1:00:20] And yes, we have a right. But we have to
[1:00:24] make sure that we understand our
[1:00:25] spiritual warfare because you can say
[1:00:28] boo to the devil. But if there's
[1:00:30] something in your life that is not right
[1:00:31] and you haven't repented of it, the
[1:00:34] brother Brennham said that devil has a
[1:00:35] right to stay right there.
[1:00:38] Huh? True. And you can be prayed for and
[1:00:41] an anointed with oil and guess what?
[1:00:43] That devil don't go nowhere.
[1:00:46] That's right.
[1:00:48] We kind of have taught and we've got a
[1:00:50] lot of our young people growing up now
[1:00:53] within the message that the cure all to
[1:00:56] all of your problems is a prayer line.
[1:00:59] We'll get all the ministers up here and
[1:01:02] then all of you will come through here
[1:01:04] and we'll pray for you and you'll cry
[1:01:06] and you'll boohoo and you'll feel a good
[1:01:08] feeling. And the ministry is telling you
[1:01:10] every devil's got to leave. I'm here
[1:01:13] under the authority of God and
[1:01:15] everything on and on and so people
[1:01:17] coming through.
[1:01:18] Oh God, I am so I am having such a hard
[1:01:22] time in my life. Oh God, deliver me from
[1:01:25] these Philistines.
[1:01:29] Wait a second. Repent. There it is.
[1:01:33] How many times
[1:01:37] do you know that repentance is before
[1:01:39] deliverance?
[1:01:41] That's right. Repent.
[1:01:44] That means turn from your ways. You shot
[1:01:47] yourself in the foot and you're wanting
[1:01:48] deliverance. Quit sinning.
[1:01:53] And when you quit your sinning, come
[1:01:55] forward. And you have a right.
[1:01:59] When you say, "God, I'm sorry. Forgive
[1:02:01] me." That's right. But if you come up
[1:02:04] here and you just want to be free from
[1:02:07] this Philistine that's bothering you or
[1:02:10] some kind of uh issue that you're having
[1:02:12] in your life and you just want to be
[1:02:14] free of it
[1:02:16] then and understand this. We as
[1:02:19] ministers have a right to cast out
[1:02:21] demons. We believe that. Amen. Okay. You
[1:02:25] can cast out devils. But what if that
[1:02:27] person has not repented in their heart?
[1:02:30] That demon goes out.
[1:02:32] That's right. He goes out and he he he
[1:02:35] waits. There's a time there's a p a time
[1:02:38] a dry season that when that spirit goes
[1:02:41] out he seeks others
[1:02:44] because he boohoo and cried and he said
[1:02:46] they cast me out.
[1:02:50] I don't like it. Come on big brother.
[1:02:53] What did he do to you?
[1:02:56] Huh?
[1:02:59] You know listen. It used to be you you
[1:03:01] used to fight somebody and when you
[1:03:04] licked them and you won the fight the
[1:03:06] battle was over
[1:03:08] but then you realize he's got a brother
[1:03:12] big brother he's got a uncle and he's
[1:03:14] got others and they come and they're
[1:03:16] going to challenge you
[1:03:20] okay? So you may win one fight,
[1:03:25] you may cast one devil out. Well, now
[1:03:27] you got seven others and you better know
[1:03:29] your spiritual warfare because if the
[1:03:31] house is not filled, somebody say
[1:03:33] filled. If the house is not filled and
[1:03:36] given the power and the knowledge about
[1:03:40] spiritual warfare, they become worse.
[1:03:45] Now the condition is, oh, but I went to
[1:03:47] the altar and I cried and spirit. Yeah,
[1:03:49] yeah, yeah. But listen, do you know
[1:03:51] spiritual warfare?
[1:03:54] So, we're going to go into this here to
[1:03:56] help you because you know what? I don't
[1:03:59] like losing anybody in battle. Amen.
[1:04:04] Okay.
[1:04:06] Psalms 24:8 says, "Who is the king of
[1:04:09] glory?
[1:04:11] The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord
[1:04:14] mighty in battle." Amen. Amen. In
[1:04:17] adoption, brother Bram said, "Our
[1:04:19] Ephesians, our Joshua, which is the Holy
[1:04:22] Spirit, our Ephesians, our Joshua is
[1:04:26] who?" The Holy Spirit.
[1:04:30] Joshua means Jesus savior. Joshua means
[1:04:33] the Holy Spirit represents it in the in
[1:04:37] the spiritual as that was in the natural
[1:04:42] that he is our great warrior. He's our
[1:04:46] great leader and God was with Joshua and
[1:04:49] so is God in the Holy Spirit moving us
[1:04:54] about. Do you understand our Joshua is
[1:04:57] the Holy Spirit?
[1:05:02] It means Jehovah Savior. So Joshua is a
[1:05:05] type,
[1:05:06] okay, of the Holy Spirit to the true
[1:05:09] believer.
[1:05:11] Who's being led
[1:05:14] and brought into all truth.
[1:05:20] But now let me just make a disclaimer
[1:05:23] here
[1:05:25] because there are many
[1:05:27] ones within the message
[1:05:32] or a few
[1:05:34] that have actually claimed and said we
[1:05:36] are the Joshua and Caleb. We're the ones
[1:05:39] that are going to take you over. Brother
[1:05:41] Brennham went so far he saw into the
[1:05:43] promised land but didn't cross you over.
[1:05:46] Prescott,
[1:05:48] Arizona was a good example of that with
[1:05:50] Leo Mercer and Jean Go. They actually
[1:05:52] told the people, "We are Joshua and
[1:05:54] Caleb.
[1:05:56] We're going to take you over into the
[1:05:58] promised land. You didn't get to
[1:05:59] fellowship with them. You didn't get to
[1:06:01] be a part of their park. You didn't get
[1:06:03] to come and be a part of them unless Leo
[1:06:06] and Jean received you into their camp."
[1:06:09] And the people there were under such a
[1:06:13] illusion,
[1:06:15] a deception that when they got off of
[1:06:19] the word and they got so far out
[1:06:24] that there was nobody that challenged
[1:06:26] them, why? And my friend who told me of
[1:06:29] the things that they had done, it
[1:06:30] actually caused me to get angry. And I
[1:06:33] told my friend, I said, "Why
[1:06:36] did you men allow this to happen when
[1:06:40] you know it's contrary to the word?"
[1:06:42] Amen. Brother Ron, I'll never forget
[1:06:46] what he told me. He said, "Brother Ron,
[1:06:47] we believe they were Joshua and Caleb."
[1:06:51] So why are we going to stand up against
[1:06:53] them? Well, let me just say this.
[1:06:58] When a spirit like that ever gets on
[1:07:01] you, you will absolutely believe it.
[1:07:05] And no matter if somebody comes to you
[1:07:07] with the word trying to show you, he
[1:07:10] said you won't believe it. And he,
[1:07:11] brother Brennham gives us this quote. He
[1:07:13] said, "It shows you're anointed with a
[1:07:15] wrong spirit."
[1:07:18] Because a right kind of spirit is
[1:07:20] teachable.
[1:07:23] You ever met a know-it-all in the
[1:07:25] message? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:07:26] Yeah. Well, brother brother Brent. Yeah.
[1:07:29] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All they want to
[1:07:31] do is debate. My days of debating with
[1:07:35] people and arguing about the word of God
[1:07:38] are over. I don't mind. Come now. Let us
[1:07:41] reason together. That's good. I think we
[1:07:43] good. We're good on that. I had a
[1:07:46] brother come to me here not long ago and
[1:07:48] he said, "Brother Ron, is it okay if we
[1:07:51] ask you questions?" Absolutely.
[1:07:54] Even if it's a doctrinal question. I'm
[1:07:57] so glad I had a brother in our church
[1:07:58] here the other day that that caught me
[1:08:01] saying something. And so he sent me a
[1:08:04] little text the in the next couple days
[1:08:06] and he said, "Brother Ron, I think you
[1:08:08] misqued what brother Oh man, I don't
[1:08:11] want to misquote. Maybe I do." And
[1:08:13] there's kind sometimes a slip of the
[1:08:15] tongue and he told me, he said, "You
[1:08:17] said uh you quoted that brother Brennan
[1:08:20] preached manifested sons of God." And I
[1:08:23] looked into the thing. Brother Brennham
[1:08:26] never preached the sermon.
[1:08:29] Wow.
[1:08:31] I want to Well, let's go in. Let's check
[1:08:34] because there's got to be an answer.
[1:08:37] Now, how many of you Now, I worked for
[1:08:39] Voice of God for several years, for five
[1:08:42] years over there in in Europe. And I had
[1:08:45] uh all of the tapes and I was putting
[1:08:47] them in chronological order. We had
[1:08:50] sometimes up to 10,000 cassettes and I
[1:08:52] would put them on the floor and I go
[1:08:54] from 1947. I put them in chronological
[1:08:57] order. And what was really amazing is
[1:08:59] looking at the sermon titles.
[1:09:02] So having uh done that I would read what
[1:09:05] this title. Well um if you understand
[1:09:09] that there were certain titles that were
[1:09:11] changed. Now let me give you an example.
[1:09:14] when we first came into the message and
[1:09:16] you ordered a tape from Fred Sauman that
[1:09:19] was called the great harlot.
[1:09:21] I I've got the tape in my home round
[1:09:24] realtore uh tape that says here's the
[1:09:27] sermon title the great harlot.
[1:09:30] Well, guess what brother Brennham never
[1:09:32] named the sermon the great harlot. He
[1:09:36] preached on why we are not a
[1:09:38] denomination
[1:09:40] or I can't maybe it was why I'm against
[1:09:42] organized religion one or the other but
[1:09:44] the whole time he's talking about
[1:09:46] Jezebel the great harlot.
[1:09:48] Okay. So later those were changed. Well
[1:09:52] I looked and I thought where did I get
[1:09:54] this? Because I had the quote that said
[1:09:56] manifested sons
[1:09:59] of God. And I thought oh wow I know what
[1:10:02] I did. I went back to a sermon I
[1:10:04] preached 20 years ago about
[1:10:06] manifestation and I found the quote and
[1:10:09] oh this is a good one. cut and paste and
[1:10:11] put it into uh my sermon. And guess
[1:10:15] what,
[1:10:17] brother Joseph Brennham
[1:10:20] in the meantime instead. How many of you
[1:10:22] remember Folio Views?
[1:10:25] Neil Holliva, do you remember that? That
[1:10:27] was our first search program within the
[1:10:30] message. So Neil Haliba and he would put
[1:10:34] in certain names and you could go and
[1:10:36] one of them was manifested sons of God.
[1:10:40] And uh then later when Joseph changed
[1:10:43] and took uh over uh the tapes in the
[1:10:46] books and he changed many of the names
[1:10:50] to what he had originally named it and
[1:10:54] it was called adoption part two.
[1:10:57] But when you go, so I took the index
[1:11:00] from Voice of God recordings and I
[1:11:02] looked up Did Brother Brennan preach
[1:11:04] manifested sons of God. Yes, here's the
[1:11:07] date,
[1:11:08] but the title is in the adoption series
[1:11:12] part two. The paragraph's the same, the
[1:11:16] quotes the same, but the name was
[1:11:18] different. So there are certain things
[1:11:21] and I thank the brother. I said, man,
[1:11:23] you do your homework.
[1:11:25] I am thankful. I don't mind you guys
[1:11:28] factchecking me.
[1:11:32] I'm not going to get mad at you. You How
[1:11:34] dare you? You're out of my church. I
[1:11:37] tell you, you can't believe what I said.
[1:11:39] Oh, stop it. That's nickel.
[1:11:43] That's right. We have a right. We have a
[1:11:45] We have a right one with another. Okay.
[1:11:48] To to Let's check. Did he really say it
[1:11:50] or did he not? Okay. So, that was good.
[1:11:53] And I told her, "Brother, thank you.
[1:11:55] Thank you. I'm glad you're listening.
[1:11:57] And and then when I shared with him, he
[1:11:59] said, "Oh, I'm glad you clarified it to
[1:12:01] me because I was kind of thinking
[1:12:05] my pastor."
[1:12:09] So, it's good. It's all good. I love it.
[1:12:11] That's okay. So, now listen. The Joshua
[1:12:15] commission that we're talking about is
[1:12:17] not a one-man individual.
[1:12:23] It's not a single person, but it is the
[1:12:27] ministry. Listen to me. This is very
[1:12:29] important that it is the ministry of the
[1:12:34] Holy Spirit bringing you to a place of
[1:12:37] adoption. So, it's him. Who's our
[1:12:39] Joshua? Holy Spirit. And what is he
[1:12:42] doing? He's leading you and guiding you
[1:12:45] into all truth.
[1:12:47] So adoption is the ministry of the
[1:12:51] pleasing of a son of God by the
[1:12:54] revelation that comes by way of the Holy
[1:12:58] Ghost because the Holy Ghost alone is
[1:13:01] the divine revealer of the word of God.
[1:13:04] We as ministers preach the word but he
[1:13:07] reveals it
[1:13:14] because we can take the Bible and we can
[1:13:17] read it. We can study from it but it's a
[1:13:20] coded message. It's encrypted.
[1:13:25] Not everybody Not everybody that reads
[1:13:27] it will see it. Amen.
[1:13:29] Not everybody that hears this message
[1:13:32] will catch the voice behind the veil.
[1:13:38] Do you do you see that?
[1:13:41] So he says it's only to an elect group
[1:13:44] of people that will have the ability to
[1:13:48] receive supernatural
[1:13:51] instruction. Hallelujah.
[1:13:53] Not comparing verse with verse, though
[1:13:56] that be good. But he said, "We need the
[1:13:59] we need the revelation of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:02] to you personally or you'll fail to get
[1:14:05] it." Amen. So, what kind of people are
[1:14:08] you? You are supernatural.
[1:14:11] You are you are uh you are ordained to
[1:14:14] get it. In fact, let me tell you, I'm
[1:14:15] not going to put a fear on you. I tell
[1:14:17] you what, you better believe everything
[1:14:19] I say. You because if you don't and you
[1:14:22] you're out. No, let me tell you. Let me
[1:14:25] just play the other side of the record.
[1:14:27] If you are predestinated,
[1:14:29] if you are ordained, if you are called
[1:14:32] of God, if you have an elect seed inside
[1:14:36] of you, you can't miss it. Thank you,
[1:14:39] Lord. Yes, sir. Somebody give him praise
[1:14:41] this morning.
[1:14:44] You
[1:14:46] can't
[1:14:48] miss it. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:14:52] That's the truth. Amen.
[1:14:54] I love that. So
[1:14:58] predestinated
[1:15:00] believers have the ability to hear what
[1:15:02] the spirit is saying to the church.
[1:15:06] They read between the lines.
[1:15:09] That's what brother Brennham said. Yes,
[1:15:10] sir. Yeah. He says now he says we look
[1:15:13] in the the story of Abraham and Sarah
[1:15:17] and he says and we see Sarah
[1:15:20] having a pagan king that looks at her.
[1:15:23] She's a 90year-old woman and says wow I
[1:15:28] have found the one I want to marry. He's
[1:15:31] got a kingdom. He's got all kinds of
[1:15:34] women.
[1:15:36] But he looks at Sarah and he wants her
[1:15:40] as wife. Now Abraham
[1:15:45] tells his wife, "Lie tell him I'm your
[1:15:47] brother. Will will you do that? Will you
[1:15:49] go to bat for me? Save my life." Can you
[1:15:52] imagine the little conversation in the
[1:15:54] back room? Are you kidding me, Abraham?
[1:15:58] Anyway, so
[1:16:01] brother Bram says, "Now watch."
[1:16:04] He says for the elect believer they read
[1:16:07] between the lines and see oh there had
[1:16:10] to be a change before the promised son
[1:16:13] came. So God was ch do you see read and
[1:16:16] we go wow that's amazing. Yes God
[1:16:21] changed them back because otherwise why
[1:16:23] would this king want to marry an old
[1:16:26] woman?
[1:16:28] You never see that happening.
[1:16:32] You see, the old man chooses
[1:16:36] a woman much younger than him.
[1:16:40] Huh? Amen.
[1:16:45] Anyway, I could go on and say something
[1:16:46] about that, but
[1:16:51] if you're 50, then go choose 225s.
[1:16:55] You never see a guy that's 50, 60, 70
[1:16:58] years old or something, you know, and he
[1:17:01] chooses a
[1:17:03] 81 year old.
[1:17:06] No.
[1:17:07] Anyway, anyway, goodness. Lord, help me
[1:17:10] here.
[1:17:13] Is it not true? That's right. We're even
[1:17:16] one of his own age.
[1:17:18] Anyway, in the sermon paradox 1965,
[1:17:21] let's get back onto the subject. The
[1:17:23] Joshua here is a type of the last day
[1:17:25] ministry. Wow. Joshua is a type of the
[1:17:29] last day ministry. See, now remember
[1:17:31] those three stages of the journey.
[1:17:33] First, the law and everything had uh to
[1:17:36] cease and he goes on and I don't want to
[1:17:39] disagree with the scholars. Uh but many
[1:17:42] hold that the promised land represents
[1:17:44] heaven.
[1:17:47] It could not represent heaven. It could
[1:17:50] not because they had wars and troubles
[1:17:52] and frustrations and everything in the
[1:17:55] promised land.
[1:17:58] I just exploded somebody's bubble.
[1:18:03] The promised land
[1:18:05] is your inheritance.
[1:18:09] Okay?
[1:18:12] But it's not going to be just given to
[1:18:13] you. You got to fight for it. Amen.
[1:18:17] So, it's not heaven. When we get in
[1:18:19] heaven, there's going to be no more
[1:18:21] battles.
[1:18:23] There going to be no crying, no sorrow.
[1:18:26] Won't that be good? Huh? And when we get
[1:18:29] up in heaven, we won't be sitting around
[1:18:31] uh on the clouds and playing harps and
[1:18:34] doing different things and then saying
[1:18:36] to one another, "Oh, do you remember
[1:18:38] loudia? It was so Oh, man. I tell you, I
[1:18:42] struggle every day. No, because when you
[1:18:47] enter into the kingdom, he shall wipe
[1:18:49] away
[1:18:51] all the tears from your eyes. Weep and
[1:18:55] sorrow no more. Enter now into the joys
[1:18:58] of the Lord. And when you get over
[1:19:01] there, you will be telling one another,
[1:19:04] "Hallelujah.
[1:19:05] It was him that overcame. I just went
[1:19:09] along with what he said. because he was
[1:19:12] in me. It wasn't me. It was Christ
[1:19:14] within me.
[1:19:17] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:19:22] So we are in a spiritual warfare. When
[1:19:25] the seals open, it declares war.
[1:19:30] So just as every church did since the
[1:19:35] time of Pentecost,
[1:19:39] I want you to understand that all of
[1:19:41] them fought for an inheritance.
[1:19:46] And I don't want to get ahead of myself,
[1:19:48] but I want you to understand that in the
[1:19:51] first church age,
[1:19:54] the Apostle Paul said, "I am a wise
[1:19:56] master builder.
[1:19:58] Let every man take heed how he builds
[1:20:00] thereon. And if any man thinks himself
[1:20:03] to be spiritual,
[1:20:06] he says he must declare what I've said
[1:20:09] is the word of the Lord. Amen. And if he
[1:20:11] speaks something contrary, let him be
[1:20:14] anma
[1:20:16] which cursed when he comes.
[1:20:19] Wow. What did he do? He started remember
[1:20:23] the first seal. What is it? The
[1:20:26] Antichrist riding on a white horse.
[1:20:30] He's got an arrow or a a bow with no
[1:20:33] arrows and he's riding down through the
[1:20:34] ages. What is Paul having to fight
[1:20:37] against? Antichrist spirit.
[1:20:41] Do you see what I'm saying? It starts a
[1:20:43] spiritual war. Just because Christ died
[1:20:46] on the cross doesn't mean that those
[1:20:49] Christians didn't fight for everything
[1:20:52] that in fact they were persecuted. They
[1:20:54] were hunted down.
[1:20:56] The disciples themselves were hung, were
[1:20:59] crucified, beheaded for what they
[1:21:02] believed.
[1:21:09] I believe that we have come, I declared
[1:21:12] this to you the other day. We have come
[1:21:14] to an appointed time. Amen.
[1:21:17] We are no longer an immature bride.
[1:21:21] We had our time when we were young.
[1:21:26] We were
[1:21:28] immature in our thinking. We were naive
[1:21:32] and everything. But you know what? We
[1:21:35] could not embrace the promise to our own
[1:21:37] bosom. So we passed it off. Well, it
[1:21:41] ain't happening with me. So why don't
[1:21:42] you go into Hagar?
[1:21:46] Those days are over. Amen. This mature
[1:21:49] bride is no longer passing this word of
[1:21:52] God to another woman. That's right.
[1:21:54] Amen. She is saying, "Be it unto me
[1:21:57] according to thy word." She's embracing
[1:22:00] the promise
[1:22:02] for her hour, and it's going to manifest
[1:22:06] the word for this hour. That's right.
[1:22:08] Amen. I believe that the bride has now
[1:22:11] approached the appointed time. It's
[1:22:15] happening around the world.
[1:22:17] They're catching the revelation.
[1:22:20] It's beyond what man is teaching. is
[1:22:22] beyond what the ministry within the
[1:22:24] message is teaching because it is the
[1:22:27] Joshua ministry of the Holy Spirit that
[1:22:31] is bringing us into our inheritance.
[1:22:34] So it doesn't matter whether you're from
[1:22:36] the Philippines or you're from the Congo
[1:22:39] or you're from Canada or from Mexico or
[1:22:43] anywhere.
[1:22:44] God is leading his people, his bride,
[1:22:49] his elect seed into the revealing of the
[1:22:52] son of man. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:22:56] it's happening to each one of you. And
[1:22:58] if it's not, let me say this,
[1:23:02] then the only category that you can put
[1:23:05] yourself in is foolish virgin. That's
[1:23:07] right.
[1:23:09] True. And you will see the tribulation.
[1:23:15] Because remember, foolish virgin woke up
[1:23:18] along with the wise virgin with behold
[1:23:22] the bridegroom cometh. Oh my, oh my,
[1:23:25] it's time to get ready. Uh uh let's go
[1:23:28] out to meet him. And they all went out
[1:23:30] to meet him, but the foolish had no oil,
[1:23:33] right? They had no Holy Spirit, right?
[1:23:36] Well, give us of your oil. Huh? Ain't no
[1:23:38] way. Amen. You go and buy. And while
[1:23:41] they went to buy, guess what? The door
[1:23:43] was closed.
[1:23:47] Oh God, don't allow any one of us here
[1:23:51] to miss the rapture
[1:23:54] or miss applying the token. Amen. To our
[1:23:57] homes. What is the token? Holy Spirit.
[1:24:01] Okay, I want you to understand there's
[1:24:03] an appointed time. Sarah had to come to
[1:24:06] an appointed time. Is that right? And
[1:24:08] then she receives power or strength to
[1:24:12] conceive seed. Mary had to come to an
[1:24:16] appointed time. Be it unto me according
[1:24:18] to thy word.
[1:24:20] Esther had to come to an appointed time.
[1:24:23] If I perish, I perish. But I'm going to
[1:24:26] go before the king. Amen.
[1:24:30] Ruth had to come to an appointed time.
[1:24:34] It was time of the threshing floor.
[1:24:37] Lay your self at his feet. Feed his
[1:24:40] possession.
[1:24:42] Who art thou?
[1:24:47] I'm Ruth,
[1:24:49] thy handmade.
[1:24:51] Rahab had to come to an appointed time.
[1:24:55] She had received
[1:24:57] some tape message believers into her
[1:25:00] home. How many you know brother Brim
[1:25:02] said it?
[1:25:04] Now I want to ask you, what are message
[1:25:07] believers doing hanging around a harlot?
[1:25:16] Don't you have a little question?
[1:25:18] Well, when you went into
[1:25:22] the city,
[1:25:24] where did you go? Well,
[1:25:27] uh, look, it's kind of a long story,
[1:25:31] but her name is Ray.
[1:25:33] I've heard about her. Isn't that the
[1:25:35] harlot? Uh, yeah.
[1:25:38] But I felt led. Yeah, I bet you did.
[1:25:42] Now, let's put the carnality aside and
[1:25:45] realize that hidden within
[1:25:49] the facade
[1:25:52] of a harlot
[1:25:54] is an elected.
[1:25:58] That pleased God when I said that.
[1:26:02] So the facade was but there these men
[1:26:05] had to have been led to go there and
[1:26:09] then she harbors those men in her home
[1:26:13] and when others want to try to get those
[1:26:16] messengers she lies.
[1:26:19] Christians don't lie.
[1:26:22] She lied. Well they went that way.
[1:26:27] So they go running off and soon as I
[1:26:32] love it
[1:26:34] and she said,
[1:26:36] "Watch your appointed time." Yes, sir. I
[1:26:40] require of thee a token. Amen. Because I
[1:26:44] know Joshua, the avenging angel,
[1:26:47] and we've heard of Joshua.
[1:26:50] We've heard what you guys do. Give us a
[1:26:53] promise.
[1:26:55] And they said, "I'll tell you what.
[1:26:58] We'll give you this scarlet thread, a
[1:27:00] type of the blood. We're going to give
[1:27:02] it to you.
[1:27:04] But I tell you, anyone who doesn't get
[1:27:06] under that scarlet thread, we're not
[1:27:09] responsible."
[1:27:11] You understand? That's why brother Ram
[1:27:13] said, "Get them in. Whatever you do, you
[1:27:16] get your kids in. Get them under the
[1:27:19] blood. Get them under the token."
[1:27:21] Hallelujah. And when a death angel
[1:27:24] passes,
[1:27:25] he'll pass over you.
[1:27:31] The bride is coming to the appointed
[1:27:33] time, sir.
[1:27:36] Is this the time? Yes, I've seen it.
[1:27:42] As I was with Moses, Brother Ram said,
[1:27:47] let me make sure. Yep.
[1:27:50] Joshua had faith in his own commission
[1:27:53] as Moses had faith. Now Rahab know that
[1:27:56] Joshua had this commission. She was
[1:28:00] aware of what he was doing and of his
[1:28:03] ministry. So now Joshua had the
[1:28:06] commission. Rahab recognized it before
[1:28:10] she seen anything. She know Joshua had
[1:28:13] the power of God that was going to take
[1:28:15] the land. And she asked for mercy and
[1:28:19] God granted her mercy.
[1:28:23] Wow.
[1:28:24] Rahab was a gentile.
[1:28:27] She is a type of the bride under the
[1:28:30] token. She'd heard about the ministry of
[1:28:32] Joshua.
[1:28:35] And she knew the power of God was with
[1:28:37] Joshua.
[1:28:39] And when she recognizes where the power
[1:28:42] is, she says, "Give me some of this
[1:28:45] power.
[1:28:47] Because I want to I want to preserve my
[1:28:52] family.
[1:28:54] Yes. How many of you are interested in
[1:28:56] your family?
[1:28:58] My kids and my kids' kids and Huh? I do.
[1:29:02] I'm interested. I have a legacy that I
[1:29:05] want to give to my children. I don't
[1:29:08] want just them to have rules and
[1:29:11] regulations.
[1:29:17] I just don't want them to be
[1:29:18] churchgoers.
[1:29:23] What good would it be to
[1:29:27] preach this gospel?
[1:29:29] None of my kids believe it.
[1:29:35] I don't know about you, but I want every
[1:29:38] one of them there.
[1:29:43] Now, if they're foolish,
[1:29:48] I cannot make them wise.
[1:29:52] You understand?
[1:29:54] They will pay for their foolishness. But
[1:29:57] I here's what I pray. God, at some time
[1:30:00] catch them,
[1:30:02] get a hold of them. Let them realize, oh
[1:30:06] my I've been out here living with with
[1:30:09] pigs, right? Amen.
[1:30:12] And the Bible says the prodigal son came
[1:30:14] to himself. I wonder what that was like.
[1:30:17] Well, what happened on that day? Did his
[1:30:20] theophony show up to him as he's there
[1:30:23] feeding the pigs and he's all dirty and
[1:30:25] and and said, "Hi, I'm your theophony.
[1:30:28] I'm your real true self. The part of you
[1:30:30] that never fell in the beginning and
[1:30:32] said, "Oh, hi self.
[1:30:35] What do I do now?" No. when he came to
[1:30:38] himself. In other words, when he saw
[1:30:40] himself,
[1:30:42] he needed
[1:30:44] to get right.
[1:30:51] He needed to get right himself. The
[1:30:56] Bible says in Romans 3:23, "For all have
[1:30:58] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:31:01] God."
[1:31:03] Romans 6:23 says, "For the wages of sin
[1:31:05] is death, but the gift of God is eternal
[1:31:08] life through Jesus Christ."
[1:31:11] So, you were born a sinner.
[1:31:17] You need to repent of the mere fact you
[1:31:21] were born in sin.
[1:31:25] Well,
[1:31:28] but don't I have to go out and smoke and
[1:31:30] drink and do all those things so that
[1:31:32] God can get a hold of me? Some of the
[1:31:34] hardest ones to convert within this
[1:31:36] message are those within
[1:31:40] our youth that have been raised up
[1:31:41] around it. That's right. Because I
[1:31:44] really have done nothing wrong. Either
[1:31:46] because they chose to do what mom and
[1:31:50] dad said. Okay. or they were forced.
[1:31:55] As long as you're in my house. Huh?
[1:32:02] That's what I kind of did. I have to
[1:32:04] admit.
[1:32:07] I put the law down. As long as you're in
[1:32:10] my home, okay? You will do as I tell you
[1:32:15] to do. And if you don't
[1:32:19] see, it was it was a a do or die.
[1:32:26] And you know what? If there's anything
[1:32:28] that I could do, I would love to maybe
[1:32:31] rewind
[1:32:35] and my first baby comes along and
[1:32:40] I don't whip on him so hard.
[1:32:45] your first one you really you learn
[1:32:47] lessons because you know I'm going to
[1:32:49] have a perfect baby
[1:32:52] you know you're going to do
[1:32:58] let me ask you overcorrection
[1:33:02] when they're just doing baby things
[1:33:05] they're doing childish things
[1:33:08] overcorrection the Bible says fathers
[1:33:12] be aware
[1:33:14] do not overcorrect your child because
[1:33:16] God will correct you the way you correct
[1:33:18] your children.
[1:33:21] Oh my.
[1:33:23] Okay. And a child often reproved
[1:33:27] hardeneth his neck. Yeah. Okay. You can
[1:33:30] beat me right now, Dad, because you're
[1:33:32] older than me and everything, but I
[1:33:34] resent.
[1:33:35] I hate you.
[1:33:38] They go into their bedroom and they cry
[1:33:40] and they say, "I hate that old man.
[1:33:44] He just won't let me be me.
[1:33:50] Dads,
[1:33:53] correct your children with love.
[1:33:59] Okay? Don't do it in your anger at the
[1:34:02] time of moment
[1:34:04] when you're so mad. Huh? Come here. I'll
[1:34:07] tell you. No. No.
[1:34:11] Go out. Pray.
[1:34:13] if you have time. If you don't, then
[1:34:15] beat them
[1:34:23] because sometimes at the moment you are
[1:34:25] just and if you're not prayed up
[1:34:28] yourself
[1:34:30] and they do foolish, childish things,
[1:34:35] you're going to try to reprove them and
[1:34:37] you're going to learn, son.
[1:34:40] Well, did not King David said,
[1:34:43] "Remember?"
[1:34:46] Say it louder. Remember not the sins of
[1:34:48] my youth. Oh,
[1:34:51] right.
[1:34:54] Did you do stupid things?
[1:34:56] Did you do foolish things?
[1:34:59] Did you step over the boundary when you
[1:35:01] knew the boundary?
[1:35:04] Of course you did. You're a kid. Yeah,
[1:35:07] kids do kid things.
[1:35:10] Like Steve
[1:35:13] coffee. People do people things. You
[1:35:16] know, that was a big revelation.
[1:35:18] Wow.
[1:35:20] So, here's one for all of you. Kids do
[1:35:22] kid things.
[1:35:25] They love loud exhaust.
[1:35:28] Hey, nowadays they go by me,
[1:35:33] man. And they've got they and and they
[1:35:36] drive by. It scares me. Scar me.
[1:35:42] If I could poof,
[1:35:44] get off the road.
[1:35:48] I remember we Okay. I had a Volkswagen.
[1:35:51] A Volkswagen
[1:35:53] has no power. It's not a speedster. It's
[1:35:56] not a a car that is known to go to the
[1:35:59] drag races. This is not Herby.
[1:36:02] Okay.
[1:36:04] It can't pull your hat off.
[1:36:08] But we put a we put a cyclone exhaust on
[1:36:12] that dual exhaust that came into a
[1:36:14] megaphone. You ever seen the megaphone?
[1:36:16] It comes out there like that. And man,
[1:36:18] it sounds like a a a real dragster.
[1:36:25] A Volkswagen.
[1:36:27] And I remember my brother, he love every
[1:36:29] time we went through a tunnel.
[1:36:33] Every time he saw girls crossing the
[1:36:34] road,
[1:36:37] until one day we're going coming back
[1:36:38] from the beach and girls crossing the
[1:36:40] road in their bikinis and
[1:36:48] you just redline this engine
[1:36:52] one too many times.
[1:36:56] What was it? foolishness.
[1:36:58] It was youth.
[1:37:00] When a guy went by me the other day and
[1:37:02] he had one of those loud things and I
[1:37:05] was just about ready to say, "I'll tell
[1:37:07] you what." And I get angry. I said,
[1:37:12] "I was there one day.
[1:37:15] I liked it loud."
[1:37:18] Huh?
[1:37:19] I wanted to be cool guy,
[1:37:22] right?
[1:37:24] How many of you wanted in your day like
[1:37:27] brother Brena I wanted to be big bad
[1:37:29] Bill
[1:37:31] huh
[1:37:32] let's face it until God
[1:37:35] gets a hold of you and now you're
[1:37:38] changed and the things which I once love
[1:37:41] now I hate and the things which I once
[1:37:42] hated now I love
[1:37:45] God changed you so your children the
[1:37:48] apple does not fall far from the tree
[1:37:52] right how Were you before you got
[1:37:55] converted?
[1:37:57] Then consider your kids. Very good.
[1:38:00] Okay.
[1:38:02] Yeah.
[1:38:03] That's why I look at some of our kids
[1:38:05] and I go, "You're going to have a hard
[1:38:06] time."
[1:38:10] Cuz I know your daddy.
[1:38:15] Come on now. Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:38:20] Yeah. Yeah.
[1:38:22] So God give us a heart then
[1:38:25] for our children that what we do is we
[1:38:29] love them
[1:38:31] even through their foolishness
[1:38:34] you understand that
[1:38:36] I hate the sin but I love the sinner
[1:38:40] now brother Bham says in this sermon
[1:38:42] here
[1:38:44] his unfailing words of promise how many
[1:38:47] remembers that he promised that it would
[1:38:48] be it would continue on he's talking
[1:38:51] about the third pole.
[1:38:54] Go ahead. Let's go to the highlighted.
[1:38:56] Oh, it it's not highlighted there, but
[1:38:58] it is here. How many remembers that he
[1:39:01] promised that it would continue on? He's
[1:39:03] talking about the third pull. I want you
[1:39:05] to understand that the third pull, the
[1:39:07] revealing of the word did not stop when
[1:39:09] the voice of Malachi 4 was silenced.
[1:39:13] No, it continues.
[1:39:16] It's going on to today. So that third
[1:39:18] pull, now watch. He said when I made the
[1:39:20] third pull, he says now don't tell
[1:39:22] anybody about this.
[1:39:24] You've been trying to explain that other
[1:39:26] don't tell nobody about this. This is
[1:39:29] the great and final pull. Hallelujah.
[1:39:33] We're going through the great and final
[1:39:36] climax. This is it. It's coming to a
[1:39:38] crescendo.
[1:39:40] You see, every great symphony has a
[1:39:44] crescendo.
[1:39:46] And we're coming to it. Amen. And the
[1:39:49] greatest conflict that's going on in the
[1:39:51] world today are two supernatural powers.
[1:39:55] The powers of darkness and the powers of
[1:39:58] light. Now, I want all of you to
[1:40:00] understand that the Bible says that the
[1:40:02] devil, Lucifer, is a mighty power.
[1:40:07] And I want all of you to understand that
[1:40:09] if you get out from behind the
[1:40:12] protection of the word, Amen.
[1:40:15] There can be a time when you get a
[1:40:17] stronghold in your life
[1:40:20] that you can't handle anymore cuz you
[1:40:24] open the door and you knew better. That
[1:40:27] woman that had been delivered from music
[1:40:30] and dancing was just crossing the road
[1:40:33] one day and she hears
[1:40:37] the little
[1:40:39] bar or dance floor a few doors down and
[1:40:42] she stops to listen to the music. Oh.
[1:40:47] Oh.
[1:40:49] And she found herself
[1:40:52] now in the arms of a man on the dance
[1:40:54] floor.
[1:40:55] How did it happen?
[1:40:58] She let down the bars.
[1:41:01] That's right. Okay. Are are we together
[1:41:03] on that? When you
[1:41:08] knowing better by the inner course of
[1:41:10] the mind, add to or take away or you
[1:41:13] justify or reason with the word of God.
[1:41:16] You have committed spiritual adultery on
[1:41:18] Christ the word. You've taken an unclean
[1:41:20] spirit. And and guess what? It's a
[1:41:23] spirit of fornication.
[1:41:25] Okay?
[1:41:27] And you're enticed and you're pulled
[1:41:30] away. And when you are enticed, it
[1:41:32] bringeth forth sin. And sin brings forth
[1:41:34] death. Are we not? The Bible says
[1:41:37] sometimes in our flesh, we are enticed
[1:41:41] and pulled away of our own lust.
[1:41:51] So this is a continuation
[1:41:54] of the third pole ministry. Well, I
[1:41:57] thought it was only brother Brandham.
[1:41:58] No, no, no, no.
[1:42:01] This continues.
[1:42:03] This is what I've been trying to show
[1:42:04] you. Every ministry has for every Paul,
[1:42:07] there's a Timothy.
[1:42:10] For every Moses, there's a Joshua.
[1:42:14] Do you understand? Every one of them,
[1:42:15] for every Elijah, there's an Elisha.
[1:42:18] So, it didn't stop right there. This
[1:42:21] ministry is going to continue because
[1:42:24] we're in a battle. Now, now let me tell
[1:42:26] you how God fortifies his army. You want
[1:42:30] to know? You want to be interested?
[1:42:32] Because we're in a battle and we better
[1:42:34] have a good army around us. We better
[1:42:36] know how to fight because if we don't,
[1:42:39] we will have casualties.
[1:42:44] So in the sermon putting on the whole
[1:42:46] armor of God 1962
[1:42:49] God fortified his army
[1:42:54] what with himself
[1:42:57] in the form of prophets,
[1:43:01] apostles, teachers, pastors. What is
[1:43:04] that? Ephesians 4. So God fortified his
[1:43:08] army.
[1:43:10] What did he do? What was God doing?
[1:43:13] Listen, did you ever think what the
[1:43:15] offices of the church is, it's God's
[1:43:19] dress?
[1:43:25] It's God's dress.
[1:43:29] Inside dress, an apostle, a prophet, a
[1:43:31] seer. For see, before Satan ever gets to
[1:43:34] it, done told it. What is it? God's
[1:43:36] dressed up in his church. Amen. These
[1:43:41] offices is God's dress wear. Amen.
[1:43:46] Somebody say dressear.
[1:43:48] This is God's dressear. It's what he
[1:43:50] puts on.
[1:43:51] When you see those offices, pastors,
[1:43:54] teachers, evangelists, what is that?
[1:43:56] That's God's dressear.
[1:44:00] God's presence, God's spirit. And if
[1:44:02] working through man and if that office
[1:44:06] denies any of this word, then it's not
[1:44:09] God.
[1:44:11] See, no, not that. That's that wolf in
[1:44:16] sheep's clothing. Watch that fellow.
[1:44:18] Beware of him.
[1:44:20] So, I want you to understand
[1:44:23] that if God has got his dressear, say
[1:44:26] what the tapes say, say what he says,
[1:44:31] instead of just saying, "Well, stay
[1:44:34] home, press play, don't go to church
[1:44:35] because he's our pastor."
[1:44:38] Do you understand?
[1:44:40] You've denied God's dressear.
[1:44:43] That's right.
[1:44:46] True.
[1:44:49] He said it. That's right.
[1:44:52] You understand? So if you take away
[1:44:54] God's dressear, guess what? You've taken
[1:44:55] away the fortification of the army.
[1:45:00] The Bible says, "Obey them that have the
[1:45:02] rule over you."
[1:45:04] I ain't having nobody rule over me. I
[1:45:06] tell you what, I'm going to do my thing.
[1:45:08] I'm going to press play. I'm gonna stay
[1:45:09] home. I'm going to do Home Depot stuff.
[1:45:14] Yeah. Huh? I'm gonna do it myself.
[1:45:18] Everybody, you know what? Home Depot,
[1:45:21] they sell all kinds of tools and stuff
[1:45:24] for people that are going to do it
[1:45:26] themselves. I ain't going to hire no
[1:45:28] contractor. I tell you what, I went and
[1:45:30] I was going to do something in my
[1:45:31] bathroom. And you know what? They told
[1:45:33] me it's going to cost me $1,600. I'm
[1:45:35] going to do it myself. So, they go out
[1:45:37] there, they buy the toilet, they buy the
[1:45:38] tile, they go in there, and they make a
[1:45:40] mess of it, and they tear it all up.
[1:45:42] Then they go hire the contractor, but
[1:45:44] they're out $1,000 for the
[1:45:49] because they want to do it themselves.
[1:45:51] Amen. I tell you what, I am convinced
[1:45:54] that Listen, if you need your roof
[1:45:56] fixed, get a roofer
[1:45:59] and not a guy who just hangs out in the
[1:46:01] shingle. I'm a roofer. No, you you make
[1:46:04] sure this guy's a specialist. He knows
[1:46:06] what he's doing, right?
[1:46:08] Because if you Anyway,
[1:46:12] I think you've got the picture. Amen.
[1:46:15] God fortified his army. How's he doing
[1:46:18] it? Yes, sir. Through his dressear.
[1:46:20] Okay.
[1:46:22] So, we never want to deny God's
[1:46:25] dressear.
[1:46:27] 1956, the resurrection of Jesus.
[1:46:31] Now, we have a great ministry out the
[1:46:33] the ministry of the forerunning of the
[1:46:36] coming of this ministry. that's coming
[1:46:38] on now. Remember, he's talking about
[1:46:40] there's going to be a change of
[1:46:41] administration.
[1:46:43] There's going to be a change of
[1:46:44] ministry.
[1:46:46] The great climax is at hand. The great
[1:46:48] warfare between the devil and God. It's
[1:46:52] going on and the scene is being set for
[1:46:57] the final front lines where the clash
[1:47:00] will come and God will reign and rule
[1:47:03] for the Lamb was with them overcome them
[1:47:06] for he's the Lord of lords and King of
[1:47:09] Kings and he will ride down every
[1:47:12] opposition.
[1:47:15] Amen.
[1:47:17] So you see, brother Bram saying, "I'm
[1:47:19] going to tell you the climax, this this
[1:47:22] final the final front lines,
[1:47:25] the final climax of this thing. It's
[1:47:29] coming down." You know where it's going
[1:47:31] to wind up? In your home.
[1:47:38] Because
[1:47:39] when Moses said, "Slay the lamb, take
[1:47:42] the blood."
[1:47:44] But every head of that household had to
[1:47:47] apply the blood because they were head
[1:47:50] of the house.
[1:47:53] God help us that all of our heads of
[1:47:55] houses, will apply the token. Not just
[1:47:59] say, "I agree with it." And there's no
[1:48:02] blood. Don't just say you agree with
[1:48:05] this message. Get into it. Amen. Amen.
[1:48:08] Or may I say this? Get the message in
[1:48:10] you. Amen. Because when the message is
[1:48:13] Christ, when Christ is in you, he's
[1:48:16] going to lead you and guide you into all
[1:48:18] truth. Amen. That's right.
[1:48:22] If we don't study the kind of warfare
[1:48:24] that we're going into right now and are
[1:48:27] presently in, you're going to be a
[1:48:29] casualty.
[1:48:31] Huh?
[1:48:34] Because you won't know how to fight.
[1:48:35] That's right. You're going to stick your
[1:48:37] head up out of the foxhole when there's
[1:48:39] all kinds of live rounds going
[1:48:42] and the captain says, "Get down." Well,
[1:48:50] huh? Why do you think they take the
[1:48:54] refresh recruits and they put them out
[1:48:56] there on the field and they crawl under
[1:48:58] barbed wire and they say, "Don't stick
[1:48:59] your head up because we got lied 50
[1:49:01] caliber."
[1:49:05] Huh? I tell you what, my face would be
[1:49:07] right against the ground. Yes, sir. I
[1:49:09] ain't going I believe I believe what the
[1:49:11] captain said, man. I ain't going to
[1:49:13] stick my head up. Huh? Where's that
[1:49:15] round coming?
[1:49:17] Huh? That's right. Keep your head down.
[1:49:21] Understand this battle is real. Amen.
[1:49:24] And any of you that think that the devil
[1:49:27] is not a mighty power.
[1:49:30] Right. Don't you dare open a a a thing
[1:49:34] called a stronghold.
[1:49:36] Well, I just listen to the wrong kind of
[1:49:38] music. I just look at the wrong kind of
[1:49:40] thing. I just go and, you know, I cut I
[1:49:44] trim a little bit of my hair. I wear a
[1:49:46] little bit of makeup.
[1:49:49] I just wear my dress a little on the
[1:49:51] marginal side.
[1:49:54] I want to ask you, how close to sin do
[1:49:56] you want to come?
[1:50:00] You want to be right on the edge.
[1:50:04] There's something about standing on the
[1:50:05] edge of a cliff that's like
[1:50:12] it's kind of exhilarating. Like getting
[1:50:15] out on thin ice. You guys ever done
[1:50:17] that? Huh?
[1:50:20] Crack
[1:50:25] crack
[1:50:27] until
[1:50:31] How many of you like to get out on thin
[1:50:33] ice?
[1:50:35] No. Get me on that solid ground. Amen.
[1:50:38] Get me as far away from that cracking
[1:50:42] ice and thin ice. Get me get me on solid
[1:50:44] ground. In fact, I don't want to get out
[1:50:46] there on thin ice. No. No. No. No.
[1:50:52] See, if we don't study and if I as
[1:50:56] a pastor of of a group of people and
[1:51:01] especially our young people, if I don't
[1:51:03] prepare you for war, you'll be our next
[1:51:06] casualty.
[1:51:09] Okay.
[1:51:11] So, brother Brandham said in God hiding
[1:51:14] himself in simplicity, it's just like an
[1:51:17] army going to fight.
[1:51:20] It's warfare. The greatest warfare is
[1:51:22] going on, it's a spiritual
[1:51:26] warfare. Amen.
[1:51:33] So, as just as I said,
[1:51:36] even as Trump said, "Well, we're
[1:51:38] celebrating 250 years of our first
[1:51:40] army."
[1:51:42] And that first army, they came out there
[1:51:43] and they had the little doough boy hats,
[1:51:46] the little flat ones, and and you know,
[1:51:48] they look kind of silly compared to our
[1:51:51] elite army green beret guys of today.
[1:51:56] But they went out there and they fought.
[1:51:59] Many of them died.
[1:52:01] Russell Wallace just sent me a a little
[1:52:04] text. He said, "Brother Ruon, we went
[1:52:05] through Italy and I happened to go to
[1:52:08] the coliseum
[1:52:10] and I stood on the ground
[1:52:13] where many of our brothers and sisters
[1:52:16] were martyed. They gave their lives.
[1:52:20] Their very blood was spilled right on
[1:52:22] this ground."
[1:52:24] And he says, "Oh, I I think of all of
[1:52:27] those
[1:52:29] that had given their lives.
[1:52:33] And he says, "Their names are forgotten.
[1:52:36] They were not written down." But he
[1:52:39] said, "You know what? They were not
[1:52:41] forgotten in God's eyes."
[1:52:43] And one of these days, my brother and
[1:52:46] sister, we're going to get to meet them.
[1:52:48] Amen. Yes, sir. My name is Soandso.
[1:52:55] I was there during the Sardisian church
[1:52:57] age. It was there when 68 million
[1:53:03] were martyed.
[1:53:06] Wow.
[1:53:09] 68 million. Now, stop here for just a
[1:53:11] second. I'm going to rabbit trail for a
[1:53:14] moment. Do you see what's happening with
[1:53:17] Israel right now? Israel is striking
[1:53:20] Iran because Iran is an enemy. And they
[1:53:24] they do you think they want do you think
[1:53:27] they want peace
[1:53:29] with the Jews?
[1:53:31] They want to kill them, eradicate them.
[1:53:34] A good Jew is a dead Jew.
[1:53:38] So
[1:53:40] Israel said before we allow them to have
[1:53:43] nuclear weaponry, we're going to take
[1:53:45] out the ability for them. So they did
[1:53:48] these strategic strikes.
[1:53:51] Israel is trying to defend themselves.
[1:53:53] That's right.
[1:53:56] But this hatred that you see for the
[1:53:58] Jews
[1:54:02] is going to be escalated
[1:54:06] because you know what? They're going to
[1:54:07] martyr the 144,000.
[1:54:10] Yeah. This this this
[1:54:15] framework
[1:54:17] of what's going on right now that you
[1:54:19] see
[1:54:21] and this hatred and this hatred against
[1:54:25] law and order, how would you like to be
[1:54:27] a policeman?
[1:54:29] Huh?
[1:54:33] And why do you think illegal
[1:54:38] aliens who have come into this country?
[1:54:40] I want to ask you if we went down into
[1:54:42] Mexico and I went down to Mexico City
[1:54:44] and I said, "I hate America and I want
[1:54:47] to be a part of Mexico." And you know
[1:54:48] what? You people, I want you to put me
[1:54:51] in a nice hotel. I want you to feed me.
[1:54:53] I want you to give me free medical.
[1:54:57] Hey, ombre.
[1:54:59] Hey, Gringo.
[1:55:07] You ain't got no right.
[1:55:10] Try to do it in any other country.
[1:55:14] Raise your American flag and do that in
[1:55:16] another country and tell them to take
[1:55:17] care of you. It don't happen.
[1:55:22] So, what I'm saying is all of this stuff
[1:55:24] that's coming about because those who do
[1:55:27] evil are more protected.
[1:55:30] It's not the law-abiding citizens.
[1:55:34] Okay. So watch this. This whole system
[1:55:37] is coming down to something that is
[1:55:40] programming itself because the people
[1:55:43] are going completely insane.
[1:55:47] And you know what? Every time I look on
[1:55:49] the news, it gets worse. Can you say
[1:55:52] amen to that?
[1:55:54] So
[1:55:59] spiritual warfare.
[1:56:08] I'm going to say this
[1:56:11] that war is found all through the Bible.
[1:56:17] In fact, we're going to show you in the
[1:56:20] next couple services
[1:56:22] that the Bible says the Lord is a man of
[1:56:24] war.
[1:56:27] He is and he fights for his family.
[1:56:33] How many of you say, "I'll fight for my
[1:56:35] family." See, when it comes down to the
[1:56:38] home front, then we get real serious.
[1:56:40] When it's out there, hey, yeah. Oh, man.
[1:56:42] I hate to see what's happening. Let them
[1:56:45] do it to your kids.
[1:56:49] Let them do it to your wife.
[1:56:54] I've often said, "Oh, God, you know,
[1:56:56] because you know what? Um,
[1:56:58] I'm kind of jealous over my family and
[1:57:01] my kids and I don't want anybody fooling
[1:57:03] with them. And if somebody came into my
[1:57:05] house and wanted to harm my family, I've
[1:57:07] often said, "Oh, God,
[1:57:13] I don't know that I would stand back and
[1:57:15] just let them do what they want."
[1:57:22] Brother Ron, are you advocating? No. No,
[1:57:24] no, no. Don't put words in my mouth.
[1:57:27] I've often said, "God, you're going to
[1:57:28] have to
[1:57:30] restrain me
[1:57:33] because I'd get my hands on that
[1:57:36] uncircumcised Philistine
[1:57:41] and I cut his head
[1:57:44] off."
[1:57:48] I thought, "Thou shalt not kill." Wait a
[1:57:51] second. Wait a second. I'm going to take
[1:57:54] you back. And God says, "When you go in
[1:57:55] there and the Philistines and the
[1:57:56] Gegosites and the Parizzites and
[1:57:58] everything, I want you to kill every one
[1:58:00] of them.
[1:58:01] Every man, every woman, every suckling,
[1:58:04] every child, every camel and ass.
[1:58:10] Destroy them." Well,
[1:58:13] this little Gegosite, he's so cute.
[1:58:16] I like him. Look at him. Hey, goooo.
[1:58:21] Everybody loves little babies. It's
[1:58:23] amazing.
[1:58:25] And and women are the worst. They can be
[1:58:28] the ugliest little baby you have ever
[1:58:29] seen and go, "Oh, that is so cute. Look
[1:58:32] at that kid." I'm going,
[1:58:37] "Got to be kidding me."
[1:58:46] So
[1:58:48] those little Gegosites, those little
[1:58:50] parizzites,
[1:58:52] those little Hittites are going to grow
[1:58:54] up to be somebody that would like to put
[1:58:57] you away. Amen. That's right.
[1:59:01] So he said when you go in there I I
[1:59:04] don't want you to make peace with them
[1:59:08] nor let their son marry your daughter or
[1:59:10] your daughter their son etc
[1:59:13] because you'll create an illegal union
[1:59:16] because they will cause your son to go
[1:59:18] and serve strange gods.
[1:59:24] Now,
[1:59:26] the warfare started in heaven.
[1:59:29] And I've got so much of this that I'm
[1:59:31] just going to I'm going to give you a
[1:59:35] little tidbit of perhaps what I'm going
[1:59:37] to share with you on the next service.
[1:59:39] There are two prophets in the Old
[1:59:41] Testament that were called prophets of
[1:59:43] war.
[1:59:48] They are Jeremiah
[1:59:50] and Joel.
[1:59:53] And Jeremiah 6 verse4 says, "Prepare ye
[1:59:58] war against her."
[2:00:02] What did Jeremiah say? Prepare war.
[2:00:07] In Joel chapter 3
[2:00:10] verse 9, proclaim ye among the Gentiles,
[2:00:15] prepare war. Wake up the mighty men.
[2:00:19] Let all the men of war draw near. Listen
[2:00:22] and come up.
[2:00:24] So I want you to know that those men
[2:00:27] that are called to battle musicians if
[2:00:29] you come
[2:00:32] those men that are called to battle
[2:00:35] are called mighty men of valor. Amen.
[2:00:42] They are men who are mighty in battle.
[2:00:48] They are men that will not run.
[2:00:54] They are men that will not bow.
[2:01:05] Wake up the mighty men.
[2:01:10] What do you think these seals did?
[2:01:16] First seal.
[2:01:18] That's not Christ on a white horse.
[2:01:22] It's the Antichrist.
[2:01:26] Luther,
[2:01:28] when he broke the seal of his age, and
[2:01:31] the just
[2:01:33] shall live by faith, he proclaimed war
[2:01:37] against the Catholic Church. War in so
[2:01:40] much that everybody that sided with
[2:01:42] Luther were called Protestants.
[2:01:45] They protested. Amen.
[2:01:49] Along come Wesley.
[2:01:54] What did he do? He declared war.
[2:01:58] You must live a sanctified life.
[2:02:05] I've got the quotes I'm going to show
[2:02:07] you the Lord willing on the next couple
[2:02:09] things. But I want to uh I want I want
[2:02:12] to look at the spiritual warfare
[2:02:15] of the end time. What we're fighting
[2:02:17] against.
[2:02:20] If we're not careful, we fight the
[2:02:23] symptoms instead of the cause.
[2:02:27] [Music]
[2:02:29] Even I as a pastor, I've got to be
[2:02:31] careful. I don't go after the cut hair,
[2:02:40] the wrong kind of dress
[2:02:43] with an anger
[2:02:46] that's not seasoned with love. Amen.
[2:02:55] Because you can preach the letter of the
[2:02:57] law and the letter killth.
[2:03:00] Amen.
[2:03:02] So, how do I love my kids?
[2:03:06] How do I love them when they're doing
[2:03:08] wrong? I get on my knees and I go before
[2:03:11] the throne of God and say, "God,
[2:03:15] oh yeah, I would love to skin them."
[2:03:20] But, Father, they're yours. Amen.
[2:03:23] You correct them with nail scarred
[2:03:25] hands.
[2:03:28] You love them.
[2:03:30] [Music]
[2:03:34] If we're not careful, we as pastors,
[2:03:36] what we do is we let down the letter of
[2:03:38] the law to them
[2:03:42] and we conform them.
[2:03:50] We've done it.
[2:03:56] And if you don't learn by the
[2:03:59] lessons of others that have gone before
[2:04:01] you,
[2:04:03] [Music]
[2:04:05] even brother Brennham there at his home,
[2:04:06] he said, "I come home, the house all
[2:04:09] tore up. The wife's nervous. She's
[2:04:11] crying. Oh, Bill, you got to do
[2:04:13] something with these kids."
[2:04:16] Huh?
[2:04:18] Why, Bill, go over there and just beat
[2:04:20] them.
[2:04:22] I'm paraphrasing, but she wanted Bill to
[2:04:25] go correct him. He said, "Oh." He said,
[2:04:28] "They didn't really mean to do that."
[2:04:31] Oh, yeah. And she didn't like it. You
[2:04:33] know what she did? She got mad at
[2:04:34] Brother Bill. She slammed the door.
[2:04:38] Sister, sister, understand if your
[2:04:41] husband does something you don't like,
[2:04:45] be careful
[2:04:47] on how you act.
[2:04:50] [Music]
[2:04:51] But she was so flustered and everything.
[2:04:54] And Bill, you ought to take And he said,
[2:04:56] "Why, Joseph is such a mean little kid.
[2:04:59] He pulls the lamp off of the stand just
[2:05:02] to watch it break when it hits the
[2:05:04] floor." Any of you got a kid like that?
[2:05:10] I hope not. I had a sister tell me the
[2:05:13] other day, "Well, God gave me this this
[2:05:15] last little baby. It's the nicest. It's
[2:05:18] the this kid. God knew I needed this one
[2:05:22] because the first two I get to laughing
[2:05:25] with them.
[2:05:27] [Music]
[2:05:29] I'm sorry. I scared a few of you when I
[2:05:31] did.
[2:05:34] I needed one that'll go to bed when I
[2:05:36] tell them to go to bed. I needed one to
[2:05:39] shut up when I say shut up. I needed one
[2:05:43] that wasn't just a rebellious
[2:05:46] thing that
[2:05:53] God help us. Amen. We are called
[2:05:58] [Music]
[2:05:59] to a warfare.
[2:06:01] Now, we rejoice about this open book,
[2:06:03] don't we? Praise God. Let's take this
[2:06:05] open book. Let's eat it. And we become
[2:06:07] the bride and and we're going to go
[2:06:09] possess all of the gates and stuff. But
[2:06:11] do you realize what this this opening of
[2:06:13] the seals was? When a seal opened, it
[2:06:15] declared war.
[2:06:18] Because watch this life of brother
[2:06:21] Brennham. His whole ministry was coming
[2:06:24] up now. Okay, remember I I told you from
[2:06:28] the cross to the cloud. Two parts of
[2:06:32] redemption.
[2:06:34] Brother Brandham come out of
[2:06:36] denomination. And he's had all these
[2:06:37] years building up in his ministry.
[2:06:41] And he's coming to the place now, I'm
[2:06:43] telling you, that he said, "This word
[2:06:47] has become an offense to all the," oh,
[2:06:49] Bill, we loved you when you did the
[2:06:51] signs and wonders. Why you was a great
[2:06:53] man of God. In fact, nobody was offended
[2:06:55] at his ministry.
[2:06:57] Not one of the miracles he did did they
[2:06:59] say, "That's it. Blinded eyes open.
[2:07:02] Forget it."
[2:07:05] No.
[2:07:08] He said, "Except you eat of my flesh and
[2:07:09] drink of my blood." Oh,
[2:07:13] this is the third poll's an offensive
[2:07:16] poll. He said, "All the doors are
[2:07:18] closing me. Full gospel businessmen. I
[2:07:20] sit in Tucson.
[2:07:22] No one invites me."
[2:07:25] Wow.
[2:07:27] Are you kidding me?
[2:07:30] This is the climax of his ministry.
[2:07:33] This is him getting commissioned.
[2:07:37] He's not going off the scene. He thought
[2:07:38] God's going to take him off the scene.
[2:07:41] He's in Sabino Canyon. He's asking God,
[2:07:45] [Music]
[2:07:47] "Are you taking me home? It's okay."
[2:07:50] [Music]
[2:07:51] And God said, "No, this is the third
[2:07:53] pole.
[2:07:55] [Music]
[2:07:57] You mean you're not taking me off the
[2:07:58] scene?" "No, this is the vindication."
[2:08:02] He gets so excited he comes running down
[2:08:03] off the mountain. Mea I'm not going to
[2:08:05] die. It's vindication of my ministry.
[2:08:10] The vindication
[2:08:14] [Music]
[2:08:17] I thought over there in Africa that was
[2:08:19] a vindication.
[2:08:21] I thought in India with 300,000 or
[2:08:24] 500,000 people and at one time he's
[2:08:27] preaching to and they break their idols
[2:08:29] and and cast them down. And he said it
[2:08:31] was just a cloud everywhere.
[2:08:33] I thought that was a No, no, no.
[2:08:36] Remember, he was given two signs to get
[2:08:39] the people. What is the attraction?
[2:08:42] He said, you're going to pray for the
[2:08:44] sick.
[2:08:45] [Music]
[2:08:47] You're going to discern the hearts, but
[2:08:50] that's going to get the people's
[2:08:51] attention. Wow, this must be a man of
[2:08:55] God.
[2:08:57] So, they stopped to listen.
[2:09:00] He says, "Come out from among them.
[2:09:04] Be ye separate." What? Yes.
[2:09:08] What
[2:09:10] [Music]
[2:09:12] he said? Does this offend you?
[2:09:17] Then you realize, wow, Brother Brennan
[2:09:19] was saying, "Hey, listen. Denominational
[2:09:22] system, the system, not the people.
[2:09:25] Not the people." Brother Renham loved
[2:09:28] the people and hated the system because
[2:09:33] the system deceived them.
[2:09:38] There is a way the Bible says that
[2:09:40] seemth right unto men, but the end
[2:09:42] thereof is death. Amen. Amen.
[2:09:48] So
[2:09:51] I try my very best to give us a balanced
[2:09:54] gospel. Amen. I do.
[2:09:59] I see the failures of myself as a young
[2:10:02] believer
[2:10:04] and I know you know what I was too hard
[2:10:08] on my kids. I know that. I see it now.
[2:10:15] So, what can I do? I can't go back and
[2:10:18] fix it,
[2:10:21] but I can tell all of you. Don't you do
[2:10:24] that with your kids.
[2:10:26] My wife was such a good mother.
[2:10:29] Such a good mother. She comes from a
[2:10:31] family of 12 children and they had no
[2:10:34] plates and dishes and glasses that all
[2:10:36] looked alike because you know what? with
[2:10:38] 12 kids, they break and spill and and
[2:10:42] the the forks are different and
[2:10:46] and when Amos or Rebecca or Matthew
[2:10:50] spilt the milk or they did something and
[2:10:54] everything and I'd say and I got mad at
[2:10:57] them. You know what my wife said with
[2:11:00] her soft voice? Honey,
[2:11:04] they're just kids.
[2:11:08] They're just kids.
[2:11:10] So what?
[2:11:12] You should love them more than you love
[2:11:14] the milk. Amen.
[2:11:21] Does it resound home to any of you? Love
[2:11:24] the kid
[2:11:26] even through the foolishness of what
[2:11:29] they do. Kids will be kids and they're
[2:11:33] going to try you
[2:11:36] and they have to work out their own
[2:11:37] experience with God
[2:11:40] in fear and in trembling. Some will
[2:11:43] learn by the things you tell them
[2:11:46] and others
[2:11:49] they're hard learners. Some of them are
[2:11:51] going to be just as hard-headed, maybe
[2:11:53] thickerheaded than you were.
[2:11:58] So what I do is when it happens, you
[2:12:02] know what I do? I say, "Okay, God,
[2:12:05] I tried my way and
[2:12:08] I think I hardened their neck a little
[2:12:10] bit. So now they're yours.
[2:12:14] They're yours.
[2:12:18] Take the mess that I've made it
[2:12:22] and make it a message."
[2:12:24] Very good. appeal to their hearts.
[2:12:28] That's what I want to do. I want to
[2:12:30] appeal to every one of your hearts.
[2:12:33] That's the thing about brother Brandham.
[2:12:35] Oh,
[2:12:37] he loved
[2:12:41] he loved. Billy Paul told me, he said,
[2:12:43] "The greatest miracle
[2:12:45] that I saw daddy do.
[2:12:49] [Music]
[2:12:54] He treated
[2:12:57] his enemies as well as he did his
[2:12:59] friends.
[2:13:04] He said, "You couldn't tell the
[2:13:06] difference."
[2:13:08] Did not Jesus say, "Love your enemy.
[2:13:11] Do good to them that despitefully use
[2:13:13] you?"
[2:13:15] [Music]
[2:13:18] That's hard for me to do,
[2:13:21] huh? Because I'm I'm kind of
[2:13:24] You do this, you hit me, I'll hit you
[2:13:26] harder. You ever play that thing where
[2:13:28] you hit somebody on the shoulder and
[2:13:29] they turn around, they got to hit you
[2:13:30] harder, but pretty soon it's a ball.
[2:13:33] [Music]
[2:13:37] Lord, help us.
[2:13:40] You young men.
[2:13:42] [Music]
[2:13:47] Yeah. Yeah. You guys,
[2:13:53] I want to appeal to your heart.
[2:13:56] I don't want to lay down the law and
[2:13:58] say, "I'll tell you what you better."
[2:14:00] No, no, no. I want to say, "Hey, the way
[2:14:04] of a transgressor is hard."
[2:14:11] And if you're a son, you'll learn,
[2:14:16] right?
[2:14:18] Because Papa God is going to teach his
[2:14:20] son, right? Thank you, Lord. God, help
[2:14:23] us then with our children.
[2:14:26] How about appealing to their heart?
[2:14:29] I remember one pastor used to tell his
[2:14:31] kids before they went outside and
[2:14:37] went to I'm going over to Joe's house
[2:14:39] because we're we're going to shoot some
[2:14:41] hoops. They never went and shot hoops.
[2:14:43] They went to a movie.
[2:14:48] Well, Dad, we didn't want to tell you
[2:14:49] we're going to a movie because we knew
[2:14:51] you would say no. And we knew you'd yell
[2:14:52] and scream and throw and probably I'd
[2:14:54] get grounded. So, I I just went and did
[2:14:58] went to the movie anyway.
[2:15:00] See, if we're not careful, we make our
[2:15:02] kids programmed liars.
[2:15:05] Tell you what you want to hear,
[2:15:07] huh? Not what you don't want to hear.
[2:15:17] And he he said, "So what I tell my kids
[2:15:20] every time that they go out,
[2:15:23] I'm praying for you.
[2:15:26] Don't forget I'm praying for you." Oh,
[2:15:28] Dad, why did you have to say that?
[2:15:33] Because I can't even really go have a
[2:15:34] good time. It's What do you mean a good
[2:15:38] time?
[2:15:40] What's a good time?
[2:15:42] What is a good time? Ah, I went out and
[2:15:45] I got so drunk I vomited all over
[2:15:47] everything.
[2:15:49] I can't remember what I did. I passed
[2:15:52] out. You ever hear people in the world
[2:15:54] that way?
[2:15:57] I didn't even know what I did. Wow. Such
[2:16:00] a good No, no, no, no. That's nonsense.
[2:16:04] Why do you want to go get sick?
[2:16:07] No.
[2:16:09] Turn your heart over to God. Appeal to
[2:16:13] your heart, each one of you. Now, I
[2:16:15] haven't finished my sermon here, but
[2:16:17] I've made my point this morning that the
[2:16:19] opening of these seals, and we rejoice
[2:16:21] about it. Praise God. The seals are
[2:16:23] Christ and everything, but really, what
[2:16:26] did it declare? This seventh seal and
[2:16:29] this trumpet that this seventh angel
[2:16:31] message messenger gave to us said,
[2:16:36] "Prepare for war." Amen. Amen.
[2:16:41] He said, cuz it's coming. He said,
[2:16:43] there's coming an invasion of the USA.
[2:16:47] Any of you ever listen to that sermon?
[2:16:49] Go listen to it. He said they'll invade
[2:16:52] the US of A and they'll take it over
[2:16:54] without firing a shot. That's right.
[2:16:57] Because they'll put the wrong kind of
[2:16:58] leaders in there
[2:17:01] and they'll vote them in. And the next
[2:17:02] thing you know, how wow these people so
[2:17:06] far on the left, how did they get there?
[2:17:10] Because you know what? They went up
[2:17:12] there and they were voted in.
[2:17:15] And the next thing you know, well, wow.
[2:17:17] How did they make these laws?
[2:17:20] Well, I'll be honest with you. I never
[2:17:22] voted
[2:17:24] until the last couple election. I never
[2:17:26] vote. I could care less. I said, "Hey."
[2:17:28] But finally I said enough said enough.
[2:17:31] I'm going to try to vote for somebody
[2:17:33] that'll least stand up. Well,
[2:17:37] let me tell you the greater vote that
[2:17:38] I've done as I voted for Christ. Amen.
[2:17:42] This world, no matter how bad it gets
[2:17:44] and how far out it goes,
[2:17:48] that's why we better know how to fight
[2:17:52] this warfare in this end time or
[2:17:55] let me admonish you. Amen. Your kids got
[2:17:58] targets on them.
[2:18:01] Oh, you might be doing okay. You you you
[2:18:05] your prayer life and everything. You
[2:18:07] might be doing okay, but what about your
[2:18:09] kids? Huh?
[2:18:12] This little baby that Oh, man. God g
[2:18:16] such a cute little baby. Yeah. Pretty
[2:18:19] soon they start getting big
[2:18:22] and I growing up and I want a car and
[2:18:25] give it to me, Dad.
[2:18:28] Oh, sweetheart, you don't need I want
[2:18:30] it. I want to know
[2:18:36] make them brats
[2:18:42] and then they turn 16, 18, they got a
[2:18:44] car, they can go where they want, do
[2:18:47] what they want.
[2:18:50] If we haven't trained them up properly,
[2:18:54] huh?
[2:18:56] You understand? Amen. God help us. Cuz I
[2:19:00] want to save I want to save our kids.
[2:19:02] Amen. I want to save our adults. Amen. I
[2:19:06] want to preach to you truth. I want to
[2:19:07] tell you about the denominational system
[2:19:12] and how it's so deceitful.
[2:19:15] And I've got a sermon burning in my
[2:19:17] heart. I'll just give you
[2:19:20] a preview.
[2:19:22] I want to preach on
[2:19:24] the love of God.
[2:19:26] Then I want to preach on our love to
[2:19:29] God.
[2:19:31] Because you know what? Everybody loves
[2:19:32] the love of God, right? They all get
[2:19:35] together. Big concerts, big groups of
[2:19:39] people, big mega churches. Oh, God. God,
[2:19:43] he loves us. We're all going to heaven
[2:19:47] with our cut hair and our makeup and our
[2:19:49] shorts and our drinking and our
[2:19:52] adulteress and our divided families and
[2:19:56] divorce and on and on. When we all get
[2:20:00] there and they worship and they love God
[2:20:02] and God's anointing falls on them,
[2:20:06] it's the system and they love to talk
[2:20:09] about but what about if you love me
[2:20:14] you keep my commandments. Oh, no, no,
[2:20:16] no, no, no, no, no, no. I love God.
[2:20:21] And if God doesn't love me, even if I
[2:20:24] don't keep his commandments, then you
[2:20:26] have a Cain religion. If you don't
[2:20:29] accept my sacrifice,
[2:20:31] the sacrifice of my praise and of my
[2:20:34] lips, because you can you can praise God
[2:20:37] and worship him.
[2:20:40] But they that worship God must worship
[2:20:42] in spirit and in truth.
[2:20:45] You can you can have all kinds of
[2:20:47] worship, but if there's no truth, in
[2:20:49] vain do they worship me.
[2:20:52] Teaching for doctrine
[2:20:55] the commandments of men. You understand?
[2:20:59] Am I criticizing the people? God forbid.
[2:21:04] Because if it weren't for the fact that
[2:21:06] God opened my eyes,
[2:21:08] I'd be right there with him.
[2:21:11] Huh? I'd be right there in the
[2:21:14] denominational. In fact, probably it
[2:21:16] wouldn't even be in denomination of any
[2:21:18] kind. I'd be out there in the world just
[2:21:20] doing my thing, thinking that
[2:21:21] Christianity is a bunch of foolish
[2:21:23] people uh doing their thing and God is a
[2:21:27] figment of man's imagination and so on
[2:21:29] and forth and I would be going and doing
[2:21:32] my own thing.
[2:21:35] But God rich in mercy
[2:21:38] opened my eyes. Thank you Lord.
[2:21:44] I wanted to sing
[2:21:47] a song. I don't know what your plan, so
[2:21:49] I'm not going to name that tune, but I
[2:21:50] want to sing a song. I have a father
[2:21:55] because today's Father's Day. Amen.
[2:21:58] I'm thankful.
[2:22:01] I'm thankful I have a father. Amen.
[2:22:04] Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[2:22:10] And he calls me his own.
[2:22:19] [Music]
[2:22:23] I thank you, Father,
[2:22:27] and I love you.
[2:22:30] And I love you with all my heart and I
[2:22:32] adore you.
[2:22:35] I love your ways. I love your kingdom.
[2:22:38] Father, I believe. Help my unbelief.
[2:22:42] So, Father, as we worship you this
[2:22:45] morning, we take a moment here on this
[2:22:47] Father's Day. I I don't even know why I
[2:22:49] kind of went this direction, but I
[2:22:53] believe it's you, Father.
[2:22:56] My heart is turned towards you. And I
[2:23:01] want you to know I love this message.
[2:23:04] I'm not ashamed of it.
[2:23:11] I love it.
[2:23:14] And the more that I'm around
[2:23:17] the message, which is Christ, the more I
[2:23:20] love.
[2:23:22] Although I do have I have to admit with
[2:23:25] those that claim to follow this message
[2:23:28] because
[2:23:29] [Music]
[2:23:30] Paul said not every Jew
[2:23:35] is a real Jew but a Jew who's one
[2:23:38] inwardly.
[2:23:40] Amen. I want to be a real Jew. I want to
[2:23:44] be a real
[2:23:46] believer. Amen. And I want to worship
[2:23:49] him in spirit.
[2:23:52] And in truth, I have
[2:23:56] a father. Let's stand this morning.
[2:24:01] He calls me his own.
[2:24:05] [Music]
[2:24:07] He'll never
[2:24:10] leave me.
[2:24:13] No matter
[2:24:15] where I go, he knows my name.
[2:24:21] He knows
[2:24:23] my name.
[2:24:27] He knows
[2:24:29] my every thought.
[2:24:34] He sees each tear that falls
[2:24:39] and hears me when I call.
[2:24:47] I have a maker.
[2:24:54] He formed my
[2:24:56] heart
[2:25:00] before
[2:25:02] even time began.
[2:25:05] My life was in his hand. He knows my
[2:25:10] name.
[2:25:13] He knows
[2:25:15] my name.
[2:25:19] He knows
[2:25:21] my every thought.
[2:25:26] He sees each tear that falls
[2:25:31] and hears me when
[2:25:35] I have a father.
[2:25:39] I have a father.
[2:25:45] He calls me his own.
[2:25:51] He'll never
[2:25:54] leave me.
[2:25:56] No matter where
[2:26:00] he knows my name.
[2:26:04] He knows
[2:26:06] my name.
[2:26:08] Keep it. We'll keep it again.
[2:26:12] My every thought
[2:26:19] is here that
[2:26:23] hears me when I call.
[2:26:28] I'm amazed
[2:26:31] that you love me.
[2:26:35] I'm amazed
[2:26:38] how you care.
[2:26:42] Through your precious blood I found
[2:26:46] pardoned.
[2:26:48] And all my sins are washed. They're all
[2:26:53] washed away. All my sins are washed.
[2:26:59] Verse one. Verse one.
[2:27:04] How alone I was feeling
[2:27:09] and the emptiness I tried so hard to
[2:27:12] find.
[2:27:15] Though I laughed and said my life was
[2:27:19] fine without you.
[2:27:22] I was cut the secret tears I cried.
[2:27:29] Then one day, someone told me of your
[2:27:33] mercy,
[2:27:36] of the love you shown on a hill called
[2:27:39] Calvary.
[2:27:42] And there you
[2:27:45] purchase my redemption.
[2:27:49] when you broke sin's power and set my
[2:27:52] spirit free. I'm a man
[2:27:56] [Music]
[2:27:59] that you love me
[2:28:02] and I'm amazed
[2:28:06] how you care. Oh, you care. Through your
[2:28:10] precious blood, I found pardon.
[2:28:15] And all my sins are washed. They're all
[2:28:21] washed away. All my sins are washed
[2:28:26] away. Second verse.
[2:28:29] Yes, it's true. There have been days
[2:28:33] when I failed you,
[2:28:36] Lord. You know the many times I've gone
[2:28:40] astray.
[2:28:43] But I've learned your love is stronger
[2:28:46] than my weakness.
[2:28:48] Father's ear ear is open every time I
[2:28:54] pray.
[2:28:56] And no one else has ever cared for me
[2:29:00] like you. Oh, what a heart that he has.
[2:29:04] Prince of heaven is close to me.
[2:29:10] Not afraid to face the problems of why?
[2:29:14] Because knowing him when you are
[2:29:18] everything I've ever need. I'm amazed
[2:29:23] [Music]
[2:29:26] that you love me.
[2:29:33] Oh, how you care
[2:29:35] [Applause]
[2:29:36] through your precious blood I mouth and
[2:29:42] we thank you.
[2:29:44] Sins are washed. They're all washed
[2:29:48] away. All my sins are wash
[2:29:54] away.
[2:29:57] Are you thankful for that this morning?
[2:30:00] Think about his love.
[2:30:02] [Music]
[2:30:06] Think about his goodness.
[2:30:11] And think about his grace
[2:30:17] that's brought us through.
[2:30:24] For as high as the heavens above,
[2:30:31] so great is the measure of our father's
[2:30:38] love.
[2:30:42] Oh,
[2:30:44] great is the meure.
[2:30:48] Great is the measure of his love. Let's
[2:30:50] lift our hands and sing it this morning.
[2:30:53] Think about his love. Oh, think about
[2:30:56] his love.
[2:31:00] Oh, think about his goodness
[2:31:06] and think about his grace
[2:31:12] that's brought us through.
[2:31:16] [Music]
[2:31:19] For as high as the heavens above,
[2:31:27] so great is the measure
[2:31:30] of our father's
[2:31:33] love.
[2:31:38] So great,
[2:31:40] great. The measure
[2:31:43] of our father.
[2:31:47] Sing that last line one more time. So
[2:31:49] great it is. Oh great,
[2:31:54] great. Great is your measure of love.
[2:31:59] One more time. One more time. Great. Oh,
[2:32:02] you're so great. Oh, great is the
[2:32:07] measure
[2:32:08] of our father.
[2:32:14] Can we bow our hearts this morning,
[2:32:17] Lord? As that song says, great is the
[2:32:19] measure of your love.
[2:32:22] [Music]
[2:32:25] We're nobody's, but great is your
[2:32:28] measure of love for us, Lord.
[2:32:30] We thank you Lord for truth, freedom,
[2:32:36] war on every side, distress of nations,
[2:32:39] but we have love from the father.
[2:32:43] He's the king of the kings and lord of
[2:32:45] all, the captain of the host that's
[2:32:47] leading us in guidance, telling us
[2:32:49] truth, saying, "Hold up that shield of
[2:32:52] faith. Keep that sword in your hand.
[2:32:56] Fight the good fight of faith."
[2:32:59] How do we do it? We follow the footsteps
[2:33:01] of the Lord. Great is the measure of
[2:33:04] Father. We love you and we praise you.
[2:33:06] Bless Brother Ron today. Bless the ones
[2:33:07] that are sick and afflicted. Bless the
[2:33:09] heart surgery tomorrow. Lord, bless the
[2:33:11] other all the ones that are traveling.
[2:33:14] We have so many people traveling this
[2:33:16] weekend and the next several months, the
[2:33:18] two months for holidays, for people
[2:33:20] being out of school. We ask you to be
[2:33:22] with the ones as they travel. Thank you
[2:33:24] for your freedom to worship you today
[2:33:26] because there's some people around the
[2:33:28] world that don't have that freedom and
[2:33:30] we say thank you Lord that we have the
[2:33:32] freedom to come to church to lift our
[2:33:34] hands to lift our voices to praise and
[2:33:36] worship you.
[2:33:38] We thank you for that. We love you and
[2:33:40] we praise you and everyone said amen.
[2:33:42] Amen. It's been good to be in the house
[2:33:44] of the Lord. Happy Father's Day to all
[2:33:45] the dads. Uh the church would like to
[2:33:48] give each dad a little offering today.
[2:33:50] Just a little thank you. It's for you
[2:33:53] and you use it for yourself, but it's
[2:33:55] from the church. Yes, we support mission
[2:33:57] fields. Yes, we support people that are
[2:33:59] in need. We still do those things, but
[2:34:01] today the church and brother Ron would
[2:34:02] like to say happy Father's Day. Dads, we
[2:34:04] have a little gift for you. Go through
[2:34:05] the main door if you're a dad today and
[2:34:07] get your gift from there. God bless you.
[2:34:10] Remember service Wednesday night. Have a
[2:34:12] wonderful Father's Day. And to each and
[2:34:13] every one of you, God bless you. Amen.
