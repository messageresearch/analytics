[1:07:51] uh everyone it is just good to be here
[1:07:54] with you today it's such a pleasure I
[1:07:56] wonder if you would uh before we bow our
[1:07:58] heads let's read a passage of scripture
[1:08:00] if you don't mind
[1:08:01] so let's take our Bibles and read there
[1:08:03] wouldn't mind if you turn with me to the
[1:08:05] Book of John
[1:08:08] and I want to read in the um
[1:08:14] 17th chapter
[1:08:20] 17th chapter of the Book of John now
[1:08:23] this is one of uh
[1:08:25] one of if not the last this is one of
[1:08:28] the last prayers that Jesus prays
[1:08:31] and he's speaking to the Lord directly
[1:08:35] uh
[1:08:36] a lot of actually there's a lot of
[1:08:38] people who ask why did Jesus pray who
[1:08:40] did he pray to why did Jesus pray a lot
[1:08:41] of I've talked to a lot of
[1:08:42] denominational people and they'll say
[1:08:44] hey that's you know proof he's talking
[1:08:45] to God the father he's separating all
[1:08:47] these things I said well then why do we
[1:08:49] pray because the scripture says that
[1:08:50] it's Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:08:53] um he was praying to to the God that was
[1:08:56] in him he was God and he was praying and
[1:08:58] willingly submit himself to the word
[1:09:00] that was at work in him it's the same
[1:09:02] reason why we pray
[1:09:04] it's an amazing thing but he begins to
[1:09:06] pray in in verse 12.
[1:09:09] he's saying John chapter 17 verse 12
[1:09:13] while I was with them in the world
[1:09:16] I kept them in thy name and those that
[1:09:20] thou gave us me I have kept and none of
[1:09:23] them is lost but the Son of Perdition
[1:09:24] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[1:09:27] and now come I to thee and these things
[1:09:30] I speak in the world that they might
[1:09:33] have my joy fulfilled in themselves and
[1:09:36] I have given them Thy word and thy world
[1:09:39] hath created them and the world hath
[1:09:41] hated them
[1:09:42] because they are not of the world even
[1:09:45] as I am not of the world verse 15 and I
[1:09:48] pray not that thou shouldest take them
[1:09:50] out of the world
[1:09:52] but that thou shouldest keep him from
[1:09:54] evil
[1:09:55] and they are not of the world even as I
[1:09:57] am not of the world sanctify them
[1:09:59] through thy truth and thy word is truth
[1:10:01] as thou Hast sent me into the world even
[1:10:04] so I also sent them into the world
[1:10:08] and for their sakes I sanctify myself
[1:10:10] that they also might be Sanctified
[1:10:13] through the truth neither pray I for
[1:10:15] these alone but for them also which
[1:10:17] Shall Believe on me through their word
[1:10:19] that they all may be one
[1:10:22] as thou father art in me and I in thee
[1:10:26] and that they also may be one in US
[1:10:29] that the world may believe that thou has
[1:10:32] sent me
[1:10:33] in the glory which thou Hast gave us me
[1:10:35] I have given them that they may be one
[1:10:37] even as We Are One
[1:10:41] let's bow our heads and just pray
[1:10:44] Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful
[1:10:46] for the opportunity to gather into the
[1:10:49] to the to the just to gather into your
[1:10:52] presence
[1:10:53] as like-minded people
[1:10:56] Lord we're all pursuing the same thing I
[1:10:59] believe that deep down we all want the
[1:11:01] same thing
[1:11:02] and that's more of you
[1:11:04] so Lord we give this brief moment of
[1:11:07] time into your hands to do it as you
[1:11:08] please
[1:11:09] and I ask and I believe Lord but we ask
[1:11:12] because we know that you're here we know
[1:11:14] we believe that your presence is here
[1:11:16] we've gathered in your name so you
[1:11:18] promise that you'd be here
[1:11:19] but I ask that you'd speak to us however
[1:11:22] you would desire to to speak
[1:11:24] if you want to correct Lord make us
[1:11:27] willing to be corrected
[1:11:29] if you need to encourage us Lord then I
[1:11:30] pray may we be lifted up
[1:11:32] but may we have the courage to listen
[1:11:34] and to do what you want to say to us and
[1:11:37] so we give you that preeminence we give
[1:11:39] you that opportunity

[1:13:41] really care how
[1:13:43] I do care but I don't care as much about
[1:13:46] the delivery that I have I don't care if
[1:13:48] we walk away from this building and you
[1:13:49] think oh brother Stephen it's just a
[1:13:51] good speaker it's articulate he's just
[1:13:54] good
[1:13:55] I don't really care I would rather the
[1:13:58] Lord speak to us in whatever way he
[1:14:01] would choose
[1:14:02] and I I really feel that that's my
[1:14:04] heart's cry is that I I don't care if
[1:14:07] you think I'm smart or not doesn't
[1:14:10] matter at the end of the day it does not
[1:14:12] matter what matters is at this moment
[1:14:14] I've been trying to do this in my
[1:14:18] my older age
[1:14:19] uh I've been trying to live each moment
[1:14:23] to the fullest because God gave us this
[1:14:26] moment
[1:14:27] you you may be sitting here this morning
[1:14:29] you may be depressed
[1:14:31] you may be anxious you may have all
[1:14:34] these different life decisions going on
[1:14:35] many are the afflictions of the
[1:14:37] righteous we're going to have those
[1:14:38] until we're gone out of this world so
[1:14:40] mine will we might as well get used to
[1:14:43] dealing with problems and situations but
[1:14:45] this moment in particular God has given
[1:14:48] us and we'll never get it back that may
[1:14:50] seem like a little bit of a cliche but
[1:14:51] it's true
[1:14:52] this moment God has given each one of us
[1:14:55] in this room you have a choice of how
[1:14:57] you'll spend it I have a choice of how
[1:14:59] I'll spend it we have a choice in what
[1:15:01] name we lift up so brother Stephen
[1:15:03] coffee can go fish
[1:15:06] I don't really care
[1:15:07] we want to lift up the name of Christ
[1:15:10] not about me it's not it's not even it's
[1:15:13] not about anybody else it's about Jesus
[1:15:15] Christ and him lifted up but he cares
[1:15:18] about you he loves you
[1:15:20] I really believe that he loves you so
[1:15:22] much and so he set this order Apostolic
[1:15:25] order of preaching and it's foolishness
[1:15:28] to the world it's a foolish thing that
[1:15:31] we do to stand here and to sit there and
[1:15:33] listen to a guy spit in speech in all
[1:15:37] things for an hour it's very foolish
[1:15:38] thing but by that he would choose to
[1:15:41] save them that belief to that mechanism
[1:15:44] he speaks to you and he lifts you up
[1:15:46] hearing but Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:15:47] hearing by the word of God so as crazy
[1:15:49] as this is because this this is what
[1:15:52] we're used to this is what we do
[1:15:54] but to the world driving by they're
[1:15:56] thinking that's just crazy it's just
[1:15:58] weird and it is
[1:16:00] but by this
[1:16:02] the Lord would choose to lift you up
[1:16:04] he he can poke at you say hey I want you
[1:16:08] I want you to listen to this I need you
[1:16:10] to get this he can lift you up he can
[1:16:13] change you he can he can guide you and
[1:16:16] Lead You he can do all sorts of things
[1:16:19] if we give him half a chance
[1:16:22] so I say that let's do that today
[1:16:24] but you play a part in that so I'd ask
[1:16:26] you just to pull on the word of God
[1:16:29] let's just let's turn our attention to
[1:16:31] the word and let his name be lifted up
[1:16:33] can we do that
[1:16:35] amen
[1:16:37] you know I want to
[1:16:39] um
[1:16:39] I want to come back to this passage in
[1:16:42] John so keep your finger there
[1:16:44] I want to come back to it but I want to
[1:16:46] ask you a question
[1:16:47] I've been wrestling with with this
[1:16:48] question for quite a while and I'll be
[1:16:52] honest with you I'll be open and honest
[1:16:53] I'm still figuring out what it with the
[1:16:57] answer
[1:16:57] uh no I don't know everything
[1:17:01] uh I don't have all of the answers
[1:17:04] just I didn't know if you would know
[1:17:05] that or not so I just wanted to share
[1:17:07] that I don't know everything and I don't
[1:17:10] have all of the answers I've been
[1:17:12] wrestling with this question here's the
[1:17:13] question
[1:17:14] have you ever wondered why God confused
[1:17:17] all of the languages at the Tower of
[1:17:20] Babel
[1:17:22] why would he do that
[1:17:23] it's very simple it may seem like a very
[1:17:25] Sunday school type of answer and we can
[1:17:28] quickly say oh well you know he's
[1:17:30] confusing all the Earth they were
[1:17:31] building the big tower so they confuse
[1:17:32] the Earth and he scattered them all
[1:17:33] abroad you know all over the place
[1:17:36] so we can be you just assign that answer
[1:17:38] very quickly but I've just been
[1:17:39] wrestling with that question why did he
[1:17:42] do that so I would study for this
[1:17:43] service and sometimes as brother
[1:17:45] Ronaldo's telling you sometimes God will
[1:17:47] lead you and you'll just have just a
[1:17:48] thought you know drop in your heart and
[1:17:49] just all your notes will come together
[1:17:51] and things like that I I couldn't leave
[1:17:54] this question I just came kept coming
[1:17:56] back to it and kept coming back to it
[1:17:57] and I just thinking diff you know
[1:17:59] different directions and this is really
[1:18:01] this has really bothered me I'll say it
[1:18:03] like that why would God confuse all the
[1:18:06] languages at the Tower of Babel why not
[1:18:07] do something else why not
[1:18:09] um whatever it may be now I think the
[1:18:13] language part of it just to talk about
[1:18:15] that for a second we all speak the same
[1:18:17] language it's great right most of us
[1:18:19] will speak the same language some of us
[1:18:20] are listening through translators and I
[1:18:23] think translators are just some of the
[1:18:24] most amazing people on the face of the
[1:18:26] planet
[1:18:27] it's just amazing I think God uses them
[1:18:29] so monumentally
[1:18:31] but our sister Sarah and I were we had
[1:18:34] the privilege of going to visit a church
[1:18:36] in Tokyo a couple years ago and we rode
[1:18:38] the subway in Tokyo and you think New
[1:18:40] York City
[1:18:42] Subway was bad and I'm from rural North
[1:18:45] Carolina
[1:18:46] and so the subway is a hard thing for me
[1:18:47] anyways but then we get on the Tokyo
[1:18:49] subway and everything is in Japanese
[1:18:52] that was difficult
[1:18:54] it was very difficult so you're in a
[1:18:56] place where you don't speak the language
[1:18:58] it's hard for you to it's hard for you
[1:19:00] to get to where you want to go
[1:19:01] everything comes to a grinding Halt and
[1:19:04] that's that's just the way it goes when
[1:19:05] you don't have the right language I
[1:19:06] think also too even if you speak the
[1:19:09] same language you have a different
[1:19:10] dialect brother vasaki back there he's
[1:19:13] from rural Tennessee and people in
[1:19:15] Tennessee say they say Tennessee they
[1:19:17] don't say Tennessee
[1:19:18] uh you say Tennessee they say Tennessee
[1:19:21] so in the South you look at the
[1:19:23] different dialects and we all have
[1:19:24] different ways of of speaking and things
[1:19:26] like that I think you all speak the same
[1:19:28] out here
[1:19:29] uh I don't know but in the South we have
[1:19:32] different dialects of southern accent so
[1:19:34] you can be in West Virginia and they'll
[1:19:35] say well you get up in them heels and it
[1:19:37] is not up in them heels
[1:19:40] and then you move down further to where
[1:19:42] in Virginia and it's a little bit slower
[1:19:43] but yeah but you get up in them heels
[1:19:45] it's it's nice
[1:19:47] and then you go down to North Carolina
[1:19:48] and it's just it just slows down to you
[1:19:51] get up in them heels it is nice
[1:19:55] and then you go over a little bit to
[1:19:57] Tennessee where brother vasaki is from
[1:19:59] and it's appreciate you brother those
[1:20:01] those heels are nice
[1:20:03] and it's different accents but hey we
[1:20:05] understand each other
[1:20:07] you have different ways of speaking and
[1:20:08] all these different things
[1:20:10] I find it amazing that at one point on
[1:20:13] the planet we everyone spoke the same
[1:20:15] language so there was no barriers now
[1:20:16] there may have been cultural differences
[1:20:18] between the families and the parents uh
[1:20:21] you had all the different descendants of
[1:20:22] sham ham and japheth you had all of all
[1:20:25] of the variability within the family and
[1:20:28] the cultures that were there but
[1:20:29] everybody spoke the same language we're
[1:20:32] going back to that again in Zephaniah
[1:20:35] chapter 3 it says for then will I turn
[1:20:37] to the people of pure language that they
[1:20:40] may all call upon the name of the Lord
[1:20:42] to serve him with one consent
[1:20:45] so I began to realize if you go through
[1:20:48] the scripture and you begin to look at
[1:20:49] how important language is to the Lord he
[1:20:52] started out everybody with one language
[1:20:54] it wasn't just oh everybody should just
[1:20:56] speak the same language because it's
[1:20:57] easy there was intent because they could
[1:20:59] lift up their voice upon and call upon
[1:21:02] the name of the Lord with one consent so
[1:21:05] that was the intentionality behind one
[1:21:07] language so God confuses the language
[1:21:09] we'll go back to that at one point now
[1:21:11] in Genesis chapter 11 which is where God
[1:21:14] is is speaking about Babylon and he's
[1:21:16] speaking about
[1:21:18] um all the different things it says in
[1:21:21] the Hebrew
[1:21:22] that word he confused the language it's
[1:21:25] the origin of laughter it's uh the the
[1:21:29] feature of this I'm reading down just
[1:21:31] through the definitions in the Hebrew it
[1:21:33] says insulting Grimace place of the a
[1:21:36] bridle
[1:21:37] um a Divine speech quivering in Terror
[1:21:40] so when it describes the language it
[1:21:42] means a lot of different factors
[1:21:44] involved in it it wasn't just you know
[1:21:46] um I say hello and you understand hello
[1:21:48] or I say
[1:21:49] um hola and you say hola it was more
[1:21:51] than that it was understanding the the
[1:21:54] personality behind the language and the
[1:21:56] intent with which they spake so in the
[1:21:59] Hebrew that's what it meant the language
[1:22:02] and um I I I feel
[1:22:05] um when you look at this question of why
[1:22:08] God specifically chose the language
[1:22:11] um a few a few uh chapters before this
[1:22:15] God is saying I am done with Humanity
[1:22:18] I'm I'm done with Humanity the flood
[1:22:21] comes Enoch and and Noah find favor with
[1:22:24] the Lord
[1:22:25] and the flood comes and then they all
[1:22:28] come out of out of the Ark and they're
[1:22:30] there and shamham and japheth they go
[1:22:32] off and they uh begin to repopulate the
[1:22:35] Earth uh God says in in chapter nine I
[1:22:37] want you to go out into the Earth and
[1:22:39] repopulate it I want you to go in and
[1:22:41] regrow it so they go out and they begin
[1:22:43] to repopulate it but again they all
[1:22:45] speak one language so they were all kind
[1:22:47] of they were doing the same thing and
[1:22:50] then what happens is Nimrod who is the
[1:22:52] son of uh Kush and
[1:22:55] um the whole thing happens with ham and
[1:22:58] uh the curse was put upon Canaan and
[1:23:00] then cush was also the son of ham so
[1:23:03] Nimrod was the grandson of of uh Noah
[1:23:07] and you've got all this lineage and all
[1:23:08] these things happening and so Nimrod
[1:23:10] begins to assimilate a lot of people
[1:23:13] together into a unification so he he
[1:23:17] begins to get everybody together under
[1:23:20] the same purpose now it was it was
[1:23:22] interesting because he was easily able
[1:23:25] to get on everybody under the same
[1:23:27] attitude or under the Same Spirit or
[1:23:29] under the same
[1:23:32] systemization because everyone spoke the
[1:23:34] same language everybody understood one
[1:23:35] another but it wasn't just that they had
[1:23:37] the same vocabulary because they
[1:23:38] probably had different dialects and all
[1:23:40] these different things they were able to
[1:23:42] understand their intent
[1:23:44] so they were able with one consent to
[1:23:47] get behind the initiative that Nimrod
[1:23:50] set
[1:23:51] right if you think about it if I'm
[1:23:53] trying to get you involved in something
[1:23:55] if you
[1:23:56] um let's say I'm trying to communicate
[1:23:58] something to you and and you understand
[1:24:00] it in my language we can get behind that
[1:24:02] because you can comprehend it and
[1:24:04] understand it if we don't speak the same
[1:24:05] language and I don't understand you then
[1:24:07] it's harder for you to catch my intent
[1:24:09] and what I'm what uh what I'm
[1:24:10] understanding that's why I think that
[1:24:13] translators are just fast just amazing
[1:24:15] people in the kingdom of God because God
[1:24:17] will give them the intent of what the
[1:24:19] preacher says even though that may not
[1:24:21] be their initial language to me I'm
[1:24:23] thinking how on Earth do you translate
[1:24:25] the prophet of God but the holy spirit
[1:24:27] gives them the ability to do it and then
[1:24:29] there's people who are able to read what
[1:24:30] the prophet said in Kentucky English in
[1:24:33] their own language in kiswahili or
[1:24:34] whatever it may be that's an amazing
[1:24:36] thing to me now brother random teaches
[1:24:38] that
[1:24:39] um the the or the scripture brother
[1:24:41] random teaches of the scripture that the
[1:24:44] intent that Nimrod had was to build a
[1:24:46] name for themselves so they wanted to
[1:24:48] build a tower to the heavens and they
[1:24:50] had these certain kind of brick and all
[1:24:51] these different things but they want
[1:24:53] their intent was to make a name
[1:24:55] so they wanted everything to be
[1:24:57] underneath that name so it wasn't that
[1:24:59] we're going to make this name in
[1:25:01] defiance to God because the scripture
[1:25:02] doesn't say that what they did is that
[1:25:04] they made a name for themselves and the
[1:25:06] culture was a um a pluralistic culture
[1:25:10] in other words there was all kinds of
[1:25:12] idolatry that was happening in Babylon
[1:25:14] because that's the city that was there
[1:25:15] Babylon so brother Bannon would teach
[1:25:17] that the scripture says that Babylon did
[1:25:19] have a name for itself and it does have
[1:25:21] a name for itself spiritually right
[1:25:23] because you wind all the way up here
[1:25:25] today and you still have spiritual
[1:25:27] Babylon so they did make a name for
[1:25:29] themselves but it was almost a
[1:25:30] pluralistic society where you can have
[1:25:32] you can have idolatry over here you can
[1:25:34] believe this over here we can believe
[1:25:36] God as well we can believe all these
[1:25:37] different things but I want you to be
[1:25:39] unified behind this particular cause and
[1:25:42] so everybody comes down and everybody is
[1:25:44] doing that now the Lord said
[1:25:47] um in in the verses that um uh come out
[1:25:50] he says and the Lord said behold the
[1:25:53] people is one
[1:25:55] in other words they were unified so if
[1:25:57] you go down through the Hebrew I like
[1:25:58] studying the words and the Greek words
[1:26:00] and the Hebrew words partly because it
[1:26:02] makes me sound smart
[1:26:04] but just because you can gain a lot of
[1:26:06] perspective when you go down through
[1:26:08] those things and so the the word he says
[1:26:10] the people is one they are unified
[1:26:13] they're they've rallied behind this
[1:26:14] cause and they speak the same language
[1:26:17] so they can communicate it they
[1:26:18] understand each other's intent and they
[1:26:20] can get behind that very easily so the
[1:26:23] scripture shows that they did God says
[1:26:26] um uh uh behold the people is one they
[1:26:28] all have one language and they begin
[1:26:29] this they begin to do and now nothing
[1:26:32] this is interesting because God
[1:26:34] understands their potential
[1:26:37] that they have by their unification so
[1:26:39] they've got one language they've got one
[1:26:41] intent they've got one cause they're all
[1:26:43] rallied behind it and the Lord said we
[1:26:45] don't we didn't look at that and say
[1:26:47] that God said they can do anything they
[1:26:49] want to do
[1:26:51] amazing that God himself now just keep
[1:26:54] in mind that that a few chapters before
[1:26:56] the the Earth is still wet from the
[1:26:58] flood so he he had just taken Humanity
[1:27:02] off the face of the Earth and gave Grace
[1:27:04] to Noah and gave Grace to Enoch as a
[1:27:07] result but he he had just destroyed
[1:27:10] Humanity because his Spirit didn't
[1:27:12] strive with him so here again he is
[1:27:14] saying now they can do with this with
[1:27:17] this capability they can do anything
[1:27:19] they set out to do amazing
[1:27:22] Humanity can do a lot of things ever
[1:27:25] been below a skyscraper and looked up at
[1:27:27] it how on Earth do people do that it's
[1:27:30] amazing
[1:27:31] man is meant to achieve you want to
[1:27:33] achieve things brother Bannon would
[1:27:34] preach that many times he'd say mankind
[1:27:36] is they're just meant to do things
[1:27:37] they're just meant to achieve so we
[1:27:39] build skyscrapers we do all these things
[1:27:40] we build planes we by the grace of God
[1:27:43] we build planes we build automobiles we
[1:27:45] do all these different things technology
[1:27:46] advances men run to and fro and they do
[1:27:49] stuff
[1:27:50] you're with me knowledge increases so as
[1:27:52] men run to and fro and they do stuff
[1:27:53] they learn things and they adapt and
[1:27:56] they grow and they evolve
[1:27:58] and then things come about technology
[1:28:00] all these different things so he says
[1:28:02] they can do now nothing will be
[1:28:04] restrained from them
[1:28:06] and he says that they have imagined to
[1:28:10] do whatever they want to do they can
[1:28:11] just do it
[1:28:13] so he says let us
[1:28:15] confuse their language so he comes down
[1:28:18] and he confuses the language he
[1:28:20] literally separates the language apart
[1:28:22] so he creates a disunity
[1:28:25] now you might think well brother Steve I
[1:28:27] thought God was not the author of
[1:28:29] confusion
[1:28:30] but what he's doing is he's preventing
[1:28:33] Humanity from creating a greater sin
[1:28:35] when when Paul said that in Corinthians
[1:28:37] when he said God is not the author of
[1:28:39] confusion mankind was causing a disunity
[1:28:42] in the services that they were in so he
[1:28:44] said God is not the author what God sets
[1:28:46] forth to do he does not author confusion
[1:28:49] so he doesn't say yeah go and praise the
[1:28:51] Lord and have worship Services
[1:28:53] um because if we do that
[1:28:55] then you know there's some factions of
[1:28:57] that where they have snakes all up in
[1:28:59] the front and they toss the snakes up
[1:29:01] and they're called snake handlers so he
[1:29:04] doesn't say now just go and worship me
[1:29:05] and do whatever you want because we get
[1:29:07] craziness we get all different kinds of
[1:29:10] things so he says I want you to go and
[1:29:11] worship me and I'm going to fill you
[1:29:13] with my spirit and he'll lead you into
[1:29:14] the way that you should go so I want you
[1:29:16] to follow my word because I'm going to
[1:29:18] protect you and I'm going to keep you
[1:29:19] there's a lady in our church and she
[1:29:22] grew up in a snake handling church in
[1:29:23] the back Hills of Virginia and it was a
[1:29:26] total cult but they were they were
[1:29:28] worshiping the Lord they were worshiping
[1:29:30] the Lord and it was a total cult and
[1:29:32] they were tossing snakes up and they
[1:29:34] would let the snakes run all around the
[1:29:36] pulpit and people would
[1:29:38] um uh come up and if they get a wind of
[1:29:40] Faith they'd come up and grab the snake
[1:29:41] and throw it up she was a little girl
[1:29:43] little five six seven year old girl
[1:29:45] sitting in that sanctuary and said this
[1:29:47] is wrong there was something in her that
[1:29:51] let me just go ahead and say it she
[1:29:53] wasn't the same language wasn't there
[1:29:55] she wasn't speaking the same language
[1:29:57] she knew this is wrong there's something
[1:29:59] off here
[1:30:00] and so they're thinking oh we're
[1:30:01] worshiping Lord we're we're exactly
[1:30:03] where we need to be and the Lord said
[1:30:05] this is not what I had intended this is
[1:30:08] not what I said
[1:30:10] but they're saying oh no but he did
[1:30:12] because he said you take up serpents and
[1:30:14] they won't harm you and all these
[1:30:15] different things so they have they're
[1:30:16] listening to their own truth but they
[1:30:18] don't have they're not speaking the same
[1:30:20] language
[1:30:22] ever heard in business or
[1:30:24] um marriage where you're saying
[1:30:26] something and you just you're not
[1:30:27] getting it uh I don't have that problem
[1:30:29] I I don't I'm you may uh in your
[1:30:31] marriage where if you you're saying
[1:30:33] something or you're trying to get
[1:30:34] something across and you're just you're
[1:30:36] you're not it's not coming across or my
[1:30:39] wife is trying to tell me something that
[1:30:40] I desperately need to know and I'm just
[1:30:43] I'm just not getting it
[1:30:45] it's is you're not you we use the term
[1:30:48] you're not we're not speaking the same
[1:30:49] language you're not getting it you're
[1:30:51] not understanding it you're not
[1:30:52] comprehending it we're saying the same
[1:30:54] words we have the same vocabulary but
[1:30:56] I'm just not in I'm not catching the
[1:30:57] intent
[1:30:59] and now um that's exactly what was going
[1:31:01] on and so he changes their ability to
[1:31:04] communicate and breaks them apart so now
[1:31:06] these people with this language and this
[1:31:08] difference now they can't understand
[1:31:09] they can't get behind the same intention
[1:31:11] so he cause he allows the disunity to
[1:31:14] happen in other words they separate and
[1:31:16] they then they accomplish the word of
[1:31:18] God because he says go out into the
[1:31:20] world and and repopulate the earth I
[1:31:22] never said to come together and build
[1:31:24] this large city it says I want you to do
[1:31:26] what I asked you to do so to do it and
[1:31:29] and Nimrod pulls everybody together into
[1:31:32] a cause that is apart from that
[1:31:34] and so I I think they become unified
[1:31:37] behind that I think if those people if
[1:31:41] God was so intentional about having one
[1:31:43] language and then he he causes that
[1:31:45] disunity the the next time that the
[1:31:47] world uh will will be in that same kind
[1:31:49] of unification is in the full swing of
[1:31:52] the fourth horse rider right is when
[1:31:53] Satan has his full swing on the earth
[1:31:55] and everybody unifies around the
[1:31:57] Antichrist Spirit that's the next time
[1:31:59] that kind of unification will happen on
[1:32:01] the earth at that time we'll be speaking
[1:32:03] a different language
[1:32:05] praise be to God
[1:32:07] so until that time you have disunity on
[1:32:10] the earth and you won't have it like it
[1:32:12] was you just won't have it the Russians
[1:32:15] will the Russians will never see eye to
[1:32:17] eye with the with the Americans we'll
[1:32:20] never see eye to eye with the Iranians
[1:32:22] it's just you have disunity as a result
[1:32:25] of culture as a result of the intent
[1:32:28] that surrounds the language barrier
[1:32:30] you'll never have that but I began to
[1:32:32] think and as I ask myself that question
[1:32:34] why did God change the languages you
[1:32:37] begin to unfold to me if that's what
[1:32:39] they could do apart from the word of God
[1:32:42] imagine what people could do when they
[1:32:45] speak the same language of God and they
[1:32:47] unified together under that cause again
[1:32:50] because if he said if they spoke the
[1:32:52] same language and they were doing it
[1:32:54] against God and they nothing that they
[1:32:57] set out to do would be impossible for
[1:32:58] them
[1:32:59] then you begin to go back into what
[1:33:01] brother banham said and he said if we
[1:33:03] could all get in Harmony in that then
[1:33:06] the Rapture will go he said if we could
[1:33:08] all believe in the same way then there
[1:33:10] wouldn't be a sick one Among Us
[1:33:12] so I began to think what could it be if
[1:33:15] we all spoke the same language and we
[1:33:18] were able to come into Unity not the
[1:33:20] unity of our own cause or the cause of
[1:33:23] this church or the cause of this
[1:33:24] building or the cause of the cause of
[1:33:26] brother Ron or the cause of brother
[1:33:27] Steve
[1:33:29] but we all came under the cause of
[1:33:30] Christ and his Spirit lifted up imagine
[1:33:34] what could happen do you do you can you
[1:33:37] possibly imagine what could happen if we
[1:33:40] were all in the same vein of the Holy
[1:33:42] Spirit
[1:33:44] backslider uh no spiritual the one who's
[1:33:47] been in the message the longest the one
[1:33:49] who's been in the message the the the
[1:33:50] least if every single one of us
[1:33:53] regardless of respecting persons could
[1:33:55] be in the same vein in the Holy Spirit
[1:33:58] and he could deal where he wanted to
[1:34:00] deal change what he wanted to change
[1:34:03] I wonder what could happen
[1:34:05] it's an amazing thing to think about
[1:34:07] you know I also have learned I've been
[1:34:09] in the message all my life I grew up in
[1:34:11] a message church I've known the Lord for
[1:34:14] many years
[1:34:16] but I've grown up in message churches
[1:34:17] and I've realized this one thing that
[1:34:19] they're full of people
[1:34:22] and people
[1:34:24] are people
[1:34:28] they don't always uh that people don't
[1:34:31] always get along
[1:34:33] because people are people and when you
[1:34:36] have people that are people that hang
[1:34:39] around other people
[1:34:40] the fact that they are people
[1:34:43] causes problems
[1:34:45] and the fact that we'll never have the
[1:34:47] unity that they had of one language even
[1:34:50] if you speak the same language when
[1:34:52] people hang around people you have
[1:34:54] people problems
[1:34:59] and therein lies the issue and they're
[1:35:02] in disunity thrives
[1:35:04] when when Satan gets a toe hold and
[1:35:07] Satan moves in Satan has the ability to
[1:35:09] affect people you know you have a brain
[1:35:11] God created you with a brain and you
[1:35:14] have reason you have imagination you
[1:35:15] have all these different things so you
[1:35:17] can imagine to do something you can
[1:35:19] think about doing something and you can
[1:35:20] do it you can think in your career or
[1:35:22] you can think oh I'm going to build this
[1:35:23] house and you go and build it you do all
[1:35:25] these different things
[1:35:26] God gave you the ability to do that but
[1:35:28] Satan can use that as well Satan has
[1:35:30] Avenues to the spirit realm and he
[1:35:32] messes with your brain he's got the
[1:35:34] ability to mess with your mind God can
[1:35:36] God deals with your heart Satan deals
[1:35:39] with your mind so what happens is he he
[1:35:41] tries to get you to be thinking in a
[1:35:42] certain way you know you have memory you
[1:35:45] have conscience you have all of these
[1:35:47] different things and your memory is a is
[1:35:49] a is a real thing you have
[1:35:51] um it's uh it happens in your brain it's
[1:35:54] a physical thing it stays with you so
[1:35:56] even if you're saved and you're filled
[1:35:58] with the Holy Spirit you've been changed
[1:35:59] years later you can still think about
[1:36:02] what you did when you were a sinner
[1:36:04] because of memory it just it's your
[1:36:06] brain it's a physical thing so Satan can
[1:36:08] use that and say oh no no no no you you
[1:36:11] remember this way back here and then
[1:36:13] Satan can get in and he can use
[1:36:14] imagination and you can begin to imagine
[1:36:16] oh this is not really the way it is or
[1:36:18] this is not you know maybe I'm not as
[1:36:21] you know maybe I'm not maybe I'm I don't
[1:36:23] have the Holy Ghost right you could you
[1:36:25] you know the you know the drill Satan
[1:36:28] Satan uses that tactic against all of us
[1:36:30] and he begins to press now I'll say this
[1:36:32] I don't I don't want to ever have
[1:36:35] anybody thinking that they have the Holy
[1:36:37] Ghost when they don't
[1:36:38] but neither would I ever want somebody
[1:36:40] who has the Holy Ghost to doubt it
[1:36:43] when you have an experience with the
[1:36:44] Lord you know there's just something in
[1:36:46] you that you know he's changed you and
[1:36:48] he's he's molded you you don't have to
[1:36:50] doubt that and and uh God will never
[1:36:53] disbelieve himself so when you're sealed
[1:36:55] in there you're sealed in there I
[1:36:56] believe that nothing can take that away
[1:36:58] from you and there's an Evidence to that
[1:37:00] but I don't I don't um I don't think you
[1:37:03] have to doubt without a play around with
[1:37:04] with thoughts you can bring those into
[1:37:06] subjection of the Lord Jesus Christ Paul
[1:37:08] gives us the the ability he gives us the
[1:37:11] instruction on how to do it he says
[1:37:13] everything that sets itself against the
[1:37:15] knowledge of Christ bring it into
[1:37:16] subjection to to him so you bring those
[1:37:19] thoughts subject because it's not what
[1:37:22] goes into a man that defiles him or a
[1:37:24] woman it's what comes out so you can it
[1:37:27] can be thinking all different kinds of
[1:37:28] things and as we're talking to to the
[1:37:31] youth
[1:37:32] um that's what that's what Satan does
[1:37:34] he's really good at it he has nothing
[1:37:35] better to do with his time
[1:37:38] um he doesn't really have any other
[1:37:40] Hobbies that's what he does is he can
[1:37:41] mess with your mind
[1:37:43] so you need to understand that and even
[1:37:46] with things like depression and when you
[1:37:48] deal with depression and I've dealt with
[1:37:50] depression in my life and when you deal
[1:37:52] with depression it took me a long time
[1:37:54] to realize depression is worrying about
[1:37:55] something that has happened in the past
[1:37:57] in a very simplistic answer anxiety is
[1:37:59] oftentimes worried about something
[1:38:00] that's in the future right something
[1:38:01] that may or may not have happened so you
[1:38:03] can be depressed and anxious at the same
[1:38:06] time that is something that is rampant
[1:38:09] in in society is anxiety and depression
[1:38:12] so you can be dealing with depression
[1:38:13] when in actuality what's what depression
[1:38:16] is it can be an actual physical chemical
[1:38:18] imbalance right
[1:38:20] um it can be something that's actually
[1:38:22] physical but the Lord can deal with you
[1:38:24] with that he can help you he can he can
[1:38:27] allow you to overcome that I'm amazed at
[1:38:30] how many young people will cry
[1:38:31] themselves to sleep with anxiety because
[1:38:34] they just they don't know who you know
[1:38:36] is everyone is anyone ever going to
[1:38:37] marry me well yes that that may be what
[1:38:40] the Lord wants for you worrying about it
[1:38:43] and being in that constant state of fear
[1:38:45] is a is is of the devil he wants you to
[1:38:48] be in that state because God has
[1:38:50] something for you and he wants you to
[1:38:52] press into that he wants you to be
[1:38:54] unified uh into the cause of Christ so
[1:38:56] if you begin to think differently then
[1:38:59] you're going to wind yourself up in
[1:39:00] trouble down the road people can deal
[1:39:02] with depression and anxiety for years
[1:39:04] and years and years and not effectively
[1:39:07] deal with it maybe they don't know how
[1:39:08] how maybe they don't know how to uh
[1:39:10] answer they'll come to an altar again
[1:39:12] and again and again and and the preacher
[1:39:15] will say you you can be delivered of
[1:39:16] that and then they come and then they go
[1:39:18] home the next day right on Monday and
[1:39:21] they have to deal with the same
[1:39:22] circumstance that they left and that
[1:39:24] circumstance may be causing the
[1:39:26] depression so sometimes you have to deal
[1:39:28] with the circumstance in order to
[1:39:29] receive the Deliverance right in order
[1:39:31] to receive the the being made whole
[1:39:34] because it to to the leper that came
[1:39:36] back he said you've received your
[1:39:38] healing so did the other nine but I make
[1:39:41] the whole in other words he brings him
[1:39:43] into a whole uh new Deliverance of
[1:39:45] what's going on he makes him whole so
[1:39:47] that he doesn't have to deal with that
[1:39:49] anymore depression can can plague you
[1:39:52] and you you many times you have to learn
[1:39:54] Lord how do I bring that into subjection
[1:39:57] to you but there's power in that and
[1:40:00] there's power behind the Holy Spirit to
[1:40:01] deal with that but Satan can use your
[1:40:04] thoughts and get in your mind and mess
[1:40:05] with you that's what he does
[1:40:07] and so you you have to bring that into
[1:40:09] subjection now you can have imagination
[1:40:11] you can have all these different things
[1:40:12] but I God gave you those things so when
[1:40:16] brother Bannon was speaking about them
[1:40:17] and he said he Satan has five Avenues
[1:40:19] into the spirit realm God created each
[1:40:22] one of them
[1:40:23] Satan didn't create them God created
[1:40:25] them so God gave you an imagination
[1:40:28] God gave you the ability to critically
[1:40:30] think God gave you a conscience he gives
[1:40:33] you the ability to remember
[1:40:36] he he enables you the ability to hide
[1:40:39] the word in your heart so that you might
[1:40:41] not sin against him so God Gave You
[1:40:43] memory and you can use memory to the
[1:40:45] good you can switch around bad memories
[1:40:47] and say Lord you you allowed me to go to
[1:40:50] that horrible circumstance but I see
[1:40:53] what you've done through it and you can
[1:40:55] throw that in the devil's face and say
[1:40:57] Satan get thee behind me you shall not
[1:40:59] Prevail because the Lord took something
[1:41:01] that was ugly and he's made it into what
[1:41:03] it is today and praise be to God he's
[1:41:06] still changing me and I believe he'll
[1:41:08] still make something beautiful of it
[1:41:10] you may you may not feel like you're
[1:41:13] something beautiful but you are in the
[1:41:15] mind of God because he's still molding
[1:41:17] you and shaping you into whatever his
[1:41:20] image of beauty is for you
[1:41:22] and yours is not going to align with his
[1:41:24] so you need to align yours with his
[1:41:26] because you look at yourself every day
[1:41:29] and you know how you know how frail you
[1:41:31] are you know how messed up you can get
[1:41:34] and so if you look at that you're going
[1:41:36] to allow Satan to give you all kinds of
[1:41:37] things that you don't need to be
[1:41:38] thinking about when God said something
[1:41:40] completely different about you
[1:41:42] so align your thinking and your mind
[1:41:44] with his thoughts because your thoughts
[1:41:47] are not his thoughts
[1:41:49] to align yourself to his thinking
[1:41:51] you can imagine all these different
[1:41:53] things so I I wonder if we can all bring
[1:41:57] those things into the subjection of God
[1:42:00] what could he do with us
[1:42:03] I mean I'm just asking the question I
[1:42:05] think it's a fair challenge
[1:42:07] what could he do just in this room with
[1:42:09] us this morning if we could all just
[1:42:11] Lord I want to be in alignment with your
[1:42:13] spirit
[1:42:14] I want to be I want to be exactly where
[1:42:15] you want me to be right now
[1:42:17] you know you can you can receive the
[1:42:19] Holy Ghost even as I'm speaking to you
[1:42:22] you know that
[1:42:23] a birth is a mess
[1:42:26] but sometimes that mess can be uh a long
[1:42:29] period of time was for me but you can
[1:42:31] receive the holy spirit in an instant I
[1:42:34] believe you can
[1:42:35] while he yet spake they received the
[1:42:37] baptism of the Holy Spirit if you need
[1:42:40] life change you can receive it right now
[1:42:42] He's Able he's he's here dealing with
[1:42:46] each one of us and he can speak to you
[1:42:49] so you don't have to wait till the
[1:42:51] prayer line whatever it may be or
[1:42:53] however the Lord would choose to move he
[1:42:55] can do with you right now he wants that
[1:42:58] he wants to move you and to shape you
[1:42:59] and to mold you young people need to
[1:43:01] understand that the Lord can deal with
[1:43:03] you if you if you if you give him half a
[1:43:05] chance
[1:43:06] and so we have to be in that place of
[1:43:08] willingness that the Lord would move us
[1:43:10] and that the Lord would do this now
[1:43:12] here's the beauty of of being unified
[1:43:14] behind a cause of Christ is that you
[1:43:16] have to want it
[1:43:19] every dictator had followers
[1:43:22] every dictator has followers there's
[1:43:24] always going to be somebody to follow
[1:43:26] them
[1:43:27] Biden is going to have followers Trump
[1:43:29] is going to have followers who cares
[1:43:31] somebody's going to have followers
[1:43:32] there's always somebody there there's
[1:43:34] always somebody to come along behind it
[1:43:35] and get behind it you have a choice of
[1:43:38] what cause you get behind and I find and
[1:43:40] I fight this hard in in Even in our own
[1:43:43] assembly back home I I said I don't want
[1:43:46] you to be unified behind me I want you
[1:43:49] to be unified behind the cause of Christ
[1:43:51] because let's say you take brother Steve
[1:43:53] out of the picture who are you what
[1:43:55] cause are you behind are you just going
[1:43:57] to wander and hopefully find another
[1:43:58] church I don't want you unified to
[1:44:01] Brother Steve I want you unified to
[1:44:02] Christ to the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:05] Christ who is in our midst and he is the
[1:44:07] one who does the changing and the
[1:44:09] molding he is the one that should be
[1:44:11] doing the speaking so I don't want you
[1:44:13] aligned to Brother Steve I want you
[1:44:15] aligned to Christ let's lift his name up
[1:44:18] so it's not about me and my friends and
[1:44:21] this it's about him being lifted up and
[1:44:23] you need to align to that cause
[1:44:27] I don't I don't think it's good for you
[1:44:29] just to be in association with with an
[1:44:31] assembly it's never healthy for you to
[1:44:34] be so infatuated with the assembly that
[1:44:36] you're not actually in alignment with
[1:44:38] Christ
[1:44:39] what good is that going to do anybody
[1:44:41] now you'll play the part
[1:44:43] and you can oftentimes play the part
[1:44:45] really well I've known people for years
[1:44:48] and years and years in an assembly who
[1:44:50] are playing the part really well in
[1:44:52] other words they get behind they've got
[1:44:53] their shoulder uh behind that Ministry
[1:44:56] and pushing it and pushing it and
[1:44:57] pushing it as soon as somebody says
[1:44:59] something they don't like they are gone
[1:45:01] well this is not this is not this is not
[1:45:03] this and they they've you know pitter
[1:45:05] patter around back home I know we don't
[1:45:07] have it here but back home we have
[1:45:08] church hoppers
[1:45:10] and I'm not home so I can say it because
[1:45:12] I'm on the west coast so anything
[1:45:13] anything goes right
[1:45:15] uh back home we have church Hoppers and
[1:45:17] and you see these people and they're
[1:45:19] never settled
[1:45:20] they're never settled and I I feel like
[1:45:23] it's because they're seeking after
[1:45:24] individuals and not the cause of Christ
[1:45:26] and brother Branham said if we get
[1:45:28] people to the church we should be
[1:45:29] getting them to Christ
[1:45:32] I don't want to know what Paul or
[1:45:33] Apollos I want to know Christ and his
[1:45:35] name lifted up I want to know him in the
[1:45:37] power of his resurrection that's what I
[1:45:40] want to know
[1:45:41] and so people many times they'll pursue
[1:45:43] after individuals and then they'll get
[1:45:44] disappointed because people are people
[1:45:49] so if you get infatuated with me if you
[1:45:51] get infatuated with brother Ron brother
[1:45:53] Robert as amazing individual as he is
[1:45:56] you may be disappointed
[1:45:58] you may be disappointed
[1:46:01] it happens because people are people
[1:46:03] but through the foolishness of preaching
[1:46:05] God will put someone in your path that
[1:46:07] may just grab you by the lapels and
[1:46:09] Shake you a little bit and say hey I
[1:46:10] need you to listen up and then he may he
[1:46:12] may lead you over here he may lead you
[1:46:14] over here I I tell the people all the
[1:46:16] time
[1:46:17] um uh uh in our assembly I said I want
[1:46:20] you to be in a church where you're happy
[1:46:22] and you're fulfilled I want you to be in
[1:46:24] that I want you to be in that assembly
[1:46:26] if that's not here tell me and I'll help
[1:46:29] you move
[1:46:31] I will help pack you up and I will help
[1:46:32] move you to that church wherever the
[1:46:34] Lord is leading you you make sure that
[1:46:35] the Lord is leading you to that church
[1:46:37] and you make sure your reasoning is
[1:46:38] right but if he's leading you to that
[1:46:39] assembly and everybody was just you know
[1:46:41] like
[1:46:43] what and I never heard that before I
[1:46:46] said I want you to be where you are
[1:46:48] going to be spiritually Fed so if you
[1:46:50] feel like that's a church somewhere else
[1:46:51] go
[1:46:53] and I'll help you move I feel the same
[1:46:55] way I don't want I would never want to
[1:46:57] put my family
[1:46:59] somewhere where they would not be
[1:47:00] spiritually fed I want them to to be as
[1:47:03] fulfilled as they can be in the name of
[1:47:06] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:08] and so that's that's what we do as as
[1:47:10] Believers and we need to unify into that
[1:47:13] not just the assembly
[1:47:15] because you can be unified in the
[1:47:17] assembly and receive the benefit of
[1:47:20] being in the presence of God for the
[1:47:22] Bantam explain that all the time you
[1:47:24] under you understand many many different
[1:47:25] places you would say you can be in an
[1:47:27] assembly you can be and the rain falls
[1:47:29] on the just and the unjust so you can be
[1:47:31] in a really healthy assembly and
[1:47:34] actually not be anywhere you need to be
[1:47:36] with Christ you can be so far off from a
[1:47:39] personal relationship with the Lord that
[1:47:42] that that cultivates fellowship with the
[1:47:45] person of the Lord Jesus Christ you can
[1:47:47] be so far off of that and be so alive in
[1:47:49] the church
[1:47:50] be so filled and be a part of it and
[1:47:53] active and all these different things
[1:47:55] and be so far away from the presence of
[1:47:57] God what good does that do anybody
[1:48:00] God wants to fill you the unity between
[1:48:03] the church and the bride is not between
[1:48:05] the church or between Christ and some
[1:48:09] bride group it's between Christ and you
[1:48:13] you are the bride personalize it so
[1:48:16] don't say it's between me and the bride
[1:48:18] out there is between Christ and the
[1:48:19] bride out there as if you're outside of
[1:48:21] it he's come to you the voice of God is
[1:48:24] speaking to you in this day Christ this
[1:48:27] is who I am I want you
[1:48:30] that's what he's saying that's what the
[1:48:32] message of the hour is to me is the
[1:48:34] voice of God speaking to me
[1:48:37] and if he speaks to me he'll speak to
[1:48:39] you so don't sit yourself outside of the
[1:48:42] bride of Christ run into it and say Lord
[1:48:44] I want you to speak to me
[1:48:47] I need it personalized
[1:48:50] I don't want to be outside of it in an
[1:48:52] assembly that's wonderful and thriving
[1:48:54] and not being the person of the Lord
[1:48:56] Jesus Christ
[1:48:58] I'd rather be filled with the Holy
[1:49:00] Spirit knowing that I am in I am in him
[1:49:02] and he is in me that's exactly what
[1:49:05] Jesus prayed he said I pray that you
[1:49:08] would not take them out of the world
[1:49:09] leave them there because in the world is
[1:49:13] the mechanism whereby they can be shaped
[1:49:15] and molded and changed and all these
[1:49:17] different things so leave them there but
[1:49:19] I pray that you keep them from Evil and
[1:49:21] the method whereby you will do that is
[1:49:23] you will make them one as you and I are
[1:49:26] one
[1:49:27] so the unity that that Jesus Christ had
[1:49:30] is the same Unity that you can have with
[1:49:33] him
[1:49:34] and it's not just with an association
[1:49:35] with the church
[1:49:37] or personality right I always tell
[1:49:39] everybody you don't don't be so caught
[1:49:42] up in in brother Steve or his
[1:49:43] personality because I'll disappoint you
[1:49:46] I'm a people so I'm going to disappoint
[1:49:48] you
[1:49:49] so be caught up and Associate yourself
[1:49:51] with the person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:53] and he will in turn place you in that
[1:49:56] assembly and you will Thrive you'll be
[1:49:59] such an on fire member of of the of the
[1:50:01] Assembly of God because when you get the
[1:50:03] the vertical right the horizontal will
[1:50:05] work itself out all of the scripture is
[1:50:07] speaking in the New Testament Paul is
[1:50:10] speaking about Unity with the church
[1:50:12] that you may have Unity with your
[1:50:13] brethren that you may keep the bond of
[1:50:15] of Peace uh which is Charity the bond of
[1:50:19] unity which is Charity which is love so
[1:50:21] the thing that holds the unity together
[1:50:23] is love
[1:50:25] so he said keep that but there's a
[1:50:27] different Greek word that's used there
[1:50:28] as it speaks about the unity between you
[1:50:31] and Christ it's a totally different word
[1:50:33] the word that speaks of unity in the
[1:50:35] scripture and I don't have time to go
[1:50:36] through it
[1:50:37] um is is the word that speaks of unity
[1:50:39] in in reference to your relationship
[1:50:41] with the Lord Jesus Christ is all about
[1:50:44] Fellowship
[1:50:46] and and the relationship between Unity
[1:50:48] with the Brethren is about love and
[1:50:50] patience and kindness
[1:50:52] so it says you're going to have to be
[1:50:54] patient with one another because you're
[1:50:56] all people and people be people
[1:50:58] so when people be people you make sure
[1:51:01] that you're in alignment with the Lord
[1:51:02] Jesus Christ first and foremost
[1:51:05] and then he'll bring unity in The Bride
[1:51:07] of Jesus Christ Brethren among brethren
[1:51:10] when you switch that then you're going
[1:51:12] to get yourself into trouble because
[1:51:13] what I find a lot of times is that
[1:51:15] people will try to create Unity first
[1:51:17] and then bring the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:51:19] into the picture
[1:51:20] so they're trying to you know get Unity
[1:51:22] together and get all these things
[1:51:23] together and and um I'm amazed at how
[1:51:27] God brings the bride together
[1:51:29] um uh brother Ronald just use you and me
[1:51:31] you saw me grow up
[1:51:34] and I'm you know I'm
[1:51:37] um I know a lot a lot of you you've been
[1:51:39] in the message longer than I've been
[1:51:40] alive
[1:51:41] and you know things that I don't know
[1:51:43] you have you have a knowledge set you
[1:51:45] have an experience set that I'll never
[1:51:46] know
[1:51:47] but the Lord is over here working in my
[1:51:48] life
[1:51:49] and the Lord's over here working in your
[1:51:51] life I doubt there's I doubt we would
[1:51:52] agree on 100 everything right we're just
[1:51:56] different we're different guys the Lord
[1:51:57] has called us different things
[1:51:59] um uh we're just different guys so we
[1:52:01] may not agree on 100 everything but in
[1:52:03] in areas of Doctrine and where the Holy
[1:52:06] Spirit wants us aligned he'll bring us
[1:52:08] into an alignment and we can have Unity
[1:52:10] on the basis of the word even though
[1:52:12] even personally we may not may not agree
[1:52:14] that's a beautiful thing
[1:52:17] and we have that yeah and I pray we
[1:52:19] always keep it amen amen and it's the
[1:52:21] power of the holy spirit that will do it
[1:52:23] people and people in the assembly the
[1:52:26] same way the unity is not just in
[1:52:28] agreement
[1:52:29] right the unity is in your alignment to
[1:52:32] the holy spirit that brings your
[1:52:34] understanding of the knowledge of the
[1:52:36] Lord
[1:52:37] so as you grow in Grace and in knowledge
[1:52:39] the scripture says the spirit of wisdom
[1:52:40] and a revelation will work according to
[1:52:42] your knowledge of him you may have
[1:52:45] different knowledge than me at this
[1:52:46] point in time I may have different
[1:52:47] knowledge than you but the spirit of
[1:52:49] wisdom and a revelation that's working
[1:52:51] in and amongst us will bring us right
[1:52:52] into an alignment with the spirit of
[1:52:54] Truth and he is this he is the truth
[1:52:57] Jesus said I am the truth and the life
[1:53:00] and the way so it's not your truth it's
[1:53:02] not my truth he is the truth
[1:53:05] and where there's the truth will set you
[1:53:07] free
[1:53:08] So within that there's freedom to be
[1:53:11] ourselves but we're going to come into
[1:53:13] alignment with the word you can't follow
[1:53:15] one scripture while breaking another
[1:53:16] so you can't say well yes I believe in
[1:53:18] the word and then and then a sister go
[1:53:20] and say well I can trim the ends of my
[1:53:22] hair off
[1:53:23] right that you're you're adding
[1:53:25] something in there it's not according to
[1:53:27] the word so we're not going to have
[1:53:29] unity in that there's going to be all
[1:53:30] kinds of different uh feelings on these
[1:53:33] different things the Holy Spirit wants
[1:53:34] us to bring us into an alignment with
[1:53:36] his word and so unification happens and
[1:53:39] it can happen when you have alignment
[1:53:42] with the Holy Spirit first
[1:53:44] I find that all I've seen it many times
[1:53:46] even myself
[1:53:48] um in our in our town where I live years
[1:53:51] back there are all kinds of um just
[1:53:53] disagreements Between Brothers and all
[1:53:54] these different things and for a long
[1:53:57] time Believers wouldn't even talk to
[1:53:58] each other in the same grocery store
[1:54:01] I know you don't have this problem out
[1:54:02] here but back there we we it was it was
[1:54:07] it was legitimate it it happened and
[1:54:10] years and years and years and years of
[1:54:11] of those disagreements and back and
[1:54:13] forth and back bitings caused that
[1:54:16] separation between Believers now I
[1:54:18] believe
[1:54:19] um God has a way of working everything
[1:54:21] out to his purpose and you never I
[1:54:24] always look at something you think man
[1:54:25] that's a horrible thing and it's um it's
[1:54:29] exactly where God wants it to be and you
[1:54:31] think oh it does not make sense
[1:54:32] oftentimes what the Holy Spirit does not
[1:54:34] make what he does does not make sense
[1:54:37] and so people are in the grocery store
[1:54:40] not even talking to each other and I uh
[1:54:42] there was a when I first became a pastor
[1:54:44] at the church I said Hey Brother
[1:54:46] so-and-so is having meetings um I'm
[1:54:48] gonna be there let's all go
[1:54:50] and they said what
[1:54:52] it was a foreign concept totally blew my
[1:54:55] mind no we can't we can't do that
[1:54:58] we can't do that at all I thought man
[1:55:01] what a shame
[1:55:02] and it's taken years and years and now
[1:55:04] people from that assembly are going uh
[1:55:06] to meetings and things like that and
[1:55:07] it's like you know what
[1:55:09] let's let the Lord have his way where
[1:55:12] that's concerned and I want Unity with
[1:55:14] the Holy Spirit
[1:55:15] and let him create the unity amongst us
[1:55:18] because if I manufacture Unity
[1:55:21] then something's going to come in and
[1:55:23] disrupt it
[1:55:24] if I can convince somebody into
[1:55:26] something someone is going to come right
[1:55:27] along behind me and convince them out of
[1:55:29] it
[1:55:30] so I'd rather be in alignment with the
[1:55:31] Holy Spirit and let him set the
[1:55:33] foundation and let him be the Rock
[1:55:36] and then the unity happen as a result of
[1:55:38] that alignment
[1:55:39] because if someone is shooting off over
[1:55:41] here and I want to be right in alignment
[1:55:43] with the Holy Spirit I want to be aware
[1:55:45] of that because the scripture says know
[1:55:46] those who who labor among you discern
[1:55:49] those things and be aware of those
[1:55:50] things be wise as serpents and harmless
[1:55:52] as doves and so we want that kind of
[1:55:54] unity in the Lord Jesus Christ now
[1:55:56] brother Branham he said many different
[1:55:58] times he said in 58 in the unity of one
[1:56:01] God in one church he says there is what
[1:56:03] God wants you filled with he wants you
[1:56:05] filled with the Holy Ghost and then
[1:56:07] you'll be United
[1:56:09] so brother Brown taught this from 58 all
[1:56:11] the way to 65. he preached it from 47
[1:56:13] all the way to 65. and he says um what
[1:56:17] to a church no sir you'll be United what
[1:56:20] to agreed no sir he says you'll be
[1:56:23] knighted you'll be United to God
[1:56:26] he says in your in you and him will be
[1:56:28] one and he and his father is one
[1:56:31] he says and then God's holy spirit will
[1:56:33] live in you and the same works that the
[1:56:35] Holy Spirit performed when it was here
[1:56:37] in Christ Jesus shall be performed in
[1:56:39] you for he said it he would do it then
[1:56:41] we are one now he said in 1958 in the
[1:56:45] Oneness of unity a different service he
[1:56:47] said God wants people to be one
[1:56:50] and it is strange to think but the devil
[1:56:53] tries to put his plan into existence and
[1:56:55] make all the people one under his plan
[1:56:57] so God wants unification Satan wants
[1:57:00] unification as well so Satan wants to
[1:57:02] disrupt the unity that you have with the
[1:57:04] Holy Spirit he wants to mess with that
[1:57:08] but he also wants you to come under
[1:57:09] Unity to to what he's doing now in the
[1:57:11] same service a little bit later brother
[1:57:12] Venom he says and if you will get behind
[1:57:14] it is the same motive that was at the
[1:57:17] Tower of Babel to build a man-made
[1:57:19] Earthly Dominion
[1:57:21] he said if you get behind Satan's desire
[1:57:23] for unification he says it's the exact
[1:57:25] same spirit that led everybody with the
[1:57:28] same language the same unification to
[1:57:30] get behind that
[1:57:32] he says instead he don't want you all
[1:57:34] United under Rome he don't want you
[1:57:36] United under any church Dominion he
[1:57:39] wants a United under his spiritual
[1:57:40] Kingdom
[1:57:41] the Holy Spirit
[1:57:44] that's where we find Unity
[1:57:47] now I find many times I want to just
[1:57:51] switch over here just for a second to
[1:57:52] the Book of Exodus and I'll just
[1:57:54] paraphrase for the sake of time
[1:57:56] the Israelites are there they come out
[1:57:58] they're wandering around and they come
[1:58:01] to Mount Sinai and I've always I've
[1:58:04] always wanted to go I want to go and
[1:58:05] climb Mount Sinai
[1:58:08] um maybe you'll come with me
[1:58:11] I've always wanted to go up to the top
[1:58:12] of that mountain here's
[1:58:14] um Moses and here's the raw power of God
[1:58:17] come down on top of that mountain the
[1:58:20] lightning the Thunder the light it's
[1:58:22] just the wind and that's that's God down
[1:58:24] there on top of that mountain and Moses
[1:58:26] goes right up into it
[1:58:28] he walks right up into it he's
[1:58:30] considered a friend of God he walks
[1:58:31] right into the raw power of God not an
[1:58:34] amazing concept
[1:58:36] here's the people of Israel and they're
[1:58:37] down there and they're they're they
[1:58:39] experience it it's so powerful that they
[1:58:41] can't even look at the mountain
[1:58:43] so here they're praying not just
[1:58:45] chapters before they're saying Lord we
[1:58:47] want you to come we want you to help us
[1:58:48] we need water we need all these
[1:58:50] different things and they're saying I
[1:58:51] want you to help me I want you to to
[1:58:53] bring us to the promised land and now
[1:58:55] here God comes down
[1:58:57] God himself
[1:58:59] and then Moses comes back down and they
[1:59:01] say Moses we we can do this you speak
[1:59:04] for us don't let God speak directly to
[1:59:06] us we want you to speak for through uh
[1:59:09] through him uh or him to speak through
[1:59:11] you because we literally can't take the
[1:59:13] presence of God so chapters before
[1:59:15] they're saying God we need you and we
[1:59:17] want you and then a few chapters later
[1:59:19] God comes down and they're saying oh but
[1:59:21] we don't want him that close
[1:59:24] so they they literally draw back and
[1:59:26] they say no no no we didn't want this
[1:59:27] this is not what we signed up for
[1:59:29] we didn't want this it's you're way too
[1:59:32] close back up a little bit Moses you
[1:59:34] speak for us and so God says okay
[1:59:38] he says okay I find that a lot of times
[1:59:40] many Believers will say Lord I want you
[1:59:43] I want Unity I want I want you to I want
[1:59:46] to be United with your spirit and then
[1:59:48] he'll come down and speak to you and you
[1:59:50] back up and you say oh I want him that
[1:59:51] close I don't want him dealing right
[1:59:53] there he comes down and he starts
[1:59:55] messing with your marriage to try to
[1:59:57] make it better and sometimes it needs to
[1:59:59] get things need to get hard before it
[2:00:01] gets better sometimes we need to let
[2:00:03] down our stubborn Natures because people
[2:00:06] do be people
[2:00:08] and just let some instruction in
[2:00:12] and let it burn a little bit
[2:00:14] let your pride down and just just be
[2:00:17] wrong once in a while and God might be
[2:00:20] able to work in your marriage
[2:00:24] think critically about that it matters
[2:00:26] it matters to your children so stop
[2:00:29] fooling around and let the Lord deal
[2:00:31] with it and it's going to hurt it may
[2:00:33] hurt it may really cause some pain
[2:00:37] but oftentimes people say I don't want
[2:00:38] them that close and so the holy spirit's
[2:00:40] moving and he's he's in the place we say
[2:00:42] Lord I want you to move but you don't
[2:00:44] want him to move in that area
[2:00:47] and you never know the Lord may want to
[2:00:48] deal with this area over here before he
[2:00:50] deals with this area over here before He
[2:00:52] blesses you over here he might want you
[2:00:54] want you to deal over here you can be so
[2:00:55] successful in your career and be
[2:00:57] spiritually stagnant and be blessed and
[2:01:00] have all the money in the world doesn't
[2:01:01] mean anything
[2:01:03] money money God's got plenty of money
[2:01:05] money doesn't matter
[2:01:07] obviously we need to pay bills it
[2:01:09] matters
[2:01:11] God will give you exactly what you have
[2:01:12] need of
[2:01:14] sometimes you need to let God deal in
[2:01:16] the areas and just because you're being
[2:01:18] blessed and you've got a great job and
[2:01:19] all these different things does not mean
[2:01:21] that you are spiritually where you need
[2:01:22] to be so you need to think critically
[2:01:24] about where you are at and let the Lord
[2:01:26] deal with you because the children of
[2:01:27] Israel asked for him to come and speak
[2:01:29] to them and move them and bring them
[2:01:31] into unification to lead them into the
[2:01:33] promised land he comes down and they say
[2:01:35] oh and I didn't want that
[2:01:38] if you want to break through with the
[2:01:39] Lord you've got to be Willy willing to
[2:01:42] get close to him and let him get close
[2:01:45] to you
[2:01:46] because you might not like what happens
[2:01:48] when he gets close to you
[2:01:50] you might push back on a little bit
[2:01:53] because you you can be messed up you can
[2:01:55] have situations in your life that need
[2:01:58] serious dealing with
[2:02:00] especially young people you can you can
[2:02:01] be in a place in your life where you're
[2:02:03] we're talking about it Friday night
[2:02:05] where you can be apathetic you can say
[2:02:07] and you need to own that and be real
[2:02:09] with yourself and say brother Steve I am
[2:02:12] just not into the service
[2:02:14] I don't know what's wrong with me I'm
[2:02:16] just not into it I'm apathetic to
[2:02:18] whatever is happening around here so if
[2:02:20] you're raising your hand and you're
[2:02:21] saying yes Lord you know I want you and
[2:02:23] you're getting into the music and all
[2:02:24] these different things you can be
[2:02:26] sitting there and thinking I am feeling
[2:02:27] nothing I don't even know what's going
[2:02:30] on around here you need to own that
[2:02:32] because the Lord knows about it and you
[2:02:34] need to deal with it you need you can
[2:02:36] seek after the Lord because the Lord is
[2:02:38] very clear he said if you draw near to
[2:02:40] him
[2:02:41] he will in turn draw near unto you but
[2:02:44] when he does draw near to you you need
[2:02:47] to let him get close
[2:02:49] don't be afraid of that and don't push
[2:02:51] back on that because that's how he is
[2:02:54] going to bring you into Unity with him
[2:02:56] so his process of bringing you into
[2:02:58] Unity is Jesus Christ sitting there Lord
[2:03:00] may they be one as you and I are one
[2:03:04] and there's nothing in between Jesus
[2:03:06] submitted himself to the word that was
[2:03:09] within him
[2:03:10] he had the power to raise up and to lay
[2:03:13] down and yet he willingly went to the
[2:03:15] cross and he laid himself down by the
[2:03:18] word that was in him he let the word
[2:03:20] work in his life he wasn't afraid of it
[2:03:23] he submitted himself to the Lord because
[2:03:25] he and the Lord were one and he wasn't
[2:03:28] afraid for the Lord to get close and to
[2:03:30] do the work that the Lord needed to do
[2:03:33] so he yielded his vessel to the Lord and
[2:03:35] said have your way not let this let this
[2:03:38] cup pass from me if it will but your
[2:03:41] will be done not mine he would teach his
[2:03:44] disciples pray this not mine will but
[2:03:46] thine be done on Earth as it is in
[2:03:49] heaven
[2:03:50] and so we can pray yes I want the Lord's
[2:03:52] will on Earth as it is in heaven and
[2:03:54] then the Lord gets close and said you
[2:03:56] need to change this and we'll say oh no
[2:03:58] no I don't want him to be that close or
[2:04:00] I'll deal with that I'll deal with that
[2:04:02] in my own time
[2:04:04] you realize that demons and spirits
[2:04:06] they're real they don't they don't want
[2:04:08] to leave
[2:04:09] they do they they mess around because
[2:04:12] they don't have anything better to do
[2:04:15] and so they mess with that which has
[2:04:16] life so they're going to try to mess
[2:04:19] with you and your children
[2:04:20] in your family
[2:04:22] and Satan and his army is going to try
[2:04:24] to come at you with everything that he's
[2:04:26] got and try to mess with your mind and
[2:04:28] mess with your brain
[2:04:30] it's what he does
[2:04:32] but greater is he that's in you that's
[2:04:35] he that than he that's within the world
[2:04:37] so you have all of the promises of God
[2:04:40] behind you
[2:04:41] through the power of the Holy Spirit and
[2:04:44] when you live in the power of his
[2:04:45] resurrection you can by his grace bring
[2:04:48] unto subjection that which sets itself
[2:04:51] against the knowledge of God but when
[2:04:54] the Holy Spirit comes and tries to
[2:04:56] consume you and take you and and and do
[2:04:59] something in your life you have to let
[2:05:01] him
[2:05:02] you have to you have to let down the
[2:05:04] bars and say Lord I want you I I invited
[2:05:06] you I asked for it let me have the
[2:05:09] courage to receive it
[2:05:11] you know there's a lot of things in my
[2:05:13] life that I've dealt with and I've
[2:05:15] realized I am the one that's holding
[2:05:17] myself back brother Branham said the
[2:05:19] same thing he said if I can get the guy
[2:05:21] in the mirror if I can get that guy and
[2:05:24] bring him into subjection to the word
[2:05:26] then something will happen in that guy's
[2:05:28] life
[2:05:29] and so some of the greatest things that
[2:05:31] I've gone through is when I've come to
[2:05:33] the realization that Grace and humility
[2:05:35] coincide and at those points in my life
[2:05:38] God has done something great because I
[2:05:41] was I I don't want God to Humble me I'd
[2:05:43] rather humble myself and you you when
[2:05:45] Grace and humility coincide that's where
[2:05:48] God will deal with you that's when God
[2:05:49] dealt with a prodigal son the prodigal
[2:05:51] son was at a place of humility and he
[2:05:53] had never been in his life and at that
[2:05:55] point Grace coincided and his father was
[2:05:58] running out to him and said I want you I
[2:06:00] want you back and his son was saying I'm
[2:06:03] not even worthy and his son was walking
[2:06:05] right up to his father's house boldly
[2:06:07] before the throne of grace at a place of
[2:06:10] humility where he realized Lord I I
[2:06:12] don't want to hold back anymore I don't
[2:06:14] want to sit in the Hog Pen anymore I
[2:06:16] want to let you in
[2:06:19] in order to have unity in order to have
[2:06:21] the unity that you that you really want
[2:06:24] you've got to be willing to let God
[2:06:26] close you've got to be willing to let
[2:06:29] him come and sometimes it will it will
[2:06:31] burn a little bit
[2:06:33] especially young people this will happen
[2:06:35] multiple times in your spiritual lives
[2:06:37] the new birth produces the Life of
[2:06:40] Christ in you it is the screaming
[2:06:42] kicking baby that the birth produces
[2:06:44] that baby grows it changes it evolves
[2:06:48] that life that's now produced is the
[2:06:50] Life of Christ that it learns it it
[2:06:53] becomes intelligent a baby doesn't just
[2:06:55] stay a baby it grows it it goes through
[2:06:57] hard knocks it goes through all these
[2:06:58] different things it becomes intelligent
[2:07:00] it becomes uh it learns things and
[2:07:02] adapts to its environment it grows
[2:07:04] that's exactly what God is doing in your
[2:07:06] spiritual life he's changing you he's
[2:07:08] growing you he's adapting you he's he's
[2:07:11] bringing his word to pass in your life
[2:07:13] and One Sweet Day there's a promise
[2:07:16] that's overriding the Bride of Jesus
[2:07:18] Christ and we'll be gone in the moment
[2:07:20] of a twinkling of an eye that promise is
[2:07:22] already inside of you and it's the word
[2:07:24] it's the holy spirit in your life that
[2:07:26] will bring that promise to pass it's not
[2:07:28] it's not you making that happen the Holy
[2:07:31] Spirit and the promise that God said and
[2:07:33] set in order before the foundation of
[2:07:34] the world is going to come to pass
[2:07:36] because of the word that's inside of you
[2:07:38] you have to yield yourself to that
[2:07:40] process yield yourself to the word
[2:07:43] that's inside of you
[2:07:44] because the greatest of mysteries that
[2:07:46] would be given to the Gentiles is simply
[2:07:48] put Christ in you the hope of glory
[2:07:53] now brother Branham said in 1959 and he
[2:07:56] said a reaction to an action I love that
[2:07:58] title he says now he's talking about the
[2:08:00] the meetings that he was having he says
[2:08:02] and I think it would be good for prayer
[2:08:04] meetings to be going on all day long
[2:08:05] around here just everywhere for you
[2:08:07] cannot get anything from God until you
[2:08:10] get close to God
[2:08:12] so brother Branham says this he says now
[2:08:14] you've got to get close to the Lord
[2:08:16] many times we have trouble with that
[2:08:20] maybe because you don't know him
[2:08:22] as you could
[2:08:24] now I find that a lot of times if I have
[2:08:26] a relationship
[2:08:27] um with one of you Brothers brother
[2:08:28] Enoch and I we have a great uh I think
[2:08:31] we have a great friendship we don't hang
[2:08:32] out as much as we should we need to
[2:08:34] change that but uh we know each other
[2:08:36] we're good friends now we we can come
[2:08:38] into a relationship and a relationship
[2:08:40] is a little bit different than
[2:08:40] Fellowship because
[2:08:42] um I can come in I can know brother
[2:08:43] Enoch's name and I can say hey what's
[2:08:45] your name you know what do you do what
[2:08:45] are your hobbies you know all that kind
[2:08:47] of stuff and we can know each other on a
[2:08:49] superficial level and have that
[2:08:51] relationship so if I um if somebody says
[2:08:52] do you know brother Enoch I said yeah I
[2:08:54] have met him I know him and I I know of
[2:08:56] him and and things like that and they
[2:08:57] say what is his greatest heart's desire
[2:08:59] and I said well I don't know that
[2:09:02] I mean I we haven't you know spent weeks
[2:09:04] together out in the mountains maybe we
[2:09:07] should
[2:09:07] uh that would actually be really cool
[2:09:09] but you know we I haven't spent that
[2:09:12] much time with you to know your heart's
[2:09:14] desire right what does brother Enoch
[2:09:16] want what does he want to do with his
[2:09:17] life where does he want to go I don't
[2:09:19] know that because I haven't spent that
[2:09:20] time in fellowship with him because when
[2:09:23] you're in a relationship you know each
[2:09:24] other you know of each other you know
[2:09:25] about things you can you know we can
[2:09:27] talk we can hang out but if we come into
[2:09:29] Fellowship together we're coming on a
[2:09:30] whole new level we're actually
[2:09:32] developing a Unity together because
[2:09:34] we're understanding what drives you and
[2:09:37] what drives me what problems are you
[2:09:39] facing he can be vulnerable in a
[2:09:41] fellowship with me if he if he learns to
[2:09:43] trust me and if I learn to trust him I
[2:09:46] can share things with him I have I have
[2:09:48] a you have a fellowship with your spouse
[2:09:49] I have a fellowship with Sister Sarah I
[2:09:51] don't have with anybody else because she
[2:09:54] knows me
[2:09:55] she knows what I'm like when I get off
[2:09:57] of the pulpit
[2:09:58] she knows what I'm like at home she
[2:10:00] knows how I treat her at home nobody
[2:10:02] else knows that we're in Fellowship
[2:10:04] so she can help me in ways that none of
[2:10:07] you can help me
[2:10:08] she sees things and can talk to me in a
[2:10:10] way that none of you can do because
[2:10:12] we're in a completely whole new
[2:10:13] different area of relationship we've
[2:10:15] come into fellowship with one another we
[2:10:17] know one each other we we we get on
[2:10:20] that's what you that's what God wants
[2:10:22] with you is a fellowship
[2:10:25] you young people you have to believe
[2:10:27] that you don't have that right now no
[2:10:29] problem he'll give it to you he'll bring
[2:10:31] you into fellowship with him and don't
[2:10:33] you for a second think that he doesn't
[2:10:35] want that with you he does want that
[2:10:37] with you that's why he died on the cross
[2:10:39] and rose again and sent back the holy
[2:10:42] spirit so that he could be alive in you
[2:10:44] to show you how much he cares about you
[2:10:47] to show you the Redemption story in the
[2:10:50] last day today which is why it's such a
[2:10:52] special moment that before the
[2:10:54] foundation of the world I had set my
[2:10:56] voice to speak to you in this day to
[2:10:58] tell you who you are
[2:11:00] and that's just to the oldest just as
[2:11:02] much to the new because I think you can
[2:11:04] be old and still struggle with
[2:11:06] fellowship with the Lord you can be old
[2:11:08] and have gone to a message church for 50
[2:11:11] years longer than I've been alive
[2:11:12] doesn't matter
[2:11:14] you can know him in a fellowship
[2:11:16] but a lot of times it's harder because
[2:11:19] you've developed patterns and things
[2:11:21] like that in areas of comfort that you
[2:11:24] don't want the Lord to come across
[2:11:25] maybe you've got areas of stubbornness
[2:11:27] that you don't want the Lord to come
[2:11:28] across he can deal with that don't you
[2:11:31] tell me for a second that the Lord can't
[2:11:32] teach an old dog a new trick because it
[2:11:35] says behold all things in Christ are new
[2:11:37] all things are passed away
[2:11:39] so don't tell me that he can't still
[2:11:41] deal in your life if you're in 80 90. he
[2:11:44] can deal in your life and he can bring
[2:11:46] you into a fellowship that you never
[2:11:47] thought was possible regardless of how
[2:11:49] long you've lived
[2:11:51] so it's not just to the young it's to
[2:11:52] the old just the same God doesn't want
[2:11:54] you just in mere association with an
[2:11:56] assembly he wants you to be in
[2:11:58] fellowship with him he desires that more
[2:12:00] than anything else Jesus himself prayed
[2:12:03] it Lord I pray that you make them and
[2:12:06] he's praying for you
[2:12:07] that should make them one as you and I
[2:12:10] are one so why would we fight against
[2:12:12] that why would we fool around with that
[2:12:14] and dance around it I say we step into
[2:12:16] it and say Lord I want that fellowship
[2:12:19] with you teach me how to do it
[2:12:22] give me a life give me a show me the
[2:12:24] process how can you make me to know you
[2:12:27] in the power of your Resurrection that's
[2:12:29] what I want
[2:12:32] I don't want to fool around just with
[2:12:34] the doctrine of the message of the hour
[2:12:35] I want to be the message of the hour
[2:12:38] that's what I want in my life
[2:12:40] if I really am the only Grace that the
[2:12:43] world around me will experience then I
[2:12:45] pray that I would be able to give a hope
[2:12:47] to the calling that was made sure in me
[2:12:50] so I need to make my calling an election
[2:12:52] sure I need to know and in order to do
[2:12:54] that you have to let the Lord get close
[2:12:56] to you when you invite him if you
[2:12:59] profess Lord I want to know you in the
[2:13:01] power of your Resurrection then you need
[2:13:03] to be willing to let him close to you
[2:13:05] and deal with you
[2:13:07] and change you and mold you and shape
[2:13:09] you because he promised he would don't
[2:13:12] think for a second and he won't do it in
[2:13:14] your life
[2:13:16] whatever it is you Lay It Before the
[2:13:18] Throne boldly and say Lord I want you to
[2:13:20] deal with this and I will have the
[2:13:22] courage to respond in whatever that
[2:13:24] looks like
[2:13:26] yes you might not like what it looks
[2:13:28] like we were talking on Friday The
[2:13:29] Greatest Adventure that you will ever
[2:13:31] have is following the leading of the
[2:13:33] Holy Spirit he will lead you to do
[2:13:34] things lead you to say say things that
[2:13:36] you never thought you'd be doing
[2:13:38] my father is a is a pastor
[2:13:42] um my grandfather was a pastor so
[2:13:44] everybody looked at me and they said
[2:13:45] you're going to be a preacher and I
[2:13:46] genuinely in my heart I said not on your
[2:13:49] life
[2:13:50] I said I I will not do that because I
[2:13:53] know the hardship that a pastor goes
[2:13:55] through
[2:13:55] I know what I know the toll that it has
[2:13:58] on him and his family
[2:14:01] and I know that that's difficult and I
[2:14:03] know that that that's a pressure that I
[2:14:05] didn't wish from my wife I didn't wish
[2:14:07] for any of my family and the Lord had
[2:14:09] other
[2:14:10] other things in mind
[2:14:12] it's been an adventure and it's an
[2:14:14] adventure that I want to I want to press
[2:14:15] into
[2:14:17] I want I want to have that adventure of
[2:14:19] the holy spirit because life is just a
[2:14:21] breath it's just a moment so whatever
[2:14:23] you're dealing with whatever depression
[2:14:24] you have or anxiety you feel like you're
[2:14:26] worthless you've got an adventure
[2:14:27] waiting for you
[2:14:29] that may seem cheesy
[2:14:32] true
[2:14:34] it's into that
[2:14:35] press into that Adventure that he he
[2:14:37] wants you to have but you've got to be
[2:14:40] willing to let him close if that means
[2:14:42] you need to run to an altar and say Lord
[2:14:43] I I want that from you then run don't
[2:14:46] stop run
[2:14:48] if that means that you just need to
[2:14:49] raise your hand and say Lord I I I'm
[2:14:51] just I'm dealing with apathy I want you
[2:14:53] to I want you to feel me I need you I
[2:14:55] need you yeah maybe you have kids and
[2:14:57] you're thinking oh Lord I need to I need
[2:14:59] to get myself right so that my kids will
[2:15:01] know the power of the Resurrection
[2:15:03] because I you need to be real with
[2:15:04] yourself enough to say that my kids are
[2:15:06] they're probably not seeing in me what
[2:15:08] they need to see
[2:15:09] so you can deal with the Lord can deal
[2:15:12] with you on that and you can be in unity
[2:15:15] with him in a whole new level of
[2:15:17] Fellowship that you never thought
[2:15:18] possible and in turn he'll deal with
[2:15:20] your kids lives
[2:15:22] he'll answer your prayer
[2:15:23] but you need to get yourself in order so
[2:15:25] that he can work in other areas of your
[2:15:27] life it's an amazing thing brother
[2:15:29] Branham says in order to get to get
[2:15:31] anything from God you got to get close
[2:15:33] to him
[2:15:34] what kind of people are we professing to
[2:15:36] be if we're not letting the holy spirit
[2:15:38] all the way in
[2:15:41] brother Banner said we should be the
[2:15:42] happiest people on the face of the
[2:15:44] planet but I wonder how many miserable
[2:15:46] Believers there are
[2:15:48] absolutely miserable Believers people
[2:15:50] who believe the message of the hour and
[2:15:52] they're just always down and always out
[2:15:54] and all these different things do you do
[2:15:55] you know what you believe do you know
[2:15:58] what we have in our hands do you know
[2:16:00] what the Lord Has Done in this day and
[2:16:03] when you really grab a hold of that it's
[2:16:04] a personalization remember the Lord is
[2:16:06] speaking to you you are the bride you
[2:16:09] are the one you are the Redemption story
[2:16:11] this is not you out here and and the
[2:16:14] bride over here that you are the bride
[2:16:16] he wants you so you have to personalize
[2:16:19] that and you have to say Lord you're
[2:16:20] speaking directly to me you have spoken
[2:16:22] to me in this day and I'm listening to
[2:16:25] the voice you have to let them get close
[2:16:27] 1963 God deals with an individual not
[2:16:30] with groups now brother Brandon was
[2:16:32] dealing with denominationalism but that
[2:16:34] denominationalistic Spirit can get into
[2:16:37] the ranks of the message and cause that
[2:16:40] associative attitude while I'm
[2:16:42] associated with The Message Church young
[2:16:44] people especially maybe because you
[2:16:46] haven't met the Lord in the in the way
[2:16:48] that you can I don't know whatever it is
[2:16:50] but you can have that associative
[2:16:51] attitude of well if I go to the camps if
[2:16:54] I do this if I go to the altar when they
[2:16:55] have the altar call if I if I really
[2:16:57] believe you know and do this thing then
[2:16:59] I'll get this so it's a fast food window
[2:17:01] mentality especially in in that
[2:17:04] Millennial uh gen Z generation because I
[2:17:07] go I put them in my order I go up to the
[2:17:09] window I get my food out and then I go
[2:17:10] on
[2:17:12] that's good
[2:17:13] um I deal with road rage
[2:17:15] and I'm just being honest I'm being
[2:17:18] vulnerable I deal with road rage and
[2:17:20] when you go road rage translates really
[2:17:22] well to a fast food window so if you go
[2:17:24] to a fast food when you order your food
[2:17:25] and then you have to wait or something
[2:17:28] and and just it just I I the Lord tests
[2:17:31] me in those lines
[2:17:33] and that's the kind of society that we
[2:17:36] have so naturally it's going to affect
[2:17:38] your thinking
[2:17:40] so you may be have an associative kind
[2:17:42] of attitude with the message of the hour
[2:17:43] and you don't even realize it filled
[2:17:45] with the Holy Ghost and you've got this
[2:17:47] attitude of if I go to church I put in
[2:17:49] my coin I get the thing out and then I
[2:17:51] go
[2:17:52] and that's that's a shameful way to live
[2:17:54] and everybody may live like that but I
[2:17:56] don't want to live like that you don't
[2:17:58] have to live like that because the Lord
[2:18:00] is not a coin machine or an Aaron boy
[2:18:01] that you put your coin and you get your
[2:18:03] feeling out right or you get your oh I
[2:18:05] feel great because I was at the altar
[2:18:06] and then you go home and you're
[2:18:07] struggling with the exact same things
[2:18:09] that you've been dealing with for 5 10
[2:18:11] 15 years
[2:18:12] not happening in my life I don't want to
[2:18:15] live like that I don't know about you
[2:18:17] but I serve a powerful God and he has
[2:18:19] enabled us to overcome in this day and
[2:18:22] if he's promised me that then I want
[2:18:23] that Adventure
[2:18:25] so I'm not going to play patty cake with
[2:18:27] the devil I want to get serious and I
[2:18:29] want to let the Lord close
[2:18:34] what a challenge
[2:18:36] God wants fathers he wants mothers he
[2:18:40] wants young people he wants grandparents
[2:18:43] he wants you to be in unity with him
[2:18:47] he wants you to know him in the power of
[2:18:50] his resurrection
[2:18:52] and I know
[2:18:54] that there are people in this room who
[2:18:55] don't have that as much as they would
[2:18:57] want to have it
[2:18:59] you can have it listen to my voice you
[2:19:03] can have that relationship with the Lord
[2:19:04] that you want you can come into a
[2:19:06] fellowship with him that you never
[2:19:08] thought was possible you're looking at
[2:19:10] the sum total of your complexes you're
[2:19:12] looking at the sum total of your parents
[2:19:13] complexes you don't have to live like
[2:19:15] that
[2:19:16] you get to determine your relationship
[2:19:18] with the Lord and you get to determine
[2:19:20] to come into fellowship with him because
[2:19:22] it's on the basis of free moral agency
[2:19:24] God God has predetermined that you would
[2:19:27] come up to the knowledge of the truth
[2:19:28] God has predetermined and predestinated
[2:19:30] you to stand on Jordan's cold Banks but
[2:19:34] he says whosoever will you can come
[2:19:35] across it
[2:19:37] that's that's how it's a free moral
[2:19:39] agency and it just kind of it dealt with
[2:19:41] me one time it got predestinated that
[2:19:43] you would come to that point but he
[2:19:46] doesn't Force anyone into the holiest of
[2:19:48] holies he never forced anybody across
[2:19:50] Jordan's River
[2:19:52] he said here's Jordan's River
[2:19:54] you can come across
[2:19:56] basis of the holy spirit is on the basis
[2:19:58] of free moral agency he leads you to the
[2:20:01] truth
[2:20:02] but you have the choice of walking
[2:20:03] across maybe you've been filled with the
[2:20:05] Holy Ghost for years and years and years
[2:20:07] and you know that but you're dealing
[2:20:09] with something or perhaps you've fallen
[2:20:10] out of a relationship with him and you
[2:20:12] want to restore that
[2:20:14] you can have that today
[2:20:17] you can have that
[2:20:19] you have to be willing to let the Lord
[2:20:21] close the reason I'm not exactly
[2:20:23] defining that is because it may happen
[2:20:25] differently for each one of you
[2:20:27] it may be here this morning it may be as
[2:20:30] you're driving home it may be on your
[2:20:32] way to work tomorrow as you're driving
[2:20:33] you're just thinking about different
[2:20:35] things that the Lord wants to get close
[2:20:36] to you it may be a week from now that
[2:20:38] you're dealing with something and the
[2:20:39] Lord wants to press into you a little
[2:20:40] bit and and touch you and and and shape
[2:20:43] you you have to be willing to let him
[2:20:45] close this right now is not your only
[2:20:47] moment because he's he's gonna If he if
[2:20:50] the Lord tarries and he gives you
[2:20:51] tomorrow
[2:20:52] he is the same yesterday today as he is
[2:20:55] tomorrow but don't wait till tomorrow
[2:20:58] let him get close to you and what that
[2:21:00] is is it may look differently for each
[2:21:02] one of you the way that the Lord deals
[2:21:04] with me and presses into me and gets
[2:21:05] close to me it may be different than you
[2:21:08] I'm not a very emotional person I don't
[2:21:10] get emotional
[2:21:11] some people are really emotional
[2:21:13] and that's how they respond that's how
[2:21:15] the Lord gets that's how they deal with
[2:21:16] them that's how they that's how they act
[2:21:18] and that's you have to respond to the
[2:21:21] Lord in the way that he's pressing into
[2:21:22] you don't worry about who's around you
[2:21:24] that doesn't matter a lick
[2:21:26] they may be dealing with something worse
[2:21:28] than you and you responding to the Holy
[2:21:30] Spirit could change them in a way that
[2:21:32] you never thought possible so don't hold
[2:21:34] yourself back from letting yourself into
[2:21:36] the presence of God let yourself go let
[2:21:39] go and let God have his way
[2:21:42] you know many times we pray for Unity
[2:21:44] and we pray for it and we want it we ask
[2:21:46] it and then when it comes we say oh no
[2:21:49] no that's I didn't think it would look
[2:21:50] like that I don't want it
[2:21:52] and sometimes that can be with us that
[2:21:54] can be with the Lord
[2:21:56] the Lord wants to be one because Jesus
[2:21:58] that's what he prayed his prayer over
[2:22:00] you and Isaiah 55 is very clear the word
[2:22:04] once given shall not return void so the
[2:22:07] word will have its way I say why stand
[2:22:10] in the way
[2:22:11] let the let the word have its way in our
[2:22:13] lives
[2:22:14] if we are the message if we are message
[2:22:16] believers
[2:22:18] then let's let's let the Lord have his
[2:22:20] way
[2:22:21] if we really can be some of the happiest
[2:22:22] people on the Earth I want to be happy I
[2:22:24] don't know about you
[2:22:25] so let's be happy
[2:22:27] brother Venom he said in the statement
[2:22:28] one time he said down with Satan and his
[2:22:31] Gloom and up with the Lord Jesus in
[2:22:33] faith
[2:22:34] that's the way I look at it I say down
[2:22:36] with Satan and his gloom and up with
[2:22:38] faith in the Lord Jesus Christ you don't
[2:22:41] have to be depressed that's not just a
[2:22:43] cliche or a statement greater is he
[2:22:45] that's within you than he that is within
[2:22:47] the world
[2:22:48] you don't have to deal with anxiety
[2:22:50] anxiety is nothing fear is nothing it's
[2:22:53] a fabulous element but there is
[2:22:55] substance to our faith
[2:22:57] it is the reality of the things that are
[2:23:00] unseen so they're a substance to your
[2:23:02] faith so down with Satan and his Gloom
[2:23:04] and up with the faith in the Lord Jesus
[2:23:07] Christ
[2:23:08] you don't have to be someone that feels
[2:23:10] like they sit on the outside and look in
[2:23:12] God has come to you the voice of God is
[2:23:15] speaking to you in this day you can let
[2:23:18] God close but when he gets close don't
[2:23:20] say no no I didn't want that let him in
[2:23:24] let him deal with you whatever it looks
[2:23:27] like let him deal with you
[2:23:30] bow your heads with me
[2:23:32] musicians won't you come
[2:23:34] I want to pray with you and then the
[2:23:36] musicians come here brother Robert Come
[2:23:39] and sing
[2:23:42] just with your heads bowed
[2:23:48] I I there's probably not one of us in
[2:23:50] this room that feels like they're
[2:23:52] they're finished they're done
[2:23:54] being worked on
[2:23:57] all of us we have we have we know that
[2:24:00] there's things that need to be worked on
[2:24:02] so thank the Lord that he doesn't change
[2:24:04] but praise be to God that we can
[2:24:08] so let's just pray and let's let the
[2:24:10] Lord have his way
[2:24:12] and you can make this moment personal
[2:24:13] I'm not you don't I'm not asking to
[2:24:16] respond in any specific way because this
[2:24:19] is the holy spirit dealing with you so
[2:24:21] you respond to the Holy Spirit and how
[2:24:24] he's leading you you talk to him
[2:24:26] interact with him he's here he's a real
[2:24:28] person you can know him in the power of
[2:24:31] his resurrection you can be refilled you
[2:24:33] can be you can have the joy of your
[2:24:35] salvation restored whatever it is
[2:24:37] whatever need maybe there's no specific
[2:24:39] need and you just want to be in that
[2:24:40] presence then just let the Lord speak to
[2:24:42] you cultivate that that reality that the
[2:24:46] Lord deals in the lives and hearts of
[2:24:48] his of his people Heavenly Father
[2:24:51] Lord I've got my I've got my hands
[2:24:54] raised
[2:24:56] I want more of you I want less of me and
[2:24:59] more of you
[2:25:01] and what I've I've in my life I've
[2:25:04] prayed for years but I want you to be
[2:25:07] close I want you I want to I want more
[2:25:09] of you
[2:25:10] and I don't I want to come into Unity
[2:25:11] with you I want to know you more
[2:25:16] the Lord cultivate in me the willingness
[2:25:19] to let you close
[2:25:21] sometimes I don't like it and I'm
[2:25:24] willing to to say that to admit that
[2:25:26] sometimes I don't like it it's
[2:25:28] uncomfortable
[2:25:30] being wrong receiving criticism changing
[2:25:33] I don't like it
[2:25:36] but it's necessary so Lord if you need
[2:25:38] to do that in me if you need to have my
[2:25:40] wife speaking to me and me listening if
[2:25:42] you need to have uh which I know you do
[2:25:44] if you if you want to speak to me in
[2:25:46] whatever way you would choose may I
[2:25:49] listen and have the courage to follow
[2:25:51] through on what you said
[2:25:54] I don't want to stagnate Lord I want to
[2:25:57] grow in Grace and in knowledge
[2:26:02] Lord I want to be delivered of the
[2:26:04] things Lord there's so many things that
[2:26:05] we deal with lust even depression
[2:26:07] anxiety
[2:26:09] maybe there's healing that we need Lord
[2:26:12] you promised healing you promised
[2:26:14] healing
[2:26:16] you said you lay hands on the sick and
[2:26:18] they shall recover
[2:26:19] you said you are the Lord that heals all
[2:26:21] of our diseases
[2:26:24] so what may we claim that
[2:26:28] Lord you you said that you'd help us
[2:26:30] through in in in the difficulties you
[2:26:33] would be a present help in the time of
[2:26:36] trouble
[2:26:38] so Lord I I pray that you teach me to
[2:26:41] know what does that look like what does
[2:26:43] that mean
[2:26:44] teach me to wait Lord
[2:26:48] teach me to know your sheep hear your
[2:26:50] voice and another they will not follow
[2:26:52] so Lord I want to be in tuned to your
[2:26:55] voice
[2:26:56] I want to know you and the power of your
[2:26:59] resurrection and have a fellowship with
[2:27:00] you that will hold me that's an anchor
[2:27:04] that will not allow me to be tossed to
[2:27:06] and fro by everything that the world
[2:27:08] would throw at me I want to be anchored
[2:27:11] I want to be solid I want to have that
[2:27:13] life I don't want to just talk about it
[2:27:15] I don't want to just believe it Lord I
[2:27:17] want you to make that a reality in my
[2:27:19] life
[2:27:21] so let me let you be close
[2:27:24] let me get out of the way
[2:27:27] let me let you close
[2:27:29] [Music]
[2:27:31] Lord may your presence have its way in
[2:27:33] our hearts
[2:27:34] may you speak to those who need you Lord
[2:27:36] maybe there's those who need the baptism
[2:27:39] of the Holy Spirit
[2:27:40] Lord You're the same yesterday today and
[2:27:42] forever you can fill anyone with the
[2:27:45] Holy Spirit Lord if they have they are
[2:27:46] the desire for it so Lord may it may if
[2:27:49] there's someone here seeking that may
[2:27:50] they press into it
[2:27:52] Lord maybe they don't know you at all
[2:27:54] Lord may they find you today
[2:27:56] may they just say Lord I want to know
[2:27:58] you I just I want you I want to know you
[2:28:01] Lord maybe there's someone who's dealing
[2:28:03] with whatever it may be may we boldly
[2:28:05] come before the throne of grace Lord and
[2:28:07] say Lord I need you
[2:28:09] I need you Lord right now
[2:28:13] would you just speak to our hearts Lord
[2:28:18] sweetness of your presence
[2:28:20] may we just yield ourselves to you
[2:28:24] may we really
[2:28:26] truly do that so that we can have Unity
[2:28:29] with you that was Jesus's prayer Lord
[2:28:32] concerning us I believe that it is
[2:28:34] possible
[2:28:35] to me we have that
[2:28:36] [Music]
[2:28:38] deal with our hearts Lord I pray
[2:28:42] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:28:45] amen
[2:28:49] [Music]
[2:29:11] I keep it all to you
[2:29:15] [Music]
[2:29:33] know I Surrender my life
[2:29:39] [Music]
[2:29:45] amen
[2:29:48] [Music]
[2:29:50] I believe that
[2:29:52] God can speak to hearts in such a simple
[2:29:56] way
[2:29:59] and I believe that what brother
[2:30:02] Stephen said was solid stuff
[2:30:07] was good stuff
[2:30:10] take inventory of Our Lives oh God I
[2:30:13] want you to come down I want you to draw
[2:30:15] an eye but not not that close
[2:30:18] [Music]
[2:30:20] huh
[2:30:22] the guy in the mirror we can say that's
[2:30:25] me both that's me
[2:30:28] one saying not that close
[2:30:32] [Music]
[2:30:33] you understand
[2:30:36] he said why did God confound their
[2:30:38] language
[2:30:41] because what he did they could achieve
[2:30:43] anything
[2:30:44] [Music]
[2:30:45] because they're made in the image of God
[2:30:50] so God comes down can
[2:30:53] confuses their language
[2:30:57] and
[2:30:59] they are no longer unit unified under
[2:31:03] nimrods
[2:31:06] understanding his intent
[2:31:13] and
[2:31:14] he said people are people did you guys
[2:31:17] catch it huh
[2:31:19] now I'm sorry but you found out some of
[2:31:22] your people
[2:31:24] people got problems and people to get
[2:31:27] with other people got people problems
[2:31:29] and you have to deal with people issues
[2:31:35] now he said that the vertical Unity
[2:31:38] will take care of the horizontal Unity
[2:31:43] that's what the cross is all about you
[2:31:45] get right with God you get right with
[2:31:48] that Unity between you and God and the
[2:31:50] horizontal will find its balance
[2:31:53] [Music]
[2:31:55] I got to thinking about this language
[2:31:57] because the this message is actually a
[2:32:01] language
[2:32:02] [Music]
[2:32:03] we speak a language different than
[2:32:06] denomination
[2:32:08] [Music]
[2:32:10] it has within it a voice behind a voice
[2:32:14] it has an intent there that others
[2:32:18] cannot catch
[2:32:20] but when you hear it there's something
[2:32:22] inside that all of a sudden you catch
[2:32:25] the very mind of God the intent
[2:32:28] [Music]
[2:32:30] and that causes you to come into a Unity
[2:32:33] with God
[2:32:36] [Music]
[2:32:39] this message language actually
[2:32:42] brings us into the unity of the
[2:32:45] fellowship
[2:32:47] are you understanding that
[2:32:51] it'll bring us to the true Unity with
[2:32:55] God and create that total Fellowship
[2:32:58] that God had
[2:33:00] with those in the beginning
[2:33:06] Lord help us to hear the voice
[2:33:10] Behind The Voice
[2:33:13] amen
[2:33:14] [Music]
[2:33:17] I have a special prayer request this
[2:33:19] morning
[2:33:20] as a pastor I'm going to lay before you
[2:33:25] my daughter went to the doctor the other
[2:33:28] day she'd been having some stomach
[2:33:30] issues
[2:33:32] she's been diagnosed with colon cancer
[2:33:37] I go on Tuesday
[2:33:40] her mother and I go to Steve to speak
[2:33:44] with the oncologist and the surgeon
[2:33:49] but it is a darkness that has been
[2:33:51] placed before us
[2:33:57] and I'm going to ask all of you to be in
[2:34:00] prayer with us but as a pastor
[2:34:04] even my own family is not without the
[2:34:07] trials the issues
[2:34:09] but I believe that all things work
[2:34:11] together for the good to them or are the
[2:34:13] called according to his purpose
[2:34:16] didn't say it would be good didn't say
[2:34:18] but God will use it
[2:34:23] because God can use all things to work
[2:34:25] together for the good
[2:34:27] so I would like you all to remember
[2:34:31] my daughter Rebecca in prayer may God
[2:34:36] have his way
[2:34:39] in her life
[2:34:44] it is the goodness of God
[2:34:46] the Bible says it leads you to
[2:34:48] repentance
[2:34:51] and you know I've been praying for years
[2:34:53] oh God whatever
[2:34:56] it takes
[2:35:00] and now I don't want to say oh no oh no
[2:35:02] that that's a little too close
[2:35:07] I say draw me nearer
[2:35:10] Lord let my heart first be checked let
[2:35:13] me say oh God sanctify me consecrate Me
[2:35:17] O God
[2:35:20] amen
[2:35:22] so I wanted to share that with you you
[2:35:25] are my family
[2:35:28] We are family together and one one
[2:35:30] member suffers we all suffer
[2:35:35] so I wanted to
[2:35:37] share that with you I hadn't shared it
[2:35:39] with anyone outside my immediate family
[2:35:42] until this morning
[2:35:46] [Music]
[2:35:48] so I just request your special prayer
[2:35:52] brother Stephen
[2:35:54] you did a tremendous job this morning
[2:35:59] [Applause]
[2:36:07] [Music]
[2:36:09] I'd like to sing a song before we go
[2:36:12] because I believe it's very fitty once
[2:36:15] God sends his word out there it becomes
[2:36:16] a challenge to you then you have to have
[2:36:19] the courage to say okay I see something
[2:36:22] now give me the courage Lord to go ahead
[2:36:26] and do something about it I identify the
[2:36:29] problem how many of you can say amen
[2:36:31] amen I identify the problem now help me
[2:36:34] to have the courage
[2:36:36] to deal with that issue let's sing that
[2:36:39] song
[2:36:41] change my heart oh God oh God Is that
[2:36:44] the name of the song okay and brother
[2:36:47] Robert get your your amen yes because
[2:36:52] maybe it's your heart
[2:36:55] maybe is there something right there in
[2:36:57] the channel maybe there's a room there's
[2:36:59] a closet there's an area that you have
[2:37:02] just never let him
[2:37:04] ah lordy close but not not that close
[2:37:08] [Music]
[2:37:09] and maybe God is dealing with you in a
[2:37:12] very special way every one of you he
[2:37:14] deals with you uniquely
[2:37:16] because you know what you're all
[2:37:18] different
[2:37:21] so again I don't use a cookie cutter if
[2:37:23] you got to do this and you got to do
[2:37:25] that no what you do God deals with you
[2:37:28] uniquely the way it's dealt with you
[2:37:30] from your youth onward it's the same way
[2:37:34] he will continue
[2:37:37] so if he spoke to you in a special way
[2:37:40] you see this area
[2:37:42] then say Oh God give me the courage help
[2:37:45] me change my heart oh God yes Lord make
[2:37:48] it ever truth that's my desire God bring
[2:37:53] us you've given us a message language
[2:37:57] that we all speak and if you don't think
[2:38:01] it is in a different language talk to
[2:38:04] somebody out there that you talk about
[2:38:06] predestination election elect seed they
[2:38:09] got no idea you're speaking Greek to
[2:38:12] them
[2:38:13] what it is it's a language this message
[2:38:17] is God's language to you to let you know
[2:38:22] who you are and where you're from you're
[2:38:24] a part of him you always have been and
