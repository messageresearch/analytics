[26:43] vision to close to 100% vision. Well, 90
[26:46] on one, close to 100 on the other. So, I
[26:48] thank the Lord for that. I thank you for

[27:38] Austin, one more song here and let's
[27:40] change the order of the service as we
[27:42] get right into it because that's why
[27:44] we're here. We're here to hear the word.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all.
[27:52] Amen. Let's all stand. Amen.

[28:01] Above all powers,
[28:05] above [singing] all,
[28:09] &gt;&gt; above all nature and all created,
[28:17] above all wisdom, [singing and music] in
[28:20] all the ways of man,
[28:27] you were here before [music]
[28:29] the world began. Above
[28:34] all kingoms, [music]
[28:38] above all,
[28:42] above all [music and singing] wonderers
[28:45] the world has ever known.
[28:50] Above all wealth
[28:53] and [music and singing] treasures of the
[28:55] earth,
[29:00] there's no way to measure what
[29:06] for you were crucified, [music]
[29:12] laid [singing] behind a stone.
[29:15] Lord, you live [music] to die. [singing]
[29:20] Rejected and alone [music]
[29:23] like
[29:26] that was trampled [singing]
[29:27] on the ground. [music]
[29:31] You took a fall.
[29:35] Oh, and [singing] you thought [music] of
[29:36] me.
[29:40] [music]
[29:42] Glory. You were crucified.
[29:49] You laid behind the stone. [music]
[29:53] You live to die.
[29:57] Protected and Lord [music and singing]
[30:00] like the road
[30:03] that was on the ground. [music]
[30:09] to the fall
[30:12] [music] and he thought [singing] of me
[30:17] above [music]
[30:18] all.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; May God bless you. It's good to be in
[30:23] the house of the Lord.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; And we thank God for brother Ron giving
[30:27] us this opportunity to speak to you.
[30:29] Also, I'd like to introduce my wife
[30:32] that's here with me and two of the
[30:34] [music] saints from South Carolina.
[30:36] Praise the Lord.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, thank God for How many love
[30:39] the message of the hour?
[30:41] &gt;&gt; This is our day.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; Glory. We should be h happy. This is our
[30:46] time.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Glory. And you know what? Glory. One day
[30:50] we going to leave here.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; And it's looking like it's getting
[30:53] closer and closer to me.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God. We thank God for you. Uh we
[30:58] uh want to get right to the word. And uh
[31:02] I like have two pastor scriptures. We
[31:04] appreciate each and every one that
[31:06] pressed the way out. I know it's her
[31:07] first time. So you may be nervous and
[31:10] I'm nervous too. So when two omnipotent
[31:13] meet something have to happen.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. All right. If you have
[31:19] the book of
[31:21] 2 Kings
[31:24] and then we also be going to 2
[31:26] Corinthians
[31:29] 2 Kings 6 and let's start reading at
[31:32] verse 12.
[31:39] And one of his, excuse me, and one of
[31:41] his servants said, "Nay, my lord, O
[31:44] king, but Elijah the prophet that is in
[31:47] Israel, tellth the king of Israel the
[31:50] words that thou speaketh in thy bed
[31:52] chamber." And he said, "Go and spy where
[31:56] he is, that I may send and fetch him."
[31:59] And it was told him that behold he's in
[32:03] Dothan. Therefore send heed hither
[32:07] horses and chariots and uh great host.
[32:11] And they came by night and compassed the
[32:13] city about. And when the servant of the
[32:16] men of God was risen early and going
[32:20] forth, behold the host compass the city
[32:24] both with horses and chariots. And his
[32:27] servant said unto him, "Ali, my master,
[32:31] how shall we do?" And let's go to
[32:34] Corinthians, if you will.
[32:39] 4th Cor uh fourth chapter. Let's start
[32:42] at verse uh 17. 2 Corinthians 4:17. For
[32:47] our light afflictions, which is but for
[32:50] a moment, workketh for us a far more
[32:53] exceeding eternal weight of glory.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. While we look not at the things
[32:58] which are seen,
[33:00] &gt;&gt; but at the things which are not seen,
[33:03] for the things which are seen are
[33:05] temporal, but the things which are not
[33:08] seen are eternal.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Go to the message unseen as brother
[33:15] Brandon was sent here uh around about
[33:18] the sixth uh paragraph. He said,
[33:22] "Someone asked me not long ago said,
[33:25] "Brother Brandham, what do you think
[33:27] about the future?" He says, "I don't
[33:30] know uh what the future holds, but who
[33:34] holds the future?" So that's the thing.
[33:36] If I can keep acquainted with him,
[33:40] &gt;&gt; right? Praise the Lord. and uh like to
[33:43] drop down. He said, "I notice the point
[33:46] I want to say want to excuse me want you
[33:50] to see is that Elijah, the man who was
[33:53] of God, called the man of God. He did
[33:57] not look at the natural things. He
[34:00] looked at the supernatural things. He
[34:03] didn't look at what he seen. He looked
[34:06] at what he
[34:08] could not see. Did not see. And tonight
[34:12] Christian friends, he's speaking to us.
[34:14] Tonight Christian friends, we look at
[34:16] the unseen. That's just come to my mind
[34:19] while brother Baxter was given that
[34:21] wonderful exaltation concerning the
[34:23] supernatural. And the supernatural is
[34:26] what what do we see is what you believe
[34:30] and act on as though it was as was see.
[34:35] You see everything in the Christian
[34:38] armor is supernatural. We we not look at
[34:43] what we see. We look at what we do not
[34:47] see.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; You cannot be healed only through seeing
[34:51] at what you do not see. You can only be
[34:54] healed. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[34:56] Father, Lord, we need you to come. Move
[34:59] us out the way. Any man can turn the
[35:01] pages of the Bible. Lord, you said God
[35:04] Lord that if what is a gift is getting
[35:07] yourself out the way. So, Father, we
[35:09] thank you. Bless every heart here. Bless
[35:11] every soul. Bless the pastor. Strengthen
[35:14] us, Lord. And we can say after it's all
[35:16] said and done, did not our hearts burn
[35:18] within us as he talked with us along the
[35:20] way and open us to scripture.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You may be seated. I
[35:27] want to say uh for a subject if you
[35:30] will, because you don't see it, that
[35:32] don't mean it's not there.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; How many believe that? We look to the
[35:37] super sense. [snorts] We have a six
[35:39] sense.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; And sometimes, you know, as Christians,
[35:42] Glory, everything that a that a believer
[35:45] is based on what you cannot see. Glory.
[35:48] If you want to be healed, Glory, you got
[35:50] to see or believe that you are healed.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Faith find it final resting place on the
[35:55] word of God.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; And many in the Bible, you know, we
[35:58] speak of Elijah and and different things
[36:01] that took place. But you know with a
[36:03] believer faith come by hearing and
[36:05] hearing the word. And I know we know
[36:07] that we have in a great message. But you
[36:09] see sometimes the supernatural it looks
[36:12] like is not there but it's there. When
[36:14] you ask God for something you got to
[36:16] believe that he is
[36:18] &gt;&gt; and he is a rewarder of them that
[36:21] diligently seek him.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; You know I'm reminded of Simeon in the
[36:24] Bible. Just pray with me. I'm reminded
[36:26] of Simeon in the Bible when God told
[36:28] him, "You will not die until you have
[36:30] seen the Lord's Christ."
[36:32] Now, he had to take that word and
[36:34] believe it. Years went by, time went by,
[36:37] but Simeon understood something that
[36:39] WHEN GOD SPEAKS SOMETHING, IT'S GOT TO
[36:41] COME TO PASS.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; NOW, when you're here tonight, we
[36:44] believe this message. A lot of us been
[36:45] in the message a long time. Glory. But
[36:47] everything that Brother Brandham said,
[36:49] you can see it's coming to pass. Glory.
[36:52] You don't can't look at the things with
[36:54] the natural eye. You got to look that
[36:56] with the supernatural. See, and you're
[36:58] in church, Glory. It may be like, "Oh,
[37:00] I'm not getting away. I'm not growing."
[37:02] But something inside of you is changing.
[37:04] You're being changed from mortal to
[37:06] immortality. Though you may not look
[37:09] like it, glory, BUT INSIDE OF YOU, GOD
[37:12] IS TRANSFORMING us into his image. Cuz
[37:15] one day, we got to take a rapture.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Now, notice he says he don't look at
[37:20] things which are seen, but things which
[37:22] are not seen. And that's a Christian
[37:24] army. No matter what goes on or what
[37:26] happens, you see if God said it, you're
[37:30] going to believe it and WALK IN IT JUST
[37:32] LIKE it's already done.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; I heard I heard many times people said I
[37:36] uh like and especially I deal with a lot
[37:38] of people also that need immigration
[37:40] papers and so forth like that. I said,
[37:42] "Don't think I'm going to get my papers.
[37:44] You got to walk around say I possess my
[37:47] papers."
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Faith called those things as what? Not
[37:50] as though they were.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; And so forth. So you can't say, "Oh,
[37:54] I'mma get it. I'mma get it. I'mma be
[37:55] healed." You are healed. WITH HIS
[37:57] STRIPES, YOU ARE HEALED. See the super
[37:59] sense. Glory. We used to using the five
[38:02] senses and they come natural. Glory. But
[38:04] the super sense it come. You got to work
[38:07] on it. You got to make sure when God
[38:10] says it, you got to believe it. You
[38:12] know, Noah acted. God told him it's
[38:15] going to rain. Noah never seen no rain.
[38:17] He didn't know what rain look like. He
[38:19] didn't know what what when it's going to
[38:21] come. BUT ONE THING HE KNEW, GOD SAID,
[38:24] "IT'S going to rain."
[38:26] &gt;&gt; And Noah held to that. You know why?
[38:29] Because he was looking at things that he
[38:31] could not see. THOUGH HE DIDN'T SEE IT,
[38:34] he believed THAT IF GOD SAID IT, it was
[38:36] going to happen.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; So people got up. They probably got up
[38:39] each morning. Noah, I don't see no rain.
[38:41] Is that happening? But Noah knew. He saw
[38:44] every raindrop. He saw the time. Why?
[38:46] Because he wasn't waiting on it to come.
[38:48] He had already seen it by the
[38:50] supernatural. Let me just say this here.
[38:52] If you're sick of you need something
[38:54] tonight, YOU SHOULDN'T BE WAITING ON IT
[38:56] TO COME. YOU SHOULD SAY, "I ALREADY have
[38:58] it because you got to look to the
[39:00] unseen." Glory. Natural people, are you
[39:03] listening? Naturally, Glory, THEY LOOK
[39:05] TO NATURAL THINGS. WE COME FROM GOD. HOW
[39:07] MANY COME from God? How many come from
[39:09] God? We are predestinated. We are the
[39:12] word made flesh in this age. Glory. The
[39:14] bride is the word. So, she had become
[39:17] him. So when we when we look at we Jesus
[39:20] said I COME FROM GOD AND I GO BACK TO
[39:22] God and many people looked at him and
[39:24] said you know don't we know his father
[39:26] and mother he's down here his father
[39:28] make caption said but what he was saying
[39:30] was look you looking at me walking here
[39:33] on the earth you seeing what I've sent
[39:35] here to do but the real me glory the
[39:38] real me glory I COME FROM GOD AND I GO
[39:40] BACK TO God and you s you and ME AND THE
[39:43] BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST WE COME FROM GOD
[39:46] &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE GOING BACK TO GOD. This
[39:48] message came not to get a new group of
[39:51] people just to come. But it come to
[39:53] collect a group that WAS LOST BEFORE THE
[39:55] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. COME TO BRING
[39:57] YOU BACK TO YOUR POSITION in Christ.
[39:59] Glory. Not to a great church, not a
[40:01] great move, but to take seek and save
[40:03] those which was lost. How many know they
[40:06] was in the mind of God?
[40:07] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can realize that
[40:09] you was in the mind of God is the WORD
[40:11] THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SPOKE, GLORY, IT
[40:13] COME FROM THE MIND OF GOD. AND THAT SAME
[40:16] word that was predestinated TO YOU,
[40:18] THAT'S WHY YOU COME. GLORY. NO MAN CAN
[40:20] come except our drawing. Glory. You got
[40:23] to be looking at the supernatural. Noah,
[40:25] Glory, he kept no matter what people
[40:27] said, no matter what he went through and
[40:30] and so forth. We have our natural jobs.
[40:32] We have our natural things that we do
[40:34] and so forth. But one thing, Glory, your
[40:37] natural life is benefiting you here. But
[40:40] the supernatural life, glory, the inner
[40:42] man is going to benefit you on the other
[40:44] side. Glory. Are you listening now? You
[40:47] going to take, brother said, you're
[40:48] going to take something with you. The
[40:49] only thing you're going to take is your
[40:51] character. And we want the character of
[40:53] Jesus Christ.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Notice
[40:57] &gt;&gt; he took this text here and he looked at
[41:00] he says, "Listen, Elijah and notice
[41:03] Elicia, he came in and uh the the the
[41:07] Syrians every time they would something
[41:08] would go on. Let me just stop here.
[41:10] Every time Trump would do something, God
[41:12] already told us. [laughter]
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, let church say amen. Glory. So, it
[41:17] was in a day like that. Oh, don't get
[41:19] quiet. Biden or whoever. Glory. We ain't
[41:21] talking about Republicans and Democrats.
[41:23] We talking about believers.
[41:25] Everything that brother Brandham had
[41:27] prophesied. Glory. You know, mo, let me
[41:30] just say it like this. MODERN EVENTS
[41:32] BEEN made clear by prophecy. If it's 20
[41:36] years and from now, the modern event
[41:39] been made clear by prophecy. You ain't
[41:41] getting nothing new. GLORY. THE MODERN
[41:43] EVENTS. GOD HAD REVEALED it already.
[41:45] Glory.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Let church say amen. Glory. What is
[41:48] news? Glory. There's only one good news.
[41:51] Glory. We've been hearing all the time.
[41:53] The good news is the gospel. THAT'S THE
[41:55] ONLY NEWS it is. Glory. The good news.
[41:57] Glory. You go out there, you hear death,
[41:58] killing, murdering, hear people talking
[42:00] about one another, want to fight, want
[42:02] to kill. Glory. BUT WE HAVE A KINGDOM
[42:05] &gt;&gt; WHICH CANNOT BE MOVED.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE a kingdom. Glory. Hallelujah.
[42:10] That come from God. Glory. And all THE
[42:12] OTHER ONES GOING TO FALL AWAY. We have a
[42:14] future home. LISTEN. EVERYTHING ELSE HAS
[42:17] got to go. WHY? GOD HAS GOT TO renovate
[42:19] this place. Glory. It's it's it's not.
[42:22] In other words, it ain't fit for a
[42:24] believer to stay here. Glory. God got to
[42:26] change it.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; God got to completely renovate it. AND
[42:29] IF YOU LIKE THIS HERE HOME, I'M SORRY.
[42:31] GLORY. is getting ready to leave here.
[42:33] Glory. And God is trying to transform us
[42:36] into his image. WE HAVE SPIRITUAL FOOD,
[42:40] not natural food. Spiritual food in due
[42:43] season.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; This this came just in time. You know
[42:48] how many believe he's supernatural?
[42:50] &gt;&gt; I believe you supernatural. You in this
[42:52] message not because you so smart. Oh,
[42:55] you in here because I I'm not because I
[42:57] think I'm something or I'm special.
[42:59] Glory. the drunk on the street that got
[43:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He's just
[43:03] as special as you is to God. Glory. So,
[43:06] it's not by POWER NOR BY MIGHT, but by
[43:09] my spirit, says the Lord. Glory. It's
[43:11] God's spirit. Now, he told me to have my
[43:13] liberty and I'm going to preach like I'm
[43:14] home now. Praise God. It's not by power
[43:17] NOR BY MIGHT, BUT BY my spirit, say the
[43:19] Lord. AND GOD CALLED YOU. GLORY. He
[43:22] called me. He called the world. And the
[43:24] woman at the well. I know I'm going
[43:26] everywhere, but that's why I preach. You
[43:27] have to follow me. Glory. Glory. Let
[43:29] church. Amen. Glory. The woman at the
[43:31] well. Jesus went to the brother Brandham
[43:34] used it over and over again. The re the
[43:36] one of the reason why she's a woman at
[43:38] the well. But something was about her.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; She had a predestinated character.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; No matter her life was messed up, no
[43:46] matter she had five husband, but Jesus
[43:48] made it his business to go by Samaria.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Really, you might not believe it or not,
[43:54] but God made it his business to come by
[43:56] your house, too. Come by and see what
[43:58] you were doing. Lord.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; And when he went there and sat on the
[44:01] whale by the whale, go ahead. He was
[44:03] waiting on her to come.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; And he wasn't waiting to say, "Well, I
[44:06] don't know if she going to make it. I
[44:08] don't know." He knew everything about
[44:09] her. He was God. He was the word.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Woman, give me a drink."
[44:14] And the first thing she talked about,
[44:15] you being a Samaritan and you asking me
[44:18] to give you a drink. You know the Jews
[44:20] and the Samaritans don't have nothing to
[44:21] do with one another. But Jesus didn't
[44:24] follow that there. He said, "Listen, if
[44:26] you knew who was talking to you,
[44:28] &gt;&gt; let church say amen." You know what?
[44:29] SOME PEOPLE COME TO CHURCH AND THEY
[44:31] DON'T THEY THINK THE PASTOR talking to
[44:33] them sometime. IF YOU KNEW WHO WAS
[44:34] TALKING TO YOU, you would ask a hymn of
[44:36] living water
[44:38] &gt;&gt; and you never HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE
[44:39] WELL AND DRAW NO MORE.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; GLORY. WHEN YOU COME to church AND HEAR
[44:43] THE WORD IS MORE than a pastor. That's
[44:44] God speaking to you.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Glory. And she says, "Uh, you know, you
[44:49] don't have nothing to draw with. You
[44:51] trying to You don't have nothing to draw
[44:52] with." Glory. He says, "What, Glory?"
[44:55] "But you said something.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; YOU SAID SOMETHING THAT GOT my
[44:59] attention."
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Says, "Glory, you had some living water.
[45:03] Give me some of this living water." I'm
[45:05] just dramatized now. Give me some of
[45:06] this living water. He said, "Go call
[45:08] your husband." She said, "I don't have
[45:11] no husband." He said, "That's right. You
[45:13] got five husband and the one you're
[45:15] living with now, he's not your husband."
[45:17] SHE SAID, "SIR, SOME DEEP DOWN ON THE
[45:20] INSIDE, THE DEEP CALLING TO THE DEEP.
[45:22] SIR, I PERCEIVE THAT YOU ARE A PROPHET."
[45:25] &gt;&gt; GLORY,
[45:26] &gt;&gt; I know, glory, something is different
[45:28] about you. Glory. In other words, I've
[45:30] been going to church and I've been
[45:31] hearing about prophet, hearing about
[45:32] this and so forth, what a prophet would
[45:34] do and how would that. AND YOU TOLD ME
[45:36] SOMETHING THAT NOBODY ELSE KNOW.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; BUT GUESS WHAT? Something in her when
[45:41] they touch her, she begin to say, "Oh
[45:43] Lord, go ahead. Where is a PLACE OF
[45:46] WORSHIP?" EVERYBODY TELLING ME HOW TO
[45:48] WORSHIP GOD,
[45:49] &gt;&gt; saying go to this, go to the methodist,
[45:51] go to Baptist, go to IT'S GETTING NOW
[45:53] EVERYBODY GO TO this this message
[45:55] church, go to THAT MESSAGE. GO. YOU NEED
[45:57] TO GO TO JESUS CHRIST.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; HE IS THE WORD.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; GLORY. HALLELUJAH.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; And she said, "The time hour is come and
[46:05] now is the true worshipper shall worship
[46:08] the father in spirit and truth. For the
[46:10] father seeketh such to worship him." SHE
[46:12] THREW THAT WATER POT UP. ALL HER
[46:14] TROUBLES WAS OVER. She didn't have to
[46:16] worry about what group she on what
[46:17] Methodist, what she's a Baptist, WHAT
[46:19] SHE HAD MET THE WORD.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU MEET THE WORD, GLORY, THAT
[46:23] takes care of everything.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. He is the word. Do
[46:27] you believe that?
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; So when the when it says that the man
[46:30] that can tell you everything going and
[46:33] king now, he's a worldly king. He says,
[46:35] "I want to go get him." He said, "Where
[46:38] is he? Where is he at?" And so he got
[46:40] the army together, got there, and uh uh
[46:43] Elisha had a message believer that was
[46:45] following him. Glory. He was one of his
[46:47] converts in the church. Amen. And he was
[46:49] following Elijah. And when that when the
[46:52] enemy came, they surrounded
[46:56] and he says, glory, he said, "Oh,
[46:58] master." HE GOT UP EARLY IN the morning.
[47:00] Maybe he forgot to pray or something,
[47:02] you know. Glory. He got up early in the
[47:04] morning. He started looking. He saw the
[47:06] army round about. Everybody surrounded.
[47:09] He went to Elisha. He said, "Elish." He
[47:11] said, "Listen, listen." He says, "It's
[47:13] it's it's a army out there. We're
[47:15] surrounded. What we going to do?" And
[47:17] Elijah just stood back like I said to
[47:19] you. He said, "Listen, there's more with
[47:20] us than it is with them."
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "Wait a minute. What are you
[47:24] looking at? You see ALL THIS ARMY
[47:25] SURROUNDED BY?" BUT WHAT DID HE SAY?
[47:27] LORD, OPEN HIS EYES.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; He's seeing with his natural eyes. He's
[47:32] not seeing with his spiritual eyes.
[47:35] Sometime people can't get their BLESSING
[47:36] TO GOD BECAUSE THEY SEE with their
[47:39] natural eyes but the supernatural eyes
[47:42] see the unseen.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; It sees things that you don't let church
[47:46] say amen.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Do you know when brother Brandon was out
[47:48] there hunting? Glory. He was hunting and
[47:51] uh when he shot the silver tip g how
[47:54] many heard the story? You didn't heard
[47:55] of it. And as he's out there hunting,
[47:57] you know, he looked out there and he
[47:59] everything was just right. kill a
[48:01] calibou where but he got to the place at
[48:04] the end of the trip there was no silver
[48:06] tip grizzly he didn't kill and one of
[48:09] THE BROTHERS SAID BROTHER BRANDHAM you
[48:11] said that you was going to shoot a
[48:13] silver tip grizzly he said that's RIGHT
[48:15] GLORY HE SAID I CAN SEE BETWEEN here and
[48:17] the camp there ain't no SILVER TIP
[48:20] GRIZZLY NOWHERE let me just dramatize he
[48:23] said you looking with your eyes
[48:26] &gt;&gt; he said I can see between HERE AND THE
[48:28] CAMP THERE AIN'T NO SILVER tip grizzy
[48:30] nowhere And brother Brandham said,
[48:32] "Listen, Glory." HE SAID, "HE'S JEHOVAH
[48:34] GYRA."
[48:35] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT JEHOVAH GYRA? HE'S ABLE TO
[48:37] PUT ONE THERE. GLORY. IN OTHER WORDS,
[48:39] QUIT LOOKING AT EVERYTHING WITH YOUR
[48:40] NATURAL EYES and get sometimes IN THE
[48:43] SUPERNATURAL. WELL, GOD CAN BLESS YOU
[48:45] WITH WHAT YOU WANT. GLORY.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; And glory.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; He looked between the camp and all OF A
[48:50] SUDDEN THERE THE SIM GRIZZLY APPEARED.
[48:53] WHY? Because it WAS THERE ALL THE TIME.
[48:55] WHEN GOD SAID SOMETHING GOING TO HAPPEN,
[48:56] GLORY, IT'S going to happen.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Glory. If God say HE GONNA HEAL THE
[49:00] CANCER, it's going to be healed.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Glory. Notice everybody. He said, "SHOOT
[49:05] HIM, BROTHER BRANDHAM." HE SAY, "SHOOT
[49:06] HIM." HE SAID, "NO." In the vision, he
[49:08] fell down at my feet. Glory. That
[49:10] church. Amen. You just don't come to
[49:12] church. Jesus Christ is real. It's not
[49:14] just coming to church. People say, "Oh,
[49:16] I quit the me." You ain't quit the
[49:18] message. You never was in it. G. Oh, I I
[49:20] I'm going I'M G YOU CAN'T QUIT YOUR IN
[49:23] OTHER WORDS, YOUR DNA IS A part of God.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; G. You're a gene of God. Yes,
[49:28] &gt;&gt; you a part of God. Go ahead. Oh, I quit.
[49:30] GO AHEAD. HOW CAN YOU QUIT WHEN YOU COME
[49:32] FROM GOD and going back to God?
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus made it clear. YOU CAN'T TAKE MY
[49:37] LIFE.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; I HAVE THE POWER to lay it down and take
[49:40] it up again.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; You said, "But I have trials." Who don't
[49:42] have trials? Jesus had trials. Who don't
[49:45] have upsets and mistakes? Go. Jesus had
[49:47] them. Go. But one thing he had, he
[49:49] knowed that the word was profound. When
[49:52] that word when God said something, it
[49:54] had to come to pass. Don't matter how
[49:56] long it took. Do you believe that?
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Look at Abraham. Abraham staggered not
[50:01] the promise of God. We look at these is
[50:03] not Bible stories. How many know the
[50:05] Bible were read by was uh wrote by
[50:07] people?
[50:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible is Abraham life. The Bible is
[50:11] Job life. The message is me and your
[50:14] life and brother Brandham life.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. The word is in the
[50:20] bride. He is the secret. The word is in
[50:22] the bride. So now you feel like Jesus,
[50:26] you know, he was something supernatural
[50:27] and he was God wrapped in the flesh. But
[50:30] brother Brandham says he was 100% man
[50:34] and 100% God.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Glory. So he could be tempted just like
[50:38] you, just like me. But one thing he
[50:40] knew, he knew who he was.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; When you recognize your day, when you
[50:44] recognize who you are, Glory, are you
[50:46] listening? When you recognize who he is,
[50:48] the devil, oh, he going to fight you.
[50:50] But guess what? You going TO KNOW WHAT
[50:51] AUTHORITY YOU HAVE. GLORY. Are you
[50:54] listening? You can speak the word.
[50:56] Things going to go wrong. Glory. You can
[50:58] speak the word.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Say what you want and God is able to
[51:01] keep that which you have committed unto
[51:02] him.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; You know, I give you a testimony. Glory.
[51:06] I had a in 2021, I had a bad stroke.
[51:10] Glory. Let church say amen. Don't feel
[51:12] bad. I'mma tell you what God did. Glory.
[51:16] Amen.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; And when I had the stroke, praise God, I
[51:20] was just, you know, you know how to
[51:21] stroke do your mouth turd everything and
[51:23] so forth. And I had a karate, my car, my
[51:26] corateed artery was clogged, blood clock
[51:29] coming up to my brain. She didn't get no
[51:31] oxygen. So that's what made me go out.
[51:32] And I'm thinking, Lord have mercy. So my
[51:35] wife, I said, I wasn't going to doctor.
[51:37] And and uh this is just for just a joke.
[51:40] You know, all the saints come by,
[51:41] pastor, you need to go to the hospital.
[51:43] You need to go to the hospital. And I'll
[51:44] tell the church after I recuperate them,
[51:46] just get the head. I said, I know what
[51:48] to do when I want y'all to love me to
[51:49] get sick and let something happen.
[51:53] I'm just talking. Praise the Lord. So,
[51:57] so we got we got there. My wife said,
[51:58] "Go to all right." She took me to the
[52:00] hospital and I couldn't hardly move, you
[52:02] know, just messed up face and legs. I
[52:04] was weak. So, we went to the hospital
[52:06] and that following week, I went on a
[52:09] Monday if I'm not mistaken. Monday or
[52:10] Tuesday. So the following week I had to
[52:13] go I I had a meeting in Atlanta, Georgia
[52:16] was about three or four hours away. And
[52:18] then I said we have a church, a fellow
[52:20] associate church down there. So we got
[52:22] to got got to thinking. I went in the
[52:23] hospital. They they got me. They said,
[52:25] "Oh, they put me on. You know how they
[52:27] do. Put you on wires, grab everything.
[52:29] Yeah, you got you know, we got to get it
[52:31] up. We got to operate. We got to do
[52:33] this. We got to do that. Go." And I'm
[52:35] saying, "Don't don't get me wrong." I
[52:37] wasn't scared, but I said, "Lord, if
[52:38] it's time to go, I get on the other
[52:41] side, be on the curtain of time, I get
[52:42] to shaking hands with everybody. How
[52:44] y'all doing?" Glory. You believe the
[52:46] message?
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Glory. So, as I was standing there,
[52:49] Glory. And my wife was worried. You know
[52:51] how to do the children. They all come to
[52:53] the hospital. The doctor said, "We got
[52:54] to operate. We got to operate now." I
[52:56] said, "No, no, no, no." I said, "All
[52:58] right." He said, "Well, you need to be
[52:59] up." Said, "But I have a meeting." This
[53:01] is my mind thinking. I said, "I have a
[53:02] meeting this Friday." Amen. [laughter]
[53:05] Glory. I couldn't get my mind to think
[53:08] but on that meeting for real. I got a
[53:10] meeting Friday. I need that meeting. I
[53:11] got doctor said no you ain't you you you
[53:14] can't go to you need to be operated on
[53:16] now. So I waited waited kept on. Then I
[53:19] said no I think I want to make the
[53:20] meeting. I could hardly talk. The doctor
[53:22] said so he got me he got me upset. He
[53:25] said listen if YOU DON'T HAVE THIS
[53:27] OPERATION YOU GOING TO DIE. I said wait
[53:29] a minute the devil ain't going to push
[53:31] me around. Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; That's in my mind I thought cuz what's
[53:35] more important to me? Let me tell you
[53:37] what's MORE IMPORTANT IS THE WORD.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; GLORY. Let church say amen. I'm not just
[53:42] saying that. Glory. And after a while we
[53:44] got we he got to talk about I need this.
[53:47] I need that medicine. I got to have
[53:49] this. And he told me you're going to
[53:50] have to stay. I said how long? He said I
[53:52] don't know you going to have to stay in
[53:53] that. I said nah I can't stay in the
[53:55] hospital. I just can't. That was in my
[53:57] mind. So anyway everybody was telling me
[53:59] make a long story short everybody
[54:00] telling me you go ahead. you need
[54:02] operation need this that. So I got to
[54:04] thinking I said Lord and I ain't going
[54:05] to tell you I oh you prayed and the Holy
[54:07] Ghost dropped out. I was just as scared
[54:09] as anybody else. But but one thing I
[54:12] knew it was something in my heart
[54:14] telling me I needed to be at that
[54:15] revival. I don't know what it was or
[54:17] maybe just me. So anyway, I got up got
[54:20] kept going and then on Tuesday or
[54:22] Wednesday one day my wife knew to leave
[54:24] me alone. I said, "Bring my suit." Said,
[54:26] "Bring your suit." I said, "Bring my
[54:28] suit. Bring bring my clothes. I'm going
[54:31] to church. She said, "You ain't gonna
[54:32] make it." Then the doctor, you get all
[54:33] up there. Listen, you going to I said,
[54:35] "Bring my clothes, please. Glory. I just
[54:37] found you know how you found a piece."
[54:39] Now, if you don't have enough of faith
[54:41] like that, don't try it. Okay. Glory.
[54:43] Cuz you might die. [laughter]
[54:46] So, glory. So, I just kept bring my
[54:49] clothes. So, she finally brought my
[54:51] clothes up to the hospital. And then the
[54:53] doctor come in the room. He said, "Where
[54:54] you?" I said, "I'm going to the I said,
[54:55] "I'm going to go to the meeting this
[54:56] here this this weekend and I'll be back
[54:59] Monday." He said, "You ain't going to
[55:00] last for Monday. You going to die." I
[55:03] said, "And they kept on telling me
[55:05] that." And the devil tried to push that
[55:07] in my head, you know. So anyway, I
[55:08] finally got made. Everybody was telling
[55:10] me I start to get started. It was on
[55:12] Thursday. I started to go Wednesday or
[55:14] whatever. And they they said, "So my
[55:17] wife said, "You need to listen to what
[55:18] the doctors." I said, "No, once I get
[55:20] the meeting, I'll be all right. I'll
[55:22] finally, you know, I'll come back
[55:24] Monday." So anyway, I got I got uh got
[55:27] to thinking about it. So I got one
[55:29] brother, y'all. Everybody got like
[55:30] brother Brandham said, you got to have
[55:31] one nut. You know, you got to have one
[55:33] brother. Everything I don't care what
[55:35] happen. HE SAID, "GOD IS GOOD. GOD IS
[55:36] GOING TO HELP YOU. DON'T WORRY. LOSE
[55:38] YOUR MONEY, GOD IS GOING TO HELP. GO GET
[55:40] SICK. GOD IS GOOD. GLORY." So I said, "I
[55:42] call this brother. If I call him
[55:46] and he tell me to stay in the hospital,
[55:47] [laughter]
[55:49] then I know, glory, I know that I'll
[55:52] stay in the [laughter] hospital." So I
[55:54] call up, my wife look at me. She calls.
[55:56] He said, "You know, brother," I said,
[55:57] "I'mma call brother. I'mma call brother
[55:59] Jacob." So, I called him up and I said,
[56:02] "Pastor," I said, "I heard you." He
[56:04] said, "I heard you in the hospital." HE
[56:05] SAID, "PASTOR, YOU DON'T NEED TO BE
[56:06] THERE. YOU GOT THUS SAID THE LORD. YOU
[56:09] GOT THE WORD. YOU GOT THE POWER OF GOD.
[56:11] DON'T LET THE DEVIL KEEP YOU. I'M
[56:12] TELLING YOU, GOD DIDN'T HEAL YOU
[56:14] ALREADY."
[56:15] &gt;&gt; And he was, "Boy, when he was getting
[56:17] fired up, I was getting fired up cuz,
[56:19] you know, just it just does something to
[56:21] me, you know." Glory. And he said he was
[56:23] fired me up. My wife said, "Oh no, you

[56:30] time K get A FLAT TIRE, GOD GOING TO FIX
[56:33] THE TIE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. It's got
[56:34] me going." So when he said that, I said,
[56:37] "That's it." I had already told my wife.
[56:39] I said, "If he says,"I said, "I'm going.
[56:41] I'm getting out." So I came to the
[56:42] doctor. I came that was Wednesday or
[56:44] Thursday. I don't know. So I came to I
[56:46] said, "Listen, doctor, I think I'm going
[56:47] to go. I'm going to check out. I'll be
[56:49] back Monday." He said, "I told you, Mr.
[56:51] prepared. Y'all pastors think y'all
[56:53] can't die. I said, "Who this man talking
[56:55] to?" He was just talking like, "But I
[56:58] knew it was the enemy." Then then he
[56:59] said, "Listen," I said, "I'll be back
[57:01] Monday to get the operation." He says,
[57:03] "YOU AIN'T GOING TO MAKE it back Monday.
[57:06] I doubt if you make it to the tomorrow."

[57:10] blood and cuz I in and out. In and out.
[57:12] But anyway, make a So, so I said, "Well,

[57:16] And you know what the doctor looked at
[57:18] me? HE SAID, "I AIN'T GIVING YOU NO
[57:20] MEDICINE. YOU GO OUT THERE AND SIGN
[57:22] YOURSELF OUT. I SAID, "WHAT kind of
[57:23] spirit is this?"
[57:25] I thought he was a doctor want me to
[57:27] live. He said, "He wouldn't give me no
[57:28] medicine. She'll tell you he wouldn't
[57:30] give me nothing." So, I said, "I'm going
[57:32] anyway." Praise God. I was weak coming
[57:34] out the hospital, you know. So, I got
[57:36] there, got it, got my wife drove me. I

[1:00:17] in the message of grace? Brother
[1:00:19] Brandham talked about how a mosquito
[1:00:20] beat him in the eye.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; How many know that? You read that
[1:00:24] message somewhere. I believe I got it
[1:00:25] right. Glory. He said, "Well, and so I
[1:00:27] was in South Africa. I went in South
[1:00:29] Africa and I was preaching and it's this
[1:00:31] lady. I stayed at a brother's house and
[1:00:34] uh they said his wife examined
[1:00:37] mosquitoes and stuff. She do you know
[1:00:39] they make them where they go out to uh
[1:00:41] kill other bugs or whatever you say. And
[1:00:43] she come and I was telling about she
[1:00:46] said do you know something brother
[1:00:47] Benny? I said no. She said do you know
[1:00:49] mosquitoes have that something in their
[1:00:51] body when they get ready to bite you?
[1:00:53] They inject something in you to thin
[1:00:55] your blood out. I said, "Praise God."
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Glory. God can do anything. If he can
[1:01:01] take he can take hornets to run people
[1:01:05] off. Glory. He can do what he want to
[1:01:07] do. Glory. Now, it sound like a paradox
[1:01:09] to you, but it's true anyhow. WHAT IS A
[1:01:12] PARADOX? IT'S SOMETHING THAT DON'T SEEM
[1:01:14] TRUE, but it's true anyhow. And I never
[1:01:16] I should tell you I never went back to
[1:01:18] the hospital again after I left there.
[1:01:19] They didn't even do nothing TO ME. WHAT?
[1:01:21] GOD OPERATED on me. And we have a he is
[1:01:24] there no bomb in Gilead? Is there no
[1:01:27] position in the land? Then why not the
[1:01:29] daughters of my people here? Sometimes
[1:01:31] are you listening now? Sometimes we get
[1:01:34] so caught up into the natural things we
[1:01:36] see that the supernatural THINGS THAT
[1:01:37] COME FOR US. WHAT IT NEED TO BE THE
[1:01:40] NATURAL things come far into us and the
[1:01:42] supernatural things the things that are
[1:01:44] unseen should be more real to you than
[1:01:46] the things that are seen.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; When they went to go
[1:01:53] get a king. God sent his prophet,
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; glory to get a king and he went to the
[1:02:00] house of Jesse. And he got to the house
[1:02:03] and when he got there, he started, you
[1:02:07] know, said, "God sent me here to your
[1:02:09] house to you have a king in your house
[1:02:12] and it's looking good." He bought the
[1:02:13] first barn. You know, he went brought
[1:02:15] the elegant, bought the best one. He
[1:02:17] bought the one that he thought should
[1:02:18] be. He bought some, he bought another
[1:02:20] one. and he bought all eight sons. And
[1:02:24] the prophet said, "Listen, you know, I I
[1:02:26] know God spoke to me and told me that
[1:02:29] you had a sick king in your house and
[1:02:30] I'm dramatized. DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE
[1:02:32] CHILDREN?"
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; And Jesse said, "Yeah, I got one, but he
[1:02:38] just don't seem like his mind, right?
[1:02:40] I'm just giving it. He be out there
[1:02:43] singing the sheep. He'd be out there
[1:02:45] praying to the sheep. He'd be running
[1:02:47] the sheep and everything. that what kind
[1:02:50] of king would he make? Glory. But God
[1:02:52] SAMUEL SAID, "LISTEN, I CAN'T SIT DOWN
[1:02:54] and eat this sacrifice until he come
[1:02:56] in."
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; And when David came in the house, THE
[1:02:59] ANOINTING OF THE PROPHET AND DAVID start
[1:03:02] the deep call to the deep. They were
[1:03:04] singing. And Samuel took that all he
[1:03:06] question about it. HE SAID, "THE
[1:03:08] ANOINTING IS ON HIM." YOU KNOW WHY? Cuz
[1:03:10] the same spirit that was upon David was
[1:03:13] upon GOD HIMSELF. AND GOD GLORY ANOINTED
[1:03:15] HIM TO BE THE KING.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; WHY? It wasn't because he was smart.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Wasn't because he was great.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; It was because God had ordained him so.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Glory. Let me let me say this here.
[1:03:26] We're here. We're not sitting here
[1:03:28] because we nice. We're not sitting here
[1:03:30] because we deserve it. We're sitting
[1:03:32] here by the grace of God.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; You are saved by grace through faith,
[1:03:37] not a work. There ain't nothing you can
[1:03:38] do,
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; but it's the gift of God.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We thank God because he
[1:03:44] could have chose anybody,
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; but he chose you and me. He could have
[1:03:47] elected anybody, but he chose us. Glory.
[1:03:50] Why? Because he saw something in you.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Glory. He saw his own life
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; inside of you.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Glory. One time David one time when when
[1:04:00] uh when John the Baptist, he was sitting
[1:04:04] coming down and he was in prison.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; How many heard the story?
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; John was in prison and he was he got a
[1:04:11] little discouraged
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; like we all do. Amen.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; But God never forget when he called you,
[1:04:17] he predestinated you. He going to save
[1:04:19] you. He'll keep you.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; He always give you something to make
[1:04:22] sure, glory. No matter how much the
[1:04:24] devil fight you, no matter how much he
[1:04:26] try to get you down, God always make a
[1:04:28] way to take care of his children.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; And while John was in there, he's
[1:04:34] getting ready to get his head cut off.
[1:04:35] He done had done,
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; you know, done all this work that God
[1:04:38] had him to do. And he was sending there.
[1:04:41] And so he got a little discouraged and
[1:04:43] he called two of his disciples.
[1:04:45] Not that he didn't believe the message,
[1:04:48] not that he didn't believe Jesus Christ
[1:04:51] was the word, but it was so much
[1:04:53] pressure on him that he forgot what it
[1:04:55] was all about.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Glory. Sometimes, you know, people uh
[1:04:58] this last day, brother Brandham, he
[1:05:01] said, "This is not me.
[1:05:03] God is using my voice.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; God is speaking through me." Go ahead.
[1:05:07] Are you listening? It was just a man. It
[1:05:10] was God's voice. Glory. He was yielding
[1:05:12] himself. Well, God can speak. And John
[1:05:15] the Baptist looking. He says, "Uh uh,
[1:05:17] go." He called his disciples. He said,
[1:05:19] "Go and ask him, is he the one
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; or do we look for another?" Now, that's
[1:05:24] in the word because John was actually
[1:05:26] feeling that way. Maybe I I maybe I got
[1:05:29] the wrong one. Maybe it's so because
[1:05:31] listen, Herod is getting ready to cut
[1:05:32] his head off. So, he had a lot of
[1:05:34] pressure. Glory. Sometime pressure when
[1:05:36] the squeeze come. How many know when the
[1:05:38] squeeze come you don't watch who you are
[1:05:40] you watch the third pull then glory when
[1:05:42] the squeeze come
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; and John was under he was under squeeze
[1:05:46] and said listen glory make sure you go
[1:05:48] ask I need to know uh uh is he the one I
[1:05:51] got to understand is he the one so John
[1:05:54] disciples they decided they go and uh
[1:05:57] and uh they go down there to Jesus meet
[1:05:59] and they asked Jesus himself they came
[1:06:02] to Jesus and said John sent us to ask
[1:06:05] you are you the one or do we look for
[1:06:08] another? Jesus never even answered that
[1:06:10] question.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "Y'all sit down here in the
[1:06:13] service.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Watch the word. Watch the service. Watch
[1:06:16] what the scripture say supposed to
[1:06:18] happen. Watch what the word say supposed
[1:06:21] to take place. If I'm the right one,
[1:06:23] God." So, what happened? He healed the
[1:06:25] sick, cast out devils, speak to the
[1:06:27] spoke to the poor, the blind, and healed
[1:06:29] the heal the sick, cast out devils. And
[1:06:32] when he went back there, go Jesus never
[1:06:34] did tell him what, you know what he
[1:06:36] said? Go tell John the things that
[1:06:38] you've heard and seen.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; See, because he know John was a
[1:06:43] scriptural person. He wasn't a glory
[1:06:45] some kind of theological teaching. He
[1:06:47] was a scriptural man. And when he could
[1:06:49] see it in the word, he knew. Glory
[1:06:52] glory. So when Jesus knew that if he see
[1:06:55] was fulfilled in the word, the
[1:06:56] fulfillment, that's all it would take.
[1:06:58] Let me tell you something. Glory. bride
[1:07:00] Jesus Christ. It once you f see the
[1:07:03] fulfillment of the word, glory, you know
[1:07:05] that the message is thus sayith the Lord
[1:07:07] and right.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; And I was out here uh last year and I I
[1:07:11] rode in one of those cars going down,
[1:07:14] you know, going down the road with
[1:07:15] nobody in it. I felt like I was riding
[1:07:17] in prophecy.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all think it got old, but it
[1:07:20] ain't old. Glory. Hallelujah. I got in
[1:07:23] there and I said, "This is what my
[1:07:24] prophet was talking about. I've heard of
[1:07:26] it, but now I see." Glory. See, and
[1:07:29] sometime we let we as human beings, we
[1:07:32] let things go fast and get get old. No
[1:07:34] sir, this message must not become
[1:07:36] common. It is something that
[1:07:38] predestinated to get YOU UNTIL YOU MAKE
[1:07:40] THE RAPTURE. GLORY. You dig in the word.
[1:07:43] Read your Bible and pray. Seek God
[1:07:45] because what? That's what's going to
[1:07:47] hold you. Glory.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; And John when they came back to John,
[1:07:51] John saw his disciples. He said, "WHAT
[1:07:53] DID HE SAY? What did he say?" They said,
[1:07:56] "You know what? problem. Oh, John, you
[1:07:58] just DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT DID HE SAY? IS
[1:08:01] HE THE ONE? OH, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
[1:08:04] HAPPENED. JOHN, WE WERE SITTING in that
[1:08:05] service. Glory. The blinded eyes were
[1:08:08] open till he turned his back and said,
[1:08:11] "Who do you say this is? I'm just giving
[1:08:13] example." HE TURNED HIS BACK. HE start
[1:08:15] telling everything about JOHN JUMPED UP
[1:08:17] SAID, "OH, GLORY TO GOD." THEY SAID,
[1:08:19] "WHAT'S WRONG, JOHN?" Go ahead. Let
[1:08:20] Harry come on and cut my head off. That
[1:08:22] was him. I knew I was in the right
[1:08:25] message. I understand what it said.
[1:08:28] Glory. What was it? He wasn't just
[1:08:30] getting a place where you know, oh, you
[1:08:33] know, it's just so boring. When you come
[1:08:34] to church, listen, when you come to
[1:08:36] church, you should be excited.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Well, you should come in there. Glory.
[1:08:40] Hallelujah. Why? Because part of you
[1:08:42] listen,
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; if you understand, Glory, I believe what
[1:08:47] Jacob did, Jacob understood he could see
[1:08:51] the benefits of the birthright.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Esau never saw it. Right. That's right.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; All Esau saw is, man, my daddy's going
[1:08:58] to just bless me and, you know, I'm
[1:09:00] going to get the house, I'm going to get
[1:09:01] the car, and I'm going to get this and
[1:09:02] that. Not Jacob.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Jacob wanted the birthright.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; The birthright WAS ALL THE SPIRITUAL
[1:09:09] blessings that went along with what
[1:09:10] Isaac had said.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; And Jacob kept on going, kept on going
[1:09:15] until one day, Esau decided he wasn't
[1:09:18] coming to church. He quit reading the
[1:09:19] message. HE WAS HE SAID, "WHY don't you
[1:09:21] let let me have your birthight?" Esau
[1:09:23] said, "Listen, I need two Cadillacs and
[1:09:26] five or 10, 20 houses." Glory, you can
[1:09:28] have a verse right right now. Glory.
[1:09:30] I'll get it back later. [laughter]
[1:09:32] Glory. The church say, "Amen." But Esau,
[1:09:35] Glory, he didn't understand or see how
[1:09:39] important a birthight. You know how
[1:09:41] important the Holy Ghost is to you. That
[1:09:43] is your birthright. That is your
[1:09:45] lifeline. That ain't that that's what
[1:09:47] YOU NEED TO HOLD ON TO GOD. GLORY. YES.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; And one day, Esau came. He He hadn't
[1:09:53] been to church in about six, eight
[1:09:55] months.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; And when he came home, he came to
[1:09:57] church. Jacob said, "Listen, let me have
[1:09:59] a birth. What are you going to do with
[1:10:01] me? I'm hungry." HE SAID, "SELL IT TO
[1:10:03] ME. Let me have it." All right. YOU CAN
[1:10:04] HAVE IT. LITTLE DID HE KNOW THAT HE
[1:10:07] didn't see he did not see the spiritual
[1:10:09] application behind the birthight.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Are you listening? And he got rid of the
[1:10:14] things that he needed. glory in that
[1:10:17] this world and in the world to come. And
[1:10:19] when it got to a place, Glory, he
[1:10:21] realized what he done. All the crying,
[1:10:24] all the repenting he could do, it done
[1:10:26] him no good. You know why? Cuz Glory,
[1:10:29] Brother Brandham says he despised it.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Glory. He might have just said, "I give
[1:10:33] it up. There ain't nothing to it."
[1:10:34] Glory. You know, the Holy Ghost, I come
[1:10:36] in the message. Ain't nothing to it. I
[1:10:38] get back to it. Glory. But Esau despised
[1:10:40] it. He said, "Listen, it ain't nothing.
[1:10:42] Glory. Let me TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOUR
[1:10:44] MESSAGE is everything you need. Jesus
[1:10:47] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:10:50] forever. Don't let nobody tell you, God,
[1:10:52] oh, IT AIN'T NOTHING TO IT. THIS IS YOUR
[1:10:54] LIFE. THIS IS YOUR WORD. THIS IS WHAT
[1:10:56] GOD SENT TO GET YOU INTO THE RAPTURE.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; And Esau,
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; that's the truth, brother.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Glory. It came to place. Glory. Jacob
[1:11:06] got in trouble and everything. Guess
[1:11:08] what God did? Jacob went through all
[1:11:11] kind of troubles. went down to uh Laban
[1:11:13] and so forth. You know what he went
[1:11:14] through? He make it short. And one day
[1:11:17] when Jacob was coming home,
[1:11:20] something in him,
[1:11:22] he wanted to go back to the place where
[1:11:24] he was. He wanted to be close to God.
[1:11:27] And that birthright was the avenue to
[1:11:31] which he could be close to God because
[1:11:32] it was a pass. How many know he was a
[1:11:34] part of Abraham and Isaac? Glory. And
[1:11:36] Jacob, you know, he want that birthight
[1:11:39] so bad. Go ahead. And when he got to a
[1:11:42] place, he was coming home. He wanted to
[1:11:44] come home. He wanted to come back to his
[1:11:46] place where uh back to his homeland for
[1:11:49] so forth. And he got to a place he got
[1:11:51] he he knew Esau was going to kill him.
[1:11:53] But he says, "If I could get back,
[1:11:55] glory, I want to go back." So he sent
[1:11:57] his one drove over, he sent another
[1:11:59] drove, and he sent somebody else. AND
[1:12:01] JACOB WAS LEFT BY HIMSELF, ALL ALONE BY
[1:12:04] HIMSELF.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; And Jacob was wondering, glory, he got
[1:12:08] to praying and he got desperate. Glory.
[1:12:10] Now, are you listening? Now, the
[1:12:13] birthright is getting ready to kick in.
[1:12:15] Glory.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There he was. He got to
[1:12:18] praying. Oh, Lord, please Lord, Esau
[1:12:20] going to kill me. Lord, I want this. I
[1:12:22] wanted, you know, just praying. And all
[1:12:24] of a sudden, a angel come down.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; And when that angel come down, glory.
[1:12:28] Hallelujah. And Jacob grabbed a hold.
[1:12:30] Listen, let me just go. You got to be in
[1:12:33] the unseen.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; He grabbed hold to an angel. He grabbed
[1:12:38] that angel and THEY WAS RASLING. HOW
[1:12:40] MANY BELIEVE THAT? GLORY. If you believe
[1:12:42] it, say amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Glory. He grabbed hold to that angel and
[1:12:46] he held him and he was holding him. He
[1:12:47] was holding him. He was holding. He was
[1:12:49] ras. He said, "Let me go." AND THE ANGEL
[1:12:50] IS TALKING, "LET ME GO. LET ME GO."
[1:12:53] JACOB SAID, "NO, I AIN'T LETTING GO. I
[1:12:55] GOT A HOLD OF WHAT'S RIGHT. I GOT THIS
[1:12:57] PREDESTINATED WORD. I ain't gonna let it
[1:13:00] go until you bless me."
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't let go.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; And angel said, "Listen, it's getting to
[1:13:06] break a day. I'm supposed to be seen at
[1:13:07] the break of day. Jacob said, "But you
[1:13:09] ain't blessed." He says, "All right,
[1:13:10] Glory. Let me give you something. You're
[1:13:13] Jacob. You a shite. You You're wicked.
[1:13:15] You evil. You you you d." He said, "I
[1:13:17] tell you what, I'm changing your name."
[1:13:19] MY GOODNESS, GLORY. HE changed his name.
[1:13:21] And that name is PULATED OUT THROUGH
[1:13:24] HISTORY. WHAT IT WAS? Because he saw the
[1:13:27] supernatural, the unseen, that he was
[1:13:29] able to wrestle with that angel.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Glory. I wonder how you think Billy Paul
[1:13:36] felt when brother Brandham looked at
[1:13:37] said, "Do you want to see
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; want to see that angel?"
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Glory. That should make you want to be
[1:13:43] more. How many know the angels of God
[1:13:46] encamp round about them
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; that fear him?
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Glory. Listen, we're here. Because you
[1:13:53] don't see something, that don't mean
[1:13:55] it's not here. The rapture is here.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Glory. The bride is here.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; She is the words. She been made
[1:14:02] manifest. Glory. And when I like that
[1:14:05] part when Elijah come and says, "Lord,
[1:14:07] open the young man eyes." You know what
[1:14:08] he had to do? Change the way you seeing
[1:14:11] things.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Sometime you come to church. Glory. You
[1:14:14] don't see all the wicked, all this
[1:14:15] wrong, that wrong. Change the way you
[1:14:17] seeing things. And then watch the
[1:14:19] supernatural kick in.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Glory. Notice.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Noah. What about Abraham?
[1:14:27] And I'm Well, he took Isaac. He took
[1:14:30] Isaac. God told him to offer him up for
[1:14:32] a burnt offering for sacrifice.
[1:14:35] What in the world would a man should
[1:14:38] offer up his only son? But see, the
[1:14:41] prophet said
[1:14:43] he had received him as one from the
[1:14:46] dead.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; And he knew that God, if you gave him
[1:14:50] one FROM THE DEAD, GOD was able to raise
[1:14:52] him up from the dead and he killed him.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he wasn't looking at the HE WAS
[1:14:56] LOOKING AT THE UNSEEN.
[1:14:59] He was looking at God things that he
[1:15:01] could not see.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Most of the time people and how many
[1:15:04] know we're the mess of the hour.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; What we need to be doing now is looking
[1:15:08] at the things that we can't see. THE
[1:15:09] RAPTURE IS SOMETHING THAT is here. You
[1:15:11] can't see it. The change of the body is
[1:15:13] here. Uh let me just say it like this.
[1:15:15] Let me go. Brothers in this room right
[1:15:17] now. G. There's objects moving around.
[1:15:19] G. Do you know that Moses voice is here?
[1:15:22] Different things right there. It's in
[1:15:24] the unseen. You got to have something to
[1:15:26] see it. Glory. Television can pick up
[1:15:29] different things, BUT YOU AS THE HOLY
[1:15:31] GHOST, YOU CAN PICK IT UP. GLORY.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; So when he took Isaac, praise God. God
[1:15:38] bless you. When he took Isaac, praise
[1:15:41] God. That's when I'm preaching the young
[1:15:42] brothers up front. I be pointing. I
[1:15:43] said, I'm pointing way in another world.
[1:15:45] Glory. Glory. Amen. So don't get don't
[1:15:48] get nervous.
[1:15:50] Abraham.
[1:15:52] Glory. He took Isaac.
[1:15:56] when he took Isaac
[1:15:58] and he to offer him up for a burnt offer
[1:16:00] of sacrifice. Listen, we hear this all
[1:16:02] the time. God is to Abraham believed
[1:16:06] that Isaac was as good as dead.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; So when he took him up there, Glory, he
[1:16:11] was looking to the unseen. I don't know
[1:16:14] how. Are you listening? How many read
[1:16:15] the word? Glory.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; He says, "We we are going up there and
[1:16:20] we coming back."
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; But that's what he's supposed to kill
[1:16:23] him. Yeah,
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; he had already faith find a resting
[1:16:26] place on the word. So when he got up
[1:16:28] there, he got the wood,
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; he got the sacrifice, he got everything.
[1:16:32] Got the wood, the fire, the burnt
[1:16:34] offering. AND ISAAC HIMSELF SAID,
[1:16:35] "FATHER, I SEE ALL THESE THINGS. WE GO
[1:16:37] TO CHURCH. WE BELIEVE THE MESSAGE. WE
[1:16:39] FOLLOW THE MESSAGE, BUT IT AIN'T LINING
[1:16:41] UP WITH WHAT YOU SAID."
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAID, "LISTEN, GOD, GLORY,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; are you listening?
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; God had already told Abraham, Glory,
[1:16:50] that he was gonna have to offer him up.
[1:16:52] So God said, "And I I personal pronoun
[1:16:56] God said, and I will be the sacrifice."
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; So how is God going to be the sacrifice
[1:17:02] with your glory? He said, "I've
[1:17:04] sacrificed myself." Y'all understand? So
[1:17:06] Abraham, praise God, when he when he got
[1:17:09] ready to take cut Isaac throat, put the
[1:17:11] knife in his hand coming down to the and
[1:17:13] the angel of the Lord said, "Abraham,
[1:17:16] Abraham, stay your hand. NOW I KNOW YOU
[1:17:19] BELIEVE ME."
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YEAH.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; And guess what? There was A LITTLE RAM
[1:17:25] CAUGHT OVER IN THE BUSH. BROTHER BROWN
[1:17:26] SAID, "WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?" GOD
[1:17:28] HAD PLACED IT THERE. HE'S JEHOVAH GYRA.
[1:17:31] GOD WILL provide for. And let me TELL
[1:17:32] YOU SOMETHING. GOD WILL PROVIDE YOU.
[1:17:34] WHAT'S THIS? TWO 2025. I don't care
[1:17:37] WHAT'S GOING ON, GOD STILL PROVIDE FOR
[1:17:39] HIS CHURCH. ANYTHING THAT SHE NEED, GOD
[1:17:42] WILL PROVIDE FOR HER AND TAKE CARE of
[1:17:44] her. Amen.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; That's good, brother.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; I had a brother. I was in I was in I
[1:17:49] think I was in Harlem five years. Five
[1:17:51] years. He's waiting on his papers and
[1:17:53] and we just got was just preaching. I
[1:17:55] just said, "Listen, God, the king heart
[1:17:58] is in the hand of the Lord.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; He turned it the way he want to."
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; We sometime we ask good that's good
[1:18:04] asking people when you ask God then you
[1:18:06] let God work on it. And anyway, I was
[1:18:09] preaching a young man as he come up the
[1:18:11] al says, "I've been praying for my
[1:18:13] papers for five years and I never got
[1:18:15] them." He says, "And I'm going have to
[1:18:17] go back to I said,"Well, we'll pray. I
[1:18:19] don't know what to do." I said, "But
[1:18:20] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:18:22] today, forever. He can provide. This is
[1:18:24] this this happened about five years ago,
[1:18:26] four years ago." And he says, uh uh that
[1:18:30] after he came to service, he got prayer,
[1:18:31] prayed for him. He went back, I suppose,
[1:18:34] fly out on that Wednesday. Tuesday, he
[1:18:37] came SCREAMING OUT TO GOD. SAID, "OH, I
[1:18:40] GOT MY PAPERS. I GOT MY PAPERS." AND
[1:18:42] GUESS WHAT? The man told him they've
[1:18:44] been sitting on my desk for two weeks,
[1:18:46] but it took God to take him and make him
[1:18:48] get him off the desk and get him in his
[1:18:50] hand.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; I tell you testimonies after testimony,
[1:18:56] but what I want you to do, we look to
[1:18:58] the unseen.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; We look to what we can't see. And
[1:19:02] because you don't see it, that don't
[1:19:05] mean it's not there.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; How many time remember brother Brad was
[1:19:08] praying for a lady?
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Glory. And she had went to the doctor.
[1:19:11] They couldn't find find out what was
[1:19:12] wrong with her. What's wrong with what's
[1:19:14] wrong with this? And kept on asking.
[1:19:16] They couldn't find and then she came to
[1:19:18] brother Brandham and brother Brandon was
[1:19:20] praying for her. She was getting cancer.
[1:19:21] He says, "Listen, you hid from the
[1:19:24] doctor, but you can't hide from God."
[1:19:26] That's right. HE
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; IT HADN'T EVEN GOT THERE YET. But the
[1:19:28] prophet REALIZED THAT THAT WAS TRYING TO
[1:19:31] COME INTO HER LIFE. AND HE rebuked that
[1:19:33] curse in the name of JESUS BEFORE IT
[1:19:34] EVEN GOT to her body.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; How many remember that?
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Glory. What what he was doing? He was
[1:19:40] looking to the unseen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Glory. Sister had it right. Why she got
[1:19:46] her children saved.

[1:19:52] story about silver tip grizzly. given
[1:19:54] the story about all the things that was
[1:19:55] happening and sister had it right said
[1:19:58] brother Brandham that's nothing but THE

[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen let you go listen he says here
[1:20:25] when Jacob wrestled with the angel and
[1:20:27] I've said this before but I want to read
[1:20:29] this here quote he said the birthright
[1:20:31] was connected to his are you listening
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; his calling what God wanted
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; this message connects you to heavenly
[1:20:42] beings
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; this message connects you to the rapture
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; all that was in God he poured it into
[1:20:48] Christ
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; and all that was in Christ he put it in
[1:20:51] the church
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; glory He I want to be saved. Glory. If
[1:20:55] you were saved, you were saved from the
[1:20:56] foundation of the world. He said, well,
[1:20:58] repent,
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Gloria.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; We had to stop baptizing in the name of
[1:21:03] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:21:05] sin. You shall receive the gift of the
[1:21:07] Holy Ghost. I was building a new church.
[1:21:09] Brother Ron, I thank God for him coming
[1:21:11] out praying for it. Praying for us. And
[1:21:13] while I was out there on the laid the
[1:21:15] foundation, I had a contractor. I had
[1:21:18] five contractors. Look, you know how
[1:21:19] they each one get the different prices
[1:21:22] of her. But the fifth one came and he
[1:21:25] was talking about, oh, he loved the Lord
[1:21:27] and he loved the Lord Jesus. And he
[1:21:28] start talking about. So I start
[1:21:30] witnessing to him about brother
[1:21:32] Brandham. He says, you know, I can't
[1:21:34] understand my Bible. He said, I read
[1:21:36] about it. I read it. It don't make sense
[1:21:38] to me. I said I said, have you received
[1:21:40] the Holy Ghost? Did you believe?
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; I just just testing the waters. He says,
[1:21:46] yeah, I mean, I got baptized. said, "How
[1:21:48] were you baptized? Father, Son, and Holy
[1:21:50] Ghost." So, I took him to Acts 2:38. I
[1:21:52] said, "Repent and you shall receive the
[1:21:54] gift of the Holy Ghost." I said,
[1:21:56] "Without the Holy Ghost, you can't under
[1:21:58] God uh reveals himself by revelation is
[1:22:01] not read until it's not read." He said,
[1:22:03] "Who do men say that I am? Son, the
[1:22:06] Christ, the son of the living God." He
[1:22:07] said, "Blessed are thou shalt Simon by
[1:22:09] Jonah." What happened after I told him
[1:22:11] that? He says, "Listen, can I I I want
[1:22:14] to be baptized." So I took them in
[1:22:16] baptized him in the name of the Lord
[1:22:17] Jesus Christ and the contract he tell me
[1:22:19] let me tell you what he said I would
[1:22:21] help you build help you build your
[1:22:22] church I do that that's not why I
[1:22:24] baptize God had you to come to me to get
[1:22:27] your life straight right I said what you
[1:22:29] want to do is up YOUR BUSINESS BUT MY
[1:22:31] BUSINESS WAS GOD'S BUSINESS AND that's
[1:22:32] to get you on the right track
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; he said thank you thank you pastor ever
[1:22:37] since then glory he been calling me and
[1:22:39] I've been sharing sharing the sharing
[1:22:41] the message with him glory and finally I
[1:22:44] got a to open up the serpent seed. And
[1:22:46] he said, "Man, I ain't never heard
[1:22:47] nothing like this." And I let him know.
[1:22:49] I said, "That didn't come from me. God
[1:22:50] sent a prophet."
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; And he promised that he'll send you
[1:22:54] Elijah. And I asked him, "Have you
[1:22:56] Elijah?" He said, "Where is that?" I
[1:22:57] took him to Malachi 4. I said, "This is
[1:22:59] for you. This is personally for you."
[1:23:02] And you know what, glory? You know what
[1:23:05] happened? They made him a deacon in his
[1:23:08] Baptist church. They made [laughter]
[1:23:10] they they made him a deacon. They told
[1:23:12] him he could preach. He called me a
[1:23:13] preacher. I said, "I you if God ain't
[1:23:15] call you, you going to be cursed." He
[1:23:17] said, "Well, they want me to preach and
[1:23:18] do something." I said, "You better be
[1:23:20] cursed." I said, "What the devil is
[1:23:21] doing is trying to trap you in the
[1:23:23] system." He said, "Yeah, I see it. I see
[1:23:25] it." He said, "But what I'mma do, my
[1:23:27] wife," he said, "my wife lead the
[1:23:29] choir." I SAID, "COME OUT OF HER, MY
[1:23:31] PEOPLE. AIN'T NO EXCUSE. BE NOT
[1:23:33] PARTAKERS OF THEIR sin that you receive
[1:23:35] not of." You can't compromise with the
[1:23:37] devil. Glory. When you look into the
[1:23:39] unseen, glory, when you're looking at
[1:23:40] what GOD SAID, GOD PROMISED is unto you,
[1:23:43] to your children, all that above. We are
[1:23:45] here in this message, not because of us.
[1:23:48] It's because God predestinated us before
[1:23:51] the foundation of the world. And he
[1:23:53] called you bride. God bless you. God
[1:23:56] bless you. Glory. Listen. Just because
[1:23:58] you don't see it, that don't mean it's
[1:24:00] not there.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Glory. Heavenly Father, as we bow our
[1:24:04] heads, listen. I don't want to keep you
[1:24:06] long.
[1:24:09] Lord, this is a church here. We had
[1:24:11] evening light tabernacles. It's like a
[1:24:15] that little girl,
[1:24:18] Lord, that she went down there as a man
[1:24:19] that can turn on the lights. Father, I
[1:24:22] pray that you bless this church.
[1:24:25] Bless the pastor. Thank you, Lord, for
[1:24:28] your grace.
[1:24:30] And Lord, we try to say what you placed
[1:24:32] upon our heart, Lord. But my main main
[1:24:36] subject and thing that I want today is
[1:24:38] this. Glory. We just can't look at
[1:24:40] things as natural that we see every day
[1:24:42] in our lives. Lord, angels is around us.
[1:24:47] When Gahaza looked, he saw angels round
[1:24:50] about in the in in the mountains.
[1:24:52] [music]
[1:24:53] Lord,
[1:24:55] we just like Mary. The word has come to
[1:24:57] the bride, Lord. and brother Brandham as
[1:25:00] you bought the message. It was to bring
[1:25:02] us into [music] into into the
[1:25:05] supernatural things and and the third
[1:25:07] pool and the Lord glory and he asked
[1:25:11] Lord before when Mey was sick before the
[1:25:13] doctor touch her let it be gone Lord
[1:25:17] because he knew Lord that your word
[1:25:21] you are a God. You take these natural
[1:25:24] things and you bring us into the
[1:25:27] supernatural. Move them out the way that
[1:25:29] Lord, we have some trust with angels in
[1:25:32] another dimension. We are here [music]
[1:25:35] because we come from God and we're going
[1:25:37] back to God. Lord, bless this church in
[1:25:39] Jesus Christ's name. [music] Amen. God
[1:25:42] bless you. God bless you. Praise the
[1:25:44] Lord. [applause]
[1:25:46] Appreciate this. Thank you, Lord.
[1:25:47] Brother Ron, God bless you. [cheering]
[1:25:50] Praise God. God
[1:26:05] Because you don't see it doesn't mean
[1:26:09] it's not there.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Too much of the time it is our carnal
[1:26:14] eyes.
[1:26:15] It is. We're trying to understand a
[1:26:18] realm that we will never understand
[1:26:22] through these five senses.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brennham says, "God gives to
[1:26:27] the elect seed a super sense."
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; The super
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; he says, "What is that super sense?"
[1:26:32] It's faith.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; And faith is a gift of God. How do I get
[1:26:36] more faith? Faith cometh by hearing.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; People don't realize you want more
[1:26:41] faith.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Then you got to do more hearing. Amen.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; That's why we come to church. That's why
[1:26:47] we fellowship together. That's why we
[1:26:49] read.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Why? Faith cometh by hearing, hearing
[1:26:53] the word of God.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother uh Benny, for
[1:26:57] taking the word and giving us different
[1:26:59] examples and going here and here and
[1:27:02] there and
[1:27:05] [music]
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; all of the scripture.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:10] It reveals
[1:27:13] things that were not.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Abraham was given a promise.
[1:27:21] He's going to have a seed.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; But it took 25 years.
[1:27:30] And when the condition got so bad
[1:27:34] that his body and his that of his wife
[1:27:37] Sarah was dead also.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Did that stop God?
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; And Abraham believed God and it was
[1:27:47] imputed unto him for righteousness.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; What God expects you to do is not to
[1:27:56] produce the word Yes,
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; just believe it.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Let God bring it to pass.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; He's the one who will do it.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; He said it. I believe it. That settles
[1:28:08] it.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together this evening.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[1:28:17] Let's sing that song. Open the eyes of
[1:28:19] my heart, Lord.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Open the [singing] eyes of Come
[1:28:27] on.
[1:28:30] Open the [singing] eyes of my heart.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; I want to see [music]
[1:28:37] you. [singing]
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; I want to see [music and singing]
[1:28:43] you once again.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Open [singing]
[1:28:48] the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[1:28:54] Open [singing and music] the eyes of my
[1:28:56] heart.
[1:28:58] I want to see you.

[1:30:20] heart.
[1:30:22] Oh, I want to see you.
[1:30:27] Oh, I [music and singing] want to see
[1:30:30] you.
[1:30:33] Oh, [music] see [singing] you high and
[1:30:36] lifted up.

[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see [music]
[1:31:02] you.
[1:31:06] I want [music and singing] to see you.
[1:31:10] M
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; you know saints sometimes
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; we miss seeing him
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; and he's walking right there with us.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; The two on the road to Emmus.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Emmas means earnest desire.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; And here it was God fulfilling his word.
[1:31:30] These are disciples.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; They knew Jesus.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; And here it was. They were all
[1:31:36] discouraged and downtrodden like [music]
[1:31:39] some of us get.
[1:31:41] We don't see God, you know, we've asked
[1:31:43] for this, we've asked that, and we
[1:31:45] thought this should have come to pass.
[1:31:47] We thought this and that.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Sometimes God goes contrary to our
[1:31:52] understanding.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; And there he had an invisible union. He
[1:31:57] joined himself to them. And he began to
[1:32:01] from the scriptures [music]
[1:32:03] go back into the Old Testament and he
[1:32:06] talked about all the scriptures that
[1:32:08] pertained to him and what he was going
[1:32:10] to do. He was taking modern events
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; and making them clear by prophecy.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Their hearts be to burn.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "And their eyes were
[1:32:21] holding that they did not see him.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; And he was right there with them.
[1:32:28] help us.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And the day was far
[1:32:34] spent."
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; And Jesus made as though he would go
[1:32:38] further.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Sometimes he says, "I I just got to keep
[1:32:43] going." And he wants you to ask him,
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; "Stay here with me." [music]
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; You know, if you don't ask him and if
[1:32:52] you don't persevere and you don't see
[1:32:54] God, listen, he's God.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; He doesn't play games. Amen.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; So they compelled him and said, "Stay
[1:33:00] here with us. The day is far spent."
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; And he sat down and he took bread and he
[1:33:07] break it.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; And when he took, now remember now,
[1:33:13] let's go back to the scriptures. Jesus
[1:33:15] said, "I am the bread which comes down
[1:33:17] from heaven."
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; So the bread that he broke, there was a
[1:33:21] natural bread there, but he broke
[1:33:23] something else.
[1:33:25] He broke the word of God and unveiled
[1:33:28] their eyes and all of a sudden they saw
[1:33:30] him.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; They got so excited they run all the way
[1:33:37] back. But God, what he does now watch
[1:33:40] this.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; You when you're going through a trial
[1:33:44] and a test, quit looking with natural
[1:33:47] eyes.
[1:33:50] Get alone with God
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; and ask God, God, I know there's more in
[1:33:56] the supernatural realm around me. I am
[1:33:59] encompassed
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; by hope
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; host of angels.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; And then let God open your eyes
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; and then you realize, wow, [music]
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; wow. But then what God does once he
[1:34:14] shows you he's here,
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; he pulls back into that supernatural
[1:34:18] realm.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; He pulls back. Then you don't see him.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Not with the natural eye.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, they from that day
[1:34:34] forward.
[1:34:36] Never would look again with such natural
[1:34:40] eyes.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. God help us
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; that we quit looking at the things which
[1:34:45] are around us with carnal eyes,
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; but we begin to look at spiritual things
[1:34:50] that are happening all around us. And
[1:34:52] I'll tell you what, it will give you a
[1:34:54] revival.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Thank you for
[1:34:59] coming to the house of the Lord tonight.
[1:35:01] God bless each and every one of you. And

[1:35:23] dismissed. [music] Help me out here.
