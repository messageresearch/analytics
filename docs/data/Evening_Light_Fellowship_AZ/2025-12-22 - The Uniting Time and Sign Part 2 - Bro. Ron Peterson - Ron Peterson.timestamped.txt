[12:02] process successfully the last five
[12:04] months. I had very little side effects
[12:07] when there were many side effects, but I
[12:10] had very little. The Lord my savior,
[12:13] he's my husband. He met every need that
[12:15] I had along the way
[12:18] spiritually.
[12:20] monetarily, medically, excellent
[12:22] doctors, excellent care team, personal
[12:25] needs, the healing touch of my body, and
[12:27] many miracles. And I want to thank and
[12:30] appreciate all of the love and support
[12:32] and the prayers of the saints here at
[12:34] Evening Life Fellowship
[12:36] and across the world and also for my
[12:38] family and my friends. I am in the last
[12:40] phase of the building back of my immune
[12:43] system and I've I have felt every prayer
[12:46] during this journey and I have felt and
[12:49] I've been showered with love and grace
[12:50] and I want to thank every one of you and
[12:52] may the Lord richly bless you. Let's
[12:54] remember her. The Lord will continue to
[12:56] be with her as her healing touch. I want

[13:02] well. Do you have a need today?
[13:07] The song says he's got healing in his

[13:11] &gt;&gt; Healing in his hands. And that healing
[13:15] is for you and I today. What is your
[13:17] need today? Let's sing it one more time.
[13:19] Who walks on the waters? Who speaks to
[13:22] the sea? If you need healing today, lift
[13:25] your hand towards his head because his
[13:28] hand is outstretched to you and I.
[13:29] Brother Andy Manara, lead us in prayer.
[13:32] Oh, who walks on the water, who to the
[13:38] sea,
[13:40] who stands in the fire beside

[13:54] and he carries my healing in his hand.
[14:00] His name is Jesus.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together.
[14:09] Lord, we thank you that you gave us a
[14:12] privilege
[14:14] that we could speak your name.
[14:18] Lord, I think there's only one language
[14:21] for that name.
[14:23] But Lord, in our
[14:26] this physical carnal body, we lack a a
[14:29] language, Lord, to worship you properly.
[14:36] Lord, give us ears to hear today,
[14:40] hearts to receive.
[14:43] Lord, I when I think of Sister Nancy's
[14:46] praise report,
[14:51] &gt;&gt; I think of those who've gone through
[14:53] great trials.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, there's some of those probably
[14:58] know you in a better way than some of us
[15:00] that haven't been through those things.
[15:05] probably walk very close to you, Lord,
[15:08] in times of trial.
[15:12] Lord, we have those cliches, but some
[15:15] Let us count our blessings.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; If all we had was your name,
[15:25] &gt;&gt; salvation,
[15:28] &gt;&gt; that would be enough.
[15:31] Lord, bless your people today,
[15:33] worldwide. And Lord, bless Brother Ron.
[15:36] Let him speak that language. Lord, that
[15:39] would touch hearts. Lord, I pray that
[15:41] there's fertile ground here today. Lord,
[15:44] that maybe we've been tried and tested
[15:46] and we need to hear something.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray you'd be mindful of all
[15:51] the prayer requests, Lord. Turn them
[15:54] into a glorious praise report just like
[15:56] Sister Nancy's.
[15:58] Father, we give this service to you.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; We came here for a purpose.

[28:46] to carry your victory.
[28:50] Perfection could never earn it. You give

[30:24] seated
[30:26] in the heavenly place undefeated
[30:30] with the one who has conquered it all.
[30:38] And when I lift my voice and shout,
[30:43] every wall comes crashing down. I have
[30:48] the authority
[30:52] that Jesus has given me.
[30:57] When I open up my mouth, mira.
[31:05] I have the authority
[31:10] that Jesus has given me.

[35:25] in the manger
[35:27] of my heart.
[35:35] God bless you.
[35:58] There are times in this life
[36:03] when fear is so heavy. Heavy
[36:08] and burdens
[36:11] weigh on your mind.
[36:17] You are weakened
[36:20] need and no strength can you find.

[36:49] your body,
[36:54] &gt;&gt; he is the mountain you be standing on.
[37:02] I know you can see all the tears falling
[37:08] down.
[37:11] I'm so glad he sees what we don't.
[37:23] I've seen his children walk through
[37:29] the darkest of midnight.
[37:33] I've witnessed faith put to the test.
[37:40] I have watched as the storms flowing
[37:46] with the thunder.
[37:49] But in each trial, he knows what's best.
[37:55] And I am so glad
[38:00] he knows what's best.
[38:05] And though you may see
[38:09] your valley,
[38:14] he is the mountain you'll be standing
[38:19] on.
[38:21] When all you can see,
[38:25] tears falling down.
[38:30] I'm so glad he sees what we don't.
[38:39] He knows the end from the beginning.
[38:47] He looks ahead past the hurt and the
[38:52] pain to a place where the peace passes
[38:58] all understanding.
[39:04] He sees the sun through the rain.
[39:11] I know you may see
[39:15] your valley.
[39:19] He sees the mountain you be standing on.
[39:26] When all you can see are the tears
[39:31] falling down.
[39:35] I'm so glad he sees what we don't.
[39:43] And though you may see
[39:47] your valley,

[43:03] Awesome.
[43:07] Amen.
[43:11] Amen. God bless you this morning. I
[43:13] greet you all this morning in the lovely
[43:17] name of Jesus Christ.
[43:19] Today is going to be a little bit of a
[43:21] different service.
[43:24] And so I want all of you to kind of bear
[43:27] with me. Um and and so we have a few
[43:32] other things that we'll do here prior to
[43:35] us going directly to the word. And um so
[43:41] uh
[43:43] the last couple weeks now we've had a
[43:46] wedding each week
[43:49] and uh
[43:52] so I wanted to show you a couple
[43:54] pictures because some of you let's show
[43:58] um brother Noah and sister Clarissa.
[44:02] Yeah. Uh they were married last week and
[44:06] they have moved to Holland and sent me
[44:09] the note that they have arrived safely
[44:11] and in their new home and and so they're
[44:15] we pray that they'll live happily ever
[44:17] after.
[44:19] Amen. Amen. Then the next is uh we had
[44:23] one yesterday. Brother
[44:26] Alexis and sister Grace got got married
[44:29] and uh so uh we had the wedding here
[44:34] yesterday and it was quite nice. And uh
[44:37] we were getting ready I wanted to say
[44:42] and give them the Bible and and say
[44:44] goodbye to them and we went out to the
[44:47] parking lot and as I was out in the
[44:49] parking lot um they had not left and he
[44:53] had a I think a Corvette or something
[44:57] that they were going to drive away in
[44:59] and uh he started that thing up
[45:03] I jumped. My goodness. That because it
[45:06] was so
[45:10] what in the world. Anyway,
[45:13] uh after you have weddings,
[45:16] if there is a union that takes place and
[45:19] it is fruitful, it brings forth
[45:21] children.
[45:24] See, God expects you to bring forth
[45:27] fruit
[45:29] &gt;&gt; if you've had a union with him. Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; He does expect fruit.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; And uh so uh we have uh this morning
[45:42] here a baby dedication. Actually, we
[45:44] have two dedications
[45:46] this morning. So I'm going to read from
[45:49] Matthew chapter 19 and then we'll sing
[45:52] the song and and uh we'll have
[45:56] brother Andrew Kennedy and Sister Anessa
[46:00] to come.
[46:01] It says here in Matthew chapter
[46:04] 19:13-15.
[46:15] Then were there brought unto him little
[46:17] children that he should put his hands on
[46:19] them and pray. And the disciples rebuked
[46:23] them.
[46:25] But Jesus said, "Suffer, little
[46:26] children, forbid them not to come unto
[46:28] me, for such is the kingdom of heaven."
[46:31] And he laid his hands on them and
[46:33] departed then. Amen. Let's sing that
[46:37] song. Bring them in. Bring them in.
[46:38] Bring the little ones to Jesus. Oh,
[46:41] bring them in.
[46:44] Bring them in.
[46:47] Bring them in from the fields of sin.
[46:53] Bring them in.
[46:56] Bring them in.
[47:00] Bring the little ones to Jesus.
[47:08] Amen.
[47:12] Amen. Come on up here, brother Andrew
[47:15] and Sister Anessa. Amen. Praise the
[47:18] Lord.
[47:20] Yeah. Look at this.
[47:25] Oh my
[47:28] brother Andrew,
[47:31] God has given you and sister Anessa
[47:34] another love gift
[47:37] because of a fruitful union.
[47:41] And in the days of Christ,
[47:45] they wanted to bring the little children
[47:52] See how important it is not only that
[47:54] you name your child properly,
[47:58] but you bring and you dedicate them
[48:00] because you know what? We need help.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; We need help in raising our children,
[48:06] especially in this age. And so the very
[48:08] best thing you can do is to bring them
[48:10] and dedicate them to the Lord.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; And so that's what we'll be doing here.
[48:15] And they have named
[48:17] their little son Cyrus.
[48:21] Revan. Is that how you say it? Revan.
[48:24] Cyrus.
[48:25] Revan. And Cyrus means heir to the
[48:27] throne. Wow.
[48:32] This is good. And it even gets better.
[48:35] And they said that biblically Cyrus as
[48:38] you know was uh called Cyrus the Great
[48:41] divinely appointed as a ruler who
[48:43] allowed the Jewish exiles to return
[48:46] home.
[48:48] So this Cyrus
[48:50] is
[48:51] on a journey going to return home also.
[48:55] Amen. And revan means to celebrate or to
[48:58] rejoice
[49:00] in in Hebrew, but in French it means to
[49:04] return or to come back. In Irish it
[49:07] means kingly.
[49:10] So may all of these meanings reflect
[49:15] the son's little character.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; May he be heir to the throne.
[49:26] And may he celebrate
[49:28] and rejoice in his return.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; All right, turning the other way. There
[49:39] we go.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Oh, he's all dressed up with a
[49:45] bow tie here. Everything.
[49:49] His little shoes on.
[49:56] He looks quite healthy.
[50:01] He's heavy.
[50:04] He's how many pound? 12 pounds already.
[50:09] Oh my.
[50:11] Praise the Lord.
[50:14] Just come over a little closer if you
[50:17] would. Right here. I would like all of
[50:19] you to bow your heads now if you would.
[50:24] Heavenly Father,
[50:27] I hold in my arms this little love gift
[50:30] that you have given to brother Andrew
[50:31] and sister Anessa.
[50:34] You have placed this little son into
[50:37] their family.
[50:40] And therefore, there's a great
[50:42] responsibility now for
[50:45] this family to raise this child in the
[50:47] nurture and admonition of God.
[50:51] I pray, oh heavenly father, that you
[50:54] will allow Cyrus to become heir to the
[50:57] throne
[50:59] and may he rejoice forever because he's
[51:02] returning back to where he come from.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; I pray heavenly father that you will
[51:07] bless him all the days of his life, oh
[51:09] God, because you said that you have
[51:12] watched over us from our birth until the
[51:15] time we go home.
[51:16] So I pray that you will watch over his
[51:20] uh his feet where they go, his eyes what
[51:22] they see, and his ears what they hear.
[51:25] May he be part of that bridal company at
[51:27] the end time, Lord,
[51:30] that will be ready at your coming.
[51:31] Father, I bless Cyrus, Reverend now back
[51:36] to you for a life of service.
[51:40] Bless this family now with this son in
[51:43] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[51:47] Amen. Amen.
[51:51] He's a cutie.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. God bless you. Thank you.
[51:57] God bless you. Yeah. God bless you, too.
[51:59] Yeah. Yeah. I got a blessing from there.
[52:04] Amen.
[52:06] And brother Martin Malumba and Sister
[52:09] Grace have got a little son they want to
[52:14] bring now. So if they would come at this
[52:16] time, let's sing that song once again.
[52:19] Yes. Bring them in.
[52:23] Bring them in.
[52:26] Bring them in from the fields of sin.
[52:32] Bring them in.
[52:35] Bring them in.
[52:38] Bring the little ones to Jesus.
[52:47] Amen.
[52:56] God bless you, brother Martin. Sister
[52:58] Grace, God bless you richly. So God has
[53:02] given you a little son.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Look at that smile.
[53:10] And they have named him
[53:14] Daniel Kabika
[53:19] Malumba.
[53:20] And they've given me the definitions of
[53:23] all three names. Daniel means God is my
[53:25] judge
[53:27] or
[53:29] a judge of God.
[53:34] Kabua
[53:36] means
[53:38] one who forgives
[53:40] or one who is forgiven.
[53:45] Not only who forgives but one who is
[53:48] forgiven because it's upon condition if
[53:51] you forgive others.
[53:54] Amen.
[53:56] And malumba means he who gathers for
[54:00] fellowship.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[54:04] This boy has already come into this
[54:07] world judged of God
[54:10] &gt;&gt; to be forgiven
[54:13] &gt;&gt; so he could gather together for
[54:15] fellowship.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Wow. That that that's powerful. I don't
[54:19] know about you, but that that is
[54:21] powerful. I appreciate it. So we are so
[54:25] thankful that God gives to us love gifts
[54:30] and then he requires us as parents that
[54:33] we raise our children in the admonition
[54:36] and nurture of God. Teach him his ways.
[54:44] Show them. Show him how much that you
[54:48] love him.
[54:51] because you must lead by example.
[54:55] We don't want to say we love God and
[54:56] then live differently.
[54:59] But we want to show our life and how
[55:04] much that we love God and that we're
[55:06] happy in doing it.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "Happy are you if you keep my
[55:10] commandments." So, we're happy for that.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, may I have little uh Daniel
[55:17] Kabika?
[55:19] Yeah. Okay. Let's turn him the other way
[55:21] here. There we go. Oh, yeah.
[55:29] Look at all of that hair.
[55:33] Huh?
[55:36] Oh, yeah. There we go. He's Oh, yeah.
[55:52] Can you all see him?
[55:55] He's just relaxed.
[55:58] He's in the arms of a shepherd
[56:02] like his father. Yeah.
[56:06] Let us all bow our heads if you would
[56:08] please.
[56:10] Our kind heavenly father, as we have
[56:13] gathered here this morning and also to
[56:17] have the time of dedication of this
[56:19] little love gift that you have given to
[56:23] brother Martin and sister Grace and
[56:26] father, the fruit of their union has
[56:29] brought forth a son.
[56:31] They've asked him that he would be a
[56:35] judge for God, that he would be judged
[56:37] of God. And a judge always brings a
[56:41] verdict.
[56:43] And the verdict is
[56:46] that he is forgiven.
[56:52] And therefore, because he's forgiven,
[56:54] there is fellowship.
[56:57] Because the fellowship was broken in the
[56:59] garden, but now it's being restored back
[57:03] again.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; We're going back to Eden. Father, I pray
[57:08] for little Daniel Kiba Malumba. I now
[57:12] dedicate you back to God.
[57:16] The life that came from God is now going
[57:19] back to God. And so therefore, Father,
[57:23] we place him into thy hands and ask that
[57:26] you will take this little son and let
[57:29] him be father
[57:32] a great judge for God between right and
[57:35] wrong. I pray that you will bless him
[57:37] all the days of his life, health and
[57:40] happiness. May he be a son that will
[57:44] bring honor to his father and mother. I
[57:47] thank you and I praise you. I ask this
[57:49] for your glory in Jesus Christ's name.
[57:53] Amen.
[57:54] Amen. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Help me
[57:59] here. Oh, yeah.
[58:07] Yeah. God bless you, brother. Sister
[58:10] Grace. God bless you richly. Amen. Thank
[58:13] you.
[58:21] Amen. I'm looking for Sister Julie Aila.
[58:24] Is she here? Sister Julie. Are you here
[58:27] this morning?
[58:31] Sister Julie Aila,
[58:33] as you know, has moved back here to to
[58:36] Phoenix.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[58:40] &gt;&gt; You haven't seen her this morning. She's
[58:42] getting prepared. Her son Josh,
[58:45] as you know, has had jaw surgery, ear
[58:48] surgery, and everything to help. He's
[58:51] had some hearing problems and different
[58:54] things. And some complications have
[58:57] arisen from the surgery.
[59:01] And I thought if she was here this
[59:02] morning that we would have her to bring
[59:06] little Josh forward because tomorrow she
[59:09] drives back to Colorado.
[59:12] the operation has created a little bit
[59:15] of an infection and the infection she
[59:18] went to the emergency room to have the
[59:21] doctors here look at it and they said we
[59:23] recommend you go back to the doctors who
[59:25] did the surgery that sort of thing so
[59:27] they kind of know the situation and let
[59:30] them deal with it so um let's just bow
[59:33] our heads now as we pray for so that's
[59:36] okay we'll wait until these brethren get
[59:39] seated here God bless them.
[59:43] Let's pray for a moment. Heavenly
[59:45] Father,
[59:46] it is upon my heart to pray for little
[59:49] Josh.
[59:51] Lord, you know the operations, you know
[59:54] the situation and the enemy has come and
[59:57] tried to bring some infection to create
[59:59] a a problem. Father, I'm asking as she
[1:00:03] goes back to the doctors who did the
[1:00:06] operation tomorrow and she's going there
[1:00:10] so that they can deal with that. I pray
[1:00:12] that you will first off touch Joshua,
[1:00:15] Lord. I pray that when he goes there,
[1:00:18] they might not even find an infection.
[1:00:20] Father, because you're the same
[1:00:22] yesterday, today, and forever. You're a
[1:00:24] God that meets every need. I pray that
[1:00:27] you will bless little Joshua, Sister
[1:00:30] Julie, as she drives back to be with
[1:00:32] them. I pray in Jesus Christ's name,
[1:00:35] claiming a victory for your glory.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Also, yes. Also, yeah. Brother
[1:00:44] Steve,
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; would you come up here, please?
[1:00:50] You all know Brother Steve is a veteran.
[1:00:57] He was in military service.
[1:01:00] He knows what it's like to be in battle.
[1:01:04] And he's still a soldier. Come up here,
[1:01:05] Brother Steve.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. H
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; hard to get up, isn't it?
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; If I don't fall.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; And brother Steve, come on over here and
[1:01:18] share with us. You're you're going to be
[1:01:20] leaving to go where? Now here. Uh yeah,
[1:01:23] I'm going to be going back to uh
[1:01:25] Thailand. I'm supposed to be leaving uh
[1:01:29] next weekend and uh I work uh in the
[1:01:33] Esan Providence
[1:01:35] and uh I'll be going to about six six
[1:01:39] seven different villages
[1:01:42] and uh I have uh some very close friends
[1:01:46] that are in Serpentin which is on the
[1:01:50] Cambodian and Thai border there. and uh
[1:01:56] I'd like to get down there and see him.
[1:01:59] So, uh I got to see what the situation
[1:02:02] is. I never worry when I go over there
[1:02:06] because God's always with me, you know,
[1:02:09] in the good times, in the bad times, you
[1:02:12] know. I'm not going to say every time I
[1:02:14] go there, you know, I got victories. a
[1:02:17] lot of times they come back, you know,
[1:02:21] and you don't have victories, but you
[1:02:24] keep praying.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; And uh I know God someday I've been
[1:02:30] praying. I've been going to Thailand for
[1:02:32] about well this year will be 48 years.
[1:02:37] And uh I'm praying that uh brother Ron
[1:02:42] went with his wife and I I know God's
[1:02:46] going to get this message in there, you
[1:02:49] know, and uh they I support and help the
[1:02:54] ones with the light that they're in, you
[1:02:57] know, and we are very fortunate. You
[1:03:00] can't imagine what we know, but they
[1:03:05] take the little lights they have because
[1:03:07] a lot of times when they accept Christ,
[1:03:10] they're thrown out because Buddhism is
[1:03:12] very strong in Thailand. Very strong.
[1:03:16] And it starts when they're young all the
[1:03:18] way up to the schools. So, yep. I just
[1:03:21] keep moving on, thanking the Lord.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Steve, what do you do in going
[1:03:26] over there? Do you have a job function
[1:03:28] that you actually
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Well, I I do quite a few things. Uh I
[1:03:32] work with different people. Uh I try to
[1:03:35] help some of the churches and witness
[1:03:37] over there. And then also because I'm a
[1:03:40] teacher, English teacher. I do go in try
[1:03:44] to go in the schools and I teach
[1:03:46] English.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; And work and uh that's what I do.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you're also a witness for him
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; all the time.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Ambassador of Christ. Yes. All the time.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; I want to pray over you right now.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Well, thank you, brother.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,

[1:04:05] testimony. You know he is a witness for
[1:04:08] you.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; We're asking you to watch over him. Be
[1:04:11] with him. Father, let him be a light in
[1:04:13] a dark and dying world. Let him be a
[1:04:15] witness of Christ of this hour. I pray
[1:04:18] that you will bless him his his time
[1:04:22] over there with the people and I pray
[1:04:24] that he would be a great witness to
[1:04:27] those into these remote villages places
[1:04:30] where many times people do not go but he
[1:04:32] goes. Father be with him and watch over
[1:04:35] him and keep him I pray in Jesus

[1:04:49] Malachi, help him down.
[1:04:56] Amen.
[1:05:00] Amen. Now,
[1:05:02] today is going to be a little bit
[1:05:04] different.
[1:05:06] Um, today is going to be my quote
[1:05:10] Christmas message, but I'm not much into
[1:05:13] Christmas because Christmas, according
[1:05:15] to history, is a pagan holiday.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; How many know that?
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon preaches a sermon,
[1:05:24] Christianity versus Idolatry.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Okay. And uh, so what I'm going to be
[1:05:31] speaking on today may be in a different
[1:05:34] direction.
[1:05:36] Uh, but I want you all to listen because
[1:05:38] I believe that God's got a word for you
[1:05:41] today.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh, so I'd like you all to
[1:05:46] stand. Let's sing. Only believe. Only
[1:05:49] believe.
[1:05:51] Yes. Only
[1:05:54] believe.
[1:05:58] Only
[1:06:00] believe.
[1:06:04] All things are possible.
[1:06:10] Only
[1:06:12] believe.
[1:06:15] Only
[1:06:17] believe.
[1:06:21] Only
[1:06:23] believe.
[1:06:26] All things are possible.
[1:06:32] All
[1:06:37] God bless you. You can be seated for
[1:06:38] just a moment. We have here brother
[1:06:42] Isaiah Brooks. Brother Isaiah, you came
[1:06:46] to be a part of this wedding yesterday.
[1:06:48] The bridegroom is going to be going to
[1:06:51] your church.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we want you to come up here
[1:06:56] and bless the Had I known you as coming.
[1:07:00] I'd be sitting down over here.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; But God saw fit for you to come. Would
[1:07:05] you come up here? You've been a blessing
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; to many of the people around the world.
[1:07:10] He's quite a singer. He asked, he said,
[1:07:11] "Brother Ron, do you mind if I bring my
[1:07:13] tambourine?" He said, "No, play it. Let
[1:07:15] you know." And uh I remember over in um
[1:07:20] we were in Israel together. We made a
[1:07:22] tour of Israel and I believe we were in
[1:07:24] the city of Cesaria
[1:07:27] and there they had an amphitheater,
[1:07:30] an old Roman amphitheater
[1:07:36] and we had just all gathered and we were
[1:07:39] up in the amphitheater and were walking
[1:07:41] around. This is a historical place and
[1:07:45] there's a stage up there
[1:07:49] and uh we were just kind of taking in
[1:07:52] and taking photos and we're looking in
[1:07:55] at this historical place and then uh
[1:07:59] brother Isaiah came out onto the stage
[1:08:04] and this is a natural amphitheater and
[1:08:07] it echoes
[1:08:09] why he has a voice that doesn't even
[1:08:12] need an amplification system.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; But all of a sudden you you hear and in
[1:08:19] this corner,
[1:08:24] a mighty champion,
[1:08:27] and he begins to sing. And I'll tell
[1:08:29] you, the presence of God came down.
[1:08:31] Brother Isaiah, we welcome you. I don't
[1:08:33] know what you're going to sing, but you
[1:08:35] are welcome here. And I forgive you for
[1:08:37] not letting me know you were here
[1:08:40] because I would have had you to preach.
[1:08:42] But God bless you, brother Isaiah. Bless
[1:08:44] our people now in song.
[1:09:01] For years, we've tried to get by this
[1:09:03] church and we finally came.
[1:09:08] Um,
[1:09:09] the strangest thing is I thought Brother
[1:09:11] Ron knew I was coming. I was told that,
[1:09:15] but by the grace of God, I'm here.
[1:09:19] And um
[1:09:21] I remember that time in Israel
[1:09:25] and what a wonderful time that we did
[1:09:28] have.
[1:09:30] But I just want to greet you from Higher
[1:09:32] Ground Tabernacle there in
[1:09:36] De Moine, Iowa. I know some other people
[1:09:38] that attend my churches here somewhere.
[1:09:42] But uh it's been a blessing to it is a
[1:09:45] blessing uh to be here and to to be a
[1:09:48] blessing to you. May May God help me.
[1:09:54] I love you, Lord.
[1:09:59] For your mercy never fails me.
[1:10:05] All of my life
[1:10:08] I've been held in your hand.
[1:10:14] From the moment that I wake up
[1:10:19] until I lay my head.
[1:10:23] Oh, I will sing
[1:10:26] of the goodness
[1:10:28] of God.
[1:10:33] Yes. All my life you have been faithful.
[1:10:41] Oh,
[1:10:43] how many life you have been so
[1:10:48] oh good
[1:10:51] with every breath that I am able.
[1:10:57] Oh, I will sing. Woo! Of the goodness
[1:11:03] of God.
[1:11:06] I love your voice.
[1:11:12] You have led me through the fire
[1:11:17] in all my name.
[1:11:20] There's none like no other.
[1:11:26] I know you as a father.
[1:11:30] I know you as a friend.
[1:11:34] And I have lived
[1:11:37] in the good days of God.
[1:11:44] Yes. All my life you have been faithful.
[1:11:52] Oh,
[1:11:54] all my life you have been so so good
[1:12:02] with every breath that I am able.
[1:12:08] Oh, I will sing
[1:12:11] of the goodness
[1:12:13] of God. I love your voice. I love your
[1:12:17] voice.
[1:12:21] You have led me through the fire
[1:12:26] in the darkest night. You are close like
[1:12:31] no other.
[1:12:35] I know you as a father.
[1:12:39] You have been my best friend
[1:12:43] and I have lived
[1:12:46] in the goodness
[1:12:48] of God.
[1:12:52] Yes.
[1:12:54] All my life you have been faithful.
[1:13:00] Oh,
[1:13:02] how my life you have is so so good.
[1:13:10] But everyone
[1:13:15] help me sing it. Oh, I will sing
[1:13:19] in the goodness
[1:13:21] of God.
[1:13:26] Your goodness is running after
[1:13:30] running after me.
[1:13:35] Your goodness is running after
[1:13:38] running in
[1:13:41] with my life laid down. I surrender now.
[1:13:46] I give you everything.
[1:13:51] Your goodness is turning in.
[1:13:54] ground you for me.
[1:13:59] In all my life, you have been faithful.
[1:14:07] In all my life, you have been so so good
[1:14:15] with every breath that I am. Hallelujah.
[1:14:20] Oh Lord, I have seen
[1:14:24] of the goodness
[1:14:26] of God.
[1:14:29] Oh, I will sing
[1:14:32] of the goodness
[1:14:35] of God.
[1:14:38] Yes, I will sing
[1:14:41] of the goodness
[1:14:44] of God.
[1:14:54] How many enjoyed that?
[1:14:56] I'd like a double portion.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; I want another song.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask you right now.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Another song. Whatever you feel on your
[1:15:08] heart.

[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:39] I'd like to introduce
[1:15:43] to you.

[1:15:52] of the good

[1:17:15] He left his hometown
[1:17:19] to enter this arena
[1:17:23] to raise his hand in victory
[1:17:26] for you and me. But you see, there was
[1:17:31] an angry crowd that cried, "Crucify him.
[1:17:35] He
[1:17:37] who wore their crown."
[1:17:40] and they watch my champion go down.
[1:17:47] But I will never count him out cuz I'm a
[1:17:53] wind
[1:17:56] that day.
[1:17:58] He rose to procla
[1:18:10] singing now. Oh, he's greater.

[1:18:24] He's so mighty.
[1:18:26] the mightiest

[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together, please. Thank you,
[1:20:07] musicians.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to turn with me if you
[1:20:13] would into the book of Matthew, chapter
[1:20:16] 24.
[1:20:23] certainly enjoyed all of the song
[1:20:25] specials.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; I greet all of our visitors today,
[1:20:37] different ones that have come for the
[1:20:38] wedding
[1:20:40] and some have come back home just to be
[1:20:43] with us for a day or two. Brother Creed
[1:20:46] and Sister Abigail, their family.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Where is Creed? Did he step out a
[1:20:52] minute? Ah, I tell you that's okay. I'm
[1:20:56] glad he slipped in.
[1:20:59] He slipped out for a moment. But we love
[1:21:01] Brother Creed. I remember back when we
[1:21:03] had a prayer meeting at our church on
[1:21:05] Maryland
[1:21:06] Wednesday night. Do you remember that?
[1:21:08] You wrote it down. a little overhead
[1:21:10] projector and says, "Is there anyone
[1:21:12] here that has a prayer request?" Yes,
[1:21:16] Abigail. Yes, brother. Oh, yes, Amy.
[1:21:19] Well, I've got a friend of mine and I'd
[1:21:22] like you to pray for him. His name is
[1:21:24] Creed. I said, "What?" Yeah, his name is
[1:21:26] Creed.
[1:21:29] After we came to know him, I said, "He's
[1:21:31] the only Creed I'm going to allow in the
[1:21:33] church."
[1:21:36] Anyway, we're so pleased to have you,
[1:21:38] Sister Abby.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Matthew chapter 24.
[1:21:48] I'm a little
[1:21:51] shook up this morning.
[1:21:57] He's been dealing with me since last
[1:21:59] night.
[1:22:01] And this morning
[1:22:03] it just started coming like a
[1:22:06] fire hydrant.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Actually, I
[1:22:13] I had to tell him,
[1:22:16] "Slow down.
[1:22:19] I can't go that fast."
[1:22:23] Matthew chapter 24 verse 43.
[1:22:29] Actually, I'll back up to 42 for to get
[1:22:32] a more complete text. Watch therefore,
[1:22:36] for you know not what hour your Lord
[1:22:39] does come.
[1:22:41] But know this, that the goodman of the
[1:22:43] house,
[1:22:46] if he'd have known what watch the thief
[1:22:49] would come,
[1:22:51] he would have watched and he would have
[1:22:54] not suffered his house to be broken up.
[1:22:59] Therefore, be ye also ready,
[1:23:03] for in such an hour as you think not,
[1:23:06] the Son of Man cometh.
[1:23:11] Who then is a faithful and wise servant,
[1:23:14] whom his Lord hath made ruler
[1:23:18] of his own household, to give them meat
[1:23:22] in due season.
[1:23:25] Blessed is he. Blessed is that servant
[1:23:29] whom his lord when he cometh shall find
[1:23:32] so doing.
[1:23:34] Verily I say unto you that he shall make
[1:23:38] him ruler over all his goods. Turn with
[1:23:43] me if you would to the book of St. Luke
[1:23:45] chapter 2. Luke chapter 2
[1:23:51] verses 1-5.
[1:23:58] So, I wish
[1:24:01] for just a moment this morning. I'm not
[1:24:03] going to keep you very long.
[1:24:07] I I told Brother Robert I only got,
[1:24:12] you know, page and a half of notes. He
[1:24:14] said, "Well, that's an hour and a half
[1:24:16] right there.
[1:24:24] Luke chapter 2
[1:24:27] verse 1-15. And it came to pass in those
[1:24:30] days
[1:24:31] that there went out a decree from Caesar
[1:24:34] Augustus that all the world should be
[1:24:36] taxed.
[1:24:38] This taxing was first made when Sirenius
[1:24:41] was governor of Syria.
[1:24:45] And all went to be taxed, everyone into
[1:24:48] his own city.
[1:24:50] And Joseph also went up from Galilee out
[1:24:52] of the city of Nazareth into Judea
[1:24:56] under the city of David,
[1:24:58] which is called Bethlehem,
[1:25:02] because he was of the house and lineage
[1:25:05] of David,
[1:25:09] to be taxed with Mary, his espouseed
[1:25:11] wife, being great with child.
[1:25:16] And so it was that while they were
[1:25:18] there, the days were accomplished
[1:25:22] that she should be delivered.
[1:25:29] And she brought forth her firstborn son
[1:25:33] and wrapped him in swaddling clothes
[1:25:37] and laid him in a manger
[1:25:40] because there was no room for them
[1:25:44] in the end.
[1:25:47] And there was and there were in the same
[1:25:50] country shepherds abiding in the field,
[1:25:53] keeping watch over their flocks by
[1:25:55] night.
[1:25:57] And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon
[1:25:59] them, and the glory of the Lord shone
[1:26:02] round about them, they were so afraid.
[1:26:05] And the angel said unto them, "Fear not,
[1:26:08] for behold, I bring you good tidings of
[1:26:12] great joy,
[1:26:14] which shall be to all people.
[1:26:17] For unto you is born this day the city
[1:26:19] of David a Savior, which is Christ the
[1:26:22] Lord.
[1:26:24] And this shall be a sign unto you.
[1:26:28] You shall find the babe wrapped in
[1:26:30] swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.
[1:26:34] And suddenly there was with the angel a
[1:26:37] multitude of the heavenly hosts praising
[1:26:40] God and saying, "Glory to God in the
[1:26:44] highest,
[1:26:46] and on earth peace,
[1:26:48] good will toward all men.
[1:26:53] And it came to pass as the angels were
[1:26:56] gone away from them into heaven,
[1:26:59] the shepherds said one to another,
[1:27:03] "Let us go now even unto Bethlehem,
[1:27:07] and see this thing which is come to
[1:27:09] pass,
[1:27:11] which the Lord hath made known
[1:27:14] unto us." May God bless the reading of
[1:27:17] his word, and you all may be seated this
[1:27:19] morning in the presence of the Lord.
[1:27:23] Now, I'm titling this because I'm not
[1:27:26] finished with
[1:27:29] this little thought that I had, but I'm
[1:27:31] going to go in another direction. So,
[1:27:34] just kind of bear with me this morning,
[1:27:36] but I titled this uniting time and sign
[1:27:40] part two.
[1:27:46] And I would like to title my sermon
[1:27:51] or take the subject of this title
[1:27:55] and I would like to declare God's gift
[1:28:00] to himself.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; You see, 2,000 years ago, God gave a
[1:28:10] gift to the world.
[1:28:18] 2,000 years later,
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; God gave a gift to himself.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to be spiritual and I
[1:28:28] want you to follow along. Now,
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; so
[1:28:37] this will not be a normal Christmas
[1:28:39] message
[1:28:42] because we know as Christians that this
[1:28:44] really is a pagan holiday. And for some
[1:28:48] of you that have not been here and seen
[1:28:50] the the teachings that we've brought out
[1:28:53] through the message and the word of God
[1:28:55] and everything and that we know that
[1:28:57] Christ was not born on December 25th.
[1:28:59] It's that goes all the way back to
[1:29:01] ancient Babylon.
[1:29:04] And so
[1:29:07] we see that the devil is trying to bring
[1:29:10] back another Babylonian worship by
[1:29:14] taking away
[1:29:16] from the birth of Christ. One thing I
[1:29:18] enjoy about Christmas is at least at
[1:29:21] least it makes the world stand up and
[1:29:24] pay attention for a moment.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; That there was a child born. Yeah.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; And this one had such an effect he split
[1:29:37] time in half.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; BC and AD.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; I'd say that's a pretty profound
[1:29:43] character that would come in that every
[1:29:46] time you sign a check, every time you
[1:29:49] put a date on something, you are talking
[1:29:51] about from the time of his birth.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; What an effect
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; this Christ child had.
[1:30:05] Now friends, I'd like to take a few
[1:30:07] moments
[1:30:08] this morning to parallel the first
[1:30:10] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to his
[1:30:14] second coming.
[1:30:18] Because we know that just as the world
[1:30:21] missed him
[1:30:23] because of misconstrued
[1:30:25] ideas in theology,
[1:30:28] they missed him. They were looking for a
[1:30:31] king and God sent him a baby.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; See, God interprets his word how he
[1:30:38] wants to.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Regardless of how we figure it out, how
[1:30:42] the theologians figure it out or the
[1:30:44] religious people, God brings his word to
[1:30:47] pass.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says God is his own
[1:30:50] interpreter. Amen.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; God will always bypass man's
[1:30:58] interpretations
[1:31:00] of how Christ would come and fulfill the
[1:31:03] prophecy.
[1:31:07] So I want to launch off now into another
[1:31:10] portion of scripture found in Hebrews
[1:31:12] chap 10. Hebrews 10:es 1-9.
[1:31:18] So now watch this because things are
[1:31:20] types and shadows. Brother Brennham
[1:31:22] said, "I'm a typologist."
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "Watch what happened back then
[1:31:28] and you will see what will happen now
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; because history repeats itself. As it
[1:31:34] was, so shall it be."
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; All right. Hebrews 10:es 1-9.
[1:31:41] For the law having a shadow of good
[1:31:43] things to come,
[1:31:45] and not the very image of the things,
[1:31:49] can never with those sacrifices which
[1:31:51] they offered
[1:31:53] year by year continually make the comers
[1:31:56] there unto perfect.
[1:32:00] For then
[1:32:02] would they have not ceased to be offered
[1:32:07] because that the worshippers once purged
[1:32:09] should have no more conscience of sins.
[1:32:14] But in those sacrifices
[1:32:17] there is a remembrance again made of
[1:32:20] sins every year.
[1:32:23] For it is not possible that the blood of
[1:32:25] bulls and goats should take away sin.
[1:32:29] Wherefore when he cometh into the world,
[1:32:32] he saith, sacrifice and offering thou
[1:32:35] wouldest not, but a body hast thou
[1:32:38] prepared for me.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Notice this.
[1:32:43] He's not interested in sacrifice and
[1:32:45] offering,
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; but he's going now to a body
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; in burnt offerings and sacrifices for
[1:32:56] sin. Thou hast
[1:32:58] had no pleasure.
[1:33:02] Then said I, Lo, I come
[1:33:05] in the volume of the book,
[1:33:08] it is written of me
[1:33:12] to do thy will, oh God.
[1:33:15] Above when he said, "Sacrifice and
[1:33:18] offering and burnt offerings and
[1:33:20] offering for sin, thou wouldest not.
[1:33:25] Neither had his pleasure therein, which
[1:33:27] is offered by the way, excuse me, by the
[1:33:30] law.
[1:33:32] Then said he, "Lo, I come to do the will
[1:33:36] of God.
[1:33:39] He taketh away the first that he may
[1:33:43] establish the second."
[1:33:47] So, I kind of feel compelled to preach
[1:33:49] this this morning.
[1:33:52] I want to put you in remembrance of
[1:33:54] those things that came to pass in the
[1:33:57] first advent or the first coming of
[1:33:59] Christ.
[1:34:02] Just as it was in the first Christmas,
[1:34:06] if we call it that, the coming of
[1:34:09] Christ,
[1:34:11] the word was being made flesh
[1:34:14] in a Christ child.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; So this event must take place again
[1:34:20] today.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "I show you a mystery."
[1:34:27] talking about a husband and wife and a
[1:34:29] marriage and the two became one flesh.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; There is uniting taking place.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand that the
[1:34:36] word has got to be here
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; in some kind of form for you to be
[1:34:42] united with it.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; And as I told you before, he's not
[1:34:48] taking
[1:34:49] a forgiven woman. And he's taking a
[1:34:52] woman that is justified, meaning she
[1:34:55] never did it in the first place.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:05] So this union
[1:35:09] is a sign
[1:35:13] and it also is a declaration of the
[1:35:16] time.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; For God will bring his word to pass in
[1:35:20] its season.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Understand, we've got to know the season
[1:35:25] in the hour in which we're born.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why God sends a prophet
[1:35:30] because a prophet becomes the mouthpiece
[1:35:32] of God and he takes you back to the
[1:35:34] scripture. It's written
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; and he begins to take modern events and
[1:35:38] MAKES THEM CLEAR BY THE PROPHECY OF THE
[1:35:41] WORD. AMEN.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; So we see that
[1:35:53] the same thing that took place back then
[1:35:56] is taking place again today but in a
[1:35:58] mystery form.
[1:36:01] Now the brother Brennham said the
[1:36:03] greatest thing that God could give a man
[1:36:07] outside of salvation is what?
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; A wife.
[1:36:15] Think of this.
[1:36:17] So God
[1:36:20] gave himself,
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; a wife,
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; she will be
[1:36:29] bone of his bone,
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; flesh of his flesh,
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; she will be him.
[1:36:39] And the voice that was in
[1:36:43] the star messenger.
[1:36:45] You see my brother, my sister,
[1:36:47] understand
[1:36:49] the voice did not stop
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; when Malachi 4 went off to sing.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:57] In fact, I tell you, Revelations 10:7,
[1:37:00] when he shall begin to sound,
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; I say there's still a sounding.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; It's not just on a tape,
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; but it's in a corporal body
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; because that anointed word has taken on
[1:37:20] flesh.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Are are you following with me?
[1:37:32] So, how shall these things come to pass
[1:37:35] seeing that I know not a man?
[1:37:40] This is exactly what regardless of how
[1:37:43] much supernatural and vindications and
[1:37:45] signs and wonders and angels and and
[1:37:48] shepherds coming and all this stuff,
[1:37:50] Mary was saying unto herself, well, how
[1:37:54] can this come to pass? Seeing I know not
[1:37:56] a man. I want you to understand that
[1:37:59] this message is not the message of
[1:38:03] William Brennham.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; He was only the voice.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; He was only the vocal cord.
[1:38:09] Do you understand that?
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; But there was a voice behind the veil.
[1:38:14] We saw the veil.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; But there was a voice behind it.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; There was a picture within the picture.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; So how shall these things come to pass,
[1:38:30] seeing I know not a man?
[1:38:33] Because
[1:38:35] Mary was saying, "Okay,
[1:38:38] what does all of this mean? How are you
[1:38:40] going to bring this to pass?
[1:38:43] Because I've not known a man yet."
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; This angel said, "Not many days hence."
[1:38:53] And the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you,
[1:38:56] and you shall conceive,
[1:38:59] and you shall bring forth a child, and
[1:39:00] you shall name him Jesus.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Are you Are you following this thought
[1:39:06] now?
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Angel,
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; chosen vessel.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; She's trying to comprehend
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; just like all of us are trying to
[1:39:17] comprehend. What is this message all
[1:39:20] about? What is it to do? It's to not
[1:39:22] just tell you how to go to church.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Random says, "I'm here to tell
[1:39:26] you how that you might be the powerhouse
[1:39:28] of the living God."
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, what house were you
[1:39:35] building?
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; What temple is he coming to? That's
[1:39:41] right.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Just as there was a virgin woman chosen
[1:39:50] of God to receive that anointed word
[1:39:53] that the angel messenger had spoken. So
[1:39:56] again, there's been a word
[1:40:00] that has come through a star messenger.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; We have seen his star in the east. Amen.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; And that's a reason we come together
[1:40:09] this morning that we might worship him
[1:40:11] because they that worship him must
[1:40:13] worship him in spirit and in truth.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Wise men still seek him.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:26] So again, the word will become quick and
[1:40:30] made alive by the work of the Holy
[1:40:32] Spirit to BRING FORTH A CHRIST child in
[1:40:36] this hour
[1:40:38] because he said the Holy Ghost shall
[1:40:40] overshadow you
[1:40:43] and you shall conceive. So this
[1:40:45] overshadowing
[1:40:48] that is taking place
[1:40:51] has within it the power to conceive
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; to as many as would receive him. To them
[1:40:58] gave he the power
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; to become the sons of God to conceive
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; because in non seed they can hear the
[1:41:09] same word and it brings no conception.
[1:41:12] That's right.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; He said nonseed
[1:41:16] cannot be quickened.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, they feel anointings.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "But there's nothing to quicken
[1:41:24] the seed inside because there's no seed
[1:41:27] there to be quickened."
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; And that's the difference between us and
[1:41:32] them
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; because you have got a predestinated
[1:41:36] seed inside OF YOU. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
[1:41:38] HERE. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT OUT THERE.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT SITTING THERE AND
[1:41:43] KEEPING CHRIST 2,000 YEARS AGO. THE
[1:41:46] DEVIL IS NOT AFRAID OF A GOD OF HISTORY.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; You can keep him in a manger. You can
[1:41:53] sing Noel. You can sing oh Bethlehem and
[1:41:56] all of the songs and you can have a
[1:41:58] Christmas pageant. And you can have
[1:42:00] shepherds and sheep and camels and wise
[1:42:03] men AND YOU CAN COME.
[1:42:07] BUT THAT'S JUST A GOD OF HISTORY.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; I want to BRING A GOD OUT OF HISTORY TO
[1:42:12] A GOD WHO'S CONTEMPORARY, WHO'S THE SAME
[1:42:16] YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; This conception
[1:42:28] is the overshadowing
[1:42:30] by the Holy Spirit himself.
[1:42:34] It is without the instrumentation of
[1:42:36] man.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Mary said, "How will this be, seeing
[1:42:40] I've not known a man?"
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Because this conception
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; because that which is born of the flesh,
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; it's flesh.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; But that which is born of the spirit is
[1:42:52] spirit.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; It will not be the intellectual
[1:42:56] interpretation of some theologian.
[1:43:00] It will not come through carnal
[1:43:01] understanding, but it is actually an act
[1:43:04] of the Holy Ghost which will bring forth
[1:43:08] an immaculate
[1:43:10] conception.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham actually said the new
[1:43:17] birth
[1:43:18] is actually
[1:43:21] he says of greater understanding
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; than of natural birth.
[1:43:31] There's something that happens
[1:43:34] when there is a uniting taking place.
[1:43:37] Now we're talking now be spiritual and
[1:43:39] understand when a husband and wife have
[1:43:42] been united together
[1:43:45] and in the act of love she may be
[1:43:47] carrying the o
[1:43:52] but he carries the germ of life
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; and the female
[1:43:59] without the life from the male
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; cannot conceive. Amen.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; In fact, every one of you women
[1:44:11] from the time that you have come to the
[1:44:15] place
[1:44:17] physically and of age
[1:44:21] you start becoming a woman.
[1:44:26] And it shows in a cycle of life.
[1:44:31] And every month if you do not have the
[1:44:34] seed fertilized,
[1:44:36] it goes through a cycle.
[1:44:41] And if that seed is not germatized, it
[1:44:43] is passed out of the body.
[1:44:47] But now
[1:44:48] when
[1:44:51] she has this germ of life come from the
[1:44:54] man, now remember every seed was must
[1:44:58] bring forth of its own kind.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the carrier of life is in the
[1:45:04] mail.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; She has the oam.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; She's the incubator.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; AND WHATEVER SEED SHE TAKES INTO HER
[1:45:13] MIND, INTO THE WOMB.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; If it conceives, IT'LL BRING FORTH
[1:45:19] EITHER OF GOOD OR OF BAD.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU ALLOW INTO YOUR MIND
[1:45:24] BECAUSE YOUR MIND IS THE WOMB TO YOUR
[1:45:26] SPIRIT. YOU FEED IT ON THE THINGS OF THE
[1:45:29] WORLD, YOU BECOME THE WORLD.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU FEED IT ON THE WORD, YOU
[1:45:33] BECOME THE WORD.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Guard your mind.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; It will be a greater conception.
[1:45:51] It'll be without human desire.
[1:45:57] WITHOUT ANY KIND OF HUMAN intervention
[1:46:00] whatsoever,
[1:46:02] without man trying to bring the word to
[1:46:04] pass through carnal understanding.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; God doesn't need your help.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; 2,000 years ago, it was the first coming
[1:46:18] of Christ.
[1:46:20] Here we are again in a setting of
[1:46:22] prophetic history.
[1:46:26] Back then it was the coming of the
[1:46:28] prophetic spoken word birthed by a
[1:46:30] virgin.
[1:46:32] And many of them missed him fulfilling
[1:46:35] the prophecy by listening to false
[1:46:37] interpretation of religious ministries.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; It was a revealing of the son of man
[1:46:45] ministry veiled in human flesh of Jesus
[1:46:49] Christ.
[1:46:51] They missed it because of the veil.
[1:46:53] Because it came contrary to their
[1:46:55] understanding.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; God doesn't need your help.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "Lean not to your own
[1:47:03] understanding."
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, what house will you
[1:47:11] build in?
[1:47:16] What kind of dwelling place will the
[1:47:19] prophetic word make himself known in?
[1:47:24] Satan's not afraid, as I said, of some
[1:47:27] historical god.
[1:47:30] A god of 2,000 years ago. You can sing
[1:47:33] all the songs. You can get religious.
[1:47:35] You can say all of those things and do
[1:47:38] all of those things and make the the
[1:47:41] pageantry of the birth of Christ. And
[1:47:44] churches are more filled on two holidays
[1:47:48] here in America more than any other.
[1:47:50] Christmas and Easter.
[1:47:53] And both of them are pagan.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with this picture?
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; But every Sunday we celebrate
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; the resurrection in Christ.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Because God has given us a new day.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:12] So,
[1:48:14] Satan's not afraid of a historical God.
[1:48:20] He just wants you to live in the glare
[1:48:23] of yesterday.
[1:48:25] Not in the light of what God is doing
[1:48:27] today.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; See, I as a minister don't want to just
[1:48:32] point you back to what God has done.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Nor do I want to tell you about what God
[1:48:38] will do.
[1:48:40] Because so much of the time you can see
[1:48:42] what God has done and you understand
[1:48:45] MAYBE WHAT GOD WILL DO, BUT YOU'RE
[1:48:47] MISSING WHAT GOD IS DOING.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; FOR JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY,
[1:48:53] TODAY, AND FOREVER. WHY DID GOD SEND A
[1:48:56] PROPHET?
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; What is this MESSAGE ALL ABOUT? HAS it
[1:49:01] had an effect upon you?
[1:49:09] Just as Herod, understand this now, as
[1:49:12] Herod who is just a figurehead
[1:49:16] of the ruling governmental powers of
[1:49:18] that day, Herod made a declaration, kill
[1:49:21] every manchild from two years of age,
[1:49:25] trying to stop
[1:49:27] the manifestation
[1:49:29] of this Christ child.
[1:49:35] Not only did the government seek to kill
[1:49:37] the effect, but there was also the
[1:49:39] religious ones, the Pharisees and
[1:49:41] Sadducees that rose up.
[1:49:44] Do you see the civil and ecclesiastical
[1:49:47] powers? Do you understand what's
[1:49:49] happening in America today? Revelation
[1:49:52] chapter 13, rising up like a buffalo.
[1:49:55] Huh?
[1:49:57] And he says, "But she will end by
[1:50:00] speaking like a dragon."
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, my brother, my sister,
[1:50:04] no matter how much we try to put ones in
[1:50:09] office for authority to bring America
[1:50:12] back, she's done. She's history. She's
[1:50:15] over.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; So, we're not looking for that.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; We are not looking We're Hey, listen.
[1:50:25] We're not
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; MAGA.
[1:50:29] make America great again.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, THIS KINGDOM IS GOING
[1:50:33] DOWN.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; SHE REJECTED CHRIST, THE WORD.
[1:50:37] THEREFORE, she's being REJECTED
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; AND SHE WILL suffer
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; and she's going TO BE JUDGED. BUT
[1:50:45] THERE'S ANOTHER JUDGMENT GOING ON right
[1:50:47] now. IT'S CALLED THE BRIDE OF CHRIST AND
[1:50:50] IT'S THE ONLY JUDGMENT SHE'S GOING TO RE
[1:50:52] RECEIVE. AND THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW
[1:50:54] BECAUSE JUDGMENT BEGINS at the house of
[1:50:57] God.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; We don't come here to see how good we
[1:51:00] are. We come here to see where
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; what we do wrong.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:11] Lord help me
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; this morning to bring a thought to the
[1:51:16] people.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; So there there was also a governmental
[1:51:20] system and a religious system Pharisees
[1:51:23] and Sadducees
[1:51:25] type of the clergy that they found fault
[1:51:28] with
[1:51:30] he who had the message of the hour.
[1:51:33] Every time that CHRIST WOULD SPEAK, THEY
[1:51:37] SAW IT. Find fault with what he was
[1:51:39] teaching.
[1:51:41] Oh, it's no different today than what it
[1:51:44] was then.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; No wonder there. Well, he said this
[1:51:47] wrong, said that wrong. Uh h how many I
[1:51:50] want to ask you a question.
[1:51:52] When Jesus fed 5,000, how do you know it
[1:51:55] was 5,000 exactly?
[1:51:58] Were any of you there? Did they take a
[1:52:01] headcount?
[1:52:03] that they count and say, "Let me see.
[1:52:04] Okay, one, two, three, four. Hey, you
[1:52:06] you disciples, go out there and count,
[1:52:08] everybody. Bring it back together. Let's
[1:52:09] put it on our computer and find out.
[1:52:12] Yeah, exactly 5,000."
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Listen, it doesn't matter the number.
[1:52:19] So many people try to find problems
[1:52:22] within this message with something so
[1:52:25] weak as
[1:52:27] a number.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Who cares?
[1:52:34] But you see, they found fault with
[1:52:36] Christ in that day.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; And they're going to find fault with the
[1:52:41] Christ of this hour.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Do you understand
[1:52:45] what is Christ? Christ is an anointing.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; That's why
[1:52:50] when
[1:52:53] some of the disciples came to their
[1:52:55] brothers and said, "Hey, come. We have
[1:52:56] found the Christ of this hour."
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Whoa.
[1:53:03] Where'd he come from?
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Well, he comes from Bethlehem. Can any
[1:53:09] good thing come out of Bethlehem?
[1:53:14] They find fault
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; with wherever
[1:53:18] they can.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; They want to show you, hey,
[1:53:23] don't listen to this man.
[1:53:28] So they brought an indictment
[1:53:33] against Christ in that hour and they
[1:53:36] crucified him.
[1:53:41] So I want you to understand
[1:53:43] that there's been an indictment reached
[1:53:45] in this hour
[1:53:48] and there's been a prophet who said I
[1:53:51] indict this second generation.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. this generation for the
[1:53:57] second crucifixion of Christ the word.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; They're doing it everywhere.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Trying to take away from the anointed
[1:54:04] word of the hour.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what the devil wants to
[1:54:08] do.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Okay? He wants to throw in his doubts
[1:54:13] and all of his misinterpretations and
[1:54:16] try to get you all confused. And then
[1:54:18] really, what is truth?
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what truth is. It's his
[1:54:23] word.
[1:54:25] Amen.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; But it's not just his word,
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; but it's the revelation of that word.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Revelation to you is more powerful than
[1:54:34] you can ever really realize.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Revelation when it comes and strikes
[1:54:39] that seed, it brings forth a life out of
[1:54:42] that seed and brings it into A
[1:54:45] MANIFESTATION. YOU TELL ME that you
[1:54:47] believe this message of the hour. LET ME
[1:54:49] SEE THE MANIFESTATION
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; OF THAT PROPHET'S MESSAGE WHICH IS the
[1:54:56] word for this hour. Let me see it in
[1:54:58] your life.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Because a tree
[1:55:04] is known by its fruit.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Show me the fruits of the message in
[1:55:10] your life.
[1:55:14] Brother Brenham says in the indictment,
[1:55:16] there it is. The sign of the time,
[1:55:21] WHAT DID THEY CLASS HIM? A fanatic, a
[1:55:23] crazy man. Yeah. They found fault with
[1:55:26] the man who was the word. He was the
[1:55:29] word. St. John the first chapter proves
[1:55:32] it. In the beginning was the word and
[1:55:34] the word was with God and the word was
[1:55:36] made flesh and dwelt among us. He was
[1:55:39] the living word of God because he was
[1:55:41] expressing God through himself.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; He was so completely surrendered to the
[1:55:47] word of God till he and the word was the
[1:55:50] same.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what the church ought
[1:55:56] to be today.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; So he's typing what Christ was then is
[1:56:01] what the church ought to be today.
[1:56:04] That's exactly what the church ought to
[1:56:06] be today. And the word of God is the
[1:56:08] same.
[1:56:11] How can you be a part of the word
[1:56:14] when you deny practically all of it?
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; And the reason it's done is because the
[1:56:20] people, that's the reason I think God
[1:56:22] spoke to me about calling his people
[1:56:25] Ricky's and Rkettas. How many know
[1:56:28] brother Brandon was rebuked of the angel
[1:56:30] said because he kept saying Rickys and
[1:56:32] Retas,
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:56:34] Now, I thank God that God corrected him
[1:56:37] because I was one of them.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; You can't judge a book by its cover.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "I've got seed out there that
[1:56:50] look like a Ricky, but he's not a Ricky.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; They look like rakettas, but they're not
[1:56:54] raketas.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Just wait until the word has an effect
[1:56:57] and the revelation they'll come out of
[1:56:59] that.
[1:57:04] And because of these selfish
[1:57:06] denominations has got those people
[1:57:07] living out there in the way they're
[1:57:09] living. They've crucified the truth and
[1:57:13] people call it a blasphemy and made it
[1:57:17] blasphemy rather. They call it a
[1:57:19] fanaticism and so forth and not knowing
[1:57:22] that they're blaspheming the very god
[1:57:25] that they go to church to serve.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Therefore, I indict the bunch of clergy
[1:57:29] today. I indict this generation in the
[1:57:32] name of Jesus Christ under the anointing
[1:57:34] of God's word. You are c crucifying him
[1:57:37] again.
[1:57:39] My
[1:57:40] as the word was crucified 2,000 years
[1:57:43] ago. The religious system had crucified
[1:57:46] the effects of the word so it could not
[1:57:49] come into their flesh.
[1:57:53] In God's, if I could say this, in God's
[1:57:57] first Christmas,
[1:58:01] he wrapped his gift
[1:58:07] in a paper that didn't look too nice to
[1:58:11] wrap such a great gift.
[1:58:14] Wrapped it in swaddling cloth.
[1:58:18] And he there was no room in the end.
[1:58:23] There was no royal bed for him to come
[1:58:25] to. They laid him in a manger.
[1:58:32] Why would they lay him in a manger?
[1:58:34] Because that's where lambs are born.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; So here they God sent him
[1:58:45] a prophetic word
[1:58:48] and he gave him a baby.
[1:58:51] You see, God can fulfill his word so
[1:58:54] contrary to our understanding.
[1:58:57] That's why, my brother, my sister, until
[1:59:00] we fully catch a grasp of this
[1:59:02] revelation,
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; all you'll do is make out of brother
[1:59:06] Brandham's message creeds and dogmas and
[1:59:09] laws.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; We don't want to do that.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; We want the life of God
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; inside us.
[1:59:21] It was a uniting time in sign in that
[1:59:23] day.
[1:59:26] And I say and declare unto all of you
[1:59:28] and listen to me carefully. There's
[1:59:30] another uniting time and sign going
[1:59:34] forth right now.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Don't miss it.
[1:59:40] 2,000 years ago, it was the bridegroom
[1:59:44] coming of Christ.
[1:59:48] Now, in this day,
[1:59:51] it's the bride coming of Christ
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; because God's got to bring
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Omega back to Alpha.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; See, uniting it back together. What's he
[2:00:04] doing?
[2:00:09] He's giving himself
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; a bride.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; What is she? bone of his bone and flesh
[2:00:18] of his flesh.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; So now
[2:00:25] it's a mystery in another form. Did you
[2:00:28] know you're a mystery?
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; You are the mystery
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; that is being unfolded in this very hour
[2:00:36] to know who you are, where you come
[2:00:38] from, and where you belong.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; So watch this.
[2:00:46] In is in the sermon it is the rising of
[2:00:49] the sun.
[2:00:51] Now the sermon
[2:00:53] title speaks volumes.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; There was a rising of another son. Don't
[2:00:58] think of just the physical son but a
[2:01:02] rising of another son.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; As Christ was the first one to raise
[2:01:07] from all the prophets and so forth.
[2:01:10] Although typed in many places, he was
[2:01:12] the first fruits of those that slept.
[2:01:17] In the bride coming of Christ, coming
[2:01:20] out of the church, there'll have to be a
[2:01:22] sheath waved again in the last days.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Notice in the bride coming of Christ,
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; waving of the sheath. What is the
[2:01:32] sheath? The first one to come to mature.
[2:01:34] The first one
[2:01:37] that proved it was a wheat. that proved
[2:01:39] it WAS A SHEATH. HALLELUJAH. I'M SURE
[2:01:42] YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; This waved over the people. I WANT YOU
[2:01:46] TO UNDERSTAND MALACHI 4 WAS THE first
[2:01:49] one in Laosa that came to a
[2:01:52] manifestation of a son of God.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; He was the wave sheep
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; and it was waved over the congregation.
[2:02:02] I've been around the world seven times.
[2:02:03] What was God doing? weaving the sheep
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; to show the rest of the field what it
[2:02:09] will become.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; The first time there will come forth the
[2:02:18] bright age
[2:02:20] for a resurrection out of dark
[2:02:22] denominationalism will be a message.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; That the full maturity of the word has
[2:02:28] turned back again in full power and
[2:02:31] being waved over the people by the same
[2:02:33] signs and wonders. as he did back then.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Now, in closing, musicians, if you want
[2:02:40] to come,
[2:02:42] here's something very astounding I found
[2:02:45] in the message
[2:02:51] in the seven church age book. Brother
[2:02:53] Brandon preaches this, but now he's
[2:02:56] standing in the midst of the church,
[2:03:00] and he stands there revealing who he is
[2:03:02] in this last age.
[2:03:04] He calls himself the author
[2:03:07] of the creation of God.
[2:03:11] This is another creation.
[2:03:16] This has to do with the church.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; This is a special designation of
[2:03:22] himself.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Wow. Look at this. Let this sink in.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; This is a special designation OF
[2:03:32] HIMSELF.
[2:03:34] HE IS THE CREATOR OF that church.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; The heavenly bridegroom
[2:03:42] created
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; his own bride.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; The heavenly bridegroom created
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; his own bride.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; How'd he do it? He spoke the word.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; And she will be like this. And she will
[2:04:02] be like that.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; She will have this virtue. She will be
[2:04:06] like of this character.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; She will be dressed like this. This is
[2:04:10] how she'll act. This is how she'll talk.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? This message has had
[2:04:17] a profound effect. If this message has
[2:04:19] not had a profound effect upon you,
[2:04:23] listen to me. I doubt your seed.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Say it like it is.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:30] But if you are elect seed, what will it
[2:04:32] do? IT'LL HAVE AN EFFECT.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; WHY? COME UP HIGHER.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE. BE SEPARATE,
[2:04:41] SAITH GOD.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; The heavenly bridegroom created his own
[2:04:48] bride.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; As the spirit of God, he came down and
[2:04:53] created in the Virgin Mary the cells
[2:04:56] which his body was born.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:59] And I want to repeat that he created the
[2:05:02] very cells in the womb of Mary for that
[2:05:04] body. It was not enough for the Holy
[2:05:07] Spirit to simply give life to human oam
[2:05:10] supplied by Mary.
[2:05:13] That would have been a sinful man
[2:05:15] mankind producing a baby
[2:05:18] that would have not produced the last
[2:05:21] Adam of him. It was said, "Lo, a body
[2:05:25] hast thou prepared?
[2:05:27] Hast thou father prepared for me?
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Not Mary
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; provided that body.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Mary was a human incubator.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; And she carried the holy child and
[2:05:43] brought him forth.
[2:05:45] It's it was a God man.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; He was the son of God.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; He was the new creation. Man and God met
[2:05:53] and joined. He was the first one of the
[2:05:56] new race. He is the head of this new
[2:05:58] race. Colossians 1 verse 18 says, "And
[2:06:01] he is the head of the body, the church,
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; who is the beginning, the firstborn
[2:06:07] from the dead, that all things might
[2:06:10] have the preeminence."
[2:06:13] 2 Corinthians 5:1 17, "Therefore, if any
[2:06:16] man be in Christ,
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; he is a new creation.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Old things have passed away. Behold, all
[2:06:23] things are become new.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; There you can see through
[2:06:29] that. Though man was of the old order of
[2:06:33] creation, now in the union with Christ,
[2:06:36] YOU ARE YOU FOLLOWING THIS?
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; We're talking about uniting time and
[2:06:40] sight.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; BY THIS UNION WITH CHRIST, he has become
[2:06:44] the new creation of God. Ephesians 2
[2:06:47] and10 says, "For we are his workmanship,
[2:06:50] created in union with Christ Jesus unto
[2:06:54] good works."
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4 and 24, "That you put on the
[2:06:59] new man, which after God is created in
[2:07:02] righteousness and true holiness."
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; This new creation
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; is not the old creation made over
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; or could not be called a new creation.
[2:07:15] That's exactly what it says. It's a new
[2:07:17] creation.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; It's another creation distinct from the
[2:07:21] old one. No longer is he dealing with
[2:07:24] the ways of the flesh.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; That was how he dealt with Israel. How
[2:07:29] he chose Abraham and Abraham's issue
[2:07:32] through the body, the God godly Isaac
[2:07:36] line. But now out of every kindred,
[2:07:39] tribe, and nation, he has purposed a new
[2:07:42] creation.
[2:07:44] He was the first of that creation.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; He was God created in the form of man.
[2:07:48] Now by his spirit he is creating many
[2:07:51] sons unto himself.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Do you see this new creation?
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; He's creating a bride.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; She's made up of many members
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; and yet she's one body.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; And God the creator creating himself a
[2:08:10] part of the creation. This is the true
[2:08:13] revelation of God. This was his purpose.
[2:08:16] This purpose took form through election.
[2:08:19] That is why he could look down
[2:08:23] to the last stage when all would be over
[2:08:26] and see himself stood in the midst of
[2:08:29] the church as author
[2:08:31] of the new creation of God. His
[2:08:33] sovereign power brought it to pass by
[2:08:36] his own decree. He elected the members
[2:08:39] of this new creation. He predestinated
[2:08:41] them the adoption of children according
[2:08:43] to the good pleasure of his will.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; By his omnipotent, his omniscience and
[2:08:50] omnipotence,
[2:08:52] he brought it to pass. How else could
[2:08:58] he know that he would be standing in the
[2:09:01] midst of the church receiving glory from
[2:09:04] his brethren
[2:09:06] if he did not make sure all things he
[2:09:09] knew and all things he worked out
[2:09:12] according to what he knew in order that
[2:09:15] his purpose and good pleasure be brought
[2:09:18] to pass. Ephesians 2:11, "In whom also
[2:09:20] have we have obtained an inheritance,
[2:09:23] being predestined." Understand this. A
[2:09:26] woman in scripture
[2:09:29] has her inheritance through her husband
[2:09:34] because when she's joined to her
[2:09:36] husband, she's joint hes with his
[2:09:39] inheritance.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; So understand a woman
[2:09:45] herself.
[2:09:46] That's why
[2:09:48] Every man should have a wife. But yet we
[2:09:51] know there are some born within the body
[2:09:53] who are Unix.
[2:09:55] I'm not going to go into that.
[2:09:59] But for every atom, there is an E.
[2:10:04] I remember my mother telling me one
[2:10:06] time, she says, "No matter how ugly the
[2:10:09] man is
[2:10:12] or how unattractive,
[2:10:15] there'll be some woman they'll find
[2:10:18] him."
[2:10:20] Come on, man. You have seen some and
[2:10:22] thought, "What in the world did you huh?
[2:10:27] What did you see in him?" Now I want YOU
[2:10:30] TO UNDERSTAND GOD does not look at THE
[2:10:32] OUTWARD APPEARANCE
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD LOOKS at
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; the inward man.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; God wasn't looking at you on how
[2:10:43] beautiful you are,
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; how manly or how FEMININE YOU ARE.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; GOD LOOKS AT YOU BECAUSE WHEN HE SEES
[2:10:52] YOU, HE SEES HIMSELF.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; HE LOOKS AT THE CHARACTER, NOT THE
[2:10:56] BEAUTY. BECAUSE beauty is vain
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; and it passes away and how quickly it
[2:11:03] passes.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Take a bride 18, 20 years of age.
[2:11:13] Give her several children,
[2:11:16] a few sunrises and sunsets.
[2:11:25] I was one time in in brother Dennis
[2:11:28] Oldm's house. His mother invited us over
[2:11:32] for dinner.
[2:11:34] Her husband had died many years before.
[2:11:38] And Dennis said, "My mom wants to cook
[2:11:40] you a meal. Would you come over?" I
[2:11:42] said, "Okay." So she greeted me. Oh, it
[2:11:45] was such a nice greeting.
[2:11:47] She said, "Brother Ron, just make
[2:11:48] yourself at home. Just look around. Go
[2:11:50] ahead." And there was all these photos
[2:11:52] and there was a picture of a beautiful
[2:11:55] bride on the mantle.
[2:11:57] My very feminine, very beautiful woman.
[2:12:02] I said, "Sister Oldm,"
[2:12:06] in my ignorance,
[2:12:08] I said, "Sister Oldm, who is this?
[2:12:12] I don't recognize her." Here she was
[2:12:15] cooking.
[2:12:20] Here she
[2:12:23] brother Ron,
[2:12:26] that's me.
[2:12:28] I thought, oh my,
[2:12:32] how quickly, sisters,
[2:12:35] your beauty
[2:12:36] will fade. No matter how beautiful you
[2:12:40] are, no matter what kind of lotion you
[2:12:42] put on your skin, no matter what kind of
[2:12:45] covering you put upon your body,
[2:12:50] it's dying.
[2:12:54] Your beauty will fade.
[2:12:56] But there is a beauty that lies within
[2:12:58] the elect
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; that is not, you know what that beauty
[2:13:03] is? It's the character
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; of Christ.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; That's the beauty.
[2:13:08] Take not your outward appearance like
[2:13:11] the women do in the world of the
[2:13:13] braiding of hair and wearing of clothes
[2:13:15] and trying to make herself look
[2:13:18] beautiful.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; But let it be the hidden man of Christ
[2:13:22] within each and every one of you.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; So he now
[2:13:31] is creating for himself
[2:13:34] a bride.
[2:13:37] How did he do it? He sent a prophet.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; And that prophet began to speak.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; He began to tell us
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; sermons like choosing a bride.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "This is what this bride will
[2:13:53] be like.
[2:13:55] She'll have character.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; Her beauty will not come from Hollywood,
[2:14:00] but from the holy word." Amen.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; He began to tell us how God would be,
[2:14:05] what he was looking for, what kind of
[2:14:07] character,
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; what kind of virtue she would have
[2:14:14] until
[2:14:15] what you realize
[2:14:18] that God was looking at a mirror of
[2:14:20] himself.
[2:14:24] She'll look like she'll look like me
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; in feminine form. That's why brother
[2:14:31] Brennham said, "Watch." As the word was
[2:14:34] in Mary,
[2:14:36] he says, "So will the bride of this last
[2:14:39] day. She will bear an image
[2:14:42] of the husband,
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; my brother, my sister.
[2:14:48] God 2,000 years ago gave a gift
[2:14:52] to the world.
[2:14:54] Wasn't very pretty.
[2:14:57] the rapper.
[2:14:59] There was no beauty in him that we
[2:15:01] should desire him. The clothing he wore
[2:15:05] did not differentiate him
[2:15:08] from anyone else. In fact, when they
[2:15:10] went to make him a king and it wasn't
[2:15:14] time.
[2:15:15] He walked out among them and they
[2:15:18] couldn't find him.
[2:15:22] God is revealed in simplicity. Amen.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Look what God is doing in this day.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; Has he not chosen
[2:15:33] the things of this world that the the
[2:15:36] world looks at and said they're nothing?
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; But has not God chosen the foolish
[2:15:42] things?
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; That's why I say to all of you and you
[2:15:46] young people, you listen to me. God has
[2:15:48] called you.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; He's chosen you.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You are the foolish THINGS OF THIS
[2:15:56] WORLD. DON'T BE foolish
[2:15:59] and follow the things of this world
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; because he who seeks to save his life
[2:16:07] shall lose it.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; But he who seeks to lose his life for my
[2:16:10] sake shall find it.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; God
[2:16:16] is creating his own bride.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; How'd he do it? Spoken word.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; That's what this message is all about.
[2:16:25] It's creating a bride.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; That's why
[2:16:29] she understands
[2:16:31] the things that God wants her to do.
[2:16:33] Why? It's revealed to her.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "If I can get this
[2:16:40] bride to stand still long enough, I'll
[2:16:42] dress her in the word."
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; Why? Because Ela eer. Okay? He went out
[2:16:49] to find a bride for Isaac.
[2:16:54] Ezer did not court the bride.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; He didn't try to cause her to fall in
[2:17:00] love with him.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Neither did this messenger
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; want you to fall in love with him.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "No." He said, "Yes, I want the
[2:17:09] people to love me that I can bring them
[2:17:11] to you."
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what was so attractive
[2:17:18] about this message. It had no Hollywood
[2:17:21] flare.
[2:17:26] There was no beauty in it.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; In fact, when I heard about holiness,
[2:17:31] I said to there is no holiness in in the
[2:17:35] world of religion today.
[2:17:38] You see, hey, look churches, go live any
[2:17:41] kind of life you want and
[2:17:44] dress any way you want to dress.
[2:17:47] Doesn't matter how you live.
[2:17:50] Doesn't matter what you put on. And I
[2:17:52] ask you, if that doesn't matter, why
[2:17:54] does God put it in his word?
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; God bless you. I appreciate all of you
[2:18:00] this morning. And like I said, it was
[2:18:02] going to be a different service. And
[2:18:08] the thought that came to me, and I I had
[2:18:10] never read that quote before.
[2:18:13] If I did, it didn't come to me that God
[2:18:17] was creating a bride for himself.
[2:18:21] Are you not his workmanship?
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; And yet he's not done with you yet.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; How many of you can say he's still
[2:18:32] working on me?
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; I am his workmanship
[2:18:38] and when I get out of line and
[2:18:39] everything and the the clay, has not the
[2:18:43] potter power over the clay to make it a
[2:18:45] vessel of honor or dishonor? How many
[2:18:48] times has God had to rework your life a
[2:18:51] little bit?
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Get out of sorts, and all of a sudden
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; the potter takes his hand,
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; breaks down the
[2:18:59] the figure that it's making.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's not the way. That's
[2:19:04] that's not the form, the shape that I
[2:19:06] want it."
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; And then God,
[2:19:09] he's got to add water to the clay to
[2:19:12] make it soft.
[2:19:14] Some of you get so hardened by the
[2:19:16] things of this world till when God wants
[2:19:20] to deal with you. The clay is so hard it
[2:19:22] can't be molded.
[2:19:24] That's why you've got to pray. Seek the
[2:19:26] mind of God.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; Let your spirit become soft before God
[2:19:31] and say, "Lord,
[2:19:33] work me.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; Take me and remold me. Make me the image
[2:19:38] the way you would want me to be."
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. Let's stand
[2:19:43] together this morning.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; Thy word
[2:19:55] according to thy proises.
[2:20:01] I can stand
[2:20:04] secure
[2:20:08] upon
[2:20:09] my heart.
[2:20:12] the truth that sets me free
[2:20:18] according to thy word.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; Let's sing the song of Mary.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Freedom
[2:20:31] to me
[2:20:34] according to thy word,
[2:20:40] according to thy proises.
[2:20:45] I am sore
[2:20:51] not
[2:20:56] the truth that sets me free
[2:21:01] according to thy word
[2:21:09] to Jes.
[2:21:19] Let me be a vessel
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; that I might bring forth the reflection
[2:21:27] of the word that I've received.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; We say that we believe all this and we
[2:21:34] believe all the word.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Then Lord, let there be a reflection.
[2:21:39] Why? Because the bride will be a
[2:21:42] reflection of him.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; She'll be a reflection of his word. She
[2:21:45] will be his virtue, his character.
[2:21:48] Because the same mind that was in
[2:21:50] Christ. Paul said, "Let this mind that
[2:21:54] was in Christ be in you."
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; That you might become the mystery
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; in this age
[2:22:02] revealed in its season. That's right.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; That's why Malachi 4 when he came,
[2:22:07] Revelation 7, when he began to sound,
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; the sounding of his message revealed the
[2:22:14] mystery of who you are.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; You began to see a reflection of
[2:22:21] yourself in the word
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; and said, "That's me.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; I saw something about it, a reflection."
[2:22:30] How many of you believe that? Amen.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[2:22:39] Here it is. Christmas time.
[2:22:42] Brought forth a different kind of a
[2:22:44] Christmas message. I'm not here to take
[2:22:46] you back and to rejoice about some
[2:22:49] historical
[2:22:51] god who was born thousands of years ago.
[2:22:56] Are they coming here to be prayed for?
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Come on up here.
[2:23:02] God bless you.
[2:23:12] I promise
[2:23:16] I can
[2:23:24] my heart
[2:23:27] truth that sets me free
[2:23:32] according
[2:23:40] to me.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; How do you explain?
[2:23:48] I'll be destroyed.
[2:23:54] A love that goes from east to west
[2:23:59] and runs as the bastard in one.
[2:24:06] You know all our
[2:24:11] and you know all our fears.
[2:24:16] The work can I express the love we feel
[2:24:22] we long for you to hear.
[2:24:28] Listen to our
[2:24:31] heart.
[2:24:33] Hear our spirit sing.
[2:24:50] We will use the words we know
[2:24:54] to tell you what an awesome God you are.
[2:25:01] Words are not enough to tell you.
[2:25:11] Amen. God bless you richly all of you
[2:25:15] today. Our brother Isaiah, thank you for
[2:25:17] coming.
[2:25:19] You brought your c tambourine up here,
[2:25:21] but you didn't use it.

[2:25:26] could Huh? Bring that tambourine. You
[2:25:28] guys just sit down a second. We're going
[2:25:30] to worship God, and we're going to let
[2:25:32] brother Isaiah bless us. And how many'd
[2:25:34] like to be blessed by another song?
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[2:25:48] Praise the Lord. God bless you, brother
[2:25:50] Isaiah Brooks.
