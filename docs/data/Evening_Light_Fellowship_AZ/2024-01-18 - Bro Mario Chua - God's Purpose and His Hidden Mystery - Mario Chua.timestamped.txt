[26:11] in town without having him to minister
[26:14] I'm allowing it it won't happen
[26:16] again uh uh but brother Mano come up
[26:20] here seasoned veteran Pastor been
[26:22] through many experiences he was there uh
[26:24] he was privileged to actually be in the
[26:26] meetings of brother br he said he was
[26:28] there um during the six Services of
[26:31] brother Brenham preaching marriage and
[26:33] divorce and um many of us did not have
[26:37] an opportunity to see that Prophet to
[26:39] hear him preach and to come under that
[26:42] but the Bible
[26:44] says uh blessed are those who have not
[26:46] seen amen and yet believe brother meno
[26:49] we love you thank you uh we respect you
[26:52] just for 2,000 huh an hour is okay an
[26:56] hour is good Mario will be blessed he'll
[26:59] he'll in seon out of season but uh men
[27:03] what do you see for
[27:05] 2024 as an expectation as a seasoned
[27:09] believer
[27:11] please not past
[27:15] tonight I appreciate what how brother
[27:17] Bram told us to live he said plan like
[27:19] you've got a 100 years but live like
[27:22] he's coming in the morning amen that's
[27:25] how we go to bed every night we've been
[27:27] all these good years I count them great
[27:29] years my whole life
[27:31] basically since I was 23 years old and
[27:35] now I'm
[27:36] 81 at 23 years old I heard brother Brian
[27:39] preach those
[27:41] messages running from the presence of
[27:43] the Lord all the way through marriage
[27:46] and divorce this day is the scripture
[27:47] fulfilled who is this MDC on and I can
[27:52] say this from that time on even though I
[27:54] was surrendered to the Lord before that
[27:57] already is why we
[27:59] went but from that time my whole life
[28:02] has never been the same amen it couldn't
[28:05] be because the Deep was calling to the
[28:07] deep and yes sir that's the point that
[28:10] God makes he knows where his sheep are
[28:13] they scattered across the world and he
[28:16] might pick up a person and use him for
[28:18] one thing I know we'd all like to sing
[28:21] to like tonight we're saying Lord you
[28:23] want to be so filled with the Holy Ghost
[28:25] that no matter where you go there's an
[28:27] around you you just like to be that way
[28:30] but we are human as well that's right
[28:32] we're still in this body Paul told us
[28:35] how that he himself had uh to contend
[28:39] with his flesh as we all do but knowing
[28:43] that the flesh is never redeemed until
[28:46] we change this body or the Rapture takes
[28:50] place we till that time then what I want
[28:53] to do I do not what I would do I what I
[28:56] would not do I do
[28:58] and Paul said there's a law but there's
[28:59] a law of the spirit as well yes sir and
[29:01] the law of the holy spirit always brings
[29:03] us back to his word knowing now that we
[29:06] are in him before the foundation of the
[29:07] world and years mean so little now I'm
[29:10] thinking uh often you know how you look
[29:12] forward look forward brother on that's
[29:13] how we look forward in 24 I don't
[29:16] know look I was there when we were were
[29:18] before
[29:20] 77 every move we made getting closer
[29:24] getting closer getting closer but much
[29:26] of it was what the Prophet had said and
[29:28] as we all know brother Ram spoke the in
[29:32] the message from the
[29:35] indictment till
[29:38] communion he took his whole life and
[29:41] surrendered to call out a bride and to
[29:43] dress her make her ready to take on the
[29:47] resurrection and the Rapture that was
[29:49] his whole message so he spoke it as
[29:52] though it would happen while he was
[29:55] here he did yes sir but you know in
[29:58] God's time just a few seconds
[30:01] now and one place you said is that
[30:03] though God was Raising from his
[30:06] seat he said that two three minutes
[30:10] ago that's about all it's been these
[30:13] last 50 to 60
[30:16] years and but look how many were not
[30:18] even born and God has saved them now
[30:20] here your sitting we thought we were the
[30:22] last ones and I'll tell you honestly
[30:24] when God called me and I saw I heard
[30:26] brother Brown say certain things I felt
[30:27] so bad I felt I was born out of season
[30:30] oh if I could have just lived there when
[30:32] the message was really there little did
[30:34] I realize that I would take the full
[30:37] benefit and have the full benefit of the
[30:40] message in the third pool in the open
[30:42] word prior to that they're aiming
[30:44] towards aiming toward but one day he
[30:45] said this day is this scripture
[30:47] fulfilled we have
[30:49] arrived we have arrived when is it I
[30:51] don't know but we have

[38:22] leading and he just directed me to the
[38:26] book called Christ is the mystery of God
[38:29] revealed yes sir but I will not preach
[38:31] the whole Christ is the mystery of
[38:33] God I we know that it is already being
[38:37] preached but I believe as the prophet
[38:40] said keep on digging and more will
[38:42] unfold that's right so we will just take
[38:46] uh some nuggets as the Lord leads amen
[38:50] take the highlights and bring it into
[38:52] the present tense uh Colossians 1 verse
[38:58] 2 26
[39:02] 27 it's just a simple thought and uh
[39:07] it's just to refresh our
[39:10] memories of the things that we have
[39:12] already
[39:13] heard amen Colossians 1:
[39:18] 26-27 it says even the mystery which had
[39:23] been hid from ages and from Generations
[39:27] but is now present tense in our
[39:30] generation is made manifest to his Saint
[39:34] sir amen made manifest means to make
[39:37] clear Amen to be made
[39:40] visible now in our generation thank you
[39:44] Lord to whom God would make known what
[39:47] is the riches of the glory of this
[39:49] mystery among the Gentiles amen so the
[39:52] message is supposed to be to the
[39:55] Israelites to the Jew but they rejected
[39:58] it and it was given to us thank you Lord
[40:02] hallelujah The Riches of the glory of
[40:05] this mystery among the Gentiles we are
[40:08] foreigners outside of Israelites we are
[40:11] foreigners we are eaten we are
[40:14] unbelievers but it was the grace of God
[40:17] hallelujah that was given to us Amen to
[40:20] whom God M would make known what is the
[40:23] riches of the glory of this mystery
[40:25] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[40:28] you the hope of
[40:31] glory god in men living in Man by his
[40:35] Spirit as the nature of man guide him
[40:39] him and leading him by his spirit amen
[40:42] amen and it's a great thing that's right
[40:46] then Revelation
[40:50] 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the
[40:54] seventh angel when when he shall begin
[40:57] to sound the mystery of God should be
[41:00] finished amen as he ha declared to his
[41:04] servants the prophets and may the Lord
[41:07] add the blessing upon the reading of his
[41:08] word you may now be
[41:10] seated praise the Lord
[41:14] amen so as the Lord directed me to the
[41:19] uh book Christ is the mystery of God
[41:21] revealed so I'll take my
[41:24] title uh here where and he said now God
[41:27] had a purpose and a hidden Mystery so
[41:30] that's my title tonight God's purpose
[41:33] and his hidden
[41:36] Mystery now God had a purpose and a
[41:38] hidden Mystery and that's what I want to
[41:40] speak on to the church this morning the
[41:43] hidden Mystery of God that he had in his
[41:46] mind before the word ever began and how
[41:49] it is unfolded right down to this
[41:51] present hour that we are living in so
[41:54] here is a man who preach with
[41:58] authority he is not just an ordinary man
[42:01] that can preach what is the
[42:04] hidden or the purpose of God and the
[42:07] hidden Mystery before the foundation of
[42:09] the world Amen so he is not he did come
[42:13] from any the background and sometimes we
[42:17] cannot even hear some Scholars or
[42:19] teaching that is preaching about the
[42:20] hidden Mystery of God but here is a man
[42:24] with full Authority and he said that's
[42:27] what I want to speak to the church this
[42:30] morning men with authority it was just
[42:33] like Jesus Christ when he was here on
[42:35] Earth he went to the synagogue and
[42:38] preached the gospel open the scripture
[42:40] and all those people were
[42:43] asist Hallelujah and they even question
[42:46] them themselves where did this come from
[42:48] what school or denomination he did come
[42:51] from because he speak with
[42:53] authority amen we are glad that brother
[42:55] Bram Hallelujah is the prophet that God
[42:58] sent in this last days because the
[43:00] mystery of God according to Amos 3:7 the
[43:04] Lord surely the Lord can do nothing or
[43:07] The God can do nothing except he
[43:09] revealed the secret things that's right
[43:13] to his servant the prophet that's right
[43:15] the secret things belong to God but the
[43:18] revelations belong to a special class of
[43:22] people hallelujah those people that he
[43:24] are chosen
[43:26] elected selected predestinated
[43:30] Justified Sanctified called and
[43:34] glorified am this message is for a
[43:37] special class of people that's why the
[43:40] secret is only for the bride special
[43:43] class of people that's why he said to
[43:46] speak to the church this morning the
[43:48] hidden Mystery of God that he had in his
[43:51] mind before the word ever began and how
[43:53] it unfolded itself right down to this
[43:56] present hour that we are living in God
[43:58] is unfolding unfolding his great mystery
[44:02] he has he had made known this mystery
[44:05] now being made manifest now being made
[44:07] clear in this
[44:09] generation praise the Lord he keep on
[44:13] unfolding and the life that we live now
[44:15] is the
[44:16] unfolding of what was in the mind of God
[44:19] before the foundation of the world
[44:22] Hallelujah God called us not by accident
[44:26] it is a chosen people in time and season
[44:29] that we need to manifest what was the
[44:31] thought of God before the foundation of
[44:33] the
[44:34] world unfolded itself right down to this
[44:38] present hour that we are living then you
[44:41] will understand clearly you see oh I
[44:44] believe what is being
[44:46] done God is doing something in this
[44:50] generation God is unfolding right now
[44:53] that's why somebody said oh we thank God
[44:56] for what he has done and he is doing but
[44:59] they are not recognizing what he is
[45:01] doing right now that's right and the
[45:03] prophet in this last day said you need
[45:05] to recognize your day and your message
[45:08] God is doing something in this
[45:11] generation and we are the people the
[45:13] beneficiary the recipient of that
[45:16] unfolding of Christ in these last days
[45:19] hallelujah God's great mystery about is
[45:23] a secret he kept it a secret and nobody
[45:26] know nothing about it even the angels
[45:29] didn't understand it that's right
[45:31] remember when he preached chrisis a
[45:33] mystery of God
[45:35] revealed he preached four months before
[45:38] he preached about the seven seal he
[45:40] preached about the first to The Sixth
[45:43] Seal and when he come to the seventh
[45:45] seal there was silence in heaven for
[45:48] half an hour and it stopped
[45:52] there he didn't continue but four month
[45:56] before now he is preaching Christ is the
[45:59] mystery of God will and his thought
[46:02] continue he say he didn't reveal it that
[46:05] the reason our our seventh mystery when
[46:08] the seventh sealed was open there was
[46:10] silence in heaven he speaking about the
[46:13] seven seal because when he preached the
[46:15] seven seal in March of
[46:18] 1963 there was silence he didn't
[46:21] continue he didn't explain it now he
[46:24] beginning praise God to pick up those
[46:27] thought and bring it in Christ is the
[46:29] mystery of God revealed praise the Lord
[46:31] now paragraph 173 when Jesus when he was
[46:35] on Earth they wanted to know when he
[46:37] would come so he's giving an a hint that
[46:42] the seven seal is the coming of the
[46:45] Lord
[46:48] right so he cot there was silence in
[46:51] heaven then the next paragraph he said
[46:53] Jesus when he was here on Earth they
[46:55] wanted to know when he would
[46:58] come speaking about the second coming of
[47:01] Christ he said it's not even the son
[47:05] himself don't know when it's going to
[47:08] happen but we know that he's coming
[47:12] amen God has this all to himself it's a
[47:17] secret and that's the reason there was
[47:19] silence in heaven for a space of an hour
[47:21] and seven Thunders after their
[47:24] voices so if we keep it up if we pick it
[47:28] up he said that the reason there was
[47:29] silence in heaven for space of half an
[47:32] hour so is quoting Revelation
[47:37] 8:1 it says that and when he had opened
[47:40] the seventh seal there was silence in
[47:42] heaven about the space of half an hour
[47:46] so he pick up the tote when he preached
[47:48] the seven seal he continue
[47:51] that so see God has this is a sequence
[47:55] that's the reason there was silence in
[47:57] heaven for a space of an hour and seven
[47:58] Thunders after their voices this is
[48:00] another scripture he TI up Revelation 81
[48:03] to Revelation 10 the seven Thunders and
[48:07] seven Thunders utter their voices and
[48:09] John was even forbidden to write and he
[48:12] said the coming of the
[48:15] Lord so Revelation 8 there was silence
[48:18] in heaven no angel clapping no no
[48:22] Hallelujah no shouting it was the secret
[48:26] coming of the Lord that's why in
[48:28] Revelation 10 he said the mighty angel
[48:30] came down with an open book amen the
[48:33] closed book in Revelation chap 5 that no
[48:36] one knows or woring to open now it's an
[48:40] open book in Revelation chapter
[48:43] 10 yes
[48:46] sir that's one thing he hasn't revealed
[48:50] yet speaking about the
[48:52] coming of how he will come and when he
[48:56] will
[48:57] come he hasn't revealed yet of how and
[49:00] when he will come but he is coming
[49:03] that's right it's a good thing that he
[49:06] doesn't hallelujah it's a good thing
[49:09] that he hasn't he don't need to speak it
[49:12] because the angel of the Lord said don't
[49:14] tell you have already tell the first fo
[49:16] and the second fool and it was
[49:18] impersonated so dist third po don't
[49:20] speak it it's a complete silence no one
[49:23] knows and that's the coming of the Lord
[49:26] that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet
[49:28] of how and when he will come it's a good
[49:31] thing that he doesn't yes
[49:35] amen he has showed or revealed every
[49:38] type that's in the Bible that secret
[49:41] coming Hallelujah he already showed it
[49:44] in types and shadows in the Old
[49:46] Testament that's right Hallelujah and he
[49:49] has showed to reveal it in every types
[49:51] that's in the Bible shown what he's
[49:54] coming
[49:56] in every type in the B therefore the
[49:58] entire mystery of the Bible is the
[50:00] revelation of God's mystery in
[50:03] Christ so all the stories of the Bible
[50:06] from Genesis through Revelation were
[50:08] encoded in this great mystery yes
[50:10] brother and the secret of his coming and
[50:13] the revealing of
[50:15] himself Hallelujah and so it was the
[50:18] secret that was sealed up until this end
[50:21] time age when God to the Sabbath Angels
[50:24] Ministry would come and make it known to
[50:27] the predestinated
[50:29] people and the Mystery of our name was
[50:31] written in all those stories of your
[50:33] life in this day making you a part of
[50:36] the mystery that is being revealed today
[50:39] amen as Christ as Christ is the mystery
[50:43] of God revealed you the bride is the
[50:46] mystery of Christ
[50:49] revealed because the full mystery
[50:51] requires both husband and wife
[50:53] Hallelujah to show the complete
[50:56] mystery remember the entire Bible was
[50:59] written for this end time age because
[51:01] everything that was
[51:02] written Hallelujah in seed form in the
[51:05] Bible comes to manifestation at the
[51:08] Harvest Time which is the end time yes
[51:10] sir we are now manifesting the fullness
[51:13] of all those

[51:43] from the nation second Exodus from the
[51:46] law to Grace but the Third Exodus come
[51:48] out from denominations among them and we
[51:51] have the promised land which is the
[51:53] revealed word of the hour we living the

[53:52] message of the hour came down to let us
[53:55] us know who we are to give us Faith to
[53:58] believe his message we are living in the
[54:01] time of Easter when she come into the
[54:04] union with the King and come into the
[54:07] full realization of her position is how
[54:11] we are also coming into full
[54:13] realizations of our position in this day
[54:17] amen because the message of the hour
[54:20] Hallelujah will bring us in our position
[54:22] in this last day this is the adaption
[54:24] time
[54:26] we are living in the time when Joseph is
[54:28] about to dismiss his gentle wife to the
[54:31] palace and reveal himself to his Breen
[54:34] on and on we could go because the entire
[54:36] Bible was written for this Harvest hour
[54:39] of where the seed becomes manifested at
[54:42] the Harvest time that's why when I first
[54:44] received the message of the Y I was so
[54:46] attracted by the message of the prophet
[54:48] he always preach about the Old Testament
[54:51] character and then I so enjoy it and I
[54:55] cannot forget it because he bring the
[54:57] Old Testament Saints into the present
[55:00] tense that's right and I identify myself
[55:02] in all those character and come to think
[55:06] of it and realize that we are the
[55:08] mystery that is being revealed in all
[55:10] those Testament until this time and the
[55:14] riches of the glory of God hallelujah
[55:17] will be made known in this last day
[55:19] thank you Lord this is what the Seven's
[55:22] heill has sealed until this time this
[55:24] was the hidden Mana that was sealed yes
[55:27] sir up until these last days this is the
[55:29] bread of life that has been broken to us
[55:32] in this hour of him walking with us in
[55:36] this day
[55:37] amen in the message Feast of the trumpet
[55:40] look I want to say one more thing
[55:42] closely don't miss this how striking
[55:45] from the seventh Angels message in
[55:49] Revelation 10 was the seven
[55:52] seal amen so the seventh seal message
[55:57] was the message oh the seventh Angels
[56:01] message was the message of the seven
[56:05] seal which was Revelation
[56:09] 10 and I trust that we are matured
[56:11] enough we are belong to the message of
[56:13] the hour amen we always hear about the
[56:17] seal about the seven tunders and we know
[56:20] that the seal is only a
[56:23] seal seven seal there are seven seal and
[56:26] the book is not this kind of book we
[56:29] understand it and the book is just a
[56:30] scroll being sealed amen with seven seal
[56:34] and when you open the seven seal it open
[56:37] up first to six
[56:43] seal so the seven seal is just a
[56:47] covering of the
[56:49] book but the inside content of that book
[56:53] right is the the seventh Thunder of
[56:56] Revelation
[56:57] 10 amen amen so that's why he came down
[57:00] with an open book in his hand and he
[57:03] gave the message to the seventh
[57:06] angel the seventh angel of Revelation 10
[57:09] and the seventh angel of Revelations is
[57:12] at at the time is here on
[57:15] Earth just like John introduced Jesus
[57:18] Christ and when brother bam is he need
[57:21] to introduce the Christ amen in the form
[57:24] of the word not in the form of human
[57:26] being that's right that's why it's an
[57:28] open book
[57:30] yes amen the content of the book is the
[57:34] seventh
[57:36] Thunder and it takes the seventh angel
[57:39] to reveal what was in the Thunder amen
[57:42] so the first coming of Christ was in the
[57:44] form of revealing of the Man Called
[57:46] Jesus but the second coming would be the
[57:49] form of revealing of the
[57:51] word and not in the body of men
[57:57] but now that word is manifested in a
[58:00] body of a woman the
[58:04] bride Hallelujah because the
[58:07] manifestations of the second coming of
[58:09] Christ will be completed in the form of
[58:12] a woman which is his wife Allelujah
[58:16] remember that it required both Adam and
[58:21] Eve male and female to fully revealed
[58:25] Adam amen he could not be called Adam
[58:29] unless Eve was being made
[58:32] manifest male and female and God called
[58:35] them
[58:36] Adam so it will take the entire body of
[58:39] Jesus and his bride to fully reveal
[58:41] Christ amen hallelujah the second Adam
[58:44] this was God's stold purpose first to
[58:47] express himself in Christ praise God
[58:50] then to have the
[58:54] and then to restore the Fallen Kingdom
[58:56] by restoring everything that Adam lost
[58:59] in Aiden oh Hallelujah you need to have
[59:02] preeminence and what is preeminent that
[59:05] means he is the
[59:06] first in
[59:08] everything first in importance first in
[59:12] honor first in exaltation Hallelujah
[59:15] because Jesus is the head he said I am
[59:18] the beginning and I am the ending I am
[59:21] the Alpha and the Omega that's why Paul
[59:24] wrote In Colossians he said that
[59:25] whatsoever things you do yeah in words
[59:30] or in
[59:31] Deeds do it all in the name of our Lord
[59:34] Jesus Christ give thanks to God that's
[59:36] right and the father by him in Proverbs
[59:40] 3:6 in all thy ways let him have the
[59:44] preeminence in all thy ways acknowledge
[59:47] Him and He Shall direct thy path amen
[59:51] thank you Lord God wants preeminence
[59:53] Hallelujah
[59:55] praise God so in the message Christ The
[59:57] Mystery of God revealed paragraph 37 now
[1:00:00] he Sanctified with his spirit and blood
[1:00:04] a church that he might make every
[1:00:07] promise in this last days be revealed
[1:00:11] he's Sanctified it by his own
[1:00:13] blood he don't delegate it to any other
[1:00:17] any other that's why in Revelation 5
[1:00:21] verse one when John was being lifted up
[1:00:26] and the angel I will show you things
[1:00:27] that is going to come said and I saw in
[1:00:30] the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:00:32] throne a book written within and on the
[1:00:34] backside sealed with seven
[1:00:36] seal Hallelujah a written book and
[1:00:40] sealed with seventh seal it was a
[1:00:42] covering and I saw a strong angel
[1:00:45] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[1:00:47] worthy to open the book and to lose the
[1:00:48] seal the rope and no man in Heaven Nor
[1:00:52] in the earth neither under the Earth was
[1:00:54] able to open the book neither to look
[1:00:56] unto nobody's worth
[1:00:59] it and I John said much be and I WEP
[1:01:03] much because no man was found worthy to
[1:01:06] open and to read the
[1:01:08] book neither to look there
[1:01:11] on and one of the elders said unto me we
[1:01:15] not behold the ryion of the tribe of
[1:01:17] Judah the root of David had Prevail to
[1:01:20] open the book and to lose the seal
[1:01:23] thereof and beh low in the midst of the
[1:01:25] throne and of the forast and in the
[1:01:27] midst of the ERS stood a lamp a lamp as
[1:01:31] he had been slain Hallelujah a bloody
[1:01:35] lamp praise God so that's why he said
[1:01:39] that so that's why he said he Sanctified
[1:01:42] it with his spirit and his blood a
[1:01:45] church that he might make every promise
[1:01:50] in the last days be revealed Hallelujah
[1:01:54] Hal
[1:01:55] Hallelujah continue on Christ The
[1:01:57] Mystery of God revealed now it's easy to
[1:01:59] go back and pick up what this other
[1:02:02] fellow has left off here in the last
[1:02:04] days and by his holy spirit reveal all
[1:02:07] the mystery of the seven seal he's
[1:02:09] expressing himself amen that's his
[1:02:13] purpose that's the purpose of God to
[1:02:15] express
[1:02:18] himself
[1:02:21] Hallelujah that's his purpose that's why
[1:02:24] he
[1:02:24] that's the second fold of his three-fold
[1:02:26] manifest first to express himself in
[1:02:29] Christ and then Express himself through
[1:02:33] the church and the same thing Christ was
[1:02:36] the word and the church becomes the word
[1:02:40] when it lets the word go
[1:02:44] through and the church become the word
[1:02:48] when it lets the word go through them
[1:02:52] but when they accept a hybrid
[1:02:56] denomination and we can add more and if
[1:02:59] they accept a man-made Theory a manmade
[1:03:03] understanding Hallelujah own
[1:03:05] interpretations of the message of the
[1:03:07] hour then it cause a short and blow of
[1:03:10] fuse amen but when the current is
[1:03:14] Flowing freely the word of God it
[1:03:17] expresses itself that's why God wants
[1:03:20] preeminence God don't want our
[1:03:23] understanding or the let him have the
[1:03:26] preeminence that the word can flow
[1:03:28] through amen and we become the Church of
[1:03:31] the Living God Amen Lord hallelujah and
[1:03:35] in there there would be a Time come
[1:03:37] forth when he could express himself in
[1:03:40] the fullness of his gued goded D through
[1:03:44] his church have the preeminence in the
[1:03:47] church you did you catch it and in there

[1:09:49] that's right
[1:09:52] Hallelujah you are a witness that there
[1:09:55] is a God
[1:09:57] somewhere walking in flesh
[1:10:00] amen then we are the people that God has
[1:10:03] predestinated to be the recipient and to
[1:10:06] comprehend this thing predestinated
[1:10:10] people to comprehend this hidden secret
[1:10:13] of
[1:10:14] God no other age or no other anointing
[1:10:19] could allow you to see these things
[1:10:21] that's
[1:10:22] right say rising of the sun he is the
[1:10:26] one who opened those
[1:10:32] seal he is the
[1:10:35] seal for the whole word of God is Christ
[1:10:39] and Christ is the seal that was
[1:10:42] opened and what is the opening of the
[1:10:45] seals then revealing Christ amen
[1:10:51] hallelujah it's so simple God reveal
[1:10:54] himself in Simplicity that's
[1:10:56] right we need we don't need to have a
[1:10:59] flowery words those seal is Christ the
[1:11:03] anointed word but there are so many
[1:11:05] details about that word amen so the
[1:11:09] prophet is telling us that Christ was
[1:11:11] revealed by his word in this age by the
[1:11:14] opening of his entire mind this is
[1:11:17] coming of Christ in word form to be
[1:11:19] United with the People by revealing to
[1:11:23] them his his
[1:11:25] thought amen the the message that we
[1:11:28] receive is not a thought of a man that's
[1:11:31] right but it was the thought of God
[1:11:33] being made manifest in his servant the
[1:11:37] prophet in his first coming he was the
[1:11:40] word made flesh everybody agrees
[1:11:44] Amen in the man Christ Jesus and the
[1:11:47] thought of God we're connected to the
[1:11:49] body of Jesus Christ so Jesus Christ was
[1:11:52] the express question of the Unseen God
[1:11:55] that's right that's why in John 14:7
[1:11:59] when he's speaking about the disciples
[1:12:01] he said if you have known
[1:12:05] me you should have known my father also
[1:12:09] amen and from henceforth ye know him and
[1:12:13] have seen him that is the Declaration
[1:12:17] Hallelujah if he had known me praise God
[1:12:21] you should have known my father also so
[1:12:24] and from henceforth you know him and
[1:12:26] have seen
[1:12:28] him it seems that Philip cannot
[1:12:31] understand what he's talking about and
[1:12:32] he said Philip said unto him Lord show
[1:12:34] us the father and he sufficeth us and
[1:12:38] Jesus said unto him have I been so long
[1:12:42] with you and yet you have known me
[1:12:47] Philip you had been in the message for
[1:12:50] so many years and yet you don't know
[1:12:52] what is the message of the
[1:12:56] the message is not brother Bram that's
[1:12:58] right the message is not do this and do
[1:13:01] that amen the message is not law right
[1:13:05] that you should do this and do that the
[1:13:07] message is Christ in you the hope of
[1:13:11] glory and Jesus said have I been so long
[1:13:14] with you and yet thou has not known me
[1:13:19] Philip he that had seen
[1:13:22] me
[1:13:24] had seen the father that's right he that
[1:13:27] had seen
[1:13:28] me had seen the father because we are
[1:13:32] the second F mystery of God don't look
[1:13:35] about your
[1:13:38] physical beings look at the promise in
[1:13:42] you because you cannot receive the
[1:13:44] message of the hour by accident that's
[1:13:47] right thank you
[1:13:50] Lord he that had seen me had seen the
[1:13:52] father and how sayest thou show us the
[1:13:55] father where is the message of the
[1:13:57] hour we are the message of the hour just
[1:14:00] like the worldship where is the will I
[1:14:02] want to attend the Will I Am the will
[1:14:05] Bible where is the message of you are
[1:14:07] the message of the hour because you are
[1:14:09] manifesting Christ in Bri form in this
[1:14:12] last days you are not talking about any
[1:14:14] other denominational deas but you are
[1:14:16] talking about predestination placing all
[1:14:20] of that Hallelujah the deeper things of
[1:14:22] God hallelujah
[1:14:24] so we are not fellowshipping any
[1:14:25] denominational deas we are
[1:14:28] fellowshipping around the mind of God
[1:14:30] that is being given to us to
[1:14:33] comprehend thank you
[1:14:36] Lord believest thou not th I am in the
[1:14:40] father and the father in me the words
[1:14:44] that I speak unto you I speak not of
[1:14:48] myself but the father that dwelleth in
[1:14:51] me he doeth the work
[1:14:54] now he is explaining the
[1:14:56] Revelation amen believest thou not thy I
[1:15:00] am in the father and the father is in me
[1:15:03] the words that I speak unto you I speak
[1:15:07] not of myself
[1:15:09] amen the word that we receive is not our
[1:15:13] or word or is not the pro prophet's word
[1:15:16] it was the word of God given to the
[1:15:19] prophet so we are
[1:15:21] quoting the man of God in this last days
[1:15:24] right thank you
[1:15:26] Lord I speak not of myself but the
[1:15:29] father that dwelleth in me he doth the
[1:15:31] works and he continue on believe me that
[1:15:34] I am in the father and the father me or
[1:15:38] else
[1:15:40] believe me for the very Works
[1:15:43] sake amen so there is always an
[1:15:47] Evidence the word that I speak unto you
[1:15:50] is not mine but is the father of me but
[1:15:52] if you cannot believe believe
[1:15:55] it recognize my work that's right
[1:15:59] because he said the son can do
[1:16:02] nothing except the father show him first
[1:16:05] we as the Bride of Jesus can do nothing
[1:16:07] else except God allow or reveal himself
[1:16:10] to us amen because as brother R preached
[1:16:12] in this Sunday the word is in the bride
[1:16:15] and she knows what he wants done with
[1:16:16] the word we have now but now it is the
[1:16:20] thought of God being connected to a
[1:16:22] bride body
[1:16:23] and so now she is the word of God made
[1:16:26] manifest in this hour an end time many
[1:16:30] membered body of Christ the bride coming
[1:16:33] of Christ Christ coming in the form of
[1:16:35] the bride and he said John 14:12 at that
[1:16:40] day you shall know that I am the father
[1:16:44] and ye in me I in
[1:16:48] you at that day what day is that the
[1:16:51] day Hallelujah with when the voice of
[1:16:53] the seventh angel begin to sound the
[1:16:57] mystery of who you are and who I am is
[1:17:00] already finish Hallelujah we just need
[1:17:03] to walk in the light of God hallelujah
[1:17:06] just like Enoch walk yes sir he walks in
[1:17:09] the light because the light is the one
[1:17:10] who guide us out of denominational
[1:17:12] Darkness we need to walk in the light as
[1:17:15] he is in the light until Hallelujah
[1:17:17] Enoch was caught up because he followed
[1:17:21] the light of his hour the light of God
[1:17:23] there that's why the prophet said there
[1:17:25] is a man here that now can turn on the
[1:17:28] light amen and greater than Solomon is
[1:17:32] here hallelujah
[1:17:34] amen in Lan age he said now this
[1:17:39] messenger of Malachi
[1:17:41] 4 and Revelation 7 is going to do
[1:17:45] things and we are fully convinced that
[1:17:47] the Malachi 4 the Elijah was send and
[1:17:51] the seventh angel messenger they are one
[1:17:54] the same person that's right and his
[1:17:56] name is William Marion
[1:17:59] Branham no questions and no doubt about
[1:18:01] it that's right everybody confused about
[1:18:04] it it's up to them but Elijah was sent
[1:18:09] to you thank you personal if you are
[1:18:14] predestinated of God Elijah was sent to
[1:18:17] you to you and you is a present tense
[1:18:22] that's right
[1:18:23] praise God it's going to two to two two
[1:18:27] things one according to Malachi he will
[1:18:29] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:18:31] fathers to he will reveal the mystery of
[1:18:34] the seven thunders in Revelation
[1:18:40] 10 Jen heard the
[1:18:43] Thunder seven thundered after their
[1:18:47] voices so Jen heard it and he understood
[1:18:51] it and he was about to write right but
[1:18:54] the don't write it John because in the
[1:18:58] last days in the Sabbath Angel when he
[1:18:59] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[1:19:01] should be
[1:19:02] finished he will reveal the mysteries of
[1:19:05] the seven thunders in Revelation 10
[1:19:08] which
[1:19:09] are the Revelation contained in the
[1:19:12] seven seal it will be this divinely
[1:19:16] revealed mystery truth that literally
[1:19:20] turned the heart of the children to the
[1:19:22] Pentecostal father and listen to the the
[1:19:25] seven thunders in Revelation 10 are the
[1:19:28] Mysteries contained in the seven seal
[1:19:33] amen the seven seal was open book and
[1:19:37] the mighty angel coming down with an
[1:19:39] open book and seven Thunders after the
[1:19:42] voices so the content of the book is the
[1:19:45] seven Thunders right and John is
[1:19:48] forbidden to write but it will take the
[1:19:50] seven Angel alah to reveal that mystery
[1:19:53] thank you Lord
[1:19:55] hallelujah so the seven seal we just
[1:19:57] covering of the books but the inside
[1:20:00] content within those seal were the
[1:20:03] tunders of Revelation chapter 10
[1:20:06] Allelujah it will be this divinely
[1:20:09] revealed truth mystery Hallelujah that
[1:20:12] will turn the heart of the children back
[1:20:14] to the faith of the father so it is
[1:20:16] preaching of the Mysteries the revealed
[1:20:19] truth of the hour that will turn the
[1:20:22] hard back to the original
[1:20:25] faith and so if we are not preaching the
[1:20:29] Ral mysterious truth then we are not
[1:20:33] preaching the message of the
[1:20:37] other denominational type of breaching
[1:20:41] nothing's against that there's so many
[1:20:43] denominational kind of breaching and it
[1:20:46] can help you become a better citizen
[1:20:49] that's it can help
[1:20:51] you have a good moral
[1:20:54] character it can make you feel good I'm
[1:20:59] good it can make you feel
[1:21:02] religious it can touch your emotion it
[1:21:05] can make you cry it can make you worship
[1:21:08] God but it can never give you rupturing
[1:21:12] Faith because rupturing faith lies in
[1:21:15] this divinely revealed mysterious truth
[1:21:19] that will give us rupturing
[1:21:21] faith thank you Lord can you say Amen to
[1:21:24] that Amen brother Bram told us that the

[1:21:56] there will be a voice there will be a
[1:21:58] Trum that was included in the seven seal
[1:22:02] it's the Eternal Church age at the end
[1:22:04] of the seal it's the winding up of all
[1:22:08] those
[1:22:10] Lucid it's the end of the struggling
[1:22:13] nature it's the end of the struggling

[1:37:35] arrived there is no more turning back
[1:37:38] Hallelujah that's why don't let those
[1:37:40] hinder you in the revelation God is
[1:37:43] trying to reveal himself to you but you
[1:37:45] let so many things under you your job
[1:37:48] your wife everything your trial and
[1:37:50] persecution Tri and sometime you say I
[1:37:52] don't want to go to church anymore I
[1:37:53] have this so many trials but that is not
[1:37:56] that the real
[1:37:57] life the real life is in the word of God
[1:38:01] we will live everything because when you
[1:38:04] are spiritually strong even know how
[1:38:07] hard is the trial the persecution it
[1:38:10] will overcome if you have the word in
[1:38:13] God that's right because the word of God
[1:38:15] bring
[1:38:18] healings healings for the Gentile is
[1:38:21] through the spoken
[1:38:25] word that's why when a gentile come to
[1:38:28] Jesus Christ if you say this if you say
[1:38:30] that Gentiles are healed by the spoken
[1:38:34] word he gave us his word and we healed
[1:38:38] us hallelujah so if you are spiritually
[1:38:42] strong all the obstacle all the trials
[1:38:45] all the persecution the word in you will
[1:38:48] control your spirit and it will control
[1:38:50] your
[1:38:51] flesh that's why they said oh you're so
[1:38:54] poor you know but I still love the
[1:38:56] Lord because he
[1:38:59] promised in PM when David expressed
[1:39:02] himself to God he said H when I was
[1:39:06] young and now I am old right but I never
[1:39:11] seen the righteous forsaketh or begging
[1:39:16] bread God always supplies our needs
[1:39:19] according to the riches oh his glory we
[1:39:22] just need to uh seek his kingdom first
[1:39:26] if you are thirsting praise God if you
[1:39:28] are hungering let him be the first
[1:39:31] because he is trying to reveal himself
[1:39:33] to
[1:39:36] you are you happy amen then I weigh
[1:39:42] close I already bring my
[1:39:46] message
[1:39:47] Hallelujah and continue on with the last
[1:39:50] quote so if the musicians should
[1:39:52] come

[1:39:57] arrived amen we are now in the point of
[1:40:00] no return Hallelujah we see in the
[1:40:03] Horizon what is being in store for us I
[1:40:07] have prepared a place for you Hallelujah
[1:40:11] so let's keep moving on let's be
[1:40:13] inspired in spite of our trial and
[1:40:16] testing and persecution that's why
[1:40:18] satisfaction is better than success
[1:40:22] amen because success is based upon what
[1:40:24] anybody else tells you but satisfaction
[1:40:28] is within your soul right amen you may
[1:40:31] not have everything that this world
[1:40:33] offer but if you are satisfied you are
[1:40:37] blessed we have a roof above us we have
[1:40:41] a cloth to wear we have a foot on our
[1:40:43] table we have shoes for our feet what a
[1:40:46] blessed people we
[1:40:47] are that is the real life that is the
[1:40:50] real message of the hour not what
[1:40:53] somebody else dictate us on don't let us
[1:40:56] be molded by somebody else
[1:40:59] comments let us walk according to God's
[1:41:03] revelation in our heart don't care what
[1:41:05] anybody else says just like you know he
[1:41:08] don't care what anybody else says he
[1:41:10] don't care about anybody he just walk in
[1:41:13] the light as God is in the light until
[1:41:16] God translate
[1:41:18] him that is our status now they said it
[1:41:21] was in the days of
[1:41:24] Enoch the seventh from
[1:41:27] Adam we are now in the 7even churches
[1:41:30] amen and it
[1:41:32] will take effect in our generation
[1:41:36] that's right maybe this 2024 who
[1:41:39] knows just keep on moving amen
[1:41:43] hallelujah he the head is the first
[1:41:47] fruit of the Resurrection
[1:41:49] yes he is the first fruit of the rest is
[1:41:54] that
[1:41:55] right then what is he he's the head of
[1:41:59] the
[1:42:00] body which is his
[1:42:03] church the bride then the body bride
[1:42:06] must follow the head for it is part of
[1:42:10] his resurrection and part of the
[1:42:14] mystery listen to this it's impossible
[1:42:17] for it not to go in the first Direction
[1:42:20] he was the head so if the head is
[1:42:23] resurrected the body will follow amen
[1:42:27] hallelujah and he said it's impossible
[1:42:29] for it not to go Hallelujah the rupture
[1:42:32] is a sure promise because the first
[1:42:34] fruit is already being
[1:42:36] raised and we as the body of Jesus
[1:42:39] Christ will follow the head wherever the
[1:42:41] head the the the body follows oh my it's
[1:42:45] part of God's mystery how God revealed
[1:42:49] himself here
[1:42:51] and raise it up by the word and so he
[1:42:54] revealed the church and raised it up by
[1:42:58] the same word it's part of his threefold
[1:43:01] mystery Hallelujah that's why in Romans
[1:43:04] 8:11 but if the spirit of him that
[1:43:07] raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you
[1:43:11] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:43:14] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:43:18] his spirit that dwelleth in you amen the
[1:43:21] body must follow the
[1:43:24] head
[1:43:26] hallelujah it's
[1:43:28] impossible for him not to
[1:43:33] go and as the continue on in Christ The
[1:43:36] Mystery of God revealed as the head was
[1:43:38] sto from the grave so must the body
[1:43:41] follow him back to Eden where the head
[1:43:44] of the family the man the bridegroom the
[1:43:47] bride being the body of the bridegroom
[1:43:50] must must follow the bride because
[1:43:53] that's the head and the head's revealed
[1:43:56] and came back with eternal life
[1:44:00] Hallelujah I was once dead but now I'm
[1:44:04] alive amen because I live you shall live
[1:44:07] also Hallelujah and the body must follow
[1:44:11] that because it is husband and wife
[1:44:14] again just like it was in the beginning
[1:44:17] in the original creation God created
[1:44:19] Adam and Eve male and female
[1:44:22] Hallelujah but it was marred by unbelief
[1:44:27] but now praise God it is being restored
[1:44:30] back again in this generation praise the
[1:44:33] Lord it is H by wom and as long as
[1:44:35] you're pregnated with the same
[1:44:39] word which is his body you took his body
[1:44:43] because in him when you took the word
[1:44:46] not the qu the word make a text for this
[1:44:49] afternoon to go my wouldn't be wonderful
[1:44:52] see just think of it now what it is
[1:44:55] therefore the body cannot recognize
[1:44:58] don't you fail this don't you fail this
[1:45:01] he
[1:45:02] said the body therefore cannot recognize
[1:45:06] any other headship but the word that's
[1:45:09] right Hallelujah cuz the head is
[1:45:12] connected with the body and the head is
[1:45:16] the word and it's the same word one
[1:45:19] headship therefore denominations and
[1:45:22] holy fathers and everything else is dead
[1:45:25] is done it's nothing it cannot give you
[1:45:27] rapturing Faith it's done there's one
[1:45:30] headship and that's Christ and the body
[1:45:33] only recognize one thing Hallelujah the
[1:45:37] word as he is the word you are the word
[1:45:40] so let us that time together and I trust
[1:45:43] that it will challenge you it will
[1:45:46] revive you it will put in remembrance
[1:45:48] the things that we have already heard
[1:45:50] amen
[1:45:51] this is not a time to be weary this is
[1:45:53] not time to be sad this is a time to be
[1:45:56] Rejoice because the mystery of God what
[1:45:59] was in the back part of his mind before
[1:46:02] there was a stardust before there was a
[1:46:04] moon is now being
[1:46:06] revealed to his
[1:46:09] reent his bride that's the only one that
[1:46:14] he promised to reveal himself what a
[1:46:17] privilege people we are not even worthy
[1:46:20] that's right the grace of God but he do
[1:46:23] it anyhow Oh Praise hallelujah thank you
[1:46:27] Lord therefore denomination and holy
[1:46:30] fathers and everything is dead and done
[1:46:33] everything else is done for the Bride of
[1:46:35] Jesus there's one headship and that
[1:46:38] Christ and the body only recognize one
[1:46:42] thing the
[1:46:45] word that's why at the ending Paul said
[1:46:48] for we know in part and sign part but
[1:46:51] when that which is perfect is come the
[1:46:54] perfect interpretation of the word has
[1:46:57] come because God can do nothing except
[1:47:00] he reveal secret things to his Prophet
[1:47:03] that perfect interpretation of the word
[1:47:05] has come amen hallelujah then that which
[1:47:08] is in part shall be done away
