[25:56] evening greet you in the l l name of
[25:58] Jesus Christ so we have the final Trump
[26:02] that's probably coming into
[26:04] position you know listen some people are
[26:07] looking at that's the last great hope
[26:09] and everything let me there's only one
[26:11] hope that's in Jesus Christ I want you
[26:13] to know that you know different ones you
[26:15] know is this the Constantine that's
[26:18] going to come in or what you know who is
[26:21] this and what's what's going to happen
[26:22] listen last night last night you know
[26:25] Sandy and I stayed up until about 9:30
[26:27] they said you probably know who would be
[26:29] president by 10:00 so we were interested
[26:32] and at 9:00 or 10:00 they didn't know so
[26:35] I said I'm going to bed man we went to
[26:37] bed I said listen I'm not going to sit
[26:40] here and worry about it and this and
[26:42] that I said the right one will be there
[26:45] but I said listen that still doesn't
[26:47] stop the prophecy of the end time
[26:50] America has been weighed in the balance
[26:53] and found wanting America is in trouble
[26:57] and he said you can put at George
[26:59] Washington or Abraham Lincoln uh in
[27:02] office now in every office and you'll
[27:03] not turn her so I have a quote here I'd
[27:06] like to play If The Brothers you just
[27:08] raise your hand when you're when you're
[27:10] ready a little bit of what brother
[27:12] Brenham said and
[27:19] uh you let me know when you're
[27:22] ready and let's uh turn up the volume so
[27:25] they can hear it too
[27:31] somebody say praise the Lord praise the
[27:38] Lord notice but uh I'm not a politician
[27:42] I I want to be a Christian see and this
[27:43] not place for politics the whole thing's
[27:46] gone anyhow that way but this that we're
[27:48] talking about is eternal democrat or
[27:51] republican oh it's such a mess it can
[27:54] never be redeemed that's right it's over
[27:57] so don't argue about that the thing to
[27:59] do is live for this Kingdom for here we
[28:02] have no continuing City amen but we seek
[28:06] one to come amen that's right yes sir so
[28:12] politics is one side of the fence I'm on
[28:14] the other I said I I voted once that's
[28:16] for Christ I'm sure to win that's right
[28:20] see you got a vote coming see God voted
[28:23] for you the devil voted against you now
[28:25] which way you cast your votes where
[28:26] you're coming out
[28:28] so now I believe this person is just I'm
[28:31] going to think that it's just nervous if
[28:33] there's nothing condemning you go right
[28:34] on and just say get away from me Satan
[28:37] just move right on take the initiative
[28:39] thank and live for God thank you brother
[28:42] isn't that good brother renom just makes
[28:45] it so simple hey I've you know look uh
[28:49] God voted for me the devil voted against
[28:51] me now it depends on where you cast your
[28:53] vote now last night let me give you an
[28:56] example um we were uh we were here at
[29:00] the church about 6:00 I met Brother

[41:17] sir amen and we understand Psalm 110 is
[41:20] the prophecy of David concerning the
[41:22] coming Messiah amen so the Bible said
[41:25] from the first verse there says the Lord
[41:27] said unto my Lord sit thou at my right
[41:31] hand until I make thine enemies thy foot
[41:33] stol the Lord shall send the rod out of
[41:36] thy strength out of Zion and you know
[41:38] Zion's the
[41:40] bride amen rule thou in the midst of
[41:43] thine enemies thy people shall be
[41:45] willing in the day of the power in the
[41:47] beauties of Holiness from the womb of
[41:51] the
[41:52] morning I love the way the scripture
[41:54] puts that the womb of the morning you
[41:57] know we we we the benefici of a new
[42:01] day amen the rising of the
[42:04] sun amen the womb of the morning thou
[42:06] Hast the due of thy Youth and then verse
[42:09] four says the Lord hath
[42:12] sworn amen God ha sworn and will not
[42:15] repent thou art a priest Forever After
[42:18] the order of
[42:20] mesc amen and just think we'll leave it
[42:23] there and then just one more portion of
[42:24] scripture amen the book of Hebrews the
[42:27] ninth chapter and then you let you take
[42:30] the Comforts of your seat amen sorry to
[42:32] keep you
[42:34] standing just calming my
[42:37] nerves
[42:40] amen praise the
[42:43] Lord amen uh Hebrews the 9th chapter
[42:46] from verse one the Bible said then
[42:47] verily the first Covenant also
[42:50] ordinances of divine service and a
[42:52] worldly
[42:54] Sanctuary for there was a tabernacle
[42:56] made the first wherein was the
[42:58] Candlestick and the
[42:59] table uh and the shoe bread which is
[43:02] called the sanctuary and after the
[43:03] second Veil The Tabernacle which is
[43:05] called the holiest of all which had the
[43:07] golden sensor and the Ark of the
[43:09] Covenant overlaid round about with gold
[43:12] wherein was the golden pot that had the
[43:15] manor and aon's Rod that budded and the
[43:17] tables of the Covenant and over it the
[43:20] cherubims of Glory shadowing the mercy
[43:24] seed and notice what Paul says he says
[43:26] of which we cannot now speak
[43:29] particularly so there's something deeper
[43:32] there amen then verse 6 says now when
[43:35] these things were thus ordained the
[43:37] priest went always in the first
[43:39] Tabernacle accomplishing the service of
[43:41] God but in the second went the high
[43:43] priest alone and every year not without
[43:46] blood which he offered for himself and
[43:48] for the erors of the people the Holy
[43:50] Ghost this signifying that the way into
[43:53] the holiest of all was not yet manifest
[43:57] while as the first Tabernacle was yet
[44:00] standing amen but how many know that
[44:03] it's death to stay out of the holies of
[44:04] holies now because we've been ushered in
[44:07] by the holy
[44:08] spirit amen which was verse 9 says which
[44:11] was the figure for the time then present
[44:14] in which we were offered both gifts and
[44:16] sacrifices that could not make him that
[44:18] did the service perfect that's why there
[44:21] had to be a change of the
[44:23] order amen the iranic couldn't do it
[44:27] amen verse 10 said which stood only in
[44:30] meats and drinks and diverse Washings
[44:32] and carnal Court um ordinances imposed
[44:36] on them until their time of reformation
[44:39] but Christ
[44:40] amen come in and high priest of good
[44:44] things to come by a greater and more
[44:47] perfect Tabernacle not made with hands
[44:50] that is to say not of this building not
[44:53] physical neither by the blood of goats
[44:55] and Cales but by his own blood he
[44:58] entered in once into the holy Place
[45:01] having obtained Eternal Redemption for
[45:04] us can we say Amen praise the Lord for
[45:08] if the blood of bulls and goats and the
[45:10] ashes of an haer sprinkle sprinkling of
[45:13] the unclean Sanctified to the puring of
[45:15] the flesh purifying of the flesh verse
[45:17] 14 said how much more shall the blood of
[45:20] Christ whom through the eternal spirit
[45:23] offered himself without spot to God Amen
[45:27] Purge your conscience from dead Works to
[45:29] serve the Living
[45:30] God Amen may the Lord add a blessing to
[45:33] the reading of his word you may be
[45:36] seated
[45:39] amen praise His wonderful name I'm so
[45:42] grateful we have that high priest Christ
[45:44] Jesus amen that entered into the holies
[45:47] of holies once and for all amen once and
[45:50] for all this
[45:51] man forever made that Eternal sacrifice
[45:55] that us the worshiper will be purged
[45:57] from every trace of sin amen the Bible
[46:02] said he that is born of God cannot
[46:04] commit sin that's right brother brandham
[46:06] said you are The Virtuous spotless Blood
[46:10] Washed of the Living God Amen to him who
[46:14] who who is seated in Heavenly places
[46:16] there is now no condemnation for behold
[46:19] all things are made
[46:21] new by the womb of the morning rising of
[46:25] the sun amen that we've been Ben benici
[46:27] of in this
[46:29] day amen praise His wonderful
[46:32] name amen so so I just want to speak on
[46:35] this uh if the Lord would would help us
[46:37] and um I just want to just lay the
[46:41] foundation amen one quote brother random
[46:44] says amen um I actually didn't have the
[46:48] title there but I I believe it is in
[46:51] Mighty God
[46:53] unveiled brother random says um and when
[46:56] he come on Earth he was the Tree of Life
[46:59] do you believe
[47:01] that and Rome what did they do they he
[47:04] had he had to be chopped down and he was
[47:06] put on a tree of
[47:08] disgrace cursed is he that hang on a
[47:10] tree become a curse for the human race
[47:14] and now through that he brings forth a
[47:16] bride tree and listen to the prophet
[47:18] here striking statement it says which
[47:22] will be the Tree of Life rest restored
[47:25] back to him as husband and wife in the
[47:28] Garden of Eden by the same word and the
[47:31] same God made manifest in husband and
[47:33] wife the same bride tree back together
[47:37] again amen so it's beautiful um we
[47:41] understand there's this perfect Unity
[47:42] that is happening even
[47:44] now I know the flesh doesn't declare it
[47:47] because we still trapped in a body of
[47:49] time but brother brandom expressed it so
[47:51] clearly that we are creatures of
[47:54] Eternity amen this our our
[47:56] identification is not found in In the
[47:59] Flesh man amen but our identification is
[48:02] found in the inner man that which God
[48:04] purposed before the foundation of the
[48:06] world Amen that is who we are and what
[48:09] did the word do the word came our way to
[48:11] awaken the inner man to let us know who
[48:14] we are and I say thank God why because
[48:17] there's a Unity of between bride and
[48:19] bridegroom that is happening even now
[48:22] despite the way we feel
[48:26] sir amen doesn't matter how you feel
[48:29] what the flesh is saying still there is
[48:31] a Unity that happening between Christ
[48:33] and his
[48:34] bride why because the word declared
[48:38] it
[48:40] amen so so it's beautiful um so brother
[48:43] random begins to explain these things so
[48:45] clearly and and we understand um when
[48:48] when when when God spoke to Moses there
[48:51] um you see God was this um Myster you
[48:54] know when we when we when we think we
[48:56] have have things figured out with God we
[48:59] don't amen you know uh the more we think
[49:04] we understand the Bible the more we just
[49:06] left just bewildered because God God
[49:08] doesn't want to have us understand him
[49:10] in that way he's too
[49:13] big it's too magnificent for our little
[49:16] brains to think we understand you for as
[49:19] far as the East is the West so is my
[49:20] thoughts from you know the scriptures
[49:22] amen so we understand this is a a
[49:24] supernatural mysterious God always
[49:26] always been that
[49:28] way but God begin to explain and and and
[49:31] and begin to in a shadow that he that he
[49:34] paved out there in the Old Testament
[49:36] begin to express himself through
[49:38] Moses and he begin to give Moses a
[49:40] vision of what was in heaven and he
[49:42] begin to express to Moses Moses set up
[49:45] my Tabernacle on Earth and do this and
[49:48] that and you know how um create the the
[49:50] the the the the Tabernacle in such a way
[49:52] and and and and create the three courts
[49:55] and so forth why because
[49:57] God was beginning to in a
[50:00] measure introduce these Eternal thoughts
[50:02] to us in a measure beginning to express
[50:06] the Heavenly realm back on the
[50:09] Earth but you know brother random begins
[50:12] to express that this is a perfect Unity
[50:14] between the Eternal heavens and an
[50:16] Earthly
[50:17] bride this is the the union between a
[50:20] Heavenly bridegroom and an Earthly bride
[50:22] this is the marriage of Time and
[50:24] Eternity
[50:27] but when God begin to speak to Moses he
[50:29] had just expressed it in a little
[50:31] measure and I just want to go through
[50:34] these things if if if the Lord would um
[50:37] you know just um just to be quick but in
[50:41] the in the beginning there in the Garden
[50:42] of Eden you know um there's something as
[50:45] Paul said mysterious about these
[50:46] cherubims that I want to speak but I but
[50:49] this it's time fails us he says amen
[50:53] because there's more there than than
[50:55] what we realize
[50:57] eyes amen you understand we are such a
[51:00] blessed people because we we actually
[51:03] living in the
[51:06] climax can you believe it of the entire
[51:11] scriptures this people here today are
[51:13] beneficiaries of the
[51:16] Capstone
[51:17] Revelation that ends and restores
[51:20] Humanity back to eat
[51:25] again amen
[51:27] you know what the cross was was was was
[51:30] wonderful the blood sacrifice of
[51:33] God shed on Calvary the very blood of
[51:37] God flowed that we might have that
[51:39] sacrifice so that we can be ushed into
[51:41] his presence and then brother Brandon
[51:43] makes the statement and says um 78 years
[51:46] after the death of Christ he says when
[51:49] when John begin to see the lamb stepped
[51:51] forward to take the book in that in as
[51:53] it was caught up there brother brandom
[51:55] said if that never happened
[51:58] happened he said the whole of mankind
[52:01] would still be
[52:02] lost even after the
[52:08] cross amen why because we said what good
[52:12] is it if you pay if if we have a
[52:14] property if I have a property and I buy
[52:15] a property I put down the cost the price
[52:19] but if I don't have the title de I got
[52:21] nothing to
[52:22] prove but you see when the book opens
[52:26] down comes the mighty
[52:28] Angel unveils the word and something
[52:32] clicks on the
[52:35] inside that lets us know that we were in
[52:38] him before the foundation of the
[52:40] world what is that it's a claiming
[52:44] that's how you know you're part of
[52:47] him but that had to come by the breaking
[52:50] forth of the word of
[52:52] God so I say thank
[52:54] God for they without cannot even be made
[52:58] perfect they resting on
[53:01] us amen what a
[53:04] time what a Time the greatest time to
[53:08] live is this brother brandom said it why
[53:11] because it's the climax of
[53:14] humanity and I know it doesn't feel like
[53:18] it because we have trials and tests
[53:22] trapped in this body of Flesh waiting
[53:23] for the full
[53:25] Redemption take God at his word it's
[53:28] still the greatest time
[53:32] ever amen praise the Lord so if you have
[53:37] your Bibles um I know we had need to
[53:39] fire quick amen but just turn with me to
[53:41] Leviticus the 16
[53:44] chapter amen I just want to encourage
[53:46] you amen just let you know that the
[53:50] Bible speaks of
[53:53] you how many know we in we we in the the
[53:57] um the the the banquet of
[54:02] vashi but we not vashy we Esther because
[54:08] when our King our lover our bridegroom
[54:10] bids us come we
[54:12] come because there's something on the
[54:14] inside that makes us want to please him
[54:17] we love him this message is not a book
[54:20] of rules and dos and don'ts to the young
[54:22] people this is a love affair brother
[54:25] brandham said he said if I don't attend
[54:27] another church service I'm still
[54:30] saved to the elect of God God gave you
[54:33] re uh uh Salvation free free
[54:38] gift free but we come to this church to
[54:42] service because we want to show him how
[54:44] much we love him for what he's already
[54:46] done for us it's an expression of love
[54:49] that's what this message
[54:51] is amen praise His wonderful name so we
[54:55] in the bank with a
[54:58] because the Bible said how King King
[55:00] azerus he had this magnificent display
[55:03] of his his power and then at the end of
[55:07] those feasts he he arranges another
[55:09] seven
[55:10] days and then he begins to display his
[55:13] his magnificent power bringing out the
[55:16] the vessels of gold and just had all the
[55:19] kings around him to stand in O of The
[55:21] Magnificent King but you know on the
[55:24] seventh day
[55:27] the king and his advisers could not find
[55:30] any other thing greater than to bring
[55:32] out
[55:35] vashi nothing greater than God revealing
[55:39] his bride King azerus could find nothing
[55:43] greater on the seventh day than to bring
[55:45] out vashi and display her beauty to the
[55:48] world
[55:49] Hallelujah but you know vashi turned
[55:51] that
[55:53] down but thank God for Esther amen amen
[55:57] in the day of Esther the seventh
[56:00] month 10th um uh Esther in the the in
[56:05] the in the final Church age she will
[56:07] come
[56:09] forth and she won't let the king down
[56:12] because God puts something before the
[56:14] foundation of the world on the inside of
[56:16] her that would call her forth when he
[56:19] says come she
[56:21] comes amen praise the Lord
[56:24] so verse so so you know and and you know
[56:28] these types in the scripture is so
[56:29] beautiful even The Book of Leviticus
[56:31] that's why we understand you know never
[56:33] turn down the Old Testament it's
[56:36] beautiful because it's a shadow of what
[56:39] God cannot change you see brother Ram
[56:41] said he left it there in the types why
[56:43] because it's a shadow of what he will do
[56:45] and he cannot change and when God begins
[56:48] to deal with Israel he's dealing with
[56:50] the Gentile at the exact same time Amen
[56:53] in when when in in the in the banquet of
[56:55] Esther
[56:56] when Esther begins to reveal haymon's
[57:00] secret and we understand Esther had that
[57:02] secret that she was she was she was
[57:05] clothed in a gent under a gentile name
[57:07] but when she begins to display it was
[57:10] the uncovering of both the
[57:11] Gentile and the Jew and what would
[57:14] happen in the in the queen in in the
[57:16] banquet of Esther so God deals with the
[57:18] Gentile in the spiritual sense and
[57:20] Israel in a natural sense we know
[57:22] this amen so so if you look at the
[57:25] oldest in the Leviticus there just I
[57:27] just want to verse 16 from verse one
[57:31] amen as I speed up the Bible says and
[57:33] the Lord spake unto
[57:34] Moses after the death of the two sons of
[57:38] Aaron when they offered before the Lord
[57:40] and and and and and died and the Lord
[57:43] said unto Moses speak unto Aaron thy
[57:46] brother that he come not at all times
[57:49] into the holy place within the veil
[57:52] before the mercy seat which is upon the
[57:54] ark that he die
[57:58] not now this is a beautiful scripture
[58:00] verse one of the letter kth but the
[58:03] spirit giveth
[58:05] life because what God is saying there is
[58:08] unless I descend upon that Mercy seed is
[58:13] death amen that's why if you have the
[58:16] written word today it doesn't mean much
[58:19] there's a million churches that have the
[58:21] same
[58:23] Bible but it's only the bride that has
[58:25] the quickening of the spirit on the word
[58:29] to bring forth a
[58:32] life amen praise the Lord so you know I
[58:37] say in the message we shouldn't get too
[58:39] tied up with the semantics of the
[58:40] written word you have people arguing
[58:43] about what the prophet meant what he
[58:45] didn't mean what he meant to say and
[58:47] they and they and they begin to split
[58:48] hairs but you know what we don't we
[58:51] don't we don't look to the written word
[58:52] but we look to the quickening power of
[58:55] the Holy Spirit to bring the word to
[58:57] life cuz unless the shikina glory of God
[59:01] descended on The Mercy Seat it was still
[59:06] death why because we following the
[59:08] Living Word Amen brother brandom said if
[59:12] this Revelation doesn't produce the life
[59:15] of Jesus Christ he said we got the wrong
[59:18] Revelation it's a Living Word amongst
[59:20] the living people that prove that Christ
[59:22] is the same yesterday today and forever
[59:27] amen so um just to I just want to uh
[59:31] pick things up a little quicker so you
[59:33] know Aon begins to we have the two
[59:35] scapegoats and don't want to touch too
[59:37] much on that but maybe from verse
[59:40] 15 amen maybe from verse 14 the Bible
[59:44] says uh Leviticus 16:14 and he shall
[59:47] take of the blood of The Bu bulock and
[59:49] sprinkle it with his finger upon The
[59:51] Mercy Seat
[59:53] Eastward and before the mercy seat shall
[59:55] he sprinkle of the blood with his finger
[59:58] seven
[59:59] times amen and notice the scripture said
[1:00:03] Eastward because the same Jesus that
[1:00:05] rises in the East the same one that came
[1:00:07] in the west he's the lion of the tribe
[1:00:09] of Judah that comes out of the East so
[1:00:12] it had to be sprinkled to the east a
[1:00:14] signifying of the cleansing power of the
[1:00:16] great sacrifice
[1:00:18] mesc amen that would be the lamb the
[1:00:21] Eternal priesthood of God that would
[1:00:24] restore the people his people back into
[1:00:26] the holies of holies amen amen but
[1:00:28] listen to verse 15 says this then shall
[1:00:31] he kill the goat of the sin
[1:00:34] offering that is for the people and
[1:00:38] bring his blood within the
[1:00:41] veil and do with that blood as he did
[1:00:44] with the blood of the bulock and
[1:00:46] sprinkle it upon the mercy seed and
[1:00:48] before the mercy seed now listen to
[1:00:51] verse 16
[1:00:54] striking it says and he we shall make an
[1:00:59] atonement atonement at
[1:01:03] one for listen to this for the holy
[1:01:09] place isn't that
[1:01:11] striking the Bible said he had to make
[1:01:15] an atonement for the holy
[1:01:17] place because of the uncleanliness of
[1:01:20] the children of
[1:01:22] Israel notice the Bible's not saying he
[1:01:24] had to make an atonement for the the
[1:01:26] people but it's saying he had to make an
[1:01:28] atonement for the holy place because of
[1:01:31] the transgression of the people so in
[1:01:34] other words there's this beautiful um um
[1:01:37] um idea of the scriptures bringing forth
[1:01:39] that the holy place and the people had
[1:01:41] to be
[1:01:43] one they are intimately
[1:01:47] connected in other words the
[1:01:49] transgression of the people affect the
[1:01:51] holy place
[1:01:53] yes even so that that that he had to
[1:01:57] make an atonement for the holy
[1:02:00] Place amen isin't that beautiful amen
[1:02:04] because of the unclean uncleanliness of
[1:02:07] the children of Israel and because of
[1:02:09] the transgressions in all their sins and
[1:02:12] so shall he do for the Tabernacle of the
[1:02:15] congregation that remaineth am among
[1:02:17] them in the midst of the uncleanliness
[1:02:20] so this is an atonement for the holy
[1:02:24] Place why because there's got to be as
[1:02:27] brother brandom said that tree of life
[1:02:29] has to become the bride
[1:02:31] Tree in other words the holy place has
[1:02:34] to become the people amen know you not
[1:02:38] that ye are the Temple of the Holy
[1:02:40] Ghost In other words the holy Place
[1:02:43] cannot uh uh uh be uh perfect without
[1:02:48] the people being restored
[1:02:51] back amen the Bible said in verse 17 and
[1:02:55] there shall be no man in the Tabernacle
[1:02:57] of the congregation when he goeth and
[1:02:58] make an atonement in the Holy place
[1:03:00] until he come out and have an atonement
[1:03:02] for himself and for his household and
[1:03:04] for the congregation of Israel verse 20
[1:03:06] says this and when he hath made an end
[1:03:09] of reconcil look at this again and when
[1:03:12] he had made an end of reconciling the
[1:03:15] holy
[1:03:18] Place amen do you do you see that it's a
[1:03:21] Reconciliation of the Holy
[1:03:24] Place well when the high priest Aon went
[1:03:26] into the high priest what was he
[1:03:28] carrying on his
[1:03:30] shoulders the Bible said he had those
[1:03:32] onx those the stones of Onyx and he had
[1:03:35] those names of every tribe of Israel
[1:03:38] engraved in them in other words he was
[1:03:41] bearing upon his shoulders names elect
[1:03:44] as he went in a representation of people
[1:03:47] that always had to be in the holies of
[1:03:51] holies in fact the holies of the holies
[1:03:53] would become them and they would become
[1:03:55] the holies of holies for they would be
[1:03:57] the very Temple that God would now dwell
[1:04:00] in his
[1:04:02] bride so 20 says a reconciling of this
[1:04:06] holy place and the Tabernacle of the
[1:04:09] congregation and the Tabernacle of the
[1:04:12] congregation reconciling the holy place
[1:04:14] and the people
[1:04:17] together amen Praise Is Beautiful
[1:04:21] amen so um is this this working all
[1:04:25] right
[1:04:26] just want to go to the next slide
[1:04:29] sorry so so the Bible says there in in
[1:04:32] um and in Genesis it speaks of how um
[1:04:36] when when the fall had happened and Adam
[1:04:38] and Eve began you know they they were
[1:04:40] they God began to Usher them out of the
[1:04:41] Garden of Eden and the Bible said he put
[1:04:44] those
[1:04:45] cherubims guarding the way back to the
[1:04:47] tree of life and brother Bram said very
[1:04:50] explicitly he said the tree of life is
[1:04:51] the holiest of holies it's where the sh
[1:04:54] kind of Glory the very living word of
[1:04:56] God is made
[1:04:58] manifest so so as Adam and Eve uh uh
[1:05:02] they they through the fall God puts
[1:05:04] those cherubims but you know there's
[1:05:06] something mysterious about the cherubims
[1:05:08] because when you track the Journey of
[1:05:09] the cherubims you'll see it it comes
[1:05:12] back down to
[1:05:14] you amen and maybe we just fire quickly
[1:05:17] so so turn with me to eek do you mind me
[1:05:20] just leading a bit of scripture just to
[1:05:21] lay a foundation and we just uh hit it
[1:05:23] and then close amen so turn with me to
[1:05:25] Ezekiel the first um Ezekiel chapter
[1:05:30] 1 is going as the Lord leads
[1:05:40] amen so so there so so we see those
[1:05:43] cherubims they guard the way back to the
[1:05:45] tree of life but it seems as though
[1:05:49] those cherubs are just static in nature
[1:05:51] and you know we might have a a picture a
[1:05:53] mental picture of them just standing
[1:05:55] there
[1:05:56] with flaming swords guarding the way
[1:05:59] back to the tree of life but not so
[1:06:01] because in the in the shadow God begins
[1:06:03] to to to break forth upon Moses we see
[1:06:06] those cherubims over the
[1:06:09] ark amen over the ark so in other words
[1:06:12] we now know that wherever the word of
[1:06:15] God is those cherubims
[1:06:18] go so God displayed that to Moses he
[1:06:21] said Moses have those two cherubims with
[1:06:23] their wings tipped over The Mercy Seat
[1:06:25] which would
[1:06:26] the the the the the the the tables of
[1:06:28] stone as a protection just like it was
[1:06:31] in the Garden of
[1:06:33] Eden what's it doing protecting the
[1:06:36] manifested Living
[1:06:38] Word so now we see those those those you
[1:06:42] see those those uh staves of wood
[1:06:44] through those uh uh rings of gold that
[1:06:47] that the Levites would bear upon their
[1:06:49] shoulders as They Carried the word but
[1:06:50] wherever the word went those uh cherubs
[1:06:53] went
[1:06:55] so we're seeing those cherubims are not
[1:06:57] static but they're actually
[1:07:00] moving wherever the word is going
[1:07:02] they're moving so Ezekiel begins to pick
[1:07:05] up a different angle and take it deeper
[1:07:07] because remember this is this is God
[1:07:09] trying to reveal through the eons of
[1:07:13] time his very Eternal thoughts through a
[1:07:16] people every age was a people expressing
[1:07:19] an attribute of the mind of
[1:07:22] God so there Moses had a little shadow
[1:07:25] but Ezekiel brings something forth even
[1:07:27] deeper so turn with me quickly to
[1:07:29] Ezekiel chapter 1 amen still have like
[1:07:33] 30 30 minutes and then we start whining
[1:07:35] up amen is that right yeah um Ezekiel
[1:07:39] chapter 1 brother Ranch say give me a
[1:07:42] kick
[1:07:44] amen um Ezekiel chapter 1 so so he says
[1:07:49] um from verse
[1:07:51] four so now um e one of those prophets
[1:07:55] Daniel included that came out in the in
[1:07:58] the capture amen um in Babylonian times
[1:08:01] there so so he begins to express this in
[1:08:04] in in chapter 4 it says and I looked and
[1:08:06] behold a whirlwind came out of the North
[1:08:10] a great cloud and fire unfolding itself
[1:08:13] and brightness was about it and out of
[1:08:16] the midst thereof as the color of amber
[1:08:18] out of the midst of the fire also out of
[1:08:21] the midst thereof came the likeness of
[1:08:24] four living creatures so now we see it's
[1:08:27] it's it's not static like it was in
[1:08:29] Genesis but now we know that these
[1:08:34] cherubims over the Ark in the Tabernacle
[1:08:38] of Moses now actually have
[1:08:42] faces they have
[1:08:45] faces and mind you these would be the
[1:08:47] same faces that God would use throughout
[1:08:49] the seven Church ages to fight the
[1:08:53] devil so we understand now these
[1:08:55] cherubims actually have faces and
[1:08:58] Ezekiel uh begins to delve a bit deeper
[1:09:01] into the mystery of these cherubims as
[1:09:03] Paul said so let's continue he says uh
[1:09:05] verse 5 says and also out of the midst
[1:09:08] thereof came the likeness of four living
[1:09:10] creatures and this was their appearance
[1:09:13] look at this so four living
[1:09:15] creatures and this was their appearance
[1:09:18] they had the likeness of a man
[1:09:22] singular what are they doing they are
[1:09:25] going to
[1:09:26] these are are are representation of the
[1:09:28] fullness of the word of God they protect
[1:09:30] the ark the very word the essence Zoe
[1:09:33] the very life of
[1:09:37] God and we understand this is this is
[1:09:39] about a type of Jesus Christ but Jesus
[1:09:42] Christ was was brother randam said the
[1:09:44] three-fold purpose is to have the
[1:09:46] preeminence in Jesus Christ then to have
[1:09:48] the preeminence in the
[1:09:51] bride amen so we just we just another
[1:09:54] expr ex of the fullness of Christ in
[1:09:57] Pride form how many know that
[1:10:01] amen so so it says he had the likeness
[1:10:04] of a
[1:10:06] man let's go further and everyone had
[1:10:09] four faces everyone had four wings and
[1:10:12] their feet straight feet and The Souls
[1:10:14] of the feet was like the souls and
[1:10:16] there's so many symbols here you could
[1:10:17] take up months amen uh Sparkle the color
[1:10:21] of burnish bro and they had the hands
[1:10:24] and listen to this and they had had the
[1:10:25] hands of a man under their
[1:10:29] wings so when you behold these cherubims
[1:10:32] they look like a
[1:10:35] man keep that in the thought of your
[1:10:37] mind because when we close you'll see
[1:10:38] what I mean so they look like a man amen
[1:10:42] they had faces and their wings their
[1:10:44] wings were joined one to the other and
[1:10:48] uh turned not when they went they went
[1:10:50] everyone straight forward these these
[1:10:53] this being on on on on the left of a man
[1:10:56] but four faces can only go
[1:10:58] forth you say brother where do they go
[1:11:01] verse 10 says and as the likeness of
[1:11:02] their faces they for a face of a man and
[1:11:05] the face of a lion I'm just going
[1:11:07] speeding up if you don't mind on the
[1:11:09] right side uh they had the face of an ox
[1:11:12] and the face of an
[1:11:14] eagle amen so this is God's pattern
[1:11:17] doesn't change God established the the
[1:11:21] the tribes around Israel around the
[1:11:23] Tabernacle and everyone of of those
[1:11:25] tribes had a flag signifying the
[1:11:27] character lion eagle ox
[1:11:31] man so these cherubims Have
[1:11:35] Faces the same ones in the Garden of
[1:11:37] Eden the same ones that's following the
[1:11:40] ark the word they now have
[1:11:44] faces amen and then verse verse verse 12
[1:11:47] says and they went everyone straight
[1:11:50] forward wherever the spirit was to go so
[1:11:53] wherever the spirit of God goes they
[1:11:56] go well they that are LED of the spirit
[1:11:59] they are the sons of
[1:12:00] God if the spirit leads you then aren't
[1:12:03] they
[1:12:06] going amen verse 13 says as the likeness
[1:12:11] and and this is um just notice this
[1:12:13] verse 13 um just just give me your
[1:12:15] attention amen I know I'm firing very
[1:12:17] quick and I apologize amen verse 13 says
[1:12:21] as the likeness of the living creatures
[1:12:23] they appearance I want you to notice a
[1:12:25] few things in verse
[1:12:27] 13 it says and the appearance was like
[1:12:30] burning coals of fire that's the first
[1:12:32] thing so when he's beholding these these
[1:12:35] four beasts that that have uh the
[1:12:38] appearance of a man he notice he notices
[1:12:40] burning coals of
[1:12:42] fire and then he notices the appearance
[1:12:44] of
[1:12:46] lamps amen and then he
[1:12:49] notices um uh uh it says uh and the the
[1:12:53] fire was bright and out of the fire went
[1:12:55] forth lightning so he's
[1:12:58] noticing burning coals of fire lamps and
[1:13:04] lightning
[1:13:05] amen praise the Lord I'm just trying to
[1:13:09] see um and and notice um from verse 16
[1:13:12] it says when he's beholding these
[1:13:14] creatures they look like they're
[1:13:16] traveling on
[1:13:17] Wheels so again there it's not static
[1:13:20] like in the Garden of Eden but these
[1:13:22] cherubims are moving like we seen with
[1:13:24] the ark they moving where the ark goes
[1:13:26] and not only there but they moving
[1:13:28] wherever the spirit of God goes they
[1:13:32] move that's why when when Ezekiel
[1:13:35] beholds them they look like they on
[1:13:38] Wheels amen now turn with me quickly to
[1:13:42] um just keep your finger on Ezekiel
[1:13:45] firing quickly amen we need the spirit
[1:13:47] of God Among Us just to keep us on the
[1:13:49] same page here amen turn with me to
[1:13:52] Revelations the 4th chapter
[1:13:56] you say brother what are you trying to
[1:13:57] do what are you trying to say I'm trying
[1:13:59] to let you know and we'll see what
[1:14:01] brother brandom said it said those
[1:14:04] living creatures is a representation of
[1:14:10] you you see you can trace your origin
[1:14:14] all the way back to
[1:14:16] Genesis that's a brother bam said the
[1:14:19] tree of life and the bride tree is the
[1:14:21] same thing amen
[1:14:25] why because inside you dwells
[1:14:30] deity and if deity dwells in you then
[1:14:33] those cherubims must be around
[1:14:37] you that's why they can be nothing
[1:14:39] defeat
[1:14:41] you they couldn't defeat God Christ
[1:14:44] through the seven Church ages how can
[1:14:46] the devil cap capture you even now with
[1:14:49] the random said they couldn't even get
[1:14:50] you in your unsafe State the devil how
[1:14:53] much more your safe state
[1:14:55] because of the eternal security of the
[1:14:58] elect seed of God nothing can befall
[1:15:04] you amen so remember we we said Ezekiel
[1:15:09] chapter 1 ver3 he said he seen those
[1:15:11] coals so maybe if I could just go back
[1:15:14] there I just want to get this mental
[1:15:15] picture so the old Tabernacle
[1:15:19] right going from east to west and again
[1:15:22] God doesn't make mistakes
[1:15:25] the same Sun that rises in the East sets
[1:15:27] in the
[1:15:28] west why did brother brandham have to go
[1:15:30] west because the holies of holies lays
[1:15:32] in
[1:15:33] the
[1:15:35] west brother random said when the gospel
[1:15:37] Goes West he said he can't go any
[1:15:39] further it got to go back East that's
[1:15:42] why the same message we receive like
[1:15:44] Queen Esther unveils the plan for the
[1:15:46] Gentiles and the Jews at the same
[1:15:49] time the same message goes back to the
[1:15:51] Jews under those two prophets same
[1:15:54] message message to reveal the atonement
[1:15:57] a Reconciliation of the Holy place and
[1:15:59] the people of
[1:16:03] God Amen Revelations the fourth chapter
[1:16:06] turn with
[1:16:08] me so now this Revelations chapter 4 is
[1:16:12] really even a clearer picture of what
[1:16:15] Ezekiel
[1:16:18] see clearer picture in the Bible say
[1:16:20] verse one says after this I looked and
[1:16:23] behold the door was opened to heaven
[1:16:26] and the first voice which I heard was as
[1:16:27] it were a trumpet talking with me said
[1:16:30] come up hither and I will show thee
[1:16:32] things to come that's why Saints we
[1:16:34] cannot be in Leo
[1:16:38] deia amen the the Jacob's Ladder
[1:16:43] connects
[1:16:45] Heaven and
[1:16:47] Earth Heaven and the bride of
[1:16:50] Christ Heaven and the body of Christ
[1:16:53] Jacob's Latter cannot connect you to Le
[1:16:55] deer because the Bible said angels of he
[1:16:58] of of God sent up and down bringing
[1:17:00] spiritual Revelation to you and I so in
[1:17:03] other words for you to to be caught up
[1:17:05] in the promises of God you cannot be
[1:17:09] Earthbound don't let your jobs and and
[1:17:12] what you do and around this connal way
[1:17:14] of life Trap you on WE Heavenly beings
[1:17:19] made to S the glory of God
[1:17:25] amen so come up
[1:17:27] here that's the call why because there's
[1:17:30] a door in heaven open God wants to show
[1:17:33] you just how special you are but how can
[1:17:36] he if we
[1:17:40] Earthbound amen praise the Lord says
[1:17:44] verse two and immediately I was in the
[1:17:45] spirit and and in the spirit so if
[1:17:50] you're in the spirit then those those
[1:17:51] cherubims must be following because it
[1:17:53] said wherever the spirit goes they they
[1:17:57] go you see there if you are in the
[1:18:00] spirit if you're being led of the spirit
[1:18:02] of God those cherubims must be with
[1:18:08] you amen said uh I was in heaven and
[1:18:12] there was a a throne was set in heaven
[1:18:14] and one sat on the throne and he that
[1:18:16] sat was to look on like a Jasper and saw
[1:18:18] a s and stone and there was a rainbow
[1:18:21] around about them around about the
[1:18:24] throne in sight like unto an emerald and
[1:18:27] round about The Throne were four living
[1:18:31] for four and 20 seats and upon those
[1:18:33] seats I Saw 4 and 20 elders and you know
[1:18:35] brother random said those Elders those
[1:18:37] were the 12
[1:18:38] Patriarchs and the 12
[1:18:41] disciples what what are they doing they
[1:18:43] there to testify that the same
[1:18:46] Jesus same God in Genesis is the same
[1:18:50] Jesus that comes forth and takes the
[1:18:52] book these are the witness that God
[1:18:55] cannot change and has not changed he's
[1:18:57] the same the same Angel of the Covenant
[1:19:01] that led them out in the first Exodus
[1:19:03] it's the same one we seen on the
[1:19:07] side these Elders are a witness that
[1:19:10] it's the same
[1:19:12] God same
[1:19:14] God Amen and upon the seats I Saw 4 and
[1:19:18] 20 ERS sitting clothed in white rayen
[1:19:20] and they had on the heads crowns of gold
[1:19:23] and out of the throne proceeded
[1:19:26] Lightnings and thunderings and voices
[1:19:29] and there you see remember um uh Ezekiel
[1:19:33] 1113 those
[1:19:37] lamps Ezekiel just seen them as
[1:19:40] lamps didn't Express much in Ezekiel
[1:19:43] 1113 but in five we now know those lamps
[1:19:47] there's seven of
[1:19:51] them and it says which are the seven
[1:19:53] spirits of God
[1:19:57] do you see this
[1:19:59] eternal uh uh unfailing of way God
[1:20:03] expresses his words in symbolic form but
[1:20:06] now in
[1:20:07] reality brother Ram said what's God
[1:20:09] trying to do is trying to have us have
[1:20:11] confidence in the word to know that he
[1:20:14] cannot change if God would would keep
[1:20:16] the written word so
[1:20:19] pure how can he fail with promises
[1:20:22] regarding us
[1:20:24] that should give us confidence in God
[1:20:26] and his word to know that the promises
[1:20:29] of God cannot fail and will not fail
[1:20:34] amen amen
[1:20:37] hallelujah praise the Lord amen so uh
[1:20:41] just keep your finger
[1:20:43] again on Revelations 4 sorry and then go
[1:20:46] back to Ezekiel chapter 1 don't have
[1:20:49] much time amen so
[1:20:53] um so
[1:20:55] yeah so um if you notice if you turn
[1:20:57] with me to Ezekiel uh the first chapter
[1:21:00] still just from to verse 2 to 22 Ezekiel
[1:21:06] 1:22 the Bible said and the likeness of
[1:21:09] the firmament upon the heads of the
[1:21:11] living creature was as color of terrible
[1:21:14] Crystal stretched forth over their heads
[1:21:16] above and under the firmament were their
[1:21:18] wings straight the one toward the other
[1:21:22] everyone had two which covered on the
[1:21:25] side and everyone two which covered on
[1:21:28] that side their bodies and listen to
[1:21:30] verse 24 said and when they went I heard
[1:21:32] the noise of their wings like the noise
[1:21:35] of Great
[1:21:36] Waters what did Brother random said
[1:21:38] water
[1:21:39] signifies
[1:21:42] people remember in Revelations 4
[1:21:45] thunderings
[1:21:47] Lightnings
[1:21:49] voices so now we know these cherubims
[1:21:52] where they where they when they when
[1:21:54] they flap their wings they make the
[1:21:56] sound of
[1:22:00] people amen is it coming
[1:22:03] home amen praise the Lord
[1:22:07] hallelujah now and so so you remember
[1:22:11] Ezekiel 1:13 we said uh those coals of
[1:22:14] fire um notice so what ezekiel's really
[1:22:18] seeing if we go back to the um yeah what
[1:22:22] Ezekiel is really seeing is is is is
[1:22:26] this because he said those those those
[1:22:28] cherubims he said they they had they had
[1:22:31] um the
[1:22:32] lamps going up and down before them he
[1:22:35] said they had coals burning coals and
[1:22:38] you notice that's the that what he's
[1:22:40] seeing is the altar of incense there
[1:22:42] because that's where the high priest
[1:22:43] would take the coals of the altar of
[1:22:46] incense and take it into the holies to
[1:22:48] make that that incense fill the holies
[1:22:51] of holies as a sweet Aroma to Christ to
[1:22:54] God
[1:22:55] right and then it says Lightnings and
[1:22:58] when they mooved they moved like
[1:23:00] lightning Ezekiel
[1:23:02] 113 what did Matthew 25 24
[1:23:06] say the son of man as the lightning
[1:23:08] shineth from the
[1:23:10] East to the West so will the son the
[1:23:14] return of the son of man be Matthew
[1:23:17] 24 amen so you're seeing this this
[1:23:20] perfect you see this message you know
[1:23:22] this message is the gospel truth
[1:23:27] amen you know sometimes we we use the
[1:23:29] term message in in in a way that that
[1:23:32] that confuses us because we we make it
[1:23:34] look like it's something outside of the
[1:23:36] Bible this is not a movement this is the
[1:23:39] in the beginning God now revealing
[1:23:42] himself hasn't changed the message is
[1:23:45] the reality of who God
[1:23:47] is this is the ongoing testimony of
[1:23:51] Jesus Christ which is the spirit of
[1:23:53] Prophecy the Bible says
[1:23:55] amen amen so don't look at this message
[1:23:58] young people as a book of rules if dos
[1:24:00] and don'ts a movement this is the gospel
[1:24:02] of God it's only one this is the
[1:24:06] truth amen that's what I'm trying to
[1:24:09] show amen amen so brother random brother
[1:24:13] random basically he makes uh you know uh
[1:24:16] maybe sorry back
[1:24:18] there I think the brothers at the back
[1:24:21] are going to kick me out and fire me
[1:24:22] pretty soon
[1:24:26] um yeah so Ezekiel 1 turn I'm we closing
[1:24:31] Ezekiel 1 126 just uh verse 26 turn with
[1:24:35] me again 26 Ezekiel 1
[1:24:37] 126 the Bible says and above the
[1:24:39] firmament that was over their heads was
[1:24:42] a likeness of a throne as the appearance
[1:24:45] of a sapphire stone and upon the
[1:24:47] likeness of the throne was a likeness as
[1:24:50] the appearance of a man above it above
[1:24:53] upon it and I saw as the color of amber
[1:24:56] as the appearance of fire round about
[1:24:58] within it from the appearance of his
[1:25:00] loins even upward and for the appearance
[1:25:02] of his loins even downward and I saw as
[1:25:05] it were the appearance of fire and it
[1:25:06] had brightness roundabout verse 28 as
[1:25:09] the appearance of the bow that is in a
[1:25:11] cloud in the day of
[1:25:14] rain now you know brother random said
[1:25:17] this
[1:25:18] picture is an exact expression of
[1:25:21] Ezekiel 1
[1:25:22] 12627 amen
[1:25:26] you see that's why you know we should
[1:25:28] not develop uh denominational pictures
[1:25:31] in our head of angels fluttering and you
[1:25:34] know physical images of an eagle and a
[1:25:37] beast they they just symbols that
[1:25:39] represent things God wants to bring to
[1:25:42] us in reality
[1:25:44] form so so brother random said Ezekiel
[1:25:47] and we'll see the quote this is a
[1:25:49] representation of Ezekiel 26-28 but you
[1:25:51] don't physically see the the
[1:25:55] lion the ox the eagle there do
[1:25:59] you you don't physically see it but yet
[1:26:01] brother Bram said it is
[1:26:04] yes amen because what is it it's not a
[1:26:07] carnal understanding of of this the
[1:26:10] symbols in that way but it's an
[1:26:11] expression of the power of God
[1:26:14] protecting the
[1:26:17] believer because the word of God is
[1:26:19] veiled in The
[1:26:20] Believer and wherever the believer goes
[1:26:23] the spirit of God goes go and wherever
[1:26:25] the spirit of God goes the believer goes
[1:26:28] therefore those beings must be there as
[1:26:30] the power God sends the
[1:26:34] church and I mean we could break down
[1:26:36] those you know but these beasts have
[1:26:39] have have have have symbols and they
[1:26:41] have ways and and powers that they that
[1:26:43] they that they protect us by right amen
[1:26:47] so this brother brandom said is an
[1:26:48] expression of Ezekiel
[1:26:52] 1:26 closing you know brother Ram says
[1:26:55] this he says I want you to remember God
[1:26:58] still exists in the same
[1:27:00] colors he said from the loins upward
[1:27:04] from the amber color this is in the
[1:27:06] Hebrews the Hebrew series four he says I
[1:27:09] want you to remember God will exist in
[1:27:11] the same colors from the loins upwards
[1:27:14] uh fire amber color shot with a movie
[1:27:16] camera or with a color camera Amber from
[1:27:19] the loins up from the loins down and all
[1:27:22] around many colors like is in the
[1:27:24] rainbow in the sky after
[1:27:27] rain it says Jesus Christ the same
[1:27:30] yesterday today and forever the Holy
[1:27:32] Spirit still in his power still in his
[1:27:36] church in the last day there you are
[1:27:39] amen not me I was just standing there
[1:27:43] but it was a picture that was taken I
[1:27:44] want you to look same way and flush the
[1:27:47] same way of the living creatures what is
[1:27:50] it question mark brother random said the
[1:27:53] living creatures represent presentent
[1:27:54] The Living
[1:27:56] Church amen the church that's living by
[1:27:59] the power and the resurrection of Jesus
[1:28:04] Christ amen so we understand the the
[1:28:08] Bible the Bible said and it was a a
[1:28:12] rainbow there where these these these
[1:28:14] beasts that when when they were
[1:28:15] expressed it was like a rainbow
[1:28:17] according to Ezekiel 128 like a rainbow
[1:28:20] so the rainbow is the Angel of the
[1:28:22] Covenant which is Jesus Christ the
[1:28:23] promise that that cannot
[1:28:26] fail well I seen another Mighty
[1:28:30] Angel amen Revelations 10 come down one
[1:28:34] foot upon the Earth One upon the sea one
[1:28:37] upon the Earth and he cried with a loud
[1:28:39] voice amen and it had a rainbow over his
[1:28:42] head the Bible said what is it the same
[1:28:44] Jesus what is he doing expressing
[1:28:46] himself in bright
[1:28:48] form expressing himself in Bride form
[1:28:51] that bride would be the expression of
[1:28:53] the power of those beasts in the Living
[1:28:55] Church to prove that they are now the
[1:28:57] temple of
[1:29:01] God Amen I'm closing amen one more
[1:29:06] scripture Revelations chapter 5
[1:29:24] verse 5
[1:29:26] says
[1:29:28] amen maybe from verse three says and no
[1:29:30] man in heaven knowing the Earth neither
[1:29:32] under the Earth was able to open the
[1:29:34] book neither to look thereon and I wept
[1:29:37] much because no man was found worthy to
[1:29:39] open and to read the book NE neither to
[1:29:41] look thereon and one of the elders
[1:29:43] sayith unto me weep not below the line
[1:29:46] of the tribe of Judah see that's why it
[1:29:49] had to be sprinkled to the east on The
[1:29:51] Mercy Seat because this is the same
[1:29:53] Jesus that that come out of Judah the
[1:29:55] East yes but what's he doing brother
[1:29:58] brandom said he's taking that hickey
[1:30:00] through seven Church ages going
[1:30:03] west you know brother random said in in
[1:30:06] in the breach he said um he said what's
[1:30:09] what's he's expressing uh this this
[1:30:11] Revelations chapter 5 and he said what's
[1:30:13] Jesus doing he said he's coming for the
[1:30:15] Jews how many know that
[1:30:17] scripture brother Ram's not making a
[1:30:21] mistake because we said when he reveals
[1:30:24] himself to the Gentiles he's doing the
[1:30:26] same to the Jews he's working on both
[1:30:28] sides at the same time one in spiritual
[1:30:30] one in natural
[1:30:32] form so as he's coming to reveal himself
[1:30:35] but what's he doing is in his in his
[1:30:37] descent is's finding a bride a gentile
[1:30:40] bride through seven Church
[1:30:42] ages and then when he snatches her away
[1:30:45] he goes back to his people because when
[1:30:46] we go far east the gospel cannot go any
[1:30:49] further but go west east go east again
[1:30:52] we've gone west as far far as we could
[1:30:56] go what to do to preserve the type the
[1:31:00] high priest would come out of the East
[1:31:01] and go
[1:31:03] west as he was sprinkling the blood
[1:31:06] going into the holies of holies but the
[1:31:08] high priest could not go any further
[1:31:10] west he had to come back out the same
[1:31:14] way through the Eastern Gate again and
[1:31:17] declare the reconciliation and the
[1:31:19] congregation of of Israel and the holy
[1:31:22] place to the people amen
[1:31:26] what's this thinging it's bringing the
[1:31:27] atonement to a gentile and a Jewish
[1:31:31] people we've received ours and they will
[1:31:34] receive
[1:31:36] theirs amen oh Saints you know it's we
[1:31:39] so blessed the same message we had
[1:31:41] revealed both the light to the Gentile
[1:31:44] and what should happen for the
[1:31:48] Jews amen what a blessed people we are
[1:31:51] we're not stumbling in darkness but our
[1:31:52] eyes is wide open
[1:31:55] spiritually thank you Lord amen so he
[1:31:58] says and I wept much because no man was
[1:32:00] found worthy to open to read the book
[1:32:02] neither to look thereon thank God and
[1:32:04] one of the elders said weep not Behold
[1:32:06] The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[1:32:08] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[1:32:11] and to loose the Seven Seals
[1:32:14] thereof and I beheld in low in the midst
[1:32:17] of the throne and of the four
[1:32:20] beasts now I want you to notice who's
[1:32:22] around the throne just read it with me
[1:32:25] says and I behold and loow in the midst
[1:32:27] of the throne and the four beasts and in
[1:32:29] the midst of the of the elders stood a
[1:32:31] lamb so there's only the four and 20
[1:32:34] elders and the
[1:32:35] beasts
[1:32:37] right and the lamb stood a lamb as it
[1:32:41] had been slain having seven horns and
[1:32:43] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:32:44] of God sent forth into all the Earth and
[1:32:47] he came and took the book out of the
[1:32:50] right hand that sat upon the throne and
[1:32:52] when he had taken the book The listen to
[1:32:54] this when he had taken the book The Four
[1:32:57] beasts and the four and 20 Elders fell
[1:33:00] down before the
[1:33:02] lamb so who's falling down who's
[1:33:05] represented around the throne there it's
[1:33:07] just the four and 20 elders and the four
[1:33:10] beasts
[1:33:12] right but look what he said having every
[1:33:15] one of them Harps and golden vials full
[1:33:17] of the oders which are the prayers of
[1:33:18] the Saints so now we know there's you
[1:33:21] represented there too
[1:33:26] amen you see
[1:33:28] that and then the Bible said verse 9 and
[1:33:31] they
[1:33:33] sung and you
[1:33:35] sng what we just seen it's just the 4
[1:33:38] and 20 elders and the beasts and the
[1:33:41] prayers of the
[1:33:44] Saints so but they
[1:33:46] sung this is This Is Us in Angelic form
[1:33:50] around the throne worshiping God
[1:33:52] represented by the powers in the
[1:33:57] church amen so brother random said those
[1:34:01] Beast represent the
[1:34:03] church that's living in the power of the
[1:34:06] resurrection of
[1:34:08] Christ and they sung a new
[1:34:12] song
[1:34:14] Amen do you see that this evening
[1:34:17] Saints these are your repres these
[1:34:20] beasts represent you clothed in the
[1:34:23] power of the the church that God sends
[1:34:24] the church clothed in that power you're
[1:34:28] there and then brother brandom said well
[1:34:30] these had they couldn't be Angels
[1:34:33] because they said thou has redeemed
[1:34:39] us so if the Beast were and the 4 and20
[1:34:42] ERS were around the throne worshiping
[1:34:44] God why did they say we were you
[1:34:47] redeemed
[1:34:51] us maybe let's let's say and they sung a
[1:34:54] new song Thou Art Worthy to take the
[1:34:56] book and to open the seals thereof for
[1:34:58] thou was slain and H has redeemed us to
[1:35:01] God by the blood out of every Kindred
[1:35:04] tongue and people and
[1:35:08] Nations amen praise the Lord what is
[1:35:13] that the Church of the Living
[1:35:15] God Amen the very Temple of the Holy
[1:35:18] Ghost the very the very fullness of God
[1:35:21] that's now dwelling in his bright in his
[1:35:23] bride poured out of Christ into the
[1:35:25] church and there those Powers represent
[1:35:29] her that where she is they are where the
[1:35:32] spirit of God is they
[1:35:35] are therefore I say to you Saints what
[1:35:38] can separate you from the love of
[1:35:40] God what trial what test what situation
[1:35:43] when God so proved in his word that you
[1:35:46] went all the way from
[1:35:48] Genesis and you found in
[1:35:50] Revelations where the spirit and the
[1:35:52] bride say come
[1:35:57] this Bible speaks of
[1:35:59] you amen the message speaks of you this
[1:36:02] is Christ revealing himself though in
[1:36:06] symbolic form there but here we sitting
[1:36:08] in Christ Jesus expressing the very
[1:36:10] reality of what God had in his mind I
[1:36:13] say thank you
[1:36:15] Lord amen let's stand our feet praise
[1:36:17] the
[1:36:18] Lord
[1:36:21] amen prise the Lord
[1:36:25] gracious Heavenly Father Lord I Lord
[1:36:28] just time just and I just Lord just
[1:36:30] maybe a broken up sermon father but I
[1:36:33] just pray that the Holy Spirit would
[1:36:34] just take the words Lord and just form
[1:36:37] the picture god of what You' have us see
[1:36:39] father that Lord your bride is traced
[1:36:43] her Origins goes all the way back before
[1:36:45] the foundation of the world father the
[1:36:48] Garden of Eden Lord and she she she
[1:36:51] followed that great Blood Trail Lord all
[1:36:53] the way way to the Cross father right to
[1:36:56] the expressing of the word Lord that
[1:36:58] would call them by name father brother
[1:37:01] brandom said it's not or man Neville not
[1:37:03] Lil not an audible name but the mystery
[1:37:07] of the word calls her forth father and
[1:37:09] Lord though they don't understand it or
[1:37:11] might not be able to theologically
[1:37:13] explain it but something deep down says
[1:37:15] Lord I am there I was there and I say
[1:37:20] God in times of our trials and tests
[1:37:22] Lord may we remember the power Lord that
[1:37:25] you sent the
[1:37:27] church God I know we don't feel like it
[1:37:29] at times Lord because Lord we twofold
[1:37:32] beings father straddling Time and
[1:37:35] Eternity Lord and we have issues Lord
[1:37:39] unsaved family and Lord just chaos and
[1:37:43] and turmoil sometimes Lord and it
[1:37:45] sometimes feels like we're not even
[1:37:47] saved but that's a lie Lord when we look
[1:37:51] into the mirror of your word we see our
[1:37:53] origin all the way back to the end the
[1:37:55] beginning
[1:37:56] father and in moments of Trials and
[1:37:58] tests Lord may we remember that Lord as
[1:38:01] unchanging and as un unfailing as you
[1:38:04] are Lord we are too you cannot fail and
[1:38:07] we cannot fail Lord bless your people
[1:38:10] father I pray that you just give them a
[1:38:12] special anointing Lord in an hour as
[1:38:15] deceptive as this
[1:38:17] Lord God we see Israel Lord a little
[1:38:21] Drop in the Ocean Lord surrounded by the
[1:38:23] enemies being bombarded from all angles
[1:38:26] Lord but we understand that's a type
[1:38:28] maybe of what's happening in the
[1:38:30] spiritual to your bride
[1:38:32] father but Lord we will have the victory
[1:38:34] father CU you promised it and Lord you
[1:38:37] cannot fail Lord Jesus we say thank you
[1:38:40] Lord we love and appreciate you we ask
