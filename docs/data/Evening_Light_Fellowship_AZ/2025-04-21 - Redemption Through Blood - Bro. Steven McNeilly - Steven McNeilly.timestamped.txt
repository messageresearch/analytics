[38:50] you this morning. It's certainly good to
[38:52] be in the house of the Lord. And we just
[38:55] want to wish you all a very happy
[38:58] resurrection day. Happy Easter from our
[39:01] family to yours and uh to think what he
[39:05] has done for us. Amen. Amen. Let's pray
[39:10] together. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[39:13] approach thee this
[39:15] morning by the new and living way by the
[39:19] precious blood of Jesus Christ that was
[39:21] shed for us on Calvary. No longer do we
[39:25] have to come by the the way of bulls and
[39:28] goats that that just covered sin, but
[39:31] now we can come into thy presence, Lord,
[39:34] as a sinless people because of the
[39:37] finished work. And so I ask, Lord, that
[39:40] you would come by this morning and that
[39:42] you would take the word and and break it
[39:45] open to us, Lord, and perhaps put us in
[39:48] remembrance, Father, of the great things
[39:50] that you have accomplished for us and
[39:53] done for us as your children. Now we
[39:56] commit this service into your hands for
[39:58] thy kingdom's glory. In the name of
[40:00] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen and amen.
[40:04] Amen. God bless you. Thank you so much,
[40:06] musicians. And uh if you have your
[40:09] Bibles, turn with me to the book of
[40:10] Isaiah, chapter
[40:13] 53. And uh we bring you greetings from
[40:16] brother Ron there in South Africa. And
[40:19] uh he said to greet the people. They're
[40:21] having a wonderful time. And uh God did
[40:24] something very special there for the
[40:26] young people. He did a he took a young
[40:28] person's meeting, a youth meeting, and
[40:31] uh pretty much every single one
[40:33] rededicated or gave their life to
[40:35] Christ. And so we just see the fruit of
[40:37] the ministry there. And uh I believe we
[40:39] have some pictures there, brethren. If
[40:41] we could show them. Um everybody
[40:44] remember we had prayer for for brother
[40:47] uh there's an oldie right
[40:49] here. Look at that. I couldn't help
[40:52] myself. We had to put that one up there.
[40:54] Go on to the next
[40:55] one. This is brother uh Ruben Daniels.
[40:59] Remember we had prayer for brother
[41:00] Ruben. He was in a a coma, induced coma
[41:04] there for a while and stuff. And now
[41:06] he's out. He's doing well. You can see
[41:07] he finished his breakfast and his orange
[41:10] juice. The next
[41:13] picture. And there's brother. I'm not
[41:15] sure who this brother is, but Brother
[41:18] Joe Daniels. Okay. Praise the Lord.
[41:20] Yeah. So, praise the Lord. He's doing
[41:23] good. His health is good. He's preaching
[41:25] good. And so, that makes us all happy
[41:28] here at home. So Isaiah 53, we'll read
[41:31] verses
[41:32] 1-2. And the Bible says, "Who hath
[41:35] believed a report? And to whom is the
[41:38] arm of the Lord revealed? For he shall
[41:40] grow up before him as a tender plant and
[41:43] as a root out of a dry ground. He hath
[41:45] no form nor calmliness. And when we
[41:47] shall see him, there is no beauty that
[41:50] we should desire him. He is despised and
[41:53] rejected of man, a man of
[41:55] sorrows, acquainted with grief, and we
[41:59] hid, as it were, our faces from
[42:01] him. He was despised, and we esteemed
[42:04] him not. Surely he hath borne our
[42:07] griefs, and carried our sorrows. Yet we
[42:11] did esteem him stricken, smitten of God,
[42:14] and afflicted. But he was wounded for
[42:17] our transgressions.
[42:19] He was bruised for our iniquities. The
[42:21] chastisement of our peace was upon him,
[42:24] and with his stripes we are healed.
[42:26] Thank you, Lord. All we like sheep have
[42:29] gone astray. We have turned everyone to
[42:32] his own way. And the Lord hath laid on
[42:34] him the iniquity of us all.
[42:39] He was
[42:40] oppressed. He was
[42:42] afflicted. Yet he opened not his mouth.
[42:46] He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[42:48] and as a sheep before her shears is
[42:50] dumb. So he opened not his mouth. He was
[42:54] taken from prison and from judgment. And
[42:56] who shall declare his generation? For he
[42:59] was cut off of the land of the living
[43:01] for the transgression of my people was
[43:04] he stricken? And he made his grave with
[43:07] the wicked and with the rich in his
[43:10] death. Because he had done no violence.
[43:13] Neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet
[43:15] it pleased the Lord to bruise him. He
[43:18] hath put him to grief. And when thou
[43:20] shalt make his soul an offering for sin,
[43:23] he shall see his seed. He shall prolong
[43:26] his days, and the pleasure of the Lord
[43:28] shall prosper in his hand. He shall see
[43:31] of the travail of his soul, and shall be
[43:33] satisfied. By his knowledge shall my
[43:36] righteous servant justify many.
[43:39] Hallelujah. For he shall bear their
[43:41] iniquities. Thank you, Lord. Therefore
[43:44] will I divide him a portion with the
[43:46] great and he shall divide the spoil with
[43:49] the strong because he hath poured out
[43:51] his soul unto death. He was numbered
[43:52] with the transgressors and he bare the
[43:55] sin of many and made intercession for
[43:59] the transgressors. Hallelujah. You may
[44:02] take your seat this morning.
[44:05] We'll trust that the Lord will add the
[44:07] blessing to the reading of his word. I
[44:09] would like to title my sermon this
[44:11] morning redemption through blood.
[44:16] I'd like to start off our service this
[44:18] morning there in the book of Genesis.
[44:20] And we can see uh that is the first
[44:23] place where redemption took place. And
[44:26] we know that God made the heavens and he
[44:28] made the earth and he made the sun and
[44:31] he made the moon and the galaxies and
[44:33] natures and the trees and vegetation and
[44:36] and and and all of this. creation and
[44:39] and and he did it God didn't do it just
[44:42] for the sake of creating something. But
[44:45] God was doing it because he was
[44:47] beginning to unfold a great plan. He was
[44:50] beginning to unfold the thoughts that he
[44:53] had in his mind since the foundations of
[44:56] the world. So when God does something,
[44:58] we know he does it with a purpose. And
[45:01] that makes us happy and glad as
[45:02] Christians because we know whether it's
[45:04] good or bad or whether we have ups or
[45:07] whether we have downs, we know that God
[45:09] is working in our lives for a purpose.
[45:14] And so we see now that God be through
[45:17] nature was beginning to reveal himself
[45:20] and he was beginning to unfold this
[45:23] great plan of redemption that he had in
[45:25] his mind. Romans 1:20 says, "For the
[45:29] invisible things of him from the
[45:31] creation of the world are clearly seen."
[45:34] Notice, "The invisible things are
[45:36] clearly seen, being understood by the
[45:39] things which are made, even his eternal
[45:41] power and godhead, so that they are
[45:44] without excuse." So now God takes things
[45:48] that are visible, things that are
[45:50] tangible, things that can be seen and
[45:52] tasted and and and felt and heard, and
[45:55] he and he takes those visible things and
[45:58] he makes known the invisible or he makes
[46:01] known the supernatural by the things
[46:04] which are. Amen. Right? So, we can take
[46:08] a look at a tree and we can look at a
[46:10] flower and and we can we can realize
[46:12] that a seed that is planted in the
[46:15] ground is going to bring forth of its
[46:17] kind. If we plant the sunflower seed in
[46:21] the ground, Baniah came home the other
[46:23] day from school with this little pot and
[46:25] um and uh and and and it just looked
[46:28] like dirt on the it's just dirt. And
[46:30] unless you knew what was this, there was
[46:33] something planted inside this dirt. You
[46:35] would think it's just dirt. Well,
[46:37] yesterday all of a sudden, man, this
[46:39] little thing, there was two little
[46:40] shoots all of a sudden sprung up. Well,
[46:43] he was really impatient and he's looking
[46:46] at that thing and he's saying, "I need
[46:48] to put it in the sun and I need to add a
[46:50] little bit of water to it." And he is
[46:51] right. For in order for a seed to come
[46:54] forth, it's got to be in the presence of
[46:56] the sun. It's got to have the water of
[46:58] the Holy Spirit in order for it to bring
[47:00] forth. And so now he's getting very
[47:02] impatient and he's looking at it and I'm
[47:04] son just be patient. And all of a sudden
[47:07] this little thing is starting to spring
[47:09] forth. What is it? It's life that's
[47:11] coming forth. You may not see the life
[47:14] coming forth when you want to, but just
[47:16] be patient in God cuz God knows what
[47:19] he's doing.
[47:20] Praise the Lord. So now we can take we
[47:22] can look at a seed and we realize a seed
[47:25] brings forth after its kind. We can look
[47:27] at the same tree and look at the same
[47:29] flower and we can see the death, burial
[47:32] and resurrection within the scriptures.
[47:34] We can look at the stars and we can say
[47:36] wow look at these the magnificent stars.
[47:39] But yet when you look with inspiration
[47:42] you can see God's Bible. Why? Because
[47:45] God has made the visible things that we
[47:48] may understand the invisible.
[47:52] But too much of the time we we we can
[47:55] get super hypers spiritual and we can
[47:58] say, "Wow, uh you know what I'm going to
[48:00] do? I'm going to study the
[48:02] stars and I'm going to study the
[48:04] galaxies and I'm going to study the
[48:06] black holes and I'm going to study this
[48:08] and because God is known by by nature
[48:10] and and his first Bible was written in
[48:12] the heavens and all of a sudden
[48:14] especially those of you who are
[48:17] extremely intellectual. I don't have
[48:20] this problem. Believe me, if you were to
[48:23] see my grades in school, you would
[48:25] understand.
[48:26] And so we can uh uh ex uh intellectual
[48:31] people, they look and they say, "Wow,
[48:33] well, if I could just figure the
[48:34] galaxies out and if I could just figure
[48:37] the moon out and how all of these things
[48:39] work, I'll be able to understand God."
[48:42] But God is understood by faith.
[48:46] And so God is revealed in simplicity. So
[48:50] instead of trying to figure everything
[48:53] out and trying to understand all of
[48:55] these natural things, you ought to just
[48:57] stay with the scripture, uh, he told
[49:00] Abraham, "Look at the stars. Can you
[49:02] number
[49:03] them?" No, I can't number the stars.
[49:06] Well, so shall your seed be. Look at the
[49:08] grain and the sand. Can you number them?
[49:10] No, I I can't number them, Lord. Well,
[49:12] that's how much that's what your seed
[49:15] is. That's the the the amount that your
[49:16] seed is going to be. Instead of trying
[49:18] to figure out and count all the grains
[49:20] of sand and the stars in the sky, how
[49:23] about we just say, "You know what?
[49:24] Abraham has a lot of seed."
[49:28] Just God revealing himself in simplicity
[49:31] and take the words of a prophet. When he
[49:34] says that the Zodiac is God's first
[49:36] Bible, he starts off with with the
[49:38] virgin and ends up with Leo the lion.
[49:40] Hey, that's good enough for me. I don't
[49:43] need to try and figure out all the
[49:45] inbetweens. I just need to stay what the
[49:47] what a prophet said in this
[49:49] day. God reveals himself in
[49:54] simplicity. And the more intellectual
[49:56] that we get trying to figure out God's
[49:58] word, the further we get away from the
[50:01] presence of God because God is not known
[50:04] by reasoning or the knowledge of man,
[50:06] but God is known by simple faith.
[50:11] Hallelujah. This is why Eve fell in and
[50:15] and seduction of the serpent because she
[50:17] choose reasoning over faith in God's
[50:20] word. And sometimes it's just good to
[50:22] say, I believe the word of God. I don't
[50:26] need to try to figure all the ins and
[50:28] outs. I just believe God's word. Amen.
[50:32] But because of her reasoning and her
[50:34] intellects of her
[50:37] humanity, it got her off track. So,
[50:40] Brother Brandham said this. He said,
[50:41] "Adam was not deceived, but Eve was
[50:45] deceived, but Adam knew exactly what
[50:48] what he was doing." Hear ye him
[50:51] 1957. You can notice I'm trying to go
[50:53] fast because I have I have a lot of I
[50:56] have a lot to car to go through here
[50:59] today. So, you help me. You pull on the
[51:01] word, you help me preach, we'll get
[51:03] through it. And if the Lord wants me to
[51:04] leave my notes, I'll leave them. I'm
[51:06] happy to do that. We just want the will
[51:08] of the Lord to be done this morning.
[51:10] Paragraph 24. God here was going to do
[51:13] something that he'd asked man to do. Um,
[51:16] and God will never ask you to do
[51:19] anything that he would not do himself.
[51:22] Did you ever think of that? Did you ever
[51:24] go back in the Garden of Eden in the
[51:26] great coming forth of Adam and Eve? The
[51:28] Bible said that Adam was not deceived.
[51:31] Adam was not deceived. He knowed exactly
[51:33] what he was doing. But because of the
[51:36] love that he had for Eve, he walked
[51:38] right out into death with her. Not
[51:40] because he had to. He no different. Eve
[51:43] was absolutely deceived. She thought she
[51:45] was right. But Adam knowed better. He
[51:47] walked out with her and took death with
[51:49] her. Was was a great sign that the
[51:52] church, the bride, was guilty. Christ
[51:55] was not guilty, but he become guilty to
[51:57] die. The death for the church to redeem
[52:00] her. He went to death with her.
[52:03] Hallelujah. We talk about the bride and
[52:05] we talk about about about the bride of
[52:08] Jesus Christ. But guess what? Within
[52:10] ourselves, we are guilty. Within
[52:12] ourselves, we would choose the wrong
[52:14] way. But God rich in mercy. Hallelujah.
[52:17] He died for us at Calvary,
[52:20] knowing better, knowing what he was
[52:23] doing, knowing what would be the the
[52:26] pain that was set before him. Yet, he
[52:28] laid it all aside. Why? Because he had
[52:30] somebody in his mind. Amen. Thank you,
[52:33] Lord. So God now was showing through
[52:35] Adam and Eve this plan of redemption and
[52:38] how that one could be wrong and
[52:39] deserving of death. Yet there would be
[52:41] one who would be innocent would take the
[52:44] place of the guilty.
[52:47] One who knew no sin. One who did nothing
[52:49] wrong. Have you ever been punished for
[52:51] something that you never did?
[52:54] I have.
[52:56] And it wasn't good. And you know what?
[52:59] When you're a
[53:01] troublemaker, you're your trouble. Yeah.
[53:03] Trouble's always following that person.
[53:05] So, it's got to be them.
[53:08] And because you're a troublemaker, you
[53:10] know, not to tattletail on other people.
[53:15] It wasn't me. It was so and
[53:17] so. No, you just keep your mouth shut
[53:21] and you take it. It's not nice, though.
[53:25] You're innocent.
[53:27] It wasn't me. You ever had a sibling
[53:30] rivalry? I fought with my cousins. I
[53:32] have no siblings. Huh? And and there's
[53:36] always the one sibling that's super
[53:38] smart and hits the other one. And if
[53:40] they don't make a noise, they hit them
[53:42] harder. And they hit them harder until
[53:44] they try to get them to to to make a
[53:46] noise and get mom and dad mad. I told
[53:48] you to stop it. It wasn't me. Well, you
[53:51] screamed. Huh? Get in trouble. Yeah,
[53:56] sibling
[53:57] rivalry. It's a good thing. A lot of
[53:59] times we have sibling rivalry within the
[54:01] church, don't we? Huh? Some of you
[54:04] siblings always fighting and getting on
[54:06] with one another, saying something and
[54:08] poking and proddding and huh, hey, let's
[54:10] leave the sibly sibling rivalry to the
[54:13] side cuz it doesn't make papa happy.
[54:16] Amen. Okay, so moving on. So God was
[54:19] showing through Adam and Eve that that
[54:21] that that uh that there would be that
[54:23] there would be an innocent one would
[54:24] take the place of the guilty and the
[54:27] plan of redemption. Now God would begin
[54:29] to unfold his plan in in in shadows and
[54:33] types and symbols through the lives of
[54:35] people.
[54:37] So we see that God would show through
[54:39] Abraham that not only would he have a
[54:42] royal seed, but he would all or would he
[54:44] have a natural seed, but he would also
[54:46] have a royal seed. And that royal seed
[54:49] would be a very peculiar people. I would
[54:52] say we are very peculiar people to the
[54:54] world, aren't we? Sometimes we're not
[54:56] only peculiar to one another, but we're
[54:58] peculiar to ourselves. Right?
[55:02] Sometimes, you know, it it's hard for
[55:05] people to figure you out when you can't
[55:07] figure yourself out.
[55:10] But we see then through the life of
[55:12] Isaac, we realize that uh God would use
[55:15] now the life of Isaac and and Isaac
[55:18] would be that promised son and and he
[55:20] would be a type of Christ where he would
[55:22] take his wood, carry his wood up the
[55:24] hill to uh for to be his own sacrifice.
[55:28] He was a type of Christ. We could see
[55:30] that uh that Christ would be uh made
[55:33] known through the life of Joseph and how
[55:35] Joseph would be sold for 30 pieces of
[55:38] silver and and he would be thrown into a
[55:40] dungeon and and and and there would be
[55:43] the baker and this other guy and one
[55:45] would be saved and one would be killed
[55:47] just like Christ on the cross. one would
[55:49] be saved and and uh uh and and and be
[55:52] with him in eternity and the other one,
[55:54] you know, would would spend his his uh
[55:57] uh I wouldn't say eternal days because
[56:00] we know hell is not eternal, but he
[56:02] would spend however long it is those
[56:04] days in that place called hell. You
[56:07] know, hell is a real place.
[56:10] We talk about heaven so much, but we
[56:12] never talk about hell. Understand?
[56:14] without being born again. There's only
[56:17] one place to go after this life. It's
[56:19] either heaven or hell. And if you're not
[56:22] born again, we're going to hell. I
[56:25] realized that one time that I was a good
[56:27] for nothing rotten sinner. But that God
[56:30] had gave his life for me and shed his
[56:32] blood that I would not go to hell, but I
[56:35] would go to that place called heaven.
[56:37] Hallelujah. He did the same for you, my
[56:39] brother and my sister. You just got to
[56:41] accept the gift that God has given for
[56:45] us. Amen. So we see that Joseph then
[56:49] would be in a dungeon and then all of a
[56:51] sudden he would be risen up to the right
[56:53] hand of Pharaoh just like Christ after
[56:55] he his resurrection. Now he sits at the
[56:58] right hand of the father with full
[57:00] authority and full power. Amen. We could
[57:03] look at uh we could look at Moses and we
[57:06] could see that how God used Moses and
[57:08] Moses would portray the life of Christ
[57:11] and and that that God would use Moses
[57:13] really a a one-man army and he would
[57:16] bring the children of Israel out of
[57:18] Egypt and as he was before he would
[57:20] bring them out of Egypt, he would say,
[57:22] "Uh, you've got to slay a lamb."
[57:24] Hallelujah. the very first Passover. If
[57:28] the lamb is not slain for every
[57:30] household, if the blood is not applied,
[57:32] the death angel will not pass over. But
[57:35] if you'll do what I say, if we'll just
[57:38] take the words of a prophet and we'll
[57:40] apply it to our lives, understand the
[57:42] death angel will not only pass over us,
[57:45] but he'll pass over our families, over
[57:48] our children, and over our loved ones.
[57:50] That's why it's so important for us to
[57:53] live such a godly life that when our
[57:56] children see our testimony and they see
[57:58] our lives that they want what we have.
[58:00] Amen. Exactly.
[58:03] But you've got to come under the blood.
[58:06] If you're not under the blood, there's
[58:08] no safety. But under the blood, under
[58:10] the token life of God is safety for the
[58:14] believers.
[58:18] So he had to apply the blood. God would
[58:20] now reveal himself in the life of David.
[58:23] And down through the many characters of
[58:25] the Bible, he would prophesy of a
[58:28] Messiah who would come and redeem Israel
[58:30] out of his
[58:31] bondage until
[58:34] finally finally, you understand this
[58:37] this scripture that we read in Isaiah
[58:39] 53, it it wasn't written after the
[58:42] crucifixion of Christ.
[58:45] Realize it was before. It was hundreds
[58:48] of years before. And yet it was a man
[58:50] anointed of God. And he would speak
[58:53] prophetic words. And these prophetic
[58:55] words would, brother Brandham said, they
[58:57] would circle the earth until finally
[59:00] they found the right ground in order to
[59:03] come to pass in the right ground of a
[59:05] person's heart. And so everything we
[59:08] read there, whenever you read Isa Isaiah
[59:11] and you read the new the New Testament
[59:13] on the crucifixion of Christ, you think,
[59:16] "Wow, was he there?" It's actually
[59:20] worded. The verbiage is actually worded
[59:22] like it already come to pass. My back
[59:26] they have stricken. My back they have
[59:28] whipped. And by my stripes you are
[59:30] healed. And and it's already written in
[59:33] such a way that it's already come to
[59:35] pass. When God says something, it is as
[59:38] good as done. Even if it hasn't come to
[59:41] pass yet. And so if God spoke that
[59:43] California is going to sink, understand
[59:46] California is going to sink. But if God
[59:48] if brother Brandham spoke of a rapture,
[59:51] understand that also that a rapture is
[59:53] going to happen.
[59:56] We just got to be patient and stay in
[59:59] the presence of God.
[1:00:04] So finally,
[1:00:06] hundreds of years later, sometimes maybe
[1:00:09] it was a thousand or more, these words,
[1:00:13] these prophecies that were spoken many,
[1:00:16] many, many prophecies, speaking of the
[1:00:18] Lord's crucifixion, speaking of the
[1:00:20] coming of the Messiah, and everybody was
[1:00:23] looking for it. Have you ever have you
[1:00:26] ever waited on somebody before? And
[1:00:28] you're looking and you're waiting and
[1:00:32] you're
[1:00:32] waiting. You get kind of tired of
[1:00:34] waiting, don't you? Well, where are
[1:00:37] they? They're supposed to be here 20
[1:00:40] minutes ago.
[1:00:42] Miles, he was he went to Aunt Bee's and
[1:00:46] Uncle Nick's the other day. And uh and
[1:00:49] and anyways, he he he got to spend a
[1:00:51] little time with them. And um so it was,
[1:00:55] you know, Uncle Nick said, "Yeah, I'll
[1:00:57] be there such and such a time." Yep, I'm
[1:00:59] going to be there. Sorry, Uncle
[1:01:01] Nick. Not throwing you under the bus,
[1:01:04] but it goes with the story.
[1:01:07] So supposed to be there at a certain
[1:01:09] time and and and we ate dinner and and
[1:01:12] Miles is all, "Is Uncle is Uncle Nick
[1:01:14] here yet?" And you know, sometimes it's
[1:01:17] hard not to be sarcastic.
[1:01:20] uh doesn't look like he's here
[1:01:23] yet. You
[1:01:25] know, when he's here, you're going to
[1:01:28] know he's
[1:01:29] here because you're going to go with
[1:01:31] them.
[1:01:32] Yes, sir. Oh, hallelujah. If you can
[1:01:36] read between the lines, he was watching
[1:01:38] and he was waiting and he was asking and
[1:01:40] asking. But when Uncle Nick finally
[1:01:42] came, when the Lord finally comes,
[1:01:46] you'll go with him. If you're watching
[1:01:47] and waiting, we just got to be prepared
[1:01:50] and watch and wait that when he comes as
[1:01:53] a thief in the night, brother Mario,
[1:01:56] we'll be watching. We'll be waiting and
[1:01:58] we'll go with him.
[1:02:00] Praise the Lord. But sometimes it gets
[1:02:02] tiring waiting.
[1:02:04] I want to tell you, be patient.
[1:02:07] He's coming.
[1:02:09] Be patient. Your healing is coming. Be
[1:02:13] patient. Amen. The answer of your
[1:02:15] prayers are coming. Be patient. The
[1:02:19] answer is on its way. Thank you, Lord.
[1:02:22] Finally, Isaiah 7:14 was fulfilled.
[1:02:26] Therefore, the Lord himself shall give
[1:02:27] you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall
[1:02:30] conceive and bear a son, shall call his
[1:02:33] name Emanuel. Isaiah 9:es 6-7. For unto
[1:02:37] us a child is born, unto us a son is
[1:02:39] given. The government shall be upon his
[1:02:41] shoulder, and his name shall be called
[1:02:43] wonderful counselor, the mighty God, the
[1:02:46] everlasting father, the prince of peace.
[1:02:48] Of the increase of his government, and
[1:02:50] peace there shall be no end. The peace
[1:02:55] of God which passes all understanding,
[1:02:58] there is no end to it. That's right.
[1:03:00] Amen.
[1:03:03] He said to uh to order it and to
[1:03:05] establish it with judgment and with
[1:03:07] justice from henceforth even forever.
[1:03:09] The zeal of the Lord of hosts will
[1:03:12] perform this. So now we see that through
[1:03:15] the ages God would reveal himself.
[1:03:18] Notice this in part through
[1:03:22] man. Until the time of Adam and Eve,
[1:03:26] until the time of of Jesus coming in his
[1:03:29] physical form, in the fulfillment of the
[1:03:31] prophecies, God would reveal himself in
[1:03:34] part, right? Just a little bit. In
[1:03:38] Ireland, we see just a wee bit. A wee
[1:03:40] bit here and a wee bit there. A wee bit
[1:03:44] through Moses and a wee bit through
[1:03:46] David. A wee bit through this one and a
[1:03:48] wee bit through that one. But until
[1:03:50] finally there was one who would come and
[1:03:53] it would be Emmanuel. His name was Jesus
[1:03:57] Christ. He's the wonderful, the
[1:03:58] counselor, the prince of peace, the
[1:04:01] mighty father, all of these titles. But
[1:04:03] his name was Jesus Christ. Finally, he
[1:04:06] would come and fulfill the scriptures.
[1:04:09] And now God would reveal himself in his
[1:04:13] entirety. It was no longer a wee bit
[1:04:16] here and a wee bit there. But now God
[1:04:19] would make himself known in his
[1:04:22] completeness
[1:04:24] through the man called Christ Jesus.
[1:04:29] Colossians 2:es 8-9 says, "Beware lest
[1:04:32] any man spoil you through philosophy and
[1:04:34] vain deceit after the tradition of men,
[1:04:37] after the rudiments of the world, and
[1:04:38] not after Christ. For in him dwelleth
[1:04:42] all the fullness of the godhead bodily.
[1:04:47] So it was no longer a wee bit here and a
[1:04:49] wee bit there. But now Christ come
[1:04:52] according to the prophecy fulfilling the
[1:04:54] word and the prophecies of the Old
[1:04:56] Testament. And now God would begin to
[1:04:59] reveal his entire plan of redemption
[1:05:04] through one man. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:05:07] Questions and answers 1964. Brother
[1:05:09] Brandham says now that pillar of fire is
[1:05:12] the lugos that went out of God. The
[1:05:14] lugos which is actually the attribute of
[1:05:16] the fullness of God when God become into
[1:05:20] a form to where it could be seen. It was
[1:05:22] the anointing of the great spirit that
[1:05:24] went forth. It's condescending coming
[1:05:27] down God the father the logos that was
[1:05:31] up over Israel. He was holy could not
[1:05:34] bear sin. There had to be a blood
[1:05:37] offering right in Eden. Then that logos
[1:05:40] became flesh and dwelt among us. And
[1:05:43] where this logos dwelt in a human body,
[1:05:45] which was the sacrifice, when man was
[1:05:48] made in the image of God, and then God
[1:05:50] come down in the image of man to redeem
[1:05:53] man, that brought God that brought man
[1:05:56] and God together. So what is it that
[1:05:58] brings God and man together? It was when
[1:06:01] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:06:05] us and died to death, it brought man and
[1:06:08] God together. Understand? When the word
[1:06:11] is made flesh and the hour and the age
[1:06:15] in which you live in, it is a connection
[1:06:18] between man and God. It is a connection.
[1:06:22] It's what brings man and God together.
[1:06:25] It's the blood for the age. the message
[1:06:27] of the age, not a message of another
[1:06:29] day, but for the day in which you live.
[1:06:32] So, it's more than just sermons. It's
[1:06:35] more than just words and paragraphs and
[1:06:37] quotes. It's actually a connection. What
[1:06:40] the message does, it it connects man and
[1:06:43] God together for a relationship.
[1:06:47] Amen. Hallelujah. That's why we don't
[1:06:50] have just the message of Luther. That
[1:06:52] was for Luther's day. It took them so
[1:06:54] far. We can go on to Wesley. We can go
[1:06:56] on to Pentecost, but the message of this
[1:06:59] day has brought a closer connection with
[1:07:03] God and his people to where they're at a
[1:07:05] point where they are one
[1:07:08] where now she becomes him. What is it
[1:07:11] that makes her him? It's the connection
[1:07:14] of the revealed word of this day. Amen.
[1:07:18] Praise. So don't read it like it's just
[1:07:22] a quotation. Don't read it just like
[1:07:24] it's a a a a a sermon or a book. No,
[1:07:28] read it like saying, "Wow, I feel a
[1:07:31] connection. I feel something that's
[1:07:33] pulling me towards God." Don't just read
[1:07:36] it for the sake of reading it, but read
[1:07:38] it with a revelation that that that
[1:07:41] you're being pulled into a higher
[1:07:42] kingdom.
[1:07:46] A oneness,
[1:07:48] with God. Yes. That's right.
[1:07:52] You know, until you get married, you
[1:07:55] never un fully understand the scripture
[1:07:58] that these two shall be
[1:08:00] one. But once you get married, there's a
[1:08:02] scripture that begins to unfold. And now
[1:08:05] you understand that these two flesh are
[1:08:08] joined together and they're one flesh.
[1:08:12] That's what this message has done.
[1:08:15] It has joined together
[1:08:18] the bride of this age in Jesus Christ.
[1:08:21] And it is an invisible union. Amen. Oh,
[1:08:25] hallelujah. It's the word that is
[1:08:27] drawing us into a union with our Christ
[1:08:31] and our God. Amen.
[1:08:36] So he says, "And then God came down in
[1:08:38] image of man to redeem man that brought
[1:08:40] man and God together. Heavens and earth
[1:08:43] hugged and kissed each other." Isn't
[1:08:45] that beautiful? God and man embraced
[1:08:48] each other as fatherhood and sunship.
[1:08:50] When the lugos became flesh and dwelt
[1:08:53] among us, Jesus said, "I came from God
[1:08:56] and I go to God." Is that right? After
[1:08:58] his death, burial, resurrection, and
[1:09:00] ascension, when the body was taken up
[1:09:02] and set at the right hand of God, he
[1:09:04] says, "I don't mean uh God got a right
[1:09:06] hand, God's a spirit, but at the right
[1:09:08] hand means in power and authority of
[1:09:11] God." That in that name, everything in
[1:09:13] heaven is named after it and subject to
[1:09:16] it. Everything in earth is named after
[1:09:19] it and subject to it. Understand that's
[1:09:22] good and bad. That's you and that's
[1:09:24] evil. I want to tell you an evil spirit
[1:09:27] that's bothering you is subject to the
[1:09:30] name of Jesus Christ. You just got to
[1:09:33] use it in faith. In knowing that it's a
[1:09:36] name above all names and it can be used
[1:09:39] for your benefit.
[1:09:41] Thank you, Lord. That's right.
[1:09:43] Everything in everything in earth is
[1:09:45] named after it and subject to it. A name
[1:09:47] above all names, Jesus Christ. Now this
[1:09:50] logos that was in him which was the
[1:09:53] spirit of God, the anointing through the
[1:09:55] sanctifying grace of the blood brought
[1:09:58] many sons to God which is anointed with
[1:10:02] this same
[1:10:05] logos. Wow.
[1:10:08] So the logos that was
[1:10:11] God that was made flesh amongst us is
[1:10:14] the same logos now that dwells is the
[1:10:18] same logos that is anointing many sons
[1:10:21] and daughters of God. Amen.
[1:10:25] Man, this Zoey life of God, this Holy
[1:10:29] Ghost baptism, it ain't nothing to
[1:10:32] nothing to kid about, man. It ain't
[1:10:34] nothing to put off, but it's so vitally
[1:10:37] important because that's what seals us
[1:10:40] until the day of our redemption. That's
[1:10:42] what reveals to us the word of God is
[1:10:44] the Holy Ghost, the very Zoey life, the
[1:10:47] logos of God himself.
[1:10:54] So God now came down in the image of man
[1:10:56] to redeem man because man fell in the
[1:10:59] flesh. We understand that mortal man
[1:11:01] could die for one another, but none was
[1:11:03] able to take away the sins of our fellow
[1:11:07] countrymen. So we see now in order for
[1:11:09] for for God now to take away the sins of
[1:11:13] the earth, he had to come in the body of
[1:11:15] flesh himself because man was not
[1:11:18] worthy. There was nobody worthy because
[1:11:21] we are all born in sin. Our lives are
[1:11:24] shaped in iniquity. We can help each
[1:11:27] other in certain ways that we can, but
[1:11:29] we can never give each other uh uh uh
[1:11:33] salvation. Our blood, if I was to shed
[1:11:36] my blood for you, it would be a a nice
[1:11:38] thing. It would be a nice thing to do.
[1:11:41] And you might be remembered as a
[1:11:43] hero, but my blood is not good enough to
[1:11:46] take away the sin in your life.
[1:11:49] And so God now had to become flesh
[1:11:51] because man died in the flesh himself.
[1:11:55] He came that he might partake of
[1:11:58] sickness. He came that he might be a
[1:12:00] partaker of a of a headache and and and
[1:12:03] be a partaker of being alone and being a
[1:12:06] partaker of of of being rejected and and
[1:12:09] all these different things that we go
[1:12:11] through in life. Why did he do it?
[1:12:13] because he was going to be a mediator at
[1:12:15] one point and he needs to be a high
[1:12:18] priest who can be touched by the
[1:12:20] feelings of our infirmities.
[1:12:23] And so he brought So now God brought
[1:12:26] Jesus Christ through these things for
[1:12:28] our benefits. Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[1:12:31] Because he knows how you feel and he
[1:12:34] knows what you're going through. And he
[1:12:37] knows how to intercede. Why? Because
[1:12:39] he's already been through it. Amen.
[1:12:41] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:12:46] So now when he did this, he became our
[1:12:50] kinsman
[1:12:51] redeemer. Now when we think about a
[1:12:54] kinsman
[1:12:55] redeemer, a kinsman redeemer actually
[1:12:58] goes a lot further than just God
[1:13:00] becoming flesh in order to redeem man
[1:13:04] and flesh. Because
[1:13:07] um in order to be a a kinsman, you have
[1:13:10] to be kinfolk.
[1:13:12] You know what it means to be kinfolk?
[1:13:14] You know what it means to be kin to
[1:13:16] someone else? It means that you're
[1:13:18] family.
[1:13:20] It means that you're either
[1:13:22] bloodreated or that you're family
[1:13:25] through marriage. So, Brother Nicholas
[1:13:29] is my kinfolk because he married my
[1:13:32] sister-in-law. And she's my kinfolk
[1:13:34] because I married her sister. And so,
[1:13:36] now we're we're kinfolk. We are we are
[1:13:39] related. We can become a a a kinsman. We
[1:13:42] can redeem each other if we had to
[1:13:45] according to the Old Testament laws
[1:13:47] because we are family.
[1:13:50] Now, if there was something in the Old
[1:13:52] Testament, if if there was something
[1:13:54] that uh say somebody fell behind on
[1:13:56] their bills and they were going to lose
[1:13:57] their house and they were going to lose
[1:13:58] their land and something was going to
[1:14:00] happen. If if there was a neighbor
[1:14:02] across the street and they said, "Wow,
[1:14:04] you know, you're really struggling. Let
[1:14:06] me come and let me help you. Let me pay
[1:14:08] for your bills. Let me let me redeem uh
[1:14:11] what you've
[1:14:12] lost." They were unable to do it.
[1:14:16] But wait a second, their flesh. They're
[1:14:19] flesh just like me. They're human beings
[1:14:20] just like me. They're they're kinsmen to
[1:14:22] me. They're kinsmen in flesh, but not by
[1:14:26] not by family.
[1:14:28] They're kinsmen in flesh, not by blood.
[1:14:31] Right? And so now kinsman redeemer goes
[1:14:36] further than God just becoming flesh to
[1:14:38] redeem man. But he came to redeem those
[1:14:43] who were kinfolk. Yes, he came to redeem
[1:14:47] those who was kinsmen to him who were
[1:14:50] part of his blood related who were a
[1:14:53] part of his family. Hallelujah. That's
[1:14:56] why Boaz could redeem Ruth because they
[1:14:59] were kinfolk.
[1:15:01] They were kinfolk through marriage.
[1:15:05] Do you see it?
[1:15:08] Why was Why was Ruth redeemed?
[1:15:12] Ruth was redeemed because she was
[1:15:14] redeemable.
[1:15:17] Why was Ruth
[1:15:18] redeemable? Because she was kinfolk to
[1:15:21] Boaz. Right? If she wasn't if Naomi
[1:15:24] wasn't kinfolk to Boaz, Boaz could never
[1:15:28] do the act of a redeemer of a kinsman
[1:15:31] redeemer to Naomi. He couldn't do it to
[1:15:34] get Ruth. Why? Because they're not
[1:15:35] kinfolk. She was redeemed because she
[1:15:39] was redeemable. And she was redeemable
[1:15:42] because she was kinfolk. And so it is
[1:15:44] with the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:15:46] Understand not everybody is redeemable
[1:15:49] in the world. But the bride of Jesus
[1:15:52] Christ is redeemable.
[1:15:54] Why is she redeemable? Because she is
[1:15:57] kinfolk. She's of his blood. She's from
[1:16:01] the same family. She's part of his
[1:16:03] flesh.
[1:16:05] Yes, sir. How am I redeemed? I'll tell
[1:16:09] you why you're redeemed. Because you're
[1:16:11] redeemable. That's why. Did I do
[1:16:13] anything to deserve it? No. I was just
[1:16:15] born into this family.
[1:16:18] There was nothing that I did to deserve
[1:16:20] it. It wasn't of my own choosing, but it
[1:16:23] was of my father's choosing. And I've
[1:16:25] been redeemed. And my life has been
[1:16:27] changed because I'm
[1:16:29] redeemable. Because there's something
[1:16:31] within my heart. It's called the logos
[1:16:33] of God. that when it came across the
[1:16:36] logos of the word and the anointing of
[1:16:38] the hour, guess what? It brought forth
[1:16:41] life and it brought forth redemption by
[1:16:44] blood.
[1:16:47] Thank you, Lord. That's why brother
[1:16:48] Brandon would say this. He would say uh
[1:16:52] uh John 3:16, for God so loved the world
[1:16:54] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:16:56] whoever would uh believe in him should
[1:16:58] not perish but have everlasting life.
[1:16:59] Brother Brandham said it's not for
[1:17:00] everybody.
[1:17:02] He would that everybody would be saved.
[1:17:07] He would. But he knows that there's a
[1:17:11] chosen people who are a part of him, who
[1:17:15] are off his sheepfold, who are off his
[1:17:18] body and part of his family that he came
[1:17:21] to redeem.
[1:17:24] Amen.
[1:17:26] My
[1:17:27] So if you've been redeemed, you ought to
[1:17:30] be shouting this morning. Why? Because
[1:17:33] your name has been written in the Lamb's
[1:17:35] book of life before the foundations of
[1:17:37] the world. Hallelujah.
[1:17:39] How do I know I've been redeemed?
[1:17:42] That's a good question, isn't it? Is it
[1:17:45] because I felt something and I had a
[1:17:47] shiver and and is it because I got
[1:17:50] baptized? Understand you can get
[1:17:52] baptized as many times as you want, but
[1:17:55] if you've never fully repented of your
[1:17:57] sin and turned from your life, you'll go
[1:17:59] down a wet a dry sinner and come up a
[1:18:02] wet one. But a true fact, a true a true
[1:18:06] uh a true way of knowing and
[1:18:08] acknowledging that you've been redeemed
[1:18:10] is because your life, Hallelujah.
[1:18:13] One Easter service, Brother Andy, you
[1:18:16] were walking this way and all of a
[1:18:18] sudden you did a roundabout turn and you
[1:18:20] looked to that thing right there, the
[1:18:21] cross of Calvary, and you began to walk
[1:18:24] to it. Something happened in your life.
[1:18:26] Something happened in our lives where
[1:18:28] God took away the desire of sin and
[1:18:31] riotous behaviors.
[1:18:34] When we turned our ways to the cross,
[1:18:37] you
[1:18:38] doesn't mean that you're not going to
[1:18:40] have mistakes. That's right. Doesn't
[1:18:42] mean that the old carnal nature won't
[1:18:44] come up once in a while. But when it
[1:18:47] does, it means this. You'll repent
[1:18:48] quickly. You'll make things right
[1:18:50] quickly because the desire in your heart
[1:18:54] is not to do those things.
[1:18:57] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:19:00] Yeah. I've said it before. I'll say it
[1:19:03] again. We all need to say sorry once in
[1:19:05] a while to each other. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:19:08] Especially, you know, uh especially
[1:19:12] especially our family. You know, the
[1:19:14] more comfortable you get with people,
[1:19:16] the more your carnal side comes out. You
[1:19:19] huh? You ever notice that? Or is that
[1:19:20] just me?
[1:19:23] You get comfortable with somebody, all
[1:19:24] of a sudden you let your hair down. Oh.
[1:19:26] Ah, I'm sorry. H you overreact to
[1:19:29] something. Hey, it's good to make things
[1:19:32] right quickly. It's good not to let your
[1:19:34] the the your wrath go down with the sun.
[1:19:37] Hey, it's good to good to set your
[1:19:39] family aside and say, "You know what? I
[1:19:41] overreacted and I am sorry." Yeah.
[1:19:44] Sister, lovely honey, whoever you are,
[1:19:47] guess what? I'm sorry. Wonder when the
[1:19:48] last time some of you boys ever said
[1:19:50] sorry to mom and dad. Huh? Sorry for
[1:19:53] slamming the door. Sorry for punching a
[1:19:55] hole in the wall. I know none of you
[1:19:57] guys do that. It happens. They're all
[1:20:00] laughing because they know it's true.
[1:20:03] Just be careful. Let me give you some
[1:20:05] advice. You want to punch a hole in the
[1:20:07] wall, make sure it's between the
[1:20:12] studs. That's
[1:20:14] right. Yeah.
[1:20:18] Yeah, brother Jim. Yeah, he could be a
[1:20:21] good stud
[1:20:23] finder. Bring some of these guys to work
[1:20:25] with us. Find a stud.
[1:20:31] Understand? Yes. Soft answer turns away
[1:20:33] wrath.
[1:20:35] You got wrath in your family, try
[1:20:37] talking a little bit softer. Hallelujah.
[1:20:40] Okay.
[1:20:45] Now, we see here, brother Brandham makes
[1:20:48] this this outstanding remark in the
[1:20:51] indictment 19 and68, brother Brandham or
[1:20:54] 1963, paragraph 68, brother Brandham
[1:20:57] says this, and my indictment is against
[1:20:59] the churches of today. Now, I'm not
[1:21:01] bringing the sinner into this. I'm just
[1:21:03] speaking this to the church. He says
[1:21:05] it's to be in the tapes now and I'll try
[1:21:09] to get through as quick as I can. He
[1:21:11] says, "I indict this generation for the
[1:21:13] second crucifixion of Jesus Christ."
[1:21:16] Paragraph 71, the same sermon. It could
[1:21:19] not have been done a few years ago. This
[1:21:22] is pretty powerful. He says, 'I say 50
[1:21:25] years ago, it could not have been done,
[1:21:27] but but today
[1:21:30] uh today this is very timely. And so
[1:21:34] when I read that, I begin to wonder,
[1:21:37] well, what time is he is he beginning to
[1:21:39] indict this generation? And when you
[1:21:41] look at the date of the indictment, it's
[1:21:44] 1963 uh
[1:21:46] 0707. So it's it's around June time or
[1:21:49] whatever it is. What time is it? Why is
[1:21:52] it so timely? because it's after the
[1:21:55] opening of the seven seals which
[1:21:57] happened in March. So now he says it
[1:22:00] couldn't have been done 50 years ago. It
[1:22:02] it it could barely but today it's very
[1:22:05] timely and it could not have been done
[1:22:07] maybe 10 years
[1:22:08] ago. Now watch this. He says but it can
[1:22:13] be done today because the time has run
[1:22:16] out. We are at the end time and I
[1:22:18] believe as a servant we are just about
[1:22:19] to cross this land to another.
[1:22:23] So now, brother Brandham is he's he's
[1:22:25] beginning to take uh happenings in his
[1:22:28] life and he's beginning to realize of
[1:22:30] what time of day it is that we're living
[1:22:33] in. And he says uh it couldn't have been
[1:22:36] done 50 years ago. It couldn't have been
[1:22:38] done 10 years ago, but now is the right
[1:22:41] time to do it because there has been an
[1:22:43] unfolding of the word. Now, uh many
[1:22:47] things transpired in brother Brandham's
[1:22:49] life. We understand that he moved to
[1:22:52] Tucson, Arizona according to six dreams.
[1:22:54] And on the seventh, the seventh was a
[1:22:57] vision. And we see that uh there had to
[1:22:59] be something that come to pass that they
[1:23:01] would extend the road um on his driveway
[1:23:04] and stuff like that. And whenever he
[1:23:07] would see these things come to pass that
[1:23:09] it was time for him to move west. And
[1:23:12] brother Brandham explains these things
[1:23:14] and sers, what time is it? And so when
[1:23:18] it begins to come to pass and he and and
[1:23:21] the and the dreams uh have been uh have
[1:23:24] been interpreted and he sees this this
[1:23:27] vision that the vision now has has
[1:23:29] become a reality. He knows that it's
[1:23:32] time to move west. Now God did with
[1:23:35] brother Brandham just as he did with
[1:23:37] Abraham. He did not tell him why he's
[1:23:40] moving west right off the bat but he
[1:23:42] just said when you see these things
[1:23:44] happening move west. And so he told
[1:23:47] Abraham, I just want you to get up and I
[1:23:49] want you to walk and I want you to take
[1:23:51] a journey. So God a lot of times he
[1:23:54] doesn't tell us. He'll give us an end
[1:23:56] result. He'll give us something to do,
[1:23:58] but he'll never tell us of the journey
[1:24:01] in between from the beginning until the
[1:24:04] end. And so God doesn't share everything
[1:24:07] with us. True. Sometimes you can go to
[1:24:11] the preacher. You say, "Preacher, I I I
[1:24:14] have this question or or or what about
[1:24:16] this in my life?" You know, sometimes we
[1:24:19] we don't have an answer. Right?
[1:24:21] Sometimes God doesn't want us to have an
[1:24:23] answer, but he wants you to wrestle with
[1:24:26] the angel yourself.
[1:24:29] He wants you to wrestle. He wants your
[1:24:31] life to be changed. He wants you to to
[1:24:33] to stay up at night and pray and cry and
[1:24:36] wonder and sob and ask questions. He
[1:24:39] doesn't want you just to be lazy and ask
[1:24:41] somebody else, but he wants you to spend
[1:24:44] time with him yourself. Very good. So,
[1:24:48] we see he moves to Arizona and one day
[1:24:51] he's up there in the Catalina mountains
[1:24:52] and this sword strikes his hand and and
[1:24:55] he looks at it and he says this, "This
[1:24:57] sword fit my hand just perfectly." And
[1:24:59] there was a voice and it said that this
[1:25:01] is the king's sword and we understand
[1:25:03] that it was the sword of the word. And I
[1:25:05] want you to know that just as Elijah
[1:25:08] gave Elisha his garments, it fit Elisha
[1:25:11] just perfectly. This same sword, this
[1:25:13] same word that fit in Brother Brandham's
[1:25:15] hand just perfectly fits in the hand of
[1:25:18] the bride just perfectly. This sword was
[1:25:21] made for you. This sword wasn't made for
[1:25:24] you to collect dust on the on on the
[1:25:26] shelf or in your study or on the floor
[1:25:28] or whatever. No, this sword was made
[1:25:30] specifically for you to use the word
[1:25:33] because it's the word that overcomes the
[1:25:36] hour. It's the word that overcomes the
[1:25:38] temptation of the hour in which we're
[1:25:40] living in. The word of God will defeat
[1:25:44] the enemy, any place, any time,
[1:25:46] anywhere, under any circumstances
[1:25:50] when used by faith.
[1:25:55] So, we see he gets caught up the
[1:25:56] constellation of angels and and he's
[1:25:59] given a word and he's given the the he's
[1:26:01] he's he's told he's saying, "Hey, you
[1:26:03] need to go back east and you need to
[1:26:05] preach uh the the seven seals because
[1:26:08] I'm going to open the word." And and
[1:26:10] he's just walking by
[1:26:12] faith. and he goes back east and he goes
[1:26:16] in his study and and he and he's trying
[1:26:18] to prepare his notes and and and and
[1:26:21] he's trying to find the mind of God and
[1:26:23] obviously he couldn't find the mind of
[1:26:25] God because he he just put together
[1:26:28] notes and stuff from things he preached
[1:26:30] in the past and books that he had read
[1:26:32] in the past and and he said, "Well, this
[1:26:34] sounds about right. I'll just preach
[1:26:36] this." You know, sometimes you got to
[1:26:38] work to find the mind of God.
[1:26:41] Not only the minister, but you also you
[1:26:45] got to work. You got to you got to
[1:26:47] study. You got to sometimes you got to
[1:26:49] labor. You got to labor in pain to find
[1:26:52] the mind of God for your life.
[1:26:57] It's not easy.
[1:26:59] You ever tried to make a decision and
[1:27:01] you got two choices and both doors are
[1:27:04] opened? Yeah. Wow, they both look good.
[1:27:07] I could do this or I could do that. How
[1:27:09] do you know? Well, I'll just do one and
[1:27:12] see. Sometimes we got to labor.
[1:27:15] Sometimes we got to wait before God. We
[1:27:17] got to get ourselves alone in a desert
[1:27:20] place and we got to pray and we got to
[1:27:22] ask.
[1:27:24] And God forbid once in a while you got
[1:27:27] to fast. That's true.
[1:27:30] You know that
[1:27:31] fasting, it takes your carnality away.
[1:27:36] You know, if you're carnal and you fast
[1:27:38] for a little while, all of a sudden you
[1:27:40] feel like a burden is taken away. You
[1:27:43] feel like you can just pray and enter in
[1:27:45] a little bit better and a little bit
[1:27:48] easier. I'm not talking about 40-day
[1:27:51] fasts. I'm talking about skip a couple
[1:27:54] of
[1:27:55] meals and don't do it because you want
[1:27:57] to lose weight.
[1:27:59] I'm doing the 16 and 8 today. God's
[1:28:01] going to speak to my heart. No nonsense.
[1:28:05] God knows the desire in your heart. But
[1:28:08] when you come to God and you say,
[1:28:09] "Father, I'm this food that keeps me
[1:28:13] alive. This water that that keeps me
[1:28:15] hydrated, I'm going to set it to the
[1:28:18] side for two meals. I'm going to skip
[1:28:20] breakfast today because I want to pray
[1:28:22] at 9:00 and I want to ask, Father, and I
[1:28:24] and and I want to pray tomorrow. And I
[1:28:26] want to do the same thing, Lord, because
[1:28:28] I want you to guide me and direct me in
[1:28:31] in your perfect will. Amen.
[1:28:35] Hallelujah.
[1:28:38] So now the seals are opened. The Bible
[1:28:41] becomes a new book. The mystery of God
[1:28:44] is fulfilled according to Revelation
[1:28:46] 10:7. The book which was once closed is
[1:28:50] now open. And the word of God is laying
[1:28:52] before him in its completeness.
[1:28:55] understand his Bible became a new book.
[1:29:00] He read it differently. The revelation
[1:29:03] was more clear than what it was before
[1:29:05] the opening of the seals. Even though
[1:29:08] many things he preached before the
[1:29:10] opening of the
[1:29:12] seals, he preached serpent seed before
[1:29:14] opening of the seals. He preached water
[1:29:17] baptism before opening of the seals. He
[1:29:19] preached godhead before the opening of
[1:29:20] the seals. But what did the opening of
[1:29:22] the seals do? It brought a special
[1:29:24] anointing and instead of just wondering,
[1:29:27] it opened it up in its in complete
[1:29:30] clarity that he said, "Wow, any wonder
[1:29:34] I've been against those denominations
[1:29:35] for so long. I always wondered why."
[1:29:39] Well, now he knows why. Why? Because the
[1:29:43] book was opened and now the book was
[1:29:45] revealed in its completeness. Amen. So
[1:29:48] when Jesus was here, we understand that
[1:29:52] he was the fulfillment of the word and
[1:29:55] he was the word in its fullness. He was
[1:29:58] the word made flesh and dwelling amongst
[1:30:03] us. And when the word was dwelling
[1:30:05] amongst us in its fullness, the word
[1:30:08] which Jesus Christ I'm talking about was
[1:30:11] crucified. So now, brother Brandham,
[1:30:14] after the opening of the seals, he's
[1:30:16] beginning to see this is an open book.
[1:30:20] It's a new book. And it's not just a
[1:30:22] book, but it's the word. And who is the
[1:30:25] word? It's Christ. So now the same Jesus
[1:30:29] that was crucified, who was made flesh
[1:30:31] back there, is the same Jesus in this
[1:30:34] open word. It's a full word. It's a
[1:30:37] complete word. is no longer in its
[1:30:40] partness, but now it is completely
[1:30:42] opened and revealed. Amen. So now it's
[1:30:45] very timely, he says. Why? Because here
[1:30:49] is Christ the word. And so now he begins
[1:30:54] to look and he and he and he sees what
[1:30:56] denominations have done to the word by
[1:30:58] their creeds, dogmas, intelligence,
[1:31:02] reasonings of man's ideas. And he and
[1:31:04] something rises up in him and he says,
[1:31:06] "I indict this generation." Yes. For the
[1:31:10] second crucifixion of Jesus Christ, the
[1:31:13] word which is being made flesh amongst
[1:31:16] us. Why? Because it is now open.
[1:31:19] What a
[1:31:21] statement. He had seen what they were
[1:31:23] doing to the word throughout all the
[1:31:25] years, but it wasn't time to bring the
[1:31:28] indictment. But now the timing was
[1:31:31] perfect.
[1:31:33] Go listen to the sermon. Brother
[1:31:35] Brandham said the same spirit that did
[1:31:37] that to Jesus and we'll go through it
[1:31:40] here and I'm going to try to hurry. What
[1:31:42] they did to him at the cross, what they
[1:31:43] did to him when they scorched him, what
[1:31:45] they did to him when they plucked his
[1:31:46] beard and so on and so forth is the
[1:31:49] exact same spirits that's doing the
[1:31:51] exact same thing to the word of this
[1:31:53] day.
[1:31:57] Only it's not in a body of flesh. It's
[1:31:59] in the word. But if you can visualize
[1:32:03] the crucifixion, you can see what
[1:32:06] they're doing to the word of God. God,
[1:32:09] help us. Let me just say this. God, help
[1:32:11] us as message believers, not to add to,
[1:32:14] not to take away from the word, not to
[1:32:16] reason with the word with our own ideas,
[1:32:18] but just say what a prophet of God said.
[1:32:23] Amen. Otherwise, we fall under the same
[1:32:27] category. Yeah. because of our
[1:32:29] reasoning, because of our man-made
[1:32:32] ideas, because of our taking a quote
[1:32:34] over here and taking a quote over there
[1:32:36] and trying to put it together. It's it
[1:32:39] it it makes up a denomination
[1:32:42] within the message. That's right. Cuz
[1:32:46] what is a denomination? It's when you
[1:32:47] put a period instead of a comma and you
[1:32:49] organize under a man-made idea.
[1:32:53] Hallelujah. Think of it yourself. Yeah.
[1:32:57] Say, "Brother Stephen, why don't you
[1:32:59] just Why don't you just hit on some
[1:33:01] stuff, man?" Nah. Don't need to. Let the
[1:33:04] word do it. You know, and then when you
[1:33:08] know, you'll know when I get off.
[1:33:10] Hallelujah. And then you'll say,
[1:33:12] "Brother Stephen, you're putting a
[1:33:14] period instead of a comma, son." Amen.
[1:33:16] Erase it and put a comma.
[1:33:20] That's right. Amen.
[1:33:23] Guess keep each other accountable.
[1:33:26] Hallelujah.
[1:33:28] Okay. So, Jesus suffered many things at
[1:33:33] Calvary. And if I may uh if I may for
[1:33:37] just 20 minutes or so, I would like to
[1:33:39] go over and rehearse to you some of the
[1:33:42] things that Christ went
[1:33:44] through in the sermon adoption 1960.
[1:33:49] Brother Brandham said this. He says in
[1:33:51] the garden of Gethsemane, this is very,
[1:33:53] we all know this. The anointing left
[1:33:55] him, you know, and he had to die as a
[1:33:57] sinner. He died a sinner. You know that.
[1:34:01] Not his sins, but mine and yours. That's
[1:34:04] where that love come in. Hallelujah. How
[1:34:06] he took mine. Oh, hallelujah. How he
[1:34:09] took mine. So up until this point now,
[1:34:11] every temptation and everything that he
[1:34:13] went through, he had the anointing with
[1:34:15] him and he was able to overcome because
[1:34:18] he was so anointed with God. But now
[1:34:21] here he is in the garden of Gethsemane.
[1:34:24] And here he is. He has never known sin
[1:34:26] in his life. He was a he was the perfect
[1:34:28] lamb of God without spot, without shame,
[1:34:31] without sin. He was perfect before God.
[1:34:33] And now here he was in his greatest hour
[1:34:35] of temptation. The anointing had left
[1:34:37] him. the disciples were falling asleep.
[1:34:40] There's one spot where I've always kind
[1:34:42] of ridiculed the disciples in my heart
[1:34:44] of, well, how could they fall asleep
[1:34:46] when they saw the shape he was in? The
[1:34:48] Bible says in in one of the gospels, it
[1:34:50] says for sorrow,
[1:34:53] they fell asleep.
[1:34:55] They got weary. They they they seen they
[1:34:59] seen the pressure he was under. They
[1:35:01] seen what was happening to him. They
[1:35:02] they saw a change in his demeanor. Yeah,
[1:35:05] they saw that something was off and
[1:35:07] something wasn't right and and and here
[1:35:09] he was in his greatness and they were so
[1:35:11] sorrowful for him. He had been telling
[1:35:14] him that he'd be crucified and and and
[1:35:16] he'd be given into the hands of the
[1:35:18] elders and all these different things
[1:35:19] and the scribes and they were sorrowful.
[1:35:22] Have you ever gotten so sorrowful that
[1:35:24] you just get tired and you cry yourself
[1:35:26] to sleep? I'm sure we've all done it
[1:35:29] once or twice in our lives. They were
[1:35:32] sorrowful. They were exhausted.
[1:35:35] And when he needed them the most, they
[1:35:37] were
[1:35:39] sleeping. And here he was, he's under so
[1:35:42] much pressure.
[1:35:44] And he kneels before God and he's
[1:35:46] crying. He said, "Oh,
[1:35:49] Father, let this cup pass from me. I
[1:35:53] can't stand it." It's not that he didn't
[1:35:55] want to do it. What cup was that? It was
[1:35:58] the cup of iniquity. It was the cup of
[1:36:01] my sins and your sins that he was about
[1:36:04] to be partaker of. He who knew no sin
[1:36:06] was about to become sin for you and I.
[1:36:10] The one the the guiltless was about to
[1:36:13] become guilty. He was about to take the
[1:36:16] place and take the blame for someone
[1:36:18] else's faults.
[1:36:20] But that's what he came to do. Thank
[1:36:24] you, Lord. And he was under so much
[1:36:27] pressure and so much turmoil and so much
[1:36:30] and he was crying out to God and he
[1:36:32] says, "Nevertheless, Lord, not my will,
[1:36:36] but let thine be done." Sometimes God
[1:36:40] gets us to a place for us to scream out,
[1:36:43] "Lord, not my will. I'm tired of my
[1:36:46] will. My will leads me down the wrong
[1:36:49] paths, but let thy will be done, Lord.
[1:36:55] Sometimes your Gethsemane is humbling
[1:36:58] yourself.
[1:37:01] It's true. It's so hard for us as
[1:37:03] prideful humanity.
[1:37:06] To humble ourselves and say sorry and
[1:37:09] say, "Lord, not my will.
[1:37:12] Let thine be done." He was under this
[1:37:13] immense pressure until suddenly his his
[1:37:16] his blood vessels begin to burst and
[1:37:20] Luke the physician picks it up. No other
[1:37:23] gospel writer picks it up, but look the
[1:37:25] physician and he sees it and great sweat
[1:37:28] drops of blood started dripping from his
[1:37:32] forehead. No doubt it was dripping down
[1:37:34] his back, down his arms, down his
[1:37:36] forehead. This sweat was bright red of
[1:37:41] blood. Can you imagine when the when the
[1:37:45] scribes and the Pharisees and the elders
[1:37:46] and they came to get him and here he is?
[1:37:49] He's already looks like he's tarnished
[1:37:51] with blood. He's sweating. He doesn't
[1:37:55] This guy don't look like he's in his
[1:37:57] right mind. What's What's going on with
[1:37:58] this guy?
[1:38:03] He was in great
[1:38:05] sorrow. He was He was in great pain and
[1:38:09] suffering and it was a calamity in his
[1:38:13] life. Yeah.
[1:38:15] But yet instead of choosing the easy way
[1:38:18] out, he took the hard way
[1:38:20] because he had a journey that he had to
[1:38:22] go through. And that was at a place
[1:38:24] called Golgtha. And there wasn't
[1:38:26] anything even his own human emotions was
[1:38:29] going to keep him from fulfilling the
[1:38:31] word of God that God had planned for him
[1:38:33] and his life. Understand? If you just
[1:38:36] put your face towards Jerusalem, if you
[1:38:38] just put your face towards the cross of
[1:38:40] Jesus Christ, it doesn't matter what
[1:38:42] comes or goes. He'll say, "Father, not
[1:38:45] my will, but let thine be done."
[1:38:55] Matthew 27:es
[1:38:57] 21-31. The governor answered and said
[1:39:00] unto them, "Whether of the twain will ye
[1:39:02] that I release unto you?" They said,
[1:39:04] "Babbus." Pilate saith unto them, "What
[1:39:07] shall I do then which with with Jesus
[1:39:09] which is called Christ?" They all say
[1:39:12] unto him, "Let him be
[1:39:13] crucified." And the governor said,"Wh,
[1:39:16] what evil hath he done?" But they cried
[1:39:19] the more, saying, "Let him be
[1:39:20] crucified." When Pilate saw that it
[1:39:22] could prevail nothing, but rather a
[1:39:24] tumult was made, he took water and
[1:39:25] washed his hands before the multitude,
[1:39:27] saying, I am innocent of the blood of
[1:39:29] this person. See ye to it. Then answered
[1:39:33] all the people and said, "His blood be
[1:39:35] upon us and upon our children." Can you
[1:39:38] imagine? Can you can you visualize in
[1:39:40] your mind the hatred that they had
[1:39:42] towards this man who did nothing wrong,
[1:39:45] who walked the shores of Galilee, who
[1:39:47] healed the sick, who opened the blinded
[1:39:49] eyes, who who who prayed, who touched
[1:39:52] hands upon the paralyzed, and they begin
[1:39:54] to walk. And he he raised the dead, he
[1:39:56] did many mighty works, yet they hated
[1:39:58] him
[1:39:59] for righteousness sake. Why? Because
[1:40:02] evil was found in their hearts.
[1:40:07] You know, when somebody has a quarrel or
[1:40:12] something against you for no reason,
[1:40:14] I'll tell you why. It's because there's
[1:40:16] evil in their hearts.
[1:40:18] You say believers, absolutely. Religious
[1:40:21] people, religious people have a lot of
[1:40:24] evil in their hearts and they can't see
[1:40:26] the evil that they have towards their
[1:40:29] fellow brother or sister.
[1:40:31] Help us, Lord.
[1:40:34] Yeah. evil. Say the bride, we don't we
[1:40:37] we're we don't have no evil in us. Yeah.
[1:40:40] Well, your fruits say otherwise.
[1:40:45] Yeah.
[1:40:46] Hallelujah.
[1:40:49] Then released he Barabus and said unto
[1:40:51] them, and when he had scored scorged
[1:40:55] Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
[1:40:57] Then the soldiers of the governor took
[1:40:59] Jesus into the common hall and gathered
[1:41:00] unto him the whole band of soldiers. And
[1:41:02] they stripped him and put him in a
[1:41:04] scarlet robe. And when they had platted
[1:41:05] a crown of thorns, they put it upon his
[1:41:07] head and a reed in his right hand. And
[1:41:09] and they bowed the name before him. They
[1:41:12] mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the
[1:41:15] Jews." Someday these soldiers that
[1:41:19] thought they were just having some big
[1:41:21] laugh, they had dressed him up as a king
[1:41:23] and bowed before him, someday they're
[1:41:25] going to bow before him. Amen. And the
[1:41:28] tables are going to be turned.
[1:41:31] If you want mercy in your life, show
[1:41:33] mercy. Yes. Whatever judgment you judge
[1:41:36] somebody else with, that's the judgment
[1:41:37] you're going to be met with yourself.
[1:41:40] Help us, Lord.
[1:41:45] I wouldn't want to be in their shoes.
[1:41:49] Oh, thank God for grace.
[1:41:52] Thank you, Lord. Thank God for the
[1:41:54] logos. Amen. That dwells within the
[1:41:57] heart of the believer. Amen. that brings
[1:41:59] them to a place of repentance because
[1:42:02] there go I mocking and scorging and
[1:42:06] spitting and hitting them if it wasn't
[1:42:08] for the grace of God. That's right.
[1:42:11] And they spit upon
[1:42:14] him. That's so
[1:42:17] dirty.
[1:42:19] Huh? Spit on
[1:42:21] them. Somebody's dirty
[1:42:24] slobber. Such a dis disrespectful thing.
[1:42:28] I'd rather somebody call me the worst
[1:42:30] name in the world and spit on me. I
[1:42:33] don't know if I could hold my Christian
[1:42:34] character if someone spit on me.
[1:42:37] I'm dead serious.
[1:42:42] Make you want to pick something up and
[1:42:43] hit him with it.
[1:42:47] But the Bible said, see that's the
[1:42:49] carnal man, isn't it? Yeah. But the
[1:42:52] Bible said he opened not his mouth. Wow.
[1:42:55] He reviled not. Wow.
[1:42:59] I wonder if we're able to do that. I
[1:43:01] don't know. I don't know. It would have
[1:43:03] to be something supernatural
[1:43:06] that would come over us like when that
[1:43:09] bull and and the beast and everything
[1:43:11] came to brother Brandham and he said
[1:43:13] something came over me. That man that
[1:43:15] one said he was going to take his life
[1:43:17] and run up to the pulpit. He said I had
[1:43:19] love for that man. He says I wish it
[1:43:22] would happen all the time.
[1:43:25] Amen. So do I.
[1:43:30] That's what we need, my friend.
[1:43:33] The love of God. Otherwise, the carnal
[1:43:36] man takes over so easily.
[1:43:41] They mocked him. And after they had
[1:43:43] mocked him, they took the robe off from
[1:43:45] him, put his own raignment on him, and
[1:43:47] led him away to crucify him. Isaiah
[1:43:50] 50:6, I give my back to the
[1:43:53] smiters and my cheeks to them that
[1:43:55] plucked off the
[1:43:57] hair. I hidden up my face from shame and
[1:44:01] spitting. Isaiah 52:14. As many were
[1:44:04] astonished at
[1:44:06] thee, his visage visage was so marred
[1:44:10] more than any man, and his form more
[1:44:14] than the sons of men. You know what that
[1:44:17] means? They beat the daylights out of
[1:44:20] him until finally his visage was as bad.
[1:44:24] They couldn't recognize
[1:44:26] who he was for his human
[1:44:29] features because they had beat him so
[1:44:32] hard.
[1:44:35] They had punched him. They smited him.
[1:44:38] They whipped him. They beat him. And I
[1:44:41] love that the Bible says there, it says
[1:44:44] that I gave my back to the
[1:44:51] smiters. He didn't try to run away.
[1:44:55] He didn't try to
[1:44:57] turn. He didn't try to wiggle out of it.
[1:45:00] But instead,
[1:45:04] he turned his
[1:45:06] back to the smiters. He turned not his
[1:45:10] face when they punched him. They turned
[1:45:12] not his face when they spit on him. He
[1:45:16] turned not his face when they plucked
[1:45:18] his beard.
[1:45:20] Why? Because he had a purpose in his
[1:45:24] life. He had a reason for being there.
[1:45:27] You know why he turned his back? Because
[1:45:29] he knew that you would be in need of it
[1:45:31] someday. Amen. Thank you, Lord. He knew
[1:45:33] that you would be in need of healing
[1:45:35] someday. So he turned his back and he
[1:45:38] had you in his mind and he took a whip.
[1:45:41] Then he took another whip and there goes
[1:45:43] that cold and there goes the the sugar
[1:45:45] diabetes and this one over here with
[1:45:48] cancer and this one over here and he
[1:45:50] said, "Father, I have come that thy will
[1:45:52] would be done."
[1:45:56] It didn't matter how much they beat him.
[1:45:59] It didn't matter how much they tormented
[1:46:01] him. It didn't matter how much they
[1:46:03] tortured his body. His mind had his mind
[1:46:07] was strong. You know, you can break
[1:46:09] someone's you can break their someone's
[1:46:11] body, but they're not broken until you
[1:46:13] break their mind. He was so strong
[1:46:16] minded. Why? Because he had an elected
[1:46:18] lady within his mind that he knew would
[1:46:22] need those stripes someday.
[1:46:24] Thank you, Lord. He said, "I'm not going
[1:46:26] to turn. I'm not going to wiggle away.
[1:46:27] I'm not going to turn my face. I'm going
[1:46:29] to give myself because you can't make me
[1:46:32] do anything. I freely give my life. I
[1:46:35] freely give my back. I freely give my
[1:46:37] cheeks. I freely give my face. I freely
[1:46:40] lay down my life because God has given
[1:46:43] me power to lay down my life and to
[1:46:46] raise it back up again.
[1:46:48] Thank you, Lord.
[1:46:51] Thank you. He didn't do it because they
[1:46:53] made him.
[1:46:55] It was either Pilate or Herod. They told
[1:46:57] him, "Don't you know that I have power
[1:47:00] over you?" He said, "You don't have no
[1:47:02] power over me unless it was given to you
[1:47:05] from above."
[1:47:09] You ain't going to make me do nothing,
[1:47:12] but I'm going to do it freely. Oh, I
[1:47:14] want to give my life to him freely this
[1:47:16] morning. Don't you? He gave his life
[1:47:18] freely for me. I want to reciprocate.
[1:47:20] And I want to say, "Father, here's my
[1:47:22] life. I freely give it. I don't want to
[1:47:24] turn away to the left. I don't want to
[1:47:25] turn away to the right. I don't want to
[1:47:27] try to wiggle out of it, Lord. But here
[1:47:29] I am. All of my inconsistencies, all of
[1:47:32] my downfalls and shortcomings,
[1:47:34] everything that I have, I give it to
[1:47:36] you, Lord,
[1:47:39] freely,
[1:47:41] not begrudgingly, not holding back, but
[1:47:44] here I give it. My desires, my wants, my
[1:47:49] will. Here it is, Lord. I give it to you
[1:47:52] freely. Amen.
[1:48:00] You say how can he with
[1:48:03] withstand such punishment? He was
[1:48:07] constrained by love. Amen.
[1:48:11] He was
[1:48:12] constrained for his love for those whom
[1:48:17] the father
[1:48:18] loves. For those who God imparted a
[1:48:20] little bit of the logos in. He loved him
[1:48:22] so much that he said, "Here I am. Freely
[1:48:26] I give."
[1:48:28] Thank you, Lord. Jesus was the
[1:48:30] fulfillment of the Old Testament
[1:48:32] prophecies. We know it. Shadows, types,
[1:48:35] whatever it may be, we know that he was
[1:48:37] the lamb of God without spot or blemish.
[1:48:40] He was the Passover lamb.
[1:48:45] Something that is
[1:48:47] extremely interesting to me is that even
[1:48:50] the very timing of his crucifixion is
[1:48:55] perfect. That by his death, we know that
[1:48:58] he would do away with the daily
[1:49:00] sacrifice. This is amazing. Some people
[1:49:03] try to say that this isn't true. But
[1:49:05] yet, whenever you see that the Old
[1:49:07] Testament lines up with the New
[1:49:09] Testament and this prophesied and it
[1:49:11] came to pass here and and and all these
[1:49:13] different things and we see how is that
[1:49:15] possible, I'm going to tell you it's not
[1:49:17] possible. But anything is possible with
[1:49:20] God.
[1:49:22] So, Exodus, I'm almost done. Exodus 29
[1:49:26] 38 and 39. Oh
[1:49:30] man. It says, "Thou this is that which
[1:49:34] thou shalt offer upon the altar. Two
[1:49:36] lambs of the first year day by day
[1:49:39] continually. The one lamb thou shalt
[1:49:41] offer in the morning and the other lamb
[1:49:43] thou shalt offer at evening." Now this
[1:49:46] scripture that we just read, it's
[1:49:47] referring to the daily sacrifice that
[1:49:49] was supposed to be performed in the
[1:49:52] morning and evening of each day. And
[1:49:54] these sacrifices meant the covering of
[1:49:56] sin and restoration and fellowship with
[1:50:00] God. It was a daily act of worship
[1:50:03] expressing expressing devotion and
[1:50:06] obedience to God. And it was also these
[1:50:10] these sacrifices. It was an expression
[1:50:12] of the people's commitment to the
[1:50:14] covenant and God's faithfulness to his
[1:50:17] promises. Now, I want you to those what
[1:50:21] what I just said there. I want you to to
[1:50:23] to put it in New Testament um uh uh
[1:50:27] verbiage here. And the Bible says that
[1:50:29] that your bodies are a living sacrifice
[1:50:32] which we are supposed to pres present
[1:50:34] onto God on a daily basis which is our
[1:50:37] reasonable service. And so our
[1:50:40] reasonable service of self sacrifice of
[1:50:44] self giving up self-will and of giving
[1:50:47] up our own wills and to God. It is a
[1:50:50] daily act of worship. It is a an
[1:50:53] expression of our lives of our devotion
[1:50:56] and obedience to God. Well, why do you
[1:50:58] do these things? Because I want to be
[1:51:00] devoted. I want to express my love to
[1:51:03] God through the sacrifice of myself on a
[1:51:06] daily basis, morning and night.
[1:51:11] I want to daily worship God and express
[1:51:13] myself to him. How do we worship God?
[1:51:17] Number one, you you believe the word
[1:51:19] that was sent in the day and hour in
[1:51:20] which you're living in. That's
[1:51:22] worshiping God. True worship of God. But
[1:51:25] yet now it comes down to us sacrificing
[1:51:28] our lives. Wow. Giving up self-will,
[1:51:32] crucifying the flesh on a daily basis is
[1:51:36] a sign of worship and devotion to our
[1:51:40] father. Amen.
[1:51:43] It is commonly known that the times of
[1:51:46] these sacrifices was at the third and
[1:51:48] 9inth hour of the day. the exact times
[1:51:52] when they put Jesus on the cross when he
[1:51:54] died. Mark chapter 15 verse 25 and it
[1:51:58] was the third
[1:51:59] hour and they crucified him. What was
[1:52:02] the time? It was the third hour. What's
[1:52:05] the time of the third hour?
[1:52:08] No, the third hour is at
[1:52:11] 9:00. The sixth hour is at
[1:52:14] 12:00 and the 9inth hour is at 3:00. And
[1:52:18] so here he was the daily sacrifice was
[1:52:22] being made in the temple. A an act of
[1:52:25] worship and devotion. They were they
[1:52:27] were in their post of duty doing what
[1:52:29] they should do. But yet here was the
[1:52:31] that was just a shadow. It was a type
[1:52:34] looking forward to what was on the cross
[1:52:37] at that very time. And what was he
[1:52:39] doing? He was taken away the daily
[1:52:42] sacrifice
[1:52:43] because it'll be no longer by bulls and
[1:52:45] goats, but by the precious blood of
[1:52:49] Jesus Christ.
[1:52:51] Amen. Mark
[1:52:53] 15:33-37. And when the sixth hour was
[1:52:55] come, there was darkness over the whole
[1:52:57] land until the 9inth hour. Notice that
[1:53:00] until the 9inth hour. What is so
[1:53:02] important about the ninth hour? It was
[1:53:05] the time of the evening sacrifice.
[1:53:07] Watch what happens at the ninth hour.
[1:53:10] And in the ninth hour, Jesus cried with
[1:53:12] a loud voice, saying, Eli,
[1:53:14] Eli, Lama Sabathani, which is being
[1:53:17] interpreted, my God, my God, why hast
[1:53:20] thou forsaken me? And some of them stood
[1:53:23] by when they heard it, and said, Behold,
[1:53:25] he called for Elias. Understand, they
[1:53:27] had no revelation. They had no
[1:53:29] interpretation of the tongues for their
[1:53:31] day. All they heard was something that
[1:53:34] sounds like Elias, and they said, "He's
[1:53:35] calling for Elias." But really he was
[1:53:38] calling to
[1:53:39] God. That's right.
[1:53:42] They were without revelation, without
[1:53:45] understanding, without the uh the
[1:53:47] knowledge of God for the hour in which
[1:53:49] they were living in. And what did it
[1:53:52] cause them to do? It caused them to
[1:53:55] misinterpret the word. Come on. That's
[1:53:58] right. Amen. Ah, put it in our day. What
[1:54:01] is causing the people of this day to
[1:54:03] misinterpret the word? It's because they
[1:54:05] don't have the Holy Ghost.
[1:54:10] And one ran and filled a sponge full of
[1:54:12] vinegar and put on a reed and gave him
[1:54:13] to drink, saying, "Let alone. Let us see
[1:54:16] whether Elias will come to take him
[1:54:18] down." Look, they were always looking
[1:54:20] for a second coming of
[1:54:23] Elias. They were looking for the wrong
[1:54:26] one. Elias was going to come again, but
[1:54:28] he wasn't coming to the Jews at that
[1:54:30] time. It would be to the Gentiles. A lot
[1:54:32] of Gentiles in this day are looking for
[1:54:34] a a return of an Elias. An Elias isn't
[1:54:37] going to return to the Gentiles, but
[1:54:39] he's going to return to the Jews.
[1:54:42] Let's not get it mixed up, brother,
[1:54:44] sister.
[1:54:48] In the sixth
[1:54:49] hour, understand Jesus was
[1:54:53] forsaken, but he was not defeated.
[1:54:57] Forsaken, but not defeated. And there
[1:55:01] they crucified
[1:55:04] him.
[1:55:06] Hallelujah. It was midnight in the
[1:55:08] middle of the day.
[1:55:11] The sun forbid to
[1:55:13] shine. The moon didn't shine. The stars
[1:55:15] weren't out. The birds went back to
[1:55:18] their nests. The cows stopped grazing in
[1:55:22] the grass. The sheep sat down and put
[1:55:25] their head in the grass. The animals hid
[1:55:27] their faces. For who can withstand this
[1:55:30] sight of this man hanging on a tree?
[1:55:36] Not even God himself
[1:55:38] could look at it. But he turned his back
[1:55:42] and he cried out with a longing. Why?
[1:55:46] Why? Why have thou
[1:55:50] forsaken me?
[1:55:54] He was forsaken that you wouldn't be.
[1:55:58] Jesus was forsaken of God that you would
[1:56:02] never be forsaken. Understand there will
[1:56:05] be times where we'll go through a
[1:56:07] midnight in the middle of the day. But I
[1:56:09] want you to know that you will never be
[1:56:11] forsaken because his word says he'll be
[1:56:14] with you. He says he'll be in you even
[1:56:16] until the end. He can't forsake the body
[1:56:19] because the body has already been
[1:56:21] forsaken.
[1:56:24] That's why the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:56:26] cannot be judged because the body has
[1:56:29] already been judged at Calvary.
[1:56:32] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:56:37] This is where all religions of the world
[1:56:39] stop and wait for the resurrection of
[1:56:42] their founder. Understand, every
[1:56:44] religion is built under some man, but
[1:56:46] they're all waiting for the return of
[1:56:48] their founder. What are they waiting
[1:56:50] for? They're waiting for them to
[1:56:52] resurrect. We're not waiting for a
[1:56:54] resurrection of the founder of
[1:56:56] Christianity because he is already risen
[1:56:58] and he is already alive and he remains
[1:57:01] the same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:57:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:08] Yeah. He went to
[1:57:10] hell. He went down there. Took the keys
[1:57:14] of of of death and hell and the grave.
[1:57:18] You know what else he took down to hell
[1:57:20] with him? He took your sins. He took my
[1:57:23] sins. He took my shortcomings. He took
[1:57:26] my failures. And when he went down there
[1:57:28] and he took the keys of Satan, the keys
[1:57:30] of of sin, of death, and in hell and the
[1:57:33] grave, and he rose again, he was, what
[1:57:35] was he doing? He was breaking the seals.
[1:57:37] He was breaking the seal of death. He
[1:57:39] was breaking the seal of of of the grave
[1:57:42] that no man had ever risen from before.
[1:57:45] He was breaking it. Right. Amen.
[1:57:50] And what was he doing while he was
[1:57:51] breaking those seals? He was leaving
[1:57:54] everything that you done in your past,
[1:57:56] your present and future, and he was
[1:57:58] leaving it into the hands of Satan and s
[1:58:00] in hell. He became sin.
[1:58:04] Hallelujah. He took my hell. He took
[1:58:07] your hill.
[1:58:09] Thank you. How amazing is that? Huh? We
[1:58:14] oughtn't let it be common to us. Yeah, I
[1:58:18] know he did to you. When you fully
[1:58:20] understand it and you fully grasp a
[1:58:23] revelation of it, my it just it it just
[1:58:26] takes it just softens your heart and it
[1:58:28] makes you weak at your knees to think
[1:58:30] that he did that for you and I. Amen.
[1:58:34] Colossians 2 verse14 blotting out the
[1:58:36] handwriting of ordinances that was
[1:58:38] against us which was contrary to us and
[1:58:42] took it out of the way nailing it to the
[1:58:44] cross. That's why Paul could say, "Oh
[1:58:47] death, where is your sting? Oh grave,
[1:58:49] where is your victory?" The be of death,
[1:58:51] we understand, has now lost its stinger.
[1:58:54] And now God uses death as nothing but a
[1:58:56] harness to pull us from from from this
[1:58:59] life into another realm which is faster
[1:59:03] than this one. So therefore, death, we
[1:59:05] have nothing to fear in death. Thank
[1:59:08] you, Lord.
[1:59:10] God uses it. Death was a scary thing.
[1:59:14] The grave was a scary thing. The
[1:59:15] afterlife was a scary thing. But because
[1:59:18] he overcame it, because he conquered it.
[1:59:21] Now God uses this really scary thing and
[1:59:24] he uses it for his glory and he
[1:59:26] harnesses us and he pulls us into his
[1:59:29] presence. What is it? What does the
[1:59:31] Bible say about the death of his saints?
[1:59:35] Precious precious in the eyes of the
[1:59:37] Lord is the death of his saints.
[1:59:40] Why? Because now they're in his
[1:59:42] presence. Amen.
[1:59:45] Amen.
[1:59:46] The true Easter seal 1961. Now we find
[1:59:50] no seal could hold him. He come forth.
[1:59:53] God broke the seal. The seal of the
[1:59:55] tomb. Broke the seal of death. Broke the
[1:59:56] seal of hell. Broke the seal of the
[1:59:58] grave. Do you think in his first res his
[2:00:00] first crucifixion, he broke the seals?
[2:00:04] Or Brandon said he did. Listen to these
[2:00:06] seals that he broke. I didn't give this
[2:00:08] to the brothers. I'm sorry.
[2:00:11] He broke the seal of the grave and came
[2:00:13] forth triumph. What did it? That great
[2:00:15] seal that was on the inside of him. They
[2:00:18] could destroy the body, but they could
[2:00:19] never destroy that seal. God gave the
[2:00:22] church a seal then that could never be
[2:00:24] destroyed. When they destroyed Abel, he
[2:00:26] raised up Seth. When they destroyed one
[2:00:28] prophet there, raised up another, they
[2:00:31] kept destroying. But God gave them
[2:00:32] something then that they cannot destroy.
[2:00:35] It's a supernatural spirit. It's the
[2:00:37] Holy Ghost itself. And it's infallible
[2:00:40] and it's imperishable. It cannot be
[2:00:43] destroyed. It'll live on and on and on.
[2:00:45] And because he lives, we live with him.
[2:00:48] Because we are sealed into the body of
[2:00:50] the Lord Jesus Christ. No way, no way to
[2:00:53] ever be destroyed, cannot perish, but
[2:00:55] has eternal life. Amen. God's great
[2:00:58] ripping of them seals. Amen.
[2:01:03] So, brother Brandham says, "I indict
[2:01:05] this generation for the second
[2:01:08] crucifixion of Christ." What was going
[2:01:10] on in the first crucifixion of Christ?
[2:01:12] Well, because of their creeds and dogmas
[2:01:14] and ideas of men, what were they doing?
[2:01:17] They were whipping him. They were
[2:01:18] saying, "He's not the same yesterday,
[2:01:20] today, and forever. He can't do it
[2:01:22] today. That was just for the apostles."
[2:01:24] That's the spirit that was on the people
[2:01:26] of that day. They were whipping him by
[2:01:29] neglecting the
[2:01:30] word. He's not the same. He's not a
[2:01:33] healer. The Holy Ghost is not for you.
[2:01:35] Everything's not.
[2:01:37] And then we see that they nailed him to
[2:01:39] the cross and there was darkness about a
[2:01:42] space of three hours in the middle of
[2:01:44] the day. His first crucifixion there was
[2:01:47] darkness. His second crucifixion there's
[2:01:49] darkness. The darkness is upon the earth
[2:01:52] and gross darkness is upon the people.
[2:01:56] Brother Brandham said that gross
[2:01:57] darkness is worldlyism creeping into the
[2:02:00] church, creeping into our lives,
[2:02:03] creeping into our homes. I say let's
[2:02:05] kick the darkness out with the light of
[2:02:07] the word. I say let's kick worldliness
[2:02:10] out with the light of the world word.
[2:02:14] Let's kick our TVs out. Whatever you
[2:02:17] have that's in your home that shouldn't
[2:02:19] be there. Let's apply the word. Apply
[2:02:21] the token and get it out of there. Amen.
[2:02:25] There was darkness. There's darkness
[2:02:27] now. Hallelujah.
[2:02:30] We see that there was seals that were
[2:02:33] beginning to break in his first
[2:02:35] crucifixion. The seal of the seal of
[2:02:38] death, the seal of hell, the seal of
[2:02:42] that Satan had upon the people. These
[2:02:44] seals now were beginning to break. Yeah.
[2:02:47] And as he rose from the dead, uh, seals
[2:02:50] were just breaking all over the place.
[2:02:52] There was not only seals that were
[2:02:54] breaking in the time of the first
[2:02:56] crucifixion, but there was mysteries
[2:02:57] that were being unfolded. The mystery of
[2:03:00] the bride in spirit form that was
[2:03:02] already in him that she was released
[2:03:04] there at Calvary. The spirit, the spirit
[2:03:07] of the bride, the the the the mystery of
[2:03:11] the bride being one with the bridegroom.
[2:03:14] Seals, mysteries being unfolded. What do
[2:03:17] we have in this day? Amen. Seals,
[2:03:21] mysteries being unfolded right before
[2:03:23] our very eyes
[2:03:26] that now we are one with Christ.
[2:03:30] Thank you, Lord. You see the parallel as
[2:03:33] the musicians
[2:03:34] come, we'll bring this to a close.
[2:03:37] That's why brother Brandham could say,
[2:03:39] "I indict it." How could he indict it?
[2:03:42] Because the word was made flesh in its
[2:03:45] fullness right before their very eyes.
[2:03:50] In the sermon, it is the rising of the
[2:03:52] sun. Paragraph 51. The trinity of the
[2:03:55] devil, death, hell, and the grave. For
[2:03:57] Satan is the author of death. He is the
[2:04:00] possessor of hell and also the grave.
[2:04:02] And that was the trinity of Satan being
[2:04:04] caused by one thing and that was death.
[2:04:07] Death. you go at the grave and uh and
[2:04:11] being a sinner, you go to hell. All the
[2:04:14] very one thing, the trinity of Satan,
[2:04:16] which was death, that had held man in
[2:04:18] captivity all these years. But now, the
[2:04:20] true trinity of God being one,
[2:04:22] manifested in Christ, who was life. See,
[2:04:25] one brings death, but the other one
[2:04:27] brings life. They both have a trinity,
[2:04:29] but they're both one. I want to choose
[2:04:32] life this morning.
[2:04:34] Amen. But now the true trinity of God
[2:04:37] being one manifested in Christ who was
[2:04:40] life and had broke the seals and
[2:04:42] conquered the enemy rose up the one true
[2:04:44] and living God. I am he that was dead
[2:04:46] and I'm alive forever more and have the
[2:04:48] keys of death and hell. Uh the God in
[2:04:52] one made man and dwelt among us and
[2:04:55] conquered every enemy and had proved
[2:04:57] that the trinity of Satan was conquered.
[2:05:00] Hallelujah. and that the trinity of God
[2:05:02] was made known because only God alone
[2:05:04] had power to bring life back again. He
[2:05:07] was that Emanuel. God had been
[2:05:09] manifested in the flesh. No wonder he
[2:05:11] could claim there Matthew the 27th
[2:05:13] chapter. All powers in heaven and earth
[2:05:15] has given into my hand. I send you to be
[2:05:18] my witnesses to all the world. He had
[2:05:20] conquered both death, hell, and the
[2:05:21] grave. Not only did he do that and come
[2:05:23] out triumph with all the power in
[2:05:25] heavens and earth. All that was the
[2:05:27] Father, all that was the Holy Ghost and
[2:05:29] all that there ever was was in him. All
[2:05:32] powers in heaven and in earth is given
[2:05:34] onto me. Everything else is powerless.
[2:05:39] He had conquered.
[2:05:41] [Music]
[2:05:46] So
[2:05:47] death is powerless.
[2:05:50] Why is it powerless? Cuz he conquered
[2:05:52] it. Hell is
[2:05:55] powerless. Why is it powerless? Because
[2:05:58] he conquered it. The grave is powerless.
[2:06:01] Why is it power? Because he conquered
[2:06:02] it. Sickness is conquered. Amen. The
[2:06:06] powers that Satan has upon our life,
[2:06:08] guess what, my brother, my sister?
[2:06:10] They're conquered. Amen. Why? Because he
[2:06:14] defeated it at Calvary. He defeated it
[2:06:17] when he rose from the dead. Oh, what a
[2:06:19] mighty God that we serve this morning. A
[2:06:22] God that that would take our shame and
[2:06:24] take our guilt and take our sin and take
[2:06:27] it to the cross. And he would rise
[2:06:28] again. Why would he do these things?
[2:06:30] Because he was constrained with love.
[2:06:33] Because there would be a people down
[2:06:35] seven church down through seven church
[2:06:37] ages who would be a redeemable person.
[2:06:40] And so here he would perform the act of
[2:06:43] kinsman redeemer knowing that there was
[2:06:45] a people who would be in need of
[2:06:47] redemption and not only in need of
[2:06:49] redemption had the ability
[2:06:52] yes to be
[2:06:56] redeemed. Somebody give the Lord a hand
[2:06:59] clap of praise this morning. Let's stand
[2:07:00] to our feet.
[2:07:02] [Music]
[2:07:04] How can I be redee? Why am I redeemed?
[2:07:07] It's because I'm redeemable.
[2:07:10] Because I am bone of his bone and flesh
[2:07:13] of his flesh. I'm part of this great
[2:07:15] family and mystery of God in this end
[2:07:18] time. Oh, thank God. Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:21] Let's just sing this song together here.
[2:07:32] Lord, verse five. Verse one. Finally
[2:07:35] became sin.
[2:07:37] Oh, he became
[2:07:39] sin who knew no
[2:07:42] sin that we might
[2:07:46] become his
[2:07:49] rightousness. He humbled
[2:07:52] himself and carry their
[2:07:57] cross. Love so
[2:08:03] amazing. Love so amazing.
[2:08:09] Amazing Jesus Messiah.
