[37:31] left now for crying.
[37:34] It's a shame to complain. [singing]
[37:38] You've got to kick the devil off of your

[38:42] You are equipped [singing and music]
[38:44] to fight this battle.
[38:47] Even though it is the [singing] Lord's,
[38:51] prayer is a mighty weapon.
[38:55] The weakest Christian can take hold.
[38:57] [music and singing]
[38:59] Prayer makes the demons tremble,
[39:02] [singing] but it puts God in control.
[39:05] [music]
[39:07] Little by little,
[39:10] you shall win [singing and music] every
[39:12] battle.
[39:14] Oh, little by little, you will conquer
[39:19] every [singing] foe. Oh my God will set
[39:23] his boundaries all [singing and music]
[39:26] around you. They will stretch from sea
[39:30] to sea and little by [singing] little
[39:33] you'll gain the [music] victory.
[39:38] My God will set his boundaries all
[39:42] [music] around you. [singing]
[39:44] They will stretch from sea to sea. And
[39:48] little by [music and singing] little,

[40:15] victory, you are more than a conqueror
[40:19] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; On your own, we're nothing. I'm nothing
[40:24] on my own. But through the blood of
[40:26] Jesus Christ, we are conquerors. [music]
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; What's your need this morning? Give it
[40:32] to the mighty conqueror cuz he's here to
[40:35] fight your battle today. Amen.
[40:40] And we can make [singing and music] more
[40:43] than coner
[40:48] overs

[40:54] And we've been made [music and singing]
[40:56] victorious
[41:01] all through the blood of Jesus. Do you
[41:04] believe it? Lift your hand and sing it
[41:06] this morning. that we've been made more
[41:10] than a [music and singing] consequence.
[41:18] [music]
[41:23] [music and singing]
[41:29] [singing]
[41:30] [music]
[41:34] As brother comes this morning, healer of
[41:37] the broken [music] pieces,
[41:43] you touch my heart and make me
[41:46] [singing and music] new.
[41:50] Oh, now my whole life, my surrender, I

[42:12] to where you are. [music]
[42:17] Oh, [singing] now [music] I live to
[42:20] praise you. Oh me, how great you believe
[42:24] it this morning. Lift your hand [music]
[42:27] and ask the healer to touch your knee
[42:29] today. Healer. Healer of the broken

[42:37] You touched my heart and made me.
[42:40] [music]
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Oh now [music and singing] my whole life
[42:46] I surrender. I lay down before the
[42:50] vendor. [music] Lord I give my heart to
[42:53] you.

[43:06] you are. [music]
[43:12] Now [music] I live to praise you.
[43:15] Every day I praise you,
[43:19] healer of my [singing]
[43:21] heart. [music]
[43:25] Heavenly Father,
[43:28] that's more than a song.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; It is a reality.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; We look back in our lives and we can see
[43:37] how that we were broken.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; We were dysfunctional.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Without God,
[43:44] without hope.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; But you placed a call upon our lives,
[43:49] Father, before the foundation of the
[43:51] world.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. that at some time, at
[43:54] some place, at some hour,
[43:57] we would hear thy voice
[44:00] and there would be a deep calling to the
[44:02] deep. And there would be a deep inside
[44:04] of each one that would respond to that
[44:07] calling.
[44:09] Therefore, Father, we are here this
[44:10] morning to re report for duty, to
[44:14] respond to that calling
[44:16] &gt;&gt; and to thank you, Father, for all that
[44:19] you've done,
[44:20] &gt;&gt; for all that you are doing and for all
[44:23] that you will do.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; We praise you and we thank you. Come and
[44:27] anoint the word to our hearts this
[44:29] morning and use your servant to speak to
[44:33] your people. I ask for your glory in
[44:36] Jesus Christ's name.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless. You can all be
[44:43] seated for just a moment. Just a moment.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Have a uh something that's on my heart
[44:51] here and uh just wanted to just share
[44:54] some things with you and stuff. And I
[44:56] wanted to make it clear because
[44:58] somebody's been asking me uh brother
[45:00] Martin Malumba, he why has he not been
[45:02] preaching? Well, he asked he's very very
[45:04] busy with his work schedule and said,
[45:07] "Brother Ron, uh, keep me off of the
[45:09] schedule until January 1." So, uh, hang
[45:12] on January 1, uh, after that, he's
[45:16] putting the line up again. And so, that
[45:18] was his request. And, uh, so just be
[45:21] patient with that. And, Brother Mark
[45:24] Stkey's parents,
[45:26] uh, his mother, I should say, and his
[45:28] stepfather are streaming the service
[45:31] this morning. And I thought I'd take a
[45:33] moment and say hello to Evelyn and John
[45:35] Malik. They're up uh in Colona,
[45:39] um British Columbia. And so we greet
[45:41] them in the name of the Lord. I trust
[45:43] that the service will be a great
[45:45] blessing for them.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Um as you all know that uh I'm going to
[45:50] be having a heart procedure here in the
[45:52] next couple weeks, but there's also one
[45:55] among us who's having an issue also. And
[45:58] I'd like brother Neil M to come up here
[46:00] at this time to kind of tell us uh what
[46:03] he's going through. And then I want all
[46:04] of us to be praying for him. And when I
[46:07] ask the brethren to come forward, I'd
[46:10] like my deacons, associate ministers, uh
[46:13] I'd like all of you to come forward,
[46:15] even brother Paul Love and uh different
[46:19] ones there if they would come uh to pray
[46:22] for our brother Neil. Come on up here,
[46:24] brother Neil.
[46:26] very special friend of ours. We know
[46:30] that God I call him the miracle man.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; So anyway, he went the other day and
[46:42] went to his doctor and he he got a
[46:45] report. So we want to go ahead and have
[46:48] him to bring it to you. Brother Neil,
[46:50] God bless you, my friend.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Hello everyone. I do want to thank
[46:53] everybody for your continued praying for
[46:55] me and situation I'm going through.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Let's get this way. They can hear you a
[47:01] little bit better.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Test.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's strange to be on the other
[47:05] end of one of these.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Um
[47:09] I went to the doctor the other day and
[47:11] they did their annual scan of my heart
[47:14] and and a and a ultrasound and with the
[47:18] contrast and everything. Well, I I have
[47:21] developed what they call a false lumen.
[47:24] And if anybody knows the medical
[47:25] profession, you know what that is. The
[47:27] blood in my artery has channeled and
[47:29] went through it through the area where I
[47:31] had my tear. And so I looked at the
[47:35] complications of it and you know what's
[47:37] the surgery? Well, the surgery is very
[47:38] very complex since I had a type A aortic
[47:42] dissection. And um having said that, I
[47:45] would just like you to keep me in my
[47:47] prayer because it's it's I go in
[47:49] tomorrow and have another test done to
[47:51] see exactly what they're going to do. So
[47:54] I I don't know. But I basically I feel
[47:57] like a walking time bomb. It's just, you
[48:00] know, it's dilated like 5 centimeters
[48:03] right now. So and if you don't know what
[48:06] that is, it's like two inches. So
[48:09] anyway, I thank you very much for your
[48:11] prayers and you continue support for me.
[48:14] So that's uh that's the the latest on
[48:17] that. Brother Ron, if you want so say a
[48:20] few words.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you just stay right up here
[48:24] and let me put this back here. Put that
[48:27] in there. You brethren, come on up here
[48:30] behind the
[48:32] the pulpit here with me.
[48:46] And the reason that this is a very very
[48:49] serious situation is because he's
[48:52] already had aortic dissection. You know,
[48:54] it's caused his feet to get amputated,
[48:57] the ends of his fingers, that sort of
[48:59] thing, and and everything.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[49:01] &gt;&gt; the doctors. I remember when this first
[49:03] happened, the aortic dissection and you
[49:06] know the lifeflight and all of the
[49:09] complications.
[49:10] Uh I remember that we going to the
[49:14] hospital talking to his surgeon
[49:17] and u I said well doctor what is the
[49:20] prognosis? What are we going to do? You
[49:22] know uh are you know and he said well we
[49:27] really don't know what to do. We going
[49:28] to let nature take its course because
[49:31] I've never had anyone live beyond a
[49:34] couple two three days with what he had.
[49:37] So he already broke medical science
[49:41] &gt;&gt; and I believe he's going to break it
[49:43] again.
[49:45] [applause]
[49:48] &gt;&gt; I do. [cheering]
[49:50] &gt;&gt; I have that confidence. Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Our God is a mighty God.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; He is. He's a mighty God. And he's of
[49:58] He's a healer of the broken pieces.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; I mean, if he wanted to take you home,
[50:03] he'd already taken you home.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Why put you all through this?
[50:08] &gt;&gt; But nevertheless, God is God and we
[50:12] worship him. Amen.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; And we are here, my brother, to lay our
[50:18] hands on you and ask you
[50:21] to have faith in God.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Let's gather together. Get in here
[50:33] close. You brother.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, as I lay my hands upon
[50:41] our brother Neil M.
[50:46] Oh God,
[50:49] &gt;&gt; you're a mighty God.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; You're an everpresent help in the time
[50:53] of need.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; And we bring this need before you, oh
[50:57] Father.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; We claim a victory before the battle.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; You're the mighty conqueror. You're the
[51:05] mighty healer. Our breath is in your
[51:08] hands. Oh God, I bring brother Neil
[51:11] before you. And the doctors, they
[51:14] doctor, they do what they do. But you're
[51:17] the mighty healer. You that have kept
[51:19] him in days past are the same God that
[51:23] will keep him in the future. Therefore,
[51:26] Father, we claim a victory and we we lay
[51:30] our hands upon him right now and ask,
[51:34] Father, so let it be written. So let it
[51:37] be done. May he be healed.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; May, father, even perhaps they go and do
[51:42] the test TOMORROW AND SAY, "WHAT
[51:45] HAPPENED?
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Something's happened."
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. You're the same yesterday,
[51:51] today, and forever.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; You're the great heart surgeon. Father,
[51:55] we commit our brother Neil to you. We
[51:58] claim this victory now as we lay our
[52:00] hands upon him for your glory in the
[52:03] name of Jesus Christ. May this test be
[52:07] turned into a testimony.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Thank you, brother. God
[52:20] bless you, Rich.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Ah, yeah, you guys can. You can pray for
[52:24] me while you're here. Hey, Mike, come
[52:27] on. You guys, uh,
[52:29] Brother Stephen,
[52:33] he's already there. He's already at his
[52:35] seat and everything. Listen, I I
[52:37] realize, you know, look, the doctors are
[52:40] saying calcification of your aortic
[52:42] valve and they need to replace it and
[52:44] everything like that, but listen, I'm
[52:46] not nervous. Concerned? Yes. Nervous?
[52:48] No. Because everything is in his hands.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; So, uh, Amos says, "Well, we're here.
[52:55] Why don't we pray for you?"
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[52:58] &gt;&gt; What does hinder? So, would you And
[53:00] Amos, you go ahead if you would.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[53:07] &gt;&gt; you said that all things are possible.
[53:10] Father, if we would just believe.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; He does not believe in our own power,
[53:14] our own strength, Father. Lord,
[53:16] &gt;&gt; but Lord, we're believing in your word,
[53:18] Lord. You said that where two or three
[53:20] are gathered in your name, Lord, that
[53:22] there you would be in our midst, Father.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; And then if we would just trust you,
[53:26] Lord. The Bible says we have not because
[53:28] we ask not, and we ask not because we
[53:29] trust not. But Lord, we trust you in all
[53:32] things, Father. given our bodies our
[53:34] healing. These bodies are frail, Lord.
[53:37] They're temporal, Lord. But Lord, you're
[53:39] eternal, Father. And you know that we
[53:41] still have things that we want to
[53:43] achieve for your kingdom here.
[53:46] Lord,
[53:47] &gt;&gt; our pastor, Father,
[53:48] &gt;&gt; give him strength, Father. Give him new
[53:51] heart, Father.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Not one not made by hands, but Lord,
[53:54] made by you. Father, we love you. We
[53:57] pray that you'd restore him 100%,
[53:59] Father. will be certain. We give you all
[54:01] the glory and
[54:03] &gt;&gt; we love you in Jesus name.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. Thank you.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. God bless you. God
[54:10] bless you richly. God bless you.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:33] God bless you. God bless you.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[54:40] that if these earthly vessels be
[54:44] dissolved,
[54:45] &gt;&gt; we have another one.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Let's face it, the older you get, the
[54:50] more dissolving we have.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Whether it be your shoulders, your
[54:54] knees, your heart, your eyes, your ears,
[54:57] whatever. I thank God that I have
[54:59] another one waiting for me. Huh? And so,
[55:04] so it's not that we be unclothed. Paul
[55:07] said, "Not that I desire to be
[55:09] unclothed, but to be clothed upon."
[55:12] &gt;&gt; I tell you, we have the greatest victory
[55:16] laying ahead for the bride of Jesus
[55:18] Christ
[55:20] &gt;&gt; right now.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for it off in the
[55:24] future. I say it's happening now.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; This is the day.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; This is the time.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; This is our message.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand together this
[55:40] morning.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Let's sing. Only believe.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Only believe.
[55:46] Yes. Only [singing]
[55:49] believe.
[55:53] only
[55:55] [singing]
[55:56] [music]
[56:00] all things are [singing and music]
[56:02] possible.
[56:05] All we need, [music]
[56:11] oh, [singing]
[56:13] [music]
[56:17] all [singing]
[56:22] for all things are possible.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; [music]
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, that is our lot in
[56:36] life.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; You said if you would just believe.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; You didn't ask us to manufacture
[56:45] anything, to produce anything,
[56:48] &gt;&gt; but to confess in our hearts that we
[56:50] believe.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; And we say like that one in the
[56:54] scripture, Lord, I believe. Help thou my
[56:57] unbelief.
[56:58] But it is our lot in life, Father, that
[57:02] when we hear your word, we say yay and
[57:04] amen. There's something inside that
[57:07] predestinated elect seed that is called
[57:10] upon God to believe every word. And so
[57:15] therefore, Father, I pray, let us take
[57:18] our position among those that have down
[57:21] through the ages, the countless members
[57:25] of that elect seed that have been called
[57:27] in every age,
[57:30] by every voice,
[57:32] by every prophet,
[57:35] by every one, Lord, that was called by
[57:38] the name of Jehovah Gyra,
[57:42] Elohim. name.
[57:44] You have made yourself known in this
[57:46] hour.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; We are all recipients of a message
[57:52] &gt;&gt; where you answered this loudest and
[57:55] lukewarm age by fire.
[58:00] You speak from a pillar of fire.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Your voice
[58:06] &gt;&gt; follows that pillar of fire. Amen.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Let us enter into
[58:14] that anointing,
[58:16] &gt;&gt; that pillar of fire,
[58:19] &gt;&gt; that we be consumed
[58:22] &gt;&gt; by the power of God. I [snorts] ask it
[58:25] now for your glory. Bless each and
[58:27] everyone. The reading of thy word, oh
[58:29] God, I bless it.
[58:35] I bless it, Lord.
[58:38] Now bless it to the hearts of every
[58:39] believer in Jesus Christ's name.
[58:44] Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:49] Amen. God bless you this morning. Let's
[58:51] just remain standing. Thank you
[58:53] musicians. Amen. Each and every one the
[58:56] song specials. Hallelujah. We are
[58:59] becoming really a
[59:01] multicultural
[59:03] church.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; My from Spanish French and German and
[59:10] Norwegian and Spanglish and
[59:15] all kinds of languages here. Bundi
[59:19] and uh Kishwahili
[59:23] and so many different ones.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Some have asked me, brother Ron, what do
[59:28] you think we'll we'll speak in heaven?
[59:31] Well, I don't know,
[59:34] and I really don't care. All I know is
[59:36] that we'll be able to communicate one
[59:37] with another and you won't need a
[59:39] translator.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Won't that be wonderful?
[59:55] &gt;&gt; You know, years ago, I got to thinking
[59:57] how that language and having to talk is
[1:00:00] actually a hindrance. It's a hindrance
[1:00:03] to me. Sometimes I can't say what I'm
[1:00:06] feeling.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; I feel like my trying to explain it in
[1:00:10] verbiage.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; I'm hindered.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; And then I got to thinking, well, you
[1:00:16] know, if we travel like a thought, why
[1:00:19] can't we discern one another's thought?
[1:00:22] So we could just sit on a log next to
[1:00:25] one another, not even move our mouth,
[1:00:30] and all of a sudden, yeah, brother.
[1:00:32] Amen. That's the truth.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Communicating.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Telepathy.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; May God give us
[1:00:45] some telepathy.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; This morning. In other words,
[1:00:52] something
[1:00:55] that is supernatural. Amen.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Now, the brethren asked me this morning,
[1:01:01] they said, "Brother Ron, are you sure
[1:01:05] you sent all your notes?" Because you
[1:01:07] only got two pages of notes. Normally, I
[1:01:09] have five to eight.
[1:01:12] And then I got to worrying. I thought,
[1:01:14] man, maybe I didn't got to checking.
[1:01:17] Yeah, I did. I only sent two pages of
[1:01:20] notes, but the notes are in here right
[1:01:23] now.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Okay. And I have something on my heart
[1:01:27] and I wish to be able to take my time
[1:01:29] because this is extremely serious and I
[1:01:34] wish to project that to you because if
[1:01:37] it remains just something on my heart
[1:01:39] and it's not transferred to you, how do
[1:01:42] you know what we're talking about? The
[1:01:43] trumpet gives an uncertain sound. So, we
[1:01:46] want to have a certain sound
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; that speaks. May the voice
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; as he's quickening me
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; speak to you because
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; I believe that this is for us.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; I do.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it's for us.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy chapter 4 and then Hebrews
[1:02:12] chapter 12.
[1:02:15] Deuteronomy chapter 4
[1:02:18] verses 23-
[1:02:20] 24.
[1:02:29] [snorts]
[1:02:34] Deuteronomy 4:23. Take heed unto
[1:02:37] yourselves,
[1:02:39] lest you forget the covenant of the Lord
[1:02:41] your God,
[1:02:44] which he made with you,
[1:02:48] [snorts] and make you a graven, and make
[1:02:51] you a gro graven image, or likeness of
[1:02:54] anything which the Lord thy God hath
[1:02:56] forbidden thee.
[1:03:00] For the Lord thy God
[1:03:03] is a consuming fire,
[1:03:07] even a jealous God.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; For the Lord thy God
[1:03:16] is a consuming fire,
[1:03:20] even a jealous God.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he's jealous of you?
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:28] Thank you Lord.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Even the Apostle Paul says
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; I am
[1:03:37] concerned about you with a godly
[1:03:39] jealousy.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; For I fear
[1:03:44] less by any means
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; that serpent which beguiled Eve in the
[1:03:50] beginning will come and take away from
[1:03:52] your simplicity which is in Christ.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before
[1:03:58] the prophet opened the opening of the
[1:04:00] seven seals, he preached a sermon.
[1:04:03] God revealed
[1:04:06] in simplicity.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; It's not complex.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; But he reveals himself in simplicity.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 12:es 23- 29.
[1:04:22] [snorts]
[1:04:28] Hebrews 12
[1:04:33] verse 23
[1:04:36] [snorts] to the general assembly
[1:04:39] and church of the firstborn. Notice who
[1:04:42] he's addressing it to.
[1:04:45] This is not to everybody.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the general assembly
[1:04:52] and the church of the firstborn
[1:04:56] which are written in heaven.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Where'd you come from?
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Where are you going?
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; And to God the judge of all and to the
[1:05:10] spirits of just men made perfect.
[1:05:15] and to Jesus the mediator of the new
[1:05:17] covenant
[1:05:19] and to the blood of sprinkling
[1:05:22] that speaketh better things than that of
[1:05:25] Abel.
[1:05:30] See that you refuse not him that
[1:05:33] speaketh.
[1:05:35] For if they escape not
[1:05:38] who refused him who spake on earth,
[1:05:42] much more shall not we escape if we turn
[1:05:45] away from him that speaketh from heaven.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Whose voice then shook the earth?
[1:05:52] But now he promised, saying, "Yet once
[1:05:56] more I shake not the earth only, but
[1:05:59] also heaven." Amen.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Everything
[1:06:03] is getting shook
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; from earthly to heavenly.
[1:06:09] And this word
[1:06:12] yet once more signifyth the removing of
[1:06:15] all those things that are shaken
[1:06:18] as of things that are made that those
[1:06:21] things which cannot be shaken
[1:06:24] may remain.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:27] Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[1:06:29] cannot be moved,
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; let us have grace,
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; whereby we may serve God acceptably
[1:06:38] with reverence and godly fear.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; For our God is a consuming fire.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; May God add the blessing to the reading
[1:06:50] of his word. You may be seated this
[1:06:51] morning in his presence.
[1:06:54] [snorts]
[1:06:59] Now, I have been meditating for several
[1:07:02] weeks now,
[1:07:04] going out
[1:07:07] into my backyard
[1:07:10] or into my prayer closet.
[1:07:13] Sometimes waking up in the middle of
[1:07:15] night, getting out of my bed, sitting on
[1:07:18] my chair,
[1:07:20] and just meditating.
[1:07:25] and seeking the mind of God.
[1:07:32] And
[1:07:33] there's a subject
[1:07:36] that has come to my attention even while
[1:07:39] my wife and I were reading in the seven
[1:07:42] church age book
[1:07:45] concerning the subject of the cycle
[1:07:50] of revival and death that brother
[1:07:53] Brennham said never fails.
[1:07:55] It happens in every age.
[1:08:01] So every age has had its movement of
[1:08:04] God. Every time throughout history of
[1:08:07] seeing God from Genesis 1 all the way
[1:08:11] through,
[1:08:12] we see this revival cycle that's
[1:08:17] happening. And then something comes in,
[1:08:20] compromises it, it dies down, and then
[1:08:23] God comes and brings another one. the
[1:08:26] cycle of revival and death that he said
[1:08:30] never ceases,
[1:08:32] [snorts]
[1:08:34] what caused it,
[1:08:38] how can we combat against it?
[1:08:43] Because certainly, I don't know about
[1:08:45] you, but I as a minister and as a pastor
[1:08:52] am seeing it not only globally
[1:08:56] Now I want to focus not about those out
[1:09:00] there but I want to talk about us and
[1:09:04] when I say us I'm all inclusive of
[1:09:08] message believers who embrace this end
[1:09:11] time message as their own.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:15] that we can see and as brother Brennham
[1:09:18] tells us that you watch the revival
[1:09:21] comes there's a messenger God sends to
[1:09:24] him a message and those that hear it
[1:09:28] that were quickened during the time of
[1:09:31] that messenger
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; their first generation
[1:09:36] I didn't come to the message until 1971
[1:09:39] six years after the messenger had
[1:09:42] already gone off the scene and yet it
[1:09:44] was still so fresh
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; and how the message believers around the
[1:09:51] world. Why I tell you there were people
[1:09:54] traveling and getting in buses and on
[1:09:57] cars and they would travel together to
[1:10:00] go just to hear about what God had done
[1:10:04] in this hour and many witnesses
[1:10:08] all over the world were having uh um
[1:10:12] meetings and they were witnesses. I was
[1:10:14] a witness of what God has done in this
[1:10:17] day.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; And I can say as a young brother, I was
[1:10:24] in awe
[1:10:25] to meet the ones that were there. What
[1:10:29] was it like
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; when you went to the meetings and you
[1:10:35] saw the prophet of God
[1:10:38] and how he spoke
[1:10:42] and What was the atmosphere?
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO BE there
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; to hear the Elijah?
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; I never met him though. I've had him
[1:11:03] come to me in several dreams.
[1:11:06] [snorts]
[1:11:07] So, I'm part of second generation.
[1:11:14] My children are third generation. My
[1:11:17] grandchildren are fourth.
[1:11:20] And brother Brennan talks about he said
[1:11:22] you watch that first generation
[1:11:24] and then the second and then the third
[1:11:28] until the fourth generation. He said
[1:11:31] there's just a small bit of the embers
[1:11:36] of the original fire left. Amen.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; But I want to say and declare unto all
[1:11:42] of you today that I do not want to
[1:11:45] accept
[1:11:47] a dying revival.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; I will declare to you that this which is
[1:11:59] begun in me
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; is consuming.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; It's greater now. The revelation to it
[1:12:08] is greater now to me THAN WHEN I FIRST
[1:12:11] EMBRACED IT.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S UNFOLDING GREATER and greater.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; The scripture along with the message of
[1:12:22] the hour as revelation and illumination
[1:12:26] COMES TO MY SOUL.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; IT IS SO GRIPPING.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:35] AND I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND
[1:12:38] THAT THIS WHAT GOD HAS DONE IN THIS
[1:12:40] HOUR.
[1:12:42] It was not done in a corner
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; IN SOME MYSTERIOUS LITTLE SOMETHING
[1:12:49] SOMEWHERE.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; BUT HE SENT THIS MESSENGER
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; AS A WITNESS
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; SEVEN TIMES AROUND THE WORLD.
[1:13:01] And he said, "As Moses was given two
[1:13:03] signs,
[1:13:05] you and your ministry shall be given two
[1:13:07] signs." But he said, "That only gets the
[1:13:09] attraction."
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; That's not the vindication of your
[1:13:13] ministry.
[1:13:15] He said, "Yes, God has called me to pray
[1:13:17] for the sick, but he says, I want you to
[1:13:19] know."
[1:13:21] But he says, "That is only the the bait
[1:13:24] that's on the hook."
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "The hook
[1:13:30] is the word revealed
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; in its season.
[1:13:39] You might have saw or heard about this
[1:13:43] ministry, this God vindicated ministry
[1:13:46] and you like a fish to come by and you
[1:13:50] got a little something and maybe a good
[1:13:52] fisherman, he he kind of jerks the line
[1:13:55] and he causes that and the fish, they're
[1:13:58] attracted by movement
[1:14:02] and Maybe you just kind of passed by.
[1:14:06] Maybe it drew your attention. It had an
[1:14:09] attraction to you and you come by and
[1:14:12] you just I wonder what's that come by.
[1:14:17] Oh, God is a healer. He's the same
[1:14:19] yesterday, today, and forever. Oh,
[1:14:22] little nibble, nibble, nibble, and
[1:14:24] everything. Now, any good fisherman sits
[1:14:26] there and he says, "Oh, oh, oh, look,
[1:14:29] look, watch the
[1:14:34] Now, any good fisherman knows when the
[1:14:36] first nibble, don't jerk the hook.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; No, let him take it.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; God did not jerk the hook.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Until you took it.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Hook,
[1:14:53] line, and sink.
[1:14:57] That's right.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; You swallowed it. It wasn't just a lip.
[1:15:01] It wasn't you swimming by and it got one
[1:15:04] of your fins,
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; but it hooked you.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Then no matter how much you fought,
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; God will not lose one of you.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:23] Now, contrary to
[1:15:26] [snorts]
[1:15:28] you thinking that it's going to be
[1:15:29] something you do to get you there, it's
[1:15:32] not.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; He made a covenant
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. In
[1:15:39] fact, HE WROTE YOUR NAMES.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. on the lamb's book of life before
[1:15:44] the foundation of the WORLD BEFORE YOU
[1:15:46] WERE BORN BEFORE THERE WAS STARDUST God
[1:15:50] has got an elect seed that HE SAID IS
[1:15:52] PREDESTINATED
[1:15:54] TO hear
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; you say well don't I have a part to play
[1:16:04] in this yes you do
[1:16:08] but is God who reveals to you your
[1:16:10] heart.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Now out there, let me say this to
[1:16:16] nonseed
[1:16:20] to what brother Brennham declares as the
[1:16:23] seed of the serpent. He said in nonseed
[1:16:27] there is nothing to quicken.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus when he was here he said you are
[1:16:33] of your father the devil and his works
[1:16:38] you will do. Amen.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; So understand that there are there is a
[1:16:44] whole another race of people
[1:16:47] that are out there that you rub
[1:16:49] shoulders with every day.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Whether it's at work, at bank, at
[1:16:54] school,
[1:16:55] or wherever.
[1:16:59] And they do not see what you see.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; They do not hear what you hear.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; In fact, you're
[1:17:07] a foreigner.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; You are as alien to their understanding
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; as somebody who is from another kingdom.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "My kingdom
[1:17:29] is not of this world.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; If it were, I would have fought."
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Sure. I want all of you to understand
[1:17:37] that this kingdom
[1:17:39] that we're talking about is not just
[1:17:42] some
[1:17:44] far away place.
[1:17:48] Brother Brennham said that when the
[1:17:50] rapture takes place, are we going to go
[1:17:53] past that wide far away Milky Way
[1:17:58] at light speed?
[1:18:02] He said, "No." He said, "Actually,
[1:18:04] you're just only changing dimensions."
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:18:13] may I take liberty to just expound on
[1:18:17] that for just a moment? Amen.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said, "Science has
[1:18:22] proved
[1:18:23] that there are voices,
[1:18:26] there are images,
[1:18:29] there are things that are passing right
[1:18:31] through this room right now."
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; And he said, "You just have to have a
[1:18:40] crystal
[1:18:42] or something that's magnetized to catch
[1:18:45] that image." He said, "That's all
[1:18:47] television does
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; is you have to have a receptor."
[1:18:52] Huh?
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Or your cell phone has to be under the
[1:18:56] cloud or in the footprint. YOU GOT TO
[1:18:58] HAVE FIVE BARS.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; You understand? Can you hear me now?
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Now
[1:19:09] I can prove to you that there's voices
[1:19:12] passing through here right now."
[1:19:15] Brother Brennham said if science knew
[1:19:18] what to look for,
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; he said Jesus when he spoke the words,
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; he said if they knew what to do, he said
[1:19:26] just like a uh a pebble dropped into a
[1:19:29] brook and it sends the rippled waves.
[1:19:31] And all of you have seen that.
[1:19:34] He said that they would be able to go
[1:19:37] out
[1:19:38] into the waves of eternity
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; and they would catch up and know that
[1:19:44] right here at this place they would hear
[1:19:45] the words of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to KNOW THAT THE VOICE OF
[1:19:53] God
[1:19:56] is something very supernatural.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. [snorts]
[1:20:03] Jesus said, "The words that I speak unto
[1:20:06] you, they are spirit and they are life."
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; So all of you understand that
[1:20:18] when God gives to you revelation,
[1:20:23] do you know what he's doing?
[1:20:26] He's sending you a signal that you have
[1:20:30] a receptor within you.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; You can't deny it.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND IT. YOU
[1:20:38] MIGHT EVEN DISAGREE with it. You, you
[1:20:40] know, listen,
[1:20:42] it's not that YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
[1:20:44] EVERYTHING
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU WON'T. WITH THIS LITTLE
[1:20:47] FINITE MIND, IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO know
[1:20:51] what's going on in this world, much less
[1:20:53] what the heavenly kingdom is doing.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HIS WAYS ARE ABOVE MY WAYS.
[1:20:58] HIS THOUGHTS ARE ABOVE MY THOUGHTS.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; SO UNTIL I GET MY UPGRADE,
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; at the first resurrection, LISTEN, ALL
[1:21:08] I'VE got is the earnest.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; I got the down payment, which is the
[1:21:13] Holy Spirit. BUT ON THAT FIRST
[1:21:16] RESURRECTION, HALLELUJAH, THE PROPHET OF
[1:21:18] GOD SAID THAT EARNEST WILL BECOME a
[1:21:21] fullness.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Until then, we fight.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; We wrestle
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; with thoughts
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; and carnalities and and education and
[1:21:36] science AND HOW WILL IT BE.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; GOD don't have to tell you
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; how it'll be. It will be.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; That's his business.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know how we're going TO GET
[1:21:49] RAPTURED. I DON'T KNOW how
[1:21:52] how it's going TO HAPPEN. ALL I KNOW IS
[1:21:54] IT'S HAPPENING.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU, IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT
[1:21:59] NOW.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; I'm being changed.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; How about you? Are you caught up in
[1:22:06] something?
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Well, let me tell you, this that began
[1:22:09] to work in you is going to GO UNTIL
[1:22:11] YOU'RE COMPLETELY CHANGED. AMEN.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. UNTIL YOU BECOME.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; YOU SAID, BROTHER RAM SAID, WATCH.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; HE SAID ENOCH WAS NOT BECAUSE GOD TOOK
[1:22:22] HIM AND HE SAID ENOCH STEPPED INTO his
[1:22:27] revelation
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; when you come to church
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; and God gives you revelation
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; FOR THAT MILLISECOND.
[1:22:39] HOWEVER, IN A BRIEF MOMENT OF TIME, YOU
[1:22:42] ARE JETTISONED.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; INTO HEAVENLY PLACES.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And it has SUCH A QUICKENING POWER. YOU
[1:22:49] GO, MY IF I COULD JUST STAY IN THAT
[1:22:52] PRESENCE.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; One day
[1:23:00] you will.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Can't wait.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. I can't wait.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; But be patient
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; because he will do it.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; He that made the covenant will fulfill
[1:23:18] it.
[1:23:20] So you have a receptor inside of you
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; that when he sent a voice
[1:23:27] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:23:29] angel when he should begin to sound
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; there was a receptor inside of you
[1:23:36] that was catching not the voice of
[1:23:39] William
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Brham.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Let me declare unto you, you are hearing
[1:23:46] a voice from THE PILLAR OF FIRE. AMEN.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE PILLAR OF FIRE COME DOWN
[1:23:52] ONCE AGAIN BECAUSE THE GOD THAT ANSWERS
[1:23:54] BY FIRE, LET HIM BE GOD.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; SO GOD HAD TO SEND DOWN A PILLAR OF FIRE
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; TO COMBAT AGAINST the lukewarm
[1:24:05] DENOMINATIONAL
[1:24:08] SPIRITS,
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; religious spirits, Catholic spirits,
[1:24:12] DENOMINATIONAL SPIRITS.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:24:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; And he captivated you.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; You've been caught up. That word caught
[1:24:27] up in a moment, in the twinkling of an
[1:24:30] eye, harpado
[1:24:32] means you made an interception.
[1:24:36] always
[1:24:37] in a game like football
[1:24:40] when the opposing team usually the other
[1:24:43] team it's a let's say a one of those
[1:24:48] nailbiting games where it's back and
[1:24:50] forth and
[1:24:53] you know it's just a good game
[1:24:56] not a blowout a good game listen we're
[1:24:59] in a good game right now
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; we got two opposing teams
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; this goal line we're about ready to
[1:25:06] cross over
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; and our prophet said, "Okay, come here.
[1:25:09] Huddle around."
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm going to tell you what to
[1:25:12] do. These are the plays we're going to
[1:25:14] do. Do your part."
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; If you're a housewife, be a good one.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; If you're a husband, be a good one. If
[1:25:24] you're a worker and all you do is dig
[1:25:26] ditches, be the best dig ditcher on the
[1:25:29] team.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not with lip service. FOR
[1:25:32] WHATSOEVER YOU DO, DO AS UNTO THE LORD.
[1:25:34] NOT AS UNTO MAN, BUT AS UNTO GOD.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:25:48] [snorts]
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; So, we can see that Satan does
[1:25:52] everything that he can to try to
[1:25:54] dissuade, discourage,
[1:25:57] and try to tear down that which God is
[1:26:00] doing.
[1:26:04] And
[1:26:06] there is something inside of me
[1:26:10] that will not give up.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not a quitter.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Never have been, never will be. Amen.
[1:26:27] [snorts]
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; So these things that I've
[1:26:31] been seeing
[1:26:33] happening within the message, we either
[1:26:36] accept it when we see the lukewarm
[1:26:41] things of life and this trying to steal
[1:26:45] your ferveny and your passion for this
[1:26:47] word. Come on.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; We either say, "Well, that's just the
[1:26:52] way it is. That's the way it will be. I
[1:26:57] am going to call those things that are
[1:26:59] not."
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; AS THOUGH THEY ARE.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; You will never steal my fire.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; You will never quench it.
[1:27:22] Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; So, let me just give you a quote here.
[1:27:25] Again, I told you I'm going to go slow.
[1:27:27] The brethren only have two pages of
[1:27:29] notes. So
[1:27:31] here in the Ephesian church age, brother
[1:27:33] Bram said, the fervent desire to please
[1:27:35] God,
[1:27:37] the passion to know his word, the cry
[1:27:40] for reaching out in the spirit all
[1:27:43] begins to fade and instead of that
[1:27:45] church being on fire with the fire of
[1:27:47] God,
[1:27:49] it has cooled off and become a bit
[1:27:51] formal.
[1:27:53] That is what's happening back there in
[1:27:55] the Ephesians. Now stop there for a
[1:27:58] moment. The Ephesians
[1:28:00] first church age
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; within 50 years false prophets, false
[1:28:05] teachers,
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; false Christs,
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; different ones. They Hey, oh, Ephesians,
[1:28:14] I have someone AGAINST YOU. YOU'VE
[1:28:15] ALREADY LOST YOUR FIRST LOVE.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Are you kidding me? These are the ones
[1:28:20] that saw Pentecost.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; These are the ones that saw the
[1:28:24] disciples, the closest that were there.
[1:28:29] And within just 50 to 70 years
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; already different ones coming up
[1:28:35] claiming this is gone, this has come to
[1:28:38] pass. The resurrection's already and
[1:28:40] everything. And Paul said, I have not
[1:28:42] ceased to warn you day and night for
[1:28:44] three years
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; that after my departing shall come
[1:28:49] grievous wolves,
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; not sparing the flock.
[1:28:55] So follow al along now as I I I read
[1:28:58] this.
[1:29:02] The abandonment to God was dying out and
[1:29:04] the people weren't too careful about
[1:29:06] what God thought of them as they began
[1:29:09] to be careful about what the world
[1:29:10] thought of them. Who cares what the
[1:29:12] world thinks about you?
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Who cares if they think you sisters look
[1:29:19] funny?
[1:29:22] They make fun of you.
[1:29:25] Who cares?
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Some Jezebel out of Hollywood,
[1:29:30] some movie star who is just an actor.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; That's all they get. Money to act, play
[1:29:37] something that they're not even
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; they're not.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That second generation
[1:29:45] coming on was just like Israel. They
[1:29:48] demanded a king to be like other
[1:29:50] nations.
[1:29:53] When they did that, they rejected God.
[1:29:55] But they did it anyway.
[1:29:58] That is the history of the church. When
[1:30:00] it thinks more of conforming to the
[1:30:02] world instead of conforming to God, it
[1:30:05] isn't long until you see them doing
[1:30:08] things they used to do and start doing
[1:30:12] things they wouldn't do initially.
[1:30:18] They changed their manner of dress,
[1:30:22] their attitudes
[1:30:24] and their behavior.
[1:30:28] They get laxed.
[1:30:31] That is what Ephesus means. Relaxed,
[1:30:35] drifting.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Let's not get laxed on this. Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; We're in the midst
[1:30:47] of the greatest moment in the history of
[1:30:52] mankind.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said
[1:30:59] that the rapture, which is the
[1:31:01] consummation,
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; is greater than when he said, "Let there
[1:31:08] be light." And there was light.
[1:31:11] It's greater
[1:31:13] than the acts of creation itself.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; So to you young men,
[1:31:25] stay focused.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Because if you miss this,
[1:31:33] you're guaranteed tribulation. That's
[1:31:35] right.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; To miss this Elijah
[1:31:41] guarantees you'll see the next one.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. [snorts]
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; The prophet could see it in the behavior
[1:31:53] of the people,
[1:31:55] their manner of dress and their
[1:31:57] attitude. I too am concerned.
[1:32:02] And this is a warning to all message
[1:32:05] believers, not only to my church, but
[1:32:09] perhaps those who archive or perhaps
[1:32:11] those who are streaming this service at
[1:32:14] this very moment.
[1:32:16] Take inventory of your lives.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Evening light fellowship,
[1:32:24] take inventory.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; HOW IS YOUR WALK WITH GOD?
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Are you becoming lax?
[1:32:33] ARE YOU BECOMING comfortable with where
[1:32:35] you're at and letting down the bars? Are
[1:32:38] you praying more?
[1:32:41] Are you reading more? Are you listening
[1:32:43] more? Are you going to church more?
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Or is it happening the opposite?
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Good question.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Ask yourself
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says, "So man, SO LET
[1:32:57] A MAN EXAMINE HIMSELF." YEAH.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; NOT A TIME to look, well, I'm better
[1:33:01] than that guy cuz he only comes once
[1:33:03] every two months. In fact, I'm very
[1:33:05] concerned because there are people in
[1:33:07] this church
[1:33:09] that we see frequent the house of God
[1:33:13] less and less. The importance on it
[1:33:15] becomes less and less.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Does that concern you?
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:28] for you to become less concerned.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; The very next thing that you will do,
[1:33:36] you will have a form of religion
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; and your children will notice it. And
[1:33:43] the first thing you sacrifice
[1:33:46] are your children.
[1:33:48] You think they're going to want to serve
[1:33:50] a God like that? You kidding me?
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; You're not even You're not even on fire
[1:33:56] about it, Dad.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; You're looking for every excuse why not
[1:33:59] to go to church.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; You stay home when you got a headache.
[1:34:06] You find every excuse in the world.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; I bought a piece of land.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; I bought some cows. I'm getting married.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Since when did getting married
[1:34:21] keep you out of the house of God?
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Well, I had some kids.
[1:34:27] You did. Wonderful.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you mothers.
[1:34:32] Here's again, this just a pastoral
[1:34:34] thought.
[1:34:36] Some of you sisters,
[1:34:39] once you have your first baby, I never
[1:34:41] see you in the congregation.
[1:34:47] Where are they?
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Well, we got to have a room in the back
[1:34:50] because they got to sit there. And the
[1:34:52] kids, they don't teach the kids.
[1:34:55] Shut up.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Sit down.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; I got to entertain them. So, the moment
[1:35:02] they peep, guess what? They're training
[1:35:04] you, Mom.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, here.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Here. Here. Take this. Here. Here. Take
[1:35:13] this here. Do something, man.
[1:35:16] [screaming]
[1:35:18] Okay. Pack them up. Go into the back
[1:35:20] room. And you never hear You've not sat
[1:35:22] through a full sermon since you had your
[1:35:25] first baby.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Man, ain't nobody amening me.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; I want you TO BE A GOOD MOTHER, BUT NOT
[1:35:38] TOO GOOD. I DON'T WANT YOU TO BABY THAT
[1:35:40] LITTLE BRAT.
[1:35:44] It used to be you mothers, you taught
[1:35:46] them kids.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; All they did is give you a look.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; I'll take you out, give you some
[1:35:54] five-fold ministry,
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; huh? Yeah.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Hey, they learn at home. You start
[1:36:02] teaching them at home.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Don't wait until you're at church.
[1:36:12] I see as a minister things creeping into
[1:36:16] the church that didn't used to be.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; And sometimes I want to say that I think
[1:36:25] if we're not careful,
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; we have church ordered oursel right out
[1:36:30] of a spontaneous move of the Holy
[1:36:32] Spirit.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; excuse me. I don't want to get out of
[1:36:35] order.
[1:36:39] that.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just let go and let God?
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Some of you have never broke the sound
[1:36:51] barrier in this church.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Like I remind you that the older sister,
[1:36:57] Brother, Brother,
[1:36:59] you preach so good today. I almost said
[1:37:04] amen.
[1:37:07] Try it some. Try it sometime.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Ron.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Because what you will do when you break
[1:37:14] that sound barrier.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; You see, when Chuck Joerger had the
[1:37:19] right stuff.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and he got into that X-15 or
[1:37:24] whatever it was and they put him and he
[1:37:26] got there and he got between Mach 1,
[1:37:29] Mach 2 or something and all of a sudden
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; there was a there was a boom, a sonic
[1:37:37] boom.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; I guess he's done. He's toast.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Next thing they HEARD [screaming]
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; UNLIMITED.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:37:48] ONCE THEY BROKE THE BARRIER,
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; he said, "BUT RIGHT AT THE BARRIER," HE
[1:37:53] SAID, "THIS THING BEGAN TO SHAKE,
[1:37:55] RATTLE, ROLL." IT'S [screaming]
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; all of a sudden
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; speedometer starts getting way up there.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; That'll happen to you.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; That'll happen to you. YOU WILL YOU WILL
[1:38:15] SAY IT'S UNLIMITED NOW. I done BROKE
[1:38:18] THROUGH THE PERIOD. UH MY MY MY VEIL
[1:38:21] WHICH HAS KEPT ME BACK. THIS THIS HUMAN
[1:38:24] VEIL WHICH IS TRYING TO HINDER ME.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; I DIED TO SELF. I I HAD DEATH TO SELF
[1:38:31] AND I SAID AMEN.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Doing you good.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; It will make you get so happy your feet
[1:38:42] will dance.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; You get excited.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; This is something to get excited about.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; As a minister, I see signs creeping in.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; I SEE SOME CHURCHES. WATCH. NOW, watch
[1:38:58] the two extremes.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; The cold formal
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; church where they just sit there and
[1:39:04] brother Ram said, "Watch if the pastor
[1:39:06] is cold formal and he's a teacher type
[1:39:09] and they sit there and they just try to
[1:39:11] absorb it." Yeah.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Then the other side," he
[1:39:15] said, "you got that fanatical element."
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "You got emotions and jumping
[1:39:19] and shouting." HE SAID, "WATCH THE
[1:39:21] PASTOR. IF HE'S THAT WAY, SO IS the
[1:39:23] church."
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; I do not want clones of me.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; I want clones of him.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to be like me. I don't
[1:39:40] even like being my like me myself.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Any of you ever get that way?
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; You do something wrong. Have you had any
[1:39:49] brains?
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Cold, formal
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; or fanatical, emotional?
[1:40:04] Now,
[1:40:06] I would rather have a little wildfire
[1:40:09] than no fire.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; And yet, I don't want our wildfire to
[1:40:13] turn into strange fire
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; to start saying things and doing things
[1:40:19] that didn't happen in the prophet's
[1:40:21] ministry.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; But there must be a balance. Yes,
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; brother said the middle of the road.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; God help us evening life fellowship to
[1:40:36] have a middle of the road gospel.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Not too fanatical and not too starchy.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Right in the middle of the road if God
[1:40:44] wants to do something here among us.
[1:40:45] Hallelujah. Huh?
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Like I tell you it
[1:40:52] Wednesday night,
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; brother Mario, you were hitting it,
[1:40:55] buddy.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; You were just hitting. I tell you what.
[1:40:59] You was hitting it left and right and
[1:41:01] everything and you said, "Now in
[1:41:02] closing, you were 15 minutes early."
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Eric said, "You're kidding me.
[1:41:11] I came here hungry."
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; I don't want some little appetizer, some
[1:41:17] little golden nugget from McDonald's.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; I want a T-bone. I know. I want
[1:41:23] something I can Hey, do you realize how
[1:41:27] much hassle I had to get to church?
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; The wife and the kids and the dog
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; and telephone calls and distractions and
[1:41:36] the car didn't start and I got a notice
[1:41:39] on my cell phone that I'm overdrawn at
[1:41:43] the bank.
[1:41:44] I'M HAVING A HARD DAY. LET HONEY, LET'S
[1:41:47] GO TO CHURCH. YEAH. WELL, the kids and
[1:41:48] you getting caught.
[1:41:54] Sometimes I think we need to reverse it.
[1:41:57] The wife is there getting all the kids
[1:41:59] ready and everything like that. Well,
[1:42:02] let her go sit in the car and you get
[1:42:03] the kids ready and then she'll sit there
[1:42:05] and honk. E My wife honked several times
[1:42:08] at me the other day. [laughter]
[1:42:13] Give me a break.
[1:42:18] I'm sorry, honey. every time I honk at
[1:42:20] you and
[1:42:23] is I didn't like it.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; I had stuff to do.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Now, just as a local pastor,
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; let's bring it down home. I want to
[1:42:35] bring it to where you're living.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Just as a pastor watches over the local
[1:42:40] sheep, you husbands watch over your
[1:42:44] families.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; You take inventory. You look,
[1:42:50] you look at your kids.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:42:56] And then mothers, watch over your
[1:42:58] children because you're the fifth
[1:42:59] gospel. You're the backbone of the
[1:43:01] church.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Mothers, I want you to mother, but not
[1:43:05] too good.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Do you understand?
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Listen, the world does not revolve
[1:43:14] around your children. It revolves around
[1:43:17] him.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:24] God bless the Love All family who all
[1:43:27] the way from Baghdad
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; would get their families, put them in
[1:43:32] the cars, drive that cut off road. I
[1:43:36] tell you what, I've been to Baghdad
[1:43:39] several times and I don't like that cut
[1:43:40] off road.
[1:43:43] I get car sick and I'm driving.
[1:43:47] But they put their kids in there.
[1:43:49] Brother Mike said, "Brother Ron, most of
[1:43:51] my kids would eat their supper on their
[1:43:54] way to church
[1:43:56] and then they started to go to sleep on
[1:43:59] their way home.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you, without sacrifice,
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; there's no blessing."
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; They could have had every excuse in the
[1:44:13] world. an hour, hour and a half, hour
[1:44:15] and 45 minutes and we got to go to
[1:44:18] church on Wednesday night.
[1:44:21] Some of you that have a hard time coming
[1:44:23] on Wednesday night, you say, "Well, I'm
[1:44:25] busy join the club."
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Which one of us are not busy?
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Which one of us on Wednesday night
[1:44:35] especially because you know what?
[1:44:37] Listen, you have to redeem the time.
[1:44:39] Amen.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about things that I see that
[1:44:42] come in here that if we're not careful,
[1:44:44] they just keep coming and and pretty
[1:44:46] soon they have more greater precedence
[1:44:49] than the word of God.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; The Bible says man examine himself
[1:44:55] first. So I ask all of us take take a
[1:44:58] good look at yourself. How are you
[1:45:00] doing? How is your walk with God? ARE
[1:45:02] YOU BECOMING MORE on fire or are you
[1:45:05] quenching the spirit
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; or are you GRIEVING THE SPIRIT WHEREBY
[1:45:11] you are sealed to the day of your
[1:45:13] redemption?
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; So I'm going to be I'm going I say this
[1:45:22] that if the husband is not in his
[1:45:25] position
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; it makes the whole family dysfunctional.
[1:45:32] True.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Now, you brethren, quit trying to get
[1:45:35] the wife in order when you're not.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Thou shalt not steal." Do
[1:45:44] you steal? [crying]
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. I I could really press it
[1:45:55] down here right now, but I just I wish
[1:45:57] to show you something that is really not
[1:46:00] spoken about a whole lot within the
[1:46:02] message, but I want to share it with
[1:46:04] you. I want you to turn with me in your
[1:46:06] Bibles to Galatians chapter 6.
[1:46:09] Galatians chapter 6
[1:46:13] vers
[1:46:14] 6-10.
[1:46:17] [snorts]
[1:46:19] Let him that is taught in the word
[1:46:23] communicate unto him that teacheth in
[1:46:26] all good things. So here you have a
[1:46:30] teacher and a student. Are we together?
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Let him that teacheth.
[1:46:36] Okay. Who taught the word communi who is
[1:46:40] being taught the word communicate unto
[1:46:42] him that teacheth
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; in all good things.
[1:46:47] Be not deceived.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; God is not mocked. So, Brother Mario did
[1:46:52] a great job on deception at the end
[1:46:54] time, but this is another great
[1:46:56] deception here. You deceive yourselves.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Be not deceived. God is not mocked. For
[1:47:07] whatsoever a man seweth, that shall he
[1:47:10] also reap. For he that sweth to the
[1:47:12] flesh shall of the flesh reap
[1:47:15] corruption,
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; but he that sweth to the spirit shall of
[1:47:20] the spirit reap life everlasting.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; So let us not be weary in welloing.
[1:47:29] For in due season we shall reap if we
[1:47:32] faint not.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:37] As we have therefore opportunity, let us
[1:47:39] do good unto all men, especially unto
[1:47:42] them who are the household of faith.
[1:47:43] Amen. Amen. So this scriptural
[1:47:46] application here is not really talked
[1:47:49] about within the message but I wish to
[1:47:51] share this with you today because it
[1:47:54] says let him communicate that
[1:47:58] that Greek word
[1:48:00] in the New Testament communicate coonia
[1:48:05] which the first Bible study I ever went
[1:48:07] to in my life when brother Mitch
[1:48:10] Buckingham asked me to go to his Bible
[1:48:13] study that he I had with some friends a
[1:48:16] Presbyterian minister. The name of that
[1:48:19] was called Coonia.
[1:48:22] I said, "Coonia, what does coonia mean?"
[1:48:24] He said, "Fellowship."
[1:48:26] Wow. Okay.
[1:48:30] Let him communicate. Coonia, it means to
[1:48:33] share with others. Communicate. It means
[1:48:36] to distribute or to be a partaker of. So
[1:48:40] it's not just
[1:48:42] sitting there observing,
[1:48:45] it's becoming a partaker.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; So let's take it a little bit farther.
[1:48:50] Let's expound on this.
[1:48:53] It's called
[1:48:55] reciprocid.
[1:48:57] Reciprocity.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Say it out loud.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Reciprocity.
[1:49:04] In other words, RECIPROCATION.
[1:49:06] WHAT GOOD IS it for a teacher to teach
[1:49:08] and you don't reciprocate? You just sit
[1:49:11] there like a cow looking at a new gate.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; YOU SIT ON THE PEW AND you do not get
[1:49:20] into it.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; You're just spectating. Oh, looks like
[1:49:26] he's all excited. He's sweating. Oh,
[1:49:28] he's getting loud.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Some of you
[1:49:36] I can't wait to see God get a hold of
[1:49:38] you and shake you like a rag doll.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; I've got a dog
[1:49:45] [snorts] that when she gets a hold of a
[1:49:47] little squeaker toy, I throw it and she
[1:49:49] gets it and she grabs a hold of that.
[1:49:56] Drives my wife nuts
[1:49:59] and I laugh and she gets a and then I
[1:50:02] got some little rag toys and I throw it
[1:50:03] and she grabs a hold of it. She shakes
[1:50:05] that thing. Her head is a blur.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; I can't wait for God to get a hold of
[1:50:11] you.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; And you who sit there
[1:50:16] who don't want to get out of order,
[1:50:20] who just
[1:50:21] I'm watching you, brother Ron.
[1:50:26] Because on the day of Pentecost, you
[1:50:28] know what they were doing?
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Sitting.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; They were just sitting.
[1:50:35] And the Bible says,
[1:50:38] "And there came a sound
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; from heaven
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; as a rushing mighty
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; wind."
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; And it began to fill
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; this whole room with his presence.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE CAME DOWN AND IT
[1:50:57] SPLIT UP.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND LITTLE LICKS OF FIRE, TONGUES
[1:51:01] OF FIRE, SAT UPON EACH ONE OF THEM.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; And you know what HAPPENED TO THEM? THEY
[1:51:05] GOT SHOOK.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; MAN, [screaming]
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; they that were afraid OF THE JEWS,
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; THEY THAT WERE AFRAID OF THE ROMANS,
[1:51:15] WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO IF THEY FIND
[1:51:17] US? THEY'RE GOING TO KILL US. CLOSE THE
[1:51:19] DOOR. BOLTED.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET NOBODY KNOW WHO WE ARE. LET ME
[1:51:24] TELL YOU, when that liquifier came on
[1:51:26] them, they became so bold,
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; they kicked that door open, they walked
[1:51:31] out. They started claiming the great
[1:51:33] mighty powerful things of God. You let
[1:51:36] God come in there and THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:51:38] GRAB A HOLD of you. It'll it'll so
[1:51:41] quicken you. It'll get you beyond, well,
[1:51:44] I'm just not that way.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:57] You're Oh, you're not.
[1:52:02] [snorts]
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Any of you ever
[1:52:04] touched something and you got shocked?
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; You ever plugged something in all of a
[1:52:09] sudden?
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; You said, "Man,
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; I remember the Yeah, it got my
[1:52:18] attention." All right. I had a friend of
[1:52:21] mine. He said, "You want to be an
[1:52:22] electrician?" "Yeah." "Yeah." Went out,
[1:52:24] bought all the tools, got me the nice
[1:52:26] nippers, the clines. You know, I spent
[1:52:28] 65 bucks for a nice pair of clines. You
[1:52:31] cut through big wires and everything
[1:52:33] like that. He said, "Okay, brother Ron,
[1:52:35] just start cutting wire." Oh, man. I
[1:52:37] know how to cut. Yeah. I mean,
[1:52:43] lights go out, sparks go everywhere.
[1:52:46] Brand new pair of clients.
[1:52:49] It ate a hole through
[1:52:53] They were not cheap either.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; You know what they called me on the job
[1:52:58] from then on?
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Sparky.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah, Sparky.
[1:53:06] Then he told me, he said, "Okay." He
[1:53:08] said, "Take this outlet that you got
[1:53:11] some outlets, you know, you got the two
[1:53:12] outlets. Take it. Take that top screw
[1:53:15] and bottom screw out and take that off
[1:53:17] and go ahead and Yeah. He didn't tell me
[1:53:20] it's still hot.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Good grief. I take it off and then I
[1:53:24] grab on both sides.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; The positive and negative met.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; When the negative of YOU
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; CATCHES THE POSITIVE OF GOD'S
[1:53:43] REVELATION, [screaming]
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; MY GOD,
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?
[1:53:49] PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; He'll make you move. All right. I
[1:53:54] promise you.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Just as electricity causes you to move.
[1:53:58] DO YOU KNOW everything around us?
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Everything around us has to do with
[1:54:04] fire.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; You go outside.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; El Saul
[1:54:11] in the sky is a fiery ball.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Without that, you'd be frozen.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:54:19] You might be chosen, but you'd be
[1:54:20] frozen.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Everything affects you by fire.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; You came here by a car, unless you got a
[1:54:29] Tesla
[1:54:31] and then you got
[1:54:33] you got electrical, but it came here by
[1:54:36] town. But the rest of you got
[1:54:38] spontaneous combustion. You got a
[1:54:40] chamber. You got gas. You put it the gas
[1:54:44] in the chamber. It ignites. You're
[1:54:46] pissing.
[1:54:49] And you came to church, you took a
[1:54:51] shower, took a bath, you washed your
[1:54:53] face. Guess what? Hot water. I hate cold
[1:54:56] water to shower in.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; We were in South Africa
[1:55:03] over there and had a nice little Airbnb
[1:55:06] and everything. And we had traveled all
[1:55:08] day to get there. And man, I'm tired.
[1:55:11] I'm hot and sweaty, greasy. I want to
[1:55:13] take a shower. And I go in there and you
[1:55:15] turn on the knob and you think, well,
[1:55:17] it's not all the way or which way is
[1:55:19] hot, cold. A lot of times they don't
[1:55:21] tell you. Anyway, I sit there, wait for
[1:55:24] 20 minutes. No. Okay. Turn it the other
[1:55:26] way. Time. You got to be kidding me. So,
[1:55:29] I take a cold shower.
[1:55:33] Don't take me long to shower when it's
[1:55:35] cold.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; I get out of there. My goodness, that's
[1:55:40] cold.
[1:55:42] I did that for two days because the
[1:55:46] people who at the reception this was and
[1:55:48] guess what? Nobody's there on Sunday.
[1:55:51] So, man, I don't have anybody to tell.
[1:55:53] So, anyway, finally after two days, I've
[1:55:55] had it.
[1:55:57] I want a hot.
[1:56:00] [snorts] I finally get to the reception.
[1:56:02] Hey, how much you guys
[1:56:05] studio whatever number 22? We ain't got
[1:56:09] no hot water. Well, we'll try to find
[1:56:11] No, you're not going to try to find Send
[1:56:13] somebody right now. I want to take a hot
[1:56:15] shower. I go over there. You know what?
[1:56:17] They You know what? It was just the
[1:56:19] breaker.
[1:56:21] Well, I don't know which breaker it is.
[1:56:23] I'm not going to go here tripping
[1:56:25] breakers.
[1:56:28] [snorts] It has been my lot in life for
[1:56:31] some reason that when I go to take a
[1:56:34] shower, something goes wrong.
[1:56:41] I don't I'm I'm just telling you we
[1:56:44] stayed at the Frankfurt Sherin. Wow.
[1:56:47] Five star. This is Brother Floyd
[1:56:49] Patterson. He got brother Ron. We're
[1:56:51] staying at the Frankfurt Sherin right
[1:56:53] there at the airport. Yeah, man. I never
[1:56:55] I'm using at Holiday Inner, you know.
[1:56:59] [laughter]
[1:57:02] So, we I get in there. Oh, man. Yeah. I
[1:57:05] kind of like this. Oo, nice bed.
[1:57:09] Go in there, start get in the shower,
[1:57:12] brother Joel. I get my I had hair then.
[1:57:16] Get my hair, get it all soaked up and
[1:57:19] everything like that. They go those
[1:57:20] squirt bottles on the wall
[1:57:23] like this. I
[1:57:25] dribble dribble dribble
[1:57:30] dribble dribble dribble.
[1:57:33] Okay, wait a second. Just just wait.
[1:57:37] I wait 10 15 minutes.
[1:57:41] Nothing.
[1:57:44] Okay. What do you do? You got soap all
[1:57:46] over you.
[1:57:48] Okay. All right. Well, I go to the tank
[1:57:50] above the toilet. I take off the lid. I
[1:57:53] put water.
[1:57:56] I didn't out of the toilet bowl. Out of
[1:57:59] the canister ABOVE IT. GUYS, DON'T
[1:58:01] LAUGH. [screaming]
[1:58:03] I CAUGHT THAT SON. That guy's pretty
[1:58:06] stupid, you know.
[1:58:09] So, I got the tank. I finally Okay. So,
[1:58:11] I got enough of the soap off me. I
[1:58:13] called the front desk and I said, "Hey,
[1:58:15] hey, you guys." They said, "Well, what
[1:58:17] room are you? I'm in this and this."
[1:58:18] Said, "Okay, well, you know, look." And
[1:58:21] I said, "We're leaving a little bit. We
[1:58:22] We got to go to a meeting, but I'll be
[1:58:24] back and okay, we'll fix it." Okay,
[1:58:26] great. Great. Great. No problem. So, I
[1:58:28] came back later that day and and I
[1:58:30] called the front desk. Did you guys fix
[1:58:31] it? Yeah, we sent a technician there and
[1:58:34] it's no problem and everything. And so
[1:58:36] the next day I go to take a shower again
[1:58:38] and I run it and I run the water and
[1:58:41] everything like that and I I'm 10
[1:58:43] minutes in the shower just uh Okay.
[1:58:46] Okay. Yeah. Okay. Finally lather up,
[1:58:49] man.
[1:58:54] Two time two days in a row
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; again.
[1:59:03] They said, "Well, Mr. Peterson, we're
[1:59:05] going to comp you. We're going to give
[1:59:07] you free room for those two days." Well,
[1:59:10] thank you. Thank you. But I would have
[1:59:12] rather had a hot hot shower. Do you
[1:59:14] understand? Anyway, I don't know why I
[1:59:16] told you guys that. It just So,
[1:59:20] anyway, it happens everywhere I go.
[1:59:26] Happened just the other day, three, four
[1:59:28] days ago. I'm at down in Tucson, nice
[1:59:31] motel, and it doesn't say hot or cold.
[1:59:36] It doesn't have any indication. So, I
[1:59:38] think turn it all the way and it's going
[1:59:41] to get hot. It doesn't. This was
[1:59:44] opposite. Jonathan, you just had to turn
[1:59:47] it just a little bit and then
[1:59:52] go figure, man.
[1:59:54] That that anyway, I don't know why I'm
[1:59:56] telling you this. Just there are certain
[1:59:59] things that frustrate me that's a anyway
[2:00:02] now
[2:00:04] reciprocity
[2:00:07] whatever it is reciprocation let's use
[2:00:09] that I can say that reciprocation there
[2:00:12] must be a reciprocation in other words
[2:00:14] you must communicate back to him that
[2:00:16] teaches
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; do you understand that
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Christ poured out his life and he
[2:00:22] expects a return on his investment
[2:00:28] Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; GOD IS AN AWARD OF GOD.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; He gave talents
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; to some 10 to another five, a couple
[2:00:39] two. And when he came back, he expected.
[2:00:42] What did you bring back?
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; And the one who said, "Oh, I know he's a
[2:00:48] he's an aura of God, and he really
[2:00:50] demands, SO I HID IT, and I didn't lose
[2:00:53] it. OH, I I CAME BACK AND I still have
[2:00:55] the one talent you gave me.
[2:00:58] And just the opposite of what you
[2:01:00] thought, go, "Oh, good and faithful
[2:01:03] servant. You're so good. You kept the
[2:01:05] one talent. You're so good." No, he
[2:01:07] said, "Take what he's got and give it to
[2:01:08] the guy that's got 10."
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; God expects
[2:01:14] reciprocation
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; from what he has done for you. that you
[2:01:19] might do something for the church. That
[2:01:21] you might do SOMETHING FOR HIM. QUIT
[2:01:23] asking
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; like John F. Kennedy. It's not what you
[2:01:26] ask what your country can do for you.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Ask what you can do for your country.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Quit asking what is this church going to
[2:01:36] do for you. What are you going to do for
[2:01:37] this church?
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Let there be a reciprocation.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Let there be you to to
[2:01:45] coonia. WE HAVE FELLOWSHIP ONE WITH
[2:01:47] ANOTHER. HOW DARE THAT GOD GIVE
[2:01:50] EVERYTHING AND then he gets nothing in
[2:01:52] return. HE GAVE TO HIS UTTERMOST
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; PARTY. AMEN.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; And then WE CAN COME TO CHURCH AND WE
[2:02:00] DON'T RECIPROCATE. WE SIT THERE AND we
[2:02:02] don't enter in in worship. Come on.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[2:02:13] That troubles me when I see people
[2:02:16] that don't reciprocate.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "He that is forgiven
[2:02:26] much,
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; I guess that's why I love him the way I
[2:02:31] do."
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but
[2:02:35] I love him with a
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; with a passion.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; I gave him my old teddy garment.
[2:02:52] He gave me a robe of pure white.
[2:02:58] I'm feasting
[2:03:01] on heavenly manner.
[2:03:04] And that's why I'm singing tonight.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:15] [snorts]
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; You got to communicate back. Isaiah
[2:03:18] 55:11 SAYS, "SHOW, SO SHALL MY word that
[2:03:22] goeth forth out of my mouth.
[2:03:25] It shall NOT RETURN UNTO ME VOID,
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; BUT IT SHALL ACCOMPLISH THAT WHICH I
[2:03:31] PLEASE,
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; and it shall prosper in the thing,
[2:03:35] whether I sent it, whereto I sent it,
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; MY WORD DOES NOT come back empty or
[2:03:41] worthless."
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; God expects a return. AMEN.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; GOD EXPECTS PRAISE ON YOUR LIP.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; GOD EXPECTS YOU TO RECIPROCATE. THANK
[2:03:52] YOU FOR YOUR LOVE.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you for WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR CALVARY. AMEN.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Every one of you.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Don't let it be that brother Robert has
[2:04:13] to
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; say, "Come on, raise your hand."
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; How about you becoming the song leader
[2:04:20] and brother Robert, let them go sit out
[2:04:22] there
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; or you go sit out there.
[2:04:26] Do you know how hard you pull
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; now?
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Robert, I I say this and I love
[2:04:40] you as my brother.
[2:04:42] I'm so happy to have you as a song
[2:04:45] leader and as as one of the
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; my lead song leader.
[2:04:54] You don't have the most beautiful voice.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; And so do I.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; But
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; you got the most beautiful spirit.
[2:05:09] [applause]
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for talent.
[2:05:20] I don't care if you can't really carry
[2:05:22] the tune.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; I love to see brother Robert and you
[2:05:26] know what he does? He gets into it. And
[2:05:28] I said, "Brother Robert," I said, "When
[2:05:30] you get into it," I said, "Don't leave
[2:05:32] them out there OBSERVING YOU. BRING THEM
[2:05:34] WITH YOU."
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; And so NOW HE GETS OUT HERE. HE GETS
[2:05:38] BESIDES HERE. I LOVE HIM. DON'T YOU? AND
[2:05:41] ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU GET IN AND YOU ARE
[2:05:43] BROUGHT WITH HIM. HOW DARE YOU sit there
[2:05:46] and not reciprocate?
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Christ poured out his life.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; He expects something in return and
[2:06:02] multiply.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Press down.
[2:06:08] Amen.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; David poured out his life
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; and killed one giant.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; He poured out his life before men and
[2:06:19] they killed many of Goliath's brothers.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; He put an investment.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; They reciprocated.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; The teacher is now being kept
[2:06:34] by those who were taught.
[2:06:37] Which one of you plants a garden and
[2:06:39] don't eat of it?
[2:06:41] Which one of you has a milk cow and
[2:06:44] doesn't drink the milk?
[2:06:46] Which one of you go to work for a nice
[2:06:48] boss
[2:06:50] and don't expect a nice paycheck?
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; I tell you, you wouldn't be there very
[2:06:56] long. I don't care how much you like
[2:06:58] your job.
[2:06:59] If you didn't get that nice paycheck,
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; it is not fair for God
[2:07:09] to pour all he had
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; without expecting something.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; But I'm afraid
[2:07:21] we have become of welfare mentality. Let
[2:07:23] me explain that. We have so many free
[2:07:26] giveaway programs, we become a socialist
[2:07:29] government,
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Marxist.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; We have kids that play soccer. It
[2:07:35] doesn't matter if there's a a winning
[2:07:37] team and a losing team and every But all
[2:07:40] the teams get trophies now just because
[2:07:43] you played
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; because
[2:07:51] I don't want to be second. Well, tough.
[2:07:54] Sorry. Huh?
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Play better.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Huh? Get into the game.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; That's what's happening right now in
[2:08:07] America.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; We have so many that want to stay home
[2:08:10] and work from home. They don't want to
[2:08:13] go back to work again.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; We have hundreds of thousands of offices
[2:08:18] that are empty
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; because they don't want to go to work.
[2:08:23] You know what I have to do?
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; I have to get dressed.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; I have to comb my hair. I have to get
[2:08:30] there on time.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; But we're
[2:08:37] becoming a socialist society. Without
[2:08:39] sacrifice, there's no blessing.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; People tend to think that the prophet of
[2:08:44] God never got down or discouraged.
[2:08:49] He didn't see all this reciprocation to
[2:08:52] his own ministry. In fact, he finally
[2:08:55] one day he said, "I've lost the feeling
[2:08:57] for the people because what good has all
[2:08:59] this done?
[2:09:02] All of the labor, all of the ministry,
[2:09:04] all of the times,
[2:09:07] all of this of
[2:09:10] going and traveling and preaching,
[2:09:13] he didn't see evening life fellowship
[2:09:16] and end time ministry. He didn't see all
[2:09:19] kinds of people coming.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; I think I'll just go up into Canada,
[2:09:28] become a trapper, forget this stuff.
[2:09:31] It wasn't that he didn't that he quit
[2:09:33] loving God. He lost the feeling for the
[2:09:35] people.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Because there was no reciprocation.
[2:09:42] You remember the time that brother
[2:09:43] Brennham he he got to bragging about he
[2:09:45] could swim? Oh man. Daddy. He told his
[2:09:49] uncle and his daddy, I'm a swimmer. Oh,
[2:09:51] you are? Watch this. Look at this quote.
[2:09:54] Here it is. 12:05.
[2:09:59] [snorts]
[2:10:00] redemption in completeness in joy. I
[2:10:03] used to tell my uncle and my daddy, "Oh,
[2:10:05] I can Oh, I can see swim
[2:10:11] in this little pond up here in Utica
[2:10:14] Pike." One day, daddy went back and sat
[2:10:17] on a culvert and said, "I want to see
[2:10:19] you swim."
[2:10:21] Little pond was about that deep, but I
[2:10:23] was just standing on a soap box. I
[2:10:24] stripped off my belongings and got on my
[2:10:27] uh nose like this and sprang up and
[2:10:30] splashed down the soap box hit and the
[2:10:32] mud flew both ways and I began to splash
[2:10:35] the mud. I said, "HOW AM I DOING, DAD?
[2:10:38] Get out there
[2:10:41] swimming, mud crawling all the time." We
[2:10:44] got a lot of mud crawling church
[2:10:45] members, too.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. Mud crawlers. Yes, sir.
[2:10:51] I call them what do you what do you call
[2:10:53] what's this when
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; dog pal
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; dogg pal how many you look at me swim
[2:10:58] I'm swimming man
[2:11:01] you ain't swimming you're dog crawling
[2:11:06] brother Jonathan when you and I were
[2:11:10] he and I in the boat together I said
[2:11:12] come on he said I don't really swim well
[2:11:14] I put on a vest and everything little
[2:11:15] mask and snorkel come on jump out of the
[2:11:17] boat he did
[2:11:19] bless you Brother Jonathan, but it made
[2:11:22] you nervous, didn't it?
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Cuz you ain't a swimmer.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; But I said, it's it's deep. It was only
[2:11:28] 12 feet, but 12 ft,
[2:11:31] you ain't 13t tall.
[2:11:34] Your feet couldn't touch the bottom
[2:11:40] if you don't know how to swim. So he
[2:11:42] dogped, but he was sitting there and
[2:11:43] brother Ram said he called it mud
[2:11:45] crawling. Look at this. [snorts]
[2:11:49] We got a lot of mud crawlers out there.
[2:11:50] Oh my. My my uncle
[2:11:53] Jesse got a hold of me one day on the
[2:11:55] boat.
[2:12:01] We got some guys that they ain't going
[2:12:03] to baby their boys. Yeah. You tell me
[2:12:05] you can swim. Watch what one day my
[2:12:07] uncle got me out on the boat and I was
[2:12:09] popping off about swimming out there
[2:12:11] over the Ohio River about 20 foot of
[2:12:13] water. He just took over the or knocked
[2:12:15] me off in the water and said, "Now what
[2:12:18] about it?" Amen. Hallelujah. [laughter]
[2:12:22] Ah, God give us more uncles and say,
[2:12:25] "Oh, you want to swim here?"
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; The fact of the matter is,
[2:12:35] what good is it for the ministry to give
[2:12:38] and give and give and not reciprocate?
[2:12:40] Amen.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking just about the men.
[2:12:43] We're talking about Christ and his
[2:12:45] church.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; The little Shounomite recognized
[2:12:51] that Elijah needed a place to rest and
[2:12:55] relax himself. So she said, "I want to
[2:12:58] build a little house." Do you know that
[2:13:00] brother Brandham told brother Charlie
[2:13:04] Cox and sister Nelly as the Shunomite
[2:13:07] woman of the Old Testament, you have
[2:13:09] become
[2:13:11] a place that I can come rest. Now, I was
[2:13:14] at Billy or excuse me, at at brother
[2:13:17] Charlie Cox's house
[2:13:20] and I was there and he was telling me
[2:13:22] and I happened to go with brother Floyd
[2:13:24] Patterson and we were invited back there
[2:13:26] and we went to all the different places
[2:13:29] and he I said, "What was it like,
[2:13:32] brother Charlie?" He said, "Brother
[2:13:33] Brandon would come here by himself. He'd
[2:13:36] drive up and he said he'd get out of the
[2:13:38] car." He said, "Brother Ron, honestly,
[2:13:40] it looked like he'd been in a fight.
[2:13:43] He was so worn and so tired. He'd been
[2:13:46] preaching conventions and he got up
[2:13:48] there and he said he just looked beaten.
[2:13:52] He said, we didn't say nothing to him.
[2:13:54] We just said, "Brother, brother Bill, go
[2:13:56] on in there. Uh, here's your room.
[2:13:59] [snorts] Why don't you go in and relax
[2:14:00] or sit on the front porch on a rocking
[2:14:03] chair? When Nelly's got dinner ready,
[2:14:06] we'll we'll call you." And so he did.
[2:14:09] And he didn't say much when he came to
[2:14:11] the dinner table. He didn't say much.
[2:14:14] Wasn't a time for them to have questions
[2:14:16] and answers,
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Wasn't a time to just say, "Hey, hey,
[2:14:20] Brother Bill, I was thinking the other
[2:14:22] day when I was reading the scripture and
[2:14:23] I read this over here and everything."
[2:14:25] No, you know what? They they said, "We
[2:14:27] just let him rest, relax."
[2:14:30] And he said after two or three days and
[2:14:33] in fact he said brother Brennham when I
[2:14:36] would put the prophet to bed he said I'd
[2:14:38] go in there and I would tuck him in. He
[2:14:40] said I'd bring the he get in and he said
[2:14:44] I bring the covers up and I'd take his
[2:14:46] arms and cross them over like this or
[2:14:50] this. And brother said thank you.
[2:14:53] and he laid there and he was so tired
[2:14:57] that brother Charlie would open the door
[2:14:58] to peek in to see how he's doing and
[2:15:01] brother Brennham hadn't moved all night.
[2:15:04] He was so tired.
[2:15:09] Do you know that brother Brennham said
[2:15:13] that hunting is an excuse for me to get
[2:15:15] away from the people?
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; I got a quote. I'm going to show you
[2:15:22] that.
[2:15:29] Charlie Cox
[2:15:32] would take brother Brennham because
[2:15:34] brother Brennon one of his favorite
[2:15:35] things was just to go hunting.
[2:15:41] So they
[2:15:43] but after about two or three days,
[2:15:46] brother Brennham got to talking at the
[2:15:47] dinner table. He said to Charlie,
[2:15:50] Charlie, have you found where all the
[2:15:52] Yeah, brother Brennham, I know. Well,
[2:15:54] let's go
[2:15:58] now. Brother Brenham says in this, "As I
[2:16:01] was with Moses, so I will be with thee."
[2:16:03] 1960.
[2:16:05] I want to say to this to the church now,
[2:16:07] I got to tell you some things that's
[2:16:09] been going on. A lot of times you think
[2:16:12] I'm hunting. I'm not hunting.
[2:16:16] That's an excuse to keep people from
[2:16:18] following me.
[2:16:22] I have to go there to be alone with God.
[2:16:26] I'm not going out hunting, friends. Yes,
[2:16:29] I'm hunting, but not that kind of hunt.
[2:16:33] Isn't this amazing?
[2:16:35] I want to ask you, what was he doing
[2:16:38] when there was a blast that came to him
[2:16:42] and seven angels appeared?
[2:16:45] He was hunting.
[2:16:50] He was hunting.
[2:16:55] He was getting a away alone. And brother
[2:16:59] Roy Borders told me this. Musicians have
[2:17:01] become I'm going to close. I I I've laid
[2:17:04] a foundation for something for the next
[2:17:07] time that I minister.
[2:17:10] Brother Roy Borders, his manager,
[2:17:13] who I happen to
[2:17:15] to take hunting for several days and he
[2:17:18] had cancer real bad and wasn't feeling
[2:17:20] good.
[2:17:26] So I'd put him on a horse and take him
[2:17:28] to the to the blind where he was he
[2:17:30] would sit and I'd make sure he had his
[2:17:32] food and everything and I'd come back
[2:17:34] and I say check on him during and then
[2:17:36] come pick him up late in the evening.
[2:17:39] And one morning he said, "Brother Ron, I
[2:17:41] I don't feel good. Do you mind if we
[2:17:43] just stay in the cabin?" I said, "No, if
[2:17:44] you'll tell me some stories."
[2:17:51] These men, he said, "You know, Brother
[2:17:53] Ron," he says, "Uh, I was in charge of
[2:17:57] getting the men to come and go hunting
[2:17:58] with Brother Brenamman." And he said,
[2:17:59] "Brother Brennham, I would run by the
[2:18:01] names of the brother." Yes, that's fine.
[2:18:03] That brother. Yes. Yes. Yes. Good. He
[2:18:06] said, "But Brother Roy, please tell the
[2:18:08] brethren to not ask me any spiritual
[2:18:11] questions. I'm out there to rest.
[2:18:14] So, Brother Roy would
[2:18:17] tell all the brethren, "Now, Brother
[2:18:19] Bram's going to be here, and I don't
[2:18:22] want you to ask him questions."
[2:18:26] He said, "Now, as it is, every time we
[2:18:29] go, guess what? God always provides a
[2:18:32] way." And Brother Brennham drops into a
[2:18:33] channel at some time, begins to tell the
[2:18:36] brethren spiritually what's going on.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; But one brother His
[2:18:44] claim to fame was, he said, "Brother
[2:18:45] Brandham, do you ever see a vision while
[2:18:48] you're out here?" This is on tape.
[2:18:51] He said, "Immediately, I dropped into a
[2:18:53] vision. I see your mother. Your mother's
[2:18:56] got appendages between her toes. You got
[2:19:00] something wrong with your eye." And and
[2:19:02] anyway, that was his great claim to
[2:19:05] fame. Here's the rest of the story that
[2:19:07] the rest of you will never know.
[2:19:11] He said, "Underst understand that when
[2:19:13] he broke that cardinal rule, he was
[2:19:15] never asked to go hunting with brother
[2:19:17] Brandham again." Because the very thing
[2:19:20] I said, "Don't don't ask him." Do you
[2:19:23] see what I'm saying? And yet, there were
[2:19:25] so many people that wanted to go hunting
[2:19:27] with brother Brandham, that wanted to be
[2:19:30] there,
[2:19:32] but all of them said, or were told,
[2:19:34] "Please, he's out here to just relax.
[2:19:39] when he sits around the campfire and he
[2:19:41] starts sharing the things that's
[2:19:44] different.
[2:19:46] But don't go to pulling on his gift.
[2:19:54] Now, my sermon
[2:19:57] as I titled it, I don't even know if I
[2:20:00] told the brothers the title. Refueling
[2:20:02] the fire within you.
[2:20:04] Refueling the fire within you.
[2:20:08] And the subject it's lamp trimming time.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; Now you all that have got an oil lamp
[2:20:14] and you put the fire and you know if you
[2:20:18] let that fire burn, burn, burn,
[2:20:20] eventually the oil goes down. Now
[2:20:23] brother Brennham said there is one
[2:20:26] baptism of the Holy Spirit but many
[2:20:28] refillings.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:20:33] I want to ask you,
[2:20:37] how's the gauge
[2:20:39] on your lamp right now?
[2:20:43] Is it reading full or empty?
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, because we've been burning, burning,
[2:20:50] burning.
[2:20:55] You know what some of us need?
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; I put myself in there, too.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; We need another refilling.
[2:21:04] We need a refueling of the Holy Spirit.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; Did you know that Elijah did not get a
[2:21:12] double portion until he ministered back
[2:21:14] to Elijah? How many you know that
[2:21:17] brother Brennham says and the Bible says
[2:21:19] Elijah did not get it until he watered
[2:21:22] or poured water over the hands of
[2:21:24] Elijah.
[2:21:26] He reciprocated back.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; You know, one of the ways that we can
[2:21:37] give a scripture application of giving
[2:21:39] back to God is your tithing.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; But it's not your money that God is
[2:21:51] actually wanting. He He's wanting you.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just ask you a question.
[2:21:59] How about the tithing of your time?
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; I began to figure it out. We got a 24
[2:22:11] hours in a day, seven days a week.
[2:22:13] That's 168 hours. out of 168 hours
[2:22:18] in the week,
[2:22:20] you have 50 hours that I'm just roughly
[2:22:24] 50 hours that you go to work because you
[2:22:26] drive to work and you got 40 hour work
[2:22:28] week etc etc and you go to lunch you got
[2:22:32] a 50 hour work week
[2:22:35] minus that from 168
[2:22:39] gives 118
[2:22:42] and most of you sleep eight hours a day
[2:22:44] and if you don't get your eight hours
[2:22:45] and you have to catch up on that. And
[2:22:48] some of you don't need a full 8 hours,
[2:22:49] but let's just say 8 hours of sleep.
[2:22:54] Then you got
[2:22:56] 60. So that leaves 62. Then you got
[2:22:59] eating,
[2:23:01] getting dressed, hobbies, going to the
[2:23:03] gym, your iPad.
[2:23:09] So now you're down to
[2:23:12] less than 50 hours of the rest of the
[2:23:14] week of what you what you do with it.
[2:23:17] That that's yours. It's personal. But
[2:23:19] God says, "Would you give me one/10enth
[2:23:21] of what's onetenth of 50?"
[2:23:27] Can you give him five hours?
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; And when we come to church, it's not
[2:23:32] just coming. It's not attendance.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; It's getting into it. Amen.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Well, I went to church. That's okay. But
[2:23:40] did you get into it?
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Last quote here. Christ is revealed
[2:23:51] the same. Usually a revival lasts about
[2:23:54] three years,
[2:23:58] but this has gone on for many years.
[2:24:01] Now the revival fires are quietening
[2:24:03] down.
[2:24:05] Enthusiasm of the people is dying off
[2:24:08] and you can see it in the old [snorts]
[2:24:11] temple of Vesta in Rome. When the fires
[2:24:13] went out, the people went home.
[2:24:16] But we're trying to rebuild these fires
[2:24:17] again on every hill that we can.
[2:24:20] I cannot do it. No minister can. It
[2:24:23] takes all of us together in prayer and
[2:24:25] believing and trusting God to see the
[2:24:28] Holy Spirit continue to bless his
[2:24:30] people. as we wait on his coming.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; This is a concerted effort.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; It's not just the pastor.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; It's not just the ministry.
[2:24:48] It's us together.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; You understand this?
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; Reciprocate.
[2:24:58] When we have song service, get into it.
[2:25:03] What's wrong with it? Clap it.
[2:25:07] Listen.
[2:25:10] I used to go to sporting games and you
[2:25:14] know what? If I ever went to a Dbacks
[2:25:16] game [music] and there's people around,
[2:25:19] they're all talking or what I'm watching
[2:25:21] the game. Sorry. Watching the game.
[2:25:23] That's why I paid the money. I'm
[2:25:24] watching the game. Even if I got a hot
[2:25:26] dog.
[2:25:30] I'm watching the game.
[2:25:32] I get into the game when it's it's
[2:25:35] crazy, brother Robert, when I go to
[2:25:37] watch these guys play baseball,
[2:25:40] softball,
[2:25:42] okay,
[2:25:45] I root for every one of them.
[2:25:53] Come on, Austin.
[2:25:55] Hit that ball. SMACK THAT THING. PLAY
[2:25:59] BALL, BOYS.
[2:26:01] Get into the game.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; I do. I Brother Paul and I, we used to
[2:26:07] sit there and you know what? And it's
[2:26:09] dangerous to sit in your pole.
[2:26:12] Yeah. Did you see that? Did you SEE THAT
[2:26:15] CAT CATCH he made? Yeah, I did. YEAH.
[2:26:18] YEAH. GOOD. GOOD. THAT'S MY GRANDSON.
[2:26:24] YEAH.
[2:26:25] I have been that way my whole life.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; When I go to watch these guys play ball,
[2:26:30] most of the time I'm watching them play
[2:26:32] ball.
[2:26:36] And you know, brother Paul, what what
[2:26:38] I've said and you know what I I stick up
[2:26:41] for my team, too. One time there was a
[2:26:44] guy on first base and he got to yelling
[2:26:46] at something. There was a play somewhere
[2:26:47] and and I think a play at Homer and he
[2:26:50] was yelling that the umpire called him
[2:26:52] out or something like this and he was
[2:26:54] yelling at our guys. I jumped up into
[2:26:57] the fence,
[2:27:00] HEY YOU FIRST BASEMAN, SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
[2:27:05] [laughter]
[2:27:07] All of my team looking over at me.
[2:27:12] Yeah, you I'm Oh, excuse me, guys.
[2:27:16] Yeah, sorry.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; You know what I do? I stick up for my
[2:27:21] team and I stick up for this team.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; We are the 18.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; And when we play, I want you to play
[2:27:32] with all you got.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; Go hard or go home.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; Go hard or you go home.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; Get into this game. Amen.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; When we come to church,
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; I want you to enter in.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to observe.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; I'd like to take all of you young boys,
[2:28:04] one of these days. I want to do it. Take
[2:28:06] you guys all to a maybe a Dback's game
[2:28:09] or something like that. I'm not into all
[2:28:11] of those sports and you guys know that.
[2:28:15] But I'd like to take you to the game and
[2:28:17] I don't want to see how you act when
[2:28:19] you're there if you sit like you do in
[2:28:22] church.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; I don't think so.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't think so.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And the wind up in the pitch.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; YEAH. SMACK THERE. GO AND ALL THE WAY TO
[2:28:36] THE WALL. YOU CAN TOUCH THEM ALL AND YOU
[2:28:38] GOT YEAH.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY TEAM.
[2:28:42] WELL, how about once in a while?
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; That you get a little beside yourself.
[2:28:53] No, [snorts] I'm not asking
[2:28:55] for something that ain't real. Because
[2:28:57] if you don't mean it, don't do it.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Genuine. Genuine.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; So,
[2:29:09] I'm going to talk about refueling the
[2:29:11] fire.
[2:29:13] I had another nine pages of notes that I
[2:29:17] thought, you know what,
[2:29:19] I don't want to go into that because
[2:29:21] it'll make this service too long. as it
[2:29:24] is. I only had
[2:29:26] two pages of quotes to give you guys
[2:29:29] [music] and normally you got nine or 10,
[2:29:30] but you know, hey, it it's it's enough
[2:29:34] because there is something
[2:29:36] inside of me
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; that is telling me I do not accept
[2:29:43] lukewarmness.
[2:29:53] I want to I don't want a burnout.
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; I want a breakthrough.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; Flame on.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; I want to be so on fire for God.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; The older I get, I don't want to just
[2:30:14] Well,
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; praise God.
[2:30:18] Huh?
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; I'm more on fire for him now than I was
[2:30:23] when I was 18.
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; I have got a greater passion now.
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; And yet my body.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; Huh? As much as I want it to jump, I
[2:30:32] tell it to jump. It don't.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm talking about?
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; Anyway, I love you guys. All of you.
[2:30:47] But we can do better.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; Be not deceived.
[2:30:56] God is not mocked.
[2:30:58] You that have been so into the flesh and
[2:31:00] you wonder why you're not getting into
[2:31:02] the spirit like you should.
[2:31:08] Don't mock God.
[2:31:11] If we took the amount of time
[2:31:15] of when you log in in your prayer and
[2:31:18] you log out,
[2:31:20] the time you read your Bible, log in and
[2:31:23] log out. The time that you listen to a
[2:31:26] tape, log in and log out. How much time
[2:31:29] do you have
[2:31:31] in 24 hours that you've given to God?
[2:31:35] Some of you, sorry, you you haven't been
[2:31:38] showing up for work.
[2:31:41] You ain't even logged in.
[2:31:44] I want all of you to take
[2:31:48] inventory of yourself and say, "I can do
[2:31:50] better."
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, if you're the coach or
[2:31:54] you're the captain of the team,
[2:32:00] I'll take correction.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; Will you receive the correction?
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; Huh? Amen.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; If you not been doing what you should be
[2:32:09] doing, will you be honest with yourself
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; and say, "I'll try to do better."
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I I just been caught up and my
[2:32:20] work
[2:32:22] and the kids
[2:32:27] and life in general has just kind of got
[2:32:29] me bogged down, but I would like to do
[2:32:32] better.
[2:32:33] How many would agree with me and say,
[2:32:35] "I'd like to do better."
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; Paul, come up here and stand with me.
[2:32:46] Steve, come up here and stand with me.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:32:55] I only had three stand up, so I wanted
[2:32:56] them to come here. You got my back. Get
[2:32:58] up here, Paul.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brian, get up your men.
[2:33:09] Do you guys see him kind of all crippled
[2:33:11] up?
[2:33:14] Do you know he's a battle scard veteran?
[2:33:20] How many years you spent in the
[2:33:22] hospital?
[2:33:25] Since Since uh 2005,
[2:33:28] right up till now.
[2:33:31] 2005 till now because you got all shot
[2:33:34] up and wounded.
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, I see you lay down
[2:33:39] here.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; You know what it's like to be in battle?
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, I do.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; Brian, you come on Monday mornings.
[2:33:57] Sometimes you come a little bit late.
[2:33:59] That's okay. And I say and you come up.
[2:34:03] You say, "Brother, brother, I want you
[2:34:05] to know my wife and I were talking. You
[2:34:07] I love what you said. Is it many times
[2:34:10] you say that?"
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; You say, "My wife and I, we was talking
[2:34:13] about this and this very same thing."
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; brother Paul. I have noticed that many
[2:34:19] times I start talking and everything. I
[2:34:21] say, "I don't even tell anybody." Next
[2:34:24] thing you know, Yes.
[2:34:29] with men like this behind me. Just stand
[2:34:32] right here. Stand. Come. Come right
[2:34:34] here.
[2:34:35] Come on. Just stand right behind me.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; I got great men.
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; I got great men.
[2:34:50] I'm not worthy.
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; Is it him?
[2:34:57] It's him in us.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; Why do you get so fanatical, Paul?
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; I love him so much.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; You do?
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, I do.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; Well, so do I.
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason that I get
[2:35:11] EMOTIONAL WHEN YOU GET emotional cuz I
[2:35:14] can't help it.
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; I'm an emotional kind of guy.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; Because he that's forgiven much.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; You know what it's like to go into
[2:35:28] battle?
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; Life and death.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've gone into the forest with my
[2:35:38] rifle in my hand. I ain't never had
[2:35:41] anybody shooting back at me. I've been
[2:35:43] hunting deer for help.
[2:35:46] Do you guys know what he's been through
[2:35:52] when he comes and he lays here at this
[2:35:55] altar before service? I don't know if
[2:35:57] any of you have seen him. He can't get
[2:35:59] his legs straight, so he lays with his
[2:36:02] leg out. He tries to get up.
[2:36:07] When I have men like that
[2:36:10] that will lay on their face before God,
[2:36:17] Thank you
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; brother.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you brotherless.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your servitude.
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you pressing the battle.
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:40] [snorts]
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:45] I'd like to bring all of you up here.
[2:36:48] I would and say, "Okay, let's all make a
[2:36:52] recommitment, but we can't do it." Do
[2:36:54] you know how proud I am of you? Like you
[2:36:56] four girls that came up here and sang.
[2:37:06] And all of you, I watched you as you
[2:37:08] left. I watched you. I I looked at your
[2:37:10] skirts.
[2:37:12] I looked at as you left. I thought God
[2:37:16] bless him.
[2:37:18] [laughter]
[2:37:25] &gt;&gt; I said, "Why?"
[2:37:28] Look at them.
[2:37:30] In an age of laa, you have the boldness
[2:37:35] &gt;&gt; to live for God, to keep your face
[2:37:38] washed,
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; TO NOT DO WHAT THE REST OF THEM DO. FOR
[2:37:42] easy is it to go the way of the many,
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; BUT BROAD IS the great,
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; is the gate
[2:37:51] that leads to destruction, and many
[2:37:56] go therein.
[2:37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:58] But narrow is the way,
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; straight is the gate
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; that leads to eternal life.
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; God bless you all today.
[2:38:10] [snorts]
[2:38:18] If I preach the legalism of this
[2:38:20] message, it just makes you harder.
[2:38:25] That's all it does.
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:38:28] Preach to your kids the law
[2:38:31] and they'll rebuild.
[2:38:33] &gt;&gt; Preach to them the love of Jesus Christ
[2:38:36] and get them to fall in love with him.
[2:38:39] You don't have to preach the law
[2:38:40] anymore. You know what
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; the love of God compels them? Because
[2:38:44] Jesus said, "What's the difference
[2:38:46] between them and you?
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; If you love me,
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; you keep my commandments."
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; That's all. That's what happened to me
[2:38:57] years ago. 18 year old boy. I fell in
[2:39:00] love with him.
[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; I didn't know what I was doing. I still
[2:39:06] don't know what I'm doing.
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; All I know I fell in love with him.
[2:39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:14] And the Apostle Paul with all that he
[2:39:17] did,
[2:39:18] the wife and I were reading the other
[2:39:20] day said, "Five times
[2:39:23] I've been beaten
[2:39:26] with 40 stripes, save one." Five times.
[2:39:30] Three times I've been
[2:39:34] hit with rods.
[2:39:36] Three times shipwrecked.
[2:39:38] in danger of false brethren,
[2:39:41] in danger of peril.
[2:39:44] He goes on and on. I thought, you know
[2:39:48] what? My my wife said,
[2:39:51] "Ron,
[2:39:52] what do you think Paul's back looked
[2:39:54] like?
[2:39:59] What do you think his back looked like?
[2:40:05] He bore the scars of what he believed in
[2:40:08] his body
[2:40:11] and he loved God with a ferveny. And the
[2:40:14] more they tried to beat it out of him,
[2:40:17] the more resolve he had.
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; What a man. I can't wait to see Paul.
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can't wait to see brother
[2:40:25] Brandham. Amen.
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; Can't wait to see those saints
[2:40:29] &gt;&gt; to embrace them and say, "What did I do?
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; What did I do in this day?" Not much
[2:40:37] really. Not compared to any of those
[2:40:40] guys.
[2:40:41] &gt;&gt; But I do want to be say to be said of
[2:40:44] me, "Enter in my good and faithful
[2:40:47] servant.
[2:40:49] &gt;&gt; Enter into the joys of the Lord."
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; So whatever I've got to do, let me do it
[2:40:54] with all I have.
[2:40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not with lip service,
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; but with a passion and a fortitude.
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; And let me be so on fire with God.
[2:41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to be some lukewarm.
[2:41:15] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:41:17] Let me fall in love with you.
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, falling in love. stand this morning
[2:41:24] with Jesus. [singing]
[2:41:26] [music]
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; Falling in [singing] love

[2:42:26] Falling in love [music and singing]
[2:42:29] with Jesus.
[2:42:33] Falling in love
[2:42:36] with [music and singing] Jesus
