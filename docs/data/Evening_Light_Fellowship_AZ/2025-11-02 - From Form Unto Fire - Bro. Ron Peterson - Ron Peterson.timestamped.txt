[6:07] gathered in his presence.
[6:09] &gt;&gt; As we go to the Lord in prayer this
[6:11] morning, let's sing, "Heal me, oh Lord,
[6:13] &gt;&gt; and I will be healed. Save me and I will
[6:16] be saved." How many have a need upon
[6:17] your heart this morning? Just want to
[6:19] lift that to him. Hold that need before
[6:20] the Lord as we sing this this morning.
[6:23] Heal me, [music]

[6:58] [music]
[6:59] I pray.
[7:04] Yes, you are
[7:06] the one. [music]
[7:08] Lift your knee to him as we sing it one
[7:10] more time.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; Heal me,
[7:17] oh [music and singing] Lord,
[7:19] and I will be [singing and music]
[7:22] healed.
[7:25] Save me
[7:27] and I [singing and music] will be saved.
[7:33] [music]
[7:35] Heal me,
[7:38] oh Lord,
[7:40] [music] and I [singing] will
[7:43] be healed.
[7:46] You are
[7:48] the [music and singing] one
[7:50] I pray.
[7:55] Oh, you are [singing and music]
[7:58] the one
[8:00] I pray.
[8:05] Amen.
[8:09] Ruben Johnson says, "We want to thank
[8:11] the Lord for watching over Lucas. He had
[8:14] his appendix removed Thursday. So, we
[8:16] just pray the Lord continue to be with
[8:18] Lucas, grant him a complete recovery.
[8:22] the Lord be with him.
[8:25] [snorts] Sister Sister Josie is thank
[8:28] you for all the prayers for my brother
[8:29] Arthur Banks. He's a lot better from his
[8:32] sickness. Still in hospice, but the
[8:35] prayers are welcomed. He is more at
[8:38] peace.
[8:40] Pray the Lord continue to be with sister
[8:42] Joseph's brother Arthur and just be with
[8:44] him in his time of need.
[8:47] Brother John McCaffrey, he wants to
[8:50] express his sincere and humble thanks to
[8:52] God for giving me a new job this past
[8:54] week. So, just thankful for what the
[8:56] Lord did for brother John. He meets our
[8:58] needs no matter what it might be. Amen.
[9:02] Got a note here this morning. I'm not
[9:03] too sure who it's from, but it says,
[9:05] "Please pray for a healing touch for my
[9:07] mom. She's been having flu-l like
[9:09] symptoms.
[9:10] Pray the Lord gives her faith for a
[9:12] complete healing." So, let's pray for
[9:13] this one. Lord knows who it is. Brother
[9:16] Billy Silva woke up and not feeling well
[9:18] this morning. Let's remember brother
[9:19] Billy in prayer and brother Mario Chua
[9:22] is preaching in Ottawa, Canada today and
[9:25] then next weekend he'll be preaching in
[9:27] Petroleia, Canada. So let's pray for
[9:29] brother Mario while he's away. Brother
[9:30] Johnny Green, would you come this
[9:32] morning? Brother Johnny and take us to
[9:34] the Lord in prayer. Pray for our service
[9:36] today. Our pastor says he feels burdened
[9:38] and so I know if Lord's put a burden
[9:40] upon his heart, there's a need. So pray
[9:42] the Lord would just speak to each one.
[9:44] If you have a need this morning, just
[9:45] lift before the Lord as brother Johnny
[9:47] prays.
[9:48] God bless you.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; How many here today would say with an
[9:56] uplifted hand, if I had an opportunity,
[9:58] I got a lot of testimonies to share.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Isn't that
[10:06] wonderful?
[10:07] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're so grateful that you're
[10:11] still Jehovah Gyra.
[10:13] &gt;&gt; You still provide our need. You've never
[10:16] failed us. You never will fail us. You
[10:19] promise that that I'll be with you, even
[10:21] in you, to the end of the world. We
[10:24] stand here, Lord God, because of your
[10:26] amazing grace. We're here to say that we
[10:29] love you and praise you. We're here to
[10:32] give you glory and honor. Lord, I'm so
[10:35] thankful, Father, that you have given us
[10:38] eternal life. You've given us eternity
[10:41] to praise you and to worship you, Lord.
[10:44] And we're so thankful, dear God, this
[10:46] morning that we can come before you with
[10:48] these needs, Lord. And we know that,
[10:51] Father, you're mindful of every single
[10:53] one of them. This Arthur Banks that's in
[10:55] the hospice, Lord. We know that you're
[10:57] moving in his life. And I pray that you
[11:00] would continue to answer Sister Jos's
[11:02] prayer for him. And for those, Father
[11:04] God, that have come through many trials
[11:07] and many tests. Lord, we're here today
[11:09] to say thank you for once again meeting
[11:11] our needs. Lord, we just want to say we
[11:14] love you.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; We want to praise you, Lord. [music] We
[11:18] pray this morning, Lord, as our pastor
[11:20] comes or whoever speaks the word that
[11:23] Lord, you would just get us out of the
[11:25] way so that your word can have free
[11:26] course in our life. Thank you for all of
[11:29] our brothers and sisters who have
[11:31] labored so much, Lord, for Friday
[11:33] night's family night. And for this
[11:36] morning, Lord, after service, we're
[11:38] having a meal together, Lord. And we
[11:40] thank you for all of those that have put
[11:42] their shoulder to the wheel to see that
[11:44] these things happen, Lord. Bless them.
[11:46] Bless them mightily, Lord. And so,
[11:49] Father, we just look to you again and
[11:51] say thank you for meeting every single
[11:53] need in the midst of your people. We
[11:55] want to give you honor and glory in
[11:57] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Johnny. You may be
[12:03] seated this morning. Want to welcome
[12:04] each one into the house of the Lord. If
[12:06] you're here visiting this morning, we
[12:08] welcome you.
[12:10] Got some visitors from
[12:14] Canada this morning, but brother Vish
[12:16] and sister Cindy
[12:18] Heers, I hope I'm saying that correctly,
[12:20] but they're from Grace Message
[12:22] Tabernacle of Ontario, Canada. Brother
[12:24] John Denqua is our pastor. So, it's good
[12:26] to have them here this morning.
[12:28] Also, it's good to have brother Dennis,
[12:29] Sister Bonnie back with us. And if
[12:32] you're here visiting, we don't have your
[12:33] name. We just welcome you and welcome
[12:35] our unseen audience as well. I believe
[12:38] my mother might be streaming the service
[12:40] this morning, so I welcome her as well.
[12:42] And as brother Johnny mentioned, we'll
[12:44] be having a lunchon right after service
[12:46] today. And all are welcome. I think
[12:49] there's plenty of food. So everybody's
[12:52] welcome to come. We will be having a
[12:53] baptism right after service and that'll
[12:55] be in the front. And so we'll all go out
[12:58] after service for the baptism. And then
[12:59] after the baptism, we're all going to
[13:01] circle around this way. We're going to
[13:03] go through the side side gate into the
[13:06] back. And then there will be three lines
[13:07] for for serving. Pastor did say if you
[13:10] come in any other way, you're going to
[13:12] be put at the back of the line. So be
[13:14] sure you follow the directions
[13:18] and then let's since it's in honor of
[13:20] ministry appreciation, let's make sure
[13:22] that the ministry gets to go first and
[13:24] we'll let our seniors follow after that.
[13:26] And families, if you could please
[13:28] monitor your children, help them serve
[13:29] up their portions.
[13:32] We don't want to be wasteful, but we do
[13:33] have plenty of food, but we want to
[13:35] prudent. And then there are some coolers
[13:38] with a lot of drinks in there. And so
[13:40] just be mindful of your children that
[13:42] they don't start a drink and then just
[13:44] leave it sitting around. So just pay
[13:46] attention to that. But we'll announce
[13:47] this again at the end of service. Amen.
[13:49] How many are happy in the Lord this
[13:51] morning? Happy to be here. Amen. Just
[13:53] over in the glory land. I've got a home
[13:56] prepared.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:02] I'm a home [music]
[14:04] prepare where the saints abide.

[17:13] cometh no night.

[26:54] not when they go through the testing.
[26:56] And I just want to sing this song this

[27:00] grew up on the song and uh but I heard
[27:02] it the other day and it really touched
[27:03] me. So I'm just going to sing it with
[27:05] you guys.
[27:20] It's not hard to believe
[27:24] when you're standing [singing and music]
[27:25] on the mountain top of glory.
[27:35] When you can hear the
[27:36] [music and singing] songs of angels in
[27:39] the breeze
[27:41] from heaven [singing] sends [music] you
[27:43] sorry.
[27:49] Oh, but in the [music and singing]
[27:50] valley once more
[27:53] will Jesus be Lord? Oh, that's the
[27:57] question.
[28:00] [music]
[28:04] believing [music]
[28:06] when believing isn't easy.
[28:10] That is [music] the testing.
[28:17] Oh, and I need faith for the times
[28:21] [music]
[28:22] when the sun [singing] does not shine
[28:26] and [music] the mountain top is just a
[28:29] memory.
[28:32] When [music] there no [singing] sign to
[28:35] be seen
[28:37] and [music] I don't feel a thing to the
[28:41] word of God alone [singing]
[28:43] I can cling
[28:47] and [music] I need faith for [singing]
[28:49] the day
[28:51] when [music] the troubles come my way
[28:55] and I just don't [music]
[28:57] understand
[28:58] what it means
[29:02] That's when nothing [music] else will
[29:04] do. I need the Lord to get me through.
[29:09] And believeing [music]
[29:11] becomes my victory.
[29:16] It's [music] not hard to believe
[29:20] when things are going [music]
[29:22] well and skies are sun.
[29:29] [music]
[29:30] Oh, when you can feel you're making
[29:33] progress, doing good
[29:36] and living in times [music]
[29:38] of plenty.
[29:44] Oh, but if [singing] all [music] of that
[29:47] should change,
[29:49] would you still keep [singing] the
[29:51] faith? Oh, that's the question.
[29:57] [music] Oh
[30:00] yeah. Believing when believing
[30:02] [music and singing]
[30:03] isn't easy.
[30:06] That is the testing. [music]
[30:10] You know this song. Just sing it with
[30:12] me. Oh, [singing] and I need [music]
[30:15] faith for the times when the sun does
[30:19] not shine
[30:21] and the mountain [singing] tops is just
[30:24] a memory.
[30:28] When there's [music] no sign to
[30:30] [singing] be seen
[30:32] and I don't feel a [music] thing to the
[30:36] word of God [singing] alone, I can't
[30:40] believe.
[30:42] Oh, and I [music and singing] need faith
[30:44] for the day when the troubles come my
[30:49] way and I just don't [music]
[30:52] understand
[30:54] what it means.
[30:57] That's when nothing [music] else will
[30:59] [singing] do.
[31:01] See the Lord to get me through.
[31:04] And believing [music]
[31:06] becomes my victory.
[31:10] Oh, and I need faith for the mountain
[31:17] [singing and music] shine.
[31:19] And the mountain top is just a memory.
[31:25] And there's no sign to [music] be seen.
[31:29] And I don't [singing]
[31:31] feel a thing to the word of God [music]
[31:35] alone. I can't clean.
[31:39] is I need faith for the day when [music]
[31:44] the troubles come my way. [singing] Oh,
[31:47] and I just don't understand
[31:50] what it means.
[31:54] When nothing else will do, I need the
[31:58] Lord to get me through.
[32:01] And believing [music]
[32:03] me comes my victory.
[32:06] Oh yes, that's when nothing else will
[32:10] do. I need the Lord to get me through
[32:15] and believe [music]
[32:17] [singing] becomes my victory.
[32:25] [applause]
[32:37] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[32:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you. This song is uh entitled
[32:45] God Sees the Storm from the Other Side.
[32:47] So, same same channel. So, God must have
[32:50] a message today. Amen.
[33:02] When the storm raged about them,
[33:07] the disciples were afraid.
[33:11] For the waves were high and the ship was
[33:15] tossed. They could not find their
[33:19] [singing]
[33:19] way.
[33:21] Then they awoke the master,
[33:26] saying, [music] "Lord, [singing]
[33:27] please save us now."
[33:30] He rebuked the winds and the sea grew
[33:34] calm. And they all [singing] wondered
[33:38] how
[33:43] God sees the storm from the other side.
[33:49] [singing]
[33:52] He knows the lessons learned.
[33:56] [music]
[33:56] And just [singing] beyond the clouds, he
[34:00] sees clear skies.
[34:06] He speaks peace to the raging storm.
[34:10] When peace cannot be found,
[34:14] he already [singing]
[34:16] sees the rainbow.
[34:19] When [music] we see only [singing]
[34:23] clouds,
[34:31] like the men [singing] on the sea,
[34:35] I have called on God in prayer.
[34:39] when it seemed [singing] to me all hope
[34:42] was gone. And [music] in my deep
[34:45] despair,
[34:47] I remember what the [singing] Lord said
[34:52] when he calmed that troubled sea.
[34:56] And I know once [singing] more he sees
[34:59] my storm and peace
[35:03] [singing] floods over me.
[35:09] God [singing] sees the storm [music]
[35:12] from the other side.
[35:17] He knows the lessons learned.
[35:21] And just [singing] beyond the clouds, he
[35:24] sees clear skies.
[35:29] He speaks peace to the raging storm.
[35:33] When peace cannot be found, [singing]
[35:37] he already sees the rainbow.
[35:42] When we see only clouds,
[35:48] when the storms of life come crashing
[35:52] [singing]
[35:52] in and trouble me,
[35:56] I can feel [singing] God's arms around
[35:59] me. And he whispers,
[36:02] [singing]
[36:03] "Just [music] let it be."
[36:10] God [singing] sees the storm from the
[36:13] other side.
[36:18] He knows [singing] the lessons learned.
[36:22] And just beyond the clouds, [singing] he
[36:25] sees clear skies.
[36:30] He speaks [singing] peace to the raging
[36:33] storm. When peace cannot [music]
[36:37] be found,
[36:39] he already sees the rainbow.
[36:43] When we see only clouds,
[36:50] he speaks peace to the raging storm.
[36:54] When peace cannot be found,
[36:59] he already [singing] sees the rainbow.
[37:04] When [music] we
[37:06] see [singing] all
[37:09] the clouds,
[37:16] [applause]
[37:22] thank you, Sister Jill, Justin.
[37:25] So glad that he's mindful of each one of
[37:27] us. I mean, let's all stand and we
[37:30] prepare to change the order of the
[37:31] service. I was just thinking of song. I
[37:33] know the master of the wind.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. My boat of life might be going
[37:37] down sometimes, but he's the one that
[37:40] can come calm the storm. Amen.
[37:45] My boat of life [singing]
[37:47] [music]
[37:48] sails on a troubled sea.
[37:53] Ever there's [music]
[37:54] a [singing] wind in my sail.
[37:59] [music]
[38:01] But I have a friend
[38:04] who's watching over [music] me
[38:09] when the grace [singing] turns in to a
[38:13] [music] king.
[38:17] I know [music and singing]
[38:18] the master of the way.
[38:25] I know the [singing] maker of the rain.
[38:28] [music]
[38:33] He can conquer the [music] storm and
[38:35] make the sun to shine again.
[38:41] I know the master of the wind.
[38:49] Sometimes I [music and singing] soar
[38:52] like an eagle to the high.
[38:56] Upon the [music and singing] peace my
[38:58] soul can be found.
[39:04] An unexpected storm
[39:07] may [music and singing] drive me from
[39:09] the height.
[39:11] May bring me low but it will never
[39:14] [music and singing] bring me down.
[39:20] I [music] know the master of the way.
[39:23] [singing]
[39:25] &gt;&gt; [music]
[39:28] &gt;&gt; I know the maker of the rain.
[39:33] [music]
[39:35] He can calm the [singing] storm and make
[39:38] the sun to shine again.
[39:43] I know the master of [music and singing]
[39:46] moon. One more time.
[39:51] I know the master of [music] the wind.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; I know [singing] the maker of the rain.
[40:03] [music]
[40:06] He can [singing] calm the storm to make
[40:09] the sun to shine again.
[40:13] [music and singing]
[40:14] I know the master of he can calm the
[40:18] soul.
[40:20] Oh,
[40:22] he can [music] cal [singing] your storm
[40:24] and make the sun to shine again. [music]
[40:30] I know the master [singing and music]
[40:33] of
[40:38] &gt;&gt; heavenly father
[40:40] truly that is our story.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:44] how that our [music] life is like a ship
[40:48] that is on a troubled sea.
[40:52] But Father, even as those that were
[40:54] crossing the Sea of Galilee one day and
[40:56] there come a great tempest and you were
[40:59] in the hinder part of the ship and you
[41:01] went to sleep and they let you go to
[41:04] sleep and they said, "Master, go ahead
[41:06] and rest yourself. We got this. We can
[41:10] take care of it."
[41:12] Father, sometimes that's how it is. We
[41:16] let you go to sleep and
[41:19] we kind of figure we can take care of
[41:21] ourselves and we we got it. But then we
[41:25] realize when the wind is t is strong and
[41:28] the waves are against us and it seems
[41:32] like our ship is going to sink, it's
[41:35] time to go wake up the master.
[41:38] Father, I
[41:39] &gt;&gt; ask you to come and
[41:41] &gt;&gt; walk these aisles today.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Speak to us. Father, I have something on
[41:46] my heart this morning. I pray, oh God,
[41:49] that you would come. Let the Holy Spirit
[41:51] have his way in this service today and
[41:54] most of all, draw us closer to you. I
[41:57] thank you. I praise you. I ask these
[42:00] things for your glory in the name of
[42:03] Jesus Christ.

[44:08] my time.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; I've got a lot on my plate this morning.
[44:12] I've had the Lord to deal with me in the
[44:15] last day or so and had a quiet time with
[44:18] him yesterday morning which just was
[44:21] such a refresher.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; You need those times. You know, you can
[44:26] pray, read, you can sing, you can read

[45:18] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I soar.
[45:21] Sometimes I [singing] soar
[45:24] like an eagle [music]
[45:25] through the high
[45:28] among the peaks my [singing] soul can be
[45:32] found
[45:35] in my unexpected storm [singing] may
[45:40] drive me from the high.
[45:43] It will bring me low [music and singing]
[45:45] but it will never bring me down.
[45:50] Oh,

[46:34] &gt;&gt; I know the maker of the rain.
[46:38] I've experienced you in my life in the
[46:40] good times and in the bad.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; And realize, Father, that through it
[46:45] all, it was you that was watching over
[46:47] me.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; I didn't keep you. You kept me. It
[46:51] wasn't my keeping your word. It was you
[46:54] keeping your covenant.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; For I will make a way for my children.
[47:00] For a place I've gone to prepare for
[47:02] you, that where I am, there you may be
[47:05] also. Father, I take comfort in those
[47:08] words. I pray now, Father, as I lay my
[47:12] hands upon your word.
[47:15] I ask for a great anointing.
[47:21] Let the author of that word that
[47:23] inspired the men of old to write these
[47:25] words,
[47:27] &gt;&gt; may that author come now,
[47:30] &gt;&gt; speak through my lips,
[47:33] &gt;&gt; hear through the hearer's ears.
[47:36] Let them hear what the spirit is saying
[47:38] to the church. Father, I thank you. I
[47:42] love you. I ask that you be with us now,
[47:45] Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank you,
[47:53] musicians, each and everyone. I enjoyed
[47:56] the song specials.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Both of them so very, very special to
[48:01] me. I appreciate it. Ezekiel chapter 20.
[48:06] Ezekiel chap 20
[48:09] verses 47 and 48. Then we'll go to
[48:12] Psalms chapter 83 and then to Hebrews
[48:16] 12.
[48:18] [snorts]
[48:25] Ezekiel chapter 20
[48:29] 47
[48:30] and 48.
[48:35] and say to the forest of the south, hear
[48:37] the word of the Lord. Thus sayaith the
[48:40] Lord God, behold, I will kindle a fire
[48:44] in thee,
[48:46] &gt;&gt; and it shall devour every green tree in
[48:49] thee, and every dry tree. The flaming
[48:52] fire shall not be quenched, and all the
[48:55] faces from the south to the north shall
[48:58] be burned therein,
[49:00] and all the flesh shall see that I, the
[49:03] Lord, have kindled it. It shall not
[49:08] be quenched.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Notice, I will kindle
[49:13] a fire
[49:15] &gt;&gt; in thee. [snorts]
[49:18] Psalms
[49:21] 83
[49:24] verse 14.
[49:29] As a fire burnth the wood
[49:34] and as the flame setth the mountains
[49:37] on fire.
[49:40] Turn with me now to the book of Hebrews
[49:44] chapter 12.
[49:49] Hebrews 12 verse 28 and 29. And if I
[49:54] would, I'd like all of us to read this
[49:57] in unison. Those of you that have your
[49:59] Bible, I'd like you to read from your
[50:00] Bible. Those of you don't read it from
[50:02] the overhead.
[50:04] Uh so let's read this all together.
[50:07] Verse 28 of Hebrews 12. Wherefore we
[50:12] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[50:14] moved, let us have grace whereby we may
[50:18] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[50:22] godly fear. For our God is a consuming
[50:26] fire.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word.
[50:29] You may be speeded
[50:31] seated this morning
[50:34] in his presence.
[50:40] I'd like to
[50:42] title my sermon
[50:45] as an opposite of what I preached on
[50:47] this past Wednesday.
[50:50] This past Wednesday, it was more of an
[50:52] informative service. And I want to say
[50:56] it was as though I couldn't get into the
[50:58] channel.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; And I always take it unto myself. If I
[51:03] think, well, maybe I haven't been prayed
[51:05] up and not seeking you like I should.
[51:09] And then I also want to share that with
[51:12] you and say, maybe you haven't.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; I need your help.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; If you don't pray, God don't speak.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; So, I need your help. So I went from
[51:29] fire
[51:32] unto form
[51:35] and
[51:37] I was taking it from where the prophet
[51:40] of God
[51:43] and we he spoke this in uh the seven
[51:47] church age book
[51:50] and this is the quote
[51:54] which inspired me to take this
[51:57] direction. Ephesian church age, brother
[52:00] Brandham said that cycle of revival and
[52:02] death has never failed.
[52:06] Revival
[52:08] and death
[52:10] has never failed.
[52:12] All you have to do is to recall the last
[52:15] move of God in the spirit when men and
[52:17] women dressed like Christians,
[52:22] went to church,
[52:25] prayed all night, took the street
[52:27] corners, and weren't ashamed of the
[52:30] manifestation
[52:32] of God of the spirit.
[52:34] They left their old dead churches and
[52:36] worshiped in homes and old store
[52:39] buildings.
[52:40] They had reality.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't too long until they began
[52:47] to get enough money to build fine new
[52:50] churches.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; They put in a choir instead of singing
[52:54] unto God for themselves.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; They put gowns on the choir. They
[53:01] organized a movement and ran it by man.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; They soon began to read books that
[53:06] weren't fit to read.
[53:09] They let down the bars and goats came in
[53:12] and took over.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; The cry of joy was gone and the freedom
[53:17] of the spirit was gone.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, they kept on with a form,
[53:26] &gt;&gt; but the fire had died down
[53:29] &gt;&gt; and the blackness of ashes is about all
[53:33] that was left.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; And it took me as Sandy and I, my wife
[53:40] and I, in our morning devotions and I
[53:43] began to weep when I read that. I said,
[53:46] Sandy,
[53:48] it went from the reality of the spirit
[53:51] of God moving,
[53:54] &gt;&gt; from fire to a form,
[53:57] &gt;&gt; a religion, a
[54:01] &gt;&gt; a way of life,
[54:04] &gt;&gt; a keeping of the law, and no sincerity.
[54:08] in
[54:10] &gt;&gt; pretty soon. There are just a few ashes
[54:14] about all that is left.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; So today, I don't want to leave you on a
[54:22] negative note, but a positive.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; So I want to go from form unto fire
[54:36] &gt;&gt; and
[54:39] Today I want to speak about fire
[54:44] &gt;&gt; and how that God is likened unto fire.
[54:49] And there are many things that the Bible
[54:53] uses
[54:54] that types God.
[54:57] God is like a lion, king of the jungle,
[55:00] and when he roars, let everyone take
[55:03] heed.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; He is likened unto an eagle.
[55:08] that flies above the trials with the
[55:10] wings of faith. He is likened unto a
[55:13] lamb who is the supreme sacrifice of
[55:17] God.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; He is like the gentle dove
[55:22] who is meek and lonely.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says that he also is a
[55:27] consuming fire.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; The word fire appears 540 times within
[55:35] your Bible.
[55:38] And nearly every time that fire is
[55:40] mentioned, God is in it
[55:46] &gt;&gt; because our God
[55:48] &gt;&gt; is a consuming fire.
[55:52] Absolutely.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; So I want to go from form unto fire and
[55:57] I want to talk about the God that
[55:58] answers by fire.
[56:03] And
[56:05] fire represents many things within the
[56:08] scripture. And it represents several of
[56:10] these things. And I shall attempt to go
[56:14] through some of these to let you realize
[56:17] that what God has done in this hour
[56:22] is to not just set up church order,
[56:25] &gt;&gt; but to establish a relationship with you
[56:29] as the believer.
[56:32] Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Fire represents his presence.
[56:38] Fire represents his voice.
[56:43] Fire represents his judgment and
[56:45] displeasure.
[56:47] Fire also
[56:50] represents his acceptance and approval.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:54] God likens unto his spirit baptism with
[56:57] that of a baptism
[57:00] of fire.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:07] So there are properties associated with
[57:10] fire that God wants you to understand
[57:13] that you might know a little bit more of
[57:14] his characteristics.
[57:19] Whenever we go to sterilize a needle
[57:22] that you're going to use to perhaps
[57:24] puncture a blister or a wound that you
[57:26] have, you sterilize it with a fire.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; You sterilize a knife if you're going to
[57:34] use it. If you have nothing else, you're
[57:36] going to sterilize that knife with fire.
[57:41] You sterilize tools that's used in the
[57:45] medical field in an enclave
[57:50] which puts it under extreme heat. And
[57:53] there's nothing like fire and heat that
[57:56] kills the germs.
[58:02] Fire and water are the two most
[58:04] cleansing elements known to mankind.
[58:10] God lets you go and to get baptized.
[58:13] When you get baptized with water, it
[58:15] signifies the cleansing of the sacrifice
[58:19] before it's consumed.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; So there's a difference between the
[58:25] water baptism, okay, which is your works
[58:28] unto God, and the baptism of fire, which
[58:32] is God consuming your sacrifice and his
[58:35] works to you. GOD SAYING, "I ACCEPT THIS
[58:38] SACRIFICE." YES,
[58:40] &gt;&gt; SIR.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; SO, I ask all of you that have been
[58:43] baptized in water.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Have you been baptized by fire?
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Well, I didn't know there was such a
[58:52] thing. Well, then how was you baptized?
[58:54] Well, holding your head high, I was
[58:57] baptized as the prophet said, unto the
[59:01] name of THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. BUT
[59:02] THAT'S unto repentance.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; For did not Jesus say or John say about
[59:10] Jesus THAT THERE'S ONE COMING AFTER ME
[59:14] &gt;&gt; WHOSE BAPTISM IS FAR GREATER.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; FOR I TRULY BAPTIZE YOU UNTO REPENTANCE,
[59:21] &gt;&gt; but the one coming after me shall truly
[59:24] baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire.
[59:34] The Holy Ghost is not only to consume
[59:37] your sacrifice,
[59:39] but it is to be a divine sign to you
[59:42] that God has accepted your sacrifice.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; There is something about fire that is
[59:54] inspiring and thoughtprovoking. We've
[59:57] all set around a fire. We've all gone
[59:59] camping and you make a nice old fire.
[1:00:01] Not some little tiny thing here that you
[1:00:04] can't really get warm by.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Just let the Love All Boys put together
[1:00:08] a fire for you. And I tell you, you're
[1:00:10] going to have a fire. They they they cut
[1:00:12] them logs and Ethan Stanky carries them
[1:00:16] like that. And then he they take them,
[1:00:18] they cut them up, they shout, and we
[1:00:19] have a fire.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; There's nothing like a fire. You can
[1:00:24] look into it AND YOU CAN QUIT TALKING.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO say nothing. Just sit
[1:00:28] there and look,
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; crackle and pop and you see the flames
[1:00:33] and the fire. And there is something
[1:00:35] thought provoking
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; about looking into fire. Why? BECAUSE
[1:00:39] IT'S GOT A PROPERTY of God. YOU LOOK
[1:00:41] INTO FIRE, THERE'S something that has an
[1:00:44] affinity that you can relate with.
[1:00:51] There's nothing like a good old
[1:00:53] Christian that's got a fire in the
[1:00:54] hearth.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Not a forced air heater,
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; but a real glow of the Holy Spirit on
[1:01:02] the inside.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; I used to heat my house in Flagstaff
[1:01:06] with nothing but wood. And we had a big
[1:01:08] old wooden fireplace. And I I tell you,
[1:01:11] I would stoke it up at night and I put
[1:01:13] different kinds of wood in there knowing
[1:01:15] that oak is going to last longer than
[1:01:18] than the pine and the aspen.
[1:01:22] I would stoke it up and then I'd damp it
[1:01:24] down and in the mornings it might be a
[1:01:28] little cool, but I would go and look and
[1:01:29] see, is there any fire left in the
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; And then I'd open up the dampers and
[1:01:34] open up the fluid a little bit, open the
[1:01:36] door just a little bit, and all of a
[1:01:38] sudden
[1:01:40] Throw a couple logs ON THE FIRE. YOU got
[1:01:42] to refuel your fire.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; All of you have got to refuel the fire
[1:01:52] of the Holy Spirit in your life. It's
[1:01:55] not just a ONE TIME BAPTISM, BUT A
[1:01:58] BAPTISM UPON BAPTISM.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. It's a continual stoking the fire.
[1:02:04] WHY? BECAUSE BURN, BURN, HOLY SPIRIT.
[1:02:08] BURN in me.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Set my soul on fire.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that God would rather you
[1:02:19] be hot or cold.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; And I've thought about I don't want to
[1:02:24] try to just have a painted fire.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; I don't want to talk about a fire. You
[1:02:29] can't get warm by a painted fire.
[1:02:32] So let's not use religious ways and
[1:02:36] different things to paint a picture
[1:02:38] about how God is a fire. But may there
[1:02:42] be a reality of the fire of God burning
[1:02:46] within each one of us.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; A fire can be dangerous
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; if it gets out of control.
[1:02:57] If it's not handled properly, it can
[1:03:00] rage out of control and cause more
[1:03:03] destruction than good.
[1:03:06] We always tell OUR CHILDREN, DON'T YOU
[1:03:07] PLAY WITH fire
[1:03:11] because you know that if your children
[1:03:13] are just they're mesmerized by fire and
[1:03:16] matches, they might start the whole
[1:03:18] house on fire. In fact, throughout this
[1:03:20] city, every every week, the fire
[1:03:23] departments are going somewhere and
[1:03:26] putting out a fire because somebody was
[1:03:29] playing with it.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; God help us to never play with the fire
[1:03:34] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Fire makes things move.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You ever walk barefoot and step on
[1:03:48] a cigarette that somebody had thrown on
[1:03:50] the ground. I'll tell you, you'll Yeah,
[1:03:54] you'll move real quick. I've done it
[1:03:56] several times.
[1:03:59] Do you know it's against the law to yell
[1:04:01] fire in a crowded theater
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; when there's a fire raging in a,
[1:04:11] let's say, a high-rise building or some
[1:04:14] big tower like the Twin Towers.
[1:04:17] See, it wasn't just the airplane crashed
[1:04:19] into the Twin Towers there that day, but
[1:04:23] it was the fire
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; that set the place ablaze.
[1:04:28] And I don't know if any of you have seen
[1:04:30] the people jumping to their death
[1:04:32] because they'd rather jump from the fire
[1:04:35] than to be consumed by it.
[1:04:40] Fire makes things move. Now, brother
[1:04:43] Brennham uses and it's quite a a a funny
[1:04:48] little story, but brother Brennham uses
[1:04:50] the natural as a type of the spiritual
[1:04:53] and he takes in the uncertain sound. He
[1:04:56] says, "Brethren, men of God, women of
[1:04:58] God, what's the matter with us? There's
[1:05:01] something needs to move."
[1:05:04] He says, "We're turtling."
[1:05:07] When I was a little boy, you know what a
[1:05:09] turtle is? A tortoise.
[1:05:11] We have them back east. An old terrapin
[1:05:14] and we called him. And me and my brother
[1:05:17] saw one one time was a little bitty
[1:05:19] fella. And the funniest looking thing
[1:05:21] you ever seen. He was moving like that.
[1:05:24] And when we got him, he went shooked and
[1:05:27] drawed up. Just reminded me of some
[1:05:30] people
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; preaching the gospel to him.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'll watch some of your reaction.
[1:05:39] Uh here he goes getting on me again. You
[1:05:43] tuck your [laughter] head back. That's
[1:05:45] okay. But listen what he said. You go to
[1:05:48] throwing the gospel out and they say the
[1:05:51] the the days of miracles have passed. No
[1:05:53] such thing as that old turtle. You know
[1:05:56] what I said? I I think I'll make him
[1:05:59] walk.
[1:06:00] I went over and got him got me a switch
[1:06:02] and began to whip him. That didn't do no
[1:06:05] good. I just whipped him. He just
[1:06:07] smothered up. You can beat them, whip
[1:06:10] them,
[1:06:12] do anything you want to, and you won't
[1:06:15] do a bit of good. I said, I'll fix him.
[1:06:18] I took him down to the creek, and then I
[1:06:20] baptized him.
[1:06:23] [snorts] Put him under the water till
[1:06:24] bubbles all bubbled up. That's all there
[1:06:27] was to to him. Water never done it. You
[1:06:31] might as well quit your fussing. I just
[1:06:33] held him there until all the bubbles had
[1:06:35] bubble, bubble, bubble. He never want
[1:06:37] done a thing. But you know what I did? I
[1:06:40] got me a piece of paper and built me a
[1:06:42] little fire.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Set the old boy on it. He walked in.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; That's what we need tonight.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[1:06:53] fire.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Not so much church creed back in the
[1:06:58] thing back like the forefathers had it.
[1:07:01] We need another Pentecost who will line
[1:07:04] you up with the Holy Ghost. It'll send
[1:07:06] people to their knees, send people to
[1:07:08] their Bibles to search the scripture and
[1:07:10] look for them.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we need. Not not
[1:07:15] turtle religion.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; We need a religion that'll make us move.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Fire in the scripture is used many
[1:07:24] times.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Fire represents his presence. Yes.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Mo Moses noticed the bush on fire one
[1:07:35] day
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; and it was not consumed. It got his
[1:07:39] attraction.
[1:07:41] It got his attention and it attracted
[1:07:44] him. And the Bible says that when he
[1:07:47] stepped aside
[1:07:49] and went to see why the bush was not
[1:07:51] consumed.
[1:07:53] I want you to understand that there are
[1:07:54] attractions that God will put in your
[1:07:57] life to cause you to stop and to look.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; But he wants to get your attention more
[1:08:03] than just why is the bush not being
[1:08:06] consumed.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; He came into the presence of God. In
[1:08:11] fact, when he did, he come close to that
[1:08:14] pillar of fire. Can you imagine? Now,
[1:08:16] here is Moses.
[1:08:18] He doesn't really know
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; about his calling.
[1:08:23] He doesn't really know. He He just knows
[1:08:25] he's a proper child. He's been told that
[1:08:28] by his mother, kicked out by Pharaoh and
[1:08:31] on and he's on the back side of the
[1:08:33] desert. And he sees a bush that's on
[1:08:36] fire.
[1:08:38] And he comes into the presence of that
[1:08:40] fire and he the closer he gets the more
[1:08:44] he feels something supernatural
[1:08:47] until the voice speaks and said Moses
[1:08:49] Moses.
[1:08:51] Take off your shoes for the ground that
[1:08:53] thou standest on is holy ground.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to understand that
[1:08:58] picture right now. And it took a prophet
[1:09:00] of God for him to explain it to us. And
[1:09:03] he said that prophet came into the
[1:09:05] presence of God. And he says the
[1:09:08] presence of God is what changed the life
[1:09:11] of Moses.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; He says that he actually entered into
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; the pillar of fire.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, let me tell you,
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; I don't WANT TO JUST TALK ABOUT THIS
[1:09:28] MESSAGE. AMEN.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO JUST HAVE IT TO BE an
[1:09:33] attraction. Oh, there's something about
[1:09:35] it. But God, allow me to enter into THAT
[1:09:39] PILLAR OF FIRE.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; LET ME GET INTO IT. LET ME GET UNDER THE
[1:09:42] INSPIRATION. LET IT DO SOMETHING TO ME.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; It caused an attraction for Moses.
[1:09:56] He came into the presence of God. was
[1:09:58] never the same.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Even those on the day of Pentecost and
[1:10:06] they were gathered together in an upper
[1:10:07] room.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; And Jesus had told the disciples to go
[1:10:12] into Jerusalem and tar there until you
[1:10:15] were endued with power from on high. And
[1:10:17] the Bible says, "And the day of
[1:10:18] Pentecost was fully come."
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; And they were all in one mind and one
[1:10:24] accord.
[1:10:25] And there came a sound from heaven
[1:10:29] as a rushing
[1:10:31] mighty wind
[1:10:34] and cloven tongues of fire fell upon
[1:10:37] each one.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says, "Now you watch
[1:10:40] here, the Holy Spirit, which is the
[1:10:43] pillar of fire, broke himself up
[1:10:47] and he sat upon each one of them."
[1:10:50] I want you to understand that that's
[1:10:52] what God wants to do with each one of
[1:10:54] you is he WANTS TO SIT ON YOU. He wants
[1:10:57] to get your life on fire for him.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; He wants TO GET YOU INVOLVED. I DON'T
[1:11:04] WANT YOU TO JUST BE A SPECTATOR,
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; BUT A PARTICIPATOR.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT YOU TO SIT IN THE BENCH.
[1:11:11] GET IN THE GAME.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. [applause]
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:11:18] Bless the Lord.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; When they came under the influence of a
[1:11:23] fire on each one of them,
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; they began to move.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Fear left them.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; The door that they had locked for fear
[1:11:32] of the Jews, now they unlocked. THEY
[1:11:34] KICKED IT OPEN.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; THEY WENT OUT INTO THE STREETS
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; AND THEY BEGAN TO MAGNIFY. THEY WERE NO
[1:11:40] LONGER ASHAMED. THEY WERE NO LONGER
[1:11:42] FEARFUL. THAT'S WHAT THE HOLY GHOST WILL
[1:11:44] DO FOR YOU. IT'LL PUT YOU ON FIRE. IT'LL
[1:11:47] TAKE AWAY ANY SHAME, ANY REPROACH.
[1:11:51] YOU'LL GLADLY BEAR IT.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Prove me wrong.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Try it one time.
[1:12:08] [snorts]
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; The fire that Moses saw was just one
[1:12:12] bush and on a mountain side.
[1:12:16] But that experience CAUSED HIM TO GO
[1:12:18] BACK AND GET THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND
[1:12:20] COME BACK TO MOUNT SI. AND THIS TIME IT
[1:12:22] WASN'T JUST A BUSH.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; The whole [screaming] mountain
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; was on fire.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Behold, what a great fire
[1:12:36] a flame does kindle.
[1:12:40] Moses then received a message of fire
[1:12:44] and the end time prophet received a
[1:12:47] message from the pillar of fire. One was
[1:12:51] Moses on Mount Si
[1:12:54] and here was the prophet in our day on
[1:12:57] Mount Sunset.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; This is a message of fire.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Don't play with it.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Children of Israel saw the fire of God
[1:13:14] on Mount Si.
[1:13:17] It was moved by earthquakes
[1:13:20] and by thunderings and by voices
[1:13:25] and the top of the whole mountain was on
[1:13:27] fire.
[1:13:30] Whenever you see the pillar of fire, I
[1:13:33] want all of you to understand you will
[1:13:35] find God's voice.
[1:13:39] and you will see God's presence.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to take it from what
[1:13:45] happened back then to bring it DOWN TO
[1:13:47] TODAY BECAUSE WHAT GOOD IS A GOD OF
[1:13:49] HISTORY?
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; But let us bring a God out of history
[1:13:53] down into a
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; into our day.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; For Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:14:03] today, and forever. That's right.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; When Moses came down off of the mountain
[1:14:11] and from the presence of God, he walked
[1:14:14] among the people
[1:14:16] and his face did shine.
[1:14:19] It had
[1:14:23] such an effect
[1:14:27] that the people were even afraid to look
[1:14:29] upon the face of Moses
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; because he showed
[1:14:36] with the glory of God.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; He had to veil himself.
[1:14:42] THEY SAID, "OH, GOD, DON'T LET MOSES
[1:14:44] SPEAK because he's such a reflection."
[1:14:48] He said, "Then I'll use his his brother
[1:14:52] Aaron to be his mouthpiece."
[1:14:58] When Moses heard the voice speak from
[1:15:02] the fire, it ignited a fire in him.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; It sparked something WITHIN MOSES. DO
[1:15:12] YOU KNOW WHAT spontaneous combustion is?
[1:15:15] If any of you ever took shop class,
[1:15:17] whether it's automotive or woodworking
[1:15:19] or anything like that, you have certain
[1:15:21] conditions that's called spontaneous
[1:15:24] combustion. You take an old oiled rag or
[1:15:27] something with with some flammable
[1:15:30] material and you put the rags in the
[1:15:31] corner or whatever and if the
[1:15:33] temperature becomes right,
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO ME. HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; IF THE MATERIAL IS COMBUSTIBLE AND THE
[1:15:41] CONDITIONS
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; WILL GET RIGHT,
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; THAT CONDITION WILL CAUSE
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; SPONTANEOUS
[1:15:51] FLAME ON. Y
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; so it is with you.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE OF the same material that the
[1:16:01] pillar of fire
[1:16:03] is used as a combustion
[1:16:06] s
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; that you get around it.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; you'll catch fire.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:24] Same thing happens to a person today.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; If you come into the presence of God,
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; it'll change you.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; That's what I desire as a pastor to see
[1:16:37] each one of you
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; not to experience God through knowledge,
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; through learning,
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; huh, through teaching of good
[1:16:45] ministries. Nothing wrong with that,
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; but that'll just cause you to be
[1:16:51] religious,
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; to conform,
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; TO WEAR A DRESS WITHOUT A message
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; that it is holiness to you.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; It's just a long dress.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Fact, the Muslims got us beat. Y
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; if covering completely makes you holy,
[1:17:14] why then you ought to wear a burka and
[1:17:16] just have this little thing like that
[1:17:17] and walk around. Huh? So you don't even
[1:17:20] show your shoes.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; So it's not the dress that makes you
[1:17:26] holy.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; You brethren, it is not your walk with
[1:17:30] GOD ON HOW GOOD YOU keep the
[1:17:31] commandments that makes you RIGHTEOUS
[1:17:34] BEFORE GOD. BUT IT'S WHEN GOD REVEALS TO
[1:17:37] YOU from his word
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; AND YOU START WALKING IN THE REVELATION
[1:17:41] THAT GOD GAVE YOU, GOD SAYS THAT'S
[1:17:44] RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; And he receives it.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; absolutely.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Fire represents his voice.
[1:17:54] God always speaks from the midst of
[1:17:56] fire.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Not to give them some show or some kind
[1:18:01] of entertainment
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; or make them get emotional jumping and
[1:18:06] shouting, though there's nothing wrong
[1:18:08] with that. In fact, Brother Bram said,
[1:18:10] "I'd rather have a little wildfire than
[1:18:11] no fire at all."
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; He says, "Show me a church that's
[1:18:15] popping and jumping." And he says rather
[1:18:18] than one who's cold for formal and
[1:18:21] starchy and just sits there frozen to
[1:18:24] death.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; I think Ernie Villain Noea Villan Noeva
[1:18:30] labeled them the frozen chosen.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; God don't ever let us yet to become cold
[1:18:37] and formal.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Having a form.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I sat around the fire one time
[1:18:43] as a young boy and we we had the little
[1:18:45] hot dogs and we had the marshmallows and
[1:18:47] we put them in the fire with a coat
[1:18:49] hanger. You know, you've all done that.
[1:18:51] And had the coat hanger. When I got
[1:18:53] done, I had no more marshmallows or
[1:18:55] something. So, I just played around
[1:18:56] poking that thing into the fire until I
[1:18:58] got that the end of that thing red hot.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Any of you ever done that? I got the
[1:19:04] thing red hot and I reached over and
[1:19:06] touched my buddy's arm just to see what
[1:19:08] it would do. He moved. All right. He's
[1:19:11] still got a scar. I I branded him.
[1:19:14] Look what you did to me years ago, man.
[1:19:16] I still got it.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, [laughter]
[1:19:21] if God ever touches you
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; with a fire from off of the coal, YOU'LL
[1:19:26] BE BRANDED.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; IF HE EVER TAKES THAT FIRE FROM OFF OF
[1:19:30] THE ALTAR AND PUTS IT UPON YOU,
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL NEVER BE THE SAME.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Fire represents his voice.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; 33 times in the Bible, it talks about
[1:19:49] the pillar of fire and it talks about
[1:19:51] the voice of God from the pillar of
[1:19:54] fire.
[1:19:57] God spoke to Moses from the midst of the
[1:20:00] fire.
[1:20:02] And Moses's mind, body, and soul
[1:20:07] was being cleansed.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; It was being purged by fire. Nothing
[1:20:14] more cleansing
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; than the fire of God.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; It was not speaking theological
[1:20:23] seminary.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the education of man.
[1:20:28] It wasn't some ecclesiastical bylaws and
[1:20:32] things that he had learned in school and
[1:20:35] made into dogmas and traditions,
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; but it was God speaking from the midst
[1:20:40] of the fire.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; I'll show you this in Deuteronomy
[1:20:44] chapter 4. Follow along with me.
[1:20:46] Deuteronomy 4 verses 11- 15. And ye came
[1:20:52] near and stood under the mountain. And
[1:20:54] the mountain burned with fire in the
[1:20:57] midst of heaven with darkness and clouds
[1:21:00] and thick darkness. And the Lord spake
[1:21:02] unto you out of the midst of the fire.
[1:21:06] You heard the voice of the words, but
[1:21:09] you saw no similitude. Only you heard a
[1:21:13] voice
[1:21:14] and declared he declared unto you his
[1:21:17] covenant. So this voice is speaking.
[1:21:20] It's got a purpose. God speaking from
[1:21:23] the midst of the fire. And you've heard
[1:21:26] it. You didn't see a similitude. LET ME
[1:21:29] TELL YOU, GOD works in supernatural
[1:21:31] realms. He real. He he he can do IT
[1:21:34] WITHOUT YOU SEEING HIM.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; And yet he can speak.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; He declared unto you the covenant
[1:21:43] which he commanded you to perform,
[1:21:46] even ten commandments. and he wrote them
[1:21:48] upon the tables of stone. And the Lord
[1:21:51] commanded me at that time to teach you
[1:21:53] statutes and judgments
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; that you might do them in the land
[1:21:57] whether you go over to possess it. So
[1:22:00] there's a purpose in this voice.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Take ye therefore good heed unto
[1:22:06] yourselves, for you saw no manner of
[1:22:09] similitude on the day that the Lord
[1:22:11] spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst
[1:22:14] of the fire. And the Lord thy God is a
[1:22:17] consuming fire. In fact, the word
[1:22:20] consuming fire is used three times in
[1:22:22] scripture. Two times the Old Testament,
[1:22:24] once in the New.
[1:22:31] Out of heaven, he made thee to hear his
[1:22:33] voice,
[1:22:37] that he might instruct thee. So there's
[1:22:40] a purpose for you to hear that voice. is
[1:22:43] for instruction.
[1:22:45] And he showed thee his great fire, that
[1:22:47] thou heardest his words out of the midst
[1:22:50] of the fire. God speaking to them not in
[1:22:54] an earthly voice, but a heavenly out of
[1:22:58] a out of a consuming fire.
[1:23:06] And Jeremiah
[1:23:08] saw this fire one time and it affected
[1:23:11] him. Jeremiah 20:9
[1:23:14] Then I said, I will not mention of him,
[1:23:17] nor speak anymore of his name, but his
[1:23:20] word was in my mind
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; as a burning fire
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; shut up within my bones.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; It affected him. Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you,
[1:23:35] has the word of God
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; in your life affected you so much that
[1:23:40] it shut up within your bones?
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; That you HAVE A FIRE INSIDE OF YOU.
[1:23:49] In prehistoric days, I just saw a
[1:23:52] documentary here
[1:23:54] a while ago that within every
[1:23:57] prehistoric tribe and different thing,
[1:24:00] they had a keeper of the flame.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; And he was an important guy because when
[1:24:08] they moved camp, you better take the
[1:24:09] fire with you. And he didn't have
[1:24:12] matches.
[1:24:14] They didn't have a simple way to start a
[1:24:16] fire. So he had to take coals and embers
[1:24:21] with him wherever he went. I think
[1:24:24] that's like each one of us.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; No matter where you go,
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; you better take something with you that
[1:24:30] you can get warmed up by and start a
[1:24:32] fire.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; In every church, there should be a
[1:24:38] keeper of the flame.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Lest the glory of God
[1:24:46] Huh?
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; That the light of Israel should be
[1:24:49] snuffed out.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; The fire had started something inside of
[1:24:59] him. And the same substance that was
[1:25:00] burning within God was now that
[1:25:04] flammable mixture that was laying within
[1:25:07] Jeremiah. And he said, "I've got a fire
[1:25:09] shut up in my bone.
[1:25:13] I want all of you to know that I since a
[1:25:16] young man at 18 years of age.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; I've been deeply affected.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just hearing a tape,
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; but it was hearing something beyond that
[1:25:40] voice.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:43] something that ignited
[1:25:45] inside OF ME THAT I COULD NOT QUENCH IT.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; OH, I TRIED TO RUN from it.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; I didn't understand it,
[1:25:59] but there was something that affected
[1:26:00] me.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; And may I say this to all of you, it
[1:26:06] still affects me.
[1:26:12] In the sermon perseverant, brother Bram
[1:26:14] said Moses had come in the presence of
[1:26:16] God heard his voice. A miracle sign. He
[1:26:19] knowed he was a consuming fire. And here
[1:26:22] he is in the pillar of fire back in a
[1:26:24] bush. All of his education, all theology
[1:26:27] left him. And he knowed one thing. There
[1:26:30] was a God. And he had his orders. And a
[1:26:33] crooked stick was good enough. He'd been
[1:26:36] in the presence of God. Don't even make
[1:26:38] any difference how many trained men in
[1:26:40] Egypt had
[1:26:42] any of the things didn't mean a thing to
[1:26:45] Moses. He had been in the presence of
[1:26:48] God and he was persevering. He's going
[1:26:50] down to take over against shields and
[1:26:53] trained men by the tens of thousands
[1:26:55] with a crooked stick IN HIS HAND. STOP
[1:26:58] him if you can.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; There's nothing can stop him.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; He did it. He went down and took over
[1:27:06] because he [snorts] was perseverant when
[1:27:08] he absolutely knowed he would been in
[1:27:11] the presence of God. He had heard the
[1:27:13] voice OF GOD OUT OF THE presence of God.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not only the voice was, but it was
[1:27:20] a scriptural voice.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; THERE'S ALL KINDS OF VOICES. CHECK it
[1:27:26] with the word.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; The voice said, "I am the God of
[1:27:29] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I made a
[1:27:33] promise I would deliver these people.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; The time is at hand.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; I've heard their groanings. I I've seen
[1:27:41] their task masters burdening them. And I
[1:27:45] remember my promise. I am come down to
[1:27:49] deliver them
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; AND I'M SENDING YOU
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; to do it.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; That's good enough. He seen his glory
[1:27:56] and away he went.
[1:27:59] The fire was now ignited inside of
[1:28:01] Moses.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; It was burning all of the education, all
[1:28:05] of the complexes,
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; all of the religious things that he had
[1:28:11] learned and all the ways of war and all
[1:28:15] the things he had learned in the house
[1:28:17] of Pharaoh.
[1:28:19] Now God took him
[1:28:22] because the 40 years under Pharaoh had
[1:28:24] to be unlearned in 40 years in the
[1:28:27] backside of the desert. Understand this.
[1:28:30] For every year of wrong teaching,
[1:28:34] everything that you learned as a
[1:28:35] Catholic or
[1:28:37] whatever religion that you were being
[1:28:41] raised up, it'll take that many years of
[1:28:44] correct teaching just to bring you to
[1:28:46] balance.
[1:28:48] And then you start learning because be
[1:28:53] up until then all the years that you had
[1:28:55] learned you have to unlearn.
[1:28:58] Wow.
[1:29:00] Some of you got a long ways to go.
[1:29:03] Others of you listen I I thank God I
[1:29:05] wasn't and I I say this humbly.
[1:29:08] I wished I would have had believing
[1:29:11] parents. I wished I would have had
[1:29:13] parents that were Christian but they
[1:29:15] were not.
[1:29:17] wasn't raised in church.
[1:29:20] We didn't read the Bible.
[1:29:24] I asked my father one time, "Why don't
[1:29:26] we go to church?" Ah,
[1:29:29] church. That's for losers. That's for
[1:29:31] weak people. Look at them. He said, "Do
[1:29:33] any of them look happy when they go into
[1:29:35] church?" And I have to be honest.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Look at the people walking in. Most of
[1:29:41] them got their butt.
[1:29:45] Huh?
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on, man.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Get happy.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; You're never going to WIN SOMEBODY WITH
[1:29:53] A FROWN.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; GET HAPPY ABOUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE. THANK
[1:29:56] GOD FOR WHAT WE'VE GOT. THIS MESSAGE IS
[1:29:59] THE GREATEST THING.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE ASHAMED OF IT. TELL SOMEBODY.
[1:30:04] YES,
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; SIR.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; GOD SENT A PROPHET
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; VINDICATED of God.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; SIGNS FOLLOWING.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:17] Hebrews 1:7. And the angel he saith who
[1:30:21] maketh his angel spirits
[1:30:24] and his ministers
[1:30:27] a flame of fire.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; As I told the visitor that Amos brought
[1:30:36] to church the other day, I said, "We're
[1:30:38] dangerous people.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; We start fires." Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; You get around us,
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; it may rub off on you because if you're
[1:30:50] combustible,
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; there might be a spark because you know
[1:30:54] what? I believe that we ought to be on
[1:30:57] fire for God.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Sometimes fires pop.
[1:31:02] Little spark, huh? Sit down next to a
[1:31:05] believer and he's just excited.
[1:31:06] Hallelujah. MAN, YOU KNOW WHAT GOD DID
[1:31:08] FOR ME THE OTHER DAY? OH, YEAH.
[1:31:12] MAN,
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; what's the matter with you? You a
[1:31:15] fanatic or something? Yeah, I am.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; I don't mind admitting IT. I AM A
[1:31:21] FANATIC. I SERVE GOD IN THE WAY THAT
[1:31:23] MOST MEN CALL HERESY.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Don't get too excited.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; You know, settle down.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Relax.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; We're in church. Uh-huh.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Don't get too excited. Well, I'll tell
[1:31:40] you what. If a spark fell on you right
[1:31:42] now,
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; huh? You ever sat around a a campfire
[1:31:45] and all OF A SUDDEN POP POP LIKE THAT
[1:31:47] AND TWO or three SPARKS FALL ON
[1:31:49] SOMEBODY? YEAH. YEAH, MAN.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; That's hot.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; It'll make you move. That's true.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; The fire was purging
[1:32:05] Moses from everything that he had
[1:32:07] learned formerly.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; When God spoke to Saul on the road to
[1:32:13] Damascus,
[1:32:14] he saw a pillar of fire.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Now remember I told you wherever you see
[1:32:19] the pillar of fire, watch for his voice.
[1:32:24] He said, "Lord, Lord, here is a Jew."
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; A Pharisee of Pharisees
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; concerning the law blameless.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Elohim, who art thou?" He
[1:32:38] said, "I'm Jesus, whom thou persecuted?"
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that all of a
[1:32:43] sudden, God had to take his eyes and
[1:32:45] blind him to open his spiritual eyes.
[1:32:50] Sometimes God has got to take you and
[1:32:54] turn you upside down
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; from everything you knew and what you
[1:32:58] BELIEVE TO SOMETHING SO DIFFERENT.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE NOT WALKING
[1:33:03] BY SIGHT ANYMORE. YOU'RE WALKING BY
[1:33:05] FAITH.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; AND CALLING THOSE THINGS that are not as
[1:33:10] though they were.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT the power of positive
[1:33:13] thinking.
[1:33:15] This is power in believing the word is
[1:33:18] greater than the symptoms you're going
[1:33:20] through.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; God spoke to Paul from the midst of the
[1:33:28] fire. The voice was revealing
[1:33:32] something to Paul.
[1:33:34] All of his theology now became dunk
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; that HE MIGHT KNOW CHRIST AND him
[1:33:41] crucified.
[1:33:44] It was a voice that spoke out of the
[1:33:46] midst of the fire. His soul caught fire
[1:33:49] that day. And guess what? He now became
[1:33:54] so zealous for God. The things that he
[1:33:56] once hated, now he loves.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Fiery sermon proceeded out of his mouth
[1:34:02] and he caught places on fire everywhere
[1:34:06] he preached. GOD, GIVE US MINISTERS THAT
[1:34:09] DON'T GIVE US SOME flowery sermon about
[1:34:11] God's love and he loves everybody AND
[1:34:13] EVERYTHING. GOD, GIVE US MINISTERS
[1:34:16] THAT'LL STAND BEHIND THIS SACRED DESK
[1:34:18] THAT'LL PREACH WITH FIRE AND TREMBLING,
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; A CLEANSING AND A PURGING FIRE.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; God spoke
[1:34:33] to the disciples on the day of Pentecost
[1:34:36] and fire fell on each one.
[1:34:41] When a messenger comes on the scene,
[1:34:47] his words will cause souls to catch fire
[1:34:50] everywhere he speaks.
[1:34:52] Revelations 4:E 5 says, "And out of the
[1:34:55] throne proceeded lightnings
[1:34:58] and thunderings
[1:35:00] and voices,
[1:35:02] and there were seven lamps of fire
[1:35:04] burning before the throne, which were
[1:35:07] the seven spirits of God."
[1:35:10] SO WHEREVER YOU FIND the pillar of fire,
[1:35:13] you better be listening because there's
[1:35:15] a voice coming out of that fire.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; We know the Bible says in Malachi 3:6
[1:35:22] THAT I THE LORD GOD CHANGE NOT.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; People change, FASHIONS CHANGE,
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; TIMES CHANGE, GOVERNMENTS CHANGE,
[1:35:31] churches change, but God does not
[1:35:34] change. Amen.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:8 said Jesus Christ is the
[1:35:40] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; He doesn't change.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; If God is the same as he's always been,
[1:35:52] then we know he's constant.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; He's an absolute.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; What he hated back then, he'll hate now.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; What he loved then, he will love now.
[1:36:03] Numbers 11:es 1-3. And when the people
[1:36:07] complained and it displeased the Lord
[1:36:09] because I want to show you that the
[1:36:11] voice that speaks from the fire
[1:36:14] sometimes represents judgment and
[1:36:16] displeasure.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; And when the people complained and it
[1:36:19] displeased the Lord and the Lord heard
[1:36:21] it and his anger was kindled and the
[1:36:24] fire of the Lord burnt AMONG THEM AND
[1:36:26] CONSUMED THEM, they were in the
[1:36:28] uttermost parts of the camp. kind of
[1:36:30] like the uttermost people within the
[1:36:32] message
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; that never come all the way in.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; They just stay on the uttermost.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; They like to sit on the back row.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; They want to sit near the door.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Some of you have never sat up front.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Get close.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; What are you afraid of?
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:00] Yeah.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; God forbid you catch on fire.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, BROTHER.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; LAY DOWN AND ROLL.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; YEAH. COME ON.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; MAN,
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; somebody needs this this morning.
[1:37:27] A lot of times you've been under some
[1:37:29] lukewarm condition
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; trying to get warm by painted fire
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; and you got that plastic
[1:37:38] smile.
[1:37:40] God is so good.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Don't you just love him? I'm so happy
[1:37:45] I'm here today.
[1:37:48] Let's all sing When We All Get to
[1:37:50] Heaven.
[1:37:52] Sh
[1:37:54] wind.
[1:37:57] I want something real.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; You know, WHEN SOMEBODY SINGS FROM THEIR
[1:38:02] HEART, DO YOU KNOW most songs
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; that really have an effect were were
[1:38:08] birthed
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; under A BAPTISM OF FIRE OF FIERY TRIALS.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; That song that Justin sang this morning
[1:38:22] is one of my favorite songs.
[1:38:31] I want to know when believing isn't
[1:38:36] easy.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE MOUNTAIN TOPS JUST A MEMORY,
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; it's just long ago. I
[1:38:47] I've been through the trial.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Why is it I can't seem to climb above
[1:38:52] this?
[1:38:57] Oh, but the day will come you just hang
[1:38:58] on because you know what?
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Faith will become your victory.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; In fact, I was up in the Cloverdale area
[1:39:12] here just
[1:39:14] a few months ago and brother Dalton Harp
[1:39:16] who wrote that song.
[1:39:19] We were just sitting around with a bunch
[1:39:21] of couples and young kids and everything
[1:39:24] and I said, "Uh, Brother Dalton, you are
[1:39:26] here and you're one of my most favorite
[1:39:28] singers." And I said, "Would you would
[1:39:31] you sing us a song?"
[1:39:33] And he said, "You know," he said, "I
[1:39:35] made a promise to God years ago that
[1:39:37] whenever anybody asked me to sing, I
[1:39:40] would sing for his glory." He got up and
[1:39:42] he sang that song,
[1:39:44] "When believing ain't easy."
[1:39:47] and his wife was going through a trial
[1:39:50] and she was
[1:39:52] she was sick unto death.
[1:39:56] And so this song was birthed out of the
[1:39:59] trial. I'm losing my wife. She's 20 some
[1:40:02] odd years of age and I got several kids
[1:40:06] and I'm losing her.
[1:40:09] When believing
[1:40:12] isn't easy.
[1:40:15] when the mountain top and
[1:40:17] see is it's not hard to believe when
[1:40:20] skies are blue,
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; money in the bank and
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; your health is good and everything is
[1:40:27] going right.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; But what about when all of a sudden all
[1:40:31] hell breaks loose around you
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; and you're getting tested?
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Do you really BELIEVE THAT? WHY? WELL,
[1:40:40] IF GOD REALLY LOVED YOU, WHY WOULD HE
[1:40:43] let you go through this?
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe he don't love me. Maybe he hasn't
[1:40:48] heard my prayers. Oh, I I guess I guess
[1:40:51] I'm just not one of them.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; No. Let me tell you, God does it for a
[1:40:57] purpose. THERE'S NOTHING BUT WHAT YOU GO
[1:40:59] THROUGH, BUT GOD HAS GOT A PURPOSE IN
[1:41:01] IT. IF YOU'LL QUIT LOOKING AT THE
[1:41:04] PROBLEM AND LOOK AT THE PROMISE,
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; I WILL BE WITH YOU. ALL THINGS WILL WORK
[1:41:10] TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD. I'M NOT SEEING
[1:41:12] THE GOOD. THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING
[1:41:14] AT THE PROBLEM.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD GETS DONE WITH ME,
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; I SHALL COME FORTH
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; AS PURE GOLD.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Tried in a refiner's fire.
[1:41:29] [snorts]
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:37] In numbers 11 verse 1-3 and the people
[1:41:41] complained, anger was kindled and fire
[1:41:44] of the Lord burnt among them and
[1:41:45] consumed them.
[1:41:48] And the people cried unto Moses. When
[1:41:50] Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire was
[1:41:52] quenched.
[1:41:53] And he called the name of the place
[1:41:56] Taborra because the fire of the Lord
[1:41:58] burnt among them. Either get happy or
[1:42:02] get consumed because of your complaint.
[1:42:10] Leviticus 10 1-3 through 1 through 2.
[1:42:16] And Nab
[1:42:18] and Abaiu,
[1:42:20] the sons of Aaron, the high priest,
[1:42:23] the sons of Aaron, took either of them
[1:42:27] his sensor, and put fire therein, and
[1:42:30] put incense thereon, AND OFFERED STRANGE
[1:42:33] FIRE BEFORE the Lord.
[1:42:36] which he commanded them not. And there
[1:42:39] went out fire from the Lord and devoured
[1:42:41] them and they died before the Lord.
[1:42:44] Yeah.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think these doctrines that
[1:42:47] are being conjured up among the ministry
[1:42:49] today
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; that THEY ARE SAYING IS THE FIRE of God,
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; I think it could be labeled strange fire
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF THE PROPHET DIDN'T SAY IT, if
[1:43:00] he didn't point to it, IF HE DIDN'T SHOW
[1:43:03] YOU THE THE RESULTS OF A REAL REVIVAL OF
[1:43:06] GOD AND THEN YOU GOT TO WORK SOMETHING
[1:43:08] UP, I THINK YOU GOT STRANGE FIRE IN YOUR
[1:43:11] SENSOR.
[1:43:16] I heard a brother preach the other day
[1:43:18] and he said, "I'm afraid today we got
[1:43:21] all this substance abuse and we got
[1:43:23] people that got all kinds of problems
[1:43:26] and today we have
[1:43:29] addicts that just want relief from their
[1:43:31] addiction."
[1:43:33] And he SAID, "SO WE HAVE MESSAGE
[1:43:34] METHADONE.
[1:43:39] We just go ahead and have a prayer line.
[1:43:42] It don't matter the life they're living.
[1:43:43] THEY'RE NOT PREACHING AGAINST THE LIFE
[1:43:46] that they're living. You just come up
[1:43:47] here. I'll tell you what, I'll pray over
[1:43:48] that devil. I'll cast him out. Yahoo.
[1:43:51] [screaming]
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; And so they have message methodone. Come
[1:43:57] up here and get a little fix and kind of
[1:44:00] a little hypo for the moment and for the
[1:44:02] next two weeks. Yeah. Yeah. and you
[1:44:06] become addicted on the next
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; time for a prayer line
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; because
[1:44:19] that's the only way they can get relief.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you the best way to get
[1:44:24] relief is repent.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; God, help us in these meetings
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; to tell people repent. Amen.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Repent with a conviction.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Repent enough to get you to
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; give back the tools you stole from your
[1:44:47] boss five years ago.
[1:44:54] I had a surfboard given to me
[1:45:01] by a brother who stole it from the
[1:45:03] company I worked for.
[1:45:06] And it was a nice surfboard,
[1:45:09] I tell you. Had a rainbow and three
[1:45:12] moons on it. And this this this was a
[1:45:14] hot little board. I love that thing. And
[1:45:18] I kept it and I knew it was stolen. And
[1:45:21] never told the boss and I kind of put it
[1:45:25] away and said, "Well, you know what?
[1:45:26] Look, he's got lots of money. Look at
[1:45:28] that." And so anyway, I I get converted
[1:45:33] years later.
[1:45:35] And I hear brother Ram say
[1:45:40] you make right those things that and I
[1:45:42] thought throughout my whole life I
[1:45:44] thought what is there anything I've done
[1:45:46] that I take some something from somebody
[1:45:49] I didn't make it right his name was Don
[1:45:52] Hansen of Hansen Surfboards you know
[1:45:55] what I did I wrote him a letter I said
[1:45:58] hey Don
[1:46:00] I'm sorry I want you to know
[1:46:03] they had a surfboard that was stolen
[1:46:05] from your surfboard shop and was given
[1:46:08] to me. And I knew it was stolen. And
[1:46:11] because I didn't steal it, I allowed him
[1:46:14] to give it to me. I justified it. And I
[1:46:17] want you to know, Don, I am sorry. And
[1:46:19] the surfboard was sold for $75. And I'm
[1:46:22] sending you the $75. And I say, "I'm
[1:46:24] sorry. You forgive me."
[1:46:27] I thought, "Man, I'm going to get me a
[1:46:28] blistering letter and he's going to tell
[1:46:30] me you this and that and don't you ever
[1:46:33] come." No. You know what he did? He
[1:46:36] said, "Thank you."
[1:46:39] He says, "Thank you."
[1:46:42] That you had the stamina and the guts to
[1:46:45] make what? Make something right.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it is hard.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Very hard.
[1:46:54] I want the Holy Ghost to move within our
[1:46:57] lives enough
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; that'll cause you to go back to things
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; that you justified and you've been
[1:47:04] trying to get over and you can't. You
[1:47:06] know what? Go make it right.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; You know what he said at the end of the
[1:47:10] letter? If you ever want a job, you are
[1:47:12] more than welcome to return.
[1:47:19] God, give us
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; real Holy Ghost conviction
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; that when we repent,
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; WE MAKE THINGS RIGHT. WE DON'T JUST
[1:47:26] DON'T SAY IT,
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; but we manifest it in our lives,
[1:47:33] [snorts]
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 22 19 and 22. Therefore, thus
[1:47:44] sayith the Lord God,
[1:47:47] because you are all become dross,
[1:47:50] behold, therefore, I will gather you
[1:47:52] into the midst of Jerusalem. And as they
[1:47:55] gather silver and brass and iron and
[1:47:58] lead and tin into the midst of the
[1:48:00] furnace to blow fire upon it to melt it,
[1:48:04] so I will gather you in my anger and in
[1:48:06] my fury. I will leave you there and melt
[1:48:11] you.
[1:48:13] Yay, I will gather you and blow upon you
[1:48:15] in the fire of my wrath. And ye shall be
[1:48:19] melted in the midst thereof. And as
[1:48:21] silver is melted in the midst of the
[1:48:23] furnace, so shall ye be melted in the
[1:48:25] midst thereof. And he shall know that I,
[1:48:27] the Lord God, have poured out my fury
[1:48:29] upon you.
[1:48:31] Dross. Do we have any dross?
[1:48:36] Any wasteful material in our lives that
[1:48:38] God says you don't need it?
[1:48:41] I looked up the word dross. It means a
[1:48:43] waste product of impurity formed on the
[1:48:46] surface of molten metal. The unusable
[1:48:50] portion left over when making metals.
[1:48:54] Well, what if God is purging you and
[1:48:57] he's melting you and you've got this
[1:48:59] dross in your life?
[1:49:04] God, help us get the dross out.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:10] There's nothing like the refiner's fire.
[1:49:17] There are sometimes in our lives dross
[1:49:19] that comes up that is impurities
[1:49:22] that needs to be purged.
[1:49:24] And the best thing that God can do for
[1:49:26] your life is to purge it with fire.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:31] Proverbs 17 and3 the finding post is for
[1:49:36] silver and the furnace for gold and the
[1:49:39] Lord tryth the hearts. I want you to ask
[1:49:42] yourself right here. Judge yourself
[1:49:44] right now. Lord, do I have any draws
[1:49:46] within my life?
[1:49:49] Is there anything in my life that is
[1:49:51] holding me back? Is there any
[1:49:53] impurities?
[1:49:55] Are there any doors within my home
[1:49:59] that I've kept locked? And you're not
[1:50:01] allowed to go behind.
[1:50:08] Isaiah 48:10, "Behold, I have refined
[1:50:10] thee, but not with silver. I have chosen
[1:50:13] thee in the furnace
[1:50:15] of affliction."
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Do you know that some of you go through
[1:50:19] afflictions that are self imposed?
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; You cause it yourself.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:27] I'm going through such a hard time.
[1:50:31] I wanted that big house. I wanted a new
[1:50:33] car. I wanted that new job. I wanted TO
[1:50:36] BE THE BOSS OF THE JOB. And next thing
[1:50:38] you know, man, I tell you what, you got
[1:50:41] a wild cat by the tail AND YOU'RE
[1:50:43] WONDERING, "HOW DO I GET RID OF THIS
[1:50:44] THING?
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Give me some relief because
[1:50:51] I'm going crazy."
[1:50:55] Just about the time that you get ahead
[1:50:58] of the rat race, along comes a faster
[1:51:00] rat.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; It's true, man.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Just about the time you got things kind
[1:51:08] of controlled, here comes something
[1:51:10] bigger, faster.
[1:51:14] 1 Peter 1:7 that the trial of your faith
[1:51:17] being much more precious than of gold
[1:51:19] that perisheth
[1:51:21] though it be tried with fire
[1:51:24] might be found in the praise and honor
[1:51:26] and glory the appearing of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:29] Watch this. Now, brother Brown said in
[1:51:31] watching his star 1959,
[1:51:34] may I say tonight
[1:51:36] that God has a sign today.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; It's a sign of his spirit.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; That where Jesus is, there's life for he
[1:51:45] is life.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Where Jesus is, there's gospel life for
[1:51:49] his light. Where Jesus is,
[1:51:53] there is fire. Amen.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; For he is a consuming fire that burn up
[1:51:58] all your unbelief and your draws.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 4:es 12-13. Beloved, think not
[1:52:08] strange
[1:52:10] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[1:52:12] try you
[1:52:14] as though some strange thing happened to
[1:52:16] you.
[1:52:18] But rejoice in as much that you are
[1:52:19] partakers of Christ's sufferings,
[1:52:22] that when his glory shall be revealed,
[1:52:25] you may be glad also with exceeding joy.
[1:52:29] Also, fire means not only judgment and
[1:52:32] displeasure, but it also means
[1:52:34] acceptance and approval.
[1:52:39] Was it not there in first kings with
[1:52:42] Elijah on Mount Carmel?
[1:52:46] The Lord
[1:52:50] spoke through Elijah to the people, I
[1:52:52] and I only remain a prophet of the Lord.
[1:52:55] Pretty bold statement.
[1:52:59] I and I alone remain a prophet of the
[1:53:01] Lord.
[1:53:04] And there are 450 men.
[1:53:08] Let them themselves give two bullets.
[1:53:10] Let them choose one bullet. And it goes
[1:53:11] on and on. let you call on the name of
[1:53:14] your gods, and I will call on the name
[1:53:17] of the Lord God, and the God thatth by
[1:53:19] fire,
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; let him be God. And the people said,
[1:53:24] it's well spoken.
[1:53:26] So there in verse 37, hear me, oh Lord.
[1:53:30] Hear me that these PEOPLE MAY KNOW THAT
[1:53:32] THOU ART THE LORD GOD, that thou has
[1:53:35] turned their heart back again. Look at
[1:53:37] it. Here's that spirit of Elijah
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; turning hearts back again. How's he
[1:53:41] doing it?
[1:53:43] And then the fire of the Lord fell and
[1:53:45] consumed the burnt sacrifice.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; The wood, the stones, the dust licked up
[1:53:50] the water and the people said, "The
[1:53:54] Lord, he is God." Was
[1:54:00] it not there in Judges chapter 6 where
[1:54:03] Gideon was there before the Lord and he
[1:54:06] said in Judges 6:1 17 he said unto them
[1:54:10] if now I have found grace in thy sight
[1:54:13] then show me a sign that thou talkest
[1:54:16] with me. Show me a sign. I want to know
[1:54:19] it's you talking.
[1:54:22] Depart not then I pray thee, and till I
[1:54:26] come unto thee, and bring forth, and he
[1:54:27] goes on and on. Verse 21, the angel of
[1:54:30] the Lord put forth the end of the staff
[1:54:31] that was in his hand, touched the flesh,
[1:54:34] the unleavened cakes, and there rose a
[1:54:36] fire out of the rock,
[1:54:38] consumed the flesh and the unleavened
[1:54:40] cakes. Then the angel of the Lord
[1:54:43] departed out of his sight. And when
[1:54:44] Gideon perceived that he was an angel of
[1:54:47] the Lord,
[1:54:49] Gideon said, "Alas, oh Lord God, for
[1:54:52] because I have seen an angel
[1:54:56] of the Lord face to face."
[1:55:00] I want all of you to understand, me,
[1:55:01] too, musicians, if you come because I
[1:55:03] know I'm not going to finish this.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; How many of you can say, "I've seen an
[1:55:12] angel of the Lord."
[1:55:14] face to face.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; I've heard him preach and when he
[1:55:18] preached his sermons, they were sermons
[1:55:20] of fire.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; They affected me.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, if you listen to
[1:55:27] tapes and you turn it on and you just
[1:55:29] hear and don't obey,
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; it'll do you no good. Amen.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Turning on a tape without asking God to
[1:55:39] give you wisdom and understanding is no
[1:55:42] DIFFERENT THAN A CATHOLIC burning a
[1:55:45] candle
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; and saying a prayer.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Don't let the prophet do your religion
[1:55:53] for you.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Okay, prophet, preach.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Preach to me now. Turn on. Press play.
[1:56:03] Go to sleep.
[1:56:05] Wait a little bit later. Okay, I'm done.
[1:56:07] I I don't I don't have any more time.
[1:56:08] Okay, turn it off. I'll wait till I have
[1:56:11] more time. Then I'll turn you back on.
[1:56:14] You see what I'm saying?
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:56:25] And I want I want to bring this down.
[1:56:29] I want to bring this down to today
[1:56:39] [snorts]
[1:56:41] because David had an answer by fire.
[1:56:44] Solomon had an answer by fire. We see
[1:56:47] that in the scriptures.
[1:56:51] And so 1909 and April the 6, there was a
[1:56:55] pillar of fire. Listen young people,
[1:56:58] this is not a story.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; This happened.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; There was a pillar of fire that came
[1:57:04] through a window at the birth of a
[1:57:06] little boy
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; in a little log cabin in Burksville,
[1:57:10] Kentucky.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; 1916,
[1:57:15] the voice speaks as a commission. Don't
[1:57:17] drink, smoke, or defile your body in any
[1:57:20] way. For when you get older, I have a
[1:57:21] work for you to do.
[1:57:26] 1933 in June, Pillar of Fire appears on
[1:57:31] the Ohio River and speaks as John the
[1:57:35] Baptist was sent to forrun his first
[1:57:36] coming. You and your [music] message is
[1:57:39] sent to forrun his second coming.
[1:57:42] May the 7th, 1946.
[1:57:47] He says, "The very day, the very hour in
[1:57:51] which Israel became a nation,
[1:57:54] God met me down
[1:57:57] there in the cave in Greensmill
[1:58:02] and sent me out with this commission."
[1:58:05] He said, "Watch and be spiritual. You'll
[1:58:07] catch this. They're the two of them are
[1:58:09] connected together." Why? Because as the
[1:58:12] Gentile dispensation is closing, there's
[1:58:16] another one opening up with the Jews.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; January 24th, 1950,
[1:58:27] the pillar of fires taken above the head
[1:58:29] of the prophet.
[1:58:33] This wasn't a message believer that took
[1:58:35] the photos. In fact, it was a
[1:58:37] professional photographer hired to take
[1:58:40] photos to go against Brother Brenham.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; And all the photos, snap, fast forward,
[1:58:46] snap forward, snap, snap. All the
[1:58:49] photos. There was only one photo.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; And the whole roll of film that showed
[1:58:54] up. What was God doing? Giving a sign.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; This is my prophet. Hear ye him.
[1:59:06] January the 8th, 1961,
[1:59:09] the pillar of fire draws on the wall of
[1:59:12] Brandham Tabernacle. He's preaching from
[1:59:14] Revelation chapter 4, the throne of
[1:59:17] mercy and of judgment,
[1:59:19] confirming the seven church ages or the
[1:59:22] seven lamps were burning
[1:59:25] with the fire and flames of God.
[1:59:29] In December of 1962, he has a vision of
[1:59:32] seven angels,
[1:59:35] constellation, he said, coming from
[1:59:37] eternity
[1:59:39] faster than a blink of an eye.
[1:59:44] In January of 63 in Sabino Canyon,
[1:59:49] a sword appears in his hand.
[1:59:52] Then I'm reminded of Isaiah 66:es
[1:59:56] 15 and 16. And behold, the Lord will
[1:59:59] come with fire,
[2:00:02] and with his chariots, like as a
[2:00:03] whirlwind, to render his anger with
[2:00:06] fury, and his rebuke with flames of
[2:00:08] fire, and by fire, and by his sword will
[2:00:11] the Lord
[2:00:12] plead with all flesh. And the slain of
[2:00:15] the Lord shall be many. The fiery sword
[2:00:18] of the spirit was now placed in the
[2:00:20] hands of the prophet. Amen.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; In February of 1963
[2:00:27] in a place called Sunset Mountain.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; My God. My God.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; You understand what God was doing?
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; 63 Sunset Mountain February.
[2:00:50] pillar of fire descends
[2:00:52] and a prophet of God is caught up into a
[2:00:55] constellation of seven mighty angels.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; For thus saith the Lord, GO BACK TO
[2:01:04] JEFFERSONVILLE, for there I will give to
[2:01:06] you the revelation of the seven seals,
[2:01:09] not six,
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; seven.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. So March the 17th through
[2:01:16] the 24th, 1963,
[2:01:20] Brother Bram starts with God in
[2:01:21] simplicity in the breach.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; And there he begins to open,
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; the sealed book.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; God begins to now
[2:01:36] purge this message with fire.
[2:01:40] take away all his former learning, all
[2:01:42] of the things that he had learned from
[2:01:44] Clarence Larkin and dispensational
[2:01:46] truths and now God purging this message
[2:01:49] with fire.
[2:01:54] So I
[2:01:56] I had a brethren, you brethren, just
[2:01:58] keep playing. It's okay. It calms the
[2:02:01] sheep. They they know they're going to
[2:02:03] be led out here pretty soon. They know
[2:02:05] they have a meal coming.
[2:02:08] I had brother DDA call him by call me
[2:02:11] the other day. In fact, several of Tim
[2:02:14] Hoffer's family called him and called
[2:02:16] him and said, "Brother Ron, would he
[2:02:18] does he have somewhere that he's ever
[2:02:20] told about that dream of being at the
[2:02:23] wedding supper?" I said, "Yeah, I've
[2:02:26] told it several times, but I don't even
[2:02:28] remember what sermon I I relayed the
[2:02:31] dream in what sermon. Can I take a few
[2:02:35] moments and share with you a dream I
[2:02:37] had?
[2:02:41] Sandy, I was about in my late 20s. You
[2:02:44] just come to the message. I wasn't very
[2:02:45] old. Didn't know a whole lot.
[2:02:49] [snorts] Excuse me.
[2:02:52] Now, when I tell a dream,
[2:02:55] [snorts] a dream is very, very personal.
[2:03:01] Does it make me anything special? just
[2:03:04] said, "God gave me this dream." And I
[2:03:05] dreamed and we were at the wedding
[2:03:07] supper.
[2:03:10] There was a table,
[2:03:12] Brother Brennham said, miles and miles
[2:03:14] long on each side. And we were all in
[2:03:18] white robes.
[2:03:20] And we had just gotten done with the
[2:03:23] supper, and supper was was ended, and
[2:03:28] we were all fellowshipping. And guess
[2:03:29] what? We were sitting across from the
[2:03:32] people in our age and the people we knew
[2:03:34] and we're all together and we were just
[2:03:36] rejoicing. My we have made it and we are
[2:03:39] here and the wedding supper and came
[2:03:42] time for the rewards
[2:03:45] [snorts]
[2:03:48] and one by one they began to say well
[2:03:52] brother so and so will you come forward
[2:03:54] for your reward?
[2:03:58] Now there was remember now you're in
[2:04:00] you're in eternity now time means
[2:04:02] nothing however long it takes and if
[2:04:05] there's a list from A to Z it doesn't
[2:04:07] matter
[2:04:09] you're just taking the time and here
[2:04:11] from the least to the greatest they
[2:04:13] begin to call each one forward
[2:04:16] will brother John or brother so and so
[2:04:18] will they come forward and each time a
[2:04:20] name is called whether it be a brother
[2:04:21] or sister
[2:04:23] you said oh God
[2:04:26] grant to them a great reward reward. Oh,
[2:04:28] I I know them. They Lord, THEY WENT
[2:04:30] THROUGH SO MUCH. GOD, just reward them
[2:04:34] abundantly and they went forward before
[2:04:36] the Lord in the throne.
[2:04:40] He placed a crown upon their head and
[2:04:44] they went back and sat down.
[2:04:48] And I remember that one by one, it just
[2:04:50] seemed to get greater, the intensity of
[2:04:53] the reward. and those that had served
[2:04:56] God. It seemed like the rewards were
[2:04:58] getting bigger. And I remember they
[2:05:00] called my name.
[2:05:03] I went forward.
[2:05:06] I went before the the Lord and he put a
[2:05:08] crown on my head.
[2:05:16] I felt the weight of the crown.
[2:05:19] It fit perfectly.
[2:05:22] I felt the velvet on the inside where it
[2:05:24] was placed on my head and I thought it
[2:05:27] fit so perfectly. How did he know my hat
[2:05:30] size?
[2:05:32] My hat size. He's God.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; And so they placed the crown on my head
[2:05:39] and I I was thankful and I went and I
[2:05:42] sat back down and from one by one we all
[2:05:46] went forward and we got our crowns. And
[2:05:48] then it came time for the messenger of
[2:05:50] this age. And we all thought, "Oh, oh,
[2:05:53] God.
[2:05:56] If there ever was a one
[2:05:59] that's worthy of a great crown and a
[2:06:02] great reward,
[2:06:04] it's William Brandham."
[2:06:08] And we're all thinking, "Oh." And so
[2:06:10] they called his name, William Marian
[2:06:13] Brham.
[2:06:17] We all looked around and nobody moved.
[2:06:21] He's not walking forward
[2:06:25] again. William, Mary, and Brandon.
[2:06:29] And we're all, "Oh, God,
[2:06:32] what a reward."
[2:06:35] And he wasn't going forward. AND THERE
[2:06:39] WAS THE PEOPLE ACROSS from me that were
[2:06:40] sitting, David, that were looking behind
[2:06:42] me. [snorts] And so I turned to look and
[2:06:45] there he was walking away
[2:06:48] and the white robe of his crown or
[2:06:51] [snorts] excuse me the white robe that
[2:06:54] he was wearing
[2:06:57] I could see the muscles contorting in
[2:07:00] his back. They reflected that he was
[2:07:03] weeping. I could see it.
[2:07:08] And he kept walking away.
[2:07:12] And two brothers got up and one grabbed
[2:07:15] his one arm and the other and they
[2:07:16] turned him around and he had his head
[2:07:18] down
[2:07:20] and they brought him before the Lord
[2:07:22] Jesus
[2:07:24] and he said, "I'm not worthy."
[2:07:27] Now I told Billy, Paul and Joseph this
[2:07:30] dream.
[2:07:31] Billy Paul started weeping.
[2:07:35] He said, "Ron, you saw my daddy."
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:42] He said, "You saw my daddy." He said,
[2:07:44] "That's the way he was."
[2:07:49] He had his head down.
[2:07:51] He said, "I'm not worthy. I'm not
[2:07:54] worthy, Lord." And a [snorts] crown was
[2:07:56] placed on his head. And immediately, he
[2:07:58] didn't let it sit there. He took it off
[2:08:02] and he placed it at his feet.
[2:08:06] You know what I thought? Why didn't I do
[2:08:08] that as though I deserve some crown? As
[2:08:11] though I did something.
[2:08:14] WHY DIDN'T I DO IT? WHY DIDN'T I HAVE
[2:08:16] THE CHARACTER to say, "Lord, it's you."
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; And he placed the crown at his feet. And
[2:08:22] guess what we all did? We got up one by
[2:08:25] one.
[2:08:32] And we placed the crowns at his feet.
[2:08:34] And [snorts] as the crowns began to
[2:08:37] multiply around the throne, the throne
[2:08:40] had to get elevated. Why? Because it
[2:08:42] would have buried the throne. You
[2:08:45] understand? And so it it elevated until
[2:08:48] there was just thousands upon thousands
[2:08:50] of crowns.
[2:08:58] And brother Brandham said, "I'm not
[2:09:01] worthy, oh Lord, and laid his crown." We
[2:09:03] all began to think, and I thought at
[2:09:05] that time, why didn't I think of that?
[2:09:10] One day I believe that we will fulfill
[2:09:12] this vision. And probably none of us
[2:09:15] will remember
[2:09:18] that when brother Brennham lays his
[2:09:20] crown, we'll have thought, why didn't I
[2:09:22] do that? But at that time we will follow
[2:09:25] our leader and we will do as he does.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; We laid our crowns around his throne.
[2:09:33] His throne began to get elevated. Now
[2:09:35] when he was here, the Lord Jesus was
[2:09:37] here in the [music] flesh.
[2:09:40] He was the prince of peace.
[2:09:43] He was a man acquainted with grief and
[2:09:46] sorrow.
[2:09:47] He was meek and lowly.
[2:09:50] Not now.
[2:09:52] Not now. He was king.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; He was king Theophony. He was king
[2:09:58] Jesus.
[2:10:01] And he sat there as a royal
[2:10:05] a king upon his throne and it got so big
[2:10:09] until
[2:10:11] THIS THRONE GETS HIGH AND LIFTED UP. And
[2:10:15] there he was. And finally he stands up.
[2:10:18] And when he does, he looks DOWN AT ALL
[2:10:20] OF US and we're worshiping him.
[2:10:23] and the train that of his robe. He grabs
[2:10:27] it and he grabs that train
[2:10:30] and as he does he makes a big sweep like
[2:10:33] this
[2:10:35] [snorts]
[2:10:36] and when he does all of a sudden he goes
[2:10:39] into like an atomic blast.
[2:10:44] He was God. He was all omnipotent God.
[2:10:48] HE WAS ALL POWER. HE WAS ALL LIGHT. AND
[2:10:51] ALL OF US, WE LOOKED AND THE LIGHT WAS
[2:10:53] SO BRIGHT, IT DIDN'T HURT OUR EYES,
[2:10:56] but we felt his his omnipotence, his
[2:11:01] his presence. And we said, "Oh, God.
[2:11:04] [laughter]
[2:11:05] Oh, God, you're God."
[2:11:11] And then we began to sing
[2:11:15] and we begin to worship God.
[2:11:19] And I've always
[2:11:21] love to see a good singer who knows when
[2:11:23] to sing and when to start and when you
[2:11:27] know like if any of you have heard the
[2:11:29] handles Messiah
[2:11:31] and he shall reign forever and ever and
[2:11:35] ever right
[2:11:38] all of the different parts and all of
[2:11:40] and they're all doing their harmonies
[2:11:42] and I started singing now here here's
[2:11:45] something that amazed me as I was
[2:11:46] singing I knew my part
[2:11:50] I knew I didn't have to wait for Okay,
[2:11:53] give me the lead when
[2:11:57] I didn't have to wait. No, I sang it. I
[2:11:59] sang it with with with with [music]
[2:12:01] everything that was in me. I knew my
[2:12:02] part. [snorts]
[2:12:05] And the four and 20 elders fell down
[2:12:08] before his throne. And around the
[2:12:09] throne, they begin to sing and WORSHIP
[2:12:11] AND PRAISE GOD. AND I TELL YOU, ALL OF
[2:12:14] YOU THAT ARE GOING TO BE THERE, YOU KNOW
[2:12:16] YOUR PART. AND WHEN YOU SING, THERE'LL
[2:12:18] BE HARMONIES and there'll be leads AND
[2:12:21] THERE'LL BE VOICES IN THE BACKGROUND AND
[2:12:23] hallelujah and he shall reign forever
[2:12:26] and ever. Hallelujah. All that
[2:12:32] I believe
[2:12:34] that very soon
[2:12:38] we're coming to the marriage supper.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; This is going to come to pass very soon.
[2:12:48] Now,
[2:12:50] because brother DDA said, "Brother Ron,
[2:12:52] if if you'll tell this dream,"
[2:12:55] he said, "I'd like to play it for my my
[2:12:57] church." Okay, brother DDA, I've I've
[2:13:01] done this for you and for your people
[2:13:03] and for you, too.
[2:13:06] It makes me nothing big. I'm no big guy.
[2:13:12] In fact, it's almost hard for me to tell
[2:13:15] it because every time I tell it, I get
[2:13:17] broken up
[2:13:19] because I relive it.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; When I woke up that morning, there was
[2:13:24] Sandy next to me. We're just 20some
[2:13:26] years old. [panting]
[2:13:28] I said, Sandy, God gave me such a dream.
[2:13:34] Then later I told brother Billy Paul,
[2:13:36] brother Joseph, Billy Paul said,
[2:13:39] "Brother Ronnie," he texted me a little
[2:13:41] bit later and he said, "Brother Ronnie,
[2:13:43] if you don't mind, I'm going to tell
[2:13:45] this dream around the world wherever I
[2:13:47] go because what you saw was the
[2:13:50] character of my daddy."
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; So I just told you that this morning.
[2:13:58] So I I told brother DDA if I could fit
[2:14:01] it in and I knew I wasn't going to
[2:14:03] complete the sermon. So I will continue
[2:14:06] on with the God of fire
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; on the next service.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Would that be okay?
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you. I appreciate each and
[2:14:14] every one of you. I want you to know
[2:14:16] that this message
[2:14:19] is to consume you.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; It's to affect you.
[2:14:30] If it hasn't affected you,
[2:14:33] you haven't met him yet.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; You've just heard about him.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; You've heard the stories.
[2:14:41] You've just listened to all of the
[2:14:44] testimonies.
[2:14:49] Even as brother Johnny said, how many of
[2:14:51] you here have got lots of testimonies?
[2:14:55] We all do.
[2:14:58] because it is a time of testing.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; You're all going through it.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; This is the worst of all ages. And he
[2:15:08] chose the weakest
[2:15:11] of all to stand in the worst of times.
[2:15:14] Why? Because in our weakness,
[2:15:18] he's made strong.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; You love him this morning.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. 1213. I got two minutes.
[2:15:26] Let's stand together. God bless you. I
[2:15:28] love you guys.
[2:15:31] [snorts]
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; All right. What's the name of this song?

[2:19:45] Amen.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; We serve a mighty God. Amen.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Warren, would you come and close
[2:19:53] our service in a word of prayer and ask
[2:19:56] a blessing upon the food as well?
[2:20:00] So, we're going to enter the gate along
[2:20:02] the east side of the church. We will
[2:20:04] direct you to one of the four serving
[2:20:06] lines. Seniors and people with limited
[2:20:10] mobility can go straight to the front
[2:20:11] and they will be directed
[2:20:13] to the far left table. There's seating
[2:20:16] inside the gym as well as outside. So,
[2:20:18] we're going to have a baptismal right
[2:20:19] outside and then after that we can make
[2:20:21] our way to the back and directed to the
[2:20:24] survey lines for the warrant if you
[2:20:25] would.
[2:20:33] Let's bow our heads. Father, we thank
[2:20:34] you Lord for your message this morning.
[2:20:37] Truly, Father, we need the fire from
[2:20:41] your throne, Lord,
[2:20:43] that will start from our hearts. Lord
[2:20:46] Jesus, we ask you, Lord, to let this
[2:20:50] fire burn every day, Lord Jesus. We want
[2:20:53] you, Lord. We cannot live without you,
[2:20:56] Father. So, Lord Jesus, bless Brother
[2:20:58] Ron. Bless the food, Lord. And I ask you
[2:21:02] to sanctify it. And Lord, we will have a
[2:21:05] good fellowship today, Father, while we
[2:21:08] partake the food. Lord, bless your
[2:21:10] people. May your may our Lord Jesus
[2:21:14] continue to guide us and lead us in the
[2:21:17] name of Jesus [music] Christ. Amen.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if you want to be dismissed,
[2:21:22] we'll go outside for the baptismal and
[2:21:24] then afterwards we'll circle around to
[2:21:27] the gym. Amen. You are dismissed in
[2:21:29] Jesus name.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:24:02] [music]
