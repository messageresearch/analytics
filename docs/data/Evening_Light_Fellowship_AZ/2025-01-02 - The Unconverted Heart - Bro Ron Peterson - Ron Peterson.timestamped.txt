[37:48] Lord shall be made
[37:51] fat I'm doing pretty good on that one
[37:57] he that trust trusteth in his own heart
[38:02] is a
[38:04] fool but who so walketh wisely he shall
[38:08] be delivered amen don't ever trust in
[38:11] your own heart
[38:13] true we need God to help us don't we
[38:17] Acts chapter 7
[38:24] please the brothers had actually spoke
[38:27] about
[38:28] building him a house last night acts 7:
[38:33] 47-52 but Solomon built him an
[38:37] house how be it the most high dwelleth
[38:39] not in temples made with hands as saith
[38:43] the prophet Heaven is my throne and
[38:46] Earth is my foot stol what house will
[38:49] you build me sayeth the Lord or what is
[38:52] the place of my
[38:54] rest hath not my hand man made all these
[38:59] things ye stiff necked and uncircumcised
[39:02] in heart and ears you do always resist
[39:06] the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do
[39:11] ye which of the prophets have not your
[39:14] fathers
[39:16] persecuted and they have slain them and
[39:20] showed be which shed before of the
[39:24] coming of the just one of whom
[39:28] you have been now the betrayers and
[39:33] murderers amen may God add the blessing
[39:36] to the reading of his word you all may
[39:38] be seated tonight somebody say praise
[39:40] the Lord praise the Lord amen
[39:44] so like I said I'm just running a little
[39:47] bit if I was an 8 cylinder engine I've
[39:50] probably got two cylinders hitting right
[39:52] now so we'll try to get through this and
[39:54] everything but God is good amen amen and
[39:58] I'd like to talk about because we before
[40:00] we left we talked about that the healing
[40:03] the
[40:04] Brokenhearted and the subject of the
[40:06] heart is is an is actually an immense
[40:10] subject throughout
[40:11] scripture it's used well over 1300 times
[40:15] in the scriptures just talking about the
[40:18] heart and um so I want to speak tonight
[40:22] on the unconverted
[40:25] heart and I take the subject of the
[40:28] heart of the
[40:30] matter because really when we're having
[40:32] issues and if we're not serving the lord
[40:34] the heart of the matter
[40:36] is our
[40:38] heart God help it that our
[40:41] heart will be to the place that it
[40:44] should be that it wouldn't be calloused
[40:46] it wouldn't be hardened huh it wouldn't
[40:48] be
[40:49] slothful uh wouldn't be uncircumcised
[40:51] but it that it would be ready to hear
[40:54] the word of God and to do what God would
[40:57] have us to do now the Bible speaks so
[40:59] much about the heart and really today as
[41:03] I was studying there was three times
[41:05] that I woke up there at my
[41:08] desk and uh I had been studying and I
[41:11] was looking and I had been reading my
[41:13] Bible all of a
[41:15] sudden I don't know how long all of a
[41:17] sudden I wake up I don't know where I'm
[41:19] at it's like whoa and okay let's see I
[41:23] was studying on this and went back to
[41:25] study that happened three times and so
[41:28] um I didn't really have a chance to
[41:30] really uh go through it the way that I
[41:33] would like to but uh the Lord knows and
[41:35] so I have a few things here that uh the
[41:39] Lord's been dealing with me about a
[41:41] heart and uh you know there's so much
[41:44] that one could say about the heart and I
[41:46] I think saints of God we need to guard
[41:49] our
[41:50] hearts not only of the things that we uh
[41:54] we do and say around other people or the
[41:58] uh actions that we go through but also I
[42:02] believe that we should guard one
[42:03] another's heart there are times we say
[42:06] things out of either anger frustration
[42:10] some kind of human emotion where you're
[42:12] just fed up and and you say something
[42:14] and you hurt somebody has anybody ever
[42:17] experienced something like that where
[42:20] either you said it somebody else said it
[42:21] and once it's said you can't you can't
[42:23] take it
[42:24] back oh God keep us sensitive to your
[42:28] Holy Spirit guard our mouths the the
[42:31] tongue is a is an unruly member it says
[42:35] we put uh uh you know Helms on big old
[42:39] ships and make them go wherever we want
[42:41] them to go but he said no one's been
[42:44] able to to tame the
[42:46] tongue such an unruly member and what a
[42:49] great fire a small thing Kindle it and
[42:55] so God help us to watch our mouth
[42:58] to Bridle our mouths and be careful that
[43:02] we don't hurt one another and say things
[43:04] that we shouldn't in the time of
[43:06] frustration
[43:09] whatever amen the heart of man is a vast
[43:12] subject within the scriptures and as I
[43:15] had been studying it you can see there's
[43:18] so many conditions of the heart right
[43:21] and we can change our minds and we can
[43:24] change our surroundings but it will take
[43:26] an Act of God to change our heart
[43:31] amen and
[43:33] then we find out that when we speak from
[43:37] our mouth we're going to find out where
[43:40] it's coming from so turn with me if you
[43:43] would to Matthew
[43:45] 15 verses 18-
[43:48] 20 Matthew chapter
[43:52] 15 18 through 20 but those Saints which
[43:57] proceed out of the mouth come forth from
[43:59] the
[44:01] heart and they defile the
[44:04] man for out of the heart proceeds evil
[44:09] thoughts murderers
[44:12] adulteries fornications thefts false
[44:17] Witnesses and blasphemies look at this
[44:20] that come out of the mouth but where do
[44:23] they come
[44:25] from in the heart
[44:28] these are the things which defile a man
[44:32] but to eat with unwashed hands defileth
[44:35] not a man Mark
[44:39] 7 and verses 20- 23 and he said that
[44:43] which cometh out of the man that
[44:47] defileth that which cometh out of the
[44:50] man that defileth the man for from
[44:55] within out of the heart of men proceed
[44:59] evil thoughts adulteries
[45:02] fornication murderers thefts
[45:07] covetousness wickedness deceit
[45:11] lasciviousness and evil eye
[45:15] blasphemy Pride
[45:18] foolishness all these things come from
[45:21] within and defile the man I would say
[45:25] then it's a pretty good thing that we
[45:27] need to know how we uh what is coming
[45:31] forth out of our heart Lord let me hide
[45:35] Thy word in my heart that I learn not to
[45:38] sin against you because look at all of
[45:41] this stuff that comes out of the heart
[45:43] murdering envidies blasphemies
[45:46] adulteries
[45:48] fornications you see if you're not
[45:50] guarding your heart from seeds of
[45:53] Discord from seeds of unbelief
[45:57] then what'll happen is pretty soon
[45:59] you'll start talking about it next thing
[46:01] it'll come forth it'll defile
[46:03] you Paul warned the
[46:06] Hebrews who were the Believers that they
[46:08] should not let themselves become
[46:10] hardened in their heart because the
[46:13] Bible says let not your heart become
[46:15] hardened as it was in the day of
[46:17] provocation so we look at that how can a
[46:20] heart become
[46:24] hardened brother Brenham says in the
[46:26] sermon spiritual
[46:28] Amnesia
[46:31] 1964 if one would come today like that
[46:35] it would be rejected just the
[46:38] same they had a b bad case of it
[46:41] speaking of
[46:42] Amnesia and so have they today they
[46:46] could not identify themselves with the
[46:49] supernatural things anymore because they
[46:52] didn't want it the word the gospel they
[46:55] didn't want it sin disease had affected
[46:59] them look at this now he's here's a
[47:02] prophet Discerning where it come from
[47:05] sin had affected them and they loved
[47:08] that sin is Pleasant to the unconverted
[47:13] heart it looks good to the unconverted
[47:17] mind it's the way of death there is
[47:21] nothing left but death the wages of sin
[47:24] is
[47:25] death it's so you must reap them
[47:31] wages you've swed to the winds and now
[47:34] reaping the Whirlwind amen the spiritual
[47:38] signs and the preaching of an ordained
[47:40] messenger from God never stirred them
[47:44] anymore the men could laugh right in
[47:47] their face and say I don't have to hear
[47:51] such a stuff as
[47:54] that if that hasn't repeated again what
[47:57] is it spiritual Amnesia exactly what it
[48:01] is they've forgotten that God and His
[48:04] word is the same and he cannot change
[48:07] it
[48:09] amen now remember I had talked on um
[48:13] healing the Brokenhearted and I took
[48:15] that as a subject in one of my sermons
[48:17] in
[48:18] Germany and there is a couple from um
[48:21] they're actually Filipino you you know
[48:23] them they they live in Italy their
[48:26] daughter is in nurse she works with some
[48:28] of the
[48:29] highest um uh heart doctors and
[48:34] cardiologists in Europe but especially
[48:37] right there in Italy and she came up to
[48:40] me and she says brother Ron she says I
[48:43] want you to know I work with some of the
[48:46] highest heart specialists here in Europe
[48:50] and she said and a doctor during the
[48:53] time of heart transplant if the the one
[48:57] who is having his heart transplanted
[48:59] into one who needs a new heart if he's
[49:02] ever been brokenhearted he'll never do
[49:05] the he'll never do the surgery he says
[49:08] because the broken heart has got scars
[49:11] and has got all kinds of things and it
[49:14] he said they just wouldn't do it I
[49:17] thought that was
[49:18] extremely uh interesting and she began
[49:21] to to tell me the terminology of what I
[49:23] said and how that uh uh
[49:28] uh a person could die actually of a
[49:30] brokenhearted she said oh that's
[49:33] medical uh definitions that is medical
[49:38] terminology and so I thought that very
[49:40] very
[49:43] interesting so
[49:45] it's important that we not only guard
[49:47] our own
[49:48] heart but we learn to guard the heart of
[49:53] others you know even brother Brenham
[49:55] said in the way that we chastise or
[49:58] correct our children if we do it in
[50:00] Anger he says even how the scripture
[50:03] says look you should uh have this
[50:07] discernment that the way that thou
[50:10] chastises their your children God will
[50:13] do that to
[50:15] you so God help us H to never chase and
[50:19] chastise correct our children in anger
[50:23] because generally you're doing it
[50:25] wrong and he says you grieve that angel
[50:29] that's around that CH and you grieve the
[50:31] Holy Spirit God help us huh we should
[50:34] correct with
[50:38] love there are many conditions of the
[50:41] heart that the Bible talks about I
[50:43] mentioned them earlier about the heart
[50:46] hardened heart about a clean heart about
[50:49] a pure heart how about an uncircumcised
[50:53] heart how about a forgiving heart for
[50:56] forgiveness is one of those things that
[50:58] comes from the
[51:00] heart when we say that we forgive
[51:03] someone it must come from the heart not
[51:05] from the head because you're you're just
[51:07] saying well I forgive you and you still
[51:09] have this animosity and some kind of
[51:11] resentment down inside and uh uh you
[51:14] know you might say something like well I
[51:16] forgive you but God's going to take you
[51:18] to
[51:19] task well hey you know what listen you
[51:22] let God you don't need to tell them that
[51:24] just tell them hey I I forgive you and
[51:27] forgiveness is one of the greatest acts
[51:29] that we can do of kindness and godliness
[51:33] while we're here on Earth to forgive
[51:37] someone and you know it's hard for us if
[51:40] you've been raised in a family where uh
[51:43] you ever had the the boys go to getting
[51:46] out of line and one comes by and socks
[51:48] the other one and so what he does the
[51:51] one that he hit the other one's got to
[51:53] hit him back harder and pretty soon it's
[51:56] it's a freefor all and uh sibling
[52:00] rivalry it's a terrible thing and uh you
[52:03] know you don't forgive and I hey you
[52:05] know yeah listen I forgive you but I
[52:07] don't forget well that's not a Godly
[52:10] attribute I thank God that he's got a
[52:13] sea
[52:14] of forgetfulness that he can drop all
[52:17] Hey listen if God can do that with us
[52:19] what about us being able to do it with
[52:22] others but because we're
[52:24] human ah we tend to to to not easily
[52:27] forget but God help us to forgive and
[52:30] forgive from the heart because if you
[52:32] don't you have animosities you have all
[52:35] kinds of things that come up that defile
[52:38] your spirit and you find out that you
[52:41] just you you become uh one of those it's
[52:44] a grumbling complaining nothing's never
[52:48] good nothing's never right and um that's
[52:52] just not the attributes of God
[52:56] right now when I began to think about
[52:59] the third pool and understand this
[53:03] because brother Brenham now comes into
[53:05] the changing of his ministry from first
[53:08] and second PLL from all of the
[53:10] evangelism and he comes into the third
[53:12] pole of his
[53:13] ministry he's up in Sabino
[53:17] Canyon excuse
[53:19] me he's praying about a vision that he's
[53:22] had that's a blast that he thinks he's
[53:24] going to die now you all know that he
[53:27] says I think you know God may be taking
[53:30] me off the scene I've told Billy ball
[53:33] instructed him uh look Billy I may not
[53:36] be coming home can you imagine the
[53:37] pressure he's
[53:39] got and uh so uh you all remember he's
[53:43] praying what does vision mean now what
[53:46] appeared in his hand sword a
[53:49] sword and a sword is likened unto the
[53:53] word of God which is a sharp two-edged
[53:55] sword yeah so God is now taking his
[53:58] ministry in the third pool is actually
[54:02] that Discerning ability to discern
[54:05] between the spirit and the
[54:08] soul and to actually cut it down he said
[54:10] you can have the Holy Spirit on your
[54:13] spirit you can speak in tongues shout
[54:15] Jump cast out devil you could do all
[54:17] this kind of stuff and on your way to
[54:20] hell and he says and and the the soul as
[54:25] black as night yeah God help us to not
[54:29] just have an anointing on the outer
[54:32] court or the inner Court without going
[54:35] to the holy of
[54:37] holies
[54:40] amen
[54:42] so we know the the Bible says in Hebrews
[54:47] 4:12 for the word of God is quick so
[54:50] what's coming to the
[54:53] prophet up there in Sabino Canyon
[54:57] the word of the
[55:00] Lord remember the angel tells him this
[55:03] is the third pole didn't say this will
[55:06] be or there's coming no he said this is
[55:10] the third pole this is the Vindication
[55:12] of your ministry now stop here a second
[55:16] think of all of the thousands of people
[55:19] he's preached to it India and Africa and
[55:22] the great revivals that he's had he said
[55:24] this is the vindication of your
[55:27] ministry wow I thought God had already
[55:30] Vindicated him but the Vindication is
[55:32] that the word of God now is going to
[55:35] come and it's going to divide us under
[55:38] there from from your spirit and your
[55:43] soul and there's is where brother
[55:45] Brenham could preach on the sermon the
[55:47] anointed ones at the end
[55:49] time and I remember the first time ever
[55:52] hearing the anointed ones of the end
[55:54] time I thought it was the false anointed
[55:57] ones at the end time because he he
[56:00] States it kind of like that a few times
[56:03] he said no it's the genuine Holy Spirit
[56:07] even on false
[56:09] seed and he says and here they are doing
[56:12] all of these works and he says just to
[56:15] show you he says that you can have the
[56:19] spirit on your spirit activating gifts
[56:22] of the Spirit and your soul is on its
[56:25] way to hell it never the control room of
[56:29] giving your heart completely to God has
[56:32] not taken
[56:33] place oh God we need God to come in and
[56:37] sit on the control room of our
[56:43] heart all right Hebrews 4:12 for the
[56:45] word of God is
[56:47] quick and
[56:49] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[56:53] sword piercing even to the dividing us
[56:56] under of Soul and Spirit so that the
[57:00] word of God is the only thing that can
[57:03] divide better than a laser or a scalpel
[57:07] or the sharpest thing that we have
[57:10] because now it's going to divide us
[57:13] under between the spirit and the
[57:16] soul and then joins in the marrow and
[57:18] the discerner now watch this is a
[57:21] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[57:24] the heart so the word of God many times
[57:26] will come even while a minister is
[57:29] speaking and brother
[57:31] meno us ministers that have been behind
[57:35] the pulpit a few times and people say oh
[57:39] thank you so much for that sermon that
[57:41] really touched me oh and a lot of times
[57:44] we didn't know who it was for but we
[57:47] said it because we felt led to say it
[57:50] well what God was doing God in heaven
[57:53] was sending down a channel to a gift
[57:56] behind the pulpit so it would speak to
[57:59] you and you would catch and say oh my
[58:01] he's speaking directly to
[58:04] me I've had people come up and say who
[58:07] told
[58:08] you who told you what you know I said
[58:11] nobody told me I remember one time very
[58:15] specifically my translator brother
[58:18] ladislav zalis over in in Poland he's a
[58:21] cish brother but he was my Polish
[58:24] translator and we got together and I
[58:27] gave him my scriptures and and we
[58:29] preached our sermon when we were done he
[58:32] had the elders take him outside and I
[58:34] saw them all speaking to now I don't
[58:36] speak Polish but I read uh body language
[58:40] and I can
[58:43] tell and he's
[58:47] going and and so anyway later I said
[58:50] what was that all about he said brother
[58:53] Ron what you had preached on was so
[58:55] specific
[58:56] they were such issues within our church
[58:59] they all assumed I told you so you'd
[59:02] preach on
[59:03] it see well listen that's just the word
[59:07] of
[59:07] Goden and so it is there are times even
[59:11] in a service where there might be 500
[59:13] people in the church but God is
[59:16] Discerning and taking one person and and
[59:19] very specifically giving them a
[59:23] word amen
[59:26] and yet I believe God in his infinite
[59:29] grace and mercy that when the word of
[59:31] God is going forth he's going to give
[59:34] something if you're
[59:36] sensitized and if you're ready and if
[59:38] you're listening everyone no matter if
[59:41] you're a babe in Christ or if you're a
[59:43] mature
[59:45] adult God is going to give you something
[59:48] through the ministry why the word of God
[59:50] will never return unto him
[59:53] void it will always accomplish ACC that
[59:56] which it's intended to
[1:00:00] do so the Holy Spirit began to
[1:00:03] discern among many
[1:00:05] Believers and how they're anointed in
[1:00:08] their flesh or their Spirit realm but
[1:00:10] not down in the soul or the
[1:00:13] heart in fact just before
[1:00:16] service Sandy was had turned on a tape
[1:00:21] while I was in my office and she's
[1:00:22] getting her hair ready and she's
[1:00:25] listening to the sermon three kinds of
[1:00:28] Believers and he says in every
[1:00:33] assembly but not in
[1:00:35] mine everybody else's I feel sorry
[1:00:38] brother meno you know you but in mine I
[1:00:43] only no as much as we would want to brag
[1:00:46] and like to think everybody's
[1:00:48] predestinated elect of God ordained of
[1:00:50] God bride of Christ they're
[1:00:54] not there's three kinds of Believers in
[1:00:57] every assembly and your life right now
[1:01:01] is bearing witness of which you are are
[1:01:04] you a True
[1:01:06] Believer are you living by the word or
[1:01:09] are you a make believer are you a crow
[1:01:12] putting in Dove feathers and saying look
[1:01:14] at me I'm a I'm a
[1:01:17] dove are you an unbeliever I never did
[1:01:20] believe that now sometimes you have
[1:01:23] those sitting in the church and they'll
[1:01:25] sit right among you for years until
[1:01:28] something
[1:01:30] triggers and then all of a sudden you
[1:01:32] wonder where did they go what
[1:01:36] happened it happens in every Church
[1:01:39] brother Bram said right there in his own
[1:01:42] assembly now let's take now my subject
[1:01:46] that I was talking about the the heart
[1:01:49] of the
[1:01:50] matter because there are many
[1:01:53] Believers even among Message Church is
[1:01:56] today that that is the problem the heart
[1:01:59] of the matter is their heart has never
[1:02:02] been fully given over to God they've got
[1:02:06] an intellectual conception they follow
[1:02:08] along they've been born into it right
[1:02:11] they just kind of follow along well this
[1:02:13] is what we do my family are believers so
[1:02:15] therefore it makes me a Believer no it
[1:02:18] doesn't every man works out his own
[1:02:20] salvation with fear and
[1:02:22] trembling one thing about Sandy and I
[1:02:24] when we came to this message you know we
[1:02:26] hadn't we weren't raised up around it
[1:02:28] our our mother and father were not
[1:02:30] message
[1:02:32] Believers so that when God opened our
[1:02:35] eyes it was it was something so precious
[1:02:39] amen that we we forsook
[1:02:42] all Sand's own
[1:02:45] father was so upset with her that he
[1:02:49] wanted her out of the house she left her
[1:02:52] house she's got eight brothers three
[1:02:55] sisters and bless bless her heart she
[1:02:56] left her house with
[1:02:59] two cardboard sacks you know you get
[1:03:02] from the gr grocery store full of her
[1:03:05] clothes and she left because he said you
[1:03:08] know he he just told her some pretty
[1:03:11] rough things because she didn't believe
[1:03:13] quote the Catholic Church she was raised
[1:03:17] in the Catholic church she said
[1:03:21] prayers she was a good girl she never
[1:03:24] gave her daddy one kind of
[1:03:27] problem the only time that she ever
[1:03:29] really got a real licking in her life
[1:03:32] she she crawled out the window cuz a
[1:03:35] couple of her girlfriends asked her to
[1:03:37] go to a young
[1:03:38] life uh meeting that night and uh her
[1:03:42] Daddy had said no you're not going to go
[1:03:44] well she snuck out the window and
[1:03:47] went and uh later I think the father
[1:03:50] came by her bedroom somehow he found out
[1:03:53] that she's not there and he waited up
[1:03:55] till so she got home crawled through the
[1:03:58] window again
[1:03:59] uh-huh well I'll tell you
[1:04:02] she she knew her daddy's anger then and
[1:04:06] I tell you
[1:04:07] he I'm I'm going to use these words he
[1:04:09] beat her cuz she couldn't
[1:04:13] walk and uh she never forgot and all she
[1:04:17] was doing is going to a Christian you
[1:04:19] know young life it wasn't it wasn't
[1:04:22] Catholic it wasn't sanctioned by the
[1:04:25] Catholic Church
[1:04:27] church and it wasn't she's going out and
[1:04:30] drinking and
[1:04:31] smoking no she she she has told me she
[1:04:37] says honey she says I've as a little
[1:04:41] girl I would always say my
[1:04:45] prayers and once I got
[1:04:48] done saying my prayers then I would talk
[1:04:52] to
[1:04:53] God she said I've always had a
[1:04:56] relationship with
[1:04:58] God and you know it's not reciting a
[1:05:02] prayer it's not heal Maries or
[1:05:06] uh all of the different things that you
[1:05:08] do and say and you memorize this prayer
[1:05:11] and you say it 50 times and you do
[1:05:13] Penance for
[1:05:15] no but you know I had a young boy this
[1:05:19] 12-year-old boy in Germany who had just
[1:05:21] given his heart to the
[1:05:23] Lord he says well what do I do when I
[1:05:27] pray I said just talk to God he says
[1:05:30] well how do I do that I said how do you
[1:05:32] talk to a
[1:05:33] friend he says well we just take an
[1:05:36] interest and we start talking about it I
[1:05:39] said well that's the way it is with God
[1:05:40] I said uh just start talking to
[1:05:45] him so the heart of the matter for many
[1:05:48] Believers is a subject
[1:05:50] of what's in your
[1:05:53] heart how is your heart doing
[1:05:57] you know the word of God is the answer
[1:06:00] to all of our problems to all of our
[1:06:03] troubles boil it all down hey the fact
[1:06:06] of the matter is the heart of the matter
[1:06:08] is something's wrong right here I can
[1:06:11] see in your heart that's why brother
[1:06:13] Brenham under
[1:06:15] discernment okay they would come up in
[1:06:18] the prayer line and he he doesn't see
[1:06:21] anything physically
[1:06:23] wrong but he says no I feel there's
[1:06:26] something on your
[1:06:27] heart see now he's
[1:06:32] Discerning
[1:06:37] so I am so amazed at how many times the
[1:06:42] prophet of God during a time of a prayer
[1:06:46] line that he actually discerns their
[1:06:50] heart there's nothing physically now it
[1:06:54] may show up in physical Realms like an
[1:06:58] example I've used it before that woman
[1:07:00] who comes up and he says oh I see you're
[1:07:02] a Christian I feel that that comforting
[1:07:05] spirit I feel that welcoming Spirit but
[1:07:08] there's something wrong it's something
[1:07:10] oh I see I see a Blackness I oh I see
[1:07:13] what it is it's a lie someone St a lie
[1:07:16] on you and that man claims to be divine
[1:07:19] healer and he said you're a
[1:07:22] witch and and says you're not a witch
[1:07:25] and he says in this hard trouble that
[1:07:27] you got bothering you he said that's
[1:07:29] because of the lie and he says why you
[1:07:33] and he doesn't you know sit for her no
[1:07:37] you know what he says you just go on
[1:07:38] your way there's nothing wrong with you
[1:07:40] you're not a witch go and serve
[1:07:43] God and she walks away she was delivered
[1:07:47] what was God doing
[1:07:49] Discerning the word of God coming to the
[1:07:52] prophet Discerning between the spirit
[1:07:54] and the soul
[1:07:58] so if you have Christ in your heart and
[1:08:01] as I showed you the quote the other day
[1:08:02] brother brandham said that the heart of
[1:08:05] God is Jesus
[1:08:07] Christ and when the Heart of Jesus
[1:08:10] Christ comes into your heart it changes
[1:08:14] your heart create in me a clean
[1:08:17] heart soften my heart with oil we sing
[1:08:22] all of these songs about the heart
[1:08:25] and brother Brenham says in the
[1:08:27] infallible proof of the Resurrection the
[1:08:29] sin question is settled when the Holy
[1:08:32] Spirit comes into the human
[1:08:35] heart it casts down reasoning it goes
[1:08:38] above our intellectual Affair now today
[1:08:42] the reason so many ups and downs and
[1:08:45] things are enter into the religious
[1:08:48] people because there's an intellectual
[1:08:50] conception of
[1:08:52] Christ in other words in their mind mind
[1:08:55] and not in their heart do you see that
[1:09:00] this is where I as a minister in every
[1:09:03] Minister I think his desire is God let
[1:09:07] what we preach not just tickle the ears
[1:09:11] and and do something to the mind but go
[1:09:13] beyond the Mind into the
[1:09:16] heart and we as
[1:09:19] pastors and preachers sometimes you can
[1:09:22] preach uh against all these things but
[1:09:25] some sometimes what you do is you just
[1:09:27] kind of instead of going after those
[1:09:29] things appeal to their
[1:09:32] heart like if your children are having a
[1:09:34] real hard time what do you do I'm gonna
[1:09:36] ground you I tell you you're not gonna I
[1:09:38] tell I'm taking this away
[1:09:42] and and all you got the kids are just
[1:09:45] waiting for Dad to just shut
[1:09:48] up it it ain't helping
[1:09:51] nothing I'm going to ground you you're
[1:09:54] not going to this and that okay okay but
[1:09:57] how about sitting on the edge of the
[1:10:00] bed saying
[1:10:02] son I see you're
[1:10:05] struggling I I just come in here to pray
[1:10:07] for you I was once a young man the apple
[1:10:11] don't fall far from the
[1:10:13] tree I know what it was like as a young
[1:10:16] kid and this and that and all of a
[1:10:18] sudden you talk and the all of a sudden
[1:10:21] you appeal to their heart that's right
[1:10:23] that's good and you're not yelling at
[1:10:25] him you're just saying hey you know I
[1:10:27] can't force
[1:10:30] you I can ground you I can do all this
[1:10:33] stuff but it's not because of the
[1:10:36] law it's because of
[1:10:39] Love why are we serving God is it out of
[1:10:42] a lawful thing that I've got to do this
[1:10:45] and God in heaven is is waiting in
[1:10:48] heaven for me to step out of line and
[1:10:49] then
[1:10:51] wh you're dust man you're you're going
[1:10:54] to pay for that
[1:10:56] buddy oh I thank God that he's not like
[1:10:59] that he's a he's a mindful God he's a
[1:11:02] just God he's a forgiving
[1:11:08] God let me finish this quote here
[1:11:12] see they just mentally believe
[1:11:14] it and your mental will reason could it
[1:11:17] be so could Divine Healing be so could
[1:11:20] the baptism of the spirit be so now
[1:11:22] that's intellectual reasoning see when
[1:11:25] that comes into the heart it's
[1:11:28] Faith it's positive there's no question
[1:11:32] at all about it settled
[1:11:34] forever it's in your heart and your
[1:11:37] heart doesn't reason because it's the
[1:11:40] throne The Dwelling Place of the
[1:11:44] almighty is in the
[1:11:48] heart let me say that again The Dwelling
[1:11:52] Place what house are you going to build
[1:11:55] in
[1:11:57] y the dwelling
[1:11:59] place is the human heart the heart is
[1:12:03] the control room for
[1:12:06] God the unity of one God in the one
[1:12:09] Church you see the little part
[1:12:10] compartment in a man's heart God made
[1:12:13] that in there for
[1:12:15] himself that's his control
[1:12:20] room he sets there to control you that's
[1:12:24] his place
[1:12:26] that's where he sends his messages from
[1:12:29] the control
[1:12:30] room did they have that quote up there
[1:12:33] are you following along with me did you
[1:12:36] okay let's finish this quot quote if you
[1:12:39] have it if you don't go home go home and
[1:12:41] read it
[1:12:42] because it's in the unity of one God and
[1:12:45] one
[1:12:46] church but when he comes
[1:12:48] in to be a new
[1:12:51] creature and the old man has passed out
[1:12:55] and the new man Christ takes his throne
[1:12:58] in the human heart then life looks
[1:13:01] different then he starts on a new road
[1:13:04] from his new from his own selfish
[1:13:07] motives till the big idea is to make
[1:13:10] himself something big he starts right
[1:13:12] towards Calvary to recognize God then
[1:13:15] his all his objective his motive his
[1:13:18] achievement all that he is lays in the
[1:13:22] glory of the Cross where Christ paid the
[1:13:24] price for human life Christ is our life
[1:13:30] somebody say Amen to
[1:13:33] that it's not the operating of the gifts
[1:13:36] of the
[1:13:37] Spirit or the speaking in
[1:13:40] tongues that is the evidence of the holy
[1:13:44] spirit in your soul now let me show you
[1:13:47] a couple this is a pergan church age I
[1:13:50] hope we have these quotes here pergami
[1:13:53] and church age here is p
[1:13:55] 164 and for the sake of time tonight and
[1:13:58] I'm not a a real good reader I want you
[1:14:01] to to note very carefully that Jesus did
[1:14:06] not say that the evidence of being
[1:14:09] baptized with the Holy Ghost was
[1:14:11] speaking in tongues interpreting
[1:14:15] prophesying or shouting and
[1:14:18] dancing he said the evidence would be
[1:14:21] that you would be in the
[1:14:23] truth amen the evidence would be that
[1:14:26] you're in the truth now I want to ask
[1:14:29] you what is
[1:14:36] truth Jesus said I am the way the truth
[1:14:40] and the
[1:14:41] life and no man comes to the father but
[1:14:44] by
[1:14:45] me it says that the evidence would be
[1:14:49] that you would be in the
[1:14:51] truth you would be in the word of God
[1:14:54] for your age
[1:14:59] age evidence has to do with receiving
[1:15:02] that
[1:15:04] word evidence has to do with receiving
[1:15:07] the
[1:15:09] word that's
[1:15:11] what Sarah did where she had been
[1:15:16] receiving Seed of Abraham for
[1:15:19] years and God was speaking to Abraham
[1:15:23] you're going to have a son
[1:15:25] and it's going to be through
[1:15:27] Sarah but Sarah herself had to come the
[1:15:32] promise was given to Abraham but was to
[1:15:34] be made manifest in Sarah and it
[1:15:37] couldn't manifest until she said be it
[1:15:40] unto me according to Thy
[1:15:44] word the Bible says and Sarah by
[1:15:49] faith receive
[1:15:51] strength to conceive seed not receive
[1:15:54] seed
[1:15:55] to conceive she'd been receiving
[1:15:58] Abraham's seed since she was a young
[1:16:03] woman but
[1:16:05] now one day Faith set upon her
[1:16:09] heart and that word
[1:16:13] conceived and took
[1:16:17] life paragraph
[1:16:20] 169 the evidence of receiving the Holy
[1:16:23] Ghost today is just the same it was back
[1:16:25] in the day of our
[1:16:27] lord it's receiving the word of Truth
[1:16:31] for the day in which you
[1:16:35] live we call it the message of the
[1:16:40] hour recognizing your
[1:16:43] day and its
[1:16:46] message Jesus never did stress the
[1:16:49] importance of the works as he did the
[1:16:51] word he knew that if the people got the
[1:16:54] word Works would follow that's the
[1:16:59] Bible paragraph
[1:17:01] 272 now I'm sure that you have noticed
[1:17:05] that those whose names were in The Book
[1:17:08] of Life were a part of the religious
[1:17:11] order of that day religious order of
[1:17:15] that
[1:17:17] day that centered around the true God
[1:17:21] and worship of
[1:17:22] him do you catch this yeah so these are
[1:17:27] churchgoing people they're good people
[1:17:30] people do not go to church to do
[1:17:34] bad so it's centered around religious
[1:17:37] order and around the true God and
[1:17:41] worship of him though they did not
[1:17:44] worship according to the truth according
[1:17:46] to the truth brother Bram said the
[1:17:51] word like Judas they didn't go all the
[1:17:54] way
[1:17:55] see how Judas was chosen of
[1:18:00] God he was instructed in truth he shared
[1:18:04] the knowledge of the
[1:18:06] Mysteries he had a Ministry of power
[1:18:09] granted unto him and he healed the sick
[1:18:11] and cast out devils in jesus'
[1:18:14] name but when The Showdown came he sold
[1:18:16] out for gold and political power he did
[1:18:18] not go up to Pentecost to receive the
[1:18:21] spirit of God he was devor void of the
[1:18:25] spirit make no mistake about it a person
[1:18:30] that is truly
[1:18:31] baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body
[1:18:35] of
[1:18:37] Christ receiving the
[1:18:40] fullness of the spirit will be in the
[1:18:43] word all the
[1:18:47] way I didn't capitalize or put I tell
[1:18:50] you know word all the way that's him
[1:18:55] that is the
[1:18:57] evidence of being baptized with the Holy
[1:18:59] Ghost Judas failed multitudes fall right
[1:19:04] there and when they fail to go on in
[1:19:07] that word their names are taken off the
[1:19:10] Book of Life notice taking off The Book
[1:19:12] of Life Book of Life not Lamb's Book of
[1:19:15] Life that's right there's a vast
[1:19:19] difference he said your once your name
[1:19:21] is on the Lamb's Book of Life he said
[1:19:23] when was it put on there before the
[1:19:26] foundation of the world see those who
[1:19:28] have their names on the Lamb's Book of
[1:19:31] Life Will Follow the word all the way
[1:19:34] they can't help it there's something
[1:19:36] drawing them something pulling them they
[1:19:39] cannot deny their very birth God cannot
[1:19:43] deny when you give back to God the
[1:19:46] Revelation he gives to you he cannot
[1:19:48] deny
[1:19:49] it when you give it back to him the
[1:19:52] Holiness in dress the long hair the
[1:19:56] without makeup all of those things when
[1:19:58] you give that back to God God said
[1:20:00] that's
[1:20:04] righteousness why because it's his
[1:20:09] word don't you know that it's an
[1:20:11] Abomination for a woman to put on
[1:20:13] clothes that pertains to a
[1:20:15] man it's an
[1:20:18] Abomination I want to ask you how many
[1:20:20] preachers outside of this message are
[1:20:22] preaching something like that
[1:20:24] huh Noah women are in their pants suits
[1:20:28] women preachers shorts right cut hair
[1:20:34] right and I'm not trying to judge them I
[1:20:37] I I'm just saying what he
[1:20:41] said okay now watch the word of God is
[1:20:44] is a
[1:20:46] sharp two-edged sword Discerning now
[1:20:48] between spirit and soul what brother Ron
[1:20:51] you saying they're bad I didn't say
[1:20:53] they're bad people
[1:20:56] is that the Holy Spirit anointing them
[1:21:00] absolutely do you think they're
[1:21:01] worshiping God
[1:21:06] absolutely but in
[1:21:08] vain do they worship him why they're not
[1:21:11] in
[1:21:13] truth they're not in
[1:21:19] truth
[1:21:22] now let me see here
[1:21:25] it's a known
[1:21:27] fact that those that have left the what
[1:21:30] we call the
[1:21:32] message they could have never had the
[1:21:34] Holy
[1:21:36] Spirit the oh on their on their Spirit
[1:21:39] yes could they have bethl anointings
[1:21:42] bethl experiences absolutely many people
[1:21:46] have bethl experiences Jacob had bethl
[1:21:49] experiences saw angels descending and
[1:21:52] descending he said this is an awful
[1:21:54] place why wow he saw all kinds of
[1:21:57] Supernatural things never changed his
[1:22:00] life until he come to a place called
[1:22:04] pineal where he says I met
[1:22:08] God face to face and I wrestled with him
[1:22:14] the problem with people
[1:22:16] today is they don't
[1:22:18] wrestle with God enough they don't
[1:22:21] wrestle until is this is this message
[1:22:24] really
[1:22:26] true if there's anyone here that you
[1:22:29] have this question within your
[1:22:31] mind get
[1:22:34] alone go off have some time pray and
[1:22:38] fast and ask God is this true will you
[1:22:42] show me something will you give me a
[1:22:46] sign hey you know
[1:22:50] what he's he'll do something
[1:22:54] but if you're so stubborn and
[1:22:56] hard-headed and like a horse that's
[1:22:58] grabbed the bit and pull it in his mouth
[1:23:00] if you ever had a horse run away with
[1:23:02] you and they grab the bit in their teeth

[1:23:15] in there and I loosened up the bridal
[1:23:18] and I I saw the mouth until red Foams
[1:23:20] coming out there in other words I'm
[1:23:22] sensitizing his mouth
[1:23:25] sounds a little rough doesn't it but
[1:23:27] some of you need a
[1:23:28] snaffle a twisted snaffle and you need
[1:23:31] God to kind of saw your mouth a little
[1:23:33] bit cuz you got a hard mouth and you you
[1:23:35] just run away at anything and this this
[1:23:38] this old guy he was only three years old
[1:23:40] and he Appaloosa and there he was he was
[1:23:42] running away with me and I'm whoa whoa
[1:23:44] whoa and I he couldn't pull up so I
[1:23:46] reached down and with my left hand I
[1:23:49] grabbed right near the the bridal and
[1:23:51] the bit I pulled his face around and and
[1:23:54] and we're running at a full
[1:23:56] gallon and I got him looking at me and I
[1:23:59] went Bo I hit him as hard as I could let
[1:24:03] the head go and he almost fell with
[1:24:05] me then he slowed down I said yeah when
[1:24:08] I say wo I mean
[1:24:14] wo sometimes we get so hardheaded
[1:24:20] hard-hearted and when you do God may
[1:24:23] have to do drastic
[1:24:25] measures listen to
[1:24:27] me did it with Billy Paul Billy was hard
[1:24:32] daddy I'm going to run off and get
[1:24:33] married what brother brand he's out
[1:24:35] washing the car oh Billy go butt your
[1:24:39] head against the
[1:24:40] wall That's foolish you're just a young
[1:24:43] but yeah well Daddy I'm serious I'm Oh
[1:24:47] Billy he goes out and gets married right
[1:24:51] and they have to anull it because she
[1:24:52] was underage and Billy Paul was was
[1:24:55] underage and they went and annulled the
[1:24:57] marriage then they asked brother Brenham
[1:24:58] questions and answers brother Brenham is
[1:25:01] annulment the same as divorce yeah yeah
[1:25:05] he says this he says this kills me to
[1:25:07] have to tell you guys this he said but
[1:25:10] my own son went out here and he run off
[1:25:14] and the other father and I we had to go
[1:25:15] on an old the marriage and he said I
[1:25:17] couldn't even go to his
[1:25:19] wedding he he said I couldn't bless his
[1:25:22] wedding
[1:25:26] and
[1:25:27] then but he never stopped Billy from
[1:25:30] coming to church because he had done
[1:25:33] wrong okay andone he he married
[1:25:37] Lois okay which would have been his
[1:25:39] second marriage so anybody
[1:25:43] that's critical on somebody that's been
[1:25:46] double married or had an issue in their
[1:25:50] past then you would have been very
[1:25:53] critical of brother Billy Paul ever come
[1:25:55] up and prayed over the meeting or prayed
[1:25:58] for
[1:26:02] people people sometimes do crazy
[1:26:08] things okay because they're not thinking
[1:26:11] right the words not down their
[1:26:14] heart and Lois and Billy had full four
[1:26:20] full-time
[1:26:21] babies have you been to the gravide
[1:26:25] and you seen the small little stones
[1:26:27] with the little lambs on top four of
[1:26:29] them brother Brenham finally went before
[1:26:32] God and he said hasn't Billy and Lois
[1:26:35] suffered
[1:26:38] enough he said all of a sudden I broke
[1:26:40] into a vision I saw Billy holding a
[1:26:42] little blue a baby in a blue Bank
[1:26:46] blanket brother Ram said it kills me to
[1:26:49] have to say these
[1:26:50] things he says my my my own son he says
[1:26:54] he would have even had a great ministry
[1:26:56] but he said but you know what he messed
[1:26:57] it up because he goes out here and he
[1:26:59] marries the wrong
[1:27:00] one so on marriage and divorce let me
[1:27:03] tell you brother Brenham never changes
[1:27:06] his his viewpoint on that he said now
[1:27:09] before I had thus sayith the Lord on it
[1:27:12] we had we had a Northwest and a
[1:27:14] Northeast but it wasn't a true north and
[1:27:17] he said this highest side hit the ditch
[1:27:20] all Grace this side all long both of
[1:27:22] them hitting the ditch
[1:27:25] oh God help us huh amen
[1:27:29] now I had made a statement with those
[1:27:31] that have left the message and I'm not
[1:27:33] talking about uh anyone in particular
[1:27:36] I'm talk let's just Universal around the
[1:27:38] world I just came from Germany where uh
[1:27:42] a young pastor and and his wife 25 years
[1:27:45] pastoring the church here gets up and
[1:27:47] tells in front of his CH in front of his
[1:27:49] church without any um warning or
[1:27:53] anything he said I want to ask all of
[1:27:55] you to forgive me I've been following a
[1:27:58] false prophet for 25 years brother
[1:28:00] bram's a false prophet can you
[1:28:04] imagine and so I was facing some of
[1:28:07] these issues when I went over there in
[1:28:10] Germany because now that couple is going
[1:28:13] around not satisfied to just leave the
[1:28:17] church they now are going to anyone that
[1:28:21] will listen to them of why brother
[1:28:23] Bramson false false
[1:28:25] prophet I had to one brother one time he

[1:29:01] somebody can talk you out of this
[1:29:03] message you never were in
[1:29:06] it am I'm
[1:29:09] sorry and so I had to address some of
[1:29:13] these things with the pastor and his
[1:29:15] associate just personally because issues
[1:29:19] are coming
[1:29:20] up and they say well there's such a the
[1:29:23] the like this young couple said now

[1:29:44] worship and he is love and God and we
[1:29:47] can worship

[1:29:55] Liberty because you shall know the
[1:29:58] truth and the truth shall set you
[1:30:05] free if you've got Christ in your
[1:30:08] heart it'll not be some legalistic side
[1:30:11] if I kept the law no it's going to be
[1:30:14] because you're in love with him why do
[1:30:16] you dress the way you do cuz I love him
[1:30:19] amen oh I think you're doing it because
[1:30:22] it's a self-righteous
[1:30:24] some are I'll admit that there are some
[1:30:27] maybe here right
[1:30:29] tonight they're wearing a dress and
[1:30:31] they're just as hypocritical as they
[1:30:32] could
[1:30:34] be yep there are hypocrites yep yep yep
[1:30:38] do I deny that no I don't but what about
[1:30:41] the true what about the True Believers
[1:30:44] what about the ones that have stayed
[1:30:45] true what about the ones who are still
[1:30:47] in love with God it don't matter and if
[1:30:50] it was their Pastor or their father or
[1:30:52] somebody else and they left they never
[1:30:55] left they stayed true with the word of
[1:30:59] God Amen that's the kind of church that
[1:31:01] God has coming after you're going to be
[1:31:04] tempted and tried things are going to
[1:31:05] come your
[1:31:10] way infallible proof of the Resurrection
[1:31:13] 57 the sin question is settled when the
[1:31:17] Holy Spirit comes into the human
[1:31:21] heart I read that one didn't I
[1:31:24] okay let's go
[1:31:26] on let me read to you in Romans chap 2
[1:31:30] verse 14 and
[1:31:32] 15 and when the Gentiles which have not
[1:31:37] the
[1:31:37] law do by Nature the things contained in
[1:31:42] the
[1:31:43] law these having not the law have a law
[1:31:46] unto
[1:31:49] themselves which show the work of the
[1:31:51] law written where
[1:31:53] in their hearts Gentiles who have not
[1:31:57] the law who weren't in the message who
[1:31:59] never heard the message who never knew
[1:32:01] the Native Indians
[1:32:03] whoever make whatever the
[1:32:07] Gentiles who have a law W written within
[1:32:11] their hearts their conscience also
[1:32:14] bearing
[1:32:15] witness and their thought and their
[1:32:18] thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else
[1:32:22] excusing one another
[1:32:25] let me tell you what uh they've designed
[1:32:28] a a little meter system put a little
[1:32:30] light detector put some things on your
[1:32:32] finger something on top of your head and
[1:32:35] said where were you on the night of such
[1:32:37] and such uh were you at home yes or the
[1:32:40] needle
[1:32:41] goes they they can see cuz the guy he's
[1:32:44] got a law on his heart should I
[1:32:46] shouldn't lie but not
[1:32:55] see they've got a law written within
[1:32:57] themselves either accusing themselves or
[1:33:02] excusing they have a law within their
[1:33:07] hearts if our
[1:33:09] hearts condemn us how can we approach
[1:33:16] God a troubled
[1:33:18] heart is causes a troubled mind and a
[1:33:24] condemning heart it
[1:33:28] does when there is transgression of the
[1:33:30] word of God condemnation is ever present
[1:33:34] transgression and condemnation are
[1:33:36] always found together they're buddies do
[1:33:39] something wrong watch
[1:33:44] condemnation and transgression are
[1:33:46] always together do something wrong I
[1:33:49] feel you know and then get around here's
[1:33:52] something about message
[1:33:54] Believers go to message church and you
[1:33:57] have to understand you're godly people
[1:33:59] you're trying to do the very best that
[1:34:01] you can is that right you're trying you
[1:34:03] know you're not here trying to judge
[1:34:05] everybody else but if somebody who is
[1:34:08] transgressing the word of God comes
[1:34:10] among message believers they feel
[1:34:13] they're being
[1:34:14] judged I don't feel
[1:34:17] comfortable why are they not
[1:34:20] comfortable huh why well I I just don't
[1:34:24] feel welcome no the holy spirit is
[1:34:27] doing coming and causing you to have
[1:34:32] conviction conviction is
[1:34:34] Godly conviction is when God tells you
[1:34:37] don't do that before you do it
[1:34:41] conviction and then you transgress and
[1:34:44] step over the conviction then you come
[1:34:47] to condemnation then he can then the
[1:34:49] devil condemns
[1:34:50] you you see conviction is when God is
[1:34:53] saying oh you you no don't do that don't
[1:34:55] go there don't say that don't look at
[1:34:57] this don't do
[1:34:59] that you
[1:35:01] transgress now you have
[1:35:04] condemnation they feel condemned that's
[1:35:06] why certain ones sin comes in hardens
[1:35:10] the heart they feel unwelcomed among
[1:35:13] message Believers and they start
[1:35:15] claiming that all of the message
[1:35:18] Believers are hypocrites and
[1:35:20] self-righteous and everything and
[1:35:24] oh yeah what can you
[1:35:26] say because that's what they
[1:35:29] feel and
[1:35:33] uh you see at some time in your
[1:35:36] Christian
[1:35:37] experience you're going to fall and make
[1:35:39] a mistake all of you yeah you will
[1:35:42] musicians go ahead and come I'm
[1:35:46] closing you're either going to make a
[1:35:48] mistake
[1:35:50] willfully or
[1:35:51] unwillfully but you make a mistake
[1:35:54] you'll step over that line You'll yeah
[1:35:57] you
[1:36:00] know and you'll sin in one form or
[1:36:03] another and when you fail transgress or
[1:36:07] do iniquity step over the conviction of
[1:36:09] God then you've set yourself up as a
[1:36:11] target for the
[1:36:13] devil I thought you called yourself a
[1:36:17] Christian
[1:36:19] huh then you get to all this
[1:36:21] condemnation and you come to church and
[1:36:23] you feel
[1:36:24] I feel
[1:36:28] condemned when you feel that
[1:36:31] way
[1:36:33] repent say God I'm
[1:36:36] sorry I shouldn't have done it and he
[1:36:40] with open
[1:36:41] arms will forgive you when it comes from
[1:36:44] the heart not up here

[1:39:35] heart you wouldn't be doing
[1:39:38] that you find out
[1:39:41] that when you transgress you set
[1:39:43] yourself up for a target of the devil
