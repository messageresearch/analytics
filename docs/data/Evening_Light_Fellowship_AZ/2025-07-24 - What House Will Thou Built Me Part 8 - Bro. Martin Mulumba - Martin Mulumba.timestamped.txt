[0:00] that while we were yet sinners, you died
[0:02] for us.

[0:06] hope this evening. So, we just ask that

[0:10] enter into worship.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; And Father, as a word would go forth,
[0:14] may it fall into good ground.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, again, be with the needs of your
[0:18] people. Be with those that are
[0:20] traveling. Be with our pastor as he's

[4:30] And what a difference it makes when the
[4:33] Lord has his way. Though my life praise
[4:37] God has changed.

[13:52] Lord,
[13:53] &gt;&gt; we surely love you, Father.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; When, L, Father God, we are in love, we
[14:00] seek for fellowship.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; We seek to dwell in your tents, in your
[14:06] presence
[14:08] &gt;&gt; day and night, Father.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why we standing in thy
[14:12] house this day.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Because all that was in God was pouring
[14:17] into Christ.
[14:19] and all that was in Christ was poured
[14:21] into the church.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; And God his love and this love is being
[14:27] professed unto you today. Thank you.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; How we love you, Lord,
[14:33] for the price that you paid on the cross
[14:36] for this great plan, Lord, Father God,
[14:38] of redemption,
[14:40] for leading the way and showing the way.
[14:43] Because without way, Lord, Father God,
[14:45] there's no walking, Father. We will l
[14:48] father God know we're about to abide
[14:50] Lord Jesus.
[14:52] We will know Lord Father with that where
[14:54] to leave because only you is life.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; Everything else Lord Father God has a
[15:01] beginning and the end
[15:03] &gt;&gt; but because you loved us that's why
[15:05] you're bringing us back to eternity
[15:08] &gt;&gt; whereby we standing Lord Father God
[15:10] coair with Christ this hour
[15:13] &gt;&gt; standing in the heavenly places in
[15:15] Christ Jesus at this hour. Yes.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; May you come and join us in the meeting.
[15:19] Take over the service. Lord,
[15:22] &gt;&gt; we praise you, Lord, Father, for what
[15:23] you've done already in the song service
[15:26] through the cleaning and sound engineers
[15:30] and all the hidden offices and prayer
[15:33] warriors, Lord, in unseen places behind
[15:36] the doors. Father, such a time for to
[15:39] invite you because we know no one is
[15:41] greater among us all save Christ.
[15:45] you are Lord Father God and bring us
[15:47] higher into your presence Lord.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; We ask all these things in Jesus
[15:51] Christ's name.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless yours tonight.
[15:57] Uh while we are standing, let's uh take
[16:01] the book
[16:03] of uh Exodus chapter 40.
[16:11] We'll uh read few verses here and there
[16:14] but God's grace to
[16:17] help us uh
[16:22] take the reading tonight. Um verse 16 uh
[16:28] Exodus 40:1 16
[16:33] verse 1-6
[16:35] uh God is speaking to Moses do this go
[16:38] do that thus did Moses according to all
[16:42] that the Lord commanded him so did he so
[16:46] shall we and it came to pass in the
[16:50] first month in the second year on the
[16:52] first day of the month we understand
[16:55] that's the month of Abib um around
[16:58] probably March or April overlapping
[17:00] there that the tabernacle was read up at
[17:04] the time harvest time that the
[17:07] tabernacle was erected.
[17:09] Exodus 40:33
[17:12] he ridded up uh the court round about
[17:15] the tabernacle and the altar and set up
[17:18] the hanging of the court's gates. So
[17:21] Moses finished the work.
[17:24] He started from all the way from the
[17:26] mountain. Received the visitation,
[17:28] receive angelic visitation, he received
[17:32] the commission, he received the signs in
[17:34] the end, everything all the miracles all
[17:38] the way down to for this purpose.
[17:41] Then verse 34,
[17:44] then a cloud covered the tent of the
[17:47] congregation and the glory of the Lord
[17:49] filled the tabernacle and Moses was not
[17:52] able to enter into the tent of the
[17:54] congregation because the cloud abode
[17:57] there on. No presence of a man in the
[18:00] God's tabernacle. God himself takes over
[18:02] the work
[18:04] and the glory of the Lord filled the
[18:06] tabernacle. 36 And when the cloud was
[18:09] taken up from over the tabernacle, the
[18:12] children of Israel went onward in all
[18:15] their journeys.
[18:17] Each person with the journeys.
[18:20] We have to know our journey.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; We came from eternity. We started in uh
[18:26] Genesis 15 with the promise of the seed
[18:28] was not materialized to the seed that
[18:31] was made perfect manifest to the seed
[18:34] that had to make the choice of the
[18:37] uh of the lamp. Now the same seed now
[18:41] has ridded up the tabernacle. The
[18:45] cloud came down for this great purpose.
[18:50] But if the cloud were not taken up, then
[18:53] the journey not till the day that this
[18:57] was taken up. Every move was commanded
[19:01] by the cloud. When the cloud move,
[19:04] people move. When the cloud doesn't
[19:06] move, you can move.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; So in order to move without uh vision,
[19:12] people are wondering. For the cloud of
[19:15] the Lord was upon the tabernacle, but
[19:17] day and fire was was on it by night in
[19:21] the sight of all the house of Israel
[19:24] throughout all the journeys. May the
[19:27] Lord bless the reading of his word. You
[19:28] may be seated. Uh we'll be uh
[19:32] finishing up by God's grace uh God
[19:35] willing tonight uh with uh our little
[19:38] subject that we started from uh the
[19:41] beginning of the year. This will be part
[19:44] eight. Uh, what house wil thou build me?
[19:48] By God's grace, we'll just uh give it a
[19:51] little title, a little uh subject there
[19:55] of shalom. After working so hard
[19:58] throughout all this journey, then uh
[20:01] there's a time of fellowship. It is a
[20:05] time of shalom. after we've endured such
[20:08] uh such a great journey where about uh
[20:11] we go and uh labor so hard along the
[20:15] journey it comes to you to a point where
[20:18] we understand that oh it is the Lord
[20:20] it's been the Lord all this all this why
[20:23] because we understand that when Moses
[20:25] went up the mountain and speaking with
[20:28] uh with the Lord that people could only
[20:30] hear thunders and they couldn't
[20:32] understand what was happening but then
[20:34] there come now a time where about the
[20:37] tabernacle was erected now even Moses
[20:40] himself couldn't get into the tabernacle
[20:44] because if it's just taking what the
[20:46] pastor says well but then there's a time
[20:49] not even the pastor will understand what
[20:52] is happening Mary looked at Jesus and he
[20:54] couldn't understand what was happening
[20:56] with this boy why was this boy so
[20:59] distinct and so uh peculiar from all the
[21:03] rest of the boys in this journey I'm not
[21:05] talking about historically I'm talking
[21:07] about us because we had these people
[21:10] that once upon a time we look like
[21:13] everybody else then all this journey
[21:15] that at times that throughout the
[21:18] services and uh uh you hear the feedback
[21:21] that oh that part was a little too harsh
[21:23] and yes the the the the the gold had to
[21:27] be beaten in order to reflect the image
[21:30] of uh of of the smith of the lockmith
[21:34] because without him seeing his
[21:37] reflection, he has to go all the way in
[21:40] order to do that. So we understand that
[21:43] uh building this tabernacle is not an
[21:45] easy journey. It's not a picnic that we
[21:48] come about as we see in the world today.
[21:52] He comes on his knees and and proposes
[21:55] to you and uh takes you to the
[21:58] restaurant every day. But then then
[22:00] there will be a time he tells you go
[22:02] onto the field and go and uh get me some
[22:05] uh uh flowers and get me you go there.
[22:08] Oh, but I thought you told me to get the
[22:10] flowers. Now here all the uh the the the
[22:15] pins and all the the hurting and uh I'm
[22:18] getting into the mud and all this year
[22:21] that people are criticizing me. Yes.
[22:24] Because that's the program of erecting
[22:27] the tabernacle in order to make this
[22:30] tabernacle stand up. It was not a
[22:32] man-made desire to come and stand before
[22:36] the Lord said, "Lord, this is what I
[22:38] need to do." Like Cain came and say,
[22:40] "I'll bring some beautiful flowers and
[22:43] some good design." He said, "No, no, no,
[22:45] no, no, no. It has to be a messy work."
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; And to in today's life, we don't like
[22:52] messy work. We like everything smooth.
[22:55] Don't offend anybody. Be politically
[22:58] correct. No, no, no, no, no, no. We need
[23:00] some mercy work.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; You need your healing. Oh no. This is
[23:05] not for you. This is I can't give uh
[23:08] children bread to dogs. Oh my god. The
[23:10] pastor said that to me. I'm not going
[23:13] back to that church anymore.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; It is a messy work. And that messy work
[23:18] is a continuous messy work until we
[23:22] leave the earth.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; Until we put the seal of approbation, we
[23:27] seal the wagon and then we move on. It
[23:29] will always be a mercy work. But
[23:32] nevertheless, but then in the midst of
[23:35] all that, we receive a shalom.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; In the midst of all that mercy work,
[23:41] there is a shalom. Then you start
[23:43] wondering how come this journey is so
[23:45] hard but I'm still able to keep on.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; It's not because you are able to do it.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; Because we've seen in the book of
[23:53] Revelation is always God said go and do
[23:56] this. Tell the children of Israel go and
[23:58] do this. All throughout the journey it
[24:02] was always God said Moses did. The
[24:05] people did. God said Moses said the
[24:08] people did. Right?
[24:10] &gt;&gt; So therefore we understand the pattern.
[24:13] If God is spoken a prophet must speak
[24:16] and when the prophet speaks then we have
[24:18] to do
[24:19] &gt;&gt; and in order to do it's a hard journey
[24:24] to start to move from the earthly to the
[24:26] heavenly.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Brother say that we are very heavy in
[24:31] this dimension but we have to be lifted
[24:33] up in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[24:36] But in order to get into the heavenly
[24:39] places in Christ Jesus, as we've seen
[24:40] before, that it requires to understand a
[24:44] pattern of approaching him, in order to
[24:47] know how to approach God and how to
[24:50] receive a favor from God. You can't go
[24:53] to God and try to play and trick God and
[24:56] say like, you know, oh, you know, I I
[24:58] have need of this. You know, I promise
[25:00] you I'll be a good boy if you give me a
[25:03] housewife. If you give me a car, a job,
[25:07] a business, and all this, he knows
[25:09] what's behind all all that.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Then he has to put you to test.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; And when he puts you to test, then it's
[25:17] a hard time to wait. I've been waiting
[25:21] for a whole year for this promise to
[25:23] happen.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Abraham, I'll give you a child, but you
[25:28] have to wait 25 years. What? How's that
[25:32] even possible? I can't do that. I can't
[25:34] wait for all this time here. I am the
[25:37] Lord. Walked out before me and be
[25:39] perfect.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Really? I have to. Yes.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; And I put you there on the pedestal as
[25:46] the father of faith. Wow.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Brandom, you are the prophet. Yeah,
[25:53] that's good. But then understand the
[25:55] work that you're going to go through.
[25:57] It's going to be a messy work.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; You're going to make mistakes along the
[26:02] way.
[26:03] I'm going to punish you with Amibia.
[26:06] I'm going to punish you with all this
[26:08] year and I'm going to put you in a very
[26:11] tough position. You're going to lose
[26:13] your wife. You're going to lo lose your
[26:15] brothers. You're going to lose your
[26:16] parents.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; It is a messy work.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; That's why we read in the Bible that all
[26:24] the children of Israel in their
[26:26] journeys, each one of us, you can look
[26:29] back and you said, "Oh yeah, this is my
[26:31] journey." And we call it my my
[26:33] experience.
[26:35] That's my journey. Oh, I came from this
[26:37] humble beginnings. Oh, I didn't know
[26:40] what the message was. Oh, yes, it was a
[26:43] messy work. The time that we spend in
[26:46] prayer and supplications.
[26:48] What is this message all about? It is a
[26:51] messy work. And yet, yet you see the
[26:54] attraction of the world on one hand. Oh,
[26:57] Brennham, why don't you come with us?
[26:59] Oh, don't you have a girlfriend? You a
[27:01] Can't you smoke? Oh, look at you.
[27:03] You're not connected. You don't know
[27:05] what's going on. You don't have Oh,
[27:07] don't you are you not on Snapchat, Tik
[27:10] Tok? What kind of person are you? You're
[27:12] weird.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; A messy work.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; What a time. But in the midst of all
[27:19] that,
[27:20] &gt;&gt; he said, "Be not afraid.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; It is high."
[27:24] &gt;&gt; And he keeps giving us the journey ahead
[27:26] in order to understand. though
[27:28] misunderstood by the world but seen by
[27:32] the father that we are doing the proper
[27:35] work and this journey in which that we
[27:38] have started in the book of uh uh exodus
[27:42] uh starting in the book of Genesis with
[27:44] Abraham himself. I looked at it I said
[27:47] Lord what a what a message for myself.
[27:51] I looked at my life and I said, "Oh,
[27:55] look my look at every stage of my life."
[27:58] I came to understand even what is
[28:01] happening now with me. I said like, you
[28:03] know, for the last few weeks I was
[28:06] sitting I was like it doesn't make any
[28:08] sense.
[28:11] I'm preaching.
[28:13] I'm doing this here. I'm serving the
[28:15] Lord
[28:17] and I'm going through this. Yeah. I have
[28:20] to pay the price.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; And when I pay the pri when I pay the
[28:26] price, it may not even be seen by
[28:30] anybody outside.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; Because he's working the very inside of
[28:36] my being.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; When I come and I preach here, I will
[28:40] just go out there. So then then what's
[28:43] next? What is happening?
[28:47] I have all these ideas in my in my head,
[28:50] but I need to wait until he comes down
[28:54] and tells me what journey to take, what
[28:57] route to take. Because if we just go by
[29:00] knowledge quickly, we find ourselves
[29:03] into just verbalizing before the church,
[29:07] line up the scriptures and put it out
[29:09] there and uh then I'll just read one
[29:12] quote after another, the service is
[29:14] over.
[29:16] But then I have to pay the price.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Then I have to wait in prayer.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Even at times I've spent all these years
[29:26] alone and when you spend all that time
[29:29] then now you have somebody next to you.
[29:31] She's observing you everything you're
[29:33] doing. When is he praying? When when
[29:35] does this how how does it work?
[29:43] Then you look at it. It's like, oh, this
[29:45] is a new stage of the journey.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; People used to wonder about it from
[29:51] people from outside. Now it's somebody
[29:54] that you with 24/7.
[29:58] Then you're just like, "Oh." But I told
[30:00] her, I say, "Listen, it's not an
[30:02] external work. It's an inside work."
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Because we can be called husband and
[30:10] wife, but it goes deeper than that.
[30:13] That's right.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Because I can just we can just sit here
[30:16] and I can just tell you you know Bernham
[30:19] say Bernham say I have that knowledge
[30:22] but it's not about that because the
[30:26] purpose here is to show that it's not
[30:29] just a sermon but it's a way of life
[30:32] that he's expecting us to go all the way
[30:36] in.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And once you go all the way in,
[30:39] everything that I'll be speaking about
[30:42] us, it'll be so much clear, so much
[30:45] precise that I don't have to say it
[30:47] twice.
[30:49] So it is with the church. All this
[30:52] journey that we see that the children of
[30:55] Israel came along, it was not erected
[30:58] tent
[31:00] in order for people to see us.
[31:04] Of course, people will see the
[31:07] manifestations of sons and daughters of
[31:09] God, but that's not the point here. But
[31:12] he wants us in the holy of holies for a
[31:16] specific purpose.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Because church attendance is good.
[31:22] Supporting the cause is good. Paying our
[31:25] tithes and offerings is good. Confessing
[31:28] our sins and all that is good. But then
[31:31] brother Ram says, you see, just be a
[31:34] Christian.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Just live a good life.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; But then this year, God will give it to
[31:40] you if it's yours. What is that that
[31:43] that God has to give to you if he wants
[31:47] to?
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Because Peter looked at Jesus and said,
[31:51] "What about John? What about him?
[31:54] &gt;&gt; What is that unto you?"
[31:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; What did he say next? Follow thou me.
[32:00] Amen.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; It's not a public show anymore.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; When we put our dresses and our uh h
[32:09] shirts and suits and stuff, that's a
[32:12] public display.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; That's our first pool, our second pool.
[32:16] Oh, he thinks right. He's very polite
[32:19] and all these things here. People can
[32:21] see that. But then when it goes beyond
[32:24] there,
[32:25] &gt;&gt; that three-fold mystery of that seven
[32:28] seal, it can be a public thing.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Even to the one next to you
[32:36] because even Mida asked him and said,
[32:39] "What about
[32:41] when we get there? How is it going to be
[32:43] like? Are you going to have hope on me?"
[32:48] He came to him and said, "Hey, do you
[32:51] know these uh seven uh trumpets? God has
[32:55] given them to me. I have to get a 10 to
[32:58] get the people there." God said, "No,
[32:59] no, no, no. It's not profitable for the
[33:01] church."
[33:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Why was God keeping all these things
[33:07] secret?
[33:09] Why was the prophet standing there and
[33:12] goes to the motel and tells the brother
[33:14] and say like you know hey cut this
[33:16] section and I'm going to make another
[33:18] recording and he tells the people and
[33:20] say hey you know what I heard it oh no I
[33:24] didn't hear I saw it oh no actually just
[33:26] leave your Christian life
[33:33] come to Esther and tell her hey it's
[33:37] this time or nothing.
[33:42] All the public display that Esther was
[33:44] doing, going and putting and being
[33:47] natural and all these thing, not cutting
[33:49] the hair and all these things, that time
[33:52] was over.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; That time was over
[33:58] because this tabernacle that we are
[34:01] building is not a tabernacle made out of
[34:05] man's hand. Amen.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Because a man's hand will tell you, "Put
[34:10] the shirt, put the tie, you need to cut
[34:13] your hair this way because we don't want
[34:15] people to look like this and all these
[34:17] things." Yeah. On under that ministry,
[34:20] it is correct.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Under that anointing, it is correct
[34:26] &gt;&gt; because it is a partial revelation that
[34:28] you received.
[34:31] But then once under the full
[34:34] manifestation comes into view, it is a
[34:37] whole different thing.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; Because this seven seal mystery started
[34:44] at the time of the burning of the fig
[34:47] tree.
[34:48] But it didn't begin with the full
[34:51] revelation.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; It begins with a partial revelation. I
[34:56] said, "Hey, I'll give you the first
[34:58] gift. If thou be sincere, then you'll
[35:01] have the next one."
[35:04] Then he gets the second one.
[35:07] Then afterward,
[35:09] I'll give you more, but hang on tight.
[35:12] He said, "Sir, I'll receive more.
[35:15] I can wait for that."
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Then everybody's like, "Hey, can't we
[35:21] have you here's a check a,500
[35:26] All kind of distractions start coming
[35:27] in. That's right.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, you know you can have this year. You
[35:31] know you can have this year. He said,
[35:33] "No, no, no, no, no. That's not a
[35:34] purpose where I'm called on to."
[35:38] He was on a certain journey.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Then when we look back in our lives, we
[35:45] have to be sure of our journey.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; If we are B, brother Metan, where where
[35:52] do you come from? I don't know.
[35:55] Where you going? I don't know. What do
[35:58] you have scheduled up? I don't know. Why
[36:01] are you coming to church? Well, that
[36:03] that comes to church. He told me to come
[36:05] to church.
[36:08] Where you come from? Oh, I believe if I
[36:10] go to ancestry.com, I'll be able to
[36:13] retrace my ancestry. But that will only
[36:16] get you so far on your earthly journey.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:21] But then the where you started in the
[36:23] heavenly journey no ancestry no books no
[36:28] record will be able to give it to you.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; But instead this earthly journey will
[36:33] just be as much confusing splitting as
[36:36] we have seen under Nimrod
[36:38] &gt;&gt; because Nimrod religion will come and
[36:40] give you a new definition of yourself
[36:44] &gt;&gt; and under that teaching of Nimrod is a
[36:47] divide and conquer.
[36:50] And after conquering you under that
[36:52] confusion, then you become the false
[36:55] prophet under that anointing.
[36:59] But it is not the same as you are under
[37:02] the seventh seal anointing.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we started on last Sunday, the
[37:08] the Sunday we started uh we saw that uh
[37:12] we talk a little bit about the four uh
[37:15] the five requirements to receive the
[37:17] revelation but we I was unable to finish
[37:19] it as the word as it opens up the more
[37:23] you go and the more you start realizing
[37:26] certain things you say you can just
[37:28] finish it up.
[37:30] Then
[37:32] he brought me back to something that was
[37:36] happening in the church while I was
[37:38] preaching.
[37:40] And I said on that service, I said,
[37:42] "Bear with me." As I'm taking my time to
[37:46] get up there.
[37:48] I didn't understand why I said it
[37:50] myself.
[37:52] Then I went back. I said, "Oh, it makes
[37:54] sense.
[37:56] different anointing that we are
[37:59] preaching with
[38:01] leads things in a certain manner.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; At times he's conscious of his children
[38:10] that certain things need to be broken
[38:13] down slowly so there's no confusion in
[38:16] the church.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sure.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; But then now
[38:23] this afternoon
[38:25] you can see how happy I am
[38:29] that
[38:31] I say yes.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; I can't explain this.
[38:37] It is so important to each one of us.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Not to stay in the outer courts.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Let's go in.
[38:47] I beseech us
[38:52] &gt;&gt; that once you take this message for
[38:54] yourself, not for the church gathering
[38:57] and you spend time with it,
[39:00] &gt;&gt; you're going to experience those
[39:02] anointing.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; In music,
[39:08] &gt;&gt; in prayer, in preaching,
[39:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Church is one thing. Burnham say says
[39:17] you see like Mary Mary was just standing
[39:21] there.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; She was just a place like this one where
[39:26] people come and ged to but church is not
[39:29] the thing
[39:30] &gt;&gt; but it is the Christ.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; And see along our life journey
[39:39] he comes and gives us a little bit more
[39:41] today
[39:42] &gt;&gt; a little bit more tomorrow. a little bit
[39:45] more again.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; And then when you come and you get into
[39:50] that full restoration,
[39:53] it can only be a shalom.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; When you look back and you see that
[39:59] journey and say, "I've walked this walk.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Was that really me?
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Was this me who left this?
[40:10] Was this me who was struggling with this
[40:13] high heels and tie skirts?
[40:17] Oh, what a shalom.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; What a place of rest.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; I was out there sneaking around and
[40:26] playing with men, playing with women
[40:28] without anybody seeing me, not unable to
[40:31] live freely.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Then I made the decision.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I have decided
[40:39] &gt;&gt; to follow Jesus.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; The world behind me, the cross before
[40:45] me.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; And then when you get to that cross,
[40:48] then you said, "Oh,
[40:50] there's a cleansing flow."
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Flowing from Emmanuel's vein
[40:56] &gt;&gt; and it's flowing
[40:58] daily. Then you say, "Thank you for the
[41:01] cross."
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the work you've done.
[41:05] Then he tells you, "Come, I'll show you
[41:08] more." Amen.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Come, I'll show you more.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Then the next fellow wants to understand
[41:14] why you so happy.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Explain it to me.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Make it a good sermon
[41:24] as a nay introductions, development,
[41:29] and make make it plain to me. I can't.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; It is a forbidden language.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; But I can show you the way.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the way.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; He will take you through.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; He is the shalom.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; And once he get you there, you'll come
[41:49] out.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; And you'll be just as happy.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; And this shalom is not a public show.
[41:57] Amen.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Even though human flesh can only express
[42:02] the happiness, but it's not enough to
[42:05] express it.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; You can be as happy because as happy you
[42:12] can be running on the street. A drunk
[42:14] man can also be as happy as you are.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; That's what the manifestation in the
[42:19] articles. Amen.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; As eloquent I can be or you can be or
[42:25] how you can write and they say about it,
[42:27] he will never get it.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; The prophet tried.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; But he said, you see, just be a
[42:36] Christian.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[42:41] And I sit there. I'm looking. I said,
[42:44] wow,
[42:45] these things are so real.
[42:49] Then I looked at the next service.
[42:52] He says he preaches the world is falling
[42:56] apart.
[42:59] You just revealed something here and the
[43:03] world is falling apart.
[43:05] Intellectually
[43:07] &gt;&gt; it's a contradiction.
[43:09] Right?
[43:10] &gt;&gt; You can have a shalom
[43:12] and then the world start falling apart
[43:15] &gt;&gt; because when you come they told us in
[43:17] church it is a time of peace
[43:21] that's where the separation start coming
[43:23] into view
[43:25] &gt;&gt; to whom the word of the lord has been
[43:28] revealed who has believed our report.
[43:34] I beseech us tonight not to listen to me
[43:38] intellectually.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; It won't work.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; But open the inner man
[43:45] &gt;&gt; to receive it.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; And at the appointed time, you'll be
[43:50] able to say, "Oh, this is my journey."
[43:54] &gt;&gt; This is exactly what I'm saying in my
[43:57] life at this time. I'm not confused at
[43:59] all.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm my my life is so clear before
[44:04] my path I said that few weeks I was
[44:07] wondering
[44:09] &gt;&gt; what is happening
[44:12] why am I going through this
[44:14] why is this here then you had to come
[44:17] and take the word and open the word
[44:20] &gt;&gt; amen
[44:22] &gt;&gt; wouldn't be a wonderful thing that when
[44:25] we sit with each one of us in fellowship
[44:29] you said Brother, I know what it is for
[44:33] me.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Y
[44:36] &gt;&gt; William Brham says, "I sit there in the
[44:39] room and I saw it. I heard it."
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Because right now everybody's listening,
[44:47] but can any of everybody see it?
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Can everybody hear it?
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Because all of us will say, "Brother,
[44:57] are you the tabernacle of the Lord?"
[44:59] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The Bible say I
[45:00] am the temple of God. Everybody will say
[45:03] it. Sister, are you the temple? Yeah.
[45:05] Yeah. Yeah. I have all my virtues all in
[45:08] place. I am came into marriage according
[45:11] to the word and everything.
[45:15] Did the cloud come down?
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; I am the wisest man, you know. I am I
[45:22] have a good reputation in town. King
[45:24] Solomon. Everybody's in peace with me
[45:27] according to the word. building the
[45:29] tabernacle.
[45:31] Solomon, did the cloud come down?
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; And that answer you can fool it.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; You can come and say, well, you know, I
[45:43] am baptized with the Holy Ghost. You
[45:44] know, you know, in this day, this is the
[45:47] hour. This is my experience. It's a
[45:49] whole different thing.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; It's a whole different journey. and hear
[45:57] the Lord. And now he's showing us
[46:00] &gt;&gt; by his grace to say, well, it will
[46:03] require the ability to hear from God.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; It will require a requirement. It's not
[46:13] maybe I will have it, maybe I won't have
[46:15] it. It is a must.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Let me push a little bit forward. Cain
[46:22] heard from God.
[46:24] Right.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Pain heard from God
[46:30] &gt;&gt; and God told him do like your brother.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; But it's not that kind of hearing.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Because when you only hear with this
[46:38] natural here, you're going to miss it.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is my position. Oh, this is
[46:44] what I know. This is what brother Bam
[46:46] say, black and white. But you're still
[46:48] missing it.
[46:51] How come you're standing in the presence
[46:53] of God? God is talking to you and you
[46:55] can't hear it.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to jump a little bit here.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham speaks here in the message
[47:09] exposition of the seven church ages
[47:12] smearing church age. It says to further
[47:15] bring out what we've just said and to
[47:18] also use the scripture that should be
[47:21] born in mind as we talk about who it is
[47:25] that is baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[47:27] See what Jesus said in John 6:46 uh
[47:30] 6:45. It is written in the prophet and
[47:34] they shall all
[47:36] be taught of God. But turn into Isaiah
[47:40] 54:13.
[47:42] Hence this uh this is taken and and it
[47:46] reads and all children shall be taught
[47:49] of the Lord and all of God are the
[47:53] children of God. Thus it thus it is that
[47:58] the evidence of of being a true child of
[48:02] God in whom the spirit has come upon and
[48:06] indwells
[48:08] is again set forth as one taught the
[48:12] word by the ho by the holy ghost.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. being taught
[48:19] individually
[48:21] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Where has thy strengthen gone? Samson
[48:26] paragraph 43. Now I think that's just
[48:30] the way a lot of our seminary teaching
[48:33] and knowledge does too much of canary
[48:36] brain.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Canary.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; We go about knowledge in the head,
[48:42] knowledge in the head, knowledge in the
[48:43] head, and we miss it.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh brother, if you just believe
[48:48] the message of the hour, you got it,
[48:49] brother.
[48:52] Brother, you need to be there in church
[48:54] to prove that the Holy Ghost is in you.
[48:56] You have to come in church. That's true,
[48:58] brother. But that too much of cannorary
[49:02] brain.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Intellectual teaching in other word.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; But we don't want that.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; We don't desire that.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[49:15] We can't understand the mysteries of God
[49:18] by knowledge
[49:20] &gt;&gt; because it's only revealed by the Holy
[49:23] Ghost as it will reveal.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; The mystery is here in the is the
[49:30] mystery here. It is the mystery. A
[49:34] mystery is a scripture. We go on to the
[49:37] next scripture, brother.
[49:40] Is the previously hidden truth now
[49:43] divinely revealed. Right. Right.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Of course we speak about the outer court
[49:50] and holy place. Yes. That is known of
[49:55] all
[49:56] can be impersonated by all.
[50:01] But that mystery
[50:03] I'm not just talking about the mystery
[50:06] that we can read about in the in the
[50:09] message
[50:10] because we just read in the Bible. He
[50:13] says that the children of Israel went
[50:16] each one in the journeys plural.
[50:22] Otherwise,
[50:23] oh brother, this is the mystery of God,
[50:25] the message of the hour. Yes, that's
[50:27] true. The Catholic Church today have the
[50:31] message on record.
[50:33] They study it day and night. They know
[50:37] exactly how to present it.
[50:41] They can even they are even better in
[50:44] explaining the message of William
[50:45] Brennham.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; But then the mystery of God it is a
[50:53] scripture that was once hidden
[50:57] divinely revealed.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; And that revelation
[51:03] is not a public show.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a me of me coming and
[51:08] explaining it to the church.
[51:11] Oh, you are the bride. Everybody can say
[51:13] that.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; The foolish virgin could say so.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; They had oil in the lamps.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; And having oil in the lamps is not
[51:25] enough.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:30] The greater the mystery a uh divinely
[51:33] revealed but which is a supernatural
[51:36] element still remain
[51:39] despite the revelation.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; We read the message of the hour. We have
[51:45] all this wonderful revelation. Despite
[51:47] that revelation,
[51:49] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Something still mysterious still
[51:52] attached to it.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. But yeah, but say like you know the
[51:57] word is revealed. Yes.
[52:02] Then what is that element that is
[52:05] attached to it?
[52:08] It is a special thing.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; And then when it comes to us,
[52:13] you say, "Yes,
[52:15] &gt;&gt; it makes sense."
[52:17] &gt;&gt; I know
[52:20] the church can be as humble as it can
[52:24] be, as simple as it can be. But I'm
[52:28] pointing us to that element
[52:32] that it's not a shouting mother,
[52:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:36] &gt;&gt; It's not a lot of amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; But it is a thing of brother, get in
[52:42] there.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, brother. I've read the message.
[52:48] I know this here. I listen to the tape
[52:50] every day. I know.
[52:53] But I'm calling us to that place. Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; When nobody has ever been before but
[52:59] only you alone.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; And once you get to that place, it is a
[53:05] different talk. The message becomes a
[53:08] whole different message.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Burnham lists all kind of mystery. The
[53:15] mystery of godliness, the uh the mystery
[53:19] of uh iniquities and all these things
[53:21] here. We can all read about it.
[53:25] My message is going to be very short,
[53:28] but God's grace, God willing, but this
[53:30] place of shalom.
[53:32] Oh, paragraph 259 of the same message.
[53:37] No such a thing as an eternal burning
[53:39] hell. You'll burn millions for years.
[53:41] But anything that was eternal
[53:45] had never had a beginning or an end.
[53:47] That's
[53:48] &gt;&gt; right.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; And hell was created.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. All these mysteries.
[53:54] Amen.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; The mysteries of the baptism of the Holy
[53:58] Ghost without sensation, we we we saw
[54:00] it. But the person, listen to this, but
[54:04] the person of Christ performing in you
[54:07] the same work that he did.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; What is that work?
[54:16] What is that work,
[54:20] brother? I'm a preacher. Yeah. Yeah.
[54:22] Yeah. We know. But what is that work?
[54:26] Each one of us I like that calm quiet in
[54:30] the church.
[54:32] What is that work?
[54:34] &gt;&gt; God in you.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, he's in us. We know
[54:41] what is that work
[54:43] because William Brham when if you are a
[54:46] good tape listener or good student of
[54:49] the message you can see brother Brham
[54:51] along the ages along his life he
[54:55] preaches one thing here another one here
[54:57] then one here he's struggling with this
[55:01] year he comes oh you know obedience is
[55:04] better than sacrifice yesterday I was
[55:06] supposed to preach on a uh Sir, what?
[55:09] Um, uh, watchman, what is of the night?
[55:12] But I didn't. Ah, I'm sorry, Lord.
[55:15] Yeah. Longong along his life journey.
[55:20] But then when he comes to him and tells
[55:22] him,
[55:24] I'll meet you in there. He says, I'm
[55:27] standing here. This is 1956. He say, I'm
[55:30] standing here. The thing that he told me
[55:34] until I go in the grave, I'll never say
[55:37] it.
[55:40] I'm not talking just about church
[55:42] attendance.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about, oh, I'm I'm a
[55:46] preacher only this year. Go and verify
[55:49] it.
[55:51] You say, I'm standing here. Until then,
[55:54] I'll never say it.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Each one of us, we need to get to that
[56:01] point. Amen.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; And as I am talking, I'm wrapping this.
[56:07] It's we building the tabernacle.
[56:12] We know all these things here. But then
[56:15] now comes the place where about we just
[56:19] read in the Bible. Moses was unable
[56:23] to get into the tabernacle because the
[56:26] cloud was there.
[56:29] I shouldn't be able to walk into that
[56:32] place
[56:33] because he has taken over
[56:38] &gt;&gt; because all the elders stood outside
[56:41] while Ruth and Boaz
[56:45] went inside.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; What was happening in there?
[56:50] &gt;&gt; What kind of conversation takes place?
[56:55] What are we looking for in this hour?
[57:00] All of us are message believers by the
[57:03] by the face value.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; It will require supernatural
[57:17] instruction.
[57:19] Not just a student comparing verse with
[57:22] verse.
[57:23] Barabam says though that is good
[57:28] but a mystery.
[57:31] Next uh part please
[57:34] so at least people can have the
[57:36] reference.
[57:40] Next.
[57:43] Next.
[57:52] Seems like you don't have it.
[57:53] Nevertheless, it will require
[57:56] supernatural instructions. Not just a
[57:58] student comparing verse with verse,
[58:01] though that is good. Listen to brother
[58:02] Brandham. I'm reading from a church age
[58:05] book. But a mystery requires the
[58:08] teaching of the spirit
[58:10] or it never becomes clear.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; You first have to hear from him and he
[58:20] has to instruct it.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Otherwise it will never be clear.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; This is the issue that we have in the
[58:30] message church today.
[58:33] You come and you listen to a sermon, you
[58:37] go out so confused that you do you get
[58:40] upset with the minister.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; And once you get upset with the
[58:47] minister, the next time he's preaching,
[58:50] you're not excited to hear it.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; And that's why I understand. That's why
[58:58] I said it made sense to me.
[59:04] that it requires him to come and teach
[59:07] us.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; And if we still at the level of I when I
[59:13] pray, I didn't hear God talk to me and I
[59:17] think I'll just do what things good to
[59:19] me.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; We are in trouble.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Because the next time he will come and
[59:26] talk to you,
[59:28] &gt;&gt; he'll be so confused
[59:31] &gt;&gt; on why should you do that when it seems
[59:33] so right to any human mind to do this.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Otherwise it will never come become
[59:43] clear and once it becomes clear
[59:47] say you become a notball.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir. You become misunderstood
[59:54] by the world.
[59:57] Brother Brham, he said, "Dad," Billy
[59:59] Paul said, "Dad, you're doing wrong.
[1:00:04] You can't leave the missionary work." He
[1:00:06] said, "No, I didn't promise him that.
[1:00:12] If he's the one that that with back
[1:00:14] there and whatever all the experiences
[1:00:18] that I'm experiencing along my life
[1:00:20] journey, I can't go back there. You say
[1:00:24] I'll go meet banks and do what I can do
[1:00:27] and provide for my family and all these
[1:00:32] things here.
[1:00:34] Then he comes to him. He say by this
[1:00:37] you'll know when you go to Mexico you'll
[1:00:41] see this here you will see those dead
[1:00:43] fishes.
[1:00:44] Nobody knew about it.
[1:00:47] Billy Paul couldn't understand why was
[1:00:50] that leaving the work
[1:00:53] and go back there.
[1:00:55] It seems reasonable to serve the Lord,
[1:00:59] right?
[1:01:02] It seems so reasonable to come to church
[1:01:05] every day.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; It seems so reasonable
[1:01:10] to human mind to Mida and to Billy Paul
[1:01:15] that you can do that
[1:01:17] you can't leave God's work and to go
[1:01:20] find a job.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; That's human mind.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Brother, the brother left the church.
[1:01:28] Oh, this is this year. And he does to
[1:01:31] human mind. Yes.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; But then once you get into that
[1:01:37] relationship,
[1:01:39] he will take you into places that even
[1:01:42] yourself wouldn't make sense.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; That's what I said that to myself too.
[1:01:48] It was so
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; it's not just a sermon. It it is such a
[1:01:55] pain to be found in certain position in
[1:01:58] life.
[1:02:00] I was in Colorado. The Lord comes and
[1:02:02] tells me, "You need to go." I say,
[1:02:04] "What's happening?"
[1:02:08] I'm serving you. I'm doing this here. I
[1:02:10] have the Sundays. I have the young
[1:02:11] people. I have the media. I'm the
[1:02:13] trustee. I'm I'm the interpreter. I'm
[1:02:16] preaching. I'm serving you.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; What do you mean to go? Go where? Why?
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Tell me. Make make it understandable.
[1:02:30] He comes again. You must go.
[1:02:34] Nah, I don't believe this. I don't see
[1:02:38] any scripture that anybody will just
[1:02:42] leave the church to go somewhere without
[1:02:45] any understanding of who shall follow
[1:02:48] him.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Then the Lord had to go and find a
[1:02:53] sister in France that I never seen. call
[1:02:57] that man, tell him this, this, this.
[1:03:01] Then when she comes and tells me, if she
[1:03:03] ever walks in the room, I'll never know
[1:03:05] it's her until she presents herself. She
[1:03:08] said, "Brother, I saw you. I came. I
[1:03:12] wanted to greet you, but you left. You
[1:03:14] started going this way. You were with
[1:03:16] such a people." I said, "I don't know
[1:03:19] anybody of that form
[1:03:22] until I get to Arizona.
[1:03:25] Then I find myself say the sister so
[1:03:28] right.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Then I find myself in Mexico.
[1:03:35] It's like the Lord saw me before then.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; But to my human mind,
[1:03:42] it couldn't make sense
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; without that vision.
[1:03:50] Then I said, "Lord, forgive me.
[1:03:54] You're bringing me this life journey. I
[1:03:56] think that my life is limited to a
[1:03:58] church
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; to a certain association.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; But he wants you to go places that you
[1:04:08] never seen before.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; That's why we read that when the cloud
[1:04:13] lifted up and went, the children of
[1:04:16] Israel went also. Amen.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Everyone in the journey,
[1:04:25] it's not a public show.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; One of the minister told me, "Brother,
[1:04:31] if it doesn't work out where you go,
[1:04:33] just come back."
[1:04:37] I said, "Brother, I hope so."
[1:04:41] And it's been three years. I haven't
[1:04:44] went back.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:48] And that's how the Lord and I'm giving
[1:04:50] this example so it can be a little bit
[1:04:53] more clear that this seven seal
[1:04:56] revelation is not a collective thing.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; It's not to be understood by all. It's
[1:05:04] not to be understood by yourself. is not
[1:05:06] to be clear in your mind because our
[1:05:11] canary brain
[1:05:13] in our seminary told us you assign
[1:05:17] yourself to this group of people
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; and that's what Nimro did.
[1:05:29] We when we if we you can if you can
[1:05:32] remember when we read in Branham in the
[1:05:36] what house will thou build me
[1:05:39] prior to those years he said every time
[1:05:43] the Lord give gives me any new sermon
[1:05:46] I'll come back to the tabernacle to
[1:05:48] preach it
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; right
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; but then when he preaches what house
[1:05:53] will thou build me what does he say he
[1:05:55] said here I am with brother perigrine in
[1:06:00] standing up the church. I don't have to
[1:06:03] go back to Jeffersonville anymore and I
[1:06:05] can do it from here.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; That seven seal goes beyond human
[1:06:12] understanding.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; We can be in this life journey going
[1:06:18] left and right and thinking like you
[1:06:20] know this is my career life and this is
[1:06:23] what I'm planning to do. This is how I'm
[1:06:25] going to do it. This is first step,
[1:06:28] second step. Then he comes and tells you
[1:06:30] scrap all that. Go this way.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; What do you mean go this way?
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; I spend time in research and
[1:06:38] development. I should live this year. I
[1:06:41] can testify. I've been through it
[1:06:46] all my life. Burnham says mida calls me
[1:06:51] a restless wind.
[1:06:53] Today I'm here. I can't sit. Then he
[1:06:56] say, "Oh," he says, "I am homesick.
[1:06:59] I'm tired. I want to go home." But then
[1:07:02] where is home?
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "But look at all the place
[1:07:06] where I grew up at. All the houses been
[1:07:09] broken down and they have all this type
[1:07:11] of development here. We have no
[1:07:13] continuing city."
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:18] And for that to become clear in this
[1:07:21] journey of ours
[1:07:24] when we want to associate ourself with
[1:07:26] the rest of the group I got you my
[1:07:29] friend you know we have to stick
[1:07:30] together you know let's go all together
[1:07:32] they was like you know leave your wife
[1:07:35] leave your children go sit down there
[1:07:39] you need to spend some time with me
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; and the wife here what kind of husband
[1:07:44] are you I didn't sign up for is
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; those stages of your life it is tough.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; That's why the mystery
[1:08:01] requires a teaching of the spirit
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; or otherwise he will never become clear.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; I want to understand my brother. What's
[1:08:13] your name? Where you come from? What's
[1:08:15] your death father? What's your
[1:08:16] background? What's your interest? It's
[1:08:18] like oh this is what it looks like. Oh
[1:08:21] this I know if I go back to him he's the
[1:08:23] one who can help me. But then when the
[1:08:26] angel of the Lord comes to him and say
[1:08:28] leave all that demeanor leave all that
[1:08:30] smile keep your face face there. Go in
[1:08:33] there don't greet anybody. Go there
[1:08:35] until I speak to you. Then the person
[1:08:37] comes like what is wrong with this
[1:08:40] brother? The brother's backs alive. He
[1:08:42] has lost the the joy of the salvation.
[1:08:45] Are you a secret sinner?
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; All these here are examples in the
[1:08:50] Bibles that we are aware of
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; that the Lord is bringing us one step
[1:08:57] above the other into that great shalom
[1:09:01] that that restoration of that channel of
[1:09:04] communication that nobody can decrypt.
[1:09:07] Yeah.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Nobody can understand why it has to be
[1:09:11] so.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Why it has to be you to go through all
[1:09:15] that journey?
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Each one of us
[1:09:24] to look back in that journey
[1:09:27] and say, "I've come so far
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; with what I called my experience.
[1:09:32] Lord, then what next?
[1:09:40] Oh my.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; We see Manoak wife. Judges 13:3-5.
[1:09:47] And the angel of the Lord appear unto
[1:09:49] the woman, and said unto her, Behold,
[1:09:52] now thou are barren, and beest not, but
[1:09:55] thou shalt conceive and bear a son. Now
[1:09:57] therefore be aware, I pray thee, and
[1:10:00] drink not wine, and not no strong drink,
[1:10:03] and eat not any unclean thing. For lo,
[1:10:06] thou shalt conceive and bear a son, and
[1:10:09] no resor shall come on his head, for the
[1:10:13] child shall be a Nazarite unto God from
[1:10:15] the womb, and he shall begin to deliver
[1:10:17] Israel out of the hands of the
[1:10:19] Philistines.
[1:10:21] The next fellow is criticizing her. She
[1:10:25] can't bear a son.
[1:10:27] She can conceive
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; instructions, direct instructions.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Matthew 13. And he answered unto them,
[1:10:38] because it is given unto you to know the
[1:10:40] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but
[1:10:43] to them it is not given. For whosoever
[1:10:45] have to him shall be given, and he shall
[1:10:48] have more abundance, but whosoever have
[1:10:52] not, from him shall be taken away, even
[1:10:56] he that he hath. Therefore, I say, speak
[1:10:59] I to them in parables, because they
[1:11:02] seeing, seeing not, see not, and hearing
[1:11:06] they hear not, neither do they
[1:11:09] understand.
[1:11:11] And in them is and and in them is
[1:11:15] fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which
[1:11:18] say by hearing you shall hear and shall
[1:11:21] not understand.
[1:11:27] Each one of us
[1:11:30] have you ever been in that place
[1:11:33] when the message doesn't make sense to
[1:11:35] you yet?
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; It's at that place. That's right. That's
[1:11:40] true.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; You're only hearing a quotation being
[1:11:44] plugged here,
[1:11:46] an example of stuff being plugged here,
[1:11:49] and it doesn't make any sense.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; And this is what now the prophet go
[1:11:54] Jesus is telling them. Verse 15. For
[1:11:58] these people heart uh heart is a works
[1:12:01] gross and their ears are dull of hearing
[1:12:04] and their eyes have no have um eyes have
[1:12:08] they have closed lest at any time they
[1:12:13] should see with their eyes and hear with
[1:12:15] their ears and should understand with
[1:12:17] their heart and should be converted and
[1:12:21] I shall heal them. Verse 16.
[1:12:27] But blessed are your eyes,
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; for they see, and your ears, for they
[1:12:34] hear.
[1:12:35] For verily I say unto you, that many
[1:12:38] prophets,
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; and righteous men
[1:12:45] have desired.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Imagine that.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Have desired.
[1:12:55] Daniel said, "When will be the
[1:12:56] fulfillment of these things?" Close it,
[1:12:59] Daniel. It's not for your time.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:04] Lord, give me revelation of this,
[1:13:05] revelation of that. It tells you, wait,
[1:13:09] think about it.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Abraham, I need a son. I need a son. 25
[1:13:13] years.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; What is your journey?
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; See each person.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; And for I understand that we have elders
[1:13:29] here. they can understand it better.
[1:13:33] When you elder sit there and you listen
[1:13:36] to somebody preach, you can quickly tell
[1:13:39] where he's at in the word.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Yet, there's still also another person
[1:13:45] in the church who doesn't understand
[1:13:48] what that person is teaching.
[1:13:53] So therefore you understand that each
[1:13:55] one of us in our journey we are called
[1:13:59] to press harder
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; to go deeper.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Lord give me that revelation
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; if I can go quickly to try to see if I
[1:14:09] can do if I can get to it.
[1:14:15] have desired to see those things which
[1:14:17] he see and have not seen them and to
[1:14:20] hear those things which he hear and have
[1:14:23] not heard them.
[1:14:25] Revelations um revelation of Jesus
[1:14:27] Christ church book. Now you might take
[1:14:30] what the pastor says or what the
[1:14:33] missionary um seminary teachings and
[1:14:36] though it might be talk to you with
[1:14:38] eloquence
[1:14:40] until God reveals to you that Jesus is
[1:14:44] the Christ and that is the blood that
[1:14:47] cleans you and that God is your savior,
[1:14:51] you will never have eternal life. It is
[1:14:54] a spiritual revelation that does it.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Regardless of all the noise that I'm
[1:15:03] making here, let me call it noise.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; All this that I'm making here, clear,
[1:15:09] unclear, confusing, not confusing, very
[1:15:12] straightforward.
[1:15:14] If the spirit doesn't come down,
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; And reveal it, it will never become
[1:15:21] clear.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:23] Otherwise, it's just another reference
[1:15:26] quotation that be projected on the
[1:15:28] board.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; But that's not it.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Then when the spirit comes, it is so
[1:15:36] specific
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; because the tabernacle has been erected
[1:15:41] and the cloud has come down and now he's
[1:15:44] the one giving direct instructions.
[1:15:49] Amen.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; These direct instructions is not a
[1:15:54] public show.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Samaran church age. Notice that Jesus
[1:16:04] here that Jesus by the spirit
[1:16:07] in every age addressed himself to only
[1:16:11] one person relative to the word for that
[1:16:14] age.
[1:16:18] God will speak to you and you alone
[1:16:22] regarding what is to you in what you
[1:16:26] have to do.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Agewise, the prophet comes and gives us
[1:16:33] the message of the hour. Sure.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Agewise.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Then now,
[1:16:40] Ruth,
[1:16:42] Esther,
[1:16:44] Gideon,
[1:16:46] Joshua,
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; angelic visitation for the work. They
[1:16:52] are not
[1:16:54] major prophets.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; But here now, it is specific to the
[1:17:00] person.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:04] And now when we get to that level, the
[1:17:08] message becomes a whole different book.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; The message can be a reference point.
[1:17:15] Brother Abraham says as much as we want,
[1:17:18] very eloquently spoken and good English,
[1:17:22] bad English, good accent, bad accent,
[1:17:25] all that you want to give to it. But
[1:17:28] until then, the message will never
[1:17:32] become clear. Amen.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Because when we go to a market,
[1:17:38] we find all sizes of shoes and shirts
[1:17:41] and stuff, but you take only what is
[1:17:45] specific fit for you.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; It's not that the rest of the shirts are
[1:17:52] not important,
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; right? Very good.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; But this shirt here is the one that I
[1:17:58] need. Amen.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; And you take that shirt and that dress
[1:18:05] for a specific purpose.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Let me bring it there.
[1:18:12] You have a shirt to sleep with. You have
[1:18:15] a shirt to work with. You have a shirt
[1:18:18] to party with. You have a shirt for some
[1:18:22] high-profile meeting.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; It is still you.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Very good. Right. in different stages.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; I've received the Holy Ghost. It's good,
[1:18:35] but it's not enough.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; But they told us to receive the Yes.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Get in there.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; We saw William Brham receiving the Holy
[1:18:50] Ghost, right?
[1:18:52] Brother Brandham received the Holy Ghost
[1:18:53] and went and said, "Mama, something
[1:18:55] happened to me. I'm a different being."
[1:18:58] Yes,
[1:18:59] but I'll meet you in there.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; I heard it. I saw it. And then the
[1:19:07] revelation.
[1:19:09] I'm hearing it. I know exactly what is
[1:19:13] happening in my life.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Why is it happening? For this purpose?
[1:19:19] Because I preach this. Because as we
[1:19:22] listen to this sermon, this anointing
[1:19:24] under this type of sermons in this type
[1:19:26] of places that Barabburn was going, it
[1:19:29] requires this type of anointing
[1:19:33] that only becomes clear when you sit at
[1:19:36] the feet of the prophet. Lord, why was
[1:19:40] Barana preaching this?
[1:19:43] Why didn't he preach this here? He left
[1:19:46] this meeting going to this meeting. What
[1:19:49] is happening there?
[1:19:53] Oh, thank you, Lord, for the message.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; It's just not a slogan, my brothers.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; It's not just a church attendance.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; It's not just coming here and hearing
[1:20:05] another good sermon.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; It's so far beyond that.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; It's so far beyond that. Even my words
[1:20:14] will not be able to express enough
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; all this life journey that I've lived so
[1:20:21] far. I said, "Lord, you've given me the
[1:20:24] grace
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; to identify these things."
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; I remember those days I was sitting
[1:20:32] there. I'll never forget it.
[1:20:36] A minister came to Congo. I don't know
[1:20:38] if I can recall if it's brother Edis or
[1:20:41] one of the brothers.
[1:20:43] And he started preaching the high priest
[1:20:45] going into the temple, going into the
[1:20:47] holy of holies and and then he's the
[1:20:50] same one coming out. I'm sitting there.
[1:20:53] What does it mean? You mean barrenom
[1:20:56] going up, coming back down.
[1:21:00] So the high priest, is it the one?
[1:21:04] What's going on here?
[1:21:06] God didn't just come and oh my child
[1:21:09] because you are my child and let me
[1:21:11] explain it to you. No, I sweat it out.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; I had to sit down one message after the
[1:21:18] other looking deep into it after
[1:21:21] studying going into prayer.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Then when it pleased him, he came down
[1:21:30] and said, "Oh,
[1:21:35] that's why we have all these doctrines
[1:21:38] of worshiping the prophet. The
[1:21:41] revelation has come. The revelation has
[1:21:44] not come.
[1:21:47] So all these debates of doctrines and
[1:21:49] stuff, it's because it's not a public
[1:21:52] thing. That's right.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; It requires to go down there and even
[1:21:57] yourself, you can't say it.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; That's why he kept it secret. Oh, that's
[1:22:02] why even the prophet himself kept it
[1:22:05] shut.
[1:22:06] It was because of this.
[1:22:10] It goes beyond human understanding.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, it does.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry I couldn't get to all the
[1:22:16] quotes, but by God's grace, he get I'm
[1:22:21] seeing all this here. Christ coming down
[1:22:24] and let me just read um
[1:22:30] just one quotation the seven seal then
[1:22:32] we'll close. And by God's grace and
[1:22:35] uh
[1:22:38] before I read this quotation,
[1:22:42] thank you so much brothers and sisters
[1:22:45] for all these opportunities that you
[1:22:48] always give me
[1:22:50] to stand here on the pulpit. I never
[1:22:52] take it lightly. Uh I might not be very
[1:22:57] eloquent. My way of preaching might not
[1:23:00] be very straight.
[1:23:02] because every time that I get here, I
[1:23:04] can prepare the sermon quickly. You take
[1:23:07] me different routes.
[1:23:09] So,
[1:23:12] God bless you so much.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Bless you, brother.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Uh God willing uh starting tomorrow,
[1:23:18] I'll be uh taking some new assignments.
[1:23:23] I don't know how long it will go for.
[1:23:26] Uh you'll see.
[1:23:30] I might not be around so often, but uh
[1:23:34] as the Lord allows that to happen, we'll
[1:23:38] meet in fellowship.
[1:23:40] As I said, it was heavy on me.
[1:23:44] Yeah, it was heavy on me. I said, "What
[1:23:48] is this life?
[1:23:50] You come and you do one thing and then
[1:23:52] you after another after another." But I
[1:23:55] pray that you remember me and my wife in
[1:23:58] prayer
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; for this uh journey ahead. She'll be
[1:24:02] around uh all the time.
[1:24:06] We have to do what we have to do is uh
[1:24:09] those chapter of our lives and that it
[1:24:14] doesn't always make sense
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; but when it comes down
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; that's why it's always clear.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:22] Barabam says here to close
[1:24:25] seven seal. Now we into the age of the
[1:24:30] eagle
[1:24:32] the revelation to be revealed
[1:24:36] the whole thing.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:39] the whole thing. He says, "Now, now
[1:24:43] compare this with Revelation 10, chapter
[1:24:48] 1, chapter, Revelation 10th chapter
[1:24:52] verse 1 to 10. You see the coming down
[1:24:54] of the angel, the coming down of the
[1:24:56] cloud."
[1:24:57] And uh you'll see here in this
[1:24:59] revelation and the revelation here
[1:25:03] revelation 10 1-7 that in the days of
[1:25:07] the sounding of the seventh angel
[1:25:09] message was to finish up all the
[1:25:13] mysteries of God.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Let that be for you.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Let's not just be church attenders.
[1:25:26] Let not be forgetful listeners,
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; wonderful ministers that I've seen
[1:25:34] around come on the pulpit, preach
[1:25:36] differently, deeper amens and all these
[1:25:39] things here. But until
[1:25:43] we get to that level,
[1:25:46] that angel talking to us directly about
[1:25:49] those things, the mystery will never
[1:25:52] come clear.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Shall we pray as the musician
[1:25:55] come? Precious heavenly father,
[1:26:00] I'm so grateful Lord to stand in your
[1:26:03] presence. Lord, I'm so happy this
[1:26:06] afternoon about thy word and seeing the
[1:26:09] anointing and
[1:26:12] your children standing there sitting
[1:26:14] there and listening. Father,
[1:26:16] I just hope Lord by no means Lord that
[1:26:19] try to be disrespectful by
[1:26:23] words, choices and all these things.
[1:26:26] Father, but do you believe, Father, that
[1:26:29] the same way that you did with the
[1:26:30] prophet, so shall you do with us.
[1:26:34] The prophet sweed it out, we have to
[1:26:37] come through the same way.
[1:26:39] Bless us, Lord.

[1:31:44] Lord, I want to see you.
[1:31:50] Yes, I want to see you.

[1:32:41] up to see you high and lifted up

[1:33:05] [Music]
[1:33:07] Lord. I want to see you.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, I want to see you.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just sing one more before we
[1:33:21] dismiss tonight. Just thinking about
[1:33:23] that song as he's preaching. Why should
[1:33:26] I worry? Why should I fear?
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Just that no matter what we're going
[1:33:31] through that God's got a plan. He's got
[1:33:34] it in control.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; We can have peace in that. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:38] Yes, sir.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, out on the waterers,
[1:33:43] storms raging high,
[1:33:46] the waters around them were troubled by
[1:33:51] night.
[1:33:53] Fear filled their hearts.
[1:33:56] They felt they would die.
[1:33:59] They failed to remember
[1:34:02] that the master was nine.
[1:34:06] And he spoke the word.
[1:34:09] And the winds all stood still.
[1:34:12] And even the waters
[1:34:15] they obeyed his will.
[1:34:19] He calmed their storms
[1:34:22] just like he will mine.
[1:34:25] I just remember
[1:34:28] that he lives deep inside.
[1:34:32] So why should I worry?
[1:34:35] Why should I fear
[1:34:38] when the very same Jesus
[1:34:41] saves always
[1:34:45] lives in my heart
[1:34:48] and hears when I cry
[1:34:51] on call on his name till the storm
[1:34:55] passes by.
[1:34:57] We're reading the Bible.
[1:35:00] He walked with them.
[1:35:03] brought a light to their darkness when
[1:35:07] the way grew so dim. How great it would
[1:35:11] be to have his footsteps in mind
[1:35:16] to walk with the master
[1:35:19] all of the time.
[1:35:22] And when trials come
[1:35:25] and death seems so nice,
[1:35:28] I'll call on the master. I know he'll be
[1:35:32] there on time. And when sickness comes
[1:35:38] and my body is in pain,
[1:35:41] all I have to do is call on his name.
[1:35:47] So why should I worry?
[1:35:51] Why should I fear when the very same
[1:35:55] Jesus
[1:35:57] saves always?
[1:36:00] He lives in my heart.
[1:36:03] He hears when I cry.
[1:36:06] I call on his name
[1:36:09] till the storm passes by.
[1:36:13] [Music]
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[1:36:17] Dear heavenly father,
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just come to you tonight so

[1:36:30] you, Lord. When Lord, we're in the
[1:36:33] middle of a week and no matter what
[1:36:35] what's been going on, we have a place

[1:36:39] in you,
[1:36:41] Lord. We we just love you so much. We
[1:36:44] just want to thank you, Lord. We ask
[1:36:46] that these things that we've heard
[1:36:47] tonight would just sink deep, Lord. That
[1:36:49] we would just dig deeper into your word,
[1:36:52] Lord. that we would trust you in
[1:36:55] everything that we do.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, we would seek your will. And Lord,
[1:36:59] we just rest in that, Father. We We love
[1:37:02] you. We ask that you would be with us as
[1:37:04] we go our separate ways as we travel
[1:37:06] home, Lord. And we just pray that we
[1:37:09] just be in your will. Everything that we
[1:37:11] say and do would be just pleasing to
[1:37:13] you, Father. We ask this tonight in
[1:37:15] Jesus Christ's name.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You're dismissed.
[1:37:21] Amen. Go in peace.
[1:37:28] Are you
