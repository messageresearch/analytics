[46:47] insane because they have no tie poost
[46:50] they have no anchor they have nothing
[46:53] that holds them in a time of trouble but
[46:55] us as Believers guess what we we got
[46:57] something when we can't hold ourselves
[47:00] when we when we let go of his hand guess
[47:02] what there's still something that holds
[47:04] us and anchors us I'm so glad for that
[47:07] this morning God bless you acts
[47:11] 17:31 and it says uh because he hath
[47:15] appointed a day in the which he will
[47:18] judge the world in righteousness by that
[47:21] man whom he hath ordained whereof he
[47:25] hath given Assurance unto all men and
[47:28] that he has raised him from the dead and
[47:32] we know that man who he is talking about
[47:34] is none other than Jesus Christ amen The
[47:38] Book of
[47:42] John chapter
[47:48] 5 verses 19-
[47:55] 23 Hallelujah
[47:57] yes
[48:00] amen then answered Jesus and said unto
[48:03] them verily verily I say unto you the
[48:05] son can do nothing of himself but what
[48:08] he seeth the father do for what things
[48:11] soever he doeth these also doeth the son
[48:16] likewise for the Father loveth the Son
[48:19] and showeth him all things that himself
[48:22] doeth and he will show him Greater Works
[48:25] than these that ye May Marvel for as the
[48:28] father raise raiseth up the dead and
[48:32] quickeneth them even so the son
[48:34] quickeneth whom he will amen I'm glad
[48:38] I'm part of Those whom he will this
[48:41] morning for the father judgeth no
[48:45] man but hath committeth all judgment
[48:49] unto the son that all men should honor
[48:52] the son even as they honor the father he
[48:55] that honth not the son son honth not the
[48:58] Father which hath sent him praise the
[49:01] Lord I want you to uh pay attention
[49:04] there it said that the father judges no
[49:08] man but he gives all judgment onto the
[49:10] son amen you may be seated this
[49:15] morning I would like to title my sermon
[49:19] this morning the Supreme judg amen now
[49:24] when God placed Adam and Eve in in the
[49:26] Garden of Eden
[49:28] there as we know very well the scripture
[49:31] and the stories everything was perfect
[49:34] and and everything ran in harmony all
[49:36] one with another and and God had given
[49:40] them something to stand behind God had
[49:43] given them something to protect them and
[49:47] it wasn't anything to do with themselves
[49:49] it wasn't uh an animal or a lion or a
[49:52] bear or something like that but God gave
[49:54] them his word to stand behind and his
[49:58] word would be their protection and as
[50:00] long as they stood behind the protection
[50:03] of the word they would be fine as long
[50:06] as they stood behind the protection of
[50:08] the word uh they would not fall into sin
[50:11] they would not fall into temptation they
[50:14] would not fall into the traps of Satan
[50:17] but as soon as they would get out from
[50:19] behind the this protection that God had
[50:22] given them we find out that everything
[50:25] fell apart and as they were in the
[50:28] Garden of Eden we see that they were uh
[50:32] naked and they knew it not and we
[50:35] understand that God had veiled their
[50:37] eyes and because they knew not that they
[50:39] were naked and brother brandham said
[50:41] this he said that they were veiled with
[50:43] a holy Veil it was a holy sight it was a
[50:48] holy life because it was a a holy God
[50:52] that they were in the presence of and
[50:55] brother brandham said that that today we
[50:57] are living in an age where it is no
[51:00] longer that people are no longer veiled
[51:02] with a holy Veil but their eyes are
[51:05] veiled with an Unholy Veil and so we see
[51:09] there that concerning this age that the
[51:12] people are lukewarm that people are
[51:15] naked blind and miserable but yet being
[51:18] in that condition that they're in the
[51:21] Bible says that they knoweth it not what
[51:24] a horrible condition it would be to be
[51:26] to be miserable and think you're happy
[51:29] to be naked and think you're closed to
[51:31] be rich but yet you're poor to have
[51:34] everything that you think you need but
[51:36] yet you have nothing because outside of
[51:39] Christ we don't have anything and so the
[51:42] spirit of the age now is an Unholy
[51:45] spirit and we can see it upon the people
[51:47] we can see it upon the people's lives
[51:49] that they're driven by evil they're
[51:52] driven by unholiness they are driven by
[51:55] the things that that Satan is is is
[51:58] bombarding them with why because they
[52:00] are veiled with an Unholy Veil there's
[52:04] no Holiness in
[52:06] them we don't have to look very far till
[52:09] we see the evilness that's within the
[52:12] world
[52:14] today it all starts at the
[52:17] top it all starts with the leaders of
[52:20] the country it all it trickles down from
[52:24] the leaders of the country to the to the
[52:26] to the leaders of the job sites to the
[52:28] business owners it trickles down then to
[52:31] the to the mayor of the city it trickles
[52:33] on down until it comes down to the heads
[52:36] of our very own
[52:38] homes we can see that the the standard
[52:41] begins here and if the people at the top
[52:44] have a low standard everybody below them
[52:47] is going to live a lower standard I say
[52:50] father no matter what the government
[52:52] says no matter what legislations they
[52:55] try to pass
[52:57] let us have the word of God be our
[53:00] standard within our homes and within our
[53:04] lives because the day is evil Hallelujah
[53:09] am so we see they're blind they're
[53:12] miserable and poor they don't even know
[53:14] it it is a spiritual condition and it is
[53:17] also a natural condition that they are
[53:21] in is it any wonder they dress and they
[53:24] act the way that they do is it any
[53:27] wonder that people can get out here and
[53:29] think they can shoot up a school and and
[53:31] take someone else's life and and have
[53:34] and think they have no repercussions of
[53:36] it is it any wonder that somebody can go
[53:39] out here and try
[53:41] to president Trump's life because
[53:45] they're veiled right with an Unholy
[53:50] Veil they're veiled and their minds are
[53:53] so consumed to where they think evil is
[53:56] good good and good is evil they are
[54:00] motivated and anointed and driven by
[54:03] unclean spirits and if we're not careful
[54:07] we get we get so LAX aisy in our own
[54:10] life we get so LAX aisy as Christians to
[54:14] where we become comfortable and we get
[54:17] used to the spirits that are driving
[54:19] this world today God wants us to call
[54:23] good good and evil evil God wants us not
[54:26] to be uh uh uh out here and and and
[54:30] sympathizing with the world he doesn't
[54:32] want us to get out here and say well if
[54:35] so and so says it's okay well I guess
[54:37] that's okay he wants men and women of
[54:40] character he wants men and women of
[54:42] conviction that are going to stand in
[54:44] their convictions in this evil
[54:47] day so we see that the people today are
[54:51] they're motivated by something they are
[54:53] driven by something they are anointed by
[54:55] something and that's the spirit of the
[55:02] devil here we
[55:04] are and Satan's
[55:06] eeden but we're not driven by those
[55:09] things we are not anointed by those
[55:11] things those things do not motivate us
[55:14] in our Christian lives but we are
[55:16] motivated and we are driven and we are
[55:19] persuaded by the Holy Spirit and the
[55:23] Holy Spirit now will motivate us to live
[55:27] a clean life it will motivate us to live
[55:30] a Pure Life it'll motivate us to live a
[55:34] good life a Godly life and try to
[55:37] motivate those and influence those
[55:40] around us to live the same kind of
[55:44] life that's why we are different than
[55:47] them because we are motivated by a
[55:51] different Spirit am we are driven by a
[55:55] different spirit and therefore it makes
[55:57] us act accordingly to the spirit that's
[56:00] within
[56:01] us that's what we're seeing right now we
[56:05] see people out there we see people
[56:06] within Christendom we see people within
[56:09] the message and all of us are driven and
[56:11] motivated by a spirit I say father let
[56:15] me lay down the things of the world let
[56:18] me lay down these unclean seducing
[56:21] spirits and let me be motivated consume
[56:24] me Lord with the fire of your
[56:27] spirit because the holy spirit will burn
[56:30] out all that other stuff in our
[56:32] lives so what are we motivated by we're
[56:35] motivated by the Holy Spirit which
[56:38] brings Holiness and modesty and honesty
[56:41] into our lives did you know that living
[56:45] an honest life is just as important as
[56:48] living a pure life living an honest life
[56:51] is just as important as being modest in
[56:53] how we present ourselves true
[56:56] because little do we know people are
[56:58] watching they're watching us in our
[57:01] lives they're watching us in our
[57:02] business they're watching us in our
[57:04] families they're watching you guys at
[57:06] school they're watching you at
[57:09] work you clock out 10 minutes early or
[57:11] 10 minutes
[57:13] after people are watching honesty I
[57:17] think we're losing honesty amongst us
[57:20] that's right because it's so easy to be
[57:23] dishonest and get away with it true it's
[57:26] so easy to be dishonest when no one else
[57:29] is watching when no one else is looking
[57:32] when no one else sees the brother deal
[57:34] that we're doing well if nobody knows I
[57:36] guess it's okay if I don't get caught I
[57:40] guess it's not illegal
[57:42] nonsense God wants us to be honest in
[57:45] our everyday life whether it be with our
[57:47] family at church in her business
[57:49] whatever it may
[57:51] be
[57:52] true what are we doing in this day we're
[57:55] manifesting in the spirit that's driving
[57:59] us within us I want you to notice now
[58:02] that when God put Adam and Eve in the
[58:04] Garden of Eden he didn't put them in
[58:07] this beautiful garden and and and and
[58:09] and put a a a force field around them
[58:13] cuz remember Satan was already cast out
[58:15] of Heaven down to the Earth that's right
[58:17] and so now Satan the Bible says that he
[58:19] walks to and fro throughout the Earth
[58:22] seeking whom he may devour devour as a
[58:25] roaring
[58:27] lion but yet God places Adam and and he
[58:31] makes a byproduct he takes Eve from his
[58:33] rib and he and he makes her because
[58:35] guess what Adam was lonely he wanted a
[58:39] helpmate he he saw all the animals that
[58:42] there were in pairs and and this one was
[58:44] in pair and he saw himself and he said
[58:45] I'm all by
[58:47] myself what is it it's an attribute of
[58:49] God it's not good for a man to be by
[58:51] himself did you know
[58:54] that a man needs a
[58:57] companion a man needs a helpmate someone
[59:00] to help him along the along the road I
[59:03] don't care how Burly he thinks he is how
[59:06] tough he thinks he is if he's going to
[59:08] be a bachelor to the
[59:10] Rapture that's a good way to get married
[59:13] guys start saying I'm going to be a
[59:15] bachelor to the Rapture and you'll
[59:17] chances are you'll get married very
[59:18] quickly typically that's how it
[59:23] happens but we see that God pleas them
[59:27] upon Earth in the garden and he made it
[59:30] so beautiful and and everything was
[59:32] perfect but yet he never built a fence
[59:35] around them to protect them he never put
[59:37] a force field around them to say well
[59:40] Satan you can only come so far you can
[59:43] go this far but you can't touch them
[59:45] because they are my children and Adam
[59:47] was made in my very image and here I
[59:49] have I made a a helpmate for him and and
[59:52] I don't want them to fall and so
[59:54] everything's just going to be perfect
[59:55] and I'm I'm going to cuddle them up and
[59:57] put in bubble wrap and they're never
[59:59] going to go through any
[1:00:01] Temptation they're never going to have
[1:00:03] any issues they're never going to have
[1:00:04] any trials any Temptations no because
[1:00:07] they're my children it's not what God
[1:00:09] did that's right but God placed them
[1:00:12] there and he gave them a word amen and
[1:00:16] when he gave them a word that word was
[1:00:18] their protection that word was their
[1:00:20] force force Shields that word was their
[1:00:23] Shield that word was their high tower
[1:00:25] that word was all they needed to stay
[1:00:27] out of temptation as long as they would
[1:00:30] stay in the word as long as we'd stay in
[1:00:32] the word this morning as long as we get
[1:00:35] behind the protection of the word this
[1:00:37] morning everything will be okay but we
[1:00:40] realize when we get out from the
[1:00:42] protection of the word bad things begin
[1:00:44] to
[1:00:46] happen and so now here was
[1:00:49] Eve man she she already had all the
[1:00:52] knowledge amen she already knew enough
[1:00:57] she didn't need to know
[1:00:59] anymore and so she begins to have a a a
[1:01:03] a a
[1:01:04] discussion with this
[1:01:07] serpent brother brandham says he wasn't
[1:01:09] a snake with no hips but he could walk
[1:01:13] and he could talk and he could
[1:01:15] reason he could talk the same language
[1:01:17] as what Eve could
[1:01:19] talk and now they have this discussion
[1:01:22] one with another and she begins to
[1:01:24] reason within her mind yeah yeah surely
[1:01:27] God is a good God and he would never
[1:01:30] have made me and and and and Adam and
[1:01:32] placed us here he wouldn't kill us and
[1:01:34] and and surely surely yeah surely you're
[1:01:38] right and she begin to reason with Satan
[1:01:41] over the word of God when we begin to
[1:01:43] reason the word of God we get out of our
[1:01:46] position in Christ Jesus because the
[1:01:49] Bible says without faith it is
[1:01:52] impossible to please God so whenever we
[1:01:55] be begin to reason and we begin to try
[1:01:58] to connect all these dots together by
[1:02:00] ourselves we are walking in the Devil's
[1:02:05] Playground a lot of times what I find
[1:02:07] what I do if I don't understand
[1:02:09] something I put it on the back burner
[1:02:11] and I forget about it and a year or two
[1:02:14] down the line guess what I open my bible
[1:02:16] or there's a sermon preached and I think
[1:02:18] wow I remember I had that question I
[1:02:22] remember I didn't understand that but
[1:02:24] you see the revelation of God unfolds to
[1:02:27] us just like brother Mario has been
[1:02:29] preaching just like he did with brother
[1:02:31] brandham he does it with you and
[1:02:36] I so we see a lot of times that as
[1:02:41] Believers we wish ourselves that you
[1:02:45] know if I could just go to the woods go
[1:02:48] up to the
[1:02:49] mountains get up by myself I'll build a
[1:02:52] cabin some of your cabins would be
[1:02:54] better than other people
[1:02:57] cabins I'll build a cabin I'll get I'll
[1:03:00] I'll I'll pick a spot beside the water
[1:03:02] and and and and so on and so forth and
[1:03:05] and this will just be awesome because
[1:03:06] it'll just be me and my family and it'll
[1:03:09] be no one else and we can grow our food
[1:03:10] and and there'll be there'll be no
[1:03:12] technology there there'll be no social
[1:03:15] media there there'll be no internet
[1:03:17] there there'll be no there'll be no
[1:03:19] women walking around half naked there
[1:03:21] there there'll be there'll be nothing
[1:03:23] there that'll really catch my attention
[1:03:25] that to take my attention off God
[1:03:27] there'll be no
[1:03:29] Temptations oh if I could only do that
[1:03:32] life would be
[1:03:34] good but I want you to notice that God
[1:03:38] has placed you in Satan's
[1:03:41] Eden for a purpose God did not place you
[1:03:45] in the mountains God did not place you
[1:03:47] to be by yourself with your family but
[1:03:50] God placed you in a city full of Filth a
[1:03:54] City full of sin a City that's full of
[1:03:57] evil spirits why would God do such a
[1:04:00] thing yes very good because he knows
[1:04:02] that he wants you to be here because he
[1:04:04] wants you to overcome Satan's Eden the
[1:04:08] first Eve fail in God's Eden but this
[1:04:11] eve shall overcome and Satan's Eden am
[1:04:15] as long as we stay behind the protection
[1:04:17] of God's word so now God gave Satan the
[1:04:21] ability and the opportunity to tempt Eve
[1:04:25] and Adam yeah and he done it and as we
[1:04:28] are here in Satan's Eden guess what God
[1:04:30] does the exact same thing he gives him
[1:04:33] the ability he gives him uh a reason to
[1:04:37] tempt
[1:04:38] us with whatever it is that you're
[1:04:40] tempted
[1:04:41] with but God has
[1:04:44] confidence that though they're tempted
[1:04:47] though they may fall I know they'll get
[1:04:49] back up
[1:04:51] again praise God so God G Satan the
[1:04:55] opportunity to tempt you yeah God is
[1:04:59] giving you and I this morning in 2024

[1:09:06] invite you over to my house
[1:09:08] anymore I don't
[1:09:11] care I'm saying no
[1:09:16] yes the best time to say no to Satan is
[1:09:18] when you're by yourself that's right
[1:09:22] because the character of a man is made
[1:09:23] in his closet that's
[1:09:26] right the character of a
[1:09:29] man is made when he's by himself that's
[1:09:33] right the character of a man is made in
[1:09:36] his prayer closet you show me a man with
[1:09:39] little character I'll show you a man
[1:09:41] with little prayer
[1:09:43] life and it's when a man is by himself
[1:09:47] that's when he makes the decisions in
[1:09:49] his life that's going to mold his
[1:09:51] character into what he's going to be or
[1:09:53] what he is amen
[1:09:56] hallelujah
[1:09:59] amen we need to say this morning as for
[1:10:03] me in my house I'm going to serve the
[1:10:07] Lord I don't care what anybody else does
[1:10:10] I don't care what happens but as for me
[1:10:13] in this house and my family in my house
[1:10:15] I'm going to serve the
[1:10:18] Lord but too much of the time as the
[1:10:21] scripture says we are as a dog
[1:10:25] as the dog that returns to his vomit so
[1:10:29] a fool repeats his
[1:10:32] Foley you ever seen a dog throw
[1:10:42] up and it looks at
[1:10:46] it and it looks at
[1:10:49] you then it looks at
[1:10:51] it and it walks away and then it goes
[1:10:55] back back to
[1:10:56] it you let that dog eat that
[1:10:59] vomit that's the most disgusting
[1:11:04] thing to turn around from the thing that
[1:11:07] made you sick right the thing that made
[1:11:10] you sick to your stomach and you
[1:11:12] absolutely throw it up and it makes you
[1:11:15] vomit but yet it looks so tasty
[1:11:26] now think how God
[1:11:28] feels come on I'm not trying to be
[1:11:32] funny think how God feels when finally
[1:11:35] you get rid of that stuff in your life
[1:11:37] that doesn't belong there as a Christian
[1:11:39] you finally throw it up and you vomit it
[1:11:42] up and God's like praise the lord it's
[1:11:44] gone but yet a few weeks or a few months
[1:11:47] later we're returning to the very thing
[1:11:49] that made us sick and we're licking it
[1:11:52] and we're eating it up again it's a
[1:11:55] Grace in the eyes of God it makes them
[1:11:59] sick put yourself in God that's how he
[1:12:02] sees us when we return to the things
[1:12:04] that we once put away a double-minded
[1:12:08] man is unstable in all of his ways God
[1:12:10] help
[1:12:11] us to let it to get away from it to let
[1:12:15] our owners clean it up if it's if it's
[1:12:18] over by our pen let's not go back near
[1:12:20] our pen again let's let our owner let's
[1:12:23] let God the Holy Spirit take take a take
[1:12:25] a little wipey a detox wipey a Clorox
[1:12:29] wipe the word and clean it all up and do
[1:12:32] away with it and throw it in the trash
[1:12:33] for that's where it belongs don't be a
[1:12:36] fool don't return to your Folly but turn
[1:12:39] away from
[1:12:42] it if you want to be a fool this
[1:12:45] morning be a fool for
[1:12:50] Christ so God spoke his word to Adam and
[1:12:54] Eve and that word was once a protection
[1:12:57] for them but when they fell from Grace
[1:13:00] when they fell from the word now the
[1:13:02] word changeed from protection to
[1:13:06] judgment he said in that day that you
[1:13:09] eat that day you shall surely
[1:13:11] die it was the protection at one point
[1:13:14] in their
[1:13:15] lives but when they got away from the
[1:13:17] word the word turns to
[1:13:19] judgment yes brother brandham said this
[1:13:22] in Redemption by judgment 1950 4 now God
[1:13:27] when he when he loved Adam and Eve so
[1:13:30] much that he had to First shed blood
[1:13:32] before he before he could the Judgment
[1:13:35] was death and something had to die in
[1:13:37] their stead and then they could stand in
[1:13:41] his presence now in there was judgment
[1:13:45] Eve first listened to Satan and he
[1:13:47] whitewashed the word over and they
[1:13:49] disbelieved the word and the word then
[1:13:52] became God's J
[1:13:55] judgment the word was their protector
[1:13:58] but when they got out from the
[1:14:00] protection of the word the word then
[1:14:03] turned into judgment now we understand
[1:14:07] that a h h h God had taken a life of an
[1:14:11] an innocent animal and we see that that
[1:14:15] that that animal the wrongs of the
[1:14:17] person was placed upon that animal it
[1:14:20] was the Guiltless was taking the place
[1:14:23] for the guilty the grace of God what was
[1:14:27] it doing something that they did not
[1:14:28] deserve they they didn't they deserve
[1:14:31] judgment but yet God's grace now
[1:14:33] provided a way for them to stand in the
[1:14:36] presence of God a Guiltless one took the
[1:14:39] place for the
[1:14:42] guilty we find in the Bible that there's
[1:14:44] five types of offerings or sacrifices
[1:14:47] that Israel brought to the Lord there
[1:14:49] was the burnt offering the grain
[1:14:51] offering the peace offering the sin
[1:14:53] offering and the trespass CL offering
[1:14:56] now brother brandom told us he said that
[1:14:59] the number five is the number of Grace
[1:15:02] and that by these offerings and
[1:15:04] sacrifices that by the grace of God that
[1:15:07] it would make a way for his people to
[1:15:09] get back into his
[1:15:10] presence but we understand that all of
[1:15:13] these different sacrifices and offerings
[1:15:16] they were just a a a a type or a shadow
[1:15:20] of Jesus Christ himself who would come
[1:15:23] and give his life at Calvary and
[1:15:25] bringing us back into the very presence
[1:15:27] of God Almighty without having the
[1:15:31] spirit of Christ in our hearts there is
[1:15:33] no way to come back into the very
[1:15:35] presence of God but I'm so thankful this
[1:15:38] morning because God did not leave us
[1:15:40] there God did not leave Adam and Eve
[1:15:43] there without making a preparation to
[1:15:45] come back into his presence but he
[1:15:47] prepared a away he's prepared a way for
[1:15:50] us this morning to be in the presence of
[1:15:53] God by the grace of God
[1:15:57] by the cross of
[1:16:00] Calvary I don't think there should ever
[1:16:03] be a sermon preached that doesn't
[1:16:04] mention the cross of
[1:16:06] Calvary the finished work of Jesus
[1:16:09] Christ of the pain and the suffering and
[1:16:11] the anguish and the and the torment that
[1:16:14] he went through for you and I the
[1:16:17] Guiltless taking the guilt of the guilty
[1:16:20] upon
[1:16:21] himself and we can say with the HW
[1:16:23] writer he became me so that I might
[1:16:27] become him by his
[1:16:29] grace in that same sermon Redemption by
[1:16:32] judgment brother brandham goes on and he
[1:16:34] says now this word the word of God will
[1:16:37] judge every person this word is being
[1:16:40] preached here this morning it's it's
[1:16:42] being preached down here down there at
[1:16:45] Wall Street preached over there at a
[1:16:47] Christian Church down at the
[1:16:49] Presbyterian Church wherever the word is
[1:16:51] being preached it becomes the Judgment
[1:16:54] amen
[1:16:55] men are judged by the word of God and
[1:16:58] here's one good thing to know we either
[1:17:02] we we either our judgment goes before us
[1:17:06] or it will follow after us so what's he
[1:17:10] trying to say he's trying to say either
[1:17:11] we take our judgment now or our judgment
[1:17:15] is going to follow us at that day of the
[1:17:17] white Throne judgment either way we're
[1:17:19] going to be judged I say father let me
[1:17:22] take my judgment right now I don't want
[1:17:25] to be standing there upon my own merits
[1:17:27] but I want to be judged according to Thy
[1:17:30] word not not upon a man's confession not
[1:17:33] upon a man's interpretation but upon the
[1:17:35] word of
[1:17:40] God you this morning in the
[1:17:43] congregation you have the opportunity to
[1:17:47] judge yourselves by the word of God
[1:17:50] that's being
[1:17:52] preached amen not just a tradition of
[1:17:55] coming to church right not just uh well
[1:17:58] this is what me and my family do we come
[1:18:00] to church we pay our ties we we we we
[1:18:03] live as good as we can no we come to
[1:18:05] church for a purpose to judge
[1:18:09] ourselves according to the word that's
[1:18:11] being preached because if we don't judge
[1:18:14] ourselves according to the word we will
[1:18:16] be judged by the
[1:18:22] word paragraph 42 now every man here
[1:18:25] today doesn't have to be judged at the
[1:18:27] end he can be judged this morning if he
[1:18:31] wants to be
[1:18:33] judged I think that's very
[1:18:36] powerful because now he places this
[1:18:39] judgment in our courts amen he places it
[1:18:42] in our laps if you want to be judged you
[1:18:45] can be judged if you want to be judged
[1:18:48] but so much of the time we is we get so
[1:18:52] carnal within ourselves that guess what
[1:18:54] we just want to come we want to hear a
[1:18:56] flower we sermon uh we want to be sang
[1:18:59] happy we want to be preached happy but
[1:19:01] we never want sin touched in our
[1:19:04] lives just leave that alone leave my
[1:19:08] personal life out of this and what I
[1:19:10] want to do in my bedroom what I want to
[1:19:12] do when I'm by myself what I want to do
[1:19:15] whenever there's no other church people
[1:19:17] around I can do what I want to do just
[1:19:20] don't hit
[1:19:21] that you're judging yourself
[1:19:25] father I
[1:19:27] say to take the judgment and to judge
[1:19:30] ourselves accordingly and to be honest
[1:19:33] with ourselves because honesty is a part
[1:19:36] of Christianity and so if we're
[1:19:39] Christians and we're honest with
[1:19:40] ourselves they said lord judge me this
[1:19:43] morning according to Thy word and if
[1:19:45] there's something in my life that I need
[1:19:47] to give up father help
[1:19:51] me don't take it from me but help me
[1:19:55] Amen to give it to you yes sir for I
[1:19:58] know if I give it to you and I give it
[1:20:01] as a you know what it is when you give
[1:20:02] something to God it's a free will
[1:20:05] offering sir it's my free will Lord I
[1:20:08] know it's wrong I know I'm doing that
[1:20:11] right I give it to you
[1:20:14] freely you'll not deal with it
[1:20:16] anymore why because out of the abundance
[1:20:19] of your heart you've given it to God but
[1:20:22] if someone tells you to give it
[1:20:25] sh tell me what to
[1:20:27] do I ain't doing it here take it I'll
[1:20:31] just work and buy something
[1:20:35] else it's amazing how we have that
[1:20:37] attitude isn't it that's the attitude we
[1:20:39] have with
[1:20:40] God let me share this with you guys you
[1:20:44] know the attitude that you have with mom
[1:20:45] and dad when they try to help you with
[1:20:47] situations in your life is actually your
[1:20:49] attitude that you're having with
[1:20:52] God sure if they're trying to tell you
[1:20:56] hey don't go there no more don't do it
[1:20:59] stop knock it off it's not good for you
[1:21:01] a Christian ought to be doing that the
[1:21:04] attitude that you have with Mom and Dad
[1:21:06] when they're trying to teach you from
[1:21:08] the
[1:21:08] scriptures the attitude you're having
[1:21:11] towards
[1:21:13] God
[1:21:18] Amen I guess we could say it's the same
[1:21:21] with the
[1:21:22] elders huh
[1:21:25] let's speak to the elders for a
[1:21:28] second yeah you got stuff you need to
[1:21:30] give up and you know it whenever the
[1:21:33] preacher preaches or wherever your wife
[1:21:35] or husband says something to you the
[1:21:36] attitude that you have towards the
[1:21:38] preacher your husband or your wife is
[1:21:41] the attitude that you have towards
[1:21:44] God because it is God using the vessel
[1:21:48] to speak to the sin that's in our
[1:21:52] lives right
[1:21:55] Hallelujah I receive that
[1:21:58] Lord brother brandham says now of God in
[1:22:01] order to bring carry and on with that
[1:22:03] same quote if God in order to bring Adam
[1:22:06] and Eve into his presence he had to make
[1:22:08] a preparation now what did that he says
[1:22:12] if you don't believe in grace Grace
[1:22:15] provided a
[1:22:18] preparation I know there's some of you
[1:22:20] that don't like to read past 1963 but I
[1:22:23] think this is very powerful
[1:22:27] 1954 he says Grace provided a
[1:22:31] preparation oh how happy I am for that
[1:22:35] Grace provided a preparation Grace is
[1:22:38] God grace is love God so loved his
[1:22:40] Fallen creatures that he provided a
[1:22:43] preparation to stand them in his
[1:22:46] presence
[1:22:48] before
[1:22:50] judgment so before the judgments of God
[1:22:53] could come to pass pass in their life
[1:22:56] God already prepared a way for them to
[1:22:59] come back into his presence
[1:23:02] again God went and killed sheep and
[1:23:04] animals put skins on them to cover them
[1:23:06] up and blood was first made before the
[1:23:09] judgment and this is powerful the
[1:23:12] Judgment was through the blood of
[1:23:15] course and then he shed the blood of the
[1:23:18] innocent to cover up the guilt of the
[1:23:20] guilty he said the he said the Jud
[1:23:24] judgement was through the
[1:23:28] blood go and listen to the whole sermon
[1:23:32] I listen to it throughout the week it's
[1:23:34] it's a it's powerful what does he mean
[1:23:36] by judgment through the
[1:23:38] blood he means that Jesus Christ that
[1:23:42] our judgment our guilt our shame our
[1:23:45] trespasses our faults and our failures
[1:23:47] everything that we could name is all
[1:23:50] under the blood so the blood are Jesus
[1:23:54] Christ became our judgment and so the
[1:23:58] Judgment Hallelujah was made through the
[1:24:04] blood it was the grace of God that made
[1:24:07] a way for Adam and Eve to stand in the
[1:24:09] presence of God before judgment kicked
[1:24:12] in it was the grace of God that prepared
[1:24:15] a way for Noah and his family before God
[1:24:19] struck the Earth with the Judgment of
[1:24:21] water God will always give a warning
[1:24:24] before he sends judgment because he is a
[1:24:28] just
[1:24:29] [Music]
[1:24:33] God he gave a warning to lot and his
[1:24:36] family of the impending judgment that
[1:24:38] was coming to Sodom by the two angels
[1:24:41] you know where Sodom where lot got mixed
[1:24:43] up in Sodom the Bible says that that he
[1:24:45] sat at the Gate of Sodom and in other
[1:24:48] words lot got caught up with the
[1:24:51] political issues of Sodom he was a gate
[1:24:54] he was a judge at the gate he got caught
[1:24:56] up with L AIA he got caught up with
[1:24:59] things that he shouldn't have been
[1:25:00] getting caught up with as a Believer and
[1:25:03] because of this his heart turned hard
[1:25:06] and when the angel of God the two angels
[1:25:09] came to uh uh to get him and his family
[1:25:11] out there he was
[1:25:14] hesitant you got to be kidding me here
[1:25:17] you have two angels God is preparing a
[1:25:20] way for you God is showing grace to you
[1:25:23] you've made all these wrong decisions
[1:25:24] but God is is still a graceful God and
[1:25:27] and he's trying to prepare a way for you
[1:25:29] to get you out of here but yet you're
[1:25:30] you're
[1:25:32] questioning but yet you're holding back
[1:25:36] saints of God we ought to stop holding
[1:25:39] back we ought to we ought to get start
[1:25:41] getting a little bit more uncomfortable
[1:25:43] here in louia cuz I feel like we're too
[1:25:47] comfortable we're we're getting a little
[1:25:49] bit too lukewarm for our own good
[1:25:54] hop out of the nest
[1:25:56] yourself before God has to make it
[1:25:59] uncomfortable for you to hop
[1:26:01] out
[1:26:04] Hallelujah so it was the grace of God he
[1:26:06] he he made a way for a lot he gave
[1:26:09] warnings through His prophets to the
[1:26:11] children of Israel and he would tell
[1:26:13] them if you don't repent if you don't
[1:26:15] get right if you if you don't take down
[1:26:18] the go the Graven altars and this and
[1:26:20] that and the other uh there's a judgment
[1:26:22] coming your way you're you're going to
[1:26:24] be taken into captivity you're going to
[1:26:25] go into Babylon you're this that and God
[1:26:28] sent Prophet after Prophet after
[1:26:32] Prophet but yet because of the hardness
[1:26:34] of their
[1:26:35] hearts they would not
[1:26:38] listen it's not just a story it's not
[1:26:41] just an example but we can put our place
[1:26:44] our names Our lives our family within
[1:26:48] that scripture and say father how many
[1:26:50] times have you warned me how many times
[1:26:53] have you told me not to do that or go
[1:26:55] here or whatever it might be but yet
[1:26:57] I've done it but our hearts gets
[1:26:59] hardened instead of us softening our
[1:27:02] hearts and coming to our God and saying
[1:27:05] father forgive me yes in that same
[1:27:09] sermon brother Bram says this he says
[1:27:12] that the best way to stop the judgments
[1:27:15] of God is a quick
[1:27:20] repentance just like
[1:27:22] Hezekiah here is Hezekiah he's on his
[1:27:25] deathbed God sends uh Isaiah to him and
[1:27:28] says you're going to die and he turns
[1:27:30] his his face to the wall and he cries
[1:27:33] out to God and he goes oh Father uh I I
[1:27:37] I need 15 more
[1:27:39] years I need 15 years I'm to get my
[1:27:43] house in order to get my family's life
[1:27:46] in line and God give him 15 more years
[1:27:50] because his motive was
[1:27:53] this it's going to take me that long to
[1:27:56] get my family in
[1:27:58] line can you imagine he was a king so
[1:28:01] I'm sure he had many
[1:28:03] kids but it was going to take him 15
[1:28:07] years the Judgment was already cast upon
[1:28:09] him he was going to die but God saw the
[1:28:13] motive in his heart that father is going
[1:28:16] to take me this long and that's why God
[1:28:19] told Isaiah go right back in there and
[1:28:21] tell him you got 15 more years
[1:28:24] did God change his mind about him dying
[1:28:28] did God change his mind about the
[1:28:30] Judgment that was coming on his life no
[1:28:33] but because his motive was right in his
[1:28:36] heart God heard his prayer that's a good
[1:28:39] example for you and
[1:28:41] I we think about things and we and we
[1:28:44] pray about things and we have questions
[1:28:46] about things but what is our motive
[1:28:48] behind what we're doing in sing what is
[1:28:50] our motive behind what we're praying to
[1:28:52] God and asking him about because if our
[1:28:54] motive is not correctly God will not
[1:28:57] answer that prayer but if we have the
[1:28:59] right motive and we have the right
[1:29:01] objective and we have the right approach
[1:29:03] to God and we have the right approach to
[1:29:06] one another guess what God will hear our
[1:29:09] prayers and our fellow servants in the
[1:29:11] body will listen to what we have to
[1:29:14] say but if our approach is
[1:29:17] wrong if our motives are wrong the
[1:29:21] outcome is going to be wrong
[1:29:24] we have to be so careful saints of God
[1:29:27] let me speak from my heart now we have
[1:29:30] to be so careful to keep respect for one
[1:29:33] another
[1:29:35] true you know I'll share this brother
[1:29:38] Elias we was up hunting the other week
[1:29:40] up in Flagstaff and and it was nice it
[1:29:42] was more of like a I took my family
[1:29:45] camping and then took them hunting with
[1:29:46] me and and uh it was fun got the kids in
[1:29:50] the car and and and we were you know
[1:29:52] Road hunting 101 man man it's it's uh
[1:29:55] it's the best and um and especially when
[1:29:59] you're not too worried about getting
[1:30:00] something you don't really care it's for
[1:30:02] the kids right so the boys man they let
[1:30:05] this little bonfire and let this little
[1:30:06] fire and I thought wow that's pretty
[1:30:08] good and it got so big so all of a
[1:30:10] sudden I was like well I better go sit
[1:30:12] beside the fire because it's getting
[1:30:14] kind of big and out of control here so I
[1:30:16] sat down and brother elas was there and
[1:30:19] they came over and sat next to me and
[1:30:20] and we were just talking one with
[1:30:21] another and he asked me a question he
[1:30:23] said uh brother Steven when is it okay
[1:30:26] to call you brother Steven and when is
[1:30:28] it okay to call you
[1:30:29] Steve I said that's a fantastic
[1:30:32] question because it's a question that we
[1:30:35] all wonder my name is Stephen everybody
[1:30:38] here calls me Steve and and and and
[1:30:41] that's my name so I don't get offended
[1:30:44] when people call me by my name and I'm
[1:30:46] sure you're all the same way my answer
[1:30:48] to brother Elias was this I said
[1:30:51] whenever we're in a church setting and
[1:30:53] we're at church or we're around church
[1:30:55] folk or whatever call me brother Stephen
[1:30:58] because it's a respect thing sure and it
[1:31:02] lets everybody else see that you respect
[1:31:04] the office within the
[1:31:07] assembly and I was like you don't want
[1:31:09] visards visitors to be around and and
[1:31:11] you go hey hey Steve hey let me show you
[1:31:15] the deer that I shot you know brother
[1:31:17] Elias can't wait to tell me
[1:31:19] that you guys don't understand that
[1:31:22] joke I can't wait to see say that either
[1:31:27] Elias and everybody else is watching and
[1:31:31] they're like wow this guy has absolutely
[1:31:34] no respect for him isn't he his
[1:31:37] brother but when we're at a family get
[1:31:42] together and we're camping and it's
[1:31:44] lowkey hey Steve is good
[1:31:48] right but I was happy and I was pleased
[1:31:52] by him asking the question because he
[1:31:55] knew he said you know what uh we were
[1:31:57] out here and I said Steve in front of
[1:31:59] everybody and I got a little convicted
[1:32:01] so then I said brother Steve and it just
[1:32:03] didn't feel right where we were at so
[1:32:06] which one is right well they're both
[1:32:08] right in different instances very
[1:32:11] good and so it's so easy for us as
[1:32:13] Believers to lose respect one for
[1:32:15] another true we get so familiar with
[1:32:18] each other Rocko used to tell me all the
[1:32:21] time familiarity breeds content
[1:32:24] a we get so familiar one with another
[1:32:26] it's just like family we get so close
[1:32:28] and used to each other and and and all
[1:32:31] of a sudden it breeds content in our
[1:32:33] lives between
[1:32:35] us if you lose a respect for your wife
[1:32:38] and you lose talking to her respectfully
[1:32:41] it's going to breed
[1:32:42] content if you lose respect for your
[1:32:45] husband go figure it's going to breed
[1:32:47] content in your marriage young people if
[1:32:50] you lose respect for one another and
[1:32:52] your parents is going to breed what
[1:32:56] contempt if you lose respect for the
[1:32:58] deacons
[1:32:59] trustees soundmen
[1:33:03] musicians song leaders
[1:33:05] preachers and
[1:33:08] Pastor if we lose the respect one for
[1:33:11] another it breeds content in our
[1:33:15] lives let me admonish you this morning
[1:33:17] my brother and my sister don't lose
[1:33:20] respect one for another true the Bible
[1:33:23] says for
[1:33:24] to treat the Elder women as
[1:33:28] mothers that's respectful yes that's
[1:33:31] right to treat the younger as sisters
[1:33:32] and
[1:33:33] brothers and to give those the Bishops
[1:33:37] who have ruled over us double honor
[1:33:41] yes wow
[1:33:45] yes put myself in there preacher give me
[1:33:49] one and a half
[1:33:54] even when I don't deserve it as a
[1:33:57] person respect the office that's true
[1:34:01] because in respecting the office you're
[1:34:02] respecting God that's very Hallelujah
[1:34:04] somebody give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:34:06] [Applause]
[1:34:12] Praise so we see here that that God
[1:34:15] sends a warning before he sends judgment
[1:34:18] and we've already talked about lot and
[1:34:20] we we can go down through the scriptures
[1:34:21] of the different uh uh uh uh prophets
[1:34:24] and apostles and so on and so forth and
[1:34:27] we realize that God has sent us a
[1:34:30] message in this day and it it is a
[1:34:32] message of warning it was a message of
[1:34:34] warning of come out of her my people and
[1:34:37] be not partakers of her of her sins and
[1:34:40] of her trespasses he he told us who the
[1:34:43] this mother Harlot was he told us who
[1:34:45] this the the who her daughters are he
[1:34:48] told us the system that's behind it he
[1:34:51] told us and he warned us of the spirit
[1:34:53] behind organized religion he didn't just
[1:34:56] tell us this for no reason he was
[1:34:58] warning us because those systems are
[1:35:01] coming into judgment and so he's saying
[1:35:03] come out of her my people be not
[1:35:06] partakers of her judgment because I'm
[1:35:08] going to set you aside because my bride
[1:35:11] cannot be
[1:35:14] judged so it's a warning it's a
[1:35:17] declaration what is he doing he's
[1:35:19] warning us to come out of sin to come
[1:35:21] out of loud here to come out of Church
[1:35:24] organization and to come into the word
[1:35:27] because the word is where our safety
[1:35:31] is we've been warned to apply the token
[1:35:34] to our homes we've been warned that the
[1:35:37] coming of the Lord is drawing nigh to
[1:35:40] get ready and to trim our lights and so
[1:35:43] we are so far down the road
[1:35:46] now that we are without
[1:35:50] excuse let me join my voice with the all
[1:35:53] other voices that have went on of the
[1:35:55] warnings that we have before
[1:35:58] us God is not going to let you get by
[1:36:01] with sin in your
[1:36:04] life without bringing you to judgment in
[1:36:07] some kind of way in this life if you're
[1:36:11] a son or a daughter of God God ain't
[1:36:13] going to let you get away with it he
[1:36:15] ain't just going to sit by and and and
[1:36:17] say it's okay and tap you on the back
[1:36:19] and say uh well I I'll have Grace on you
[1:36:24] it's all right no no no no no no the
[1:36:26] grace of God provided a way back into
[1:36:31] the presence of God that's true straight
[1:36:34] line
[1:36:38] Grace and I'm so thankful for it this
[1:36:42] morning because he paved a way for my
[1:36:47] life he paved a way for your life when
[1:36:51] you were lost in sin and on Highway to
[1:36:54] Hell gu what God did he provided a
[1:36:57] sacrifice for you the Guiltless for the
[1:37:01] guilty the sinless for The
[1:37:04] Sinner and he provided a way back into
[1:37:08] his very presence in this end time
[1:37:10] through the message of the hour by
[1:37:12] sending a Vindicated Prophet to do what
[1:37:15] to prepare you Hallelujah for his soon
[1:37:20] coming oh you talk about Grace amen
[1:37:25] but he's not just going to stand by and
[1:37:28] let you do and get away with anything
[1:37:30] that you want to do why because he's a
[1:37:33] just God and when we get out from behind
[1:37:35] the protection of the word there's
[1:37:37] nothing left but judgment for
[1:37:39] us judge yourselves this
[1:37:44] morning in the sermon the voice of the
[1:37:47] sign uh
[1:37:49] 1964 notice sign what does the sign do
[1:37:52] the sign is to attract the attention and
[1:37:54] get the elected ready amen hallelujah I
[1:37:58] want to slow down in this because you
[1:38:00] just read it and you lose it what's it
[1:38:02] to do is to attract the attention and
[1:38:04] what get the elected ready what's it
[1:38:07] doing it's grace of God providing away
[1:38:10] for his soon
[1:38:12] coming he says uh to get the elected
[1:38:15] radi and out of the way before judgment
[1:38:19] strikes that's what Noah did got the
[1:38:21] elected lady the red to them what does
[1:38:24] it do the sign and the voice of the sign
[1:38:27] condemns the unbeliever and gets him
[1:38:29] ready for judgment it gets the elected
[1:38:31] ready for the Escape that's what sign is
[1:38:35] that's what signs are given for for the
[1:38:38] coming judgment to the elected they see
[1:38:41] it like the little woman listen to this
[1:38:43] the little woman with a pure heart and a
[1:38:48] defiled body and the Pharisee with a
[1:38:51] pure body and a a defiled heart which
[1:38:56] one are you this
[1:38:59] morning I know this I'm a man of unclean
[1:39:03] lips and I dwell among people with
[1:39:05] unclean
[1:39:07] lips but my
[1:39:09] [Applause]
[1:39:17] heart it's all about your heart the very
[1:39:20] judgments that saved Moses condemned the
[1:39:22] world his preaching it gets the elected
[1:39:26] ready what is the elected ready for when
[1:39:29] they see a godsend sign they look back
[1:39:31] in the scripture and see if that's
[1:39:35] supposed to be there yeah here it is
[1:39:38] what is it pending judgment then the
[1:39:42] elected listens to the
[1:39:47] voice what is different about
[1:39:50] us and Joseph Smith and the Mormons
[1:39:54] they believe God sent the prophet they
[1:39:57] believe in God they believe in the word
[1:40:00] that the prophet sent so what makes our
[1:40:03] Prophet different than their Prophet
[1:40:07] I'll tell you what makes them different
[1:40:09] our Prophet points us back to the
[1:40:12] word he tells you the signs of the
[1:40:16] times he has a sign that attracts our
[1:40:18] attention and he says go back and check
[1:40:21] it with the word of God cuz the word is
[1:40:23] our absolute go back and check it with
[1:40:26] the word and if it's in the word it's
[1:40:28] true amen amen what did Joseph Smith
[1:40:31] do wrote a new book he wrote a new Bible
[1:40:36] he wrote a new book of living He yeah he
[1:40:39] saw angels and stuff too whatever but
[1:40:42] that book did not bring us back to the
[1:40:44] scriptures anything that takes us away
[1:40:46] from the word let me say this is
[1:40:49] Antichrist it is not spirit-led man of
[1:40:52] God because Spirit men spirit-led man of
[1:40:55] God man sent from God will always take
[1:40:58] us back to the
[1:41:03] word so what has the grace of God done
[1:41:05] for us it has prepared a way for escape
[1:41:09] uh escaping the judgments of God that's
[1:41:11] going to strike this Earth and because
[1:41:15] we've been
[1:41:16] forewarned it makes the judgments of God
[1:41:19] just
[1:41:23] because God will not bring a person to
[1:41:26] judgment without forewarning him works
[1:41:29] his faith expressed paragraph 252
[1:41:32] brother bradam he says it was revealed
[1:41:34] to me I was going to Arizona and there
[1:41:36] I'd meet seven angels and we know that
[1:41:38] before brother Brandon went out there
[1:41:40] there was uh six people that had uh that
[1:41:43] that had
[1:41:44] dreams six is the number of men but the
[1:41:48] seventh one was a vision from God to
[1:41:50] brother bradam himself of this blast
[1:41:52] that would took place so here we have
[1:41:54] God is completed in seven and he's got
[1:41:58] the six dreams now the seventh that is
[1:42:00] completed it's time for him to go out to
[1:42:02] Arizona because he has this vision of
[1:42:05] this of this Mighty blast that's going
[1:42:07] to take place and he doesn't understand
[1:42:10] it he says I was going to Arizona and
[1:42:12] there I'd meet seven angels and they
[1:42:14] would tell me oh a a message that I was
[1:42:16] to preach and that was the Seven Seals
[1:42:19] he says it happened how many remembers
[1:42:22] me saying that the tapes and things
[1:42:23] recorded it and it happened magazines
[1:42:25] everything else took the picture of it
[1:42:27] that light there in the air they can't
[1:42:29] even understand it yet there it was I
[1:42:31] remember brother Jack and uh calling
[1:42:33] brother Jack and asking him about that
[1:42:35] Christ being standing there and brother
[1:42:38] Jack said that's in his glorified State
[1:42:42] we know that he's talking about
[1:42:44] Revelation chapter one where brother
[1:42:46] Brandon where the Bible says that there
[1:42:48] he stood uh with white hair as wool and
[1:42:53] so he's asking this brother and he said
[1:42:55] hey what do you think this means and and
[1:42:57] and he begins to give his own
[1:43:00] understanding and brother Jack says
[1:43:02] that's in his glorified state
[1:43:04] seat I love brother Jack he's one of the
[1:43:07] best theologians I know of but I just
[1:43:10] couldn't hit it just right I was
[1:43:12] standing there I said Lord how is this
[1:43:14] young man here I said with hair like
[1:43:17] wool and he said he is wigged watching
[1:43:20] the book before it ever happened I I
[1:43:23] said that and that day when that
[1:43:25] happened it went up and then you turn
[1:43:28] the picture sideways if you got luk
[1:43:30] magazine Our Life Magazine turned
[1:43:32] sideways there he is just perfectly
[1:43:34] Hoffman's head of Christ looking right
[1:43:36] down where I was standing there it is in
[1:43:38] the magazine how many how many's ever
[1:43:40] seen it sure of course you've all seen
[1:43:42] it looking back proved exactly the
[1:43:45] Revelation was correct why wig why the
[1:43:48] old English judges the Jewish judges
[1:43:51] they would wear a wig they do yet in
[1:43:52] England that's supreme authority he
[1:43:56] wears a wig and that showed him standing
[1:43:58] there wigged by Angels Wings he is the
[1:44:01] Alpha and the Omega he is the Supreme
[1:44:05] judge none other but him he is to look
[1:44:08] upon as Alpha and Omega there he was a
[1:44:10] young man no or more 30 years old
[1:44:12] wearing a white wearing a wig of white
[1:44:15] showing that he was Supreme God the
[1:44:19] father has committed all judgment onto
[1:44:22] the hands of the son Hallelujah the
[1:44:25] Revelation is never wrong speak it
[1:44:26] anyhow no matter what it sounds like
[1:44:29] goes right with the
[1:44:32] word so now it's it's it's it's changing
[1:44:37] brother brandom is pulling this this our
[1:44:40] opening scripture in with in with this
[1:44:43] cloud and he's saying that that now this
[1:44:46] the the Judgment the father is not going
[1:44:49] to judge anybody but the judgment is
[1:44:51] giving given onto the son
[1:44:53] and so now he sees him as Hoffman's head
[1:44:56] of Christ in this pillar of cloud with
[1:44:58] this white wig on and now brother
[1:45:00] brandham is tying this together and he's
[1:45:02] saying here's the Fulfillment of the
[1:45:05] scripture here's the Fulfillment of John
[1:45:07] chapter 5 whatever verse it was here is
[1:45:10] the Fulfillment of Revelation chap 1
[1:45:13] there he stands as a judge with this
[1:45:16] white wig on the white is a
[1:45:18] representation of righteousness it is a
[1:45:21] representation of supreme Authority
[1:45:24] because he is now the Supreme
[1:45:28] judge God does nothing on Earth until he
[1:45:32] declares it first in the
[1:45:35] heavens so now he sees this cloud and he
[1:45:39] receives this revelation of these Seven
[1:45:42] Seals how can J how can God judge
[1:45:46] somebody from a closed
[1:45:50] book open the book and tell me what I'm
[1:45:53] being judged for I can't do it because
[1:45:55] it's sealed with Seven Seals it's a it's
[1:45:58] a closed book but now the dispensation
[1:46:02] is beginning to change and God declared
[1:46:05] it first in the heavens now that he's
[1:46:08] I'll say this that Mercy is still on the
[1:46:11] throne because when the last Son of God
[1:46:14] takes their position within the body
[1:46:16] then the Rapture goes because he steps
[1:46:20] off of The Mercy Seat there's no more
[1:46:22] blood there's no more mercy and he comes
[1:46:25] forth as a
[1:46:28] judge declaring it in the heavens first
[1:46:31] of a changing of dispensation what is
[1:46:34] beginning to
[1:46:36] happen times are beginning to change he
[1:46:39] is now beginning to make his move from
[1:46:42] lamb to lion from Mercy to
[1:46:47] judge but I want to say this morning
[1:46:51] that there is still hope am there is
[1:46:54] still mercy upon the mercy seat for you
[1:46:56] and I and I am thankful for that but it
[1:47:00] lets us realize exactly where are we at
[1:47:03] my brother my
[1:47:05] sister where are we at in the time piece
[1:47:08] of
[1:47:10] God the dispensation is beginning to
[1:47:12] change the Gentiles dispensation is
[1:47:14] about over God is going to move to the
[1:47:17] Jews we see Israel at War we see uh
[1:47:20] Russia we see Russia starting to send
[1:47:23] fighter jets over uh over uh
[1:47:27] Alaska and our Administration was
[1:47:30] scrambling to get fighter jets up there
[1:47:33] we see that the US is and the West is
[1:47:35] now uh NATO are now allowing uh long
[1:47:38] range
[1:47:40] missiles in Ukraine to reach into Russia
[1:47:44] what is happening before our very
[1:47:47] wondering eyes I thought it was I I I
[1:47:49] watched a little video on Putin the
[1:47:51] other day and uh you know I'll I'll give
[1:47:55] President Putin this he's a man with a
[1:47:58] backbone he won't cave I kind of like
[1:48:02] that and and and he got some attributes
[1:48:05] about him that's pretty
[1:48:07] good comparing to some other
[1:48:14] countries you ever see that uh you ever
[1:48:17] see that that picture and and and Putin
[1:48:20] has his shirt off and he's got his army
[1:48:22] camps on and stuff and I don't know if
[1:48:24] it's photoshopped but he's ripped he's
[1:48:25] got a sixpack and everything and and
[1:48:28] Obama had a little
[1:48:29] [Laughter]
[1:48:33] kitten I don't know if it's photosho but
[1:48:36] I thought it was pretty
[1:48:39] good but we look and we see the signs of
[1:48:41] the times and the wars and the rumors of
[1:48:43] wars and Putin President Putin said this
[1:48:46] he said uh he said you know these NATO
[1:48:50] guys or these Ukrainian guys don't even
[1:48:52] know how to use these these missile
[1:48:54] launchers because it's all by
[1:48:58] satellite and I begin to wonder and
[1:49:00] brother brandham said the judgments of
[1:49:03] God is hanging in the skies atomic bombs
[1:49:07] he says that are directed by
[1:49:12] satellites where are we
[1:49:16] at we're at the end time
[1:49:26] so we see then now that God has provided
[1:49:29] a way for us to come back into his
[1:49:31] presence before the judgments of God are
[1:49:34] passed in our lives he who was
[1:49:38] judged he who was judged as the guilty
[1:49:42] though he was Guiltless he who was
[1:49:45] judged as a sinner though he was
[1:49:50] sinless the he who was judged with the
[1:49:52] weight of the sins of the world on his
[1:49:56] shoulders has now become or is going to
[1:49:59] become let me say that the Supreme judge
[1:50:04] with supreme
[1:50:06] authority John chapter 5:22 it says for
[1:50:09] the father judges no man but hath
[1:50:11] committed all judgment onto the son as
[1:50:14] the musicians come I'll read this quote
[1:50:16] and I'll close the PMA Vision brother
[1:50:19] brandham says Nathaniel said onto him
[1:50:21] whence knowest thou me and Jesus
[1:50:23] answered and said unto him before that
[1:50:25] Philip called thee when thou was under
[1:50:26] the Fig Tree I saw thee there it is when
[1:50:29] he comes that word will come against all
[1:50:32] nations and all men and none will be
[1:50:34] able to stand against it it will reveal
[1:50:36] what was in every heart as he did with
[1:50:39] Nathaniel the word of God will show who
[1:50:41] did the will of God and who didn't it
[1:50:44] will make known the secret works of
[1:50:46] every man and why he did them it will
[1:50:49] divide aunder that is what it says in
[1:50:52] Romans 2 and3 and thinkest thou this oh
[1:50:55] man that judges them which do such
[1:50:57] things and doest the same that thou
[1:50:59] shalt escape the Judgment of God then it
[1:51:02] goes on to say how God is going to judge
[1:51:04] men here it is in verses 5-1 17 the hard
[1:51:08] and penitent heart will be
[1:51:11] judged The Works will be judged the
[1:51:15] motives will be judged this is in every
[1:51:18] person there won't be any respect before
[1:51:21] God but all will be judged by that word
[1:51:24] no one escaping it
[1:51:27] those listen to this those who heard and
[1:51:30] wouldn't listen will be judged by what
[1:51:34] they
[1:51:34] heard those that rested in it saying
[1:51:37] they believed it but didn't live it
[1:51:42] wow will be
[1:51:44] judged every secret will come out in the
[1:51:47] open and be shouted from the housetops
[1:51:49] oh we will really understand history
[1:51:52] then there won't be a mystery left from
[1:51:55] all the
[1:51:57] ages I want to ask you this
[1:52:00] morning where does judgment
[1:52:03] begin begins at the house of God Amen I
[1:52:08] want to say that this
[1:52:10] building is a house of God it is a place
[1:52:13] where we come and it's a place where we
[1:52:16] worship it's a place where the word Goes
[1:52:18] Forth and it judges the people but the
[1:52:21] ultimate House of God
[1:52:23] God where the judgment begins is right
[1:52:28] here don't you know that you are the
[1:52:30] Temple of the Holy Ghost don't you know
[1:52:33] that you are a a a a a dwelling place
[1:52:36] for
[1:52:37] God that this natural man that I am it
[1:52:42] contains the very Zoey life of God
[1:52:46] himself and so the Judgment of God
[1:52:50] begins right here
[1:52:53] in the heart of every believer in the
[1:52:55] heart of every non-believer and in the
[1:52:58] heart of every makeb
[1:53:00] believer so the word has gone forth this
[1:53:04] morning and some of you might say well
[1:53:06] brother Steven I thought the bride
[1:53:09] doesn't go through
[1:53:10] judgment that's at the white Throne
[1:53:13] that's not
[1:53:15] now now we want to receive our judgment
[1:53:19] and now we want to judge ourselves
[1:53:22] according to the very principles of
[1:53:25] God's word and the message of the
[1:53:29] hour so what are your judgments this
[1:53:32] morning upon
[1:53:34] yourself not upon what somebody else
[1:53:37] says about you not upon what the
[1:53:40] minister says or anybody else thinks but
[1:53:42] what are your judgments upon yourself
[1:53:45] what are you going to do with this Jesus
[1:53:48] called Christ what are you going to do
[1:53:50] with the word that is being preached
[1:53:52] here today how are you going to judge
[1:53:57] yourself it's all bow our heads this
[1:54:05] morning the Judgment doesn't
[1:54:09] belong to your fellow
[1:54:11] neighbor but your judgment belongs to
[1:54:15] yourself in your house of
[1:54:18] God perhaps there's somebody here this
[1:54:22] morning and you would like to raise your
[1:54:24] hand not to me but to God God bless you
[1:54:28] young man God bless you look at that
[1:54:31] hands everywhere God bless you and you
[1:54:33] would like to say father I judge myself
[1:54:37] according to your word and I see Lord
[1:54:41] where I've been falling
[1:54:43] short I see father where I've
[1:54:46] been losing my focus to the things of
[1:54:49] louia and everything that's going on but
[1:54:52] Lord this morning I want to dedicate my
[1:54:55] life back to thee for a life of service
[1:54:59] and say father forgive me of the things
[1:55:02] that I've done I'm starting over again
[1:55:05] God sees those hands this morning God
[1:55:07] richly bless you let's pray together
[1:55:09] father Lord you see the hands and more
[1:55:13] importantly you see the motive and the
[1:55:15] Heart behind the hand that was raised
[1:55:19] father God I pray that every sincere
[1:55:22] heart that has defied gravity here this
[1:55:24] morning and are judging themselves
[1:55:27] according to your word Lord would leave
[1:55:29] this place like we heard our pastor say
[1:55:32] this morning not as a forgetful hearer
[1:55:35] but father we would take these things
[1:55:37] and write them upon the tables of our
[1:55:39] hearts Lord that we would remember the
[1:55:42] work that you've done here Lord and how
[1:55:45] you've convicted Our Lives father and
[1:55:48] Lord I even raise my own hands Lord
[1:55:51] because your word is a two-edged sword
[1:55:53] it's just as good for me as it is for
[1:55:56] the people in the congregation and I
[1:55:59] judge myself father according to Thy
[1:56:02] word and thy precepts and I pray Lord
[1:56:05] Jesus Lord that you give me strength and
[1:56:09] that you would help me Lord to fight the
[1:56:11] good fight of faith and father to lay
[1:56:14] aside these these sins and these things
[1:56:17] that so easily beset us and that we
[1:56:20] would run this race Lord this last
[1:56:22] little piece of this race the finish
[1:56:25] line is before us Lord help us to run
[1:56:27] Lord with with an authority
[1:56:30] father with the word of God hidden
[1:56:33] within our hearts I commit these people
[1:56:36] and myself to you Lord do with us as you

[2:00:15] good preaching amen this message brother
[2:00:19] Brenham said is becoming clearer amen
[2:00:22] and
[2:00:23] clearer amen he said the bride the only
[2:00:26] judgment that she will see is now and it
[2:00:30] is a
[2:00:31] self-judgment she hears the word judges
[2:00:34] herself comes gets convicted said Lord
[2:00:37] forgive me comes under the blood and she
[2:00:40] is cleansed by his blood as though she
[2:00:42] never did
[2:00:43] it foolish virgin here's the same
[2:00:47] word doesn't come under the Judgment
[2:00:50] doesn't come doesn't live it
[2:00:52] and therefore is going to be
[2:00:55] left and she will go through judgment
[2:00:57] when will that be
[2:01:00] tribulation three and 1/2 years she'll
[2:01:02] be
[2:01:04] judged when the Rapture goes
[2:01:08] blood is off of the
[2:01:11] earth there's no more Mercy you've
[2:01:14] passed from mer Mercy to
[2:01:17] judgment I would say that each one of us
[2:01:20] here would say oh oh God let me not be
[2:01:23] judged in Tribulation let me be judged
[2:01:27] now at your house here by
[2:01:31] [Music]
[2:01:34] myself I didn't come here to see how
[2:01:37] good I
[2:01:38] am I came here to see where I
[2:01:43] lack you say well I've got problems I've
[2:01:45] got
[2:01:46] issues Jesus said I did not come to
[2:01:49] those who do not need a physician
[2:01:55] [Music]
[2:02:00] it's time of judgment now yes the word
[2:02:04] Supreme judge he said they took the
[2:02:07] picture we didn't take it he said there
[2:02:09] I wasn't looking at it right he said
[2:02:11] Elias turn the picture he said there he
[2:02:13] is oh my god there he is supreme judge
[2:02:19] the white hair of his wig the angels
[2:02:22] made the white hair of his wig do you
[2:02:24] see it there in the midst of a
[2:02:26] consolation of seven angels amen is
[2:02:29] Christ the word return back to the
[2:02:32] church that's our
[2:02:34] judgment that's why when we heard those
[2:02:37] say our lives we say oh God oh
[2:02:41] God I bring myself under that judgment
[2:02:46] amen and Lord forgive me for my unbelief
[2:02:49] forgive me of my complexes forgive me of
[2:02:52] my mortality forgive me of my
[2:02:56] [Music]
[2:03:00] Humanity the Bible says if we confess
[2:03:03] our faults that's
[2:03:06] right he is faithful and
[2:03:09] just to forgive us
[2:03:13] amen I think everyone here could raise
[2:03:16] her hand and so said Lord I confess my
[2:03:19] faults this morning and I say I I i i i
[2:03:22] judge myself right here and I'm saying
[2:03:25] oh God let there be Mercy not judgment
[2:03:28] so therefore father I come under that
[2:03:31] because of conviction in My Heart Lord
[2:03:35] let me not be foolish this morning let
[2:03:38] me not be foolish let me not be found
[2:03:40] among the foolish but among the wise
[2:03:44] that hear the word and they go and do it
[2:03:48] isn't that your prayer let's bow our
[2:03:50] heads father God I thank you for this
[2:03:51] word yes I thank you Father that you
[2:03:55] sent a
[2:03:56] word and it heals the people but that
[2:04:01] word revealed in its season also brings
[2:04:03] the
[2:04:04] Judgment oh God how close are we we see
[2:04:11] hell has enlarged
[2:04:13] itself Spirits coming 200,000,000 demons
[2:04:18] released out into this world yes and
[2:04:22] they in the world are doing The Works of
[2:04:25] their
[2:04:26] father he was a murderer a liar a
[2:04:30] deceiver in the beginning his people
[2:04:34] will do the same but father there is a
[2:04:37] voice in this last day a voice of a
[2:04:40] seventh angel who said come out from
[2:04:43] among them and be ye separate Lord God
[2:04:47] wants you separate he don't want you to
[2:04:49] look like them to act like like them to
[2:04:52] talk like
[2:04:54] them or to be like them in any way for
[2:04:58] if you love the world and the things of
[2:05:00] the world the love of God is not even in
[2:05:04] you father I thank you for your word I
[2:05:07] thank you for the Holy Spirit which
[2:05:10] brings
[2:05:11] conviction I thank you Father for the
[2:05:15] convicting power of the Holy Spirit
[2:05:18] among each one of us Lord that's still
[2:05:21] Small Voice that's encouraging
[2:05:25] us causing us to come up higher and yet
[2:05:30] father how many times have we crouched
[2:05:33] that little voice have we uh in some way
[2:05:38] as your Prophet said there are so many
[2:05:40] voices in this end time I doubt there'll
[2:05:44] be very few that will hear the true
[2:05:46] voice of God but we have confidence in
[2:05:50] this that and he that hath an
[2:05:54] ear let him
[2:05:56] hear what the spirit is saying unto the
[2:06:00] church I have confidence Lord that every
[2:06:03] elect seed here everyone
[2:06:06] predestinated to hear to be quickened by
[2:06:09] this voice in the end time and when
[2:06:12] they're
[2:06:14] quickened the administration is changing
[2:06:17] from one
[2:06:18] voice to a voice of many Waters yes Lord
[2:06:23] and they under the administration and
[2:06:27] the anointing of the end time voice they
[2:06:30] add their voices together and they under
[2:06:34] that Prophet
[2:06:36] become the final
[2:06:41] voice to the final
[2:06:44] age this is the
[2:06:47] final
[2:06:49] chapter he said
[2:06:52] there'll be no historians need to write
[2:06:55] the history because there'll be no one
[2:06:57] here to read
[2:06:59] it father we know you're
[2:07:02] closing the chapters of
[2:07:05] humanity and everything that you're
[2:07:08] Bible said would come to pass has either
[2:07:12] come to pass or is in the process of
[2:07:15] coming to pass father I thank you and I
[2:07:18] love you and I thank you for or
[2:07:22] conviction that comes upon each heart
[2:07:25] where we see our faults our
[2:07:27] failures let us then be quick to say I'm
[2:07:31] wrong that's why King David was a man
[2:07:34] after your own heart not because he was
[2:07:36] without sin not because he didn't commit
[2:07:40] murder adultery and all of those things
[2:07:43] that's not like you God that's
[2:07:46] man but when he was corrected by a
[2:07:50] prophet and told him said David you're
[2:07:52] that
[2:07:53] man David became under Judgment of his
[2:07:56] own words that man is worthy of
[2:08:00] death and yet he turned around and he
[2:08:03] cried oh God have
[2:08:05] mercy father that's what we do that's
[2:08:08] what we've done this morning we saw I'm
[2:08:11] that man I'm the
[2:08:14] one I'm why you went to
[2:08:17] Calvary I'm why you sent a prophet I'm
[2:08:21] why you did all these things and I judge
[2:08:24] myself father let us not judge others
[2:08:29] lest we be judged but let us judge
[2:08:31] ourselves
[2:08:33] righteously father I thank you and I
[2:08:36] love
[2:08:38] you I thank you that we have an advocate
[2:08:41] before the
[2:08:42] father that when we do things
[2:08:45] wrong then we are convicted in our heart
[2:08:48] we say father forgive me
[2:08:51] put it in the sea of its
[2:08:54] forgetfulness never to be brought up
[2:08:57] again Lord oh Father I thank
