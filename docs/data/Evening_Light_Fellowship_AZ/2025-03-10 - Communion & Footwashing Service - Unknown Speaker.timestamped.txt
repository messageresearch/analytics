[45:44] uh it's the reminds me of the last
[45:48] supper with the Lord
[45:50] Jesus the same night in which he was
[45:52] betrayed took
[45:54] bread it was the last time that he was
[45:57] with the 12 to
[45:59] together was the last
[46:01] time that he actually preached a sermon
[46:04] with
[46:06] him until he was
[46:09] betrayed brother Brandon preaches
[46:11] communion and goes off of the
[46:14] scene but he told us that the very next
[46:18] thing that we're going to do when we get
[46:19] to
[46:21] heaven said we're going to take
[46:23] communion
[46:25] amen hallelujah
[46:28] amen for even Jesus said I will not
[46:31] drink of the vine until that day
[46:34] come praise the Lord oh I I love those

[46:51] quickly this might be the day it might
[46:53] be the last hour we don't know with all
[46:56] of the
[46:58] signs and all of the flashing red
[47:02] lights and all of the prophecies being
[47:05] fulfilled all around us how much longer
[47:08] do we
[47:09] have I don't know but I know this that
[47:13] we'll be keeping on until he
[47:17] comes amen I would like us to stand and
[47:20] sing only believe I've got the brothers
[47:23] to go ahead for those of you that have
[47:25] perhaps uh
[47:27] your your tablet or your iPad or your
[47:31] cell phone and you have the table there
[47:34] on it and you want to follow along the
[47:36] rest of you will be doing it up here on
[47:38] the
[47:39] [Music]
[47:41] overhead but what was the real reason
[47:43] why God sent Malachi
[47:52] 4 he says God has sent
[47:55] me to pre preached to you a sermon and
[47:58] he gave me two signs to get your
[48:03] attention it's not the signs that cause
[48:06] you to
[48:08] believe but it was the word it was the
[48:11] voice behind the
[48:13] sign no man ever spake like this
[48:19] [Music]
[48:20] man and he says every time you sing this
[48:24] song let your mind go back
[48:27] and think and be grateful that God has
[48:31] allowed
[48:32] you and given you eyes to see and ears
[48:36] to hear those things that were
[48:39] prophesied in this end time thank you
[48:42] Lord so let's take a
[48:44] moment and let's just thank God and
[48:47] let's sing only
[48:49] believe yes
[48:52] only be
[48:59] all
[49:03] be all things are
[49:10] possible
[49:12] only
[49:16] believe
[49:18] only
[49:21] [Music]
[49:22] be
[49:24] only be
[49:28] [Music]
[49:30] all things are
[49:35] possible
[49:38] only believe God bless you you can be
[49:41] seated for a moment Brethren are you
[49:44] ready with the tap all right God bless
[49:47] you as we listen to God's servant
[49:48] Prophet brother
[49:55] brandom now if we would say the
[49:58] communion should just be taken the word
[50:01] I don't believe anyone has a right to
[50:03] take the Lord's Supper until he's taken
[50:05] the the word of the Lord into his heart
[50:08] see because I'm going I'll read
[50:09] something for you in a few moments and
[50:11] you'll see now notice then why then
[50:17] would we we would on the same basis we
[50:19] could absolutely justify the Salvation
[50:21] Army they do not believe in any form of
[50:24] water baptism that we don't need need
[50:27] it now if we don't need water baptism
[50:30] why are we baptized so well water can't
[50:32] save you the blood saves you I'll agree
[50:34] with that amen that's right the blood
[50:36] saves you not the water but we must take
[50:39] the water as an outward emotion that an
[50:42] inward work of Grace has been
[50:44] done so must we own communion when we
[50:48] have taken the Lord our sacrifice into
[50:51] us as a matter of spiritual birth into
[50:55] us and his body body we live by him by
[50:58] the word we also should symbolize it
[51:01] because it's a commandment repent every
[51:03] one of you and be baptized in the name
[51:05] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[51:07] your sins Paul said I have received of
[51:10] the Lord that which I also delivered
[51:12] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[51:14] night which is betrayed took bread and
[51:15] break it and gave it to the disciples
[51:17] and and said Take and Eat This do uh in
[51:20] rembrance of me for as often as you take
[51:22] this bread you show forth his death till
[51:24] he comes now we found out that in that
[51:28] they had people who come and this
[51:30] precious brother very dear brother he
[51:33] came and he said I never I never did
[51:35] take it brother Braham I don't
[51:36] understand what it is I've been taught
[51:38] the other side I said but remember we
[51:41] will admit that St Paul set it in order
[51:44] in the early Christian Church they went
[51:47] from church from house to house broke
[51:49] the bread singles to the heart and so
[51:51] forth now I said he did put it in the
[51:53] church Galatians 1:8 he said if an angel
[51:56] from heaven comes and says anything else
[51:58] let it be a cursed see amen the same one
[52:01] had him to be rebap tized again from the
[52:04] uh baptism of John to be baptized in the
[52:07] name of Jesus Christ you see there are
[52:10] three things that we must three things
[52:12] that we must do assembl Lord's Supper
[52:15] feet washing water baptism see there's
[52:18] he said well the now the uh Salvation
[52:21] Army takes it from the point the dying
[52:23] Thief when he died he wasn't baptized
[52:25] yet Jesus said he'd be in heaven that's
[52:28] exactly the truth that's exactly but you
[52:31] see he he he only recognized Jesus right
[52:34] there in an hour he was dying see that's
[52:36] the only that's the only opportunity he
[52:38] had he he's a thief he's a away he's out
[52:40] and he as soon as he seen that life he
[52:43] recognized it Lord remember me and Jesus
[52:46] that was true but to you and I who know
[52:49] that we should B be baptized and refuse
[52:52] to do it then that'll be between you and
[52:54] God Amen same thing in communion now
[52:57] when we take this communion it isn't
[52:59] just the things say have come up here
[53:00] and go to eat some bread and I believe
[53:03] I'm a Christian but if you notice the
[53:05] Bible said he that eateth and drinketh
[53:08] unworthily shall be guilty of the blood
[53:11] and the body of the
[53:13] Lord you've got to live a life that that
[53:17] before the people that and before God
[53:19] and the people that shows that you are
[53:22] that you are sincere uh just a moment
[53:25] longer
[53:27] now in the Old Testament when the
[53:31] sacrifice was uh made um a statue or an
[53:37] ordinance and so is water baptism an
[53:40] ordinance so is feet woring an ordinance
[53:44] amen so is the Lord's Supper an
[53:46] ordinance amen blessed is he who does
[53:48] all of his ordinance keeps all of his
[53:50] statutes all of his Commandments that he
[53:52] might have a right to enter into the
[53:54] tree of life now notice listen this now
[53:57] that in that first when it was first an
[54:00] ordinance of God to bring a sacrifice to
[54:03] the church and uh to the temple and the
[54:06] Altar and offer your gift and uh for
[54:08] your sins the sacrifice of a lamb I can
[54:12] just imagine seeing some Jewish brother
[54:15] coming down the road knowing that he was
[54:17] guilty and he goes to the altar or
[54:19] brings his fat Ox a block or whatever he
[54:23] had or Ram lamb something brought it
[54:26] down the road just as sincere as he
[54:29] could come he walked up there keeping
[54:33] God's ordinance just as sincerely as he
[54:35] could then he laid his hands up on it
[54:38] confessing his sins the priest placing
[54:41] this his sins upon the lamb and the
[54:44] Lamb's throat was cut and uh and then
[54:47] died for him as he laid there the little
[54:50] lamb kicking and bleeding his hands
[54:52] being full of blood and flying all over
[54:54] him the little lamb blatant and dying he
[54:57] would realize that he had sinned and
[55:00] something had to die in his place
[55:03] therefore he was offering this Lamb's
[55:06] death for his death see the lamb died in
[55:09] his place then a man done it with
[55:13] sincerity with deepness of his heart
[55:16] finally over and over it went again over
[55:20] and over it kept going until finally it
[55:23] become a tradition
[55:26] the Commandment of God became a
[55:28] tradition to the people and then here he
[55:32] come down well let's see this is so and
[55:33] so day maybe I'll better go down yeah I
[55:35] better offer Bullock he went out well
[55:38] Lord here's my Bullock see there's no
[55:40] sincerity in it there's no understanding
[55:43] to it now we don't want to take
[55:45] communion like that that's the same
[55:48] thing has become to the Lord's table
[55:51] Isaiah uh 35 no I beg your pardon Isaiah
[55:54] 6
[55:56] let me take that back I I I believe it's
[55:59] Isaiah 28 is where we find this I'm
[56:03] pretty sure that's the right chapter he
[56:05] said precept must be upon precept and
[56:07] line upon line upon line here a little
[56:09] there a little hold Fai to that what's
[56:11] good for stammer lips other tongues will
[56:13] I speak to this people and this is the
[56:15] rest he said all the tables of the Lord
[56:18] has become full of
[56:20] vomits who can I teach Doctrine who can
[56:23] I make to understand see I think that
[56:26] was right scripture Isaiah 20 who can I
[56:29] make understand Doctrine see the tables
[56:31] now we find out today that this great
[56:34] thing that we're fixing to do tonight in
[56:37] commemoration of his death and his body
[56:40] that we believe that we eat daily or
[56:43] just got through eating as our brother
[56:45] preached to us taking the word of God we
[56:47] believe it with all of our heart we sit
[56:50] manifested we see it given to us we see
[56:53] it Vindicated we feel it in our lives
[56:55] and we must come to this with a deep
[56:58] conscience of what we're doing not just
[57:00] because it's an order you go into church
[57:03] and many times they get out an old soy
[57:05] cracker or some kind of a something
[57:07] break it up in light bread or something
[57:10] and and break it up and people who smoke
[57:13] drink everything else because they're a
[57:15] member of the church they come and take
[57:17] the Lord's Supper well that's filthiness
[57:21] before God even the sacrifice that your
[57:24] holy days and your sacrifice become a
[57:26] Sten him un no yet he ordained them to
[57:30] make that sacrifice but the way they
[57:32] treated it it become a
[57:34] Sten stink in his nose his nostrils the
[57:38] very sacrifice that he
[57:41] ordained that's the way we take the word
[57:43] of God too many Christians today so-call
[57:46] does that we stand up here and teach
[57:49] this word and say Jesus Christ isn't the
[57:51] same yesterday today and forever and
[57:53] teach the things that he promised us
[57:55] that he would
[57:56] honor and say all was for something else
[58:00] our Sodom worships if become a stink in
[58:02] his nose he will not receive it by no
[58:06] means that's Reason by our traditional
[58:09] habits you don't take the Lord's Supper
[58:12] by tradition you take it because it's
[58:14] the love of God in your heart and
[58:16] keeping the Commandments of God see
[58:18] that's what you take it for so if you
[58:21] don't take it in sincerity just it's a
[58:23] tradition well our church observes Comm
[58:26] communion once every Sunday or once
[58:28] every month or twice the year and you go
[58:31] up say well it's my time take the
[58:33] communion why it's a stink to God see
[58:37] that's just a
[58:38] [Music]
[58:40] tradition even like anything else you
[58:43] you've got to be sincere God wants the
[58:46] depths of your heart you remember the
[58:48] very God that brought you here on Earth
[58:50] is the one you're
[58:52] serving you're doing this because he
[58:54] said so because because it's his order
[58:57] then we want to come up with deepness
[59:00] sincerity knowing that by God's grace
[59:04] that we have been saved and we we love
[59:07] him and we feel his presence and we we
[59:09] sit uh change our lives our our whole
[59:13] being is
[59:14] changed we we we're different people we
[59:17] don't live like we used to we don't
[59:19] think like we used to like in the book
[59:22] here and a spot there was talk about the
[59:25] the two books being W The Book of Life
[59:28] The First Book of Life coming up was
[59:30] when you were born that was your natural
[59:33] bird but then one time way back down in
[59:37] there there was a little grain of life
[59:38] as I was explained to some of the young
[59:41] sisters at the house this afternoon see
[59:43] there's a little grain of life in there
[59:45] that you'd wonder where did it come from
[59:48] what what these strange things I saying
[59:51] is taken for myself like it's going to
[59:53] say William Brandon well 40 years ago go
[59:56] the William Brandon this is the same one
[59:58] tonight somebody back there say William
[1:00:00] BR he was a rank
[1:00:03] Rascal because I was born of Charles and
[1:00:06] Ella brand in that nature I was a sinner
[1:00:10] I came to the world of liar and all the
[1:00:14] habits of the world laid right in me but
[1:00:16] down in there too was another nature
[1:00:21] present
[1:00:24] predestinated is in there God in this
[1:00:27] same
[1:00:29] body two Natures in there well I only
[1:00:33] cater to one is it grow a good as the
[1:00:36] baby that ey first thing you know become
[1:00:38] a liar become everything else that's a
[1:00:41] sinner because I raised up that way but
[1:00:43] down in there was a little speck of Life
[1:00:45] all the
[1:00:46] time I used to remember as a little
[1:00:49] boy I hope I'm not holding you too long
[1:00:52] but going uh sitting out in the on on
[1:00:56] the creek Bank i' sit there and look
[1:00:58] around at night time pop and Mom they're
[1:01:00] gone on out to their
[1:01:02] rest and them days they were Sinners
[1:01:05] there's no Christianity in our homes at
[1:01:07] all and all my drinking and parties and
[1:01:10] carrying on it made me sick I'd take my
[1:01:14] my Lantern and my dog and go up the
[1:01:17] woods to stay all night in the winter
[1:01:19] time on Hunt till the party was over
[1:01:22] maybe daylight in the morning come home
[1:01:24] wouldn't be over I've late on time top
[1:01:26] of a shed and sleep waiting for daylight
[1:01:28] to break then i' think of uh how that
[1:01:32] times then being out there in the
[1:01:35] summertime get my sticks and putle down
[1:01:38] for a little wind break or if it rain
[1:01:41] leave there and have a pole sticking in
[1:01:43] a water fishing my old crew dog laying
[1:01:47] there I'd say look at here you know last
[1:01:52] winter I camped right here one night I
[1:01:55] build a fire right here when I was
[1:01:56] waiting for my old dog here to to treat
[1:01:59] and uh I had a fire here it was froze 5
[1:02:02] in deep in the
[1:02:04] ground that little fire where did you
[1:02:07] come
[1:02:10] from where did you come from Who come
[1:02:13] out here and planted you and what hot
[1:02:16] house did they bring you out of or what
[1:02:18] about where didd you come from see that
[1:02:21] little flower said well it was frozen
[1:02:24] everything and I build a fire on top
[1:02:25] here besides the freezing element there
[1:02:28] was a heat element L here on the big old
[1:02:30] W I burn here and yet here you are
[1:02:32] you're
[1:02:34] alive where'd you come from what was it
[1:02:37] there was another William Brown he a
[1:02:41] little spot of eternal life down there
[1:02:43] from the the the jeans of God the word
[1:02:48] of God that was placed in there each one
[1:02:50] of you can think of similar things it
[1:02:52] was working now look up the trees I
[1:02:55] think Le I've seen you fall off last
[1:02:58] year and why you back there again where
[1:03:00] did you come from what brought you here
[1:03:04] see it was that eternal life working
[1:03:09] in the
[1:03:11] body now then one day as I walked on
[1:03:15] that voice talking don't never smoke
[1:03:17] drink so forth the young Fells I got
[1:03:20] older see there was something moving but
[1:03:22] yet all that once I looked up I said I'm
[1:03:27] not the son of Charles and El
[1:03:30] Brandon there's something call like my
[1:03:33] little
[1:03:34] Eagle I'm not a chicken Hallelujah
[1:03:37] there's something up y somewhere GL oh
[1:03:40] great Jehovah whoever you are open up I
[1:03:43] want to come home there's something in
[1:03:46] me calling then I was born again that
[1:03:51] little life was laying there the life of
[1:03:53] water was poured up on it then it begin
[1:03:55] toow
[1:03:56] now that old life was forgiven put in
[1:04:00] the sea of God's forgetfulness to Never
[1:04:02] Be Remembered against me no more now we
[1:04:06] stand Justified as though we never had
[1:04:08] sin in the presence of God then when we
[1:04:12] come to the Lord's table we must come in
[1:04:15] reverence love and respect of look where
[1:04:18] we would have been if it hadn't been for
[1:04:21] him look where it would been therefore
[1:04:24] Paul I think in s it
[1:04:26] orfor when you come together to eat hay
[1:04:30] one for the other that is other words
[1:04:32] just wait a few minutes pray check
[1:04:36] yourself out and if you know a brother's
[1:04:38] in there just about to do something
[1:04:40] that's wrong or something uh you pray
[1:04:43] for him too see carry one the other wait
[1:04:48] just a minute pray there's any feelings
[1:04:50] between you or something don't don't do
[1:04:53] don't do it go make that right first see
[1:04:56] go straighten that up first because we
[1:04:57] want to come here just as pure as we can
[1:05:00] be in our thoughts of one another and to
[1:05:04] God and to each other and then we come
[1:05:07] in Fellowship around the table of the
[1:05:11] Lord see and we do this because that we
[1:05:14] are giving thanks to him and among one
[1:05:18] another eating the bread between each
[1:05:21] other drinking the wine between each
[1:05:22] other as his blood and his flesh
[1:05:26] except you eat the Flesh of the son of
[1:05:28] man and drink his blood you have no life
[1:05:31] in you see you see that's what the Bible
[1:05:35] says except you do it there's no life
[1:05:38] you see you are then more or less shown
[1:05:42] you are
[1:05:43] ashamed to identify yourself as a
[1:05:48] Christian because of the life that you
[1:05:50] live and then this is really The
[1:05:53] Showdown then if you don't do it
[1:05:56] you have no life if you do do it
[1:05:58] unworthily you're guilty of the body of
[1:06:01] the Lord same thing in water baptism if
[1:06:05] we say we believe on Jesus Christ he
[1:06:07] saved us from sin and we're baptized in
[1:06:09] the name of Jesus Christ while we bring
[1:06:13] we bring disgrace to him we do the
[1:06:17] things that's wrong and we we have to
[1:06:20] pay for that and another thing when we
[1:06:22] do that we are trying to prep confess
[1:06:26] one thing and do another that's the
[1:06:28] trouble of us today what I think I'm
[1:06:31] saying us me and the church that the
[1:06:34] Lord God has let me speak to in these
[1:06:37] last
[1:06:38] hours that we believe we're in the
[1:06:40] closing time we believe that God has
[1:06:43] given us a
[1:06:44] message it's been ordained of God it's
[1:06:48] been proven of God it's been short of
[1:06:50] God now we must come to him with
[1:06:53] reverence
[1:06:55] with love and with with purity of heart
[1:06:59] and mind and
[1:07:00] soul you know the hour should arise when
[1:07:04] when right among us there be the holy
[1:07:06] spirit will speak out like it did in
[1:07:08] Anon and S amen see that hour is
[1:07:13] arriving see and we are now you just
[1:07:16] remember that see that God is going to
[1:07:20] dwell among his people that's what he
[1:07:22] wants to do now we can receive the
[1:07:25] message as saying if I was a young man
[1:07:29] hunting for a wife and I could find a
[1:07:31] wife I said she's just perfect she's a
[1:07:33] Christian she's a lady she's all this I
[1:07:35] Got Confidence no matter how much
[1:07:37] confidence how much I think she's nice
[1:07:39] I've got to receive her she's got to
[1:07:42] receive me see upon these vows what's
[1:07:45] the same thing we find in the message we
[1:07:48] see it's right we see God vindicates
[1:07:51] it's right it's perfectly right year
[1:07:53] after year year after year continues
[1:07:55] right continues right everything it says
[1:07:57] happen just exactly the way he said now
[1:07:59] we know it's right but see don't do it
[1:08:02] from an inter lecture standpoint if you
[1:08:05] do you got a second-handed
[1:08:09] religion we don't want a second-handed
[1:08:11] religion something that somebody else
[1:08:13] has experienced and we are living off of
[1:08:16] of their testimony as I believe it was
[1:08:20] Jesus said to Pilot uh uh something a
[1:08:23] word I was thinking he said there just a
[1:08:26] few moments ago uh who told you that or
[1:08:28] was it revealed to you how did you know
[1:08:31] these things in other words I don't know
[1:08:33] what the word is now it's been a long
[1:08:35] time since read but how did you how did
[1:08:37] you know this what how who reveal this
[1:08:39] to you about him being the Son of God
[1:08:41] who revealed you did some man tell you
[1:08:44] that or as Jesus said is it my Father in
[1:08:48] Heaven which has revealed it to you see
[1:08:52] how did you learn it a second hand or is
[1:08:54] it a perfect Revelation from God is this
[1:08:59] communion just something I go up for an
[1:09:00] order say well the rest of them take yes
[1:09:02] I will too it's a revelation am that I
[1:09:07] am part of him and I'm part of you I
[1:09:10] love you and I love him and we're taking
[1:09:12] this together as a symbol of our love to
[1:09:16] God and our love and fellowship to one
[1:09:19] another now I want to read some from the
[1:09:22] scripture and then I guess we
[1:09:25] whichever way brother Perry desires
[1:09:27] today I wish you'd read it with me if
[1:09:29] you got your Bible First Corinthians the
[1:09:32] U the 11 chapter and begin with the 23rd
[1:09:37] verse and then also at our Tabernacle
[1:09:41] we've always observe this and feet
[1:09:43] washing always because they go hand in
[1:09:46] hand together I believe the brother
[1:09:47] announced it Wednesday night because of
[1:09:49] the crowds and don't have enough to uh
[1:09:51] room to get the people in for feet
[1:09:53] washing we go obser observe this
[1:09:55] Wednesday night now 23rd verse of the
[1:09:59] 11th chapter of First Corinthians listen
[1:10:01] at Paul now now remember keep this in
[1:10:04] mind Galatians 1: 18 if we are an angel
[1:10:08] from heaven preaches any other gospel
[1:10:10] unto you then this gospel that he had
[1:10:13] preached let him be
[1:10:16] cursed for I have received of the Lord
[1:10:19] that which I also delivered unto you
[1:10:22] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:10:24] which he was betrayed took
[1:10:27] bread and when he gave thanks he break
[1:10:29] it said Take and Eat This is my body
[1:10:32] which is broken for you this do in
[1:10:35] remembrance of me now let me stop right
[1:10:38] here to say but taking the body of the
[1:10:42] Lord Jesus Christ in this communion does
[1:10:45] not mean that that
[1:10:47] communion is the literal Body of Christ
[1:10:51] that's
[1:10:52] Catholic I do not believe that that's
[1:10:55] right I believe it's only an ordinance
[1:10:57] that God made with us that's right see
[1:11:00] it isn't an actual body it's not it's
[1:11:03] really a little piece of kosher bread
[1:11:05] that's right it's just an ordinance
[1:11:08] neither do I believe that the baptism of
[1:11:11] Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:11:14] and water does forgive your
[1:11:17] sins I do not believe it I be you could
[1:11:20] be baptized all day long now I know that
[1:11:22] there's perhaps people sitting here who
[1:11:24] come from
[1:11:25] Apostolic church I mean or the United
[1:11:28] Pentecostal Church which they teach that
[1:11:31] but you see I I do not believe that the
[1:11:34] water forgives sins or if it was then
[1:11:37] Jesus died in vain amen see I believe it
[1:11:41] it's only an ordinance of God see to
[1:11:44] show that you have been forgiven but to
[1:11:47] be baptized for regeneration no I I I
[1:11:50] don't believe I don't believe that water
[1:11:52] forgive sins NE I believe that this
[1:11:54] bread and and wine
[1:11:56] has anything to do with you only keeping
[1:11:58] an ordinance that God has ordained for
[1:12:00] us to do see that's try to be water
[1:12:03] baptism is the same thing I believe it's
[1:12:05] compelling to us to do it that he had
[1:12:07] done it all for our example and he done
[1:12:09] this for our example and he washed feet
[1:12:11] for our
[1:12:12] example
[1:12:14] now after the same manner also 25th
[1:12:17] verse after the same manner also he took
[1:12:20] the cup and when he accept saying this
[1:12:24] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[1:12:28] this do ye as of as you drink it in
[1:12:31] remembrance of me far as off remember
[1:12:35] now far as off as you eat this bread and
[1:12:40] drink this cup you do sh forth the
[1:12:43] Lord's death till he comes how
[1:12:47] long until he come
[1:12:50] amen wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:12:54] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:12:57] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:13:00] and the blood of the Lord let me stop
[1:13:02] just a minute the reason he said this
[1:13:04] you notice in another verse here another
[1:13:06] chapter that he said I understand when
[1:13:08] you when you come together you're eating
[1:13:12] even getting drunk at the Lord's table
[1:13:14] they misunderstood it you see they just
[1:13:17] glutted in see just like people are
[1:13:19] doing today just live any kind of life
[1:13:21] and take it see he said you got homes to
[1:13:24] eat in see but this is an ordinance that
[1:13:28] we should keep seeing now but let a man
[1:13:32] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:13:34] the bread and drink of the cup for he
[1:13:37] that eateth and drinketh
[1:13:39] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:13:42] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:13:46] body what are you you're a Christian
[1:13:49] amen you live before everybody as a
[1:13:52] Christian and if you take that and don't
[1:13:55] live as a Christian you're not
[1:13:57] Discerning the Lord's body you're
[1:13:58] putting a stum and block in somebody
[1:14:00] else's way see as they see you trying to
[1:14:02] do that and they're not living what
[1:14:04] you're supposed to live see you're not
[1:14:05] Discerning the Lord's body now watch
[1:14:08] what what the curse of it is for this CA
[1:14:11] many are weak and sickly among you and
[1:14:13] many are asleep the right translation of
[1:14:15] that word brother per is dead that's
[1:14:18] right see many of De for if we for if we
[1:14:24] would judge ourselves we should not be
[1:14:28] judged that's
[1:14:29] right we judge ourselves we won't be
[1:14:33] judged but when we are judged we're
[1:14:36] chastened out the Lord that we should
[1:14:38] not be condemned with the world see not
[1:14:42] any attached to the world wherefore my
[1:14:44] brethren when you come together to eat t
[1:14:48] one for the other see and if any man
[1:14:51] hunger let him eat at home
[1:14:55] that you come not together unto
[1:14:58] condemnation and the rest I will set in
[1:15:01] order when I come see now in other words
[1:15:05] don't just come to take it as a as I
[1:15:08] said a while ago about what the Jews
[1:15:10] their sacrifice they it was wonderful
[1:15:12] it's given by God but it got to a place
[1:15:15] where they didn't do it in sincerity and
[1:15:17] in reverence and in order then it become
[1:15:19] just a it become a a stench in his nose
[1:15:23] now the same thing is by are coming to
[1:15:26] take the Lord's Supper amen that we must
[1:15:29] come knowing what we are doing just like
[1:15:32] when you go into the water to be
[1:15:34] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:15:36] know what you're doing you're putting on
[1:15:39] to the
[1:15:40] church what God has put in you
[1:15:45] Christ when we take this it shows to the
[1:15:48] church that I believe every word of
[1:15:51] God I believe that he is the bread of
[1:15:54] life that comfor godone Out of Heaven I
[1:15:57] believe every word that he says is the
[1:15:59] truth and I live by to the best of my
[1:16:02] knowledge God being my
[1:16:04] judge therefore before my brothers
[1:16:07] before my sisters I I do not swear I do
[1:16:10] not curse I do not do these things
[1:16:12] because I love the Lord and the Lord
[1:16:14] knows that bears me record therefore
[1:16:17] before you I take the par of his body to
[1:16:20] know that I'm not condemned with the
[1:16:21] world see there you are then it's a
[1:16:24] blessing
[1:16:25] and remember I could give many
[1:16:27] testimonies on this where I tuck that
[1:16:29] and explained it in a sick room that's
[1:16:32] right and seen him heal that's right
[1:16:36] remember when Israel taken the type of
[1:16:39] this they journeyed 40 years in the
[1:16:42] wilderness and their clothes never even
[1:16:44] wore out and they come out without one
[1:16:46] feeble among one among them with two
[1:16:48] million people as a type of this or what
[1:16:52] would the antitype do if the body of a
[1:16:55] sacrificial animal did that for them
[1:16:58] what would the body of Jesus Christ
[1:17:00] Emmanuel do for
[1:17:03] us let's us being rever when we come let
[1:17:07] us be just as Reverend as we know how to
[1:17:22] come amen
[1:17:26] you know he was talking about reverence
[1:17:29] and
[1:17:31] sincerity and I want
[1:17:33] to take a moment to speak to all of you
[1:17:36] that during the time of
[1:17:38] our uh foot washing it's just become a
[1:17:42] little bit where we're talking too
[1:17:46] much can we go into it in reverence and
[1:17:49] sincerity
[1:17:51] amen amen I I think you you lose a a a
[1:17:54] great blessing when you just go to
[1:17:57] chatting and talking about things you
[1:17:59] know there's many times when I walk
[1:18:01] around I'm hugging a Brother's
[1:18:03] neck and I'm praying for different ones
[1:18:06] different ones said brother Ron pray for
[1:18:08] me and I'm here praying and the
[1:18:10] brother's just three four feet away or
[1:18:13] talking and there's nothing wrong with
[1:18:15] that I just think we want to give this
[1:18:18] time
[1:18:19] reverence and
[1:18:21] sincerity and just keep it down and you
[1:18:24] know I I don't mean that you can't say
[1:18:26] anything you know but uh let's just be
[1:18:30] reverent and sincere so if the Brethren
[1:18:34] will come
[1:18:35] now if they would we're going to go
[1:18:37] ahead and take
[1:18:39] communion so
[1:18:42] if you Brethren come forward they
[1:18:46] brother Michel said brother Ron you
[1:18:47] don't need to wear a pair of
[1:18:51] gloves he said everybody watches you and
[1:18:55] you scratch your face go in your ear or
[1:18:57] something like
[1:18:59] that you got your glove
[1:19:03] on
[1:19:04] so I just believe that God will keep
[1:19:09] us I've always had a wonderful time of
[1:19:15] communion and I certainly want to say to
[1:19:19] all of you that I feel
[1:19:21] honored to be a pastor
[1:19:26] of
[1:19:27] such a
[1:19:30] people like
[1:19:32] yourselves oh
[1:19:34] I I I just want to say that I just
[1:19:37] believe we're some of the best amen I
[1:19:41] can't let me just boast on you a little
[1:19:44] bit I do I've been
[1:19:47] around quite a bit and I've been here
[1:19:49] and there oh we're not the shoust and
[1:19:52] we're not the best singers and this and
[1:19:54] that and uh but you know what the
[1:19:58] sincerity of the people here at our
[1:20:01] church many people come and say and
[1:20:04] ministers they even come here and say
[1:20:06] brother Ron wow it's so easy to preach
[1:20:09] to your people because they pull they
[1:20:12] desire to hear the word of God and I
[1:20:15] just want to say how proud I am of each
[1:20:17] and every one of you and
[1:20:21] having been your pastor for all these
[1:20:24] years
[1:20:25] Earth and I realize that God will hold
[1:20:28] me
[1:20:29] responsible I've got
[1:20:31] to preach it to you
[1:20:35] straight not to try to just soft soap it
[1:20:39] or however they say to cut the
[1:20:45] corners but preach it straight
[1:20:49] amen and uh so I just wanted to take a
[1:20:53] few moments there
[1:20:55] now brother Brenham went ahead and had
[1:20:58] read the the scriptures
[1:21:01] there and so I don't feel that I need to
[1:21:04] do that well I'm sorry I feel I do need
[1:21:08] to do that because it's us it's here
[1:21:11] right now is that okay with you
[1:21:26] for I have this is 1 Corinthians
[1:21:30] 11:23 for I have received of the Lord
[1:21:33] that which also I delivered unto
[1:21:35] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:21:38] in which he was betrayed took
[1:21:41] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:21:44] Breo it and said take eat this is my
[1:21:47] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:21:49] remembrance of
[1:21:51] me after the same manner also he took
[1:21:54] the cup and when he had SED saying this
[1:21:57] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[1:22:00] this do ye as of as you drink it in
[1:22:04] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:22:07] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:22:10] show the Lord's death till he
[1:22:12] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:22:15] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:22:17] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:22:20] and blood of the
[1:22:21] Lord but let a man examine himself self
[1:22:25] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:22:27] of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:22:30] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:22:33] Damnation to himself not
[1:22:36] Discerning the Lord's body and for this
[1:22:39] cause many are weak and sickly among
[1:22:42] you and many
[1:22:45] sleep if we should judge ourselves we
[1:22:48] should not be judged but when we are
[1:22:51] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[1:22:55] we should not be condemned with the
[1:22:57] world wherefore my brethren when you

[1:23:02] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:23:05] eat at home that you come not together

[1:40:35] 1-
[1:40:38] 17 now before the Feast of the
[1:40:42] Passover when Jesus knew that his hour
[1:40:45] was come that he should depart out of
[1:40:48] this world unto the
[1:40:51] father having loved his own which were
[1:40:53] in the
[1:40:54] world he loved them unto the
[1:41:00] end and supper being
