[33:35] was there when you dedicated the two or
[33:38] three buildings ago in your original
[33:39] evening Light Fellowship buildings in
[33:41] 1993 and here I am a couple years later

[33:50] raised 2 000 years ago he didn't just
[33:52] raise the beginning of this age but he's
[33:54] alive and raised again and each and
[33:56] every one of you and just think his
[33:59] undying love has made you undying
[34:02] [Music]
[34:14] sometimes it's the hardest thing ever to
[34:19] believe
[34:25] the mystery that's hiding there under
[34:29] the seventh sea
[34:32] [Music]
[34:36] you are my Adam and you made of me Yuri
[34:41] [Music]
[34:46] this time we won't have to leave hand in
[34:52] hand
[34:54] eternally
[34:57] this kind of love brought my God from
[35:03] eternal
[35:04] eternity
[35:07] sweat drops of blood as he prayed in
[35:12] guessing
[35:16] that in a day like today on the brink of
[35:21] the greatest
[35:24] Victory
[35:26] his
[35:27] Undying Love
[35:30] love would make me
[35:34] undying oh just think that his undying
[35:40] love has made me undies
[35:48] how could the king of glory ever choose
[35:51] to come and walk with me
[35:55] me
[35:58] to know he killed his son so that his
[36:01] blood would wash and make me clean
[36:07] I always read the story asking who would
[36:12] be the heroine
[36:18] him here on my knees I tremble seeing
[36:21] you're The King
[36:24] and I am the queen
[36:28] this kind of love brought my God from
[36:35] eternity
[36:37] just a wet drops of blood as he prayed
[36:42] in gas
[36:47] in a day like today on the brink of the
[36:52] greatest
[36:55] Victory
[36:56] is
[36:58] Undying Love
[37:01] would make me
[37:04] undies
[37:06] just think that his Undying Love
[37:11] has made me undying

[37:20] prepared a place for me

[55:03] why you sang it when you
[55:06] see the direction of my sermon
[55:10] because God starts lining things up
[55:15] he does it for a purpose because there
[55:18] is a channel
[55:19] Amen brother walner talks about the
[55:21] seventh seal
[55:23] and then brother Gregory talks about
[55:27] uh
[55:28] the the new name and being set free
[55:33] and we're alive because he's alive
[55:37] amen
[55:39] I do have a lot on my plate this morning
[55:42] but I have one thing that I'd like to
[55:44] share with you we have had some
[55:46] nominations of deacons and
[55:51] trustees and if those Deacon those new
[55:55] nominees brother Tim Hofer
[55:57] Brothers Zach Lovell is not here
[56:00] but Ethan Strayer as a trustee in
[56:03] Matthew vasaki if you guys will you
[56:07] Brethren will come forward now I'd like
[56:10] to introduce you here to the
[56:12] congregation they will be as nominees
[56:16] in their positive Duty for one year
[56:21] they'll see how it fits for them and
[56:24] we'll see how we fit to them
[56:27] and then a year from now we'll vote them
[56:30] in and ordain them
[56:32] brother Tim Hofer
[56:34] is going to be one of our Deacons
[56:38] and Zach Lovell I think he's over in
[56:40] Scotland right now
[56:42] so he's not here Ethan Strayer one of
[56:45] our trustees and brother Matthew vasaki
[56:49] so we want to welcome them and we want
[56:54] them to serve in the capacity that God
[56:58] has placed them in and all of you
[57:01] welcome them with a great Round of
[57:04] Applause
[57:05] God bless you thank you brother God
[57:07] bless you
[57:12] and I have also
[57:16] um
[57:17] I have asked brother Stephen McNeely to
[57:21] become my associate pastor
[57:31] amen
[57:33] foreign
[57:35] amen amen amen now the reason that I
[57:39] have done this is because as a church
[57:42] body in the event of whether the pastor
[57:46] um you know passes away or re retires or
[57:51] resigns or for whatever purpose all of
[57:53] the above
[57:55] um uh you would never as a church be
[57:59] left without somebody to kind of steer
[58:02] the ship and again at that time that
[58:05] doesn't automatically make him pastor
[58:08] that puts him in a position and I would
[58:11] say probably about a year later they
[58:13] would look and if it fits uh then there
[58:16] would be a voting if it doesn't fit well
[58:19] then uh you as the body will continue on
[58:23] with the deacons and different ones to
[58:27] stay in that position until God raises
[58:30] somebody up within that capacity so
[58:34] brother Stephen God bless you I told him
[58:36] I want him with me in the pre-service
[58:39] back there uh to and but I said it's not
[58:42] necessary for him to sit up here and he
[58:45] can go and sit with his wife now and
[58:46] help take care of the kids so anyway God
[58:50] bless you brother Stephen
[58:52] foreign
[58:53] [Applause]
[59:01] amen please be in prayer for our
[59:05] anniversary meetings brother Andreas
[59:07] ring and will be coming over from
[59:09] Germany to be here with us we've made
[59:12] that announcement and also we have a
[59:14] baptismal directly after service and as
[59:16] even as brother Robert has said if you
[59:19] are in question or if you have never
[59:21] settled that in your mind I want you to
[59:23] know now is the time I believe what God
[59:25] is doing now as he's compelling them to
[59:28] come in amen it's it's something that
[59:31] God is doing amen all right let's all
[59:34] stand together if we could the tomb now
[59:36] is empty the Stone's been rolled away I
[59:39] know we sang that before I just feel to
[59:42] to sing that okay the two

[1:00:24] now it's empty the soul is rolled away

[1:01:08] and every one we appreciate all of the
[1:01:10] gifts that God has placed within the
[1:01:12] body
[1:01:13] amen
[1:01:16] Luke
[1:01:18] 24 verses 1 through 12.
[1:01:22] how can you come on Easter Sunday and
[1:01:25] not talk about what happened on that
[1:01:28] first Easter
[1:01:30] you definitely
[1:01:32] but I don't want to leave it 2 000 years
[1:01:35] ago
[1:01:37] God help us to fast forward to see what
[1:01:40] God is doing now
[1:01:44] amen can you just imagine
[1:01:48] now they had walked with him
[1:01:51] heard him preach
[1:01:53] they have been baptized they've been
[1:01:55] preaching the gospel but their Messiah
[1:01:58] has been crucified
[1:02:06] they
[1:02:07] thought this was him
[1:02:11] but they watched him die
[1:02:16] it wasn't rehearsed in their minds that
[1:02:19] he said destroy this temple in three
[1:02:21] days I'll raise it up
[1:02:24] they didn't have all of this stuff in
[1:02:26] their mind all of the events were
[1:02:30] clouding their mind with unbelief
[1:02:37] but regardless of the unbelief of the
[1:02:40] hour
[1:02:41] God still fulfills his word
[1:02:47] Luke 24 verses 1 through 12.
[1:03:02] now upon the first day of the week very
[1:03:05] early in the morning
[1:03:07] they came unto the Sepulcher bringing
[1:03:10] the spices which they had prepared
[1:03:12] and certain others with them
[1:03:16] and they found the stone rolled away
[1:03:18] from the Sepulcher
[1:03:20] now stop there for just a moment because
[1:03:22] there was a guard set over the tomb
[1:03:25] it was sealed with a Roman seal
[1:03:30] so events are happening
[1:03:33] and these guys are coming to the tomb
[1:03:35] and here my
[1:03:38] the stones have been rolled away
[1:03:41] and they entered in and found not the
[1:03:43] body of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:46] and it came to pass as they were much
[1:03:48] perplexed they're about behold two men
[1:03:52] stood by them in shining garments
[1:03:55] and as they were afraid and bowed down
[1:03:58] their faces to the Earth they said unto
[1:04:01] them why seek ye the living among the
[1:04:04] Dead
[1:04:11] he is not here
[1:04:14] he is
[1:04:16] risen
[1:04:18] remember now he spake unto you when he
[1:04:21] was yet in Galilee saying the son of man
[1:04:23] must be delivered in the hands of sinful
[1:04:26] men and be crucified and the third day
[1:04:29] rise again now they are reiterating the
[1:04:32] prophecy that he spoke to them in
[1:04:35] Galilee
[1:04:37] trying to jog their memory
[1:04:39] of what has come to pass
[1:04:45] and they remembered his words and
[1:04:47] returned from the Sepulcher
[1:04:49] until all these things unto the eleven
[1:04:52] and to all the rest and it was Mary
[1:04:54] Magdalena and Joanna and Mary the mother
[1:04:57] of James and other women that were with
[1:04:59] them which stole these things unto the
[1:05:01] apostles
[1:05:03] and their words seem to them as Idol
[1:05:06] Tales
[1:05:08] yeah yeah
[1:05:12] and they believed them not
[1:05:17] then it Rose Peter and I like Peter
[1:05:22] I'm gonna check it out myself
[1:05:28] then arose Peter and ran unto the
[1:05:30] Sepulcher and stooping down
[1:05:33] and be held the linen clothes laid by
[1:05:35] themselves and departed
[1:05:38] wandering in himself at that which was
[1:05:42] come
[1:05:43] to pass
[1:05:45] may God add the blessing the reading of
[1:05:47] his word you may be seated this morning
[1:05:49] in the presence of God I would like to
[1:05:52] turn in to the Book of Mark read another
[1:05:55] portion of scripture
[1:06:00] Mark 16
[1:06:01] verses 1 through 14.
[1:06:08] and when the Sabbath was passed
[1:06:11] Mary Magdalena and Mary the mother of
[1:06:13] James in Salome
[1:06:15] and brought sweet spices that they might
[1:06:18] come and anoint him remember
[1:06:20] it was that because the Sabbath was come
[1:06:24] they had no time to bury him properly
[1:06:29] and very early in the morning first day
[1:06:31] of the week they came under the
[1:06:32] Sepulcher at the rising
[1:06:34] of the sun there's two sons Rising
[1:06:41] and they said among themselves who shall
[1:06:43] roll us away the Stone from the door of
[1:06:46] the Sepulcher and they looked and they
[1:06:48] saw the stone was rolled away
[1:06:52] for it was very great
[1:06:56] and entering into the Sepulcher they saw
[1:06:59] a young man stand sitting at the right
[1:07:02] side clothed in long white garment and
[1:07:04] they were afraided
[1:07:07] and they saith unto them be not afraid
[1:07:12] ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which was
[1:07:15] crucified
[1:07:17] he is risen he is not here
[1:07:21] behold the place where they laid him
[1:07:24] but go your way tell the disciples and
[1:07:27] Peter that goeth before you into Galilee
[1:07:30] there ye shall see him as he said unto
[1:07:33] you and they went out quickly and fled
[1:07:35] from the Sepulcher
[1:07:37] for they trembled and were amazed
[1:07:39] neither said they anything to any man
[1:07:42] for they were afraid
[1:07:46] now when Jesus was risen early the first
[1:07:49] day of the week he appeared first to
[1:07:51] Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast
[1:07:53] Seven Devils
[1:07:56] she went and told them
[1:08:00] that had been with him
[1:08:02] as they mourned and wept
[1:08:05] and they when they had heard that he was
[1:08:08] alive and had been seen of her
[1:08:12] believe not
[1:08:15] my
[1:08:18] what
[1:08:20] kind of carnal Minds can get so troubled
[1:08:25] by the situations
[1:08:29] that we have a tendency not to believe
[1:08:33] God is fulfilling his word
[1:08:35] and after he appeared in another form
[1:08:38] under two of them as they walked and
[1:08:40] went in the country and they went and
[1:08:42] told it under the residue neither
[1:08:44] believed they them
[1:08:48] afterward he peered unto the eleven as
[1:08:52] they said at Mead and upbraided them
[1:08:53] with their unbelieving Hardness of Heart
[1:08:57] because they believe not them
[1:09:00] which had seen him
[1:09:02] after he was
[1:09:04] risen
[1:09:06] may God bless this reading of his word
[1:09:09] this morning
[1:09:10] I would like to title my sermon this
[1:09:12] morning
[1:09:14] his Rising caused another Rising
[1:09:21] and I'd like to take a subject of the
[1:09:25] god Gene
[1:09:26] is the resurrection Factor
[1:09:29] in every elect seed
[1:09:38] praise the Lord Saints
[1:09:41] he is risen and because he lives I live
[1:09:49] it was 22 years ago today we preached
[1:09:52] our first online service back in
[1:09:56] Maryland
[1:09:59] was the first one and we preached it
[1:10:02] it was a first service on the internet
[1:10:03] and I titled it I am the resurrection
[1:10:07] the subject of knowing him and the power
[1:10:10] of his resurrection
[1:10:14] now this month I also want to bring to
[1:10:17] your attention how many of you know
[1:10:19] there's a solar eclipse that is taking
[1:10:23] place
[1:10:24] here during this time
[1:10:28] there was a solar eclipse
[1:10:31] during that first crucifixion and
[1:10:34] Resurrection
[1:10:36] there is a solar eclipse now
[1:10:39] that is taking place again brother
[1:10:42] Branham said signs in the heavens
[1:10:45] are declaring what is happening on Earth
[1:10:49] I will tie that together here in a
[1:10:51] little bit
[1:10:53] so we know that gross darkness is
[1:10:57] covering the Earth and gross Darkness
[1:10:59] the people
[1:11:01] the sign is showing you how this gross
[1:11:04] darkness and who would have ever thought
[1:11:07] that people
[1:11:08] within just a few years would not have
[1:11:11] any kind of a concept intellectual
[1:11:15] people scientists
[1:11:18] people with knowledge don't even know
[1:11:20] what a gender of a woman and a man is
[1:11:28] gross Darkness
[1:11:31] the Bible says in all those whose names
[1:11:34] were not written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:11:36] Life shall be deceived
[1:11:38] you're seeing that deception a gross
[1:11:41] Darkness
[1:11:42] covering the earth and the minds of the
[1:11:45] people
[1:11:47] have gotten so degraded so degenerated
[1:11:51] until sin and debauchery are all around
[1:11:55] us but I don't want you to to
[1:11:59] look on those things and let them
[1:12:03] trouble you
[1:12:04] for Jesus said these things must come to
[1:12:07] pass but look up
[1:12:09] for your Redemption draws nigh
[1:12:13] Hallelujah
[1:12:16] today is Easter Sunday
[1:12:20] and the world is taking time to
[1:12:23] acknowledge that there is an empty tomb
[1:12:25] in Jerusalem many churches and
[1:12:28] denominations are having plays
[1:12:31] they have Angels they have the tomb and
[1:12:34] the disciples and the whole thing and
[1:12:36] many people are brought the resurrection
[1:12:40] as an uh entertainment as though it was
[1:12:44] just an event from over 2 000 years ago
[1:12:48] but may I say this I don't want to leave
[1:12:52] him 2 000 years ago
[1:12:55] because when he rose
[1:12:58] there's another Rising because when they
[1:13:01] had Rises the body follows
[1:13:05] are you with me
[1:13:07] so it's not that we worship a historical
[1:13:11] event
[1:13:15] brother Branham said it was the greatest
[1:13:17] event in history
[1:13:20] it was greater than the creation
[1:13:23] it was greater than the crucifixion
[1:13:33] he paid the price
[1:13:36] at Calvary
[1:13:39] he was a man that was crucified
[1:13:43] he was a man when they drove the nails
[1:13:47] into his hand
[1:13:49] he was a man that cried out Eli Eli Lama
[1:13:53] Suboxone
[1:13:55] my God why have you forsaken me he was a
[1:13:59] man when he said it is finished
[1:14:03] but on the third day he was more than a
[1:14:07] man
[1:14:09] he was God himself I came from God I go
[1:14:13] back to God
[1:14:15] amen
[1:14:19] the resurrection is the single most
[1:14:22] prominent important event in all of
[1:14:25] Christianity
[1:14:29] and it separates our religion from all
[1:14:32] of the other religions of the world
[1:14:36] because when he arose on that first
[1:14:39] morning
[1:14:40] he proved who he said he was
[1:14:44] brother Graham said in greatest news
[1:14:46] flash in history
[1:14:48] so it was a great time them glorious 40
[1:14:51] days
[1:14:53] how I would have loved to have been
[1:14:55] there
[1:14:56] but then thinking again that I'd have
[1:14:59] had to have been a believer
[1:15:01] because he did not appear to no one but
[1:15:04] is elected Church
[1:15:07] he only appears to believers
[1:15:11] and as he was then
[1:15:14] he cannot change
[1:15:16] today he only appears to his elected
[1:15:20] Church Believers
[1:15:23] what makes you different from honey
[1:15:24] everyone else I believe
[1:15:28] Believers believe
[1:15:32] but he had a church that was elected
[1:15:36] so he has tonight
[1:15:39] and that's why he left off from the last
[1:15:41] evening the elected church and then he
[1:15:44] appeared to his elected church only
[1:15:47] the rest of them did not recognize him
[1:15:51] and if he was here today he would just
[1:15:54] do the same thing that he did then
[1:15:59] appeared to the elected believer
[1:16:02] he never appears to the unbeliever
[1:16:06] I want to say that he changes not and
[1:16:10] this same God set a pattern years ago
[1:16:13] and he reveals himself to the elect he
[1:16:17] said my sheep shall hear my voice and a
[1:16:20] stranger they shall not follow
[1:16:27] there is actually no other historical
[1:16:30] event that is celebrated more than the
[1:16:34] resurrection
[1:16:35] 52 times a year
[1:16:38] we here at evening Light Fellowship do
[1:16:42] not come here and talk about a
[1:16:43] historical God but we come here and we
[1:16:47] celebrate a resurrected Christ and we
[1:16:50] recognize that he came out of history
[1:16:53] and he and he brought forth a prophet
[1:16:57] from Malachi 4. behold I send you Elijah
[1:17:02] how many of you can say I've seen the
[1:17:04] Elijah I've heard I know in my heart
[1:17:08] that God once again fulfilling his word
[1:17:11] and you what does that make you when God
[1:17:15] opens your eyes what does that make you
[1:17:18] when you see what God is doing
[1:17:21] bringing his prophecy to pass in this
[1:17:24] hour that makes you part of that elect
[1:17:28] group
[1:17:29] Hallelujah not stuffed shirts not
[1:17:32] somebody that goes to boasting because I
[1:17:35] tell you when God opens your eyes and
[1:17:38] Grace shows you these things you say oh
[1:17:41] God who am I that you would allow my
[1:17:45] eyes to see what kind of a person am I
[1:17:48] I'll tell you let me just bring you
[1:17:50] forward right now you're a God person
[1:17:53] you're a God seed you're a god-elected
[1:17:57] God predestinated elect group
[1:17:59] let me tell you because you got the god
[1:18:02] seed in you you couldn't miss it
[1:18:09] possible
[1:18:14] Muhammad Buddha
[1:18:17] Hare Krishna
[1:18:19] great religious leaders of of the world
[1:18:23] became Godlike
[1:18:25] because of their teachings
[1:18:28] they were men that because of some kind
[1:18:30] of elevated enlighteness or philosophy
[1:18:34] they became a god-like status
[1:18:38] but ours was God
[1:18:40] who became man
[1:18:42] Hallelujah
[1:18:45] he was God he came from God and he went
[1:18:48] back to God
[1:18:51] those others
[1:18:53] their bodies are still with us today
[1:18:59] they're in their tombs
[1:19:02] not ours
[1:19:06] amen
[1:19:10] now we are we know that this time of
[1:19:13] year now I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
[1:19:14] elaborate on this because I've done it
[1:19:16] in years past
[1:19:18] we know that at this time of year as
[1:19:21] well as Christmas
[1:19:23] that the date is has no Biblical
[1:19:27] reference
[1:19:28] or significance
[1:19:30] for us to celebrate what is called
[1:19:33] Easter in fact Easter the name Easter is
[1:19:35] not found in the Bible
[1:19:39] so this holiday or holy day that we
[1:19:43] celebrate as Easter and as Christmas
[1:19:48] is actually not found in the Bible
[1:19:51] and so therefore
[1:19:53] we realize that the things that the
[1:19:57] world celebrates today
[1:20:00] as Easter and they've replaced god with
[1:20:03] the Easter Bunny with Easter eggs
[1:20:08] and all of those things I'm not going to
[1:20:10] go into that because I we are so far
[1:20:13] beyond that
[1:20:15] can you say Amen to that okay
[1:20:21] isn't it ironic that both Christmas and
[1:20:24] Easter the most prominent
[1:20:28] um holy days of the Christian church
[1:20:32] the neither of them are found in the
[1:20:35] Bible
[1:20:37] I thank God that we had a prophet that
[1:20:40] came
[1:20:41] and he revealed to us the word of the
[1:20:44] hour bringing
[1:20:46] the Christ who is historical
[1:20:49] out of History
[1:20:51] and told us that he's Hebrews 13 and 8.
[1:20:55] for Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:20:58] today and forever
[1:21:02] in Revelations 19 verse 10 the Bible
[1:21:05] says
[1:21:07] and I fell at his feet to worship him
[1:21:10] and said unto him see thou do it not
[1:21:13] I am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:21:15] Brethren to have the testimony of Jesus
[1:21:18] worship God for the testimony of Jesus
[1:21:22] is the spirit of Prophecy
[1:21:25] now remember that the Bible says that
[1:21:28] men of old were moved on by the Holy
[1:21:30] Spirit and as they speak they speak
[1:21:32] under the utterance of the holy spirit
[1:21:34] is that correct and scribes wrote that
[1:21:38] down it became the word of God these men
[1:21:40] did not understand what they were
[1:21:42] prophesying they didn't understand the
[1:21:45] things that they were writing down
[1:21:46] Behold a virgin shall conceive they had
[1:21:49] no idea that it never happened before
[1:21:52] but let me tell you God doesn't ask you
[1:21:55] to try to understand it he just asked
[1:21:58] you believe it
[1:22:00] somebody say I believe
[1:22:03] yes of course why you're a believer
[1:22:07] he doesn't reveal
[1:22:10] himself to unbelievers
[1:22:15] so that is your testimony
[1:22:18] having the spirit of Prophecy
[1:22:25] the spirit will always Quicken the word
[1:22:29] for its season
[1:22:31] God and Quicken Noah in his season
[1:22:36] he quickened Moses with a word in his
[1:22:41] season
[1:22:43] God quickened the disciples in their day
[1:22:46] with
[1:22:48] it in a season
[1:22:50] and God has quickened us
[1:22:57] he has quickened us
[1:22:59] with a word in its season
[1:23:05] you see we do not have to make a
[1:23:07] pilgrimage back to the tomb
[1:23:10] to believe
[1:23:13] we don't have to go back to Egypt and
[1:23:16] look where the Exodus took place and
[1:23:18] pharaoh and Moses and you know the story
[1:23:23] We're Not Looking Back to find
[1:23:25] artificial uh artifacts of events we
[1:23:30] don't need to go find Noah's Ark to
[1:23:33] believe there was an art
[1:23:37] but we're going to go to where the word
[1:23:41] is being quickened for this hour
[1:23:44] we're looking to a word-born bride
[1:23:47] that has come to her position
[1:23:51] let us go to the place
[1:23:53] because the prophet of God said there is
[1:23:56] a god-ordained place of worship that is
[1:23:59] in Christ
[1:24:03] let's go to the place where Angels still
[1:24:05] appear
[1:24:07] place where angels are declaring
[1:24:09] prophecy being fulfilled being quickened
[1:24:13] to somebody and say this day is the
[1:24:16] scripture being fulfilled
[1:24:20] that ordained place is called the holy
[1:24:22] of holies the heart
[1:24:24] of the Bride of Jesus Christ Where
[1:24:27] Angels are still declaring he is risen
[1:24:32] we're not going back to an unsealed tomb
[1:24:35] where Christ had risen
[1:24:37] but we're going back to the place where
[1:24:40] the unsealed Mysteries of the word you
[1:24:43] talk about a seal broken back then
[1:24:46] let me just bring you to seal broken
[1:24:50] again in this day
[1:24:51] Hallelujah he said this seventh angel
[1:24:54] he's got no particular mystery he's got
[1:24:59] no particular thing but he takes what
[1:25:01] the others probed at all down Through
[1:25:04] the Ages puts it together this belongs
[1:25:06] here Luther here Wesley penny cost and
[1:25:10] there he puts the parts that men Godly
[1:25:14] men that probe that and there before our
[1:25:17] wandering eyes the whole picture of the
[1:25:19] Redemption
[1:25:21] the whole mystery of God
[1:25:23] you see Adam when he was first formed
[1:25:27] and men had been made out of the Dust of
[1:25:29] the year and he was put to sleep
[1:25:31] when Eve came she was the mystery of
[1:25:35] Adam revealed
[1:25:36] do you understand this bride is the
[1:25:39] mystery of the second Adam revealed the
[1:25:42] mystery the seal being torn off they
[1:25:45] first had a Christ now it's the bride of
[1:25:48] Christ they had the first coming and now
[1:25:52] we have a second coming
[1:25:55] yet it's Christ
[1:26:05] the resurrection
[1:26:08] is not just in an event or a special
[1:26:11] place
[1:26:14] it's an appearing
[1:26:17] it's a spiritual awakening to every
[1:26:20] believer
[1:26:22] isn't it amazing that we hear in our
[1:26:25] news today about all of this woke
[1:26:28] generation
[1:26:32] and
[1:26:33] I'll tell you
[1:26:36] just a few years ago we would have never
[1:26:39] thought
[1:26:40] that the people's mind would be so woke
[1:26:45] that they would be lulled asleep
[1:26:48] they have no morals
[1:26:51] they have no concept of what is right is
[1:26:54] wrong
[1:27:01] when you catch revelation
[1:27:05] It's actually an appearing to you
[1:27:09] I want you to let that sink in when the
[1:27:13] word of God is quickened to you by the
[1:27:15] Holy Spirit it brings forth another
[1:27:19] Rising
[1:27:21] because as he arose
[1:27:26] she's Rising
[1:27:28] why the body must follow the head
[1:27:33] we can see Christ in the Old Testament
[1:27:35] prophets
[1:27:36] we can see Christ down through history
[1:27:40] Satan is not afraid
[1:27:43] of a historical Christ
[1:27:46] you can talk about Jesus of Nazareth
[1:27:50] you can talk about he was born crucified
[1:27:53] resurrected as long as you put him in a
[1:27:56] past tense
[1:27:58] he doesn't care if you talk about the
[1:28:01] Pentecost of 1906. he doesn't care if
[1:28:04] you talk about what an anointing there
[1:28:06] was in the prophet's Ministry as long as
[1:28:10] you got looking back
[1:28:12] in the rear view mirror brother bran
[1:28:15] said to look in the rear view mirror uh
[1:28:17] he said you're going to crack up listen
[1:28:19] We're Not Looking Back we're looking
[1:28:22] forward there's future events made clear
[1:28:25] by prophecy The Same Spirit that uttered
[1:28:30] the prophetic word it's the same Spirit
[1:28:32] that's got to be on every believer to
[1:28:36] make you understand this day this
[1:28:39] scripture is being fulfilled
[1:28:44] this end time message
[1:28:47] has jettisoned so far forward from 2 000
[1:28:51] years ago to a god of History
[1:28:55] excuse me to a god of present tense and
[1:28:58] out of History
[1:29:00] the bride has been awakened by the
[1:29:02] seventh Angel's voice
[1:29:05] just as God did everything in the Book
[1:29:07] of Genesis
[1:29:09] and when God began to create the heavens
[1:29:12] and the Earth and God said let there be
[1:29:14] light and there was light
[1:29:16] and God said and it happened and God
[1:29:18] said why because everything that it was
[1:29:21] ever created was created by the
[1:29:24] quickened voice of God
[1:29:26] there why would it be any different than
[1:29:30] today for you
[1:29:32] to be here in this hour to hear a voice
[1:29:36] and let me tell you let's go beyond the
[1:29:39] voice of William Branham he said God is
[1:29:43] using my vocal cords but he said the
[1:29:46] voice that anointing it's no longer I
[1:29:50] it's not William Branham that's speaking
[1:29:52] to you this is almighty God once all man
[1:29:57] and another saw God and they were both
[1:29:59] right but I tell you which one are you
[1:30:01] looking at this morning I say it was God
[1:30:04] [Music]
[1:30:06] that's nothing but the truth
[1:30:09] you start agreeing to that word you
[1:30:12] start lighting yourself up to it
[1:30:14] and that third poll the revealing of the
[1:30:17] word will give to you precious promises
[1:30:21] it may be something you haven't need in
[1:30:23] your family and you say that's nothing
[1:30:25] but the truth I give you your family you
[1:30:29] might have something that's going wrong
[1:30:31] in your life I give this to you in the
[1:30:33] name of Jesus Christ
[1:30:36] [Music]
[1:30:41] the seventh seal open unto us a mystery
[1:30:45] Secret
[1:30:47] let me declare to you
[1:30:50] there's all kinds of movies and
[1:30:52] different things
[1:30:54] The Da Vinci Code
[1:30:57] um you know uh the Raiders of the Lost
[1:31:00] Ark
[1:31:02] on and so forth all of these that are
[1:31:05] trying to find some kind of secret
[1:31:07] passage
[1:31:08] some kind of special formula to find
[1:31:12] where the secret passage is into the
[1:31:16] place that you want to find the greatest
[1:31:18] treasure
[1:31:21] the seventh seal unlocks to the bride
[1:31:24] the entire Bible
[1:31:27] it is the secret passage
[1:31:33] listen to God's only provided place of
[1:31:36] worship
[1:31:40] now sometime I'd like to come to
[1:31:42] Shreveport where we just have about two
[1:31:45] or three weeks just to take 30 minutes a
[1:31:47] night just on teaching seeing just stay
[1:31:51] right in the word these Secret
[1:31:54] passages
[1:31:58] you catch that
[1:32:00] I'd like to just stay here and teach on
[1:32:04] these secret passage
[1:32:05] all of a sudden you touch this door and
[1:32:13] see where we could find out just how to
[1:32:15] get in
[1:32:17] and you just watch you follow God's
[1:32:19] direction there's only one key to each
[1:32:21] door that's right no other key no matter
[1:32:24] how much it looks like God has no
[1:32:26] Skeleton Key
[1:32:28] just got one key and now you've got to
[1:32:31] have that key or the door won't unlock
[1:32:34] no matter how sincere you are you just
[1:32:37] can't unlock that door brother Bradham
[1:32:40] said what key is it that unlocks the
[1:32:42] door and that door is Christ he said the
[1:32:45] only way that you can understand it's
[1:32:48] not father son Holy Ghost when the key
[1:32:51] is turned and the door is unlocked and
[1:32:54] Christ that door you find out it's not
[1:32:56] father-son Holy Ghost it's Lord Jesus
[1:32:59] Christ enter in
[1:33:04] Matthew Mark Luke John are the four
[1:33:07] guardians of a secret passage
[1:33:11] and it takes faith to open that
[1:33:18] without that listen to me
[1:33:22] I want to call this key
[1:33:27] this appearing
[1:33:29] this quickening
[1:33:31] this Awakening
[1:33:34] I want to call it the resurrection
[1:33:36] Factor
[1:33:39] it is the element that must be
[1:33:42] identified in each believer before
[1:33:46] transformation
[1:33:48] for Enoch had this within himself before
[1:33:53] he was translated
[1:33:56] therefore telling us that we must have
[1:33:59] the same quickening power
[1:34:03] you're not getting the quickening power
[1:34:05] because you were raised in a message
[1:34:07] family
[1:34:08] you're not getting it because you're
[1:34:10] raised in a message Church
[1:34:13] you're only going to get it when you are
[1:34:15] birthed by the quickening
[1:34:17] of the revealed word of the hour
[1:34:21] Hallelujah
[1:34:25] that and that alone will transform you
[1:34:27] not to conform be not conformed
[1:34:31] I think over the years we have conformed
[1:34:34] a lot of church members we have
[1:34:37] conformed people to do this and to wear
[1:34:40] a dress and keep your hair long don't go
[1:34:43] to movies we've conformed them that
[1:34:45] means to mold Under Pressure but be not
[1:34:48] conform but be ye transformed by the
[1:34:51] renewing of your mind
[1:34:54] Hallelujah that's what the power of
[1:34:57] transformation is it's that third pull
[1:34:59] it's in you it's that secret passage
[1:35:03] that the world knows nothing about we
[1:35:06] speak another language that the world
[1:35:08] cannot understand to them it is tongues
[1:35:12] but to you it has an interpretation what
[1:35:15] is it God revealing himself
[1:35:23] Colossians 1 verse 26 and 29.
[1:35:28] even the mystery which have been hid
[1:35:30] from ages and from Generations
[1:35:34] but now has made manifest to his Saints
[1:35:37] to whom God would make known god listen
[1:35:41] to whom God would make known
[1:35:44] no man gave you this
[1:35:52] Paul says I certify to you Brethren that
[1:35:54] this which I preach unto you was not
[1:35:56] given to be my man
[1:35:58] neither did I learn it by man but it was
[1:36:00] by the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:36:04] to whom God would make known what is the
[1:36:07] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:36:10] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[1:36:13] you
[1:36:14] the hope of glory
[1:36:16] whom we preach warning every man
[1:36:18] teaching every man in all wisdom that we
[1:36:21] may present every man perfect in Christ
[1:36:24] Jesus
[1:36:25] wherefore I also labor striving
[1:36:27] according to his working
[1:36:30] which worketh in me
[1:36:33] mightily
[1:36:36] his word is working mightily in me
[1:36:42] why it's Christ in you
[1:36:47] the seed Gene
[1:36:52] do you remember years ago brother
[1:36:53] Stephen love oh you got me a book called
[1:36:55] The God Gene remember that you gave it
[1:36:58] to me
[1:37:02] they said there is hardwired
[1:37:05] these are scientists
[1:37:08] they said there is hardwired into
[1:37:12] your genetic chromosome
[1:37:18] that you are hardwired to hear
[1:37:22] his voice
[1:37:25] it is called they call it the god Gene
[1:37:28] the prophet of God years ago said within
[1:37:32] each elect's seed is a sea Gene of God
[1:37:36] if you're a part of God you always were
[1:37:40] a part of God if you came from God
[1:37:43] you're going back to God
[1:37:46] I want you to understand that these
[1:37:48] which are called the elect of God
[1:37:56] have a supernatural quality
[1:38:02] it's hardwired
[1:38:07] you couldn't help it when you heard the
[1:38:10] voice of Malachi 4.
[1:38:13] I've heard that voice before
[1:38:19] yes you did
[1:38:23] this is not deja vu
[1:38:27] but I will say to you that if you heard
[1:38:30] the voice of God in this day
[1:38:33] you also heard it back in Eternal ages
[1:38:47] without this Factor
[1:38:50] you will never be changed in a moment
[1:38:54] you will never be raptured you will
[1:38:56] never be caught up together with them in
[1:38:58] the air
[1:39:00] but with it you can't miss it
[1:39:07] you can't
[1:39:11] I will substantiate that just hang on
[1:39:14] Romans 8 verses 10 through 11. if Christ
[1:39:17] be in you
[1:39:19] the body is dead because of sin but the
[1:39:22] spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:39:23] but if the spirit of him
[1:39:26] they raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:39:30] in you
[1:39:32] he that raised a
[1:39:34] Christ from the dead also shall also
[1:39:38] Quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit
[1:39:42] that dwelleth in you
[1:39:49] if the Same Spirit
[1:39:51] do you see that a prophet of God said
[1:39:54] that this promise of God is to the elect
[1:39:58] for the promise is unto you and to your
[1:40:01] children and your children's children
[1:40:05] what promise is that I send unto you the
[1:40:08] promise of the father
[1:40:10] I must go away
[1:40:12] but he said the promise cannot come
[1:40:15] until I go away
[1:40:17] and if I go away
[1:40:19] he the Holy Spirit of promise
[1:40:23] we'll come back to you
[1:40:26] what is it it's God
[1:40:29] evolving himself into another form it is
[1:40:33] God now in Martha God changing his mask
[1:40:37] going from a one-member party to a
[1:40:41] multi-membered body called the mystical
[1:40:44] body of Jesus Christ
[1:40:54] Quicken your mortal body
[1:41:02] all of them
[1:41:05] that were quickened by his voice
[1:41:09] were also quickened in the resurrection
[1:41:14] so the resurrection factor is not just a
[1:41:17] special event that takes place in
[1:41:18] history over 2 000 years ago
[1:41:22] for Christ was already the resurrection
[1:41:25] before the event took place
[1:41:32] he was the resurrection just waiting to
[1:41:36] manifest itself in due seasons
[1:41:40] Lazarus understand was already a part of
[1:41:43] the Resurrection by believing The Words
[1:41:45] of Christ
[1:41:47] for Christ is a resurrection factor for
[1:41:50] every believer
[1:41:53] he that half the son hath life and he
[1:41:57] that hath not the son hath not life
[1:42:04] Jesus said
[1:42:06] speaking to Mary and Martha we know our
[1:42:09] brother will rise again
[1:42:12] Jesus said he's sleepeth
[1:42:17] he said he shall rise again I know at
[1:42:20] the time of the resurrection and Jesus
[1:42:22] said now the some of the most astounding
[1:42:25] words
[1:42:27] I am
[1:42:29] the resurrection
[1:42:35] you talk about lock up a human hard
[1:42:37] drive
[1:42:39] oh
[1:42:40] I am the resurrection and he that
[1:42:44] believeth in me shall not die but shall
[1:42:48] have everlasting life
[1:42:50] for he cannot die I want you to
[1:42:53] understand when God hath quickened the
[1:42:55] elect seed inside of you you have been
[1:42:58] quick and you cannot die
[1:43:01] the devil can do all things oh yes you
[1:43:03] can die in this Mortal body but when it
[1:43:06] does that seed goes on it lives again it
[1:43:10] never dies it's Eternal you are as
[1:43:13] Eternal as God is eternal
[1:43:18] you can no more die
[1:43:20] than God could die
[1:43:25] here's something that's astounding
[1:43:27] brother Branham said that when Jesus
[1:43:30] Christ went to Calvary
[1:43:32] he went as a man
[1:43:36] the man Christ Jesus
[1:43:39] and said there in the Garden of
[1:43:42] Gethsemane
[1:43:44] he prayed o God let this cup pass from
[1:43:47] me
[1:43:49] but nevertheless
[1:43:51] not my will but thine be done
[1:43:55] and brother Branham now here's a mystery
[1:43:59] we had never heard this before he said
[1:44:01] the spirit of God
[1:44:03] and how left the body
[1:44:06] of Jesus Christ
[1:44:10] and there they whipped him up the hill
[1:44:12] as a man
[1:44:17] there
[1:44:18] they crucified
[1:44:20] a man
[1:44:25] do you understand
[1:44:27] he suffered in bled and died as a man
[1:44:30] why because Adam
[1:44:33] was a man who transgressed and if
[1:44:37] because of man transgressed you see the
[1:44:40] first Adam he transgressed so now God
[1:44:44] okay has to come himself
[1:44:49] he's Jehovah Jireh
[1:44:51] God will provide himself
[1:44:57] as the sacrifice
[1:45:09] if I said okay there's a penalty and
[1:45:12] somebody's going to die
[1:45:15] and I said well I'm going to send Amos
[1:45:18] Amos you can die
[1:45:21] okay be that faithful obedient son
[1:45:27] would that seem to be fair
[1:45:30] but how about if God said
[1:45:33] a man must die
[1:45:35] it must be a kinsman redeemer
[1:45:40] he shall be born of my bone and flesh
[1:45:44] and he took the man Christ Jesus and he
[1:45:48] crucified him why because it was a man
[1:45:51] that sinned it had to be a man to be a
[1:45:54] kinsman redeemer but let's take it
[1:45:57] farther than just a man because he was
[1:45:59] the son of man but the body himself
[1:46:03] they're crucified was the man Christ
[1:46:06] Jesus
[1:46:13] even the Centurion
[1:46:19] wow and he saw him bow his head and died
[1:46:26] truly this was
[1:46:29] the son of God
[1:46:36] the tomb where Jesus was buried
[1:46:40] was empty that first resurrection
[1:46:42] morning
[1:46:44] it was a rising of the Sun
[1:46:47] the wave Sheaf
[1:46:49] the head of the body
[1:46:52] it was the only begotten son of Son of
[1:46:56] God
[1:46:57] brother Brown said in him
[1:46:59] that is in him Jesus Christ
[1:47:05] dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:47:10] do you understand in him he was
[1:47:14] the seed
[1:47:16] he was the only begotten son of
[1:47:22] brother Branham said there at Calvary
[1:47:26] he said the seal which was Christ was
[1:47:30] broken
[1:47:31] and he said inside of his heart where
[1:47:35] that seed lies he said he emptied out
[1:47:39] that seed upon the Earth and he says and
[1:47:42] now
[1:47:43] okay Satan thought I got him
[1:47:47] I have crucified he who was the Messiah
[1:47:51] I have crucified him
[1:47:54] he's dead and gone
[1:47:57] but God pulled a trick on him
[1:48:02] he said except the corn of wheat
[1:48:06] dies it invites alone
[1:48:10] if he could have caught that Revelation
[1:48:12] he would have never let him be crucified
[1:48:18] but there he Spore he the Bible says and
[1:48:21] he spilled out his soul unto death
[1:48:24] and there planted down on this Earth was
[1:48:29] elect seed
[1:48:31] and it is to come in the decreed season
[1:48:33] you didn't come in the time of the first
[1:48:36] church age that was another season same
[1:48:39] seed another season
[1:48:42] but it went down through Ephesus and
[1:48:44] Smyrna and titira and came down into the
[1:48:48] most corrupt of all the ages and laudia
[1:48:51] Sia where man is miserable blind
[1:48:55] wretched and naked and doesn't know it
[1:48:57] boy if that doesn't talk about this age
[1:49:00] that we're in now
[1:49:05] and inside of the loudiestian church age
[1:49:09] was poured out seed
[1:49:12] and then the voice of this seventh angel
[1:49:15] when he should begin to sound not when
[1:49:18] he starts his ministry but when he
[1:49:20] begins to unveil the revealed word the
[1:49:24] third pull
[1:49:27] that's what I've got to be reverent to
[1:49:31] now watch Christ is the mystery of God
[1:49:33] revealed
[1:49:38] as the head was taken from the grave so
[1:49:40] must the body follow him back to Eden
[1:49:44] where the head of the family the man the
[1:49:48] bridegroom the bride being the body of
[1:49:50] the bridegroom must follow the bride
[1:49:53] because that's the head and the head is
[1:49:57] revealed and come back with the eternal
[1:49:59] life and the body must follow that
[1:50:02] because it is husband and wife
[1:50:05] again
[1:50:07] don't fail this
[1:50:09] the body therefore cannot recognize any
[1:50:12] other headship but the word
[1:50:15] because the head is connected with the
[1:50:17] body
[1:50:18] and the head is the word and it's the
[1:50:21] same word one hit you
[1:50:23] there's one headship that's Christ and
[1:50:26] the body only recognizes the thing the
[1:50:29] word the body must follow the head as
[1:50:32] the wife follows her husband
[1:50:36] how many believe that
[1:50:41] in the sermon I know brother Branham
[1:50:43] picks this up oh blessed be the name of
[1:50:46] the Lord
[1:50:47] I'm so glad that I'm a part of Easter
[1:50:51] I'm a part of that Resurrection
[1:50:55] and we are a part of it this morning
[1:50:57] because in US dwells that Resurrection
[1:51:00] Life
[1:51:03] that as a partaker brought Easter
[1:51:08] I know my redeemer living
[1:51:13] you see it's the spirit of God moving in
[1:51:16] The Believer
[1:51:18] or it'll never bring forth
[1:51:21] that see Gene to fruition until it is
[1:51:25] quickened by the words of life
[1:51:28] therefore the spirit of God moves upon
[1:51:31] you
[1:51:32] it is overshadowing you just as Mary was
[1:51:36] overshadowed because she said how can
[1:51:39] these things be
[1:51:41] how this word I'm supposed to bring
[1:51:43] forth a Christ child how can it be
[1:51:46] knowing that I've known no man said in
[1:51:49] not many days hence the Holy Spirit
[1:51:51] shall over Shadow you
[1:51:54] and you shall conceive is that right
[1:51:57] that conception in Mary was of the Holy
[1:52:02] Spirit do you understand that the
[1:52:04] conception inside of you is no different
[1:52:07] than it was with Mary that conception
[1:52:11] [Music]
[1:52:13] is the Holy Spirit overshadowing you
[1:52:16] conceiving life without sensation
[1:52:20] it's not some emotion
[1:52:23] it's not something worked up
[1:52:27] in fact the only time that a woman knows
[1:52:30] the seed inside of her because she can
[1:52:33] be with a man many times receiving seed
[1:52:36] receiving seed receiving seed but if
[1:52:39] that seed does not germatized within
[1:52:42] every 28 to 30 days
[1:52:44] that seed is cast out of the body are
[1:52:47] you understanding we're talking about a
[1:52:49] cycle of a woman
[1:52:51] but
[1:52:53] when she is together
[1:52:55] with a man who has life
[1:52:58] and he imparts unto her a a germ of life
[1:53:03] and it takes place inside of her there's
[1:53:07] a pregnation how does she know she's
[1:53:10] pregnant
[1:53:15] there's a body change
[1:53:20] at the time of the impartation
[1:53:24] it might have been just like every other
[1:53:26] time
[1:53:29] a time of Union
[1:53:31] but until
[1:53:34] the faith is conceived to take the seed
[1:53:39] and to impart to it life
[1:53:43] but when faith
[1:53:47] comes to that field
[1:53:49] you are just a field
[1:53:52] and any farmer knows you can till the
[1:53:56] soil
[1:53:57] you can you can do it you can put
[1:53:59] fertilizer on it and everything but you
[1:54:01] must plant seed
[1:54:04] because every seed
[1:54:07] will bring forth of its own kind
[1:54:11] you did not become seed by the rebirth
[1:54:16] that's a wrong teaching
[1:54:20] no you
[1:54:22] were reborn because you were seated
[1:54:27] he said in non-seat follow this
[1:54:30] he said in non-seed there is nothing to
[1:54:33] Quicken
[1:54:39] what does that make you
[1:54:44] oh
[1:54:47] it must be the spirit of God moving on
[1:54:49] you
[1:54:50] it's not the wisdom of man
[1:54:53] it's not with the enticing words of
[1:54:56] man's Wisdom
[1:54:58] Apostle Paul said look I'm not going to
[1:55:00] come to you with enticing words of man's
[1:55:02] Wisdom but Empower and demonstration
[1:55:06] knowledge and intellectual teaching only
[1:55:09] causes a confirmation but the Holy
[1:55:12] Spirit causes a transformation
[1:55:17] I want you to understand Lazarus had the
[1:55:19] resurrection Factor already in him
[1:55:21] before he died
[1:55:27] John 6 verses 52 and 54 now the Jews
[1:55:31] therefore strove among themselves saying
[1:55:33] how can this man give us his flesh to
[1:55:35] eat
[1:55:38] then said Jesus on them fairly verily
[1:55:40] Ascend to you
[1:55:42] except you eat of the Flesh of the son
[1:55:44] of man and drink his blood
[1:55:46] you have no life in you
[1:55:49] who so eateth my flesh
[1:55:52] and drinketh my blood
[1:55:54] hath
[1:55:56] eternal life
[1:55:57] and I will raise him up
[1:56:01] in the last days you see
[1:56:04] he is rising causes
[1:56:07] her to write
[1:56:09] and I will raise him up
[1:56:12] I want you to understand
[1:56:14] this message has caused the rising
[1:56:19] how many of you can say Amen he caused
[1:56:23] me to rise up out of old cold
[1:56:26] carnal denomination out of carnal
[1:56:29] thinking out of all of that and because
[1:56:32] the carnal mind is enmity with God and
[1:56:35] neither can it know the things of God
[1:56:37] but when you began to catch the
[1:56:40] revelation of this you know what God was
[1:56:42] doing come up hither
[1:56:44] he was actually causing you to rise
[1:56:47] every Revelation that comes to you
[1:56:50] causes you to rise closer into the image
[1:56:54] of the sun Hallelujah do you realize
[1:56:58] this the sun crosses the sky and
[1:57:01] everything that is he doing he is
[1:57:03] ordained to life from that solar energy
[1:57:07] every plant The Rock feels the warmth of
[1:57:11] the Sun but it does nothing to the rod
[1:57:13] but make it warm and fuzzy
[1:57:17] but when that elects seed catches
[1:57:20] the solar energy
[1:57:22] and it comes over if it is either if it
[1:57:25] is ordained to eternal life it doesn't
[1:57:27] matter how many of you have been
[1:57:30] somewhere and they pour all of this
[1:57:32] concrete and and stuff and then there's
[1:57:34] just there's just a little line they're
[1:57:37] just a small little line and up comes
[1:57:38] the blade of grass
[1:57:41] how in the world it comes through all
[1:57:42] that concrete
[1:57:44] how did it survive how many of you have
[1:57:46] climbed the great mountains and you've
[1:57:48] gone up in rocks and Ledges and stone
[1:57:52] everywhere and all of a sudden there's a
[1:57:54] plant right on the edge I don't know who
[1:57:56] planted that
[1:57:58] how did it get up there there ain't no
[1:58:00] water they know huh how did it get there
[1:58:03] let me tell you everything ordained do
[1:58:05] eternal life when that sun when the son
[1:58:09] of man are you catching me this is the
[1:58:12] day of the revealing of the son of man
[1:58:14] when they came across your path
[1:58:18] it quickened unto you life and you
[1:58:21] didn't know it
[1:58:33] let me share something that came to me
[1:58:35] this morning
[1:58:40] in the Book of Revelation
[1:58:42] There is five takings of the book
[1:58:49] you like that
[1:58:51] let me show you
[1:58:53] Revelations 5 verses 5 through 7.
[1:59:01] one of the elders saith unto me weep not
[1:59:03] be
[1:59:04] Behold The Lion somebody say lion
[1:59:09] of the tribe of Judah the root of David
[1:59:12] have prevailed to open the book and to
[1:59:15] loose the Seven Seals thereof
[1:59:19] and then be held low in the midst of the
[1:59:20] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[1:59:23] midst of the Elder stood a lamb
[1:59:30] as it had been slain having seven horns
[1:59:32] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:59:34] of God sent forth into all there and he
[1:59:36] came and took the book you see that's
[1:59:38] the first time
[1:59:39] he took the book out of the right hand
[1:59:41] of him that sat on the throne
[1:59:44] the first time the book was taken what
[1:59:47] was it lion
[1:59:51] remember John in the Book of Revelation
[1:59:57] do you do you remember
[2:00:00] the first time it was
[2:00:03] that when the book of redemption was
[2:00:05] lost there was no man found worthy on
[2:00:07] Earth nor in heaven or on Earth no one
[2:00:09] was worthy to take the book in order to
[2:00:12] look there on
[2:00:15] and I John wept
[2:00:17] seeing no one was worthy but there was a
[2:00:20] voice behind me weep not John for the
[2:00:23] lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[2:00:25] prevailed then I turned to look at the
[2:00:28] lion and what did he see
[2:00:32] a lamb
[2:00:35] so watch this first one
[2:00:38] the lion
[2:00:41] of the tribe of Judah
[2:00:45] the root of David
[2:00:48] hath prevailed to open the book and he
[2:00:51] came and took the book out of the right
[2:00:52] hand
[2:00:53] of him that sat on the throne
[2:00:56] that's the first taking of the book
[2:00:58] second taking in the book

[2:01:18] Mighty angel
[2:01:20] come down from heaven brother Ram said
[2:01:22] watch these angels one's a Heavenly
[2:01:25] Angel the others an Earthly Angel are we

[2:01:31] cloud

[2:01:35] were the son his feet as pillars of Fire
[2:01:39] and he had in his hand a little book
[2:01:42] opened
[2:01:44] and he set his Foot Right Foot upon the
[2:01:46] sea his left foot on the earth cried
[2:01:49] with a loud voice that's when a lion
[2:01:51] roared and when he cried seven Saunders
[2:01:55] uttered their voices do you see the
[2:01:59] mighty Angels coming down that a mighty
[2:02:02] Angels none other than the lamb who was
[2:02:05] Worthy
[2:02:07] took the book
[2:02:10] the third time
[2:02:12] Revelations 10 7-8
[2:02:20] and the seventh angel takes a little
[2:02:22] book that had been sealed with the Seven
[2:02:24] Seals the seventh angel when he begins
[2:02:27] to sell and he finishes the mystery of
[2:02:29] God watch this Revelations 10 7-8 but in
[2:02:33] the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:02:34] angel when he shall begin to sound
[2:02:37] prophet of God says that word sound
[2:02:39] means to sell Pizzo
[2:02:41] the Greek word is to blast forth a
[2:02:44] trumpet
[2:02:45] it's a jubilee trumpet
[2:02:48] it's a trump to signify the Gathering
[2:02:51] Two Trumpets in The Book of Leviticus
[2:02:53] two silver trumpets one is for the
[2:02:56] Gathering the second trumpet
[2:02:58] is for the moving of the camp
[2:03:04] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[2:03:06] spoken to me again go and take the
[2:03:08] little book
[2:03:10] which is open in the hand of the angel
[2:03:13] which standeth upon the sea so the
[2:03:16] Earthly angel

[2:03:35] was closed Revelations 5 it's closed
[2:03:38] Revelations 10 it's open
[2:03:42] let me say this it was not the propheto
[2:03:45] that opened the Seven Seals
[2:03:47] it was Christ
[2:03:51] because he is those seals
[2:03:59] because
[2:04:01] this book is called
[2:04:03] the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:04:06] it is the book of
[2:04:08] Redemption
[2:04:12] now the fourth time the book is taken
[2:04:16] Revelations 10 and 9. are we together
[2:04:18] you fall are you like this
[2:04:21] Revelations 10 9-11 and I went under the

[2:04:26] elect bright
[2:04:28] give me the little book wow
[2:04:33] talk about an entitlement give me the
[2:04:36] book

[2:04:43] that there's something inside of him
[2:04:45] said take the book
[2:04:48] so now he says give me the book he says
[2:04:52] it with authority why he knows his
[2:04:54] position
[2:04:56] every bride member knows their position
[2:04:59] under the seventh seal it is that secret
[2:05:02] passage
[2:05:04] it is a secret passage that opens the
[2:05:08] door which is Christ
[2:05:12] I said unto him give me the little bug
[2:05:14] he said unto me take it and eat it shall
[2:05:19] make thy belly bitter but Thou shalt be
[2:05:21] in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took
[2:05:23] the look the little book out of the
[2:05:26] Angel's hand and I ate it up spiritual
[2:05:28] food
[2:05:29] in due season
[2:05:34] now
[2:05:36] they all must prophesy
[2:05:39] the ministry
[2:05:41] continues
[2:05:43] let me tell you the ministry of Malachi
[2:05:45] 4 did not stop
[2:05:47] when he went off the scene
[2:05:52] for thou must prophesy
[2:05:55] again before many people's Nations
[2:05:57] tongues and kings
[2:06:01] yet there's another taking of the book
[2:06:06] revelation 22.
[2:06:12] I didn't have a chance to write this

[2:06:33] prophecy of this book
[2:06:37] follow the book and where it goes
[2:06:41] and I John saw these things and heard
[2:06:43] them
[2:06:44] and when I heard and seen I fell down to
[2:06:47] worship before the the feet of the Angel
[2:06:49] which showed me these sayings and he
[2:06:52] said unto me see thou do it not I am thy
[2:06:54] fellow servant and of thy Brethren the
[2:06:56] prophets and of them which keep the
[2:06:58] sayings of this book worship God
[2:07:02] follow the book
[2:07:04] and he saith unto me seal not the
[2:07:07] sayings of the prophecy of this book

[2:07:19] seal not
[2:07:21] it's been sealed up Daniel seal it up
[2:07:24] Isaiah write it not

[2:07:30] the prophecy of this this book why the
[2:07:34] book's got to come forth
[2:07:43] do you understand the book is not a
[2:07:46] physical book
[2:07:50] person
[2:07:52] it's a people
[2:07:56] seal not the prophecy of this book
[2:08:02] for the time
[2:08:04] is at hand so now it's hidden in symbols
[2:08:10] this is the third pull
[2:08:12] this is what I've got to be reverent to
[2:08:15] it's not the first and second poll and
[2:08:18] the discernments and the sign in the
[2:08:20] hand and all of the signs and wonders no
[2:08:24] this is now the revealing of the word
[2:08:27] he said you can't teach it to him
[2:08:30] you try to teach
[2:08:31] Pentecostal babies
[2:08:33] Supernatural things all you do is make
[2:08:35] carnal impersonation
[2:08:38] no this is not an impersonation
[2:08:42] this is the person
[2:08:45] in the nation
[2:08:47] are you following it is now the person
[2:08:50] of Jesus Christ
[2:08:52] in you the mystery of God the seventh
[2:08:57] seal brings him back to Earth the
[2:08:59] seventh seal unlocks the mystery of
[2:09:02] Christ The Mystery of God
[2:09:05] Hallelujah you understand it five times
[2:09:08] the book transfers and it's picked up
[2:09:11] also in First Corinthians 15 verses 50
[2:09:16] through 54. now I say unto you Brethren
[2:09:19] and Flesh and Blood did not inherit the
[2:09:22] king that cannot inherit the kingdom of
[2:09:24] God
[2:09:24] neither does corruption inherit
[2:09:27] encryption
[2:09:28] behold I show you a mystery
[2:09:32] we shall not all sleep and we shall all
[2:09:34] be changed
[2:09:36] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[2:09:40] at the last Trump
[2:09:42] for the Trump shall be shall sound in
[2:09:45] the dead shall be raised Incorruptible
[2:09:47] and shall be changed
[2:09:50] the Bible says in the twinkling of an
[2:09:53] eye scientists have said that's one
[2:09:56] tenth of a second
[2:09:59] in a twinkling just a little
[2:10:01] one-tenth
[2:10:03] because the Bible says in the Old
[2:10:06] Testament one tenth is Holy
[2:10:08] unto the Lord tithing
[2:10:10] one-tenth
[2:10:12] we could take you through the scriptures
[2:10:14] one tenth is Holy unto the Lord
[2:10:20] and so in a moment one tenth
[2:10:23] you see this Holiness unto the Lord
[2:10:28] shall not sleep and we shall be changed
[2:10:31] for this corrupt Upon Us must put on
[2:10:34] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[2:10:36] immortality so when this corruptable
[2:10:39] shall have put on incorruption then this
[2:10:42] Mortal shall have put on immortality
[2:10:44] then shall be brought to pass us saying
[2:10:46] that it is written death is swallowed up
[2:10:49] in Victory
[2:10:53] when he comes to take the bride off the
[2:10:55] Earth
[2:10:57] he's actually taking the book
[2:11:03] he's Redeeming the names that were
[2:11:06] written in the Lamb's Book of Life the
[2:11:09] book of redemption and the rapture
[2:11:12] he takes the book
[2:11:15] why because everybody whose names were
[2:11:18] written predestinated the elect of God
[2:11:21] that were written on the Lamb's Book of
[2:11:24] Life he's not leaving one here he's
[2:11:26] taking the book and when he redeems the
[2:11:29] book
[2:11:30] he takes the book what is it it's a
[2:11:34] bride I'm digging a bride it's mine
[2:11:39] it's those I have redeemed
[2:11:46] called The Secret
[2:11:48] catching away of the Bride
[2:11:52] questions answers after the brightest
[2:11:55] Rapture will any of the foolish virgin
[2:11:56] be saved or will they all be lost
[2:11:59] now I see everything will be finished
[2:12:01] for the Gentile Church
[2:12:03] when the bride is taken from the Earth
[2:12:05] when the bride is taken from the Earth
[2:12:08] Christ leaves the sanctuary's day of
[2:12:10] mediatorial is over
[2:12:13] Rapture comes he leaves from the
[2:12:16] sanctuary Goes Forth takes the book of
[2:12:18] redemption
[2:12:20] and claims everything he redeemed
[2:12:22] no more mediatorial work
[2:12:25] how many understand that
[2:12:28] I got it in one of the seals yeah the
[2:12:31] seals
[2:12:32] and Christ comes forth to claim
[2:12:35] his mediatorial work
[2:12:39] watch this
[2:12:41] the seed is not air with the shut
[2:12:44] that's why the Rapture the bride
[2:12:47] the White's virgin the called out the
[2:12:49] four ordained the elected
[2:12:52] God knew before the foundation of the
[2:12:54] world who would be saved and who would
[2:12:56] not be saved by predestination by
[2:12:58] foreknowledge he saw every member put
[2:13:01] every name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:13:03] before the church ever began
[2:13:05] Jesus come to save and to seek and save
[2:13:08] that which was on that book he bought
[2:13:11] the book of redemption it was lost and
[2:13:14] he redeemed us and all the names that
[2:13:16] was on that book was redeemed when he
[2:13:19] redeemed it
[2:13:23] it is the mystery of Christ in the
[2:13:25] church the resurrection Factor already
[2:13:28] inside of every elec seed now watch this
[2:13:34] Lord show us the father and it suffices
[2:13:37] up
[2:13:38] I have you to do with the tree you take
[2:13:41] the tree you plant it in the ground
[2:13:44] and then you have to water it and as you
[2:13:47] water it it doesn't do nothing but drink
[2:13:48] drink
[2:13:50] has to drink more than its portion
[2:13:54] and the more it drinks the bigger it
[2:13:56] swells up
[2:13:57] just pushes out limbs
[2:14:00] then it pushes out leaves then it pushes
[2:14:02] out blossoms then it pushes out apples
[2:14:05] is that right that's the way a Christian
[2:14:07] is
[2:14:09] we are planted together in Christ Jesus
[2:14:11] who is the inexhaustible Fountain of
[2:14:14] Life we are planted in Christ and we
[2:14:16] just drink drink and push out everything
[2:14:18] that we have need of for the Earthly
[2:14:21] Journey

[2:16:43] we're the head of the family the man the
[2:16:45] bridegroom
[2:16:46] the bride being the body of the
[2:16:48] bridegroom must follow the bride because
[2:16:50] that's the head and the head is re and
[2:16:53] the head is revealed and come back with
[2:16:55] eternal life and the body must follow
[2:16:57] that because it's husband and wife
[2:16:59] somebody say Amen to that
[2:17:09] the wisdom men cannot produce this
[2:17:12] the teaching of the prophet's message
[2:17:15] cannot produce it
[2:17:18] you can teach all you want you can show
[2:17:21] this and that and you can say first pull
[2:17:23] second pull you can show all this you
[2:17:25] can put the graphs up here you can have
[2:17:27] all the timelines chronology and unless
[2:17:30] the holy spirit makes it real to you you
[2:17:32] sit there and go
[2:17:37] but when it's revealed to you
[2:17:39] I love to see Revelation strike somebody
[2:17:42] it's like a little kid in school the
[2:17:45] teacher teaches
[2:17:48] and no matter how good the teacher is
[2:17:51] until the student oh oh I mean it's
[2:17:54] amazing
[2:17:56] the teacher will say do you all
[2:17:58] understand that
[2:18:00] and there'll be just a few yeah yeah I
[2:18:02] get it is there any of you that don't
[2:18:04] understand it and you that sat there and
[2:18:07] didn't catch it
[2:18:08] are too embarrassed to say would you
[2:18:12] say that over again I don't get it
[2:18:14] because everybody else
[2:18:16] stupid Ronald
[2:18:17] el stupido
[2:18:21] no comprende
[2:18:23] the guy don't get it
[2:18:25] but you know what's nice is all of those
[2:18:29] around you that didn't get it when that
[2:18:31] guy raised his hand would you explain it
[2:18:33] again they're all going
[2:18:35] I'm glad he did it I'm glad he took the
[2:18:39] embarrassment
[2:18:42] so if you don't get it I'm here to tell
[2:18:44] you I'll say God go over it one more
[2:18:46] time God reveal it to me God let your
[2:18:50] word speak to me again and again and I
[2:18:54] can't and he will rehearse these things
[2:18:56] again and again it's a Time release
[2:19:00] revelation
[2:19:07] um
[2:19:14] the resurrection factor is already
[2:19:16] inside every one of the elect seed
[2:19:18] the third pull is that quickening power
[2:19:20] within every elect seed it's the
[2:19:22] revelation of the word of God made known
[2:19:25] in its season
[2:19:30] the unfailing words of Promise how many
[2:19:32] you remember that I told you that the
[2:19:33] angel of the Lord and that Pillar of
[2:19:35] Fire
[2:19:36] that met me up there and told me if I'd
[2:19:38] be sincere
[2:19:40] it would come to pass and I would know
[2:19:42] the very secret of the heart
[2:19:46] let me take this a step further
[2:19:49] if you'll
[2:19:51] be more sincere
[2:19:54] you will know the secret of God's heart
[2:19:59] hmm
[2:20:09] he revealed the secrets of your heart
[2:20:12] but the third pool reveals the secrets
[2:20:19] God speak to me
[2:20:21] words of wisdom
[2:20:24] speak unto me in night visions give me
[2:20:28] things give me Revelation whisper in my
[2:20:31] ear
[2:20:33] Hallelujah when you whisper those great
[2:20:36] secrets you know what's amazing about
[2:20:38] when you're in an elevator
[2:20:41] and everybody can be talking
[2:20:44] and everybody but if you lean over to
[2:20:47] your friend and say hey
[2:20:51] everybody shuts up
[2:20:59] this is that third pole
[2:21:01] the mystery of God is now being made
[2:21:04] known to the bride she's catching it why
[2:21:08] this is our time this is our season I'm
[2:21:11] not putting it off to another day

[2:22:26] as John was called to come up hither
[2:22:30] all right I'm going to pass a few things
[2:22:32] here
[2:22:34] Colossians I want you to turn with me to
[2:22:36] Colossians 3 verses 1 through 3. brother
[2:22:39] and I'm passing up Colossians 2.
[2:22:43] if he then be risen with Christ
[2:22:47] seek those things which are above
[2:22:51] where Christ sitteth on the right hand
[2:22:53] of God
[2:22:55] said your affections on things above
[2:22:58] are you listening to me
[2:23:01] not on the things of this Earth
[2:23:04] for ye are dead and your life is hid
[2:23:07] with Christ in God
[2:23:11] now you see what the resurrection Factor
[2:23:13] the C Gene this Gene of God is all about
[2:23:18] his affections and his desires
[2:23:21] will be turned that elect seed will be
[2:23:25] turned to his affection and his desire
[2:23:29] seek first the kingdom of God in his
[2:23:32] righteousness all these other things
[2:23:34] will be given to you
[2:23:37] but it's no longer you doing it
[2:23:41] but it's Christ in you
[2:23:43] Galatians 2 verse 20. I'm crucified
[2:23:47] with Christ nevertheless I live
[2:23:51] how can you have a death
[2:23:54] and a living
[2:23:56] I am crucified with Christ nevertheless
[2:23:59] I live
[2:24:01] yet not I
[2:24:04] but Christ liveth in me
[2:24:07] and the life which I now live in the
[2:24:10] flesh
[2:24:11] I live by the faith of the son of God
[2:24:15] who loved me and gave himself for me
[2:24:18] in closing now musicians if you come
[2:24:25] Lazarus was a resurrected man
[2:24:32] when Jesus came to the tomb of Lazarus
[2:24:37] he said Lazarus come forth
[2:24:40] brother Branham says an astounding
[2:24:42] statement he said if he had just said
[2:24:44] come forth
[2:24:46] all of the Dead had to come up
[2:24:50] but he identified with his voice Lazarus
[2:24:54] come here
[2:24:57] Lazarus
[2:25:02] engraved clothes
[2:25:09] imagine him standing there
[2:25:12] Jesus said I am
[2:25:16] the resurrection
[2:25:19] Lazarus had the resurrection in him
[2:25:24] his nose had caved in his body decayed
[2:25:28] and began to sting
[2:25:31] but when God said Lazarus
[2:25:36] [Music]

[2:25:48] sometimes resurrected people still sting
[2:25:51] but yeah
[2:25:56] they get complexes they're wrapped in
[2:25:59] grave clothes

[2:30:29] that's what the ministry of Jesus Christ
[2:30:31] in every one of you
[2:30:34] is to lose people
[2:30:37] pray with people to have understanding
[2:30:40] why some of them still carry around with
[2:30:43] them complexes and different grave
[2:30:46] clothes
[2:30:48] because they've never been loosed
[2:30:51] Jesus spoke to the family loose him
