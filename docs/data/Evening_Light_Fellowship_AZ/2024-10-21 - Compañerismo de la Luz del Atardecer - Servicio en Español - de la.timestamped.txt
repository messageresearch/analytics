[50:28] Deuteronomio
[50:30] Deuteronomio Quién predica Deuteronomio
[50:34] Entonces yo encontré esta escritura
[50:37] discúlpenme que dice Porque yo he
[50:41] escogido mi pueblo porque no Porque eran
[50:43] grandes en número sino porque son mis
[50:46] amados Escogidos y yo supe que allí
[50:48] mismo que yo tenía un canal para
[50:50] predicar y entonces yo pensé que los
[50:54] servicios se habían terminado y una hora
[50:57] Med después yo
[51:01] prediquen de Dios y yo allí me di cuenta
[51:05] yo me di cuenta padre llega un tiempo

[51:22] se agote y dice ya ya ya ya terminaste
[51:25] ya terminaste ya ya no tengo nada Ahora
[51:27] puedo puedo hablar ahora yo Oh muy bien
[51:30] muy bien entonces Esta es la manera que
[51:34] comenzó es como es es bueno de tener a
[51:39] alguien aquí de Paul
[51:41] Petro es es como es como una boda Yo me
[51:47] relajo Me relajo mientras estoy aquí

[58:20] Jesús la gracia de nuestro señor
[58:23] Jesucristo sea con todos vosotros
[58:26] Amén amén
[58:29] amén regresando vamos a Apocalipsis
[58:37] 10
[58:39] Apocalipsis 10 una porción muy familiar
[58:42] de la escritura que la
[58:45] quisiera erla en esta mañana para
[58:47] ustedes Apocalipsis 10 17 al
[58:52] 11 sino que en los días de la voz del
[58:55] Séptimo Ángel
[58:56] cuando él comience a tocar la trompeta
[59:00] el hermano branam dijo no cuando él
[59:03] comienza su
[59:04] ministerio pero cuando él comienza a
[59:07] sonar el misterio a hablar el misterio
[59:11] el misterio de Dios se consumar como él
[59:15] lo anunció a su siervo los profetas y la
[59:18] voz que del oí del cielo hablaba
[59:21] conmigo conmigo y dijo ve y toma el
[59:25] librito que está abierto en la mano del
[59:27] Ángel que está en pie sobre el mar y
[59:30] sobre la Tierra y fui al ángel
[59:33] diciéndole que me diese el
[59:36] librito y él me dijo toma y cómelo y te
[59:40] amargar el vientre el vientre pero en tu
[59:44] boca será dulce como la miel entonces
[59:47] tomé el librito de la mano del Ángel y
[59:50] lo comí y era dulce en mi boca como la
[59:54] miel pero cuando lo hube comido amargó
[59:58] mi vientre y él me dijo Es necesario que
[1:00:02] profetices otra vez sobre muchos pueblos
[1:00:06] naciones lenguas y
[1:00:09] Reyes Que el Señor bendiga la lectura de
[1:00:12] su palabra pueden tomar asiento en esta
[1:00:14] mañana en la presencia del
[1:00:18] Señor Ahora yo quiero que ustedes noten
[1:00:21] que fue
[1:00:23] después que El séptimo el mensaje
[1:00:26] Mensajero del Séptimo Ángel hubo
[1:00:28] terminado y fue después que el misterio
[1:00:32] de Dios había sido predicado que
[1:00:35] predicado que la voz le habló a
[1:00:38] Juan y y Juan es un tipo de la novia Yo
[1:00:42] quiero que usted cante capte la
[1:00:46] coordinación come toma y come la palabra
[1:00:50] revelada porque es comida espiritual a
[1:00:54] tiempo Juan diente y él tomó y comió el
[1:00:58] libro y él no
[1:01:03] solamente almacenó las cintas Pero hay
[1:01:06] una concepción de qué sirve este mensaje
[1:01:09] puesto nada más en un estante en una
[1:01:13] repisa de qué
[1:01:15] sirve tiene que ser tomado y ser
[1:01:18] consumido porque cuando usted lo que
[1:01:21] usted consuma es lo que usted va a venir
[1:01:24] a hacer Jesús dijo las palabras que yo
[1:01:26] os hablo son espíritu y son
[1:01:31] vida no es solamente tomar las cintas y
[1:01:34] los libros y
[1:01:37] distribuirlos o no solamente decir yo
[1:01:41] estoy de acuerdo con ell usted tiene que
[1:01:43] tomarlo y comerlo tómelo y coma tomad y
[1:01:47] comed esto es mi cuerpo que por vosotros
[1:01:50] es partido porque tenemos que que
[1:01:54] profesar
[1:01:56] ministerio ha terminado de este Ángel yo
[1:01:59] quiero que ustedes se den cuenta hay un
[1:02:00] cambio de administración no es el ángel
[1:02:04] del cielo no es El séptimo Ángel pero
[1:02:07] ahora el Ministerio está cambiando ahora
[1:02:10] vino a Juan Juan Juan La Voz fue
[1:02:15] Apocalipsis 101 el Ángel poderoso esa
[1:02:18] voz dio la vivifica de Apocalipsis 17 y
[1:02:23] él predicó el misterio de Dios pero Juan
[1:02:26] tú tienes que tomar este librito tienes
[1:02:29] que tomar este mensaje y como yo
[1:02:33] prediques dos servicios entr el entrando
[1:02:37] dentro de la visión Estos no son credos
[1:02:39] y dogmas o o
[1:02:43] o orden de
[1:02:45] iglesia credos y dogmas sino esto es una
[1:02:48] visión Esta es una visión de Dios porque
[1:02:51] un profeta ve él tiene una visión que
[1:02:55] viene de Dios y él lo habla porque él es
[1:02:59] la boca de Dios Entonces es una visión y
[1:03:03] cuando usted toma se toma a usted mismo
[1:03:07] y si usted y usted se une con esta
[1:03:09] visión lo que usted hace usted está de
[1:03:12] acuerdo con ella noten así como fue con
[1:03:15] María Así será con la novia Yo quiero
[1:03:19] que entiendan que este Ángel no tenía
[1:03:22] ayuda para sino traer que sino hacer que
[1:03:25] la promesa viniera acontecimiento hasta
[1:03:28] que ella dijo con su voz sea hágase
[1:03:31] conmigo de acuerdo a tu palabra yo
[1:03:34] quiero que todos ustedes entiendan que
[1:03:36] esto no es algo que usted se siente y se
[1:03:39] relaja se se y lo pone de una manera
[1:03:42] mental pero usted tiene que en su
[1:03:44] corazón decir permite que Esta profecía
[1:03:47] ponla en mi pecho que entre en el
[1:03:51] vientre de mi m de mi mente y que yo
[1:03:53] pueda concebir y traer la vida que yo
[1:03:56] debo de traer Hazme sombra
[1:04:01] señor Entonces ahora observen la voz del
[1:04:06] Ángel poderoso como él le transfiere le
[1:04:09] pasa al mensajero terrestre al ángel
[1:04:12] mensajero y la voz se se transporta a la
[1:04:16] voz de Juan es Es el mismo Dios es el
[1:04:20] mismo mensaje el cual él está usando
[1:04:23] pero él está usando otra voz y ahora yo
[1:04:27] quiero intitular mi sermón mi servicio
[1:04:29] esta mañana la voz final de Dios en los
[1:04:32] últimos días en el último día Yo quiero
[1:04:35] yo quiero tomar como tema el Ministerio
[1:04:39] de la novia Cuántos de ustedes creen que
[1:04:42] ustedes han se han Unido se han juntado
[1:04:46] con este mensaje ha habido una Unión una
[1:04:50] Unión actual con él y por lo tanto usted
[1:04:54] se ha unido ya con
[1:04:57] Cristo Y entonces ahora esa Unión lo ha
[1:05:03] traído un un despertamiento un poder de
[1:05:07] transformación a cada uno de ustedes
[1:05:09] Entonces ustedes tienen que jugar su
[1:05:11] parte no es solamente decir verbalmente
[1:05:14] Yo estoy de acuerdo con esto sino Usted
[1:05:16] tiene que ser uno con este mensaje ahora
[1:05:19] estamos en el tiempo donde el enemigo va
[1:05:22] a hacer todo lo que él pueda para parar
[1:05:25] esta voz el hermano branam dijo ustedes
[1:05:29] pueden pueden as silenciar la voz
[1:05:33] ustedes pero nunca van a poder a
[1:05:34] silenciar el mensaje porque el mensaje
[1:05:36] es Cristo ustedes van a poder callar
[1:05:38] esta voz pero no el mensaje entonces
[1:05:41] estamos en el tiempo del fin y el
[1:05:43] está haciendo todo lo que él pueda para
[1:05:46] detener la voz final y como ya he dicho
[1:05:49] me gustaría sustanciar esta mañana que
[1:05:52] El séptimo Ángel no es la él no es la
[1:05:56] voz final El séptimo Ángel él solamente
[1:05:59] es una parte de la
[1:06:01] Fórmula él es parte de la ecuación que
[1:06:05] Dios está usando para este tiempo del
[1:06:08] fin pero su voz le da vida a otra voz y
[1:06:12] la voz de usted se conecta con la voz de
[1:06:15] él y Ed viene a ser la voz final Amén
[1:06:19] entonces en la edad de la odisea el
[1:06:22] hermano branam dijo en la iglesia en la
[1:06:26] si podemos considerar la iglesia qué tan
[1:06:29] qué tan preciso este pensamiento en Las
[1:06:32] edades oscuras la palabra casi se perdió
[1:06:35] enteramente para la gente pero Dios
[1:06:37] envió a Lutero con la palabra los
[1:06:40] luteranos no no no solamente Lutero no
[1:06:44] solamente El mensajero los luteranos
[1:06:47] hablaron de Dios acerca en aquel tiempo
[1:06:50] acerca de Dios pero se organizaron y
[1:06:52] otra vez la palabra pura se perdió y se
[1:06:55] organizó
[1:06:57] y enviaron a dogmas a credos y no a la
[1:07:00] simple palabra ellos ya no podían hablar
[1:07:02] más por Dios Entonces Dios envió a
[1:07:05] Wesley y él fue la voz con la palabra en
[1:07:08] su día y la gente quienes tomaron la
[1:07:11] revelación de Dios vinieron a ser
[1:07:13] aquellas epístolas vivas leídas
[1:07:16] conocidas de todos los hombres para su
[1:07:19] generación están mirando ustedes este
[1:07:21] patrón y cuando los metod metodistas
[1:07:24] cayeron Dios levantó a
[1:07:26] otro y otros se fueron a través de los
[1:07:29] años hasta los últimos hasta el último
[1:07:32] día y Entonces comenzó allí otro pueblo
[1:07:34] en la tierra quienes estuvieron bajo
[1:07:37] este mensajero entienden estos quienes
[1:07:39] estuvieron bajo este mensajero porque
[1:07:41] nosotros nos damos cuenta que Dios envió
[1:07:43] un profeta él es nuestro mensajero no
[1:07:45] estamos buscando un octavo mensajero
[1:07:47] nosotros tuvimos El mensajero séptimo
[1:07:50] mensajero pero nosotros estamos
[1:07:52] esperando que otro tome esa misma
[1:07:54] palabra aquí en cuyo por ese mismo
[1:07:57] mensaje sea la voz final a la edad final
[1:08:01] le estoy de estoy Lo siento de estar en
[1:08:04] desacuerdo con otros que se quedan en la
[1:08:06] casa y nada más tocan cinta porque
[1:08:09] porque ellos escuchan la voz de Dios y
[1:08:11] ellos están negando a otra voz que que
[1:08:15] va a venir Está negando la palabra de
[1:08:16] Dios y la la voz de Dios va a ser
[1:08:18] completada yo digo yo digo señor Haz con
[1:08:21] nosotros de acuerdo a tu palabra hágase
[1:08:23] con nosotros de acuerdo a tu palabra
[1:08:24] digo yo
[1:08:26] Amén en Éxodo en Éxodo 23 Éxodo 23 el
[1:08:32] profeta de Dios usa la escritura en
[1:08:35] cuatro en varias diferentes e aquí yo
[1:08:40] envío un ángel delante de ti para que te
[1:08:47] guarde escucha su palabra su su
[1:08:52] voz no os provoquéis
[1:09:02] pero escucharás su palabra y todo lo que
[1:09:05] hablo y yo ser enemigo a vuestros
[1:09:10] enemigos y adversario a vuestros
[1:09:13] adversarios porque mi ángel irá delante
[1:09:16] de
[1:09:23] ti Jehová
[1:09:27] y los y no te postrarás a sus dioses ni
[1:09:32] los
[1:09:33] servirás irás tras sus obras pero pero
[1:09:38] tú los echarás
[1:09:40] fuera y los y destrozará sus imágenes el
[1:09:44] hermano branam usó este sermón en un
[1:09:46] texto
[1:09:48] esta por en 14 diferentes mensajes
[1:09:52] enfatizando que cuando Dios envía un
[1:09:54] mensajero
[1:09:56] tenemos que se tiene que obedecer a su
[1:10:00] voz Dios siempre ha tenido una voz y una
[1:10:05] representación él lo ha hecho desde el
[1:10:08] mero tiempo del jardín del Edén Dios
[1:10:11] siempre tiene creyentes en algún lugar
[1:10:13] en los cuales él puede usar sus voces y
[1:10:17] cuando el profeta deja la escena un
[1:10:20] profeta deja la escena Dios ya está
[1:10:21] preparando a otro no no o uno en
[1:10:26] cuerpo Entonces se le mandó a Juan que
[1:10:29] tomara el libro de redención y que lo
[1:10:32] comiera y después que él participó del
[1:10:35] mensaje en es su hora Fue entonces fue
[1:10:38] su tiempo para hablar ahora tienes que
[1:10:41] profetizar a los pueblos no no fue El
[1:10:44] séptimo Ángel profetizando fue Juan fue
[1:10:47] a la novia hermano y hermana Nosotros
[1:10:50] tenemos una obra que hacer en este
[1:10:52] tiempo tenemos la palabra de Dios
[1:10:56] tenemos que consumir la palabra de Dios
[1:10:58] dentro de nosotros y cuando nosotros la
[1:11:01] consumimos ella nos consume a nosotros
[1:11:03] no es usted la palabra en usted ahora
[1:11:06] viviéndola viviendo en usted y haciendo
[1:11:08] una manifestación de Cristo en esta
[1:11:13] hora así como Juan se le dijo que tomar
[1:11:16] el libro a nosotros también se nos

[1:11:53] usted la Biblia dice en di 22 el espí y
[1:11:57] el espíritu y la novia dicen ven el
[1:12:00] espíritu y la novia ambos dicen la misma
[1:12:03] cosa esta es la hora y el tiempo donde
[1:12:06] Nosotros hemos Unido nuestra voz con
[1:12:09] nuestro con el espíritu y ahora estamos
[1:12:12] diciendo la misma cosa miren esto en el
[1:12:15] verdadero sello de la Pascua el hermano
[1:12:16] branam dijo si usted se da cuenta que
[1:12:19] tan pronto la voz de Abel fue silenciada
[1:12:22] Dios levantó a s para que tomara lugar
[1:12:25] lo cual es no es otra sino es la es eh
[1:12:29] eh es la resurrección que
[1:12:32] vino entonces Esto fue así por un
[1:12:35] momento a través del Antiguo Testamento
[1:12:37] nosotros lo vemos a través de los
[1:12:40] Profetas Dios mantuvo esta voz viva
[1:12:44] ellos hablaron la palabra y ellos los
[1:12:47] apedrearon y Tan pronto como la palabra
[1:12:50] fue
[1:12:51] apedreada Dios levantó a otro y y ellos
[1:12:56] lo apedrearon y lo quitaron y Dios
[1:13:00] levantó a otro a otro siempre ha tenido
[1:13:04] testigos todado a través de las edades
[1:13:07] él ha tenido una voz viva Dios mientras
[1:13:11] Dios Dios ha guardado su palabra y ha
[1:13:14] tenido una representación en cada edad y
[1:13:16] en cada hora nosotros no tenemos que
[1:13:18] mirar hacia atrás a la voz del Séptimo
[1:13:20] Ángel allá atrás Oh me decir Oh me
[1:13:23] gustaría haber estado allá me gusta
[1:13:25] garía haber estado en las reuniones no
[1:13:26] nosotros tenemos esas cintas y nosotros
[1:13:29] podemos escucharlas y podemos entrar en
[1:13:31] ellas pero esta voz no ha parado Y
[1:13:35] aunque se fue de la escena en
[1:13:37] 1965 esta voz aún continúa Amén es un es
[1:13:43] es una
[1:13:44] transformación ahora ahora está está
[1:13:48] entrando en otra administración Quién es
[1:13:51] es la novia Ella está llegando señor
[1:13:55] Jesús dijo yo tengo much yo tengo aún
[1:13:57] muchas cosas que quiero deciros pero
[1:14:00] ahora no las podréis no las podéis
[1:14:02] sobrellevar pero una vez que yo me vaya
[1:14:05] el espíritu santo os traerá todas estas
[1:14:08] cosas a memoria y ustedes van a
[1:14:11] comprender van a entender Aleluya ahora
[1:14:13] Estamos mismo en el tiempo donde todas
[1:14:16] estas cintas y libros y la palabra
[1:14:19] profética ha sido predicada y ahora
[1:14:22] estamos llegando al entendimiento Por
[1:14:24] qué es predicó hace años atrás en los 70
[1:14:28] cuando yo primeramente vine a este
[1:14:30] mensaje todo era profeta profeta profeta
[1:14:33] Apocalipsis 10 Aleluya profeta profeta
[1:14:37] profeta y por años usted iba a una
[1:14:40] convención y todos decían ahora ahora
[1:14:42] Dios envió un profeta Aleluya todos nos
[1:14:46] excitaban pero una vez que usted
[1:14:48] entendió que Dios envió un profeta esto
[1:14:50] ya no lo estimula usted ya más Solamente
[1:14:53] usted diga lo que él dice Dígame lo que
[1:14:56] él
[1:14:57] dijo entonces ahora ahora estamos en el
[1:15:01] tiempo el profeta ha venido y se ha ido
[1:15:05] él predicó su ministerio su ministerio
[1:15:09] Terrenal ya se terminó pero aún yo creo
[1:15:13] que esta voz todavía continúa yo creo
[1:15:16] que la misma voz de inspiración que
[1:15:20] estaba en William branam ahora está
[1:15:23] viniendo a la novia es el espíritu santo
[1:15:27] y ahora el espíritu está tomando otra
[1:15:31] voz y
[1:15:32] ella ella va a ser la voz final a a la
[1:15:36] edad final usted no puedo hacer no puede
[1:15:39] hacerlo de otra
[1:15:43] manera el hermano br dijo en la voz de
[1:15:47] Dios
[1:15:48] 1963 puede ser que usted no tenga una
[1:15:52] oportunidad esta noche o tenga una opun
[1:15:55] mañana es ahora Cuando escuche escucha
[1:15:58] mi voz no endurezcáis vuestro corazón
[1:16:01] como los días de la provocación ahora es
[1:16:03] el tiempo Este es el tiempo
[1:16:06] aceptable que si algún hombre escucha mi
[1:16:10] voz esto también va a mostrar que su voz
[1:16:14] Todavía está en
[1:16:16] su en los medios de todo a través de
[1:16:20] todo el caos él todavía tiene una voz
[1:16:23] por qué su voz va a permanecer Aquí está
[1:16:28] cielos y tierra pasarán pero mi voz no
[1:16:31] pasará su palabra Amén y Ezequiel capta
[1:16:37] esto también yo quiero compartir esto
[1:16:39] con ustedes dice en Ezequiel 43 verso 2
[1:16:43] aquí la gloria del señor vino de Israel
[1:16:47] vino del este y su voz era como una como
[1:16:51] voz de muchas aguas y la tierra brilló
[1:16:55] con su gloria resplandeció con su gloria
[1:16:58] aquí entonces aquí estaba la gloria de
[1:17:00] Dios que vino a Israel entonces estaba
[1:17:04] estaba viniendo del este yendo al este
[1:17:06] del este al oeste como el sol que se
[1:17:09] levanta en el este y se oculta en el
[1:17:11] oeste entonces la es la gloria de Dios
[1:17:14] vino en el oeste y ahora va caminando
[1:17:17] hacia el oeste y esta voz era como un
[1:17:21] Como ruido de muchas aguas ahora Juan en
[1:17:24] la isla de Patmos en Apocalipsis 1 él
[1:17:28] miró la revelación Apocalipsis 1 1 y yo
[1:17:32] me volteé para ver la voz que hablaba
[1:17:34] conmigo él estaba escuchando una voz Yo
[1:17:37] me volteé para ver esta voz y y yo miré
[1:17:41] siete
[1:17:42] candeleros y en medio de los siete
[1:17:45] candeleros uno como el hijo del hombre
[1:17:49] vestido con vestiduras hasta sus pies y
[1:17:53] y ceñido
[1:17:55] con y su cabello su pelo era como Blanca
[1:18:00] lana blanca como la nieve y sus ojos
[1:18:03] como llamas de fuego y sus pies eran
[1:18:06] como como bronce bruñido que que es este
[1:18:11] resplandeciente como en un horno y su
[1:18:13] voz era como de muchas aguas y él tenía
[1:18:16] a su diestra siete estrellas y de su
[1:18:19] boca salía una espada aguda de como de
[1:18:22] dos filos y su era como cuando el sol
[1:18:27] resplandece en su mera fuerza él tenía
[1:18:29] siete estrellas y en su mano derecha é
[1:18:32] tenía siete estrellas estos eran los
[1:18:34] siete Ángeles El mensajero que el cual
[1:18:37] Nosotros sabemos que es una estrella
[1:18:39] mensajero para esta edad y su ministerio
[1:18:43] fue vindicado
[1:18:45] allí allí en el cañón Sabino cuando él
[1:18:49] estaba allí orando acerca de una visión
[1:18:52] yo quiero que ustedes entiendan estas
[1:18:54] Visión acerca de Dios viniendo a él él
[1:18:57] miró siete Ángeles poderosos poderosos y
[1:19:00] hubo una explosión él se preguntaba Qué
[1:19:03] significa esto quiere decir esto que él
[1:19:05] me va a llevar fuera de la escena y Si
[1:19:07] eso fuera así Entonces él dijo señor Qué
[1:19:10] es esta visión Y di un de repente él
[1:19:13] dijo algo algo cayó sobre mi mano qué
[1:19:16] era Era una espada no no era la espada
[1:19:19] de un rey sino la espada de El Rey qué
[1:19:22] estaba haciendo Dios él dijo esta no
[1:19:24] este no es este no es el fin de tu
[1:19:27] ministerio Esta es la vindicación de tu
[1:19:30] ministerio Este es el tercer jalón El
[1:19:33] tercer jalón es es esa espada afilada de
[1:19:37] dos filos es que atraviesa el alma y y
[1:19:42] divina divide hasta los tuétanos alguien
[1:19:46] diga Amén A eso es la espada que que
[1:19:48] discierne y penetra hasta lo más
[1:19:51] profundo Dios todavía está ando la voz
[1:19:55] de su
[1:19:57] ministerio Pero y no solamente el
[1:19:59] Ministerio pero a quién pero a Quiénes
[1:20:03] les está
[1:20:05] administrando y cuando cuando su voz la
[1:20:08] voz de usted se une con las otras voces
[1:20:11] viene a hacer un sonido de muchas aguas
[1:20:14] hacer un ruido el hermano branam dijo
[1:20:17] Cuál es el sonido El ruido de es Qué
[1:20:19] significa el ruido de todas estas aguas
[1:20:22] en la visión de Patmos todo esto tiene
[1:20:25] que ver con el mensaje es Dios revelando
[1:20:28] a un profeta la visión Entonces él está
[1:20:31] hablando acerca de la visión de padmos
[1:20:34] El hermano branam Lo capta por medio de
[1:20:36] revelación de el Ángel viniendo a él
[1:20:39] Entonces él empieza a entender los
[1:20:41] símbolos miren por causa del tiempo
[1:20:45] Solamente voy a leer las porciones
[1:20:47] iluminadas el sonido de muchas aguas la
[1:20:50] voz voz de muchas aguas qué Qué
[1:20:53] representan las aguas si usted quiere
[1:20:56] marcarlo vaya en
[1:20:58] apocalipsis ve
[1:21:00] las aguas eran multitudes gentes y
[1:21:05] lenguas ahora la voz de muchas aguas Qué
[1:21:08] es su voz es el
[1:21:10] juicio la voz de los ministros a través
[1:21:14] del espíritu santo que claman a la gente
[1:21:17] en cada edad que están ellos se paran
[1:21:20] allí la voz de muchas aguas clamaron
[1:21:23] entre multitudes de pueblos la voz de
[1:21:25] los siete estrellas que fueron enviadas
[1:21:28] a cada edad de la iglesia predicando el
[1:21:30] bautismo del Espíritu Santo El bautismo
[1:21:33] en el nombre del señor Jesucristo hablar
[1:21:34] en lenguas el poder de Dios la
[1:21:36] resurrección de Cristo la segunda venida

[1:21:45] el hijo del hombre muchas aguas ven mi
[1:21:48] hermano y mi hermana es es un espíritu
[1:21:52] nicolaita el cual trata de silenciar la
[1:21:55] voz de el Ministerio hoy en este
[1:22:01] día sería v v el el el le
[1:22:07] gustaría que usted parara esa voz de le
[1:22:10] garía parar la voz del Séptimo Ángel
[1:22:13] porque entonces usted no tendría ya más
[1:22:16] propósito usted ya no tendría colocación
[1:22:18] usted no tendría ningún ministerio y
[1:22:21] usted no podría unirse con la visión y
[1:22:23] ahora usted diría Oh gloria a dios
[1:22:25] solamente Dios envió un profeta y
[1:22:28] miramos señales y maravill y él hizo
[1:22:31] señales y maravillas pero mi hermano mi
[1:22:32] hermana la voz no ha parado no no no
[1:22:37] paró con Apocalipsis 17 todavía sigue
[1:22:39] caminando porque es una una voz de
[1:22:42] muchas aguas un sonido de muchas aguas
[1:22:45] porque hay hay más gente creyendo en
[1:22:47] este mensaje hoy en este día que cuando
[1:22:49] el hermano branam estuvo aquí lo
[1:22:52] predicó él
[1:22:54] él haya sido un profeta que murió de un
[1:22:57] con un corazón quebrantado rompido
[1:22:59] porque él captaba toda clase de
[1:23:01] revelaciones realmente para sustanciar
[1:23:04] que este era un mensaje del tiempo del
[1:23:09] fin Oh o algunos pocos hombres miraron
[1:23:14] que él tenía un gran Don a un hermano
[1:23:16] Billy Paul él dijo hermano ron no fue
[1:23:19] hasta que mi padre se fue de la escena
[1:23:21] que yo me di cuenta que él era El
[1:23:23] mensajero de la sed edad yo estaba
[1:23:26] estuve tan cerca de él yo miré Yo miré
[1:23:29] la humanidad de él Oh hermano muchas
[1:23:31] veces estamos tan cercanos los unos de
[1:23:33] los otros nos acercamos Tan tanto a este
[1:23:35] mensaje de Dios que solamente viene a
[1:23:38] ser simple para nosotros como un
[1:23:40] hermanos y hermanas deberíamos de darnos
[1:23:42] cuenta de que lo que Dios envió en este
[1:23:44] último tiempo un mensaje que él no vino
[1:23:47] solamente a hablar de él y leerlo sino
[1:23:50] que nosotros tenemos que entrar en él
[1:23:52] meternos a la revelación para que
[1:23:55] nosotros podamos manifestar la voz de
[1:23:57] Dios en esta misma hora que estamos
[1:23:59] viviendo que Dios nos
[1:24:02] ayude Ustedes han sido vivificados
[1:24:07] Dios ha levantado apártense del pecado y
[1:24:11] de la
[1:24:11] muerte para que puedan sentarse en
[1:24:14] lugares celestiales Ustedes han sido
[1:24:16] llamados de regreso a la palabra
[1:24:18] restaurada Ustedes han sido vivificados
[1:24:21] por la voz del Séptimo Ángel fue Dios
[1:24:23] hablando fue Dios
[1:24:30] vivifican la voces de los
[1:24:35] predicadores él trajo su propia vida de
[1:24:38] él pero usted tiene que llegar al punto
[1:24:42] de adopción él lo trajo a su su posición
[1:24:45] correcta en Cristo Jesús Jesús no
[1:24:47] terminó toda su obra cuando él estuvo
[1:24:50] aquí en la tierra él nos dejó una obra a
[1:24:52] nosotros la misma obra que yo hago
[1:24:55] vosotros también las haréis ahí hay un
[1:24:58] sucesor hay
[1:25:00] alguien hay alguien que va a llevar
[1:25:03] adelante el Ministerio la edad de
[1:25:05] pérgamo ven ven el padre y el hijo noten
[1:25:10] la armonía entre el padre y su hijo
[1:25:12] Jesús nunca hizo nada hasta que primero
[1:25:16] el padre se lo mostró Juan 5:19 el
[1:25:20] testimonio es ahora este entre el novio
[1:25:23] y la novia él mostró su palabra de vida
[1:25:27] y él y él lo recibe él nunca él nunca
[1:25:32] duda por lo tanto nada puede puede
[1:25:35] herirla a ella es tan simple como esto
[1:25:38] la palabra está en la novia así como
[1:25:41] estuvo en María la novia tiene la mente
[1:25:44] de Cristo porque ella sabe lo que él
[1:25:48] quiere que lo que él quiere que ella
[1:25:50] haga con la palabra él hace y manda su
[1:25:54] palabra en él Su nombre es dice así dice
[1:25:59] el Señor y él entonces la palabra es
[1:26:03] vivificada por el espíritu y viene
[1:26:06] acontecimiento como una una semilla que
[1:26:09] es plantada su novia solamente hará su
[1:26:12] voluntad nadie va a poder hacer que ella
[1:26:14] haga otra cosa ell Ellos tienen Así dice
[1:26:17] el Señor y se mantienen quietos Ellos
[1:26:19] saben que tiene que ser Dios en ellos
[1:26:21] haciendo las obras cumpliendo su propia
[1:26:25] él no completó toda su palabra cuando él
[1:26:28] estuvo aquí en su ministerio
[1:26:32] Terrenal ahora él obra a través de la
[1:26:36] novia en y a través de la novia están
[1:26:38] captando
[1:26:40] esto no paró allí con el mensaje del
[1:26:44] Séptimo Ángel no paró allí él
[1:26:47] dijo él no completó todas sus obras en
[1:26:50] este ministerio Terrenal Entonces ahora
[1:26:54] él está trabajando y en y a través de la
[1:26:57] novia Ella sabe
[1:27:00] eso porque no era tiempo para él para
[1:27:02] que hiciera ciertas cosas las cosas que
[1:27:04] él tiene que hacer
[1:27:06] ahora pero a él ahora va a cumplir a
[1:27:10] través de la novia el trabajo que él
[1:27:13] dejó para este tiempo específico él va a
[1:27:17] continuar en la
[1:27:18] novia Cuántos creen que nosotros estamos
[1:27:21] en este tiempo preciso hay tiempos y
[1:27:25] sazones y continúa repitiéndose a sí
[1:27:28] mismo nosotros lo hemos visto nosotros
[1:27:30] estamos entrando eh en la en el cambio
[1:27:33] de la sazón de de de de ahorita hojas
[1:27:36] cayendo nosotros estamos mirando las
[1:27:38] cosas que están aconteciendo aquí en la
[1:27:40] tierra Por qué Porque estamos mirando en
[1:27:42] la manifestación física alrededor de
[1:27:44] nosotros es Entonces esto está
[1:27:46] aconteciendo también en la novia estamos
[1:27:48] llegando a la sazón donde tenemos que
[1:27:51] movernos como la novia ya no más movidos
[1:27:55] para un lado y para otro por todo
[1:27:57] doctrina por todo moviento de miento de
[1:28:00] doctrina usted tiene que mantenerse
[1:28:01] sobre la palabra porque la palabra de
[1:28:03] Dios es nuestro absoluto si alguien y si
[1:28:06] alguien puede sacarlo a usted de lo que
[1:28:08] usted cree eso quiere decir que usted
[1:28:10] nunca recibió recibió
[1:28:13] revelación el una vez que usted
[1:28:16] sabe quién es usted y por qué propósito
[1:28:19] usted está aquí qué parte tiene que
[1:28:20] jugar usted aquí nadie puede tomar su
[1:28:22] lugar usted nadie lo puede sacar de aquí
[1:28:24] de ello de lo que usted cree usted tiene
[1:28:28] un lugar específico y un
[1:28:31] propósito el hermano branam ahora otra
[1:28:35] otra vez para ir un poquito más adelante
[1:28:38] en la edad de pérgamo ahora parémonos
[1:28:41] como como Josué y Caleb dentro así Josué
[1:28:46] quiere decir Jehová salva
[1:28:53] Salvador él representa el líder de el
[1:28:55] tiempo del fin que va a venir a la
[1:28:59] iglesia aún como Pablo vino como un
[1:29:02] líder original cal representa aquellos
[1:29:06] que se manier fiel con Josué fieles con
[1:29:09] Josué entonces usted tiene un líder del
[1:29:12] tiempo del fin y usted tiene a Caleb
[1:29:15] quien se mantuvo fiel a a a a Josué
[1:29:19] pienen Dios comenzó a Israel como una
[1:29:21] Virgen en su palabra Pero ellos hicieron
[1:29:23] algo diferente
[1:29:24] lo mismo ha hecho esta iglesia desde el
[1:29:27] tiempo del fin noten ahora como Dios no
[1:29:29] movió a a Israel o les permitió que
[1:29:33] entrasen a la tierra prometida hasta que
[1:29:36] llegó el tiempo preciso ahora la gente
[1:29:38] pueda puede tener pudieran haberle
[1:29:41] puesto presión a Josué Y la líder y que
[1:29:44] que le pudieran haber dicho Josué tú tú
[1:29:47] tú a la mejor has perdido tu comisión ya
[1:29:50] no tienes el poder que tenías antes
[1:29:52] úsalo y Oye de Dios y conoce la voz de
[1:29:55] Dios y esto pudiera Mostrar de que hay
[1:29:58] algo mal Allí Josué era un profeta
[1:30:02] enviado de Dios y él sabía que la
[1:30:04] promesa Era de Dios Entonces él esperó
[1:30:06] él esperó que Dios le mostrara para
[1:30:10] tomar la decisión Dios colocó todo el
[1:30:14] liderazgo en Josué porque él se quedó
[1:30:16] con la palabra Dios Dios podía confiar
[1:30:20] en Josué pero no en los otros entonces
[1:30:24] así se va a repetir en el tiempo del fin
[1:30:26] el mismo problema y las mismas presiones
[1:30:30] Entonces nosotros estamos viendo las
[1:30:32] mismas cosas que se están repitiendo
[1:30:33] pero si nosotros vemos estas cosas
[1:30:36] también nos damos cuenta que tiene que
[1:30:38] haber un sucesor para el tiempo de la
[1:30:41] voz de este último tiempo tiene que
[1:30:43] haber que capte alguien que capte la
[1:30:46] bandera yo no sé si alguna vez usted ha
[1:30:49] captado una carrera si ustedes son
[1:30:51] corredores la antorcha y el que es más
[1:30:54] corredor este lo ponen lo ponen al fin
[1:30:58] corredor más rápido y allí todos estos
[1:31:02] son buenos corredores que corren y Y si
[1:31:05] usted los mira cuando se pasan la
[1:31:07] antorcha el uno al otro muchas veces el
[1:31:10] hombre no está parado allí para que se
[1:31:12] la pasen para que le pone la mano para
[1:31:14] que se la se la Pon pero cuando él ve el
[1:31:16] corredor que viene él comienza é
[1:31:19] entonces comienza a alinearse y él se da
[1:31:21] cuenta él no está mirando de esta manera
[1:31:24] así no él está corriendo y cuando él
[1:31:26] corre él puse una mano pone una mano
[1:31:28] hacia atrás para que cuando para cuando
[1:31:32] se empareja la siguiente cosa él agarra
[1:31:34] su mano y entonces usted ve la bandera
[1:31:37] ahora que ha sido pasada al que va
[1:31:39] enfrente
[1:31:41] Aleluya cuando nosotros comenzamos a
[1:31:44] captar
[1:31:45] el el aparejamiento de aquellos que
[1:31:48] están corriendo con esta antorcha nos
[1:31:50] damos cuenta que no es tiempo de no es
[1:31:53] tiempo de pararnos es decir Vamos vamos
[1:31:55] vamos Apúrate dámela a mí no comienza
[1:31:57] usted corra usted corra usted corra y él
[1:31:59] se va y él lo va a alcanzar y le va a
[1:32:01] pasar la antorcha Y usted va a correr y
[1:32:03] Si alguna vez ha habido un tiempo de
[1:32:05] correr esa ahora corramos ahora eh la la
[1:32:08] antorcha ha sido pasada es nuestro
[1:32:10] trabajo correr

[1:32:24] Juan 14 verso 2 dice yo cierto cierto os
[1:32:28] digo que aquel que cree en mí las obras
[1:32:30] que yo hago Él las hará también y más y
[1:32:33] más y más grandes obras hará porque yo
[1:32:37] voy al padre Entonces nosotros vemos
[1:32:39] este patrón ahora nosotros vemos Juan
[1:32:42] Juan fue la voz de Dios
[1:32:45] clamando Juan era era la voz que clamaba
[1:32:49] en el desierto entonces vino vino otra
[1:32:51] voz pues la voz del señor Jesucristo
[1:32:54] y después que él se fue vino otra voz la
[1:32:58] voz de los discípulos me están mirando
[1:33:01] la voz nunca ha parado siempre va a
[1:33:04] tener una representación y ahora mismo
[1:33:06] es el tiempo cuando cuando él se lleva a
[1:33:09] uno de la escena o ya sea que lo maten
[1:33:12] lo destruyan o lo
[1:33:13] apedrean o él muera de alguna de muerte
[1:33:16] natural Entonces el dice yo he
[1:33:19] parado la voz Déjenme decirles ustedes
[1:33:22] nunca van a poder parar esta voz la voz
[1:33:24] Va a continuar Por qué Porque si es la
[1:33:26] voz de Dios no pueden matar a Dios es la
[1:33:29] voz de Dios no pueden matar a Dios usted
[1:33:31] no puede detener su voz la voz

[1:36:21] mí se acuerdan
[1:36:25] Elías como él trató de sacudirse a
[1:36:27] Eliseo recuerdan esto en Segunda de
[1:36:29] Reyes capítulo 2 donde vino y el señor
[1:36:33] se iba a llevar a Elías al cielo en un
[1:36:36] torbellino se
[1:36:40] acuerdan Elías fue con Elías a gilgal y
[1:36:44] le dijo Le dijo Eliseo Quédate aquí
[1:36:48] Elías le dijo el Señor me ha enviado a
[1:36:51] Betel Adivinen que
[1:36:54] dijo vive Jehová que no me voy a quedar
[1:36:57] aquí yo voy a ir
[1:37:02] contigo y le dijo tres veces Quédate
[1:37:05] aquí primer primera segunda y tercera
[1:37:09] vez Quédate aquí vive Jehová que no te
[1:37:12] dejaré vive vive yo no te dejaré vive
[1:37:16] Jehová y no te dejaré y y 50 de los
[1:37:19] Profetas vinieron a encontrarse con
[1:37:21] Eliseo y se pararon allí le dijeron no
[1:37:23] te no te das cuenta que tu maestro se va
[1:37:26] te va se van a se va a ser quitado
[1:37:28] callaos dijo callaos de este no no me
[1:37:32] digas nada Por qué Porque hay toda clase
[1:37:35] de voces en estos últimos tiempos te das
[1:37:37] cuenta que tú tienes que hacer esto
[1:37:39] tienes que hacer aquello solamente hay
[1:37:41] una sola voz y esta y ha sido ordenada
[1:37:44] por Dios para tornar sus corazones de
[1:37:46] ustedes de regreso a Dios Esta es la voz
[1:37:48] del Séptimo
[1:37:49] Ángel esto pero la voz no para allí
[1:37:52] continúa
[1:37:54] continúa y adivine en
[1:37:57] qué le dijo elas Le dijo qué quieres de
[1:38:00] mí En qué y qué te he hecho yo a ti Yo
[1:38:03] no sé pero te voy a decir pero cuando yo
[1:38:06] estaba arando mi tierra con los
[1:38:10] bueyes tú te fuiste yo tuve que hacer un
[1:38:13] sacrificio hoy y tú me dijiste ve con tu
[1:38:17] papá y tu mamá pero yo no hice nada es
[1:38:20] exactamente como usted y con amigo
[1:38:24] cuando nosotros nos cruzamos con este
[1:38:25] mensaje algo esto le hizo algo a usted
[1:38:29] usted ya no fue allá a su arado o con
[1:38:34] allá con su con sus huyes que Liceo le
[1:38:38] dijo Yo sé que me hicistes a mí Elías le
[1:38:41] dijo qué quieres Qué quieres de mí Yo
[1:38:42] quiero una doble porción de lo que tú
[1:38:44] tienes le dijo Eliseo Oh sí quieres una
[1:38:47] doble
[1:38:49] porción Oh una cosa dura has pedido pero
[1:38:52] si me vieres cuando yo me fuere Y
[1:38:56] entonces él cachó el manto él lo cachó
[1:38:59] cuando cayó y si me viere si me vieres
[1:39:02] cuando me fuere y y agarras el manto
[1:39:05] pero noten noten ustedes que usted la
[1:39:08] palabra de Dios que nosotros vamos a
[1:39:10] reir una doble porción también cuando
[1:39:13] usted ve a ese profeta que se va usted
[1:39:16] se da cuenta que él está dejando algo
[1:39:18] atrás usted lo capta y entonces usted
[1:39:21] agarra eso y usted dice dónde está el
[1:39:23] día de Elías Y usted ya no dice más en
[1:39:25] los días de Elías en los días de Elías
[1:39:27] no no este es nuestro día yo miré el día
[1:39:30] de Elías pero ahora es mi tiempo Este es
[1:39:33] mi mensaje ahora Usted tiene que tomar
[1:39:35] ese mismo manto que fue que cayó y lo
[1:39:38] tiene que
[1:39:39] tomar hilal actualmente Ese fue el punto
[1:39:43] de principio nos damos cuenta que todo
[1:39:46] ministerio empieza en algún lugar todo
[1:39:50] ministerio fue el punto de
[1:39:53] del Ministerio de
[1:39:55] Elías y actualmente gilgal quiere quiere
[1:39:59] decir algo que da vuelta algo que está
[1:40:02] girando que está dando vuelta el primer
[1:40:04] jalón fue fue a Betel lo cual quiere
[1:40:07] decir una casa ahora casa la casa de
[1:40:12] Dios es buena pero esto no cambia la
[1:40:15] vida de usted no cambia su
[1:40:17] vida Dios guo a Jacob a Betel correcto

[1:53:02] mantarraya Bueno entonces yo nadé para
[1:53:06] para afuera entonces yo dije yo no voy a

[1:53:32] dije yo no voy a poner mis pies en la
[1:53:33] tierra en la arena yo estaba nadando

[1:53:44] y entonces yo iba él me iba mirando Por
[1:53:47] qué está por qué estás arriba de la
[1:53:48] tabla y no caminas Entonces yo lo miraba
[1:53:50] así porque el hermano sabía que una voz
[1:53:53] le había dicho que iba a pisar una
[1:53:55] mantarraya
[1:53:58] entonces hermano
[1:54:02] Freddy di el siguiente paso y sentí bajo
[1:54:07] debajo como un pez así como
[1:54:11] resbaloso entonces su cola se se levantó
[1:54:15] y me cortó aquí aquí aquí en donde está
[1:54:18] mi tendón aquí entonces me atravesó el
[1:54:21] traje

[1:54:38] pueda mover el pie así de esta manera
[1:54:40] ahora ya casi ni podía caminar y todo lo
[1:54:44] y
[1:54:46] demás Ahora yo

[2:01:04] ahora mismo la novia de Cristo
[2:01:07] ciertamente es el mensaje de la
[2:01:10] hora se ha da usted cuenta que el
[2:01:12] mensaje de la hora es el Ministerio de

[2:01:59] ministerio Entonces el va a
[2:02:03] estorbar para que nosotros no entremos
[2:02:05] en nuestra posición lo
[2:02:08] ven yo nunca le pedí a Dios que me
[2:02:10] hiciera un
[2:02:12] ministro nunca le pedí a Dios que me
[2:02:15] hiciera un
[2:02:16] pastor yo sé esto que desde que yo vine
[2:02:19] a este mensaje
[2:02:22] mis ojos fueron abiertos a esto y yo yo
[2:02:25] lo
[2:02:27] amo yo lo
[2:02:29] amo yo llevé a mis hijos mi hija está
[2:02:35] aquí ahora ahora mismo aamos a México
[2:02:39] Mateo no está
[2:02:41] aquí lo llevé a México a Nuevo México no
[2:02:50] entendí yo que mis hijos lo miraran
[2:02:53] tenía tantas
[2:03:01] ganas y yo les dije tú no vas a hacer
[2:03:05] esto Mientras esté en mi casa porque mi
[2:03:07] casa y
[2:03:08] yo entonces los arrastré a la iglesia
[2:03:11] los llevé a la iglesia los llevé a
[2:03:16] convenciones todos tuvieron problemas de
[2:03:19] drogas porque anduvieron de aquí para
[2:03:20] allá y de allá para acá
[2:03:23] pero la manzana no cae lejos del
[2:03:37] árbol muchas veces nosotros como padres
[2:03:41] Ah con nuestros hijos los tratamos
[2:03:45] mientras estás en mi casa Tú vas a hacer
[2:03:48] lo que yo digo y voy vas a ir conmigo a
[2:03:51] donde va a ser conmigo A donde yo vaya
[2:03:53] per una vez que tú te salgas de la casa
[2:03:56] puedes hacer lo que quieras pero tienes
[2:03:58] que respetar mientras estés aquí en la
[2:03:59] cas en la casa vine a ser un poco muy
[2:04:02] legalista Sí sí lo hice porque yo
[2:04:05] pensaba que mi revelación iba a ser
[2:04:07] buena para ellos también no no no fue
[2:04:10] así no ellos necesitan su propia
[2:04:12] revelación y cuando ellos lo captan
[2:04:16] Usted no tiene que decirles qué hacer él
[2:04:18] les dice qué hacer
[2:04:21] dice que fue muy duro con sus hijos y en
[2:04:24] segunda de Timoteo 22 dice las cosas que
[2:04:29] han sido dichas entre yo y muchos
[2:04:31] testigos encomienda a hombres
[2:04:34] fieles que sean capaces de enseñar a
[2:04:37] otros
[2:04:39] también y estas cosas que habéis oído el
[2:04:42] hermano habr en la edad smirna y cada
[2:04:46] edad tiene el mismo patrón es por eso
[2:04:49] que la luz
[2:04:52] a través de
[2:04:53] mensajeros dados Dios y esos ciertos en
[2:04:58] estas ciertas áreas ellos reparten el
[2:05:01] mensaje el Ministerio la luz y la voz
[2:05:07] viene a aquellos que fielmente han sido
[2:05:09] enseñados pero claro No todos aquellos
[2:05:12] siempre aprenden
[2:05:15] necesariamente y no reciben lo que ellos
[2:05:19] reciben solamente lo que mensaje ha
[2:05:22] hablado qué tan importante es en el
[2:05:25] fondo de este
[2:05:27] párrafo qué cuidadoso tiene
[2:05:32] que escoger es esencial que todo
[2:05:36] ministro sea fielmente
[2:05:39] enseñado en cada carrera y en cada
[2:05:42] ocupación usted tiene
[2:05:45] una usted que sea un un un
[2:05:50] carpintero cu años de de aprendizaje
[2:05:54] usted está en un aprendizaje Usted tiene
[2:05:56] que saber qué hacer en el
[2:05:59] trabajo en la carrera que usted sea
[2:06:01] usted tiene que ser enseñado fielmente
[2:06:03] porque usted no llega a la cima y usted
[2:06:07] comienza a alambrar alambres y el rojo
[2:06:11] va con el negro y el negro con el blanco
[2:06:14] usted si usted alambra usted alambra
[2:06:17] todo en los alambres incorrectamente
[2:06:20] usted va a quemar los
[2:06:25] circuitos es por eso que es tan
[2:06:28] importante la escritura dice que
[2:06:31] sean fielmente enseñados y que de esa
[2:06:34] manera enseñemos a
[2:06:38] otros el hermano branan no estaba
[2:06:41] buscando multitudes grandes él estaba
[2:06:44] buscando hombres que fuesen enseñados
[2:06:47] fielmente su
[2:06:51] fue un jalón de separación El tercer
[2:06:54] jalón muchas
[2:06:56] veces la gente se apoyó en el primero y
[2:06:59] segundo jalón porque allí esos jalones
[2:07:02] no son muy
[2:07:06] ofensivos él Revela la palabra y vino a
[2:07:10] ser ofensivo pero la única cosa ofensiva
[2:07:13] que él hizo en un en un mensaje de
[2:07:16] resurrección solamente fue para abrir
[2:07:19] los ojos aquellos dos que iban a Emaús
[2:07:24] Dios es un separador no un mezclador es
[2:07:29] eso
[2:07:30] correcto Dios es un separador y en la
[2:07:33] guianza del Espíritu Santo El hermano
[2:07:36] branan habla como aquel hombre que salió
[2:07:39] de la la escuela y que se mezclaba en la
[2:07:42] sociedad Dios no es un mezclador Dios es
[2:07:44] un separador Dios quiere algo usted lo
[2:07:47] Escoge a él porque muchas veces
[2:07:51] Dios no Escoge a hombres así él quiere
[2:07:55] gente separadas por el espíritu santo Lo
[2:07:58] que el mundo quiere hoy en este día lo
[2:08:00] que el mundo quiere hoy en este día
[2:08:02] gente que se mezca gente que caminen y
[2:08:05] se tengan compañerismo con el mundo y
[2:08:08] teng compañerismo con la gente y recibir
[2:08:10] muchos miembros y tener una una
[2:08:12] organización social Pero Dios dijo por
[2:08:15] medio del Espíritu Santo dijo separad a
[2:08:18] Pablo Dios quiere separadores la vienta
[2:08:20] de las
[2:08:22] 1964 Dios es un separador no un
[2:08:25] mezclador la iglesia quiere un un buen
[2:08:27] mezclador hoy en este día que alguien
[2:08:29] que se vista con con
[2:08:32] pantalones y que vaya y se comporte así
[2:08:35] allá fuera Dios quiere
[2:08:41] separar nosotros no estamos aquí para
[2:08:43] excitarlas para ponerlos todos
[2:08:46] excitados sol simplemente estamos aquí
[2:08:49] para apuntarlos a ustedes de regreso a
[2:08:52] lo que él dijo a mí me a mí me gusta
[2:08:56] excitarme y brincar y saltar pero esto
[2:08:58] no termina la obra El terminar la
[2:09:01] palabra es captar la revelación y seguir
[2:09:04] adelante muchas veces va a ser duro
[2:09:05] áspero en San Juan 6 le dijeron a qué
[2:09:11] Qué haremos para hacer las obras de dios
[2:09:14] Jesús le respondió les dijo esta es la
[2:09:16] obra de Dios que crean en aquel que él
[2:09:19] envió que él ha enviado
[2:09:23] usted no se le requiere que manufacture
[2:09:25] algo entiendan esto si usted es si usted
[2:09:28] es oveja usted no manufactura la la lana

[2:09:43] decirle a una oveja tú tienes que
[2:09:46] manufacturar manufacturar la ese es el
[2:09:48] problema con los pentecostales hoy en
[2:09:49] este día es lo que el el problema con
[2:09:51] los cristianos hoy en este día ellos
[2:09:54] tratan de manufacturar algo una oveja no
[2:09:57] se le pide que manufacture ella la
[2:10:00] produce y son los frutos de ella Gloria
