[28:24] bless you brother uh let's uh take our
[28:27] bibl in the Book of Luke chapter
[28:32] 6 get you off your feet very quickly
[28:36] verse
[28:41] one and it came to pass on the second
[28:44] Sabbath after the first that he went
[28:48] through the corn of fields and his
[28:50] disciples plucked the ears of corn and
[28:53] did itat rubbing them in their hands may
[28:56] God bless the reading of his word you
[28:57] may be
[28:59] seated uh once again I greet you all in
[29:03] the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[29:05] Christ uh thanking our precious Pastor
[29:09] for the
[29:10] opportunity uh for letting us back again
[29:14] here as uh the Lord uh I was uh telling
[29:18] him one time we were standing out there
[29:20] that the Lord has uh LED things in uh
[29:23] such a
[29:25] Simplicity that uh as uh uh
[29:28] professionally what I do had to this
[29:31] period of time is a a little bit of h a
[29:34] little bit of hard time to be focused on
[29:36] two things as to try to multitask is not
[29:40] always a good thing to do and uh I sat
[29:44] one day
[29:45] and uh was talking to the Lord not
[29:48] necessarily praying but I was just
[29:50] sitting and working and say Lord with
[29:53] all this I don't want to just walk up
[29:56] here just for uh knowledge and and show
[30:00] and stuff and I just stopped there and
[30:03] uh the next day brother Ron was in my
[30:05] text like hey I'm wanting you to do this
[30:08] I said well he knows uh how to lead
[30:10] things amen uh by his grace and uhu and
[30:14] during all this period I believe I was
[30:16] in
[30:17] Mexico um in January right after that
[30:20] that's where the busy season started and
[30:23] the Lord just gave me all the time for
[30:25] work and just as soon as uh finished uh
[30:30] with the busy season here I am on the
[30:33] pulpit and uh the next three weeks I'm
[30:35] out again so pray for me uh as the Lord
[30:40] uh is leading all these things in uh
[30:43] such a Simplicity that uh he shows that
[30:46] it's not knowledge it's not the desire
[30:49] to be standing and preaching and and
[30:52] being on the field but by his grace is
[30:55] uh making the work uh go smoothly and so
[30:58] that we not stressed and stuff uh by
[31:01] God's grace I'll try to finish up with
[31:04] what we had started uh it is a little
[31:07] bit long but I'll just just try to
[31:10] squeeze things because as time goes
[31:13] living time in between it becomes a
[31:15] little bit too watered so you'll bear
[31:18] with my language tonight if it's a
[31:20] little too compressed by God's grace you
[31:23] take the time to uh research those
[31:25] things because you know we've been uh
[31:28] looking into Luke 20 uh2 but tonight I'm
[31:32] uh shifting quickly into Luke 6 um to
[31:36] try to uh just uh um close things up a
[31:40] little bit but God's grace we'll uh be
[31:43] speaking on the super race so we started
[31:45] with uh the end times and the super race
[31:48] but uh this will be part seven and we'll
[31:51] just try to do uh this tonight the super
[31:55] race and to try to close it up
[31:58] as uh we just read here in the book uh
[32:03] Luke 6
[32:05] verse1 uh Luke has been a very very
[32:09] interesting a very big blessing for me
[32:12] for um maybe six seven years now that it
[32:16] keeps coming up we started uh it looked
[32:20] three and now look six and Luke 22 when
[32:24] all we are acquainted with Luke 177 uh
[32:28] but uh there's more as uh you go deep
[32:31] into it because himself in Luke 1 he
[32:34] says uh dear beloved uh Theophilus uh
[32:38] have taken the time to search these
[32:40] things from the very beginning so that
[32:43] we know with certainty we have uh uh the
[32:46] the understanding the perfect
[32:48] understanding this these things that are
[32:50] commonly believed among us but um we
[32:55] don't read the Bible like the rest of uh
[32:59] the people out there because we are a
[33:01] privileged people um as uh the Lord has
[33:05] given us the eyes to see the things that
[33:09] were hidden from all these times here uh
[33:13] we see that in
[33:14] Luke 6 verse1 and it came to pass on the
[33:18] second Sabbath after the first we can
[33:20] quickly see two
[33:22] sabbaths uh the first Sabbath a Sabbath
[33:25] is uh seven days um seven days and B
[33:29] Bram will get to it it shows us a little
[33:31] bit more how to look at the Sabbath and
[33:34] how to understand this that was the
[33:36] first Sabbath and on the second Sabbath
[33:39] certain event took place because on the
[33:41] first Sabbath also events uh took place
[33:44] so when we read about the Sabbath we
[33:47] don't read it historically we don't read
[33:49] it as uh uh just any scholar that goes
[33:53] and reads about the Sabbath but it says
[33:56] it came to pass on the second Sabbath
[33:58] after the first that certain things
[34:01] event took place that he went through
[34:03] the corn of field and his disciples
[34:06] plucked the ears of corn and he did itat
[34:09] rubbing them with their hands we see
[34:11] that the same Jesus uh that was on the
[34:14] first
[34:15] Sabbath came into the second Sabbath and
[34:19] on the second Sabbath he had his
[34:22] disciples and the disciples that we saw
[34:24] in uh Luke 22 that were s and whining
[34:29] about like who should be the greatest
[34:31] who should be counted the greatest he
[34:33] started dealing with them on a different
[34:35] level he took them from the
[34:36] justification level now bringing them
[34:39] into sanctification but then the
[34:41] sanctification level he was dealing with
[34:43] the disciples the rest of the Pharisees
[34:47] verse two and certain of the S Pharisees
[34:50] said unto them why do do ye that which
[34:53] is not lawful to do on the on the
[34:56] Sabbath days because they were not
[34:59] acquainted with that level of the
[35:01] ministry they started saying well we as
[35:03] the Methodist we do this here when we
[35:06] have to eat the corn we have to wash our
[35:08] hands and all these ways of looking at
[35:11] things but Jesus was moving the ministry
[35:13] a little higher so he can enable the
[35:16] disciples into a whole another dimension
[35:19] that's where now the super race idea
[35:22] comes into view but then in verse 6 and
[35:26] it came to pass also another uh on
[35:29] another Sabbath now this is now the
[35:31] third
[35:32] Sabbath there was the justification
[35:35] level there was the sanctification level
[35:37] but then on the on the uh on on the
[35:41] third Sabbath at the end there he says
[35:44] and the scribes uh verse 7 and the
[35:47] scribes and Pharisees watched him
[35:50] whether he would heal on the Sabbath day
[35:52] they were saying the days of Miracle has
[35:54] passed because they couldn't see God's
[35:57] program as he was coming to pass because
[35:59] they were blinded but Jesus had certain
[36:02] disciples that he was bringing along
[36:04] with because the same Jesus we see in
[36:06] the midst of the seven Church ages is
[36:09] the same one walking along and has is
[36:12] bringing the church along those sabbaths
[36:14] people but then the Pharisees they were
[36:16] caught in the denominational Rivers they
[36:19] couldn't see the moving of the eer of
[36:22] God's program and they were standing
[36:25] there they said well the there of
[36:27] miracle has pass you can't be healing in
[36:29] these days anymore but then Jesus looked
[36:32] at him at them and says well is it good
[36:35] for us to do good in the Sabbath or to
[36:38] do
[36:40] evil because people were coming to the
[36:43] meetings they were seeing the son of man
[36:46] at the end of the third Sabbath which is
[36:48] the pente the Pentecostal Feast feast
[36:51] and they were standing they say well
[36:53] what are you going to do about all these
[36:56] people who have needs yeah they couldn't
[36:59] help because it was not given unto them
[37:02] because all the devil can throw all kind
[37:04] of disease upon God's children but he
[37:07] can't take it away but then God now who
[37:10] is rich in Mercy has to come down
[37:13] himself in order to provide thy healing
[37:15] because I am the Lord that Health thee
[37:18] of all thy diseases so then this Lord
[37:22] now was coming now he says but verse 8
[37:25] but he knew the thoughts we see the
[37:27] first pool there of healing and the
[37:30] second pool of discernment coming into
[37:32] this place Jesus standing there among
[37:34] them at the end of the third Sabbath and
[37:37] Jesus as he was dealing with them he
[37:39] said but he knew the
[37:41] thoughts but then they couldn't
[37:44] understand what kind of Ministry they
[37:46] were dealing with they couldn't see that
[37:49] God was made flesh in De day they
[37:52] couldn't see that the promise of Isaiah
[37:54] was coming to be fulfilled and as now
[37:57] they were sitting and they were looking
[37:59] but they were bound because in the uh
[38:03] book of kings and Chronicles when they
[38:05] were taken out into Babylon they came
[38:08] back into they went into three waves and
[38:10] came back with three waves and they
[38:12] didn't know again all what God has
[38:16] promised for the time people were
[38:18] dealing with all kind of things but then
[38:21] the same Jesus now comes back now is
[38:23] showing the people that at the end of
[38:26] that Sabbath this what I'm going to do
[38:28] and he's performing it that Emmanuel was
[38:31] among them and as Emmanuel was made
[38:34] flesh among them to them he was the next
[38:37] fellow daugh son he was just the next
[38:40] fellow daughter he was just like you
[38:42] know somebody that we know in the church
[38:44] but they didn't see God and morre being
[38:47] made manifest among them because the
[38:50] promise was not given to them but the
[38:52] promise was given to the air sons of
[38:56] Abraham because the seed shall continue
[38:59] on because the devil tried to destroy
[39:02] the seed along the church edges through
[39:05] the Dark Ages but then again under
[39:08] another Sabbath Martin Luther started
[39:10] the journey then Wesley started the
[39:13] journey but then now at the end now of
[39:15] the Pentecostal Feast now there comes
[39:17] now the first frood fruit that has to be
[39:20] waved upon the people but then now this
[39:23] is where now Jesus is showing them that
[39:26] hey look at all this year especially in
[39:28] the message that we have seen this
[39:30] ministry come along and has the ministry
[39:33] come along verse 12 now he says and it
[39:36] came to pass in those days meaning in
[39:38] the days of the third Sabbath it says
[39:41] that in those days it that he went out
[39:44] into a mountain to pray and continued
[39:48] all night in prayer to
[39:51] God because Jesus had dealt with the
[39:56] denominations and showed them the signs
[40:00] that they supposed to receive because
[40:02] they they asked him like you know give
[40:04] us a sign he said in adulterous their
[40:06] generation nothing will be given to them
[40:09] that a sign the the of of Jonas and also
[40:12] in this day we must also receive a sign
[40:16] and the sign that is promised now to the
[40:19] Believers it was a God to be Med flesh
[40:22] fulfilling exactly as it was done in
[40:26] Genesis 19 and has now the word is
[40:29] coming to pass but then the Lord doesn't
[40:31] just go to them as we have seen them in
[40:34] the previous messages that Jesus was
[40:37] came down all uh Elohim came down to
[40:42] make to investigate what was taking
[40:44] place in the land because we have seen
[40:46] Babylon how it came about how Nimrod
[40:49] came into the land how Nimrod had
[40:51] divided the people divided the
[40:53] language uh put all kind of ranks among
[40:56] the people and things but then in this
[40:59] time now Jesus
[41:01] says he went into Prayer by going into
[41:05] prayer it was not a matter of Jesus
[41:07] coming and selecting people by his own
[41:10] desire because the son doeth nothing
[41:12] except he has sin done by the father and
[41:16] also in these last days we have seen
[41:18] also that one had to go into prayer
[41:22] telling his wife that I am tired of
[41:24] seeing all these Visions I am tired of
[41:26] seeing all this year they're calling
[41:28] this that that I'm having bad suppers
[41:31] and I'm I'm having a a weir Spirit upon
[41:35] me let me go and pray if I don't come
[41:38] back after a certain number of days
[41:40] replace somebody after me amen and when
[41:44] he went there then we can see that Jesus
[41:47] by going into prayer all night he must
[41:50] have received a visitation by receiving
[41:54] that visitation that we see that Jesus
[41:56] comes down that when it was day he
[41:59] called unto him his disciples because he
[42:02] was popular in those days he was called
[42:05] unto his disciples and and of them he
[42:09] chose 12 of whom he named
[42:14] Apostles many people were
[42:17] gathered after the three sabbaths has
[42:20] completed the first pool had come and
[42:23] and come and been manifested the second
[42:25] one has come and manifest
[42:27] but then on this level of the ministry
[42:30] now it's no more a public
[42:34] event it's not more given to everybody
[42:38] but
[42:38] now the son of man goes now to call by
[42:43] name certain
[42:47] people and these certain people now is
[42:50] the super race we see it as brother Bram
[42:52] lays it out that these people that he's
[42:55] calling is after God's
[42:59] Vision because Jesus just did the
[43:02] preacher just didn't come and chose like
[43:04] you know Sister sit there brother sit
[43:06] there and all these things here no but
[43:08] then the Lord had to make them available
[43:11] for them to be present at that meeting
[43:14] that Jesus was called to call them by
[43:17] [Music]
[43:19] name and it says a Simon he called whom
[43:23] he also named Peter and and Andrew his
[43:26] brother James and John philli and B
[43:29] Matthew and Thomas uh James the the son
[43:32] of alus and and Simon called called
[43:37] zelotes and Judah the brother of J of
[43:40] James and Judah is scariot which also
[43:43] was the
[43:45] traitor all these names but also in
[43:50] among them also one was a
[43:53] traitor according to God's Vision yes
[43:56] sir
[43:58] Jesus God himself gives the vision to
[44:02] call people by name to give them the
[44:06] position to give them the part of this
[44:09] ministry to be partaker to eat the Mana
[44:13] because from the very
[44:14] beginning all the disciples were able to
[44:18] fit in with a justification brother
[44:21] Jesus loves you everybody
[44:23] amen sister put on a long dress on the
[44:26] second saath
[44:29] amen they even come to the ministry
[44:32] remember brother Bram said that the
[44:34] devil can bring somebody among you give
[44:38] him a position all this is it God's
[44:41] Vision yes
[44:44] sir but then remember now the Lord is
[44:47] looking for a super race and the super
[44:51] race all of us have come through the
[44:54] same Journey as we saw that hey the uh
[44:57] the seed of nimrod they all look just
[45:00] like us but they have a powerful thought
[45:03] in mind when Judah was coming into the
[45:06] temple chosen by God was coming with a
[45:09] powerful thought in mind because the
[45:12] same agenda that Nim had from the very
[45:14] beginning by destroying all the seeds of
[45:17] God along the journey all the prophets
[45:20] he was also going to do it with
[45:23] Jesus right but then all of this is Al
[45:27] part of God's Vision that's why we are
[45:30] always delivered unto
[45:33] death you go the criticize you they
[45:36] don't look at you as important and all
[45:38] this year you look what did I do to them
[45:40] it's part of God's Vision that's
[45:44] right why me why they don't give me this
[45:46] opportunity why should I fight for this
[45:48] and this or that and when you understand
[45:51] God's program quickly now you start
[45:54] seeing it is important for Judah to be
[45:57] right there and it's to Judah that they
[46:01] have given all the money of the
[46:06] world Amen because all these things are
[46:10] given to us for our examples so we know
[46:13] that the situation the condition that
[46:16] the Lord put God put Jesus in the world
[46:21] is also going to apply to all of
[46:24] us why am I picking up all these uh
[46:28] three sabbaths like that Feast of the
[46:30] trumpets uh brother sorry you can uh
[46:33] probably pull up the table to bring this
[46:35] up I didn't send it to you um uh Feast
[46:37] of the trumpet paragraph
[46:39] 228 and and seven Sabbath is the seven
[46:42] Church ages Church ages get it see see
[46:46] now the Jew had been blinded waiting all
[46:49] this time while Pentecostal Pentecostal
[46:51] first fruit had been poured out upon the
[46:53] church historically you can uh follow
[46:56] along so it makes more sense so I don't
[46:58] have to go into too many details and
[47:01] when we uh and and we've come down
[47:03] through the mar age and down through
[47:06] reformers age and now in the calling out
[47:10] three sections Same Spirit like Father
[47:13] Son and Holy Ghost same one see but
[47:16] seven Church ages being seven
[47:19] sabbaths right exactly seven sabbaths
[47:23] from the Pentecostal Jubilee a a
[47:26] Pentecostal Jubilee Feast the waving of
[47:29] the shiv and then the Pentecostal
[47:32] Jubilee and then from the Jubilee to the
[47:35] atonement is seven Sabbath 50 days and
[47:39] at the end of the 50 days the atonement
[47:42] is made you you get it now and this has
[47:46] been a type that the church when he was
[47:50] revealed himself as Son of God has been
[47:54] revealing to the church in the baptism
[47:57] of the Holy Ghost down through the ages
[48:00] in the Pentecostal age just keep getting
[48:03] more and more justification under Luther
[48:06] sanctification under Wesley baptism of
[48:10] the Holy Ghost then we come on now this
[48:15] great being that we've been talking
[48:17] about that he wants to do a certain work
[48:20] in the same message paragraph 99 and the
[48:23] angel or the
[48:25] man
[48:27] why did Sarah say that in her heart yeah
[48:32] at the end of the Pentecostal age after
[48:36] the first fruit has been poured out now
[48:40] we see that the
[48:42] angel he says and the angel oh the men
[48:49] amen the man said to Sarah amen the man
[48:56] was asking why isn't the church
[48:58] believing
[49:00] yeah the church has seen the three
[49:05] sabbaths have seen the
[49:08] justification
[49:10] sanctification and the out pouring of
[49:12] the first fruit but now the angel is
[49:16] standing there looking at the church
[49:19] giving them the sign that they were
[49:21] supposed to receive but the church is
[49:24] there
[49:25] doubting
[49:29] because they are not expecting the angel
[49:33] in their
[49:36] form because we saw it last last service
[49:39] that we spoke about the condescending of
[49:42] the Lord the Lord coming down into
[49:45] Babylon because we saw that coming down
[49:48] is not a movement of up and down but is
[49:51] the god changing
[49:54] forms now the issue now with eror is the
[49:57] fact that he wants to
[50:00] see the angel in the form that he wants
[50:04] to see
[50:05] [Applause]
[50:06] her but God who is rich in Mercy who is
[50:10] a sovereign he said no I want you to
[50:13] know me by my word that's right I want
[50:17] you to know me by my
[50:20] word because if you can't tell no
[50:23] understand who I am the day that I will
[50:26] change the form and you miss me then
[50:30] quickly you fall under the umbrella of
[50:33] nimrod because nimr when he came he
[50:36] divided the people but then now when he
[50:39] comes he say no no no I'll take whatever
[50:42] form I need but I need you to recognize
[50:46] who I
[50:47] am because under that Ministry the
[50:51] revelation of the son of man I'll take
[50:53] whatever shape and form that I need in
[50:55] the form of that light in the form of
[50:58] the angel in the form of the prophet in
[51:01] the form of the brother in the form of
[51:03] the sister but it is still the same God
[51:07] made
[51:09] flesh and as now is being made flesh and
[51:12] being manifested now he said well I need
[51:16] you to be able to understand my program
[51:20] because if you understand my program and
[51:23] the way I behave just like in the book
[51:25] of uh of songs he says like you know my
[51:28] beloved is like unto a unto like a young
[51:31] a heart he's keeping on the
[51:34] mountains today you see him in one form
[51:37] tomorrow is in another form and as he
[51:40] coming down the mountains you see that
[51:43] the word is being revealed as I am
[51:46] growing in the word and as the word is
[51:49] being revealed unto us the closer we are
[51:53] looking more now more clearly
[51:57] because the perfect one has come because
[52:02] after the second Sabbath and and the
[52:04] third Sabbath in those days is the day
[52:08] that he's coming to look for the
[52:10] bride praise the Lord and this bride now
[52:14] must understand how he
[52:17] belovs her beloved her beloved Works how
[52:22] he walks how he talks how he behaves how
[52:26] he changes form and what and when he
[52:29] changes the form what type of work is he
[52:32] going to do in that
[52:34] [Applause]
[52:35] form because William Bram we have seen
[52:38] him along the journey when you you look
[52:41] through the message you see him he says
[52:44] well all the time that that angel has
[52:47] come I've never worshiped him
[52:50] right right he knew the difference but
[52:54] the very minute that angel was on the
[52:57] pulpit without being
[52:59] seen he said I'm waiting for him to take
[53:02] place amen he knows that when the angel
[53:06] appears in a human
[53:07] form he knows that this is not the form
[53:10] to
[53:12] worship and that's the problem now also
[53:14] with those who worship the prophet right
[53:17] yes you have seen great things yes you
[53:20] have seen the discernment but that form
[53:23] is not to be
[53:25] worshiped
[53:30] amen and the angel oh the man why did s
[53:35] say that in her
[53:36] heart in the tent behind him why did did
[53:40] he say did she did she say these things
[53:43] cannot be see a man in human flesh like
[53:48] a prophet and yet it was Elohim
[53:52] Discerning the thought that was in the
[53:55] in Sarah
[53:58] heart amen like a prophet amen yet it is
[54:06] Elohim but then all the
[54:09] Angels even in the Book of Revelation it
[54:12] says John do not worship me I
[54:16] know you have seen great things I know
[54:20] in Revelation one it says I Jesus have
[54:24] sent my angel right to teach these
[54:27] things to the churches but then at the
[54:30] end of all this great revelation of the
[54:32] Mysteries that you John do not worship
[54:36] me do not worship your wife do not
[54:40] worship your
[54:41] pastor yes she is
[54:44] obedient yes while the rest of the world
[54:47] the woman have become old that they have
[54:51] become and now that you have found Grace
[54:53] that God has given you that wife but
[54:55] she's not to be
[54:57] worship yes it is the Lord in human
[55:00] flesh but not to be
[55:01] worshiped because the age we are living
[55:04] in the woman now is now you have to
[55:06] worship me now for you to to marry me go
[55:09] on your knees no
[55:12] amen because when William Bram went to
[55:16] uh went to uh to Rome he wanted to meet
[55:18] the pope I'll give you all the titles
[55:20] you
[55:21] want I'll call you all that you want but
[55:25] to kneel for you
[55:29] no yes you have done great wonders you
[55:31] have built the big churches and the
[55:34] Great Schools and you've helped the
[55:36] world and all this but nevertheless we
[55:38] will not worship you worship is only
[55:41] reserved to our Lord and Savior Jesus
[55:44] Christ and now this Jesus that we have
[55:48] seen along the church edges is the one
[55:51] doing all this wonderful
[55:54] work it's not the man that's right the
[55:58] shape the forms that he taking should
[56:01] not be a stumbling block to us because
[56:04] we know to whom God is very jealous he
[56:08] can share his worship with anybody
[56:11] else when you start taking the worship
[56:13] that belongs to God and you give to the
[56:15] pastor to the minister to your race and
[56:17] to your country to all these things here
[56:20] then the Lord said well I'm going on to
[56:22] destroy
[56:24] it I'm going to destroy it
[56:27] the greatest nation of the world that
[56:29] everybody looks
[56:30] after but then at the end the Lord said
[56:33] like well King of the North come and
[56:35] take this thing out of my my
[56:38] sight that's true Nebuchadnezzar thought
[56:40] he was so he said oh look at the nation
[56:43] that I've built to look at me and all
[56:45] these things it say because you have
[56:47] lifted your heart because you think that
[56:50] you are the most beautiful one because
[56:53] you think you are the strongest one I'm
[56:55] going out to to bring you down right and
[56:59] I oh well all these things are taking
[57:01] place now it comes to the bride to teach
[57:04] them the
[57:05] word to bring the church to its original
[57:09] position and by coming back to that
[57:12] original position the church doesn't
[57:14] just sit there like that no the church
[57:17] is called onto a
[57:19] work because it is a super race and this
[57:23] super race is not called by aen
[57:26] denomination and men's doing and men's
[57:28] knowledge but it is called by God
[57:31] himself under his own program that's why
[57:35] Christ in the true church is the
[57:37] continuation of book of Acts books of
[57:41] Works things that we must do and this
[57:44] super race is called to do those works
[57:47] and as you finding your partner into
[57:50] your ministry now the Lord now is able
[57:53] to use you even more but then I warning
[57:57] don't be lifted
[57:58] up be
[58:00] humble brother say God is looking for a
[58:04] church aen a people that despite the
[58:08] blessing that is going to bless them but
[58:10] they will remain
[58:13] humble and humility is a very difficult
[58:17] thing to find in this last days because
[58:21] they've given you so many rights it is
[58:23] my right to do this it is my right to go
[58:26] to to school it is my right to do this
[58:28] year but that still small voice comes
[58:31] that's not your place this is your place
[58:34] and it is a big
[58:36] debate what should be a man's position
[58:39] how should a man treat his wife
[58:41] according to the right of the woman we
[58:43] are the feminist it is your right yes
[58:46] the disciple also wondered about the
[58:49] same things who should be accounted the
[58:52] greatest among us because the more right
[58:54] we have the more Liberty the stronger we
[58:58] are but in this last days God is now
[59:02] looking for a people under God's Vision
[59:06] Hallelujah because he prayed all night
[59:09] because William Brenham couldn't do it
[59:11] by himself he went to prayer and while
[59:15] he was praying then the angel came down
[59:18] even Jesus there in the garden of Geth
[59:21] and it couldn't help anymore he went
[59:23] into prayer then the angel come
[59:29] for us also in our turn to fulfill our
[59:32] ministry it's not just us going I'm
[59:35] going to do this I'm going to do that I
[59:36] can do this I can do that no right the
[59:40] same angel that we have seen on the
[59:43] first Sabbath the second Sabbath at the
[59:46] end of the third Sabbath and in those
[59:50] days in those
[59:52] days while he has left all the
[59:55] denomination Nations out right now he
[59:58] also wants to deal with those
[1:00:01] people right paragraph 2 210 uh a
[1:00:07] paradox paragraph 210 I said certainly
[1:00:10] Abraham said it it was it was one uh he
[1:00:15] he was the one talked to him he ought to
[1:00:18] know he said he was Elohim see he he
[1:00:22] come down to make an investigation
[1:00:25] listen to this
[1:00:27] has he's now in the investigation
[1:00:30] judgment we saw it last time see who is
[1:00:37] Believers the same
[1:00:40] Angel he wants to see who is
[1:00:45] Believers we come to church long dress
[1:00:48] that's good second Sabbath we believe we
[1:00:51] receive a message yes that's the first
[1:00:53] Sabbath but now he is come down now at
[1:00:57] the end of the third Sabbath now to see
[1:01:00] who is
[1:01:03] Believers and has is coming down he's
[1:01:05] not coming down just by his own ability
[1:01:08] to come down no he came to William Bram
[1:01:12] he said I came down from the presence of
[1:01:15] almighty
[1:01:17] God because this according to Hebrew
[1:01:20] true uh two this ministering Spirit sent
[1:01:24] from the presence of God to the Airs of
[1:01:28] Salvation as you are ministering it's
[1:01:32] according you have to have come from the
[1:01:35] presence of God and if you have not been
[1:01:37] from the presence of God how are you
[1:01:39] going to do it that's where the place of
[1:01:43] Judah comes into play you are in the
[1:01:46] message you know the message you have
[1:01:49] the knowledge you do it according to
[1:01:51] your understanding but you didn't come
[1:01:54] from the presence of God yes and because
[1:01:57] you didn't come from the presence of God
[1:01:59] quickly there you are now under Nimrod
[1:02:05] condition then you start finding out oh
[1:02:07] I like that brother better I like that
[1:02:09] sister better I really don't like to
[1:02:11] take pay uh be with that one because
[1:02:14] that's what Judas did why you why you
[1:02:17] wasting all this money on Jesus this
[1:02:19] money we should have used it for the
[1:02:20] poor but the poor is you have with you
[1:02:22] all the
[1:02:24] time that's what Nimrod Minds is to go
[1:02:28] to conquer and to take all the resources
[1:02:31] by
[1:02:34] flattering that's what Nimrod is doing
[1:02:36] along the along the way a brother that
[1:02:38] loves money more than the word of God a
[1:02:41] sister that is not submissive to the
[1:02:43] word of God and but being submissive to
[1:02:45] the boss at
[1:02:47] work it is the same
[1:02:54] thing see who is Believers we've been
[1:02:58] hollering so much about it just
[1:03:00] investigate see who really is Believers
[1:03:03] see he and he made himself
[1:03:07] manifest he sent the little weat type
[1:03:10] down in there lus 23 like in modern
[1:03:14] message we hear in
[1:03:16] Babylon but watch what he done it didn't
[1:03:20] done there to that church El he gave it
[1:03:23] a chance to yes
[1:03:28] he gives also the church a
[1:03:32] chance you did Lord You've dealt with
[1:03:34] the with uh with with the
[1:03:37] Pharisees you dealt with them you showed
[1:03:39] them all these things here but now what
[1:03:41] about us but also as he came down he
[1:03:46] investigated that's that was uh mainly
[1:03:48] last service that we saw but he also
[1:03:51] gives us a chance see what I mean well
[1:03:54] my God what did he do you know we made
[1:03:58] out of 16 different elements of the
[1:04:00] earth potassium petroleum and Cosmic
[1:04:03] light and what more he just reached over
[1:04:07] and got a handful of atoms and Cosmic
[1:04:10] light and petroleum said few step into
[1:04:13] Gabriel and made one step into it
[1:04:17] himself that's our
[1:04:20] God
[1:04:22] hallelujah while the world is looking
[1:04:24] for it somewhere out there but in
[1:04:27] Simplicity it takes a father here it
[1:04:29] takes a mother there puts them together
[1:04:32] and few there comes the body after a
[1:04:35] number of days the voice comes
[1:04:38] down do not defile yourself right do not
[1:04:42] drink because when you shall grow I
[1:04:44] shall have a work to do with you m Mama
[1:04:47] I'm hearing a voice are you just being
[1:04:49] delusional no I saw the bridge falling
[1:04:53] down yeah yeah amen I saw the bridge
[1:04:57] falling
[1:04:58] down am it didn't require to go to
[1:05:02] church for him to receive the
[1:05:06] vision because his first Vision that he
[1:05:08] has seen he was 18 months
[1:05:11] old because the very first voice that
[1:05:14] you heard you were a little baby you
[1:05:16] didn't know why you you said you had
[1:05:18] seen that dream that you had seen years
[1:05:20] ago you didn't know why you were always
[1:05:23] different from the rest of the crowd
[1:05:25] amen you didn't know why you were always
[1:05:27] attracted to certain things because that
[1:05:30] same Angel of the Lord is the one that
[1:05:33] has been following you on your first
[1:05:35] Sabbath on your second third and all the
[1:05:38] way to the
[1:05:41] end the Lord coming down to do what to
[1:05:45] deal with a super race and that super
[1:05:48] race has to understand that
[1:05:54] to and when he give his message to
[1:05:56] Abraham he vanish and turn right back to
[1:05:59] God again all the atoms and things just
[1:06:02] broke up like a fire breaks up the acid
[1:06:05] and and chemicals and uh in the wood and
[1:06:08] cold or whatever you burning turn back
[1:06:11] to the Unseen I'm so glad my father is
[1:06:15] like that amen because when you see
[1:06:19] these things give to you you know I came
[1:06:22] from eternity and I'm going back to
[1:06:25] eternity again this body of Flesh that I
[1:06:28] am carrying it's veiling the pill of
[1:06:31] fire and this pill of fire one of these
[1:06:33] days according to the promise I'm just
[1:06:36] going to live it out and then
[1:06:39] disappear and when that is given to us
[1:06:42] brother and the Bible says uh uh
[1:06:45] Revelation 5:6 and I beheld in low in
[1:06:49] the midst of the throne and of the
[1:06:51] phobes and in the midst of the helders
[1:06:54] stood the lamb as it was been slain
[1:06:56] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:06:58] are the seven spirit of God sent forth
[1:07:01] into all the Earth and he came and and
[1:07:04] took the book out of the right hand of
[1:07:06] him that sat upon the throne and when he
[1:07:08] had taken the book for the four beasts
[1:07:10] and the um the four and 20 Elders fell
[1:07:13] down fell down before the lamb having
[1:07:16] every one of them Hops and golden veils
[1:07:19] of ERS which are the prey of the Saints
[1:07:22] and the
[1:07:24] Believers and de bride and you and me we
[1:07:31] sng a new song because he has we have
[1:07:35] seen him along our church ages we have
[1:07:39] seen him along our Sabbath and now as it
[1:07:42] comes to the end now of the journey what
[1:07:44] does he do it takes the seals of our
[1:07:46] lives and open it unto us yes what have
[1:07:50] you been what have you been all these
[1:07:52] years what where have I taken you heart
[1:07:55] of because out of the edges comes the
[1:07:58] seals because under the seals is the
[1:08:00] foreshadow of the things that has taken
[1:08:03] place and how it's going to happen
[1:08:05] that's right and once the Brilliance of
[1:08:08] the revelation of the CH seven Church
[1:08:10] ages is given like a Roman Candle you
[1:08:13] see the PDN you see the projection you
[1:08:15] see the issue you know what is going to
[1:08:18] happen amen the lack of humility will
[1:08:21] now tell you how what you have to work
[1:08:24] on right Lord I need thy humility
[1:08:27] because if I'm not humble this is how
[1:08:29] I'm going to end up because the program
[1:08:32] is given unto me because everything is
[1:08:35] revealed and as it is revealed now the
[1:08:38] bride now has to take now the word and
[1:08:40] be able to work within
[1:08:43] it and they sang a new song saying thou
[1:08:46] are worthy to take the book and to open
[1:08:50] the sales thereof right nobody I went to
[1:08:53] to to the psychologist and to the
[1:08:55] psychics and everybody the doctors and
[1:08:58] and nobody was able to explain it to me
[1:09:02] because even Dr Davis who said that you
[1:09:04] know you had a a bad
[1:09:07] supper somebody else said like you know
[1:09:09] oh John by writing the book of uh
[1:09:12] Revelation he he didn't know what he was
[1:09:14] talking about how can somebody write
[1:09:17] things like this how could you be like
[1:09:18] that like the rest of the
[1:09:20] people because the book of Our Lives was
[1:09:24] sealed yes because nobody nobody was
[1:09:28] found worthy to even look at you nobody
[1:09:32] cares about me because you were a seal
[1:09:35] book but then in Revelation 5 when we
[1:09:39] see him like John taking our lives start
[1:09:44] understanding our Strange and
[1:09:46] misunderstood life then now we standing
[1:09:49] now revealed now we start singing a new
[1:09:54] song
[1:09:55] and the new song is not an idea of a man
[1:09:58] like our country our culture my ideas
[1:10:02] your ideas what do you think
[1:10:05] no sir but it is the same Angel taking
[1:10:10] now this super race because the
[1:10:13] supernatural God is coming into natural
[1:10:17] bodies to make them
[1:10:21] Supernatural and as is bringing now this
[1:10:24] super natural God is coming down in the
[1:10:28] form of a human
[1:10:30] flesh and it begins it with the wave
[1:10:33] sheave one first that comes to maturity
[1:10:36] among us correct look what he has become
[1:10:40] look at his life Journey look at his
[1:10:43] life story and you two are coming also
[1:10:45] this
[1:10:47] way he has also shown you how Nimrod has
[1:10:50] come about how he came into the land he
[1:10:54] said like you know show you first in M
[1:10:56] of Jesus but he wasn't as close as we
[1:10:59] would like it to be because he was born
[1:11:02] without sin but he required also one
[1:11:06] Among Us born in sin Shepherd iniquity
[1:11:10] coming into this world speaking lies and
[1:11:12] bring him also to that
[1:11:16] maturity and everything that we have
[1:11:18] seen being done with him we also have
[1:11:21] the promise because when the slaves were
[1:11:24] there the bondage one now had to go up
[1:11:27] the mountain and as he went up the
[1:11:30] mountain then when he start seeing the
[1:11:32] rising of the sun then the rest of them
[1:11:35] know it is our Liberty now it is now our
[1:11:38] Shalom and as we sing Our Shalom now we
[1:11:42] know we are no more Bound by the
[1:11:44] denominational River we know that our
[1:11:46] way out now amen and when he went out he
[1:11:51] didn't just say go back and sit back
[1:11:52] home no because when you receive that
[1:11:56] Ministry when you receive that
[1:11:59] manifestation you can hide it because
[1:12:01] you don't like to candle and you hide it
[1:12:03] under the bed but it has to be put on
[1:12:06] the mountain and you are the Mountain of
[1:12:09] God the great Jerusalem the great Zion
[1:12:14] that has to shine forth the lights all
[1:12:15] over the place each one of us in our
[1:12:19] Ministries at home at school at work in
[1:12:24] our diverse places says this great
[1:12:27] mystery angel of God made manifest in
[1:12:31] you and while is being made manifest for
[1:12:33] you to sit down
[1:12:36] no so the old mindset of nimr is
[1:12:39] something of the past because when Jesus
[1:12:43] was lifted up he lifted up so high that
[1:12:45] he had to look the uh the skies down so
[1:12:48] also you also when you are lifted up out
[1:12:51] of all the cultural things and all these
[1:12:53] things now we are them as
[1:12:57] filthy because what did Paul say he said
[1:13:00] like you know now I look at all this
[1:13:03] account them as
[1:13:05] done all that we thought that we were
[1:13:08] all that we thought that we could have
[1:13:10] been be I am this I am that you look at
[1:13:13] that has
[1:13:14] done because that was the scheme of
[1:13:17] nimrod to try to show you that you are
[1:13:20] something different that's what he went
[1:13:23] to tell Eve that you will become God
[1:13:25] while he was already God that's right
[1:13:28] that's why the angel of the Lord comes
[1:13:30] down to explain to us our Strange and
[1:13:32] misunderstood life in this mystery
[1:13:35] Babylon that we are living
[1:13:37] in and they s a new song saying thou are
[1:13:39] worthy to take the book and to open the
[1:13:42] C thereof thou was slain and has
[1:13:45] redeemed us to God the relationship
[1:13:48] between God and man by that blood out of
[1:13:51] Kindred that Nimrod has set up us as and
[1:13:55] tongues which n did and people which n
[1:13:59] did and Nations as n did
[1:14:03] yes because Nimrod came and said you are
[1:14:07] Americans you are Mexicans you are
[1:14:09] congales you are Africans and you are
[1:14:12] and all these things that we have seen
[1:14:14] sure but now when the book is open when
[1:14:17] it is really open not just preaching it
[1:14:20] like oh we are we are we are
[1:14:23] no when you are truly open the book is
[1:14:26] truly open now you said Lord you have
[1:14:30] redeemed
[1:14:31] us you have redeemed us I used to look
[1:14:35] at myself with complex I look look at to
[1:14:38] look at myself as something big and all
[1:14:40] these things here the the Prophet come
[1:14:42] say he said that body of yours it's just
[1:14:45] few
[1:14:46] cents that body of yours that you try
[1:14:49] like you know to expose with short
[1:14:51] skirts and trying to seduce men and try
[1:14:54] all these things here said like it's few
[1:14:57] cents and the day they lay down there in
[1:15:00] the coffin nobody all the all the all
[1:15:03] the requests that you were getting you
[1:15:05] not getting them
[1:15:07] anymore all these things that we see in
[1:15:11] the world in Africa in in Asia
[1:15:15] anti-Semitism and colors and all this at
[1:15:18] the end of The Journey brother bam says
[1:15:21] the time that death is about at your
[1:15:23] door all that will become D to you he
[1:15:27] said that he will knock that out of your
[1:15:31] mind but but but you see you see those
[1:15:34] who are called to be under God's Vision
[1:15:38] like Judas that Jesus called by name but
[1:15:42] the Love of Money the love of power the
[1:15:46] desire for being something better
[1:15:48] something
[1:15:50] great he still held onto
[1:15:53] it like like like Cain God tells him do
[1:15:58] like your brother look at that brother
[1:16:01] over there look at that sister over
[1:16:03] there God gives you examples we are are
[1:16:06] surrounded by a cloud of witnesses
[1:16:09] people who fight this battle day and
[1:16:11] night he gives you people around you but
[1:16:14] you're still there like you know just we
[1:16:18] understand we
[1:16:20] understand but then what does he do you
[1:16:23] have redeemed us and verse 10 and he has
[1:16:26] made us unto our God Kings and
[1:16:31] Priests and we shall reign on the earth
[1:16:35] the thing that the disciples were
[1:16:37] looking
[1:16:39] for come on who should be accounted for
[1:16:41] greatest who should Reign who should re
[1:16:43] he said I am showing you a better
[1:16:46] way I am showing you want to rain this
[1:16:49] is the way to follow you need to be a
[1:16:52] king you need to be a priest this is the
[1:16:55] halfway I jesus must dwell in
[1:16:59] you that's the importance of receiving
[1:17:01] the Holy Ghost not just to preach it not
[1:17:05] just to say that I belong to a certain
[1:17:07] church but to really be inside of that
[1:17:11] church to be born into that word yes sir
[1:17:15] and to be born into that word is God in
[1:17:18] human
[1:17:19] flesh because he has seen it you have
[1:17:22] seen it done with the prophet you have
[1:17:24] seen it done with Daddy you have seen it
[1:17:27] done with Mommy and he also wants to do
[1:17:29] it with
[1:17:30] you
[1:17:32] right God wants to do that and he is
[1:17:36] knocking at the door because at the end
[1:17:38] of the third Sabbath he was set outside
[1:17:41] of the church he said behold I
[1:17:45] knock behold I knock and while is
[1:17:49] knocking you may have already probably
[1:17:52] oh brother I've received the prophet
[1:17:54] it's been the message it's been 50 years
[1:17:57] yes but brother Bram also preaches the
[1:17:59] message doors in door right he wants to
[1:18:04] get in there
[1:18:06] too I know really this year nobody knows
[1:18:10] but I need to get in there yeah it's not
[1:18:12] a public show nobody wants to know that
[1:18:16] nobody will come to know that not even
[1:18:19] the preacher will know but him in you he
[1:18:22] knows that you have a door that you have
[1:18:24] to
[1:18:25] open and when he reveals it unto you
[1:18:29] that's where now your true nature will
[1:18:31] come forth that's right oh I've received
[1:18:35] the uh a new spirit you know I get along
[1:18:38] now with everybody but that's not the
[1:18:43] point I will give you a new spirit and
[1:18:47] I'll give you my
[1:18:50] spirit because in the heart there's no
[1:18:52] mental faculty for you to think with but
[1:18:56] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:19:00] and that thinking is not you thinking
[1:19:03] but it is him thinking in
[1:19:06] you and that's what he wants to do and
[1:19:11] by by him coming into you now he makes
[1:19:14] you now Kings and Priests because he
[1:19:17] said behold I am among you I am serving
[1:19:22] you you call me master you call called
[1:19:24] me King but now I want to get into you
[1:19:28] and as I'm getting into you since I am
[1:19:31] the king of kings I will be a king in
[1:19:33] you then you also become the
[1:19:37] king you want to become a priest then
[1:19:40] receive Jesus Christ in your heart let
[1:19:43] him get into every single portion of
[1:19:46] your life let him transform all your
[1:19:50] being let him be The Cloud of Glory not
[1:19:53] in the picture but in the heart let it
[1:19:57] be God made flesh again today let it be
[1:20:01] the one that we are Desiring to see once
[1:20:03] again in this last day let it be the one
[1:20:07] that the world nature is looking to see
[1:20:10] the
[1:20:12] manifestation what is manifestation God
[1:20:14] in you the hope of glory we are looking
[1:20:18] for a glory this is the glory of God we
[1:20:21] are looking for the Temple of Solomon
[1:20:23] this is the Temple of Solomon
[1:20:25] we are looking for what God is doing in
[1:20:27] this last day this is what God is doing
[1:20:29] in this last day God made flesh in human
[1:20:34] flesh in human
[1:20:36] heart you might be the one the craziest
[1:20:39] one we know but when God comes in he
[1:20:43] tames all your hunger he tames all your
[1:20:47] ideas he quitness all the things because
[1:20:51] when he woke up in the boat he said see
[1:20:54] be
[1:20:56] still even if your life is all rugged
[1:20:59] all that you can think of but then when
[1:21:02] he comes in amen everything is at peace
[1:21:05] that's why when he comes down today he
[1:21:07] says Shalom am he say shalom to the
[1:21:10] church Shalom to your bride because you
[1:21:14] have received it and as you are
[1:21:17] receiving it it's not a
[1:21:19] slogan he wants you to be out there amen
[1:21:23] I don't think I'll be to finish the
[1:21:25] message but I think we'll be probably
[1:21:27] close here God himself he's looking to
[1:21:31] come and let bring him in in our lives
[1:21:35] so that as this is working you can look
[1:21:38] and say that it is not I that liveth but
[1:21:41] it is Christ in me every single day amen
