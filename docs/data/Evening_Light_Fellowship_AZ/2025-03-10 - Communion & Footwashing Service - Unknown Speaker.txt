Hallelujah come on you can do better than that come Jesus come turn this around yes hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah God bless you you can be seated for a moment tonight is communion and foot washing we're going to listen to the last sermon brother Brandon preached communion and uh it's the reminds me of the last supper with the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread it was the last time that he was with the 12 to together was the last time that he actually preached a sermon with him until he was betrayed brother Brandon preaches communion and goes off of the scene but he told us that the very next thing that we're going to do when we get to heaven said we're going to take communion amen hallelujah amen for even Jesus said I will not drink of the vine until that day come praise the Lord oh I I love those song specials every one of them was so special amen come Jesus come it's the desire of a heart yes come quickly this might be the day it might be the last hour we don't know with all of the signs and all of the flashing red lights and all of the prophecies being fulfilled all around us how much longer do we have I don't know but I know this that we'll be keeping on until he comes amen I would like us to stand and sing only believe I've got the brothers to go ahead for those of you that have perhaps uh your your tablet or your iPad or your cell phone and you have the table there on it and you want to follow along the rest of you will be doing it up here on the [Music] overhead but what was the real reason why God sent Malachi 4 he says God has sent me to pre preached to you a sermon and he gave me two signs to get your attention it's not the signs that cause you to believe but it was the word it was the voice behind the sign no man ever spake like this [Music] man and he says every time you sing this song let your mind go back and think and be grateful that God has allowed you and given you eyes to see and ears to hear those things that were prophesied in this end time thank you Lord so let's take a moment and let's just thank God and let's sing only believe yes only be all be all things are possible only believe only [Music] be only be [Music] all things are possible only believe God bless you you can be seated for a moment Brethren are you ready with the tap all right God bless you as we listen to God's servant Prophet brother brandom now if we would say the communion should just be taken the word I don't believe anyone has a right to take the Lord's Supper until he's taken the the word of the Lord into his heart see because I'm going I'll read something for you in a few moments and you'll see now notice then why then would we we would on the same basis we could absolutely justify the Salvation Army they do not believe in any form of water baptism that we don't need need it now if we don't need water baptism why are we baptized so well water can't save you the blood saves you I'll agree with that amen that's right the blood saves you not the water but we must take the water as an outward emotion that an inward work of Grace has been done so must we own communion when we have taken the Lord our sacrifice into us as a matter of spiritual birth into us and his body body we live by him by the word we also should symbolize it because it's a commandment repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins Paul said I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night which is betrayed took bread and break it and gave it to the disciples and and said Take and Eat This do uh in rembrance of me for as often as you take this bread you show forth his death till he comes now we found out that in that they had people who come and this precious brother very dear brother he came and he said I never I never did take it brother Braham I don't understand what it is I've been taught the other side I said but remember we will admit that St Paul set it in order in the early Christian Church they went from church from house to house broke the bread singles to the heart and so forth now I said he did put it in the church Galatians 1:8 he said if an angel from heaven comes and says anything else let it be a cursed see amen the same one had him to be rebap tized again from the uh baptism of John to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you see there are three things that we must three things that we must do assembl Lord's Supper feet washing water baptism see there's he said well the now the uh Salvation Army takes it from the point the dying Thief when he died he wasn't baptized yet Jesus said he'd be in heaven that's exactly the truth that's exactly but you see he he he only recognized Jesus right there in an hour he was dying see that's the only that's the only opportunity he had he he's a thief he's a away he's out and he as soon as he seen that life he recognized it Lord remember me and Jesus that was true but to you and I who know that we should B be baptized and refuse to do it then that'll be between you and God Amen same thing in communion now when we take this communion it isn't just the things say have come up here and go to eat some bread and I believe I'm a Christian but if you notice the Bible said he that eateth and drinketh unworthily shall be guilty of the blood and the body of the Lord you've got to live a life that that before the people that and before God and the people that shows that you are that you are sincere uh just a moment longer now in the Old Testament when the sacrifice was uh made um a statue or an ordinance and so is water baptism an ordinance so is feet woring an ordinance amen so is the Lord's Supper an ordinance amen blessed is he who does all of his ordinance keeps all of his statutes all of his Commandments that he might have a right to enter into the tree of life now notice listen this now that in that first when it was first an ordinance of God to bring a sacrifice to the church and uh to the temple and the Altar and offer your gift and uh for your sins the sacrifice of a lamb I can just imagine seeing some Jewish brother coming down the road knowing that he was guilty and he goes to the altar or brings his fat Ox a block or whatever he had or Ram lamb something brought it down the road just as sincere as he could come he walked up there keeping God's ordinance just as sincerely as he could then he laid his hands up on it confessing his sins the priest placing this his sins upon the lamb and the Lamb's throat was cut and uh and then died for him as he laid there the little lamb kicking and bleeding his hands being full of blood and flying all over him the little lamb blatant and dying he would realize that he had sinned and something had to die in his place therefore he was offering this Lamb's death for his death see the lamb died in his place then a man done it with sincerity with deepness of his heart finally over and over it went again over and over it kept going until finally it become a tradition the Commandment of God became a tradition to the people and then here he come down well let's see this is so and so day maybe I'll better go down yeah I better offer Bullock he went out well Lord here's my Bullock see there's no sincerity in it there's no understanding to it now we don't want to take communion like that that's the same thing has become to the Lord's table Isaiah uh 35 no I beg your pardon Isaiah 6 let me take that back I I I believe it's Isaiah 28 is where we find this I'm pretty sure that's the right chapter he said precept must be upon precept and line upon line upon line here a little there a little hold Fai to that what's good for stammer lips other tongues will I speak to this people and this is the rest he said all the tables of the Lord has become full of vomits who can I teach Doctrine who can I make to understand see I think that was right scripture Isaiah 20 who can I make understand Doctrine see the tables now we find out today that this great thing that we're fixing to do tonight in commemoration of his death and his body that we believe that we eat daily or just got through eating as our brother preached to us taking the word of God we believe it with all of our heart we sit manifested we see it given to us we see it Vindicated we feel it in our lives and we must come to this with a deep conscience of what we're doing not just because it's an order you go into church and many times they get out an old soy cracker or some kind of a something break it up in light bread or something and and break it up and people who smoke drink everything else because they're a member of the church they come and take the Lord's Supper well that's filthiness before God even the sacrifice that your holy days and your sacrifice become a Sten him un no yet he ordained them to make that sacrifice but the way they treated it it become a Sten stink in his nose his nostrils the very sacrifice that he ordained that's the way we take the word of God too many Christians today so-call does that we stand up here and teach this word and say Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever and teach the things that he promised us that he would honor and say all was for something else our Sodom worships if become a stink in his nose he will not receive it by no means that's Reason by our traditional habits you don't take the Lord's Supper by tradition you take it because it's the love of God in your heart and keeping the Commandments of God see that's what you take it for so if you don't take it in sincerity just it's a tradition well our church observes Comm communion once every Sunday or once every month or twice the year and you go up say well it's my time take the communion why it's a stink to God see that's just a [Music] tradition even like anything else you you've got to be sincere God wants the depths of your heart you remember the very God that brought you here on Earth is the one you're serving you're doing this because he said so because because it's his order then we want to come up with deepness sincerity knowing that by God's grace that we have been saved and we we love him and we feel his presence and we we sit uh change our lives our our whole being is changed we we we're different people we don't live like we used to we don't think like we used to like in the book here and a spot there was talk about the the two books being W The Book of Life The First Book of Life coming up was when you were born that was your natural bird but then one time way back down in there there was a little grain of life as I was explained to some of the young sisters at the house this afternoon see there's a little grain of life in there that you'd wonder where did it come from what what these strange things I saying is taken for myself like it's going to say William Brandon well 40 years ago go the William Brandon this is the same one tonight somebody back there say William BR he was a rank Rascal because I was born of Charles and Ella brand in that nature I was a sinner I came to the world of liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there too was another nature present predestinated is in there God in this same body two Natures in there well I only cater to one is it grow a good as the baby that ey first thing you know become a liar become everything else that's a sinner because I raised up that way but down in there was a little speck of Life all the time I used to remember as a little boy I hope I'm not holding you too long but going uh sitting out in the on on the creek Bank i' sit there and look around at night time pop and Mom they're gone on out to their rest and them days they were Sinners there's no Christianity in our homes at all and all my drinking and parties and carrying on it made me sick I'd take my my Lantern and my dog and go up the woods to stay all night in the winter time on Hunt till the party was over maybe daylight in the morning come home wouldn't be over I've late on time top of a shed and sleep waiting for daylight to break then i' think of uh how that times then being out there in the summertime get my sticks and putle down for a little wind break or if it rain leave there and have a pole sticking in a water fishing my old crew dog laying there I'd say look at here you know last winter I camped right here one night I build a fire right here when I was waiting for my old dog here to to treat and uh I had a fire here it was froze 5 in deep in the ground that little fire where did you come from where did you come from Who come out here and planted you and what hot house did they bring you out of or what about where didd you come from see that little flower said well it was frozen everything and I build a fire on top here besides the freezing element there was a heat element L here on the big old W I burn here and yet here you are you're alive where'd you come from what was it there was another William Brown he a little spot of eternal life down there from the the the jeans of God the word of God that was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things it was working now look up the trees I think Le I've seen you fall off last year and why you back there again where did you come from what brought you here see it was that eternal life working in the body now then one day as I walked on that voice talking don't never smoke drink so forth the young Fells I got older see there was something moving but yet all that once I looked up I said I'm not the son of Charles and El Brandon there's something call like my little Eagle I'm not a chicken Hallelujah there's something up y somewhere GL oh great Jehovah whoever you are open up I want to come home there's something in me calling then I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured up on it then it begin toow now that old life was forgiven put in the sea of God's forgetfulness to Never Be Remembered against me no more now we stand Justified as though we never had sin in the presence of God then when we come to the Lord's table we must come in reverence love and respect of look where we would have been if it hadn't been for him look where it would been therefore Paul I think in s it orfor when you come together to eat hay one for the other that is other words just wait a few minutes pray check yourself out and if you know a brother's in there just about to do something that's wrong or something uh you pray for him too see carry one the other wait just a minute pray there's any feelings between you or something don't don't do don't do it go make that right first see go straighten that up first because we want to come here just as pure as we can be in our thoughts of one another and to God and to each other and then we come in Fellowship around the table of the Lord see and we do this because that we are giving thanks to him and among one another eating the bread between each other drinking the wine between each other as his blood and his flesh except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you see you see that's what the Bible says except you do it there's no life you see you are then more or less shown you are ashamed to identify yourself as a Christian because of the life that you live and then this is really The Showdown then if you don't do it you have no life if you do do it unworthily you're guilty of the body of the Lord same thing in water baptism if we say we believe on Jesus Christ he saved us from sin and we're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ while we bring we bring disgrace to him we do the things that's wrong and we we have to pay for that and another thing when we do that we are trying to prep confess one thing and do another that's the trouble of us today what I think I'm saying us me and the church that the Lord God has let me speak to in these last hours that we believe we're in the closing time we believe that God has given us a message it's been ordained of God it's been proven of God it's been short of God now we must come to him with reverence with love and with with purity of heart and mind and soul you know the hour should arise when when right among us there be the holy spirit will speak out like it did in Anon and S amen see that hour is arriving see and we are now you just remember that see that God is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now we can receive the message as saying if I was a young man hunting for a wife and I could find a wife I said she's just perfect she's a Christian she's a lady she's all this I Got Confidence no matter how much confidence how much I think she's nice I've got to receive her she's got to receive me see upon these vows what's the same thing we find in the message we see it's right we see God vindicates it's right it's perfectly right year after year year after year continues right continues right everything it says happen just exactly the way he said now we know it's right but see don't do it from an inter lecture standpoint if you do you got a second-handed religion we don't want a second-handed religion something that somebody else has experienced and we are living off of of their testimony as I believe it was Jesus said to Pilot uh uh something a word I was thinking he said there just a few moments ago uh who told you that or was it revealed to you how did you know these things in other words I don't know what the word is now it's been a long time since read but how did you how did you know this what how who reveal this to you about him being the Son of God who revealed you did some man tell you that or as Jesus said is it my Father in Heaven which has revealed it to you see how did you learn it a second hand or is it a perfect Revelation from God is this communion just something I go up for an order say well the rest of them take yes I will too it's a revelation am that I am part of him and I'm part of you I love you and I love him and we're taking this together as a symbol of our love to God and our love and fellowship to one another now I want to read some from the scripture and then I guess we whichever way brother Perry desires today I wish you'd read it with me if you got your Bible First Corinthians the U the 11 chapter and begin with the 23rd verse and then also at our Tabernacle we've always observe this and feet washing always because they go hand in hand together I believe the brother announced it Wednesday night because of the crowds and don't have enough to uh room to get the people in for feet washing we go obser observe this Wednesday night now 23rd verse of the 11th chapter of First Corinthians listen at Paul now now remember keep this in mind Galatians 1: 18 if we are an angel from heaven preaches any other gospel unto you then this gospel that he had preached let him be cursed for I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he gave thanks he break it said Take and Eat This is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me now let me stop right here to say but taking the body of the Lord Jesus Christ in this communion does not mean that that communion is the literal Body of Christ that's Catholic I do not believe that that's right I believe it's only an ordinance that God made with us that's right see it isn't an actual body it's not it's really a little piece of kosher bread that's right it's just an ordinance neither do I believe that the baptism of Jesus Christ in the name of Jesus Christ and water does forgive your sins I do not believe it I be you could be baptized all day long now I know that there's perhaps people sitting here who come from Apostolic church I mean or the United Pentecostal Church which they teach that but you see I I do not believe that the water forgives sins or if it was then Jesus died in vain amen see I believe it it's only an ordinance of God see to show that you have been forgiven but to be baptized for regeneration no I I I don't believe I don't believe that water forgive sins NE I believe that this bread and and wine has anything to do with you only keeping an ordinance that God has ordained for us to do see that's try to be water baptism is the same thing I believe it's compelling to us to do it that he had done it all for our example and he done this for our example and he washed feet for our example now after the same manner also 25th verse after the same manner also he took the cup and when he accept saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me far as off remember now far as off as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh forth the Lord's death till he comes how long until he come amen wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord let me stop just a minute the reason he said this you notice in another verse here another chapter that he said I understand when you when you come together you're eating even getting drunk at the Lord's table they misunderstood it you see they just glutted in see just like people are doing today just live any kind of life and take it see he said you got homes to eat in see but this is an ordinance that we should keep seeing now but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body what are you you're a Christian amen you live before everybody as a Christian and if you take that and don't live as a Christian you're not Discerning the Lord's body you're putting a stum and block in somebody else's way see as they see you trying to do that and they're not living what you're supposed to live see you're not Discerning the Lord's body now watch what what the curse of it is for this CA many are weak and sickly among you and many are asleep the right translation of that word brother per is dead that's right see many of De for if we for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged that's right we judge ourselves we won't be judged but when we are judged we're chastened out the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world see not any attached to the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for the other see and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest I will set in order when I come see now in other words don't just come to take it as a as I said a while ago about what the Jews their sacrifice they it was wonderful it's given by God but it got to a place where they didn't do it in sincerity and in reverence and in order then it become just a it become a a stench in his nose now the same thing is by are coming to take the Lord's Supper amen that we must come knowing what we are doing just like when you go into the water to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you know what you're doing you're putting on to the church what God has put in you Christ when we take this it shows to the church that I believe every word of God I believe that he is the bread of life that comfor godone Out of Heaven I believe every word that he says is the truth and I live by to the best of my knowledge God being my judge therefore before my brothers before my sisters I I do not swear I do not curse I do not do these things because I love the Lord and the Lord knows that bears me record therefore before you I take the par of his body to know that I'm not condemned with the world see there you are then it's a blessing and remember I could give many testimonies on this where I tuck that and explained it in a sick room that's right and seen him heal that's right remember when Israel taken the type of this they journeyed 40 years in the wilderness and their clothes never even wore out and they come out without one feeble among one among them with two million people as a type of this or what would the antitype do if the body of a sacrificial animal did that for them what would the body of Jesus Christ Emmanuel do for us let's us being rever when we come let us be just as Reverend as we know how to come amen you know he was talking about reverence and sincerity and I want to take a moment to speak to all of you that during the time of our uh foot washing it's just become a little bit where we're talking too much can we go into it in reverence and sincerity amen amen I I think you you lose a a a great blessing when you just go to chatting and talking about things you know there's many times when I walk around I'm hugging a Brother's neck and I'm praying for different ones different ones said brother Ron pray for me and I'm here praying and the brother's just three four feet away or talking and there's nothing wrong with that I just think we want to give this time reverence and sincerity and just keep it down and you know I I don't mean that you can't say anything you know but uh let's just be reverent and sincere so if the Brethren will come now if they would we're going to go ahead and take communion so if you Brethren come forward they brother Michel said brother Ron you don't need to wear a pair of gloves he said everybody watches you and you scratch your face go in your ear or something like that you got your glove on so I just believe that God will keep us I've always had a wonderful time of communion and I certainly want to say to all of you that I feel honored to be a pastor of such a people like yourselves oh I I I just want to say that I just believe we're some of the best amen I can't let me just boast on you a little bit I do I've been around quite a bit and I've been here and there oh we're not the shoust and we're not the best singers and this and that and uh but you know what the sincerity of the people here at our church many people come and say and ministers they even come here and say brother Ron wow it's so easy to preach to your people because they pull they desire to hear the word of God and I just want to say how proud I am of each and every one of you and having been your pastor for all these years Earth and I realize that God will hold me responsible I've got to preach it to you straight not to try to just soft soap it or however they say to cut the corners but preach it straight amen and uh so I just wanted to take a few moments there now brother Brenham went ahead and had read the the scriptures there and so I don't feel that I need to do that well I'm sorry I feel I do need to do that because it's us it's here right now is that okay with you for I have this is 1 Corinthians 11:23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he Breo it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself self so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body and for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep if we should judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come would you hold this for me just hold it right here let's bow our heads as we take this bread now heavenly father I take my hands and I break this bread father this do we in remembrance of you that your body was broken for us and by your stripes and your bruises were we set free from all of the condemnation and sin in our lives than we thank you Father for your body we ask now father that many would receive healings and great touches and Revelations father would you come to them Lord even as they partake bless this bread I pray in jesus' name heavenly father I lay my hands upon these cups they are cups of wine it's not grape juice it's wine it has life is a type of the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed for us at Calvary I pray Heavenly Father everyone that partakes tonight of this communion father May may it be a great blessing many May there be healings testimonies of people being touched Revelation coming to them father I pray that you will bless each and every one as we partake of this and we wait here for just a moment in Jesus name we pray amen let's just take a moment bow your heads it says just take a moment remember him amen so let a man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup if I would the Brethren now go ahead and dismiss as they do and you can uh be directed by them now to [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen John chapter 13 verses 1- 17 now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas his scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father was given all things into has given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and he GED himself after that he bouth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith to him Lord does thou wash my feet [Music] and Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou has no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only also my hands and my head and Jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean ever witht and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and with sat down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and he say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done unto you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not great greater than his Lord neither is he that sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are
