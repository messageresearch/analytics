[2:51] Lord here on this earth
[2:56] and let it glorify
[3:00] all that you are worth.

[3:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're nothing without him.
[4:00] Hallelujah.
[4:02] &gt;&gt; Before we take the knees before the
[4:03] Lord, let's sing. Lord, you're
[4:04] beautiful.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:07] Oh Lord,
[4:10] you're beautiful.
[4:14] [Music]
[4:17] Your face
[4:20] is all
[4:22] I see.
[4:27] And when
[4:29] your eyes
[4:31] are on this child,
[4:36] your grace
[4:38] abounds
[4:40] in me. Let's sing that again. Just raise
[4:43] your hand. Number five.
[4:45] Oh Lord,
[4:47] you're beautiful.
[4:52] Thank you, Lord.
[4:54] Your face
[4:56] is all
[4:58] I see.
[5:01] [Music]
[5:03] And when
[5:05] your eyes
[5:08] are only
[5:10] child,
[5:12] Lord, your grace
[5:15] abounds
[5:17] in me. One more time.
[5:20] Oh my Lord,
[5:23] you're beautiful.
[5:29] It's your face.
[5:32] It's all I see.
[5:39] And when
[5:41] your eyes
[5:44] are on this shine,
[5:48] your grace
[5:51] abounding.
[5:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Ezra Paige will get ready to
[6:00] take the needs before the Lord. Got
[6:02] quite a few prayer requests tonight.
[6:04] Just pray as we take them before the
[6:06] Lord tonight. Amen.
[6:09] We have a prayer request here. Please
[6:11] remember sis Sister Sharon Johnson and
[6:14] her family. Her mother, Sister Emily,
[6:16] passed away this morning. So, please
[6:18] keep the family in prayer that Johnson
[6:20] family. Pray the Lord would be with
[6:21] them. We have a prayer request for
[6:25] Sister Malik. She's in the emergency
[6:27] room taking tests.
[6:30] She has headache and nausea. So, I pray
[6:32] the Lord would help the doctors find out
[6:35] what is wrong with Sister Malik. Amen.
[6:38] Please keep my coworker in your prayers.
[6:40] Her name is Jen. She needs a touch in
[6:42] her body as she's going through cancer
[6:45] in her body. Lord bless sister Monica.
[6:48] Amen.
[6:50] Please pray for Johnny Green II. He
[6:53] recently, after many months of anguish,
[6:55] was able to get his daughter here from a
[6:58] third world country to give her a better
[6:59] life. She was prayed for on Sunday. He
[7:03] lives in Mayor and went to pick her up
[7:05] from the school. The police had taken
[7:07] her and he is in desperation as any
[7:10] father would be. Please pray that the
[7:13] Lord would come on the scene for them.
[7:15] That's from brother Amos. Amen.
[7:18] And then brother Greg Yarrell. He's also
[7:20] home at sick. Pray the Lord would touch
[7:23] him as well. Amen. We have one praise
[7:26] report. This is from brother Boaz Page.
[7:29] I shot a buck last weekend and wasn't
[7:31] able to find it. We prayed the Lord
[7:33] would put him in our path and he did the
[7:35] very next day. We're thankful that the
[7:37] Lord remembers the little things. Amen.
[7:40] He's mindful even of the little things.
[7:42] If you have a need, pray just raise your
[7:44] hands as brother Ed would take the knees
[7:45] before the Lord.
[7:52] [Music]
[7:55] &gt;&gt; Let's just pray. Lord Jesus, Father,
[7:59] Lord, we're humbled in your presence
[8:01] once again, Father, to fill the
[8:03] anointing of the hour, Father, that

[8:07] expectations as believers of this
[8:09] message, Lord, that we are standing in
[8:12] yourstead this evening, Father, bringing

[8:25] God. agree with sister Malik. Lord,
[8:27] whatever the infirmity in her body,
[8:29] Lord, we just ask that you would go by
[8:32] the Holy Spirit and touch her in the
[8:33] hospital even now.
[8:35] &gt;&gt; Father, we just remember the one up up
[8:37] in Dewey, Lord, that you'd minister to
[8:39] Amos' friend, oh God. So many needs in
[8:42] the body, oh God. And thank you for the
[8:45] unspoken prayers that were answered in
[8:47] the hearts of the believers. Father, we
[8:50] know that you're Jehovah Gyra. You're
[8:52] Jehovah Rafa. You're the meter, the meet
[8:54] every need, Lord, that's in the body
[8:57] here tonight, oh God.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; And we just ask, Lord, as the ministry
[9:00] goes forth this evening from this
[9:02] pulpit, Lord, that you would discern
[9:04] hearts. You would deliver the captive,
[9:06] oh God. We thank you that you're Jesus
[9:08] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[9:10] forever.

[18:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; I tell you, it's it's like uh when Jesus
[18:27] told him, "Why don't you go also?"
[18:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[18:30] &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Where could we go?"
[18:32] &gt;&gt; He was convinced. Huh? Listen, once
[18:34] you've seen the truth,
[18:37] &gt;&gt; then everything else
[18:38] &gt;&gt; is on the background.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all this evening. I
[18:42] greet you in the lovely name of Jesus
[18:43] Christ. Brother Steven McNeely is going
[18:46] to be ministering tonight, but we have a
[18:48] visitor here among us. Some of you uh
[18:51] may not have met him before, but our
[18:54] brother George Smith. Brother George,
[18:56] come on up here, my friend. Uh he just
[18:58] was down in Tucson and had his 80th
[19:01] birthday. He's looking pretty good.
[19:03] Yeah, look at him, Manny.
[19:06] [Applause]
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Well, it's good to be here. And um I
[19:15] didn't come to speak. I would have tried
[19:18] to wear a tie if I was, but um yeah, I
[19:22] was out in Arizona here these last few
[19:24] days. And you know, this year August has
[19:28] five Sundays, so I've had five birthday
[19:30] cakes this year.
[19:33] I came all the way from North Carolina
[19:34] out here to see you all.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; But you know, these songs that we sing
[19:39] are real.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; We're not just going through the
[19:42] motions.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; If you're going through the motions, you
[19:45] might want to go to the other church cuz
[19:46] it's going to get tough here.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; Uh, a long time ago in 1964,
[19:54] Brother Brandham said, "If things go on
[19:55] the way they are now," I don't know what
[19:57] he was focused on, but something. He
[19:59] said in 50 years it'll be total
[20:01] insanity.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; 2014
[20:07] closed the circle. So we've been 11
[20:09] years in total insanity.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; And you better be sure you know what you
[20:14] believe.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; Because there's a lot of stuff going
[20:17] around.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandon brought us back to
[20:20] the open book.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; We preach from his absolute
[20:24] &gt;&gt; and God answers prayer.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:27] Now in the Bible, Paul had a lot of
[20:29] problems in his time. All this was just
[20:31] starting out. But God inspired him, gave
[20:34] him the true revelation, and that was
[20:36] the benchmark for all the church ages.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; Everybody agree to that?
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; Everybody read the church age book.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; We have a few more if you don't have
[20:45] one. But he said, "If I come back next
[20:48] week or Silas or Ron Peterson or George
[20:52] Smith or William Brandon and says
[20:54] anything different what I've already
[20:56] given you, it's going to the hot place."
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; So just watch out
[21:01] &gt;&gt; because there's a lot of foolishness
[21:03] going around in the name of Malachi 4.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; Not just here in America, but
[21:08] everywhere. That's true.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; But I will come back soon
[21:13] because it's been five years since I was
[21:15] here.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; A lot of you don't know who I am. But uh
[21:19] I promise to come back and um uh be with
[21:23] brother Ron and we'll bring something
[21:25] substantial.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a pleasure to have brother
[21:36] George here. He was saying, "Brother
[21:37] Ron, um, one of the older sermons that
[21:40] Brother Brennan preached on, uh, the
[21:42] great harlot,
[21:44] uh, it was a condensed sermon and one of
[21:47] the ones that was put on the vinyl
[21:50] records in which, uh, brother George
[21:53] gave me a stack of those years ago. And
[21:55] over the years now, I've given them out
[21:56] to ministers from around the world, and
[21:59] I think I might have one or two at home
[22:01] left over." But long story short, he he
[22:04] said, "I listened to it and it was so
[22:06] good that he's just recently uh
[22:09] translated it and printed it into
[22:11] Spanish." So he said before he leaves uh
[22:14] this evening, he'll give us a few copies
[22:16] so our Spanish-sp speakaking people uh
[22:18] believers here uh make sure that you get
[22:21] a a fresh copy of that. I'm sure you
[22:23] will enjoy it. Amen. Let's uh just
[22:26] continue on another song or two. Uh God
[22:29] bless you, Brother Austin. Amen. Let's
[22:32] all stand as we change the order of
[22:33] service. Sing your great name.
[22:39] Oh, the lost are saved
[22:45] and find their way
[22:50] at the sound
[22:52] [Music]
[22:54] of your great name.
[22:58] and all condemn
[23:03] feel no shame
[23:08] at the sound
[23:11] of your great name.
[23:16] In every fear,
[23:20] it has no place.

[23:36] Oh,

[23:52] Jesus.
[23:56] For worthy is the lamb that was slain.
[24:04] He's the son of God and man. You are
[24:09] highly lifted up
[24:13] and all the world will praise your great

[24:37] of your rain? Amen. Who's hungry? hungry

[25:35] Jesus.
[25:38] Oh, worthy is the lamb that was slain
[25:45] for us.
[25:47] You're the son of God and
[25:51] you are high.

[26:01] name.

[28:02] hearts Lord We give it all to thee for
[28:05] thou alone art able to meet all of our
[28:08] needs.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, we commit

[28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Isn't the
[28:16] Lord good?
[28:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, musicians. God bless you. God
[28:21] bless you, brother Austin. Such a
[28:23] wonderful atmosphere and we certainly
[28:25] appreciate uh the gift making way for
[28:28] itself with our brother Austin. Huh. We
[28:31] greet you all in the name of Jesus
[28:32] Christ. It's good to be gathered
[28:34] together. If you have your Bibles, turn
[28:36] with me to the book of Colossians,
[28:38] chapter 3,
[28:41] and we'll read verses 12- 15.
[28:52] Hallelujah.
[28:54] Colossians chapter 3 and verse 12 says,
[28:58] "Put on therefore as the elect of God,
[29:02] holy and beloved, bowels of mercy." So
[29:06] now he's he's not talking to the world.
[29:08] He's not he he's not talking to uh if
[29:11] you want to say foolish virgin or
[29:14] anything like that. No, he's talking to
[29:16] the elected.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; So now the elect when you hear your
[29:20] name, you ought to listen.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. because he's going
[29:23] to tell you something right now.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; He's going to tell you, "Put on
[29:27] therefore as the elect of God, holy and
[29:29] beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness,
[29:33] humbleness of mind, meekness,
[29:37] longsuffering,
[29:38] forbearing one another, and forgiving
[29:41] one another.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; If any man have a quarrel against any,
[29:46] even as Christ forgave you, so also do
[29:49] ye."
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And above all these things, put on
[29:53] charity, which is the bound of
[29:55] perfectness, the bond of perfectness.
[29:57] And let the peace of God rule in your
[29:59] hearts to the which also you're called
[30:02] in one body, and be ye thankful.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated this evening.
[30:14] I would like to title my sermon this
[30:16] evening an attitude of gratitude.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; An attitude of gratitude.
[30:24] So we see in our opening scripture that
[30:27] the Bible that God has certain
[30:30] expectations for us um that he expects
[30:35] us in or how to live our lives and how
[30:39] to conduct ourselves and so on and so
[30:42] forth. And um we see here that that the
[30:47] things that we that we just read as a as
[30:50] a carnal man um we are unable to do
[30:54] those things as a as a as a man in in
[30:58] humanity and raised in in in this in
[31:01] this end time that we're living in. We
[31:03] realize that forgiving one another and
[31:06] having a quarrel against this person and
[31:08] and and longsuffering and kindness and
[31:11] meekness, it's it it's kind of uh the
[31:14] opposite to how we are as human beings.
[31:18] But God puts it in his word because he's
[31:20] not just talking to humanity, but he's
[31:23] talking to the elect of God. And so if
[31:26] he's talking to the elect of God, we
[31:28] understand that it would take a a
[31:31] supernatural life, a supernatural
[31:34] experience from a supernatural God in
[31:38] order to produce this life that the
[31:40] Bible expects us to produce.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Without a born again experience with
[31:45] God, without a change of heart and a
[31:47] change of mind, without a change of
[31:49] direction in our lives, uh uh guess
[31:52] what? um it it's going to be impossible
[31:55] for us to fulfill the word of God.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; So, we can say, "Well, I've been raised
[32:00] in church and I go to church and and and
[32:03] so on and so forth, but without a real
[32:05] change of heart and trying to be in a
[32:09] message church and trying to live the
[32:11] letter of the law, you're not going to
[32:13] be happy."
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Trying to live the letter of the law
[32:16] without a a love experience with Jesus
[32:20] Christ, guess what? You're never going
[32:21] to be happy in church. You're never
[32:23] going to be happy at home. Why? Because
[32:25] it's law.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; But we don't want to live our lives
[32:29] according to the law. One person reads
[32:32] the same scripture, he sees law. Another
[32:34] one reads the same scripture, they see
[32:37] love.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; And so it all depends what's in the
[32:40] heart of the person is what they're
[32:42] going to see.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says we don't see with
[32:46] our natural eyes, but we see from our
[32:49] heart. We understand from our heart.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; And so if our heart is in the wrong kind
[32:57] of condition,
[32:58] &gt;&gt; if our heart is not softened by the
[33:01] presence of God and our heart has been
[33:03] become hardened because of this this
[33:06] this age that we're living in, guess
[33:08] what? That's all we're going to see
[33:10] through our carnal eyes.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; If our hearts are hardened, our spirit
[33:15] is going to be hardened. If our spirit
[33:16] is hardened, our mind is going to be
[33:18] hardened. If our mind is hardened, our
[33:20] eyes are going to be hardened. And all
[33:22] we're going to see is the negativity in
[33:24] this world. I don't want to see the
[33:26] negativity. I want to see the
[33:28] positivity.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; We can look at the world and we can say
[33:32] this world is is is is a fulfillment of
[33:36] the book of Timothy where it says that
[33:38] people will be heady and high-minded and
[33:40] and lovers of pleasure more than lovers
[33:42] of God. And we could look at it and see
[33:44] it and we can dwell upon those things.
[33:46] But we could also look at the scripture
[33:48] and say this day the bride is coming
[33:51] into her full position and with her
[33:54] position she is given authority with the
[33:57] word of God. So we can look at the
[33:59] negativity in the world but we could
[34:01] also look at what we are fulfilling in
[34:04] this day and in in this hour as the
[34:08] elected of God.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:12] Somebody's got to fulfill this. But
[34:14] somebody's got to fulfill this.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; The Bible talks about a rapture.
[34:19] Somebody's got to fulfill the prophecy
[34:21] of a changing of body, of not seeing, of
[34:24] death. And
[34:27] &gt;&gt; and caught up.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's why it's so important
[34:32] for us to be caught up right now,
[34:35] &gt;&gt; to be caught up in the message, to be
[34:37] caught up with a a relationship with
[34:40] Jesus Christ. Now is not the time for us
[34:42] to get lukewarm.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Now is not the time for us to be
[34:47] wandering about in the wilderness, but
[34:49] now is the time for us to to be standing
[34:52] upon a a a sure foundation, a solid
[34:56] rock. Hey.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; But we see that people are uh getting
[35:04] away from this solid rock.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; You ever you ever uh you ever walk
[35:10] through through um uh a nice a nice a
[35:14] nice area of grass? We don't really have
[35:16] it here. In Ireland, we do. Some of you
[35:19] probably grass. What is grass in
[35:23] Ireland? You know, it rains every day.
[35:26] It's beautiful. It's green. It's
[35:27] fantastic. Except when brother Jonathan
[35:29] goes there. It hardly rained at all. So
[35:32] if y'all want to go when it doesn't
[35:33] rain, go with brother Jonathan to
[35:35] Ireland. But you ever walk through a a a
[35:38] a patch of grass and and and it looks
[35:41] lovely and it looks nice and then all of
[35:43] a sudden it
[35:47] and all of a sudden your feet is soaking
[35:49] wet and you're realizing, hey, grass
[35:53] isn't always greener on the other side
[35:55] here. Everybody, it seems like people
[35:58] are starting to to to get away from the
[36:01] solid rock and a solid foundation
[36:03] because it's almost too simple.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; It's almost, if I may say it like this,
[36:10] too boring.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; My
[36:13] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's boring. And so people are
[36:16] beginning to look around and they're
[36:17] saying, "Well, well, going to church is
[36:20] it's it's it's kind of boring. And so we
[36:22] need a great moving of the spirit and
[36:24] and we need to do this and we need to do
[36:26] that and we need to go over here. We
[36:29] don't need to do anything.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; We just need to stay founded on the
[36:33] solid rock
[36:35] &gt;&gt; because when we go looking at other
[36:36] things and and and and start seeking
[36:39] after other things is when we begin to
[36:41] step off the solid rock foundation of
[36:44] Jesus Christ. And when we do, that's
[36:47] when we get in trouble.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; That's when we get our feet wet. That's
[36:50] when we get bogged down in sin and the
[36:53] marry clay of life. Why? Because we're
[36:56] making choices that's taking us off the
[36:59] firm foundation.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; I want my feet firm.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; I want to be on a rock
[37:07] &gt;&gt; and I want to stand still and know that
[37:10] he is God. Amen.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[37:16] &gt;&gt; we're living in a time where the
[37:18] scripture is being fulfilled and and we
[37:21] and we recognize what a what an hour
[37:25] that we are living in as the bride of
[37:27] Jesus Christ of what God has actually
[37:30] done in this end time through these last
[37:33] 50, 60 years or or more. when brother
[37:36] Brandon was on the scene and and and and
[37:38] and
[37:40] all of a sudden, man, Christianity came
[37:42] to life, didn't it?
[37:43] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, people begin to realize
[37:46] uh I was told from a from a an older
[37:50] brother one time and he said, you know,
[37:52] um he was told this, so this goes way
[37:55] back. He was told, he said, you know, we
[37:58] we didn't even know or believe that God
[38:01] answered prayer still until William
[38:04] Brandham came on the scene.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; And so what was so great about Brother
[38:08] Brandham was his simplicity in faith.
[38:14] And that's what I'm I'm I'm going to get
[38:16] into with an attitude of gratitude is
[38:18] that we're we're going to find out that
[38:21] um having thankfulness and having a
[38:24] heart of gratitude and not only uh uh
[38:27] thinking it in your heart and in your
[38:28] mind, but actually being thankful and
[38:31] saying it and telling people you're
[38:33] thankful and telling God you're thankful
[38:35] in the good times and the bad times
[38:38] actually affects our lives. Amen.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; And so the Bible talks about being
[38:43] unthankful,
[38:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[38:45] &gt;&gt; An unthankful person is a miserable
[38:47] person.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; You could give them whatever they
[38:50] wanted. If they're unthankful and
[38:51] ungrateful, hey, it doesn't matter.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; But we're living in a time where it
[38:57] takes a supernatural experience to live
[39:01] out the supernatural life of God
[39:04] himself. Right.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham calls it, he says it is
[39:11] a supernatural word birth. We are
[39:14] birthed by the word of God.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; We are not birthed by the word of a man.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; We are not birthed by some special
[39:23] sermon that that was preached and
[39:25] perhaps the sermon was helpful to your
[39:28] life. But really what it is in your life
[39:31] and my life, it is the word of God that
[39:34] brings the change. It is the word of God
[39:36] that brings the difference.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; First Peter 1 23 it says, "Being born
[39:42] again, not of corruptible seed, but of
[39:44] incorruptible by the word of God which
[39:49] liveth and abideth forever."
[39:52] &gt;&gt; It is through this new birth. And I'm
[39:55] sorry I didn't give the brothers the
[39:57] scriptures, but uh that's that's my
[40:00] fault. It is through this new birth by
[40:04] the word of God that we as the bride of
[40:07] Jesus Christ, as the elect of Jesus
[40:10] Christ, will be without spot or without
[40:12] wrinkle. That there be a bride who is
[40:15] making herself ready. How is she doing
[40:17] it? By the word of God. She's not doing
[40:20] it by legalism. She's not doing it by
[40:23] the law of the letter. But she's doing
[40:25] it by the the spirit. The revelation
[40:28] that the spirit is giving to her, that's
[40:31] what she's making herself ready by
[40:34] through the word of God.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; God.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; And so as God gives us light, we walk in
[40:41] the light.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, God has we're all at
[40:45] different stages of our journey and some
[40:48] have a greater light than others. But as
[40:51] long as you're walking in the light as
[40:53] what God has given to you, if you
[40:56] continue in the light, God will continue
[40:59] to reveal himself because God is light.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; And by the light of the hour and the
[41:07] word of God that has been revealed to us
[41:10] today, it has brought a life upon the
[41:12] believer that has never been uh uh since
[41:16] the church ages ever began.
[41:19] Because now it is a greater light.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; In Pentecost
[41:26] they were never completely as brother
[41:29] say born again.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; The bornag again experience is a process
[41:37] &gt;&gt; and it is a process that was kept for
[41:39] this end time
[41:42] &gt;&gt; for you and for me.
[41:45] Hallelujah.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the light in this hour is
[41:51] greater than it's ever been.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; So now as we're walking in the light,
[41:58] guess what? Where where um what does the
[42:01] Bible say? Where much is given, much is
[42:03] required.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Where much light is given.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Much light is required to shine back.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:15] So this bride of Jesus Christ, she's
[42:18] making herself ready
[42:20] and she is a people that is walking in
[42:23] humility in the light for this day and
[42:27] it makes us become the word being made
[42:31] flesh amongst many peoples.
[42:35] Hallelujah. You know what's amazing?
[42:38] Whenever we talk about the word being
[42:40] made flesh, uh I believe that we have we
[42:45] have gotten to mis misconceptions
[42:49] of what it actually means for a person
[42:52] to be the word made flesh. The elected
[42:56] the word for this day being made flesh.
[43:00] Would it be as simple as kindness and as
[43:03] longsuffering and as gentleness and the
[43:07] different things that we read? Would
[43:09] would that be too simple for you this
[43:11] evening to say that that is a part of
[43:14] the word being made flesh in the
[43:16] believer's life?
[43:17] A lot of times we get so caught up with
[43:20] the miraculous and we love the
[43:22] miraculous and we want to see the
[43:24] miraculous because we believe in the
[43:26] miraculous. But I believe we leave off
[43:29] the the the simple ways of life when
[43:32] we're always looking for something great
[43:34] when God is revealing himself in
[43:37] simplicity amongst the people. And so
[43:40] much of the time because we're not uh it
[43:43] doesn't happen how we expect it to
[43:45] happen, we miss it.
[43:47] Amen.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; And so so much of the time, maybe I can
[43:52] speak for myself, but you're all humans,
[43:54] so I can speak for you, too. Okay? So
[43:58] much of the time we we look to ourselves
[44:00] and and we look at the negativity in our
[44:02] own lives and we say, "Well, if I was a
[44:05] son of God, I would that yeah, I
[44:07] wouldn't have said that or I wouldn't
[44:09] have done that." And if and if and if
[44:11] and we bombard our own minds with if I
[44:14] was. instead of having an attitude of
[44:17] gratitude and saying, "Father, thank you
[44:19] for who I am as a son or a daughter of
[44:21] God."
[44:23] &gt;&gt; And so, so much of the time we get
[44:25] caught up looking at our our own
[44:27] carnality.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; But understand, you didn't choose you.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[44:35] &gt;&gt; you didn't choose you. God chose you.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And so it's very interesting
[44:43] when you begin to think about God's
[44:46] choosing over man's choosing.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; So if we if it was up to us, we wouldn't
[44:52] choose any of us
[44:53] &gt;&gt; to be sons or daughters of God.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we're so good at seeing our
[44:58] own hindered parts and each other's
[44:59] hindered parts.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; We're very, very good at that. It's hard
[45:03] for us sometimes to see the good in our
[45:05] own life, what God is doing. And so we
[45:09] get so caught up with with the tangle
[45:12] and the and the and the fight and the
[45:14] pressure of our natural man and our
[45:16] spiritual man.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; It all depends on which one you're
[45:20] looking at more.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; And so when you think about the choosing
[45:24] of God, I was thinking about King David.
[45:28] And here King David was and and God had
[45:31] told Samuel, he said, "Go to the house
[45:34] of Jesse. He there's a there's a a man
[45:36] there after he's a man after my own
[45:39] heart. I want you to go anoint him forth
[45:41] oil with oil. He's going to be my future
[45:44] king. He's the one that I'm choosing.
[45:46] The people chose Saul.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; But God had a choosing and it was David.
[45:52] So Samuel, well, praise the Lord. Let's
[45:54] go. And he goes and he goes to the house
[45:56] of Jesse. And sure enough, the oldest
[45:58] one steps up and and and and perhaps
[46:01] he's the biggest and the strongest. He's
[46:03] the firstborn boy, you know, and here he
[46:06] is. And uh, no, it's not him. Well,
[46:09] where's the next one? Come on. And oh,
[46:11] it's not him. And they had go on down
[46:12] the line and and God speaks to Samuel.
[46:16] And he says, God, he says, I don't look
[46:18] on the outward appearance of man.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; But I look upon the heart.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; And so, what's what what really is
[46:27] interesting to me is this.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Jesse didn't tell Samuel, I have another
[46:31] boy in the field. That's right.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Samuel's all.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; You got anyone else?
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Like, is there Do you have any more
[46:40] sons?
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Cuz I I've come to anoint your son. He
[46:44] He He's going to be the future king. And
[46:46] do you have any other? He says, "Well,
[46:49] yeah. I got a kid out in the field here
[46:52] hurting the sheep, taking care of my
[46:53] sheep. Go bring him here." It's it's
[46:56] it's amazing to me that he never thought
[46:59] of David. Yeah.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; But God thought of David.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; And so that's the wrestle that you and I
[47:06] have of have a we got sons of Jesse and
[47:10] we got all this uh within our within our
[47:13] lives as carnal men and we're looking to
[47:15] the outward man. We're looking to the
[47:18] flesh man of his mistakes and all these
[47:20] different things instead of looking to
[47:22] the inward man, the seed of David.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. He's out here. There's no way.
[47:32] Can you imagine his brothers?
[47:35] &gt;&gt; David,
[47:37] little They're going to anoint
[47:40] him. There ain't no way. Sure enough, he
[47:42] comes and he anoints him with oil. And
[47:43] can you imagine,
[47:46] you know, and and every time David
[47:49] presented himself when he came to fight
[47:51] Goliath or whatever, and he was taking
[47:53] the the bread and the wine and and and
[47:56] stuff and and and he says, "I'll go
[47:58] fight this guy. They laughed at him.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; You're a naughty boy.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; You just come to see the battle.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; You're naughty. You're You're silly.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; But God had chosen David.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; The army didn't choose David.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Saul didn't choose David. His daddy
[48:18] didn't choose David. Nobody chose David.
[48:21] Why? Because when God chooses, you
[48:24] normally it's against how we see and how
[48:27] our choosing would be.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; You could look at uh uh Saul of Tarsus
[48:34] here. Judas hung himself and they were
[48:36] like, "Well, we need we need another we
[48:38] need another disciple."
[48:40] &gt;&gt; So, they all get together. Well, we're
[48:42] spiritual men and we can make the right
[48:44] choice. And and they cast lots.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, I believe it was
[48:48] Matias, wasn't it? and he comes along
[48:51] and they and they vote him in and and
[48:52] and and and everything and yeah, we are
[48:55] spiritual men. We are the men of the
[48:57] hour. And brother Brandham says he
[48:58] didn't do anything.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Not a thing.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he was the wrong
[49:02] choice.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; But the right choice was a brother
[49:06] Brandham says a hook-nosed hightempered
[49:09] Jew. Y
[49:11] &gt;&gt; you're going to take a hooknosed
[49:13] hightempered Jew who's persecuting the
[49:16] church and you're going to use him to be
[49:18] the first church age messenger.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; You got to be kidding me. But God's
[49:22] choosing goes far beyond our choosing.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; God chose his seventh day messenger uh
[49:28] uh without education. He came from a
[49:31] family of of drunkards and bootleggers
[49:34] and fighters and killers. But yet when
[49:37] everybody looked at the family, they
[49:39] crossed the street when they saw him.
[49:41] But when God saw him
[49:43] &gt;&gt; before the foundations of the world, he
[49:45] says, "That's him.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; He's the one. He's my messenger. I don't
[49:50] care what other people see. It's going
[49:52] to blind them. And I'm going to open the
[49:54] eyes to the elected." I say, "Father,
[49:57] blind our eyes to our choosing and open
[50:01] our spiritual eyes." Hallelujah. to who
[50:05] we really are.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; That's good, brother.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Because when we realize,
[50:13] &gt;&gt; who we are,
[50:15] &gt;&gt; not according to this earthly
[50:17] tabernacle, but according to our
[50:19] spiritual tabernacle, we realize who we
[50:23] are in the mind of God since the
[50:25] foundations of the world, it'll change
[50:28] our attitudes.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; So you got to know your identity
[50:39] &gt;&gt; and you can only find your identity in
[50:42] Christ.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Even though Eve was a part of Adam
[50:48] and and and but she never knew it and
[50:51] she was taken out of Adam and and and
[50:53] and God separated them and and and and
[50:56] everything and here she was. She had no
[50:58] idea who she was.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; But who did she come to? the male. She
[51:04] came to Adam. She came to the word
[51:09] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Your name, you're gonna
[51:11] you're woman. Why are you woman?"
[51:13] Because you came out of the man.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Where did the woman go for her identity?
[51:18] She went to the word of God.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; That's where we receive our identity
[51:25] &gt;&gt; is in the word of God. So don't get off
[51:28] the solid rock and try to find it
[51:30] anywhere else, but find it in the word.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Thank God
[51:38] &gt;&gt; for predestination.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Thank God for his fornowledge.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Thank God for his election
[51:48] &gt;&gt; towards his elected bride.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Stephen, well that
[51:52] kind of doesn't sound fair." and and you
[51:54] might be right, but the Bible says this,
[51:56] "My sheep,
[51:58] &gt;&gt; they hear my voice and another they will
[52:01] not follow."
[52:02] &gt;&gt; So, we see that there's a a sheep there
[52:04] is a people that will receive his voice,
[52:07] but there's a people that will receive
[52:09] other voices that aren't part of his
[52:12] voice. I said, "Lord, just let me hear
[52:14] your voice."
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:21] Philippians 4 verse 6, be careful for
[52:25] nothing. In other words, don't worry.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about anything, but in
[52:30] everything by prayer and supplication
[52:33] with thanksgiving,
[52:35] &gt;&gt; let your requests be made known unto
[52:37] God.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; In everything by prayer and supplication
[52:42] with thanksgiving.
[52:44] That's good advice.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; So, whatever it is that you're praying
[52:48] to God for, whatever it is that you're
[52:51] coming to God and and you have a
[52:53] request, let your request be made known
[52:57] with a thankful heart.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Colossians 3:15, "And let the peace of
[53:03] God rule in your hearts to the which
[53:06] also you are called in one body, and be
[53:10] ye thankful."
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:13] Colossians 4:E 2.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Continue in prayer and watch in the same
[53:20] with thanksgiving.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Do you think the word of God is trying
[53:26] to get something over?
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; To the elected of God.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; He's trying to tell us, hey, be ye
[53:33] thankful.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Have a thankful heart. Have an attitude
[53:38] of gratitude before God. and and and I'm
[53:41] going to get into it a little bit.
[53:42] Having an attitude of gratitude, it
[53:45] doesn't depend on what's going right and
[53:47] what's going wrong.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; But it says, "Be ye thankful.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Be ye thankful in the good times. Be ye
[53:54] thankful in the bad times. Be ye
[53:55] thankful in the middle of the road. At
[53:58] all times, be ye thankful." Amen.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Throughout the scripture, it's very
[54:07] evident to us that God loves a thankful
[54:10] heart.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Regardless of the circumstances that
[54:14] surround us,
[54:15] &gt;&gt; the scripture doesn't tell us, well, as
[54:17] as as long as things are going right and
[54:20] as long as this is good and as long as
[54:22] that's good in the family and money and
[54:24] job and and and as long as everybody's
[54:26] healthy and praise the Lord, then I'll
[54:28] be super thankful.
[54:30] As long as I get a boyfriend, then I'll
[54:32] be thankful. As long as I get a
[54:34] girlfriend, then I'll be thankful. No,
[54:36] &gt;&gt; we're not to wait until the good happens
[54:38] in our life.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; But we are to be thankful at all stages
[54:43] of our lives.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Being thankful is directly correlated
[54:52] with our attitudes.
[54:54] And our attitude is directly correlated
[54:58] with our faith towards the promises of
[55:01] God. And and our faith will determine
[55:04] whether the promises of God come to pass
[55:06] in our lives.
[55:09] So our
[55:11] being thankful is correlated with with
[55:15] with our attitude and our attitude is
[55:20] correlated with our faith and our faith.
[55:24] It all depends on our faith for the
[55:27] promises of God to come to pass in our
[55:29] lives.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Where does it start with? It starts with
[55:33] being thankful.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Without money or
[55:39] without price, 1959, paragraph 105 for
[55:42] the brothers." Sure, they were thankful.
[55:46] They were grateful. And any man or woman
[55:48] that's born of the spirit of God and
[55:50] receives the Holy Ghost will always be
[55:54] thankful. No matter whatever happens,
[55:57] you'll be grateful.
[56:00] So a person that has received the Holy
[56:03] Ghost, brother Brandham says they will
[56:06] always be thankful
[56:09] no matter what happens.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; No matter what has happened in your
[56:16] past,
[56:17] &gt;&gt; no matter what has happened in your
[56:19] family,
[56:21] &gt;&gt; but a Holy Ghostfilled person will
[56:23] always be thankful.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham associates thankfulness
[56:32] and healing of the body together many
[56:34] many times. The brass serpent 1953
[56:38] paragraph 171. You want to get over the
[56:41] female trouble and the arthritis and and
[56:44] and things like that. Just go on off the
[56:48] platform thanking God for it.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Be thankful. He's done it. Amen.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; It's amazing.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; He didn't pray a long prayer over him.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; He didn't anoint him with oil. No. He
[57:07] said, "All you have to do
[57:09] &gt;&gt; is be thankful.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Walk off the platform and thank God for
[57:14] what he has already done."
[57:18] &gt;&gt; You see, that's where Brother Brandon
[57:19] was wanting us to get to. He says, "The
[57:22] work is already finished.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; It's already done. Healing is already
[57:26] ours. Salvation is for our families. We
[57:29] just have to be thankful.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Thankful before it happens.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Just go ahead and thank God.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; He's not saying thank God for already
[57:44] healing you in this body, but thank God
[57:47] for the work that he's already done that
[57:49] he's already healed you.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Did that make any sense?
[57:53] It may not have happened in the natural
[57:55] body,
[57:56] &gt;&gt; but he's saying be thankful for what God
[57:59] has already done.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; And when we're thankful for what he has
[58:04] already done, God loves a thankful
[58:06] worshipper.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does
[58:09] &gt;&gt; because it is correlated with our
[58:11] attitude. And brother Brandham said
[58:13] this, the right mental attitude towards
[58:16] any promise of God will bring it to
[58:17] pass.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So it's not necessarily
[58:22] mental.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; It's not necessarily well I got to think
[58:26] positive
[58:28] &gt;&gt; and and I got to and I got to think it
[58:30] in my mind. Take the mental out of it.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; The right attitude
[58:35] &gt;&gt; towards any promise of God
[58:37] &gt;&gt; will bring it to pass in our lives. We
[58:39] see the word mental and we think
[58:41] psychology and and we think that
[58:44] psychology. But brother Brandham's not
[58:46] talking or preaching psychology. He's
[58:48] preaching the right attitude because our
[58:52] attitude is correlated with our
[58:53] thankfulness. And when we're thankful
[58:55] and our attitude is good, it'll bring
[58:58] the promises of God to pass in our
[59:01] lives.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Let's read another one. Whatever he says
[59:06] to do, do it. 1953. Oh father, as this
[59:10] poor little old hand lays over here in
[59:13] mine, know that maybe it's stroked back
[59:16] the tears of many crying baby's eyes and
[59:18] rock the cradle. Maybe in a younger day
[59:21] the little baby would get hurt and come.
[59:23] Mother, you'd kiss away the tears and
[59:25] rock them away and it'd be all right.
[59:27] But God, I'll take your hand to wipe the
[59:29] tear tonight to rock away the things.
[59:32] But thou can do it. Lord, I pray that
[59:34] you'll grant it. May she be healed
[59:36] tonight. Now I lay hands upon her in the
[59:38] name in Jesus' name for her healing. God
[59:41] bless you, sister. Go happy and
[59:43] rejoicing. Be thankful to God and you'll
[59:46] get well.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's plain.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; So what brother Brandham is and it and
[59:56] this just runs right along in the
[59:58] scriptures and it runs along brother
[1:00:00] Brandham's ministry. You can you you can
[1:00:02] there's there's hundreds of quotes where
[1:00:04] he would take people he said well just
[1:00:06] go on and be thankful. He said be
[1:00:08] thankful to God and you'll get well.
[1:00:13] I wonder
[1:00:15] is there sickness amongst us because we
[1:00:17] are unthankful.
[1:00:20] how easy it is for us as as mortal
[1:00:25] beings to get hardened and for our
[1:00:28] spirit to get hardened and we become
[1:00:31] unthankful without even realizing it.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; I remember uh I painted brother Ezra's
[1:00:39] dad's house and uh and um who was up
[1:00:44] there? What's his name? Uh brother Bill
[1:00:46] Bezy Painting. Used to be Basy Painting.
[1:00:48] He used to own it. Uh, and so I was
[1:00:51] talking to him anyway and I said, "Man,
[1:00:54] what what's your secret? What was your
[1:00:55] secret?" You know, he sold the business
[1:00:57] and then he started again and he this
[1:00:59] guy was just a business starting
[1:01:00] machine, you know? He's just good at
[1:01:02] making money. And um I tell me your
[1:01:04] secret. I want to know your secret. He
[1:01:07] goes, "You want me to tell you what I
[1:01:08] did, brother Steve?" "Yeah, tell me.
[1:01:10] What Google thing did you use? What
[1:01:12] marketing did you use? You know, I I
[1:01:14] want to know." He says, "For every job
[1:01:16] that I did, I was thankful."
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; I said, "Wow."
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "When I would go to a
[1:01:22] customer's house and I would walk up to
[1:01:24] the door, I say, "Father, thank you so
[1:01:26] much for this opportunity to serve this
[1:01:29] person." And here I am thinking, "Ah,
[1:01:32] it's something great, something
[1:01:35] fantastic, something that you have to
[1:01:37] spend a bunch of money to do.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Be ye thankful."
[1:01:41] He says, "I was thankful and God blessed
[1:01:44] my business."
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; And I kind of realized back then,
[1:01:52] I guess by not being thankful, you're
[1:01:56] being unthankful.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; That's true, brother.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:01] And so by not sharing to the Lord,
[1:02:03] sharing to your mom, sharing to your
[1:02:05] dad, sharing to your spouse, whoever it
[1:02:08] may be, that that that's friends and
[1:02:10] family and loved ones and people that
[1:02:12] you're connected with by not showing
[1:02:14] them that you're thankful for them in
[1:02:16] your life, you're actually showing that
[1:02:19] you're unthankful
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; because you're not showing that you're
[1:02:22] thankful.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; To have an attitude of gratitude towards
[1:02:28] one another.
[1:02:30] towards our spouses, our husbands and
[1:02:33] our wives and our children and and
[1:02:35] whatever it is. Be thankful for the
[1:02:38] people that God has placed in your lives
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; because not showing the thankfulness and
[1:02:45] the gratefulness and and and and and
[1:02:49] those things we are actually being
[1:02:52] unthankful.
[1:02:54] Yeah.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; And a person who is unthankful is
[1:02:58] unhappy. Person who is unthankful is
[1:03:03] they turn into a brat I guess would be a
[1:03:05] good way to put it. There's a scripture
[1:03:08] where it says unthankful and it talks
[1:03:11] about murderers and all these different
[1:03:13] things and at the end it says
[1:03:14] unthankful.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:03:19] I wonder how many of us would put our
[1:03:21] name in that part of the scripture that
[1:03:23] we're fulfilling of murderers and this
[1:03:25] and that and the other, but yet we're
[1:03:27] there at the very end being unthankful.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; It's an amazing thought, isn't it?
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Because by not showing our gratitude to
[1:03:40] one another, we are actually being
[1:03:43] unthankful
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; towards one another.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Who wants to help somebody
[1:03:49] that's unthankful?
[1:03:53] Once, twice, three times.
[1:03:57] Have someone else to help you. Haven't
[1:04:00] said thank you one time. There's been no
[1:04:03] gratitude.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; There's been no I appreciate you. Thank
[1:04:06] you for what you've done for me. I
[1:04:09] really appreciate it. Right.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; You know, if you just be thankful to
[1:04:15] your parents, they'd do a whole lot more
[1:04:17] for you.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Yeah.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amazing. We were camping up in up in
[1:04:26] Flag over the weekend there and um and
[1:04:29] Brother Luke Neil, come over to me. They
[1:04:31] were playing um capture the flag at dark
[1:04:33] time and the kids just loved it. This is
[1:04:35] just so much fun. And he goes, "Man,
[1:04:37] brother Stephen, you know what? three
[1:04:39] out of your four kids came over to me
[1:04:41] and they told me, "Thank you so much." I
[1:04:43] said, "They did? Who was the one who
[1:04:45] didn't?"
[1:04:48] He was bragging on my three kids and I
[1:04:50] was wondering who didn't, you know, and
[1:04:53] and and I was and he said, you know, I
[1:04:56] really appreciated that
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; little little kids came up to me. Thank
[1:05:01] you for playing with us and for doing
[1:05:04] that with us.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Made him feel good. It would make him to
[1:05:07] where if we go next year again, he'll
[1:05:09] want to do it even better. Why? Because
[1:05:11] he realizes, hey, these kids are
[1:05:13] thankful. They enjoy what we're putting
[1:05:15] on for him.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; When was the last time you told your
[1:05:20] pastor, "Thank you.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; When was the last time you sent him a
[1:05:26] text and just saying, "Thank you,
[1:05:28] brother Ron.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; I love you.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; I appreciate you." When was the last
[1:05:33] time you did that?
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, your phone is going to be
[1:05:37] overloaded tomorrow.
[1:05:41] And you know what? He's going to respond
[1:05:42] back. Thumbs up.
[1:05:49] If you know, you know.
[1:05:55] The Queen of Sheba 1960 for your baby.
[1:05:59] Many suffer from the same disease. Do
[1:06:01] you believe its little heart will get
[1:06:03] well and it'll be all right? Do you
[1:06:05] believe, Father God, the baby's too
[1:06:07] little to have faith? May it be well in
[1:06:08] the name of Jesus, in Jesus Christ's
[1:06:11] name. Look at that prayer. So simple.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't doubt the baby will live. Go
[1:06:17] home and be thankful to God. Now,
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was trying to show to
[1:06:25] the people that no matter what lays
[1:06:28] before them, if they would just be
[1:06:29] thankful to God and what he has already
[1:06:32] done at Calvary, that things would begin
[1:06:34] to change. He told us time and time
[1:06:37] again that the work has already been
[1:06:39] finished and that if Jesus was here in a
[1:06:42] body uh like like me with a suit on
[1:06:45] right now, he could do nothing more for
[1:06:47] us because he's already done it all at
[1:06:50] Calvary.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; So that's why he says he's already done
[1:06:54] it. The work is already finished. You
[1:06:57] don't have to worry about it. Just be
[1:07:00] and move on. Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; And if nothing changes, just be thankful
[1:07:05] and move on. And if nothing changes,
[1:07:08] just be thankful and move on. And at
[1:07:11] some point in life, God will bring the
[1:07:14] change. Why? Because God loves a
[1:07:17] thankful worshipper. Because our
[1:07:20] thankfulness is correlated to our
[1:07:22] attitude, which is correlated with our
[1:07:24] faith. And without faith, it is
[1:07:26] impossible to please our Lord.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. True breath.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 6:15. And so after he
[1:07:38] had patiently endured, he obtained the
[1:07:42] promise.
[1:07:44] Before we can have faith to receive
[1:07:46] healing from God, we must first of all
[1:07:49] get rid of all the uncertainty
[1:07:52] concerning the will of God in this
[1:07:55] subject.
[1:07:57] Excuse me. for us as believers to say if
[1:08:01] it be the Lord's will, this will happen.
[1:08:04] And if it'll be the Lord's will, when
[1:08:07] it's written within his word already
[1:08:09] that it is his will. If you say, "Well,
[1:08:11] if it be the Lord's will for this to
[1:08:13] happen, well, it'll happen." It pl it
[1:08:16] plants a little seed of doubt in our
[1:08:19] minds
[1:08:21] because then we think, well, maybe it's
[1:08:23] not the will of God.
[1:08:27] Maybe in order for this to happen of the
[1:08:29] healing of my body or whatever it may
[1:08:31] be, and the longer that it goes by, we
[1:08:34] begin to think in our minds, well,
[1:08:36] perhaps it's not for me and perhaps it's
[1:08:39] not the will of God. And it plants a
[1:08:42] little seed within our heart without us
[1:08:45] even realizing it. Because a lot of
[1:08:48] times we don't want to get so boastful
[1:08:52] and so proud I guess it would it would
[1:08:54] seem like to say father thank you for
[1:08:57] what you've already done.
[1:09:00] But we say well if it be the Lord's will
[1:09:05] I want to tell you in order there's too
[1:09:08] many scriptures and promises within the
[1:09:11] word of God
[1:09:13] that belongs to us for the healing of
[1:09:15] our bodies. and and and I feel I feel
[1:09:18] led to go down this direction of the
[1:09:20] healing of our bodies more than anything
[1:09:23] else for whatever reason. And so
[1:09:27] because we get so doubtful and we say,
[1:09:30] "Well, maybe it's not. Maybe it's not
[1:09:31] for me." But yet the word of God says
[1:09:34] this, it is for you.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Healing is the children's bread.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; And we are children of God.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. by God's election and by his
[1:09:47] fornowledge.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; And so the Bible says if you ask your
[1:09:51] father for h a bread, will he give you a
[1:09:55] stone?
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; No. A loving father would never do that.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; And our heavenly father will never do
[1:10:01] that to us either.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; So let me just refresh what brother
[1:10:05] Brandham said. Just go on and be
[1:10:08] thankful.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:11] Because what happens is when doubt is in
[1:10:14] the presence and it it it with within
[1:10:17] our spirit without us even really
[1:10:20] realizing it, it brings our attitude
[1:10:23] down
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; and it takes away our thankfulness
[1:10:28] because it's opposite. Doubt uh and
[1:10:30] unbelief is opposite to the things of
[1:10:32] God. And so when doubt is present in our
[1:10:35] lives, it's hard for us to see the
[1:10:38] positive because the negative is taking
[1:10:40] over.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; When we see the scriptures, there's a
[1:10:51] few things that we must do. We must take
[1:10:54] the word of God and we must hide it
[1:10:57] within our hearts.
[1:11:00] And we must be as what the Lord told
[1:11:02] Joshua and meditate on these things
[1:11:04] night and day to keep our eyes fixed
[1:11:07] upon the promise that God has given us
[1:11:10] through his word. And when we saturate
[1:11:14] ourselves with the promises that's
[1:11:16] written within this word, we no longer
[1:11:19] are affected by temporal things.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; So it goes back to knowing who you are
[1:11:27] and where you come from. And it's and it
[1:11:29] goes back to the word of God. And it
[1:11:32] comes back to saturating our spirit and
[1:11:35] our mind with the promises of God for
[1:11:38] this hour. Because when we do that, it
[1:11:40] kicks out doubt
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; and it kicks out fear and it kicks out
[1:11:45] the unknown because as believers, we
[1:11:48] have this understanding that all things
[1:11:51] will work together for the good to those
[1:11:54] who love God.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And so when we saturate
[1:11:57] ourselves with the word and with the
[1:12:00] message of the hour and with certain
[1:12:02] quotes and certain scriptures uh uh you
[1:12:06] know based around what it is that you're
[1:12:08] going through when you saturate
[1:12:10] yourselves with the with those things
[1:12:13] the things of the world it kind of takes
[1:12:16] a back step. Yeah,
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; we don't we don't have it on our
[1:12:19] forefront anymore because the Bible is
[1:12:23] in our frontal
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; uh vision now.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; But if we just accept the lie that Satan
[1:12:30] wants to tell us and if we just accept
[1:12:32] everything that's going on in life,
[1:12:34] before we know it, our faith is low
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; because it's what we're feeding on.
[1:12:48] As the musicians come, we'll bring this
[1:12:51] to a close.
[1:12:53] Let me give you a a few scriptures this
[1:12:56] evening
[1:13:00] that it may be deposited into your
[1:13:02] hearts of the will of God concerning
[1:13:05] healing in your lives.
[1:13:08] You know, self-help stuff helps a little
[1:13:11] bit.
[1:13:13] But it doesn't deliver.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; It helps, but it can only take us so
[1:13:20] far.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; We can listen to podcasts and these nah,
[1:13:24] we need to listen to the word of God.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:28] When I was in Canada with brother
[1:13:31] Eugene, we went and we visited this
[1:13:33] brother who has MS and his body just
[1:13:37] absolutely deteriorating and and he was
[1:13:40] having a very hard time, difficult time
[1:13:43] and and so we were there and and we were
[1:13:46] encouraging him and you know uh brother
[1:13:49] Eugene is is a lot of fun to be around
[1:13:51] and um
[1:13:54] so as we were as we were leaving you
[1:13:56] know Um, we had a very nice special time
[1:14:00] and this brother opened up his heart and
[1:14:02] shared with me his testimony and shared
[1:14:05] with me how uh he had a child die and
[1:14:07] and and so on and so forth. And uh came
[1:14:11] into the message about five years ago
[1:14:12] and you see his family just a beautiful
[1:14:14] little family.
[1:14:17] And we had gotten done praying with him
[1:14:20] and he sat back down because he was
[1:14:22] getting tired. And he made a comment. He
[1:14:25] said, "You know, you know, brother,
[1:14:28] I I just try to encourage myself every
[1:14:30] day
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; because he's getting to a place where he
[1:14:34] can't walk and he can't take care of
[1:14:37] himself." And he's a he's a young man.
[1:14:39] He's in his late 40s, early 50s, can't
[1:14:42] take care of himself, can't clean
[1:14:44] himself. And so he say, he said,
[1:14:46] "Brother, I just, you know, some days I
[1:14:49] just sit and I listen to self-help
[1:14:52] things and it encourages me."
[1:14:55] I said, "Brother, do you ever listen to
[1:14:57] Brother Brandham's messages outside of
[1:14:59] church?"
[1:15:01] He says, "No, I don't." I said, "Do you
[1:15:04] have the table app on your phone?" He
[1:15:07] says, "What's the table app?"
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Eugene looks at me.
[1:15:13] I said, "Bro, Eugene, you take over."
[1:15:16] So, we got his phone. We downloaded the
[1:15:18] app on his phone the table. We showed
[1:15:21] him how to search quotes. We showed him
[1:15:23] how to listen to sermons.
[1:15:25] And it was just it was just amazing
[1:15:28] that,
[1:15:29] you know, he, Brother Eugene, told me,
[1:15:31] "Well, Brother Steve, it's amazing you
[1:15:32] caught that." I said, "I I I don't
[1:15:34] know." He goes, "I can't believe that he
[1:15:38] was he was there, been in my church all
[1:15:40] these years, and I just took it for
[1:15:41] granted." Yeah,
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; that he knew the table lap. I just took
[1:15:45] it for granted that he was listening to
[1:15:47] sermons and and stuff, but now I realize
[1:15:50] he's not. And so, Brother Eugene told
[1:15:52] him, he said, "You need to start back in
[1:15:55] the late 50s at the apex of brother
[1:15:58] Brandham's second pull ministry of the
[1:16:00] healing of the body and so forth, and
[1:16:02] you need to you need to surround
[1:16:05] yourself."
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Not with self-help stuff,
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; but by the word of God.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because by doing this, it's going
[1:16:14] to ignite your faith.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Self-help will only take you so far. But
[1:16:19] when faith arises,
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; faith arises with with with muscles in
[1:16:24] its chest, with muscles on its arms.
[1:16:27] When faith arises, Satan trembles.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of us are are are
[1:16:37] getting off of the solid rock. How how
[1:16:40] many of us are are are you know what?
[1:16:42] I'm I'm just kind of bored. It's kind of
[1:16:44] boring. I need I need something better.
[1:16:47] I I need something I need something
[1:16:50] fantastic. I need some kind of feeling.
[1:16:52] I I need something cuz it's boring.
[1:16:56] Church becomes boring when your
[1:16:58] spiritual life is dead.
[1:17:02] It's not because the church is boring
[1:17:04] because there's other people that are
[1:17:06] growing and enjoying it and having a
[1:17:09] good time. But if you find church is
[1:17:12] boring, it's because there's something
[1:17:14] wrong spiritually within you. But you
[1:17:17] don't got to stay that way.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; You can go to your car and pray. On your
[1:17:23] way home, you can pray with your family.
[1:17:25] On your way home, you can tell your wife
[1:17:27] and kids you're thankful for them. And
[1:17:29] before you go to bed at night, lead each
[1:17:31] other in prayer and be thankful for one
[1:17:34] another. And I guarantee you, you'll see
[1:17:36] a change.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; A change will come.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; It'll break the ice.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; It'll take away the stony heart
[1:17:46] by simply being thankful. Amen.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Markapter 9:23 Jesus said unto him, "If
[1:17:56] thou canst believe, all things are
[1:17:58] possible to him that believeth." Where
[1:18:01] does believing starts? It starts with
[1:18:03] being thankful.
[1:18:06] Isaiah 53:5, "But he was wounded for our
[1:18:09] transgressions, bruised for our
[1:18:11] iniquities. Chastisement of our peace
[1:18:13] was upon him. With his stripes we are
[1:18:16] healed."
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Peter 2 24 who his own self bear
[1:18:22] our sins in his own body on the tree
[1:18:24] that we being dead to sins should live
[1:18:27] onto righteousness by whose stripes ye
[1:18:31] were healed.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; It's already done.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Acts 10:38. I got a few more scriptures.
[1:18:42] how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
[1:18:44] the Holy Ghost and with power, who went
[1:18:47] about doing good and healing all that
[1:18:49] were oppressed of the devil. For God was
[1:18:51] with him.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Is healing the children's bread?
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Matthew 8 16 and 17. When the
[1:19:00] evening was come, they brought unto him
[1:19:02] many that were possessed with devils.
[1:19:04] And he cast out the spirits with his
[1:19:07] word and healed all that were sick that
[1:19:11] it might be fulfilled which was spoken
[1:19:12] by Isaiah the prophet saying himself
[1:19:15] took our infirmities
[1:19:17] and bear our sicknesses.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Matthew 10 verse 7 and 8. And as you go
[1:19:23] preach saying the kingdom of heaven is
[1:19:25] at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the
[1:19:28] lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils.
[1:19:32] Freely ye have received, freely give.
[1:19:36] Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ the same
[1:19:39] yesterday
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; and today
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; and forever.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Being thankful
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; is a grateful language to God.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; As an act of worship.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; You want to you want to worship God a
[1:19:58] little bit. You want to you want to get
[1:20:00] out of your comfort zone and and really
[1:20:02] worship him, start by being thankful.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Start by being grateful. No matter where
[1:20:11] we are in this stage of life or what's
[1:20:14] going on in our families cuz guess what?
[1:20:17] We all have something going on,
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; So, we might as well be happy.
[1:20:25] Not happy that it's happening,
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; but thankful to God.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; God, thank you,
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; thank you for what you've already done.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you for what you're doing in my
[1:20:38] life.
[1:20:39] Thank you what you're doing in my
[1:20:41] family's life. Thank you for what you're
[1:20:43] going to do in our lives. Thank you for
[1:20:45] what you're doing in our church. Thank
[1:20:47] you for my wife. Thank you for my kids.
[1:20:49] Thank you. Thank you.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Being thankful to God in a
[1:20:54] time where you should be unthankful is
[1:20:57] an act of worship.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; That is a sweet smelling savor
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; in the nostrils of God.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Your altitude with God will be
[1:21:06] determined upon your attitude of
[1:21:08] gratitude.
[1:21:11] In other words, the relationship that we
[1:21:14] have with God, our altitude, the how
[1:21:17] high that we that we come up hither into
[1:21:19] his presence
[1:21:21] is determined upon how thankful we are.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; It's dependent upon our attitude
[1:21:30] of gratitude.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:36] So let me ask you this evening,
[1:21:39] how has your attitude of gratitude been
[1:21:43] this past week, this past month,
[1:21:45] whatever it may be? How has your
[1:21:47] attitude been towards life,
[1:21:50] towards your spouse, towards family,
[1:21:52] towards kids, towards work,
[1:21:56] but most importantly towards God?
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Have you been letting the things of the
[1:22:01] world affect your walk with God?
[1:22:05] Have you let Leodysia creep into your
[1:22:08] spirit of of of lukewarmness and
[1:22:11] hardness and and and just coming to
[1:22:13] church and it becoming a a a a a
[1:22:16] tradition, it becoming a thing that we
[1:22:18] just do because we're Christians and
[1:22:20] that's what we do. We we go to church on
[1:22:22] a Sunday and we go to church on a
[1:22:24] Wednesday night, but yet we sit in
[1:22:27] church thinking about life and
[1:22:30] everything that's wrong and we become
[1:22:32] unthankful in our spirit. And then all
[1:22:34] of a sudden when God is trying to speak
[1:22:37] to us, we miss it.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Because our attitude isn't right.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Father, let my attitude
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; be right.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:51] We've all been there.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; We've all had it happen to us and it's
[1:22:55] going to happen to us again. But I hope
[1:22:58] that this sermon can play back in your
[1:23:00] mind and say,
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; "Father,
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; thank you.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; For I know that your word says this.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; All things." Somebody say, "All things."
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; All things.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; All things
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; will work together for the good.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; To those who love God. Yes, sir.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; And are called
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; according to his purpose.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; So now we can look at it and say, "Well,
[1:23:27] I'm not enjoying this
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; and my heart is hurting and this and
[1:23:31] that and the other. All of those things
[1:23:33] are true, but Father,
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; thank you."
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Because I know you're doing something
[1:23:39] that I cannot see.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; You're doing something that I don't
[1:23:43] understand perhaps for further down the
[1:23:45] road. So I place my trust in thee, Lord.
[1:23:49] Amen.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; I place my life in your hands.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; I place my life. Where else could I go,
[1:23:56] Lord? Where could we go?
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; For thou alone hast the words of eternal
[1:24:00] life. Here I am, Lord. I place my all
[1:24:04] upon thy altar of sacrifice.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand together. Hallelujah.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:20] [Music]
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Sing I love you Lord.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; I love you Lord.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Lord
[1:24:32] for your mercy never fails me.
[1:24:38] All my days
[1:24:41] I've been heling your hand.
[1:24:47] From the moment that I wake up
[1:24:52] till I lay my hands
[1:24:56] while
[1:24:59] the goodness
[1:25:01] of God.
[1:25:04] Hallelujah.
[1:25:07] All my life you have been faithful.
[1:25:14] [Music]
[1:25:16] And all my life you have been so so
[1:25:22] good.
[1:25:25] And every breath that I am able
[1:25:32] I will see
[1:25:35] for you.
[1:25:38] Yes, Lord,
[1:25:40] I love yours.
[1:25:43] [Music]
[1:25:46] You have led me to the fire
[1:25:52] in your shine.
[1:25:55] You are most like
[1:26:01] you as a father.
[1:26:05] upon you as a friend.
[1:26:10] I am
[1:26:12] in the goodness
[1:26:15] of God.
[1:26:19] Oh yeah. All my life you have been.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my life. And all my life you have
[1:26:32] been so so good.
[1:26:39] Every breath that I ever
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:46] see
[1:26:48] of the goodness
[1:26:50] of God.
[1:26:52] [Music]
[1:26:56] Your goodness is running after.
[1:27:00] Running after me.
[1:27:05] Your goodness is running after.
[1:27:09] Running after me.
[1:27:14] Lay down. I surrender now.
[1:27:18] Give you everything.
[1:27:20] [Music]
[1:27:23] Goodness is running out.
[1:27:27] running after me.
[1:27:30] [Music]
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; All my life you have.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Are you thankful
[1:27:44] my life you have been so so good. Thank
[1:27:50] him for being good.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; And breath
[1:27:55] I am
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; I will sing
[1:28:02] the goodness
[1:28:04] of God.
[1:28:10] [Music]
[1:28:21] very good word tonight
[1:28:26] [Music]
[1:28:28] before I go to bed tonight.
[1:28:32] I want to thank him and I want to start
[1:28:35] right now.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; I do.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; I thank him
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; for salvation.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; I thank him for healing.
[1:28:46] I thank him for God's people for I thank
[1:28:49] him for his choosing.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; You see, there were key phrases of what
[1:28:55] he and it and clicked. It wasn't you.
[1:28:58] You didn't choose yourself. God chose
[1:29:00] you.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Be thankful.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; God lookketh not on the outward man.
[1:29:05] That's what man carnality looks at. But
[1:29:07] God looks at seed.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:11] because every seed will bring forth of
[1:29:13] its own kind. Church is boring to those
[1:29:18] who are unthankful.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that we have a church.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Because there's a lot of places right
[1:29:26] now they have nowhere to gather.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Or they gather like over in Vonawatu.
[1:29:39] some of the outer islands, they had a
[1:29:42] little place where they were gathering
[1:29:44] and other people came and they beat them
[1:29:47] all up because they were gathering just
[1:29:49] in a a little shack.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; So they started gathering under a tree.
[1:29:56] [Music]
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; But you know what? When persecution
[1:30:01] arise on the church, you get better.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:08] I'm not looking for self-help and
[1:30:10] podcasts.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; You want to
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; You want to get more from God, get more
[1:30:17] into the word, sir.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; And get thankful for all things.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Because thank him in the good times and
[1:30:27] thank him in the bad times.
[1:30:30] Not with the outward praising of man,
[1:30:37] but from the meek and gentle nature of
[1:30:40] the heart, being thankful.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Boy, it hit home when you
[1:30:47] thought about, you ever do something for
[1:30:50] somebody that's unthankful?
[1:30:52] Do it again and again. Finally.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; You kidding me?
[1:30:58] And then he said a key to some of you
[1:31:00] young kids. You want more from your
[1:31:02] parents?
[1:31:03] [Music]
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, Dad, thank you.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Thanks for the $10.
[1:31:11] Yeah, I asked for 50, but I got 10.
[1:31:13] Thank you. Thank you. You're the best
[1:31:15] dad. Okay, son. Here's 50, man.
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; It works.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; It works by being thankful.
[1:31:28] And I want to say thank you to every one
[1:31:31] of you.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Because that's why this church is here.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; It's because of you.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; This isn't
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; This isn't man. This is God. He's given
[1:31:44] us a place.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; He's given us ministry.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Stephen.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:52] [Applause]
[1:32:01] Listen, I I like some of those deeper
[1:32:04] things, dimensions and this and that,
[1:32:07] graphs and charts and all this and ooh
[1:32:09] and awe,
[1:32:11] but this is what you'll take home and
[1:32:12] you will think about
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; and you will pray about and you when
[1:32:17] situations arise tomorrow, you'll say,
[1:32:20] "Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to take the negative. I'm
[1:32:24] going to take the positive.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I am so appreciative to God
[1:32:31] for all of his goodness.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; For all things will work together for
[1:32:36] the good. Brother Andy Bernard told me
[1:32:38] one time time he said, "You know what,
[1:32:40] brother?" He said, "All things will work
[1:32:43] together for the good." But didn't say
[1:32:45] everything would be good.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. But God will use the bad
[1:32:50] to produce good.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; So if there's something bad happening
[1:32:54] right now, just say, "Okay,
[1:32:57] there's going to be goodness come out of
[1:32:58] that."
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Because the trying of my faith is more
[1:33:02] precious to me.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Than pure gold. You want more of gold?
[1:33:07] Be thankful.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; And start praising him for the things
[1:33:12] before they happen.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And heavenly father, I thank
[1:33:18] you
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; for come unto the house of God tonight
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; and by the word being preached in
[1:33:25] simplicity. Father,
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; I thank you Lord for you have spoken to
[1:33:32] my heart.
[1:33:34] Let me be more thankful
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; to my family, to my children,
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; to my wife,
[1:33:42] to those within the church, to the
[1:33:45] musicians, the song leaders,
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; to those that
[1:33:51] are streaming the service right now, to
[1:33:53] th the cameramen,
[1:33:55] to the audio department, the ones that
[1:33:59] adjust the volume.
[1:34:03] Thank you, Father,
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; for it's not made of one important
[1:34:09] person or but it's a body that works
[1:34:13] together for the good.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father, for everyone, for
[1:34:18] every part. Thank you,
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; seen and unseen. I thank you for every
[1:34:22] mother and father, every child,
[1:34:25] everyone that calleth this their home
[1:34:28] church. I thank you for each and
[1:34:29] everyone. Father, I pray that you will
[1:34:32] bless us abundantly as we come back to
[1:34:34] church on Sunday. Remember the needs
[1:34:37] among our body.
[1:34:39] Remember Sister Sharon Johnson having
[1:34:43] lost her mother.
[1:34:46] Oh,
[1:34:48] sometimes these things happen, Father,
[1:34:50] and unexpectedly and somebody's taken
[1:34:54] out of our life
[1:34:56] and there's a void.
[1:34:58] But father, you can be a comforter.
[1:35:03] You can come and in the good times and
[1:35:06] in the bad.
[1:35:09] Give us a peace that passes all
[1:35:11] understanding.
[1:35:12] And Father, I pray that each one,
[1:35:16] Father, even that is here tonight will
[1:35:20] be part of that bridal company that'll
[1:35:22] enter in
[1:35:24] and will say unto each one.
[1:35:28] Enter now, my good and faithful servant.
[1:35:32] Enter into the joys of the Lord. And as
[1:35:36] your prophet said, then he will take and
[1:35:40] wipe away every tear.
[1:35:42] And over there there'll be no more
[1:35:44] sorrow.
[1:35:47] There'll be no heartache.
[1:35:49] There'll be no grieving spirits.
[1:35:53] It'll be entering into the joys of the
[1:35:55] Lord. And it has not even entered into
[1:35:58] the mind of man
[1:36:01] what you have prepared for your people.
[1:36:05] I thank you for this word tonight and I
[1:36:07] praise you.
[1:36:10] I give you thanks in Jesus Christ's
[1:36:14] name.
[1:36:16] Amen.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that song. Give thanks with a
[1:36:21] grateful heart. Amen. If we could, you
[1:36:24] get me the key. And brother Austin, if
[1:36:26] you know that. Give thanks with a
[1:36:29] grateful heart. Give thanks
[1:36:34] with a grateful heart. Give thanks
[1:36:40] to the holy one. Give thanks
[1:36:46] because he's given
[1:36:50] Jesus Christ
[1:36:53] his son.
[1:36:57] And now
[1:37:00] let the weak say I am strong.
[1:37:06] Let the poor say I am rich
[1:37:12] because of what the Lord has done
[1:37:19] for us
[1:37:21] now and now.
[1:37:26] Let the weak say I am strong.
[1:37:32] Let the poor say I am rich.
[1:37:38] Because of what the Lord has done
[1:37:45] for us.
[1:37:48] [Music]
[1:37:52] Brother Martin Malumba, would you come
[1:37:55] dismissed now in a word of prayer?
[1:37:59] Amen.
[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:03] I'm happy that I was in church today.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful.

[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; For the goodness of God.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Hearing the word once again puts another
[1:38:14] part to the great puzzle of God. Amen.
[1:38:17] God bless you, Brother Martin. If you
[1:38:19] would dismiss in a word of prayer.
[1:38:22] God bless you.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Shall we pray? Precious father, surely
[1:38:27] Lord, we ought to be grateful Lord for
[1:38:30] every single day,
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; every single step along the way this
[1:38:36] journey that you have granted unto us.
[1:38:39] It can sometimes be tough and
[1:38:43] narrow and blurry, Father. a Lord
[1:38:48] looking to the unseen.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; We are so grateful Lord that we are
[1:38:52] overcomers
[1:38:54] before the journey have ever started.
[1:38:57] Lord is so grateful Lord the
[1:38:59] understanding Lord that the pattern that
[1:39:01] you have given unto us is not to lean
[1:39:04] onto our own understanding
[1:39:07] but to look Lord Father God away unto
[1:39:09] you. Bless father, brother Steven, every
[1:39:13] single sons and daughters of God in
[1:39:16] whatever condition that we may be
[1:39:18] because all work together for the good
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; to them that love you. Thank you Lord.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; And that are called according to their
[1:39:27] purpose. And therefore we say thank you
[1:39:30] father.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Yes

[1:39:33] assurance
[1:39:35] knowing that Lord that we shall be
[1:39:39] there. We shall make it. Therefore we
[1:39:41] say thank you father.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.

[1:39:45] you've uh

[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Yes
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; through thick and thin.
[1:39:52] You said Lord that uh
[1:39:55] our test is uh more precious Lord than
[1:39:58] precious gold. We can have all the
[1:40:01] inheritance of the world. All this shall
[1:40:04] pass away. But Lord are these
[1:40:07] experiences
[1:40:08] that we shall one day sit around the
[1:40:11] throne and talk about these things.
[1:40:13] Therefore we are so grateful father.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Go with us Lord as we're looking forward
[1:40:18] unto Lord the next service. Lord,
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; give us traveling in mercies as we're
