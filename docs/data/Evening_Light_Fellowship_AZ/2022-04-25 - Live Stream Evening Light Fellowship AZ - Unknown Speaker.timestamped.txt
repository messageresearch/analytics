[24:52] heavenly father
[24:55] lord as
[24:56] we are here and gathered together in one
[24:59] place
[25:00] i pray o god let the holy spirit have a
[25:04] harmony
[25:05] that each one would sit here
[25:08] in one accord
[25:10] father we look to you the author and the
[25:12] finisher of our faith
[25:16] we bring our petitions
[25:19] our requests before you
[25:22] i would ask heavenly father
[25:25] that thou would anoint this word
[25:30] let the eyes of our understanding
[25:34] go beyond the human and carnal intellect
[25:36] that might be able to read the words
[25:41] but father as you moved upon men of old
[25:45] and the holy spirit inspired them
[25:49] to pen these words
[25:53] i pray let that same holy spirit now
[25:56] descend upon each one
[26:00] may it feel this house as it did on the
[26:02] day of pentecost
[26:05] and licks of fire fall upon each one

[26:22] musicians
[26:23] amen
[26:25] praise the lord
[26:29] i had a prayer request come in while you
[26:31] all were singing sister
[26:34] franci nordine
[26:36] um sent in a urgent prayer request the
[26:41] doctors are giving her
[26:43] six months to a year to live
[26:46] and uh
[26:49] she's in severe pain she said the pain
[26:52] is intolerable she's going in for
[26:55] some more tests and
[27:04] everything what if
[27:07] what if you were facing that
[27:10] i wonder how sincere your prayer would
[27:12] be
[27:14] when we say let us pray for others
[27:20] should really take it
[27:22] to heart she says brother ron i i am
[27:25] believing
[27:27] what god said through you to me as you
[27:30] prayed over me
[27:32] and we're just believing that god listen
[27:36] even as jonah in the belly of the whale
[27:40] he said if i look at all of this
[27:45] he said these are lying vanities
[27:49] and he says and if i look to them then i
[27:51] forsake my own mercy
[27:54] oh god
[27:56] i pray let's pray right now for sister
[27:58] francie
[28:00] amen heavenly father now in the name of
[28:03] jesus christ
[28:05] even as she is streaming this service
[28:07] right now father i pray
[28:11] send the angels of mercy
[28:14] o god
[28:15] what is cancer
[28:17] it is father something that it just
[28:20] takes a moving of your hand
[28:23] god i pray that you will bless her lord
[28:27] subside the pain away from her and
[28:31] father i pray
[28:32] let there be a miracle father let her
[28:35] stand once again here to testify of your
[28:39] healing mercy and we will be certain to
[28:42] give you praise and honor and glory
[28:45] forever and ever and the church of the
[28:48] living god said
[28:49] amen amen god bless you
[28:54] amen
[29:00] psalms 119
[29:03] and ephesians 1.
[29:22] i love god with a fervency
[29:28] i'm passionate about what i believe
[29:36] i'm a zealot
[29:38] for this message
[29:42] and in a way that i serve god some men
[29:44] call heresy
[29:47] but i love him
[29:50] and
[29:52] i love his word
[29:55] his word is an absolute
[29:59] it is the plum bob
[30:02] it is the measuring line
[30:05] it is the absolute by which all things
[30:09] are measured
[30:11] not by emotion not by sensation
[30:15] not even by signs and wonders because
[30:18] the bible says there will be many that
[30:20] come unto me in that day and they will
[30:22] say lord did not we do this
[30:25] and do that in your name cast out devils
[30:28] heal the sick and so on and so on
[30:31] and he said depart from me you workers
[30:34] of iniquity i never knew you
[30:36] what a horrible
[30:39] thing that would be
[30:41] to think that
[30:43] what you had done
[30:45] he would not recognize
[30:50] i think as a pastor
[30:52] of a church in the message
[30:56] i have it upon my heart always the young
[30:59] people and the different ones
[31:02] i always say father
[31:05] is there someone here in our midst
[31:08] that's maybe never seen
[31:11] the light of this gospel in the way that
[31:14] we see it
[31:18] i don't want to pass one of them
[31:21] i don't want to take it for granted
[31:24] i don't want to look just on the outside
[31:26] because that's pharisitical religion
[31:30] they wash the outside of the cup at the
[31:32] inside
[31:37] psalms 119
[31:40] verses 17
[31:43] excuse me we'll just
[31:45] yeah 17-18
[31:51] deal bountifully with thy servants
[31:55] that i may live
[31:57] and keep thy word
[32:00] open thou mine eyes
[32:04] that i may behold wondrous things
[32:09] out of thy law
[32:11] would you like that this morning let me
[32:14] see wondrous things
[32:17] marvelous things
[32:18] heavenly
[32:20] things
[32:22] turn with me the book of ephesians
[32:24] chapter 1.
[32:29] hallelujah
[32:35] ephesians
[32:37] 1 verses 17 and 18 that the god of our
[32:42] lord jesus christ the father of glory
[32:47] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[32:49] and revelation and the knowledge of him
[32:54] as a pastor that is my
[32:57] prayer for every one of you
[33:02] that the eyes of your understanding be
[33:05] enlightened
[33:08] that you may know what is the hope of
[33:10] his calling
[33:12] what is the riches
[33:14] of the glory
[33:16] of his inheritance
[33:18] in the saints
[33:20] may god add the blessing of the reading
[33:22] of his words you all may be seated
[33:24] this morning in the presence of almighty
[33:27] god
[33:30] what a privilege it is to be a christian
[33:34] to call him our father
[33:37] amen i'm thankful that god doesn't look
[33:41] upon us on the outward but on the inward
[33:44] he
[33:45] looks to where that
[33:47] elect seed is at
[33:54] always when i get touched and i
[33:57] get sensitive my nose
[34:00] tends to run a little bit so if i
[34:03] if i
[34:04] wipe my nose i'm sure you guys will
[34:07] understand i
[34:08] um
[34:10] you know i one time i think i've told
[34:12] you this before i
[34:14] i was kind of upset at the lord that i
[34:16] always cry and weep
[34:19] and
[34:20] get kind of touched and
[34:22] sensitive and
[34:24] some of you sit there this is dry-faced
[34:27] and unemotional and i'm thinking oh my
[34:30] here i am everybody's looking at me
[34:34] and i said lord why'd you make me that
[34:36] way
[34:38] and you know i i
[34:41] and maybe i was a little ashamed of
[34:44] myself if you would
[34:46] well i'll tell you what for the next six
[34:48] months
[34:51] leroy went through the driest spell in
[34:54] his life
[34:59] and i said oh god
[35:02] let me be sensitive
[35:06] i don't care if i cry every service i
[35:09] don't care if i sh
[35:10] if i shout and get excited and
[35:14] make a fool of myself
[35:17] because i'm a fool for christ
[35:20] but whose fool are you
[35:23] you all got to serve somebody i'm glad i
[35:26] served jesus christ
[35:28] hallelujah my friend and my counselor
[35:31] my guide
[35:33] my mediator
[35:35] my hope
[35:36] my trust
[35:37] my all in all
[35:39] i'd like to title my sermon this morning
[35:42] open thou
[35:44] mine eyes
[35:47] i like to take for a subject the eyes of
[35:50] your understanding being enlightened
[35:54] then
[35:57] they knew
[35:59] him
[36:02] so what it takes
[36:04] it takes your lot your eyes of your
[36:07] understanding to be opened
[36:11] and then
[36:13] you'll know him
[36:18] father i pray that everyone here this
[36:20] morning
[36:23] has an eye-opening experience
[36:26] and part not of what the world calls a
[36:29] woke generation but a real
[36:32] woke
[36:34] person
[36:35] that is awoke
[36:37] to the
[36:39] shout of this end time
[36:42] to prepare to get ready because he's
[36:44] coming soon
[36:47] amen
[36:48] one of my most favorite scriptures when
[36:51] i think of eyes becoming open
[36:55] as found in luke
[36:58] chapter 24 and we will be turning to
[37:00] that for a moment but i wish to
[37:03] rehearse some things in your mind
[37:07] this is three days after the
[37:10] crucifixion
[37:15] the disciples
[37:19] their lives have been shattered
[37:23] they're afraid they're fearful of their
[37:25] own lives
[37:27] they've gone into hiding
[37:32] they watched the one that they hoped
[37:35] would set up the kingdom
[37:39] they watched him be crucified
[37:43] and die
[37:48] some of them were the ones that took him
[37:49] down off the cross
[37:52] laid him in a tomb
[37:56] had to hurry up and do it because it was
[37:58] a sabbath
[38:00] and they didn't want to defile the
[38:02] sabbath
[38:04] so they very quickly put some spices and
[38:07] put some grave clothes around him
[38:12] and they scurried off
[38:15] and i'm sure that their hearts
[38:18] were absolutely smitten
[38:23] if any of you have ever lost a loved one
[38:28] and you know that that parting is
[38:32] there's a tearing
[38:35] they're gone
[38:38] never to talk to them again never to
[38:40] speak to them never to hold their hand
[38:44] never to look them in the eye again
[38:46] never to walk down the road with them
[38:48] once again
[38:51] we've all experienced it
[38:55] it's such a tearing death is
[38:58] but here there is two that is
[39:00] on the road to emmaus the bible doesn't
[39:04] even record the name
[39:06] of one of them
[39:09] it only says there's one by the name of
[39:11] cleopas
[39:13] the other one he's just called the other
[39:15] disciple
[39:17] and here they are now they're on a
[39:19] journey
[39:22] imagine they're kind of walking
[39:26] slowly don't have
[39:30] really
[39:32] no zip in their step
[39:34] no fire in the furnace
[39:38] what are we gonna do
[39:42] probably at a slow pace
[39:45] once in a while
[39:48] maybe stopping and looking at one
[39:50] another
[39:53] did it really happen
[39:58] how many of you that have ever been
[39:59] through such a traumatic event
[40:02] after the event or even while you're in
[40:04] the midst of it is this really real
[40:10] so turn with me if you would to luke 24
[40:12] and i wish to just kind of
[40:15] preach and teach as we go along verse by
[40:17] verse
[40:21] luke 24 verse 15.
[40:25] and it came to pass
[40:28] while they communed together and
[40:29] reasoned
[40:32] jesus himself drew near
[40:36] and went with them now here's the
[40:38] resurrected lord jesus
[40:41] and i've told you this multitudes of
[40:43] times this is not
[40:45] alzheimer's or
[40:47] amnesia
[40:53] but every time
[40:55] that christ
[40:57] shows himself after the resurrection
[41:01] never
[41:02] did they recognize him with human eyes
[41:10] and here are two disciples that know
[41:12] what he looks like
[41:15] they've been there
[41:17] they've been with him
[41:18] they know how his voice is
[41:21] they know his stature
[41:26] and jesus
[41:28] drew near
[41:30] he's doing the same thing this morning
[41:36] but their eyes were holding they should
[41:38] not know him
[41:41] father i wonder how many are sitting
[41:44] here right now
[41:47] that are in the same situation that they
[41:50] can't really see him
[41:53] they're so caught up in carnal things
[41:58] and life and life has just
[42:01] cares about it if you're not careful
[42:03] it'll choke the seed
[42:05] and it becomes lifeless
[42:08] don't ever let the cares of life do that
[42:10] to you
[42:14] the bible says in her eyes we're holding
[42:21] they didn't know it was him
[42:24] i wonder how many times
[42:27] a song is sung
[42:30] and something about that song
[42:34] you were blessed there was an anointing
[42:38] i wonder if he's passing by
[42:42] and you missed it
[42:47] and he said unto them in verse 17
[42:50] what manner of communication
[42:53] are these that you have one to another
[42:55] and as you walk
[42:57] and you're so sad
[43:01] what does this communication tell me
[43:06] and one of them whose name was cleopas
[43:08] answering
[43:10] said unto him art thou only a stranger
[43:12] in jerusalem
[43:14] haven't you been around don't you know
[43:16] what's been happening
[43:20] why there's been all kinds of events and
[43:24] hosanna to the highest and
[43:28] good friday and on and on and oh my
[43:33] there's been a trial and a
[43:35] crucifixion
[43:38] where have you been man are you a
[43:40] stranger
[43:48] that's that well not known which
[43:50] these things which are come to pass or
[43:52] they're in these days he said to them
[43:54] what things
[43:56] he want to hear from them what things
[43:58] what
[43:58] tell me come on fill me in
[44:02] i haven't been here i've been
[44:04] locked away
[44:09] i've been doing something in secret
[44:13] i've been busy
[44:16] so fill me in what kind of things
[44:19] they said to me and concerning jesus of
[44:21] nazareth
[44:23] which was a mighty prophet indeed in
[44:26] word before god and all the people
[44:30] and i'm sure he probably said oh yeah
[44:34] really maybe testing them a little bit
[44:38] sometimes i think god tests you
[44:41] oh you
[44:42] you sing that song these are the days of
[44:45] elijah
[44:47] oh really
[44:53] god tell you if you really really had
[44:55] the true revelation let's see these are
[44:58] you know what
[45:00] i've seen elijah
[45:02] i've heard him preach
[45:06] these are the days
[45:08] of elijah
[45:10] how many of the
[45:12] millions of people
[45:14] in regular christendom
[45:17] sing that song
[45:19] and we're the only ones that seeing it
[45:21] come to pass
[45:24] we've seen the elijah
[45:31] and how the chief priests and their
[45:33] rulers delivered him to be condemned to
[45:35] death and
[45:36] they crucified him
[45:42] but we trusted
[45:44] then it had been he
[45:48] we should redeem all israel
[45:52] besides all this today's the third day
[45:55] since these things were done
[46:01] yay and
[46:02] guess what
[46:05] certain
[46:08] women also of our company of our group
[46:11] of our
[46:12] message followers
[46:16] you know what they did
[46:18] they made us astonished
[46:22] which were early at the sepulcher so now
[46:24] they're playing the scenario
[46:28] some of the message believers went there
[46:30] and they went
[46:31] to the sepulcher
[46:35] and when they found nana's body they
[46:36] came saying
[46:38] that they had
[46:40] also seen a vision of angels
[46:45] which said that he was alive
[46:48] now i want all of you to understand that
[46:51] when the supernatural
[46:53] takes place among us many times we miss
[46:56] it because we're too carnal
[47:04] the bible says be careful because
[47:05] sometimes you will
[47:07] entertain
[47:08] angels and you won't even be aware of it
[47:15] verse 24 and a certain of them which
[47:17] were with us went to the sepulcher and
[47:19] found it even so as the women had said
[47:25] but him
[47:26] they saw not
[47:29] then he said unto them o fools
[47:32] and slow of heart
[47:34] to believe all that the prophets have
[47:36] spoken
[47:42] ought not christ who have suffered these
[47:44] sayings
[47:45] and to enter into his glory
[47:48] and beginning at moses and all the
[47:50] prophets
[47:53] he expounded unto them in all the
[47:56] scripture
[47:58] concerning
[48:01] the things concerning
[48:04] himself wow
[48:07] wouldn't you like to been there
[48:10] and moses said
[48:12] there'll be a prophet likened unto me
[48:15] you see and and just go on he took the
[48:18] prophets jeremiah isaiah ezekiel he
[48:22] began to take all of the different
[48:24] prophets and he began and you know what
[48:26] he was doing he was identifying his
[48:29] ministry in scripture
[48:32] and wow
[48:34] you talk about a sermon
[48:38] and no doubt that probably as they're
[48:39] walking along and then christ makes a
[48:42] makes a real point and and jeremiah said
[48:47] and
[48:48] they stop and they look at him
[48:52] and this one that their eyes are still
[48:54] not recognizing that it's him
[48:57] look at him intently
[49:00] and are trying to figure out
[49:02] i thought this guy is a stranger
[49:06] listen to what he said my
[49:10] i'll tell you what that message is just
[49:13] burning inside of me
[49:15] does not it stir your heart
[49:22] that's what the word of god will do to
[49:24] everyone
[49:26] who is an elect seed
[49:28] it'll stir you
[49:30] amen
[49:37] and when they drew nyan to the village
[49:41] whether they went and he made as though
[49:44] he would have gone further
[49:48] he wanted
[49:50] to be asked to stay
[49:54] i'm going to give you
[49:55] a clue about god
[49:58] god wants you to ask him
[50:01] to stay
[50:05] how many times does he come
[50:08] and he draws nigh
[50:12] and you know what he just says well i've
[50:14] got to be going now
[50:17] you ever had him bless you
[50:19] while you're reading the scripture
[50:23] and then all of a sudden says but i've
[50:24] got to go now
[50:27] you ever been singing a song and you're
[50:29] mildly blessed and
[50:31] he says excuse me
[50:35] time's up i i
[50:37] i really need to be going
[50:41] i wonder how many of you have ever
[50:43] persevered long enough and
[50:45] compelled him and said lord stay here
[50:48] with me
[50:53] that's all he asks you to do is
[50:56] lord stay here with me
[50:59] the day is far spin this is evening time
[51:01] this is louder you see it god whatever
[51:03] you do
[51:06] don't leave me so quickly
[51:09] i need you is this darkness in this
[51:12] age that we're living in
[51:14] i need you i compel you lord would you
[51:17] the days were spent
[51:22] stay with us
[51:28] the bible says and they constrained him
[51:35] you look
[51:37] sometimes you can tell if people are
[51:40] real serious or not
[51:42] on their reaction on what you're gonna
[51:44] do
[51:46] well i think i'll go okay
[51:49] thank you for stopping by i'm sure you
[51:51] know whenever you're in the area stop in
[51:54] are kind of like paying the
[51:56] the bill when you grab the check and
[51:58] they say
[51:59] oh no let me have it
[52:02] but they don't reach for it
[52:06] you know the difference between the guy
[52:08] who says no
[52:10] i want it
[52:12] because i've had a tug of war i am a
[52:14] giver
[52:18] and when i see
[52:19] different ones hey that you know oh well
[52:21] hey let me pay the bill
[52:24] you can kind of slide it toward them and
[52:26] they're they're going oh you know the
[52:27] weather sure is nice today
[52:29] kind of change the subject
[52:37] by the way
[52:39] jean tambour do you like my shoes
[52:44] yeah
[52:46] he got him for me
[52:50] amazing
[52:52] all of a sudden i get some shoes
[52:54] show up
[52:56] wow
[52:58] amazing thank you god bless you richly
[53:06] but they constrained him
[53:07] saying abide with us for
[53:10] it's toward evening and the day is far
[53:12] spent and he went in to terry with him
[53:14] and it came to pass as he sat at meat
[53:20] he took bread
[53:23] now it has to be more than just a
[53:26] regular bread because this is just a
[53:28] symbol
[53:30] jesus says i
[53:33] am the bread which came down from heaven
[53:36] your fathers did eat manna from the
[53:38] wilderness and everyone did
[53:42] but he that will eat of this bread
[53:46] and they constrain him and he took the
[53:48] bread and when he blew when he break it
[53:50] guess what their eyes came open
[53:55] oh god i pray may there be lots of
[53:57] breaking of bread here in this church
[54:00] and through every bible and in every one
[54:03] of your prayer closets and all the time
[54:05] that you seek god and ask god for
[54:07] revelation may he break your bread
[54:11] [Music]
[54:12] and your eyes come open
[54:19] and they knew him
[54:22] my god
[54:26] my
[54:28] it's him
[54:31] and they knew him
[54:34] and like god who
[54:37] loves to come make himself known to you
[54:40] and become so dynamic how many of you
[54:42] have been in a service
[54:44] been reading your bible been listening
[54:46] to a tape and singing a song been doing
[54:49] something and all of a sudden his
[54:51] presence comes by and it's so
[54:53] overwhelming and
[54:55] and you just have a moment with god and
[54:57] for moments maybe your heavenly places
[55:00] in christ jesus
[55:03] and
[55:04] suddenly he pulls back into the
[55:07] invisible realm
[55:10] because he makes himself known then he
[55:12] vanishes
[55:15] god does that many times in your life
[55:20] he doesn't
[55:21] come
[55:22] let me give you an example
[55:24] when we come to church and there are
[55:26] certain times when you either preach a
[55:29] sermon you sing a song or do something
[55:31] in my the presence of god comes down
[55:36] and you could sing that song or preach
[55:38] that same sermon again and guess what
[55:41] it's dry
[55:46] he vanishes
[55:49] and he goes back into that unseen realm
[55:53] because we do not walk
[55:56] by sight
[55:58] but by
[56:00] faith and they said one to another did
[56:03] not our hearts burn within us
[56:06] while he talked with us by the way
[56:09] and while he opened to us
[56:13] the scriptures
[56:18] god open our eyes of understanding to
[56:21] your scriptures
[56:24] is it possible that eyes
[56:27] could actually beholden and he could be
[56:30] here with us
[56:31] he could be doing things here among us
[56:33] and
[56:34] our eyes are missing it because we're
[56:36] looking at the wrong thing
[56:38] amen
[56:42] second corinthians
[56:44] 4 verses 3 and 4. but if our gospel is
[56:47] hid
[56:50] it is hid to them that are lost
[56:54] in whom the god of this world hath
[56:56] blinded the minds of them which believe
[56:58] not
[56:59] who blinded their minds
[57:01] the god of this world
[57:05] who cares what they think
[57:09] that's why
[57:11] i don't care
[57:13] what the movie
[57:15] stars
[57:16] and the rock and roll singers
[57:19] and the wealthy of this world have got
[57:21] to say
[57:23] who asked you
[57:28] in whom the god of this world had
[57:31] blinded their minds
[57:35] the revelation of the gospel of jesus
[57:37] christ
[57:39] is the means by which one soul is
[57:42] delivered from the powers of darkness
[57:45] oh satan has powers
[57:47] the bible says
[57:49] that satan has power
[57:51] but god is an almighty power
[57:55] light is far greater than darkness
[58:00] a darkened mind
[58:03] is one that the power of satan has come
[58:06] and brought to him
[58:08] an altered state of his mind and he sees
[58:12] things differently and boy if we don't
[58:15] see that around in the world today and
[58:17] the way they're acting you want to say
[58:19] is any of them normal no they're not
[58:23] why because the god of this world has
[58:24] blinded their minds
[58:30] you can ask a supreme court nominee
[58:34] what is a woman
[58:39] i don't think i can answer you
[58:42] i'm not a biologist
[58:45] oh
[58:46] you see how far
[58:48] science and education will take you
[58:50] why a third grader
[59:00] an
[59:00] unenlightened mind is a mind that is
[59:04] carnal and cannot understand the things
[59:07] of god
[59:08] they have eyes to see but they see not
[59:10] they have ears to hear but they hear not
[59:14] jesus always spake
[59:16] in parables to the people is that right
[59:19] do you know that this message is a
[59:21] parable to unbelievers
[59:24] hey we have a language that we talk all
[59:28] that hey
[59:29] a normal guy out there he got no idea
[59:31] you talk about predestination talk about
[59:33] elect seed talk about rapture you know
[59:36] we i was speaking something about that
[59:38] the other day and newcomer that was here
[59:41] is saying hey
[59:42] rapture's not even in the bible
[59:45] we know that
[59:47] it's a
[59:48] label
[59:50] that they've put to the catching away oh
[59:52] yeah catching a ways in the bible
[59:57] and just as i've preached that sermon
[59:58] being caught up how many of you really
[1:00:01] realize that what god has done by
[1:00:03] sharing with you the revelation of this
[1:00:06] message he's actually caught you up
[1:00:10] and i'll be so bold to tell you this
[1:00:12] that if you are not caught up
[1:00:14] in this message right now you'll not be
[1:00:17] caught up when he catches them up
[1:00:24] oh you might be busy doing your career
[1:00:27] or studying or making money and he'll
[1:00:29] leave you right here
[1:00:31] i thank god that i've been caught up
[1:00:34] with this thing since i was 18 years old
[1:00:37] praise god i'm not ashamed of it
[1:00:41] and i've been preaching the same thing
[1:00:43] i'm preaching
[1:00:44] since i was 18 and i'll soon be 70.
[1:00:50] so
[1:00:51] don't say well you're just an old man
[1:00:54] yeah well i am an old man
[1:00:56] but
[1:00:57] i was saying the same thing
[1:01:00] when i was young
[1:01:02] yeah
[1:01:09] i've been pondering over this idea about
[1:01:11] opening eyes
[1:01:13] and about this woke generation that we
[1:01:15] he we see around us
[1:01:18] isn't it amazing that god will say that
[1:01:21] there are some people that have eyes but
[1:01:23] they don't see
[1:01:25] there'll be some that have ears and they
[1:01:27] don't hear
[1:01:29] so i want to take a closer look at that
[1:01:31] brother bram says in the door inside a
[1:01:33] door
[1:01:37] you might say to me i got good eyesight
[1:01:39] mr branham well i'm thankful for that
[1:01:43] but you might
[1:01:46] ever see such a good physical sight and
[1:01:48] be spiritually blind
[1:01:51] let god open your spiritual sight after
[1:01:54] all
[1:01:55] you don't see with your eyes did you
[1:01:57] know that
[1:01:58] no you look with your eyes you see with
[1:02:02] your heart
[1:02:05] saint john 3 says except a man be born
[1:02:07] again
[1:02:08] he cannot see the kingdom of god and he
[1:02:11] cannot understand the kingdom of god
[1:02:13] until
[1:02:15] you're born again
[1:02:19] you see seeing something with the
[1:02:21] physical eye is not believing
[1:02:24] why'd they tell us everywhere
[1:02:27] seeing's not believing
[1:02:30] in fact some of you have seen some
[1:02:34] supernatural
[1:02:36] events in your life perhaps
[1:02:39] you've seen an angel
[1:02:43] or you've seen a
[1:02:45] ghost
[1:02:46] or you've seen a ufo
[1:02:49] or you've seen something unexplainable
[1:02:52] and after you get done
[1:02:54] you go did i really see that
[1:02:57] in fact brother brennam said
[1:03:01] he said you will be judged you know on
[1:03:03] the picture of the pillar of fire
[1:03:07] above his head
[1:03:12] he said for those that were there
[1:03:14] that had even seen it
[1:03:17] he said you know they could have it
[1:03:20] could have been there for just a moment
[1:03:21] and
[1:03:22] gone and wow
[1:03:25] was that just the light on the wall what
[1:03:27] was that i did i really see that but he
[1:03:30] said the picture that captured it
[1:03:34] do you know that there was a woman
[1:03:36] i believe it was a woman
[1:03:38] that looked at that picture and
[1:03:40] snickered
[1:03:43] brother bram said she blasphemed the
[1:03:44] holy ghost
[1:03:46] because god allowed his picture to be
[1:03:48] taken
[1:03:50] and says will hold you accountable on
[1:03:53] what you think about it
[1:04:03] that man that went to brother branham
[1:04:05] you remember said smiley blinds mind me
[1:04:08] blind
[1:04:13] now if it would have been me
[1:04:16] i'd have probably asked god to do it
[1:04:20] but brother brenham
[1:04:23] such a seasoned
[1:04:25] minister of christ here in the unwelcome
[1:04:28] christ he said i said brother
[1:04:30] you're just born blind that's all
[1:04:33] you were born blind and i doubt whether
[1:04:35] you'll ever receive your sight or not
[1:04:38] i said i'd rather
[1:04:41] be physical blind
[1:04:43] than to be spiritually blind like that
[1:04:47] well i said you'd be far better off
[1:04:50] if you were everyone totally blind had
[1:04:54] to be let around
[1:04:55] by your your arms so you don't have no
[1:04:58] eyes let somebody your eyes lead you
[1:05:02] you'd be far better off but i said
[1:05:04] because the things that the prophets has
[1:05:08] longed to see and you see these things
[1:05:10] that great men long to see and still you
[1:05:13] won't believe it
[1:05:16] i said well did isaiah speak of you
[1:05:19] right
[1:05:21] seeing you have eyes and can't see in
[1:05:24] ears and you can't hear
[1:05:26] we know that the faith is the sixth
[1:05:28] sense
[1:05:29] faith is the sense that god uses for
[1:05:32] each one of you
[1:05:35] of all the five physical senses
[1:05:39] faith is far above that
[1:05:42] faith doesn't reason
[1:05:46] faith believes
[1:05:48] faith obeys
[1:05:52] and there are many times in your life
[1:05:54] that god will require you to walk out by
[1:05:57] faith and you don't see a result before
[1:06:00] you move god is waiting for you to act
[1:06:03] first then the ram will appear
[1:06:07] some of you have been so pacified
[1:06:12] so much babied
[1:06:14] you're afraid of faith
[1:06:17] you're afraid to change a job or go
[1:06:20] somewhere else or to do something
[1:06:23] in the name of the lord because oh uh
[1:06:25] well i i better sell my house first no
[1:06:29] if god tells you to move move god will
[1:06:31] sell your house
[1:06:35] too much of the time we got it backwards
[1:06:37] don't we
[1:06:40] abraham
[1:06:42] who is the father of our faith
[1:06:46] god told him to go
[1:06:48] where
[1:06:50] just go
[1:06:51] i'll show you where to go
[1:06:54] it's like telling your family get in the
[1:06:55] car and get the kids and they're all
[1:06:57] sitting there but where are we going
[1:06:58] where are we going where are we just
[1:07:02] i'll tell you when we get there
[1:07:04] and every five minutes are we there yet
[1:07:08] saints of god let me tell you this race
[1:07:10] is just about over
[1:07:12] we're just about there how much longer
[1:07:15] hang on
[1:07:17] i don't know
[1:07:18] but i i say this if he doesn't come next
[1:07:21] week
[1:07:24] then i'll be serving him
[1:07:27] the week after
[1:07:28] if he doesn't come that week see it
[1:07:31] we're going to be serving him
[1:07:35] just like abraham
[1:07:38] i've got some things in my heart that'll
[1:07:39] be sharing with you in the next little
[1:07:40] bit but abraham you see
[1:07:43] what happened abraham's wife sarah began
[1:07:45] to get nervous
[1:07:48] it ain't happening
[1:07:51] uh you see it wouldn't have been such a
[1:07:53] great miracle for them to have kids when
[1:07:55] they're young
[1:07:59] still having husband and wife relation
[1:08:01] yeah hey
[1:08:03] but then pretty soon it gets where he's
[1:08:06] old she's old he's as good as dead she's
[1:08:09] as good as dead
[1:08:12] and so god says well what do you think
[1:08:14] abraham
[1:08:16] i told you you're going to have a son
[1:08:18] praise god
[1:08:21] i love how brother brenham reenacts it
[1:08:24] so much of the time
[1:08:26] he comes in there as an old man hey
[1:08:29] sarah
[1:08:31] how you feeling hon
[1:08:33] nothing
[1:08:37] praise god
[1:08:39] we're going to have it anyway
[1:08:42] you see god don't need your help
[1:08:44] amen
[1:08:48] god sometimes lets you get into a
[1:08:50] situation where you have exhausted all
[1:08:53] of your resources you have done
[1:08:55] everything to deliver yourself and when
[1:08:58] you finally said i've done everything
[1:09:01] i've spent all my living and i've none
[1:09:04] the better
[1:09:06] he said are you done
[1:09:09] are you done yeah
[1:09:10] yes
[1:09:14] let go and let god amen
[1:09:17] you know what saints of god i'm learning
[1:09:18] to lean
[1:09:22] i'm learning to lean on him
[1:09:25] not on my own understanding because my
[1:09:27] own understanding drives me crazy
[1:09:30] wacko
[1:09:32] but if i learn to lean on him
[1:09:34] i'm learning somebody say i'm learning
[1:09:37] yeah i don't act like you're all there
[1:09:39] and you you got it all and you you know
[1:09:41] exactly no there's a lot of times you're
[1:09:43] going through things and you're still
[1:09:44] learning
[1:09:51] second corinthians 5 7 says for we walk
[1:09:54] by faith not by sight
[1:09:58] amen
[1:10:01] we walk
[1:10:03] walking is fellowship
[1:10:08] does the bible talk about a man who
[1:10:10] walked with god
[1:10:13] brother brenham said
[1:10:15] that enoch walked with god and he was
[1:10:17] not for god took him
[1:10:21] now catch this because brother branham
[1:10:22] said enoch walk by faith
[1:10:26] so imagine
[1:10:28] he's walking one day
[1:10:30] and brother branham says he's
[1:10:33] getting so close to god because he's
[1:10:35] walking by revelation and he's probably
[1:10:38] thinking on heavenly things
[1:10:41] he's probably having god so absorb him
[1:10:45] and catching him up into heavenly places
[1:10:48] oh lord
[1:10:50] i just
[1:10:51] can't wait to just go
[1:10:54] and to be with you
[1:10:55] and all of a sudden his foot don't come
[1:10:57] down
[1:11:01] brother rem said he stepped into his
[1:11:03] revelation
[1:11:06] brother brenham said to the bride of
[1:11:07] christ she is waiting for what
[1:11:11] the revelation of the rapture
[1:11:15] because it's a revelation
[1:11:17] you say well uh how's it going hey
[1:11:20] listen i'm not here to try to work it
[1:11:22] out in all the details and i really
[1:11:23] don't care
[1:11:25] all i know is i'm a part of what he's
[1:11:28] doing now therefore i'll be a part of
[1:11:30] what he'll do then
[1:11:33] all i gotta do is just keep walking
[1:11:36] quit you know how many people quit
[1:11:39] how many people take a uh uh
[1:11:43] they hit the ditch here or there they
[1:11:44] quit going to church they quit
[1:11:46] fellowship why
[1:11:49] they quit walking
[1:11:51] keep walking
[1:11:53] amen
[1:11:58] hebrews 11 verses 1 through 3 says now
[1:12:01] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:12:03] for in the evidence of things not seen
[1:12:06] for by it what faith
[1:12:08] the elders obtained a good report
[1:12:10] through faith we understand that the
[1:12:12] worlds were framed by the word of god so
[1:12:14] that things which are seen
[1:12:17] were made of things which do
[1:12:21] up here
[1:12:23] wow
[1:12:24] i'll tell you the more that you try to
[1:12:26] figure this all out
[1:12:29] and how old the earth is
[1:12:31] and god said that in so many days he
[1:12:35] made the earth and this and that and
[1:12:37] what about the
[1:12:39] the the dinosaurs and
[1:12:41] uh
[1:12:46] i tell you what
[1:12:48] it's amazing i worked on an
[1:12:50] archaeological dig in northern
[1:12:51] california for dr louis leakey any of
[1:12:54] you ever heard of dr louis leakey some
[1:12:56] of the old people
[1:12:59] one of the most famous archaeologists in
[1:13:01] the world dr louis leakey
[1:13:03] we're on an alluvial fan in calico
[1:13:06] california
[1:13:08] and i am the site photographer
[1:13:12] for an archaeological dig they've got
[1:13:14] the squares and you've seen it on
[1:13:16] uh national geographic
[1:13:19] and they sit there and they dig and they
[1:13:21] have brushes and they get so and every
[1:13:24] rock every little stone they do well
[1:13:26] whenever there's something that maybe
[1:13:28] looks a little bit unusual
[1:13:31] they have the site photographer come
[1:13:33] over there and before you move the
[1:13:34] object you take pictures of it
[1:13:37] that's what i did so all day i'm running
[1:13:39] back and forth and everything well they
[1:13:41] found a uh a round circle
[1:13:44] of stones
[1:13:48] and they took a stone out of this
[1:13:52] circular
[1:13:53] uh set of stones they took a stone out
[1:13:55] of there and they cut it up
[1:13:58] and they could tell that the inside part
[1:14:01] of the stone had received heat while the
[1:14:04] outside of the stone had not
[1:14:07] so they said it's a fireplace
[1:14:10] it's the first known
[1:14:12] fireplace of ancient man on north
[1:14:15] american
[1:14:16] continent
[1:14:19] and everything and so then they they
[1:14:21] date this
[1:14:22] and i'm thinking oh wow
[1:14:25] this is amazing imagine these people
[1:14:27] sitting around the campfire
[1:14:29] look like a bunch of monkeys sitting
[1:14:30] there
[1:14:32] right because crow magnet man
[1:14:36] didn't any of you go to school
[1:14:44] what's amazing to them
[1:14:48] is to them they sit there and they
[1:14:50] preach it this is true this is this is
[1:14:52] it
[1:14:53] but you know what to them
[1:14:56] it is truth
[1:14:59] they came from a beast
[1:15:02] they're going back to a beast
[1:15:04] it's not true for us
[1:15:06] why because i come from god i'm going
[1:15:07] back to god
[1:15:13] you say well seeing is believing are you
[1:15:15] sure
[1:15:17] matthew 13. let me go to a couple
[1:15:19] scriptures here and try to
[1:15:22] come to a point here in just a moment
[1:15:25] matthew 13 verses 13 through 17
[1:15:28] therefore
[1:15:29] i speak to them in parable because they
[1:15:32] seeing see not
[1:15:34] and hearing they hear not neither do
[1:15:36] they understand and in them is fulfilled
[1:15:39] the prophecy of isaias
[1:15:42] which saith by hearing ye shall hear and
[1:15:45] shall not understand
[1:15:47] and seeing ye shall see and shall not
[1:15:49] perceive
[1:15:50] for this people's heart is waxed gross
[1:15:54] and their ears are dull of hearing and
[1:15:56] their eyes they have clothes less at any
[1:15:59] time they should see with their eyes and
[1:16:01] hear with their ears and should
[1:16:02] understand with their heart and should
[1:16:04] be converted and i should heal them
[1:16:07] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[1:16:09] and your ears for they hear
[1:16:14] for verily i say unto you
[1:16:16] that many prophets and righteous men
[1:16:18] have desired to see those things which
[1:16:21] ye see
[1:16:23] and have not seen them
[1:16:25] and to hear those things which he hear
[1:16:28] and have not heard them
[1:16:31] and revelation is actually the opening
[1:16:33] of your understanding to the scripture
[1:16:36] revelation is always associated with an
[1:16:39] illuminated mind
[1:16:44] unbelief is always associated with
[1:16:46] darkness and confusion
[1:16:50] any man can open the bible if he knows
[1:16:53] how to read
[1:16:57] and he can read the same words that we
[1:16:59] do and receive nothing
[1:17:03] i'll tell you how powerful the word is
[1:17:06] do any of you ever underline and
[1:17:08] highlight parts of your bible
[1:17:14] wow
[1:17:15] why did i never see that before man i
[1:17:17] get out the yellow
[1:17:19] i put an asterisk like that sometimes i
[1:17:22] write in there amen hallelujah i get
[1:17:24] excited just writing all over my bible
[1:17:28] i come back even a week later thinking i
[1:17:30] have exhausted everything from that
[1:17:33] scripture
[1:17:35] i read it again and it's it's
[1:17:38] totally new
[1:17:39] how did i miss that
[1:17:41] how many of you have listened to a tape
[1:17:43] of the prophet before and you've heard
[1:17:45] it and you've heard it and you thought
[1:17:46] you cleaned everything out of it and go
[1:17:48] back to a little bit later it's a whole
[1:17:50] new tape
[1:17:51] and i'll tell you what a lot of this has
[1:17:53] to do with your spiritual maturing
[1:17:56] when you're a little child you thought
[1:17:58] as a child understood as a child
[1:18:00] but as you grow in christ i trust that
[1:18:03] every one of you
[1:18:05] are seeking god did god give you
[1:18:07] revelation
[1:18:09] because you can half of the tapes and
[1:18:11] books and still miss it
[1:18:14] you can go to church and hear the
[1:18:15] sermons
[1:18:16] and still miss it
[1:18:20] i want to be so
[1:18:22] very earnest with all of you i wonder
[1:18:24] how many of you have ever really gotten
[1:18:28] so serious with god
[1:18:30] that you say god show me
[1:18:34] who you are
[1:18:36] let me see for myself
[1:18:42] if you'll do that
[1:18:45] he'll show you
[1:18:47] that's why i i ask any of you that have
[1:18:50] never really
[1:18:51] maybe you've been just caught up in the
[1:18:53] vortex of this message
[1:18:57] and you've just been going along with it
[1:18:58] maybe you were born in it
[1:19:01] some of the young people born in this
[1:19:03] message are the hardest to get converted
[1:19:07] you know why
[1:19:08] they become complacent
[1:19:11] oh well i wear a
[1:19:13] i wear a dress
[1:19:15] i don't cut my hair
[1:19:17] uh you know i go to church
[1:19:20] so by your conduct
[1:19:23] okay well i guess and if we're not
[1:19:25] careful what happens
[1:19:27] is we look at the outside and we said
[1:19:29] well i guess they're okay
[1:19:35] i guess they're okay
[1:19:37] and they go on for years
[1:19:40] until they come to a time when it's
[1:19:43] their decision maybe they move out of
[1:19:45] the house
[1:19:46] maybe for the 18 or 20 years because i i
[1:19:50] know that when my kids were growing up
[1:19:52] in my home
[1:19:54] i said i am a christian this is a
[1:19:56] christian home i place a token over this
[1:19:59] house and i don't care how much you want
[1:20:01] a tv you ain't getting one
[1:20:04] i'm the papa bear in this fairy tale
[1:20:08] and if you don't have the conviction
[1:20:10] enough i do
[1:20:12] now there are many believers today and i
[1:20:14] don't know about your home maybe you're
[1:20:16] one of them
[1:20:18] that says well my kids can do what they
[1:20:20] want to do and if they want a television
[1:20:23] in their their room why i tell you what
[1:20:25] then i'll just have to respect that
[1:20:28] i want to ask you where are you daddy
[1:20:32] i thought you said you applied to token
[1:20:34] to the home well i'll tell you what you
[1:20:36] know if she wants to wear some skin down
[1:20:38] wiener dress and
[1:20:40] and she wants to act like that and if
[1:20:41] johnny wants to go ahead and put on his
[1:20:43] shorts and and go out there and be with
[1:20:45] the rest of the boys
[1:20:48] where is the conviction
[1:20:56] yeah it's true
[1:20:59] my kids did not have
[1:21:02] a lot of choices
[1:21:05] you can go to church
[1:21:07] you go to the youth meeting
[1:21:09] you can go to church
[1:21:11] you can go
[1:21:12] to come on we
[1:21:14] it's more than that but that's that's
[1:21:16] really about all they see
[1:21:19] and so i had restrictions
[1:21:24] because i have enough
[1:21:27] conviction of god
[1:21:29] that i said okay now listen because this
[1:21:31] is my house
[1:21:33] i'm the high priest of this home
[1:21:36] you may not agree with this and you may
[1:21:38] not like it and when you get old enough
[1:21:40] you can
[1:21:41] you can move out
[1:21:43] and then you can be big bad bill you can
[1:21:45] go ahead and live any way you want to
[1:21:49] but while you're in my house joshua said
[1:21:52] as far as me and my house
[1:21:55] we'll serve the lord
[1:21:59] otherwise what we do is we just say well
[1:22:01] we want them to get their own revelation
[1:22:03] uh-huh
[1:22:05] oh sure
[1:22:07] so you let them just go ahead and live
[1:22:09] any kind of and you know what you're
[1:22:11] doing to your house when you let that in
[1:22:14] you're defiling your house
[1:22:17] now i don't know why i'm going off on
[1:22:18] some of these things here but i just
[1:22:20] kind of feel to do it
[1:22:24] because we're seeing a morphing within
[1:22:27] the message
[1:22:31] i wonder what the next generation is
[1:22:33] going to look like
[1:22:40] if the lord tarries another 10 years
[1:22:44] what will a message believer look like
[1:22:49] will the ministry have lowered the
[1:22:51] standard so much and allowed the
[1:22:54] camel to get in the tent that pretty
[1:22:56] soon
[1:22:57] there's no more holiness do you know
[1:22:59] holiness is not a way of dressing
[1:23:03] holiness is a relationship between you
[1:23:06] and god and if we're not careful
[1:23:09] even the apostle paul said look i want
[1:23:11] to tell you corinthian group be not
[1:23:13] conformed
[1:23:15] but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:23:18] your mind
[1:23:20] if we're not careful what we've done
[1:23:22] we've conformed everybody and we've made
[1:23:24] them according to their conduct and we
[1:23:25] say they've got in yet inside
[1:23:29] they've never had that place where their
[1:23:32] eyes were opened
[1:23:34] i don't know about you but i
[1:23:36] i love god
[1:23:38] and i love this message
[1:23:42] amen how many of you love the lord
[1:23:44] amen
[1:23:47] now i've
[1:23:48] i remember and brother paul i'm going to
[1:23:50] use you an example
[1:23:51] paul was struggling here
[1:23:53] a while back
[1:23:56] paul's a
[1:23:58] a ball player
[1:24:00] played sports most of his life
[1:24:02] had the team here with the church and so
[1:24:04] on and so forth
[1:24:06] and he wasn't doing right
[1:24:08] i said paul
[1:24:11] i need you to get in the game
[1:24:13] did i tell you that paul
[1:24:19] i said i need you to get in the game
[1:24:23] i need you to get serious
[1:24:26] i i and i'm just i just provoking him
[1:24:30] onto good works
[1:24:32] and not allowing him to throw all the
[1:24:35] excuses of why he couldn't
[1:24:38] and i talked to him out here in front of
[1:24:40] the church the other day
[1:24:41] i said paul i love it
[1:24:44] i love it i said when i come to church
[1:24:47] and i said we're singing a song you
[1:24:49] stand up ain't nobody else standing up
[1:24:54] i said paul what happened
[1:24:56] what'd you tell me
[1:25:06] yeah you get the holy ghost
[1:25:10] that's all you need young people
[1:25:14] i don't want you to just go to church
[1:25:16] once you get the holy ghost
[1:25:26] and i as a pastor
[1:25:29] of this end time
[1:25:31] i'm saying god let me stir
[1:25:34] the people
[1:25:35] let me stir them and if they don't have
[1:25:37] the holy ghost and they don't know if
[1:25:39] they've got it or not i'll tell you if
[1:25:40] you don't know you got it you ain't got
[1:25:42] it
[1:25:44] because there's an assurance when you
[1:25:46] get it
[1:25:47] oh yeah
[1:25:48] you know what there's a lot of times
[1:25:51] when you don't feel like you got the
[1:25:53] holy ghost because god's weaning you
[1:25:55] away from feelings
[1:25:57] a lot of times you don't feel saved
[1:26:03] oh yeah
[1:26:05] skies brass
[1:26:07] things are going rough
[1:26:09] ain't no blessing nowhere you can't find
[1:26:11] no anointing read your bible listen to
[1:26:13] it tape
[1:26:15] i'm going crazy
[1:26:18] you know what god's just seeing what
[1:26:19] kind of reaction you got and he wants to
[1:26:23] see your reaction to his action
[1:26:29] saul
[1:26:30] saul of tarsus is probably the best
[1:26:33] example of a guy
[1:26:35] who was religious
[1:26:37] and concerning the law was blameless i
[1:26:41] was born a pharisee my father was a
[1:26:44] pharisee i've got the lineage of
[1:26:45] pharisees concerning the law of
[1:26:47] blameless i was taught by gamilio and of
[1:26:50] course and he just he just brags and
[1:26:53] brags and brags
[1:26:55] but one day
[1:26:58] one day
[1:27:00] he met god
[1:27:02] you see
[1:27:03] elect seeds can go a long time until
[1:27:07] god gets hold of him
[1:27:09] and god got a hold of him god had to
[1:27:11] blind him to open his eyes
[1:27:14] in acts 26 i'm going to just show you
[1:27:17] very quickly
[1:27:19] musicians you go ahead and come because
[1:27:20] i'm going to try to bring this to
[1:27:23] i'm only on page four and i get
[1:27:27] that's okay 12.
[1:27:33] at midday oh king
[1:27:36] he's brought before the sanhedrin
[1:27:38] council
[1:27:41] this is the highest court of the law
[1:27:44] in the land
[1:27:47] at midday o king
[1:27:51] i saw on the way a light from heaven
[1:27:54] above the brightness of the sun
[1:27:59] shining around about me
[1:28:01] and them which journeyed with me
[1:28:05] and when we were all fallen to the earth
[1:28:09] i heard a voice speaking unto me
[1:28:12] saying in the hebrew tongue
[1:28:16] saul saw
[1:28:20] why persecute us thou me
[1:28:23] is it hard for thee to kick against the
[1:28:25] pricks
[1:28:28] and i said who art thou lord
[1:28:33] brother branham said here's a pharisee
[1:28:36] a one who's not good he's going to say
[1:28:38] who art thou
[1:28:40] elohim
[1:28:43] tell me who you are who art thou elohim
[1:28:51] he said i am jesus
[1:28:53] whom thou persecute us
[1:28:56] but arise and stand upon thy feet
[1:29:01] for i have appeared unto thee for this
[1:29:04] purpose
[1:29:07] to make thee a minister
[1:29:09] now stop here for a moment because god
[1:29:12] never does anything without a purpose
[1:29:14] i've appeared to thee for a purpose
[1:29:17] every time god appears to you every time
[1:29:19] god gives you a revelation every time
[1:29:22] god does something to open your eyes it
[1:29:25] has a purpose behind it
[1:29:33] i've appeared unto thee for a purpose
[1:29:38] to make thee a minister and a witness
[1:29:42] of both of these saints which thou has
[1:29:43] seen of those things which
[1:29:46] i will appear unto thee
[1:29:50] and i'm going to deliver you from the
[1:29:52] people
[1:29:55] some of you need to be delivered from
[1:29:57] the people around you
[1:30:03] hang around the wrong crowd
[1:30:08] i'm going to deliver i've appeared to
[1:30:10] you
[1:30:11] for a purpose
[1:30:17] verse 18 says and to open their eyes
[1:30:23] turn them from the darkness to light
[1:30:27] from the power
[1:30:29] of satan
[1:30:31] to the power of god amen
[1:30:35] wow
[1:30:38] you mean to tell me
[1:30:41] that satan has a power
[1:30:44] and he can hold people and he can
[1:30:45] enslave people
[1:30:47] absolutely
[1:30:49] but i have a god who is a deliverer
[1:30:58] he's able to deliver you
[1:31:01] that's why i've appeared to you to
[1:31:04] you to be a minister
[1:31:07] i want you to go preach the gospel to
[1:31:09] these guys
[1:31:10] i want you to open their eyes now
[1:31:11] realize i as a minister i can't open
[1:31:13] your
[1:31:14] eyes but if you're there
[1:31:18] and you're sensitized to the holy spirit
[1:31:20] and i say something
[1:31:23] and it's the holy spirit using me
[1:31:26] guess what
[1:31:27] i got it
[1:31:29] i got it
[1:31:34] and appearing is actually a revealing or
[1:31:37] an unveiling
[1:31:41] whenever god appears he reveals
[1:31:43] something
[1:31:46] if god ever comes and speaks to you he's
[1:31:49] appearing to you he's bringing to you
[1:31:51] revelation and understanding
[1:31:54] and i wonder how many
[1:31:57] religious message believers today
[1:32:00] who need to get converted
[1:32:04] they've just been raised up in it
[1:32:06] they've been around it they may look
[1:32:08] good on the outside but what about the
[1:32:11] inside
[1:32:12] brother ram said like that pastor is
[1:32:14] saying hey my my wife she's a she's a
[1:32:17] saint
[1:32:19] they said he looked at her with her
[1:32:21] hair doing a manicure and all of this
[1:32:23] stuff and he said looks like to me she's
[1:32:26] a hain
[1:32:28] she ain't got it
[1:32:30] come up there and put her hand up there
[1:32:34] he says
[1:32:35] hi how do you do
[1:32:37] i'd like to you know he said well bring
[1:32:39] it down here so i can shake it
[1:32:43] i
[1:32:43] do you know what is the most
[1:32:47] appealing thing to this message to me
[1:32:51] it didn't have all the fluff and frill
[1:32:54] of pentecost
[1:32:56] and of hollywood evangelism it was real
[1:33:00] it was real
[1:33:03] and i've always said god don't give me
[1:33:05] something counterfeit give me something
[1:33:08] real
[1:33:14] like that young boy i've told you the
[1:33:16] testimony and i'm going to say this in
[1:33:18] close
[1:33:19] that young boy in germany had been
[1:33:21] raised in the message around a message
[1:33:23] family and just
[1:33:25] got to hanging around the wrong crowd
[1:33:27] smoking drinking
[1:33:29] and he was the roughest carouser in the
[1:33:31] group
[1:33:32] all the young people knew him
[1:33:37] he was the elder of the
[1:33:39] one that's having the youth meeting
[1:33:42] sometimes the roughest kids
[1:33:48] they're associated with some of the
[1:33:50] elders the pastor
[1:33:52] huh deacon
[1:33:54] yeah because the devil wants to take
[1:33:56] your kids
[1:33:59] and take them down
[1:34:02] i preached and a young boy came to the
[1:34:05] church service actually in a in a big
[1:34:07] old home a farmhouse
[1:34:12] and we we were there we preached the day
[1:34:14] before and
[1:34:15] holy spirit moved in a powerful way and
[1:34:18] i have a translator with me and
[1:34:21] it was a good service and everything but
[1:34:23] you know what this young man said
[1:34:27] he was touched in his heart and he said
[1:34:30] i need to know if this is really true
[1:34:35] and he went up into the hayloft above
[1:34:37] the barn where they'd take the hay and
[1:34:39] throw it down to the cows and you know
[1:34:43] and he walked
[1:34:44] in the hay loft all night
[1:34:47] and ben you know what he was saying
[1:34:49] i got to know is this real
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:52] you know
[1:34:54] i don't want to serve something that's
[1:34:56] phony i need to know
[1:34:58] it's real
[1:34:59] i don't want to believe it because my
[1:35:01] mom and dad believe it i don't want to
[1:35:02] believe it because
[1:35:04] i'm caught up in something else i need
[1:35:06] to know for myself so i need you to give
[1:35:09] me a sign
[1:35:10] [Music]
[1:35:11] i need you to give me a sign lord he's
[1:35:14] walking up and down up there in the loft
[1:35:17] of the barn i need you to give me a sign
[1:35:21] because i want something real
[1:35:25] god gives me a vision
[1:35:27] there's been a few times in my life
[1:35:29] god's given me visions
[1:35:32] i had a vision and this
[1:35:34] this farmhouse was so packed
[1:35:37] that i'm no more than this far away from
[1:35:40] those that are sitting right in front of
[1:35:41] me
[1:35:44] and in this vision i
[1:35:46] i see all the young people i see three
[1:35:49] young girls sitting right here to my
[1:35:50] front
[1:35:54] and what's empowering and i'll tell you
[1:35:56] what brother david when you have a
[1:35:58] vision and you step into the vision it
[1:36:00] gives you power
[1:36:03] yeah
[1:36:04] you walk into it this is what i saw i
[1:36:06] told my wife
[1:36:07] i said sandy he had a vision i saw me
[1:36:10] preaching i knew what i was preaching
[1:36:14] but i don't know when it's gonna happen
[1:36:16] i can't make it happen that morning
[1:36:19] guess what we step right into the vision
[1:36:21] here i am
[1:36:22] wow here's some young girls
[1:36:28] and there was somebody a young man in
[1:36:29] the back
[1:36:31] but about where you're at justin
[1:36:36] and holy spirit told me to tell that
[1:36:38] young man i don't know him
[1:36:41] i don't know who he is
[1:36:44] i don't know where he comes from i don't
[1:36:46] know if he goes to church or what about
[1:36:48] him
[1:36:50] i said stand up and say you love the
[1:36:52] lord
[1:36:54] and these three young girls who are this
[1:36:56] close to me
[1:36:57] you know what they did they turned
[1:36:58] around look who's he talking about
[1:37:01] so they turned around to look
[1:37:04] and this young man stands up and they
[1:37:06] started laughing because this is the
[1:37:08] roughest kid in the group
[1:37:12] i'm embarrassed for you preacher
[1:37:17] stand up and say you love the lord
[1:37:20] you blew it preacher this guy you don't
[1:37:23] know him
[1:37:24] smoking drinking
[1:37:28] making fun of god
[1:37:31] all of a sudden this young man and he
[1:37:33] broke
[1:37:35] he's speaking in german
[1:37:38] he's saying
[1:37:39] yesterday during the service that i was
[1:37:41] moved but i want to know
[1:37:43] is it real
[1:37:45] and if it's real i'm going to ask you
[1:37:47] god to do something really special for
[1:37:50] me
[1:37:52] i'm going to have you ask brother ron
[1:37:54] to have me to stand up and say that i
[1:37:57] love the lord
[1:38:03] that's a
[1:38:04] supernatural god
[1:38:09] and i believe that we'll see more and
[1:38:11] more of this
[1:38:13] the only thing is we don't sit there and
[1:38:15] try to
[1:38:18] does that make me anything no
[1:38:21] just a servant
[1:38:24] just a servant
[1:38:26] and now that young man
[1:38:28] loves the lord
[1:38:30] serving the lord doing what's right
[1:38:33] i had an opportunity there
[1:38:36] in that farmhouse to witness
[1:38:40] one of the greatest opportunities i've
[1:38:42] ever seen
[1:38:45] of the
[1:38:46] falling like it was on the day of
[1:38:48] pentecost
[1:38:52] only the only thing that i did was
[1:38:54] different
[1:38:56] i told him i don't want you to play no
[1:38:58] music
[1:39:00] now you guys keep playing i want you to
[1:39:02] keep playing
[1:39:04] but i told him i said don't don't
[1:39:06] get to the music god don't need your
[1:39:08] help
[1:39:11] i said because on the day of pentecost
[1:39:13] they were just sitting
[1:39:16] and a rushing mighty wind fell upon them
[1:39:19] and cloven tongues
[1:39:21] sat upon each one of them and then guess
[1:39:23] what
[1:39:25] huh
[1:39:28] and i saw the holy spirit move in such a
[1:39:31] powerful way
[1:39:32] and the parents because i told the
[1:39:34] parents you can't take any of the chairs
[1:39:35] here in this part of the house you have
[1:39:37] to sit that would be where the fourier's
[1:39:40] at now appearance there because germans
[1:39:42] and you have to understand german ways
[1:39:45] huh
[1:39:47] al is invested in deutschland
[1:39:50] fear haben alice
[1:39:53] kind of an arrogant huh
[1:39:55] that i'm talking about
[1:39:58] not converted germans
[1:40:01] just german huh
[1:40:02] allah
[1:40:14] why do we have an american guy come over
[1:40:16] here preach to our kids can't our german
[1:40:18] men do it
[1:40:20] so there's
[1:40:21] like this
[1:40:24] until the holy spirit begins to move
[1:40:27] now
[1:40:29] you can criticize all you want
[1:40:32] but you moms and dads that you've been
[1:40:35] praying for your little sis
[1:40:37] and your little son who's having a hard
[1:40:40] time that's becoming a renegade that
[1:40:43] you're wondering what's gonna and when
[1:40:45] you see him crying and shouting and your
[1:40:48] daughter was snot coming out of her nose
[1:40:51] and she's just she's just being birthed
[1:40:54] into the kingdom
[1:40:57] would that change your attitude
[1:41:00] and then it's the parents because they
[1:41:02] couldn't see so the parents got up
[1:41:06] hold me hold me
[1:41:09] the parents
[1:41:10] got up on their chairs
[1:41:14] because they know the cry of their child
[1:41:17] and when they hear the cry of their son
[1:41:18] and their daughter thank you
[1:41:22] all of a sudden what do you think they
[1:41:23] did
[1:41:25] we're having we're just having us a
[1:41:28] pentecost
[1:41:30] see god don't need our help just let go
[1:41:33] and let god let god do this when it's
[1:41:35] the sovereign move of god you don't have
[1:41:38] to work it up
[1:41:39] no
[1:41:41] because he can
[1:41:47] be still
[1:41:49] and know i'm god there's a sovereignty
[1:41:54] about god and when he comes by
[1:41:56] and the thing that i loved about brother
[1:41:58] branham
[1:42:00] it was so real
[1:42:02] and so genuine
[1:42:04] and he was saying i don't nobody moved
[1:42:08] he's here now
[1:42:10] don't even get up don't take your child
[1:42:12] out
[1:42:14] he's sovereign he's meek he's holy
[1:42:17] oh that's so different
[1:42:19] than the modern day evangelist that
[1:42:21] we're all out there on the evangelistic
[1:42:23] trail
[1:42:30] i love this message
[1:42:32] i do
[1:42:34] and i want to
[1:42:36] i want to encourage all of you
[1:42:39] i want you to pray more seek god more
[1:42:42] i want you to ask god god give me
[1:42:45] greater revelation than i've ever had
[1:42:47] before open the eyes
[1:42:50] of my heart lord
[1:42:53] and maybe parents he's opened your your
[1:42:56] eyes but what about your children
[1:42:59] what about that little one that you got
[1:43:00] sitting on your lap right now
[1:43:04] you know they're gonna grow up
[1:43:08] they're gonna hang around all of these
[1:43:11] different ones in this woke society and
[1:43:18] it's going to happen they're going to go
[1:43:19] to school
[1:43:21] they're going to run shoulders with kids
[1:43:22] that don't know if they're boy or girl
[1:43:29] there's only
[1:43:30] a group of people that know
[1:43:33] their gender identity why because it's
[1:43:36] been revealed to them through their
[1:43:37] father
[1:43:40] amen
[1:43:42] god bless you this morning
[1:43:45] it turned a little bit differently i
[1:43:47] i wanted to go a certain way but the
[1:43:49] lord just kind of changed me
[1:43:52] and that's okay
[1:43:57] you love him
[1:44:05] okay
[1:44:07] let's stand together this morning
[1:44:09] open the eyes of my heart lord

[1:44:20] i want to see

[1:47:01] at least all
[1:47:05] i'll know what to do at that time then i
[1:47:07] either accept or reject

[1:47:16] for god so loved
[1:47:18] the world
[1:47:19] that he gave his only begotten son
