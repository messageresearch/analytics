I just something said Ecclesiastes chapter 11. and verse 6. and so I was reading down because there was something in my mind that had caught I thought it was Ecclesiastes five or six and so I was reading down and uh Ecclesiastes 11 6 says in the morning so thy seed and in the evening withhold not thine hand for thou knowest not wither shall prosper either this or that or whether they both shall be alike good and brother James said but the verse above that says Thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child and I said he says brother Ron I almost chose that for my sermon tonight now imagine of all the scriptures and of everything that you could be led to go read and not very seldom and these brothers no very seldom do I I read a scripture in the back room before the service and I read that and brother James said yeah I think the verse before about the the bones growing in the womb I said what I said that is not coincidence that is actually there's a channel how many of you know that there is a channel of the holy spirit that he is working with not only here but with his bride around the world huh yes and uh for the Sons and Daughters of God that are led by the spirit they are the sons and daughters amen be led of the spirit watch those little things you will see that a lot of times what it is it's God leading you brother Warren and Carmen Hansen are here tonight God bless you snuck in on me as they always do we love them they're from up there in conditional Saskatchewan and part of the youth group that was up there and she was a great blessing and he was too she was one of the piano players and stuff but God bless you I'm glad you're here tonight God bless each and every one of you I'm glad you're all here tonight huh Church would not be Church Without You let's all stand I'm going to turn this service back over to our song leader and then we'll go and have our brother James love all Minister the word to us Amen Let the worshipers arise amen how many you've come to worship him tonight amen father I see that you are drawing a Line in the Sand I wanna be standing on your side holding your hand let your kingdom come let it live in me this is my prayer this is my plea let the worshipers arise foreign let the sons and the daughters say [Music] surrendering surrender to the queen [Music] let the worshipers arise let the sons and the daughters sing [Music] I'm surrendering my own I surrender to the king father I hear it growing louder the song of your reading as the Saints from every nation Awakening to sing from our hearts there comes an Anthem oh here the heavens ring this is our song sung to our King let the worshipers arise I let the sons and the daughters say I've surrendering my own [Music] I surrender to the king let the worshipers arise [Music] sons and the daughters say I'm surrendering my own home I surrender to the clear King praise the Lord let's just bow our heads in our hearts our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we [Music] we humble ourselves once again in your presence Lord knowing that I can study and I can seek your face but lest you come and you anoint these words and you anoint our ears Lord so we're asking what you would you come by our way for father you have an appointment with us that we're here to meet that appointment and father we want to be standing on your side Lord we want to surrender everything we are and everything we could be into your hands and we just ask now that you would just come our way and you would just have preeminence in this service Lord touch us in our bodies you see this little sickness that's trying to rise up we're just asking for a touch Lord we commit our time into your hands in Jesus precious name amen amen if you have your Bibles and turn to Ecclesiastes three Ecclesiastes 3 and his brother Ron said I was Ecclesiastes 11 and you know the they put kind of titles above that portion of scripture and it's man doesn't know the works of God you know things that we go through circumstances and stuff but yet we know who holds it but Ecclesiastes 3 and verse 1. and it says to everything there is a season a time to every purpose under heaven someone say everything so that includes you everything and Skip down to verse 11 he hath made everything beautiful in his time just to save time we're going to go to verse 14. I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God do with it that men should fear before him if we can turn over to Romans 8 Romans 8. a little lengthy reading but I feel to do so and it says and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate than he also called in whom he called he also justified in whom he justified then he also glorified what shall we say then to these things if God before us who can be against us let's get to 33 who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies Hallelujah who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who maketh intercession for us and who shall separate us from the love of God who shall separate us shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword What's it gonna take yeah is there anything that can separate us from the love of God you see these things will come right persecution will come yes yes let's skip to 37a and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am fully persuaded how many can say they're persuaded tonight that neither death nor life nor angels or principalities or powers nor things present nor things to come nor heighten or death nor any creature shall separate us from the love of God Amen you can have your seats okay nothing shall separate us from our purpose so tonight a title I'd like to take is a purpose to his appointments a purpose to his appointments and the subject would be your manifested purpose your manifested purpose you see God keeps all his appointments God doesn't do anything by coincidence he doesn't do things haphazardly he doesn't do things halfway but everything that God does he does for a purpose and a reason you see whether it's going through a valley or trial or you're up on the Mountaintop no matter what circumstance you're going through and even as brother Ron said Ecclesiastes 11 man doesn't know what God has for us man doesn't know the plans of God right man doesn't know the way the bones in the belly that that the bones grow in the womb God doesn't know or man doesn't know what God has for us he doesn't know right right but yet there's a purpose to everything to everything there's a season and a Time in the good times and the bad times God will fulfill his purpose brother Branham says the unwelcome Christ Jesus is here tonight Jesus keeps his appointments no matter how you are where you are he kept his PO appointment with Jonah in the belly of the well he kept his appointment with Daniel in the lions den he kept his appointment with the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace praise God he kept his appointment with me on my deathbed he said he's here tonight wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in the midst Jesus keeps all his appointments always and I love how he says this this next portion I kind of the Simplicity that he brings it he says God may have left Glory maybe just a little early tonight to get here on time because God keeps his appointments you see he might have left Glory he might have checked his GPS and he might have seen that there was traffic maybe there was a little bit of weather but yet God left Glory tonight because he had an appointment with each one of us but yet you have to be ready to catch that appointment to recognize that appointment Through the Bible time and time again we see that each character at some point in their life will have an appointment they'll come against a crossroad and they'll have an appointment with God and you see God he uses people in the Bible that I love whenever you read it that it's people it's just ordinary people like you and I they're not some superheroes or they're not Giants why because God wants to show you in his word what's attainable mom you see God uses Ordinary People in in extraordinary ways you take the woman at the well he sent his disciples in because he had an appointment he said I'm going to tarry here because there was somebody that was to come by that way and she was to come and she would begin to talk to this man she didn't know who she he was thank you can he began to talk and it's not customary for you to talk to me and these different things but yet if she knew who he was and as she began to talk he began to listen and he began to discerner and she said we know that a messiah must come and he would say these things what was it she had an appointment with almighty God you see the washer woman she had an appointment with God Jesus sat in the room with religious men with Pharisees men who knew the Bible men who knew he was but yet there was a woman she didn't know why she would go and sell all she would get the very best ointment why because she had an appointment there was something inside of her there was a deep inside of her that knew that I had to get to this spot she didn't know why but God did because he had an appointment with her just using a few examples and Jacob you see Jacob came to a point in his life where he wrestled with God yeah you see each one of us have to do the same correct you young men you're gonna have to wrestle with God you're gonna have to come to a point in your life that you wrestle with God you say well how do I know I changed yeah because he walked differently calling the limping Prophet why because after that he had a different walk to him he had a different step to him you see when you meet God you'll begin to talk and act different the worst sinner in the city in 60 56 he said he always keeps his appointments and I love him for that he keeps his appointments that's the reason tonight I got confidence in him he keeps his appointments Hallelujah he never fails he won't never fail and remember man and woman boy and girl you got an appointment with him too yes with him you're going to either meet him in peace here you're going to meet him at the judgment but you're going to keep that appointment that's one thing you're going to do I say God I want to meet him here amen you see we can I'm just building a foundation of having an appointment with God each one of us can say that I've had or at some point come across where God had an appointment with me where he met me you know we all don't have to come a certain way right some come through denomination you know God isn't a respecter of person you know some God can use somebody out there to say something to you and get you to follow get you in in line you know as we use you know denominations in this message or whatever you know he might use somebody that just doesn't believe it if we said like um return Ministry but yet God might use that man at some point in your life to say something to get you to come to the prophet yeah he might not believe it all right you understand but yet God might use him to get you to a point to get you an appointment with him God might use him you see I was talking with Brother David the other day after church and he mentioned even the man that found a message book in a trash can why because he had an appointment with almighty God and you see where we're creatures of habit we revert back to things that we know I'm sure some of us I might raise my hand might have made the same New Year's resolutions as you did last year you might have said this year is the year I'm going to stay in the gym this year I'm going to stay on a diet you see why because we're creatures of habit and if we don't make reading our Bibles and praying and getting into this message a habit what do we do we fall back to things that are easy things that satisfy us growing up dad used to tell us you do things for 21 straight days you may get a habit you see because when hard times come you begin to fall back to the things that your customers are doing but yet if you make this Bible and you make reading and praying and what happens when the hard times come you begin to get on your knees and you begin to seek God sure so Ram says what it takes to overcome all in belief he says now there is a time that a man can come to a place where he can have a purpose this is where I'm going there's a time that a man can have a place where he can have a purpose it's something that will change him and that is when a man meets God a man can never be the same when he meets God face to face it will change him in spite of anything you can do about it a man can never be the same after he wants meets God now that's the truth you see when you meet God face to face when you wrestle with that angel you're going to walk different you're going to talk different I was listening to a sermon the other day third 65 . it's a beautiful sermon I suggest you go back and listen to it but he talks about you're identified by the things you thirst after you're identified by the things you thirst after what do you thirsting after now you think carnally yeah you might thirst after he talks about fashion and being able to fit in and thirsting after the things of the world but yet he also brings the balance of thirsting after spiritual things he says there's a need to thirst after spiritual things he says if you thirst after God God will meet you but he says thirsting after God he said when you thirst after God going to church won't satisfy that come on he said thirsting out thirsty after God just meeting just or going to listen to One preacher won't satisfy that he says thirsty after God emotions and Sensations go back and listen he says those things won't satisfy it he says the only thing that will satisfy a thirst for God is meeting him face to face is when you come to a point in your life that you're thirsty and you're hungry and you say God I need more of you God I want more of you the only thing that will satisfy is meeting him face to face you see we all have a purpose and a man who knows who he is and where he is he knows his purpose naturally we have a purpose when I got married my purpose was to be a husband to my wife but yet that purpose grew when we had our son so now it's not that I get rid of my purpose of being a husband but yet you just add to it and now I'm to be a father to my son to teach him to raise him to show him the things of God right right to be there you see and that's the same thing spiritually God's given us a purpose and the only way to find that purpose is in reading and listening to this message digging in for yourself you see so many times that we get even young people they listen to this side you know listen to this pastor or whatever it is and they just think of that that's their Revelation is what they're preached at yet it goes beyond that it's taken you to get into the message to go listen to what the prophet said to understand the full Council of God yeah you see you just can't rely on myself you can't rely on brother Ron Brother Stephen the different ministers just to preach up here and that's you you're me but the Bible says give us this day our daily bread what is that each day seeking yes finding yourself in this message digging into the word he says faith is our Victory he says there's so many people that doesn't seem to have any kind of purpose in life especially in this day that we live now live people just seem to think that all they have to do is keep up with somebody else with the Fashions of the world within the with enticements that the world has given them I'm going to skip down he says let me say this those things are all right he's talking about in the paragraph before he's talking about American ambition and wanting a a salary uh your Sal a raising salary in a new car and a house and different things he says those things are all right but he says that there's a higher ambition in the human life than those things and that Christians have set set their Reflections on the higher ambitions I think it would pay us all to sit down and wonder why we're here in the first place and ever who was kind enough to bring us here we ought to consider and ask him what we have to he had he would have for us to do the purpose of Us coming to fulfill what he has purpose for us but we seem to be just wanting to keep up with the world isn't that sad you know the sad part is is God has a purpose for us but we have to recognize that's right we'll get to it remember a purpose to his appointments and I was reading my Bible the other day and let's turn to John 9. Saint John 9. and this is kind of where I got my thought of purpose to his appointments and and Jesus was to verse 1 and Jesus was to pass by and he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind you see the custom then was if somebody had an illness or born blind or something like that a complication it was because somebody had sinned in verse 3 and Jesus said neither this man nor his parents so why was this purpose that this man was born blind but that the works of God should be manifested in him that the works of God might be manifested in him you say God by allowed this man to be born blind for this purpose absolutely why must little Theo go through his complications why do things happen to us yeah why does baby Josiah lay in a hospital bed but yet when we begin to understand that there's a purpose in it yeah and I believe that what that little young man is gonna fulfill his purpose yeah he said brother James what is it I don't know but I know that there's a purpose for it why because God does things in his word and when you begin to see things in his Bible he does things the same way in our day but yet he allowed this to happen yes that the purpose might be made manifest through him and let's skip to verse 5. and I love this and he says as long as I'm in the world I am the light of the world and that kind of got me excited because when you read that that should be you yeah as long as I'm in the world I am the light of the world as long as I'm here come on I am the light as long as I'm here I'm peace as long as I'm here I'm joy as long as here I'm Grace as long as I'm here you see I'm very Christ I'm that same light that shining to the world today [Music] when you begin to see it that I am the light of the world and as long as I'm here I have a purpose you see the Bible says in Matthew 5 and 14 ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill which cannot be hid neither do men like candles and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick it is given a light unto all that are in the house let your light shine so before men that they may see your good works that they may see your good works not to glorify yourself it's not for you but it's to glorify your father you see I had a customer a couple weeks ago I was doing some business and we got done and we began to talk and he has a 16 year old boy who needed surgery I don't know the medical terms but he has a sunken in chest he's 16 years old the older he gets it it causes pressure on the internal organs and so they you know with the heart and the lungs so what they do is they go in and they put a rod they lift the chest and hold it in place very painful and I was doing you know we were just talking and he said James I want you to come pray for my son and I said yeah yeah no problem you know yeah I can do that foreign and you know we left and I said yeah no problem and we left then I got driving down the road and it kind of struck me because he says I want you to go pray for my son but yet he wasn't asking me but he was asking the God in Me saying that I know something's different about you he knows what I believe but yet when they can recognize the god that's in you and their faith Rises up to say would you go pray for my son because I was driving down the road and I remembered it came to my memory of the man and his daughter was dying and it was the faith of the father that said go get Jesus sometimes you gotta go get Jesus you see they're asking go get them so what is it yeah the faith of that father for his boy amen so isn't I after one of our pickups we went and went to his house and we prayed for him and it was a very special time but yet let me ask you are you fulfilling your purpose does the world around you recognize why you're here it's not to glorify me right but yet is to glorify the god in you that everywhere you go you can say hey this is my purpose you talk about God you Fellowship you tell them who you are yeah yeah and then when there's a need they want to call you and say hey can you pray for me you see the world out there they recognize God in the need for prayer but they only recognize him in a time of need when there's a catastrophe when something major happens you see the other week and we all I'm sure we all know but there was that football player that got just an ordinary play NFL ordinary tackle gets hit in the chest stands up Falls over he dies right there they had to resuscitate him CPR for nine minutes on the field he's died twice but the reason I'm saying this is because after that happened nobody knew what to say but you know what they said let's pray everybody pray hey we need everybody to pray everybody on TV and everywhere hey we need to pray you pray for him and I believe that a hundred percent but yet why does it take that to call God on the scene you see even the next day they had a one of the ESPN guys he bowed his head and prayed right there on set he said hey everybody let's just pray I respect that man be it you know what would have happened if it was another day if that incident wasn't there he'd have been fired how does this make sense yeah and I say Lord help us you know just to be more sensitive that when somebody reaches out that we're not ashamed not afraid because you know what happens when somebody asks you for prayer a lot of times am I worthy enough to pray for this man what what happens if I go down and I pray for him and nothing happens and I'll you know what that's the Devil he's trying to suppress your faith and if he can suppress your faith and keep you down here they can keep you from believing in who you are and that if you say a prayer that God might answer it you see many times people will text take will you pray for me will you pray for me and I'm guilty of it what happens you get busy you forget yeah see what I've learned to do stop everything and pray because when you look at from a different purpose what if it's your per what if it's your prayer what if it's your prayer that answers theirs when you look at it from that your prayer might make the difference and I begin to continue to read about the blind man in verse 6. that when Jesus healed them I thought this was interesting and we when he had spaked this he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed his eyes the eyes of the blind man and I thought this was interesting because the purpose of this man to be born blind was that God might be made manifest now he's gone so why didn't he just pray for the man and say young man I give you back your sight but yet he anointed his eyes and he told him something he had to do he had to put his faith into action listen in verse 7 he said unto him go wash in the pool of Salam and he went that way and washed and came away seeing you see and it hit me that God did the anointing of the eyes but you have to do the washing here you are walking in loud to see it with blinded eyes not knowing where you're going and who you are but yet God came by he had an appointment with him that day and he anointed your eyes why do you come to church you're Washed by the Water of the worm but yet God it took that man to take God at his word he had a part to do you see if that man never went to the pool God's purpose wouldn't have been made known right because God did the anointing but the man had to do the washing he had to put that into action you see God doesn't do everything as we expect he doesn't do everything for you sometimes you have to go wash you have to put it into action he'll give you a purpose and that purpose puts you into action if we can go to Second Kings 2 ND Kings two and five I'll just start no so naming came to his horses and with his chariots and stood at the door of the House of Elisha and Elisha sent the messenger unto him saying go and wash in the Jordan seven times that thy flesh should come again to thee that thou should be clean and listen what Naaman did but Naaman was rough and went away and said behold I thought this is what I thought this is how I thought it should have happened I thought that the prophet would do this yeah I thought he was surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord and his his God his strike with his hand over the place and recover the leper you see but God don't do things as we thought in verse 12 are not abana sorry in Far part of the rivers of Damascus better than all the Waters of Israel may I not wash in them and be made clean so he turned away and went away in Rage isn't that something he had an appointment there his healing lied right there but I thought yeah I thought you see the prophet of that day sent to Messenger to tell them exactly what the Met what the prophet said what are we doing tonight I'm just a messenger telling you what the prophet said to get your healing to get your deliverance but sometimes it's I thought it should have gone this way but thank God for his servant and his servant came near and spake unto him and said my father if the prophet had bid thee to do some great thing what if thou have done it how much rather than when he saith unto thee wash and be made clean sometimes it's too simple yeah yeah you see because that's just our Humanity we want to do some great big thing I'll go kill a giant go go do some great thing in front of the people so that they can be why because it begins to lift yourself up it takes away the glory of God but yet he sends you to do something so simple something so humble he makes you humble yourself aren't these Waters over here cleaner than that money Jordan but yet it's not what you thought it's what God told you to do then he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan according to the saying of the man of God and his flesh came again unto like flesh of a little child and he was clean you see sometimes your appointment isn't what you want to hear sometimes your appointment is something you need to hear but God keeps all his appointments you see and there's a purpose to every point I'm reminded of the story of Saul on the road to Damascus we know it but yeah he we know that he had an appointment with God there and I just want to read verse 16. because the Saul was headed in One Direction God had an appointment to change it God had an appointment to meet him in verse 16 says but arise and stand upon thy feet for I have appeared unto you to thee for this purpose to make the a minister and a witness both to these things which thou has seen and of those things which I will appear unto thee Verse 18 to open their eyes and to turn them from Darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sin and inheritance among them which are Sanctified by the faith it is in me you see Saul was going in One Direction but God had an appointment with him see when God gives you when God has an appointment with you he gives you a purpose you see Mary in the Bible God had an appointment with her and according to her own understanding according to her own reasoning I know not a man how is this thing supposed to be but yet when God gives you a purpose he has a provided way to fulfill that purpose you see he won't leave you out there he imagine a young lady coming not married and saying I'm with child what would we think of her today would we doubt her maybe a little bit especially when she says oh it's from no man but from God you see but she took God at her his word she took God in his word your dependence on God's is what makes him God your dependence on him makes him Jehovah Jireh we can take Sarah you see Sarah had an appointment with God in the tent but she laughed because upon her own reasoning her own understanding she's like how I am a full age these things can't be but yet it's not our own understanding it's not our own reasoning but yet there was coming a Time that she would receive that word and she would conceive a son because God had that purpose that plan for her last example that I have is Esther you see Esther was to have an appointment with the King and when you put yourself in the story of Esther you have an appointment with almighty God and you have to go before the king but yet there's a process and all the women all the mains had to go through a purification process you just couldn't come off the street and go before the king so there was a process that you must go through but yet she had an appointment with that King you see and she was given a hair guy The Keeper of the women he found favor in her and you see that when she found favor in him haggai told her everything that the king liked everything that he wanted the way she should be dressed because all the other women they wanted all to find jewelry all the fine linen all the things that please are naturally but yet there was something deeper and she says that if I Adorn myself and what haggai has said because haggai knew what the king wanted he knew what he required he knew what he liked and if he came that provided way he knew that she would find favor yeah but yet there was a purpose Esther's purpose to be Queen wasn't just to be a queen she wasn't just there to be in position but yet she was there for a purpose and that purpose was for the saving of her people you see sometimes God puts you in a position for a purpose and when God puts you in a position there's a reason yeah and you have to find that reason you have to put it into action the sermonian churches he says now according to the word of God the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world this choosing of a bride was purpose in himself Ephesians 1 and 9 and Romans 9 11 says that the purpose of God according to election might stand you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world you see just as Esther was ordained and she was purposed to be Queen so are you before the foundation of the world before God formed the Earth he had called you and that purposely dormant for so long that purpose lay dormant until it came to you but now you have to fulfill it in the sardian church age he says it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like him to himself that would be a word Brian she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was four known and beloved before she had ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and can never be can come into condemnation she can never be in judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her you never never did it in the first place you see you're choosing an election your call is for a purpose and it was called before the foundation of the world you see you're just living it out you see you're just going down through life and all of a sudden God come by your way and something struck a seed something came to life you see it's time to fulfill his purpose in you we as a body aren't complete until you fulfill your purpose and get into position I begin to think purpose of a Christian now the Bible says to visit the widows and the fatherless to be Christ to those around you and it just kind of came to me purpose the Bible says walk a mile in your brother's shoes go with them too what if you put yourself in the shoes of somebody fighting cancer what about the backward kid at school that always gets voted last and never gets picked for the team put your shoes in them young person that's trying to find their identity yeah put yourself in the shoes of a father and mother praying for their wayward child put yourself in the shoes of a family member who's maybe lost a loved one put your shoes in the Widow who's goes who goes home to an empty home at night you see whenever you begin to see these things purpose what is purpose are you reaching out to those that are hurting you see when one hurts the whole body hurts how about we be that we reach out that we be Christ to those around us yes yes you see because when you put yourself in their shoes and you begin to walk you begin to feel their pain you begin to feel their hurt what if it was you what if it was your son what if it was your daughter your father your mother you see we begin to pray a little bit different we begin to call on God a little bit different we get a little bit more Earnest when it falls in our lap yeah but the thing about it is when you found your purpose in Christ where one body we all feel the hurt we all feel the pain so I pray let let us reach out to one another God has an appointment with each one of us time and time again you'll read in the scripture for this purpose you were born yeah and for this purpose I've called you let's stand brother Branham says I know my redeemer liveth since God's purpose can never be defeated there's nothing can defeat it so happy we ought to be today resting upon the beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there is neither nothing present nor things to come there's no sickness no sorrow no death no Peril no no nothing can separate us from the purpose of the Living God what God has imagined in his mind God has purpose in his heart to bring it to pass there's no demon no power there's nothing can separate us from God's Great Immortal Eternal plan it must be as God has said can you say Amen God's purpose can't be defeated Satan tried to defeat it in the days of Jonah [Music] all down through time you'll see where Satan trying to defeat that purpose but that plan is eternal that love is elective you were called your purpose was predestinated you were foreknown you see God didn't just call you to be a church member you can do that in denomination you can come to church [Music] you can come and sit on a pew but yet God's calling us to a higher purpose see God is only going to reveal his word and that purpose through an elect lady we are the hands and feet of today come on just yes I trust each one of us will find our purpose yes [Music] yes because I can't give it to you brother Ron can't give it to you but yet it comes down to you and when that purpose is made known to you nobody can take it away foreign [Music] all things coming down what's happening but yet sometimes you got to get to Rock Bottom because then the only place to go is up yeah I can say that from personal experience that I found gone at a place I didn't know which way to go but yet he had an appointment with me and I can say that it wasn't in a church service so we look for it there be it sometimes God will meet you in a place maybe it's a bedroom a closet out in the woods sometimes you gotta [Music] put God's word into action sometimes we got to get alone [Music] that's just bow our hoods our gracious Heavenly Father Lord before the foundation of the world you formed us you knew us you have called us to be the elect Lady of this day and when we begin to recognize who we are in the positions that we have Lord the power that lays within us sometimes we doubt ourselves sometimes we don't understand but yet there's a purpose there God knows how great he is be it sometimes God wants you to realize how great you are through him father I can remember the time that I would pray and seek your face and call out to you and Lord I knew you wouldn't give up on me if I'm a son if you were a son you always will be a son and I knew you wouldn't give up on me but Lord I would pray God don't let me give up on myself let me see who I am let me let me know you in the power of your word reveal yourself to me give me a purpose give me an understanding give me a revelation I don't want my dad's religion or my grandpa's religion or brother Ron's but I want my own religion and when I came to that place I found a purpose each one of us got to come to that place that understanding that Revelation that that purpose lays with inside you and when God has an appointment with you it'll be May manifest through you and so father we just thank you for this time that you've given us to come to your house to sit at your feet Lord and I pray that just something would have been said maybe it's a little cut up and put together and sometimes you feel you're inadequate Lord too speak to your elect lady for Lord You're preparing us to meet the king and Lord circumstances and things we go through just like the blind man when you begin to understand it from that perspective Lord we begin to see that you have a purpose your hand is in it I pray you touch the needs of your people Lord continue to be with little Theo and little Josiah may your word Lord Jesus May our faith rise Lord may your purpose be made known or may you send a breath of life into Josiah's foreign Lord we thank
