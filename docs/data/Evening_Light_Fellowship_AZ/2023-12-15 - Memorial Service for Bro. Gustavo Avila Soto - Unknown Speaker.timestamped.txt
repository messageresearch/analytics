[8:40] voice those that have been
[8:43] redeemed and it's not there's not too
[8:46] much time

[8:50] have left is to get
[8:53] ready God is giving us the
[8:57] opportunity to align our lives with
[9:04] God and this morning they gave me the
[9:06] privilege to speak for 15
[9:08] minutes I give thanks unto my
[9:11] sister for giving me this
[9:15] opportunity it's a privilege to be
[9:17] behind this
[9:21] Pulpit we give thanks to our brother Ron
[9:23] Peterson for the
[9:25] opportunity and to the local
[9:28] Ministry and the trust to be behind this
[9:31] pulit I don't take it
[9:34] lightly but with all due
[9:37] respect from here Words of Life come
[9:43] out and being here brings a lot of
[9:49] memories this place for me is very
[9:56] special we're here to speak a little bit
[9:58] about our brother gust
[10:00] [Music]
[10:01] my
[10:07] brother-in-law I can say a lot speak a
[10:09] lot but it's not about saying or
[10:11] speaking a
[10:13] lot yeah now it's 10
[10:18] minutes but we're very thankful with the
[10:20] opportunity they have given
[10:23] us we're seeing friends family
[10:26] members these moments
[10:29] it's a little
[10:32] difficult but within our hearts there's
[10:34] a
[10:36] joy there's a joy in which you cannot
[10:39] explain
[10:41] it our brother Gustavo is ahead of us
[10:50] now for me brother my brother was an
[10:58] example
[11:00] in reality there's many several examples
[11:02] around us there's not going to be any
[11:07] excuse that we don't make it
[11:13] there God is giving us the opportunity
[11:15] God be in
[11:17] flesh he's in
[11:19] deity of human of human
[11:22] flesh we see around
[11:26] us and my brother here was a war
[11:29] he is a
[11:32] warrior the sons of God do not
[11:35] die they are at rest how many believe
[11:39] that so we do not
[11:42] die those that are in Christ shall not
[11:46] die we're just being
[11:49] changed what does death
[11:52] do and my short understanding of
[11:57] it
[12:00] like an Uber comes for
[12:02] me it's going to take me to my
[12:08] destination so that's what death does
[12:10] for
[12:13] us these moments we
[12:17] are we're celebrating the life of our
[12:19] brother
[12:23] Gust in the human side or aspect of it
[12:26] we are sad
[12:27] yes
[12:29] and yes it's okay to be
[12:32] sad because it is a
[12:37] separation but within our hearts we know
[12:39] it's not for a lot of
[12:41] time we have been
[12:45] taught we have a little bit of
[12:51] time and I remember when brother brand
[12:53] said when he he passed the curtain of
[12:56] time he heard that voice keep pressing
[12:58] on
[13:00] keep pressing
[13:03] on and in this
[13:05] morning I could say let's keep pressing
[13:09] on Don't Look
[13:12] Back look
[13:14] forward and it's not too
[13:17] far but uh we need to encourage each
[13:23] other not looking our
[13:27] mistakes failers
[13:31] but we can see it through
[13:36] Grace because we're all going to be
[13:38] saved by
[13:39] gra through our Lord Jesus Christ that's
[13:42] where the key is at that's where the key
[13:44] is at if we need forgiveness we need
[13:48] Deliverance it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[13:51] he already paid the price it's already
[13:53] been
[13:55] paid we cannot pay it because he already
[14:05] amen I'm going to tell you a short uh
[14:08] story that my brother-in-law here loved
[14:09] a lot and with this I'm going to
[14:14] close because time is at
[14:17] hand every time I tell him this story he
[14:21] would like to listen to the
[14:24] story the human
[14:26] being we always have questions
[14:30] what is the strongest thing in
[14:33] life so they went to go
[14:39] ask than you
[14:44] okay they went and asked iron iron are
[14:47] you the strongest
[14:49] thing and iron said
[14:52] no it's the
[14:55] fire because they put me in the fire and
[14:57] they they melt me they softened me
[15:01] up so they ran to the
[15:04] fire and they asked the fire fire are
[15:07] you the
[15:08] strongest and the fire said no I am not
[15:11] it's the
[15:13] water because they throw water at me and
[15:16] they turn me
[15:17] off so they went to the
[15:20] water and they said
[15:22] water are you the strongest he said no
[15:27] it's the Sun
[15:34] because the sun heats me up and I
[15:36] evaporate it evaporates
[15:39] me so they went to the
[15:43] sun son are you the strongest thing that
[15:47] exists and he says
[15:49] no it's the
[15:51] clouds how is it the
[15:55] clouds because the clouds get under me
[15:57] and they take away my
[16:01] heat so they went and asked the
[16:05] clouds clouds are you the strongest
[16:07] thing that lives on
[16:09] Earth they said
[16:11] no it's the
[16:15] mountains because we go through the
[16:17] mountains and they separate
[16:20] us so they went to the mountains and
[16:22] they ask the
[16:27] mountains and they asked mountains are
[16:29] you the strongest thing that exists in
[16:33] life the mountains said no it's man wow
[16:42] wow so man was marveled
[16:45] with the same man himself
[16:48] said and he said man are you the
[16:51] strongest he said
[16:53] no it's
[16:55] death wow my
[16:59] so they went to
[17:01] death and death was on his
[17:06] throne and they said
[17:09] death are you the strongest that
[17:13] exists and death sitting on its
[17:17] Throne sadly he bowed his
[17:22] head I once was the strongest thing that
[17:27] existed
[17:31] until a
[17:34] man the third day
[17:38] resurrected and that is the Lord Jesus
[17:41] Christ that is the
[17:45] strongest that will keep us keep us
[17:49] up strong keep us
[17:52] strong that's the the story and my
[17:55] daughter can come

[1:11:57] I can
[1:12:03] understand that it pleased God
[1:12:07] Amen one
[1:12:12] day to shed or pour out everything that
[1:12:15] was in
[1:12:18] him pour it out all in a man named Jesus
[1:12:21] the
[1:12:22] Christ
[1:12:25] he was the fullness of the
[1:12:28] Lord there the deity
[1:12:34] dwelt but all that was in
[1:12:39] Jesus he died on the cross on
[1:12:42] Calvary he poured it
[1:12:45] out he split
[1:12:47] himself
[1:12:50] himself and he poured himself out upon
[1:12:53] his
[1:12:57] children and one day he started to
[1:13:03] live he started to live in this man
[1:13:07] [Applause]
[1:13:09] named surely I saw my Lord in this
[1:13:13] man he not only
[1:13:18] preached but he lived what he
[1:13:20] [Music]
[1:13:22] preached a man full of
[1:13:27] God it was an example for
[1:13:31] us if we're here
[1:13:37] standing my other two brothers and I
[1:13:40] Carlos
[1:13:41] a and then Fidel
[1:13:46] a it's because of men like
[1:13:52] him
[1:13:59] that they denied
[1:14:07] themselves to be able to give life to
[1:14:09] someone
[1:14:11] else that was
[1:14:15] my he was a father to
[1:14:19] me he was my
[1:14:22] pastor
[1:14:31] loved the
[1:14:33] souls he loved the
[1:14:37] people and when I think
[1:14:43] on I think of that story that the the
[1:14:46] Bible
[1:14:50] tells about that man that had been
[1:14:52] robbed
[1:14:55] and he was on the
[1:14:58] ground then a priest passed
[1:15:03] by and he even looked towards
[1:15:07] him but he continued his
[1:15:11] path then the Levites
[1:15:16] passed saw the man on the
[1:15:19] ground and kept going his
[1:15:22] way
[1:15:25] but then a Good Samaritan
[1:15:27] came and that was my
[1:15:34] uncle he helped
[1:15:40] people like this man
[1:15:42] did he took the
[1:15:49] wounded he said cure him
[1:15:54] and I'll pay the
[1:15:56] tab that was
[1:15:59] my if you were in
[1:16:03] need it didn't matter to
[1:16:11] him to put himself
[1:16:15] aside and to give to someone
[1:16:21] else how many many times he helped
[1:16:29] me when
[1:16:32] we we're left
[1:16:36] alone my
[1:16:42] uncle he he was here in the United
[1:16:45] States we were back in
[1:16:47] Mexico with my
[1:16:52] grandmother and he would always
[1:16:55] send he would always send
[1:16:58] money send money to us for
[1:17:03] us he always helped
[1:17:05] us he was always
[1:17:08] there he was always
[1:17:11] present a
[1:17:16] man he was my
[1:17:22] idol
[1:17:24] when he would call me and he would text
[1:17:28] me and he would tell
[1:17:31] me how are you doing
[1:17:40] champ and then I would feel
[1:17:49] bad cuz I didn't
[1:17:52] deserve to be called
[1:17:58] champ CU for
[1:18:01] me my uncle
[1:18:05] Gustavo he was my
[1:18:07] champ he was a
[1:18:10] man that
[1:18:12] fought from his
[1:18:15] youth he was a man full of
[1:18:20] suffering he went the Lord sent him
[1:18:22] through that path of
[1:18:24] pain but he never
[1:18:27] complained even in his last
[1:18:30] days when he
[1:18:33] decided and he called me he said
[1:18:37] Son my last
[1:18:40] days I want to be with
[1:18:42] you I want to be in your house I want to
[1:18:46] be with you guys my

[1:19:01] days for those
[1:19:04] words for that encouragement in which
[1:19:07] you gave
[1:19:08] me because in your last
[1:19:11] days he continued being an
[1:19:14] example his his faith
[1:19:17] nevering his faith kept
[1:19:21] strong when he couldn't even raise his
[1:19:24] hands he didn't have
[1:19:27] strength he made the the most possible
[1:19:30] to lift his
[1:19:32] hands and give glory and
[1:19:36] honor the one that called him that
[1:19:40] day the one that raised them
[1:19:42] up the one that chose
[1:19:46] elect he would raise his
[1:19:49] hands and he would tell me sing a song
[1:19:54] and he loved worshiping the
[1:19:57] Lord his last
[1:19:59] days he could barely
[1:20:02] walk and he wanted to dance he wanted to
[1:20:07] jump he would say sing
[1:20:09] sing praise the
[1:20:13] Lord he was an example of a
[1:20:17] life I give thanks to God for
[1:20:21] him
[1:20:28] because God allowed
[1:20:30] me to be by his
[1:20:35] side to be able to hear His Last Breath
[1:20:39] of
[1:20:44] Life I remember
[1:20:47] when could be barely be able to open up
[1:20:50] his
[1:20:51] eyes and when he would open
[1:20:54] them he would
[1:20:57] smile and he would wink at
[1:21:03] me there was never a
[1:21:06] complaint there was never pain within
[1:21:11] him he was always
[1:21:13] thankful always
[1:21:16] happy
[1:21:18] always with
[1:21:20] him thinking of his creator
[1:21:25] I give thanks to
[1:21:27] God because I could see
[1:21:30] God
[1:21:31] walking
[1:21:35] speaking in human
[1:21:39] flesh a man like my
[1:21:42] uncle he leaves a big Legacy
[1:21:46] behind he left a big
[1:21:50] Legacy and he was the responsible one
[1:21:53] and he was the one in
[1:21:56] charge and who God sent
[1:21:59] first before
[1:22:01] us to open way to open up the
[1:22:07] path and to speak to us about that
[1:22:11] marvelous to speak to us about eternal
[1:22:14] life and he was the one that introduced
[1:22:16] to us into the
[1:22:20] gospel he is our father in the faith
[1:22:26] not only our uncle but our
[1:22:28] father I give thanks to God for
[1:22:39] him the advantage of having the making
[1:22:42] or doing the
[1:22:45] program and I put right there without
[1:22:48] limit of
[1:22:51] time
[1:22:54] I'm just
[1:22:55] kidding my uncle
[1:23:04] Gustavo i' would like to share to you
[1:23:07] what I lived with
[1:23:10] him he was always in charge of
[1:23:14] us when I got to this
[1:23:18] country it's because he was the one that
[1:23:20] brought me
[1:23:21] over
[1:23:23] and before he got
[1:23:26] married I was always with
[1:23:29] him he would always take me out to
[1:23:38] eat he was like my
[1:23:47] father I remember he took me one day to
[1:23:49] a
[1:23:51] restaurant to go eat some
[1:23:55] burritos those burritos were very
[1:23:58] good he loved them so
[1:24:02] much and we would get to that restaurant
[1:24:04] we would
[1:24:09] eat I'd have to say those burritos were
[1:24:11] this big or
[1:24:13] so so he ordered his
[1:24:16] burrito and he said one for
[1:24:19] you and we finished eating
[1:24:23] and when we
[1:24:25] finished he said you know what
[1:24:28] Mi I'm still
[1:24:31] hungry and I was
[1:24:33] surprised because that was that was
[1:24:36] a big burrito that was a tremendous
[1:24:41] burrito he ordered another
[1:24:44] burrito so he ate two
[1:24:48] burritos and I would always remind
[1:24:51] him
[1:24:53] do you remember when you eat those two
[1:24:55] burritos and he would just
[1:24:57] laugh and he said yeah I remember
[1:25:05] that how was that possible that you ate
[1:25:07] those two big old
[1:25:13] burritos I give thanks to God for my
[1:25:21] uncle
[1:25:26] I remember when I got here to the United
[1:25:27] States Mex from
[1:25:31] Mexico I didn't know of the
[1:25:36] Lord when I went into his apartment
[1:25:38] where my uncle was
[1:25:41] at I remember he grabbed the
[1:25:46] guitar and he started to sing the song
[1:25:48] God is
[1:25:51] here

[1:29:03] were smoking
[1:29:07] drinking we were still little
[1:29:10] boys and we learned from
[1:29:14] them I remember when we got the end the
[1:29:17] tip or the end of a cigarette and we
[1:29:19] would go and hide
[1:29:24] and we would start to smoke because we
[1:29:25] would see all the men were
[1:29:27] smoking they were
[1:29:29] happy they were
[1:29:32] smiling and we would imitate
[1:29:38] them unfortunately my uncle got there
[1:29:40] because uh we were in the bathroom
[1:29:44] and and we would take a puff and then we
[1:29:46] would give it to him and that's how we
[1:29:48] were and my uncle came and then and he
[1:29:52] found us smoking a
[1:29:54] cigarette unfortunately for
[1:29:57] him he took the the the punishment of my
[1:30:06] uncle I
[1:30:10] remember the
[1:30:14] brother on a
[1:30:19] motorcycle and it was easy for us toide
[1:30:28] we would see the man that rod motorcycle
[1:30:30] to give a good Ki to get it
[1:30:32] going and and then there we were revving
[1:30:35] revving the
[1:30:36] ENT and we would throw to the side fall
[1:30:40] over and we pick it
[1:30:43] up but Fidel was not there uh he was
[1:30:48] working and and and for our luck we we
[1:30:51] took off with
[1:30:52] it and we started to take off with it
[1:30:56] and we would fall we would get back up
[1:31:00] turn it back on
[1:31:03] again and we were playing around for
[1:31:06] a and then another neighbor came with
[1:31:09] his
[1:31:10] motorcycle and I was the one riding the
[1:31:12] motorcycle and I said let's go
[1:31:15] race and the neighbor was very
[1:31:18] mad because that motorcycle was his
[1:31:26] and he asked where is Fidel I want to
[1:31:28] speak to
[1:31:30] him and it went bad for my brother
[1:31:36] Gustavo I remember
[1:31:39] once he wouldn't
[1:31:44] drink and I and we went to a birthday
[1:31:46] party I was the one invited
[1:31:50] him and I told told I'm going to show
[1:31:52] you how life is
[1:31:54] lived oh I'm going to show you how you
[1:31:57] drink that's probably 18 years
[1:32:00] old and he was
[1:32:04] younger there in that party they would
[1:32:06] receive
[1:32:09] us with a shot of
[1:32:12] tequila and then they would put seven up
[1:32:14] inside of it and they would shake it
[1:32:17] up and
[1:32:19] then and would take it in one
[1:32:23] shot they call
[1:32:26] iton
[1:32:29] H and we were the
[1:32:32] party and after a couple
[1:32:38] ofon he felt like he was the best dancer
[1:32:40] of the
[1:32:42] party he was going to go take out a
[1:32:44] young lady and then another one and then
[1:32:47] another
[1:32:49] one give me give me another
[1:32:57] that young lady over there is
[1:32:59] namana Maria and that one over there is
[1:33:03] Maria and that one is
[1:33:07] Rosita and every time he would take out
[1:33:08] a young lady he would talk to
[1:33:13] her he would ask for their
[1:33:18] names he said give me another Kon
[1:33:22] I'm going to go find
[1:33:23] [Music]
[1:33:23] [Laughter]
[1:33:30] Julie H Julie was not
[1:33:34] there and there Brothers we that's how
[1:33:38] we
[1:33:39] lived I remember we would go
[1:33:43] hunting we didn't have
[1:33:47] nothing we would find the
[1:33:49] bullets uh 22
[1:33:55] caliber and after two or three little
[1:33:57] bullets we would
[1:34:00] collect we would go uh to a neighbor and
[1:34:03] we would ask to borrow his
[1:34:05] rifle and then we would
[1:34:10] go I remember
[1:34:12] once once I remember the rifle wasn't
[1:34:15] working the the the the the the Bulet
[1:34:17] was in the
[1:34:20] chamber well we broke it down we started
[1:34:22] seeing why it's not
[1:34:25] sh and then I checked through the the
[1:34:27] the
[1:34:29] barrel I didn't see
[1:34:33] nothing moving and and then boom the
[1:34:37] rifle
[1:34:40] shoots it didn't hit him nor
[1:34:42] me it could have killed us or an would
[1:34:47] have marked our our mouth or
[1:34:50] face it is
[1:34:52] but God delivered
[1:34:56] us I remember we found an iguana in a
[1:35:00] tree you can just see the head of the
[1:35:04] Iguana and we point at
[1:35:06] it or shoot
[1:35:10] nothing we put the other bullet in the
[1:35:13] chamber and G another shot and
[1:35:16] nothing the the ungrateful one wouldn't
[1:35:19] even move
[1:35:23] he would give us to PR until the last
[1:35:26] shot on the
[1:35:28] head and it comes
[1:35:33] down that was a teaching for me as a
[1:35:38] Christian when Christians don't
[1:35:41] move they're easy targets for the
[1:35:48] devil I remember when I went to with a
[1:35:50] cousin in idah to go H
[1:35:53] deer oh but to get a deer brother
[1:35:57] so
[1:35:58] all and I don't know where they just
[1:36:02] disappear and I remember of The
[1:36:03] Ungrateful
[1:36:05] iguana easy
[1:36:08] target well there are teachings that you
[1:36:11] learn and we
[1:36:15] learn brother Gustavo was a courageous
[1:36:18] man a conqueror he was a conqueror
[1:36:29] he was not scared even though he had
[1:36:31] many
[1:36:33] disadvantages he overcame many of his
[1:36:37] obstacles he had to come over here for
[1:36:41] the
[1:36:42] need and we would write to one
[1:36:45] another I I came over here because of
[1:36:49] him he would start to invite me to
[1:36:56] church and in the beginning I didn't
[1:36:58] want
[1:37:00] to
[1:37:02] thanks I got to know the Lord Jesus
[1:37:09] Christ I remember back then he would cut
[1:37:11] my
[1:37:12] hair I was his his his practice
[1:37:16] dummy I believe he already had that
[1:37:18] calling in him that Ministry that
[1:37:21] special
[1:37:22] Ministry and they would say what
[1:37:25] happened to
[1:37:26] you like cuz I kind of walk sideways I
[1:37:29] don't
[1:37:31] know but that's how we learned and then
[1:37:34] I would start to cut his hair
[1:37:36] too and well
[1:37:39] then oh life has to
[1:37:42] continue he was an inspiration he opened
[1:37:44] ways he he overcame many
[1:37:49] obstacles many many stories that we
[1:37:52] have our brother testifies I experienced
[1:37:59] it he would always share what he
[1:38:03] had it was a passion for him
[1:38:07] to and in a sense this world lost a
[1:38:10] great
[1:38:12] man but God has
[1:38:14] allowed and we need people like this
[1:38:17] with great
[1:38:19] testimonies jealous of the word of God
[1:38:25] God if this man could because he had a
[1:38:27] willing heart each and every one of us
[1:38:30] could also do
[1:38:32] it it's nice to live leave history in
[1:38:34] this
[1:38:36] world though our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:38] changed the whole world and he marked
[1:38:41] time before and after like a man not
[1:38:46] like
[1:38:50] God so have that calling that
[1:38:55] vind Brothers I come to say I have good

[1:40:09] something very
[1:40:11] beautiful for

[1:40:44] of the Tabernacle is dissolved we have a
[1:40:47] building of God and our house not made
[1:40:49] with hands eternal in the heavens for in
[1:40:52] that we grown Earnest desire to be
[1:40:54] clothed upon with our house which is
[1:40:57] from Heaven
[1:41:02] uh brother I Was
[1:41:05] preparing and this was the Revelation
[1:41:07] that God gave I didn't understand it
[1:41:09] before now I understand
[1:41:14] it and the Lord brought his people out
[1:41:16] of Israel out egpt sorry out of Egypt he
[1:41:20] brought brought him through the
[1:41:23] desert you know you know the story you
[1:41:25] know the
[1:41:28] Bible while they were in the desert for
[1:41:30] 40
[1:41:31] years a period of a
[1:41:34] generation they lived in
[1:41:37] Tabernacles they lived in
[1:41:43] tents they lived in temporary
[1:41:47] tents until God introduced them to the
[1:41:50] promised land
[1:41:52] the word of God says we
[1:41:55] know today we
[1:41:58] know that if our Earthly Dwelling
[1:42:01] Place speaking of this
[1:42:04] body we dwell in this
[1:42:07] body this is a temporary dwelling
[1:42:10] place it's a
[1:42:13] tabernacle it's a
[1:42:17] tent it's a movable
[1:42:19] tent
[1:42:22] God allowed the people of Israel in the
[1:42:25] desert put up their tents dwell in
[1:42:30] them and when the Lord would remov the
[1:42:34] cloud the people would move their tents
[1:42:37] and
[1:42:39] move and where the Lord would tell them
[1:42:41] they would Place their tents once their
[1:42:45] Tabernacle they were there for a
[1:42:48] while then the Lord would rise up again
[1:42:50] and move again and they would move their
[1:42:54] tents and then they would replace them
[1:42:56] again and time and time
[1:43:00] again that tent would would wear
[1:43:04] down until God gave him the
[1:43:07] promis your life my life is a
[1:43:12] tent that is removed and is affected day
[1:43:14] by
[1:43:16] day by the different visitations of
[1:43:20] sicknesses
[1:43:22] this tent this uh is affected as
[1:43:26] well for difficult
[1:43:29] situations we
[1:43:31] feel and it and it and
[1:43:34] it it diminishes the word of God says
[1:43:37] but we
[1:43:39] know if our our Earthly Dwelling Place
[1:43:43] this
[1:43:44] Tabernacle were
[1:43:46] dissolved would
[1:43:48] deteriorate would be lost be
[1:43:51] ripped would
[1:43:54] disappear we have a glorious
[1:43:57] hope we have a building in God in
