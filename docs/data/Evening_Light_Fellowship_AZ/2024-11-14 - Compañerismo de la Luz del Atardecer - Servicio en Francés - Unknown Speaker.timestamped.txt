[25:55] everything like that and I took three or
[25:58] four different videos well there was

[26:32] room I said there's people all through
[26:35] this
[26:36] room I did I saw them they were there
[26:38] but their faces were obscure to me so I
[26:42] knew that I wasn't crossing over
[26:44] otherwise I'd recognize him oh hey
[26:47] brother so and so brother you know shake
[26:48] their hand everything so but uh he I
[26:51] said there's there's how many know that
[26:54] we are encompassed by such a cloud of
[26:56] witnesses you're not alone hey they're
[26:59] just another
[27:00] dimension and and so it was in that
[27:04] song there and and so when I hear that I
[27:07] my mind goes back to that thank you all
[27:09] for helping out for the memorial service
[27:12] for brother Mike Patterson I would have
[27:15] liked to have been here but it just
[27:18] worked out that I I was unable to and so
[27:21] I want to thank all of the staff and the
[27:24] different ones here that work the
[27:26] deacons brother Steven and and
[27:28] everything to orchestrate it and that
[27:30] they didn't have anything uh the
[27:32] Patterson family didn't have to do
[27:34] anything just come and and and have the
[27:36] memorial service and and I want to say
[27:39] how proud I am of all of you for doing
[27:42] that and and helping them out so um
[27:46] sister Sandy and I flew to Houston as
[27:48] you all know we flew to Houston uh we
[27:51] rented a car and uh it started raining
[27:54] in Houston and rained all the way up to
[27:58] bont that's an hour and a half Drive
[28:00] hour and 40 minute drive and we got
[28:02] there and and uh you want to know why
[28:05] they have such green grass and so many
[28:07] trees huh you got to have rain you got
[28:11] to have
[28:12] moisture and
[28:15] so you want to know why everything's so
[28:18] Brown
[28:20] here and why we have cacti instead of
[28:24] trees it's because it doesn't rain that
[28:26] much we're in a different uh
[28:28] ecosystem in the area but praise the
[28:30] Lord anyway uh we spent the night there
[28:33] in Bulma the next morning we drove about
[28:36] 30 minutes north to a little city that
[28:38] we help Pastor a little group of people
[28:40] there in Silsby
[28:43] Texas and uh understand it's been 42
[28:46] years 42 years since we had done that so
[28:49] we drove around trying to find our old
[28:51] house and what you do when when if you
[28:54] haven't been somewhere in 42 years it
[28:56] changes
[28:58] okay and you go back and wow where where
[29:00] was the old lumber yard cuz we we live
[29:03] next to the lumber yard and and so
[29:05] anyway we finally asked somebody said
[29:08] well now it's over uh it used to be and
[29:11] now it's just kind of a storage area
[29:14] that's it and I said well if if I know
[29:16] where it's at I'll be able to find our
[29:18] house so we found the house that we
[29:20] lived in 42 years ago and our our kids
[29:23] didn't remember but I told them I said
[29:25] that's the the house we lived in that
[29:27] when that cop was chasing me and had his
[29:29] red lights behind me I said we outran
[29:32] him and run into the uh that's how my
[29:34] kids remember oh that
[29:37] house yeah I'm not going to tell you the
[29:39] rest of the story but he never caught me
[29:41] and and I was a bad influence I repented
[29:43] to my kids at that time but it was just
[29:46] a headlight and I knew he was going to
[29:47] try to pull me over for a headlight cuz
[29:51] I had just replace the headlight because
[29:53] back there they got gravel roads with
[29:55] and how many of you have had to replace
[29:58] a broken headline uh I mean that happens
[30:02] back there on gravel roads out here when
[30:04] was the last time he replaced the
[30:06] headline you don't do it for years
[30:08] you'll you'll buy a new car for you
[30:10] replace it anyway anyway so uh I
[30:14] repented and and my kids they they know
[30:17] better to outrun a police
[30:20] officer
[30:21] um Friday night we had dinner just to
[30:25] not take time Friday night we had dinner
[30:28] with some of the saints that we had uh
[30:31] come in contact with there and Silsby
[30:33] and been their Pastor uh 42 years ago
[30:36] and we had dinner at Bob and Camille
[30:38] Decker's home in Sour Lake and U uh then
[30:43] they had their children Robbie Lynn
[30:46] Sanders and Richard and his wife and
[30:49] some of their
[30:50] children and uh different ones and we
[30:53] just had a um a wonderful time of
[30:56] reminising
[30:58] 42 years
[30:59] ago and everything and I think what is
[31:03] amazing is it's almost like you're
[31:06] transported out of time and you walk
[31:10] back and hear where's the old school
[31:13] where's the old house where's this and

[38:46] again tonight in Jesus Christ's name we
[38:48] pray amen and amen amen so thank you
[38:51] musician God bless you all so we will go
[38:54] directly to the word of God tonight and
[38:57] I believe that this is our purpose is to
[39:00] worship and to magnify the word tonight
[39:04] so I would like to turn with me in the
[39:08] Book of Job two portion of scripture so
[39:11] in the Book of Job and we can see the
[39:14] Book of Job that is uh we conf found it
[39:17] before the book of
[39:19] Easter and uh Ezra and
[39:23] Nehemiah and we know that
[39:26] godra put scripture in chronical order
[39:30] amen so Israel nayah which is types of
[39:33] the
[39:34] restoration and the Book of Easter and
[39:36] we can see that after the restoration
[39:39] Easter was being revealed which is our
[39:41] type in this last days so
[39:44] after the revelation of Easter there
[39:47] comes the
[39:48] resurrection then the book of the new
[39:52] song so the Book of Job so this is not
[39:55] uh we can say Resurrection or Easter
[39:59] messages and we know that the
[40:01] resurrection is everyday
[40:04] Resurrection amen Book of Job chapter 19
[40:07] verse 25-
[40:13] 27 so it says for I know that my
[40:16] redeemer
[40:19] leave so it is a positive confession I
[40:24] know I'm not hoping I am not doubting
[40:27] but I
[40:30] know and that he shall stand at the
[40:33] latter day upon the Earth and though
[40:36] after my skin worm destroyed this body
[40:39] yet in my flesh I shall see
[40:42] God whom I shall see for
[40:45] myself personal
[40:48] revelation I don't care what anybody
[40:51] else
[40:52] see but is his personal revelation re
[40:56] when I see for myself and my eyes Shall
[41:00] Behold and not another though my Reigns
[41:03] be consumed within me so re means
[41:06] Eternal
[41:08] organs remember that how Lazarus body
[41:11] went into Decay prior to
[41:14] Resurrection so job here has received a
[41:17] revelation of that
[41:19] Resurrection notice that he had a
[41:23] Confident come into him in that he knew
[41:27] that he had power within him that would
[41:31] Quicken and raise his body I know my
[41:35] redeemer leave it so in the Book of
[41:37] Romans chapter
[41:44] 8 uh verse
[41:49] 11 but if the spirit of him that rais up
[41:53] Jesus from the dead dwells in you he
[41:57] that rais up Christ from the dead shall
[42:00] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[42:05] spirit that dwelleth in you and may the
[42:09] Lord add a blessing upon the reading of
[42:10] his
[42:12] word and we want to know of a certainty
[42:16] of what the even is that we have the
[42:18] same Spirit dwelling in us that raise up
[42:23] Jesus because that will also bring us
[42:25] confidence that our mortal bodies will
[42:30] be changed in this hour and put on
[42:34] immortality and the message of the hour
[42:37] made known to us that day amen so we
[42:42] will go back in the Matthew chapter 28
[42:46] the last chapter of Matthew chapter
[42:51] 28 with the
[42:54] title in your Bible the rest
[42:57] resurrection of Jesus Christ and the
[43:00] event of that
[43:02] day and we know that he is the same
[43:05] yesterday today and forever whatever
[43:07] happened then is still happening now
[43:11] because there is always a pattern so the
[43:15] title is the resurrection of Jesus
[43:17] Christ and the event on that day so we
[43:21] will start in Matthew chap 28:
[43:24] 1-2 in the end of the Sabbath it began
[43:27] to D toward the first day of the week I
[43:29] don't know if I already preached
[43:32] this but if I
[43:36] did thank you it's all
[43:40] right the scripture say verely verely I
[43:43] sayto
[43:48] you so my title tonight is the
[43:50] quickening power so we need quickening
[43:53] power
[43:55] tonight amen amen to keep us on
[43:58] fire I know the cold weather is coming
[44:00] in but we need fire amen we can we need
[44:04] quickening power in the end of the
[44:08] Sabbath as it began to D toward the
[44:11] first day of the week Came Mary
[44:13] Magdalene and the other Mary to see the
[44:16] S and we know if we can type it today
[44:19] after the Sabbath which is after the
[44:21] seventh day after the seven Church Ages
[44:23] come the first day amen which is the eth
[44:26] day which is the Eternal
[44:28] day amen and the first one that receive
[44:32] or see the resurrection was Mary
[44:34] Magdalene and
[44:38] maryd which women types the church and
[44:42] Christ has his church and church mean
[44:45] eclesia the called out one so the first
[44:48] one that recognize the resurrection are
[44:51] the C out ones so this message the 8
[44:54] message is the message that will return
[44:57] back where we came from amen so the
[45:00] message of the doesn't put us into
[45:03] another denomination but the message
[45:05] will be our point us back to where we
[45:08] came from just like Jesus Christ I came
[45:11] from God and I'll go back to God this is
[45:13] the message of the hour why the first
[45:16] one that meet or see the resurrection
[45:19] was the Church of the Living
[45:21] God denomination cannot see it but the
[45:24] bride will see it in the last days
[45:28] and behold there was a great earthquake
[45:30] for the angel of the Lord descended from
[45:33] heaven and came and roll back the Stone
[45:36] from the door and set upon him if there
[45:39] is an angel descended during the time
[45:42] and roll back the stone of the tub in
[45:44] order to reveal Christ there is a
[45:46] descending angel in our name that R back
[45:49] the seal in order to reveal
[45:52] Christ and he is no
[45:57] Christ seal is being revealed in our
[46:00] days hallelujah what a mighty Revelation
[46:04] in Hallelujah so notice the first
[46:08] thing that happened as part of the
[46:10] resurrection of Christ there was women
[46:13] an angel
[46:17] descending then the second one Jesus
[46:19] Christ
[46:21] himself
[46:23] appear then the third part there was a
[46:26] commission
[46:28] go and tell my disciples it is the same
[46:31] thing happening today the mighty angel
[46:34] came
[46:36] downage
[46:42] he then there is a commission take the
[46:45] book
[46:47] and and th must prophesy again our
[46:51] prophesying is a prophetic
[46:53] Ministry We Don't Preach about do this
[46:56] and do that do this and do that we pre
[46:58] about who we are because if you don't
[47:01] know who you are you cannot act
[47:05] according but if you know who you are
[47:07] you can act accordingly and the message
[47:09] the reveal to you who you are you are
[47:13] Sons and Daughters of
[47:16] God you need to believe it because we
[47:19] have the
[47:20] message directly addressed to each and
[47:24] every one of us
[47:27] so three things so that is in the way in
[47:30] the early days a mess churches receive
[47:32] Revelations of the
[47:34] Resurrection that's why the Revelation
[47:37] is
[47:40] Sovereign sometimes God reveal
[47:43] it and sometimes
[47:47] others later
[47:49] on so that creates a lot of
[47:53] commotion even in the
[47:55] disciples they don't believe the report
[47:58] of Mary and mag Mary and Magdalene and
[48:00] Mary they don't believe the
[48:03] report in this last day it take the Lord
[48:06] Jesus Christ himself to reveal the word
[48:10] we cannot convince one another that
[48:12] there is a message of the hour but
[48:14] unless God himself reveal it to you you
[48:17] can never understand the message of the
[48:19] hour it is the grace of God in this last
[48:21] days he is going to reveal himself to
[48:24] you
[48:28] look at Thomas he he refused to believe
[48:31] the testimony of the 10
[48:36] disciples because we have also met an
[48:39] angels in these last days so he is the
[48:41] one that's going to Ral
[48:44] himself so that no one can get
[48:49] Glory out of this message of the hour
[48:52] all glory belongs to God wow
[48:57] if we preach we are just a
[48:59] messenger nothing
[49:01] else
[49:03] Hallelujah so in the message the Easter
[49:07] seal he
[49:09] said look at the Millions on Earth that
[49:11] didn't receive it when Jesus was
[49:15] here Millions he's speaking about
[49:18] Millions didn't even
[49:20] know that he was
[49:25] here can we say the same
[49:28] today millions of people didn't know the
[49:30] message of the
[49:32] hour the prophet was sent he was gone
[49:36] and no one
[49:37] knows what is
[49:42] happening look at the Millions on Earth
[49:44] that didn't receive it when Jesus was
[49:48] here so remember the the evidence is
[49:51] connected with receiving the word of
[49:54] your day that is what he is talking
[49:56] about about but how thankful that we
[49:59] should be this morning to know that we
[50:02] have the direct evidence and the Bible
[50:07] proof we need to be thankful we have a
[50:09] direct evidence and Bible proof that we
[50:14] are included in that great Resurrection
[50:17] morning coming that great Easter morning
[50:20] he's speaking of the great Easter of the
[50:23] day of the resurrection of the seven
[50:24] Church ages of the sleeping Saints
[50:28] this Resurrection this great hist has
[50:31] already begun it started within a people
[50:34] that on the earth now by the revelations
[50:36] of the word of that hour the
[50:39] resurrection started with you and
[50:43] I what is it it is Christ making himself
[50:47] known again to the believer of the
[50:51] ages seeking out his own sheep that will
[50:55] hear his voice
[51:00] he said we have the earnest of
[51:04] it right now in our mortal
[51:07] bodies we have the earnest in our mortal
[51:11] bodies the predestinated ones are the
[51:16] first of
[51:19] course to be
[51:22] quickened when the Holy Spirit comes to
[51:25] claim its own
[51:27] and how does he claim its own by
[51:29] revealing himself personally to his
[51:32] elect in his age Hallelujah this message
[51:36] is directly for each one of
[51:39] us to the predestinated
[51:48] city can we think of something else but
[51:51] to praise
[51:55] God if you have something to thankful to
[51:58] be thankful to be grateful it is the
[52:02] message of the hour to let you know who
[52:04] you are even though how poor we are
[52:07] whatever situation we are in letting you
[52:11] know that you are part of him is
[52:15] enough to say Thank You Lord is enough
[52:18] to be
[52:21] grateful for out of millions of people
[52:24] we are the chosen one
[52:27] at his resurrection he said that we have
[52:30] the earnest of it right now in our M
[52:33] bodies the predestinate one on the first
[52:35] of
[52:38] course you are the
[52:41] first before he reveal himself to others
[52:45] he reveal himself first to his
[52:48] elected and we have the evidence in our
[52:51] molter body when we receive the
[52:54] quickening power we become a new Creator
[52:58] in
[52:59] Christ we are no longer who we are but
[53:03] we become a new Creator in
[53:06] Christ but Satan is always accusing us
[53:10] you are this you are that you are this
[53:12] you are
[53:13] that but he is accusing you of your
[53:18] past he don't recognize your
[53:21] present at the present you are a new
[53:24] Creator in Christ Jesus
[53:27] covered by his blood and whatever
[53:29] accusation he had in you God don't
[53:32] listen to it
[53:34] anymore because God see his blood
[53:39] Co this is what he's doing right now
[53:42] he's claiming You and I by revealing his
[53:44] word to us and the word is a
[53:48] sin so turn it be in the Book of
[53:52] John in the Book of
[53:55] John we can read it he is an eagle and
[54:00] the eagle
[54:01] anointing in the Book of John you cannot
[54:04] read about
[54:06] Parables you cannot read
[54:09] about
[54:10] prophecy but in the Book of John it is
[54:14] always present
[54:18] tense he said all things that the father
[54:21] had our
[54:25] mind it was was a direct
[54:27] message no more prophecy no more history
[54:32] no more Parables it was
[54:36] revealed all things that the father had
[54:39] our
[54:40] mind whether you believe it or not but
[54:43] the Bride of Jesus Christ believe
[54:46] it therefore I said
[54:49] I who you going to believe the
[54:53] report it is he himself speaking
[54:56] revealing
[54:58] himself that he shall take of mine I
[55:01] shall show it unto you in other words
[55:04] reveal the secret of the word to you
[55:07] that is what he has done
[55:10] doing a little while and you shall not
[55:13] see
[55:15] me his
[55:17] physical
[55:18] body you no longer see his physical
[55:22] body and again a little while and you
[55:25] shall see see
[55:27] me because I go to the
[55:30] father a little while you shall not see
[55:33] me you will not see his physical
[55:36] body and again a little while and you
[55:39] shall see me and the seeing is
[55:43] understanding but now you will
[55:46] understand him by the way he reveal
[55:48] himself according to his word not in the
[55:51] physical body but by the revelation of
[55:54] his word we can see Christ to the word
[55:57] in this last
[56:00] days in John
[56:03] 14 verse 18 He said I will not leave you
[56:09] comfortless I will come to
[56:12] you do you believe
[56:15] it so we are not
[56:18] widower we have a
[56:20] husband who promise I will not leave you
[56:24] comfortless I will come to you yes a
[56:26] little while and the world see me no
[56:29] more but ye see me he's talking about
[56:33] another way of seeing which means
[56:39] understanding because I live you shall
[56:41] live
[56:43] also and at that
[56:47] day you shall
[56:49] know at day you shall
[56:54] know you will know
[56:56] know and you need to
[56:59] know this is the message of
[57:02] the even though you don't like it you
[57:06] will know and you need to
[57:10] know this is the Revelation
[57:13] time he couldn't be in them in the form
[57:16] of Jesus of Nazareth but he could be in
[57:19] them in the form of the revelations of
[57:21] the word which is what he has always
[57:25] from the beginning
[57:27] because in the Book of John he said in
[57:29] the beginning was the word and the Word
[57:31] was with God and the Word was God and
[57:34] the Word was made
[57:36] flesh and dwelt among
[57:41] us he was the word
[57:44] first and a word really is just a
[57:47] thought being
[57:48] expressed and so the thought of God
[57:51] became the word of God and the word of
[57:53] God became bled and dwelt Among Us in
[57:55] the form of Jesus of
[57:59] Nazareth
[58:01] but the same Jesus is not in the form of
[58:05] Nazareth
[58:07] today he is in the form of his
[58:11] bride because God was in
[58:14] Christ now it was Christ in many member
[58:18] body Hallelujah and the restoration back
[58:22] to the Garden of Eden restoration back
[58:24] Hallelujah
[58:26] she'll be looking for
[58:29] God here is God
[58:34] sitting because God is a
[58:37] word a thought being
[58:43] expressed Satan will let you doubt
[58:50] it he triying to point you to your
[58:54] physical place how can you be God you
[58:58] commit this you commit that you commit
[58:59] this you commit that but it doesn't
[59:04] take away the realization the reality
[59:09] that you are
[59:11] God's because when the word of God comes
[59:14] to you you are God's because the word of
[59:17] God is being made manifest and we have a
[59:19] portion to fulfill we can
[59:23] create what we can create we can can
[59:26] create an
[59:27] atmosphere Hallelujah if you are sad if
[59:30] you're trouble if you're depressed if
[59:32] you an anxiety you recognize who you are
[59:36] and you can create an atmosphere to come
[59:40] down if you are sick you can create an
[59:43] atmosphere and say hallelujah the Lord
[59:46] God heal all thy
[59:48] diseases because Jehovah Gyra in the Old
[59:52] Testament theeven the the the seven
[59:54] compound name of Jehovah Jehovah Gyra
[59:58] Jehovah Jehovah Shalom
[1:00:01] Jehovah is now made manifest in one
[1:00:05] person and that is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:09] if you want healing is in the Lord Jesus
[1:00:11] Christ if you are deliverer it is in
[1:00:14] Theus Christ if you have Redemption it
[1:00:16] is in the person of Jesus Christ the
[1:00:19] seven compound name is now manifest in
[1:00:22] the name of Jesus that's why there is
[1:00:24] power in his name there is healing in
[1:00:27] his name there is Miracle in his name
[1:00:29] there is salvation in his
[1:00:32] name there is no other name given among
[1:00:36] men which can in which we can be saved
[1:00:39] in the name of Jesus Christ because the
[1:00:41] Old Testament the Jehovah of the Old
[1:00:44] Testament is now Jesus of the
[1:00:51] new so don't be confused
[1:00:56] as brother Ron preached we are the final
[1:01:00] voice to the final
[1:01:02] age God is relying on you and me because
[1:01:07] we are holding eternal life for others
[1:01:10] they may not be in the
[1:01:12] roor but the way you act the way you
[1:01:15] deliver the word you can impart eternal
[1:01:17] life to
[1:01:18] them because if you live the life of
[1:01:21] Christ they become hunger and thirst in
[1:01:25] their life to to become
[1:01:30] you and by doing so they are good to us
[1:01:35] they can give us water they can help us
[1:01:38] amen and it will give them eternal life
[1:01:41] they may not be in the rupture because
[1:01:43] the Bride is a special class of
[1:01:49] people but eternal life for God so Lov
[1:01:52] the world that he gave his only begotten
[1:01:55] son that whosoever believeth on him
[1:01:58] should not perish that is the
[1:02:00] default because
[1:02:02] God is not willing that anyone should
[1:02:05] perish but come unto
[1:02:08] repentance God is so
[1:02:11] gracious but for the bride we are a
[1:02:14] special class of
[1:02:19] people in the Easter seal if we are
[1:02:22] ordained to be on the ground because we
[1:02:25] are born in come to the word speaking
[1:02:27] Lies We are not ordained to be an
[1:02:34] angel if you are ordained to be on the
[1:02:38] ground like the eagle walking in the
[1:02:40] chicken nest if you ordained on that
[1:02:43] ground the holy spirit is here to find
[1:02:49] you he is here to find
[1:02:52] you and when he find you you Rec
[1:02:55] recognize the call there is the voice of
[1:02:58] God in the seventh angel when he shall
[1:03:01] begin to
[1:03:04] sound the mystery of God which you are
[1:03:08] part of will be revealed in this last
[1:03:12] days you know the hour you're living you
[1:03:15] know that these things are supposed to
[1:03:19] happen it's going to
[1:03:22] happen because now it is a prophecy
[1:03:26] and there must be a people to fulfill
[1:03:29] prophecy just like when he said Elijah I
[1:03:32] will said to you
[1:03:33] Elijah Elijah is a
[1:03:36] prophecy but there is also a people that
[1:03:39] will fulfill that prophecy the you in
[1:03:42] that prophecy is you are the people of
[1:03:45] the
[1:03:47] prophecy if there is a prophecy there
[1:03:49] must be a people to fulfill the prophecy
[1:03:51] and we are the Fulfillment of that
[1:03:53] prophecy whether you like it or not how
[1:03:56] come you could go
[1:03:59] along in the message of the
[1:04:02] hour we may have suffering we have so
[1:04:05] many issues in
[1:04:07] life but whether we like it or not
[1:04:09] whether we we we try to run away from it
[1:04:12] we
[1:04:12] [Music]
[1:04:14] cannot we are
[1:04:16] anchored we are
[1:04:18] quickened the quickening power Quicken
[1:04:21] that
[1:04:22] seed and whether we like it it will will
[1:04:30] manifest don't worry about the
[1:04:33] manifestation it will
[1:04:36] manifest whether you like it in his time
[1:04:38] and it season it will manifest itself
[1:04:41] because there is a life within the sin
[1:04:44] and if you are the SE of God you will
[1:04:46] manifest God which is the word in this
[1:04:52] life he said you know that these things
[1:04:55] are to supposed to happen quickly you're
[1:04:57] ruptured to meet it quickly you're
[1:05:00] ruptured to meet it what is ruptured you
[1:05:03] are be quickened by the word you
[1:05:05] recognize the word in your day and you
[1:05:07] are W

[1:05:11] revelation of your
[1:05:17] hour notice what he's talking about you
[1:05:20] are ruptur to meet the word for your day

[1:05:32] what a heavenly father who would give us
[1:05:35] these
[1:05:36] things we have so many troubles and
[1:05:39] trials and testing and sometimes we are
[1:05:42] surrendering as if we are
[1:05:45] surrendering but when the quickening
[1:05:47] power comes upon you it will Quicken
[1:05:50] your
[1:05:51] soul forget everything around
[1:05:54] you keep on
[1:05:56] flying just keep on
[1:05:58] flying keep on
[1:06:00] flying and you will forget the things

[1:06:06] sitting in Heavenly
[1:06:09] places the atmosphere of the presence of
[1:06:13] God when you are sitting you are resting

[1:06:36] we recognize the word of God that was
[1:06:38] sent in our
[1:06:42] day what is our
[1:06:45] purpose in this
[1:06:47] life because there is only three things
[1:06:51] that happened in his resurrection day he

[1:06:58] himself and he had a commission go and
[1:07:01] tell my

[1:07:48] message and he himself reveal that to
[1:07:51] you then you have a commission

[1:08:24] be a lot of singing yes that's why if
[1:08:27] you don't want to worship you will be
[1:08:30] disappointed that in that other side
[1:08:33] there will be a lot of worship a lot of
[1:08:36] singing That's why from then on you need
[1:08:40] to be in the spirit of worship because
[1:08:43] you will be disappointed during the time
[1:08:45] there will be a lot of voices a lot of
[1:08:46] singing a lot of
[1:08:51] worship if you cannot sing just clap
[1:08:53] your hand if you can not clap your hand
[1:09:00] just just enjoy it the presence of the
[1:09:03] Lord because the presence of the Lord
[1:09:05] dwells in his people that is worshiping
[1:09:07] him whatever things you can do just to
[1:09:10] worship him to let him know that you
[1:09:12] appreciate what he has done for you he
[1:09:16] did it not today he did it before the
[1:09:19] foundation of the
[1:09:23] word and de one who will be singing in
[1:09:26] the time on the other side I sure love
[1:09:28] good
[1:09:30] singing The Prophet love good
[1:09:34] singing Do
[1:09:38] You
[1:09:40] amen when I was an
[1:09:45] unbeliever my voice is always Out Of
[1:09:49] Tune so all my friends they are good in
[1:09:52] singing guitars and everything but every
[1:09:55] time they we have a group singing I'm
[1:09:57] always on the other side because my
[1:10:00] voice is just like a chicken
[1:10:09] is but when I got
[1:10:12] converted I don't care what my boys are
[1:10:15] I just want to worship Him Amazing Grace
[1:10:18] How Sweet the Sound Hallelujah I'm on
[1:10:21] the marching in I don't care what they
[1:10:24] say anymore
[1:10:26] I just love to worship Him Hallelujah as
[1:10:29] the prophets I sure love good singing
[1:10:31] but one of the greatest thing that I
[1:10:33] ever had enjoyment is meditation in the
[1:10:37] word
[1:10:39] god that is the most important thing to
[1:10:42] meditate upon the word of God to me
[1:10:45] there's one thing that's fundamentally
[1:10:48] and one thing that's sure and one thing
[1:10:50] that's infallable that's the word of God
[1:10:55] to me all Christian them must be based
[1:10:58] upon that one solid
[1:11:01] thing meditate upon his
[1:11:04] word the word of God that's the
[1:11:06] foundation that's what we're here for
[1:11:08] tonight is to Fellowship around his word
[1:11:11] and meditate upon God that's where
[1:11:15] fellowship with God takes place it is in
[1:11:19] the realm of your
[1:11:22] thoughts and his
[1:11:24] thought in Perfect
[1:11:27] Harmony just like in the Book of Joshua
[1:11:29] chapter 1:8 this book of the law shall
[1:11:33] not depart out of thy mouth and if we
[1:11:36] can bring it in our day this open book
[1:11:41] shall not depart out of thy
[1:11:44] mouth but thou shallal meditate therein
[1:11:47] a night listen to the
[1:11:50] tapes read the word of God day and night
[1:11:53] meditate let not this law the book of
[1:11:57] law the open book in our day let us the
[1:12:00] depart and just be a
[1:12:03] display
[1:12:05] display and thou mayest observe
[1:12:08] according to all that is written therein
[1:12:10] for then thou shallal make thy way
[1:12:13] prosperous if you want to be prosperous
[1:12:15] meditate upon the word of
[1:12:17] God and this
[1:12:20] Prosperity is not like
[1:12:23] a financial Pro Prosperity you can say
[1:12:27] that but this Prosperity is the
[1:12:31] Revelation your relationship intimacy
[1:12:35] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:38] we can prosper by the
[1:12:40] revelation of who he is and who we
[1:12:44] are we can prosper in our Revelation and
[1:12:48] then Thou shalt have good
[1:12:50] success we can have success success to
[1:12:54] overcome this trial success for anxiety
[1:12:57] success for and depression success for
[1:13:00] anything because you meditate on the
[1:13:02] premises of the word of
[1:13:04] God and Paul said I can do all things
[1:13:08] through Christ the revealed word in this
[1:13:10] hour this is the time that we need to
[1:13:12] speak the word speak the word hallelujah
[1:13:16] claim your
[1:13:19] benefits you are the mouthpiece of
[1:13:23] God the don't listen to
[1:13:26] Satan he's just a
[1:13:29] block the more he say you are this you
[1:13:32] are that you say I know I do this and do
[1:13:34] that but I still I am a Son of God you
[1:13:37] have question with
[1:13:39] that bring it to him oh he always accuse
[1:13:42] you this one this one this one oh I know
[1:13:48] that you think I know that I know all
[1:13:50] about it but still I am the son of God
[1:13:56] what can you say about
[1:13:58] that you need to bring it back to him I
[1:14:01] am a Son of God how about
[1:14:04] you you are a son of predition but I am
[1:14:07] a Son of
[1:14:10] God
[1:14:12] hallelujah in the Book of Job he said
[1:14:15] verse one verse6 now there was a day
[1:14:18] when the sons of God came to present
[1:14:20] them themselves before the
[1:14:23] Lord and Satan came also among
[1:14:29] them he wants to
[1:14:33] join and the Lord said unto Satan whence
[1:14:37] comest thou and Satan answered the Lord
[1:14:39] and said from going to and fro in the
[1:14:42] earth and from walking up and down to
[1:14:47] it people with no
[1:14:51] business is going from east to west and
[1:14:54] south nothing to
[1:14:57] he has nothing to do so he just room
[1:15:00] around go here gossip to another talk
[1:15:04] about somebody here talk about somebody
[1:15:07] there if you notice he is going to and
[1:15:11] fro he is doing
[1:15:14] nothing until
[1:15:16] God tell him have you considered my my
[1:15:21] son so every trial that comes our way it
[1:15:24] is with a per
[1:15:26] God God know what he's doing and all way
[1:15:29] to to to build our character is to Tri
[1:15:32] he allow
[1:15:35] Satan to do
[1:15:40] that so in Eden God would come down in
[1:15:43] the cool of the day and walk with men
[1:15:45] and have fellowship with men upon the
[1:15:47] Earth
[1:15:49] amen he just came down and just
[1:15:52] fellowship with his sons and
[1:15:53] daughters the that's a good thing but
[1:15:56] there was but here we see Satan is among
[1:15:58] the son so we're trying to walk with
[1:16:00] them upon the Earth because he wants to
[1:16:01] be
[1:16:02] worshiped he wants to insert
[1:16:05] himself he wants to become somebody he
[1:16:08] wants to be a good preacher he wants to
[1:16:10] be a good Deacon he wants to be a good
[1:16:13] song
[1:16:15] leader he wants to be somebody in the
[1:16:21] church he wants to have fellowship with
[1:16:23] men and Pro subject his thought into men
[1:16:27] and shap man's thinking to become
[1:16:29] submissive to his will and desire so
[1:16:33] that he can rule man's heart and control
[1:16:35] his thought and be the god of men and be
[1:16:38] worshiped by men is he doing it
[1:16:41] today unless you are Sons and Daughters
[1:16:43] of God you will give
[1:16:45] in to his
[1:16:47] plan that's why the the the the thought
[1:16:51] of men are evil
[1:16:53] continually in this last
[1:16:55] that is insanity how can the
[1:16:59] thought think about evil things
[1:17:06] continually but here was a man named job
[1:17:09] that Satan could not walk upon the Earth
[1:17:13] and fellowship with his man with his
[1:17:14] thought nor could he project his thought
[1:17:17] into job to do evil against the Lord and
[1:17:19] then it is the season that job come to a
[1:17:23] realization
[1:17:26] of the quickening power within
[1:17:30] him Satan took away his family his
[1:17:33] business and everything even his skin
[1:17:36] but during that time the quickening
[1:17:39] power Quicken his I know my redeemer
[1:17:42] live
[1:17:43] it
[1:17:45] Hallelujah I know my redeemer live it
[1:17:48] and he shall stand at the latter day
[1:17:51] upon the
[1:17:53] earth and the thought after my skin will
[1:17:56] destroy this body yet in my flesh I
[1:17:58] shall see God whom I shall see for
[1:18:00] myself and my eyes Shall Behold and not
[1:18:03] together though my Reigns be consumed
[1:18:05] within me he has this great
[1:18:09] testimony Hallelujah in Revelation
[1:18:13] chapter
[1:18:15] 1 verse 17 and
[1:18:17] 18 which brother
[1:18:20] Bram uh quote this when he preached the
[1:18:24] Easter seal
[1:18:26] Revelation 1:17 and when I saw him I
[1:18:31] fell at his feet as
[1:18:33] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:18:36] saying fear not I am the first and the
[1:18:40] last and I am he that liveth and was
[1:18:44] dead and behold I am alive forever more
[1:18:47] amen and have the keys of hell and of
[1:18:51] death so a key is the revelation
[1:18:55] remember that J was asked who Am I who
[1:18:58] do you say I am and some say you are
[1:19:01] jiah jeriah and it was personally as
[1:19:06] of Peter who am I to
[1:19:09] you he said Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:19:12] of the Living
[1:19:14] God in in Matthew 1:17 and Jesus
[1:19:17] answered and said unto him blessed art
[1:19:19] thou
[1:19:21] Simon so Revelation is a blessing
[1:19:28] if you want blessing ask for Revelation
[1:19:31] because Revelation is more than anything
[1:19:34] else Simon vuna for Flesh and Blood hath
[1:19:37] not revealed it unto you but my Father
[1:19:39] which is in heaven Revelation was given
[1:19:41] by God it was not even revelation of
[1:19:45] Peter
[1:19:46] himself because flesh and blood has not
[1:19:48] revealed to you in other words it was
[1:19:51] not your Revelation Peter but my Father
[1:19:53] which is Ty of the Spirit it was him who
[1:19:56] revealed to you for with him the spirit
[1:19:58] of God shall come he will guide you into
[1:20:01] alter in Matthew 16:18 and I say unto
[1:20:04] thee that thou art Peter Upon This
[1:20:08] Rock upon this Revelation I will build
[1:20:11] my church and the gates of bell shall
[1:20:13] not prevails again it and I will give
[1:20:16] unto thee the
[1:20:18] king of the Kingdom of Heaven I will
[1:20:22] give the the key the revelation of the
[1:20:24] kingdom of heaven and he said and
[1:20:26] whatsoever thou shal bind on Earth shall
[1:20:29] be bound in heaven and whatsoever shall
[1:20:31] lose on Earth will be loose in heaven
[1:20:34] the key of
[1:20:35] [Music]
[1:20:36] revelation will bind and will lose
[1:20:41] people if they
[1:20:44] reject or accept the message there is
[1:20:49] binding and there is
[1:20:51] loosing because Peter was Commission he
[1:20:54] was given the key to the
[1:20:57] kingdom of
[1:21:03] Christ and the preaching of the open
[1:21:06] book will bind those who will reject it
[1:21:10] and will loose those who accepted they
[1:21:13] will be loose in darkness they will
[1:21:15] loose un belief amen so that's why Paul
[1:21:19] got said in in 18 but though we are an
[1:21:23] angel from heaven preach any the gospel
[1:21:25] unto you than that which we have
[1:21:27] preached unto you let him be a curse
[1:21:29] there will be a
[1:21:31] binding If You Preach another gospel If
[1:21:34] You Preach another Revelation outside of
[1:21:36] the revealed word of God let him be a
[1:21:43] curse and Paul repeated it verse n and
[1:21:48] we said before so I say now
[1:21:53] again if any man preach any other gospel
[1:21:57] any Revelation any interpretation
[1:22:00] man-made
[1:22:02] Doctrine unto you than that ye have
[1:22:05] received let him be a
[1:22:09] cursed so the key of hell and death is a
[1:22:12] revelation that will given to a people
[1:22:14] in the last days because there is a
[1:22:17] promise that there would be a people on
[1:22:19] Earth in the last day that would not see
[1:22:23] death it is a
[1:22:25] promise Romans 8 but if the spirit of
[1:22:29] him that raise up Jesus from the dead
[1:22:31] dwells in
[1:22:32] you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:22:35] dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body
[1:22:38] by his spirit that we could Quicken make
[1:22:42] a life it will change this Mortal into
[1:22:51] immortality quickening power is the key
[1:22:53] that unlock
[1:22:55] mortality to a people in this
[1:22:58] age the word Quicken is to cause to live
[1:23:02] that which was dead or to make
[1:23:05] alive or to give
[1:23:08] life OB seed Quicken into life
[1:23:12] germinating springing up growing so to
[1:23:15] Quicken the seed is to germatize it to
[1:23:19] Life by sun and water so they speak of
[1:23:22] process that take place because
[1:23:24] something to live to be
[1:23:26] quickened we need to lay in the presence
[1:23:28] of the
[1:23:30] son to be matured we cannot be matured
[1:23:34] in the light of the candle of the seven
[1:23:36] Church ages we are beyond the candle
[1:23:41] ages we are beyond the candle light we
[1:23:44] are now living in the Sun the rising of
[1:23:47] the Sun the rising of the
[1:23:50] Su to take away the greenness out of us
[1:23:55] so the spirit that will Quicken your
[1:23:57] mortal body in this hour begins by the
[1:23:59] process of God shining the light of the
[1:24:01] word of this hour into the seed of what
[1:24:04] he placed Within
[1:24:05] You by
[1:24:08] predestination so we cannot get away for
[1:24:10] this
[1:24:12] predestination your destiny is already
[1:24:16] being
[1:24:16] prepared thank the
[1:24:19] Lord and whether we like it if we are
[1:24:22] predestinated we will align
[1:24:26] to the
[1:24:28] seed that was quickened in this last
[1:24:35] days in the message Easter
[1:24:38] seal continuing have I ever told you
[1:24:41] anything in the name of the Lord but
[1:24:43] what
[1:24:44] happened he said yeah I want to tell you
[1:24:46] about it every time has it been
[1:24:49] perfectly at the platform every time has
[1:24:51] it happened just like he said this was
[1:24:54] the set every
[1:24:56] time the prophet share share his vision
[1:25:00] it was always being
[1:25:03] fulfilled he fulfilled every
[1:25:07] promises he he he speaks about I stood
[1:25:10] there look over the time I seen tens and
[1:25:13] thousand of times thousand coming Young
[1:25:15] And Men Women running throwing their
[1:25:17] arms around me screaming I look back and
[1:25:20] see myself laying on the bed oh Lord let
[1:25:22] me look the past the curtain of
[1:25:26] time so is's sharing his experience
[1:25:30] beyond the curtain of
[1:25:33] time so there was a great Eternal youth
[1:25:38] meeting no old no Young no babies
[1:25:42] nothing because when her daughter Sharon
[1:25:45] was died she was just a little
[1:25:49] baby but when she saw it beyond the
[1:25:51] curtain of times she was already a
[1:25:56] teenager and the old woman that he lead
[1:25:59] to Christ at the age of 90 when he saw
[1:26:01] it beyond the curtain of time he was a
[1:26:04] young
[1:26:06] people so if
[1:26:08] somebody tell you that he goes beyond
[1:26:11] the curtain of time and tell you that he
[1:26:14] saw an old man he saw a
[1:26:19] baby he didn't go behind the curtain of
[1:26:22] time because brother been so any old men
[1:26:27] or babies and we know that the prophet
[1:26:31] is the yard stick of all that
[1:26:34] experiences no old men no babies only
[1:26:37] young people because when his daughter
[1:26:40] died being a baby he saw it as a young
[1:26:43] girl beautiful girl The Old Woman become
[1:26:46] a young
[1:26:47] girl that's why I
[1:26:50] always tell some of the brothers that
[1:26:54] the message follow me at the age of
[1:26:58] 27 so I have never experienced what it
[1:27:02] was to be in the Youth Camp Fellowship
[1:27:06] but thank God we have a youth meeting
[1:27:08] Eternal youth meeting one of these days
[1:27:17] hallelujah so heaven we are going in is
[1:27:21] an eternal youth meeting
[1:27:24] amen the prophet met the Splendor of
[1:27:27] Youth when he crossed the Cur of time
[1:27:29] his account is the Y stick against which
[1:27:32] any claim of people who experience LL
[1:27:35] should be that this
[1:27:39] stick so let's continue
[1:27:42] on what is it the quickening power that
[1:27:45] will cut us away that the the great
[1:27:48] quickening
[1:27:50] power that's what I'm in Arizona for
[1:27:53] right now
[1:27:55] there's many people sitting here stood
[1:27:58] right here at Phoenix and heard me tell
[1:28:00] you from this platform thus said the
[1:28:03] Lord and how many remember it now go
[1:28:07] something is fixing to
[1:28:09] happen I saw seven Angel come then Life
[1:28:13] Magazine as a it floated
[1:28:16] across here 27 miles high 30 miles
[1:28:20] across that is not Fred Suman this other
[1:28:23] gin Norman them sitting back there stood
[1:28:25] right there when seven angels appeared
[1:28:28] right there on the hill he shook the
[1:28:31] hills for miles around like that he saw
[1:28:34] seventh angel and we know that the
[1:28:35] seventh angel was the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:38] himself the angel of the Covenant there
[1:28:41] stood seven angels and throw a sword in
[1:28:43] your hand and said go home and open the
[1:28:46] Seven Seals that are given and here they
[1:28:48] are the true mystery of marriage and
[1:28:51] divorce and serpent seed and all these
[1:28:53] things that's been fooled about is th
[1:28:56] said the Lord what it is the quickening
[1:28:59] power coming to the church making her
[1:29:02] ready this hour that we are approaching
[1:29:05] quickening power Hallelujah all these
[1:29:08] things that happening our generation it
[1:29:11] is for the purpose to give us the
[1:29:13] quickening power in is last days
[1:29:18] hallelujah quickening power coming to
[1:29:20] church making her ready this hour that
[1:29:23] we're approaching power he said oh God
[1:29:26] help us to receive it help us to believe
[1:29:31] it the sameen tonight help us Lord to
[1:29:35] believe
[1:29:37] it I know there are so many destructions
[1:29:41] when you open the YouTube that will go
[1:29:43] against the
[1:29:45] prophet but who are
[1:29:49] they the angel of the Lord when the
[1:29:52] prophet was still a little boy said said
[1:29:55] don't smoke Don't drink don't nothing
[1:29:57] because I prepare I prepare something
[1:29:59] for
[1:30:01] you but this preacher who was once a
[1:30:04] drunkard a sinner will go against the
[1:30:08] prophet how can you go against the
[1:30:10] prophet when the angel of the Lord
[1:30:12] prepared his body for this
[1:30:15] ministry and God fulfilled everything in
[1:30:18] his
[1:30:22] ministry she just depend on what
[1:30:24] attitude you take to it whether it's
[1:30:26] going to do you any good or not though
[1:30:29] see you have to believe that you don't
[1:30:31] believe it it won't do you one bit of
[1:30:34] good Hallelujah so it's up to you but I
[1:30:39] believe as a bride of Jesus Christ as
[1:30:41] the seed of God you will always believe
[1:30:43] the word if you even though if you
[1:30:45] cannot understand it if you are a seed
[1:30:47] it will Quicken the quickening power
[1:30:49] will say Amen to every word of God
[1:30:51] because you will recognize Who You Are
[1:30:57] that's just depend on what attitude you
[1:30:59] take whether he's going to do you good
[1:31:01] or not though you have to believe that
[1:31:03] you don't believe it it won't do you one
[1:31:05] bit of good how Samuel stood there
[1:31:08] before the people and said have I ever
[1:31:10] told you anything in the name of the
[1:31:11] Lord but what happened did I ever beg
[1:31:15] you for your money to live on no but we
[1:31:18] want the king anyone that's the way the
[1:31:20] church is today they want their own
[1:31:23] ideas they want their own interpretation
[1:31:25] they want their own their group they
[1:31:27] want their own understanding they want
[1:31:29] somebody that will lift them up higher
[1:31:32] and follow a man instead of follow the
[1:31:33] way the the word of the
[1:31:37] Lord they walk right around well it just
[1:31:39] go to show the quickening power is not
[1:31:43] there if you go around and say oh I am
[1:31:46] this I am that I am this I am not the
[1:31:49] quickening power is not in
[1:31:51] there because if the quicking power is
[1:31:54] that the son can do nothing with it
[1:31:58] himself but if that queening power is
[1:32:01] there you recognize like that little
[1:32:03] Eagle that his mama that's the word that
[1:32:06] said the Lord that's what God promised
[1:32:09] that's what was for told and that's
[1:32:12] exactly what happened we're Beyond any
[1:32:14] Shadow of Doubt potentially in the
[1:32:17] resurrection right
[1:32:18] now the Saints getting ready to be taken
[1:32:23] up in the a

[1:32:42] the sake of time I will just Le was last
[1:32:46] quote did you in the message the
[1:32:49] Redeemer did you ever stop to think this
[1:32:51] morning as far as returning that is
[1:32:53] becoming invisible he's already here
[1:32:56] with us
[1:32:59] now don't look for
[1:33:02] him in the near future he is here right
[1:33:06] now how do you know he is here because

[1:33:17] your mid who do you think is preaching
[1:33:19] to you
[1:33:20] today the bless may be brother Mario but
[1:33:23] the word that come out it was God
[1:33:27] himself trying to Quicken you to his
[1:33:30] word don't look at the man look at the
[1:33:36] word the Lord Jesus ising another word
[1:33:39] or another dimension right here today in
[1:33:42] the form of the
[1:33:44] spirit what a blessed people we

[1:33:53] your confor
[1:33:55] I will never leave you nor forsake
[1:34:00] you the Lord Jesus is in another world
[1:34:03] or another dimension right here today in
[1:34:06] the form of the spirit his spirit is
[1:34:10] blending in with our
[1:34:16] spirit our eyes can see him because they
[1:34:20] they're physical yet unless there would
[1:34:23] something happen happened that we could
[1:34:24] see Vision but he is here just as
[1:34:29] visible just as real as he was in the
[1:34:32] day that he spoke to Mary at the
[1:34:35] grave or he met clas on his road to the
[1:34:39] mayus his presence is here do you
[1:34:43] believe
[1:34:47] it it can be filled with that f with
[1:34:51] that inner church that's on the inside
[1:34:54] of human body called the New Birth the
[1:34:57] soul has been magnetized unto him can we
[1:35:01] say amen hallelujah his spirit is now
[1:35:05] blending with our spirit that's why we
[1:35:08] recognize our day and our
[1:35:15] message we
[1:35:17] are now the loud year is now about to
[1:35:21] close
[1:35:26] and when you open the news it's all
[1:35:28] about why did
[1:35:30] Trump win in this
[1:35:35] election why did Trump win this
[1:35:39] election we know that Trump was elected
[1:35:44] as the
[1:35:45] 45th
[1:35:49] president and
[1:35:50] today he won as the
[1:35:55] 47
[1:35:59] president in the
[1:36:01] US Constitution the 22nd amendment you
[1:36:05] can only run two
[1:36:14] terms his first term he was the 45th
[1:36:19] then comes Biden the 46
[1:36:26] President we are not looking for a woman
[1:36:28] to run and W as a
[1:36:31] president and many of the message circle
[1:36:33] is already being
[1:36:36] disappointed because what they are
[1:36:39] expecting that a powerful woman will
[1:36:43] arise but they didn't realize that
[1:36:46] prophecy was already fulfilled in Joe
[1:36:49] Biden b a Roman Catholic a Roman
[1:36:53] Catholic
[1:36:54] president which is Joe
[1:36:57] Biden align with JF
[1:37:00] Kennedy with a vice president or maybe a
[1:37:05] vice president a woman president and
[1:37:08] during their nug he for a purple col
[1:37:11] dress we fulfill the sixth
[1:37:15] prophecy maybe a Roman Catholic
[1:37:18] President or a beautiful cruel woman
[1:37:23] isn't he so
[1:37:25] cruel he legalized
[1:37:27] abortion he legalized that a man can be
[1:37:30] a
[1:37:31] woman and a woman can be a
[1:37:33] man he legalized that a man can join the
[1:37:36] woman's
[1:37:39] Sports he confused the mind of the of
[1:37:43] the
[1:37:45] student you can choose what you want you
[1:37:47] want to be a cat you want to be an
[1:37:49] animals you want to they legalize all
[1:37:51] that a cruel woman and that will fill
[1:37:54] the six
[1:37:56] Vision but now in this last days this
[1:37:59] election Trump won
[1:38:01] again the 47th
[1:38:06] president before Biden he was the 45
[1:38:09] 45th which is f which is a number of
[1:38:11] race Biden 46 president which is a
[1:38:16] number of 666 which is Roman
[1:38:20] Catholicism and this last Trump
[1:38:26] we have the last
[1:38:27] Trum the last
[1:38:32] ter that's why in First Corinthians
[1:38:35] chapter
[1:38:36] 15 51 behold I show you
[1:38:40] mystery that we shall not sleep but we
[1:38:43] shall be changed in a moment in the
[1:38:45] twinking of an eye at the last
[1:38:54] at the last Trum for the trumpet shall
[1:38:56] sound and the dead shall rise rais
[1:38:59] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:39:01] the quicking power is here to prepare
[1:39:06] us for this corruptible m p on
[1:39:09] incorruptible incorruption and this
[1:39:13] Mortal must put on
[1:39:17] immortality we have the last
[1:39:20] Trump no not remember that Trump trump
[1:39:26] by just a little word that they
[1:39:30] stand God back it up and he won the
[1:39:34] election because he stand by the word of
[1:39:36] God just a little word and God back him
[1:39:40] up how about you the Bride of Jesus
[1:39:43] Christ you have the word in this last
[1:39:45] days if got back up from to Wi then how
[1:39:48] about you the bright which is the word
[1:39:49] of God in this last day you have the
[1:39:51] word of God in this last day
[1:39:54] we don't say that this is the this is
[1:39:56] our sign but the prophet said in the
[1:39:58] message
[1:39:59] countown
[1:40:00] countown whatever the achievement of
[1:40:03] this word is God is doing the same in
[1:40:06] his
[1:40:10] spiritual when they say
[1:40:13] peace and
[1:40:15] prosperity then sudden Destruction
[1:40:18] come isn't Trump saying we will restore
[1:40:22] America again but we need to be careful
[1:40:25] this must be the last
[1:40:27] year before the going
[1:40:30] out we don't wait for that purple to
[1:40:33] manifest as a president because that is
[1:40:35] already past tense that is already
[1:40:38] history and we don't expect something
[1:40:42] now that Trump is the President we need
[1:40:44] to be careful maybe this
[1:40:47] is the time for us to go closer to God
[1:40:52] to go be
[1:40:54] here we don't expect that America to
[1:40:57] prosper again are you expecting
[1:41:00] prosperity in Trump
[1:41:02] Administration we are expecting for the
[1:41:04] body change because the quicking power
[1:41:07] was already given to us in order for us
[1:41:09] for this body to change from corruptible
[1:41:13] into
[1:41:14] corruptible and that purple was already
[1:41:18] fulfilled and the prophet said I think
[1:41:21] it is in the hidden life he said that
[1:41:24] every
[1:41:24] prophecy has a
[1:41:27] dual or a compound
[1:41:30] meaning we know the
[1:41:33] purple is a color of
[1:41:38] royalty Revelation chapter
[1:41:42] 17 but when I open the message at Thy
[1:41:46] word the purple also is a color
[1:41:50] according to the law of adoption is also
[1:41:54] a
[1:41:58] purple did you catch it or maybe not I
[1:42:02] want to repeat it again the purple is a
[1:42:06] comound meaning and kamis fulfilled the
[1:42:09] scripture but for the Bride of Jesus
[1:42:11] Christ under the adoption message after
[1:42:14] our Tor we are Hallelujah we are ready
[1:42:18] to be adopted because we talk about him
[1:42:21] we we act like him we talk like him and
[1:42:23] the father will will will request all
[1:42:27] bring the
[1:42:28] Rob and that robe is the Rob colored
[1:42:33] purple at TH word maybe and when the boy
[1:42:36] proved to be right boy the message at
[1:42:39] Thy
[1:42:40] word which in our case is the holy
[1:42:44] spirit that takes word to the father and
[1:42:46] gives a report of what we
[1:42:49] do then if we be found faithful for so
[1:42:52] long
[1:42:53] like the child was then he was taken out
[1:42:56] in public square and a purple robe was
[1:43:00] put on him there was a law of
[1:43:04] adoption Hallelujah that is the law of
[1:43:07] adoption that the purple color parallel
[1:43:10] to adoption the law of adoption we are
[1:43:13] the adopted Sons and Daughters of God we
[1:43:16] are predestinated unto
[1:43:18] adoption that's why we speak like him we
[1:43:21] act like him we decide I like
[1:43:24] him and we say thank you Lord let us
[1:43:27] stand door
[1:43:32] feet and may the
[1:43:34] Lord may the Lord encourage you the
[1:43:38] quickening power here is to Quicken us
[1:43:40] to prepare ourselves we are not looking
[1:43:43] praise
[1:43:44] God for a better
[1:43:47] economy but we are looking for the
[1:43:49] changing of our body everything is ready
[1:43:52] for
[1:43:56] and the Victory of Donald Trump is just
[1:44:00] an
[1:44:02] indication that our time is too
[1:44:05] short God bless you let us pray for one
[1:44:08] another and encourage one another our
[1:44:10] time is too
[1:44:11] short we need to encourage another the
[1:44:15] time has
[1:44:17] come at the twigling of an
[1:44:20] eye amen those who are dead in CH shall
[1:44:23] rise first that we which are alive and
[1:44:25] remain shall be
[1:44:27] quickened from corruptible into
[1:44:29] corruptible the time has come when they
[1:44:32] see peace and prosperity be
[1:44:35] careful Hallelujah God bless you and God
