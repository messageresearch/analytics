[27:12] rock nothing's moving
[27:14] me and the Bible says and I began to see

[27:21] foundation of the world and the 4 and 20
[27:23] Elders began to praise God and they sang
[27:25] a new song I wonder if some of you the
[27:28] only time that you'll begin to sing is
[27:30] when you get over there I believe saints
[27:32] of God the closer you get to Jesus
[27:35] Christ maybe I'm wrong but the closer
[27:39] you get to Jesus Christ and for the
[27:42] whole

[28:36] note yeah I just want you to know BR
[28:38] this Sunday brother Paul durksen from up
[28:41] in uh
[28:43] Saskatchewan uh he is the one that took
[28:46] over the church that I was the pastor
[28:47] there in
[28:49] Saskatchewan he is now their pastor and
[28:52] the last time he came through I was out
[28:54] of town so he let me know he was coming
[28:57] in and I said well brother Paul being
[28:59] that you're here why don't you take a
[29:01] service for me well that's not why I'm I
[29:04] said I know but I'd like to have you
[29:06] because I love to have a good
[29:09] crosssection of the five-fold ministry
[29:11] not that I'm looking for somebody to
[29:13] preach for us that's not it but I
[29:16] believe you're going to be blessed I
[29:17] believe brother Paul is a man called of
[29:19] God and uh so we'll look forward to him
[29:22] preaching for us on Sunday morning I
[29:25] want to give a big special thanks to all
[29:28] of those that helped our sister Kelly
[29:30] Saunders and brother Steve to put
[29:33] together the family night um yeah you
[29:36] don't have to have little ones to come
[29:37] to family
[29:40] night okay we do this for all of you man
[29:43] we had we had soups and we had chilies
[29:47] and we had uh those corn chips with
[29:51] cheese nacho and I I tell you it was
[29:53] just a good time and it is always a
[29:56] blessed time for me to be able to sit
[29:58] down and fellowship with some of you on
[30:02] a onetoone basis sit around a table have
[30:05] some food a time of Fellowship so if you
[30:07] didn't make it you missed
[30:10] it you missed it you
[30:13] should amen amen don't get mad at
[30:18] me it'd be like you throwing a birthday
[30:20] party and nobody show
[30:22] up you blow out the candles by yourself
[30:26] wouldn't that be
[30:28] happy birthday to
[30:30] me you don't want to do that we do it
[30:33] because it's an opportunity for our
[30:36] family church to get together and have a
[30:39] time of Fellowship so if you miss it
[30:41] that's that's okay i' I'd love to have
[30:43] you all be there and everything uh I
[30:46] also want to say I certainly had a
[30:48] lovely time with my young couples the
[30:50] other day Sunday
[30:52] afternoon um as a pastor I think it's
[30:55] very very important once in a while I
[30:58] have meetings with the young couples we
[31:00] sit down and have some some questions
[31:03] and answers have some good uh spiritual
[31:06] Fellowship one with another and I get a
[31:08] good cross-section of kind of feeling
[31:11] their temperature their mood what
[31:13] they're what the things that they're
[31:14] going through problematic areas what
[31:17] because uh uh it certainly is uh uh a
[31:22] late hour and the enemy is doing
[31:25] everything he can to try to
[31:29] divide and conquer that's right he
[31:32] starts with the first family it's what
[31:35] he did in Eden he does it all the way
[31:38] down so if he can come in and and and
[31:41] cause any kind of a div division he'll
[31:44] do it that's right and so we don't we
[31:47] want to make sure that we don't have no
[31:49] spirits on us that want to divide and
[31:51] conquer and and everything like that we
[31:53] want to come together for the unity of
[31:56] the faith can we say Amen Amen to that
[31:58] and I want to say to our young musicians
[32:00] that are here tonight and I appreciate
[32:03] it because the only way that you guys

[43:15] a labor
[43:17] pain you know the prophet was talking
[43:19] about the cloud about the blue sky but

[56:16] the 90 seconds left the
[56:21] science in Matthew chapter 4 or 24

[56:27] here now learn a parable of the Fig Tree
[56:33] when his branch is yet tender and puted
[56:37] forth leaves ye know that summer is
[56:41] night now he was
[56:44] talking to
[56:46] Israel watch that that is your calendar
[56:51] that is your time piece you need to see
[56:55] watch the movement of
[56:57] Israel because that is the question of
[57:00] the disciples when and how do we know
[57:04] and the prophet and and Jesus Christ was
[57:06] telling them at the
[57:09] signs but then he said in the
[57:13] 37th or
[57:16] 35 When Heaven and Earth shall pass away
[57:21] but my words shall not pass pass away
[57:26] remember
[57:28] this Heaven and Earth will pass away but
[57:34] I'm telling you this is thus said the
[57:37] Lord my word will not pass away and then

[57:44] and the hour know
[57:47] it no man know not the angels of heaven
[57:51] but my father only continue brother up
[57:53] to 37 thank you

[58:00] also the coming of the son of
[58:03] man for as in the days that were before
[58:07] the flood they were eating they were
[58:10] drinking they were marrying and giving
[58:13] in marriage until the day that Noah
[58:16] entered into the ark is it the same
[58:18] condition
[58:20] amen they don't really care about what's
[58:24] happening right now
[58:26] now I think on the 23rd there was a big
[58:29] shootings in Florida and two nights
[58:32] before there was a big shooting in
[58:36] Maine those are the signs but then
[58:39] here's the Revelation on the 25th he
[58:43] said there was a five virgins 10 virgins
[58:47] they
[58:48] prepared they were not uh they don't
[58:51] sleep they were watching for the coming
[58:54] of the the
[58:55] bridegroom I think I am one of them amen
[58:58] I think I am one of them that that's
[59:01] that not uh that's as I was preaching
[59:05] last two weeks ago or a couple weeks
[59:07] ago about be sober be
[59:11] vigilant
[59:13] amen now the prophet said we're we're
[59:16] right now seeing the very same thing
[59:18] that Jesus said would take place this
[59:22] own word spake it spoke it as it was in
[59:26] the days of lot so it will be at the
[59:29] coming of the son of man the same thing
[59:32] look at your
[59:35] country here now it's
[59:38] perverted look at the
[59:41] newspapers I seen an analysis where
[59:45] homosexual is on the increase about 20%
[59:48] over the last year on the west coast the
[59:52] sins of Sodom took look how everything
[59:56] being perverted the
[59:59] waters the streams everything
[1:00:03] contaminated did you hear about the the
[1:00:05] The Waters from
[1:00:07] Michigan people had cancer because of
[1:00:09] the waters and the prophet was speaking
[1:00:11] here
[1:00:14] 1959 the diseases viruses that the
[1:00:19] doctors know nothing about it or about
[1:00:22] where at the end time flee to the Rock
[1:00:27] flee to Christ get into him quickly amen
[1:00:31] see we don't forget brother that the
[1:00:34] coid
[1:00:35] 19 we don't forget the wars the the for
[1:00:38] the first time in history that the the
[1:00:41] White House became a rainbow
[1:00:44] house and the prophet was saying that
[1:00:47] the increase of the perversion of the
[1:00:53] homosexuals
[1:00:59] there was a news well brother brandham
[1:01:02] you you just heard uh he read the
[1:01:05] newspaper so I was looking about the
[1:01:10] news there was a man standing he said
[1:01:14] remember
[1:01:15] sin even it legalized by men it's still
[1:01:19] sin in the eyes of
[1:01:22] God there was a man standing in in the
[1:01:25] US
[1:01:26] capital and he put a sign board and
[1:01:31] said Don't Legalize
[1:01:36] rape well what does that mean well they
[1:01:40] legalize
[1:01:42] abortion that's killing
[1:01:44] babies they legalize gay
[1:01:48] marriage that's that's a um
[1:01:52] filthiness but you know there's new no
[1:01:55] new thing under the sun it will go back
[1:01:58] from the days of Noah and lot but here
[1:02:02] he said please Don't Legalize rape
[1:02:06] maybe more and more years that's why the
[1:02:09] prophet said he cannot see the darkness
[1:02:11] of this
[1:02:15] time here the the billboard in
[1:02:18] Chicago it said life is short get a
[1:02:23] divorce
[1:02:27] it was a big
[1:02:28] billboard in
[1:02:31] Chicago to me it was a blasphemy amen
[1:02:35] you take the word of the Lord and show
[1:02:39] it to the people about the filthiness of
[1:02:42] what you're doing so that you can make
[1:02:43] more
[1:02:44] money the lawyers posted

[1:03:10] fro and knowledge shall be
[1:03:13] increased he saw the end time but the
[1:03:18] the angel said don't write sealed it up
[1:03:23] because there will be be a man a a
[1:03:26] prophet anointed of an eagle
[1:03:29] anointing he he can see
[1:03:32] everything he said but then he
[1:03:36] said many shall run to and fro and
[1:03:40] knowledge shall be
[1:03:42] increased now you can see more colleges

[1:27:43] coughing I don't even have a
[1:27:48] hair I cannot wait to live in a perfect
[1:27:51] place am you know the prophet said he
[1:27:55] over there the paradise emptied out and
[1:27:59] now all the all the saints went to to to
[1:28:04] uh another dimension and then according
[1:28:08] to the prophet in the things that are to
[1:28:10] be he said you know God gave you the
[1:28:13] desire you you well I'm poor I don't
[1:28:16] have a you know I have so many desires
[1:28:19] but I cannot come here because I don't
[1:28:20] have enough money to to pay or buy my
[1:28:24] desire so when I was young when I read
[1:28:28] that I said oh I I like to to live in
[1:28:31] the in the uh next to the waterfalls and
[1:28:34] the the water the mountain meets the
[1:28:38] ocean and the prophet said God will
[1:28:41] grant the desire of your heart amen he
[1:28:44] said God is a god of
[1:28:47] variety if if I brother if you like
[1:28:50] jokes there's somebody over there next
[1:28:53] to you God will put you over there if
[1:28:55] you're
[1:28:56] serious there's so many serious people
[1:28:59] over there
[1:29:02] too God is a god of
[1:29:07] vary that's why you know the disciples
[1:29:09] are always
[1:29:12] fighting but God gave you the desire of
[1:29:16] your heart over there amen thank you
[1:29:18] Lord now that's why I uh brother Ron
[1:29:21] when when the Prophet was preaching this
[1:29:24] this uh things that are to be and then
[1:29:26] the next time he preached the future
[1:29:28] home of the Heavenly
[1:29:29] bride and in the Heavenly bride he said
[1:29:32] now everything over there is like a
[1:29:36] transparent
[1:29:40] gold can you see transparent gold here
[1:29:44] no but God prepared a place for you he
[1:29:49] went
[1:29:50] first to prepare a place for
[1:29:55] you brothers and sisters there is no
[1:29:59] time to be like holding
[1:30:04] on I I pray that this
[1:30:07] message will touch your
[1:30:10] heart we agonize here the tree you can
[1:30:13] see the Tre are dying you know
[1:30:16] California I was reading the history the
[1:30:19] this the the news that they
[1:30:23] the why they allow the the the abortion
[1:30:28] because the fetus are very
[1:30:31] expensive so they use the fetus as a Max
[1:30:36] Factor now they use that for
[1:30:40] makeup if if somebody here put makeup
[1:30:44] please I don't like the
[1:30:49] fetus but that's what they do
[1:30:53] you know the the the they mix that with
[1:30:55] kind of a of uh dust from India and the
[1:31:00] the people from India are young kids
[1:31:03] digging that kind of sand or dust so
[1:31:07] that can make a Max Factor or like a
[1:31:10] makeup but here brothers and
[1:31:14] sisters we believe that the coming of
[1:31:17] the Lord is near if you see man I I I
[1:31:21] I'm a minister of the Gospel I see a
[1:31:23] person
[1:31:26] dying one time I saw this man like

[1:31:34] I was holding him and then he was
[1:31:38] like he was he was something suffering
[1:31:42] he wants he wants to live
[1:31:46] more the the queen of of England the
[1:31:49] prophet
