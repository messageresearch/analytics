[10:15] Long ago, there was a king who was
[10:17] devoted to his people, serving them
[10:20] faithfully, honestly, and sincerely.
[10:23] King David was a man after God's own
[10:25] heart, who re reigned over Israel for 40
[10:28] years. During his reign, the ark of the
[10:30] covenant that held the Ten Commandments
[10:32] and represented God's presence among the
[10:35] Israelites had been held captive by the
[10:37] Philistines. King David gathered all his
[10:40] soldiers and all the people of Israel to
[10:42] rescue the ark of the covenant from
[10:43] enemy hands. When they returned to
[10:46] Jerusalem, David called for Zadok, the
[10:48] priests, and the Levites, and said unto
[10:50] them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of
[10:52] the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both
[10:55] ye and your brethren, that you may bring
[10:57] up the ark of the Lord God of Israel,
[10:59] unto the place that I have prepared for
[11:01] it. Thus all Israel brought up the ark
[11:04] of the covenant of the Lord, with
[11:05] shouting, and with sound of the cornet,
[11:08] and with trumpets, and with symbols,
[11:10] making a noise with sulties and harps.
[11:13] David danced and played, and the great
[11:15] crowd sang with joy, giving praises to
[11:18] God and worshiping the Lord Jehovah.
[11:25] [Music]
[11:32] Don't you know it's time to praise the
[11:36] Lord and sanctuary of his
[11:41] spirit? Set your mind on him and let
[11:45] your praise begin. And the glory of the
[11:49] whole
[11:49] [Music]
[12:02] world. You live within the praises of
[12:06] his
[12:07] people. He love to hear us call upon his
[12:11] name.
[12:13] So set your mind on him and let your
[12:17] prayers begin. Let the glory all this
[12:28] place. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[12:35] Don't you know it's time to praise the
[12:38] Lord in the sanctuary of his holy
[12:44] spirit? So set your mind on him and let
[12:48] your praise begin. The glory of the Lord
[12:52] will fill his
[12:54] way. Praise the
[12:59] Lord. Praise the Lord.
[13:05] Praise the
[13:07] Lord the
[13:10] Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[13:16] [Music]
[13:20] Years after bringing the ark of the
[13:22] covenant back to Jerusalem, King David
[13:25] desired to build a temple for the Lord.
[13:27] But God did not permit this as he was a
[13:29] man of war. Solomon, his son would be
[13:32] given that honor, which would take years
[13:33] of challenges, decisions, and
[13:35] accomplishment. This is a story that
[13:37] tells how obedience and faithfulness
[13:40] brought blessings of wealth and wisdom
[13:42] to a king who was chosen to build a
[13:44] house for Jehovah. It also shares how
[13:46] today God once again has provided a
[13:48] place for his people to gather to praise
[13:51] and worship the King of Kings. Most
[13:53] importantly, may we be reminded to be a
[13:55] holy temple that Christ can dwell in,
[13:57] having first place in our lives. Listen
[14:00] and watch as the evening light
[14:01] fellowship Sunday school children share
[14:04] through scripture and song, "What house
[14:06] will you build
[14:09] [Music]
[14:16] me as weather? May your spirit work
[14:21] within
[14:23] us as we gather. May we glorify your
[14:30] name. Knowing well that as our hearts
[14:35] begin to
[14:37] worship. We'll be blessed because we
[14:41] can.
[14:46] will be blessed because we came.
[14:53] As we gather, may your spirit work
[14:57] within us.
[15:00] As we gather in, we glorify your
[15:06] name. Knowing well that as our hearts
[15:10] begin to
[15:13] worship, we'll be blessed because we
[15:17] [Music]
[15:20] came. We'll be blessed because we came.

[18:37] [Music]
[19:03] Then King David answered and said, "Call
[19:06] me Bash.
[19:14] Sheba. And she came into the king's
[19:17] presence and stood before the king. And
[19:19] the king said, "As the Lord liveth, thou
[19:21] hath redeemed my soul out of all
[19:23] distress, even as I swear unto thee by
[19:26] the Lord God of Israel, saying,
[19:28] Assuredly, Solomon, thy son shall reign
[19:30] after me, and he shall sit upon my
[19:32] throne in mystead, even so will I
[19:35] certainly do this day."
[19:46] Then Basha bow her face to the earth and
[19:49] did reverence to the king and said, "Let
[19:51] my lord king David live
[19:59] forever." And King David said, "Call me
[20:01] Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet
[20:05] and Baniah the son of Jehoa." And they
[20:08] came before the king.
[20:27] The king also said unto them, "Take with
[20:30] you the servants of your lord, and cause
[20:32] Solomon and my son to ride upon my own
[20:35] meal. bring him down to Guehon, and let
[20:37] Zedoth the priest and Nathan the prophet
[20:40] anoint him there king over Israel, and
[20:43] blow ye with the trumpet, and say, "God,
[20:45] save King
[20:53] Solomon." Then ye shall come up after
[20:56] him, that he may come and sit upon my
[20:58] throne, for he shall be king in mystead.
[21:00] and I have appointed him to be ruler
[21:02] over Israel and over Judah. And Baniah
[21:05] the son of Jehoeda answered the king and
[21:07] said, "Amen." Amen.
[21:28] [Music]
[21:41] Hallelujah.
[21:45] [Music]
[22:36] Glory.
[22:41] Hallelujah.
[22:53] Heat. Heat.

[23:14] Heat. Heat.
[23:51] And so that the priest took a horn of
[23:54] oil out of the tabernac. Tabernacle
[23:56] anoint Solomon and they blew the
[24:01] [Music]
[24:06] trumpets and
[24:09] all and all people said God save King
[24:12] Solomon.
[24:14] God save.
[24:17] [Music]
[24:26] And all the people came after him. And
[24:29] the people piped with pipes and rejoiced
[24:32] with great joy so that the earth went
[24:35] with them.
[24:44] [Music]
[26:01] And David said to Solomon his son,
[26:03] Solomon, my son, know thou God of thy
[26:07] father and serve of him with a perfect
[26:09] heart and a willing mind. For the Lord
[26:12] searchth all hearts, and understandeth
[26:16] all the
[26:17] imaginations of the thoughts. If thou
[26:20] seek him, he will be found of thee. But
[26:24] if thou forsake
[26:26] him, he will be cast off forever.
[26:36] Be strong and of good courage, endure
[26:37] it. Fear not, nor be dismayed. For the
[26:40] Lord God, even my God, will be with
[26:42] thee. He will not fail thee, nor forsake
[26:45] thee until thou has finished all the
[26:47] work for the service of the house of the
[26:49] Lord.
[26:57] [Music]
[27:06] [Applause]
[27:14] [Music]
[29:46] As David begins addressing his son, the
[29:49] sc the court scribe comes forward
[29:51] bearing a scroll.
[29:58] David receives the scroll and places it
[30:00] in the hands of his son. It contains the
[30:03] plans for the temple which David himself
[30:06] has drawn under the inspiration of
[30:18] God and my people. As for me, I had in
[30:21] mine heart to build a house of rest for
[30:24] the ark of the covenant of the Lord and
[30:26] for the foottool of our
[30:34] God. But God said unto me, thou shalt
[30:37] not build a house for my name because
[30:39] thou has been and of war and has shed
[30:42] light.
[30:51] How be it, the Lord God of Israel chose
[30:54] me before all the house of my father to
[30:57] be king over Israel forever.
[31:05] And he said unto me, Sol Solomon, thy
[31:09] son, he shall build my house and my
[31:12] courts, for I have chosen him to be my
[31:14] son, and I will be his father. Moreover,
[31:17] I will establish his kingdom forever, if
[31:21] he be constant to do my commandments and
[31:23] my judgments as at this day.
[31:36] Now therefore, in the sight of all
[31:39] Israel, the congregation of the Lord,
[31:42] and in the audience of our God, keep and
[31:44] seek for all the commandments of the
[31:47] Lord your God, that ye may possess this
[31:51] good land, and leave it for the
[31:53] inheritance for your children after you
[31:56] forever.
[32:03] Now set your heart on your soul to seek
[32:06] the Lord your God. Arise therefore and
[32:09] barely the sanctuary of the Lord God to
[32:13] bring the ark of the covenant of the
[32:15] Lord and the holy vessels of God into
[32:18] the house that is to be built to the
[32:22] name of the Lord.
[32:28] Take it now, for the Lord has chosen
[32:31] thee to build an house for the
[32:33] sanctuary. Be strong and do
[32:37] it. 1 Chronicles 29 tells us that as all
[32:41] Israel stood before David, he spoke,
[32:44] saying, Solomon, my son, know thou the
[32:47] God of thy father, and serve him with a
[32:49] perfect heart and with a willing mind.
[32:51] For the Lord searchth all hearts, and
[32:53] understands all the imaginations of the
[32:55] thoughts. If thou seek him, he will be
[32:58] found of thee, but if thou forsake him,
[33:00] he will cast thee off forever. May we
[33:02] too continue to follow the words of King
[33:04] David and seek the Lord daily. As the
[33:07] king knew the building of the structure
[33:08] would be great. Chapter 29 shares that
[33:11] David spoke to the people of Israel,
[33:12] saying, "Moreover, I have set my
[33:15] affection to the house of my God. I have
[33:17] of mine own proper goods of gold and
[33:19] silver which I have given to the house
[33:21] of my God over and above all that I have
[33:24] prepared for the holy house. Who of you
[33:26] my dear people will offer willingly
[33:28] consecrating himself today to the Lord?
[33:31] Then the chief of the fathers and
[33:33] princes of the tribes of Israel and the
[33:35] captains of thousands and of hundreds
[33:37] with the rulers of the king's work
[33:39] offered willingly
[33:48] [Music]
[34:08] Let us give to the house of the
[34:13] Lord. Let our feet stand in your
[34:19] gates. Let us give to the house of the
[34:23] Lord.
[34:26] Let our feet stand in your
[34:31] gates. We will pray for the peace of
[34:37] Jerusalem. May all love you be
[34:43] secure. May the world always be peace
[34:47] within your
[34:49] walls. May goodness and hope always
[34:53] endure.
[34:56] Let us go to the house of the
[35:01] Lord. Let our feet stand in your
[35:07] gates. Let us give to the house of the
[35:13] Lord. Let our feast stand in your gates.
[35:19] [Music]
[35:24] They gave for the service of the house
[35:26] of God, of gold, 5,000 talents and
[35:29] 10,000 drs, and of silver 10,000
[35:32] talents, and of brass, 18,000 talents,
[35:36] and 100,000 talents of iron. And they,
[35:40] with whom precious stones were found,
[35:41] gave them to the treasury of the house
[35:43] of the Lord. Then the people rejoiced
[35:45] for that they offered willingly, because
[35:48] with perfect heart they offered
[35:49] willingly to the Lord. And David the
[35:51] king also rejoiced with great joy.
[35:57] And David said to all the congregation,
[35:59] "Now bless the Lord your God and all the
[36:02] congregation. Blessed the Lord God of
[36:05] their fathers and bow down their heads
[36:08] and worship the Lord and the King."
[36:14] And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the
[36:17] Lord and burnt and offered burnt
[36:20] offerings unto the Lord. on tomorrow
[36:22] after that day even a thousand
[36:24] bulllocks, a thousand rams and a
[36:26] thousand
[36:28] lambs with their drink offerings and
[36:31] sacrifices in abundance for all
[36:41] Israel and did eat and drink before the
[36:44] Lord on that day with great gladness.
[36:47] And they made Solomon the son of David
[36:49] king the second time and anointed him
[36:51] unto the Lord to be chief governor and
[36:54] Jadok to be a
[37:02] priest. Then Solomon sat on the throne
[37:05] of the Lord as king instead David his
[37:08] father and pro
[37:11] pres and all Israel obeyed him.

[43:18] [Music]
[43:20] [Applause]
[43:32] When King David knew the end of his
[43:34] years were drawing near, he gathered the
[43:37] leaders of Israel together and told them
[43:39] to support Solomon so that he would be
[43:41] successful in this great
[43:43] task. After his death, King Solomon made
[43:46] preparations to build the temple.
[43:51] Phoenician builders were called, and he
[43:53] had great ships bring logs of cedar,
[43:56] juniper, and cypress wood from foreign
[44:00] lands. Gold, silver, precious stones,
[44:03] and tons of stone carved from distant
[44:06] mountains were brought to Jerusalem. He
[44:09] ordered iron, and more bronze than could
[44:11] be weighed to make nails and other
[44:13] things for the great temple. 1
[44:16] Chronicles 22:15 records, "There were
[44:19] workmen in abundance, heers and workers
[44:22] of stone and timber, and all manner of
[44:25] cunning men for every manner of work."
[44:28] First Kings 6:7 tells us, "Solomon had
[44:31] the stones finished at quarry, so that
[44:34] no hammer or chisel or any iron tool was
[44:37] heard in the temple while it was being
[44:39] built." Every day the children of Israel
[44:42] worked long and hard to build the
[44:43] temple.
[44:48] [Music]
[44:57] [Music]
[45:07] [Music]
[45:21] [Music]
[45:32] For more than seven years, Solomon
[45:35] diligently embarked upon this great
[45:37] work, building a temple for the Lord to
[45:39] dwell. We have seen God repeat history
[45:42] through a man of God, our pastor,
[45:43] Brother Ron Peterson, praying, planning,
[45:46] and working hard to have a place for God
[45:48] and his people. Let's take a minute and
[45:50] watch the work that has taken place.
[45:59] [Music]
[46:04] God is building a house. God is building
[46:09] a house. God is building a house that
[46:14] will stand.
[46:17] It is being put together by the one we
[46:23] [Music]
[46:29] s Christ is head of this house. Christ
[46:33] is head of this house. Christ is head of
[46:38] this house that will stand.
[46:43] Christ is Lord. Christ is king. Joyou
[46:47] praises we will sing. Christ is head of
[46:51] this house that will stand.
[46:56] We are part of this house. We are part
[47:00] of this house. We are part of this
[47:04] house. that will
[47:07] stand. We are members of the body in
[47:12] Christ. We are made one. We are part of
[47:17] this house that will stand.
[47:21] God is building a house. God is building
[47:27] a house. God is building a house that
[47:31] will stand.
[47:35] It is being put together by the lively
[47:39] sound weather. God is building a house
[47:44] that will
[47:46] stand. Christ is head of this house.
[47:51] Christ is head of this house. Christ is

[48:04] praises we will sing. Christ is head of
[48:09] this house that will
[48:12] stand. God is building a house that will
[48:17] stand.
[48:35] But when
[48:36] God came to his own temple, the church,
[48:41] the the people, when he came to them, he
[48:45] filled it. The temples that were
[48:47] dedicated just like he did at Solomon's
[48:49] temple. He filled it not with creeds,
[48:52] not with denominations, but with
[48:54] himself. He filled the temple. Praise
[48:57] the Lord. Amen. With his shakina glory.
[48:59] Amen. God always fills his temple at the
[49:03] day of dedication.
[49:05] He fills his temple. He fills it with
[49:08] himself. The same thing today. God will
[49:11] fill every temple that will thoroughly
[49:14] dedicate itself to him. Amen. Any
[49:17] persons that will the temple is not this
[49:20] little building here. The temple is not
[49:23] the one in Salt Lake City. The temple is
[49:26] not the one in Rome. Amen.
[49:30] The temple is you. Amen. You are the
[49:34] temple that God wants to dwell in and
[49:38] express himself through it. The all
[49:41] nations might know him. You are living
[49:44] images of God that God wants to work
[49:48] through. Praise the Lord. And any time
[49:50] that any man or any woman will forget
[49:52] all the falsehood that they've heard in
[49:55] the world and come back to the line of
[49:57] the scripture. Amen.
[50:00] And will keep in line just like Solomon
[50:02] did to what Moses did, Moses did to what
[50:06] God did. God always respected it. And if
[50:10] we'll come back to the original
[50:12] dedication, Amen. and will open our
[50:15] hearts and empty
[50:17] ourselves. God in dedication as we give
[50:21] it to him will fill our temple with his
[50:24] shakina glory. Praise the Lord. Then the
[50:28] living God will be moving in a living
[50:30] church among a living people and will
[50:33] spread forth his glory. Amen. Then
[50:35] together someday, one being this way and
[50:38] one this way and one one part of the
[50:39] country shall come together to make the
[50:42] bride. Amen. will be caught up in the
[50:44] air to meet him. Amen. Now this lovely
[50:48] church this building that the people
[50:51] with their tokens of their
[50:55] livelihood with their love for
[50:58] Christ the worshippers has dedicating
[51:02] today this place of worship that people
[51:05] could come and worship.
[51:08] Now my sincere prayer is that every
[51:11] worship will worshiper will dedicate his
[51:14] own temple to worship in the temple
[51:18] that's being dedicated for worship.
[51:21] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[51:24] That's the real dedication.
[51:28] While building the temple, the word of
[51:30] the Lord came to Solomon, saying,
[51:33] "Concerning this house which you are
[51:34] building, if you will walk in my
[51:36] statutes and execute my judgments, and
[51:39] keep all my commandments and walk in
[51:41] them, then I will carry out my word with
[51:43] you, which I spoke to David your father.
[51:45] And I will dwell among the people of
[51:47] Israel, and will not forsake my people."
[51:50] When Solomon had finished the temple, it
[51:53] stood four stories tall, 90 ft long and
[51:56] 30 ft wide. He made beveled windows for
[51:59] the house. It was built of stone cut
[52:01] from mountains and prepared in the
[52:03] quarry, so that neither hammer nor axe
[52:05] or any tool of iron was heard in the
[52:07] house while it was being built. A door
[52:10] to the middle chamber was on the right
[52:11] side with a set of winding stairs
[52:14] leading to the top. The interior walls
[52:16] of the building were completely covered
[52:18] in cedar wood and decorated with
[52:20] beautiful carvings of cherubam, palm
[52:22] trees, and open flowers. For the
[52:25] entrance to the inner sanctuary, he made
[52:27] doors of olive wood. The walls and
[52:29] floors were covered in pure gold as well
[52:31] as the whole altar. Not one spot of
[52:33] stone was showing. There wasn't a single
[52:36] service of the temple that was without
[52:38] decoration. It was truly a beautiful,
[52:40] magnificent sight.
[52:53] [Music]

[1:02:23] Now that King Solomon has completed his
[1:02:25] father's vision, it is time to bring the
[1:02:27] holy vessels and the ark of the covenant
[1:02:29] into the temple. Solomon assembles the
[1:02:32] elders of Israel and all the heads of
[1:02:35] the tribes, the chief of the fathers of
[1:02:37] the children of Israel in Jerusalem.
[1:02:41] The elders of Israel watch as a
[1:02:43] procession of priests carry the ark of
[1:02:46] the covenant into the temple.
[1:03:08] As it is placed upon the altar of the
[1:03:10] inner sanctuary, a great cloud appears
[1:03:13] as the glory of the Lord fills the
[1:03:15] temple.
[1:03:28] The cloud is so thick that the priests
[1:03:30] cannot perform their work. As he sees
[1:03:33] the glory of the Lord fill the temple,
[1:03:36] King Solomon knows that God is pleased.
[1:03:39] Now is the time to offer a praise and
[1:03:41] thanksgiving to God.
[1:03:53] Scripture tells us in 2 Chronicles 6
[1:03:56] that Solomon made a brazen scaffold and
[1:03:58] set it in the midst of the court and
[1:04:01] knelt down before all the congregation.
[1:04:03] And Solomon spread forth his hands
[1:04:05] toward heaven. And he said,"Lord God of
[1:04:08] Israel, there is no God like thee, in
[1:04:10] heaven above or on earth beneath, who
[1:04:13] keepeth covenant and mercy with thy
[1:04:15] servants that walk before thee with all
[1:04:17] their heart. Therefore now, Lord God of
[1:04:20] Israel, keep with thy servant David, my
[1:04:22] father, that thou promised him, saying,
[1:04:24] There shall not fail thee a man in my
[1:04:26] sight to sit on the throne of Israel, so
[1:04:29] that thy children take heed to their
[1:04:30] way, that they walk before me, as thou
[1:04:33] has walked before me." And now, oh God
[1:04:35] of Israel, let thy word, I pray, they be
[1:04:37] verified, which thou spakest unto thy
[1:04:40] servant David my father, that thine eyes
[1:04:43] may be open toward this house night and
[1:04:44] day, even toward the place of which thou
[1:04:47] has said, my name shall be there, that
[1:04:50] thou mayest hearken under the prayer
[1:04:52] which thy servant shall make towards
[1:04:53] this place. Then hear thou in heaven,
[1:04:56] and forgive the sin of thy servants, and
[1:04:58] of thy people Israel, that thou teach
[1:05:00] them the good way wherein they should
[1:05:02] walk, and give rain upon thy land, which
[1:05:05] thou hast given to thy people for an
[1:05:07] inheritance, that they may fear thee all
[1:05:09] the days that they live in the land,
[1:05:10] which thou gave us unto our fathers. May
[1:05:13] all people of the earth know thy name to
[1:05:16] fear thee, that they may know that this
[1:05:18] house which I have builded, is called by
[1:05:21] thy name, O Lord God.
[1:05:34] Heavenly
[1:05:40] Father, what house will you build
[1:05:42] [Music]
[1:05:44] me? God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[1:05:51] [Music]
[1:05:53] Surely there is a blueprint in
[1:05:56] heaven that we might know how to have a
[1:06:00] house that is pleasing to you.
[1:06:05] I pray heavenly
[1:06:07] father that each one that saw this
[1:06:12] reenactment of what had gone on in
[1:06:16] Jerusalem, Father God, may we take
[1:06:19] heed knowing that you have a house, a
[1:06:22] temple that is not made with
[1:06:26] hands. That's the temple that you desire
[1:06:30] to dwell in.
[1:06:32] Therefore, Father, let us take
[1:06:34] heed to live a life that is pleasing to
[1:06:38] you. Grant to us revelation, Father,
[1:06:41] even as David was and Moses and
[1:06:44] different ones were given
[1:06:46] blueprints, Father, you have given us a
[1:06:48] blueprint called the message of the
[1:06:51] hour. How that we can live a life that
[1:06:55] is pleasing to you. I pray heavenly
[1:06:59] father that you will allow each one to
[1:07:03] bring their sacrifices of praise and
[1:07:06] respect and honor to
[1:07:08] you and would you
[1:07:10] consume our sacrifice even as you did
[1:07:14] David's and receive it
[1:07:16] father we ask
[1:07:19] it in the mighty and precious name of
[1:07:23] our lord and savior Jesus
[1:07:25] Christ amen
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:33] man. When all the children of Israel saw
[1:07:36] how the fire came down and the glory of
[1:07:39] the Lord upon the house, they bowed
[1:07:41] themselves with their faces to the
[1:07:43] ground upon the pavement and worshiped
[1:07:45] and praised the Lord, saying, "For he is
[1:07:48] good, for his mercy endures
[1:07:52] forever.
[1:07:54] [Music]
[1:08:00] Surely the
[1:08:03] presence of the Lord is in this

[1:08:47] midst of his
[1:08:50] children the Lord
[1:08:53] said he would
[1:08:55] be. It doesn't
[1:08:58] take very many
[1:09:02] It can be just two or
[1:09:06] three. And I feel that same sweet
[1:09:11] spirit that I
[1:09:14] felt off times
[1:09:17] before. Oh,
[1:09:20] surely I can
[1:09:22] say I've been with the
[1:09:28] Lord.

[1:10:15] holy hush around us.
[1:10:19] As God's
[1:10:21] glory fills this
[1:10:23] place, I've touched the
[1:10:26] hem of his garment and I can
[1:10:31] almost see his
[1:10:34] face and my
[1:10:36] heart is
[1:10:39] overflowing with the
[1:10:41] fullness of his joy.
[1:10:45] I know with a
[1:10:49] doubt that I've been with the
[1:10:55] Lord.
[1:10:57] Surely the
[1:11:00] presence of the Lord is in this

[1:12:40] I can hear the crushing angels wings. I
[1:12:46] see
[1:12:47] glory on each face.

[1:12:55] presence of the
[1:12:57] Lord is in. I can hear the
[1:13:01] brush. I can hear the brush of angel

[1:13:31] light fellowship Sunday school children
[1:13:33] tonight, let's have them all
[1:13:36] stand. Give them another round of
[1:13:48] applause. Children, you can sit down.
[1:13:51] It's been a lot of effort has gone into
[1:13:53] this tonight. children, you may have
[1:13:54] your seats for a moment if you want to
[1:13:56] sit down. A lot of effort has gone into
[1:13:58] this tonight and we want to thank you
[1:14:01] most of all for coming tonight and
[1:14:03] Sister Tina has a few words that she
[1:14:04] would like to share.
[1:14:07] Everything that went well has just been
[1:14:10] the Lord. If you would have seen how
[1:14:12] much handicap we had through a lot of
[1:14:14] our practices, it was like how was this
[1:14:16] going to happen? But that sermon this
[1:14:18] morning came to life all through when
[1:14:20] God inspired me to start the play.
[1:14:23] Concentrating on him, focused, just
[1:14:25] praying, asking, and he'd have things
[1:14:27] work out. And it was such a wonderful
[1:14:30] experience for me. And these children
[1:14:32] did absolutely wonderful, wonderful.
[1:14:43] And but even though I felt that the Lord
[1:14:46] was working, he gave me some God with
[1:14:48] skin on it because I needed a lot of it.
[1:14:51] And we have all those helpers if they
[1:14:53] could come out that they did helped
[1:14:56] manage the kids. They did all the parts
[1:14:59] to pull their parts, their verses. Let's
[1:15:04] get you up here because you did a lot of
[1:15:06] work. Let's get you up
[1:15:10] here. The practices, the endless
[1:15:13] practices. We all have busy lives. And
[1:15:16] so, you know, trying to fit in
[1:15:18] practices. There was Becky, what's what
[1:15:20] are you
[1:15:22] doing? We all have busy lives, but we
[1:15:25] just kind of kept saying, "What day
[1:15:27] worked?" And and we'd find another day.
[1:15:29] And so, they all helped wonderfully. And
[1:15:33] and on top of that, on the back of your
[1:15:37] um uh program where it says that every
[1:15:42] cunning man was brought for all manner
[1:15:45] of work, God did that for us today. He
[1:15:48] brought these people and that program
[1:15:50] has a list of all those others. Can all
[1:15:52] those others stand? We had slideshow
[1:15:54] people. We have sound people. We had
[1:15:57] painters. All right, if you're here, we
[1:16:00] had a whole lot of others that helped as
[1:16:02] well. I guess they're a little shy,
[1:16:06] but we had all those that did
[1:16:13] too. Yeah, if you want to you want to go
[1:16:16] home. And the second person beside the
[1:16:19] Lord of helping me
[1:16:24] out, my husband was so
[1:16:28] endlessly supporting me
[1:16:33] and I thank him so
[1:16:35] much for the practices for the work for
[1:16:38] me at the
[1:16:40] computer and sewing and painting and but
[1:16:44] it was it's so worth it to me when you
[1:16:47] see what you get with the the the
[1:16:50] enjoyment on these children and what
[1:16:53] they learn and how much they love it.
[1:16:55] Let's do it again next week. Sister
[1:16:57] Tina, hold on. We only do this every
[1:17:00] seven
[1:17:02] years. So, I thank you all so very much.
[1:17:05] And all of you parents, the sacrifices
[1:17:08] you made to come bring your kids. I
[1:17:10] mean, surprise is not very close to many
[1:17:13] of your homes, the distances that you
[1:17:15] had, the waiting periods of waiting at
[1:17:17] the church or a restaurant or a coffee
[1:17:19] shop. I so appreciate that so much.
[1:17:23] Thank you all very much.
[1:17:50] Brother Ron, did you want to come and
[1:17:51] say a few words?
[1:18:01] I'd like to have Sandy if she'd come out
[1:18:03] here right now for a moment. Wow, that
[1:18:06] was something. Let's give them a big
[1:18:08] hand again.
[1:18:12] Yeah. Wow.
[1:18:14] You really don't know how much work and
[1:18:17] effort it takes to do this, especially
[1:18:20] with the little ones and everything, but
[1:18:23] they did a tremendous job. All of them,
[1:18:26] the readers, the ones that helped build
[1:18:28] the temple and everything. I just uh I
[1:18:31] tell you what, it's inspiring. You just
[1:18:33] watch little kids, but you know that
[1:18:36] this was a real event that happened
[1:18:38] years ago and everything. And uh my my
[1:18:43] it just is uh inspiring. I want to say
[1:18:46] that. Sister Tina, Brother Mark, come up
[1:18:48] here if you would please. Uh this is on
[1:18:51] behalf of Sandy and I in the church.
[1:18:55] We'd like to go ahead and give you these
[1:18:59] flowers and a
[1:19:01] card. And that's it's definitely not
[1:19:04] enough. Go ahead and give it to him.
[1:19:07] Should get him a car. Should get him a
[1:19:09] car.
[1:19:11] or a motor
[1:19:12] home and a two week vacation anywhere in
[1:19:16] the
[1:19:18] world. You're going to need some RNR
[1:19:20] after this. Lord did it all. The Lord
[1:19:22] did it all. Yeah. But he had skin on it.
[1:19:25] And guess what? Um, brother Mark, you
[1:19:28] get your wife back now. And uh so
[1:19:32] anyway, uh on behalf of all of the work
[1:19:35] that you did and the inspiration,
[1:19:37] everything starts by a vision. And
[1:19:41] Sister Tina, really, you wrote this
[1:19:43] play. You made the scenes. You did all
[1:19:46] of that. She put all of the parts
[1:19:48] together. And the Bible says that
[1:19:51] without a vision, the people perish. But
[1:19:54] here she put together a vision of this
[1:19:57] play and the put the helpers and the
[1:20:00] different ones together. And and I just
[1:20:03] want to say on behalf of pastor of this
[1:20:06] church, what a tremendous job you did
[1:20:11] and great will be your reward.
[1:20:14] Amen. God bless you. Did I forget
[1:20:16] anything, Sandry? No. Just thank you to
[1:20:19] everybody. You there's just so many
[1:20:21] different people that are involved. So
[1:20:23] it just is such amazing how it all comes
[1:20:25] together. And so the Johnson family,
[1:20:27] they're hiding. That's the shy ones.
[1:20:33] No, they're just I so much appreciate is
[1:20:36] there is so much talent in this church.
[1:20:38] I mean, you know, I maybe I had a vision
[1:20:41] of a slideshow and I said,
[1:20:44] Matt, yes, I need help. And he just sure
[1:20:48] whipped that together. No problem. You
[1:20:50] know, and it just the talent is just and
[1:20:54] brother Ron allows that talent to be
[1:20:56] used and that I am so thankful for.
[1:20:59] Yeah. the singers, the musicians.
[1:21:02] It's amazing.
[1:21:04] Amen. And when we think of Evening Light
[1:21:07] Fellowship and you look back and you can
[1:21:09] see each one of you are an integral
[1:21:13] part. We've grown up together.
[1:21:17] You look back over the years and you see
[1:21:18] the things that God has done and the
[1:21:21] things we've come through. Each and
[1:21:24] every one of you are an integral part.
[1:21:26] If we were to take all of the photos and
[1:21:30] and really go way back all the way to
[1:21:32] Maryland and everything, my my my
[1:21:36] I just want to say on behalf of myself
[1:21:39] and my wife, I am
[1:21:42] humbled and I am extremely pleased to be
[1:21:47] represented with such a um charactered
[1:21:50] people. I feel as one of the most
[1:21:54] blessed pastors in the message and I
[1:21:57] want to say to all of you God's riches
[1:22:00] blessings be upon each one and I pray
[1:22:05] that we
[1:22:07] will this is my
[1:22:10] prayer.
[1:22:12] Lord, let me be the
[1:22:14] pastor with the largest
[1:22:17] representation of bride members to take
[1:22:21] as many home with me as I can. And I
[1:22:26] that's my desire. I don't want to leave
[1:22:28] nobody. I want to inspire,
[1:22:32] dig around the tree,
[1:22:37] resort with all longsuffering,
[1:22:40] but to do everything that I can to get
[1:22:43] as many to go and to be there because I
[1:22:46] believe he's coming soon. The Jews
[1:22:49] always say next year in Jerusalem. I'm
[1:22:53] believing that we're going to see the
[1:22:55] coming of our Lord very, very soon.

[1:26:25] things of the Lord, that when they get
[1:26:27] older, they shall not depart from it. I

[1:26:32] watched many of these little ones now
[1:26:37] raise up, get married, and have children
[1:26:40] of their own. Father, we realize that
[1:26:43] time is going by so quickly. I pray
[1:26:46] heavenly father you will bless each and
[1:26:48] everyone that is here, every family
[1:26:50] represented and I pray that you will
[1:26:53] allow us father to be
[1:26:56] found pleasing in your sight at your
[1:26:59] soon coming. We thank you. Bless the
[1:27:02] remainder of our evening. Let people
[1:27:04] have a time of fellowship and enjoy uh
[1:27:08] one another's company. We thank you for
