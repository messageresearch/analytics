in here had no idea went back to my chair figured the thought had come back to me didn't come back to me until I sat right there Then I thought oh my I'm glad we got a new sound system or I'd be laying down on the floor listening to this monitor here and you know I they have that Bluetooth thing that's available with the hearing aids now well last time I was here in the pulpit and I was saying something to you my phone's in the back but it rang in my ears and I thought all of you heard it and um I don't remember which one of these you turn it off with but my I had a little bit of a meltdown right there praise the Lord I'm glad to be a Christian I'm glad God's opened my eyes to this end time message I have to see you talk about Grace that the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob before he ends this world he would give a message of Grace he would send a prophet with a word of God to turn your hearts back to the faith Hallelujah the original Faith the original word hallelujah you talk about Grace almighty God how I praise thy name this morning that you have allowed us to see the opening of the word the Bible open the mysteries of God that down Through the Ages has been hid and now the very pieces to the puzzle all are all coming back together amen praise the lord we had a lovely wedding with uh brother Elias and sister Ari the other day uh beautiful setting out there at Lake Pleasant and just had a lovely time I want to thank all of those the workers always the ones behind the scenes that do so much God bless them amen ah the grass and the fencing out here looks very nice am we've done that for our children I pray that that would be a blessing to you I think Zach love all did such a great job the stonework looks so lovely we've done this we've done slowly doing some additions here to the church and and everything I want to say I appreciate it it's all kind of new to me I had to walk this morning by the I haven't even got to see it so I told Sandy I'm going to walk in the front door and when I did I walked by all the grass I kind of want to go run round on a little bit but uh give me a couple weeks to gather my strength back this has really uh kind of knocked me down and everything but by his grace I'm getting stronger every day my wife being an exceptional nurse taking care of me Force feeding me and uh everything then my daughter she makes this concoction of some kind of juices you know my goodness beets and garlic and all of this stuff and woo that'll put a zip in your step but so I appreciate all of this do you know 2023 is almost over wow but look at the things he's brought you through the same God that began to speak to you when you was just a young child Yes actually he spoke to you before the foundation of the world Hallelujah placed upon your ring and merited favor wiped away your mind all of that when you withstood Satan when he rose up there in heaven CU that's where the battle started cast it down to earth amen and it became a human battle God wiped all that out of your mind gave you spiritual Amnesia and he was so pleased to watch CU he knew you would rise up again and tell him no Hallelujah tell him no I won't serve you in Satan's Eden no matter how bad it gets I Will Not Bow amen amen so we thank God I believe that 2024 let me make a prediction it's going to be a powerful year both for heaven and for hell cuz right now we have Kingdoms in conflict that's huh the greatest battle ever fought right now is being fought right right and so right now we know that that these things because all of the pieces when you see Israel when you see all these things begin to come to pass look up for your Redemption draw night Hallelujah I believe that 2024 is going to be an exceptional year I am just expecting the coming of the Lord amen I believe he will there's too many signs there's too much coming to pass too quickly that it can't be soon so we want to be ready each and every one amen we're going to have a baby dedication here in just a moment but uh to all of the visitors brother Mark and anzel God bless you it's good to have you here and uh I remember when I left New Zealand and got on the planes

little on to Jesus please yes I will read in the Bible in Mark chap 10 verse 13 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked them rebuked those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and bless them amen we have here Willie Amaya come up here and his wife sister Marie Mar Brother Willie has nine children and seven are with him here in the US and they've just recently had a new addition God bless you I see a a little wrapped up baby girl in Many Colors amen may I have the little baby oh doesn't she look pretty J huh here she is so is this child number nine we we they have named this little baby girl ala it means happiness amen

your heads with me heavenly father I hold in my arms this little baby girl and I ask that you would bless her and watch over her all the days of her life I pray a blessing of God upon her the same one father that even as blessed the children of the elders in the scriptures and each one said oh God would you be with them and watch over them watch over their footsteps and be with them oh God so that they might live a life that is pleasing to you our brother Willie and sister Marie they've ask father that this little child be dedicated and so here we are father with this little girl in our arms here she is born in the most wicked of times in a time when all hell has been let loose but father also there'd never be a time when God would not raise up a standard against it and here we have a shining message a glorious message Father that the children of God can walk in the light father I pray that little Alessa father that she will be happy father in her walk with God because our

praise the Lord that's what we're waiting for is for him to come back not only for me but for you and not only for you but for me also praise the Lord thank you musicians God richly bless you if you have your Bibles turn with me to the Book of John chap 1 and we'll read verses 1-4 certainly an honor to be in the house of the Lord amen and I trust we've gathered with an intent and purpose to hear from him this morning amen amen yes sir John chap 1 and verse one it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and I want to say in him is life that's right and the life was the light of man and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not and there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light are you seeing what you are supposed to be doing here in louia you're supposed to be bearing the witness of the light of God that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came onto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them he gave power gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man praise the Lord but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen you may be seated this morning and we trust that the Lord will add the blessing to the reading of the word I would like to title my thought this morning and speak on the word and and this is part two and I would like to take for a subject the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and I just want to add to that and say that the word is still flesh and dwelling amongst us now when we read our Bibles we understand that this book that we call the Bible it it is the very mind the very concept it is the very Eternal thoughts of God himself and it is God's way of making known to us his ways and so if we ever have a question about God if we ever have a question about his ways or his thoughts on a certain subject it's very easy for us to find out what the answer is all we have to do is look in the word I find that we're living in an age where uh we think Google has all of the answers we think that A1 or AI whatever it's called has all the answers but let me tell you something something that is made by man does not have all the answers only God himself has all the answers we see that we're living in a day where AI is like taking over the entire world I just wonder now you know that you can type in certain keywords into Ai and you can type in a subject or whatever you want and they'll bring up a complete subject for you on whatever it is that you're wanting to talk about and I thought my I wonder uh who's going to be the first AI preacher within the message typing in some keywords typing this in and that in and all of a sudden there's a complete sermon that's written out for this Minister and uh for him to preach to the people how important it is for us as ministers to stay Upon Our Knees to get our own Revelation to get our own inspiration that when we come before the people that we have something to give not something that has been written up by some mechanical device but an inspiration of God Almighty because it's the inspiration of God that changes Our Lives it's the inspiration of God that breaks the yolks that breaks the the the chains that have us bound amen you say brother Steven there's no way that's going to happen I guarantee it will you'll get a young man or an old man whoever it may be that really wants to do something for God that really that really uh wishes that he was called to the ministry before we know it uh they have sermons written up for them God help us to have discernment to know when a man is called of God or not to have discernment to know when a man has a a thought that has been sent from God to give to his people cuz understand the thought the uh the sermon that God gives the man is not for the man it's for God's children it's for the needs that's within the assembly amen that was free right now so we see that brother brandham told us that God was this great uh eternal spirit that filled all space and until finally uh brother brandham said it was like that little Ray of sunlight right that little that little Halo that came out of God and and brother brandham said that that was the word of God he said that was the son of God it was the logos in one place he says that that was the uh uh the angel of the Covenant there's many many titles that he gives this but we understand if we could break it down into one thing that it was God Amen it was the concept the very lugus of God and we see that it was not another person within the godhead but it was God himself God beginning to condescend down to his people yet in another form amen so we find out that as he was in this form he began to create according to John chap 1 and verse three it says that all things were made by him and all things were made for for him in one place in the Scripture it says that all things were made by him and for his purpose so we find that whenever God be to create he had a purpose behind what he was saying God is Not uh a god of just of of a lot of words that gets out here and just says a lot of words that have no meaning behind it but God is a very purposeful God that whenever he speaks something he has a plan for that for those words to come to pass and so when God began to create and he said let there be light and let there be this and and let there be this and so on and so forth we find that God had a reason for those things in which he was speaking because he would use all of these things according to his purpose that he had within his mind you and I are no different my brother and my sister God has made us for a reason for a purpose and that is to serve him it's not to just serve the world it's not to just uh make as much money as we can or whatever it may be but he has spoken us here at this very time that we might be a light in a dark place that we might let our lights shine to a dark and dying world Amen so when we look at these things whether it be the things in the natural the trees the birds and the Animals whatever it may be are the things that we do na see the Unseen forces that are around us such as gravity and all the different things that are unseen we find that it all came together for one purpose because God said so nothing came into existence unless God said so and When God Says something we find out that there's nothing that can prevent it from happening why because God God said so follow me with brother Bram 1956 a second-handed robe he says uh go into the room and I knelt down I said I I want to speak to her alone and I go into the room to pray with the woman and while in the room I thought oh God if you'll just show me a vision of what's going to happen to the woman Mr and Miss Wood sitting on the outside waiting to see what the vision would say you see they had all been gotten uh uh so reliant on the visions of God in brother branham's life they were all waiting for a vision but while I was in there I got condemned I was condemned by waiting for a vision seemed like something referred back wasn't the calling what you need a vision when the promise is already been said but they had been so um climatized isn't the right word but they they've been so conditioned by the gift in brother branham's life that that's what they were needing they were needing a vision they were needing an answer for God even brother brandham himself when he's saying the answer already laid within the word hallelujah amen we've been so conditioned even ourselves oh we need someone to lay hands on us we need this to happen we need that to happen no the answer is already written within the word so I knelt down and I pray prayed uh and while praying something just anchored on the inside the faith of the promise my we could preach a sermon on that the faith of the promise cuz God has given to every one of us precious and wonderful promises that's written within his word that we just need to reach out by faith not seeing a vision not something great or whatever no just simple Faith am amen he said I come back out and Miss Wood uh when I told her about it she said did you see anything brother brandom I said I never exactly seen anything but I felt something that told me that his promise was true and he was going to do it and I believe that he's going to do it and in less than 24 hours the end that cancer begin to break away and a scab form over it cancers don't scab as you know unless it's dead so there it was now and the woman is healed and home what a wonderful Christ by keeping our eyes on the promise God said so what good advice that is for us at the end of a year going into another year keeping our eyes on the Promises of God why because God said so the man didn't say so not because the preacher said so but because God said soise God and he says uh keep your eye in the promise God said so that settles it that's all of it if God said so God is able to keep his promise or he would never make it because he is not a God that will lie if God makes a promise to US Written within his word guess what God is going to keep that promise 25 years stood on the impossible because he counted God was able to perform what he had promised amen and we are the children of Abraham God said so he's written it within his word great and precious promises what is it God said so people ask us and they say well why is it that your wife dresses it the way she does and the people within your church and I don't know if you've ever looked up the reviews on our church on uh on Google might the Google thing you know and you can look up reviews and you can see what people say when they come to visit and everything and there was one person and they it they wrote from what I remember oh it's a nice church but you know the women they they all wear skirts and the women they they all wear Cardigans and they all have long hair and I look out and I see you know 80% of the women wearing Cardigans it's a true review maybe we need to turn the air down a little bit or maybe it's because we have some kind of Revelation of God's word that we say ah I have an answer for you there's a reason why the the the sisters and the women and our wives in the church dressed like this because God said so he didn't necessarily say that we should wear Cardigans but he did say that a woman should dress in modest apparel he did say that it was an Abomination for a woman to put on a garment to pertains to a man and vice versa sometimes times we leave that out for us guys don't we why why do they have such long hair because God said so that's right amen First Corinthians we can read it where the woman's hair was given to her as a covering not just some little hat that's not her covering but it's her hair and not only is it given for a covering but has given to her for her glory amen it's a glorious thing yes for a woman not to trim her hair because that word Glory it is a form of worship yes it's not some Creed that's been given by man it's not some man-made idea where brother brandom and and and and the the Holiness movement was trying to uh put their their hands uh uh upon the women like this and tell them what to do no no no no no come on it's a reev ation of the word of God that God said so it's good enough that's good enough for me it's good enough for brother Dave is it good enough for you and so when someone asks you a question and they say why do you do what you do the simple response is because God said so and that Saddles it some might say that that's a a little bit oldfashioned it's a little bit oldfashioned that the guys are all clean cut and this and that and the women and this and that I tend to disagree that it's old-fashioned because God cannot become oldfashioned God is not oldfashioned but I want to tell you that God is always in fashion because he is always present he is the god of the I am he is the god of the now and so if he is ever present he is is always in fashion amen God is a fashion maker I want to ask you this morning whose fashion are you following are you following the fashion of the world or are you following God's fashion I want to follow the fashion of God am whether the world thinks it's cool or not amen so we see that when we walk by faith we're not walking by faith as blind people faith is not walking blindly faith is not walking with your head in the ground and saying well perhaps it might happen but perhaps it may not happen that is not Faith but brother brandham says it uh this way that faith is bold y faith is a revelation and so when we have a revelation of something that's written within the word we don't have to shy away from it we don't have to uh think well maybe it will or maybe it won't but when God gives it to you you can walk with an assurance because God said so it's been revealed to your heart so what do we do then we just keep walking we don't have to be wandering and waiting we can just say father I believe it's true you said so that settles it therefore I'm going to continue walking until the promise comes to [Applause] pass that's what we been doing we've been walking by faith they've been talking about the coming of the Lord since the days of Paul oh he hasn't come yet oh he's come and you've already missed it nonsense so just because he hasn't come yet does that mean he's not going to come it just means when he does come oh how sweet it's going to be that's right I'm reminded of that story of brother br him and he tells of the lady and uh and the guy promised her he said I'll be back huh you remember the story you remember and everybody made fun of her and she prepared and she got ready you know weddings are the most glorious stressful uh days of people's lives you can't I can't wait until I got married and in the week of the marriage I can't wait until this is over with why because we get so caught up in the small details we get so caught up in this and so caught up in that when we forget to enjoy the moment Bethany and Nick you're next enjoy the moment don't get all stressed out about things that's how it is with God guess what but it's a type where we're we get so uh uh stressed because we want to prepare and we want to prepare right God has given us a word amen that we don't have to stress out over it all we got to do is believe it and say father I'm clothing myself in it and I'm preparing myself though she was tased though she though people said oh he never promised to you we never seen it happen we've never seen this guy before that's the world it doesn't matter what they say all that matters is what you believe in your heart and God has revealed to you that one day he is coming it might be 50 years it might be a hundred years and it might be tomorrow but I'm going to live my life every day as if he's coming today or tomorrow amen God said so and that settles it it's kind of interesting we're all telling our pastor brother on you need to rest up you need to rest get some rest and get your strength back I want to speak to Ruth here this morning what is your final part of your ministry resting you need to rest loud AIA has got you so much in turmoil it's got you so stressed out worried about money worried about work worried about family worried about this worried about wars worried about the president hey it isn't our job to worry about these things the worrying should be over because we've moved to our final resting place and that's resting in the promises of God that's tell yourself I'm resting I'm not going to get caught up and Loud anymore why because I'm resting in him very good amen hallelujah remember that tonight 10 minutes after midnight as you're driving home I'm resting in his promises amen 2024 I'm going to rest in him 2024 I'm going to give more to God 2024 I'm not going to stress out about the ifs wats or butts but I'm going to trust in God Almighty amen amen so we find when we read the Old Testament that it is a sh of the New Testament the voice of the sign 1964 brother Bram says I'm a typologist certainly I have no education I have to look back and see what he did do and we are taught that the Old Testament was a shadow of things that is to come so if I looked here and never seen my hand and I seen the shadow of my hand and I had five fingers I'd have some good idea that when my hand got there I had five fingers so what happened to them was examples of of how God does things the way he does it now so we find out that our Old Testament scripture cuz remember we're talking about the word and so the word in the Old Testament it was a shadow of things that was to come it wasn't just the history of Israel or the life stories of David and all these different men that we can read about but it's a shadow of something that was to come and be fulfilled at a certain time now brother brandham says if I see my shadow and I never see my hand if you guys could see my the shadow of my hand here it looks just like my hand but the further away the shadow is the fuzzier the image is right so I could look at it way up here and two fingers if I was the size of brother Robert it would be fuzzier and fuzzier right but for me it looks pretty plain cuz I got short arms but it's right here and as I look at it it's pretty it's pretty fuzzy but as the image becomes closer and closer you find out that the image of the Shadow now it becomes more clear and more clear so we find out within the Old Testament that it was a shadow of the coming Messiah whether we look at the life of David we can see David uh a a rejected King and here he was rejected and he was chased off from his son and the different ones that rebelled against him and he was a shadow of a rejected King that was to come he was a type of Christ who would sit on the Mount of Olives a rejected King and weep over Israel we can look at the different things the different uh uh sacrifices and and how they did things and that there had to be a a shedding of blood for the cover Ing and the remission of sins it was all speaking of something that was to come in the near future and the closer that the image God because understand that God didn't stay as a lugos he didn't stay as a God that we didn't understand but he became to condescend and condescend and he would reveal himself through prophets until finally it came to a time where the image and the shadow now become one and the things that the image that the shadow was portraying we could now see the image that all wound up in Jesus Christ everything of the Old Testament speaks of Christ that's why brother brandham could say Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament was speaking of things to come so it's important for us to understand when we read our Old Testament that we don't just just read it as a story we don't just read it as the life of somebody that lived no there's something that's written within there that's a type or a shadow of something that was to come and if you look closely you'll see yourself within the Old Testament whether it's with Ruth whether it's with Esther whe whoever it may be you can look closely and say that's me Hallelujah now we find out that the shadow came into a reality and the reason why it was coming into a reality was that God was wanting to make himself known but God was not just wanting to make himself known to everybody but he had a certain group in mind that he would make himself personally known ownn too the Bible says in uh John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but they'll have everlasting life a prophet comes along and he says that scripture is not for everyone that's right but it's only for those who have been predestinated for ordained before the foundations of the world to believe it that's that's that's you amen you know that you didn't become seed when you become reborn right that's right didn't change anything just changed your nature but you were reborn because you were already seed my goodness when you get a revelation of a new birth when you get a revelation that this guy right here is not who you are when brother brandham got the Revelation he says uh uh I I realized that I'm not the son of Charles brandham right he tried to be the son of Charles brandham he was a family of drunkards his family didn't have a a very good name amongst the people and so one day guess what he tried to do he tried to be just like his daddy come on ah give me a drink of that I'll drink it I'm a brandom I'm your son watch me drink it Bill's a he can't even drink that I'm a brandom I can smoke a cigarette I'm a brandom he tried to live his life as a brandom before he knew exactly who he was and guess what it never worked out for him right amen what about those boys that beat him up that one time he went and he got his gun loaded that thing up which one one of you boys wants to die first come on he meant it you know why because he was living as a son of Charles brandham he said Brams they're all drunkers they all died with their boots on you know what that means they're all fighters they're all drunkers they all they either they either died if somebody else killed them or whatever it was right and for a while that's who he resonated with the brandom family was who he was the brandom family was was was his identity I'm a brandom people hate me because I'm a brandom right people cross the road because they don't want to be seen walking next to her brandom they don't want to shake my hand that that's who I am that's who my family is there nobody likes me but he came to a time in his life where he realized yeah this isn't who I am thank you Lord so in other words I don't have to act like my dad amen because I have a heavenly father who teaches me the right ways to live my life I have a heavenly father who leads me and who guides me uh saint of God that's where we need to come to we need to come to a place where we stop using our family name as excuses in our lives where we stop using well this is how my dad was this is how my family was I'm a McNeely this is just who I am nonsense the blood of Jesus Christ if you will let it will cleanse us of all our family insecurities I'm like this because my family is like this no who are you anyways is that who you really are or are you a child of the king so because we are children of God now we live and act as children of God I'm reminded of the story of uh of the slave I've been thinking about that story a lot and I realized that uh you know the story he was for he was a slave he had been bought I want to and and if this if this doesn't quite match up with your way of thinking you can just spit out the the seed okay you know that they don't have seedless fruit in fonat true I learned I learned that the hard way I went to preach on it and they're all looking at me seedless fruit never heard of it had to change my subject on the [Laughter] fly but here he was this slave and and and and and you know the discussion that the master I want that guy well why did he want that guy because he was the hardest worker he held himself with dignity it didn't matter where he was in his uh geographical location he still presented himself of who he was and where he came from because it was he was representing Hallelujah he was representing his father there that was a king in a different country I wanted him now not for sale do you feed him different no I don't feed him different he's the same as everybody else uh do you clothe them different does he sleep different no no no he's he's he gets the same treatment as everybody else understand that God does not take us out of the world but he keeps us while we're in the world but I got to thinking about it and he says so this guy is having a conversation with the master with his slave master not he's not for sale he's mine why was he mine because he was bought with a price am he belongs to me amen He's Mine He's not for sale understand that that's when Satan comes and and comes before God to you and he says this guy let me have me he says no he's not for Saleen why can't I have him because he's been bought with a price you Lord you can never be lost if you're saved amen if you've been bought by the blood of Jesus Christ it doesn't matter how much you blackslide how many years you backslide you are still [Applause] godsall no he's not for sale why he's mine and I've paid a price for him and I'm not letting him go amen I liked that amen so sometimes God reveals himself and he does it in unexpected ways right at unexpected times and a lot of times for us as Believers it's a way that we don't fully understand it's a way that is against the human reasoning of our minds the unchangeable god working in an unexpectable way 1962 take a hold of God's promise say God you promised to save me he says hold on to it stay right there till you're saved God you promised to fill me with the Holy Ghost stay right there till you're filled with the Holy Ghost what is he saying he's saying don't fear off to the left or to the right but if God has made a promise just stay with the promise until it's fulfilled in our lives he says you promis to heal me I'm staying right here till you heal me there you are that's the way to to do it stay with it am it doesn't matter how long it takes stay with it that's the way to do it yes he says God is infinite he is unchangeable he cannot change and he does it in unexpected ways but hold on to hold on till it comes don't tell God [Applause] what right don't tell God what don't tell God how you want it to be performed don't tell God when you want it to be performed don't tell God how don't tell him anything just tell him I'm here and I'm willing and I'm able and I'm ready Lord to accept it am stay right there with it how you want him to do it he will do it the way you want him to do it it's not what he said he will do it the way he wants to do it am don't tell him how to do it good my so many times yes we have petitions before God and we say father this is what I would like and and I want to be saved I want my children to be saved I want this to happen I I want that to happen and so much of the time we have a preconceived idea of how it's going to happen but when we have that preconceived idea guess what happens it never happens according to your thoughts that's right so just let God be God Amen in your life yes let God be the answer to your prayer by bringing it to pass hallelujah amen these are all just little golden nuggets that can really help us in our lives aren't they so when the Jehovah of the Old Testament became flesh and he dwelt in a human body a human form it was a very mysterious thing to the people of that day they didn't understand that how Jehovah God would dwell within a man they knew that God would use man and God would speak through man but they never could quite understand it God himself that great Eternal all knowing Spirit would actually dwell within the heart and the life and form of man now if they would have known this shadow of the Old Testament with Ruth and Boaz as a kinsman redeemer they would have realized that because man fell in the flesh that God would have to come in the flesh to redeem man to be his near Kinsman right but they missed the shadow yeah it was just a story that they read they missed the types how important it is for us to catch those things so we see that whenever the word of God materializes or becomes flesh it's it's a mysterious thing to the people and when it becomes flesh there's three things that I believe happens it causes a great attraction amongst the people it attracts the seed of God and it attracts the nonseed of God nevertheless it is an attraction that attracts all kinds of people remember brother brandham said that uh when the when the gospel net is cast that it catches all kinds of fish it catches all kinds of creatures all all kinds of living beings that live within the water but out of that that that that multitude of cats there might be only a few predestinated seed that's within the net we all know that so we see that when the word materializes when the word comes to pass it causes an attraction the next thing that it causes is a separation and the next thing that it brings is a persecution it attracts the people but when it attracts the people that it's supposed to attract it causes a separation within those people and when it separates the people we're going to get into this and I'll use scriptures when it C when it brings the separation the last thing it brings is a persecution Now understand we we know that the mystery of this hour is Christ in you the hope of glory so when I use these examples of an attraction a separation and a persecution and I use the example of Jesus and I use the example of brother brandom I don't want you to stop there because I'm not just talking of Jesus or brother brandom but I'm talking about your life I'm talking about who you are as a son or a daughter of God that whenever these stages come in your life there's an attraction there's a separation and a persecution you can realize wow I'm right in line with the scriptures I'm right in line with the life of brother brandom I'm right in in line with the Life of Christ amen hallelujah it's a mysterious thing so we see that when Jesus was born it caused a great attraction the wise men came and said where is he that is born King of the Jews where is he at they run through the town they were they were they had a a deep revelation of what was going on in this hour they had followed the star that they' done these different things there was an attraction that was going on what was happening the the word that was becoming flesh was now attracting the people it brought an attraction of these men to come and worship the young baby but it also attracted somebody else it attracted the king of that day as he heard the word he said my a king of the Jews isra in up well I'm the king of the Jews the attraction it attracted him but it attracted him to act and respond in a different way it didn't bring a worship to the newborn babe that was that that was there but it brought a a declaration that every child of three years and younger a male child should be slain and killed there was a great attraction but it attracted one to love life and worship and it attracted one to judgment and to death hallelujah what was it that made him do this this King it was jealousy you find out saints of God that sometimes people are going to be jealous of you and they're not going to know why but it's because they're yielding to the wrong things amen don't let jealousy amen don't let a root of jealousy come up in your heart don't be jealous of one another but rather be happy one for the other amen amen amen the same attraction it brought one to life and one to death the man you remember the scripture the man that was born blind and Jesus gave gave back his sight it it caused a a great attraction amongst the people not only to his family but to his neighbors and and you can read the scripture there in St John 9 where where where this man that was born blind and and and and Jesus gives back his sight and all of a sudden there's a great attraction amongst the people they said isn't this the man that was born blind isn't this him that that we've known for all all these years and and we know his family and and and we've been his neighbors but how is it that all of a sudden he can see how is it all of a sudden that he's not blind no more but but but but he's been given back his sight what a great attraction let's read it John 9 I'll read a few verses here 30 through 33 notice how he responds to this miracle the man answered and said unto them talking to the Pharisees why herein is a marvelous thing that you that ye know not from whence he is and yet he ha opened mine eyes now we know that God heareth not Sinners but if any man be a worshipper of God and doeth His will him he heareth since the world began was not it heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was blind if this man were not of God he could do nothing amen and you find out when you read the rest of the story that Jesus because he didn't know who he was Jesus healed him opened his eyes and and then just went about his ways and then Jesus crossed path with this man because all of a sudden the Pharisees got angry they got upset they said who are you a man who was born in sin because because they said because he was blind that he was born in sin who are you to tell us and who are you to teach us of the things of God and they cast him and his family out you remember the story so Jesus crosses path with this guy and Jesus says uh uh do you believe in the Son of God he says who is he Lord that I might believe in him he says I'm the one that's talking to you the same attraction the same Miracle it brought one to life but yet the response of the other one it brought them to judgment and death why because they were looking at the wrong thing amen Pharisees were looking through eyes of jealousy why was it that they could never support him why was it that they could never get behind Jesus because he was taken away from their their Glory he was doing things he was speaking with authority he was speaking with an authority that the scribes did not have and the people were noticing it so the one thing that they could do hey we got to get rid of this man let's get him out of here why because he's taken away from us they were jealous how easy it is for ministers they get jealous one of another amen get a minister to preach a real good sermon all of a sudden the other ministers are all jealous well I don't know yeah he said this but he should have said that no come on get behind him support him say Well done God bless you I humbled myself to Brother Steve clar at the wedding reception here the other day I said brother Steve phenomenal service Wednesday night very very very good whole service man he's stepping all over my toes I said brother Steve and I fought with it I'll be honest I said brother Steve remember you said that someone was praying and it changed your uh uh changed your sermon and what you were going to speak on he said yeah I said well perhaps I wasn't praying enough and God changed your sermon title to speak directly to me I receive it amen God help us how easy it is to get caught up with life how easy it is to get off to the left or off to the right I say father keep us in this straight and narrow and when you correct us with the hand of love a love of Correction Lord let me receive it I receive it Lord we notice that these the Pharisees and the man that was born blind they both saw the same attraction sure but they had a different reaction the resurrection of Lazarus caused a great attraction John 12:9 and 10 and much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there speaking of Lazarus and they came not for jesus' sake only but that they might see Lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead wow what a great attraction this miracle was it wasn't just an attraction for the family but all of the people who were roundabout and involved and knew of his death hey guess what they wanted to see this man that was dead for 4 days and now was alive again notice the reaction of the Pharisees but the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death they're trying to squish his ministry I want you to be thinking now remember of Jesus of brother brandham and yourself put yourself in the situation they saw the same attraction but it brought a different reaction the Pharisees and Sadducees they say the the they saw the same things that that they were attracted to but they saw something different than the woman at the wh when the woman at the well had her heart discerned what happened she said uh I know that when the Messiah cometh he's going to tell us these he's going to do these things and tell us these things and he said I am he who speaks to thee oh my she dropped her water pot she dropped all her things she run into the town and she said come and see a man he's shown me and he's told me all things isn't this the Christ and because of her testimony right yes an unclean woman who had many husbands and the one that she was living with wasn't even her husband a woman that couldn't fetch water at the same time as the rest of the women come on when she met Jesus understand things changed it when she met with her true husband amen guess what happened her testimony changed yes her life changed and she wasn't seen anymore as that woman that's right Hallelujah when God meets with a sinner onen how dare we look at that person as a sinner because we were all born in sin and shaped in iniquity amen and so when God does something in someone's life we need to look at them now as a son or a daughter of God and listen to their testimony because things change when people meet Jesus Hallelujah she said this is the Messiah but when he did the same things with the with the Sadducees and Pharisees they said this is Bey Bob he's a he he casts out Devils by the spirit of the devil same attraction different reaction the Bible talks about how many multitudes would follow Jesus and they would throng him and they would want to touch him because virtue would go out of him and and he would feed the 5,000 and feed the 7,000 and and do this miracle and do that miracle and it was a great great attraction that was bringing the people towards him of both seed and nonseed but with the same attractions there was different reactions amongst the people that's right begs the question we need to ask is why were they following him then why were there multitudes that was following him I believe that some were were following him for their own gain something that they could get from him something that they needed prayed for something they needed a touch they they needed their lives changed it was it was a personal gain it it wasn't because they had a revelation of of who he was it wasn't because they had a revelation that God was fulfilling his word that this was Emanuel born in flesh dwelling amongst us no they had different reasons some it was for because they wanted what he had to offer for some it was the big thing that was trending in Jerusalem in that day notice everybody's you ever notice people they change their ideas on things and they decorate their house and they do this and they do that and this is cool today and but it's not cool tomorrow because they're caught up with what's trending huh what's trending today I want to be trendy I want to be cool so they're always changing how they look and how they do things that's how it was with them in that day because multitudes will gather multitudes you'll find that there will be people come to church they'll see all the cars outside and they'll think my it's a big church it must be wonderful it must be good and and they're attracted to it because of the numbers but when they come if all you're looking for is numbers you're looking for the wrong thing because when the word brings a correction in our lives guess what you're going to beat it out there real early why because you're coming for the wrong reason but when we come to church not because of the numbers but because you want God to speak to your heart through the ministering of the word it doesn't matter if there's a correction that comes or not you're going to stay there because the word is what you're wanting praise the Lord and we find that there was some there that were following his ministry and the attraction not because they understood everything that's right not because they knew exactly who who he was not because they knew exactly his ministry and they were able to explain it and everything but they knew that God was doing something in their midst and I believe hey I can put myself there I remember when I first heard of the message serpent seed and I got the little uh uh you remember the little pamphlet original sin and I got that thing and uh and I I pretty much my first Bible first message study I ever did first came to the Lord and I and uh I said well I'm going to let my mom and dad have it see what they say about this get that thing and cuz I would invite them to church they wouldn't come and I would invite them and I would invite them and they wouldn't come then finally my mom came and she'd go uh I said well how was the service mom oh it was nice son yeah the music was real nice the singing was nice and the singing was not nice you get a bunch of European men trying to sing How Great Is Our God it just those of you that have visited European churches you understand it's nice but it's not that nice and so finally I had enough I said you know what I want to let them have it and I got that thing A4 piece of paper and I wrote that thing out and I said I'm going to let them see this and see what they think of this serpent seed how about that get it and I give it to my mom to read first cuz my mom is a better reader than my dad you know I I kind of take after my dad a little bit and so my mom reads it she goes yeah okay well I guess that makes sense son and give it to my dad you know 20 minutes later he's he has it red yeah yeah makes complete sense here I am wanting an argument with my family huh it didn't happen well guess what when you're seed you can't help but see it we don't understand it all when we first came to Christ when we first heard about this message and guess what we don't understand it all right now but I can say from the bottom of my heart I believe it with all my heart and I love the Lord with all my heart and I am convinced that this message is the truth whether I can explain it or understand it all or not has nothing to do with it the Lord we find that they all had different motives and objectives for being attracted to the ministry but only the bride of Christ will stay with the word because the bride of Christ is the only one that can bring the word into full manifestation amen we see that brother bram's Ministry it began just like Jesus's Ministry first and second pull hey great multitudes followed his ministry he would get to invite he would be invited to preach over here and over there and he was a great man of God as as long as he was having prayer lines and as long as he was Discerning the hearts of the people and everybody loved him there was a great attraction that was that was following his ministry but understand in that great attraction it was attracting seed and it was attracting nonseed it was attracting those that were that were following his ministry for their own gain there was those that were following his ministry because he had a great name and they wanted to be associated with that name and then there was ones following his ministry just because it was the trendy thing to do in the 40s 50s is to go to all the healing revivals and see what God was going to do someone go to go to those revivals something in their hearts I'm gonna prove it wrong I'm going to catch him I'm going to see brother brandom says in a certain place he says when the angel of the Lord speaks it can not happen amen why because it's God says a man's word will fail but his words will never fail praise the Lord we find that many were following him for different reasons but God doesn't care about those who are following for uh motives and objectives that aren't quite correct God doesn't care about those that are following because it's the trendy thing to do the only thing that God cares about is attracting that rainbow trout the only thing that God cares about is attracting the seed of God to to what he's doing in that hour amen because remember when the gospel net is cast it catches all kinds of fish hallelujah amen so we see then that there was a great attraction in his ministry put yourself now let me just talk about you for a few seconds what about you you attract many people in your life do you know that by the way that you live and act and speak the way you present yourself guess what it's an attraction to the people of Luda amen but it's going to attract all kinds of people and all kinds of people are going to be attracted for different reasons some are going to be attracted because of what you have to offer some are going to be attracted because you have some kind of good personality that they like being around and you know what when you stop offering offering out what they want chances are you won't be an attraction in their lives anymore but don't let that stop you from fishing don't let that stop you from being salty and attracting people to your lives because at some point you will attract the right kind of person you will attract a person that'll come to church and be caught by the word keep fishing my brother and my sister sister you know you young girls that you can go fishing you know that you can be salty you know that you don't have to preach a sermon in order to be an attraction for somebody to come and hear the word come on no all you got to do is be yourself cuz we're already so different than the people of louia that they'll be attracted to say hey something different about you amen what is it that you believe and if somebody comes and they hear the word and they're offended and they leave guess what it's not your fault that's right what is it you are an attraction but the word brought a separation good so let's get into the separation now I know you're all tired but I got started late okay I didn't come to the pulpit till 11:00 stay with me so now the word when it is made flesh or manifested it also produces a separation when Jesus began to preach to them the Beatitudes and things what was he doing he was separating them from the Flesh and from sin he's saying yeah your law says this but I'm going to tell you this and and this is he was giving to them a higher standard in how to live their life not a standard of law but it was now turning to a standard of Grace so he was because there was an attraction came Now understand when the attraction came it attracted everybody can we agree with that but when the word began to be preached the attraction now was causing a separation but it wasn't separating everybody all at once from the attraction because people still held on to the attraction amen understand that God wants you and I to be separated from the things of this world and there's one thing that's going to separate us and that's the word of God so he began to preach the Beatitudes and these different things and we realized that he came to a place in his ministry hey he had he had a bunch of people following him he had 70 that he had already sent out and they were doing different Miracles and casting out devils and they were making a way for him to come into that City but he realized that the attraction was still very strong they were still attracted by The Miracles and the signs of his life and so now he comes to a place in his life and he says unless you drink the blood and hate the Flesh of the son of man you have no part in me he dropped the mic and he walked off the platform mic dropped right everybody was bewilder this is a hard saying how can we how can we do this how can we drink his blood how can we eat his flesh the Bible says that many more follow many followed with him no more right so no doubt the disciples they were shooken shaking wow this great ministry seems like it's falling apart what's going on listen God said so God had a plan he says are you going to go also are you offended in this are you offended in this word or you are you offended by the revealed word of the hour are you scared to say that you believe that God sent a prophet are you scared to say that you believe the Seven Seals have been been ripped off this book that your Bible has become a new book saints of God I am not ashamed of this gospel I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ or the work that God has done in this hour don't be scared to sh share it amen even though you have a great attraction in your life of people give them the word test Hallelujah that's what brother brandom said give them the word test and you'll find out whether they're attracted to you for the right reasons or not amen so true why did those 12 walk away because their motives and their objectives were wrong but there was 12 that were there with him they didn't understand at all perhaps they couldn't explain what he had just said and Peter said Lord where can we go and I say this morning Lord where are we going to go am I going to go back to denomination are we going to go back into the world it doesn't solve anything it just makes your life a misery you know sometimes the world will will give you a uh uh what's it called uh momentary satisfaction you know why because it's satisfying your flesh right that's right all this feels good little bit of sin feels good to get out and let my hair down feels good to get out here with the boys and and do whatever I want yeah it's cool I'm cool at school cool at work momentary satisfaction many of you guys want to give a momentary satisfaction to sin and ruin your testimony hardest thing to ever do is to come back oh yeah because if you're a seat of God guess what you will come back amen it's just a fact God just sets the drag oh there he goes again he's running again yeah okay enough is enough I'm bringing you in momentary satisfaction how many of you want a little piece of the world for momentary satisfaction think about it because it never satisfies the soul it never satisfies the seed that lays within you so let me just tell you all momentary satisfaction disappears that's right but when you serve God with all your heart whether you have mistakes or not guess what you are satisfied right amen because that's who you really are that's good I wonder who the next person is going to be I feel like stand with it 2024 you say I've had enough just for the moment I want to let my hair down and find out who I am I want to find out what it's like to live outside a church let me tell you something that's disgusting amen it's evil it's nasty and sin will hold you longer than you ever thought possible all because you weren't yielding to the things of God when you were in church my brother and my sister don't ruin your testimony for a momentary satisfaction yes help us hallelujah because it's but for a moment amen it fades away those people that were attracted to you hey guess what they'll leave you yes they can care less you think people in church don't care try having friends of the world ah yeah they seem good for a while I've been there true I've been there it's not a nice place then where do you go right where do you go from that point did didn't work out in church it's not working out in the world yeah I got no other choice you got a choice all right Jesus Christ there will be people here that welcome you with open arms amen amen I wonder wonder what's on your mind this morning I wonder were you excited to come to church or what's in your heart wonder what thoughts you've had in your heart this morning let me speak to that heart and say that God loves you so much amen why would God take a minister I'm place his burden so heavy on my heart right now I know why cuz one of you is pulling it this way one of you have already made up your mind and in 2024 you're done some of you have already decided that this is your last church [Music] service let the Holy Spirit he's quickening to your your heart right now cuz there's no way that he'll move on my heart and he's not moving on your heart as the musicians come saints of God there's a great big God for you and there's a great big God that wants to meet your needs there's a great big God that wants to share his love with you but there's a great there's a devil that wants to take it all away from you there's a devil that's been robbing your joy there is a devil that's been robbing your peace there is a devil that's been stealing the Salvation that you once loved so much away from your heart and you need to acknowledge it this morning and realize what's going on in your life that devil that tells you that no one cares is a liar that's right that devil that tells you that you're better off out in the world let me tell you he's a liar that devil is telling you that it's not worth it that you're done and packing up your bags is a liar yes there's a devil to shame and a God to gain yes amen let's pray father Lord you know you know you know who it is you know where they're at and father God We're Just Fishing a little deeper this morning
