Oh, it's only you I am safe. Oh Lord, it's only you I'm secure. Oh, it's only you I find peace. So cover me, Lord. Cover me. Oh, cover me when I'm not hurting. And cover me when I'm not strong. Cover me when I go through the storm. Oh, cover me when all things hopeless and cover me when my faith is gone. Let the peace that passes all I understand will cover me. [Music] Oh cover me. Amen. Welcome you to the Wednesday night service. Looking forward what the Lord has put on our pastor's heart tonight. If we could sing the old rugged cross. Oh, on a hill far away there stood an old rugged cross the love of suffering and shame. When I love that old cross, where the dearest demon world of sin was slain, raise your hand if you cherish that old rugged cross. Oh, I cherish the old rug and cross. Oh, still my trophies at last I lay down. For I will cling to the old rug. [Music] Oh, and exchange something for the ground. Holy old rugged cross so despised by the world has wonderous attraction to me. For the dear lamb of God, he left his glory above. Oh, to bear it on your calary. Oh, so I'll cherish the rugged cross. Oh, till my trophies at last I lay down. Oh, I will cling to the rug cross and exchange his own name for a crown. Let's sing verse three. Oh to the old cross I will ever be true. His shame and reproach gladly bear. [Music] Oh he call me someday. Oh to my home far away where is glory forever I'll share. So I'll cherish [Music] the old rugged cross. Oh, till my trophies at last I lay down. Oh, I will [Music] [Applause] rug it and exchange it for a while. Amen. Thankful for that old rugged cross. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Jesse Love, if you'll prepare to take the knees before the Lord as we read them. We have uh three three prayer requests tonight. Sister Nancy Tempy says, "Please pray for their friend John from Pennsylvania. He's developed Limes disease." So, I pray that the Lord be with him. Please be with Sister Maddie McGary. She's at home not feeling well either. And then brother Brian says tonight, "Please pray for sister Sarah, sister Sarah's mom. She has been really sick the last week and we pray that the Lord will touch her in a mighty way." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Jesse, if you'll come. [Music] Let's pray. Dear Lord Jesus, Father, as we come to this evening, Lord, Father, we hold these prayer requests in our hands, Father. Lord, they were asked from a sincere heart, Lord, to Lord, we have needs, Father. And Lord, we're crying out to you for our needs.

Um, just letting you know that brother Danny Delmundo from the Philippines will be speaking for us this coming Sunday. The following Sunday, Brother Steve Lar will be here preaching for us. Uh uh I'm going to be taking my wife away for a little bit of a holiday and uh take her alone and just get away. We need a little time. So we're going to be doing that and uh uh so be praying for us.

It's my first time to US. &gt;&gt; Hello, my name is Joanna and I'm also from Poland. So, most of us are from Poland, not from Serbia, but we're really happy that we can be here and meet all of you. And thank you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you. We welcome you. We're glad you're here. And I've been to Poland many times. You probably weren't even born by the last time I was there in Poland. But anyway, we welcome you and we ask you to send our love and greetings back to the saints in Poland and in Serbia. Okay, God bless you. Give him a another big hand. I thank God for my technicians. They see I don't have my microphone on, they come up. Uh you'd think after all these years I'd have it down. You'd think I would, but uh so praise the Lord. God is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um so listen, I've been covering this this um topic about spiritual warfare and talking about war and everything. And I want all of you to understand that that even now I'll probably take another couple services on this. I don't know uh exactly how long it'll be, but I want you all of you to understand this that you are going to face your enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to be in a contest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if you've been raised in the message, doesn't matter uh your background in a message church, etc., etc. You will &gt;&gt; have a contest. There will be a battle. And unless you understand spiritual warfare, you can become a casualty. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we'll see. You know, Brother Bram said, "Look at the scrap heaps of ministers." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That hit the ditch on the left or the right because they don't go about it correctly. And so, we know that uh uh these things are real. And brother Brennham talks about demonology. Let's all stand. Sing Amazing Grace. It's amazing grace that God has brought you to where you are. It will be grace to take you home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody said Chris Klayville is here. Where is he? Brother Chris, one of our old buddies from here. Welcome home. It's good to have you here, Brother Chris. We miss you guys. Love and greetings. Your family here tonight, too. &gt;&gt; God bless you. It's good to have you all here. Come back and put your feet under the table. Let's sing Amazing Grace. Amazing grace, how sweet [Music] that a rich like me. I once was lost, but now I'm blind. But now I through many dangers, talls and snares, through many dangerous. [Music] I have already come. His grace that brought he saved us. Oh, and grace will lead me home. Heavenly Father, as we come to you this evening, humbling ourselves before you &gt;&gt; and we're asking you, Father, once again, would you come and walk among us, Father? Take the holy scriptures, &gt;&gt; and open our eyes of understanding, Father. I pray that you will help us to know the gravity of the hour, the situation in which we are in and how the gross darkness is upon the people. And but there is a light about the evening time. We thank you that you have sent to us that light called the message of the hour, the word of God revealed in its season. We thank you for that. Father, I pray that you will help us to be patient and understanding even as I go over some of these topics because Father, teaching is a different ministry than than preaching. So, I pray that you will help our saints as we go over these things. I pray, Father, give me uh wisdom and discernment. And I pray that you will just bless your people tonight as we study your word. We thank you. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank you, musicians. Appreciate it. Uh let's go in our Bibles, please. 2 Corinthians chapter 2. Then we'll go to 2 Corinthians 10. And then we'll go to 1 Timothy 1. Now when we talk about spiritual warfare, I want you to understand that even the Bible says that Jesus said, "I did not come to bring peace." &gt;&gt; But I came to bring division. &gt;&gt; And even it says that some of those of your own household &gt;&gt; will be of your worst enemies. That's what Jesus said. And he who loves father or mother, sister or brother more than they love me is not worthy of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's a pretty sharp uh straight and narrow message, is that not? &gt;&gt; So we have to understand, let our hearts be drawn towards him. &gt;&gt; Okay. And God has given you children and a family and praise God for that. God re asks you to raise them up in the stature and and nurture of God that they might understand God. Now, they don't catch things until they get a little bit older because they're immature &gt;&gt; because they don't understand. But if you'll raise them up right and if you'll appeal to their heart rather than their head because you know most of them are are are just uh you know when I was a child I spake as a child understood as a child. &gt;&gt; Amen. So have grace and patience with them and and remember daddies that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. &gt;&gt; So even the Bible says the way that you deal with your son and correct him, God will do the same with you. &gt;&gt; So God help us to be patient one with another and we uh be patient and understand. 2 Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11. Lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want him to take advantage. &gt;&gt; This is his Eden. He has taken 6,000 years to perfect it. &gt;&gt; He's perfected sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the utopia for unbelief and sin. &gt;&gt; And it comes through the &gt;&gt; tree of knowledge. That's why everything that's why young people listen if we don't counterbalance &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; what the government forces you to have your children in school &gt;&gt; if we don't counterbalance that you'll become imbalanced &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; if you're not careful and you lose your equilibrium and get into college or something you're gone &gt;&gt; tree of knowledge &gt;&gt; eat you up &gt;&gt; but if you have a balance &gt;&gt; then you can stand the tests of of the enemy. 2 Corinthians 10. 2 Corinthians chap 10:es 3-5. For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds. And I will be talking a little bit about what strongholds are in believers lives. &gt;&gt; How does a stronghold happen? How does the enemy come in? How does he take advantage of you? &gt;&gt; If you are ignorant and you don't study these things in spiritual warfare, brother Bram said, you can take an evil spirit and not even know it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he just gets you off. He gets you to We're going to go through some of this stuff about strongholds and we're going to talk about uh these five gates to the spirit of man. You have five flesh gates to the outer court, five to the inner court, but you only have two gates that go to the soul. That's either faith or unbelief. &gt;&gt; So, and it isn't until faith, revelation is struck the heart of the person. You say, "Lord, come into my heart. Oh Lord, uh I have hid thy word in my heart that I learn not to sin against you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And so um look at this now. So that they are mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds, casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exaltth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Timothy 1. If you would turn back in your Bibles, 1 Timothy 1:es 18- 20. This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare. So listen, prophecies have gone before. He's uh he's got an understanding that he's being called of God and everything. But look that I want you to understand these things that you might war a good warfare. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you're entering a battle. Y &gt;&gt; holding faith and a good conscience which have which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck. &gt;&gt; Do you know any shipwrecks within the message? &gt;&gt; Do you know some that have given up the faith &gt;&gt; and they've made shipwreck? &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's not pretty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not. &gt;&gt; Of whom is Himenius. Now here Paul mentions men's name. They were part of the early church. Of whom is Himenius and Alexander whom I have delivered unto Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme. May God bless the reading of his word. You can be seated this evening in the presence of God. All right. I want to talk this evening on entitle my sermon spiritual warfare in Laiusa. Spiritual warfare in Laiusa. And I want to take uh the subject of teaching your children about spiritual warfare. If they don't understand it and they're ignorant of it, uh it's so easy to take a spirit from the world, okay? And you start because whatever you yield your spirit to, you become the servant thereof. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not being critical. It's not preaching the law. But I want all of you to understand, you must have understanding of why we believe what we believe. &gt;&gt; It all comes back from the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right. &gt;&gt; And as we do some teaching on this, I want all of you to to put on your spiritual thinking caps and understand that we have now entered into the time of the greatest deception, a time of spiritual warfare that we've never seen. And it's coming to a head. &gt;&gt; You talk about people that have eaten from the tree of knowledge. And these are the leaders and these are the teachers and these are the professors and these are the people in the colleges that are teaching. And many of them lean so far left they're they're out of the picture. They're so filled with knowledge, as an example, that they don't know or cannot explain what is the difference between a man and a woman. Now, if you would have said 50 years ago that people would be saying, "Oh, there's more than two genders in the world," you'd think you're nuts. &gt;&gt; But it's happening. It's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh people are identifying with all kinds of things. &gt;&gt; But we identify with one thing because we came from God. We're going back to God. Therefore, when the word of God is presented to you, you identify with it, &gt;&gt; not the world, &gt;&gt; but yet the world is doing everything that it can. And I want you to understand, your children are at risk. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Parents, &gt;&gt; you got children. Praise God. You raise them up. You got these little ones and we dedicate them and and they go to our Sunday schools and they learn Jesus loves me. This I know. They learn some Bible verses. that doesn't keep them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They must have an experience with God themselves &gt;&gt; in order for God to keep them. Now, I'm going to take some things and I want you each individual be acutely aware that every family, every church is going to have to fight for every promise of the word of God. It's not given to you. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to learn to fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're gonna fight, fight a good fight. &gt;&gt; If you're gonna fight, fight to win. If you're gonna play the game, play to win. &gt;&gt; I've never played a game. I've never done any of those things to want to just say, "Well, you know, it really doesn't matter." I get into it. Um, just sharing with you, I played baseball in in in school, went four years uh in high school and I was a fairly good player and never hit a home run in my life. I'm not a power hitter, but I uh uh I was using the top three of the lineup and uh I got on base and my batting average was usually way over 300. Um, and I scored. Whenever I got on base, I scored. And uh so anyway, uh I uh I went through a lot of things as a young man and I learned that if you're going to play a game, get into the game, &gt;&gt; okay? Get into the game. &gt;&gt; Um and I was voted most inspirational, I think, every year when I played uh whatever team I was on. I just, you know, I'm not one of these guys. Okay. Well, we're behind uh 10 runs. Let's give up. No, I said, "Hey, the game ain't over till it's over." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hey, you know, let's not try to hit the ball over the fence. Just hit a man, just hit a a base hit. That's all we want. Get on base &gt;&gt; or take a walk, you know? Hey, a walk is as good as a run when he when he comes around. So, anyway, I I'm not here to coach the team tonight. That's that's different. That's different. But uh none of you are exempt. You all will be tested. &gt;&gt; You all will be tried. The contest is on. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said you will meet him. And you better know how he fights. You better know how to protect yourself because if you don't, now the prophet said he's got one good lick coming at you. &gt;&gt; And he said you better each one of you have an Achilles tendon. If you know what we're talking about. Each one of you have an area you must keep protected. &gt;&gt; It may be different for each one of you. One of you it might be music. Music to me is is Listen, I don't listen to music. When I get home, I don't turn music on. It's not something that motivates me. Okay, some of you might have music. Musicians have to be very careful, as an example, what type of music they listen to. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay? Because music has a tendency to set a certain atmosphere and next thing you know it's got a little tempo and next thing you know you're be you're being moved by the tempo. Uh even though the song may have nice lyrics, may talk about Jesus, but you have to be extremely careful. So each one of you have areas in your life that you've got to stay guarded. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're all different. Okay, some of you it might be money, might be a career, might be an education, something uh you know, that's what motivates you. That's what uh gets you going. And if you're not careful, Satan will take that and pull pull you out onto a limb. When he gets you out on the limb, he'll cut the limb off and you'll go down with it. All right? So now Israel, I want you to understand because now we look at brother Brand preaches a sermon called Israel and the church. &gt;&gt; He's showing you that what happened to Israel is going to happen to the bride. &gt;&gt; The 144,000 and the 10 virgins. Brother Bren makes this comparison showing that Israel once they were given the promised land and listen they come out of Egypt, praise the Lord, &gt;&gt; and they went through all of the trials and different things and are following Moses the pillar of fire and no matter how much of the supernatural they saw, they still had battles with the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There were still Nathan and chorus. There were others within the group that was always trying to say Moses takes too much authority to himself. And there was always somebody there that had dissenting voices. That will happen in every uh time that God sends a message. Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't don't don't get distract distracted by the dissenting voices even that are associated with this message. We have quite a few shimeies that like to throw dirt on whether it be the ministry or on other churches. We need to quit fighting one another and fight the devil. &gt;&gt; Okay? Fight the devil. &gt;&gt; Okay? Because he's our enemy. It's not your brother. It's not uh your brother because he maybe doesn't understand it like you. Well, that's okay. That will be between him and God. The main thing is we keep our hearts right and that our lives will be exemplary of the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. So, Israel had all kinds of wars. God said, "I'm going to give you the promised land." But guess what? They cross over Jordan. And what the first thing they do? They have to fight. Are you kidding me? I I Wait a second. Wait a second. You mean Canaan going into the promised land? Um, is that heaven? No, it's not heaven. In heaven, there's not going to be any wars. Thank God for that. There was a war in heaven. That's where it all started. &gt;&gt; Satan rose up and said, "I want to be like God. I want to raise my You all know the story." So, that battle, he was cast out of heaven, down to earth. And so, the earth became his domain temporarily. He's a squatter. Doesn't belong to him, &gt;&gt; but he's here. Nevertheless, and he has become the god of this evil age. That's right. &gt;&gt; And the only ones who understand, let's say, uh this position that he has in this age are message believers because we see um past the deception. Right. &gt;&gt; It's not the big You see, some people are in awe and everything because of big cathedrals and big stained glass windows. Even uh John when he said, "And I marveled at this scarlet colored uh woman who was decked with silver and gold and had on her name uh the blasphemies of God and and she was called Mystery Babylon." And I admired at her. And how many people admire just churches because it looks big and beautiful. God is not in beauty. He's in character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's not it's not We thank God for a nice church. Yeah. Praise the Lord. I came in a little bit early today, man. It said on my temperature of the car 113 degrees. I said I told Bobby and him, they were here early, him and brother Paul. I said, "Thank God for air conditioning." Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay? Because uh what did they do a hundred years ago when they gathered together? Let me tell you, they were tough believers. &gt;&gt; They came together. It didn't matter if it was outside in the shade of a tree or whatever. Hey, you were coming to hear the word of God. Sometimes I think we get too pampered. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we take it uh uh not as serious as we should. &gt;&gt; And so anyway, just as a pastor, I'm just telling you those things. They had to fight to possess the land. So will you &gt;&gt; think it not strange when these fiery trials to come upon you as though it be some strange thing? Listen, you're either going into a trial or coming out of one. &gt;&gt; But your whole life is going to be a trial. There are going to be times when wow, praise God, you you have an upward uh climb and and everything seems to be going good and then it plateaus off for a while. then it kind of uh slow things are not you know maybe a little bit of a dip and depends on uh your nar your nature your character but there's always hills and valleys and everything. We just pray that the graph of your life is going upward &gt;&gt; that if we were to look at the mountain tops and the peaks of the graph and we put a straight line it looks well he's going upward instead of he's flatlining or he's going downward. &gt;&gt; Okay, a tree is known by its fruit. So the fruit you are bearing right now and the things that you are doing in your life right now will be you give you a good indication of the life you're living when he returns. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So just look at your life right now and if you say I'm not doing too good chances are when he comes you'll be not doing too good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now it's not by works oriented. We know that. But do not do not make grace a disgrace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if you believe God and God gives you revelation, you will bring that into your life and it will manifest the faith that you say you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay? Though you are raised in a message family, it doesn't make you a message believer. &gt;&gt; Though you are raised in a message church, doesn't make you a message believer. Though you listen to tapes, that doesn't make you a message believer. You can press play and you can hear the word of God. But the Bible says to he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit is saying. So though the vocal cords of a messenger are being used and you can hear the enunciation of his voice, it isn't until you hear the voice behind the veil and you realize that God was using that prophet messenger to bring you back to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's what prophets do. They they always bring you back to the it is written. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the word of God is our absolute. &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, Ephesians 6. Let me go a little quickly now because I keep never finishing my sermon when I get up here. Ephesians 6:10-12. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil, meaning his trickery. He's going to try to trick you, fool you, deceive you, sift you like wheat if he can. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, &gt;&gt; but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. That's why you are going to fight in this end time. And it is a spiritual warfare. take off your little um mindset that you have that when I come into the message, my battle's over. No, it's just beginning. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, when I get the Holy Ghost, it's over. I'll be in a a place where I never make No, let me tell you, the devil, even with a Holy Ghost fililled believer, you still press the battle. &gt;&gt; You still fight to fight. &gt;&gt; You still got to do those things. You got to claim every promise, but you got to fight for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, so Satan has perfected this Eden. &gt;&gt; It is now filled with all kinds of principalities and powers. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll be talking later about all of the different things that will affect and especially our youth unless they understand spiritual war. I'm going to show you in the scripture. Turn with me to the book of Judges. Judges chapter 3. Judges 3:es 1-7. Now these are the nations which the Lord left. Who left them? God did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He left them. He didn't clear it all out. He said, "Go and possess the land and all of the nations that are before you. I'm going to wipe them out. They're dust." No, he left them there. Here's the reason. To prove Israel by them. He's going to prove Israel by the nations he left. Oh, you say you're a message believer. He's going to make you prove it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Even as many of Israel as had not known the wars of Canaan. Wow. Now, understand our youth have got to understand spiritual warfare. And here he's giving them an example. Many of the young people of Israel had not known the wars of Canaan. But God left some of these nations to try you. &gt;&gt; God did it &gt;&gt; only that the generation of the children of Israel might know to teach them war. &gt;&gt; You mean he left all of those tribes there to teach you war? Yes, he did. Understand it is a battle. &gt;&gt; And least such as before knew nothing thereof. You young people, wake up. Smell the coffee. &gt;&gt; This is not an easy thing. Jesus said, "You'll be hated of all men." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They will say all manner of evil against you falsely. &gt;&gt; But blessed are you &gt;&gt; for your eyes &gt;&gt; see, and your ears hear what others do not see. &gt;&gt; Thank God. You ought to you ought to rejoice. If you're having a hard time and people persecute you, thank God. He said, "Those that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." If you can't handle it, &gt;&gt; you ain't got it. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; You understand? Come on. This ain't babying you. &gt;&gt; You go to school and they make fun of the way you dress or you boys, you know, because you don't cuss and curse. &gt;&gt; Ah, you ought to thank God I'm not like them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. dare to be different. Now verse four, and they were to prove Israel by them to know whether they would hearken unto the commandment of the Lord. So God let him be there to see if you really are going to use the word in your life &gt;&gt; to keep the commandments. Verse five. And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hitittites, the Amorites, the Parizzites, the Hittites, the Jebusites, and all of the other websites. &gt;&gt; We're going to get into that because you know what? It's these websites and these things of the internet. God's got a net and Satan's got a net. &gt;&gt; God is the gospel net. He cast it out there. Right. But Satan's got a net. &gt;&gt; Be careful lest you be caught in the net of Satan. It's a snare of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Okay, watch this. And so he left the Canaanites, the Hittites, and all of them to prove them to see if you're going to keep the commandment of the Lord. Under no circumstance does a believer go out or date an unbeliever. no circumstance. Are we aware of that? &gt;&gt; Capiche comp &gt;&gt; or are you an exception? &gt;&gt; You think God loves you more than the rest of them? &gt;&gt; Now watch. He says, "I'm leaving them there to test you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you're going to be tested, young people. You're going to be tested. And the one you choose or the you look after shows a reflection of what's in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say you're a good message believer and you choose some Jezebel out of the world. Let me tell you, &gt;&gt; because the one you're choosing is a reflection of the spirit that's in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, so here's watch the result. He says, "I left them there to prove you." So, and they took their daughters to their wives. &gt;&gt; Wait a second. Didn't you have youth meetings? Didn't you tell them what's wrong with you, Moses? Joshua, why didn't you teach them? They did teach them. They just didn't listen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they took their daughters to be their wives and gave their daughters to their sons and served their gods. Not the God of Israel. Served their gods. &gt;&gt; Illegal union. &gt;&gt; You let somebody pair themselves with somebody from the world, you you're in trouble. And if you're not careful, there is the odd time you can marry somebody and uh you know what, they weren't a a message believer or something and you were and next thing you know they came in. But that's usually the exception of the rule, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Usually it is that they don't and then you you're unequally yolked and you're going to have a hard time. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; All right. So now uh and their children did evil in the sight of the Lord and forgot the Lord their God and serve Balum and their groves. Wow. God left those there to test you, to prove you, to see if you're going to do what you know to do. And the first thing you know, wives, marriage, this and that. My do you see? And what did they do? Illegal union. Wrong. got to serving other gods. How quickly it happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 11:es 1-4. I would to God you bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me. For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy. For I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chasteed virgin to Christ. But I fear less by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve. So now he's taking a type from the Old Testament. I am over you with a godly jealousy. I don't want nobody fooling with him. And he says, "Lest by any means as the serpent." So we'll look at that in a moment. As the serpent begal Eve through his subtlety, so your minds, so here's the battleground. The minds, amen, &gt;&gt; should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. &gt;&gt; Before the opening of the seals, what's the first sermon? Brother Brandon preaches God revealed in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you understand God in simplicity. Don't make this gospel hard. It's not. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even a wafering man can hear the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Amen. Okay. Now, watch this. Satan used the channel of reasoning to get Eve to stand there long enough. Now, Brother Brandham said it was years and years of her meeting her alone in the garden. Oh, hi Eve. Boy, you're sure looking good today. Oh, your cheeks are so rosy. I'm just kind of ad libbing here a little bit. You know what? It was years &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; of meeting her and then finally finally okay when he got her to stand still long enough and he used the channel of reasoning. So now watch here's what is going to come against you is Satan will use to most of you he will use one of the channels of the five senses to your spirit because if he can affect your spirit he's got you. Okay. So, greatest battle ever fought 62. The battle raged when Eve opened up her mind to listen to her reasoning. That's the flu it come in. That's the channel it run down her reasoning. She in her soul, she reasoned. Her eyes was sight. And he goes on talked about seeing uh this subtle beast of the field and he was a fairer man than her husband and so on and so forth. Paragraph 117. First thing she did, she opened her mind and when she did, human reasoning caught it. &gt;&gt; Now, greatest battle ever fought. That's what all of you are going to be dealing with certain things in your mind because the greatest battle fought is in your mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I fear less by any means the devil will take advantage of you and we are not ignorant of the devil's devices. &gt;&gt; Okay. So that's the reason we teach you these things. Well, brother Ron, why don't you talk about the love of God and Christ at Calvary and and you know all of these things. Listen, you should be beyond that right now. &gt;&gt; Yes, we know Christ him crucified. But we've got to understand in spiritual warfare once we become a Christian and we start walking we're gonna have to fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you otherwise you you might become another one who is a shipwreck like Himenius and Alexander. &gt;&gt; He said turn them over to the devil for the destruction of their flesh. &gt;&gt; They learn not to blasphe. So many people within this message are saying such blasphemous things, &gt;&gt; you know, and then trying to trying to say the prophet of God made a mistake here and there. Listen, he was a human. He made mistakes. I'll give you the quote. Brother Bram said, I prove to you today that all the prophets, all the men of God made their mistakes, but God makes no mistakes. Listen, I thank God that our Bible shows us whether it's Abraham, whether it's Elijah, or any one of them, they made their mistakes. &gt;&gt; And yet God makes no mistakes. He comes in there and corrects the prophet. He corrects his children. He corrects Abraham. Why? Because love is corrective. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. If God is chasening you, it's it's proof that he loves you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, others get away with it. And look at them. Yeah. Well, they ain't his either. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A bastard child, &gt;&gt; will not receive correction. &gt;&gt; He doesn't waste his time. But on you try to get away with it. Whackle. Five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. No pain, no gain. &gt;&gt; Okay. So I'll be teaching on the five inlets to the spirit man. They are memory, imagination, conscience, affection and reasoning. Years ago, brother Biscoll says uh I have done relational association and I say my car m I c a r memory, imagination, conscience, affection. Everybody wants my car. You understand? So think about these memory, &gt;&gt; imagination, conscience, affection. Let your affections not be on the things of this world. Some of you are going to have horrible times in your flesh. Why? Because your affections are the thing on the things of this world. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Hey, listen. Take no thought for tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. Okay. So, and reasoning. And so, understand the devil's going to use reasoning. And so, we'll look into that. I'm going to show you now as the serpent begal Eve. So, how did he do it? Genesis 3:13. And the Lord God said unto the woman, "What is thou that thou hast done?" And the woman said, "The serpent beguiled me." Now, that's a word we don't use a whole lot. Beguiled. In Hebrew, the word beguiled. Nasha. It means to lead astray. It means to delude or to morally seduce. The serpent seduced me. How did he do it? He used words first, then he physically took her. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Understand that? words first, then the physical act took later. &gt;&gt; That's how you got seducing spirits. Get into the church. What are they? Fornicating, adulterous, &gt;&gt; enticing, seducing, &gt;&gt; lascivious. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All having the enticement of something of the flesh. You see, religious spirits are unclean spirits. Religious &gt;&gt; people &gt;&gt; have unclean spirits. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So the serpent beguiled me and I did eat. It means to deceive and with treacherous cunning and skillful deceit by using words. God uses words to as many as would believe my words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because my words are spirit and they are alive. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, Satan's got words. &gt;&gt; God uses word. Satan uses words. God said, "Of the tree of knowledge, thou shalt not eat because the day you eat thereof, you shall die." Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, God said that. Now, he's not a threatening repeating parent. He says it one time, you believe it, you obey it. &gt;&gt; Okay. And so, uh, Satan comes in and he changes just words. Surely you'll not die. God said, "Surely you'll die." He said, "Surely you'll not." So all Satan's got to do is start with just a little bit of your reasoning. Oh, you won't die if you, you know, so he changes. He seduces. He beguiles your mind through reasoning. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, let me say say something. years ago when we were at the church on Maryland, many of you younger ones were probably either just born or whatever and you may not remember this. Barry Coffee sent me a he he actually called me on the phone. He said, "Brother Ron, are you aware of a website? I forget the name of it, Zonga or Wonga or whatever." and he said, "Uh, I think you should look on there because it's a lot of the names that are on this website of those that are friends or whatever are young people in your in your church." Wow. Well, I don't surf the internet. I don't go. He said, "Okay, he called me up. Are you on your computer?" "Yes, sir. Type in this. Go to the website www like this. Go." I opened it up. My my my message youth in my own church were sharing things on that website with one another. Here's the songs that I like best. Worldly rock and roll songs. Here are my idols. Here are my this and that. The boys sharing what their their favorite sport god was. And he was the god of uh football. The god because look and I'm going to show you the gods of this world. Brother Ram said, "Fashion can be a go." The god of fashion. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, as much as we preach holiness, we still have young girls that come to church wearing skin down wiener stuff. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's terrible. It's terrible. And I ask you, daddies, teach your daughters. &gt;&gt; That's right. If you let them go to school like that, I got no control of that. You let them come to church, &gt;&gt; preacher, &gt;&gt; then I say, "Hey, if you got guts enough to come to church and you look like you were poured into that dress, &gt;&gt; then I'm gonna preach against it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna make you Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not going to be easy. Is that okay with you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? Somebody say yes, brother. Go ahead, man. You got it. Hey, look. I can't control my kids. You might as well try to. How would you like to be a teacher today? Huh? Because the parents don't control them. &gt;&gt; Please can't control them. &gt;&gt; They buck every authority. So give them to the church. Give them to the Sunday school teachers. Give them to the youth leaders. You take care of them. I can't do nothing with them. Tell you what, a young person assasses back their mom and dad. It is as a spirit of rebellion, &gt;&gt; sin of witchcraft &gt;&gt; comes in. Yeah. You &gt;&gt; h excuse me. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Do you know the only reason brother Billy Paul had problems in his life? He drank and smoked. You all know that. You've heard his life story. He he drank and smoked. Brother Brenham put up with Billy Paul going through some of these hard times. Hey, listen. This is the prophet of the hour. This is a pastor of a church and his own kids are having problems. Don't think that you're exempt from it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Your children being raised up in church and Billy under the headship of his daddy and his daddy. I I've told you the stories about drinking and and his smoking and I don't need to I'm not going to waste the time on that. And even the time when when Billy Paul came home and told his daddy, I want to get married. Just a young boy. Daddy, I want to get married. Brother man's out washing his car. What'd he say? Oh, just go butt your head against the wall, Billy. Billy didn't take it. His dad serious. So, you know what he did? He went out and got married. &gt;&gt; Oh, great. Never. The girl had no permission. Neither did Billy Paul. And so now, now they're married. Okay. So, brother Brennham and the father of the girl went to the marriage and and they anulled it. Then they asked brother Brennham, "Isn't an anulment the same as divorce?" He said, "Oh my oh my, I have to go over these things." Listen, do you understand that even the prophet's own family had to he had to preach to his own family? &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody said the other day, "Well, if Mita Brandom was in a message church today, some of them would not let her go there." Wait a second. Wait a second. Wake up. You realize that his own family, he had to, as an example, if any of you knew Rebecca Smith, Brother Brennham's daughter, okay? He had to tell his own family, in fact, he called Billy and said, "Get the girls together. I've got thus sayaith the Lord." Wow. &gt;&gt; God, thus sayith the Lord for the girls. Got them together. He said, "How many times have I told you to not wear high heel shoes?" &gt;&gt; And he says, "And you get rid of them, and a couple months later, you buy them again and put them in your closet. I'm going to tell you from now on, the blood's on you. I'll not tell you again." &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham had to with his own family. Okay? And let me tell you that the Brandom family is not our absolute. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The word of God is. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; I don't care if Joseph Brandham has got a big screen TV and watches it every Sunday. Somebody asked me the other day, "Well, Brother Ron, um, people, this came to me just two days ago. Somebody texted me, "Brother Ron, people are bringing televisions back into their home because they do the same thing on their cell phone. So why not, you know, what's the difference?" Oh, let me tell you. It is not the radio. It is not the television. It is not the movies. It is not what it is. There's a spirit behind it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham said the radio could have been mightily used of God to preach the gospel, but he said Satan come in there and perverted it. &gt;&gt; He said uh television could have been used of God, but he said Satan perverted. It is the misuse. &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the cell phone and of movies and of television and stuff. And that's why he said apply the token. &gt;&gt; Kick that trash out. It's not just a television. It's about all of these other things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Barry Coffee, he he said, "Uh, Ron, um, you better look on this. These are kids from your own church." Oh, no, not really. No. Whoa. Was this ever a wakeup call for me as a pastor? And I said, um, so I went on to everyone and I did the little check. Make me your friend. Make me your friend so I can see the rest besides of what you got on the front page. Let me read the other pages. And while I checked them and sent it away. And while I'm at the computer, all of a sudden, block block. &gt;&gt; These are these are kids in my own church. Do you think I was a happy camper? Now, so the wakeup call is, hey, I do not take any of this for granted. Your kids are much smarter than you are. Parents, wake up and understand, okay? That your kids are on websites, they're on apps, that are doing things and texting and with one another and inappropriate and watching and thinking and acting and and texting and sexing and all of this. Hey, hey, hey, wake up. &gt;&gt; Wake up. It's here. It's reality. This is the enemy. And we are not ignorant of the devil's devices, lest he take advantage of you. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I don't have a problem." Well, your kids do. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; And you need to be diligent about watching over your kids. Well, what they do in their room, it's their business. Are you kidding me? It's my home. &gt;&gt; Anyway, &gt;&gt; that was a big wakeup call. I thank brother Barry Coffee because he was a little more uh knowledgeable about websites and different things and apps and boy that was a wakeup call for me. I want all all of you to have uh parental awareness should be parental involvement. &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. Parental awareness should be parental involvement. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Find out. Does your kids have you locked out of their cell phone, their computer? Huh? Do you have their password so you can go there and see what they're they're doing? Huh? What about their video games? Do they let you watch what video games they're on? Is is it conducive to creating a good atmosphere or the character of Christ in their life? Is it repeating scripture? Is that memory verses? &gt;&gt; I doubt it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anyway, um we are in the midst of perverted laudia. &gt;&gt; It's darkness. &gt;&gt; It is a terrible time. Do you allow your children to play on the interstate out here? Do you allow them when you're doing a remodel on your house and you're fixing the electricity, you know, the electrical panel on the outside that's got all those switches, you let your kids go up there and just touch their fingers on open wiring? Do you let your kids uh go into the cabinet and drink any kind of deadly poison or do you watch over them? Because little kids, they're they're crazy. You know, my parents, my mom, and she was as strict and watching over, but she had twins. And my mother said, "I would not wish twins on my worst enemy." She said, "By the time you get one quiet and ready to go to sleep, the other one starts crying and they kicks the other one and this and that." My mother said that we got into stuff so much that she had to keep us both in the same room lest we, you know, the other one go off in the other room. My mother one time, I think it was I started crying in the back room. Um, I took the lid off Clorox and I'm drinking Clorox and I'm going and she sees a Clorox bottle. Okay. And my mother, oh my god, my son Clorox. Then my brother in the front room, he got into Drano. He was taking Drano crystals. Cleans like a white tornado. We painted when my dad left a can of black paint. He was painting something out in the garage and he left a can of black paint with a brush. Well, we got up there and hey, we turned ourselves black. Painted from head to toe. Kids will get into things. They'll do things. Why? Because they're immature. They don't know better. Your children are going to test you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yep. &gt;&gt; Amen. And yes, when they're little. Oh, it's so cute to watch you guys all come in with your little kids and they're so nice. Wait till they get to be teenagers. &gt;&gt; We'll see if you did a good job or not because they're going to test you. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Okay. Wow. This is good. You don't allow your toddlers to play outside around a swimming pool &gt;&gt; with no super adult supervision. &gt;&gt; We had a child drown in our in our church. Remember the Ogden child? I get called to the hospital. He drowned. Been four or minutes at the bottom of the pool. The children came in to tell the mother, "Hey, hey, she's watching a movie. Don't disturb me." I said, "Stay outside and play." So the kids wanted to tell mom our brother's at the get called to the hospital and you talk and they hand me the baby, little baby that I dedicated. I hold him in my arms and the mother says, "Brother Ron, I believe you're a man of God. whatsoever you say, if you will speak life, my child shall live. And I got doctors and nurses and I'm in the emergency room and my heart is broken. I've got a lifeless young boy in my arms. You don't think that I didn't want to say, "Little son, I give you your life back in the name of Jesus." But the son can do nothing. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. except the father. And I did. I said, "God, if you'll speak the word, I don't care if there's doctors here. I don't care. Hey." And I I told the parents, "I am sorry. I am sorry. I I don't have a word. I was there when they took the little footprint as a memory. They take the little ink pad. They take the foot and they put it there and they put it on a piece of paper in memory of they like take a locket of his hair. They take his handprint. You don't think that didn't tear me up? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to have a a a paper in memory of &gt;&gt; No, let that's why what I'm saying you've got to supervise. Watch your children. &gt;&gt; What are they playing with? Who are they hanging around with at school? Where do they get these attitudes? They go to school. &gt;&gt; They come home. Well, who they hanging around with? Chances are some kid, some rebel at school. They're hanging around with &gt;&gt; they pick up that attitude and then they start sassing mom or dad. I tell you what, God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Anyway, now Brother Brennham says, "Israel and the church, help me to go on, Lord. We've had earthquakes. We've had wars and rumors of wars. We've had tidal waves." And Jesus uh said would be the sea a roaring men's hearts failing more heart trouble number one disease fear perplexive time distress between the nations horseless carriages in the broadways speaking of old testament prophecy all these things fulfilled but the last plague is death &gt;&gt; physically speaking not physically speaking but spiritually speaking death spiritually in the church you notice Notice it was amongst the son's spiritual death. &gt;&gt; Spiritual death. So the last plague is spiritual death. &gt;&gt; Discerning the body of the Lord. Not discerning the Lord's body. Many are weak and sickly. Many are asleep. Dead. Spiritually dead. &gt;&gt; The last plague that hit Egypt was death. The last plague that's hit the church is spiritual death. What we need today is spiritual awakening. A spiritual awakening to discernment. &gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about. Hey, wake up. &gt;&gt; Parents, wake up. Spiritual discernment. &gt;&gt; Start looking. Reading. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; What are your kids listening to? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What are they reading? Third Exodus. They killed the children with what? &gt;&gt; He killed the children the first two times with natural death. The last time he's getting the children and killed them with spiritual death, marrying and intermaring. &gt;&gt; Wow. Just exactly what they did in the book of Judges. I left you the Jebusites and all of these to see if you're going to believe the message enough that you don't marry unbelievers. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, you're getting pretty old-fashioned, man. Hey, hey, this is the 21st century. this is, you know, and and uh pretty soon you're out here and you're letting Johnny hang around this Jezebel of a girl or the girl who's raised in church, hanging around a rebel boy because he pays attention to her. &gt;&gt; Serious. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. It's very serious. God help us to get real serious. Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the areas of problematic areas, magazines, media, movies, music, cars, immorality centered around women. Immorality centered around women. &gt;&gt; It used to be, as a pastor I watched, it used to be, this is from firsthand experience, it used to be the young boys that were kind of dabbling and going into the world. Now it's the girls. &gt;&gt; The girls are having more problems than the guys. Boy, I'm not getting no amen on that. &gt;&gt; But it's true. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the girls are trying to keep up with some Jezebel in school. &gt;&gt; Because you don't want to, you know, you just want to be accepted. You're never going to be accepted as a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not as a true Christian. Now, if you want to be one of these uh do anything, believe anything, and feel good churches, they'll let you do and okay, but not this message. Why? Because it is a separator. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay, we have to understand that it's a separator. And either you will purge your own life or God will purge you. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? &gt;&gt; Okay. If do you know that the a sign of the end time is the beauty of women? &gt;&gt; Watch this. I read this to uh brother Steven McNeely. Uh marriage and divorce. Did you know the first destruction internationally of the world or worldwide was because of pretty women. Internationally, the world was destroyed because of pretty women. When the sons of God saw the daughters of man were fair, they taken of them women. Is that right? Have you noticed the increase of beauty of women in this day? There isn't a teenage girl. He talked about Pearl O'Brien who was the the beauty of of this day. Stephen McNeely typed in, you could Google Pearl O'Brien. Okay. could grieve and she was the beauty queen of that day. Listen to what brother Brim said. There isn't a teenage girl in this school who would outshadow her when it comes to beauty. The increase of the beauty of women is showing the time of deception. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Beauty is deceiving. &gt;&gt; It's vain. And the best years you have are all of our lives is up to about 20 to 25 and after that you start dying. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. No matter how the Arnold Schwarzenegger got muscles or you know the woman, she's built like a Barbie doll, which they say is unreal. And yet that's what the girls played with was Barbie dolls and dress them and everything. It's just Satan uses all of that &gt;&gt; to deceive. It's a time of deception. The beauty of women. That's why, listen, I want our girls to look nice, not too nice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I do. You might want to put a little tiara in them and give them a little wand and give them the high heel shoes and let them walk around the house and they think they're so cute and get them a little makeup kit and you think that's okay. That entices their spirit. &gt;&gt; And when you start making over them that they are the beauty queen of the they're going to start believing you and pretty soon they're going to start acting out what you're telling them. say God is not found in beauty. He's found in character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And beauty, he said, will be a curse to young girls in this day. And some of you are really cursed. Others, yeah. So, I don't mean to make a joke about that, but it is true. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the young girl who is very very pretty is going to have a hard time. Now the girl who's not so pretty has to try to pick up boys by becoming loose. &gt;&gt; Her attraction will be that she will give of herself. &gt;&gt; Uh &gt;&gt; yeah it gets real quiet but this is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. God help us teach our kids. Now watch this. Uh the prophet took the sword of the spirit and he began to dissect and discern what is troubling you in your spirit realm. He called it seducing spirits, enticing spirits that come down that want to seduce you like he did Eve in the beginning. And he's going to do it through the inner course of your mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I am over you with a godly jealousy, Paul said, lest any mean by any means Satan will take advantage of you. Now, wow. Uh, Philadelphiaian church age, church age book. I'm not going to read all of it. You go home and read it. I give you these quotes. You go ahead. It's even on our website so you can look at them or read them in in the fullness. But to save time, okay, in Philadelphiaian church age. Now, we can take a note immediately that this problem of the false Jew or false believers was already in existence with the second age. These who falsely called themselves Jews appeared right after the first outpouring of the first age. And now they appear again in the second age after the reformation. This is hardly an accident. Indeed, it's not an accident. It is a principle of Satan. In other words, this is what he's going to do. Here's how he plays by the rules. He don't change. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's his principle. &gt;&gt; That principle is to organize and claim originality and therefore be entitled to special rights and privileges. Let me show you. Back there in the Sriraanian age, these people lied and said they were actually Jews or believers when they definitely were not. They were of the synagogue of Satan. They were Satan's organized crowd. For it was in that age we saw the start of men in the ministry taking unwarranted leadership over the ministering brethren. Bishops set up districts over elders. The next thing we saw that in the third age there was definitely a place called Satan's seat. We're talking among the church. &gt;&gt; It's happening even in the first church age. Paul said, "Oh my, you've left your first love." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These are people that were under the ministry of Jesus Christ, under the ministry of the disciples, &gt;&gt; and yet within 40 or 50 years, you've already left your first love. I'm of Paul and I'm of Apollos and separating and dividing fellowship. My So, let's go on. I'm showing you the history of the church. &gt;&gt; It repeats, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's cyclic or cyclic, however you say it. It's in a cycle, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It happened. As it was, so shall it be. As it was, so shall it be. Happening again. They were Satan's organized crowd. For it was in that age we saw that the start of men in the ministry taking an unwarranted leadership over the ministering brethren. Oh, I read that. I'm okay. Let's go down to the bottom part there. He says, "Now, of course, this synagogue group won't say they are of Satan. No, sir. They say they're of God, but they lie. For he that is a true Jew, that is what they claim to be, is one who is a Jew inwardly in the spirit. So then if they are all false Jews, it meant that they were, as Jude 19 says, having not the spirit. Children of God are born of the spirit. These have not the spirit and therefore they are not children of God. No matter how ferently they protest and to what lengths they go to try to prove that they are they are dead. Brother Brennham capitalized that. I didn't. They are dead. They are children of organization and their true fruits are missing. They are built upon their own creeds, dogmas, doctrines and the truth is not in them. For they have taken their own counselss above the word of God. That's why what I do is I try to show you bring you back to the word of God. That's what prophets do. &gt;&gt; They bring you back to the faith or the revelation of your fathers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not just preaching law. &gt;&gt; It's showing you what happened. How did it happen? How do people get away from the word of God? Why is it that so many ministers hit the ditch? Why is it so many people go away? Why is it so many people have a hard time serving God? Brother Ran preaches a sermon. Why are people so tossed about? Because they don't take the word of God as their absolute. They're not praying and reading like they should. And every one of you, whether you're old or young, realize God is not deceived. Be not mocked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not mocked. &gt;&gt; That whatsoever you yield yourself to, you become the servant thereof. &gt;&gt; Amen. either to righteousness or unrighteous. Yield to the the God of sports, the God of fashion, the God of music. You yield yourself to it and you will become the servant thereof. &gt;&gt; Next thing you know, you'll quit going to church. The word of God is no longer uh your absolute. And pretty soon, you know, every little bit is just a little further and a little further and a little further until until How did they get way out here? &gt;&gt; Yep. And the next thing you know, I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; Don't believe it. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do? What if your parents do it? What if your parents say, "H, ain't nothing to it." You going to go also? &gt;&gt; You got any revelation? Is this message revealed to you that it's Christ in him? &gt;&gt; Amen. That this is Christ, the mystery of God revealed, and you're a part of it. &gt;&gt; But guess what? The enemy is not going to let you just sit back and have a picnic. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; You're going to fight. &gt;&gt; You're going to fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Anything worth fighting for is worth having. If &gt;&gt; you don't fight for it, it ain't worth having. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the heads of the house allow things to be done that compromises on the word, everyone below that headship starts to compromise and it gets worse. &gt;&gt; So the heads of the house are going to be the ones that are responsible for those below them. &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen. Okay. Oh, well, I love my kids so much I just let them do what they want. Real true love is corrective. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Okay. We know that uh if the father of the household or the pastor or the prophet compromises on the word of God, everything below that compromises, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And it gets worse because the progression of sin Okay, let me show you in Joshua 7 because here is the story of Achen. Joshua chapter 7 18- 26. And he brought his household man by man. Joshua did. And Achen the son of Carmi the son of Zebedee the son of Zerah. And then of the tribe had viewed it was taken. And Joshua said unto Achen, "My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession unto him, and tell me now what thou hast done. Hide it not from me." And Achen answered, and said, Joshua, I indeed have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done. And when I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonian garment and 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels weigh. Then I coveted them and took them and behold they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and silver under it. So now what he thought he could do in private now affects the whole church. &gt;&gt; Amen. What am I? My brother's keeper. Come on, man. Does it really matter the life you live at home? &gt;&gt; Did with Achen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch this. So they took Achen, verse 24. and Joshua and all the Israel with him took Achen the son of Zarah silver the garment the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen his asses his whole household even affected his animals and the tent all that he had brought him to the valley of Acor and Joshua said why hast thou troubled us and the Lord shall trouble thee this day and all Israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire. And after they stoned them with with the stones, and they raised over him a great heap of stones. And to this day, so the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place is called the Valley of Acor unto this day. How many achens do we have within the message that say it really doesn't matter what I have in my tent, what I do in my home? That's my business. I beg to differ with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; We as a church are only as strong as our weakest link. &gt;&gt; Your home is your castle and your fortress. &gt;&gt; It is a place of refuge that when you come home, you want to be able to take your shoes off. You've been fighting spirits all day, man. &gt;&gt; You want to be able to come home. This is my castle. This is my fortress. and in this place of my refuge and I want to be able to to rest. But if you compromise, what you've done is you've opened the door of sin &gt;&gt; to your family, to your kids, and they will suffer. &gt;&gt; Okay? You start losing battles and wondering how did this happen? I want you to take inventory. When Ahab married Jezel caused of all of Israel to go into sin and idolatry. When Constantine married papal Rome to pagome it revived the whole harlot system. And when Gerobam compromised with the word, he caused all of Israel to compromise. And the sins of Jeroboam and those that followed Jeroboam did worse. And the I've showed you before in the scripture. And they did worse in the eyes of God than their father Jerob. And they did worse because the progression of sin is worse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what we preach at church, it's what you practice at home that counts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brennham said, let me just give you an example. He said, "Now years ago, the ill-fade women was called a chorus girl." Then he said, "A flapper." Then he said, "A strip tease." Are you watching the progression of sin? &gt;&gt; Roll them, girlies, roll them. Show them your pretty knees. Showing of the knees during the Second World War was a sign of prostitution. The prostitutes sat along the road and they showed their knees. What kind of a spirit would make a woman show her needs today? &gt;&gt; This is tough, isn't it? &gt;&gt; That's why brother Ram said, "Hey, listen. Teach you mothers, teach your daughters, &gt;&gt; teach them, fathers, teach your kids at home." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay? So no matter what we're preaching, if you're not under that same standard, you lower the standard and everybody below that compromises. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So pretty soon, Junior's down on the street with his hot rod. Syis is hanging around at the cantina or the roadhouse. Look at the progression. And brother Bram said, if it goes on today, what will it be like? Why? He said it's such a modern &gt;&gt; thing of immorality. It's all around. Why are people having problems sexually? Why is this an issue in the end time? Because it's a fornicating and adulterous spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's what that's what you'll fight. &gt;&gt; Fight some unclean spirit. trouble you, bother you. Okay, musicians have become how do evil spirits enter the home? How do they enter the church? How do they enter your children? Do you remember the young girl that brother Brennham used the example? She was raised up. She knew better. a young girl and she stopped to listen to the music. Brother Renham tells a story. He said she stopped to listen to the music. Next thing you know, she found herself out on the dance floor in the arms of a man. And he said, next thing you know, her marriage was a mess. Where did she wind up? insane institution, &gt;&gt; right? [Music] &gt;&gt; Because she just wanted to be normal. Brother Renom had to go visit her in the insane institution. He said, "I sat with her and I started to talk to her. I wanted to catch her spirit because she's You ever been in one of those institutions. You ever seen what it's like? There's three or four doors that you have to go through because they don't want the people escaping. It's not nice. When a spirit comes into the church, comes into a youth, comes into a family, what happens? How how do you know it's there? Because it brings fruits. There are fruits of a clean spirit and there are fruits of an unclean spirit. Now, the Bible says that we've got to take every thought under the obedience of the mind of Christ. Is that right? &gt;&gt; We've got to take it captive. So, we fight battles. We fight it every day. I'm doing a little bit of a teaching series on this because I'm going slow and I don't want to apologize because some of you have invited friends or neighbors to the church and they want to hear me preach the gospel. Well, this is part of the gospel only teaching it. Is that okay with you? &gt;&gt; It's teaching it. So, I don't apologize with what I teach because I'm speaking to the family of God. &gt;&gt; If they're true seed of God, it's not going to offend them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because brother Brennham said there was Peter inviting all his friends and neighbors and said, "Come hear Jesus of Nazareth. Maybe he's going to turn water to wine. Maybe he's going to fishes and loaves and he's going to do something and he'll discern the hearts. Behold, an Israelite in whom there is no G and everything and and and wow, he's going to do some kind of miracle. And he gets up there on that great feast day and he said, "Except you eat of my flesh and drink of my blood, you have no part with me." He said, Peter hangs his head. Oh my, why did he have to say that? Why did he say that? You know, I've been working with these people for months. Finally, they come and he says that and they look at Peter like, "Yeah, is that who you follow? I'm out of here. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. That's your Bible." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it says, "And many of them were offended." Said, "This is a hard thing. It's going to get harder, saints. &gt;&gt; The trials are going to get tougher. &gt;&gt; Your children are going to grow. You're going to go through things at work, in your career, in your job, in your school, and you're going to be tested. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You're going to be tested. You need to know spiritual warfare. Teach the children war. &gt;&gt; They need to know how do I get a spirit? How do I get a stronghold in my life? How how does it come? Brother Renham in sermon demonology he said if you open the door to a spirit and you knowing better go and open that door he says you've allowed a spirit to come in and he says now you can have the preacher and anoint you with oil and try to cast that devil out and he sits there and he he just laughs. He said, "Until." Because some demons, some demons do not come out, but by prayer and fasting. Not by the preacher, but by the person who's got it. And they say, "God, why am I always going back and over the same thing, and I repent, and I go back?" Because Jesus said, "Now go and sin no more, lest the worst thing come upon you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. This is the scripture. &gt;&gt; Teach your children warfare. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I'm trying to do. This is kind of boot camp. &gt;&gt; It is. It &gt;&gt; I'm teaching. I'm real serious. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we lower the standard, the whole family will suffer. No matter how much we hold up the standard on dating unbelievers, if the parents open that door, you know, I I was preaching this up in Canada one time and I had parents that withtood me on it and said, "Well, you know, listen, I think you're too hard. We're we're we're not going to we're telling our kids different." So, they invited me to the house. They said, "We're not going to do, you know, we think this is too strict." I said, "Okay, okay." We come over, three of the girls were there, the parents, and I said, "Um, are you burning for a man?" I looked at the I asked each girl, "Are you burning for a man?" "Well, no." Oh, I said, 'Well, mama, you're saying that we shouldn't hold these standards. So, you know, uh, I want my daughters to marry young. Next thing you know, they're going to marry some guy out here, first one that comes along, and you haven't taught them correctly. So, this gets down to some real serious business. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody told me the other day that one even one of my grandchildren told somebody, "Well, I'm going to marry somebody." I think they were four or five years old. I'm going to marry so and so when I get older, four or five years old. Are you kidding me? Are you You know, this is kids. This is a little house play. Well, you shouldn't even be thinking about marriage at four or five, right? I mean, I got trouble and got sent to the principal's office in junior high school [Music] and in grade school cuz I kept throwing rocks at the girls. I just I Hey, they wanted to chase me and give me a kiss on the cheek during recess. I hated that. Get away. We had to do square dancing in sixth grade. Are you kidding me? Dosey-do your partner and swing your partner and all this kind. I hated it. And the girls are smiling, looking at you. Hated dancing and you know I got I did I I went to the principal's office. Wasn't until I got a little bit older and it, you know, I realized, wow, you shouldn't throw rocks at them. As I got older and I realized you, I grew up and put away childish things. I love you guys and I want to preach a truth. I do. I want you to preach that to your children. &gt;&gt; I want you to go back and listen to these tapes. Go back and read your Bibles. &gt;&gt; See, he says it's better that a man marry than to burn. Right? &gt;&gt; So for the cause that it keep fornication, it's better that a man marry a woman lest he create a a problem. Okay? So but you'll find out. You think that that stops lustful thoughts after you get married. Brothers, sisters, wake up. Just because you bought the candy store doesn't mean you don't still have a sweet tooth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to keep yourself covered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Husbands love your wives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As Christ loved the church, gave himself for it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes. He says, "I show you a greater mystery. I show you Christ in the church." &gt;&gt; Because if we're not careful, what happens? Satan comes in &gt;&gt; and he comes in and he if he came against the first couple of God in God's &gt;&gt; Eden Amen &gt;&gt; where there was no sin &gt;&gt; there was no sin rampant all around it was just Satan walking him in the garden and he attacked Eve and then Paul picks it up I fear less by And he means the way that he beguiled you &gt;&gt; is the way he's going to beguile you. &gt;&gt; God, help us to put our spiritual thinking cap on. Look around. Look at our families. Look at our children. Look at what we're letting them watch and see. And I trust that your kids, you have their password and even on their cell phone or their computer. So you can go in and say, "Hey, daddy would like to just see." Open your Facebook or Instagram or whatever these apps are that these kids have. Let me see who let me see how many friends you got. &gt;&gt; Let me see who you allow to be your friend. &gt;&gt; Because friendship with the world is what? &gt;&gt; Emnity with God. &gt;&gt; Be careful who you call friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Spiritual warfare in Laa. We're in it. It's hot and heavy. And he said seducers will wax worse and worse. False prophets will come. They will do all of these things. And he said, "Wake up. We're here. This is end times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, one of the signs of this end time that we're in the midst of it is the beauty of women. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; And he said, just as what happened then, it's happening again today. God, help us to teach our little girls to have character and not so much on beauty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father, as we have spoke these words tonight to your people, and they're my people. I'm not trying to do this on the internet. I'm not trying to get others to listen to me. No. The only reason I even allow these services to be archived is for the sake of my church. I'm not interested in trying to correct other churches and what they do in other pastors. They're sovereign within themselves. I'm not trying to do that, Father. But I'm trying to be a go a good godly shepherd over the sheep that you have given here under our leadership. doing all that I can to try to keep the enemy, false shepherds and ravenous wolves and different things that come in to try to destroy the sheep. Father, I thank you. I praise you. I pray take what broken up sermon that I've preached tonight and bless it to the hearts of your people. Let them understand, Father, that we have the flashing red lights of the signs of your coming. You're coming soon. May we all be ready and have our lives in order and our life in order that we could walk in a way that's pleasing to you because by without faith it's impossible to please you. Father, I thank you. I praise you. Take this sermon now and use it for your glory in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, turn your eyes upon Jes. Look for in his wonderful o and the things of the earth will grow straight in the light of his glory. Yes. Turn your eyes. Turn your eyes on. [Music] looked for in his wonderful face and the things of the earth will grow straight in the light of his glory and grace. Brother Chris Clayville, come up here, my brother.
