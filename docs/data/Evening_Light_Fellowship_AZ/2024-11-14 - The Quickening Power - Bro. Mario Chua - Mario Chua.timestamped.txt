[26:47] brother so and so brother you know shake
[26:48] their hand everything so but uh he I
[26:51] said there's there's how many know that
[26:54] we are encompassed by such a cloud of
[26:56] witnesses you're not alone hey they're
[26:59] just another
[27:00] dimension and and so it was in that

[27:12] for brother Mike Patterson I would have
[27:15] liked to have been here but uh it just

[27:36] memorial service and and I want to say
[27:39] how proud I am of all of you for doing

[27:46] sister Sandy and I flew to Houston as
[27:48] you all know we flew to
[27:50] Houston uh we rented a car and uh it
[27:54] started raining in Houston and rained
[27:57] all the way up to bont that's an hour
[27:59] and a half Drive hour and 40 minute
[28:01] drive and we got there and and uh you
[28:04] want to know why they have such green
[28:06] grass and so many trees huh you got to
[28:09] have rain you got to have
[28:12] moisture and
[28:15] so you want to know why everything's so
[28:18] Brown
[28:20] here and why we have cacti instead of
[28:24] trees it's because it doesn't rain that
[28:26] much we're in a different uh
[28:28] ecosystem in the area but praise the
[28:30] Lord anyway uh we spent the night there
[28:33] in Bulma the next morning we drove about
[28:36] 30 minutes north to a little city that
[28:38] we help Pastor a little group of people
[28:40] there in Silsby
[28:43] Texas and uh understand it's been 42
[28:46] years 42 years since we had done that so
[28:49] we drove around trying to find our old
[28:51] house and what you do when when if you
[28:54] haven't been somewhere in 42 years it
[28:56] changes
[28:58] okay and you go back and wow where where
[29:00] was the old lumber yard cuz we we live
[29:03] next to the lumber yard and and so
[29:05] anyway we finally asked somebody said
[29:08] well now it's over uh it used to be and
[29:11] now it's just kind of a storage area
[29:14] that's it and I said well if if I know
[29:16] where it's at I'll be able to find our
[29:18] house so we found the house that we
[29:20] lived in 42 years ago and our our kids
[29:23] didn't remember but I told them I said
[29:25] that's the the house we lived in that
[29:27] when that cop was chasing me and had his
[29:29] red lights behind me I said we outran
[29:32] him and run into the uh that's how my
[29:34] kids remember oh that
[29:37] house yeah I'm not going to tell you the
[29:39] rest of the story but he never caught me
[29:41] and and I was a bad influence I repented
[29:43] to my kids at that time but it was just
[29:46] a headlight and I knew he was going to
[29:47] try to pull me over for a headlight cuz
[29:51] I had just replace the headlight because
[29:53] back there they got gravel roads with
[29:55] and how many of you have had to replace
[29:58] a broken headlight uh I mean that
[30:02] happens back there on gravel roads out
[30:04] here when was the last time he replaced
[30:05] the headline you don't do it for years
[30:08] you'll you'll buy a new car before you
[30:10] replace it anyway anyway so uh I
[30:14] repented and and my kids they they know
[30:17] better to outrun a police
[30:20] officer
[30:21] um Friday night we had dinner just to
[30:25] not take time Friday night we had dinner
[30:28] with some of the saints that we had uh
[30:31] come in contact with there and Silsby
[30:33] and been their Pastor uh 42 years ago
[30:36] and we had dinner at Bob and Camille
[30:38] Decker's home in Sour Lake and uh uh
[30:43] then they had their children Robbie Lynn
[30:46] Sanders and Richard and his wife and
[30:49] some of their children and and uh
[30:52] different ones and we just had a um a
[30:55] wonderful time of reminiscing
[30:58] 42 years
[30:59] ago and everything and I think what is
[31:03] amazing is it's almost like you're
[31:06] transported out of time and you walk
[31:10] back and hear where's the old school
[31:13] where's the old house where's this and
[31:15] that then when you meet everybody how
[31:18] did everybody get so old then you look

[38:41] Revelation you've given for us Lord God
[38:44] may your name be glorified Lord once
[38:46] again tonight in Jesus Christ's name we
[38:48] pray amen and amen so thank you musician
[38:52] God bless you all so we will go directly
[38:55] to the word of God tonight and I believe
[38:57] believe that this is our purpose is to
[39:00] worship and to magnify the word tonight
[39:04] so I would like you to turn with me in
[39:07] the Book of Job uh two portion of
[39:10] scripture so in the Book of Job and we
[39:13] can see the Book of Job that is uh we
[39:16] can found it before the book of
[39:19] Easter and uh Ezra and
[39:23] Nehemiah and we know that
[39:25] God put this scripture in chronological
[39:29] order amen so isra and nayah which is
[39:32] types of the
[39:34] restoration and the Book of Easter and
[39:36] we can see that after the restoration
[39:39] Easter was being revealed which is our
[39:41] type in this last days so
[39:44] after the revelation of Easter there
[39:47] comes the
[39:48] resurrection then the book of PS which
[39:51] is the new
[39:52] song so the Book of Job so this is not
[39:55] uh we can say Resurrection or Easter
[39:59] messages and we know that the
[40:01] resurrection is everyday
[40:04] Resurrection amen Book of Job chapter 19
[40:07] verse 25-
[40:13] 27 so it says for I know that my
[40:16] redeemer leaveth amen so it is a
[40:21] positive confession I know I not hoping
[40:26] I am not doubting but I
[40:30] know and that he shall stand at the
[40:33] latter day upon the Earth and though
[40:36] after my skin worm destroyed this body
[40:39] yet in my flesh I shall see God Amen
[40:43] whom I shall see for
[40:45] myself personal
[40:48] revelation I don't care what anybody
[40:51] else see amen but it is his personal
[40:55] revelation when I shall see for myself
[40:58] and my eyes Shall Behold and not another
[41:02] though my Reigns be consumed within me
[41:05] so re means Eternal
[41:08] organs remember that how Lazarus body
[41:11] went into Decay prior to
[41:14] Resurrection so job here has received a
[41:17] revelation of that
[41:19] Resurrection notice that he had a
[41:23] Confident come into him in that he knew
[41:27] that he had power within him that would
[41:31] Quicken and raise his body I know my
[41:35] redeemer leaveth so in the Book of
[41:37] Romans chapter
[41:44] 8 uh verse
[41:49] 11 but if the spirit of him that raised
[41:53] up Jesus from the dead dwells in you
[41:56] yeah he that rais up Christ from the
[41:59] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[42:03] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[42:07] you and may the Lord add a blessing upon
[42:10] the reading of his
[42:12] word and we want to know of a certainty
[42:16] of what the even is that we have the
[42:18] same Spirit dwelling in us that raise up
[42:22] Jesus am because that will also bring us
[42:25] confidence that our mortal bodies will
[42:30] be changed in this hour and put on
[42:34] immortality and the message of the hour
[42:37] made known to us that day amen so we
[42:42] will go back in the Matthew chapter 28
[42:46] the last chapter of Matthew chapter
[42:51] 28 with the
[42:54] title in your Bible the rest
[42:57] resurrection of Jesus Christ and the
[43:00] event of that
[43:02] day and we know that he is the same
[43:05] yesterday today and forever whatever
[43:07] happened then is still happening now
[43:11] because there is always a pattern so the
[43:14] title is the resurrection of Jesus
[43:17] Christ and the event on that day so we
[43:21] will start in Matthew chap 28: 1-2 in
[43:25] the end of the Sabbath at it began to
[43:27] Don toward the first day of the week I
[43:29] don't know if I already preached
[43:32] this but if I
[43:36] did thank you it's all
[43:40] right the scripture say verily verily I
[43:43] say unto
[43:48] you so my title tonight is the
[43:50] quickening power so we need quickening
[43:53] power
[43:55] tonight amen to keep us on
[43:58] fire I know the cold weather is coming
[44:00] in but we need fire amen we can we need
[44:04] quickening power in the end of the
[44:08] Sabbath as it began to D toward the
[44:11] first de day of the week Came Mary
[44:13] Magdalene and the other Mary to see the
[44:16] simple C and we know if we can type it
[44:19] today after the Sabbath which is after
[44:21] the seventh day after the seven Church
[44:23] Ages come the first day amen which is
[44:26] the eth day which is the Eternal day
[44:29] amen and the first one that receive or
[44:32] see the resurrection was Mary Magdalene
[44:35] and
[44:38] Mary which women types the church and
[44:42] Christ has his church amen and church
[44:45] mean eclesia the callout one so the
[44:48] first one that recognize the
[44:49] resurrection are the cold out ones so
[44:53] this message the 8 Day message is the
[44:55] message that will return back where we
[44:58] came from amen amen so the message of
[45:01] the hour doesn't put us into another
[45:03] denomination but the message of the hour
[45:06] point back to where we came from just
[45:09] like Jesus Christ I came from God and
[45:11] I'll go back to God this is the message
[45:14] of the hour so why the first one that
[45:17] meet or see the resurrection was the
[45:19] Church of the Living
[45:21] God denomination cannot see it but the
[45:24] bride will see it in the last days amen
[45:28] and behold there was a great earthquake
[45:30] for the angel of the Lord descended from
[45:33] heaven and came and rolled back the
[45:35] Stone from the door and sat upon him if
[45:38] there is an angel descended during the
[45:42] time and roll back the stone of the tub
[45:44] in order to reveal Christ there is a
[45:46] descending angel in our day that roll
[45:49] back the seal in order to reveal
[45:52] Christ and he is no seal and who is no
[45:56] seal Christ no seal that is being
[45:58] revealed in our day hallelujah what a
[46:02] mighty revelation of this three
[46:04] women Hallelujah so notice the first
[46:08] thing that happened as part of the
[46:10] resurrection of Christ there was women
[46:13] an angel descending
[46:15] amen very good then the second one Jesus
[46:19] Christ
[46:20] himself
[46:23] appear then the third part there was a
[46:26] commission
[46:27] go and tell my disciple it is the same
[46:31] thing happening today the mighty angel
[46:34] came down with the message of the hour
[46:37] then he himself reveal unto his
[46:42] bride then there is a commission take
[46:45] the book and hear it thou must prophesy
[46:49] again our prophesying is a prophetic
[46:53] Ministry amen We Don't Preach about do
[46:56] this and do that do this and do that we
[46:58] preach about who we are because if you
[47:01] don't know who you are you cannot act
[47:04] according but if you know who you are
[47:07] you can act accordingly and the message
[47:09] of the hour reveal to you who you are
[47:13] you are Sons and Daughters of
[47:17] God you need to believe it because we
[47:19] have the message directly addressed to
[47:23] each and every one of us
[47:27] so three things so that is in the way in
[47:30] the early days a message churches
[47:31] receive Revelations of the
[47:34] Resurrection that's why the Revelation
[47:37] is
[47:40] Sovereign sometimes God reveal it and
[47:45] sometimes
[47:47] others later
[47:49] on so that creates a lot of
[47:53] commotion even in the
[47:55] disciples they they don't believe the
[47:57] report of Mary and mag Mary and
[48:00] Magdalene and Mary they don't believe
[48:02] the
[48:03] report in this last day it take the Lord
[48:06] Jesus Christ himself to reveal the word
[48:10] we cannot convince one another that
[48:12] there is a message of the hour but
[48:14] unless God himself reveal it to you you
[48:17] can never understand the message of the
[48:19] hour it is the grace of God in this last
[48:21] days he is going to reveal himself to
[48:24] you
[48:28] look at Thomas he he refused to believe
[48:31] the testimony of the 10
[48:36] disciples because we have also met an
[48:39] angels in these last days so he is the
[48:41] one that's going to reveal
[48:43] himself so that no one can get
[48:49] Glory out of this message of the hour
[48:52] all glory belongs to God
[48:57] if we preach we are just a messenger
[49:00] nothing
[49:01] else
[49:03] Hallelujah so in the message the Easter
[49:07] seal he
[49:09] said look at the Millions on Earth that
[49:11] didn't receive it when Jesus was
[49:15] here Millions he's speaking about
[49:18] Millions didn't even
[49:20] know that he was
[49:25] here can we say the same
[49:28] today millions of people didn't know the
[49:30] message of the
[49:32] hour the prophet was sent he was gone
[49:36] and no one
[49:37] knows what is
[49:42] happening look at the Millions on Earth
[49:44] that didn't receive it when Jesus was
[49:48] here so remember the the evidence is
[49:51] connected with receiving the word of
[49:54] your day that is what he is talking
[49:56] about about but how thankful that we
[49:59] should be this morning to know that we
[50:02] have the direct evidence and the Bible
[50:07] proof we need to be thankful we have a
[50:09] direct evidence and Bible proof that we
[50:13] are included in that great Resurrection
[50:17] morning coming that great Easter morning
[50:20] he's speaking of the great Easter of the
[50:23] day of the resurrection of the seven
[50:24] Church ages of the sleeping Saints
[50:27] yes this Resurrection this greatness has
[50:31] already begun it started within a people
[50:34] that on the earth now by the revelations
[50:36] of the word of that hour the
[50:39] resurrection started with you and
[50:43] I what is it it is Christ making himself
[50:47] known again to the believer of the
[50:51] ages seeking out his own sheep that will
[50:55] hear his voice
[51:00] he said we have the earnest of
[51:04] it right now in our mortal bodies we
[51:09] have the earnest in our mortal bodies
[51:12] the predestinated ones are the
[51:16] first of
[51:19] course to be
[51:22] quickened when the Holy Spirit comes to
[51:25] claim its own
[51:27] and how does he claim its own by
[51:29] revealing himself personally to his
[51:32] elect in his age Hallelujah this message
[51:36] is directly for each one of
[51:39] us to the predestinated
[51:48] seat can we think of something else but
[51:51] to praise God Amen than
[51:55] Lord if you have something to thankful
[51:58] to be thankful to be grateful it is the
[52:02] message of the hour to let you know who
[52:04] you are even though how poor we are
[52:07] whatever situation we are in letting you
[52:11] know that you are part of him is
[52:15] enough to say Thank You Lord is enough
[52:18] to be
[52:20] grateful sir for out of millions of
[52:23] people we are the chosen one
[52:27] at his resurrection he said that we have
[52:30] the earnest of it right now in our
[52:32] mortal bodies the predestinate one on
[52:34] the first of
[52:38] course you are the
[52:41] first before he reveal himself to others
[52:45] he reveal himself first to his
[52:49] elected and we have the evidence in our
[52:51] molter body when we receive the
[52:54] quickening power we become a new Creator
[52:58] in
[52:59] Christ we are no longer who we are but
[53:03] we become a new Creator in
[53:06] Christ but Satan is always accusing us
[53:10] you are this you are that you are this
[53:12] you are that but he is accusing you of
[53:16] your
[53:18] past he don't recognize your
[53:21] present at the present you are a new
[53:24] Creator in Christ Jesus
[53:26] covered by his blood and whatever
[53:29] accusation he had in you God don't
[53:32] listen to it
[53:34] anymore because God see his blood
[53:39] Co this is what he's doing right now
[53:42] he's claiming You and I by revealing his
[53:44] word to us and the word is a
[53:48] sin so turn it be in the Book of
[53:52] John in the Book of
[53:55] John we can read it he is an eagle and
[54:00] the eagle
[54:01] anointing in the Book of John you cannot
[54:04] read about
[54:06] Parables you cannot read
[54:09] about
[54:10] prophecy but in the Book of John it is
[54:14] always present tense
[54:18] amen he said all things that the father
[54:21] had are
[54:25] mind it was was a direct
[54:27] message no more prophecy no more history
[54:32] no more Parables it was
[54:36] revealed all things that the father had
[54:39] are
[54:40] mind whether you believe it or not but
[54:43] the Bride of Jesus Christ believe
[54:46] it therefore I said
[54:49] I who you going to believe the
[54:53] report it is he himself speaking
[54:56] revealing
[54:58] himself that he shall take of mine I
[55:01] shall show it unto you in other words
[55:04] reveal the secret of the word to you
[55:07] that is what he has done
[55:10] doing a little while and ye shall not
[55:13] see
[55:15] me his
[55:17] physical
[55:18] body you can no longer see his physical
[55:22] body and again a little while and you
[55:25] shall see see me yes because I go to the
[55:30] father a little while you shall not see
[55:33] me you will not see his physical
[55:36] body and again a little while and ye
[55:39] shall see me and this seeing is
[55:43] understanding but now you will
[55:46] understand him by the way he revealed
[55:48] himself according to his word not in the
[55:50] physical body but by the revelation of
[55:54] his word we can see Christ to the word
[55:57] in this last
[56:00] days in John
[56:03] 14 verse 18 He said I will not leave you
[56:09] comfortless I will come to you do you
[56:13] believe
[56:15] it so we are not
[56:18] widower we have a husband amen who
[56:21] promise I will not leave you
[56:24] comfortless I will come to you yes a
[56:26] little while and the world see me no
[56:29] more but ye see me he's talking about
[56:33] another way of seeing which means
[56:39] understanding because I live you shall
[56:41] live
[56:43] also and at that
[56:47] day ye shall
[56:49] know at that day you shall
[56:54] know you will know and you need to
[56:59] know this is the message of the
[57:02] hour even though you don't like it you
[57:06] will know and you need to
[57:10] know this is the Revelation
[57:13] time he couldn't be in them in the form
[57:16] of Jesus of Nazareth but he could be in
[57:19] them in the form of the revelations of
[57:21] the word which is what he has always
[57:25] from the beginning
[57:27] because in the Book of John he said in
[57:29] the beginning was the word and the Word
[57:31] was with God and the Word was God and
[57:34] the Word was made flesh am and dwelt
[57:38] among
[57:41] us he was the word first and a word
[57:45] really is just a thought being
[57:48] expressed and so the thought of God
[57:51] became the word of God and the word of
[57:53] God became fleshed and dwelt Among Us in
[57:55] the form of Jesus of
[57:59] Nazareth
[58:01] but the same Jesus is not in the form of
[58:05] Nazareth
[58:07] today he is in the form of his
[58:11] bride because God was in
[58:14] Christ now it was Christ in many member
[58:18] body Hallelujah and the restoration back
[58:22] to the Garden of Eden restoration back
[58:24] hallelujah amen amen she'll be looking
[58:27] for
[58:29] God here is God
[58:34] sitting because God is a
[58:37] word a thought being
[58:43] expressed Satan will let you doubt
[58:50] it he tried to point you to your
[58:54] physical place how can you be God you
[58:58] commit this you commit that you commit
[58:59] this you commit that but it doesn't
[59:04] take away the realization the reality
[59:09] that you are
[59:10] God's because when the word of God comes
[59:14] to you you are God's because the word of
[59:17] God is being made manifest and we have a
[59:19] portion to fulfill we can
[59:23] create what we can create we can can
[59:26] create an
[59:27] atmosphere Hallelujah if you are sad if
[59:30] you're troubl if you're depressed if you
[59:32] an anxiety you recognize who you are and
[59:36] you can create an atmosphere to come
[59:40] down if you are sick you can create an
[59:43] atmosphere and say hallelujah the Lord
[59:46] God heal all thy
[59:48] diseases because Jehovah Gyra in the Old
[59:52] Testament the the the the seven compound
[59:56] name of Jehovah Jehovah Gyra Jehovah
[59:59] nessi Jehovah Shalom Jehovah Rapa is now
[1:00:03] made manifest in one person and that is
[1:00:06] the Lord Jesus Christ if you want
[1:00:09] healing is in the Lord Jesus Christ if
[1:00:12] you are deliverer it is in Theus Christ
[1:00:15] if you have Redemption it is in the
[1:00:17] person of Jesus Christ the seven
[1:00:19] compound name is now manifest in the
[1:00:22] name of Jesus that's why there is power
[1:00:25] in his name there is healing in his name
[1:00:27] there is Miracle in his name there is
[1:00:30] salvation in his
[1:00:32] name there is no other name given among
[1:00:36] men which can in which we can be saved
[1:00:39] in the name of Jesus Christ because the
[1:00:41] Old Testament that Jehovah of the Old
[1:00:44] Testament is now Jesus of the
[1:00:51] new so don't be confused
[1:00:56] as brother Ron preached we are the final
[1:01:00] voice to the final
[1:01:02] AGS God is relying on you and
[1:01:06] me because we are holding eternal life
[1:01:09] for others they may not be in the
[1:01:12] rupor but the way you act the way you
[1:01:15] deliver the word you can impart it the
[1:01:17] life to
[1:01:18] them because if you live the life of
[1:01:21] Christ they become hunger and thirst in
[1:01:25] their life to to become
[1:01:30] you and by doing so they are good to us
[1:01:35] they can give us water they can help us
[1:01:38] amen and it will give them eternal life
[1:01:41] they may not be in the rupture because
[1:01:43] the Bride is a special class of
[1:01:49] people but eternal life for God so loved
[1:01:52] the world that he gave his only begotten
[1:01:55] son that whosoever believeth on him
[1:01:58] should not perish that is the
[1:02:00] default because
[1:02:02] God is not willing that anyone should
[1:02:05] perish but come unto
[1:02:08] repentance God is so
[1:02:11] gracious but for the bride we are a
[1:02:14] special class of
[1:02:19] people in the Easter seal if we are
[1:02:22] ordained to be on the ground because we
[1:02:25] are born and come to the word speaking
[1:02:27] Lies We are not ordained to be an
[1:02:31] angel
[1:02:34] yes if you are ordained to be on the
[1:02:38] ground like the eagle walking in the
[1:02:40] chicken nest if you're ordained on that
[1:02:43] ground the holy spirit is here to find
[1:02:49] you he is here to find
[1:02:52] you and when he find you you Rec
[1:02:55] recognize the call there is the voice of
[1:02:58] God in the seventh angel when he shall
[1:03:01] begin to sound
[1:03:04] yes the mystery of God which you are
[1:03:08] part of will be revealed in these last
[1:03:12] days you know the hour you're living you
[1:03:15] know that these things are supposed to
[1:03:18] happen yes it's going to
[1:03:22] happen because now it is a prophecy yes
[1:03:26] and there must be a people to fulfill
[1:03:29] prophecy just like when he said Elijah I
[1:03:32] will send to you
[1:03:33] Elijah Elijah is a prophecy yes but
[1:03:37] there is also a people that will fulfill
[1:03:40] that prophecy the you in that prophecy
[1:03:43] is you are the people of the
[1:03:47] prophecy if there is a prophecy there
[1:03:49] must be a people to fulfill the prophecy
[1:03:51] and we are the Fulfillment of that
[1:03:53] prophecy whether you like it or not how
[1:03:56] come you can go
[1:03:59] along in the message of the
[1:04:02] hour we may have suffering we have so

[1:04:33] manifestation it will
[1:04:36] manifest whether you like it in his time
[1:04:38] and it season it will manifest itself
[1:04:41] because there is a life within the sin
[1:04:44] and if you are the SE of God you will
[1:04:46] manifest God which is the word in this
[1:04:52] last he said you know that these things

[1:09:52] singing guitars and everything but every
[1:09:55] time they we have a group singing I'm
[1:09:57] always on the other side because my

[1:10:29] the prophets I sure love good singing
[1:10:31] but one of the greatest thing that I
[1:10:33] ever had enjoyment is meditation in the
[1:10:37] word of
[1:10:39] God that is the most important thing to
[1:10:42] meditate upon the word of God to me
[1:10:45] there's one thing that's fundamentally
[1:10:48] and one thing that's sure and one thing
[1:10:50] that's infallable that's the word of
[1:10:54] God right to me all Christian them must
[1:10:57] be based upon that one solid thing yes
[1:11:02] meditate upon his
[1:11:03] word the word of God that's the
[1:11:06] foundation that's what we're here for
[1:11:08] tonight is to Fellowship around his word
[1:11:11] and meditate upon God that's where
[1:11:15] fellowship with God takes place it is in
[1:11:19] the realm of your
[1:11:21] thoughts and his
[1:11:24] thought in Perfect Harmony am just like
[1:11:28] in the Book of Joshua chap 1:8 this book
[1:11:32] of the law shall not depart out of thy
[1:11:35] mouth and if we can bring it in our day
[1:11:39] yes this open book shall not depart out
[1:11:42] of thy
[1:11:44] mouth but thou shall meditate therein at
[1:11:48] night listen to the
[1:11:50] tapes read the word of God day and night
[1:11:53] meditate Amen Let not this law the book
[1:11:56] of law the open book in our day let us
[1:12:00] the depart and just be a
[1:12:05] display and thou mayest observe
[1:12:08] according to all that is written therein
[1:12:10] for then thou shallal make thy way
[1:12:13] prosperous if you want to be prosperous
[1:12:15] meditate upon the word of God and this
[1:12:20] Prosperity is not like
[1:12:23] a financial Pro Prosperity you can say
[1:12:27] that but this Prosperity is the
[1:12:31] Revelation your relationship intimacy
[1:12:35] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:38] we can prosper by the
[1:12:40] revelation of who he is and who we
[1:12:44] are we can prosper in our Revelation and
[1:12:48] then Thou shalt have good
[1:12:50] success we can have success success to
[1:12:54] overcome this trial success for anxiety
[1:12:57] success for and depression success for
[1:13:00] anything because you meditate on the
[1:13:02] Promises of the word of
[1:13:04] God and Paul said I can do all things
[1:13:08] through Christ the revealed word in this
[1:13:10] hour this is the time that we need to
[1:13:12] speak the word speak the word hallelujah
[1:13:16] claim your
[1:13:19] benefits you are the mouthpiece of
[1:13:23] God the don't listen to
[1:13:26] Satan he's just a
[1:13:29] block the more he say you are this you
[1:13:31] are that you say I know I do this and do
[1:13:34] that but I still I am a Son of
[1:13:36] God you have question with
[1:13:39] that bring it to him oh he always accuse
[1:13:42] you this one this one this one oh I know
[1:13:48] that you think I know that I know all
[1:13:50] about it but still I am the son of God
[1:13:55] what can you say about
[1:13:58] that you need to bring it back to him I
[1:14:01] am a Son of God how about
[1:14:04] you you are a son of pric but I am a Son
[1:14:07] of
[1:14:10] God
[1:14:12] hallelujah in the Book of Job he said
[1:14:15] verse 1 verse 6 now there was a day when
[1:14:18] the sons of God came to present them
[1:14:21] themselves before the
[1:14:23] Lord and Satan came also among
[1:14:29] them he wants to
[1:14:33] join and the Lord said unto Satan whence
[1:14:37] comest thou and Satan answered the Lord
[1:14:39] and said from going to and fro in the
[1:14:42] earth and from walking up and down to
[1:14:47] it people with no
[1:14:51] business is going from east to west and
[1:14:54] south nothing to do
[1:14:56] do he has nothing to do so he just room
[1:15:00] around goon here G up to another talk
[1:15:04] about somebody here talk about somebody
[1:15:07] there if you notice he's going to and
[1:15:10] fro without he is doing
[1:15:14] nothing until
[1:15:16] God tell him have you considered my my
[1:15:20] son job so every trial that comes our
[1:15:23] way it is with a perm Miss with God God
[1:15:27] know what he's doing and all way to to
[1:15:30] to build our character is to Tri he
[1:15:33] allow
[1:15:35] Satan to do
[1:15:40] that so in Eden God would come down in
[1:15:43] the cool of the day and walk with men
[1:15:45] and have fellowship with men upon the
[1:15:47] Earth
[1:15:49] amen he just came down and just
[1:15:52] fellowship with his sons and
[1:15:53] daughters that it's a good thing but
[1:15:55] there was but here we see Satan is among
[1:15:58] the son so we're trying to walk with
[1:16:00] them upon the Earth because he wants to
[1:16:01] be
[1:16:02] worshiped he wants to insert himself he
[1:16:06] wants to become somebody he wants to be
[1:16:09] a good preacher he wants to be a good
[1:16:11] Deacon he wants to be a good song
[1:16:15] leader he wants to be somebody in the
[1:16:21] church he wants to have fellowship with
[1:16:23] men and Pro object his thought into men
[1:16:27] and shap man's thinking to become
[1:16:29] submissive to his will and desire so
[1:16:33] that he can rule man's heart and control
[1:16:35] his thought and be the god of men and be
[1:16:38] worshiped by men is he doing it
[1:16:41] today unless you are Sons and Daughters
[1:16:43] of God you will give
[1:16:45] in to his
[1:16:47] plan that's why the the the the thought
[1:16:51] of men are evil
[1:16:53] continually in this last days that is
[1:16:56] insanity how can the
[1:16:59] thought think about evil things
[1:17:06] continually but here was a man named job
[1:17:09] that Satan could not walk upon the Earth
[1:17:13] and fellowship with his man with his
[1:17:14] thought nor could he project his thought
[1:17:17] into job to do evil against the Lord and
[1:17:19] then it is the season that job come to a
[1:17:23] realization
[1:17:26] of the quickening power within
[1:17:30] him Satan took away his family his
[1:17:33] business and everything even his skin
[1:17:36] but during that time the quickening
[1:17:39] power Quicken his I know my redeemer
[1:17:42] live it Hallelujah God I know my
[1:17:47] redeemer live it and he shall stand at
[1:17:50] the latter day upon the
[1:17:53] earth and the thought after my skin W
[1:17:56] destroy his body yet in my flesh I shall
[1:17:58] see God whom I shall see for myself and
[1:18:01] my eyes Shall Behold and not together
[1:18:03] though my Reigns be consumed within me
[1:18:07] he has this great
[1:18:09] testimony Hallelujah am in Revelation
[1:18:13] chapter
[1:18:15] 1 verse 17 and
[1:18:17] 18 which brother
[1:18:20] Bram uh quote this when he preached the
[1:18:24] Easter seal
[1:18:26] Revelation 11:17 and when I saw him I
[1:18:31] fell at his feet as
[1:18:33] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:18:35] saying fear not I am the first and the
[1:18:40] last and I am he that liveth and was
[1:18:44] dead and behold I am alive forever more
[1:18:47] amen and have the keys of hell and of
[1:18:51] death so a key is the revelation
[1:18:55] remember that J was asked who Am I who
[1:18:58] do you say I am and some say you are
[1:19:01] Jeremiah Jeremiah and it was personally
[1:19:04] as
[1:19:06] of Peter who am I to
[1:19:09] you he said Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:19:12] of the Living
[1:19:14] God in in Matthew 11:17 and Jesus
[1:19:17] answered and said unto him blessed art
[1:19:19] thou
[1:19:21] Simon so Revelation is a blessing
[1:19:28] if you want blessing ask for Revelation
[1:19:31] because Revelation is more than anything
[1:19:34] else Simon vuna for Flesh and Blood hath
[1:19:37] not revealed it unto you but my Father
[1:19:39] which is in heaven Revelation was given
[1:19:41] by God it was not even revelation of
[1:19:45] Peter
[1:19:46] himself because flesh and blood has not
[1:19:48] revealed it to you in other words it was
[1:19:51] not your Revelation Peter but my Father
[1:19:53] which is Ty of the Holy Spirit it was
[1:19:56] him who revealed to you for we in the
[1:19:58] spirit of God shall come he will guide
[1:20:00] you into
[1:20:01] alar in Matthew 16:18 and I say unto
[1:20:04] thee that thou art Peter Upon This
[1:20:08] Rock upon this Revelation I will build
[1:20:11] my church and the gates of bell shall
[1:20:13] not prevails again it and I will give
[1:20:16] unto thee the
[1:20:18] key of the Kingdom of Heaven I will give
[1:20:22] the the key the revelation of the
[1:20:24] kingdom of heaven and he said and
[1:20:26] whatsoever thou shal bind on Earth shall
[1:20:29] be bound in heaven and whatsoever shall
[1:20:31] lose on Earth will be loose in heaven
[1:20:34] the key of
[1:20:36] revelation will bind and will lose
[1:20:41] people if they
[1:20:44] reject or accept the message there is
[1:20:49] binding and there is
[1:20:51] loosing because Peter was commissioned
[1:20:54] he he was given the key to the kingdom
[1:20:57] yes of
[1:21:03] Christ and the preaching of the open
[1:21:06] book will bind those who will reject it
[1:21:09] and will lose those who accepted they
[1:21:13] will be loose in darkness they will be
[1:21:15] loose un belief amen so that's why Paul
[1:21:19] got said in in 18 but though we are an
[1:21:23] angel from heaven preach any other the
[1:21:24] gospel unto you than that which we have
[1:21:26] preached unto you let him be a curse
[1:21:29] there will be a
[1:21:31] binding If You Preach another gospel If
[1:21:34] You Preach another Revelation outside of
[1:21:36] the revealed word of God let him be a
[1:21:43] curse and Paul repeated it verse n and
[1:21:48] we said before so I say now again yes if
[1:21:54] any man preach any other gospel any
[1:21:57] Revelation any interpretation man-made
[1:22:02] Doctrine unto you than that ye have
[1:22:05] received let him be a
[1:22:09] curse so the key of hell and death is a
[1:22:12] revelation that will given to a people
[1:22:14] in the last days because there is a
[1:22:17] promise that there would be a people on
[1:22:19] Earth in the last day that would not see
[1:22:23] them it is a
[1:22:25] promise Romans 8 but if the spirit of
[1:22:29] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:22:31] dwells in
[1:22:32] you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:22:35] dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body
[1:22:38] by his spirit that we can Quicken make
[1:22:42] alive it will change this Mortal into
[1:22:47] immortality
[1:22:51] yes quickening power is the key that
[1:22:53] unlock
[1:22:55] mortality to a people in this
[1:22:58] age the word Quicken is to cause to live
[1:23:02] that which was dead or to make
[1:23:05] alive or to give
[1:23:08] life OB seed Quicken into life
[1:23:12] germinating springing up growing so to
[1:23:15] Quicken the seed is to germatize it to
[1:23:19] Life by sun and water so they speak of
[1:23:22] process that take place cuz something to
[1:23:24] live to be
[1:23:26] quickened we need to lay in the presence
[1:23:28] of the
[1:23:30] son to be matured we cannot be matured
[1:23:34] in the light of the candle of the seven
[1:23:36] Church ages we are beyond the candle
[1:23:40] ages we are beyond the candle light we
[1:23:44] are now living in the Sun the rising of
[1:23:47] the Sun the rising of the
[1:23:50] Su to take away the greenness out of us
[1:23:54] amen so the spirit that will Quicken
[1:23:57] your moral body in this hour begins by
[1:23:59] the process of God shining the light of
[1:24:01] the word of this hour into the seed of
[1:24:03] what he plac Within
[1:24:05] You by
[1:24:08] predestination so we cannot get away for
[1:24:10] this
[1:24:12] predestination your destiny is already
[1:24:15] being
[1:24:16] prepared thank the
[1:24:19] Lord and whether we like it if we are
[1:24:22] predestinated we will align
[1:24:26] to the
[1:24:28] seed that was quickened in this last
[1:24:35] days in the message Easter
[1:24:38] seal continuing have I ever told you
[1:24:41] anything in the name of the Lord but
[1:24:43] what
[1:24:44] happened he said yeah I want to tell you
[1:24:46] about it every time has it been
[1:24:49] perfectly at the platform every time has
[1:24:51] it happened just like he said this was
[1:24:54] th set every time the prophet share uh
[1:24:58] share his vision it was always being
[1:25:03] fulfilled he fulfilled every
[1:25:07] promises he he he speaks about I stood
[1:25:10] there look over the time I seen tens and
[1:25:13] thousands of times thousand coming Young
[1:25:15] And Men Women running throwing their
[1:25:17] arms around me screaming I look back and
[1:25:20] see myself laying on the bed oh Lord let
[1:25:22] me look the past the curtain of
[1:25:26] time so is's sharing his experience
[1:25:30] beyond the curtain of
[1:25:33] time so there was a great Eternal youth
[1:25:38] meeting no old no Young no babies
[1:25:42] nothing because when her daughter Sheron
[1:25:45] was died she was just a little
[1:25:49] baby but when she saw it beyond the
[1:25:51] curtain of times she was already a te
[1:25:54] teenager
[1:25:56] yes and the old woman that he lead to
[1:25:59] Christ at the age of 90 when he saw it
[1:26:01] beyond the curtain of time he was a
[1:26:04] young
[1:26:06] people so if
[1:26:08] somebody tell you that he goes beyond
[1:26:11] the curtain of time and tell you that he
[1:26:14] saw an old man he saw a
[1:26:19] baby he didn't go behind the curtain of
[1:26:22] time because brother have been so any
[1:26:25] old men or
[1:26:28] babies and we know that the prophet is
[1:26:31] the yard stick of all that
[1:26:34] experiences no old men no babies only
[1:26:37] young people because when his daughter
[1:26:40] died being a baby he saw it as a young
[1:26:43] girl beautiful girl The Old Woman become
[1:26:46] a young
[1:26:47] girl that's why I
[1:26:50] always tell some of the brothers that
[1:26:54] the message found me at the age of
[1:26:58] 27 so I have never experienced what it
[1:27:02] was to be in the Youth Camp Fellowship
[1:27:06] but thank God we have a youth meeting
[1:27:08] Eternal youth meeting one of these days
[1:27:17] hallelujah so heaven we are going in is
[1:27:21] an eternal youth meeting
[1:27:25] the prophet met the Splendor of Youth
[1:27:27] when he crossed the Cur of time his
[1:27:29] account is the Y stick against which any
[1:27:33] claim of people who experience LL should
[1:27:35] be Jud that is
[1:27:39] ortic so let's continue
[1:27:42] on what is it the quickening power that
[1:27:45] will cat us away that the the great
[1:27:48] quickening
[1:27:50] power that's what I'm in Arizona for
[1:27:53] right now
[1:27:54] yes there's many people sitting here
[1:27:57] stood right here at penix and heard me
[1:28:00] tell you from this platform thus said
[1:28:03] the Lord and how many remember it now go

[1:28:31] hills for miles around like that he saw
[1:28:34] seventh angel and we know that the
[1:28:35] seventh angel was the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:38] himself the angel of the Covenant there
[1:28:41] stood seven angels and throw a sword in
[1:28:43] your hand and said go home and open the
[1:28:46] Seven Seals that are given and here they
[1:28:48] are the true mystery of marriage and
[1:28:51] divorce and serpent seed and all these
[1:28:53] things that's been fools about is thus
[1:28:56] said the Lord what it is the quickening
[1:28:58] power coming to the church making her
[1:29:02] ready this hour that we are approaching
[1:29:05] quickening power am hallelujah amen all
[1:29:08] these things that happening our
[1:29:10] generation it is for the purpose to give

[1:29:28] believe
[1:29:31] it the same tonight help us Lord to
[1:29:35] believe
[1:29:37] it I know there are so many destructions
[1:29:41] when you open the YouTube that will go
[1:29:43] against the
[1:29:45] prophet but who are
[1:29:49] they the angel of the Lord when the
[1:29:52] prophet was still a little boy he said
[1:29:54] said don't smoke Don't drink don't
[1:29:56] nothing because I prepare I prepare
[1:29:59] something for
[1:30:01] you but this preacher who was once a
[1:30:04] drunkard a sinner will go against the
[1:30:08] prophet how can you go against the
[1:30:10] prophet when the angel of the Lord
[1:30:12] prepared his body for this
[1:30:15] ministry and God fulfilled everything in
[1:30:18] his
[1:30:22] ministry she just depend on what
[1:30:24] attitude you take to it whether it's
[1:30:26] going to do you any good or not though
[1:30:29] see you have to believe that you don't
[1:30:31] believe it it won't do you one bit of
[1:30:34] good amen hallelujah amen so it's up to
[1:30:37] you but I believe as a bride of Jesus
[1:30:40] Christ as the seed of God you will
[1:30:42] always believe the word if even though
[1:30:44] if you cannot understand it if you are a
[1:30:46] seed it will Quicken the quickening
[1:30:48] power will say Amen to every word of God
[1:30:51] because you will recognize Who You Are
[1:30:54] that's
[1:30:57] true just depend on what attitude you
[1:30:59] take whether he going to do you good or
[1:31:01] not though you have to believe that you
[1:31:03] don't believe it it won't do you one bit
[1:31:06] of good how Samuel stood there before
[1:31:08] the people and said have I ever told you
[1:31:10] anything in the name of the Lord but
[1:31:12] what happened did I ever beg you for
[1:31:15] your money to live on no but we want the
[1:31:19] king anyway that's the way the church is
[1:31:21] today they want their own ideas they
[1:31:23] want their own interpretation they want
[1:31:25] their own their group they want their
[1:31:27] own understanding they want somebody
[1:31:29] that will LIF them up higher and follow
[1:31:32] a man instead of follow the way the the
[1:31:34] word of the
[1:31:37] Lord they walk right around well it just
[1:31:39] go to show the quickening power is not
[1:31:43] there if you go around and say oh I am
[1:31:46] this I am that I am this I am that the
[1:31:49] quickening power is not in
[1:31:51] there because if the quicking power is
[1:31:54] that the son can do nothing with it
[1:31:58] himself but if that queening power is
[1:32:01] there you recognize like that little
[1:32:03] Eagle that he mama that's the word that
[1:32:06] said the Lord that's what God promised
[1:32:09] that's what was for told and that's
[1:32:12] exactly what happened we're Beyond any
[1:32:14] Shadow of Doubt potentially in the
[1:32:17] resurrection right

[1:32:53] becoming invisible he's already here

[1:32:59] now don't look for him in the near
[1:33:04] future he is here right now how do you

[1:33:30] word don't look at the man look at the
[1:33:36] word the Lord Jesus is saying another
[1:33:38] word or another dimension right here

[1:34:03] or another dimension right here today in
[1:34:06] the form of the spirit his spirit is
[1:34:10] blending in with our
[1:34:16] spirit our eyes can see him because they
[1:34:20] they're physical yet unless there would
[1:34:23] something happen happened that we could
[1:34:24] see Vision but he is here just as
[1:34:28] visible just as real as he was in the
[1:34:32] day that he spoke to Mary at the
[1:34:35] grave or he met C ofas on his road to
[1:34:39] the mayus his presence is here do you
[1:34:43] believe
[1:34:44] it
[1:34:47] amen it can be filled with that felt
[1:34:51] with that inner church that's on the
[1:34:53] inside of human body called the New
[1:34:56] Birth the soul has been magnetized unto
[1:35:00] him can we say amen hallelujah his
[1:35:04] spirit is now blending with our spirit
[1:35:07] that's why we recognize our day and our
[1:35:12] [Music]
[1:35:15] message we
[1:35:17] are now the loud year is now about to
[1:35:21] close
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:26] and when you open the news it's all
[1:35:28] about why did
[1:35:30] Trump win in this
[1:35:35] election why did Trump win this
[1:35:39] election we know that Trump was elected
[1:35:44] as the
[1:35:45] 45th
[1:35:49] president and
[1:35:50] today he won as the
[1:35:55] 47th
[1:35:59] president in the
[1:36:01] US Constitution the 22nd amendment you
[1:36:05] can only run two
[1:36:14] terms his first term he was the 45th
[1:36:19] then comes Biden the 46th
[1:36:26] President we are not looking for a woman
[1:36:28] to run and waron as a
[1:36:30] president and many of the message circle
[1:36:33] is already being
[1:36:36] disappointed because what they are
[1:36:39] expecting that a powerful woman will
[1:36:43] arise but they didn't realize that
[1:36:46] prophecy was already fulfilled in Joe
[1:36:50] Biden a Roman Catholic
[1:36:54] president which is Joe
[1:36:57] Biden aligned with JF
[1:37:00] Kennedy with a vice president or maybe a
[1:37:05] vice president a woman president and
[1:37:08] during their nug he wore a purple C
[1:37:10] dress which fulfilled the six prophecy
[1:37:15] yes maybe a Roman Catholic President or
[1:37:19] a beautiful cruel woman yes
[1:37:23] isn't he so cruel yes he legalized
[1:37:27] abortion yes he legalized that a man can
[1:37:30] be a
[1:37:31] woman and a woman can be a
[1:37:33] man he legalized that a man can join the
[1:37:36] woman's
[1:37:39] Sports he confused the mind of the of
[1:37:43] the
[1:37:45] student you can choose what you want you
[1:37:47] want to be a cat you want to be an
[1:37:49] animal you want to they legalize all
[1:37:51] that a cruel woman and that fulfill the
[1:37:54] six Vision
[1:37:56] yes but now in this last days this
[1:37:59] election Trump won
[1:38:01] again the 47th
[1:38:06] president before Biden he was the 45
[1:38:09] 45th which is f which is a number of
[1:38:11] Grace Biden 46 president which is a
[1:38:16] number of 666 which is Roman
[1:38:20] Catholicism and this last Trump
[1:38:26] we have the last
[1:38:27] Trump the last
[1:38:30] [Music]
[1:38:32] term that's why in 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:38:36] 15 51 behold I show you
[1:38:40] mystery that we shall not sleep but we
[1:38:43] shall be changed in a moment in the
[1:38:45] twinkling of an eye at the last Trum
[1:38:54] at the last Trump for the trumpet shall
[1:38:56] sound and the dead shall rise rais
[1:38:59] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:39:01] the quing power is here to prepare
[1:39:06] us for this corruptable must push on
[1:39:09] incorruptible incorruption and this
[1:39:13] Mortal must put on
[1:39:17] immortality we have the last
[1:39:21] Trump remember that
[1:39:25] Trump by just a little word that they
[1:39:30] stand God back it up and he won the
[1:39:34] election because he stand by the word of
[1:39:36] God just a little word and God back him
[1:39:40] up how about you the Bride of Jesus
[1:39:43] Christ you have the word in this last
[1:39:45] days if God back up thr to win then how
[1:39:48] about you the bride which is the word of
[1:39:50] God in this last day you have the word
[1:39:52] of God in this last day
[1:39:54] we don't say that this is the this is
[1:39:56] our sign but the prophet said in the
[1:39:57] message
[1:40:00] countdown whatever the achievement of
[1:40:02] this word is God is doing the same in
[1:40:06] his
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:10] spiritual when they say
[1:40:13] peace and
[1:40:15] prosperity then sudden Destruction
[1:40:18] come isn't Trump saying we will restore
[1:40:22] America again again but we need to be
[1:40:25] careful this must be the last
[1:40:27] year before the going
[1:40:29] out we don't wait for that purple to
[1:40:32] manifest as a president because that is
[1:40:35] already past tense that is already
[1:40:38] history and we don't expect something
[1:40:42] now that Trump is the President we need
[1:40:44] to be careful maybe this
[1:40:47] is the time for us to go closer to God
[1:40:52] to go be
[1:40:54] here we don't expect that America to
[1:40:57] prosper again are you expecting
[1:41:00] prosperity in Trump
[1:41:02] Administration we are expecting for the
[1:41:04] body change because the quickening power
[1:41:07] was already given to us in order for us
[1:41:09] for this body to change from corruptible
[1:41:13] into
[1:41:14] corruptible and that purple was already
[1:41:18] fulfilled and the prophet said I think
[1:41:21] it is in the hidden life he said that
[1:41:24] every prophecy has a
[1:41:27] dual or a compound
[1:41:30] meaning we know that
[1:41:33] purple is a color of
[1:41:38] royalty Revelation chapter
[1:41:42] 17 but when I open the message at Thy
[1:41:46] word the purple also is a color
[1:41:50] according to the law of adoption is also
[1:41:54] a
[1:41:58] purple did you catch it or maybe not I
[1:42:02] want to repeat it again the purple is a
[1:42:05] compound meaning and Kamala Harris
[1:42:08] fulfilled the scripture but for the
[1:42:11] Bride of Jesus Christ under the adoption
[1:42:13] message after our children we are
[1:42:17] Hallelujah we are ready to be adopted
[1:42:19] because we talk about him we we act like
[1:42:21] him we talk like him and the father will
[1:42:24] will will request all bring the
[1:42:28] robe and that robe is the robe colored
[1:42:31] purple
[1:42:33] Rob at TH word maybe and when the boy
[1:42:36] proved to be right boy the message at
[1:42:39] Thy
[1:42:40] word which in our case is the holy
[1:42:44] spirit that takes word to the father and
[1:42:46] gives a report of what we
[1:42:49] do then if we be found faithful for so
[1:42:52] long like the child was then he was
[1:42:55] taken out in public square and a purple
[1:42:59] robe was put on him there was a law of
[1:43:04] adoption Hallelujah that is the law of
[1:43:07] adoption that the purple color parallel
[1:43:10] to adoption the law of adoption we are
[1:43:13] the adopted Sons and Daughters of God we
[1:43:16] are predestinated unto
[1:43:18] adoption that's why we speak like him we
[1:43:21] act like him we decide I like
[1:43:24] him and we say thank you Lord let us
[1:43:27] stand to our
[1:43:32] feet and may the
[1:43:34] Lord may the Lord encourage you the
[1:43:38] quickening power here is to Quicken us
[1:43:40] to prepare ourself we are not looking
[1:43:43] praise
[1:43:44] God for a better
[1:43:47] economy but we are looking for the
[1:43:49] changing of our body everything is ready
[1:43:52] for
[1:43:53] [Music]
[1:43:56] and the Victory of Donald Trump is just
[1:44:00] an
[1:44:01] indication that our time is too short
[1:44:05] amen God bless you let us pray for one
[1:44:08] another and encourage one another our
[1:44:10] time is too
[1:44:11] short we need to encourage another the
[1:44:15] time has
[1:44:17] come at the twigling of an
[1:44:20] eye amen those who are dead in shall
[1:44:23] rise first that we which are alive and
[1:44:25] remain shall be
[1:44:27] quickened from corruptible into
