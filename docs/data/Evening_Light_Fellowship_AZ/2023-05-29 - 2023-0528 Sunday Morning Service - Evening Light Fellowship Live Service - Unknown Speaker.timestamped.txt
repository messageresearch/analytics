[49:07] the master of the Wind
[49:09] we know him by name
[49:12] and because we know him by name we can
[49:14] call upon his name in a time of trouble
[49:16] if you have a need upon your heart how
[49:19] about you make it known to the Lord by
[49:21] an uplifted hand as we pray
[49:24] Heavenly Father
[49:26] this building is full of needs Lord your
[49:30] children are approaching you with
[49:32] uplifted hands father with many desires
[49:35] and needs upon their hearts and Lord we
[49:38] are completely depending upon the father
[49:42] we're not depending upon our own
[49:45] righteousness we're not depending upon
[49:47] our own works or our own abilities but
[49:50] we're depending upon the finished work
[49:52] of Calvary and so by Faith Lord we say
[49:55] meet our needs Father Like Only You Can
[49:58] your Prophet taught us he said
[50:01] that you can do nothing more for us than

[50:05] asking that Faith would arise in our
[50:07] hearts faith in the finished work Lord
[50:10] faith in the written word father that we
[50:13] may know that you are alive and that you
[50:16] are with us that our needs would be met

[50:43] read verse 25 and is certainly an honor
[50:47] to be here this morning to minister the
[50:50] word of God and um we had a a nice
[50:54] wedding there on on Friday brother

[51:24] that was kind of interesting the boys
[51:26] they all came out and you know
[51:29] one of them did a cartwheel and the
[51:31] other one did a backflip when the
[51:32] wedding party's coming out and stuff and
[51:34] and I and I told the brother the people
[51:37] at our table I said watch Isaac's going
[51:39] to do a a rollover and sure enough he
[51:42] comes out and he rolls over
[51:46] I'm just a good guesser is all
[51:50] and so brother Ron asked me to greet the
[51:52] people and uh and just you know he
[51:55] really wanted to be here there's one
[51:57] thing about brother Ron is this uh he's
[51:59] got no reverse
[52:01] in his vehicle all he knows is forward
[52:04] he's got no white flag and uh so for
[52:08] brother Ron not to be here you know he's
[52:11] he's pretty sick in body so we'll just
[52:14] raise him up I'm gonna claim that God
[52:16] will touch him for a speedy recovery and
[52:18] uh we'll be expecting to see him and
[52:20] sister Sandy here on Wednesday night
[52:23] Proverbs chapter 4 and verse
[52:28] 25.
[52:31] it says let thine eyes look right on and
[52:35] let thine eyelids look straight before
[52:38] thee let's read 26 Ponder the path of
[52:42] thy feet and let all thy ways be
[52:45] established
[52:47] turn not to the right hand nor to the
[52:50] left and remove thy foot from Evil amen
[52:55] was he trying to teach us here don't be
[52:57] looking to the right don't be looking to
[52:59] the left but look directly straight
[53:02] before us amen first Samuel
[53:05] chapter 12
[53:09] verses 20 and 21.
[53:17] also so I don't forget if the minister
[53:21] Brethren after the service is over we're
[53:25] going to have prayer for little Josiah
[53:27] and Megan and Ben in the back corner
[53:29] here after we minister so just in case I
[53:32] forget so I can be remembered that would
[53:35] be fantastic brother James and brother
[53:38] Warren and brother Mike and brother
[53:40] martin so just uh be ready for that
[53:43] after the service first Samuel 12 and
[53:47] verse 20 and it says in Samuel said unto
[53:50] the people fear not ye have done all
[53:53] this wickedness yet turn not aside from
[53:56] following
[53:58] the Lord but serve the Lord with all
[54:01] your heart and turn ye not aside for
[54:05] then should you go after vain things
[54:07] which cannot profit nor deliver for they
[54:10] are vain amen let's just pray one more
[54:13] time father I ask for your anointing
[54:16] this morning I pray for your inspiration
[54:19] of the Holy Spirit Lord we are
[54:22] completely depending upon you Lord to
[54:24] take the word to break the bread of life
[54:27] to our hearts father so I pray that
[54:30] myself that I would be anointed and
[54:33] inspired that the congregation Lord
[54:35] would be anointed and inspired father
[54:39] that we could take the word and apply it
[54:41] to our lives father God that we might
[54:44] live a life that is pleasing today we
[54:46] love you in Jesus Christ's name amen
[54:49] amen you may be seated
[54:56] I would like to
[54:58] title my sermon this morning staying
[55:01] focused in times like these
[55:05] staying focused in times like these if
[55:08] there was ever a Time
[55:10] in the history of the world that would
[55:14] cause the children of God to lose their
[55:16] focus I would say it's right now
[55:20] we find that there's many things in life
[55:22] that
[55:23] bombards us on a daily basis and
[55:27] of an assurance we can say that we are
[55:30] living in Satan's Eden
[55:32] and Satan has had six thousand plus
[55:34] years to perfect his Eden and we can say
[55:38] that it is pretty perfect for him
[55:40] because on a daily basis we are
[55:42] bombarded with distractions in our lives
[55:46] as Sons and Daughters of God
[55:49] and the reason that he has perfected it
[55:52] in such a way is you know Satan doesn't
[55:54] care about those that do not claim
[55:57] Christianity do not claim to be Sons and
[56:00] Daughters of God but he's after you and
[56:02] I
[56:03] whenever we confess and we profess
[56:06] Christianity that we love the Lord and
[56:09] we have a testimony of God what of what
[56:11] God has done in our lives immediately
[56:14] there's a Target that's put on our back
[56:17] and that Target Satan has there because
[56:19] he wants to take us down he wants to
[56:23] take our eyes off the prize he wants to
[56:26] take our Focus off of what what we
[56:28] should be focusing on because he doesn't
[56:31] want us to live a life that is pleasing
[56:34] to God
[56:36] as I think about it even just now
[56:39] we could say yeah Satan he wants to take
[56:42] us out and he wants to take us down but
[56:44] he wants us to feel that we're not
[56:47] worthy enough that we're not good enough
[56:49] that we're not a good enough Christian
[56:51] and so what he does is he puts things in
[56:54] our lives he puts distractions in our
[56:56] lives so that our eyes are not on the
[57:00] prize and so when he gets us to a place
[57:03] of undergoing
[57:06] yeah we'll never uh we'll never disclaim
[57:10] God and we'll never say that God isn't
[57:12] real but if he can get us to a place
[57:15] where we're feel like we are undergoors
[57:18] where we feel like we're never will
[57:20] never live to our full potential that's
[57:24] exactly where he wants us to be
[57:27] I want to tell you this morning
[57:29] that you are able to go the distance
[57:33] that the potential in you is a full
[57:36] potential and God is going to bring that
[57:39] out of the seed so it doesn't matter
[57:41] about ourselves take your eyes off
[57:44] yourself and put your eyes on God keep
[57:47] your eyes on the prize
[57:51] because this bride is not going to be a
[57:55] defeated bride
[57:57] God's children are not going to be a
[58:00] defeated children but God's children are
[58:03] Overcomers God's children are going to
[58:06] make it
[58:09] you can't help it
[58:12] because you were destined to make it
[58:16] Hallelujah
[58:18] so we find out in times of War
[58:22] the most dangerous thing for a soldier
[58:24] to do is is to lose his Focus
[58:27] is to lose his vision on the mission
[58:30] that he is on at that time
[58:32] because one second of losing focus one
[58:35] moment of of forgetting the mission that
[58:38] they're on at that certain time it could
[58:40] cause death
[58:42] one moment
[58:44] a moment of not looking around a corner
[58:46] good enough a moment of not staying in
[58:50] with with with with with those who are
[58:52] fighting with you your comrades
[58:55] the people that are on your team one
[58:57] moment of of not looking out for them
[58:59] one moment of of distraction one moment
[59:02] of losing your focus
[59:05] it can be of great catastrophe
[59:09] not only for yourself but for those
[59:11] around you
[59:15] not only does it put you in trouble
[59:19] but it puts the whole Battalion in
[59:21] trouble
[59:22] understand that an army or a battalion
[59:27] is only as strong as its weakest link
[59:30] that's why when you watch these uh you
[59:33] ever see it online there uh of hell week
[59:36] and the things that that these men go
[59:38] through in order to be a a a a special
[59:41] marine or a Green Beret or whatever the
[59:44] title might be and they're always
[59:46] telling them just quit
[59:47] just quit just go ahead and quit you're
[59:50] not made for this this is too hard for
[59:53] you you want to quit don't you isn't
[59:54] that what Satan wants to try to do to us
[59:56] on a daily basis yeah you might as well
[59:58] just quit it's too hard the journey is
[1:00:00] too rough there's too many trials
[1:00:02] there's too many Temptations this one
[1:00:04] has fallen away so you might as fall
[1:00:06] away as well
[1:00:07] go ahead and ring the bell
[1:00:11] ring it
[1:00:12] it's got your name written all over it
[1:00:15] well these these men they are so
[1:00:18] deprived of sleep they're so deprived of
[1:00:21] of food and shelter and everything is
[1:00:24] stripped away from them until they
[1:00:25] finally think you know what I made it I
[1:00:28] made a mistake this is not for me
[1:00:33] I might as well just ring the bell
[1:00:36] but the purpose of it is this
[1:00:40] is that they don't they want to push
[1:00:42] these guys to their limits
[1:00:45] they want people that will not quit
[1:00:49] because if they quit there they'll quit
[1:00:52] on the battlefield
[1:00:54] God is not raising quitters in this end
[1:00:57] time
[1:00:58] but he is raising people who are not
[1:01:01] going to ring that Bell who are going to
[1:01:04] continue and press on in the fight
[1:01:09] when I was younger I used to do
[1:01:11] kickboxing and so my uncle was uh
[1:01:15] Australian Commonwealth champion and and
[1:01:17] different things he was pretty good and
[1:01:20] so when I was eight nine years old I
[1:01:23] wanted to be a kickboxer and I wanted to
[1:01:25] fight and um so I remember he took me
[1:01:28] down to Belfast and and I was always
[1:01:32] sparring with people that was older than
[1:01:34] me they were there I was in an adult
[1:01:36] class but he let me in the class because
[1:01:38] I was family sometimes family get uh
[1:01:42] little things like that that other
[1:01:44] people don't get so anyways he wanted to
[1:01:46] see what was in me so it takes me down
[1:01:49] to Belfast Billy Murray's gym and
[1:01:51] there's all these young people are and
[1:01:53] and I didn't realize it but they're all
[1:01:55] waiting for me
[1:01:57] and I'm thinking well this is fantastic
[1:02:00] and so you're nervous and all these
[1:02:02] different things anyways we get in we
[1:02:04] get into the ring and we begin to spar
[1:02:06] well these guys were way better than
[1:02:08] what I was man they could kick and do
[1:02:10] all these different things and and and
[1:02:12] and and and and all I knew all I had
[1:02:15] what was good was a good low kick
[1:02:17] that could look kick very good because
[1:02:19] I'm short
[1:02:21] well it turns out in kickboxing there's
[1:02:23] different rules
[1:02:24] so when the rules set no low kicks well
[1:02:28] great so these guys are coming out and
[1:02:30] they're kicking me and everything well I
[1:02:33] saw my chance and I just cracked this
[1:02:35] guy right on the chin as hard as I could
[1:02:39] and so it made me feel really good but
[1:02:41] after that he he hit me back really good
[1:02:43] and he kicked me and I ended up on the
[1:02:45] ground
[1:02:46] well truth be told I lost my balance
[1:02:50] but my uncle Danver he always told me he
[1:02:53] said it doesn't matter if you get your
[1:02:55] bail rung it doesn't matter if you
[1:02:57] slipped he would always tell me take an
[1:02:59] eight count
[1:03:00] take an eight count and get your breath
[1:03:02] back get your composure back get
[1:03:04] yourself back in the zone
[1:03:07] so whether I was hurt or not guess what
[1:03:09] I did I took an eight count I was fine
[1:03:11] what was I doing I was I was taking uh
[1:03:14] taking everything in I was getting my
[1:03:16] composure back I was getting my mind
[1:03:18] back in the right place why because I
[1:03:21] was on the ground one thing about a
[1:03:23] Christian he doesn't stay on the ground
[1:03:26] even though he gets hit down and he gets
[1:03:28] his bell wrong he gets back up again
[1:03:31] and so I get back up I have my composure
[1:03:34] and he comes at me again well I hit him
[1:03:36] with this really sweet straight right
[1:03:39] hand and so after that you know his
[1:03:41] because they play favoritism down there
[1:03:44] as well uh because he was hurt well they
[1:03:46] took him out and they put somebody else
[1:03:48] in so now I'm sparring against somebody
[1:03:50] else but I look over to the side and I
[1:03:52] see this guy and he's shaking his head
[1:03:54] and I thought my goodness if I wouldn't
[1:03:57] have taken the eight count understand it
[1:04:01] might have went a little bit different
[1:04:02] and so it is with the Christian Life
[1:04:06] the strength that you gain while you're
[1:04:09] on your knees
[1:04:10] is what's gonna take you further in your
[1:04:13] Christian walk so let me encourage some
[1:04:16] of you this morning take an eight count
[1:04:19] don't get up in one or two seconds if
[1:04:21] you got your bell wrong don't get up in
[1:04:24] one or two seconds if you have slipped
[1:04:25] and you've Fallen but spend time upon
[1:04:28] your knees spend time in prayer take
[1:04:30] that eight count because eight is the
[1:04:32] number of Eternity
[1:04:34] that's where we'll gain our strength is
[1:04:36] from the eternal spirit God
[1:04:39] so don't be in a rush to get back up
[1:04:42] don't be in a rush to try and get back
[1:04:44] in the game but spend your time in
[1:04:46] prayer and God will renew your strength
[1:04:53] too much of the time people try to get
[1:04:55] up too quickly well I'm okay I'm okay no
[1:04:57] you're not okay
[1:04:59] take the count
[1:05:02] ask for help
[1:05:05] reach out to your pastor reach out to
[1:05:08] your parents
[1:05:10] you know what's uh you know what one
[1:05:13] thing is a fact about young people
[1:05:15] you're gonna fall
[1:05:18] you know it's a fact about older people
[1:05:20] they're gonna fall
[1:05:22] you know it's a fact about Humanity we
[1:05:25] are going to fall
[1:05:27] and when we fall we have no reason to be
[1:05:30] embarrassed about it
[1:05:32] if we need help reach out and ask for
[1:05:34] help no matter what age we are we often
[1:05:38] think about the young people well it's
[1:05:40] only young people that make mistakes
[1:05:43] can some of the elders Say Amen
[1:05:48] give some of the younger encouragement
[1:05:53] don't be scared to Humble yourselves
[1:05:56] and to reach out for help when you're in
[1:05:59] a time of trouble amen
[1:06:03] foreign
[1:06:05] we find that there's many distractions
[1:06:07] on the battlefield
[1:06:09] there's Rockets blasting there's people
[1:06:12] getting injured
[1:06:13] there's those who are close to you who
[1:06:15] are falling left and right
[1:06:18] but no matter what happens upon the
[1:06:20] battlefield no matter what distractions
[1:06:23] there is out on this battlefield each
[1:06:26] individual has to make sure that they
[1:06:29] keep their focus
[1:06:31] I didn't even think about tomorrow being
[1:06:34] Memorial Day
[1:06:36] we've had many soldiers that are amongst
[1:06:39] us that have fought for our country
[1:06:42] but you know what we have soldiers that
[1:06:44] are amongst us who are fighting for the
[1:06:46] bride who are fighting for one another
[1:06:55] a lot of times I'm sure you've seen it
[1:06:57] where
[1:06:58] there will be man and young boys
[1:07:00] especially they'll get shell shocked
[1:07:04] and something will happen there will be
[1:07:06] an explosion there'll be something
[1:07:08] catastrophic that'll cause them to
[1:07:10] completely lose their focus and lose
[1:07:12] where they're at at the very present
[1:07:15] time where they are
[1:07:16] and you'll see that the commander the
[1:07:19] captain who's in charge he'll go and
[1:07:21] he'll grab him and he'll say stay
[1:07:23] focused
[1:07:25] stay in line
[1:07:27] keep your mind in the game
[1:07:29] I know there's many distractions amongst
[1:07:32] us I know there's many falling I know
[1:07:35] it's not easy but there's a mission at
[1:07:37] hand
[1:07:39] we have sent we have been sent here with
[1:07:42] a purpose we've been sent here on a
[1:07:44] mission and our mission is to fulfill
[1:07:46] the purpose that we've been sent here
[1:07:48] for now stay focused
[1:07:51] I feel like some of us need a good Shake
[1:07:54] in this end time Felix in you gotta stay
[1:07:57] focused man you gotta stay in the game
[1:07:59] you got to stay in the word
[1:08:04] this is not a time to get unfocused
[1:08:08] this is not a time to be looking at
[1:08:10] worldly things and pleasures and
[1:08:13] materialistic items that we may want in
[1:08:16] our lives but now is the time for us to
[1:08:18] stay focused in the word now is the time
[1:08:21] for us to stay focused on the mission
[1:08:23] that we've been sent here for
[1:08:27] you know what the mission is for the
[1:08:29] bride right now is to take a rapture
[1:08:33] she's the final voice to the final age
[1:08:36] but her purpose
[1:08:38] is to find the last one in order to take
[1:08:42] a Rapture don't be taking your eyes off
[1:08:44] the goal
[1:08:46] don't be taking your eyes off the gold
[1:08:49] just because it hasn't happened yet
[1:08:52] well brother Stephen they've been
[1:08:53] preaching on the Rapture for years and
[1:08:55] until it happens we'll keep preaching it
[1:08:59] I'm here to remind you of the goal
[1:09:02] because when we have a gold set in our
[1:09:04] mind guess what we have something to
[1:09:06] focus for
[1:09:09] you but I feel too much of us are
[1:09:11] getting distracted
[1:09:13] we're getting distracted by life we're
[1:09:15] getting distracted by Family we're
[1:09:17] getting distracted by all the chaos
[1:09:20] that's going on in the world right now
[1:09:24] the things that have happened since
[1:09:26] covet hit
[1:09:27] you ever hear that well since covid
[1:09:31] I can't remember how many years ago it
[1:09:33] was well coven oh yeah it was three
[1:09:35] years ago that happened everything is
[1:09:38] since covet had and we find that since
[1:09:40] covet hit my goodness it seems like
[1:09:42] things are just getting worse and worse
[1:09:45] and worse
[1:09:46] but that's just normal that's just
[1:09:49] natural because it's been prophesied in
[1:09:52] this time that things will get worse and
[1:09:54] worse that man will be heady they'll be
[1:09:57] high-minded they'll be lovers of
[1:09:59] themselves more than lovers of God
[1:10:01] they'll be lovers of materialistic
[1:10:03] things more than lovers of God they'll
[1:10:05] be lovers of the world more than lovers
[1:10:07] of God
[1:10:09] so don't be surprised when it gets worse
[1:10:12] don't be surprised when our school
[1:10:14] systems get worse don't be surprised
[1:10:17] when Society gets worse don't be
[1:10:20] surprised when the Rapture happens
[1:10:23] don't be surprised but be ready for it
[1:10:30] many distractions stay focused
[1:10:34] stay focused
[1:10:38] stay focused on the prize
[1:10:40] stay focused on the mission
[1:10:43] stay focused on your purpose that you
[1:10:45] have in Christ Jesus stay focused stay
[1:10:49] focused on your position in the body of
[1:10:52] Christ
[1:11:01] as Sons and Daughters of God we are
[1:11:03] called to a battle
[1:11:06] it's an automatic draft
[1:11:10] this isn't something that you're asked
[1:11:13] to do but this is something that
[1:11:16] automatically happens when you have a
[1:11:18] born-again experience with Jesus Christ
[1:11:20] guess what automatic draft into the army
[1:11:24] of God
[1:11:25] it has no age limit
[1:11:28] it doesn't have no specific gender it's
[1:11:31] for boys it's for girls it's for men and
[1:11:34] it's for women of all ages who's had an
[1:11:37] experience with God Almighty guess what
[1:11:39] you were called to a battle
[1:11:44] every day we're faced with a battle
[1:11:48] every day we are in the midst of the
[1:11:51] greatest battle that's ever fought
[1:11:52] therefore Sons and Daughters of God are
[1:11:55] on the Forefront of the battle each and
[1:11:58] every day
[1:12:06] it is not an Earthly battle that is
[1:12:08] fought
[1:12:10] with guns and fists and kicks and all
[1:12:13] those different things but it is a
[1:12:15] spiritual battle it is the Battle of the
[1:12:18] Mind Ephesians 6 verse 12 it says for we
[1:12:21] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:12:24] against principalities notice where your
[1:12:27] battle is against and is not against
[1:12:30] your brother or your sister in the Lord
[1:12:33] young people your battle is not against
[1:12:35] your parents
[1:12:37] your battle is not against mom and dad
[1:12:40] your battle is not against the people
[1:12:42] sitting beside you but your battle is
[1:12:44] against principalities it's against
[1:12:47] Powers it's against the rulers of
[1:12:48] Darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:12:51] wickedness and high places
[1:12:54] the battle that we are in is a spiritual
[1:12:57] battle
[1:12:58] it's a battle that's fought within the
[1:13:01] human body within the mind it is a
[1:13:03] spiritual battle because we Are
[1:13:05] Spiritual Beings that are trapped within
[1:13:08] a natural body
[1:13:11] we are not carnal people with uh
[1:13:13] something spiritual we're not a natural
[1:13:15] people with something spiritual within
[1:13:18] us but we are first Spiritual Beings
[1:13:20] because that's what we were since the
[1:13:23] beginning this is second place this is
[1:13:27] carnal but who we really are is a
[1:13:29] spiritual being in Christ Jesus
[1:13:32] so therefore the battle is spiritual
[1:13:40] Hallelujah
[1:13:45] as we look we find that there's many
[1:13:47] battlegrounds
[1:13:49] where
[1:13:51] Armies come against each other you can
[1:13:53] even look in Ukraine right now and you
[1:13:55] see the the battle for uh back Moon Back
[1:13:59] Moon and kive and all these different
[1:14:01] places there's all these different
[1:14:02] battlefronts
[1:14:04] that are along this Ukraine border and
[1:14:07] and within the the city it's the country
[1:14:09] itself there but we find that
[1:14:13] within our own lives there's many
[1:14:15] battlegrounds
[1:14:16] sure we realize that the greatest battle
[1:14:19] that we fight is is within our minds and
[1:14:21] and just let me encourage you this
[1:14:24] morning that you need to stop listening
[1:14:26] to your mind into your own thoughts
[1:14:30] but you need to spend time and prayer to
[1:14:32] sensitize your spirit to that still
[1:14:35] Small Voice because it's still Small
[1:14:37] Voice it does not speak to your mind the
[1:14:40] still Small Voice speaks to the heart
[1:14:42] because God chose the heart for the
[1:14:45] dwelling for his dwelling place and
[1:14:47] Satan chose the mind but what happens
[1:14:50] too much of the time is we're thinking
[1:14:52] too much with our carnal mind and
[1:14:54] everything that comes into our minds we
[1:14:56] believe it
[1:14:58] but rather if you would pay attention to
[1:15:01] this still small voice and the
[1:15:03] leadership of God that dwells within the
[1:15:06] heart of a born-again Believer it would
[1:15:08] be far better for us
[1:15:11] there would be less carnality in our
[1:15:14] lives
[1:15:15] there would be less fighting in our
[1:15:17] lives and bickering one with another why
[1:15:19] because we are being led of the spirit
[1:15:25] you know God speaks to you on a daily
[1:15:27] basis
[1:15:30] a lot of times we think to ourselves my
[1:15:33] if I could just have been in the time of
[1:15:35] the disciples if I could have just been
[1:15:37] a prophet and that God would speak to me
[1:15:40] like he did Abraham if God would speak
[1:15:42] to me like he did with Moses if God
[1:15:44] would speak to me like he did with
[1:15:46] Elijah I've got news for you he does
[1:15:50] our problems exist that we're distracted
[1:15:53] by this uh by this place that we call
[1:15:57] Earth and everything that's designed to
[1:16:00] distract us we we get caught up with
[1:16:02] those things rather than the things of
[1:16:04] God
[1:16:06] what happens when we get caught up with
[1:16:08] everything around us is our spirit gets
[1:16:10] hardened
[1:16:12] have you ever had a hardened spirit
[1:16:13] before
[1:16:15] have you ever had an attitude where well
[1:16:17] I just don't really care anymore yeah
[1:16:20] because your spirit is hardened
[1:16:23] so how does a person's Spirit get
[1:16:25] hardened within them they're not
[1:16:27] yielding to the things of God they're
[1:16:29] not sensitizing their Spirits by prayer
[1:16:32] and reading
[1:16:36] so if you ever come across somebody and
[1:16:38] it seems well yeah today they're a
[1:16:40] little more carnal than they were
[1:16:42] yesterday
[1:16:43] and if it goes on for a week or a month
[1:16:45] you know that there's something wrong
[1:16:47] within that person's heart you know that
[1:16:50] their Spirit has been hardened by
[1:16:52] something
[1:16:53] because number one they're not spending
[1:16:55] the time that they should in prayer with
[1:16:57] God because brother Branham said that
[1:16:59] prayer sensitizes your spirit
[1:17:05] so if you're hardened this morning
[1:17:08] let me encourage you spend a little time
[1:17:10] on your knees
[1:17:12] spend a little time with God
[1:17:15] sensitize your spirit because God will
[1:17:18] speak
[1:17:20] there will be little red flashing lights
[1:17:23] that are warning us not to go down this
[1:17:25] Avenue don't go down there don't do that
[1:17:27] don't say that
[1:17:29] but there will be also times where he'll
[1:17:31] speak to our hearts and he'll say go
[1:17:34] down this Avenue
[1:17:36] go there
[1:17:38] talk to that person do this or do that
[1:17:41] but if our Spirits is hardened
[1:17:44] if our hearts is full of callous guess
[1:17:46] what there's no way for us to hear the
[1:17:50] mind of God there's no way for us to
[1:17:53] hear his voice
[1:17:54] you know what happened to brother brown
[1:17:56] one time
[1:17:57] he got so hard and calloused he said a
[1:18:00] bunch of rickies and bunts of rickettis
[1:18:03] I tell him I tell the women not to cut
[1:18:06] their hair and I and I come back and and
[1:18:08] it's worse than it was before
[1:18:10] you know brother Branham had a backbone
[1:18:14] when I was in Ireland I went to uh I
[1:18:16] went to a Pentecostal church with my
[1:18:18] parents
[1:18:20] and
[1:18:22] there's zero holiness
[1:18:25] there's zero all the women have cut
[1:18:28] short hair
[1:18:30] burn pants all on and on just I could
[1:18:32] just say there's no Holiness and you'll
[1:18:34] understand what I'm trying to say
[1:18:37] and I got to thinking about brother
[1:18:38] Branham
[1:18:39] and I thought brother Branham who did he
[1:18:41] go to
[1:18:43] Pentecostals
[1:18:45] brother Branham was ministering the
[1:18:47] gospel now he would say and you women
[1:18:50] I'll look at a man you women right
[1:18:56] he should be ashamed of yourself and we
[1:18:59] all laugh
[1:19:00] that's kind of funny but imagine
[1:19:03] here he is by himself in another man's
[1:19:05] pulpit
[1:19:06] preaching to other people sometimes from
[1:19:08] 30 to 500 a thousand whatever and he's
[1:19:11] making eye contact with people
[1:19:13] should be and you men letting your women
[1:19:16] go out like that
[1:19:18] should be ashamed of yourselves
[1:19:21] he was talking to people
[1:19:24] brother Brown didn't pull no punches
[1:19:27] he was a man with absolute backbone for
[1:19:30] us it's easy now women don't cut your
[1:19:32] hair yet we all know
[1:19:35] it's easy to remind once in a while
[1:19:38] but I just thought my goodness this man
[1:19:40] was such a man of God
[1:19:44] that no matter if it was hard or not
[1:19:47] he still preached the word and he
[1:19:50] preached the truth whether anybody
[1:19:52] agreed with him or not
[1:19:56] for man
[1:19:57] so next time that you that you hear that
[1:20:00] just think of the people who he's
[1:20:02] preaching to
[1:20:03] it gives us that little bit more of
[1:20:05] respect for brother Branham but we find
[1:20:08] out that one of the battlefronts that's
[1:20:10] within our lives as Believers in this
[1:20:14] day is the Battlefront of the family
[1:20:17] we find out that Satan is doing
[1:20:19] everything that he can to uh to divide
[1:20:24] and to conquer the family unit
[1:20:30] and he does it through our own carnal
[1:20:32] selves
[1:20:34] he does it through the disobedient
[1:20:36] children he he does it through all these
[1:20:39] different Avenues whatever it may be but
[1:20:42] whatever what he wants to do in his main
[1:20:44] goal is to divide and to conquer our
[1:20:48] family lives and our family units
[1:20:53] Now understand this that it's not the
[1:20:56] pastor's uh
[1:20:58] job
[1:21:00] to keep the family unit in line in our
[1:21:03] own houses
[1:21:06] as the pastor's job to keep the family
[1:21:09] unit within the church body
[1:21:11] you understand that but when we go home
[1:21:15] that responsibility goes off onto
[1:21:17] somebody else
[1:21:18] it goes off onto the heads of the homes
[1:21:22] and so we find out now that Satan is
[1:21:24] trying to attack the heads of the houses
[1:21:27] he's trying to attack our families
[1:21:29] because he understands this concept that
[1:21:33] the church body is only as strong as our
[1:21:37] families are strong
[1:21:39] if we got weak families at home
[1:21:42] if the heads of the home are weak in
[1:21:45] mind if they're weak and standard if
[1:21:48] they don't have a backbone guess what
[1:21:49] the family is not going to have a
[1:21:52] backbone the family is not going to have
[1:21:54] any kind of standard the wife won't be
[1:21:57] in her place he won't be in her place
[1:21:59] and neither will the children
[1:22:02] and so we find that whenever our family
[1:22:05] life and the family unit is
[1:22:09] um what's the word I'm looking for
[1:22:11] not comprised but compromised
[1:22:16] when the family unit is compromised it
[1:22:20] compromises the church body because
[1:22:22] we're we're like a battalion we're only
[1:22:25] as strong as our weakest link
[1:22:29] I wonder how life is with you at home
[1:22:33] I wonder how life is with you and your
[1:22:36] family at this very present time when
[1:22:38] you go home
[1:22:40] I had a dream the other the other week
[1:22:42] and uh
[1:22:44] and in my dream I was ministering
[1:22:47] and I was ministering from a chair it
[1:22:50] wasn't in this church but and I was I
[1:22:53] was I had a seat belt on
[1:22:55] and it seemed like I was trying my best
[1:22:58] to minister and I couldn't and I was
[1:23:00] trying to get up and I and and I just
[1:23:03] couldn't Minister like I know how I
[1:23:04] should be able to
[1:23:06] well all of a sudden they took the seat
[1:23:08] belt off and I was able to minister like
[1:23:12] I should and what I began to preach on
[1:23:14] was the family life
[1:23:18] I began to pray I remember it just like
[1:23:21] it just happened in real life and I
[1:23:23] began to say how is your family life at
[1:23:26] home
[1:23:28] how are things behind closed doors
[1:23:32] we can come to church and we can put our
[1:23:35] Halos on and we know the right things to
[1:23:37] say
[1:23:38] we know the right things to wear we know
[1:23:40] how to greet people we know how to be
[1:23:42] respectful but how is the standard in
[1:23:45] your home
[1:23:47] how is your family life at your home at
[1:23:51] this present time
[1:23:55] I begin to think
[1:23:57] I think that's an inspired thought
[1:24:01] because what is happening behind closed
[1:24:04] doors it only takes a matter of time
[1:24:06] before it becomes manifested
[1:24:09] and if things are not correct behind
[1:24:12] closed doors how can we expect things to
[1:24:15] be correct amongst us how can we expect
[1:24:17] God to freely move in our church
[1:24:19] services
[1:24:26] so let me speak to your hearts to see
[1:24:28] this morning
[1:24:30] how was your life at home
[1:24:32] dad husband
[1:24:37] are you raising your family are you
[1:24:39] controlling your household according to
[1:24:40] the word of God
[1:24:42] are you holding a standard debt hey yeah
[1:24:45] the world might do this and the world
[1:24:47] might act like this but as for me and my
[1:24:49] house this is how we're going to serve
[1:24:51] the Lord I don't care if you want to do
[1:24:54] this or not hey these are my standards
[1:24:59] so much of the time we preach at the
[1:25:01] women
[1:25:03] and we forget about the heads of the
[1:25:05] homes
[1:25:09] we forget about the husbands
[1:25:12] who aren't being diligent in their walk
[1:25:14] with God
[1:25:15] we forget about the husbands that have
[1:25:17] forgotten their first love with their
[1:25:19] wives
[1:25:20] we forget about the husbands who beat
[1:25:22] their kids instead of correcting them
[1:25:25] with a spanking there's a difference
[1:25:28] we forget about the husbands who aren't
[1:25:30] holding any kind of standard in their
[1:25:32] lives
[1:25:34] they're doing what they want because
[1:25:36] they say they're the head of the home
[1:25:37] Christ is the head of the man
[1:25:40] Christ is the head of our homes
[1:25:46] we forget
[1:25:48] dads and husbands
[1:25:50] where's the standard
[1:25:55] are you raising your family will you say
[1:25:57] brother Stephen you're too late in the
[1:26:00] game I already raised my family well it
[1:26:02] doesn't matter
[1:26:03] it doesn't give you an excuse to lose
[1:26:06] focus on the prize because chances are
[1:26:09] you're going to have grandkids
[1:26:12] and they're going to need trained up
[1:26:14] also
[1:26:17] let the Holy Spirit deal with your heart
[1:26:21] how's your home life
[1:26:23] how's your prayer life
[1:26:25] how's the family alter with your family
[1:26:31] I think we've left off the family all
[1:26:33] the family Altar for YouTube
[1:26:38] we've left off the family Altar for
[1:26:41] watching things online
[1:26:43] that do nothing but waste time
[1:26:45] we've left off the family Altar for CNN
[1:26:49] we've left off the family Altar for Fox
[1:26:51] News
[1:26:55] what happens when you leave off the
[1:26:57] family altar with our family
[1:26:59] there's one let me ask you a question
[1:27:02] what brought you and your wife together
[1:27:04] as a unit
[1:27:05] it was Christ
[1:27:07] if it wasn't for God I never would have
[1:27:09] met my wife
[1:27:10] so God is the magnet that brought us
[1:27:13] together
[1:27:15] he is the one that tied us together he
[1:27:18] is the one that brought us together as a
[1:27:20] unit But as time goes on how quick and
[1:27:23] how easy it is to leave off of
[1:27:26] the one who brought us together
[1:27:31] because now it's about you and your
[1:27:34] family
[1:27:35] now it's about you and your wife know
[1:27:36] it's about you and Christ and the rest
[1:27:38] follows
[1:27:42] I like that scripture in Samuel that we
[1:27:45] just read
[1:27:46] and Samuel said yeah you've done all
[1:27:48] these things you've went you've looked
[1:27:51] to the left you've done what was wrong
[1:27:53] but
[1:27:54] you don't have to stay in that condition
[1:27:57] but there's a time to repent there's a
[1:28:00] time to make things right and there's no
[1:28:02] greater time than the very present
[1:28:08] dads husbands
[1:28:10] stay focused
[1:28:13] stay in the game
[1:28:15] if you've left off of your first love of
[1:28:18] God and the unity of God within the home
[1:28:20] guess what there's no better time than
[1:28:22] the present which is right now to say
[1:28:24] God I've been wrong God of my focus has
[1:28:28] been on things that I shouldn't be
[1:28:30] focusing on but from this time Lord I'm
[1:28:33] going to rededicate my life back to you
[1:28:36] because I want you to be the center of
[1:28:38] my home
[1:28:41] brother brother Ron said on Friday at
[1:28:44] the wedding a couple who prayed together
[1:28:47] Stay Together
[1:28:48] leave off of prayer it's I was thinking
[1:28:51] about it it's kind of funny you know you
[1:28:54] get them up here and they're so in love
[1:28:55] and they're holding hands and oh yes
[1:28:57] I'll always keep her my sweetheart oh
[1:28:59] yes keep her your sweetheart he's he I
[1:29:02] think that you know the thing about
[1:29:04] weddings is for me as a husband and is
[1:29:06] like yep puts me in remembrance oh I'll
[1:29:09] always keep her my sweetheart well Ten
[1:29:11] Years Later plus you forget hey she's
[1:29:14] still your sweetheart
[1:29:17] your job is not your sweetheart
[1:29:20] the people at work is not your
[1:29:22] sweetheart
[1:29:23] your sweetheart is your sweetheart
[1:29:25] and you said you would keep her as your
[1:29:27] sweetheart
[1:29:28] so keep her as your sweetheart
[1:29:33] yeah time goes on focus is change father
[1:29:37] bring us back lord into Focus
[1:29:41] amen
[1:29:43] amen
[1:29:48] we're living in a time where
[1:29:51] the teachings of the family unit and
[1:29:53] God's expectations of each role within
[1:29:55] that unit
[1:29:57] our
[1:29:59] we don't hear it enough
[1:30:04] we know what is right but I feel like we
[1:30:07] need to be kept in remembrance once in a
[1:30:10] while of the roles of the husband and
[1:30:12] the roles of the wife within the family
[1:30:14] unit not according to what they say out
[1:30:17] there
[1:30:18] but according to what the word of God
[1:30:21] says
[1:30:25] we find that uh
[1:30:28] many people feel that
[1:30:31] this is an old-fashioned way of raising
[1:30:34] a family
[1:30:36] it is an old-fashioned way of of of of
[1:30:40] of how you should treat one another but
[1:30:43] God's word is not old
[1:30:47] because it is eternal
[1:30:49] it is not old-fashioned it is not in
[1:30:53] fashion and it is not out of fashion but
[1:30:55] it is the way
[1:30:57] the truth and the life
[1:31:00] and So within the word of God now he
[1:31:03] lays out certain roles in certain ways
[1:31:05] for us as Sons and Daughters to raise
[1:31:08] our families can you say Amen
[1:31:11] okay
[1:31:12] Genesis 3 16 it says on to the woman he
[1:31:16] said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[1:31:19] and thy conception and sorrow Thou shalt
[1:31:23] bring forth children and thy desire
[1:31:25] shall be to thy husband and he shall
[1:31:28] rule over thee so we realize that
[1:31:32] everything to do with childbearing and
[1:31:35] everything has to do with the woman
[1:31:38] believe it or not
[1:31:40] we're living in a time where they're
[1:31:42] trying to switch it
[1:31:44] I watched the little thing the other day
[1:31:45] uh that guy Matt
[1:31:48] um whatever his name is the who is a
[1:31:50] woman guy
[1:31:52] and um or what is a woman he did that
[1:31:54] documentary and so he's having an open
[1:31:57] air because he's all of a sudden he's he
[1:31:59] wants to be a politician or whatever and
[1:32:01] um they're asking him questions so
[1:32:04] there's a transgender woman which is a
[1:32:07] man that's asking him a question and and
[1:32:11] so he so this person is unfolding their
[1:32:15] life before him and it turns out that
[1:32:18] this person is an EMT so a lot of times
[1:32:21] they want to ask all the questions but
[1:32:24] they don't want to be asked questions
[1:32:27] and so he said I'll answer your question
[1:32:30] as long as you let me ask you a question
[1:32:32] at the end of this question and so
[1:32:36] anyways he answers her question she
[1:32:38] doesn't like the answer and walks off
[1:32:41] and so he goes no no no no no no no come
[1:32:44] back here I have a question for you he
[1:32:46] said you said that you are an EMT that's
[1:32:49] right he said now let me ask you a
[1:32:51] question you have a person that's laying
[1:32:54] in front of you and you know it's a male
[1:32:58] and they're telling you that they have
[1:33:00] severe abdominal pain but they tell you
[1:33:03] that you're that they are pregnant are
[1:33:06] you going to do a scan to see if they're
[1:33:08] pregnant or not
[1:33:09] she said no he said why
[1:33:14] she said because it's a man
[1:33:19] just totally debunked their own question
[1:33:22] he says wait a second I thought wouldn't
[1:33:25] you have to check it and wouldn't you
[1:33:26] have to be politically correct to say if
[1:33:29] they say they're a woman and they say
[1:33:31] that this is happening that you have to
[1:33:32] agree with it
[1:33:33] just walked off the stage
[1:33:36] does not make any kind of sense
[1:33:38] whatsoever
[1:33:40] God help us huh to raise our children
[1:33:44] to know what's right and what's wrong to
[1:33:47] know what a boy is and to know what a
[1:33:49] girl is no matter what anybody in the
[1:33:51] school tries to tell them
[1:33:54] amen Ephesians 5 22 verse 24 wives
[1:33:58] submit yourselves onto your own husbands
[1:34:01] as unto the Lord
[1:34:04] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:34:06] even as Christ is the head of the church
[1:34:09] and he is the savior of the body
[1:34:12] therefore as the church is subject onto
[1:34:15] Christ let the wives be to their own
[1:34:18] husbands
[1:34:19] in everything
[1:34:22] so the scripture is is laying out a
[1:34:25] pattern for us to live our lives and
[1:34:28] he's saying wives guess what
[1:34:30] submit yourselves to your husbands
[1:34:33] because he has rule overeating
[1:34:37] because Adam was formed first and not
[1:34:40] Eve the Bible says that Eve was the one
[1:34:42] that fell in the transgression it wasn't
[1:34:46] the man he said because thou has done
[1:34:48] this Eve
[1:34:50] every single woman from now until the
[1:34:52] end of time guess what their husbands is
[1:34:55] going to have rule over them
[1:35:00] now does that mean for a husband that he
[1:35:02] should get out here and
[1:35:03] rule with an iron rod and with a fist of
[1:35:08] no real man wouldn't act like that
[1:35:12] a real man will love his wife
[1:35:14] has Christ loved the church
[1:35:19] but for our sisters let me encourage you
[1:35:23] because we are living in a time where
[1:35:27] I don't want to say women's rights and
[1:35:30] Liberty and all that stuff we're we're
[1:35:32] living in a time where it's more pushed
[1:35:34] for a woman to be elevated above the man
[1:35:37] and a lot of times the woman is smarter
[1:35:42] than most of the men
[1:35:44] and speak by experience
[1:35:49] [Laughter]
[1:35:53] but because I have a wife who loves the
[1:35:56] Lord
[1:35:58] and wants to be obedient to the word of
[1:36:00] God what did she do even when she's
[1:36:03] smarter and she might be right
[1:36:06] she brings herself subject
[1:36:09] to the headship of her husband which is
[1:36:11] myself
[1:36:14] you know a lot of times
[1:36:16] if you approach your husband the correct
[1:36:19] way
[1:36:19] he'll take it correctly
[1:36:24] she'd say honey
[1:36:26] you missed out about this no honey it's
[1:36:29] not that and she'll explain it three
[1:36:31] different ways until finally ding
[1:36:36] I was right and then I'll tell her what
[1:36:38] it is huh
[1:36:39] and then she'd go that's what I've been
[1:36:40] telling him the whole time
[1:36:45] but what happens is we're living in such
[1:36:47] a society now where
[1:36:50] the woman is elevated above the man in
[1:36:53] the world
[1:36:55] and now she begins to take on that
[1:36:57] Spirit of well let me tell you
[1:37:00] and let me tell you something well
[1:37:02] you're just absolutely wrong
[1:37:05] no your approach is wrong
[1:37:08] so God help us help our wives
[1:37:12] to be subject to their own husbands
[1:37:16] you don't got to be subject to everybody
[1:37:17] else's husband
[1:37:21] husband
[1:37:23] and say Lord
[1:37:25] what does the Bible say of a quiet and
[1:37:28] meek spirit
[1:37:30] it's of great price and the eyes of God
[1:37:32] it's not always about being right or
[1:37:35] being wrong
[1:37:36] but it's having the right Spirit and the
[1:37:39] right attitude
[1:37:41] don't let the world infiltrate your home
[1:37:44] life
[1:37:45] don't let the women out there come into
[1:37:48] your lives and let them
[1:37:50] inspire you
[1:37:53] no let the word of God inspire you
[1:37:58] amen
[1:38:00] first Peter 3 verses one through six
[1:38:04] likewise ye wives be in subjection to
[1:38:07] your own husbands that if any obey not
[1:38:10] the word they also May without the word
[1:38:13] be won by the conversation of the wives
[1:38:15] notice notice how important it is for a
[1:38:19] life for a testimony in a life of a
[1:38:23] sister what will it do it'll win the
[1:38:25] unbelieving husbands
[1:38:27] because the husband will see hey guess
[1:38:30] what there's something different about
[1:38:31] this one
[1:38:33] do you remember the story
[1:38:35] of brother Branham he would say he told
[1:38:37] the story about the man was at the bar
[1:38:41] and they were sitting there and
[1:38:42] everything and they're talking about
[1:38:43] Christianity and everything the guy says
[1:38:45] I have a wife I know a real Christian oh
[1:38:49] they're they're all Hypocrites this and
[1:38:50] that he said come to my house
[1:38:53] so these guys are obviously drunk and
[1:38:55] they go to the house and and he starts
[1:38:57] treating this woman like she's a dog
[1:39:00] woman give us something deed bring us
[1:39:02] all these different things and he's
[1:39:04] doing it on purpose to prove a point and
[1:39:06] so we find out she fixes them something
[1:39:08] to eat and brings it over and all of a
[1:39:10] sudden he gets it and he throws it off
[1:39:12] the floor and he says this isn't how I
[1:39:14] like it give me something different
[1:39:16] so it happens a couple of times and
[1:39:18] because she had the right attitude
[1:39:20] because she had the right spirit because
[1:39:23] she had it was because she had a
[1:39:25] relationship with God that's what makes
[1:39:28] the difference her spirit was soft her
[1:39:30] heart was tender and she just kept
[1:39:32] singing a little song to the Lord I
[1:39:35] forget what song it was but she kept
[1:39:37] saying then all of a sudden the Lord
[1:39:38] moved on these men's Lives why was it it
[1:39:42] was because of the testimony of the wife
[1:39:50] preach a sermon and use words if you
[1:39:52] have to
[1:39:56] Hallelujah I remember the first time
[1:39:59] that uh so Rocco's wife Jenny was was
[1:40:05] the first person uh
[1:40:07] uh the first mother in Christ I guess I
[1:40:09] could say that was ever an example for
[1:40:11] me and uh I just remember her when we
[1:40:15] would ride in the car
[1:40:17] she would let me sit up front
[1:40:20] and this was just wild to me
[1:40:23] I thought no you said and I'm trying to
[1:40:25] show her respect no you sit in the back
[1:40:27] I'll sit in the front it's okay and no
[1:40:29] no no no no no you sit in the back and I
[1:40:32] are you sit in the front and I'll sit in
[1:40:35] the back
[1:40:36] and I realize now that she was bringing
[1:40:40] herself lower because she was having
[1:40:43] respect to me as a Young Man
[1:40:47] rather than respecting herself and
[1:40:49] sitting up front with her husband in the
[1:40:51] car something simple but it was
[1:40:53] something that I noticed
[1:40:56] I would always notice that she would go
[1:40:58] in and man she would always be bacon
[1:41:01] fresh cookies and bacon this and doing
[1:41:03] that and and just how she served roccoa
[1:41:06] I would always think man I want a wife
[1:41:07] just like Jenny
[1:41:10] and I got one
[1:41:13] it's always bacon and bread and cookies
[1:41:15] and all these different things and and
[1:41:18] just homemade and fresh and I'm thinking
[1:41:21] you know I'm I'm actually living off of
[1:41:24] the fruits of Jesse and Tracy how they
[1:41:26] raised her
[1:41:29] I think when I raised my daughter Mariah
[1:41:31] she's just going to stay at home
[1:41:34] it's tough I don't know how some of you
[1:41:37] fathers did it
[1:41:38] giving your daughter away
[1:41:41] huh is it tough brother Steve
[1:41:43] yeah
[1:41:46] I don't even want to think about it
[1:41:51] yeah Rapture amen
[1:42:00] verse 2 it says while they behold your
[1:42:03] Chase conversation coupled with fear
[1:42:05] who's adorning now notice he's still
[1:42:07] talking to the wives who's adorning let
[1:42:10] it not be that outward adorning of uh
[1:42:13] plotting the hair and of wearing of gold
[1:42:16] or putting on of apparel but let it be
[1:42:18] the hidden man of the heart in that
[1:42:21] which is not corruptable even the
[1:42:23] ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit
[1:42:25] which is in the sight of God of great
[1:42:27] price for after this manner in the old
[1:42:30] time the holy women also who trusted in
[1:42:32] God adorned themselves being in
[1:42:35] subjection onto their own husbands even
[1:42:38] as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord
[1:42:40] whose daughters ye are as long as you do
[1:42:43] well and are not afraid with any
[1:42:46] amazement
[1:42:49] what a far cry that is from the women of
[1:42:52] the world today
[1:42:54] not the women of the church not the
[1:42:56] women of the Bride but the women of the
[1:42:59] world
[1:43:00] I gotta bring myself into subjection to
[1:43:04] this guy
[1:43:06] that's why there's no more marriages
[1:43:08] anymore
[1:43:09] people just coexist with each other
[1:43:12] within the home that if something goes
[1:43:14] wrong guess what that you can just get
[1:43:16] out of here and I can get another one
[1:43:19] see marriage is marriage has lost its
[1:43:21] value
[1:43:25] how does this happen how does marriage
[1:43:28] lose its value why why one minute there
[1:43:31] and one minute not there what's the
[1:43:33] matter they lost their first love with
[1:43:35] Christ
[1:43:38] and when we leave our love for Christ
[1:43:41] guess what happens everything else just
[1:43:43] falls apart
[1:43:47] God help us
[1:43:50] God help our young men
[1:43:52] our young families
[1:43:55] to keep God the center of our lives and
[1:43:59] of our families God help our older ones
[1:44:02] to keep God the center of our lives and
[1:44:04] the center of our families
[1:44:08] amen
[1:44:10] say brother Stephen are you preaching up
[1:44:12] people
[1:44:13] because you know that there's people
[1:44:15] within the assembly that have drifted
[1:44:17] apart absolutely not
[1:44:20] I'm just preaching as I feel led how to
[1:44:22] preach
[1:44:27] God help us
[1:44:29] and go and help our youngers
[1:44:31] to learn
[1:44:33] hey what happened here
[1:44:35] what went wrong
[1:44:37] because if you know what went wrong
[1:44:39] don't do the same mistake
[1:44:43] you know what has happened to others
[1:44:45] they were in your position as young
[1:44:46] people
[1:44:48] and you think well it'll never be me
[1:44:50] it'll never be my family it'll never be
[1:44:52] this yeah it might be
[1:44:54] it might be if you don't keep your first
[1:44:56] love with God
[1:45:00] yes Lord
[1:45:06] Hallelujah some of our older sisters
[1:45:09] they might say well
[1:45:11] I've already raised my family and this
[1:45:13] and that well doesn't the Bible say it
[1:45:15] for the older to to train the youngers
[1:45:20] sure it does to teach them to be keepers
[1:45:24] at the home and to love their their
[1:45:25] their their uh husbands and and and and
[1:45:29] to raise their children in the
[1:45:31] admonition of God
[1:45:34] I wonder when the last time an elder
[1:45:37] within the assembly
[1:45:39] reached out to some of the younger
[1:45:41] sisters and said hey sis ah I can see
[1:45:45] that this is not working with your
[1:45:47] children
[1:45:49] now do you think
[1:45:51] a young sister will be able to take this
[1:45:56] huh
[1:45:58] let's stand on some toes
[1:46:03] they'll get mad all right if they're not
[1:46:05] prayed up and praying
[1:46:09] but when somebody approaches the younger
[1:46:11] and saying I see you're having trouble
[1:46:13] with your younger kid or or I see with
[1:46:17] your husband how that you talk to him or
[1:46:18] whatever it may be if you would do this
[1:46:21] instead it might help you in your life
[1:46:23] when was the last time an elder was in
[1:46:26] the assembly had a backbone to reach out
[1:46:29] to one of the younger family uh of the
[1:46:32] young of the families
[1:46:37] and scriptural
[1:46:40] it's scriptural
[1:46:43] is it easy no
[1:46:46] nobody said it would be easy but it's
[1:46:49] scriptural
[1:46:51] and so then it is also scriptural for

[1:48:42] quick scam guess what hey it's not real
[1:48:45] they're going to take your money and
[1:48:47] they're going to leave
[1:48:52] there's one way
[1:48:54] to build wealth
[1:48:55] that's to work hard
[1:48:58] that's to save hard
[1:49:00] and that's to invest what you can
[1:49:04] ain't gonna happen overnight
[1:49:08] these guys are all like man
[1:49:12] I thought it was out there
[1:49:15] it's not in Dogecoin
[1:49:18] huh

[1:49:23] on your phone
[1:49:24] well I'm gonna buy now and I'm gonna I'm
[1:49:26] gonna I'm gonna sell it when it's ten

[1:49:32] their money
[1:49:34] don't get caught up with get quick Rich
[1:49:37] scams
[1:49:40] nothing like a good old uh fashioned
[1:49:42] Hard Day's Work
[1:49:44] whether that's behind a desk
[1:49:46] or whether that's digging a ditch
[1:49:48] whatever it might be
[1:49:50] as long as you work hard
[1:49:52] this is what I listen I came from
[1:49:55] Ireland I came here with a backpack of
[1:49:57] clothes and a thousand dollars cash
[1:50:00] I'm not exactly where I wish I was
[1:50:04] should be but I'm not where I was
[1:50:07] and I have found out I've found out that
[1:50:09] when you work hard you show up on time
[1:50:12] you're faithful to your job guess what
[1:50:15] you're going to be successful no matter
[1:50:17] what it is that you do
[1:50:19] because we're living in a society where
[1:50:20] people don't want to work
[1:50:22] they want a bunch of hand me outs they
[1:50:24] want money for free they want housing
[1:50:26] for free they no there's nothing for
[1:50:28] free you gotta work for it but that's
[1:50:31] the beautiful thing about America
[1:50:33] if you work hard and you save your money
[1:50:35] you will be successful
[1:50:41] I just listened to uh uh uh podcast
[1:50:45] brother Dave Ramsey
[1:50:48] everybody know brother Dave
[1:50:53] and there was an Irish guy on there
[1:50:55] an immigrant
[1:50:57] just like me
[1:50:59] and he give out these statistics that
[1:51:04] um
[1:51:05] what was it it was something crazy about
[1:51:08] that um
[1:51:10] people who immigrate to the U.S
[1:51:13] are 20 something percent or whatever it
[1:51:16] was more likely they talk about becoming
[1:51:18] millionaire it's like I could care less
[1:51:20] about being a millionaire it's just a
[1:51:22] number
[1:51:23] um that it's a higher percentage of
[1:51:26] people who come here from another
[1:51:28] country that they actually end up living
[1:51:31] the American dream
[1:51:34] of working hard and being and being
[1:51:37] financially free
[1:51:39] it's the Americans who are raised here
[1:51:44] that they don't see what's before them
[1:51:51] they don't see the opportunity they
[1:51:53] think well the American dream is over I
[1:51:55] beg to differ
[1:51:57] I'm living it
[1:52:03] show up and work
[1:52:08] huh is this too old-fashioned
[1:52:11] huh everybody just wants to buy and sell
[1:52:13] online
[1:52:17] in their pajamas
[1:52:20] huh
[1:52:23] like
[1:52:24] that's what a what a time we're living
[1:52:26] in
[1:52:28] huh
[1:52:30] yeah
[1:52:31] by the sweat of your brow
[1:52:35] it's going to be cursed
[1:52:36] the ground is cursed why is Adam's fault
[1:52:40] listen to Eve but guess what even though
[1:52:42] it's cursed it's still going to bring
[1:52:43] forth fruit
[1:52:45] amen it just means you got to plow a
[1:52:47] little harder
[1:52:48] you got to till the ground a little
[1:52:50] harder it just means you got to sow a
[1:52:52] little more because what you sow is what
[1:52:54] you're going to reap
[1:52:57] praise the Lord okay
[1:52:59] I'll get off my
[1:53:01] Dave Ramsey stuff here
[1:53:04] Ephesians 5 25.
[1:53:06] Ephesians 5 verses 25 through 32
[1:53:09] husbands love your wives we're still
[1:53:11] talking about the husbands here
[1:53:13] even as Christ also loved the church and
[1:53:15] give himself for it
[1:53:17] for he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:53:19] with the washing of the Water by the
[1:53:20] word that he might present it to himself
[1:53:22] a glorious church not having a spot or
[1:53:24] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:53:27] should be holy and without blemish amen
[1:53:30] so what man to love their wives is their
[1:53:32] own bodies he that loveth his wife
[1:53:34] loveth himself for no man ever yet hated
[1:53:37] his own flesh but nourisheth it and
[1:53:39] cherisheth it even as the Lord
[1:53:42] the church for we are members of his
[1:53:44] body of his flesh and of his bones for
[1:53:46] this cause shall a man leave his father
[1:53:48] and mother and shall be joined onto his
[1:53:50] wife when they too shall be one flesh
[1:53:53] this is a great mystery but I speak
[1:53:55] concerning
[1:53:56] Christ and the church nevertheless
[1:54:00] let every one of you in particular so
[1:54:03] love his wife even as himself and the
[1:54:06] wife see that she reverence her husband
[1:54:11] amen we need to be taken the word of God
[1:54:15] and applying it to our lives
[1:54:17] applying it to our lives as individuals
[1:54:19] whether we're a husband or a wife a boy
[1:54:22] or a girl and say you know what the
[1:54:24] young people you could say well I'm not
[1:54:26] married but you say this is how I want
[1:54:28] to live my life is according to the
[1:54:31] scripture
[1:54:33] not according to what the world is
[1:54:36] trying to teach us but according is what
[1:54:39] the word of God wants to teach us amen
[1:54:48] what am I trying to say this morning
[1:54:51] I'm saying families that stay focused on
[1:54:53] the word of God
[1:54:54] and the roles that has been given us to
[1:54:57] play as fathers mothers wives and kids
[1:55:00] if we play our roles guess what it's all
[1:55:04] going to work out okay
[1:55:07] I could look out over this audience this
[1:55:09] morning and I can see men and women
[1:55:12] husbands and wives who have raised good
[1:55:15] Godly children of God who have respect
[1:55:20] and who have honor and who uh put God
[1:55:24] first in their lives I can look at their
[1:55:26] lives and say well what did they do they
[1:55:29] raised their families according to the
[1:55:32] word
[1:55:32] and when we raise our families and we do
[1:55:35] what is according to the word the word
[1:55:37] will have an effect
[1:55:41] don't leave off your first love
[1:55:44] amen don't leave off your first love
[1:55:46] with God but keep him the center of your
[1:55:49] family
[1:55:52] I better hurry
[1:55:54] our topic this morning is staying
[1:55:57] focused in times like these and we
[1:56:00] realize that we are living in a time of
[1:56:02] great turmoil and there's earthquakes in
[1:56:05] different places there's fires and
[1:56:06] floods and covet and all these different
[1:56:09] disasters that's happening all around
[1:56:12] the world and we realize what can what
[1:56:15] else can happen except for the coming of
[1:56:18] the Lord all these things is just
[1:56:20] pointing us to one thing as pointing
[1:56:23] pointing us to say to look up for our
[1:56:27] Redemption as drawing nigh
[1:56:32] we realize that it's happening so
[1:56:34] rapidly and it's kind of almost
[1:56:36] overwhelming that it seems like one
[1:56:39] thing happens and then another thing
[1:56:41] happens and then another thing happens
[1:56:43] and and it's just in a uh uh uh a
[1:56:46] Snowball Effect if you please that it's
[1:56:49] happening so very quickly and so very
[1:56:51] rapidly did you know that the the last
[1:56:54] several Prophecies of the Life of Christ
[1:56:57] when he hung in the cross they were all
[1:57:00] fulfilled within a few hours of each
[1:57:02] other it was a Snowball Effect and I
[1:57:04] believe that that's what's happening in
[1:57:06] this end time there's a snowball effect
[1:57:09] in the natural which is giving us a
[1:57:12] Snowball Effect because the natural is
[1:57:14] the type of the spiritual we should be
[1:57:16] having a Snowball Effect and the
[1:57:18] spiritual catching up with the
[1:57:20] Revelation that God wants to give us in
[1:57:22] order for us to get out of here
[1:57:31] we realize there's a lot going on around
[1:57:33] us there's a lot of gunfire there's a
[1:57:35] lot of voices there's a lot of screaming
[1:57:37] but I want to encourage you to stay
[1:57:39] focused stay focused on the game and the
[1:57:43] prize at hand
[1:57:45] stay focused on your family stay focused
[1:57:48] on your loved ones stay focused on your
[1:57:50] children stay focused on God and in his
[1:57:52] word
[1:57:57] we realize that as as human beings we
[1:58:00] can only focus on one thing at a time
[1:58:04] I can focus on
[1:58:06] Anthony here on the front row
[1:58:09] but everything else is in my peripheral
[1:58:10] but my focus is upon you
[1:58:13] and so we find out that whenever our
[1:58:16] Focus gets out of line and we begin to
[1:58:19] focus on other things though we are
[1:58:22] still Christians though we're still Sons
[1:58:24] and Daughters of God though we're still
[1:58:26] going to church and we're going through
[1:58:27] the rituals we realize that if we're out
[1:58:30] of focus everything is just in the
[1:58:32] peripheral
[1:58:33] and our peripheral is okay
[1:58:36] but we need our Focus to be on the word
[1:58:41] because everything else is just noises
[1:58:43] just around
[1:58:49] for just a few seconds or a few moments
[1:58:52] I would like to speak on some people who
[1:58:54] lost their focus within the scriptures
[1:58:56] Genesis 13 10-12 and lot lifted up his
[1:58:59] eyes and behold and beheld all the plain
[1:59:01] of Jordan that it was well watered
[1:59:03] everywhere before the Lord destroyed
[1:59:05] Sodom and Gomorrah even as the garden of
[1:59:07] the Lord like the land of Egypt as thou
[1:59:09] cometh onto zor then lot chose him all
[1:59:12] the plain of Jordan and Lot journeyed
[1:59:13] East and they separated themselves the
[1:59:15] one from the other Abram dwelled in the
[1:59:18] land of Canaan and not dwelled in the
[1:59:20] cities of the plain and pitched his tent
[1:59:23] toward Sodom
[1:59:25] out of all the places for lot the
[1:59:28] pitches tent he pitched his tent towards
[1:59:31] Sodom
[1:59:33] why did he pitch his tent towards Sodom
[1:59:36] and not towards the open areas and
[1:59:38] towards the uh the plains where Abram
[1:59:41] was because he lost his Focus
[1:59:45] he was more focused on popularity he was
[1:59:48] more focused on the money he was more
[1:59:50] focused on what Sodom had to offer and
[1:59:53] because that's where his Focus was
[1:59:55] that's where he pitched his tent towards
[1:59:58] understand wherever we pitch our tents
[2:00:01] towards everybody that's dwelling within
[2:00:03] our tent they will be pitched towards
[2:00:06] that same place
[2:00:08] that's why it's so important that our
[2:00:10] tents are pitched towards the cross that
[2:00:13] our tents are pitched towards the word
[2:00:15] of God because when we pitch our tent
[2:00:17] and everything that we are towards that
[2:00:20] everything else everyone else that
[2:00:22] dwells within that tent will also be
[2:00:24] pitched toward that way
[2:00:34] Hallelujah
[2:00:37] we find in second and second Samuel
[2:00:40] chapter 11.
[2:00:42] it was at the time when kings go forth
[2:00:45] to battle and as Kings and Priests we
[2:00:47] are also called to go forth to battle
[2:00:50] it was at this time that King David sent
[2:00:52] joab and the armies of Israel to go and
[2:00:55] fight and to destroy the children of
[2:00:57] Ammon but the Bible says that David
[2:01:00] tarried still at Jerusalem
[2:01:03] at a time when the Kings went out to war
[2:01:06] David was still in Jerusalem
[2:01:09] David was out of his position as a king
[2:01:12] and because he was out of his position
[2:01:15] as a king it caused a great sin in the
[2:01:19] in in the country of Israel
[2:01:22] because he was out of his position
[2:01:24] because he wasn't facing his tent toward
[2:01:28] it should have been he got wrapped up
[2:01:30] with Bathsheba
[2:01:32] and we all know the story but if David
[2:01:35] would have been in his rightful position
[2:01:37] as a king Leading the People into battle
[2:01:40] that sin never would have occurred in
[2:01:43] the life of David
[2:01:46] stay in your position
[2:01:48] stay in your position in Christ Jesus
[2:01:50] because when you stay in your position
[2:01:53] there is Comfort when you stay in your
[2:01:56] position there is protection but when we
[2:01:59] get out of our position guess what we
[2:02:01] are open to everything that the devil
[2:02:03] has to offer for us
[2:02:07] being having a position goes it's
[2:02:10] further than being a preacher
[2:02:13] playing the piano and being a song
[2:02:15] leader or a deacon
[2:02:17] each of you have a position in the body
[2:02:20] of Christ
[2:02:21] and whether God God has placed you and
[2:02:25] he has given you a family of children
[2:02:26] that is your position with that family
[2:02:29] and children and your responsibility
[2:02:32] Hallelujah
[2:02:34] to make sure that that family unit is
[2:02:37] running according to the word but when
[2:02:39] we get out of our position no matter who
[2:02:42] we are
[2:02:44] trouble
[2:02:46] comes knocking at the door
[2:02:49] and because out of your position there's
[2:02:52] no Authority there's no power
[2:02:54] you know
[2:02:56] when you're in your position and trouble
[2:02:57] comes knocking you can deal with it
[2:03:01] because you're in your position you're
[2:03:03] in your rightful position in Christ with
[2:03:05] authority and with power and you can
[2:03:07] speak to the mountain you can speak to
[2:03:09] this situation you can do these
[2:03:11] different things why because you're in
[2:03:13] your right place
[2:03:15] but when we get out of place
[2:03:17] there's nothing we can do about it
[2:03:21] until it's too late
[2:03:24] he look at the life of King Uzziah
[2:03:27] within the scripture also we find out
[2:03:29] that God really blessed the young man as
[2:03:31] a 16 year old King
[2:03:33] he blessed him so much to where Uzziah
[2:03:35] thought he could do whatever he wanted
[2:03:37] to do
[2:03:38] and so now he tries to take the place of
[2:03:40] a priest and he tries to burn incense
[2:03:43] and the priests run in and they say
[2:03:45] don't do it man this is not your
[2:03:47] position you're not supposed to be here
[2:03:49] but because God had blessed him so much
[2:03:51] he was so prideful and arrogant in his
[2:03:54] Spirit he thought he could do whatever
[2:03:55] he wanted to do and we find out that
[2:03:58] because of that prideful Spirit further
[2:04:01] Branham said that Pride was lifted up in
[2:04:03] his heart because of that prideful
[2:04:05] Spirit guess what happened God had to
[2:04:08] lower him and cause leprosy to come on
[2:04:10] his life
[2:04:12] he lost his Focus
[2:04:15] he was a great king
[2:04:17] he was a great leader he was a great
[2:04:19] leader of men but he lost his focus and
[2:04:22] he tried to take someone else's place
[2:04:27] we find that this church AZ Church age
[2:04:30] even itself was all out of focus
[2:04:34] they would say a million more and 44. it
[2:04:37] was all about numbers rather than having
[2:04:39] an experience with God it was a just
[2:04:41] make a confession oh we got a million
[2:04:44] more and 44 a million more confessions
[2:04:47] I wonder how many people really had a
[2:04:50] true experience with God not just a
[2:04:52] confession
[2:04:54] confession is okay but we gotta have an
[2:04:57] experience with God
[2:05:00] that God had baptism speaking in tongues
[2:05:03] emotions and Sensations all these things
[2:05:06] brother Brandon had to bring back into
[2:05:08] focus of the word of God
[2:05:11] spoken word is the Original Seed someone
[2:05:13] come the other day and said uh something
[2:05:16] bad about me and accusing me of
[2:05:17] something that was wrong
[2:05:19] what's the attitude
[2:05:22] I said oh forget it said how can you
[2:05:26] take take it like that that involves
[2:05:29] your family said oh my that was
[2:05:32] predestinated before the foundation of
[2:05:34] the world to give me a trial I said oh
[2:05:36] my my my sure that's all right said how
[2:05:40] do you do it I said if I look down right
[2:05:42] down this way I'd be falling all the
[2:05:45] time in other words if he looked down
[2:05:47] the weight of everybody's negative
[2:05:50] negative uh comments about them and the
[2:05:53] things that they were saying about him
[2:05:54] he said I'd be falling all the time
[2:05:59] that's the way with the people today if
[2:06:02] I accept the truth of God's word brother
[2:06:04] Branham they had kicked me out well what
[2:06:06] are you looking for
[2:06:08] look out here at the end of the road see
[2:06:10] a man who likes this he he don't know
[2:06:12] where he's gone he looking this way but
[2:06:15] if you look out yonder you don't care
[2:06:16] what's going on now you know where
[2:06:19] you're going see so in other words he's
[2:06:23] keeping his focus on the prize that's
[2:06:26] down the road Yonder everything else is
[2:06:29] peripheral it doesn't matter but he's
[2:06:32] saying as long as I keep my focus on the
[2:06:35] prize as long as I keep my focus on the
[2:06:38] word of God guess what these other
[2:06:40] things it doesn't matter
[2:06:44] that's it look where you were going stay
[2:06:48] lined up with the word
[2:06:50] all right as the musicians come we'll
[2:06:52] bring this to a close
[2:06:58] we've seen examples within the scripture
[2:07:01] no doubt if you go on you read your
[2:07:03] Bible you'll see many more examples
[2:07:05] of people like you and I of like
[2:07:08] Passions
[2:07:09] of you and I
[2:07:11] how that within the Bible God really
[2:07:13] used him at one point but at some point
[2:07:15] in their lives they lost Focus
[2:07:18] and when they lost Focus
[2:07:20] God had to do what he had to do to their
[2:07:22] lives he he had to take Uzziah and he
[2:07:25] had to Smite him with Leprosy and I was
[2:07:28] even thinking of judas's carrier
[2:07:31] he was part of the twelve
[2:07:35] he cast out Devils he prayed for the
[2:07:37] sick he did all these different things
[2:07:40] but at some point he lost his main focus
[2:07:44] of the mission that he was on and it
[2:07:47] caused him to fall the greatest fall I
[2:07:50] believe that there was ever was
[2:07:51] betraying the son of God
[2:07:57] all because they lost Focus
[2:08:00] for a Split Second
[2:08:02] for a few moments in time
[2:08:04] give their minds and give their hearts
[2:08:06] to things that they probably shouldn't
[2:08:08] shouldn't have done
[2:08:10] let pride get lifted up in their lives
[2:08:13] this happened that happened hey
[2:08:16] because they lost Focus
[2:08:19] what about you
[2:08:21] [Music]
[2:08:22] what have you been focusing on this past
[2:08:25] week
[2:08:28] what has been your main focus in your
[2:08:30] life
[2:08:31] have you been focused on other things
[2:08:34] that church and praying and reading and
[2:08:38] serving the family of God is just in our
[2:08:41] peripherals you know what's there but
[2:08:43] someone else is taking care of it
[2:08:47] what have you been focusing on
[2:08:50] what have you been focusing on in your
[2:08:52] family life
[2:08:55] have you lost Focus altogether
[2:09:00] or is it just in the peripheral of your
[2:09:02] sight
[2:09:07] that the Holy Spirit deal with your
[2:09:08] heart this morning
[2:09:11] that if you have lost Focus
[2:09:13] in a time of a lot of distractions if
[2:09:17] you have lost focus on God if you have
[2:09:20] lost focus on the word and you've been
[2:09:22] looking at different things well guess
[2:09:24] what just like I said earlier
[2:09:27] there's no time like the present to make
[2:09:29] it right
[2:09:32] why put off until tomorrow what can be
[2:09:35] done today
[2:09:37] so as we bow our heads and
[2:09:40] close our eyes
[2:09:43] I want to invite you
[2:09:46] to let the Lord deal with your heart
[2:09:51] because he can only deal with you and he
[2:09:53] can only work in your life as you let
[2:09:55] him
[2:09:58] that's what my question is this
[2:10:01] where has your focus been
[2:10:04] where have you been spending all of your
[2:10:06] time on
[2:10:07] what have you been thinking about most
[2:10:10] what have you been doing most
[2:10:13] if you realize that you know you say yes
[2:10:16] uh
[2:10:17] preacher
[2:10:19] I've gotten out of focus
[2:10:23] my focus hasn't been on the word my
[2:10:25] focus hasn't been on God my focus hasn't
[2:10:27] been on doing the things that I know I
[2:10:30] should be doing
[2:10:32] how about you make it known to God with
[2:10:34] an uplifted hand
[2:10:36] and you say Lord forgive me God sees
[2:10:38] those hands
[2:10:40] my hands are raised also
[2:10:46] and how about you just open up your
[2:10:47] heart and you say father
[2:10:49] forgive me that I have lost focus on my
[2:10:53] life
[2:10:54] forgive me that I have lost focus on the
[2:10:56] things that really matter
[2:10:59] which is your word and your people
[2:11:03] forgive me Lord for losing focus on my
[2:11:06] family and the family Altar and all
[2:11:09] these different things Lord
[2:11:11] but from this time forth father
[2:11:14] from our hearts we say Lord we want to
[2:11:17] do better
[2:11:20] father now we in the name of Jesus
[2:11:22] Christ we
[2:11:25] we put our Focus Lord back onto your
[2:11:28] word
[2:11:30] we put our Focus Lord back on to the
[2:11:33] things of God as loud as you see a lord
[2:11:35] has us torn every direction and
[2:11:38] up and down and left and right Lord and
[2:11:41] sometimes father it's hard to know where
[2:11:43] to turn we have we have family
[2:11:46] responsibilities we have work
[2:11:49] responsibilities we have these different
[2:11:51] things that we're responsible for Lord
[2:11:53] but I realize
[2:11:55] Lord that if we get out of focus none of
[2:11:58] these things matter all that matters is
[2:12:02] being in focus with you so I pray Lord
[2:12:05] forgive me forgive me for getting out
[2:12:08] for for getting out of focus Lord it
[2:12:11] seems like it happens so very easily but
[2:12:15] father I say in front of your people
[2:12:17] this morning that I'm gonna do better
[2:12:24] these binoculars as it were Lord that
[2:12:27] are out of focus I now turn them Father
[2:12:29] so that uh so that I can see plainly I I
[2:12:33] use the little the little thing in the
[2:12:35] middle there Lord and instead of seeing
[2:12:37] multiple objects I just want to see you
[2:12:41] I ask you would bless your people
[2:12:44] Lord made us little sermon have an
[2:12:47] effect
[2:12:48] may it have an effect in our lives Lord
[2:12:51] then our Focus would be regained once
[2:12:53] again I love you commit all these things
[2:12:56] into your hands for thy Kingdom's glory
[2:12:59] and Jesus Christ's name amen
[2:13:04] amen
[2:13:08] let's Stand Together
[2:13:11] [Music]
[2:13:25] [Music]
[2:13:42] for I could never
[2:13:45] ever ever
[2:13:51] the ministering Brethren could come and
[2:13:53] brother Michael and some of the deacons
[2:13:56] will go back into the corner here and
[2:13:58] we're going to offer prayer for little
[2:14:00] Josiah
[2:14:01] for sister Megan and brother Ben
[2:14:04] they're going to Florida I believe they
[2:14:06] leave on Tuesday and the operation is
[2:14:09] going to be on Friday
[2:14:11] really big deal
[2:14:13] they need our prayers
[2:14:15] [Music]
[2:14:17] but when something is a big deal in the
[2:14:19] natural we know that God supernaturally
[2:14:22] will come on the scene for his word says
[2:14:26] that if two or more people would agree
[2:14:29] on any one thing that it would come to
[2:14:32] pass this is a promise of God and Dwight
[2:14:35] is there more than two or three
[2:14:36] Believers here this morning is there
[2:14:39] more than two or three Believers that
[2:14:41] you would say I'm going to agree with
[2:14:44] you this morning that this operation is
[2:14:48] going to be a complete success
[2:14:51] the recovery is going to be a complete
[2:14:54] success that God is going to guide the
[2:14:58] surgeon's hands and that from this time
[2:15:00] forth this young man let me tell you
[2:15:03] something the miracle that God has
[2:15:05] already done in this young boy's life
[2:15:08] as Miracle after Miracle after miracle
[2:15:11] and we're not going to stop praying and
[2:15:14] we're not going to stop believing until
[2:15:16] God has finished the work in his life
[2:15:23] I guess this is a time for me to share
[2:15:25] some little dreams that I've had
[2:15:27] whenever Josiah was uh about a month old
[2:15:31] I had a dream of
[2:15:34] of uh sister Megan and and um
[2:15:38] Kristen was there
[2:15:41] her sister and I remember in my dream
[2:15:44] that have any of you ever seen brother
[2:15:46] Steve Menard how he holds his little boy
[2:15:48] facing outwards like this
[2:15:51] is not holding him in towards the
[2:15:53] shoulders holding them out the way
[2:15:55] and in my dream I seen Megan sister
[2:15:58] Megan as she was holding little Josiah
[2:16:02] and he wasn't so little he was a good
[2:16:05] sized boy probably two three years old
[2:16:08] and I seen her and she was holding him
[2:16:10] like this and I saw and I looked and I
[2:16:12] remember when I had the dream
[2:16:15] the the doctors and everything didn't
[2:16:18] give much hope
[2:16:21] and I seen it and I looked at her
[2:16:23] and I said he's okay
[2:16:26] and Kristen turned around and looked at
[2:16:29] me and she said yes
[2:16:32] okay
[2:16:34] he was good
[2:16:37] he was normal
[2:16:40] and so I remember I told Ben and
[2:16:43] everybody I told him because I don't
[2:16:45] want to be the one of these guys that
[2:16:46] says oh well I you know after everything
[2:16:50] is okay no
[2:16:51] say it put God to the test
[2:16:54] so I have an assurance within my heart
[2:16:56] because I was touched within my dream
[2:16:59] and when I woke up I was touched on my
[2:17:03] bed
[2:17:04] you know when God deals with you
[2:17:07] and so now by faith we're gonna go and
[2:17:10] we're gonna anoint the little guy and
[2:17:12] we're going to pray for him and we're
[2:17:14] going to believe and expect a complete
[2:17:17] recovery
[2:17:18] so brother Robert if you want to lead us
[2:17:20] in a song until we get down there and
[2:17:22] then we can just leave my mic on so you
[2:17:25] all can hear and agree as we pray for
[2:17:29] the family

[2:17:58] Jesus Christ then we're thankful for
[2:18:00] this life that you have given Lord and
[2:18:03] now father we are believing for a
[2:18:05] complete recovery father God that you
[2:18:08] would guide the surgeon's hands that
[2:18:10] this surgery in this operation Lord
[2:18:12] would go perfectly father God that the
[2:18:16] recovery would go perfectly and Lord
[2:18:19] that he would be a complete testimony of
[2:18:22] thy healing power father we pray for
[2:18:25] brother Ben and sister Megan that you
[2:18:27] would bless them Lord we're so proud of
[2:18:30] them of their faith in you Lord that it
[2:18:33] has been unwavering father God and we
[2:18:36] ask that you would strengthen them and

[2:18:53] that if we would lay our hands upon this
[2:18:55] they shall recover so let it be father

[2:19:01] of a man that we're saying but this is
[2:19:04] an eternal word that we have our faith
