[8:35] Come now and be

[8:43] tonight that we can go to the source of
[8:46] life. We ask brother Israel if you'd
[8:48] come tonight. Brother Israel, take us to
[8:49] the Lord in prayer. Couple of praise
[8:51] reports and several prayer requests
[8:54] tonight. A note from sister Suzanne
[8:56] says, "I had to take brother Amos to the
[8:58] hospital Sunday night. He developed a
[9:01] terrible rash and after trying
[9:03] everything without
[9:05] success. They found out he had an
[9:07] allergic reaction to an antibiotic. They
[9:10] also confirmed a kidney stone and the
[9:12] Lord is faithful. He was able to pass it
[9:13] to the hospital and is feeling much
[9:16] better. So, praise the Lord from your
[9:17] brother Amos pray. Lord, just grant him
[9:20] a complete healing touch. Brother David
[9:21] turned in a praise report tonight. Says,
[9:24] "And this testimony be for the glory of
[9:26] God. Sundays where the Mario was
[9:28] preaching, all of the sudden I lost
[9:30] almost all of the vision out of my right
[9:32] eye. I could only see a small
[9:34] brick-sized opening toward the top of my
[9:36] field of vision. As I was thinking about
[9:39] it, I thought to myself, Satan, you have
[9:40] a lot of nerve coming into my father's
[9:42] house and trying to do this to me. You
[9:45] have no authority here.
[9:48] By his stripes, I am healed. And I
[9:50] claimed the promise of God. A few
[9:51] minutes into my my eyesight was restored
[9:54] to normal. Praise
[9:57] God. Amen. God is good. He says, "Of
[10:01] course, Satan is a trickster." And a
[10:03] little later, he tried to affect my left
[10:05] eye, only not as severe. I laughed
[10:07] within myself that he would try to pull
[10:08] something like this. I claimed the same
[10:11] promise. A few minutes later, my
[10:12] eyesight was restored to normal. Praise
[10:14] the Lord. God is
[10:18] good. We serve a faithful God tonight.
[10:22] Amen. We want to pray for Sister Karen
[10:24] M. She's at home with the flu tonight.
[10:26] Pray the Lord would touch
[10:29] her. Brother Warren, Brother James, and
[10:32] several of the saints will be going to
[10:33] Mexico for some meetings this weekend.
[10:35] So, we want to pray the Lord would go
[10:37] with them. Use Brother Warren in a
[10:39] special way and just have his hand of
[10:41] protection upon them. And Brother Ron
[10:43] asked that we remember Brother Kelly
[10:45] McMillan in Edmonton. Needs a touch from
[10:47] the Lord. Special unspoken prayer
[10:49] request. you have a need tonight. If you
[10:51] just want to lift before the Lord, we'll
[10:52] ask brother Israel to take us to the
[10:54] Lord in prayer.
[10:59] Amen. Let's all
[11:01] pray. Heavenly Father, we just want to
[11:05] say what an honor it is that we can come
[11:07] into your house this evening. Lord, as
[11:09] we step inside these doors, outside
[11:12] inside from the shut in from the world,
[11:15] Lord, what a safe haven this place is
[11:18] that we could just come and sit at your
[11:20] feet that we might learn of you, Lord,
[11:23] to be more like you, Lord. How we can be
[11:26] just a positive influence to those
[11:28] around us outside of this building,
[11:31] Lord. That we could just bring our licks
[11:34] of fire this evening. come together,
[11:36] worship you, give you honor, give you
[11:38] praise, Lord, despite all the
[11:41] circumstances around us in this world
[11:43] and what's going on within it. Lord, I
[11:46] just ask you would just come by our way
[11:48] this evening. Yes. Lord, move the
[11:50] minister aside, Lord. Pray that you
[11:53] would just use him. Speak words of life
[11:55] to your people. And not only for him to
[11:58] speak, but for us to give us ears to
[12:00] hear, Lord, for what's the use if we
[12:04] don't understand. So, I just ask you
[12:06] would just come by our way, be in the
[12:08] song service, the musicians. Bless
[12:10] brother Marcus, he would lead us in
[12:11] worship. May we all just enter into that
[12:14] and bring a sweet presence amongst this
[12:16] building is my prayer. Lord, answer the
[12:19] needs of your people. You know, there
[12:20] many many that weren't pinned down
[12:22] tonight, but you know the hearts. Lord,
[12:24] you know the the need in each each of
[12:27] our lives and the things that we
[12:28] struggle with and the things that we
[12:30] need and that we all can do just a
[12:32] little bit better. So, I just ask you
[12:34] would just come by our way and be
[12:36] amongst your people this evening. We
[12:38] just love you. We thank you for your
[12:40] goodness, your grace, your mercy in our
[12:42] life. In Jesus name I pray. Amen. Amen.
[12:47] Amen. You may be seated tonight. I want
[12:49] to welcome each one to the house of the
[12:50] Lord. It's good to have our pastor,
[12:51] Sister Sandy, back with us
[12:54] and look forward to the service tonight.
[12:56] Brother Martin will be speaking for us.
[12:58] Just a couple of reminders. Of course,
[13:00] our anniversary meeting is coming up
[13:01] just a couple weeks now, a couple
[13:02] weekends, April 4th, 5th, and 6th. If

[13:16] there is a combined junior and senior
[13:18] youth meeting here at the church on
[13:20] Friday at 7 o'clock. He says there'll be
[13:23] a special guest speaker. I have no idea
[13:25] who that is, but he said it's a special
[13:26] guest speaker. And then there will be a
[13:29] Sunday school play again this Sunday
[13:31] afternoon. We've been talking about the

[28:34] Friday. Um my wife and my daughter
[28:38] Rebecca and my
[28:41] granddaughter, they all they went with
[28:45] us. And so we had Mia, Mia Grace. And uh
[28:50] so anyway uh we got there Friday night,
[28:54] went to dinner, Mia took off with her
[28:56] friend and and after dinner after we had
[28:59] our dinner. But anyway, yeah, had a nice
[29:01] big steak dinner. My my my and so
[29:05] anyway, Saturday was a a day where they
[29:09] interviewed Brother Menow and I and our
[29:11] wives. The venue went from 9:30 in the
[29:14] morning until 6:00 that night. And so it
[29:17] was a full day and uh it was lovely. We
[29:21] had lunch there and uh it was very very
[29:25] nice. And u brother Menow and I as we
[29:28] were sitting there and of course brother
[29:30] Men Menow he's got that that deep voice
[29:33] you know real preachers's voice. God
[29:36] bless you all this evening you know you
[29:38] know just that that deep baritone type
[29:41] voice. And uh you know and then they'd
[29:44] ask me questions. Yes. And when you
[29:48] know, have any of you ever heard
[29:51] yourself
[29:52] uh on a recording or something like that
[29:54] and you go, "Oh my my
[29:57] my everybody else sounds so good and you
[30:00] uh hear your own voice and you." So you
[30:04] guys really put up with me. I appreciate
[30:06] it. But God bless you. Amen. And uh so
[30:11] uh during the time the the venue there
[30:17] um they went ahead and asked brother
[30:19] Menow to what was it like when you met
[30:23] uh brother Brandham and and the early
[30:26] part of the ministry there uh and you
[30:29] were in some services and and everything
[30:32] and then they interviewed me and and it
[30:34] was really brother Ed Hammermeister. He
[30:37] said really we have two ministers here
[30:39] from opposite ends of the spectrum.
[30:42] Brother Menow comes from a Menanite very
[30:45] religious strict uh background and here
[30:48] I come from something opposite a surfer
[30:51] out of California and and everything. So
[30:54] uh uh and I asked Ed Hammermeister he
[30:57] said well we want to get the the elders
[31:00] to and I said since when did I become an
[31:02] elder? uh you know uh but whenever I
[31:06] travel now and I go to meetings I'm
[31:09] usually one of the older ones in the
[31:11] meeting and uh so um I guess I am an
[31:17] elder
[31:18] uh and so they then they even had our
[31:21] wives uh get up there with us and they
[31:24] asked them Sandy took more time than
[31:26] anybody but uh no she didn't she
[31:31] uh but Uh, no, we had a very good time
[31:36] there with them. And, uh, I bring
[31:39] greetings from brother Ed
[31:42] Hammermeister, brother Eugene
[31:45] Braraw, brother
[31:48] Menofen, brother uh, Jerry
[31:51] Fury and brother
[31:53] Seagclar and brother Martin Warner
[31:56] there. That was the ones that we had.
[31:59] Uh, the ministers that I know. There
[32:01] might have been a few others perhaps I
[32:03] didn't recognize them but uh also
[32:06] brother Gustaf Pankin is here slipped in
[32:10] again. God bless brother Gustaf sister
[32:13] Aneta I appreciate them uh very much.
[32:16] He's a pastor from Germany. God bless
[32:19] you richly, brother Gusta. And
[32:23] um so um I wanted to just read something
[32:28] because some ask different questions on
[32:32] concerning the ministries that we have
[32:34] here at the
[32:35] assembly. And so I wanted to read
[32:38] something here from the scripture. If
[32:40] you don't mind, let me take just a
[32:42] second.
[32:44] The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 12 verse
[32:47] one. Now concerning spiritual
[32:51] gifts, brethren, I would not have you
[32:55] ignorant. And we'll go to verse four
[32:58] now. Now there are diversities of gifts
[33:02] but the same
[33:03] spirit. Diversities of gifts. The gifts
[33:06] are different.
[33:08] I will preach on this perhaps at some
[33:11] time. And there are differences of
[33:13] administrations of how they're
[33:16] administered,
[33:18] but the same Lord. There are diversities
[33:23] of
[33:24] operations. They may operate a little
[33:26] bit differently, but it's the same God
[33:29] which workketh all in all. Amen. Verse
[33:33] 11, but all these workketh at one same
[33:36] spirit, dividing to every man severally
[33:39] as he will. And so different ones come
[33:42] from different backgrounds, perhaps
[33:45] different countries. They have an
[33:47] approach to the word that might be a
[33:50] little different than what you're used
[33:51] to. And you have to listen uh carefully.
[33:56] uh especially uh I'm not uh brother
[34:00] Martin is speaking tonight and he has a
[34:02] certain approach to the word and uh he
[34:06] has uh you know because English is his
[34:10] second language though I'll tell you
[34:12] what he is so gifted in languages and
[34:16] one of these days I want to use him as a
[34:18] translator here at the pulpit
[34:20] translating as fast as you can preach in
[34:23] English he can translate it and stuff.
[34:26] But sometimes um they take different
[34:30] angles,
[34:34] diversities,
[34:35] [Music]
[34:37] operations, the way they see it, the way
[34:40] they put it together, you know, they
[34:42] come from other ministries perhaps
[34:45] overseas and they develop their own
[34:51] uh let's call it
[34:54] uh way of putting it together. It's like
[34:57] every one of you sisters go to the same
[35:01] market or somewhere to buy your
[35:04] groceries, but the way you put it on the
[35:06] plate is so different than others. Amen.
[35:09] Okay. It's diversities.
[35:11] And so it is even there with the
[35:14] ministries. But if you'll
[35:16] find, if you'll listen carefully and if
[35:19] you understand perhaps backgrounds and
[35:22] where he comes from, he may go over here
[35:25] and take this and and this and then tie
[35:28] it over here and he's developing a
[35:31] picture. And I tell all of our
[35:33] ministers, every one of them, when you
[35:36] get up and minister,
[35:39] uh it should be something that completes
[35:42] a picture. Amen. Okay. Because if it
[35:45] leaves you in a mystery like what did he
[35:49] say? Where where did he take me? What
[35:51] was the quote was good, the scripture
[35:53] was good, but how did you tie it
[35:55] together? And some men are very very
[35:58] gifted at being able to tie them all
[36:00] together and put it together and and uh
[36:03] stuff. So um uh I and some I give so
[36:10] that you guys
[36:11] understand I will give lateral
[36:14] movement. What I mean by lateral
[36:17] movement is uh perhaps he will take a
[36:20] certain direction of what the prophet
[36:23] said and what the scriptures said but
[36:26] he's not interpreting
[36:27] it. Okay? He's just saying, "Well, look
[36:31] at it this way and whatever." And some
[36:33] may even say, "Well, uh, it looks as
[36:36] though you're adding to or taking away."
[36:39] Per first off, understand I would never
[36:41] allow
[36:43] that. Okay? If they do some lateral
[36:47] movement, ah, okay, come on.
[36:50] uh you know, but uh I would not stand
[36:53] for anyone to come and and be preaching
[36:57] something that's uh not substantiated in
[37:00] the scripture nor in the message. Amen.
[37:03] So anyway, I just say that on behalf of
[37:05] all of our um ministering brethren that
[37:09] are here, notice they are diversities of
[37:13] gifts,
[37:15] diversities of operations.
[37:18] So when you understand Excuse me. When
[37:22] you understand that, then you then you
[37:24] can give a a whole lot more grace. Let's
[37:27] sing another song. Let's have our
[37:29] brother Martin Malumba come out here and
[37:31] minister. Uh I personally enjoy
[37:35] sometimes his different viewpoints on
[37:37] different things what he says. I do. And
[37:40] it shows that he definitely gets into
[37:43] reading the word and and that and uh
[37:46] brother Mario, God bless you. I asked
[37:49] how did he do? Uh, one of the brothers
[37:51] said, "Man, he come out. I thought it
[37:53] was just going to be a a simple little
[37:55] sermon and man, he come out
[37:57] really firing away." So, I appreciate
[38:00] that. God bless you, brother Mario.
[38:02] Amen. Let's stand together. Change the
[38:04] order of the service. Brother Mark and
[38:07] say, "You are my refuge. You're my
[38:09] sanctuary." Amen.
[38:13] You are my refuge.
[38:17] You're my
[38:21] sanuary when I feel
[38:25] afraid. You're my hiding place. You are
[38:30] my
[38:32] refuge. And when the
[38:35] storm is
[38:37] raging underneath your
[38:41] wings, I rejoice and sing for you are my
[38:46] Sing it
[38:48] again. You are my
[38:52] refuge. You're my
[38:57] sanuary when I feel afraid.
[39:02] You're my hiding place. You are my
[39:08] refuge. And when the
[39:11] storm is
[39:13] raing underneath your
[39:17] wings, I rejoice and sing. You are my
[39:22] Let's sing it one more time as brother
[39:23] Martin comes. You are my refuge.
[39:29] You're
[39:32] [Music]
[39:34] my
[39:35] [Music]
[39:37] feel. You're my hiding place. You are my
[39:44] refuge. And when the
[39:46] storm is
[39:49] raing underneath your
[39:53] wings, I rejoice and sing. You are my
[39:58] refuge.
[40:01] Shall we pray? Precious heavenly father,
[40:05] once
[40:06] again in the house we standing Lord in
[40:10] your sanctuary. Father, yes.
[40:13] [Music]
[40:15] There was a city lifted in the days of
[40:19] Joshua in order God to find a
[40:24] refuge. After a time, Lord, it pleased
[40:27] you not, Lord, Father God, to find a
[40:30] mountain or a place, a natural place to
[40:35] be hidden into, but you chose our heart,
[40:38] Lord. Thank you, Lord. While the world
[40:41] is looking for you, seeking to where to
[40:44] find you, but by your grace, you came
[40:46] and you revealed us, Lord, where you
[40:48] are, Father.
[40:51] Job wanted to come and speak to you. But
[40:53] in this day, we come Lord Father God
[40:56] with boldness before the throne of
[40:59] grace because of the shed blood of Jesus
[41:02] Christ. Thank you Lord. And this blood
[41:05] has come down Lord in the form of the
[41:08] word in this last hour
[41:11] revealing unto us Lord the pathway to
[41:13] glory.
[41:15] Wow. Lord Father God, the world is
[41:17] seeking, Lord, Father God, a new
[41:19] governance, a new ways, a new president
[41:22] that can do better things, Father. But
[41:25] you have shown us your program, telling
[41:27] us, Lord, I fear not little flock. It
[41:29] pleased the father to give you the
[41:32] kingdom. A place where there will be
[41:35] peace, no
[41:37] hunger, no stress or anything of any
[41:40] kind, Lord. Oh, Lord. But we standing
[41:43] faithful once again tonight. looking
[41:45] Lord Father God into thy word. May you
[41:47] take it over. Open unto us Lord things
[41:50] that we have never seen Lord Father God
[41:53] before because Lord like the burst of
[41:55] the Roman candle it goes on and on and
[41:58] on Lord Father and this is Lord Father
[42:01] God the eternal
[42:03] light as Lord Father God Daniel Kerry
[42:06] was uh carried in that light Lord the
[42:09] brighter the closer it got Lord and the
[42:11] brighter it was Lord the same way Lord
[42:14] as we get into the word let it be Lord
[42:16] Father God deeper and deeper Lord to
[42:19] keep us low. Father God, I thirst Lord
[42:21] for more. As we're looking away again
[42:24] unto you, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name
[42:26] we ask and pray. Amen. Amen. May the
[42:31] Lord bless you once again
[42:33] tonight. Uh we shall take our Bibles in
[42:38] the book of uh Exodus 26.
[42:55] Exodus 26. Uh you can read the entire
[42:59] chapter that covers uh the whole uh
[43:03] element. Thank you musicians. I always
[43:05] forget you there.
[43:08] uh chapter verse 1 to 5, but you can
[43:11] read the entire idea uh in the whole
[43:16] chapter. We're still on to
[43:18] uh what house wil thou build me? Exodus
[43:22] uh 26:1. Moreever, thou shalt make the
[43:26] tabernacle with the 10 curtains of fine
[43:30] twin linen and blue and purple and
[43:32] scarlet with cherubims of cunning work
[43:35] shalt thou make them. The length of one
[43:38] curtain shall be eight and 20 cubic and
[43:41] the breath of one curtain four
[43:44] cubics and every one of the curtain
[43:48] shall have one measure. The five
[43:51] curtains shall have shall be coupled
[43:53] together one to another. And other five
[43:56] curtains shall be coupled one to
[43:59] another. And thou shalt make the loops
[44:02] of blue upon the the edge of the one
[44:04] curtain from the uh slave edge in the
[44:08] coupling. And likewise shalt thou make
[44:10] the outermost edge of what? of another
[44:13] curtain and in the coupling of the
[44:16] second. 50 loops shalt thou make the uh
[44:20] in the one curtain and 50 loops shalt
[44:23] thou make in the edges of that curtain
[44:26] is in the coupling of the second that
[44:29] the loops may take hold of one another.
[44:32] May the Lord bless the reading of his
[44:34] word. You may be seated. Uh once again,
[44:38] thank you, brother Ron, and uh the
[44:41] entire church for making it tonight and
[44:44] the opportunity to stand before you to
[44:46] share the word of the Lord.
[44:49] uh I believe as uh the pastor stated it
[44:53] different administration when you come
[44:55] in the word uh surely there's always uh
[45:01] uh one thing that uh one of the previous
[45:04] pastors that I was under
[45:07] uh stated that u when God calls you he
[45:11] has to give you a particular gift it's
[45:14] not uh a copy and past of uh the
[45:18] previous ministries and and things like
[45:20] that. uh just as we see in the family
[45:24] that uh uh from the same father comes
[45:28] children of uh different uh
[45:31] characteristics, height and hair colors
[45:34] and and and all these things and uh the
[45:38] father himself can recognize his traits
[45:40] in the children but the child would say
[45:42] like you know I am particular no you're
[45:44] just the father's child the father's
[45:47] child after the day after all uh the
[45:50] same way as uh uh just adding up to what
[45:53] he stated there
[45:56] uh as uh the Lord has given us the
[45:59] opportunity to go about many places and
[46:05] we've come to understand a little bit
[46:08] the bride the way they behave and and uh
[46:11] we love that the way the God has uh made
[46:15] his children created them to behave in a
[46:19] certain manner. Yeah. And one of the
[46:21] challenges that um at times that
[46:26] uh when you grow under a c a certain
[46:30] influence
[46:32] uh we would think that uh that's all
[46:37] there is in the world.
[46:39] But then when God blesses you a little
[46:41] bit and you start traveling and you
[46:44] start visiting other areas and you start
[46:46] realizing, oh, I never seen that. Oh,
[46:50] they also cook rice like this. Oh,
[46:52] beans. They cook also cook beans like
[46:54] this. And then when you start eating all
[46:57] those things, especially it was an eye
[47:00] opening when I went to uh to Mexico and
[47:03] to see the way they cook beans out there
[47:06] comparatively to what I was acquainted
[47:08] to. You say like okay oh beans with no
[47:12] spices, nothing. Okay, this is uh this
[47:16] is interesting. But then over time it
[47:18] becomes some of the favorite. Oh, let's
[47:20] have some Mexican food and let you know.
[47:23] by God's grace and it is the same way uh
[47:26] as we we the nature types the spiritual
[47:30] amen uh it is the same way at times like
[47:33] you know the lord will give you uh a
[47:36] certain opening that's why I love to
[47:38] fellowship with the brethren you know at
[47:41] times I believe we were with uh brother
[47:43] Vega we were sitting there and he
[47:46] started typing the church ages in in the
[47:49] spectrum of light and I just sat there
[47:51] and I was like yeah He might not be a
[47:54] minister but God has given him uh you
[47:56] know some great openings that say like
[47:58] you know brother can you send me those
[48:00] and I want to learn from it you know by
[48:03] God's grace and it is the same way you
[48:05] know deacons and uh ministers and and
[48:09] everybody you know you that will never
[48:12] end you know those that will those will
[48:14] come after us so don't just try to be to
[48:17] preach like us like you know I want to
[48:18] preach like him and I want to know the
[48:20] way no no go to
[48:22] He had he has a lot in store. You know,
[48:26] you might not understand it, but Ron has
[48:28] said it multiple times. So, he might
[48:30] preach something in a way for many years
[48:34] and the person doesn't get it. And then
[48:36] somebody else comes like, you know, but
[48:38] I've been preaching this all these
[48:39] years, you know, but it's just God's way
[48:42] of uh doing things. And hol is for his
[48:46] glory because if uh if it's a whole in
[48:49] one person he knows everything has all
[48:52] the types and all the shadows by himself
[48:55] you know then all the glory comes back
[48:57] to him before you know it you know we
[48:59] have a nimrod in the room and we don't
[49:01] want that but we believe by God's grace
[49:04] and if it keeps you in an area of shadow
[49:07] to a certain extent it's good just stay
[49:10] there in that shadow and you know pray
[49:13] to him but Program says that you know
[49:15] revelation will come as you have need of
[49:17] it. You know don't don't come to church
[49:20] just to be a good listening uh service
[49:23] and then you go out. Now he wants to
[49:26] teach us certain things so that we can
[49:29] be aware and be ready for what is to
[49:31] come. Amen. uh to for tonight probably
[49:35] yes uh already from the reading it's
[49:38] probably not common to have uh this type
[49:40] of approach but we are talking of the
[49:43] tabernacle will have all these things in
[49:45] the message but then
[49:48] uh I have this background of the prophet
[49:52] tells me take the Bible take the message
[49:55] that's my my only background that I have
[49:57] and and uh when I read the Bible and I
[50:01] see it in the message I have the freedom
[50:03] to preach it
[50:05] because it's the Bible. It's the
[50:08] message. It speaks of the same thing and
[50:11] uh that will never change and and
[50:13] forever more. Amen. Um uh tonight we're
[50:17] speaking about the outer court. Uh God's
[50:20] grace, God willing, uh we'll try to
[50:25] um cover a little bit of a ground here.
[50:28] Uh probably not the way it was always
[50:31] been. uh presented previously but or
[50:35] before but but God's grace I don't want
[50:38] to make it too long. I want to keep it
[50:40] short in order to go into some other
[50:44] things that are pulling into my heart
[50:45] but God's grace.
[50:49] Um we seeing that uh the tabernacle that
[50:53] we started speaking about we starting in
[50:55] Genesis 15. We went into uh Exodus 3 and
[51:01] Exodus 12. Uh Exodus 3, the pillar of
[51:06] fire meeting Moses. He told him uh to
[51:09] pick to have the children of Israel to
[51:11] pick between among the sheeps and the
[51:14] goats and and uh the goats had to be
[51:18] offered perfect lamb because this
[51:20] perfect lamb will be the sacrificial
[51:22] lamb that has to be uh spare them from
[51:25] the danger or the killing from the angel
[51:29] of death. And there about we continue
[51:32] that in Exodus 12
[51:35] uh the children of Israel came about.
[51:39] The Lord said that you know have the
[51:41] army of the Lord came out and the Lord
[51:43] told them to bring a will offering unto
[51:48] the Lord to make him the tabernacle. And
[51:51] uh the last service we covered that uh
[51:54] around the tabernacle we had ministers
[51:57] the Levites particularly the tribe of
[52:00] Levi that was set round about in order
[52:03] to minister unto the the tabernacle. And
[52:08] uh for tonight I want to start with the
[52:09] tabernacle itself. So God willing, I
[52:12] hope uh it may doesn't make it uh too
[52:16] long because it's a a blessing when he's
[52:19] teaching it to you because at times when
[52:22] we my experience is many times when I
[52:26] leave the pulpit he will probably go on
[52:28] for three, four, five days and he keeps
[52:31] preaching me preaching giving it to me
[52:33] but I can bring everything on the pulpit
[52:35] unfortunately and I just have to keep
[52:37] moving on and stuff um For tonight, we
[52:41] jumping to Exodus 26. As we just read,
[52:45] uh we seeing that the Lord had the
[52:47] tabernacle that had to be built. Uh the
[52:51] tabernacle had to be made with specific
[52:54] element. uh as I stated uh in the last
[52:57] service that when we look at uh the
[53:00] physical part of it which is could be
[53:03] for the most part not looked onto uh
[53:07] given too much importance because of the
[53:09] reasons that uh the lord has given
[53:12] revelation to the brethren um but I want
[53:16] to start with uh the outer quote in this
[53:18] outer quote the lord said I you'll make
[53:21] the tabernacle with a certain manner but
[53:24] we can clearly see from the reading
[53:26] where we just had that the Lord himself
[53:29] didn't just say like you know hey just
[53:30] go and build the outer court the way you
[53:33] want but he says you know moreover thou
[53:36] shalt make the tabernacle with 10
[53:38] curtains and he start going into the
[53:41] every single details the loops of the of
[53:44] of the curtains and uh if you read the
[53:47] entire chapter you see he said like you
[53:49] know you're going to make the frame in
[53:51] this way and and he even gives uh the
[53:54] type of labor that he gives to the
[53:56] children of uh of uh of Levi certain
[54:01] families to take care of uh that part
[54:03] and to remove the curtains and to put
[54:06] them up and according to the families
[54:09] they have to do a rotation and uh that
[54:12] whole mystery understand that we can
[54:14] cover it all but by God's grace we give
[54:18] a little bit of an idea and uh show it
[54:20] in the message by God's grace and then
[54:23] we move onto something else. But it's
[54:26] really really a blessing unto myself and
[54:29] I believe that uh those who are
[54:31] interested in the word will be able to
[54:34] see it and understand by God's leader
[54:37] under God's leadership.
[54:39] um as uh to say it just like the prophet
[54:42] says you know hey it if it doesn't make
[54:46] any sense you know we have the pastor
[54:49] reach out and uh I'll provide more
[54:51] details and you know over lunch and
[54:54] stuff but God's grace because I know
[54:56] some of the things on a one-on-one basis
[54:59] you know the spirit is more focused on
[55:02] one area comparatively to when it's a a
[55:05] church a mixed audience and uh the Lord
[55:08] usually goes on to to deal with people
[55:10] of different backgrounds and in order to
[55:14] give them a little bit of food on the
[55:16] plate. Um he shows that all the loops of
[55:21] the tabernacle, the outer court and
[55:23] every single details, the Lord himself
[55:26] comes down to Moses and tells them
[55:29] exactly how they have to make the
[55:31] tabernacle. And this tabernacle by
[55:34] looking at it by virtue of just the Holy
[55:37] Spirit Moses came and told the children
[55:40] of Israel what they have to do and how
[55:43] they have to do it. Of course, they had
[55:46] all these backgrounds that they had uh
[55:48] from uh from Egypt that they could
[55:50] probably just like, you know, build
[55:52] because, you know, to this day, the
[55:54] prophet shows us that
[55:57] um Egypt had made some great
[56:00] constructions that to this day hard to
[56:02] to rebuild. But
[56:04] nevertheless, this tabernacle was not to
[56:07] be made after the men of the Egyptians.
[56:10] No. Therefore, the Lord brings this
[56:13] together. And the type of the tabernacle
[56:15] that we are speaking of, brother says uh
[56:18] in the message a hidden life in Christ
[56:20] 55 it say just like
[56:23] God in the three courts he surely lives
[56:27] in the court of the congregation meaning
[56:29] the outer court he lives he also lives
[56:32] here in the holy place. Um uh uh he
[56:36] lives in the holy place. This was just
[56:39] a this this was just attributes of his
[56:43] presence from the
[56:45] holy it's just like you if you'll notice
[56:48] the Bible mathematically speaking you
[56:52] know that's where like you know when
[56:53] you're reading the Bible you're reading
[56:55] the prophet it just gives you
[56:56] instruction on how to access access the
[56:59] Bible you know just reading the Bible uh
[57:02] the message like you know I've listened
[57:04] to uh uh a tape but He start giving you
[57:09] the way of accessing the Bible, how to
[57:12] read the Bible. It's not like, you know,
[57:13] oh, Moses did this. No, no, no, no. He's
[57:16] giving us specifically. He says like,
[57:17] you know, mathematic mathematically, you
[57:21] know, you went to school now all your
[57:24] algebra and all your geometry and all
[57:28] these things are start coming back into
[57:31] view. Okay. Is that important? Yes, it
[57:33] is important.
[57:36] Everything is important in God's word.
[57:38] Mathematically speaking, the three is
[57:41] God's God's perfected number. God is
[57:44] perfected in three. The Godhead is
[57:46] perfected in three. Father, Son, and
[57:49] Holy Spirit. The one true God and the
[57:52] dispensation are perfected in three.
[57:55] 37s, 12elves, 24, 40s, and 50s is is
[58:02] God's mathematical number. And when you
[58:06] dwell on this one a single quote, it
[58:09] will open the entire Bible into a whole
[58:12] different scenario. You start seeing the
[58:14] 12 patriarchs and the the 24 elders and
[58:18] and all these things. It just opens up
[58:21] the word to you that you can stop. But
[58:24] just by listening to one tape, even one
[58:27] minute, and you spend the entire week
[58:30] studying in whole different things and
[58:32] probably reviewing your uh your your
[58:34] school books and stuff. Now just uh and
[58:39] it runs completely through the
[58:42] scriptures.
[58:44] This
[58:45] mathematics, this geometry, all these
[58:48] things runs perfectly in the scripture.
[58:51] Amen. That's why when he's saying you
[58:54] shall make the tabernacle, he's pulling
[58:57] all these backgrounds into view.
[59:00] Remember he said like you know I've
[59:02] called Bezal of the tribe of Judah to
[59:06] make the tabernacle and I've given them
[59:08] wisdom and understanding and this wisdom
[59:12] understanding is this mathematics this
[59:15] perfection to bring into view in order
[59:17] to build the tabernacle. And this
[59:20] building is not the building of the a
[59:22] human because they went to school and
[59:25] they've built us all these things that
[59:27] we are thankful for. But then this
[59:30] building here that we are building the
[59:33] one the one the two and the three is
[59:36] specifically placing it according as
[59:38] this brother says now it's just like you
[59:42] you are made out of three parts your
[59:45] body your spirit and your soul and this
[59:48] body that we are speaking of it has to
[59:50] run throughout the scripture and if it's
[59:53] not in the scripture then the picture
[59:56] that we are painting then is wrong
[59:59] because he said like you know thou shalt
[1:00:02] make it according that you have seen up
[1:00:05] there and has Moses is bringing the
[1:00:08] pardon of the tabernacle then bel now
[1:00:12] has to take the silver the gold that
[1:00:14] they have received from the Egyptians in
[1:00:17] order to build the tabernacle
[1:00:20] and notice you yourself you are
[1:00:23] perfected in three soul body spirit
[1:00:26] water and spirit
[1:00:29] the prophet is laying out. So now we are
[1:00:31] focusing just only on the body part and
[1:00:34] then by God's grace we'll uh uh go on
[1:00:37] onto the rest of the stuff and then uh
[1:00:40] this body of ours we understand that we
[1:00:43] are the product of our father and mother
[1:00:45] and we have all inherited certain
[1:00:47] spirits of our environment of uh all
[1:00:50] these things that we have covered
[1:00:52] previously particularly under uh Nimro
[1:00:56] invasions and all these things and under
[1:00:59] communism. You know, when I was a little
[1:01:01] boy, before I was a Christian, this
[1:01:04] would come to me and would speak to me
[1:01:06] and tell me things that were going to
[1:01:09] happen. Well, I would scare it would
[1:01:12] scare it would scare me to death. I
[1:01:14] would be nervous and troublem about it.
[1:01:17] I spoke to it spoke to me first in a
[1:01:20] bush like a wind whirlwind in a bush.
[1:01:23] And he told me never to drink or to
[1:01:26] smoke or defile my body. that there will
[1:01:30] be a work for me to do. And the Lord has
[1:01:33] is wanting us to build the tabernacle,
[1:01:36] he has specifically for work to be done.
[1:01:39] And as uh these things that the Lord is
[1:01:43] laying out through the scriptures, it's
[1:01:45] showing us that hey, we have a
[1:01:48] tabernacle that is given onto us. We
[1:01:51] have all this understanding, all these
[1:01:53] backgrounds that we have. We are smart.
[1:01:55] We are intelligent. We are able to do
[1:01:58] all kind of things. But then let's
[1:01:59] remember that that body that God has
[1:02:02] given unto us was is given to us for a
[1:02:06] specific work to be done. Amen. And as
[1:02:10] Moses was giving them specifically the
[1:02:13] entire book of Exodus shows us in Exodus
[1:02:17] 40 comes to the fulfillment the purpose
[1:02:20] where unto the tabernacle was built.
[1:02:23] Because without a tabernacle there's
[1:02:25] worship.
[1:02:27] And if there's no worship then there's
[1:02:30] no fellowship.
[1:02:32] Because when we come to we invited at
[1:02:35] somebody's house it has to open us the
[1:02:38] door. We don't start with uh the bedroom
[1:02:42] but we start with the living room. This
[1:02:45] is where we are received depending and
[1:02:48] uh I will feel welcome just by the way I
[1:02:51] am received at the door. Amen. And if I
[1:02:55] am welcome brother I'm saying like you
[1:02:56] know you will tell me like you know feel
[1:02:58] free feel at home. Show me the kitchen
[1:03:01] you show me different places. But then
[1:03:04] depending on the level of affinity that
[1:03:07] we have with one person to another then
[1:03:10] the visitor say like you know hey I can
[1:03:13] have you access this area that area but
[1:03:17] not the bedroom right but then if
[1:03:20] there's a different level of fellowship
[1:03:22] for those who are married then there's
[1:03:25] no limit to the access to to anything
[1:03:29] there's no access to the bank accounts
[1:03:32] there's no uh there's no limit limit of
[1:03:34] access to the bank accounts. There's no
[1:03:35] limit of access to everything that we
[1:03:38] know. But then in the nature, if we have
[1:03:42] a different scenario, he doesn't trust
[1:03:46] her, he doesn't know all the bank
[1:03:48] accounts he has, then we know that
[1:03:50] there's no complete fellowship, right?
[1:03:52] There's only a limited fellowship.
[1:03:54] Right. But then in this outer quote that
[1:03:58] the prophet is showing us that hey
[1:04:00] there's a work for you to be done to do
[1:04:03] when you shall grow when you shall go
[1:04:05] when you shall grow and brother Brandham
[1:04:08] along his life he find himself that this
[1:04:12] element was dragging his life and down
[1:04:16] through life I tried to live to be a
[1:04:18] gentleman and I was misunderstood.
[1:04:21] Why the body has to be restricted to a
[1:04:25] certain level of behaviors. And even my
[1:04:27] father said I was a big cece because I
[1:04:30] didn't like to I didn't like I didn't I
[1:04:34] didn't because I didn't drink like the
[1:04:37] rest of the brands because in our
[1:04:40] culture this is what we do because in
[1:04:42] our church this is how we preach because
[1:04:46] this is here but then when the Lord
[1:04:48] comes to you then he gives you a certain
[1:04:51] a different pathway to access the word
[1:04:54] to conduct yourself in a certain manner.
[1:04:56] Huh? Because there's a work for you to
[1:04:58] do. And therefore in this body we are
[1:05:02] behaving, addressing, talking, be using
[1:05:06] that body in a certain manner because we
[1:05:09] are following a certain objective.
[1:05:15] We are just in the outer court. It's not
[1:05:18] the spirit yet. It's not the soul yet.
[1:05:21] Because the body says, you know, my even
[1:05:23] my own father couldn't understand me.
[1:05:26] Why do I have to dress the way I dress?
[1:05:30] Not because somebody told him, you have
[1:05:33] to do it. But the voice told him not to
[1:05:37] behave like that. Don't do like the rest
[1:05:40] of them.
[1:05:43] But then the influence we have today,
[1:05:45] it's like, you know, hey, sister so and
[1:05:47] so is doing it. Why not I?
[1:05:52] the influence of one another.
[1:05:55] Yes, sir. But then that influence also
[1:05:58] is leading you somewhere. That's right.
[1:06:02] We take our influences from some
[1:06:04] pictures that we have seen of somebody
[1:06:06] that we have great respect for and we
[1:06:09] say like we'll dress like her,
[1:06:12] we'll behave like him.
[1:06:15] But then this body, the prophet is
[1:06:17] showing next, hey, you shall make it
[1:06:21] mathematically to build this
[1:06:24] tabernacle according to a certain
[1:06:27] pattern because there's a work for you
[1:06:29] to do.
[1:06:31] The body,
[1:06:33] yes. Otherwise, that body could be any
[1:06:37] kind of
[1:06:38] body. Otherwise, the Lord could use the
[1:06:41] animals to preach the gospel. Yeah.
[1:06:43] Otherwise, the Lord could use the
[1:06:46] mechanical devices to preach the gospel.
[1:06:49] But he said, "No, I've chosen a man."
[1:06:53] Let us create man after our own image
[1:06:56] and likeness.
[1:06:58] For him to do what? To dominate there.
[1:07:01] And when he placed him there in Genesis
[1:07:04] 3, it said like, you know, and he
[1:07:06] breathed the breath of life in the body
[1:07:09] that he created.
[1:07:11] But he said to that body, "The day that
[1:07:13] you shall eat from here, that day you
[1:07:16] shall die."
[1:07:18] And when the man doubted God's
[1:07:21] leadership on how to behave with the
[1:07:23] tabernacle, he said like, you know,
[1:07:25] "Have you eaten from what I have
[1:07:29] forbidden you to eat?" He said like,
[1:07:31] then they started pushing uh pointing
[1:07:33] the fingers to one another, right? And
[1:07:36] that's what we do. Oh, no. Because like
[1:07:38] you know, didn't you see brother Brham's
[1:07:40] wife?
[1:07:42] Didn't you see brother Brham do this?
[1:07:44] Didn't you see that the pastor's wife
[1:07:46] did it? Yeah. The same way in Genesis,
[1:07:50] there's nothing new under the sun. Amen.
[1:07:53] And then we have to understand that
[1:07:55] there are consequences that that goes
[1:07:57] along with behaving in that manner.
[1:08:01] True. He said like, you know, but but
[1:08:03] there was something in my
[1:08:05] heart. But but there was something in my
[1:08:08] heart wouldn't let me drink. It was
[1:08:11] Christ. Amen.
[1:08:14] Something in his heart was telling him,
[1:08:16] "Hey, that body of yours.
[1:08:20] Don't use it however you want. Don't
[1:08:23] dress it however you want." Right? You
[1:08:26] go, you look on TV and you say like, you
[1:08:28] know, I'll put some chains on my ankle.
[1:08:30] I'll put a little bit of a hairstyle
[1:08:32] like this and I'll behave like the rest
[1:08:34] of the world.
[1:08:38] Remember, there's a pattern. There's a
[1:08:39] program.
[1:08:42] You take the entire book of J of Exodus,
[1:08:44] you can see from the very beginning all
[1:08:47] the way to the end. Just as we saw that
[1:08:49] the children of uh of of Aaron came
[1:08:52] about and offered a strange fire, right,
[1:08:56] in the tabernacle?
[1:08:58] What did God do? Kill them. Amen. He's
[1:09:00] showing the importance that every single
[1:09:04] part of the tabernacle, he had conceived
[1:09:07] it. He had brought it forth. He had
[1:09:09] given it to Moses. And Moses had came
[1:09:12] and proclaimed it. He had seen how the
[1:09:15] tabernacle come about. And he had come
[1:09:18] and consecrated the tabernacle. And here
[1:09:21] now comes somebody who didn't think
[1:09:23] about it, who didn't even mind about
[1:09:27] this and come and offer a strange fire.
[1:09:32] Have you ever bought a car
[1:09:35] and then you find somebody has just like
[1:09:37] you know keyed your car?
[1:09:41] What feeling do you have at that time?
[1:09:45] I paid some money for this. I worked for
[1:09:48] this. I lay my blood for this
[1:09:52] tabernacle. I die to give back what get
[1:09:58] back the body where it's supposed to be.
[1:10:02] Then the next fellow comes and say like
[1:10:04] you know hey don't worry you know that
[1:10:07] really that thing about the church
[1:10:09] doesn't have really have any importance.
[1:10:12] I can use your body for fun.
[1:10:15] We just having fun, you know, we just
[1:10:17] exploring life
[1:10:20] really
[1:10:23] the tabernacle
[1:10:25] very good that the Lord has set in place
[1:10:30] and most of the time some of us when we
[1:10:33] are going to go through all those
[1:10:35] experiences of having fun and and trying
[1:10:38] to move left and right there's a voice
[1:10:41] in your heart telling you don't do
[1:10:45] sir. Amen. But because of the lust of
[1:10:49] life,
[1:10:51] the lust of the
[1:10:53] eyes, there we are. We try to cling on
[1:10:56] to
[1:11:02] it. And listen to brother
[1:11:05] Broner. And I have an idea why this
[1:11:07] tabernacle had to be kept the way they
[1:11:10] supposed to be
[1:11:12] clean. I may not be right on this, but
[1:11:15] he was right on it. I think that God was
[1:11:19] pre preserving this for his people that
[1:11:24] they might benefit by it. Amen. The
[1:11:28] body. Yes.
[1:11:33] We can go into interpretation. No, no,
[1:11:35] no, no, brother. It's not the body. It's
[1:11:37] only the the spirit. It's the ministry.
[1:11:40] No, that's not what the angel is saying.
[1:11:44] The angel say, "Defile not your body."
[1:11:49] And it has to go and this principle has
[1:11:52] to go throughout the scriptures.
[1:11:55] The mathematics has to be right. Right.
[1:11:59] If it start in Genesis, it has to go all
[1:12:02] the way into Revelation. Amen.
[1:12:05] And if it is from Genesis to Revelation,
[1:12:08] it will leave from 47 to 65. Yes, sir.
[1:12:14] And by God's grace that we saying that
[1:12:17] this outer tabernacle or this outer
[1:12:20] court, it has to be kept. It said like
[1:12:23] you know that they might benefit for it.
[1:12:25] I could figure no other way because by
[1:12:28] nature I was the other way, right?
[1:12:33] He was also attracted like anybody else
[1:12:38] to have a girlfriend which he did
[1:12:41] and went around and tried to drink,
[1:12:45] try to smoke
[1:12:48] the things that we inherited from our
[1:12:50] parents, right? The spirit of our
[1:12:54] nations
[1:12:55] or all our cultures was pushing him.
[1:12:59] Amen. Because he was a nourishment.
[1:13:04] He was taken into drinking. The Brhams
[1:13:06] were like that.
[1:13:09] Everybody in the country knows like, you
[1:13:10] know, hey, what's going on with you?
[1:13:13] Can't you drink
[1:13:15] in
[1:13:16] 2025? You don't have a girlfriend?
[1:13:21] What's wrong with you? Right?
[1:13:25] Then they start questioning how come
[1:13:27] your body doesn't behave like the rest
[1:13:30] of the bodies behave.
[1:13:34] Come on. Yes sir. He says no. It was not
[1:13:36] me. It was Christ.
[1:13:40] It was somebody from inside.
[1:13:43] Pulling all those five senses into
[1:13:46] subjection.
[1:13:48] And as he was sitting, he was looking.
[1:13:50] He said like, you know, it could only be
[1:13:53] him
[1:13:54] because he wanted a body in order to
[1:13:58] have a ministry so that the people can
[1:14:01] benefit from it. And as the people were
[1:14:04] benefiting from it, then he said like,
[1:14:06] you know, hey, because by nature I was
[1:14:09] the other way,
[1:14:11] because he said to the girlfriend, give
[1:14:13] me that cigarette. I'll prove to you.
[1:14:16] Many times we are pulled under the same
[1:14:18] pressure.
[1:14:20] I'll show you that I can also talk.
[1:14:25] I'll show you I'm also strong.
[1:14:29] But then he's showing
[1:14:32] us that these experiences that he's
[1:14:36] having is having these experiences as
[1:14:39] the wave she
[1:14:41] has the first one among us. Amen. that
[1:14:44] the Lord is coming onto and to reveal
[1:14:48] how to build the tabernacle
[1:14:51] from birth all the way to the end that
[1:14:55] this has to come to adoption sometime
[1:14:59] because when the sword came in it was
[1:15:02] not a spiritual
[1:15:06] sword and when the sword came in he held
[1:15:10] it to say like you know in this hand in
[1:15:13] this
[1:15:16] But then the whole process didn't start
[1:15:18] there at that time but it started all
[1:15:21] the way from birth. Amen. Amen. Drink
[1:15:24] not.
[1:15:26] Smoke not. Amen. Don't wear
[1:15:31] silk. Don't put all extra makeup.
[1:15:35] Don't do all these things here
[1:15:38] because there's a
[1:15:41] body being prepared
[1:15:44] for a specific work so people can
[1:15:47] benefit from it.
[1:15:50] No brother, I can add this here. I can
[1:15:52] wear whatever I want. It's like
[1:15:54] according to what pattern is that?
[1:15:57] According to what scripture is that?
[1:16:01] according show it to me from Genesis to
[1:16:04] Revelation. Amen. Show it in the Bible.
[1:16:10] Or we just taking a portion of the
[1:16:12] scripture and we start running with it
[1:16:15] and we leave the rest of the scripture
[1:16:19] because then something is wrong inside.
[1:16:24] And we'll get to that by God's grace.
[1:16:28] Matthew
[1:16:29] 10
[1:16:31] 28 and and and he's showing the Bible is
[1:16:35] showing us the same thing. And fear not
[1:16:37] them which kill the
[1:16:40] body, but are not able to kill the
[1:16:43] soul, but rather fear him which is able
[1:16:47] to destroy both soul and body in hell.
[1:16:52] Amen.
[1:16:54] This tabernacle that is given unto us
[1:16:57] as we seeing accidents all over the
[1:17:00] globe and people being killed in the
[1:17:02] soul in the in the spirit I mean in the
[1:17:05] body but the word is showing us is like
[1:17:07] you know hey but just be careful that
[1:17:10] the decision that we are making that
[1:17:12] there's one that can kill both soul and
[1:17:14] body right
[1:17:17] because the way we are conducting that
[1:17:19] body that
[1:17:21] tabernacle then there will be a sentence
[1:17:24] given unto it in 1 Corinthians 3. We're
[1:17:29] running out of time. I'll go a little
[1:17:30] bit quicker.
[1:17:33] Know you not that ye are the temple of
[1:17:35] God? And that the spirit of God dwelleth
[1:17:38] in you? If any man defile the temple of
[1:17:42] God,
[1:17:44] him shall God destroy. For the temple of
[1:17:48] God, he is holy which temple ye are.
[1:17:52] Amen.
[1:17:55] They say like you know that temple that
[1:17:56] we are this
[1:17:59] tabernacle when we defiling it with
[1:18:02] diverse things left and right and
[1:18:05] putting all kind of chemicals on it and
[1:18:08] going and burning the with
[1:18:10] the hot iron and all these things and
[1:18:14] straightening it up and giving it a
[1:18:17] whole different posture than what God
[1:18:19] has given it according to the pattern.
[1:18:22] They said God said like you know
[1:18:25] hey be aware
[1:18:27] God will destroy it because why was he
[1:18:31] going to destroy it? It's just going to
[1:18:33] exist. He said no because I thought of
[1:18:36] it.
[1:18:38] I had a conception of
[1:18:41] it and I want that body to be exactly
[1:18:44] the way I have made it. Amen. It is my
[1:18:49] possession.
[1:18:51] I paid for the possession.
[1:18:54] It's not your possession.
[1:18:58] You belong to somebody. Amen. Somebody
[1:19:01] has taken the clay and made a shape.
[1:19:06] Short, big, tall, and slender. All that
[1:19:09] you want according to his own pleasure.
[1:19:14] And he's making the tabernacle for a
[1:19:17] specific purpose so people can benefit
[1:19:20] from it.
[1:19:22] Amen.
[1:19:25] Few examples of the things that are to
[1:19:28] be made aware of. He said Lev 19:28. You
[1:19:33] shall not make any cutings in your
[1:19:40] flesh for the for the dead. No print any
[1:19:43] marks upon you. I am the Lord. Amen.
[1:19:49] Amen.
[1:19:51] This is my body. I can do anything you
[1:19:54] No, no, no. There's no such a thing.
[1:19:56] That's right. Take the
[1:19:58] pattern from Genesis to
[1:20:01] Revelation. Defile it not. The day you
[1:20:04] eat, the day you die, and they ate and
[1:20:07] died.
[1:20:10] And it goes on gives more light. No
[1:20:13] cutings upon your flesh.
[1:20:16] In other words, you go on and you pierce
[1:20:19] your ears. You make some cutings so you
[1:20:22] can have all kind of things.
[1:20:27] You're showing that this tabernacle
[1:20:30] has to be kept as it's supposed to.
[1:20:33] Amen.
[1:20:34] I am the Lord.
[1:20:37] 1 Corinthians
[1:20:39] 3:16, "Know you not that you are the
[1:20:42] temple of God, and that the spirit of
[1:20:44] God dwelleth in you? If any man defiles
[1:20:47] his temple, God gather shall destroy,
[1:20:50] shall God destroy. For the temple of God
[1:20:52] is holy, which temple ye are, let no man
[1:20:56] deceive himself." Amen. If any man among
[1:21:00] you seemth to be wise in this world, let
[1:21:04] him be be let him become a fool that he
[1:21:08] may be wise. Amen. Amen. We are living
[1:21:13] in such a world. We go and we paint our
[1:21:16] hairs and we cut we uh we bob it and we
[1:21:21] cut a little bit here and uh we try to
[1:21:24] make it God given you a gray
[1:21:29] All these things that we go through in
[1:21:31] the changes of our
[1:21:33] bodies, God is looking at the stage of
[1:21:36] the
[1:21:38] tabernacle and he wants to be glorified
[1:21:40] in it. Amen.
[1:21:44] You were born with uh black
[1:21:47] hair, the next day you blonde and and
[1:21:51] the next day you redheaded and
[1:21:56] You have a mixture of black and red and
[1:21:59] green and and all kind of things. He
[1:22:03] said that's not the made. That's right.
[1:22:08] That's not what I created.
[1:22:11] We go
[1:22:13] and pierce and and print all kind of
[1:22:17] things. What is that for? Oh, it's for
[1:22:19] my liberty. Liberty.
[1:22:24] He said, "Be watchful.
[1:22:27] Make the
[1:22:28] tabernacle. Keep it as it is." So I have
[1:22:31] a work to do with it. What work? We
[1:22:34] shall see. The invisible union uh will
[1:22:37] go
[1:22:38] faster. Uh the invisible union of 78.
[1:22:44] The prophet is showing that this body
[1:22:46] that we are speaking
[1:22:48] about at times we sit and we say like
[1:22:51] you know that really doesn't have any
[1:22:53] great importance but let's read the
[1:22:55] prophet it says like you know if she
[1:22:57] would m them she will defied for she'll
[1:23:01] be defied for for lifetime no matter how
[1:23:04] much she is forgiven she can be
[1:23:07] justified I'll strike that in a little
[1:23:09] bit here got a scripture on that in a
[1:23:11] few in a few minutes she can be forgiven
[1:23:14] um for for for her defilement. Remember
[1:23:17] the body that was to be not to be
[1:23:19] defiled but she cannot be defi she
[1:23:22] cannot be justified in this life. It's
[1:23:24] always with
[1:23:26] her. Brother Brham is basically showing
[1:23:29] he said like you know hey I'm talking
[1:23:31] about the natural woman but keep in mind
[1:23:34] it's the church that I am speaking about
[1:23:37] that this woman was given three sacred
[1:23:39] virtue and this three sacred virtue has
[1:23:42] to be kept one of them was her body and
[1:23:45] now if in this body she was going to
[1:23:50] defile the body but I'm saying she can
[1:23:53] be
[1:23:54] forgiven just like any one of us. We go,
[1:23:57] we drink and we smoke and we do all kind
[1:24:00] of things, but regardless of us being
[1:24:04] forgiven,
[1:24:06] those marks remain upon us. Amen.
[1:24:11] True. Yes, sir.
[1:24:14] Scriptural.
[1:24:19] When he tried to go and tried to drink,
[1:24:22] he didn't think of the consequences.
[1:24:27] they will try to be on that when he went
[1:24:31] to South Africa and started following
[1:24:34] the denominations and they leading him
[1:24:36] and say like you know I came to Africa I
[1:24:37] was supposed to be preaching to to to
[1:24:39] the black people and
[1:24:41] things but then because he didn't listen
[1:24:44] to God's leadership they took him in all
[1:24:46] kind of places and stuff then the Lord
[1:24:49] came to him and said like you know hey
[1:24:51] you have the green light go but you'll
[1:24:53] pay for it right and how did He pay for
[1:24:56] it in his flesh,
[1:24:59] in his body,
[1:25:02] and all these examples are being given
[1:25:04] unto us.
[1:25:06] That regardless of the pressures that we
[1:25:09] are going through,
[1:25:12] you say like, you know, but I can only
[1:25:14] do this. Let's do this just one time. I
[1:25:17] hope you understand the language.
[1:25:21] I'm a young girl. Just do it one time.
[1:25:25] You know, I'll just like, you know, go
[1:25:28] smoke one time.
[1:25:30] I can guarantee you the day you do that,
[1:25:34] you'll be different and forever. Amen.
[1:25:37] Yes, God will forgive you.
[1:25:41] But the way you used to stand before God
[1:25:43] will be different.
[1:25:50] When you make that vow,
[1:25:54] When a Nazeria was giving the vow he has
[1:25:59] to keep himself from all liquor from all
[1:26:03] kind of things. Why? Because there was a
[1:26:07] specific work to be done. Amen. But the
[1:26:11] day Samson went into Delilah,
[1:26:15] that was it.
[1:26:19] He said like, you know, I'll just like,
[1:26:20] you know, get away with it. You know,
[1:26:22] you know, I'm used to this. You know,
[1:26:24] I'll keep lying. I'll keep lying. But
[1:26:27] says the devil is telling business and
[1:26:30] is very cunning. That's right. You think
[1:26:33] that, you know, it's just a hand over
[1:26:35] your
[1:26:36] shoulder. after the shoulder then it
[1:26:39] gets you somewhere else then somewhere
[1:26:42] else then somewhere else then says when
[1:26:46] she's small she can she'll be forgiven
[1:26:51] but can be justified
[1:26:55] the tabernacle
[1:26:57] that the Lord said I've preached a
[1:26:59] tabernacle in the wilderness for
[1:27:02] specific purpose why people had to come
[1:27:05] to the tabernacle
[1:27:08] to offer
[1:27:10] sacrifices all the way in Genesis.
[1:27:13] Behold, the tabernacle of gods and men
[1:27:16] and all the kings of the earth had to
[1:27:19] come and bring all the offerings and the
[1:27:22] glory to the tabernacle. I'm jumping
[1:27:24] ahead, but I'll uh
[1:27:29] she may be she may be forgiven, but not
[1:27:32] but not justified.
[1:27:34] 79 Her body is given to her, a sacred
[1:27:38] trust from
[1:27:39] God. No female, dog, no bird or other
[1:27:45] animal, no other creature like that. No,
[1:27:49] she is the only
[1:27:51] one. Listen to this. Why is this
[1:27:55] tabernacle so important to be kept as a
[1:27:58] sacred virtue? a sacred ver sacred verse
[1:28:02] uh vessel. It says the reason it's so
[1:28:06] sacred, she is to bring forth life into
[1:28:10] the earth.
[1:28:15] When you shall grow, there will be a
[1:28:18] work for you to do.
[1:28:20] In the nature, our mothers, they have to
[1:28:24] bring forth life.
[1:28:26] But also in us also we are the
[1:28:31] tabernacle the temple in which God has
[1:28:34] to come and dwell. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:38] But then if that tabernacle like
[1:28:40] Nebuchadnezzar he came into the temple
[1:28:42] of God took all the vessels of God
[1:28:45] brought into his parties doing all all
[1:28:48] kind of things. Then God said, "You come
[1:28:50] into my
[1:28:51] tabernacle, you take all my
[1:28:54] utensils, you make you bring it to the
[1:28:57] feast of your God."
[1:29:04] We take the body of God, we go into the
[1:29:06] stadiums and we bring into all kind of
[1:29:09] atmospheres and we go and we find all
[1:29:12] the quotations we want and in order to
[1:29:14] support that because we have a desire we
[1:29:19] want to satisfy.
[1:29:20] Amen. Then the Lord is looking at you
[1:29:24] and said, "Oh, you're taking my temple.
[1:29:29] I have spoken the word let it
[1:29:33] be. Brother says that you know those
[1:29:35] seeds came in according to that time. I
[1:29:39] chose that this tabernacle may come in
[1:29:41] Leo this year for me to gain the glory
[1:29:45] out of it and you take this tabernacle
[1:29:48] and you bring into the feast of the
[1:29:53] gods. I said,
[1:29:56] "Oh, so you are wise in this world.
[1:30:00] Become foolish so you can become wise."
[1:30:03] Yes, sir. These sacred
[1:30:06] virtues were not virtues to go about and
[1:30:09] and just like you know playing with it
[1:30:11] and you know as I the the the children
[1:30:15] of Aaron they come and they preach you
[1:30:17] any kind of things and you put it in
[1:30:19] your mind and and you before you know it
[1:30:21] you know oh really they didn't they told
[1:30:23] us you know it's not really a problem I
[1:30:26] can put all kind of hair
[1:30:32] where's the pattern
[1:30:34] Right?
[1:30:36] How you building the
[1:30:38] tabernacle? How you covering the body
[1:30:40] that God has given us?
[1:30:43] According
[1:30:45] to pastor such and
[1:30:48] such because many of them the children
[1:30:51] of
[1:30:52] Eli sleeping at the door of the
[1:30:54] tabernacles.
[1:30:56] What were they
[1:30:57] doing? The way of
[1:31:00] behaving, the way of addressing the
[1:31:03] woman, they had a specific
[1:31:07] purpose. Many times people will go some
[1:31:11] places like we see we see in the fashion
[1:31:14] world. You come in as a young beautiful
[1:31:18] woman or handsome man, then they tell
[1:31:21] you, "No, no, no, no, no. That body of
[1:31:23] yours, we don't want it like
[1:31:25] that. Dress this way."
[1:31:28] reveal this this year. Put this here.
[1:31:31] You need to eat
[1:31:32] here. All for what purpose? For their
[1:31:36] own pleasures. That's right.
[1:31:39] But this tabernacle, God has created it.
[1:31:43] The devil took it and perverted it.
[1:31:45] Amen. And we are here and we just say
[1:31:49] like, you know, let's go along. No.
[1:31:52] We ought to be very cautious. Amen. We
[1:31:55] are to be made aware
[1:31:58] of the things that we are putting in our
[1:32:00] bodies. Amen. The way we are handling
[1:32:04] the tabernacle that God has given us.
[1:32:08] If in the food that we eat because the
[1:32:10] food that given to us as we see in the
[1:32:15] food industry they take all kind of
[1:32:17] things chemicals they play with it and
[1:32:20] before you know it you were very strict.
[1:32:22] You eat the food and you become very
[1:32:24] relaxed and you unable to stand with the
[1:32:26] word you be all that they are
[1:32:29] manipulating that's right the world
[1:32:32] today so that they can confirmed all of
[1:32:34] us
[1:32:39] those of you our parents who are
[1:32:41] here years sometimes the dressing that
[1:32:45] you see in the world today you could not
[1:32:48] imagine
[1:32:49] that amen Yes, true brother. But today
[1:32:52] it becomes a normal thing. You know the
[1:32:55] she comes to church. Forgive me I have
[1:32:58] to say it all her underwear showing
[1:33:01] up. But what's going on?
[1:33:08] God has given you that tabernacle.
[1:33:13] You defile it.
[1:33:16] said, "Many of you will go in that day
[1:33:18] of the judgment. I never I never I never
[1:33:21] committed adultery. I
[1:33:23] never cheated on my husband." But then
[1:33:26] you see a whole line of people coming. I
[1:33:29] committed adultery with you. How? The
[1:33:32] way we dressed. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:38] You are sitting on the on the pews and
[1:33:45] the tabernacle. Yeah.
[1:33:48] He says that you know make of it the of
[1:33:50] certain curtains.
[1:33:53] You sit outside you cannot see inside.
[1:33:56] Right.
[1:33:59] When you are dressing men and women
[1:34:02] everybody you have to make sure
[1:34:08] otherwise you'll be just like woman
[1:34:09] women. No no no no no. Because also
[1:34:11] today
[1:34:13] men pants are tying up and you say where
[1:34:17] are we going?
[1:34:22] Is this still the same tabernacle that
[1:34:24] God wants to have it covered up?
[1:34:27] If God wanted that such a liberty, he
[1:34:30] should have done it in the in the Bible.
[1:34:33] He should have done it in the Bible. He
[1:34:35] said like, you know, no, no, no. You
[1:34:36] don't need the curtains. just have uh
[1:34:38] anybody from the Egyptians they can see
[1:34:41] all the way into the Holy of Holies.
[1:34:47] But he said covered it up. Amen.
[1:34:51] So they can be twinned so they can
[1:34:54] support each other.
[1:34:58] In the question and answers I didn't I
[1:35:00] don't have the quote here but says that
[1:35:02] you know God has given some of us
[1:35:03] certain forms. You can't help it but we
[1:35:06] can cover it up. Right.
[1:35:12] At times we bring in all kind of spirit.
[1:35:15] We go to the gym, we we become all
[1:35:17] muscular and then you start coming to
[1:35:20] church and showing all your muscles.
[1:35:22] What spirit is behind? Amen.
[1:35:27] Then it's no more to give God the glory.
[1:35:29] There's another purpose behind. That's
[1:35:31] right. Amen. Then she start looking like
[1:35:34] Uh oh. What a type of brothers you like.
[1:35:38] I like you know he has to be strong. How
[1:35:40] do you how how did she come about to
[1:35:43] know such and such brother he's
[1:35:48] strong? That's why I preached the other
[1:35:51] day the ministries
[1:35:54] of the sanctuary.
[1:35:58] We have all of us a ministry right that
[1:36:02] when we are
[1:36:03] working we have to understand what our
[1:36:07] is
[1:36:08] what are we bringing to the tabernacles
[1:36:11] of God right
[1:36:14] as I said even in the weddings we we we
[1:36:16] we come and we want to show all kind of
[1:36:18] dresses and high heels is no no no no no
[1:36:21] no
[1:36:22] no understand some of us are still weak
[1:36:29] Some of us are still growing up
[1:36:31] regardless of the age. True. As one
[1:36:34] would say like you know pastor forgive
[1:36:36] me. You know every time I see such a
[1:36:38] sister I'm always taken in the church.
[1:36:42] It's not out there.
[1:36:46] It's not out there. And we are to be
[1:36:48] aware that when we are con dealing the
[1:36:52] way we are dealing with this tabernacle
[1:36:54] that God has given us, we have to be
[1:36:57] cautious. Amen. Yes, sir. No, no, no,
[1:37:01] no. I'm just doing it for myself. Yes.
[1:37:03] Do it for yourself and you will pay the
[1:37:05] price.
[1:37:07] Be aware that there is one that can
[1:37:10] destroy that body and destroy your soul.
[1:37:14] That's right. That's right. Because if
[1:37:16] he has to come and dwell in the
[1:37:18] tabernacle of ours, if we have to
[1:37:21] receive the Holy Spirit in the soul, he
[1:37:24] has to dwell in the physical body.
[1:37:31] That secret trust was given to her
[1:37:33] because we have to bring forth life. We
[1:37:35] have to present the blood of Jesus
[1:37:37] Christ. Her body is the bedding ground
[1:37:40] of life.
[1:37:41] In the ground you can put all kinds of
[1:37:44] life.
[1:37:46] In the ground we can put all kinds of
[1:37:48] life.
[1:37:51] Mustard
[1:37:53] seed,
[1:37:55] oranges, weed,
[1:37:58] they are seeds. Amen.
[1:38:02] But then now when you preparing your
[1:38:04] ground, what are you putting in there?
[1:38:06] Right.
[1:38:09] I believe is brother uh uh Steven who
[1:38:12] preach about the the husband men. He has
[1:38:15] prepared his garden.
[1:38:18] Why is he preparing it? So that he can
[1:38:20] remove all kind of seeds and protect it
[1:38:23] from all kind of foes and all kind of
[1:38:26] things. Right.
[1:38:29] But then if he's working and working and
[1:38:31] working years after years, years after
[1:38:34] years, you're still cutting your hair,
[1:38:35] painting it, and painting the nails and
[1:38:38] stuff and giving it a clear base and all
[1:38:41] these things to fool them. Who are you
[1:38:42] fooling?
[1:38:45] Brother Brham say the Bible says, "Be
[1:38:48] not
[1:38:50] mocked. You shall reap what you're
[1:38:53] sowing." Amen.
[1:38:55] Today you have a clear base, your child
[1:38:57] will have a much darker and darker and
[1:38:59] darker and darker.
[1:39:02] Then when it turns into red, no, it's a
[1:39:05] normal thing. You know, you do it. I do
[1:39:07] it. I just did it in a different shade.
[1:39:10] So then what scripture are you going to
[1:39:12] have to differentiate between this shed
[1:39:14] is good, that shade is not good.
[1:39:17] Right? Preach it.
[1:39:21] So that principle applies to everything
[1:39:24] else that we have.
[1:39:27] Time is up. I should have I really
[1:39:30] really have some other things here. Can
[1:39:32] you give me five minutes? Amen. God's
[1:39:37] grace. For they have not uh in Nemiah 9,
[1:39:41] watch the cry now of the people after
[1:39:44] they have sinned like you know they have
[1:39:45] sinned from the Lord. For they have not
[1:39:48] served thee in their in their kingdom.
[1:39:51] And in thy great goodness thou that thou
[1:39:54] givest them, and enlarge and fat land
[1:39:57] which thou gavest before them, neither
[1:39:59] there neither turn they from the the
[1:40:02] wicked works. Behold, we are servants
[1:40:05] this day, and for the land that thou has
[1:40:08] thou
[1:40:09] gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit
[1:40:12] thereof, and the good thereof, behold,
[1:40:15] we are servants in
[1:40:19] it. in the temple that God has given
[1:40:22] you. Yeah. We become servants. A new a a
[1:40:27] new shoe has come forth. Your heart is
[1:40:29] pounding to go get it. A new car. You
[1:40:32] are your mind is unsettled.
[1:40:36] You become servant in the very land that
[1:40:39] God has given you. Amen.
[1:40:42] and it yielded much increase unto the
[1:40:45] kings whom whom thou has set over us
[1:40:49] because of our
[1:40:51] sins. Look at the industries around us.
[1:40:54] They make money after money, money after
[1:40:58] money and yourself you broke after broke
[1:41:00] and broke.
[1:41:03] Why? Because all your budget is always
[1:41:06] like what is the new hair color? What is
[1:41:08] the new extension? What is the new this?
[1:41:10] What is the new that?
[1:41:14] You become servant. That's right. The
[1:41:17] Bible is there.
[1:41:19] They cried. But he said, you know, he
[1:41:21] said because of our sins also they have
[1:41:23] dominion over our bodies
[1:41:31] and over our
[1:41:32] cattle at their pleasure.
[1:41:40] Yeah. They want us to look like you say,
[1:41:43] "Oh, this is the trend now." Yeah. This
[1:41:46] is the trend in the message. You know,
[1:41:48] you don't need to make it to cover that
[1:41:50] much. You know, you can just Yeah, it is
[1:41:52] the trend
[1:41:55] at their pleasure.
[1:41:58] We don't have a revelation.
[1:42:01] There's no Christ inside
[1:42:05] to keep the tabernacle pure
[1:42:08] because just like you know let's make oh
[1:42:10] it looks good you know people will like
[1:42:12] me like this
[1:42:14] at their pleasure. Amen. Servant under
[1:42:18] the
[1:42:19] dominions they control your bodies. He
[1:42:22] said no no no no make it a little bit
[1:42:24] tighter. You know when you walk you know
[1:42:26] it gives you a little bit of a Yeah.
[1:42:32] And says, "Look at the first generation.
[1:42:36] Look at what happens to the second,
[1:42:38] right? And all the way to the third,
[1:42:40] right?
[1:42:43] After all,
[1:42:45] the glory will leave.
[1:42:49] Then you come and say, "Lord Jesus, oh,
[1:42:52] you died for me. Died for you.
[1:42:56] Yeah. If I died for you, I've laid down
[1:43:00] the payment for your body. That's right.
[1:43:03] So that that body can be healed. So that
[1:43:06] body can be made ready for the
[1:43:09] resurrection. And the resurrection to
[1:43:11] the change of the body. Yes. You want to
[1:43:16] be young, follow God's program.
[1:43:21] Very good. That's the truth. because of
[1:43:24] this body that God has given us. Yes, it
[1:43:27] is made prepared for a redemption. Amen.
[1:43:31] Hallelujah. But bottom says, I'm not
[1:43:34] going to read it, but says that we have
[1:43:36] the earnest of what? Of our redemption,
[1:43:40] which is what? Divine healing.
[1:43:44] But then in that very body that God has
[1:43:47] given us, we go, we do anything with it.
[1:43:49] We go, we defile it, then we come to
[1:43:51] God. God, please can you can you fix it?
[1:43:57] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:44:00] Is watching. He said, I'm giving you the
[1:44:03] pattern. I'm giving us the tabernacle.
[1:44:09] And all the technologies that we have
[1:44:11] today, you have all prints on your body
[1:44:13] say you go and you remove it. said,
[1:44:15] "Lord, I know I have I have already
[1:44:18] defiled this body to this extent,
[1:44:22] but I'll do as much as I can. At least
[1:44:25] forgive me."
[1:44:28] Huh? Just as like in my marriage
[1:44:29] divorce, you say like, you know, I
[1:44:31] forgive you, but then teach your
[1:44:33] children
[1:44:35] not to do it.
[1:44:37] It's not just marriage and divorce.
[1:44:40] It's in that principle lines up in
[1:44:42] everything. That's why brother Bam says
[1:44:44] it runs through the scripture.
[1:44:49] This divine healing that he has given
[1:44:52] unto us saying that you have a bruise
[1:44:56] because his word said that you shall
[1:44:58] make no cutting in your flesh. It brings
[1:45:01] forth life in order to restore where was
[1:45:05] cut.
[1:45:08] And as is restoring our
[1:45:10] bodies, it's not just to walk around and
[1:45:14] do with it whatever we want, but he
[1:45:17] bringing the word in order to make us
[1:45:19] aware that this body that he has given
[1:45:22] us is for a specific purpose. Amen.
[1:45:26] Yes. True.
[1:45:29] That's why I say like you know we are
[1:45:30] used to when they preach anything about
[1:45:33] the body, the five senses and touch and
[1:45:35] smell. No, no, no, no. You already know
[1:45:38] that this body a tabernacle. Yes. To
[1:45:42] bring forth life. Yes. And at the time
[1:45:46] the child that could grew up, he said,
[1:45:48] "I'll turn my back to you so you can
[1:45:52] know." Where was he doing that in the
[1:45:55] body that he had told him when he was
[1:45:57] young? Do not defile it in any manner
[1:46:01] because that this work me revealing
[1:46:04] myself unto my children will be done in
[1:46:07] this body so that the people can benefit
[1:46:10] from it. Amen.
[1:46:14] And then when we have now our sisters in
[1:46:17] your point of view, the virtues that God
[1:46:20] has given you,
[1:46:23] the life that will come out of it, you
[1:46:25] cannot tell if it's a minister, if it's
[1:46:30] a minister's wife and all these things.
[1:46:33] Take that, take that whole
[1:46:36] program, work on it. Understand that you
[1:46:40] have God has given us all a ministry and
[1:46:44] that ministry he wants a body that is
[1:46:47] pure prepared for him to do the work.
[1:46:50] Amen. Very good. Don't walk around and
[1:46:54] they have dominion over your bodies and
[1:46:56] you come and you show us and no no we
[1:46:59] don't need that. That's the Lord's
[1:47:01] property. It's not our property. Right?
[1:47:04] True. Even to the married one. Brother
[1:47:06] Brham says like you know don't do the
[1:47:08] things that you do in the magazines
[1:47:10] because after all she's your sister.
[1:47:15] You see the
[1:47:16] pattern because once you see the pattern
[1:47:19] everything else on the other
[1:47:23] coat will be made clear to her
[1:47:27] naturally God has given you long hair.
[1:47:29] Keep it long. Yeah. That's why when he
[1:47:32] went beyond the curtain of time, he saw
[1:47:34] the perfect image of those theophanes.
[1:47:37] He said like, you know, they were
[1:47:39] dressed this way.
[1:47:41] They had a they were looking this way.
[1:47:44] But then when he
[1:47:46] saw the church coming about,
[1:47:52] have I done all this work for this?
[1:47:55] Can you imagine Jesus looking at you?
[1:47:57] Have I done all this to end up with
[1:47:59] this?
[1:48:03] The auto quote. Yes. It was not just the
[1:48:07] spiritual yet the art.
[1:48:10] He said that I I was able to touch them.
[1:48:14] I bit myself. Am I sleeping? No, you're
[1:48:16] not sleeping. It's a body. Amen.
[1:48:20] A tabernacle made for the Lord. Amen.
[1:48:24] Ready for service. Amen.
[1:48:26] And that's where we see in revelation
[1:48:29] brother says then when the body of Jesus
[1:48:31] Christ shall come back again
[1:48:35] into his own image he says like you know
[1:48:37] look up
[1:48:39] there do you see his eyes do you see his
[1:48:42] mouth do you see his
[1:48:45] being don't look at your body as
[1:48:47] something like you know hey you die and
[1:48:49] you you gone no no no no no there's a
[1:48:52] specific program that God has laid out.
[1:48:56] He wants to see all that progression as
[1:48:58] you are getting older all the wrinkles.
[1:49:01] He wants to see all those wrinkles as
[1:49:05] that we go we put all kind of feelings
[1:49:08] and after the feelings and then it turns
[1:49:10] into a cancer there's like you know say
[1:49:12] brothers have a prayer for me.
[1:49:16] The wisdom that God gives us has to keep
[1:49:20] us and make us aware.
[1:49:23] This is not to be hard on us,
[1:49:26] but it's to make us aware.
[1:49:29] If we defile that body, God is going to
[1:49:33] destroy us and not just destroy the
[1:49:36] body, but also destroy the soul.
[1:49:40] Because we'll see that, you know, if in
[1:49:42] there in the Holy of Holies, if it's not
[1:49:45] faith, it's doubt.
[1:49:48] And if there's doubt, there's no way for
[1:49:51] the soul to be true and the body to be
[1:49:54] wrong.
[1:49:57] Because uh he shall bring all your
[1:50:00] members into subjection. Yes, sir. The
[1:50:04] lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
[1:50:07] and the pride of life. Usually, that's
[1:50:09] what confront this body. I want to do
[1:50:11] this. I want to be like everybody else.
[1:50:14] In Revelation 10, we see a mighty angel
[1:50:17] come down and the angel comes down. It's
[1:50:20] not a it's not a spiritual
[1:50:24] being. It is a
[1:50:26] body because himself Jesus went through
[1:50:30] the same
[1:50:32] process. He kept his body pure. He could
[1:50:36] do anything like everybody
[1:50:39] else. But he said, "I sanctify myself
[1:50:44] for what?" For them. Amen.
[1:50:51] Jesus went through that. He learned
[1:50:54] obedience through the things he
[1:50:56] suffered. Amen. Are we going to suffer
[1:50:59] certain things? Yes. Are we going to
[1:51:01] forsake a little bit of a beauty for the
[1:51:03] sake of others? Yes. And if we don't
[1:51:06] understand that there's a reward behind
[1:51:09] that sacrifice, his body was
[1:51:12] resurrected, brought up to the heavens
[1:51:14] and sat on the right hand of the
[1:51:18] father. And that body didn't just stay
[1:51:21] there forever and then disappeared. And
[1:51:24] then that body come back around. It said
[1:51:26] like, you know, at first bar said, I was
[1:51:30] I just came back to pray for my father.
[1:51:33] I looked around and I saw somebody
[1:51:35] standing there 10 ft from where I was. I
[1:51:38] said like, "Who's this?" I say, "Hey,
[1:51:42] hey, is this a
[1:51:46] vision?" No, no, no, no. I'm still here.
[1:51:49] This is real. The wind is is a flowing
[1:51:52] on the is uh bidding his
[1:51:55] robe. He comes to him.
[1:51:58] Jesus, it was not a spirit.
[1:52:03] He said like you know the pitch of man
[1:52:06] is as close as it can gets to him. It's
[1:52:11] not as perfect but as close as it can
[1:52:14] gets to it. Amen.
[1:52:16] And he didn't just stop there.
[1:52:19] Revelation 10 said like you know I'll
[1:52:21] show you to the entire world. Amen. I'll
[1:52:24] show it to you first individually but
[1:52:27] now I'm showing it to the entire world.
[1:52:29] I said like, you know, hey, I didn't
[1:52:30] take the
[1:52:32] picture. The proof that he went through
[1:52:36] all that
[1:52:37] suffering, through all that
[1:52:40] obedience in order to be presented to
[1:52:43] the entire world. Amen. We have seen his
[1:52:47] beard. We've seen his
[1:52:51] eyes. That body of yours is not to be
[1:52:54] despised.
[1:52:56] is not to be looked down
[1:52:58] onto. You have something that is very
[1:53:02] important unto us. What do we do with
[1:53:04] it? We keep it. We treasure it. We clean
[1:53:08] it. We maintain it. But not after
[1:53:12] Babylon. May God bless you.
[1:53:19] Amen.
[1:53:25] Let's all stand together.
[1:53:37] Why would God be so specific
[1:53:44] and take the Old Testament and you make
[1:53:46] so many
[1:53:47] loops and you make the garment of this
[1:53:51] color and you put the
[1:53:54] edging. If he's showing that it is so
[1:53:57] specific on
[1:54:00] that temple of the
[1:54:02] Lord, then what about our bodies? Amen.
[1:54:08] Does it really matter? It does. It does.
[1:54:14] That's why Jezebel religion says it
[1:54:17] doesn't matter what you wear.
[1:54:21] Cut your hair.
[1:54:23] We should be so totally different by the
[1:54:27] way we look and the way we dress and the
[1:54:30] way we talk and the way we walk than
[1:54:32] normal Christianity. I'm sorry.
[1:54:39] because
[1:54:42] it's all for a purpose.
[1:54:45] [Music]
[1:54:47] And guess
[1:54:48] what? The reason he did it, he said,
[1:54:51] "It's for your benefit."
[1:54:54] [Music]
[1:54:56] Thank you, Lord. I appreciated that.
[1:54:59] That was
[1:55:01] very good tonight,
[1:55:04] Brother Martin. Thank you. Diversities
[1:55:07] of gifts,
[1:55:09] diversities of operations,
[1:55:13] he takes the drapes and the coverings
[1:55:17] and the curtains and the rods and the
[1:55:20] loops and everything. You wonder where
[1:55:22] are you? Brother Bram said, "If you
[1:55:24] can't read the scripture and see Christ
[1:55:27] in every verse,
[1:55:30] come on. It's for a purpose.
[1:55:34] It's all there. The numbers,
[1:55:37] I'll tell you how specific it is. If you
[1:55:41] had the very mind of Christ, you would
[1:55:44] know why there's 50
[1:55:47] loops. You would know why there are
[1:55:50] certain colors and why some of them are
[1:55:53] joined together and why others are
[1:55:55] separate.
[1:55:57] It's all for a purpose.
[1:56:01] Thank you, Lord. Yes. Let us have the
[1:56:04] mind of Christ.
[1:56:07] Amen. What's the name of this song?
[1:56:10] Keep me
[1:56:12] true,
[1:56:14] Lord
[1:56:16] Jesus.
[1:56:17] Keep me true.
[1:56:20] Let it be your desire.
[1:56:23] Oh, keep me
[1:56:26] true, my
[1:56:28] Lord Jesus.
[1:56:31] keep me to
[1:56:34] [Music]
[1:56:36] truth. Oh, there a
[1:56:40] race that I must
[1:56:44] run. There are
[1:56:47] victories to be won.
[1:56:52] Give me
[1:56:55] power
[1:56:56] every
[1:56:58] hour
[1:57:00] to be true. Brother Oliver, would you
[1:57:03] come up here and close in a word of
[1:57:05] prayer,
[1:57:07] please? Amen. That's our desire. Lord,
[1:57:10] keep me true. Amen. Let me be aware of
[1:57:13] this body, of this temple.
[1:57:17] If God was so particular on the Old
[1:57:19] Testament, on that tabernacle, will he
[1:57:22] not be particular on us now? Absolutely.
[1:57:27] God bless you, brother Oliver. Thank
[1:57:28] you. God bless you. Thank you for the
[1:57:31] opportunity. Let's pray, Leah, Lord
[1:57:34] Jesus Christ. What an opportunity to be
[1:57:36] here to hear your word. You speak
[1:57:38] straight to us, Lord.
[1:57:41] And this word Lord that will change us
[1:57:43] not to be conformed to this world but to
[1:57:44] be transformed by the renewing of our
[1:57:46] mind. Wow. We believe that you are the
[1:57:49] same yesterday, today and forever. You
[1:57:52] the only God never changed for the
[1:57:54] nature of God and we believe that Lord.
[1:57:56] After that Lord you think life will be
[1:57:58] confirmed to this word. This tabernacle
[1:58:01] Lord will keep it safe and true.
[1:58:02] Confirmed to the specific form is
[1:58:05] required. Lord after this will be going
[1:58:08] in different ways. Lord, we ask for your
[1:58:09] presence to be each and everyone. Amen.
[1:58:11] Until we meet again, in the name of the
[1:58:13] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen.
[1:58:17] Thank you, Lord.
[1:58:20] Amen. It was good to be in the house of
[1:58:22] the Lord. Amen. Learning a little bit
[1:58:26] more about our redemption and why it is
[1:58:29] the way that it is and why it's so
[1:58:32] specific. Thank you, Lord. You do it for
[1:58:35] our benefit. Turn around, shake
[1:58:36] somebody's hand, say, "God bless you."
[1:58:39] Consider yourselves dismissed. You may
[1:58:41] go in the presence of the Lord. God
[1:58:43] bless you.
