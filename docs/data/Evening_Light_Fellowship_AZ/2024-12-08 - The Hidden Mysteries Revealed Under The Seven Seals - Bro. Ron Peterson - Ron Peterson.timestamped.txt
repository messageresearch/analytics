[50:10] in the lovely name of Jesus Christ got
[50:13] some things in my heart this morning
[50:14] let's just remain standing go directly
[50:17] to the word go to Revelation chapter
[50:22] 17 Revelation chapter 17
[50:31] verses
[50:36] 1-6 and there came one of the Seven
[50:40] Angels which had the seven vials and
[50:43] talked with me saying unto me come
[50:47] hither I will show unto thee the
[50:49] Judgment of the great that sth
[50:52] upon many
[50:54] Waters with whom the kings of the Earth
[50:56] have have committed
[50:58] fornication and the inhabitants of the
[51:00] Earth have been made drunk with the wine
[51:03] of her
[51:05] fornication so he carried me away in the
[51:08] spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a
[51:11] woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast
[51:14] full of names of
[51:16] blasphemy having seven heads and 10
[51:19] horns and the woman was arrayed in
[51:22] purple and scarlet color and decked with
[51:25] gold and precious stones and Pearls
[51:29] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[51:33] Abominations and filthiness of her
[51:37] fornication and upon her forehead was a
[51:40] name written mystery Babylon the great
[51:44] the mother of harlots and Abominations
[51:46] of the earth and I saw the woman drunken
[51:50] with the blood of the Saints and with
[51:52] the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and
[51:55] when I saw her her I wondered with great
[52:00] admiration may God add the blessing of
[52:02] the reading of his word you may be
[52:04] seated this morning in his
[52:10] presence now we know that Revelation is
[52:13] a book of
[52:14] symbols you've got to understand those
[52:16] symbols or you don't understand the book
[52:19] you don't understand what the Lord is
[52:21] trying to
[52:23] say but here we have a m Myster and it's
[52:27] called mystery
[52:29] Babylon and
[52:32] um she is doing something which is going
[52:36] to have an
[52:38] effect upon
[52:41] everyone on the earth it affects us
[52:45] today it greatly affects everything and
[52:49] all everything that is around us and all
[52:53] of you need to be extremely aware of
[52:56] this yes
[52:58] lest those influences of
[53:02] Babylon creep and permeate right into
[53:05] your
[53:06] lives that was the sin of
[53:11] achen do you remember what he did he
[53:14] took Babylonian garments and wedges of
[53:17] silver and of gold and he put them into
[53:20] his his home thinking what I do in my
[53:22] home will not affect anyone else well
[53:27] when one member
[53:29] suffers the whole body
[53:31] suffers so we
[53:34] understand and we say who am I excuse me
[53:39] preacher's voice is always a little hard
[53:41] getting started so you just bear with me
[53:44] and if I have to clear my throat a time
[53:46] or two that's
[53:50] okay so we understand that these things
[53:55] are happening
[53:57] right here in America today the prophet
[53:59] of God said that I do not see any other
[54:03] country that so
[54:05] embolizes or the epitome of Babylon as
[54:09] what America does
[54:11] today so we see the Babylonian Kingdom
[54:15] that started that was the beginning of
[54:18] it and that Babylonian influence comes
[54:22] right on down into
[54:24] today I wish to read a couple more
[54:27] scriptures here before I elaborate on
[54:30] this and I'll give you my sermon title
[54:32] in a moment brother Mark second
[54:34] Thessalonians if you would 2
[54:37] Thessalonians chapter 2 and then we're
[54:40] going to read 2 Corinthians chapter
[54:44] 6 and so while brother Mark is turning
[54:47] to 2 Thessalonians
[54:49] 2 I want you to
[54:52] understand that um even when brother
[54:55] Brenham began to bring into the church
[54:58] the understanding of Holiness before the
[55:01] Lord and beg got he began to talk about
[55:04] how women dress and everything and the
[55:07] reason that he spoke on women was
[55:09] because women is a type of the church
[55:11] you want to see where they're at look at
[55:14] the women it will give you the
[55:18] reflection and so the prophet of God um
[55:22] was given all kinds of excuses from the
[55:25] different system who said well but
[55:28] that's all they have to sell out there
[55:30] and he said but they still sell sewing
[55:33] machines they still sell material where
[55:37] you can go and you can make your
[55:40] own and that's good again for today but
[55:42] I just hope that there are sisters that
[55:45] the mothers have taught their daughters
[55:46] how to sew or to sew on a
[55:49] button or to darn a
[55:54] sock there wasn't many amens on that and
[55:57] how to
[55:59] cook amen yeah you
[56:04] teach the younger women these things but
[56:07] I want to say this that this influence
[56:10] will come into the church and it
[56:13] will have an effect upon all of us and
[56:16] we need to be aware of it now let me
[56:19] give you an example Babylonian garments
[56:22] would be anything that is the fashion of
[56:25] the world immoral
[56:26] unclean
[56:28] or something that is not conducive to a
[56:32] Christian
[56:34] Life and if you wear
[56:38] that it's a defiant
[56:42] Spirit listen to me it is a defiant
[56:47] Spirit you say it doesn't really
[56:52] matter high heel shoes
[56:57] okay for you to wear high heel shoes and
[57:01] I hope nobody's wearing high heel shoes
[57:03] this
[57:04] morning you know I I do I'm not
[57:06] preaching at people I'm preaching at a
[57:09] spirit it's a spirit of
[57:14] Babylon and for you to wear
[57:19] those it's a spirit of defiance I don't
[57:23] care what the word says or what the
[57:26] prophet of the hour says I'm going to do
[57:29] my own
[57:31] thing God help us that we don't have
[57:34] ones within the church that over and
[57:37] over you preach the word of God and yet
[57:40] they like to go to the
[57:43] edge God help us 2 Thessalonians chapter
[57:47] 2 verses
[57:50] 1-4 now we beseech you Brethren by the
[57:52] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by
[57:55] our gathering together unto him that you
[57:57] be not soon shaken in mind or be
[58:00] troubled neither by Spirit nor by word
[58:03] nor by letter as from us as that the day
[58:05] of Christ is at hand let no man deceive
[58:08] you by any means let man no man deceive
[58:11] you by any means go ahead for that day
[58:15] shall not come except there come a
[58:17] falling away first that that day shall
[58:20] not
[58:21] come except there be a falling away
[58:24] first a falling falling away from
[58:27] what from the truth go ahead and that
[58:31] man of sin be revealed the son of
[58:33] predition who opposeth and exalteth
[58:36] himself above all that is called God or
[58:38] that is worshiped as that he as God sth
[58:41] in the temple of God showing himself
[58:43] that he is God isn't this exactly what
[58:46] the scriptures said that in Isaiah how
[58:49] oh Lucifer son of the morning how thou
[58:53] Hast lifted thyself up wanting to be
[58:56] worshiped as God taking away from what
[59:00] God's word is this is our absolute this
[59:04] is this is our Plum
[59:06] Line This is where if we need an answer
[59:10] on anything it's
[59:14] here so if anyone adds to and takes away
[59:17] from the word of God the Bible says that
[59:20] let their name be stricken from The Book
[59:23] of Life and the plagues found
[59:26] upon them that would do that so we see
[59:30] that this one is so
[59:32] deceptive but the Bible says that the
[59:34] man of sin would be revealed the son of
[59:38] predition because he opposes
[59:41] everything that is called God or wants
[59:44] to be raised above
[59:47] God and he wants to be
[59:50] worshiped do you realize that everyone
[59:53] out
[59:54] there is worship shipping a
[59:59] God in their football
[1:00:02] stadiums basketball
[1:00:05] Arenas in their rock and roll Arenas
[1:00:08] everywhere they have their
[1:00:10] gods they have their movie star gods
[1:00:14] they have their gods of all kinds of
[1:00:18] things everyone wants to be worship
[1:00:20] everybody wants to be on Facebook
[1:00:23] Instagram It's All About Me look at me
[1:00:26] this is me this is what I do look at
[1:00:28] what I can
[1:00:29] do so opposite of the things of God
[1:00:33] himself for there was no Beauty in him
[1:00:35] that we should desire him there was
[1:00:38] nothing about his
[1:00:40] clothing that made him stand out in fact
[1:00:45] they once tried to take him to Stone him
[1:00:50] or to take him away and guess what he
[1:00:52] walked among the crowd and they couldn't
[1:00:55] find him
[1:00:57] oh yeah that guy in a real fancy suit
[1:00:59] with a real uh hat you know and the
[1:01:03] the no that there was no Beauty in
[1:01:07] him my brother my
[1:01:10] sister we see how this Babylon is
[1:01:15] penetrating right on down into the
[1:01:18] Realms of this very hour in which we
[1:01:21] live you can see it in the media in our
[1:01:24] newspapers and in our
[1:01:27] televisions and we're going to see
[1:01:29] throughout the course of this sermon how
[1:01:33] the God of this world have has turned
[1:01:37] them over to a reprobate mind that they
[1:01:40] would believe a lie and what be damned
[1:01:46] all right brother Mark 2 Corinthians
[1:01:49] chapter 6
[1:01:52] sorry 2 Corinthians chapter 6
[1:01:56] and verses 14-
[1:02:04] 18 Allelujah it helps if I get second
[1:02:08] Corinthians not first yeah second

[1:02:21] 18 be not unequally yolked together with
[1:02:25] unbelievers for what Fellowship hath
[1:02:27] righteousness with unrighteousness now
[1:02:29] wait a second here the Bible says be not
[1:02:32] unequally yolked
[1:02:34] with
[1:02:36] unbelievers for what Fellowship hath
[1:02:39] righteousness with unrighteousness go it
[1:02:43] for what Fellowship hath righteousness
[1:02:44] with unrighteousness and what communion
[1:02:47] hath light with
[1:02:48] darkness and what Concord hath Christ
[1:02:51] with bile or what part hath he that
[1:02:54] believeth with an infidel
[1:02:56] and what agreement hath the temple of
[1:02:58] God with Idols for ye are the Temple of
[1:03:00] the Living God as God hath said I will
[1:03:03] dwell in them and walk in them and I
[1:03:05] will be their God and they shall be my
[1:03:07] people wherefore come out from among
[1:03:09] them and be ye separate sayeth the Lord
[1:03:11] and touch not the unclean
[1:03:13] thing and I will receive you and will be
[1:03:16] a father unto you and you shall be my
[1:03:18] sons and daughters sayith the Lord
[1:03:20] Almighty do you understand he's saying
[1:03:23] what what what agreement do you have
[1:03:25] with the Devil or unbelievers or
[1:03:28] infidels what do you have in common is
[1:03:30] there anything who you hang around with
[1:03:33] shows me your Revelation you hang around
[1:03:37] those of the world who act like the
[1:03:39] world talk like the world live like the
[1:03:43] world the love of God is not even in
[1:03:45] them come on now help me preach this
[1:03:47] morning I don't want you to sit there
[1:03:49] and be silent I want you to be able to
[1:03:52] say Amen to the word of God Amen because
[1:03:56] we're in a very dark hour and darkness
[1:03:58] is covering the people gross Darkness
[1:04:02] they don't know what gender they
[1:04:04] are they don't know their position thank
[1:04:07] God that we have brothers and sisters
[1:04:09] and men and women in this hour who know
[1:04:13] where they come from where they're going
[1:04:15] they know their gender they know their
[1:04:17] position Hallelujah the others have got
[1:04:20] such a reprobate mind they don't
[1:04:24] know amen
[1:04:29] I'm titling my sermon this
[1:04:32] morning the Hidden Mysteries revealed
[1:04:35] under the Seven
[1:04:36] Seals the Hidden Mysteries these are
[1:04:40] Mysteries that were not open until this
[1:04:44] hour others probed at it others preached
[1:04:48] about it but it was the seventh angel
[1:04:52] amen amen who was given the revelation
[1:04:55] of the Seven Seals and I saw a white
[1:04:59] horse and a man riding on upon it and a
[1:05:03] he had in his hand a bow with no
[1:05:06] arrows and he went righty I want you to
[1:05:09] understand these are symbols but what
[1:05:13] was it it's a spirit and it went
[1:05:17] righty do you realize my brother my
[1:05:20] sister that we are we are living in the
[1:05:23] darkest most deceiving power that has
[1:05:26] ever been upon the face of the
[1:05:31] Earth the Hidden Mysteries revealed
[1:05:34] under the Seven
[1:05:36] Seals I'd like to take a subject of
[1:05:40] showing a parallel between the mystery
[1:05:42] of Christ because we got
[1:05:45] Mysteries we got a mystery
[1:05:48] woman we've got a mystery of a woman
[1:05:51] who's coming to
[1:05:52] power she is amen who is it it's the
[1:05:56] bride of Christ she's coming into her
[1:05:59] position but also there's another one
[1:06:03] rising up that's going to fight
[1:06:07] her you have the mystery of
[1:06:12] Christ and you have the mystery of
[1:06:15] Babylon and I want you to understand
[1:06:18] that these two kingdoms are in
[1:06:21] Conflict it is the greatest battle ever
[1:06:23] being fought right now that's right and
[1:06:27] you are in the midst of this great
[1:06:30] conflict the Kingdom of Heaven and the
[1:06:33] kingdom of the
[1:06:37] devil watch these two Vines the prophet
[1:06:41] said that started there in
[1:06:44] Genesis Cain
[1:06:47] Abel Esau and
[1:06:50] Jacob Jesus and
[1:06:54] Judas and here we are in this
[1:07:00] 2024 and we have
[1:07:03] another day like in under the time of
[1:07:07] Babylon did you know that Saddam
[1:07:11] Hussein did you know that he told
[1:07:14] everybody and was not silent about it
[1:07:17] that he believed he had the spirit or
[1:07:19] The Reincarnation of Nebuchadnezzar
[1:07:28] do you realize Osama Bin
[1:07:31] Laden said I want to destroy
[1:07:34] Israel and anyone that supports them why
[1:07:38] did we have the 911
[1:07:44] attack because of our support to
[1:07:51] Israel and this Hamas and PLO
[1:07:56] an anti-Semitism that is happening in
[1:07:58] the world today right now upon our
[1:08:01] college
[1:08:02] campuses they are allowing them to to
[1:08:07] teach our college
[1:08:09] students how to go ahead and how to uh
[1:08:14] uh reject and go against and fight
[1:08:17] anyone who claims to be a
[1:08:21] Jew
[1:08:23] my from Palestine into the
[1:08:27] sea they do not want to live
[1:08:32] peaceably these are the sons of
[1:08:36] ishmail against Isaac yes they are the
[1:08:39] Seed of Abraham that's true through
[1:08:42] Hagar and if you know your Bible ishmail
[1:08:47] hated
[1:08:48] Isaac he made fun of
[1:08:53] him my
[1:08:56] in the sermon God identifying himself by
[1:08:58] his
[1:08:59] characteristics the spirit of God can be
[1:09:02] identified by its
[1:09:05] characteristics see the spirit of God
[1:09:07] and the spirit of the church there's a
[1:09:10] church
[1:09:11] Spirit and the spirit of God that's
[1:09:14] absolutely not like the church Spirit at
[1:09:17] all amen there's a denominational spirit
[1:09:22] and there's a national spirit and he
[1:09:24] goes on I want you to understand I'm not
[1:09:26] talking about a just having a church or
[1:09:31] religious spirit anyone can do that
[1:09:34] anyone can change their Church they can
[1:09:37] change their Doctrine they can change
[1:09:40] the way they live but it takes God to
[1:09:43] change a heart I'm talking about a
[1:09:46] relationship with Jesus Christ that
[1:09:49] makes you a 21st century disciple that

[1:20:53] able to make war with him and there was
[1:20:56] given unto him a mouth speaking great
[1:20:59] things and

[1:21:04] to continue 40 and two months how long
[1:21:07] is that three and a half years look at
[1:21:11] this and he opened his mouth and
[1:21:14] blasphemy against

[1:21:21] his Tabernacle and him and them
[1:21:25] that dwell in heaven and it was given
[1:21:28] unto him to make war with the Saints and
[1:21:31] to overcome them and power was given him
[1:21:35] over all kindreds and tongues and
[1:21:38] Nations and all that dwell upon the
[1:21:41] Earth shall worship
[1:21:43] Him whose names are not written in the
[1:21:48] Book of Life of the lamb slain from the

[1:22:18] workers of iniquity I never knew you in
[1:22:21] vain do you worship me

[1:22:28] system has permeated right down into the
[1:22:32] whole christiandom and got everybody all

[1:24:48] said God help us huh
[1:24:52] amen worship
[1:24:55] in vain do they wor our worship is
[1:24:58] different why because Jesus said if you

[1:25:46] every everybody loves to go to a
[1:25:47] pageantry huh come on man they got a
[1:25:50] Christmas thing over here and the
[1:25:52] largest church in Phoenix and they got
[1:25:54] camels and cows and sheep and everything
[1:25:56] and let's go be
[1:25:59] entertained people want to be
[1:26:02] entertained God help us I'm I I'm not
[1:26:04] against it I've gone to it when I got
[1:26:07] done I wasn't any closer to
[1:26:09] God than when I went in fact I thought
[1:26:13] look at all the money they
[1:26:19] spent I I I just say this one time there
[1:26:23] was a guy and they had an angel come you
[1:26:26] know it was Michael the Archangel or
[1:26:28] somebody coming on a Highwire coming
[1:26:31] over the people and here he come in and
[1:26:33] here comes the angel and he got about
[1:26:35] halfway and the the the cable got stuck
[1:26:39] and then he starts spinning and he's got
[1:26:42] a microphone on him and he starts
[1:26:43] turning the air blue man he's cussing
[1:27:00] listen I'm not against those
[1:27:02] sa in this sense in this sense other
[1:27:06] than the fact I know that my worship is
[1:27:10] different I know my worship is because
[1:27:13] of the Revelation I have within my heart
[1:27:16] and because of the life that I
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:19] live because my life is not a religion
[1:27:22] it's a relationship
[1:27:25] and therefore there can be all kinds of
[1:27:26] people with their cut hair and their
[1:27:28] makeup and their immoral clothing and
[1:27:30] you know what they just are like Cain
[1:27:34] who says I'm going to offer what I want
[1:27:36] to offer and if God doesn't like
[1:27:39] it and then when his offering was not
[1:27:42] received what did he do he got mad with
[1:27:45] God how many people today religious
[1:27:48] people well God take it or or or leave
[1:27:52] it right
[1:27:58] God help us to have a
[1:28:00] heart that is pure before God and a life
[1:28:04] that's living Justified and Sanctified
[1:28:07] and then filled with the holy spirit
[1:28:13] amen John 4 verse 21 and 20 through 24
[1:28:18] Jesus saith unto her
[1:28:21] woman believe me the hour
[1:28:24] cometh when they shall neither in this
[1:28:27] mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship
[1:28:30] the
[1:28:33] father but the hour cometh and now is
[1:28:37] when the true worshippers shall worship
[1:28:39] the father in spirit and in truth for
[1:28:42] the father seeketh such to worship him
[1:28:47] God is a spirit and they that worship
[1:28:50] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[1:28:54] truth
[1:28:56] am I'm not saying others are not
[1:28:58] worshiping they are but not in
[1:29:04] truth they don't even know as Jesus said
[1:29:07] you know not who you
[1:29:10] worship but we know who we worship
[1:29:16] am they have a religions that's not
[1:29:19] based on a life Justified and Sanctified
[1:29:22] they worship a god of compromise in
[1:29:25] Creeds and
[1:29:28] dogmas it's
[1:29:31] true many of them I've heard

[1:33:15] meat I thought what are you talking
[1:33:21] about so I began to read a little little
[1:33:29] more and somebody else said amen
[1:33:33] hallelujah isn't that
[1:33:36] wonderful and brother Sergio it made me
[1:33:39] feel so
[1:33:40] bad because I didn't see
[1:33:45] it I didn't see it they're all excited
[1:33:49] they're they're saying hallelujah on
[1:33:51] what brother Abel tell me on what what
[1:33:54] why do you say Amen to that for what
[1:33:56] reason why do you get excited why why do
[1:34:00] people sometimes while the ministers
[1:34:02] preaching somebody said Amen brother
[1:34:04] preach that that's the
[1:34:06] truth
[1:34:12] why I'll tell you why it's called
[1:34:17] representation of the seed inside of you
[1:34:22] amen because my words that I speak Jesus
[1:34:25] said are what they are spirit and
[1:34:31] life so when the word of God is spoken
[1:34:34] to you not in a Creed not in a Dogma but
[1:34:39] right there from the Bible when you read
[1:34:41] it don't try to interpret it say what he
[1:34:46] said it'll change your
[1:34:48] life it did mine amen I will remember
[1:34:53] that when I gave my heart to the Lord
[1:34:56] Jesus I I didn't know what I was
[1:34:59] doing Ezra I got so
[1:35:03] excited I got
[1:35:05] so
[1:35:07] excited I went
[1:35:09] outside the power lines are 30 40 feet
[1:35:13] in the air going down the driveway along
[1:35:16] the road and we were shouting and
[1:35:20] jumping I said I feel like I could reach
[1:35:22] up and touch those
[1:35:24] power I just felt so
[1:35:29] free because Jesus said You shall know
[1:35:32] the truth and the truth shall set you
[1:35:36] free nothing else religion won't do it
[1:35:39] truth will do it and when you hear the
[1:35:41] truth amen then when I came to this
[1:35:46] message the whole Enlightenment of the
[1:35:48] whole
[1:35:49] Bible my Bible became a new Bible
[1:35:55] I knew that he was not three Gods it
[1:35:58] wasn't father son Holy Ghost it was Lord
[1:36:01] Jesus Christ I found out there's one
[1:36:04] mediator between God and man that's the
[1:36:06] man Christ Jesus I found out the way of
[1:36:09] true water baptism wasn't Father Son and
[1:36:11] Holy Ghost no one in the Bible ever
[1:36:14] baptized Father Son and Holy
[1:36:17] Ghost how are they baptized Acts 2:38
[1:36:20] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:36:22] Jesus Christ
[1:36:24] what is the name of the father is Father
[1:36:27] a name is son a name is Holy Ghost the
[1:36:32] name no what is the name there's one
[1:36:35] name given among men whereby we must be
[1:36:38] saved Lord Jesus Christ so Peter on the
[1:36:41] day of Pentecost
[1:36:43] you who have taken this one called Jesus
[1:36:47] the Christ and have crucified
[1:36:50] him the same one God hath raised him up
[1:36:54] and made him Lord and
[1:36:58] Christ but his name was Jesus what was
[1:37:01] it
[1:37:01] Lord Jesus
[1:37:05] Christ
[1:37:16] Hallelujah in in the sermon the first

[1:42:46] two
[1:42:47] Powers the mystery of Christ in his
[1:42:52] bride a church rising up we talk about a
[1:42:56] woke

[1:43:01] with their multicolored hair their
[1:43:03] tattoos

[1:43:11] of your father you'll look like him
[1:43:14] you'll do do like
[1:43:15] him and it's getting
[1:43:19] weird but there's another generation

[1:43:26] angel about the Midnight
[1:43:31] Hour and guess what both wise and
[1:43:34] foolish woke up behold the bridegroom
[1:43:41] coming so we have also our woke
[1:43:45] generation thank God when you listen to
[1:43:48] the
[1:43:49] teams and you hear this Prophet you know
[1:43:52] what he's doing he's waking you
[1:43:55] up
[1:43:58] amen now brother James preached a
[1:44:01] tremendous service this past
[1:44:04] Wednesday I enjoyed
[1:44:08] that but with all of your wisdom that
[1:44:10] you're getting get understanding so
[1:44:13] we're going to look at one more
[1:44:14] scripture here I'd like brother Mark if
[1:44:16] you would we're going to go to 1
[1:44:17] Corinthians chapter 2 verses 1-14
[1:44:24] 1 Corinthians 2 veres
[1:44:26] 1-14 you guys bear with me now for just
[1:44:29] a few more
[1:44:31] minutes
[1:44:35] yeah 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse one
[1:44:38] if you would brother
[1:44:42] Mark and I Brethren when I came to you
[1:44:45] came not with Excellency of speech or of
[1:44:47] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[1:44:50] of
[1:44:51] God for I determined not to know
[1:44:53] anything among you save Jesus Christ and
[1:44:56] him
[1:44:57] crucified and I was with you in weakness
[1:44:59] and in fear and in much trembling and my
[1:45:02] speech and my preaching was not with
[1:45:05] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[1:45:07] demonstration of the spirit and of power
[1:45:10] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:45:12] wisdom of men but in the power of God
[1:45:15] you see the difference not with enticing
[1:45:17] words of man's
[1:45:19] Wisdom Paul is giving you an example hey
[1:45:22] I come to use hear in weakness and fear
[1:45:25] and trembling Paul the first church age
[1:45:29] messenger
[1:45:31] wow look at that go ahead how be it we
[1:45:35] speak wisdom among them that are perfect
[1:45:37] yet not the wisdom of this world nor of
[1:45:39] the princes of this world that come to
[1:45:42] not but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[1:45:44] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[1:45:47] ordained before the world unto our Glory
[1:45:49] the hidden wisdom which God ordained
[1:45:54] before the world unto our Glory hidden
[1:45:59] wisdom something that is hidden in
[1:46:02] Scripture that though others read it
[1:46:04] they don't see it for the parable
[1:46:07] is there are many that have eyes to see
[1:46:10] but they see not they have ears to hear
[1:46:12] but they hear not Jesus why do you
[1:46:16] always speak to us in Parables he he
[1:46:21] said because unto them them it's not
[1:46:24] given now I want to ask you is that
[1:46:29] fair I thought God loved everybody and
[1:46:32] he's going to save everybody for God so
[1:46:34] loved the
[1:46:36] world and he would that no man
[1:46:41] perish is it fair that God would Open
[1:46:44] the Eyes of one and not the
[1:46:47] other I just plead this case to you has
[1:46:51] not the part
[1:46:53] power over the clay to make either the
[1:46:56] vessel of honor and another Of
[1:46:59] Dishonor it wasn't anything you did it
[1:47:02] was because you had
[1:47:05] representation he said my
[1:47:08] sheep hear my voice and a stranger they
[1:47:12] will not
[1:47:13] follow now th those out there they're
[1:47:16] going to follow anything anybody
[1:47:18] everybody and just go along
[1:47:23] in fact that's what Babylon means
[1:47:26] confusion they're so
[1:47:31] confused
[1:47:33] like and I've said it before but pardon
[1:47:35] me for reiterating it there was
[1:47:38] a quite a famous black
[1:47:41] preacher that was preaching here a
[1:47:43] couple months ago and somebody sent me
[1:47:45] the clip and it's quite
[1:47:47] classic and he says and
[1:47:50] today people don't know whether they're
[1:47:53] a man or a
[1:47:55] woman he says I'll tell you what a woman
[1:47:59] is you want to know what a woman is your
[1:48:05] mama he said that's right your
[1:48:13] mama oh they they cannot
[1:48:17] Define a
[1:48:21] woman there was one though that
[1:48:26] could he says who can
[1:48:28] find a virtuous woman whose price is far
[1:48:33] above rubies and
[1:48:36] Pearls who had the ability to look out
[1:48:40] among all of those and see a woman that
[1:48:43] had virtue before
[1:48:46] cleansing listen to that who had virtue
[1:48:50] before
[1:48:51] cleansing the woman at the well had
[1:48:55] virtue before
[1:48:58] cleansing do you see God was
[1:49:02] looking at each one of you and before

[1:54:33] not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but
[1:54:36] as it is written iath Not Seen Nor Ear
[1:54:39] heard neither have entered into the
[1:54:40] heart of man the things which God hath

[1:54:58] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[1:55:01] but the spirit of God now we have
[1:55:03] received not the spirit of the world but
[1:55:05] the spirit which is of god that we might
[1:55:07] know the things that are freely given to
[1:55:09] us of God which things also we speak not
[1:55:12] in The Words which man's Wisdom te not
[1:55:15] in The Words which men's wisdom
[1:55:19] speaketh but which the Holy Ghost
[1:55:21] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[1:55:24] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[1:55:27] not the things of the spirit of God for
[1:55:29] they are foolishness unto him neither
