[30:55] you to see you too just God bless you
[30:58] this evening it's always a joy to be in
[31:02] Fellowship around the good things of the
[31:04] Lord and just reading in my
[31:07] Bible um this evening as we were sitting
[31:11] there and David said has the Lord
[31:15] forgotten to be gracious and he said no
[31:19] never and uh I believe that that that he
[31:23] knows uh how to be gracious and it's a
[31:26] wonderful thing to know that he's a
[31:28] loving father and and our life is in His
[31:32] Hands So Good Times bad times it's nice
[31:36] to know that our father he's he he sees
[31:42] every detail of our life and so when
[31:45] those people came I'm sorry
[31:47] to maybe take an extra minute but you
[31:50] know when those people came in the
[31:52] prayer
[31:53] line the Lord knew every detail of their
[31:58] life and sometimes we just can't imagine
[32:01] how great God is but he is concerned and
[32:04] David one time thought that he wasn't
[32:07] interested in the details and it caused
[32:09] the Nathan the prophet said the sword's
[32:12] never going to leave your house you
[32:14] thought you could sweep something under
[32:16] the rug but you know the Lord
[32:19] cared and uh so it's just uh wonderful
[32:23] to be with you we had a couple our age
[32:27] in in our house last night and the
[32:29] sister said well we're getting old and
[32:32] we're getting um we're losing our
[32:37] credibility and and I said what what are
[32:40] you saying she said well well that you
[32:42] know they're going to everybody's going
[32:43] to start to think that we're old
[32:46] people and uh I don't feel that way I
[32:50] believe as long as I got breath you know
[32:52] there ain't no Rock going to take my
[32:54] place amen and I'm going to tell the
[32:59] younger ones uh you know what we've
[33:02] learned and it and this gospel is not
[33:05] changing so uh it's good to be in
[33:09] fellowship and uh I covet your prayers
[33:11] we're leaving Saturday for Bulgaria I'll
[33:14] probably be there Lord willing maybe a
[33:16] month and a half we just don't exactly
[33:18] know but we have some uh we did three
[33:21] messages Christmas three of brother
[33:23] bram's Christmas
[33:24] messages and we put them in a little
[33:27] Christmas box like little packet and uh
[33:31] the Nikolai did a beautiful job just
[33:34] kind of gave it a special uh Christmas
[33:37] paper and you know it's like it has a
[33:39] greeting on it in Bulgarian and and the
[33:42] Bulgarian word is Christmas is always
[33:44] white and it's so nice to go to these
[33:47] other churches you know there's not a
[33:49] established message church that that I'm
[33:52] aware of if I learn Bulgarian I might
[33:54] know a little bit more what's going on
[33:56] but we we're going to try to go and
[33:59] visit some uh just nominal churches and
[34:03] gypsy churches and bring those Christmas
[34:05] books so if you'd keep us in your
[34:08] prayers we're encouraging Lord we have a
[34:10] young man from um uh Jeffersonville Noah
[34:15] stutsman going with us and I I just felt
[34:18] like uh wasn't it Jonathan that said his
[34:22] to his armor Bearer he said let's go up
[34:25] and see what the Lord will do because
[34:27] you know it doesn't matter to the Lord
[34:29] if it's many or few and uh I appreciate
[34:32] this young man saying yeah let's let's
[34:34] go up let's go out there and see what
[34:36] God will do so God bless you brother Ron
[34:38] it's nice to be welcome here appreciate
[34:41] your friendship for all these years and
[34:44] uh God be with you all and Merry
[34:50] Christmas yeah well it is true we all
[34:54] are getting
[34:56] older uh
[34:58] and uh credibility I hope we're not
[35:00] losing that I know we're
[35:02] losing uh senility and other
[35:06] things sometimes uh your memory goes and
[35:10] different things but that's part of
[35:11] getting older and uh I'm glad I got a
[35:14] wife that reminds me whenever I forget
[35:16] things and and uh but I've noticed
[35:19] lately that she's getting a little
[35:21] forgetful too so two halves make one so
[35:26] God knows just exactly what he's doing

[41:36] prayer before heing to the emergency
[41:39] room believe God could h i I asked her

[41:46] like it's better to
[41:48] tell okay I asked her if you believe God
[41:52] and she said yes so I said I will pray
[41:56] for you and I prayed and I asked her
[42:00] after I prayed do you still believe God
[42:03] and she said yes she went to the
[42:06] emergency
[42:07] room and the doctor told
[42:10] her that her baby is okay
[42:16] amen not only
[42:19] that she came back to the church she was
[42:22] so
[42:24] excited and she was in the kitchen in
[42:27] helping the sisters to cook food to the
[42:31] Believers amen it's about a lot a lot of
[42:34] Believers you know the the so many uh
[42:38] things to to do to help and she was
[42:41] there helping the
[42:43] sisters
[42:46] now um the second
[42:50] one uh this one was last uh last year I
[42:54] was there that evening that dinner uh
[42:57] Fellowship I was speaking to the
[42:59] Believers then the family approached me
[43:02] with an interpreter they wanted to share
[43:05] what had happened after last year
[43:08] meeting when I preached about the sword
[43:11] of the Lord in the hands of the
[43:13] Believers during that sermon I came down
[43:16] from the pulpit and though I could REM
[43:19] remember his face I handed the sword to
[43:22] a young man according to his grandmother
[43:25] from that moment he be became a
[43:27] different person his parents were an
[43:31] addicts who had been in trouble with
[43:34] drug dealers their home was filled with
[43:38] conflict but that young man persistently
[43:42] urging them to stop fighting and turn to
[43:45] God his parents were backsliders but he
[43:49] didn't give up he keep encouraging them
[43:52] to return the Lord eventually thee uh
[43:55] the pressure lead them back to the
[43:57] fellowship one day while traveling to
[44:00] Mexico this young man traveled to Mexico
[44:03] because the parents wants to move
[44:06] somewhere because they were in trouble
[44:09] with the drug
[44:11] dealers so his parents uh his dad and
[44:15] his brother were traveling to
[44:18] Monteray and there was a car
[44:22] accident and this young man died on that
[44:26] car accident
[44:30] so when he
[44:32] died I told the family I prayed for them
[44:36] I said someone must to
[44:39] die he gave his life and his family with
[44:43] returned to church and now
[44:45] Faithfully serves the Lord and after
[44:49] praying
[44:50] together I went to another fellowship
[44:53] because it's so many people so I went to
[44:56] another another fellowship another
[44:58] groups of
[44:59] Believers
[45:01] and they were you know I was sharing the
[45:06] testimony that is Christianity is not
[45:09] about quoting the
[45:12] Bible Christianity is not only reciting
[45:16] the
[45:17] message the message must live in Us in
[45:24] you and then I was uh I I told them that
[45:29] you need to know the author of The Bible
[45:32] without that experience we're M
[45:36] merely parting the
[45:40] message we need to know who we
[45:44] are
[45:46] or there will be no power in
[45:49] us I shared the story about brother
[45:51] Brenham going to an auction with a
[45:54] Rancher friend there was a Skinny Cow
[45:58] that sold for
[46:00] 11,000 while a big healthy looking good
[46:04] cow sold for
[46:08] $300 C curiously brother brandham asked
[46:12] with the Skinny Cow uh sold for much
[46:15] more his friend explained that in the
[46:18] cattle business external appearances
[46:21] don't up always determine the
[46:24] value it's about the C house breeding
[46:28] and
[46:29] lineage the lesson was that as
[46:33] Christians if we lack of a genuine
[46:36] experience with God trials will reveal
[46:40] our lack of uh the trials will reveal
[46:44] and our lack of
[46:46] foundation and we may fall away that's
[46:50] why you see many Christians falling away
[46:54] because of lack of experience
[46:57] while I was
[46:58] sharing there was a
[47:01] commotion and people started screaming
[47:04] called brother
[47:06] Warren I went to a family holding a
[47:11] baby the baby was pale
[47:14] white and the parents explained that the
[47:17] baby had fallen earlier but seems spine
[47:22] and that time however when they put the
[47:25] baby to sleep the child child had a
[47:28] scissure seizure and his uh the eyes was
[47:33] turning big according to the
[47:36] parents the parents handed the baby to
[47:39] me when I touched the baby's head I feel
[47:44] that it seems like a crack in the skull
[47:48] and I told to the
[47:49] father that the baby has had the damage
[47:54] skull the baby was one years old he's uh
[47:58] uh Oney
[48:00] old so I
[48:03] assume with a CPR on first aid because I
[48:07] am certified
[48:10] CPR uh I I renew my CPR on first aid
[48:14] every two
[48:16] years so because of my training I was
[48:19] ready to resuscitate the
[48:22] baby but God is more powerful amen
[48:27] I feel that the power of God take over
[48:31] instead of relying on my training I
[48:34] started praying and holding the baby
[48:38] tightly the baby felt unusually heavy
[48:43] like a dead weight if you hold a dead
[48:47] people
[48:48] before that's why you carry a dead
[48:51] person you carry uh the nurses can can
[48:55] can uh knows that
[48:57] dead weight so I was holding the baby a
[49:01] one-year-old
[49:05] baby on my
[49:07] hip because of of the Dead
[49:12] weight the baby wasn't
[49:16] breathing and uh so I
[49:21] prayed and I cried out to the
[49:24] Lord I screamed like Lord we are in a
[49:28] state of
[49:29] emergency right
[49:32] now and then and that I thank him for
[49:37] his sacrifice on the
[49:39] cross the pastor brother bito Garcia was
[49:43] with
[49:44] me and then the the the brothers the
[49:50] ministers uh they uh placed her their
[49:53] hands on the head of the baby
[49:56] while other ministers including brother
[49:58] Bena one of the assistant Minister was
[50:02] holding the feet and the the other
[50:05] minister brother um elaser was behind
[50:11] me
[50:13] about the brother said it's about five
[50:16] minutes that the baby wasn't
[50:19] breathing and to me I I think it's
[50:22] longer than that because I prayed we
[50:25] prayed and then we stopped
[50:27] and then I started praying
[50:31] again then I felt the jerk of the baby
[50:36] so I lift the baby up on my chest the
[50:40] baby is not heavy
[50:42] anymore and all of the sudden he
[50:44] breathed and cried out with a loud
[50:48] voice and she and the baby opened his
[50:53] eyes I've been to many experience
[50:58] I shared you one time about the demon
[51:01] possessed I shared one time about the
[51:04] women that I overdosed
[51:07] her I so many
[51:10] testimonies but this is the first time
[51:13] that the dead baby rose from the
[51:20] dead tell
[51:22] me about Christ
[51:28] the message of the hour is alive because
[51:31] it's Jesus
[51:34] Christ

[51:39] uh right now in our services in our uh
[51:43] service to the Believers that watch out

[1:02:42] ministry there's no
[1:02:45] death in Christ amen amen
[1:02:58] in the third
[1:03:00] pool how many the the the scripture
[1:03:04] said in 1 Corinthians chapter 15
[1:03:09] 5-7 500 people saw the resurrection of
[1:03:15] Jesus
[1:03:18] Christ but how
[1:03:21] many went to the upper room brother

[1:05:28] this on December 7th over there in
[1:05:33] Matamoros and I saw the power of
[1:05:37] God desperation said the the feeling
[1:05:42] that you have when you're in such in a
[1:05:46] bad
[1:05:47] situation that you are willing to take
[1:05:50] the
[1:05:52] risk in order to ch change
[1:05:56] it you are willing to take the RIS in
[1:06:01] order to change the
[1:06:04] situation and then here was
[1:06:08] Esther Esther and morai when he heard in
[1:06:13] Esther chapter
[1:06:14] 3:13 the Bible said and the letters were
[1:06:18] sent by the post into all the kings and
[1:06:22] provinces through
[1:06:24] neon he hat hated the the the the Jews
[1:06:28] he hated uh
[1:06:29] morai so he sent he gave money to the
[1:06:34] king and the King gave him the ring and
[1:06:37] he ordered that on March uh 13 all the
[1:06:42] Jews will be
[1:06:45] exterminated so here it said of uh the
[1:06:48] to cause to destroy all all the Jews and
[1:06:52] to uh kill them to cause them to perish
[1:06:56] all Jews both young and old little
[1:06:59] children and women and in that uh in one
[1:07:04] day even upon the 13th day of the 12
[1:07:08] month which is the month Adar and to
[1:07:12] take the spoil of them to
[1:07:16] pray and here was morai when he heard
[1:07:21] the
[1:07:22] news do you think about this the Second
[1:07:25] World War
[1:07:26] this one was
[1:07:28] different this one will the the king
[1:07:31] ordered men and women to be destroyed in
[1:07:35] one
[1:07:36] day but here was
[1:07:39] Esther morai was was was uh uh CH how
[1:07:46] did he uh what did he do he was crying
[1:07:50] in the midst of the the uh the
[1:07:53] city and the new went to Esther and and
[1:07:57] the news said uh Mori your
[1:08:02] cousin he was
[1:08:04] crying asking to there was there are
[1:08:08] here's the help uh forgive me if I
[1:08:12] jump sometimes but here was
[1:08:17] morai according to the
[1:08:20] scholars This Book of
[1:08:23] Esther is not supposed to be in the
[1:08:26] Bible you know why because there's no
[1:08:29] God
[1:08:31] mention about this this story of of
[1:08:36] Esther but how can you how can you um
[1:08:42] fast if there's no
[1:08:45] prayer right so you read between the
[1:08:48] line because this message is for the
[1:08:51] bride and the bridegroom the story of
[1:08:54] the bride and the the
[1:08:56] bridegroom when the Malachi chapter 4
[1:08:59] came God the the prophet took
[1:09:03] this this message and and give an an
[1:09:06] Enlightenment to the bride that this was
[1:09:09] like talking to my
[1:09:12] bridegroom and here was you know why
[1:09:14] what happened why there was a a bad bad
[1:09:19] blood with nonon and
[1:09:22] morai can you remember about the story
[1:09:26] of
[1:09:27] Samuel and Saul saved the
[1:09:31] agagite the
[1:09:33] king the
[1:09:35] agagite remember that story and then
[1:09:38] Samuel
[1:09:39] said uh uh uh the the I think um there
[1:09:45] was a um obedience is better than
[1:09:50] sacrifice so now here was
[1:09:53] Samuel because he saved the King the
[1:09:55] agagite and and Saul was a
[1:10:00] benjamite and here Saul or Samuel pulled
[1:10:04] his sword and hacked the agagite king in
[1:10:09] pieces and I think this agagite neon
[1:10:14] remember that
[1:10:15] story how he had a h an
[1:10:20] anger to this man
[1:10:24] morai but but my focus is not morai and
[1:10:27] Damon my focus tonight is Esther how she
[1:10:32] pray how she how she went to the to the
[1:10:36] king and how she
[1:10:39] fast but then when she was fasting after
[1:10:42] the fasting it takes an
[1:10:45] action and here was the action of of of
[1:10:48] of eser according to the law you cannot
[1:10:53] enter to the Chamber of the king without
[1:10:56] the the the the the how do you call it
[1:10:59] the the request of the
[1:11:03] king but here was
[1:11:05] Esther you know why she said for 30 days
[1:11:10] the king never called me to to come to
[1:11:13] his
[1:11:14] chamber well maybe the king have 500
[1:11:18] wives and it's not her
[1:11:21] turn but she said if I die I die I'm
[1:11:25] thinking about my
[1:11:27] people this is for my
[1:11:29] people and according to the scripture
[1:11:32] she put her
[1:11:34] royal
[1:11:36] robe and what is the Royal
[1:11:39] robe we put on the word of God Amen and
[1:11:44] when the king saw that she was so
[1:11:47] beautiful and the
[1:11:49] King if he
[1:11:53] will lift up his sep
[1:11:56] she will come but if the king will not
[1:11:59] lift up the scepter she will die right
[1:12:02] there but because of the beauty of
[1:12:07] Esther she won the heart of the king and
[1:12:10] the King said you are so beautiful
[1:12:14] Esther what is your request and even the
[1:12:17] H of my kingdom is
[1:12:19] yours and she came and explained about
[1:12:23] the invitation of Ammon and the king for
[1:12:26] a
[1:12:27] dinner and to make the story short
[1:12:30] because I will jump you know what
[1:12:35] happened hmon was
[1:12:38] hang and the Jews were
[1:12:41] saved and all the people that supposed
[1:12:44] to kill the
[1:12:45] Jews morai killed them all
[1:12:50] 7,500 Jews or or or uh the the people of
[1:12:55] was killed that
[1:12:57] time and then
[1:12:59] children of neon were
[1:13:03] hanged because of the perseverance
[1:13:06] because of the desperation of Esther
[1:13:09] that she said if I die I die at least I
[1:13:13] made I I I made my
[1:13:17] way amen
[1:13:26] how about I I I took some characters
[1:13:29] here in the
[1:13:42] Bible the prophet said
[1:13:44] here we have played long
[1:13:48] enough can you can you say yes we played
[1:13:51] long
[1:13:52] enough you know
[1:13:55] we went to church long
[1:13:59] enough how many years you've been
[1:14:01] hearing this message we went to a church
[1:14:04] long
[1:14:06] enough but he said we got to do
[1:14:11] something this is not the time of
[1:14:13] playing church anymore brothers and
[1:14:17] sisters the prophet said until you get
[1:14:21] to that
[1:14:22] place until the whole church get to that
[1:14:26] place that it's between
[1:14:29] death or life or and life you got to
[1:14:34] have it now or
[1:14:38] perish then God will move on the sin it
[1:14:42] takes a desperation to bring God on the
[1:14:46] sin we played long enough my
[1:14:51] friends it takes a state of emergency
[1:14:55] if someone needs help you raise your
[1:14:58] hand brother I will pray for
[1:15:02] you sister Maggie had a testimony one
[1:15:07] time about the the situation it's
[1:15:11] between life or
[1:15:13] death between life and death
[1:15:18] situation but she have a
[1:15:22] husband that has powerful faith
[1:15:27] that was the big mistakes of Satan that
[1:15:29] day when Maggie went to the hospital and
[1:15:33] the doctor said your cancer is so
[1:15:37] fast the cancer is eating you you need
[1:15:40] to go to the operating
[1:15:43] room but her

[1:16:37] be we don't pray to
[1:16:41] ourselves instead she was praying to
[1:16:44] Sister
[1:16:47] Rebecca and it fulfilled her
[1:16:50] prayers because not only sister Rebecca
[1:16:53] came back to church

[1:19:07] prophet that the baby was smiling on her
[1:19:12] chest and the prophet said bring that
[1:19:15] baby here God answered the prayers of
[1:19:19] that desperate woman
[1:19:25] there was a woman one
[1:19:30] day the prophet said forgive me but this
[1:19:32] is the prophet said she was an
[1:19:36] illiterate colored
[1:19:40] woman maybe she doesn't
[1:19:43] know
[1:19:45] about
[1:19:47] science but she
[1:19:50] believe that the shunamite woman needs
[1:19:53] Elijah
[1:19:55] and she was praying that night brother
[1:19:58] she was praying that night that Elijah

[1:20:53] desperate
[1:20:55] God wants us to be desperate well
[1:20:58] brother Warren that's like that's that's
[1:21:00] like a Pentecostal message no brothers
[1:21:02] and sisters after the prophet preached
[1:21:05] the token he preached this desperate
[1:21:08] desperation because he said the church
[1:21:11] need to be desperate
[1:21:14] amen you want to go to the Rapture be
[1:21:22] desperate something wrongs with the
[1:21:25] airplane the airplane went went back to
[1:21:30] Memphis and you know what happened to to
[1:21:32] the prophet he went to the store and
[1:21:34] looking for a a goodies for the
[1:21:37] kids but there was a voice go
[1:21:41] walk go
[1:21:43] walk lead by the spirit brother go walk
[1:21:48] where do you want me to go Lord where do
[1:21:51] you want me to go just go walk be lead
[1:21:54] by the spirit
[1:21:55] spirit and
[1:21:57] then while he was
[1:21:59] walking in front of her brother in front
[1:22:02] of him there was a colored woman said
[1:22:05] good morning
[1:22:07] Parson my accent is different but good
[1:22:10] morning
[1:22:12] person said why how do you know me I'm a
[1:22:15] person because I I prayed for you last
[1:22:19] night see that
[1:22:21] Fai why she knows that brother is a
[1:22:25] pastor because of her
[1:22:28] prayer because of my
[1:22:32] prayer once you
[1:22:34] prayed you expect don't doubt your
[1:22:39] prayers sometimes the doubt are the best
[1:22:43] enemy that can destroy our
[1:22:47] faith and then when the prophet
[1:22:50] said he said um I've been to a King's
[1:22:56] house I've been to a noble
[1:22:58] people but this small
[1:23:03] house one kitchen and one bedroom and
[1:23:06] one living
[1:23:09] room or one
[1:23:11] bedroom and the according to the prophet
[1:23:14] the boy was
[1:23:17] groaning according to the mother he's
[1:23:19] like in the midst of the
[1:23:21] ocean and he said always and he always
[1:23:24] say oh it's dark in here mama it's dark
[1:23:27] in here
[1:23:29] mama and the prophet
[1:23:31] said this
[1:23:33] house is the house of a woman that knows
[1:23:38] how to
[1:23:40] pray so she he he asked the woman uh uh
[1:23:44] uh the woman asked brother Brenham to
[1:23:46] pray but brother Brenham said you
[1:23:49] pray and brother according to the
[1:23:51] prophet that woman can pray
[1:23:55] that woman can
[1:23:57] pray it's I it's better she pray really
[1:24:01] good because it's between life and death
[1:24:05] situation but like Esther if I die I die
[1:24:09] I don't care
[1:24:10] anymore I'm I'm I'm I I I'm saving my
[1:24:15] whole family I'm saving my
[1:24:18] whole all the Jews
[1:24:24] how about
[1:24:26] shamgar you know what happened I I will
[1:24:28] continue this when the prophet prayed he
[1:24:32] said there's a light in here coming mama
[1:24:35] there's a light in here coming mama you
[1:24:37] know why because of the
[1:24:40] atmosphere of that
[1:24:44] woman and not only God healed that woman
[1:24:48] that
[1:24:49] man but after three months brother
[1:24:52] Brenham saw that boy
[1:24:55] not only healed but
[1:24:58] saved that's the faith of Abraham I
[1:25:01] don't care about this flesh I care about
[1:25:05] my
[1:25:07] soul but the soul will manifest
[1:25:12] outside because that's our it's our
[1:25:14] children the prophet said that's
[1:25:16] children's
[1:25:18] bread healing is God's children's
[1:25:22] bread now here is is the
[1:25:26] shamgar shamgar was
[1:25:28] always you you know that sometimes
[1:25:31] brother brother
[1:25:33] Bryant you know we we we talk about last
[1:25:36] time about the
[1:25:38] situation but s Satan that's what he
[1:25:41] wants us to do he wants us to to to be
[1:25:45] weak and to question about our healing
[1:25:49] to question about God if he's real or
[1:25:52] not but brother our faith is
[1:25:58] unmovable you can destroy this body
[1:26:00] brother Neil I will question I will
[1:26:03] question
[1:26:04] you when you were in the hospital is it
[1:26:08] job 13 was real to
[1:26:11] you destroy this body and in my flesh I
[1:26:15] will see
[1:26:18] God it must be the scripture we be real
[1:26:22] to us because it life and death
[1:26:25] situation brother Neil but if you if I
[1:26:28] die I die at least I fight the
[1:26:35] battle shamgar was always every every
[1:26:39] year the enemy comes to him and while he
[1:26:43] was he was uh ready to to to uh Harvest
[1:26:50] his grapes the enem is already coming
[1:26:54] and until he saw his family weak and
[1:26:58] skinny but it takes the desperation one
[1:27:02] year he recognized his position as the
[1:27:05] Son of God as the son of
[1:27:09] Abraham and then he started get
[1:27:13] angry he started get
[1:27:15] angry and he took the
[1:27:18] stick because he's so angry to the 300
[1:27:22] demons Brothers he destroyed all the 300
[1:27:26] demons because of the faith he
[1:27:29] recognized his position as the son of
[1:27:35] Abraham we need to recognize our
[1:27:37] position as a son and daughters of
[1:27:43] Abraham here was
[1:27:46] Peter Peter one day he said let me walk
[1:27:49] Lord let me
[1:27:51] walk and Jesus said walk
[1:27:55] his faith was so strong that he really
[1:27:58] wants to
[1:28:00] walk but here was Peter when he was
[1:28:04] walking he saw troubles
[1:28:08] coming and he
[1:28:10] sunk what did Peter
[1:28:13] say ah well my faith is too weak I will
[1:28:17] let this body drowned in the sea no
[1:28:21] brother you fight he said look Lord help
[1:28:25] me he cried cried with a loud voice Lord
[1:28:28] help
[1:28:29] me and God is always on time he took his
[1:28:34] he he reached out with his hand
[1:28:37] Brothers don't always think that God is
[1:28:41] late he knows the
[1:28:45] situation think about sadrach mishak and
[1:28:49] Abednego do you
[1:28:51] think God was late that day
[1:28:54] when they said put me in the
[1:28:57] oven God will save
[1:29:01] us how about was God was like I'll take
[1:29:04] a nap like right now maybe later I will
[1:29:07] wake
[1:29:08] up I'll I'll watch the
[1:29:11] situation
[1:29:14] brother the three Hebrew CH
[1:29:17] children when they went
[1:29:20] inside God is already there he's not too
[1:29:23] long late for your question for your for
[1:29:25] the answer he always come on time in
[1:29:29] time of Deeds call me in the days of
[1:29:31] your
[1:29:32] trouble and I will answer Thee I am the
[1:29:37] untime god The Great I Am God that
[1:29:41] present tense help in time of trouble
[1:29:47] amen how about
[1:29:49] Daniel how about Daniel maybe he was
[1:29:52] when when when the the enemy of Daniel
[1:29:55] put him inside the
[1:29:57] Cave the
[1:29:59] hole the hungry lion was
[1:30:02] waiting but when he was he went
[1:30:06] there God was already
[1:30:09] there he wasn't late brother to your
[1:30:12] question he wasn't late for your
[1:30:15] troubles but we need to be
[1:30:18] desperate and the lion was laying
[1:30:22] already instead of roaring
[1:30:26] like the lion
[1:30:31] sound you know why because the pillar of
[1:30:34] fire was in the midst of that
[1:30:39] cave and
[1:30:41] Daniel what he did he enjoyed the
[1:30:44] promise of God thank you
[1:30:46] Lord and he used the belly of the lion
[1:30:50] better than my pillow brother Dennis
[1:30:56] better than my
[1:30:59] pillow because God is always on time in
[1:31:02] his
[1:31:06] promise how
[1:31:20] about here's God
[1:31:24] Jesus Christ in Luke Chapter 189 uh 9 or
[1:31:30] 1 up to
[1:31:32] 9 he gave a
[1:31:36] comparison he
[1:31:42] said there was a city there was in a
[1:31:46] city a judge which fearth not God
[1:31:51] neither regarded man
[1:31:54] this God is an
[1:31:56] unbeliever worse than

[1:37:43] story of this woman of this
[1:37:46] girl and Gypsy
[1:37:50] Smith and when when they went back in
[1:37:53] the back of the building to go out that
[1:37:57] night there was a poor little ragged
[1:37:59] girl standing there she was all her
[1:38:01] clothes was all tore off of her and she
[1:38:06] had something she said she wanted to see
[1:38:09] Mr Smith so Gypsy Smith said what do you
[1:38:14] want darling said Mr Smith I didn't have
[1:38:18] any money to give you but said about a
[1:38:22] month ago it was at Christmas and
[1:38:24] somebody gave me a
[1:38:26] lollipop I love you uh so much Mr Smith
[1:38:30] said my daddy got saved he's not drunk
[1:38:34] card anymore said I thought I bring this
[1:38:38] I bring you this lowly pop Mr Smith took
[1:38:42] it in his hand tears rolling down his
[1:38:46] cheeks patted her on her hand and said
[1:38:51] honey in my offering to tonight lays as
[1:38:55] much as thousands of dollars in checks
[1:38:59] but this is the greatest gift that I got
[1:39:04] of all of
[1:39:07] it what's in your hand right
[1:39:12] now that hand can
[1:39:16] touch
[1:39:17] God if God can use the stick to kill 300
[1:39:22] Philistines
[1:39:24] what is your what's in your hand Gypsy
[1:39:27] smth has thousands of
[1:39:30] dollars in his bank but he wasn't
[1:39:35] happy he was a powerful preacher
[1:39:38] troubled the
[1:39:41] world but he cried out because God used
[1:39:46] that girl to touch his
[1:39:48] heart because of that
[1:39:52] lollipop amen
[1:39:59] there was a woman one
[1:40:02] day this woman was suffering for 12
[1:40:06] years of blood
[1:40:09] issue the prophet said she went to many
[1:40:13] doctors to find the best
[1:40:17] Specialist of that
[1:40:21] cancer that woman
[1:40:24] woman
[1:40:25] because of 12 Years of coming back and
[1:40:28] forth to the doctor she lost all of her
[1:40:33] wealth and moved to the banks of the
[1:40:39] river she doesn't have any more
[1:40:42] strength one month of blood lost in your
[1:40:46] in your body you will be weak how much
[1:40:49] more for 12 years
[1:40:53] think about the
[1:40:55] story not only that my brothers and
[1:40:59] sisters she doesn't have money anymore
[1:41:02] she is
[1:41:03] empty that's the time God will call you
[1:41:07] that's the time God will say now you're
[1:41:12] empty who will you call
[1:41:14] now and that's the start when she heard
[1:41:20] there's so many voices that that day oh
[1:41:24] Jesus the deceiver Jesus the
[1:41:27] Healer but because of Faith she choose
[1:41:32] Jesus the
[1:41:33] Healer 12 years my brothers and sisters
[1:41:36] how can you press to the crowd for 12
[1:41:40] years of loose of of blood but she
[1:41:43] doesn't care about the the pushing and
[1:41:47] push the people for maybe thousands and
[1:41:49] 5 thousands of people were there but she
[1:41:53] she press she press because of her faith
[1:41:57] that if I touch the Hy of His Garment I
[1:42:00] will be
[1:42:02] healed she was so desperate that day she
[1:42:06] pressed maybe she was crawling maybe she
[1:42:09] did everything that she got this is the
[1:42:12] last maybe of my life if I die I die
[1:42:17] today at at least I did my best to touch
[1:42:21] the hym of the Garment of the
[1:42:24] Lord but when she was maybe close enough
[1:42:28] close enough brother brother uh Briant
[1:42:31] she maybe stretch a little bit her
[1:42:35] hand and then the
[1:42:38] power of that
[1:42:41] garment touched the
[1:42:44] master and the master said who touched
[1:42:46] me and Peter rebuked the Lord so many
[1:42:50] people keep touching you and now you
[1:42:53] but virtue came out of
[1:42:57] me do you want to touch God do you want
[1:43:00] the virtue to come out of God touch him
[1:43:03] with
[1:43:05] desperation if I die Lord today I will
[1:43:08] die at least I give my
[1:43:15] best not only
[1:43:17] that can you please brother Leviticus uh

[1:43:42] woman have an issue and her issue in her
[1:43:47] flesh Be Blood 15 19 up to 20 uh 30 but

[1:43:55] verses she put apart seven days and
[1:43:58] whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean
[1:44:01] until even so if the woman has period
[1:44:05] and she will sit to this to this chair

[1:44:22] layth upon in her separation shall be
[1:44:25] unclean everything also that she Seth
[1:44:28] upon shall be unclean and if a woman uh
[1:44:31] 25 and if a woman have an issue of her
[1:44:35] blood many days out of the time of her
