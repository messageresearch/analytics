========================================

is that right God being alone that's why when he saw Adam he said this is not good that man is alone but the man was not alone he had his wife in him so God was not so alone in that sense because all that God was within him but alone also means all in one and God said it is not good that all is in one Hallelujah God looked at Adam and he said I know how it is Adam so it is not do good that you are all in one Hallelujah amen so we understand this is God's desire again I want to read a few statements of the Prophet that just really to to see where we are coming from brother I'm saying what is God the great Eternal at the beginning way back before there was a beginning he wasn't even God did you know that God is an object of worship and there was nothing to worship him he lived alone and in him was attributes what does an attribute a thought now you get something that will buy that will bother on the lesson he said that he was his attributes that was in him God was his attributes that was in him and if you are an attribute of God you are God I don't speak of this human body absolutely not is that right but of who you really are because finally Rotherham said you've never seen me you just seen the outside man but the Inside Man is there you know what the inside man is made in the image of God is that correct just expressing himself on the outside now and one day Church it will be such a reality it will change our mortal bodies it's like a woman that has a child inside of her there comes a time she cannot hold it and Christ has grown that Revelation has grown in US and you see how how much it comes to it now I was really focusing to the end so Christ becomes so real inside of you it will change your mortal bodies Hallelujah this is the only thing that we're waiting for that Immortal ball is Roman ate it will be changed the final step of adoption is we get a new body is that right amen but it is inside of you the Rapture is inside of you the changes inside of you is not something from outside changes something from inside changing you well I'm saying like in the beginning God just permitted sin to come he didn't not he that wasn't his perfect will he permitted sin to come that wasn't his perfect will but he permitted it he said but you see God the great spirit the father in him with attributes and these things that you see this plate now is just his attributes being displayed because he dwelt alone amen so God dwelt Alone he was all in one this is that is how he looked to Adam he said that's not good that the man is alone because God said Adam I know how you feel because I was in the same stage I was all in one and when I was all in one I could not have Fellowship with my attributes Hallelujah amen now let's turn quickly to First Corinthians 15. First Corinthians 15 because we will see what really comes finally out at the end First Corinthians 15. can we say praise the Lord Hallelujah amen we serve a wonderful God Hallelujah I'm so excited because I know where I'm going I know where we come to and I know when you get there you will be excited I know that I'm sorry but I cannot because we want to see the way we want to really enjoy this road of Discovery we really want to enjoy it every step of it rejoice in the good days rejoice in the bad days sorry to say so enjoy the good days and enjoy the bad days say praise the Lord in the good days say praise the Lord in the bad days confuse the enemy confuse him the bride on Earth she is able to get the enemy to have a heart attack you can make the devil mad you can be the cause for him to take his heartfields because he just don't know what to do with you [Applause] he can throw everything on you he can he can he can collapse your home come on Church God can allow that he can allow that he is God is he God of your life so then he can do whatever he wants whatever he's trying to show he can do with it do we give them the allowance this evening Hallelujah he's not only Jehovah Jireh oh it was so so wonderful brother Ron handed me a little paper while I was coming here I was sitting in the plane it just came to me he's not just only Jehovah Jireh he's not only Jehovah don't limit him down to that expression he's Jehovah's he's Jehovah Shama our peace Hallelujah and when God decides I want to be Sharma to you what do you need storm come on Church you need storms so he can show that he's the Lord our peace you don't need peace in peace you need peace in the time of storm oh I trust we God we serve it we great God how great is our God Hallelujah and he decided he said Satan what you have done in my Eden I do in your Eden you came into my Eden by the way I allowed you you came into my Eden defied my bride in my Eden so now I come into your Eden and to bring a bride to perfection in your Eden [Music] this is his decision he didn't ask you if he could do it he just asked you do you want to be a part of it so don't be amazed when things go wrong oh my oh my my let's confuse the devil this evening when the devil bothers your mind said you look your family is upside down everything goes wrong say praise the Lord oh yeah just you tried to you tried to play he said no I'm not playing I know what God is doing because when I am weak he is strong when there's a storm coming he can prove that he's still Jehovah he's a present help in time so you need trouble I mean like I said let's let's get out of every box let's get out really that's what the prophet said come out of every camp the camp of your own understanding the camp of your own limitation brother Adam said my greatest enemy is not my wife is also not my church it's also not my brother and my sister said the greatest enemy that I have is William Branham he said when I get that guy out of the way then God can do things that William Branham is not even dreaming of do you believe that that God can do things tonight with you that you cannot even dream of oh let's confuse the enemy church we have a reason we have a reason to be joyful and happy in all circumstances because we know why we are here we know why we are here to express all that God is and he's not just only this why brother Ron was handing me that little paper I said you know it's sometimes how the Lord is really working in a wonderful I was sitting in the plane writing it down all Jehovah the the seven Redemptive names of Jehovah or or titles however the prophet called it that was manifested in Jesus Christ is that right and all that Christ was is nowhere so what do you expect now don't limit him just to this he want to show all that he is Hallelujah that's why brother Adam said he said law of contrast that if you had no rain you would not appreciate the Sun if you had no winter you wouldn't appreciate the summer if you had no evil you would not appreciate good we would not even know that he is a good god if there was not the devil all things he created he created for his own pleasure hallelujah what a mighty God we serve hallelujah what a mighty God we serve he's so great that he could create the devil knowing how he would turn and he was not nervous when iniquity was found in him Hallelujah it's the father behind it Hallelujah it is the father in the beginning it was on First Corinthians 15. we want to read once again says 15 24. to 28. listen what how Paul is really wonderful describing it then comes the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he shall have put down all Rule and all authority and Power for he must Reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death for he has put all things under his feet but when he said all things are put under him it is manifested that he is expected which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him and put all things under him that God maybe not alone anymore but now God can be all and in all this is his plan this is his plan God that was alone now he is God of all and in all that is the final worship that he will receive when he can be God of all and he can be God in all what a evolution now don't don't get the thought wrong now we're not speaking of evolution like we here in in usual but we are speaking of the evolution of the spirit Hallelujah the great God unveiling unfolding himself brother Adam said let me give you a few statements he said you understand he said in in The Invisible Union brother Adam said just like the evolution came just like the first thing God created probably botany life then he created animal life next and he created human life next kind of an evolution Rising higher so has it been God and his church justification under Luther sanctification pulling out his bride he is creating his pride justification andaluta sanctification under Vaseline and there was evolution of the spirit been giving more and more because the body is building coming to the head which is Christ the body of Christ yes sir amen countdown message 1962. this is exactly what the Bible said he did he made first the trees the botany life then he made then the last thing that ever come on the earth it was in form of creation was men nothing higher ever come because why it was a perfect reflection of the highest in heaven which God is men see God is men so therefore it proves and when God comes down and dwell among us he was a man and man it shows that the Perfection of evolution was God which is men let's go a little let's go a little further is it okay so far I don't speak of humanity and speak of men of mankind not of who men but of men human is like who man but we speak of men mankind look how what he did in the beginning let's we go to the Garden of Eden where he was really doing it what did he create first you know in Genesis 1 4 he made the light and it was when he had created the light and everything around he looked and God said it's good is that right he said it's good whatsoever good means for him he never said I think I did it good he saw the light it's good he said remember he had expression in his mind so the light is good for expression sir God wasn't attacking on the shoulder boy you did it good he saw the light and he said it is good Genesis 1 10 and he made the earth and the Seas and it was good they looked to the Earth he looked to the Seas and he said it's good he made the grass the herb healing seed the trees and it was good is that right amen so what what was God calling good he looked at it and he said that's good he made the sun and the moon and the stars and it was good all he created all the things that he created was for worship and God said that's good he looks at this building which is created for worship and it is good but when he sees you he gets excited amen when he sees the building he said that's nice that's good it's good you know it's good for worship but when he sees you yeah he does just not just say it's good he looks at you he said that's very good now let's turn Genesis 1 21 we just speak of worship Church and God wants to be worshiped God wants to express himself and he can do it through the sun is that right if you see the sonics expressing God and God said that son is good there it is just showing a part of who I am when he saw the light he said it is part of who I am through the light through the sun through the Earth through the trees you go in nature who do you see you see God is that right can you see God in nature nature is expressing God they're not trying to amen they're not trying to they're just manifesting expressing God when you see the great lying walking he he doesn't bother how can I express God what can I do to express God he's just doing what he has to do he's doing what he's created for Hallelujah he made the Earth he made the botanic life you make the animal life and the Bible said and it was good Genesis 1 25 then he made man in his own image then he made man in his own image and when he saw him he said it's very good nothing can express me like men can we say praise the Lord Hallelujah we just want to see a little bit why God did what he did by the way you know what day he created men he created man on the sixth day sex by six is the number of men is that right and as we see six we always feel funny don't get too spiritual with this you know but he made him on the sixth day this book how many books is in this book 66. the prophet Isaiah wrote a miniature Bible how many chapters is in Isaiah 66. not 33 that would maybe fit our box not 55. not 77. not even 88. sorry when I say that just to make it clear 66 books and you read I hope every day out of it 66. what is this book The Story of Man come on from his creation to his fall to his full restoration that's why in the beginning in Genesis 1. in the spirit of God moved upon the waters and God spoke it shall be light in the last book of this in Revelation the spirit is not alone because the Bible said and the spirit and the bride say come you see the story what God is in his mind he started alone in Genesis 1. but after 66 book he's not alone anymore now it is him and his bride speaking the same thing [Applause] what a mighty God we serve Hallelujah oh there's so many things I want to go so behind everything is the father like we would say would see even the Garden of Eden how he had eaten for worship and now he had Adam and Eve to worship and watch now how the father is doing it is God doing it now he put his son to sleep he put Adam to sleep it's always the father you know the story of Rebecca in the Bible that we are so proud of that we are part of Rebecca and then we had in elieza but you know who sent elieza out Abraham it was not Isaac looking for a wife it was Abraham looking for a wife for Isaac it was the father what was in the mind of the father why he was so concerned to get a good wife for his son why was God in the beginning putting Adam to sleep and he said I will take care for a wife for you amen because it is always the father that is trying to unveil and reveal himself Hallelujah it is the father trying to show more of himself so he told elieza Abraham told elieza you go to a certain place don't go anywhere don't get me a bride that is not able to manifest more of me amen because when is God Abraham and Isaac and Abraham did not want to have another Isaac he wanted to show more of him can we say praise the Lord I trust forget the picture of what God is doing he was he was looking for a bride for his son that's why at Calvary he put the son to sleep foreign amen showing again that this is not the work of the Sun this is the work of the father you know why he did that because he wanted to he needed you that's why he made you he is not only our creator he is Our Redeemer and he is also our husband he's all in all and he is creating you for his pleasure amen he took you out of Jesus Christ like he took Eve out of Adam like he was looking for a wife for his son Isaac the Father Abraham was looking we read the wonderful example in Matthew 22 and father making a marriage for his son father is inviting is that right it's not the son inviting it's a father inviting you know who the son is find in this chapter the bride Hallelujah it is the father that is looking inviting to come to the wedding the father gets upset and somebody don't want to come amen so it was the father inviting for the wedding of his son because the Father Knows only the right kind of wife is expressing through the sun more of me this is what God is doing Hallelujah this is why he put Christ at Calvary to sleep to take a bride out of his sight he made him a wife is that right like Adam was put to sleep and God formed the woman out of him and then you understand the whole situation actually started and then God allowed the fall God working in thick Darkness you're still with me this is what Solomon saw said oh God is generating worship in a great mistake Mystic mystical form he's just generating worship after worship after worship now you see how it how was in the garden of to really make that a little bit more plain before we really go on and and and and get a step further we just really want to see how it was in Genesis and what God really created or made man for and put him made him from the dust of the Earth and gave him a wife and then you know in the beginning he said multiplay and replenish the Earth and listen what's how brother Venom nicely how he really nicely put it and I trust I'm not going too far here and there but just to show what we are dedicated for is to worship Him is to express more of himself while the whole world is worshiping Satan we are worshiping the only one in living God why the whole world is manifesting expressing all the dirt that is in Satan the Bride of Jesus Christ expressing God in his entirety just like in the beginning does God change his mind about his word just like in the beginning it was not God's perfect will for children to be born on Earth through sex no sir God created Man Out of the Dust of the Earth breathe as the breath of life into him and he became a living Soul he did he took from that man a helpmate and made a wife to him that was God's first and original will can we say praise the Lord Hallelujah therefore all things that had a beginning has to have an end and all sin has to come to an inhalation and all sin has to be done away therefore in the great Millennium when the Resurrection comes we will not have to be reborn Again by our fathers or mothers but God like he did in the beginning will call men from the dust of the earth and his help made with him amen hallelujah what a great plan Church so it's behind all church is the father trying to reveal himself spoken word the original seat you ready fasten your seat belts please can get turbulent now if God said multiply to his pride to Adam's wife and replenish the Earth that was God's Commission when God gave a commission which cannot perish God's word is eternal cannot fail he said multiply and replenish the Earth that was God's Eternal purpose to carry that house you cannot die because it is his word you have to live if that child's been brought forth right there had been no death but she could not wait if that first child Abel would have come forth right there would be no death but it came wrong it came via sex that's why death came but it if that first child would come right there would be no death and if the first child would have come right the next child would have come right what would it be a further expression of God amen Abel was not just a copy of Adam but Abel was a further expression of God do you believe Abel was the son of God he was a further expression of God why Cain was the further expression of his father amen now speaking of Jesus Christ listen what brother random said Jesus Christ he was deceit that if should have produced do you get it he was deceit this would be the final outcome amen multiply and replenish finally she would have brought forth Jesus Christ all that Adam and Eve lost Christ died for and we are back to a church that's why all that God was now in the church waiting for manifestation are you ready for it Hallelujah this is God's great plan this is this is his great plan of worship to be worshiped so that he could express him in his entire form Eve should have done it but God allowed to fall so that he could show more of himself but if Eve would not have fallen if Eve would have bring forth the first child the right way not by sex but by the spoken word finally Jesus Christ will have come forth and if we are back to it you know what is coming forth through the Bride of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily can we say praise the Lord What a Mighty plan God has what a plan is in his mind I'm sorry it's maybe a little bit struck up but I trust you see what God's plan really was and I understand how Satan is trying to interrupt that because he don't want the church to get to the true revelation because if the church wants gets a true revelation of the two Spirits working the spirit of God and the Antichrist spirit she's in she's an infancy she's an invincible Army nope nothing can defeated she will bring forth Jesus Christ because all that God was now in the church can we say praise the Lord Hallelujah amen I'm really wondering if I would should continue as time went on you know after the fall finally we can see another step that God is taking in his plan and in his purpose in his Redemption we we find out then in Exodus 25 verse 8. that God again is looking at it and God is trying to show things now and he is telling Moses finally in Exodus 28 you just please make me a tabernacle I won't have a tabernacle because it says in Genesis in Exodus 25 8 make me a tabernacle make them a tabernacle so that I may dwell amongst them Hallelujah that I can live amongst them so that dwell means in Hebrews to settle to abide to establish to lay an intimate relationship God Desiring a place for worship with the people and then we can read sorry when I when I go a little bit the step just showing you just showing us how God always desired to have a place to worship and we his skin is coming from the Garden of Eden how he is going down then to Exodus 25 with the Tabernacle and he has and finally he comes he comes David Here Comes David and he said to the Lord and you know by the way as the Tabernacle was finally what what Moses Moses was caught up into heaven is that right to see what the Tabernacle should be and when he came down to earth he just the first thing he expressed was the tabernacle and because of the circumstances it was a moving Tabernacle amen amen the first materialization of what what he saw in heaven was a moving Tabernacle what do we see today what do we see today not a static Tabernacle we see a moving Tabernacle Hallelujah a moving Mercy Seat not a static Mercy Seat a moving Mercy Seat what do we see today a moving Mercy Seat where's the mercy today in the hearts of his people then we see then finally David had to desire said it is not good that I dwell in the temple I dwell in a nice palace and you just live in tents second Samuel we can read it and then God said no no it's it's fine he said to David it's fine he said uh you know you cannot do that your son son Solomon will do that he will make me a tabernacle amen he will make me a tabernacle and he builded that wonderful Tabernacle that we have read in second chronicles he builded the Tabernacle where the presence of the Lord came down filled the place but after a Time the Tabernacle was destroyed what has got in his mind what has got in his mind all the time expression expression expression just want to express more of him just wanted to express more of him like he wants to do this evening he is allowing circumstances the first temple was destroyed amen and then they came to the rebuilding of the Temple it went on you understand it went on Temple was destroyed Babylon then the group came out of Babylon and then they rebuilded the temple why we go why we would go to the scripture we find out the rebuilded temple that the people saw and the people were so frustrated about what they saw in the rebuilding and God said through his prophet higai he said the second temple it's Beauty it's greater than the beauty of the first temple that great church of Pentecost can we say praise the Lord Hallelujah can we say Amen Hallelujah God is speaking about you that great church of Pentecost a type of that Temple that Solomon built that great church of Pentecost full of the Holy Ghost fell through the Dark Ages now it's coming back in its beauty out of Babylon the group comes rebuilding the temple amen and the temple in his outshine that you know that many things of the temple was destroyed it did not look like the first one and the people get so frustrated about and this is how the people are frustrated today when the Sea of the church has said hey it is not like it's supposed to be and God sends a prophet God said the prophet hege and he told the people God God told him tell my people this the beauty of the second temple is greater than the beauty of the first because through the second temple I can express more of myself the church that is here that is there today the beauty of it is greater then of the first church of Pentecost because this church is expressing more of God can we believe that wonderful God we serve you are wonderful people just to absorb that word it is not my word is this is what the prophet said Hallelujah amen and as as we walk our way as we walk our path I just feel the Holy Spirit moving in such a deep into such a mighty way Hallelujah and as we understood this bride this Eve will not fall like the first one finally all expression are done now this bride this church will not fall again but this church will be the final expression of Jesus Christ of the almighty God in his entire fullness God bless you I just feel to stop let us pray together may we stand together the heavenly father that's why we are here dedicated to worship Dedicated To Worship the almighty God and all that

of the enemy you know I don't mean to take more time but we went to a Jewish Seder this last week and the rabbi that was doing the Seder he uh he was saying in Israel and in Old Israel Whenever there was a marriage to take place he said the father would send the son away to go prepare a place and he says no matter how bad that son wanted to get married it wasn't up to the Sun to say I'm ready he
