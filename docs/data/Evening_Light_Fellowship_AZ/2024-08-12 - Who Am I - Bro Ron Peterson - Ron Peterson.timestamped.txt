[42:48] well you know Sister Janet and I we were
[42:53] going back and
[42:54] forth and uh I said sister Jan you know
[42:58] a life

[43:03] preached because it is your life that
[43:06] people look
[43:07] at oh you can preach a lot you can say a
[43:11] lot but it's the life you
[43:13] live and Lord let our lives be a
[43:17] reflection of
[43:20] you that they don't see us that they see
[43:24] our Lord
[43:25] Jesus amen God bless you let's remain
[43:29] standing turn with me to the Book of
[43:31] Exodus Exodus chapter
[43:34] 3
[43:36] verses 1-
[43:39] 11 thank you Lord how many of you
[43:42] believe we're in another
[43:47] Exodus praise the Lord don't you just
[43:51] love to read his word
[43:53] amen his word is a lamp unto our feet
[43:57] it is a compass it is a guide it tells
[44:01] things that have been and shows us
[44:04] things that will
[44:06] be Exodus 3 and verse one the Bible says
[44:09] now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his
[44:12] father-in-law the priest of
[44:15] Midian and he led the flock to the
[44:17] backside of the desert and came to the
[44:19] Mountain of God even to horb
[44:30] and the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[44:33] him in a flame of fire out of the midst
[44:36] of a bush and he looked and behold the
[44:40] bush burned with fire and the Bush was
[44:42] not
[44:44] consumed and Moses said I will now turn
[44:47] aside and see this great sight why the
[44:50] bush is not
[44:52] burnt and when the Lord saw he turned
[44:56] aside to
[44:58] see God called unto him out of the midst
[45:02] of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he
[45:06] said here am
[45:08] I he said draw
[45:11] not draw not nigh hither but put off thy
[45:16] shoes from off thy feet for the place
[45:19] wherein thou standest is Holy Ground
[45:23] moreover he said I am the god of thy
[45:25] father the god God of Abraham the god of
[45:29] Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid
[45:33] his face for he was afraid to look upon
[45:36] God and the Lord said I have surely seen
[45:40] the Affliction of my people which are in
[45:42] Egypt and have heard of their Cry by
[45:45] reason of their
[45:46] taskmasters for I know their
[45:50] sorrows and I am come down to deliver
[45:53] them out of the hand of the Egyptians
[45:56] and to bring them out of the land unto a
[45:58] good land and a large and a land flowing
[46:01] with milk and honey and the place of the
[46:04] Canaanites and the Hittites and the
[46:06] amorites and the perizzites and the
[46:09] hivites and the
[46:10] jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry
[46:13] of the children of Israel has come unto
[46:16] me and I have also seen the oppression
[46:20] wherewith the
[46:21] Egyptians oppressed
[46:23] them come now therefore and I will send
[46:26] the thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest
[46:29] bring forth my people the children of
[46:32] Israel out of
[46:42] Egypt and Moses said unto
[46:46] God who am
[46:51] I wow than Lord burning bush
[46:58] Angels Supernatural events
[47:01] happening you said Lord you're coming
[47:04] down to deliver your
[47:07] people but I'm going to send you who who
[47:10] am
[47:13] I that I should go into
[47:17] pharaoh and that I should bring forth
[47:19] the children of Israel out of Egypt may
[47:23] God add the blessing the reading of his
[47:25] word you may be seated this morning in
[47:28] the presence of
[47:32] God I would like to title my sermon this
[47:37] morning who am
[47:41] I and I want to take as a subject as the
[47:45] Discerning of
[47:50] yourself and I want to share this
[47:52] morning just uh it's going to go in a
[47:55] couple directions but but we pray that
[47:57] the holy spirit will bring this
[48:00] together uh towards the end and you'll
[48:03] see the thought that God has been
[48:05] dealing with me on there's two things I
[48:09] want you to discern your
[48:13] life I want a selfawareness of
[48:18] yourself of who you
[48:23] are and then I want you to recognize
[48:27] then who you are because when you know
[48:29] who you are you take your
[48:35] position you know I'm really amazed uh
[48:38] many times at how people discern
[48:40] everybody
[48:43] else hey you see what's wrong with that
[48:46] family you see that church over there
[48:48] you see that guy hey if you know and and
[48:51] we criticize and we critique everyone
[48:54] you know have you seen how their
[48:56] children Act well they're a bunch of
[48:58] brats and uh you know have you looked at
[49:01] your
[49:02] kids what about your
[49:05] home I remember you know I had gotten
[49:09] married and we had a couple kids already
[49:12] and my brother was having to take care
[49:15] of my kids just for while sy's in the
[49:18] hospital and I went and I think it was
[49:20] birth of Matthew or whatever and so
[49:25] anyway the kids you know they even
[49:28] though he looks like me you know my
[49:30] daughter you know she stood
[49:33] up my brother said it's time for you
[49:35] guys to go to bed you ain't my
[49:42] daddy and anyway they had a little thing
[49:46] there a little opposition well finally
[49:48] you know yeah but you're going to go to
[49:50] bed anyway they went to bed my brother
[49:53] said look man when I have kids my kids
[49:57] are going to tow the line buddy I tell
[50:00] you they're going to March around like
[50:01] little military men you know they're
[50:04] going to do everything they're I'm going
[50:05] to make them do it and everything well
[50:08] when they had kids it's just the
[50:12] opposite so it's really amazing how we
[50:15] can really discern others can't we we
[50:17] can man we can see what's wrong with
[50:20] everybody else's kids with their family
[50:22] with what every other church but can we
[50:26] discern our
[50:28] self we don't tend to see our own
[50:33] flaws do
[50:35] we no
[50:38] no when we look in the mirror what's
[50:40] really amazing is when we look in the
[50:42] mirror we're so used to looking in the
[50:44] mirror of
[50:46] ourselves and it's a just a one-sided
[50:49] mirror and it's this and that and you've
[50:51] seen
[50:52] yourself a million times but you you
[50:56] don't really look that bad you just
[51:01] tend you know and
[51:04] you and the other day I was in our
[51:09] master bathroom there and I was looking
[51:11] in a mirror and we have a mirror on a
[51:15] wall and I happened to be look and I
[51:17] caught a different
[51:21] angle my
[51:25] goodness if it was
[51:29] startling and I thought oh my I need
[51:33] some work I I need to do a few things
[51:36] but I want to show you the difference
[51:38] between a mirror and a picture because a
[51:39] mirror is one way you look at it you see
[51:42] it all the time you don't seem to be so
[51:44] bad but really my being a photographer
[51:46] and I did that in high school and I
[51:49] could relate to to brother Dave and
[51:52] brother Richard and have photography and
[51:54] you take pictures and then you show you
[51:57] know what's amazing nobody wants their
[51:58] picture taken but after it's taken they
[52:01] want to see thems oh let me see oh oh
[52:04] and then there's sometimes that you have
[52:06] the photo and they look at it and they
[52:08] say do I look
[52:11] oh do I really look that bad well the
[52:14] difference between a mirror and a
[52:15] picture a picture is more of the reality
[52:18] of what you look like than it uh than
[52:21] the mirror because in the mirror you
[52:23] fool
[52:24] yourself you look at it and you think
[52:27] I'm not so bad cuz it's a one-sided
[52:30] self-image of yourself and really uh so
[52:34] it's amazing how someone can act and
[52:38] talk so
[52:41] spiritual yet they're blinded to discern
[52:44] their s and really on how they're
[52:46] living be so hard on others and miss it
[52:49] on them
[52:52] themselves and so
[52:54] I and I don't want to overplay this
[52:58] Viewpoint this morning because I want to
[53:00] come to another Point
[53:03] here and
[53:06] uh also I wanted to just say something
[53:09] here for a moment because I've heard a
[53:12] little something a little rumor within
[53:15] the church and it's come to me a couple
[53:17] times of some of you sisters that speak
[53:21] uh not so nicely of your husband
[53:28] don't do
[53:30] that remember you married that
[53:32] guy how's it make you look it's
[53:36] like so say good
[53:39] things okay don't you
[53:42] ever be degrade him or whatever belittle
[53:46] him in any way no because you know what
[53:49] listen uh he's your husband protect him
[53:53] he's got
[53:54] faults he may not know it but he does
[53:57] have
[53:58] faults and I'm sure that through a few
[54:02] years you will help him see his
[54:08] faults that's why you have a
[54:10] wife and uh so anyway the Lord help us
[54:15] and please um be careful and that goes
[54:19] with the husband to the wife or the wife
[54:22] to the husband say good things about one
[54:25] another you know so much of the time we
[54:27] can see what's wrong with everybody else
[54:30] but how is it that we are blinded
[54:32] sometimes to discern
[54:36] ourselves we're blinded to ourselves and
[54:39] our own faults and failures so much of
[54:41] the
[54:42] time and if we're care we're not careful
[54:45] what happens we get festical religion in
[54:48] other words we look at everybody like a
[54:50] fery h I'm glad I'm not like so and so
[54:55] I'm glad I'm not like him because we
[54:57] measure ourselves by ourselves and when
[54:59] you do
[55:01] you're it's not
[55:03] wise we may you want to measure yourself
[55:07] measure yourself up to the word of
[55:09] God Amen then you'll find out that we
[55:12] all fall short then we all cry Grace
[55:14] then we all say oh lord it's just you
[55:17] I'm only going to make it because of you
[55:19] and we won't get this stuffed arrogant
[55:22] uh attitude about ourselves and looks uh
[55:26] uh and get some self-righteous way about
[55:28] ourselves but hey but for the grace of
[55:31] God there go
[55:34] I in Luke
[55:36] 18 veres
[55:40] 9-14 Jesus had been speaking some
[55:43] Parables and he spake a parable unto
[55:45] certain which trusted in themselves that
[55:48] they were
[55:50] righteous and despise others something's
[55:52] wrong with this picture buddy
[55:57] when they trusted in themselves they
[55:59] were
[56:00] righteous and looked down and despised
[56:05] others and two men went up to the temple
[56:08] to pray the one a
[56:11] Pharisee the other a Publican and a
[56:15] Pharisee stood and prayed thus with
[56:17] himself God I thank thee that I am not
[56:19] as other men are
[56:22] extortioners unjust adulterers and even
[56:25] as this
[56:27] Publican I fast twice in a week I give
[56:30] tithes of all that I possess and the
[56:33] publicans standing a far off would not
[56:36] lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven
[56:39] but smokee his breath saying God be
[56:42] merciful to me a sinner and I tell you
[56:46] this man went down to his house
[56:49] Justified rather than the other for
[56:52] everyone that exalteth himself shall be
[56:54] a based and he he that hum humble him
[56:58] self shall be
[57:00] exalted God help us that we don't ever
[57:03] get some kind of self-righteous we're
[57:05] better than someone else type attitude
[57:08] somebody say Amen am take off your Halo
[57:11] this morning and let's be
[57:13] real
[57:15] amen Christians aren't perfect they're
[57:19] just
[57:20] forgiven amen if we have any Perfection
[57:23] it's in
[57:24] Christ amen thank you
[57:27] Lord It's not the way of our dress it's
[57:30] not the way we Act and the things we do
[57:33] but it's by faith in God and that is a
[57:37] gift of God lest any man should boast
[57:40] thank God for Faith it is a gift
[57:44] amen I'll show you another portion of
[57:47] this in Matthew 7:
[57:49] 1-5 judge not that you be not
[57:53] judged for with what judgment you judge
[57:56] you shall be
[57:58] judged and with what measure you meet it
[58:00] shall be measured to you
[58:02] again and why beholdest thou the moat in
[58:05] thy brother's eye but considerest not
[58:07] the
[58:08] beam that is in thine own eye and I
[58:11] looked at the beam and the moat and one
[58:14] is a little speck of sawdust and the
[58:16] other is a
[58:20] log so here is this
[58:24] graphic this description
[58:28] here why beholdest thou the moat this
[58:31] little this little sliver that's in your
[58:34] brother's eye but considerest not the
[58:36] beam that is in thine own
[58:40] eye or how will thou say to thy brother
[58:43] let me pull out the mo out of thine eye
[58:45] and behold a beam is in thine own
[58:47] eye thou hypocrite cast first out the
[58:50] beam out of thine own
[58:52] eye then Thou shalt See Clearly to cast
[58:55] out the most out of thy brother's eye
[58:58] show you another portion of scripture
[59:01] here in Luke 6:
[59:03] 41-42 and why beholdest the moat that's
[59:06] in thy brother's eye but perceivest not
[59:09] I want you to look and see that one it
[59:12] is perceiving and Discerning everybody
[59:15] else but doesn't perceive
[59:17] himself how sad wouldn't it be a
[59:21] terrible thing to be a Christian have a
[59:23] self-righteous attitude and look down
[59:25] and despise
[59:26] others when Hey where's the love of God
[59:30] in our hearts what about fellowshipping
[59:32] what about
[59:39] huh and but perceivest not the beam
[59:42] that's in thine own eye either how C
[59:44] thou say to thy brother brother let me
[59:47] pull out the moat that's in thine eye
[59:50] when thou thyself beholdest not the beam
[59:53] that is in thine own eye thou hypocrite
[59:56] cast out first The Beam out of thine own
[59:58] eye and then Thou shalt clearly pull out
[1:00:02] the moat that is in thy brother's eyes
[1:00:05] see if we would discern
[1:00:08] ourselves we're so busy being Discerning
[1:00:12] of others and critical of others and
[1:00:15] criticize
[1:00:17] others that sometimes we can't see the
[1:00:20] forest for the
[1:00:24] trees talk about somebody else's family
[1:00:27] well what about
[1:00:30] yours
[1:00:31] amen I'm just kind of talking down home
[1:00:34] this morning help me Lord to
[1:00:42] just and I want to ask you this question
[1:00:45] because this is a major
[1:00:47] question because Moses asked God who am
[1:00:54] I have you ever asked yourself the
[1:00:57] question really who am I right because
[1:01:00] you got to know who you
[1:01:03] are in order to take your
[1:01:08] position in order to be a servant of God
[1:01:11] you need to know not only who listen to
[1:01:14] me right not just know who he is right
[1:01:20] but you got to know who you are I want
[1:01:23] all of you to understand you can be
[1:01:25] raised
[1:01:26] around the message you can hear and see
[1:01:30] all of the supernatural there can be
[1:01:32] Visions there can be the pillar of Fire
[1:01:35] coming all signs is Supernatural and you
[1:01:38] can say wow this is amazing but what's
[1:01:41] that got to do with
[1:01:45] you
[1:01:47] Thunders and Lightnings and voices and
[1:01:51] angels and
[1:01:53] appearing and things and signs and
[1:01:56] wonders happening all
[1:01:57] over but what about
[1:02:02] you who are you
[1:02:12] right in the sign the sign of this time
[1:02:15] in 63 brother brand there's not a person
[1:02:18] living but would like to look
[1:02:19] past the time the curtain and where did
[1:02:23] I come from
[1:02:26] who am I and where am I going three
[1:02:29] major
[1:02:31] questions and it doesn't come to you
[1:02:33] because you were raised around the
[1:02:36] message you were raised in a Christian
[1:02:38] Church you were raised in a message
[1:02:41] home because you can have all of those
[1:02:45] lined up and still not have your
[1:02:47] identity you need to know who you are is
[1:02:50] this message for you you got to wrestle
[1:02:53] with the angel yourself you can't get up
[1:02:55] here and get a blessing and say I'm
[1:02:57] going to live off of that blessing you
[1:02:59] need to have the solid Revelation and
[1:03:02] the foundation that is laid only upon
[1:03:06] Him
[1:03:10] hallu amen thank you Lord who are
[1:03:14] you where' you come from why are you
[1:03:17] here for what purpose do you have here
[1:03:19] in life right of all the fine books
[1:03:22] that's read the Great Master selections
[1:03:25] that's been may there's only one book
[1:03:27] that reveals who you are and where you
[1:03:29] come from and where you going right
[1:03:32] that's it that's it it also lets us look
[1:03:37] past the curtain to see it your true
[1:03:40] identity does not come to you from your
[1:03:43] natural birth your true identity does
[1:03:46] not come to you through your natural
[1:03:50] parents it com to you with the new birth
[1:03:53] experience coming from God your
[1:03:56] father because a carnally minded man is
[1:03:59] enity with God and neither can he not
[1:04:02] understand the things of God for they
[1:04:05] are blinded to the things of God does
[1:04:08] not the Bible says that the God of this
[1:04:10] world hath blinded the eyes and the
[1:04:13] minds of them that believe not I ask you
[1:04:16] what kind of person are you why do you
[1:04:18] believe what you
[1:04:21] believe what's all of this got to do
[1:04:23] with you seven angels seven Thunders
[1:04:25] Seven
[1:04:27] Seals so
[1:04:30] what I ask you who are you what kind of
[1:04:35] lineage you come
[1:04:37] from what does this got to do with
[1:04:40] you I don't want you to make this some
[1:04:43] kind of
[1:04:44] religion I don't want you to make it
[1:04:47] some kind of way of life you could
[1:04:49] become a an
[1:04:50] Amish you could become a
[1:04:53] menite you can change your church
[1:04:56] and I'll tell you what a life lived is
[1:04:59] better than a preached sermon God let us
[1:05:02] live a life that others around us will
[1:05:04] want what we
[1:05:05] [Applause]
[1:05:08] got
[1:05:10] amen let us have the spirit of Christ
[1:05:16] amen you cannot come to your true
[1:05:19] adoption and placing in the body until
[1:05:22] you know who you are
[1:05:26] let me emphasize
[1:05:27] this when you know who you are then you
[1:05:30] can be positionally placed within the
[1:05:32] body because a doubl minded man the
[1:05:34] Bible says is unstable in all his
[1:05:38] ways who are
[1:05:42] you ask yourself that
[1:05:47] question you may know about God
[1:05:52] intellectually you may you may talk
[1:05:54] about his greatness
[1:05:56] you may have studied his word like a
[1:05:59] Pharisee and it just became a
[1:06:03] religion there are millions of people
[1:06:05] today around the world that say they
[1:06:07] know Jesus and how that they love
[1:06:10] him many will honor God with their lips
[1:06:13] but the Bible says their hearts are far
[1:06:15] from him in vain do they worship him
[1:06:19] it's not just confessing to know
[1:06:23] him let me emphasize this it's knowing
[1:06:26] who you are
[1:06:30] am many people say oh yeah yeah I know
[1:06:34] Jesus and you live like you don't know
[1:06:41] him Jesus said if you love
[1:06:45] me you keep my
[1:06:48] Commandments we do not do his
[1:06:52] Commandments to have eternal life we do

[1:09:34] the
[1:09:35] message it is the same with the Bible
[1:09:39] otherwise everyone who owns the Bible
[1:09:41] can understand the mystery of God and
[1:09:44] understand God himself but I'll tell you
[1:09:47] it is a hidden book it's a sealed book
[1:09:50] it is only it is only given the
[1:09:54] deciphering of of the mystery to those
[1:09:57] who are elect am so I ask you who are
[1:10:01] you you must be some kind of special
[1:10:04] people if God if you're catching
[1:10:08] anything in this end time now about what
[1:10:11] God is doing in this
[1:10:13] hour oh quit talking about Jesus 2,000
[1:10:17] years ago quit talking about way back a
[1:10:20] god of History the one thing about this
[1:10:23] message has brought God out of history
[1:10:26] right down today he is the same
[1:10:28] yesterday today and forever because if
[1:10:31] God ever did something way back then you
[1:10:34] watch you come under the same condition
[1:10:36] and watch that God do it
[1:10:39] [Applause]
[1:10:40] again he's the same yesterday today and
[1:10:48] forever you don't know God by mere
[1:10:50] studying your
[1:10:52] Bible you don't know God by human and
[1:10:55] intellectual
[1:10:57] reasoning you don't know God because
[1:10:59] some man taught you from some kind of
[1:11:02] Seminary or theological
[1:11:04] teaching you know God because your
[1:11:07] Father revealed himself to you amen yes
[1:11:11] sir brother Brenham said in is this the
[1:11:13] sign of the end sir just hit some
[1:11:16] highlighted portions here in Matthew 13
[1:11:20] in the 11th verse he answered and said
[1:11:23] to them because it's given to you his
[1:11:26] disciples given to you to know the
[1:11:28] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[1:11:31] not to
[1:11:34] them to them it's not
[1:11:38] given and the Mysteries here the
[1:11:41] mystery a mystery in
[1:11:43] scripture is a previously hidden truth
[1:11:47] now divinely revealed but
[1:11:50] which is
[1:11:52] a supernatural element still remains
[1:11:56] despite the
[1:11:57] Revelation let me say this we have got a
[1:12:02] message of the
[1:12:05] hour and we have got books and
[1:12:08] tapes of many of the things that has
[1:12:11] been done in this hour supernatural
[1:12:14] angels I don't need to go on and expound
[1:12:17] on that you know what I'm talking
[1:12:20] about but there is a supernatural
[1:12:22] element that remains despite
[1:12:25] the message or the revelation of God and
[1:12:29] that means that each one of you a
[1:12:31] supernatural element God needs to move
[1:12:34] upon you yes you you need to find out
[1:12:38] what is this message is it for
[1:12:42] you cuz I have some that sit there and
[1:12:45] they well I don't know I've just been
[1:12:47] raised around I really don't know well

[1:12:54] soon there's becoming a Rapture of the
[1:12:56] church and God's going to take his bride
[1:12:58] away and the foolish virgin's going to
[1:13:01] get left and for three and a half years
[1:13:04] of a
[1:13:05] tribulation it's going to be hell on
[1:13:08] Earth oh God help us to know who you are

[1:17:56] element into your life it'll change
[1:18:00] you yeah it'll stimulate you
[1:18:05] amen begin to see the evolution of God
[1:18:08] brother random said God's an
[1:18:10] evolutionist he believes in evolution he
[1:18:12] said not the way science teaches it not
[1:18:15] the way Darwin teaches it but he said
[1:18:17] watch God in his great Evolution he said
[1:18:21] there he was he wasn't even God he was
[1:18:24] just a spirit he dwelt alone in
[1:18:28] eternity and he said there in the womb
[1:18:31] of his mind where God creates cuz that's
[1:18:34] the Inception place and so he began to
[1:18:38] create in his mind and he wanted to be a
[1:18:41] savior wanted to be a
[1:18:44] redeemer all of these thoughts he wanted
[1:18:47] to have a family he wanted to have
[1:18:50] children he wanted to reveal himself and
[1:18:53] he began in his mind and he began to
[1:18:57] evolve and he said and then the logos
[1:19:01] came out of the very Mind Of God which
[1:19:04] is the thought of God and the Loos
[1:19:08] became
[1:19:09] flesh amen and the word became flesh and
[1:19:13] dwelt Among Us God who was a spirit who
[1:19:17] we cannot understand and we can't relate
[1:19:20] to because it's a spirit how can I love
[1:19:23] something I can't see
[1:19:25] how can I love a God I don't understand
[1:19:29] so he said I will evolve myself down I
[1:19:32] will make
[1:19:34] myself visible I will come down and I
[1:19:37] will make myself known to you and you
[1:19:40] shall see me with your hands with your
[1:19:42] eyes you'll feel me with your hands you
[1:19:45] will know that I am
[1:19:48] he
[1:19:50] Hallelujah the evolution of God see the
[1:19:53] prophet says I believe in evolution but
[1:19:55] not the way the modern scientists
[1:19:58] say God evolving himself
[1:20:04] down and so God here it is in the
[1:20:07] invisible Union of the bride of
[1:20:11] Christ follow along with me and so God
[1:20:15] manifested in the beginning finally he
[1:20:19] appeared as
[1:20:21] Jehovah God the Father then he appeared
[1:20:24] as God the son in Jesus Christ now he's
[1:20:28] appeared as God the Holy Ghost the same
[1:20:30] God all the same three manifestations of
[1:20:34] the same God not three different gods
[1:20:38] same God just like Evolution come he
[1:20:42] created body life first then he created
[1:20:44] animal life next then he created human
[1:20:47] life next kind of an evolution Rising
[1:20:51] higher so it has been in God and his
[1:20:54] church now he's taken the very thing
[1:20:56] that he said Evolution and it started
[1:20:58] with boty
[1:21:01] life and then it goes the animal life
[1:21:04] and then fining to the image of God God
[1:21:12] evolving it's the evolution of
[1:21:20] God so it's been God in his church
[1:21:23] justification under Luther watch God
[1:21:25] he's
[1:21:26] evolving he's bringing the church higher
[1:21:29] he goes to
[1:21:31] Luther H pulling the bride out follow
[1:21:35] along he's creating bride justification
[1:21:39] under Luther sanctification under Wesley
[1:21:42] so forth you see the evolution of the
[1:21:44] spirit being given more and more because
[1:21:48] the body is building coming to the head
[1:21:50] which is Christ the body of Christ
[1:21:56] because Christ is the mystery of God
[1:22:00] revealed Eve was the mystery of Adam
[1:22:05] revealed and the bride of Christ is now
[1:22:09] the mystery of Christ
[1:22:11] reveal sir
[1:22:14] amen thank you Lord who are you
[1:22:26] ask yourself who am
[1:22:33] I it's all part of the evolution of
[1:22:39] God God condenscending
[1:22:43] down God is a
[1:22:46] spirit in the sermon who is this Mount
[1:22:50] kzdc it's like a sculptor takes his PE
[1:22:54] piece of work all covered over until the
[1:22:57] time he takes the mask off it and there
[1:23:00] it
[1:23:02] is that's what the Bible has been it's
[1:23:05] been the work of God that's been covered
[1:23:07] up it's been hid since the foundation of
[1:23:10] the world and it's Sevenfold mystery and
[1:23:14] God promised in this day at the age of
[1:23:17] this Lan
[1:23:18] church he would take the mask off the
[1:23:22] whole thing that we could see it what a
[1:23:25] glorious
[1:23:27] thing God in
[1:23:29] morpha masted in the pillar of fire god
[1:23:33] in morpa in a man called Jesus God in
[1:23:37] morpa in his
[1:23:39] church God above us God With Us God in
[1:23:42] us God you see the condenscending of
[1:23:47] God up there holy no one could touch him
[1:23:51] he settled upon the mountain even if an
[1:23:53] animal touch touch the mountain he had
[1:23:55] to die and God come down changed his
[1:23:58] tent come down lived with us and become
[1:24:00] one of us and we beheld him the Bible
[1:24:02] said 1 Timothy 3:16 without controversy
[1:24:05] great is the mystery of godliness for
[1:24:08] God was manifested in the flesh handled
[1:24:11] with hands God eat meat God drank water
[1:24:14] God slept God cried he was one of us
[1:24:16] beautiful typed in the Bible but God was
[1:24:19] above us God was with us now it's God in
[1:24:22] us the Holy Spirit
[1:24:25] Hallelujah are you seeing the
[1:24:26] condenscending of God this is God
[1:24:29] evolving what is he doing he's cloning
[1:24:33] [Applause]
[1:24:38] himself therefore who are
[1:24:44] you what manner of man and woman are you
[1:24:50] right
[1:24:56] he commanded the wind the
[1:24:58] waves he calmed the storms and the
[1:25:01] disciples said what manner of
[1:25:04] man is
[1:25:07] this I want to ask you what kind of
[1:25:09] manner woman are
[1:25:15] you let us sink very
[1:25:20] deeply God is the spirit and the word
[1:25:23] became flesh we know know
[1:25:25] that God became man the spirit of God
[1:25:28] went from the body of Jesus Christ at
[1:25:33] Calvary he gave up The Ghost and he said
[1:25:37] it is finished and he bowed his
[1:25:42] head the
[1:25:44] newas the Breath of God
[1:25:47] left but what it did it just transferred
[1:25:51] to another body
[1:25:54] it went from a one one membered body to
[1:25:57] a multi-member body the body brother
[1:25:59] renham called the mystical body of Jesus
[1:26:01] Christ because his holy spirit amen will
[1:26:05] only enter into his
[1:26:07] body not another body his body it'll be
[1:26:11] bone of his bone it'll be flesh of his
[1:26:13] flesh as Eve was a part of Adam so is
[1:26:17] the bride a part of the word it's a word
[1:26:20] birth
[1:26:30] Hallelujah not another body his
[1:26:35] body evolution of
[1:26:41] God
[1:26:43] God In His Infinite Mercy placed within
[1:26:47] you a seed
[1:26:51] Gene and you either have it or you
[1:26:56] [Music]
[1:26:59] don't you don't talk somebody into
[1:27:02] it going to church doesn't change him
[1:27:06] because Genesis 1:1 says every seed will
[1:27:10] bring forth of its own kind do you
[1:27:15] understand that that is a law of
[1:27:20] God so I ask you
[1:27:27] if God were to have a son or a
[1:27:29] daughter what would they be
[1:27:35] like who am
[1:27:38] I is this message just rules and
[1:27:41] regulations to you or is it your
[1:27:49] identity
[1:27:52] Hallelujah brother said in samian church
[1:27:55] age Son of God can go a long time before
[1:27:58] he recognizes he is a
[1:28:02] son some of you are
[1:28:06] slow excuse me but it's true and any
[1:28:10] teacher that's got a classroom full of
[1:28:12] kids some kids catch it before the
[1:28:16] others it's all right just a fact of
[1:28:21] life Son of God
[1:28:24] can go a long time that mean you can be
[1:28:26] raised up around the message you can be
[1:28:29] raised up and parents telling you and
[1:28:32] hey it it happened with
[1:28:34] Jacob Abraham Isaac and Jacob and he
[1:28:38] hears all the stories but G guess what
[1:28:41] all of these are just stories to Jacob
[1:28:44] the Bible says and when Jacob was left
[1:28:47] alone think of that when Jacob was left
[1:28:50] alone sometimes that's the best thing
[1:28:52] that can happen to any one of you is
[1:28:54] when there's no friends there's no
[1:28:56] family there's no this and that and
[1:28:58] you're left alone and all of a
[1:29:01] sudden God gets all of
[1:29:03] you sir take a long time to recognize
[1:29:07] who you
[1:29:09] are in fact a lot of true Christians are
[1:29:12] like the story of the baby eagle hatched
[1:29:14] out under a
[1:29:16] h you know that eagle is the type of the
[1:29:19] True Believer somebody say amen
[1:29:22] amen farmer took an egg from an eagle's
[1:29:25] nest placed it under a hen do time all
[1:29:27] the eggs under the hen hatched out the
[1:29:30] baby chicks got out got along fine with
[1:29:34] the mother hand but that little Eagle
[1:29:36] could not figure out all the clucking
[1:29:38] and scratching for food in the manure po
[1:29:41] huh he managed to make a living but he
[1:29:44] was pretty confused about it all I can
[1:29:47] say Amen to that but one day from way up
[1:29:51] in the air the mother Eagle had laid the
[1:29:54] eggs spy that little Eagle on the ground
[1:29:57] she swooped down with her tremendous
[1:29:59] speed and screamed at the top of her
[1:30:01] voice for him to fly up to meet her you
[1:30:04] never heard an eagle cry but when he
[1:30:06] heard that first sermon something in him
[1:30:15] stirred sorry I make this
[1:30:19] personal and he longed to launch out
[1:30:22] toward it but he was afraid
[1:30:24] to try again the mother screamed for him
[1:30:26] to rise in the wind and follow her he
[1:30:29] screamed back that he was afraid once
[1:30:32] more she called out screaming that he
[1:30:34] tried beating his wings he hurled
[1:30:36] himself into the air and answering the
[1:30:38] Cry of his mother he soared off into the
[1:30:41] blue skies you see he always was an
[1:30:44] eagle he acted like a chicken for a
[1:30:46] little while but he could not be
[1:30:48] satisfied and when he heard the call of
[1:30:50] the Great Eagle he came to his own place
[1:30:53] he
[1:30:55] see a once a true Son of God hears the
[1:30:57] Cry of the Spirit by the word he too
[1:31:00] will realize who he is and run to the
[1:31:03] great
[1:31:11] prophet who am
[1:31:16] I why did just listening to a couple
[1:31:20] messages turn my life that's right
[1:31:26] around wasn't raised around it wasn't
[1:31:29] raised in church but all of a sudden
[1:31:32] when I heard the voice of that seventh
[1:31:34] angel when he began to sound there was
[1:31:37] something inside of me there was an
[1:31:39] identity that I'd never heard I saw a
[1:31:42] reflection I knew who I
[1:31:47] was that's what it's all
[1:31:51] about watch cuz the prophet had come to
[1:31:54] this Revelation too watch this yeah
[1:31:57] because you know what
[1:31:58] listen I remember I'm told on the day of
[1:32:01] my
[1:32:02] birth that there was an Amber of light
[1:32:04] that came in through the window and
[1:32:06] hovered over my the mother's bed there
[1:32:10] and he said there I was born and there
[1:32:11] were the Amber fire of God and all of
[1:32:15] this stuff and that the parents not
[1:32:17] being religious oh he said oh my they
[1:32:21] begin to wonder there's something
[1:32:22] special about this boy he says I begin
[1:32:25] to grow up I begin to hear voices I look
[1:32:28] up in a tree carrying water for my

[1:55:03] Saul therefore Saul removed him from him
[1:55:07] and made him a captain over a thousand
[1:55:09] and he went out and came in before the
[1:55:11] people and David behave behaved himself
[1:55:14] wisely in all his ways and the Lord was
[1:55:17] with him wherefore then Saul saw that he
[1:55:19] behaved himself very wisely he was
[1:55:21] afraid of of him but all Israel and
[1:55:24] Judah loved David because he went out
[1:55:26] and came in before them and saw see a
[1:55:29] life
[1:55:30] lived a life lived is better than a
[1:55:33] sermon
[1:55:35] preached that's why yesterday during the
[1:55:38] memorial service there was
[1:55:42] family that knew Dave way
[1:55:46] back there was
[1:55:48] something about his life
[1:55:53] wasn't he didn't sit there and explain
[1:55:54] to them the Seven
[1:55:58] Seals he lived
[1:56:01] aive and years later they come stand
[1:56:04] behind here I there was something about
[1:56:10] Dave I tell you I know what was about
[1:56:16] Dave Dave knew who he was he didn't care
[1:56:19] if anybody believed it or not he knew
[1:56:21] who he was
[1:56:22] was I ask you do you know who you
[1:56:27] are Saul said to to David verse 17
[1:56:31] behold my elder daughter
[1:56:34] Meb her will I give thee to wife only be
[1:56:38] thou Valiant for me and fight the Lord's
[1:56:40] battles for Saul said let not mine hand
[1:56:43] be upon him let the hand of the
[1:56:44] Philistines be in other words I'll put
[1:56:47] him out in
[1:56:48] battle he'll die by the hands of the
[1:56:51] Philistines I don't have to kill him
[1:56:53] he's God's
[1:56:54] anointed I'm afraid of him let let the
[1:56:57] Philistines do it and David said to
[1:57:01] Saul who am
[1:57:04] I what is my
[1:57:08] life or my family my father's family in
[1:57:13] Israel that I should be a son-in-law to
[1:57:16] the
[1:57:18] king

[1:57:26] I ask yourself that question this
[1:57:33] morning 1 Chronicles 29 I'm closing with
[1:57:36] this
[1:57:38] scripture wherefore D David blessed the
[1:57:41] Lord before all the
[1:57:43] congregation and said blessed be thou
[1:57:45] Lord God of Israel Our Father forever
[1:57:48] and ever thine oh Lord is the greatness
[1:57:52] and the power and the glory and the
[1:57:53] Victory and the Majesty for all that is
[1:57:56] in heaven and in the Earth are thine
[1:57:59] thine is the kingdom oh Lord Thou Art

[2:09:04] unto
[2:09:05] [Music]
[2:09:11] you come here
[2:09:15] sweetheart you know
[2:09:22] we've been uh through some
[2:09:27] trials the know Devil's stuck his head
[2:09:31] up I've been going through it with my
[2:09:34] wife but she wants to tell
[2:09:38] you present
[2:09:40] stage go ahead
[2:09:42] mil hold it up hold it up so they can
[2:09:45] hear first I thought I'd share this
[2:09:47] little thing with you is is it on test
[2:09:50] test there we go
[2:09:52] okay God bless everybody but I wanted to
[2:09:55] share with you actually Ron wanted me to
[2:09:57] go ahead and share it but when I um when
[2:10:00] I first um found out I had cancer and I
[2:10:05] laid my hand on myself and I
[2:10:10] re I rebuked the life out of the
[2:10:14] tumor and then an inspiration hit me and
[2:10:18] the Lord told me you go ahead and
[2:10:21] he just put it on my heart to go ahead
[2:10:23] and speak it and I
[2:10:26] said so then I
[2:10:28] rebuked I rebuked it might sound silly
[2:10:31] to you but I rebuked the life out in the
[2:10:34] name of Sandy
[2:10:37] Peterson and the and then it just came
[2:10:39] to me and the Lord showed me he said
[2:10:42] you've got the authority I I got and you
[2:10:46] know what I I just he said sign the
[2:10:49] check so I signed the check and I got to
[2:10:52] thinking like brother brandham he talks
[2:10:56] about the
[2:10:58] policeman and um well the policeman he's
[2:11:01] got the authority but he doesn't put up
[2:11:03] a sign as saying the name of Phoenix the
[2:11:05] City of Phoenix he just puts his hand up
[2:11:08] and um it's like if you I don't know if
[2:11:11] you've ever heard this on tape before
[2:11:13] but Ron and I've heard it where brother
[2:11:15] Brown's praying for people and sometimes
[2:11:17] he's like be healed and he goes to the
[2:11:20] next person and he never says in the
[2:11:23] name of Jesus Christ and I realized it's
[2:11:25] because the authority was there he knew
[2:11:28] who he was and you know and I thought to
[2:11:32] myself you know
[2:11:33] what I feel like when I think about the
[2:11:36] Lord you know you think a lot with your
[2:11:38] husband and you people say your
[2:11:39] soulmates but to me he's really my
[2:11:42] soulmate but anyways to get to the
[2:11:47] testimony so um anyway we talked to the
[2:11:50] doctor and you know the doctor and Ron
[2:11:54] decided the best thing for me was to
[2:11:55] have the surgery and have the tumor
[2:11:57] taken out so I did that and then the um
[2:12:02] pathology test came back and actually
[2:12:05] the lady called me and you know so they
[2:12:08] take lymph nodes and you know they
[2:12:11] actually call it a partial masectomy and
[2:12:14] um anyway it came back and she said this
[2:12:16] is what she said to me you're cancer
[2:12:19] free they found
[2:12:22] [Applause]
[2:12:28] so
[2:12:30] it's it's it's all glory to the Lord and
[2:12:34] um and It just fits with the
[2:12:36] surface and so you all know you can do
[2:12:39] the same
[2:12:40] thing but anyway I just want to tell you
[2:12:43] how much I love the Lord he means
[2:12:45] everything to me and I want to glorify
[2:12:48] him for his greatness am
[2:12:56] yeah
[2:12:58] yeah Sandy said honey you may think it's
[2:13:00] crazy but I I put my hand on myself and
[2:13:03] I said in the name of Sandy Peterson I
[2:13:06] curse this
[2:13:07] thing she says my name is as good as his
[2:13:11] on the
[2:13:13] check amen amen amen praise the Lord so
[2:13:18] you know listen we put all you know
[2:13:20] before before uh because when we found
[2:13:23] out the the cancer etc etc they said
[2:13:26] okay maybe 6 months of chemo and then so
[2:13:30] much of radiation and uh Sandy uh yeah
[2:13:34] and and so uh anyway uh Sandy said no
[2:13:39] I'm not doing none of that I'm going to
[2:13:41] trust God I'm going to believe what that
[2:13:44] well don't you understand no we need to
[2:13:47] we need to the chemotherapy we need to
[2:13:49] do this and we need to I we understand
[2:13:52] yeah we're not we're not doubting you're
[2:13:54] saying what you need to do and it's your
[2:13:57] business and everything but our business
[2:13:59] is to trust God and so we're just going
[2:14:01] to trust God and and so uh and you know

[2:22:22] if he calls on me I'm going to tell him
[2:22:24] tell the congregation what you put on my
[2:22:28] heart this morning I was up early
[2:22:30] praying and I said Lord what I just I
[2:22:34] couldn't pray I was just such a a
[2:22:37] tension such a pressure all around me
[2:22:39] this
[2:22:40] morning I thought well I'll just listen
[2:22:42] to a tape so I typed in 63 in the table
[2:22:45] and I'm thinking now what what message
[2:22:47] should I listen to this morning before I
[2:22:50] go to the
[2:22:51] church I came to the message why Christ
[2:23:02] speak brother vam gets up you know and
[2:23:04] he's he's reading he's talk talking
[2:23:06] about Moses he's being a perfect type of
[2:23:08] Christ and he's giving all of these
[2:23:10] examples and he just it just you know
[2:23:13] he's talking about a sister that just
[2:23:14] had a wreck a car wreck and there was a
[2:23:16] lot of things that that was on the
[2:23:18] prophet's mind and you know he was
[2:23:20] concerned about the people and their
[2:23:21] condition and the things that they're
[2:23:22] going through and he's mentioning all
[2:23:24] these things and he reads the scripture
[2:23:26] he's going through the things and then
[2:23:28] all of a sudden he started talking about
[2:23:30] what God did through his ministry and
[2:23:32] what he
[2:23:33] saw and I got to think you know that's
