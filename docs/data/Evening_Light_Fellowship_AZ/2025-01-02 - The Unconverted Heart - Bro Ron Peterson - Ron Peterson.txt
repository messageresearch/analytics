so and uh brother Mario you guys are heading to Hawaii tomorrow huh having the wedding what is it January 6th January 6th theth the 5th and Christine's getting married to Cedric so Lord bless them too Jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 9 and then we'll go to Proverbs 28 then we'll go to Acts chapter 7 Jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 9 the Bible says the heart is a is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it how many believe the Bible's true amen amen that's talking about the unconverted heart and how deceitful it is God turn me over to an evil spirit rather than to my own heart because I tell you what when you're turned over to your own heart you find out how deceitfully Wicked it is who can hear amen Proverbs chapter 28 if you would and I gave them verse 26 but we're going to back up to verse 25 he that is of a proud heart stirreth up Strife but he that putteth his trust in the Lord shall be made fat I'm doing pretty good on that one he that trust trusteth in his own heart is a fool but who so walketh wisely he shall be delivered amen don't ever trust in your own heart true we need God to help us don't we Acts chapter 7 please the brothers had actually spoke about building him a house last night acts 7: 47-52 but Solomon built him an house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me sayeth the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand man made all these things ye stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do ye which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them and showed be which shed before of the coming of the just one of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers amen may God add the blessing to the reading of his word you all may be seated tonight somebody say praise the Lord praise the Lord amen so like I said I'm just running a little bit if I was an 8 cylinder engine I've probably got two cylinders hitting right now so we'll try to get through this and everything but God is good amen amen and I'd like to talk about because we before we left we talked about that the healing the Brokenhearted and the subject of the heart is is an is actually an immense subject throughout scripture it's used well over 1300 times in the scriptures just talking about the heart and um so I want to speak tonight on the unconverted heart and I take the subject of the heart of the matter because really when we're having issues and if we're not serving the lord the heart of the matter is our heart God help it that our heart will be to the place that it should be that it wouldn't be calloused it wouldn't be hardened huh it wouldn't be slothful uh wouldn't be uncircumcised but it that it would be ready to hear the word of God and to do what God would have us to do now the Bible speaks so much about the heart and really today as I was studying there was three times that I woke up there at my desk and uh I had been studying and I was looking and I had been reading my Bible all of a sudden I don't know how long all of a sudden I wake up I don't know where I'm at it's like whoa and okay let's see I was studying on this and went back to study that happened three times and so um I didn't really have a chance to really uh go through it the way that I would like to but uh the Lord knows and so I have a few things here that uh the Lord's been dealing with me about a heart and uh you know there's so much that one could say about the heart and I I think saints of God we need to guard our hearts not only of the things that we uh we do and say around other people or the uh actions that we go through but also I believe that we should guard one another's heart there are times we say things out of either anger frustration some kind of human emotion where you're just fed up and and you say something and you hurt somebody has anybody ever experienced something like that where either you said it somebody else said it and once it's said you can't you can't take it back oh God keep us sensitive to your Holy Spirit guard our mouths the the tongue is a is an unruly member it says we put uh uh you know Helms on big old ships and make them go wherever we want them to go but he said no one's been able to to tame the tongue such an unruly member and what a great fire a small thing Kindle it and so God help us to watch our mouth to Bridle our mouths and be careful that we don't hurt one another and say things that we shouldn't in the time of frustration whatever amen the heart of man is a vast subject within the scriptures and as I had been studying it you can see there's so many conditions of the heart right and we can change our minds and we can change our surroundings but it will take an Act of God to change our heart amen and then we find out that when we speak from our mouth we're going to find out where it's coming from so turn with me if you would to Matthew 15 verses 18- 20 Matthew chapter 15 18 through 20 but those Saints which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man for out of the heart proceeds evil thoughts murderers adulteries fornications thefts false Witnesses and blasphemies look at this that come out of the mouth but where do they come from in the heart these are the things which defile a man but to eat with unwashed hands defileth not a man Mark 7 and verses 20- 23 and he said that which cometh out of the man that defileth that which cometh out of the man that defileth the man for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornication murderers thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness and evil eye blasphemy Pride foolishness all these things come from within and defile the man I would say then it's a pretty good thing that we need to know how we uh what is coming forth out of our heart Lord let me hide Thy word in my heart that I learn not to sin against you because look at all of this stuff that comes out of the heart murdering envidies blasphemies adulteries fornications you see if you're not guarding your heart from seeds of Discord from seeds of unbelief then what'll happen is pretty soon you'll start talking about it next thing it'll come forth it'll defile you Paul warned the Hebrews who were the Believers that they should not let themselves become hardened in their heart because the Bible says let not your heart become hardened as it was in the day of provocation so we look at that how can a heart become hardened brother Brenham says in the sermon spiritual Amnesia 1964 if one would come today like that it would be rejected just the same they had a b bad case of it speaking of Amnesia and so have they today they could not identify themselves with the supernatural things anymore because they didn't want it the word the gospel they didn't want it sin disease had affected them look at this now he's here's a prophet Discerning where it come from sin had affected them and they loved that sin is Pleasant to the unconverted heart it looks good to the unconverted mind it's the way of death there is nothing left but death the wages of sin is death it's so you must reap them wages you've swed to the winds and now reaping the Whirlwind amen the spiritual signs and the preaching of an ordained messenger from God never stirred them anymore the men could laugh right in their face and say I don't have to hear such a stuff as that if that hasn't repeated again what is it spiritual Amnesia exactly what it is they've forgotten that God and His word is the same and he cannot change it amen now remember I had talked on um healing the Brokenhearted and I took that as a subject in one of my sermons in Germany and there is a couple from um they're actually Filipino you you know them they they live in Italy their daughter is in nurse she works with some of the highest um uh heart doctors and cardiologists in Europe but especially right there in Italy and she came up to me and she says brother Ron she says I want you to know I work with some of the highest heart specialists here in Europe and she said and a doctor during the time of heart transplant if the the one who is having his heart transplanted into one who needs a new heart if he's ever been brokenhearted he'll never do the he'll never do the surgery he says because the broken heart has got scars and has got all kinds of things and it he said they just wouldn't do it I thought that was extremely uh interesting and she began to to tell me the terminology of what I said and how that uh uh uh a person could die actually of a brokenhearted she said oh that's medical uh definitions that is medical terminology and so I thought that very very interesting so it's important that we not only guard our own heart but we learn to guard the heart of others you know even brother Brenham said in the way that we chastise or correct our children if we do it in Anger he says even how the scripture says look you should uh have this discernment that the way that thou chastises their your children God will do that to you so God help us H to never chase and chastise correct our children in anger because generally you're doing it wrong and he says you grieve that angel that's around that CH and you grieve the Holy Spirit God help us huh we should correct with love there are many conditions of the heart that the Bible talks about I mentioned them earlier about the heart hardened heart about a clean heart about a pure heart how about an uncircumcised heart how about a forgiving heart for forgiveness is one of those things that comes from the heart when we say that we forgive someone it must come from the heart not from the head because you're you're just saying well I forgive you and you still have this animosity and some kind of resentment down inside and uh uh you know you might say something like well I forgive you but God's going to take you to task well hey you know what listen you let God you don't need to tell them that just tell them hey I I forgive you and forgiveness is one of the greatest acts that we can do of kindness and godliness while we're here on Earth to forgive someone and you know it's hard for us if you've been raised in a family where uh you ever had the the boys go to getting out of line and one comes by and socks the other one and so what he does the one that he hit the other one's got to hit him back harder and pretty soon it's it's a freefor all and uh sibling rivalry it's a terrible thing and uh you know you don't forgive and I hey you know yeah listen I forgive you but I don't forget well that's not a Godly attribute I thank God that he's got a sea of forgetfulness that he can drop all Hey listen if God can do that with us what about us being able to do it with others but because we're human ah we tend to to to not easily forget but God help us to forgive and forgive from the heart because if you don't you have animosities you have all kinds of things that come up that defile your spirit and you find out that you just you you become uh one of those it's a grumbling complaining nothing's never good nothing's never right and um that's just not the attributes of God right now when I began to think about the third pool and understand this because brother Brenham now comes into the changing of his ministry from first and second PLL from all of the evangelism and he comes into the third pole of his ministry he's up in Sabino Canyon excuse me he's praying about a vision that he's had that's a blast that he thinks he's going to die now you all know that he says I think you know God may be taking me off the scene I've told Billy ball instructed him uh look Billy I may not be coming home can you imagine the pressure he's got and uh so uh you all remember he's praying what does vision mean now what appeared in his hand sword a sword and a sword is likened unto the word of God which is a sharp two-edged sword yeah so God is now taking his ministry in the third pool is actually that Discerning ability to discern between the spirit and the soul and to actually cut it down he said you can have the Holy Spirit on your spirit you can speak in tongues shout Jump cast out devil you could do all this kind of stuff and on your way to hell and he says and and the the soul as black as night yeah God help us to not just have an anointing on the outer court or the inner Court without going to the holy of holies amen so we know the the Bible says in Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick so what's coming to the prophet up there in Sabino Canyon the word of the Lord remember the angel tells him this is the third pole didn't say this will be or there's coming no he said this is the third pole this is the Vindication of your ministry now stop here a second think of all of the thousands of people he's preached to it India and Africa and the great revivals that he's had he said this is the vindication of your ministry wow I thought God had already Vindicated him but the Vindication is that the word of God now is going to come and it's going to divide us under there from from your spirit and your soul and there's is where brother Brenham could preach on the sermon the anointed ones at the end time and I remember the first time ever hearing the anointed ones of the end time I thought it was the false anointed ones at the end time because he he States it kind of like that a few times he said no it's the genuine Holy Spirit even on false seed and he says and here they are doing all of these works and he says just to show you he says that you can have the spirit on your spirit activating gifts of the Spirit and your soul is on its way to hell it never the control room of giving your heart completely to God has not taken place oh God we need God to come in and sit on the control room of our heart all right Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing us under of Soul and Spirit so that the word of God is the only thing that can divide better than a laser or a scalpel or the sharpest thing that we have because now it's going to divide us under between the spirit and the soul and then joins in the marrow and the discerner now watch this is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so the word of God many times will come even while a minister is speaking and brother meno us ministers that have been behind the pulpit a few times and people say oh thank you so much for that sermon that really touched me oh and a lot of times we didn't know who it was for but we said it because we felt led to say it well what God was doing God in heaven was sending down a channel to a gift behind the pulpit so it would speak to you and you would catch and say oh my he's speaking directly to me I've had people come up and say who told you who told you what you know I said nobody told me I remember one time very specifically my translator brother ladislav zalis over in in Poland he's a cish brother but he was my Polish translator and we got together and I gave him my scriptures and and we preached our sermon when we were done he had the elders take him outside and I saw them all speaking to now I don't speak Polish but I read uh body language and I can tell and he's going and and so anyway later I said what was that all about he said brother Ron what you had preached on was so specific they were such issues within our church they all assumed I told you so you'd preach on it see well listen that's just the word of Goden and so it is there are times even in a service where there might be 500 people in the church but God is Discerning and taking one person and and very specifically giving them a word amen and yet I believe God in his infinite grace and mercy that when the word of God is going forth he's going to give something if you're sensitized and if you're ready and if you're listening everyone no matter if you're a babe in Christ or if you're a mature adult God is going to give you something through the ministry why the word of God will never return unto him void it will always accomplish ACC that which it's intended to do so the Holy Spirit began to discern among many Believers and how they're anointed in their flesh or their Spirit realm but not down in the soul or the heart in fact just before service Sandy was had turned on a tape while I was in my office and she's getting her hair ready and she's listening to the sermon three kinds of Believers and he says in every assembly but not in mine everybody else's I feel sorry brother meno you know you but in mine I only no as much as we would want to brag and like to think everybody's predestinated elect of God ordained of God bride of Christ they're not there's three kinds of Believers in every assembly and your life right now is bearing witness of which you are are you a True Believer are you living by the word or are you a make believer are you a crow putting in Dove feathers and saying look at me I'm a I'm a dove are you an unbeliever I never did believe that now sometimes you have those sitting in the church and they'll sit right among you for years until something triggers and then all of a sudden you wonder where did they go what happened it happens in every Church brother Bram said right there in his own assembly now let's take now my subject that I was talking about the the heart of the matter because there are many Believers even among Message Church is today that that is the problem the heart of the matter is their heart has never been fully given over to God they've got an intellectual conception they follow along they've been born into it right they just kind of follow along well this is what we do my family are believers so therefore it makes me a Believer no it doesn't every man works out his own salvation with fear and trembling one thing about Sandy and I when we came to this message you know we hadn't we weren't raised up around it our our mother and father were not message Believers so that when God opened our eyes it was it was something so precious amen that we we forsook all Sand's own father was so upset with her that he wanted her out of the house she left her house she's got eight brothers three sisters and bless bless her heart she left her house with two cardboard sacks you know you get from the gr grocery store full of her clothes and she left because he said you know he he just told her some pretty rough things because she didn't believe quote the Catholic Church she was raised in the Catholic church she said prayers she was a good girl she never gave her daddy one kind of problem the only time that she ever really got a real licking in her life she she crawled out the window cuz a couple of her girlfriends asked her to go to a young life uh meeting that night and uh her Daddy had said no you're not going to go well she snuck out the window and went and uh later I think the father came by her bedroom somehow he found out that she's not there and he waited up till so she got home crawled through the window again uh-huh well I'll tell you she she knew her daddy's anger then and I tell you he I'm I'm going to use these words he beat her cuz she couldn't walk and uh she never forgot and all she was doing is going to a Christian you know young life it wasn't it wasn't Catholic it wasn't sanctioned by the Catholic Church church and it wasn't she's going out and drinking and smoking no she she she has told me she says honey she says I've as a little girl I would always say my prayers and once I got done saying my prayers then I would talk to God she said I've always had a relationship with God and you know it's not reciting a prayer it's not heal Maries or uh all of the different things that you do and say and you memorize this prayer and you say it 50 times and you do Penance for no but you know I had a young boy this 12-year-old boy in Germany who had just given his heart to the Lord he says well what do I do when I pray I said just talk to God he says well how do I do that I said how do you talk to a friend he says well we just take an interest and we start talking about it I said well that's the way it is with God I said uh just start talking to him so the heart of the matter for many Believers is a subject of what's in your heart how is your heart doing you know the word of God is the answer to all of our problems to all of our troubles boil it all down hey the fact of the matter is the heart of the matter is something's wrong right here I can see in your heart that's why brother Brenham under discernment okay they would come up in the prayer line and he he doesn't see anything physically wrong but he says no I feel there's something on your heart see now he's Discerning so I am so amazed at how many times the prophet of God during a time of a prayer line that he actually discerns their heart there's nothing physically now it may show up in physical Realms like an example I've used it before that woman who comes up and he says oh I see you're a Christian I feel that that comforting spirit I feel that welcoming Spirit but there's something wrong it's something oh I see I see a Blackness I oh I see what it is it's a lie someone St a lie on you and that man claims to be divine healer and he said you're a witch and and says you're not a witch and he says in this hard trouble that you got bothering you he said that's because of the lie and he says why you and he doesn't you know sit for her no you know what he says you just go on your way there's nothing wrong with you you're not a witch go and serve God and she walks away she was delivered what was God doing Discerning the word of God coming to the prophet Discerning between the spirit and the soul so if you have Christ in your heart and as I showed you the quote the other day brother brandham said that the heart of God is Jesus Christ and when the Heart of Jesus Christ comes into your heart it changes your heart create in me a clean heart soften my heart with oil we sing all of these songs about the heart and brother Brenham says in the infallible proof of the Resurrection the sin question is settled when the Holy Spirit comes into the human heart it casts down reasoning it goes above our intellectual Affair now today the reason so many ups and downs and things are enter into the religious people because there's an intellectual conception of Christ in other words in their mind mind and not in their heart do you see that this is where I as a minister in every Minister I think his desire is God let what we preach not just tickle the ears and and do something to the mind but go beyond the Mind into the heart and we as pastors and preachers sometimes you can preach uh against all these things but some sometimes what you do is you just kind of instead of going after those things appeal to their heart like if your children are having a real hard time what do you do I'm gonna ground you I tell you you're not gonna I tell I'm taking this away and and all you got the kids are just waiting for Dad to just shut up it it ain't helping nothing I'm going to ground you you're not going to this and that okay okay but how about sitting on the edge of the bed saying son I see you're struggling I I just come in here to pray for you I was once a young man the apple don't fall far from the tree I know what it was like as a young kid and this and that and all of a sudden you talk and the all of a sudden you appeal to their heart that's right that's good and you're not yelling at him you're just saying hey you know I can't force you I can ground you I can do all this stuff but it's not because of the law it's because of Love why are we serving God is it out of a lawful thing that I've got to do this and God in heaven is is waiting in heaven for me to step out of line and then wh you're dust man you're you're going to pay for that buddy oh I thank God that he's not like that he's a he's a mindful God he's a just God he's a forgiving God let me finish this quote here see they just mentally believe it and your mental will reason could it be so could Divine Healing be so could the baptism of the spirit be so now that's intellectual reasoning see when that comes into the heart it's Faith it's positive there's no question at all about it settled forever it's in your heart and your heart doesn't reason because it's the throne The Dwelling Place of the almighty is in the heart let me say that again The Dwelling Place what house are you going to build in y the dwelling place is the human heart the heart is the control room for God the unity of one God in the one Church you see the little part compartment in a man's heart God made that in there for himself that's his control room he sets there to control you that's his place that's where he sends his messages from the control room did they have that quote up there are you following along with me did you okay let's finish this quot quote if you have it if you don't go home go home and read it because it's in the unity of one God and one church but when he comes in to be a new creature and the old man has passed out and the new man Christ takes his throne in the human heart then life looks different then he starts on a new road from his new from his own selfish motives till the big idea is to make himself something big he starts right towards Calvary to recognize God then his all his objective his motive his achievement all that he is lays in the glory of the Cross where Christ paid the price for human life Christ is our life somebody say Amen to that it's not the operating of the gifts of the Spirit or the speaking in tongues that is the evidence of the holy spirit in your soul now let me show you a couple this is a pergan church age I hope we have these quotes here pergami and church age here is p 164 and for the sake of time tonight and I'm not a a real good reader I want you to to note very carefully that Jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying or shouting and dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth amen the evidence would be that you're in the truth now I want to ask you what is truth Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life and no man comes to the father but by me it says that the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of God for your age age evidence has to do with receiving that word evidence has to do with receiving the word that's what Sarah did where she had been receiving Seed of Abraham for years and God was speaking to Abraham you're going to have a son and it's going to be through Sarah but Sarah herself had to come the promise was given to Abraham but was to be made manifest in Sarah and it couldn't manifest until she said be it unto me according to Thy word the Bible says and Sarah by faith receive strength to conceive seed not receive seed to conceive she'd been receiving Abraham's seed since she was a young woman but now one day Faith set upon her heart and that word conceived and took life paragraph 169 the evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same it was back in the day of our lord it's receiving the word of Truth for the day in which you live we call it the message of the hour recognizing your day and its message Jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word Works would follow that's the Bible paragraph 272 now I'm sure that you have noticed that those whose names were in The Book of Life were a part of the religious order of that day religious order of that day that centered around the true God and worship of him do you catch this yeah so these are churchgoing people they're good people people do not go to church to do bad so it's centered around religious order and around the true God and worship of him though they did not worship according to the truth according to the truth brother Bram said the word like Judas they didn't go all the way see how Judas was chosen of God he was instructed in truth he shared the knowledge of the Mysteries he had a Ministry of power granted unto him and he healed the sick and cast out devils in jesus' name but when The Showdown came he sold out for gold and political power he did not go up to Pentecost to receive the spirit of God he was devor void of the spirit make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way I didn't capitalize or put I tell you know word all the way that's him that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas failed multitudes fall right there and when they fail to go on in that word their names are taken off the Book of Life notice taking off The Book of Life Book of Life not Lamb's Book of Life that's right there's a vast difference he said your once your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life he said when was it put on there before the foundation of the world see those who have their names on the Lamb's Book of Life Will Follow the word all the way they can't help it there's something drawing them something pulling them they cannot deny their very birth God cannot deny when you give back to God the Revelation he gives to you he cannot deny it when you give it back to him the Holiness in dress the long hair the without makeup all of those things when you give that back to God God said that's righteousness why because it's his word don't you know that it's an Abomination for a woman to put on clothes that pertains to a man it's an Abomination I want to ask you how many preachers outside of this message are preaching something like that huh Noah women are in their pants suits women preachers shorts right cut hair right and I'm not trying to judge them I I I'm just saying what he said okay now watch the word of God is is a sharp two-edged sword Discerning now between spirit and soul what brother Ron you saying they're bad I didn't say they're bad people is that the Holy Spirit anointing them absolutely do you think they're worshiping God absolutely but in vain do they worship him why they're not in truth they're not in truth now let me see here it's a known fact that those that have left the what we call the message they could have never had the Holy Spirit the oh on their on their Spirit yes could they have bethl anointings bethl experiences absolutely many people have bethl experiences Jacob had bethl experiences saw angels descending and descending he said this is an awful place why wow he saw all kinds of Supernatural things never changed his life until he come to a place called pineal where he says I met God face to face and I wrestled with him the problem with people today is they don't wrestle with God enough they don't wrestle until is this is this message really true if there's anyone here that you have this question within your mind get alone go off have some time pray and fast and ask God is this true will you show me something will you give me a sign hey you know what he's he'll do something but if you're so stubborn and hard-headed and like a horse that's grabbed the bit and pull it in his mouth if you ever had a horse run away with you and they grab the bit in their teeth there and then you're trying whoa whoa whoa and you're trying to they're just running off at you I had a little old Apple loose this old thing had to toughest mouth I put a twisted snaffle in there and I loosened up the bridal and I I saw the mouth until red Foams coming out there in other words I'm sensitizing his mouth sounds a little rough doesn't it but some of you need a snaffle a twisted snaffle and you need God to kind of saw your mouth a little bit cuz you got a hard mouth and you you just run away at anything and this this this old guy he was only three years old and he Appaloosa and there he was he was running away with me and I'm whoa whoa whoa and I he couldn't pull up so I reached down and with my left hand I grabbed right near the the bridal and the bit I pulled his face around and and and we're running at a full gallon and I got him looking at me and I went Bo I hit him as hard as I could let the head go and he almost fell with me then he slowed down I said yeah when I say wo I mean wo sometimes we get so hardheaded hard-hearted and when you do God may have to do drastic measures listen to me did it with Billy Paul Billy was hard daddy I'm going to run off and get married what brother brand he's out washing the car oh Billy go butt your head against the wall That's foolish you're just a young but yeah well Daddy I'm serious I'm Oh Billy he goes out and gets married right and they have to anull it because she was underage and Billy Paul was was underage and they went and annulled the marriage then they asked brother Brenham questions and answers brother Brenham is annulment the same as divorce yeah yeah he says this he says this kills me to have to tell you guys this he said but my own son went out here and he run off and the other father and I we had to go on an old the marriage and he said I couldn't even go to his wedding he he said I couldn't bless his wedding and then but he never stopped Billy from coming to church because he had done wrong okay andone he he married Lois okay which would have been his second marriage so anybody that's critical on somebody that's been double married or had an issue in their past then you would have been very critical of brother Billy Paul ever come up and prayed over the meeting or prayed for people people sometimes do crazy things okay because they're not thinking right the words not down their heart and Lois and Billy had full four full-time babies have you been to the gravide and you seen the small little stones with the little lambs on top four of them brother Brenham finally went before God and he said hasn't Billy and Lois suffered enough he said all of a sudden I broke into a vision I saw Billy holding a little blue a baby in a blue Bank blanket brother Ram said it kills me to have to say these things he says my my my own son he says he would have even had a great ministry but he said but you know what he messed it up because he goes out here and he marries the wrong one so on marriage and divorce let me tell you brother Brenham never changes his his viewpoint on that he said now before I had thus sayith the Lord on it we had we had a Northwest and a Northeast but it wasn't a true north and he said this highest side hit the ditch all Grace this side all long both of them hitting the ditch oh God help us huh amen now I had made a statement with those that have left the message and I'm not talking about uh anyone in particular I'm talk let's just Universal around the world I just came from Germany where uh a young pastor and and his wife 25 years pastoring the church here gets up and tells in front of his CH in front of his church without any um warning or anything he said I want to ask all of you to forgive me I've been following a false prophet for 25 years brother bram's a false prophet can you imagine and so I was facing some of these issues when I went over there in Germany because now that couple is going around not satisfied to just leave the church they now are going to anyone that will listen to them of why brother Bramson false false prophet I had to one brother one time he called me up brother Ron just give me five minutes I said you want to have coffee with me that's fine I don't care we'll have coffee you want to just visit I said sure I'll meet with you he said well will you give me five minutes for me to tell you what's wrong with the message and where brother BR went wrong I said I ain't got time I says the die is cast I'm beyond the point of no return n no hey let me tell you you cannot if somebody can talk you out of this message you never were in it am I'm sorry and so I had to address some of these things with the pastor and his associate just personally because issues are coming up and they say well there's such a the the like this young couple said now we're free we're free in Christ we can do anything we want cut my hair wear makeup wear pants and yeah I'm free we were we were was a cult they just they just push this religion and so now we're free and we can go to other churches and we can worship and he is love and God and we can worship and it's a false Liberty because you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free if you've got Christ in your heart it'll not be some legalistic side if I kept the law no it's going to be because you're in love with him why do you dress the way you do cuz I love him amen oh I think you're doing it because it's a self-righteous some are I'll admit that there are some maybe here right tonight they're wearing a dress and they're just as hypocritical as they could be yep there are hypocrites yep yep yep do I deny that no I don't but what about the true what about the True Believers what about the ones that have stayed true what about the ones who are still in love with God it don't matter and if it was their Pastor or their father or somebody else and they left they never left they stayed true with the word of God Amen that's the kind of church that God has coming after you're going to be tempted and tried things are going to come your way infallible proof of the Resurrection 57 the sin question is settled when the Holy Spirit comes into the human heart I read that one didn't I okay let's go on let me read to you in Romans chap 2 verse 14 and 15 and when the Gentiles which have not the law do by Nature the things contained in the law these having not the law have a law unto themselves which show the work of the law written where in their hearts Gentiles who have not the law who weren't in the message who never heard the message who never knew the Native Indians whoever make whatever the Gentiles who have a law W written within their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thought and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another let me tell you what uh they've designed a a little meter system put a little light detector put some things on your finger something on top of your head and said where were you on the night of such and such uh were you at home yes or the needle goes they they can see cuz the guy he's got a law on his heart should I shouldn't lie but not see they've got a law written within themselves either accusing themselves or excusing they have a law within their hearts if our hearts condemn us how can we approach God a troubled heart is causes a troubled mind and a condemning heart it does when there is transgression of the word of God condemnation is ever present transgression and condemnation are always found together they're buddies do something wrong watch condemnation and transgression are always together do something wrong I feel you know and then get around here's something about message Believers go to message church and you have to understand you're godly people you're trying to do the very best that you can is that right you're trying you know you're not here trying to judge everybody else but if somebody who is transgressing the word of God comes among message believers they feel they're being judged I don't feel comfortable why are they not comfortable huh why well I I just don't feel welcome no the holy spirit is doing coming and causing you to have conviction conviction is Godly conviction is when God tells you don't do that before you do it conviction and then you transgress and step over the conviction then you come to condemnation then he can then the devil condemns you you see conviction is when God is saying oh you you no don't do that don't go there don't say that don't look at this don't do that you transgress now you have condemnation they feel condemned that's why certain ones sin comes in hardens the heart they feel unwelcomed among message Believers and they start claiming that all of the message Believers are hypocrites and self-righteous and everything and oh yeah what can you say because that's what they feel and uh you see at some time in your Christian experience you're going to fall and make a mistake all of you yeah you will musicians go ahead and come I'm closing you're either going to make a mistake willfully or unwillfully but you make a mistake you'll step over that line You'll yeah you know and you'll sin in one form or another and when you fail transgress or do iniquity step over the conviction of God then you've set yourself up as a target for the devil I thought you called yourself a Christian huh then you get to all this condemnation and you come to church and you feel I feel condemned when you feel that way repent say God I'm sorry I shouldn't have done it and he with open arms will forgive you when it comes from the heart not up here huh my brother and I we fought so much as kids that my parents bought us boxing gloves they moved out the furniture in the front of the house there and okay have at it here put the gloves on now knock him out go ahead then we started crying we didn't want to hit but we did five minutes ago come here man you put the Box in go ahead knock him out we no I don't want to hit him he's my brother oh I wish you had that true love yeah for him as a brother you'd never the last time I had a physical fight with my brother and yeah we got into it man and we were in a Volkswagen Bug they got the little emergency break right in the center between the seats going down the road I said something man my brother got the he this and that I pulled that emergency brake this car went and we jumped out right there car is going by we're having at at Mitch Buckingham from flagst he got out there now stop stop you guys are going to kill one another my brother goes and he hit Mitch in a CH okay kill yourselves I don't care so I've always been a little bit tougher than my brother and he'll admit it I got him in a headlock maybe he won't but I got him in a headlock and when I had a headlock I said stop stop I don't want to hurt you stop and he's given me kidney punches the whole time he's said just as hard as I said stop now I start crying cuz I'm so upset I said please stop I don't want to fight and I threw him away from me he's coming after me I told him I said brother I'm going to tell you right now I will never fight you the rest of my life it's over it's done I don't believe Brothers should be fighting like we were and I've never fought with him physically oh we've had words but it's never been a physical there's where when you know you got sibling rivalry it it's it comes up whether it's girls or [Music] boys if you had the love of God in your heart you wouldn't be doing that you find out that when you transgress you set yourself up for a target of the devil it's time to stop running away from God and run to God huh Proverbs 3: 5-6 trust in the Lord with all thine heart lean not to your own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths amen two more verses in Scripture that I want to show you because five places in the Bible it talks about serve the Lord with all thine heart and with all thy Soul connecting the soul and the Heart together Deuteronomy 6: 1-9 now these are the Commandments the statutes and the judgments and the message of the hour which your God commanded to teach you that you might do them the in the land whether you go to possess it that thou mightest fear the lord thy God to keep all his statutes and his Commandments which I commanded thee thou and thy son and thy son's son and all the days of thy life that thy days may be prolonged hear therefore o Israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee that ye may increase mightily as the Lord God of thy fathers has promised Thee the land that floweth with milk and honey here oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I commanded thee to this day shall be in thine heart Thou shalt teach them diligently to thy children thou shallal talk of them when thou sest in thy house when thou west by the way when thou liest down when thou risest up Thou shalt bind him for a sign on the hand and thou shalt put frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them on the gates of thy house and on thy Gates watch this because I want you to notice carefully I bring this last quote from Deuteronomy chapter 30 and it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon thee the blessing and the curse you decide which you want the blessing of the curse because God said don't mug me because be not deceived God is Not mocked whatsoever you sow it's a law of God that shall you [Music] reap so look at this the blessing in the curse which I have set before thee Thou shalt call them to my among all the nations in other words think about these things when you're out here among all the nations whether the Lord thy God hath driven thee and thou shalt return un the Lord thy God and thou shalt obey his voice according to all that I commanded thee this day thou and thy children and with all thine heart and with all thy soul that when the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and we return and gather thee from all the nations whether the Lord thy God hath scattered thee and if any of thine be driven out under the utmost parts of Heaven from then will the Lord thy God gather thee no matter how far they go David said oh God if I make my bed in hell he says Thou Art with me h thy God gather thee and from then will he fetch thee and the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possess and thou shalt possess it he will do thee good and multiply thee upon above thy fathers and the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart and the Heart of thy seed to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest live and the Lord thy God will put these curses upon the thine enemies and on them that hate thee which persecuted thee and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the Lord and do all his Commandments which I commanded thee this day and the Lord thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thy hand and the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy the cattle the fruit of the land for good for the Lord will again Rejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over thy fathers for Thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to keep his Commandments his statutes which are written in this book of the law if thou W turn to the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy Soul the heart of the matter is the condition of the heart look at he says look I choose choose choose either the cursing or the blessing choose because I'm giving you all of these statutes and Commandments I want to bless Thee I want to bless you I want to bless your seed but if you go away against my statue you go away from those things that I've given unto you that you might possess the land I'll be a curse to you your enemies shall overcome you but he says if you'll do that which I tell you to do guess what I'll do I'll be an enemy to your enemies huh God bless you speaking about the heart is a deceitful thing it's so wicked who can know its ways God let my heart be cleansed let me hide Thy word in my heart not my head greatest battle ever fought it's right here but when you say God not my will but thine be done then it settle in your [Music] heart and you don't live a Holiness way of life because that's going to gain you access to Heaven no you do it because you're in love because you've fallen in love with him and if you love me he said you keep my Commandments he didn't say if you love me you acknowledge my Commandments you sing about my Commandments you sing about my love no if you love me you keep them God bless you all
