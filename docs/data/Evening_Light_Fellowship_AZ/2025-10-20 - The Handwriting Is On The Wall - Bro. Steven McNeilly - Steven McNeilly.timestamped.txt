[13:55] father, appreciate you so much, Lord
[13:58] God.
[14:00] Father, as we look at ourselves, Lord,
[14:02] there's no hope. But Lord, as we look at
[14:05] ourselves through your eyes, Lord God,
[14:07] there's a totally different life, Lord
[14:09] God, help us all to see ourselves, Lord
[14:13] God,
[14:15] the way you see us, Father.
[14:19] Oh Lord, what a difference, Lord. May
[14:21] you give us that revelation, Lord God,
[14:23] to see ourselves, Lord, as you see us,
[14:26] Lord. To see one another
[14:28] as you see us, Father.
[14:31] Lord, there's many prayer requests this
[14:33] morning. Lord God, we know that you're
[14:36] mindful of them all. Lord God, you knew
[14:40] what they would be before the foundation
[14:42] of the world. Lord God, you knew that
[14:45] each one of us would be here this
[14:46] morning before the foundation of the
[14:48] world. So Lord, we just know that all
[14:52] things are in your hands, Lord. Amen.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; But you said for us to ask
[14:57] &gt;&gt; that it be given to us.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; And you told us to ask abundantly
[15:03] &gt;&gt; that our joy might be full, Lord God. So
[15:06] we lift these up, Lord God, before our
[15:08] sisters and brothers, Lord God.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; Father, you have your ways, Lord God.
[15:14] You designed it to be the way that it
[15:18] is, Lord God. for us to be that
[15:20] mouthpiece, Lord God, when you would
[15:23] have us to be, Lord, even as you would
[15:25] move upon us or call upon us, Lord God.
[15:29] It's fallen my lot this morning, Lord,
[15:32] to speak for these,
[15:35] to lift these up before you in prayer,
[15:37] to bring them before you, Lord. So do
[15:40] we, Lord, humbly, Lord God.
[15:43] Lord, knowing that we can do nothing
[15:45] within ourselves, Lord God. And that's
[15:48] why we look unto you, Lord God, for all
[15:50] our needs. Father,
[15:53] may you touch each one of these, Lord,
[15:55] in a gentle and kind way that only you
[15:58] can, Lord God.
[16:01] May you heal our healing needed, Lord
[16:03] God, both spiritually and naturally.
[16:06] Father,
[16:07] thank you for being with Brother Ron and
[16:10] Sister Sandy, Brother Mario, his wife.
[16:14] Lord,
[16:15] I'm sure, Lord God, you use them to
[16:17] touch lives. Father,
[16:19] &gt;&gt; may you bring them home safely, Father.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; May you bless us in this service this
[16:26] morning, Lord. May you anoint
[16:29] the speaker, Lord God. And may you
[16:31] anoint our ears to hear and our hearts
[16:34] to receive, Lord God. Let us not come in
[16:37] vain, Lord, but leave here better
[16:39] Christians than when we came. for thy
[16:42] glory and honor. We pray these things.
[16:44] Father, we commit this service into your

[16:48] yourself in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.

[28:29] Justin sang this song several months ago
[28:32] and it's on our list of songs that to
[28:34] sing as a congregation and
[28:38] asked him to sing it this morning as he
[28:40] sings it once. We'll join in and sing it
[28:42] together. It's a beautiful song
[28:45] and I know you'll be blessed by it this
[28:46] morning. We'll have Justin sing it once
[28:48] and then we'll all join in with him and
[28:50] sing it with him.
[28:52] enter in to what this song can do for
[28:54] you and what it has done and it will do.

[39:18] [Music]
[39:20] You will always be

[39:27] Holy forever.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[39:32] praise this morning.
[39:38] Hallelujah. Let's all bow our hearts.
[39:40] Father God,
[39:42] &gt;&gt; you art holy, Lord.
[39:44] Father, our holiness, our righteousness
[39:48] is as filthy rags, but Lord, we're not
[39:51] depending upon our own righteousness
[39:53] this morning, but we're depending upon
[39:56] thy righteousness and thy holiness. And
[39:58] so, Father, we just ask this morning
[40:01] that you would come by and speak to our
[40:04] hearts, Lord. Teach us from your word,
[40:07] Father. May we recognize the day and the
[40:10] hour in which we're living in. And may
[40:13] we see Lord that there's the
[40:15] handwriting, Father, is on the wall this
[40:18] morning. And may we have a spiritual
[40:21] understanding, Lord, to be able to read
[40:24] the handwriting and to understand it,
[40:27] Father, that we might know how to
[40:29] prepare our lives. Lord, we love you. We
[40:31] thank you. We commit all things into thy
[40:33] hands for thy kingdom's glory. Let
[40:35] everything be said and done in Jesus
[40:38] Christ's name. Amen.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you this
[40:42] morning. We welcome you to the house of
[40:45] the Lord and it's always an honor and a
[40:48] privilege to be here and uh to speak the
[40:51] word of God. If you have your Bibles,
[40:53] turn with me to the book of Daniel.
[40:55] Thank you musicians so much. Then we'll
[40:57] read uh chapter 5 and we'll start at
[41:01] verse five. We'll kind of skip down
[41:04] through this chapter here. And uh
[41:07] certainly enjoyed the word on Wednesday
[41:09] night from brother James and uh you know
[41:12] it's pretty pretty interesting whenever
[41:15] God has a channel
[41:16] &gt;&gt; and um you know brother Johnny Green he
[41:19] he he looked back to me after service
[41:21] and he said my that was part two of
[41:24] Sunday
[41:25] &gt;&gt; and um some have asked and and they
[41:28] asked well you know did did brother
[41:30] Stephen and brother James share notes
[41:32] together and um and here's the gospel
[41:35] truth. truth. We didn't, but we did
[41:38] because we have the same anointing and
[41:40] the same inspiration. And so last Monday
[41:43] before he preached, um, he told me,
[41:46] "Yeah, I was 5 minutes into your sermon
[41:49] and I turned it off because you were
[41:51] walking all over my notes."
[41:54] And, um, so we have to recognize when
[41:58] something like that happened that it's
[42:00] not just happen stance.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; That it's God. The Holy Spirit is trying
[42:05] to get something across to the people
[42:07] cuz God will take two men not talking to
[42:10] each other. Uh we're actually in we were
[42:12] in different parts of the country from
[42:14] one another but come a service after the
[42:17] other with the same thought with the
[42:20] same avenue. What is that? That's not a
[42:22] man.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Spirit.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. So now we have to be
[42:28] spiritually minded and ask ourselves
[42:32] what is God trying to get across to us
[42:34] through these last two services.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; So I'll let you answer that question
[42:39] yourselves. Amen. Daniel 5 verse 5 and
[42:44] it says
[42:48] uh
[42:51] Belshazar the king. No this is verse
[42:54] one. Um, Belshazar the king made a great
[42:58] feast to a thousand of his lords and
[43:01] drank wine before the thousand.
[43:04] Belshazar, while he tasted the wine,
[43:06] commanded to bring the golden and silver
[43:09] vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar
[43:12] had taken out of the temple which was in
[43:14] Jerusalem, that the king and his
[43:16] princes, his wives, and his concubines
[43:19] might drink therein. Then they brought
[43:22] the golden vessels that were taken out
[43:24] of the temple of the house of God which
[43:25] was at Jerusalem. And the king and his
[43:28] princes and his wives and his concubines
[43:30] drank in them. They drank wine and they
[43:32] praised the gods of gold, the god and of
[43:35] silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and
[43:39] of stone. So here they were taking
[43:42] vessels that were taken from the house
[43:44] of God that were sanctified and and set
[43:48] aside for God's service. And yet they
[43:50] were using these very vessels and making
[43:53] mockery out of them. They were they were
[43:56] drinking from these vessels and they
[43:57] were praising the god of gold, the god
[43:59] of silver, of iron, so on and so forth.
[44:04] And verse 5 says, "In the same hour came
[44:07] forth the finger of a man's hand and
[44:10] wrote over against the candlestick upon
[44:12] the plaster of the wall of the king's
[44:14] palace. And the king saw the part of the
[44:16] hand that wrote." Then the king's
[44:18] countenance was changed and his thoughts
[44:20] troubled him so that the joints of his
[44:23] loins were loosed and his knees smoked
[44:25] one against the other. Let's turn down
[44:29] to verse 22. We'll read 22 through 31.
[44:36] And it says, "And thou," this is Daniel
[44:39] speaking to the king, "and thou, his
[44:41] son, O Belshazar, has not humbled thine
[44:44] heart, though thou kneest all this, but
[44:47] hast lifted up thyself against the Lord
[44:49] of heaven, and they have brought the
[44:51] vessels of his house before thee, and
[44:53] thou and thy lords, thy wives, thy
[44:55] concubines have drunk wine in them, and
[44:58] thou has praised the gods of silver, of
[45:00] gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone,
[45:02] which see not, nor hear not, nor know
[45:06] and the God in whose hand thy breath is
[45:10] and whose are all thy ways hast thou not
[45:14] glorified. Then was the part of the hand
[45:17] sent from him and this right writing was
[45:20] written and this is the writing that was
[45:23] written man teel
[45:26] uh of farson. This is the interpretation
[45:30] of the thing. Man, God hath numbered thy
[45:33] kingdom and finished it. Tea, thou art
[45:36] weighed in the balances, and art found
[45:38] wanting. Perez, thy kingdom is divided
[45:42] and given to the Mes and Persians. Then
[45:45] commanded Belshazar, and they clothed
[45:47] Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of
[45:49] gold about his neck, and made a
[45:51] proclamation concerning him that he
[45:53] should be the third ruler in the
[45:55] kingdom. In that night was Belshazar,
[45:58] the king of the Chaldans slain, and
[46:01] Darius the Median, took the kingdom,
[46:03] being about three score and two years
[46:06] old. Amen. You may take your seat this
[46:08] morning.
[46:10] We'll trust that the Lord will add the
[46:12] blessing to the reading of his word. I
[46:15] would like to title my sermon this
[46:17] morning, The Handwriting is on the wall.
[46:23] The book of Daniel, it begins with
[46:25] Jehoak Jehookim who was the king of
[46:28] Judah uh in Jerusalem. And at this time
[46:32] of his kingship, we understand that uh
[46:36] Jerusalem was besieged and it was taken
[46:39] by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. And
[46:43] you know the Bible it the Bible is a
[46:47] book of prophecy. And we know that
[46:50] before this ever took place to in
[46:53] Jerusalem and to the king of Judah,
[46:55] Jehakim, it was already prophesied by
[46:58] the by the prophet Jeremiah of what was
[47:02] going to take place. For Jeremiah 25:es
[47:05] 8-12 says, "Therefore, thus saith the
[47:09] Lord of hosts." And we understand that
[47:11] whenever a prophet comes along and he
[47:14] says, "Thus sayaeth the Lord," we know
[47:16] that this is God speaking. And it has to
[47:19] come to pass. There is no denying it. Uh
[47:23] perhaps we would we would look at the
[47:25] the the the prophecy and we would say,
[47:28] "My uh this prophecy isn't coming to
[47:31] pass according to how we felt it should
[47:34] or according to the timing that we think
[47:36] it should." But nonetheless, when God
[47:38] speaks, it has to come to pass.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Because ye have not obeyed my words.
[47:45] Verse verse 9. Now behold, I will send
[47:48] and take all the families of the north,
[47:50] sayeth the Lord, and Nebuchadnezzar, the
[47:52] king of Babylon, my servant, and will
[47:55] bring them against this land, and
[47:57] against the inhabitants thereof, and
[47:59] against all these nations round about,
[48:01] and will utterly destroy them, and make
[48:03] them an astonishment, and an hissing, a
[48:06] perpetual desolations. Moreover, I will
[48:09] take from them the voice of mirth and
[48:11] the voice of gladness, the voice of the
[48:13] bridegroom, and the voice of the bride,
[48:16] the sound of the millstones, and the
[48:17] light of the candle. And this whole land
[48:20] shall be a desolation and an
[48:22] astonishment, and these nations shall
[48:24] serve the king of Babylon 70 years.
[48:27] Notice how how onpoint prophecy is. Not
[48:32] only does he does he use the name of the
[48:34] king that's going to come and take over,
[48:36] but he also gives a timeline of how long
[48:40] they're going to be in captivity for.
[48:43] And it shall come to pass when 70 years
[48:45] are accomplished that I will punish the
[48:47] king of Babylon and that nation, sayeth
[48:49] the Lord, for their iniquity in the land
[48:52] of the Chaldanss and and will make it
[48:54] perpetual
[48:56] desolations.
[48:58] So understand that when God speaks
[49:00] through his prophets, it'll never fail.
[49:04] When God gives thus sayaeth the Lord,
[49:06] such and such is going to happen. And
[49:08] and this is going to happen. When a
[49:11] prophet speaks it under the inspiration
[49:13] of God, we know that it is God himself
[49:17] who was speaking through a mouthpiece
[49:19] because the Bible says that uh that God
[49:22] shall do nothing
[49:23] &gt;&gt; unless he first reveals his secrets onto
[49:27] his prophets. And so we are very
[49:30] wellversed and taught with prophets and
[49:33] we know what to look for. And that's why
[49:35] we can look at this this this prophet
[49:38] messenger that we follow by the name of
[49:40] William Brham and we can say this man is
[49:43] as surely is a prophet of God because
[49:47] each time that he said thus sayeth the
[49:49] Lord it came to pass. Therefore the
[49:51] Bible says if a man speaks in my name
[49:54] and it comes to pass hear that man
[49:57] &gt;&gt; because that man is my mouthpiece that
[49:59] man is my voice and that man has a
[50:02] message for you.
[50:05] So we understand that every time that
[50:08] brother Brandham was was under the
[50:10] inspiration of God and people would come
[50:13] before him and and and he would speak to
[50:15] them and he would and he would tell them
[50:18] tell them their life. He would tell them
[50:20] what is what's been wrong in their life
[50:22] that was causing a sickness or whatever
[50:25] it might have been. Every time he spoke
[50:27] and he said thus sayeth the Lord, it was
[50:29] never wrong.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. And so, Brother Brandham
[50:33] would people would begin to say when he
[50:35] was getting to the end of his ministry,
[50:38] they would say, "Well, yeah, he he has a
[50:41] a prophetic gift. He has a gift to to to
[50:45] speak and to discern the hearts of the
[50:47] people, but in his doctrine, he's off."
[50:51] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham would say, "How
[50:53] does this make any sense at all? It is
[50:56] either all of God or none of it is of
[50:59] God. If it's not wrong with thus sayeth
[51:02] the Lord and the discernments and the
[51:04] prophesyings, his doctrine is not wrong
[51:06] either because it comes from the same
[51:09] spirit. It comes from the same God.
[51:11] Whether it's prophecy of speaking or
[51:14] whether it's prophesying by the word of
[51:16] the Lord, it's all from the same God.
[51:19] Therefore, one isn't right and one isn't
[51:22] wrong. It is all right.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:25] That's why we can have trust in what he
[51:28] said because the vindication was never
[51:31] wrong.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Thousands of times it happened. People
[51:38] would come before him and he would speak
[51:40] to them in the name of the Lord and it
[51:42] was never ever wrong.
[51:45] Therefore, if that was never wrong,
[51:48] don't let anybody try to deceive you and
[51:51] say that his doctrine is wrong. Amen.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Because it is thus saith the Lord.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Some people say, "Well, California
[52:01] hasn't sank yet." It was thus sayaeth
[52:04] the Lord.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; This hasn't happened over here yet, but
[52:07] yet it was thus saith the Lord.
[52:10] Therefore, we just need to be patient in
[52:13] our waiting.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:19] So we see that Daniel and Hannah,
[52:22] Mishael, and Azeriah,
[52:24] if you don't know that, that's Shadrach,
[52:27] Meshach, and Abedneo. A lot of us, you
[52:29] know, we we we understand the the the
[52:32] the the
[52:34] uh the pagan names that were given to
[52:36] these brothers, but that wasn't their
[52:38] original names. Their original name was
[52:41] Hannah. Hannah, and Michel, and Azeriah,
[52:44] and of course, Daniel. We understand
[52:47] that they were taken captive by
[52:50] Nebuchadnezzar at this time of of of the
[52:54] besieging of Jerusalem. And they were
[52:57] taken and they were taken to Babylon
[52:59] where they would serve Nebuchadnezzar.
[53:02] And these young men, though they were
[53:05] taken by Nebuchadnezzar,
[53:07] though they were taken from their
[53:09] homeland, and and yet they were young
[53:12] men, yet they had a a true revelation of
[53:15] who Jehovah was. They had a true
[53:18] revelation of what God was, of what his
[53:21] laws were, of what his ways were, and
[53:24] and a revelation of of how they were to
[53:27] to live their lives,
[53:29] and how they were to live their lives
[53:32] and serve God. It wasn't depending upon
[53:35] a geographical location. So, in other
[53:38] words, it didn't matter if they were in
[53:40] uh Jerusalem or if they were in Babylon
[53:43] or wherever they were uh where wherever
[53:46] they were in life of location, it didn't
[53:50] matter because they had a a true
[53:52] revelation of number one, who they were,
[53:55] &gt;&gt; number two, who God was and what his
[53:58] laws were. Right?
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Because it says in Daniel 1:8, "But
[54:03] Daniel proposed in his heart, purposed
[54:06] in his heart, that he would not defile
[54:08] himself with the portion of the king's
[54:10] meat, nor with the wine which he drank.
[54:13] Therefore, he requested of the prince of
[54:15] the Unix, that he might not defile
[54:18] himself." And when Daniel was speaking,
[54:21] we we we understand that Daniel was the
[54:24] leader of of his other three brothers
[54:26] that were taken captive because now he
[54:29] he approaches the unic and he says,
[54:31] "Hey, we have an obligation to God. I
[54:36] have a revelation that there's certain
[54:38] meat and certain things that I'm not to
[54:41] partake of or to put in my body. There
[54:43] are certain things as as a young Jew
[54:46] that I'm not supposed to defile my body
[54:49] with. And this portion of meat and this
[54:52] wine and and how you're expecting me to
[54:55] to to live my life is not according to
[54:58] the word of God.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; So it didn't matter who it was at work
[55:03] or who it was at school or if the
[55:05] teachers were trying to teach them the
[55:07] ways of Leodysia. Let me say trying to
[55:10] teach them the ways of Babylon. It
[55:13] didn't matter where they were or if mom
[55:15] or dad was with them or if they were
[55:17] standing alone. They had a true
[55:19] revelation. And when we have a true
[55:21] revelation of who we are, when we have a
[55:24] true revelation of the word of God in
[55:27] this day, a true revelation of how we're
[55:30] to live our lives, it doesn't matter
[55:32] where God takes us. It doesn't matter
[55:34] our geographical location. It doesn't
[55:37] matter if we're at church. It doesn't
[55:39] matter if we're at school, if we're at
[55:41] work, what part of the country we are
[55:43] in, we'll still live the same kind of
[55:45] life.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Steven, why is that?"
[55:49] Because it's a revelation.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Revelation doesn't come and go with the
[55:54] weather.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Revelation, you don't just live our
[55:56] lives by revelation when everything is
[55:59] going good and when the sun is out. No,
[56:01] we live our lives the same way every
[56:04] day.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't change with the group
[56:07] that we're around.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; It doesn't change with geographical
[56:12] location. It doesn't change when mom and
[56:14] dad or the pastor or preacher isn't
[56:17] around. No. But it's the same
[56:19] &gt;&gt; thing every day. The same life lived out
[56:24] no matter where we are or what is set
[56:27] before us.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:29] Amen. Right.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; The problem with message believers is
[56:35] that we're so good at disguising
[56:39] ourselves and becoming chameleons.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; When we're when we're with the people of
[56:44] the world, we we learn how to fit in.
[56:47] And when we come to church, we we
[56:50] understand how to fit in. We know what
[56:53] to say and when to say it. We know the
[56:55] right kind of clothing to wear uh that's
[56:58] pleasing that everybody else could look
[57:00] at us and say, "Well, that person is
[57:02] doing good."
[57:04] But yet, I wonder how it is when we're
[57:06] by ourselves. I wonder the reflection of
[57:10] our lives of of how we treat one another
[57:13] and everybody else, whatever it might
[57:14] be, or how we how we how we project our
[57:18] life, the life of Christ out. I wonder
[57:21] with some of us, does it change
[57:24] according to our environment?
[57:29] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Stephen, that's just
[57:31] for the young people." Nonsense.
[57:34] It is amazing what people, the uh older
[57:38] people will do, middle-aged people will
[57:40] do in order to be accepted at work,
[57:45] &gt;&gt; in order to get the pay raise, in order
[57:48] to get more money. Well, I got to
[57:50] provide for my family. Therefore, if I
[57:53] was to talk about God to to these
[57:56] people, I wouldn't get a pay raise. I
[57:59] would be an outcast. I would be this or
[58:01] I would be that. And therefore, we use
[58:04] it as an excuse to not express the love
[58:08] of God that's in our hearts. Amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; This is really I wasn't going to share
[58:15] this, but I'm going to
[58:19] So, we went I went with brother Amos for
[58:22] a a a business lunch meeting with these
[58:25] with these gentlemen and and they're
[58:29] pretty pretty wellto-d do pretty
[58:31] wellto-d do guys, let me say that. And
[58:34] so we're we're sitting at the table and
[58:37] uh and you know this is a business
[58:41] meeting. What do you talk about at a
[58:44] business meeting? Business. That's what
[58:47] it's all about. So we're sitting there
[58:49] and you know, brother Amos, he's just
[58:51] talking and all of a sudden he starts
[58:53] talking about the Lord and okay, well
[58:55] this is good and everything. So we sit
[58:57] down and we get get our food and stuff
[58:59] and I'm just kind of sitting there.
[59:01] there's a guy who's sitting next to me
[59:03] and and and brother Amos is with these
[59:05] other two brothers, the other two
[59:07] gentlemen over here and stuff. And so
[59:09] this guy's talking to me and um you know
[59:12] it was kind of hard to reel him in a
[59:14] little bit. Um but that's okay because I
[59:18] realized that afterwards that I was
[59:21] supposed to be there to sit next to him
[59:23] because he would have been interrupting
[59:24] this other conversation that was going
[59:26] on on the other side of the table.
[59:29] And so I'm listening and I got included
[59:33] a little bit in in the conversation and
[59:36] stuff, but you know, when my food's
[59:37] before me, I'm not much of a talker.
[59:40] Like, let's eat. I'm I'm ready to eat.
[59:44] And and I look and I look at brother
[59:46] Amos' thing and his his knife and fork
[59:48] is still in the napkin. And I'm
[59:50] thinking, this guy, he's not going to
[59:52] eat his food. And the more that I'm
[59:55] listening to the conversation, the more
[59:58] that he's testifying and he's talking
[1:00:00] about the grace of God and he's talking
[1:00:02] about God over here at a business
[1:00:03] meeting and he's talking about God over
[1:00:05] there and then all of a sudden the three
[1:00:07] of them have their phones out and he
[1:00:11] This is just amazing. He has them with
[1:00:14] their phones out on a Bible app reading
[1:00:17] scripture
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; at a restaurant.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; At a business meeting.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so I'm thinking, "This
[1:00:24] is amazing." So I take my phone out and
[1:00:27] I'm not on my Bible app, but I'm
[1:00:29] videoing everything that's going on here
[1:00:32] because my food is done. I really
[1:00:35] enjoyed it.
[1:00:37] And so I'm just videoing these guys and
[1:00:40] I'm thinking, "This is absolutely
[1:00:43] amazing."
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Absolutely amazing. And I thought, here
[1:00:48] we are at a business meeting and you're
[1:00:52] supposed to be talking business in order
[1:00:53] to win more business. But here he is
[1:00:56] talking about the Lord and not caring
[1:00:59] about the business.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Now, why is that? It's because he told
[1:01:03] me afterwards, you know, how can God do
[1:01:05] something for you and you not share it
[1:01:08] with other people?
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; He didn't get so caught up with uh uh
[1:01:13] what are they going to think about me
[1:01:14] and what of this and what of that? No,
[1:01:16] there was just a love in his heart to
[1:01:19] share the gospel with these two
[1:01:20] gentlemen who ended up they were uh I
[1:01:24] think they were from Iraq and but they
[1:01:26] were Iraqi Christians. And so they
[1:01:30] started sharing stuff back and all of a
[1:01:32] sudden this this this business meeting
[1:01:35] it turned into a gospel meeting and I
[1:01:38] thought well praise the Lord. How many
[1:01:40] of us would do the same thing? How many
[1:01:43] of us when when we go to work and we
[1:01:45] have meetings and and wherever it is
[1:01:47] that life takes us on a day-to-day
[1:01:48] basis, how many of us are actually
[1:01:51] willing to step out and and share about
[1:01:54] the faith that God has placed in our
[1:01:56] hearts? Cuz the Bible says this, don't
[1:01:59] hide your light under a bushel.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to let it shine.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Well, how do you let it shine? You let
[1:02:06] it shine by declaring the gospel of
[1:02:09] Jesus Christ. So, let me encourage you.
[1:02:12] Don't be shy and don't be scared. Don't
[1:02:15] be scared of the consequences. Cuz if
[1:02:17] you don't get a pay raise because of
[1:02:19] your love for Jesus Christ, well, so be
[1:02:22] it.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; If you don't get a job because of your
[1:02:25] love for Jesus Christ, so be it.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; You don't want that pay raise and you
[1:02:30] don't want that job anyways.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Pretty amazing.
[1:02:38] We ought to have that same purpose that
[1:02:40] Daniel had in his life. Daniel purposed
[1:02:44] in his heart that he would not defile
[1:02:47] himself
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; with the king's meat or with his wine.
[1:02:52] He told the unic, "Give me 10 days. 10
[1:02:55] days and we'll see who's greater." the
[1:02:58] food that's anointed by God through
[1:03:00] sanctification and prayer or the food of
[1:03:03] the kings from the king's very table
[1:03:06] itself. And we all know the outcome of
[1:03:08] the story. But it came because Daniel
[1:03:11] had purposed within his heart and he had
[1:03:14] a true revelation within his heart that
[1:03:17] he was different than everybody else.
[1:03:20] That he was called to be a sanctified
[1:03:23] vessel unto God. that he was called to
[1:03:26] be set aside and ready for service for
[1:03:29] God's service.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; We should take a leaf from Daniel's book
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; and understand the hour that we're
[1:03:38] living in and to understand how easy it
[1:03:41] is in this this this present evil world
[1:03:45] that we're living in where Satan is the
[1:03:47] the ruler of principalities. He's the
[1:03:50] ruler of powers. He's the ruler of this
[1:03:52] of this of this earth as we know it. We
[1:03:55] have to understand that if we don't
[1:03:57] purpose within our hearts
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; to say I am not going to be defiled by
[1:04:04] Leodysia. I am not going to be defiled
[1:04:07] by the spirits of this end time. If you
[1:04:10] don't purpose it in your own heart, you
[1:04:12] will be defiled.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Your spirit will be defiled. Your heart
[1:04:18] will be become hardened towards God.
[1:04:21] Your spirit will be hardened towards
[1:04:23] God's word, towards God's people, to our
[1:04:26] families, to our friends, to our
[1:04:28] children and loved ones. Why? Because we
[1:04:31] lose the purpose within our hearts.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; It's a it's a it's like a an act of duty
[1:04:40] that we all have to perform.
[1:04:43] starting here to the very back of the
[1:04:45] church. We've got to wake up in the
[1:04:47] morning and purpose in our heart and
[1:04:49] say, "I'm not going to defile myself by
[1:04:52] unclean things.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to defile myself by by
[1:04:57] Instagram and YouTube and and all these
[1:05:00] different things." No, but I'm going to
[1:05:02] cleanse myself and I'm going to purpose
[1:05:04] to stay clean in the word of God. Amen.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; But if you don't purpose it,
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; if you don't make that active decision
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; and say, "This is what I'm going to do
[1:05:16] today and this is what I'm not going to
[1:05:19] let happen today." Satan Satan will take
[1:05:22] your mind and it'll become the devil's
[1:05:24] playground.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Satan will take your spirit. Just watch.
[1:05:29] If you don't if you don't have the
[1:05:30] shield of faith up, if you don't have
[1:05:33] the helmet of salvation upon your head,
[1:05:36] all you got to do is go to the wrong
[1:05:38] restaurant one time and all you got to
[1:05:40] do is listen to the music and then go
[1:05:43] from there to the mall and go from there
[1:05:46] to someone somewhere else and and go
[1:05:48] from there and see all of these unclean
[1:05:51] spirits that surround us on a daily
[1:05:54] basis. Praise brother.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; And then all of a sudden what happens to
[1:05:58] our spirits?
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; What happens to our heart? It becomes
[1:06:02] defiled
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; and it becomes hardened and it and it
[1:06:06] happens and we don't even realize it.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham said uh the
[1:06:14] invasion of the United States,
[1:06:17] it's not a physical invasion, but the
[1:06:20] invasion is already on.
[1:06:22] understand that Satan is the one who is
[1:06:25] invading and and and and he is taking
[1:06:28] away our joy, taking away our peace,
[1:06:31] taking away the joy of the Lord within
[1:06:34] our hearts, and we don't even recognize
[1:06:36] that it's Satan that's doing it.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we've lost a purpose within
[1:06:41] our hearts to say no. We've lost a
[1:06:43] purpose within our hearts to to say, you
[1:06:46] know what? I'm going to stay clean
[1:06:48] today.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay pure. I'm going to
[1:06:51] keep my thoughts right,
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; going to keep my heart right. I'm going
[1:06:55] to meditate upon the word of God. I'm
[1:06:57] going to sing sing the songs of Zion.
[1:07:00] I'm going to sing uh uh uh psalms and
[1:07:03] and so on and so forth.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take captive my very
[1:07:08] thoughts
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; by the word of God.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Why? How do you do it? You purpose
[1:07:14] within your heart.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; You make a decision.
[1:07:18] But so much of the time, you know, we're
[1:07:21] like, we're like a we're like a a log
[1:07:24] that that gets blown over into the water
[1:07:27] and it's just drifting down the water.
[1:07:31] Well, I'm a believer and praise the Lord
[1:07:33] and and God is good and I've had an
[1:07:35] experience with God and and life is good
[1:07:37] and life is fantastic and we just drift
[1:07:40] through life.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; We become a piece of driftwood. You know
[1:07:44] what happens to a piece of driftwood?
[1:07:48] It gets stuck.
[1:07:51] All of a sudden, there's a corner and
[1:07:53] the corner becomes tight and all of a
[1:07:55] sudden this this piece of driftwood, it
[1:07:57] gets it gets stucked and it gets jammed.
[1:08:01] Why? Why do we get stuck and jammed in
[1:08:04] our lives? We get stuck and we get
[1:08:06] jammed because we lose our purpose. We
[1:08:09] we fail to purpose in our hearts to
[1:08:12] continue with the Lord. And we might not
[1:08:14] be exactly living in sin, but we're just
[1:08:17] drifting.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; We're just drifting. We're just going
[1:08:22] with the flow. We're just waiting for
[1:08:24] the coming of the Lord. And in our in
[1:08:26] our waiting, we become drifters. And in
[1:08:29] our drifting, we get stuck. What happens
[1:08:32] to a piece of driftwood that gets stuck
[1:08:34] and it stays in the water for long
[1:08:36] enough?
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; It begins to rot.
[1:08:40] True.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; What happens to you and I when we become
[1:08:44] drifters. Amen. And we get stuck in
[1:08:47] life. This piece of wood that was once
[1:08:50] that was once a tree. Amen. It was once
[1:08:53] a tree that was planted by the rivers of
[1:08:56] water. A tree that used to bring forth
[1:08:58] fruit. A tree that used to bring forth
[1:09:00] life. All of a sudden it's cut down. It
[1:09:02] starts drifting and it becomes rotten.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Where did it start? It started when we
[1:09:08] failed to purpose. Oh, let me get the
[1:09:10] thought across to you.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; It started when we failed to purpose in
[1:09:15] our hearts.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; To stay in the word of God to live our
[1:09:19] lives according to his word and not just
[1:09:22] drift down the sea of Leodysa.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Drifters. I don't want to be a drifter.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; I don't want to I don't want to drift
[1:09:34] through Leodysia. No. But I want to
[1:09:37] produce. I want to grow. I want to be
[1:09:39] planted by the water. I don't want to be
[1:09:40] overtaken. I want to be planted by the
[1:09:43] water. And I want to bring forth fruit.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I love him.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; You know, the only way for a piece of
[1:09:53] driftwood to get out of the water is for
[1:09:56] someone to take it out.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Let's start preaching.
[1:10:03] How do we get a piece of driftwood out
[1:10:05] of the water? How
[1:10:08] we go to it? Let me say my that piece of
[1:10:12] driftwood that don't belong there. It
[1:10:15] would look better in my house.
[1:10:18] People pay big money for driftwood.
[1:10:21] Stuff like that. It's wild.
[1:10:24] But it takes somebody that understands,
[1:10:27] hey, that doesn't belong in there.
[1:10:29] There's a cause and effect because of
[1:10:31] this piece of wood that's within this
[1:10:33] water. And somebody's got to take it
[1:10:35] care enough. Take it, pull it out that
[1:10:38] the water might run freely and that that
[1:10:40] piece of wood doesn't begin to rot. How
[1:10:42] many people do you know who are stuck
[1:10:44] because of them and drifting in their
[1:10:46] lives? They're stuck in their in their
[1:10:48] spiritual life. They're stuck in their
[1:10:50] natural life. They're stuck with their
[1:10:52] walk with their walk with God. And you
[1:10:54] can see it written all over them. I
[1:10:56] wonder how many times do we just look at
[1:10:58] it and pass by?
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Do we just look at it and say, "Well,
[1:11:03] there's a piece of driftwood. There's
[1:11:04] another person struggling. We'll just
[1:11:06] we'll just let them drift on. We'll just
[1:11:08] we'll just keep them stuck because I
[1:11:10] don't want to get involved in anybody
[1:11:12] else's business."
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; You know what's amazing?
[1:11:18] People will watch
[1:11:20] people will pull out their phones and
[1:11:23] they'll watch something terrible happen
[1:11:25] to somebody on the street.
[1:11:28] They'll they'll if they see a man abuse
[1:11:30] physically abusing a woman or physically
[1:11:32] abusing a little one of their children
[1:11:34] or whatever it may be or there's a fight
[1:11:37] on the street or who knows, put up your
[1:11:40] own story in your mind. Instead of
[1:11:43] people helping, instead of somebody
[1:11:46] reaching out and saying, "Hey guy, you
[1:11:49] probably shouldn't be hitting that
[1:11:50] woman, knock it off. Split up the
[1:11:54] fight." Instead, instead of getting
[1:11:56] involved and and and and taking care of
[1:11:59] it and helping somebody, people would
[1:12:01] rather pull out their phones and take a
[1:12:03] video.
[1:12:05] Have you ever been on an accident on the
[1:12:07] road and you think, "Oh my," or you've
[1:12:10] gotten a flat tire or something's
[1:12:12] happened and you think, "There'll be
[1:12:14] somebody for sure out of the six, seven
[1:12:17] million people here that's in the valley
[1:12:19] that's going to pull over and help me in
[1:12:21] this situation.
[1:12:22] Instead, they want to pull out their
[1:12:24] phones.
[1:12:26] Look at that person. They just got in a
[1:12:28] car wreck. Look it. Look it." They would
[1:12:31] rather take a video of somebody in need
[1:12:34] instead of helping the person in need.
[1:12:37] Why? Because the mentality is, well,
[1:12:39] it's none of my business.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; I ain't getting involved in that. That
[1:12:45] that's that's their life. That's their
[1:12:48] deal. I'm talking spiritually also.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; I'm talking within the church. I'm
[1:12:53] talking within our families. That's none
[1:12:55] of my business. I'm just going to let
[1:12:58] that lie. and they can figure it all out
[1:13:00] themselves when really all they need is
[1:13:03] someone to put away their phone to stop
[1:13:06] videoing what's going bad and take
[1:13:09] action and help.
[1:13:14] My,
[1:13:16] it's amazing.
[1:13:18] You know, brother uh Matthew Aaron, his
[1:13:21] his coworker,
[1:13:23] uh his coworker just died there last
[1:13:26] week. And and if you need someone to
[1:13:29] pray for, we ought to pray for for this
[1:13:31] for that gentleman's wife. Here she is.
[1:13:34] She's eight months pregnant.
[1:13:36] And from my understanding, this this
[1:13:38] this this man, he he he was at a bar or
[1:13:42] whatever it was and bumped into a girl
[1:13:44] and you know, I'm sorry, didn't mean for
[1:13:46] that to happen. Excuse me. The night
[1:13:48] went on, he left wherever establishment
[1:13:52] it was. And three men followed him out
[1:13:57] and one of them sucker punched him in
[1:13:58] the back of the head. And when they hit
[1:14:00] him on the back of the head and his head
[1:14:02] hit the ground, his forehead, he was
[1:14:04] brain dead instantly.
[1:14:09] Saints of God, we don't know when our
[1:14:12] last moment of time is.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; We don't know what's going to happen in
[1:14:18] our lives. And here's this guy
[1:14:22] and and and just from a worldly uh point
[1:14:25] of thinking, I suppose, because I've
[1:14:27] been there. I've been in those
[1:14:29] situations. I've been the one that got
[1:14:31] sucker punched and I've been the one
[1:14:33] that has sucker punched others. But and
[1:14:36] I and I and I put myself in this
[1:14:38] situation and I think how many how many
[1:14:41] people did that person have they have
[1:14:43] they punched before?
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; You know, no doubt he took two friends
[1:14:47] with him. Big big tough guy. But no
[1:14:50] doubt has happened more than one time.
[1:14:52] And all of a sudden, it took one silly
[1:14:55] mistake, one silly punch, one silly uh
[1:14:59] uh moment of overreacting of something
[1:15:02] real real dumb. Let me just put it that
[1:15:05] way. And all of a sudden, that person
[1:15:07] becomes a murderer.
[1:15:10] Let me ask you something. Is it worth
[1:15:12] the overreaction?
[1:15:15] It's not worth it.
[1:15:17] Now he has he has ruined the life of
[1:15:19] that woman and and their unborn child
[1:15:21] that'll be born in the next three or
[1:15:23] four weeks. He's ruined his own life.
[1:15:25] They've ruined they killed somebody.
[1:15:28] What's the point? Let me ask you
[1:15:31] something.
[1:15:33] If you were to know what tomorrow holds,
[1:15:37] if you were to know your last your last
[1:15:40] your last minute and hour upon this
[1:15:42] earth, would you worry and stress so
[1:15:46] much about the little things in life?
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; If you knew your moment was right now,
[1:15:53] if you knew your moment was in one
[1:15:55] hour's time, would you be worrying about
[1:15:57] the little the little petty issues
[1:16:00] within the church? Would you be worrying
[1:16:03] about the little petty issues within
[1:16:05] your own life and with your own family
[1:16:07] and and so on and so forth that No, you
[1:16:11] wouldn't. Chances are, here's what you
[1:16:14] would do. You would go and you would
[1:16:16] make the petty issues right.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; So, we ought to be living our lives.
[1:16:22] Amen. according to if this is the last
[1:16:26] minute that I'm on planet Earth.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; What would you do if this was your last
[1:16:31] minute? Who would you call to make
[1:16:33] things right? What would you do after
[1:16:36] the service this morning?
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Go do it.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Because you know it's worth doing.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense?
[1:16:48] But the longer we leave things, it fers
[1:16:51] and and and it becomes an issue and and
[1:16:54] and and and
[1:16:56] if you leave an infection unattended, it
[1:16:59] gets worse and it gets worse and it gets
[1:17:02] worse.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; A lot of times
[1:17:08] we are our lives become infected
[1:17:13] because of the life that we're living.
[1:17:15] Our
[1:17:18] lives become infected because of the
[1:17:21] life that we're living in and the way
[1:17:22] we're treating our bodies.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Our spiritual life becomes infected. And
[1:17:29] if we don't change something,
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; if we don't change something within our
[1:17:33] lives, if we don't change something
[1:17:35] within our diet, it only gets worse. The
[1:17:38] infection gets worse. So it is
[1:17:41] spiritually. If we leave infections in
[1:17:44] our spiritual life unattended and we
[1:17:46] don't do something about it, it just
[1:17:48] fers and it gets worse. God help us to
[1:17:53] do what we know we need to do.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, I say this morning and I I'm
[1:17:59] talking to myself this morning even also
[1:18:02] because I'm going to make a call after
[1:18:03] service as well.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; It's so amazing. Yeah.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; You begin to preach and and and you go
[1:18:12] down a little rabbit trail and all of a
[1:18:13] sudden there's there's n there's there's
[1:18:16] a name in my heart
[1:18:20] that I'm preaching to myself.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; That's how I know it's not the man, but
[1:18:26] it's God.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; I know I know someone that I need to
[1:18:32] reach out to that I haven't spoken to in
[1:18:34] quite a long time.
[1:18:37] I got no hatred. I got no animosity, but
[1:18:39] I need to do it.
[1:18:42] You know, sometimes a simple I'm sorry,
[1:18:44] even when you know, and this is pride
[1:18:47] speaking, perhaps you know you're not
[1:18:49] even in the wrong.
[1:18:52] But it takes and you think, well, why
[1:18:54] should I apologize and make something
[1:18:56] right
[1:18:58] if I'm not the one in the wrong? You
[1:19:01] know what that's called? It's called
[1:19:03] pride.
[1:19:05] And pride is something that all of us
[1:19:07] need to swallow.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:13] Ah, thank you, Lord.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; so we realize that Nebuchadnezzar has
[1:19:20] this dream and and Daniel is the only
[1:19:24] one in the kingdom that's able to
[1:19:26] interpret this dream to him. And we
[1:19:28] realize that this was not just a dream,
[1:19:32] but this this dream that Nebuchadnezzar
[1:19:34] had. It was a prophecy.
[1:19:37] It was a it was it was a prophecy of a
[1:19:40] of a dispensation.
[1:19:42] It was a prophecy of a gentile
[1:19:44] dispensation. So, it wasn't just a dream
[1:19:48] that troubled him, but a dream
[1:19:50] interpreted. Brother Brandham said is
[1:19:52] prophecy. So here was Nebuchadnezzar and
[1:19:56] he has this dream and Daniel comes along
[1:19:59] and he and he and he and he gives the
[1:20:01] interpretation of this dream and we
[1:20:03] realized that that that this was a this
[1:20:06] was the beginning to the ending of the
[1:20:09] gentile dispensation.
[1:20:12] So, brother Brandham would take this
[1:20:15] take this portion of scripture
[1:20:18] and he would say right at this very time
[1:20:21] of Nebuchadnezzar and and and Daniel and
[1:20:24] this dream that he had of of the head of
[1:20:26] gold that went down to the legs of iron
[1:20:29] and and feet of iron and clay that that
[1:20:33] that this head of gold who was
[1:20:36] Nebuchadnezzar was the beginning of the
[1:20:39] gentile dispensation.
[1:20:42] So if you want to know the beginning of
[1:20:44] it, here it is. Because from the head of
[1:20:47] gold where it began to the to the to the
[1:20:50] legs and the feet of iron and clay to
[1:20:53] where it gets struck by the rock that
[1:20:55] was that was sheun out of the mountain
[1:20:57] but with no hands
[1:21:00] from the beginning to the ending. It was
[1:21:03] a dream of the of the gentile
[1:21:06] dispensation.
[1:21:07] And so we understand that even though it
[1:21:10] was the beginning to the ending of this
[1:21:12] dispensation, it is not where the
[1:21:14] dispensation of the bride began. It's
[1:21:18] where the Gentiles began of when God
[1:21:21] first left Israel and now he's he's
[1:21:24] beginning to do things through the
[1:21:27] Gentiles.
[1:21:28] And it's so amazing to me that when you
[1:21:31] look at this dream and and you look at
[1:21:33] the the head of gold and the and and and
[1:21:35] and the breastplate of of of silver and
[1:21:39] so on and so forth, it's amazing to me
[1:21:41] that that we could read that that very
[1:21:44] same passage of scripture and we would
[1:21:47] say, well, we could get a vision of it
[1:21:49] in our mind but have absolutely no
[1:21:52] understanding of what it means.
[1:21:55] That's why we need a a prophetic
[1:21:57] message. And I am so glad for that
[1:22:00] prophetic message in this day that that
[1:22:02] a prophet could look with prophetic
[1:22:05] insight and say, "Here's the beginning
[1:22:07] and here's the ending and here's the the
[1:22:10] the journey from the beginning to the
[1:22:12] ending."
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Me and you just look at it, we say, "My,
[1:22:17] that's quite a dream."
[1:22:19] Even though we would have the Holy
[1:22:21] Ghost, it still takes the inspiration of
[1:22:25] a prophet's message.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; What's interesting is this, the gentile
[1:22:35] dispensation, it begins at the top and
[1:22:37] it works its way to the bottom. Starts
[1:22:40] with the head of gold. It ends with the
[1:22:42] with the with the 10 toes. Eastern and
[1:22:45] Western countries.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; It it and the total destruction of it is
[1:22:49] when there's this this this this rock or
[1:22:52] this stone or whatever you want to call
[1:22:54] it that's that that wasn't made by
[1:22:56] hands. You see, this rock is Christ. It
[1:23:00] wasn't made by hands. It wasn't it
[1:23:02] wasn't made by human intellects, but it
[1:23:05] was it was tuned out and it was carved
[1:23:08] specifically by God himself. And the
[1:23:10] ending of this gentile dispensation is
[1:23:13] when that rock returns, that stone
[1:23:16] returns and it smites the image
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; and it smites that image so hard that it
[1:23:21] breaks it into powder.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; But whenever God begins to talk begins
[1:23:31] to deal with the dispensation of the
[1:23:33] bride, he starts from the bottom and he
[1:23:37] works his way up.
[1:23:40] Why is it that this image that this
[1:23:42] image gets crushed? Its foundation is
[1:23:45] not good enough.
[1:23:47] Because the feet is a mixture of iron of
[1:23:51] clay and iron and clay does not mix
[1:23:54] together. Therefore, the foundation of
[1:23:56] it is weak.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; But when God begins with the
[1:24:01] dispensation of the bride, what does he
[1:24:03] begin to do? He starts at the bottom
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; because the foundation is the most
[1:24:08] important part of the structure.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; If the foundation is wrong, the
[1:24:13] structure will be wrong. And uh the
[1:24:16] apostle Paul said, I I I'm a great
[1:24:19] master builder. I've laid a foundation.
[1:24:22] Watch there on how you build upon this
[1:24:25] foundation.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this in questions
[1:24:31] and answers. Brother Brandham um 19th
[1:24:35] chapter and the 18th verse yet have I
[1:24:37] kept 7,000 of Israel 7,000 in Israel all
[1:24:41] haven't bowed to Ba and every or bowed
[1:24:44] to Baal which was not which has not
[1:24:46] kissed him mouth who has not kissed him
[1:24:48] explain this for me the 700 it was 7,000
[1:24:52] see kissing Baal how many here was
[1:24:54] formerly Catholic see you kiss images
[1:24:57] and remember in the time of Babylon and
[1:24:59] Nebuchadnezzar when the gentile kingdom
[1:25:01] was issued in. See, when the gentile
[1:25:03] kingdom issued in, it come in by worship
[1:25:06] of a man. Nebuchadnezzar made a statue
[1:25:09] of a man. If you've got a spiritual
[1:25:11] mind, now listen to this revelation.
[1:25:14] That spirit that that that man that he
[1:25:17] had made a revelation of, he made an
[1:25:20] image of by his revelation was Daniel, a
[1:25:23] religious man being worshiped. See,
[1:25:25] because he named him Belchesar,
[1:25:27] which was the name of his god, and to
[1:25:29] and he made an image of that god, which
[1:25:32] was the image of Daniel. And Daniel
[1:25:34] refused to bow to his own image. See,
[1:25:36] and here it is again. Now, watch. The
[1:25:38] gentile kingdom was issued in in the
[1:25:40] days of Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar,
[1:25:42] a gentile king, putting his church and
[1:25:44] state together by taking an image of a
[1:25:47] holy man and forcing worship to it. The
[1:25:50] gentile kingdom ends in the feet with
[1:25:52] the handwriting on the wall by a
[1:25:54] political power that's united church and
[1:25:56] state together to force kissing images
[1:25:58] again you see the same thing image of a
[1:26:02] holy man. Now you might say, "Well,
[1:26:05] brother Stephen, are we is that talking
[1:26:08] about brother Brandham and is that
[1:26:09] talking about his ministry? How that
[1:26:11] people will worship the uh worship the
[1:26:14] man rather than the lamb?" You can you
[1:26:16] could put it there, but that's not what
[1:26:18] brother Brham is talking about because
[1:26:20] he says it was by a forcing
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; by a forcing of kissing the image by a
[1:26:26] forcing of of of of taking of coming
[1:26:29] under this this uh worldwide religion. a
[1:26:33] forcing of bowing. I want to tell you
[1:26:36] something. I am not forced to believe
[1:26:38] this message.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Nobody forces me. Nobody ties my hand
[1:26:42] behind my back. Nobody makes me come to
[1:26:44] church. Nobody makes me listen to the
[1:26:46] message. No, I'm not forced to do
[1:26:48] anything. But I am compelled by God.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; I am compelled by God through the love
[1:26:53] of God. That's why I follow this
[1:26:56] message.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Nobody forces me. Nobody makes me do it.
[1:27:01] Nobody makes me live my life this way.
[1:27:04] No, I do it because I am surrounded and
[1:27:07] I am compelled by the very love of God
[1:27:10] himself.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Don't misinterpret my love for the Lord
[1:27:18] and my love for this message as worship
[1:27:21] for the man.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; It was the forcing. It was a uniting of
[1:27:31] church and of state.
[1:27:33] Nebuchadnezzar, he brought the church
[1:27:36] and the state together and he united it.
[1:27:39] And he was so caught up with the gift in
[1:27:42] and Daniel's life is this is the man and
[1:27:44] his God we're going to worship. And if
[1:27:46] you don't bow down to the statue of him,
[1:27:48] you're going to end up in the lion's den
[1:27:50] or you're going to end up in a in a
[1:27:52] burning furnace. You need to bow the
[1:27:55] knee. So, brother Brandham takes this
[1:27:58] story now of it's a let me say it like
[1:28:01] this a prefigure of what was to happen
[1:28:04] to the gentile church.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; He takes it now as a prefigure and he
[1:28:10] says as it began, it's going to end.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; It began with the forcing of the worship
[1:28:17] of a man and it's going to end with the
[1:28:20] forcing of the worship of the man with
[1:28:22] the handwriting on the wall. You see how
[1:28:25] important it is for you and I to be able
[1:28:28] to look at the handwriting on the wall
[1:28:30] and to be able to interpret what it
[1:28:33] means.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; It was a prefigure that what would be
[1:28:40] done at the council of Nia 325 AD when
[1:28:45] Constantine now would take the church in
[1:28:48] the state.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; What church age is that?
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Third church age. the marrying of church
[1:28:55] and state. He now brings it together. He
[1:28:59] marries them together. And by doing so,
[1:29:01] what did he do? This this this Roman
[1:29:05] kingdom,
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; this pagan Roman kingdom of of it wasn't
[1:29:10] Babylon, but it was Rome that had a that
[1:29:12] that this beast was was wounded onto
[1:29:15] death.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Rome had fallen. Rome had conquered all
[1:29:19] of the world.
[1:29:21] She was the legs of iron.
[1:29:23] But all of a sudden now this wound which
[1:29:26] which was wounded onto death by its fall
[1:29:29] now was re revived by Constantine
[1:29:34] by maraging of the church
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; and of the state and this beast this
[1:29:40] spirit that went around and and killed
[1:29:43] and destroyed and took over took over
[1:29:46] the entire world almost. Yes sir.
[1:29:50] The spirit that was in that beast was
[1:29:52] now revived and it was no longer pagan
[1:29:55] Rome. But now it was called papel Rome.
[1:30:00] So no longer was it paganism as as you
[1:30:03] would call it. It was paganism disguised
[1:30:08] in Christianity.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; If I could put it like this. Satan
[1:30:14] changed his mask. That's right.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; We talk about God changing his mask and
[1:30:20] God and Morpha and God and Morpha over
[1:30:23] here and over there and now it's God and
[1:30:25] Morphe and us. But understand Satan does
[1:30:27] the same thing. So now Satan changes his
[1:30:31] mask
[1:30:32] in this third church age because in the
[1:30:36] first three church ages, remember he was
[1:30:38] a white horse rider.
[1:30:40] first church age. He he he went out and
[1:30:43] and he rode and he was conquering and uh
[1:30:45] sent out to conquer and
[1:30:48] no arrows.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Want to do much with no arrows?
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; What good is a bow with no arrows? It
[1:30:54] seems so seems so simple. It seems so
[1:30:58] innocent. But yet now that spirit would
[1:31:01] begin to uh get worse and worse and he
[1:31:04] would and he would begin to change his
[1:31:07] mask as time goes on. And as time goes
[1:31:10] on, sin it multiplies and it gets worse
[1:31:12] and it gets worse. So then all of a
[1:31:14] sudden he he this this spirit on this
[1:31:17] white horse rider, he ends up he's he's
[1:31:20] crowned with a triple crown.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden he he's kingly.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; He's something that can be worshiped.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; And when he gets to that stage where he
[1:31:32] has where he has church and state in his
[1:31:35] hands, he can take over the whole world.
[1:31:37] He changes his form once again.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; He changes his horse. It's the It's the
[1:31:44] same spirit.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; The same spirit in Babylon was the same
[1:31:49] spirit with the Mes and Persians. The
[1:31:51] same spirit with the Grecians. The same
[1:31:53] spirit in Rome. Now it's in the church.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; You see, Satan is always wanting to
[1:32:01] intermingle with the seed of God. Yeah,
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; he did it in the garden.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; He mingled his seed in with the children
[1:32:11] of God.
[1:32:13] And then when God be to birth his
[1:32:16] church,
[1:32:18] now Satan, he couldn't let that happen.
[1:32:21] So what does he do now? He begins to
[1:32:22] mingle himself in with the church until
[1:32:26] we get to a point of Matthew 24:24
[1:32:29] that it would deceive the very elected
[1:32:33] if it were possible. Why? Because it
[1:32:36] would be so close to the truth. Surely
[1:32:39] thou shalt not.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; So close to the truth, but yet be a
[1:32:46] complete lie.
[1:32:49] So, Satan begins to change his form. He
[1:32:54] changes his mask. But yet, it's the same
[1:32:57] Satan with the same power. And once he
[1:33:00] once he has in his hand church and
[1:33:02] state, now he says, "Now you're going to
[1:33:05] bow to me.
[1:33:08] And if you don't bow to me, I will make
[1:33:11] you bow."
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, Christianity takes a
[1:33:15] whole other form.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:18] Let me ask you, if you were to look at
[1:33:20] the church of Ephesus, of the church of
[1:33:24] Pentecost, and then look at the the the
[1:33:27] the first church, the Catholic church
[1:33:30] where it was united and it was brought
[1:33:31] together under Constantine. If you were
[1:33:33] to look at the fruits of the two
[1:33:35] churches, which one is more like God?
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Good question.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; There's one. There's one that is
[1:33:43] long-suffering and one that loves, one
[1:33:45] that knows how to bring the right kind
[1:33:48] of offering, but then there's one all
[1:33:51] they want to do is to seek, destroy, and
[1:33:54] to kill. Who does that remind you of in
[1:33:57] the Garden of Eden?
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; So all you have to do is look at the
[1:34:01] fruits of what the spirit is producing.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Then you can understand what kind of
[1:34:07] spirit it is.
[1:34:12] Exposition of the seven church ages,
[1:34:14] Pergamian church age. Brother Brandham
[1:34:15] says, "People look at Rome. They look at
[1:34:18] the nation of Italy and as they look
[1:34:19] they do not realize that Rome with her
[1:34:22] strict confines where the pope has an
[1:34:24] actual area as his domain is literally a
[1:34:26] nation within a nation. And she has
[1:34:29] ambassadors and receives ambassadors.
[1:34:31] Papal false Christian Rome. She is even
[1:34:34] called the eternal city. How
[1:34:36] blasphemous. now controlled by religion
[1:34:39] even more aly than when pagan imperial
[1:34:42] Rome controlled by the pure force pure
[1:34:45] iron of force. Rome took on a new lease
[1:34:48] of life when Constantine joined church
[1:34:50] and state and backed the union by force.
[1:34:52] The spirit that motivated pagan Rome is
[1:34:55] the same spirit that now motivates false
[1:34:58] Christian Rome. So, the same spirit that
[1:35:00] was in pagan Rome is the same spirit,
[1:35:04] same uh pagan uh idolatrous spirit
[1:35:08] that's in paple Rome.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; How do you know? All you got to do is
[1:35:14] look at the fruits of what it produced.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; This is astounding.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; It's amazing.
[1:35:24] And it's not just a history. understand
[1:35:27] that. You know, I used to read my church
[1:35:30] aids book and and my seven seal book and
[1:35:33] I would think, well, this is pretty
[1:35:36] amazing and and I would think to myself,
[1:35:40] this is nothing but church history.
[1:35:43] You know, you know that God, and brother
[1:35:45] Brandham says this in the seventh seal,
[1:35:47] he says that God,
[1:35:50] whenever God was revealing, and I'm
[1:35:52] paraphrasing it because some of you are
[1:35:53] going to He didn't say it just like
[1:35:55] that. Brother Steven sent,
[1:35:59] paraphrasing it.
[1:36:01] Okay, I think it's paragraph 328,
[1:36:04] something in around here. I've been
[1:36:05] reading it. But brother Brandham says
[1:36:07] this. He says that God didn't give him
[1:36:11] that he didn't understand the reason of
[1:36:14] the blast and all those things that were
[1:36:15] happening. He said he was scared that he
[1:36:17] was going to die. And the day of and the
[1:36:21] day before that the seal was to be
[1:36:23] opened, that the seal was to be loosed
[1:36:25] and revealed, he didn't know what it
[1:36:27] was. He said, "God didn't give it all to
[1:36:30] me at once. He gave it to me as I had
[1:36:33] need of it."
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Understand? God does the same thing with
[1:36:36] you and I. We might not understand
[1:36:39] everything and we might not be able to
[1:36:41] explain everything of the message and
[1:36:43] all the doctrines and so on and so
[1:36:45] forth, but I'll say this, God will give
[1:36:48] it to you as you have need of it.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; So back here I'm thinking it's just it's
[1:36:55] a history of the church and this is a
[1:36:57] nice book, but as as as I had need of
[1:37:00] the revelation. Now God begins to deal
[1:37:03] with my heart and say, "This is a lot
[1:37:04] more than church history, but this is
[1:37:07] reading between the lines and
[1:37:09] recognizing the spirits that are driving
[1:37:12] the church."
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Because when you recognize the spirit by
[1:37:17] the fruit that it produces, when you
[1:37:19] recognize a nickelan spirit, you can say
[1:37:22] that person's nickel.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; How do you know? Cuz he's trying to
[1:37:26] divide and conquer the leoty. They're
[1:37:28] trying to come between me and my family,
[1:37:31] my friends, whatever it may be.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; So when you read with a spiritual
[1:37:36] understanding,
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; the whole thing lights up
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden our discernment
[1:37:43] awakens.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; I told the church, the the the youth the
[1:37:47] other the other week, like we need to
[1:37:49] stop walking around with our head in the
[1:37:52] sand and use some discernment.
[1:37:57] use some discernment of the things that
[1:37:58] we see of spirits and and and and and
[1:38:00] and all the different things that affect
[1:38:03] us in our lives and and just and stop
[1:38:06] just using things as an excuse, but to
[1:38:09] have some spiritual understanding, to
[1:38:12] have some spiritual discernment and
[1:38:14] recognize these things and be able to
[1:38:17] say, "Ha, I know not to go down that
[1:38:19] way."
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; How do you know? Because I recognize and
[1:38:23] I can discern where it's going to lead
[1:38:25] me. Amen.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; So if we are to use spiritual
[1:38:29] discernment and to and with choices and
[1:38:32] decisions that we are to make, our lives
[1:38:35] would be a whole lot better.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we just
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; we're drifting, aren't we?
[1:38:47] Continuing on, you can see that this is
[1:38:50] so because now know that the fourth
[1:38:52] empire never went out of existence. He's
[1:38:54] talking about Rome. It just changed in
[1:38:57] its outer texture. Once the Nyine
[1:39:00] Council had swung the power of political
[1:39:02] Rome to the church, it seemed that there
[1:39:04] were no limits to which the first
[1:39:06] Christian church would go. The name
[1:39:08] Christian which originally brought uh
[1:39:11] brought persecution now became the name
[1:39:14] of the persecutors.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; That's correct. At one point they Saul
[1:39:20] he came after those who called
[1:39:22] themselves Christians and he persecuted
[1:39:24] them. But now all of a sudden the name
[1:39:26] Christian they became the persecutors.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said this that bride
[1:39:33] cannot persecute bride.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; So therefore if we see someone out here
[1:39:41] they say they're a message believer and
[1:39:43] they're just persecuting everybody
[1:39:45] that's within the bride.
[1:39:48] We can look at the spirit and we can
[1:39:50] look at the fruits of the life and we
[1:39:52] can say not of the original Christian
[1:39:55] church.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Spiritual discernment.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; We can discern the fruit on the tree
[1:40:05] and then we can understand if we should
[1:40:08] partake of that tree or not. Amen.
[1:40:12] That's true, isn't it?
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; It is. But if you can't discern the
[1:40:17] fruit, whether it's good or bad of the
[1:40:19] tree, you're going to partake of it. And
[1:40:20] once you partake of it, now that that
[1:40:23] fruit now becomes a part of what you are
[1:40:26] and you become a part of the fruit and
[1:40:29] then what happens, saints of God, let me
[1:40:30] tell you what happens. Our spirits get
[1:40:33] defiled.
[1:40:35] Father, help us.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:41] The name Christian which originally
[1:40:42] brought persecution now became the name
[1:40:44] of the persecutors. It was in this age
[1:40:46] that Augustine of Hippo set forth the
[1:40:49] precept that the church ought and must
[1:40:52] use force to ne if necessary to bring
[1:40:55] her children back into the fold and if
[1:40:57] and that it was in harmony with the word
[1:41:00] of God to kill the heretics and
[1:41:02] apostates.
[1:41:04] So now when I look at this and I and I
[1:41:08] read this, I think to myself, the
[1:41:11] original Catholic Church, they if they
[1:41:14] had to, they would use fear in order to
[1:41:17] get a conversion.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; So now I think about it within my own
[1:41:21] mind and use some kind of discernment.
[1:41:24] And now I think to myself, wow, that's
[1:41:27] no way for a father to raise his
[1:41:28] children.
[1:41:31] If a father treats his children this
[1:41:33] way, he's treating his children
[1:41:35] according to the Roman Catholic Church.
[1:41:37] And the spirit behind that church is the
[1:41:40] spirit that was in pagan Rome. So
[1:41:42] therefore, if we're raising families
[1:41:45] according to fear, we're raising them
[1:41:47] according to paganism. Amen.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; If the pastor or the preacher is
[1:41:54] preaching a message due to fear, what
[1:41:58] what is the spirit that is driving
[1:42:00] behind that minister and behind that
[1:42:03] message? It is not the spirit of God.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Spiritual discernment. Follow along with
[1:42:12] me.
[1:42:14] Um in his controversy with uh don
[1:42:19] donatists he wrote it is needed better
[1:42:22] that man should be led to worship God by
[1:42:25] teaching man that they should be driven
[1:42:27] to it by fear of punishment or pain but
[1:42:29] it does not follow that because the
[1:42:32] former course produces better I think I
[1:42:34] skipped something should be led no I
[1:42:36] didn't therefore those who do not yield
[1:42:39] to it should be neglected for many have
[1:42:42] found advantage as we have proved and
[1:42:43] our daily proving by actual experience
[1:42:47] and being first compelled by fear or
[1:42:49] pain so that they might afterwards be
[1:42:51] influenced by teaching so that they
[1:42:54] might follow out and act what they have
[1:42:56] already learned in word. Whilst those
[1:42:59] are better who are guided a right by
[1:43:02] love, those are certainly more numerous
[1:43:05] who are corrected by fear.
[1:43:08] They're even saying it themselves
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; that being directed by love. And
[1:43:14] remember last Sunday, brother Bradom
[1:43:16] says that chastisement is not for
[1:43:19] punishment, but it's to bring out a
[1:43:21] better end.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; So it all depends on the spirit that's
[1:43:25] driving it.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Because if it's by fear, we realize that
[1:43:30] it's actually a spirit, a pagan spirit.
[1:43:33] But if it's by if it's by love because
[1:43:36] we want to bring an expected end for the
[1:43:39] person because we love them and we want
[1:43:42] to guide them in the right way. There
[1:43:44] it's the spirit of God. Therefore it all
[1:43:48] depends on the spirit that's driving the
[1:43:51] person
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; and a lot of times the person will not
[1:43:55] know nor understand nor discern the
[1:43:59] because we are blinded to ourselves.
[1:44:03] But it takes it takes the discernment of
[1:44:07] the people to watch and to understand
[1:44:10] the heart and the spirit that's driving
[1:44:12] the person. Does that make sense?
[1:44:16] So therefore, what that means is that is
[1:44:19] that us as the ley, we're not just
[1:44:22] supposed to sit around and just and just
[1:44:27] just be like a garbage can and open the
[1:44:29] lid and everything that goes in is is
[1:44:31] okay.
[1:44:32] We're supposed to use discernment.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; And you know what, saints of God, let me
[1:44:36] say this. That's why I go to this
[1:44:39] church. That's why I call brother Ron my
[1:44:43] pastor because I can see the spirit that
[1:44:45] has led the man throughout all these
[1:44:46] years.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; And it's a and I believe it to be the
[1:44:50] spirit of Christ.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; But we got to use spiritual discernment.
[1:45:01] He says here, "It's more numerous who
[1:45:04] are corrected by fear. For who can
[1:45:06] possibly love us more than Christ who
[1:45:08] laid down his life for the sheep?" Yet
[1:45:09] after calling Peter and the a and the
[1:45:12] other apostles by words alone, when he
[1:45:14] came to summon Paul, he not only
[1:45:16] constrained him by his voice, but even
[1:45:17] dashed him to the earth with his power,
[1:45:20] and that he might forcibly bring one who
[1:45:22] was raging amidst the darkness
[1:45:24] infidelity to desire the light of the
[1:45:26] heart. He first struck him of physical
[1:45:27] blindness to the eyes. Why therefore
[1:45:30] should not the church use force on
[1:45:31] compelling her lost sons to return? The
[1:45:34] Lord himself said, "Go out into the
[1:45:35] highways and hedges and compel them to
[1:45:37] come in." Wherefore, if the power which
[1:45:39] the church has received by divine
[1:45:40] appointment in its due season through
[1:45:42] the religious character and faith of
[1:45:44] kings, be the instrument by which those
[1:45:46] who are found in the highways and
[1:45:47] hedges, that is in heresies and and
[1:45:50] schisms, are compelled to come in, let
[1:45:53] then let them not find fault with being
[1:45:56] compelled.
[1:45:58] It was at this moment of time around
[1:46:01] this time that this horse rider now
[1:46:03] changes from the white horse now to the
[1:46:06] red horse from the third church age to
[1:46:09] the fourth church age. But as he is
[1:46:12] changing his mask all of a sudden now
[1:46:14] God changes his mask. The Bible says
[1:46:17] that I'll raise up a standard as the
[1:46:20] enemy comes in like a flood. I will
[1:46:22] raise up a standard against that enemy.
[1:46:26] So now he changes from a lion to a
[1:46:28] burden, an a a beast of burden, which is
[1:46:32] an ox. Now we go through 1,200 years or
[1:46:35] whatever it is of dark ages.
[1:46:43] We have a a video here that I would like
[1:46:46] to play. If we could play that,
[1:46:48] brethren, please. And this is this is
[1:46:51] really interesting to me.
[1:46:54] This is just here last Wednesday.
[1:47:03] Look what these guys are doing.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Look.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Before you meet the Pope, you've got to
[1:47:12] bow and kiss his ring.
[1:47:42] These guys are so excited to meet the
[1:47:44] Pope.
[1:47:53] And you'll see they have a gift for him
[1:47:55] here in the background.
[1:48:02] A white horse
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; and his name is Proton.
[1:48:09] He's got that wild stare, doesn't he?
[1:48:13] Sure
[1:48:16] does.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; I think God is trying to show us
[1:48:23] something here.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; This is an Arabian horse that was gifted
[1:48:33] to the Pope because he loves horses.
[1:48:48] Watch how happy he is here.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:08] Thank you, brother.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; I thought this was a real interesting
[1:49:14] video.
[1:49:15] And you know the name Proton. Does
[1:49:19] anybody know what it means in the Greek?
[1:49:22] It means the first.
[1:49:25] So now here is this pope being gifted a
[1:49:28] white horse and his name is Proton which
[1:49:32] means the first. And so we understand by
[1:49:36] spiritual revelation and we've been
[1:49:38] alluding to it a little bit this morning
[1:49:41] of how that first horse rider he rode on
[1:49:44] a white horse. And so now here is this
[1:49:48] pope and he's been given this white
[1:49:50] horse and his name is the first and and
[1:49:53] it's a a resemblance if you ask me of of
[1:49:56] the first white horse rider that begin
[1:49:58] to ride. Now what we've been speaking
[1:50:01] about is that that the rider never
[1:50:04] changes.
[1:50:06] the white horse rider, the the red horse
[1:50:09] rider, the black horse rider, and the
[1:50:11] pale horse rider. It is all the same
[1:50:14] rider that is riding the horses. He just
[1:50:17] changes his horse. Now, and this is just
[1:50:21] pure speculation, and I'm just throwing
[1:50:23] this out there for you and I to think
[1:50:26] about these things, to think about the
[1:50:28] handwriting, which is on the wall
[1:50:30] because that's my sermon title. um and
[1:50:33] to understand the day and hour in which
[1:50:35] we're living in. Could it be that we
[1:50:38] have just as Christ we say he is alpha
[1:50:41] and he is omega, he has the omega bride
[1:50:44] now that is that is coming coming
[1:50:47] together with Christ once again. The
[1:50:49] alpha and omega now joining to be one.
[1:50:53] Are we at so close to the end time when
[1:50:56] this pale horse rider begins to ride
[1:50:59] that this is the last pope
[1:51:02] that we have now the first and the last
[1:51:05] now uniting together? Then we we know
[1:51:08] that when that pale horse rider begins
[1:51:11] to ride his name is death. He's the only
[1:51:16] horse that has a name and hell follows
[1:51:19] him. But I'm so thankful to God that
[1:51:22] when that pale horse rider begins to
[1:51:25] ride and and his name is death and hell
[1:51:27] follows him that the bride is already
[1:51:29] gone.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Because when he steps forth to claim
[1:51:34] those who he has redeemed already, the
[1:51:38] day the day of of of mercy and grace is
[1:51:41] done with, judgment is striking the
[1:51:43] earth and the bride who is a
[1:51:45] representation of the blood is taken up.
[1:51:47] So therefore, when that happens, Satan
[1:51:50] himself is incarnate in a man. He begins
[1:51:53] his ride on a pale horse and death and
[1:51:57] hell follow him.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; I wonder. It's pure speculation.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Pure speculation, but it's worth a
[1:52:05] thought.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; What if? Brother Brandon would say,
[1:52:09] "What if?" He would say, "Sers, is this
[1:52:12] the time?" He would say, "These these
[1:52:14] souls that are in prison now, is this
[1:52:17] the time?
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Is this where we are? Has time ended?"
[1:52:21] He was speculating. He was asking the
[1:52:24] question, "Therefore, I believe that I
[1:52:25] have grounds to do the same thing to
[1:52:28] you." To think this handwriting is on
[1:52:32] the wall all around us. And what is the
[1:52:35] handwriting telling us? How close to the
[1:52:38] coming of the Lord are we?
[1:52:45] Man, I got a lot left.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said this. Brother
[1:52:51] Brandham said he was supposed to meet
[1:52:53] the pope. You remember?
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; But what is the thing that he would not
[1:52:57] do?
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't bow and he wouldn't kiss his
[1:53:00] ring. He said, "I bow to one. That's
[1:53:03] Jesus Christ."
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; You see all these men up here bowing the
[1:53:07] knee, kissing his ring, and they're so
[1:53:09] happy about it. The Bible says that
[1:53:11] people will be deceived to believe a lie
[1:53:15] and to be damned by it.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Thank God that he hasn't given us an eye
[1:53:21] to be deceived by a lie, but he's given
[1:53:24] us an eye and a heart to receive the
[1:53:26] truth.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; The Gentile dispensation began with the
[1:53:33] forcing of the worship of a holy man and
[1:53:37] it ends the same way.
[1:53:40] forcing of a holy man of kissing images
[1:53:45] and bowing before holy images. Wow. 2
[1:53:49] Thessalonians 2 1-4 says, "Now we
[1:53:52] beseech you, brethren, by the coming of
[1:53:53] our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our
[1:53:55] gathering together uh unto him that you
[1:53:57] be not soon shaken in mind, or be
[1:53:59] troubled, neither by spirit nor by word,
[1:54:01] nor by letter, as from us, as that the
[1:54:03] day of Christ is at hand. Let let no man
[1:54:05] deceive you by any means, for that day
[1:54:06] shall not come, except there come a
[1:54:09] falling away first, and that man of sin
[1:54:10] be revealed the son of predition, who
[1:54:12] opposes and exaltth himself above all
[1:54:14] that is called God, or that is
[1:54:16] worshiped, so that he as God siteth in
[1:54:18] the temple of God, showing himself that
[1:54:20] he is God. In Satan's Eden 1965, that
[1:54:24] deceitfulness of the church today, the
[1:54:26] son of predition, the devil, the son of
[1:54:28] predition, the devil, then people
[1:54:30] worshiping Satan in this day thinking
[1:54:32] they're worshiping God.
[1:54:34] What do these men think they're doing?
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; They think they're worshiping God
[1:54:38] because here's this holy man, the vicor
[1:54:41] of Christ. Here he is in the state of
[1:54:43] Christ. A holy man, this this Catholic
[1:54:46] church that has lasted for all of these
[1:54:48] years.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Surely it must be right.
[1:54:53] Nonsense.
[1:54:55] He says they think they're worshiping
[1:54:57] God, but they're worshiping Satan.
[1:55:00] They're worshiping him through a creed,
[1:55:02] a man-made denominations and creeds has
[1:55:05] brought the people right down to the
[1:55:06] greatest deception that the world has
[1:55:08] ever known of. No matter how much of the
[1:55:11] word promised for this day is preached
[1:55:13] and vindicated, they still won't believe
[1:55:15] it.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; They still won't believe it. Why is
[1:55:18] that? Why why won't they believe it?
[1:55:20] Because some people just can't believe
[1:55:22] it.
[1:55:27] Okay, let me keep let me try to stay
[1:55:29] focused here.
[1:55:31] Oh yeah. Okay.
[1:55:34] Um Daniel 5:es 3-6. Then they brought
[1:55:37] the golden vessels that were taken out
[1:55:39] of the temple of the house of God which
[1:55:40] was at Jerusalem. And the king and his
[1:55:42] princes, his wives and his concubines
[1:55:43] drank in them. They drank verse four
[1:55:46] wine and praised the gods of gold, of
[1:55:48] silver, brass, of iron, of wood, and of
[1:55:49] stone. And in the same hour came forth
[1:55:51] fingers of a man's hand and wrote over
[1:55:53] against the candlestick upon the plaster
[1:55:55] of the wall of the king's palace. And
[1:55:56] the king saw the part of the hand that
[1:55:58] wrote. Then the king's countenance was
[1:56:00] changed and his thoughts troubled them
[1:56:01] so that the joints of his loins were
[1:56:03] loosed and his knees smoked one against
[1:56:06] the other. Understand these vessels that
[1:56:08] we're talking about here, they were
[1:56:09] taken from the house of the Lord, from
[1:56:11] the temple of the Lord um that was
[1:56:13] dedicated by Solomon. And when Solomon
[1:56:15] dedicated this temple, and we all know
[1:56:17] the story that the glory of God filled
[1:56:19] the temple, but the glory of God did not
[1:56:21] fill the temple until the priests
[1:56:23] brought these vessels, these cups of of
[1:56:26] gold and stuff. When the priests brought
[1:56:28] these vessels of gold and silver and so
[1:56:30] forth into the temple, it was the it was
[1:56:33] the last it was the last thing to take
[1:56:36] his position within the temple before
[1:56:38] God filled the temple with his presence.
[1:56:41] And so, what are you and I? You and I
[1:56:43] are vessels of the Lord. We are vessels
[1:56:46] that are made onto honor. So now these
[1:56:48] vessels, they were made onto honor were
[1:56:50] now put in the wrong hands and they were
[1:56:53] used for the wrong thing. And so we know
[1:56:55] that by predestination that we were
[1:56:58] always vessels of gold. We were always
[1:57:00] vessels of honor because that's how God
[1:57:02] made us. But when we were born through
[1:57:04] our parents through through an act of
[1:57:07] sin and conception, understand that
[1:57:10] these vessels of gold that you and I are
[1:57:12] was placed into the wrong hands of
[1:57:14] Satan. Amen.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; So now whenever these whenever these
[1:57:19] vessels they they took these vessels and
[1:57:22] they and they begin to drink from them.
[1:57:25] I read a commentary and it said that
[1:57:27] whenever a whenever a a a kingdom was
[1:57:30] was um defeated that the the the
[1:57:35] conquerors would take the vessels of the
[1:57:37] gold and the certain things out of the
[1:57:39] temple of their gods and they would take
[1:57:41] it into their own temples. And what they
[1:57:43] would do is they it would be a a a a
[1:57:47] prideful show of act of of that they
[1:57:49] were the conquerors and that this God
[1:57:51] was conquered. Now we can and and that
[1:57:55] that's also in the scripture of where
[1:57:57] remember the Philistines took the ark of
[1:57:59] the Lord.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Where did they put the ark of the Lord?
[1:58:03] They put it in with Deeon their God.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; And what happened to Deeon their God?
[1:58:08] Came in one day. was laying face over
[1:58:11] and there was an arm cracked off and you
[1:58:13] all know the story and all of a sudden
[1:58:16] they realized who's God was real
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; whose God was really God and it was at
[1:58:22] this time whenever they began to show
[1:58:24] mockery towards God and drinking from
[1:58:27] the the sanctified vessels that were
[1:58:30] ordained of God for a purpose to serve
[1:58:33] within the temple. God had had enough.
[1:58:38] God is not mocked.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; He'll not be knock mocked by us and
[1:58:42] he'll not be mocked by Satan.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; So all of a sudden he says, "I've had
[1:58:47] enough of this." And the fingers now the
[1:58:49] handwriting now begins to draw upon the
[1:58:52] walls. understand in your life a vessel
[1:58:56] of honor unto God. A vessel that has
[1:58:58] been prepared for God for the service of
[1:59:01] God in this hour in which we're living
[1:59:03] in when God had enough of the mockery of
[1:59:06] you being in the wrong hands of Satan.
[1:59:09] All of a sudden, he sent your way the
[1:59:12] supernatural in order to bring you out
[1:59:14] of the wrong kind of hands and to to use
[1:59:17] you for his glory.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:22] So all of a sudden the supernatural was
[1:59:24] upon the people or was around the people
[1:59:28] and they didn't understand it.
[1:59:31] What means this this I see a hand and I
[1:59:35] see this writing in an unknown tongue. I
[1:59:37] I don't understand. There was
[1:59:39] handwriting on the wall and there was
[1:59:41] nobody there that understood the
[1:59:43] handwriting or no one there that was
[1:59:45] able to interpret the handwriting that
[1:59:47] was upon the wall.
[1:59:50] But there was one man there by the name
[1:59:52] of Daniel who was able to interpret the
[1:59:55] handwriting and was able to show to the
[1:59:58] king the future events in his life.
[2:00:01] Little did he know it would be that
[2:00:03] night that his life would be taken. Now
[2:00:06] brother Brandham says uh just once more
[2:00:09] Lord he's talking about Sam Samson an
[2:00:12] outstanding servant of God. Now he
[2:00:14] stands there humiliated blind weakened a
[2:00:16] disgraced. It's a picture of a
[2:00:17] demoralized sunken generation. It's a
[2:00:20] picture of a nation that's lost its hold
[2:00:21] with God. It's a picture of a church
[2:00:23] that's lost its hold on God's word
[2:00:25] because that's what Samuel what Samson
[2:00:28] represented here. Humiliated, broken. It
[2:00:33] kind of reminds us of this United States
[2:00:35] of America that we're living in right
[2:00:36] now, doesn't it? Humiliated, broken. He
[2:00:40] was in a terrible condition as he sat
[2:00:42] there or stood there rather. He so could
[2:00:44] you imagine him standing this great man
[2:00:46] that one time he could what he could do
[2:00:48] and here he is standing here in that
[2:00:49] condition humiliated as I said broken a
[2:00:52] symbol that I want to declare tonight
[2:00:54] this symbol represents the very hour
[2:00:56] that we're now living the condition of
[2:00:58] the church now broken out of the word of
[2:01:01] the Lord humiliated out of its place and
[2:01:04] the question is coming today the
[2:01:06] handwriting is on the wall and who can
[2:01:08] read it they know nothing about it
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:01:13] They under they saw the handwriting on
[2:01:17] the wall. It was the supernatural God
[2:01:20] that was beginning to reveal himself
[2:01:22] supernaturally, but there was no one
[2:01:24] there that understood what it said
[2:01:27] because they didn't understand uh
[2:01:29] spiritual things. They were all they
[2:01:31] were so caught up with partying. They
[2:01:34] were so caught up with the drinking and
[2:01:36] the women and the concubines and and and
[2:01:38] having a a big day and a big life to
[2:01:40] where when the supernatural was
[2:01:42] presented to them. When the when the
[2:01:45] handwriting was was upon the wall and it
[2:01:48] was presented to them, they were so
[2:01:50] caught up with worldly affairs that they
[2:01:52] didn't understand supernatural or
[2:01:54] spiritual things. And brother Brandon
[2:01:57] would would take that now and he would
[2:01:59] type it to the day in which he was
[2:02:01] living in. and he would actually type it
[2:02:04] to the days of of Elvis Presley because
[2:02:07] Elvis Presley all of a sudden came to
[2:02:09] fame in 1957, whatever it was, and and
[2:02:13] he began to sing these songs and America
[2:02:15] began to go wild with rock and roll and
[2:02:18] and partying and creating records and so
[2:02:21] on and so forth to where they forgot
[2:02:23] their god-given rights. They they forgot
[2:02:26] who they were and they now were
[2:02:28] beginning to be used as vessels of
[2:02:30] dishonor.
[2:02:32] And brother Brandham uses this very
[2:02:34] statement. He says, he says, Belshazar
[2:02:37] was all shook up
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; because his joints and his legs and his
[2:02:44] knees were loosed
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; and he began his knees began to quake.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; He was all shook up.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; This is astounding.
[2:02:56] Have any of you ever saw Elvis Presley
[2:03:00] and how he dances? and how he would
[2:03:02] swing his hips and how he would move his
[2:03:04] knees. If you haven't, that's good. You
[2:03:07] don't need to go look it up.
[2:03:11] But brother Brandham is is typing now.
[2:03:14] Remember remember the handwriting is on
[2:03:17] the wall as the Gentile dispensation
[2:03:20] started. It's going out not just with
[2:03:23] the worship of a man, but now he's tying
[2:03:26] together where Elvis Presley being all
[2:03:29] shook up and he's he's he's paralleling
[2:03:32] that to Belshazar.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; And so we try to tell ourselves it
[2:03:37] doesn't matter what kind of music we're
[2:03:39] listening to. I beg to differ.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; See, it's a Christian song sang by Elvis
[2:03:48] Presley.
[2:03:51] What kind of spirit is behind it?
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Sometimes, saints of God, we need to be
[2:03:58] careful of what we're listening to.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; And the spirit that's behind the person.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:10] Because then all of a sudden, you know,
[2:04:12] you know what church becomes? Church, it
[2:04:13] becomes uh contemporary worship.
[2:04:18] We don't want contemporary worship. We
[2:04:20] want worship.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; We don't want rock and roll Christian
[2:04:23] music. No, we want we want hymns and and
[2:04:26] and stuff that's pleasing to God and
[2:04:28] things that have been wrote written by
[2:04:30] people that have had a testimony.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Well, yeah. Music is a
[2:04:38] I don't know much about music. I'm not a
[2:04:40] musician and I'm not a singer. Neither
[2:04:42] am I a song leader. But I am spiritual
[2:04:45] enough to understand that certain songs
[2:04:49] shouldn't be played in our cars,
[2:04:51] shouldn't be played in our homes, and we
[2:04:53] shouldn't sing them in church.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we do or not. Just
[2:04:56] saying. Okay.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; That's something for you all to think
[2:05:00] about.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let me keep going. I know I'm
[2:05:04] going long. I'm sorry.
[2:05:08] The wise man didn't astrologers
[2:05:11] astrologers couldn't explain it. the
[2:05:13] handwriting that was on the wall. The
[2:05:15] women that was present, they had no idea
[2:05:17] of what it meant. You see, the the the
[2:05:20] wise things of God are understood by
[2:05:22] wise men of God. And spiritual things
[2:05:25] are given to spiritual people who will
[2:05:27] understand the spiritual and the
[2:05:29] supernatural. Okay? Brother Brandham's
[2:05:32] life, just stay with me for a little
[2:05:33] bit. Brother Brandham's life was a a
[2:05:36] supernatural life. And this this life,
[2:05:40] you know what it was? Brother Brandham's
[2:05:42] life was God's handwriting
[2:05:46] all over the walls of Leodysia
[2:05:50] because the supernatural is to do two
[2:05:51] things. Number one is to catch the
[2:05:53] attention of the people and number two
[2:05:55] is to show us that impending judgment is
[2:05:57] coming.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; It's the whole way through the scripture
[2:06:00] that God always sends the supernatural
[2:06:03] to save one and to condemn the other.
[2:06:06] And so now when we begin to see this
[2:06:08] this supernatural life of of of brother
[2:06:11] Brandham, this seventh church age
[2:06:13] messenger, what is it showing us? It is
[2:06:15] showing us that that God is on the scene
[2:06:18] and it is showing us that the
[2:06:20] handwriting is on the wall and that
[2:06:22] impending judgment is near. That's what
[2:06:25] the handwriting is saying to Leodysia.
[2:06:28] But who can read it
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; and who can understand it?
[2:06:34] We've had 1,200 sermons of God's
[2:06:36] handwriting
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; all over the walls of Leodysia giving a
[2:06:41] warning before judgment. And it all
[2:06:43] comes down to this very point that we
[2:06:45] are at the ending of this gentile
[2:06:48] dispensation.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; What are all these things showing? What
[2:06:52] what does it mean? What is the
[2:06:54] handwriting on the wall? What are these
[2:06:56] 1,200 sermons? What do they mean? It
[2:06:59] means that that that this world has been
[2:07:01] found in the balances has been weighed
[2:07:04] and found wanting.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; It's been weighed in the balance of
[2:07:08] God's word and it's been found too
[2:07:11] light. It's been found too heavy. It's
[2:07:13] not a perfect balance.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; So therefore, he sends the supernatural
[2:07:19] in order to get our attention that God
[2:07:22] is going to do something. And when he
[2:07:24] sends the supernatural, it is a sign of
[2:07:27] impending judgment. Their handwriting is
[2:07:31] all over the wall. We could spend we
[2:07:33] could spend the rest of the day talking
[2:07:35] about the scriptures that have been
[2:07:37] fulfilled in this day of Revelations
[2:07:39] 10:7, Malachi 4:56 in the book of
[2:07:42] Zechariah. Behold, it'll be light at the
[2:07:44] evening time. And we could go on and on
[2:07:46] and on and we could go through the
[2:07:48] scriptures and we could go through the
[2:07:49] types and the shadows of of the bride
[2:07:51] and the bridegroom and this and that and
[2:07:53] and you begin to realize how much
[2:07:56] scripture is being has been fulfilled in
[2:07:58] this day in which we are living in.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; What does it mean?
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; It's handwriting. It's on the wall. But
[2:08:07] not everybody can interpret the
[2:08:08] handwriting. only a select few who have
[2:08:11] been taught by a prophetic message to
[2:08:14] realize that this handwriting means we
[2:08:17] have been been weighed in the balances
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; and this world is found wanting
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; handwriting on the wall and so have you
[2:08:29] got an example of what God did uh he's
[2:08:32] talking about Daniel talking to
[2:08:33] Belshazar before him there um and you so
[2:08:38] have you got an example example of what
[2:08:40] God did to those who didn't walk upright
[2:08:42] before him. These are not mysterious
[2:08:44] things. This is not a hard message. It's
[2:08:47] the truth. You've got an example. You
[2:08:49] know what he did back yonder to the
[2:08:50] women who danced before the idols. You
[2:08:52] know what he did to the men who went
[2:08:54] after strange women. You know what he
[2:08:55] did to the drunken s and the homosexuals
[2:08:58] and the perverts of Sodom. It's it's no
[2:09:00] strange thing. You know these things.
[2:09:02] You should have known it. That's your
[2:09:04] example by your grandfather. But now
[2:09:05] this is the meaning of the writing. God
[2:09:07] has numbered your kingdom. You are
[2:09:08] weighed in the balance and found
[2:09:09] wanting. Oh, if there was ever a time
[2:09:11] that Methodists, Baptists,
[2:09:12] Presbyterians, Luther, Pentecostals,
[2:09:14] they are weighed in the balance, God's
[2:09:16] balance, and found wanting. They've
[2:09:17] called the spirit of the living God an
[2:09:19] unholy thing. And they've done despite
[2:09:21] to the works of grace, they have
[2:09:22] followed big churches and organizations.
[2:09:24] You assemblies of God, you church of
[2:09:26] God, all you witness, trinitarians,
[2:09:28] Baptist, Presbyterian, Catholic, you
[2:09:31] know you've gone back to Babylon.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; You had the example of that. And this
[2:09:36] random tabernacle knows that you've been
[2:09:38] warned of those things years ago, but
[2:09:40] now you're weighed in the balances and
[2:09:42] found wanting,
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; fussing,
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; fighting, holding grudges
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; and stewing.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; And you think God could work in a place
[2:09:52] like that?
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[2:09:56] I love how brother Brandham brings it
[2:09:58] into the Brandham Tabernacle
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; because he's not just pointing fingers
[2:10:02] out here that everybody else has found
[2:10:03] has been weighed and found wanting, but
[2:10:05] now he brings it personally to the
[2:10:07] Brandham Tabernacle. And so then I take
[2:10:09] it to myself and I say, "Okay, can I
[2:10:12] take this to me? And how is my weight in
[2:10:15] and in in God's balance? Am I balanced
[2:10:17] or have I been found wanting?"
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Fussing, stewing,
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; fighting,
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; envy,
[2:10:26] He says, he says, "You think God could
[2:10:30] work in a place like that? Never. There
[2:10:33] you are."
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; What a powerful thought.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; As a musician's come,
[2:10:40] we'll bring this to a close.
[2:10:43] I wonder if God was to weigh you and I
[2:10:45] this morning in his bal in his in his
[2:10:48] balances. I wonder how we would be
[2:10:50] found.
[2:10:54] Brother Brandham talks about Pearl
[2:10:55] Harbor and
[2:10:58] there's about 11 quotes in Pearl Harbor
[2:11:01] and uh
[2:11:04] he talks about Pearl Harbor and what had
[2:11:06] happened and how that it was such a
[2:11:08] catastrophe and such a such a a bad
[2:11:11] thing that had happened and and and how
[2:11:14] that he says they were caught off guard.
[2:11:19] And he then goes on to say that he had
[2:11:22] read an article and and we all
[2:11:24] understand the story of Pearl Harbor,
[2:11:26] but he had read an article and and he
[2:11:29] found out that the people of Pearl
[2:11:31] Harbor were not necessarily found uh
[2:11:34] they were found wanting.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; They knew of the impending judgment.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; They knew that the Japs were going to
[2:11:46] attack.
[2:11:48] They knew that uh they had word that the
[2:11:50] Japanese fleet was forming in the in the
[2:11:53] sea there and and they were getting
[2:11:55] troops together and that they were they
[2:11:57] were forming a formation and there was
[2:11:59] planes coming and they were they were
[2:12:01] getting their stuff all together because
[2:12:03] they've been planning this attack on
[2:12:05] Pearl Harbor.
[2:12:07] And brother Brandham says he he says
[2:12:09] follow along with me. And he talks about
[2:12:12] it and he says you know they knew of the
[2:12:15] impending disaster that was coming. They
[2:12:18] knew of an attack that was being planned
[2:12:22] but yet they failed to plan to defend
[2:12:25] themselves.
[2:12:27] He says because they were all so caught
[2:12:29] up with the boogie woogie music. They
[2:12:33] were so caught up with the dancing and
[2:12:35] the partying. in and he goes on and he
[2:12:37] dramatizes it and he says, "Did you hear
[2:12:40] of the rumor that the Japanese are
[2:12:43] planning to attack us and they were at a
[2:12:45] bar and there was a girl that sat up on
[2:12:47] the bar and she said, "Oh, don't you
[2:12:49] know that we've come here for a good
[2:12:52] time, not to talk about war." And all of
[2:12:56] a sudden, their their minds were
[2:12:59] sidetracked. from the generals down to
[2:13:02] the floor sweepers.
[2:13:04] All they had in their mind was a great
[2:13:06] big party was worldly things and worldly
[2:13:10] affairs and concubines and dancing and
[2:13:12] so on and so forth. And they would say,
[2:13:14] "Well, it's just a rumor. It's just a
[2:13:17] rumor. It's not going to happen. Let's
[2:13:20] have a good time because we're here for
[2:13:23] a good time, not for a long time."
[2:13:26] And we know that because they they
[2:13:29] failed to prepare themselves for the
[2:13:31] oncoming judgment. Though the
[2:13:33] handwriting was on the wall,
[2:13:37] though they were able to interpret the
[2:13:39] handwriting, but yet they classed it as
[2:13:42] a rumor, they were able to read it and
[2:13:45] say, "The Japanese are forming. They've
[2:13:47] got their fleets out there. They've got
[2:13:49] bombers. They've got so forth and so on.
[2:13:51] They're preparing to attack us."
[2:13:54] But yet instead of getting ready, though
[2:13:58] they heard the message,
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; though they understood the message,
[2:14:03] yet they got sidetracked and they failed
[2:14:07] to purpose in their heart to do what
[2:14:10] they were sent to do.
[2:14:13] And we all know the story and how it
[2:14:15] ends and how the rumors were true.
[2:14:19] The rumors were true. The Japanese were
[2:14:22] forming. They were getting their planes.
[2:14:25] They were getting uh the things that
[2:14:27] they needed to attack Pearl Harbor. And
[2:14:30] it ended up being a true story. And when
[2:14:32] you go to Pearl Harbor and and you go
[2:14:35] and you see the ship that is sunken
[2:14:37] there and and you think to yourself, my
[2:14:42] my my my could have been prevented
[2:14:46] if only they would have been at their
[2:14:49] right place in their right position
[2:14:52] doing what they were what they were what
[2:14:54] they were trained to do.
[2:14:58] What about you and I, my brother, my
[2:15:01] sister? We've heard the coming of the
[2:15:05] Lord draws nigh. We've seen the
[2:15:07] handwriting on the wall. We've seen the
[2:15:09] supernatural. We've recognized the
[2:15:11] supernatural. But just because many
[2:15:13] years have passed, that doesn't mean
[2:15:15] that the Lord has put off his coming.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz understand this, the rumor is true.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; The handwriting is on the wall. It's all
[2:15:25] around the walls of Leodysia.
[2:15:28] But I just wondered this morning, are we
[2:15:31] like those at Pearl Harbor? And though
[2:15:34] we've heard these things for many years
[2:15:36] and and we've been preparing for many
[2:15:38] years, I wonder are we just getting a
[2:15:41] little bit lax in our preparation
[2:15:44] for the coming of the Lord?
[2:15:49] Such a sombering thought
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; and it's something that only you can
[2:15:55] answer and it's something that only I
[2:15:58] can answer for myself also. I know this
[2:16:02] I can do much better.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here this morning that
[2:16:06] you would say, you know what, I can do
[2:16:08] much better, brother Stephen. And you
[2:16:10] would like to stand with me and you
[2:16:12] would like to say, yeah, I've heard it.
[2:16:15] I see the handwriting on the wall. I
[2:16:18] understand it. I'm able to interpret it,
[2:16:20] but I know that I can do better, Lord. I
[2:16:24] know that I can do better in my
[2:16:26] servantthood. I know that I can prepare
[2:16:28] just a little bit more, Lord. And so,
[2:16:30] Father, as we pray together,
[2:16:33] how about you lift your hands and you
[2:16:36] pray to God. And as I'm praying, I want
[2:16:39] you to pray. And I want you to pray from
[2:16:41] your heart as I pray from my heart.
[2:16:44] Father God,
[2:16:47] in the name of Jesus Christ, we present
[2:16:50] ourselves before you, Lord. And Father
[2:16:53] God, I want to I want to say that I'm
[2:16:55] sorry, Lord, because I know that I'm
[2:16:59] capable of so much more, Father. I know,
[2:17:03] Lord, that I'm capable of of getting of
[2:17:06] getting ready and preparations, Lord,
[2:17:08] because we've seen the handwriting on
[2:17:10] the wall, Father. We know that the
[2:17:12] rumors are true. Father, we know that
[2:17:15] you're coming, Lord, as a thief in the
[2:17:17] night. And so, Father, I'm asking you
[2:17:20] this morning that you would give us the
[2:17:22] grace, the grit, the determination,
[2:17:25] Lord, the discipline to do what we need
[2:17:28] to do, Father, to do what we know we
[2:17:31] should be doing, Lord. Father God, not
[2:17:34] not pointing at the at the driftwood
[2:17:36] that's in the water, but helping get
[2:17:38] that driftwood out of the water, Father.
[2:17:40] And Lord, if we are that piece of
[2:17:42] driftwood, I pray that's just drifting
[2:17:44] down La Leo to see it. Lord, I ask that
[2:17:47] you would come by and that you would
[2:17:48] pick us up, Lord, and bring us out of
[2:17:50] this this water that has us that has us
[2:17:53] stalled on the river banks, Father God.
[2:17:56] Father God, I I commit this sermon to
[2:17:59] you. And though it was perhaps a little
[2:18:02] a little cut up, Lord, and but Lord, I I
[2:18:04] I felt like you I know you placed it on
[2:18:07] my heart. I know the time and the place
[2:18:11] where I was and what I was doing when
[2:18:13] you placed it on my heart, Lord.
[2:18:15] Therefore, I know that this sermon was
[2:18:18] for somebody. Lord, help us to prepare
[2:18:21] and to get ready, Lord. For we've seen
[2:18:23] the handwriting on the wall. We've seen
[2:18:26] Revelations 10 1-7. We know the book has
[2:18:29] been opened, Lord, and we believe it
[2:18:31] with all our hearts. Now, Father, may we
[2:18:33] be watching and waiting for thy soon
[2:18:35] coming, for we know it comes as a thief
[2:18:37] in the night. Give us strength, we pray.
[2:18:40] Help us, Lord. Help us to follow through
[2:18:43] with those things that you're dealing
[2:18:45] with in our hearts, even at this very
[2:18:47] moment. Father God, I love you and
[2:18:50] commit this this people into your hands,
[2:18:56] Lord. Use everyone for thy kingdom's
[2:18:58] glory. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[2:19:00] ask these favors. Amen.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:19:09] pleasing,
[2:19:11] [Applause]
[2:19:12] oh Lord,
[2:19:14] unto you.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Let's start from the top.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; Let me be pleasing.
[2:19:27] Let me be pleasing
[2:19:32] to you
[2:19:34] in everything
[2:19:37] that I do.
[2:19:41] Be pleasing
[2:19:45] to you.
[2:19:49] Praise.

[2:19:57] I pursue
[2:20:01] be pleasing,
[2:20:04] oh Lord,
[2:20:06] unto you.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:20:16] Wonder if we could sing that song. Uh
[2:20:18] Psalms 24,
[2:20:20] I believe it is. I sought the Lord and
[2:20:23] he answered me.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; I sought the Lord
[2:20:31] and he answered me
[2:20:36] and deliver me
[2:20:40] from every fear.
[2:20:44] Those that look for me
[2:20:47] [Music]
[2:20:48] for radio,
[2:20:52] they'll never be ashamed.
[2:20:56] Will never be ashamed.
[2:20:59] This poor man, this poor man.
[2:21:05] And the Lord heard me
[2:21:09] and save me from
[2:21:13] my enemy.
[2:21:17] The son of God
[2:21:21] surrounds his saint.
[2:21:25] He will deliver them.
[2:21:29] Who will deliver?
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Magnify.

[2:25:27] for God. He talked about a vessel this
