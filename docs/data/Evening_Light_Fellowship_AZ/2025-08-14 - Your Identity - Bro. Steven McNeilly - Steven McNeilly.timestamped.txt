[5:30] You change my life in so many ways.

[5:52] Oh, there's one thing I know for sure.
[5:59] Fresh as the morning new, you make your
[6:04] mercy new
[6:09] every morning. Sing the first verse.
[6:15] And I
[6:18] thought that I had crossed the line.
[6:24] walked away from love one time.
[6:32] Too many.
[6:38] And I
[6:41] thought I'd used up all the grace
[6:46] set aside for my mistakes.
[6:51] [Music]
[6:54] So many.
[6:55] [Music]
[6:59] But on my knees

[8:10] his mercies are new and fresh every
[8:12] morning. Amen. And how many would have a
[8:14] need this this evening as we come into
[8:16] his presence. When we're his presence,
[8:19] anything is possible. Amen. We serve a
[8:22] God that's more than able. All you have
[8:24] to do is reach out and touch him. Let
[8:26] him touch you tonight. Amen. Let's sing
[8:28] that chorus. He touched me. Oh, he
[8:30] touched me. Oh, the joy that floods my
[8:32] soul.
[8:36] He touched me.
[8:39] Oh,
[8:42] he touched me.
[8:46] And oh,
[8:48] the joy that floods my soul.
[8:56] Something
[8:58] happened.
[9:00] And now
[9:02] I know
[9:04] he touched me and made me. Sing the
[9:10] chorus one more time.
[9:13] Oh, he touched me.
[9:16] Yes,
[9:18] he touched me.
[9:22] And oh,
[9:25] the joy that floods my soul.
[9:32] Something wonderful happened.
[9:36] And now
[9:37] I know
[9:40] he touched me and made
[9:44] me whole.
[9:48] Praise the Lord. Several prayer requests
[9:50] tonight. Brother Roger Shar, would you
[9:52] come tonight? Brother Roger, take us to
[9:53] the Lord in prayer. Sister Tempe says,
[9:56] "We have an unspoken prayer request for
[9:57] our daughter Caitlyn." So, let's
[9:59] remember sister Caitlyn and Lord knows
[10:00] what her need is. Brother Amos had
[10:03] shoulder surgery today. Brother Steven
[10:05] heard from him just before we came out.
[10:08] Surgery went well. He's going to be in
[10:09] the hospital for the night. And just ask
[10:11] for a speedy recovery for Brother Amos.
[10:13] Pray the Lord just be with him. And
[10:15] let's remember, Brother Russell goes in
[10:16] for surgery on Friday. And we just pray
[10:19] the Lord be with Brother Russell. Amen.
[10:23] Sister Karen has turned in a note. She
[10:25] says, "Sister Sarah's asking prayer for
[10:28] her co-worker's dad. His name is Jose.
[10:31] He has prostate cancer, stage 4, and
[10:34] they're praying for God to intervene
[10:36] with a healing in his life, prolong his
[10:38] days." So, the Lord is more than able
[10:40] tonight. So, let's remember this
[10:42] gentleman named Jose. And whatever your
[10:44] need might be this evening, just lift
[10:45] before the Lord as Brother Roger come
[10:47] and pray for us.
[10:55] Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we just
[10:58] thank you, Lord, for another privilege
[11:00] and opportunity to be gathered together
[11:02] tonight in your name. Lord, we just ask
[11:04] that for your presence to come down,
[11:06] Lord, and touch every heart, Father.
[11:08] Touch every everyone, Lord, that has a
[11:11] need. And we all have needs, Lord Jesus.
[11:14] and the prayer requests I hold in my
[11:16] hand, Lord. You knew them before the
[11:18] foundation of the world, Lord Jesus. And
[11:21] we know for assurityity that you hear
[11:23] our prayers, Lord. So, we're asking you
[11:24] that you'd minister to every one of
[11:26] these needs, Lord Jesus. Touch each one,
[11:29] Lord. I pray. Thank you, Lord, for being
[11:31] with Brother Amos through his surgery
[11:34] this this afternoon or whenever it was,
[11:37] Lord. And we thank you for ministering
[11:39] to his need, Lord. May he have a speedy
[11:42] recovery, full recovery. Lord Jesus, in
[11:44] your name we pray.
[11:46] Thank you, Lord, for this service, Lord.
[11:48] May you have the preeminence. May you
[11:51] minister to all our needs tonight, Lord.
[11:53] And and may you have your way in every
[11:56] heart tonight. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[11:58] name. Amen.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Roger. You may
[12:02] be seated tonight. I want to welcome
[12:04] each one in the house of the Lord. For
[12:06] those of you streaming tonight, just a
[12:08] reminder, Sunday school starts up Sunday
[12:10] right after Labor Day be the 7th of
[12:12] September. And if you haven't yet
[12:14] completed one of the information forms
[12:16] for your children, please do that so we
[12:18] have some general information on who's
[12:20] in the classes. And if you could turn
[12:21] that into the deacons, be greatly
[12:23] appreciated. Amen. How many are happy
[12:26] tonight?
[12:27] &gt;&gt; Woke up this morning feeling fine.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Had heaven on my mind all day and the
[12:31] more I look around, the more I want to
[12:33] go there.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that tonight. I woke up
[12:37] this morning feeling fine.
[12:40] Oh, I woke up with heaven on my mind.
[12:46] I woke up with joy in my soul.
[12:50] For I knew that the Lord had control.
[12:56] I knew I was walking in the light.
[13:00] for I'd been on my knees in the night.
[13:05] I prayed till the Lord gave me sight.
[13:10] And now I'm feeling mighty fine.
[13:14] Oh yes, I'm feeling
[13:17] mighty fine.
[13:19] Oh, I've got heaven
[13:22] on my mind. You know, don't you know?
[13:27] I want to go
[13:30] to where the milk and honey flows. And
[13:34] there's a light
[13:36] that always shines
[13:39] down inside
[13:41] this heart of mine.
[13:44] Oh, I've got heaven, heaven, heaven,
[13:47] heaven on my mind. And now I'm feeling
[13:51] mighty fine.
[13:54] We're walking with Jesus all the time.
[13:59] We're walking and talking as we climb.
[14:04] We're traveling that road to the sky
[14:08] where I know I'll live if I die.
[14:13] And he's been telling me all about this
[14:16] land.
[14:18] And he tells me that everything is
[14:21] grand.
[14:22] And he says that a home will be mine.
[14:28] And now I'm feeling mighty fine.
[14:32] Oh yes, I'm feeling
[14:34] mighty fine.
[14:37] Oh, I've got heaven
[14:39] on my mind.

[14:44] I want to go
[14:47] to where
[14:48] the milk and honey blows. There's a
[14:52] light
[14:53] that always shines
[14:56] down inside
[14:58] this heart of mine.

[15:04] my mind. And now I'm feeling mighty once
[15:09] again. Oh yes, I'm feeling

[15:36] this heart of mine.
[15:38] I've got heaven, heaven, heaven on my
[15:43] mind. And now I'm feeling mighty fine.
[15:48] Hallelujah.
[15:50] The voice of my beloved, behold, he
[15:53] quickly comes, sweeping over the
[15:56] mountains, over the hills he runs.
[16:00] I long to hear his voice. I long to hear
[16:04] it say, "Arise, my love, my fair one,
[16:08] come away."
[16:10] Oh, it's manifesting time. The fruits
[16:14] are on the vine and the lovely one is

[27:53] hearts bowed, I would like to uh read a
[27:56] a late prayer request that came in. It
[27:58] says, "Please pray for my wife Miriam.
[28:02] Two months ago, she suffered a rare
[28:04] condition called a molar pregnancy.
[28:06] Doctors told us if the tumor grew back,
[28:09] they had a concern for cancer. Some
[28:11] tests indicated it's regrown or she has
[28:15] conceived. We are asking the prayers of
[28:17] the saints for the Lord be with her and
[28:20] touch her completely and give her peace
[28:22] during this time. Thank you, brother
[28:25] Corey Cook, let's just bow our heads
[28:28] together. Father God,
[28:31] &gt;&gt; your name is life.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; Your name is power.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Your name Lord
[28:38] &gt;&gt; is the name above all names. And so,
[28:41] Father, we come to thee in thy precious
[28:43] name this evening, knowing, Lord, that
[28:46] all things are in thy hands. And we
[28:48] bring before you, our sister here,
[28:51] Miriam, Lord, and this pregnancy uh uh
[28:54] no doubt, Lord. It's it's kind of
[28:56] strange and they're in a a limbo of
[28:59] state and mind, not knowing what it is,
[29:02] Father. But you know, Lord, and so
[29:04] Father, I ask for a touch, Father, that
[29:07] you would touch her from the crown of
[29:08] her head to the soles of her feet. We
[29:11] pray that it is a conception and not a
[29:13] tumorous cancer, Lord. Father, we place
[29:16] the family in your hands, Lord. And let
[29:19] thy kingdom uh thy kingdom, Lord, and
[29:22] let thy glory be done in their lives,
[29:24] Father God. We present them to you now.
[29:27] And we ask that you would be with us
[29:29] this evening. Father, as we come and we
[29:32] are at this portion of this service,
[29:34] Father, you know what you've placed on
[29:37] my heart and you know the needs that's
[29:39] upon your people's hearts, Father. And I
[29:42] believe that both are connected, Lord,
[29:44] because you don't put a thought without
[29:46] a need, Lord. And so, Father, I pray
[29:48] this evening that your word would not
[29:50] return void, but it will accomplish,
[29:52] Lord, what it's designed to do. We'll
[29:55] give you all the praise and all the
[29:56] honor and all the glory for it only
[29:58] belongs unto thee. In the name of Jesus
[30:01] Christ, we ask these favors. Amen. And
[30:04] amen. Well, thank you musicians. God
[30:07] bless you. God bless you this evening.
[30:09] It's good to be in the house of the
[30:11] Lord. And we welcome each and every one
[30:13] of you here into his presence. If you
[30:16] have your Bible, turn with me to the
[30:18] book of Luke, chapter 15, and uh we'll
[30:23] read verses 11 through 32.
[30:27] A very familiar portion of scripture for
[30:30] us
[30:33] because that was us at one time,
[30:36] &gt;&gt; the prodal son.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[30:45] Luke chapter 15, we'll start at verse
[30:47] 11. And it reads, "And he said, a
[30:50] certain man had two sons. And the
[30:53] younger of them said to his father,
[30:56] father, give me the portion of goods
[30:59] that followleth me." And he divided unto
[31:03] them his living. And not many days after
[31:07] the younger son gathered all together
[31:09] and took his journey into a far country
[31:12] and there wasted his substance with
[31:14] riotist living. And when he had spent
[31:17] all, there arose a mighty famine in the
[31:19] land, and he began to be in want. And he
[31:22] went and joined himself to a citizen of
[31:24] that country. And he sent him into his
[31:27] fields to feed swine. And he would fain
[31:30] have filled his belly with the husks
[31:32] that the swine did eat. and no man give
[31:35] unto him. And when he had came to
[31:39] himself, he said, "How many hired
[31:41] servants of my father's um have bread
[31:45] enough and to spare, and I perish with
[31:48] hunger? I will arise and go to my
[31:51] father, and will say unto him, Father, I
[31:53] have sinned against heaven and before
[31:56] thee, and I'm no more worthy to be
[31:58] called thy son. Make me as one of thy
[32:01] hired servants." You see, he he came to
[32:04] a place where God could really deal with
[32:06] his heart.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Uh and he arose and came to his father.
[32:12] But when he was yet a great way off, his
[32:15] father saw him and had compassion and
[32:18] ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.
[32:20] And the son said unto him, "Father, I've
[32:22] sinned against heaven and in thy sight,
[32:25] and uh I'm no more worthy to be called
[32:27] thy son." But the father said to his
[32:30] servants, "Bring forth the best robe.
[32:32] Put it on him. Put a ring on his hand
[32:35] and shoes on his feet, and bring hither
[32:37] the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us
[32:40] eat and be merry. For this my son was
[32:43] dead, and is alive again. He was lost
[32:46] and is found, and they began to be
[32:48] merry." Now his older son was in the
[32:51] field. And as he came and drew nigh to
[32:54] the house, he heard music and dancing.
[32:56] And he called one of the servants and
[32:58] asked what these things meant. And they
[33:01] said unto him, "Thy brother is come, and
[33:04] thy father hath killed the fatted calf,
[33:06] because he hath received him safe and
[33:08] sound." Wow. He should have been really
[33:10] thankful for his brother coming back
[33:12] into the house of the Lord. But he was
[33:14] angry, and he would not go in.
[33:17] Therefore, his father came out and
[33:19] entreated him. And he answering said to
[33:22] his father, "Lo, these many years do I
[33:25] serve thee, neither transgressed I at
[33:28] any time thy commandment, and yet thou
[33:30] never gavest me a kid, that I might make
[33:33] Mary with my friends." But as soon as
[33:35] this thy son was come, which hath
[33:38] devoured thy living with harlots, thou
[33:40] hast killed for him the fatted calf."
[33:43] And he said unto him, "Son, thou art
[33:46] ever with me, and all that I have is
[33:48] thine." It was meat that we should make
[33:50] merry and be glad. For this thy brother,
[33:53] he was dead
[33:55] &gt;&gt; and is alive again and was lost
[33:58] &gt;&gt; and is found.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may take your seat this
[34:01] evening.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; I would like to title my sermon this
[34:08] evening your identity.
[34:12] And we see here with um with this prodal
[34:17] um before he became a prodal and
[34:19] returned to his father, he knew exactly
[34:22] who he was. He had an identity. And the
[34:27] reason that we know that he knew who he
[34:30] was and he understood his identity is
[34:33] because he had an understanding of his
[34:35] inheritance that belonged unto him.
[34:36] Right.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; And so with identity, there comes a
[34:40] revelation of inheritance.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; And so that's why, you know, even on
[34:45] Sunday's service, I thought it was quite
[34:48] fascinating to to watch uh the the
[34:51] sermon unfold the way it did. And and
[34:54] these five these five women, they they
[34:56] they approached Moses and they
[34:58] approached God. And and the reason that
[35:00] they were approaching is because there
[35:02] was an inheritance that belonged unto
[35:05] them that was from their father.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; And so the reason that they knew there
[35:09] was an an inheritance was because they
[35:12] had an identity.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Not only did they know who they were,
[35:17] but they knew who their father was. They
[35:20] knew the reputation that their father
[35:22] had. They knew the belongings and the
[35:24] and and the fields and and whatever it
[35:27] may have been that belonged to her to
[35:29] their fathers. And therefore they said,
[35:31] "Let it not perish or or go to someone
[35:34] else, but let it go to us because we we
[35:37] are still bone of his bone and we are
[35:39] flesh of his flesh." And therefore what
[35:42] is his, it should be ours also. And so
[35:45] when they came and they asked before
[35:47] before Moses and said uh give unto us
[35:50] our inheritance, they were not asking a
[35:52] miss.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Let me say that when the bride of Jesus
[35:56] Christ catches her identity, when she
[35:59] asks something of her father, she is not
[36:02] asking a miss. When you're asking your
[36:04] father of something of your inheritance
[36:07] that you need in your life, you're not
[36:09] asking a miss. Why? Because you know
[36:12] what is his is also yours. His
[36:14] inheritance is your inheritance.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; So here he was, he had an identity. He
[36:20] never had an identity crisis, but he
[36:23] knew who he was. He knew what belonged
[36:25] to him.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; But yet he had his eyes on the wrong
[36:30] things. Amen. Right.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; And so later on in the service, I'll
[36:34] I'll read a few portions out of uh
[36:37] spiritual amnesia because we see that
[36:40] that uh that sons and daughters of God,
[36:43] they can get amnesia in their lives and
[36:46] they can forget who they are.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; They might at one time in their life
[36:52] have a revelation of being sons and
[36:54] daughters of God, of of recognizing an
[36:57] inheritance that belongs to them. But
[36:59] when we get our eyes off of the main
[37:01] thing, we can become blinded to the word
[37:04] by the world.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; There's only one letter of difference.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; We should be blinded to the world by the
[37:14] word.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; But so much of the time we become
[37:17] blinded to the word by the world.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; I say, Father, keep our eyes on things
[37:24] above. Keep our eyes on our inheritance.
[37:28] keep our eyes upon the word and not the
[37:31] world.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; In 1964, brother Brandham says in the
[37:36] sermon identification, if you notice, if
[37:39] you go to a certain denominational
[37:40] church like a Methodist, Presbyterian,
[37:43] Lutheran, or something, you have to have
[37:45] something to identify yourself. If
[37:47] you're going to speak, you have to have
[37:49] a credential or a card or a fellowship
[37:51] card or something to identify yourself
[37:54] as where they know where you come from
[37:56] and what you're going to say at that
[37:58] platform. You have to be identified and
[38:01] it's an identifying age.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Notice that whenever brother Brandon was
[38:06] first speaking this back in 1964, he
[38:10] says this is an identifying age.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; No doubt. I'm sure perhaps he looked
[38:18] into the future of Leodysia and he saw
[38:21] that towards the end of the age here we
[38:24] would be living in such a time where
[38:26] people would have a problem with
[38:28] identifications.
[38:30] They would have an issue of identity,
[38:32] not knowing who they are, not knowing
[38:34] who their parents are, not knowing the
[38:37] inheritance that is left to them, not
[38:39] knowing if they're a boy or a girl
[38:42] &gt;&gt; or a cat or a mouse
[38:44] &gt;&gt; or a dog.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; It's an identifying age.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; People not understanding their true
[38:54] identity.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:56] not understanding what they are if
[38:58] they're some kind of animal or if
[39:02] they're a human being. What would make
[39:04] somebody begin to um let me say the word
[39:07] dab or dabble would be the right word to
[39:11] dabble in such things as as as as a cat
[39:14] and a mouse and and a and a change of
[39:17] sex and all these things that for us it
[39:19] just absolutely blows our mind. What
[39:22] would make them dabble in that and and
[39:23] and and and and try to see if that's who
[39:26] they really are?
[39:28] &gt;&gt; It's because they don't know who they
[39:29] are.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; They have no identity in who they are.
[39:33] And so they're trying to become
[39:35] something else to try and find something
[39:38] that they can relate to.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that our
[39:45] identity only comes from Christ.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; It only comes from God and God's word.
[39:50] And so our identity actually comes from
[39:54] the male.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; It does not come from the female.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Let me finish the rest of this this uh
[40:03] this quote here. Now all that happens in
[40:06] the natural. Now brother Brandham is
[40:08] talking about the natural and he's going
[40:10] to type it to the spiritual is only a
[40:12] type what's going on in the spiritual.
[40:15] We also the Christian church itself
[40:17] which is of no denomination but of a
[40:19] nature. It is the mystical body of
[40:22] Christ. Notice it's by nature and not by
[40:26] name.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; So much of the time we get caught up by
[40:30] name by the name of the church by the
[40:33] name of the denomination. Understand the
[40:35] denomination is the woman.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; And so it's not the name but it's the
[40:41] nature.
[40:45] It is the mystical body of Christ and
[40:47] it's identified also. It bears
[40:50] identification. Jesus identified
[40:52] himself. And now we're going to speak
[40:54] the this afternoon upon identification
[40:57] in the Bible character. We are uh to
[41:00] identify our present condition and with
[41:03] characters of the Bible of other ages.
[41:07] So in other words, we need to identify
[41:10] ourselves within the scriptures. And in
[41:12] order to identify yourself within the
[41:14] scripture, you got to read the
[41:16] scriptures.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; You got to be a Bible believer. You got
[41:19] to be a Bible reader to understand to
[41:22] see yourself within the scriptures. So,
[41:25] let me let me provoke you to good works
[41:27] this evening. Get into your Bible. Read
[41:29] your Bible. Spend a little bit of time
[41:32] in your Bible reading it to see which
[41:34] characters within this word that you can
[41:37] relate to and identify yourself with. So
[41:40] much of the time we can identify with
[41:42] with with Ruth or we identify with uh
[41:45] the story of Boaz and Esther and and the
[41:48] more you read your Bibles, the more that
[41:51] you begin to identify yourself with
[41:54] certain characters within the word.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; But let me say this, it is not enough
[42:00] just to identify yourself with, let me
[42:04] just say, with with with the the lion
[42:06] anointing.
[42:08] The lion anointing is good and we are
[42:11] identified with it, but we can't stop
[42:13] there.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; It's good to be identified with the ox
[42:16] and the the uh and carrying other
[42:19] people's burdens and and it's a burden
[42:21] carrier and a burden bearer and it's
[42:24] good to carry each other's burdens, but
[42:25] we can't stop there.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; It's good to have the the intellects of
[42:30] a man anointing within our lives. It's
[42:32] it's good to identify with that, but we
[42:34] can't stop there. The bride of Christ
[42:36] continues on to this last anointing upon
[42:39] this age, which is the eagle anointing.
[42:42] If you don't get caught up with the
[42:44] eagle anointing, you'll be stuck in the
[42:46] man anointing. And if you're stuck in
[42:48] the man anointing, you'll see the man
[42:50] and not the lamb.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the eagle anointing takes
[42:55] us up higher.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5, he says, "Come on
[43:00] up here, John.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you these things. I'm
[43:03] going to reveal myself to you of this
[43:05] great plan of redemption. And John found
[43:08] himself as a type of the bride under the
[43:10] eagle anointing caught up into the
[43:12] heavens.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; And what was it that caught him up to
[43:16] the heavens? It was the anointing.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; And what was it that was in the heavens?
[43:21] There was a lamb
[43:23] &gt;&gt; that had been slain since before the
[43:25] foundations of the world.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; So what does the anointing of this hour
[43:30] do? The anointing of this hour takes us
[43:33] off of man-made creeds and ideas and it
[43:36] brings us up a little bit higher into
[43:40] the presence of the lamb and not the
[43:42] man.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; So when you miss the eagle anointing,
[43:46] when you miss the revealing of the word
[43:48] for the day and hour in which we're
[43:50] living in, you're under the anointing of
[43:52] a man and not the lamb or the eagle.
[43:58] What is so good about that, brother
[44:00] Stephen? You ever wonder about an eagle?
[44:03] An eagle uses the wind to his advantage.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Whereas a lion doesn't like wind.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; You ever see animals? You ever try to go
[44:12] hunt deer in the wind?
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Good luck.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; They're hidden. They're hiding. Why?
[44:20] They don't like the wind. Yeah.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Do any of you like going out and walking
[44:24] in the wind
[44:25] &gt;&gt; when it's super windy up in Flagstaff on
[44:28] top of the mountain? Said, "Nobody."
[44:31] &gt;&gt; Chapped lips galore, man.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; None of us like the wind. But the eagle
[44:37] takes the same wind that the man
[44:39] anointing looks at and and and the ox
[44:42] and the lion and and these earthbound
[44:44] anointings. And the line the the eagle
[44:46] takes the same wind that affects these
[44:48] earthbound creatures and it uses it to
[44:51] its advantage.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; And so now our whenever we look at the
[44:55] the uh the winds of life and the trials
[44:58] and tribulations and the things that
[45:00] that that bombard us on a on a daily
[45:03] basis, can you say amen?
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Have you have you got trials and
[45:06] temptations and issues and things that
[45:08] you face? Sure you do. But now under
[45:11] this eagle anointing, we can say that
[45:13] all things work together for good.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; We can say, "I may not like or enjoy
[45:18] this, but I'm going to use it for my
[45:21] benefit because I know that God is doing
[45:23] it for my good."
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen, sir.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; We've got to identify ourselves
[45:31] &gt;&gt; with the word of the hour.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; And by identifying ourselves with the
[45:36] word, it is made flesh and made
[45:38] manifested.
[45:40] There's a quote where cuz I believe that
[45:42] whatever you identify with your life is
[45:46] going to prove it.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; True.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; And you can only identify with what's in
[45:51] your heart.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; So sometimes we need a change of heart.
[45:56] Amen.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham says uh
[46:01] in the sermon spiritual amnesia, we are
[46:04] identified with our families in this
[46:06] human life by marriage and with our
[46:08] wives. We marry and our families
[46:11] identified by the union of our marriage.
[46:16] So now, brother Brham is taking the
[46:18] natural and he's saying that we as human
[46:22] beings that are that are living our
[46:24] lives, we are identified as humans by
[46:28] who we marry, the family that we have,
[46:31] and the family that we produce. We are
[46:34] identified by our union and by our
[46:36] marriage. Not only are we identified by
[46:40] our union and marriage and and our
[46:42] children and so on and our and our
[46:44] parents and everything but we are
[46:46] identified uh we have an identification
[46:49] according to where we grew up.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; We have an identification according to
[46:56] the part of the world that we grew up
[46:58] in.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. the part of the country in that
[47:02] that say it was in the north of a
[47:04] certain country that is part of your
[47:07] identity.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; It is a part of who you are. It is a
[47:11] part of what makes you as a human.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; It makes up your nature because it makes
[47:18] your nature is your identity. Amen.
[47:24] So according to the place where we were
[47:26] raised, the families that we were raised
[47:29] under, how our grandpa was, how our
[47:31] great grandpa was and on down the line,
[47:34] we understand that according to our
[47:36] union and the people that are
[47:38] surrounding us in our lives, no matter
[47:40] where it is upon the world, it is part
[47:43] of our uh makeup, our nature and our
[47:48] identity and what makes us us. Amen.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Take somebody from the south for
[47:54] instance, uh um from wherever, a country
[47:59] person.
[48:01] Go talk to him for a while.
[48:04] Well,
[48:06] let me tell you something.
[48:09] It sure is a nice day today. And us in
[48:13] the city, we're like, "Yeah, it is. It's
[48:14] a wonderful day." Come on. Let's speed
[48:16] the story up a little bit.
[48:19] What is it that can make two people from
[48:21] the same country completely different?
[48:23] &gt;&gt; It's according to where they're raised.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; When I was in Australia, it was pretty
[48:30] awesome. Those people there are so
[48:32] relaxed, man. So laid-back. And I
[48:35] thought, "Wow, this is pretty amazing."
[48:37] So when I go to other camps and minister
[48:39] at other camps, I'm checking to see uh
[48:42] how they run it and and and and all that
[48:44] because I'm comparing apples to apples,
[48:47] you know, and um and so I'm over there
[48:50] and I'm thinking, "Wow, these people are
[48:52] sure are laid-back like us, you know,
[48:55] service starts at 7. Song service starts
[48:59] at this time. People, you better be here
[49:00] at this time and you better be seated
[49:02] and this and that." And we're so
[49:03] uptight. Let's just be real. We're so
[49:07] uptight that everything must run
[49:08] according to the time. And if it
[49:10] doesn't, it's the end of the world.
[49:12] That's just how we are. And and I'll say
[49:15] this,
[49:16] you can you can take this out of the the
[49:18] streaming, okay? I think we run a really
[49:22] good camp. Like everything runs very
[49:25] very very well. Okay. The organization
[49:28] part of it, it really does. So, we're
[49:30] over there and uh the my first first
[49:33] night I was going to preach and and
[49:35] brother Daniel, he texts me. He says
[49:37] they call each other bro. Hey, bro. He
[49:39] text me. He says, "Hey, bro. We're 30
[49:41] minutes late." Okay, great. So, I got an
[49:44] extra 30 minutes late. Hey, bro. 45
[49:46] minutes. And all of a sudden, and so I'm
[49:49] like, "Well, might as well just go up
[49:51] there and sit and see what's going on."
[49:53] And uh and so I go up there and I start
[49:56] talking to people like, "Hey, what's
[49:57] going on here? Like, why aren't why
[49:59] aren't you ready?" And and why is this?
[50:00] He goes, "Hey, bro. We got nowhere else
[50:04] to go.
[50:06] What are you so uptight about?"
[50:09] I said, "Okay, that's fair."
[50:12] And they just roll with it. And they're
[50:14] so laidback. And and so after everything
[50:16] was over and they're driving me to the
[50:18] airport, I said, "You know what, Brother
[50:20] Daniel?
[50:22] You guys are so laidback, man. This is
[50:24] great. I'm going to take the Australian
[50:27] spirit back to the US with me. I'm just
[50:29] gonna relax and and and just chill out,
[50:32] man. So, we're driving on the freeway
[50:35] and uh this is I just got done saying
[50:38] this. Just got done. And all of a
[50:40] sudden, there's two cars in front of us
[50:42] in this low lane and we're doing 65
[50:45] kilometers, which is like 45 miles per
[50:47] hour. I'm What are they doing, man? I
[50:51] said, "Brother Daniel, aren't you going
[50:53] to pass these folks like 45 miles per
[50:56] hour in the freeway?" He says, "Brother
[50:58] Steve, I thought you were going to relax
[50:59] and take the spirit of Australia back
[51:02] with you." I said, "I'm already home in
[51:04] my mind. I'm sorry, man.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; We're all humans.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; But yet, according to where we were
[51:11] brought up, according to our family and
[51:13] our culture and everything of it, it
[51:15] makes us all different.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we have different natures and
[51:21] therefore we identify with things
[51:24] differently."
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:28] So our identities
[51:31] it is it is made up of all those
[51:33] different things but our true identity
[51:37] as as as as humans not even in the
[51:42] spiritual realm yet it comes from the
[51:44] father
[51:46] and I can use scripturally because in
[51:49] our in our opening scripture there when
[51:51] the prodal came back mom didn't run out
[51:53] to see him mom didn't run out and say,
[51:56] "Hey, give him the robe. Give him the
[51:58] ring. Give him this. Kill the fatted
[52:00] calf. Do this, that, and the other."
[52:01] Everybody, "Hey, my son is home. Praise
[52:04] the Lord." No, it was the dad.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Whenever it came time for adoption, it
[52:09] wasn't mom who adopted the kids. It was
[52:12] dad.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; And so it is with us within this life
[52:17] that we live. Mom doesn't bring us to
[52:20] adoption, but dad does.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's only certain ways and
[52:25] certain places that dad can take us to
[52:28] as we're growing up what mom can't take
[52:30] care of.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; And so what happens is is that we people
[52:38] that are um that have an absentee
[52:42] father,
[52:44] they they have no identity in the
[52:47] natural.
[52:48] So that's why you can look at you can
[52:51] look at the news and you can look at
[52:52] life and everything that's going on this
[52:54] past five, six years, whatever it is,
[52:57] and you see the people trying to be
[52:59] transgenders and this one trying to be
[53:01] this and this one trying to be that and
[53:03] and foxes and cats and so on and so
[53:05] forth. And you wonder to yourself, what
[53:07] is going on? What is happening? Why are
[53:09] they doing it? It's because we have a
[53:11] fatherless society.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; And only dad can give us our true
[53:16] identity. And if dad is not home, if dad
[53:19] is not present, if dad is absent, we
[53:22] have no identity and we look for it in
[53:25] other places.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; So that's why a young man can be can be
[53:30] raised up in a home and all of a sudden
[53:32] dad is not there and little little Jimmy
[53:34] ends up in a gang.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Why does Jimmy end up in a gang? Because
[53:38] dad isn't around.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; He needs to get his identity from
[53:42] somewhere. And so he goes out and he
[53:44] gets it from other places.
[53:47] Why does why does Sally go out and and
[53:50] and and and give her body to whoever
[53:53] whoever desires it? It's because of the
[53:56] need of attention that she's not getting
[53:58] from dad at home cuz she's trying to
[54:01] find her identity in another male
[54:04] instead of her dad. Right.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; And so we can see there's there's a real
[54:12] problem with
[54:14] &gt;&gt; not only identity, identity uh people
[54:18] not understanding their identity is is a
[54:21] byproduct
[54:23] of a fatherless society.
[54:27] It is a byproduct of dad not being home,
[54:31] of dad not being around, and of dad not
[54:35] taking care of business like he should
[54:37] be.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Let me let me read this to you. This is
[54:42] pretty fascinating because I I I looked
[54:46] up about a a fatherless society in the
[54:49] statistics and and different things. And
[54:52] this is very enlightening. And you're
[54:54] going to say, "Well, you're just talking
[54:55] about the uh a one family home." I'm
[54:59] not. Because there's many times that dad
[55:03] is at home and there's a union between
[55:06] mom and dad and there's a family, but
[55:08] dad is absent
[55:10] &gt;&gt; even when he's present.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:13] And so I feel like it's not not only has
[55:17] it Satan doesn't care about it in the
[55:19] world, but he wants it to creep in
[55:21] &gt;&gt; to the church.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; And he wants it to creep in to our to
[55:25] our lives and to our homes that just as
[55:28] he doesn't care if mom and dad are there
[55:30] as long as he can get dad to be absent.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; He knows that the identity crisis will
[55:37] continue even when dad is there.
[55:42] And here's the thing about it, saints.
[55:45] We've all been absent.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; As fathers.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; We've all been there, but we're not
[55:51] there.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; We've all been there, but somewhere else
[55:54] in our mind. And and and and and I'm
[55:57] wanting to provoke you onto good works
[56:00] and to recognize it and to realize it
[56:04] and to pay attention like the like the
[56:06] prodical son. He came to himself. I
[56:09] agree.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; We need our our our husbands and our
[56:12] fathers at home
[56:14] &gt;&gt; to come to ourselves
[56:16] &gt;&gt; and to realize I'm present but I'm
[56:18] absent.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; I'm both at the same time. The lights
[56:22] are on but no one is home.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; And when no one is home, mom is the one
[56:26] that's taking care of business. And when
[56:28] mom is taking care of everything, she's
[56:30] out of her place.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Because now mom has to do the job of dad
[56:36] because dad is absent.
[56:38] Amen.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Let's read this.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's not it.
[56:49] I won't read it all, but I'll read some
[56:51] of it. 63% of youth of youth suicides
[56:55] are from fatherless homes.
[56:57] 90% of all homeless and runaway children
[57:00] 90% of homeless and runaway children are
[57:03] from fatherless homes. 85% of all
[57:07] children who show behavior disorders
[57:09] come from fatherless homes. 80% of
[57:12] rapists with anger problems come from
[57:14] fatherless homes. 71% of all high school
[57:17] dropouts come from fatherless homes.
[57:21] Children with fathers who are involved
[57:23] are 40% less likely to repeat a grade in
[57:26] school. Children with fathers are invol
[57:30] childrens with fathers who are involved
[57:32] are 70% less likely to drop out of
[57:35] school. Children with fathers who are
[57:37] involved are more likely to get A's in
[57:40] school. So much of the time you can look
[57:43] at your kids and say, "What's wrong with
[57:45] your grades?" I'll tell you what's wrong
[57:47] with my grades.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; You're not present.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Hope not.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; What was that statistic? children with
[57:55] fathers. There was no percentage on it.
[57:57] But we can look and we can blame the
[57:59] child and we can blame the young adult
[58:01] and we can blame the one who was in
[58:02] college who's always changing their
[58:04] major and always running around and
[58:06] dropping out over here and trying this
[58:07] and trying that and we can blame and
[58:09] say, "Hey, you need to get your act
[58:10] together." But yet, dad, are you
[58:12] present?
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Dad, are you there?
[58:18] Because children with dads involved in
[58:21] their in their educational curriculum,
[58:24] when they're involved, they are more
[58:26] likely to get A's.
[58:31] We went to the little uh uh meet the
[58:34] teacher deal, you know, when you got a
[58:36] bunch of kids in school, it's like it
[58:38] never ends. And so we went and had
[58:42] Miles's chair is right up front. I'm
[58:44] like, good grief, man. sit up front and
[58:47] sitting on his chair and everything. And
[58:49] uh and and and in school, you know, I
[58:53] disliked school and I still dislike it
[58:56] sitting there for longer than 20
[58:58] minutes. I'm ready to leave. I can't
[59:00] stand it. Super nice teacher. Really
[59:03] liked her, but it's just something about
[59:04] it. So anyways, there's a little slip
[59:07] that you fill out and everything. And um
[59:10] and what are your hopes, you know, for
[59:12] Miles? What is he good at? and all this
[59:15] all these things and and I was trying so
[59:17] hard not to brag, you know, and and so I
[59:21] wrote some things and and it said uh uh
[59:23] what what do you expect out of, you
[59:25] know, your child this year? What would
[59:28] you like them to get? And I wrote get
[59:31] all A's.
[59:33] So what does that mean? That means I got
[59:35] to be present.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; I got to be a part of it.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; I got to be there. I got to be involved
[59:44] because if I'm not, it's not all his
[59:46] fault.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Though he's talented and though he's
[59:50] smart and though, you know, I'm trying
[59:52] not to brag, but he's a good kid.
[59:56] Trying not to brag. I got good kids.
[59:58] They're smart. They take after their
[1:00:00] mommy, not after their daddy.
[1:00:04] But if I want him, if I want, if I want
[1:00:07] the outcome, I've got to help them reach
[1:00:09] the outcome.
[1:00:12] Because if I don't and I expect it,
[1:00:14] guess what? There's something evil in my
[1:00:16] heart.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Because I'm expecting something that I'm
[1:00:20] not providing away with. And God doesn't
[1:00:23] do that. And therefore, we should not do
[1:00:25] that to our children, to our spouses, to
[1:00:28] one another.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; This is fascinating.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:36] Um
[1:00:37] 43% of US children live without their
[1:00:40] father. It's almost half.
[1:00:44] 71% of pregnant teenagers lack a father.
[1:00:48] 63% of youth suicides are from
[1:00:50] fatherless homes.
[1:00:54] 75% of adoles adolescent patients in
[1:00:58] chemical abuse centers come from
[1:01:00] fatherless homes. 85% of youth in prison
[1:01:04] grew up in a fatherless home.
[1:01:08] I think you see the picture.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; It is doom
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; and it is gloom. And why are these
[1:01:16] things happening? Because of all of
[1:01:19] these all of these children that are
[1:01:21] that are going through these things.
[1:01:23] Understand there's no correct headship.
[1:01:27] And without the correct headship from
[1:01:29] dad, there is no identity. Therefore,
[1:01:32] they're going to chase their identity
[1:01:34] from other things and other ways and
[1:01:37] other places that we shouldn't be going
[1:01:40] or go or doing or or hanging out with.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Why? Because of an absent father.
[1:01:51] I wonder how many of us within the
[1:01:54] message as fathers and as husbands,
[1:01:58] we're there. We're at home and we're
[1:02:02] providing for our families and we're
[1:02:03] working hard and and we're doing all
[1:02:06] these things and and and we're doing
[1:02:08] everything else, but yet the kids and
[1:02:10] mom are left to themselves.
[1:02:14] Mom makes the dinner, does the dishes,
[1:02:16] get takes care of the kids, and but
[1:02:18] where's dad?
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Where are we?
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; I put myself in it. Where are we? Where
[1:02:27] am I? Where are you?
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Are you present? Are you a a very
[1:02:32] present help in a time of need?
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Just like your heavenly father. How many
[1:02:37] times do we say that about our heavenly
[1:02:39] father? Oh, he's such a good God and
[1:02:42] he's always there for me and he's a very
[1:02:44] present help in a time of need. But when
[1:02:46] it comes to us being father to our
[1:02:49] children, no matter what the age may be,
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; I wonder are we a very present
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; help?
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; I wonder are we there? Are we present?
[1:03:01] Are we in the moment?
[1:03:04] Or are we doing something else? Are we
[1:03:07] on our phones? Are we doing something in
[1:03:09] our mind? or you know are are we
[1:03:11] whatever it may be I don't want to give
[1:03:13] I don't need to do that you know you
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; you know your life I know my life I know
[1:03:20] at certain times where where you know
[1:03:24] let let me be very
[1:03:26] transparent
[1:03:28] love transparency
[1:03:30] I remember sometimes I'll get home and
[1:03:34] I'll lay on the couch and it just feels
[1:03:36] real good just to lay on the couch
[1:03:38] relax. This is my time. I'm just going
[1:03:41] to relax. And kids are old enough now
[1:03:43] where they can do their thing. And you
[1:03:45] know, and Mariah's so good with the
[1:03:47] little baby and everything. Oh, yeah.
[1:03:50] Everything's golden. And I got a
[1:03:52] flashback of when I was a kid.
[1:03:55] And And this wasn't I got two memories
[1:03:59] actually that I completely forgot about.
[1:04:01] The one went way back when my grandpa
[1:04:03] was still alive. And we would my my my
[1:04:06] grandma lived right across the street
[1:04:08] from us like 100 yards uh right across
[1:04:12] the street. So we would go over there
[1:04:13] every Sunday and she would make some
[1:04:15] good roast beef, Yorkshire pudding,
[1:04:17] gravy, you know, just a real good hearty
[1:04:19] Irish meal. And we would go over there
[1:04:21] and my grandpa was always laying on the
[1:04:23] couch. Always not doing a thing. Just
[1:04:27] laying there watching TV. Everybody else
[1:04:29] is busy doing stuff. I thought, "Wow,
[1:04:33] that was my grandpa.
[1:04:35] on my mom's side. Well, I don't want to
[1:04:37] be like him. I wasn't a very good guy.
[1:04:41] When my grandpa died, very transparent.
[1:04:44] You want to know something? Dirty
[1:04:46] laundry. My mom's side of the family.
[1:04:48] Don't tell anybody, okay?
[1:04:51] Don't tell my mom I preached either.
[1:04:53] She'll watch this. He had a He when he
[1:04:55] died, they found out he had a he had a
[1:04:57] whole another family. He had two
[1:05:00] families at once. As if one wasn't
[1:05:02] enough. Any wonder he was laying on the
[1:05:04] couch.
[1:05:12] Soon I got another thought, another
[1:05:14] memory of my dad. Now it's closer to
[1:05:17] home. My my identity. My dad gives me my
[1:05:21] identity.
[1:05:23] And my dad was such a hard worker.
[1:05:26] Always always worked two jobs and and
[1:05:29] everything. and he come home, drink a
[1:05:32] beer and sit on the couch, fall asleep.
[1:05:36] And I thought, what am I turning into
[1:05:40] now? I'm really hard on myself, right?
[1:05:43] Cuz when I share it to my wife, she's
[1:05:45] like, "No, you do lots of stuff. You're
[1:05:46] good." And I'm like,
[1:05:48] I don't think so.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Like, I'm present, but I'm absent.
[1:05:54] I'm here, but I'm not here.
[1:05:57] It's like I'm I'm here, but I'm of no
[1:06:00] value.
[1:06:02] Do I really want to get my identity from
[1:06:05] the bad parts, the hindered parts of my
[1:06:07] family where I'm doing the exact same
[1:06:10] thing or do I want to change? And I
[1:06:13] believe God is the one that showed that
[1:06:15] to me.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; That showed me what I was doing and
[1:06:19] where I got it from. And so now the ball
[1:06:22] is in my court. Now yours might not be
[1:06:24] laying on the couch.
[1:06:26] But I'm sure there's other attributes in
[1:06:28] your life, of your nature, of your
[1:06:31] upbringing that you would say, "My
[1:06:32] goodness, I reacted just like my dad. I
[1:06:35] I reacted over here just like this
[1:06:37] person, and I'm turning into this. Oh
[1:06:39] my." But now, when you notice it, now we
[1:06:42] have a choice. And this goes for girls
[1:06:44] and boys alike, okay? Goes for men and
[1:06:46] women, young and old. Now, we have a
[1:06:49] choice where we're like, well, do I
[1:06:51] really like this attribute of my family
[1:06:53] member or do I dislike it? Is it a good
[1:06:56] attribute or is it bad? And if we're
[1:06:59] honest with ourselves and we say, well,
[1:07:00] this attribute is really bad. I don't
[1:07:03] want to be like them and their and and
[1:07:06] and the things that I disliked. Now,
[1:07:09] it's up to us to change it.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Now we have a choice because
[1:07:15] why should we walk in the footsteps of
[1:07:18] our forefathers that went before us that
[1:07:20] we don't like where they walked or what
[1:07:22] they did?
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; It's complete insanity.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; So now each and every one of us, we have
[1:07:31] this choice where we're like, I like
[1:07:34] this, but I don't like this. And I see
[1:07:36] certain aspects of my life going in this
[1:07:38] way. I choose today to put a stake in
[1:07:41] the ground that I don't want to go in
[1:07:43] this direction. I'm going to go in this
[1:07:46] other direction. And you go to God
[1:07:48] through prayer and say, "Father, help
[1:07:51] me.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Help me in my life. Help me in the
[1:07:54] direction in which I'm going, the things
[1:07:57] that I'm thinking, my outbursts,
[1:07:59] whatever it is that you deal with in
[1:08:01] your life that has been passed down to
[1:08:03] you from your family. If you don't like
[1:08:06] it, you don't got to stay there." Right.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; And if you don't like it, stop using it
[1:08:12] as an excuse.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Real down home, huh?
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; It's good stuff, isn't it?
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; It hits home, doesn't it?
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; It hits home for me, too.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; And so now we have this struggle within
[1:08:28] ourselves,
[1:08:30] and it's a battle that we must fight.
[1:08:32] And it's a battle that we can win when
[1:08:34] we put God first.
[1:08:38] So we see that our our identity as as
[1:08:44] young people, it comes from our fathers.
[1:08:48] Fathers, it comes from fathers, comes
[1:08:51] from dad. It doesn't come from mom,
[1:08:54] comes from the male. It doesn't come
[1:08:56] from female. It comes from the word. It
[1:09:00] doesn't come from the church.
[1:09:05] It doesn't come from the female.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Our identity is not in a church.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Our identity is not in a pastor or a
[1:09:14] preacher.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; And a pastor or a preacher shouldn't be
[1:09:18] bringing the people onto themselves, but
[1:09:20] pointing to Christ.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Because that's what the woman does.
[1:09:24] There's certain things in her life that
[1:09:26] that that she cannot handle that she
[1:09:28] needs dad to take care of.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Have you ever had your wife tell you,
[1:09:33] "You need to deal with this?"
[1:09:37] Sure you have. All of us have heard it.
[1:09:40] Do you know why mama is saying that?
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Because she is not designed to handle
[1:09:45] it.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; It's just a fact.
[1:09:49] So if she's not designed to handle it as
[1:09:52] the female and it and it's it certain
[1:09:55] thing boils certain things boils down to
[1:09:57] correction.
[1:09:59] There are certain things in our lives as
[1:10:02] as as as parents that that a woman can't
[1:10:05] correct her children as dad does. It's
[1:10:08] completely different.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Now follow me with this thought.
[1:10:14] When mom tries to take the place of dad
[1:10:16] to correct the kids and I'm talking
[1:10:19] through experience also.
[1:10:22] When mom tries to take the place of dad
[1:10:24] to correct the kids because she has to
[1:10:26] do it because dad is absent and not
[1:10:29] present, it hardens the spirit.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Because she's not designed to handle
[1:10:38] that part of it. The correction comes
[1:10:41] from the male. Our correction comes from
[1:10:45] the word. It comes from God. Amen.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; It says, "Those who I love, I rebuke and
[1:10:50] I chasen."
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; God is the one who does the rebuking and
[1:10:54] the chastening. But when mom is always
[1:10:57] doing it, guess what happens? Her spirit
[1:11:00] gets hardened. Now, so let's bring it
[1:11:02] down to a church.
[1:11:05] What happens if there's a church which
[1:11:07] is type of the woman, which is female in
[1:11:11] nature? What happens if she's always
[1:11:14] balling out the church and and and
[1:11:17] always correcting the people and always
[1:11:19] having to give the five-fold ministry
[1:11:21] and there's not a balanced ministry
[1:11:24] coming from behind the pulpit for the
[1:11:26] people, the church becomes hardened,
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; the preacher becomes hardened,
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; the pastor becomes hardened. Why? Why
[1:11:37] does his spirit get so hardened? And
[1:11:39] there's no correction out of love
[1:11:41] because his spirit is hardened because
[1:11:43] he's trying to do the correction and not
[1:11:46] bringing it through the word which is
[1:11:48] the male.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Now that's not to say that mom doesn't
[1:11:54] correct the youngans.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? But when
[1:11:59] it gets out of balance,
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; when it gets out of balance in our home
[1:12:04] lives, when it gets out of balance
[1:12:05] within our church life or whatever
[1:12:08] church it may be, I don't know, but it
[1:12:10] becomes the church then becomes hardened
[1:12:14] and the pastor becomes hardened because
[1:12:16] he's he's out of his place with the
[1:12:19] correction.
[1:12:22] And so that's where
[1:12:25] I have to be very careful even with
[1:12:27] preaching this tonight
[1:12:30] because number one, I'm not the pastor.
[1:12:33] And I was battling back here.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; I'm thinking, man, I could just preach
[1:12:37] God or coincidence or I could just
[1:12:39] change it real quick. I got all these
[1:12:41] different sermons. And I was battling
[1:12:44] because I realized, hey son, you ain't
[1:12:47] the pastor. What are you doing preaching
[1:12:49] a sermon like this? And I realized that
[1:12:53] that the more that Satan was fighting me
[1:12:56] in my mind and in my heart, the more I
[1:12:58] realized I needed to preach it.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; I know.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; But the more that I realized that it has
[1:13:05] to come in love.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; It has to come with the right spirit. So
[1:13:10] it's it's it's just like it's just like
[1:13:12] this. Say we have a family member or any
[1:13:15] of you guys see my kids acting um
[1:13:18] disorderly out here and where what they
[1:13:21] shouldn't be doing and you say, "Hey,
[1:13:22] knock it off. Knock it off." Hey, good.
[1:13:27] Thank you. Tell them to knock it off.
[1:13:29] They shouldn't be doing that. It's
[1:13:31] dangerous. Whatever the whatever it may
[1:13:32] be. But whenever you come to,
[1:13:36] you know, physical correction, well, now
[1:13:39] it's not taken the same way. Why?
[1:13:42] because it's my kids. But knock it off.
[1:13:44] It's fine. So tonight it's just a little
[1:13:46] knock it off. Okay.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; And I'm preaching to myself just as
[1:13:53] much.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Trust me.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Trust me.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But it's but it's
[1:14:00] something that I feel that is is that us
[1:14:04] as fathers and us as husbands and
[1:14:07] whatever it may be, we need to be um
[1:14:10] aware
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; of where we're at. Amen.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; And we need to be aware of when we're
[1:14:15] absent that we might get back in present
[1:14:17] again because we are only helpful when
[1:14:20] we are present.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; We are only helpful when we are in the
[1:14:24] now.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; And if we're there and we're not there,
[1:14:27] we're not helping. And then that's why
[1:14:28] God gave us a family.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; My
[1:14:35] So
[1:14:36] in the sermon, a paradox. This is a
[1:14:38] pretty lengthy quote, so just bear with
[1:14:41] me. But for instance, a few days ago, I
[1:14:44] was called in on a scene or on a little
[1:14:46] something going on. There was a fine a
[1:14:49] fine young man, very fine boy. He was
[1:14:51] going with a little girl, very fine
[1:14:53] little girl out of a fine family. notice
[1:14:56] everything's fine, huh? Fine boys, fine
[1:14:59] girl, fine families. And this boy all of
[1:15:02] a sudden came up with some kind of an
[1:15:03] idea and he just walked away.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; He did something wrong to the little
[1:15:07] girl as much as promised her to do a
[1:15:09] certain thing and then didn't do it. And
[1:15:12] instead of coming to the girl and
[1:15:13] apologizing like a gentleman should do.
[1:15:16] So what do gentlemen do?
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Got it.
[1:15:22] It just wasn't in him to do it. And the
[1:15:26] father and mother called me to the scene
[1:15:28] and said, "We would desire to know what
[1:15:30] is wrong with our boy." Now, it's not
[1:15:32] easy to do sometimes, but you must be
[1:15:34] truthful and honest. The boy was a
[1:15:36] Christian as far as a believer. He had
[1:15:38] repented, had been baptized, and had his
[1:15:40] position among the believers, but yet he
[1:15:43] had not received the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:45] Spirit, no matter how much he thought he
[1:15:47] had. You thinking you had and having it
[1:15:50] is two different things.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; You might be able to try to say you
[1:15:54] have, you might be able to show some
[1:15:56] evidence of some emotion, but unless
[1:15:58] your life is vindicating what you're
[1:15:59] professing to have, you still haven't
[1:16:01] got it. No matter how many emotions, how
[1:16:03] much you jump around sensation, speaking
[1:16:05] in tongues, shouting, or whatever might
[1:16:07] lay it upon, which is all right. I
[1:16:09] believe in all that, too. But unless
[1:16:10] your life copes with your testimony,
[1:16:12] then you haven't got it.
[1:16:15] because the fruit of the spirit
[1:16:16] vindicates what you are just like the
[1:16:18] fruit of any tree tells what it is.
[1:16:19] Jesus said by the fruit you shall know
[1:16:21] them. Now this young fell's parents his
[1:16:23] mother is German. No reflection on the
[1:16:26] German but there's a strain in that
[1:16:29] family. And that is they'll just sit and
[1:16:32] you can talk to them and they'll just
[1:16:35] they'll just stare you right in the
[1:16:37] face. They got it. this girl's sister,
[1:16:40] the mother of this boy. I I have come
[1:16:43] down the street many a morning and this
[1:16:44] young lady be sitting out in the yard
[1:16:46] and I'd say good morning to you and
[1:16:48] she'd just look at me and I'd stop and
[1:16:51] I'd say sure fine morning. She'd just
[1:16:53] stand look at you. An intelligent woman
[1:16:56] and I'd say come up to see us sometime.
[1:16:57] She'd just stand and look. Well, her
[1:16:59] brothers are that way. Father and
[1:17:02] mother's that way. So notice there's a
[1:17:05] strain in the family that the father's
[1:17:08] that way. The mother's that way, the
[1:17:10] kids are that way, and no doubt the
[1:17:12] grandpa was that way, and no doubt you
[1:17:14] could take this strain on down the
[1:17:16] family line.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; To where they were all just really odd
[1:17:20] is how I would put it. Like if I spoke
[1:17:22] to someone and they didn't talk back, I
[1:17:24] would say, "That person is odd." Okay?
[1:17:28] They were odd. There was a strain in
[1:17:30] their family that was passed down
[1:17:31] through generations. A strainness of
[1:17:34] oddness. I think we all have a little
[1:17:36] oddness in us here. you know, one way or
[1:17:39] another that has been passed down to us
[1:17:41] that we just can't get rid of.
[1:17:45] And so here they were and and um father
[1:17:49] and mother's that way. Now, the father
[1:17:51] of the boy is strictly an Irishman. Here
[1:17:53] we go.
[1:17:57] Should I have someone else read it or
[1:17:58] should I read it?
[1:18:01] Moody, high-tempered, highrung. That's
[1:18:05] his whole family like that. except one
[1:18:08] out of the family converted.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; So us converted Irishman, we're not
[1:18:13] moody highrung or anything like that
[1:18:14] anymore. You can just you could just
[1:18:16] relax.
[1:18:20] This father and mother both are
[1:18:22] Christians filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:18:24] and they have brought this young man up
[1:18:26] in the way of the Lord. And now the
[1:18:27] young man is about 17 or 18 years old,
[1:18:29] something along there. Very fine kid.
[1:18:31] And he's been a real a real model at boy
[1:18:33] at home. Nice kid. and he's got a
[1:18:36] brother that's just vice versa. The
[1:18:38] mother's family lives close to a fine
[1:18:40] church, but do you think they'll ever
[1:18:41] come over there? No. They know it's
[1:18:44] right, but it's just not in them to ask
[1:18:46] for forgiveness or ask pardoning, they
[1:18:49] just won't do it. It's just not in them.
[1:18:53] Now, the genes in the father and the
[1:18:54] mother of this boy, no matter how much
[1:18:56] they're converted, notice, no matter how
[1:18:59] much the family of the the parents of
[1:19:02] the children are converted, still
[1:19:05] remains the flesh that's been interbred
[1:19:08] out to this boy. So, it doesn't matter
[1:19:10] how much of the Holy Ghost mom or dad
[1:19:12] does, guess what? The strain is going to
[1:19:15] be passed along the bloodline uh by the
[1:19:18] by the seed of the male and it's going
[1:19:20] to come into the boy. And until he gets
[1:19:22] converted, filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:19:25] himself, he's going to deal with the
[1:19:27] issues and the strain of the family.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; And I'll say this, even with the baptism
[1:19:35] of the Holy Ghost, there will still be a
[1:19:37] fight because it's a part of the
[1:19:39] person's nature. But now if you got the
[1:19:42] nature of God and you got this strain of
[1:19:44] a of a of a family issue in our lives,
[1:19:47] now we can fight against it because
[1:19:49] greater is he
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; that is in you than he who is in the
[1:19:53] world.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; So there's hope.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; He says from his mother's family and
[1:20:01] they're not forgiving, they'll not
[1:20:03] apologize. And that's where the boy
[1:20:05] stands. Now he said to the father, "No
[1:20:07] matter how much you've raised him up,
[1:20:09] now look, look at you out of your
[1:20:12] family, out of them drunks and fighting
[1:20:14] and shooting and cutting and so forth.
[1:20:16] Now look at your family to the mother.
[1:20:18] They're a bunch of people that just sit
[1:20:20] there and won't speak. Very independent
[1:20:22] and so forth. Uh irre irreverent to
[1:20:25] religion. It's not you. You're the only
[1:20:28] one out of your sisters and brothers and
[1:20:30] you're sweet, kind, and forgiving. What
[1:20:34] does it see? You're tree part of that
[1:20:36] family tree. You're a part of that
[1:20:38] family tree. Yet you have received the
[1:20:41] Holy Ghost.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; That's the thing that made you tender
[1:20:46] and sweet. It's not your people anymore.
[1:20:50] I like that.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; It's your Christ that lives in you.
[1:20:55] Amen.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; In order for Christ to live in us, we've
[1:20:59] got to yield our members to Christ that
[1:21:03] he might live through us. But if we
[1:21:06] yield ourselves to our carnal nature,
[1:21:10] that's the one that's going to live his
[1:21:12] life through us.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; I say, "Father, help us."
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; It's not your people anymore. It's your
[1:21:18] Christ in you. I said to the boy, "Look
[1:21:20] at your family. Practically all of them
[1:21:21] drunks and so forth." I said, "And how
[1:21:24] moody and high-tempered and high strong,
[1:21:25] but you're not. You're kind, forgiving."
[1:21:29] What is it? The Holy Spirit. You're no
[1:21:32] more what you are. It's Christ in you.
[1:21:36] Now, that same thing has to happen to
[1:21:38] your son.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; And the father raised up and said, "My
[1:21:41] son went to the altar. He was baptized
[1:21:42] correctly in the name of Jesus Christ in
[1:21:44] water baptism in the pool. I said, I
[1:21:47] know your son has come to Christ. That
[1:21:49] may be all right. all the outward
[1:21:51] emotions. He might be identified as a
[1:21:54] believer with the believers, but until
[1:21:56] he's regenerated, born again, I'd advise
[1:21:59] that young man to never marry a woman.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; He'll make hell on earth for her until
[1:22:04] that gentle, sweet, forgiving spirit of
[1:22:06] Christ comes in.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Then that will be a paradox in itself to
[1:22:10] take the very nature of a boy that's
[1:22:12] bred between father and mother. And yet
[1:22:14] in his intellectuals, he's trying his
[1:22:15] best to overcome it. He can't do it.
[1:22:17] He'll never overcome it. Christ will
[1:22:20] have to overcome it. When he lets Christ
[1:22:22] in and he's already overcome, then it'll
[1:22:25] be a perfect paradox when a man is born
[1:22:27] of the spirit of God.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Talk about a mouthful.
[1:22:37] So here was these not to go over the
[1:22:40] whole thing, but I want to I want you to
[1:22:42] put yourself in the story
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; and I want you to think of where you've
[1:22:47] been raised from
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; from your family traits from mom and
[1:22:51] from dad and and the trait here and and
[1:22:53] and and this was past. People will say,
[1:22:56] "Well, have you ever heard the
[1:22:57] expression you you skipped a generation?
[1:23:00] You're uh uh you're you're not like your
[1:23:02] dad, but you're like your grandfather.
[1:23:05] You ever heard someone say that? They
[1:23:07] say you got traits of so and so down the
[1:23:09] family line. Why is that? Because that
[1:23:13] because that family line, there's a
[1:23:14] family tree that just continues on down.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; And so there's been ways that you and I
[1:23:22] have been raised uh according to where
[1:23:25] we we were raised from and according to
[1:23:28] how our parents were raised and and on
[1:23:30] and on and on. And it all makes up this
[1:23:33] identity of who we think we are. And and
[1:23:36] this is the paradox for me. This part it
[1:23:40] it this is a paradox is like God uses
[1:23:43] some of it and in others of it he wants
[1:23:46] crucified on a daily basis.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; So we can say brother Brandham was a
[1:23:51] fighter. He was an Irishman. He had the
[1:23:52] fighting Irish in his blood. And and
[1:23:54] here he was he he was he was a boxer, a
[1:23:56] professional boxer. And he just had that
[1:23:58] fight in him. He wouldn't quit. And so
[1:24:00] we we've been told time and time again
[1:24:02] that that God converted him, but he
[1:24:04] never took the fight out of him. That
[1:24:05] was part of his nature of where he was
[1:24:07] from as an Irishman. So God took that,
[1:24:09] but he just channeled it in a different
[1:24:11] direction. But there's other parts of
[1:24:13] Brother Brandham's nature that God
[1:24:15] wanted crucified on a daily basis. And
[1:24:18] so God does things with us as well that
[1:24:21] he he he watch brother Brandham said he
[1:24:23] watches our grandfather's
[1:24:24] great-grandfather and this and that and
[1:24:26] it's like a ping-pong ball and it comes
[1:24:27] down and down and down and all of a
[1:24:29] sudden the penny drops and here you
[1:24:30] come. And so God now takes a little bit
[1:24:34] of each and every one of these people
[1:24:36] that makes up who you are as a human
[1:24:39] being. And there's parts of it that he
[1:24:41] wants to use to channel in the right
[1:24:43] direction.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; And then there's other parts of it that
[1:24:47] he wants crucified on a daily basis. Yet
[1:24:49] it's still part of who we are and our
[1:24:52] nature.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; It's an absolute paradox.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; But I want to say this that it's not up
[1:24:59] to us to decide what stays and what
[1:25:01] goes. M good.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; We need to stay under the inspiration of
[1:25:07] the Holy Spirit
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; and say, "Father, reveal to me is this
[1:25:11] good or is this bad?"
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Because if I have good and bad here and
[1:25:15] I draw a line and I write whatever it is
[1:25:18] and I and and I this is good, this is
[1:25:19] bad, this is good, this is bad. Well, I
[1:25:22] don't want to keep the bad. I want to
[1:25:25] get rid of it. And so I say, Father,
[1:25:27] reveal to us and let our spirits be
[1:25:29] tender that when you speak to us about
[1:25:31] something of our inner being and of our
[1:25:34] nature and who we are that you're not
[1:25:36] happy with, I say, "Father, take it.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; I give it to you, Lord.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Help me to overcome it." In this family,
[1:25:44] it was forgiveness and apologizing,
[1:25:47] holding grudges. In your family, it
[1:25:50] might be something different. I don't
[1:25:51] know. Something different in my family.
[1:25:54] But we've all got we've all got these
[1:25:56] things that these strains.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; That hover over us that aren't supposed
[1:26:02] to just stay. They're supposed to go.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; We're to use spiritual discernment on
[1:26:09] our own selves. Not just on other people
[1:26:12] and situations, but on our own selves.
[1:26:15] Spiritual discernment to recognize when
[1:26:18] something is good and when something is
[1:26:20] bad. If something belongs and something
[1:26:22] cannot be used of God.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And we as sons and daughters of God have
[1:26:30] to yield ourselves to that presence. And
[1:26:35] let me tell you something, it's not
[1:26:36] easy.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; And it's not fun.
[1:26:41] And it's not good for us to go through.
[1:26:45] But we've got to
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; we've got to work on ourselves. We've
[1:26:50] got to recognize when when there's a
[1:26:52] trait in our lives that shouldn't be
[1:26:54] there that we don't just we don't just
[1:26:56] ignore it and say, "Well, it's just my
[1:26:58] nature."
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; You see, that's the problem. It's just
[1:27:03] your nature.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; And so, we can't use that as an excuse
[1:27:10] to be rude and not talk to people and
[1:27:12] not to apologize and to have this
[1:27:14] strain. Well, it's how my family was and
[1:27:16] this is just how I nonsense.
[1:27:20] Yeah,
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; that is immature.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; But we are supposed to take the sword of
[1:27:25] the word and maturity as the bride of
[1:27:28] Jesus Christ and say, "Father,
[1:27:30] this don't belong here."
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to fight it.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to fight this family trait
[1:27:38] that acts in this way. When this
[1:27:39] happens, I'm going to fight against this
[1:27:41] family trait of of of the battle of my
[1:27:44] mind. And I'm going to fight it. And I
[1:27:46] might lose some battles, but I'm gonna
[1:27:48] keep fighting by the sword of the word.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; We need fathers to be present
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; in our lives.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; You know, and some of you might say,
[1:28:06] "Well, I wasn't I was never raised in a
[1:28:09] in a Christian home or going to church,
[1:28:12] but I have a father in the gospel.
[1:28:16] who led me to the Lord.
[1:28:20] And I get so choked up every time I
[1:28:22] think about him and talk about him.
[1:28:24] My my earthly father wasn't a believer
[1:28:26] and it wasn't his fault. But guess what?
[1:28:29] He's a believer now. And so is my mom.
[1:28:32] God just had a different plan for me.
[1:28:35] But we all have a a spiritual father. We
[1:28:38] all have someone that was a father
[1:28:40] figure in our lives that that led us to
[1:28:42] the truth and that kept that that that
[1:28:44] that that
[1:28:46] taught us
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; that taught us discipline that taught us
[1:28:50] consistency that that taught that taught
[1:28:52] us to press on. And so we're all without
[1:28:55] excuse.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to get you to a place tonight
[1:29:00] where there's no more excuses.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:29:04] Because Satan wants to give us excuses
[1:29:07] in our lives, but there's no more
[1:29:08] excuses.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; We should be above excuses.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:18] Your identity doesn't come from the
[1:29:20] church. It doesn't come from mama, but
[1:29:23] it comes from the male. too much of the
[1:29:26] time as message believers, our
[1:29:28] identities in the church,
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; my church,
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; our music, our pastor,
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; our youth group, our this. And all of a
[1:29:39] sudden, you have little you have little
[1:29:41] tussles between churches. Do you know
[1:29:43] why you have them? Is because people's
[1:29:45] identity is in the church and not in the
[1:29:47] word and God. Y
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; the issue with church battling and
[1:29:52] fightings and and stuff like that is
[1:29:54] because our identity has been stolen
[1:29:57] from us as sons and daughters of God in
[1:29:59] the word of God into a church into the
[1:30:02] woman.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; And that's not where we find our
[1:30:05] identity. It's not in the woman. It's in
[1:30:07] the male. It's in the word. It's in God.
[1:30:14] We can look at at at Rebecca and Jacob,
[1:30:18] and I've been wrestling with this
[1:30:19] thought all day because it's not a it's
[1:30:22] not a perfect thought, but it's halfway
[1:30:24] there, so I'm going to use it anyways.
[1:30:27] You know, Rebecca couldn't um couldn't
[1:30:31] give uh Jacob the blessing.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; She couldn't.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; It wasn't hers to give.
[1:30:40] She was the woman.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; The blessing had to come from Isaac.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; And so what did the church do?
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; She she yes, she deceived him, but she
[1:30:51] helped Jacob receive the blessing. The
[1:30:55] birthright was already his cuz God had
[1:30:57] already spoke it. But Esau had already
[1:31:00] given it to Jacob for a mess of pottage.
[1:31:02] He didn't really care about it. He
[1:31:04] didn't really care about the word about
[1:31:05] his inheritance. The only time he cared
[1:31:07] about his inheritance is when he came to
[1:31:09] get it.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; All Esau cared about, this is so good.
[1:31:13] All Esau cared about was the blessings.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; All Jacob cared about was the blessing
[1:31:18] of the firstborn and receiving the
[1:31:20] blessings itself. He didn't care of what
[1:31:22] it took to receive it. He just wanted
[1:31:25] it. He wasn't mad when he gave Jacob the
[1:31:29] the the the birthight.
[1:31:32] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Take it.
[1:31:33] Just give me. I'm so hungry. I'm going
[1:31:35] to die.
[1:31:37] He didn't he didn't care about it then.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; He there's no mention of him ever caring
[1:31:41] about it of of them ever fighting over
[1:31:43] it of him ever asking for it back. It
[1:31:47] was only when the the blessings was now
[1:31:49] going to be showered upon him
[1:31:52] from his father. He was a blessing
[1:31:55] believer.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; All he wanted was blessings. He didn't
[1:31:58] want to sit through the hard times. He
[1:32:00] didn't want to sit through the hard
[1:32:01] sermons. All he wanted was was
[1:32:03] blessings. I just want blessings. You
[1:32:05] know where most people want their
[1:32:06] blessings? They want it in their
[1:32:08] pockets.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; And so he just wanted to be blessed and
[1:32:12] he wanted the firstborn. But uh it was
[1:32:15] he didn't get mad until he until he
[1:32:18] really knew, hey, I'm not getting this.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; So the birthright and the blessing, it
[1:32:23] wasn't for her to give, but the church
[1:32:25] helped Jacob get the blessing.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Now, was it right in how she did it?
[1:32:30] That's where I'm struggling with the the
[1:32:33] thought. You feel me?
[1:32:35] because it wasn't right, but yet it was
[1:32:36] all in the plan of God.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; So, it wasn't hers to give. It's not for
[1:32:43] the church to give the blessing. It's
[1:32:45] for the church to lead us to the word to
[1:32:50] the mail that we might receive our
[1:32:52] blessing and our inheritance. It's not
[1:32:56] the churches to give. She can't give it.
[1:32:58] The ministry can't give it to you. It's
[1:33:01] something that God must give. But we
[1:33:03] have to lead you to our heavenly father.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; And so that's where ministries can get
[1:33:08] off is they lead the people to
[1:33:10] themselves as a woman
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; when that's not where we belong.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; We belong to the male.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Nothing against women.
[1:33:22] Hope you don't think that.
[1:33:25] Now listen to this. I'm going to try to
[1:33:27] hurry.
[1:33:29] I know it's Wednesday.
[1:33:33] Brother Brandham said in spiritual
[1:33:35] amnesia, he's talking about amn amnesia
[1:33:39] and what can happen. He says now this is
[1:33:41] paragraph 40. Now worry sometime can
[1:33:44] cause it. He's talking about amnesia.
[1:33:46] And another thing that can cause it
[1:33:48] among the people is getting between two
[1:33:49] opinions. That'll cause amnesia. And it
[1:33:52] gets to you gets you to a place where
[1:33:54] you actually what you've done. You've
[1:33:56] lost your reasons. You've lost your
[1:33:58] mind. Why? Getting between two opinions.
[1:34:02] Don't get between two opinions. Why? It
[1:34:06] can cause amnesia. What is amnesia? It's
[1:34:09] forgetting who you are.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; You start out, you know, like the
[1:34:13] prodical son. He knew who he was. He
[1:34:15] wanted his inheritance, but something
[1:34:17] happened to him. There's a quote in
[1:34:18] here, and I've been reading it and I
[1:34:20] couldn't find it, but brother Brandham
[1:34:21] talks about worldliness.
[1:34:23] That worldliness can cause amnesia. When
[1:34:27] we get our eyes on the world instead of
[1:34:30] the word, it takes our eyes off of off
[1:34:33] of our uh uh um identity and who we are
[1:34:37] and off of our inheritance. And it
[1:34:40] actually changes who we are as
[1:34:43] believers. Just like Nebuchadnezzar, he
[1:34:46] was a king, but he lost his identity and
[1:34:48] he became a beast.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; So, we can lose our identity though we
[1:34:54] start off good. How do we lose it? We
[1:34:58] lose it through stress. That's another
[1:35:00] way. Brother Brandham said we lose it
[1:35:01] through war. And he said we lose it. We
[1:35:03] we we we get amnesia. We lose our
[1:35:06] identity when we're stuck between two
[1:35:09] opinions.
[1:35:11] If you want to keep your identity, don't
[1:35:13] take the opinion of the world and the
[1:35:15] opinion of the word. Take the opinion of
[1:35:17] the word.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it'll cause you to stray
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; and to lose who you really are.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, ' That's so easy today.
[1:35:28] Paragraph 45. And we forget sometimes
[1:35:30] what the Christian church is. We act
[1:35:34] like the world. That shows that we got
[1:35:37] spiritual amnesia because that you don't
[1:35:39] like the Christian. You you don't act
[1:35:42] like the Christian, you act like the
[1:35:44] world. You receive the heart of the
[1:35:46] world and it causes this. So what is it
[1:35:49] that causes amnesia? He says it happens
[1:35:52] to the Christian church. We act like the
[1:35:55] world. It's not just for young people.
[1:35:59] It's for middle-aged people and it's for
[1:36:01] old people alike. We let the world creep
[1:36:04] into our lives and we get stuck between
[1:36:07] two opinions and we start acting like
[1:36:09] the world instead of the word and we
[1:36:12] lose our identity as sons and daughters
[1:36:14] of God.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; So as God's people in these last days
[1:36:19] has forgotten what the testimony of
[1:36:21] being a Christian means.
[1:36:23] It's again this amnesia has become upon
[1:36:26] the people. They can't identify
[1:36:29] themselves. He's saying they're acting
[1:36:31] like the world instead of the word.
[1:36:34] Therefore, they're they have forgotten
[1:36:35] who they are and they can't identify
[1:36:38] themselves.
[1:36:40] They forgot all about it. They had
[1:36:42] forgot his holiness. They had forgot his
[1:36:44] law. The women were living like the rest
[1:36:46] of the women. He's talking about Israel
[1:36:49] in the time of Amos. Go listen to the
[1:36:51] sermon. It's phenomenal. As the
[1:36:53] musicians come, we'll bring this to a
[1:36:55] close.
[1:36:58] So now we need to be careful that we
[1:37:01] don't let the things of the world creep
[1:37:04] in to our lives, to our homes, and to
[1:37:07] the church.
[1:37:09] Because when it does, what happens?
[1:37:13] We get amnesia.
[1:37:15] We forget who we are. We forget who we
[1:37:17] belong to. We get stuck between two
[1:37:19] opinions and we think, "My goodness,
[1:37:22] this is such a such a struggle. I don't
[1:37:24] understand why." It's because we're
[1:37:26] stuck between two opinions. We've let a
[1:37:28] a YouTube video come in here and
[1:37:31] something else come in over there and
[1:37:33] and all of a sudden within our homes,
[1:37:35] within our lives, and within our church,
[1:37:37] we've lost the sincerity that we once
[1:37:39] had. Y
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; I just have such a such a burden on my
[1:37:46] heart
[1:37:48] that you kind of see the direction of of
[1:37:51] of of
[1:37:53] the message. And when I talk about the
[1:37:55] message, I don't mean about the word.
[1:37:57] I'm not talking about the male. I'm
[1:37:59] talking about the female.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; And I'm talking about the children, the
[1:38:03] families.
[1:38:05] There's things that are come into our
[1:38:07] lives and into our homes that 50 years
[1:38:10] ago never would have been thought of.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; We see people dressing and acting and
[1:38:18] and and and and in ways that 10 years
[1:38:22] ago never would have been accepted.
[1:38:27] What's going on?
[1:38:29] Like what's it's a it's a question.
[1:38:33] What's happening?
[1:38:35] Like what direction is our families
[1:38:37] going in? What direction is the young
[1:38:40] girls going in with with with with dress
[1:38:43] and how they present themselves and and
[1:38:46] how boys act and how they act around
[1:38:49] other other girls and how we married
[1:38:52] people act around each other's wives and
[1:38:56] like where where are we going, man?
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:01] What's happening?
[1:39:03] [Music]
[1:39:06] We're letting We're changing one word.
[1:39:09] We're letting the world in instead of
[1:39:11] the word.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; And we're kicking the word out instead
[1:39:14] of the world.
[1:39:17] Can't argue with that.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; it's true.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; We see it.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; And it's a battle within our own all of
[1:39:26] our lives.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:28] But understand, we we got to fight
[1:39:30] against it.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Like, what are we supposed to do? Are we
[1:39:33] supposed to just like are we supposed to
[1:39:35] just lay down and just say, "Well, you
[1:39:38] know, it is what it is and and uh times
[1:39:41] have changed and and and you know, the
[1:39:44] the days of the legalism and the message
[1:39:46] is gone and and and now we can be free
[1:39:49] and just let people act and dress
[1:39:51] however they want and you just don't say
[1:39:52] anything and just let God do the let God
[1:39:55] do the the work."
[1:39:57] How can God do the word without a voice?
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Do you feel Do you feel it? Like
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; You feel the pain.
[1:40:10] It's not right.
[1:40:12] [Music]
[1:40:14] Like what direction are we going as a as
[1:40:18] the bride of Jesus Christ?
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:24] [Music]
[1:40:26] But the buck has got to stop somewhere,
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; We just continue on and say, "Well, you
[1:40:37] know, just just love the person and
[1:40:39] don't say anything and you might offend
[1:40:41] people and whatever." But but real love,
[1:40:44] you got to tell somebody,
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; you got to tell them what's up,
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; right? For lack of better terms.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; And it's not because of hate. And it's
[1:40:55] not because of putting somebody under
[1:40:56] the thumb. No, it's because of love.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; We're just gone. And I'm not, you might
[1:41:04] think I'm talking about the church here.
[1:41:07] I'm I'm talking about I'm talking about
[1:41:10] churches message families within the
[1:41:12] church worldwide.
[1:41:16] And of course, it comes into our own
[1:41:18] lives. And of course, it comes into our
[1:41:20] own church.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; But I'm just talking
[1:41:24] throwing a massive net out there.
[1:41:27] And I want to ask you the question, what
[1:41:30] direction are you going in?
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; What direction is your family going in?
[1:41:39] Are you just laying on the couch not
[1:41:42] doing anything about it?
[1:41:45] Are you going to decide and say, "You
[1:41:47] know what? The young man is right. He
[1:41:50] spoke the word tonight.
[1:41:52] He's used the quotes. It's it's it's
[1:41:54] it's all been in order. I I see it
[1:41:56] through the scripture. I He's right.
[1:41:59] What am I going to do about it?
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do about it?
[1:42:06] What are you going to do about the lack
[1:42:08] of sincerity,
[1:42:10] the lack of dedication?
[1:42:13] What are you going to do about the world
[1:42:14] creeping into your house? What are you
[1:42:16] going to do about it?
[1:42:19] I'm going to try my best to fight
[1:42:21] against it.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz I am not of the world.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; And I don't want to be a part of the
[1:42:30] world.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; But my identity is found in the word.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; And I want to be of the word. And I want
[1:42:38] to live the word
[1:42:40] because my life is a mirror of my
[1:42:44] identity of who I say I am.
[1:42:48] and so's yours. That's right.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; And so tonight, I I trust that you can
[1:42:55] take this little sermon and and you
[1:42:57] might think, well, it's just for the
[1:42:58] men. Yeah, it's a lot. It's a lot for
[1:43:01] for the men and for the
[1:43:04] something for the young singles to think
[1:43:05] about for the future,
[1:43:08] but it's also for everybody. Amen.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do about the
[1:43:13] creeping in of the world into your home
[1:43:15] and into your life?
[1:43:18] The choice is yours.
[1:43:20] The ministry can't make you do anything.
[1:43:25] Once you leave the building and you go
[1:43:26] to your car and and you go to your home
[1:43:29] and that's your that's your place. And
[1:43:33] what you do there, I guess, is up to
[1:43:36] you. What I do there is up to me, but I
[1:43:40] realize it has an effect on everybody
[1:43:42] else within the assembly.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Because when Aken did what he did, it
[1:43:46] didn't just affect his family. It
[1:43:47] affected everybody within the church.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:43:54] Traits, strains, family, upbringings.
[1:44:02] Wow.
[1:44:04] things that we all have to deal with,
[1:44:08] but it's things that you and I can
[1:44:11] overcome.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; God has put the battle before you. He
[1:44:17] has laid the word out on your plate
[1:44:19] tonight. Now, the choice is all up to
[1:44:23] you. The blood, as we would say, is off
[1:44:26] my hands. But yet, it's back on me.
[1:44:31] Because now, what am I going to do with
[1:44:34] the word that God has placed in my heart
[1:44:36] to speak to the church tonight? By God's
[1:44:39] grace.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to press on.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; By God's grace, I'm going to apply the
[1:44:46] token.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; By God's grace, I'm going to get off the
[1:44:49] couch.
[1:44:54] [Music]
[1:44:56] You know, if you didn't laugh, you would
[1:44:58] cry.
[1:45:00] And I'm crying. I'm trying to laugh. So,
[1:45:02] I stop crying
[1:45:05] cuz I realize it's a constant battle.
[1:45:09] And I realize that God is doing
[1:45:12] something. Something.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; What is God doing right now? You want to
[1:45:18] know what God is doing? God's bringing
[1:45:20] us up a little bit higher.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; God has taken us from an identity in a
[1:45:27] church to identity in the word because
[1:45:30] you can't take the church home with you.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; But you can take the word home with you.
[1:45:36] You can take the spirit of God home with
[1:45:38] you. And then you can apply the spirit
[1:45:40] of God to your home to where it's like
[1:45:43] the atmosphere of church in our homes.
[1:45:48] We can't bring you all with us. You
[1:45:50] can't take me home and I'm not taking
[1:45:52] you home. My house is full enough.
[1:45:58] But we can take him home.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; And we can let him do a work in our
[1:46:03] lives. And we can let him clean up our
[1:46:06] lives, clean up our spirits, clean up
[1:46:08] our hearts,
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; clean up our children's lives, so on and
[1:46:11] so forth. What a mighty God we serve.
[1:46:14] Huh? Let's all stand to our feet
[1:46:16] tonight.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Father God, I am in
[1:46:22] awe of you, Lord.
[1:46:25] And I am in awe of your word and your
[1:46:28] spirit, Lord.
[1:46:33] Thank you, Father, for this word.
[1:46:37] And I thank you that your word will
[1:46:39] never return void. And so therefore I I
[1:46:42] have confidence, Lord, not in myself,
[1:46:46] not in the presentation,
[1:46:48] not in the words that I spoke, but Lord,
[1:46:51] in the power of your Holy Spirit, that
[1:46:54] when it anoints the word to our lives,
[1:46:57] it brings a change, Lord. And Father,
[1:46:59] that's our desires this evening. So I
[1:47:01] pray, Lord, that you would you would
[1:47:04] please bless your children,
[1:47:07] those who identify, Lord, as sons and
[1:47:09] daughters of God. God, I ask you would
[1:47:11] give them power to overcome, strength to
[1:47:14] fight the battle, Lord, and to press on
[1:47:17] and keep on keeping on. We love you,
[1:47:19] Father. We commit this service, our
[1:47:22] families, everything, Lord, into thy
[1:47:24] hands for thy kingdom's glory in Jesus
[1:47:28] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you.
[1:47:39] If we could have the words to that song,
[1:47:41] please. What song is that, sister? Go
[1:47:43] ahead, Justin.
