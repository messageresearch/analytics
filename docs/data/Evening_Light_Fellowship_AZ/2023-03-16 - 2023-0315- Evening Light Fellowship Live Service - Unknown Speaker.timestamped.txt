[2:32] line
[2:35] walked away from love one time
[2:43] too many
[2:46] [Music]
[2:48] and I thought I'd use the ball the

[3:09] put on my
[3:12] knees I found to my

[4:14] every morning

[4:36] not knowing
[4:41] but every day

[5:30] oh there's one thing I know for sure
[5:36] fresh as the morning to
[5:40] make your mercy new
[5:46] every morning
[5:50] amen blessed be his name
[5:53] just a couple of prayer requests tonight
[5:55] for the war in Arkansas is down in
[5:57] Mexico preaching so you want to remember
[5:58] for the war and pray Lord be with him
[6:00] the Wallace family will be traveling up
[6:02] to Canada visit families so pray the
[6:04] Lord goes with wallaces and ask you to
[6:07] remember my sister Carrie she lives up
[6:09] in Calgary and she's been battling with
[6:11] Ms for a number of years now and she I
[6:14] found out yesterday she went in for a
[6:16] surgery for a brain bleed and even
[6:18] though she was in the hospital but
[6:20] surgery apparently went well but now
[6:22] there's
[6:23] hoping that she recovers quickly so I'd
[6:26] ask that you remember her in prayer and
[6:27] most of all the Lord would deal with
[6:29] their heart
[6:30] she's one of those prodigals
[6:32] has been away for so long
[6:36] he's more than able I believe that
[6:38] tonight
[6:39] Amen brother Ron's going to come and
[6:41] give an update on brother Neil and take
[6:43] our request to the Lord tonight
[6:46] [Music]
[6:52] God bless you all this evening
[6:55] I'll give you an update with brother
[6:57] Neil Mater
[6:59] as you know that he had what they call
[7:01] arterial dissection
[7:04] which is a part of the aorta there at
[7:07] the heart
[7:09] and the wall of the aorta separated
[7:13] and when it does
[7:16] and it pulls away there's layers inside
[7:19] of the vein
[7:21] and when it does it makes a bulge
[7:24] but it didn't burst
[7:27] they said that was the first mirror
[7:30] actually the ambulance driver said we
[7:32] have aortic descent dissection here
[7:37] and they say 95 percent chance he won't
[7:41] make it to the hospital
[7:42] [Music]
[7:43] when he got to the hospital they had to
[7:46] transfer him to another hospital
[7:48] so they didn't even do it by ambulance
[7:50] they did it by uh air ambulance
[7:54] and so there was
[7:57] multitudes of complications going into
[8:00] the surgery
[8:01] let me put it real simple in layman's
[8:03] terms because we not knowing all of the
[8:06] terminology the doctors use
[8:09] but the doctor explained it to me today
[8:11] he said what happened is when this vein
[8:15] begins to separate all of the junk he
[8:18] calls it the trash
[8:20] all of the trash that separates inside
[8:22] that that artery wall now gets threat uh
[8:27] thrust through the body through the
[8:30] vascular system
[8:32] and so all of the trash they said has
[8:37] gone to the extremities now you know the
[8:39] smallest blood vessels in the body the
[8:42] capillaries are in the toes the digits
[8:46] your nose those are the smallest so if
[8:49] you get that clogged up
[8:52] then you have a discoloration because
[8:55] oxygen is not getting to those
[8:58] extremities
[8:59] his toes have turned purple his
[9:02] fingertips
[9:03] uh his nose
[9:07] and they're doing everything that they
[9:09] can
[9:10] the doctor told me today I spoke to the
[9:13] surgeon Dr Savage
[9:16] he said we're doing everything we know
[9:19] we're doing dialysis
[9:21] to help to try to to clean the blood
[9:25] uh and everything but said
[9:29] we have no remedy for this
[9:32] and I thought okay
[9:33] I have a court of appeal
[9:38] Hallelujah when doctors say we have done
[9:41] everything we can yes stand back because
[9:44] now Dr Jesus
[9:46] I believe that God who can raise the
[9:49] dead he can who he who made the body he
[9:52] who made the whole system God all you
[9:54] got to do
[9:56] is just come down let your angels go by
[10:00] touch him he he needs he he needs a
[10:04] greater Miracle right now than he's ever
[10:06] needed amen so I don't want us to slack
[10:09] off on the prayer
[10:10] I want us how many of you say I'll
[10:13] remember brother Neil I'll call his name
[10:15] mornings evenings when I go to bed when
[10:18] you have your your devotions call his
[10:21] name out he needs it the family needs it
[10:24] yes
[10:26] amen
[10:27] also too sister Rebecca my daughter did
[10:31] not have her second chemotherapy
[10:33] treatment today because her white blood
[10:35] cells were not high enough
[10:38] and so now I don't understand all the
[10:41] the deal but it's got to be so high for
[10:43] them to be able to come in and do
[10:45] whatever they got to do
[10:46] and so it'll be another week for that so
[10:49] just remember her in prayer
[10:52] but how many of you have got a need
[10:54] tonight say I need God to come down
[10:57] physical mental spiritual he is Jehovah
[11:04] heavenly father as we lift our hands
[11:06] before you this evening
[11:08] we bring these prayer requests to you
[11:11] each one that has been been read and
[11:14] spoken father we bring them before you
[11:16] but right now I'm I'm asking for the
[11:19] angels of Mercy
[11:21] to now go and to be at the bedside of
[11:25] our brother Neil
[11:27] father
[11:28] the doctors have doctored they've cut
[11:30] they've given the medication but Lord
[11:33] It's You
[11:34] that causes the healing to the body
[11:37] we're asking father that the great
[11:40] virtue of the blood of Jesus Christ you
[11:43] said by your stripes we are healed I'm
[11:47] asking father let that healing virtue be
[11:50] his portion this evening we commit
[11:53] everything into thy hands we believe you
[11:56] and we trust you and we call upon that
[11:59] mighty name in the name of the Lord
[12:01] Jesus Christ

[25:41] all Praises do I stand in awe of you
[25:53] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[25:56] Christ
[25:57] it is uh certainly a privilege to be in
[26:01] the house of the Lord
[26:03] without any delay will take our Bibles
[26:22] are going to read in the book of Hebrews
[26:26] chapter 1.
[26:29] verse 7 and we'll skip to verse 14.
[26:36] and to the angels He said who maketh his
[26:39] Angel spirits and Minister and his
[26:42] ministers a flame of fire
[26:45] verse 14 are they not all ministering
[26:49] Spirits sent from or send forth to them
[26:52] to minister for them who shall be heirs
[26:55] or salvation
[26:58] shall we pray
[27:01] Heavenly Father
[27:02] once again we're standing in thy
[27:06] presence
[27:07] because it is not a privilege
[27:11] but it is by your grace father
[27:14] because we were lost and casting the
[27:18] darkness away from thy presence
[27:21] but the blood came about and restore the
[27:24] father God the pathway again
[27:27] we do not take this time just as another
[27:31] routine
[27:32] but Lord we take into consideration that
[27:36] in the Garden of Eden such a moment were
[27:39] taking place
[27:40] and when the men step out of law father
[27:44] God the light
[27:45] you had the fellowship with them Father
[27:48] and they knew how to proceed onto the
[27:51] next day
[27:54] father unto us tonight
[27:57] so as we stand in thy presence may you
[28:00] lead us as we ask and pray in Jesus
[28:03] Christ's name amen you may be seated
[28:09] uh
[28:11] as the pastor
[28:15] said it previously I am a brother martin
[28:18] mulumba
[28:20] I've been uh
[28:23] here in Arizona for about seven months
[28:28] and uh the Lord has
[28:32] relocated me from Colorado where I lived
[28:35] for the last 10 years
[28:39] and in the journey
[28:42] he has allowed us to
[28:45] labor in different places by his grace
[28:49] and here we are now at a different stage
[28:54] of the work and I've been also
[29:01] partaking and participating to the
[29:03] services here
[29:05] for the last seven months
[29:08] it has been surely uh a journey
[29:14] that
[29:16] I didn't think about that one day I'll
[29:19] find myself in such a environment
[29:22] but uh he pushed for two years in
[29:26] Colorado you have to go you have to go
[29:29] I did not know what he had in store but
[29:32] he knew what he had in store
[29:35] only had to obey when he told me to come
[29:40] and when I was ready to come or when At
[29:43] Last I obeyed him
[29:45] he uh he told me to reach out to brother
[29:49] Joshua mukibai one of the deacons in the
[29:51] church
[29:52] I did not know everything that he was
[29:56] here and through
[29:58] when I got here then he introduced me by
[30:02] God's grace with her brother Warren
[30:05] and from Brother Warren we went to
[30:08] Mexico and have been going on to Mexico
[30:12] since so
[30:14] back to back
[30:16] and here now I was one of I believe last
[30:22] year
[30:23] uh I wanted to talk to the pastor
[30:26] regarding some other stuff but I did not
[30:28] know
[30:29] how to proceed and I did not want it to
[30:32] be
[30:34] um something man-made
[30:37] but uh while I was sitting there and
[30:40] praying when I finished he was just say
[30:42] standing there and waiting for me
[30:44] instead
[30:45] and he came and he started talking to me
[30:49] about some other things and I didn't
[30:50] even speak to him about what I wanted to
[30:52] to talk to him
[30:54] and when we met again then
[30:57] we shared everything that I could share
[31:00] about my life you know when you have a
[31:04] 30 years live it's uh with one hour
[31:08] meeting it's very you have to condense
[31:10] everything
[31:13] and here now we are to do God's work and
[31:18] to labor for him
[31:21] and he has put on my heart to share a
[31:25] little sermon
[31:28] that looking at it I dodged the first
[31:33] one that he had given me
[31:35] because I felt it was a little too
[31:40] tough on me to bring it but has his God
[31:45] then he has his program
[31:47] he always shows that he's the one
[31:50] leading
[31:51] uh
[31:53] he gave it to another Minister here
[31:56] and he preached it
[31:58] so that was a way for me to understand
[32:01] like you have to do what I tell you to
[32:03] do
[32:04] so and now tonight I am convinced that I
[32:08] have to bring this one here
[32:11] um
[32:12] he showed it twice the third time he
[32:15] came through somebody else and the
[32:17] fourth time he came to me
[32:19] this afternoon
[32:21] when I seated there and the whole entire
[32:24] sermon came through but abrana Maisie
[32:27] was preaching and I said well at least
[32:30] people if they doubt on it they can go
[32:33] back to brother Branham and compare it
[32:35] they can go back to the message and the
[32:37] Bible they can check it out
[32:40] so by God's grace you'll be praying for
[32:43] me
[32:46] um as will be uh traveling standing here
[32:50] for the next few minutes hopefully I
[32:54] won't be too long or too short but just
[32:57] give exactly what the Lord has in store
[32:59] for us
[33:00] uh for tonight I'm going to take
[33:04] um a little subject on work of the
[33:07] ministry
[33:08] we understand that as Believers
[33:13] we are workers in God's Vineyard
[33:19] and we see in the book of Hebrews that
[33:24] Paul the seed the prophet
[33:27] to the Gentiles or the first prophet to
[33:31] the Gentiles
[33:32] had a different type of churches that he
[33:35] dealt with the Corinthians and the
[33:38] Philippians and the Hebrews and each one
[33:42] of them had a portion of work or a
[33:45] different stage of the ministry that
[33:47] they found themselves in
[33:49] and to each one of them he was dealing
[33:54] with them according to the level
[33:56] and the prophet says and shows us that
[34:01] that's where the church has to go back
[34:03] to because that was at the standard that
[34:07] we have as a pattern or as an example to
[34:10] go back to
[34:12] and these people the way
[34:16] churches or cities in areas where they
[34:20] called Colossians
[34:23] because they were part of Colossus or
[34:26] Hebrews because they offer set on tribe
[34:29] or if a certain country
[34:31] but these things are given to us with
[34:34] the understanding of the Revelation that
[34:37] it is a stage of the ministry that's why
[34:41] we're taking the work of the ministry
[34:43] we've come across the journey as the
[34:47] Lord has brought his servants around and
[34:51] brought different messages of coming out
[34:54] of Egypt
[34:57] um bringing it about and they were shown
[35:01] throughout the desert and different
[35:04] things that were happening those who
[35:07] wanted to take Moses place and those who
[35:10] wanted to become what Moses was those
[35:14] who only stay on this side Journey
[35:18] but on this night we want to be in the
[35:22] land
[35:23] we want to be in our position
[35:26] we want to be where we are because after
[35:30] all these years that this church have
[35:32] been around surely different stages
[35:35] different levels different experiences
[35:37] different things that people have been
[35:39] able to achieve
[35:41] therefore it shows us that therefore
[35:44] there's nothing new Under the Sun
[35:46] to every season there's a purpose
[35:50] when you find yourself in the stage
[35:52] where you are in there's a reason to it
[35:54] and when the Lord comes around to awaken
[35:57] us to push us forward there is a reason
[36:00] for it and now it requires now to the
[36:03] people to receive it and capitalize upon
[36:06] it
[36:07] otherwise it just becomes a church
[36:10] routine let's go let's let's listen to
[36:12] another sermon let's go and see who's
[36:14] preaching I'm not really convinced about
[36:17] it so as Ministry I don't think you
[36:19] should preach to me and all that then we
[36:22] start spinning around
[36:24] but then when the Joshua brought the
[36:26] people in the land they say look at the
[36:28] land you have so much land
[36:31] 15 year old learn to conquer 12
[36:33] two-year-old land to conquer 50 year old
[36:37] than to conquer and all these people
[36:39] were lands that had to be conquered and
[36:42] has they found themselves in the land
[36:45] then the question was
[36:48] how do we conquer
[36:51] because we do come and we listen sermons
[36:54] after sermons we say Amen we are the
[36:56] bride yes of course we are the bride
[36:58] because this message was sent to the
[37:00] bride
[37:01] but yet at the same time in every church
[37:04] we understand this two three types of
[37:07] Believers and Believers so-called
[37:09] believer the unbeliever
[37:11] and all these people when they find
[37:13] themselves in this environments
[37:16] are we going to call the unbeliever
[37:18] because they are just in the church
[37:21] because it is also a stage
[37:24] because the child is born two years old
[37:27] he doesn't understand what's going on in
[37:29] the church what do we go to church
[37:32] it's a statue of the ministry
[37:36] we go to church I follow the parents
[37:38] it's it's a makeup believer because it
[37:41] just understand like you know we have to
[37:43] go daddy say we have to go and at times
[37:46] that it has to impose himself we have to
[37:49] go to church
[37:50] because we know we have to go to church
[37:53] but there's also those who are believers
[37:56] I believe this message will follow my
[37:58] heart
[37:59] they are in the message it is a stage of
[38:02] the ministry
[38:03] but then there's also another stage of
[38:06] adoption where somebody comes to
[38:10] understand like Oh I'm a minister God
[38:12] has called me for this I I am this I am
[38:15] that and all those positions we have in
[38:17] the church
[38:19] but then in that position that we have
[38:22] in the church
[38:24] that's where the work of the ministry
[38:26] steps into view
[38:28] because we see that in the word Jesus
[38:32] says John 14 26 that but when the
[38:36] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[38:39] the father will send in my name he shall
[38:42] teach you all things and bring all
[38:45] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[38:48] have said unto you
[38:50] the Lord is showing that the church was
[38:52] at a certain stage
[38:54] you go to the upper room you receive the
[38:57] Holy Ghost through all these experiences
[38:59] as some of us have dates place and
[39:02] timing and everything like I received
[39:05] the Holy Ghost at this stage
[39:08] but then now the person now gets into
[39:11] the work
[39:12] different level
[39:15] of experience on what you do and how you
[39:18] do it and Jesus said when the Holy
[39:21] Spirit shall come he shall teach you all
[39:24] things and when he's teaching you all
[39:27] things is also teaching you on how to
[39:31] work
[39:32] the portion of land that you have to
[39:34] conquer
[39:36] because uh the the rubinites and the
[39:39] rest of them let were outside of the
[39:42] land where that was given to them on
[39:44] this side Jordan because he was on the
[39:47] eastern part of the land but they did
[39:49] not cross all the way into the land but
[39:52] now to those of us who have come into
[39:56] the land we have now a position in our
[39:59] land
[40:00] and at times we have already conquered
[40:04] Our Land
[40:06] I am a minister I'm not out there
[40:09] drinking smoking and doing all these
[40:12] stupid things because I am into my land
[40:16] but then Joshua says but there's still
[40:19] much more land to conquer
[40:22] but now to this person now at times when
[40:26] we get to that level we forget like you
[40:28] know oh I've made it yeah that's it I
[40:31] can just like you know cross my legs no
[40:33] Joshua said there's more land to conquer
[40:37] and as now the land comes into view the
[40:41] Holy Spirit should come
[40:43] to teach us on how to conquer the land
[40:47] because in the book of
[40:50] Joshua 13 the Bible said balam also the
[40:54] son of of of beer the soothsayer did the
[40:58] children of Israel slay with the sword
[41:01] among them that were slain by them the
[41:04] people come came into the land they find
[41:06] like you know hey this is one of the guy
[41:09] who caused us so much trouble the
[41:12] Nicolaitans
[41:14] the balamism the religion religion of
[41:17] Jezebel all these things we've slayed
[41:20] them
[41:21] we not under somebody trying to dominate
[41:24] upon us we're not an organization we're
[41:27] not after this or that Pastor or this
[41:30] great man or that great man
[41:33] they did slay balam they did remove all
[41:36] the filthy things among them
[41:38] but then in Joshua chapter 1 chapter 1
[41:41] uh chapter
[41:44] let me find it
[41:46] when the autopilot kicks in it's always
[41:49] hard to follow up with the notes
[41:52] yeah
[41:54] in Joshua they said we're going to
[41:58] actually judge you subject chapter one
[42:03] now after the death of Joshua it came to
[42:06] pass that the children of Israel asked
[42:09] the Lord
[42:10] saying who shall go up for us against
[42:13] the Canaanite first to fight against
[42:16] them because they were already in the
[42:19] land
[42:20] and the Holy Spirit that had to be in a
[42:22] relationship with people because
[42:24] verbanum teaches us you cannot come on
[42:27] the pulpit get married do whatsoever
[42:29] without being filled with the Holy
[42:31] Spirit here now we have also they said
[42:33] the children of Israel standing there
[42:35] looking at the scene they say well we
[42:38] have a challenge there are invasions in
[42:40] the land disease and financial issues
[42:43] and health risk and all these things
[42:46] they say now who shall go before us
[42:51] because there's a situation in the land
[42:54] we find ourselves that hey
[42:56] work must be done
[42:59] but then they are also among us we
[43:01] understand like you know we have people
[43:03] among us who are mature who are blessed
[43:06] who are placed in the body but then who
[43:08] shall go in this time in this position
[43:11] go and do the work for us
[43:14] so now we understand now in this
[43:16] position now the Lord said Judah shall
[43:20] go up behold I have delivered the land
[43:23] into his hand
[43:25] and Judah said unto see me on his
[43:27] brother
[43:28] come up with me unto my lot that we may
[43:32] fight against the Canaanite and likewise
[43:35] will I will go with the into dialogue
[43:39] Simon went with him
[43:42] so in this case Simon comes up and said
[43:46] well you have a Ministry and you call
[43:49] for my help and will go now to fight
[43:52] that of course the Lord have already
[43:55] given us Victory we'll go and you'll you
[43:58] are the Overcomer you are the pure bride
[44:02] you've overcame laodicea and all these
[44:05] things but now here now another stage of
[44:07] the work
[44:08] in the land not outside of the land
[44:11] where we stand and we look at the
[44:13] situation we understand what shall we do
[44:16] what kind of person shall we have go
[44:20] before us to fight in this situation the
[44:24] Lord said we have a brother here we have
[44:27] a sister here who have kept her virtue
[44:30] all these years I believe that she's the
[44:33] right person to be the testimony for the
[44:35] people
[44:36] we have a minister here we have somebody
[44:39] in the church in the body that has to go
[44:42] and do the work
[44:44] but now this person now goes into a land
[44:47] he has the promise he has the
[44:51] understanding that the Lord has given me
[44:54] this ministry he has given me the work
[44:57] to do but then when it goes now as the
[45:00] brother brought him said when I go into
[45:03] the field it's if the Lord told me to go
[45:06] into the field I am assured that I'll
[45:09] have victory that he will take care of
[45:11] me but now the reason now the Lord is
[45:15] bringing out this element is to paint
[45:18] the picture
[45:19] that while we still here on Earth we
[45:22] have to be able to understand what's
[45:25] going on in the land
[45:27] because Jim says confess your sin one to
[45:31] another but then in this situation now
[45:34] they were able to see Judah was able to
[45:37] say like I have this work to do
[45:40] but I'm unable with myself
[45:43] to go do it all by myself
[45:46] I need a little bit of help here I need
[45:49] a little bit of help there
[45:50] because e Judah understood also that he
[45:55] has people in the church that are also
[45:58] placed filled with the spirit strong
[46:01] enough with experiences to be able to
[46:04] help me in this journey
[46:06] but then when now we find ourselves in
[46:09] the church Barbarian says in the
[46:11] influence it says when are you have
[46:13] people ministers who are not consecrated
[46:19] then people start falling into
[46:22] immorality
[46:24] why because people thought the fact that
[46:27] we have our titles it's good enough for
[46:31] us
[46:32] people talk like it's enough just to sit
[46:34] down and listen to a sermon
[46:37] be called message believer and that
[46:39] should do it
[46:40] but then in that condition the Lord
[46:43] start Awakening them he said after the
[46:47] death of Joshua look at the situation
[46:49] arises after you've listened to all
[46:52] these sermons after you've listened to
[46:54] all these tapes
[46:56] look at the condition of the land
[46:59] because the land is being invited
[47:02] invaded because the Lord said that when
[47:05] you go into the land you shall destroy
[47:08] everything
[47:10] do not leave a one single thing of it
[47:13] she may look so nice when you look at
[47:15] her appearance you say like oh she talks
[47:18] nice all she does the Lord said destroy
[47:21] everything
[47:24] he comes and he shows you how beautiful
[47:28] you are and all these things there's a
[47:31] danger behind it
[47:33] because the descending he did in the god
[47:36] in the Garden of Eden through serpent
[47:39] University she went to school she'll
[47:41] learn all these things but then she did
[47:43] not see the danger coming from removing
[47:46] her from her position to the position
[47:48] she's being placed now
[47:50] because even in this last day the vision
[47:53] was given to the prophet said because of
[47:56] the right given to her
[47:59] given to the church
[48:01] given to her she can now Proclaim
[48:04] herself as if she was something that she
[48:08] was not previously
[48:10] you are beautiful you are already
[48:12] beautiful
[48:14] you are the Church of God
[48:16] but then as the pressure was coming
[48:19] getting closer to the people the people
[48:22] themselves have to understand they had
[48:25] to be Anointed with Israel to be able to
[48:28] see the danger in the land
[48:31] because many times the biggest threat is
[48:34] to have somebody in the church as we
[48:37] have seen it going around the country
[48:38] somebody comes in the church and pretty
[48:41] soon somebody starts shooting people in
[48:43] the church
[48:44] but nobody was able to detect and see
[48:48] the danger coming
[48:50] why because the channel of communication
[48:53] between God and the people have been
[48:56] clogged because people were not in
[48:58] relationship anymore with God
[49:01] because of the work of the Lord was put
[49:04] aside by the red given to them the
[49:08] church had access to the money the
[49:11] church had access to all the Privileges
[49:13] oh why should we pray
[49:18] week I work I have money
[49:21] I have made my investments
[49:24] under the age of uh of uh of um West
[49:28] labor Branham says Wesley said
[49:32] take all you can
[49:34] give all you can save all you can
[49:38] you have the that privilege also today
[49:41] take all you can give all you can save
[49:44] all you can but then in the midst of
[49:47] that time
[49:49] what's going on in the land
[49:52] what's going on with the ministry
[49:54] where is the ministry standing at people
[49:58] were looking not understanding that the
[50:01] time in which we are living in
[50:03] all the wealth is given to laodicea is
[50:06] to Blind her
[50:08] blind wretched naked and don't know it
[50:13] because why the right that was given to
[50:16] her was given to her to put her in that
[50:19] position
[50:21] and through that the Lord said
[50:24] the people said who shall go for us in
[50:28] this situation
[50:29] then Judah has to rise up then Simeon
[50:33] has to rise up and as now Judah and
[50:36] Simeon they were rising and going to
[50:39] fight against these people they were
[50:41] things that had to be taken into
[50:43] consideration
[50:45] people had to know what kind of spirit
[50:47] they were dealing with
[50:50] I am a 15 year old girl my body started
[50:52] changing and getting all this new
[50:55] feelings in the body somebody has to be
[50:59] aware of what kind of invasion that is
[51:02] because the invasion of the United
[51:04] States is through all the media and
[51:06] through all these things and from the
[51:08] United States through the entire world
[51:12] and in the body of Christ
[51:15] Pastor father mother all the all of us
[51:19] each one in his place have these
[51:23] invasions
[51:25] and when these invasions are taking
[51:27] place the Lord has to come on the scene
[51:30] but then when after we pray after we
[51:33] speak after we've been through all
[51:35] prayer there's no answer something has
[51:37] went wrong
[51:38] because George Joshua said Lord you have
[51:42] given us the land how come we're losing
[51:44] all these people
[51:46] because something has happened in the
[51:48] land
[51:49] but then by God's grace he said rise up
[51:54] and as the Lord said Judah shall go up
[51:57] behold I have delivered the land into
[51:59] his hand the Lord has delivered Adam to
[52:02] you but then it does not mean since he
[52:05] has given that to you then we just like
[52:08] you know sit down and close our eyes and
[52:10] let's look and see whatever ah you
[52:13] you're good you'll be just fine no
[52:17] the Lord is awakening us
[52:20] that Joshua is gone
[52:23] but there's still much work to be done
[52:26] the ministry that we have had today
[52:29] the prophet has come physically
[52:31] we have seen him do all that he had to
[52:34] do and physically we've seen the body go
[52:38] do the soul being Eternal though the
[52:41] same angel that was with him is he with
[52:43] us today now the Awakening now of our
[52:46] mind with our eyes is to see what's
[52:49] going on in the land
[52:52] because the danger is so night
[52:57] the danger is so close
[53:00] we go to church
[53:02] time after time you just see the level
[53:05] of spirituality keeps going down and
[53:08] down and down and down
[53:10] why when you look because of wealth
[53:13] because of privileges
[53:16] for those in the third world countries
[53:18] they will pray so much
[53:21] just because they have need of food
[53:25] not necessarily to grow up in the spirit
[53:28] and once they get food there's no more
[53:31] need to pray
[53:34] the Lord now is Awakening the people
[53:37] he said when the Holy Spirit shall come
[53:41] he has to teach you all things
[53:44] as the pastor showed it here
[53:46] look at what's going on with the Baptist
[53:48] Church
[53:50] they're getting all this speaking in
[53:52] tongue left and right
[53:54] but then when you look in the word you
[53:56] find that when Jesus was dying on the
[53:59] cross
[54:01] that's when he died with tongues
[54:04] the time of transition between the time
[54:08] given to the Jews to receive the Messiah
[54:11] was running out
[54:14] and the same time the same way it
[54:17] happened with them the same time the
[54:20] same way also is happening with us
[54:22] where people find themselves in all
[54:25] these luxurious environment luxurious
[54:27] homes the Lord is showing them but look
[54:31] at the impending disaster
[54:33] the Lord has to open the eyes
[54:37] for them to be aware of what's going on
[54:40] in the land
[54:41] otherwise it's just another church
[54:43] routine let's go let's listen to a
[54:46] sermon but then when the spirit comes
[54:48] and said awaken thou sleepest look at
[54:51] the dangers at the door
[54:54] because Matthew 25 he said like while
[54:57] the rest of them they were sitting there
[54:59] they were just like you know okay we are
[55:01] the Holy Spirit yeah we'll get to it
[55:03] sometimes let me get married first let
[55:05] me have my money first let me work first
[55:10] why would they pushing a little bit for
[55:13] later on the reception of the Holy
[55:15] Spirit
[55:16] because they were busy
[55:20] because they had things to do
[55:22] when you look at it it's real our pastor
[55:26] these days really you have to understand
[55:27] yeah I understand you but that's not the
[55:30] word
[55:31] we will understand you as human beings
[55:35] but the word does not change
[55:37] Jesus Christ being the same yesterday
[55:39] today and forever
[55:42] Lord I have been doing this I've been
[55:44] paying my tithes here what is the do you
[55:47] tied to God he doesn't need your tight
[55:51] he needs you
[55:54] because what good is it for a wife
[55:58] to just leave the food on the table the
[56:01] husband comes home but she's not around
[56:06] it needs the whole thing to be set up
[56:09] he needs the whole statue of the perfect
[56:12] man to be built up
[56:15] from your virtue to head all the Seven
[56:18] Virtues
[56:20] it's not just
[56:21] you know for this time I don't have time
[56:23] it's very legitimate for me to go work I
[56:27] don't have time to study the word as
[56:29] much as I wanted to study but then the
[56:32] impending disaster
[56:34] will come to strike you just at the
[56:37] place where you don't have knowledge
[56:40] but then it required you to be awakened
[56:43] to have the necessary knowledge to face
[56:45] the impending disaster
[56:49] because when the voice said like behold
[56:52] the bridegroom is here go meet him it's
[56:55] not a physical move that she is standing
[56:58] there at a certain place but it's a
[57:01] daily walk with him
[57:03] and that belly walk requires not just a
[57:06] opening of a scripture in the morning
[57:08] two verses I'm ready and then let Jesus
[57:10] see you tonight no it's a daily walk
[57:14] it's a every minute walk because there
[57:18] was so much land to conquer and as the
[57:21] Lord the land has to be conquered the
[57:24] Lord has to awaken what's going on
[57:27] within ourselves to understand like look
[57:30] in this area of your life look at what's
[57:33] going on
[57:35] when the Holy Spirit shall come he shall
[57:38] teach you all things
[57:41] and when he's teaching you old things
[57:43] he's being a gentleman watch here read
[57:48] here live this year make your skirt a
[57:52] little longer cover yourself a little
[57:54] bit remove all those extensions don't
[57:57] pinch your hair this way present
[57:59] yourself this way very simple very in a
[58:03] gentleman way
[58:05] but hey the way it does it
[58:08] very foolish to men
[58:11] you know I'm still young I have to put
[58:13] this because the brothers
[58:16] he has a makeup in those Brothers
[58:21] he has a makeup in those sisters for you
[58:25] to meet according to his word
[58:28] because Samson thought he was smarter
[58:34] I am powerful when I go out there I just
[58:37] break everything I don't play with girls
[58:40] you know I don't play with boys but the
[58:43] way it came to him
[58:45] he did not see the impending disaster
[58:49] how are you sister God bless you
[58:53] serpent University they know the
[58:55] language
[58:57] they know the language
[58:59] they study you
[59:01] the message is given to everyone
[59:04] because the unbeliever in the church
[59:07] will learn the language on how to speak
[59:09] to you
[59:10] and you only see the disaster when you
[59:13] get into that relationship
[59:15] and they'll be way too late
[59:20] without the hood this Holy Spirit when
[59:23] the disaster kicks in you just find
[59:26] yourself that I've lost it
[59:30] but then the Lord says you have to work
[59:35] you need to cry in the spirit
[59:39] Lord reveal it unto us
[59:42] because I believe I am seed
[59:45] I have overcome all these years I've
[59:47] been 12 years old 15 years old and all
[59:49] this I've overcome all this I've
[59:51] preached so many sermons I've sung so
[59:54] many songs I've done all this that's
[59:56] good
[59:58] but look the road ahead
[1:00:02] there's so much work to remain
[1:00:05] Jesus said
[1:00:08] he that loves me
[1:00:10] keeps my commandment
[1:00:13] the Commandment is given to us
[1:00:17] to watch and pray
[1:00:19] it's not always mystery there's mystery
[1:00:22] that I am this I am that glory be to God
[1:00:25] yes that's good but do you see the
[1:00:27] impending disaster
[1:00:29] because the devil is not afraid of any
[1:00:31] one of us
[1:00:34] you cry you shout and I am this I am
[1:00:38] that yeah that's fine you're standing
[1:00:40] there is waiting for you right at the
[1:00:41] door
[1:00:42] once you get into your car you turn up
[1:00:44] the same music to the same music you go
[1:00:47] home you watch the same movies
[1:00:49] what is church attendance to us then
[1:00:53] you understand because he knows us very
[1:00:57] well
[1:00:58] he has six thousand years of experience
[1:01:00] more than any one of us combined
[1:01:06] he knows how to address us
[1:01:11] he knows that you know with you I will
[1:01:14] not come as an unbeliever
[1:01:18] with pens and nails and all this no
[1:01:21] he will just like
[1:01:23] but do you think really brother Branham
[1:01:25] said everything right
[1:01:28] he will lead you right in the same Bible
[1:01:30] that you read every day
[1:01:33] to start showing you mistakes in the
[1:01:35] message before you know it like somebody
[1:01:37] at the at the sea takes the clothes and
[1:01:40] puts it right there it gets in the water
[1:01:42] before he knows it is already there but
[1:01:45] the clothes are still here
[1:01:47] slowly but surely you've gone away and
[1:01:50] you don't understand anymore before you
[1:01:52] know it look at those extensions look at
[1:01:55] those short skirts
[1:01:57] you don't know how it happened because
[1:01:59] you were not able to see the impending
[1:02:01] disaster
[1:02:03] because you were blind of what was
[1:02:06] taking place before you
[1:02:12] but the Bible says Deuteronomy 21 if a
[1:02:15] man verse 18 and if a man
[1:02:18] have a stubborn and rebellious son which
[1:02:21] shall not obey the voice of his father
[1:02:23] or the voice of his mother and that when
[1:02:27] they have trust in him will not hearken
[1:02:31] unto them
[1:02:32] then shall his father and his mother
[1:02:36] laid hold of him and bring him out unto
[1:02:39] the Elders of the city and unto the Gate
[1:02:42] of his place
[1:02:45] the people in the land
[1:02:48] in their position the ministers have
[1:02:51] done what they're supposed to do then
[1:02:53] the Lord said I have to bring this
[1:02:55] public
[1:02:57] because when the word is coming forth
[1:03:02] it's only showing the stage the state
[1:03:05] the people are in
[1:03:07] because Verona says if you don't want
[1:03:10] your sins to be brought up here you
[1:03:13] better confess it where you are
[1:03:16] but then when that is coming out from
[1:03:18] the pulpit
[1:03:19] then the Lord has dealt with you already
[1:03:22] in the backyard dealt with you behind it
[1:03:25] and you did not listen then He had to
[1:03:27] bring it out
[1:03:34] how does it work that you know all these
[1:03:37] things you say it's very easy
[1:03:40] you say easy if it was easy I would have
[1:03:43] not asked you the questions like simple
[1:03:45] if they had repented those sins would
[1:03:49] have not been called out
[1:03:52] if the ministry was working the way is
[1:03:55] supposed to work
[1:03:56] the Lord would have spoken about
[1:03:58] something else
[1:04:00] but as is awakening us is brings us to
[1:04:04] the understanding Lord
[1:04:07] surely I've been complacent
[1:04:10] I've got used to the ministry I just
[1:04:13] come prepare a sermon quickly let me
[1:04:16] come and because I have the knowledge
[1:04:19] and all the songs
[1:04:21] yeah I know the church really if I want
[1:04:24] to get the church to this level I'll
[1:04:26] just go and I find this one two three
[1:04:28] four five notes
[1:04:30] let me be on the pulpit
[1:04:33] but he's saying when the Holy Spirit
[1:04:36] shall come
[1:04:38] he the Holy Spirit not you the men
[1:04:43] because the children of Israel Cried
[1:04:46] unto the Lord no they didn't look among
[1:04:49] themselves like who is uh the best
[1:04:51] friend Among Us who has the most
[1:04:53] knowledge of no
[1:04:58] even Judah when he looked his condition
[1:05:00] he asked even for help himself
[1:05:05] but then when we become self-sufficient
[1:05:09] proud of ourselves confident in
[1:05:12] ourselves
[1:05:13] yeah I know I can just go out there and
[1:05:15] do what I'm supposed to do and yeah I'll
[1:05:18] just you know it's just like a mother in
[1:05:20] the kitchen
[1:05:22] she doesn't have to think about what she
[1:05:24] will cook she knows where all the spices
[1:05:26] are and she'll just come and put the the
[1:05:29] the the the pot on the stove and do it
[1:05:32] quickly and that's it
[1:05:34] but that's not the same with the Holy
[1:05:36] Spirit
[1:05:37] the holy spirit is watching the ministry
[1:05:40] to lead the people to a certain stage
[1:05:45] because the people have to be in a
[1:05:47] certain atmosphere to be able to face
[1:05:49] the impending disaster
[1:05:52] so that when the disaster comes just as
[1:05:55] Jesus was with the disciples he said I
[1:05:58] prayed that your flight may not be in
[1:06:01] winter
[1:06:02] just as Paul would tell Timothy said do
[1:06:06] quickly come before winter
[1:06:08] because if you have to travel through
[1:06:10] winter it's going to be very hard for
[1:06:12] you
[1:06:14] many of us will suffered like to travel
[1:06:16] through winter a lot
[1:06:18] we don't listen we only wait until the
[1:06:21] disaster track strikes us then you come
[1:06:23] Pastor I've done this I've backslide he
[1:06:26] lied to me but you were not aware of
[1:06:29] God's plan on how to prevent the
[1:06:31] impending disaster
[1:06:34] approach because there was much land yet
[1:06:38] to be possessed it's not in one day but
[1:06:43] it is a continuation but then when we
[1:06:46] get so relaxed and we find like you know
[1:06:48] we have it we've done it no we haven't
[1:06:51] when we look behind us yes we've done so
[1:06:55] much
[1:06:55] but when we look before us there's still
[1:06:58] more work to do
[1:07:01] and as in our Ministries we have not
[1:07:05] watched the Bible says then shall his
[1:07:08] father and his mother lay hold and bring
[1:07:11] him out of the unto the Elders of the
[1:07:13] city and unto the gates of his place
[1:07:16] and they shall stay they shall say unto
[1:07:18] the Elders of the city
[1:07:20] this our son is stubborn and rebellious
[1:07:24] he will not obey our voice he is a
[1:07:27] gluten
[1:07:28] and a drunker he watches movies all the
[1:07:31] time
[1:07:32] he listens to all this music all the
[1:07:34] time
[1:07:35] it does not listen
[1:07:38] at times why because the environment is
[1:07:42] in they were given that privilege
[1:07:46] they were unable to cleanse
[1:07:50] what will set a good environment for
[1:07:53] them
[1:07:54] say before I get back there
[1:08:01] God's provided a way 1953 paragraph 12
[1:08:05] and I tell you parents
[1:08:08] you put the right kind of a home before
[1:08:10] your children
[1:08:12] that's the thing to do
[1:08:14] because if if I had a Christian home had
[1:08:19] been reared in
[1:08:21] perhaps I have been further along with
[1:08:24] our Lord the Jesus tonight and more
[1:08:27] people would have been saved
[1:08:32] the ministry
[1:08:34] we become so complacent
[1:08:37] oh I I had to fight a little bit with my
[1:08:40] first son my first daughter yeah now now
[1:08:43] I know what to do I'll just talk to them
[1:08:46] this way
[1:08:49] but you don't
[1:08:52] consideration
[1:08:54] with this new type of
[1:08:56] us who have access to all the knowledge
[1:08:59] on the internet
[1:09:01] what you're going to face
[1:09:03] you bring a code he brings a code you
[1:09:06] bring a code she brings a quote
[1:09:09] then you find yourself like you can't do
[1:09:11] anything then you become complacent
[1:09:15] well you just do you I think the Lord
[1:09:17] will lead you and I've done what I've
[1:09:19] been I've done best and that's it
[1:09:23] but William Branham said if you said the
[1:09:26] right type of environment I know this is
[1:09:29] a little bit of multi-level Church home
[1:09:31] personal life and all these things but
[1:09:34] as I'm laying the pattern so we can each
[1:09:36] one of us be able to see it in our own
[1:09:38] lives
[1:09:42] but my but my people was not a religious
[1:09:45] family and and God that just had his
[1:09:48] amazing grace to save me and then since
[1:09:52] then I have led several of them to the
[1:09:55] Lord I've baptized my mother I've uh my
[1:09:59] my father gave his heart to Christ died
[1:10:01] in my in my homes my grandfather I
[1:10:04] baptized him in early 90
[1:10:07] um early 90 in the river some of my
[1:10:10] brothers so forth and all along and my
[1:10:12] boy here and my little girl was over
[1:10:15] seven my other ones all the entire
[1:10:18] family were baptized on things
[1:10:22] he says the Bible go by going back to
[1:10:25] the Bible
[1:10:26] and all the men of this obesity
[1:10:30] shall Stone him with stones
[1:10:34] put evil away from among you and all
[1:10:37] Israel shall hear and fear
[1:10:41] the Lord is showing them
[1:10:43] what's going on
[1:10:46] they have to be aware
[1:10:49] some of the things
[1:10:52] we keep them Secret
[1:10:55] cause
[1:10:57] yeah it's you know we have to do this
[1:11:01] but that was not so in the time of Peter
[1:11:04] and them
[1:11:06] that's where we are going to go back to
[1:11:08] go back to
[1:11:11] ananyas and safira that the plot has a
[1:11:14] family
[1:11:15] they came in the church
[1:11:18] did this happen no
[1:11:21] then the Lord had to call them out
[1:11:24] they had to be cleaned out
[1:11:28] yes they had to die
[1:11:31] I know it's hard yes but they have to
[1:11:33] die
[1:11:35] but the Lord who is rich in Mercy
[1:11:38] gives us more information to understand
[1:11:41] because many times when you read a
[1:11:43] scripture like this oh that means I have
[1:11:45] to become very radical and you know
[1:11:47] that's not it that's not a word
[1:11:51] he says that you shall Stone them
[1:11:54] what is the stone the revelation
[1:11:57] because when you bring the Revelation to
[1:11:59] the people you have to know where they
[1:12:01] at
[1:12:03] because you have to know what's going on
[1:12:05] in their lives first
[1:12:07] to be able to help them out
[1:12:10] because the minister has to kicks into
[1:12:12] place
[1:12:14] the Holy Spirit comes and teaches you
[1:12:16] all things not a part of it but all
[1:12:20] things
[1:12:22] you read the scripture they come to
[1:12:24] bring you the case
[1:12:26] Simeon can you help with this case
[1:12:29] then he tells them
[1:12:31] look at what's going on
[1:12:33] I have them in this place
[1:12:36] can you help them out
[1:12:39] mother
[1:12:42] she just nearly uh she just newly wedded
[1:12:46] can you help her
[1:12:49] Pastor is a new minister
[1:12:52] can you help him
[1:12:54] he's 15 years old
[1:12:56] can you share with him the experiences
[1:13:00] because me as a mother the relationship
[1:13:03] can be tight
[1:13:06] can you help out
[1:13:08] the ministry now
[1:13:11] to show that the condition the person is
[1:13:14] in
[1:13:16] will have to come up before you by the
[1:13:19] help of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:22] because as the spirit is bringing out to
[1:13:25] show the condition of the people the
[1:13:27] people are standing and watching
[1:13:30] what's going to happen
[1:13:33] what am I going to do
[1:13:35] how am I going to deal with this case
[1:13:39] you see sister you pray for that baby
[1:13:43] because as a mother
[1:13:46] you were able to put yourself in that
[1:13:50] shoe better than me
[1:13:54] you watch the ministry
[1:13:56] the Holy Spirit spoke to her go pray for
[1:14:00] the baby
[1:14:05] with that which
[1:14:07] no I am the minister
[1:14:12] I am the one to pray for her
[1:14:14] I've received it no the right purp the
[1:14:18] right people
[1:14:19] at the right place
[1:14:22] the right Ministry at the right time
[1:14:28] that's why they are ministering Spirit
[1:14:31] to minister to The Heirs of salvation
[1:14:37] not everything is done on the pulpit
[1:14:41] but when you are back home
[1:14:44] when you are there on the streets
[1:14:47] when you're standing there
[1:14:50] then you know like uh like Philip that
[1:14:54] the Holy Spirit does not wait for you to
[1:14:56] be ready get ready now because when the
[1:14:59] work comes up you have to be ready to go
[1:15:03] otherwise you'll be scrambling about
[1:15:05] brother go up let's say but brother but
[1:15:08] I need some time first you have to let
[1:15:10] me know ahead of time no
[1:15:13] when did pillow fire was moving you have
[1:15:16] to get ready and go and get moving right
[1:15:18] away
[1:15:19] it was not something about okay that
[1:15:21] said
[1:15:22] Moses wait a little bit I need to go
[1:15:25] find the scripture hey Pastor what is
[1:15:27] that scripture no
[1:15:29] Daddy I am the situation here I see the
[1:15:32] boy is talking to me nice I don't know
[1:15:34] if I have to have to talk to no you have
[1:15:36] to be ready at that time
[1:15:39] because once you get influenced by
[1:15:42] serpent University you gotta all this
[1:15:45] knowledge
[1:15:46] you'll find all the excuses to go that
[1:15:49] path
[1:15:52] and hear now the Lord is showing the
[1:15:55] people
[1:15:56] that when the case of stubbornness
[1:16:00] comes into play you have you the elders
[1:16:05] you who I experience have to have the
[1:16:08] Revelation to Stone them and to kick
[1:16:11] their evil spirit out
[1:16:14] and how do you keep that thing that how
[1:16:17] do you are killed the demons out of the
[1:16:20] people
[1:16:22] you watch the land
[1:16:24] you'll learn the land
[1:16:27] God has given us each one of us
[1:16:30] you watch the music
[1:16:33] you listen to what kind of music is
[1:16:35] being played in the church
[1:16:38] for you to know what's going on in with
[1:16:40] the music
[1:16:42] you watch the dressing with the sisters
[1:16:46] as the prophet says you want to know a
[1:16:48] level of a church
[1:16:49] look at them
[1:16:52] the shorter the skirts are going
[1:16:56] the more immorality you know
[1:17:00] you will not sit there and say oh that
[1:17:02] the brother yeah he is very unspiritual
[1:17:05] but how did you dress that way
[1:17:09] help your brother out
[1:17:12] help your sister out
[1:17:14] be a gentleman brother I'm saying
[1:17:18] the picture being painted
[1:17:21] the work
[1:17:23] being driven by the Holy Spirit
[1:17:26] at the stage in which you find in
[1:17:28] yourself
[1:17:29] married unmarried single anything any
[1:17:32] type of level that you're in
[1:17:34] it brings it about to pinpoint places
[1:17:38] in which you've been we've become
[1:17:41] complacent
[1:17:42] to make us move a little bit further to
[1:17:46] possess our inheritance
[1:17:50] otherwise we look at the situation we
[1:17:54] said I don't see anything wrong with
[1:17:56] this type of dressing
[1:18:00] but you don't see where that type of
[1:18:02] dressing is taking the people
[1:18:07] but you don't see where that type of
[1:18:09] music is taking the people
[1:18:12] it becomes more natural to us
[1:18:16] to watch those movies
[1:18:19] to listen those music to listen to those
[1:18:22] sermons
[1:18:24] because we think that they have
[1:18:25] something to give to us
[1:18:31] some some thought like he was just
[1:18:33] natural to go among the Philistines to
[1:18:36] go and do whatever he wants and lay with
[1:18:38] women and come back home the next day
[1:18:43] he found it very normal
[1:18:46] because he still had the Revelation
[1:18:48] because he still had the knowledge to
[1:18:51] just go pre go read Lord I've seen a go
[1:18:55] and I pray and I find somebody you are
[1:18:57] my friend don't tell this to anybody you
[1:19:00] know I met her we did this and this and
[1:19:02] that okay shall we pray don't do this
[1:19:04] again okay I won't do it again you
[1:19:06] promise I promise
[1:19:08] by the impending disaster to those
[1:19:10] behaviors
[1:19:12] only the Holy Spirit was able to show
[1:19:15] that to them
[1:19:18] otherwise
[1:19:19] it's just a church routine
[1:19:23] yeah he read that scripture and nobody's
[1:19:25] gonna preach yeah you've you've it's
[1:19:28] become common to us
[1:19:32] I don't see anything really special with
[1:19:34] that sermon you know
[1:19:36] oh we've heard Mighty preachers yes you
[1:19:39] have heard Mighty preachers
[1:19:41] that Ministry have brought you so far up
[1:19:44] to here
[1:19:47] but then the rest of the journey you
[1:19:50] need not to be aware
[1:19:52] how to deal with them
[1:19:55] where to deal with them
[1:19:58] they listen to the same things they know
[1:20:00] they know like you know yeah
[1:20:02] yeah message yeah yeah okay yeah that's
[1:20:06] it yeah you've preached the prophet no
[1:20:08] that's not the point
[1:20:11] the devil has access to the do the
[1:20:13] knowledge
[1:20:16] but then the impending disaster
[1:20:18] because remember at the end of it all is
[1:20:23] the rapture but then the rupture has to
[1:20:26] find us in a certain condition
[1:20:28] and that condition is pictured to us
[1:20:30] into the the statue of a perfect man but
[1:20:34] this touch of a perfect man to reach
[1:20:36] that Paul said I have to Die daily
[1:20:40] he said to Timothy give thyself unto
[1:20:43] reading
[1:20:45] every day
[1:20:48] verbalam says we cannot insist so much
[1:20:53] on the importance of Revelation in the
[1:20:56] believer's life
[1:20:58] yes we we are knowledge is one thing
[1:21:04] we deal with Technologies nowadays that
[1:21:07] the children yesterday don't go don't
[1:21:09] visit here Rebecca I don't want you to
[1:21:11] go out there and place that no she's in
[1:21:13] the bedroom doing the very something
[1:21:15] that Rebecca had to go out to do
[1:21:20] how are you able to handle it
[1:21:24] don't worry if I had a TV in my house I
[1:21:27] would have shooting it yes that's good
[1:21:29] but now we don't how many people use TV
[1:21:32] today
[1:21:34] it doesn't even require all of them out
[1:21:37] there they don't even need bottom
[1:21:38] quotation to do not have the TVs
[1:21:42] they have all kinds of applications all
[1:21:45] kinds of channels
[1:21:48] to be able to access with the very thing
[1:21:51] that brother was condemning about
[1:21:56] and when the church
[1:21:58] the Lord says it he said watch the work
[1:22:01] of the ministry
[1:22:04] watch the impending disaster
[1:22:06] look at what is taking place in the land
[1:22:09] the Canaanites are in the land
[1:22:12] but if we are unable to see what's going
[1:22:15] taking on in the land
[1:22:17] then what are we
[1:22:21] sanctification yeah there are people who
[1:22:23] are Sanctified out there
[1:22:27] way Sanctified than we are
[1:22:31] they pay the tithes they give Charities
[1:22:33] and they call it philanthropic and they
[1:22:36] do all these great things
[1:22:38] but that's not the point here
[1:22:42] what profits a man to gain all this
[1:22:45] world
[1:22:46] but to lose its soul
[1:22:49] yes we look at it yeah it's okay we we
[1:22:53] have all these big things and we we
[1:22:56] settle no we're not settle yet
[1:22:59] here we have no controlling City
[1:23:03] it may look so nice he may look so calm
[1:23:06] and so quiet no it's not
[1:23:10] the devil is roaring like a lion seeking
[1:23:14] who to devour
[1:23:17] what good serves us if we have a David
[1:23:20] with the flock of the father and doesn't
[1:23:23] see the Wolves and the Bears and all of
[1:23:25] them that are coming
[1:23:28] what good to Heaven Soul who sits there
[1:23:31] who entertains the Philistines in the
[1:23:34] land
[1:23:36] they come the mechok and the threads and
[1:23:39] that if you say one word I'm going to
[1:23:41] call the police that is shaking oh my
[1:23:43] God oh my God what good is it
[1:23:47] watch the ministry
[1:23:50] watch what went wrong
[1:23:55] those areas
[1:23:57] requires not a public show it requires
[1:24:01] somebody that will go down there and say
[1:24:04] Lord you have given us the land
[1:24:08] what tools shall I have to go and fight
[1:24:11] against the Canaanite
[1:24:13] what tool shall I have to be able to
[1:24:16] fight here he will tell you take
[1:24:18] humility
[1:24:20] take Simon
[1:24:22] you forsaken Simon somewhere
[1:24:25] take back your prayer life
[1:24:29] before having the financial stability
[1:24:31] Lord refuse to do this Lord I will just
[1:24:35] set up the system automatically my Tides
[1:24:38] plus ten percent above
[1:24:41] but that's not the point the Lord is
[1:24:44] showing
[1:24:45] that though you've come to that stage
[1:24:47] that's good
[1:24:50] but now watch the way ahead
[1:24:54] because the enemy as long as we have not
[1:24:57] received the change of the body until
[1:25:01] the anointing upon the Tabernacle comes
[1:25:04] we still have work to do
[1:25:09] the reason the Lord has set us in that
[1:25:11] position is to cry out unto him every
[1:25:14] day look in the land this easier request
[1:25:17] here left here this one is not going on
[1:25:20] that one is not going on but then the
[1:25:22] Lord says Judah
[1:25:25] you need to be able to help
[1:25:28] your ministry should be able to help
[1:25:32] to what extent does your ministry help
[1:25:38] um I just like go to church I I don't
[1:25:41] like to do anything my job is to go pray
[1:25:45] walk out that's it
[1:25:48] but the Lord says you have to do it
[1:25:53] and for you to do it the Holy Spirit
[1:25:56] should come there
[1:25:58] not in their historical the holy spirit
[1:26:01] is like Yahweh you know brother you know
[1:26:04] we've received a prophet that's one
[1:26:05] thing
[1:26:07] like the sons of Shiva we pull we preach
[1:26:09] Paul we preach this is yeah that's good
[1:26:11] Paul we know Branham we know Martin will
[1:26:14] know all of them we know but who are you
[1:26:21] because the demon in that system she was
[1:26:24] crawling like a serpent and said William
[1:26:26] Branham what did it do I have to do with
[1:26:28] you they knew who William Branham was
[1:26:31] do they know who you are
[1:26:35] because when Samson was powerless then
[1:26:39] they started making the fun of him oh
[1:26:42] you came here you were very tight I had
[1:26:44] let's go take a drink
[1:26:47] just just a little bit I don't drink too
[1:26:50] much just a little bit
[1:26:51] then you become the more drunker than
[1:26:54] them the Bible said the sun was what
[1:26:57] first stubborn then what Glutton then
[1:27:01] what drunkard
[1:27:03] one stage leading unto another
[1:27:09] but then the Awakening of the spirit is
[1:27:12] to show the people
[1:27:13] awake watch trim your lamp
[1:27:18] fill it with oil
[1:27:20] why because it's dark
[1:27:23] heavy nothing reserved
[1:27:29] we're not talking about the backside of
[1:27:31] uh of the children right
[1:27:33] we're talking about people in the land
[1:27:37] what they have to do
[1:27:40] and what do we compare that to against
[1:27:43] the pattern
[1:27:46] against Pentacles
[1:27:48] what they were supposed to come back to
[1:27:51] where are we where are we at
[1:27:54] it's not a collective thing
[1:27:56] yeah we had this church no
[1:27:59] but the Lord is watching in those areas
[1:28:02] that the ministry should get into place
[1:28:06] should get into work
[1:28:09] a little bit of bitterness taking place
[1:28:11] a little bit of suspicious spirit
[1:28:14] yeah I'll greet him as a brother you
[1:28:16] know we stopped there
[1:28:19] the spirit is going into those places
[1:28:22] to awaken us
[1:28:24] but when you hear my voice
[1:28:26] Harden not your heart
[1:28:30] it's very gentle
[1:28:32] and when verbalam says he that he loves
[1:28:36] it Justin's and rebukes
[1:28:40] he says
[1:28:45] exposition of church ages
[1:28:49] and now
[1:28:52] the audition to church and now he says
[1:28:54] to his own as many as I love
[1:28:57] I rebuke
[1:28:59] and Justin
[1:29:01] to rebuke is to reprove
[1:29:03] to reprove is to expose with a view to
[1:29:09] correction
[1:29:11] trusting does not mean to punish
[1:29:15] it means to discipline because the
[1:29:17] subject amendment is in mind
[1:29:21] he wants you to readjust
[1:29:24] from the condition that you're in
[1:29:28] we're not talking about you backsliding
[1:29:31] but we're talking about you amending
[1:29:34] your ways
[1:29:35] for you to progress into the work
[1:29:39] you're not in Egypt you're not in the
[1:29:41] wilderness you're not on this side
[1:29:43] Jordan you already in the land but now
[1:29:47] the Lord has said watching this place
[1:29:49] here is exposing this thing so we become
[1:29:53] aware of it so we can cry out more into
[1:29:57] the spirit and know on how to advance
[1:30:03] this is exactly what what we find in
[1:30:05] Hebrews 12 5 11 and we have forgotten
[1:30:09] the exhortation which is packeth unto
[1:30:12] you as unto children my son despise not
[1:30:15] thou the chestning of the Lord no
[1:30:19] offense when a doubt are rebuked of him
[1:30:22] for whom the Lord will loveth he
[1:30:25] trustens encourages every son whom he
[1:30:29] receiveth
[1:30:30] if he enjoys chastening God dealing with
[1:30:34] you as with sons for what son is he whom
[1:30:38] the father just not
[1:30:41] but if ye be without trusting without
[1:30:45] your chastisement wherefore
[1:30:49] wait for all our particles then you are
[1:30:53] bastard not Sons
[1:30:56] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[1:30:59] flesh which corrected us and we and we
[1:31:02] give them reverence shall shall we not
[1:31:05] much rather be in subjection unto the
[1:31:08] father of spirits and live
[1:31:11] for they very very for a few days a
[1:31:15] trust in us after their own pleasure but
[1:31:18] he for our prophet
[1:31:21] for we might be part circus of his
[1:31:23] Holiness na would now not just think for
[1:31:26] the presence similar to be joyous but
[1:31:30] Grievous nevertheless afterward it will
[1:31:32] have the peaceful fruit of righteousness
[1:31:34] unto them which are exercised thereby
[1:31:39] it may seem like every time I go to
[1:31:42] church his horse always hard on us
[1:31:46] why can't I just have a little bit of
[1:31:48] extension yeah it's hard
[1:31:52] though it's not it's not joyful now why
[1:31:55] should I Monday to Sunday always have
[1:31:58] long said yes it is hard
[1:32:01] but if you harden your heart if your
[1:32:03] heart can receive that
[1:32:06] then you're a bastard
[1:32:08] then when you cross the line then the
[1:32:11] Lord starts watching you yeah you I
[1:32:13] think I can dress this yeah you can even
[1:32:15] have a dream yeah you see yourself like
[1:32:17] you know with a nice skirt just a just a
[1:32:21] little bit behind the knee
[1:32:24] yeah you have pictures right of the
[1:32:27] prophet's wife you have it
[1:32:30] you have it
[1:32:32] good reasons for you to do what you can
[1:32:35] do
[1:32:37] but the spirit says watch the vision
[1:32:41] on to what are you comparing to
[1:32:44] what is the Plumb line
[1:32:47] what are you embracing
[1:32:50] it's hard
[1:32:53] it's not joyful
[1:32:55] but to those that will embrace it when
[1:32:59] the product of it the fruit of it shall
[1:33:02] come
[1:33:03] then you look behind and say oh really
[1:33:06] yeah really
[1:33:09] I didn't think that all these years yes
[1:33:12] that's the result of it
[1:33:15] William Branham labored so much in the
[1:33:17] field
[1:33:18] you look at Aura Robert and Billy Graham
[1:33:22] and you see all the big buildings and
[1:33:24] all he said Lord can't you trust me with
[1:33:26] all this
[1:33:28] some of you do say to something
[1:33:32] Lord if you trust me I can have that
[1:33:35] skirt that left nothing will happen the
[1:33:37] Lord said put a longer one
[1:33:42] it's hard for the time present
[1:33:46] even the voice told him I am your
[1:33:48] project but that was not enough
[1:33:52] but until one morning do you want to see
[1:33:55] obviously under
[1:33:58] he steps out
[1:34:01] it's real
[1:34:04] for me to get here requires this path
[1:34:07] yes sir
[1:34:11] it's so division
[1:34:13] the bride walking
[1:34:16] there was a vision but until he stepped
[1:34:19] in there then he saw the sister coming
[1:34:21] dressed like in the vision
[1:34:25] different stages of the ministry
[1:34:31] you start like you know first pull
[1:34:32] obedience the second pull you do this
[1:34:34] third pool they reject you and all this
[1:34:37] yeah you have to go through that for
[1:34:40] this reception here
[1:34:44] Paul himself Jews of them at the
[1:34:47] Pharisees
[1:34:48] lose
[1:34:51] but then when he refined himself like
[1:34:53] you know all this is done
[1:34:56] until to the Corinthians he said I saw a
[1:35:00] man who step up there and so things that
[1:35:03] unlawful to speak to men
[1:35:07] it has been given to you the knowledge
[1:35:10] the understanding all these things
[1:35:13] so that at the end of The Journey you
[1:35:16] shall not say I did not know
[1:35:20] because those tapes and those messages
[1:35:22] will come out
[1:35:25] ring in your mind you had the
[1:35:28] opportunity
[1:35:30] look at how many people you've
[1:35:32] influenced
[1:35:34] oh brother I never slept with any other
[1:35:36] man but only my husband brother Branham
[1:35:39] says yes but by the way you dressed look
[1:35:42] how many people you've sent into hell
[1:35:45] the work of the ministry was it to send
[1:35:48] people into heaven or to send them into
[1:35:50] hell
[1:35:53] because the work that we do reflects who
[1:35:56] are we partaking of because the first
[1:35:59] guy in the heavens he did his ministry
[1:36:02] to bring Spirits down here
[1:36:05] and what are we doing directly and
[1:36:07] directly in our bedroom in our mind in
[1:36:10] everything else
[1:36:13] you see
[1:36:15] it's very hard to preach this kind of
[1:36:18] sermons
[1:36:20] it's hard
[1:36:22] when you get exposed they said Lord say
[1:36:25] go this way
[1:36:27] how how am I going to do it
[1:36:31] but you have to bring it out
[1:36:33] they have to come back in line they have
[1:36:36] to watch those places
[1:36:38] and yet it will take you a while of
[1:36:41] course
[1:36:42] for you to understand it
[1:36:44] but when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:36:46] and it starts showing you the impact of
[1:36:49] those things that you're wearing in the
[1:36:51] secrets and those things and those
[1:36:53] behaviors and things
[1:36:55] then you start being awakened
[1:36:58] we are surrounded by all these kind of
[1:37:00] demons I've been bringing all these
[1:37:03] demons in the church have been like you
[1:37:05] know all these weaker ones I did not pay
[1:37:07] attention to them I leave all type of
[1:37:10] lives out there and I come here and I
[1:37:11] see there's a signs and those spirits
[1:37:14] will be moving around and affecting
[1:37:16] these young ones and the weak ones
[1:37:19] only the spirit will be able to unveil
[1:37:23] those things
[1:37:26] because let's not be selfish
[1:37:29] let's be aware let be conscious and to
[1:37:33] be cautious through the holy spirit this
[1:37:36] holy spirit that unveils these things
[1:37:38] because even William Branham preached
[1:37:41] they say like you know the first cell is
[1:37:43] this but then when the Holy Spirit came
[1:37:45] you start opening a level
[1:37:48] that he did not see before
[1:37:51] the things that we may see they may be
[1:37:53] right to our own eyes the word said lean
[1:37:57] not to your own understanding
[1:38:00] shall we pray
[1:38:03] Heavenly Father
[1:38:05] surely lord it's uh
[1:38:09] hard unto amend
[1:38:12] to rebuke and to speak father
[1:38:15] but Lord you've shown us the Lord that
[1:38:18] to rebuke
[1:38:20] is not to
[1:38:22] punish
[1:38:24] but Lord an amendment is in view father
[1:38:29] to align us once again with our
[1:38:31] theophanese
[1:38:34] Almighty savior
[1:38:36] we're standing humbly before you Lord
[1:38:39] we do not know if tomorrow is ours
[1:38:43] this could be the last sermon William
[1:38:45] Bradham preached communion
[1:38:47] and that was it father
[1:38:50] we're standing here we don't know what
[1:38:52] will be the next few minutes
[1:38:55] it may be my last sermon
[1:38:59] you I did not see myself
[1:39:02] okay
[1:39:03] but father God
[1:39:05] your sons
[1:39:07] your daughters
[1:39:10] they seated here father
[1:39:12] not to hear men or how a man can preach
[1:39:15] father
[1:39:17] many father sermons have been preached
[1:39:19] much better way clearer way simpler way
[1:39:23] deep and things father
