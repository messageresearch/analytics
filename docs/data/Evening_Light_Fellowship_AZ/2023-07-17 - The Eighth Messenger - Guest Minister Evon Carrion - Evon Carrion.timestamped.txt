[53:06] [Music]
[53:34] your love in our lives oh God
[53:39] amen and while you're standing
[53:42] just turn in your Bible we'll read a
[53:44] verse scripture perhaps
[53:48] it will allow you to sit I think
[53:51] we should maybe go over to Exodus 23.
[53:55] and verse 20.
[53:58] just to get a startup point
[54:02] Exodus 23.
[54:07] and
[54:08] verse 20.
[54:14] behold
[54:17] I send an angel before thee
[54:21] keep thee in the way and to bring thee
[54:24] into the place which I have prepared
[54:27] now notice
[54:29] we know Moses was an angel he was a
[54:32] messenger
[54:33] and but God said he's going to send
[54:35] another messenger
[54:37] another angel
[54:39] keep Moses and to keep the people to
[54:41] bring them into the land
[54:43] beware of him and obey his voice provoke
[54:46] him not for we will not pardon your
[54:48] transgressions
[54:49] for my name is in him
[54:52] but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice
[54:54] and do all that I speak then I will be
[54:56] an aim an enemy unto thine enemies in an
[54:59] adversary unto thine adversaries for
[55:02] mine Angels shall go before thee and
[55:05] bring thee in unto the amorites and to
[55:08] the Hittites and the parasites and the
[55:11] Canaanites and the hibites and the
[55:12] jebusites and I will cut them off
[55:15] and another verse
[55:18] to kind of use something in a new
[55:19] testament
[55:21] to help us understand Exodus 23 let's go
[55:25] to First John and the fifth chapter
[55:30] and the 20th verse
[55:34] and we know that the Son of God is come
[55:38] and have given us an understanding that
[55:41] we may know him that is true and we are
[55:44] in him that is true
[55:45] even in his son Jesus Christ this is the
[55:48] true God and eternal life
[55:51] may God add His blessings to read him
[55:53] his word
[55:55] be seated may the Lord bless you all
[55:59] amen we want to ask
[56:01] thank for the Ron for the opportunity to
[56:03] speak to his congregation we come here
[56:05] we're sister Ruth he is Ruthie here and
[56:07] said brother Wes God bless you all
[56:10] brother Wallace God bless you
[56:13] um
[56:15] sister Ruth he had a baby the other day
[56:16] hey how long has it been six weeks or so
[56:19] and she said you got to come see your
[56:22] grandson
[56:23] so I feel like I needed to come to
[56:26] Arizona to see Ruthie's baby she
[56:29] come to the Lord in our church and
[56:31] married brother Wallace and I'll give
[56:33] brother
[56:34] brother Wes uh is that a is that a
[56:37] mustache or a beard you're wearing
[56:38] brother
[56:41] I got in my mind whenever I think about
[56:44] brother Wesley I think about him being a
[56:47] thief he stole my best musician
[56:50] and we're out of the Arizona
[56:52] amen we love them all with all of our
[56:55] hearts and
[56:56] I just want to maybe I've always told my
[56:59] my church my my wife whenever I come and
[57:02] I've only spoken here a couple times but
[57:04] when I when I preach here I feel like
[57:06] I'm preaching to my own church back in
[57:08] the Bronx you have the same atmosphere
[57:10] that we have over there so it must mean
[57:13] we're preaching the same thing
[57:16] different doctrines produce different
[57:19] atmospheres
[57:20] but brother Brandon said love has to
[57:22] control everything that's done in a
[57:24] congregation
[57:26] and so I know if we preach sound
[57:28] Doctrine it will produce the love of God
[57:30] in the church a loving atmosphere to be
[57:33] able to
[57:39] see all of our little church there in
[57:41] the Bronx
[57:42] we were persevering there now in August
[57:45] or September I think it is 25 years now
[57:48] I've been pastoring there in the Bronx
[57:49] we've survived it all somehow
[57:52] by the grace of God I'm originally from
[57:55] Ohio the Lord sent me there many years
[57:57] ago to start a little church and and
[57:59] then the Lord blessed it and just grew a
[58:02] little bit and
[58:04] he five years ago to pastor and I don't
[58:07] know how we've survived at all but we
[58:09] have by the grace of God and I'd like to
[58:14] say I love the Lord more today than I
[58:16] did 40 years ago when I give my heart to
[58:18] the Lord
[58:21] um I believe the revelation of the the
[58:23] message of the hour will bring us into
[58:26] the revelation of the word
[58:28] there's been so much emphasis on
[58:31] different uh topics certain subjects in
[58:34] the message of the hour and I feel that
[58:38] really the message came to bring us into
[58:40] the the depth of God's word
[58:42] and that's for rapturing faith will come
[58:45] from is the depths of God's word which
[58:48] is God's love extended to us right
[58:50] uh we we've had so many different uh
[58:56] uh I shall I say interpretations of the
[58:59] message over the years I've been in this
[59:01] long enough now that I've seen disciples
[59:03] uh
[59:04] repeat themselves three or four times
[59:07] now you know there's there's always 40
[59:09] years when I came about 38 years ago
[59:11] when I came there was uh popular
[59:13] ministers and in famous ministers and
[59:16] and then after a few years that that
[59:18] waned and another group came up and and
[59:21] then they that Wayne and another group
[59:23] came up and uh I was uh taught by an Old
[59:26] Saint something very important many
[59:29] years ago when I was just a young boy he
[59:32] told me he said brother Yvonne whenever
[59:33] you see a star arising in the message of
[59:36] the hour he said that's a sign that one
[59:39] day he's going to fall
[59:41] he said there's only one star that never
[59:44] moves and never Falls and that's Jesus
[59:46] Christ the North Star because you
[59:49] remember that don't you ever run it
[59:51] after a rising star you keep your eyes
[59:53] on Jesus Christ and you know that's kept
[59:56] me all these years he gave me something
[59:59] else that I think was very important in
[1:00:02] my life that especially as a pastor he
[1:00:05] taught me he said believe on when you
[1:00:07] listen to a preacheron we've learned
[1:00:10] over the years when we listen to a
[1:00:12] preacher we never listen to his words
[1:00:16] and what he told me is I said well
[1:00:18] brother how how was that when faith
[1:00:20] comes by hearing he said no brother he
[1:00:22] said you don't use your ear to hear you
[1:00:26] you use you
[1:00:27] your your ear to see
[1:00:30] and I said how's that he said while
[1:00:32] you're here but you're actually seeing
[1:00:34] because he's taking you somewhere
[1:00:37] there's an objective a goal that he's
[1:00:40] trying to retake you to he said now
[1:00:43] preachers use the message of the hour
[1:00:45] and the scriptures he said but not every
[1:00:47] preacher is going to take you to the
[1:00:50] right goal
[1:00:51] there's many that are making disciples
[1:00:53] to themselves their goal is to bring you
[1:00:56] to themselves he says so when you listen
[1:00:58] you see you see with your ear and you
[1:01:01] watch where he's taken you
[1:01:03] see and you know brother I thank God for
[1:01:06] that word of advice because it's kept me
[1:01:08] all these years I usually keep a
[1:01:10] scorecard when I hear a preacher
[1:01:12] preaching I keep a scorecard
[1:01:15] because there's there's uh topics in the
[1:01:18] messenger of the hour that deal with
[1:01:20] Redemption and uh brother Branham says
[1:01:23] that every Everybody born with a portion
[1:01:26] of faith in their pocket some with a
[1:01:28] nickel of Faith some with a dollar's
[1:01:30] worth of faith and you know you go you
[1:01:33] you have the faith that God's given you
[1:01:35] you
[1:01:37] that's just God's grace to your life now
[1:01:39] if you have a nickel you should invest
[1:01:41] it you'll get a dime you invest your
[1:01:43] faith in works right and so I I've
[1:01:46] learned that when we preach the Gospel
[1:01:49] of Jesus Christ when we preach the
[1:01:52] message of the hour every sermon has to
[1:01:54] have a value of redemption
[1:01:57] included in the sermon now if we preach
[1:02:01] uh the scriptures we preach the message
[1:02:03] but there's no value of redemption that
[1:02:07] it's just a vain sermon it's just a
[1:02:10] corporate uh uh speech that we're giving
[1:02:13] trying to draw people to something else
[1:02:15] but the gospel came for redemption's
[1:02:18] sake
[1:02:19] the message came to bring us into a
[1:02:21] revelation of that Redemption and so
[1:02:24] every sermon that we hear we've got to
[1:02:26] we've got to see a value of redemption
[1:02:29] in the sermon
[1:02:30] and I've watched all these different
[1:02:32] doctrines of the river risen over the
[1:02:34] years and I don't see any value of
[1:02:37] redemption in these different
[1:02:39] interpretations of the message the
[1:02:42] gospel cannot change it Remains the Same
[1:02:45] brother Burnham did not come to bring us
[1:02:48] to the revelation of himself or to the
[1:02:52] revelation of private Revelation
[1:02:54] interpretation but he brought us to the
[1:02:56] revelation of redemption through Jesus
[1:02:58] Christ Our Lord now it's old-fashioned
[1:03:02] but the old-time gospels the only one
[1:03:04] that can save you
[1:03:06] amen
[1:03:08] I didn't hear loud enough amen
[1:03:10] now listen Church uh Redemption comes
[1:03:14] with joy
[1:03:15] but see you can have joy and not have
[1:03:17] Redemption
[1:03:18] I've seen people run the aisles and and
[1:03:21] do all the things that Pentecostal
[1:03:23] people do it's become popular in the
[1:03:27] message of the hour to run for Jesus
[1:03:28] even
[1:03:30] right but that doesn't mean you're
[1:03:32] redeemed
[1:03:33] it doesn't mean you redeem Redemption
[1:03:35] comes through faith in the blood of
[1:03:38] Jesus Christ there's no other way
[1:03:40] that's God's provided way
[1:03:43] you know the absolute is is something
[1:03:46] that that has been discussed and argued
[1:03:49] over for years now in the message of the
[1:03:52] hour I when I came in that was an issue
[1:03:54] of what's the absolute and and some say
[1:03:58] it's the written word some say it's the
[1:03:59] message of the hour some say brother
[1:04:01] Bam's in absolute but when I study that
[1:04:04] that topic in the message of the hour I
[1:04:06] find that brother Branham actually tells
[1:04:08] us there's about six or seven different
[1:04:11] kinds of absolutes
[1:04:13] he says that the written word is an
[1:04:15] absolute he says an experience with the
[1:04:18] pillar fire becomes your absolute
[1:04:20] he said Moses went to Egypt with an
[1:04:23] absolute which was his Commission
[1:04:26] he says a vision is an absolute
[1:04:29] he says a dream is the same as a vision
[1:04:31] therefore a dream given to you by God is
[1:04:34] an absolute
[1:04:36] and he he teaches us also that the
[1:04:38] revelation of his message becomes an
[1:04:40] absolute to you
[1:04:42] so there's a Common Thread through all
[1:04:44] these absolutes which is the Holy Spirit
[1:04:48] whatever God does in your life in
[1:04:51] whatever form he does it becomes an
[1:04:53] absolute to you
[1:04:54] but it's not enough the absolute must
[1:04:57] mature in your life
[1:05:00] the maturing of the absolute you know
[1:05:03] the written word is an absolute how many
[1:05:04] can say Amen
[1:05:06] but the written word can't save you
[1:05:09] the Bible says a letter of the word is
[1:05:12] death to you see there must come a
[1:05:14] revelation of the written word it's got
[1:05:18] to mature
[1:05:19] the Baptists have the written word
[1:05:22] but the revelation of the word they're
[1:05:24] lacking in the revelation of the word so
[1:05:26] it must mature we've got the written
[1:05:29] word and many of us have a revelation of
[1:05:31] the written word but still that that
[1:05:34] Revelation also must mature because the
[1:05:37] revelation of the word must become the
[1:05:40] Living Word in your life
[1:05:42] you've got to become it's got to become
[1:05:44] the word in flesh in your life
[1:05:46] so I thank the Lord I prayed about that
[1:05:49] for for years I prayed and said Lord you
[1:05:51] know my wrong I put so much emphasis on
[1:05:54] the written word am I missing something
[1:05:56] in the message of the hour am I leaving
[1:05:59] that out but the lord gave me the answer
[1:06:01] in prayer it really it's a maturing
[1:06:04] process in our lives and and the goal is
[1:06:09] to bring you into a manifestation of the
[1:06:12] word now not with you you go back into
[1:06:14] the Book of Genesis and you'll see that
[1:06:17] that God spoke seven six times to create
[1:06:20] the world Amen Genesis the first chapter
[1:06:23] but but the Sabbath was in the second
[1:06:26] chapter when he said it's not good that
[1:06:28] a man be alone right but then Adam spoke
[1:06:34] and Adam said this is now bone of my
[1:06:36] bone and Flesh of My Flesh because she
[1:06:40] came from me with the word
[1:06:42] so the eighth voice
[1:06:44] was Adam speaking revealing the
[1:06:47] manifestation of the Bride
[1:06:49] and I want to title this message the
[1:06:52] eighth messenger and I I wrote it by
[1:06:55] your pastor before I I dared
[1:06:58] I said I want to cause you problems
[1:07:00] brother because it's a dangerous subject
[1:07:03] there's been so many different eighth
[1:07:06] Messengers
[1:07:07] I I you know I run into one in Peru
[1:07:09] years ago I run into one in India years
[1:07:12] ago everybody's got an eighth messenger
[1:07:14] but scripturally there is an eighth
[1:07:17] messenger
[1:07:18] amen and the eighth messenger is the
[1:07:21] revealer of redemption
[1:07:23] because you know brother Benham could
[1:07:25] not reveal Redemption to you he was the
[1:07:28] seventh passenger there's got to come
[1:07:30] one after him
[1:07:32] that takes you into the revelation of
[1:07:34] true Redemption
[1:07:36] I don't know if I said that last time I
[1:07:39] was here I I've used this I I like to
[1:07:42] use this of every once in a while God
[1:07:43] will give a minister something that that
[1:07:45] uh
[1:07:48] that might help everyone and years ago I
[1:07:52] was preaching in Mexico somewhere and I
[1:07:55] was preaching the real real uh humble
[1:07:57] people of poor Origins they weren't real
[1:08:01] rich and and so God gave me something to
[1:08:03] try to explain this to them very simple
[1:08:05] and I walked out to the end of the Pell
[1:08:07] platform and I said I'm standing here on
[1:08:11] the end above a diving board
[1:08:14] I said now now watch the diving board is
[1:08:16] built in a certain way there's a power
[1:08:19] in the diving board
[1:08:21] but the man that's on the end of the
[1:08:23] diving board has to know how to use that
[1:08:25] power
[1:08:26] and now there's a purpose for the
[1:08:28] building of that diving board and the
[1:08:31] purpose is to be able to project this
[1:08:33] man up into the heavenlies
[1:08:36] right
[1:08:38] and I said but the man that's on the
[1:08:40] diving board has to know how to take
[1:08:42] that step of faith
[1:08:44] and when I was a young man I was a
[1:08:46] really good diver
[1:08:47] and I I kind of want my wife over what
[1:08:50] diving she was watching me dive and I
[1:08:52] kind of seduced her with my diving
[1:08:58] I could do the flips and all that stuff
[1:09:00] you know and I learned how to hit that
[1:09:03] just right
[1:09:04] so so the minister has to know how to
[1:09:07] hit that that board just right now the
[1:09:10] diving board is the messenger of the
[1:09:11] hour
[1:09:12] now that's the inspiration that takes a
[1:09:15] man up into Heavenly places
[1:09:17] now notice the purpose of the diving
[1:09:20] board is not just to take you up into
[1:09:21] Heavenly places
[1:09:23] but it's also humble you and take you
[1:09:26] down into the depths of the water
[1:09:28] now we have lots that get up way up in
[1:09:31] the Heavenly places and may you stay
[1:09:33] there
[1:09:34] up in Heavenly places
[1:09:36] we have some that don't know how to use
[1:09:38] the diving board
[1:09:40] some they get up there and they want to
[1:09:42] stay up there
[1:09:43] you know I've had them in my church they
[1:09:45] walk around with a a tape recorder in
[1:09:48] your pocket listening to the message
[1:09:49] while they're in the subway out loud
[1:09:51] thinking that somehow that's going to
[1:09:53] produce rapturing faith
[1:09:55] super religious people that never humble
[1:09:58] themselves
[1:10:00] because if God ever reveals a message to
[1:10:02] you it will bring you down
[1:10:04] it will humble you
[1:10:09] you know I've come to the place where
[1:10:11] there's I realize there's nothing I like
[1:10:13] about myself
[1:10:16] I I and I say that sincerely I hate the
[1:10:19] fact that I lost my hair
[1:10:22] you know I I don't like the way I dress
[1:10:24] I dress this week as my wife dresses me
[1:10:26] this way
[1:10:28] you know I I don't I can't see myself
[1:10:30] preach because I don't like the way I
[1:10:32] preach
[1:10:33] there's just nothing I like about myself
[1:10:35] and you know why it's because I love the
[1:10:37] Lord the more I see him the less I like
[1:10:39] myself
[1:10:41] see so so the minister must get up into
[1:10:44] Heavenly places and then he must go down
[1:10:46] deep into the depths of God's word
[1:10:50] the purpose of the message
[1:10:54] we got too many to get out on the diving
[1:10:56] board and they say brother banham came
[1:10:58] brother banham came brother Venom came
[1:11:00] but it never go anywhere
[1:11:03] but never take the people to the depth
[1:11:05] of the word
[1:11:08] and if you don't take the people into
[1:11:09] the depth of the word there will be no
[1:11:12] Rapture in faith in the church
[1:11:15] rapturing faith comes from the word of
[1:11:17] God
[1:11:19] now I'm going to try
[1:11:23] to explain to you uh you know I I've
[1:11:27] learned that A good sermon doesn't come
[1:11:29] because you study a lot
[1:11:31] uh I think it was uh Spurgeon or maybe
[1:11:34] maybe it was purging that said this he
[1:11:37] said oh is John Wesley I think it was he
[1:11:40] said I'd rather pray three hours and
[1:11:43] study one hour than to study three hours
[1:11:46] and pray one hour
[1:11:48] so uh
[1:11:49] best sermons I've ever ever preached in
[1:11:52] my life we one where I I got a thought
[1:11:55] from God while I was praying
[1:11:58] see not yo I've had about every
[1:12:01] experience a Christian can have I I've
[1:12:04] run the aisles for the Lord the Lord has
[1:12:07] touched my touched me with anointed made
[1:12:10] me run and I've I've spun around in
[1:12:12] circles and I've I've done backflips in
[1:12:14] church
[1:12:16] I've done all those things
[1:12:19] I wasn't
[1:12:21] in the front row of my church one day
[1:12:22] and the ministry was preaching and he
[1:12:24] said something and and the power of God
[1:12:26] come into church I was the first one out
[1:12:28] of my seat
[1:12:30] you know sometimes I'm afraid to even
[1:12:33] say these things because people want to
[1:12:34] imitate you have an experience and
[1:12:36] people want to imitate it right
[1:12:39] but I'll share this with you I I jumped
[1:12:42] out of my chair and I raised up like
[1:12:43] that and right here
[1:12:45] there was another atmosphere and when I
[1:12:48] took my hands through that atmosphere I
[1:12:51] felt 600 volts going through my body
[1:12:54] and I was just shaking and shaking and I
[1:12:57] and I was conscious that it was right
[1:12:58] here
[1:13:00] I entered into another dimension
[1:13:03] right so I lowered my hands down and I
[1:13:05] stopped shaking I said now Lord if that
[1:13:07] was you let it be there again
[1:13:10] and I raised my hand up and just as I
[1:13:13] touched it I felt that electricity going
[1:13:15] through my body again
[1:13:16] now this is going on in church and
[1:13:19] everybody's watching the pastor
[1:13:21] being real Pentecostal
[1:13:24] and I'm conscious of that because I
[1:13:26] don't want people imitating me
[1:13:28] let them have their own experience
[1:13:32] sometimes we we get so reserved
[1:13:35] that pastors you know they just get so
[1:13:38] reserved they're afraid of these
[1:13:40] Supernatural things they don't they
[1:13:42] don't know what to do with them but you
[1:13:44] know when that happened the second time
[1:13:45] and I said Lord not only my fingertips
[1:13:47] my whole body
[1:13:49] and I just jumped up into it the power
[1:13:51] of God struck me right here
[1:13:54] and I flipped and landed in the Pew
[1:13:56] behind me
[1:13:58] now my wife's sitting right here she'll
[1:14:00] tell you she was sitting right next to
[1:14:01] me when it happened and it was genuine
[1:14:04] Holy Spirit
[1:14:06] you know what I found out the next day I
[1:14:08] was the same person
[1:14:10] it didn't change me in any way
[1:14:15] I've run the aisles I spoke in tongues
[1:14:17] I've done all those things
[1:14:19] but those things don't change your soul
[1:14:21] they're a blessing we thank God for them
[1:14:24] I think they're they're part of a
[1:14:26] Christian experience
[1:14:29] but what brought me to Christ was the
[1:14:31] greatest Revelation you know what it is
[1:14:34] that I was a sinner
[1:14:37] you know people think that the
[1:14:39] revelation of Jesus Christ is the
[1:14:41] greatest Revelation it really is not
[1:14:44] the greatest Revelation is that you're a
[1:14:46] sinner
[1:14:47] and when you God reveals to you that
[1:14:50] you're a sinner then you start searching
[1:14:52] for a savior now God can reveal Christ
[1:14:54] to you
[1:14:57] the greatest things that have happened
[1:14:59] to me that have changed my life happened
[1:15:01] to me when I was praying
[1:15:03] in my bedroom by myself
[1:15:07] just weeping before the Lord and humbly
[1:15:09] myself and say Lord I I need more of you
[1:15:12] I I love you Lord I and Lord I'm just
[1:15:15] worthless in this condition you got to
[1:15:17] do something to change my life and
[1:15:19] that's when God Has Come to Me
[1:15:22] you know how God revealed this message
[1:15:24] to me
[1:15:25] I was praying and maybe a year and a
[1:15:27] half after I started attending
[1:15:29] quote-unquote a message church and
[1:15:32] everybody was telling me God sent a
[1:15:34] prophet and you know I was afraid of a
[1:15:36] prophet I didn't want that I wanted
[1:15:37] Christ
[1:15:38] I didn't want nothing else
[1:15:40] but I was praying after about a year and
[1:15:42] a half and I said Lord when I sit down
[1:15:45] with my tape recorder or my my tape
[1:15:47] could set player and I listened to this
[1:15:49] man he makes me weep
[1:15:52] and I can't stop crying
[1:15:54] and I sit there with my Bible opening
[1:15:56] listen to this man's voice and he's he's
[1:15:59] making me weep and cry and Lord here I
[1:16:02] am on my knees praying and I said I'm
[1:16:04] talking to you but the outward man is
[1:16:06] weeping and crying and I can't stop it
[1:16:09] what is it about this man's voice
[1:16:12] that affects me this way I can hear all
[1:16:15] the other preachers of the world and it
[1:16:17] doesn't affect me that way what is it
[1:16:19] about this man's voice that's different
[1:16:22] and down in the bottom of my soul the
[1:16:24] Holy Spirit spoke to me you know what he
[1:16:26] said it's not his voice it's mine
[1:16:31] and that's when I understood who brother
[1:16:34] Branham was he was the voice of God for
[1:16:36] this age it wasn't the voice of these so
[1:16:40] our Acer the man it was the voice of
[1:16:43] these sort of man
[1:16:45] that's why it was affecting me that way
[1:16:50] the brother and sister we've got to come
[1:16:52] back
[1:16:53] you've got to come back to that original
[1:16:54] fate based on Revelation
[1:16:57] Redemption is a revelation
[1:17:00] Revelations 10 10 1 now all of you know
[1:17:03] the message of the hour you're well
[1:17:05] taught here it is the Angel of the Lord
[1:17:07] the angel the Covenant coming down to
[1:17:10] claim his possession right
[1:17:12] he's got the book of redemption in his
[1:17:15] hand and you know you can't place a date
[1:17:18] on that
[1:17:20] there's been so much arguing about when
[1:17:23] it happened in 1963 or when it happened
[1:17:26] it's an eternal Redemption
[1:17:29] see it's symbolic of Eternal Redemption
[1:17:33] I asked the minister one time in Africa
[1:17:35] he was arguing this point with me I said
[1:17:37] brother when were you saved he said 1972
[1:17:40] I said no brother you were saved before
[1:17:43] the foundation of the world
[1:17:45] you just come to a revelation of it in
[1:17:48] 1972.
[1:17:50] see the angel the Covenant is the only
[1:17:52] one that can reveal Redemption to the
[1:17:54] individual
[1:17:57] so we see that in Exodus 23
[1:18:00] God sends another angel
[1:18:03] and let me let me just
[1:18:06] go back to my notes and maybe start
[1:18:08] preaching to you now
[1:18:10] now
[1:18:15] my my desire was it was an Apostolic man
[1:18:18] that came to my church and he started
[1:18:20] attending and and he was very very uh
[1:18:24] uh much afraid of this message and uh so
[1:18:28] I prayed and I said Lord would you just
[1:18:30] give me a sermon that's scriptural I can
[1:18:34] teach him that this message is thus said
[1:18:37] the lord it's in the scripture
[1:18:39] I said give me something Lord I need
[1:18:41] something in the scripture that will
[1:18:43] help him understand this message
[1:18:45] and so the lord gave me this message and
[1:18:48] we've preached it now to be able to
[1:18:51] confirm and establish that the end time
[1:18:54] message is a bible-based fact
[1:18:57] that has brought us to a promise from
[1:19:00] God for the intention of a complete
[1:19:03] restoration of the Gospel of Jesus
[1:19:05] Christ
[1:19:07] we're not we're not preaching the sermon
[1:19:10] uh with uh the intention of exalting
[1:19:13] ourselves or anyone else
[1:19:15] we want to exalt Christ and Christ alone
[1:19:18] it's God's Redemptive work
[1:19:22] God that's given us this wonderful
[1:19:24] gospel
[1:19:25] it's God that's restored us back to the
[1:19:27] original faith
[1:19:29] notice the word was never restored
[1:19:32] it's our faith that must be restored in
[1:19:36] the word
[1:19:37] God the word is God
[1:19:41] never backslides he doesn't need
[1:19:43] resurrect it's our faith that needs
[1:19:46] restoration
[1:19:49] so God wants to restore us back to our
[1:19:52] original positions
[1:19:53] and there is an eternal truth
[1:19:56] that is an encouragement to me
[1:19:58] personally
[1:19:59] that man's fall is not greater than
[1:20:03] God's love
[1:20:05] I don't care how far you've gone God's
[1:20:08] love is greater than your fault
[1:20:12] and your fall man's fault obligates
[1:20:15] God's love to manifest itself as the
[1:20:19] grace of God
[1:20:20] and there's a thought a hidden thought
[1:20:23] in the heart of God
[1:20:24] that's on display in humanity
[1:20:29] and it that comes into display when we
[1:20:32] have a need
[1:20:34] his reaction to our knee is to supply
[1:20:38] away
[1:20:40] to supply our needs
[1:20:45] oh I'm so thankful that he made a way
[1:20:47] for me
[1:20:50] so we see that this message came it's
[1:20:54] God's way of supplying our need to
[1:20:56] overcome this Dark Age we live in
[1:21:00] now
[1:21:06] we know that whatever God does he does
[1:21:09] it the same over and over again
[1:21:13] the title is the eighth messenger but
[1:21:15] the subject is cyclical Redemption
[1:21:19] Redemption comes in Cycles
[1:21:22] and the cycle never changes
[1:21:25] whenever God redeems you always redeems
[1:21:27] the same way
[1:21:29] he doesn't have to change his way of
[1:21:31] redemption
[1:21:33] somehow or another
[1:21:35] I hope this isn't
[1:21:38] wrong I I don't want you to under
[1:21:40] misunderstand me but I I do not believe
[1:21:43] that that you can be redeemed solely by
[1:21:47] a message book
[1:21:48] it comes by a revelation of the blood of
[1:21:51] Jesus Christ
[1:21:53] when Christ was hanging on the cross he
[1:21:55] did not bleed ink
[1:21:58] he bled blood
[1:22:03] I know the devil doesn't like that but
[1:22:04] that's the truth
[1:22:06] see it was suffering that paid the price
[1:22:10] of our Redemption he was blocked and
[1:22:13] it's a revelation of that blood that
[1:22:16] that saves a man and brings him into
[1:22:18] Redemption
[1:22:19] now the the fall of Man
[1:22:24] introduced God's provided way which was
[1:22:27] the death of an innocent
[1:22:29] and we already said that there were six
[1:22:31] voices that God used for the creation
[1:22:34] the seventh voice came in Chapter 2 and
[1:22:38] the eighth voice was Adam himself
[1:22:40] declaring the manifestation of his bride
[1:22:44] and then they fell into sin and God
[1:22:47] revealed his way of redemption which was
[1:22:50] the death of an innocent one that sets
[1:22:53] the pattern for the entire Bible
[1:22:56] Hallelujah
[1:22:58] theologians call it the identic
[1:23:01] dispensation the dispensation of Eden
[1:23:05] but after the dispensation of Eden the
[1:23:09] Bible is essentially made up of three
[1:23:11] dispensations
[1:23:13] Patriarchs dispensation
[1:23:15] the dispensation of the law of Moses and
[1:23:19] the dispensation of Grace
[1:23:21] in every dispensation in every cycle of
[1:23:26] dispensation there's also a cycle of
[1:23:28] redemption
[1:23:29] and that cycle never changes
[1:23:32] praise the Lord
[1:23:34] Hallelujah now
[1:23:39] let me show you
[1:23:42] I I believe God is showing us these
[1:23:45] things because he wants us to to have
[1:23:48] our hearts completely filled with faith
[1:23:52] in his word
[1:23:53] now
[1:23:54] in in that the first dispensation the
[1:23:59] dispensation of the patriarch God
[1:24:01] actually had seven voices
[1:24:04] in those seven in that first
[1:24:07] dispensation of the Patriarchs the first
[1:24:09] voice was Enoch the second voice was
[1:24:12] Noah the third voice was Abraham the
[1:24:16] fourth voice was Isaac the fifth voice
[1:24:19] was Jacob the sixth voice was Joseph and
[1:24:23] the seventh voice was Moses which was a
[1:24:27] restoration prophet
[1:24:29] and what did he do he introduced or
[1:24:32] reintroduced the original lamb
[1:24:35] at Passover
[1:24:38] but that could not
[1:24:40] bring them across the promised land and
[1:24:43] into the promised land because we know
[1:24:45] Redemption is twofold brother random
[1:24:48] said
[1:24:49] it's going it's coming out and going in
[1:24:53] and the restoration Prophet has to
[1:24:56] manifest that are coming out and going
[1:24:59] in
[1:25:01] Moses brought them out but Moses could
[1:25:04] not take them in
[1:25:06] there was a need for innate messenger
[1:25:09] and the eighth messenger is the one that
[1:25:12] took them into the Promised Land
[1:25:15] which is the holy spirit himself the
[1:25:18] messenger the Covenant revealed as the
[1:25:21] pillar fire I want to just stop and
[1:25:23] think about that a little bit
[1:25:25] do you know why the Red Sea opened up
[1:25:29] because the eighth messenger came to
[1:25:32] defend the blood of the Covenant
[1:25:35] Pharaoh could not destroy the Redemptive
[1:25:38] work that God was doing
[1:25:40] and the Red Sea could not be a hindrance
[1:25:44] the pillar fire had to come and confirm
[1:25:47] the blood of the Covenant
[1:25:49] what was it that took Israel across the
[1:25:52] promised land what was it that provided
[1:25:55] the manner and the water from the rock
[1:25:58] it was the pillar of fire confirming the
[1:26:01] blood of the Covenant I want you to know
[1:26:04] that if you take part in this Redemptive
[1:26:07] cycle
[1:26:08] there's got to be an eight Covenant
[1:26:10] eighth messenger in your life that's
[1:26:13] going to guarantee your passage into the
[1:26:15] Promised Land
[1:26:17] Hallelujah that's why the pillar fire
[1:26:21] disappeared once they cross over into
[1:26:24] the promised land the pillar fire had
[1:26:27] fulfilled its purpose of complacon
[1:26:31] fulfilling the promise that God gave the
[1:26:33] people
[1:26:37] anything that came against that promise
[1:26:41] the angel of the Covenant was there
[1:26:44] to protect and and fulfill and confirm
[1:26:47] the promise that God had given to people
[1:26:50] now if you study the scriptures
[1:26:54] you'll see that the pillar of fire
[1:26:56] reveals the power of the blood of the
[1:26:59] Lamb
[1:27:00] Hallelujah you have no power in your
[1:27:04] life until the the faith or the
[1:27:06] Revelation in the blood becomes a
[1:27:10] reality to you and that's when the
[1:27:12] pillar of fire comes into your life
[1:27:14] taking it back to the the The Upper Room
[1:27:18] in Acts the second chapter what the
[1:27:21] pillar of fire did did was come in and
[1:27:23] confirm the promise that Christ had
[1:27:26] given to people
[1:27:27] we've got to get back to the original
[1:27:30] Pentecostal faith and we can't do it
[1:27:33] unless we preach the blood of Jesus
[1:27:36] Christ
[1:27:36] it's God's provided way
[1:27:39] oh it becomes so unpopular to preach the
[1:27:42] blood of Jesus Christ but the Bible
[1:27:45] teaches me praise the Lord
[1:27:48] it's the power of God unto salvation if
[1:27:52] you want power in the church you've got
[1:27:55] to preach the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:27:57] there's no other way to bring power into
[1:28:01] a church
[1:28:02] but the preaching of the Cross is what
[1:28:05] brings the power of God into a church
[1:28:07] brother bam said you can't get the
[1:28:10] Pentecost unless you come through
[1:28:12] Calvary
[1:28:13] Hallelujah
[1:28:16] the problem is the people that want to
[1:28:18] pay the price
[1:28:20] because there's also a mystery in the
[1:28:23] preaching of the cross the
[1:28:25] denominational curse is that they preach
[1:28:28] Christ crucified but they never say the
[1:28:31] bride must be crucified
[1:28:34] they never teach you that you've got to
[1:28:36] be dying his likeness
[1:28:39] you've got a rot Hallelujah before you
[1:28:42] can ever be raised again in the likeness
[1:28:44] of Christ
[1:28:45] that's really the denominational curse
[1:28:48] they preached the Cross of Christ but
[1:28:51] they Don't Preach your cross
[1:28:53] do you know the Rich Young Ruler
[1:28:56] he he had a pretty good religion and
[1:28:59] Jesus quoted five Commandments to him
[1:29:02] and every one of those Commandments
[1:29:05] dealt with his relationship with him and
[1:29:08] other parts of humanity
[1:29:12] but Jesus said well if you want to have
[1:29:14] a good relationship with the father
[1:29:15] you've got to sell all you have
[1:29:18] and distribute to the poor take up your
[1:29:20] cross and follow me
[1:29:23] and the Bible says he became very sad
[1:29:25] because he had much riches and much
[1:29:27] lands much possessions Amen in other
[1:29:30] words it's religion the religion he was
[1:29:33] practicing didn't touch his pocketbook
[1:29:41] he was in a religion of appearances
[1:29:44] he appeared to be righteous
[1:29:46] but a surrendered heart
[1:29:49] to almighty God
[1:29:51] we're going to cost them something
[1:29:56] oh you I can't it's it's difficult for
[1:30:00] me to preach this in New York City
[1:30:01] because the rents are high
[1:30:03] cost of living is really high in New
[1:30:05] York City
[1:30:06] see but if you follow that Mark the 10th
[1:30:09] chapter the next verse he says nobody
[1:30:12] can enter into the kingdom of God unless
[1:30:14] they become like one of these little
[1:30:16] children
[1:30:17] in other words depended on the father
[1:30:21] and that's the evil of that kind of
[1:30:23] religion see you you depend on your
[1:30:26] money to save you instead of Christ
[1:30:28] saving you
[1:30:31] see the Bible says he was very sad and
[1:30:34] he walked away and brother Branham
[1:30:36] actually said he turned away from
[1:30:38] salvation
[1:30:39] why because it was going to cost them
[1:30:41] something
[1:30:43] oh
[1:30:45] maybe maybe I should preach hezekiah's
[1:30:48] Revival
[1:30:50] brother Ron you ever studied job
[1:30:51] hezekiah's Revival go back and study
[1:30:54] your church
[1:30:55] over in the book of Kings you'll find
[1:30:56] out it Hezekiah the first thing he did
[1:30:59] was cleanse the ministry
[1:31:01] and then the second thing he did was
[1:31:03] cleanse the altar
[1:31:05] that he cleansed the temple then he went
[1:31:07] out and cleansed the people
[1:31:09] and the last thing he did the seventh
[1:31:12] step was He restored a tithing Covenant
[1:31:17] strange that hezekiah's Revival actually
[1:31:20] finished with the restoration of of
[1:31:24] tithings in the church
[1:31:26] I thought well why why that way well it
[1:31:29] was simple because they were unclean
[1:31:32] he had to cleanse the ministry first
[1:31:34] because the unclean Ministry can't clean
[1:31:37] the altar of a man's heart
[1:31:41] an unclean Ministry can't cleanse the
[1:31:43] temple can't cleanse the temple
[1:31:46] or the people
[1:31:48] but once you get the people all cleaned
[1:31:50] up
[1:31:51] now you can preach tithing to them
[1:31:55] and restore the Covenant of tithing
[1:31:58] to the people
[1:32:01] you know I
[1:32:02] was thinking about preaching that
[1:32:03] actually but the Lord changed my mind I
[1:32:07] don't think we have that problem here
[1:32:08] maybe somebody out there on the internet
[1:32:10] has that problem
[1:32:13] but if you don't give your tithing is it
[1:32:15] because you're unclean
[1:32:18] and go back and study the scriptures
[1:32:21] or bring you into a revelation of what
[1:32:23] you really
[1:32:25] are you got an unclean heart
[1:32:27] you haven't surrendered yourself you're
[1:32:29] like the Rich Young Ruler you still have
[1:32:31] the root of all evil in your heart the
[1:32:34] Love of Money
[1:32:42] she's kind of thinking to you but that's
[1:32:45] the way I preach at my church you know I
[1:32:47] got to preach it this way in New York
[1:32:49] City brother
[1:32:51] I have to preach it this way
[1:32:54] yeah you know I I I'm so thankful
[1:32:57] I'm so thankful that the Lord revealed
[1:33:00] to me when I went to New York City that
[1:33:02] I didn't have to depend on the people
[1:33:04] for my support
[1:33:06] see I don't have to worry about that
[1:33:08] there's 20 message churches in New York
[1:33:11] City choose wherever you want to go it
[1:33:13] don't matter
[1:33:14] but here we're going to teach you the
[1:33:16] right thing
[1:33:17] Let's see we will understand that you'll
[1:33:20] never understand the gospel until the
[1:33:24] Son of God comes into your life
[1:33:27] see the Son of God has given us
[1:33:29] understanding
[1:33:31] and the Son of God is another term for
[1:33:34] the Holy Spirit
[1:33:36] notice John didn't say the son of man
[1:33:38] has given us understanding he said the
[1:33:41] Son of God has given us understanding
[1:33:44] Moses was the seventh but the eighth was
[1:33:48] the pillar fire himself
[1:33:50] and he came to reveal the power that was
[1:33:53] in that blood
[1:33:55] now we go on to the next dispensation
[1:33:58] and we find out that it's the
[1:34:00] dispensation of Moses
[1:34:04] dispensation of Moses we find there's
[1:34:07] seven Messengers major Messengers that
[1:34:11] God sent to Israel during the time of
[1:34:14] this dispensation the pattern the cycle
[1:34:17] of redemption repeats itself
[1:34:20] starts with Samuel
[1:34:22] and the reason we start with Samuel is
[1:34:24] because Israel had fallen into idolatry
[1:34:27] in judges the 17th chapter
[1:34:31] Joshua took him into the Promised Land
[1:34:34] judges begins with the first and second
[1:34:36] chapter and then chapter 17 actually
[1:34:40] belongs historically between chapter 2
[1:34:43] and 3.
[1:34:45] Michael oh boy isn't that something
[1:34:48] Michael deciser have a house Church
[1:34:53] the ark was in Shiloh
[1:34:57] but he set up an eye on his house and he
[1:35:00] hired a levite to become his priest
[1:35:03] that was the beginning of idolatry in
[1:35:05] Israel
[1:35:08] a house Church
[1:35:10] you see how the Cycles repeat themselves
[1:35:13] the age we're living in
[1:35:17] it it's an indication of a fall from the
[1:35:20] grace of God
[1:35:22] because God said you've got to come to
[1:35:24] my altar Redemption Comes This Way
[1:35:28] it doesn't come any other way
[1:35:32] let me get off that subject
[1:35:34] starts with Samuel then we have Elijah
[1:35:37] we have Isaiah we have Jeremiah
[1:35:41] we have Ezekiel we have Daniel and then
[1:35:44] we have John the Baptist as the seventh
[1:35:47] voice
[1:35:48] and once again he is a restoration
[1:35:50] prophet
[1:35:51] just as Moses left he come out
[1:35:56] and he took the people in we find John
[1:35:59] the Baptist comes out from the Pharaoh
[1:36:02] the religion of the Pharisees and the
[1:36:04] Sadducees
[1:36:06] he comes out of the Jewish religion he's
[1:36:08] the restoration prophet and he
[1:36:10] introduces the original Land once again
[1:36:15] the restoration Prophet always says
[1:36:19] Behold the Lamb of God
[1:36:22] oh Hallelujah
[1:36:25] but it's not enough
[1:36:27] the messenger of the Covenant had to
[1:36:30] come
[1:36:31] reveal this Pillar of Fire at Pentecost
[1:36:35] and that messenger reveals the power
[1:36:38] that's in the blood of the Lamb
[1:36:40] and he is the protector of the Covenant
[1:36:44] when you see a man backslide and leave
[1:36:48] the message of the hour it's because the
[1:36:50] eighth messenger was never in his life
[1:36:55] the eighth messenger confirms the
[1:36:58] message of the seventh messenger
[1:37:00] Hallelujah and reveals the power of the
[1:37:03] blood
[1:37:05] to the individual
[1:37:07] we are of the opinion that we cannot
[1:37:11] preach this message unless God reveals
[1:37:13] it to us the same way he revealed it to
[1:37:16] the prophet
[1:37:17] we're not here as parents
[1:37:20] repeating what the prophet said
[1:37:22] but we have to be Eagles
[1:37:25] and get up high in the Heavenly places
[1:37:27] and receive it directly from God the
[1:37:30] same way brother Branham received it
[1:37:32] from God
[1:37:34] amen a preacher preaches what God
[1:37:37] reveals to him
[1:37:38] on a personal basis we're not here to
[1:37:42] repeat what other people say
[1:37:44] we know that that message that diving
[1:37:46] board is the inspiration
[1:37:49] and the things we see we would not be
[1:37:52] able to see without the inspiration of
[1:37:54] this message in our life
[1:37:57] it takes us up into Heavenly places in
[1:37:59] Christ and reveals the word of God to us
[1:38:02] and it produces the faith that's
[1:38:04] unfailing
[1:38:06] I don't care what the circumstances are
[1:38:10] God has made you an overcomer
[1:38:13] Hallelujah
[1:38:14] every age had a promise to the overcomer
[1:38:19] and every age has a bride that overcomes
[1:38:24] Spirit that's working in her age
[1:38:27] the Antichrist Spirit changes forms
[1:38:30] and produces
[1:38:32] a bachelor in church
[1:38:34] but the brother Christ is able to
[1:38:36] overcome because Revelation says because
[1:38:40] of the blood of Jesus Christ the blood
[1:38:43] of the lamb and the word of her
[1:38:44] testimony and they love not their lives
[1:38:46] unto death
[1:38:48] overcoming power only comes one way
[1:38:52] through the original Gospel of Jesus
[1:38:54] Christ
[1:38:56] once again
[1:38:58] that dispensation
[1:39:00] starts with a prophet ends with a
[1:39:04] prophet a restoration prophet and of
[1:39:07] course we know under Grace Covenant
[1:39:09] dispensation there's been seven
[1:39:12] Messengers that have come
[1:39:13] we'll repeat them to you although you'll
[1:39:16] probably know better than me Paul and
[1:39:19] iranius and Martin and Columba and
[1:39:21] Luther and John Wesley and Elijah's
[1:39:24] Spirit William Branham has a restoration
[1:39:26] prophet and what his message is he
[1:39:29] re-introduced the Lamb of God the
[1:39:32] original lamb
[1:39:33] that's why Revelations the fifth chapter
[1:39:36] is the introduction into the seals
[1:39:39] because without a revelation of that
[1:39:42] lamb that John saw there is no
[1:39:45] revelation of the Seven Seals in your
[1:39:48] life
[1:39:49] the messenger the Covenant revealed as
[1:39:52] the pillar of fire in this age this is
[1:39:55] why the pillar fire had to appear over
[1:39:59] the prophet's head as the witness of the
[1:40:02] eighth messenger
[1:40:03] Hallelujah that picture was no
[1:40:06] coincidence it was God revealing the
[1:40:09] eighth messenger that was present in the
[1:40:12] seven Messengers life
[1:40:14] Hallelujah it still has to be present in
[1:40:17] our churches the eighth messenger must
[1:40:20] be present in our congregations because
[1:40:23] he is a revelation he is a revelation
[1:40:26] and he is the revealer
[1:40:28] of the blood of Jesus Christ it's a
[1:40:31] return to the Pentecostal message
[1:40:34] it's a return to the Lamb of God
[1:40:38] brother Benham tells us in the invasion
[1:40:41] of the United States He said I'd like to
[1:40:43] show how the seven Church ages typed out
[1:40:46] in the Old Testament
[1:40:48] how they began just exactly like at the
[1:40:51] beginning of the church ages of the
[1:40:53] Gentile Church and went right down
[1:40:55] through a similar Dark Age and come out
[1:40:58] into the Glorious time of Pentecost at
[1:41:01] the falling of the holy spirit in the
[1:41:03] early church then going through another
[1:41:06] period of the idential church in other
[1:41:10] words another cycle
[1:41:11] of redemption
[1:41:13] Israel fell into idolatry and God re
[1:41:17] redeemed Israel
[1:41:20] true Israel was redeemed at Pentecost it
[1:41:24] was a cycle of redemption and that cycle
[1:41:27] is repeated itself in our last day in
[1:41:31] this continuous revelation of God's
[1:41:34] Redemptive work
[1:41:37] we see that God in every dispensation
[1:41:40] exhibits displays his work of
[1:41:44] restoration in the same way
[1:41:46] in every dispensation there are seven
[1:41:49] Messengers
[1:41:50] that culminate in a restoration listen
[1:41:53] to this church it's a restoration that
[1:41:56] reveals the very heart of almighty God
[1:42:00] the heart filled with thoughts of rubber
[1:42:04] of redemption
[1:42:06] it's a worship God produces Worship in a
[1:42:10] church in a church that doesn't worship
[1:42:13] has no revelation of redemption
[1:42:16] the Bible says the living they Worship
[1:42:19] the Lord they praised God but the dead
[1:42:22] prays not the Lord
[1:42:25] we're a people in a revelation
[1:42:27] of what Redemption is all about
[1:42:30] we see it all through the scriptures
[1:42:33] God's Abiding Love in Cycles redeeming
[1:42:37] his people always the same way
[1:42:43] recently I was preaching in my church
[1:42:45] and I said I know
[1:42:47] I know I'm in the on the right track
[1:42:49] because we're exalting the Lamb of God
[1:42:52] we're lifting him up
[1:42:57] and people are coming to Christ
[1:43:00] Hallelujah
[1:43:01] the message is intended to do that very
[1:43:05] thing to bring us into a revelation of
[1:43:08] the love of God
[1:43:10] 's love to The Sinner who hated God
[1:43:15] I hated God
[1:43:17] but God loved me
[1:43:19] and all my ignorance God loved me and he
[1:43:23] sent that eighth messenger into my life
[1:43:27] through a work called Calvary
[1:43:30] not only Jesus dying on the cross
[1:43:34] but we're coming to a place
[1:43:36] of surrender
[1:43:39] I'm gonna I'm gonna give this little
[1:43:42] testimony for the young people in the
[1:43:44] church
[1:43:46] we we have your people in this struggle
[1:43:49] in their life the raising the message
[1:43:51] and and they're taught to give all the
[1:43:54] right answers
[1:43:56] I was speaking to a young man recently
[1:43:59] and he's being very respectful I took
[1:44:01] him out for a steak dinner
[1:44:03] and he was being very respectful and I
[1:44:05] said brother you're in the most
[1:44:06] dangerous part of your life
[1:44:08] and he said why I said because you got
[1:44:10] all the right answers
[1:44:12] your mother and father have had
[1:44:14] devotions with you every night all your
[1:44:17] life and and you've heard the message of
[1:44:19] the hour you've heard brother brother
[1:44:20] Yvonne preaching to you all your life
[1:44:22] and you know just what to say
[1:44:25] every time I ask you a question you give
[1:44:27] me the right answer
[1:44:29] I said but see brother it takes more
[1:44:31] than that
[1:44:32] it takes a surrender
[1:44:34] and I said listen brother I I came to a
[1:44:37] place in my life where I heard a man
[1:44:39] preaching about a life
[1:44:42] i hidden live with Christ
[1:44:44] and I and I had decided after that
[1:44:47] sermon that I just couldn't live that
[1:44:49] kind of life
[1:44:50] so I got on my knees and I said Lord I'm
[1:44:53] going to leave this church and I'm never
[1:44:55] coming back I can't live that kind of
[1:44:57] life
[1:44:58] I just can't
[1:45:00] I got to the door to leave and something
[1:45:04] just spoke to me and said the bridges
[1:45:05] are all burnt where are you going to go
[1:45:07] you know the message of the hour is the
[1:45:09] last stop it's the last bus stop
[1:45:12] there are no more of the stops
[1:45:15] when I come to this message I realize
[1:45:17] there's no place else for me to go
[1:45:21] I can't escape it I'm responsible for
[1:45:23] what I've come to
[1:45:25] so I went home that night and I told my
[1:45:27] wife I'm gonna go in my room and settle
[1:45:29] this with God
[1:45:30] and I went in my bedroom and locked the
[1:45:32] door and I got on my knees and started
[1:45:35] praying that once again don't go home
[1:45:37] and think you have to do the same thing
[1:45:39] to come to the same conclusion but don't
[1:45:41] do the same thing
[1:45:43] and I got rolled around in a carpet and
[1:45:46] beating on the carpet and you know and
[1:45:48] every time God God asked me for
[1:45:49] something more in my life I struggled to
[1:45:52] give it up
[1:45:54] give up your job
[1:45:55] I was I was I had a great job working
[1:45:57] for General Motors I was a skilled
[1:45:59] Tradesman I made lots of money and I was
[1:46:01] very comfortable and the Lord this was
[1:46:03] 1988 I was just a young man
[1:46:06] and he said are you willing to give up
[1:46:08] your job well I struggled for an hour
[1:46:10] before I said yes
[1:46:12] are you willing to give up your family
[1:46:14] I struggled for another hour wrestling
[1:46:17] with myself
[1:46:19] you know what it is is a death
[1:46:22] you give up your Ambitions for the
[1:46:25] future
[1:46:27] give up your children
[1:46:30] and I struggled and I prayed and I got
[1:46:33] to a place where the Ron I started
[1:46:34] beating my head on the wall
[1:46:36] fighting with myself fighting with my
[1:46:38] flesh
[1:46:40] but thank the Lord I come to a place
[1:46:43] where I surrendered everything to the
[1:46:45] Lord
[1:46:47] I was drenched in sweating my wife was
[1:46:49] worried because I was screaming and
[1:46:51] yelling at the Devil again in my life
[1:46:53] and you know
[1:46:55] yeah yeah you can call me Pentecostal if
[1:46:58] you want to but he got me someplace
[1:47:01] you don't have to do it that way
[1:47:04] you don't have to do it the way I I
[1:47:05] didn't know any other way to do it but I
[1:47:08] knew I wanted Christ I wanted to hit
[1:47:11] life with Christ
[1:47:13] see I come out of the Catholic church
[1:47:16] but I wanted to get into Christ
[1:47:20] I wanted to have that relationship that
[1:47:22] the prophet had
[1:47:24] I wanted to hear the voice of God
[1:47:28] and it took a labor
[1:47:30] prayer
[1:47:32] until I finally pushed past all my
[1:47:35] desires of life
[1:47:37] and I broke through into the presence of
[1:47:39] God and my life began to change
[1:47:42] I stopped being just a church member
[1:47:49] God began to give me open Visions I had
[1:47:52] open Visions God began to speak in my
[1:47:54] ear
[1:47:56] and I began to have Supernatural
[1:47:58] experiences with the Lord
[1:48:00] in a month or two after I had that
[1:48:02] experience the Lord revealed to me I was
[1:48:03] going to New York City
[1:48:05] a year and a half before I actually
[1:48:07] moved there before I actually went there
[1:48:09] to start the church
[1:48:11] and so my life changed because I
[1:48:14] surrendered everything to Christ
[1:48:16] so you know what happened the eighth
[1:48:18] messenger came into my life
[1:48:22] I had this seventh messenger
[1:48:24] but the eighth messenger came
[1:48:27] the seventh Mentor messenger took me out
[1:48:30] of Egypt
[1:48:31] but the eighth messenger took me into
[1:48:33] the Promised Land
[1:48:36] so I challenge you young people don't
[1:48:39] just sit on your on your chair or do
[1:48:42] nothing God wants to use you
[1:48:46] last month I was giving this testimony
[1:48:48] in my church I said there's there's a
[1:48:50] young man here that God wants to use
[1:48:53] I said I don't know who he is but I feel
[1:48:55] the pool to say that
[1:48:57] you if God wants more out of your life
[1:49:02] you know a month later a man approached
[1:49:05] me he actually holds an office
[1:49:09] remember you mentioned this last month I
[1:49:11] said yes sir he said that was me brother
[1:49:14] God wants more on me and he just started
[1:49:17] to weeping
[1:49:18] I said well what what is it God's asking
[1:49:20] he said I don't know I said well brother
[1:49:21] make it your life mission to find out
[1:49:24] do you know that the only people that
[1:49:27] will go on the Rapture are those that
[1:49:29] are found in Christ
[1:49:30] you know what Christ represents the
[1:49:33] perfect will of God
[1:49:36] if you live in the permissive will of
[1:49:39] God being a message believer you'll stay
[1:49:41] behind
[1:49:43] only those that are found in the perfect
[1:49:46] will of God will go into rapture
[1:49:49] that is the magnet
[1:49:51] that's what God uses a man that
[1:49:54] surrenders himself to walk in the
[1:49:57] perfect will of God
[1:49:59] that's what's going to be magnetized
[1:50:01] nothing else
[1:50:04] there's more and more to this life
[1:50:06] to be offered God wants us to come into
[1:50:10] Christ completely
[1:50:13] so we see that the cycle of redemption
[1:50:15] and every dispensation was always the
[1:50:17] same
[1:50:18] it always ended with a restoration
[1:50:20] Prophet revealing the original way which
[1:50:24] was the the blood of an innocent one
[1:50:27] and the the eighth messenger of the Holy
[1:50:30] Spirit coming to confirm it and reveal
[1:50:33] it to the individual
[1:50:34] can I ask you to stand we'll have a word
[1:50:37] of Prayer
[1:50:38] we'd like to pray for the young people
[1:50:40] especially
[1:50:42] really have a burden for you in my heart
[1:50:45] this age we're living in
[1:50:53] father
[1:50:56] you know the things I've said are true
[1:50:58] Lord
[1:51:00] I had to fight Lord I had to struggle
[1:51:02] against myself
[1:51:06] what the prophet said his true Lord that
[1:51:09] his worst enemies was William Branham
[1:51:12] and Lord we find that our worst enemy is
[1:51:15] this flesh Lord
[1:51:17] full of ambition and worldly desire Lord
[1:51:21] the lust of the eye and the lust of the
[1:51:23] flesh Lord the pride of life
[1:51:25] Lord that's what we struggle against
[1:51:27] father
[1:51:29] the seventh Angels come
[1:51:32] and we see he said the same thing John
[1:51:35] the Baptist said
[1:51:36] he said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:51:39] and all he did was repeat what Samuel
[1:51:42] said father
[1:51:43] the first messenger in his dispensation
[1:51:47] Samuel also said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:51:50] the Lord it takes the pillar of fire to
[1:51:53] take us into Christ Lord
[1:51:55] I pray for these young people Lord
[1:51:59] right now Lord perhaps you're speaking
[1:52:01] to some young man
[1:52:03] some little sister Lord perhaps you're
[1:52:05] asking a little more from them Lord
[1:52:08] a complete surrender
[1:52:11] so that Pentecost could come into their
[1:52:13] life
[1:52:14] so that they could actually have a
[1:52:17] relationship with that eighth messenger
[1:52:19] Lord
[1:52:20] would you do it right now Lord speak to
[1:52:23] their heart confirm it to them Lord let
[1:52:26] them not be afraid oh God
[1:52:29] because you're a good God you promise to
[1:52:31] take us into a land full of milk and
[1:52:34] milk enough you promised to give us the
[1:52:36] victory over all the enemies
[1:52:46] we committed to you we thank you for
[1:52:48] this opportunity to share oh God what we
[1:52:51] see
[1:52:52] oh God will we believe concerning this
[1:52:55] message Lord bless your people father we
[1:52:58] pray
[1:52:59] the Holy Spirit have his way
[1:53:02] let the adults oh God be an
[1:53:04] encouragement to the young people father
[1:53:06] let them make that phone call extend
[1:53:09] that hand show the love of God to them
[1:53:12] Lord they need that father
[1:53:14] O Lord and let love control everything
[1:53:17] that's done here father we pray
[1:53:25] may the Lord
[1:53:30] [Music]
[1:53:34] I should probably
[1:53:35] [Music]
[1:53:43] amen
[1:53:45] [Music]
[1:53:47] brother Branham said
[1:53:50] if I'm not the one
[1:53:52] [Music]
[1:53:55] perhaps I
[1:53:58] have not done what
[1:54:01] I was supposed to do
[1:54:03] there'll be another one come after me
[1:54:07] he said you know there'll not be two of
[1:54:09] us here at the same time
[1:54:12] do you see the diving board I've always
[1:54:15] told you the platform that he laid

[1:54:21] you

[1:54:25] there is another messenger

[1:54:44] eighth messenger the holy spirit is
[1:54:46] taking you now into every promise

[1:54:52] there's been so many that said I'm the
[1:54:54] one I'm that one I'm the eighth
[1:54:56] messenger they're missing the real
[1:54:59] messenger that comes after John the
[1:55:02] Baptist said look I I come I'm laying up
[1:55:05] a platform but the baptism I give you is
[1:55:09] under repentance there's one coming
[1:55:11] after me
[1:55:13] that is so much greater for he'll
[1:55:16] baptize you with the Holy Spirit and
[1:55:19] Fire
[1:55:21] many people miss it
