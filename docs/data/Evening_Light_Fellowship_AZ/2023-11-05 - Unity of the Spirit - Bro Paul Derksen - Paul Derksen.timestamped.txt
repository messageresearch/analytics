[55:09] Amen to him the word it's good to be
[55:12] here this morning I'll let you have your
[55:14] seats here for a
[55:16] [Music]
[55:17] moment we were hoping to come and to
[55:20] hear brother Ron speak but things have
[55:22] kind of taken a
[55:23] turn um
[55:26] there are things that take place behind
[55:28] the scenes I don't know if you noticed
[55:29] it but the brother that came up here and
[55:31] pushed a button over that was the preach
[55:34] button and I think he hit the three-hour
[55:37] preach button I'm I I can't
[55:40] see you know when you get to the word
[55:42] there's no starting or stopping it's
[55:44] just it's Eternal and just Without End
[55:47] but it's good to be here sure appreciate
[55:48] brother Ron and and the family there but
[55:51] it's uh been a real privilege we had him
[55:53] up there or saw him up there in in
[55:55] Saskatoon here a little bit ago and
[55:57] enjoyed the fellowship
[55:58] there mentioned that I had been raised
[56:01] in the message and I'm thankful for that
[56:03] amen but I was not born again until
[56:07] after I was
[56:08] married to be a Christian is much more
[56:11] than knowing about the message agreeing
[56:13] with the
[56:14] message believing the truths of the
[56:16] message I mean I I would have fought for
[56:19] it I was
[56:21] convinced but I hadn't been born again
[56:23] my life hadn't been changed and when the
[56:25] reality struck me and my life was
[56:27] changed I had a birden on my heart for
[56:29] for the young people in the message ever
[56:31] since realizing that we can be raised in
[56:33] the message and we've got to realize we
[56:35] must be born
[56:37] again and uh so we're hoping and praying
[56:40] this morning that this will be something
[56:41] that will will help us all just draw a
[56:43] little bit closer to him what we're
[56:46] going to speak on this morning now again
[56:49] we we left early and we were praying
[56:51] that all the connections would work and
[56:53] and so forth and the rental cars and
[56:54] I've never had a trip go so smooth as
[56:56] far as just everything I got to the
[56:58] rental car and there was nobody there we
[56:59] just went right through the line I've
[57:01] never had that happen before brother Ron
[57:04] had he he told me yesterday he was kind
[57:06] of looking forward to a day yesterday
[57:08] that he'd just be able to relax because
[57:10] he's going to have a guest speaker here
[57:11] and now it was like well will he be here
[57:13] in time so he was studying for Plan
[57:16] B and so I know how that goes I've been
[57:19] on both sides of that situation but uh
[57:22] regardless the Lord had a purpose at all
[57:25] we're thankful for that now so he's
[57:26] prepared for next Sunday or or whenever
[57:28] the Lord would lead him maybe maybe
[57:30] we'll have him up our way and he can
[57:31] take the notes and bring it there but
[57:33] but God's in control amen what I want to
[57:35] speak on this morning and I'm going to
[57:37] move real fast because there's so much
[57:39] that you want to get across it's
[57:40] something that has changed my life in
[57:42] the last couple years and uh it
[57:44] continues to do that and I know that
[57:47] there will be some from our group
[57:48] that'll be listening in so we greet you
[57:50] this morning I they'll probably might
[57:52] not stream it I don't know what the time
[57:54] difference will will be whatever else
[57:55] but uh I I I believe this is something
[57:58] that we need to be reminded of back home
[58:00] again as I went through this and this
[58:02] was on my heart I realized I needed to
[58:05] be reminded again because you can have
[58:07] something that God reveals to you and if
[58:08] you aren't careful then all of a sudden
[58:10] it kind of you lose the focus it slips
[58:12] away and oh yes you need to be reminded
[58:14] and brought back amen and that's it's
[58:16] done that for me again as I've last few
[58:18] days going through this so my prayer is
[58:21] that this will be something that will
[58:22] change your lives things that I believe
[58:25] that are are crucial for the coming of
[58:27] the Lord things that he's left in our
[58:29] hands and you know it's always that way
[58:31] God has certain things that he's asked
[58:33] us to do and then he'll do all that he's
[58:36] promised amen I mean it's almost like
[58:39] and our part is so insignificant but
[58:41] it's crucial you know if if you're at
[58:44] the bottom of a 100 story building
[58:46] there's an elevator to go
[58:47] up okay well just push the button here
[58:51] and you get in and push floor 100 and
[58:54] then the elevator does it but you got to
[58:56] push the button that's right we have our
[58:59] part to do and so we we we we always
[59:02] want to do God's
[59:04] part and forget to do our part and
[59:07] that's kind of what we're going to be
[59:09] looking at a little bit this morning if
[59:10] you'll stand with me we're going to read
[59:12] from Ephesians 1 and from Genesis
[59:15] 1 and this first part is the foundation
[59:19] before we get to our text but you'll see
[59:22] I think in the end why this is crucial
[59:24] that we that we catch the context or the
[59:26] setting of of what we want to speak on
[59:28] it makes the the real uh I guess the the
[59:32] heart of the the message this morning to
[59:34] have a a purpose that we can hold on to
[59:36] I think with maybe a little bit more
[59:38] Assurance but Ephesians chapter 1 we
[59:40] want to read verses 9 and the first part
[59:42] of verse
[59:44] 10 having made known unto us the mystery
[59:48] of his
[59:49] will according to his good pleasure
[59:51] which he hath purposed in himself amen
[59:54] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[59:56] of times now that's our time that he
[59:59] might gather together in one all things
[1:00:02] in Christ now that's God's will that
[1:00:05] it's a
[1:00:06] mysterious Supernatural thing that God
[1:00:08] has purposed and it's for our time
[1:00:12] everything has been building building
[1:00:13] building for our time this is the time
[1:00:15] that God has purposed in himself I am
[1:00:17] going to gather together all things in
[1:00:21] myself in
[1:00:23] Christ Genesis chapter 1 veres 27 and
[1:00:27] the first part of
[1:00:29] 28 so God created man in his own image
[1:00:33] in the image of God created he him male
[1:00:35] and female created he them and God
[1:00:39] blessed them and God said unto them be
[1:00:41] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[1:00:44] Earth and subdue it let's just ask the
[1:00:48] Lord to Quicken his word to us this
[1:00:50] morning Heavenly Father we we can read
[1:00:53] we can hear the word
[1:00:55] but only your Holy Spirit can make it
[1:00:56] live to Quicken it father and that's
[1:00:58] what we need and that's what we come
[1:01:00] asking because we know that is your will
[1:01:02] and desire for us Lord I pray that you'd
[1:01:05] help me to step aside Lord that somehow
[1:01:07] you could could use my lips or whatever
[1:01:10] to speak the words but then I pray each
[1:01:13] ear each heart would be anointed to
[1:01:15] receive it that we might be changed we
[1:01:18] leave this place and say that that God
[1:01:20] has come and and and done something in
[1:01:22] my life his word has changed me that's
[1:01:24] my prayer this morning even though I
[1:01:25] might be delivering the message Lord I
[1:01:27] want to be changed by Your Word by your
[1:01:29] spirit Quicken these things to us now in
[1:01:31] jesus' name we pray amen amen God bless
[1:01:35] you you can be
[1:01:36] seated now I want you to to realize now
[1:01:39] when it says God created man and he
[1:01:41] created man he he didn't just create
[1:01:42] Adam he created
[1:01:43] Mankind we were created back then and
[1:01:46] then he brought forth the first man and
[1:01:48] he put him here on Earth but he was a
[1:01:50] spirit man because he was in the image
[1:01:51] of God but if you'll notice this
[1:01:54] commission was given when Adam was yet
[1:01:57] that one single spirit being so this
[1:02:01] commission is not just the the the
[1:02:03] natural commission to multiply replenish
[1:02:06] the Earth and and populate it with with
[1:02:08] human beings In the Flesh it is a
[1:02:10] spiritual commission brother R says this
[1:02:12] in marriage and divorce he says that's
[1:02:14] why he said to Adam before sex was ever
[1:02:16] introduced multiply to replenish the
[1:02:18] earth when he was yet in the beginning
[1:02:20] when he was yet both male and female in
[1:02:23] himself it shows that the bride's got to
[1:02:25] come from the word by spiritual
[1:02:27] multiplications replenishing the Earth
[1:02:30] so we're going to see that this
[1:02:31] commission that God gave there at the
[1:02:33] beginning it is an eternal commission
[1:02:35] that means it's still his commission
[1:02:36] today that's right we are still under
[1:02:39] that commission and it's a spiritual
[1:02:42] commission and the bride has to come
[1:02:44] forth by that spiritual
[1:02:46] commission so at that time we know that
[1:02:50] then God then put Adam into flesh and
[1:02:52] then he separated him into two physical
[1:02:54] beings that was all for his purpose of
[1:02:57] of part of this Commission because it
[1:02:59] did include uh bringing forth the the
[1:03:02] physical Tabernacles that the Spiritual
[1:03:04] Beings that were created would would
[1:03:06] dwell in now they were to come forth by
[1:03:08] a spoken word at that at that original
[1:03:10] spot so at this point there are two
[1:03:13] beings that are are in in existence now
[1:03:16] to fulfill God's commission but they
[1:03:18] have not been given any details of how
[1:03:22] this is all going to unfold
[1:03:25] God likes to do it that way when he gave
[1:03:27] Abraham the the commission he says
[1:03:29] follow me to a place I'll lead you he
[1:03:31] didn't tell him where it was he went and
[1:03:33] then he says okay uh in ER and his
[1:03:35] father passed away and then he went on
[1:03:37] and he came to the Palestine the pro
[1:03:39] says now this is the land he gave him
[1:03:40] more information he ran to Egypt and
[1:03:42] then came back because of circumstances
[1:03:44] he came back and then he gave he kept
[1:03:46] giving more he never gave all the
[1:03:47] details at the beginning God does that I
[1:03:50] think he's looking to see and to prove
[1:03:53] us if we can be tested that we'll just
[1:03:55] simply take him at his word trust him
[1:03:57] and act on and do what he wants us to
[1:03:59] do so Adam and Eve were they knew they
[1:04:03] were under the commission to be fruitful
[1:04:04] to multiply to replenish the Earth to
[1:04:06] subdue it they didn't know how they
[1:04:10] needed to just be patient and wait until
[1:04:13] God brought the details but in the
[1:04:15] meantime Satan comes along and he
[1:04:18] counterfeits something he brings a false
[1:04:21] fulfillment of God's word so
[1:04:24] spoken word's original seene she
[1:04:26] received Satan's lie what did she bring
[1:04:28] forth by doing it Satan said you know
[1:04:31] this is glorious this is a wonderful
[1:04:34] thing do you know you were made for that
[1:04:36] now think of that for a moment even
[1:04:38] though Eve was not originally to bring
[1:04:41] forth children in a sexual way but it
[1:04:44] was going to be a spoken word
[1:04:46] somehow she was made with that
[1:04:49] capability it was
[1:04:51] there amen there's another thought you
[1:04:54] know that that here we are we have we
[1:04:56] have in us our blood if we cut our our
[1:04:58] our hand our blood will
[1:05:00] clot well God made man in the physical
[1:05:03] sense with that capability even though
[1:05:05] they had nothing to fear they didn't
[1:05:07] need it at that time but brother BR says
[1:05:09] God knew they would need it one day that
[1:05:11] they would be cut and they would need
[1:05:12] that capability so God has made us with
[1:05:15] with things that we might not even
[1:05:16] understand why and I believe there's
[1:05:18] things I'm getting into another thought
[1:05:19] here but there are things in our in our
[1:05:21] spiritual walk with the holy spirit that
[1:05:23] he is given us and created us that we
[1:05:25] don't even understand why we not might
[1:05:27] not even be aware of it but it's for a
[1:05:29] purpose and there will be a time when it
[1:05:30] will be necessary Hallelujah so at any
[1:05:34] rate he Satan says you were made for
[1:05:36] that and that was
[1:05:38] true he says why you actually made for
[1:05:40] this purpose so now she could bring
[1:05:45] forth
[1:05:47] life but it was not the spiritual
[1:05:49] commission that she could
[1:05:51] fulfill that spiritual commission be
[1:05:53] fruitful multiply that was not the
[1:05:55] physical bodies that was the tabernacle
[1:05:57] for that spiritual fulfillment to dwell
[1:06:00] in so Shake could bring forth the
[1:06:02] physical the natural but only God could
[1:06:05] bring that fulfillment of that
[1:06:09] commission so Satan says through this
[1:06:11] Union you can fulfill God's commission
[1:06:15] he goes on he says now if God said
[1:06:17] multiply to his bride to Adam's bride
[1:06:19] and replenish multiply and replenish the
[1:06:21] Earth that was God's commission and she
[1:06:23] would have done it when God give a
[1:06:26] commission which cannot perish God's
[1:06:28] word is eternal it cannot fail when he
[1:06:30] said multiply and replenish the Earth
[1:06:33] that was God's Eternal
[1:06:35] purpose well then it's still his purpose
[1:06:38] today to carry it out you cannot die
[1:06:41] God's not going to require something of
[1:06:42] us that is going to cause us to to die
[1:06:45] to be separated from God he says because
[1:06:47] it's his word you have to live and if
[1:06:49] that child would have been brought
[1:06:51] forthright there' have been no death but
[1:06:53] she couldn't wait so she could bring
[1:06:55] forth the flesh bodies but she could not
[1:06:58] accomplish the real replenishing of the
[1:07:00] earth bringing those those mankind the
[1:07:04] the the spirit beings that were a part
[1:07:05] of God in this in his Spirit she could
[1:07:08] not bring them forth she could not place
[1:07:10] them in that that body that was that was
[1:07:13] coming from her herself and so forth so
[1:07:16] as we go on here we're going to see that
[1:07:18] God has a commission he has a union that
[1:07:22] he has purposed and Satan always comes
[1:07:25] by behind him and brings a false
[1:07:28] counterfeit to it and that always brings
[1:07:30] death and Division and separation amen
[1:07:34] so in the message oness he says what did
[1:07:36] he tell Adam and Eve go on and multiply
[1:07:39] replenish the Earth scattered the human
[1:07:41] race all over the Earth so he could deal
[1:07:46] with them
[1:07:47] individually that's
[1:07:49] interesting till he could bring them
[1:07:52] back together says look you need to be
[1:07:56] one but I've got to do it so for now I'm
[1:08:00] going to separate you scatter you
[1:08:02] through all the years and I'm going to
[1:08:03] deal with you
[1:08:05] individually he took Cain and and sent
[1:08:08] him away and different things I'm going
[1:08:10] to bring you together but I've got to do
[1:08:13] it and until then I need to have you
[1:08:16] separated so I can deal with you each
[1:08:18] one individually dealing with the people
[1:08:20] individuals each person but they didn't
[1:08:22] want it that
[1:08:25] so what happened next of course we know
[1:08:28] that the first false Union was there
[1:08:30] between the serpent and and and Eve so
[1:08:32] further on the same message is a false
[1:08:34] Union brought judgment on the earth to
[1:08:36] Eve and Adam in Eden and a false Union
[1:08:40] brought the floods of God's judgment on
[1:08:41] the earth because that the daughters of
[1:08:43] Cain flirted with the sons of God and
[1:08:46] they fell for it and United together
[1:08:48] again there you are false
[1:08:50] Union so he says look I I am scattering
[1:08:53] you I'll bring you together again so
[1:08:55] what did Satan do well look and he
[1:08:58] brings the daughters of man with the
[1:08:59] sons of God and he brings a false Union
[1:09:02] a mixing and that brought judgment
[1:09:05] again we're going to see this pattern
[1:09:07] over and over and over God's commission
[1:09:09] his purpose his Union and Satan comes in
[1:09:11] with something that sounds so real uh
[1:09:15] reasonable sounds so
[1:09:18] right but it's just a little bit off and
[1:09:21] it brings death amen so now we can come
[1:09:24] to the time of Noah after the Judgment
[1:09:26] comes and and and Noah's the flood and
[1:09:29] so forth and so in the future home he
[1:09:31] says after he come out of the flood just
[1:09:32] like it was with Adam before after he
[1:09:34] come upon the new Earth he said multiply
[1:09:37] and replenish your there's God's Eternal
[1:09:39] commission it was given to no okay this
[1:09:42] is this is a brand new start to the
[1:09:43] earth now this commission has to be
[1:09:45] fulfilled go forth and replenish the
[1:09:48] Earth notice was to be fruitful
[1:09:51] replenish the Earth as adamant the first
[1:09:54] so then we come in and again in in in in
[1:09:56] the message Oneness he says now after
[1:10:00] that after the death of Noah and that
[1:10:02] spiritual family of Noah first thing you
[1:10:03] know the children of men begin to look
[1:10:05] at one another what did they do they
[1:10:07] said now we're not infidels we all
[1:10:09] believe in
[1:10:13] God so they got a fellow by a leader
[1:10:16] some great Archbishop by the name of
[1:10:17] nimrod and they built a
[1:10:20] tower to bring Unity oh yeah
[1:10:25] but it was a forced
[1:10:26] Unity he conquered the Ley he brought
[1:10:30] them under
[1:10:31] his carnal leadership and his carnal
[1:10:35] Authority they wasn't infidels they
[1:10:38] believed there was a heaven they
[1:10:39] believed there was a hell they believed
[1:10:40] in judgments but the children of God
[1:10:41] were the the daughters of men again and
[1:10:43] they made them themselves a union
[1:10:46] falsely built a great big Cathedral big
[1:10:48] organization all the other places was to
[1:10:50] Babel was to pay tribute to it so
[1:10:54] they did not have what was needed once
[1:10:57] again for the true Unity that God had
[1:11:00] purposed they could bring a Unity yes
[1:11:04] and and and they were unified to where
[1:11:05] they could build this great building God
[1:11:07] came down and he says we we got to
[1:11:09] separate them because because they're
[1:11:11] unified they could do almost
[1:11:13] anything and so what did he do he
[1:11:16] separated them again like he did after
[1:11:18] the Garden of Eden by changing their
[1:11:19] language where they couldn't understand
[1:11:21] one another and so they scattered
[1:11:22] through all the Earth again but once
[1:11:25] again we have uh it sounded reasonable
[1:11:28] every time and it had an element of
[1:11:30] truth to it amen that's the way Satan
[1:11:33] does it always he will he came to Eve
[1:11:36] quoting did not God say thus and US yes
[1:11:39] but he also said oh no no no no God's a
[1:11:42] good God you know just and so he'll
[1:11:43] he'll twist and pervert it
[1:11:46] always is the approach that Satan take
[1:11:50] takes so now we could go through but I
[1:11:52] want to jump ahead to pentec cost
[1:11:54] because this is the time now that God
[1:11:58] had said I'm I'm I'm I'm separating you
[1:12:00] scattering you until I can bring you
[1:12:02] together again this was the time he was
[1:12:04] pointing to this was where the real
[1:12:06] Unity of God was going to be brought
[1:12:08] forth was when he gave his own Spirit
[1:12:10] there at Pentecost that's what unifies
[1:12:13] US amen it's his spirit that unifies us
[1:12:17] and that's our thought this morning the
[1:12:18] unity of the spirit thank you Lord
[1:12:21] so in Father the hour has come he says
[1:12:24] the time had come for Joel's prophecy to
[1:12:26] be fulfilled the time had come for Jesus
[1:12:28] to pour out his spirit for with
[1:12:30] stammering t lips in other tongues will
[1:12:32] I speak to this people that's Joel's
[1:12:33] prophecy this is the rest that should
[1:12:35] come from the presence of the Lord no
[1:12:37] matter if they never spoke since Babylon
[1:12:40] their languages had been scattered and
[1:12:42] there were some that they couldn't
[1:12:43] understand one another and maybe they
[1:12:44] had never been able to communicate since
[1:12:48] Babylon but it was the time had come for
[1:12:51] God to unite the Nations together and
[1:12:54] band together one heart and one Accord
[1:12:57] not under a man like Nimrod not under a
[1:12:59] system like the Babylonian
[1:13:02] religion but this was God's
[1:13:05] Unity I will place my spirit in them and
[1:13:09] they will be one because they are born
[1:13:10] of The Same Spirit they will be all part
[1:13:12] of the same family there's the unity
[1:13:15] that God was was had had planned from
[1:13:17] before the foundation of world
[1:13:19] everything was working towards that but
[1:13:20] Satan kept interjecting himself and
[1:13:22] twisting things and just a little bit
[1:13:23] off to to bring a false Union and every
[1:13:26] time it it it brought death and Division
[1:13:29] and separation from
[1:13:32] God now when he came there at the time
[1:13:36] of Pentecost Mark 16:15 says he said to
[1:13:39] them go into all the world preach the
[1:13:41] gospel to every commission there's the
[1:13:42] commission again be fruitful mul
[1:13:45] remember it was a spiritual commission
[1:13:48] to bring forth the spiritual Sons and
[1:13:50] Daughters of
[1:13:51] God the T Tabernacles are just kind of
[1:13:55] incidental what's really important God
[1:13:58] created Man In His Image mankind they
[1:14:00] were male and female so we have a
[1:14:03] spiritual birth that needs to take place
[1:14:06] and that commission is still upon us go
[1:14:09] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:14:11] and it doesn't mean just preach like
[1:14:12] what I'm doing here to this morning it
[1:14:14] is with the power and demonstration of
[1:14:16] the Holy Spirit it is a new birth that
[1:14:18] takes people that have been born in the
[1:14:20] message agree with the message and it
[1:14:22] changes them they pass from death and
[1:14:24] life and they're never the same after
[1:14:27] thatl that's the same commission to Adam
[1:14:30] to Noah all the way here to the day of
[1:14:32] Pentecost the commission continues on to
[1:14:35] this day in
[1:14:39] 2023 now we know kind of skipping ah
[1:14:42] head here a little bit um brother B says
[1:14:45] in Fellowship God made one preparation
[1:14:47] for man to be restored back to that
[1:14:50] Fellowship one preparation he says blood
[1:14:52] was the way back to fellowship no other
[1:14:55] way no Organization no strong leader the
[1:14:59] blood of Christ was the only way back he
[1:15:01] says this is God's way it was God's way
[1:15:03] it will always be the right thing to
[1:15:06] Fellowship through the blood
[1:15:07] reconciliation bringing the believer
[1:15:09] back into contact with his maker we've
[1:15:11] tried to educate people to it it'll
[1:15:13] never work we've tried to draw
[1:15:14] denominational barriers and say because
[1:15:16] you go to this church or this see what's
[1:15:19] the whole point of that we're trying to
[1:15:20] build a Unity because everybody body
[1:15:23] here believes this certain thing a
[1:15:24] certain way so we have
[1:15:26] Unity step back a little bit and say
[1:15:29] yeah you've got division because you've
[1:15:30] drawn a circle around our little group
[1:15:31] and all the others out in God's economy
[1:15:35] are not part of us see that's a
[1:15:37] reasonable thing to our carinal mind but
[1:15:40] it's not God's plan or provision that's
[1:15:44] right so now when he told him he says I
[1:15:49] want you to to go and Terry in Jerusalem
[1:15:52] you you shall be Witnesses unto me yes
[1:15:56] sir but you need to T in Jerusalem until
[1:16:00] you be filled or indued with
[1:16:02] power so again how is this going to
[1:16:05] happen they didn't know just like they
[1:16:08] had given the commission Adam and Eve
[1:16:10] didn't give them details but they needed
[1:16:12] to be patient to wait until God did what
[1:16:15] he was going to do and told them what
[1:16:16] they needed to know and so they did this
[1:16:18] they went to the upper room and now they
[1:16:20] are just simply waiting getting ready
[1:16:23] prepared for
[1:16:25] it because it takes the power of the
[1:16:27] Holy Ghost to be able to fulfill the
[1:16:30] commission amen because it's a spiritual
[1:16:33] commission bringing forth Spiritual
[1:16:36] Beings so God's Unity is a Unity of the
[1:16:39] spirit so they knew what was come to
[1:16:41] pass but they couldn't do it of
[1:16:43] themselves they couldn't make it come to
[1:16:44] pass it needed God to do it that's and
[1:16:47] that's why he gave his holy spirit in
[1:16:49] the message conferences he says notice
[1:16:51] on the day of Pentecost what did God do
[1:16:53] knew he took that big Pillar of Fire and
[1:16:55] divided it that was himself tongues of
[1:16:58] fire fork tongues clothing tongues came
[1:17:00] down Fork tongues and set upon each one
[1:17:04] oh listen to this he says we ought to be
[1:17:06] ashamed to let our organizations divide
[1:17:09] us when God divided himself Among Us
[1:17:12] that we might be
[1:17:14] one amen isn't that a statement
[1:17:18] Hallelujah shame on us that we do and
[1:17:20] and I'm preaching myself this is how my
[1:17:23] life changed two years ago all of a I
[1:17:25] realized God that's
[1:17:27] me I'm guilty of
[1:17:30] this and so how dare we divide when
[1:17:35] God divided himself so he could give
[1:17:39] each one of us a portion of himself so
[1:17:41] that we would be
[1:17:42] one I like that amen he says God divided
[1:17:46] himself we're never divided one another
[1:17:49] because we're parts of
[1:17:52] God amen if that hits home we could just
[1:17:55] dismiss the service and all is well if
[1:17:57] that really sinks in deep that's a
[1:17:59] life-changing reality isn't
[1:18:02] it we're never divided because we're
[1:18:05] parts of
[1:18:06] God and we all see everything exactly
[1:18:09] the same and no no no no no
[1:18:12] no I'm going to jump way ahead we have
[1:18:14] four children we had three two years
[1:18:19] apart and then we were done for 11 years
[1:18:22] we thought
[1:18:25] and surprised God had a real blessing
[1:18:26] for us and we had number four now let's
[1:18:30] fast forward about three
[1:18:33] years this little
[1:18:36] guy sure doesn't sound like these
[1:18:39] three I mean you can talk to these about
[1:18:42] this and this and this and have a
[1:18:43] conversation makes sense but this
[1:18:45] one pH he was every bit of durksen as
[1:18:49] those he just wasn't as mature yet but
[1:18:52] he was on the road he was growing he was
[1:18:54] maturing and every one of us if we've
[1:18:56] been born of the spirit the Holy Spirit
[1:18:58] has been given us to lead us into all
[1:19:00] truth and we are at different stages of
[1:19:02] our journey different amounts of
[1:19:04] Revelation and so we look that well he
[1:19:06] doesn't have the Revelation that I do he
[1:19:08] might be further up the road we just
[1:19:09] don't even realize that or it might be
[1:19:12] vice versa then we need to have Grace R
[1:19:14] but when we recognize we are of the same
[1:19:16] father The Same Spirit we have a unity
[1:19:20] and it's not measured by our maturity or
[1:19:22] our Revelation it's measured by our
[1:19:25] Birth by that holy spirit thank you
[1:19:29] Lord now in Jesus Christ same yesterday
[1:19:31] today and forever he says now I want you
[1:19:33] to think of
[1:19:35] this this Upper Room
[1:19:37] experience waiting there for 10
[1:19:40] days he says I think the 10 days that
[1:19:43] they were waiting for the original and
[1:19:45] first outpouring of the Holy Spirit how
[1:19:47] that must have been a unifying
[1:19:51] time so they all went into the upper
[1:19:54] room because they needed to be unified
[1:19:56] they had to be of one heart and one
[1:19:58] Accord okay it must have been a unifying
[1:20:01] time of the people all in one heart and
[1:20:03] one Accord and every time that that man
[1:20:05] gets together like that since then the
[1:20:07] holy spirit always meets with them I
[1:20:10] like that every time if we've come here
[1:20:13] together in one heart one Accord the
[1:20:14] holy spirit will meet with us
[1:20:17] always but that's what was necessary
[1:20:20] that first time when he first ided
[1:20:23] himself and filled the different ones
[1:20:24] there the 120 with himself parts of
[1:20:26] himself the licks of fire the Holy Ghost
[1:20:29] but they had to get into one heart and
[1:20:31] one Accord they had there had to be a
[1:20:33] unifying in that manner that was their
[1:20:36] part that's right then God could fill
[1:20:38] them with the real unifying power which
[1:20:40] was
[1:20:43] him so now after Pentecost what does
[1:20:46] Satan
[1:20:47] do he brings a false
[1:20:50] Unity the nickan spirit
[1:20:55] the power and demonstration of the
[1:20:57] Gospel became a formal
[1:21:00] religion the commission was not being
[1:21:02] carried out anymore oh they were going
[1:21:04] through the
[1:21:05] motions everything looked good just like
[1:21:07] the children of Israel when they would
[1:21:09] they would bring their sacrifice on the
[1:21:10] feast days when they were commissioned
[1:21:12] they were doing exactly what but their
[1:21:13] heart wasn't into it right it was just a
[1:21:16] routine it was a tradition it was carnal
[1:21:19] and it became a stench in God's nose so
[1:21:22] this is the the first early church there
[1:21:24] they were do you realize brother man
[1:21:26] says they had everything it was perfect
[1:21:28] why didn't God just take his bride home
[1:21:30] because you and I weren't brought forth
[1:21:33] yet thank you Lord the commission hadn't
[1:21:35] been fulfilled throughout all the ages
[1:21:37] there was the elect of God that had to
[1:21:39] come forth right in their age and their
[1:21:41] time in our age and our time and so all
[1:21:45] of this had to take place and so while
[1:21:46] this has been going on Satan has been
[1:21:48] working behind the scenes to bring a
[1:21:50] false Unity like always
[1:21:54] saying that this is how you fulfill
[1:21:56] God's purpose this is the way to to
[1:21:59] bring this into reality but it's a
[1:22:04] lie the nickan spirit once again brought
[1:22:06] forth a forced
[1:22:08] religion the nickan religion or uh
[1:22:13] spirit there was a continuation of the
[1:22:15] Babylon religion from Nimrod Babylon
[1:22:19] that's that organized religion it's that
[1:22:21] for brother says that is a forced
[1:22:23] religion you got to believe it this way
[1:22:25] you got to do this or else and then they
[1:22:27] cut you off and in during the Dark Ages
[1:22:30] it was even a physical where they 68
[1:22:32] million Martyrs because they didn't
[1:22:34] believe the way that that the Catholic
[1:22:35] Church said you must believe that's
[1:22:38] right see they were trying to bring a
[1:22:40] Unity a purity let's get rid of all the
[1:22:42] heresy do you believe this I kid fine
[1:22:45] they're gone do you believe this okay
[1:22:47] now they're part of
[1:22:49] us that's right that was the unity they
[1:22:52] were trying to build amen and it was
[1:22:54] reasonable to them but that was Satan
[1:22:56] reasoning wasn't it that's
[1:23:00] right so that's all
[1:23:04] history so what about
[1:23:06] today where are we at what's going on
[1:23:09] today what are we challenged with how
[1:23:11] does Satan work against us and here's
[1:23:14] where it really hit home and this is
[1:23:15] where it really changed my
[1:23:18] life changed the focus of our church and
[1:23:22] is continuing to do
[1:23:25] that here's kind of where it starts he
[1:23:28] says in missionary talk from Middletown
[1:23:30] he says where we've made a fatal
[1:23:33] mistake is not following this
[1:23:37] commission go into all the world and
[1:23:39] preach the gospel or demonstrate the
[1:23:41] power of the Holy Ghost to every nation
[1:23:42] and every people what have we done we've
[1:23:45] went and made schools organize people
[1:23:48] together make them well they don't
[1:23:50] believe just like we do don't associate
[1:23:52] with them them don't go around their
[1:23:55] churches
[1:23:58] Lord I've done that oh we'll be
[1:24:03] friendly God bless you brother God bless
[1:24:06] you but but he doesn't believe like I do
[1:24:09] so I'll be friendly I'll smile and shake
[1:24:11] his hand but I really don't want to
[1:24:12] fellowship with
[1:24:14] him I said Lord that's what I've been
[1:24:17] doing I had a
[1:24:20] circle and those that didn't see just my
[1:24:23] way but you know the funny thing is if I
[1:24:25] had gone back to where I was 10 years
[1:24:27] ago I was outside of that Circle where I
[1:24:29] was 10 years further amen because I've
[1:24:32] been LED along more Revelation the Holy
[1:24:34] Spirit leading to more truth so if I
[1:24:36] draw the line where I'm at today where
[1:24:37] am I going to be two years five years by
[1:24:40] God's grace moving forward
[1:24:43] amen so a fatal mistake what we've done
[1:24:47] they don't believe just like we do don't
[1:24:49] associate with them don't go around
[1:24:51] their churches
[1:24:54] he says this there's many quotes like
[1:24:56] this here's another one for him will I
[1:24:57] accept he says the only thing that's
[1:24:59] holding off the coming of our Lord Jesus
[1:25:00] for his church and setting of his
[1:25:02] kingdom is the differences between the
[1:25:04] Full Gospel
[1:25:06] people the only
[1:25:09] thing as long as one say I belong to
[1:25:11] this I belong to that I received this I
[1:25:13] did that and don't recognize the brother
[1:25:15] as your brother I believe that's one of
[1:25:17] the hindrances we have now one of the
[1:25:18] hindrances of not receiving Jesus
[1:25:20] Christ's coming amen and I thought Lord
[1:25:24] this isn't just message this is this is
[1:25:28] me I'm guilty of this amen God have
[1:25:31] mercy forgive
[1:25:33] me and I made that right with our people
[1:25:36] we had it at camp and I made it right
[1:25:38] there in front of people from many
[1:25:40] churches I have called many ministers
[1:25:44] and said brother forgive me I have not
[1:25:47] been a real Christian the way brother
[1:25:49] Brandon said I have I have tried to
[1:25:53] build my own little
[1:25:56] unity and I'm
[1:25:58] wrong and I'm part of what's holding off
[1:26:00] the coming of the
[1:26:02] Lord and you know what I
[1:26:04] found the
[1:26:06] fellowship that we have and it's not
[1:26:08] just where we can tolerate one another
[1:26:10] it's fervent love for one another big
[1:26:14] difference big
[1:26:16] difference brother BR brother Billy says
[1:26:18] you could never tell brother bram's
[1:26:20] enemies from his friends by the way he
[1:26:21] treated them
[1:26:28] in questions and answers he says this
[1:26:31] when God's people begins to gather back
[1:26:34] together and that's what I believe is
[1:26:36] happening in my life and in others that
[1:26:38] I know yes we're beginning to gather
[1:26:40] back together it's it's something is
[1:26:42] stirring something is taking place the
[1:26:44] coming of the Lord is close look at the
[1:26:46] news look at the conditions in the world
[1:26:48] I mean everybody knows something's
[1:26:50] fixing to happen and it could be
[1:26:52] tomorrow amen when God's people begins
[1:26:55] to gather back together there's Unity
[1:26:56] there's power and whenever God's people
[1:26:59] gets together completely I believe the
[1:27:01] resurrection will take place then there
[1:27:03] will be a rapturing time when the Holy
[1:27:05] Spirit begins to gather it up so there's
[1:27:07] a Unity once again this is God's
[1:27:09] Commission in the fullness of times that
[1:27:11] he wants to gather all together in
[1:27:14] Christ and when we truly get to that
[1:27:17] place that's when the Resurrection The
[1:27:18] Rapture is going to take place so
[1:27:21] there's something that he's
[1:27:22] they had to they had to be in the upper
[1:27:24] room to get into one Accord one heart
[1:27:26] one Accord so he could give his spirit
[1:27:28] and there's something he's waiting for
[1:27:29] here that we have a minor part but a
[1:27:32] crucial part so that he can do what he's
[1:27:35] promised to
[1:27:36] do but I haven't been faithful probably
[1:27:39] most of us haven't been faithful if we
[1:27:41] really are honest with ourselves not to
[1:27:43] the extent that we could or should
[1:27:47] amen thirsting for life he says when I
[1:27:49] can see all the different Full Gospel
[1:27:51] people with one heart and one Accord
[1:27:53] standing together as one big army it'll
[1:27:55] bring Jesus Christ to the Earth just as
[1:27:57] certain as I'm standing
[1:28:00] here one heart and one Accord see that's
[1:28:04] why you got to believe like
[1:28:08] me you see the quick detour to Satan
[1:28:10] takes us to that's right yes we need to
[1:28:13] be one yes I can see that and I'm so
[1:28:15] thankful for the Revelation God's given
[1:28:17] me now if you could just Embrace that
[1:28:20] will have see that's that's the way he
[1:28:22] works and it seems so reasonable to us
[1:28:29] amen let's go back to the upper
[1:28:33] room I think that we think of it as 120
[1:28:37] people they were all fishermen that had
[1:28:40] been kind of
[1:28:42] together do you know who those 120 were
[1:28:44] made up
[1:28:45] of brother B says lamb and the dove he
[1:28:48] says there was 120 people up there
[1:28:51] Pharisees
[1:28:53] Sadducees and
[1:28:56] everything there were some from the
[1:28:58] Pharisee background that were following
[1:29:01] Jesus but they had their Pharisee
[1:29:03] Doctrine and there were some that came
[1:29:05] from the sadducee denomination following
[1:29:07] Jesus but they had their sadducee
[1:29:09] Doctrine and those two doctrines were
[1:29:11] totally opposite you remember later on
[1:29:14] Paul where he's called before the
[1:29:15] Sanhedrin what does he do he pits the
[1:29:18] Sadducees and the Pharisees against each
[1:29:20] other because the Sadducees don't
[1:29:21] believe in spirit they don't believe in
[1:29:22] angels they don't believe in the
[1:29:23] resurrection and it's very important to
[1:29:26] the Pharisees so he says now the reason
[1:29:28] these guys over here against me is
[1:29:29] because I believe this and they don't
[1:29:31] and now oh so now there on Paul's side I
[1:29:34] mean there was no friendliness there was
[1:29:35] no Unity between Pharisees and Sadducees
[1:29:38] and they were in the upper room so you
[1:29:40] know what happened all these years and
[1:29:43] years and years of this doctrinal
[1:29:44] differences they were able to that
[1:29:46] resolved in those 10 days thank you
[1:29:50] Lord not a chance
[1:29:53] you think they resolved those
[1:29:55] generations of
[1:29:57] differences but you know what they did
[1:30:00] they said you know what these things
[1:30:02] don't
[1:30:05] matter what I believe here doesn't
[1:30:07] matter what you believe there doesn't
[1:30:09] matter we're here because Christ has
[1:30:11] commissioned us to come and wait till
[1:30:13] we're endued with power and they join
[1:30:15] together with that focus and God came
[1:30:18] down gave him the Holy Spirit now the
[1:30:20] holy spirit's there to lead them both to
[1:30:22] all truth and little by little by little
[1:30:24] they would have they would have realized
[1:30:25] the error of their understandings their
[1:30:27] their their Revelations and so forth
[1:30:29] they would have been led to all truth
[1:30:31] they did not do that in a carnal human
[1:30:34] way they were not resolving these
[1:30:36] things in that upper room they were
[1:30:39] waiting for God to send the power to
[1:30:41] accomplish what needed to be done but
[1:30:44] there was a one heart one Accord that
[1:30:45] they could come into that was their
[1:30:50] part the other part was God's part and
[1:30:53] we're going to get into Ephesians 4 in
[1:30:55] just a moment and we're going to see the
[1:30:57] two different
[1:31:00] unities they put aside all the things
[1:31:04] that they had made circles and divisions
[1:31:06] over I believe this and they don't so
[1:31:09] here's our Circle they're out because
[1:31:10] they don't see this and this is
[1:31:12] important this is crucial do you think
[1:31:13] it's important to believe in the
[1:31:15] resurrection you think it's important to
[1:31:17] believe in in in spirit beings and
[1:31:19] angels of course well then of course
[1:31:21] those sag they're out about there was
[1:31:23] some of them in the upper room there was
[1:31:25] something a seed in their heart God was
[1:31:27] calling amen something that as we look
[1:31:30] back with hindsight something real but
[1:31:33] where they were at right now they were
[1:31:34] in this place of division each one
[1:31:37] standing for what they were convinced
[1:31:39] was the truth with good motives and
[1:31:41] intentions but they had drawn a circle
[1:31:44] that brought
[1:31:46] Division and so what they had to do is
[1:31:48] they say you know what these things
[1:31:51] aren't important
[1:31:53] let's just put them
[1:31:54] aside I'm not going to make this
[1:31:56] something that we're here together God
[1:32:00] has spoken to you the Lord Jesus spoke
[1:32:01] to you he spoke to me he gave us this
[1:32:03] commission to come here we he he's
[1:32:04] called us to be
[1:32:06] Witnesses in Jerusalem and then
[1:32:08] throughout the whole Earth but he said
[1:32:10] we need to T here and wait till we're
[1:32:12] endued with power I don't know how he's
[1:32:14] going to do I don't know what's going to
[1:32:15] come Eve didn't know what was going to
[1:32:17] come she should have just waited they
[1:32:20] did wait and God came down and filled
[1:32:23] them with the holy ghost in a way that
[1:32:24] they probably never imagined amen and
[1:32:27] now the unity that had been separated
[1:32:30] there at the Babylon with the with the
[1:32:32] separation of the of the languages now
[1:32:35] all these different ones that couldn't
[1:32:36] understand their languages Peter spoke
[1:32:38] and they all heard in their language
[1:32:40] that's the unity of
[1:32:43] God you don't need the Rosetta Stone and
[1:32:45] a bunch of interpreters to accomplish
[1:32:47] that God has a way when he brings a
[1:32:49] Unity it's real it's Supernatural and
[1:32:52] it's what is necessary to get us out of
[1:32:58] here now we want to go to Ephesians 4
[1:33:01] this is
[1:33:02] my
[1:33:06] text and it won't be as long as the
[1:33:09] background but I wanted you to see this
[1:33:12] pattern of what's going
[1:33:14] on that God has a commission he has a
[1:33:18] purpose he's going to bring bring the
[1:33:20] unity that is needed that's his M
[1:33:22] mystery of his will and Satan always
[1:33:25] comes in and counterfeits it and and and
[1:33:28] and makes it sound so reasonable and and
[1:33:31] realistic and sounds spiritual but it
[1:33:34] isn't because it's contrary to God's
[1:33:36] word with that as a background let's
[1:33:39] look now as Ephesians 4 here's where we
[1:33:41] come to the unity of the spirit
[1:33:44] Ephesians 4: 1
[1:33:46] to8 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[1:33:49] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[1:33:52] vocation wherewith you are called what's
[1:33:53] a vocation that's your calling in life
[1:33:57] you might be a farmer you might be a
[1:33:58] lawyer you might be a doctor that's your
[1:34:00] vocation that's what your life is all
[1:34:02] about in the natural it's how you make
[1:34:04] your living whatever else you've got a
[1:34:06] vocation as Christians there is
[1:34:08] something that we've been called to we
[1:34:09] have a vocation a purpose why we're here
[1:34:12] so he says I beseech you walk worthy of
[1:34:15] this vocation that God has called you to
[1:34:18] walk
[1:34:19] worthy oh my yes you got to go get four
[1:34:22] degrees in college and this no how how
[1:34:24] can we walk worthy of of this great
[1:34:26] vocation that God's called us with all
[1:34:29] loneliness and meekness amen with
[1:34:36] longsuffering if everybody was just like
[1:34:38] me there'd be no
[1:34:41] suffering it's when we run into people
[1:34:44] that aren't just like us we got to have
[1:34:46] patience with them we got to be
[1:34:47] longsuffering for he says forbearing one
[1:34:50] another in in love amen and here's the
[1:34:53] key endeavoring and endeavoring means it
[1:34:56] takes effort it takes choices takes
[1:35:00] action endeavoring to keep the unity of
[1:35:03] the spirit in the bond of
[1:35:07] Peace if I could put it this way we have
[1:35:10] been given a
[1:35:12] Unity because we've been born of The
[1:35:14] Same Spirit we have a un so we are to
[1:35:18] keep we aren't to
[1:35:20] create we not to make the UN he says no
[1:35:22] keep the unity of the spirit I have
[1:35:25] given you a Unity you're all born of one
[1:35:28] Spirit I've given you a Unity Endeavor
[1:35:31] to keep that with all loneliness and
[1:35:33] meekness longsuffering forbearing one
[1:35:35] another in
[1:35:37] love now I've used we need to
[1:35:41] maintain that Unity of the spirit if I
[1:35:43] can use those
[1:35:45] terms brother Ron have you maintained
[1:35:48] your uh 200ft yacht lately
[1:35:52] you
[1:35:53] haven't well he doesn't have one he
[1:35:55] can't maintain what he doesn't have
[1:36:01] yeah you notice I said 200 foot yacht I
[1:36:03] didn't know about 100 foot or where you
[1:36:05] know I I had to be careful I didn't
[1:36:06] [Laughter]
[1:36:10] know we can only maintain what is ours
[1:36:14] if we got a car you better maintain it
[1:36:15] if you don't that engine's going to blow
[1:36:18] you can get by for a while but it's the
[1:36:20] the Day of Reckoning will come there
[1:36:22] will be a price to
[1:36:24] pay so we need to maintain we need to
[1:36:26] keep the unity spirit because he gave it
[1:36:28] to us we have it it's ours right now
[1:36:34] that's why we've gathered together like
[1:36:36] this we have a Unity of the spirit we've
[1:36:37] been born of that same Spirit do we all
[1:36:39] see eye to eye of course not my wife
[1:36:42] hasn't quite attained where I'm at yet
[1:36:45] either no she's probably ahead of me in
[1:36:47] in many ways but we are one in marriage
[1:36:51] but also also is Children of the
[1:36:54] Lord thank endeavoring to keep the unity
[1:36:59] of the spirit I want us to to Really
[1:37:01] catch that we have a Unity of the spirit
[1:37:04] we are one in that Spirit if we've been
[1:37:06] born again not just raised in the
[1:37:08] message not just agreeing with the
[1:37:10] message not just knowing intellectually
[1:37:11] that yes brother R is a prophet I
[1:37:13] believe every word and and Jesus the son
[1:37:15] of God and yes we believe that but have
[1:37:17] you been born
[1:37:19] again have you TR he died to yourself
[1:37:22] and repented of your sins with a Godly
[1:37:24] sorrow and conviction and a full
[1:37:26] surrender a full commitment a full
[1:37:28] repentance then God will fill you and
[1:37:30] seal you with the Holy Ghost he will
[1:37:32] he'll never fail to keep his word but we
[1:37:35] just come partway well that's fine it's
[1:37:38] not that you haven't come anyway but
[1:37:39] just keep on until you reach that place
[1:37:41] of full
[1:37:42] commitment then you watch God will meet
[1:37:44] you there so endeavoring to keep the
[1:37:47] unity of spirit that's what we miss is
[1:37:49] that we have that yes and we don't value
[1:37:53] it we don't recognize it to the extent
[1:37:56] that we ought to amen we don't realize
[1:37:58] what God is really we get so busy and
[1:38:00] preoccupied and distracted and the Devil
[1:38:03] comes in injects this and injects this
[1:38:04] and we focus on this and we yes
[1:38:07] but but I have a Unity that God gave me
[1:38:09] and that's my vocation which I've been
[1:38:12] called so he says there's one body one
[1:38:14] Spirit even as you are called in one
[1:38:16] hope of your calling one Lord One Faith
[1:38:19] one baptism one God and father of all
[1:38:21] who is above all and through all and in
[1:38:23] you
[1:38:25] all but unto every one of us is given
[1:38:27] Grace according to the measure of the
[1:38:29] gift of Christ wherefore he saith when
[1:38:31] he ascended up on high he would he
[1:38:33] ascended on high to make the atonement
[1:38:34] for us but that's another subject he led
[1:38:37] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[1:38:42] men that's what our gifts are for in the
[1:38:44] body of Christ now there are five office
[1:38:47] gifts and there are nine spiritual gifts
[1:38:50] and every member of the body has at
[1:38:52] least one
[1:38:53] gift and we need to ask God lord use me
[1:38:56] where and how you desire to use me for
[1:38:59] the purpose of your body Amen to please
[1:39:02] you father because we've been
[1:39:05] commissioned now to finish his
[1:39:07] work I don't have those quotes with me
[1:39:09] right now but but it's a wonderful
[1:39:11] reality the church is to finish the high
[1:39:15] priest work of Jesus
[1:39:17] Christ and even today the devil trying
[1:39:20] to take that that
[1:39:22] away don't need preachers anymore don't
[1:39:25] need this anymore there's no place for
[1:39:27] this that's not what the word
[1:39:30] says so now we come to Ephesians
[1:39:33] 4:11 these gifts that he gave un man and
[1:39:36] he gave some Apostles some prophets some
[1:39:39] evangelists some pastors and teachers
[1:39:42] for the perfecting of the Saints and we
[1:39:44] make a big mistake I think lot of time
[1:39:45] it isn't the perfecting oh I now I'm
[1:39:48] perfect I'll never have another thought
[1:39:49] again that's wrong I just no it's the
[1:39:52] completing bringing it to its
[1:39:54] completeness what we've been ordained to
[1:39:57] be those five offices can't perfect only
[1:40:01] the blood of Christ and the grace of God
[1:40:04] can perfect Us in the the way that we we
[1:40:06] use the English word perfecting but you
[1:40:08] go and look what the meaning of it is in
[1:40:10] the Greek it's for the completing of the
[1:40:12] Saints we're down here God has
[1:40:14] commissioned us to be something and so
[1:40:16] we're here to help to to bring everyone
[1:40:18] to what God has commissioned us to be
[1:40:20] amen the occasion where we've been
[1:40:21] called to so he says for the perfecting
[1:40:24] of the Saints the completing of the
[1:40:26] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:40:28] the edifying for the building up of the
[1:40:31] body of Christ
[1:40:33] till in other words this is not
[1:40:35] something that we have right then we
[1:40:38] have the unity of the spirit says till
[1:40:40] we all come in the unity of the
[1:40:43] faith there's a Unity of the spirit
[1:40:46] which we have the moment we're born
[1:40:48] again we are now in that Unity of the
[1:40:50] spirit but then there's a process that
[1:40:52] is underway and he's that's what the
[1:40:53] body of Christ is all about is a part of
[1:40:55] that process till we come to the unity
[1:40:58] of the
[1:41:03] faith the unity of faith is a work in
[1:41:06] progress It's the goal or purpose of our
[1:41:08] commission but once again the commission
[1:41:11] can only be accomplished by God Amen I
[1:41:14] can't bring a Unity of the
[1:41:16] faith Eve couldn't bring forth a
[1:41:19] spiritual seed of God into a body she
[1:41:21] could bring forth the body but she
[1:41:23] couldn't do the spiritual
[1:41:25] part we can keep in one Accord in one
[1:41:29] heart because that just means
[1:41:31] longsuffering and humility and meekness
[1:41:33] and dying to ourself and forbearing one
[1:41:35] another recognizing why we are are are
[1:41:38] are one in
[1:41:40] Christ but you and I even though I'm
[1:41:43] preaching I can't bring a Unity of the
[1:41:45] faith God has to do that he'll use maybe
[1:41:49] the words that I speak but then the Holy
[1:41:50] Spirit has to Quicken it to each one we
[1:41:53] can read it in the Bible still takes the
[1:41:55] Holy Spirit to Quicken to it we can
[1:41:57] listen to a
[1:41:58] tape but we still need the Holy Spirit
[1:42:00] to Quicken it to each one of us and that
[1:42:02] is a
[1:42:03] process okay so the unity of Faith it's
[1:42:07] the goal or the purpose of the
[1:42:08] commission to be multiplied and be
[1:42:10] fruitful to multiply to replenish the
[1:42:12] Earth that was the goal of the
[1:42:13] commission but only God could correctly
[1:42:16] bring it to that fullness that
[1:42:19] completion the commission gave them
[1:42:21] there at Pentecost only God could bring
[1:42:23] it to the place that it needed to be
[1:42:25] they could do their part they could
[1:42:26] gather in the upper room they could put
[1:42:28] aside all these things that divided them
[1:42:29] say those don't matter and then God
[1:42:32] could bring his unity and if we can do
[1:42:34] our part of endeavoring to maintain the
[1:42:37] unity of spirit God will do his part to
[1:42:39] bring a Unity of the faith he has to do
[1:42:45] that now this is a quote that I found
[1:42:48] years ago and it struck me but I never
[1:42:50] saw really how it fit into the picture
[1:42:51] that piece of puzzle God's provided a
[1:42:53] way to Fellowship he says help us Lord
[1:42:55] to have Unity of the
[1:42:57] spirit until Unity of the faith is
[1:43:00] brought
[1:43:02] forth and when we shall see him face to
[1:43:04] face then we'll see eye to
[1:43:10] ey and we're convinced that we can see
[1:43:13] eye to eye if you just see it my
[1:43:16] way no
[1:43:18] no and then I found one was even
[1:43:20] stronger this comes from message to the
[1:43:22] ly in church fitting name he says
[1:43:25] talking about Jesus he longs to get in
[1:43:27] to have Fellowship in his people he's
[1:43:28] knocking at the door come into communion
[1:43:30] to bring you something good but the
[1:43:32] church and the people keeps him away to
[1:43:36] coming down because you say well that
[1:43:38] group don't believe just like I do what
[1:43:41] difference does that make that has
[1:43:43] nothing to do with
[1:43:46] it now I'm going to bring a balance to
[1:43:49] this we are are Christians born again in
[1:43:51] the same family a bunch of pilgrims will
[1:43:54] never see eye to eye until we see him
[1:43:58] face to face
[1:44:00] okay never well then why am I struggling
[1:44:04] so hard to bring a Unity of Faith If You
[1:44:07] Could See It My Way it isn't going to
[1:44:11] happen amen until we see him face to
[1:44:14] face and that's when the resurrection's
[1:44:15] taking place and there we are our bodies
[1:44:17] are changed and all whatever's all going
[1:44:19] to take place there when we see him I
[1:44:21] die that's when we'll see we'll see I
[1:44:23] die when we see him face to face
[1:44:25] Hallelujah that's when the fullness is
[1:44:27] going to come and the unity of faith
[1:44:28] will be brought forth but we have a
[1:44:30] Unity of spirit now we have since Christ
[1:44:33] died in in day of Pentecost sent his
[1:44:37] Spirit maintain that endeavor to
[1:44:40] maintain that it's not something that
[1:44:43] just happens by itself it takes effort
[1:44:46] it takes death to our will and our
[1:44:48] reason and our pride and our carnality
[1:44:53] it we'll never see eye to eye until we
[1:44:57] see him face to face and be changed and
[1:44:59] made like unto his own glorious
[1:45:04] body so this is God's plan that's what's
[1:45:08] Satan
[1:45:09] doing he has a false
[1:45:14] Unity thirsting for life he says can you
[1:45:16] see now why I'm standing for the unity
[1:45:18] of every church every F gospel chur
[1:45:20] every believer we ought to be one heart
[1:45:23] one mind and one Accord no matter how
[1:45:25] much we different in the scriptures that
[1:45:27] might be one might see this that way or
[1:45:30] that has nothing to do with it but in
[1:45:32] principle we ought to stand one Great
[1:45:34] Mighty Army of God marching on ever
[1:45:37] present water he says that's exactly
[1:45:39] what Pentecost did when it began to
[1:45:40] organize it began to break up Fellowship
[1:45:42] saying well now we won't associate if
[1:45:44] this guy believes that go ahead stay
[1:45:47] with him till he comes to the word of
[1:45:49] Truth the the knowledge of truth
[1:45:51] whatever it is let it go anyhow just go
[1:45:53] on be as brothers
[1:45:56] amen oh but we had to organized say well
[1:45:59] because you're not Oneness because
[1:46:00] you're not Tess or threeness or like
[1:46:01] this we won't have no fellowship with
[1:46:03] you and see these are things that are
[1:46:05] stepping on my toes
[1:46:06] hard
[1:46:09] god brother BR says until you're honest
[1:46:12] with yourself he says you'll never be
[1:46:14] honest with
[1:46:16] God he also said if we can't be honest
[1:46:18] with our brothers we'll never be honest
[1:46:19] with God
[1:46:22] I said Lord that is me that is me I'm
[1:46:27] guilty woe is me like Isaiah said I'm a
[1:46:30] man of unclean limps
[1:46:32] I God forgive me amen make this
[1:46:36] Revelation
[1:46:38] heartfelt may it intensify every day may
[1:46:41] may I walk worthy of the occasion which
[1:46:42] you've called me to
[1:46:44] Lord and that's why I say it has changed
[1:46:46] my life oh I I'm he's still working on
[1:46:48] me and that's why I say I think it's
[1:46:50] time we need to bring this back to our
[1:46:52] church because I I went through this
[1:46:53] thought you know what we're starting to
[1:46:55] slip back into some of these attitudes
[1:46:56] some of these things and oh not
[1:46:58] intentionally but the devil's a wiy
[1:47:01] adversary and our carnal reasoning and
[1:47:03] and and intellect and everything else is
[1:47:05] a good Target that he can work
[1:47:08] on and we need to be on
[1:47:10] guard the message where I think
[1:47:12] Pentecost failed he says the reason the
[1:47:15] church is not progressing brother he
[1:47:17] says you're fussing about your
[1:47:18] organization your denominations whether
[1:47:20] you're this that or the other whether
[1:47:21] you're Oneness Tess threeness or Fess
[1:47:23] whether you've been baptized Face
[1:47:24] Forward face backwards all kinds of
[1:47:26] things and fussing and drawing barriers
[1:47:27] and things that's the reason the church
[1:47:29] is not going on if you'd ever break down
[1:47:32] your walls let this one be this and that
[1:47:35] one be that whatever you are that
[1:47:37] doesn't matter but when you can put your
[1:47:40] hands in your brother's hands and call
[1:47:42] him your brother and we're working for
[1:47:44] one cause that's the kingdom of God if
[1:47:47] it ever gets to places I couldn't put my
[1:47:48] arm around any brother that's working
[1:47:50] for the the kingdom of God and recognize
[1:47:51] him as my brother I feel I'm
[1:47:54] backslid I'd be scared to stand on the
[1:47:56] platform and face evil spirits to know
[1:47:58] that I had Envy in my heart against any
[1:48:00] brother no matter who he is that's
[1:48:01] trying to reach the go preach the Gospel
[1:48:03] of Jesus Christ or live a Christian Life
[1:48:05] if we disagree a million miles upon
[1:48:10] theology a million miles not just one
[1:48:14] little thing here and one little thing
[1:48:15] here because that's usually enough to
[1:48:17] kind of bring a division at least that's
[1:48:18] been my experience
[1:48:21] amen if we disagree a million if he
[1:48:24] loves the Lord Jesus he's my brother and
[1:48:25] it's my sister and we've draw those
[1:48:28] lines and if you can't love your brother
[1:48:29] who you have seen how can you love God
[1:48:31] who you can't have never seen amen so I
[1:48:35] believe that that the devil has come in
[1:48:37] and he has used our understandings of
[1:48:41] doctrines and truths and they might be
[1:48:43] absolutely
[1:48:48] correct it does matter what we believe I
[1:48:52] want to make it very clear I am not
[1:48:53] saying oh it doesn't matter what you
[1:48:55] believe just let all those things go we
[1:48:57] can okay let's baptize in the name of
[1:48:58] the father son holy yes because that way
[1:49:00] we have Unity see if the devil can't get
[1:49:01] you in this ditch he'll get you over the
[1:49:03] other
[1:49:06] ditch we must stand with what God has
[1:49:09] revealed to us but that's not the basis
[1:49:12] of our Unity you could have this little
[1:49:14] three-year-old that's been born again
[1:49:16] and he's just coming along and say well
[1:49:18] because you're not over here you're out
[1:49:19] of the picture
[1:49:21] just have
[1:49:22] Grace forbearing one another in love
[1:49:26] that's
[1:49:30] right Doctrine is
[1:49:32] important hold what God has shown you
[1:49:35] walk in the light but always with that
[1:49:37] comma button
[1:49:39] out Lord I believe this I see it in the
[1:49:41] word you you've made it real to me but I
[1:49:45] know that I don't have any cu the moment
[1:49:46] we put a period we're
[1:49:49] done we have succumbed now we have our
[1:49:51] own Tower of Babble we have our own
[1:49:55] false
[1:49:56] Unity this is it everyone gather around
[1:49:59] we've got it it's a com about and say
[1:50:02] Lord I I'll walk in this light as long I
[1:50:05] mean there have been people tell me I
[1:50:06] need to do this in my church I need to
[1:50:07] do that in my church I'm saying I don't
[1:50:09] see it I'm I'm walking in the light that
[1:50:12] I do see if I'm missing something pray
[1:50:15] for me I've got to see it in the word
[1:50:17] but for right now my combo button out
[1:50:19] and I've told him look if I find
[1:50:21] something I've missed and what we're
[1:50:23] talking about here is something I've
[1:50:25] missed and I've acted on it I've made
[1:50:27] things right I've I've I've apologized
[1:50:29] I've called all around the country and
[1:50:31] talked to different ones saying forgive
[1:50:32] me brother I have been wrong with good
[1:50:35] intentions I thought I was fulfilling
[1:50:37] the the the Commandments of the Lord for
[1:50:39] his
[1:50:40] kingdom standing as a Believer a
[1:50:42] champion of the
[1:50:45] faith and Satan is using that to divide
[1:50:49] and separate and bring death amen but my
[1:50:53] my commitment is Lord I've got the com
[1:50:55] about out if you can show me something
[1:50:57] and it's got to be in your word it's
[1:50:59] going to be in the Bible it's going to
[1:50:59] be in the message it's going to fit your
[1:51:01] pattern all says oh Lord I never saw it
[1:51:04] that
[1:51:05] way oh thank you let me just throw throw
[1:51:08] something out here to maybe help make a
[1:51:10] quick Point everything in God's word is
[1:51:13] a pattern so everything has to fit the
[1:51:16] pattern if you run into something
[1:51:18] doesn't fit the pattern you need to back
[1:51:20] Who whoo there's something I'm not
[1:51:22] missing I'm not getting right I'm
[1:51:23] missing something because God's word
[1:51:25] fits perfectly does not contradict
[1:51:27] itself that's right so I give you a a
[1:51:29] pattern here how many mathematicians do
[1:51:31] we have out
[1:51:32] there yeah you know better you've had
[1:51:34] teachers ask you and it's a trick
[1:51:36] question you're going to get set up but
[1:51:37] I'm just give you a simple
[1:51:39] pattern three five 7 what's
[1:51:45] next
[1:51:47] uh-uh that is a pattern
[1:51:50] but it's not the pattern I was thinking
[1:51:52] of you were thinking odd numbers and
[1:51:54] that would fit the pattern I'm thinking
[1:51:56] prime numbers 3 5 7 11 because nine is
[1:52:00] not a prime number
[1:52:02] 13 17
[1:52:04] 19 a prime number is a number can only
[1:52:06] be multiplied by
[1:52:07] itself three is 3 * 1 5 is 5 * 1 you
[1:52:11] can't do it any other way nine is 9 * 1
[1:52:13] and 3 * 3 it's not a prime number okay
[1:52:16] I'm not here for the math but I just I
[1:52:18] didn't want to leave you holding
[1:52:20] I didn't want to have them lost for the
[1:52:22] next week what in the world's going
[1:52:24] on and you'll notice I asked you I
[1:52:27] didn't ask brother Ron back here
[1:52:29] because I suspected he would would would
[1:52:32] maybe have troubles with that I didn't
[1:52:34] know I didn't want to risk our
[1:52:37] friendship but you you get the point you
[1:52:40] were all positive that you had the
[1:52:43] pattern figured out and so God's word
[1:52:45] going to fit the pattern that I see and
[1:52:46] all of a sudden you run into something
[1:52:48] that that doesn't fit the pattern what's
[1:52:50] going on and devil say well just set it
[1:52:52] aside don't worry about it no no no no
[1:52:55] it's all got to fit together the moment
[1:52:56] I run into something it doesn't fit the
[1:52:58] way I presumed God had had meant it I
[1:53:01] step back say Lord I thought I had the
[1:53:04] pattern but something doesn't fit here
[1:53:07] Matthew
[1:53:08] 28:19 Jesus everybody heard of
[1:53:12] Jesus pretty important
[1:53:14] person the fullness of the god in him
[1:53:17] Jesus said baptize the name of the
[1:53:19] Father the Son and the Holy Ghost and
[1:53:21] Peter who was just a fisherman couldn't
[1:53:23] sign his own name he said baptize in the
[1:53:24] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I've
[1:53:26] heard people say you know what I'm going
[1:53:28] to take what Jesus said I don't know
[1:53:30] what Peter was they don't realize
[1:53:32] there's a pattern they fit together so
[1:53:34] they're willing to pick and choose and
[1:53:36] that's what happens is we get into
[1:53:39] something and say okay now what am I
[1:53:40] going to do I'm going to pick this or
[1:53:41] I'm going to pick that you need to step
[1:53:43] back and wait and say God somehow these
[1:53:45] fit together I can't choose against any
[1:53:48] of your word
[1:53:50] but I need your Revelation and I'm just
[1:53:52] going to wait till you give it to me in
[1:53:53] the meantime I'm not going to go build
[1:53:55] some big Doctrine or or following or an
[1:53:58] ism over this understanding that
[1:54:00] understanding I'm just going to be
[1:54:01] humble forbearing
[1:54:03] longsuffering and realize my well this
[1:54:05] brother sees it that way it might be the
[1:54:06] truth this brother sees it that way it
[1:54:08] might be the truth but Lord you got to
[1:54:10] Quicken it to me in the meantime they're
[1:54:11] my brothers
[1:54:16] amen
[1:54:18] so we
[1:54:21] understand that we must have
[1:54:24] Doctrine and God is quickening his word
[1:54:27] to us but that is not the basis of our
[1:54:31] Unity
[1:54:33] right I I hope that comes clear because
[1:54:36] the devil will try to say well see
[1:54:38] brother Paul was saying it doesn't
[1:54:39] really matter what we believe just
[1:54:40] believe whatever you want not at all but
[1:54:44] be willing you real I've stayed on this
[1:54:46] and I believe this and all of a sudden
[1:54:49] oh my goodness there's more to what I
[1:54:50] saw well then Lord and if I have to make
[1:54:53] I've told the people of the church if I
[1:54:55] have to come back and say Brothers I
[1:54:56] stood on this with all I knew but
[1:54:58] there's more to it and I was just a
[1:54:59] little bit off Target because now the
[1:55:01] word says this forgive me for that but
[1:55:02] here's but I've got to be able to show
[1:55:04] it in the word
[1:55:06] amen I want the truth because they
[1:55:09] receive not the love of the truth God
[1:55:11] turned them over to strong
[1:55:14] delusions not because they didn't
[1:55:15] receive the truth but they didn't have
[1:55:17] love I've got to love a truth if you
[1:55:18] love the truth then you also love
[1:55:20] correction because if what you're seeing
[1:55:22] is not the truth you got to be corrected
[1:55:23] so you can have the truth that you
[1:55:25] love and it takes
[1:55:33] humility 11:45
[1:55:36] okay I was looking for a round
[1:55:41] clock see we don't have that up in
[1:55:43] Canada like
[1:55:46] that I got just a couple more things
[1:55:48] that I want to to bring out if I
[1:55:52] can the breaking down of the walls that
[1:55:55] we build because when we stand carnally
[1:55:59] intellectually for something and it
[1:56:01] might even be the actual literal full
[1:56:03] truth but we do it in a carnal way and
[1:56:06] we make it the basis for for for for
[1:56:09] Unity and with good intentions we cause
[1:56:12] Division and
[1:56:14] death so brother B says in Fellowship he
[1:56:16] says we always fence ourselves off and
[1:56:19] make and Clans but God wants us to tear
[1:56:23] down them
[1:56:25] barriers yes
[1:56:28] Lord if you want those barriers torn
[1:56:30] down please tear them
[1:56:34] down you know where the Bible says
[1:56:36] humble yourself oh Lord humble me no no
[1:56:40] we do it it's a choice that we make Amen
[1:56:44] brother that's the pushing the button to
[1:56:46] go up the elevator that's my part it's
[1:56:48] not much in the big picture picture but
[1:56:49] it's my
[1:56:51] part God wants us to tear and that's
[1:56:53] what I've been doing by God's grace I
[1:56:56] want to tear down the barriers that I
[1:56:58] built it was my
[1:57:01] fault God wants us to tear down them
[1:57:03] berries like all you are doing around
[1:57:05] here now bringing the whole body of the
[1:57:06] Lord Jesus in Fellowship around the
[1:57:08] sacrifice the Lord Jesus why my you talk
[1:57:11] about spiritual gifts in the church just
[1:57:13] keep that fellowship and Watch What
[1:57:14] Happens it'll pour down God
[1:57:16] automatically if you'll get the thing
[1:57:18] running right it'll run and God will add
[1:57:20] to it but you've got to get on the right
[1:57:21] Road first and you're on the right road
[1:57:23] now when you go to Breaking the
[1:57:24] denominational barriers down putting
[1:57:26] your arms around one another and say
[1:57:27] we're Brethren then you're on your road
[1:57:29] back you're on your road to the
[1:57:32] original and that's exactly right when
[1:57:34] you start walking this way and make it's
[1:57:37] been incredible what God has done in my
[1:57:39] life and in our our group and between
[1:57:42] different
[1:57:43] churches friendships and fellowships
[1:57:45] like we've never had before thank you
[1:57:47] Lord I believe that's God's desire his
[1:57:50] purpose we are in the dispensation of
[1:57:52] the fullness of times when he wants to
[1:57:53] bring all things together in
[1:57:55] Christ and we've been hindering it I've
[1:57:57] been hindering
[1:58:00] it this is a powerful one simple from
[1:58:03] the message once more always and I love
[1:58:06] those things always never only pay
[1:58:10] attention pay attention that's something
[1:58:12] you can really get a hold
[1:58:15] of you shall receive the gift of the
[1:58:17] Holy I like that it's not it's not
[1:58:21] wishy-washy he says always when the
[1:58:24] power of God comes in the walls that
[1:58:27] you've built around you fall
[1:58:30] always Lord I want your power to come in
[1:58:34] amen cuz I want these walls that I built
[1:58:36] to fall your denominational walls will
[1:58:38] crush and God will be known again he's
[1:58:40] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:58:42] then he goes on he says oh god let's
[1:58:44] break them walls down once more Lord I
[1:58:46] don't care we're at the end of the time
[1:58:48] folks we ain't got much
[1:58:51] left I said yes Lord let me break down
[1:58:54] those walls there's a quote I don't know
[1:58:56] if I have it in here but one place he
[1:58:58] says ministers break down them
[1:59:01] walls he says congregation he says if
[1:59:04] your ministers don't break your walls
[1:59:05] You Break Down The
[1:59:06] Walls so we're all under that
[1:59:12] commission another place is our little
[1:59:14] petty differences between our
[1:59:15] organizational fences and so forth has
[1:59:17] separated them as far as the East is
[1:59:18] from the West and God will never be able
[1:59:21] to do nothing to us never until them
[1:59:25] walls are broke down and we become one
[1:59:27] in Christ and it's not an understanding
[1:59:30] all the doctrines the same it's a Unity
[1:59:32] of the spirit amen we got to Endeavor to
[1:59:36] maintain that to keep
[1:59:39] that Palmer room caner caterpillar
[1:59:41] Locust he says God help us send us
[1:59:43] teachers that'll straighten to get these
[1:59:44] old middle walls of partition broke down
[1:59:47] so we can get to be one in Christ Jesus
[1:59:48] so the Rapture can take his home there's
[1:59:51] so many things that that this is
[1:59:52] essential it's
[1:59:55] important here he says um we need to lay
[1:59:59] aside every weight in the sin that e be
[2:00:01] set us that's part of this this this
[2:00:03] context or this topic he says ministers
[2:00:06] break down their middle wall of
[2:00:07] partition church members that'll forget
[2:00:08] the differences this is the one I was
[2:00:10] referring to but it's similar church
[2:00:11] members that forget the differences
[2:00:13] between the denominations of churches
[2:00:15] church members and ministers hold to the
[2:00:16] horns of the altar with one Accord and
[2:00:18] pray until the fire of God begins to
[2:00:20] fall again the stubbornness indifference
[2:00:22] of men has broke up and godly fear and
[2:00:24] Brotherly Love Takes its place in the
[2:00:26] human heart he says Christianity in
[2:00:29] action not just taught from the pulpit
[2:00:32] but acted among the members among the
[2:00:34] pastors that's when you see Christ
[2:00:37] Living in the
[2:00:39] church so we need Grace for one another
[2:00:44] that's love and action that's what
[2:00:46] Ephesians 4 was talking about meekness
[2:00:48] humility
[2:00:49] forbearing one another
[2:00:54] longsuffering so he says a minister
[2:00:56] called my wife about a month ago been
[2:00:58] talking to some scripture he firmly
[2:00:59] taking a stand that my belief in Divine
[2:01:01] Healing was wrong that the scriptures
[2:01:03] did not support what I was teaching that
[2:01:04] Christ was the same Jes yesterday da
[2:01:07] Fair that's what brother saying this
[2:01:08] brother is saying no well he's an
[2:01:10] American got a right to his own belief
[2:01:12] but I tried to talk to him nicely no
[2:01:14] matter how much he tried to argue I just
[2:01:16] talked to him like a Christian should
[2:01:17] talk stayed on what I believe but give
[2:01:19] him room for his
[2:01:23] belief you ever been in a conversation
[2:01:25] where you're not giving the other
[2:01:26] brother the room for his
[2:01:29] belief that's a durksen
[2:01:33] characteristic I'm going to stay with it
[2:01:35] until you finally see the truth because
[2:01:37] I've got
[2:01:40] it even if I've got the truth if I come
[2:01:43] across with that attitude you're never
[2:01:44] going to receive it from
[2:01:47] me I need to give you room room for your
[2:01:49] belief and then pray saying Lord you had
[2:01:51] to reveal it to me you got to reveal it
[2:01:52] to him and and maybe he's got something
[2:01:54] I'm missing and I need to you use a
[2:01:57] donkey to speak before I mean we
[2:02:00] limit how we will allow God to speak to
[2:02:02] us we need to be
[2:02:06] humble he goes on another place super
[2:02:08] sign he says we're grateful for every
[2:02:10] one of you I'm very thankful to God for
[2:02:12] every member of the body of Christ
[2:02:13] everywhere in all different phases of
[2:02:17] faiths
[2:02:19] 3 years
[2:02:21] old 14 17 or 16 18 I won't tell you how
[2:02:28] old my wife is or I
[2:02:30] but doesn't matter what phase we're
[2:02:34] in no matter how much they might
[2:02:36] disagree with me I'm still grateful that
[2:02:39] even if I think they'd be a little in
[2:02:41] error in the scripture but yet trying
[2:02:43] earnestly to stand for what they believe
[2:02:46] I'm certainly willing to bear with those
[2:02:48] Brethren and them bear with me in my
[2:02:49] errors and things because there's none
[2:02:51] of us perfect
[2:02:53] amen
[2:02:55] amen see the holy spirit's the lead us
[2:02:57] into all truth but none of us have
[2:02:59] reached the conclusion yet that's yet
[2:03:01] coming but in the meantime we want to
[2:03:03] keep pressing on by God's grace closer
[2:03:06] and closer more Revelation more light
[2:03:08] and then we should have more grace and
[2:03:09] more patience as we go up that ladder
[2:03:11] for those that are following behind that
[2:03:13] we can help them not criticize or
[2:03:15] condemn them or or be condescending to
[2:03:18] them
[2:03:19] proud and hoty because they're not oh
[2:03:22] Lord I Thank that I'm not like that
[2:03:23] Publican over
[2:03:25] there we hear those stories but we do it
[2:03:28] amen I did I do if I just that's right
[2:03:31] God I need I need more of your grace I
[2:03:34] need to be
[2:03:40] humble jumping ahead here life he says
[2:03:44] there's bound to be little things come
[2:03:45] up in difference of ideas here we are
[2:03:47] sitting here this morning as much in
[2:03:49] harmony as men could be I suppose but
[2:03:51] let us sit here a little
[2:03:53] bit and begin to talk first thing you
[2:03:56] know there'd be some brother say
[2:03:57] something the other might disagree with
[2:03:58] him a little bit I'd say that might
[2:04:00] happen
[2:04:01] here well maybe not here it would in our
[2:04:03] church
[2:04:04] anyway it happen in every group wouldn't
[2:04:07] it that's
[2:04:10] right he says now it takes real man real
[2:04:14] CH Christians to withstand that and
[2:04:16] still feel like a brother wow isn't that
[2:04:20] powerful isn't that the
[2:04:22] truth you've got to have it in your
[2:04:26] heart this Unity that God is looking
[2:04:28] it's got to be his
[2:04:30] Unity not some man-made
[2:04:33] denominational
[2:04:34] whatever a false Unity we want the real
[2:04:37] Unity takes a real man of God to be
[2:04:40] humble enough to give room for the
[2:04:42] brother in his belief even if it's
[2:04:44] wrong Lord just keep bringing him along
[2:04:46] I believe he's sincere he loves you he's
[2:04:48] given his heart to you he he's on the
[2:04:49] road he just needs more light and I need
[2:04:52] more light amen and then we help one
[2:04:56] another 1 Peter 4:7 the end of all
[2:04:59] things is at hand can we relate to that
[2:05:01] is that
[2:05:02] today be therefore sober which means in
[2:05:05] the right mind and watch under prayer
[2:05:09] and above all things there's one of
[2:05:11] those say above all things okay you got
[2:05:13] my attention this this is really
[2:05:15] important above all things have fervent
[2:05:17] charity among your elv amen not
[2:05:21] tolerance charity and fervent RedHot
[2:05:24] burning
[2:05:27] charity that's what
[2:05:31] leads to engagements like we saw this
[2:05:33] morning that's
[2:05:35] right hey you want to get married uh
[2:05:39] whatever I
[2:05:41] guess I think there was some fervent
[2:05:44] charity that was taking place in that
[2:05:45] relationship is that
[2:05:47] right but you know what what can also
[2:05:49] happen and it happens in marriages today
[2:05:52] then the cares of this life creep in and
[2:05:54] things start to cool off and we need
[2:05:58] we've been given the unity of the
[2:06:00] spirit we need to maintain it and we
[2:06:03] need to have that fervent charity above
[2:06:06] all
[2:06:07] things have fervent charity among
[2:06:10] yourselves 1 Peter 1:22 seeing you've
[2:06:13] purified your souls in obeying the truth
[2:06:15] through the spirit unto unfeigned not
[2:06:18] put on genuine love unfeigned love for
[2:06:20] the Brethren see that you love one
[2:06:22] another with a pure heart
[2:06:24] fervently that's what I believe that we
[2:06:27] need to see today I've got one more
[2:06:28] thing here and then we'll
[2:06:30] close and this is one quote but it kind
[2:06:34] of puts it all together and it ends in a
[2:06:36] in a way
[2:06:38] that I could never say it as good as
[2:06:41] what is said here this is one that just
[2:06:45] it stays with me
[2:06:47] constantly
[2:06:51] comes from the message I will
[2:06:53] restore I think that's
[2:06:56] fitting look where we are look where
[2:06:59] we've brought ourselves look at the
[2:07:00] barriers that I've built up look at all
[2:07:02] these different things that with good
[2:07:05] intentions I will restore sayith the
[2:07:07] Lord thank you Lord he's going to bring
[2:07:10] about the Fulfillment the finish of his
[2:07:12] commission it's his eternal commission
[2:07:15] it will be fulfilled
[2:07:17] amen
[2:07:19] yes so he
[2:07:22] says of course we people today we
[2:07:25] believe that there's three the father
[2:07:26] and the Son and the Holy Ghost is the
[2:07:28] three persons of the one true God it's
[2:07:31] three offices not three Gods now we all
[2:07:34] believe that so we've got the unity of
[2:07:35] the faith
[2:07:37] Brethren okay listen now we think that
[2:07:40] was ridiculous in the Catholic church
[2:07:42] but we went right down here at Pentecost
[2:07:43] and tore yourselves to pieces with it
[2:07:45] set up another organization started
[2:07:47] something else
[2:07:50] I'm going to stop for just a
[2:07:52] moment have you ever seen in the message
[2:07:54] where brother Ram talks about the new
[2:07:59] issue I thought he was just talking
[2:08:01] about things went along and then another
[2:08:03] issue came up a new issue there's
[2:08:05] another new issue no they had something
[2:08:08] that they called like we call this the
[2:08:10] message they had something called the
[2:08:12] new issue where do you stand on the new
[2:08:15] issue it was it was a huge thing in the
[2:08:18] ear Pentecostal church and they blew up
[2:08:21] and split over
[2:08:23] it what was that new issue well he says
[2:08:27] instead of coming like Brethren with
[2:08:29] brotherly love and with unity the first
[2:08:31] one begin to see that the three persons
[2:08:33] of the godhead was in one person Christ
[2:08:36] Jesus now that's
[2:08:39] truth it's it's it's a greater light a
[2:08:41] greater
[2:08:44] Revelation he was the manifestation of
[2:08:46] God in flesh not another man and then
[2:08:48] you set up and got the little dogmatic
[2:08:50] idea of the Oneness soall they went a
[2:08:52] little too far then you started on that
[2:08:55] begin to harp on it and you made God one
[2:08:57] like your finger one and you know that's
[2:08:59] wrong instead of setting and reasoning
[2:09:01] together when I come into the factions
[2:09:03] of the Pentecostals they set a table
[2:09:05] bigger than that with their heads around
[2:09:06] you go to this you can't go to this You
[2:09:08] Preach for them you can't preach for me
[2:09:11] I said we're Brethren
[2:09:12] absolutely and if the Oneness faction
[2:09:16] hadn't have went off to one side and
[2:09:17] made an issue out of it and would have
[2:09:21] stayed with their Brethren and let the
[2:09:23] Holy Ghost anoint them that thing would
[2:09:25] have never spattered and broke up
[2:09:26] Brotherhood the way it did amen but they
[2:09:29] had the
[2:09:31] truth they saw that the Trinity was not
[2:09:34] correct it wasn't
[2:09:37] scriptural hero Isel the Lord your God
[2:09:39] is one
[2:09:41] God Peter had the key baptized Jesus now
[2:09:45] we miss Matthew
[2:09:47] 28:18
[2:09:50] this is something my my dad was an
[2:09:51] English teacher before he was pastor and
[2:09:54] this is something has always stayed with
[2:09:55] me when you see the word therefore in
[2:09:58] the Bible go back and look what's it
[2:10:00] therefore something has been that's
[2:10:02] simple isn't it but we walk right by
[2:10:07] it it's because I've said
[2:10:15] something the pizza truck's going to
[2:10:17] come across here anding lunch therefore
[2:10:20] when you hear the Bell that's the we're
[2:10:21] going to close I mean okay so you you
[2:10:23] got to know what I said before so what
[2:10:25] I'm going to say now has some context
[2:10:26] and meaning why so when Jesus said in
[2:10:30] Matthew 28:19 go ye
[2:10:32] therefore teaching all men baptizing the
[2:10:36] name of the father Son and Holy Ghost
[2:10:38] for what reason what was the reason
[2:10:42] 2818 he says that God has given all
[2:10:45] power in Heaven and Earth to me
[2:10:48] go ye therefore and baptize the name of
[2:10:51] the father son and ghost because it's
[2:10:52] all in me now yes it's all been put here
[2:10:56] vested in
[2:10:57] me and that's the Revelation Peter
[2:11:01] had this same Jesus that you crucified
[2:11:04] God has made both Lord and Christ it's
[2:11:07] all in him therefore we baptize in the
[2:11:10] name of the Lord Jesus Christ because
[2:11:11] that is the Father the Son the Holy
[2:11:13] Ghost it's in one amen so when you see
[2:11:16] it therefore stop and make sure you
[2:11:18] understand where this is coming from man
[2:11:22] that opens things up in ways that you
[2:11:24] might not think but it does so he
[2:11:32] says that thing would have never spatter
[2:11:34] broke up Brotherhood the way it did it
[2:11:37] broke up Brotherhood you had to have a
[2:11:38] little Unity of your
[2:11:43] own it's an oxymoron two words that
[2:11:46] don't don't make sense
[2:11:48] a Unity of just
[2:11:50] us that's called
[2:11:54] separation and you go out there and you
[2:11:55] look in the political word world our
[2:11:57] social world there's a lot of things
[2:11:59] like that they say one thing and it's
[2:12:00] the exact opposite of what they say but
[2:12:03] we do that scripturally or spiritually
[2:12:05] he said you had to have a little Unity
[2:12:06] of your own Unity is not an isolated
[2:12:09] thing Brethren Unity is for the whole
[2:12:11] body of Christ not just for me and my
[2:12:13] little group my little family or
[2:12:15] whatever group I want to put it to those
[2:12:17] that follow follow me or whatever he
[2:12:20] says it started in the early days Paul
[2:12:23] said when I come among you one has this
[2:12:24] one has that one said I'm of sephus and
[2:12:27] I'm of
[2:12:29] Paul okay we got a decision make here
[2:12:33] today now sephus Peter he was given the
[2:12:36] keys to the kingdom I can't discount
[2:12:39] that that's pretty
[2:12:40] important but Paul on the other hand God
[2:12:44] met him on the road to Damascus
[2:12:46] commissioned him with a pillar of Fire
[2:12:48] and send him to be the Apostle to the
[2:12:51] Gentiles oh which one am I going to
[2:12:54] pick see that's our carnal way of doing
[2:12:56] it isn't it and they said well I'm of
[2:12:58] sephus yes but I'm of Paul and so you
[2:13:01] had that division starting way back
[2:13:05] then he says was sephus crucified would
[2:13:09] you baptize in the name of Paul well
[2:13:11] that stuff had already started it was
[2:13:13] eating into the church listen to this
[2:13:16] but they had in the beginning the unity
[2:13:18] of the one true God a Unity of the
[2:13:21] spirit endeavoring to maintain to keep
[2:13:24] that Unity he gave them the unity we
[2:13:26] have that unity in the spirit not of
[2:13:30] sephus not of
[2:13:32] Paul Unity of the spirit of
[2:13:36] Christ and then he says he heard from
[2:13:38] some Believers or friends down in South
[2:13:40] Africa and they have some that baptized
[2:13:43] three times Face Forward because the
[2:13:46] Bible says that Jesus pitched forward
[2:13:47] when he died and the other say no no no
[2:13:49] no no when you bury some you always lay
[2:13:51] them down backwards so you three times
[2:13:53] backwards and they split up over that
[2:13:56] two great divisions down there and they
[2:13:58] both and here they were now trying to to
[2:14:00] sponsor brother braham's meeting and
[2:14:01] this absolutely was a a thorn in the
[2:14:04] flesh of trying to to to for him to to
[2:14:06] work with but he
[2:14:08] says so they baptized him three times
[2:14:11] backward once for the father once for
[2:14:12] the son once for the Holy Ghost they and
[2:14:13] they split up my goodness Brethren can't
[2:14:15] you see don't you understand let it be a
[2:14:18] vision to you what difference does it
[2:14:19] make when we have lost our feeling of
[2:14:22] Brotherhood we're in a terrible shape
[2:14:24] but these little things that break out
[2:14:26] when somebody grabs it and said we'll
[2:14:28] make us a Unity he says that's not Unity
[2:14:30] that's pure petty jealousy
[2:14:34] amen I spoke on selfishness not here
[2:14:37] long
[2:14:38] ago I guess I've done it a few
[2:14:41] times and there's things that brother
[2:14:43] random identifies as selfishness that I
[2:14:44] wouldn't have
[2:14:46] recognized he he says I saw somebody
[2:14:49] that was wrong and he that little
[2:14:51] selfish spirit rose I need to go correct
[2:14:53] him come on
[2:14:56] selfish huh okay I'm missing something
[2:14:59] here I wouldn't have called that selfish
[2:15:01] I might have said it's wrong but I
[2:15:02] wouldn't have identified it as selfish
[2:15:04] and I started looking and there's a
[2:15:05] number of places he talks about that
[2:15:08] because I have the truth and I yeah it's
[2:15:11] selfish it's Pride
[2:15:15] amen it's pure petty jealousy when we
[2:15:18] draw these little things he we need real
[2:15:19] Christian Apostolic Unity Paul said some
[2:15:22] preach for one thing some preach for
[2:15:24] gain what difference as long as Christ
[2:15:26] has preached he had a right to call and
[2:15:27] said I know that after my departing
[2:15:29] Grievous wolves will enter in and some
[2:15:31] among you will raise up with perverse
[2:15:33] things and so forth but John trying to
[2:15:35] capit all said oh keep Christ the unity
[2:15:38] of Christ the love of God in our hearts
[2:15:40] little children love one another and
[2:15:42] I've heard the story told that when John
[2:15:45] the Revelator in his final days he L up
[2:15:47] into his n 90s I believe and he had to
[2:15:49] be helped up to the pulpit and he say
[2:15:52] Brethren love one another love one
[2:15:56] another don't let
[2:15:58] love that was his theme he was the same
[2:16:01] one that says Lord should we call down
[2:16:03] fire because they wouldn't let sell us
[2:16:05] uh food for lunch over
[2:16:08] here he was one of
[2:16:10] them but then says he became the
[2:16:12] Fountain of love he says you know not
[2:16:15] what Spirit you are of
[2:16:20] we're to love our
[2:16:21] enemies not tolerate
[2:16:24] love and I'm going to confess something
[2:16:27] I have found it easier to love my
[2:16:30] enemies and people out in the world than
[2:16:33] people in the message that don't see it
[2:16:36] just the way I
[2:16:37] do that sounds silly but it's the truth
[2:16:41] amen because somebody's maybe so far
[2:16:44] this way say okay I have Grace for them
[2:16:46] I realize that but this guy he ought to
[2:16:48] know better and he ought to see it my
[2:16:49] way and the
[2:16:51] Lord why is it so hard for me to love my
[2:16:54] brother that might have just a little
[2:16:55] difference here little difference there
[2:16:56] whatever it is Lord forgive me amen and
[2:16:59] I draw a barrier there I want to break
[2:17:01] that down now we're come to our
[2:17:04] conclusion real quick John trying to cap
[2:17:06] it said oh keep Christ the unity of
[2:17:08] Christ the love of God in our hearts
[2:17:10] little children love one another I
[2:17:12] believe we have to go through these
[2:17:16] things we've and going through it I
[2:17:18] believe we have to go through these
[2:17:20] things before we can really see the real
[2:17:23] meaning of them if I had not gone
[2:17:26] through those things and then come out
[2:17:27] and realize oh my goodness look at me
[2:17:30] look what I am look where I've been
[2:17:31] going Lord I have missed your
[2:17:34] focus if I hadn't gone through that I
[2:17:37] wouldn't see it the way that I'm able to
[2:17:38] see it now and I want to see it Greater
[2:17:41] I know there's more that I don't see but
[2:17:43] he say I believe we have to go through
[2:17:44] these things before we can really see
[2:17:46] the real meaning of them John was the
[2:17:49] one who wanted to call fire down out of
[2:17:50] Heaven burn up Samaria that day because
[2:17:52] they wouldn't give him something to eat
[2:17:53] the same one become the very funnel of
[2:17:56] love and I want to leave you with this
[2:17:59] phrase here and I'd like to sing that
[2:18:01] song before I just turn the service back
[2:18:02] I'd like to sing one of them with
[2:18:04] musicians or whoever wants to
[2:18:06] come he says I wonder
[2:18:09] Brethren if someday when all of our
[2:18:12] differences when we really see the
[2:18:14] vision that God is trying to get before
[2:18:15] us if it just won't break us right down
[2:18:19] at one another's feet
[2:18:21] amen
[2:18:23] oh that hits home makes me feel like
[2:18:28] that all these differences that I've
[2:18:31] been standing for
[2:18:34] championing putting them down building
[2:18:36] this up when you really see it from
[2:18:39] Christ's
[2:18:42] eyes forgive me brother amen Forgive Me
[2:18:46] Lord break us right down at one
[2:18:49] another's feet that's that unifying
[2:18:51] thing that they went through in the
[2:18:53] upper room that's what brought the unity
[2:18:55] of Christ in that day and I believe
[2:18:57] that's the very thing that that every
[2:18:59] one of his children need to go through
[2:19:00] that kind of a of an
[2:19:02] experience we're going through things
[2:19:04] right now it's going to come everything
[2:19:06] works together for the
[2:19:09] good I'm not here
[2:19:12] scolding I'm just telling you the
[2:19:15] testimony of what God has done in my
[2:19:17] life
[2:19:18] and in my circles that I'm walking in
[2:19:21] where the barriers were trying to break
[2:19:23] them down and it's marvelous the
[2:19:25] fellowship that God has blessed us with
[2:19:28] good friends that never would have been
[2:19:30] friends they would have been tolerated
[2:19:33] acquaintances but now I love them and we
[2:19:37] have Fellowship there's one brother up
[2:19:38] there that it's probably one of my
[2:19:40] closest friends and we get into the word
[2:19:42] and it's just like did you know a oh my
[2:19:45] goodness you know what and then there's
[2:19:46] B it follows a yes oh yes do and see and
[2:19:48] just together we're both we have all
[2:19:51] these pieces but fellowshipping with him
[2:19:53] it just it comes in I wouldn't have that
[2:19:55] Fellowship cuz he was one that I was it
[2:19:57] was outside my
[2:19:59] circles I think
[2:20:01] Lord what would I have been
[2:20:04] missing but now when I can see the road
[2:20:09] that I've been
[2:20:10] walking and the consequences of it and I
[2:20:12] realize what's at stake it's the burden
[2:20:15] of my heart to spread this wherever I
[2:20:20] can I know we're all believers I know we
[2:20:23] love the Lord we've been born again now
[2:20:26] let's walk worthy of the vocation where
[2:20:28] with we've been
[2:20:29] called with loneliness meekness
[2:20:32] longsuffering forbearing one another
[2:20:34] love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[2:20:37] the spirit God gave it to
[2:20:39] us and so I've got to be meek and lowly
[2:20:43] and
[2:20:45] humble space for my brother with his
[2:20:47] belief pray for one another he might
[2:20:49] have something that I
[2:20:54] need take what they say well Lord go
[2:20:58] through and search the scriptures prove
[2:21:00] all things hold that which is good
[2:21:04] amen oh I wouldn't take something from
[2:21:06] that guy you know what God used a
[2:21:13] donkey at any rate I just want to say
[2:21:15] this we love you we really do in a way
[2:21:19] that I could never say that
[2:21:22] before I appreciate the fellowship the
[2:21:24] friendship that God has given us brother
[2:21:26] Ron it's been a privilege through the
[2:21:28] years and I have not always walked
[2:21:31] worthy of the location where I've been
[2:21:35] called and you know there were
[2:21:37] some there were some that I looked down
[2:21:40] on up there in
[2:21:42] Canada and they would come to our
[2:21:45] camp I thought why would they come to
[2:21:48] our camp they don't believe like us well
[2:21:51] yeah maybe they'll get the truth because
[2:21:52] they're coming and they came year after
[2:21:55] year after year and all of a sudden I
[2:21:56] thought my goodness that was real love
[2:21:59] that was real Fellowship I says Lord I
[2:22:02] couldn't have done that I should have
[2:22:04] done that and so now we have Fellowship
[2:22:07] back and forth all the churches at
[2:22:08] special meetings we do all we can I
[2:22:10] might well of course we don't agree with
[2:22:13] one another on every detail but that
[2:22:15] doesn't matter amen we are brothers and
[2:22:17] sisters in the Lord that's the unity of
[2:22:19] the spirit may God help us to keep that
[2:22:23] and I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[2:22:25] of them amen that's what he gave us amen
[2:22:28] let's sing that we'll let you go in
[2:22:29] Jesus

[2:22:34] them I'm one of
[2:22:37] them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
