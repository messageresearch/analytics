let's just go direct to the word we've got quite a bit on our plate tonight so um yeah praise the Lord um yeah both of those songs speci Brother Andy revas God bless you uh he'll do it again we believe that God is the same yesterday today and forever Maas God bless you it's good to have you here um and uh each and everyone and David and Anita it's good to have you guys here and uh Lord willing we'll have some time to get together I'm getting with maias tomorrow morning early for breakfast and and uh praise the Lord now last Sunday I preached on stepping into the vision and uh we had quite a time with a Brothers on Monday morning listen I got there just five minutes before 7 they already had they had quotes out they were underlining they were hammering the table these guys were were yeah they were ready to go and it was a quite a blessing then I thought well you know what I wanted to do is just to kind of take that a little bit further and uh I wanted to show you in the scripture of that event actually happening so I want you to turn with me if you would in your Bibles a little lengthy reading but that's good uh Genesis chap 24 Genesis chapter 24 and I wanted to say until U sister Melody Weeden and Angela that their Brother David got with me yesterday the Lord uh uh he he said brother Ron this is the little red-haired boy of uh the youngest son of of James and and Melody and and I've got some questions and I said oh well hey praise the Lord and he said look I don't want to debate I don't want an argument or anything like that and I said hey look uh if you've got questions we come here I'm not a theologian he because he asked me what did you go to a School of Theology and I said no I went to a school of neology and I said listen um you know uh I'm not an answer man but I said if you have a question um that actually comes from the scripture because I said let's let's if we're going to talk about something I said the word of God let's establish one thing and that is God's word is our absolute I said because a prophet comes back and reveals to you the things from the word that's right okay so I said if it's uh you know just Theology and you want to know you know is Buddha God is Islam right you know who's right and everything hey uh you know we're not and anyway had a wonderful time amen wonderful time prise God and just going back to the scripture and I told him now here's here's uh what I realized and he said well brother Ron I was raised up in your church I the little boy and I was I was the star of your uh play Joseph and I played Joseph and everything and I was there and I says but all these years if you're going because I asked when did you quit going to church he said well about 13 14 I just quit it's you know he said I'd rather stay home and play and I I you know and so I said we've been raised around the message now here's what I'm going to say to you young men you've been raised around the message but I want you to get into it okay cuz you can be raised around it and it's just religion that's right I don't want you to just have a religion I want you to know from the Bible and I had told uh I told David I said David here's an app where you can go if you want to see I says go you know cuz he's a tech guy and I said go here and download the table and I said then you can research it yourself and uh I think that's good and I want all and I'm just going to put it out here to our young people I want you to have just like you should have your own Bible I want you to get your own message books your own Seven Seals your own church age book and you start reading and understanding this for yourself amen amen don't let it be just well Mom and Dad and you know I went there because they made me and you know uh but I thank God if I told David I said if you if you're sincere and you really want to know ask God and I says and then you've got Bible questions you just write them down we'll get together so I'm excited about that I told him and and we had a big time he's a big smile and he said I'm the little red-haired boy you know but when I saw him he ain't no Little red-haired boy he's big and you know so anyway had a very nice time and so uh sister Melody and Angela was a very nice time with him and I I trust that it all went well Genesis 24 Genesis 24: um 1-15 and Abraham was old and well stricken in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that rule over all that he had put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and I will make thee swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the Earth Earth that thou shalt take a w Thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of Canaanites among whom I dwell but Thou shalt go unto my country and to my Kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac and the servant said unto him per Adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me into this land must I needs bring thy son again into the land from whence thou camest and Abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again and the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my Kindred and which spake unto me and that swear unto me saying unto thy seed will I give this land he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from then and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then and thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither again and the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swear to him concerning that matter and the servant took 10 camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to Mesopotamia under the city of nahor and he made his camels to kneel down without the City by a well of water at the time of the evening my goodness even the time that women go out to draw water and he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham I pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master Master Abraham behold I stand Here by a well of water and the daughters of men of the City come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy camels drink also do you know how much 10 camels will will drink amen we're not talking 10 horses and horses would drink a lot but 10 camels okay and let her say I will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou Hast appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby I shall know that th showed kindness unto my master and it came to pass before he had done speak speaking then behold Rebecca came out and was born to Bethel the son of milka the wife of neor Abraham's brother and her picture upon her shoulder he spoke the vision amen he prayed yes he asked God for kindness and good speed and Rebecca stepped into the vision amen father God I thank you for Thy word oh God I'm excited to look and see father that while a servant is yet praying steps in a woman unaware of what she's doing but she's answering the prayer of God's messenger I pray heavenly father that thou will bless Thy word to our heart tonight each and everyone open unto us the scriptures that we might see you more clearly we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you you can be seated this evening in the presence of God Amen I titled this uh sermon when the bride steps into the spoken word Vision when the bride steps into the spoken word Vision because here's the messenger want you to understand a message from God is actually God's Vision a prophet like an un a SE or Seas things and what he does he's he's like the Watchman in the tower or on the wall watch and what of the night he sees things in their embryonic form he sees them a far off and and so when prophets speak they're speaking what they're seeing amen it's why God speaks to them if they are spiritual or they're a prophet I will speak unto them in visions and in dreams and so we see that a Prophet this ministry of brother brandham is not just Creeds and dogmas and rules and regulations it's actually a v ision so you're understanding all of you this connection that you have with this message and the uh this pulling that you have towards it this Destiny if you please that's pulling you towards it is actually showing you that you're part of the vision the Lord understand that okay uh God is not known by science he's not known by education he's known by Revelation and Revelation is given sovereignly he doesn't give it to everyone okay you can study the word and still not know God you can know Creeds and dogmas and and the precepts from God's word you can be a Pharisee and concerning the law blameless you can be a moral person but it that doesn't give you eternal life eternal life is when God shares with you his logos thought and that logos thought is God showing you where you were in the beginning and I want to take uh the subject the bride uh has made herself ready but I want to reword this a little bit and I want to say the bride has closed herself in the messengers garments because you will see that is when he sees her coming he knows that must be his bride why she's dressed in the garments that he gave eler amen all right so I just want to share with you because these types and shadows are quite exciting when you look through the word of God and then you see even as uh Andy revas was singing that song God can do it again we understand brother Brenham said that God is Hebrews 13 and8 he's the same yesterday today and forever so he says I the Lord God Chang not so what he's done in the past he'll do again and if you understand uh uh that when God begins to give a vision by the way of a prophet and you begin to uh have an affinity uh a pulling towards this actually what it is is you are becoming a part of the vision you're entering into it you're stepping into it when you agree with it and say I believe it what you're doing you're actually entering into the vision no different than Rebecca when uh when she came listen eler has just prayed and while he was just finishing his prayer amen we see Rebecca comes into the scene she is a spoken word bride Hallelujah she is there because she is actually prophecy being fulfilled she's the words of eler in manifestation do you understand she doesn't know it little did you know it when this message came across you you didn't know it you didn't know you were predestinated you didn't know you were ordained but there was something attracting you and when you heard this there was something that said no man spake like this man amen amen so you see uh um when you have a prophet and he speaks in the name of the Lord things don't automatically let go and become better right you remember when uh in the first Exodus and every time that Moses would say thus sayith the Lord let my people go what happened it got worse until finally Moses comes before God and he says wherefore hast thou sent me seeing thou Hast not delivered your people all you send me I spoke it and it's worse so understand things sometimes get worse before they get better I was in the back room telling the brothers my computer today went crazy I couldn't get it to work couldn't this and that and I and and you know where is Matthew yeski when I need him he you know and I can't even get it I I can't even get on in anyway I just you know know and then Zachary comes in I said man I had a rough day you know my computer he said well my car got stolen oh your car get St yeah uh yeah not only that my AC quit in my house oh wow uh and not only that my two and 3 and 1/2 ton dump trailer the axle got uh bent and uh he just keeps going on he's on a roll he you know and I said my computer's not so bad I don't have no problems compared to Zach you know and so anyway sometimes you need somebody put you in a little perspective and so he put me in perspective now listen God does not come according to your understanding he comes according to his word and after the word is revealed and he makes you understand this is the word coming to pass then your eyes become open and you recognize that it's God doing the work okay now uh even after all of God's Vindicated signs and after all the Wonders and after destroying Pharaoh's Army and the plagues and on and on we could rehearse all of that understand and they did the brass Serpent and everything and and opening the Red Sea you would have thought that everybody was convinced and nobody would come against Moses man if if I saw stand and see the glory of God man I'm never going to make that guy mad at me that's God's man anyway the Bible says in Hebrews 4 1 and 2 let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest and any of you should ever come short of it for unto us was the Gospel preached somebody say amen amen we've heard the gospel you've been in church how long does God how many sermons do you have to hear you see it's just line upon line precept upon precept show us the father how long have you been with me Jesus said that if you've seen the father you've sent me because I and my father are one so I want you to understand For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so it's not well I went to church I was there as a young boy I raised up and there yeah but what did you hear you didn't hardly hear anything you it was just a social Gathering God help us and with our children this is not a little social Gathering we're to get into something and understand this is a this is you know even as I told David I said David per Adventure just listen to this if God sent a prophet in this end time if God sends a messenger he's doing it because he said well who's right who has truth you know and I began to quote the scriptures I am the way the truth and the life and even Pontius Pilate said what is truth I said we didn't know and you and I inclusive did not know real truth until a prophet came and returned our faith back to the Faith of Our Fathers so that we could understand now what good is it to hear all these sermons and not have every sermon mixed with faith and Faith being a revelation so we don't want to we don't want to be those that have just heard and then be a forgetful hearer we want to get into this message brother Braham said don't talk about it let's get into it and so a lot of times you see that what happens is there might be somebody within the message perhaps a person of influence a minister a prominent man or somebody and the next thing you know even and I just give you an example even those who um started this believe the sign I was there before they launched it I was in the office of brother bisc he said a brother in my church has worked for a couple years now a year and a half I believe he and his son and we want to show you CU we're going to launch this and I I yeah okay sat there and so they got it computerized put it on the Monitor and believe the sign and this and that this sign in the Supernatural and over here when they got done uh uh brother bcll said and you know he's such a gentleman uh and he says so brother Ron what do you think and I said well I I says excuse me and I'm not you know and and really I don't know why you ask me I said because it really doesn't matter but I said I want to ask you all of these signs which one of them made you a Believer which was it the pillar of fire was it the cloud which sign was it the Miracles and you said oh now now I saw the cloud and God revealed to me and now I'm a Believer which sign made you a Believer I said listen we're not following signs we follow the word and I said signs follow us you understand and I said look even though God even as I shared with David Weeden I said God can do Supernatural things in front of people where they know they can say oh man thou uh this man is a man sent from God cuz no man could do these things except that God be with him and I said no matter how much it was proven before the people there are still doubters and unbelievers that's right okay so not everyone's going to believe but you will believe why because it's revealed to you that's why you follow it because you got Revelation because if you just have religion then somebody comes along with maybe a a better um let's say a way to explain religion you know like that well how do you know there is a God I think man invented a God and he said wow what a what a a nice programmed to just invent a God and tell the people and then they all conform to it you know that's that's theology well listen uh God was not invented he was and I said isn't it amazing that through science and wisdom man doesn't know God and I said they broke into brother BR said they broke into God's Great laboratory and they're discovering things DNA and all this kind of stuff but that'll never prove God I said it for without faith it's impossible right to believe and to love God or to have faith in you so God has to give you a Measure of Faith which that's a gift to God for you to believe amen amen so there are different ones that rise up and maybe they pull off a group of people and they they go off and the next thing you know there's a tangent a breakaway group and what happens to them eventually what they're doing is taking away from from the message and then they take away from the Bible because really the intent is to take you away from the revealed word of the hour you understand that they're actually not getting at brother Brenham they're getting at the god of brother Brenham they're getting at the Christ of God you understand that okay so even among all of the things let me give you an example of that found in Numbers chapter 16 now Kora and the son of ishar and the son of Kath and the son of Levi and Dayan and Abram and the sons of eliab and on and the son of palath and the sons of Reuben took men watch this and they rose up therefore before Moses and certain of the children of Israel 200 150 princes of the assembly the Bible says famous in the congregation men of renown so somehow these guys got men who had influence and were looked up in the congregation is that right that's what your Bible says and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said unto them you take too much unto you seeing all the congregation Are Holy every one of them and the Lord is among them therefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord you see what I'm saying God rose up Moses it wasn't Moses he was the meest of of all men that's what the Bible says but anyway I want you to understand no matter how Vindicated of God you're always going to have somebody here's daythan and Kora that rise up now this is not Janice and jambur back in denomination this is Dayan and Kora Who come out under the signs Who come out who seen all the Supernatural and now they rise up against Moses right and it's not really Moses it's like the people when they rejected Samuel Samuel got despondent and said they've rejected me and God told him it's not you Samuel they rejecting that's right they're rejecting me and and and look even Moses goes away for a few days on the mount and Aaron the high priest what does he do the people put pressure on him so he builds a golden cat oh my next thing you know there's dancing and ring and we got this Revelation Hallelujah and got all the people all excited and there was all kinds of anointing and when Moses came down Joshua was waiting there right and he says oh my I hear the sound of war in the camp what did Moses say it's not war it's frolly it's reving you see a wrong Revelation can cause you to get so stimulated you'll think Hey listen false Revelation false wine is as toxic as real wine okay so we never judge something by its anointing right okay but we judge it by the word because brother Bram said look one of the closest lies is 99% the truth it's just the changing of one word that can that can bring an outcome and bring bring forth death now so understand if you guys remember the time that David was wanting to bring the ark back into um Israel right and he got so excited Here Comes The Ark and he's dancing until his Ro falls off and he's all excited they've got trumpets they've got all of the everybody and they're out there and it's a big procession and here comes the an ox cart with the Ark on an ox cart now remember it was never to be placed on an ox cart okay what was wrong it was always to be carried over the shoulders of the Levites but what happened The Oxen stumbled there was a a dip in the road The Oxen stumbled and the arc w faed and it says and usua put his hand to the ark that it might not fall well that that's good thank you USA but he touched the ark and what happened the anger of God slew him now if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and God changes not brother Brenham said to put your hand to the ark or the word of God today without a calling in your life brings forth death spiritual death death to the people okay so let let's go back to the scripture here or look let let me show you um okay I I I'm not going to read the part from the India report we're going to go down um remember now I read to you Genesis 24: 11-13 I'm going to go over that again with you and he made his camels to kneel down without the City by a well of water at the time of the evenings so now we we understand it's evening time he sent with a message and his message is to go get a bride for Isaac is that right okay so let's be spiritual about this he's there as a messenger and he says I'm looking for character and he said I'm at a well and you know what God does many things in scriptures at Wells there was a woman at the well all kinds of things so I'm not going to go into that and if you're going to catch fish you go where fish are caught amen and so here is a woman okay and he is saying hey Lord I don't want to be here for too long I don't want to waste my time and waste my Master's money because he gave me goods and go there and find my son a bride and so he says all right Lord let's cut to the chase I'm here there's a well and all these women are coming but I want you father to have the one I will say unto her give me to drink and she will say to me so now he's rehearsing a vision he's speaking it are you understanding this he's speaking this of what this bride is going to be like her character what she will say at his messy amen so they he says now she will say I will not only give you a drink but I will now water your camels and he says and then I will know because what he's doing here's there's all kinds of women but this woman steps into the vision she's a spoken word bride she's there because he spoke it do you realize her whole life she was birthed her father her mother this and that I don't know how old she was but here she is and she's coming with a picture and you understand she's she's there just like any other day to get water amen but she meets a messenger and he speaks something she speaks back and her very words are causing her to step into the vision amen prise the Lorden so God does things that Wells I love to look at that um eler here now we all understand he's on a Divine Mission I want you to put your hand on your your my thigh and swear by the god of Heaven and the god of Earth take not a woman of Canaan I want you to go to my message people and message Believers because under no circumstance do I want my son to marry an unbeliever somebody say Amen I'm paraphrasing that but that's basically what he said I don't want a woman of Canaan I don't want the some Jezebel from the land of which we live in I want you to go to message Believers and it isn't it amazing that he's going to even Abraham's brother and he finds a woman here she is she's answering the very very prayer that he's been praying now he's there to find a bride for Rising chapter 24 verse1 14 and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray thee that I may drink she will say drink and I will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou Hast appointed understand she's appointed to this that's right do you realize she is appointed to receive this messenger so may I put it on you for a moment you were appointed you were actually predestinated this was for you you were appointed because God keeps all of his appointments and just like zakus up in the tree or blind Bemus any one of them hey this day I've got an appointment when you came across this message you know what it was you were appointed to it praise the Lord you didn't know it but you were appointed to it you were elected by God eler is asking God to give him favor and so her response to his request is assigned to elaser that's right when brother Bren preaches sermons like choosing a bride and he talks about character he says when the woman responds to what I'm saying he says I'll know that's the one now I believe sister Barker was telling us she was there and sister Nancy Patterson and sister Barker they were both there in Los Angeles when brother brandham spoke choosing a bride if I remember correctly and I like to have her tell the test morning sometime there was people there that during the service of brother Brenan preaching choosing a bride were so offended they said this sermon is vulgar and they walked out and they said it's horrible could you imagine a man preaching like that look this cow in the eye and he makes comparisons and and said oh I've never oh it was offensive it was vulgar and I believe uh that they took this tape and gave it to someone else and the Very on that said it was vulgar and had walked out the other said I found nothing offensive in fact I was responding amen do you understand when eler is coming and he's preaching his message and he's speaking these words your response to it is what he says that's the one appointed Hallelujah that's why you can say or he can say as I preach the message I'm actually he says I don't tell them everything I say just enough of the word and during that third pole if they catch it see what is it it's the word that caught you wasn't the message the the message is Christ that's what caught you and he says all that the father hath given me what will come to me and I haven't lost one of them that's right so once you're caught you're caught and I've often told you and listen God is the greatest fisherman once you're hooked you're hooked you can fight all you want in fact a fisherman loves a good fight amen you know John dubsky loves when he gets a big one oo oo yeah come on baby come on look at oh look at this one you know uh menop freezen does the same thing when he's gone oh he his pole will go down like this oh brother Ron look at that this a big one this a big one oh big then then he gets it up oh no maybe it's not so big oh yeah he's a big one he's a big I want you to understand I don't care how much you fight once you swallow the this thing hooked line in Sinker and God's got you hooked you can run baby you can try to fight it but you know what you can't get loose Lord the TR amen I'm not looking for a way out I'm looking for a way in Hallelujah and when I'm hooked oh yeah I've been offended by people within the message who hasn't right listen if you ain't been around long enough there'll be somebody that's going to lock horns with you and well if that's what message believers do ain't got nothing to do with the message it's just part of the family and family have sibling rivalry do any of your kids fight huh Mom Mom he's touching me it's so funny cuz we had a Volkswagen van our kidss they had plenty of room to play in the back of the van they were the seat belts car seats are you kidding me they played wherever they wanted make faces to the people and in the back but anyway they're around and Rebecca go uh mom mom Matthew's touching me again like okay she'd take off her shoe and she try and you know they're dodging her trying and sibling rivalry it's a it's amazing Brothers to Brothers sister brother it's just it's just part of the thing you know what what you do is eventually if you create the right kind of atmosphere okay and tell them hey no we're my parents they hated my brother and I fighting so much finally they bought us boxing gloves they took all of the furniture moved everything around made us put the box now smack that dude hit him that's hard I don't I said hit him I mean when we're in the back room like this quit making sounds we don't want to get caught like this we're fight they finally okay we're done with it he bought boxing gloves put them on all right you guys want to fight get in here fight fight till you knock the other guy down oh man we both started crying I don't want to fight it's my brother maybe we ought to get some of these guys boxing gloves and tell them all right just duke it out that no really no we don't want to do that but I'm just saying that that sibling rivalry you have it brother sister whatever uh it's just as you get older and I remember my my last fight with my twin brother because I grew up with a a sparring partner and we were having a and it's always over something stupid it's nothing major we're in the car we got a little Volkswagen Bug we got the little emergency break or the handbrake right in the center you know right near the stick shift my brother's driving I got so upset I just grabbed that brake this car like that Mitch Buckingham's in the car with us we get out in the middle of the road all right man like this a goes come on come on you guys are crazy stop this like this so my brother goes and he hits Mitch right in the CH okay go ahead kill one another I don't care and so my brother and I like this I get him in the headlock like this and he's hitting me in the back with a kidney punch I'm saying stop stop and I started crying I said I don't want to hurt you stop I'm I'm going to get you like this stop and I I said look and I I made a promise right then I told my brother I called him brv I said' brv I'm never going to fight you again never the rest of my life because you're my brother I won't fight you and I let him go and I actually had to run because you did that stop him are you you chicken come here I'm yeah but you know what so when you see when eler sees the response of Rebecca he knows that's her now I want you to see why we are not a denomination brother Ram says this did you notice Rebecca when Ellie eer found her it was in the evening time and she watered the camel because El eer he then quotes what he said and while he was yet in prayer Rebecca come and draw water and give him a drink and watered the camel notice the camel was a beast and that same Beast that she was watering was the one who packed her to the bride Isaac I want you to understand that this message as you water it it's packing you it's taking you to Isaac Hallelujah I just love that amen see brother Brown said there's a deep calling to the Deep therefore there's a deep inside of you to respond now we don't talk you into this right you know I visited with a young brother here not long ago and he was giv me every excuse he said well I've been raised up around this and I've prayed and it's never worked for me and I just don't know I said I believe that you are a son of God predestinated well it's not revealed to me and so the more that I would try to encourage him he would throw it back to me it just doesn't work I don't even pray anymore I don't even read my Bible I I just you know and I so after so much I said well maybe you're not I said if you're not you're not maybe you are serpent seed I mean come on let's be real honest yeah you your by your your voice or what you're saying you know God has never answered you and this and I said well maybe maybe you are serpent SE so go be about your father's business don't don't go to church don't pray don't because you know what he's not your God and uh so you know just uh here about 10 days ago or so we had a nice visit and he said I think there was a miscommunication I said I there was no miscommunication I know what you're saying he said well you know God you know and I said are you praying no are you reading no I said do your first works I said be not deceived be not deceived come on now God is Not mocked whatsoever you sow that shall you reap if you reap if you sow to the flesh you shall of the flesh what reap corruption so I said look God don't play games I said listen I'm not asking you to read five chapters of your Bible every morning I says read a couple verses I don't care get in there and pray and say father I don't I don't know you're you're a a mystical God I need you to come to me my name is Jacob and when Jacob is left alone that's when God spoke to him sometimes God has got to get you a alone so he can shake your tree and get you to the place see uh bethl experiences he saw angels ascending and descending what was it House of God that's bethl he saw it he was excited didn't change his life what changed the life of of Jacob is he comes to a place called pineal where I meet God face to face and you wrestle with him and I'm telling you that's what every one of you and you young people understand this there'll come a time in your life when you're going to say you know I like Jacob did I know my grandfather told me my grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac and they told me all these things and Supernatural and mezic and all the stories and they're wonderful but but Jacob when he prays I pray to the god of Abraham and to the god of Jacob but it was wasn't his God it wasn't revealed to him yet but when he got to a place and here's where each one of us have got to have your penal exerience with God and that is you wrestle with this you do you wrestle how how badly do you want a blessing from God right well I'm going through a few trials and you know well if God's going to if I'm predestin n you ain't even wanting to fight for it cuz anything in life if it's worth anything you're going to have to work for it or you're going to have to fight for it come on now somebody say Amen if you're happy to just dig ditches for 10 bucks an hour go for it see what I'm saying don't lower your standard raise the standard and bring the child to the standard amen so brother Bram says in a time of decision he says and notice the sermon time at a time of decision she thought she was okay I'll give you water and I'll Water your camels so it's a decision time so as elar believed and committed himself to God then they could have searched the world over they could have combed through every city went to every house and could have never found a better mate for Isaac than Rebecca was see it's the old Wesley and Methodist ritual as Isaac and Rebecca lived happily uh together uh may this couple they were sweethearts it was a type of Christ and the church you see it was the spirit of God leading elaser to pray that prayer and it was the spirit leading she didn't know it wasn't revealed to her right then but she was going to get water she's going into a vision and when she drops into his vision the messenger and she speaks she's stepping into the vision now it's a sign to elaser that's the one God has given me favor and he knew right away so again let's go to this uh same sermon spoke in Los Angeles Isaac was a type of Christ through Isaac come Christ and then Rebecca was a type of the church did you notice the bride elazer found Rebecca in the evening time the sign was performed in the evening time that's the time we're living in I trust you get this amen it was in the evening time that Rebecca came out led by the spirit do you believe that amen he say she was led by the spirit in the evening time and elaser the messenger the minister the true servant to his master was led in the evening time and the true servant had left his Creeds and things behind him and made up his Min he was going to trust God in the evening time amen oh my Hallelujah now here's another thing that I found in the scriptures there in Genesis 24 and verses 26 through3 but I'm just going to read verses 29 onward and Rebecca had a brother and his name was laan and laan ran out unto the man unto the well and it came to pass when he saw the earrings and bracelets upon his sister's hands when he heard the words of Rebecca her sister saying thus spake the man unto me that he came unto the man and behold he stood by the camels at the well I want you to understand he's looking she's already got gifts she's so excited about this man that she's met how many of you have said hey come see a man I'm telling nobody like the woman at the well who said come see a man who's told me all these things and the Holy Spirit is looking for a response from her but when she spoke it do you realize she's activating a faith inside of her and now she's being quickened she's going right into the uh uh she's going into the vision she's stepping into it so I'm just going to skip some of this tonight because here we are 10 to N I want you to understand okay here is the end time evangelism let's go to this quote end time evangelism he says the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture amen sir that's what it's for it's not just church order it's to get you ready for a [Music] Rapture what can it do according to Malachi 4 is bring them back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints bring them back to the faith of the fathers the Pentecostal part in the restoration time I will restore sayith the Lord that's the real event end time evangelism that's the name of his sermon he said here's here's real end time evangelism you know what it is it's my message because I'm a messenger and I'm speaking to you this message because it's to get a bride ready how many of you believe that this is a divinely inspired message okay and you have an understanding that God sent a messenger and he spoke these sermons and it was for a purpose that those the the bride the Rebecca of the hour is going to catch this and she's going to have an understanding okay it's not all revealed to her at once no she's just for some reason okay she's met this man at a well and he's told her some things and gave her some gifts and she's all excited and she tells her brother laan and laan can see by the gifts she's got and by the excitement in her voice wow I better go check this guy out okay is this guy a scam artist what did he do he did he uh bewitch you of some sort what did he do what you know people when you come to this message and you forsaken everything look my mother was all for education education son if you're going to do anything in this you got to get an education so I got good grades in High School got a four-year scholarship San Diego State University okay and uh when I came to this message I gave up my scholarship I went my first year I did well in school I enjoyed College I did University I loved

Manson family she helped kill Sharon Tate Lanka and all of that and they wanted to create a race war anyway so it was big news to our city Monrovia High School and to our city and so oh they're all they put swastikas on their forehead they sang songs they chanted and they believed that Charles Manson was some kind of Guru leader right and so they all followed him he he Bewitched them all so my

spiritual and I wrote hey Mom we're up here in Oregon and you know Mom God's going to destroy this world and and the prophet said this and you know and I'm I'm thinking she's going to look at this and read it and say yes you're right son hey have any of you witnessed with all kinds of zeal and no wisdom have you ever grabbed somebody and tried to shake them hey come on man why can't you see it and man I see it just as plain as anything why can't you see it well Hey listen you can't talk about into it and once you're in it nobody can talk you out of it so anyway uh in Redemption by judgment this is my last quote here um I might read read one more I'm not going to lie uh musicians have you come Redemption by judgment 1954 the beautiful story of Rebecca and how that she got on the camel and went to meet Isaac with elzer and Isaac being the type of Christ the son of God which he was the son of Abraham who fell heir to all of Abraham's goods and all that he had he was out in the field in the evening time wandering around in the field and when she saw the Bea when he saw the beautiful Rebecca coming on the camel oh my that just makes chills go through me the beautiful Rebecca I'd never he'd never seen her he never knew who she was but eler was hunting her up and he found her by witness of the Holy Spirit excuse me and he prayed said God give me favor today that I might find a wife for my master and Rebecca came to the water to water the camels which was the sign that she was willing to go you see when you water this message when you say I believe it and and yes yeah hey you're watering the very thing she's she's she's being willing do you know all of you have to do the same thing you've got to be willing to say you know what I I will water this message am amen she was willing to go got on the camel and went to meet she was willing we've got to be willing [Music] also he gave gifts to the family but she wanted the giver amenallah remember the family was accepting of the gifts like Pentecost they want the gifts but they rejected the word Rebecca not only wanted a few little gifts but she wanted I fell in love with him because eler told the story of Isaac so well I've never seen Isaac but I love him amen I've never seen God but I love you why because eler no man spake like him this message that's why put those tapes on listen to them amen in the cool of the evening it doesn't replace going to church no doesn't replace going to church but as you want to study and hear a real eler talk about about Isaac put a tape on and listen to what he says amen he says I'm going to paraphrase a few things right now he said if I can get her attention and I can get her to stand still long enough I'll dress her with the [Music] word so the bride is being dressed by the messenger's message amen the same as Esther knew what the king would like because she was told by the Chamberlain amen this is the Ty type woman and all the other women they all dressed up real fancy and tried to be you know the most beautiful they could but Esther just wore the things that the King when he looked at he said oh that's what I'm looking for brother Brenham did not come to look for beauty he looked for character amen he said Beauty to young girls in this last [Music] day it's going to be a real trial and he says and it it can be a real real trial because the beauty of women remember it's one of the signs of the end time the beauty of women the increase of beauty is a sign the end is near yes not a Max Factor and lipstick and the eyelashes you seen these women with these big eyelashes okay and then they put all the lipstick on then they got a ring through the nose through the ear here and the other day they got one's got two big old things right through the lips wow

God help us and you sisters God's looking for character not not Beauty he said don't take your beauty out of Hollywood take it out of the holy word am amen I'm thankful that I've heard a messenger in
