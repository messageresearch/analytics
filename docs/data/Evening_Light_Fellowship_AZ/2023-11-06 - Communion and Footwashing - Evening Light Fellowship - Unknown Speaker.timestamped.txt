[33:29] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[33:31] Lord we're having uh communion and foot
[33:34] washing tonight you know prophet of God
[33:38] said that Jesus left us three
[33:41] ordinances not three
[33:44] suggestions three
[33:46] ordinances you do this until I come is
[33:50] that right amen so it's extremely
[33:52] important this isn't something that we
[33:54] just well let's just throw it in there
[33:55] and and everything say no we we do it
[33:59] and I've always said that even on
[34:01] communion and foot washing it's always
[34:03] uh good to uh see as many as you can out
[34:07] to the house of God because it's a
[34:09] checks and balances it's a service where
[34:12] you have some retrospect you look at
[34:14] your own lives and and everything and uh
[34:17] so that's what we're doing this evening
[34:20] now uh wanted to make an announcement
[34:23] Wednesday um the 15th of this month
[34:26] Wednesday evening Andrew Glover will be
[34:29] here brother Andrew Glover uh we're
[34:31] having a tape service Sunday evening
[34:34] Sunday evening on um November
[34:40] 19th that's uh for those that want to
[34:43] make it I believe that uh it's very
[34:46] important that we get together we listen
[34:48] to it t because I'm convinced you're not
[34:51] listening
[34:55] enough amen
[34:57] amen I only heard this one or two David
[35:00] say Amen again amen
[35:02] amen somebody else say amen that's right
[35:06] that's right because there is one voice
[35:08] ordained of God in this day to turn your
[35:12] hearts back and Faith cometh by hearing
[35:15] hearing hearing the word word of God
[35:19] Amen you want more faith increase your
[35:22] hearing that's
[35:24] right amen all right so um now some are
[35:29] asking is this going to be the third
[35:32] Sunday of every month if we can schedule
[35:35] it yes if not we'll we'll announce it we
[35:38] may have to play with that uh you know
[35:41] depending on some of uh our trips and
[35:44] things I've been staying quite a bit
[35:46] home uh as you know and but here in
[35:49] November we're going to start doing some
[35:51] missionary work taking about uh five or
[35:54] six brothers with us to the country
[35:56] country of vatu and going to be there
[35:59] and having some uh Jubilee meetings with
[36:01] them and then we will be going January
[36:05] 2nd over to South Africa and be having a
[36:09] couple Services over there and brother
[36:11] dibl uh is getting married so we're
[36:14] going over there and we'll perform help
[36:17] uh perform the wedding over there in
[36:20] South
[36:21] Africa and uh just Rejoice with them uh
[36:25] so we'll look forward to that and uh I
[36:28] am not going to keep you too long
[36:31] tonight uh because it is communion and
[36:33] foot washing but uh I was prepared uh I
[36:38] had Plan B just in case his plane was a
[36:41] little bit late you know I'm always
[36:43] nervous and uh so uh I was so pleased
[36:47] how many of you really enjoyed the
[36:48] service this morning amen
[36:54] amen thank you Lord Brother Paul that
[36:58] was mature and wise that was good for
[37:02] every church and every Minister I think
[37:06] ministers should down and should sit
[37:09] down and listen to that because some of
[37:13] the
[37:15] worst
[37:17] examples of even brotherly kindness are
[37:19] the
[37:21] ministry because if you don't agree with
[37:23] him yeah out of
[37:25] here you know and and you know Hey
[37:28] listen we should have the closer that we
[37:31] get to God the less arrogant spirit amen
[37:35] the less selfish Spirit the less
[37:37] prideful you know the thing that
[37:39] impressed everybody about brother
[37:41] brandham was his humility right huh God
[37:45] help us to be humble and not proud and
[37:47] arrogant and stuffed shirts or anything
[37:50] like that but God just give us a greater
[37:53] portion of the Holy Ghost and that will
[37:55] cause us devour our heads in humility
[37:58] amen amen um I certainly appreciate even
[38:03] how you approached it started with uh a
[38:05] little bit of your background and your
[38:08] personal testimony showing you can be
[38:10] raised in the message you can have the
[38:12] head knowledge of it you can even agree
[38:15] that it's the word of God but
[38:18] until you catch your own personal
[38:21] revelation what it is is you're just
[38:23] kind of swept right along now that's
[38:25] okay heading on is okay but it'll only
[38:28] take you so far amen see that's why you
[38:30] need the new birth that's why the
[38:32] mystery of even what he was saying you
[38:34] see before they could fulfill the
[38:36] Commandment to go and multiply they
[38:39] fell so they were cast out of even Eden
[38:43] so they had to go forth and multiply in
[38:47] a uh Fallen
[38:49] state so Jesus then coming okay the
[38:53] great Boaz the great kinsman redeemer he
[38:55] comes and what he does what was his
[38:58] first doctrine that he taught you must
[39:01] be born again okay so then the new birth
[39:05] so he says so look it's not your natural
[39:08] birth okay he said it's to be born again
[39:11] that's why he told Nicodemus uh you know
[39:14] listen Nicodemus don't Marvel at this
[39:16] that a man must be born again but except
[39:18] a man be born again of the spirit he'll
[39:21] not see the kingdom of God he'll not
[39:23] understand his mind is
[39:25] carnal amen amen so um praise the Lord
[39:30] so I just certainly enjoyed that and if
[39:32] we have Unity of the
[39:34] spirit
[39:36] first and what Spirit not our spirit not
[39:39] a church Spirit not a pastor's Spirit
[39:42] not one another Spirit but his
[39:44] Spirit when we have Unity of that Spirit
[39:47] it will
[39:49] eventually eventually come to the unity
[39:51] of the faith and I I tell you I I don't
[39:54] think I've ever heard that quote where
[39:56] brother abam said Hey listen when we get
[39:58] over there and we see him face to a face
[40:01] then you and I will see I die
[40:04] amen
[40:07] hallelujah hey that's that's profound
[40:10] that's right so one says he's coming on
[40:12] a white horse and others coming on a
[40:14] white cloud and they disagree and have
[40:16] issues and separate brother BR says what
[40:19] does it matter as long as we agree he's
[40:20] coming amen amen amen so God give us the
[40:25] right kind of Spirit a spirit that's
[40:27] teachable amen because brother Bram said
[40:30] I'd rather have the right Spirit and the
[40:32] wrong
[40:32] Doctrine than I would to have the right
[40:35] Doctrine wrong Spirit God help us St
[40:38] John chapter 1 St John chapter 1 don't
[40:40] mean to keep you all standing too long
[40:42] thank you musicians God bless you guys
[40:45] certainly appreciate them appreciate the
[40:47] song special of the mon Menards and the
[40:50] family the
[40:55] children amen it's a family affair amen
[41:01] amen
[41:03] Amen brother Brown said that you're part
[41:06] of the family of God he took your
[41:09] picture before the foundation of the
[41:11] world he put it in his photo
[41:15] album Glory
[41:18] Hallelujah it's a family affair why he's
[41:23] your
[41:24] father St John chapter 1:
[41:28] 45 through
[41:32] 51 St John 1 verse 45 and Philip findeth
[41:37] Nathaniel saith unto him we have found
[41:40] him of whom Moses in the law and the
[41:43] prophets did right Jesus of Nazareth son
[41:47] of Joseph Nathaniel said unto him can
[41:51] there any good thing come out of
[41:54] Nazareth and Philip argued with him bent
[41:58] his arm no you know look be salty he
[42:03] said hey he said unto him come and see
[42:07] amen this is what we think it is you
[42:11] come and make up your mind and Jesus saw
[42:14] Nathaniel coming to him and saith of him
[42:17] behold an Israelite
[42:20] indeed in whom is no G I want to ask you
[42:23] which pull is that second pull
[42:26] discernment so now see he's he's already
[42:30] in the discernment phase of his ministry
[42:32] behold the Israelite in fact if you just
[42:35] go up a few verses before he he's
[42:37] talking to Peter Thou Art
[42:39] sephus okay and so you you begin to see
[42:43] the ministry of Christ and it gives us a
[42:47] pattern brother Bram said every great
[42:49] ministry within the word has three
[42:52] PS he said Moses had three PS Elijah had
[42:55] three PS okay and so this ministry in
[42:59] the end time typing that of Christ and
[43:01] of the prophets is going to have three
[43:03] plls also so he's in a second pull
[43:06] Nathaniel said unto him whence knowest
[43:09] thou
[43:10] me Jesus answered and said unto him
[43:14] before that Philip called thee when thou
[43:18] was under the Fig Tree I thought saw
[43:20] thee that's amazing he's seeing him
[43:24] under a fig tree I wonder what he was
[43:27] doing I'm sure that God was even aware
[43:31] of his thoughts
[43:33] amen and Nathaniel answered and said un
[43:35] him Rabbi Thou Art the Son of God Thou
[43:37] Art the king of
[43:40] Israel and Jesus entered and said unto
[43:42] him because I said unto thee I saw thee
[43:45] under the Fig Tree believest thou wow
[43:49] you you mean to tell me wow you're
[43:51] calling me the king of uh Israel You're
[43:54] a rabbi all of this wow you only saw the
[43:57] second
[43:58] pull because I told you this
[44:03] watch Thou shalt see greater
[44:07] things than these amen he's speaking of
[44:12] greater
[44:14] things and he saith unto him verily
[44:16] verily I say unto you
[44:18] Hereafter you shall see the heaven open
[44:22] and the angels of God ascending and
[44:24] descending upon on the son of man may
[44:28] God add the blessing to the word you can
[44:30] all be seated this evening in the
[44:32] presence of God somebody say amen amen
[44:36] glory turn with me if you would to St
[44:39] John 16 read two more scriptures here
[44:42] before we go on so we'll go to St John
[44:45] chapter 16 St John 16 verse 12-
[44:51] 16 now I want you to notice the words of
[44:54] Christ and and let's take notice of it I
[44:58] like to dissect things
[45:03] therefore hey I'm going to use that from
[45:06] now
[45:07] on because that was so good huh Warren
[45:10] did you like that yeah
[45:14] therefore yeah Hallelujah John 16
[45:18] verse2 I have yet many things to say
[45:20] unto
[45:21] you but ye cannot bear them now somebody
[45:25] say now now time is coming but you can't
[45:28] get it
[45:31] now how be it when he now notice he's
[45:34] going to he's going to let them know how
[45:37] be it when he the spirit of Truth is
[45:41] come he will guide you into all
[45:45] Truth for he shall not speak of himself
[45:49] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[45:52] he speak and he will show you things to
[45:57] come he shall glorify me for he shall
[46:01] receive of mine and shall show it unto
[46:05] you all things that the father hath are
[46:08] mine therefore said
[46:12] I that he shall take of mine and shall
[46:16] show it unto you a little while and ye
[46:19] shall not see me and again a little
[46:22] while and you shall see me because I go
[46:25] to the father amen I want you to take
[46:29] notice of verse 12 I have yet many
[46:32] things wow I want to share unto you the
[46:35] whole counsil of God but you
[46:40] can't understand it
[46:42] now why because there are
[46:45] degrees of our maturity and of our
[46:48] understanding the Apostle Paul said when
[46:50] I was a child I spake as a child I
[46:55] understood as a child huh I acted like a
[46:59] child but when I became a man so there
[47:02] came a time of M of spiritual maturity
[47:06] when I became a man I put away childish
[47:10] things if you take things away from
[47:13] immature Christians they'll resent you
[47:16] for
[47:18] it but you let them grow and
[47:22] mature huh you don't have to to uh you
[47:26] know have them all tow the line right
[47:29] now tell them the truth I'll never
[47:31] forget the the brother up in in Canada
[47:34] that was there uh and you know he was a
[47:37] semi-pro softball
[47:40] player and uh Russell he's part of your
[47:43] family well anyway David and uh wow this
[47:48] guy was good some of you guys are good
[47:50] but this guy was
[47:54] good well any anyway he gets converted
[47:57] hey he I think he saw a spoken word book
[48:00] on your table got interested in it huh
[48:02] how many of you keep spoken word books
[48:04] around your house how many of you read
[48:07] them don't just have them on the Shelf
[48:09] but read them he he got well what is
[48:11] this he starts reading now elect seed
[48:14] election election has something that has
[48:17] an ability inside whether before you
[48:20] knew it or not there was something
[48:22] inside of there that was to receive and
[48:25] he begins to read there's something
[48:27] about that that quickens his attention
[48:30] wow where did you get this and stuff so
[48:33] Russell made contact with me he said
[48:34] well he he lives up there in Prince
[48:36] Albert not far from you uh why don't you
[48:38] invite him to church we did long story
[48:41] short he gets
[48:42] converted but brother Ron sorry you know
[48:45] sometimes just can't make it because I
[48:47] got to play ball yeah yeah got to play
[48:49] ball man you know that's serious
[48:53] stuff you know when you're in
[48:56] it and that's what you're doing to you
[48:59] that's real
[49:01] important huh so I didn't sit there and
[49:03] say well I'll tell you what son and just
[49:06] go into it and read him the right act no
[49:08] I knew and he said brother Ron I'm out
[49:11] there one one day when I should have
[49:13] been in church and I'm out there in the
[49:15] outfield hey better better hey hey swing
[49:18] all what am I doing out here this is
[49:21] stupid Lord see he he came to it himself
[49:26] so you know what I didn't take it away
[49:28] from
[49:29] him what he did he gave it to God God
[49:32] don't take most of the issues you have
[49:34] away from you you give it to him it's a
[49:38] sacrifice when Jesus Christ bid you to
[49:41] come he bids you to come and die it is a
[49:44] self sacrifice you give it to God Amen
[49:48] too many people said well God I've got
[49:51] this problem and I have this issue and
[49:53] God you take it away from me no you give
[49:56] it to God amen amen amen otherwise it be
[50:00] too easy right oh yeah God I I I have
[50:04] this problem and I have this addiction I
[50:06] have this that I can't give up and
[50:08] everything like that God take it away
[50:09] from me okay spoiled rotten
[50:13] brat that's all you'd be so then God
[50:17] Waits until you get so sick and tired of
[50:20] that thing that is vexing you that you
[50:23] get in desperation when godone guess
[50:24] what then God delivers you brother Bram
[50:27] said isn't it a pity that a lot of times
[50:28] it takes us to get into desperation to
[50:31] call God on the
[50:36] scene
[50:39] amen another uh portion of scripture
[50:43] Hebrews 6 veres
[50:47] 1-3 now I want you to all understand
[50:49] that Paul is trying to get the church
[50:52] and remember Paul comes along a little
[50:55] bit later after there's already been
[50:57] these Apostles and disciples and
[51:00] everything like this and he has a a a
[51:03] Damascus experience and he goes and gets
[51:06] alone with God for three years and when
[51:08] he comes out he finds out that he's
[51:11] preaching the and having the same
[51:14] understanding as the
[51:16] disciples and so Paul being the first
[51:20] church age
[51:22] messenger okay he was the one that God
[51:25] is going to reveal some things and even
[51:27] the disciples said Paul preaches things
[51:30] that's hard to be
[51:33] understood I was caught up into the
[51:36] heavens and whether in the body out of
[51:38] the body I don't know and on and on I
[51:40] mean Paul had so much
[51:43] Revelation that God allowed him to have
[51:46] a thorn in the
[51:48] flesh huh he asked God God take this
[51:51] Thorn and my flesh away he said no my
[51:53] grace is sufficient I want all of you to
[51:56] understand God don't take every Thorn
[51:58] you got
[52:00] away no some of it is
[52:04] there huh to Humble you how many of you
[52:08] just start thinking you're doing so good
[52:09] and you're so great and you your walk is
[52:11] so good and God owes you the kingdom of
[52:13] heaven and you deserve to go into
[52:15] Rapture and all of a sudden you fall
[52:17] flat on your face and go God God give me
[52:21] Grace
[52:22] huh amen
[52:26] Hebrews 6 verse1 amen imagine him
[52:29] teaching this therefore leaving the
[52:33] principle of the doctrine of
[52:37] Christ
[52:38] what leaving the doctrine of Christ are
[52:43] you kidding
[52:45] me therefore
[52:47] leaving did did you guys read
[52:50] that say it therefore
[52:54] therefore
[52:58] Paul I ain't never going to forget that
[53:02] [Music]
[53:05] therefore thanes when you begin to see
[53:09] the word of God and it
[53:11] unfolds it's a continual
[53:14] unfolding brother Ram says the reason we
[53:17] have so many divisions and so many
[53:19] things among us is because of the lack
[53:22] of this understanding that God God's
[53:25] word continually unfolds if we'll put a
[53:27] Comm instead of a period we might even
[53:30] get along with one another by well you
[53:32] don't see it like me well that's okay
[53:35] I'll pray until you do see it like
[53:40] me no stop it you might be ahead of me
[53:45] you might need to be praying for me
[53:47] listen my brother and sister the Bible
[53:50] says when they are comparing themselves
[53:52] among
[53:54] themselves they're not
[53:56] wise so let us get a little bit of
[53:59] wisdom let's not be like my son Matthew
[54:01] when we came home in Germany that time
[54:04] and he was like the second or third from
[54:06] the bottom of the
[54:08] class and his words was hey mom guess
[54:13] what there were two other boys under
[54:17] me I beat two of the kids out of
[54:22] 30 like we're supposed to Rejoice on
[54:24] that
[54:25] but that's kind of how we do don't we
[54:27] look at one another I'm I'm not like him
[54:30] I at least come to church on Sunday
[54:31] morning yeah I know Wednesday night yeah
[54:35] yeah do you see what I'm saying we're
[54:37] measuring ourselves by ourselves measure
[54:40] ourselves to the word of God Amen so
[54:43] he's saying
[54:45] therefore leaving the principles of the
[54:49] doctrine of Christ let us go on onto
[54:54] perfection now that word Perfection and
[54:57] that that's kind of a a word that is
[54:59] Mystical uh among many message Believers
[55:02] because we tend to think that we're
[55:03] going to be actually perfect and walk
[55:06] around and nothing bother
[55:08] us you're in a
[55:10] bubble you're a
[55:13] Nirvana nothing bothers me love love
[55:18] love just everything No
[55:21] Nonsense that's not the Perfection he's
[55:24] talking about maturity
[55:25] yes look let's let's go beyond these
[55:28] things so we can come to the maturity
[55:30] that we can understand the things that
[55:33] God wants us to understand not laying
[55:36] again watch this not laying again the
[55:38] foundation of repentance from dead
[55:42] works and of Faith towards god wow these
[55:46] are major subjects that a lot of times
[55:50] are preached on over and over in the
[55:53] church but we're never say hey let's go
[55:56] beyond this now we how many of you
[55:58] understand repentance towards God Amen I
[56:01] got it how many of you Faith Amen to I
[56:04] got it but let's go on
[56:07] Amen and of the doctrine of baptisms not
[56:11] baptism
[56:13] baptisms now we know that there is a
[56:16] water baptism and a spirit baptism we
[56:18] know the Bible says and many of them in
[56:21] the Old Testament were baptized un Moses
[56:23] Moses baptized no one amen right it says
[56:27] baptized un Moses Under the Red Sea and
[56:29] everything no they came under his
[56:33] anointing his baptism of his anointing
[56:36] they were under but with many of
[56:39] them God was not well pleased seeing
[56:44] that what they heard they did not mix it
[56:46] with
[56:48] faith and many of them fell in the wild
[56:50] I wonder how many that are hearing this
[56:54] message of the hour and not mixing it
[56:56] with faith but you're getting
[57:00] understanding you're getting knowledge
[57:02] the Bible says there'll be some that
[57:03] forever will learn but never coming to
[57:06] the knowledge of
[57:11] Truth the doctrine of baptisms baptism
[57:14] of water and a baptism of
[57:18] fire John said I indeed baptize you unto
[57:22] water unto repentance but the one coming
[57:25] after me his baptism is far
[57:28] greater so he's putting an emphasis on
[57:31] the one coming after me I just preach to
[57:34] you the kingdom of God and tell you to
[57:36] repent but there's one coming after me
[57:40] whose baptism is far greater because he
[57:43] will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
[57:46] Fire so the doctrine of
[57:49] baptisms and of the laying on of hands
[57:52] isn't it amazing how a lot of times
[57:54] people people will divide over little
[57:57] issues do we lay hands on people or do
[58:00] we not would yes of course but let's go
[58:03] beyond see he's trying to get them to a
[58:06] higher understanding amen and I'm going
[58:08] to show you some quotes later I'm not
[58:10] going to do it tonight but brother
[58:12] Brenham says Hey for every one person
[58:14] that comes to the platform in a prayer
[58:17] line he said there's 50 out there that
[58:19] get to healed that's right he said it's
[58:21] a 50 to1
[58:23] ratio that's
[58:25] amazing you don't need a prayer card you
[58:28] don't need to come up here you don't
[58:29] need us to lay hands on you you just
[58:32] have to have
[58:34] faith so he says so God gives him the
[58:38] gift of of healing and discernment to
[58:41] get the people's attention I don't know
[58:43] you sir I don't know where you're from
[58:45] come here that's okay that that you're
[58:47] just feeling at Presence come here all
[58:49] of a sudden he drops into this realm and
[58:52] he begins to discern are those things
[58:55] true yes yes wait just a second I see
[59:00] you and you're this and that are those
[59:02] things true now I don't even remember
[59:04] what I said he said I'd have to go back
[59:07] and listen to the tape now what he's
[59:08] doing here's a prophet I want you to
[59:11] understand he can go back into
[59:14] time or forward into
[59:17] time because his gift allows him to
[59:21] enter into that Eternal realm so now
[59:25] he's using this gift and the people that
[59:29] are sitting out there that maybe are in
[59:32] question themselves and and brother
[59:35] Brandon will say and he's the same
[59:37] yesterday today and forever are those
[59:40] things true sir why how many of you
[59:43] believe how many of you yes sir why you
[59:46] out there in the blue shirt yes God is
[59:48] just touch you you out here and you and
[59:51] next thing you know what they were doing
[59:53] they saw the The Works of God they were
[59:56] moved in their faith they came into the
[59:59] realm and all of a sudden man people are
[1:00:01] getting healed everywhere he sent his
[1:00:04] word and it healed the
[1:00:09] people I will get into that later and
[1:00:12] explain that just a little bit further
[1:00:15] so the doctrine of baptism laying on of
[1:00:18] hands and of the Resurrection then and
[1:00:20] of Eternal judgment this we will do if
[1:00:25] God
[1:00:26] permits well God help and permit us to
[1:00:31] go
[1:00:32] beyond certain doctrinal things that we
[1:00:35] tend to want to fight
[1:00:37] over you
[1:00:40] know God help us have a right attitude
[1:00:43] amen have a teachable spirit one thing I
[1:00:47] can't stand it's a know it all yeah yeah
[1:00:50] yeah yeah yeah yeah well what about the
[1:00:52] yeah yeah yeah yeah well what about this
[1:00:54] over yeah yeah yeah yeah we hired a guy
[1:00:56] at ralson panus said he he put on his
[1:00:58] resume he's got like five years on a
[1:01:02] forklift five years hey once you've
[1:01:04] driven one forklift they're all pretty
[1:01:07] much the same up down sideways lift all
[1:01:11] that right so this guy comes I say okay
[1:01:14] we'll go out there and move some pallets
[1:01:16] gets on this
[1:01:22] thing like this hey he didn't have the
[1:01:25] slightest idea I said okay come over
[1:01:28] here let me let me show you yeah yeah
[1:01:30] yeah yeah yeah I know I
[1:01:32] know okay I watch him he can't get it I
[1:01:36] said hey come here let me just give you
[1:01:38] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I
[1:01:41] know so after about the third or fourth
[1:01:43] time I said yeah yeah yeah yeah you're
[1:01:44] going to get fired if you keep telling
[1:01:46] me you know it all amen I said you're a
[1:01:49] liar you ain't got a half hour on a
[1:01:52] forklift now if you want to keep your
[1:01:54] job you want to be taught yeah yeah yeah
[1:01:59] yeah proof was in he didn't know how to
[1:02:02] drive
[1:02:03] one he just I needed the job I said okay
[1:02:08] you can you know if you will
[1:02:11] learn God help us to quit being no it
[1:02:14] alls within the
[1:02:16] message and to
[1:02:21] learn amen right attitude all right I
[1:02:24] want to title
[1:02:27] this the revelation of the son of man
[1:02:29] part
[1:02:30] three and I don't know how many parts
[1:02:33] I'm going to have maybe till the
[1:02:35] Rapture because this the the revealing
[1:02:38] of the son of man is of the utmost
[1:02:42] importance to each one of us amen it's
[1:02:45] not learning this message it's not uh
[1:02:49] learning Church order it's not those
[1:02:51] things they're important knowing how to
[1:02:53] dress and pay your ties and all of those
[1:02:56] things those things are important yes
[1:02:58] they're a part of the message but let's
[1:03:01] go on
[1:03:03] unto
[1:03:05] Perfection and we will do that the Lord
[1:03:09] willing if he permits now sometimes I'm
[1:03:12] a little factious no I'm not going to
[1:03:14] stay on a certain subject forever
[1:03:17] because I tend to think that we get into
[1:03:19] a rut but the revelation of the son of
[1:03:22] man may I tell each one of
[1:03:26] you that it was not until I had a
[1:03:29] Damascus experience with God yes the
[1:03:33] Lord had had had dealt with me I come
[1:03:36] into the message got baptized I got the
[1:03:39] Holy Ghost and everything but we got
[1:03:42] into a rut of just going to
[1:03:45] church and it wasn't until I got sent
[1:03:47] over to Europe and I was put alone in an
[1:03:51] office and I had for the first time in
[1:03:53] my life
[1:03:55] chronologically all the tapes from 47 to
[1:03:59] 65 I never had that before back
[1:04:03] then
[1:04:05] um there was some you could order some
[1:04:07] tapes and get them in the little packets
[1:04:11] like five sermons at a time soon as you
[1:04:13] paid for that you got your next one any
[1:04:16] of you remember any of you old enough to
[1:04:17] remember that yeah it was it was nice
[1:04:21] and and so that's how we did because we
[1:04:23] couldn't afford listen
[1:04:25] most of the time we were just paycheck
[1:04:27] to paycheck so we couldn't afford to to
[1:04:31] get a complete set of tapes so now for
[1:04:34] the first time
[1:04:36] iow where do I start I started megga
[1:04:39] doing Here's the the real truth of the
[1:04:41] matter while I'm pack packaging books
[1:04:44] and I am sending packages of tapes and
[1:04:47] books around the world I'm listening to
[1:04:49] tapes my I tell you wow I'm having such
[1:04:53] a epiphanies from God I stopped oh
[1:05:01] wow praise
[1:05:03] God I mean sometimes it gets so
[1:05:08] outstanding that that I'm sorry it's the
[1:05:12] old lingo it's
[1:05:15] mindblowing I just go wow and then I
[1:05:19] realize that the more I
[1:05:22] know and the more God gives me
[1:05:24] Revelation the less Revelation I have
[1:05:27] cuz you know what God's too vast that's
[1:05:30] right how can I attain it that's why job
[1:05:33] said oh that I might get all the
[1:05:35] learning that I come to Perfection no
[1:05:38] it's not it no God is so great he's so
[1:05:41] vast but the patterns and the examples
[1:05:45] throughout the Bible are all there now
[1:05:47] I'm talking on the revealing of the son
[1:05:49] of man and I want to go into this
[1:05:51] subject just for a little while tonight
[1:05:53] of we're seeing the greater things we're
[1:05:56] seeing the greater because Jesus said oh
[1:05:58] because I I told you behold an Israel
[1:06:01] Israelite and whom there is no gu does
[1:06:04] that make you a message
[1:06:05] believer well I want to ask you where
[1:06:07] are all the people under the first and
[1:06:09] second pull because that was an
[1:06:12] attracting pull third pull is not third
[1:06:15] pull is offensive does this offend you
[1:06:19] yeah I tell you what tell me to eat your
[1:06:22] flesh and drink your blood you got to be
[1:06:24] a cannibal and the Bible says and many
[1:06:27] of his
[1:06:28] disciples walked no more with him they
[1:06:31] said this is a hard saying so remember
[1:06:34] now that the third pole the revealing of
[1:06:36] the word is
[1:06:38] separating just like Paul said this
[1:06:41] morning when you see God revealed this
[1:06:43] that then he separates and it comes up
[1:06:45] here this that God reveals in the days
[1:06:47] of Luther comes God reveals everything
[1:06:49] they organize God
[1:06:51] separates we see that all down through
[1:06:53] the scripture
[1:06:54] so God could not bless Abraham until he
[1:06:57] separated from
[1:06:59] lot sometimes it's going to take you to
[1:07:03] separate from some of those that are
[1:07:05] holding you
[1:07:06] back amen if you're going to get better
[1:07:10] at tennis play somebody that's better
[1:07:12] than you that's right huh if you want to
[1:07:15] be a better singer or a better piano
[1:07:18] player find somebody
[1:07:20] that knows more than
[1:07:22] chopsticks
[1:07:28] find somebody that challenges
[1:07:31] you amen amen that's why my brother my
[1:07:35] sister we come to
[1:07:37] church to BR to be brought into
[1:07:40] remembrance but also to cause you to
[1:07:42] come up
[1:07:43] higher every teacher that I ever had in
[1:07:46] school that was a good teacher and that
[1:07:48] I enjoyed was
[1:07:51] thought-provoking was one that actually
[1:07:53] made you want to learn that instill I do
[1:07:57] not like a teacher okay open the the uh
[1:08:00] textbook let's go to page 35 and it's
[1:08:03] just as dry as anything and who you
[1:08:07] couldn't wait to get out of the
[1:08:09] class but those that were teachers that
[1:08:12] inspired listen
[1:08:14] everybody liked the teacher that
[1:08:17] inspired and you know what you had to
[1:08:19] you had to really press it to try to get
[1:08:23] in that class
[1:08:24] class
[1:08:25] oh I had a few teachers that let me tell
[1:08:29] you were
[1:08:31] outstanding rest of them I I don't even
[1:08:33] know remember what grade I'll be lucky
[1:08:36] to know was it a male or
[1:08:38] female but I've had
[1:08:40] some that were outstanding so it is even
[1:08:44] in the message there will be different
[1:08:47] ones that you will go and you will hear
[1:08:49] and there will be abundance of words and
[1:08:51] they'll use quotes and they'll think
[1:08:53] that the reading of the quote and the
[1:08:55] louder the voice and here's what he said
[1:08:58] is
[1:09:00] anointing now brother Paul
[1:09:03] loveall he found a quote the other day
[1:09:05] talk about that Supreme
[1:09:09] anointing I've shared this quote with
[1:09:11] you but he said really the Supreme
[1:09:13] anointing he says you would think it
[1:09:15] would be all kinds of emotion and
[1:09:17] screaming and hollering he said no he
[1:09:20] said when God comes down he said Jesus
[1:09:22] Took the scroll read where it was at
[1:09:24] here he was under Supreme anointing
[1:09:26] close the book and sat
[1:09:28] down
[1:09:31] wow he says it's Supreme
[1:09:34] anointing under
[1:09:38] control he said you know some people
[1:09:40] like to toot the
[1:09:43] whistle but he says he said a real train
[1:09:47] puts the steam to the
[1:09:51] track not
[1:09:54] yeah H
[1:09:55] predestiny yeah elected and you ain't
[1:09:58] going
[1:09:59] nowhere he is tooting your horn brother
[1:10:03] Ram said even the other example you know
[1:10:05] we talk about well it's noise and I
[1:10:08] Let's Make A Noise unto the Lord and
[1:10:10] really there was all kinds of noise and
[1:10:11] stuff yes I understand that but brother
[1:10:13] brandham said now you watch he said when
[1:10:15] that wagon comes down the street and
[1:10:18] it's empty and it goes over that
[1:10:22] cobblestone he said making all kinds of
[1:10:25] noise he said but put a big old load of
[1:10:27] hay on it or some wood he said comes
[1:10:29] down the same
[1:10:34] street so a lot of times all of this
[1:10:37] stuff listen I do like to get excited I
[1:10:40] like that little bit of noise I don't
[1:10:41] want people to be dead I don't want you
[1:10:43] to just sit there huh but I want you to
[1:10:47] interact I want you to say Amen break
[1:10:50] the sound barrier once in a while you'll
[1:10:52] help the minister
[1:10:57] you'll pull the sermon out of
[1:10:59] me so Paul's trying to get them get this
[1:11:03] understanding Paul's trying to get them
[1:11:05] to come to a higher
[1:11:07] level of
[1:11:09] understanding let's go
[1:11:11] beyond these
[1:11:14] things
[1:11:15] wow so God reveals himself in Tim
[1:11:19] relased Revelation I preached that years
[1:11:22] ago not only here at at my own church

[1:11:37] there and will you have come up and go
[1:11:39] to the meeting well brother Ted is not
[1:11:41] real good at responding to emails and
[1:11:43] different things and finally about a
[1:11:45] month before I said Ted you haven't told
[1:11:48] me anything about it now either you get
[1:11:51] back to me or forget it I'm not going so

[1:13:34] Revelation destroy this temple in three
[1:13:37] days he didn't explain
[1:13:39] it in fact it wasn't until after the
[1:13:43] resurrection oh oh it wasn't that Temple
[1:13:48] was the Temple of his body Eat My Flesh
[1:13:52] and drink my blood
[1:13:54] oh it wasn't until later wow but you
[1:13:59] know what a lot of the people got
[1:14:00] offended and they walked no more with
[1:14:02] him third pole is
[1:14:04] offensive third pole doesn't explain it
[1:14:07] third pole causes you to get into it and
[1:14:10] say Lord I don't understand what he just
[1:14:12] said but I believe
[1:14:14] it huh there are things that are going
[1:14:17] to be preached to you that you won't
[1:14:19] catch it at that time but you know what
[1:14:23] it's
[1:14:23] put on your hard drive it's in your
[1:14:26] memory and the Holy Spirit at some time
[1:14:29] will bring to your remance oh yeah I
[1:14:33] remember what he
[1:14:35] preached and sermons that you don't
[1:14:38] remember had no
[1:14:40] effect sermons that you don't remember
[1:14:43] the
[1:14:44] title who preached it when but sermons
[1:14:47] that had an effect on you that caused
[1:14:51] you to to get right with God or
[1:14:53] something like that you remember who
[1:14:54] preached it whether it was Sunday
[1:14:56] morning Sunday evening you remember the
[1:14:58] scripture it's amazing I can go back to
[1:15:01] Europe and I can go to somewhere that I
[1:15:04] haven't preached in 15 years and there's
[1:15:06] four or five people that say wow brother
[1:15:09] Ron we haven't seen you in 15 years I
[1:15:11] remember when you preached here the
[1:15:14] threshing
[1:15:15] floor did I preach on the thring floor
[1:15:18] yeah you did man it was so good and
[1:15:20] David danced before the ark but when
[1:15:23] they came to the threshing floor of
[1:15:25] ornan and The Oxen stumbled and and usua
[1:15:28] grabbed the ark and the anger of God
[1:15:32] slow and David quit
[1:15:35] Dancing see it looked like everything
[1:15:37] was in order but it was on the wrong
[1:15:40] oxcart amen it was on an oxcart and not
[1:15:43] over the hearts of the
[1:15:45] Levites brother Bram What's the title of
[1:15:47] the sermon trying to do God a service
[1:15:50] see a lot of times saints of God it's
[1:15:52] not the emotional thing but it's the
[1:15:55] word of God revealed to you and I love
[1:15:58] it when sermons when ministers preach a
[1:16:00] sermon now brother Paul you were you
[1:16:02] were Dynamic this morning in a sense you
[1:16:05] didn't have to raise your voice you
[1:16:07] didn't have to be demonstrative you
[1:16:09] didn't have to beat on his you didn't
[1:16:10] have to no just teach because it was
[1:16:13] coming out and you know what if you
[1:16:15] throw it near me I'm going to catch it
[1:16:18] huh if you're a good ball player hey man
[1:16:20] just hit it out in left field I got it
[1:16:22] man
[1:16:23] am
[1:16:26] like so it's not necessarily how
[1:16:30] loud there's nothing wrong with being
[1:16:32] loud there are ministers that can't
[1:16:34] preach without being loud that's okay
[1:16:38] that's that's
[1:16:39] them I'm not I'm not going to slide
[1:16:43] them I told one brother I would not like
[1:16:46] to
[1:16:46] be in your church because every time you
[1:16:52] got to be loud
[1:16:53] and you got to this and you got to
[1:16:59] sweat I I I said if I had to go and hit
[1:17:02] a home Runner Grand Slam every time I
[1:17:04] come to the
[1:17:05] pulpit because there are times when it's
[1:17:07] going to be more perspiration than
[1:17:12] inspiration huh come on you know what
[1:17:14] we're talking about you your own lives
[1:17:16] huh you come to church sometime you've
[1:17:17] been in a battle guess what song leader
[1:17:20] gets up there let's all stand well how
[1:17:22] many of you uh are happy to be in the
[1:17:24] house of the Lord it's a good thing we
[1:17:25] can't read your
[1:17:29] thoughts you really want to know the
[1:17:34] truth sometimes I catch
[1:17:39] it and you know what I want to I want to
[1:17:42] say this to all of you as a pastor I'd
[1:17:44] love to see all of you enter in sure I
[1:17:46] do quite honestly I love to see all of
[1:17:49] you enter in and when we have a song
[1:17:51] service I I want to say this to those of
[1:17:53] you who do enter in I love
[1:17:55] it I love it I love to see somebody
[1:17:58] enjoy what they're singing and even if
[1:18:01] you're going through a hard time to
[1:18:02] praise God
[1:18:04] anyway it's not because you're having a
[1:18:07] good time and you got money in the bank
[1:18:10] and your wife loves you and your kid
[1:18:11] loves you and your dog loves you and
[1:18:13] everything is going good no there are
[1:18:16] times when you're going to be in stocks
[1:18:18] and bonds you got you you you're in a
[1:18:20] trouble things are going upside down why
[1:18:23] don't you just curse God and
[1:18:29] die there are times when you just don't
[1:18:33] you come to church and guess what you've
[1:18:35] been beat
[1:18:36] up you've been
[1:18:41] threshed and you you ain't all that
[1:18:44] happy you're just there because you know
[1:18:48] you should be
[1:18:49] there but at some time yeah
[1:18:54] at some time because I believe that God
[1:18:56] works in mysterious ways how many of you
[1:19:00] know that more demons are cast out by
[1:19:03] the ministering of the word than by
[1:19:05] laying on of
[1:19:08] hands so we could have somebody up here
[1:19:10] come up here and God miraculously
[1:19:13] delivered them but guess guess what 50
[1:19:16] to
[1:19:17] one there'll be more people out there oh
[1:19:20] praise God I got it there are times when
[1:19:23] God gives you a revelation and and
[1:19:25] here's a mysterious thing when the woman
[1:19:29] who had an issue of blood and she had
[1:19:30] gone to many Physicians and he spent all
[1:19:32] of her money trying to get well and she
[1:19:36] had heard about
[1:19:37] Jesus and there wasn't a prayer line
[1:19:40] there wasn't anything it was just a
[1:19:42] throng of people wanting to see Jesus
[1:19:46] and they were all pressing in on him and
[1:19:48] all of a sudden Jesus said who touched
[1:19:50] my
[1:19:51] clothing
[1:19:53] who touched
[1:19:55] me now I want you to understand this
[1:19:57] because we don't play this side of the
[1:19:59] record all of the Holy Ghost fi
[1:20:01] disciples missed the move of God
[1:20:05] Amen true sometimes we can be so busy
[1:20:09] with church and with singing with things
[1:20:11] going on that there can be a service
[1:20:13] going right there and somebody reaches
[1:20:15] out and touches him during the word
[1:20:18] being preached and hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:21] and they get delivered
[1:20:23] and nobody knew
[1:20:25] it and here she had a issue of blood she
[1:20:29] touched the Hem of His Garment and Jesus
[1:20:32] stopped and he said who touched
[1:20:34] me and Peter that
[1:20:37] spokesman puts his foot in his mouth
[1:20:39] more
[1:20:40] than what do you mean who touched you
[1:20:43] can't you see everybody's touching you
[1:20:45] he said but
[1:20:47] virtue he said ver he said somebody
[1:20:49] touch me
[1:20:50] different so sometimes they can be in a
[1:20:53] service that's going on and Jesus is
[1:20:56] there he's walking among
[1:20:59] you but it depends on how you touch
[1:21:03] him and there can be just it seemed like
[1:21:06] a not a great move of God and there's
[1:21:08] there's just things happening and and
[1:21:11] all of a sudden
[1:21:15] somebody while the preacher was
[1:21:19] preaching Somebody Touched Me Hallelujah

[1:27:14] within us we need sermons like what
[1:27:17] brother Paul was talking about this
[1:27:18] morning hey let me tell you that was
[1:27:20] good for every one of us sit there look
[1:27:23] at ourselves and when we admit and we
[1:27:25] point the finger back at ourselves and
[1:27:27] say I was
[1:27:29] wrong it takes a big man to
[1:27:33] admit you were
[1:27:36] wrong I'm just glad I've never been
[1:27:39] wrong
[1:27:41] yet I have to keep you laughing once in
[1:27:44] a while just you know you you guys know
[1:27:47] that I I don't really mean
[1:27:51] that
[1:27:58] do you know you would not have
[1:27:59] fellowship with yourself 15 years ago
[1:28:03] that's right cuz you just didn't have it
[1:28:06] you weren't catching
[1:28:08] it you were still on the sincere milk of
[1:28:12] the
[1:28:13] word and you weren't catching the deeper
[1:28:16] things and somebody else wants to
[1:28:17] fellowship with you and you're still on
[1:28:19] Gaga
[1:28:20] stuff you're on baby
[1:28:23] padum no no that's why the Apostle Paul
[1:28:27] says hey look
[1:28:30] sincere he says that fresh meat belongs
[1:28:33] to those who are of full age huh got got
[1:28:37] some chers here that's why God gave them
[1:28:40] to you that's why babies are not born
[1:28:43] with teeth most of them I know there are
[1:28:45] a few kids that have had a tooth or two
[1:28:49] but it would be awfully uncomfortable on
[1:28:57] Mama okay so but there Comes A Time
[1:29:01] comes a time when teeth start coming and
[1:29:06] they get a little
[1:29:08] agitated you got to put stuff on their
[1:29:10] gums and and everything children
[1:29:13] everything because you know what
[1:29:15] everything is SE taste smell feel so
[1:29:18] they see their feet for the first
[1:29:20] time
[1:29:23] their
[1:29:25] hands everything is TA everything and
[1:29:28] taste is one of those areas that they
[1:29:30] put everything in their
[1:29:31] mouth they find something on the floor
[1:29:33] no no they go out on the
[1:29:40] lawn they see something they can see a
[1:29:43] snail okay you know what I'm talking
[1:29:47] about he says strong meat belongs to
[1:29:50] those who are of of full age this is
[1:29:54] where I believe that saints of God we've
[1:29:57] got to have the spiritual
[1:30:00] maturity Jesus said I have so many
[1:30:03] things I want to teach
[1:30:05] you seeing you cannot bear them now I'm
[1:30:08] glad that he just didn't stop there and

[1:31:58] eye so I told the man I said you know
[1:32:02] hey are you 60 I was just making a

[1:32:31] Ancient of
[1:32:34] Days yeah you young boys
[1:32:38] Marcus I'm an old
[1:32:41] man going to be 71

[1:33:50] leaning forward
[1:33:53] and I do a Superman slide
[1:33:56] halfway and I pile
[1:34:00] up I was never so
[1:34:03] embarrassed I told John dubsky who Tri
[1:34:11] me I said run my body said
[1:34:19] no when I was a child
[1:34:22] I spake as a
[1:34:24] child so the revealing of the son of man
[1:34:28] is a
[1:34:29] process you don't get it
[1:34:32] overnight you don't pass go and collect
[1:34:35] $200 this is Monopoly no no no this you
[1:34:41] are going to go and you're going to go
[1:34:44] from stages of a little bitty babe in

[1:34:50] to fall you're going to make mistakes
[1:34:52] you're going to go from grade one to
[1:34:54] grade two to grade three you're going to
[1:34:56] go through those things and yes you're
[1:34:59] going to
[1:35:00] mature
[1:35:02] hopefully CU there are
[1:35:04] [Music]
[1:35:06] some that never did
[1:35:09] mature they just grew
[1:35:11] bigger and didn't
[1:35:13] mature and that's sad when you see
[1:35:17] that God help us to have the maturity in
[1:35:21] Christ
[1:35:22] and the revealing of the son of man it
[1:35:24] continues it goes on it does not stop it
[1:35:28] continues it keeps going God bless you

[1:40:16] inventory have you made mistakes yeah we
[1:40:18] all
[1:40:19] have we're not doing practice
[1:40:22] sin
[1:40:24] no but what we're
[1:40:26] doing we're kept confessing our faults
[1:40:29] to God coming here and so let a man eat
[1:40:33] of that bread and drink of that cup
[1:40:35] because he that eateth and drinketh
[1:40:40] unworthily that's why what we do tonight
[1:40:43] you take a moment you say oh Father
[1:40:46] maybe I haven't been living just the way
[1:40:48] I should maybe I've done some things
[1:40:51] that I'm not really proud of maybe the
[1:40:53] flesh has gotten in the way but father I
[1:40:56] want you to cleanse me put it under the
[1:40:59] blood right now father and we confess
[1:41:01] all of our faults and we say oh God come
[1:41:04] and cleanse us and then you have a right
[1:41:07] to come and take of that bread and drink
[1:41:11] of that cup 1
[1:41:13] Corinthians chapter
[1:41:16] 11 and verse
[1:41:19] 23 for I have received of the Lord that
[1:41:23] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:41:26] Lord Jesus in the same night in which he
[1:41:28] was betrayed took
[1:41:30] bread they call this the last
[1:41:34] supper it's the last time he's going to
[1:41:36] have us he said this is the last time
[1:41:39] I'll not eat and drink again until we
[1:41:44] come to the wedding
[1:41:46] supper here he is the same night which
[1:41:50] he was betrayed took bread and when he
[1:41:51] had given thanks he break it said take
[1:41:55] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:41:57] you this doe in remembrance of me he's
[1:42:00] breaking the
[1:42:02] word because he is the bread which came
[1:42:05] down from heaven after the same manner
[1:42:08] he also he took the cup and when he had
[1:42:11] slept saying this cup is the New
[1:42:13] Testament in my blood this do ye as
[1:42:17] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:42:19] me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:42:22] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:42:24] Lord's death till he
[1:42:26] come excuse
[1:42:28] me wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:42:31] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:42:33] unworthy shall be guilty of the body and
[1:42:36] blood of the Lord but let a man examine
[1:42:39] himself so let him eat of that bread and
[1:42:42] drink of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:42:44] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:42:47] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[1:42:50] Lord's body for this
[1:42:53] cause for this
[1:42:56] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:43:01] and many sleep what cause not Discerning
[1:43:04] Lord's
[1:43:06] body for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:43:11] should not be
[1:43:13] judged but when we are judged we are
[1:43:16] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:43:18] be condemned with the world where my
[1:43:21] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:43:24] Terry one for another and if any man
[1:43:26] hunger let him eat at home that you come
[1:43:29] not together unto condemnation the rest
[1:43:32] will I set in order when I
[1:43:35] come all
[1:43:39] right you said I I have some gloves here

[1:59:28] 13 verses 1-1
[1:59:48] 17
[1:59:54] excuse
[1:59:58] me now before the Feast of the
[2:00:02] Passover when Jesus knew that his hour
[2:00:04] was come that he should depart out of
[2:00:06] this world under the
[2:00:08] father having loved his own which were
[2:00:11] in the
[2:00:13] world he loved them unto the end that's
[2:00:16] one of my most favorite scriptures amen
[2:00:19] he loved them unto the
[2:00:23] end and supper being ended and the devil
[2:00:26] having now put into the heart of judas's
[2:00:28] scariot Simon's son to betray him it
[2:00:31] went from his head to his heart and now
[2:00:35] he betrays
[2:00:37] him you understand that now the devil
[2:00:40] having put into the heart he thought
[2:00:43] about it but now it puts it into his
[2:00:46] heart to betray the Lord Jesus no
[2:00:49] knowing Jesus knowing that the father
[2:00:51] had given all things into his hands and
[2:00:53] that he was come from God and went to
[2:00:57] God he rises from supper and laid aside
[2:01:00] his
[2:01:00] garments and took a towel and GED
[2:01:04] himself after that he porth water into a
[2:01:08] basin and began to wash the disciples
[2:01:11] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[2:01:13] wherewith he was
[2:01:16] girded then cometh he to Simon Peter
[2:01:21] and Peter saith unto him Lord does thou
[2:01:24] wash my
[2:01:26] feet and Jesus answered and said to
[2:01:29] him what I do thou knowest not
[2:01:35] now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Time
[2:01:40] released Revelation you don't know it
[2:01:42] now later you'll Peter you'll catch it
[2:01:45] one
[2:01:46] day Peter saith in him Thou shalt shall
[2:01:49] never wash my feet and Jesus answered
[2:01:52] him if I wash thee not thou has no part
[2:01:55] with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord
[2:02:00] not my feet
[2:02:01] only also my
[2:02:03] hands and my
[2:02:06] head and Jesus say to him he that is
[2:02:10] washed needeth not saved to wash his
[2:02:14] feet but is clean ever with and you are
[2:02:17] clean but not
[2:02:20] all for he knew who should betray him
[2:02:24] therefore said he ye are not all clean
[2:02:27] so after he had washed their feet and
[2:02:29] had given his taken his garments and was
[2:02:33] set down again he said unto
[2:02:35] them know ye what I have done to
[2:02:38] you you call me master and
[2:02:42] Lord and you say well for so I
[2:02:46] am if I then your Lord and Master have
[2:02:50] washed your feet you also ought to wash
[2:02:53] one another's feet is this a commandment
[2:02:55] of God this is not a suggestion that's
[2:02:59] why everybody should be here everybody
[2:03:01] that claims this to be their Church
[2:03:03] unless they got for some reason they
[2:03:05] have to to work or

[2:03:13] feet I've done this I've given you
