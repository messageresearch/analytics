[37:49] [Music]
[37:53] [Applause]
[38:02] is that still
[38:20] on let's just give him a praise offering
[38:22] this morning
[38:24] Hallelujah he inhabits the Praises of
[38:26] his people
[38:28] amen I was sitting in the service before
[38:31] we started this morning and thinking of
[38:33] that song through it all I've learn to
[38:35] trust in Jesus learn to trust in God the
[38:39] verse to that is if I never had a
[38:42] problem I'd never know that he could
[38:45] solve him and I thank him now for the
[38:46] mountains I thank him for The Valleys I
[38:49] thank him for the storms that he's
[38:50] brought us through and I opened up the
[38:53] Psalms and David was one of the best
[38:58] examples we have of worshiping and
[39:01] regardless of whether he was on the
[39:03] mountain or he was hiding in a cave or
[39:06] he was not even didn't have a home
[39:07] didn't have his family around him but he
[39:10] encouraged himself in the Lord in those
[39:12] times and he said let all those that
[39:14] seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee
[39:17] let such as love thy salvation say
[39:20] continually the Lord be magnified so
[39:22] it's not just when we feel like it it's
[39:25] not just when we're up on the
[39:26] Mountaintop it's not just when we're
[39:28] down in the valley but continually We
[39:31] Want To Praise Him and so that's the
[39:33] song I want to sing for you this
[39:35] morning Satan's a liar he wants to make
[39:38] us think that we're poppers he knows
[39:40] himself we're Children of the king so
[39:43] let's just praise the Lord together this
[39:44] morning he can work through those who
[39:46] Praise
[39:47] Him
[39:54] Hallelujah when you're up again a
[39:58] struggle that shatters all your
[40:01] dreams your hopes have been cruy crushed
[40:05] by Satan's manifested
[40:09] schemes and you feel the urge within you
[40:14] to submit to Earthly
[40:16] fears well don't let the faith you're
[40:20] standing in seem to disappear but praise
[40:25] the Lord
[40:27] L he can work through those who praise
[40:31] him praise the
[40:34] Lord for our God and habits praise
[40:39] praise the
[40:41] Lord for the chains that seem to bind
[40:45] you serve only to remind you that
[40:50] they'll drop powerless behind you when
[40:54] you
[40:55] praise him
[41:01] now Satan is just a liar and he wants to
[41:06] make us think that we're just poppers
[41:10] when he knows himself we're Children of
[41:13] the king so lift up the mighty Shield of
[41:18] faith for the battle must be won we know
[41:22] that Jesus Christ is risen and the works
[41:27] of already done so praise the
[41:31] Lord he can work through those who
[41:34] praise him praise the
[41:38] Lord for our God in habits praise praise
[41:43] the
[41:45] Lord for the chains that seem to bind
[41:49] you serve only to remind you that
[41:52] they'll drop powerless behind you when
[41:56] you pray
[41:57] praise him when you
[42:01] praise him when you
[42:07] praise
[42:09] him when you

[1:08:04] paid at Calvary and the redeeming blood
[1:08:07] of Jesus Christ Our Savior we can come
[1:08:11] boldly Before the Throne this
[1:08:13] morning and we would ask you to meet

[1:08:25] within the body of Christ not only here
[1:08:28] but
[1:08:29] globally and so father I would ask that
[1:08:31] you once again by the foolishness of

[1:08:50] remain standing thank you
[1:08:52] musicians amen
[1:09:01] we want to remember
[1:09:07] Israel they have declared
[1:09:12] war there is a war of persecution upon
[1:09:15] the
[1:09:18] Jews understand that the prophet of God
[1:09:21] said that this
[1:09:23] war this hatred
[1:09:26] this vehement that they have towards the
[1:09:28] Jews he said Stalin Hitler and musolini
[1:09:33] in a
[1:09:34] pre-tribulation spirit began to
[1:09:37] persecute the Jews in the second world
[1:09:39] war and millions of them were gassed
[1:09:42] starved shot murdered in every way that
[1:09:46] they could possibly do it and brother
[1:09:49] Brenham said there is is a
[1:09:52] preview of a hatred that is coming
[1:09:55] because we are ready to change
[1:09:58] Administration and we are going to the
[1:10:01] bride is going to go up the two
[1:10:04] witnesses come down three and A2 years
[1:10:07] of
[1:10:08] tribulation and this vment that you see
[1:10:11] against the
[1:10:12] Jews will come against the
[1:10:15] 144,000 and they will be martyred how
[1:10:19] many of you know that amen and he says
[1:10:21] and the foolish virgin that is left that
[1:10:25] did not have the oil guess what they
[1:10:28] will be martyred
[1:10:31] also oh God May there not be one of
[1:10:36] us that would miss that
[1:10:38] Rapture it behooves us to know that all
[1:10:42] of these signs around us are flashing
[1:10:46] red lights of his soon
[1:10:50] coming oh God I
[1:10:52] pray that you will bless each and every
[1:10:56] one of us this morning and we pray for
[1:10:59] the
[1:11:00] word I was really torn this morning I
[1:11:04] had maybe five different directions I
[1:11:06] could go and I finally just relaxed and
[1:11:10] I said okay Lord have thy way with us
[1:11:14] this
[1:11:15] morning and just speak to our hearts we
[1:11:19] ask God to bless his word this morning
[1:11:22] turn with me too uh and I I've got four
[1:11:27] scriptures here but Brethren that are in
[1:11:29] the back I want to just come up to
[1:11:32] Luke 17:
[1:11:36] 29-30 and then I'll read the others
[1:11:40] after I have everyone to be
[1:11:43] seated Luke
[1:11:45] 17:
[1:11:48] 29-30 you all know in the days of Noah
[1:11:52] in the days of
[1:11:54] lot so shall it
[1:11:56] be and the Bible
[1:11:59] reads but
[1:12:01] it shall not be so excuse me I'm sorry
[1:12:05] but in the
[1:12:06] days I'm sorry my my vision is a little
[1:12:12] blurry you forgive me I had eye
[1:12:17] surgery so it blurs together here Luke
[1:12:21] 17: 29 but the same day that lot went
[1:12:24] out of of Sodom it rained fire and
[1:12:28] brimstone from Heaven destroyed them all
[1:12:32] even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:12:36] the son of
[1:12:37] man is revealed may God bless the
[1:12:39] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:12:42] thank you to all of those that had those
[1:12:45] song
[1:12:47] specials brother John that was wonderful
[1:12:50] I love
[1:12:51] it I believe songs that are sung by
[1:12:55] Saints sing it by
[1:12:58] inspiration and hope wow what a
[1:13:02] voice don't hide
[1:13:05] it use
[1:13:07] it to all of you this
[1:13:12] morning I just want to say I want to be
[1:13:15] led of the holy
[1:13:19] spirit
[1:13:22] because I share with you from my my
[1:13:26] heart that the reason that I stand
[1:13:29] before
[1:13:30] you is because of what God has done in
[1:13:33] my life amen how that at 18 years of age
[1:13:38] in the beaches of
[1:13:41] California I came
[1:13:43] across a wonderful
[1:13:46] message people introduced to
[1:13:49] me a
[1:13:51] message that I did not know would change
[1:13:54] the course of my
[1:14:01] life and I want to title my sermon this
[1:14:04] morning and then I'm going to go back to
[1:14:06] my other
[1:14:10] scriptures but I want to title this the
[1:14:12] revealing of the son of
[1:14:15] man I want to take a subject of the
[1:14:18] change of
[1:14:19] ministry and the change of
[1:14:23] administration when you stand from
[1:14:26] scriptures and you see by types and
[1:14:29] shadows then you know and can predict
[1:14:32] the direction of where we're
[1:14:34] going you can see what happened as it
[1:14:37] was so shall it
[1:14:38] be and so we understand those
[1:14:41] things and I'd like you to turn with me
[1:14:44] to Luke
[1:14:46] 19 verses
[1:14:50] 5-10 then we'll go to Matthew 18 and to
[1:14:54] Matthew Matthew
[1:15:00] 20 now brother brandham elaborates on
[1:15:03] zakus many times and he said zakus was a
[1:15:06] small man of small
[1:15:08] stature probably about my
[1:15:13] size and it says he had heard about
[1:15:17] Jesus and he heard he was to pass a
[1:15:21] certain
[1:15:22] way and he climbs up a sycamore
[1:15:26] tree because there were so many people
[1:15:29] and he kind of thought well I'll just
[1:15:31] get up here and if he passes by I'll get
[1:15:33] a real good look at
[1:15:37] him and if you ever ask yourself may I
[1:15:40] get a real good look at
[1:15:44] Jesus you have an appointment amen with
[1:15:47] Destiny amen amen and so we find this
[1:15:52] scripture here and we cut in on verse
[1:15:54] five and
[1:15:55] when Jesus came to the place he looked
[1:15:57] up and saw
[1:15:59] him and said unto him zakus make haste
[1:16:04] and come down for today I must abide at
[1:16:08] thy
[1:16:09] house and he made haste and came down
[1:16:12] and received him
[1:16:14] joyfully and when they saw it they all
[1:16:17] murmured saying that he
[1:16:20] was gone to be guested with a man
[1:16:25] that is a
[1:16:28] sinner
[1:16:33] amen God knows
[1:16:35] his and he knows their
[1:16:38] condition and God sees
[1:16:42] righteousness before
[1:16:46] cleansing let me say that again God sees
[1:16:50] righteousness he sees the end of the
[1:16:53] journey before
[1:16:57] cleansing we were born as
[1:17:00] Sinners and the people murmur and look
[1:17:02] at us and say look at these people they
[1:17:04] claim to be quote the bride of Christ
[1:17:06] look at them what a bunch of
[1:17:09] Misfits what a bunch of people that if
[1:17:12] it weren't for the grace of God we would
[1:17:14] be out here probably the worst of the
[1:17:16] people in the crowd amen we would have
[1:17:19] our tattoos and we would have our
[1:17:21] earrings and we would have our hair dos
[1:17:24] and we would doing all of that but God
[1:17:27] rich in
[1:17:28] Mercy placed an elect seed with inside
[1:17:32] of
[1:17:34] you and zakus just wanted to look at him
[1:17:40] told him make
[1:17:43] haste zakus stood and said unto the
[1:17:47] Lord behold Lord the half of my goods I
[1:17:50] give to the poor and if I have taken
[1:17:53] anything from any man by by false
[1:17:55] accusation I restore him fourfold you
[1:17:59] talk about restoration with
[1:18:03] compensation hey there just something
[1:18:05] zakus nobody told him what to do he just
[1:18:08] says oh God he's overwhelmed by God's
[1:18:11] grace the Bible says he that is forgiven
[1:18:16] much loveth
[1:18:18] much that's why I do what I do that's
[1:18:21] why I persevere through what I persevere
[1:18:28] through and Jesus said unto him this day
[1:18:31] is salvation come to this
[1:18:33] house for so much as he
[1:18:37] is he also is the son of
[1:18:41] Abraham
[1:18:43] wow a son of
[1:18:47] Abraham for the son of
[1:18:50] man is come to seek and to save that
[1:18:54] which is lost thank you Lord so I want
[1:18:57] you to think about the mission of the
[1:18:59] son of
[1:19:01] man and I take that title of the
[1:19:04] revealing of the son of man and I want
[1:19:07] you to understand that that son of man
[1:19:09] has a
[1:19:11] mission and I want you all to understand
[1:19:13] that you are a part of that mission
[1:19:17] amen I have come to seek and to save
[1:19:22] that which was lost now I love the
[1:19:24] scripture how they are so detailed
[1:19:27] because you cannot seek and save
[1:19:29] something that was lost unless it was
[1:19:32] once your
[1:19:35] possession where were
[1:19:38] you it didn't come to us until it was
[1:19:43] given to a prophet of God and that
[1:19:46] prophet of God said if you are a son of
[1:19:48] God you always have
[1:19:51] been he said the reason that you can be
[1:19:55] born again is because you have seed he
[1:19:58] said the new birth doesn't change seed
[1:20:01] because you were seed you had the
[1:20:04] ability to be born again somebody say
[1:20:07] praise God because that's what God did
[1:20:10] with
[1:20:12] you Matthew 18:
[1:20:15] 11-
[1:20:23] 14 for those of
[1:20:26] you if I mess up the scriptures or my
[1:20:30] readings my right eye had a surgery
[1:20:36] here several days
[1:20:38] ago it is still
[1:20:41] dilated it's blood red but it's
[1:20:46] healing and this has been a little bit
[1:20:50] of a hard time for me the last several
[1:20:53] weeks because I I haven't felt good I
[1:20:55] went through two surgeries one on the
[1:20:57] nose one on the eyes and now I have
[1:21:00] hearing aids also so I see better I
[1:21:04] smell better and I hear
[1:21:09] better but at the
[1:21:11] moment it's quite blurry and it was very
[1:21:14] difficult me
[1:21:16] yesterday looking and reading my
[1:21:19] scriptures and on the computer because
[1:21:22] it was it was so
[1:21:25] blurry and if any of you have ever had a
[1:21:28] situation like that it's
[1:21:30] frustrating and I said okay Lord I I am
[1:21:33] giving the frustration to you
[1:21:37] otherwise you will just uh get a a bad
[1:21:41] attitude and uh everything so I had to
[1:21:44] humble myself and say okay Lord through
[1:21:47] it
[1:21:48] all you've got it all that's right in
[1:21:52] control amen Matthew 18 vers 11 the
[1:21:55] Bible says for the son of man is come to
[1:21:59] save that which was
[1:22:01] lost how think ye if a man have a
[1:22:04] hundred sheep and one of them be gone
[1:22:06] astray do he not leave the 90 and n and
[1:22:09] go into the mountains and seeketh which
[1:22:12] has gone astray and if so be that he
[1:22:16] find it verily I say unto you he
[1:22:19] rejoices more of that sheep than of the
[1:22:21] 9 and9 which went not a astray amen even
[1:22:27] so it is not the will of your father
[1:22:29] which is in heaven that one of these
[1:22:32] little ones should perish somebody say
[1:22:36] Amen cuz that's God's will for you he
[1:22:38] came to seek and to save that which was
[1:22:40] lost prise the Lord Matthew
[1:22:43] 20 and verse 26-
[1:22:47] 28 but it shall not be so among you but
[1:22:51] whosoever will be great among you
[1:22:54] let him be your
[1:22:56] minister and whosoever will be Chief
[1:23:00] among
[1:23:01] you let him be your
[1:23:05] servant even as the son of man came not
[1:23:07] to be ministered
[1:23:10] unto but to
[1:23:12] minister and to give his
[1:23:16] life a
[1:23:18] ransom for
[1:23:20] many thank you Lord father God
[1:23:25] I do thank you for your
[1:23:28] word I thank you Father father for the
[1:23:32] plan that you have for our
[1:23:35] lives we did not seek
[1:23:38] you we did not go looking for a savior a
[1:23:43] messiah but that Messiah that savior
[1:23:46] came looking for
[1:23:48] us you went to the highways and the
[1:23:50] byways and you've compelled us to come
[1:23:53] in
[1:23:55] and here we are in the midst of this
[1:23:57] loud you see an age where everything is
[1:24:00] so such strife and Chaos
[1:24:04] everywhere but father in the midst of
[1:24:06] the storm we can see you walking on the
[1:24:10] water because the water is the type of
[1:24:13] the people so you're walking in our
[1:24:15] midst and we know that you're here
[1:24:17] father I pray that you will bless your
[1:24:19] word bless your
[1:24:20] ministry around the world father and I
[1:24:23] pray a special bless blessing upon
[1:24:25] Israel at this moment as their enemies
[1:24:27] are encompassed about them I pray you
[1:24:31] the god of
[1:24:33] Abraham Isaac and Jacob the one who has
[1:24:36] watched over that Covenant seed all the
[1:24:40] days father since your Covenant was
[1:24:43] confirmed with Abraham I pray for Israel
[1:24:47] today in Jesus Christ's name amen
[1:25:00] how could I not mention
[1:25:02] today although my sermon is on the
[1:25:06] revealing of the son of man how could I
[1:25:08] not mention to all of you and maybe some
[1:25:11] of you don't know that Israel is at
[1:25:14] War they've been
[1:25:17] attacked an unprovoked
[1:25:23] attack and their prime
[1:25:26] minister Benjamin
[1:25:28] Netanyahu has
[1:25:30] declared
[1:25:32] war and so I want you to be
[1:25:37] aware this morning because this is a
[1:25:41] Biblical
[1:25:44] prophecy and though the world is looking
[1:25:46] at this and you remember last Sunday
[1:25:48] when I told you it was the beginning of
[1:25:51] yam Kapur
[1:25:54] and did you know that 50 years ago to
[1:25:57] the day of even this
[1:26:01] attack was on the dates of the time of
[1:26:05] the yam Kapur War 50 years ago I told
[1:26:09] you that God does things to
[1:26:11] Israel on feast
[1:26:14] days because we know that the Bible says
[1:26:17] these feast
[1:26:18] days are appointed
[1:26:21] Times They Are to give you examp
[1:26:24] examples and things for you to look at
[1:26:27] and we realize Jesus was born on a feast
[1:26:32] day he was
[1:26:34] crucified on a feast day he rose again
[1:26:38] on a feast day his Spirit came back on a
[1:26:42] feast
[1:26:44] day excuse me so we understand that God
[1:26:49] is keeping all of his
[1:26:51] appointments but I didn't want to just
[1:26:54] take all of my focus this morning and go
[1:26:58] just on Israel but I do want to tie some
[1:27:01] things in and if you will let me have my
[1:27:04] Liberty this morning to show you a few
[1:27:07] things because the prophet of God ties
[1:27:11] Israel and the church
[1:27:15] together he preaches uh sermons like the
[1:27:20] 144,000 and the 10 virgins
[1:27:24] he goes and preaches about Israel and he
[1:27:27] says what you see God doing to Israel
[1:27:30] watch because he will also do that with
[1:27:32] the
[1:27:40] church so we see these things
[1:27:45] happening and it's happening even right
[1:27:47] now as we
[1:27:49] speak there are
[1:27:51] Rockets there are gunfights
[1:27:54] there are bombs going
[1:27:57] off and yet I believe that you're this
[1:28:02] is all for a
[1:28:04] purpose now remember that brother
[1:28:06] Brenham says that Israel is God's time
[1:28:08] piece and so I want to take this time
[1:28:11] piece for just a moment and share with
[1:28:14] you what brother Brenham says
[1:28:16] 1953 in questions and answers on
[1:28:20] Genesis do you believe that the Jews
[1:28:23] Jews returned to Palestine is a
[1:28:25] fulfillment of Bible
[1:28:27] prophecy we heard you going to Palestine
[1:28:30] is that true yes yes sir let me tell you
[1:28:33] something one of the greatest if you
[1:28:34] want to see what time of year it is look
[1:28:37] on the
[1:28:38] calendar if you want to see what time it
[1:28:41] is look at the clock if you want to see
[1:28:43] what day you're living in look where the
[1:28:47] Jews are that's God's time piece so
[1:28:49] there's how something about what's
[1:28:51] happening in Israel right now that is
[1:28:54] letting you know the time is here am
[1:28:58] amen the time
[1:29:01] piece and look the very night the very
[1:29:04] day that the angel of the Lord met me in
[1:29:08] 1946 on May the
[1:29:10] 7th at Greens Mill
[1:29:13] Indiana that same day the Treaty of
[1:29:16] Peace was signed for the
[1:29:18] Jews and they were established a nation
[1:29:21] for the first time in 25
[1:29:24] 100
[1:29:28] years do you think this was
[1:29:33] coincidence I'll have you to
[1:29:35] know that it is a sign of the time
[1:29:40] because just as Paul who was sent first
[1:29:43] to the house of Israel they rejected the
[1:29:47] gospel and he says now you must turn and
[1:29:52] go to the Gentiles he says because they
[1:29:55] pushed it away but God blinded them oh
[1:29:59] you talk about the grace of God God
[1:30:02] blinded his own that he could take a
[1:30:05] gentile Nation a gentile
[1:30:08] people hallelujah we're talking about
[1:30:11] you and I right now and so at the
[1:30:14] closing of that dispensation of going to
[1:30:18] the Jews now there's a message and Paul
[1:30:22] says I turn and now go to the
[1:30:25] Gentiles so we see that at this timing
[1:30:29] that there was a a passing of the
[1:30:32] message from the Jew to the Gentile amen
[1:30:37] but that Gentile dispensation is for
[1:30:40] just a period of time that's right how
[1:30:43] many of you know that the Gentile
[1:30:45] dispensation is just for a few days and
[1:30:49] God is fixing to turn back to Israel Hal
[1:30:54] Hallelujah so we can see all of this is
[1:30:57] in God's timing amen you want to know
[1:30:59] what time it is God's time piece is
[1:31:03] Israel in the recognizing your day and
[1:31:06] its
[1:31:06] message
[1:31:10] 64 you we are dealing today on a Sunday
[1:31:13] school lesson but I want you to realize
[1:31:15] and
[1:31:17] recognize the time that we're
[1:31:19] living we're just about to run
[1:31:22] out and as you see and then by this you
[1:31:26] should know the very hour and time and
[1:31:29] sign the message that you are to
[1:31:33] receive brother Brenham was very much
[1:31:36] aware of current
[1:31:39] events in fact brother Brenan would take
[1:31:42] current events he would call them modern
[1:31:45] events he says are made known by
[1:31:49] prophecy therefore he could look at a
[1:31:52] modern event that was happen happening
[1:31:54] and say uh this is found in the
[1:31:57] scripture and he goes to the scripture
[1:32:00] how many of you know that the what the
[1:32:03] Bible uh
[1:32:05] foretells that is going to happen must
[1:32:08] come to pass it might take thousands of
[1:32:11] years hundreds of years it might look as
[1:32:15] though that God has forgotten but he did
[1:32:20] not forget he does not forget he is not
[1:32:24] like
[1:32:25] man he doesn't start something and then
[1:32:27] get
[1:32:28] distracted everything that is happening
[1:32:31] and may I say this to all of you today
[1:32:34] everything that is happening to you
[1:32:37] right now is for a purpose
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:46] hallelujah
[1:32:48] amen in the 10 virgins and 144,000 Jews
[1:32:56] and now you can look and look magazine
[1:32:58] in life and them showing the pictures of
[1:33:00] them returning back didn't Jesus say it
[1:33:03] when you see the Fig Tree putting forth
[1:33:06] its buds how many of you know that the
[1:33:08] Fig Tree resembles or
[1:33:12] typifies Israel so now watch when Israel
[1:33:16] brother Braham said you think it's
[1:33:19] coincidence that the very same hour the
[1:33:22] very same moment that Israel is being
[1:33:25] declared as a nation God is meeting with
[1:33:28] me giving me a
[1:33:31] message now watch follow along Jews have
[1:33:36] always been the Fig Tree this generation
[1:33:39] should not pass until all these things
[1:33:42] be
[1:33:43] fulfilled continuing on the next quote
[1:33:47] in the 10 virgins the real Jews was
[1:33:50] gathering into Palestine again and just
[1:33:54] exactly what the prophet said Ishmael
[1:33:56] and
[1:33:57] Isaac were were at one another's throats
[1:34:00] always
[1:34:01] fighting predicted they'd be there in
[1:34:04] the last day and there they said ishmail
[1:34:07] right here and about a city block here
[1:34:10] and there is an Isaac both of them
[1:34:13] mohammadans and Jews fighting one
[1:34:16] another in a No Man's
[1:34:20] Land continuing on
[1:34:24] now to see whether the this
[1:34:27] message that we got is connected with it
[1:34:30] or
[1:34:31] not the very hour that Israel was signed
[1:34:34] to be a
[1:34:36] nation remember I read you the quote in
[1:34:39] 53 now he's seven years
[1:34:43] later and he's preaching this
[1:34:46] sermon we see whether this message we
[1:34:49] got is connected with it or not the very
[1:34:53] hour is signed to be a nation is the
[1:34:56] very same hour very same day very same
[1:34:58] month everything
[1:35:01] else I was at Greens Mill
[1:35:04] Indiana when that angel there appeared
[1:35:07] to me and sent me out on the field with
[1:35:10] this after he had met me down on the
[1:35:13] river and told me what would take place
[1:35:15] then commissioned me 11 years later at
[1:35:18] the same hour that Israel was signed in
[1:35:21] as a nation it's all
[1:35:24] connected
[1:35:28] together
[1:35:29] Hallelujah so what is happening in
[1:35:32] Israel is connecting understand we are
[1:35:36] now finishing up the ending of the
[1:35:39] Gentile
[1:35:40] dispensation we have men such as
[1:35:43] Jonathan
[1:35:44] KH who is uh a Messianic
[1:35:51] Jew and he's looking
[1:35:54] into the Old and New
[1:35:57] Testament and he's looking at times and
[1:36:01] signs and he's realizing wow look at
[1:36:05] what God is
[1:36:06] doing he's letting the world know but
[1:36:09] does it make them
[1:36:14] change will Israel will this war will it
[1:36:19] make people change
[1:36:22] no they will continue on in fact when
[1:36:25] God fulfills prophecy many of them sit
[1:36:28] there and scratch their head and wonder
[1:36:31] what has come to pass but there's others
[1:36:34] who are elect of God who are C Gene have
[1:36:37] got an ability they can see something
[1:36:41] others cannot they can hear a voice that
[1:36:44] others cannot they can see a picture
[1:36:48] that others do not
[1:36:50] see how many of you can bear witness of
[1:36:53] that amen
[1:37:00] amen
[1:37:01] again I have two more quotes on the 10
[1:37:06] virgins the angel of the Lord is on
[1:37:09] earth now see he's moving around fixing
[1:37:13] everything for the coming of the
[1:37:16] Lord then he talks about how two
[1:37:18] Messengers go down to
[1:37:21] Sodom and brother Brenham happens to
[1:37:24] mention he said two
[1:37:26] Messengers such as our modern-day Billy
[1:37:28] Graham and Earl
[1:37:31] Roberts and he says but they were sent
[1:37:33] to Sodom but he said there'll be one
[1:37:36] that stays with
[1:37:37] Abraham I want all of you to understand
[1:37:40] here we are in the midst of fulfillment
[1:37:43] God has sent his two Messengers down to
[1:37:45] Sodom and they were great
[1:37:47] Messengers I tell you if I remember the
[1:37:51] the first time I was ever into the pr
[1:37:54] presence there of Billy Graham at a at a
[1:37:59] campaign a crusade of his in Anaheim
[1:38:04] California and it was a youth
[1:38:07] convention and I was about as far away
[1:38:10] from him as brother Michel and I are
[1:38:14] from one
[1:38:16] another and I saw him stand there and I
[1:38:20] knew I was in the presence of some one
[1:38:23] very
[1:38:25] special and he looked out across that
[1:38:28] great
[1:38:29] stadium and he says I want to talk to
[1:38:32] you today about the Jesus Revolution
[1:38:36] that is happening in America
[1:38:39] today and as he spoke these words and he
[1:38:42] was saying I want all of you to know
[1:38:45] that God is calling you to
[1:38:49] repentance and how that he wants you to
[1:38:52] come to him
[1:38:54] but now understand this let's not
[1:38:57] concentrate on The Messengers to Sodom
[1:39:01] let's concentrate on one that stayed
[1:39:03] with Abraham are you f are you spiritual
[1:39:06] enough to catch this
[1:39:09] correlation The Godly one MDC stayed
[1:39:14] with
[1:39:20] Abraham and the two angels went down
[1:39:22] there and preached to them and brought
[1:39:25] that little bitty group out sleeping
[1:39:27] virgin see all right but the one Angel
[1:39:30] stayed with
[1:39:31] Abraham this Angels preached down here a
[1:39:34] modern day Billy gaham and then pulled
[1:39:37] them out paragraph 102 same sermon and
[1:39:41] the angel that stood with Abraham had
[1:39:44] his back to the tent and said Abraham
[1:39:47] where is your
[1:39:49] wife
[1:39:51] Sarah how' he know he was married he was
[1:39:55] married how do he know he had a wife how
[1:39:57] do he know his name her name was Sarah
[1:40:00] and she's in the tent behind
[1:40:03] him and he says I
[1:40:06] see you see who Angel was I made you a
[1:40:11] promise I'm going to visit you according
[1:40:13] to the time of life may I stop there for
[1:40:16] a moment it was according to a time of
[1:40:19] life God spoke listen to me I'm going to
[1:40:22] just RAB it Trail here for a moment
[1:40:25] feeling LED of the spirit God spoke to
[1:40:28] Abraham and told him I'm going to give
[1:40:29] you
[1:40:30] seed I'm going to give you seed and
[1:40:33] you'll be the father of many nations the
[1:40:35] people will call you blessed and yet it
[1:40:38] took all these years later and you know
[1:40:42] what he did not mention her
[1:40:46] name he didn't say and it's going to be
[1:40:49] through
[1:40:51] Sarah do you understand that
[1:40:54] when you look at the Early times when
[1:40:56] God speaks to
[1:40:57] Abraham he tells him you're going to
[1:41:00] have seed now we it's all
[1:41:02] inferred it's all inferred that it's
[1:41:06] going to be through his wife but guess
[1:41:08] what she can't
[1:41:10] conceive she's she's
[1:41:13] Barren and they go all these years as
[1:41:17] husband and wife and after him getting
[1:41:21] the promise he keeps coming to Sarah
[1:41:24] every morning do you feel anything
[1:41:27] different she said no I don't he said
[1:41:31] keep knitting them
[1:41:35] booties I want all of you to understand
[1:41:38] that we have a father of
[1:41:40] Abraham who is the father of Assa and he
[1:41:44] didn't look at the
[1:41:48] conditions he looks at the
[1:41:50] promise and I want all of you to
[1:41:53] understand stand regardless of your
[1:41:55] conditions and regardless of the things
[1:41:57] you are going through God is going to
[1:42:00] have a bride God is going to deliver you
[1:42:04] he's going to bring you to where he
[1:42:07] promised and he that began a good work
[1:42:10] in you shall finish it thank you
[1:42:17] Lord so it was an appointed
[1:42:20] time they went through all these years
[1:42:24] years of trying to do this and that and
[1:42:26] he
[1:42:27] tried to bring the promise of God to
[1:42:31] pass but may I say this God doesn't need
[1:42:34] your
[1:42:35] help you can try to help God all you
[1:42:38] want well if I if I do this more and I
[1:42:40] do that more and everything maybe I'll
[1:42:43] find favor in the eyes of God there's
[1:42:45] one thing that God does require of you
[1:42:48] and that is for you to be more sincere
[1:42:51] amen that's what the prophet of God was
[1:42:53] told by the angel he said now this third
[1:42:56] pull he said watch it's something very
[1:43:02] secret it's something so Sovereign I
[1:43:06] must not say much about it because if
[1:43:09] I'm not careful I cause carnal
[1:43:14] impersonations I want all of you to
[1:43:16] understand that the third pole every
[1:43:19] time it was manifested it was not in
[1:43:22] church was not in a prayer
[1:43:24] line it was out there among everyday
[1:43:28] life it was out there when he was just
[1:43:31] doing this and fishing and hunting
[1:43:34] and taking his wife to the doctor
[1:43:39] Etc but when there was a
[1:43:43] need I want you to understand God is God
[1:43:47] he's a
[1:43:48] Healer he's a
[1:43:51] deliverer but there must be
[1:43:53] need and many times we don't call him on
[1:43:56] the scene because we don't have a need
[1:43:58] and your need is what makes him
[1:44:01] God I need a Healer all right I'm the
[1:44:05] god that heals all your
[1:44:10] diseases it is that need that calls him
[1:44:19] down do we understand
[1:44:24] with a full
[1:44:27] capacity of just what has happened in
[1:44:30] our day when he says just as there was a
[1:44:34] messiah sign
[1:44:38] given he says I'll turn my
[1:44:42] back as it
[1:44:44] was in the days of Abraham with Sarah in
[1:44:47] the
[1:44:49] tent now brother Brenham says it's thus
[1:44:51] sayith the Lord this is the last sign
[1:44:54] you'll not receive another sign after
[1:44:58] this oh many of us were not there there
[1:45:01] was probably just a few of you that were
[1:45:05] so blessed in your early
[1:45:08] youth to be able to go to a meeting to
[1:45:12] be there to see him walk to the platform
[1:45:16] to hear him take his
[1:45:19] text I remember there was a sister that
[1:45:22] went to our church
[1:45:25] Flagstaff and her husband left her
[1:45:29] because of this
[1:45:32] message she lived in
[1:45:36] Prescot
[1:45:38] and Sister Irene
[1:45:44] McCracken and she tried to raise her son
[1:45:47] up the best that she
[1:45:50] could and she'd been seeking
[1:45:55] God to make a way for her to get to
[1:45:57] God's prophet and hear him preach she'd
[1:46:00] heard about it giving her life to it but
[1:46:03] she wanted to go to a
[1:46:05] meeting and she got down on her knees as
[1:46:08] I best remember her testimony she began
[1:46:12] to pray and call upon God and said God
[1:46:15] make a
[1:46:16] way
[1:46:18] because I would like to be able to go to
[1:46:20] the meeting
[1:46:23] and I would like to hear that Prophet
[1:46:25] preach I'd like to be there in
[1:46:28] person she got done praying didn't feel
[1:46:31] anything special except that she had
[1:46:34] intercession with God and it wound up
[1:46:38] that just a few moments later the phone
[1:46:40] rang one of her Christian Associates
[1:46:44] said hey I've heard that William
[1:46:46] brandham is coming to
[1:46:49] Arizona said would you like to go with
[1:46:52] us to the meeting now watch God working
[1:46:54] on both
[1:47:01] ends she hung up the phone she got so
[1:47:05] excited that she cried out with a loud
[1:47:08] voice is there no bomb in
[1:47:14] Gilead didn't know why she said
[1:47:17] it went to the
[1:47:20] meeting sat in the congregation
[1:47:23] she watched The Prophet come out she
[1:47:26] watched the way he carried his
[1:47:29] Bible she watched how every
[1:47:32] movement and she said oh I will never
[1:47:36] forget he
[1:47:38] says he looked over the
[1:47:41] congregation he says I feel led today to
[1:47:46] preach and he looked right at her
[1:47:54] is there no bomb in
[1:48:01] Gilead excuse
[1:48:03] me God is a god of
[1:48:07] Supernatural I'll tell you the closer we
[1:48:09] get
[1:48:10] to God the more of the supernatural we
[1:48:14] we should be seeing Among Us that's
[1:48:16] right why because we are changing
[1:48:19] Ministry I want you to understand that
[1:48:22] the min Ministry of Jesus Christ you
[1:48:24] watch brother Brenham said he had three
[1:48:27] polls and he says that the first poll
[1:48:30] and he says what is it the sign in the
[1:48:33] hand right and he says watch the
[1:48:35] healings and all of the things but he
[1:48:37] says and then the second pull the
[1:48:40] Discerning of spirits behold an
[1:48:42] Israelite in whom there is no
[1:48:45] G he says because I told you your
[1:48:49] name you believe greater things shall
[1:48:52] you
[1:48:54] see because the ministry will change
[1:48:56] it'll go
[1:48:58] greater I want you to understand and I
[1:49:01] trust that each one of you understand
[1:49:02] this with me and I pray that the same
[1:49:05] thing is happening to you that's
[1:49:07] happening to me the message is becoming
[1:49:09] greater now than it's ever been amen it
[1:49:13] is unfolding in a way that I'll tell you
[1:49:15] there are times I cannot contain itall
[1:49:23] becoming so real messages that I have
[1:49:27] read over and over and
[1:49:30] underlined I read it again it's a whole
[1:49:32] new
[1:49:33] message that's though I'd never read it
[1:49:36] before my Bible's doing the same thing
[1:49:40] I'm reading out of my Bible I'm reading
[1:49:42] out of the message and everything I'm
[1:49:44] thinking oh my why haven't I read this
[1:49:48] before my wife and I having devotions
[1:49:50] the other morning and we were just
[1:49:52] finish finishing up the last couple
[1:49:54] Pages cuz we read from the SE Seven
[1:49:57] Seals and we're finishing the Sixth
[1:50:00] Seal and brother Brenan was talking
[1:50:02] about a dream that he
[1:50:05] had and as we read this my wife and I
[1:50:08] were very much aware because as a young
[1:50:12] man as a young man when I just came to
[1:50:15] the massage God gave me a dream and here
[1:50:18] that my dream and brother brenham's
[1:50:20] dream correlated one with another
[1:50:23] and I said Sandy as much as I've read
[1:50:26] all of this and I know I've read this
[1:50:28] before but now I said his dream and my
[1:50:31] dream they
[1:50:37] match I remember
[1:50:41] I we traveled with brother Billy Paul
[1:50:44] and Brother Joseph in Europe and taking
[1:50:46] them to visit ministers throughout
[1:50:50] Europe and I told Brother Billy Paul the
[1:50:53] dream he and Brother
[1:50:57] Joseph and I got so
[1:51:00] overcome and it's hard for me to tell
[1:51:02] the dreams because they're so
[1:51:08] personal and when I got done telling the
[1:51:11] dream brother Billy
[1:51:13] Paul very deeply moved he said brother
[1:51:16] Ron you saw my
[1:51:18] daddy you saw my daddy
[1:51:25] he wrote me not long
[1:51:27] ago I say not long ago brother Robert
[1:51:30] could have been five years ago seven
[1:51:32] years he said brother Ron I have taken
[1:51:35] your dream and shared it with people all
[1:51:39] over the world I hope you don't mind I
[1:51:42] said no brother Billy I don't
[1:51:45] mind and I'm not going to tell the dream
[1:51:48] but it was the dream of the wedding
[1:51:50] supper and we were there and every
[1:51:52] everyone's getting their rewards
[1:51:55] and I'll tell you the end of the
[1:51:58] dream if you don't mind is it okay can
[1:52:02] I everyone had gotten their rewards and
[1:52:05] one by one they called
[1:52:07] names whether it be your name or her
[1:52:10] name or whatever and everyone that came
[1:52:13] up from the least to the greatest and
[1:52:17] each one that came forward after their
[1:52:20] name we all said praise God if anyone
[1:52:23] deserves a reward that brother does oh
[1:52:25] God give him a great reward and everyone
[1:52:28] kept getting better and better and there
[1:52:30] was no
[1:52:31] time uh you know no issue on time why we
[1:52:35] were in eternity right it was it was
[1:52:38] God's
[1:52:39] time and I remember they called my name
[1:52:42] I came before the Lord and a crown was
[1:52:44] placed upon my head and the crown had
[1:52:46] velvet on the inside of it I felt the
[1:52:48] weight of the crown and the crown fit
[1:52:50] perfectly it didn't slide down and and
[1:52:52] be caught over my
[1:52:54] ears and I thought how does he know my
[1:52:57] hat
[1:52:59] size my hat size he knows the numbers of
[1:53:04] the hairs on my head that's right even
[1:53:07] though they're few to be numbered
[1:53:12] now but I felt the weight of the crown I
[1:53:15] sat back down every one of us we got our
[1:53:18] crowns we sat down and they finally
[1:53:21] called the name Willi you marry
[1:53:26] brandom they said it again William marry
[1:53:28] and brandham there was no movement there
[1:53:31] was where is he where is he we all began
[1:53:33] to look and the people across the table
[1:53:37] from me were looking Beyond me to
[1:53:41] commotion or something in my back so I
[1:53:43] turned in my chair to look and there he
[1:53:46] was Now understand we had crowns and we
[1:53:49] had
[1:53:50] robes we all looked the
[1:53:53] same and he was walking away and I could
[1:53:57] see through the texture of the robe the
[1:54:01] Contour of his muscles and I could see
[1:54:04] they were contorting and I could see
[1:54:07] that he was crying he had his head down
[1:54:11] although physically I didn't see the
[1:54:13] front of him and it took two brothers to
[1:54:17] go and one got his left arm and one got
[1:54:19] the right arm and turn him around and
[1:54:21] then I saw he was weeping tears
[1:54:24] streaming down his
[1:54:26] face and we're all going oh praise God
[1:54:29] praise God if anyone deserves a reward
[1:54:34] it's the seventh angel
[1:54:36] messenger if it weren't for
[1:54:40] him they came before the Lord
[1:54:43] Jesus the crown was placed upon his
[1:54:47] head and we all rejoice and all of a
[1:54:50] sudden he very quickly
[1:54:53] he put it at his feet and he said I'm
[1:54:56] not
[1:54:59] worthy he placed his crown at his feet
[1:55:02] and one by one and I thought why didn't
[1:55:04] I think of
[1:55:06] that as though I deserve a crown as
[1:55:09] though I get a reward for something that
[1:55:11] I've done it's all by grace for by grace
[1:55:14] are we saved through faith and the faith
[1:55:16] that you have is a gift of God lest any
[1:55:18] man should
[1:55:20] boast that's right
[1:55:23] and we all and I felt ashamed now to
[1:55:25] have my crown and we all one by one not
[1:55:31] hurriedly but very reverently and
[1:55:33] sovereignly we all came before the
[1:55:36] throne and now crowns are all around his
[1:55:40] throne his throne now has to elevate you
[1:55:43] understand the mountain of crowns are
[1:55:45] getting so great so great that they that
[1:55:49] that his crown actually elevates it
[1:55:51] keeps getting higher and higher until
[1:55:55] there's just a massive amount of crowns
[1:55:58] around him and I want you to understand
[1:56:00] that when Jesus was here he was
[1:56:04] lowly and
[1:56:07] simple he was not
[1:56:10] recognized he was
[1:56:13] humble but when he stood out of that
[1:56:17] crown and we began to worship Him He was
[1:56:22] Regal he was Royal he was King he was
[1:56:27] King theophany he was King Jesus he was
[1:56:31] King and he wanted to be recognized and
[1:56:35] worshiped as king
[1:56:39] amen he had his
[1:56:42] robe and he had the train here and he
[1:56:46] grabs the
[1:56:47] train as a bride will grab her Train
[1:56:51] sometimes and hold it up well he grabs
[1:56:54] the train of his robe and as he does
[1:56:58] he's looking out and we're all looking
[1:57:00] at him and we're worshiping him and
[1:57:02] we're giving him praise and we're giving
[1:57:04] God glory and he wanted to be
[1:57:09] glorified and he looks down at all of us
[1:57:13] and when he does he makes a big sweeping
[1:57:15] turn and when he does and he makes his
[1:57:18] final turn all of a sudden it became
[1:57:21] something nuclear something so powerful
[1:57:23] it was a blast of light
[1:57:28] whoa the women's hair blew
[1:57:32] back there was a power it was so a
[1:57:36] bright light brighter than the sun yet
[1:57:38] hurt not your
[1:57:40] eyes you felt the glory of
[1:57:44] God my brother my sister one day we will
[1:57:48] experience that amen and it wasn't until
[1:57:51] after I had even dream that dream did I
[1:57:54] read where brother Bram said one day we
[1:57:55] will lay our
[1:57:57] crowns at his feet
[1:58:06] that's praise
[1:58:08] God I told you that I would just kind of
[1:58:12] take and walk through a few things if
[1:58:15] you don't mind if I take my Liberty
[1:58:19] am brother renham said watch Russia
[1:58:23] King of the
[1:58:24] North you all remember that he talks
[1:58:28] about how to watch Russia King of the
[1:58:33] North and he says one day Russia will go
[1:58:36] down after the oil and we all know why
[1:58:38] they went after
[1:58:41] Ukraine because they wanted the physical
[1:58:43] resources in
[1:58:47] Ukraine and he said there'd be three
[1:58:50] isms naziism
[1:58:52] fascism and communism and they all three
[1:58:55] wind up in
[1:58:57] communism how many of you know he said
[1:58:59] that but he says Don't Fear communism he
[1:59:04] said communism is a hand in the tool of
[1:59:07] God and communism will never rule the
[1:59:10] world communism is what God is raising
[1:59:13] up to destroy Rome he said watch
[1:59:17] romanism of all the bamboo curtain Iron
[1:59:20] Curtain the one you better watch out and
[1:59:22] I'll tell you what he's hitting the news
[1:59:25] the pope is getting here and guess what
[1:59:26] he's doing ordaining women into the
[1:59:29] ministry he's accepting
[1:59:31] lgbtq why he is a perverter of and and
[1:59:36] his house is a house of unclean birds do
[1:59:39] you understand every filth every
[1:59:41] abominable thing is in him why so now
[1:59:45] romanism is bringing everything in why
[1:59:49] he's going to rule the world not
[1:59:52] communism don't fear
[1:59:59] communism restoration of the Bride tree
[2:00:01] brother Brenham
[2:00:02] 62 don't you never fear
[2:00:05] communism communism is a god Godless
[2:00:08] move but you hear some of these
[2:00:10] preachers stand in the Pulpit condemning
[2:00:12] communism
[2:00:14] communism I don't believe in it either
[2:00:17] that's exactly contrary to the to God's
[2:00:20] word there's no place in the Bible say
[2:00:22] says that it'll be that way the Bible
[2:00:24] says romanism the Catholic Church will
[2:00:26] swallow the
[2:00:29] world now hang on here for just a second
[2:00:32] I'm going to I'm going to Rabbit Trail
[2:00:39] again I just wonder if any kind of
[2:00:43] romanism Babylonian
[2:00:46] teachings or anything that has to do
[2:00:49] with the Catholic church or creepy now
[2:00:52] and being accepted among message
[2:00:59] churches because I wonder if the
[2:01:02] ministers within the message are reading
[2:01:04] the same message I'm reading I want to
[2:01:06] ask you what part of Babylon do you want
[2:01:08] a part
[2:01:14] of oh
[2:01:16] God we got all kinds of little isms and
[2:01:19] different
[2:01:20] things rising up up and one going over
[2:01:23] here and pretty soon next thing you know
[2:01:25] everything is Christmas and everything
[2:01:26] is
[2:01:27] Easter oh my
[2:01:30] goodness comes in subtle so easily

[2:02:15] otherwise I'll pick the one that's
[2:02:16] closest to the hole got to be my ball
[2:02:22] okay just thought I'd throw that in
[2:02:26] there
[2:02:28] romanism how about
[2:02:30] nanism how about
[2:02:35] bism how about a little bit of bism and
[2:02:39] nickan ISM I remember when we had our
[2:02:43] church on

[2:03:08] back 40 just to get there to come to
[2:03:12] church so one of the brothers said I
[2:03:14] think it was brother

[2:05:08] would feel to come to me if there was an
[2:05:11] issue that I wouldn't be one that would
[2:05:14] just say who do you have a right uh to
[2:05:17] come against me well I'm the pastor I'm
[2:05:19] the ultimate and on hey

[2:06:22] think well why why waste your
[2:06:25] time really why do you kick at a barking
[2:06:32] dog stop it so I get these letters I get
[2:06:38] them I'd like to have some of their
[2:06:41] address sometime or at least know their
[2:06:43] name but most of the time they even got
[2:06:46] the grit to put their name to it brother
[2:06:48] Ron I want to tell you here's where
[2:06:50] you're wrong and this and that said this
[2:06:52] the other day
[2:06:57] and
[2:07:01] anyway
[2:07:02] now can I get back to my
[2:07:08] subject one thing that I know and
[2:07:10] brother
[2:07:13] Tim when God got a hold of me in the
[2:07:16] beaches of San Diego of
[2:07:19] California and he opened my eyes of
[2:07:22] understanding I did not see brother Ezra
[2:07:25] William
[2:07:30] brandham I saw somebody
[2:07:36] greater I saw a son of
[2:07:39] man
[2:07:41] revealing the son of
[2:07:45] man I have
[2:07:48] never
[2:07:49] found discrep IES within the
[2:07:53] message in this sense listen to me
[2:07:56] because we're all human we all make
[2:07:59] mistakes brother Brenham said one time
[2:08:02] 700 and meant to say 7,000 in the Seven
[2:08:06] Seals they send him in questions and
[2:08:08] answers I think he gets four or five
[2:08:10] questions brother brand did you mean to
[2:08:13] say 7,000 instead of
[2:08:16] 700 Yeah Yeah well yeah we all do that
[2:08:20] we say than
[2:08:22] according to our understanding let me
[2:08:24] tell you I have had God give me such
[2:08:28] great Revelation I probably wouldn't
[2:08:31] fellowship with me the guy that got
[2:08:33] converted in California amen why because
[2:08:38] you don't know nothing man just hang on
[2:08:42] the unfolding of the word just just keep
[2:08:44] going just keep
[2:08:46] reading how many of you say Amen to that
[2:08:49] keep reading amen keep listening
[2:08:52] oh you might say well he he he said um
[2:08:55] Body Soul spirit and then with the
[2:08:58] opening of the seals he says Body Spirit
[2:09:00] Soul corrects
[2:09:03] it hey brother Brenham there's another
[2:09:06] quote where he says I can prove to you
[2:09:09] in the Bible that all of God's prophets
[2:09:12] made their
[2:09:13] mistakes he said but God makes no
[2:09:17] mistakes that's let me tell you this
[2:09:20] revealing of the son of man what we call
[2:09:22] the message of the hour is nothing else
[2:09:24] than Jesus Christ making himself known
[2:09:28] to his
[2:09:29] people this is the office this is the
[2:09:32] mission of the son of man I came to seek

[2:13:28] it and I said okay that's it I ask God
[2:13:31] as sincere if God rejected me that's
[2:13:35] fine okay God I don't need
[2:13:40] you and here I was in these people's
[2:13:46] house and they wanted to witness to my
[2:13:48] brother and I about Christ
[2:13:51] I didn't want to hear
[2:13:53] it and the more that they began to ask
[2:13:56] questions excuse me my brother ask
[2:14:00] questions and I understand I don't want
[2:14:03] to I sat in the corner I got as far away
[2:14:06] from them as I could I sat in the corner
[2:14:10] they brought some herbal tea and I just
[2:14:12] tried to be cool and
[2:14:15] mellow and not let this stuff affect
[2:14:19] me but one of the
[2:14:22] things was and if any of you have ever
[2:14:25] done drugs and I pray to God that none
[2:14:27] of you
[2:14:28] do
[2:14:30] because nowadays even the
[2:14:33] drugs that we had 40 and 50 years
[2:14:38] ago is
[2:14:40] nothing Satan has
[2:14:43] refined his cocaine his crack his fent
[2:14:48] andol one little yeah yeah you Superman
[2:14:52] Man you big bad you are tough you hey
[2:14:57] yeah come on man and next thing you
[2:15:00] know okay Satan's got
[2:15:08] you one's too many and a thousand's not
[2:15:14] enough and here I
[2:15:17] was where Satan had a grip on me
[2:15:23] I don't know if any of you know what
[2:15:24] addiction is but it's a horrible
[2:15:34] thing these two were some of the largest
[2:15:38] drug dealers in Southern California that
[2:15:40] got
[2:15:41] converted so they could tell they looked
[2:15:44] at me they can smell it they see the
[2:15:47] influence they didn't condemn me
[2:15:53] and they began to say some things and I
[2:15:55] sat over there first thing that I
[2:15:57] realized when I walked into the house
[2:15:59] and this is God's
[2:16:01] truth when I walked into the house
[2:16:03] immediately I came down in drug
[2:16:06] terminology that means I came down I
[2:16:09] came out from under the influence of
[2:16:11] this
[2:16:12] drug and I said wow something is unusual
[2:16:18] here because I should be high for hours
[2:16:22] hours well it wound up that they began
[2:16:25] to my brother ask questions and they
[2:16:27] answer his questions and guess what it's
[2:16:29] going right over my brother and hitting
[2:16:32] me in the
[2:16:34] corner boom boom boom boom boom
[2:16:39] boom and I think one of them saw it and
[2:16:41] I'm sitting over there trying to shake
[2:16:43] all this stuff off and what do you what
[2:16:45] are you guys doing to
[2:16:47] me they said hey would you like us to
[2:16:49] pray for you
[2:16:54] no do you want us to lay hands on you
[2:16:58] no I was sincere no I don't know no I'm
[2:17:02] happy right where I'm at
[2:17:04] no and then they but they kept they kept
[2:17:07] persevering I don't know they just did
[2:17:10] well would you like us to pray for you
[2:17:14] to have the desire fresh to lay hands on
[2:17:16] you
[2:17:19] no and then one of them said this
[2:17:21] magical word do you believe it's a
[2:17:24] sickness
[2:17:27] yes the Bible says lay hands on the
[2:17:31] sick oh I was

[2:20:23] heart
[2:20:26] amen I said I
[2:20:29] believe he's a prophet and I don't even
[2:20:32] have to hear his sermon because I saw
[2:20:36] the sermon
[2:20:38] lived let your life be a
[2:20:41] sermon let your
[2:20:43] life let the joy of god of what you

[2:20:57] not loving what you
[2:21:00] believe I don't know about you but I
[2:21:02] love this amen I feel honored that God
[2:21:08] would open my
[2:21:09] eyes thank you Lord amen and let me see
[2:21:14] the
[2:21:15] Splendor of the mysteries of
[2:21:18] God all of the Loose Ends
[2:21:21] God bringing them together he said this
[2:21:23] seventh angel messenger he's
[2:21:26] gotten specific
[2:21:29] mystery but he
[2:21:30] says they probed it this here's the
[2:21:34] truth they probed at that here's the
[2:21:38] truth and this
[2:21:40] message excuse
[2:21:43] me has made like the great pieces to a
[2:21:47] great puzzle
[2:21:51] when it was all said and
[2:21:53] done there was a
[2:21:58] picture you know who it was Jonathan it
[2:22:01] was
[2:22:03] him it was him the Lord
[2:22:07] Jesus when I look at this
[2:22:09] message I see
[2:22:12] him oh yes God used the prophet
[2:22:15] messenger but get your eyes off of The
[2:22:18] Veil The Veil is what keeps many people
[2:22:22] from seeing the god behind the
[2:22:34] veil and when he opened my
[2:22:36] [Music]
[2:22:40] eyes I fell in
[2:22:43] love amen
[2:22:48] [Music]
[2:22:50] it wasn't
[2:22:53] Doctrine it was
[2:22:56] love I fell in
[2:22:58] love I'm in love with him now today more
[2:23:02] than I ever have been have I made
[2:23:04] mistakes sure will I make more most
[2:23:09] likely but I know
[2:23:11] this that he that's forgiven
[2:23:15] much loveth much
[2:23:18] amen that's why we love him
[2:23:22] I'm sorry I kind of bounced around a
[2:23:24] little bit this
[2:23:26] morning I thought should I preach all on
[2:23:28] Israel the sign Messianic sign should I
[2:23:32] talk about all of this and Greens Mill
[2:23:34] and angels and Seven Seals in the
[2:23:38] opening should I talk about the
[2:23:40] revealing of the son of
[2:23:42] man because the revealing of the son of
[2:23:45] man wow that's what it's all about
[2:23:50] even brother brandham on one tape he
[2:23:52] says one time this is no longer the
[2:23:54] voice of William
[2:23:56] brandham I'm using his
[2:24:01] Voice Hallelujah if I have ever been
[2:24:04] used behind this Pulpit or if there's
[2:24:07] ever been a minister in any days of his
[2:24:10] ministry that has ever been used of God
[2:24:13] it was because he got himself out of the
[2:24:16] [Music]
[2:24:18] way and he yielded to
[2:24:21] him and then he became God's
[2:24:26] voice amen that's why the Bible says no
[2:24:29] man takes this honor unto himself after
[2:24:32] the order of
[2:24:34] MDC
[2:24:37] amen so this morning I thank all of
[2:24:42] you for bearing with me this morning as
[2:24:45] I just kind of went from here and
[2:24:48] there gave a portion of my testimony and
[2:24:51] a
[2:24:53] dream all I want to do Saints is be I
[2:24:56] want to be

[2:25:02] Rapture Rapture or bust

[2:25:08] Diego State University underwater
[2:25:12] archaeology specializing in the field of
[2:25:14] marine biology I took a Latin because of
[2:25:17] most everything in science and in
[2:25:19] medical termin terminology is in
[2:25:25] Latin little did I
[2:25:28] know I would never get my
[2:25:31] degree little did I

[2:25:36] would throw it all away if I could use
[2:25:39] that term that I might find

[2:25:46] this

[2:26:04] yeah Jesus said if you love
[2:26:07] me if you love me keep my Commandments
[2:26:12] amen but it's not the keeping of The
[2:26:15] Commandments because he
[2:26:17] who is guilty of the least is guilty of
[2:26:21] all Jesus said I don't come to destroy
[2:26:24] the law but to fulfill it I tell you
[2:26:27] that Moses said a man shall not commit
[2:26:30] adultery but I tell you if a man even
[2:26:33] looks at a
[2:26:34] woman oh
[2:26:36] God you didn't come to destroy it you
[2:26:39] came to fulfill it to magnify
[2:26:44] it Thou shalt
[2:26:46] not
[2:26:48] murder there shall not be a false
[2:26:52] witness
