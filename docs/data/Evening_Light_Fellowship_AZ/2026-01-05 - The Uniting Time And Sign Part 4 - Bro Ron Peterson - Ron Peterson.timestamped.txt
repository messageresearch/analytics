[16:26] Sister [snorts] Debel is still in the
[16:28] hospital battling an infection and she's
[16:31] longing for fellowship and would love
[16:32] some visitors. Contact Sister Linda Lao
[16:35] for more information. So, let's remember
[16:37] Sister Debbie. The Lord would touch her
[16:38] and do a miracle for her feet and just
[16:41] touch her in a mighty way. Uh we want to
[16:43] remember Sister Linda Green. She's at
[16:45] home not feeling well. Remember her
[16:47] today uh that the Lord would touch her.
[16:49] So, I guess she's got a cough. We had
[16:51] two requests turned in for her. [snorts]

[17:09] patience, and a quick healing. So, we

[17:13] mighty way. I want to remember brotherh
[17:16] James Love as he's ministering in New

[17:20] him and just be with him during the

[17:23] I remember brother David Rufflitch. He's
[17:24] in the hospital. We think he had a mild
[17:27] stroke, we've been told, and broke his
[17:30] collar bone. So, let's remember him. The
[17:31] [music] Lord would touch him as well.
[17:34] Amen. Jill and I would like uh your
[17:36] prayers this week. A couple of months
[17:38] ago, uh she had a mammogram done. They
[17:42] found a lump was discovered. Biopsy came
[17:44] back showing a noninvasive form of
[17:46] cancer called DCIS.
[17:49] Jo will have a Friday to go in Friday to
[17:51] have it removed and follow up with
[17:53] radiation if needed. We would all
[17:55] appreciate your help and your prayers
[17:57] and uh during this week. So God's got
[17:59] everything in control. We're thankful
[18:01] for his hand upon our lives today. And
[18:03] he's a good God. Can you say amen?
[18:05] &gt;&gt; Do you have a need today?

[18:09] hands.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; Let's lift our hands. Sing unto him one
[18:12] more time. If you got a need today,
[18:16] give it to the miracle worker. He's a
[18:19] good God. Today, we want to continue to
[18:20] remember Sister Sharon Johnson. The Lord
[18:23] will touch her through her cancer
[18:24] treatment. It's good to have Sister
[18:26] Nancy here. [music] We're just asking
[18:27] the Lord to continue to touch her in a

[44:17] the house of the Lord today. I'm casting
[44:19] all my cares on you because he cares for
[44:22] you and I this morning. casting all my
[44:24] cares on him this morning. So I'm
[44:27] casting all my cares [music] on

[46:41] I believe that with all my heart.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. Thank you
[46:46] musicians. God bless you. Certainly is a
[46:49] grand privilege to be in the house of
[46:51] the Lord once again.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. To share with you the word of God
[46:56] and to just enjoy God's presence
[46:58] together. This is the first Sunday of
[47:02] the new year. And I think that's a good
[47:04] way to start the year, not only on our
[47:07] watch night service. In fact, uh those
[47:09] of you that missed our watch night
[47:11] service, we had a really tremendous
[47:13] time. Um, and uh, certainly always
[47:18] appreciate when you feel the presence of
[47:20] God, when he comes by in such a special
[47:23] way. He doesn't have to,
[47:26] &gt;&gt; but he did,
[47:28] &gt;&gt; and we're always thankful. Amen. Um,
[47:33] enjoyed the song specials this morning.
[47:37] He certainly is the not only the God
[47:41] on the mountain, but he's the God in the
[47:43] valley.
[47:45] And that song becomes a reality when
[47:47] you've gone through some valleys
[47:50] &gt;&gt; and
[47:52] you go through something and you don't
[47:54] feel his presence
[47:56] and he feels distant
[48:01] and you feel isolated
[48:05] but he says I will be with you
[48:08] &gt;&gt; even in you until the end of the world.
[48:12] And so uh we just take uh victory in
[48:17] that. You can be seated for just a
[48:19] moment. For just a moment, brother
[48:22] Mario, I would like you to come up here.
[48:24] My brother, he is going to be taking a
[48:27] missionary trip here. I believe on the
[48:30] 7th. And I'd like our minister brethren,
[48:33] brother Freddy, uh brother Steven, the
[48:35] different ones that are here uh at this
[48:39] church. and we're going to pray over him
[48:41] because he's going to be going uh on a
[48:44] missions trip. And I want you to just
[48:47] say where you're going, what you're
[48:48] going to be doing, and uh so that we can
[48:51] remember to pray for you because you're
[48:54] being sent out. And what a blessing
[48:57] because wherever you go, we go with you
[48:59] because our our blessings go with you.
[49:02] Brother Mario, God bless you. would you
[49:04] please tell us uh a little bit about
[49:06] what you're going to be doing on a
[49:08] missionary trip and when you're going
[49:09] and when you're coming back?
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. So, greet you all
[49:12] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[49:15] [clears throat] As I turn 67 last
[49:18] December 28th,
[49:20] uh God put it in my heart that uh if I
[49:24] spend the remaining years of my life
[49:27] serving the Lord maybe in the mission
[49:29] field.
[49:31] So, and we know it's not our desire to
[49:34] go by ourselves. We just need to be in
[49:38] the spirit of the Lord. So, it's my
[49:40] burden to go uh in the Philippines this
[49:44] coming year. So, I'll be going uh
[49:47] different places uh
[49:50] and uh the second week of uh January
[49:54] will be in Japan for their anniversary
[49:58] meeting maybe 5 days. and then going
[50:01] back to the Philippines. Then I'll be
[50:04] traveling to the southern part of uh the
[50:07] Philippines which is uh mostly on the
[50:09] Muslim side of uh the country. So I
[50:14] don't know how many days but as the Lord
[50:17] leads. So this is the first time I'd be
[50:20] visiting there cuz uh when I and brother
[50:22] Ron were in the Philippines
[50:25] uh there's a lot of uh ministers
[50:29] uh went there and attended the meetings
[50:32] and they are inviting brother Ron uh to
[50:35] come back and minister. So brother Ron
[50:37] always tell just tell brother Mario I
[50:40] will say [laughter] so so I have no
[50:44] choice but but as the Lord leads so
[50:47] we're happy to serve the Lord and maybe
[50:49] help elevate the faith of some of the
[50:52] brothers there in the Philippines. Thank
[50:54] you very much for all your prayers and
[50:56] thank you very much.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Well, you just stay right here,
[50:59] brethren. Come. Let's lay our hands on
[51:02] him. We know that it's never easy as you
[51:05] go. We're not [clears throat] going just
[51:07] to put another stamp in the passport.
[51:10] You're not going somewhere just to eat
[51:11] their food or to experience another
[51:14] country, but you're actually go ye into
[51:17] all the world and preach the gospel.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; And that's a desire upon every heart.
[51:22] And God then starts dealing with your
[51:25] heart
[51:26] &gt;&gt; in a certain direction and you're
[51:29] already feeling that.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; And then as the invitations come in,
[51:34] then what we want to do is be faithful
[51:36] to stand behind you, help support you
[51:39] and and go. And so you give our love and
[51:42] greetings to all of those uh where you
[51:45] go and preach hell hot and heaven cool.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Bring them into the presence of God.
[51:51] Amen.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Let them know that they are chosen of
[51:54] God, but they must make their calling
[51:57] and election sure.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're going to lay our hands
[52:02] and you guys just pray with us. Heavenly
[52:04] Father, as we lay our hands upon our
[52:06] brother, even as they in the Old
[52:09] Testament when one was departing from
[52:11] their midst to go into a mission field,
[52:13] we know, Father, it's never easy to go
[52:16] because uh traveling is hard. uh
[52:20] sleeping in other places in other beds
[52:23] outside of our own comfort zone is never
[52:26] easy. But I pray father let
[52:29] &gt;&gt; the gift that you have placed within his
[52:31] life be used for the glory of your
[52:34] kingdom furthering father this gospel of
[52:37] the end time wherever he goes. We ask
[52:40] that you will bless his ministry. Bless
[52:42] those that hear it father. May he take
[52:45] them into a higher dimension, Father,
[52:47] which is only by faith of the Holy
[52:50] Spirit. So, Father, we lay our hands on
[52:53] him. We send him forth and ask that you
[52:56] will watch over him, Sister Josephine,
[52:58] and wherever they go. Keep them, Father,
[53:01] in the center of thy will. And keep them
[53:04] safe, I pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[53:09] brother. Amen. Amen. Thank you, brother.
[53:12] Thank you. Thank you.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:21] Praise the Lord. All right, then let's
[53:23] get right into the service. Um,
[53:29] let's all stand together and let's turn.
[53:32] I'm going to continue on with this
[53:34] thought
[53:36] because even if those of you who were
[53:39] with us on watch night, I I just read
[53:43] our scriptures basically and just kind
[53:45] of got into it and all of a sudden the
[53:48] the Holy Spirit just comes down, takes
[53:50] you in a certain direction and and uh we
[53:53] thank God for that. But uh we're
[53:57] uh just going to have a a personal time
[54:03] with our church this morning and speak
[54:05] to you as a pastor. I've had some
[54:07] questions that have come up been asked
[54:09] to me and they were asked to me several
[54:11] weeks ago. And I said, "Well, I don't
[54:13] have time to maybe get into those, but I
[54:17] said you pray about it." And uh I I felt
[54:20] uh because it will help us launch off
[54:22] into our next service. Um so the Lord
[54:26] willing because I've been really very
[54:29] much um delving into the understanding
[54:34] of what is our placing as a bride in
[54:39] this hour. I want to know what is our
[54:42] responsibilities, what is our duties
[54:45] because we cannot activate promises of
[54:48] another age and claim it to be ours. But
[54:51] we must claim the promises that are made
[54:55] for the bride for this hour. That is our
[54:59] inheritance. And once you know your
[55:01] position, God then gives you power and
[55:04] authority.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; So that's our desire. So, um, may the
[55:09] Lord bless you as we kind of take a
[55:13] little bit, answer some questions, and
[55:15] again, be patient with me this morning
[55:18] so that understanding that we may be
[55:21] laying a little bit of a foundation for
[55:23] [snorts] the next service or two. So,
[55:25] God bless you uh, all this morning as we
[55:28] read in the book of Ephesians, chapter
[55:30] 4, Ephesians 4,
[55:33] verses 1-6.
[55:37] And I am thankful for lost and found
[55:41] because these were lost and I found them
[55:44] 10 years ago. They've been on my desk in
[55:47] the back room and now I use them. Uh now
[55:49] I need them and so I use them. So
[55:51] whoever lost them, you can't claim them
[55:53] now. They're mine. So
[55:57] I don't know about that toothbrush yet
[55:58] there. Somebody
[56:00] I do not claim somebody else's
[56:02] toothbrush. I'm sorry. But anyway, I I
[56:06] brother Robert really a toothbrush.
[56:10] Anyway, the Lord bless you.
[56:15] [snorts] Ephesians 4:es
[56:18] 1-6.
[56:21] [snorts]
[56:22] I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord,
[56:25] beseech you that you walk worthy
[56:29] of the vocation
[56:32] wherewith you are called, and with all
[56:35] loneliness
[56:38] and meekness, and with long suffering,
[56:40] forbearing one another in love,
[56:45] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[56:47] spirit in the bond of peace.
[56:50] There is one body and one spirit. Even
[56:53] as you are called in one hope of your
[56:56] calling, one Lord,
[56:59] one faith, one baptism,
[57:03] &gt;&gt; one God and Father of all, who is above
[57:07] all and through all and in you all.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But unto every one of us is given
[57:15] a given grace according to the measure
[57:19] of the gift of Christ.
[57:23] Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up
[57:25] on high, he led captivity captive and
[57:30] gave gifts unto men. Now that he
[57:33] ascended,
[57:35] what is it? But that he also descended
[57:39] first into the lower parts of the earth.
[57:42] And he that descended is the same also
[57:44] that ascended far above all heavens that
[57:48] he might fill all things. And he gave
[57:52] some apostles
[57:54] and some prophets and some evangelists
[57:57] and some pastors and teachers
[58:02] for the perfecting of the saints, for
[58:04] the work of the ministry, and for the
[58:07] edifying of the body of Christ.
[58:10] till we all come in the unity of the
[58:14] faith. So all of this that God is
[58:17] purposing and putting into the church
[58:21] has an end result. This is where God
[58:24] wants to lead you
[58:27] &gt;&gt; until we all come to the unity of the
[58:31] faith
[58:33] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[58:37] unto a perfect man,
[58:40] &gt;&gt; unto the measure, the stature
[58:43] of the fullness of Christ,
[58:46] &gt;&gt; that you hence swore be no more
[58:48] children, tossed to and fro, and carried
[58:51] about with every wind of doctrine, by
[58:53] the slight of men, and cunning
[58:55] craftiness, whereby
[58:58] they lie in weight to deceive, but
[59:01] speaking the truth in love, may grow up
[59:05] into him in all things, which is the
[59:09] head,
[59:10] even Christ,
[59:13] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[59:15] together, compacted by that which every
[59:18] joint supplieth according to the
[59:21] effectual working in the measure of
[59:23] every part, making increase of the body
[59:26] unto the edifying
[59:29] of itself in love. Please note verse
[59:33] three. Once again, Ephesians 4:3,
[59:40] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[59:43] spirit in the bond of peace. May God
[59:47] bless the reading of his word. You all
[59:49] may be seated this morning in the
[59:51] presence of the Lord. And I would like
[59:54] you to now just turn with me to the book
[59:57] of Revelation, chapter 2.
[1:00:01] Revel, excuse me, Revelation 22.
[1:00:04] Revelations 22.
[1:00:09] And
[1:00:12] let us look of a prophetic word
[1:00:16] of what God is doing in this hour.
[1:00:21] I'm interested not only for what God has
[1:00:24] done historically. Yes, it's good to
[1:00:26] look back into the Old Testament to into
[1:00:30] the New Testament to see the things that
[1:00:32] God did because if you look and you see
[1:00:36] the things that God did and how he did
[1:00:39] them, you'll begin to see a pattern. And
[1:00:42] brother Brennham says, I begin to see
[1:00:44] that pattern develop all the way from
[1:00:47] Genesis to Revelation. And he said if
[1:00:50] you understand that formula or the
[1:00:53] pattern he says then you'll know that
[1:00:56] God is the same yesterday, today and
[1:00:59] forever. He changes not.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; The only thing he changes is his mask.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; You know some say well put the prophet
[1:01:07] of God back in the pulpit. May I tell
[1:01:10] you the prophet has never lo left the
[1:01:13] pulpit. That's
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Understand? Because the the brother
[1:01:17] Brennham said really the prophet of
[1:01:20] every hour is the Holy Spirit.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that it's not a single
[1:01:26] man? It's not a single ministry,
[1:01:30] but it is now gone from a oneman
[1:01:35] ministry through prophetic
[1:01:38] uh oversight as an angel messenger to
[1:01:41] this age. Now, there's where brother
[1:01:44] says God through that one voice is
[1:01:48] ordained to take you back to the faith
[1:01:52] of your Pentecostal fathers.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now that messenger, that
[1:01:58] is his purpose to to transition you
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; to take you from here to another place."
[1:02:06] What I said the other day and I I very
[1:02:09] much meant it is that we are changing
[1:02:14] dimensions.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that we are
[1:02:18] already in the process that
[1:02:20] transformation
[1:02:22] is taking place
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; and one day it will transform us into
[1:02:29] another dimension. But right now little
[1:02:32] by little
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; we're being transformed.
[1:02:36] We're being lifted up.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; We're being given revelation. And that
[1:02:41] revelation is what is transforming you.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet of God said, "Faith
[1:02:48] is the the power of transformation."
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; So, understand that. But I I want to um
[1:02:58] and I I don't want to get ahead of
[1:02:59] myself for perhaps the next Sunday or or
[1:03:02] so, but I want you to get out of your
[1:03:05] onedimensional
[1:03:07] thinking.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; And I want you to realize that God is
[1:03:11] multi-dimensional.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; He is the same yesterday. That's one
[1:03:17] dimension.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; The same today, another dimension, and
[1:03:22] in the future.
[1:03:25] all different dimensions. And yet he's
[1:03:27] God.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't dwell just in time
[1:03:32] because he's a he's a God of eternity.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Time means nothing to God.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; And and so uh I I want to if I could say
[1:03:45] quicken your mortal minds out of carnal
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; and educational thinking. Amen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; And start thinking on spiritual levels.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; The only way that you can get into
[1:04:01] spiritual things is to seek him.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; If you don't seek him if you don't ask,
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; you won't get.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham said, "You must ask him
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; with your own mouth." Even on those on
[1:04:20] the road to Emmas,
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. They compelled him, "Stay here
[1:04:25] with us."
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, if there's ever a time
[1:04:29] when the church must say, "Stay here
[1:04:32] with us.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; I'M ASKING YOU. I'M COMPELLING YOU. I'M
[1:04:37] NOT GOING TO let you go. THE DAY IS FAR
[1:04:39] SPENT." HOW MANY OF YOU REALIZE,
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; HUH? By spiritual revelation, this day
[1:04:45] is far spent.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; I FEEL WE'RE OVERDUE.
[1:04:51] We're we're in the days of the
[1:04:53] longsuffering
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; of God. And I say, "Come quickly, Lord
[1:04:59] Jesus."
[1:05:00] This uniting that is taking place
[1:05:05] is uh been quickened to me here uh just
[1:05:11] recently to a another level
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; and I feel very much compelled to share
[1:05:19] that with you.
[1:05:22] And so I I I pray that you will pray for
[1:05:27] your pastor
[1:05:29] Okay? That God will take us and use us.
[1:05:32] He said, "You pastors, get into this
[1:05:34] word. Begin to eat it yourself. I must
[1:05:38] be a partaker myself.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; I must get into it myself first because
[1:05:45] how can I lead you into shady green
[1:05:48] pastures unless I know where I'm going?"
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Okay? to bring to you spiritual food in
[1:05:57] due season.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; And uh so in Revelation chapter 22
[1:06:04] here um and I I let you be seated, but
[1:06:08] we're standing in our spirit because uh
[1:06:11] we're honoring God when we read his word
[1:06:14] in Revelation 22:17-21.
[1:06:20] And the spirit, notice that is capital
[1:06:23] S. That means God's spirit, not human
[1:06:27] spirit, but God's spirit. The spirit and
[1:06:32] the bride say come.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; So whatever the spirit is actually
[1:06:38] quickening, the bride is saying the same
[1:06:42] thing.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Come and let him that heareth. So the
[1:06:49] spirit is speaking
[1:06:53] through the bride
[1:06:56] and to him that heareth because now both
[1:06:59] are saying the same thing. Come.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Now that is not a suggestion.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; THAT IS A COMMANDMENT. COME.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:10] WHEN you ask your children, IF YOUR
[1:07:14] CHILD WAS OUT HERE playing on the street
[1:07:17] and cars were going by
[1:07:20] and you saw that they were in danger,
[1:07:25] there would be there would be something
[1:07:27] in your voice from your mothers or your
[1:07:30] fathers
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; that should quicken to THAT SON WHO'S
[1:07:33] OUT there not realizing he's in danger.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU WOULD SAY, "COME, COME NOW.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; THERE WOULD BE AN URGENCY.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; There would be it would be a command
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; that
[1:07:48] must be obeyed.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Are are we together?
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; SO THIS EMPHATIC COME
[1:07:56] IS NOT JUST a suggestion
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; but it's a compelling
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; a command.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Come
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; and let him
[1:08:10] that is a thirst.
[1:08:12] So he that hearth and he that's thirsty
[1:08:15] let him come and whosoever will let him
[1:08:20] take of water of life freely. Now just
[1:08:23] for a moment because brother Brandham
[1:08:27] was walking with brother Floyd Patterson
[1:08:29] one time hunting in Colorado. This is
[1:08:33] personal testimony.
[1:08:35] And he says, of course, walking with the
[1:08:38] prophet of God, he said, uh, you know,
[1:08:42] uh, you listen very carefully because a
[1:08:45] prophet is always expounding on the
[1:08:48] word, okay? Whether he's hunting or
[1:08:51] whatever. Now, just letting you know
[1:08:54] that when they went hunting, all of the
[1:08:57] brethren that were invited to go with
[1:09:00] brother Brennham were were instructed
[1:09:04] very carefully, "Brother Brennham is out
[1:09:06] here, just rest and relax, have a good
[1:09:09] time."
[1:09:11] And he said, "He always drops into
[1:09:15] spiritual channels, but we don't want
[1:09:17] you to ask him questions." He said, "Is
[1:09:21] that clear to every one of those
[1:09:23] invited?"
[1:09:25] Because they said, "Let him because they
[1:09:29] said that he would sit around the the
[1:09:31] fireplace." And one time he stood up.
[1:09:33] There was brother Roy Borders and
[1:09:35] brother Floyd and a couple two or three
[1:09:37] other men. This wasn't a large group.
[1:09:41] And said the prophet of God began to
[1:09:43] just kind of say a little bit about his
[1:09:46] life and about the angel of the Lord.
[1:09:48] And all of a sudden, he stands up. All
[1:09:50] it is is there's a a campfire. And
[1:09:53] around this campfire, the prophet of God
[1:09:57] said, "He's here now."
[1:10:00] And he starts walking. He said, "Brother
[1:10:03] Floyd described, he said he started
[1:10:05] walking as a drunk man."
[1:10:07] He said, "His eyes rolled back."
[1:10:10] He said, "He's here."
[1:10:14] And when he did, there was such a
[1:10:16] presence of God
[1:10:19] and and and they're watching him
[1:10:21] intently because they know that when he
[1:10:25] said he's here and whenever he comes,
[1:10:28] something very special
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; happens. That means even in church,
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; yes.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. in your prayer class,
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; in a song special, in a dream.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; When he comes, there's something
[1:10:43] special.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "He's here now." And they're
[1:10:47] intently listening.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; And they said that he stood, his eyes
[1:10:52] roll back, and he turns to them quickly,
[1:10:56] "Ask what you will."
[1:11:00] And he, brother Floyd said, brother Ron,
[1:11:03] the the presence of God was so strong.
[1:11:07] He said, "What do I ask?
[1:11:11] I could have asked anything."
[1:11:13] He said, "I now this is what brother
[1:11:16] Floyd told me personally. He said, if I
[1:11:19] had another day to relive a moment in my
[1:11:24] life,
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; he said, I would love to go back to that
[1:11:27] day because I would ask
[1:11:30] because
[1:11:32] you have to ask it shall be given.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; And so they they told the the brethren
[1:11:40] when you go hunting there just don't ask
[1:11:45] questions. Let him
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; said because he'll drop into a channel.
[1:11:51] So, Brother Floyd is is going he and
[1:11:56] brother Brandham are leaving the camp
[1:11:59] site that morning to go out and go
[1:12:02] hunting. He said uh
[1:12:05] he said, "Brother Floyd, I know you have
[1:12:07] an awful lot on your heart." He actually
[1:12:10] gave Brother Floyd a nickname. He called
[1:12:12] him Brother Pat. Brother Random loved to
[1:12:14] get nicknames. So, he said, "Brother
[1:12:17] Pat," he said, "I know there's a lot on
[1:12:19] your heart." He said, "I want you I want
[1:12:22] you to go up this direction." He said,
[1:12:25] "I'm See that?" He said, "See that large
[1:12:28] tree up there on the hill? It'll take us
[1:12:31] about 45 minutes to hike to get up
[1:12:34] there." He said, "I'll meet you at that
[1:12:36] tree and by the time I reach it, I'll
[1:12:39] have a word for you." Imagine that. My
[1:12:43] goodness.
[1:12:45] So they go up there and they get there
[1:12:50] and to the best of my recollection of
[1:12:54] this being told
[1:12:57] they're walking and he says, "Brother
[1:13:00] Floyd, Brother Pat,"
[1:13:03] he says, "the Bible says, "Let whosoever
[1:13:05] will." But it's not.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Imagine that. The The Bible says, we
[1:13:12] just read it. Let whosoever will, he
[1:13:15] said, but it's not. He says, because no
[1:13:18] man can come
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; except the father draws him first.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; So here it would look like he he he's
[1:13:31] actually contradicting the Bible. He's
[1:13:33] not.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; He's intensifying it.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; He's bringing it to a greater
[1:13:38] understanding. LET WHOSOEVER WILL COME
[1:13:42] So this is is an invite for whosoever
[1:13:47] will that has an ear that's thirsting
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; AS THE SPIRIT IS speaking
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; let them come.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Okay. [snorts]
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; So then
[1:14:06] verse 18. For I testify unto every man
[1:14:09] that heareth the words of the prophecy
[1:14:11] of this book.
[1:14:14] If any man shall add unto these things,
[1:14:17] God shall add unto him the plagues that
[1:14:19] are written in this book. This is a
[1:14:22] warning.
[1:14:23] And if any man shall take away from the
[1:14:25] words of the book of this prophecy,
[1:14:28] God shall take away his part out of the
[1:14:31] book of life and out of the holy city,
[1:14:35] and from the things which are written in
[1:14:38] this book,
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; which he he which testifith, saith the
[1:14:45] these things, surely I come quickly,
[1:14:48] even Amen. Even so, come Lord Jesus. The
[1:14:52] grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
[1:14:55] you all. Amen. Now, I would like to
[1:15:00] title my sermon this morning,
[1:15:04] and I don't know how far I will get, but
[1:15:07] I wish to just um expound on a few
[1:15:11] things, but not to belabor them.
[1:15:16] So uh again I bear
[1:15:20] uh your
[1:15:22] patience, your understanding for my
[1:15:25] having to go into this because as a
[1:15:29] pastor you must address certain issues.
[1:15:34] Pastoring a church in the 21st century
[1:15:37] is one of the hardest
[1:15:40] things that one can do. It's not just
[1:15:43] preaching. That's the easiest part of
[1:15:46] pastoring.
[1:15:47] Okay. I remember John Dubsky and
[1:15:50] different ones that have worked very
[1:15:51] closely with me for years and sat into
[1:15:54] the times of counsel. He said, "Brother
[1:15:56] Ron, you couldn't make me want to be a
[1:16:00] pastor with all the money in the world."
[1:16:02] He said, you know, and different ones.
[1:16:05] And you have to understand it. It it
[1:16:07] takes a man called of God. Otherwise,
[1:16:09] you'll be you'll be crushed under the
[1:16:11] pressure. That's right.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Because there's pressures that come
[1:16:14] because you've got to you've got to
[1:16:16] correct. You've got to say things.
[1:16:18] You've got to Brother Brennham said,
[1:16:19] "Every every good cowboy." Now, I was
[1:16:22] raised around horses
[1:16:25] and different things. And he said,
[1:16:26] "Every good cowboy makes sure what his
[1:16:30] horse is eating from."
[1:16:32] He said he doesn't let his or horse eat
[1:16:36] loco weed because if he eats loco weed
[1:16:39] you won't be able to ride him.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; 21st century parable.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Some of you may be chewing on some loco
[1:16:52] weed
[1:16:54] that you haven't. So, I I need to say,
[1:16:56] "Hey, hey, hey." And and you know,
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; it's hard to get something that that
[1:17:01] horse has been chewing on. Hey, spit
[1:17:03] that out. It's not like a dog, hey, let
[1:17:05] go. Drop that ball. A horse, he looks at
[1:17:08] you and keeps chewing.
[1:17:11] So, you [snorts] just don't reach up in
[1:17:13] a horse's mouth and grab it out and
[1:17:14] everything because he just keeps
[1:17:16] chewing. So, anyway, I am entitling my
[1:17:21] sermon
[1:17:22] the uniting time and
[1:17:27] But now as a pastor, I'm taking this
[1:17:30] subject and this will lead off into
[1:17:33] something here for the near future.
[1:17:36] Endeavoring
[1:17:40] to keep the unity of the spirit.
[1:17:44] I'm endeavoring to do that
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; because in this day and hour there are
[1:17:53] so many spirits and there are so many
[1:17:55] voices in the land. Brother Brennham
[1:17:58] said many times what it'll do it will
[1:18:01] come and try to bring division among us.
[1:18:05] The apostle Paul says, "Mark them which
[1:18:07] cause division you'll bring to you uh
[1:18:10] endless genealogies and questions that
[1:18:13] gender strife."
[1:18:16] Theological questions that really, you
[1:18:18] know, uh did Adam have a navl?
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Who cares?
[1:18:26] I You know, to me, he's the first one.
[1:18:29] He didn't come through the womb. So, did
[1:18:32] he have a navl? Well, it really bears no
[1:18:35] significance to any of us. It's
[1:18:38] interesting. I might say, "Well,
[1:18:39] probably not." But, uh, I don't know. He
[1:18:43] might have came from the very womb of
[1:18:45] God and therefore because he was birthed
[1:18:48] in.
[1:18:50] Do you see what I'm saying? I I DON'T
[1:18:52] KNOW. It doesn't really matter.
[1:18:55] that has no bearance on you as a
[1:18:59] Christian doctrally of where you're
[1:19:02] going and what you believe. Who cares?
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; So, there are some theological questions
[1:19:07] that can't be answered that really all
[1:19:10] they do is gender strife.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; And I think sometimes different ones
[1:19:14] love to get off into these areas and and
[1:19:17] stuff. And if brother Brennham, let me
[1:19:20] just clarify this that if brother
[1:19:22] Brennham doesn't say it,
[1:19:25] We don't have to go out here and try to
[1:19:27] experiment and try to clarify something.
[1:19:29] If he didn't do it, stay on solid
[1:19:32] ground.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Is the earth flat or round?
[1:19:38] Some have said, "Well, this flat
[1:19:41] because the Bible says four corners."
[1:19:44] Ah, and on and on and on. Nonsense.
[1:19:49] Stop it.
[1:19:52] Christopher Columbus
[1:19:55] was told that he's going to come the
[1:19:57] world. He's going to sail and he's going
[1:19:59] to drop right off. And he says, "Well,
[1:20:02] I've seen in my telescope." Now, watch
[1:20:04] the simplicity.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "I've watched a ship as it
[1:20:09] sails to sea and it goes out and I watch
[1:20:12] and the big high mass and the big
[1:20:14] billowing sails as it goes off into the
[1:20:18] horizon." And he said it totally sinks
[1:20:21] down and down and I realize it's going
[1:20:25] over something
[1:20:27] and it disappearing. Is it falling off
[1:20:30] the edge of the world or is it showing
[1:20:33] simplicity that the earth is round? When
[1:20:37] you fly up into space and turn around
[1:20:40] and take a picture of the earth, is it
[1:20:41] flat?
[1:20:43] Ah, you see. Anyway, I I don't know why
[1:20:46] I'm getting off onto that. I'm just
[1:20:48] saying those things gender strife. It
[1:20:50] doesn't really matter. You can't preach
[1:20:53] it for doctrine. Now, if you want to
[1:20:55] with your church, go ahead, brother.
[1:20:57] Yeah, you can tell them it's flat all
[1:20:59] you want and everything like that. But
[1:21:01] to me, I say no. I, you know, I'm going
[1:21:04] to stay with what the prophet of God
[1:21:06] said. Now,
[1:21:09] um,
[1:21:11] we know that there are seasons. Now
[1:21:13] follow along with me right now in your
[1:21:16] spiritual mind that there are times and
[1:21:19] seasons for everything under heaven.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; A time to be born, a time to die, a time
[1:21:26] to sew, and a time to reap. Do you
[1:21:29] understand? So there's a time for
[1:21:30] everything. So there's times and seasons
[1:21:34] that we have seen from Genesis chapter 1
[1:21:38] all the way through to the end of the
[1:21:40] book of Revelation.
[1:21:43] We know that there are times and
[1:21:45] seasons. Now, brother Brennham says in
[1:21:48] every time God will give that time a
[1:21:53] sign.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; He never leaves an age or a time. But
[1:21:59] what he gives a voice or a sign to that
[1:22:03] age.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Now, not everyone will accept the sign.
[1:22:08] They may see it. They may even read it
[1:22:11] or hear it, but they won't understand
[1:22:13] it.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; What good is to see a sign and might say
[1:22:17] Phoenix 20 miles. If you don't know how
[1:22:18] to read, it's just a sign.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; But a sign is a declaration.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; So, we have seen the sign
[1:22:29] of a of a prophetic ministry.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; And you've all been privy to this.
[1:22:38] This has not been done in a corner.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; This is something that uh has taken
[1:22:44] place and all of us are able to look
[1:22:48] into it. Now whether or not you can look
[1:22:51] beyond the sign is up to whether or not
[1:22:55] you're elected to go beyond.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; You've got to be predestinated.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:06] So, we know that there are times and
[1:23:10] seasons in God's word that it must
[1:23:12] become manifest.
[1:23:14] That's what is bearing upon my heart. I
[1:23:18] want to know what is my season. Where
[1:23:21] are we at chronologically?
[1:23:23] What are the promises that we can claim
[1:23:28] as the bride of this hour for our
[1:23:31] inheritance?
[1:23:33] Brother Bram said, "You can claim the
[1:23:35] promises. Uh, we're going to build an
[1:23:38] ark and we're going to float through the
[1:23:40] tribulation." He said, "You can you can
[1:23:44] try to bring those promises to pass."
[1:23:47] But he said, "God, that was not your
[1:23:50] season.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; That was Noah's season."
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? So, we have to come
[1:23:56] into the understanding of the time and
[1:23:59] the season we're in. Now, brother
[1:24:02] Brennham said there are five musts.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Five musts that every must fit that
[1:24:08] criteria. So, let's look at this for a
[1:24:11] moment. It must be according to God's
[1:24:14] time.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:24:20] It must be according to God's season.
[1:24:24] So, let me give you an example of that.
[1:24:26] We know we're in Laiusa. That is a time.
[1:24:29] That is an age. But there is a season
[1:24:34] within that time.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; We not only need to know the time,
[1:24:41] but the season
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; is it planting time or is it harvest
[1:24:45] time?
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; The season changes within the time.
[1:24:52] So it must be according to God's word
[1:24:55] because the prophet preaches a sermon
[1:24:58] called the absolute
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; and he says the word of God is our
[1:25:03] thumbum
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; and he says that is our measuring post
[1:25:08] and he said though an angel or another
[1:25:11] messenger come down and preach to you
[1:25:14] another gospel let him be accursed.
[1:25:17] Okay. So, it must be according to the
[1:25:21] word of God. That is a major. We don't
[1:25:26] uh we don't take that very lightly.
[1:25:29] Number four, there must be uh it must be
[1:25:32] the person whom God chose.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of times we see within the
[1:25:38] scriptures that man chooses one but God
[1:25:41] chose another.
[1:25:44] We see uh in the days of Samuel, God had
[1:25:49] sent Samuel as a prophet to lead the
[1:25:52] people. But they wanted a king.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; So the people chose a king, but God
[1:25:58] chose Samuel.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Now Samuel took it personally, didn't
[1:26:01] he? Well, they've rejected me. And God
[1:26:04] says, "Wake up, Samuel. They didn't
[1:26:06] reject you. They rejected me
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; because I'm the one who sent you. So
[1:26:09] they're not rejecting you. They're
[1:26:11] rejecting me.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying?
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And all of that will tie into maybe the
[1:26:17] question that I'll be answering even the
[1:26:21] this morning.
[1:26:23] So again, put on your spiritual thinking
[1:26:26] caps. Number five, it must be uh a true
[1:26:30] inspired revelation
[1:26:33] and vindicated of God by its manifesting
[1:26:37] itself in fruits.
[1:26:40] Now, how do you know what kind of a tree
[1:26:43] it is until you see the fruit?
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but there's all
[1:26:48] kinds of citrus trees.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; There's lemon trees,
[1:26:54] there's orange trees, there's all kinds
[1:26:57] of citrus, grapefruit.
[1:27:00] I don't know. Well, I'm not that good to
[1:27:02] be able to look and see, well, that's a
[1:27:04] grapefruit until I see grape fruit on
[1:27:08] the tree.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Or an orange. How do
[1:27:11] you know it's an orange?
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Got it's gotten Yeah.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; If it looks like a duck, swims like a
[1:27:19] duck, quacks like a duck,
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; there's a good chance it's a duck.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; SO, YOU UNDERSTAND? YEAH,
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; you all all are known by the fruits on
[1:27:31] your tree.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Are you a believer? Let me see.
[1:27:35] Believing fruit.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SAY YOU are a orange tree.
[1:27:41] Brother Brennham said, here's a quote.
[1:27:44] He says, you can vehemently say you're
[1:27:46] an orange tree. He says, but until you
[1:27:49] bear orange fruit,
[1:27:51] he says, then I doubt your testimony.
[1:27:56] He says, "I'm not judging you. I'm just
[1:27:58] a fruit inspector."
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; That's all we're doing. We're just
[1:28:03] inspecting your fruit.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Now, [clears throat]
[1:28:08] we know that the world is waiting for
[1:28:09] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:28:12] You cannot come into that position until
[1:28:15] you know the inspired
[1:28:19] inspiration or the revelation to be
[1:28:23] manifested for your hour
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; until it's brought to your attention
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; and then you claim it.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; First you see it, YOU SAY, "OH, WOW.
[1:28:36] HERE'S A promise for the bride. Here's a
[1:28:39] promise for the elect seed in this end
[1:28:42] time. Here's the end time seed sign.
[1:28:45] Here's the uniting time and sign here.
[1:28:48] And so, Brother Brennan, when he gives
[1:28:50] these sermon titles, they're
[1:28:52] declarations.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; They're not just uh uh something that he
[1:28:56] brought. Well, I'll just talk about the
[1:28:58] invisible union of the bride. And then
[1:29:01] he never does talk about it. I know
[1:29:03] there are ministers that love to give
[1:29:05] some kind of flowery, mysterious sermon
[1:29:07] and when you get done and they there was
[1:29:09] nothing that matched the sermon title uh
[1:29:13] with the their sermon they're preaching.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Well, [clears throat] I just think that
[1:29:18] the prophet of God was so simple.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that what he would do
[1:29:25] is he'll give a declaration
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; and then he expounds on it. If he's
[1:29:31] going to talk about filters,
[1:29:34] okay, where did he get the sermon about
[1:29:37] filters?
[1:29:39] Cigarette pack. Where in the world would
[1:29:41] you get a sermon from a cigarette pack?
[1:29:44] In fact, he's out walking along and the
[1:29:47] spirit of the Lord quickens to him and
[1:29:48] said, "Pick up that cigarette pack."
[1:29:50] Ain't going to pick up cigarette pack
[1:29:53] that was thrown off to the side. You
[1:29:55] know, probably smoked all of them and
[1:29:56] they threw them off to the side. Ain't
[1:29:59] no way. No, go back and pick it up. So
[1:30:01] he picks it up and he, you know,
[1:30:03] thinking man's filter.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham talks in that
[1:30:07] sermon about filters, natural and
[1:30:09] spiritual.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Now understand, he said, according to
[1:30:13] your taste,
[1:30:15] if you got a worldly man's taste, you
[1:30:18] will choose
[1:30:20] a church that will supply a worldly
[1:30:25] man's taste.
[1:30:27] it will satisfy.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; He said it won't. You won't find a
[1:30:32] pastor that's preaching against the
[1:30:33] things of the world. Why? Because that's
[1:30:36] not your filter.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brennham talks about natural
[1:30:40] filters, spiritual filters. And he says,
[1:30:43] "And the greatest filter that we can
[1:30:45] have today is the Holy Spirit."
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:30:53] understand this. Now let me just go into
[1:30:56] a natural so that you understand this
[1:30:58] direction.
[1:31:00] We talk about times and seasons.
[1:31:04] You know that winter is coming because
[1:31:07] you see the effects of its coming. You
[1:31:11] see the change in the weather. You see
[1:31:14] the change in the color of the trees.
[1:31:17] What does that indicate to you? Oh,
[1:31:20] we're entering into the fall of the
[1:31:22] year. where it is winter. It's coming
[1:31:26] now. Hey, I'll tell you what. Even this
[1:31:29] morning, you can you you know, compared
[1:31:31] to yesterday's morning, this morning's a
[1:31:33] LITTLE BIT NIPPY. WE REALLY DON'T have a
[1:31:35] winter here in Arizona. It gets cold a
[1:31:38] few times, but you know, different ones
[1:31:39] that come down from up north or they're
[1:31:41] from the way up there and everything
[1:31:43] come they come down and they'll spend
[1:31:45] January or so uh here and they'll take a
[1:31:47] walk in the desert and and maybe they'll
[1:31:50] go early morning or they'll go out and
[1:31:52] go camping in our desert thinking it
[1:31:54] don't get cold in Arizona and all of a
[1:31:57] sudden they're going man it's cold
[1:32:01] because
[1:32:03] you don't expect it to be cold
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; if you're up north where it's 20 below,
[1:32:08] you're going to dress accordingly and
[1:32:10] you kind of expect it down here. You a
[1:32:12] man, it's 70°. Take off your coat. You
[1:32:15] need a sleeping bag. I'll probably just
[1:32:17] dislay you. See what I'm saying?
[1:32:21] So,
[1:32:23] you notice the change in the temperature
[1:32:26] because winter is breathing down your
[1:32:29] neck. You You can tell you can feel its
[1:32:33] effects.
[1:32:35] Even here in Arizona, not as much as you
[1:32:37] would in perhaps Canada or up in the
[1:32:40] frozen north, but we feel it
[1:32:42] nevertheless.
[1:32:46] Here recently, we just went through
[1:32:47] Christmas and New Year. How did you know
[1:32:50] Christmas was coming? Because every time
[1:32:53] I went to the mall, guess what? Jingle
[1:32:56] bells, jingle bells, you better be
[1:32:58] naughty or nice cuz Santa's coming to
[1:33:01] town. You know, all this stuff. it.
[1:33:04] What? What was it? All of everything was
[1:33:07] letting go. The season, it's declaring,
[1:33:11] "Hey, December, Christmas,
[1:33:14] and everybody starts thinking about
[1:33:16] getting gifts." And I don't know about
[1:33:18] you, but I hate to go to the mall during
[1:33:21] November, December. It's just a mad
[1:33:24] rush. People spending money that they
[1:33:27] don't have
[1:33:30] debt. And they said the average American
[1:33:33] income family will go into debt for a
[1:33:37] period of nine months for what they
[1:33:39] spend to give their kids on Christmas.
[1:33:43] They'll go into debt. They won't be able
[1:33:44] to pay it off. So, man, they throw out
[1:33:47] the credit card there and and they spend
[1:33:50] money that they don't have.
[1:33:53] Listen, if if you're one of those that
[1:33:55] has a credit card and you don't think
[1:33:56] about it and you run that thing up,
[1:33:58] you're not a good steward, a good
[1:34:00] ambassador.
[1:34:03] I had a brother just recently, just two
[1:34:04] days ago. He said, "Uh, brother Ron, you
[1:34:08] know, my dearly beloved brother in
[1:34:10] Christ, I, you know, and big spiritual
[1:34:13] letter and everything like this." And,
[1:34:15] you know, I met you and over in
[1:34:16] Indonesia and we were at the ministers
[1:34:18] meeting and here's the photo of you and
[1:34:21] I together and on and and by the way, I
[1:34:24] uh I got myself into a terrible debt.
[1:34:27] Now, I need to pay the debt. I need you
[1:34:29] to give me the money that I can pay my
[1:34:32] debt. [clears throat]
[1:34:33] And uh so he he did the snapshot of his
[1:34:37] credit card and and and then he did the
[1:34:39] the you know the exchange of what it was
[1:34:42] in their money over to us and you know
[1:34:46] here it is right at $4,000.
[1:34:49] So my brother beloved brother in Christ
[1:34:51] please I compel you. Are you kidding me?
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Huh? I don't even listen.
[1:34:59] I don't do that with my kids.
[1:35:02] You if you spent the money, hey, if
[1:35:05] you're
[1:35:07] foolish enough to spend the money and
[1:35:09] you don't have it, then it's a good
[1:35:11] thing for you to
[1:35:14] work hard.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Dig yourself out of the hole. And I
[1:35:17] guarantee you, IF YOU SUFFER ENOUGH, you
[1:35:21] won't do it again.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; But if you don't suffer from it, if
[1:35:25] somebody bails you out, guess what? next
[1:35:27] week. Yeah. Throw that old card out
[1:35:28] there, man. Huh?
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:35:35] So,
[1:35:37] the signs for going from natural now to
[1:35:41] spiritual. Matthew 24 talks about the
[1:35:45] signs of the end time. Matthew 24 talks
[1:35:48] about a time of war
[1:35:51] and a time of earthquakes
[1:35:54] and the seas w the the roaring waves of
[1:36:00] the sea tsunamis on and on. Can we see
[1:36:03] those signs? It seems like every day
[1:36:06] another earthquake
[1:36:08] uh another tsunami
[1:36:11] another this different things happening.
[1:36:14] Brother Brennham said those things are
[1:36:16] given to you as signs. And brother
[1:36:18] Brennham says the earth is HAVING BIRTH
[1:36:21] PAINANS. HE actually preaches a whole
[1:36:24] sermon. He said if you'll notice those
[1:36:27] things in the natural, they're typing
[1:36:29] something in the spiritual.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; And he says THIS KINGDOM IS TRYING IS
[1:36:35] HAVING a a nervous breakdown. Mother
[1:36:38] Earth is is trembling. She's being RAPED
[1:36:42] AND PILLAGED OF ALL OF HER NATURAL
[1:36:45] SOURCES. ALL of her her lakes and rivers
[1:36:50] and air, everything is polluted.
[1:36:53] THE FORESTS are cut down. The mineral
[1:36:57] sources are just DEPLETED TO VAST
[1:37:02] DEGREES. We've made our our our air to
[1:37:06] where it's breathable. Let me tell you,
[1:37:09] if you think this place is nice now,
[1:37:12] wait till it's renovated,
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; huh?
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Boy, you talk about a remodel.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; If you if you think the mountains are
[1:37:20] green right now and the rivers are blue
[1:37:23] and the just wait till we get over
[1:37:26] there.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; You're going to go, "Oh, [laughter]
[1:37:30] this is amazing." So I'm saying that the
[1:37:34] signs that we see now let me just bring
[1:37:37] to you a sign before I launch off into
[1:37:40] into a question in questions and answers
[1:37:45] in Hebrews chapter 2 in 1957.
[1:37:49] Brother Brennham, I'm bringing this to
[1:37:51] your attention [snorts]
[1:37:53] now. When the end time comes,
[1:37:58] and we're getting down to the end, if I
[1:38:00] see it right,
[1:38:02] the gospel
[1:38:05] is there's supposed to be a great
[1:38:07] revival taking place.
[1:38:10] So, he's saying, I if I see it right,
[1:38:12] we're coming to the end and there's got
[1:38:15] to be a great revival.
[1:38:17] Now, did you know that the Jewish flag
[1:38:19] is the oldest flag in the world?
[1:38:23] Been uh laying dormant for 2,000 years,
[1:38:28] more than yay, about 2500 years. The
[1:38:31] Jewish flag, the sixpoint start of
[1:38:33] David, never flowed for 2500 years since
[1:38:38] the carrying away of Babylon. And now
[1:38:42] because of Roman Empire took them over
[1:38:45] and the Messiah come and they rejected
[1:38:47] it, they were scattered to the four
[1:38:50] winds of the earth. Now hold on to that
[1:38:52] for just a second. Don't don't keep
[1:38:54] reading. Follow me.
[1:38:57] He says, "Now they're scattered. The
[1:38:59] dispersa,
[1:39:02] they were scattered all over the world."
[1:39:04] Now Jews whenever they go into another
[1:39:07] country because they're businessminded.
[1:39:10] Hey, listen. You want to go into a
[1:39:12] country and find who's got a thriving
[1:39:15] business, find a Jew.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; They prosper.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Okay? And they don't intermar. They just
[1:39:24] they stay among themselves. And so when
[1:39:27] they go into uh an area, they they start
[1:39:31] companies, they start thriving, and they
[1:39:33] start doing well. Well, once once
[1:39:35] they're there and they're located and
[1:39:36] they've they've made their business
[1:39:39] there, they stay there.
[1:39:41] So, what's going to move them from there
[1:39:43] to get them back to their homeland?
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said Hitler, Stalin,
[1:39:50] and Mussolini, pre-tribulation spirits.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "We're driving
[1:39:56] elect."
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; And he said, "That was the tender,
[1:40:03] merciful hand of Jehovah."
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Now, to you and I, it don't look like
[1:40:08] that. Right.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Hey, taking the the Jews and killing
[1:40:11] them, making them wear a a yellow star
[1:40:15] and and taking them out of their homes
[1:40:16] and and crystal knocked and over there
[1:40:19] in Germany. And you you all know the
[1:40:21] story. And yet, brother Brennham said
[1:40:23] God had to do it
[1:40:26] to drive them back into their homeland
[1:40:29] because a Jew as Abraham out of his
[1:40:32] homeland is not an inheritor of the
[1:40:35] promises.
[1:40:37] And we as believers
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; are not inheriting of the promises UNTIL
[1:40:42] YOU'RE IN YOUR RIGHTFUL POSITION of the
[1:40:46] word of the hour FOR THIS DAY. BECAUSE
[1:40:48] IF YOU'RE OUT HERE DOING things that you
[1:40:50] shouldn't and you're living in areas
[1:40:53] that you shouldn't AND YOU'RE ON THE
[1:40:55] wrong land,
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A PROMISED LAND WE CALL THE
[1:41:02] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. IT'S OURS. IT'S
[1:41:06] TIME TO GO POSSESS IT.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Off your mountain,
[1:41:10] round and round. How many YEARS UNTIL
[1:41:12] YOU GET OFF YOUR MOUNTAIN?
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Go possess the land.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Okay, now watch. Let's go back to this
[1:41:19] quote. [snorts] Did you know on May the
[1:41:22] 6th, 1946,
[1:41:25] the flag that came back over Jerusalem
[1:41:29] again?
[1:41:31] Did you know on May the 7th, 1946,
[1:41:34] the angel of the Lord appeared to me the
[1:41:37] next day up here and sent me into the
[1:41:40] world to bring forth a revival.
[1:41:43] The very next morning
[1:41:45] when that flag raised in Jerusalem as
[1:41:49] the going down of the sun of that
[1:41:51] afternoon, the angel Lord appeared here
[1:41:53] in the United States.
[1:41:55] at the same time.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; When you see the fig tree and the rest
[1:42:00] of the trees putting forth.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; So now we see that in 1946 a fig tree is
[1:42:09] putting forth its buds. If you're
[1:42:12] spiritual, you'll see
[1:42:14] that when you see the fig tree Israel
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; coming back, he said you know that
[1:42:20] summer is nigh.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:42:25] So the very same hour,
[1:42:28] the very same day that he said God is
[1:42:30] dealing with Israel,
[1:42:32] HE SAYS GOD SENDS the angel to me with
[1:42:37] this message because you can't have the
[1:42:40] Jews come to their position until the
[1:42:43] Gentiles take theirs.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Because we have to finish what is called
[1:42:48] the Gentile dispensation.
[1:42:50] We're just a little grafted in
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; branch
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; at this time and until the days of the
[1:42:57] Gentiles be fulfilled.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; So we're in the times of the Gentiles.
[1:43:02] God blinded the Jews.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; And he did it purposely.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Why? He had to do that. So true Jews
[1:43:11] will never see the light of this message
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; because they're blinded to it. Because
[1:43:18] the only ones that are going to open
[1:43:20] their eyes, there's two witnesses
[1:43:23] according to the book of Revelation. Who
[1:43:26] are they? Moses and Elijah. They are the
[1:43:30] two witnesses. Now understand, okay,
[1:43:32] I'll I'll say this by Revelation.
[1:43:35] If you see on CNN or Fox News
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; two witnesses start calling signs down
[1:43:44] from heaven and doing all of this stuff.
[1:43:49] You done missed your day
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; and you're headed for tribulation.
[1:43:58] And you that never got the Holy Ghost,
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; okay, and never took your position,
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; you're going to be
[1:44:09] it'll it'll be a t. He told Billy Paul,
[1:44:11] he said, "Brother Billy, whatever you
[1:44:13] do, don't you miss it.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; You think you think you got pressure on
[1:44:18] you now?
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; You just wait."
[1:44:24] He said, "What's holding the judgment
[1:44:26] from the earth right now?" He said,
[1:44:27] "There's a thin red line."
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "That represents the blood.
[1:44:32] Take off of the bride. Off of the earth,
[1:44:36] the blood is removed.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; And now, guess what? Judgment.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Now, the bride, the only judgment she
[1:44:44] sees is here. It's right now. It's going
[1:44:46] on right now. That's why you're here."
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; You're not here to see how good you are.
[1:44:50] You're to see where you fall short.
[1:44:51] Right.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God, show me. If there's an area,
[1:44:54] hey, THAT'S WHAT WE DO. GOD, SHOW ME. I
[1:44:56] DON'T I DON'T WANT TO COME HERE looking
[1:44:58] down. I'M I'M GLAD I'M NOT LIKE HIM. I I
[1:45:01] don't want to have some Pharisee
[1:45:02] religion. Well, I tell you what, I'm
[1:45:04] better than him. I at least I'm here
[1:45:06] once in a while. Uh he don't come every
[1:45:09] six weeks.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Well, that's comparing ourselves among
[1:45:13] ourselves and we become foolish.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Don't choose, if you're going to really
[1:45:17] choose somebody, CHOOSE SOMEBODY THAT'S
[1:45:19] THERE ALL THE TIME. CHOOSE SOMEBODY
[1:45:21] THAT'S THAT'S BETTER THAN YOU.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; We have a tendency. Huh? Well, just like
[1:45:26] if you're going to learn a sport, I
[1:45:28] don't care if it's pickle ball or
[1:45:30] basketball or football, if you're going
[1:45:33] to get better, choose somebody that's
[1:45:36] much better than you.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Cuz they will inspire you.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; You pick a guy. Hey, do you know how to
[1:45:42] play pickle ball? No, I've never played
[1:45:44] it. Good. Come here. I'm going to beat
[1:45:45] you every
[1:45:48] See, get out of the kitchen. What do you
[1:45:50] mean the kitchen? I'm not in the
[1:45:52] kitchen.
[1:45:54] Just volley that thing.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? You're going
[1:46:00] to you're going to choose somebody
[1:46:01] that's better than you.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because you want to
[1:46:08] get closer to God.
[1:46:10] Choose friends
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; that you know their life
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; is close to God.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Don't choose somebody that the guy's
[1:46:20] struggling and having a hard time and I
[1:46:22] just can't and always and you know, oh
[1:46:24] hey, you know this and that and I don't
[1:46:26] think this and over here and all these
[1:46:29] questions and stuff. You're you're never
[1:46:31] going to grow. Get somebody that that
[1:46:33] that hey, how you doing today, man?
[1:46:36] Praise God. Yeah. Amen. I'm overcoming.
[1:46:38] I'm doing good. and and you know they're
[1:46:40] going through a trial.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; You're never gonna be without trials in
[1:46:44] this life.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; You're either going into a trial or
[1:46:49] coming out of one.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Okay? But trials are here
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; and they're going to get tougher.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; But that's okay. God's grace is get
[1:46:58] greater.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Okay? Now,
[1:47:02] so I saying all that. So [clears throat]
[1:47:04] bear with me for just a few moments. And
[1:47:08] I want to give a disclosure before I get
[1:47:10] into this uh this question that this is
[1:47:14] to my church and my church only. If you
[1:47:16] guys are visitors, God bless you. Just
[1:47:19] sit and listen or you know go get a
[1:47:21] drink or something while I answer these
[1:47:23] things. Uh because it's not to you. This
[1:47:26] is this is to my church. Even brother
[1:47:28] Brandham said, "Now those that are
[1:47:30] listening in the tape, these are my
[1:47:33] people that God's Do you understand?" So
[1:47:35] this disclosure, I'm saying, "Hey, I'm
[1:47:37] not trying to be the internet pastor and
[1:47:39] everybody follow me and every I'm going
[1:47:41] to see how Hey, if you like my YouTube,
[1:47:43] go ahead and subscribe. Hit right there.
[1:47:46] Give me the deal because if you support
[1:47:47] and I want to hear the bell ring and
[1:47:49] every time every Sunday you'll get the
[1:47:51] next sermon. Oh, nonsense.
[1:47:56] That is not my desire. I'm going to get
[1:47:58] into something some things here in a
[1:47:59] moment. So just bear with me. So giving
[1:48:03] a disclosure
[1:48:05] if you are from another church and
[1:48:07] listening to this service whether you
[1:48:08] are here physically or you are archiving
[1:48:11] or you are streaming
[1:48:13] [snorts] uh just let me speak to my my
[1:48:16] people here. Now first question
[1:48:20] the brother brought it up to me. He
[1:48:21] said, "Brother Robert, your song leader,
[1:48:25] mentioned over the pulpit
[1:48:28] to pray for a sister who is a faithful
[1:48:31] streamer to our assembly but does not
[1:48:34] attend our church in person." So he
[1:48:37] says, he says, "Brother Ron,
[1:48:40] he brother Robert says, "Oh, let's pray
[1:48:42] for sister who is a faithful streamer.
[1:48:45] She sends her tithes and everything."
[1:48:47] Well, they catch that. So here here was
[1:48:50] the question.
[1:48:52] What is the difference between staying
[1:48:55] home and streaming a service?
[1:48:58] Just the same as there are many message
[1:49:00] believers who are staying at home and
[1:49:02] pressing play.
[1:49:09] Legitimate question.
[1:49:12] Okay.
[1:49:14] So what is the difference?
[1:49:17] Okay. Okay. Now, first off, I want to
[1:49:19] say the reason we have streaming now,
[1:49:24] brother Stafford Massie asked me years
[1:49:27] ago. He said, "Brother Ron, do you want
[1:49:29] to be the first pastor that's on the
[1:49:32] internet with streaming?" I said,
[1:49:34] "What's that?" Oh, well, hey man, that's
[1:49:36] the latest thing. You're there's going
[1:49:38] to be all kinds of stuff and you can be
[1:49:40] the first one. I said, "I'm not
[1:49:41] interested." Yeah.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Anyway, so the reason that we stream our
[1:49:46] services is for the convenience of those
[1:49:50] who can't make it to service for
[1:49:52] whatever reason. They were sick, they're
[1:49:54] on vacation,
[1:49:56] etc., etc. We do have some that have
[1:49:59] medical reasons why they can't be in
[1:50:02] service and maybe they haven't been here
[1:50:04] in a year or two
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; and yet they faithfully stream the
[1:50:08] service because they consider this their
[1:50:10] home church. They pay their tithes and
[1:50:13] yet
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; that's true.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Is that true, brother Robert?
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; And then there are some, brother Robert,
[1:50:18] that send their tithing in. And you all
[1:50:21] know, listen to me now that I do not
[1:50:25] propagate my ministry and say, "Hey, all
[1:50:28] of you out there, uh, well, you that uh,
[1:50:31] listen to this, send me your tithes and
[1:50:33] this." No, I am not an internet
[1:50:36] preacher. I've got one I'm a husband of
[1:50:39] one wife. Amen.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennan, I'm going to give you
[1:50:45] the quote. Some of you, what are you
[1:50:46] talking about? Brother Brennham says,
[1:50:50] "The pastor, spiritually speaking, is
[1:50:53] the husband to the church." So, I'm not
[1:50:56] interested in having other wives in
[1:50:58] other countries and other places
[1:51:02] and them all supporting me. And I did
[1:51:04] have an elder within the message. I'm
[1:51:07] just sharing with you some of my
[1:51:08] experiences. He said, 'Why, brother Ron,
[1:51:11] you were over in Europe and you know so
[1:51:13] many churches and and and so many people
[1:51:15] over there and all these people and some
[1:51:17] of them you have birthed into Christ.
[1:51:19] You should start a little group in
[1:51:21] Germany over here, one in France and one
[1:51:24] in Belgium and one in Holland and and
[1:51:26] and ordained a minister there and put
[1:51:29] him as pastor and then have them all
[1:51:32] send you their tithing
[1:51:34] and then you can come back once every
[1:51:36] three, four months. Oh, God bless you.
[1:51:37] collect the ties and give them a little
[1:51:39] flowery sermon and and and go on. And
[1:51:42] then he said, "Brother Ron," he said,
[1:51:44] "then you can sit back in your old age
[1:51:46] and everybody just keeps sending you
[1:51:48] money.
[1:51:51] I'm the husband of one wife."
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; I am not. Now watch the internet has
[1:51:57] developed things called internet
[1:51:59] ministries.
[1:52:02] And some of them don't even have a home
[1:52:05] church. Some of them just do it by a
[1:52:07] podcast.
[1:52:09] Some of it do it and you know what they
[1:52:11] do? Hey, if you like, subscribe. Send us
[1:52:14] your like this. Okay. And so anyway, I'm
[1:52:18] just saying the times have changed here
[1:52:21] in the day and the hour in which we
[1:52:24] live. In in in fact, I told you this
[1:52:28] before,
[1:52:30] Brother Austin Johnson, you were with me
[1:52:32] the last time you and I got together and
[1:52:33] you said, "Brother Ron, I want to show
[1:52:35] you something." Uh, and you there with
[1:52:38] your cell phone, your cell phone didn't
[1:52:40] even have your computer. Okay. AI. I
[1:52:43] don't know who he spoke to, if it was
[1:52:45] Siri or somebody, but he spoke to his
[1:52:48] phone and he says, "I want you to design
[1:52:52] a sermon about God's love and I want you
[1:52:56] to use scriptures." Within seconds,
[1:53:00] bang, they come up here. Brother Ron,
[1:53:01] look at that. Oh, man. All these
[1:53:03] scriptures. Oh, wow. This is amazing.
[1:53:07] This is amazing. And he says, "Okay, now
[1:53:11] uh AI, I want you to take all of the
[1:53:14] quotes from the message of the hour of
[1:53:18] William Brham, and I want you to
[1:53:20] incorporate that into that sermon."
[1:53:24] Seconds later, he said, "Look at this,
[1:53:25] brother. Is this true?"
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going, "Austin, that's great. You
[1:53:30] need to you need to give me this hat,
[1:53:32] man. [laughter]
[1:53:34] My days of laboring over sermons
[1:53:40] What does the ABC mean?
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Always. It doesn't mean Appleuilt
[1:53:45] computer.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; You see, you do not. Brother Brennham
[1:53:51] says God doesn't use mechanical devices.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, we're going to go into
[1:53:56] something here and I want you to
[1:53:57] understand. We're just laying a little
[1:53:59] bit of a foundation.
[1:54:02] But it's amazing
[1:54:04] how that ministries even today are using
[1:54:09] artificial intelligence which comes from
[1:54:12] the tree of knowledge.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Now the other day because I went to uh
[1:54:19] [snorts] I went to Home Depot because I
[1:54:22] was looking for a little thing that goes
[1:54:24] to the end of the faucet
[1:54:27] and to a garden hose hooks up to it.
[1:54:30] It's called a uh valve pressure release
[1:54:34] thing. Okay. I I didn't know what it was
[1:54:36] and what its name was. The only thing is
[1:54:38] this one didn't work on my home. I took
[1:54:40] it off with a pair of pliers, took it to
[1:54:42] Home Depot, and the guy says, "Well, I
[1:54:44] really don't know. Hang on here just a
[1:54:46] second." He took his phone, took a
[1:54:49] picture.
[1:54:51] What is this? All of a sudden,
[1:54:54] AI found it. Oh, that is called a
[1:54:57] pressure relief valve. And that could be
[1:54:58] found in and here you can find one at
[1:55:01] Ace Hardware. You can go here to Lowe's
[1:55:03] and Don and such and such plumbing
[1:55:06] department has it and everything. Wow.
[1:55:12] I did it.
[1:55:14] I went ahead because the other So I went
[1:55:17] to uh Ace Hardware because it said they
[1:55:20] have them. So, I went in there and I
[1:55:22] said, uh, I says, "I want a water
[1:55:28] pressure relief valve that goes there.
[1:55:30] Then you hook your spot up, excuse to
[1:55:33] this faucet and your hose up to it." And
[1:55:37] the guy says, "Well, here, uh, let's go
[1:55:40] over here." And he shows me and he says,
[1:55:41] "And this was the wrong size." I said,
[1:55:44] "No, no, it's got to be not from 3/4 to
[1:55:47] 3/4. This has got to be from a 1 and16th
[1:55:51] to 3/4 reduction.
[1:55:53] Ah, no. I don't think I said hang on
[1:55:55] here just a second. [laughter]
[1:55:59] Here it is. Oh, yeah.
[1:56:04] Yeah, I have one. Aisle 20,
[1:56:08] top shelf. He went over there, picked it
[1:56:10] up. I said, "Thank you." Wonderful. I I
[1:56:14] we're we're in an age now where hey um
[1:56:18] here
[1:56:20] years ago, this is 10 or 12 years ago
[1:56:23] when brother Aaron McGary was here. Now
[1:56:25] he's so sharp on a computer. We were at
[1:56:28] Home Depot getting some parts and we
[1:56:31] happened to pick up a part that doesn't
[1:56:33] have a price on it. Have you ever done
[1:56:36] that?
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; No. out of the whole bin out of 30
[1:56:39] pieces. I picked one that doesn't have
[1:56:42] the the price or the code.
[1:56:45] So the guy says, "Uh, okay, hang on just
[1:56:48] a second. Um, we need a price check on
[1:56:51] aisle three over here bring like this."
[1:56:54] And so this guy's coming and Aaron says,
[1:56:56] "Hang on.
[1:56:59] Here it is. 13 cents."
[1:57:03] I said, "How did you do that?" He said,
[1:57:05] "It's simple." Well, listen, you can't
[1:57:08] teach an old dog new tricks,
[1:57:11] you know. I Hey, I am just I have just
[1:57:14] barely mastered cut and paste.
[1:57:18] Anything beyond that,
[1:57:22] my phone
[1:57:24] or my computer does something and it
[1:57:27] goes into cyberspace or it does
[1:57:30] something. When I get upgrades, it's the
[1:57:33] most frustrating thing in the world
[1:57:35] because I'm used to doing it a certain
[1:57:37] way. Now they get the upgrade and it
[1:57:39] moves the query box from the top to the
[1:57:42] bottom. Where
[1:57:45] where is this thing? Oh, it's down here.
[1:57:49] I'm just a creature of habit. So, I'm
[1:57:51] seeing all of this. Okay, now just bear
[1:57:53] with me. I told you. Okay.
[1:57:57] The reason that we stream and archive
[1:57:59] our services is for the convenience of
[1:58:01] our church and our church only.
[1:58:04] Now, there are some churches that
[1:58:06] require a password. If you want to get
[1:58:08] on there and find out what that pastor
[1:58:10] is preaching, you need to write in and
[1:58:12] if they give you an authority approval,
[1:58:14] they'll give you a password and then you
[1:58:16] can find out. Well, I'm not there
[1:58:18] almost, but I'm not there at that.
[1:58:22] Listen, [clears throat] if someone who
[1:58:25] streams our services are listening to an
[1:58:28] archive sermon and they like it, fine.
[1:58:31] That's wonderful. And many people say,
[1:58:33] "Brother Ron, oh, I enjoyed that
[1:58:34] service. That's great." And uh or if
[1:58:37] they don't like it, then uh hey, you
[1:58:40] know, you're off your rocker. You're
[1:58:43] this and that. And and listen, I get
[1:58:45] those all the time. Well, listen, I'm
[1:58:48] not your pastor.
[1:58:51] criticize someone else.
[1:58:55] I'm here for this group. Now, if it's my
[1:58:58] group, you send it to me. Okay, then
[1:59:00] we'll address it. So, um anyway, some
[1:59:04] critics take my services and even have
[1:59:07] taken
[1:59:08] what we've said and cut and splice it
[1:59:11] and put it onto their website and
[1:59:13] saying, "Brother Ron, did you notice,
[1:59:15] Brother Ron? Oh, where's the picture of
[1:59:19] the pillar of fire?
[1:59:22] Oh, where's the picture of Brother
[1:59:24] Brennham? I've never had him up, but
[1:59:27] they said I did. And I said, 'Well, they
[1:59:30] took him down. Oh, such nonsense. They
[1:59:34] use AI. Do you know how how AI can take
[1:59:38] a picture of you
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; and make you say something you didn't?
[1:59:42] Or uh you know, next thing you know,
[1:59:45] hey, I was never with brother Brandham,
[1:59:48] but I can take a picture of myself. And
[1:59:50] I say, now put me next to brother
[1:59:52] Brandham
[1:59:54] and I'll send you a Christmas card with
[1:59:56] me and Brother Brandham.
[2:00:00] I don't know how to do it, but it's
[2:00:01] being done. In fact, h did any of you
[2:00:05] guys get Christmas cards or quotes from
[2:00:09] brother Brandham about New Year's or
[2:00:11] about Christmas and it gives you this
[2:00:14] and got a flowery all this kind of stuff
[2:00:16] and it's a picture and it's been
[2:00:18] forwarded a 100,000 times
[2:00:22] and they send it to you. Do you take is
[2:00:24] that really a nice note from somebody
[2:00:26] when they forwarded just oh happy new
[2:00:29] year and merry Christmas? No, I would
[2:00:31] rather have a sentence from you. Hey,
[2:00:34] brother Ron, thinking of you. Have a
[2:00:36] happy new year, Brother John. Hey, good.
[2:00:40] Otherwise, delete. Gone.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Nothing personal.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now,
[2:00:58] so although they did the cutting and
[2:01:00] splicing with Brother Bram's sermons,
[2:01:03] even right here in Arizona, Brother Bram
[2:01:05] answers this on on uh on a tape. He
[2:01:08] says, "Why in Arizona, there's somebody
[2:01:10] there that's taking my messages and
[2:01:12] cutting them up and splicing them,
[2:01:14] making it say something I didn't say."
[2:01:18] And so even now within the message,
[2:01:20] different ones, whoever they are,
[2:01:23] they're they are the modern-day shimeies
[2:01:25] who are just trying to find criticism
[2:01:27] with God's anointed
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; and all they want to do is just create
[2:01:31] trouble and they're whatever. And I say,
[2:01:33] "Hey, you know what? God reward them for
[2:01:36] the chaos that they you understand that
[2:01:39] word reward."
[2:01:43] So anyway, God reward them for the chaos
[2:01:47] that they are bringing because now
[2:01:48] listen, I'm endeavoring to keep the
[2:01:51] unity of the spirit.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; I cannot keep the unity of the spirit
[2:01:56] unless I have the spirit.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; So I must work on the Holy Spirit to
[2:02:01] keep me humble,
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; not arrogant, not proud.
[2:02:06] One person asked the other day, and I'm
[2:02:10] getting ahead of myself, but that's
[2:02:11] okay. Okay. As they said, well, you know
[2:02:14] what's wrong with you pastors?
[2:02:17] You guys are not doing what Brother
[2:02:19] Renham said?
[2:02:21] You're proud. You're dictators. Once you
[2:02:24] get voted in, you why I tell you, then
[2:02:28] you just you're so proud and arrogant.
[2:02:30] You take all the tithing to yourself and
[2:02:32] this and that and you stand there and
[2:02:34] and everything. You're supposed to be
[2:02:35] voted in every year.
[2:02:41] Where do you get that? Show me the
[2:02:43] quote. [snorts] I want to ask you at
[2:02:46] Brandham Tabernacle, did they vote on
[2:02:47] Brother Brenham every year?
[2:02:51] No, they didn't. When did they start
[2:02:54] voting every year for a pastor at
[2:02:56] Brandham Tabernacle? Do you know?
[2:03:00] Well, most people don't. So don't sit
[2:03:02] there and assume something until you
[2:03:05] know.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; So brother Brennham's teaching is that
[2:03:09] once a pastor has voted in, and I'm
[2:03:12] going to show you some quotes because he
[2:03:13] talks about all this voting in and
[2:03:15] voting out. He said that don't mean
[2:03:16] nothing. He said Elijah was Jezebel's
[2:03:19] pastor whether she voted for him or not.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Capiche?
[2:03:27] You understand that? So, this voting in
[2:03:30] and voting out.
[2:03:32] Okay, again, I'm getting ahead of myself
[2:03:35] here. Um,
[2:03:40] well, I being that I'm into this, I
[2:03:42] might as well just go ahead and do it.
[2:03:44] So, I'm kind of leaving my notes and
[2:03:46] everything. But did you know that
[2:03:49] brother Brennham said all this voting in
[2:03:51] and voting out? He said in the
[2:03:54] scriptures, he said the first time
[2:03:56] spiritfilled men took a vote in the New
[2:03:59] Testament.
[2:04:02] Any of you, you read the book of Acts?
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, and Judas
[2:04:08] hung himself. And so now we need another
[2:04:10] to take his place.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; The first time spiritfilled men took a
[2:04:16] vote, they voted in the wrong guy.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; How many of you know that?
[2:04:22] Mias, he never did anything.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; GOD CHOSE [screaming] PAUL.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; If they would have waited,
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; they would have seen.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; Are you okay? Are are you understanding
[2:04:38] this is scripture?
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; So anyway,
[2:04:42] um so let's go into this. Um
[2:04:50] so sometimes
[2:04:53] questions come up because
[2:04:56] certain ones that you associate with
[2:04:58] will will create questions for you.
[2:05:01] That's okay. Happens with families and
[2:05:04] especially happening now among the
[2:05:06] message and that is you will rub
[2:05:08] shoulders with some people that do not
[2:05:11] go to church.
[2:05:14] They don't believe in going to church.
[2:05:16] They don't No, brother Brennham is their
[2:05:18] pastor. They just stay home and press
[2:05:20] play. I want to I just want to appeal to
[2:05:23] your understanding. Is this brother
[2:05:25] Brennham's doctrinal teaching?
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Then why are people fooled by it today?
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Well, there's several reasons.
[2:05:37] Number one, I don't want to be
[2:05:38] accountable
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; because going to church, you're
[2:05:42] accountable,
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:05:44] Hey, where were you last Sunday? Well,
[2:05:46] you know, we went to the ball game.
[2:05:51] I'm just hypotheticals.
[2:05:53] So, if you went to a ball game last
[2:05:55] Sunday, uh I'm not on your case. Nobody
[2:05:58] told me.
[2:06:03] But but but uh but understand
[2:06:06] we're living in an age of virtual
[2:06:08] reality
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; of you don't even have to go to work
[2:06:12] anymore. What do they call it? You you
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; you remote. Yo. Yeah. You don't even
[2:06:18] have to go to work anymore. You don't
[2:06:19] even have to dress up, put a tie on, go
[2:06:21] into a deal, punch a clock, you just go,
[2:06:23] "Hey, I'm working from home." And some
[2:06:26] men have I I've seen it. It's so cute
[2:06:30] where these guys they put on a shirt and
[2:06:32] perhaps a a a tie and their their coat,
[2:06:37] but they're still in their underwear or
[2:06:39] pajamas.
[2:06:41] They're sitting in front of their their
[2:06:43] camera. Hey, God bless you. Board
[2:06:46] meeting. It's so good to just be able to
[2:06:48] like that. And then their kids come in
[2:06:50] the back uh door and then you see him or
[2:06:53] the guy has to get up and go get
[2:06:55] something and he forgets and then
[2:06:57] everybody has a big chuckle because he's
[2:07:00] not even dressed for it.
[2:07:02] I I this brother that was asking me this
[2:07:06] question. It's kind of cute. And he
[2:07:07] said, "You know, Brother Ron," he says,
[2:07:10] "So what's the difference of staying
[2:07:12] home and streaming and uh those that
[2:07:15] just press play at home?" He says,
[2:07:17] 'Well, let me just tell you what I did
[2:07:19] with my with my my own family. I said,
[2:07:21] 'Well, please. So, he says, 'Well,
[2:07:23] Brother Ron, the first couple times we
[2:07:24] couldn't make it. We streamed your
[2:07:26] services. Guess what? We got all the
[2:07:27] kids up and out of bed. We got them
[2:07:29] dressed. We got dressed and we sat in
[2:07:31] the living room. And when you guys sang,
[2:07:32] we sang. When you stood up, we stood up.
[2:07:34] When you read your Bible, we read our
[2:07:36] Bible. He said that lasted a time or
[2:07:38] two. Then pretty soon, we're in bed in
[2:07:41] our pajamas. Don't even have to get the
[2:07:43] kids up and we stream.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; See how easy it is?
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; So, hey, there's a lot of times I I
[2:07:54] would like to just stream.
[2:07:59] Why fight the traffic?
[2:08:02] I'm tired.
[2:08:04] I've got all these excuses. Huh?
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? So
[2:08:12] those that stream,
[2:08:15] it's a convenience for you and and I do
[2:08:18] that. I I want you to use it when you
[2:08:21] can't be here. But nothing replaces
[2:08:24] being here
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; because when you're here, you're under a
[2:08:29] live ministry.
[2:08:31] The Bible says
[2:08:35] to obey those who have the rule
[2:08:39] over you. You ain't you ain't going to
[2:08:42] rule over me. You see what I'm saying?
[2:08:46] Whose faith follow
[2:08:48] considering the end of their
[2:08:50] conversation for Jesus Christ is the
[2:08:53] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:08:55] Brother Brandham's teaching, go to
[2:08:58] church on Sunday. Honor the
[2:09:01] resurrection.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "GO TO CHURCH. Choose
[2:09:06] somewhere."
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; But go to church. Have a pastor. Have a
[2:09:13] place that you pay your tithe.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; It's called your post of duty.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Now, any of you, anybody in here was
[2:09:21] ever in the military? Raise your hand.
[2:09:23] Military. Raymond. Who else? Okay.
[2:09:26] Brother Don Saunders. Well, after you
[2:09:29] joined the military and you decided
[2:09:30] after two weeks of boot camp, you
[2:09:32] decided you wanted to go to Bahamas uh
[2:09:35] to just get away because boot camp was a
[2:09:37] little too hard. Uh were you free to
[2:09:40] leave?
[2:09:41] Uh if you left, what would happen?
[2:09:46] Would they send somebody after you? Or
[2:09:48] if they don't know where you're at and
[2:09:50] you got caught, you went awall. Do you
[2:09:52] know what awall stands for?
[2:09:56] Absent without leave. Well, you're
[2:09:58] supposed to be I don't want to Fort
[2:10:00] Benning, Georgia.
[2:10:03] Nah, I want to be over in in Pearl
[2:10:06] Harbor, Hawaii. Man, that's that's that
[2:10:08] place I want to be cuz on the weekends,
[2:10:10] guess what? I want to go to the Sun and
[2:10:12] Sand. Do you see what I'm saying? All of
[2:10:14] you have a post of duty. You realize it.
[2:10:16] Post of duty. Now, that post of duty
[2:10:20] you've got to take extremely serious
[2:10:23] because God's got each one of you. Now,
[2:10:25] it may not be here.
[2:10:28] It may be somewhere else because guess
[2:10:30] what? I'm not the only pebble on the
[2:10:31] beach. I'm not the only pastor. Hey,
[2:10:34] there are other churches here in
[2:10:37] Arizona. There's other churches around.
[2:10:41] Find one
[2:10:43] that you feel is God ordained to take
[2:10:46] your and to watch over you.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Okay? To watch over you
[2:10:53] because God's going to make me
[2:10:56] responsible for what I tell you.
[2:11:00] You will not be responsible for me, but
[2:11:03] I will be responsible for you. And so
[2:11:06] there's been so many times
[2:11:09] that I know that I need to deal with
[2:11:11] something and I think, "Oh, Lord, I want
[2:11:12] to do that. I Oh, I'd rather go to the
[2:11:16] dentist.
[2:11:19] I [laughter] I don't want to have to say
[2:11:22] this." Okay? Now, understand this
[2:11:27] because I I may say some things in the
[2:11:29] future that's going to cause some people
[2:11:31] to be a little bit upset with me. Now,
[2:11:34] understand that the larger our church
[2:11:35] grows, many of you are what we call
[2:11:38] transplants.
[2:11:40] You weren't raised up under our
[2:11:41] ministry. I didn't birth you in Christ.
[2:11:45] I haven't always been your pastor.
[2:11:47] You've been transplanted for somewhere
[2:11:48] else.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Great. Praise the Lord. Welcome.
[2:11:52] Welcome.
[2:11:54] We're we're glad that you're here. But
[2:11:56] understand what I have taught to my
[2:11:59] people. Well, I now need to retach again
[2:12:01] because I got a lot of people that don't
[2:12:04] know. So then I go back over some of the
[2:12:07] ABCs.
[2:12:09] Right.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; I had a brother, a good friend of mine
[2:12:12] the other day. He I just happened to
[2:12:14] stream his service just, you know, it
[2:12:16] was an archive service and on there and
[2:12:18] and he was upset with his church and he
[2:12:20] said, "I tell you what, you guys are so
[2:12:23] bad and I I'm changing the name of my
[2:12:26] church to High Heel Tabernacle."
[2:12:34] I called him the other day and says,
[2:12:35] "Hey, man." Yeah. Did you hear that,
[2:12:38] brother? I'm so vexed. You know, I says,
[2:12:40] "Amen. I've been there. I know." I says,
[2:12:43] "What it is?" A lot of times they don't
[2:12:45] know. They don't know. Now, even if you
[2:12:49] do know, Brother Brennan had to
[2:12:51] repeatedly tell his own family. Now, if
[2:12:55] any of you have been here with me long
[2:12:57] enough,
[2:12:59] Brother Billy Paul gave me this
[2:13:00] testimony and he says, "Daddy called me
[2:13:04] one morning and said, "Billy, get the
[2:13:06] girls together. I've got thus sayaith
[2:13:08] the Lord for him. Wow.
[2:13:11] Get the girls together. Lois, Mida,
[2:13:15] Rebecca.
[2:13:17] Okay. Get all of the girls together
[2:13:20] because I've got thus sayith the Lord.
[2:13:22] And and Rebecca Smith, she says,
[2:13:25] "Brother Ron, when
[2:13:28] uh Bill called us and said, "Daddy's
[2:13:30] having a meeting just with family and
[2:13:32] get the girls together." We sat down
[2:13:34] there and oh man he said she said we
[2:13:36] were so and he says how many times has
[2:13:39] your daddy told you take off those high
[2:13:42] heel shoes
[2:13:45] and what you do you get a under a little
[2:13:47] conviction then you take and you get rid
[2:13:50] of them but a few months later he said
[2:13:52] you you go and buy another pair. He
[2:13:54] said, "Now I'm going to tell you for the
[2:13:56] last time.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Take off those high heeled shoes or the
[2:14:02] judgments of God be upon you. I've told
[2:14:05] you for the last time and I'm not going
[2:14:07] to tell you again."
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; Now Rebecca all of a sudden realized,
[2:14:13] "Wow, daddy is giving the ultimatum to
[2:14:16] me.
[2:14:18] It's up to you."
[2:14:21] Now, I realize that we've got a lot of
[2:14:23] different ones. You come from maybe
[2:14:25] where you come from, it's okay.
[2:14:28] Your skin down wiener skirts are allowed
[2:14:30] and and your cleavage is way down to
[2:14:32] here and you and your customs are that
[2:14:34] you do all kinds of different things and
[2:14:36] maybe your pastor allows it.
[2:14:41] Well, I'm a different kind of sort of
[2:14:45] guy.
[2:14:53] And I would rather retire
[2:14:56] than I would to compromise.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; I would. Now, here was the the the
[2:15:05] question. What about voting? Why don't
[2:15:07] you vote your pastor in every year? Show
[2:15:10] me where Brother Rem said it. Show me
[2:15:12] where he did it.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; It's not there. The only time they did
[2:15:16] it was after brother Brandham had
[2:15:19] stepped down and they got others up
[2:15:21] there because they wanted to make sure
[2:15:23] that it because brother Brandon was
[2:15:25] still the overseer until he died. Okay?
[2:15:29] And was a brother that got out of the
[2:15:32] way. In fact, I'll I'll tell you brother
[2:15:34] Brandham said your pastor is voted in
[2:15:37] even board members until
[2:15:40] what is until? until either they step
[2:15:42] down, resign, or they have an accusation
[2:15:45] against them and you vote them out. Did
[2:15:48] you know you can vote me out anytime?
[2:15:50] All it takes majority vote of the
[2:15:51] people.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; If something came up now, first off,
[2:15:56] it's got to be by the mouth of two or
[2:15:58] more witnesses,
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; right? And it's got to been put in
[2:16:01] writing.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Well, I saw Brother Ron drinking beer at
[2:16:04] a bar the other night. Well, for how did
[2:16:06] you know? Was you there?
[2:16:09] up.
[2:16:13] Yeah. With stammering lips.
[2:16:19] So, what I'm saying is it can't be just
[2:16:21] by one. No, brother so and so saw it and
[2:16:25] brother so and you put it in writing and
[2:16:27] then it's given to the board and the
[2:16:29] board takes it. Okay. And they then they
[2:16:33] because the Bible says the Bible says
[2:16:35] here's your absolute receive not an
[2:16:37] accusation against an elder except it be
[2:16:40] by what?
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; Two or three witnesses because you just
[2:16:45] can't do that. So now if you got the two
[2:16:47] or three witnesses now we got an issue
[2:16:49] we got to deal with it. Okay. So you can
[2:16:51] vote the pastor out at any time.
[2:16:53] Majority vote you can get rid of him. So
[2:16:56] you don't need to to say, "Well, you
[2:16:59] arrogant, proud pastors, you've got so
[2:17:02] much pride. You just once you're in, you
[2:17:04] are always in and nobody can."
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Wait a second.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Say what Brother Brennham said. Do what
[2:17:11] he did and quit throwing your quotes
[2:17:14] that you have got no foundation for.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[2:17:22] I hope that settles that one.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Let me show you brother Rem's teaching
[2:17:32] expectancy 1953.
[2:17:35] Brother Bodsworth, good evening friends.
[2:17:38] It's indeed a privilege to be back here
[2:17:40] tonight to minister to this audience.
[2:17:42] Tonight is a Sunday night when all the
[2:17:44] churches are having services of their
[2:17:47] own. It's Sunday night churches services
[2:17:50] of their own. We've asked all the people
[2:17:53] to have their own churches open to stay
[2:17:55] for their churches tonight. Stay for
[2:17:57] their churches rather than coming to the
[2:18:00] camp meeting so they can attend their
[2:18:01] own church. Here's his teaching.
[2:18:06] That's our business is to try to keep
[2:18:09] the people in their churches. And those
[2:18:12] who do not go to church, we're trying to
[2:18:15] get them to go to church.
[2:18:19] very grateful. We trust that you'll all
[2:18:22] affiliate somewhere with some good
[2:18:24] church of your choice and we'll make
[2:18:26] that your church home and remain a
[2:18:27] Christian as long as you live.
[2:18:31] 1964 questions answers. Brother Brenham,
[2:18:34] should we go to other churches even when
[2:18:36] they disagree with you?
[2:18:40] Sure. Yep. Jesus did when they disagreed
[2:18:43] with him. Go ahead and notice here.
[2:18:45] Should we go to another church that
[2:18:46] disagrees with you? Sure. I'm not the
[2:18:49] only pebble on the beach. You know,
[2:18:51] there's just other godly men everywhere.
[2:18:54] I hope I'm one of them. Now, do you see
[2:18:56] do you see Brother Bram's approach?
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; I am the only one. I am the Elijah. I am
[2:19:02] the Malachi 4. And I tell you what, if
[2:19:05] you go to any other church and you go
[2:19:07] anywhere else, spiritual adultery and
[2:19:09] all excommunicate.
[2:19:14] Look at his teachings. Most of all, look
[2:19:16] at his character.
[2:19:22] [snorts]
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; I was called in on something like this
[2:19:26] the other day. So now somebody's got a
[2:19:29] question. They called him in on it. Hey,
[2:19:30] we want to ask you. Okay. [snorts] A
[2:19:34] group in Arizona, Arizona's got all
[2:19:36] these problems.
[2:19:38] Called my attention to that. A
[2:19:40] ministerial group said the only thing we
[2:19:42] have against you, brother Brandham is
[2:19:44] one of the things the people said comes
[2:19:46] out here with you. You can't get them to
[2:19:48] go to church anywhere. This is 1964.
[2:19:52] We can't get them to go to church
[2:19:54] anywhere and they follow you. You can't
[2:19:56] get them to go to church. Well, he told
[2:19:59] them that they was welcome to come to
[2:20:01] our church. Now, I know they put
[2:20:03] pressure on you and they want you to
[2:20:05] join, but you don't have to join and you
[2:20:08] go to church. Don't set at home, go
[2:20:11] fishing and hunting and things like that
[2:20:14] on Sunday. We said, "Well, I'm not a
[2:20:15] legalist."
[2:20:17] Well, you better be in that manner for a
[2:20:19] while dishonoring the resurrection. You
[2:20:21] go to church somewhere.
[2:20:31] [snorts]
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; If I if I went to a certain church that
[2:20:33] I know, there's only one thing them
[2:20:35] people ever said that I believe. They
[2:20:36] said that they believe Jesus was the son
[2:20:39] of God. They said it. I doubt it, but
[2:20:42] I'd go to hear them say that.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; That's this church. Maybe the next
[2:20:48] church would be something like the
[2:20:49] Baptist. Yeah, I believe you have to
[2:20:51] have an experience going on. Brother
[2:20:53] Brandham, um, continuing on uh again,
[2:20:57] questions answers. Paragraph 213. this
[2:21:00] minister out there, this fellow down
[2:21:03] there that wanted to discuss it, that
[2:21:05] poor brother, he's in such a delusion.
[2:21:09] [snorts] He said, "Well, brother
[2:21:11] Brennham," he said, "he's against you
[2:21:12] Assemblies of God. And if an assembly of
[2:21:15] minister happens to pick up this tape, I
[2:21:17] want to tell them uh when was I ever
[2:21:20] against the Assembly of God men or any
[2:21:22] other men?" Why is that? when
[2:21:25] headquarters when your own headquarters
[2:21:28] admit, "I've sent over three quarters of
[2:21:30] a million of my children that I've
[2:21:33] begotten to Christ.
[2:21:36] Whoa.
[2:21:41] How I'm against the assemblies of God?
[2:21:44] Why am I against the oneness? I'm not
[2:21:47] against no oneness assembly, church of
[2:21:49] God, or no man. I'm against every system
[2:21:52] that separates
[2:21:54] man.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; What's a nickeladian spirit?
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; What's it do? What are the fruits of a
[2:21:59] nickelian spirit? It divides and
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; destroys unity.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Because somebody doesn't see it exactly.
[2:22:09] [screaming]
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. I'm so far past all of
[2:22:14] these arguings and disagreements and
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; white cloud or white horse. Let's just
[2:22:20] agree he's coming.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; I'm endeavoring to keep
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; the bond of peace by the spirit capital
[2:22:29] S.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; God get let me have the right spirit.
[2:22:32] Don't let me be some arrogant proud
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; Somebody told somebody here in my church
[2:22:38] the other day, Brother Ron's a very
[2:22:40] proud pastor.
[2:22:44] Well, I'm proud of you guys. I am guilty
[2:22:47] of that.
[2:22:52] But about myself.
[2:22:56] Are you kidding?
[2:22:59] I don't even think I'm really gifted. I
[2:23:02] don't think I have I'm not the brightest
[2:23:06] on the billboard.
[2:23:08] I'm not an eloquent speaker.
[2:23:12] I'm just I never asked God to make me a
[2:23:14] pastor.
[2:23:21] I do not think above myself, above
[2:23:26] measure.
[2:23:28] I pray that I do not give to you the
[2:23:33] illusion that I'm the only one
[2:23:37] that I'm the only pastor here in
[2:23:39] Phoenix. And you know, brother Ram said,
[2:23:42] I'm the pastor whether it's 1,200 mile
[2:23:44] radius and all. Oh, stop your quotes.
[2:23:49] Listen, there's churches within miles of
[2:23:52] us. Praise God. God, bring more
[2:23:56] churches that believe this message
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; cuz when they do, we're getting out of
[2:24:00] here.
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; That's all I say. God bless every other
[2:24:04] message minister
[2:24:09] with your blessings, Lord. But most of
[2:24:13] all, let us as the ministry give an
[2:24:17] example that you will follow instead of
[2:24:20] us getting so arrogant saying we're the
[2:24:22] only ones and it's us four and no more
[2:24:24] and we become beaver preachers.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; It's just us. It's our little group.
[2:24:31] Next thing you know, you can't have
[2:24:33] anybody who disagrees with you or sees
[2:24:36] it differently. Now, I'm going to I'm
[2:24:38] going to say this so that you'll
[2:24:40] understand. This year, I'm going to
[2:24:42] bring other ministers that you've never
[2:24:44] heard preach behind this pulpit.
[2:24:48] There are no names.
[2:24:50] They might only have 30 people in their
[2:24:52] church,
[2:24:55] but some of them are powerful.
[2:24:59] And you may say, "Well, Brother Ron, I
[2:25:01] ain't never heard of them." Well, that's
[2:25:02] good. Because sometimes God uses a no
[2:25:06] name,
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; huh?
[2:25:09] Yeah. Amen. Anyway,
[2:25:22] paragraph 214. Look, I've sent to the
[2:25:24] assemblies by their own count
[2:25:26] threequarters of a million of my own
[2:25:27] children. If they're so bad, why' I do
[2:25:30] that? Why I think it's the best there is
[2:25:33] in the land to send them to? Either the
[2:25:35] one some of the Pentecostal belief
[2:25:38] because they believe in divine healing.
[2:25:39] They believe in the supernatural. They
[2:25:41] believe in the baptism of Holy Ghost. I
[2:25:43] can't bring them all right here. They're
[2:25:46] all over the world. I got friends all
[2:25:48] over the world, children. I've begotten
[2:25:49] to Christ.
[2:25:52] And I get them up there and I get them
[2:25:54] saved. And I said, "Now you GO TO SOME
[2:25:57] GOOD FULL GOSPEL church and get you a a
[2:26:01] church home." How many ever heard me say
[2:26:04] that? Sure. Sure. Why would I send them
[2:26:07] there then?
[2:26:08] be a hypocrite to send my own children
[2:26:11] to death.
[2:26:13] Far be it from me. If you can't come
[2:26:15] here to the tabernacle, get to some
[2:26:16] church somewhere, go to it. [snorts]
[2:26:19] Trying to do God a service 1965.
[2:26:23] If I don't believe in going to church,
[2:26:25] why do I have churches?
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Why did he have Brandom Tabernacle?
[2:26:35] Why did he tell people to come to
[2:26:37] church?
[2:26:39] if he didn't believe in going to
[2:26:40] churches. Now listen, my own personal
[2:26:42] testimony was when we came into the
[2:26:45] message, there were no we didn't come
[2:26:48] through a message minister,
[2:26:51] okay? We we just somebody found some
[2:26:55] tapes and you know the the story and we
[2:26:57] started listening to tapes and we didn't
[2:26:59] even know Brother Brenham's name. We
[2:27:02] thought his name was Jeff from Indiana
[2:27:06] because on the the cartridge on the side
[2:27:08] of the tape said Jeff Indiana,
[2:27:12] short for Jeffersonville.
[2:27:15] But what we heard on those tapes
[2:27:18] told us to come out from among them.
[2:27:22] Be separate, saith God,
[2:27:26] and touch not every unclean thing.
[2:27:29] My no man speak like this man. So all of
[2:27:32] a sudden, hey, bunch of surfers and and
[2:27:35] druggies and hippies and everything.
[2:27:40] We We didn't know what to do, where to
[2:27:42] go. So we start listening to tapes.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; Every time we hear a tape, why you
[2:27:50] long-haired Ricky?
[2:27:53] Why you perverted men that got long
[2:27:55] hair? Why? You're wearing the women's
[2:27:58] clothes and the women's wearing the
[2:28:00] men's clothes.
[2:28:02] Whoa.
[2:28:05] I'm sitting there in a pair of shorts.
[2:28:08] He says, "Okay, you might as well call
[2:28:10] that guy wearing a pair of shorts in the
[2:28:11] big society."
[2:28:17] You see what I'm saying? And you
[2:28:19] longhaired?
[2:28:21] [snorts] What do you mean? For the first
[2:28:24] time, I hated getting a haircut my whole
[2:28:27] life. My dad, a redneck cowboy, you
[2:28:31] long-haired pervert hippie.
[2:28:36] So, my dad get haircuts. Oh, I hated it.
[2:28:39] I hated getting haircut. I love it. Now
[2:28:41] I fall asleep. They have to They have to
[2:28:44] wake me up. I wish I had a whole head of
[2:28:46] hair that it took them 45 minutes to do
[2:28:49] my hair BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR. I PAY THE
[2:28:52] SAME price
[2:28:54] as Robert McGary.
[2:29:00] It should at least be half price. I only
[2:29:02] got half a head.
[2:29:06] See, I ain't trying to be funny. It's
[2:29:09] just it's rude.
[2:29:12] So
[2:29:16] when we heard these tapes of brother
[2:29:18] Brennham
[2:29:21] nobody was telling us
[2:29:24] all of a sudden the conviction come on
[2:29:26] man. Ah for the first time in my life I
[2:29:29] can I'm out from my dad's headship and I
[2:29:33] can grow my hair long. And I told my
[2:29:36] father I'm going to grow my hair so long
[2:29:38] I'll walk on it before I cut it. And I
[2:29:40] meant it. I was rebellious.
[2:29:45] And then along comes this message.
[2:29:49] And the next thing you know, I I hear
[2:29:52] this these long hair and long hair on a
[2:29:56] man. It's a shame to him.
[2:30:01] Well, I guess I'm ashamed. Okay. I'm
[2:30:04] ashamed. Still keep here long, but I'm
[2:30:07] ashamed.
[2:30:11] One day, it's just a few weeks after I'd
[2:30:13] gotten converted
[2:30:16] and I walked by the mirror, I had long
[2:30:18] hair, had it to my shoulders, and I had
[2:30:22] beads around my neck.
[2:30:25] And I looked into the mirror and I got
[2:30:27] convicted.
[2:30:29] Nobody told me. We didn't have a
[2:30:31] minister. We didn't have, "Hey, I tell
[2:30:33] you what, long hair, you boys, I'll tell
[2:30:35] you what. You need to go cut your hair.
[2:30:37] I'm not here to throw these standards
[2:30:40] out there. Let the Holy Spirit come.
[2:30:43] He'll tell you what is long, what is
[2:30:45] short, what to do. GET THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:30:48] LET GOD BE YOUR LEADER. I JUST PUT YOU
[2:30:51] BACK IN REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT HE SAID.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; And I looked in the mirror and I said,
[2:30:57] "Whoa."
[2:30:58] And I'll show you a picture maybe
[2:31:00] someday. I got a picture of Sandy and I
[2:31:04] I drove all the way to Arizona to come
[2:31:07] see my girlfriend. Just brought her to
[2:31:08] the message. Here I am. My hair is still
[2:31:13] pretty long. Longer than the Beatles
[2:31:15] when they had their first Yeah. Any of
[2:31:18] you seen the some of the pictures of the
[2:31:19] Beatles when they first started out?
[2:31:23] Just over the years, man. That was long
[2:31:27] hair. Well, my hair after I cut it was,
[2:31:30] you know, and I thought I'd really done
[2:31:33] God a service. Ah, man. God, I have
[2:31:37] given you my hair.
[2:31:44] Well, I go to the first meeting after I
[2:31:47] cut my hair. We're listening to a tape.
[2:31:50] I got there late
[2:31:53] like some people do.
[2:31:56] I got there late. I come in and we're
[2:31:58] listening to the tape and I went by and
[2:32:00] I shook everybody's hand and I'm shaking
[2:32:02] her hand.
[2:32:09] Nobody said nothing. Nobody shook my
[2:32:11] hand. Well, God bless you. I went over
[2:32:14] there and you know what I did? I I went
[2:32:15] and turned off the tape. Hey, isn't
[2:32:18] anybody going to congratulate me for
[2:32:20] cutting my hair? They all looked at me.
[2:32:24] No, we expected that. Now shut up and
[2:32:26] sit down and put on the put the tape
[2:32:28] back on.
[2:32:30] I thought, "Wow."
[2:32:33] See, a lot of times you want somebody's
[2:32:36] recognition for what you've done. You
[2:32:39] see my long skirt. I expect it.
[2:32:43] Nobody said, "Hey, praise God. You quit
[2:32:45] wearing that skin down wiener looking
[2:32:47] thing and you got a long skirt." Listen,
[2:32:50] I'm going to ask you, sisters, sisters,
[2:32:52] I'm appealing to your common sense.
[2:32:55] The closer you get to God,
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; the greater your holiness.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; The greater your holiness will be to
[2:33:11] God.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; Because you know what? Without holiness,
[2:33:18] no man shall see God. That's right.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; It's not that we sit here and we talk to
[2:33:22] you young boys and we tell you you long
[2:33:24] hair. No. Let me tell you, if there's
[2:33:26] any of you that I feel has long hair,
[2:33:30] I'll be the first one to say I'm not
[2:33:32] going to tell you to cut it.
[2:33:35] I want him to do
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; because if I force you, you'll resent
[2:33:41] me.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, cut my hair.
[2:33:46] you do will never come back to your
[2:33:48] church again. All you want is some kind
[2:33:51] of a standard.
[2:33:54] See what I'm saying?
[2:33:57] Rebellion is as the sin of
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; witchcraft.
[2:34:02] So I'm not here. You know what? I have a
[2:34:05] heart for those that are struggling.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; I do.
[2:34:10] I have a heart for him. I say God,
[2:34:13] somebody says, "Brother Ron, somebody
[2:34:15] came and they this and that and
[2:34:16] everything."
[2:34:18] I said, "Let's ask, let's pray that God
[2:34:21] convict them
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; because if we make them our disciples,
[2:34:27] guess what? Somebody else will come
[2:34:28] right along and if they've got a more
[2:34:30] powerful ministry, they will make them
[2:34:32] their disciples and they'll change their
[2:34:34] opinion."
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; The Okay, boy. I am off of my subject
[2:34:40] here and it is 12.
[2:34:44] Brother Ron.
[2:34:46] [snorts]
[2:34:54] So what are the several main differences
[2:34:57] between streaming a service and pressing
[2:35:00] play? Is there a difference? Vast
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; difference. I'll explain a little bit of
[2:35:07] this right now. They do not believe in
[2:35:10] five-fold ministry.
[2:35:13] They believe Brother Brandham is the
[2:35:15] final voice.
[2:35:17] And he is the only voice that you hear.
[2:35:19] And if you press play, that is the
[2:35:22] token.
[2:35:30] So in other words, if you stay home and
[2:35:32] you just press play, that's the evidence
[2:35:34] you have the token and you're deceived.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; Because it's not by pressing a button.
[2:35:41] In fact, God does not ordain
[2:35:45] mechanical devices. Have you heard that
[2:35:47] quote?
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; You won't hear them say that.
[2:35:53] God never ordained mechanical devices
[2:35:57] to preach the gospel. He called, God
[2:35:59] called, God ordained, God equipped men
[2:36:02] to take this message. And there's a
[2:36:04] difference between those that stay home
[2:36:06] and stream the service because they have
[2:36:08] a home church, they have a pastor, they
[2:36:10] couldn't make it versus those who don't
[2:36:13] want to have a home church, that don't
[2:36:14] want to have a pastor, don't want to
[2:36:16] have an accountability, they don't want
[2:36:18] anybody to rule over them. They can stay
[2:36:20] home and they can do what they want. And
[2:36:22] if they want to listen to part of the
[2:36:24] service, fine. And if they want to go to
[2:36:25] sleep, they can go to sleep during the
[2:36:27] service and wake up and say, "I got it."
[2:36:32] Such deception of the ant. I'm sorry.
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to try to make everybody
[2:36:40] see it exactly like me, but we're having
[2:36:43] spirits. Spirits write on words.
[2:36:53] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[2:36:56] Okay. Yeah.
[2:37:00] My last quote. Musicians, have you come?
[2:37:04] I'm getting hungry.
[2:37:06] [snorts]
[2:37:10] Not really. I just said that. I
[2:37:13] shouldn't lie from the pulpit here.
[2:37:15] Brother Ron, don't do that.
[2:37:20] Christ the mystery of God revealed. Now
[2:37:22] you got tapes on that.
[2:37:25] You got tapes on what we believe.
[2:37:30] You got tapes on discipline in the
[2:37:31] church.
[2:37:33] How we behave ourselves in the church of
[2:37:35] God. How we got to come here together to
[2:37:38] sit together in heavenly places. Don't
[2:37:43] stay home.
[2:37:46] If God's in your heart, you can't hardly
[2:37:48] wait
[2:37:49] for them doors to open out yonder to get
[2:37:52] in there to fellowship with your
[2:37:53] brothers. If you don't feel that way,
[2:37:55] then I tell you, it's time you got to
[2:37:57] praying.
[2:37:59] Cuz we're in the last days
[2:38:02] where the Bible exalted or exhorted us
[2:38:04] to much more as we see that day
[2:38:06] approaching to love one another with
[2:38:08] Christian love and divine love to
[2:38:10] assemble ourselves togetherelves
[2:38:12] together in heavenly places in [music]
[2:38:13] Christ Jesus. Love one another.
[2:38:16] This will all men know you are my
[2:38:18] disciples when you have one love one for
[2:38:20] another. That's right. Stay right
[2:38:22] together. Brother Ram said, "Don't be
[2:38:25] clanish.
[2:38:38] I spoke to brother Joseph Brandham about
[2:38:41] this directly one on one.
[2:38:50] He came through town with the uh
[2:38:58] Voice of God tour years ago. Brother
[2:39:02] Joseph Dalton and Jim Dalton asked me if
[2:39:04] I would go to the meeting with them. So,
[2:39:06] they rented a a building downtown here
[2:39:09] in Phoenix. So, I went [snorts]
[2:39:14] and Joseph had just put out
[2:39:18] a booklet called Here I [music] Stand.
[2:39:22] Any of you remember Here I Stand? You
[2:39:25] remember him standing there with his
[2:39:27] Bible?
[2:39:28] Here
[2:39:33] I stand.
[2:39:35] It became the most divisive
[2:39:39] division causing element within the
[2:39:42] message
[2:39:44] at that very moment
[2:39:47] because now it was tapes only
[2:39:51] and five-fold ministry.
[2:39:53] So which is it? I want to ask you. I
[2:39:56] want to ask you, my church,
[2:40:00] do I believe in listening to tapes?
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; Do I try to propagate
[2:40:09] this ministry of the prophet rather than
[2:40:11] my own?
[2:40:14] &gt;&gt; Why do I put quotes up here?
[2:40:17] Why do I show you? Because I'm just not
[2:40:19] paraphrasing. I want you to see what he
[2:40:21] said.
[2:40:25] I believe in listening to tapes. I
[2:40:27] listen to tapes.
[2:40:29] I try to every day and and when I hear
[2:40:34] it, I I'm thrilled. It's it's like
[2:40:37] hearing the tape for the first time.
[2:40:41] See, there there's a doctrine permeating
[2:40:43] right among our own church. That's the
[2:40:47] reason that these questions arise. And
[2:40:50] so, I need to address them.
[2:40:54] Because the only time we can get a bunch
[2:40:56] of message believers together is for a
[2:40:59] funeral or a wedding.
[2:41:01] Not for a gospel meeting.
[2:41:06] Oh, hey Bob. Haven't seen you. It's 10
[2:41:09] [music] 10 years ago. Yeah. We used to
[2:41:11] go to church together. Yeah. Well,
[2:41:16] Uncle so and so died and we're here and
[2:41:19] Yeah, man. Hey, you doing okay? Yeah,
[2:41:22] we're all right. But you ain't had
[2:41:24] fellowship. Why? Because now you think
[2:41:27] differently. You believe a little bit
[2:41:29] differently
[2:41:32] until there's no fellowship.
[2:41:35] And the devil loves
[2:41:38] that you don't have fellowship with
[2:41:40] anyone else outside of your little
[2:41:42] group.
[2:41:44] And you might [music] be missing one of
[2:41:46] the greatest blessings that
[2:41:51] because you're so you're you're you got
[2:41:52] these blinders on. It's us and we're the
[2:41:55] only one. We're the elect and stay here
[2:41:57] and I'm your pastor and you can't go
[2:41:59] somewhere else. Listen, everybody in my
[2:42:02] church is happy.
[2:42:05] They're either happy to come
[2:42:08] or they're happy to go.
[2:42:11] I do not hold you.
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. Here's a let me make
[2:42:14] something else clear to you.
[2:42:18] We have visitors. Brother Robert, I want
[2:42:20] you to greet visitors. They're here from
[2:42:24] here and there. And I I've told Amos and
[2:42:26] Brother Pierre and you brethren, you
[2:42:28] deacons that stand at the door. If we've
[2:42:30] got visitors and we haven't seen them,
[2:42:33] their name, where are they from? Oh,
[2:42:34] you're from Canada. You're this, that,
[2:42:37] you're uh so and so. And then you greet
[2:42:39] them and and stuff because I don't have
[2:42:41] time to be up here. Oh, brother so and
[2:42:44] so. Oh, oh, yeah, you go. Oh, you're up
[2:42:46] here and God bless you. We'd sure love
[2:42:48] to have you at our church. We're so glad
[2:42:49] you're you're here. I'm not a
[2:42:51] procellator.
[2:42:53] And I don't sit here and welcome
[2:42:55] everybody into such a a a degree because
[2:42:59] you know what? They might just be
[2:43:01] visiting.
[2:43:04] Well, I'm not trying to pull them into
[2:43:06] our church. Do you understand that? I'm
[2:43:08] not.
[2:43:10] But I do think that we ought to be a
[2:43:12] very welcoming [music]
[2:43:13] church.
[2:43:14] &gt;&gt; It would be horrible for new visitors to
[2:43:18] come and visit with us
[2:43:22] and none of you shake their hand and
[2:43:23] make them feel welcome.
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; Terrible. [music]
[2:43:29] Why? If brother Robert doesn't tell you
[2:43:31] to stand up and turn around, shake one
[2:43:33] another's hand,
[2:43:35] some of you are
[2:43:37] you're resurrected when we say you are
[2:43:39] dismissed and you run to your car and
[2:43:42] get in your car and you're gone and you
[2:43:44] don't shake anybody's hand and God bless
[2:43:47] you. How are you? Have love one for
[2:43:49] another. How are you doing? There's some
[2:43:53] of you that I don't get to see because I
[2:43:56] go out of the church on this side. I
[2:43:59] think I'm going to start parking over
[2:44:00] here
[2:44:02] cuz there's half of those people.
[2:44:04] [laughter]
[2:44:08] We We get set in our ways, don't we?
[2:44:12] Some of you Congalles believers,
[2:44:17] I don't know your first and last name.
[2:44:20] And you've been coming here for years.
[2:44:25] I
[2:44:27] am
[2:44:29] Sorry,
[2:44:36] I want to know you.
[2:44:39] Some of you, you you you don't speak
[2:44:41] much English.
[2:44:43] Jean Pierre,
[2:44:46] he's come here to the Baya family. You
[2:44:47] know how proud I am of the Bay family.
[2:44:51] And hey, it's getting bigger. More more
[2:44:53] people.
[2:44:57] I don't have an opportunity to share
[2:45:00] with brother Jean Pierre because I don't
[2:45:02] speak French. Every time we visit,
[2:45:06] he speaks a little bit of English, I
[2:45:09] know a little bit of French. And so
[2:45:12] beyond just a few words, it stops. So
[2:45:16] unless I can speak to him through a
[2:45:18] translator, our fellowship can only go
[2:45:21] so far. But I appreciate it that when he
[2:45:23] comes, he comes here and he has to sit
[2:45:26] with a and I don't know who it is that's
[2:45:28] translating back there right now. Might
[2:45:30] be Emanuel or somebody.
[2:45:33] But
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:45:34] &gt;&gt; um many of you I don't know you
[2:45:38] on a firstname basis. And for that I'm
[2:45:41] sorry.
[2:45:43] I want to be a good pastor. I want to
[2:45:44] get to know you. I'd love to have
[2:45:46] everybody come over to my house but I
[2:45:49] can't do that. I try to have groups at a
[2:45:52] time rather than just one or two. I do
[2:45:55] the wife, bless her heart, I'll we get
[2:45:59] 20 25 people to come to our house,
[2:46:03] you know, and
[2:46:05] it's not so easy as it is just one or
[2:46:08] two couples.
[2:46:11] I've had Sam and Tiffany come in [music]
[2:46:13] town for months.
[2:46:19] I never get to take him to lunch.
[2:46:24] I'm sorry.
[2:46:36] I I'd love to say, "Hey, let's just go.
[2:46:41] I've got others from Canada.
[2:46:51] Samuel, you and Marina, [music]
[2:46:55] I don't get to visit with you guys very
[2:46:57] often.
[2:47:02] You think I take it lightly that you
[2:47:04] [music] come?
[2:47:07] Hey, Tim Robel,
[2:47:10] you think I take it lightly when I see
[2:47:12] you sitting on the back row over there?
[2:47:14] You think that I don't notice that
[2:47:15] you're there? You and Gabby and your
[2:47:17] kids.
[2:47:22] I'd love to take you all to lunch. I
[2:47:25] can't do it. So, Johnny Green will do it
[2:47:27] for me.
[2:47:30] [laughter]
[2:47:31] I see pictures. He's got a selfie and
[2:47:33] there's 20 or 30 people. They send it to
[2:47:37] me. I said, "God bless you, brother
[2:47:38] Johnny. That guy's good [music] stuff."
[2:47:41] Anyway, all of you
[2:47:45] I told Joel Franklin the other day,
[2:47:47] "Hey, brother Joel, you know what I'd
[2:47:49] like to do? I'd like to take some of
[2:47:50] these young men." I said, "Let's go to a
[2:47:52] ball game."
[2:47:57] And I said, "You and Amos just kind of
[2:47:59] figure out a time." I said, "Now, I'm
[2:48:01] not going to take all of the every one
[2:48:03] of you young guy because a lot of you
[2:48:04] guys, you know, you could care less go.
[2:48:06] You just would like to have a free meal
[2:48:07] and some something to do."
[2:48:11] Did I tell you that, Brother Joe? I
[2:48:14] said, because you know what?
[2:48:18] Let's sit down and talk about something
[2:48:20] you're interested in.
[2:48:22] Maybe you know the names of the all of
[2:48:25] the good baseball players and you know
[2:48:28] the name of the team and and this guy's
[2:48:30] batting average and his statistics and
[2:48:32] all of that stuff. I I don't know it,
[2:48:34] but you know what? I'll go there and
[2:48:36] I'll sit with you and you know what? I I
[2:48:39] watch a game even when I go to the when
[2:48:41] the brothers play
[2:48:44] and John Dubsky and I and different ones
[2:48:47] sit behind the plate and everything. I'm
[2:48:48] watching the game. All right. Come on,
[2:48:50] ISRAEL. KNOCK THAT THE YEAH, BUDDY. COME
[2:48:54] ON, JAMES. Knock it out of the park.
[2:48:57] [screaming] Yeah.
[2:49:01] Because whatsoever you do,
[2:49:06] do it with your whole heart. Do it with
[2:49:09] a passion.
[2:49:10] One thing about it, whatever you do in
[2:49:14] life, if you'll do it with a passion,
[2:49:16] you'll succeed.
[2:49:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:49:23] So, take a few of these guys, go with
[2:49:25] them, sit down, talk to them,
[2:49:29] visit with them. I used to be our youth
[2:49:31] leader for years and I knew every one of
[2:49:36] my young people.
[2:49:38] I knew their names.
[2:49:45] I I don't know all their names now.
[2:49:49] We got I'm just sharing you my heart
[2:49:53] this morning. Okay. This is as anointed
[2:49:57] as what I was
[2:49:59] on watch night. It's just a different
[2:50:02] anointing.
[2:50:04] Okay. I love you people and I'm
[2:50:08] I love you with a godly jealousy and I
[2:50:11] want to watch over you [music] and I
[2:50:13] want to protect you as best that I can
[2:50:15] and therefore when different ones ask
[2:50:17] these questions. Well, what about what's
[2:50:19] wrong? What's the difference between
[2:50:21] streaming and and and [music]
[2:50:23] those that uh stay home and press play?
[2:50:26] There's a vast difference. And I don't
[2:50:27] need to show you and tell you everything
[2:50:30] that's wrong about it. You need to get
[2:50:32] on your face before God and ask God to
[2:50:36] show you and then you find a church that
[2:50:39] you should be going into because
[2:50:43] the devil will divide you and conquer
[2:50:45] you and to just show you that those who
[2:50:50] only press play, invite them to come to
[2:50:52] church with you one time. See if they'll
[2:50:54] come in.
[2:50:58] Ain't no way. Ain't that we don't
[2:50:59] believe in that? You don't believe in
[2:51:01] what? Brother Bram said, "Will the would
[2:51:02] the bride of Christ have a ministry
[2:51:04] before the coming of the Lord?"
[2:51:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, no, no, no, no. It's just Brother
[2:51:10] Brennham.
[2:51:13] Just Brother Brennham. He's the only
[2:51:14] voice. He's the last voice. He's the
[2:51:16] final.
[2:51:18] Wait just a second. Have you did Did you
[2:51:22] keep reading? Did you keep listening? Or
[2:51:26] did you stop right there?
[2:51:29] I just say keep on. That's why I put you
[2:51:33] back in remembrance of what he said.
[2:51:36] Okay. Is this okay? I I I've held you.
[2:51:39] It's almost [music]
[2:51:40] uh 12:45. Wow.
[2:51:44] &gt;&gt; And thank you. [music] Thank you,
[2:51:56] Brian. Thank you for being here.
[2:52:05] Yeah. Yeah.
[2:52:07] Yeah.
[2:52:17] That's okay.
[2:52:20] I've got 11 pages of notes right here. I
[2:52:24] never even touched. It's actually 12
[2:52:26] pages, but
[2:52:29] the several pages that I had,
[2:52:33] I wanted to go over and kind of go over
[2:52:35] it slowly and visit with you. Is this
[2:52:39] okay?
[2:52:40] &gt;&gt; I I trust it is. And I I pray that I
[2:52:44] have the right attitude. I'm not going
[2:52:46] after anybody.
[2:52:50] I'm not I'm not
[2:52:53] I'm not God knows my heart.
[2:52:57] But there are spirits in this end time
[2:52:59] that are trying to deceive the people.
[2:53:01] Brother Brandham said, "I've got people
[2:53:03] I've got 15 or 20 people sitting right
[2:53:05] here in my church right now that believe
[2:53:07] I'm Jesus Christ."
[2:53:10] How many of them heard him say that? And
[2:53:13] he says, "How could they do that?" He
[2:53:15] says, "Why?" He said, "Of all the things
[2:53:18] that's ever come up in my own ministry,"
[2:53:22] he said, "I'm I'm leaving the ministry."
[2:53:25] He said, "It's Antichrist spirit."
[2:53:29] And he said, "If this would have been my
[2:53:30] enemy, I would have laughed." But he
[2:53:32] said, "Some of these are my best
[2:53:33] friends, and they're sitting right there
[2:53:36] looking at him." And I'll tell you what,
[2:53:39] in a church of about 150 people and you
[2:53:43] got 15 or [music] 20 people sitting
[2:53:44] right there, don't you think those
[2:53:46] people knew who the he was talking
[2:53:48] about?
[2:53:52] Yeah, absolutely,
[2:53:54] brother. Yeah, because he tells me
[2:53:55] Brother Bram's God. We baptized in
[2:53:58] Brother Bram's name. He's the new name
[2:54:00] of God. William Brandham
[2:54:03] on and on all these doctrines and
[2:54:05] different things. And brother Bram said,
[2:54:06] "I'd rather face God as a quitter
[2:54:11] than as an antichrist."
[2:54:13] He said, "All these years of ministry
[2:54:15] down the devil's [snorts] gutterpipe."
[2:54:19] He said, "It's an antichrist spirit.
[2:54:21] Don't you give heed to it. Don't you
[2:54:23] listen to it. You You go to church. You
[2:54:27] can't wait for those doors." Is this
[2:54:29] what he said? These are his doctrinal
[2:54:31] teachings.
[2:54:33] He said, "If I didn't believe in going
[2:54:35] to church, why would I have one?" Come
[2:54:37] on. That's common sense.
[2:54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. God bless you.
[2:54:46] Let's stand together this morning. And
[2:54:48] why don't you just before we leave, I'm
[2:54:50] not going to wait for Robert to do it.
[2:54:52] I'm going to tell you, turn around and
[2:54:54] shake somebody's hand. And if you don't
[2:54:56] know them, say, "We are so glad you came
[2:54:59] to church today and God bless you.
[2:55:02] Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. You guys are
[2:55:05] even smiling. Wow.
[2:55:10] That's it.
