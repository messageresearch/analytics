[41:30] Lord we've worshiped you we've
[41:32] sensitized our hearts and our spirits
[41:34] and
[41:35] we're asking now Lord that by the
[41:37] foolishness of preaching that Souls
[41:39] would be saved lives would be encouraged
[41:41] the sick would be healed Lord that our
[41:44] lives would be changed and so we're
[41:46] putting our trust in you Lord for all
[41:49] things for where else would we go
[41:52] where else can we go Lord so to you we
[41:55] come this evening we give you our all
[41:57] our lives our hearts our minds and we
[42:01] ask that your name would be glorified we
[42:03] thank you Lord we love you bless your
[42:05] people we pray in the name of Jesus

[42:13] good to be gathered in the house of the
[42:14] Lord if you have your Bibles turn with

[42:30] The Book of Psalms chapter 107.
[42:35] and verse 20 and it says
[42:38] he sent his word
[42:40] and healed them
[42:41] and delivered them from their
[42:44] destructions notice what he sent he sent
[42:47] his word
[42:48] and he healed him amen Isaiah 53 and
[42:51] verse 5.
[42:56] very familiar portion of scripture
[43:03] Isaiah 53 and verse 5 and it says but he
[43:08] was wounded for our transgressions
[43:11] he was bruised for our iniquities notice
[43:14] it didn't say his iniquities but our
[43:18] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[43:21] was upon him
[43:23] and with his stripes
[43:25] we are healed
[43:27] hallelujah what a promise Luke chapter 8
[43:31] and verse 47.
[43:45] Luke chapter 8 and verse 47.
[43:50] and it says and when the woman saw that
[43:53] she was not hid she came trembling
[43:57] and falling down before him she declared
[43:59] unto him before all the people for what
[44:02] caused she had touched him
[44:04] and how she was healed immediately amen
[44:08] you may have your seats this evening
[44:13] I would like to title my sermon this
[44:15] evening
[44:16] the great physician is here
[44:19] with the subject of Believers belief
[44:26] because putting Simplicity that's what
[44:29] believers do is Believers believe and as
[44:33] Believers what do we believe for We
[44:36] Believe for the impossible to be made
[44:38] possible we believe for God to come on
[44:41] the scene and to meet all of our needs
[44:43] no matter what the game Sayers may say
[44:46] no matter what the doctors may say no
[44:49] matter what anybody else may tell us
[44:51] Believers believe
[44:55] you know that's what we're good at right
[44:58] the unbeliever he'll say well I don't
[45:00] believe that well it's not for you to
[45:03] believe it because it's for believers
[45:05] so now as Believers we have a portion in
[45:09] the great drama of God to play and
[45:12] that's believing in the word of God
[45:15] Hallelujah so are you playing your part
[45:18] this evening
[45:23] what are we believing
[45:25] leave it word
[45:28] all things are possible
[45:30] to who to the unbelievers
[45:33] all things are possible to them who'd
[45:36] what who believe
[45:39] Hallelujah
[45:41] sometimes as a minister
[45:44] we get to pray before God and we wonder
[45:46] Lord what would you have us to minister
[45:47] to your people
[45:49] Lord Give Me A Channel give me a thought
[45:52] give me a a direction in which you would
[45:54] want us to minister on and I couldn't
[45:57] find the quote but I know brother
[45:58] Branham said it he said sometimes what a
[46:01] minister will do is he'll look across
[46:03] the congregation and he'll see the needs
[46:06] that's upon the people's lives and
[46:08] that's the inspiration that he'll preach
[46:11] upon
[46:12] if there's ever if we've ever had a need
[46:15] within our assembly of healing within
[46:18] our bodies it's at this very time
[46:22] I don't think of all the years that I've
[46:24] been here I've never seen so many
[46:26] sicknesses so many ailments so many
[46:30] heart attacks and and diseases and all
[46:33] these different things that's attacking
[46:35] this local assembly at this very time
[46:38] and I thought to myself there's no
[46:40] better time than to preach a sermon on
[46:43] the great physician is now here
[46:49] you say brother Stephen well why would
[46:52] you want to preach that do you want to
[46:54] preach it to make the people feel uh uh
[46:57] bad because they haven't received their
[46:59] healing yet quite the contrary
[47:01] because whatever we preach that is the
[47:05] fruit that's going to come forth from
[47:07] our ministering
[47:08] so if we begin to preach salvation guess
[47:11] what those who are amongst us who have
[47:13] never give their hearts to Christ
[47:14] they'll receive salvation it's no
[47:17] different with healing when there's a
[47:20] need of healing amongst us and we begin
[47:22] to preach on healing and the the divine
[47:25] power of Jesus Christ to heal the body
[47:29] guess what's going to happen
[47:31] because what does it do it ignites our
[47:33] faith
[47:35] that is my desire this evening that our
[47:39] faith level would go higher than it's
[47:41] ever been before it's not something that
[47:45] we have to work up it's not something
[47:47] that we have to make believe in it's
[47:49] just something that we have to preach
[47:51] which is the word
[47:55] it's not just any kind of word it's the
[47:57] spoken word of God
[47:59] and the word of God Is Spoken it has an
[48:02] effect Upon Our Lives
[48:08] Hallelujah
[48:11] these needs in our lives are actually
[48:13] opportunities for God
[48:16] to come on the scene
[48:18] nothing is impossible with God
[48:23] there's nothing that's in our lives in
[48:26] our mental Minds a sickness within our
[48:30] body a trouble within our family that is
[48:33] too difficult for God not to take care
[48:35] of
[48:36] why because we serve on almighty God who
[48:41] is greater
[48:43] he's greater than any sickness he's
[48:45] greater than any trial he's greater than
[48:47] any mountain we serve a God who is
[48:50] greater than anything that comes in our
[48:52] lives
[48:57] we are experiencing something within our
[49:01] assembly and I'm sure you can all agree
[49:03] that
[49:04] at one point it would have been uh when
[49:08] a cliche
[49:10] that when one member of the body suffers
[49:13] the rest of the body suffers it's very
[49:16] easy to say
[49:18] but this last probably since the
[49:20] beginning of the year
[49:22] you can feel it
[49:24] feel it in your spirit you can feel it
[49:27] in your heart you sense like a a
[49:29] heaviness
[49:31] for a better word to say that's amongst
[49:34] us and why is that it's not a it's not a
[49:37] heaviness because we are a defeated and
[49:39] an oppressed people
[49:41] it's a heaviness because the needs and
[49:44] the the issues that our friends and our
[49:47] family and loved ones are going through
[49:48] is burdensome to us because when one
[49:52] member of one of the body suffers
[49:56] the rest of us are feeling it it's no
[50:00] longer a cliche but it's a reality
[50:05] so what does it cause us now as a body
[50:07] of Believers it causes us to come
[50:10] together it causes us to pray one for
[50:13] another like we've never prayed before
[50:15] why because the burden is there like it
[50:18] never was before
[50:22] where does the burden come from it comes
[50:25] from God Almighty if God puts a burden
[50:27] on your heart for the person that's
[50:29] sitting next to you you better reach out
[50:31] and pray for that person why because
[50:33] perhaps God is using you as an
[50:36] intercessor for that person
[50:43] I'll wait until tomorrow
[50:45] don't put off until tomorrow what can be
[50:49] done today
[50:51] Hallelujah
[50:53] ah we get so complexed with life and uh
[50:57] uh uh you know well that person and and
[51:00] I don't even know that person and that's
[51:02] not nonsense when God places something
[51:05] on your heart let me tell you you better
[51:06] do it
[51:10] yes sir Hallelujah
[51:12] because perhaps God is wanting to use
[51:14] you
[51:15] as an individual
[51:18] not anybody else but you and he's
[51:21] putting it on your heart
[51:23] he woke you up at midnight
[51:25] well I'm too tired to pray
[51:28] he woke you up for a purpose he put that
[51:31] person on your heart for a purpose why
[51:33] because he's wanting to use you as an
[51:35] intercessor
[51:36] hallelujah what is this all doing it's
[51:39] playing your part in the local body
[51:43] that's the unsung heroes
[51:45] as the unsung heroes of laodiacia that's
[51:48] the unsung heroes of evening Light
[51:50] Fellowship those who are burdened in
[51:53] their hearts who aren't scared to get on
[51:55] their knees
[51:57] amen amen
[52:00] this is a shaking time where God is
[52:03] taking out of our lives a wood the hay
[52:05] and the stubble
[52:07] he's taken out of our Lives the trash of
[52:10] laodiacia because he's wanting us to
[52:13] come closer and have a greater
[52:15] relationship with him
[52:17] why is he shaken me because he wants you
[52:20] to come forth as pure gold
[52:23] he doesn't want the wood and the hay and
[52:25] the stubble of louder you see it to be
[52:27] mixed in with it but he wants it to be
[52:30] pure beaten goat Hallelujah
[52:38] Hallelujah
[52:41] now I realize as we get started on this
[52:44] this evening in this service that
[52:47] Divine Healing is a minor
[52:50] and it is not a major in the plan of God
[52:53] we realize that and we understand that
[52:56] now some will say brother Stephen you're
[52:58] you're preaching way back here in the
[53:00] first pull of brother Brown's Ministry
[53:03] brother Branham had three pulls and
[53:05] we're in the third pool and you're way
[53:07] back here preaching on the first pull of
[53:09] his ministry
[53:12] though that may be true
[53:15] that doesn't mean that we as Ministry
[53:17] cannot preach on the subject of Divine
[53:20] Healing
[53:23] because though he moved from the first
[53:25] pulled to the second pull it never done
[53:27] away with the first pull
[53:30] though he went from the second pull to
[53:32] the third pull it never done away with
[53:34] it completely though we have moved on in
[53:37] maturity to the spoken word it doesn't
[53:40] mean that we can't have faith for Divine
[53:43] Healing in our lives like the scripture
[53:45] says
[53:51] Hallelujah we realize that healing is
[53:54] still an attribute of God
[53:56] that is included within the finished
[53:58] work of calvary
[54:00] and because it was included in the work
[54:03] of Calvary it can never be taken out
[54:06] therefore as long as we are here we can
[54:10] preach Divine Healing as long as we
[54:13] don't major on the minor
[54:17] it's okay to be a minor once in a while
[54:19] as long as we're not majoring on it
[54:23] hahaha
[54:26] so just for a little time tonight
[54:28] what is time to God anyways for a little
[54:31] space of time for 45 minutes we're going
[54:34] to minor on a minor
[54:37] don't want to stumble some of you by
[54:40] saying we're gonna major on a minor
[54:44] 1956 here ye him brother Branham said no
[54:47] I want to say to you last night tonight
[54:50] was Evangelistic call friends Divine
[54:53] Healing is just a minor you can never
[54:56] major on a minor as I said salvation of
[54:59] the soul is much greater than Divine
[55:01] Healing hallelujah what is the use of
[55:04] Divine Healing if the soul is on its way
[55:07] to hell
[55:09] get this soul on its way to heaven get
[55:13] this Soul born again then we can kind of
[55:16] preach on the minor of Divine Healing
[55:19] why because we're not majoring on it
[55:24] beloved I wish above all the dumbass
[55:26] prosper and be in health
[55:28] even as thy soul prospers
[55:31] and is in health
[55:33] glory amen
[55:36] yes sir
[55:39] he said Divine Healing was included in
[55:41] the new atonement because the old
[55:43] atonement had healing in it and the new
[55:45] ones are much better C than the old if
[55:48] the old one could furnish healing what
[55:50] about the new one but Divine Healing is
[55:53] not on the same basis as salvation when
[55:56] you're born again you get an immortal
[55:57] spirit and cannot die but when you're
[56:00] healed by Divine Healing you will get
[56:02] sick and die again Lazarus did and all
[56:05] the rest of them he even raised from the
[56:07] dead but it's the attribute of his
[56:09] resurrection notice that Divine Healing
[56:12] is the attribute of his resurrection
[56:15] because he is alive those attributes are
[56:19] still alive so because he is alive the
[56:22] things that he did back here he still
[56:24] does today because his attributes never
[56:27] change
[56:30] but it's the attribute of his
[56:32] resurrection and it's the earnest of our
[56:34] resurrection that we will see God said
[56:37] so now it's in the Bible
[56:41] why do you believe in Divine Healing
[56:43] because it's in the Bible and anything
[56:47] that's in the Bible we can believe it
[56:50] anything that's written within the
[56:52] scriptures not only can we believe it
[56:54] but we can take it and we can apply it
[56:57] to our lives
[57:01] Hallelujah
[57:04] my desire is this this evening that we
[57:07] might see the attributes of God within
[57:09] his scriptures that our faith could come
[57:12] to a level for those things which we are
[57:14] in need of
[57:19] let's bring our faith up a little bit
[57:21] higher
[57:22] because some of you think that you don't
[57:25] have faith
[57:27] and that's a lie and we're going to
[57:29] prove it tonight you do got faith you
[57:32] actually got plenty of Faith you've got
[57:34] more faith than what you think you know
[57:36] you got
[57:39] you actually use your faith unknowingly
[57:43] in other things
[57:45] so now it's just taken that channel of
[57:48] faith and applying it to a different uh
[57:51] place in our lives
[57:56] Hebrews 11 verse 6 but without faith it
[57:59] is impossible to please him for he that
[58:01] cometh to God must for must believe that
[58:05] he is you got to believe that God is and
[58:09] that he is a rewarder of those that
[58:11] diligently seek Him Romans 10 verse 17
[58:14] so then Faith cometh by hearing and
[58:17] hearing by the word of God
[58:19] so in order to have faith in a certain
[58:22] subject first of all we've got to hear
[58:25] it
[58:26] from the word of God
[58:29] because Faith cometh by hearing and by
[58:31] hearing the word of God so if we need to
[58:34] have faith and for a healing attribute
[58:37] within our bodies guess what we need to
[58:39] hear
[58:40] we need to hear what the Bible says
[58:42] about healing we need to hear what it
[58:45] says that our faith might be elevated to
[58:48] a place like it's never been before
[58:54] we've got to hear what the word of God
[58:55] says about this subject
[58:57] not what brother Stephen says about this
[59:00] subject but what the word says about
[59:02] this subject because we put our faith
[59:05] and our trust in the word
[59:09] amen
[59:12] all of you can agree to this that before
[59:15] you can have faith for salvation first
[59:19] of all you had to hear the word about
[59:22] salvation
[59:24] how could you know that you ever needed
[59:26] to be saved if no one ever told you
[59:29] how could you know that Jesus Christ uh
[59:31] uh Saint John 3 16 for Gods who loved
[59:34] the world that he give his only begotten
[59:36] son that whosoever believes in him they
[59:39] shall never perish but they shall have
[59:41] everlasting life if nobody never shared
[59:45] the scripture with you through the
[59:47] hearing of your ear you would never have
[59:49] come to the understanding that he died
[59:52] for your sins
[59:57] how can I know unless somebody tells me
[59:59] how do I know what the scripture says if
[1:00:02] I've never read it myself unless
[1:00:04] somebody speaks it to me
[1:00:13] you might not have caught it the first
[1:00:15] time that you heard it
[1:00:19] without being born again guess what
[1:00:21] you're on a Highway to Hell
[1:00:24] without having an experience with Jesus
[1:00:27] Christ guess what your life is going to
[1:00:29] be an absolute turmoil
[1:00:32] but when you accept Christ into your
[1:00:34] life guess what now you have an advocate
[1:00:37] before the father and you have a peace
[1:00:39] in your life that passes all of
[1:00:41] understanding you might not have caught
[1:00:44] it the first time you heard the sermon
[1:00:46] it might have taken years in sitting in
[1:00:48] the Pew but at one time you caught it at
[1:00:52] least I hope you caught it and if you
[1:00:54] haven't caught it yet you need to catch
[1:00:56] it
[1:00:57] yes sir
[1:00:59] yes sir it's time to repent
[1:01:01] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:01:03] for the remission of your sins what do I
[1:01:07] need to repent of you need to repent of
[1:01:09] being you you need to repent of your old
[1:01:12] carnal life
[1:01:14] not just coming to church not just
[1:01:16] saying prayers and paying your tithes
[1:01:19] but repenting and turning from your evil
[1:01:21] ways
[1:01:27] my we think uh in a message Church no
[1:01:30] one should need to repent
[1:01:32] might surprise us
[1:01:34] I gotta repent on a daily basis
[1:01:37] I don't have to ask God to if I'm saved
[1:01:41] on a daily basis but I need to repent on
[1:01:43] a daily basis that's why I'm preaching I
[1:01:46] know you need to repent on a daily basis
[1:01:53] you know what this message did
[1:01:56] this message brought us to a place you
[1:02:00] know the the Presbyterians and the
[1:02:02] methodists and the different ones
[1:02:03] they're always rushing to the altar
[1:02:05] every service oh I I want to be saved
[1:02:07] and I want to be saved and and I just
[1:02:09] want to be saved and I don't want to
[1:02:10] make no mistakes anymore but this
[1:02:12] message came and it gave us a balance
[1:02:16] for us to realize Who We Are
[1:02:21] it has given us a balance to where we
[1:02:23] realize
[1:02:24] I don't need to be asked I don't need to
[1:02:27] ask to be saved every day but I do need
[1:02:30] to repent every day
[1:02:33] and the closer we get with God the more
[1:02:35] we realize the more I need to repent
[1:02:37] the closer we get with God the more we
[1:02:39] realize I am a wretched miserable man
[1:02:44] that I am
[1:02:46] the closer you get with God the more you
[1:02:49] realize the more you need God
[1:02:57] Hallelujah
[1:03:04] so before we could believe in Salvation
[1:03:06] we had to hear the word first and when
[1:03:10] we heard the word at some point in our
[1:03:12] lives something happened it ignited a
[1:03:16] faith in our hearts where we realize
[1:03:18] because what is Faith it's a revelation
[1:03:22] of the word of God and we realized it by
[1:03:25] Revelation I need a savior
[1:03:28] and I need to repent of my sins
[1:03:32] what a revelation that is to us as the
[1:03:37] bride so important
[1:03:41] but let me say this
[1:03:43] if you have got
[1:03:45] Faith to believe that you're saved
[1:03:49] how many of you doubt that you're saved
[1:03:51] this evening
[1:03:52] I would say if some were honest there
[1:03:55] baby a couple that will raise their
[1:03:57] hands
[1:03:58] probably because I've never met God face
[1:04:02] to face quite yet
[1:04:05] which is okay your time is coming
[1:04:09] but how many of you are praying on a
[1:04:11] daily basis oh God save me God please
[1:04:13] save me I just need to be saved
[1:04:16] no we're repenting of the things that
[1:04:19] we've done wrong therefore
[1:04:21] we have faith in the finished work of
[1:04:25] Calvary for our salvation
[1:04:29] now I'm getting to something because a
[1:04:32] lot of people think they don't have
[1:04:33] faith
[1:04:35] but you have faith enough to say that
[1:04:37] you're a Christian can you say Amen
[1:04:39] you have faith enough to say that you've
[1:04:42] been baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:04:44] Christ and you've got the Holy Ghost you
[1:04:47] have faith enough
[1:04:49] excuse me you have faith enough to say
[1:04:52] that you believe the message of the hour
[1:04:53] you have faith enough to say that you're
[1:04:56] a part of the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:04:59] you're trying to tell me you don't have
[1:05:00] faith
[1:05:01] you have faith enough to say that if you
[1:05:03] were to die this evening that you'd go
[1:05:05] to heaven
[1:05:06] you have faith enough to believe for
[1:05:09] your family and their salvation
[1:05:11] and then you let Satan tell you that you
[1:05:13] don't have faith
[1:05:16] you've got plenty of Faith you're just
[1:05:19] using it in a different avenue why
[1:05:21] because you have faith in the finished
[1:05:24] work
[1:05:25] now healing is part of the finished work
[1:05:29] we pray all the time God thank you for
[1:05:32] saving me thank you for setting me free
[1:05:34] thank you for what you've done for me we
[1:05:37] need to take that Avenue of Faith
[1:05:39] towards the healing of our bodies
[1:05:42] father thank you for how you've touched
[1:05:45] me thank you for my healing thank you
[1:05:47] for what you've done I may not recognize
[1:05:50] it yet in my body but at work is already
[1:05:52] finished
[1:05:55] we don't need to keep praying God please
[1:05:57] heal me please heal me
[1:06:00] but God thank you for what you've done
[1:06:02] thank you for touching my body thank you
[1:06:05] for touching my children that's speaking
[1:06:08] by faith in the word of God
[1:06:12] it's no different
[1:06:14] it's no different than thanking God for
[1:06:16] your salvation even though you make
[1:06:19] mistakes on a daily basis
[1:06:21] even if I feel sicker tomorrow
[1:06:24] we're still going to thank God
[1:06:26] for touching me because he's already
[1:06:29] touched you
[1:06:32] what is it that you're believing for
[1:06:34] this evening there's so many needs
[1:06:37] within our body it's time for us to
[1:06:39] start thanking God for what he's already
[1:06:41] done at Calvary
[1:06:43] and saying Lord the circumstance may not
[1:06:46] be good and the doctor May say it
[1:06:49] doesn't look good but your word says
[1:06:52] that by your stripes I am healed to buy
[1:06:56] your stripes my family is healed my
[1:06:58] children are healed the different people
[1:07:00] in my family are already healed
[1:07:03] I just gotta accept it just like we
[1:07:06] accepted salvation
[1:07:11] instead of having a I don't want to I'm
[1:07:14] not gonna say that instead of feeling
[1:07:16] sorry for ourselves and we got every
[1:07:19] right to feel sorry for ourselves
[1:07:21] sometimes
[1:07:24] according to the flesh man
[1:07:27] but why should we
[1:07:30] why should we if there's a promise
[1:07:32] that's written within the word of God
[1:07:34] that'll bring us out of our pity party
[1:07:36] that'll bring us out of feeling sorry
[1:07:38] for ourselves and into the Promised word
[1:07:41] of the hour
[1:07:45] you do got faith you do got faith to
[1:07:48] believe
[1:07:54] it's already within you
[1:07:56] it's already within the seed
[1:07:58] and what is happening with these
[1:08:00] situations it's bringing the life and
[1:08:02] the attributes of God out of the sea
[1:08:08] I'm going to read a quote where brother
[1:08:10] Branham says
[1:08:12] people say yeah with all things With God
[1:08:14] all things are possible but brother
[1:08:16] Branham says yeah but if with you all
[1:08:20] things are possible to you who would
[1:08:23] believe
[1:08:28] so this isn't something that we need to
[1:08:31] try to work up and we need to fast and
[1:08:33] pray and fast and pray no we just need
[1:08:35] to take God at his word
[1:08:39] just like we do on a daily basis for
[1:08:42] salvation
[1:08:46] we need to take that same faith
[1:08:48] and now channel it in a different
[1:08:50] direction
[1:08:54] little Josiah they said yeah yeah bad
[1:08:57] news bad news ain't going to be good
[1:08:58] it's not good it's not good

[1:09:20] that this and that
[1:09:22] and now look

[1:09:26] it's going to be 24-hour care you're
[1:09:28] never going to be in church come to
[1:09:29] church on a Sunday
[1:09:32] on the church on a Wednesday night
[1:09:34] what's happening it's little victories
[1:09:37] [Music]
[1:09:41] little victories
[1:09:43] may not happen all at once but a little
[1:09:46] Victory adds to a little Victory and a
[1:09:49] little Victory out to a little Victory
[1:09:51] it may not be easy at that time but a
[1:09:55] victory is a victory
[1:09:57] David little Theo was a victory
[1:10:02] it's a victory
[1:10:07] we've got people in the assembly they've
[1:10:09] got cancer and different things let me
[1:10:12] tell you God is our victory
[1:10:14] and his word will not fail us
[1:10:22] my mom's the same way
[1:10:24] dropped 18 pounds in a couple of months
[1:10:28] and and uh her stomach began to swell
[1:10:31] and everything and and stuff she's
[1:10:34] vomiting she's all she's sick
[1:10:37] so she goes gets blood tests done yeah
[1:10:39] you got cancer okay thanks a lot
[1:10:42] yeah well uh first of all it is uh let's
[1:10:45] get blood tests done eight weeks later
[1:10:47] they make you wait
[1:10:49] great thank you does my faith the world
[1:10:53] good
[1:10:54] and they say you got some
[1:10:56] abnormalities okay what is it it's
[1:10:59] cancerous okay
[1:11:00] praise the Lord
[1:11:02] and so my parents call me and they tell
[1:11:04] me and I'm thinking the last time my mom
[1:11:07] had cancer
[1:11:08] they called me and I say mom you're
[1:11:10] going to be fine
[1:11:11] well she ended up being fine so this
[1:11:13] time they call me son what do you think
[1:11:15] oh man
[1:11:17] say Mom it doesn't sound good
[1:11:21] because of your body and you're you're
[1:11:24] throwing up and you can't eat and you
[1:11:25] can't drink and these different things
[1:11:27] and they don't know what's going on with
[1:11:29] their what they don't know what where it
[1:11:31] is or what
[1:11:32] I said but we believe
[1:11:34] and a god of Miracles
[1:11:37] you see we can't our faith doesn't tell
[1:11:40] us just to put a blindfold on and to say
[1:11:43] this isn't real this isn't real
[1:11:46] get behind me Satan this isn't real it's
[1:11:48] real
[1:11:49] it's real
[1:11:51] but because it's real
[1:11:54] we believe in An Almighty God
[1:11:57] who is greater than any cancer cells
[1:12:00] that's within the body
[1:12:04] so we can acknowledge the truth that's
[1:12:07] happening but we also acknowledge God
[1:12:11] and his word and having faith in his
[1:12:14] word for this present stage of Our Lives
[1:12:18] finally we can acknowledge it but we'll
[1:12:21] dwell on the word of God rather than the
[1:12:23] doctors and what they say
[1:12:29] God is good
[1:12:35] I believe in the third pool Ministry of
[1:12:37] brother Branham
[1:12:38] I believe in speaking the word and I
[1:12:42] believe that it will be sovereignly
[1:12:43] given at times
[1:12:46] but I also believe
[1:12:48] the many people's faith is being
[1:12:51] stagnated
[1:12:52] because they're waiting for something to
[1:12:54] happen in that third pool Ministry
[1:12:58] now notice this
[1:13:00] let me ask you a question
[1:13:02] what if God give somebody else within
[1:13:05] the assembly
[1:13:07] The Sovereign spoken word to their need
[1:13:10] in their family
[1:13:12] how would you feel
[1:13:14] if somebody's dog was sick
[1:13:17] and here you are with a great need in
[1:13:19] your life
[1:13:20] and someone's dog was sick
[1:13:22] and God speaks to them
[1:13:24] say to this mountain
[1:13:26] say to the sickness that's within this
[1:13:28] dog to come out in the name of Jesus
[1:13:30] Christ
[1:13:31] and the dog is going to live
[1:13:34] how would you feel
[1:13:35] if somebody did if God sovereignly did
[1:13:39] that for someone else in their dog and
[1:13:41] not for you and your situation
[1:13:43] would you be jealous
[1:13:46] would you be mad
[1:13:48] would you lose faith in God
[1:13:51] God used that on a little fishy
[1:13:57] a little insignificant fishy
[1:14:00] and brother Branham said there was many
[1:14:02] a little child was laying within
[1:14:04] the hospital he said why would God chose
[1:14:08] to speak to that little fishy like that
[1:14:10] because he wants to show us that God
[1:14:13] cares about the little things
[1:14:20] God can do what he wants
[1:14:23] so now in the meantime
[1:14:25] while we're waiting we shouldn't be
[1:14:28] waiting in unbelief for something like
[1:14:31] that to happen
[1:14:33] there was other people on the mountain
[1:14:35] that day when brother Branham was
[1:14:36] hunting but God chose brother Brannon
[1:14:40] God may not choose any of us to speak
[1:14:43] the word like he did with brother
[1:14:44] Branham
[1:14:46] though he might
[1:14:49] but
[1:14:51] we should have faith in God's word
[1:14:55] the weather he uses us to speak the word
[1:14:59] to a situation or not we should still
[1:15:02] have faith in this Divine word of God
[1:15:05] that will never fail that our needs will
[1:15:09] be met anyways
[1:15:15] some people are waiting why wait
[1:15:19] well God if you'll just let me speak the
[1:15:21] word let me tell you we can speak the
[1:15:24] word from the very word itself
[1:15:26] that's what we're doing this evening
[1:15:28] we're speaking from the word of God
[1:15:39] we are forgetting that we still have to
[1:15:41] walk by faith
[1:15:42] and not by sight
[1:15:44] a lot of times we are not exercising our
[1:15:47] faith like we should be
[1:15:50] sure we're exercising it over here and
[1:15:53] we're thanking God over here but the
[1:15:55] needs that are over here in our lives
[1:15:57] how about once in a while we begin to
[1:15:59] exercise our faith in this side also
[1:16:05] stop asking and start believing
[1:16:09] faith is not believing that God cares
[1:16:12] all this is so good faith is not
[1:16:15] believing that God can but believing
[1:16:17] that God will
[1:16:19] oh
[1:16:21] Glory
[1:16:24] God will do it
[1:16:26] when I don't know but my faith tells me
[1:16:29] that it's going to happen
[1:16:33] he said brother Stephen is just just
[1:16:34] towards Divine Healing this is towards
[1:16:37] issues in your marriage
[1:16:42] you gotta load down good for nothing
[1:16:44] husband you have faith in God that God
[1:16:46] will turn his life around that God will
[1:16:49] put him on his back with his heels in
[1:16:51] the air let me tell you he'll turn
[1:16:53] around
[1:16:55] you got a wife that you feel is where
[1:16:58] she should be and submissive
[1:17:01] submit her to God
[1:17:05] will take care of it
[1:17:09] but you got to have faith in it
[1:17:14] oh I want a wife have faith in God
[1:17:17] he provides your wife at the right time
[1:17:19] I want to get married I want to have a
[1:17:20] hug yeah
[1:17:21] God will provide it in the right time
[1:17:23] just have faith
[1:17:26] Hallelujah
[1:17:28] what faith
[1:17:31] amen the second-handed robe
[1:17:33] this is a lengthy
[1:17:35] quote but it's very good uh 19
[1:17:39] 56 paragraph 76 brother Branham says a
[1:17:42] few weeks ago
[1:17:44] sister wood here and brother wood two
[1:17:46] bosom friends of ours here at the church
[1:17:48] I was in Michigan with my friends Leo
[1:17:50] and Gene we had left the Chicago meeting
[1:17:52] and went with some of their people for
[1:17:55] two days to go deer hunting with bows
[1:17:56] and arrows no my wrote back my wife had
[1:17:59] got a hold of me and she said
[1:18:01] pray for Miss Wood's mother a cancer is
[1:18:04] eaten off her face I never seen sister
[1:18:06] wood so alarmed she's weeping sister
[1:18:09] wood has always been a hero of Faith
[1:18:11] since God healed her boy of a crippled
[1:18:13] leg and healed her of TB and so forth
[1:18:15] but she had given down
[1:18:18] sounds a little bit like uh like John
[1:18:21] the Baptist doesn't it John was full of
[1:18:23] Faith until they put him in jail they
[1:18:25] put him in jail long enough to where he
[1:18:27] started to disbelieve that that what he
[1:18:29] knew was truth was really truth
[1:18:32] Allelujah some of us need to break out
[1:18:33] of the jail cell
[1:18:35] because the longer you're in the jail
[1:18:37] cell
[1:18:38] the longer you'll feel that it's not the
[1:18:40] truth
[1:18:42] God help us
[1:18:45] he said there at the room that night we
[1:18:47] prayed coming in Miss Wood said brother
[1:18:49] Branham we'll go over and we went to her
[1:18:51] mother which was in Louisville and she
[1:18:53] had a cancer on the side of her nose and
[1:18:56] the doctor had tampered with it and
[1:18:57] Scattered it till just a little ring the
[1:19:00] side of her nose and up just about an
[1:19:02] eighth of an inch from her eye just the
[1:19:03] bone lay in there done eating it just as
[1:19:06] fast as it could eat away
[1:19:08] go into the room and I knelt down I want
[1:19:11] to speak to her alone
[1:19:12] and I goes into the room to pray with
[1:19:14] the woman and while in the room I
[1:19:16] thought now notice this because I was I
[1:19:20] mentioned on on uh leaning on the third
[1:19:25] pool and speaking the word and just
[1:19:26] staying dormant right notice brother
[1:19:28] Branham did this very same thing with
[1:19:31] the gift in his life
[1:19:34] uh he said oh God if you'll just show me
[1:19:38] a vision of what's going to happen to
[1:19:39] the woman
[1:19:41] now notice now he's not walking by faith
[1:19:45] now he's walking about what he sees
[1:19:48] he said oh God just show me something
[1:19:50] about the woman so I can tell the people
[1:19:55] he said
[1:19:56] I miss Mr Miss Wood on the outside
[1:19:59] waiting to see what the vision would say
[1:20:01] but while I was there
[1:20:03] I got condemned
[1:20:05] I was condemned by waiting for a vision
[1:20:14] seemed like something referred back
[1:20:16] wasn't the calling
[1:20:19] what you need a vision when the promise
[1:20:21] is already been said
[1:20:26] so we don't need to wait for something
[1:20:28] that's a future event but just have
[1:20:31] promise and what the word of God says
[1:20:33] have faith and the promises of the word
[1:20:36] of God
[1:20:40] he had so conditioned himself to he was
[1:20:44] always seeing visions there was another
[1:20:46] quote I read where brother Branham said
[1:20:48] I haven't done a prayer line without
[1:20:49] having a vision in a very long time but
[1:20:53] I'm going to do it tonight he got so
[1:20:55] dependent upon the Visions where he was
[1:20:59] almost forgetting how to walk and Pray
[1:21:01] by faith
[1:21:03] God help us if that happened to the
[1:21:06] prophet it can happen to us
[1:21:08] God prank our conscience tonight
[1:21:11] to have faith Lord
[1:21:13] for the impossible because it's written
[1:21:18] greater is he that is within you than he
[1:21:21] who is in the world
[1:21:23] these works that I do shall ye do also
[1:21:26] now we're quoting the word and greater
[1:21:29] than these shall you do because I go
[1:21:30] unto my father
[1:21:32] greater is he that's within you
[1:21:35] and he that's within the world
[1:21:41] he said what you uh wasn't calling what
[1:21:44] you need a vision when the promises
[1:21:46] already been said so I knelt down and
[1:21:48] prayed no vision
[1:21:50] no nothing
[1:21:55] I'm all praying something just anchored
[1:21:58] on the inside
[1:21:59] the faith of the promise
[1:22:01] Hallelujah
[1:22:03] come back out Miss Wood when I told her
[1:22:05] about it she said did you see anything
[1:22:06] brother Brownell what did you see tell
[1:22:08] me what you seen
[1:22:11] I said I never exactly seen anything but
[1:22:14] I felt something that told me that his
[1:22:16] promise was true and he was going to do
[1:22:18] it and I believe that he's going to do
[1:22:21] it now he's walking by faith
[1:22:23] and in less than 24 hours the end of
[1:22:25] that cancer began to break away and the
[1:22:27] scab form over it cancers don't scab as
[1:22:30] you know unless it's dead so there it
[1:22:32] was now and the woman is healed and home
[1:22:34] what a wonderful Christ by keeping our
[1:22:37] eyes on the promise
[1:22:41] God said so
[1:22:44] so let it be done
[1:22:49] but when we are prayed for sometimes we
[1:22:51] go off and say well it wasn't done just
[1:22:54] immediately so maybe we better go back
[1:22:57] again oh no
[1:23:00] keep your eye on the promise
[1:23:04] God said so and that settles it that's
[1:23:07] all of it if God said so God is able to
[1:23:11] keep his promise or he would never make
[1:23:14] it
[1:23:16] how good is that we ought to let that
[1:23:18] anchor down within our souls this
[1:23:20] evening and said God promised it and he
[1:23:23] has never made a promise that he cannot
[1:23:25] keep because he is a promise keeper he
[1:23:29] is a Waymaker he is a cancer deliverer
[1:23:33] server
[1:23:36] he is a family restorer
[1:23:39] he is a holy ghost filler
[1:23:42] he is a Salvation Giver
[1:23:46] and he's a friend he sticks closer than
[1:23:47] a brother
[1:23:49] that's my friend
[1:23:56] you can depend on
[1:24:04] get around me long enough I'll let you
[1:24:05] down
[1:24:07] I could almost say that that's thus
[1:24:09] saith the Lord
[1:24:14] it's true
[1:24:17] stuff my wife
[1:24:20] ask my kids
[1:24:24] I'll let you down as a friend
[1:24:27] I'll let you down as a brother
[1:24:30] I'll let my wife down and she'll let me
[1:24:32] down
[1:24:34] but there's one in Our Lives who will
[1:24:35] never let us down
[1:24:39] Jesus Christ
[1:24:42] a friend who sticks closer than any
[1:24:44] brother
[1:24:47] and when you've got your eyes fixed on
[1:24:50] him
[1:24:51] let me tell you something
[1:24:53] it doesn't matter what happens it
[1:24:56] doesn't matter if brother Stephen fails
[1:24:58] you because your eyes aren't fixed on
[1:25:01] brother Stephen
[1:25:04] Your Eyes Are Fixed On Him
[1:25:07] and so if brother Stephen was ever to
[1:25:09] fall you would never fall
[1:25:15] because your eyes are on him
[1:25:18] keep your eyes on Christ
[1:25:21] keep your friendship with Christ
[1:25:25] Hallelujah
[1:25:33] it's about brother branham's Ministry
[1:25:35] the Holy Spirit was always trying to get
[1:25:37] things across to us
[1:25:39] when we say that brother Branham said
[1:25:42] we could almost say the holy spirit says
[1:25:46] our God is trying to say something
[1:25:48] through his Prophet especially when he
[1:25:52] says it multiple times in multiple
[1:25:54] services and over and over again the
[1:25:56] Holy Spirit has a channel in which he's
[1:25:59] trying to show us something
[1:26:01] it's not just because brother Branham
[1:26:03] has wanted to repeat the same things at
[1:26:05] each church but the Holy Spirit has a
[1:26:07] channel
[1:26:08] that he's recording on tape that there
[1:26:11] will be a people who will catch that
[1:26:13] channel
[1:26:14] for a certain time
[1:26:16] in history
[1:26:19] that we might catch what the spirit is
[1:26:21] saying
[1:26:25] through the Holy Spirit I feel was was
[1:26:28] always trying to tell us of Who We Are
[1:26:35] brother Brandon would use the story he
[1:26:37] would say you ain't no chickens in the
[1:26:39] barnyard
[1:26:40] he would he said you're not supposed to
[1:26:42] be clucking with the chickens in the
[1:26:44] chicken coop
[1:26:46] just because you're an eagle that was
[1:26:48] birthed under a chicken or under a head
[1:26:50] that doesn't mean that that's who you
[1:26:53] are
[1:26:55] the reason you feel odd to the world is
[1:26:58] because you are hard to the world
[1:27:00] it's because you're an eagle
[1:27:03] he would use the natural type of a
[1:27:05] donkey he said a donkey he don't know
[1:27:08] who his mama is he don't know who his
[1:27:10] poppy is but a thoroughbred horse he
[1:27:13] knows who his mom he is he knows who his
[1:27:16] daddy is
[1:27:17] what was he trying to tell us through
[1:27:19] these little examples he's trying to say
[1:27:22] you are not of this world you are of
[1:27:24] something greater and something higher
[1:27:30] time and time again he would use the
[1:27:32] story of the slave
[1:27:36] and so this slave
[1:27:38] brother Branham said way back they would
[1:27:41] buy and sell slaves at like a used car
[1:27:44] lot
[1:27:46] and so there was this one slave and here
[1:27:49] he was he was he worked harder than
[1:27:52] everybody else
[1:27:53] brother Branham said they didn't have to
[1:27:55] whip him to work
[1:27:57] and somebody came along they said I want
[1:27:59] that one that's the one I want he said
[1:28:02] he's not for sale well what makes him
[1:28:05] different you'd feed them a little bit
[1:28:07] better food no he eats with everybody
[1:28:09] else does he get a better night's sleep
[1:28:12] does he sleep in a better quarters no he
[1:28:15] sleeps with the rest of the slaves well
[1:28:17] what's so different about this guy
[1:28:19] what's the difference in him why does he
[1:28:22] act different why does he talk different
[1:28:24] why does he carry himself differently
[1:28:29] he said well I I thought the same thing
[1:28:33] and he said I come to find out that he's
[1:28:35] the son of a king
[1:28:38] now this story when I when I got to
[1:28:40] thinking about this today I got to
[1:28:43] thinking he's the son of a king
[1:28:45] therefore he acted differently he talked
[1:28:48] differently because he knew that he came
[1:28:51] from Royal Blood he came from a Royal
[1:28:54] bloodline therefore he was different
[1:28:59] but the main difference in this guy was
[1:29:00] this
[1:29:01] that he had a revelation of who he was
[1:29:04] he had a revelation of who his family
[1:29:06] was he had a revelation of who his dad
[1:29:09] he was and because he knew who he was
[1:29:12] and where he came from he had a
[1:29:15] different way of thinking than everybody
[1:29:17] else
[1:29:20] what is the point in this little story
[1:29:24] we are different because we have a
[1:29:26] different father we are different
[1:29:28] because we have a royal blood that flows
[1:29:31] through our veins
[1:29:35] therefore our mindset is different when
[1:29:39] it comes to the word of God therefore
[1:29:41] our mindset is different when we are
[1:29:43] given bad news
[1:29:47] why because we know where we came from
[1:29:50] we know who our daddy is and if we are
[1:29:54] to ask our daddy for bread would he give
[1:29:56] us a stone
[1:29:58] therefore we have confidence and asking
[1:30:02] our Papa God for whatever need it is in
[1:30:06] our lives because we know we are Sons
[1:30:08] and Daughters of God
[1:30:10] you see the importance of knowing who
[1:30:12] you are you see the importance of
[1:30:14] knowing where you came from and where
[1:30:16] you're going back to because when you
[1:30:18] realize that now you have confidence in
[1:30:21] the word because he is the word
[1:30:27] but if you're not sure
[1:30:30] if you're not sure where you came from
[1:30:33] if you're not sure who you are
[1:30:36] if you're not sure of your identity in
[1:30:38] Christ you're not going to be sure about
[1:30:40] the promises that lay within this word
[1:30:44] if you're not sure about the promises
[1:30:47] that lays within this will
[1:30:50] if you don't know who you are
[1:30:52] and the will is read
[1:30:53] how do you know what's yours
[1:30:57] has got to be for somebody else because
[1:30:59] I didn't I didn't hear
[1:31:01] I didn't hear my name
[1:31:03] I I didn't hear it I heard somebody
[1:31:06] else's name but I I hope my name is in
[1:31:10] there
[1:31:13] hope ain't good enough
[1:31:17] but by faith
[1:31:19] we realize
[1:31:20] by a new birth experience
[1:31:22] I'm by your life being changed that
[1:31:24] something has happened and you know who
[1:31:26] you are and the more you listen to that
[1:31:29] eagle cry the more you realize where you
[1:31:31] came from and the more you realize I
[1:31:33] don't want to feed in the chicken coop
[1:31:35] no more but I want to Feast upon the
[1:31:37] fresh carcass of the word
[1:31:42] it all boils down to knowing your
[1:31:45] identity in Christ
[1:31:48] that when this will is read Because this
[1:31:51] is his will you realize that every
[1:31:54] Divine promise that is written within
[1:31:57] this book is mine as for my family
[1:32:01] that is for my loved ones therefore I'm
[1:32:05] going to accept it and I'm going to say
[1:32:07] Thank you Lord
[1:32:09] thank you
[1:32:11] many of you have ever been left
[1:32:13] something in a will
[1:32:15] raise your hands
[1:32:17] some people
[1:32:19] did you say thank you
[1:32:22] this is mine and I deserve it
[1:32:26] they worked their whole life for it
[1:32:29] but I'm getting their inheritance and
[1:32:31] it's mine I deserve it
[1:32:35] it's not how we acted
[1:32:38] say wow
[1:32:39] I didn't deserve this
[1:32:43] I didn't work for this house
[1:32:45] I didn't work for this money I didn't do
[1:32:48] anything for it I was just associated
[1:32:50] with the one that paid the price
[1:32:56] I was just associated with the one who
[1:32:59] paid the price
[1:33:01] and therefore by Grace they put my name
[1:33:04] on the will
[1:33:05] and because my name is on the will I
[1:33:08] accept it and I say thank you Lord
[1:33:11] so it is when I see something written
[1:33:14] within the will that pertains to me I
[1:33:17] say thank you Lord
[1:33:21] foreign
[1:33:23] thank you Lord
[1:33:26] the bride now is Awakening to who she
[1:33:29] really is
[1:33:31] she's realizing that she's bone of his
[1:33:33] bone and she's flesh of his flesh she is
[1:33:37] as part of a part of him and no one can
[1:33:40] take that away from us
[1:33:47] so what does it do
[1:33:49] when you realize who you are and where
[1:33:51] you came from and that you're a part of
[1:33:53] God and you came from Christ and you
[1:33:54] always were a part of him
[1:33:56] it puts an anchor in your heart
[1:33:59] and it makes you think that all things
[1:34:01] are possible
[1:34:03] to those who will believe so all things
[1:34:06] are possible to me because I am a
[1:34:09] believer and my life is testifying that
[1:34:12] I am a believer and therefore I'm
[1:34:14] believing
[1:34:17] because the promises are left to me
[1:34:24] when you know who you are there's no
[1:34:25] more being tossed to and fro
[1:34:28] but your faith is anchored in the word
[1:34:32] 1950 and who was God brother Brown says
[1:34:35] Joshua stopped the son is that true
[1:34:37] somebody said all things are possible
[1:34:39] with God nothing impossible but all
[1:34:41] things are possible to you also
[1:34:46] nothing impossible to them to believe
[1:34:48] all things are possible brought right
[1:34:50] down and made you if you just know who
[1:34:53] God was who is he
[1:34:56] he's my father
[1:34:59] that's who he is
[1:35:01] he's the one that birthed me he's the
[1:35:04] one that put me here for this for this
[1:35:06] period in this space of time
[1:35:10] he ain't something so far off that can't
[1:35:13] be touched
[1:35:16] but he's a God my father my friend
[1:35:20] he's my lover
[1:35:27] well I'm afraid that the church doesn't
[1:35:29] know their Authority
[1:35:31] I'm afraid that holy ghost-born men
[1:35:33] doesn't realize their Authority or the
[1:35:35] authority that God has permitted to his
[1:35:37] church
[1:35:39] I'll give unto you unto thee the kingdom
[1:35:42] the keys to the kingdom whatever you
[1:35:44] bind on Earth will be bound in heaven
[1:35:46] everybody said
[1:35:48] amen whatsoever you lose will be loosed
[1:35:52] I give you power over serpents
[1:35:54] don't let it die down over all kinds of
[1:35:57] diseases
[1:35:59] oh everything
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:03] nothing should so harm you
[1:36:06] listen to this
[1:36:07] exercise your faith
[1:36:09] he says Let it Loose let God have his
[1:36:13] way God will grant it to you
[1:36:18] don't let loose on your faith for
[1:36:21] salvation only but Let it Loose in the
[1:36:25] other areas of your life
[1:36:27] Let it Loose brother Branham said and
[1:36:30] God will grant it to you
[1:36:33] why because God honors faith
[1:36:38] how do I Let it Loose thank him before
[1:36:40] it comes to pass
[1:36:44] say well what if I don't feel like it
[1:36:46] well sometimes you don't feel like
[1:36:48] you're saved but you thank them that
[1:36:50] you're saved anyways
[1:36:54] you ain't lying when you tell them thank
[1:36:56] you for a promise
[1:36:57] thank you for a promise that you've
[1:36:59] already that you've already committed
[1:37:01] that you're going to fulfill thank you
[1:37:03] God for it
[1:37:05] he ain't lying
[1:37:09] you're speaking by faith
[1:37:14] before we can have faith for healing we
[1:37:17] first first must believe that his
[1:37:19] promises are true within the word
[1:37:22] just like you do for salvation
[1:37:25] Faith begins where the will of God is
[1:37:28] made known
[1:37:30] you heard about salvation and your faith
[1:37:32] began
[1:37:34] we're hearing about healing
[1:37:36] this is where our faith begins
[1:37:47] Faith must rest on the will of God Alone
[1:37:50] and not in our desires
[1:37:52] are in our wishes as the musicians come
[1:37:56] here are some scriptures in the will of
[1:37:58] God
[1:37:59] concerning healing we've just touched
[1:38:02] the surface of this stuff
[1:38:04] what do we do tonight we're building
[1:38:06] your faith
[1:38:07] we're building your faith and we're
[1:38:08] going to show you these
[1:38:10] four or five scriptures
[1:38:12] of what Jesus did while he was here on
[1:38:14] Earth
[1:38:15] and he's still here on Earth
[1:38:22] and because he is here his attributes
[1:38:25] are the same and his works are the same
[1:38:27] and they change not
[1:38:31] Mark 6 verse 13. and they cast out many
[1:38:35] devils and Anointed with oil many that
[1:38:37] were sick
[1:38:39] we got the scriptures Brothers
[1:38:42] and healed them Matthew 4 Mark 6 verse
[1:38:45] 13.
[1:38:47] and they cast out many devils and
[1:38:49] Anointed with oil many that were sick
[1:38:51] and healed them Matthew 4
[1:38:53] verse 24. and as Fame went throughout
[1:38:57] all of Syria
[1:39:00] and they brought on to him all sick
[1:39:02] people that were taken with diverse
[1:39:04] diseases and torments
[1:39:06] you can go ahead and start playing
[1:39:08] and those which were possessed with
[1:39:10] devils
[1:39:12] and those which were lunatic
[1:39:14] and those that had the palsy
[1:39:17] and he healed him
[1:39:20] I want to ask you something is there
[1:39:22] anything too difficult for gar
[1:39:24] whether it's palsy whether it's Devils
[1:39:26] whether it's lunatic
[1:39:29] whether it's diabetes you put whatever
[1:39:31] name you want there
[1:39:33] there is nothing
[1:39:35] that is too difficult
[1:39:36] for Papa God
[1:39:40] Matthew chapter 8 verse 16 when the even
[1:39:43] was come they brought on to him many
[1:39:45] that were possessed with devils
[1:39:48] he cast out the spirits with his word
[1:39:51] and healed all that were sick
[1:39:53] Psalms 107 verse 20 he sent his word
[1:39:57] and he healed him
[1:40:00] and he delivered them from their
[1:40:02] destructions
[1:40:04] Isaiah 53 verse 5 what a scripture
[1:40:09] there was a reason why he was wounded
[1:40:11] for our transgressions
[1:40:13] there was a reason why he was bruised
[1:40:15] for our iniquities
[1:40:18] why the chastisement of our peace was
[1:40:20] upon him and with his stripes
[1:40:24] we are healed
[1:40:27] there's no you will be healed there's no
[1:40:31] maybe there's a possibility
[1:40:34] but to the believer
[1:40:37] all things are possible
[1:40:39] and by his stripes we are already healed
[1:40:46] it's not something that we're looking
[1:40:48] off to in the future
[1:40:50] but it is something that is right now
[1:40:53] that is present amongst us because his
[1:40:56] word is an eternal word with eternal
[1:41:00] promises
[1:41:03] let's Stand Together
[1:41:09] why don't you go home this evening
[1:41:10] [Music]
[1:41:13] do a little study on healing
[1:41:16] look it up what does the Bible say
[1:41:19] what is promised to me in this hour of
[1:41:21] of healing within my body what has
[1:41:23] promised to me in this hour according to
[1:41:27] my to my friends and my family and my
[1:41:29] mom and my dad and my siblings what are
[1:41:31] my promises
[1:41:36] we just have faith
[1:41:39] in the promised word
[1:41:43] you know God made a covenant
[1:41:46] and he swore by himself because he could
[1:41:48] swear by no greater
[1:41:56] foreign he tried to have a covenant with
[1:41:59] man before
[1:42:02] if you'll do this I'll do this but it
[1:42:04] always failed
[1:42:06] but he came to a point in his I don't
[1:42:09] know on his great Plan of Redemption
[1:42:13] it is time
[1:42:15] it is time that I depend no more upon
[1:42:18] man
[1:42:20] but I'm going to swear by myself
[1:42:23] do you know that every promise that is
[1:42:25] written within this word is stamped with
[1:42:27] God's signature
[1:42:31] haha
[1:42:33] Hallelujah it is signed with red
[1:42:37] and it signed Papa God so on this
[1:42:40] checkbook
[1:42:42] brother Branham said you have a blank
[1:42:44] check in front of you with an un uh
[1:42:48] unlimited amount within the bank account
[1:42:51] and whatever it is you need to sign it
[1:42:55] on the checkbook it's already stamped
[1:42:57] it's already been paid it's written in
[1:43:00] in with red ink
[1:43:02] and it's stamped with God's signature
[1:43:04] all we have to do is realize what it is
[1:43:07] we're looking for
[1:43:09] what it is we need in our lives and say
[1:43:12] papa God
[1:43:13] you promised
[1:43:15] and your promises do not fail therefore
[1:43:18] I stand as a son and a daughter of the
[1:43:22] Living God not upon my desires not upon
[1:43:26] my wants but upon the promises of your
[1:43:28] word you made the Covenant
[1:43:34] his word says train me now
[1:43:37] saith the Lord
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:41] don't be scared
[1:43:44] don't be scared of rejection
[1:43:47] God will never reject you
[1:43:50] God will not reject a believer
[1:43:54] because there are as much a part of him
[1:43:57] as he is a part of himself
[1:44:03] so God could not slay Sarah
[1:44:07] because she was a part of Abraham
[1:44:09] [Music]
[1:44:10] God cannot slay the bride in this hour
[1:44:13] because she's born of his bone and flesh
[1:44:16] of his flesh
[1:44:18] therefore whatever we ask our husband
[1:44:23] oh
[1:44:24] oh King
[1:44:27] I'm So Unworthy to come before you
[1:44:31] but I didn't choose you
[1:44:34] chose me
[1:44:37] and because you chose me I know you'll
[1:44:39] never leave me
[1:44:41] and because you'll never leave me I
[1:44:43] believe that your promises are true and
[1:44:46] so here I stand
[1:44:52] [Music]
[1:44:54] he needs to sit down your own desires
[1:44:57] and your own wants your own I think it
[1:45:00] should happen this way of nonsense
[1:45:03] come to God with a clear conscience
[1:45:08] repent of your sins
[1:45:11] you want to get something from God
[1:45:14] approach
[1:45:16] [Music]
[1:45:17] repent of your sins make it right before
[1:45:21] because you know when you're doing that
[1:45:24] you know what God is doing it's his
[1:45:25] goodness towards you
[1:45:29] so now the goodness of God wasn't to do
[1:45:31] it leads us to repentance
[1:45:33] and now we're covered we have faith
[1:45:36] in the word of this day where brother
[1:45:37] Branham said the Clorox bleach of the
[1:45:40] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:45:43] it doesn't take away sins it doesn't
[1:45:44] just cover them
[1:45:46] vanished
[1:45:48] it's vanished
[1:45:50] it went back to where it was before it
[1:45:53] was something it never was
[1:45:55] you say well I did it in your flesh you
[1:45:58] did
[1:46:00] but you're not your flesh
