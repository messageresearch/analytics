[0:07] I just did it.
[0:14] Nothing.
[0:24] No, just YouTube.
[0:28] It says I'm live.
[0:52] [Music]
[1:02] Audio.
[1:04] Audio. Audio.
[1:17] You name
[1:36] He
[1:48] has shall
[1:52] [Music]
[2:01] be sweet
[2:03] [Music]
[2:08] This is on. Just come here. Is this you
[2:11] getting baptized? Praise the Lord. Let's
[2:13] just stand right here. And we would
[2:15] We're so proud of you guys for making
[2:18] this choice and and dedicating your life
[2:21] to God. And uh the Bible says, "Let the
[2:24] redeemed of the Lord say so." And so we
[2:27] would just like you to take, you know,
[2:29] one at a time of why you've made this
[2:32] decision and what God has done for you
[2:34] at this
[2:51] My name is Sharon and um before I used
[2:55] to not um believe that there was a God.
[2:58] Like I would come to church and stuff
[3:00] but like I would just be sitting there
[3:02] like rolling my eyes be like no none of
[3:03] this is real. um there's no such thing
[3:06] as dog and stuff like that. And then I
[3:09] was planning on coming to camp but then
[3:11] I I don't know I was like never mind I
[3:13] don't want to come but then I got
[3:15] sponsored like last minute I was like
[3:17] okay maybe this is like you know
[3:19] something telling me like you know you
[3:20] should go to camp and so when I came to
[3:23] camp I prayed before and I was like if
[3:25] there is actually a god maybe
[3:27] something's going to happen during this
[3:29] camp and then on the first day I was
[3:32] like sitting there and I was scared to
[3:35] like raise my hands and I was like you
[3:36] know what let me just raise my hands you
[3:38] Praise the Lord. And I like started
[3:40] tearing up. And ever since then, I was
[3:43] like, "Yeah, I want to give my life life
[3:45] to God." Hallelujah.
[3:49] [Applause]
[3:54] Um, my name is Gracia and um I' I've
[3:59] always known that that Jesus is always
[4:02] with me and even if the hardest
[4:07] moments, he's always been my
[4:09] [Music]
[4:15] comforter. And I've always had um well
[4:19] just like two weeks ago I had a feeling
[4:22] in my heart that I needed to get
[4:24] baptized and my parents told me to do
[4:26] it. And I wanted to wait till my dad did
[4:30] it. But a sister from church, she told
[4:33] me when I had a feeling in my heart I
[4:35] should do it and I shouldn't wait. And I
[4:39] already knew before I came here that I
[4:41] wanted to get baptized and receive the
[4:44] Holy Spirit. And um since Wednesday um
[4:48] Jesus just spoke to me and um through
[4:52] the preacher
[4:53] and and I just love being in his
[4:57] presence and being in the house of the
[5:00] Lord
[5:06] and and I just love him so much and I
[5:10] want to praise him every day of my life.
[5:13] Amen. And
[5:14] yes. Amen. Amen.
[5:20] Praise the Lord. And for those of you
[5:23] who would like to give uh you know a
[5:25] quick testimony after we do the baptisms
[5:28] if you would like to make your way up
[5:29] here. We would love to hear your
[5:31] testimony of what God has done for you
[5:33] at camp. And now as we as we go and and
[5:36] and and we do this, it's a commandment
[5:38] of the Lord that for us to repent and to
[5:42] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[5:44] for the remission of your sins and you
[5:46] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[5:48] Ghost. And so we see that the Holy Ghost
[5:51] is given after repentance and baptism.
[5:54] Amen. And so baptism does not save us.
[5:59] But baptism is an outward expression of
[6:03] an inward work of what God has done in
[6:06] your hearts. And so what you're saying
[6:08] to everybody here is you're saying I
[6:10] want to have it baptizes you into
[6:13] fellowship with the church. And the
[6:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost baptizes us
[6:19] into the body. Amen. So now you're
[6:22] saying, "Satan, I'm making my stand.
[6:25] I've repented of my sins and I'm moving
[6:28] forward with the commandments of God."
[6:29] And we're just so very pleased and proud
[6:32] of both of you.
[6:36] Amen. Sure. Let's let's all pray
[6:38] together.
[6:40] Father, Lord, we come before you here.
[6:45] We have two dear souls, Lord, that Lord,
[6:48] you thought of before the foundations of
[6:50] the world. And you ordained this time
[6:53] and this day for them, this moment,
[6:56] Father, that they would come to
[6:58] recognize you and recognize the finished
[7:01] work of Calvary and want to, Lord, take
[7:04] the next step in their faith. I pray,
[7:07] Father, bless them abundantly. Give them
[7:10] strength for the journey, Lord, and
[7:13] power, Lord, to fight the battles that
[7:15] lay ahead. We ask it for thy kingdom's
[7:17] glory in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[7:35] need a couple brothers after she's
[7:37] baptized to help her
[7:51] You're going to want to stay.
[8:01] [Applause]
[8:13] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[8:16] [Applause]
[8:18] [Music]
[8:48] [Applause]
[8:56] Praise the Lord.
[8:58] anybody
[8:59] else like to say, I want to take my
[9:03] stand. I've already done so.
[9:08] Amen. Amen. Those of you that have a
[9:11] testimony, brother Elijah, where are
[9:13] you? Come on up here, my brother.
[9:26] tell you about something the Lord has
[9:28] done in my life last year and a half. Uh
[9:32] for those of you who don't know about a
[9:34] year and a half ago I was diagnosed with
[9:36] cancer and I was completely healed up
[9:40] with
[9:40] cancer and I was I went through you know
[9:44] few times
[9:46] and first time it didn't work and second
[9:49] time he was doing better but you know in
[9:52] the
[9:52] end God and I'm not trying to throw off
[9:56] medicine I believe that stuff works but
[9:59] in the end I believe that he was God
[10:02] forgive me. And I just want to thank God
[10:04] for giving me a second chance because
[10:06] what I realiz is not a lot of people get
[10:09] a second chance and I was one of those
[10:12] people that were able to have a second
[10:14] chance and it's really just an honor to
[10:17] be able to stand here 100% cancer free.
[10:23] [Applause]
[10:29] I just like to thank brother Ron because
[10:31] I know him and his assembly were aware
[10:34] of the situation and prayed for him
[10:37] extensively.
[10:39] And also my friends, you know, there's
[10:41] verse in the Bible when those man
[10:43] couldn't get to Jesus. Yeah. They
[10:45] lowered him down to Jesus so he could.
[10:47] That's right. I'm just so thankful for
[10:50] them. But yeah, it's really an honor to
[10:53] be able to give this testimony. Praise
[10:56] God.
[11:02] That God is still alive and his word is
[11:05] still the same that by his stripes we
[11:07] are healed. Amen. There's a couple of
[11:09] sisters I believe that wanted to give a
[11:12] testimony. Just come forward now. There
[11:14] you go. Yeah. Don't waste no time. Just
[11:16] just walk up here and get in line. That
[11:18] way we can we can get through.
[11:20] Hello, I'm Flo Peterson and I wrote down
[11:24] this quick testimony that I wanted to
[11:25] share with you from my weekend at camp.
[11:29] Um, I would like to share this testimony
[11:32] with you all. I very enjoyed the
[11:34] ministry this weekend and it all went
[11:36] right in line with what I was going
[11:38] through. I came to camp with an
[11:40] expectation of a furtherance in my
[11:42] relationship with God and to know more
[11:44] of him and to just really experience the
[11:47] Holy Spirit. And I knew within myself
[11:50] that that was only possible if I let go
[11:52] and go allin because in the past I had
[11:56] gotten prayed for and I would just go
[11:59] back to what I had gone prayed for and
[12:01] it was just like a revival of death and
[12:04] I was just so done with it and I wanted
[12:07] to just give everything back to God and
[12:10] brother Matt and brother Steve
[12:12] encouraged me to dig out the things
[12:13] holding me back and across the river on
[12:16] Saturday night. I was so angry with the
[12:18] devil for holding me back from my
[12:20] blessing by tormenting my thoughts and
[12:22] doubt with doubt and
[12:25] uncertainty. Um that is when I felt led
[12:28] to ask for help and be prayed for. I
[12:31] have never experienced God's presence so
[12:33] strongly in my life. It's I it's so
[12:38] unexplainable. Half of this half of the
[12:40] time I don't even remember what
[12:42] happened. All I know I'll always
[12:45] remember is just saying thank you and
[12:47] thank you over and over and for healing
[12:49] me cuz I I knew exactly when I got
[12:53] healed and it's what and it's when I
[12:55] said I'm healed in Jesus name because in
[12:58] his name everything is possible and when
[13:00] I claimed my healing in Jesus's name I I
[13:04] knew exactly that's when that spirit
[13:05] left me and I and I just had a smile on
[13:08] my face because I was delivered and I
[13:11] have never experienced God's presence so
[13:13] strongly in my life. And as I was
[13:15] praying, I was claiming my healing and
[13:17] exposing the devil. When you expose the
[13:19] devil, he has nothing else. He has no he
[13:22] has no authority over you. And when you
[13:24] get mad at him, you expose him, he gets
[13:27] scared and he and he backs away. And I
[13:30] went all in and I gave everything I had
[13:32] to the Lord. I claimed my deliverance in
[13:34] Jesus' name. I felt the Holy Spirit wrap
[13:37] its arms around me and I felt Jesus
[13:39] deliver and deliver me because in that
[13:42] moment I remember that in the name of
[13:43] Jesus all things are possible. In that
[13:47] moment I went all in. I went back up to
[13:50] sing as a free daughter of God. To all
[13:52] the glory be to him. Thank you.
[13:55] [Applause]
[14:00] Um God bless you all. I just wanted to
[14:01] share short a short testimony. And this
[14:03] may be a simple testimony, but to me
[14:05] it's powerful and it's a gift from
[14:08] God. I believe he deserves all the glory
[14:11] because he has done something so special
[14:13] in my life during last night's
[14:15] service. And I'm here to testify and
[14:18] confess that God has changed me. And I
[14:21] can boldly claim that the devil doesn't
[14:23] have a hold on my life. And I'm here to
[14:25] give him all the glory and the praise.
[14:27] Amen.
[14:29] [Applause]
[14:34] Um, I felt like too serious. So, before
[14:37] camp, I got a hold of some really bad
[14:39] food poisoning and was really sick.
[14:42] Sicker than I've ever been. I didn't
[14:44] know if I would be able to go to camp. I
[14:45] was I lost like 9 lbs from being sick.
[14:49] And I was like, you know what? No. I'm
[14:51] not going to let the devil get in the
[14:52] way of me going and getting a good
[14:54] experience with the Lord. And I gave it
[14:57] to God and I said, take it away. And
[14:59] instantly the devil came and attacked
[15:01] because I claimed it. And he was like,
[15:03] "No, no, you're going to be sick. You
[15:05] can't go." And I kept on claiming it.
[15:07] And I felt God take it out of me. And I
[15:12] was I just knew that I would be okay.
[15:14] And I got to go to camp. And then the
[15:17] first service I came to, I feel I felt
[15:21] so strongly in my heart that he gave me
[15:23] desires in my heart. And I got blessed
[15:25] with the Holy Ghost. And that
[15:28] night the devil took his chance
[15:32] and tried to fill me with doubt and I
[15:35] kind of started
[15:36] waking and I just was like maybe you
[15:40] didn't get maybe maybe it was maybe it
[15:43] was just emotions and you didn't get
[15:46] anything and then I was talking to my
[15:50] friend Daniel and he was like the
[15:53] devil's going to attack you harder than
[15:56] when you when you get something and he's
[15:59] going to tell you you don't have it and
[16:02] I was like that's
[16:04] right I'm going to claim it and I
[16:06] claimed it and I believe 100% I'm b got
[16:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm a
[16:13] new changing person. I'm really thankful
[16:15] that God changed my life and was able to
[16:18] have this opportunity to come to this
[16:19] camp and I thank all of the ministers
[16:21] and everybody that preached. It felt
[16:24] like every single message was preached
[16:26] directly to me. It was for me and it
[16:29] just blessed my heart so much and all
[16:32] talked about everything I was going
[16:34] through and I was in hard I was having a
[16:36] hard time with and I just thank you all
[16:38] so much and thank everybody that put
[16:40] this camp together made this possible. Y
[16:43] truly amazing people.
[16:46] [Applause]
[16:52] Hi. Um, I just wanted to share how much
[16:54] coming to these youth camps have helped
[16:55] me and it just really changed my life.
[16:58] And I remember before I started coming
[17:00] to these camps, um, I dealt with this
[17:03] really bad depression and
[17:04] loneliness and I was just for like 8
[17:07] years. never really talked about it with
[17:09] anyone. And then in that I would just
[17:11] cry and cry
[17:14] and I would even suicidal thought
[17:17] sometimes pray that God would take
[17:23] me anymore.
[17:25] But I remember around that time um some
[17:29] of our friends told us about this
[17:31] camp and and I was just thinking this
[17:34] camp won't change me and I was wrong and
[17:38] I got baptized right after coming to
[17:40] this camp and I'm no longer bound by
[17:43] those thoughts the devil tried to put in
[17:45] my head and I always remember this song
[17:48] called um I'm going to say a victory cuz
[17:51] the battle belongs to you Lord and
[17:53] hearing this song just helped Thank you
[17:55] so much. And I'm just so blessed for all
[17:57] the friends I've made here. I truly
[17:59] believe they were God sent and just have
[18:01] been so encouraging to me and I'm so
[18:03] thankful for them. Amen.
[18:07] [Applause]
[18:11] Um I have grown up in this message all
[18:14] my life, but I never really understood I
[18:18] guess exactly what it was.
[18:23] Um
[18:25] um I have gone to secular schools,
[18:29] Christian schools, but they're all
[18:31] denominational and everything. And I
[18:33] would always get taught different
[18:34] things. So I would learn more and more
[18:38] about different worldviews like, oh,
[18:41] they believe this, they believe that.
[18:43] And I started thinking
[18:50] um and I started
[18:52] thinking what do I
[18:55] believe? I know
[19:01] that I just started thinking like
[19:06] um maybe I'm just going to take what
[19:13] I'm just going to take what my family
[19:14] believes. I'm not 100% sure, but I'm
[19:18] going to
[19:21] try. So,
[19:25] um I have
[19:28] been stuck in this loop, I guess. Um all
[19:32] I'm going to take from here, I like this
[19:36] whatever from this world view. Oh, I
[19:39] like this one.
[19:45] Man, I've been trying so hard to find
[19:48] the Lord
[19:50] recently. And I guess I could say that
[19:54] when it comes
[19:56] to someone asking me like, "Oh, well,
[19:58] what does this person believe? Like,
[20:00] what does this um world, what is this
[20:03] worldview? What is this?" and I can say
[20:06] stuff right off the bat. But then as
[20:08] soon as I get the question like, "Oh,
[20:10] well then what do you believe?" I was
[20:12] just stuck there. I didn't know. So I
[20:17] started really wanting to find the Lord
[20:20] recently. And when I came to these
[20:23] camps, um I've been going here for 3
[20:27] years, I believe. Every single time they
[20:30] would preach something and I'd be like,
[20:31] "Yes, that's the truth. That's the
[20:32] truth." But in my heart, I was just
[20:35] numb. I couldn't feel anything. I didn't
[20:39] see anything changing. And sometimes
[20:43] it seemed like it was getting
[20:48] worse. But um I think it was yesterday
[20:52] when we had the questions and answers
[20:55] because I'm the kind of person that
[20:58] likes to give answers. If you ask me a
[21:01] question, I will try my best to answer
[21:04] you the way that I know it's like right
[21:07] on. And I don't like asking questions
[21:11] all that much. So yesterday I felt
[21:15] compelled um to go and I asked you
[21:21] brothers. Um I asked way too many
[21:23] questions.
[21:28] Um, but I was really blessed on how they
[21:31] kept trying to answer me with their
[21:34] whole heart and kept pointing me back to
[21:37] scripture. Amen.
[21:39] And when they have been preaching these
[21:42] past days, like, oh, um, it's not you're
[21:46] not just going to have a feeling. It's
[21:48] not based off of emotions and
[21:50] everything. That really touched me
[21:53] because like I said before, I felt like
[21:55] I was just going numb. And during the
[21:59] service yesterday, this is going to
[22:01] sound really bad, but I did not feel
[22:04] anything. Like at first, I was feeling
[22:07] something beside me. I was feeling the
[22:10] presence of God. But then as the service
[22:12] went on, I just started going numb. Like
[22:15] I couldn't feel anything. And it felt
[22:18] like I was just stuck in time. like
[22:24] I and I was really struggling then and
[22:29] around the time I got to my cabin early,
[22:31] I wasn't sure what was going on. I was
[22:34] just upset at myself while I was
[22:38] saying everyone praise the Lord and
[22:41] everything
[22:42] and I just didn't feel anything. I was
[22:46] just on the
[22:49] sidelines. So, I got mad at myself. I
[22:53] was beating myself up for last
[22:57] night. I was up till like 2 something in
[23:01] the morning. I'm just like, why God? Why
[23:03] can't I
[23:05] feel why can't I feel your presence
[23:08] around me? Everyone
[23:10] here has a testimony and nobody here is
[23:13] praising the Lord and I'm just here not
[23:15] feeling anything at
[23:17] all. But that's when I kept getting
[23:21] reminded it's not just the feeling. It's
[23:24] not just the
[23:26] emotion. And the devil was putting my
[23:29] thoughts like, "Oh, you didn't feel
[23:31] anything. Everyone
[23:33] was praising the Lord. They were crying.
[23:36] They were at the altar. Some of them
[23:38] were just singing their heart out to
[23:40] God. And while we weren't doing
[23:43] anything, you were quiet. You were
[23:44] listening. That was just it. You
[23:46] couldn't feel
[23:49] anything. So this is your fault. You're
[23:53] not Hey, you're not worth anything.
[23:57] And when I started getting reminded
[24:00] about what the brother was saying
[24:02] before,
[24:03] um, that if you have those thoughts and
[24:08] everything, that's just the devil trying
[24:09] to get at you. The devil's trying to get
[24:11] at you. The devil's trying to make you
[24:16] disbelieve. So this morning, I was
[24:19] really searching for something. I still
[24:22] hadn't felt anything, I guess. And Um,
[24:26] by the endish of the service, I felt
[24:30] something right beside me just say,
[24:33] "It's going to be okay. You know me. You
[24:36] know me, my daughter. I know you, too.
[24:40] It's going to be okay. If you want to,
[24:43] come pray to me. You haven't been
[24:46] speaking to me in a long time. Come pray
[24:49] to me, my child. Come talk to me." and
[24:52] the service today.
[24:55] I it was really a blessing. Um, God
[24:58] bless you.
[25:05] Um, so I think it was like around last
[25:08] year when I decided that I wanted to
[25:10] like really truly take my relationship
[25:13] with the Lord Jesus Christ seriously. Um
[25:16] but the thing is that I was like still
[25:18] in school and um I was also working at
[25:21] the same time and so honestly with
[25:23] school and being at work I didn't I
[25:26] couldn't come to church as often as I
[25:28] wanted to. But then I decided cuz it
[25:31] just it got to a point where I was like
[25:33] kind of sick and tired of it. I was like
[25:35] I don't want this any longer. I kind of
[25:37] just really want to pursue the Lord. So,
[25:39] I decided I was going to graduate early
[25:41] and I was going to quit my job and stuff
[25:44] like that so that I could like find
[25:46] something else that wouldn't have me
[25:47] working on Sundays and stuff. So, I did
[25:51] do that and then in and that was like
[25:54] around December, right? And so, in
[25:55] January,
[25:57] um it just felt like life came crashing
[26:00] down. I honestly thought that like it
[26:02] was going to be all better, you know,
[26:04] cuz I was going to spend all this time
[26:06] with Jesus and all this, but life just
[26:09] like it just came crashing down. I got
[26:12] like some really horrible news at the
[26:14] hospital and so like I had been dealing
[26:16] with a couple of um you know physical
[26:18] health issues and then there was also
[26:20] like mental health issues and just like
[26:23] all these things and um also it was kind
[26:26] of hard to like find a job that wouldn't
[26:29] um what's it called you
[26:31] know let me work on Sundays and stuff
[26:34] and that was like my main thing I told
[26:36] myself that I don't care if I'm
[26:39] desperate for money or whatever the
[26:40] Lord's going to provide. side, but I
[26:42] need to not work on Sundays. And um but
[26:47] yeah, so like I had been kind of
[26:49] struggling with money and stuff and then
[26:51] I was like, you know what? Like you
[26:52] know, camp was coming up and I was like,
[26:55] I'm just going to use my tax refund for
[26:57] camp, but what's it called? It didn't go
[27:01] through and what's it called? Cuz I
[27:02] needed to do like a verification. So I
[27:05] was like, I don't know what I'm going to
[27:06] do, you know? I was like um very like
[27:09] disheartened. And then
[27:12] um when I was at church and randomly I
[27:15] had a conversation with the brother and
[27:16] stuff and then he had like offered me a
[27:18] job and stuff and um so for like the two
[27:22] weeks I was working with him like it was
[27:24] enough to cover for camp but other
[27:28] issues started arising, right? And so I
[27:31] had to kind of decide what I was going
[27:32] to use my money for. And then I had told
[27:34] myself like I had to remind myself the
[27:36] money that I had worked hard for was for
[27:40] camp. So I was going to use that and
[27:41] then the Lord was going to provide in
[27:43] all the other areas. And praise the Lord
[27:45] that he did. But it was weird because
[27:48] like I was I don't know. I was just
[27:51] really um down in the dumps. Come to
[27:54] your testimony. Okay. Sure. Okay. Um but
[27:58] yeah, so I was like really down in the
[27:59] dumps and um
[28:03] uh what's it called? I just I remember I
[28:06] was just like talking to the Lord cuz it
[28:08] felt like he wanted me to go deeper but
[28:11] like I didn't know exactly what he meant
[28:13] by that. And then come here to camp. um
[28:18] the brother, you know, he was talking
[28:19] about like, you know, you standing in
[28:22] the, you know, the river and stuff and
[28:24] then you kind of have to decide for
[28:25] yourself whether you're going to like,
[28:28] you know, go forward or you're just
[28:29] going to like stand there and stuff. And
[28:32] then I decided that I was just going to
[28:34] go deeper and stuff. And then honestly,
[28:36] with the help of my friends Gi and
[28:38] Gracia and uh Lisa, um they've been such
[28:43] a testimony in my life and stuff. Oh,
[28:46] yeah.
[28:53] Hi, I'm Miles. Um, some of y'all know
[28:55] me.
[28:57] I've been to like camps before and I
[29:00] feel like I got in the victory, you
[29:02] know, and
[29:08] um I just go back and do the same things
[29:10] over and over
[29:13] and I beat myself up, you know, and I
[29:18] just what brother Matthew was talking
[29:22] about just um like you will make
[29:26] mistakes. It's like you just got to get
[29:28] back up, you know? Mhm. And I realize
[29:32] that now
[29:34] and you just fil refilled me with the
[29:37] Holy Ghost and um just really felt
[29:42] great. On Friday night, I went up for
[29:45] prayer and I got down on the altar and
[29:48] it was just amazing.
[29:51] And Saturday night
[29:53] um Saturday night
[29:55] um I was like I got what I came for and
[29:59] I just like not like turned off my ears
[30:02] but like I was just like wasn't looking
[30:05] for anything else you know and
[30:08] um when you called us up on the stage I
[30:12] um I liked your testimony. Um, I just I
[30:16] saw Libby in the back and I really just
[30:18] had rooting for her and I saw we were
[30:21] praying with brother Matthew and Grace
[30:24] was
[30:24] too and I just started to pray for them
[30:28] and I just broke down
[30:30] cry. I'm sorry.
[30:33] Um, and it's just you can just feel the
[30:37] presence.
[30:39] And I just thank all of like the helpers
[30:42] and all the ministers. Thank you for
[30:45] your sacrifice and all that.
[30:53] Hi. Um, for those who don't know, I'm
[30:55] Sophia.
[30:56] Um, I grew up in a messaged like
[30:59] household. Um, and around 20 my parents
[31:02] got divorced and um my mom stopped
[31:06] coming to church and a lot of my family
[31:08] like my brother
[31:09] started drifting back away um and I
[31:14] thought that like that wouldn't really
[31:15] stop me from like um like reverting to
[31:18] God but um I had to live with my dad for
[31:22] a couple years um and my new stepmom
[31:26] wasn't really like good influencing
[31:28] um and I went through a lot
[31:32] I was only
[31:35] like I was like emotionally, physically
[31:37] abused by like my dad. Um and I kind of
[31:42] felt like why would that happen to like
[31:43] a daughter of God, but
[31:47] um I was kind of figuring out like why
[31:49] would that happen to a daughter of God?
[31:51] And maybe I was like maybe I'm not
[31:52] connected as well to God as I am or like
[31:55] as I should be cuz I was growing up like
[31:58] um in a message household. So, I started
[32:00] doubting myself a lot and I started
[32:02] doing really bad things that I really
[32:05] regret. And I was thinking if I came to
[32:07] church, I'm not like like I just sit
[32:10] there and I feel like I'm like
[32:14] um I'm like raising my hand and singing
[32:17] and praying and I'm not doing like all I
[32:18] can for God. And when I got baptized
[32:22] um it was like a really bad experience
[32:24] because my my dad was there so it didn't
[32:27] make it better. But after that I felt
[32:29] like why did I get baptized like so many
[32:31] of the same things. Um so but
[32:35] um last last night for service I felt um
[32:40] something in my heart and I was like the
[32:42] devil's like holding me back from a lot
[32:44] of the things that I should have hold me
[32:46] back from a lot of things like praising
[32:48] the Lord and I felt like why is he
[32:50] holding me down with these burdens that
[32:51] have happened years ago cuz I've been
[32:53] having a lot of night tears.
[33:00] nightmares and night terrors um and like
[33:02] voices in my head and still telling me
[33:04] like like reminding me of the things
[33:06] that have happened and I'm saying I
[33:08] should forget those things because I
[33:09] should revert to God and God
[33:11] knows God knows what like would be best
[33:13] for me and it's best to move on cuz it's
[33:16] not happening anymore and I'm not seeing
[33:18] it
[33:19] anymore and I'm trying to surround
[33:21] myself with good
[33:23] people and I'm just trying to focus like
[33:26] by myself trying to find my own way
[33:27] because I don't really have the best
[33:28] support system right
[33:30] now. But um coming to camp was really
[33:33] weird. Um I feel like this year I've
[33:35] really been like um making really good
[33:37] friends and good connections and really
[33:39] being closer to God and um talking to my
[33:42] pastor. Talking to my pastor really
[33:44] helped me. And um I feel like I'm trying
[33:46] to find my own way. And last night I
[33:48] really um felt a connection to God and I
[33:50] feel like
[33:51] I'm I'm going to be close to him from
[33:53] now on.
[33:54] Hallelujah. Help me last night, sir.
[33:57] Amen.
[34:04] [Music]
[34:06] Hello. My name
[34:07] is My name is Isaac. Most of you
[34:09] probably don't know me. I'm from Ohio.
[34:11] But, uh,
[34:13] so I've been going to college for two
[34:16] years now. And, uh, last year I really
[34:18] felt myself,
[34:21] uh, farther away from God. Felt like
[34:24] The devil was talking to me. He's
[34:26] telling me stuff like, "You're you're
[34:29] still a reformed Christian. You're not
[34:30] meant to be anywhere near God. You're
[34:33] you're just going to go to hell and
[34:36] you're not meant to be with the others."
[34:38] And I sort of let that control my life
[34:41] for a long time. And
[34:44] then soon
[34:46] as when uh I got out for summer break, I
[34:49] started going back to my original church
[34:52] because During the during college, I I
[34:55] let the control me was just watching
[34:58] stream. I was streaming a bunch of
[35:00] services. I wasn't going to church as
[35:01] much as I should have. I was starting to
[35:03] let really control my life. And then
[35:05] when I got back to when I got back home
[35:09] and started going with my family, I
[35:10] really felt I really felt the Lord start
[35:13] pulling back on my heart. And I felt
[35:16] that I felt like I really needed to get
[35:19] back with the Lord and do more for him.
[35:21] So, I started trying to make up my own
[35:24] plan of how I was going to turn my life
[35:26] around and I was going to become this
[35:29] really a strong and fit Christian and do
[35:32] everything right. And I kept trying and
[35:35] I kept failing and failing and then I
[35:40] um the past few and then the past few
[35:42] weeks I started to realize that that I'm
[35:45] not doing this right. my preacher
[35:46] started to preach about it and
[35:49] then and then we started coming here and
[35:51] the services have during the first
[35:54] service on Wednesday night that I went
[35:56] to
[35:57] uh the church. I forget the name of the
[36:00] church. But um
[36:03] fellowship, eating like fellowship, I
[36:05] mean when he started talking about not
[36:08] just being a servant and trying to
[36:11] actually following the Lord, that really
[36:13] just touched my heart and it made me
[36:16] want to just commit more and more and
[36:18] start praying more for him. And then as
[36:20] we came here, I I thought that I don't
[36:25] know if I'm going to really get to draw
[36:27] closer to him here. I mean, there's a
[36:29] lot of people here I don't know. And
[36:32] everybody everybody's off doing their
[36:34] own thing. I'm just alone. And the devil
[36:36] kept making me doubt like, you're not
[36:38] going to get anything out of this.
[36:39] You're going to go back and it's going
[36:41] to be the same way. And then when we had
[36:43] the then when we had the service with
[36:46] brother Matthew McGiri, he really God
[36:48] really spoke through him and touched my
[36:50] heart and it made me want to just keep
[36:52] drawing closer and closer. made me
[36:54] realize all these doubts that I had and
[36:56] all the things that I've let the devil
[36:59] manipulate me into thinking and all the
[37:01] things that I've just not been doing
[37:04] right and it made me want to keep
[37:06] drawing closer to the Lord. And I got
[37:08] down at the altar and I I prayed that
[37:11] the Lord would just take control of my
[37:13] life and that I'd stop trying to make my
[37:16] own plan and do stuff my own way and
[37:18] that he would take full control of my
[37:20] life so that I could finally overcome
[37:23] the devil and all the things that he's
[37:25] done for me. that I started to realize
[37:28] that the Lord had really touched me as I
[37:31] kept going through these services and
[37:32] realized more and more that I was able
[37:34] to write down because when I was at
[37:36] home, I would just write down like
[37:38] occasionally a couple things from the
[37:40] service and wasn't paying too much
[37:42] attention. Now, when I came here, I was
[37:44] trying to write down everything. It
[37:45] really felt like the Lord was trying to
[37:47] write out exactly what I needed to do.
[37:50] Every single thing the preacher said was
[37:52] really touching my
[37:54] heart. And every single time, every
[37:57] single service, I felt like I was the
[37:59] double in. And then I'd come to the
[38:01] service and the preacher would just
[38:02] preach about what I did wrong and what I
[38:05] need to do to be better. I need to pray
[38:07] more. I need to really listen to more
[38:10] tapes. I need to read the Bible more and
[38:11] draw closer to the word and to the Lord.
[38:15] And I want to thank the brothers here.
[38:17] And I want to thank God especially for
[38:20] just staying with me throughout all this
[38:21] time and not giving up on me. And
[38:25] And especially when the preacher said
[38:26] that God still loves you. It was the
[38:29] Saturday morning service that really
[38:31] just touched my heart. And I that was
[38:33] one of the first times I really felt
[38:35] emotional in church. It just really felt
[38:38] like God was trying to tell me that I
[38:41] that he still loves me and that he
[38:43] really wants me to worship and draw
[38:46] closer to him. And I want to thank him.
[38:48] And I want to thank all the wonderful
[38:50] pastors here. It was such a gift from
[38:52] God to let me to preach to me. Thank you
[38:57] [Applause]
[39:03] all.
[39:06] Hello. My name is AA and my testimony
[39:09] starts a few years back when diagnosed
[39:12] with
[39:14] um fat foot syndrome. It's um when the
[39:18] foot has no arc and
[39:21] does makes that I'm not able to
[39:25] take be on my feet for a long period of
[39:28] time standing up for even just for a few
[39:31] minutes. My feet start to hurt really
[39:36] bad. I asked
[39:38] brother a few years back if he had pray
[39:40] for me.
[39:44] We did. And then I got better. And then
[39:48] a few months after that, I I started the
[39:50] pain started coming back. And
[39:53] um when I came to this camp, I asked
[39:56] brother to pray for me again on Friday.
[40:01] And Saturday, we had all the events and
[40:04] everything.
[40:09] We went like I I went to the volleyball
[40:11] the sand volleyball and normally I
[40:14] wouldn't be able to play
[40:16] uh due to the to my diagnosis. And um I
[40:22] I said I'll just uh play for a few
[40:24] minutes and see if my feet um start to
[40:28] hurt and I did
[40:30] and it started to hurt really bad and
[40:35] some some sisters wanted me to continue
[40:37] playing because they were going to start
[40:38] to make teams. But I just I couldn't
[40:40] stand for much longer. I needed to find
[40:43] a place to sit down until I uh and the
[40:46] devil just kept going to attack me
[40:48] saying, "See, you're not really healed.
[40:50] You know, you got prayed for multiple
[40:52] times and you haven't been healed yet."
[40:54] But then I just like started
[40:58] um believing those thoughts until
[41:01] another thought came to me saying but uh
[41:04] like where's your faith? You can pray
[41:07] for it twice and you you get like better
[41:11] but then you start dallying where's your
[41:14] faith? So I went back to the silence
[41:16] volleyball and um they had already made
[41:19] teams and
[41:21] um I After a lot of the games had been
[41:25] played, I got put on a team and I they I
[41:29] played for a few more minutes and then
[41:31] it was time for the choir
[41:34] and in the choir uh I had to stand for a
[41:39] long period of time and I asked um Joe
[41:43] love all if I could lean on him and
[41:46] being the best friend he is.
[41:48] I could and I was able to rest for for a
[41:53] while while I was practicing to the
[41:54] choir. And then um
[41:59] uh Saturday evening when we were just
[42:01] singing um I
[42:06] was hoping that my feet wouldn't start
[42:08] hurting and I was able to like go
[42:12] through the whole song without any
[42:15] problems with my feet. And even right
[42:18] now I was standing over there and I have
[42:20] I I have no pain. God has healed up.
[42:23] Hallelujah. Thank the Lord for it. Thank
[42:26] you, Lord.
[42:30] Praise the Lord. This will be our last
[42:32] two here. Thank you.
[42:36] Hello, my name's Hannah. Um, I've been
[42:40] going through a lot of stuff in my life
[42:42] that been affecting me a lot and making
[42:45] me look God. Um, I've been suffering
[42:48] from suicidal thoughts and more. I've
[42:51] been getting prayed for a lot and
[42:53] brother Ron has prayed for me. I've been
[42:56] getting help. It's just really hard for
[42:58] me to do it. I always have doubts that
[43:01] God's not working on me and that I just
[43:05] shouldn't be here.
[43:09] Um yesterday in the service, it really
[43:13] touched me and it meant a lot to me that
[43:16] people here cared for me, especially my
[43:18] friends and um sister Caitlyn. She was a
[43:21] big help. Um
[43:24] um I just cried to the Lord yesterday
[43:27] and sang my heart out to him and I just
[43:30] felt a presence over me with him just
[43:33] saying it's okay and I'm here for you.
[43:36] Bless you.
[43:38] [Applause]
[43:41] You belong here. This is family. That's
[43:43] right.
[43:46] I didn't want to be the last
[43:48] one.
[43:50] Um I just want to thank the ministers,
[43:53] brother Matt, Brother Steve, for just
[43:55] letting them be used of the Lord and for
[43:58] making the spirit so welcome for us.
[44:02] Um, I've been to a lot of services like
[44:05] this over my
[44:07] life where I pray and I cry and I go to
[44:10] the altar and I believe I'm delivered
[44:15] and I believe that all the things that I
[44:18] go through are gone and a week later I'm
[44:21] doing the same things, thinking the same
[44:23] things and bitterness comes back and
[44:26] unhappiness comes back and doubt and
[44:31] Brother Master, you're talking
[44:33] about looking at that root
[44:36] [Music]
[44:37] issue about what's really the problem of
[44:41] of what you're dealing with. And usually
[44:43] when I pray about these things, I just
[44:45] pray about like recent events or or
[44:48] things that come to mind. And I just
[44:50] started digging up stuff that I I hadn't
[44:53] even realized I've been harping for like
[44:55] nine years.
[45:01] I felt his presence so strong last night
[45:03] and I've such an encouragement. I've all
[45:08] my life I've I've felt so lonely and the
[45:11] devil's gotten in my head telling me
[45:13] that there's no one there's no friends.
[45:15] There's no one to to comfort me. And
[45:18] when I go up there and I pray and I have
[45:21] all these brothers praying there with
[45:23] me, combining their faith is just it
[45:26] confirms to me that I'm not alone. I
[45:29] have so many friends here that I love.
[45:32] Elijah and Joe, Nathaniel,
[45:36] Jonah, that that dude right there, I
[45:38] don't know your name, but held my full
[45:40] body weight on Friday night. You're a
[45:42] legend,
[45:44] dude. I'm so thankful for God. I I know
[45:48] I'll go back tomorrow to work and the
[45:50] rest this week
[45:51] and the devil's going to hit me hard
[45:54] with the same trials, but I can face
[45:56] them with a new found confidence that
[45:58] maybe even if I fail, I there's going to
[46:01] be one of these days where I'm going to
[46:02] get up and say, "Not this
[46:04] time." Because I believe there is a new
[46:07] nature change. And I'm just hoping for
[46:09] the Lord for that.
[46:14] Praise the Lord. There's no testimony
[46:16] without a test. Amen. So, over here at
[46:19] the this gazebo is lost and found. If
[46:22] you guys have a pillow missing or
[46:25] whatever missing, that's where you're
[46:26] going to find it. And brother Israel has
[46:29] something to say. Achievement.
