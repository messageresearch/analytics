pray Lord are with Thanksgiving Lo fat tonight may you Quicken us and lead us along the way as we ask and pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen may God bless you tonight it is a privilege once again to be in the house of the Lord with all the federal delay we're going to take the Bible be able to read the word we're still going to read from where we read the last time in the book of Luke I believe foreign Luke chapter 22 verse 24 to 30. and there was also a Strife among them which of them should be accounted uh the greatest and he said unto them the kings of the Gentiles exercised lordship over them and this and they that exercise Authority upon them are called benefactors but ye shall not be so but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is Chief as he that Dove serve for weather is greater he that seedeth admit or he that a service is not he does it have admit but I am among you as he that serveth ye I tell you which have continued with me in my in my Temptation and I'll appoint you a point unto you a kingdom as my father have appointed unto me that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel amen may God bless you you may be seated uh once again I would like to thank the pastor who is not around or for the trust years are loaded unto me given me to be able to share the word tonight as uh we'll be continuing on the subject I started last time they thought the pouring of the Gentile nations in the end times I Believe by God's grace so it's uh it has a lot of more stuff going with it but I will just take my time as uh time goes by and as I we have recordings and taking notes and stuff to be able to review them time to time as the Lord leads you to uh because uh we'll get to some times that are very where I'm really headed to by God's grace but it is important for us to lay down uh all the aspect that will when everything will bridge in the near future but God's Grace will be able to see the point why the pattern of the Gentiles in the end times uh we saw last time uh we went to into Genesis 11 uh where we saw Nimrod um starting out uh his mind he had three things that he was uh following in his mind that he wanted to build a strong nation which he did he wanted to propagate his own religion which he did which will shall go a little bit deeper into night and he wanted to make a name for himself for which he also did I touched a little bit on that on the conclusion last time but but God's grace uh it's I think it's very important to go a little bit take spread it in a little bit in so that we can be able to grasp it so that it doesn't sound as a harsh sermon but instead the God is uh following a purpose here uh we see that by God's grace uh uh the word has it comes forth Gods as a program uh with God's program it doesn't change regardless of where any Minister can take it at the end of the day uh we have received a profit and this Prophet has brought us a message bringing out what got ahead in the back part of his mind and what got in the back part of his mind is given to diminish the prophet and the prophet hands it to the minister the minister to the people so the pattern Remains the Same so there's no two three four messages if uh it have happens that it come across as like you know it doesn't is not as clear you just take the pattern as the program says shows it unto us in the seven Church ages it says that you know out of the ages comes the sales out of the sales the trumpets or the trumpets the veils until all the Revelation is open before our wandering eyes and we are edified to say four years ago glorious appearing so when you see the entire thing and it's hit where it goes into the edges it says I want you to remember these things that we want to see the two spirits in the framework of the church so then you can see like you know though it gives us the whole program of God God wanted to restore even you wanted to have a preeminence upon his people and wanted to restore the men to the position that he had but then over time we see that you know this is a space of almost two thousand two thousand years along these two thousand years time goes by event takes place but then the purpose of a prophet is now to take all those events and give you a perspective because the world has perspective of what it is that people can call themselves Democrat and some will call themselves uh Republican conservatives and all these things with basically what they're doing they're taking the very same information that we have at our at our hand and they give it a perception they said they'll tell you that no we have to look at it this way then you have the denomination so they also take the same information they take the same Bible and they look at it through a certain perspective but then we believe by faith you know there's no uh factual intellectual fact whereby we can stand and say like you know the prophet is the prophet of of Malacca fall but by faith and by Revelation because understand like you know it can be a hard statement but we know that anybody who has knowledge can take the book and can say like you know oh William pranam is not a guy you know here Malachi 4 we see uh one part here but then when it comes he divides Malachi 4 into two parts it tells you like you know Malachi 3 has fulfilled the first part then you you know it just comes open to whom it is given but then so the rest of them is like no that's not true you cannot divide a word like that but it's only given to a certain people that's why I like Hero by God's grace those elements are now given to us to be able to access the word so now when the word is given to us is not to be given in in a historical point where we stand and we look at the word and we say like you know oh this has already passed that you know in the time of uh and by Revelation and then we're able to understand ourselves because William Branham growing up as a Young Man couldn't understand his own life he wanted to uh be a ranger out they wanted to do what he thought he would just the same as all of us wanted to be whatever we wanted to be but then since the Lord has has a hold Upon Our Lives then it leads us in a certain manner for us to come to this perfect realization so we understand like in um the the framework of the church we have two spirits and these two Spirits have their own objectives and now at times now for those two those two spirit to be able to get to where they want to get they didn't have to you they have to have vessels those vessels are you and I in a way or another born from north south east and west the devil is interested in you and God is also interested in you and the same way in the same manner the Lord now comes to us to give us the information to understand the benefit of why should you be embracing this program because also as we saw that you know Nimrod has three purpose in what he's doing he wants to have a people that he wants to uh to rule upon and it goes about by Conquering the land he goes and he divides the people up depending on either the white black and yellow mixed and whatever you want to call it because once upon a time people of the earth lived under Jehovah God not uh you know some Mary and some Pope and some president and out there but they lived under his leadership when they lived under his leadership they didn't know that you know this only the only thing they knew that this is my brother this is my sister but then when Nimrod came then we came to realize that you know we have our left hand we have our right hand what is that education it brought education about to start now dividing people to stand like you know hey you people deserve this and they don't deserve that and you people shouldn't mix with this and you know people this are not smart and these are way smarter you belong for this and all that so that's how nimrode sought to up fulfilled that great vision of his or that he had nevertheless the Lord comes and start providing these informations and when Nimrod came about and started dividing the land and then introduced culture as we saw last time when he introduced introduced culture then people were separated into tribes into country into uh continents and into you know all these things that we want but then it didn't stop there because he also wanted to bring the people to worship Him and in order to be worshiped he had to do if to do it he had to know exactly how to proceed and he started by taking the people away one step at a time away from the worship of God so then it transformed and is going to use all kind of means possible in order for him to bring the people to worship Him and we see that uh when the people were worshiping the Jehovah God they couldn't see him they didn't see him because remember this is after the fall that you know the they didn't know uh they were cast out from the presence of God and the Lord said okay this is it you've sinned you didn't listen to what I told you now you're going to be that comes a time where people had to receive now another form of worship and by receiving that form of worship the thought that it looked so nice and it looks so natural and they started following what the devil was giving them one step at a time just like a brother who bats Elijah sister he doesn't box the light like you know on the click overnight no you know it takes stages you know today he was sitting on the first few then tomorrow is in the middle and then he's on the back and then it doesn't come to church anymore you know so it's all those stages that Nimrod does also to bring uh his religion about because when you don't you lose interest in the word of God it means like the The Emptiness has to be filled with something else so therefore the uh Nimrod knew that okay God we don't see him because if we have to deal with anybody we have to see him I have to see my brother like you know brother we're going to meet I know that when I go I have to see somebody but then if the sun comes I don't know I'm looking for your father not you because there's direct distinct there but then nimrody knew that and said well it doesn't exist we don't see him do you talk to him there were no relationship they were just they didn't have any knowledge but then with education the devil now Nimrod came about and started giving people information he started with the religion on the first stage he said he replaced uh the head of an old medicine symbolizing God the father he said well if you say like there's a God that means like you know he's got the father you don't see him he's a spirit we agree upon that everybody will say yeah you don't see God nobody can sin God there are scriptures about it and then uh at a certain point he started it kept them it took them a little bit further and said okay instead of having just God the Father let's put him uh in a circle in which the mystery signify the seed which turned to be the sun okay the father you don't see the father let us deal with the Sun how do we represent the sun we put him just as a circle with a little symbol there it didn't seem very offensive at the beginning but then he was driving them first away until then he'll be able to be worshiped then afterward it took them a little bit further and then represented that since you don't see the father he's a spirit now we have a son which is a seed let us give you something that is more or something that you can see or something that you can touch then you represented it with the wings and tell of a dove you go in all the churches that's what it is represented as when you look at everywhere we know like you know the Catholic church and all the denominations when we want to speak about purity and all these things straight we go to the dove why because the Nimrod Saturday is somewhere because many times we do all kinds of things in our lives we might not understand exactly why do we why we do what we do but it was necessary for you for him to uh for him to do that in order to to bring the things about then Burnham says in the program in church ages he said here was the doctrine of the Father Son and Holy Ghost three persons in the godhead a veritable a veritable Trinity you can see the same thing in Rome now let me ask um once again it is not strange that the devil and his worshipers actually had more truth revealed than the father of Faith Abraham and his and his descendant it is not strange that the worshipers have Satan knew more about God than the children of God of of God what is it doing is bringing the people the information he's telling them like you know hey whatever you know you can show me there's a God out there but then let me take you a little bit further let me explain it to you because uh in the history it was called the Nimrod was called the the revealer of the word he took himself like you know that uh that title they say like you know I'm going to reveal to you what you do not know it is the same pattern as it was in the Garden of Eden it came to Eve and telling her I will teach you what you don't know because you have to become God as it is today like you know they can tell a man a grown man went to school and with all his knowledge you can be a dog you can be a woman when you're a man you can be a man when you're a woman so the very same teaching that he started it never changes way he's only changing his forms he's only changing his uh his uh appearance but he is still using the very same techniques because he wants to be worshiped and what does he say he says he sees like well since God the father that you worship so much doesn't talk to you we don't have a proof of it what do we do then it's better for we to look at him as ease because any son who talks to his father and the father doesn't answer back eventually is going to start ignoring the father he's going to find where the solution is probably his friends if he can take all the necessary advice from the father is going to deal with the friends or deal with uh the the figure with a very honorable man out there some books at the library to take all the necessary knowledge for him to be able to face what uh tomorrow holds for him then after him doing that it changes that it says well you have a seed you have a Dolph but that's not enough let me bring it down and in order for us to receive anything physical what do we do for any human beings born on Earth natural sense will tell you we need to have a wife in order for us to have a child so what does he do he brings out a woman he brings out nimrodha Nimrod wife and says well this is the mother who shall bear the seed so now since the mother will be bearing the seed what do we see now we see now we only you can only expect that the seed will come through the woman and he will also take the scripture and tell you like you know hey the promise is given that a the woman the seed of the woman shall come forth but now as I Am The Interpreter of the scripture the revealer of the word for you and here it is now that I'm showing you that it is going to be because remember his purpose is to bring the people to ignore God totally to destroy the relationship between God and man and then bring that attention to him because he's physical with them because when the job or your work becomes a very physical and very attractive to you then you start ignoring everything else that will give you life is a very uh natural or very sensible thing to understand so now what is it doing it's bringing the people now slowly but surely without the people realizing that hey you get so busy into doing what you do that what is supposed to give you life you start ignoring it one stage at the time the woman now comes about the women start ruling that's why we see the types of Jezebel we see of mystery Babylon and all these things throughout the Bible because at the very same practice he keeps doing it because even the United States as the prophet shows us that you know the church the the people came from a different land in order to worship God freely but then very soon and then they took the woman they put there and and they put Jezebel behind and to to try to lead the things about you see but then Nimrod it says though his mystery is uh though his Mysteries he reveals to the people that sins the great invisible father God does not concern himself in the Affairs of man because people could fall sick people could go into all kind of troubles but they didn't have any solutions then he says but then remain silenced relative to them then it follows that he may well be worshiped in silence is bringing the people now to understand like since God that you worship so much doesn't talk to you worship Him in silence when you go to church you don't need to Rejoice just say that just be quiet just be just be formal you know don't don't don't don't don't express yourself too much because there's no relationship between you and the one that you're worshiping it's a natural uh continuity of fact then he says actually it means to ignore him as much as possible if not all together so he the Creator that was to that created the human beings to worship him now the devil now or Nimrod has come about and started drawing the people away and say like you know just ignore him all together because it doesn't it doesn't give you food but your job does it's a it's a it's a it's a natural thing then but I'm saying I'm still in the programming Church ages it says since it was not necessary to worship God the Creator father it was only natural that that worship sung to the mother and child as the object of adoration in Egypt there was the same combination of mother and son called Isis and Oris or or series everywhere you go in the world either you be from Africa you'll be from Europe or Asia or America everywhere you go you find the same things the relationship between mother and son my mother said my mother said my mother said that Spirit didn't start here but then it started way back there where you see a man cannot emancipate himself but then he's still bound under the shackle of the church The Simpsons The Same Spirit because he understood how can you drive the people away because then we see now that if throughout the land this worship when you go for instance in Africa you'll find that people have all kind of Customs you'll find that you know they have a material called Customs where the children belong to the mother when you go to America you find the same when you go to Asia you find the same and then when the same Nimrod started now evolving it started understanding that well how can I get every every single person under this anointing without them realizing that I am the one because the very next stage after the murder to give birth he has to give birth what to the son because now as the sun is getting ready to come now there must be a way now how to fade the church the woman of out of the scene so now what does it do it comes about he understands it it puts now first Traditions into the people from one part of the world to another when you look in Rome you find that when Christianity came to them what did they do teaches us that in the church church ages he said he lays down uh uh the system I breeded or he put together the Roman Pagan worship with Christianity by blending that together what seemed to be the truth with now the statute and with all the Traditions it Blended together so now the people now everything they can remember is that the worship now swung now to the ancestors so this is where you see from anywhere else everywhere you go in the in the world you find that especially Africa India and and everywhere you can go you'll find that you know they have all kinds of statues you go I believe in the Philippines and in all these countries of Asia you even find that at times they will bury people but then time to time they go and unearth them to try to watch them and said hey these are our ancestors we have to take care of them look at where we started we started with God the Father brought them away showed them like you know just a load of and now is bringing them on this side to save us time then we see now that since now he brought the people under this combination of religion and ancestry worship now it becomes so confusing amen among you can die but we hear life we don't call them sins my brother is not descend but once he dies he becomes a sense it becomes a sense then Brothers says in the message going to uh get it for us here in the message Christianity versus idolatry paragraph 83 now when Christianity came to Rome in the very city of Rome had 400 Pagan's temples inside the seven Mill walls 400 Pagan temples and there were the gods and the goddesses God gods and goddesses women and men Gods 400 different ones of them think of it 400 now that's what found when that's what Paul founded in Rome when it came to Rome that's what Akila and Priscilla had when the the they were sent away from from Pentecost and established a church in Rome that's what they came into Pagan Worship in Pagan worship of Idols there was there was around 2 million people in Rome in Metropolitan Rome that's it the slaves and the outside Suburbans and so forth and around to be to 2 million people but the walls around Rome was seven seven miles and and inside of them seven miles right at the foot of uh of the of the mountain was around 400 pagans temples to the to uh to to pagan gods and goddesses I'd like to speak here just a moment it on something that I've taken from histories I've got one right here with me the way they entered into worship how did they come to worship how did they how did a pagan come to worship the first thing he did was to was was go to the temple and find the priest the Pagan priest then he would give him a offering of of much money and then a sacrifice an animal to appears the the god that that he was going to speak to and in sometimes in one Temple there'd be more one of a different kind a different kind of God you look an entire world you go to India you have the same thing in one in one country you have the god of nature the god of rain the god of fertility the God of this the god of that you go to to Europe as he said it here you go for a different different places though it's not really as prevalent today but you have to you still have those museums where they show you like you know since there's a sense that sense this sense that and you come to Africa to this day you still have people who who say like you know according to our traditions why because the only thing they can remember for all these times that they were not in touch with the Living God was that they presented to them god and goddesses and the prophet is showing to us now that the people how did they come to worship they will go to a priest because they took the very same pattern where uh are killing Priscilla went to Rome and preached the word and they replaced it with their own uh or their own things and when they brought those things before the people the people said what understand and know like you know this was uh uh uh Beethoven and this was uh such a people and this was such a people I think like if I receive the spirit of Beethoven I can do some of the greater the great music like he did he said that many times when we receive a spirit when we receive that Spirit we will do exactly what that person did previously that's why even when we did just the same way as we don't name uh our children Jezebel not because the name Jezebel is wrong but the life that Jesus believed that brings an anointing that influences people that's why program also shows us he says watch the names that you give to your children but then today what do we name our children after the greatest basketball player the greatest man out there the greatest you know very influential man I want my son to be like such because he's he's done a wonderful work and things even when we've seen the cars manufacturing industry you see that you know we can take a name of a great sign a scientific and intellectual person out there name of a Tesla because they get inspired by the life the person lived and but then behind it but I'm saying said watch out that when you are doing that you also are receiving a spirit but then now that Spirit now will lead you into a direction without you even realizing where are you headed to so now that Spirit as it's leading you throughout life you'll think like you know oh I've made the greatest inventions I've built the greatest company and all these things but then at the end of the day it doesn't show you where your end will be with that kind of spirit amen amen so now the Lord now wants to restore the relationship that's what William Burnham says that you know the only reason why I'm still worth doing this work is not to bring people to follow me it's not people to follow my to receive my spirit it's not for people to receive a church Spirit but instead to re-establish a true relationship between God and Men the very something that God destroyed for many years the Lord now has to bring it to pass to bring it back again but then yet at the same time the Lord says but then before mid to re-establish that relationship clearly people have to know people have to know what has happened because as when we come to God we cannot just show up to God and say like you know Lord I'll come back no that's why we come with repentance repentance is the fact of saying exactly what happened without trying to play words like a lawyer no according to this you know what I didn't really mean no because the person himself have to understand that I've been separated the relationship has been broken because the vow between you and your wife for you and your husband has been broken because of the event that had taken place since that event has taken place for you now to re-establish now that relationship again it's for you to repent by repenting is exactly telling exactly what happened just as brother Branham uh said that dealt with uh a Sunday school teacher she had a spirit upon her she didn't know what what was going on they prayed for her once or twice they didn't work then she comes on the the prayer line Burnham prays it doesn't work then she meets on the road then it doesn't still nothing is still happening then she goes to to his house they say like well she said he says to his wife you say well give me a time with her then when he goes uh it the vision comes and say oh I see I see you in such a day you had this this and this and that okay this is what had happened don't tell that to nobody but that's your life don't be ashamed of it it has happened the relationship has been broken the devil has found his way into your life now the only way for you to come back is through repentance because the propitiation is already presented the blood is already there but then the blood is only waiting for your repentance first when you come under with repentance under the blood then the devil has no right to still remain there amen because that with that that understanding what do we do I'm going to force my agenda on the pastor I'm going to force my agenda on people I'm going to convince my brother or my sister you know if people really know this and my my reputation you know no that devil is is legally bound to stay there so therefore now what does it go what is what is God doing is now showing the people what has happened that the the reason why you behave the way you behave it's because of your culture your Traditions your religion has molded you into what you are and since now you've been molded into what you are then now you have to have the understanding on your way back because whenever preaches the message the way back he shows how a young man went to war he had a mental issues and all kinds of things then to find his way back he has to look at the uh at the way on the ground it is the same way with us today that the word given to us is given to us for restoration it's not given to us for condemning it's not given to us for just destroying but the word in whatever form or Shepherd comes is for restoration because that's why many times when people listen to the words like ah the preacher was too hard no the purpose that at times it has to hurt it's because that part has to be kicked on a little bit harder because sometimes your stubborn Spirit doesn't just accept any kind of some form of massage but it requires a good punch because when Jesus himself went to into into hell he didn't go there and said the devil like you know uh Mr devil you know I paid the price no you're self also when you re when you understand that you come to the realization that hey this is my given right this is my privilege I cannot stay shackle under this without me realizing what had happened Lord this has happened husband this is has happened father this has happened pray for me until then that devil will still be bound there Let It Be culture Let It Be Your Society let it be anything that you're holding yourself onto will hold your shackle because in our cultures at times wherever we have a complex complexes of inferiority of superiority you think like you know you're better than this and you you're not better you you just like you know useless person and all that until you understand who you are as a Son of God the daughter of God then that demon will still hold you bound because your confession that's what brings God now to come to do the work because he is the high priest of what of our confession without your confession you will not be able to do anything then your confessional makes you understand that I have to get into the world understand what God has given us today and how am I going to get back to my original position because we are called then we are what anointed then we are what place without these three stages then there's no way for you to be able to get anywhere then for you it's just I cannot demand live they live the good life you had the money he had to build all kinds of things but then the next stage after your death you just don't know what's what's gonna happen so now and then sometimes a different kind of gods well paragraph 87 so that uh so the Pagan priest he would go to him and give him some some money and the Pagan priests that would would give him give him back a candle and a regulator Tallow candle and and the worshiper taking this candle after he had paid the priest taking this candle and goes all it goes over to the certain altar of this God remember he has all kind of gods he comes to a priest the priest gives him a candle the pastor tells him all kinds of stupidity now it takes that now to his heart and say like you know the Pastor said you know I don't need to tell that to my husband because if my if I tell her to my husband my divorce is going to he's going to be split well after you do that we see that brother I'm sure that you know that woman in that condition that didn't resolve her issue she didn't know what was happening with her she said I'm a Sunday school teacher but it doesn't matter your title doesn't matter in this case you know all that you are he doesn't that's why at times like you know you see people years after years in the church but they're still spinning around they're still spinning around go go back to the world you don't go back go get into you receive the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost you can receive the Holy Ghost why because you are stuck inside a certain position because since that event is place in your life now you find yourself like you know I can move forward forward I can't believe I can't go back either but then now confession that's what will do the trick and on this Alto was fire here where the where the sacrifice would be burned at the foot of the statute and all these candidates were up in progress 88 I guess it's so the certain God amongst all the other gods would know just which one of the statute it was he was supposed to get into you know just as today we have people who go you say well I'm going to uh uh how do how do we call them uh psychiatrists I believe people that you go you talk to when you have issues and all kind of things you what's that aside therapist why yeah there you go therapist you see people go to the therapist now they say like well you know the word of God has no effect exactly this is very same pattern to this day it still applies because like you know one will say like well I don't go see I don't I'm not at the altar out there looking at at a statute and all kinds of things but you go to the therapist yet you have the word of God with you you go you watch the movies well I just want to relax a little bit let me have a little bit of Netflix just as we were sharing with one of the fathers the other day and I said like you know yeah with the young people now today like you know it's all about Netflix and chill and things he said like you know I don't know what Netflix is I say yeah of course you have to catch up you have to know what's going on with your children now they have a different altar before them because but with them there they had uh the altar of uh of TV with everybody but now the child doesn't go out anymore why doesn't it go out because he has an altar right there in the home and nobody knows about it the father wants to come to the room it's my privacy but then behind those those closed door a whole service of worship is taking place that's what the prophet is showing us here that's why the word is not historical the word is a is a it's it's pragmatic it's something that you see it's something that you touch you can see how somebody growing in the word how they're being shaped and how they become nicer to everybody how they open how they the simple the how they they have a welcoming Spirit as we see it with brother brother I mean the uh in the prayer line they say like you know oh sister I see you have a wonderful atmosphere around you are you a Christian oh brother it is the same Oh Sister you're not from this church but you're from a very wonderful teacher you've been taught the word correctly why the very same Spirit of the Living God in that church in that home in that brother in that sister will reproduce the very same thing either you be from Africa either you'll be from Europe either America wherever you come from that Spirit upon you we all going to behave the same way but anything else outside of that we can only give us the understanding not to judge you but to make you understand what can the spirit is upon you and how to get out of it get exposure to the world let be washed by the word be transformed by the word in order to be ruptured one of these days or for us who are alive and remain amen I believe I'm not running out of time amen and he would go back there out on the floor of the Tabernacle and there he would prostrate himself on the on the floor and there he would put all kind of uh you'll put out he'll put all of his souls and his strength into his prayer and pray to this great God of some Soldier a make-believer a mythical god pray to this God to come down in His image and talk to him the devil he said well now I've taken you from God the Father they said the Dove and the seed now you have the statute of Mary now let me diversify it a little bit since some of you call yourself Buddhist okay here's the statue of Buddha since uh you are called uh probably only the the the Congolese Brothers will understand this um the god of munama the God of War they worship water because they see they have a lot of water and to them is a great mystery what's in the water when they see the girls are floating out of the water they say that's our God is rising up to talk to us if you get closer to the water you're going to die the very same element when you brother I'm saying you come here in America with the Indians and with every and every everybody else even when you go to everything else so that we call a conspiracy theory today where they take the children and they go they sacrifice them all kind of stories behind what is that the very same spirit because even those who are kidnapping the children why are they doing that to sacrifice that to the idols in order for them to remain young longer and they think that eternal life is a matter of sacrifice of a human blood no it requires God's blood for you to live eternally so then the devil now I'm painting the picture of it the entire world regardless of where you're from what you're holding on to what you think that your culture your language your all these things was only a way for Nimrod to destroy and to separate people and in order for him to receive all that Glory because he was jealous because he saw that as something that that hey God is creating this I'm his right hand man I'm going to inherit all this but then he says that all that didn't he didn't receive it then all of a sudden say well I need to have my plan now but he thought but he didn't think himself that he was a creation from the Creator that the creator also had his own thinking and also had his own program amen and as and it said that one of the Emperors uh I'm going to jump here look as Grace laughs paragraph 1 178 and I've been uh I've been to some of the sense of Patrick's churches in uh in Northern Ireland yes sir I had the privilege of saying that it was just a big old Hall they didn't have them Idols sticking up and pouring out stuff on their feet and paying for the people to come in there to come back and get in the idol Mary hell Mary Berry Hail Mary and Mother of God the same thing as deed to astate be bewitching the spirit of Mary the very same thing everywhere you go in the world you find that it is a very same Spirit now the Lord now he's saying that all these things are taking place but he says that well God has to come down because that's the very that's the very element before we get where God comes down and what is he going to do and all these things we're going to see uh some wonderful things probably yeah in in another part I don't want to get into everything mix up everything otherwise it'll be a little bit harder to uh to understand the things so the devil now had to present to the people a certain element what people have to know how are they going to stand how are they going to receive how are they going to worship they worship through all these kind of cultures but then as I stated that now we see now that you know in many especially in uh what we call the Western uh civilization you don't see uh all kind of uh you know statutes and things anymore but then the devil also knew that that was going to happen he had to fade away from the people so because people had knowledge especially in the uh in the Reformation age people had access to the books and people had access to knowledge and all these things but the devil was smart he knew that since Martin was was coming with uh with the Reformation I still need my people with me then he introduced teaching education through now education we have a colonization and all these things I'm not saying it in uh in a historical point where you know Africans and all these things and all that that's a whole nother aspect of the world but he wanted to have that in order to indoctrinate the people to change the way people were thinking even unconsciously because that's the greatest deceiving point you can ever find yourself in when you are tricked to do something without you even realizing that that's what you're supposed to do because when Evo found herself in that condition she looked herself and she said this is God let me go now and do what to Adam teach him what it was because the woman the church receive a certain teaching receive the certain mindset receive the certain anointing now she takes that teaching now to come and now invade the entire Garden of Eden you understand the pattern because without understanding this button quickly that we find ourselves into all kind of interpretation like you know oh yeah you know really it's not really we we don't we don't worship any kind of things today yeah we still are we still are to this day people are still under that such anointing then what does the devil do just as the neighbor did in the in those times it took his face and put it upon her Upon Our plate of a plate of money I don't know if the brothers have that picture of nimrode uh so we can say it that Nimrod wanted to propagate his teaching all over the world when he came about he understood that what am I going to do he took the teaching and started teaching along the reformers some of the best teachers he said it's a it's a dream that period of time that we ever know will ever even will ever ever uh will never have after because he knew that let me get to this point he was saying that the time was coming to an end he was saying that the time was closed he had access to the books let me have some of the best teachers the church the greatest Church who has the best schools in the in the land what is it the Catholic Church some of the best educated people the Jew side I believe that it's called the best teachers in the world when they're teaching you without you even realizing you transformed you become very smart you can do some of the great constructions you can do so you can be very eloquent you wouldn't be like uh Peter you wouldn't be like uh uh John and the rest of them who couldn't Express themselves or write their own names because the teaching or education came about transforming people about people now started becoming like you know he's very calm not from the Holy Ghost but teaching told them about like you know body language it knows how to behave he knows how not like you know to get himself out of control you know just like the Greek would say like you know you need to practice self-control you know that self-control now shapes the person over the years somebody who who was a disorderly would couldn't just contain himself and all of a sudden because of teaching he started now becoming calm he said when you come before the people this is how you make your introduction you know you don't repeat yourself as much because people wouldn't understand it you know when you when you're teaching you have to place a board and you make it very pictures to them so they can understand and you repeat it again at the end now people now are absorbed into that kind of teaching that's why we go to school when we go to school whether in what position we find ourselves you have the men here and you have a bunch of students talking in that same way because I'll prove it to you even in the Bible before going into before going into uh into the Excel of Babylon when they were gathering they were just people sitting around about but then after they return that's where all this came from you understand the devil he knew that what we have we call as Pulpit it didn't exist in the Old Testament before departure into Babylon but then after the return and then they had also a puppet why where did they learn it from Babylon and when they receive it from Babylon now it's now a spread across the world because of when God was coming into the Garden of Eden he didn't have a Pulpit when the Lord speaks to you in your room he doesn't need a Pulpit whether was God seeking to do either trying to give us as much information as possible for you to understand it's not just the fact of you coming into a building called Church for you to be in a relationship with God because the Holy Spirit met a Philip along the way because the Holy Spirit met the disciple along the road of Emmaus but then you have now Christians who have been in the realm of the church the only time they get in touch they feel the atmosphere of God in these four buildings though the building of course is uh given for the purpose of worshiping God and adoring him but the relationship between God and the people is not bound in these four walls the devil he knew that when we go to school for all you look all the setup when you go to work you can have this one is sitting at his desk that one is sitting at his desk and this one is sitting here and you can have a conference call all of you are talking and all that you don't have to see each other but then when you go to school you still have the same setup to this day because the Devil Knows Why that by giving them the teaching in that way all of them they are attracted to what is given to them because we are transformed into what we are beholding when you sit in front of a movie you're watching a movie you are being transformed uh slowly but surely into that image don't know when the tomorrow you know just a little bit of this just a little bit of that you feel ashamed of being a natural woman a natural brother you feel ashamed of just having your wife and you think that you should have a one two three girlfriends out there because that started with a teaching some way teaching was received either on television in the magazines in whatever form that is suitable for you in the form of music you put it on nobody will know who who who who Who's the wrong me or I'll pump the music but that the demons the spirits behind those music will only be transforming you slowly but surely and uh as no Nimrod was doing that all these are strategies is doing is using through the media and there was a clip I believe online where they were showing several Medias all of them they were saying the same things but they are not from the same company they say like you know how's this possible oh this is how to control the people this is how they control the people if you open ABC Fox News CNN all of them are still taking you to the same console culture that's taking you to the same this discussion taking you none of them is turning you toward God none let it be a journal that you will read in the morning like you know oh watch your routine every morning when I wake up I take my book my journal I'm subscribed to New York Times Let It Be oh I don't really like New York Times because they are bought by this or regardless of where you're getting that information from understand that there's only two spirits and one of that spirit will take you into a direction where very slowly you find yourself like you know no this is the way how to behave this is the way how to look at Society the Lord is taking me differently than what I have here but God's grace we're going to try to hit a few points here before we be able to close ancestry worship because in this instance you worship who has a a poll came to the city oh he found himself he's preaching to the people and when he's preaching to the people he the people look at people in that condition looked at Paul they started looking at him through the education they had received all over the years right for instance if I say brother Mary grammatically it's wrong right anybody that has been to school brother Mary if you don't say brother Mary you say what Sister Mary right because that's what we learn in school but then the word comes and say Mary is the type of the church in the church we have men and women education and Revelation two different things but then depending on what your background is gives you a perception of the situation it's like a reaction to an action now Paul are coming into the city inspiration to the people look at Paul they said oh the Gods of coming Among Us which gods the ones that Nimrod have placed among them so they can start looking at this that situation as that because the relationship between a garden man was cut off it is the same way today we look at brother Branham and some of us turn around they say like you know oh it is God The Same Spirit the same way that Nimrod understood that hey this how am I going to get these people let me remove that slowly but surely and bring it now to the position when now we are even ashamed to have brother brought him pictures with us why because the education we have received that if we have we showing brother Branham then it's going to be a subject of an idol worshiper but the nails to the Muslim we are other worshiper of who of Jesus because to them Jesus is worthy just a perfect do you do we understand that because that's what the devil is doing either you'll be Muslim Buddha message believer Christian whatever you want to be the devil is going to try to get to use in some form of shape it takes the people I I spoke one time with uh with with a Muslim they say like you know oh you know uh people of this uh of uh of of of this belief among the Muslim they are not the right one because we are the one who have received what the prophet Muhammad has told us and all these things then I sat there in wondering and say that's the very same thing we have in the message it's the very something we have in the message I say look out the devil despite of your religion he wants that attention he wants to be worshiping that manner we come in the message we start looking at brother Branham I was like you know no don't talk about brother pranam you know but Paul tells them he said no don't do that I am your brother I am you and your fellow servant and when we get to that understanding then we start seeing the separation we keep a brother brought them as the prophet of the age we love him as he is but he is our Prophet but we worship God without that understanding we are just partaking to the idol worshiper either by worshiping brother Branham oh we are turning around by having by being ashamed of the message brought by Brother Branham because once you start being ashamed of Moses then what happens next balam will come about will come about to say well why would you be dressing the way you're dressing come to the feast about Pio another God their ways treats you better but then God knows that if it takes you there it's going to destroy you there because God has a program remember from the beginning that it takes you from one position brings you into another position but now in between now whatever happens whatever happens that you have to be aware of whatever spirit that you still holding on to let it be your cultural Spirit Let It Be Your Traditions you'll let it be your education all these are only forms that the devil Nimrod is bringing his worship unto himself amen those vehicles that he is using is only driving you slowly but surely to that worship and now to each one of us like you are a young man at your level 15 years old 16 years old your body starts changing you start having all kind of also pressure upon you that's also another vehicle now you have the word of God that tells you this is how you ought to be this is how you need to dress this is how I need you need to present yourself the choice again is ours so what kind of choice we do are we going to love to look at the message and say like well oh brother I'm also we I have I see in this picture but I'm head this kind of this kind of thing that can also do that well remember the People based on education look at the situation and they wanted to worship tall as one of the Gods the same way you can be looking at Branham and you start looking at him as one of the Gods that since he did that I can also do it today but then without Revelation you wouldn't know why that element is there for that reason only the revelation will explain it a little bit better for you because without Revelation what do we do we embracing Church we're receiving country spirit because you go to Africa people are very energetic you go to the lens where it's very cold the people are a little bit quieter a little bit calm then when you find yourself among that type of people you may find yourself receiving back on the spirit but that doesn't necessarily mean that you are converted but you are only drawn by education to become that education will only teach you how to become how to start doing uh controlling your emotions and all these things but that's not the case but what we are talking about here is the Lord driving and showing all this element because based upon this to close now based upon these elements what is it what is the devil doing is preparing a land in order for him to establish his kingdom and when you start when he's going to we'll see that probably next time that when he's going out to establish the kingdom and we'll see how the a the kingdom is being established today and what are the things are happening today because this is this information is good yeah yeah I'm getting it yeah don't worship but there's a reason why all this information has to be laid down first because now when they establishing the kingdom then God has to come down just as we read uh in Genesis uh Genesis 11 let's read it to the so we can be able to close amen I believe uh the word was a clear enough for everybody Genesis 11 verse 3 and they say one to another go to let us you know the reason why they're able to establish to say to one another it's education because the architect can tell the contractor what to do and what to build right and if all they have the old grammatical structure they can speak one language then they nothing can stop them and he says here verse 3 and they say to one to another Guru let us make brick project management you know mineral resources excavation construction and all these things is tied up in that one sentence let us make brick right so that's when you see all the school system is built around let us make brick to do what let us make break and burn them thirdly and they had break for stone and slime her day of tomorrow and they say go to let us build build us a city and a tower bring everybody together have Google translate bridge the gap between one country to another you don't need anybody to be with you anymore get on the plane go to Japan to China have your Google Google stuff on with you and have all kind of uh just what was released a few days back Apple Pro Vision Pro then you can explore all kinds of things you understand that and all these tools now are being set in place to do what to build a city and a tower right that will see the next time God willing and burn them through me and they had break for stone and and Slimer they had for more and they say go to let us make brick and let us build us a city and a tower whose top May Rich hunt to Heaven just as we see today we want to be multi-planetary species it's still the same thing to reach other planets it's basically the same structure here oh it seems like not everybody knows what being multi-planetary species is okay we'll get to that um I love the word eh and they say go to let us build a city and who's taught me reach home to heaven let us make us a name remember three things what was that the first nobody can tell what was the first purpose of nimord worship second religion third a name okay he says like let us make us a name unless we discarded abroad upon the first of the Earth the whole Earth verse 5 I'm going to close with this and the Lord came down to see the city and we have to see how the Lord is coming down and it's coming down in a beautiful way because we read it like you know yeah the the Lord has appeared the picture yeah it's wonderful but we want to see how the Lord is coming down because as the Lord comes down it does wonderful things it's not just a a mystery anymore it's when you see that you say Lord I want to be part of this Lord transforming into this because if we just push you into the Lord transforming you it's it's going to be like ah going to church like to sit there for hours and long sermons and but then when you see what the Lord is doing how is he preparing it then your heart gets excited then your heart wants is longing for more just like our sisters when when they know that you know to in few weeks or in few months I'll be going to my home and you start looking you know if Mama tells you something you just like oh Lord what day is it again in five days okay okay I'll just bear with you one minute by the time she just get that exit door that's it amen and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men build it and the Lord say behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do this they begin to this they begin to do and now have and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do amen but then the picture the entire picture that I'm painting to see that those three stages what Nimrod wanted to do he wanted to receive worship he wanted to build a strong Nation he wanted to have a good religion and we saw tonight how this religion is going to it has been spread across the world through uh tribes and cultures and all these things and all these tribes now he has to fade it now into education from this education now it brings the people now into a common ground the god who had created men after his own image and likeness to worship Him but the devil has turned the people away I Believe by God's grace that as you take it you'll be able to see that each person each person in his own life Lord where is it show it to me by revelation where did I leave you where did I embrace this other program because otherwise it's just like you know let's join Church let's come back and let's go have a service let's have worship let's have all kind of knowledge but then the Lord now is coming down as he comes down he wants to do certain things what is he going to do how is he doing it what is it why is it what are the things that will get into probably the news and see how the prophet has shown these things in a wonderful manner the stage of everything the ministry that now the bride has to do and all these things but God's grace amen shall we pray Heavenly Father once again thank you Lord for your grace and your mercy your kindness it's always a pain before coming to the pulpit knowing on what direction to take but Lord as you have led we know that it's not necessarily based upon the note because you said take no thought on what
