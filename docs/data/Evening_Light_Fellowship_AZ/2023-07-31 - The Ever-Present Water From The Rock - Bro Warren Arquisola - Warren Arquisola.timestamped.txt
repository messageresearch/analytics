[50:14] this his uh suffering but God took him
[50:18] and his son uh asked me if I can pray
[50:22] for the family and uh

[50:36] the title of this message is the
[50:39] ever-present water from The Rock
[50:42] and uh
[50:44] the context is unyielding presence of
[50:49] the Lord
[50:50] let's read John chapter 7 30 37
[50:59] the Bible said
[51:02] in the last day that great day of the
[51:06] feast
[51:07] Jesus stood and cried saying If any man
[51:11] thirsts let him come unto me and drink
[51:15] amen may the Lord bless his word
[51:18] amen you can be seated
[51:24] amen
[51:26] the ever-present water from The Rock
[51:29] Jehovah is always available in times of
[51:33] need that's what the the song of uh the
[51:38] sister today
[51:39] that is always present
[51:42] amen the source of strength that never
[51:46] runs dry
[51:49] the water flowing from The Rock in the
[51:52] desert to quench The Thirst of the
[51:55] Israelites
[51:57] mine sometimes you hear from the
[52:00] advertisement that the Sprite will
[52:03] quench your thirst
[52:05] but the reality
[52:07] God will quench your thirst especially
[52:11] if you live here in the desert
[52:13] amen
[52:15] oh you long for water every day
[52:18] if you feel a headache
[52:20] you need to drink water
[52:23] amen
[52:25] unyielding presence
[52:28] it's an offering support comfort and
[52:32] companionship regardless of challenges
[52:36] difficulties that may arise
[52:40] an enduring dedication to standing by
[52:43] someone's side through thick or thin
[52:47] a powerful expression of care love and
[52:51] devotion that creates a sense of
[52:53] security and Trust in relationship
[52:56] between individuals and that is our Lord
[52:59] Jesus Christ
[53:00] he said I will never leave you nor
[53:02] forsake you until the end of the world
[53:06] that's his promise
[53:07] and I am comforted with that promise the
[53:11] unyielding presence of the Lord Jesus
[53:13] Christ

[56:46] that he would provide everything they
[56:49] had need of till they got into the
[56:52] Promised Land
[56:53] God
[56:55] provided their needs until they got into
[56:59] the Promised Land
[57:02] the pillar of fire was with them
[57:06] you know when they were in the
[57:07] wilderness it's so cold during the night
[57:11] the pillar of fire makes them warm
[57:14] if it's too hot during the day the
[57:17] pillar of cloud

[57:35] God
[57:36] provided them
[57:38] a brussen serpent
[57:41] everything that they need was with them

[57:59] our lives
[58:02] amen
[58:05] Hallelujah in Deuteronomy chapter 8
[58:07] verse 4.
[58:11] the Bible said thy remnant
[58:14] or Raymond walks not old upon thee
[58:17] neither did thy foot swell
[58:21] those 40 years
[58:23] what kind of sandals was the uh they
[58:26] were using it
[58:28] it was God's provision
[58:31] amen

[58:41] fight for you and ye shall hold your
[58:44] peace don't do anything I will fight for
[58:48] you wherever I go wherever you go I will
[58:51] be with you
[58:53] you stand by me I will stand by you
[58:55] that's his promise
[58:59] Exodus 20 23 25 and ye shall serve the
[59:04] Lord your God
[59:05] and he shall bless thy bread and thy
[59:09] water and I will take sickness away from
[59:13] the midst of death if anyone thirsts
[59:16] this morning come and drink
[59:18] that's his uh uh that's his invitation
[59:22] to us
[59:25] Exodus 17 6 behold I will stand before
[59:29] thee upon the rock of in Horeb and thou
[59:33] shalt Smite The Rock and there shall
[59:36] come water out of it
[59:38] that the people may drink
[59:40] and Moses did so
[59:43] in the sight of the Elders of Israel
[59:48] my
[59:51] everything was there
[59:54] are they comfortable no they were
[59:57] rebellious
[59:59] they murmured they complained
[1:00:06] in uh the message God has provided way
[1:00:09] the prophet said
[1:00:12] notice again in this great tremendous
[1:00:15] time
[1:00:17] they run out of bread
[1:00:19] what they're going to do if God told
[1:00:22] them they was going to be Promised Land
[1:00:24] or going to the promised land it's up to
[1:00:28] God to take care of them till they get
[1:00:30] there and the Very Jehovah Jireh was
[1:00:34] right with them
[1:00:36] and then when they run out of bread
[1:00:38] Jehovah Jireh provided a way of bread
[1:00:42] all the way through the wilderness
[1:00:45] man arraigned Out of Heaven
[1:00:49] they run out of water what's the use of
[1:00:53] worrying Jehovah Jireh Lords provided
[1:00:57] sacrifice was right with them
[1:01:02] and he smote The Rock and they speak to
[1:01:04] it from then on and water come
[1:01:08] abundantly
[1:01:09] what are all their cattle thousands of
[1:01:13] gallons per second pouring out of the
[1:01:16] Rock in in a dry desert
[1:01:19] and unreasonable isn't it but God
[1:01:23] provided you don't reason how he does it
[1:01:26] how he does to do it
[1:01:29] he just does it because
[1:01:32] he said so or he would
[1:01:37] you don't need to argue with God you
[1:01:39] don't need to reason with God
[1:01:42] just believe
[1:01:44] that's our you know the song of the
[1:01:47] Prophet only believe all things are
[1:01:49] possible
[1:01:50] if the people will believe you
[1:01:53] even cancer
[1:01:56] no one can touch you and I believe that
[1:01:59] because we are believers
[1:02:02] amen
[1:02:04] why worry
[1:02:06] just just just believe and follow the
[1:02:09] Rock
[1:02:12] but did the Israelites followed
[1:02:16] it's sad because in Jeremiah chapter 2
[1:02:19] 12 13
[1:02:22] the Bible said
[1:02:24] be astonished or ye Heavens at this and
[1:02:29] be horribly afraid
[1:02:32] be very desolate said the Lord for your
[1:02:36] people have committed two evils
[1:02:40] they have forsaken me the Fountain of
[1:02:43] Living Waters
[1:02:45] is that sad
[1:02:49] and you them out of cisterns broken
[1:02:54] cisterns that can hold no water
[1:03:01] what is cisterns
[1:03:04] it's a it's an artificial well
[1:03:09] you know when I was in the Philippines
[1:03:12] we were poor we we don't really know
[1:03:14] what this faucet means
[1:03:16] but we we we always dig a hole
[1:03:21] and then once we dig a hole you know the
[1:03:25] there's this the water will come up
[1:03:28] or come out and then we we get water
[1:03:32] from there
[1:03:33] and we cook rice we you know make a soup
[1:03:36] from that well but the next day you need
[1:03:40] to take all the waters from there
[1:03:43] because the Tad Falls
[1:03:46] the frogs the snakes the germs will
[1:03:50] contaminate the water
[1:03:52] now you need to clean that again and
[1:03:55] again and again
[1:03:57] but God he said don't do anything I will
[1:04:02] provide you clean water
[1:04:05] the people brothers and sisters
[1:04:07] have so many inventions and they dug
[1:04:11] water I will and they keep drinking from
[1:04:16] that dirty well
[1:04:18] and that's what Jeremiah said
[1:04:22] you committed two evils
[1:04:26] my
[1:04:28] but here is what happened in the time of
[1:04:30] Samuel
[1:04:31] you know when when the when the children
[1:04:34] of Israel
[1:04:36] there was a judges for 400 years
[1:04:40] but then the people the children of
[1:04:42] Israel was not satisfied because they
[1:04:45] saw a neighboring countries as kings
[1:04:49] so they decided to come to Samuel and
[1:04:53] ask for a king
[1:04:55] but God said give them what they need
[1:04:58] they did not rejected you they rejected
[1:05:01] me
[1:05:03] Brothers
[1:05:04] don't be influenced by other mega
[1:05:07] churches their their worship
[1:05:10] they spend more time than in singing
[1:05:13] than preaching
[1:05:17] you know the popular music right now is
[1:05:20] they call that the hail song
[1:05:24] they just sing and sing and sing
[1:05:27] but they took a lot of money from the
[1:05:30] people
[1:05:33] and they don't care about if the singers
[1:05:35] is a transgender
[1:05:39] don't look don't don't watch in YouTube
[1:05:41] there the way they sing
[1:05:44] you will be
[1:05:47] disappointed
[1:05:49] because some of them has tattoos
[1:05:52] women has colored hairs
[1:05:54] that's why I thank God for musicians
[1:05:57] here
[1:05:57] that the Holy Spirit are guiding them
[1:06:01] the the the the singers and the
[1:06:03] musicians are praying before to come
[1:06:07] here in the altar
[1:06:09] so that the Holy Spirit Will flow from
[1:06:12] here to the congregation
[1:06:14] I thankful for that
[1:06:16] that we God put us into a right
[1:06:19] direction
[1:06:21] we were there before
[1:06:23] we were we were and learn to do the
[1:06:26] things of the world to the things of God
[1:06:30] but now thank God for the message of the
[1:06:33] hour
[1:06:35] amen
[1:06:39] oh the the Samuel reason with the
[1:06:43] congregation
[1:06:44] he said you know that the king will take
[1:06:47] your your young woman women
[1:06:50] the king will will take a portion of
[1:06:54] your land
[1:06:55] the king will will uh take some of you
[1:06:59] uh and make him uh his servants
[1:07:03] but they don't really care
[1:07:05] they should give us a king
[1:07:08] we want a king
[1:07:11] amen but the Lord said
[1:07:14] oh
[1:07:16] he said they rejected they did not
[1:07:18] rejected you somehow
[1:07:20] they rejected me
[1:07:23] and from this I hope and I pray
[1:07:27] that we will learn
[1:07:30] because they came out from Egypt we came
[1:07:33] out from the Catholic
[1:07:37] Revelation chapter 17.
[1:07:42] in Amos chapter 5 25
[1:07:47] the Bible said
[1:07:49] you know these are the the children of
[1:07:51] Israel
[1:07:52] and God was talking to Amos
[1:07:56] telling to uh to the children of Israel
[1:08:00] did you offer me
[1:08:02] sacrifices
[1:08:05] and offering in the wilderness for 40
[1:08:07] years
[1:08:08] nada
[1:08:10] oh House of Israel you also carried
[1:08:14] Chico
[1:08:15] your king
[1:08:16] and she on your idols
[1:08:20] the star of your gods
[1:08:22] which you name for yourselves
[1:08:28] but because of the rebellion of the
[1:08:31] people
[1:08:32] look at them they they were they were
[1:08:34] not thankful
[1:08:36] instead they brought gods and goddesses
[1:08:43] if they need healing God provided them
[1:08:49] some of them are lifting weights maybe
[1:08:52] we're there and this Daddy I need
[1:08:54] protein a god reigned quail
[1:09:00] my
[1:09:02] tremendous hours
[1:09:04] God was with them
[1:09:06] but instead
[1:09:08] they did not worship God
[1:09:11] they worshiped their own Gods
[1:09:15] and because of the rebellion in Numbers
[1:09:18] chapter 32 11 said
[1:09:21] surely
[1:09:22] none of the men that came up out of
[1:09:25] Egypt from 20 years old and upward shall
[1:09:29] see the land which I swear into Abraham
[1:09:31] unto Isaac another Jacob because they
[1:09:35] have not holy
[1:09:37] followed me
[1:09:40] those people from 20 and up died in the
[1:09:45] wilderness
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:09:47] Brothers
[1:09:49] look at our message right now
[1:09:53] we are the Next Generation we are the
[1:09:57] new generations that we will enter into
[1:09:59] the Promised Land
[1:10:01] oh Brothers if I think about this you
[1:10:05] know when I accepted the message 1996 I
[1:10:09] was I was uh I I see I see my pastor was
[1:10:14] bringing bringing seven Church ages
[1:10:17] Seven Seals and the the spoken words
[1:10:20] bring it here piled up and he will read
[1:10:24] the the message put it there read the
[1:10:27] message put it there we don't we don't
[1:10:29] have this before
[1:10:33] but then
[1:10:37] most of the preaching are brother
[1:10:39] Branham
[1:10:41] uh did this brother Branham did that
[1:10:43] brother Branham but this is not the
[1:10:46] about the prophet anymore
[1:10:49] God the prophet is introducing Jesus
[1:10:52] Christ to us and now our focus is not in
[1:10:55] the prophet anymore but the message of
[1:10:57] the prophet
[1:10:59] this is the message of today that we
[1:11:02] will cross Jordan
[1:11:05] amen
[1:11:06] you know the pro the uh brother
[1:11:11] um
[1:11:12] who is that uh brother
[1:11:14] Joshua was telling me about about Israel
[1:11:18] he was
[1:11:19] there three weeks ago
[1:11:21] and he said the Jericho and the the
[1:11:25] River Jordan he said I saw
[1:11:29] the the piled up of walls of Jericho
[1:11:34] and that was the memorial
[1:11:37] that God broke the heavy stronghold of
[1:11:40] the enemy
[1:11:44] oh I believe this message brother
[1:11:46] amen
[1:11:50] my
[1:11:53] 20 and up perish in the wilderness
[1:11:58] but here
[1:12:00] look at the children of Israel
[1:12:03] the Rebellion they they were
[1:12:06] look at the the way they asked Moses all
[1:12:09] the time
[1:12:10] bring us back to the Wilderness or bring
[1:12:12] us back to Egypt
[1:12:15] they forgot
[1:12:17] that they see all the time the scars on
[1:12:20] their back
[1:12:21] the marks of the sleigh built in their
[1:12:25] hands and feet
[1:12:26] but if there's something trials bring us
[1:12:30] back
[1:12:31] we don't want to die here in the
[1:12:33] wilderness
[1:12:34] but they forgot the scars they forgot
[1:12:38] the the the the Weeping of the Egyptian
[1:12:40] soldiers to them work work work
[1:12:47] want to go back
[1:12:50] it's like heaven to me praise God I
[1:12:53] don't want to go back
[1:12:56] amen the message
[1:12:59] take the road
[1:13:01] and gather the people 1950.
[1:13:05] maybe some of those poor Israelites they
[1:13:10] left garlic and onion onions to eat
[1:13:14] Angels food
[1:13:16] and was complaining about it
[1:13:18] they had left the Muddy Waters of Egypt
[1:13:21] to drink from the Fountain of Life
[1:13:26] unbelievable but it's true paradox
[1:13:31] we're complaining about it they had left
[1:13:35] the boasting Physicians of Egypt to be
[1:13:38] with the great position
[1:13:41] and was complaining about it
[1:13:44] they left a bunch of people that
[1:13:46] believes the days of Miracles were
[1:13:48] passed to be with a bunch of people
[1:13:51] believe that all things were possible
[1:13:54] and still complaining about it
[1:13:56] isn't that just like the church today
[1:14:00] come out of Egypt come out of the world
[1:14:03] out here in this glorious Church of the
[1:14:07] Living God
[1:14:08] the firstborn and because we we little
[1:14:12] try we have little trials God asked us
[1:14:15] to believe and to hold on we still
[1:14:18] complain about it now notice
[1:14:22] another thing they had done they let the
[1:14:25] people back
[1:14:27] there that had no signs to live under
[1:14:30] the pillar of fire and cloud and was
[1:14:33] complaining about it no wonder their
[1:14:36] water supply was cut off
[1:14:38] that's what the matter with the church
[1:14:40] today
[1:14:41] there's too much grumbling about things
[1:14:44] complainings be satisfied and keep
[1:14:47] moving on passing on and when the water
[1:14:51] supply got caught up God asked them to
[1:14:55] go to speak to the Rock
[1:14:57] and it would bring forth its water
[1:15:01] my my
[1:15:03] can you see that
[1:15:05] complain complain complain that's why
[1:15:08] you cannot see Miracles here
[1:15:10] I I seen miracles
[1:15:13] in in other countries
[1:15:16] than here in America
[1:15:18] because if we
[1:15:20] need healing
[1:15:22] oh
[1:15:23] I have a
[1:15:26] insurance card
[1:15:30] I need to see the doctor
[1:15:35] if I am hungry I will open my Samsung
[1:15:39] touch screen
[1:15:41] and take yogurt
[1:15:44] plenty of food
[1:15:47] the the faith is not moving
[1:15:51] because we're countable of everything
[1:15:53] here
[1:15:55] but go to the country that day doesn't
[1:15:58] have food brother they pray hard before
[1:16:01] they eat
[1:16:04] me and brother Jerry went to the
[1:16:06] Philippines
[1:16:07] and we went there
[1:16:10] inside the the that was the Rebellion uh
[1:16:14] former uh Rebel
[1:16:16] we we don't like to go to the big city
[1:16:20] we like to go to the mountains
[1:16:23] and here there was a Believers over
[1:16:26] there
[1:16:27] and this woman she has problem
[1:16:31] her husband was sick and we went inside
[1:16:34] the brother uh me and brother Jerry went
[1:16:36] inside the house and we see the sun
[1:16:41] there was no roof
[1:16:43] and there is oh There are 16 typhoons
[1:16:48] every year in in the Philippines
[1:16:51] or more
[1:16:53] there they got a a very heavy typhoon
[1:16:56] super typhoon last week over there
[1:16:58] so this woman
[1:17:00] brother Jerry was crying
[1:17:03] he said I live in a big house in America
[1:17:07] we will do something about it
[1:17:10] and I was like waiting for Brother Jerry
[1:17:13] when we got here
[1:17:15] we asked the the pastor how much to
[1:17:18] build the house
[1:17:20] and the Pastor said six hundred dollars
[1:17:22] I called brother Jerry brother Jerry
[1:17:25] give me 300 I will spend 300.
[1:17:29] because I cannot see a Believer is the
[1:17:33] same faith
[1:17:34] fighting every day
[1:17:37] the same with you
[1:17:39] hand in hand with you they're gonna go
[1:17:42] to the Rapture if you will not go
[1:17:45] we will go together
[1:17:47] but it's sad because they live in a
[1:17:50] different countries
[1:17:52] Brothers they showed us after months
[1:17:55] they showed us a photo it was a brand
[1:17:59] new house
[1:18:01] me and brother Jerry Built
[1:18:03] six hundred dollars
[1:18:09] that's what the brother brother Ron was
[1:18:11] saying there's so many unknown
[1:18:14] missionaries that you don't even know
[1:18:16] them
[1:18:17] but they work hard to bless the Bride of
[1:18:21] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:26] amen
[1:18:28] but here's Joshua
[1:18:31] the new generation
[1:18:34] one nine
[1:18:36] I commanded thee be strong and good
[1:18:40] courage Be not Afraid neither be thou
[1:18:43] dismayed for the Lord thy God is with
[1:18:47] thee whatsoever or where where's you
[1:18:50] ever the ghost wherever thy goest
[1:18:54] if I will go to heaven God is in there
[1:18:57] if I go to the pits of Hell God is in
[1:19:00] there
[1:19:02] wherever thy goeth
[1:19:04] I will be with you remember I was
[1:19:07] thinking about this
[1:19:09] that when the when they were in the in
[1:19:12] the prom or in the wilderness
[1:19:15] The Rock was following them
[1:19:18] if they need Healing The Rock provided
[1:19:21] them if they need Manna God provided
[1:19:23] them if they need uh something that that
[1:19:27] uh they needed they God is our provider
[1:19:30] of their needs he's the Jehovah jira
[1:19:33] but then when Joshua crossed the Jordan
[1:19:36] River
[1:19:37] the Rocks stopped following them
[1:19:41] and then this rock
[1:19:43] where is am I fighting alone
[1:19:46] brother no because the rock became man
[1:19:50] and then here's Joshua in the midst of
[1:19:54] these trials and troubles he was Facing
[1:19:57] the Giants
[1:19:59] does according to the prophet the wall
[1:20:02] and Jericho can can
[1:20:04] raise uh how do you call that the
[1:20:07] Chariots
[1:20:10] on the top of the wall
[1:20:12] Chariot can raise how big is that
[1:20:17] brother
[1:20:19] but then in the midst of that pressure
[1:20:23] The Rock became man
[1:20:26] he said I am the captain of The Lord of
[1:20:28] hosts
[1:20:29] I will not leave you nor forsake you I
[1:20:33] will fight for you
[1:20:35] the sword was open ready to fight the
[1:20:38] battles
[1:20:40] and they destroyed the wall of Jericho
[1:20:44] see the houses even the the prophets had
[1:20:46] on the wall there was houses
[1:20:50] but there is no bigger things in the
[1:20:53] sight of God
[1:20:55] it's all the same just believe it
[1:20:58] and it will settle said amen
[1:21:02] my that's the drug that was following
[1:21:05] them and then here's the message
[1:21:09] in Corinthian chapter uh First
[1:21:11] Corinthians chapter 10 1. to four
[1:21:15] it said moreover brethren
[1:21:17] I would not that she should be ignorant
[1:21:21] how that all our fathers were under the
[1:21:25] cloud and all pastored the sea and where
[1:21:29] all baptizing to Moses in the clouds and
[1:21:32] in the sea and did all eat the same
[1:21:35] spiritual meat and did all drink the
[1:21:38] spiritual rock or spirit will drink
[1:21:41] but they drunk of that spiritual Rock
[1:21:45] and that rock followed them and that
[1:21:49] rock was Christ
[1:21:52] that rock was Christ Jesus
[1:21:56] and here in the midst of the of the
[1:21:59] Pharisees
[1:22:01] Jesus was standing there uh uh with them
[1:22:05] and then Jesus said
[1:22:07] uh and the the prophet said here in the
[1:22:10] Hebrew chapter 4 he said Moses the one
[1:22:14] that told you that he longed to see my
[1:22:16] day
[1:22:17] and he saw it in portion he said now you
[1:22:21] mean to tell us that you're greater than
[1:22:23] Moses
[1:22:25] that you see Moses
[1:22:28] and Moses has been dead 800 years
[1:22:31] said now
[1:22:33] we know that you got a devil in other
[1:22:37] words Loco
[1:22:39] crazy we know that you're crazy
[1:22:44] he said before Abraham
[1:22:47] I am
[1:22:49] The Great I Am that was in the burning
[1:22:52] bush I am the fire that was in the
[1:22:54] burning bush I am the angel that went
[1:22:57] before them he said I come from God and
[1:23:00] I go back to God and he came from God
[1:23:03] made flesh and dwelt Among Us went back
[1:23:06] to the same Pillar of Fire here he is
[1:23:09] tonight after a thousand years the same
[1:23:12] yesterday today and forever
[1:23:15] he is the same God today brothers and
[1:23:17] sisters if you believe he's the rock
[1:23:20] that follows you he's the stronghold of
[1:23:23] our faith
[1:23:24] Brothers Oh in German in John chapter
[1:23:28] 14. he said as the spirit of Truth whom
[1:23:31] the world cannot receive because it sees
[1:23:34] him not neither knoweth him but you know
[1:23:39] him for he dwelleth with you and shall
[1:23:42] be in you I will not leave you
[1:23:45] comfortless or abandoned
[1:23:47] I am with you
[1:23:50] I will come to you in a little while the
[1:23:54] world will see me no more but ye shall
[1:23:56] see me because I live he shall live
[1:24:02] oh ye shall live also and that day is
[1:24:06] this day
[1:24:07] ye shall know that I am in the father
[1:24:10] and ye in me and I in you what a comfort
[1:24:17] rock that was with them is here today
[1:24:21] brothers and sisters if you believe
[1:24:24] anything are possible
[1:24:26] hallelujah oh Brothers if I think about
[1:24:30] him
[1:24:31] it's it's the God that was following
[1:24:35] them
[1:24:36] became a man
[1:24:38] and now in the at in the last days the
[1:24:42] God that was in heaven came down and
[1:24:46] where is the Throne of God is in US
[1:24:48] that's why the message when brother
[1:24:51] Branham was was a uh uh he was a I think
[1:24:54] he was a
[1:24:56] uh uh he works in the forest preserve
[1:24:59] before and then when he was walking he
[1:25:02] saw a spring of water
[1:25:05] and then the spring of water was
[1:25:07] attracted his attention
[1:25:09] and he drink from there and when he
[1:25:12] drink from there he said I will go back
[1:25:15] the next month because it was sweet and
[1:25:18] and it's better taste than any meal any
[1:25:22] water from Costco
[1:25:24] so now
[1:25:26] he went there again and he attracted his
[1:25:29] attention because the water was
[1:25:31] sparkling
[1:25:33] and he was said
[1:25:34] why you're so jolly
[1:25:37] he asked the water
[1:25:40] it's not crazy
[1:25:43] sometimes you I act crazy
[1:25:46] but
[1:25:47] I I lost my mind when I accepted Christ
[1:25:50] 27 years ago
[1:25:52] so I'm okay I'm okay
[1:25:58] we're not Pentecostals we were Catholics
[1:26:00] when when I accepted Christ all I do is
[1:26:03] just sign up the cross and recite the
[1:26:07] the Novena
[1:26:09] but here it's a different story
[1:26:13] my I lost my mind when I accepted the
[1:26:15] message so here's the prophet was
[1:26:18] drinking and he said
[1:26:20] can you tell me Spring of water
[1:26:23] now tell me
[1:26:26] tell me um
[1:26:27] maybe because the deer drinks from you
[1:26:31] the water can say
[1:26:34] can say he said he will say no
[1:26:37] because the deer drinks for me I'm not
[1:26:40] happy
[1:26:42] I'm always happy
[1:26:44] oh
[1:26:45] um
[1:26:46] how about maybe the birds comes and
[1:26:49] drinks from you
[1:26:51] you can say nope
[1:26:54] not
[1:26:55] not because
[1:26:56] the the birds come and drink maybe
[1:26:59] because I come here and drinks from you
[1:27:00] he will say no
[1:27:02] my my my my the water is kept bubbling
[1:27:06] bubbling bubbling all the time even you
[1:27:09] don't come here and drinks from me
[1:27:12] so why are you so happy
[1:27:15] the water will say not because of you
[1:27:20] uh drinking from me it's it's something
[1:27:24] inside of me
[1:27:26] there's something pressure inside of me
[1:27:29] that comes out
[1:27:30] that's the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:27:33] Christ I don't care the trials are so
[1:27:36] heavy there's a water a Fountain of
[1:27:40] Living Water that comes out for me
[1:27:42] there's some a pressure inside of me
[1:27:45] that in the midst of Trials and testing
[1:27:48] I will praise him because he is worthy
[1:27:51] to praise
[1:27:52] [Applause]
[1:27:57] brother Chris
[1:27:59] remind went to to
[1:28:03] um
[1:28:03] in Montana about this big volcano
[1:28:07] and he said I asked him if the Old
[1:28:10] Faithful is still there he said yeah
[1:28:13] still there brother and I asked him
[1:28:15] about the pressure that comes out
[1:28:18] so one time we and my family went to to
[1:28:22] the great Old Faithful and brother you
[1:28:26] see the Fountain of water the pressure
[1:28:29] inside every 40 minutes you count it and
[1:28:35] because of the pressure Brothers it
[1:28:38] comes out every 40 minutes
[1:28:40] it's so high
[1:28:42] because of the pressure
[1:28:45] and it's the same to the Believers
[1:28:48] the pressure
[1:28:50] of God in us will bring forth praises to
[1:28:54] Him
[1:28:55] oh I don't need somebody to tell me to
[1:28:58] praise him I don't need the pastor to
[1:29:01] tell me to lift up your hands it's
[1:29:03] automatic because the pressure of God is
[1:29:07] in me
[1:29:08] Hallelujah
[1:29:19] I will quench my thirst
[1:29:29] the prophet here
[1:29:31] in the message he said
[1:29:34] here we are
[1:29:36] end timer
[1:29:37] red light down flushing coming of the
[1:29:42] Lord is at hand yes sir listen the end
[1:29:45] little message should meet
[1:29:48] and time condition
[1:29:51] there's they got off the message
[1:29:54] ought to bring back always enter message
[1:29:56] meets end time conditions
[1:29:59] see that
[1:30:01] I was thinking why we are here in this
[1:30:04] polluted age
[1:30:07] but is there's a pressure of the world
[1:30:09] in you yes
[1:30:12] but I still praise him
[1:30:15] yes heavy pressure
[1:30:18] you see all the time
[1:30:20] but I used to it
[1:30:22] because if the storms comes the eagle
[1:30:25] fly high higher than storm because your
[1:30:30] wings are created to spread and fly high
[1:30:34] oh I believe every time I go to work I
[1:30:38] listen to the podcast from our church
[1:30:41] the evening Light Fellowship podcast
[1:30:45] it's a music
[1:30:47] and every time it attracts my attention
[1:30:50] the song that the brother I think David
[1:30:53] Cleveland and all of you
[1:30:56] are very good singers
[1:30:58] but it touched my heart
[1:31:01] when I heard this song
[1:31:03] and the the the the the song said
[1:31:08] you know I asked for
[1:31:10] for healing
[1:31:12] and I got free of pain
[1:31:15] I asked for rain
[1:31:19] or a sunlight
[1:31:20] and I have rain
[1:31:23] but in the midst of it
[1:31:26] I still trust you
[1:31:29] I still trust you
[1:31:31] some people will go back because they it
[1:31:35] seems like they did not get what they
[1:31:37] expect they didn't get what they asked
[1:31:39] but in the midst of that I may not get
[1:31:43] it I may not see healing in me
[1:31:47] but I still trust him
[1:31:50] I still trust him in this old world and
[1:31:55] weary land
[1:31:58] him
[1:31:59] amen
[1:32:02] all of you are warriors here
[1:32:05] no doubt about it
[1:32:08] I salute you all
[1:32:10] amen
[1:32:12] I salute brother of all
[1:32:19] my
[1:32:20] you know when
[1:32:22] Paul and Silas
[1:32:24] when they were beaten
[1:32:27] they were they were
[1:32:30] they were
[1:32:32] in pain
[1:32:34] inside of prison
[1:32:36] you know what they did
[1:32:39] because of the pressure inside of them
[1:32:43] instead of complaining
[1:32:45] instead of crying why why why
[1:32:49] they lift up their hands and sing
[1:32:53] oh brothers and sisters it's not finish
[1:32:58] it The Same Spirit that was full and
[1:33:01] Silas is still here that in the midst of
[1:33:04] Trials and testing
[1:33:06] oh God I will trust him
[1:33:10] I heard the testimonial brother from
[1:33:13] from Venezuela
[1:33:15] this brother just went for a meeting
[1:33:19] and you know what happened
[1:33:20] the police stopped there the the the the
[1:33:23] checkpoint there was a checkpoint and
[1:33:26] then
[1:33:26] this the checkpoint uh was the the
[1:33:30] police came up and they looked for uh
[1:33:33] drugs and they found a drug in this
[1:33:36] backpack and the driver pointed
[1:33:39] that back backpack was owned by a
[1:33:41] brother
[1:33:43] and the brother said no
[1:33:45] it's not my backpack
[1:33:47] I will go to the meetings
[1:33:49] I'm a Christian
[1:33:51] but you know it's Venezuela they don't
[1:33:53] care about you so they put him to jail
[1:33:57] for five years
[1:33:58] it seems it's so hard
[1:34:01] huh but in the midst of that prison in
[1:34:05] inside the prison he shared the word of
[1:34:08] God and he started the church inside
[1:34:11] and after five years he got out and he
[1:34:14] said I want to go back to my people
[1:34:20] wherever we go I still trust you
[1:34:24] in the midst of Trials and tests you
[1:34:27] know it come out the pressure from Silas
[1:34:31] and Paul and the the pressure was so
[1:34:34] strong that it opened the prison house
[1:34:38] cause of faith
[1:34:41] I was thinking about this man he was he
[1:34:45] he just accepted Christ and it's always
[1:34:48] bubbling in his heart all the time and
[1:34:50] then the daughter said Daddy I will have
[1:34:53] a visitor
[1:34:54] tonight
[1:34:56] maybe I will
[1:34:58] I will hide the Bible
[1:34:59] and I will give him a geography book
[1:35:04] so and then the dad went went into the
[1:35:06] attic and he read the geography book
[1:35:12] once you become a Christian everything
[1:35:15] you see are Christ you go to the
[1:35:17] mountain you see Christ you go somewhere
[1:35:20] you see Christ because you are
[1:35:23] Christians your life is in Christ
[1:35:26] and then he was reading and he found out
[1:35:29] that they they cannot find the Deep of
[1:35:32] the sea
[1:35:33] it's so deep
[1:35:34] and when he
[1:35:36] put that to his
[1:35:38] sin he said so if that if the the the

[1:37:27] dream one time
[1:37:28] and on that dream
[1:37:30] God was with them and he was walking
[1:37:33] with God on the seaside
[1:37:37] but then when he had a big trials and
[1:37:42] test in this life it seems that God left
[1:37:45] him
[1:37:47] it was so sad for him and he all of the
[1:37:50] sudden he cried out
[1:37:52] to God and to ask and ask him Lord when
[1:37:56] I was a happy Christian you always with
[1:38:00] me
[1:38:01] but now in the midst of my troubles and
[1:38:04] trials
[1:38:05] where are you

[1:38:10] but then God replied to him and said my
[1:38:14] son if you see once at the footprints
[1:38:17] it's not you anymore because in the
[1:38:20] midst of your trials in the midst of

[1:40:46] I still
[1:40:49] praise the Lord amen
[1:40:54] oh David one time
[1:40:56] when he was in the midst of his trials
[1:40:59] the people rejected him
[1:41:02] he was crying
[1:41:04] in the on the mountain
[1:41:08] it was sad because he was a rejected
[1:41:11] King
[1:41:12] but then in the midst of this
[1:41:15] deep depression
[1:41:18] he remembered when he was a young young
[1:41:21] man
[1:41:22] that he was sitting on the water Brooks
[1:41:28] and they started singing
[1:41:30] that's the deer panted for
[1:41:34] the water so my soul longing after you
[1:41:39] you alone Are My Strength what else
[1:41:43] brother Robert
[1:41:45] my source
[1:41:46] and I will stress
[1:41:50] and you know I may not know the the
[1:41:53] whole song but here's David
[1:41:56] he said
[1:41:58] I love for that water
[1:42:02] I long for that water
[1:42:04] when I was a young man when I was a
[1:42:07] pastor of the Sheep
[1:42:09] I I'm sitting in my trials and my test
[1:42:12] after I fought with the with the lion
[1:42:15] and the bear I can go to that water
[1:42:18] books and drink water from there
[1:42:21] and you know what these three men
[1:42:24] Warriors is cut things I forgot the
[1:42:28] three names but one of them are binaya
[1:42:30] he killed brother 300 soldiers
[1:42:35] and then here
[1:42:36] when they heard that message of David
[1:42:41] it was a longing for David
[1:42:43] but for them it was a command
[1:42:46] because the master is looking for water
[1:42:51] Brothers the monsters longing for Waters
[1:42:55] oh brother they went to the stronghold
[1:42:58] of the enemy and draw water from there
[1:43:04] they jeopardize their lives
[1:43:07] the master was longing for water
[1:43:10] and when they brought that
[1:43:13] David you know what he did instead of
[1:43:17] drinking that water because of the
[1:43:19] longing from deep within
[1:43:22] he poured out to God
[1:43:24] because he said
[1:43:26] I cannot believe that my words was a
[1:43:31] command for my soldiers
[1:43:35] you know what happened
[1:43:37] he worshiped God
[1:43:39] because he was rejected
[1:43:42] but there are people
[1:43:45] there are believers that no matter what
[1:43:49] they followed him because he was the
[1:43:52] source of life
[1:43:54] he was the source of everything
[1:43:57] David is Christ in our day
[1:44:00] now Jesus Christ when he came in John
[1:44:03] chapter 4. he was longing for water
[1:44:07] and he was the source of Life brother
[1:44:10] but why he was the one asking for water
[1:44:14] he was asking a water to the prostitute
[1:44:17] woman
[1:44:18] give me a drink
[1:44:21] give me a drink
[1:44:24] we don't fellowship with you

[1:44:31] but he said no

[1:44:37] you will ask me for a drink
[1:44:40] it's vice versa Brothers
[1:44:43] sisters you asked many times to God what
[1:44:47] did you give him
[1:44:49] as the Bible as the Bible said while ago
[1:44:52] instead of offering

[1:44:56] Alfred sacrifices to their gods
[1:45:00] to
[1:45:01] Jehovah God
[1:45:03] Fellowship what is fellowship it's too
