[13:29] come this morning.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; Several prayer requests here this
[13:34] morning. The Walters
[13:37] want to give God all the glory for being
[13:39] with Camille this week. She was
[13:41] hospitalized on Monday with pneumonia
[13:43] and she made an amazing recovery. God is
[13:45] so good.
[13:46] Thank the Lord for being with Camille.
[13:48] The Lord just continue to strengthen
[13:50] her. Sister Ramona Dulos. This is my
[13:53] daughter Vanessa has breast cancer. She
[13:57] goes to see the surgeon on Tuesday.
[13:58] Please pray for a complete healing.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; The family is both parents.
[14:04] [snorts]
[14:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; Looks like both parents on both sides
[14:10] have cancer. Amen. So pray the Lord
[14:13] would be with Vanessa this week. She
[14:15] goes to see the surgeon.
[14:18] So I remember
[14:20] Sister Victory says she has flu-l like
[14:23] symptoms. Please keep her in prayer this
[14:25] morning.
[14:27] Ron gave me a request here for brother
[14:29] Eric Andress. He's having knee and hip
[14:31] pain. He can hardly walk. So let's
[14:33] remember the Eric in prayer as well. We
[14:35] have a unspoken prayer request for
[14:37] Sister Becky Page. Lord knows what that
[14:40] need is. Do you have a need this
[14:41] morning? Just want to lift it before the
[14:43] Lord with Randy if you would count.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[14:51] &gt;&gt; Let's all bow our heads.
[14:54] Gracious Lord, we first give you thanks
[14:56] that you made a way that we could be
[14:58] here today,
[15:02] Lord. And we're standing on that rock of
[15:04] a
[15:06] revelation, a seed you put in our heart,
[15:08] Lord, that
[15:10] &gt;&gt; there's a promise at the end of this.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, we don't know what lies before
[15:16] today and the end of all this,
[15:19] &gt;&gt; but our faith is going to see us
[15:21] through. Lord,
[15:22] &gt;&gt; to the world, it might not look like
[15:24] much. Why do you believe that? Why do
[15:26] you do that? Why do you stand? Why do
[15:28] you women dress that way? Why do you
[15:34] Lord, you chose us.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; That's enough for my faith.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; It was your choosing,
[15:45] &gt;&gt; Lord. I want to believe today [music]
[15:47] you chose today, Lord, to strengthen us,
[15:50] to draw us closer. Lord, turn these
[15:53] prayer requests into praise reports. We
[15:55] thank you for all you're doing, what
[15:57] you've done.
[15:59] Lord, I pray that you'd somehow just
[16:02] lift us up a little higher, Lord. It's
[16:05] not by strength, not by might,
[16:08] but let your sweet spirit, Lord.
[16:12] Lord, sometimes we want you to
[16:17] change our situations,
[16:19] but Lord, change us.
[16:24] We look to you today.
[16:27] Ask you'd bless the preaching of the
[16:28] word that every heart could receive.
[16:31] May we walk out the doors different
[16:33] today. We ask for your glory, Lord, not
[16:36] for anything else, for your glory in
[16:39] Jesus mighty name. Amen.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Andy. You may
[16:44] be seated this morning. It's good to be

[30:07] bad. I will worship in the waiting
[30:12] [singing]
[30:13] when I cannot see the end. He's never
[30:17] [singing] let me down.
[30:21] And that'll never change. So I'll praise
[30:24] [singing] him anyway.
[30:28] [music]
[30:30] [applause]
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Sister Deborah. Beautiful
[30:40] song. I'll praise him anyway.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have to wait on the Lord
[30:44] and trust in him.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; It's in those times of testings that
[30:48] &gt;&gt; we find victory through our praise.
[30:50] Let's all stand and been thinking of
[30:52] this song. Gratitude.
[30:54] So much to be thankful for. Words fall
[30:57] short. All I have is a simple
[31:00] hallelujah. But Justin, if [music] you'd
[31:02] help sing the verses this morning.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my [singing] words. [music]
[31:14] &gt;&gt; I've done [singing] nothing new.
[31:19] How could I express
[31:25] all my gratitude?
[31:29] [music]
[31:30] Oh, I could sing these
[31:33] [music and singing] songs,
[31:37] &gt;&gt; as I [singing] of
[31:40] [music]
[31:43] every song must stand.
[31:48] Lord, [music and singing] you never
[31:50] knew.
[31:52] Oh, [music] so I'll go [singing] my
[31:56] hands

[32:19] much, but I have nothing else for a king
[32:24] [music]

[32:30] [music]
[32:34] Hallelu.
[32:36] [singing and music]
[32:41] [music]
[32:45] I got one response.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; I've got [music] just one good
[32:56] with my arms stretched wide.
[33:01] I will worship you.
[33:07] So I throw up [singing and music] my
[33:09] hands and praise you again and again.
[33:13] [music and singing] Cuz
[33:16] all that I have is a hallelujah.
[33:27] [singing]
[33:28] [music] And I know it's not much. I'm
[33:32] nothing else fit for a king
[33:37] except for a heart singing hallelujah.
[33:41] [music]
[33:46] Hallelu. [music]
[33:47] [singing]
[33:56] Oh, [music and singing] so come on my
[33:58] soul.
[34:00] Don't you get shy on me. Lift up your
[34:03] song cuz you got [singing] a life
[34:07] [music] inside of those lungs.

[34:28] lion inside of those buns. Get up and

[34:47] soul. cuz you've got a lion inside of

[35:23] And [music]
[35:24] love is not much. But I have nothing
[35:27] else for a king [music]
[35:32] except for a heart singing [singing]
[35:35] hallelujah.
[35:38] [music]
[35:40] Hallelujah.

[37:07] I need you now
[37:11] for your spirit. [music]
[37:12] [singing]
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Bow our heads
[37:19] together this morning. If you have an
[37:21] unspoken request
[37:23] and you didn't get a chance to write it
[37:25] down, remember he is a God
[37:28] &gt;&gt; that can even hear the thoughts and
[37:30] intents of your heart.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; He knows what you're going through. So
[37:35] if you have a need and you'd like God to
[37:38] meet that need, would you just raise
[37:39] your hand right now? Say, "Lord,
[37:42] remember me as I Heavenly Father,
[37:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, you see those hands and you know
[37:48] that every hand is a representation of a
[37:51] need. And Father, we bring our needs,
[37:54] our petitions before you and we have
[37:56] confidence in you, Father, that you know
[37:59] what we have need of even before we ask.
[38:03] But father, it is upon our hearts to ask
[38:07] because if we don't ask, it can't can't
[38:09] be given. Therefore, Father, let us
[38:12] activate the promises. Let us activate
[38:15] those things that we have need of by
[38:18] speaking to the storm, speaking to the
[38:21] issue. Father, I pray that you will
[38:23] bless each and everyone. Bless the
[38:25] ministering of your word this morning,
[38:28] Lord. as we just wait upon you and ask
[38:30] you to be with us.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; We ask it for your glory in Jesus
[38:35] Christ's name.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Turn around, shake
[38:39] somebody's hand, say, "God bless you."
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You can be seated
[38:47] in the presence of the Lord for just a a
[38:50] moment. Hallelujah.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; I was glad when they said unto me, "Let
[38:56] us go to the house of the Lord." Amen.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. No place I'd rather be
[39:01] &gt;&gt; than right here with God's people
[39:04] &gt;&gt; hearing God's word. Amen. We greet you
[39:07] all this morning in the lovely name of
[39:10] Jesus Christ. Amen. We have here with us
[39:13] a missionary whom some of you may not
[39:16] know, but it's Brother Null Johnson. And
[39:19] and Brother Null is actually the first
[39:22] brother. He and his wife, Sister
[39:24] Shirley, was the first ones we met when
[39:28] we came from up in Oregon and was headed
[39:32] to Tucson Tabernacle for the first time
[39:34] to meet believers outside of our little
[39:36] group. and brother null. Uh you and your
[39:40] wife took uh my twin brother and I and
[39:44] Mitch Buckingham and I believe Tom
[39:46] Weathers came down uh at that time and
[39:49] you let us sleep outside of your trailer
[39:52] there and uh took care of us. So he was
[39:55] the first one that we had met and so we
[39:58] go back a long ways. Brother Null, I
[40:00] would like you to come up here please
[40:02] and say a few words. He is a missionary
[40:05] that when you talk about a a real
[40:08] missionary, he goes out and um he goes
[40:12] to places like India
[40:14] &gt;&gt; and he goes there for weeks at a time
[40:16] and his schedule is so full that he'll
[40:20] he'll preach 15 times and 10 days or
[40:23] something like that and have train rides
[40:24] and and cars and this and that and uh
[40:28] but a real missionary and some uh time
[40:31] when we get over there into heaven
[40:33] they'll There'll be different ones
[40:35] that'll say, uh, Lord, when did I do
[40:37] this for you? When did, uh, and
[40:40] whatsoever you've done to the least of
[40:42] mine, you've done unto me. I believe
[40:44] that Brother Null is one of those unsung
[40:46] heroes that you may not hear about, but
[40:49] he goes out and wins souls for the glory
[40:50] of God. Brother Null, would you come and
[40:52] greet the saints here this morning? And
[40:55] we greet you and we love you, brother.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Bless you.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; I want to greet you in the name of the
[41:02] Lord Jesus Christ.
[41:04] And it's been my privilege where God
[41:08] allowed me to go to India. Um when after
[41:11] I got there a few times I realized I
[41:13] really don't want to be here.
[41:16] But when I look back over time and I
[41:19] begin to realize it's not about me, it's
[41:21] about him.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; He is the one that has allowed me to go.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; We have been going there this coming
[41:28] January. It'll be 20 years.
[41:31] And I began to look at that and I
[41:33] figured this is this is something and
[41:34] and I asked the Lord I asked the Lord
[41:37] would you allow me one more time just to
[41:40] go back
[41:41] &gt;&gt; to see what he has allowed me to be a
[41:43] part of.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; So we're going to have a short trip. It
[41:46] only be six weeks and uh the biggest
[41:50] thing is just just the air
[41:51] transportation. Sitting in a tin can at
[41:54] 40,000 ft with 400 other people is just
[41:56] not my idea of fun. But yeah,
[41:58] &gt;&gt; anyway, but but but here again, I I I
[42:01] learned a long time ago, it's not about
[42:03] me.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; It's about me listening to him
[42:07] &gt;&gt; and allowing him to direct my life. We
[42:10] now have 340 messages in the Telugu
[42:13] language. I have God has allowed me to
[42:16] help supply them the means whereby they
[42:18] can go and do the I don't speak Telugu.
[42:22] Um I I tried learning it once and I gave
[42:26] up it. It's the most complicated
[42:28] language in the in the ind in India in
[42:31] anyway but like I say we now have 380
[42:35] messages which have been translated into
[42:36] the Telugu language. They're all
[42:38] available to everybody in the world on
[42:40] the hub from Cloverdale.
[42:43] But like I say it when I look back I
[42:45] realized it has been an honor
[42:48] &gt;&gt; for him to allow me to go and to be a
[42:52] part of something greater than myself.
[42:54] I learned a long time ago, it's not
[42:56] about me, it's all about him.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; And but I had to learn how to allow him
[43:01] to direct me.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; And uh like I say, we've had we've had
[43:06] different experiences. I could, you
[43:08] know, I I could anyway, no sense going
[43:10] into details, but like I say, it's just
[43:12] been an honor for me to go and I will
[43:14] look forward to make this one last trip.
[43:17] And somebody else has already supplied
[43:18] the means and everything like that. I'm
[43:20] I'm not asking for anything, but like I
[43:22] say, I just
[43:24] To me, it's a memorial 20 years.
[43:28] And I figured, God, you've been
[43:30] gracious. You've kept me alive. You've
[43:32] allowed me to minister your word to
[43:34] these people. And Lord, I just want one
[43:36] more time. I want to go back and I want
[43:38] to see what you have allowed me to be a
[43:40] part of.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; And God is honoring that. God bless you.
[43:45] [applause]
[43:49] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; I asked brother null I said how old are
[43:56] you? He says 81.
[43:59] Now if you know anything about
[44:02] missionary work and if you know anything
[44:03] about India, India is not a place that
[44:06] you will go for vacation
[44:08] &gt;&gt; and different things and it's rough and
[44:11] he and sister Shirley get on uh those
[44:14] airplanes long distance and if any of
[44:17] you have got his email where he sends
[44:20] you a little brief uh
[44:23] report of where he's at and what he's
[44:25] doing and I you know I flew over and we
[44:28] got into Madros and we did this and and
[44:32] etc etc and you find out all the
[44:35] hardships six weeks six weeks 81 years
[44:39] of age and he said just let me go one
[44:42] more time I it reminds me of that sermon
[44:45] brother Brennham says just once more
[44:47] Lord
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen and just go to go do something for
[44:51] the kingdom of God he's not going there
[44:54] for vacation it's rough in fact when you
[44:56] get home that's when you need some rest
[44:59] and recuperation. [laughter] That's
[45:02] true. Amen. And um I want to say thank
[45:06] you to all of you for cards, letters,
[45:08] and your minister appreciation day. God
[45:11] bless you richly. I uh don't feel I
[45:14] deserve that, but God bless you for your
[45:16] efforts. Let's stand together.
[45:19] Let's sing. Let's sing the brother
[45:23] Brandham called it our theme song. And
[45:25] he said, "I've
[45:27] sang that song around the world. Only
[45:31] believe."
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Thousands of times,
[45:47] the prophet would come out
[45:50] to this song.
[45:55] a vindicated messenger
[45:58] &gt;&gt; with a message upon his heart.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; He said the angel told him, he said, "As
[46:05] Moses was given two signs, you're going
[46:07] to be given two signs.
[46:10] And if you'll get the people to believe,
[46:15] &gt;&gt; there's something in the heart of every
[46:18] elect seed that has the ability
[46:22] &gt;&gt; to hear what that messenger is saying.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; You are actually a recipient.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; You are able to hear
[46:32] &gt;&gt; what others cannot. They have ears to
[46:34] hear, but they hear not. They have eyes
[46:37] to see,
[46:38] &gt;&gt; but they see not. But blessed are your
[46:40] ears, and blessed are your eyes.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; And as we sing this song, let's just
[46:45] take a moment and thank God for what
[46:47] he's done
[46:48] &gt;&gt; in this our generation. And most of all,
[46:51] not only for what he's done, but what
[46:52] he's doing.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; And that we're a part of it.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. Holy [singing]
[47:01] be,
[47:05] &gt;&gt; only
[47:07] be
[47:12] all [singing] things are possible.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Only [chant]
[47:21] believe.
[47:24] Only [singing]
[47:27] believe.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Only
[47:33] believe. [singing]
[47:37] All things are [singing]
[47:40] possible.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Only
[47:46] believe.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's just remain
[47:50] standing. Thank you, musicians. Amen.
[47:53] Let's turn in your Bibles please to
[47:56] Matthew 12
[47:58] 28- 29. Then we'll [snorts] go to
[48:01] Revelation 2.
[48:11] Now I want to say this as we begin the
[48:15] service.
[48:17] There are times
[48:19] in which you as a minister are deeply
[48:22] moved upon, profoundly moved.
[48:26] And I want to say this is one of the
[48:28] times.
[48:30] Uh this may be a pastoral declaration,
[48:37] a personal declaration
[48:40] of what I have become a witness to see
[48:44] and to hear within
[48:46] this message.
[48:49] And uh so I I would like all of your
[48:53] undivided attention this morning to
[48:56] listen and listen carefully.
[49:00] I want to measure every word.
[49:03] I want God to speak to every heart.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to just be a spectator.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; I want you to get in the game.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; If I use that terminology, I don't want
[49:18] you to just sit here and watch.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; I want you to get into it.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; This message is not for you to just
[49:26] repeat like a parrot.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. and say it.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; But to actually let the message come
[49:34] into your being
[49:36] &gt;&gt; because the message, brother Brennham
[49:38] said, is Christ.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; And when Christ comes in
[49:47] &gt;&gt; when he comes in, [snorts]
[49:49] &gt;&gt; he does something for you.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; And he begins to reveal himself. Brother
[49:54] Brennham said, "One of the three-fold
[49:55] purpose of God is that he might reveal
[49:59] himself to his people."
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 12 verses 28 and 29.
[50:10] [snorts]
[50:16] Wherefore
[50:18] we receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[50:20] moved,
[50:22] let us have grace by we may serve God
[50:26] acceptably
[50:28] with reverence and godly fear.
[50:32] For our God
[50:34] is a consuming fire.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; For our God
[50:42] is a consuming fire. Turn with me to the
[50:45] book of Revelation, chapter 2,
[50:53] verses 1-7.
[50:58] Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus,
[51:01] write
[51:03] these things saith he that holdeth the
[51:05] seven stars in his right hand, who
[51:08] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[51:10] candlesticks.
[51:12] I know thy works and thy labor, and thy
[51:15] patience, and how thou canst not bear
[51:18] with them which are evil.
[51:21] Thou hast tried them which say they are
[51:24] apostles, and are not, and hast found
[51:26] them liars,
[51:29] and hast borne, and hast patience,
[51:32] and for my name's sake hast labored, and
[51:35] hast not fainted. Nevertheless, I have
[51:38] somewhat against thee,
[51:40] because thou hast left thy first love.
[51:47] Remember, therefore, from whence thou
[51:48] art fallen, and repent, and do the first
[51:53] works, or else I will come unto thee
[51:55] quickly, and will remove thy candlestick
[51:58] out of his place, except thou repent.
[52:03] But this thou hast,
[52:06] which thou hatest the deeds of the
[52:08] nicicoatans,
[52:10] which I also
[52:12] hate.
[52:14] He that hath an ear, let him hear what
[52:16] the spirit saith unto the churches.
[52:19] And [snorts] to him that overcomemeth
[52:20] while I grant to eat of the tree of
[52:23] life, which is in the midst of the
[52:25] paradise of God. Amen. May God bless the
[52:29] reading of his word. You may be seated
[52:30] this morning in [snorts] the presence of
[52:33] the Lord.
[52:40] I would like to continue on with my
[52:42] thought this morning
[52:46] of from form unto fire. This is part
[52:50] two. I will have another part of this
[52:55] that I probably will preach on this
[52:58] coming Sunday. Now, I was supposed to
[53:00] leave on Thursday to go to uh to go to
[53:05] Florida to preach for brother Keith
[53:07] Brown. And due to all the complications
[53:10] with the government shutdown and planes
[53:12] cancelling and all of this stuff, it's
[53:15] becomes, you know, so uh hectic that I
[53:19] just called brother Brown this morning
[53:22] and I told him I said, "Brother Brown, I
[53:26] if you don't mind, I don't feel that
[53:28] it's conducive to try to travel this
[53:31] weekend. Even if we got there, we may
[53:33] not get home. I mean, everything's
[53:35] shutting down.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, you know, it's actually Brother
[53:38] Bram's fault.
[53:41] I blame him because he said the whole
[53:42] world's falling apart. And when a
[53:44] prophet speaks something, it just comes
[53:46] to pass. It's all falling apart. America
[53:49] is coming uh uh, you know, it's coming
[53:52] apart at the seams. And just about the
[53:55] time you think that the left has gotten
[53:57] so far left, they can't get any more
[53:59] left, then there's a another left
[54:02] movement that gets even worse. And you
[54:04] see what's happening with New York City
[54:06] and you uh different things. Well, hey,
[54:09] don't don't Hey, listen. Uh I'm glad
[54:12] that God's got everything under control.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; These things have got to come to pass.
[54:16] So, we're not worried about it. We're
[54:18] not going to uh fuss over it. We're not
[54:20] preaching politics because we're not
[54:22] politicians. We're Christians.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; We love God with all our heart. Amen.
[54:26] So, I would like to take the subject
[54:28] this morning of refueling the fire.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; And I'll continue on with this thought.
[54:34] Now, in order to give you a little bit
[54:36] of a background of how the Lord has been
[54:39] dealing with me even in the last couple
[54:42] weeks, um the wife and I and having our
[54:46] morning devotions,
[54:48] um and we're reading, we were reading uh
[54:52] from our Bibles first and then go to the
[54:54] seven church age book and we read, she
[54:57] reads a paragraph, I read a paragraph
[54:59] and so on.
[55:01] And in reading um in the Ephesian church
[55:05] age, I was overcome. I I I I came to
[55:11] actually
[55:13] became so distraught of seeing what was
[55:17] happening to the Ephesian church age
[55:20] &gt;&gt; that I I I began to weep. Brother Bram
[55:22] said, "Watch." He says here in the very
[55:25] Ephesian church age, the church, the
[55:28] first church age, the one that saw
[55:30] Pentecost,
[55:31] &gt;&gt; the one that had the disciples
[55:34] preaching, the one that had the great
[55:37] move of God and within uh a span of
[55:41] about 50 years already, wolves in
[55:43] sheep's clothing, false prophets, false
[55:46] teachers, Himenias and Phileitas have
[55:50] come in and said the resurrection's
[55:51] already passed and all kinds and made
[55:54] shipwreck of of different believers.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; And
[56:00] then as we begin to go through this and
[56:03] and brother Brennham says that God had a
[56:06] complaint there with Ephesus because
[56:08] thou was left your first love. Imagine
[56:12] &gt;&gt; the very first church age that saw all
[56:16] of this, the great supernatural.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. And yet Ephesus means relaxed.
[56:24] They just began to get a little relaxed.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, my brother, my
[56:29] sister, and we get a little relaxed in
[56:31] the comforts of Laia and the pressures
[56:34] and this and that and your job and your
[56:37] family and this and that. And what it
[56:40] does, it has an effect upon you.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you're not careful, you've
[56:45] got to refuel the fire because a fire
[56:48] consumes.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; And it'll go out if you don't refuel it.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; So it's not just one baptism of the Holy
[57:00] Ghost. Brother Bram said, baptism after
[57:02] baptism,
[57:04] &gt;&gt; but line upon line, precept upon
[57:07] precept.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; God dealing with you. He started the
[57:10] work in you and he will finish that work
[57:12] in you.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Now to just give you and I'm going to
[57:16] read this quote over again and then I'm
[57:19] going to read from the seven church age
[57:22] book uh for just a moment if you all
[57:25] don't mind to give you a little bit of a
[57:27] background of what I began to see within
[57:32] the church age book. Brother Brenham
[57:34] said uh in the Ephesian church age that
[57:38] cycle of revival and death has never
[57:41] failed.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; So now brother Brenham said I'm a
[57:45] typologist. I look and I see what
[57:47] happened.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; As it was
[57:50] &gt;&gt; shall it.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; So shall it be.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; If you want to know what will be look
[57:55] what has been.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:58] So he says the cycle of revival and
[58:01] death has never failed.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is recall this move
[58:08] of God in the spirit when men and women
[58:11] dressed like Christians, went to church,
[58:13] prayed all night, took to the street
[58:15] corners, and weren't ashamed of the
[58:17] manifestations of the spirit. They left
[58:20] their old dead churches and worshiped in
[58:23] homes and old store buildings.
[58:26] and they had reality.
[58:29] But it wasn't too long a time until they
[58:32] began to get enough money to build find
[58:35] new churches.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; They put in a a choir instead of singing
[58:41] unto God for themselves.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; And may I say this as a pastor, I don't
[58:46] want all of you to watch the song leader
[58:50] lead songs. And I don't want you to sit
[58:52] there and not get involved. Come on.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Now, if you want to see whether or not
[58:58] you're involved, go look at our archive
[59:01] and see if you're sitting or clapping or
[59:03] even opening your mouth.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Take that as a rebuke if you wish. But I
[59:10] I want all of you I don't want uh just
[59:12] you sitting there like this and you're
[59:15] observing. I want you to get into it.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; That's good, brother.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to get into it. I want
[59:22] you, IF YOU'RE SINGING ABOUT GOD, I WANT
[59:24] YOU TO SING. I WANT YOU TO GET YOUR
[59:27] VOICE BEHIND IT.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; I want you to get involved.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not doing this for man.
[59:32] You're doing it FOR GOD. AND IF ANY OF
[59:34] YOU,
[59:35] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. SOMEBODY SAY, "AMEN."
[59:37] THAT'S TRUE. YOU'RE NOT DOING IT for
[59:39] man. I'm doing it for him.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; IF I'M GOING TO BE A FOOL, LET ME BE A
[59:42] FOOL FOR CHRIST.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.
[59:48] They got gowns on the choir and they
[59:50] organized a movement and ran it by man.
[59:55] [snorts] They soon began to read books
[59:57] that weren't fit to read. They went down
[1:00:00] to the bars and goats, excuse me, they
[1:00:03] let down the bars and goats came in and
[1:00:06] took over. The cry of joy was gone.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; The freedom of the spirit was gone.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, they kept on with the form.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:15] So now they they kept on with a form and
[1:00:18] I started with from fire to form.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Now I don't want to leave you on a
[1:00:27] negative.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; But I want to go from form unto fire.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:35] They kept on with a form, but the fire
[1:00:38] had died down and the blackness of ashes
[1:00:42] is about all that is left.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Now, I must admit that this issue of the
[1:00:49] cycle of revival and death has never
[1:00:52] failed is an issue that is of grave
[1:00:56] concern for me, not only as a pastor,
[1:01:00] but as an elder within the message.
[1:01:03] Amen.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; It only takes a simple glance as a
[1:01:07] minister to visit churches and you begin
[1:01:10] to see formalism.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; You begin to see uh religious ways.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; You begin to see that that we if we're
[1:01:21] not too careful, we become regimented.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; We sing so many song specials and and
[1:01:27] this and that. We change the order of
[1:01:29] the service and people are not pulling.
[1:01:31] They're they're not seeking God. Oh, my
[1:01:34] brother, my sister, there's nothing
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; as a minister that I enjoy better
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; that I desire more. And that is when
[1:01:43] you're praying at home
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; and when you're seeking God in your
[1:01:47] prayer closet and there in my home, God
[1:01:52] begins to just take my mind
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; and permeate IT FULL OF YOUR REQUESTS of
[1:01:59] your needs and the things that are on
[1:02:02] your heart AND GOD BEGINS TO ACTIVATE
[1:02:05] THAT GIFT. BECAUSE BROTHER RAM SAID, "NO
[1:02:07] MATTER HOW MUCH I HAVE THE ANOINTING AND
[1:02:10] HAVE A WORD ON my heart, IF YOU'RE NOT
[1:02:12] PULLING," HE SAID, "THE words fall in
[1:02:15] front of the pulpit."
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; I SAY, "MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, I NEED
[1:02:19] YOUR HELP.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; I CANNOT DO it alone.
[1:02:25] Hey,
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; this effect
[1:02:31] of revival and death
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; is not only happening locally
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; but globally.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; It has become viral.
[1:02:42] And I wish to
[1:02:44] empty my heart this morning as a pastor
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; and as a minister of this gospel that
[1:02:53] concerns me.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; And I want you to bear with me this
[1:02:58] morning if you would please. Amen.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; And
[1:03:06] this issue
[1:03:08] is something that has not just started
[1:03:12] in the last couple weeks.
[1:03:15] In fact, it was just after I had come
[1:03:19] into the message and I'd only been in it
[1:03:22] a few months and I already saw within
[1:03:25] the little group that I came into the
[1:03:27] message with how the divisions
[1:03:32] and interpretations.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and opinions
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; uh came in and how the different ones
[1:03:43] wanted to rise up and and control the
[1:03:46] group or or to say which way we were
[1:03:50] going to go and that sort of thing. And
[1:03:52] we were just listening to tapes. We
[1:03:54] didn't have a minister. We were just
[1:03:57] listening to tapes. And listening to
[1:03:59] tapes is wonderful. Praise God for that.
[1:04:03] But there must be a five-fold ministry
[1:04:05] that says to get into this.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; God has ordained them to go into this
[1:04:11] message
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; and then feed it to your people.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says, and I just
[1:04:17] reiterate to you, all of those who go
[1:04:20] out do not uh have the revelation or the
[1:04:25] understanding to say only what that
[1:04:28] prophet messenger has said.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he said they begin to add
[1:04:32] their interpretation, their opinion,
[1:04:34] their own ideas uh to the message and it
[1:04:38] longer is pure and it becomes hybrid.
[1:04:40] And when you hybrid something, it cannot
[1:04:43] reproduce itself to the original. That's
[1:04:45] why I say stay with that original.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; SAY WHAT THAT PROPHET SAID. STAY WITH
[1:04:51] THE BIBLE.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; YES SIR. that is our absolute.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; But when the ministry becomes
[1:04:59] uh compromising
[1:05:01] and relaxed and no longer preaches
[1:05:04] against sin,
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; it has a trickle down effect
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; to the congregation
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; because if the ministry compromises the
[1:05:16] congregation will also. Amen.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; So
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; now I told the brethren that I'm going
[1:05:24] to read from the seven church age book.
[1:05:26] I gave them they went ahead and took a
[1:05:28] photo copy of it. I said I didn't cut
[1:05:30] and paste and send it to them. So I
[1:05:33] don't know if they can follow me. Uh
[1:05:35] that's fine if they don't. Now this
[1:05:37] happens to be the seven church age book
[1:05:40] that George Smith had uh printed and its
[1:05:44] pages and paragraphing is different than
[1:05:47] the seven church age book from uh voice
[1:05:50] of God and he did that purposely so he
[1:05:53] could print it and they could not stop
[1:05:56] him because they said we have a
[1:05:58] copyright on that. So he changed the
[1:06:01] format. So but the wording is the same.
[1:06:05] So, I told the brethren, if you don't
[1:06:07] mind, and I'll just use some of these
[1:06:11] reading glasses
[1:06:13] here to be able to read it properly and
[1:06:17] not guess at the wording.
[1:06:20] Okay,
[1:06:22] brother Brennham says here, to
[1:06:25] understand this, you must realize that
[1:06:27] the spirit is not speaking to the
[1:06:30] original saints of Ephesus alone.
[1:06:34] Amen.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Do do we have it up here? Okay.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; All right. So, just follow along with
[1:06:39] me. And if I make an error, just you
[1:06:42] pray for me because I'm over 70 and
[1:06:44] sometimes it just doesn't. This message
[1:06:48] is to the entire age which lasted about
[1:06:52] 120 years. Its message re uh
[1:06:57] its message then is to all the
[1:06:59] generations in that span. Now history
[1:07:02] keeps repeating itself.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; In the generations of Israel, we see
[1:07:08] revival in one generation only to the
[1:07:10] sea the fires fading in the next. In the
[1:07:14] third generation, embers may be glowing
[1:07:16] slightly, but in the fourth there may be
[1:07:18] no vestage whatsoever of that original
[1:07:21] flame. Oh God.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; I began to read this and I said, and
[1:07:27] even as my wife and I were reading this,
[1:07:29] I said, "Oh God,
[1:07:32] I said, "Look at this." He's showing
[1:07:34] history repeating itself.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Now, please again, bear with me as as I
[1:07:41] as I tell you what concerns me.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Then God lights the fire again and the
[1:07:52] same process is repeated.
[1:07:55] It is simply the manifestation of the
[1:07:57] truth that God has no grandchildren.
[1:08:01] Hallelujah.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Salvation is not passed on by natural
[1:08:05] birth.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; No, sir. Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Any more than there's any truth to
[1:08:10] apostolic succession. It isn't in the
[1:08:14] word.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Understand that you may be born to
[1:08:19] born again
[1:08:21] Christian family members. Your mom and
[1:08:24] dad may have salvation.
[1:08:26] And because you were born in that family
[1:08:29] does not mean you got salvation. YOU
[1:08:33] MUST COME THE SAME way they came.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; He that hath THE SON HATH LIFE. HE THAT
[1:08:40] HATH NOT THE SON HATH NOT LIFE.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; EVERY MAN MUST BE BORN AGAIN. THEY MUST
[1:08:46] WORK OUT YOUR OWN SALVATION WITH FEAR
[1:08:48] AND TREMBLING. IT DOESN'T COME TO YOU
[1:08:51] JUST BECAUSE YOUR parents are believers.
[1:08:53] YOU, I ASK YOU, DO YOU BELIEVE?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Good question.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; You start out with truly born again
[1:09:04] believers and when the next generation
[1:09:06] comes along, they no longer just plain
[1:09:08] Christians, but they have taken a
[1:09:11] denominational name and are now Baptists
[1:09:14] and Methodists, etc. That's exactly what
[1:09:16] they are, too. They are not Christians.
[1:09:20] You have to be born of the will of God,
[1:09:23] not the will of man to be saved. But
[1:09:26] these folks are all coming together now
[1:09:28] by the will of man. I don't say that
[1:09:31] some of them aren't right with God. Not
[1:09:33] for a minute do I say that. But the
[1:09:35] original fire has died down. They are
[1:09:39] not the same anymore. The fervent desire
[1:09:42] to please God, the passion to know his
[1:09:45] word for the cry for reaching out in the
[1:09:48] spirit all begins to fade and instead of
[1:09:50] that church being on fire with the fire
[1:09:52] of God, it has cooled off and it become
[1:09:56] a bit formal. And I began to as we were
[1:09:59] reading this, I began to feel it.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not just reading this, but it's
[1:10:06] having an effect.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Cooling off and becoming a bit formal.
[1:10:15] That is what's happening back there in
[1:10:16] the Ephesians. They were getting a bit
[1:10:18] formal. The abandonment to God was dying
[1:10:21] out. And the people weren't too careful
[1:10:24] about what God thought of them as they
[1:10:26] began to to be careful about what the
[1:10:29] world thought of them.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Who cares what the world thinks?
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PLEASE THE WORLD,
[1:10:35] YOU CANNOT PLEASE GOD.
[1:10:37] TO BE CARNALLY MINDED IS ENMITY WITH
[1:10:40] GOD.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; To follow CHRIST IS TO DIE to self.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, people will hate
[1:10:46] you
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; for being a Christian.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid of taking sides with
[1:10:53] Jesus.
[1:10:56] [snorts]
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; I don't care.
[1:11:00] You know, you see all of the headlines
[1:11:01] of these movie stars and actors and rock
[1:11:05] and roll people and they say, "Well,
[1:11:08] about this and about that." Who cares?
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; They're nothing but a bunch of actors.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; They're a bunch of heathens, a bunch of
[1:11:16] Jezebels.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; That's plain.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. If if you're going to hear about
[1:11:21] the age, listen to what THE PROPHET OF
[1:11:23] GOD had to say. Because the spirit WAS
[1:11:26] USING HIM. HE WAS THE MESSENGER
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD WAS USING TO TELL THIS THIS
[1:11:31] GENERATION,
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; GET RIGHT WITH GOD. GET BACK TO THE
[1:11:35] WORD.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Thank you, Lord.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; That second generation coming on was
[1:11:42] just like Israel. They demanded a king
[1:11:45] to be like the other nations.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; When when they did that, THEY REJECTED
[1:11:51] GOD. BUT THEY did it anyway.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; That is history of the church. Yeah.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; When it thinks more of conforming to the
[1:11:58] world instead of conforming to God, it
[1:12:01] isn't long until you see them stop doing
[1:12:04] things they used to do, start doing
[1:12:07] things they wouldn't do initially. They
[1:12:10] change their manner of dress. Watch the
[1:12:12] three examples. They change their manner
[1:12:15] of dress, their attitude, and their
[1:12:19] behavior.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; They get laxed. That is what Ephesus
[1:12:25] means. relaxed,
[1:12:27] drifting,
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; they change their manner of dress,
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; their attitude and their behavior.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; I, as a pastor, see it.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; I see the dress when it begins to no
[1:12:43] longer have a way of holiness about it.
[1:12:47] But you see the the ways of the world
[1:12:51] and worldly dress. And brother Brennham
[1:12:55] says, "Watch the women because they're
[1:12:57] an indication of the church."
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Not that you're attacking the women.
[1:13:02] Sisters, understand this,
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; but he says, "When I look at the woman,
[1:13:07] I'm looking at the man whom she
[1:13:09] reflects.
[1:13:11] And when I see formalism and I see more
[1:13:15] uh care about women wanting to be more
[1:13:17] fashionable and high heel shoes and and
[1:13:22] uh low neck uh dresses and slinky uh
[1:13:27] wiener SKIN DOWN TYPE DRESS. I DON'T
[1:13:30] CARE if it's long.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; IF YOU WERE POURED INTO IT, SOMETHING'S
[1:13:34] WRONG.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; THERE SHOULD be a holiness.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Preach, brother. Amen.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; That cycle of revival and death has
[1:13:46] never failed. I'm going to bypass that
[1:13:51] and go to paragraph 91. A few moments
[1:13:55] ago, I mentioned that John understood
[1:13:58] what it was to love God. That great
[1:14:00] apostle of love would certainly see it
[1:14:03] when the church began to lose that first
[1:14:05] love of God. He quotes then from 1 John
[1:14:09] 5:3. For this is the love of God that we
[1:14:11] keep his commandments, his word.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; One little deviation from that word has
[1:14:17] to step away from Christ.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; People say they love God. They go to
[1:14:22] church. They even shout and rejoice and
[1:14:24] sing and have a great emotional time.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; But when it's all over, watch and see if
[1:14:30] they are in that word,
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; walking in it.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Living in it.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. If they go through all the other
[1:14:38] and don't walk in that word, they can
[1:14:41] say they love God, but their lives
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; tell another story.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, what does your life
[1:14:47] tell me?
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Good question.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; What does your life tell me?
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; What is your Facebook, your Instagram?
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Who do you befriend? You got more
[1:15:02] friends of the world than you do within
[1:15:04] the church. I say something's wrong
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; again. I told you it's going to be a
[1:15:13] pastoral message.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; I wonder if John didn't see of that
[1:15:21] before he died.
[1:15:23] People saying they love God but not
[1:15:25] obeying his word. Oh, Ephesian church,
[1:15:27] something is happening to you. Someone's
[1:15:30] trying to either add to that word or
[1:15:32] take away from it, but they're doing it
[1:15:34] so subtly they can't see it. They
[1:15:37] haven't made a move so big
[1:15:41] you can see it there in the open. It's
[1:15:44] undercover and they are bringing it in a
[1:15:48] way of reason and human understanding
[1:15:51] and we'll take over unless you refuse
[1:15:53] it. go back to pick Pentecost
[1:15:57] before it's too late.
[1:16:02] [snorts]
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Now, let me reiterate
[1:16:09] again that this is not something that
[1:16:12] just all of a sudden I got this epiphany
[1:16:15] a week or two ago.
[1:16:17] I became aware of this when I was 18
[1:16:20] years old, just months within the
[1:16:23] message.
[1:16:26] And when I began to see men adding to
[1:16:29] and taking away from the message, I was
[1:16:32] zealous for it then, and I'm zealous for
[1:16:34] it now.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:42] And
[1:16:46] I began to see the side effects
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; in German.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; When you take a prescription, it has
[1:16:55] side effects.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; What's amazing is you need XYZ to take
[1:17:03] care of your arthritis. But if you have
[1:17:05] heart problems, if you have diarrhea, if
[1:17:07] you have this and that, if you have low
[1:17:09] blood sugar and
[1:17:12] do not take it
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; because the effects of it may be worse
[1:17:16] than what you're trying,
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; okay, help me. Help me, Lord.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; So this awareness of the effects
[1:17:34] of lowering standards and compromising
[1:17:36] on the word of God is consuming me.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it overwhelms me.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think I'm done. I quit.
[1:18:05] It's not that I have left the love of
[1:18:09] God or
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; I want to go into the world. No, I would
[1:18:14] say, okay, hey, I believe this message
[1:18:16] and I got no problem with it. It's I got
[1:18:19] problems with you guys.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; And I I'm going to share something very
[1:18:28] deeply with you.
[1:18:35] When I see these effects, I see it not
[1:18:38] only within the local church, but within
[1:18:41] our own personal lives. I want to I want
[1:18:44] to reach to where you're living. I want
[1:18:46] to come to your address.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; This letter has got your name on it.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Part of the curse of Ladya is easy
[1:18:57] living.
[1:19:00] Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; We have need of nothing.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; It's too easy to become lax,
[1:19:09] slackful,
[1:19:11] no longer fervent for something. And
[1:19:14] actually, brother null, you're 81 years
[1:19:17] of age. Why haven't you slowed down?
[1:19:22] And instead of six weeks in India, why
[1:19:25] don't you make it six days?
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Go ahead.
[1:19:30] Because hey, I'll tell you what, follow
[1:19:33] his schedule and see what he preaches.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; My goodness. What I'm saying
[1:19:40] is a lot of times I as a minister, I
[1:19:42] say, Lord,
[1:19:46] even how hard I preach
[1:19:48] and how much I try to make the people
[1:19:51] understand.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; I see people getting laxed.
[1:19:56] I see
[1:19:58] I see the ways of the world coming in
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; and honestly
[1:20:07] I take it personal
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; when I begin to see the church become
[1:20:14] cold and formal and not pulling. I take
[1:20:18] it personal.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; HOW ELSE can I take it? Come on.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; But in my consecration, in my prayer
[1:20:25] closet before God, God came and gave me
[1:20:29] some soloulless to my heart and said,
[1:20:31] "You cannot make the foolish wise."
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Don't take it personal.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Did not SAMUEL SAY, "THEY'VE REJECTED
[1:20:45] ME."
[1:20:49] And God had to come telling me,
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Samuel, it's not you they rejected.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; It's me they rejected.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Give them a king.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; And especially as I get older, I become
[1:21:07] a little bit battleweary.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Why fight,
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; man? Let's go on R&R.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:21:19] Amen.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; But the flashing red lights of the
[1:21:24] warnings that I saw years ago has now
[1:21:28] become blaring sirens of warning like a
[1:21:32] tsunami that's coming and and there's a
[1:21:35] tsunami warning
[1:21:39] and it gets louder and it's continuous.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:44] Are any of you aware
[1:21:46] of all of the flashing red lights and
[1:21:49] the signs of warning?
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; OH, I PRAY THAT THE FERANCY THAT YOU
[1:21:55] HAVE FOR GOD IS NOT BECOMING LAX,
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE REFUELING THE FIREMEN.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; DON'T ALLOW YOURSELF TO BECOME
[1:22:04] COMPLACENT.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; GET IN THE GAME.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS YOUR MESSAGE. THIS
[1:22:11] MESSAGE WAS ORDAINED TO BRING YOU BACK
[1:22:14] TO WHERE YOU BEGAN.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; IS YOUR DESTINY.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Thank you, Lord.
[1:22:29] [snorts]
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord. as a military general trains
[1:22:37] his troops to go to war. And he he's got
[1:22:41] to put them through the time of going
[1:22:44] through boot camp and training and rough
[1:22:47] and crawl on the ground and live
[1:22:49] ammunition. HE'S GOT TO TRY TO simulate
[1:22:52] war
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; because he tells them war is hell.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Some of you ain't coming back.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:05] So when he leads his men into battle,
[1:23:09] they have casualties.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; And every general when he sees the
[1:23:15] casualties of the men whom he's led, who
[1:23:19] he he knew who were comrade in arms.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; And he see him carried out on a
[1:23:26] stretcher.
[1:23:30] HOW CAN HE NOT FEEL INVOLVED?
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; I SAW A DOCUMENTARY the other day.
[1:23:36] Excuse me. To just make a little detour
[1:23:39] a moment [snorts]
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; because we see the anti-semitism coming
[1:23:44] up now in this age against the Jews
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; and against Christians. What's happening
[1:23:49] in Nigeria,
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; and the different countries around the
[1:23:53] world are only little warnings.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Warnings.
[1:23:58] How did the Holocaust happen? How did 6
[1:24:01] million Jews I've been in
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Ashvitz?
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; The name of the city in Polish is
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Oensham,
[1:24:09] but the but the Germans changed it to
[1:24:12] Ashvitz.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; I've been there. I've seen the
[1:24:16] crematoriums.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; I've been there. HOW COULD THIS
[1:24:19] HOLOCAUST TAKE PLACE JUST BECAUSE THEY
[1:24:23] WERE JEWS,
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE THEY DID SOMETHING WRONG.
[1:24:26] NOT BECAUSE THEY were murderers and
[1:24:28] liars,
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; They were Jews.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; That spirit's rising up again.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It is.
[1:24:38] And I happened to see a a small clip of
[1:24:43] of Liam Niss
[1:24:47] was in a movie called Schindler's List
[1:24:51] and they were asking the man who was the
[1:24:54] producer and excuse me I don't remember
[1:24:56] their names [snorts]
[1:24:59] but they said that the just the remaking
[1:25:03] of it to make it similar
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; to what they went through the people
[1:25:09] that were doing the filming,
[1:25:12] the actors and everything began to have
[1:25:15] nervous breakdowns,
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; began to have mental problems because
[1:25:21] COULD THIS REALLY HAPPENED?
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; COME ON. YEAH.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; ALL THEY WERE DOING IS REENACTING,
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; MAKING IT look like what really
[1:25:30] happened.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:33] And there was one part of the
[1:25:35] documentary
[1:25:36] that was amazing
[1:25:40] because
[1:25:42] and this was not scripted.
[1:25:45] This was off script.
[1:25:48] Liam Nissan, who was Schindler, who was
[1:25:52] trying to save as many Jews as he could
[1:25:56] and the children, and he his wealth he
[1:26:00] he poured into all kinds of schemes and
[1:26:04] things to be able to to get them and
[1:26:06] PROTECT THEM AND SAVE as many as he
[1:26:09] could.
[1:26:13] And when he kind of come to the end of
[1:26:15] his money and the end of his ability,
[1:26:21] Liam Niss
[1:26:23] had a breakdown on the set
[1:26:28] off script
[1:26:30] and he became Schindler
[1:26:34] in spirit and he said, "Oh,
[1:26:38] if I WOULD HAVE SOLD SOLD MY CAR.
[1:26:41] IF I WOULD HAVE SOLD A FEW MORE THINGS,
[1:26:43] I WOULD HAVE GOT ONE MORE.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; I WOULD HAVE SAVED just one more.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; And did they cut it out of the film? No.
[1:26:57] They said that's what made the film.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; OFF SCRIPT, HE JUST BEGAN to say, "IF I
[1:27:03] COULD HAVE DONE [screaming] SOMETHING
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; TO SAVE ONE MORE,
[1:27:09] My
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; you see when you begin to lose good men
[1:27:17] and you [snorts] see the casualties
[1:27:18] happening within the church when
[1:27:20] families leave the message.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; As a minister I carry woundings.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; I take it personal.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; I didn't preach hard enough. I didn't
[1:27:34] preach good enough.
[1:27:36] I didn't preach it simple enough. Why
[1:27:39] did they leave?
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; It's my fault.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, if I could have done better.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; If I'd have been a better pastor if we'd
[1:27:47] had more services.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Maybe we ought to go to three services
[1:27:51] on Sunday instead of just one.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Do you Do you see what I'm saying?
[1:27:55] There's things that I I take it I take
[1:27:57] it personally
[1:28:03] because the loss of every man or woman
[1:28:06] or child or family
[1:28:09] that a pastor loses, you take it
[1:28:11] personal. How could a general not take
[1:28:13] it?
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; These were good men.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think of Moses in the
[1:28:22] first Exodus. No matter how vindicated
[1:28:25] he was of God, he had Dayan and Cora
[1:28:27] rise up against him.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; And he WENT BEFORE GOD. WHY HAVE YOU
[1:28:35] SENT ME?
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Take my life. Don't bring them to
[1:28:41] judgment. He stood in the gap. Was he
[1:28:44] not feeling
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; for the people? And then he took it
[1:28:47] personal
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; just as Joshua
[1:28:54] when they started losing battles, he
[1:28:56] took it PERSONAL AND HE FELL ON HIS FACE
[1:28:58] BEFORE GOD.
[1:29:03] He wept over the loss of men.
[1:29:07] The Apostle Paul did the same thing. He
[1:29:10] began to say, "All men have forsaken me.
[1:29:13] Yeah.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; I'm not shun to declare unto them the
[1:29:17] whole council of God.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; But doors are closing to me
[1:29:25] just as the prophet.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; One time he lost the feeling for the
[1:29:31] people. What What good is it?
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; All the sermons I've preached.
[1:29:35] Everything I've said, all of the
[1:29:37] sleepless nights, all of the flying in
[1:29:40] an aluminum tube at 40,000 ft.
[1:29:44] Huh?
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; It's not vacation.
[1:29:47] [snorts]
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; The very ones that sponsored and
[1:29:52] supported him and his early ministry now
[1:29:55] denied him,
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; rejected him,
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; took their support away, and they closed
[1:30:01] every door.
[1:30:03] And there was just a handful of
[1:30:04] believers around the world that
[1:30:06] recognized there was something special
[1:30:08] about his ministry.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Went from hundreds of thousands down to
[1:30:15] just handfuls.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; No wonder Brother Brennham had to be
[1:30:24] transported beyond the curtain of time.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; What what what good is my ministry?
[1:30:31] all of this and all the preaching and
[1:30:32] all of the prayer lines and all of the
[1:30:35] things that I've done.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Oh my, where are they?
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; God said, "Hey, Elijah, can I take you
[1:30:45] beyond the curtain of time for a
[1:30:46] moment?"
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "I want to show you. You want
[1:30:49] to see the effects of your ministry?"
[1:30:51] Yes.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; He He said,
[1:30:56] "These are all yours."
[1:30:58] He said, "Are they Branoms?" He said,
[1:31:01] "No,
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; no, they're not Branoms."
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "Those are your converts."
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you, how many of you
[1:31:11] say, "I'm a convert of Malachi 4."
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Then who did he see?
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, BROTHER.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; HE SAW YOU BEFORE YOU WERE BORN. AMEN.
[1:31:25] AMEN.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; HE SAW YOU BEFORE YOU CAME INTO THE
[1:31:28] MESSAGE.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; He saw you WHEN YOU WERE STILL A RE
[1:31:33] RICKY OR A
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; REQUETTA.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHY GOD HAD TO HAVE THE PROPHET
[1:31:40] to quit saying Ricky and Retta AND GET
[1:31:43] SO WHY? BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THEM.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; ME TOO, BROTHER.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU EVER GET SO SELF-RIGHTEOUS
[1:31:50] THAT YOU LOOK DOWN YOUR NOSE AT SOMEONE
[1:31:52] ELSE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
[1:31:54] KNOW.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Look at that.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm not like that.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU'D BE WORSE THAN
[1:32:04] THAT
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; IF GOD WOULD HAVE LET YOU KEEP GOING.
[1:32:08] BUT GOD, WHO IS RICH IN MERCY, GOT A
[1:32:11] HOLD OF YOU.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. THANK GOD HE GOT A HOLD OF
[1:32:16] YOU. THANK GOD YOU HEARD THAT VOICE.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Now, let me share something with you
[1:32:30] that I began to see a comparison in this
[1:32:34] age
[1:32:35] [snorts]
[1:32:37] because every true God-given leadership
[1:32:39] stands in the gap for the people. Yes,
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; that's why I covet your prayers.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; God, give us more Aaron and hers that
[1:32:50] lift up the hands of Moses.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; You understand the biblical principle. I
[1:32:56] preached a sermon years ago, hands up,
[1:32:59] hands on, and hands under. Every one of
[1:33:02] you have got a ministry. MAYBE YOUR
[1:33:04] MINISTRY IS ONLY TO PRAY FOR YOUR
[1:33:07] PASTOR. PRAY FOR THE MINISTRY. GOD,
[1:33:09] RAISE HIM UP.
[1:33:11] DON'T LET HIM BECAUSE HE'S THE OX OF THE
[1:33:13] TEAM. BUT IF THE OX of the team IS SO
[1:33:16] OVERBURDENED,
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; IF A NATURAL OX
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; PUT IN THE YOKE
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; AND HE PULLS AND HE STRAINS,
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; until he until he falls under the
[1:33:30] weight,
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; he'll never pull the same again.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; It happened to Elijah.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:44] Brother Bram said he had a nervous
[1:33:45] breakdown. Elijah,
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; God's one man Rambo.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; He had a nervous breakdown.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; You know what God said? There's only a
[1:33:58] couple things that God had Elijah do.
[1:34:02] I I want you to go pray for a little
[1:34:03] couple over here because you know what
[1:34:05] he did? He went off into the desert and
[1:34:07] said, "Oh, God would take my life,
[1:34:11] what good has it done, oh God." And I
[1:34:13] love one of the most amazing quotes that
[1:34:16] Brother Rem said here. Elijah, he's
[1:34:19] having a nervous breakdown. He doesn't
[1:34:21] want to preach no more. He doesn't want
[1:34:23] to go nowhere.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; And he said that God searched through
[1:34:28] all of heaven
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; and found the angel that had the softest
[1:34:32] palm.
[1:34:35] Amen.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; And he had him brush the brow
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; of Elijah.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; All he did was feed him
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; and give him orn for a few times.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; After that, you go look at his ministry.
[1:34:48] He only does a couple more things.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Great ministries
[1:34:53] overburdened.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Have breakdowns.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; I don't want to have a breakdown. I want
[1:34:59] to have a breakthrough.
[1:35:01] Amen.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; So I I I began to see that remember the
[1:35:09] first time that Joshua taking the
[1:35:12] children of Israel across Jordan, the
[1:35:16] first battle they have is the battle of
[1:35:18] Jericho.
[1:35:20] Is that right?
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; And there was Rahab.
[1:35:26] She receives the two messengers. And I'm
[1:35:28] not going to go into Rahab. That's a
[1:35:29] whole another sermon.
[1:35:33] But after
[1:35:35] Jericho, there is another battle that
[1:35:37] they think, "Oh, we don't need to send
[1:35:39] so many men."
[1:35:41] So in Joshua 7, I want you to follow
[1:35:43] along. They gave this to the brethren.
[1:35:45] So we'll read this in Joshua 7. This is
[1:35:48] right after Jericho.
[1:35:50] But the children of Israel committed a
[1:35:52] trespass in the thing. For Achen the son
[1:35:54] of Cari, the son of Zebdi, the son of
[1:35:58] Zarah, of the tribe of Judah, took up
[1:36:01] the thing, and the anger of the Lord was
[1:36:03] kindled against the children of Israel.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; You want to know the problem we got
[1:36:17] today?
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Ai,
[1:36:21] follow along. [laughter]
[1:36:23] uh which is beside Beth even on the east
[1:36:27] side of Betham, spake to them, saying,
[1:36:29] "Go up and view the country." And the
[1:36:31] men went up and viewed Ai. They took a
[1:36:34] look at it. Not so bad. They returned to
[1:36:37] Joshua and said, "Let not all the people
[1:36:40] go up, but let about two or three
[1:36:42] thousand men go up and smite Ai, and
[1:36:45] make not all the people to labor
[1:36:47] thither, for they are but a few." what
[1:36:50] may look like a few, what may look like
[1:36:54] something's innocent,
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; right? Come on,
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; watch the effects.
[1:37:00] So there went up about thither of the
[1:37:03] people about 3,000 men, and they fled
[1:37:05] before the men of Ai.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; And the men of Ai smoked them about 30
[1:37:12] and six men. For they chased them from
[1:37:15] before the gate, even unto
[1:37:19] she baron,
[1:37:21] and smote them in the going down.
[1:37:22] Therefore the hearts of the people
[1:37:24] melted and became as water.
[1:37:27] And Joshua rented Did Did he take it
[1:37:30] personal?
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; He took it so personal he rent his
[1:37:37] clothes
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; and fell on the earth upon his face
[1:37:44] before the ark of the Lord until even
[1:37:47] time. And the elders of Israel put dust
[1:37:50] on their heads. And Joshua said, "Alas,
[1:37:53] oh Lord God, there wherefore hast thou
[1:37:56] at all brought this people over Jordan
[1:38:00] to deliver us into the hand of the
[1:38:01] Amorites to destroy us? Would to God we
[1:38:05] had been content and dwelt ON THE OTHER
[1:38:08] SIDE OF JORDAN."
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, WHAT SHALL I SAY WHEN ISRAEL
[1:38:13] TURNETH their backs before their
[1:38:15] enemies?
[1:38:17] HE TOOK IT PERSONAL.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; I take it personal. Oh God, WHAT DO I
[1:38:22] SAY?
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; WHEN PEOPLE WITHIN THE MESSAGE TURN
[1:38:25] THEIR BACKS ON GOD AND FACE THEIR ENEMY
[1:38:28] AND HAVE UNION WITH THEM.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; For the Canaanites and the inhabitants
[1:38:37] of the land shall hear of it, and shall
[1:38:40] envir us around, and cut off our name
[1:38:42] our name from the earth, and what will
[1:38:46] thou do unto thy great name? And the
[1:38:49] Lord said unto Joshua, "Get thee up.
[1:38:51] Wherefore liest thou upon thy face. Quit
[1:38:55] crying, Josh.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Israel has sinned."
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; And they have also transgressed my
[1:39:02] covenant which I commanded them. For
[1:39:04] they have even taken of the oursed thing
[1:39:08] and have also stolen and disassembled
[1:39:10] also. And they have put it even among
[1:39:13] their own stuff.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Look at that.
[1:39:16] Come on.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; My home is my castle.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I want you to I want you to
[1:39:22] know that what you preach in church, I
[1:39:26] don't have to do it at home.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz what I do is my problem.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; It's me personally.
[1:39:36] I don't have to adhere to the laws
[1:39:38] you're saying.
[1:39:40] You tell me to do this with my kids and
[1:39:42] this and that. I I don't need to do it.
[1:39:46] Go ahead.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; We're in a time of another battle of AI
[1:39:51] right now.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; We are fighting the battle of artificial
[1:39:55] intelligence.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; AI is not godly intelligence.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; It's not divine intelligence.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; It's not having the mind of Christ. It
[1:40:06] comes from the tree of knowledge. And
[1:40:08] I'm going to tell you that AI is
[1:40:11] infiltrating itself in EVERY FACET OF
[1:40:14] OUR SOCIETY. EVERYTHING around you from
[1:40:16] your home TO YOUR SCHOOL TO YOUR
[1:40:19] GOVERNMENT TO YOUR CHURCHES to the
[1:40:21] ministry.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Everything is affected by AI.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; What is it from? Tree of knowledge.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Call it Siri. Call it Google.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:41] Did you know that they're they're
[1:40:42] telling you your phone is listening to
[1:40:44] you?
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Your iPad?
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Your watch?
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; I got a smartwatch.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I do.
[1:40:59] When it's wet, I know it's raining.
[1:41:06] Oh, you know, I don't mean to make a a
[1:41:08] joke out of this.
[1:41:12] Everything
[1:41:14] in this society,
[1:41:17] Brother Bram said, has come from the
[1:41:19] tree of knowledge.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; And when the tree of knowledge, every
[1:41:23] bite that is taken away from taken off
[1:41:26] of the tree of knowledge brings forth
[1:41:28] death and destruction.
[1:41:30] You think it's just okay
[1:41:33] to let your children
[1:41:36] play with AI
[1:41:39] and to have their iPads and their cell
[1:41:42] phones. I bear you witness
[1:41:46] now. We see it in the world, but I see
[1:41:48] it coming into the church.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; And I see you allowing your children,
[1:41:53] your little ones, to have a cell phone
[1:41:56] and sit there like this.
[1:42:00] And their eyes are going to be real bad
[1:42:02] because you know what? They're they're
[1:42:05] this how far they look.
[1:42:13] Then you wonder why you're going to have
[1:42:14] problems with your kids.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; If China is passing a law that no one
[1:42:21] under 18 can have a cell phone,
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; China
[1:42:31] Yeah,
[1:42:33] I'm just letting this sink in.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that that old man, that
[1:42:38] pastor, he
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I think you just done
[1:42:42] cross the line.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; You're a little too critical.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Why don't you back up, buddy? Why don't
[1:42:50] you Why don't you just ease off a little
[1:42:53] bit?
[1:42:57] I can't.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Thank God. Hallelujah.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; I can't.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not a quitter.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; I never have been.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; And when the going gets tough,
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; that's when the tough get going.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Huh? Let me tell you, this is goal line
[1:43:18] defense.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; This is it. The game's gone into
[1:43:22] overtime.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; They asked some of those guys in the
[1:43:28] Super Bowl. They said, "What is the most
[1:43:30] glorious time of the Super Bowl? Is it
[1:43:32] when you come through the the door into
[1:43:35] the stadium, the crowd's yelling and
[1:43:37] they're blowing their horns and
[1:43:38] everything?" He said, "What is the most
[1:43:41] glorious time for you in with your
[1:43:44] team?" He said, "It's when we're in the
[1:43:46] huddle
[1:43:47] and the game's gone into overtime."
[1:43:50] And he says, "My men, come back to the
[1:43:52] huddle.
[1:43:55] [panting]
[1:43:58] They're breathing hard.
[1:44:00] They've got color on their helmets.
[1:44:05] Their clothes is dirtied.
[1:44:08] Their knuckles are bloodied."
[1:44:14] And the captain of the team says, "Okay,
[1:44:18] guys, here's the play.
[1:44:21] I want every man to do your job."
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Tackles and guards and ends
[1:44:31] and running backs and all of you do YOUR
[1:44:36] JOB. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.
[1:44:40] YOU KNOW, WHEN WE SAY ONTO HEIGHT,
[1:44:44] HE SAID WHEN WE SNAP THE BALL, I WANT
[1:44:46] YOU TO GET INTO YOUR POSITION AND DO
[1:44:51] WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. HE SAID THAT
[1:44:54] RUNNING BACK CANNOT RUN UNLESS YOU MAKE
[1:44:57] THE HOLE.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:11] The byproduct
[1:45:13] of AI is death and destruction
[1:45:16] because they're eating from the tree of
[1:45:19] knowledge. Side effects are all around
[1:45:21] us in every facet OF OUR SOCIETY. DON'T
[1:45:24] YOU KNOW THAT A LITTLE levan leavenvens
[1:45:26] the whole lump?
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Amen. Poison
[1:45:31] been added to the pot.
[1:45:38] Side effects or death and destruction.
[1:45:40] When Elisha discovered somebody had put
[1:45:43] some wild gourds and wild vines
[1:45:46] into the message.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; THEY STARTED GETTING SICK.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; They started HAVING EFFECTS. THERE'S
[1:45:56] DEATH IN THE POT.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:46:02] Elisha knew there was only one remedy.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:46:06] The meal offering.
[1:46:09] 2 Kings 4:38 41. Elisha came unto Gilgal
[1:46:14] and there was dirt in the land which
[1:46:17] means a drought. The sons of the
[1:46:19] prophets were sitting before him. Sons
[1:46:21] of the prophets were started by the sons
[1:46:23] of Samuel.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:46:26] Go read your Bible history.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Most of the time, the sons of the
[1:46:32] prophets never followed the ways of
[1:46:34] their father.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Were sitting before him. And he said
[1:46:42] unto his servant,
[1:46:44] "Set on the great pot and seed pottage
[1:46:48] for the sons of the prophets." And one
[1:46:51] went out into the field to gather herbs,
[1:46:53] and found a wild vine, and gathered
[1:46:56] therefore wild gourds, his lap full, and
[1:46:59] came shred them into the pot of the
[1:47:02] message, for they knew them not.
[1:47:06] They poured out for the men to eat. And
[1:47:08] it came to pass as they were eating of
[1:47:10] the pottage that they cried out and
[1:47:12] said, "Oh, thou man of God, there is
[1:47:14] death in the pot." And they could not
[1:47:16] eat thereof. And he said, "Bring meal."
[1:47:20] And cast it into the pot and said, "Pour
[1:47:22] out for the people that they may eat."
[1:47:26] And there was no harm in the pot.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, preachers have gone out
[1:47:31] and gotten wild vines,
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; wild gourds,
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; wild ideas, strange fire.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Huh? They haven't stayed with the
[1:47:42] original recipe.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Add a little bit of
[1:47:47] a wild vine of Peruia.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Add a little bit of two souls doctrine.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Throw in a pinch of wild seven thunders.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Mix in some deed doctrine and THOROUGHLY
[1:48:04] MIX IT.
[1:48:07] THROW IN ALL KINDS OF isms
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; and the MESSAGE NO LONGER IS PURE AND
[1:48:12] REVIVAL DIES DOWN
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; AND YOU'LL NOT BRING FORTH AN original
[1:48:16] seed.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; I'm [snorts] shaking right now.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; I'm shaking.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Because I take this personally.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:37] No wonder there's a need now among
[1:48:40] message conventions to have prayer lines
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; because the message has been added TO SO
[1:48:47] MUCH BY ALL THESE WILD vines and wild
[1:48:50] gourds that the people are sick.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; THEY GOT ALL KINDS OF COMPLEXES AND AND
[1:48:57] SPIRITS and oh I NEED TO BE FREE AND
[1:48:59] EVERYTHING. BUT YOU DON'T HEAR THE
[1:49:01] PREACHER SAYING REPENT.
[1:49:04] GET BACK TO GOD. [screaming]
[1:49:05] YOU'VE BEEN OUT HERE PLAYING IN THE
[1:49:06] WORLD. YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE MOVIES.
[1:49:08] YOU'VE BEEN MEGA DOSING ON THE WRONG
[1:49:11] THING. GET BACK TO THE WORD.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; No more. No longer repent.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; It's accepted.
[1:49:23] And oh, I tell you, I'll show you. I'm
[1:49:25] I'm a preacher. I tell you what, I got
[1:49:27] deliverance ministry. I'm like the seven
[1:49:30] sons ofKeva
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; out here. I tell you, I'll lay hands on
[1:49:34] you.
[1:49:36] Brother Bram said, "Be careful who you
[1:49:38] lay your hands on."
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "Some sicknesses God allowed."
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "You go to casting that spirit
[1:49:54] off him."
[1:49:57] Huh? Jesus told him, he said, "Go and
[1:49:59] sin no more."
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Lest the what?
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Worse thing.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; That's what's happening.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Cast the spirit off. Oh yes, I'm free.
[1:50:10] I'm free. Two weeks later, they're worse
[1:50:12] than they were before.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they go right back.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; I told you I'm in a pastoral preacher.
[1:50:27] Now, Brother Brennham uses the
[1:50:30] terminology.
[1:50:32] He uses it nine times from 40, excuse
[1:50:35] me, from 1954 to 1964.
[1:50:40] He said, "The sickest body that I know
[1:50:42] of
[1:50:44] is the body of Christ."
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna give you a quote, but he says
[1:50:48] it nine times. Go back and read your
[1:50:50] message.
[1:50:52] He said, "The sickest body." So, I'm
[1:50:54] going to give you one of the quotes, one
[1:50:55] of nine. Sir, we would see Jesus in
[1:50:58] Saskatoon. Any of you ever been to
[1:51:00] Saskatoon?
[1:51:04] He says, "Now, we'll try to let you out
[1:51:06] as early as possible. Pray for the sick
[1:51:08] and ask the sinners to accept Christ."
[1:51:11] That's the object of being here.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; We do not represent any certain church
[1:51:17] or any certain denomination. We're just
[1:51:19] your brethren. We work for all the
[1:51:21] churches of the living God. And I
[1:51:23] believe that there is a need of healing
[1:51:26] tonight more than physical healing.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; I believe it's a spiritual healing.
[1:51:37] For the sickest body I know of, the body
[1:51:39] of Jesus Christ is the sickest body I
[1:51:42] know of. That's a big statement.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Watch. He shows you the symptoms.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; It's so broke up. So many different
[1:51:56] denominations and factions.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; And so we're trying to do our best by
[1:52:01] the gospel to heal that broken body that
[1:52:05] all the people might come together with
[1:52:06] one great unity. I don't mean you have
[1:52:09] to leave your church or uh or make a one
[1:52:12] organization. Stay in your
[1:52:14] organizations. That doesn't hurt
[1:52:16] anything. But be brothers while you're
[1:52:18] in your organization.
[1:52:20] I was a Baptist as you know of and I'm
[1:52:22] still a Baptist. I'm a Pentecostal
[1:52:24] Baptist now since I received the Holy
[1:52:26] Spirit.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenam said, "I'm a Baptist as
[1:52:30] long as you stay with the word. I'm a
[1:52:32] Pentecostal as long He says I'm a bent
[1:52:35] Pentecostal Baptist Lutheran Methodist."
[1:52:37] You ever seen him?
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; YouTube is full of all kinds of
[1:52:45] preachers adding their own wild ideas to
[1:52:47] the message. And when you click on one,
[1:52:50] you'll get another. And you click on
[1:52:52] that one, you'll get another. In fact,
[1:52:53] it's never ending.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; And they're all trying to procelite you.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, a minister that
[1:53:00] procelites from other pastors
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; is a dying preacher.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Huh? When a minister puts down other
[1:53:09] ministers
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; to lift his own ministry up is a dying
[1:53:14] or a drowning preacher.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Right? You ever tried to help somebody
[1:53:19] when they're drowning?
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I have.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; I've had the opportunity. I've saved
[1:53:24] seven people from drowning in my
[1:53:25] lifetime.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; And when you see a panicked person and
[1:53:31] they're drowning,
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; and their eyes are wild. If they get a
[1:53:35] hold of you,
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you take water safety
[1:53:41] instruction and you learn how to save
[1:53:43] somebody, but I'll tell you what, I'm
[1:53:44] not going to make myself look like a
[1:53:46] hero, like I went out there and I swam
[1:53:48] up there to him and I went underneath
[1:53:50] him, caught him from behind and I took
[1:53:52] him and No, no. You know what I did? I
[1:53:54] had a surfboard paddle out there with my
[1:53:56] surfboard and I pushed the surfboard to
[1:53:58] him. I didn't get near him.
[1:54:01] Put the surfboard.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Jim, I let them climb up on top
[1:54:05] of the surfboard. [laughter]
[1:54:08] You okay? Yeah. You okay? I'm going to
[1:54:10] take you in.
[1:54:14] I paddled them in. You know what's the
[1:54:16] amazing thing? Out of all the people
[1:54:18] that I've ever saved from drowning, not
[1:54:21] one said thank you.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:54:25] [laughter] The family come over to
[1:54:28] They had their beach towels and they
[1:54:30] gathered everything [laughter]
[1:54:33] and they walked off crying.
[1:54:36] Yeah, it's okay.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; You're welcome.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; They were [snorts] in such shock.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said in harvest time,
[1:54:51] he says like the wild gourds, death in
[1:54:53] the pottage from the school of their
[1:54:56] theologians, they don't want Jesus the
[1:54:59] bread of life. They don't want him. They
[1:55:01] put him out of their church. They've got
[1:55:04] to do it. I don't care what they do. You
[1:55:06] say, "You think you're going to change
[1:55:07] it, Brother Brennan?" No, sir.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; But I'm speaking to the elected.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; I can't change them, but I'm going to
[1:55:18] talk to the elect.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I SAY JUST ENOUGH OUT THERE IN
[1:55:25] DENOMINATION." HE SAYS, "I CAN'T EVEN
[1:55:28] use the WORD PREDESTINATION." RIGHT?
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; I HAVE TO USE FORNOWLEDGE.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:34] He said, "BUT I SAY JUST ENOUGH OF THE
[1:55:36] WORD THAT IF THEY'RE ELECTED, THEY CATCH
[1:55:39] IT."
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO
[1:55:41] YOU.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "JUST ENOUGH."
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT HOW MANY TAPES YOU HEAR. IT'S
[1:55:47] WHAT YOU HEAR FROM THE TAPE YOU DID.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RAM SAID, "LITTLE OLD WASHER
[1:55:54] WOMAN WITH ONE TAPE
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; CAN MAKE IT." WHY? CUZ SHE SAYS AMEN TO
[1:56:00] WHAT SHE HEARD. IT'S NOT HOW MANY TAPES.
[1:56:03] It's not having a library.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; It's taking that tape.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; And eating.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Take this word.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Eat it.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; What good is all of these books if you
[1:56:26] don't read them?
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; my young people.
[1:56:30] I'm going to make a challenge to all of
[1:56:32] you,
[1:56:34] to my young people.
[1:56:39] If you don't have a seven seals book and
[1:56:41] a seven church age book, which are two
[1:56:43] foundational books,
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; yes, sir,
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; I will get them for you and I will gift
[1:56:50] them to you.
[1:56:52] And I want you to put your name in it,
[1:56:56] but I don't want you to put it on the
[1:56:57] shelf
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; to just say, "I got a seven churches
[1:57:00] book.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; I got the seven seals."
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to do like a lot of
[1:57:05] people who around the world, they get
[1:57:07] these books and they stand there and
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; I'm happy. I got a book. I got a Bible.
[1:57:14] I got, you know, whatever. And it's But
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; do you read it?
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Better for you to have one book and read
[1:57:21] it. than it is to have a whole a whole
[1:57:24] library. But I'll say this to all of
[1:57:25] you. If you don't have it, you let me
[1:57:28] know. Brother Ron, I need a seven church
[1:57:30] age book and a seven seals. And I'll
[1:57:32] I'll go go so far as to say this. If you
[1:57:34] don't have a Bible, I'll buy you one. I
[1:57:36] won't get you some cheap little uh uh
[1:57:38] Bible you get over here at Kmart. I'll
[1:57:40] get you one that's got a leather binding
[1:57:42] to it.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; I'll get you a quality Bible.
[1:57:48] So that's a challenge to all of you
[1:57:50] guys,
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; even to our littleer ones.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; That's your sword.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; It is your sword.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; And every sword, Brother Steve, needs a
[1:58:00] sheath.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; You see, you see this sword you got?
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Stand up. Turn around and show everybody
[1:58:09] your sheath.
[1:58:12] Amen. Bless the Lord.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Because you don't want to take your
[1:58:16] Bible. Go ahead and sit down
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; and just throw it on the dashboard of
[1:58:21] your car in the heat of this Arizona
[1:58:23] sun. Shrivel up the pages.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Leave it out IN THE RAIN. THROW IT IN
[1:58:28] THE BACK OF YOUR CAR WITH ALL OF YOUR
[1:58:30] JUNK.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; With your pickle ball racket
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; and your golf clubs.
[1:58:41] Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; And the pages get all wrinkled and
[1:58:46] shriveled up.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Keep it in shape.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; The way you treat your Bible
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; is the way you treat God.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Reverence it.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Get a cover for it.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Don't just leave it anywhere. Just don't
[1:59:06] throw it off to the side. Never take it.
[1:59:15] Throw it across the room.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; You reference it.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; You pray over it before you read it.
[1:59:26] [sighs]
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; I told you it's a pastoral.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Random, you think you're going
[1:59:35] to change it? Let's go back to this
[1:59:36] quote. No, sir.
[1:59:39] But I'm speaking to the elected.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Watch this. They put him out. They took
[1:59:44] their pottage,
[1:59:46] mixed it with the world, some theories
[1:59:48] of something and mixed it together and
[1:59:50] made it a theological seminary pottage.
[1:59:54] And they refused the prophet Elijah's
[1:59:56] meal to cure it.
[2:00:00] Did they do it again that in that day?
[2:00:03] Elijah had some meal. That meal was
[2:00:06] Christ.
[2:00:08] the meal offering all ground the same.
[2:00:11] Every burr had to be the same to grind
[2:00:13] it and throw it back in there and cured
[2:00:15] the sickness, their death in the pot.
[2:00:17] But today they got death in the pot and
[2:00:19] they don't want Elijah's meal,
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Christ, the bread, the word. No sir,
[2:00:25] it's heresy.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; DID NOT PAUL SAID, "I SERVE GOD IN THE
[2:00:31] WAY THAT MEN TODAY CALL HERESY."
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:00:37] They won't have it. Go ahead and eat it
[2:00:40] and you'll die sure as the world.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; There's poison in the pot. They won't
[2:00:45] accept this meal. No sir. In their
[2:00:48] theological pots, they just won't do it.
[2:00:51] Now, they put you out of it. They don't
[2:00:53] want nothing to do with it. That's a
[2:00:56] whole sermon within itself. I've often
[2:00:59] wanted to preach the theological pots
[2:01:02] within the message.
[2:01:06] AI has affected
[2:01:09] our homes, our ministries,
[2:01:13] our churches, our schools, our
[2:01:15] government, and our nation.
[2:01:18] Great and powerful nations. Great and
[2:01:21] powerful nations. Any of you that know
[2:01:24] your history, great empires,
[2:01:29] China,
[2:01:31] Egypt,
[2:01:33] Greece,
[2:01:35] Rome,
[2:01:38] and now the United States.
[2:01:41] Great
[2:01:43] powerful nations.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Now watch this. Let me
[2:01:52] Let me take a few more minutes
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; because I take this message
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; so personal.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; I think some of you haven't really
[2:02:10] looked at it the way it should be looked
[2:02:12] at. You can't see the forest for the
[2:02:15] trees. Yeah.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; In June of 2020, I preached
[2:02:22] a sermon called morphing of America.
[2:02:26] Changing from lamb to dragon.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; You remember that?
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; The morphing of America.
[2:02:35] And I use the terminology the turning
[2:02:37] point of America
[2:02:39] is going back to the mother church
[2:02:44] just into a form of godliness but
[2:02:46] denying the power there thereof. And
[2:02:48] then I preached the next week that the
[2:02:51] end time prophecies are matching the end
[2:02:53] time message.
[2:03:00] This has so deeply affected me. I don't
[2:03:03] want my sermons to just be flowery and
[2:03:06] nice and we're all going to heaven and
[2:03:09] aren't you glad you're part of this
[2:03:11] elect and no. I want I want you to know
[2:03:15] we're in battle.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Y
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; and sometimes I get a little weary
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; sometimes when a fighter is in there and
[2:03:28] he gets hit.
[2:03:30] Who was it? Mike Tyson said, "Oh yeah, I
[2:03:32] have a game plan for every fight until I
[2:03:36] get my bell rung."
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; And then he said, "Then it becomes
[2:03:42] instinct. I back up onto the ropes. Back
[2:03:45] up. Cover up. Cover up. Get my
[2:03:49] [sighs and panting]
[2:03:51] get my stamina back."
[2:03:54] And then all of a sudden
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; The word fire appears in the Bible over
[2:04:09] 549 times.
[2:04:13] And there is no other symbol or natural
[2:04:16] effect nor type within the Bible that
[2:04:19] types God more than fire.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Fire.
[2:04:25] God likens
[2:04:27] his spirit baptism to a baptism of fire.
[2:04:32] The most clean cleansing agent I can
[2:04:34] think of is fire.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; John said, "I baptize you unto
[2:04:40] repentance." That's good. Just water.
[2:04:44] But there's one coming after me
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; whose baptism is far greater.
[2:04:51] For he shall baptize you with the Holy
[2:04:54] Ghost and fire.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; God give us ministries who are flames of
[2:04:58] fire. I don't want our young ministries
[2:05:02] here that these younger ministries that
[2:05:04] just preach nice little sermons, you
[2:05:07] know, and and flowery and everything
[2:05:09] like that. And you go into your AI
[2:05:13] computer
[2:05:15] and you go there and you search through
[2:05:17] the message some sermon topic and you
[2:05:22] take the topic, you find what brother
[2:05:24] Ram said. I give just give you an
[2:05:26] example, the love of God. And maybe you
[2:05:28] type in you put the the the you know the
[2:05:31] little whatever quotation marks around
[2:05:33] it. So type in love of God and oh guess
[2:05:36] what there's 560 quotes on the love of
[2:05:38] God. So I'll take this one and this one
[2:05:40] and this one. Cut and paste. And in
[2:05:42] order to really have an emphasis OF THE
[2:05:45] QUOTE I'LL READ THE QUOTE. BROTHER
[2:05:47] BRANDHAM SAID HALLELUJAH. DO YOU BELIEVE
[2:05:50] WHAT HE SAID? HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.
[2:05:52] HALLELUJAH. AND THINKING THAT VOLUME IS
[2:05:55] ANOINTING.
[2:05:56] AMEN.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; If you want to get somebody's attention
[2:06:00] here,
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; you ever been in a crowd of people and
[2:06:06] you say, "Hey, hey, I I got something to
[2:06:09] tell you." Everybody,
[2:06:12] hey, hey, keep talking.
[2:06:15] Ain't none of your business.
[2:06:24] God likens his spirit baptism to that of
[2:06:27] fire.
[2:06:29] And I told you
[2:06:32] that wherever you find the pillar of
[2:06:34] fire, you'll find God's voice.
[2:06:38] You brethren in the back there that are
[2:06:39] on the computer,
[2:06:41] I want you to find a picture of Brother
[2:06:43] Brendan with the pillar of fire above
[2:06:45] his head,
[2:06:47] I want you to just use AI right now.
[2:06:54] And I want to see a picture that was
[2:06:57] taken
[2:07:00] of the pillar of fire because wherever
[2:07:02] you find
[2:07:04] the pillar of fire, look for his voice.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; That's good
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; because over 33 times in your Bible,
[2:07:14] whenever you see the pillar of fire,
[2:07:16] it's associated with God's voice.
[2:07:21] When you're ready, let me know.
[2:07:25] Fire represents his voice.
[2:07:28] God speaks from the midst of fire. I
[2:07:30] read that to you from Deuteronomy.
[2:07:33] How? Oh, there it is.
[2:07:40] Brother Brennham said that picture alone
[2:07:45] will condemn the world. He said, "Even
[2:07:48] that woman that looked at it one time
[2:07:50] and she snickered,
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; she blasphemed God."
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "For you to have that picture
[2:07:59] taken
[2:08:01] and for you TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT WITH
[2:08:03] YOUR PHYSICAL EYE is actually more
[2:08:05] evidence than if you saw it
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; physically."
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; So all of you get ready.
[2:08:18] He allowed you to see this picture
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; because you know what God is doing. And
[2:08:22] listen to me. Listen to me carefully.
[2:08:25] This was for a purpose.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; God was vindicating.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; This is my messenger.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[2:08:39] Because out of the midst of fire,
[2:08:44] wherever you find the pillar of fire,
[2:08:46] you'll find God's voice.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; When Moses saw that pillar of fire and
[2:08:53] he stopped and he it was an attraction
[2:08:55] on the mountain
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; and he CAME INTO THE PRESENCE OF FIRE.
[2:09:01] YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? IT CHANGED HIM.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; May I say this to all of you? HOW CAN
[2:09:08] YOU COME INTO THE PRESENCE OF THIS
[2:09:11] PILLAR OF FIRE AND THIS VINDICATED
[2:09:14] MESSAGE AND IT NOT change you?
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Because if it doesn't, you're not seed.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Yep. Amen.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you straight out.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Because if it's BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID,
[2:09:23] WATCH. HE said when the elected come
[2:09:26] under that anointing, it'll quicken
[2:09:28] them. BUT HE SAID NONSEED.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Got to look at [laughter]
[2:09:37] Ain't nothing to it.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; Remember May the 7th, 1946 that an angel
[2:09:46] appears and said, "Now's the time." And
[2:09:49] Israel became a nation. And here,
[2:09:51] Matthew 24, behold, when you see the fig
[2:09:54] tree put forth her buds,
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; the time is nigh. Is that right? Amen.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; So here the very same time, very same
[2:10:03] hour, Israel became a nation is when
[2:10:05] this prophet is commissioned
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; to go out.
[2:10:13] Then January
[2:10:16] the 24th,
[2:10:18] 1950,
[2:10:20] they took that picture.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; Y
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; 1950.
[2:10:26] He's preaching a convention in Houston,
[2:10:29] Texas.
[2:10:31] [clears throat]
[2:10:32] And the man that was hired was a
[2:10:35] professional photographer. And he's he
[2:10:37] was hired by critics
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; to try to disprove brother Ram. And so
[2:10:42] now this professional photographer
[2:10:44] professional
[2:10:49] taking all. And guess what? Of all the
[2:10:51] pictures he took, there was only one
[2:10:53] that was developed.
[2:10:56] So they took that and they sent it away
[2:10:58] to the curator of
[2:11:01] facts
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; want to know. They came back and
[2:11:05] certified.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; He said the light struck the lens.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a figment.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; It wasn't added.
[2:11:22] It wasn't where you can photoshop
[2:11:24] something. This was not photoshopped.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; And you take it lightly
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; about this message.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; And you play around with it.
[2:11:39] You
[2:11:41] maybe you don't take it serious enough.
[2:11:50] I'm as serious about this message as I
[2:11:52] am a heart attack.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Because when I came into this
[2:12:02] understanding of the message,
[2:12:06] I was caught on fire.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Spontaneous.
[2:12:16] 18year-old kid
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; not knowing nothing.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; It caught fire.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; I've tried to lay down and roll and put
[2:12:31] it out and I can't.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, it's consuming.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; And I love it more today.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Than I did when I came in.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:45] I'm not looking to get out of the
[2:12:46] message.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; I'm looking to get more into it.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Because the message is Christ.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Then January 1961,
[2:13:00] pillar of fire draws on the wall of the
[2:13:02] tabernacle. The people saw it.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Through the seven church ages.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Rem talks about a throne of
[2:13:11] mercy and judgment.
[2:13:13] Cons confirming the seven church ages
[2:13:17] are the seven lamps burning with fire.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; In December of 1962, he's got a vision
[2:13:25] of seven mighty angels.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; He says they came from eternity.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Wings swept back.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Mighty powerful angels.
[2:13:37] He says they came in in a moment like
[2:13:39] the twinkling of an eye.
[2:13:42] He says there I was in the presence and
[2:13:45] I WAS CAUGHT UP.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; YES.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; INTO THE MIDST OF SEVEN MIGHTY ANGELS.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; LATER HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT EACH
[2:13:56] ONE OF THOSE ANGELS HAD A SEAL.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; AND THE FIRST ANGEL CAME TO HIM WITH THE
[2:14:02] OPENING OF THE FIRST SEAL AND SHOWED HIM
[2:14:05] THAT IT'S NOT CHRIST RIDING DOWN THROUGH
[2:14:07] THE AGES.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE ANTICHRIST.
[2:14:12] THE WHITE horse rider is the antichrist.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; In January 1963, he's up in Sabino
[2:14:21] Canyon as he's praying about this
[2:14:25] vision because there's a
[2:14:28] there's a loud noise.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; He says, "Is it mean my death?"
[2:14:37] Probably nobody can live through
[2:14:39] something such a blast.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Are you Listen,
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; I don't want you just These are things
[2:14:47] that I want to rehearse in your I want
[2:14:50] to put you back into your memory
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; though you already know these things.
[2:14:57] He's in 1963
[2:15:00] up in Sabino Canyon. What does this
[2:15:02] vision mean?
[2:15:04] And there a sword appears into his hand.
[2:15:06] And I'm referred to Isaiah 66 15 and 16.
[2:15:10] Behold, the Lord will come with fire,
[2:15:14] and with his chariots a whirlwind to
[2:15:16] render his anger with fury, and his
[2:15:19] rebuke with flames of fire. And for by
[2:15:22] fire and by his sword will the Lord
[2:15:25] plead with all flesh.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; By fire
[2:15:30] and by sword.
[2:15:37] on February of 1963 in Sunset Mountain.
[2:15:42] It shall be light
[2:15:45] about the evening time.
[2:15:48] The path to glory you shall surely find.
[2:16:00] He's up there pillar of fire.
[2:16:04] He says it comes down.
[2:16:06] He says, "My I begin to tell the
[2:16:08] brethren, NO, RUN, HIDE, GET UNDER
[2:16:10] SOMETHING,
[2:16:12] for judgment's ready to strike."
[2:16:17] He said, "The mountains shook, the
[2:16:20] branches were cut off the trees, and he
[2:16:22] said, rocks were blasted into little
[2:16:24] three cornered pieces."
[2:16:28] He he said, "There I stood." And they
[2:16:31] watched Brother Brandham as he stood
[2:16:33] there and took his hat off.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; Do you realize he was transported up
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; into another sphere?
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; He was now being transported. This was
[2:16:49] not alien abduction.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; This was divine.
[2:16:55] AND
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; HE'S CAUGHT up into the midst of seven
[2:16:57] mighty angels.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; He said there, I looked down, I could
[2:17:01] see the whole area of Sunset Mountain.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; He said, "Go back to
[2:17:08] Jeffersonville, for thus saith the
[2:17:10] Lord."
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "You'll be given the revelation
[2:17:15] of the six seals."
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; Did I say that wrong?
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:17:22] Why is it then that some people can tell
[2:17:24] you there's only six revealed in seven?
[2:17:26] That's why we need a return ministry.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; You got some kind of wild gourd you're
[2:17:31] throwing into the pot.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; Anyway,
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; so March 17th through the 24th, 1963, he
[2:17:44] starts opening the seven seals. The
[2:17:47] revival fire has now been lit.
[2:17:52] Hallelujah.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; The dross of the former teaching of this
[2:17:56] message now taken away. All of Clarence
[2:17:59] Larkin's dispensational truths and all
[2:18:01] of the pre- niasian fathers and all of
[2:18:04] the theological teaching and now burnt
[2:18:07] out of the mind of that prophet until he
[2:18:10] had nothing but the mind of Christ.
[2:18:22] Now, let me bring this to a close
[2:18:25] with just telling you about another
[2:18:29] baptism of fire.
[2:18:34] Just as the natural man has got to go
[2:18:37] through water, blood, spirit,
[2:18:39] fire, water, blood, fire, right? Are we
[2:18:42] together on that?
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "So does the earth."
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's got to receive its
[2:18:49] baptism of fire."
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; And he said, "The next
[2:18:55] plan for the earth is a battle called
[2:18:58] the battle of Armageddon."
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Revelations 17 verse 12-1 17. And the 10
[2:19:07] horns with thou saws are 10 kings which
[2:19:10] have received no kingdom as yet, but
[2:19:12] receive power as kings one hour with the
[2:19:14] beasts. And these having one mind, and
[2:19:16] shall give their power and strength unto
[2:19:18] the beast, and these shall make war with
[2:19:20] the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome
[2:19:22] them, for he is the Lord of lords and
[2:19:24] King of kings. And they that are with
[2:19:27] him are called the chosen and faithful.
[2:19:29] Amen.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; And he saith unto me, the waters which
[2:19:32] thou sawest, where the siteth, are
[2:19:35] peoples, and multitudes, and nations,
[2:19:37] and tongues, and the tens horns which
[2:19:39] thou saw upon the beast. These shall
[2:19:42] hate the
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; and shall make her desolate and naked,
[2:19:46] and shall eat her flesh, and burn her
[2:19:50] with fire.
[2:19:53] For God hath put in their hearts to
[2:19:55] fulfill his will and to agree and give
[2:19:57] their kingdom under the beast until the
[2:19:59] words of God shall be fulfilled. Russia
[2:20:01] is now being raised up to destroy
[2:20:03] Romanism and the Vatican. Sure.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; In second Peter
[2:20:12] 3:es 9-12, the Lord is not slack
[2:20:15] concerning his promise, as some men
[2:20:17] count slackness,
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; but is long-suffering to usward, and not
[2:20:22] willing that any should perish, but all
[2:20:23] should come to repentance. But the day
[2:20:26] of the Lord will come as a thief in the
[2:20:28] night,
[2:20:29] in which the heavens shall pass away
[2:20:32] with a great noise, and with the
[2:20:34] elements that shall melt with fervent
[2:20:36] heat. The earth also, and the works
[2:20:38] therein there shall be burned up, seeing
[2:20:41] then all these things shall be
[2:20:43] dissolved. What manner of person ought
[2:20:44] we to be, and all holy conversation and
[2:20:47] godliness,
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; looking for and hastening under the
[2:20:50] coming of the day of God.
[2:20:53] wherein the heavens being on fire which
[2:20:56] shall be dissolved and the elements
[2:20:58] shall melt with a fervent heat. Brother
[2:21:01] Bram said
[2:21:03] before one bomb drops here in America.
[2:21:08] He said the bride will be in glory.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Now I'm closing
[2:21:15] musicians if you come. I was with
[2:21:18] brother Joseph Brandham.
[2:21:20] We were
[2:21:23] We were in Louisville.
[2:21:27] We were just driving around and Brother
[2:21:28] Joseph pulled his car up to a certain
[2:21:31] intersection. I'm sorry. I don't I
[2:21:33] didn't memorize. He said, "Brother Ron,
[2:21:35] do you know anything about this
[2:21:36] intersection here?" He didn't say 8th
[2:21:39] and Penn Street. I know that's
[2:21:41] tabernacle.
[2:21:44] He said, "You know anything about this
[2:21:45] intersection?" He said, "No, sir, I
[2:21:47] don't." He said, "This is where the
[2:21:49] first bomb that hits America is going to
[2:21:52] strike right here at this intersection
[2:21:54] in Louisville, Kentucky." He said, "It's
[2:21:57] the most evil, corrupt city in America."
[2:22:00] Go read it.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; It talks about Louisville
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; and it's just across the river, just
[2:22:06] across the bridge.
[2:22:14] So now, brother Brennham says in the
[2:22:16] sermon victory day,
[2:22:18] we've had many great battles, spiritual
[2:22:20] battles, many great V days that your
[2:22:23] church has had. I mean, the church, the
[2:22:25] body of Christ. I'm not talking about
[2:22:26] the organization system. Now, I'm
[2:22:28] talking about the body of Christ, the
[2:22:31] body of believers down through the ages
[2:22:34] have had many great V-Days.
[2:22:38] We talk about we have had several wars.
[2:22:41] The wars and rumors of wars and V days
[2:22:43] and V days and V days.
[2:22:46] It'll finally wind up into the great
[2:22:48] battle of Armageddon.
[2:22:51] That'll be the last of it.
[2:22:55] When she comes to the battle of
[2:22:56] Armageddon, that'll set the whole thing.
[2:22:59] That'll settle the whole thing. Just
[2:23:00] before the great millennium, Armageddon
[2:23:03] is to clean off the earth. She purifies
[2:23:06] herself with atomic bomb blow atomic
[2:23:09] blowing and volcanic ash and things sink
[2:23:14] sinks this soaked blood of men upon the
[2:23:17] earth and sin and crime. She sinks
[2:23:19] beneath the earth and a volcanic braze
[2:23:22] out again and renews and cleanses the
[2:23:24] earth for the great millennium. He
[2:23:26] cleanses his church during that time for
[2:23:28] a people to live here. God is allowing
[2:23:32] Russia, listen to me. He said, "Watch
[2:23:34] Russia, king of the north."
[2:23:38] He said, "Amageddon
[2:23:41] is a cleansing,
[2:23:44] but he said there's coming another
[2:23:45] greater cleansing."
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; One is a man cleansing, then there's a
[2:23:49] cleansing of God.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; There will be a new heaven and a new
[2:23:59] earth.
[2:24:02] The new Jerusalem will establish itself
[2:24:04] upon the earth. Brother Ram said in
[2:24:07] future home of the heavenly bridegroom,
[2:24:10] a holy fire from God which cleanses the
[2:24:12] earth and the heavens around it. Then
[2:24:15] it's purchased so that the redeemed can
[2:24:16] live on it live in peace. Notice the
[2:24:19] baptism of fire is to cleanse it from
[2:24:21] sin, from sickness, from disease, germs,
[2:24:24] from sinners, from the death, from the
[2:24:26] devil, and all of his groups. He is to
[2:24:29] be cast out into the lake of fire. Holy
[2:24:31] fire from God comes down from God out of
[2:24:34] heaven and turn and and burns it up.
[2:24:37] Notice and make it ready for God to
[2:24:39] dwell in for God in the new world that
[2:24:42] is to come is to dwell in the earth.
[2:24:48] The same plan of redemption to use
[2:24:52] both the world and the persons that live
[2:24:54] in it.
[2:24:57] The last quote there on future home. And
[2:24:59] when the earth is restored by the same
[2:25:01] thing, there are no more no more
[2:25:04] cursing, no more storms, [music]
[2:25:06] no more winds, no more typhoons.
[2:25:12] They are reconciled. Man and God has
[2:25:15] met. The new earth will be put on its
[2:25:18] Eden beauty again. The new earth will
[2:25:21] spread forth her after her baptism of
[2:25:23] fire.
[2:25:25] Oh, she'll catch a fire and burn up. The
[2:25:28] elements will burn with fervent heat.
[2:25:30] All the works in the earth will burn.
[2:25:33] The water will explode. Did you know in
[2:25:37] the first time that I read it in the
[2:25:39] book of Revelation because I'm a surfer.
[2:25:42] Once a surfer, always a surfer. I just
[2:25:45] retired from it, but I still think it's
[2:25:47] the greatest
[2:25:49] sport.
[2:25:50] And the Bible says in new heavens and
[2:25:52] new earth. And there was no more sea.
[2:25:58] And Ron wept.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; Me too.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; I said,
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; "No more sea.
[2:26:06] What about surfing?"
[2:26:09] I thought about the perfect wave and how
[2:26:11] I'm going to get up there and I'm just
[2:26:13] going to surf and all you guys can go do
[2:26:15] what you want to do. I'm just going to
[2:26:17] go surfing
[2:26:19] and there's no more sea.
[2:26:21] So the next thing you know, I had a
[2:26:22] little dream
[2:26:24] and all of a sudden the clouds
[2:26:27] started to shape take a shape of a swell
[2:26:31] and I paddled into it.
[2:26:36] Ah, it's just a dream.
[2:26:40] Brother Bram said, "If I could make you
[2:26:43] understand that the life down here is
[2:26:45] like a pig."
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; And the best part of this earth
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:26:50] is no more than a
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; a vile pig's life.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "Would you want to go back to
[2:26:56] that?"
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, this message,
[2:27:06] let's not let the revival fire of this
[2:27:09] message die.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; As a pastor, I say, "Let's refuel it."
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the direction I'm heading
[2:27:21] for next Sunday
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; is how to refuel your fire
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; because listen, this little bride is not
[2:27:28] going to go with just some kind of
[2:27:30] little
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; little fizzle.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:27:36] I've told you before, you ever had
[2:27:37] firecrackers? You light them and all of
[2:27:39] a sudden, you know, there there's ones
[2:27:41] that boom.
[2:27:43] We as kids, man, we like the louder, the
[2:27:46] better, the bigger pow M80s, barrel
[2:27:49] bombs, all of these cherry bombs,
[2:27:51] everything. We just man get them. She
[2:27:54] We're blowing everything up.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; Then we had the firecrackers, you know,
[2:28:00] black cat and all this stuff. And we
[2:28:02] light it in that little hot [music] gym.
[2:28:04] It goes,
[2:28:07] we light it and everybody's standing
[2:28:09] there waiting for it and then it goes,
[2:28:11] "What a joke.
[2:28:14] I don't want no littlemen."
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; So, you know what we found you could do
[2:28:19] now? Oh, I bet. Now, I'm not going to
[2:28:21] tell you. [laughter]
[2:28:24] You kids will do it,
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; but I don't want you to do it.
[2:28:30] But this little bride is not going to go
[2:28:31] out.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "You watch that third pull
[2:28:34] then?"
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "What you've seen temporarily."
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "It'll be manifest in the
[2:28:41] fullness of its power." You ain't seen
[2:28:43] nothing yet. Now, it ain't something you
[2:28:45] got to manufacture. You don't have to
[2:28:47] say, "Hey, I'll get out here and it's
[2:28:49] going to be some minister and he's going
[2:28:50] to have some great revelation and all of
[2:28:52] you going to have to come to him and
[2:28:54] you're going to have to get it because
[2:28:55] if you ain't uh under his ministry,
[2:28:57] you're not in THE BRIDE." AH, STOP IT.
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; There's one belt messenger given TO THE
[2:29:05] SAGE WHO is his vindication is to take
[2:29:09] your heart AND TAKE IT BACK TO THE FAITH
[2:29:12] OF YOUR FATHERS.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. It's not the ministry of a
[2:29:16] man.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; It's the ministry of the son of man.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him this morning.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; I do.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; I love him with all my heart.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; Like I said, I don't want to break down.
[2:29:33] I don't want to burn out. I want to
[2:29:34] break out.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; I want to be consumed.
[2:29:44] I do.
[2:29:52] I take it personal.
[2:29:56] When some of you struggle,
[2:29:59] you don't come to church.
[2:30:03] You don't get into it like you should.
[2:30:06] Come on.
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; Some of you it's just become a form.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; Some of you I won't see until the next
[2:30:13] feast,
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; then they show up.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing? Everybody shows up for
[2:30:18] a feast and they don't show up for the
[2:30:21] word.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Brother Ron, we need to
[2:30:24] build a balcony. We'll start the balcony
[2:30:26] over here. We'll we'll go over here into
[2:30:28] this corner and that balcony will wrap
[2:30:30] around and go over here like that." And
[2:30:31] I said, "Not until we got as many
[2:30:34] Wednesday night as what we have Sunday
[2:30:36] morning."
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; I ain't going to build no balcony. Half
[2:30:41] of you will want to go sit up there and
[2:30:43] sit as far away from me as you can.
[2:30:44] Anyway,
[2:30:48] [laughter]
[2:30:50] I got problem with balcony sitters.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; Front row.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:04] I I listen. I'm going to bless all you
[2:31:07] guys on the front row right now. Bless
[2:31:09] you.
[2:31:11] Bless you immensely.
[2:31:14] Front row sitters. You ain't afraid.
[2:31:18] You getting close.
[2:31:20] Be careful
[2:31:22] because when I get on fire,
[2:31:25] hey, licks of fire start sparking off of
[2:31:28] me onto you. Yeah.
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden,
[2:31:32] you man.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I tell you what, some of you need
[2:31:36] a little spark.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; Well, some of this when it's the real
[2:31:43] Holy Ghost, the more you blow on it,
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; the greater the fire burns.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:31:57] I've delivered my heart this morning.
[2:32:04] I want all of you to look around you and
[2:32:07] see those that you see. See, look at
[2:32:09] your own life.
[2:32:12] You don't have to look at others. Look
[2:32:13] at yourself.
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; I see
[2:32:18] maybe church becoming a ritual,
[2:32:21] becoming formal.
[2:32:26] the fire of revival dies down. And
[2:32:29] brother Bram said, "I'm afraid what this
[2:32:32] last end time will be is a few anointed
[2:32:34] preachers."
[2:32:36] And he said, "And some in the
[2:32:38] congregation sitting there trying to
[2:32:40] absorb what they're preaching."
[2:32:44] Oh, my desire is that each one of you
[2:32:49] meet the same pillar of fire
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; that Paul met on the road to Damascus.
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; That you meet the same pillar of fire
[2:32:57] the prophet of God met.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; The same pillar of fire that I met.
[2:33:01] Because you know what? My life's
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. my scholarship to San Diego State
[2:33:08] University
[2:33:10] for marine biology specializing in the
[2:33:13] field of underwater archaeology.
[2:33:18] I only went my first year of college and
[2:33:21] guess what? I loved it. I wasn't You
[2:33:25] know what? I couldn't wait to get out of
[2:33:27] high school because high school is
[2:33:28] babysitting.
[2:33:30] Uh we're going to take roll call. Uh
[2:33:33] Ron, are you here? Say here. Uh, Flo,
[2:33:36] are you here? Say here. Uh, you know,
[2:33:38] Johnny, are you here? Here. Yeah. Yeah.
[2:33:41] Stop it. In college, they said, I don't
[2:33:43] care if you come to class or not.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; And he says, in fact,
[2:33:51] the toughest class ever had, the
[2:33:53] prophet, the the professor, you know
[2:33:55] what he said? It's open book test. Bring
[2:33:58] all your notes. Bring your book. And he
[2:34:00] says, because most of you are going to
[2:34:02] fail.
[2:34:04] So he said, [music] "So I'm here. I'm
[2:34:06] not going to babysit you. I don't care
[2:34:07] if you even show up for class."
[2:34:10] And he said, "And so an open book test,
[2:34:14] how many know that's the hardest
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; because you know, oh yeah, I got that in
[2:34:18] my notes." Oh, yeah. Hang on, hang on.
[2:34:20] Yeah, I I know. I know. I put it in red
[2:34:23] somewhere. Yeah. uh
[2:34:26] you waste all the time because if you
[2:34:28] don't know the answers,
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; you're sitting there researching and
[2:34:32] finding turn in your
[2:34:36] ain't even done.
[2:34:39] Did you know this is an open book test?
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; This ain't a time to
[2:34:47] go and huh it's open book.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; How many of you have gotten into the
[2:34:53] open book? How many of you have gotten
[2:34:54] into the revealed word of the hour?
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; And pardon me, brother null, to use you
[2:35:02] as another example, but take an 81y old
[2:35:04] man. I'm 72. I'll be 73 in December.
[2:35:11] I'm done with this overseas stuff.
[2:35:17] It's hard,
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; Sister Shirley. Is it tough?
[2:35:22] Huh?
[2:35:24] Yeah. It ain't easy.
[2:35:28] So, which one of you will go for me?
[2:35:31] Which one of you will carry the lamp
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; and the fire of God, not let it go out?
[2:35:36] Which one of you will be the preacher of
[2:35:38] tomorrow?
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; Because there I ain't always going to be
[2:35:46] your pastor.
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go off the scene one of
[2:35:50] these days. I don't know when, but I
[2:35:52] it's just it's inevitable.
[2:35:55] If the Lord carries, some of us won't be
[2:35:58] here next week,
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; It's happening. David McGary, they asked
[2:36:03] him, they called him the elder. And he
[2:36:05] said, "Don't say elder because that
[2:36:06] means the next one that's going to go
[2:36:08] missing."
[2:36:11] [laughter] So, they called him the
[2:36:13] youngest elder.
[2:36:18] I realize it's just a few more days of
[2:36:21] the sun.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; It's just part of life.
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; I've I've poured out my heart to you
[2:36:32] this morning.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; And I want all of you to realize I can't
[2:36:37] carry this load myself.
[2:36:42] It's too rough. it. I become
[2:36:45] overburdened.
[2:36:47] It's too heavy. I can't I can't do it.
[2:36:51] Is there somebody here that says,
[2:36:52] "Brother Ron, I'll help carry it.
[2:36:59] I'll help carry the log."
[2:37:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:37:08] Is there anyone else that'll stand with
[2:37:10] brother Sean?
[2:37:13] Say, "I got your back."
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; I'll carry the Lord.
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; You young man,
[2:37:39] just a few days ago, you were born.
[2:37:45] The first baby born after I became
[2:37:47] pastor this year. How old are you now?
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; 32.
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; 32.
[2:37:57] Look at these guys. Huh?
[2:38:00] You guys were the young kids when we
[2:38:03] went out and we went quail hunting. Huh?
[2:38:06] I had James Laval as my personal bird
[2:38:08] dog.
[2:38:10] I'd shoot it. He ran what it want. He'd
[2:38:12] go and get the bird and come bring it
[2:38:14] back. Put it in my little pouch.
[2:38:16] We have grown up together. You realize
[2:38:18] it, Stephen. Jonathan,
[2:38:21] we've grown up together.
[2:38:23] I'm getting to be an old man. Now you
[2:38:26] guys.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:41] I want to [singing] live
[2:38:46] the way

[2:38:52] to live.
[2:38:54] I want to give [singing]

[2:41:54] morning.

[2:43:40] is stripped away
[2:43:42] and I simply [music] come,
[2:43:50] &gt;&gt; longing just to bring [music]
[2:43:54] something as a
[2:43:57] that will bless your heart.
[2:44:04] I'll bring you more than a song [music]
[2:44:08] for a song in itself is [singing] not
[2:44:12] what you have required.
[2:44:18] You search much deeper within
[2:44:23] through the way things appear.
[2:44:26] You're [music] looking [singing] into my
[2:44:29] heart.
[2:44:33] I'm coming [music and singing] back to
[2:44:36] the heart of worship.
[2:44:40] And it's all about [singing and music]
[2:44:42] you.
[2:44:44] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:44:48] I'm sorry, Lord,
[2:44:50] &gt;&gt; for the things [music and singing] I
[2:44:53] fed.
[2:44:54] Cuz it's all about you.
[2:44:58] &gt;&gt; It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:45:11] King of endless world.
[2:45:15] No one [singing] could express
[2:45:18] how much you deserve.
[2:45:26] Though I'm weak and [music and singing]
[2:45:27] poor,
[2:45:30] all I have is yours.
[2:45:33] Every single breath
[2:45:37] [singing and music]
[2:45:39] I'll bring you more than a song. [music]
[2:45:44] For a song in itself is not what
[2:45:48] [music and singing] you ask require.
[2:45:54] You search much deeper
[2:45:56] [music and singing]
[2:45:56] within
[2:45:58] through the way things appear. You're
[2:46:02] looking [music] into my [singing] heart.
[2:46:08] I'm coming [music and singing] back to
[2:46:11] the heart of worship.
[2:46:15] And it's all about [singing]
[2:46:16] you.
[2:46:19] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:46:23] I'm sorry, [music]
[2:46:24] Lord, for the things I've [singing]
[2:46:28] made it. When it's all about you,
[2:46:33] it's all [music and singing] about you,
[2:46:36] Jesus.
[2:46:38] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[2:46:44] And it's all [music and singing] about
[2:46:46] you.
[2:46:48] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:46:53] [music] I'm coming [singing]
[2:46:54] for the things I've made.
[2:46:59] When it's all about you,
[2:47:03] it's all about you, [music] Jesus.
[2:47:07] I'm coming back to the heart
