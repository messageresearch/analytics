In a praise report, it said on Monday afternoon, Sophia Berameck was rushed to the hospital. She began to have headaches and she'd lost sight in her left eye. So, as we began to pray, not knowing if it was temporary or not. That night, she was able to go home. It was only a migraine. So, we're thankful that Lord was with Sophia and touched her in that situation. [Music] Sister Audre Alice turned in a prayer request tonight. It says, "My aunt's kid just recently passed away and she is also terribly ill but isn't able to get help where she lives. So, we were flying her somewhere else.

Just uh want to pass a greeting along from the saints in Melbourne, Australia again. Um we were here and had a chance to sojourn with you for a little while and know a lot of the other saints around North America and just uh the family of God is something unbelievable. I I sometimes think we take for granted what we have. No, we really do. And uh the family of God is just something you can't explain to the people of this world. You really can't. So just want to extend greetings from our pastor in Melbourne, Australia as well. And uh I just want to let's bring these needs before the Lord right now. Precious heavenly father.

And Lord, you know each and every one of them, Lord God. You know them intimately, Lord God. You know exactly what's needed, Lord God. I just come before you right now asking that you'd come on the scene for each of these needs, Lord God. And I just ask that you'd make these needs, Lord God, into a praise report next week, Lord God. Just that we could hear the wonderful things that you've done, Lord. And Father, I just pray that you would uh bless each one, Lord, that is gathered here this evening. Heavenly Father, just move upon the scene, Lord God. Most importantly, Lord God, just bring us each to a closer walk with you, Lord God.

We just pray that you'd come on the scene now, Lord. We thank you for your mercy. We thank you for your grace. We thank you for this time together tonight, Lord. Lord, what else would we do?

Oh, I want to see him look upon his face. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sing that tonight. [Music] As I journeying through the land, singing as I go, pointing souls to Calvary to the crimson flow. Many arrows pierce my soul from without. Oh, but my Lord, he leads me on. Through him, I must win. And oh, I want to see him. Look upon his face and there to sing forever of his saving grace and on the streets of glory. Let me lift my voice. Oh cares will pass home at last ever to rejoice when it's service for my Lord.

Oh, so pass where home at last ever to sing the course again. Oh, I want to see him look upon his face and there to sing forever of his saving grace on the streets of glory. Oh, cares will pass at last ever to rejoice. [Music] Talk about happy. Oh, I'm so happy since I've laid my burden down. Talk about happy. Well, I'm so happy. Since I've laid my burden down, I feel like shouting, "Oh, halleluah." Since I laid my burden down, I feel like shouting. Oh, hallelujah. Since I've laid my burden down, I'm going to walk on those streets of glory. Since I've laid my burden down, I'm going to walk on the streets of glory.

One night while on life's raging sea it looked at it I would suffer defeat as a blackness of night. It closed off the light. My heart sank with fear. My desperate cry rang out with fright. All I could see was no hope in sight. With faith and gone. Oh, I met the one came looking for me. He came looking for me. He came looking for me. Oh, he made a way when there was no way that I could see. When I drifted so far, Jesus was here to rescue my soul. Calm all my fear. Since I met the one who came looking for me, Satan had already picked out my grave. His planet moved forward to put me away. I drifted so far. Would anyone care that I be lost? [Music] I knew my destruction was a matter of time. Jesus appeared, said, "This one is mine. Now I'm saved with no harm. He walked through the storm, came looking for me." He came looking for me. He came looking for me. Oh, he made a way when there was no way that I could see. I drifted so far. But Jesus was here to rescue my soul, calm all my fear. Now I'm safe from all harm. I met the one who took me. I'm safe from all harm now. I'm safe from all harm since I met the one who came looking for me. Give him praise tonight. Thank you, Lord, that you came looking for each one of us, Father. Thank you for your mercy and your grace. Every praise is to our God. Every word of worship. Let's stand tonight. Let's sing that. Give him praise tonight. Amen. Every praise is to our God. Oh, every word of worship in one accord. Every praise, every praise is to our God. [Music] Sing hallelujah to our God.

Lord, we thank you, Father. So glad that he's promised to go with us each step of the way, to take us through the fire. No matter what trial you're facing tonight, he's there to take you through. Amen. Just as we prepare to turn the service to brother Warren, let's sing that. Amen. He never promised the cross would not get heavy. Amen. &gt;&gt; He never promised that the cross would not get heavy, and the hill would not be hard to climb. He never offered a victory without fighting. He said, "Help always come in time." Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says, "Give in. Just hold on. Our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire. If you have a need tonight, lift it to him as we sing it again. He never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be harder to climb. He never offered a victory without fighting. He said help would always come in time. Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give in. Just hold on. Our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire. Sing it one more time tonight. [Music] He never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. [Music] He never offered a victory without fighting. He said help would always come in time. Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary said, "Give it. Just hold on. Our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hold on. [Music] Our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just hold on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it this is not our fight. It's his fight. &gt;&gt; We're just here to advertise his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul said he said when when he wrote in the book of the Corinthians he said I can see my face like blurry not clearly but he said one day I will see him face to face. This message, my brother and sisters, will bring us from glory unto glory, &gt;&gt; from glory unto glory &gt;&gt; until we see him face to face. &gt;&gt; If it's not open to you right now, just pray &gt;&gt; because God will open it to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, in the in the old um in the time of Paul, the mirror was not a mirror like this that the mirror that we look over there at the office. The mirror is like a steel, a shiny steel. It's not clearly, it's blurry. &gt;&gt; But one day, &gt;&gt; we will see him face to face. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Can we sing? From glory unto glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From glory to glory. He's changing me. He's changing me. He's changing me. His life is perfect in me. The love of God shown through the world. Oh, he's changing changing me from earthly things to the heavenly. His likeness and image to perfect in me. The love of God shown to the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe we will have a church tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we went to to uh Disneyland with my kids, we went to the uh theater and it was a 3D theater and the 3D was like in front of you. The Lego is in front of me and every time the Lego will come I was like move back you know move backward because it looks real. &gt;&gt; So now this message looks real. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said you know the the Bible said that this we have a sure word of prophecy. &gt;&gt; This message gave us a sure word of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. From partial realization to a perfect realization &gt;&gt; because the Bible said, &gt;&gt; he completed when when when uh when uh the disciples was asking Jesus, they said, "Well, uh is it Elijah will come first?" And Jesus said, "He came already." Amen. &gt;&gt; And people were blinded by their denominational ideas. &gt;&gt; But to us, Revelation 10:7 said, "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, &gt;&gt; all the mysteries &gt;&gt; will be finished." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he said, Elijah will come and restore all things. We are here right now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, before you sit, let's let's read the Thank you so much, musicians. Deuteronomy 23:3. Thank you, brother Juan, once again for allowing me to stand behind the pulpit. And thank you for coming on Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The title of the message is Ruth from Forbidden to Foundation. Amen. From forbidden to foundation. Deuteronomy 23 verse three to 4. An Ammonite or Moabitete shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord, even to their 10th generation. Shall they not enter into the congregation of the Lord forever? because they meet you not with bread and with water in the way. When ye came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired against thee Balam the son of Bure and Ptor of Ptor of Mesopotamia to curse thee. May the Lord add these blessings. Uh you may be seated. Amen. Pray for me. I'm shaking. Praise the Lord. Now, from forbidden to foundation. That's a a hard thought, but I was thinking I made two uh messages since two weeks ago. I was ready to preach for my other message until this morning. I changed it. Now back to the beginning. But the good thing is I studied two messages last three weeks ago. Amen. So an Ammonite or Moabitete shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord even to their 10th generation. The Moabitete cannot enter into the congregation of the Lord for 400 years. Think about that. That was God himself told to Moses. Because of what? First, they refused to offer food and water to the children of Israel when they came out from Egypt. You know, God is a good God. God is a gentleman. &gt;&gt; He said, "If if my if if the children of Israel, let's say their animals will eat your plants, the children of Israel will pay. They will not going to give burden to this country but then instead they refuse to offer food and drinks to the children of Israel. Second, they hired Balam to curse Israel. not only giving them food and shelter or water, but then at the same time they hired a prophet to curse Israel. But they cannot reverse what God gave them to bless them. Even Even the prophet can pray for that, he cannot reverse it because the word of God is final. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message is final. That's right. &gt;&gt; He cannot change his word. So now if you hundreds and hundreds of years past here was Naomi and Abec and Mahalon and Helion. This family there was a famine in the promised land. the the the the land that flows with milk and honey, there was a famine. But here were where uh the the family run away from the promise. And when they run away, brothers and sister, what will happen if you run away from the word? Pestilence will follow you. something wrong will happen to the family. &gt;&gt; Now once you come out from the message, you know what the first thing you do? You cut your hair. &gt;&gt; What the first thing you do? You rebel to the ministers of the church. Now once you rebel to the ministers of the church now they will start gossiping about the church until until Satan will consume you. So this is what happened to Alimc. He died. But then you know sometimes if you think about the message of the Lord, thank God for the message because you can put that in Romans 8:28. For God all things work together for the good &gt;&gt; to them that love God. &gt;&gt; So now is it a mistake to go to go to to Moab? To me, it's not because somebody is waiting over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To share the word of God that there's a land in Israel &gt;&gt; and there's a man waiting for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At Boas, can I take up my Thank you, brother Mark. God bless you, brother Eric. So here was Ruth the 1 12. I will read from forbidden. Turn away from me. Don't call me Naomi anymore. Just call me Mara full of bitterness. Said just go away. go find your husband in Moab. But then he said, "For I am too old to have a h a an husband. If I should say I have hope, if I should have an husband also tonight and should also bear a son, what ye ter would ye stay for uh from them or stay for them from having a husband?" Nay. My daughters, for it grieveth me much for sake for your sakes that he hand the hand of the Lord is gone out against me. And then and they lifted up their voice and weep again and Orpa kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth claved unto her. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's something in root that there's something that deep call it unto the deep &gt;&gt; that without you the blessing is in you. &gt;&gt; I need I need to cling in you. So here, and behold, she said, "My sister-in-law is gone back into her people, and unto her gods. Return thou after thy sister-in-law." And Ruth said, "Treat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee, for whether thou goest, I will go." Amen. &gt;&gt; And whether thou lodges, I will lodge. Thy people shall be my people, and thy God, my God. &gt;&gt; See that statement? &gt;&gt; Entreat me. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that. Noi, I want to I want to live with you. I want to I want your people to be my people. &gt;&gt; I want your God to be my God. But here's Orpa went to her gods &gt;&gt; and the prophet said she was ex not exterminated but excommunicated. That decision Ruth 11:16 that decision changed the whole thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; That decision, she became a born again Christian. &gt;&gt; I will die. &gt;&gt; Where you die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where thou diest, I will die. And where will I be buried, the Lord do so to me, and bore also. If ought but debt part thee and me my that was a statement only debt shall separate me from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. H and it changed the whole picture that that forbidden from from a cursed woman that you cannot enter into the congregation of the Lord for 400 years. It changed the whole thing because of her decision. Think about when you decided when you decided to to follow the cross of Jesus, &gt;&gt; it changed the whole thing. &gt;&gt; It changed your attitude &gt;&gt; from street walker to a saint, &gt;&gt; from prostitute, from adulterer, from a killer. No one was good with us before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No one. Because every child that's born here on earth is already a sinner. &gt;&gt; But it changed the whole thing when we said I will follow you. &gt;&gt; I will die. This is this is only death do a part. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ruth the Moabitete became Mrs. Boas. It changed her address. &gt;&gt; My Matthew 15. This is the generation of Jesus Christ. And Salmon begat Boas of Rahab. And Boaz begat Oed of Ruth. And Oed begat Jesse. And Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat Solomon of her that had been wife of Urias. See that generation from Obed from Obed to Jesse and Jesse to David only third generation. But here was David and uh uh six and Jesse begat David and uh the king and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias. So here is David. I want you to see this. When I saw this I was rejoicing that it's amazing grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's only by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the um 1st Samuel 23 uh 21:3. I don't know if you don't if you have that but so 1st Samuel 21 chapter 3 or verse three the story was the story was David was running and he was so hungry and you cannot the the the generation of Ruth cannot enter into the congregation of the Lord. But here was David was hungry and he ran and he cannot find the food. So what he did? He went he went to the temple and asked the high priest give me food to eat. But here was the high priest. First thing, that's a a bad idea to go to the temple. Second, only the the the Levites can eat the showbread or the hollow bread. Now, only Aaron's children or sons are allowed to eat that hollow bread. If you are not a Levite, you cannot eat that bread. But here in Matthew 12:3-4, the far Pharisee was asking Jesus and here was Jesus quoting the scripture of sec or f first Samuel. He said in Matthew 12 uh 12:3-4, "But he said unto them, have ye not read what David did when he was unhungered, and they that were with him, how he entered into the house of God, and did eat the showbread, which was not lawful. which was not lawful. It's against the law for him to eat neither for them which were with him but only for the priest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; First of all, your lineage is not welcome to enter the the temple of the Lord. But David broke everything, broke every law. He said I will enter and give me showbre my it's all about the grace of God. &gt;&gt; But because of that decision of Ruth it changed the whole thing. Marriage changed the whole thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you need to be to be one with Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. You know, every time he sees this, the people that don't care about the Lord, the wrath of God, he's angry. But the only thing that can stop between you and God for his for his uh uh uh wrath is his blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you became one with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, David entered into the temple of the Lord. Now here the son of David Solomon not only he entered into the temple of the Lord but then God or David and God want Solomon to build his temple. 1 Chronicles 28:5-7, this is David, he said, "And of all my sons, for the Lord hath given me many sons, he had chosen Solomon, my son, to sit upon the throne to the kingdom of the Lord over Israel." And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. Moreover, I will establish his kingdom forever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day. Now, only the holy hands can build the temple. When we were pre when I was preaching last time, you know what happened to Solomon? He worshiped the gods and goddesses of his wives. But then it's all about the grace and mercy of God. Where where was Solomon came from? From Bacha. And what did David do to to Bacha? He killed Uriah because he likes Bacha and he put judgment. You know when when Nathan was was uh when when God told to Nathan to go to David, he said, "David, I I will there was a a rich man and and a poor man. The rich man have you know uh sheep and uh cattle, but here's the poor man. He has only one ulu lamb. And this u lamb he feed this lamb and he treated this lamb like his baby. But then he said that at the same time this lamb sleep with him. But this rich man saw there was a visitor in his kingdom and instead to kill one of his sheep. He took that lamb and offered it to the visitor. And David while he was listening, he he he stood up and said, "That man must be killed. He put judgment to himself." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that that that Nathan said, "That's you, David. Y &gt;&gt; you have had 500 wives and you took the lamb &gt;&gt; of Uriah. See, it's it's it's all about amazing grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God will will allow David, our Solomon that came out from sin &gt;&gt; to build his temple &gt;&gt; because of Ruth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of her decision, my the prophet said, "It's no merits of your own, &gt;&gt; but it's the unconditional election and calling of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't have holiness in my own self. &gt;&gt; N &gt;&gt; my holiness is him. And salvation is the merits of Jesus Christ and nothing that any individual could do. &gt;&gt; God by his love saved man. &gt;&gt; Not what man could do. Nada. No. There's nothing you could do about it. You couldn't even save a nature to long for God &gt;&gt; or you don't even have a a nature to long for God because you're a sinner. &gt;&gt; So no man has sought God at any time. &gt;&gt; But God sought man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I cannot see any like like a a spot in you if I look at you because I God did not call me to judge. So we cannot judge. We cannot judge the book by its cover. You need to read the inside &gt;&gt; because what if this man, yes, he's weak. Yes, he's a sinner. But deep inside of him, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's hiding, asking for sorry for what he did. &gt;&gt; It is not you, but it's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. When David did that, when Nathan told him, you are that man. You know the good thing of David, he can repent of what he's doing. &gt;&gt; In Psalms 51 said he he he he cried unto the Lord. He said, "Create me a clean heart, oh God, &gt;&gt; and renew a right spirit in me. &gt;&gt; Cast me not away from thy presence." &gt;&gt; But what is that again? But but uh but uh deliver me from evil. And here's the good thing. He said, "Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why he he did not ask God to restore his salvation? &gt;&gt; Because God's salvation is unconditional. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; If you are saved, the prophet said, you are saved from time to eternity. &gt;&gt; You don't ask for your salvation. God gave you a salvation for free. That's why David had a revelation. So he's he was worshiping and praying God restore unto me the joy. &gt;&gt; I lost the joy but not my salvation. &gt;&gt; David, he is God's own heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here was David. Did we read? Uh I think I did not read this. Okay. And today God has made a contract. Not because you were good, not because you had joined church. Joining church is not nothing to do with it, brothers. You're going to church because you love him. &gt;&gt; This is not the law. &gt;&gt; Not because you have been a good rank in society. You can be ever so good. You can live a clean life. You can go to church every day. We go to church only Wednesday and Sunday. But you can go to church every day. You can sacrifice every day. You can give a part of your money. You can give up all the sins of the world and everything and live just as true, as faithful as you can. And you will miss heaven. Though I speak with men and of of angels, though I give my my body to be burned, &gt;&gt; it profits me nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need the love of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you will miss heaven just as far as east is from the west. That's right. It isn't by your goodness what we are saved, but it's by his mercy that we are bought. &gt;&gt; That God wanted to make sons and daughters. Goodness never makes them. The spirit of God makes them. &gt;&gt; It wasn't so, he wouldn't have had to send the Holy Ghost. That's why we need the Holy Ghost every day. &gt;&gt; But as brother Ru one was preaching for the last two weeks that this Holy Ghost needs to penetrate to the to the not to the twin tower but to the to the what do you call that brother uh Mark? The the the &gt;&gt; the control tower twin tower. Amen. So, here's the son of David. The son of David. The son of David is Jesus Christ. From root, from forbidden to foundation. See, now here is the son of David. When he came, where he come from? From heaven. The logos, the great logos that came out from God. Became man. He be he become a theophony and the theophony become man. So he become Jesus Christ become the temple of the of the holy ghost become the temple of the father. The prophet said the great Jehovah God made manifest in flesh. We found him to be not a prophet but the fullness of the godhead bodily. He was Jehovah made flesh and the body Jesus only tabernacled him. God dwelling in man. God being reconciled to man through man by the virgin birth of his son. And Jehovah the spirit dwelleth in him. David, he went to the temple of the Lord and eat the showbread. Solomon, he he built the temple of the Lord. Jesus, God's own or God's own tabernacle, the theophony of God become man. the logos that went out of God which become the theophony and then the theophony was made absolutely human flesh Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here was God become become a a a a person that they said, "Well, he he's an illegitimate child." There there's no record in the society that they come from a good family. But God choose the meek and lowly. &gt;&gt; God choose you and me. &gt;&gt; You search me from the internet. Maybe you will not find me. Like as my my my boss said, don't you know my name is in the who's who in in in America? I said, wow. Who's who in America? Yeah. Go search in the internet. You will see my name. Who's who in America? You cannot find me. Who's who in America? Brother Paul, maybe you are because you are a popular pickle ball player. There's no record who's who in America, but you can find your name. Who's who in heaven? &gt;&gt; I told my boss, I said, "But you will see my name. Who's who in heaven?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Never heard that before. &gt;&gt; Yes. And the Bible said, "And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness. God was manifested or manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit. Sin of angels preached unto Gentiles. unto the Gentiles believe on in the world receive up into glory. Great is the mystery God manifest in flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God tabernacled in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's I'm I'm I'm I'm uh going to to our days because this is powerful. In Luke 17:20-21, the Pharisees was asking Jesus and they uh they said, "And when he was demanded of the uh Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come, &gt;&gt; he answered them and said, the kingdom of God cometh not with observation, neither shall they say, lo here or lo there, for behold the kingdom of God is within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we are the children &gt;&gt; of Abraham through Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now from from David to Solomon and Solomon to Jesus. And now we are part of the generation of Ruth. Brother David, I will not be surprised if you stand and say Gloria. So now the kingdom of God is within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Into the Greek word said in the kingdom of God is within inos. It means it's inside of you. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is inside of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now here was the Pharisees. You know why they were talking about show me the the uh the kingdom of God? Because according to the Pharisees, you know, the denominations, they're expecting a grand visible event. &gt;&gt; Tell me when is the kingdom come? So that we can prepare. Is that the denomination of today? The prophet said they come and they they prayed and they said fast and pray fast and pray. There's something is going to happen. I want you to fast and pray. And then pro the prophet said they forgot the the the uh uh what do you call that the the uh they're waiting for a big event but God came in a very simple way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But because they it's against to their religion and belief they cannot accept it. Fast and pray. Fast and pray. The prophet said here in the message recognizing your day. Oh, fast and pray. We're going to have a great breaking of the day. There is a great thing going to happen. All of you. Pray. Pray. Pray. You're not too late yet. Like what's going on right now. According to brother Amos, the the turning point buildings are like miles of flowers and and flags because they martyed Charlie Kirk. See the the the the revival right now of the denominations. Let's let's heat up. Let's move on. Let's pray to God. Let's let's uh uh let's have a revival. But they forgot that there's a message group of people here in the valley that they didn't even recognize. &gt;&gt; Why? Why they do that? Why do they do that? They want a great awakening. They're crying believing that there will be an awakening. They're good. Of course, they're good people. &gt;&gt; Don't you know the denomination send help donation to all over the world in Africa and Asia? They want to save a kid from p poverty so that the kid at the same time will indoctrinate that you will accept Jesus. But as brother Ron said, who? There's so many Jesuses. &gt;&gt; They can worship in spirit but not in truth. &gt;&gt; Because the truth will bring you back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Past they're good people. Why is it? What have they done? They have not feel that pull of the of the hour. They haven't recognized what's been done. That's what that's that's making them feel that way. They know something is supposed to happened. But see, they're looking for it way of in the future to uh future to come when it's already happened right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride hath made herself ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for a revival. The revival is in me. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for something will happen. Brother David. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is in us. &gt;&gt; God tabernacled in us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, what is the kingdom of God? The kingdom of God is the Holy Spirit in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. They miss it. My neighbor one time, he's a he's a a a denominational preacher. He said, "If you can come with me, um we will have a show uh in our church." So I said, "Uh what is it? Uh it's uh the mark of the beast movie." So I said, "Okay, I will go." So I was watching the mark of the beast. The actor was Gary Buucy. I don't know if you never know or never heard of Gary Buucy but he was a an actor Hollywood actor. So now I was watching and then when they done they they inviting people to watch so that now after the movie they will introduce the religion. So they started worshiping after the movie and then they started speaking in tongue la. So I don't know you you you're doing good with that brother. So now he was doing walking and then while he was uh the guy that invited me he was walking and then he said are you good? Uh you need water? You want water? No, no, no, no. And he was like talking and asking, you're doing good. So, and I said, this is this is a shame. The people that don't they know God, but they don't know how to worship God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or they don't know God either. They know God from their leaders, from the denominational creed and ideas. This is my boss uh before uh brother brother Ray was our supervisor. Brother Mario called me said, "Hey, do you want to lift weights?" I said yes. Uh but this one is uh they will pay you while lifting weights. Okay, good. So we went to it was a big church here in 67th and Happy Valley. So brother Ray is our supervisor and we were cleaning a a humongous church. It was a like a a thousand of of seats. But other than that, there's another uh uh church beside that church. It's for the kids. And every Friday, they put a red carpet. And we come every Friday night and we cleaned. And I was like, why there's so many Coke in cans and Starbucks? Is it Starbucks? It was Starbucks, right? so many Starbucks under the chairs. And so the we asked the one of the of the uh deacons I think or one of the member of the church that was watching us said every Friday night it's a movie night. So this Friday we're watching Avenger. So that's how they gather the people. They will invite people to watch Avenger for free with Starbucks and Coke with popcorns. So I resigned brother Ray after I think a month but I gained muscles because we were like cleaning with a we vacuumed the whole church. That was good. So that's the denomination. They missed the coming of the Lord. The prophet said in uh uh to the you know to the to the Jews, he said God blinded the Jews so that it will open the eyes of the Gentiles. But then God blinded the Gentiles so that the bride will open and come in the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are rejoicing right now. Our worship is different from the worship of the denomination. because we feel the the the the presence of the Lord every time you cry out to God, &gt;&gt; every time you speak the name of Jesus, &gt;&gt; your worship is different from them. Their their worship is by education. Our worship is by spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Good. We're still have time. The prophet said, "Now we're living in another age." I love this age. Don't you? Now God has a mercy seat today &gt;&gt; to be guarded. You believe that? Where's the mercy seat found? In the heart of men. Where is the temple found? In the heart of man. Where's the kingdom found? In the heart of man. Where did it come in the heart of men at that day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost which is God come into the human heart? Is that right? So it started in the Pentecost. Now in Colossians Paul said I will give you a great mystery. The mystery that I will show it to you. He said is Christ in you in us in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. &gt;&gt; That's why we have hope. &gt;&gt; We can glorify God in a different way than the denominations. Now the prophet said now and he said the kingdom of God will be within you. So therefore, the legions and powers and the backing of the holy angels, hallelujah, is in you tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The backing of the holy angels is in you tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the deity of Christ, by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Yes, sir. Who are you this uh tonight? this morning but tonight. And he claps his hand together two times. He said, "Who is Christ Jesus? He is in you as much as you will let him be." &gt;&gt; It's like automatic. &gt;&gt; Like when you sit in my Tesla, it's automatic. It will bring you to your destination. See, you don't you don't ask for the Holy Ghost or for the Holy Spirit or for the angels to watch you. It's automatic &gt;&gt; when you once you accepted him, when you are part of the generation of Ruth, &gt;&gt; the holy angels is backing you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; my brother. He's pressing trying to get into you to move into you today and you stand up and wonder and look and gaze and hold back a little while. Don't do that. Move right straight into the bosom of God. &gt;&gt; The hour is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The people, the churches are looking for the miracles. The miracle is here. &gt;&gt; God is in his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Into tabernacle. You are the kingdom of God. For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink. It's better than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. But righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; the the food and drinks, it's good. But the righteousness of God and the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; that is the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have joy in me, &gt;&gt; that no one can give. &gt;&gt; I have peace in me that no one can give. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I am sick, I have peace in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I am dying, I have peace in me. &gt;&gt; One day, my patient was dying and he told me, "Don't go away. Be with me." And when he started gasping his breath, he hold my hand tight. And I was so scared. First time I saw a man died. That was a long time ago. And while he was dying, I keep pressing the the coal light. Keep pressing the cold light. Hey, somebody come here. But no one came until he died. But he was like moving and uh doing things like throwing his pillow. Doesn't want to die. And his daughter said, "Oh, my my daddy." You know why he he he was acting like that? Because the next day it's his anniversary, wedding anniversary. He was waiting for his wedding anniversary. That's why he want he don't doesn't want to die. See, but to the Christians, I have peace. I have peace in me if I'm dying. Because you know why? Because the real life I will see God face to face. &gt;&gt; I will see my loved ones. I will see the prophet. I will see John. And I will see Paul. &gt;&gt; There's no need to fear. We have peace in our heart. &gt;&gt; If the if God is in you. Amen. I'm done. If the musician can come, he said in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 1922, "Now therefore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God. And you are built upon the for the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Here is the temple of God. You are built of the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly prayed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord. &gt;&gt; In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now you know my purpose here, brother David. I know your purpose here. to be a worshshiper of God. This temple to be used to worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if you don't worship, I'm sorry, David. God will raise up a stone. Will you take this the place of the stone? That's why this worship is between you and God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed to your neighbor and say, "Oh, maybe he will see me crying. I'm ashamed of myself." &gt;&gt; No. This worship has a purpose. &gt;&gt; Your worship is real. &gt;&gt; To give praise unto the Lord. I don't care of my neighbors. &gt;&gt; I want to worship him, my creator. &gt;&gt; He used this temple for a purpose. &gt;&gt; To offer sacrifice of praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. John 14:20. Let's stand up. At that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me. Ye in me and I in you and I in you [Music] on that day at that day. Now maybe you think maybe the next revival. Maybe you think well maybe if my if my my son will graduate from college or maybe if God will talk to me tonight. No, today is your day &gt;&gt; at that day. Today is that day &gt;&gt; that God and you and you in me become one. It's a marriage. When Ruth decided to follow Naomi, it was a decision that it changed the whole thing. It took away the curse of Moabitete because of her decision. &gt;&gt; What is your decision tonight? &gt;&gt; To me, my decision tonight is to be a different people of a different person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to come out in this church a different person from glory. &gt;&gt; The next Sunday to glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The next week to glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Until God will take us home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts. Father, it's a simple message, Lord, that I want to share to your people. And Lord, thank you so much for allowing me to to go to this route. Father, I know, Lord, it's it's your time to to share this word. Maybe there's somebody here, Father, that's that's uh confused of his situation. [Music] If I can touch through your Holy Spirit, that person, Father, it's enough for me because it's not us, Lord. This is this vessel is just for your use, Lord. So bless your people tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes. bless this church and all the the believers. Our pastor, brother Ron, may you use his vessel, Lord God, for your glory. &gt;&gt; And use us, Lord, for your for your glory. &gt;&gt; We want to offer this this temple as a sacrifice of praise to you, Father. We love you, Lord. We give you praise. And Lord, to the believers that are listening through the internet, Father, may your Holy Spirit touch them. You bless them, Father. That I believe, Lord, one of these days, this efforts, this burden, Lord God, this trials, we will overcome &gt;&gt; and you will bring us to glory. &gt;&gt; We love you in Jesus Christ's name.
