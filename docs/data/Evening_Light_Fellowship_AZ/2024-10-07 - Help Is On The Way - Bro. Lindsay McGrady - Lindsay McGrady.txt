he give us the opportunity to cast our cares upon Him for he cares for us right amen thank God I appreciate it so much such a privilege to be here and I've got to apologize to the brother's back working the overhead because me and the Lord had a wrestling match this morning I sent them my notes last night and I know if I did it the Lord was going to probably change it and he did so Brothers just just SC wrap it put it all just all over in File 13 we're going a different direction and listen I know I've learned if you're going to wrestle the Lord he's going to win and it's always for the best right you know I'm like but Lord I I hadn't prepared this I'm not ready with this it don't matter he does the work anyway if I'm trying to do it it'll never get done right it will it'll never happen but he does it praise God so while you're standing just turn with me over to the Book of Daniel the 10th chapter and I count it an honor and a privilege to be here with you this morning with the Believers I love the presence of the Lord every time I walk in here it's just a A Little Piece of Heaven and uh it is it just it's a blessing to me and listen I can sit in the congregation and be just as blessed probably more blessed than than being up here and and uh but you know we we submit to the Lord whatever the Lord desires uh I apologize to those of you that made the marriage banquet there on Friday night I I felt like I just fumbled all over the place my mouth was so dry the words were stuck in my mouth I could not say irreconcilable I can say it now I couldn't say it the other night you know I I I tried and tried and tried over I can't I just wanted y'all to know that I can say that word irreconcilable but but it just stuck in my mou mouth you know just my mouth was dry and I couldn't get that word out and I just fumbled all over the place but we're trusting the Lord amen Daniel the 10th chapter I want to read the first three verses then drop down 10 through 13 it says in the third year of Cyrus King of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel whose name was belthazar and the thing was true and the same the but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and he had understanding of the vision in those days I Daniel was in morning three full weeks I ate no Pleasant bread neither came flesh or wine in my mouth neither did IO anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were fulfilled down to the 10th verse it says and behold a hand touched me which set me up on my knees and upon the palms of my hands and he said to me oh Daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that I speak unto thee and stand upright unto thee am I now sent and when he had spoken this this word unto me I stood trembling and he said unto me fear not Daniel from from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy God thy words were heard and I am come for thy words Lord but the prin of the kingdom of Persia with stod me one and 20 days but Lo Michael one of the chief princes came to me and I remained there with the King of Persia let's just bow our hearts for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we just come now Lord humbly before your presence God I feel your presence Lord you're here dear God lord I trust that everybody that's gathered here this morning that they feel that presence those that may be joining

the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and a church said amen God bless you may be seated this morning now before I jump into the word of the Lord I I I want to do something brother Ron didn't ask me to do this but I I know as we were at the marriage banquet uh the other night everybody IAL talked to knowing you know that we were from North Carolina the mountains of North Carolina they were asking me about you know the storm and so forth so I say this so that when I walk out of the pull pit and I see you outside I don't have to tell you I don't have to say the same thing you know 20 times again but uh you know the Lord really blessed us yeah we were in the very northwest corner of of North Carolina right where Virginia Tennessee in North Carolina come together up in the mountains and uh you know we we saw the hurricane we we knew that it was coming we had been warned that there was going to be some flash flooding but you know I really didn't understand the word flash flooding I really didn't think about it uh until now and now I have a a little bit of a better understanding of flash flooding and and it started raining I guess approximately Tuesday and it just rained constantly there and the ground it was raining hard but the ground was saturated and we're in the Hills and it's all heels and it runs off and uh I guess it was Thursday night F early Friday morning it really started raining it really hit and started raining really hard and the wind started blowing and and we really got the brunt of the Storm at that point and uh I went down early that morning we lived close to the river we're up on the hill but Liv close to River and I went down to see where's the river at you know is it in the road well I got out it was in the road it was over the bridges I turn around back to the house I listen to radio and they he said 5,000 people are houses without power and and we're a small County I think there's maybe 27,000 people in the entire County that we live in and then the next thing I hear it's 7,000 know it's going up we still had power and I thought well our eldest son he's got a basement it's totally submerged he's got a a sump pump and it's pump out the water as long as he's got electricity but so I told Sharon said I'm going to run over to my mom she's got a dad had a generator hadn't been started probably in 5 years if I can get it started I'll take it to Seth house and so we headed out that way and I took a gallon of gasoline got to Mom's house the little generator started right up loaded it up took it to my son's house about 10 minutes away and I asked him I unloaded it you know I said hey Seth you got any gasoline he said not really I was like okay this thing's not going to last very long in a gallon of gas so I got his gas can and I I I took off down the store there's a little convenience store maybe a mile or so from his house when I got there we just passed it when I got there off and I said oh okay so then I headed more into town all the light we just come through there all the lights are out it's dark so I headed back over toward my mom because there's three gas stations there get over there it's all dark and and I noticed then at the road he goes right out to my mom's house I looked out I turned around and the the creek that comes through it already covered the road and and so forth I was like oh no going to Mom's house I can't get to her house she was safe she wasn't in in any danger whatsoever but U you know I thought wow so I thought everything's closed I so I went back to my house 5 miles away cuz I had a 5 gallon can of gas got the gas and uh as I was coming back out I'm not too far from R the river but there's a big stream that runs down and it was just about out in the road and I thought wow we won't be able to get back home so I kept going and the time I started back over to my son's house this is all in 30 minutes time period you know there was wash outs in the road there was trees later I was driving around trees all the power is out and that's where I I learned you know just how much the water Rose so fast I said okay now I understand what a flash flood is because in 30 minutes everything everything had changed we were safe we got their basement pumped out and but you know just the devast I'm sure most of you seen it on the Internet it's you know it's it's real uh there may be some fake stuff out there but it's real and and we were fortunate we were blessed I think we were without electricity maybe for four hours but there's still people my in-laws Sharon's Mama dad he's 88 years old her mom's almost 85 they still don't have power they live almost in town so they've been over a week now without power and try to get them to stay with us and he's so obstinate difficult that he he don't want to do that but we finally got him to stay with us and so forth and uh but we took a generator last Monday in a grill up to one of the sisters in church it's very remote and we saw you know there used to be a house there used to be a trailer right there there used to be you know we saw houses were gone or where they used to be and uh roads that were wiped out power lines miles and miles and miles of power lines that were down and just it's incredible you know you just some places half the road was gone and just one lane road and you're driving around it and um it just unimaginable you know just hard to imagine I I'm 60 years old never see anything like it don't ever want to see like it again but um you know it I I guess I was amazed also by the outpour that we've received in the mountains I mean it's just truck after truck after truck TR after truck that's come in water Food Supplies cleaning supplies people volunteered I worked Wednesday at a a station uh where they were bringing in trucks we were offloading trucks sorting the product reboxing it sending it out into the neighborhoods and I was working with a guy that had come up from Raleigh and that's three and a half hours or thereabouts away from where we live and he's just there to volunteer I heard there's a guy over at our local Lowe's store that come from TS Oklahoma was out there fixing hot dogs for people and just you know so the outpouring has just been amazing and and we're thankful for that and a lot of people there that do need it that are trapped their homes but I'll ask you to remember in prayer that's it's great but you know these people as we were driving up we saw oil barrel after oil barrel in the river washed away or washed from homes and so we're getting ready to hit cold weather I know y'all don't have cold weather out here but we're getting ready to have cold weather it's cooling down and so those people don't even have a their heat Supply now so you know that's things that a lot of people hadn't thought about how are they going to get an oil barrel back to their house how they going to get it filled with oil how they going to get their furnace working you know gas tanks things like that nature and then a lot of these people they live in The Valleys they got a little stream they cross to get to their house or they cross the river or whatever and those bridges are gone and those aren't State Bridges those are private Bridges and so there's going to be a lot of work to do uh a lot of heavy lifting yet to do and so again I appreciate all that y'all are doing sending offerings I know brother Donnie's church is doing an amazing job with the Buri of coffee it's different ones and so appreciate that appreciate your prayers and so now I don't have to tell you all the story when we get done okay I hope I covered everything but yes it's it it it's quite amazing but let me go to the scripture this morning again where we started at here from The Book of Daniel the 10th chapter and Daniel being in division I want I want to take a little fault this morning Lord put on my heart on hold on help is on the way amen hold on thank you Lord help is on the way and I got a little bit of a reality of that just in our local County there with this flooding from uh hell and the the hurricane I've seen a video clip of a of a a gentleman that tried you know I can't understand people that Dy to drive through this murky muddy water to get somewhere you know don't do that maybe your life is in danger you do it if it's a life or death situation because it very well could be you're going to die trying to do it and so you just don't do that right but I saw a video clip of this gentleman was trying to drive through water there in our local County and he was actually trying to get the check on his parents um and his truck a little little Ranger truck it flooded out in the middle of the water he gets out and he's on the low side of the pickup and the water is hitting the upper side truck see he's protected I don't know how the little truck was not being moved but the of the water that was H it but his father has a little bit of a construction business and he took a he took a a backo and went out into the water the back ho and trying to get his son with a bucket of the back ho and the water started moving the backo out of the way and aidos keeps rolling and and the son gets into the back with his dad and it's washing down stream someone and it I I I've heard two different reports heard one they got out into a pine tree and and other I heard hey they were still in the cab of this uh this uh back ho but you see the water and you see about that much of the top of that back Co and and one person told me said yeah they were standing up there trying to get air and breathe but they took they got a boat out to rescue them uh and they rescued them and they but they were they were holding they were holding on and you know I can imagine you know if you're in that situation there was people that were in trees that they had to rescue out of trees and some people you know maybe they for hours waiting on someone to come and and to help them someone to come to get to them and and and to rescue them and you know they're holding on but you know you there's a point in time where your strength begins to diminish you begin to wonder my hey how much longer can I hold on and we you know I've heard stories of people that were in a tree maybe for seven hours and then they're gone they're gone they couldn't hold on any longer they and the and the waters swept them away and so forth and you know it's a tragedy I me but you know I I I look at that as a spiritual application also that a lot of you I mean we know the Bible talks about when the enemy comes in like a flood right he comes in like a flood into our lives and he tries to overwhelm us he tries to overflow us he tries to put more upon us than we can stand and we're bombarded and and and and thank God that scripture doesn't end that he comes in like a flood but it says the spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard against him amen aren't you glad there someone amen that whenever you're holding on for dear life that there's someone that is there amen he'll be there for you he's there in time amen you know anybody wants to tell you to give up to quit amen but hold on in this scripture that I read this morning here from Daniel it talks about Daniel and we know that he was in three weeks of prayer that first he had had vision and he was understanding the Captivity of Israel and and how that there was a limited time to that and was coming to an end and he had these vision and he went into mourning and and and fasting and seeking the Lord here the Bible says for three full weeks seeking you know what's going to happen but he says that he was there and we we we know the scriptures we read here that that uh as he had went out from this place that he was out at the Riverbanks and he's looking around and he sees someone and he has a vision here's the Lord Jesus Christ appearing to him amen you know you have to read the parts I didn't read amen and uh uh but he sees that and and and he trembles and he's like he's asleep he's he passes out in fear and the next thing you knows there's a there's a hand that touches him an angel had come to him this wasn't the the same one that he saw that he had a vision of that he was fearful of but this is an angel comes and touches Daniel and tells him rise up he said you know Daniel said said listen from the first day that you that you said your heart Amen to understand and to to chasten yourself to seek the Lord he said thy God thy words were heard amen and I have come because of your words but he goes on to tell him says now but the prince of the kingdom of Persia with stood stood me one in one in 20 days but Lo Michael one of the chief priests came to help me but remained there with the kings of Persia now you know I I don't know how your mind works but a lot of times when I'm reading something like this man I start getting mental pictures I don't know maybe you maybe you don't work that way but you know this it starts playing out in the you know the stage of my mind the things that are going on I'm envisioning it what's happening and so forth and and you know I've always had one way that I solve this but this morning I just want to talk about maybe three scenarios that happened here or could have happened uh in this situation where here is the angel trying to get to Daniel but the Prince of Persia of the kingdom of Persia is resisting him now the first scenario I I I want to go to I first let me scroll back here that very first verse Daniel CH chap first verse says it it tells us the time frame it says in the third year of cus King of Persia so that's Daniel setting the time frame but if we look we know that in Ezra the first chapter and the first verse it tells us now in the first year of Cyrus King of Persia that the word of the Lord came to the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King of Persia that he made a proclamation throughout all of his kingdom and put it also in the writing saying thus saith Cyrus King of Persia the Lord God Of Heaven have given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he have charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem in Judah amen so here's this this Syrian King if you would I mean now he's got a vision from the Lord to build rebuild the Temple that is in Jerusalem and so he sends a delegation as are different ones to go to Jerusalem to rebuild the Temple and uh we know that the responsibility of restructing the Temple it fell upon the governor of Judah which was zerubabel and upon the high priest which was josua that was the two people that was mainly I guess God had looked to to build this now and so this construction is going on this is two years before Daniel's having this vision and it's going on and we see this and and we we know amen that and I read this little clip it here from Matthew Henry's commentary he said that Cyrus's son chamus Prince of Persia had been very busy harassing the Affairs of the Jews and to do them all the Mischief he could and the angel had been all the time employed to counterwork him so he had been constrained to defer his visit to Daniel till now and so what the theory there is is okay here's in Jerusalem they're trying to rebuild the Temple and now there's this opposition that is going on to the building of the temple and the word here the angel that was going to come to Daniel now is been deployed to to to Jerusalem to fight against the opposition and things that are happening to stop the Temple construction you know I guess I had never really thought too much about that how that you know maybe that was even a possibility or whatever but we we find also there in the book of Ezra when you look at the fourth chapter and the first verse it says now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of captivity build the temple unto the Lord God of Israel then they came to zerubabel and to the chief of the fathers and said to them let us build with you for ye we for we seek your God as ye do and we do sacrifice unto him and so you know they're looking at hey let us come to but you notice that first verse said the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin and they saw work going on they saw a temple that was being rebuilt and so they come amen it it it reminds me of guess of uh the first sealing the white horse rider how that you know Satan disguising himself and and wanting to come in and and infiltrate in and and become a Believer because he can do damage when he does that right when he becomes in begins with his pretense he can he can can't call T and tell you brother on here's how you ought to run your church here's how what you ought to do and how hey there's people that will come in Satan will send people in under the disguise of being a Believer to tell somebody else hey you know what you don't work you don't need to worship that way you know you don't need to do that you don't need to pray you know that hey and that's what was going on here is these adversaries these Assyrians the the people of the land were coming to zeruel said hey let us build with you because you know we worship all after all we all worship the same God that's you know that that's what uh that's what happening and um it actually tells here that uh that they were of assur which is the Assyrians um the third verse says but B zerubu and jerus or excuse me and Joshua and the rest of the chief fathers of V said unto him ye have nothing to do with us Amen to build the house unto our God but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel as king Cyrus the king of the Persians have commanded us the fourth verse see this then the people land weakened the hands of the people of Judah and troubled them in building and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus King of Persia even un the reign of darus King of Persia so here it is now oh you so you want to accept and just you know join together with us you know the Pagan Rome coming Pap Rome and so forth let's just blend it all together that's that's what their their intent was and so they said no we're not going to we're not going to accept that So then whenever they couldn't come in and be accepted among them and said hey let's oppose them let's weaken the hands of the people in trying to build a temple of God and trying to construct this Temple and then they hired counselors you know we're we're going to frustrate their work amen we're going to hire counselors we're going to send them under king of uh Osirus here and tell them you know what these people they they're going to reject you as king and and so they were you know this whole thing is working it's the politics hey they had politics going on here and so this is where you see that all of a sudden there was opposition going on to the construction and where this Prince of Persia is coming and opposing the work and the the the powers of God are are turned to try to to resolve that now you know we see a lot of things happening in the natural but unfortunately we don't see what's going on behind the scenes spiritually like we should you know that and Satan wants to he wants us to see everything that everybody else is doing he wants us to see the problems he wants us to take everything at face value and at the natural level but we that we never look beyond that that we never see the spiritual aspect we never see the powers of Darkness that are working behind the scen but the scripture here tells us about the powers of Darkness that are working behind the scenes and that is in Zechariah the thir chapter Zechariah the 3 chapter the first verse and it says and he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing his right hand to to resist him so here's Joshua the high priest that is one of those people that has been given the responsibility to rebuild the Temple you building this Temple and it's showing us here in a spiritual realm that Satan is standing there resisting what he's trying to do amen you know here's Joshua and zerubba they look out they see the syrians they see the enemy they see what they're trying to do but yet in the spiritual realm there's a battle going on there's a resistance going on and so this angel that was trying to get to Daniel say you know the Prince of Persia he withstood me aen he got in the way he interfered in my ability to get to you because of all that was going on in Jerusalem and all that the the the rhetoric that was going on with uh uh uh Cyrus the King of Persia now listen if this uh depiction is correct can you imagine the spiritual battles that are happening right now amen right now in Israel whenever here's Iran firing what 181 ballistic missiles or whatever Hypersonic missiles toward Jerusalem toward Tel Aviv there's a battle going on but here you know Lebanon and Hezbollah and the hoies and uh whatever else they're all out there Hamas all trying to come against the people of Israel and you know I can imagine yes you know here we are we got our issues but I can believe that there's forces of God that have been deployed yeah we know that there's American troops there and we've got warships and we've got all these other things and so does Israel and so forth but I want you to know something we see that with a natural eye but in the spiritual realm there are powers amen that are at Battle right now over Israel amen there's powers of Darkness that want to destroy Israel there's powers of the enemy that are are that said we're going to wipe them all out right so we see this amen we know that so can you imagine and and this hey this doesn't even talk about what's going on with Russia and China and you know the Russia trying to you know threaten America and the different things that are going on so you know just imagine the the powers of God that have been employed God is fighting for Israel I don't know how long America will fight for isra but God is fighting for Israel amen God is preserving Israel I guess you've heard it you know the reports brother Ron B even told it but you know what if he did amen how that out of the 181 missiles that were fired toward Jerusalem that there was one death and it was a Palestinian Muslim Hallelujah all of their missiles and I don't believe it was just amen United States amen firing interceptors that stopped that I believe it was the powers of God Amen that were amen those missiles it might have been headed right for a populated area it might have been headed for a hospital amen but I believe there was an angel of the Lord amen that guided that missile they were guided missiles they just weren't Guided by the ones they wanted the the way they wanted to be guided but I believe there was guided missiles but the hand of almighty God that took those missiles amen and put them somewhere else amen the ones that weren't intercepted amen so you can see him and there's things that are going on that that that the depiction here of of the interruption of the temple construction and Daniel praying and and so forth how that that is is correct we know Ezra the 9th chapter familiar scripture to us the fourth verse says and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midst thereof amen don't you forget about Israel amen you know we get caught up in our own problems but don't you forget about brother B said that was God's time piece over there you want to see what's going on you want know what time it is you watch is or you see is or right so I see that that you know I see that scenario but you know the scenario I guess that I'd always envisioned when I read this about the angel trying to get to Daniel uh I'd always envisioned hey is your name Daniel your name your mom and dad misnamed you didn't they come on you can be Daniel this morning so you know I man come come on Daniel come over here you got a better seat you got the best seat in the house sit down right here so Daniel what is your name Daniel okay listen forgive them for messing up all right my mom called me Lindsay I've had to live with that for 60 years she messed up you can get over it makes you stronger so so here's Daniel and uh here's de he's been seeking the Lord and his his words are heard and the angel is trying to trying to get to trying to get to him and you know I've always envisioned that angel trying to come to uh to get to Daniel and here's the here's the powers of Darkness that are opposing him won't let him get there now I don't know maybe that's not the way you've depicted this in your in your mind this but that's kind of way brother Austin good to see you brother that I've I've depicted this that here the Devil he's there he's over there and this Angel's trying to get to him and the devil's opposing him thank you you didn't know he's an angel y'all he's an angel and so you know trying to get the Daniel to help Daniel you know that that's that's kind of the way that I've seen that you know that here is he's it's way off over here the Angels trying to get there and uh you know I uh you know the story how that brother brandom he had prayed for two neighbor women one of them had stomach issues and could not eat the other one had a big water or growth on her neck and brother B prayed for him in the same meeting and he he says this he says this in the the message healing what is cancer or what cancer is rather he said I told you many times the testimony of the people of how sometimes the angel Lord will pronounce that in in a case I don't know whether I was telling it the other day or not a woman had a stomach Pro trouble another woman with a growth on her neck and the spirit of the Lord told told them that they were healed told her to go home and eat while the woman couldn't eat she had tried 6 weeks nearly and she just made it got so sick and she could she kept trying and said one morning uh while at breakfast the dishes was being washed she felt a cool something sweep over her now he don't tell it in this article but he he says that you know she's getting so hungry and so weak and she said I guess the kid somebody left a piece of toast on a plate and and said she just looked down that piece of toast and she picked up that piece of toast thought maybe I can eat this and so she eat that piece of toast and and and nothing happened it didn't bother and then I think I think he tells there that that maybe she got her a bowl of Oats amen and began to eat the oats and and and it didn't bother her and then she thought my you know I'm going to drink a cup of coffee and she got a cup of coffee and drunk that cup of coffee amen but here he says he says she she found out that she could eat today something cooled swep over and she found out she could eat she ran to her neighbor to tell her about about it and she found her neighbor just screaming and shouting the growth that was on her neck had left what was it the angel of the Lord six weeks later six weeks later passed through that neighborhood confirming the word of God with signs following he has to do it how many knows that Daniel Prayed one time and the angel couldn't even get to him for 21 days amen so we see amen that that that yes you know you pray and the if you don't get in the meeting ask you know what the devil wants he wants you to disbelieve the word of God he wants you to believe that it didn't happen he wants you to believe that you're not going to be healed or your prayer is not going to be answered hold on hold on Amen because I tell you help is on the way amen for six weeks she tried these she couldn't amen amen you know what everybody's supp to say I heard you went up to that heiller I heard you had you had whatever and you heard you said just healed amen yes 6 weeks later you know it's just like that John Ryan to come blind John Ryan comeing across a platform Amen brother Ram said you're healed you know and he walks off and he's just it's just as dark as it's ever been Daniel you okay down there you okay all right good hey I got a water here do you need a water you need a water okay I might need it there's a couple more up here you just let me know if you need something we might get you bagel and uh you know John Ryden went off there he man I can't see you know I'm just just as dark and blind as I have ever been and so he he's dirty he thought man brother B must have made a mistake so he goes back around gets back in line comes back up again you know brother Brown I think took his hand whatever it was hey he's already healed there's no vibration there's nothing there he's healed you're healed you know you got to go Proclaim that thing you know the story better than I know amen he went off amen and he he got that revelation of healing amen so he goes off and he starts proclaiming uh brother James his his uh healing amen and he's telling everybody handing out newspapers whatever selling newspapers that he's healed he goes down to the barber shop and you know the barber start to make a little bit of fun of we sat down there says I hear you've been down there that healer and and and and you're telling every about you're healed he said that's right said I'm Healed and about that time guess what happen it didn't happen when he walked across that platform am man it didn't happen maybe when he thought it ought to happen but I'm going to tell you something he believed in anyway he believed the word of a prophet and said yeah you are healed amen and guess what as some point in time th healing was manifested and it's what you've got to do it's what we've got to do amen it says I think it's Hebrews the third chapter the first verse that he is the high priest of our profession amen that you make that profession you Proclaim it and he is high priest he begins to operate he begins to work to bring your profession to pass praise the Lord amen you know when Jesus he he he went into the Wilderness and was tempted of the devil the Bible says that he fasted for days and the devil came to him with the three Temptations you know you're hungry here turn these stones to bread you know cast yourself off the temple here worship me here's all the the the kings of the world I'll give them to you and Jesus rebuked the devil it is written we know that amen and that word steal will defeat the Devil any place anytime anywhere right amen and so he he rebuked the devil then after he rebuked the devil the Bible ible says then then the Angels Came and ministered unto him you know when the devil left him behold the Angels Came it's Matthew the 4th chapter 11 verse and minister to him so sometimes you know yeah you go through the battle this because you're in a battle don't mean you're defeated that's right Heen just because you don't feel anything don't mean you're defeated now see that's what Satan wants you to think amen well you prayed nothing happened you know you prayed far nothing happened what that's what the enemy wants to convince you of but you got to hold on Amen there's comes a point in time you got to outweight the devil did you hear me there's a time that you got to outweight the devil amen because now the devil's going to wait he's going to hang by your side but if you just keep holding on sooner or later that Devil's going to be defeated am but you can't give up you got to have some perseverance some persistence as a prophet of God talked about him and you got to outweight that devil you got to hold on Amen cuz soon later he's going to be defeated and you're going to see receive the victory you cannot give up amen don't you give up a so you know that's I see that I've left Daniel up here amen for the purpose because you know that's the way that I envisioned that at off at a distance here's the angel trying to get the Daniel and and the devil the Prince of Persia was trying to oppose him but then the third scenario that the Lord just kind of dealt with my heart on was that that here's the angel come on back up here angel you're work wasn't done you ain't never got here yet and come on up here yes on the platform yeah yeah come on up here Don't Preach here's Daniel seeking here's the angel right here to minister to him but between those is the devil and the devil's standing here saying wait a minute you know what your prayers don't mean anything you you prayed that don't mean anything they didn't hear your prayers you didn't hear you know that scenario is probably the scenario in the ancient Lord right here and yet we're we're we're here like oh Lord we do this and the devil's right there Whispering Your Ears well you're not going to be healed you're not going to be delivered your children will not be saved and and the the L Angel Lord thank you thank you you can be seated you know that and that scenario where the the devil is in our ears so that the angel Lord can't get to us amen because the enemy is telling us all these things that that he wants us to hear he's bomb farting in my mind he's he's battle the greatest battle ever fought was in the mind right and so the enemy trying to feel your mind you know how it is you've heard him mayen whenever you was praying for something a desperate need you didn't feel anything you didn't hear anything you know the pre the the minister the pastor whoever didn't even mention what you've been praying about and and the devil's sitting there whispering in years it's not going to happen it's not going to happen you might as well give up your might as well quit he he's done it for somebody else but he's not going to do it for you that devil in your ear battling your mind so that you cannot receive the word of God you cannot receive the thought from God you cannot receive the visitation from almighty God we got to recognize that that's a power of Darkness amen that is trying to block the the things of God from getting to you that's right listen brother bam s a message of trial he said your healing might be five minutes away way your unbelief will keep it away from as long as you live that's right now think about that here it is amen it's right there but if the devil can get you and convince you of unbelief that he takes it away from you forever I mean how close is it it's right there some of you been holding on to God Amen don't you quit holding on he's right there praise God you've been praying maybe for years amen don't you give up and quit listening to the devil quit letting the devil persuade you that it is not going to happen that it is not good enough that it's it's too far down the road or whatever you've not you know oh well you know youve really not prayed enough you haven't fasted enough you need to give more money if you give more money amen we'll get your we'll get your loved one out of purgatory we're not Catholics come on come on we're not we don't pay the price he paid the price hallelujah thank God I don't have to pay the price he paid it Hallelujah hey you know what he did he don't only pay it brother Ron but he stood there and he said in is finished in other words you don't have to add to it and you can't take away from it all we got to do is believe it amen don't you listen to the devil tell you well it ain't going to happen listen brother Bram said in that greatest battle that ever fought the Battle here you know we know in mind he said Satan and his demons anoints Humanity to disbelieve God's word so that's what he's doing you're holding on to God you're crying out to God God's got an answer for you he's got a Deliverance for you he's got a help for you and yet the devil's whispered in your ear all the things trying to bring an anointing on you to disbelieve the word of God to disbelieve what God Said what God had promised I mean so we see amen these scenarios now you know when the enemy begins to battle our mind and just because I'm taking my coat off doesn't mean I'm going to preach that much longer I'm almost done but I'm just hot okay and I don't never normally preach the jacket on anyway but uh you know I anyway forget it so we let's go back here just a little bit to the building of the temple can we do that just for a second you remember this opposition there from Ezra the 4th chapter that comes these adversaries that were opposing the construction of the temple and they had come against zerubabel and they come against Joshua the high priest and they got so discouraged that they stopped the work they built they laid the foundation but if you read in the scripture you'll find out that they they stopped they stopped work and it was the whole time that King Cyrus was was King and and I I I think he was King for approximately 40 years there about you can go back and look it up amen and for that that period of time here they had they had stopped the the construction of the temple they got that discouraged they went on with their lives they went on building their homes building their lives you know and and left the temple set there or the foundation of the temple set there and God got to the point that he took a little Prophet by the name of Hai and sent down to zerubba and said you know what y'all are living up here in your ceel houses but my house where's my house at amen go read there's just two chapters go read it amen so you know here God God get the point he's fed up with hey you know you you've turned your attention toward everything everything else you know but they were that they were that low they got that discouraged because of the opposition and that's what Satan wants to do right he wants you to get so discouraged amen that that you just stop the work of God you just stop stop amen trying to do something and listen if if Satan was was that opposed to the building of a natural building for the temple of God what about the the spiritual Temple because that Temple that it finally got built right they built that Temple it was remodeled by Herod and so forth but yet General Titus come along and destroyed it but God had already moved out of that building amen he when he moved out he split the temple veil from the top to the bottom he moved out amen he moved into a different Temple he moved into a different dwelling place right he chose some other place to dwell know you not that you are the temple of God and that the the the the spirit of God dwells within you right amen so we're that Temple so if Satan was opposed to the construction of the natural Temple what about the the supernatural Temple what about the spiritual Temple amen he wants to discourage you amen you know what you just sit back don't you worry amen you you know you can just you sit there and and some preacher will come along and he'll wave his hanky over you and he might spit and slobber over you and you got the Holy Ghost and and and you're the temple of God oh yeah they'll that's what they'll do for you right that's what Satan will tell you right amen don't you don't you try to don't you seek God to become the temple of God Amen so Satan is is opposed to it and every every group that has ever Arisen amen that if they started off with any kind of indwelling of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Satan substituted that for something else because he's opposed to that he don't care how religious you are he don't care how many quotes you can quote and how much scripture you can quote amen because there's only one thing that makes that scripture real there's only one thing that makes those quotes real and that's the spirit of God anointing those amen so that makes it real so if he can get you a vessel yeah your mind may be full of the word your mind may be full of the quotes amen but as long as there's nothing there to make it real amen you're not a challenge to him he's not worried about you but all of a sudden when the H the power of God comes down and it begins to anoint the word that is in your heart amen it begins to anoint the quotes that are in your heart and it begins to make them real amen that fears Satan because he knows he has no nothing he has nothing Amen to do against that has nothing to oppose that amen he cannot argue with the Living Word remember Jesus those Temptations Satan it is written he didn't argue that's right he didn't say well let now wait a minute I I got a quote over here I got another scripture no he didn't argue he moved on to the next Temptation and that's what it is when you're when the word amen by the spirit of God begins to live in you amen Satan has no argu argument to that that word defeats him right and you say well wait a minute you I can say the word so could the sons of ska oh listen you know we adure thee by Jesus whom Paul preaches come out oh Jesus we know and Paul we know but who are you so they tried to quote the word right they were quoters there's a lot of quoters but we need to be more than quarters right we need something that is greater than just amen we need a living we need the word to come alive in us and it only does that but a spirit of God because it's all you know hey this is not the sword of Lindsay McGrady this is not the sword of Ron Peterson this is not the sword of brother Mario this is the sword of the Lord amen amen he it was a king sword that's right not a king sword but the king sword right amen it was the word of God so it's it takes the spirit of God in us to op at that word in our lives there's a lot of people that try to they can't do it I don't know why I'm saying these things again this this message what even know I wouldn't think thinking about this till an hour ago or whatever amen so we see that now you so zerubabel and and Joshua the God so that resistance Satan standing there to resist them they got so discouraged they quit amen until God send them heya the prophet Amen to to rebuke them and then they made that commitment we're going to build this Temple and they started but the word also came to Zechariah the prophet the fourth chapter and the sixth verse it said did he answer to sping to me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts amen so we got to realize it and by our ability God I can't do this on my own I can't do this in my own strength oh lord it's not my wisdom a lot of people tried to do it in their understanding and their wisdom and you know what sooner or later they fail but I'm going to tell you something there's one that will not fail it's not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts and it's a same today it's the same today Hallelujah we still need it praise God Amen I'm going to hurry get around here do I enclose this thing I don't even know when I started amen James the 4th chapter the 7th verse says submit yourself therefore to God resist the devil amen sister Sandy resist that devil Amen in the name of sister Sandy in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the name amen and he will flee from you hallelujah amen that Devil's going to flee amen but you know what if he convict you no you're defeated you flee from him that's right but there's a time you got to hold on you got to help is coming amen hold on Amen 2 Corinthians the fourth the 10th chapter the fourth verse for the weapons of our Warfare they are not they're not carnal too often we try to approach everything from a carnal standpoint we try to work things out carnally I understand that you know I I'm analytical just by Nature you know I try to analyze everything and figure everything out from analytical standpoint why is this working or whatever amen but it it that's that's not the weapon that's going to defeat Satan amen it's not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord for the weapons of our Warfare they are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds oh Satan's tried to fortify himself someplace in your life every time you start getting spiritual every time God you start trying to do something for God he goes back maybe he goes back to the recesses of your memory and he begins to remind you of a failure in your past he begins to tell you of things that happened and were done and guess what now instead of you feeling like you can go out and do something for God Amen that you can accomplish something for him now amen all of a sudden you're carrying back in the quarter said oh yeah I failed so bad it was so bad it was terrible you know I I remember that that's a stronghold of Satan if he's always going to that to subdue you it's a stronghold but thank God we've got a weapon we got a weapon Hallelujah that is capable of pulling down every stronghold Hallelujah and he goes on there Amen in the fifth verse say casting down imaginations because that's where Satan amen gets into your mind and telling you amen of your defeat and of your your failures and of all the things that get the Bible says cast down it don't you entertain it don't you allow Satan to control your thoughts amen because if he does he's going to control you that's right if he can control your thoughts he'll control you amen so uh you casting down imaginations in every High thing that exalted s against the knowledge of God if it's against the word of God and it's trying to uh be contrary to the word of God he's trying to tell you things that are not correct according to the word amen you know what that is something is exalting itself above uh above uh the knowledge of God Amen and bring into captivity every thought into The Obedience of Christ help Lord so if Satan can get there and win that a mean he's defeated you amen he's the one here you are down here praying like my buddy Daniel miles Daniel was it miles was it right was it miles okay Daniel Daniel is your middle name Daniel you can have it change you get old enough you can change it okay I don't think I'm supposed to be recommending people the kids to get their name changed anyway so was you named after one of your parents any don't tell me I that's that's but you know you're down here you're seeking God and the devil's there amen trying to feel your mind full of all these things amen and and we got to if we want to if we want to receive what God is trying to send we got to we got to take all that and cast it aside we got to unclutter that right amen you know that's why it's wonderful sometimes just come to the house of God you know uh uh 30 minutes as the prophet of God told us to before and I cannot get people to do that and they don't I like why don't you come am mean you you've been working working working amen you got all these things going on coming here cast aside the imaginations or and all these things Amen to clear your mind so the word of God can get through to you because that devil is there amen trying to that Prince of Persia is there trying to oppose you you know maybe yours is not the Prince of Persia maybe it's the the prince on the job the boss on the job you know maybe we had marriage counseling already the other night you know maybe it's the wife you know who you know you got to come sometimes and declutter amen the fault process so that the word that God has sense trying to get to you because God knows where you're at than he knows what you are going through and he's trying to get a word to you but that devil said well it's not for you it's for somebody else or he's trying to remind you the things that need to be done amen see how he works amen Hebrews the 10th chapter the 35th verse says cast not away therefore your confidence which have great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tar and you have you know yeah you you've done what God told you to do you stood upon the word of the Lord now just wait don't you give up amen hold on that's right hold on the word amen I believe the answer is on the way amen there's a song like that somewhere along the answer's on the way amen just because the answer doesn't come immediately or or quickly as we'd like for it doesn't mean that it's not on the way that's right don't mean that that that things aren't already happening how often oh there situations I me so you know we going back there to Daniel the 10th chapter and the 12th verse and the angel speaking here D say then said he enemy feared not Daniel for from the first day that thou did set thine heart to understand and chasen thyself before thy God thy words were heard from the first day the first time you kept praying you kept praying that's what you're supposed to be just likeing maybe that little that little Widow coming for the unjust judge you know she just kept coming and kept coming and kept coming amen and and here's Daniel Prayed and prayed but the first day the word Was Heard thank you Lord you know every once in a while we might be driving down the road or me and Sharon talking she's or she's talking and I'm listening but she made sure I'm listening and she's talking she's telling me something and she says are you listening I said yeah I'm listening yeah I had to repeat I heard you the first time I I got a I got a precious sister in the flesh not in the spirit and flesh that you know when when I I dread talking to her on the phone I love her but I dread talk because she's going to tell me everything three times I guess she thinks I don't listen but everything she tells me she she repeats it three times and I want to say the first day you started talking I heard you the first time you know tell me I this this 45 minute conversation you could have been 10 minutes long if you hadn't repeated yourself three times right hey if you don't believe me ask my wife I me she knows it's a truth and so I se the phone Shar it's for you it's my sister it's for you amen so but he said you know the first time when you s when you when you put it in your heart when you got it in in your [Applause] heart to to to approach the throne that very first day you were hurt you get something in your heart amen you know a lot of times I think you know we we go through the exercise of prayer amen and we you know we got all the needs and all the situations and all the problems and we go through it and so forth but sometimes when there's something on your heart it's on your heart amen you you get on your your knees and you begin to cry out to Goden the devil starts he starts immediately it ain't going to happen it's too big you know God this that the other you know and and yet we know that on your heart said the first time it come on your heart Daniel from that very first day amen thy words were heard but he says he goes on Beyond thy words were heard but listen to Jus said and I am come for thy words I am come your words that you began to cry out on that first day it moved God and I am come because of your words now I'm going to tell you something maybe your name ain't Daniel maybe there's just a handful of Daniels in here and I could have probably picked one amen but he just looked too cute to leave him sitting there and so and and but I'm going to tell you something when you begin to pray things begin to happen thank you Lord God begins to move maybe you don't feel anything but something begins to happen God begins to work on the scene he begins to move amen the powers in heaven began to move praise God and so I'm going to tell you something I can believe that all three of these scenarios that I put before you are actually true and real that yes there are things that are happening in the natural that the spirit is moving behind the scene and there's war going on spiritually and and naturally and Israel so and the powers of God are are are working there I can see that I can believe that amen and I can believe also that you know the enemy is trying to oppose uh uh uh the presence of of that angel from getting to you but I can also we know for a fact amen that here we are crying out to God and the devil is battling our mind amen telling us it's not going to happen amen so I I see all three of these amen but listen amen don't give up because it's never too late again the devil will tell you it's too late you know put yourself in the in the in the shoes of Mary and Martha their brother is sick and he's dying and so you know they they send a message to Jesus we we've seen the supernatural power we know that it's real we know what he can do and here the one that he loves is is is sick unto death and send a message to him and the message gets to Jesus and and Jesus terries he waits and all the time while Jesus waiting here's here's Mary and Martha have you heard anything yet is Jesus coming you know he's where is he at I mean where's he coming has anybody said anything if you heard a messenger you know just keep watching just keep watching he's coming and here's Lazarus getting weaker and weaker and sicker and sicker and sicker and and until finally he said what's going on and the next thing you know there's no pulse there's no breath there's nothing and he's gone and they like man I thought for sure Jesus would show up surely he wouldn't forget about how to see you know he's atting our home and and we've done all these how can he forget about us now and this need and and and so they're thinking as well you know we got to get him buried we got us by our our customs we've got to get him buried and and and get everything ready you know get everybody over here get you know all this is going on all this activity and finally Jesus is out there hey we need to go you know I know what's going on we need to go well Lazarus he's sleep well if he's sleeping he's doing good he finds no he he's gone and so they go and and Jesus goes and uh here's they're waiting on him and he's he's like where's he at and finally Lazarus is in the Tomb and they look out the window and here comes Jesus and I don't remember which one one I'm runs out to meet him get to go to John 11th chapter read it John 11th chapter and runs out to meet him and and uh and Lord if you had been here our our brother hadn't died yeah and see that's the way a lot of people want to do that this is the way it used to be and this is It's a god of the past that if if if you'd been here I know if brother brand was still on the scene or so and so or whatever you know we put in the past if if if you know this wouldn't have happened and Jesus said you know what I I I'm the Resurrection Life he I know Lord that a at the resurrection we go we're going to see him again and so they go she goes from the past immediately to being a futuristic God out here in the future I know in the future when you come you know I'm going to be healed of this sickness when you come and we're we're raptured out of here you know my problem is going to be solved so you know immediately they take it out there to the to the Future and that's what a lot of people are you know they had a god of the past and a God that's out here in the future but what about an Ever presentent God what about a God Amen that is present in the middle of your storm in the middle of your battle amen a very present help amen what about that God see that's what she's doing H in the past if you have been here out the future the resurrection but Jesus had say I am the resurrection and life and he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live amen and then Jesus said hey to show me where you laid him let's go over to the tomb amen and over to the tomb and all the Weeping and Welling it's going on and Jesus says roll back the stor oh Lord Lord he's been dead four days now and you know that man there it's he's going to stink and it's going to be awful and we can't dishonor The Dead We you know all this and and so forth and you know Jesus tells her there in the 40th verse of chapter 11 he said she said unto her said I not unto thee if thou wouldest believe thou should us see the glory of God sometimes you think it's too late sometimes you think it's hopeless but with Jesus Christ it's never too late it's never hopeless amen because all he has to do is amen roll walk up to your dead expectations roll up to the walk up to your dead hopes woke up to your dead faith of yester year oh I remember when we used to shout I remember amen when the presence of God used to come and Jesus wants to walk up to that stone barrier and say roll back the stone Lazarus come forth amen and I'm going to tell you something if he hadn't used the name Lazareth that'd all come out of there amen but he walks up to your dead dreams your dead hopes your dead Faith your dead Joy your dead emotion amen and he cist Out roll back that stone roll back that stone amen I want something to

I'm going to close and said in fact if musicians will come back Hebrews the 10th chapter the 23rd verse amen said let us hold fast the profession of our faith without now we know some of us have guilty of wavering yeah some of us we've been guilty of wavering you know man and hey I I'm there I've been there I've done it I've done it amen man sometimes like I say the devil pants paints pants paints what do y'all say out here paints paints such a bleak picture that everything looks hopeless it looks dark amen and you just get there and just like everything is wrong and and so forth and you get did and he he he creates that atmosphere he creates that mindset and then you're you're there in that but if you could ever realize hey I don't I this is not this is not God this is not what God has ordained amen I I'm serving a true and a living God you can immediately break that barrier amen the the the darkness goes away hold fast your profession of Faith amen the profession of our faith without waving for he is faithful yes that promised thank you Lord there may be a lot of things fail there will be people fail they'll people walk away from the message say it's no longer true amen

oh yeah I don't have much confidence in the media now let alone 100 years ago that's right right so hey that don't change a thing that don't bother me you know but that's what the devil will try to
