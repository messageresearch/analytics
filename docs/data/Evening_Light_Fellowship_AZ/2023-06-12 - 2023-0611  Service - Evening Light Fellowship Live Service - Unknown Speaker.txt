waiting for us for the Overcomers it's good to see us here when you're visiting your brothers after a time and we see him again that's what we want to know that's very good you don't need to talk too much just to see him again it shows a message it hasn't been easy it hasn't been easy to see us again but when you see a brother again the Grace has been sustained them amen that's why we're here this morning there's some friends here I don't know if I presented my son Thomas that's my son Thomas [Applause] we're gonna go to the word my brother Pierre here said it don't go too fast like like a child Spanish I'm already with my parachute and they're ready to go out the door we're gonna just go off First Corinthians 13. in verse 13. the three greatest gifts that God has given us my glasses I'm sorry for that in verse 13. it says [Music] Hope Charity these three but the greatest of these is charity in Spanish it says it stays in English in English it says it stays longer than the Spanish translation it says it stays the faith hope and charity Lord Heavenly Father we're grateful to be here once more to be here this morning we thank you Lord because your Grace has allowed it hasn't been easy there's many animals they wanted to stop us and you're here to bless us you guys can have your seat foreign [Music] [Music] or love and like he was going to do something great he needed these three Witnesses faith hope and charity [Music] in the year 60. he also preaches under this title he says in these three the faith hope and charity they're the three greatest gifts that God can give to us faith hope and charity amen when he's going to do something great and God's going to do something great with us he's going to do something great and he needs that that bride have those three express myself today it's easy to understand faith they don't allow us the five senses don't allow us to communicate with our internal and it's only the Sixth Sense to communicate with God to come in contact with the spirit that is a sixth sense you need to exercise so they can be in good conditions like the musicians they have a very good sense [Music] they use the the sense of ice they go through there through the woods the same thing that you can see because the sense and as we get older vamos uh but if you don't exercise amen [Music] it's not going to be any good I mean I have a problem with this arm muchacho when I was a younger and I couldn't really do exercise and over here strong arm and this I know it was the same arms but one was exercise that is a sense of faith is where I can stay the scripture that says look at ourselves if you're in the faith it's good to be in church it's good to be part of a Ministry but it's much better to be in the faith amen foreign the Faith of Our Fathers exercise and what can we say I like this of Jesus Christ says something like this this is says take a look this is going to be shown in the last days of the church do you understand it comes like a seal to their church but it know that there's a seal foreign [Music] I want to say amen foreign [Music] there's going to be a problem foreign [Music] so I don't want that uh my wife we are the love of Christ it it is there's a scripture in Jeremiah 31. this is with love Eternal I have loved you if we are the love of God you're Eternal just like God amen amen glory to God for that if we are his love there's eternity just because I'm happy this morning to be part of the the brothers in sane it says like there's a scripture or the message this is why the Christians is born again it doesn't have an end because he has eternal life and eternal life is part of the same life of God and the same God in Greek Zoe a man being born again his spirit is changed he becomes a part of God just like God himself glory to God amen amen when someone knows that is impossible it's impossible to not have hope remember the three gifts the faith is a sense we are an expression of the love of God says many times we fail in hope we start to lose hope and that's what I want to talk to you today Colossians you know 126. what it says here Apostle Paul says here we connect a little bit here to talk about hope so we can live here without renewing of Hope Tennessee is 126. this is foreign which hath been hid from the ages and from the generations but now it's made manifest to the Saints again to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of his this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory starts to talk to us about the mystery of Christ since the beginning this is the beginning in the creation [Music] through the blood and it was Jesus foreign it was Christ this morning the hope of glory amen glorious we are happy it's a it's a sense very necessary they can preserve life [Music] to find life there's loss of life foreign foreign looking for a reason uh I like indications is the truth and I'm here this morning and I'm here to say amen I am the proof that this message is true [Music] the Believers in the message in the time of Jesus they got disappointed and the best time they got disappointed in front of the calvary and it was the best time this is when the lamb was going to pay the price it was the best time when God was taken in prison the message and they got disappointed patience Peter got so depressed and he did it with words bad words he lost hope they should have been there waiting for him is that right they were fighting why were they hiding they lost hope you lose hope you get disappointed and from disappointment goes to depression and now you don't want to come to church he was so depressed that he didn't go to church himself Jesus showed himself see it nobody showing us out there in that service because he completed his work he didn't care about the attitudes of the disciples to finish his work and when his disciples were disappointed and he said come was Thomas when they told him he said no no I don't see it that's why it's good to come to church but our lord Jesus in the next week he comes to service again he always comes to church all the disciples were there this time and Jesus shows himself and he says he said something last time hahaha pencil and Thomas oh they already they spilled the beans still that's not correct so you want to get out of here amen so when we see these things happening in San Francisco California I was in San Francisco California last week and it is very bad there no no lion don't go but that is not going to disappoint me in San Francisco California I didn't expect to see uh Saints there no no huh foreign Cinco in Espanola menu It's a Great Expression here it was me but to take his my sins upon him to be like him ah what's up go with him definitely that gives us hope I can see him from myself in in a word and I can see that and I failed you see my errors and that's fine so we can take away the Comfort right the expression of brother Branham I think it was a sister that said I'm not what I use what I am also not where I used to be it sounds beautiful it's like an excuse how many years does the message how many times how many years as Believers I think it's time that we have to do excuse time the bride of Christ be what it has to be amen that's why God sends us his holy ghosts and we can fail to say excuses amen is God can make you be here today in conclusive he's not going to leave work undone foreign amen is going to be concluded completely I'm here today this morning my position in Christ amen foreign take this this body you can take this you guys understand each other that he can take that is to be like him amen that's why the devil hates us but listen to this he always wanted to be like him he was so spectacular the Throne of God amen that's why this is a promise so big he transforms himself and our enemy because he can accept that he was the greatest in the creation it was a party when he was there foreign a situation that happened in Chile and I want to tell you because it's related to this foreign ERS that were buried in the mind it fell apart the mine so I'm going to tell you it has elements to understand this better there's about 700 meters down but he was lost just like them all of them down there he couldn't do nothing it was a specialist in rescue but if he was up there he would be very useful but he was down there just like everyone else laughs okay so what does this man do come on he's starting to remember something of his instructions I have to maintain alive the hope these people down here these miners we're all gonna die and this man said I'm gonna do everything possible they started to look down there crawling around in the darkness that the miners use [Music] he found a sign we're going to go to that place of Refuge and that guy he got really excited in the midst of the loss there was a place of Refuge amen don't you feel great that you have a place of Refuge yes it's Christ and good is Christ and these miners they went to that place it was a place that was protected I had a couple reserves there of food but he was a specialist he couldn't rescue them but what he did know he had to maintain hope ministers that and surely and some were left with Hunger even though what they received there was going to help them to live one more day of it is a perfect type of the faithful Ministry the faithful Ministry the pastor the ministers they're not going to take you out of here but they can't give you the necessary you can live one more day while we wait for Rescue and that's what this man did and when someone started to get crazy and something started to lose hope say what's happening they're coming for us they're going to get us out of here but he had faith sometimes and some shakers then they will regroup their hope and then the peace would come and another day they came from above because some people in the message believe they're Professionals in rescue there's some uh eliminated and they want to rescue us from down here the rescue comes from above what happened what happened in Chile the government it made a promise we're not going to rest in this is going to invest in it Gloria and I give glory to God that the children have got to be lost here we're going to make a plan to find you get you out of there that's the same way they got the best equipment the best technology from all over the world the best foreign there were some diseases happening there was one man I can keep him with hope glorious for a great ministry that can maintain their hope and one time they felt a vibration a noise and there's a probe that pops through it was a camera in the camera in the middle they understood they were looking for them and they had found them they were still down there foreign [Applause] it was called the messenger glorious he had a message we're looking for you you're walking the walk and talk to you about a message
