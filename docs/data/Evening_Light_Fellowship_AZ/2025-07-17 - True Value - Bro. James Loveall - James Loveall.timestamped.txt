[2:16] special way. And sister Nancy also has a

[2:21] pray for our daughter Sarah and her
[2:22] husband that they would find a house."
[2:25] So the Lord knows that need, pray the
[2:26] Lord just be with them. And if you have
[2:27] a need tonight, you just want to lift it
[2:30] before the Lord with Stephen if you
[2:31] would come.
[2:33] [Music]
[2:36] Let's all pray together. Father God, we
[2:39] have come here this evening for a
[2:41] purpose, Lord, because we have a desire
[2:43] in our hearts to learn more of you,
[2:45] Father. And we know that where there's a
[2:47] deep, there's a deep to respond. And so
[2:49] we're here, Lord, and we're asking,
[2:51] Father, that you would come and fulfill
[2:53] the desires of our heart, Father God.
[2:55] And that main desire is more of you,
[2:57] Lord. Father, touch the needy in heart.
[3:00] Touch the needy in mind, Father, in
[3:02] body. For we know that you are an ontime
[3:05] God. And that by your stripes, Lord, we
[3:07] are healed. We ask that you would come
[3:09] this evening, Father, by the foolishness
[3:11] of preaching, Lord, that you would
[3:14] change our lives, Father, like we so
[3:16] often say, Lord, may we leave this
[3:19] building different than what we came in,
[3:21] Lord. Father God, if there's anything
[3:24] within us that's evil or contrary,
[3:27] unlike you, Father, Lord, we ask that
[3:29] you would take it from us, Father, for
[3:31] we want to be like you, Lord. Bless
[3:33] brother James this evening. May you
[3:35] anoint him, inspire him of your spirit.
[3:38] Father God, relax his spirit, Lord, that
[3:41] he may yield the gift of God unto thee,
[3:44] Lord. We commit all things into thy
[3:46] hands. We thank you for the opportunity
[3:48] that you've given us again to be here.
[3:50] We love you. We thank you in Jesus
[3:52] Christ's name. Amen.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Stephen. Amen. You
[3:57] may be seated tonight. It's good to be
[3:58] in the house of the Lord. We want to
[4:00] welcome each one. If you're here
[4:01] visiting tonight or you're streaming the
[4:04] service, we just want to welcome you.
[4:05] It's good to be set free.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; I was thinking of that song today. Thank
[4:09] God I am free. Free. Free.
[4:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; For a long time I traveled
[4:20] down a long lonely road.

[4:33] and I heard about Jesus.

[5:39] Like a poor wretched maker
[5:43] who's found fortune and fame.
[5:47] I'm so glad that I found out he could
[5:50] bring me out through his holy name.

[7:13] Brother Ron just handed me a note to
[7:16] special unspoken prayer request for
[7:18] brother Bisco. So let's just go to the
[7:19] Lord in prayer. The Lord is with this

[7:32] Father, a testimony. And
[7:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, in these older years of his life,
[7:36] Father, he has a special need, Father.
[7:38] And we pray that you would just come on
[7:40] the scene, Lord, and
[7:41] &gt;&gt; meet that need in a special way. And
[7:43] &gt;&gt; be merciful, be gracious, Lord, we pray.
[7:45] And we just look forward to hearing of a
[7:48] good report. Father,
[7:49] &gt;&gt; we just lift him now before you and ask
[7:51] you to touch him in Jesus name.

[17:45] [Music]
[17:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. And I'm I was a
[17:49] little late tonight and I didn't mention
[17:50] anything. I'm sorry. But I wanted to
[17:52] give this testimony because it's just so
[17:54] fresh from yesterday. And uh 3 weeks ago
[17:57] or so, the saints were asked to pray.
[17:59] They had diagnosed me with prostate
[18:01] cancer. And I had did a little homework.
[18:04] I just want to say first of all that
[18:05] Elizabeth had us go in for blood work
[18:07] here a while ago, which I'd have never
[18:08] done that. We've never been to the
[18:10] doctor for a physical exam. We just
[18:13] don't have unless we're I don't know,
[18:15] maybe if we're dead, we'd go see him,
[18:16] but it wouldn't seem dead either, would
[18:18] you? But anyhow, she wanted to have
[18:20] blood work done. And I realized that was
[18:21] really just God inspiring.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; Sorry. Yes, sir.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; Inspiring her because from that blood
[18:28] work then we find out I have a PSA
[18:30] elevated. I still know anything's wrong
[18:32] 100%. You know, I'd never know. But uh
[18:36] so they wanted to do the biopsy. So that
[18:38] was 3 weeks ago, but then I had done a
[18:39] little homework and you find that that's
[18:40] a very slow growing cancer and and
[18:42] sometimes you'll never live long enough
[18:44] for it to affect you. And so that was
[18:47] kind of what I was expecting here a few
[18:49] weeks ago when they did the biopsy, but
[18:51] then no, it came back as they they rate
[18:53] them on a Gleon scale of 1 to 10 and and
[18:56] 10 being the highest and this was number
[18:58] nine as far as aggressive. And so then
[19:00] the next thing was they're worried
[19:01] spread, you know. So they just uh
[19:04] yesterday then I got the results from
[19:05] that scan. They did a whole body scan to
[19:08] see if the cancer had spread and and it
[19:10] has not. So that was a very happy day
[19:13] for me.
[19:14] [Applause]
[19:20] So that was what we were praying there 3
[19:23] weeks ago that the cancer had not spread
[19:24] any further. And I believe God answered
[19:27] your prayers, the prayers of the saints.
[19:29] And I thank you for praying for me. God
[19:32] bless you richly. I love you each one.
[19:40] Praise the Lord. continue to hold
[19:43] brother Russell up in prayer and just
[19:45] believe for a total complete healing for
[19:47] the Russell. Amen.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; The potter's hands.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Beautiful Lord, wonderful Savior of my
[19:53] life placed in his hands tonight. Let
[19:56] him have his way. Amen.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; A beautiful Lord,
[20:01] wonderful Savior.
[20:05] I know for sure
[20:08] all of my days are held in your hands
[20:15] to
[20:17] your perfect.
[20:19] [Music]
[20:24] You gently call me into your presence.
[20:30] Guide me by
[20:34] your Holy Spirit.
[20:37] Teach me, Lord,
[20:40] to live all my life
[20:43] through
[20:45] your
[20:46] eyes.
[20:50] I'm grounded by
[20:52] your holy, holy,
[20:56] set me aart.
[20:58] I know you're crying
[21:02] me to yourself,
[21:04] [Music]
[21:06] Lord. I pray.
[21:14] So take me,
[21:18] hold me,
[21:21] use me,
[21:24] build me.
[21:27] I give my life
[21:30] to the father's
[21:33] hand.
[21:43] Guide me.
[21:45] [Music]
[21:48] Walk beside me.
[21:52] I give my life to you.
[21:58] Sing it again as brother James tonight

[22:45] to live all my life
[22:49] through
[22:50] your
[22:52] eyes.
[22:55] I have to fight.
[22:58] You're holy.
[23:02] Set me aart.
[23:04] I know you're
[23:08] me.
[23:10] [Applause]
[23:12] Lord
[23:13] I pray
[23:20] so
[23:23] and
[23:32] I
[23:36] [Music]
[23:41] Take me home
[23:45] to me
[23:48] and guide me.
[23:50] [Music]
[23:53] Walk beside me.
[23:57] I give my life
[24:00] to
[24:03] [Music]
[24:12] How many truly that's your prayer this
[24:14] evening?
[24:16] &gt;&gt; That you would say, "Father, come and
[24:18] take me and mold me." And
[24:22] &gt;&gt; Father, take out things in my life that
[24:24] are not like you. And
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, if you have to start all over,
[24:30] &gt;&gt; yes.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; As long as you're in the potter's hands,
[24:34] it's a good place to be. Yes, sir.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; That you can be molded into a image that
[24:41] he sees fit to use.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; That's why we've gathered here this
[24:46] evening.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; On a Wednesday night.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; To say, "Father, come and speak to our
[24:53] hearts.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; Minister unto me."
[24:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; Let me be in the center of your will.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, Lord.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; That as you begin to work me and
[25:04] &gt;&gt; you begin to mold me, I can be just like
[25:06] you.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; Maybe you have a need tonight.
[25:13] And you want to make it known unto the
[25:15] Lord with an uplifted hand.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; And say, "Father, I have a desire. I
[25:20] have a need in my life. And
[25:23] I need you to come on the scene.
[25:26] [Music]
[25:28] Father, we are a needy people this
[25:30] evening.
[25:32] [Music]
[25:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, we have needs. We have desires.
[25:36] [Music]
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Father, I have nothing to offer.
[25:42] [Music]
[25:44] &gt;&gt; But little is much when God is in it.
[25:47] Yes,
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Lord. If you could take the fishes and
[25:53] loaves and
[25:56] &gt;&gt; feed the thousands, how much more
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, in a day and an hour
[26:05] &gt;&gt; where the word has been revealed.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; When it's come into its fullness, oh
[26:11] God.
[26:13] And so we're asking,
[26:16] Lord, your people have needs. There's
[26:20] uplifted hands all over the building.
[26:23] [Music]
[26:24] &gt;&gt; Father, I don't know, but you do.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; And we're just asking by the foolishness
[26:29] of preaching that you would go and you
[26:31] would minister to hearts, that you would
[26:33] walk the aisles, that you would begin to
[26:35] discern spirits, and Lord, take out
[26:37] things that aren't like you, oh God.
[26:40] that you would mold us, oh God, and make
[26:42] us into the very image that you would
[26:43] see fit. Yeah. Father, I humble myself
[26:47] and I get myself out of the way, oh God.
[26:51] And Lord, I just ask that your people
[26:53] would pull upon the gift. And Lord, as
[26:55] the word would go forth, that it would
[26:57] fall into good ground, that we'd bring
[26:59] forth life.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask that you would have your
[27:05] way in this service. Come have your way
[27:09] &gt;&gt; in Jesus precious name.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; And amen.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this evening.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't he good to us?
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles,
[27:22] thank you musicians. Let's turn to
[27:24] Genesis 24.
[27:28] We're going to go to Matthew 6.
[27:33] Sounds like my time is already up.
[27:38] Not yet.
[27:40] The word hasn't been read.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; Genesis 24 and verse one,
[27:48] very familiar portion of scripture
[27:50] of Eleaser getting a bride for Isaac.
[27:57] And verse one says, Abraham was old and
[27:59] well stricken in age, and the Lord had
[28:01] blessed Abraham in all things.
[28:05] And Abraham said unto his eldest servant
[28:08] of the house that ruled over all that he
[28:12] had. I want us to take a moment right
[28:15] there. He had
[28:17] went and chose the oldest of servants.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; He didn't go and choose some young
[28:22] whippers snapper, the brand new servant,
[28:25] the servant that didn't know what to do,
[28:27] the one that hadn't been taught, but he
[28:29] went and chose a servant of maturity.
[28:32] Yes, sir.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; He went and chose a servant
[28:36] &gt;&gt; that he knew he could trust and he can
[28:38] depend.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; He chose a servant who knew the things
[28:42] that he liked and he didn't like.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; That's very good.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; Because let me tell you, if he chose a
[28:49] servant he couldn't trust, how could he
[28:51] give him all things?
[28:53] &gt;&gt; Why would he entrust something unto some
[28:55] man that he couldn't trust everything,
[28:58] all that he had?
[29:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:03] And Abraham said unto this elder servant
[29:06] of the house that ruled o over all that
[29:08] he had, put, I pray thee, thy hand under
[29:11] my thigh,
[29:13] and I will make thee swear by the Lord,
[29:15] the God of heaven, and the God of earth,
[29:18] that thou shalt not take a wife unto my
[29:20] son of the daughters of the Canaanites,
[29:22] among whom I dwell. But thou shalt go
[29:25] into a country, my country, and my
[29:27] kindred, and take a wife unto my son
[29:30] Isaac. And the servant said unto him,
[29:33] Pre-adventure the woman will not be
[29:35] willing to follow me unto this land.
[29:37] Must I need to bring thy son again unto
[29:40] the land from whence thy came? And
[29:42] Abraham said unto him, Beware thou, that
[29:45] thou shalt not bring my son thither
[29:48] &gt;&gt; again.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Don't bring my son thither. What is he
[29:53] asking him?
[29:55] There's no need for return ministry.
[29:56] There's no need that you go and have to
[29:58] come again.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; There's no need of that. But the Bible
[30:02] says here, the the servant asked
[30:04] pre-adventure that I don't find the
[30:07] woman. That's carnal understanding. That
[30:09] say the servant is asking, "What if I go
[30:11] out and I look and I can't find one that
[30:14] is willing to listen?
[30:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; What if I I go out and I search the land
[30:19] and I can't find one that's willing to
[30:22] follow me back?" Yeah.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; And he's saying,
[30:27] &gt;&gt; "Whatever you do, do not bring my son
[30:30] again unto that land."
[30:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Listen why in verse 7. And the Lord God
[30:40] of heaven, which took me from my
[30:42] father's house, and from the land of my
[30:44] kindred, and which spake unto me, and
[30:46] that's where unto me, saying, Unto thy
[30:49] seed will I give you this land, and he
[30:51] shall send his angel before thee, that
[30:54] shall take a wife unto my son. God is
[30:58] already making a provided way.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; He's already making a provided way
[31:02] before it's even done. Before he even
[31:05] sends his servant, he says, "Don't
[31:06] worry." That's why God down through all
[31:08] the ages and every generation, listen,
[31:11] he's there. There's no worry or fear of
[31:13] if God's going to have a people upon the
[31:15] earth.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; There's no worry.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he sent his angel before.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; To make his prophets of every single age
[31:26] down all through time. He sent an angel
[31:28] before him to make him prosperous. Amen.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; And if the woman will not be willing to
[31:36] follow thee, listen again. Thou shalt be
[31:40] clear from this my oath. Only bring not
[31:43] my son thither again. And the servant
[31:46] put his hand under the thigh of Abraham
[31:48] his master, and swear to him concerning
[31:52] that matter.
[31:54] And the servant took 10 camels of the
[31:57] camels of his master, and departed. for
[32:00] all the goods of his master
[32:03] &gt;&gt; were in his hand.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; You can be seated this evening.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Now I want to
[32:19] as I said in verse two and Abraham said
[32:21] to his eldest servant, it was just
[32:23] something that the Lord began to deal
[32:26] with my heart. And as I begin to look
[32:28] into this portion of scripture and I
[32:30] begin to try to just see the value
[32:34] of what lays here within the scripture
[32:39] because Abraham, as I said, didn't
[32:40] choose the youngest of servants. He
[32:44] didn't choose a man that was just uh wet
[32:48] behind the ears. He didn't know a whole
[32:49] lot.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he chose a servant who had
[32:54] been around a while,
[32:55] &gt;&gt; who had been under his teachings, who
[32:57] had been under him, and he's been able
[32:59] to tell him and show him all the ways of
[33:01] how he would like it.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he had to have such uh
[33:07] confidence in this man.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah. Because if this man
[33:11] was to go out
[33:13] and the Bible says he was weary in age
[33:16] and he knew that he was coming to a
[33:17] place and there was a junction in time
[33:20] that he didn't have many days left here
[33:22] on earth and he knew that his heritage
[33:25] and his lineage would then live on
[33:27] through Isaac.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; And so he knew the the value that laid
[33:32] here.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; He knew the value of the woman that
[33:36] Isaac must have.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Right? Why?
[33:41] Because the value laid within the seed
[33:45] &gt;&gt; of Isaac.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Because if you go and read the chapter
[33:50] before
[33:52] and Abraham goes and he offers Isaac as
[33:55] a sacrifice unto the Lord
[33:57] &gt;&gt; and he says, "Now I know
[33:59] &gt;&gt; that you love me."
[34:01] &gt;&gt; But then he the angel comes a second
[34:03] time and what did he say?
[34:06] He says, "Not only that now that I know
[34:07] that I love you or that you love me, but
[34:11] now your seed shall possess the gate of
[34:13] the enemy. Your seed shall be as the
[34:16] stars and as the sands of the sea." And
[34:18] this promise is going to come through
[34:20] the lineage of Isaac.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; And so the value of the bride for Isaac
[34:30] &gt;&gt; was so immense.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; That if he put it in the the lap, let's
[34:35] say, of a servant who was immature,
[34:39] &gt;&gt; and he went after the best looking girl.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; He would go after the
[34:47] &gt;&gt; gifts.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Let's talk spiritually. because we know
[34:53] that we can bring it to this day that we
[34:55] know that this is an Old Testament type
[34:59] &gt;&gt; of Ezer going and getting a bride.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; And so God sent a messenger to this day
[35:06] to get a bride ready.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; And he had to have such confidence in
[35:11] this man or else this man would go after
[35:13] the next flashy thing. He would go after
[35:15] the biggest churches.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; He would go after the almighty dollar.
[35:19] Yeah.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; He would go after the best looking
[35:21] buildings and all whatever
[35:24] &gt;&gt; and all the signs and the wonders and
[35:26] everything and say that's what God is
[35:30] &gt;&gt; and he would mess miss the very virtue
[35:33] of the bride that he was supposed to
[35:34] get.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; You see God didn't choose Paul a first
[35:42] church age messenger to bring the
[35:44] entirety of the message. Right?
[35:47] &gt;&gt; He didn't choose Luther and Wesley to
[35:49] bring it into fullness.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[35:51] &gt;&gt; He only gave those messengers apart.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; But there would come one that would be
[35:56] likened unto Elezer that he would begin
[35:58] to have the fullness
[36:00] &gt;&gt; of what the master had to offer.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Because if he gave the fullness to those
[36:10] first church age messengers, it would
[36:12] not only leave you and I out of the
[36:14] picture.
[36:15] Come on.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Because time would have to continue.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; But you see, there came a time
[36:25] and a place that God would have an
[36:28] interest in man that wouldn't be swayed
[36:30] by by certain things or by uh decisions
[36:33] that man would make. How many times did
[36:35] the prophet come in this day and people
[36:37] would offer him money and they would
[36:39] offer him cars and he would begin to
[36:41] walk away from those things. It shows
[36:44] you the very character of this
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Elezer.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; It shows you the character of that kind
[36:50] of man.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; You see, even this prophet,
[36:58] even though he was entrusted
[37:01] with all that the master had to offer,
[37:07] &gt;&gt; there was still a time that this, let's
[37:10] say, servant had to grow into that
[37:11] maturity.
[37:14] Eleazar wasn't always the eldest amongst
[37:16] the servants.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Right.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; He wasn't one that always knew how the
[37:22] master liked it.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; But it came with time
[37:28] &gt;&gt; and with teaching
[37:30] &gt;&gt; and with mistakes
[37:32] &gt;&gt; and with failures.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's good.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Are you saying brother Brandham had
[37:36] mistakes? Absolutely.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Because he was a man. He says I was just
[37:40] a man. Amen.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; But you see, when you begin to
[37:45] understand
[37:47] that as he the prophet's ministry, it's
[37:49] a progressive ministry, he would begin
[37:52] to understand that he would begin to
[37:54] grow. Brother Brandham didn't have all
[37:56] the answers in his early years of
[37:58] ministry. But what happened as his it
[38:00] begin to unfold? When did the prophet
[38:03] begin to his ministry begin to open?
[38:06] 1962 and 1963 when the seals began to
[38:09] happen,
[38:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[38:12] &gt;&gt; What is it? The older days of his
[38:14] ministry,
[38:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[38:16] &gt;&gt; When he began to get become the elder
[38:18] one amongst the message where it wasn't
[38:20] even a message then, but he began to
[38:22] come into that maturity. What happened?
[38:24] The third pool began to happen,
[38:26] &gt;&gt; right? Yeah.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; And things begin to open. But what
[38:30] happened with the people? They begin to
[38:32] walk away. Why? Because first and second
[38:34] pool, they love those wonders. They love
[38:37] those gifts that he had to offer.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; And we can get into the story of Ezer
[38:42] that he be to give uh Rebecca the gifts.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; He be to give her things a fine jewelry
[38:49] and necklace and many people in churches
[38:52] would stop there. Pentecost would stop
[38:54] there. They would stop with the gifts.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; But that's not the value.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; That's not where the value lies. Is
[39:03] there value in it? Absolutely.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; But that's not all the value.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; And so this evening, we're going to talk
[39:11] a little bit about true value.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; True value.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; With the subject of the valuation of the
[39:19] word.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; The valuation of the word.
[39:23] In Matthew 6 and 19, it says, "Lay not
[39:26] up your treasures upon earth, where moth
[39:29] and rust doth corrupt,
[39:32] &gt;&gt; and where thieves break through and
[39:33] steal, but lay up for yourselves
[39:36] treasures in heaven.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Where neither moth nor rust doth
[39:40] corrupt, and where thieves do not break
[39:42] through nor steal."
[39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; If you've ever had anybody steal
[39:47] something from you,
[39:50] &gt;&gt; it is not a pleasant experience.
[39:54] Right.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; When somebody steals something from you,
[39:56] I've had somebody steal break into my
[39:59] shr and they stole a bunch of stuff. You
[40:01] feel violated. You feel exposed. You
[40:03] feel, "How could I let this happen? What
[40:05] happened? How did it happen? Who's
[40:07] following me?"
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Who's watching me? Now you become
[40:10] paranoid.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. Yeah. But let me tell you,
[40:18] the Bible says, "For where your
[40:20] treasures is, there your heart will be
[40:23] also."
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; What happens when rust and moth begins
[40:28] to corrupt an object? We don't have it
[40:31] much out here, but back east, if you if
[40:33] you have a car and you drive it down the
[40:36] road during the winter months and you
[40:38] begin to drive it and the salt gets all
[40:39] over it, what happens?
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Begins to rust. Yeah.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; What happens when rust and corrosion
[40:46] begins to happen?
[40:48] &gt;&gt; It loses its value.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; It loses its value.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you this. Rust doesn't
[40:57] happen overnight.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Rust doesn't happen overnight.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, my treasures are this."
[41:07] And you begin to uh wonder what what
[41:10] happened. How did I get so far down the
[41:12] road?
[41:14] In your spiritual life, things begin to
[41:17] happen and you put your treasures and in
[41:19] materialistic things and things here on
[41:21] earth and you begin to value things and
[41:23] they get out of priority,
[41:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[41:27] &gt;&gt; And things begin to fall apart. That's
[41:29] what happens when rust and corrosion
[41:30] begins to happen.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Things begin to fall apart.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; And you wonder what happened? How did it
[41:38] happen? Rust doesn't happen overnight,
[41:42] &gt;&gt; right? Backsliding doesn't happen
[41:43] overnight.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Falling back doesn't happen overnight.
[41:47] It's a progression. It's something that
[41:49] happens that if you're not continually
[41:51] growing, you're not continually maturing
[41:53] in the word, if you're not continue
[41:55] unfolding as a Christian.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; For where your treasures is, there your
[42:05] heart will be also.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; So, let me say it like this. The
[42:10] treasures that you value
[42:13] show the condition of your heart.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; The treasures that you value
[42:21] &gt;&gt; shows the condition of your heart.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; It shows me where you're at as a
[42:26] Christian.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; If you show me and you tell me you don't
[42:29] value things that that should be a
[42:32] priority,
[42:34] &gt;&gt; if you don't value your family, if you
[42:36] don't value your kids or your
[42:37] relationship,
[42:38] &gt;&gt; right? If you don't value coming to
[42:41] church or or or trying to make an
[42:43] effort,
[42:44] &gt;&gt; if you don't value those things, you can
[42:46] tell me all you want.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; You can put a front on all you want.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; But it shows the condition of the heart.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was was talking to the
[43:01] young people and he says he says now
[43:03] boys and girls, but I think it's
[43:05] applicable to all of us. He says, "You
[43:07] know what?" He says, "There's a lot of
[43:09] things in the world that's real
[43:10] valuable. And one of those things is you
[43:13] have it with you today. It's the soul
[43:16] that's inside that body."
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; That's the most valuable thing in the
[43:21] world
[43:22] &gt;&gt; to you.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; That's the most valuable thing in the
[43:27] world to you.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Is that right, mother? Say amen.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Can I get a father to say amen?
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; The most valuable thing that you've got
[43:39] in your soul is your soul.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; If you don't get anything else from this
[43:44] service,
[43:46] &gt;&gt; remember this that your soul is the most
[43:49] valuable thing. And the value that you
[43:52] put on your soul,
[43:54] &gt;&gt; that is the most valuable thing.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; So, let me ask you, what happens when we
[43:59] begin as fathers and mothers, we begin
[44:02] to devalue
[44:05] our souls.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I love my little child.
[44:11] I I I cherish him. I care for his soul
[44:14] naturally." Yes, there's a value in
[44:16] that. But I want to talk about the true
[44:19] value.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; That if you begin to devalue it and you
[44:23] lose the value of that, if mama and
[44:26] daddy aren't valuing the kids' souls,
[44:29] &gt;&gt; what are the children going to value?
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. That's right.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; What are the children going to value?
[44:39] &gt;&gt; You can say you love your child,
[44:42] &gt;&gt; but yet if you keep them from church and
[44:44] you don't show the priorities of living
[44:47] a good Christian life and how to act and
[44:49] how to respond to a mother and how to
[44:52] handle certain situations.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; You see the such value of it
[44:58] &gt;&gt; and the simplicity of it.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; True.
[45:02] The most valuable thing that you've got
[45:04] is your soul.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; That's a powerful statement.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; So, let me ask you this evening, where
[45:15] is your treasures this evening?
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Is it in monetary value? Is it in things
[45:19] that are of corruptible things? Because
[45:21] as mortals, we begin to put value on
[45:24] things here on earth. And we could all
[45:26] value things differently. We can value
[45:29] experiences. We can value, you know,
[45:31] some like objects, some like cars, some
[45:33] like, you know, going on vacation. Some
[45:36] value things differently.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; And there's nothing wrong in in a value
[45:40] of those things.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; But whenever they become unbalanced,
[45:46] &gt;&gt; when there becomes an imbalance of those
[45:48] things, that's where the corruption
[45:50] comes.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; That's where the abomination comes.
[45:58] There are things as mortals as I said
[46:00] that we place value on things that we
[46:03] think that is going to bring fulfillment
[46:05] in our life. You've ever done that? You
[46:08] ever think that if I can achieve this
[46:10] goal, it is the greatest thing ever.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; And if only I can attain that, I'll I'll
[46:16] be set.
[46:18] If I can only get so much in my bank
[46:20] account, I won't have to worry again.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[46:27] I put things in this world, even as a
[46:30] young man. You go through high school
[46:33] and you play the sports and you have one
[46:34] goal and that's to win a state
[46:36] championship
[46:38] and you have such value. And as I look
[46:41] back and the reason it comes to my
[46:43] memory is cuz I just moved and you're
[46:45] going through the drawers and you find
[46:47] something,
[46:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Something that you used to value so
[46:51] much.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:53] something that you were it was a goal
[46:55] that you wish you could attain and you
[46:57] only have four years to accomplish it
[47:00] &gt;&gt; and it seemed in my small town that you
[47:02] would attain it and you attain it we
[47:04] always got runner up
[47:06] &gt;&gt; and every single time you know what
[47:08] people would say there's always next
[47:10] year
[47:13] &gt;&gt; there's always next year
[47:14] &gt;&gt; right
[47:15] &gt;&gt; there's always next year
[47:17] &gt;&gt; there's always next year listen and
[47:20] that's what happens to some Christians
[47:21] there's always next they begin to God
[47:23] begins to deal with their heart and he
[47:25] wants to put some value on things and
[47:28] you do it and then you put you know what
[47:29] there's always next year
[47:30] &gt;&gt; come on
[47:31] &gt;&gt; and you begin to put things off and I
[47:33] got tired of hearing it until finally it
[47:35] came my final year and we accomplished
[47:37] it
[47:39] &gt;&gt; and there was such a value and I and I
[47:41] put it in if if I look back
[47:45] did it did I overvalue and was it an
[47:48] imbalance at that time absolutely
[47:51] &gt;&gt; yeah Absolutely. Because I work so hard
[47:54] for it.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Something of value
[47:58] &gt;&gt; is worth working for.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Something worth value is worth earning.
[48:03] If you were given everything, it's not
[48:05] of value.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; If God gave you everything and he just
[48:09] dumped out all his blessings, what would
[48:10] it be? You'd just be a spoiled child.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; There would be no value. You wouldn't
[48:16] know the value of life. If everything
[48:18] was always green, you wouldn't know the
[48:20] very value.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; I guarantee you that brother Russell
[48:24] looks at life a little bit different.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Because when you begin to have value in
[48:28] life and Satan comes or we wouldn't even
[48:31] say Satan, but a trial comes and
[48:33] temptations come and things happen in
[48:35] your life, you begin to value it a
[48:37] little bit different.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; You begin to look at it a little bit
[48:40] different.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; That's good. Yes, sir. That's right.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; You want to find the real character of a
[48:45] man.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:48] You say, "Well, you you can find a
[48:50] character of a man when he doesn't got
[48:52] money."
[48:53] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, you can find a real
[48:55] character of man when he has money.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Because when he doesn't got money, what
[48:58] does he got to do? He's got to depend on
[49:00] God. And he's got to call on God or he's
[49:02] got to ask for help. And he's got all
[49:04] these things. But you give a man money,
[49:06] watch his character.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; See if things change. If you tell me
[49:09] that your life's changed, if you see, if
[49:11] you tell me, "Oh, I'm all better now."
[49:13] Maybe you've done, maybe you've changed,
[49:15] but give that man back some money and
[49:17] see what happens.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; See if his priorities have changed.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; The truth.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; You see, I was watching even this this
[49:33] thing popped up and it was the number
[49:35] one. A man came to a number one in his
[49:39] in his group and the thing that he was
[49:42] trying number one in the world
[49:45] and he said everything that I worked for
[49:47] everything that I wanted to achieve
[49:49] everything that it's something that you
[49:51] have a desire and as mortals and there's
[49:53] nothing wrong with wanting to achieve
[49:55] things in life because we read we read
[49:58] in the very beginning that Abraham was
[50:00] blessed in all things.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you you can be blessed in
[50:04] all things. Sure.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. True.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; God wants to bless you in all things.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; He wants to bless you in your health. He
[50:11] wants to bless you in every way that you
[50:13] want.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; He wants to bless you more than you want
[50:18] to be blessed.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; True.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; And he was blessed in all things. But
[50:22] this man, he would he he he attained the
[50:25] highest level that he ever wanted to
[50:28] achieve.
[50:29] And you know what the question he asked
[50:31] himself? What is the point?
[50:35] What is the purpose?
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; That you strive your whole life for that
[50:39] you want to achieve and you want to
[50:41] attain something so badly that you work
[50:43] your life for and you you give up and
[50:46] you sacrifice so much
[50:49] and he says I wanted to achieve it so
[50:52] badly and when I got there he asked
[50:54] himself what is the point?
[50:56] &gt;&gt; What is the purpose?
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah
[50:58] &gt;&gt; good. He said just for a moment
[51:02] &gt;&gt; that you receive this satisfaction
[51:06] &gt;&gt; that you receive this little bit of
[51:08] glory
[51:09] because let me tell you if somebody's
[51:12] wins the World Series next year there's
[51:14] another World Series next year or this
[51:17] year and then there's one next year
[51:18] &gt;&gt; and one after that and one after that.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So you're attaining something.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; And he says, "What is the value in
[51:26] that?"
[51:28] If we take it to our Bibles, the
[51:30] scripture says, "If we attain the whole
[51:31] world
[51:33] &gt;&gt; and lose our souls,
[51:35] &gt;&gt; what good is it?"
[51:37] &gt;&gt; If we live our whole life and we attain
[51:39] all these things of value that we place
[51:42] value on and we lose our souls or we
[51:45] lose our family or we lose our
[51:47] relationship with Jesus Christ.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. Help me somebody. Come on.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; If we lose those things of value,
[51:57] &gt;&gt; what is the point?
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Very good.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; And when I was thinking of the dep
[52:14] of value, now this is my definition.
[52:19] The value of something is only the
[52:21] importance you put in it
[52:23] &gt;&gt; or put on it.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; And I believe that there is true value
[52:31] to everything and something we can
[52:33] attain from everything in life.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; You say what do you mean by that?
[52:39] That in the bad times we can find value
[52:42] in it. Absolutely.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; In the good times? Absolutely. There's
[52:48] value in everything. It's all in how you
[52:50] look at it.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. True.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; You see, to get to the value of
[52:55] something, there must be a standard
[52:58] that you measure it up to.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Something of value,
[53:04] there must be a way to measure that.
[53:08] And as I begin to just read through the
[53:10] Bible and the the Bible talks about
[53:12] weights and balances and if you could
[53:14] bring the picture up so we have a visual
[53:17] if they have it
[53:20] because when we look at these things of
[53:22] weights and measures maybe they don't
[53:24] have it. It's okay.
[53:27] But you begin to see that throughout
[53:30] scripture.
[53:31] I didn't put this together. I just found
[53:33] it.
[53:37] But you begin to see that weights and
[53:39] measures are weighed differently in
[53:42] scripture. That all down through the Old
[53:44] Testament and the New Testament, you can
[53:46] see that if you were a man, it's not
[53:48] like today that you know it's so easy
[53:50] that you go to the grocery store and you
[53:52] you trade something off or you just
[53:54] spend a dollar.
[53:56] Now, there's certain places in the world
[53:58] that yeah, you will have to trade a
[54:00] chicken for something.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[54:05] But here in the US, you just trade the
[54:08] dollar. That's the standard
[54:09] &gt;&gt; in which we live by. But in the Old
[54:11] Testament, in order to do any business,
[54:14] if you wanted to trade some dry weight
[54:16] of wheat or whatever it was, and you
[54:19] wanted to trade it for some water, 10
[54:22] bass equal one homer of of wheat there.
[54:26] And so there was certain measurements
[54:28] and weights. And if you begin to do
[54:30] business and you would see that uh 1/2
[54:33] cubit is 9 in long. It's from this
[54:36] fingertip to this fingertip. And a cubit
[54:39] is from this fingertip to the tip of
[54:41] your elbow. So now can you imagine going
[54:44] around and that's how you did
[54:45] measurements.
[54:48] I shouldn't want to do business with
[54:50] brother David over here.
[54:53] I'd get the short end,
[54:59] but all down through and I love it
[55:02] because it came and I found this and it
[55:04] says the standard tends to vary slightly
[55:06] over time.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[55:09] &gt;&gt; And the following are approximations
[55:11] based on what we know from archeological
[55:15] findings.
[55:17] says, "Oftent times merchants carried
[55:19] multiple sets of weights to use
[55:21] depending on whether they were buying or
[55:23] selling
[55:24] &gt;&gt; in order to teach the people they were
[55:27] dealing with.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Look at that."
[55:30] &gt;&gt; They carried multiple weights and
[55:32] measures.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Let me read that again. Often times,
[55:35] Christians would carry different sets of
[55:37] clothing.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; They would carry different things to
[55:42] whatever way they wanted to lean.
[55:46] They're trying to cheat the system.
[55:48] They're trying to get by. They're trying
[55:49] to wade in the balance over here.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. You can't
[55:54] cheat God.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; You can't cheat God. God will find you
[56:00] out.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; There's no need to carry different
[56:04] weights and measures and standard.
[56:05] There's only one standard and that is
[56:07] his word.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; And when you begin to understand and go
[56:10] by his word, you can never fail. This is
[56:13] a perfect, just, and balanced word.
[56:15] Amen.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Because Proverbs 11:1 says, "A false
[56:21] balance is an abomination to the Lord."
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Man, that is a strong word.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; That is a very strong word. Abomination.
[56:31] It's not just that he dislikes it or
[56:33] disapproves it or he's not okay with it.
[56:35] No, it's an abomination.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Look at that.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; An abomination is a thing that disgusts
[56:42] or brings hatred. It is hateful. It is
[56:47] sinful. It is wicked. It is vile.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; I don't want no part to do with any of
[56:53] that.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; But a just way
[56:56] &gt;&gt; is his delight.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16:22 says, "All the ways of a
[57:03] man are clean in his own eyes."
[57:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; But the Lord weighth the spirit.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; You see, God sometimes he weighs the
[57:13] spirit.
[57:16] Let me give you a word of advice.
[57:18] Sometimes you need to weigh the spirit.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you you you need to use some
[57:23] discernment.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Because if you're walking around and
[57:28] you're just going about and you're
[57:32] you begin to look at things and every
[57:34] man is right in his own eyes,
[57:38] &gt;&gt; but if you're not careful and you don't
[57:40] weigh the spirit.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; True. Some men look good on the outside.
[57:45] That's
[57:45] &gt;&gt; right.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Some things can be said in a way.
[57:50] And I looked at this word weth
[57:55] and the word weth means to con means to
[57:58] balance the measure or assess. In this
[58:01] context, the definition says it
[58:03] signifies that God careful and just
[58:06] evaluates the spirit's motives
[58:09] &gt;&gt; behind the action.
[58:12] You know there are sometimes that there
[58:13] are motives behind people's action.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; And if you don't spiritually discern
[58:19] things that are happening amongst you
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16:11, "A just weight and a
[58:32] balance are the Lord's, and all the
[58:34] weights of the bag are his work."
[58:38] All the weights of the bag
[58:40] &gt;&gt; are his word. And so in today's society
[58:44] here in America, everything is valued by
[58:46] the dollar. The dollar is the standard.
[58:50] You can go to the store, you can buy
[58:51] something, either pull out the credit
[58:53] card or you throw them cash. Cash isn't
[58:56] even a thing now. Most people don't even
[58:58] take cash.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; A cashless society.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; They're trying to get you to spend
[59:04] things on credit and money that you
[59:05] don't even have. That's right.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; So true.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; You go to the store and you buy things
[59:14] by the dollar. Now, we're talking about
[59:17] value here,
[59:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Because when you travel the world, you
[59:21] begin to realize that this dollar value
[59:24] begins to change.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, it does.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; That it begins to change one way or the
[59:30] other. If you go to Mexico, it's 18 to1.
[59:33] 18 pesos to $1. If you go to Canada,
[59:36] it's $136 to1. Australia, $153 to1.
[59:42] If you want to feel real good about your
[59:44] money, you can go to Vonatu for $119 for
[59:46] one,
[59:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; And you know it comes to me saying that
[59:56] because many people find let me say this
[59:59] like Mexicans
[1:00:02] they find and I deal with guys and
[1:00:04] that's their mentality that instead end
[1:00:06] up dealing with it hard and they come
[1:00:08] over here and what they do they make
[1:00:09] money and send it back
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; and they retire in Mexico.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Let me say there's no way for us as
[1:00:15] Christians.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; That's not our inheritance. That's not
[1:00:19] our plan. That's not our saving to go
[1:00:22] and to retire in a cheap place. No,
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; our place is heaven.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Our treasures are not here.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; But as you begin to see this value
[1:00:34] dollar begins to change.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:37] This news article flashed and I seen it
[1:00:40] that a $100,000 salary in January of
[1:00:45] 2020 has the same buying power as
[1:00:48] 124,000 in April of 2025.
[1:00:52] Meaning that that 25% drop in value
[1:00:56] to your dollar buys less today than it
[1:00:59] did just 5 years ago.
[1:01:02] From groceries to gas, housing to health
[1:01:05] care, inflation is quietly chipped away
[1:01:07] at the middle class incomes. Even
[1:01:10] earning six figures are feeling the
[1:01:12] squeeze in today's economy.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; true.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; This statistic is a wakeup call. Listen
[1:01:18] to this. This statistic is a wakeup
[1:01:20] call. If your income hasn't risen with
[1:01:22] the inflation,
[1:01:25] you're effectively earning less than you
[1:01:27] were in 2020.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:31] the same dollar, but now it's losing
[1:01:34] value.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have the same buying power.
[1:01:37] And as I begin to think on this buying
[1:01:39] power that if you're spiritual, natural
[1:01:42] types of spiritual, and if you're
[1:01:44] naturally losing the value on that, what
[1:01:48] about your spiritual life?
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; What about your spiritual buying power
[1:01:53] today? If your walk with Jesus Christ is
[1:01:56] the same as it was 5 years ago,
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; if your joy that you had just last year,
[1:02:01] if your understanding and revelation is
[1:02:03] the same as last year, your buying power
[1:02:05] isn't enough for today.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the closer we get, the
[1:02:09] tighter the squeeze, the closer we get
[1:02:12] to this end time, the tighter that
[1:02:14] squeeze is going to be. The pressure is
[1:02:16] going to be harder. The trials are going
[1:02:18] to be harder. The temptation's going to
[1:02:20] be harder. So if your faith isn't
[1:02:22] growing to match today,
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; your buying power isn't enough.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; So let me tell you, it's time to get
[1:02:29] more buying power. It's time to increase
[1:02:32] your understanding. It's time to
[1:02:34] increase your revelation of God's word.
[1:02:36] It's time to put more time into God's
[1:02:39] word
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; and put value in things that God sees
[1:02:43] value in.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Very good. Amen.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Beautiful. So true.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; If your love hasn't increased,
[1:02:53] something's wrong.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; If your worship hasn't increased,
[1:03:02] something's wrong.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you saints, God inhabits the
[1:03:08] praises of his people. We don't just
[1:03:11] come to church and just sit on a pew and
[1:03:13] fulfill a duty of sitting here, but we
[1:03:16] come and bring our worship and our
[1:03:18] admiration unto him.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Or help.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; If our commitment to Christ
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; hasn't increased,
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; the buying power isn't enough. Right.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; The buying power. What is that buying
[1:03:40] power? It's the power that's going to
[1:03:42] take you home.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; It's that Holy Ghost in power.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, God doesn't
[1:03:50] devalue.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; He doesn't.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; God hasn't changed.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; But it's our value that we place on the
[1:03:56] things of God. Those are the things that
[1:03:58] Satan, what he does, if we can do it in
[1:04:00] this way, that Satan in his inflation,
[1:04:03] he begins to cause things to rise up. He
[1:04:06] begins to cause trials to come our way.
[1:04:08] He becomes he he inflates temptation in
[1:04:11] our lives and it begins to deviate our
[1:04:13] value
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; from the importance.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; You see when the squeeze begins to
[1:04:23] happen,
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; it's not if, but when.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; And if any of you aren't feeling the
[1:04:29] squeeze,
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; that squeeze is coming on so strong. You
[1:04:33] better thank God for the freedom that we
[1:04:35] have tonight. You better thank God for
[1:04:37] the opportunities and not take it
[1:04:39] lightly because the squeeze is going to
[1:04:41] get tighter and it's going to get
[1:04:43] tighter and it's going to get harder and
[1:04:44] it's going to get harder. Why?
[1:04:48] Because just as Satan is increasing, so
[1:04:51] is God.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; When that squeeze begins to come from
[1:04:57] all sides, what happens? Look up. Your
[1:04:59] redemption drawth nigh. There's only one
[1:05:02] way to go. When there's nowhere else to
[1:05:04] go, it's going to be up. And that is the
[1:05:06] buying power that's going to get you out
[1:05:08] of here.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; What I've realized,
[1:05:21] depending on the stage that you're in,
[1:05:27] the stage of life that you are is where
[1:05:29] the value begins to shift.
[1:05:33] And there's nothing wrong in that.
[1:05:38] That whenever you're at a place that you
[1:05:41] understand, if we can put it simple,
[1:05:43] that kids, they do not have to worry
[1:05:46] right now at the stage that they're in
[1:05:48] of what career they're going to choose,
[1:05:52] what path they're going to take. No,
[1:05:53] they're just kids. One day my kid wants
[1:05:55] to be a firefighter, the next day he
[1:05:57] wants to be a cowboy. Nobody can tell me
[1:06:00] he can't be an Indian. You know, there's
[1:06:01] things that as kids, there's no value in
[1:06:04] what they want to be.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; But you see the value, it begins to
[1:06:12] change. Teenagers, they don't think of
[1:06:14] what what what their 401 is going to
[1:06:17] produce at the end of their life.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's out of balance.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; I don't expect you to do that.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Because it's in balance. But we want to
[1:06:27] have a balance in the stage that you're
[1:06:29] living in
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; that as you walk with Christ and you
[1:06:32] begin to adjust. I don't expect you to
[1:06:34] have a revelation of somebody else and
[1:06:36] oh, you know, grow at a certain rate.
[1:06:38] No, no, no. You grow as God sees fit.
[1:06:41] You grow as the revelation comes to you.
[1:06:43] You unfold as God begins to show himself
[1:06:46] to you.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; And the values begin to change.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, they do.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; But there comes a time of maturity and
[1:06:54] growth. Paul says, "When I was a child,
[1:06:57] I spake as a child. I understood as a
[1:07:00] child. I thought as a child, I put value
[1:07:02] on things as a child."
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; I put value on certain things that there
[1:07:09] wasn't much value on.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; But that's okay. But when you become a
[1:07:13] man,
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; But when I become a man, I put away
[1:07:18] those childish things.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; I put away those childish things.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. I think it's time for some to
[1:07:25] grow up.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; It's time to grow up. It's time to come
[1:07:31] into a place, a position, and placing as
[1:07:34] sons and daughters of God.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; You can't stay a child forever.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; You can't stay a child forever.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; If you're not growing and maturing and
[1:07:46] learning,
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; there's something wrong.
[1:07:50] Yes.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; The actual definition of value is the
[1:07:54] regards of something is held to deserve
[1:07:56] the important worth or usefulness of
[1:07:59] something.
[1:08:01] A person's principle or standard of
[1:08:03] behavior,
[1:08:06] one's judgment of what is important in
[1:08:08] life, values.
[1:08:11] And when you begin to change your
[1:08:12] values,
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; when you begin to change your values of
[1:08:17] because of the people that you hang
[1:08:18] around, something's wrong.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; And can I give you a warning that it's
[1:08:26] not just changing your values for people
[1:08:28] out in the world? That's that's easy to
[1:08:30] notice.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; That when you begin to adjust, but let
[1:08:33] me tell you, there's going to be ones
[1:08:35] that call themselves message that you're
[1:08:37] going to have to hold your values.
[1:08:38] You're going to have to hold your
[1:08:39] standards. You're going to have to be an
[1:08:41] example. Why? You might not fit feel
[1:08:43] like you fit in. Why? Because you say,
[1:08:45] "Well, well, this church does it or this
[1:08:47] church allows it."
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Values. And you begin to lower the
[1:08:52] values and the standards.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; You see, there's nothing wrong
[1:09:03] in putting values in those things. In
[1:09:06] fact, it's a must to have values in
[1:09:08] certain things. If you put a value in
[1:09:11] education, there's nothing wrong. We
[1:09:13] should all learn to read and write.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; But there is a true value in it.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; That whenever you begin to take it too
[1:09:20] far
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; or you become imbalanced with it. It's
[1:09:24] the same with a career. There's nothing
[1:09:26] wrong in providing for your family.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong in that. But when
[1:09:33] it becomes imbalanced,
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; it takes away the value of it.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; The value of kids. I think this is a big
[1:09:45] one.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says
[1:09:50] that kids and children are the
[1:09:53] inheritance of the Lord.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; They're things that they're ones that
[1:09:58] God has given us to look over, to
[1:10:00] oversee. Yes.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; To be able to show them the values of
[1:10:05] life.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; To be able to show and to tell your
[1:10:09] young ladies how to be a lady. To be
[1:10:11] able to tell your young men how to be
[1:10:13] grown men.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; How to have respect for elders. How to
[1:10:17] open the door.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; But in a society, we begin to lose the
[1:10:21] simplicity of life.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; We begin to lose those things of what we
[1:10:26] think is just such that's not that big
[1:10:28] of a deal, right?
[1:10:33] Fathers, you need to teach your
[1:10:35] daughters the value that lays within
[1:10:37] them.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't tell them the value
[1:10:41] that they have, the worth that they
[1:10:43] have,
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; somebody else will.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Some other man is going to tell you how
[1:10:50] valuable they are.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Or you can play the other side that
[1:10:54] Satan's going to come in and he's going
[1:10:56] to begin to tell them and devalue who
[1:10:58] they are. He's going to use things as
[1:11:01] you don't fit in, you don't look pretty
[1:11:03] enough, you need to add a little bit of
[1:11:05] this, you need to do these things. What
[1:11:07] is he doing? He's devaluing the worth,
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; the true value of what lays inside of
[1:11:12] you.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; There's value in these simple things.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:27] True value is
[1:11:29] when you lead by example.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; True value.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Is when you lead by example.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; You don't tell them, show them.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; True, brother.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Don't tell them, show them how to do it.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Show them how to be a gentleman.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Show them how to be a lady.
[1:11:55] Because if we lose the simplicity of the
[1:11:57] gospel,
[1:11:58] if we lose the simple things in life,
[1:12:01] what happens to this message?
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; If we lose the value of God's word and
[1:12:06] the standard he's given us,
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; What happens to it?
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Come on. Good.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; You see, Satan wants to devalue.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Satan wants to devalue and tear down
[1:12:23] He wants to tell you what you're not and
[1:12:25] what you can't do and who you're not and
[1:12:27] that you don't fit in and you're not in
[1:12:29] this message and you make a mistake and
[1:12:31] you fall down. Let me tell you, if you
[1:12:33] fall down, it doesn't devalue who you
[1:12:35] are.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take away of you being a son
[1:12:38] or daughter of God. Just get back up and
[1:12:40] keep walking.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Because we've all made mistakes. We've
[1:12:43] all fallen down.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; We've all had hard times. We've all lost
[1:12:49] value in certain things.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; True. But just get back to the value of
[1:12:54] what God said.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; The power of transformation. Our
[1:13:00] redemption wasn't cheap. Wasn't a cheap
[1:13:03] thing. It was the son of God had to die
[1:13:06] for us. See?
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; It isn't. Things of value come at a
[1:13:10] great price.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; To bring this message, it wasn't easy.
[1:13:14] See, no, it isn't. I had to forsake
[1:13:17] everything that was dear to me, even my
[1:13:19] own people, everybody. But you see the
[1:13:21] value of it is you see is to do the will
[1:13:25] of God.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; You have to come to a place that that's
[1:13:28] where your value lies. It doesn't matter
[1:13:30] if your mom or your dad doesn't come. It
[1:13:33] doesn't matter what value they place on
[1:13:35] things. What are you valuing right now?
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Our redemption wasn't cheap.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; The price that had to be paid all down
[1:13:48] through the ages.
[1:13:50] It wasn't cheap.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you, what true value do you
[1:13:58] place on the message
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; as an individual?
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; What value do you place on this message
[1:14:06] of the hour?
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Because there's a true value that you
[1:14:10] must find within this message.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Because you can put a value on the
[1:14:16] Bible.
[1:14:18] Sure. There is value in this,
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; but there's a true value.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; There's a value on a God-s prophet.
[1:14:26] Absolutely.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; There's value in the messages and in the
[1:14:31] tapes that he has.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; But let me ask you, what value is it if
[1:14:37] you don't read it?
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; What value does this have?
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. If you don't pick it up
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; and you begin to partake of it, what
[1:14:50] value does it bring you? Nothing.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; If you said, "Brother James,
[1:14:59] I want to diet. I want to go on a diet.
[1:15:01] Do you have a book that you could give
[1:15:03] me?" Yeah, sure.
[1:15:05] And I give you a book
[1:15:08] and you look at it and you say, "Okay,
[1:15:10] day one, you got to do this and this.
[1:15:12] Day two, you got to run a mile.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Day three, you got to do this. You got
[1:15:17] to eat healthier. You got to do this.
[1:15:20] But if this just sits on your
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; table and you say, "Well, I want to go
[1:15:24] on a diet. I want to lose weight."
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Well, the answer is right there.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; But if you never pick it up and go
[1:15:30] through it.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother. Come on.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; If you never partake of it, if you never
[1:15:34] put it into action,
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; if you never get into it, it does no
[1:15:39] value.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:15:43] So what happens
[1:15:47] you begin to
[1:15:50] want to do it a different way
[1:15:53] because many times as us humans we want
[1:15:55] to go the easy route. So if you want to
[1:15:58] lose weight and you want to do all this
[1:15:59] and you do it and I'm not against it but
[1:16:02] people it just came as people want to go
[1:16:05] the way of Ozimpic and you you can take
[1:16:07] a shot and lose weight.
[1:16:10] You laugh, but it's true.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; And what happens? They don't change the
[1:16:15] way they eat.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; They don't change the way they live,
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; And what happens now?
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Doesn't do anything.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, for a time it works.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, it works. And you'll start losing
[1:16:30] weight.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; But what happens when you stop taking
[1:16:33] it? You put the weight back on.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:37] And many times Christians want an oimpic
[1:16:40] religion.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; That they don't want to change their
[1:16:43] diet.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; They don't want to change the way that
[1:16:45] they're living. They don't want to do
[1:16:47] the the hard way. They don't want to
[1:16:48] begin to work out and put in the work
[1:16:50] and put in the time, put in the effort,
[1:16:52] begin to eat the diet of the word.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; They want the easy way. So, give me an
[1:16:58] oyic experience. Yeah,
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; give me an Oimpic religion that I could
[1:17:04] just take a shot and keep living and
[1:17:06] eating the way I am.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; That I can eat my dessert.
[1:17:12] I could do all those things, still live
[1:17:14] the same way. I say, God, help us.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; I say, God, help us.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; To find the true value of it. Because
[1:17:21] whenever you begin to uh put value in
[1:17:24] this, yes, there's value in the Bible,
[1:17:26] but that's not all of it. There's value
[1:17:28] in those tapes. Absolutely. But there's
[1:17:31] a true value that you will find when you
[1:17:33] get into that. When you begin to partake
[1:17:35] of it, when you say, "Be it unto me."
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; The true value lies not when you believe
[1:17:53] it, but it's when you apply it to your
[1:17:55] life. Yes.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; The true value lies in the application
[1:18:00] of it.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; The true value isn't knowing
[1:18:06] what he said, but it's applying what he
[1:18:09] said.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; It's not just knowing it. Let me tell
[1:18:12] you, Satan knows this message.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Satan knows the Bible. Satan comes to
[1:18:16] church. Satan sits on the pew. He's
[1:18:19] faithful.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; But it's applying it to your life
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; is what makes the difference.
[1:18:25] Amen.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; You see this message is going to become
[1:18:32] such a value.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would explain it in such
[1:18:37] a way that this is love, God's love
[1:18:39] letter given to man.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; You think back on World War I whenever
[1:18:45] they would go off to war, what would
[1:18:47] they do? There was no forms of being
[1:18:50] able to ha have a communication back and
[1:18:53] forth but to write a letter. So there in
[1:18:55] a time of war, men would sit down or
[1:18:58] they would take a a love letter that was
[1:19:00] given to them by their wife and they
[1:19:02] would begin to read it and sit down and
[1:19:04] they could read it over and over. Why?
[1:19:05] Because it was the only thing that they
[1:19:07] had of her. There was only thing that
[1:19:09] that would bring her back was this love
[1:19:12] letter.
[1:19:15] And God has sent his love letter down.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Just to you
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; that you might cherish it, that you
[1:19:22] might look upon it and read it and begin
[1:19:24] to take the promises of this book and
[1:19:27] apply it to your life.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; He says, I I wrote you a He says, "If I
[1:19:35] wrote you a letter, I believe that we
[1:19:36] are friends enough that you would
[1:19:38] appreciate it and you would wrote you
[1:19:40] would wrote me back. I would appreciate
[1:19:42] it. He says, "But if your letter was
[1:19:45] just addressed to me after I read it, it
[1:19:47] would not be so valuable
[1:19:50] or would be not valuable to anyone else.
[1:19:53] It would be a letter that was directed
[1:19:55] to me or my letter directed to you and
[1:19:57] after it was once read, it could be
[1:20:00] discarded unless you just keep it as a
[1:20:03] relic."
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; I think many times within the message,
[1:20:08] people have too many things that are
[1:20:09] relics.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They put too much value on.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; I'll leave that one.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; But oh, it's not so with the word of God
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; because it was not addressed to any
[1:20:24] certain individual. It was addressed to
[1:20:26] all Adam's race, all Adam's fallen race,
[1:20:29] to every mortal being. That's why it's
[1:20:31] so valuable. Just one word, you can hang
[1:20:34] on to it with all that's in you and know
[1:20:37] that it is true. God said all scripture
[1:20:40] must be fulfilled. And he says heavens
[1:20:42] and earth will pass away but my word
[1:20:45] will never fail.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; My word will never fail. The value of
[1:20:50] one word from almighty God. Why do you
[1:20:52] come to church? Why do you come on
[1:20:54] Sundays and Wednesday to hear his word?
[1:20:56] Because one word might make a
[1:20:58] difference. One thing that is said might
[1:21:00] help you along the way. One prayer, one
[1:21:03] song that's
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; sang.
[1:21:06] True.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:08] You see the English dictionary, we say
[1:21:10] it, we say thousands of words every
[1:21:12] single day and there's no value really
[1:21:14] in it. But when it comes to God's word
[1:21:17] and the way it's placed, you can take
[1:21:20] every promise.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; And apply it to your life.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; He says, "Sometimes it means a lot.
[1:21:29] Sometimes it cost you something. And
[1:21:31] anything that anything that doesn't cost
[1:21:34] you something isn't worth having."
[1:21:36] Right?
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; All great things has to be paid for.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; And this religion that we have and this
[1:21:42] Pentecostal Holy Spirit that has set us
[1:21:45] bring back the resurrected Jesus Christ
[1:21:47] alive after 1900 years is worth all our
[1:21:51] time,
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; all our effort. Everything that we do,
[1:21:54] it's worth all to us.
[1:21:57] [Music]
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Last one. And he says in this portion of
[1:22:04] scripture he says I have it under
[1:22:06] consideration for the text. He says just
[1:22:09] five little words. He says what makes
[1:22:13] but what makes what it what it is is
[1:22:16] it's the scripture. The valuation of the
[1:22:19] word the word is so valuable. No matter
[1:22:23] if it's one little word it's valuable.
[1:22:26] It's the valuable word. The word was in
[1:22:28] the beginning a thought of God and then
[1:22:31] it began after a thought. A thought is a
[1:22:34] word is a thought expressed.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; And when God thinks of anything,
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; then when he expresses his thought, it
[1:22:41] becomes a signed document.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; And everything that God is worth and
[1:22:45] everything that God is is behind that
[1:22:50] word.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Everything that God is worth and
[1:22:53] everything that he is. That's why
[1:22:55] Abraham could send Eleazar with
[1:22:57] everything that he had. Why? Because he
[1:23:00] had a signed document that was paid. He
[1:23:02] had a decree that was going out to go
[1:23:04] find me a bribe. Bring him back for my
[1:23:07] do my son.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; And he entrusted him with everything.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; He says no man is any better than his
[1:23:18] word. All the Bible is is the prophets
[1:23:20] who went who has went up into a place
[1:23:22] where we spoke today as eagles. For in
[1:23:25] the beginning, God knew everything that
[1:23:28] would ever be
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; from the very first beginning. You see
[1:23:32] the value of the word.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; You see, that's the power of God's word.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; That's the power of prayer.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; That's the power of things that God has
[1:23:46] given us. is not just something that we
[1:23:48] we say a prayer and it goes up. But
[1:23:50] brother Brandham says that prayer goes
[1:23:52] up and it goes and finds a resting
[1:23:55] place.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; He would begin to tell us through a
[1:23:57] story of the man that stole that
[1:23:59] brother's car. And they would be driving
[1:24:01] down the road and he came up to brother
[1:24:03] Brandham. He says, "I left my keys in
[1:24:04] this and my car is stolen. Will you say
[1:24:07] a prayer?" Brother Brandham says he says
[1:24:09] the prayer and it goes up and he begins
[1:24:11] to wander around and he goes into that
[1:24:14] vision. He finds it down the road. Yeah.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; And he says, "What did it do? The very
[1:24:19] word that he spoke." Listen, there's
[1:24:21] power in the words that you speak. And
[1:24:23] when the word goes up, it begins to go
[1:24:26] and find. And it begins to search and it
[1:24:29] finds the bedding ground in which it's
[1:24:31] meant to fulfill. Yeah.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; When your needs come become before the
[1:24:38] people, it's not just writing it on a
[1:24:40] piece of paper,
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; but when it's presented and it begins to
[1:24:44] go and somebody comes and prays, what
[1:24:47] happens? That prayer goes up and it goes
[1:24:50] and finds that individual. Listen, when
[1:24:52] we begin to pray for brother Russell,
[1:24:54] what happens? Angels begin to go and
[1:24:57] find them and begin to minister unto him
[1:25:00] healing and virtue. Why? Amen.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Because it's God's word.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; There's power in God's word.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; There's power in prayer.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; That's what makes the difference.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; That's what makes the difference.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; If God would tell us that, the prophet
[1:25:19] would tell us five minutes in the
[1:25:21] presence of almighty God can make the
[1:25:23] difference.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; If it did it with Moses, it can do it
[1:25:26] with each one of us.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; That's true, brother. Five minutes.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Five minutes in his presence.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; I want you to think of that.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Five minutes of time.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; You might be going through the hardest
[1:25:46] thing right now.
[1:25:48] That's
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; You might be going through something
[1:25:50] that might be unbearable.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why do I come to church?"
[1:25:56] Because five minutes will do.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Just five minutes.
[1:26:00] That's right.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; I say God, help us give them that five
[1:26:04] minutes. If it takes a minute, if it
[1:26:06] takes a half minute,
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; if it takes one word,
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; let it go forth.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:20] You see, my treasure don't only lie in a
[1:26:23] place where I'm going, but my treasure
[1:26:26] lies in the word that he's given us for
[1:26:29] this day.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; That's where my treasure lies.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Because I believe that we can have
[1:26:37] spiritual treasure here on earth. I
[1:26:39] believe that we can have spiritual
[1:26:40] blessings here on earth.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; I believe that God can pour some things
[1:26:44] out and give us a overflowing of
[1:26:46] blessings
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; here on earth. We don't have to wait to
[1:26:49] heaven to get be able to walk on streets
[1:26:52] of gold to be able to tell of how great
[1:26:54] God is. No, I'm not going to wait until
[1:26:56] I get to that over there. Yes, it's
[1:26:59] going to be a wonderful time and that's
[1:27:00] where my treasure is and that's where my
[1:27:02] home is.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, there's treasures
[1:27:07] here on earth that we can partake of.
[1:27:09] There's things that we can have here on
[1:27:10] earth. Let me tell you, it's an untapped
[1:27:13] resource.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; That we are living below our privileges.
[1:27:17] Help us Lord.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; From where your treasure is, there your
[1:27:24] heart will be. Also,
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; first Peter one says, "Bless,
[1:27:31] blessed be the God of our fathers and
[1:27:33] our Lord Jesus Christ, which is
[1:27:34] according to his abundant mercy, hath
[1:27:37] begotten us again unto a lively hope."
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; That's a lively hope, saints.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; It's a lively hope. It's a living hope.
[1:27:45] How do I know it's alive? Because
[1:27:47] there's testimonies because you and I
[1:27:49] are testimonies that it's a lively hope.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; By the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[1:27:57] the dead to an inheritance
[1:27:59] incorruptible, undefiled, that fadeth
[1:28:01] not away, reserved in heaven for you
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; who are kept by the power of God.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Who are kept by the power of God. It's
[1:28:10] not you keeping yourself. You can't keep
[1:28:13] yourself. Let me tell you, if you try to
[1:28:15] keep yourself, you're going to fall.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; But you are kept by the power of
[1:28:19] Almighty God.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Through faith unto salvation, ready to
[1:28:25] be revealed in the last day,
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; last time,
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; wherein we greatly rejoice, though now
[1:28:32] for a season, if need be, you are in
[1:28:35] heaven in heaviness through manifold
[1:28:39] temptations.
[1:28:40] Does anybody know what manifold
[1:28:42] temptation is? I had to look it up.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Manifold temptation,
[1:28:50] it implies that the temptations come in
[1:28:52] many forms and not
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; uniform.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; They can be physical, emotional, and
[1:28:59] spiritual in nature.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; So what are you telling me? It's life.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; It's life.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. None of us are exempt from it.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; None of us are exempt from it, saints.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Manifold temptations, they come and it's
[1:29:18] just life.
[1:29:20] So if you come under the heaviness of
[1:29:22] that, let me tell you it says greatly
[1:29:25] rejoice
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; that the trial of your faith being more
[1:29:32] precious than gold that perish though it
[1:29:35] be tried with fire might be found unto
[1:29:38] praise and honor and gloring at the
[1:29:40] peering of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Whom having not seen ye love in whom
[1:29:46] though now ye see him not yet believe.
[1:29:49] Yeah,
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; you rejoice with joy unspeakable
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; and full of glory.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; That you rejoice.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; That you rejoice, saints.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; It's not a time of heaviness and weary.
[1:30:02] Though we are in dark times, though we
[1:30:04] are in time of heaviness, but you must
[1:30:06] rejoice.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Be of good cheer.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's it.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus told Thomas, "Blessed is he who
[1:30:14] has not seen.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; You have seen."
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. But blessed is he who has not seen
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; and still believes.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Musicians come.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; You see, Eleazar
[1:30:29] in the beginning
[1:30:32] went to get a bride for Isaac
[1:30:35] and he came to a place
[1:30:38] to a well that he prayed.
[1:30:42] And he prayed a prayer
[1:30:46] and he says that this woman would speak
[1:30:50] and say, "I will not only give you water
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; but your camels also."
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; You see, there's something for us to do.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; You can place value on the messenger.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; And as time would go on,
[1:31:09] he found Rebecca there. Yeah.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; And they would begin to commune back and
[1:31:14] forth
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; and he would give her gifts
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; of earrings and jewelry
[1:31:27] and he would ask her, "Is there a place
[1:31:29] for me in your inn or in your house in
[1:31:32] your father's house?"
[1:31:35] Now, if you put yourself in the reality
[1:31:37] of it that a stranger comes
[1:31:41] to one of you sisters and says, "Here's
[1:31:44] some jewelry. Do you have place for me
[1:31:47] to lodge in my camels?"
[1:31:53] It's kind of unsettling. It's one of
[1:31:55] those things that what would I do in
[1:31:57] that situation?
[1:32:01] But he says, "Is there a place?" and she
[1:32:02] says there is room.
[1:32:06] And as he would go on and they would
[1:32:07] begin to talk with the family,
[1:32:12] they would ask the
[1:32:15] family
[1:32:17] if he could have her.
[1:32:21] And he says, "You would have to ask the
[1:32:23] woman."
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Go ask her. Go ask the damsel. See what
[1:32:27] comes out of her mouth.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; She willing. Yes sir. Come on.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; What did she say?
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; I will go.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; I will go.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; I will go. You see her family wanted her
[1:32:42] to terry there for a while. He said give
[1:32:44] us 10 days. Give us a few days that we
[1:32:46] can spend some time.
[1:32:50] But you see when the time is at hand.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; There's no stopping it.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:59] Each one of us has to make the same
[1:33:01] commitment and say I will go.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; I will forsake father. I'll forsake
[1:33:06] mother.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; And say I will go.
[1:33:12] [Music]
[1:33:15] And we know the story
[1:33:17] [Music]
[1:33:19] that as she would come into Isaac,
[1:33:22] and I think it's so amazing because the
[1:33:25] Bible says that Isaac
[1:33:28] when he seen her a far off, he would go
[1:33:30] and he would get her and she would veil
[1:33:32] herself and hop off the camel.
[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:38] But let me tell you,
[1:33:41] she had value placed on the gifts that
[1:33:43] he gave her.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Value on the message.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Sir. Yes.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; On the messenger. Let me say that.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; But as they were going to meet Isaac.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; She would ask Eleazar, "Tell me what he
[1:33:58] likes."
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; What is Isaac really like? Yeah.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; And we had a prophet come in this day
[1:34:04] and he would begin to preach sermons of
[1:34:07] choosing a bride, things that are to be.
[1:34:10] He would begin to tell us of things that
[1:34:12] are going to happen,
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; The restoration of the bride tree.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[1:34:19] Sermons that are telling us,
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; showing us his love language,
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; ministering unto us. It's a love letter
[1:34:28] that he's given us. Yes. Amen.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; And there's value in it. There's value
[1:34:33] in the gifts.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; But when they got to Isaac, they left
[1:34:38] all that behind.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; They didn't place as much value on that.
[1:34:43] Why? When we get to heaven,
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; All the Bibles will be stacked.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; They'll be all stacked up.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; You won't need the love letter
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; when you have the lover.
[1:34:59] Yes, sir.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; One that you've been waiting
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; your whole life for.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; One you've been waiting to sit in his
[1:35:09] presence.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:17] [Music]
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; What will it be like
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; to sit in the presence of Almighty God?
[1:35:27] Oh my.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. You won't be
[1:35:33] disappointed.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Everything of life that you've been
[1:35:38] through.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:41] [Music]
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; The true value lies in the message that
[1:35:50] he brought.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Because the message gets you to the
[1:35:56] person.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Don't get things out of balance.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; I love the prophet. There's so much
[1:36:08] value in what he said. There's value in
[1:36:10] those tapes. You better get into those
[1:36:12] tapes.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; You better listen to what he said. You
[1:36:15] better get into the scriptures.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; There's value in it. Yeah.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; But you got to fall in love with him.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; You got to apply it to your life.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; When everything is said and done and you
[1:36:30] get into the presence of almighty God,
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; it'll all be worth it.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; The prophet would tell us, "Don't miss
[1:36:39] it."
[1:36:44] Yes,
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; sir, brother.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't miss it.
[1:36:49] That's right.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do to got that you got to
[1:36:54] do to put value
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; and align yourself and bring your life
[1:36:58] back into balance. Isaiah do it.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; It's not too late.
[1:37:08] [Music]
[1:37:10] You see, if I was to
[1:37:13] place a value on an instrument,
[1:37:17] this guitar, that could guitar could
[1:37:20] have been ordained to go and play some
[1:37:22] country song. It could been out in some
[1:37:25] concert. It can be in the hands
[1:37:28] of some popular star.
[1:37:31] [Music]
[1:37:40] The value doesn't lie in the guitar.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Until it's played.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Has monetary value in that guitar.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:00] But if it's never played,
[1:38:02] but it was brought into this church.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:09] [Music]
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; And when it's played by a son of God,
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; when it's played by a master that knows
[1:38:17] how to pick it
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; and bring it to its full potential.
[1:38:22] [Music]
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; That's what God wants to do with each
[1:38:25] one of you. That's right.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Be a clay in the potter's hands.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Be one that can be molded and used for
[1:38:36] the master.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Let your life play music that is
[1:38:43] pleasing unto the Lord.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:57] true value.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Let's stand today.
[1:39:09] Let's just pray.
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:26] Father,
[1:39:28] Lord, we humble ourselves in your
[1:39:30] presence.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, I know when you come by and I can
[1:39:36] feel your presence, oh God,
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; I know when you begin to minister to
[1:39:40] hearts and we go in certain directions
[1:39:42] and
[1:39:44] but we know that there's a purpose and a
[1:39:47] reason, oh God.
[1:39:50] [Music]
[1:39:54] Father, how we just want to be used in
[1:39:57] your hands.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Father, you've placed us here on earth
[1:40:04] for a purpose.
[1:40:09] And there's value in each one of your
[1:40:11] children's
[1:40:13] that are here tonight. They may think
[1:40:15] that they don't have much value or
[1:40:17] there's not they don't have much worth,
[1:40:22] but oh God, I ask that you would go unto
[1:40:24] them and you would minister unto them,
[1:40:26] oh God, and show them the value and the
[1:40:28] price that you had to pay and that
[1:40:31] redemption, it didn't come cheap, but
[1:40:33] there was a sacrifice that you had to
[1:40:35] send your only begotten son to come and
[1:40:38] die on a cross for each one of us, oh
[1:40:40] God, that we might be able to have the
[1:40:42] shed blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:40:45] [Music]
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, how blessed we are that you've
[1:40:48] sent a prophet in this day. Lord, I'm so
[1:40:51] thankful that you've sent El Ezer my
[1:40:54] way. Oh God.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, I didn't find you. You found me.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that we could have done.
[1:41:05] It's not of works unless a man should
[1:41:07] boast.
[1:41:10] How humble it makes us feel, oh God,
[1:41:12] that you've chosen us
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; as sons and daughters of God.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, there's no big eyes and little
[1:41:19] U's, but Father, you use each one of us
[1:41:21] as you see fit.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, from the youngest to the oldest,
[1:41:26] oh God, I'm asking the special blessing
[1:41:29] upon him.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:41:33] [Music]
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Lord. May we be
[1:41:42] May we be and have a just weight and a
[1:41:44] just balance
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; because that is your delight, oh God.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. And so, Father, as you've come and
[1:41:54] you've ministered, oh God, I ask that
[1:41:56] you would find good ground
[1:42:00] that you would go with us this day, that
[1:42:02] we would be
[1:42:04] ones that would be witnesses
[1:42:08] that father people can identify that
[1:42:10] that's a Christian.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; That's a godly man. That's a godly son.
[1:42:17] There's something different about that
[1:42:18] man.
[1:42:21] Lord, we want to tell you that we love
[1:42:22] you and appreciate you for your
[1:42:24] goodness. How blessed we are. Be with
[1:42:27] your children as we go our separate
[1:42:28] ways. And Father, we just ask that you
[1:42:31] would bring us back again on Sunday. Oh
[1:42:33] God. We love you and appreciate you in
[1:42:37] Jesus name.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:44] Lord,
[1:42:46] you are
[1:42:50] so precious
[1:42:53] to me.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Is he precious?
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:42:59] you are
[1:43:02] so precious
[1:43:05] to me
[1:43:07] and I love
[1:43:12] you.
[1:43:13] Yes,
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; I love
[1:43:18] you
[1:43:20] because
[1:43:23] you first
[1:43:26] love.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that again.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Is he precious to you?
[1:43:32] And Lord,
[1:43:35] you are
[1:43:38] so preious
[1:43:41] to me.
[1:43:45] Lord,
[1:43:47] you are
[1:43:50] so precious
[1:43:54] to me.
[1:43:56] And I love
[1:44:00] you.
[1:44:02] Yes, I love
[1:44:06] you
[1:44:09] because
[1:44:12] you first
[1:44:14] [Music]
[1:44:15] love me.
[1:44:20] [Music]
[1:44:23] I put value on Wednesday night.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; It's a just Wednesday.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; With a just measure
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; and a just value.
[1:44:38] [Music]
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I tell you, there was some real
[1:44:42] powerful
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; nuggets.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Yes.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; some in the message are wanting an oimpy
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; shot.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; And you don't change your diet
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; and your way of living.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; And you want to go
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Hey, that was good.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; That was a very good analogy.
[1:45:14] Hey
[1:45:18] [Music]
[1:45:20] How that
[1:45:21] [Music]
[1:45:24] Rebecca said, "Ela Ezer,
[1:45:28] tell me what he likes."
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; What is pleasing,
[1:45:39] right?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Every tape that I listen to, I hear
[1:45:43] another portion. Amen.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Of what pleases him.
[1:45:48] [Music]
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Increase your faith
[1:46:01] to be greater than the inflation of the
[1:46:03] world.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because that faith
[1:46:10] is the monetary value
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; for the rapture.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Without it,
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:46:22] [Music]
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; I feel a just a sweet presence
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; strumming the chords of my heart.
[1:46:34] [Music]
[1:46:43] You won't need the love letter anymore
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; when you have the lover.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:03] How that that prophet said,
[1:47:06] [Music]
[1:47:08] "Oh Lord,
[1:47:10] when it's all over,
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; the battles are over,
[1:47:16] arms are stacked, and the Bibles are
[1:47:18] closed
[1:47:20] and we come up to your house."
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; That's what I desire.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:29] And maybe you see yourself having fallen
[1:47:32] a little short.
[1:47:34] That's good. That's why we come to
[1:47:36] church.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; We say, "Lord, let me have a just
[1:47:40] measure." Yes.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; And when you put your value
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; on the things where your treasure is,
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; your habits,
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; your career,
[1:47:57] your priorities, they change.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; They do.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; And it's not something that is a
[1:48:05] conscientious change. It just
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; happens. Yes, it does. You find out
[1:48:13] when
[1:48:16] Paul said when I was a child I thought I
[1:48:19] spoke I
[1:48:21] but when
[1:48:24] when I became a man that's right
[1:48:29] there's a a time when you actually grow
[1:48:32] up and you say you know what the value
[1:48:35] that I had on that
[1:48:39] that sport, that career, that job, that
[1:48:43] whatever.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; But when you mature to a place in him,
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; those values
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; are no longer
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; there. That's why coming to church is so
[1:48:58] important.
