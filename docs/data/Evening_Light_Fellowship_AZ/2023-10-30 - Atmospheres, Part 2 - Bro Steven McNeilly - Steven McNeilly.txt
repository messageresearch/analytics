those who are wward off the wrong track because he is the same yesterday today and forever amen you may be seated for a moment this morning God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen and uh we bring you greetings there from Elf Youth and Flagstaff and we just we had a really nice time we've we've been doing this annually where we'll uh brother Ron will rent us a cabin up there in Flagstaff and we all just get together for three or four days and and just en enjoy each other's company and um we did think things a little bit different this year and they're all streaming this morning so we say God bless you richly um we did something a little different this year we had some of the youth um the youth boys take the services and so we asked six or seven of the young men on Friday night we had brother Justice Wallace and he spoke on letting go of things and opening up more doors in our hearts and uh it was very very good brother brandham preaches this service uh doors in a door and he says within your heart there's many doors within your heart and unless you open those doors and make God welcome uh uh those he he talks about opening those doors up and saying father here's my issues come in and dwell and take care of these issues um so it was excellent Matthew Aon he spoke on it's never too late to rebuild and he took his scripture from from the book of Nehemiah there and it was just excellent everybody did an excellent job I could I could preach a sermon on each one of their thoughts of what they did and it was very interesting to see how that each one kind of dovetailed one with another uh brother Nicholas yeski he he gave his testimony he wanted to make sure that everybody knew that God moved him out here for a purpose and so then we had breakfast Saturday morning and then we had a little time of devotion Saturday around 10:00 and brother Elias pagee he spoke on change changing your habits and your morning routines um brother Jonathan McGary spoke after him he said ye are the light of the world go forth and Shine Your Light and um um there was a a quote that he used where brother brandham said that you are God's Billboards and so you know afterwards I asked the question I said what is your billboard showing this morning and um just everything was excellent and the last but not least was brother Emmanuel bya and he spoke on prayer and so we could we were just very very happy and very pleased and we are so proud of our youth group um it's very interest interesting I remember being in the youth group and um you know all these guys wanted to do not to mention any names Justin dubsky and they love all boys and you know uh all they wanted to do was play volleyball and and sports and stuff and and uh and that was fine um I would rather play soccer than volleyball but that was just me um but it's amazing to see the Dynamics how the youth group changes Friday night there was two of the boys uh brother Titus um Franklin and Michael you know Michael who comes and sings he's a relation to the bi so both of these boys are like Semi-Pro chess players and so here we are midnight Friday night and there's just I don't know 20 25 of the young people are gathered around just mesmerized watching these guys play chess and I thought this is amazing the volleyball net isn't even set up they're hardly even playing any sports and here we are mesmerized by a chess game and uh and so it's just it's just neat to see the change and and how the Dynamics change within a group but we are just so proud of them and their stand and their uh uh that they take for the Lord Jesus in this hour stand with me if you would thank you musicians turn with me in your Bible to the Book of Mark chapter 13 and we'll read verses 5 through 8 hallelujah amen verse 5 of chapter 13 it says and Jesus answering them began to say take heed lest any man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many and when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars be really scared and hide yourself in a closet that's not what it says it says be ye not troubled for such things must needs be but the end shall not be yet for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be earthquakes and in diverse places and there shall be famines and troubles these are the beginning of Sorrows amen let's pray together father we certainly love you and we are thankful for an another opportunity that we can come Lord and we can hear your word father for it's the desire of a Believer to hear your word it's a desire of the believer that your word would have an effect on our lives Lord and so I'm asking that you would come by sweetly this morning and speak to our hearts take the word multiply it Lord and feed our souls we ask you would meet the different needs within the assembly be with the youth and Flagstaff father father and as they drive down on the road there I pray that you would keep every one of them safe Lord we ask it for thy Kingdom's glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated this morning I would like to title my sermon this morning and continue on this thought on atmospheres this is atmospher part two and when we last spoke on this we spoke on the import of the atmosphere uh we spoke on the important of the atmosphere around the earth and that how that without the atmosphere around the earth just to put very plainly and very simply where the Earth would not be inhabitable it's it it protects us from the Sun it protects us from many different things in our galaxy and so without the right kind of atmosphere surrounding our Natural Earth it would be extremely bad for this planet and so we spoke on the same thing with our natural uh body as as a Believer and and our and our spiritual lives that it's extremely important for us to always remember to keep the right atmosphere around us not only to keep the right atmosphere around us as we are in church and as we are amongst one another uh fellowshipping with Believers but having the right atmosphere in our homes having the right atmosphere on our jobs having the right atmosphere with whoever it is that we come and contact with it is vitally important for us to remember to keep the right atmosphere because it is so easy so easy for us Believers to get into the wrong atmosphere and when we are in the wrong kind of atmosphere it produces the wrong kind of results but when we are um when we realize it and we and and we say father now at this moment cuz guess what it's going to happen there' be times in our day in our week in our months in the year that guess what but we are going to be in the wrong kind of atmosphere but the good thing is is that we don't have to stay in that wrong atmosphere but we can make a very a a very good choice and say father the atmosphere that's surrounding me right now is is not the greatest it's not producing very good results Lord here I am change my atmosphere because brother brandham said that the right kind of atmosphere produces the right kind of results amen so we realize that when a seed goes into the ground we know that in order for a seed to bring forth of its full potential that it has to have a a few things surrounding it it has to have the right kind of soil it has to have the right kind of water and moisture and it has to have enough sunlight in order for the seed to bring forth of the full potential that lays Within it now but if this seed is planted in the wrong kind of atmosphere we realize that it will never bring forth of its full potential of what lays within that seed now we can we can even though it has soil even though it has moisture and even though it's getting sunlight if the atmosphere is wrong it's not going to grow right for instance we can talk on the cactus here in Arizona and we realize that um the cactus here it it it does very well and it grows very well and it lives well here because the atmosphere around it is the right kind of Atmosphere for that seed to grow now if you were to take that same seed or or or a bush or some kind of shrub that grows well here in the desert and you go ahead and you put it in the High Country you put it in a place where it's really cold you put it in a place where it's where it gets a lot of moisture where it gets a lot of rain and these different things it'll never produce the same as it does as it as here in the valley why because the atmosphere is wrong even though it's planted in a in a soil even though it gets the sunlight even though it gets a little bit of moisture but too much of one thing it'll cause it not to grow correctly now think spiritual because God wants us to always he wants us to bring forth the full potential that lays within the seed that he's placed within our hearts but understand it's up to us to make sure that the atmosphere surrounding that seed is correct otherwise it'll never bring forth to its full potential oh it might bring forth a little bit bit it might bring forth the Bible says some 30 and some 60 whatever it is but we want to bring forth 100 fold you can take a tree up in the North Country there up in the cold up in the hills take the seed bring it down to the valley plant it I'm going to have a beautiful massive tree and this tree and the fall is going to lose its lose its leaves and it's going to be beautiful fall colors cuz we never get that in the desert ain't going to happen why because the atmosphere isn't right Hallelujah so we find out that God now placed the seed within the Earth and that certain seed is supposed to bring forth at a certain degreed time a certain season so a seed of God that was planted to come forth in smia would never come forth in laiaa and a seed of God that was to come forth in laiaa wouldn't come forth in another church age why because the atmosphere wasn't right though it's a seed though it's been planted in the ground but yet the atmosphere isn't the same for that seed to bring forth let me say this a seed in these other Church ages that that have went before us they wouldn't flourish like you flourish in this age and you say oh my I I feel like I'm a son or a daughter and I'm born out of due season no you're not you're born exactly at the right time that God wanted you to come here why because he has a purpose for you and for your life yeah you could have come forth when the horse and buggy and all that stuff and they were farmers and you know everything was great there's nobody chasing you off your land nobody trying to steal your crops because that's what we think isn't it everything in other days gone by it was just easy it was easy to make a living it was easy to grow a crop oh my I'm sure they had their struggles but if you were to come forth at that time you would never bring forth the fruit that you are now because it wasn't the right atmosphere for that seed to bring forth hallelujah what happens is with us we we find out that God has has a plan for us and he has a purpose for us and that purpose is is not for us to to live for ourselves it's not for us to be selfish and to think only of ourselves but it's for us to say father let thy will be done in this Earth as it is in heaven now in order to do that first off we've got to Humble ourselves because we all have desires we all have wants we all have places that we want to go and things that we want to do but before we choose those things we should be saying father what would you want me to do amen God knows everything about you he does brother brandham would say in his Services he would say God knows where you came from who you are he knew where you would be sitting and the Very clothes that you would be wearing right here today in this service now if God know knows all of those things don't you think that God knows the needs that's in our lives don't you think that God knows the things that we are in need of he's just wanting us to ask the problem is that when we ask we get impatient the problem is is that when we ask and it doesn't come to pass as we think it should come to pass guess what happens we get discouraged well God hasn't heard my prayer God God doesn't answer my prayer this hasn't come to pass why is this happening why am I going through this I've asked for deliverance whatever it may be why we get impatient and when we get impatient we get discouraged and when you get discouraged you want to quit God help us because God's ways are so much above our ways that's right I remember one time it just comes to my mind I was uh I don't know 12 years old and so when I grew up in Ireland we lived in in a in a in a it was like a council house or whatever and um it's kind of where the poor people live right and um all these detached houses and stuff and and it's taller than it is wide and everything and that's just how I grew up that's okay but when I when I come of age and I begin to realize it I thought my goodness my friends they they live in a bungalow and bung over there you live in a bungalow your mom and dad's doing pretty good and H you're probably more middle class and I remembered standing at my window every night my grandma lived right across the street from us and so every night I'd turn the light on and off on and off cuz I could see her through her window I could see her sitting watching TV and so I'd always wave at her I wave good night right and it just something me and my grandma did it was nice and um and so I remember standing there one time and I thought my goodness I I hate living in this house and this this thing and everything I want to live in a bungalow and I said it and I thought I thought I want to live in a bungalow it was the desire of my heart and I didn't know I was what I was doing I was just saying it probably more out of frustration and pride well what what happened in my life after that was from 14 through 16 got caught up in in in a bunch of stuff that I shouldn't have gotten caught up in with uh um and so I would have I would have people that would that would follow my school bus to my house I I went to school in a different town and these guys would be calling the other people on the bus we're going to get them we're going to get them and we're going to kill them I thought oh my goodness but I was too smart they could never catch me there's a time to fight and there's a time to to run man guess I had some wisdom when I was younger just like us there's a time to say something to somebody and there's a time just to keep her mouth shut wisdom father give us more wisdom so here here I was and and and things got so bad that we did the midnight move they'd be driving by our house and they'd be there's all sorts of bad stuff that was going on I was just a kid what happened was I got caught up with the wrong people got caught up with the wrong gangs got caught up with the wrong influences guys choose your friends wisely because if you choose the wrong kind of friends they'll take you to the wrong kind of places and then they'll bring that stuff around your house and nobody wants that and so we did the midnight move we moved to another town guess what kind of house we moved into a bungalow I say all that to say this I didn't know what I was asking for and sometimes we ask God for things in our lives and we ask God for a Deliverance or we ask God for patience or whatever it might be and next thing we know our lives get changed and get turned upside down and we think why is this happening because God has taken you to a place that you desired yeah but you think and you prayed for it and you look at it and you say this is not what I expected so we have to be careful sometimes and we have to realize that God knows he knows what he's doing he knows what he's going to do and he knows exactly where we are at we just have to be patient he amen a lot of times when we pray we think that God doesn't hear our prayers Revelation 5:8 says and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors what were these odors they were the prayer of the Saints understand in our carnal man and our and our in our flesh man in our emotions and our feelings and and all these different things that we see taste feel smell and hear that's what we uh that's what we judge our prayers off of if they've been answered or not well I I haven't seen anything things have actually gotten worse I I didn't feel anything it seems like disguise or brass and I can't pray through and I can't do this and this happens but yet there's a v that's full of odors of the prayer Saints what is it that's happening to us God and brother brother Ron has said it multitudes of times that God is weaning us away weaning us away from our emotions and Sensations and and our feelings and what we think and what we taste and see and he's weaning us away those things that we might walk by faith before God all we got to do is look at is look at Daniel in the Bible and and I stole this from Brother Danel this was so good when Daniel began to pray to God it seemed like the answer was always on its way when he would pray the answer was there and and that was him as a as a newborn babe in Christ but he got to a a place in his life where where he was troubled in his spirit and he was troubled within his mind and so he prayed to the same God but nothing changed he prayed to the same God but there was no answer he prayed to the same God and he was still troubled he was still caught up with with the with the with the his surroundings and the things that was troubling him until 21 days later there was an angel that came and visited with Daniel and what did the angel say to him your prayer was heard from the very first day from the very time that you spoke it that that prayer left the lips of your mouth God heard that prayer but there was a messenger of Satan that was sent and he hindered me but God hears your prayers and so it is with us we get so caught up with our emotions and Sensations and looking at our at the things that are surrounding us that we fail to remember that God hears and answers prayers it might not be how we expect it to be but the outcome Hallelujah the outcome will be right that's right amen thank you Lord amen sometimes we say father get a hold of our children I wonder if father God has to take our children sometimes and put them through the ringer once in a while for them to be completely on their back to realize there's only one place I can look and that's up amen God can take our friends away from us and let us in a big church feel like we are friendless I got no friends you got no friends and you're in a big church yeah sometimes God has to get us to a place like that for us to turn our eyes to him Hallelujah the Bible says that the fervent prayer of a righteous man it avails much the word Avail it means to be strong it means means to have force it means to Avail it means to be whole and as I as I read those those those meanings of ath I thought to myself to me the word Avail it means to have an impact it's strong it's forceful it it it avails it's whole it it's impactful so what is it when a when the prayer of a righteous man whenever he prays for a certain situation what is it it's forceful it has an impact on situations and that's why brother Brandon would say that Prayer Changes Things it has an impact on situations it has an impact on people's lives amen hallelujah God has not called us to walk by the things that we feel he has not called us to walk walk by our five sens the five Sensations within our within our bodies see tastes feel smell and hear they to contact our Earthly home guess what they're carnal amen and they're enmity with God but God now is through this message of the hour God is Not only calling us to walk by faith but God has called us to walk by A Perfect faith not just simple Faith but a faith that is perfect in all its ways listen to this perfect Faith 1963 brother brandham says this is coming into that third pool I'm believing it now I want to ask you a sincere question you that passed through the prayer line can you actually believe and feel now that something happened to you since his hands are laid on you he said there it is this is what we've waited for this is just starting to bloom now see I did this for a purpose I did this for I'm working out something see it's taking this charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in see to kind of raise faith in a bracket where you've never noticed it that way before now if you're to listen to the sermon brother brandham talks about perfect faith and he's relating it to the speaking of squirrels into existence he says uh not a faith but a perfect Faith he says build it up in here and watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect Promise by his perfect word which is sharper than any two- AED sword and a discerner of the thoughts of the heart we are coming now to the Perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the Rapture so now he's bringing us just from a simple Faith he said now it's going to take a perfect faith in order for the Rapture to happen he said that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured Faith what is the only thing that is holding the coming of the Lord right now where we live is because the church hasn't got to a place of perfect faith yet amen he says looking for it now how do we get this perfect faith it means a lot of Shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God Amen so now he's bringing us to a place of Perfection a place of maturity and he's saying uh uh how can we get to that place of perfection well let me let me just share something with you that you already know it's because the seals have been loosed off the book and now this book that was once closed to the people has now been opened before our wondering eyes and as we are partaking of this open book it is bringing us word by word line upon line precept upon precept from Faith to a perfect Faith but he said is going to take a shaving down first of all he puts himself in that category and then he says a shaving down for me and a shaving down for you amen I wonder what it is in our lives that we have to shave off what is it in our lives that brother brandom is talking about as going to take a shaving down as going to take a life of sincerity I I need to be more sincere with the word that God is giving me let me ask you the question because the answer is different for us as individuals what is it in your life and I ask myself the same question what is it in your life that needs shaved off what is it in your life that you could say you know what ah this thing I really I really don't need this thing right now it's kind of heavy it's a little tight I don't feel free in it should I take off my tie as well there's miles is like I'll leave it on Miles told me so but what is it in our lives in our natural lives that God is telling you and you know it that it needs shaved off it needs to be taken off you need to release it because guess what God will never take it from us but we have to take it ourselves and give it over take care of this for me I didn't even have to ask brother Robert he was right there that's how God is when you take a step towards God guess what God will take two steps towards you and you don't have to worry about where it goes I don't have to worry about my jacket anymore because brother Robert took care of it whenever you shave the things of the world off of Our Lives guess what we don't have to worry about it anymore we don't have to worry about where it goes we don't have to worry about anything about it why because God takes care of it Lord but there's no way brother Robert would come up and just try to take my jacket off of me it wouldn't be right it wouldn't be the right time to to do it God does the same thing with us he doesn't just come up and take this thing off of us and say you don't need this I'm going to take it from you no no no no God Waits until you're ready God Waits until it's your time until you say father I am sick and tired of this thing that that's got me all bound up and I'm I'm always struggling with it and all these different things father take it I need to preach without a jacket on in future feels good what has happened with the opening of this word God is making his will known onto us the will has been read by the executive did I pronounce that right to all the parties that have been involved in the death of the testator yes and understand that brother brandham he was the one that took this book who was announced by God he said hey you're the executive of this will now open it up and to everybody that's a partaker of this will to everybody who has their names that are written down within this book I want you to preach it to them I want you to preach what belongs to them I want I want you to tell them what is rightfully theirs because I put their name there hallelujah we're living too much below our privileges my brother and my sister and the reason is because we haven't been shaven off we haven't been loosing off the things that so easily besets us your name is in there that behold by my stripes ye are healed Hallelujah your name is in in there that if you cuz that's Faith but now watch the perfect Faith behold if you say to this mountain be removed and you don't doubt it in your heart it'll be done as thou Hast said your name is written there it's yours why because God placed it there praise the Lord I say father May Faith arise to a place of maturity to a place of we're not depending upon uh if we felt something or not no a perfect faith and a perfect God and knowing that God hears our prayers from the very time that we pray it from the very time that we speak it it's in those those vials those odors it's a sweet smelling Savor in the nostrils of God but he's wanting us to shave off that we might walk in maturity and in Perfection Hallelujah brother brandham said that we are all little creators and that we have the ability to change and to create the atmospheres around us follow with me in this sermon love and this is this is quite a a lengthy um quote here but just bear with me he says and if you'll learn to to love and to be kind to everybody and to be gentle he said have patience it'll even make your home life different so what is if we read what he's saying we could say if I learn to be gentle and have patience and to and to be kind to everybody in my household it'll make the home life a little different how easy it is for us to treat everybody else nice and gentle and kind but yet when it comes to our own families seems like we're just it's complete opposite father help us that's because they're family can choose can choose your friends but you can't choose your family you're stuck with me no matter how how bad I treat you but then we wonder why the the atmosphere in the home isn't where it should be guess what it starts somewhere and it starts with us as little creators and brother Brenham said if we'll be patient and kind to those around us it'll change the atmosphere he says it'll make your associations different God will honor you now I've tried it he's speaking by experience he said here some time ago in my home you can imagine what kind of a turmoil it's in all the time you just just think well the people say like here this little city what about the people from around the world see they're flying in coming in calling in all the time hotels motels sitting full of people crying and begging and you can't get a minute's rest what a life this man lived he said one day our house had been completely torn up all day long now I know none of your houses have ever been like that I know for sure my house has never been like that it's just with five kids it's never like that doesn't happen liar I just love how the prophet of God is so honest because in his honesty it is so relatable that I can say my goodness I've been there myself ashlin's probably like shut up Stephen be quiet listen to him the basement had been full every room full the den room full along about dark I got them kind of quiet anded down everybody away I thought and I went into the kitchen there stood my poor little wife at 37 years old I'm 35 years old few years older than me completely gray-headed holding her hands up crying she said Billy I'm just about to lose my mind understand she wasn't only trying to raise her little kids but she was dealing with all kinds of other people and Spirits within their home these children hasn't had a bite to eat all day long had some nervous people there in mental cases and some of them walking up and down the floor telling me that the Lord is going to strike me dead if I didn't go to a certain Town cuz they said so can you imagine and that's the kind you have to put it all together another one and another room saying oh oh he don't know what he's talking about I tell you if that was my house get out of my house you come here for help and you come here from prayer you come here to get healed and here you are saying all this stuff about me go stand outside but yet the prophet was so patient and so gentle and so kind with everybody that he came in contact with he set the bar so high uh another one oh he don't know what he's talking about I got thus sayith the Lord if the Lord wanted me to know anything he would tell me he's not afraid to talk to me but you have to put up with that sometime and she said I don't know what to do well look there sat Sarah and Becky Becky in the floor fussing over some little blocks little bitty building blocks Sarah screaming to the top of her voice daddy Becky's got my blocks daddy she took my pocketbook a while ago can you imagine and here was people coming for prayer and the kids are in turmoil all right Joseph sitting in the floor beating on something as hard as he could the little boy he was beating and he was screaming can you picture it in your mind to the top of his voice now you talk about home sweet home I didn't think about it but brother R this will lead right into questions and answers for the young couples after after service the atmosphere within the home amen well I looked around I thought now there's just one thing to do we've got to change this situation and I love how he goes about changing this situation because he doesn't go about changing with a paddle and whipping everybody and sending them to their room it doesn't fix everything so many and all through the night now those people there through the day so many and all through the night does disturb the children but I want to be with them a little while so I thought Lord now you help me he says in my heart let me I'm just letting down to talk to you from my bottom of my heart tonight now of some things that you don't have to tell everybody so I said Lord you help me now to get upon me the holy spirit in such a way that will change this situation so notice what he's doing he says so praying to myself I put my arm around my little wife and I said oh sweetheart I really feel sorry for you what did he start off by doing started off by prayer he started off realizing that before he could fix the situation and the atmosphere in the house he had to make sure that his heart and his Spirit was in the right place with the holy spirit because we can't fix anything when we have a wrong attitude ourselves and that goes for all aspects of life it goes beyond just the household and our family and our children it goes to situations in work situations in school people you meet at the grocery store whatever it may be it starts off by fixing ourselves before we can help somebody else in the situation around us she said Billy I don't believe I can hold out any longer she said oh I'm just going to Pieces Just look at this house I said yes that's right honey that's exactly right and I put my hand around you know and I said I know it sweetheart I thought Lord you quieten her and I said no that's true but you know honey the other day when I was in Louisville I seen one of those pretty little he and he talks about what is that thing it's called a blouse he says I saw one of those pretty ones someplace where was it uh she said but Billy no time to talk about blouses she didn't realize what he was doing he was sensitizing her spirit we got no time to talk about blouses I kept my hand on her now honey I tell you you never seen such a pretty blouse I said look I tell you what Let's do let's get supper right quick and when we go I'll take you and show it to you I'll buy it for you oh she said that's nice of you Billy I couldn't look at a blouse tonight just look at me no doubt she hadn't a time to do her ha no doubt she was still in in in in with her apron on and and and she had so much to do because that's how women think guys we think let's go get something to eat let's just go girls think no we got to do the dishes we got to clean up the house we got to organize this and before you know it it's bad time we just think differently I think sometimes girls should just think like us it's a lot easier let's just go the time is now you better strike while irons hop before I change my mind so follow along with me here cuz this is a great lesson for us to learn and I know you all know the quote and I know you've all heard it preach before and I know you you've all read it and heard brother brandham say it but it's good for us to be remembered of these things let's get dinner right quick and I'll take it and I'll show and I'll even buy it for he say oh honey just look at me but look honey oh if you just see it I believe that you'd want to buy it Lord quieten her see he's putting his hand he's putting his hand on her I said I tell you what you put on me your apron let me help you get supper and so everybody thanks all the women are like praise God you see if you would just put on an apron once in a while and help with supper and do the dishes it would change the situations it helps but it started off by the prayer it started off by getting himself right and then he went from there and he's putting his hand on her shoulder and all the time he's taking control of that spirit that has her all riled up he's saying Lord quieten her and all the time he's talking in his heart he's saying quiet her little Spirit Lord and while her spirit is being quietened now he's talking to her about something that she enjoys and all of a sudden now we're going to see that the atmosphere is beginning to change it wasn't the apron that changed the atmosphere spere no doubt he would have gotten brownie points for it but it started long before that amen he said let me help you get supper so I put this apron on you know and begin to chop up some carrots and things you know and going on I I'll just interject this I was helping with breakfast yesterday morning and that big old big old pot of gravy and uh and Ashlin said okay stir that thing I said okay I'll stir it and I'm stirring it and stirring it and and Anthony roess comes over to me and he says Hey brother stevenh I said yeah what's up he goes you don't cook a lot do you come on no why he goes I can tell by how you're stirring that [Laughter] gravy oh bless his heart the carrots and things you know going on once in a while she begin to quit crying I thought thank you Lord and I said oh honey Isn't the Lord wonderful he's just so good kept talking to her changing that atmosphere laying my hand on her as soon as I got her quiet after a while she was all smiles she said well Billy you think the stores would be open I'm pretty sure they will be I think they will be I thought thank you Lord it's working are we all taking notes here and this isn't just for the man whenever whenever our kids or our wives or whoever it may be when we see that the atmosphere is not right around us you have to do your part to get the guy softened up if you're at work and you see that someone's having a hard day and they reply with a with a sharp comment with you it's not the right time to reply to them with a sharp comment cuz there's something wrong there's something wrong with their atmosphere tried putting your hand on their shoulder and saying father before I say something they quiet in this guy's spirit and before you know before you know it and you talk to him and you say what's going on chances are they'll say man I had a bad day I had a rough night my kids this that somebody sick whatever it might be and then you realize now your spirit is soft and their spirit is soft and it takes away all the animosity so it's not just for the home life between Mom and Dad this takes care of our whole lives of everybody that we come in contact with amen I thought thank you Lord it's working so he just kept on and the first thing you know Sarah and Becky divided up their blocks in other words they started sharing and Joseph got him a little rattler and there was more peace in the home see now the only thing you have to change the situation if that can be done in the home it can be done in a church and the church said it can be done in a nation it could be done in the whole world it's the atmosphere that counts the natural way to hatch an egg is put it under the hand because she keeps it warm but put it under the same kind of a heat and it'll hatch anyhow it's the atmosphere that counts that's right so it's the atmosphere and you make up that atmosphere with what you are inside of you now what are these what are these lessons that we can learn from this it's not to act harshly in situations and if we feel that we're going to ask God God softened my heart before I try to fix this situation and then let God do it because too much of the time we enter it with the wrong atmosphere and everything blows up which ain't good for nobody ain't good for our families it ain't good for our church and ain't good for our nation amen now we can see that the atmosphere in the world isang changing extremely rapidly we found we found in our opening scripture that there be Wars and there's rumors of wars we see that not only is there rumors of wars but there's more Wars and then there's rumors of more Wars and then there's more Wars it seems like since since I can remember there's more Wars Happening Now amongst all over the world than there has ever been and you can feel it in the atmosphere you can sense the atmosphere of peace is starting to change the atmosphere of safety within a nation is starting to change we think well that's just in Israel well I beg to differ you see these guys out here protesting and stuff you think they're they they they love American society and and you got to be kidding me it's changing times are changing and the atmospheres are changing men's hearts are failing for fear we see that people on I'm reading scripture here we see that people are he they're highminded they're lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God we see that there there's no morals within people's lives anymore we see that the governments are corrupt the countries around the world everything is just a ball of absolute corruption and it's all because of the wrong atmosphere that is surrounding us as people we see that there's earthquakes in diverse places we see that there's famines there's floods and we could go on and on with the list of of of of signs of the end times that we are now living in brother brandham said that it was 3 Minutes to Midnight I looked up the Doomsday Clock the other day and it said it's 90 Seconds To Midnight the whole world is declaring that there's something happening amongst us that this world is going to end the whole world is starting to notice the signs of the times they're starting to re recognize the day that they are living in but the problem is they are failing to recognize the message that they are living in brother Brenham said recognizing your day and it in other words recognizing your day and the anointed word that's supposed to be fulfilled for this day a lot of times I've been thinking about it a lot whenever we talk about when we say the message we we put it in a category of a man and we say the message and the message well and we and we label brother brandom with the message but really what the message is is the Vindicated word it is Anointed by God to be fulfilled for this day not for another day not for another age going by but the day in which we are living in amen it is God's word it is God's word that is being f fulfilled but we say well we're a message believer when I'm a I'm an anointed word believer I would kind of rather say that at this point sometimes because that's really what it is it has nothing to do with a man though man was the was is something that God uses but yet it's so hard for people not to get our eyes upon the man the world is in a Sodom condition man leaving the natural use of the woman burning in their lust one for another Bible says as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be the Bible says as it was in the days of lot so shall it be people are realizing you could go on to YouTube people get on there and they'll say prophecy for fulfilled Israel is in our homeland prophecy fulfilled Israel's at War prophecy fulfilled and they're seeing all these prophecies fulfilled they're seeing the signs of the end times but understand seeing the signs Hallelujah seeing the sign of the end time will not change you as a Believer because the signs of the end times brings a fear upon the people but when the fear leaves guess what happens that sincerity that was once there causing people to get in line with God leaves they go back to what they were before why because it's an emotional thing it's fear and it's not by faith outside of the anointed word of the hour there's nothing that can hold us there's nothing that can keep us you can see the signs you can know about Israel you can know about these different things but when you see the word Vindicated that's what holds us that's what protects us and that's what gives us overcoming power it's not just knowing about what's going on around us cuz that's a fearful thing but when the fear leaves what happens everybody goes right back to what they were before just look at the war in Russia you guys all remember when Russia first invaded Ukraine and the whole world was thinking my goodness I didn't think they were going to do it and everybody in the message is saying watch Russia King of the North watch Russia oh my there was people started coming back to church because they were fearful of the signs of the times but now that it's went on 3 90 days whatever it is I don't know something like that who even talks about the war in Russia now I don't see it on my Apple news I don't really see it coming up in my news suggestions why because now there's something else going on but yet so the people that perhaps went back to church and serving God because of fear of King of the North now that that's kind of uh not passed but the fear has subsided I want to ask you how was their walk with God now chances are it's back to the same old way that it used to be why because there's no fear that's driving them the bride of Christ is not drove by fear she's drove by love amen we love him because he first loved us and that's what keeps us in line is our love for him yes Lord hallelujah we've seen I've mentioned all these different signs that's all around us but yet and I think the timing is almost like impeccable of the little series that brother Ron is going on the revealing of the son of man and though for some it might seem like we know these things and we've heard these things for years and and and and and on and on and and and and yes praise the Lord but I think the timing is impeccable because it's bringing us back into a remembrance that the signs of the day is not what is getting the bride of Christ ready it is the revealing of the son of man an open word book is what is getting us ready and so it's putting our eyes and our faith back into remembrance of this stuff out here is not changing me it's the word that changes me and so if the word changes me I want to get into the word I want to partake of the word because the word became flesh that the flesh man might become word we can look at many of you remember Camala Harris when she was first voted in as vice president and here she was dressed and robed in purple and everybody wow it's a fulfillment of scripture and she's dressed in purple and here she is she's going to be in a uh uh the vice president and if something happens to the vice pres to the president she's in and all this stuff and it was a big deal amongst message Believers but now what have any of us mentioned our vice president Kamala Harris's name in the last week no because she's hiding and not doing anything I shouldn't have said that I'm sorry truth is truth huh we were all caught up with it but now the time has went on guess what it's not a big deal anymore and so now those who were being pressed by fear of this end time prophecy of a woman in charge and now that it's not coming to pass as we first thought thought it would of her being president and running the show guess what we all get back in our complacency oh yeah well I guess that's another one it wasn't the right time well yeah praise the Lord praise the Lord I'll just go back and and I'll stop shaving off the things of the world because the time is not right yet understand brother Brenham said and I'll give you the quote thus saith the Lord you're receiving your last sign we received our last sign in the 1960s it doesn't matter what else happens here now notice the sign is sent for the bride the sign is not sent for denominational world worldism it's not sent for those people out there but it's sent for the bride to prepare her to get ready amen how many of you have been watching the war in Israel right now it's a fearful thing things are escalating extremely quickly what's so interesting to me is is not necessarily the the war in Israel and though it's bad and people are losing their lives and and it should never have happened the scary thing for me is the protests that are going on around the world kill the Jews gas the Jews they're closing down cities and London and all all these different places here even in our in in ASU brother Zach huh he told me the other day he he's standing there with this Israeli flag and there's all these other uh Palestinian people and they're saying free Palestine kill the Jews cast them out kill them they're the occupiers but yet they can protest and get away with it I want to ask you what kind of spirit is that that's driving in these people to where they can get behind a terrorist organization that killed innocent people if you want to kill the Jews hey go for their army base innocent people didn't do anything but yet now that tree free that pre-tribulation spirit is still alive today because Spirits never die and guess what they're getting away with it because the old the whole world is agreeing with Palestine there's just a Chosen Few that are staying strong with Israel but you already see it within our own country people starting to turn against Israel what happens when we turn against Israel as a country we're doomed amen it can happen quicker than what we think so then you see Iran how much money has the US sent to Iran billions of dollars yeah here's money go buy Rockets go buy all this stuff what do you think's going to happen so now they give it to the terrorists Hamas Hezbollah all these different things who's real tight with Iran Russia watch Russia King of the North Ezekiel 38 things are transpiring says he'll come in from the north where's Iran where's the Iranian border with Israel it's on the northern border what time are we living in if the word isn't changing you hopefully this will we're right there further brandom said there's only one thing that's holding this whole thing up and that's the Bride of Jesus Christ it's just interesting and I'm just talking from my heart about that whole situation it's just it's really really interesting how the chest pieces are all starting to move it's all start everybody's starting to get into their place and let me just ask the question what's the pope doing right now I don't know I haven't seen anything he's the one we need to be watching for is he going to come in with to try and cause peace and have a union with Israel and are we going to I don't know but he's too quiet for his own good he's hiding something he is they're getting ready to move a bunch of Pawns I tell you what the queen she's about ready to go up yes sir thank you Lord all these things are the signs of the times but we the bride we have received our last sign and it's the voice behind the sign that is quickening our hearts to prepare us for his soon coming 1965 this day the scriptures fulfilled and we have not one other type I have I have to type scriptures because I don't have an education enough to bring the words and things I make it type but if I see the shadow if I never see my hand and see the shadow I know I had five fingers and that's the way you have to watch the scripture in the Old Testament what does it do it foreshadow is this and Jesus said that Sodom was the foreshadow of the end time now and the Very scriptures that was promised to Sodom the very scriptures that was taking place at Sodom that Jesus said would repeat itself again in this day it's made known right before us today he says God bless you don't miss it whatever you do don't miss it and if I don't see you here here next year when they climb the golden stairs I hope to meet you up there God bless you what was happening at this time of the time of Sodom and Gomorrah we can just look at their their their their their their natural country and we realize that they were in a state of sin they were in a state of where they got uh remember the kings that rose up against them and and took all their women and took lot and everything like that they were at a time of War there was a time where sin was in abundance where the sodomites kind of like ruled the ruled the place there was no rules whatever could be whatever they thought could be done it was done and we look at this sign but forget to realize that there was something else that was going on at that time Abraham was meeting with Elohim let Sodom be Sodom we are not part of Sodom we're not part of louia anymore but we're in the bride age yes sir so what was happening with the bride up there I love this notice Abraham and Sarah did not go looking for God but God came to them Hallelujah Abraham wasn't out there searching and saying oh God I want to talk to you no no no no no he came to Abraham he came to their tent he came to their dwelling place because he wants to have intimate Fellowship praise the Lord he said oh my Lord Elohim he recognized him the voice of God guess what the bride recognizes it I'll stay a little while let me fetch the the this CF he's tender he's going to taste good let me let me make some butter let me let me do the let me serve you Lord let me serve you it's not what God can do for us but it's what we can do for God cuz he's already done everything for us amen prise the Lord it was their Dwelling Place he came to them when they weren't looking for him why because it was time all of us have a time that we meet with God and I pray that we just don't go back to one time in our lives but we say father meet me again and again and again and again because once isn't good enough so he had fellowship with Abraham he had fellowship with Sarah and they had communion one with another what was he doing he was breaking the word to them any Wonder this third pole Ministry has to do with a tent it's a dwelling place it's no longer in the outer courts it's not even on the inner courts but as in the whole holiest of holies and that's where he meets the believer in that little room where the room in your heart what does he do when he meets Us in there he has communion he breaks the word we eat with him we sck with him and he reveals to us this open Word Book why was he doing that because it was time for the promise to be fulfilled it was time for them to receive their body change because in the state that they were in guess what they could never bring forth the promised son Isaac would never have come forth unless they were changed so it is with us unless we start shaving off unless we get into that perfect faith of perfect rapturing Faith he's not going to come so he's waiting for us to get in our position to shave the things off of the world that he might come and receive them on receive us onto himself so what did he do he said I'm going to visit with youall and here was Sarah in the tent me an old woman ah I don't think so you know when I thought about it today you know I don't believe Sarah was being arrogant because the bride of Christ is not arrogant I just believe she was being truthful and said oh me I'm an old woman how can I have pleasure with my Lord how is this even possible so then he calls her out and he discerns the thoughts that was within our heart brother brandham said you're receiving your last sign understand as it was was in that day before Sodom was burned up with fire the son of man was revealing the word Discerning the hearts of the people as that was the last sign before Sodom was burned up now brother brandham is tying it together and he's saying this is your last sign not Israel being at War that's where the church not sodomites and all these different things and and and and and and and countries corrupt and and Satan having his way everywhere he goes no no no no no that's for the church that's not for the bride so take your eyes take your eyes off what is sent to the church and keep your eyes on what is sent to the bride because he said I know longer call you uh servant I call you friend he said I no longer call you church I'm called calling you bride so when he's speaking to the bride we should be listening stop paying attention to what is sent to get to the attention of the church and put your attention and set yourself on the wings of a dove and Fly Above All this nonsense it'll free you up it'll make you happier it'll make your faith into a perfect Faith ready for a rest Rapture amen help us Lord notice this spiritual Amia 1964 I want to ask you something what if he does come tonight if the musicians would come oh say he isn't coming I don't know whether he is or not he said this is the last sign remember thus sayeth the Lord whenever he says thus sayeth the Lord that's God Almighty speaking you know what's interesting about the testimony of B Billy Paul whenever he shares it not one time does he ever say thus sayith the lord it's on YouTube you can listen to his testimony when he talks about it interesting isn't it you are seeing your last sign he said that scriptural you've seen your last sign Pentecost don't get mixed up now with what he promised Israel after the Rapture that ain't you you were done then see now is your day now is your sign notice this is your day and this is your sign not the sign to the world but right here amen now is your time don't reject it don't do it you'd better come you believe me to be God's servant [Music] remember say brother Stephen we know these things yeah it's good for your remembrance how easy it is for us as bride material to get caught up with the stuff that is sent to the church that's right with the stuff that is sent to loua and we forget that this is our last sign there's no other sign that's given to the bride we've had it for years upon years so now the question is this what are we as individuals doing with it because we can preach about it and you can understand it and you can say yep I agree that that is 100% the truth but if you don't do anything about it if you don't take it into your heart and say Lord this is so true I've been caught up with the church that I have forgotten that as the bride we have our last sign and now I'm clothing myself I'm shaving myself of the things of the world and now I'm clothing myself in your word of righteousness because when he comes he's going to take one thing with him and that's his word amen the word is coming for the word the word is not coming for you as a flesh person cuz your flesh is going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye but when the word comes he onlyi recognizes one thing and that's the word and so now it's up to us as Believers to take the word clothe yourself with it eat it and become the word cuz when we become the word guess what happens when he comes will he find Faith absolutely how is he going to find Faith cuz I am the word I am the manifestation of this open book and so when he comes he's only going to see me so be encouraged don't be downtrodden don't be fearful of the things that's coming upon the Earth cuz it's only going to get worse put your hope and trust in God alone and in the word God bless you give the Lord a hand clap and this morning Hallelujah God bless you s my stand together to receive I [Music] want for me my inheritance I wanted Jesus all that's true for me open my
