[13:23] things, for all the praise reports, for
[13:25] everything that was pinned down, Father,
[13:27] knowing that you'll pay attention, Lord,

[23:57] Um, camping trip. um went out on the
[24:01] camping trip with the some of the guys
[24:03] and the suns and uh Friday um it was
[24:07] warm in the morning and all the kids
[24:09] were out playing and then some uh
[24:11] rainclouds blew in and it got cooled
[24:13] down quite a bit. Next thing we know the
[24:15] kids are all screaming snake snake. Um
[24:18] they had found a little rattlesnake
[24:19] crawled up in the bush and they were
[24:21] playing like within a foot or two from
[24:23] it and I think it was just the cold. We
[24:26] kind of figured out that the cold had
[24:27] caused it to curl up and not move at all
[24:29] so that way the kids it wouldn't have
[24:31] bothered the kids. So, we're able to get
[24:33] it taken care of and no one got hurt,
[24:35] but wanted to they were literally all
[24:37] over there. We're 100 ft or so away and
[24:40] wouldn't have known it. So, want to
[24:42] thank the Lord for that.
[24:45] Um, and then the song isn't anything
[24:48] anything crazy, but um, I turned it on
[24:51] this morning and then when I was reading
[24:54] um, Psalm 66, make a joyful noise unto
[24:56] the Lord all ye lands and sing forth the
[24:59] honor of his name. Make his praise
[25:01] glorious. So, it's all I want to do is
[25:04] just praise the Lord. Feel free to sing
[25:07] with, but I wanted to sing it this
[25:09] morning.
[25:12] [Music]
[25:15] We are a
[25:18] moment. You are
[25:23] forever. Lord of the
[25:28] ages, God before
[25:32] time. We are a
[25:37] vapor. You are eternal.

[30:25] I'm humbled by the thought of being

[30:53] pay for all the shame of who I was. It

[32:02] of your blood. I'm so unworthy of the

[32:16] still floods my mind that I'm not
[32:18] enough.
[32:20] But I'm so thankful that you loved me
[32:26] anyway. Oh, I'm unworthy,
[32:33] Lord. I feel so unworthy,

[32:47] unworthy of your blood. I'm so unworthy
[32:52] of the price you
[32:55] had to
[32:57] pay. For all the shame of who I was,

[33:05] enough. But I'm so thankful that you
[33:09] loved me anyway.
[33:13] Lord, when you could have walked away,
[33:17] you loved me

[44:02] be a Christian. Thank you, Lord. And it
[44:04] is not a new organization.
[44:08] It's not a religion,
[44:11] but it's a personal relationship with

[44:41] welcome back Brother Ron, Sister Sandy.
[44:45] Amen. So, I got a last minute
[44:49] call for to preach the gospel. Usually,
[44:54] I I told brother Ron that he request me
[44:58] to preach at least two weeks in
[45:01] preparations because I have the hard
[45:03] time translating it.

[46:57] you uh a hundfold times. Amen. Amen. And
[47:02] so praise the Lord. Amen. Let's bow our
[47:06] head. Most gracious heavenly father,
[47:09] Lord, we are so privileged to be in your
[47:10] house this morning. We give you the
[47:13] praise. We give you the honor. We give
[47:15] you the thanksgiving, Lord. And we thank

[47:54] me, Lord, to deliver the word that you

[47:58] may not see a man, but they will see
[48:01] you, Lord, in the revealed word of the
[48:04] hour.
[48:05] So I commit this service to you Lord in
[48:07] Jesus Christ's name and amen and amen.
[48:11] So I invite you to open uh our
[48:16] scripture in second Peter 3 verse
[48:23] 1-5 then Romans 10 verse 20-
[48:29] 21. Amen.
[48:38] So just say amen when you'll get there.
[48:40] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Second
[48:43] Peter chapter 3 verse 1. This second
[48:47] epistle beloved I now write unto you in
[48:51] both which I steer up your pure mind by
[48:54] way of remembrance.
[48:57] So we need to keep steering our mind by
[49:00] way of remembrance of the things that we
[49:02] have been taught in this hour. Amen. So
[49:06] steer up means to we need to be
[49:08] inspired.
[49:09] We need to stimulate.
[49:12] We need to awaken.
[49:14] Amen.
[49:15] Let us not uh be a lukewarmian age.
[49:20] That's right. That's always on fire.
[49:23] Amen.
[49:25] Verse two. So that he may be mindful of
[49:28] the words which were spoken before by
[49:31] the holy prophets and of the commandment
[49:34] of us the apostle of the Lord and
[49:37] Savior. Knowing this first that there
[49:41] shall come in the last days covers
[49:43] walking after their own lust. And saying
[49:47] where is the promise of his coming?
[49:49] Yeah. For since the fathers fell asleep,
[49:52] all things continue as they were from
[49:54] the beginning of the creation.
[49:58] For this they willingly are ignorant of
[50:02] that by the word of God the heavens were
[50:04] of old and the earth standing out of the
[50:07] water and in the
[50:10] water. in Romans chapter 10 verse 20
[50:20] 21. Thank you
[50:27] Lord. Verse 20. Isaiah is very bold. So
[50:32] Isaiah is the prophet Isaiah. Amen. And
[50:37] said I was found of them that sought me
[50:39] not. and I was made manifest unto them
[50:42] that ask not after me. So this is
[50:45] speaking of future time when the
[50:48] Gentiles would receive the message of
[50:50] Christ gladly after the Jew as a nation
[50:53] had rejected the message of Christ for
[50:55] their day. In verse 21, but to Israel he
[51:00] said all day long have I stretched forth
[51:02] my hands unto a
[51:05] disobedient and gains people.
[51:09] So as the Jew rejected the message of
[51:13] Christ and refused to come out of the
[51:15] denominations in their day, the message
[51:18] of that day was given to the Gentiles.
[51:21] Amen. Amen. So we embrace the message of
[51:26] the hour even in these last days that
[51:28] the word is being restored among us. So
[51:31] as the prophets said as they reject the
[51:33] message of the hour in these last days
[51:35] and we receive it by grace now this
[51:38] message will return back to them.
[51:42] And it's already on the way. Amen. Amen.
[51:45] So we can also see the sign. So may the
[51:47] Lord add the blessing upon the reading
[51:49] of his word. You may now be seated. So I
[51:52] will uh title this little thought the
[51:56] sign of the end
[51:58] time. And the subject the rise of
[52:03] scoffers a disobedient and gains people.
[52:08] Amen.
[52:10] So I would like to focus on second Peter
[52:13] verse chapter
[52:15] 3:3. Knowing this first that there shall
[52:18] come in the last days scoffers walking
[52:21] in their own lust.
[52:24] So we are now in the last days. Yes.
[52:28] Scappers are individual who mock and
[52:31] ridicule or express contempt for God his
[52:35] word and his people. Those who oppose or
[52:38] belittle the teaching of God. And we can
[52:41] see it in our day. You can see it in
[52:45] YouTube. Anywhere you go, there is
[52:46] always a sculper that is against the
[52:49] message of the hour. Amen. So that's why
[52:52] we will not wonder why they come out. in
[52:56] these generations while they mock the
[52:59] prophet while they mock the message
[53:00] while they against the prophet against
[53:02] the prophecy. So it's not already an
[53:06] ordinary thing. We will not be surprised
[53:09] because this is the sign of the last
[53:12] days. So we need to rejoice that they
[53:14] come out. In other words, this is a sign
[53:16] for us to stir up the things that we
[53:19] have already heard. Amen. They may
[53:22] against it but we are convinced by the
[53:24] passage of the hour. Amen. And no one
[53:27] can convince us. Amen. If even if they
[53:30] form a certain group to go against the
[53:32] message against the people of the
[53:34] prophet, but there is still a certain
[53:36] people of God who receive it by his
[53:39] grace and will stand irregardless of
[53:42] ridicule or scuffing they will do.
[53:45] Praise God. and saying where is the
[53:48] promise of his
[53:50] coming? This is one of the first real
[53:53] sign that we are closing in for the
[53:56] final stages of the rapturing of the
[54:00] bride the final stages. They are always
[54:04] asking where's the coming? Where is the
[54:05] coming? Yeah,
[54:08] remember that we preach about brother
[54:10] Brandham preached about the three coming
[54:11] of Christ. The first coming is to catch
[54:15] his bride, to redeem his bride. And the
[54:18] second coming, he come to catch the
[54:21] bride. And this second coming, we can
[54:24] see all supported by all the scriptures
[54:28] as we preached in last services. He said
[54:31] to to to John, "Behold, I come as a
[54:35] thief." He didn't say, "I come a thief,"
[54:38] but as a thief. Amen. Because a thief
[54:41] always strike silently and no one knows
[54:44] that is a secret coming of Christ. So
[54:47] this secret coming of second coming of
[54:49] Christ, he will not come in his corporal
[54:51] body but he will come according
[54:54] to the prophecy of Luke 17:30 as the son
[54:58] of man.
[54:59] So that's why this is a secret coming
[55:02] only for the bride of Jesus Christ. And
[55:04] we are fully convinced that we have
[55:06] received the message of the hour because
[55:09] when he come he fulfilled 1
[55:11] Thessalonians
[55:13] 4:17 as the Lord descended from heaven
[55:16] he will be a do three things there will
[55:19] be a shout there will be a voice and
[55:21] there will be a trump and we are already
[55:24] on the process of the changing of body
[55:28] because we already heard the voice we
[55:31] have already heard the shout the message
[55:33] of the hour. And the prophecy that there
[55:36] is now an invisible union between the
[55:39] bride and the bridegroom and the
[55:41] marriage of the bridegroom take effect
[55:43] in these last days.
[55:45] And he will take us out from here.
[55:49] Just like the brother brand said, just
[55:51] like Romeo and Juliet. Amen. And no one
[55:55] knows. But the sculpers says that where
[55:58] is his coming?
[56:01] Where is the promise of his coming? So
[56:04] notice this is not speaking about
[56:06] unbelievers questioning the message of
[56:09] the
[56:11] hour. Unbelievers don't even believe the
[56:16] message. Oh, the
[56:19] prophet. So these are message believer
[56:23] so-called that once were associated with
[56:26] the message. Yes. but who are now
[56:29] questioning and doubting and promoting
[56:33] question against the message of the
[56:36] hour. Amen.
[56:40] Can we see that all around us?
[56:44] It sure need to excite us because we are
[56:48] now in the final stages.
[56:51] Amen. Of the rapture of the bride. Thank
[56:54] you, Lord.
[56:56] They didn't appear few years back. They
[56:59] just appeared just few years.
[57:05] Amen. And look at their weak
[57:09] argument. For since the father fell
[57:11] asleep, all things continue as they were
[57:14] from the beginning of the creation.
[57:18] This is the excuse that they think
[57:20] justified their argument in that they
[57:24] say that prophecies of the prophet
[57:26] especially the gentile prophet in this
[57:28] generation
[57:30] have failed to come to pass according to
[57:33] their interpretation. Just like for
[57:35] example the prophet predicted 1977 God
[57:40] will come and they make an issue out of
[57:46] it. But for us we clearly understand
[57:49] that the prophet said I predict not
[57:52] prophesy.
[57:54] So they failed to come to pass according
[57:58] to their interpretation.
[58:00] For this they willingly are ignorant of.
[58:04] So they are not willing to search it
[58:06] deeper. That's right.
[58:09] In the revelation of what has God sent
[58:11] in these last days to learn about the
[58:13] coming of Christ in this hour. They are
[58:16] just simple message. They said oh
[58:19] there's nothing good to it. Just so
[58:22] simple message. There's a prophet. There
[58:24] is a church ages seal book. standard
[58:26] that's also
[58:31] simple. So the scripture
[58:34] said that by the word of God the heavens
[58:37] were old and the earth is standing out
[58:39] of the
[58:42] water. So willingly ignorant because
[58:45] they don't dig deep enough
[58:49] to know what is really the message of
[58:51] the hour. Amen.
[58:53] Because the prophet said if you want to
[58:55] go deeper into the love of God keep on
[58:58] digging and more will unfold. We have an
[59:03] open book. So the revelation is still
[59:05] continue. We don't put period in it.
[59:09] Because when you put period you become
[59:12] another denomination.
[59:14] Denomination of parroia denomination of
[59:16] tuso denominations of the return
[59:19] ministry. Yeah. We don't put period in
[59:22] it but we put comma in it because God is
[59:26] eternal. He keep on unfolding and
[59:28] unfolding. Remember that the book was
[59:30] open. Revelation 10:1 open book. Yes
[59:34] sir.
[59:36] It didn't close.
[59:38] It remains open. So sometime if we if we
[59:43] if if we quot some scripture that the
[59:46] prophet didn't mention remember that the
[59:49] book is still open.
[59:51] He keep on unfolding and unfolding. So
[59:54] may sometimes may we sometime may we use
[59:57] scripture that the prophet didn't use.
[1:00:00] But it doesn't mean that we are not in
[1:00:03] the message. That's right. Come on. And
[1:00:05] sometime they say oh the pro the the
[1:00:08] prophet didn't use that scripture
[1:00:11] but God if God open the scripture to us
[1:00:14] and it all against uh it point back to
[1:00:18] the word. Yeah, the word is open book.
[1:00:23] We have an open book that the revelation
[1:00:26] continues and continue and speaking
[1:00:28] about the the the the coming of
[1:00:32] Christ as the prophet said. Now remember
[1:00:35] I've said everything in three. His
[1:00:37] coming is in three. The first time he
[1:00:38] came to redeem his bride.
[1:00:43] And it happened when God was born in a
[1:00:47] manger became man sacrifice himself in
[1:00:51] Calvary. That his first coming to redeem
[1:00:54] his bride. The second time he want he
[1:00:57] come to catch away his
[1:01:01] bride. And many even the denominational
[1:01:05] people miss this the second coming which
[1:01:07] is the secret coming.
[1:01:13] like the love affair comes around and
[1:01:15] steal her out of nighttime and take her
[1:01:18] away from the word. Meet him in the air.
[1:01:20] So he's quoting 1 Thessalonian
[1:01:25] 4:17. Meet him in the air. The secret
[1:01:27] coming of the Lord. The second time he
[1:01:29] comes to receive his bride. First time
[1:01:30] to redeem her. The second time to
[1:01:32] receive her. And the third time with her
[1:01:36] as king and queen.
[1:01:38] Hallelujah.
[1:01:40] So that's why so if a person was to look
[1:01:43] for a public display of this great event
[1:01:46] of second coming as a tip in the
[1:01:50] ninth then you would never see it
[1:01:53] because a thief does not make a sin.
[1:01:56] That's right and announce his coming
[1:01:59] right that's why it is called secret.
[1:02:02] That's why he said that I will come as a
[1:02:05] thief. It's a secret coming and only the
[1:02:08] bride recognized his coming because he
[1:02:12] said his shout voice message in the last
[1:02:16] days and the bride embrace it.
[1:02:20] And the marriage took
[1:02:22] place when you receive the word of God
[1:02:25] because marriage as the prophet said is
[1:02:27] a covenant between men and women. Amen.
[1:02:30] Your covenant is what marries you. Yes.
[1:02:33] Amen. Amen. That's why as brother Ron
[1:02:36] said he always ask if somebody come and
[1:02:39] want to to ask his permission to know a
[1:02:42] certain woman instead the first thing he
[1:02:45] will ask are you engaged?
[1:02:47] Yes. Because if you are engaged then you
[1:02:50] cannot marry any other one. Yes. Because
[1:02:54] if you are engaged now being pronounced
[1:02:56] and marry another one then you are
[1:02:58] committing adultery
[1:03:01] because your covenant are already the
[1:03:04] one that married you then follow the
[1:03:09] ceremony. So in Hebrews chapter 2
[1:03:14] verse1, therefore we ought to give the
[1:03:16] more earnest heed to the things we have
[1:03:19] heard.
[1:03:21] Less at any time we should let them
[1:03:24] sleep. What we heard in these last days,
[1:03:27] we heard about our our our portion in
[1:03:32] the scripture. We heard about the
[1:03:34] mystery of God being revealed in our day
[1:03:37] and we need to take hold of it. Right?
[1:03:42] Lest at any time we should let them
[1:03:44] sleep. Even Revelation chapter 2:25, but
[1:03:47] that which we have already,
[1:03:50] you already have the revelation of the
[1:03:52] word in your day.
[1:03:55] Hold fast.
[1:03:57] Till he said, "Till I come." You need to
[1:04:01] hold fast. Amen.
[1:04:04] So there's so many disappointment coming
[1:04:07] our ways against the prophet against we
[1:04:10] are and tendency is
[1:04:13] sometimes even in the Philippines there
[1:04:16] was a a a certain brother from Texas
[1:04:19] going there and promoted that the
[1:04:21] prophet is this the prophet is that the
[1:04:23] prophet is false he's prophesy and all
[1:04:26] those healing campaign are not
[1:04:29] true. Amen.
[1:04:32] But one thing I noticed that he
[1:04:35] don't go to a minister
[1:04:38] to share his view. He don't go to a
[1:04:41] minister. He don't go to the elders, but
[1:04:44] he goes to those who are weak in the
[1:04:46] spirit. That's right.
[1:04:49] Just like the scripture say they're
[1:04:51] going from house to house.
[1:04:55] Silly women,
[1:04:58] but they don't want to face a minister.
[1:05:01] They don't want to face an altar. But
[1:05:03] those who are weak, they are the one
[1:05:04] that is
[1:05:06] being and many a lot of them who are in
[1:05:08] the message for so long sometimes sleep
[1:05:14] because what they are saying is so
[1:05:17] convincing
[1:05:18] if you are
[1:05:20] not have a solid foundation in the word
[1:05:23] of God.
[1:05:24] So that's why we need to take hold.
[1:05:27] Amen.
[1:05:30] Sometimes in our in our
[1:05:33] journey in the message of the hour
[1:05:36] there's a lot of destructions along our
[1:05:38] way.
[1:05:40] Even when I was new in the
[1:05:42] message there is a so much doctrine
[1:05:46] along my journey
[1:05:47] that sometimes I am so confused. There
[1:05:52] are the parroia there are the two souls.
[1:05:55] there are the return and
[1:05:57] sometimes I feel like I'm questioning
[1:06:03] myself but one thing that convince me
[1:06:07] I am a sinner a drunkard a host then
[1:06:10] when I receive the message I become a
[1:06:13] new creation in Christ Jesus that's what
[1:06:16] I hold on in my life even though I don't
[1:06:19] understand but I still hold I'm fully
[1:06:21] convinced that the message that I
[1:06:23] receive is true
[1:06:25] Hallelujah. And we receive the prophet.
[1:06:27] Every time I see the life story of the
[1:06:30] prophet, I stay with the life story of
[1:06:32] the prophet because his life story
[1:06:35] [Applause]
[1:06:38] is a supernatural life.
[1:06:44] Because I was a I was a short-tempered
[1:06:46] guy. I don't I'm easily get angry. But
[1:06:50] when I read the life story of the
[1:06:52] prophet, it humbled myself. Thank you,
[1:06:55] Lord. And I desire to be like him. Amen.
[1:06:59] Lord, help me to become humble just like
[1:07:02] this brother. To be loving like this
[1:07:05] brother. Even though he has a lot of
[1:07:09] signs and wonder in his ministry, but
[1:07:12] never did one time that he boast about
[1:07:15] his ministry. He stay humble. Amen.
[1:07:19] While I look at the denomination, PhD,
[1:07:22] HHD, all of the DDD,
[1:07:25] they talk about their diploma, their
[1:07:28] accomplishment,
[1:07:30] but the prophet, thousands and thousands
[1:07:32] are healing in his campaign, but still
[1:07:35] remain humble and can accept his
[1:07:38] mistakes.
[1:07:40] That's where I follow this man. Amen.
[1:07:43] because his life project Christ. So
[1:07:46] that's why even though I have so many
[1:07:48] doctrines along the way as if I'm conf I
[1:07:51] stay with the prophet in these last days
[1:07:54] because along the way if just continue
[1:07:56] to hold on God will reveal himself more
[1:08:00] and more and more. Hallelujah. The more
[1:08:03] I stay on the word of God the more he
[1:08:06] reveal himself. Irregardless of the
[1:08:10] confusion along a way, just stay with
[1:08:12] the word. Hold fast.
[1:08:16] Hallelujah. You need to hold fast to the
[1:08:18] word. Irregardless of anybody else what
[1:08:21] they're saying. You need to stay focused
[1:08:23] on the word. That's why this is not an
[1:08:26] organization. This is not a religious.
[1:08:29] This is a personal revelation. Personal
[1:08:32] relationship with Christ
[1:08:35] between you and him.
[1:08:38] Hallelujah.
[1:08:41] Praise be to God.
[1:08:43] Hold fast. We know that what caused the
[1:08:46] fall of men was that Eve failed to hold
[1:08:50] fast to the word that was given to hold
[1:08:53] to for her
[1:08:56] day. The early church also failed to
[1:08:59] hold fast to the word that was given for
[1:09:01] their day.
[1:09:04] But in this
[1:09:05] hour, we are called to hold to every
[1:09:09] word of promise that has been given for
[1:09:13] this day. We don't dug one word in this
[1:09:16] hour or we will
[1:09:18] like we will be like Eve again. We need
[1:09:23] to hold on every word. Amen. Whatever
[1:09:26] word that is being revealed, just hold
[1:09:28] on to that. Amen. Don't go overboard and
[1:09:32] to know more and to know more and become
[1:09:35] pop up. Just stay with the word. As long
[1:09:38] as he give you the word, just stay with
[1:09:39] it and wait for another revelation
[1:09:42] coming. Stay with it.
[1:09:45] Don't be arrogant. Don't be know it all.
[1:09:49] Just stay humble and Lord help me.
[1:09:52] Reveal yourself to me Lord that I can
[1:09:54] live the life according
[1:09:58] to your grace. Amen. So we believe in
[1:10:00] the promise of Christ and his bride
[1:10:02] becoming one in this hour. Do you
[1:10:04] believe it that the uniting time has
[1:10:07] come uniting of the bride and the groom,
[1:10:09] the invisible union of the bride and
[1:10:11] groom take place in these last days?
[1:10:14] The headstone uniting with the body and
[1:10:18] the promise of a super church. You
[1:10:21] become a super church, a super race.
[1:10:27] Amen. And sometimes people will hear,
[1:10:29] "Oh, super race, you boast so much." No,
[1:10:32] we are not boasting so much. That's
[1:10:34] right.
[1:10:37] We just receive the privilege that we
[1:10:39] are called a super church. Thank you,
[1:10:41] Lord.
[1:10:44] Nobody called a super church but the
[1:10:47] prophet of God.
[1:10:49] And the prophet of God only has thus
[1:10:51] said the Lord. So it was God himself who
[1:10:54] identify us as his super church. Amen.
[1:10:58] Amen.
[1:11:00] The promise of a body
[1:11:02] change. First
[1:11:04] Thessalonians. This is the promise of a
[1:11:06] body chains.
[1:11:10] And brother Brham quote Genesis chapter
[1:11:13] 18. Abraham and Sarah.
[1:11:17] Before the promised son came, God has to
[1:11:21] change the body.
[1:11:23] Hallelujah. And he type it in our day.
[1:11:27] In order to meet Christ in the air, he
[1:11:30] need to change our body in the moment,
[1:11:33] in the twinkling of an eye.
[1:11:37] Let us not figure out how he changed our
[1:11:40] body. We just believe it. He will change
[1:11:43] it in the moment, in the twinkling of an
[1:11:46] eye. It's up to him to do it. But what
[1:11:51] he require from us just to believe it.
[1:11:57] And it's not easy to believe.
[1:12:00] Unless you are a part of God, you cannot
[1:12:02] believe this word. That's right.
[1:12:05] Because not everybody can receive it.
[1:12:09] Only a special class of people. Thank
[1:12:11] you, Lord. Hallelujah. All these things
[1:12:15] we know to be true because the one who
[1:12:17] promised is able to keep all of his
[1:12:20] promises.
[1:12:22] One who promised he's able to keep his
[1:12:24] promise.
[1:12:26] So we have been promised all these
[1:12:27] things and we are to believe and hold
[1:12:29] fast to every word. Amen.
[1:12:33] Not a selected word but the word that is
[1:12:37] being revealed to you. Whatever revealed
[1:12:40] to you that's yours. Right? Don't
[1:12:44] compare it to anybody else.
[1:12:46] Just be faithful to what he revealed
[1:12:49] unto you because not everybody grows the
[1:12:52] same.
[1:12:56] So we need just to be faithful as he
[1:12:58] reveal himself to each and every one of
[1:13:00] us. Amen. Amen. In the message proving
[1:13:04] his
[1:13:07] word paragraph
[1:13:09] 122 said now I want you to notice he
[1:13:13] does it that way in every
[1:13:16] age. He does it every time by the same
[1:13:19] method. What did he doing at the same
[1:13:22] time? In every church aid he sent a word
[1:13:26] and when he sent a word he fulfilled the
[1:13:28] word and that is his
[1:13:33] method. He has to take believers and
[1:13:36] then in order to have believers to meet
[1:13:39] the word he's got to predestinate it to
[1:13:43] that age. Amen. You see, he's got to
[1:13:47] predestinate this thing to be here to
[1:13:50] meet the challenge of the age. Amen. Did
[1:13:53] you get it? Did you feel it? In other
[1:13:56] words, if you have truly seen the
[1:13:58] message of the hour, then that can only
[1:14:02] be because God before the foundation of
[1:14:05] the word ordained you to believe that
[1:14:08] word. Hallelujah. So he had been you had
[1:14:12] been born into this age to receive the
[1:14:14] word for this age so that you could meet
[1:14:16] the challenge of this age.
[1:14:20] The message of this hour equips you. Yes
[1:14:23] sir. For the challenge of the hour.
[1:14:28] Hallelujah. We cannot stand this loudest
[1:14:31] nuclearness unless God equip to stand in
[1:14:34] this in this loudest year because as as
[1:14:39] said when the enemy come in like a plug
[1:14:43] God will raise up a standard against it.
[1:14:46] So that's why he will equip up equip us
[1:14:50] to challenge the age that we are living
[1:14:52] in just like when the seven seal was
[1:14:55] opened the first seal that was a white
[1:14:57] horse.
[1:14:58] And it was a deception. And God raised
[1:15:01] up a standard to challenge that white
[1:15:03] horse and he sent hallelujah a lion to
[1:15:07] combat
[1:15:10] the white
[1:15:11] horse. Then another one, Satan sent a
[1:15:16] red horse and God challenged it. He sent
[1:15:18] an ox.
[1:15:21] Then he said a black horse. Then God
[1:15:25] sent face of a man in the pale horse and
[1:15:29] God challenged it in the face of an
[1:15:31] eagle. God always equip his
[1:15:33] predestinated
[1:15:35] for the challenge of the hour.
[1:15:38] When God raised up a standard against
[1:15:41] the flood of the enemy, who is that
[1:15:44] standard to challenge the flood of the
[1:15:46] enemy?
[1:15:48] You are the standard
[1:15:52] that will challenge
[1:15:54] hallelujah
[1:15:56] Satan in these last days because the
[1:15:58] word of God is in you. So that's why you
[1:16:01] become the standard in these last days.
[1:16:04] Especially our women when you go to a
[1:16:06] mall you become the standard that they
[1:16:08] will see mostly of the women wearing
[1:16:11] short and everything but you are when
[1:16:13] you walk in that aisle in the mall you
[1:16:15] become the standard in this generation
[1:16:19] yes sir our young men they're living
[1:16:22] clean
[1:16:24] when you walk you don't smoke you don't
[1:16:26] drink you become a standard in this
[1:16:29] generation and someday when judgment
[1:16:31] strike you will get strike You will be
[1:16:35] the judge in this generation.
[1:16:38] Hallelujah.
[1:16:40] Yes sir.
[1:16:42] That's why we are not survivor in this
[1:16:44] loud this year. We are overcomers.
[1:16:48] Because God equip us to be an overcomer
[1:16:51] in this last day. Become a standard in
[1:16:53] these last days. Hallelujah. It was
[1:16:56] God's
[1:16:58] doing. He's got to predestinate it to
[1:17:01] that age. You see, it's got to
[1:17:03] predestinate this thing to be here to
[1:17:05] meet the challenge of the age. Amen.
[1:17:07] Thank you, Lord. So, it's not our
[1:17:10] battle, it's God's battle.
[1:17:13] Hallelujah. So, if you fall or if you
[1:17:16] fail, don't blame it to somebody else.
[1:17:18] God allows it.
[1:17:21] Hallelujah.
[1:17:23] In order for his name to be glorified.
[1:17:28] That's right. I've got to be this thing
[1:17:30] to be here to meet the challenge rate.
[1:17:32] Did you get it? Did it get you? Did you
[1:17:36] feel it? Do you understand it?
[1:17:40] That's what happening today. He
[1:17:42] predestinated it to be to this by his
[1:17:45] fornowledge. And when he predestinated
[1:17:48] in Malachi 4, it's got to happen. Amen.
[1:17:52] And when he produced the name Malachi 4,
[1:17:55] what is the scripture written in Malachi
[1:17:58] 4? He said, I will send you Elijah the
[1:18:01] prophet.
[1:18:03] So if that is being the word made
[1:18:05] manifest, the Elijah manifest. How about
[1:18:09] the you?
[1:18:13] We are the people of the you. Amen. So
[1:18:16] if Malachi 4 is being fulfilled, you are
[1:18:19] fulfilling with Malachi 4 because you
[1:18:21] are the people to fulfill. Hallelujah.
[1:18:25] In Malachi 4 has sent you Elijah the
[1:18:27] prophet because without you he will not
[1:18:30] send Elijah
[1:18:32] because you are in his mind before the
[1:18:34] foundation of the word in order for you
[1:18:36] to recognize your day. He will send you
[1:18:39] Elijah the prophet in order to turn your
[1:18:42] heart back to the original of faith of
[1:18:43] the father. Amen. Hallelujah. You are in
[1:18:46] his mind first.
[1:18:49] Before his Elijah.
[1:18:51] Hallelujah.
[1:18:57] When he come over and predestinate
[1:18:59] anything to happen and it says it will
[1:19:02] happen in his word, he had to prove his
[1:19:05] word to be. So did God prove it? Amen.
[1:19:11] You are the testimony
[1:19:14] of how he fulfilled Malachi 4 because
[1:19:18] you are not following a man. You're not
[1:19:19] following an organization. You are
[1:19:21] following Christ which the Malachi 4
[1:19:24] introduced.
[1:19:26] And he said I must decrease and he must
[1:19:29] increase. You are embracing not the
[1:19:31] prophet but you are embracing the Christ
[1:19:34] the God of the prophet in these last
[1:19:35] days. That's right. Amen. When he
[1:19:38] predestinate anything to happen and says
[1:19:41] it will happen, he knows that seed will
[1:19:44] be there just at that time. God is
[1:19:47] always on time. He never been late.
[1:19:50] Hallelujah.
[1:19:52] He predestinated a bride.
[1:19:57] Yes. Predestinated a bride.
[1:20:04] It is already a
[1:20:05] declaration. That's right. He didn't
[1:20:08] preditionate an organization.
[1:20:10] He didn't preditionate William Burnham
[1:20:12] organization.
[1:20:14] He predestinated a bride.
[1:20:19] Hallelujah. She's going to be there.
[1:20:22] Hallelujah. If he predator is a bride,
[1:20:25] he is going to be there in this loudia.
[1:20:28] And he will become a standard in this
[1:20:30] loudia.
[1:20:32] Hallelujah. Wow. Wow. She is going to be
[1:20:36] there. He predestinated it by his
[1:20:39] fornowledge.
[1:20:40] So there's nothing going to stop it.
[1:20:45] Hallelujah. Whatever your trial and
[1:20:47] testing in life, whatever failures,
[1:20:51] no one can stop it because God
[1:20:54] predestinated a bride to manifest in
[1:20:56] these last days.
[1:20:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:00] So we can find rest in his promises.
[1:21:03] Don't struggle too much. I do this, I do
[1:21:06] this, I do this. Then you fail. Then you
[1:21:08] got discouraged.
[1:21:10] But when God revealed to you the who you
[1:21:13] are, it will become just like you can
[1:21:17] find rest.
[1:21:19] Lord, I know whatever happened in my
[1:21:21] journey in life, I know you are in
[1:21:23] complete control because you are
[1:21:26] predestinated. You predestinated me to
[1:21:28] be the bride of Jesus Christ and no one
[1:21:30] can take away my position in your word.
[1:21:34] So whatever happen I don't desire to
[1:21:36] commit sin but I just lay Lord I stay
[1:21:39] humble. I stay true to your word
[1:21:42] but sometimes circumstances come around
[1:21:44] and I cannot help it
[1:21:48] but God humble myself
[1:21:51] and he will do the rest. Don't struggle.
[1:21:54] Amen. That's why people say, "Oh,
[1:21:56] brother Mario, do you have any plan or
[1:22:01] trip this year?" And I always say, "No,
[1:22:04] I don't have any
[1:22:09] plan financially. I don't have the
[1:22:11] capacity to
[1:22:16] plan. I learn to trust in him." Amen. I
[1:22:21] believe if God put a gift in my heart,
[1:22:25] he will make a way. That's why he said,
[1:22:28] "Do you have plan?" I don't have plan.
[1:22:31] Then just few few days later, I was
[1:22:34] invited to to Italy.
[1:22:38] Well, I don't have any
[1:22:40] money, but God made a way.
[1:22:45] Thank you, Lord. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:22:47] Amen.
[1:22:49] And thank you, brother Ron, for the
[1:22:51] support.
[1:22:54] But before that, I don't have any plan.
[1:22:59] Maybe somebody, oh, brother Mario is a
[1:23:02] liar. He always told me that he don't
[1:23:05] have any plan, but now he's
[1:23:09] going. But as sons and daughters of God,
[1:23:12] we rely upon the leading of the spirit
[1:23:14] of God. We don't plan but God planned
[1:23:17] for us because the footstep of the
[1:23:19] righteous men are ordered arranged by
[1:23:23] God and he knows where to put his gift
[1:23:27] because gift of God always find their
[1:23:29] places.
[1:23:31] Hallelujah. It is for the
[1:23:34] edification of the body until we come
[1:23:36] into the unity of the faith. It has
[1:23:39] nothing to do with our physical being.
[1:23:44] Hallelujah.
[1:23:47] You must be able to recognize and
[1:23:50] identify the word being fulfilled in
[1:23:52] your own life
[1:23:55] because the word of this hour must
[1:23:57] become your
[1:23:59] experience in the story of story of your
[1:24:03] own personal life. True brother because
[1:24:07] this is a personal walk with God.
[1:24:10] You cannot compare yourself to anybody
[1:24:12] else but compare yourself with the
[1:24:16] scripture.
[1:24:17] Whatever character you can see is always
[1:24:20] reflect your journey in life. Amen.
[1:24:26] Because the word of this hour must
[1:24:28] become your experience in the story of
[1:24:30] your own personal life. Because in the
[1:24:32] volume of the
[1:24:35] book, it is
[1:24:38] written of the pattern of your life.
[1:24:44] So in the story of Ruth, all these
[1:24:47] characters in the Bible, the story of
[1:24:49] Ruth, of Rebecca, of Abraham and Sarah,
[1:24:53] of Abigail, of Rahab, they all
[1:24:59] reflect our journey in life.
[1:25:04] One way or another, we can relymen,
[1:25:07] we can relate. Amen. To their story that
[1:25:10] it is I
[1:25:12] In Rebecca, it is I. In Abigate, it is
[1:25:16] I. In Rahab, it is I. It is I.
[1:25:23] Hallelujah.
[1:25:25] Just like you came out of Egypt of
[1:25:27] denominational system by the leadership
[1:25:30] of an Exodus bracket. So we now have a
[1:25:32] third Exodus prophet. Amen. We come out
[1:25:35] from denominational bondage and come to
[1:25:37] the promised land of the hour. Thank
[1:25:39] you, Lord. Like Rahab, you have received
[1:25:42] the message that was sent by Joshua. And
[1:25:44] he embraced the message of the hour.
[1:25:49] And in order for to be saved during the
[1:25:52] judgment in Jericho, you need to be
[1:25:55] under Rahab.
[1:25:57] Amen.
[1:25:59] Umbrella.
[1:26:01] Because he become the mouthpiece
[1:26:04] in Jericho. without going in Rahham,
[1:26:09] everything will be judged. That's right.
[1:26:11] She become the mouthpiece. She become
[1:26:13] the token. She become the standard in
[1:26:15] the day because she received the message
[1:26:17] of the hour. That's why when we you
[1:26:19] receive the message of the hour, you
[1:26:22] become the mouthpiece of God. You are
[1:26:24] the final voice in this generation.
[1:26:26] Amen. They cannot find they cannot find
[1:26:30] they cannot find eternal life except for
[1:26:33] you and I
[1:26:35] because we are carrying the word the
[1:26:38] revealed word of the hour and he said my
[1:26:41] word they are spirit and they are life
[1:26:44] not the word of Luther Wesley or
[1:26:46] Pentecost or that the word that is being
[1:26:48] revealed in your what is that word the
[1:26:51] word Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:26:56] sir
[1:26:59] As the prophet told of the little boy
[1:27:02] that saw himself in the mirror for the
[1:27:04] first
[1:27:05] time, he's looking at them. Every time
[1:27:07] he move, the boy in the mirror
[1:27:11] move. When he smile, he's also smiling.
[1:27:16] Whatever he's doing, the boy in the
[1:27:19] mirror is acting just like the same. and
[1:27:23] he's wondering why he's trying to figure
[1:27:25] out who is this or what is that or who
[1:27:28] is this
[1:27:30] boy
[1:27:32] but one day he said mama that's me
[1:27:38] mama that's me hallelujah this is how
[1:27:43] you come into the message of the hour
[1:27:46] when you read about the stories of the
[1:27:48] old testament mama that's me mama that's
[1:27:51] me in Abraham
[1:27:52] Mama does mean Sarah. Mama does mean
[1:27:55] Elisa. Mama does mean Rebecca. Because
[1:27:58] the life that you live is a reflections
[1:28:00] of the word. That's why when the word
[1:28:02] was open and called your name, you
[1:28:05] responded to it because the ministry of
[1:28:08] your life is being revealed.
[1:28:11] Hallelujah. You can relate to the
[1:28:13] opening of the word. The calling of your
[1:28:14] name is the mystery being revealed. And
[1:28:17] you responded, "Mama, that's me. Amen.
[1:28:21] Mama, that's me.
[1:28:24] Don't give it to others.
[1:28:28] God predestinated your life for this
[1:28:31] hour
[1:28:33] to perform and to fulfill certain part
[1:28:37] of his word for this time. Just the same
[1:28:40] that he predestinated brother Brham's
[1:28:43] life for this day to perform certain
[1:28:46] part of the word that he was to leave
[1:28:48] out of this time. Amen. I send you
[1:28:52] Elijah the prophet. We have a part to
[1:28:55] fulfill
[1:28:57] not by our own struggle
[1:29:01] but how much we surrender our life.
[1:29:04] Let me be used by you Lord. Amen. Let my
[1:29:08] mouth be your mouth. Let my eye be your
[1:29:11] eye. Let my feet be your feet
[1:29:14] in these last days. Amen. Because we
[1:29:17] have part to fulfill in these last days.
[1:29:19] That's why we can say we are not an
[1:29:21] ordinary people.
[1:29:25] If people around the world look at us,
[1:29:27] we become ordinary. It's just okay.
[1:29:30] But in the eye of God, we are a special
[1:29:33] class of people. Amen. And you are a man
[1:29:36] of valor.
[1:29:38] Hallelujah. You are a man of strength.
[1:29:45] And even if God is not done with you in
[1:29:49] this earth, no one can take your life.
[1:29:52] That's right. Amen.
[1:29:55] Amen. Remember the prophet said John the
[1:29:57] Baptist or John the
[1:29:59] Beloved was cooked in oil for 24
[1:30:06] hours. He fried John.
[1:30:14] When you put chicken only 15 minutes but
[1:30:17] John 24 hours
[1:30:21] and he's swimming and he is having a spa
[1:30:25] but with oil
[1:30:30] and he's rejoicing
[1:30:33] because if God is not done with you no
[1:30:36] one can take your place. No one can take
[1:30:40] God's place because he need to fulfill
[1:30:42] prophecy because he was the one that was
[1:30:46] given to write all this prophecy because
[1:30:48] the revelation of Jesus Christ was given
[1:30:50] to him.
[1:30:53] That's why no one can touch him. Even
[1:30:56] you pray him.
[1:30:58] It become a a
[1:31:01] sona with oil.
[1:31:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:07] Even uh during the reign of Hitler, I
[1:31:10] just read it that there was an attempt
[1:31:14] assassinations for Adop Hitler during
[1:31:17] his reign. In fact, they recorded 18 in
[1:31:20] total.
[1:31:23] Aiden attempt to kill assassinate Hitler
[1:31:28] but no one can touch him. It seems that
[1:31:30] he become
[1:31:33] invisible because the scripture had to
[1:31:35] be fulfilled in that a third of Jewish
[1:31:38] population had to die in the Holocaust
[1:31:41] according to the prophecy of the
[1:31:43] scripture.
[1:31:45] So that's why if God is not finished
[1:31:46] with you, no one can touch you. You need
[1:31:49] to fulfill what part of the scripture
[1:31:51] doing
[1:31:52] doing. So if a gayser are prophesied to
[1:31:56] arise against the Exodus prophet in fact
[1:31:59] the third Exodus
[1:32:01] prophet because an Exodus is coming out
[1:32:04] and going in.
[1:32:09] Gainsayer are prophesied to
[1:32:12] arise in the last days.
[1:32:16] Then there will have to be a people to
[1:32:18] fulfill part of the prophecy. So we as
[1:32:21] the bride need to watch these things and
[1:32:23] to know what is happening in this hour
[1:32:25] by what has been prophesied for this
[1:32:27] hour. Amen. Our day has arrived. These
[1:32:31] culpers are already on rise.
[1:32:34] The disobedient to the word against
[1:32:37] arise and it's up for him to look up.
[1:32:39] It's up for us to look up. Our
[1:32:41] redemption is draw at night. Hallelujah.
[1:32:43] So it is not always an accident that
[1:32:45] they come out and manifest or rise in
[1:32:47] these last days. It is time for us to
[1:32:49] take hold of the word that was being
[1:32:52] given to us. Amen.
[1:32:54] First Peter I read it once again knowing
[1:32:57] this verse that there shall come in the
[1:32:59] last days scuppers walking after their
[1:33:01] own lust and saying where is the promise
[1:33:03] of his coming?
[1:33:05] Hallelujah.
[1:33:08] Let the sculper do their works.
[1:33:11] As brother Ron, you are already too
[1:33:14] late.
[1:33:15] We are already being caught up by the
[1:33:17] revelation of the word of God. And no
[1:33:20] one and no way for us to go back. There
[1:33:24] is no turning back because we have
[1:33:26] already reached the point of no return.
[1:33:29] Hallelujah. We are now walking.
[1:33:33] The shout we heard, the voice we heard.
[1:33:35] We are waiting for the trump of God for
[1:33:38] the changing of our body, the gathering
[1:33:40] together of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:33:42] That's why we have reached the point of
[1:33:44] no return. Amen. Keep going on. Hold
[1:33:48] fast to the word that you have been
[1:33:51] revealed. So, brother Bernham told us
[1:33:54] that the book of Jude that there were
[1:33:56] some deeper things in this book that we
[1:33:59] need to learn about regarding the
[1:34:01] gaining of
[1:34:03] Kora.
[1:34:05] Excuse
[1:34:11] me. So in Jude chapter
[1:34:17] one, so you don't need to open up. Maybe
[1:34:20] I we have that in the
[1:34:22] board. Jude chapter 1 verse 5. I will
[1:34:25] therefore put you in remembrance.
[1:34:28] Though ye once knew this, how that the
[1:34:30] Lord, having saved the people out of the
[1:34:33] land of Egypt, afterward destroy them
[1:34:35] that believe not. These are the same
[1:34:38] people who came out under the ministry
[1:34:40] of an Exodus prophet. They come out, but
[1:34:43] they didn't go all the way to the
[1:34:45] promised land. They become contented.
[1:34:48] They put period on what they believe.
[1:34:52] And the angel which kept not their first
[1:34:54] estate, but left their own habitation,
[1:34:57] he hath reserved in everlasting chains
[1:35:01] under darkness until the judgment of the
[1:35:04] great day. So these people failed to
[1:35:07] hold fast to the truth of what they had
[1:35:10] originally been given. They fell for the
[1:35:13] first state. Your estate is your
[1:35:16] original domain.
[1:35:20] domain opposition of what God has placed
[1:35:22] you in truth for your age. Amen.
[1:35:27] In Jude chapter we jump on
[1:35:30] 11. Woe unto them for they have gone in
[1:35:33] the way of Cain.
[1:35:36] So he has special mentions about Cain.
[1:35:39] Remember in the book of Hebrew that God
[1:35:41] Cain
[1:35:42] offered an excellent sacrifice unto God.
[1:35:47] Yeah. Woe unto them for they have gone
[1:35:50] in the way of Cain. Remember that Cain
[1:35:52] wanted God to accept his religious
[1:35:55] sacrifice that was contrary to the
[1:35:58] revelations for that
[1:36:00] hour. God rejected just as denomination
[1:36:04] this day when God want God to accept
[1:36:07] their false form of worship God has to
[1:36:10] reject it in this day. Just like Cain
[1:36:14] offered the more or an excellent
[1:36:17] sacrifice. This is not that ordinary
[1:36:19] sacrifice in an excellent sacrifice. But
[1:36:22] because it didn't come from the
[1:36:23] revelation of God, God rejected it.
[1:36:27] That's why woe unto them for they have
[1:36:29] gone in the way of
[1:36:31] Cain and
[1:36:33] run greedily after the error of Balam
[1:36:37] for reward. came Balam and Balam was
[1:36:40] hungry for the dollars.
[1:36:44] He loved the money and the money was
[1:36:45] more important to him than staying true
[1:36:47] to the word of God. We can see it all
[1:36:49] around us in these last days. The way of
[1:36:51] Cain, the way of
[1:36:53] Balam.
[1:36:55] Amen. And we know
[1:36:57] that how it ended and perished in the
[1:37:01] gain saying of Kora.
[1:37:04] What about Kora? Kora was the one who
[1:37:07] withtood the Exodus prophet of his day.
[1:37:11] Saying that he had the others were just
[1:37:13] as good as Moses.
[1:37:17] God didn't like that. And we know what
[1:37:18] happened of how the earth opened up and
[1:37:21] swallowed them all down. You watch
[1:37:22] people that give this message because of
[1:37:24] the gain saying of Kora. Yeah. I am the
[1:37:27] eighth messenger. I am the only bride.
[1:37:30] We are the only group.
[1:37:32] Gaining of Kora. They identify
[1:37:36] themselves according to what they want.
[1:37:39] I am the next apostle. I am the next
[1:37:41] eight messenger. I am ordained of God. I
[1:37:44] am the eagle of this age.
[1:37:52] God didn't like that. And we know what
[1:37:54] happened to the earth open and swallowed
[1:37:56] them all down. You watch people that
[1:37:57] give the message because of the gains
[1:37:59] and gains saying of course in this day
[1:38:02] the earth
[1:38:06] Worthiness eventually swallow them up.
[1:38:10] They proclaim I'm this, I am that, but
[1:38:12] they are leaning on different direction.
[1:38:17] They allow short hair, they allow pants,
[1:38:19] they allow everything. They are free.
[1:38:26] Not only happen here, happen in my
[1:38:28] country. That's why I can preach about
[1:38:30] that because I am a witness to that.
[1:38:32] Amen. They always claim to be what they
[1:38:35] are.
[1:38:38] So in Jude chapter 17, but beloved,
[1:38:40] remember ye the words which were spoken
[1:38:44] before of the apostle of the Lord Jesus
[1:38:46] Christ.
[1:38:49] Gain saying Cain, Balam, and Kora. But
[1:38:53] in 17, but beloved, remember you the
[1:38:56] words which have spoken before of the
[1:38:58] apostle Lord Jesus Christ. How that they
[1:39:01] told you there should be a mockers in
[1:39:04] the last time who should walk after
[1:39:07] their own ungodied lust. This mockers
[1:39:11] are people are grumbler and complainers
[1:39:15] living only to satisfy their desire.
[1:39:18] They brag loudly about themselves and
[1:39:20] they flatter others to get what they
[1:39:23] want.
[1:39:24] We can see it all around us.
[1:39:27] But a real
[1:39:29] believers, you can hardly hear them
[1:39:33] bragging about themselves.
[1:39:35] They just humble themselves. Yes.
[1:39:41] You know when people brag about
[1:39:43] themselves, it's full of wind.
[1:39:46] Nothing in there. Amen.
[1:39:49] But when people are humble themselves,
[1:39:52] just lies the grain. You know that it's
[1:39:54] heavy because it's loaded. It just
[1:39:57] humble themselves. Very good.
[1:40:01] Verse 18. This be they who separate
[1:40:04] themselves and sensual having not the
[1:40:07] spirit but ye beloved building up
[1:40:10] yourselves on your most holy faith
[1:40:14] praying in the Holy Ghost. Keep yourself
[1:40:16] in the love of God looking for the mercy
[1:40:19] of our Lord Jesus Christ into eternal
[1:40:21] life. You need to hold fast the word
[1:40:24] that we receive and be so in love with
[1:40:26] the Lord Jesus Christ. Because the more
[1:40:28] you become in love with the Lord Jesus
[1:40:30] Christ, you are
[1:40:32] ashamed to
[1:40:34] commit sin against the word of God.
[1:40:37] That's right.
[1:40:40] Because if you don't know what you
[1:40:42] believe,
[1:40:46] you look at the Facebook, you look the
[1:40:48] Instagram, you look for media, you look
[1:40:50] for something. But if you know who you
[1:40:53] are, you stay humble and stay in the
[1:40:55] word of God and God will lead you. You
[1:40:58] don't have desire for somebody else. Of
[1:41:03] course, the body is human. We fail
[1:41:06] sometime. We get discouraged.
[1:41:09] But that is part of our Christian life.
[1:41:13] Amen. You don't really desire to fail.
[1:41:16] You pray
[1:41:19] hard to be sincere in your walk with
[1:41:23] God. But along the way, God knows what
[1:41:27] he wants best for us. And that is
[1:41:30] through trials and testings and
[1:41:33] everything. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:36] Thessalonians 5:21, prove all things,
[1:41:39] hold fast to that which is good.
[1:41:43] What is good is the revealed word of the
[1:41:46] hour. in a message proving his
[1:41:52] word said we have a
[1:41:55] scripture and Jesus said all scripture
[1:41:58] must be
[1:41:59] fulfilled that we should prove all
[1:42:01] things and then hold fast or hold tight
[1:42:06] get a death grip on it and don't turn it
[1:42:10] loose hold fast to that which is good
[1:42:13] it it you make this word between life
[1:42:16] and yet. Amen. You need to hold fast.
[1:42:20] Amen. Now, we see another one. Then you
[1:42:23] no doubt have heard them say, "Seeing is
[1:42:26] believing."
[1:42:28] That's another old proverb we have here.
[1:42:30] But that doesn't work either. It's true.
[1:42:33] It doesn't work cuz men can sit and look
[1:42:36] right straight at anything and they'll
[1:42:40] not see it. That's right.
[1:42:43] The word sea in English word sea has the
[1:42:46] many different meaning to
[1:42:49] it. So he put se as in the sea is a
[1:42:53] might mean a body of water and see might
[1:42:56] mean to
[1:42:57] understand. See might mean to look at
[1:43:00] it. I know there's just all kind of
[1:43:02] words you can use. But when you say
[1:43:05] seeing is believing,
[1:43:07] you're not mistaken.
[1:43:10] Or see, but when you say seeing is
[1:43:12] believing, you're mistaken. That's
[1:43:14] right.
[1:43:16] Because when you understand it, you
[1:43:18] believe it.
[1:43:20] Amen.
[1:43:22] How can you believe if you don't
[1:43:24] understand?
[1:43:26] That's why the prophet sent Elijah in
[1:43:29] these last days to open the seal to
[1:43:32] gather all those loosened that we might
[1:43:35] understand the mystery of God that was
[1:43:38] hidden before the foundation of the
[1:43:40] word.
[1:43:42] Now we understand why he sent Elijah in
[1:43:46] this days. That's why we believe
[1:43:52] even though
[1:43:53] sometimes we cannot explain it but we
[1:43:57] understand it. Amen. That's why we
[1:43:59] believe we cannot believe and uh we
[1:44:03] cannot believe something unless we
[1:44:05] cannot
[1:44:06] understand. Right? That's why we have
[1:44:10] services Monday or Wednesday, Sunday a
[1:44:14] special holiday in order for us to
[1:44:17] understand.
[1:44:19] We have fivefold ministry. We have
[1:44:22] visiting ministry. That's why we are so
[1:44:23] blessed in this assembly.
[1:44:26] We have all kind of ministers coming in
[1:44:30] giving us the word of God. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:32] As brother Ron
[1:44:35] sometimes said that I have preached this
[1:44:37] subject. I have preached for so many for
[1:44:39] weeks and series and series. It seems
[1:44:42] that no one is amening. But when a
[1:44:44] minister is coming and he preach the
[1:44:47] same sermon that I preach, everybody is
[1:44:49] saying amening.
[1:44:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:54] It's the gift. Amen. To let us
[1:44:57] understand the word of God.
[1:45:00] That's why sometimes we we heard
[1:45:03] minister preach and another come and he
[1:45:05] preached the same sermon.
[1:45:10] But sometimes we wonder why why I don't
[1:45:13] say in my heart well I heard it but you
[1:45:15] rejoice because you want to understand
[1:45:20] you understand the word of God because
[1:45:22] the more you understand the word the
[1:45:24] more you live the word that you
[1:45:26] understand. How can you live something
[1:45:27] when you cannot understand? That's why
[1:45:30] praise the Lord that he has given us a
[1:45:32] five-fold ministry in the church. Amen.
[1:45:35] Hallelujah. A variety of gifts coming in
[1:45:37] the church that is to bring unity into
[1:45:39] the church. Hallelujah. Not only our
[1:45:42] local church, but we have the
[1:45:43] supplemental ministry
[1:45:47] coming in. That is to make us
[1:45:49] understand. Thank you Lord.
[1:45:53] That's why somebody that visiting our
[1:45:56] church, they are so blessed by the way
[1:45:58] we responds to the word of God because
[1:46:00] we have a pastor that capable to teach
[1:46:04] the word of God. You know that way and I
[1:46:08] always thank our congregations that they
[1:46:10] are so very appreciative of the word of
[1:46:13] God.
[1:46:15] Sometimes when I review my preaching,
[1:46:17] sometimes I am ashamed of
[1:46:19] myself because my grammar is over here,
[1:46:22] over here, over
[1:46:24] here. Sometimes my grammar is grumbling
[1:46:27] and the he will become she and the she
[1:46:29] will become
[1:46:30] he. So that's why I don't look at my my
[1:46:33] my
[1:46:34] videos. Forget it. Throw it.
[1:46:40] But thank you for the congregation that
[1:46:42] they just responds the way they they
[1:46:45] they just receive me for what I am.
[1:46:50] Actually, you're not receiving me.
[1:46:51] You're receiving the gift of God in your
[1:46:53] life. Because if I am, I will
[1:46:55] just Well, let's go continue. Praise the
[1:46:59] Lord.
[1:47:02] And see means to understand. She might
[1:47:05] mean to look at it. I know there just
[1:47:07] all kind of words you can use. But when
[1:47:09] you say seeing is believing, you're
[1:47:11] mistaken. But sometime you see, but it's
[1:47:13] not really you cannot really understand
[1:47:15] what you're seeing. When you understand,
[1:47:17] you believe it. Jesus said, "Except a
[1:47:19] man be born again, he cannot see the
[1:47:22] kingdom of God." So that's the main key.
[1:47:24] You need to be born again.
[1:47:27] In other words, understand the kingdom
[1:47:29] because the kingdom is the Holy Spirit
[1:47:32] in you.
[1:47:34] So you have to understand what this is
[1:47:37] in you.
[1:47:39] And the only way you'll understand it is
[1:47:42] compare what it makes you do with what
[1:47:47] the Bible said it would make you do.
[1:47:51] Then your problem solved and then he is
[1:47:54] the Holy Spirit because when the spirit
[1:47:57] of God in you, he will quicken the word
[1:48:01] in your life. Amen. Problem solved.
[1:48:04] Amen. Thank you Lord. Sometime when you
[1:48:07] have problem you need to know the cause
[1:48:08] of the problem because if you know the
[1:48:11] cause of the problem 50% of your problem
[1:48:14] is already being solved already being
[1:48:17] solved.
[1:48:18] You need to know the cause of your
[1:48:21] problem.
[1:48:24] So I'm calling our musician my last
[1:48:26] quote.
[1:48:28] Christ is the mystery of God
[1:48:32] revealed. Notice in these last days,
[1:48:35] Lucifer is doing the same thing. The
[1:48:38] devil doing the same thing. Building up
[1:48:41] a hybrid
[1:48:43] church, a hybrid by hybrid
[1:48:45] members, hybrid by knowledge instead of
[1:48:49] the word. Especially nowadays that the
[1:48:52] the AI or the intellectual artificial
[1:48:56] intelligence is so easy. Give me the
[1:48:59] code of this this and there are so many
[1:49:02] code. Give me the code.
[1:49:06] But one thing I
[1:49:08] noticed when I try it these scriptures,
[1:49:12] what is your comment about the
[1:49:14] scripture? And they
[1:49:18] put one thing I noticed even though I
[1:49:21] read it, there is no inspiration in it.
[1:49:25] Amen. It's true, brother. But when I go
[1:49:28] back to the tape and listen, there is
[1:49:32] always an anointing coming out of that.
[1:49:35] Even though how simple the word that you
[1:49:37] listen, God will just p add something
[1:49:41] littleer here, something here, go here,
[1:49:44] something here, something here. Amen.
[1:49:47] Hallelujah.
[1:49:49] Word upon word, here a little, here a
[1:49:52] little by thy inspiration.
[1:49:55] So that's why if you as the prophet
[1:49:57] said, you want to go deeper in the love,
[1:49:59] read the word of God. Read the word.
[1:50:01] Listen to the word. Don't listen to a
[1:50:04] that is good if you are in a hurry for
[1:50:06] something that to to to to
[1:50:09] to search for something that's
[1:50:13] okay but never use it as your sermon
[1:50:16] because there was no inspiration in it.
[1:50:19] Amen. We need inspiration. We need the
[1:50:22] Holy Ghost in our lives. We need the
[1:50:24] word to become alive in our life.
[1:50:27] Hallelujah. We had so much in these last
[1:50:30] days. The Holy Ghost is being poured out
[1:50:34] upon us.
[1:50:36] Thank you, Lord. That we may understand
[1:50:37] the mystery that was being hid from ages
[1:50:40] to ages. But now we are the most
[1:50:43] privileged people in these last days.
[1:50:46] Hallelujah. Did you wonder sometime ask
[1:50:50] your
[1:50:51] yourself why me Lord? Amen. Why did you
[1:50:56] chose me even before the foundation of
[1:50:58] the world?
[1:51:00] There are millions and millions and
[1:51:02] millions of people in this earth. Why
[1:51:03] me?
[1:51:08] He just said because I love you. Thank
[1:51:11] you Jesus.
[1:51:14] It is my prerogative
[1:51:17] my sovereign will
[1:51:19] to choose you even before the foundation
[1:51:23] of the world. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:51:26] Amen.
[1:51:28] So instead of asking and wondering what
[1:51:31] happened to your life, just give him
[1:51:32] praise.
[1:51:35] Just give him praise because he knows
[1:51:38] what he wants done with his word. You
[1:51:42] just surrender your life and trust in
[1:51:45] him.
[1:51:47] Hallelujah. Wonderful. Thank you. He may
[1:51:50] allow you to be broke financially.
[1:51:54] But he said, "I will supply all your
[1:51:56] needs according to the riches of his
[1:51:58] glory." Just seek his kingdom, the word,
[1:52:03] the Holy Ghost, and all your needs,
[1:52:06] financially,
[1:52:08] family affairs, whatever problem will
[1:52:12] just follow
[1:52:14] if you seek the Lord. Leave it unto him.
[1:52:18] [Music]
[1:52:20] Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:26] Hybrid by knowledge instead of the word,
[1:52:28] by intellectual men instead of born
[1:52:31] again
[1:52:32] men. Building an intellectual kingdom
[1:52:35] that will outshine Christ
[1:52:38] li what is it that did? Fallen angels.
[1:52:44] The Bible said it was fallen angels who
[1:52:46] listened to Lucifer instead of Christ
[1:52:50] who they once belonged to. Is that
[1:52:52] right?
[1:52:53] Now listen. Fallen
[1:52:55] angels. What kind of angels?
[1:53:02] Luther, Wesley, Catholic, Pentecostal,
[1:53:05] who kept not their first estate, and the
[1:53:08] angels did, and has fell into
[1:53:10] organization like Luther's main hold of
[1:53:13] Naa. And what have they done? Organized
[1:53:18] a great economical association of
[1:53:21] ministers to make an image unto the
[1:53:24] beast. As the Bible said, building a
[1:53:27] Christian economy that close the doors
[1:53:30] of this church and other like it see
[1:53:34] Lucifer at his
[1:53:37] work. Sometimes people this in or we are
[1:53:40] not to judge them but the prophet has
[1:53:44] come in our
[1:53:46] generation that there are people that
[1:53:48] instead of worshiping God they are
[1:53:50] worshiping Satan in these last days.
[1:53:53] Amen.
[1:53:55] Because Satan is the god of this evil
[1:53:57] age. Without knowing it, they thought
[1:54:00] that they are worshiping God. But they
[1:54:02] are worshiping devil instead because the
[1:54:06] only work true worshipper are those who
[1:54:09] receive the message of the hour in this
[1:54:11] last day. Many will be deceived in these
[1:54:14] last days.
[1:54:16] If their name is not written in the book
[1:54:18] of life will be deceived.
[1:54:20] [Music]
[1:54:22] But for you and I, the mighty angel of
[1:54:25] revelation come down with an open book,
[1:54:29] the book of redemption and called your
[1:54:31] name. Thank you, Lord. Revealing to you
[1:54:34] the mystery of your life in the book and
[1:54:38] watch the way you receive your name
[1:54:41] being called.
[1:54:43] Hallelujah. We are the only true
[1:54:46] worshipper of God. Amen. And God could
[1:54:49] not be called God without you.
[1:54:52] Because God is an object of worship.
[1:54:55] Hallelujah. So I'm trying to bring you
[1:54:58] to the three-fold revelation or mystery
[1:55:00] of God. What did they do? Sold out to
[1:55:03] reasoning of wisdom and education like
[1:55:06] Eve did. Fallen angels did. Wesley was a
[1:55:10] man of God. But what followed him?
[1:55:14] Fallen angels got into it. What was the
[1:55:17] first created being of God but fell for
[1:55:21] Lucifer's wisdom? Fell for Lucifer
[1:55:23] wisdom. And you see what they become?
[1:55:26] Fallen angels, an
[1:55:30] organization from men of God who has
[1:55:33] went forth to establish truth in the
[1:55:35] earth before the truth could go on and
[1:55:37] proclamate and get all real revelation
[1:55:40] of Christ. fallen angels come in and
[1:55:42] took it over and made denominations out
[1:55:45] of it.
[1:55:47] The fallen angels coming in, give them
[1:55:50] knowledge, give them wisdom, give them
[1:55:53] [Music]
[1:55:56] uh denominational schools, educate
[1:56:01] them, fallen
[1:56:04] angels. But praise God, we have a mighty
[1:56:07] angel of Revelation 10:1 coming down.
[1:56:12] Hallelujah. And that's the reason the
[1:56:14] revelation of the seven seal mystery had
[1:56:17] to be unfolded. Now you see what they
[1:56:20] left off. If Luther would have went on,
[1:56:22] it had been here. If Wesley would have
[1:56:25] went on, if Pentecostal would have went
[1:56:27] on, what would they have done? Now
[1:56:30] there's only one thing can happen. There
[1:56:32] has to be a message at the end time
[1:56:35] when there is nothing else can follow
[1:56:38] it. And now the economical world has set
[1:56:41] up such a regime that there can be no
[1:56:44] denominations and no not nothing else
[1:56:47] follow it. You're either in it or you're
[1:56:51] not in it. There's no denomination after
[1:56:54] this message. Either you are in it or
[1:56:57] out of it.
[1:56:59] Either you are elected or not elected.
[1:57:02] This is the point of no return. Either
[1:57:05] you are on God or not of God.
[1:57:10] [Music]
[1:57:13] The fruit is in the top of the tree and
[1:57:16] the light is shining on that
[1:57:17] predestinated fruit and she is
[1:57:20] ripening into Christlike fruit. Amen.
[1:57:24] What he's talking about? He's talking
[1:57:25] about the bride. Yes, we are now
[1:57:28] ripening. We we are growing into
[1:57:30] maturity of the word of God. Amen. We

[1:57:39] Lord, leave us higher.
[1:57:41] Bring us higher into your presence,
[1:57:43] Lord.
[1:57:45] As he is ripening into Christlike fruit,
[1:57:48] bringing forth the same melanist and
[1:57:51] sweetness and the same spirit that he
[1:57:54] had in him.
[1:57:56] Hope you see it.

[1:58:03] The same spirit that dwell in
[1:58:05] Christ that fulfill the scripture
[1:58:08] pertaining to his life is also to be in
[1:58:11] us to fulfill scriptures pertaining to
[1:58:16] the bride of his hour. Lord, shall we
[1:58:19] stand?
[1:58:23] So when we see these mockers and
[1:58:24] scabbers disobedient to the
[1:58:28] word and
[1:58:30] gains arise in this hour, we know that
[1:58:33] we are in a season of prophecy that
[1:58:36] cannot be reversed.
[1:58:39] The scripture must be fulfilled. Amen.
[1:58:43] It cannot be erased. It cannot be
[1:58:45] reversed. There will be a there will be
[1:58:48] a
[1:58:50] bride that will manifest in this last
[1:58:52] day. We know that the soon resurrection
[1:58:55] must take place and the promise of the
[1:58:57] body change must be fulfilled just as
[1:59:00] Abraham and Sarah were turned back young
[1:59:04] again. I'm looking forward to it. Amen.
[1:59:09] And are you looking forward to that?
[1:59:12] Amen. We are looking for the promise of
[1:59:14] a body change. That's right. We have
[1:59:18] already stepping in the progress of the
[1:59:20] word of God. There is no turning back.
[1:59:24] We are walking by the revealed word of
[1:59:27] the hour. There is no turning back.
[1:59:30] Because the bride must fulfill the
[1:59:32] scripture that he is predestinated to
[1:59:35] fulfill.
[1:59:37] Amen. And there's no turning back. Amen.
[1:59:40] Hallelujah. And when God give us the
[1:59:42] seal of his holy spirit, it cannot be
[1:59:45] unsealed
[1:59:48] because it will seal you until the day
[1:59:51] of your redemption. Let us comfort one
[1:59:54] another with his word.
[1:59:56] The sure word of prophecy is being made
[1:59:59] manifest in our day. God bless you.
[2:00:03] Amen.
