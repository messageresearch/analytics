[57:01] Holy
[57:03] Scripture and father we know that this
[57:05] is a closed book it is not for every eye
[57:09] to see though if you have education you
[57:12] can
[57:13] read but except that God give us the
[57:16] Revelation beyond that ability of
[57:20] reading we would miss what you have us
[57:23] to to see therefore father anoint us
[57:26] with the isv of the Holy Spirit Come and
[57:30] speak to our hearts touch Our Lives set
[57:33] every captive free those that are sick
[57:37] may you heal them those that are bound
[57:40] may they be set free those that are
[57:43] discouraged may they be encouraged
[57:46] father each and every one your word will
[57:48] go forth and it will not return void but
[57:52] it shall accomplish father we thank you
[57:55] we praise you for the victory before the
[57:58] battle even in Jesus Christ's
[58:01] name amen amen amen God bless you thank
[58:05] you musicians each and everyone God
[58:08] bless you it's just remain standing turn
[58:10] with me to the book of Hebrews chapter 5
[58:13] Hebrews chapter 5 and we'll read verses
[58:17] 11-4
[58:26] I'm going to put these glasses on to
[58:28] help me to see here
[58:30] so yeah yeah
[58:35] okay Hebrews
[58:38] 5:1 of whom we have many things to say
[58:43] and hard to be uttered seeing you're
[58:44] dull of
[58:46] hearing for when for the time you ought
[58:49] to be
[58:50] teachers you have need that one teach
[58:52] you again which be the first principles
[58:55] of the oral Les of God and are become
[58:58] such as have need of milk and not of
[59:00] strong meat for everyone that uses milk
[59:04] is unskillful in the word of
[59:07] righteousness for he is a
[59:10] babe but strong meat belongeth to them
[59:14] that are of full age even those who by
[59:19] reason of views you catch that who
[59:26] by reason of use have their senses
[59:30] exercised to discern both good and
[59:35] evil may God bless the reading of his
[59:37] word you may be seated this morning turn
[59:40] with me if you would to the book of
[59:42] First John chapter 4 then we'll go to
[59:46] Revelation Chapter
[59:48] 2 1 John
[59:50] 4 and we'll read just the first verse
[59:54] beloved
[59:56] believe not every
[59:59] Spirit but try the spirits whether they
[1:00:02] are of
[1:00:03] God because many false prophets are gone
[1:00:07] out into the
[1:00:09] world turn with me to Revelation 2 and
[1:00:13] verse
[1:00:17] two I Know Thy works and thy
[1:00:21] labor and thy
[1:00:24] patience how thou can not hear
[1:00:28] them excuse me how thou cast not bear
[1:00:33] them which are evil and thou Hast tried
[1:00:37] them which say they are Apostles and are
[1:00:41] not and Hast found them
[1:00:45] Liars pretty harsh words but they are
[1:00:49] true
[1:00:51] nonetheless may God add the blessing to
[1:00:54] his word this morning I want to speak to
[1:00:58] you this may be a two or three-part
[1:01:01] series we'll see how the Lord
[1:01:03] leads but I want to title the sermon
[1:01:07] this morning trying the spirits within
[1:01:10] the
[1:01:13] message
[1:01:15] trying the spirits within the
[1:01:19] message and I want to take as a subject
[1:01:23] this morning of the Discerning of
[1:01:31] Spirits it's a quite a deep subject and
[1:01:35] it's something that each one of you are
[1:01:37] going to have to
[1:01:39] do God requires this of each one of you
[1:01:42] not only to get Revelation but have
[1:01:45] discernment of what's being
[1:01:48] said and then the scripture says to try
[1:01:52] the spirits to see whether they're of
[1:01:53] God I want to ask you how do you try the
[1:01:58] spirit it is by the
[1:02:01] word so you do not try them by the
[1:02:06] anointing you do not try them by the
[1:02:09] signs and wonders following them you do
[1:02:11] not TR you only try them by the word of
[1:02:15] God that is our
[1:02:19] absolute that is the irum Thum of
[1:02:22] today you do not try them on how well
[1:02:25] they can quote the
[1:02:27] scripture nor do you try them on how
[1:02:30] anointed their Ministries are nor by the
[1:02:33] signs that
[1:02:36] follow but you try their lives and see
[1:02:40] if how they live matches up to the word
[1:02:42] of God or not there are many people that
[1:02:45] tell you oh I'm a Christian but watch
[1:02:48] their
[1:02:50] life Jesus
[1:02:52] said they honth me with their lips
[1:02:56] but their hearts be far from me in vain
[1:02:59] do they worship
[1:03:02] me I want all of you to start use by by
[1:03:06] reason of
[1:03:08] use start Discerning Spirits
[1:03:15] Amen brother Brenham says things I don't
[1:03:18] care how much a person
[1:03:21] will um say they're a holy ghost filled
[1:03:25] Christian
[1:03:26] he said watch the fruits in their lives
[1:03:29] it'll tell you whether or not they have
[1:03:31] the Holy Spirit because the holy spirit
[1:03:34] will say Amen to all the word and not
[1:03:37] just verbally but it will apply the word
[1:03:40] in the life so the life will manifest
[1:03:43] what the holy spirit's revealing amen
[1:03:48] Amen brother Ram said If a woman still
[1:03:51] cuts her hair and the Bible says that a
[1:03:54] woman should not cut her hair says she
[1:03:56] cannot have the Holy
[1:03:58] Spirit is that
[1:04:00] clear you can't get any more clearer
[1:04:02] than that brother Bram said look he said
[1:04:04] what would make a young girl cut her
[1:04:06] hair he says an
[1:04:09] ungodly evil spirit of the end time yes
[1:04:12] sir he because be because her hair is
[1:04:14] given to her for her glory yes sir and
[1:04:17] he said if she cuts her hair she
[1:04:19] dishonors her head which is Christ amen
[1:04:23] so brother Brandon began to show us
[1:04:25] things start Discerning he says oh my
[1:04:28] how that one Pastor said why my wife is
[1:04:31] she's she's a real Saint and he said oh
[1:04:34] my she came up there and uh you know he
[1:04:37] says I looked at her and she wasn't
[1:04:39] dressed right her hair was chopped off
[1:04:42] and different things and he began to
[1:04:44] look and he said looks more like she's a
[1:04:46] haint than she is a saint cuz she ain't
[1:04:49] got it now what what was he doing he's
[1:04:53] not trying to be smart
[1:04:55] he's not trying to be judgmental he's
[1:04:57] looking at a tree by its
[1:04:59] fruit now I'm not one of these guys who
[1:05:04] can go and look at citrus trees and
[1:05:06] until it bears fruit is it a lemon tree
[1:05:08] is it a grapefruit is it an orange tree
[1:05:12] I don't know but I will know you give a
[1:05:15] few months down the road and I look and
[1:05:17] I see an orange Ah that's an orange tree
[1:05:20] how do I know it's orange it's got
[1:05:22] orange
[1:05:24] fruit even Brother David McGary and I
[1:05:27] years ago and he was preaching and he
[1:05:30] says if it swims like a duck if it
[1:05:33] quacks like a duck if it flies like a
[1:05:36] duck and you know duck duck duck he says
[1:05:39] what is it it's a
[1:05:42] duck now that may sound a little funny
[1:05:45] but it's
[1:05:46] true and so you recognize everything by
[1:05:50] characteristics so you start
[1:05:53] Discerning the spirits that are are
[1:05:55] within the church and I want to clarify
[1:05:58] this because much of the time you have
[1:06:01] certain quotes that are quoted by many
[1:06:03] of the ministers within the message but
[1:06:06] they fail they
[1:06:08] overemphasize certain parts of that
[1:06:10] quote and leave off the rest now Paul
[1:06:13] said I don't want to shun to declare any
[1:06:17] of the word of God to you in other words
[1:06:19] I want to tell you the whole truth
[1:06:24] amen and
[1:06:26] um so let's take this one quote and
[1:06:29] dissect it for just a moment so that you
[1:06:32] understand the direction in which I'm
[1:06:34] taking
[1:06:35] this this is the church age book page 15
[1:06:39] paragraph 3 now
[1:06:40] remember this that Christ is the in the
[1:06:44] true church is a continuation of the
[1:06:46] book of
[1:06:47] Acts but the Book of Revelation shows
[1:06:51] how that the Antichrist Spirit would
[1:06:53] come into the church and defile it
[1:06:55] making it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[1:06:58] it exposes Satan revealing his Works
[1:07:01] attempted destruction of God's
[1:07:04] people and the discrediting of God's
[1:07:08] word right down to the time that he is
[1:07:11] cast into the Lake of
[1:07:13] Fire he fights that he cannot stand
[1:07:18] it he knows that if the people get the
[1:07:21] true revelation of the true
[1:07:24] church now notice that if the people get
[1:07:27] the true revelation of the true church
[1:07:30] so there's a true church and a true
[1:07:34] Revelation but if that is true there is
[1:07:36] also a false church with false
[1:07:39] Revelation okay so if the true church
[1:07:42] gets a true
[1:07:45] Revelation
[1:07:47] okay
[1:07:49] um of the chur and what she is and what
[1:07:52] she stands for and that she can do the
[1:07:55] Greater
[1:07:57] Works she will be an invincible
[1:08:00] Army if they get a true revelation of
[1:08:04] the now here's the point I'm I'm
[1:08:07] making here's where you need to start
[1:08:09] Discerning stuff everything the Glitters
[1:08:11] Is Not
[1:08:13] Gold just because they hang a shingle
[1:08:16] out Malachi 4 Revelations
[1:08:20] 107 and they say they believe the
[1:08:22] message
[1:08:26] how often we Embrace everybody we bring
[1:08:28] everybody right into the circle yeah
[1:08:30] brother right on
[1:08:32] brother you believe this
[1:08:35] message well I want you to understand
[1:08:39] that not everything and everybody that
[1:08:43] says they believes this message say only
[1:08:45] what that Prophet said brother Bram said
[1:08:48] I can tell you that many of those who go
[1:08:51] out and began to preach he said they
[1:08:54] begin to add to and take away from the
[1:08:56] word of God and the word of God no
[1:08:58] longer becomes pure it becomes
[1:09:01] hybrid and when it does it no longer has
[1:09:04] the strength to bring forth of its own
[1:09:09] kind so now watch here's where the point
[1:09:12] I'm getting
[1:09:14] to if they get a true revelation of the
[1:09:17] two Spirits say two two Spirits every
[1:09:21] Revival brings forth what twins
[1:09:26] amen it's amazing how many people I go
[1:09:28] to a restaurant I go we had a physical
[1:09:32] therapist coming to my house yesterday
[1:09:33] said do I know you looking at me she
[1:09:37] came to do physical therapy for Sandy on
[1:09:39] her arm do you do I know you I said no
[1:09:43] no yeah I know you I said well you
[1:09:45] probably know my twin brother Don oh
[1:09:48] yeah
[1:09:49] yeah every
[1:09:53] Revival brings forth twins they look
[1:09:59] alike within the framework of the church
[1:10:02] so we're not talking about Catholic
[1:10:06] we're not talking about Lutheran
[1:10:09] Pentecostal within somebody say within
[1:10:13] that's within the framework of the
[1:10:16] Church of the Christian church and by
[1:10:19] God's spirit what is it what do you do
[1:10:22] with God's spirit
[1:10:23] discern so now here here we're talking
[1:10:25] about you get a true revelation of the
[1:10:28] true church and you begin to see two
[1:10:30] Spirits were working within the
[1:10:32] framework of the Christian church and by
[1:10:35] God's spirit you
[1:10:38] discern so you first catch something by
[1:10:41] discernment and the Bible excuse me the
[1:10:45] message says and withstand the
[1:10:47] Antichrist
[1:10:48] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:10:53] her amen
[1:10:56] amen
[1:10:58] now a lot of
[1:11:01] times you see different ones stating
[1:11:04] that Satan is a defeated enemy and he is
[1:11:10] but you better know spiritual
[1:11:13] warfare because you will meet
[1:11:16] him you will have to have spiritual
[1:11:19] warfare and you'll have to put on the
[1:11:21] whole armor of God and you better start
[1:11:23] Discerning spirits within the framework
[1:11:26] of the
[1:11:27] church don't Embrace anybody and
[1:11:29] everybody and
[1:11:31] everything try the spirits and see
[1:11:34] whether or not they are of
[1:11:36] God now brother Brenham says I'm going
[1:11:40] to tell you some of these things by the
[1:11:43] experience that he went through now let
[1:11:45] me give you an example and I'm going to
[1:11:47] ask you a
[1:11:48] question the loud you see in church age
[1:11:51] began in what year
[1:11:58] 1906 why did he choose
[1:12:01] 1906 ausa street because the Holy
[1:12:07] Spirit remember the oneeyed black man
[1:12:10] brother Seymour I think it was in isusa
[1:12:12] Street and they begin to call on the
[1:12:13] Lord begin to ask God the the the Holy
[1:12:16] Spirit fell in isusa Street and it was a
[1:12:19] great Revival gifts and and tongues and
[1:12:23] prophecies and all kinds of stuff and
[1:12:25] man it just went like like wildfire so
[1:12:29] 1906 is when loud eia started and it
[1:12:33] started because of a movement of the
[1:12:36] Holy Spirit and brother Brenan was born
[1:12:39] in what year 1909 so the spirit was
[1:12:44] already anointing an age and people and
[1:12:47] gifts and
[1:12:49] Ministries before he even became a
[1:12:53] preacher so now when God begins to give
[1:12:56] him a word because he's the angel to the
[1:12:59] Church of
[1:13:01] leasa are we together on that so now all
[1:13:05] of this teaching about anointings and
[1:13:08] gifts and callings and doing God a
[1:13:11] service all of these things the prophet
[1:13:14] of God has to now wean us away from all
[1:13:17] of the things that we had been
[1:13:20] taught okay and when he put the church
[1:13:24] in order when he began to actually have
[1:13:28] accountability for gifts and prophecies
[1:13:31] he ye my people I will bless you and on
[1:13:34] and on and and tongues and
[1:13:36] interpretation and and while he's yet
[1:13:39] speaking how many times have you heard a
[1:13:41] service brother Bram is preaching even
[1:13:43] in one one tape uh brother bram's going
[1:13:48] in and then Here Comes an interpretation
[1:13:52] and a man probably the host Pastor
[1:13:54] excuse EXC me excuse
[1:13:56] me brother brenham's not done
[1:14:04] yet you see that Discerning of
[1:14:08] spirits but many people are not taught
[1:14:11] correctly they just went ahead and
[1:14:14] brother BR said yes brandom Tabernacle
[1:14:15] I'd let you play with the gifts now for
[1:14:17] over 20 years I'm going to set them in
[1:14:20] order now you got a gift of tongues I
[1:14:22] want you to come before church in the
[1:14:23] back room sit down with we got those who
[1:14:25] got interpretation of tongues and we got
[1:14:28] those who are who have got Discerning
[1:14:30] spirits and word of knowledge and we got
[1:14:32] Elders who will judge us so you want to
[1:14:35] speak in tongues you want to interpret
[1:14:37] it and you write it down and he says and
[1:14:39] then you got three to judge
[1:14:41] it is this do you feel you're an elder
[1:14:45] in the church do you feel yes sir I that
[1:14:47] was thus sayith the Lord so then you go
[1:14:49] ahead and you read it now remember
[1:14:51] brother Bram said a a tongues an
[1:14:53] interpretation brings a prophecy and a
[1:14:56] prophecy is what it's not well-wishing
[1:14:59] it's not repeating scripture it's not
[1:15:02] saying oh if you will seek the Lord I
[1:15:04] will bless you if you do this I will no
[1:15:07] we know that prophecy is for telling a
[1:15:11] future event don't go home by way of I17
[1:15:15] this evening because there's going to be
[1:15:16] a terrible wreck and people will lose
[1:15:19] their
[1:15:21] lives okay and so do believe that and so
[1:15:26] they would sign it and so they read it
[1:15:27] but he says now what
[1:15:29] happens if it doesn't come to pass
[1:15:33] there's no
[1:15:36] reck he said now for he that spoke in
[1:15:39] tongues he that interpreted it and the
[1:15:42] three Elders that signed to it you know
[1:15:44] what sit
[1:15:46] down cuz you've got a false Spirit among
[1:15:49] you cuz you said God said it and he and
[1:15:52] it didn't come to pass
[1:15:55] now when brother Brenham began to set
[1:15:57] the gifts in order guess what nobody
[1:16:00] wanted to be
[1:16:02] judged because who who Who's going to
[1:16:06] judge me well you going to make me step
[1:16:08] down yes sir why CU you got a false
[1:16:11] Spirit on you the Bible says try the
[1:16:14] spirits and see whether or not they are
[1:16:16] of
[1:16:21] God so now brother Brenham now comes
[1:16:24] comes
[1:16:25] in as a missionary
[1:16:28] baptist he's not really been around much
[1:16:31] of a what is called a Pentecostal
[1:16:33] movement and he stops somewhere I think
[1:16:36] in Mishiwaka somewhere and there's a
[1:16:38] revival going on he goes in there and
[1:16:40] wow my he said if I ever saw people
[1:16:43] happy about what they believe that
[1:16:46] impressed him
[1:16:48] first people should be able to see that
[1:16:50] we enjoy going to church cuz if we don't
[1:16:54] have or Make a Joyful Noise on the Lord
[1:16:57] who's going to want what you
[1:16:58] got when we all get to heaven what a day
[1:17:04] yeah you ain't happy about nothing one
[1:17:07] time you get happy is let's stand the
[1:17:08] service is over you're dismissed
[1:17:11] Hallelujah
[1:17:14] Resurrection you come back to life CU
[1:17:16] you
[1:17:19] slept
[1:17:21] amen okay so now brother Brenham is
[1:17:24] there in that eting you get tongues and
[1:17:26] interpretation and wow he is saying this
[1:17:30] is amazing these are angels so now he's
[1:17:34] got a gift in the hand is that correct
[1:17:36] God giv gift lays his hand on somebody
[1:17:38] and he could tell Oh my he said I talked
[1:17:40] to the first one shook his hand if I
[1:17:42] ever met a true Christian that was him
[1:17:45] man you know love God he could tell by
[1:17:47] the sincerity and everything and then he
[1:17:49] said I went and talked to the other man
[1:17:51] I I shook his hand he said oh my he's
[1:17:54] married to a blond-haired woman got or a
[1:17:57] blackheaded and got children by a
[1:18:00] blond-headed
[1:18:01] woman oh now now oh wait just a second
[1:18:05] now he's Discerning spirits but he says
[1:18:10] I thought I was among Angels now I may
[1:18:13] be among Devils God you need to help me
[1:18:16] to
[1:18:17] understand because I don't understand I
[1:18:20] know the rain falls on the just and the
[1:18:23] unjust and so now he goes a prophet goes
[1:18:27] uh and he seeks God and he gets in his
[1:18:29] cave he's been in the cave for a few
[1:18:32] days he's asking God what is about all
[1:18:34] this anointing he said I'm out on my uh
[1:18:37] a little tree uh falling over trunk and
[1:18:41] he says there I'm reading my Bible and
[1:18:43] he says and I set it down for a moment
[1:18:46] to just kind of meditate and the wind
[1:18:48] blew it over to Hebrews
[1:18:51] 11 he said now that's strange I was
[1:18:54] wasn't reading Hebrews 11 so he takes
[1:18:56] his Bible goes back puts it down the
[1:18:59] wind blows it
[1:19:01] again is that
[1:19:05] Supernatural and it happens a couple
[1:19:08] times until they realize okay God are
[1:19:09] you trying to show me
[1:19:12] something and he says does not the rain
[1:19:14] fall on the just and the unjust both the
[1:19:17] cockle bur and the r and the wheat raise
[1:19:20] up and praise the Lord so he says look
[1:19:23] oh my there's where brother Brenham
[1:19:25] takes a sermon called the anointed ones
[1:19:28] of the end time and he says they are
[1:19:32] genuinely anointed of the Holy Spirit
[1:19:35] they are activating gifts of the Spirit
[1:19:38] but he says in wrong
[1:19:41] seed now that's amazing now I remember
[1:19:44] the first several times that I heard the
[1:19:46] anointed ones at the end time I thought
[1:19:48] that he would say the anointing is false
[1:19:51] it's false anointing on false seed no he
[1:19:55] said genuine anointing genuine Holy
[1:19:58] Spirit falling upon even nonseed
[1:20:01] activating gifts of the Spirit he said
[1:20:04] but watch the control tower Christ is
[1:20:07] not sitting on the control tower
[1:20:10] therefore they could activate the gifts
[1:20:12] of the Spirit for there are gifts of the
[1:20:14] Spirit speaking in tongues
[1:20:16] interpretation of tongues on on and on
[1:20:19] huh those are the gifts of the Spirit do
[1:20:21] you know Caiaphas
[1:20:23] prophesied wasn't filled with the Holy
[1:20:25] Ghost nor did he not see Christ but he
[1:20:28] prophesied I want you to understand a
[1:20:30] lot of times these gifts of the Spirit
[1:20:33] and I want to ask you a question the
[1:20:34] Bible says gifts and
[1:20:37] callings are without repentance you had
[1:20:39] a gift if you got a gift in your life
[1:20:42] right now you've always had it but what
[1:20:45] happened is you come to the knowledge
[1:20:47] you got it I had a friend of mine tell
[1:20:50] me he said I used to I was a bartender
[1:20:52] before I got converted he said men had
[1:20:54] come to my bar and they'd sit down and I
[1:20:56] never would ask them what is it you want
[1:20:59] and he says I would mix their drink set
[1:21:01] it in front of them and they said how
[1:21:03] did you know what he said I don't know I
[1:21:05] just knew they wanted Whiskey and Rye or
[1:21:08] whatever some kind of mixed drink and he
[1:21:11] says brother Brenham said you had that
[1:21:14] gift before you got converted he said
[1:21:16] now don't play around with it because
[1:21:18] it's not
[1:21:22] 100% has a margin of in it now so I'm
[1:21:28] saying all of that to bring us now to
[1:21:31] watch what brother Brenham says by
[1:21:33] experience I'm going to do some reading
[1:21:35] here let me put these glasses back on so
[1:21:38] I can read it a little bit better lotan
[1:21:41] Church age page
[1:21:43] 347 then there is all this talk about
[1:21:46] the
[1:21:47] gelia supposed to be the evidence of the
[1:21:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost and people are
[1:21:53] thinking that we are in theid
[1:21:55] of a great Revival Revival is
[1:21:58] over America had her last chance in
[1:22:03] 1957 now the tongues are God's sign of
[1:22:06] impending
[1:22:08] disaster look at that everybody's
[1:22:10] talking about talking in tongues brother
[1:22:12] Bram said tongues is not for the
[1:22:14] believer it's for the unbeliever and he
[1:22:18] says you know what it's a sign of
[1:22:20] impending disaster
[1:22:26] even as they
[1:22:27] were when they appeared upon the wall at
[1:22:30] B Bel sher's
[1:22:33] Feast then brother B quotes Matthew 7:22
[1:22:37] and 23 depart from me ye that work
[1:22:40] iniquity I never knew
[1:22:42] you Jesus said they were workers of
[1:22:45] iniquity now what is
[1:22:47] Iniquity knowing what's
[1:22:50] right and not doing it you can know what
[1:22:54] what's
[1:22:55] right and not do it the Bible says be
[1:22:58] not hearers only but doers of the
[1:23:05] word you can get a man that can come and
[1:23:08] pray for the sick get oil and blood
[1:23:10] appearing in the congregation
[1:23:13] prophesy coming forth and all manner of
[1:23:17] the Supernatural and the people will
[1:23:19] gather around him and swear that he is
[1:23:21] of the Lord even though he's actually
[1:23:23] making a money racket of religion and
[1:23:25] living in sin the only answer they have
[1:23:29] is the absolutely unbiblical answer of
[1:23:31] well he gets results so he must be of
[1:23:35] God how terrible how actually poor this
[1:23:38] age is in the spirit of God and the poor
[1:23:42] poverty stricken ones don't even know it
[1:23:45] God help us then to have spiritual
[1:23:51] discernment brother Brenham says false
[1:23:54] prophets and false teachers will
[1:23:57] arise he says watch seducers will wax
[1:24:00] worse and worse they it will come into
[1:24:03] the church now usually it always happens
[1:24:07] after the messenger goes off the scene
[1:24:10] because it gets much worse but it was
[1:24:12] happening with him
[1:24:14] here was already happening so I want to
[1:24:17] ask
[1:24:18] you after God sends a messenger with his
[1:24:22] word every generation gets a little bit
[1:24:27] uh more starchy a little bit less away
[1:24:29] from the fire Revival and after about
[1:24:32] the fourth generation he said you have
[1:24:34] to Resto the fire again because the fire
[1:24:37] is about ready to go
[1:24:38] out so you have to understand we're
[1:24:41] fighting things now right now that we've
[1:24:44] never faced before because now different
[1:24:47] ones are rising up just like it did in
[1:24:51] the first church age amen
[1:24:54] now here's resume of the church Ages
[1:24:59] page
[1:25:00] 377 this age started just after the turn
[1:25:04] of the 20th
[1:25:05] century as it will be as it was to the
[1:25:11] age in which the true church would
[1:25:13] return to bring the bride she was at
[1:25:17] Pentecost we know that there must be of
[1:25:19] necessity be a return of dynamic
[1:25:22] power the believer sensed this and their
[1:25:25] Spirits began crying to God for a new
[1:25:28] outpouring such as was in the first
[1:25:31] century what seemed to be the answer
[1:25:34] came as many began to speak in tongues
[1:25:37] and manifest the gifts of the
[1:25:39] Spirit it was then believed this was
[1:25:43] indeed the long awaited
[1:25:46] restoration it was
[1:25:48] not for the latter Reign can come only
[1:25:52] after the former Reign which is the
[1:25:54] spring or teaching rain the latter rain
[1:25:57] then is the Harvest rain how could this
[1:26:01] be the real thing when the teaching rign
[1:26:05] had not come now watch the prophet
[1:26:08] messenger who was sent to teach the
[1:26:10] people and turned the hearts of the
[1:26:12] children back to the Pentecostals
[1:26:15] fathers had not yet come thus what was
[1:26:19] thought to be the restoration and final
[1:26:22] quickening unto the rapture had not
[1:26:25] come in it watch this in it was a
[1:26:29] mixture of unrighteous
[1:26:31] partaking of spiritual blessing and
[1:26:34] manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we have
[1:26:37] kept pointing out to
[1:26:39] you in it also was devil power as men
[1:26:44] were under the control of devils yet no
[1:26:48] one seem to realize
[1:26:50] it then to prove that it was not the
[1:26:53] real
[1:26:55] these people even before a second
[1:26:58] generation had appeared
[1:27:01] organized wrote their unscriptural
[1:27:04] doctrines built their fences as every
[1:27:08] other group ahead of them did now I want
[1:27:09] you to understand what they do they
[1:27:12] organize brother BM said this message
[1:27:16] will never
[1:27:17] denominate but I'm going to shock you
[1:27:20] there are people in the message that
[1:27:22] have denominated
[1:27:24] they have organized it's us for and no
[1:27:26] more it's us if you don't believe us you
[1:27:28] don't believe our church you're out of
[1:27:29] here and next thing you know it you can
[1:27:32] talk to them and you get the feeling
[1:27:34] from them you start Discerning their
[1:27:36] spirit and you feel like it's them and
[1:27:40] us it's not us together they make you
[1:27:44] feel like well it's
[1:27:49] you and we're not
[1:27:52] United unscriptural doctrines brings
[1:27:55] Division and fences pretty soon you
[1:27:58] can't Fellowship one with another why
[1:28:00] well you don't see it just exactly like
[1:28:02] I do I'm sick of
[1:28:05] that I am I'm so sick of the politics
[1:28:09] within the
[1:28:10] message
[1:28:11] really and you know who's the worst
[1:28:15] ministers yeah
[1:28:18] yeah it is the truth and I'm sorry to
[1:28:21] say that but it is the truth and I can
[1:28:27] understand why some just say I'm staying
[1:28:30] home and just listening to a
[1:28:33] tape I understand some of that
[1:28:36] technology that understanding I say yeah
[1:28:40] I'm because you know what but just
[1:28:43] because you have the bad ones don't
[1:28:46] throw the baby out with the bathwater
[1:28:49] there are true God sent God called God
[1:28:51] ordained Ministry
[1:28:56] am you know who may close your
[1:28:59] door message
[1:29:01] Believers you know you know who may take
[1:29:04] away you going to
[1:29:09] church I'm I'm going to tell you
[1:29:11] something I was at brandom Tabernacle
[1:29:12] here three weeks
[1:29:14] ago I getting a tour of the Tabernacle
[1:29:17] and you talk about a sad
[1:29:21] situation here the church
[1:29:25] which was the home Church of the prophet
[1:29:27] of God where he stored up spiritual food
[1:29:29] where the moving of God where the angel
[1:29:32] rode on the back wall On and On signs
[1:29:35] and wonders
[1:29:39] everywhere you have to get permission
[1:29:42] for somebody to open the door come in
[1:29:44] and you open it's just a
[1:29:50] museum there's nobody preaching
[1:29:54] and in order to go to church to pray you
[1:29:57] have to sign up
[1:29:58] online and you can't pray out
[1:30:02] loud it's
[1:30:05] ridiculous and so this brother is giving
[1:30:07] us a a little tour and he says you know
[1:30:09] what I feel sorry for you people that go
[1:30:12] to
[1:30:15] church excuse me yeah I feel sorry for
[1:30:19] you people that go to church cuz we're
[1:30:21] in church all the time you know what you
[1:30:24] go to church two hours Sunday two two
[1:30:26] hours this is what he said two hours
[1:30:28] Sunday you go to church two hours Sunday
[1:30:30] evening and two hours Wednesday night
[1:30:32] we're in church
[1:30:34] 247 our home is our
[1:30:38] church I want to ask you is that brother
[1:30:40] bren's
[1:30:45] teaching and
[1:30:47] yet they closed the doors of Brenham
[1:30:49] Tabernacle four years ago they closed
[1:30:52] the doors to voice of God God recorded
[1:30:54] you know they don't
[1:30:56] print they don't make tapes and they
[1:30:59] don't make the tablet no
[1:31:00] more and
[1:31:02] so brother Daniel Andes him and Shannon
[1:31:06] took us by there said you want to okay
[1:31:09] so
[1:31:11] anyway well let me go back to what the
[1:31:14] brother said there because he said you
[1:31:16] you people you know you have only a
[1:31:18] couple times a week that you and we're
[1:31:20] here in church you know 247
[1:31:24] I said do you think you will ever open
[1:31:26] the doors again he said no he said
[1:31:30] Brother Joseph brandham said the best
[1:31:32] thing that ever happened to the message
[1:31:34] was
[1:31:37] covid-19 well I just beg to differ with
[1:31:40] you covid-19 was not the best
[1:31:43] thing but what his Viewpoint is cause
[1:31:46] you to stay home
[1:31:48] isolate and to stay home and press
[1:31:51] play what are your kids going to to do
[1:31:54] if you do that your kids are going to
[1:31:56] fellowship with
[1:31:58] somebody yeah yeah and so
[1:32:04] anyway he said we're probably never you
[1:32:08] know it says on there they're they've
[1:32:09] been closed for remodeling how long does
[1:32:12] it take there ain't nobody working
[1:32:14] there's no remodel work going on so
[1:32:17] Daniel took us by Daniel Andes took us
[1:32:19] by voice of God so we went there and we
[1:32:23] parked right in front there wasn't
[1:32:24] nobody there a couple cars on the side
[1:32:26] of the building I've never been there I
[1:32:28] have not been to Jeffersonville since
[1:32:31] 1987 wow 87 I've never been there since
[1:32:36] that time so you know I come they go in
[1:32:40] front of the voice of God and they got a
[1:32:42] little Lake out front how many of you
[1:32:44] ever been by the the new building raise
[1:32:46] your hand a few of you yeah so we by get
[1:32:49] a little Lake out front sign on there no
[1:32:52] fishing I asked Daniel do you have a
[1:32:55] fishing
[1:32:57] rod I said no this is here's the
[1:33:01] carnality of brother Ron I said if you
[1:33:03] got a fishing rod I want you to take a
[1:33:05] picture of me fishing in this Lake next
[1:33:07] to the sign and I'm going to send it to
[1:33:09] Brother Joseph and I know he's going to
[1:33:12] laugh I'm not trying to be a rebellious
[1:33:15] no it's funny no no fishing anyway so we
[1:33:19] go to the front door and it's got a sign
[1:33:21] on there due to moding this place is
[1:33:24] closed okay so I'm I walk up I wanted to
[1:33:28] take a close-up picture of closed right

[1:34:14] and so
[1:34:16] anyway even in the Tabernacle the
[1:34:19] brother who gave us the tour Daniel

[1:34:40] great blessing for you to just okay so
[1:34:42] Sandy and I we got our picture and and
[1:34:45] everything but he says uh when we go out
[1:34:47] into the sanctuary nobody goes behind

[1:35:09] you stay home and press play brother Ram
[1:35:13] says you can't wait for those doors to
[1:35:15] be open here's what's nice about a
[1:35:17] living Ministry a god ordained God sent
[1:35:21] because while he's preaching the whole
[1:35:23] holy spirit is speaking to his heart and
[1:35:26] the word is Discerning and somebody's
[1:35:29] sitting right there and how many times
[1:35:31] have you been in church and God gave you
[1:35:34] a word because it was something you were
[1:35:36] praying about or a spirit bothering you
[1:35:39] and all of a sudden the
[1:35:41] spirit speaks through that Minister and
[1:35:44] you knew that was for me man amen who
[1:35:48] told you brother Ron nobody told me he
[1:35:51] told me thank God for alive ordain God
[1:35:55] send
[1:35:57] Ministry
[1:36:03] amen become a
[1:36:07] museum brother BM said one day they'll
[1:36:09] lock the
[1:36:10] doors make it a storehouse you ever been
[1:36:13] into a a house an old building or
[1:36:16] something it's got that musty
[1:36:17] smell you walk
[1:36:20] in that's how the Tabernacle my heart
[1:36:23] heart was broken I thought oh God is
[1:36:27] that would I want to take my
[1:36:30] youth and just view a
[1:36:37] museum
[1:36:39] God is this what the message is coming
[1:36:42] down
[1:36:42] to you just close the doors everybody go
[1:36:45] home you stay in your house nobody
[1:36:47] fellowship with one
[1:36:49] another a nickan spirit now watch start
[1:36:52] Discerning spirits discern Spirits try
[1:36:56] the spirit and
[1:36:57] see a nickan spirit what does it do it
[1:37:03] divides and
[1:37:05] conquers so anything that divides us and
[1:37:10] causes us not to be able to have
[1:37:12] Fellowship is not a Godly
[1:37:15] Spirit hey let the chips fall where they
[1:37:19] may I am here to tell you the truth and
[1:37:22] I'm not trying to be a pastor out here
[1:37:24] on the internet I'm not trying to Pastor
[1:37:27] anybody else's sheep I'm telling my
[1:37:29] sheep because God has ordained me to
[1:37:32] this church and therefore I have a right
[1:37:34] to say what I feel over my Pulpit
[1:37:37] somebody say
[1:37:39] Amen thank
[1:37:43] you in the sermon sir we would see Jesus
[1:37:46] let's go
[1:37:50] on but my precious brother
[1:37:54] you have some poor spiritual
[1:37:57] discernment that's where the church is
[1:38:00] what the church is missing today is that
[1:38:03] spiritual
[1:38:05] discernment to see what God's are
[1:38:08] doing and they
[1:38:10] took and they look way over the top of
[1:38:14] something here that's going on right
[1:38:17] here and it'll be passed before you know
[1:38:22] it so I want to speak on this subject
[1:38:24] because each one of you are going to
[1:38:29] face this and it's going to affect
[1:38:33] you it will affect
[1:38:36] you it will anoint somebody around you
[1:38:39] and make perhaps them to believe it and
[1:38:42] guess what they will all of a sudden
[1:38:45] split away from you and you'll find you
[1:38:47] have no more Fellowship together though
[1:38:49] you quote believe the same message have
[1:38:52] you ever experienced that if you have it
[1:38:55] hang on cuz you
[1:38:59] will there is a spiritual battle going
[1:39:02] on we fight not against flesh and
[1:39:06] blood if you are unaware of spiritual
[1:39:09] warfare if you fail to use your
[1:39:12] spiritual discernment you will be
[1:39:15] vulnerable and susceptible to influence
[1:39:18] of demonic Powers amen that's true you
[1:39:21] will be susceptible to to false Doctrine
[1:39:24] and false
[1:39:27] teachers you will be susceptible to evil
[1:39:30] spirits by sowing of Discord among the
[1:39:33] Brethren which causes Division and roots
[1:39:35] of
[1:39:36] bitterness the Bible tells us to mark
[1:39:39] them which cause division among
[1:39:41] you amen God help us to have discernment
[1:39:46] of
[1:39:47] spirits to
[1:39:50] discern in Greek
[1:39:54] diaro what does it mean to separate to
[1:39:57] make a distinction to
[1:39:59] discriminate to learn by
[1:40:03] discrimination to give judgment to
[1:40:06] decide a
[1:40:08] dispute it also means to contend for the
[1:40:12] truth to discern contend for the
[1:40:17] truth I know many of you are good
[1:40:19] Christian
[1:40:21] people we're trying to live the right
[1:40:23] way according to the word of God but you
[1:40:25] have got got to start using spiritual
[1:40:28] discernment when it comes to the word of
[1:40:31] God that's why the scripture says try
[1:40:34] the spirits to see whether or not they
[1:40:37] are of God use to spiritual
[1:40:41] discernment 2 Corinthians 10: 3-5 for
[1:40:44] though we walk in the
[1:40:47] flesh we do not war after the flesh
[1:40:53] for the weapon of our Warfare are not
[1:40:55] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:40:57] pulling down of strongholds he gives you
[1:41:01] a little smiling Emoji there casting
[1:41:04] down imaginations and every High thing
[1:41:07] that exalteth itself against the
[1:41:09] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:41:12] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[1:41:15] of
[1:41:16] Christ amen Ephesians 6: 10-2 finally my
[1:41:21] brethren be strong in the Lord and then
[1:41:23] power of His might put on the whole
[1:41:25] armor of God that you may be able to
[1:41:27] stand against the Ws of the devil for we
[1:41:31] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:41:33] against principalities against Powers
[1:41:36] against rulers of the darkness of this
[1:41:38] world against spiritual wickedness in
[1:41:41] high places do you know churches carry
[1:41:44] Spirits do you know people carry Spirits
[1:41:49] do you know Ministries carry spirits
[1:41:53] I'm going to give you some quotes here
[1:41:55] but let me just give you an example you
[1:41:58] parents be careful who you let your
[1:42:01] children hang
[1:42:03] around because you might have good Godly
[1:42:06] kids let them hang around a bunch of
[1:42:10] rebels and watch when they come
[1:42:13] home who you've been hanging around
[1:42:20] with what' they do they picked up a
[1:42:22] spirit oh I just I'm just going over to
[1:42:25] Johnny's house I've just gone over to go
[1:42:27] see
[1:42:30] Susie what was it a spirit picked up a
[1:42:37] spirit huh we got to start Discerning
[1:42:43] Spirits it's it's okay I want you to I
[1:42:45] want you to listen it's okay that we
[1:42:47] don't get jumping and shouting because
[1:42:49] this ain't no jumping and shouting
[1:42:51] service right now it may be later it
[1:42:53] might save your life might save your
[1:42:55] family might save your
[1:42:57] kids okay cuz you got to start
[1:42:59] Discerning now we're going to show you
[1:43:01] brother brim says here God keeps his
[1:43:03] word
[1:43:04] 57 now for a little context to go back
[1:43:07] to get a background to the things I want
[1:43:09] to say in reason I've always tried to
[1:43:11] say stay on the Bible I went into
[1:43:14] churches many times amen I went in the
[1:43:17] churches many times he talking about
[1:43:19] experience now brother Freddy he's
[1:43:21] taking his experience experience
[1:43:23] matching it to the word of God and he
[1:43:26] goes into churches many times watch what
[1:43:28] he
[1:43:30] says just so that you get a little
[1:43:32] general picture I've went into churches
[1:43:35] and you watch this you go into a church
[1:43:37] and you'll find usually the way that
[1:43:40] Pastor acts that's the way the
[1:43:42] congregation will act see I believe they
[1:43:45] get one another Spirit instead of the
[1:43:48] Holy Spirit sometimes what' he say
[1:43:53] you might get one another
[1:43:56] Spirit instead of the Holy Spirit watch
[1:44:00] how the pastor
[1:44:05] acts absolutely take a real good woman
[1:44:07] marry her to a no noac account man he'll
[1:44:10] either become a gentleman or she'll
[1:44:11] become a no account see you just take
[1:44:14] one another's
[1:44:16] Spirit you do birds of a
[1:44:21] feather flock together he speaking from
[1:44:23] experience now God keeps his word
[1:44:25] brother Bren I'm going to read the ital
[1:44:28] or the
[1:44:29] highlighted I have went into churches
[1:44:32] and I say this re with reverence now I
[1:44:34] find that many times in the churches I
[1:44:37] believe people get one another Spirit
[1:44:39] instead of the Holy Spirit you go into a
[1:44:41] church and watch where the pastor maybe
[1:44:44] jerks his head the whole congregation
[1:44:47] will do it you go into a church where
[1:44:50] the pastor says he's got oil running
[1:44:52] from his hand hands the first saying you
[1:44:54] know the whole company believes that and
[1:44:56] they have it going to a church where
[1:44:59] there's a lot of dancing and jumping and
[1:45:01] running around I'm not condemning these
[1:45:04] things I'm just speaking as an
[1:45:08] observation to present a point to you if
[1:45:12] you get a pastor that's very emotional
[1:45:15] the whole congregation will be emotional
[1:45:18] you get a pastor that's starch and stiff
[1:45:22] and the whole congregation will be just
[1:45:24] like brother
[1:45:29] Ron I certainly don't want to be starch
[1:45:32] and
[1:45:33] stiffy but I know this the older I get
[1:45:35] the more stiff and
[1:45:39] anyway I I I'm not making a joke out of
[1:45:42] it this is true he says I'm I'm making a
[1:45:45] point here by
[1:45:47] observation
[1:45:48] okay I believe you receive each other's
[1:45:52] spirit
[1:45:57] now brother Bram says in the sermon
[1:45:59] sermon choosing a bride watch this talk
[1:46:01] about choosing a
[1:46:04] church the same applies to choosing a
[1:46:08] church now you must pray over the church
[1:46:12] that you're fellowshipping in remember
[1:46:14] churches carry a
[1:46:18] spirit you guys catch
[1:46:21] that church
[1:46:23] carry the
[1:46:25] spirit now I don't want to be critical I
[1:46:28] realize I'm an old man I got to leave
[1:46:31] here one of these days I got to answer
[1:46:32] at the day of judgment for what I say
[1:46:34] tonight or any other time and I
[1:46:36] therefore I got to be dead Earnest and
[1:46:38] truly convicted but you go into a church
[1:46:40] and you watch the behavior of that
[1:46:42] church you just watch the pastor a while
[1:46:44] and you usually find that the church
[1:46:46] acts like the pastor sometimes I wonder
[1:46:49] if we don't get one another Spirit
[1:46:50] instead of the Holy Spirit
[1:46:54] you get to a place where a pastor is
[1:46:55] real radical and carrying on you find a
[1:46:57] congregation the same way I'll bring you
[1:47:00] to a church where I see the pastor stand
[1:47:02] jerk his head back and forth you watch
[1:47:04] the congregation they do the same thing
[1:47:06] you take a pastor just gulp down
[1:47:08] anything usually the church would do the
[1:47:10] same thing so if I was choosing a church
[1:47:14] I'd choose a genuine fundamental Full
[1:47:16] Gospel Bible Church I choosing one to
[1:47:19] put my family in amen
[1:47:22] you know I've been concerned now for
[1:47:25] probably 15 years of seeing the
[1:47:28] direction some of the ministry are
[1:47:30] taking this
[1:47:32] message concerns me and it's affecting
[1:47:35] mostly the
[1:47:36] youth because youth are
[1:47:39] young they're vulnerable they don't know
[1:47:42] they haven't been there done
[1:47:46] that I believe that some are getting off
[1:47:50] into fanatical elements
[1:47:53] and emotions and
[1:47:55] Sensations and causing all of that to be
[1:47:57] called the Holy Ghost right it is a holy
[1:48:01] ghost
[1:48:02] anointing you understand
[1:48:05] that but what they're doing exactly as
[1:48:09] Pentecost where did Pentecost make their
[1:48:11] mistake brother brand preaches a sermon
[1:48:13] where I believe Pentecost failed why I'm
[1:48:16] against organized religion why we are
[1:48:18] not a
[1:48:20] denomination where did Pentecost fail
[1:48:23] they took some truths and made this this
[1:48:26] is the initial
[1:48:31] evidence what was the initial
[1:48:33] evidence speaking in tongu if you don't
[1:48:36] speak in tongues you don't got
[1:48:39] it then was the Apostle Paul wrong to
[1:48:43] say do all speak with tongues do all
[1:48:46] prophesy do all have the gifts of
[1:48:49] healing Now understand that you got all
[1:48:53] of this stuff that's called this great
[1:48:55] movement the Holy Spirit going and all
[1:48:58] of the many of the young people are just
[1:49:00] taking it in why because you watch the
[1:49:04] way the minister is acting they're going
[1:49:06] to act the same way hallelujah praise be
[1:49:11] to God now I have to be careful because
[1:49:13] you may think I'm trying to imitate
[1:49:18] somebody God forbid no and every church
[1:49:21] is Sovereign amen that's right I don't
[1:49:24] want everybody to be like me no
[1:49:27] way but watch pretty soon they start
[1:49:30] just impersonating one
[1:49:38] another and if you had the Holy
[1:49:41] Ghost praise God he would speak in
[1:49:46] tongues if you had the Holy Ghost the
[1:49:50] next thing you know putting all these
[1:49:51] conditions out here
[1:49:53] instead of you starchy stiff you loudy
[1:49:57] aan and going on and on next thing you
[1:50:00] know you're you're
[1:50:03] judging the other people that are not
[1:50:06] acting the way you act and pretty soon
[1:50:08] it's a
[1:50:10] division it's Us and
[1:50:12] Them did Brother Brenham ever do that
[1:50:16] brother Brenham came to unite this bride
[1:50:18] together around the word hallelujah it
[1:50:22] wasn't he says I'm going to give you
[1:50:24] some quotes here in just a second
[1:50:26] because this is important because you
[1:50:27] got to have spiritual discernment and by
[1:50:32] reason of use you need to exercise it
[1:50:35] what happens to muscles if you put it in
[1:50:38] a cast some of you that that work in a
[1:50:41] hospital what
[1:50:43] happens it atrophies oh oh oh oh don't
[1:50:49] move it don't move
[1:50:51] it a nothing wrong your arm ain't broke
[1:50:54] it's healed up yeah but I I I haven't
[1:50:57] moved it in months well that's the same
[1:51:00] way with your
[1:51:01] atrophied
[1:51:03] discernment you've not used discernment
[1:51:05] in
[1:51:07] years you just swallow anything believe
[1:51:10] anything surf every internet preacher in
[1:51:13] the message and go from one sermon to
[1:51:16] the next and the next thing you know now
[1:51:18] Hey listen I'm just telling cuz one time
[1:51:21] I told you stay away from that and
[1:51:23] everything and and people thought I was
[1:51:25] forbidding them no you want to you go
[1:51:27] ahead but you better discern the
[1:51:30] spirit next thing you know you'll be
[1:51:32] acting just like they
[1:51:36] do
[1:51:38] huh now I want to ask
[1:51:41] you when the holy spirit moves and some
[1:51:45] of the greatest anointings in the
[1:51:47] prophet's Ministry said look beyond all
[1:51:50] the healings beyond all the signs and
[1:51:52] all of that he said this week has been
[1:51:55] the climax of my life talking about the
[1:51:57] opening of the seals I want to ask you
[1:51:59] how are they acting while he's
[1:52:02] preaching how was he
[1:52:05] preaching
[1:52:07] quietly now he says there in questions
[1:52:10] and answers between the six and seven
[1:52:12] seal now I know you don't get it I know
[1:52:14] you're not supposed to get it yeah but
[1:52:16] brother Ram aren't we no no no I know
[1:52:18] you're not getting it he said just stay
[1:52:21] simple yeah but brother no just stay
[1:52:25] simple see the next thing is hey I tell
[1:52:28] you what if you ain't catching what I'm
[1:52:29] telling you something's wrong with you
[1:52:31] you need to get into the next thing you
[1:52:33] know you get into the spirit of what
[1:52:35] he's
[1:52:37] saying and you're siding with that and
[1:52:39] next thinging you know he's pulling you
[1:52:40] out and you didn't even know
[1:52:43] it now I want to ask you when it's the
[1:52:47] revelation of the word that stimulates
[1:52:49] you it's okay to say Amen it's okay to
[1:52:52] stand up and shout it's okay to do that

[2:11:15] dance but you get it on with thousands
[2:11:18] of people guess what you'll be doing
[2:11:19] what they do I'm just talking about
[2:11:22] sometimes what happens we get one
[2:11:24] another Spirit instead of the Holy
[2:11:26] Spirit we want to discern
[2:11:29] Spirits
[2:11:33] now you don't have to manufacture

[2:17:48] my quotes I told you that
[2:17:51] it may be two or three parts to this let
[2:17:54] me just give you a couple quotes here
[2:17:56] and musicians if you
[2:18:00] come Brian Debbie it's good to see you
[2:18:03] guys bless
[2:18:07] you eesan Church
[2:18:10] age thou H has tried them that say they
[2:18:13] are Apostles and are not and has found
[2:18:15] them
[2:18:18] Liars my that's a blunt statement
[2:18:22] thou has tried them who call themselves
[2:18:25] Apostles isn't that
[2:18:28] presumptuous what right has a people to
[2:18:30] try those who call themselves
[2:18:34] Apostles and how do they try them oh I
[2:18:38] love this here it is Galatians 1
[2:18:42] and8 but though we are an angel from
[2:18:45] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[2:18:48] than which we have already preached to
[2:18:51] you let him be a
[2:18:54] curse it was the apostles who brought
[2:18:56] the original word to the people that
[2:18:58] original word could not change not even
[2:19:01] a daughter a
[2:19:02] dash Paul knew it
[2:19:06] was God who had spoken to him so he said
[2:19:09] even if I come and try to give a second
[2:19:12] Revelation try to make one little
[2:19:15] change and what I gave originally let me
[2:19:18] be a curse you see Paul knew that the
[2:19:21] first revelation was correct God gave
[2:19:23] him the first revelation then a second
[2:19:24] Revelation if he did he would be
[2:19:26] changing his
[2:19:28] mind but God's word can't
[2:19:31] change the seed came exactly as revealed
[2:19:36] Hallelujah and you see what these false
[2:19:39] Apostles are were doing they came with
[2:19:41] their own word these Ephesians knew that
[2:19:46] word as Paul had taught it they were
[2:19:48] full of the Holy Ghost by the laying on
[2:19:50] of Paul's hands they looked those false
[2:19:53] Apostles in their eye and said you're
[2:19:55] not saying what Paul said you are
[2:19:57] therefore false oh that sets my heart on
[2:20:00] fire get back to the word it's not you
[2:20:03] that really tries the Apostle and
[2:20:06] prophet and teacher it's the word that
[2:20:09] tries
[2:20:12] them one of these days there's going to
[2:20:15] come a prophet to the lusian church age
[2:20:19] and you'll know if he's a real one sent
[2:20:21] from God or not yes you will for if he
[2:20:25] is of God he will be in that word
[2:20:27] exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't
[2:20:31] deviate from that word for a moment not
[2:20:34] by one iot in that last stage when
[2:20:38] there'll be many false prophets
[2:20:40] appearing watch and see how they're
[2:20:43] keeping telling you that if you don't
[2:20:44] believe them and what they say you'll be
[2:20:48] lost but when that last day prophet
[2:20:51] comes on the scene he's if he is truly
[2:20:54] that Prophet he'll be crying get back to
[2:20:57] the word or you're lost he won't build
[2:20:59] on a private Revelation or
[2:21:01] interpretation but on the
[2:21:04] word
[2:21:06] amen
[2:21:08] God help
[2:21:10] us to have discernment of
[2:21:15] spirit I'm not going
[2:21:18] after anyone any church Church any
[2:21:22] preacher
[2:21:25] no I just
[2:21:30] watch I came into this message
[2:21:33] 1971 I've seen him come and
[2:21:36] [Music]
[2:21:37] go I've seen the jumping I've seen the
[2:21:42] shouting I've seen all kinds of
[2:21:44] anointings
[2:21:47] [Music]
[2:21:53] quite
[2:21:55] honestly in many
[2:22:00] ways I get so
[2:22:04] disappointed in what some of the guys
[2:22:06] are preaching some of the
[2:22:08] [Music]
[2:22:10] ministry I say oh
[2:22:16] God why don't you just take me home
[2:22:21] I feel like
[2:22:23] Paul oh you would have plucked out your
[2:22:26] eyes and given them to me if you could
[2:22:30] and Paul said in the scripture but now
[2:22:33] you hate me because I tell you truth yes
[2:22:36] amen saints of God I'm not here to
[2:22:37] tickle your
[2:22:39] ears I'm not here to sit here and try to
[2:22:42] drum something
[2:22:44] up I'm not I'm here to tell you what he
[2:22:48] said I want to take the movements of
[2:22:51] what's going on right now within the
[2:22:54] message and I want to discern
[2:22:57] it and I want to try the spirits and see
[2:23:00] if they're of God because you know what
[2:23:03] if you're not careful you'll get one
[2:23:05] another Spirit next thing you know
[2:23:06] you're out on a limb you're way out here
[2:23:10] and I had a brother very very nice
[2:23:12] brother I went to his home I was in the
[2:23:15] same meeting in hangle Hof
[2:23:18] Belgium his children
[2:23:21] children he had six seven children I
[2:23:24] [Music]
[2:23:26] forget and they all fell during those
[2:23:30] meetings and so we were visiting his
[2:23:33] house he said I want you children to
[2:23:36] come here and tell brother Ron how you
[2:23:38] got the holy ghost at the
[2:23:40] meetings good they got up here oh
[2:23:43] brother Ron we were in the meetings and
[2:23:45] guess what he said be sealed of God and
[2:23:46] I fell over and I got the Holy Ghost
[2:23:49] okay next next one all the way down
[2:23:52] stair step all the way
[2:23:54] down and I I told the brother I said
[2:23:58] brother I says I pray that that be the
[2:24:01] truth I said but these will be - tested
[2:24:05] Memorials of God we'll see if that was
[2:24:07] the Holy Ghost you'll see them they'll
[2:24:09] go on unto Perfection right they'll just
[2:24:12] keep going I said but I want to ask you
[2:24:15] my brother on the day of Pentecost the
[2:24:17] only thing that fell was the Holy Ghost
[2:24:22] I said Believers didn't fall nowhere in
[2:24:25] the scripture does it says and they fell
[2:24:27] when the Holy Ghost fell on them it says
[2:24:30] they spake words as the Holy Ghost did
[2:24:34] give them
[2:24:35] utterance I said but I'll show you in
[2:24:37] the scripture that when somebody is cast
[2:24:39] to the ground it's an evil spirit throws
[2:24:42] him into the fire throws him onto the
[2:24:44] ground throws him into the water come on
[2:24:46] now you know your Bible
[2:24:50] the brother said you just blasphemed the
[2:24:52] Holy
[2:24:53] Ghost I said I'm sorry get out of my
[2:24:58] house take your family right now and get
[2:25:00] out of my house you blaspheme the Holy
[2:25:03] Ghost I said brother I didn't blaspheme
[2:25:05] the Holy
[2:25:06] Ghost I said I just told you truth I
[2:25:10] said but the day will come I said wait
[2:25:12] and watch if your kids got the Holy
[2:25:14] Ghost they'll go on within a couple two
[2:25:17] three years where were they
[2:25:22] playing in a rock band this and that
[2:25:25] long hair girls no longer wearing
[2:25:30] dresses discern the
[2:25:35] spirit
[2:25:37] oh I wish to
[2:25:40] God that everyone
[2:25:42] here was born
[2:25:45] again and went on unto the adoption
[2:25:50] not all sons are
[2:25:52] obedient I want to ask you what's the
[2:25:54] difference between the wise and foolish
[2:25:58] virgin oil what is oil a sign of Holy
[2:26:02] Spirit foolish virgin never got
[2:26:05] oil
[2:26:07] therefore the time
[2:26:10] come when behold the bridegroom cometh
[2:26:14] and there was a movement oh we need the
[2:26:16] Holy Spirit we need oil we need oil in
[2:26:19] our lamb

[2:26:38] oil go and
[2:26:41] buy and while they went to get oil guess
[2:26:44] what he
[2:26:45] came and the door was
[2:26:49] closed and and there was weeping and
[2:26:51] wailing and nashing at teeth we're in
[2:26:53] that day when there's going to be people
[2:26:55] seeking the real baptism of the Holy
[2:26:57] Ghost it ain't going to be there why if
[2:27:01] you're going to seek God you seek him
[2:27:03] now you don't wait till California sinks
[2:27:07] oh now I know he's a prophet oh now I
[2:27:09] know now I'll get real serious no I tell
[2:27:12] you what you get serious right
[2:27:15] now you get serious right
[2:27:18] now Heavenly Father
[2:27:25] Lord help us to have discernment of
[2:27:28] spirit that's why so many
[2:27:31] people have so many problems because
[2:27:34] they fail to discern the spirit that's
[2:27:37] trying to draw them out to discern the
[2:27:39] spirit of the world creeping in discern
[2:27:41] the
[2:27:42] spirit of getting one another Spirit
[2:27:45] instead of the Holy
[2:27:47] Spirit then they think well God's reject
[2:27:50] Ed
[2:27:51] me well maybe there's nothing to this
[2:27:55] message maybe I'll just go do my
[2:27:58] thing because I
[2:28:01] tried I was in
[2:28:05] Earnest it seemed like I didn't get
[2:28:08] it well my brother my sister ever who
[2:28:12] you
[2:28:13] are just keep going it's not going to be
[2:28:17] According to some man telling you Jesus
[2:28:20] keeps all his
[2:28:22] appointments if you're a son or daughter
[2:28:24] of God guess
[2:28:26] what if you never met
[2:28:28] him he's there's going to be a time when
[2:28:31] you meet
[2:28:32] him may not even be in in
[2:28:37] church might be when you're
[2:28:40] alone for when Jacob was
[2:28:43] left
[2:28:45] alone that's when he wrestled with god
[2:28:49] father God I commit this service into
[2:28:52] thy hands and ask you to be with each
[2:28:55] one may they begin to start
[2:28:57] using spiritual
[2:28:59] discernment when the true church catches
[2:29:02] a true revelation of who she
[2:29:06] is and by God's spirit
[2:29:10] discerns and
[2:29:13] withstands that spirit that Antichrist
[2:29:16] spirit that is among the
[2:29:18] church then and only then will she stand
[2:29:22] as an invincible Army therefore father I
[2:29:25] pray May everything that we do and say
[2:29:28] be based upon the word not on sensation
[2:29:31] I'm not against sensation I'm not
[2:29:33] against
[2:29:35] tongues but give me the word
